<p>時評</p>
<h3>兩年來之考古發掘事業及其貢獻　鄭師許</h3>
<p>按中國之考古發掘工作，自「北京人」發見後·已成爲中國學術界之重要貢獻，年來各地發掘古墓之消息，時有披露，惟斷片零星，閲者殊難得其端緒，本報二十二年年鑑，曾特請李濟之君爲綜合的紀述，今又約鄭君編寫此有統系之文，特先發表，以供研究此問題者之快覩。</p>
<p>我國考古事業，近兩年來，確有顯著之進展及切實之貢獻，卽以中央研究院所主持之發掘工作而論，兩年間已達至十三次之多。茲以時次列爲簡表如下··</p>
<p>（一）民國二十二年四月一日至五月二十八日丨河南濬縣辛村第三次發掘　　（二）民國二十二年十月二十日至十二月二十五日丨第八次殷虚發掘　　（三）民國二十二年十月二十日至十二月十日丨第四次濬縣辛村發掘　　（四）民國二十二年十月二十四日至十一月三十日丨山東滕縣安上村第一次發掘　　（五）民國二十二年十月二十六日至十一月三十日丨安上村東曹王墓第一次發掘　　（六）民國二十二年十一月十五至二十三年一月二十四丨第三次安陽後岡發掘　　（七）民國二十三年九日至三月三十一日丨第九次殷虚發掘　　（八）民國二十三年三月十五日至五月二十二日丨第四次後岡發掘　　（九）民國二十三年四月二日至六月二日丨第二次安陽侯家莊發掘丨武官村發掘　　（十）民國二十三年五月二日至五月十七日丨河南鞏縣馬峪溝埸坡村第一次發掘　　（十一）民國二十三年五月二十一日至二十九日丨河南廣武縣陳溝村隞王頂第一　　　　　次發掘</p>
<p>（十二）民國二十三年十月二日丨第十殷虚發掘侯家莊發掘，是年底尙未訖工　　（十三）民國二十三年十月十五日至十一月十五日丨第二次廣武縣發掘在此兩年内之發掘，雖半爲賡續舊日工作，然爲探檢黑陶與彩陶文化分佈及接觸地域起見，主持者乃有沿黃河南岸調查發掘之計畫。河南鞏縣，廣武縣之試掘，卽爲其工作之第一步。而年來其他各方對考古工作之與趣，亦因以引起，如河南之古蹟研究會，山東大學敎授及實習生等，皆起而參加工作也。發掘結果，其所貢獻於我國古史者，亦頗有可述。約略言之，可得三項··</p>
<p>一、殷商建築文化之明瞭······商代建築基礎，在第七次發掘時已有發見。第八次發掘，復得版築房屋基址兩座，除石礎之外，並得銅鑄基礎十個。版築之下，復發現黑陶時代穴居之大圓坑，與連年發掘者，得相當之聯絡。第二次侯家莊發掘時，復發見殷人居住之大圓穴洞，建築基址，版築，石礎，土階，地窖，與小屯殷虚無異。於是殷代建築文化，得以明瞭。</p>
<p>二、殷商文化程度之測定······商代文化爲自石器時代進入銅器時代之一關鍵，徵之歷次出土器物，已無疑義。惟於殷虚文化層内，又時時有未曾冶煉過之銅鑛石，紅燒土碎塊，木炭，及可供煉錩用者「將軍盔」發現，卽可推定殷人冶鑄銅器之方法也。</p>
<p>三、殷商文化分佈實况之證實······商代文區域爲自黃河以南東迄山東一帶，昔年王國維已有此假定。在此兩年來發掘之結果，尤足證明此説不謬。甲骨文字爲殷虚所獨有，而城子崖之陶器文字，字體與之相近。至於卜用甲骨，則山東城子崖，安上村，等地，亦屢有發見，均經鑽灼，與殷墟出土者大同小異，確受有殷商文化之影響。又黑陶文化，最初爲城子崖所發見，爲山東一帶所獨有，今則濬縣辛村，安陽後岡，侯家莊，鞏縣塌坡村等均有之。其出土器物，又與城子崖下層文化期同。第三次濬縣發掘時，並得陶窑一座，甚爲完全。此可見兩地文化交流分佈之大槪矣。</p>
<p>此外則北平研究院史學研究會，與陜西考古會，於二十三年二三月間主持發掘陜西民政府廳内之唐代興慶宫及大明宫遺址，所得兩宫圖石，附比例尺頗精，所裨益於考古學界者，亦匪淺尠。</p>
<p>共因癹掘結果，而印行報告之專集··在二十二年時有西北科學考查團印行之高吕陶集。而中央研究院之城子崖發掘報告已有出版預告殷墟發掘報告則正在整理編輯中。</p>
<p>同時，考古團體，除前時已成立之西北科學考查團，廣州黃花考古學院等外，民國二十二年五月十四日上海成立中國考古會，二十三年春間西安成立陜西考古會，二十三年九月一日北平成立考古學社等。考古學社爲南北考古學者所發起組織，已發行社刋一種，考古專集三種，考古叢書，甲編一種，乙編三種，專爲研究上的工作。　　此外有必須記述者二事··一爲考試院院長戴傳賢電請保護古墓之議，一爲行政院長汪兆銘軍事委員會委員長蔣中正通電保護古物之令。關於反對發掘古墓之往復函電，詳見燕京學報第十五期中。至汪蔣通電，則申述中央古物保管會工作綱要，望全國恊助進行發揚民族精神。並於二十三年七月十二日在行政院成立中央古物保管委員會，於十二月十七日通過採掘古物規則，採掘古物申請事項表，古物出境申請事項表等。此於開發中復寓保護之意，可謂雙方兼顧。意者今後盜墓之風，及偷運古物出口之事，可以止息。凡此皆可以促我考古事</p>
<p>業之進展者也。</p>
<h3>高橋財政政策與軍閥意見對立</h3>
<p>警告勿無限制對滿投資</p>
<p>英報認爲足以挽救憲政</p>
<p>（東京）高橋藏相在八日之閣議、報告去年國際貸借、並論及對滿投資統制及滿洲事件費、陸軍參謀本部對此表示意見如下、（一）藏相憂慮對滿投資、截至現在尙未獲利、以此觀點主張大規模之投資、反對無統制之小公司之亂立、其統治投資之動機 與軍部相異、故不得不反對、惟對滿投資係一國策、起初當可無惜犧牲、（二）藏相又憂慮資金之流入中國、反對軍部對滿洲之經濟政策、但滿洲之採用银本位者、實爲不得已之事、偶因中國亦採用銀本位、致稍流出、因無反對軍部之</p>
<p>理、但對此欲考慮對策、（三）藏相反對繼續支出滿洲事件費、但俄軍乏威脅日大、實</p>
<p>狀不許取消預算也、藏相又憂慮因滿洲事件費之鉅、影響國際貸借關係、並流漏‏</p>
<p>資本、此爲近視眼的觀察也、職任藏相者其言須謹愼矣、（十日華聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）日本高橋藏相昨日在内閣會議中、發表關於財政問題之演説、泰晤士報頃加以評論、謂此項演説殊關重要、高橋以日本財政困難之情形警告其國人、然其演説用意尙不止此、蓋高橋不啻公然反對軍部領袖之主張也、近年以來、内閣文官成爲陸海軍部之囊中物、固已數見不鮮、日本與論因數次發生財政舞弊案、對於政黨深政其不滿、反之對於陸海軍鉅額軍費之要索則樂于接受、此則半由於命運主義之感覺、半亦由於虚榮及愛國心增强之所致、國家宣傳、往往爲呌囂無已之現役軍人所獨佔、此在日本亦然、惟最近内閣中文官亦凖備就財政方面批評軍事政策、如前任藏相籐井雖最後陷於坎軻之境、然其在職時削减軍費要求反對軍事預算、可謂竭盡能事、此種軍事預算共所根據之理論、卽日本早晩有戰爭之虞是也、今高橋復長財政、雖不若籐井之公然反對軍事預算、然賴其經騐之宏富、國際聲譽之廣大、其所作警告必能獲得力量、且於軟弱無能之日本政黨政治、則尤爲强身之補劑也云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦泰唔士報今日社論批評日本預算案之地位、言及日藏相高橋昨向内閣警告、勿無限制投資滿洲事、謂事有較諸高橋警告更饒意味者、爲高橋已公然與軍閥相抗、近年來平民閣員似已成軍人之囊中物、而宣傳已成軍人之專利品、國雖日亟、非政客所能、應付之説、無日不喧騰衆口、前藏相藤井雖卒遭排斥、曾竭其力以裁制軍人之要求、高橋雖尙未有此舉動、但以其經騐與聲望、渠之警告、當愈有力、或可使日本黨派政治近已陷日本于元氣大傷之狀態中者受良好影響云、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國繼續購銀</h3>
<p>但避免引起銀價劇烈波動</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美聯社今日得悉、美國政府雖經遠東方面反對、仍將繼續購買大批現銀、惟將用最低之價、而財部於購銀之時、亦將避免引起世界銀價之劇烈波動、日來盛傳財部購銀已漸减少、今日該部官員則稱、財長毛根鞱已聲明、决將盡力完成一九三四年之購銀法云、財部方面亦稱、預算案中所載白銀鑄幣餘利一項、並不表示政府究將購買白銀幾何、惟官塲方面則表示鉅額之購銀計劃仍將進行、上海消息所傳財長已允許中國緩和購銀計劃以免銀價激增、並允另用他法購銀、以免减少中國存銀之説、國會銀派議員對之、仍非常注意、益以財部减少購銀之説、彼等遂更欲早日成立議案、該派領袖本不希望其能有何重要結果、惟以當時彼等自身意見紛歧、遂未能成立命令式之法案耳、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參議員卜普今日聲稱、白銀每盎斯値一元三角九分分應爲銀派之目標、財部未能盡力在世界市塲購買白銀、應在國内外繼續購買白銀、卜普估計九角六分爲最小限度之銀價、此項銀價能使開採銀礦一致獲利、彼願擁護金銀比價十六與一之比之議案云、（九日國民電）</p>

<p>薩爾各派對峙</p>
<h3>示威情勢洶洶</h3>
<p>國際歌與日耳曼歌齊唱</p>
<p>列寗像與希特勒像並懸</p>
<p>投票結果現已可以豫卜</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根今日對峙黨派之示威者、幾起衝突、幸警察支隊迅速馳至、得免肇禍、日耳曼陣綫之隊員與主張維持薩爾現局者今日盛集車站、以迎由美歸此之投票人若干、但客未如期而至、雙方示威者忽開始狂喊、彼此醜祇、並紛唱國際歌及日耳曼國歌、當時情勢洶洶、衝突似難倖免、惟日耳曼陣綫之領袖曾竭力約束同志、直至警察到塲始已、</p>
<p>此間各街道一切如常、惟某馬克斯派員所開之商店、曾陳列列寗之肖像、許多商店之窗中、則列有國社黨領袖之肖像與半身塑型、並國社主義之文字、外表雖皆如常、但骨裏人心極爲緊張、有散發僞傳單、宣布及希特勒之天主敎聯合會已被解散者、蓋以該會不能與不信上帝之共産黨結合故也、又聞主張保留現局之居民、亦散發僞託希特勒忠實黨員署名之傳單、雙方皆圖肴亂是非、以遂其志願、當局深慮星期日各處票匭運至此間總檢票處時、中途有被盜之虞、故已作縝密之戒備、一面並防備搗亂之行爲、今日聞載運票匭之特别火車、將派外兵駐衛、並有摩托敞車坦克砲車武裝汽車摩托自動車隨行保護、投票之結果似可預决、但衆料主張維持現局之票、佔數必在總票數百分之二十至四十之間、</p>
<p>據倫敦電訊、孟却斯德指導報載稱按照凡爾賽和約、國聯得按投票之比較的力量瓜分薩爾、但列强顯願保留薩爾之完整云、又據倫敦另一消息、英國曾出面向德國探詢他日國聯行政院開會討論薩爾公民投票之結果時、德國願否派代表出席、而迄未接覆、惟關於薩爾投票之近今一切佈置、均與德國密切合作進行、按德國原可參與國聯行政院會議、至十月爲止、但自德政府照會退出國聯後、從未出席國聯任何會議、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根薩爾居民因投票日期將屆、漸露不安之象、近兩星期以内現欵運移邊界法國方面之銀行者、實繁有徒、其數達一萬萬佛郎、蓋恐公民投票後、該欵將被扣留也、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根薩爾區域公民投票於一月十三日舉行、惟公務人員監獄犯人及醫院病人、則提前於一月七八九三日、先行投票、三日中計共投一千零三十四票、其中醫院病人四百八十人、公務人員三百六十人、監犯一百九十四人、按准許提前投票者、預計當有二千二百人、而醫院病人尙不在内、可見實行投票之人數甚屬寥寥、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>希特勒代表痛詆法外長</h3>
<p>謂爲鼓勵分裂運動</p>
<p>（柏林）希特勒所派辦理薩爾問題之專使布爾克爾、今日在巴伐里亞凱撒宫發激烈之演説、痛詆法外賴伐爾、謂賴氏鼓勵薩爾分立派妄信尙可舉行第二次公民投票、此實幻想、布氏並斥基督敎徒加入共産黨而主張維持薩爾現局、此種行爲、實屬借基督之名、行賣國之實、布氏末乃否認薩爾公民投票後將設拘禁營之説、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>該撒斯勞頓德元首希特勒所任命之薩爾區域特派員貝格爾氏、今日在此向各國新聞記者發表宣言、對於星期日舉行之民衆投票首作樂觀之論調、稱自一月十三日始、和洽之道已通行無阻、」云、貝氏復稱、目前舉世之人俱問星期日之事孰勝孰敗云云、此種疑問若加以國際意義之探討、則投票之後、無論誰勝誰敗、投票完畢之日、卽將爲競爭開始之時、因投票全部問題自始至終將成爲德法兩國爭競之焦點也、但倘能將目前之眞實問題加以良知之考慮、則覺薩爾問題已非國際政治爭競之問題、而未解决以前種種錯誤之途徑、將來薩爾問題在國際討論範圍之内移去之後、則所謂薩爾問題者、純粹一德國之事、因該事惟德人可以解决之也、貝氏繼復論及投票之後、現狀或將延長之可能性、彼謂此種可能性係屬一種無誠意之設想、藉以隠蔽投票之意義者也、倘國聯同意在將來再舉行第二次投票者、則薩爾法規將爲此破壞無遺、因所謂現狀之維持及維持之期限等等、此後薩爾之民衆將無從過問、而以後一切措施、悉將聽命於德國國境以外之政治事件及外國政府之意旨矣、惟薩爾境内之德籍人民、無論如何均不願以自身前途之命運託諸外人及外國政府之手、故凡欲使現狀之延長者、其目的卽可使薩爾永遠與德國祖邦分離而已、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>國聯今日開會</h3>
<p>波斯與伊拉克之爭</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政院第八十四屆會議定明日開幕、此殆爲日本退出國聯之通告發生效力以前最後一次會議、日本所代管島嶼之前途問題、開會後或將討論及之、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會行政院常會於一月十一日開幕、由土耳其外長魯舒第主席、第一次會議、大約當於下星期二日開始、列入本屆會議日程之議案有三十餘件之多、其中最重要者則爲薩爾問題與伊拉克波斯兩國間之邊境爭端、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）波斯頃以備忘錄致國聯、聲明對於伊拉克邊界爭端之立塲、伊拉克前曾根據國聯盟約第十一條第二項提出抗議、謂波斯不遵守一九一四年之邊界恊定、而欲取得阿拉伯河之主權、波斯外長茲復對記者宣稱、今茲爭執係英俄恊定及一九一四年强迫波斯接受邊界條約所産生、上類條約迄未得波斯及前土耳其國會所接受、伊拉克嗣成一獨立國、加入國聯、波斯固極盼將邊境重新規定、如土耳其共和國所爲者然、乃伊拉克政府拒而不納、故波斯意欲根據慣例以河之中心爲界、而不允以一九一四年所定以河岸爲界也云云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）蘇聯政府頃向國聯繳納一九三五年第一季會費、此舉實較其他各國爲先、蘇聯駐法代辦羅珊培、業奉派充任國聯會帮辦秘書、至國聯會所屬各委員會中蘇聯代表、將由行政院在本屆會期中分别指派、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>中國有獲得國聯理事希望</h3>
<p>（巴黎）意相墨索里尼與法外長賴伐爾日前在羅馬會談時、對國聯問題有所討論、如果德國復入國聯、將增加一理事席、同時對亞洲亦將增設一席、俾中國有護得之機會云、（十日世界電）</p>
<h3>英國注意新加坡防務</h3>
<p>新加坡聞昆士蘭行政長官威爾森請假二月、游歴東方、行將來游新加坡、此聞行係純粹私人性質、但關於英帝國國防委員會秘書漢基近發表之報告、可信威爾森殆注意於新埠之防務也、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>法閣議通過意法羅馬恊約</h3>
<p>提交國會批准</p>
<p>（巴黎）今晨舉行國務會議、由外交部長賴伐爾對於羅馬恊定、提出詳細説明幾佔會議之全部時間、旋由内閣予以通過、當向賴氏慰勞、並授權賴氏、將恊定原文提交兩院批准、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）外交部頃發表羅馬恊定之分析、謂其中關於菲洲殖民地問題、法意條約業將兩國間懸案作最後之解决、關於中歐問題、兩國政府一致認爲各國重行申明、尊重他國領士獨立及完整之義務、爲兩國所主張之原則、此種原則、足以發展中歐部分各國間信任之情感云、最後法意恊定載明、墨索里尼與賴伐爾承認未來各種爭執問題、均可提交國聯會、依照盟約所規定之程序、予以解决云、（九日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（羅馬）今晨各報評論法意恊定之範圍、意大利日報謂、此項恊定、其主要性質乃屬政治的、外傳羅馬恊定具有財政恊定之形式、規定法國以現金接濟意大利、實屬不確、意大利方面旣未作此種要求、且將來亦不至作此種要求云、泛繫黨工作報則謂法意恊定創造歐洲政治之一新階段、開闢意國與小恊商各國共同行動之門户云、（九日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>法外長接見俄奧公使</h3>
<p>土外長晤南斯拉夫外長</p>
<p>（巴黎）外長賴伐爾自羅馬返國後、卽往訪佛蘭亭總理、報告羅馬談判經過、繼謁見勒蒲侖總統、面呈法意恊定之全文、總統慰賀有加、午後、賴伐爾復接見蘇聯駐法大使波湯金及奧國駐法大使摩埃爾瓦特、星期五日又須啟程赴日内瓦出席國聯會行政院會議、（九日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>貝爾格勒　土耳其外長魯希悌於赴日内瓦之時、路經此處、曾作二十四小時之勾留、乘機與總理葉夫的區作長時間之談話、葉氏且兼任外長、魯希悌並曾晉謁攝政保祿親王、其所討論者、聞以巴爾幹恊約各國對於法意之羅馬恊約應取之態度爲主云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英掌爾大臣艾登在愛登堡演説、謂法意恊定實爲穏固歐洲和平之重要成續云、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄懷疑法意恊約實力</h3>
<p>謂其尙未完全妥恊</p>
<p>（莫斯科）伊斯維斯太報對法意恊定有所評論、其言曰、「法意兩國果已有全部之恊定乎、目下羅馬方面之消息、對此問題尙未能致答、今日兩國雖有證明其意見完全一致之議定書、然此尙不能謂彼等已有完全之恊定、蓋此類普通聲明、初無拘束任何方國之實效也、法意兩國在關於奧國之議定書中、表示願意維持奧國之獨立、並稱、奧國獨立如遇何種危險、彼等當出面磋商、此項議定書如僅止於此、别無更具體之内容、則人將追問曰、豈在此以前法意兩國不願維持奧國之獨立乎、彼等一遇奧國法西黨徒抨轚之際、彼等豈未嘗商討乎、整個問題乃在下述一點、卽法意兩國如遇奧國發生危險時、果能一致行動乎、此種諒解如未完成、則羅馬恊定旣不能增强奧國之安全、更無裨於其他有關各國之安全、至於邀請其他國家加入一節、吾人以爲舉凡奧國鄰國除德國以外均能允許、吾人甚且以爲卽如德國亦關於奧國獨立問題亦無不欲加入之理由、至地獄之途、盡是冠冕堂皇之聲明、設無嚴重之保障、設無實際之行動以踐其所言、歐洲决無和平可言、羅馬談判正如英報所言、得爲一種願爲法德之間建設橋樑創製若干有利條件之表現、英國外交家正循此方向努力、此事無他、僅爲獲取德國方面適量之高調與文件、而允許德國軍擴之合法權利耳、」伊斯維斯太報稱、蘇聯恒願以合作之方法、解决一般問題、並願締結東方區域公約、以此能鞏固東歐人民之安全也、其他各個區域問題亦須如此解决、同時唯有嚴格規定參加人員之權利與義務之恊定、乃有重量、如羅馬恊定確能滿足此等要求、則莫斯科方面當予贊成「云、（九日塔斯電）</p>

<p>討論穏定幣價</p>
<p>（倫敦）據倫敦金融界今日所得消息、此次法國總理佛蘭亭及外長賴伐爾於一月下旬來游倫敦之時、將提起英鎊與法郎之匯價穏固問題、惟倫敦專家則以爲法國此項建議在目前定將失敗、猶憶英國財長張伯倫於耶穌聖誕節前在下院演説、曾表示美元與法郎之匯價不穏、將使英鎊之穏定難於成就、再現在盛傳法國要人來此、除穏定匯價之外、並將討論最近在歐洲發展之種種問題、其最重要者大槪爲重開軍縮會議、最近之意法恊約、英法商務及東歐公約諸間題云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間金融界現盛傳穏定匯價之謡言、據可恃方面消息、國務院得悉歐洲用金國之代表不日往遊倫敦時、將討論穏定幣價問題、但羅總統已表示、美國在國際貨幣情勢中未必卽有舉動、據此間人士傳説、歐陸諸國雖亟欲穏定幣値、倫敦方面猶以爲時機未熟、但預料法比荷三國皆將以其壓力施諸英國、而圖會英國與美國恊定一種穏定幣値之辦法（十日路透電）</p>

<p>一九三四年上半期的煤炭産額，雖較前兩年稍見恢復，然而還不及一九二九年十三萬萬噸的産額。但這並不能説是燃料减退，因爲煤炭的地位，漸爲煤油替代的緣故。一九三四年世界煤油的産額，雖沒有找到統計，可是一九三三年巳有了新記錄，一九三四年煤油的産額，當然不在上年之下·而有激增的趨勢。茲將近二十年來煤油生産額比較如次··</p>
<p>（據英國煤油恊會調查，單位百萬噸）</p>

<p>一九二八年　　　一二四、二</p>

<p>一九三三年　　　　　一九四、三</p>
<p>動力中，因爲電氣化的關係，各國莫不爭相發展力，故電氣的生産與銷費之增加，也可證明軍需工業發展之一斑。即就美國而言，一九三四年上半期比較前兩年，都增加了。　　美國電氣生産及銷費指數</p>
<p>每月平均　　生産　　　消費</p>
<p>一九三二年　七○·九　八七·五</p>
<p>一九三三年　八四·九　八七·五</p>
<p>一九三四年　九四·一　一○七·一</p>
<p>（據國聯調查，消費指數以一九二三丨丨二五年平均爲一○○、生産指數則以推定水準爲一○○、因兩者的標準不同，故不能作消長的比較，只能生産消費各自比較）。</p>
<p>船舶工業，因幾年來，國祭貿易的萎縮，各國船舶工業漸趨不振。但在一九三三年下半期，漸呈起色·，至一九三四年，此種現象仍繼續維持。一九三四年世界船舶建造中的噸數統計，爲一百零七萬九千一百噸，比一九三三年年末，增加三十二萬一千八百噸。增加率，其中以美國爲最多，去年比前年同期，約增二倍。前年三月末僅二十五萬二千噸，而本年竟增至四十八萬一千噸，占全世界總額幾及半數。全世界除英匣外，餘爲五十九萬七千噸；其中日本，去年三月亦比上年同期增加一萬六千噸，其他如德·法·美·荷等國均有相當的增加。</p>
<p>汽車工業在一九三三年，全世界生産額，已有大有可觀。一九三二年全世界共生産一百九十七萬七千輛，一九三三年增爲二百六十七萬二千輛，美國一國一年之間，也增加了五十八萬八千輛（國聯調查）。一九三四年開始後，更爲激增，即在最初三個月，美國已生産七十三萬二千一百輛，比上年同期，約增加了百分之六十。英國汽車産額。一九三三年居然打破了空前紀錄，竟達二十八萬六千輛；蘇聯在一九三四年上半期，生産總額爲一萬六千零七十三輛，較上年同期亦顯然增加。（文化建設一巻三期七八頁）</p>
<p>汽車的構造，都有最新式的裝置，在很快的時間内，即可改裝爲戰車，這是値得注意的。我們雖不能否認一九三四年交通事業有相當的進步，然而汽車工業之發張，大半爲了準備戰爭，也是無可否認的。</p>
<p>根據經濟學一般的原則，生産增加，貿易亦必隨之而長進，但是一九三四年的世界貿易，恰與世界生産成反比例，這也可以證明生産和消費間的矛盾，完全沒有絲毫消失。茲將一九三四年上半期的世界貿易與前兩年比較如次··</p>
<p>輸入　　　　　輸出</p>

<p>（據日本新聞聯合社調查，「世界往何處去」一九三四年下半期八四頁）</p>
<p>德，法，意三國輸出的减少，實爲金本位國維持通貨價値的犠牲，而英美，日實行通貨膨脹的國家，輸出入都逐見增加。因此使金本位國更爲自危。同時，我們可看到列强同的對立的尖鋭化。這個尖鋭化，就是第二次世界大戰的導火綫。　　經濟恐慌的發展，不僅使農業與工業同時發生恐慌，而且兩者互相交錯，更使恐慌進入險惡之境。一九二九年所發生的恐慌，就是兩者交錯的序幕；此種恐慌直到一九三四年依然還是繼續不息。</p>
<p>一九三四年農業生産沒有起色，雖與氣候不順等有很大的關係，然而大半還是因爲農業恐慌之故。茲將主要原料品産額，列表如次··</p>
<p>棉花　　　　　生絲　　　羊毛</p>
<p>千包　　　　　包　　　　　百萬磅</p>
<p>一九二五丨二六年　　二六、五八○　　五七九、一二三　　三、○二二</p>

<p>調查者，　　　　　　　　紐約棉花　　　日本織物　　　　英國達而</p>
<p>交易所　　　　聯合會　　　　　格梓商會</p>
<p>一九三三年的生絲，羊毛的生産額，都較前年减少。一九三四年的預計當更爲縮减。小麥等的生産，亦很不振。再將四年來小麥，砂糖，樹膠的産額，列表如次··</p>
<p>小麥</p>
<p>百萬Ｂusulrel　千噸</p>
<p>一九三一年　　　　三、八四七　　　　二八、四七七</p>
<p>一九三二年　　　　三、八二二　　　　二六、三七七</p>
<p>一九三三年　　　　三、八○五　　　　二四、一四一</p>
<p>一九三四年（預計）三、六一三　　　　二五、五六九</p>
<p>砂糖生産，本有國際减産恊定的限制，然而依然有增加的現象，樹膠也在一九三四年四月二十九日成立了國際的减産恊定，限制全世界生産額不能超過一百零一萬九千噸；六月以後，更有一定的比率，使其逐漸减少生産，以免生産過剩之虞减産恊定，乃在恐慌期間，不得已的手段；一九三四年居然有此種現象發生，則一九三四年仍在恐慌的深渦中，自極明顯。</p>
<p>農業恐慌，又可從農産物價格的跌落上證明之。例如日本的蘭價，其跌落之狀，實爲萬人。</p>
<p>一九三四年　　一九三三年</p>
<p>白蘭（每貫）　三、○九圓　　五、五七圓</p>
<p>黃蘭（每貫）　　三、二六圓　　五、四一圓</p>
<p>（據日本一九三五年改造年鑑二一一頁）</p>
<p>這還是最高的價格，例如黃蘭普通的價格、都在二圓五角左右，較之上年，幾减一半。由此可以想像養蠢爲活的日本農民，其生活當如何困若了。　　（未完）</p>

<h3>幣制委員會章程及名單</h3>
<p>研究金銀問題之對策</p>
<p>國聞社云、財政部幣制研究委員會、自去年冬季在京成立、並於去年年底、設立駐滬辦事處、惟於該會章程、及全體委員之名單等、迄未對外公布、茲經發表如下、</p>

<h3>設辦事處</h3>
<p>財政部以該會委員、大都因公在滬、故特增設駐滬辦事處、一以溝通聲氣、再則附近於中央銀行之圖書室、可以充分參考世界經濟書報、隨時研究世界幣制問題及金銀問題等事項、以供委員會開會時提出討論、然後再根據會章第七條、將議决案送請財政部採擇施行、</p>
<h3>開會時期</h3>
<p>委員會規定每年開會兩次、均由南京會所召集、即在首都舉行、將來開會時間、現在尙未訂定、該會現對世界經濟潮流、時有變遷、以爲整頓國内之幣制、必謀適應世界之潮流、非然者、舍本逐末、無補時艱、故該會現正研究金銀問題之對策、一俟具有端倪、即行編列提案、用資探討云、</p>
<h3>郵滙副局長談東北滙兑</h3>
<p>二月一日方可實行</p>
<p>中央社云、我國自九一八後、關内外之郵路卽告斷絶、業經政府在不承認僞滿而謀關内外民間便利之原則下、以私人名義、創辦匯通轉遞局、辦理轉遞郵件、曁匯兑事宜、關於轉遞郵件一事、卽於昨日開始辦理、我國各地郵局自昨日起、收遞寄往東北之郵件、至於匯兑一事、以手續較繁、尙待二月一日方可實行、茲據郵政儲金匯業總局副局長徐柏園談話如下、以前狀况　徐氏首談、關於九一八案件未發生以前、本局在東北兼營儲蓄曁匯兑兩事、營業尙稱不惡、卽匯兑一項、亦年盈餘餘達三十餘萬元、儲蓄全額、其數亦不在少、此次恢復者惟匯兑一事、營業上較前必遜色不少云、</p>
<p>現在情形自九一八發生後、所有東北四省之儲匯事業、卽宣告停辦、但民間因事實上之需要、對於匯兑一事、仍委托銀行辦理、已習以爲常、故本局此次恢復</p>
<h3>市黨部通告絶對服用國貨</h3>
<p>奉中執會訓令轉告各同志</p>
<p>市黨部昨通告該部工作人員云、「爲通告事、案奉中央執行委員會訓令漾字第七六○號内開、查我國年來紗業衰落、廠肆凋敝、而洋貨充斥、溢於市塲、以至漏巵日鉅、入超激增、言念及此、可爲寒心、一方面固由於外商傾銷、及經營之不善、一方面則國人缺乏愛國思想、樂於購用外貨心理、亦屬爲厲之階、本會第四屆第五次全體會議討論關於救濟全國紗業推廣銷路一案、經議决辦法數項、除應由政府辦理者外、其第五項規定、「全國公務人員、黨務工作人員、各學校敎職員、及學生、須一律服用國貨、絶對禁止服用非國貨服裝、除分行外、合亟令仰知照、並轉飭所屬黨部、一體凛遵爲要、此令、等因、奉此、除分行外、合行通告仰本部工作同志一體遵照、勿違爲要、右通告本黨部工作同志、云云、</p>
<p>匯兑、除華北各省外、其他各處、關於匯兑營業上、無甚出入、</p>
<p>定期恢復、本局現尙未正式訓令所屬、辦理東北匯兑、蓋此事手續上較繁、或將委托銀行辦理、故尙待至二月一日方可實行、將來實行後、所有匯兑手續、仍與過去相同、惟本局則多一劃欵手續耳、</p>
<h3>吳淞口昨晨大霧通順進口擱淺</h3>
<p>昨午拖曳失敗</p>
<p>今日續往營救</p>
<p>本埠法租界天主堂街大通興輪船公司通順輪、載重三千噸、向來行駛北洋上海間、係專運貨物野旗船、不搭旅客、船主爲挪威人、此次由青島裝煤二千餘噸、開駛來滬、預定昨日抵埠、在漢冶平碼頭靠泊、起卸煤斤後卽開南京、昨日上午四時、船至吳淞港口、正擬乘潮駛入浦江、乃因昨晨吳淞口大霧迷漫、咫尺莫辨、航路爲之蔽沒、各海輪留停吳淞避霧者甚多、通順輪於重霧中、欲駛進上海、乃甫進淞口、卽錯誤航道、在沙灘上擱住、船主初尙欲打倒車退出、無如該輪滿裝煤斤、儎脚極重、已深陷沙灘中、無法移動、乃電滬求救、</p>
<p>營救無效該公司昨晨接到通順擱淺警訊、立向本埠會德豐公司、租用拖輪一艘、帶同工人等、趕駛吳淞、以便拖救、下午三時拖船到達、卽施行拖曳工作、無如該輪擱陷過深、潮水又未能盛漲、因之百計拖救、莫能曳動分毫、營救失敗、拖船遂卽退歸上海、公司報告、</p>
<p>今日續拖記者赴該公司詢問通順輪擱淺原因、據先行返滬之該輪船員言、通順船身、爲淺灘污泥陷吸、故第一次拖救、未能曳下、又據該船員及公司中人言、通順輪雖擱淺、並無損傷、亦未進水、預料今日下午漲潮時、可以將其設法拖出、故該公司已經凖備、於今日再派曳力較强之拖輪、前往營救云、</p>
<h3>航政局昨開始調處滬甬綫爭航潮</h3>
<p>先召各同盟公司主持人談話</p>

<p>新聲社云、行駛滬甬綫輪船、國營招商局之新江天·民營三北輪埠公司之寗興·寗紹商輪公司之新寗紹·英商太古公司之北京·等四輪、曾訂立同盟合作公約、實行水脚公攤、今三北公司、在鎭海自建碼頭、向怡和公司購進聯和輪、改爲明興、定明日試車、十四日開航、兼灣寗波後、各同盟公司表示反對招商局寗紹公司、已於前日呈請交通部上海航政局核辦、</p>
<p>航局停行調處上海航政局、接招商局寗紹公司呈請後、於前日卽令三北輪埠公司、將明興輪行駛滬鎭綫及滬甬綫同盟合作經過具復、以便核辦、昨日分别召集三北招商寗紹三公司負責人員談話、以便進行調處、惟該局希望各同盟公司抱過去合作精神、謀解决方法、至於各同盟公司、卽希望航政局主持公道、</p>
<p>公約恐將解散三北公司鎭海自建碼頭已完成、所費爲數頗鉅、况明興輪之行駛航綫、以長江下游及滬甬等處爲最適宜、今長江航業甚爲衰落、故非駛滬鎭綫不可、若令其放棄行駛、决不允許、但其他各公司反對甚烈、故同盟合作公約、恐將解散、或另行設立公約、三北雖占二輪、而所派之成數略减云、</p>

<h3>王新民何炳松等發表中國本位的文化建設</h3>
<p>宣言（二）</p>
<p>民國四五年之交、整個的中國陷在革命頓挫、内部危機四伏、外患侵入不已的苦悶中、一般人以爲政治不足以救國、需要文化的手段、於是就發生了以解放思想束縛爲中心的五四文化運動、經過這個運動、中國人的思想遂爲之一變、</p>
<p>新的覺醒要求新的活動、引導辛亥革命的中華革命黨遂應時改組、政治運動大爲展開、打倒軍閥打倒帝國主義的聲浪遍於全國、由此形成了一個偉大的國民革命、其間雖有種種波折、但經過了這幾年的努力、中國的政治改造終於達到了相當的成功、</p>
<p>這時的當前問題在建設國家、政治經濟等方面的建設旣已開始、文化建设工作亦當着手、而且更爲迫切、但將如何建設中國的文化、却是一個急待討論的問題、有人以爲中國該復古、但古代的中國已成歷史、歷史不能重演、也不需要重演、有人以爲中國應完全模仿英美、英美固有英美的特長、但地非英美的中國應有其獨特的意識形態、並且中國現在是在農業的封建的社會和工業的社會交嬗的時期、和已完全進到工業時代的英美、自有其不同的情形、所以我們决不能贊成完全模仿英美、除却主張模仿英美的以外、還有兩派、一派主張模仿蘇俄、一派主張模仿意德、但其錯誤和主張模仿英美的人完全相同、都是輕視了中國空間時間的特殊性、</p>
<p>目前各種不同的主張正在競走、中國已成了各種不同主張的血戰之塲、而透過各種不同主張的各種國際文化侵略的魔手也、正在暗中活躍、各欲爭取最後的勝利、我們難道能讓他們去混戰麽、</p>
<p>三·我們怎麽辦不、我們不能任其自然推移、我們要求有中國本位的文化建設、在建設的進程中、我們應有這樣的認識、一·中國是中國、不是任何一個地域、因而有它自已的特珠性、同時、中國是現在的中國、不是過去的中國、自有其一定的時代性、所以我們特别注意於此時此地的需要、此時此地的需要、就是中國本位的基礎、二·徒然贊美古代的中國制度思想、是無用的、徒然詛咒古代的中國制度思想、也一樣無用、必需把過去的一切、加以檢討、存其所當存、去其所當去、其可贊美的良好制度偉大思想、當竭力爲之發揚光大、以貢獻於全世界、而可詛咒的不良制度卑劣思想、則當淘汰務盡、無所吝惜、三·吸收歐美的文化是必要而且應該的、但須吸收其所當吸收、而不應以全盤承受的態度、連渣滓都吸收過來、吸收的標準、當决定於現代中國的需要、四·中國木位的文化建設、是創造、是迎頭趕上去的創造、其創造目的是使在文化領域中因失去特徵而沒落的中國和中國人、不僅能與别國和别國人並駕齊驅於文化的領域、並且對於世界的文化能有最珍貴的貢獻、五·我們在文化上建設中國、並不是抛棄大同的理想、是先建設中國、成爲一整個健全的單位、在促進世界大同上能有充分的力、要而言之、中國是旣要有自我的認識、也要有世界的眼光、旣要有不閉關自守的度量、也要有不盲目模仿的决心、這認識纔算得深切的認識、</p>
<p>循着這認識前進、那我們的文化建設就應是、不守舊、不盲從、根據中國本位、採取批評態度、應用科學方法來檢討過去、把握現在、創造將來、不守舊、是淘汰舊文化、去其渣滓、存其精英、努力開拓出新的道路、不盲從、是取長捨短、擇善而從、在從善如流之中、仍不昧其自我的認識、根據中國本位、棌取批判態度、應用科學方法來檢討過去、把握現在、創造將來、是要清算從前的錯誤、供給目前的需要、確定將來的方針、用文化的手段産生有光有熱的中國、使中國在文化的領域中能恢復過去的光榮、重新佔着重要的位置、成爲促進世界大同的一枝最勁最强的生力軍、（完）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　聞語掩啼痕賣身道苦留心窺請東投靠情殷</p>
<p>月英這才逼出一句話來，擦着眼淚道··多謝這位程老爺。説着，站起身來。在這時，那位坐在角落裏的王北海，忽然站了起來，將手一招道··慢走，我有話説。大家聽到，都不免呆了，他在這個時候，會有什麽話可説呢？他等月英站住了，却並不向月英説話，回轉臉來，向胡嫂子道··我聽程先生説的這番話，也很替你們可憐。不過我的力量有限，不能幫你們的大忙，我這包袱裏，由家裏帶了六七斤𩟠來，可以分一半給你們。説着··就把放在桌上的包袱，給解了開來，露出裏面，有二十多大𩟠。程志書笑着向他搖手道··救人固然是人類應盡的義務，可是下井救人，結果是自已也落在井裏，這事我不贊成。你有這個意思，那就很好，不必送他們了。要不然，這一星期，差着一半的糧食，到那裏去找呢？説着，就向李士廉笑道··這話我不説明白，李先生不會懂。原來西安的學生，都是十二分刻苦的。你看他身上這一套衣服差不多終年都是這個樣子。上海和北平的學生，大槪睡鐵床是很平常，可是他們都是睡土坑。尤其是吃，你會想不到。説着，用手指了桌上那黑　道··這東西是鄉下的，不是長安城裏的。假使學生的家，離城不過三五十里路的話，他們就是星期六下午走回家，星期日下午再回城，此行不爲别的什麽，就是爲着回去拿這東西。𩟠是不値錢，可是要論到這𩟠怎樣拿到長安城裏來的，那就大可研究了。因爲這一點，所以王君要送𩟠給胡嫂子，我不贊成。况且他每個星期七斤𩟠，也不過剛剛的够吃。若是分一半給人，還有一半𩟠，到那裏去取償。（一○九）</p>
<h3>神戲</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>在農村破産聲中，忽然聽得神戲二字，豈不是一件矛盾的奇事麽？前星期吾們嘉定西北鄉，呌「老渚匯」地方，竟大做其神戲；據説：這一宗演劇的費用，是借著廟裏菩薩的牌子，去一家一家化的願錢；而且這一回的江湖戲班，名田記大舞台，脚色來得齊整，行頭也不錯，所以引得各鄉到的看客，格外來得衆多；不過做了四本的戲，方方一帶的田畝，像豆呀，麥呀，不曉得要踏損了多少，但是一班鄉民口中，還説著今年做了幾天的戲，敬敬菩薩，明年必定要豐年，有十足的收成哩！這不知是什麽話！</p>
<p>哦！不要怪鄉下地方，農民沒有智識，要做神戲，現在就是在城市的人們，也十分高興，要看戲，祗得借託火神菩薩的權威，只消有一個出頭的資格，馬上拿了黃簿面子册子，説了幾句敬神的話，自然而然會摸出錢來；並且還有戲看，那一個不情願呢！於是小小的一所火神廟，閙了幾乎墻坍壁倒壓死人命的事件來，又因戲班裏不敷開銷，敬神以外，到了夜間搬往邑廟裏，售劵賣戲，雖是塲所略大，也擠得水洩不通；尤其是搭看檯的，布置得全無隙地，但坐客過多，時時有坍臺的聲浪，甚至有壓傷脚骨，因而受傷的，你想可憐不可憐呢！</p>
<p>最可笑的，省了錢，不坐看臺，站在廣塲上，呌「軋臺前」，這種人是很有氣力，雖有時像潮湧，他還能掙扎着把兩脚立住，沒有氣力的，就要被人家擠倒，甚而立脚不牢，鞋子脱落，拾起來丢入戲台上，堆得高高，故待到戲完結，臨時動身，往往有不穿鞋子的人，以襪踏地，表示著我是看戲回來的，或者只得向，鞋子店裏，買了新的穿上再走，唉！不要笑鄉下的農民，其實城裏照戲塲上看，阿公去笑啥阿婆呢！</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （涂紅霞）</p>
<p>三國志金聖嘆曰：「十八路諸侯不能殺董卓，而一貂蟬足以殺之；劉關張三人不能勝吕布，而貂蟬一女子能勝之；以袵席爲戰塲，以脂粉爲甲胃，以盼睞爲戈矛，以嚬笑爲弓矢，以甘言媚詞，爲運奇設伏，女將軍眞可畏哉！」自古美人壓制英雄，英雄屈服美人，豈至近代而然哉！</p>
<h3>鐵啞鈴</h3>
<p>— 胡沉舟</p>
<p>在求學時代，從來不曾愛過「體育」這門功課。一溜出了學堂，生活壓迫着你竟天彎着脊骨，在墨水瓶跟筆桿兒中間過，更沒有挪挪手，踢踢腿的機會。於是，人越加廋，越加失了勁。碰着了挺胸凸肚的人，就禁不住打噤，腦袋自然而然地在他前面低下去了。</p>
<p>年紀不過二十，便那麽不行；這無論如何講不通，在個人主義發展到它的頂點的現社會裏，人跟人的衝突將一定免不了。弱者將被强者壓在屁股下面當凳子坐，不能低低地哼一聲！何况公理是建築在鐵跟血的基石上的！别人黷武地拿着也殺過來，究竟不可以筆迎敵，説：「來，我跟你講理！」</p>
<p>練「武」的傢伙可眞不少：「十八般」，仙人擔，石鎖，······好像咱們常在馬路上瞧見那些英雄們耀武揚威地使着的；還有外國的拳師的Ｃhest　Expander，沙袋之類，但是總覺得那些練起來不在方便，而且容易受傷，在無意中聽到人提起鐵啞鈴。啞鈴操從前在學校裏有過，雖然那當兒是木頭的；現在增加一點重量罷了。</p>
<p>終於買了一對每支凈重十二磅的鐵啞鈴天天大清早，當太陽還沒有起來時離開牀，不管敝窩（愚窩）受着冬天的影響，它的温度是多麽低；一套短衫褲把窗兒，門兒統統打開了！西北風在敝窩裏完成它的交流作用。前面是那個綱球塲：現成的新鮮的空氣！（應該感謝它的主子丨那邊兒大洋房裏的紳士老爺呵）從朦朧的記憶裏，揀出啞鈴的操法，那麽零碎地，不完全地··「上，下，左，右，前，後！」</p>
<p>開頭，感覺那兩支黑東西怪重的，使了幾下，臂兒立刻發酸，支持不了。現在胳膊一天天地粗起來了！那付鐵啞鈴的身體上也已刻着不少的白疤。</p>
<h3>殺岀一条生路</h3>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>爲着要表顯他自已確有這樣的資格起見，便不能不用射獵來做一種證明，因此，他見了無論怎樣凶猛的老虎或豹子，都不能有半些畏縮的表示，否則那些隨同他行獵的人，便不免要私相竊笑了。這還祇是他的胆氣的試騐，並不足以表顯他的弓馬的精熟要試騐他的弓馬，鼬鼠便是一種最適宜的試騐品，因爲鼬鼠雖然很弱小，但它們的足力極强，跑起來比什麽東西都來，而且它的身子非常靈活，除非精於箭術的人，休想射得到它。如其有一個皇帝往往能够獵到鼬鼠，他的善射的聲名，必不難爲全國人所稱道了！至於那劍的運用却又不同了，尋常總是備而不用的，只有那些胆力委實極高，武藝實委極精的領袖，爲着要使他的人民誠心誠意的畏服他，才故意放棄了弓箭不用，特地馳馬過去，和一頭猛虎或一頭豹决戰於五步之内，盡量的顯出他的劍術來，不過這種情形，畢竟是很少的！」</p>
<p>太后上面的幾節話，祇給我們説明了帝皇們行獵的大槪情形，和他們所以時常要行獵的原因；至於怎樣才算演完一次行獵的詳細節目，伊還沒有説到。我們不由都透着很焦急的神氣，於是伊就説到正文上來了。（二一九）</p>
<h3>重修周濂溪先生墓</h3>
<p>— （冠吾）</p>
<p>宋儒周敦頥先生，字茂叔，世家道州營道縣濂溪上，嘗著太極圖説通書等數十篇，合形上形下之學，一以貫之，伊川明道兩先生均出門下，實爲道學之宗。先生生於宋眞宗天禧元年，卒於神宗熙寗六年，年五十七，葬於江西廬山蓮峯下坵墓年久失修，九江縣鮑縣長任公爲昭揚先賢保存古蹟起見，發起修葺，雖有提倡贊助者，終無成議。聞此次紅卍字會賬濟隊赴贛救濟，適爲濂溪先生後裔周宗良會長督隊，鮑縣長偶與談及，極爲感動，周君慨允獨任復修，約計四千元，鮑縣長已規畫具體辦法，尅日興修，並擬於墓前修路，以通馬路。從此九江又增一我勝，亦佳話也。</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>滬粵觀光機遇霧紀</h3>
<p>— 錢華</p>
<p>中國航空公司新近從美國購到最新式道格拉斯水上飛機二架，每架値美金六萬元，合國弊二十萬元左右，分别命名廣東福建，專事飛航滬粤綫，保障乘客的安全。原定本年一月一日，試飛新機，並邀請本市中西報界乘坐，沿綫觀光遊覧。不料臨時以天氣不佳改期到三日，三日天公依然不做美，於是延到六日早晨七時方始成行，那天早上六點鐘，我在晨光熹微中，乘車向龍華飛機塲出發，六時半到機塲，已有許多人在乘客室等候。公司營業副主任何志競先生親爲招待，並介紹與公司總理戴恩基先生晤見，戴先生又轉介紹同行的各位記者；申時電訊社的王皎我君，字林西報的羅茜女士，泰唔士報的鮑爾孟登先生，和大美晩報的高爾德先生，連戴先生和我一共六人。於是乘客和行李一一過磅，紀錄在一張飛機載重單上。最後飛機師房斯在載重單上細閲一過，道聲ＯＫ，就開始出發。公司裏職員連忙每人分贈小紙包一個，裏面有紅十字會藥棉一站塊，和留蘭香糖一包，虊棉是塞耳的，預防機聲震動過甚，可以試用一下。</p>
<p>水上飛機，泊在水面的，我們從碼頭上先後登福建機，乘客坐位是三人一排，分左右兩排，羅茜小姐走在最先，就與高爾德先生同坐在第一排，鮑爾孟登和戴先生坐第二排，我和王先生坐在最後。七時正，機師扭動發動機，飛機便向水面缓缓行駛，愈行愈速，水浪也愈激愈高，最後乘客兩旁的玻窗，差不多都沒在水裏了，就在這一刹那時間，機離水面飛昇，扶搖直上，俯瞰浦江和龍華附近屋字，歷歷在目，心中眞是愉快萬分。</p>
<p>我們這一小小的團體中，美籍飛機師房斯好像是總司令，操着一機的生殺權。旁邊的那位無綫電收發員陳君，好像牒報處長，隨時和外面溝通消息，報告内部。這位戴先生好像一位大學敎授，時時講解所經過的地點，和外面的消息。而我們一行記者，眞如在講堂上的學生一般，把敎授的口講，迅速地筆記下來。這裏是杭州灣，這是海岸綫，這就是舟山羣島，這是中象島，這是寗波入口的鎭海，把地圖攤着做參考，而窗口下面的景地，是我們很確切的實騐塲。</p>
<p>高爾德君最健談，語又幽默，滿室充飽了笑的成份。我和王君却是燕京的舊同學，暢談前事，更覺得有興趣。戴先生東西張羅，在後面放行李的地方拿出幾條絨毯來，請我們蓋着下身，本來脚腿微覺寒冷，有了絨毯，眞是得其所哉。戴先生又拿出沙利文的夾饀麺包來，狼呑虎嚥的大吃一陣，可謂旣暖且飽。坐在飛機裏面，本不覺其快，行了一個小時，機師報告却已走了一百五十五英里，合四百六十五華里，眞出意料。（未完）</p>
<p>誌謝　羅谿張枕綠，匪特以文辭問世，其草書，並爲識者所賞，茲張君爲結墨綠、特例應求，凡五尺内書件，如聯（每副）屛區額横直幅等，每件悉祇取費二元，贈送宣紙墨費及外埠郵資，此例以廢曆年内直接總承辦處北京路浙江路口良晨好友社爲限，餘如原潤，昨承惠貽立幅一件，特此誌謝。</p>

<h3>紗市暗澹無神</h3>
<p>紗市依然疲弱、人氣異常散澹、但印棉漲勢猛鋭、本埠未受若何影響、良以現紗銷路清淡、各帮皆以銀根緊迫、進胃殊呆、故外棉雖漲、仍難引起興奮氣象、惟通成公司對於本月份無意收貨云、</p>
<h3>標紗難振</h3>
<p>標紗晨初在未開盤前、因外棉狂漲、都料其有數角漲力、但頭盤拍出、近月漲一·二角、速平定、塲中人氣仍難振作、拍至二·三盤、聞現紗銷路不多、且棉市回落、結果近跌二角、中月漲一·三角、午後聞本月份在一百八十五元間、通成公司無意收進、將多頭逐步了結、惟日商抵進、抛出遠月以爲掉期、故市面無大上落也、結果各月又跌三·四·五角、查賣出吉豐三百五十包、賡豐一千一百五十包、通記二百包、均昶六百包、達記九百五十包、泰昌二百包、買進梅記八百五十包、長豐六百包、錦昌五百五十包、源大五百包、信誠一千包、茲將一日間最高低價及收盤照價列下、</p>

<h3>棉市傾向於抛賣</h3>
<p>棉市亦無精彩、形勢頗現虚弱之狀、蓋因銀根依然趨緊、産地之價有不穏消息、故多數心理傾向抛賣、惟印棉翁默拉一種飛漲七羅比半、然上海市價毫無影響、可見人心之呆木不振矣、</p>
<h3>標花晨漲午回</h3>
<p>標花前市開盤尙昂、因印度棉突然狂漲五·七·王</p>
<p>羅比、查其趨漲原因、謂存貨薄弱、各方來源凋疲、引起軋空而飛漲、然本埠市氣未能激震、因金融仍緊、紗市軟化、執貨者受銀根影響、願意鬆價脱售、再則上海華棉目前存有五十萬擔之巨、而金價微跌、所以人心未能向榮、各月微漲五分、午後聞印棉稍有加回落消息、市氣渙散、各月均跌五分至一角、查賣出大孚七百擔、均昶一千擔、仁豐二千四百擔、源興昌七百擔、昶記六百擔、長豐二千二百擔、買進源大一千擔、大豐八百擔、益昶七百擔、長和七百擔、森康一千八百擔、信誠二千擔、茲將一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>美棉回跌四五磅音</h3>
<p>多頭了結···南方賣出</p>
<p>昨美棉市况疲軟而不活潑、上日報告、雖有政府不再抛售及囤棉處流入减少、此間未有影　響、開盤時因利物浦消息良好、各月漲一至三磅音、其後多頭了結、南方賣出、及現貨商因需要呆滯而抛售、漸形反動、現棉需要微有進步、紡織市况沈寂、收盤時市勢平疲、計現貨跌五磅音、期貨跌三至九磅音、英棉市况平定、計現貨跌一點、期貨漲一二點、印棉期貨商買進日商賣出、計平果爾漲四·七五羅比、奥姆辣漲七·五羅比、白羅溪漲五羅比、原電錄左、（九日電）</p>

<p>又據孟買電、十日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲二百四十二比羅、較上日收盤跌二羅比七角半、</p>
<p>又據新豐洋行報告云、棉花僵局仍未展開、農民與政府之棉花仍不放出、同時下屆之植棉預備已在進行中、多頭之不耐者漸有了結、最高法院判决發表前立法之朦朧、與彭克海案未將産額規定等事、致交易範圍殊難擴展、聞肥料與農具有大宗成交云、</p>
<h3>糧食期粉套賣之風漸息</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市而、呈先疲繼定之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小一二三角左右、坎拿大小八分至一角六分不等、當開價時、以洋麥報跌、兼之前日洋麥定成一船、各月份人心、均見軟弱、較之前日小去一分至一分半不等、惟廠套無幾、客帮去胃、尙不寂寞、故跌度亦無幾也、迨至下午開盤、以各廠未出、套貨者亦袖手觀望、交易旣清、市氣亦見回穏、至大批交易、以舊歷結賬已近、客帮交易、多數停乎、故後步看盤旋之局也、結果本月份未動、二月份微小二釐半、三月份小七釐半、四月份小二釐半、五月份小二釐半、六月份小半分、</p>
<h3>期麥停滯而帶疲勢</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平寂之態、以洋麥報價、回小八分至一二三角不等、開價時各月份市氣、均見停滯、各盤交易、亦見清淡、價較前日、小去二三分不等、迫至下午開盤、市面仍見軟弱、因市塲略有洋麥套頭、故人心均呈軟檔、遠期之步小、當爲此故也、結果本月份小三分、二月份跌五分、三月份小四分、四月份小五分、現麥市面、以標凖見疲、中次貨喊落一二分、開山東宿州歸德麥四元零三四分、瑤灣麥三元九角五六分、六含麥四元零一分、次九角八分、計五千包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥　現貨情形平穏、廠家與遠東購進、阿根廷與澳洲小麥之行將運銷、與加麥存底之充足、皆將影響於未來之價格、美國小麥並不缺乏、惟將使剩餘减少耳、</p>

<h3>期洋米囤户出籠</h3>
<p>人心虚軟······各檔續疲</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况更爲疲軟、新到伊哩才培司馬拉號一船、（此係十一月份裝船、乃係十一月份最後一船、十二月份尙有二船未到、大約日上亦可抵申）、市上存底充實、到頭不絶、銷化雖活、人心甚虚、昨開出現洋米四千多包、價又續小五分至一角不一、期洋米洋商求售不絶、行囤心虚、求脱尤力、進户觀望、市上只開敏黨西貢等四月份三百噸、價爲四元八角半、惟暗盤則有二三千噸成交、價比市上售開爲低、因此客囤方面更爲恐慌求脱、但新交易昨已停頓、如市上浮存一空、市面反又站定也、客秈到存兩少、行販尙不肯十分輕脱、昨日開二千多包、市價被洋米影響、亦帶小五六分云、</p>
<h3>天氣晴明河下米又跌二三角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帶來源三十餘號、（貨共近六千石）、市况自昨市一度轉跌後、昨則開手續有餘波、兼之大時晴正、人心更軟、致銷塲奋滯、市色頻頻下游、計跌有三角之譜、如各晚稻及厚粳等價、俱見貶落二三角不等、視大局形勢、一種奄奄不振之氣、後市或再有萎疲之慮、杜洋尖因數朝乏貨、市見挺秀、然陰變元隨粳市率下一二角不等、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地到貨四十餘號、市銷方面、白粳及各尖早薄稻等均形滯細、惟攣元略交、統市銷貨約計千餘石、市價白粳高料小數角、中次角外、變元小一角、羊尖疲數分、薄稻跌一二角、餘貨均屬疲格、</p>
<h3>黃豆銷路轉懈怠</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、因皖捐省府雖不免、但上峯已派監督限日撤免、故一部份人心虚怯而先跌、且近兩日各路銷塲懈怠、又値長江豆衆多、且在銀根緊急之下、受種種原因、故市轉跌四五分矣、昨計成交漢口乍豆一千五百包、價自三元六角三至五角、漢遲豆二百包、價爲三元四角二、大連四平街豆二車、價開四元零五分、頴州陳豆一車、價爲三元八角、歸德豆五百包、價爲三元七角半、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白漲起一角</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、趨勢仍緊、公會划盤、二四粗砂白普通現貨前日呌十八元九角半、未成者、昨已划出十九元、轉口貨五元四角、比前均升一角、八九號荷赤現貨十三元九角、轉口關棧貨四元八角、太古煻Ｂ嘜十九元三角、本廠綿白一號十八元二角、貨缺、號盤有潮帮開出新到潮青一千餘包、提莊青爲十一元、黃崗青爲十元六角至四角、半南青十元二三角、隆港青十元至九元九角、比前又升二角、廣帮開出長安片青數十簍、九元八角、建帮開出泉州青百數件、九元七角、</p>
<h3>南北貨碼生晒圓肉軋缺</h3>
<p>石碼生晒圓肉、近以地價轉升、來源寥寥、聞號貨早已開通、行存亦屬有限、故現在甚感軋缺、查號盤普通曾到五十四元、如有色光紅亮身份乾燥而片大之貨到來、開價尙可加漲、大約後可有小哮數運下、以應銷方需要、</p>
<h3>五金馬口鐵漲價一元餘</h3>
<p>馬口鐵市面、近頗良佳、雖交易在歲尾年暮之期、不見增加、但定價步俏、來貨涸少、所以行情一節、異常挺硬、現市行盤、開出如下、（單位元）</p>

<p>比之上日如單連好起五六角、雙連好起一元一二角不等、交易除零星門莊有開出外、大宗生意、則未聞有成交、據業中人云、海外定價逐日報漲、本埠銀根十分緊急、苟執貨者能擯持一二星期後、則此種行市定能開出矣、查昨市成交祗有二三百箱、</p>
<h3>絲茶　婺源珍眉歐銷略動</h3>
<p>婺源北路珍眉綠茶、去路疲滯、昨日錦隆水興等行、非洲已有來電需求、業已購進一百七十箱、抽蕊貨市盤做開一百十元、普通貨售盤自七十元至七十三元、較去年年底見低三四元、針眉秀眉綠茶、昨市英莊恊和杜德等行、亦均有進胃、惟售價亦因華商亟謀脱乎、依然有跌無漲云、</p>
<h3>油市　新柏油漢市缺俏</h3>
<p>柏油自漲風戢後、形勢漸見和平、惟今冬各處年令均不甚好、故本市來源稀極、若以往年而衡、則温台及江西等處新貨已絡繹有到、不料各産地均云貨少價高、以致台州温州兩處、迄今隻件無到、而江西油僅到近百餘件、故客貨幾將絶跡、年令若此、實所罕觀、行家先曾向宜昌辦過一批、價尙合算、但貨品略有參差耳、據連日漢市所報、市面尙屬堅固、亦因到貨不旺、銷塲雖無大宗、然零星尙不過弱、前日新貨頭盤開出重荆每砠十一兩八錢曹寳銀、照此價格、合到本埠、須在二十元光景、乃滬行現售無木重荆祗十九元五六角、已與成本不符、故市面後去極穏、惟銷路亦不比往年、因江浙兩省均爲旱災區域、燭銷亦清淡異常、眞所謂一分年令一分銷、</p>
<h3>疋頭大衣呢受天時影響</h3>
<p>大衣呢、目下爲旺令、奈走銷較之秋季反滯、刻母論五彩閃色、雙單面拷花點花、格子人字斜花等、趨勢均鬆疲、其最大原因、確受天時暖熱影響、按今歲天氣、忽晴和忽陰雨、不若往年隆冬深寒、致該類大衣呢、市銷轉鈍、中西裝厚呢大衣、顧客减少購買也、</p>

<h3>現代藝術上的强調與誇大</h3>
<p>— 禾金</p>
<p>三十年代的人們，經過了大戰後十年中的摸索，經過了一切都失掉了辦法的窒息；在突然地看到了一種新的學説，新的事物，出現的時候，他們底歡喜眞是無可言喻的。就是這一種狂歡的力量，迷失了他們的理解力，呌他們不顧一切地去追求光明；於是，當一旦社會的制度以突變的姿態而呈現了異常迅速的變革的時候，他們所受的刺激簡直是無可形容的。一切秩序，道德，宗敎，在一個迅雷不及的「無辦法」的炸彈之下，都已炸成了碎片。而生活在這碎片中的人便也跟着失掉了一切，剩下來的就只有赤裸裸的原始性。</p>
<p>而同時，科學與工業却呈現了驚人的發達，所有一切足以産生新的刺激的東西，都應運而生了：摩天樓，飛機，高速率機車。速射艇······</p>
<p>在這種經濟不景氣與科學工業的猛進之矛盾的衝突中，三十年代的一部分人們，就必然地只有一條路能走；狂亂丨他們不斷地追求着新的刺激，以麻木目前的困苦，他們只需要動作，動作，動作，；毫無意義的原始性的動作。</p>
<p>這便形成了美國人所謂的「快速生活」（Ｆast　Life）。</p>
<p>這種傾向，表現在現代的藝術上的，便是强調（Strong　Tone）與誇大（Ｈypdrbole)。</p>
<p>由了上述的原因，三十年代的人們所神往的，不，再是細緻的工筆盡畫了，而是表現派的强調的速寫與木刻；不再是月下泛舟，徘徊低吟了，而是駭濤中的快艇的飛馳；也不再是音響幽絶了，而是振蕩數極高的嗓音的速奏。同時，爲了「快速生活」的掃蕩，人們再也沒有時間（不如説沒有那種心情來欣賞中世紀的工筆晝了，他們祇要求對於某種特徵用誇大的手法表現得特别明顯的漫畫（Carton)：他們再也不想去吟味新聞紙上的細緻的描寫文了，他們祗能看一二條提要的標題！</p>
<p>這種手法，表現在現代的藝術上的，在繪畫上則有畢卡索（Picasso)的繪畫，諾爾臺(E·Noide)的木刻，及常見的漫畫等；在音樂上則有施脱勞司（R·Straus)的交響曲；在文學上則有崇拜原始的赤裸裸的動作的海敏威(E·Hemingway)，福克納爾(W·Faulkner)的小説。與馬區(J·M·March)的詩。</p>
<p>如果還不至於否認用生活來解説藝術是可能的話，那末三十年代的藝術却正好代表了現代人們的生活：强調，誇大丨而這强調與誇大，也祇有在這瘋狂的三十年代才會爲人所接受的，祇要看戰前的沙龍丢棄畢卡索，戰前的人説司太因（G·Stein)</p>
<p>章除了她自已便沒有第二個人能懂得，而看一看戰後的三十年代呢：看人們盡力的摹仿畢卡索與司太因，就可以明白了。</p>
<p>而這强調與誇大，因此，非但並不是像一般所説的「眩奇」；而相反地，它們是眞實地代表了三十年代的「人間苦」的。</p>
<h3>某一次旅行</h3>
<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>我跟一大堆形形色色的沒人職業的人跑到佛山鎭······</p>
<p>和廣東人「打流」是一椿有濃厚趣味的玩意，牠超過凝固的安樂，庸俗的享福，霉腐的閒適，而是一種緊張的，混合着人類底同情的冒險。每個人都拿獵户那樣靈活，精明的眼睛注視着自已的目標，做出一切美麗的，空想的計劃；晚上，貪饒地賭錢，一直賭到天亮。日裏就豪爽地儘所有的錢拿來吃。一個陽江縣地主底兒子，預備在冥錠稽查所裏鑽個小小的差事，名字好像呌做顧耿之的脚色，當他曉得一點希望都沒有了的時候，就向我提議做一次旅行。</p>
<p>「吳大魁，你知道我們陽江縣出什麽頂出色的東西？不是皮箱皮枕，那都是假貨！是到處吃飯的人呵。那可眞了不起！」他這樣説了，就拍拍胸口，彷彿飽嗝打不出來的樣子。</p>
<p>他打開他那兩隻舊的中國式皮箱，拿起兩三個新糊好的裝璜盒子，那是裝一打藥瓶，或者更多的數目的。一面指着箱子給我看。幾千幾百每個二三寸高的細玻璃小瓶子，裏面都滿盛着黑色油質的假藥，七零八亂地像兩箱被翻散了的大子彈：一面就對我誇耀他自已：</p>
<p>「有備無患，就是這個東西！你别看輕牠，以爲不過是一些假藥油丨其實藥那里有眞的呢？」他對我親暱地笑了笑，繼續説，「憑了牠，我就可以跑到隨便什麽我要去的地方去，多數的時候是不大有什麽爲難的。而且，而且丨」</p>
<h3>辨字與辨詞（一）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>客丨啊，現在的青年，國文程度眞是一代不如一代，越來越壞了！</p>
<p>主丨呣，幾天不見，你也變成人心不古派了罷！「人心不古」眞是一句古老的話，一萬年前最古的埃及銘刻裏就有這麽一句。當你提着書包在學校裏唸書的時候，那些摸鬍子的老前輩早就説：「國文程度眞是一代不如一代了」；而現在輪到你來説。</p>
<p>客丨老哥，我不來和你强辯。我剛才在你的書桌上翻看那些學生的課卷，有的把「分岐」寫成「分岐」，「生熟」寫成「生孰」，「蹤跡」寫成「從跡」，「著明」寫成「箸明」；有的把「九仭」寫成「九軔」，「兩造」寫成「兩曹」，「茫茫」寫成「芒芒」，「歌頌」寫成「歌訟」；這樣别字連篇，那是我們從來所沒見過的，這不是青年的國文程度退化了嗎？</p>
<p>主丨哈，哈，哈，······</p>
<p>客丨笑什麽？笑什麽？難道我説錯了嗎？</p>
<p>主丨我想起一件故事來，和你所説的頗有點相像，不覺笑起來了。清乾隆年間，有兩位主考，一姓莊，一鞠，莊某　頇，鞠某胡塗。有人集杜句嘲之云云一莊。夢未知何日醒，鞠花從此不須開。」鞠某試畢回京，對陳句山太僕發牢騷道：「杭州人員欠通，如何鞠可通菊？」陳太僕默然不答。鞠某再問他，陳太僕道：「我正在這兒想禮記月令那句「鞠有黃華」呢！「鞠某不覺大慚。（見兩般秋雨庵隨筆）現在請老兄不要臉紅，待我一一來翻給你看。這見是説文，你看「岐」字下的註解：「岐山，山有兩岐。因以名焉。「「岐」是本字，後來俗别製「歧」以爲兩歧字。這兒是禮記，你看禮運篇：「腥其俎，孰其　。」説文：「孰，食飪。」俗作「熟」。你再看：「從跡」的「從」，是本字「蹝」却是俗字；「箸明」的「箸」，是本字，「著」却是俗字。你再看：「九仭」，孟子作「掘井九軔」；「曹」，説文，獄兩曹也。史記作兩遭。茫茫，在傅：「芒。芒禹跡」，商頌：：「洪水芒芒」。」皆作「芒芒」。楚辭：「耽不知其所蹠」，王註：「耽就逮也」。「耽芒」，俗作「渺茫」。「訟」説文：「訟，爭也，「曰歌訟」。頌，貌也。容，盛也。今「歌訟」作「歌頌」，「頌貌」作「容貌」，皆俗誤，老兄，這究竟誰讀别字？誰寫别字？</p>
<p>客丨喔！那還是我錯嗎？</p>
<p>這樣，在他底監督和指揮之下，我們丢開了同伴，不讓一個人曉得地，出發了。我們底目的地是高要縣，而我們底程途是四百里以上的並不平坦的山路和水路。他對所有的路徑都好像非常熟悉，越過金帽頂山和魁崗，一直到了三水司，我因爲害了肚洩，才一個人坐着渡船回頭，和他分開了。</p>
<p>在走路的時候，我們像蝸牛那樣緩慢。顧耿之讚美着一切他所看見的，似乎很愛好這樣的生活。有一晩，我們歇在一個小鄉村的斗姆廟裏，神堂造得非常簡陋，一點光都沒有，他對我暢快地说：</p>
<p>「而且，一個人不能够顧得人家好，又顧得自已好。這裏面必定有什麽東西梗在那里，大家都一樣蠢笨，拿不出法子來。你想不是這樣麽？所以如果你要咬誰，千祈不要光光做出想咬的模樣，那一定會呌别人擎起木棍打個半死。咬下去，還要咬得深，一直刺進骨頭！給你咬的那個就會曉得他不應該嚷出來，還要裝成平安無事的樣子了！」</p>
<p>給他證明這些話的，是那些喜歡買藥的女人。她們中間有一個買了一瓶藥油，揭開來用手指塗了點在太陽穴，馬上就對其餘的女人和站在旁邊閒看着的農民們恭頌起藥油底奇特的功效來。</p>
<p>「這是中國人底好品行，大徒弟，我們走吧。」</p>
<p>顧耿之一面收拾藥箱，一面對我説。於是由我挑起那些行李，一路唱粵曲，向每個人説感謝的話，跨進别個鄉村去·····</p>
<p>人，有時候要這樣生活的。</p>
<h3>寂寥時</h3>
<p>— 馬星野</p>
<p>接上一個多月的陰雨，天是那樣的低，南京成爲一個鍋子，我在鍋子中的冷水上浮着。近來漸漸感到不可救濟的凄凉之感，星期日也沒有什麽朋友來，要自已去找朋友，則南京對於我是一個冰塊，我不會也不願在冰塊上鎖着。緊閉着房門過着一個星期日，下午三點鐘便把電燈開上，房子裏面同房子外面一樣的是寂寥。電燈向剛才收拾乾凈的寫字桌上放着淡的華光。</p>
<p>半年來情緖不大好，你滿懷希望着的是親熱，當你遇到親熱，馬上變成吵閙煩燥；滿懷也希望着清靜，當這有清靜的時候，清靜馬上變成凄凉寂寞。吵閙與寂寞都是十分難於應付。神經漸漸地衰弱下去，與其在吵閙中掙着支持着，倒不如鎖在寂寞裏，凍結在凄凉裏。把羅素的（Ｃonquest　of　Happiness拿起來，眼力老是向匹周放散，而看不下去，於是把食指壓在右腮，閉着眼裝着睡覺。窗外濛濛的還是下着雨。</p>
<p>記得這上顆跟隨着我二十餘年的心，被帶着黏性的灰淡的「寂寥」包罩着，已經不是一次了。然而近來覺得這黏性的灰淡色的薄膜，更其使我注意到。在去年，當大學放了暑假而我仍舊在異國進暑期學校時，同暑校結束，連一些老太婆老先生都離開大學鎭的時候，我也曾發現心靈被寂寥封鎖着。然而你可以到網球塲上和房東的晨小孩子，丢丢皮球，可以坐在門前的搖動椅上，看對面屋子烟囱的夕烟一縷縷的上去，你可以等待着送報童子，把捲好的晩報丢到你椅前，更可以拿出鉛筆來猜十字謎。這此事情，現在都不能做，而去做也是太孩了氣，離孩子時代已經太遠了。</p>
<p>火爐中的火雖然不很大，然我不高興我的火爐還有别的原因，這個火爐不能敎人好好玩着火。如果是開口的壁爐，如果燒的是木塊，我可以用火箸搔着燒紅了的木塊，使黃金色的火星繼續不斷的进出來，爐火可以使人面得到暫時的温暖紅潤，因爲玩着火，也不怕靠得太近，身上弄得太熱。笛卡兒在火爐前運用他沈思默想而悟到造化無常的道理，我决不願像他一樣用腦子，我只要使小小的火星解我的寂寞。</p>
<p>如果這個火爐是一個紅泥做的，燒着木炭的。也要比較有意趣。木炭會燒得逼逼迫迫的響，有時會猛地一炸，嚇人一跳，倒可以打破這太凝結了的沉寂。而且我可以煮一些茶。從杭州來的朋友，最近送我一罐好茶葉。然而得用自來水，你决不能在南京城裏弄到什麽好泉水的。我不喝酒，當然不能煮酒來自慰寂寞。便是燒茶，像這樣笨頭蠢腦的火爐，那裏會燒出好茶來。</p>
<p>漸漸是黃昏時候。寂寥更化爲沉重。報販把申報送到，擦得乾淨的地板上印着幾個帶泥的足跡。</p>
<h3>微笑（一）</h3>
<p>— 英國Lawrence著唐錫如譯</p>
<p>當他到達奥斐麗亞選了來退隠的「藍姊妹」修道院時，又是夜裏了，他給引進這座華屋的修道院長的房裏，她默默的站了起來，向他鞠躬，垂下了眼睛看他。然後她用法語説：</p>
<p>「我很痛苦來告訴你，她在今天下午死了。」</p>
<p>他呆了，不過並沒有感覺到多大的苦痛，祗是用他的漂亮的，堅冷的，和尙一般的臉孔，向着空虚呆視着。</p>
<p>修道院長輕輕地把她的柔白的美麗的手，被在他的臂膊上，倚近他，抬起頭凝視着他的臉孔。</p>
<p>「勇敢些」！她輕輕地説，「勇敢些，不能嗎？」</p>
<p>他退後幾步，當一個女人這樣倚近他的時候，他是永遠驚怖的。這個修道院長，雖則穿上那肥大的裙裾，她仍是十分女性的。</p>
<p>「我是十分勇敢的！」他用英語回答，「我可以看她嗎？」</p>
<p>修道院長拉了一下鈴，一個年青的尼姑跑了出來。她的臉色很蒼白，不過在她的棕色的眼睛裏，有種天眞的和惡作劇的東西，這個年老的女人喃喃的作了一個介紹，這個年青女人端嚴的向他微微地行了一個禮。可是馬太伸出了他的手，像是一個男子達到了他的一絲最後的希望似的。那個年青的尼姑把她袖着的柔白的手，脱出來，把一隻手怕羞地滑進他的手裏，完全像是一隻睡着了的小鳥那麽默順。</p>
<p>他從他的憂鬱的不可測的陰處爬出來，他想：「一隻多麽美麗的手啊！」</p>
<p>他們沿着一條美麗的可是冷靜的長廊的走去，在一扇門上彈着，馬太，像是在霧裏一般走着，不過仍舊覺得到這二個女人黑裙的，好看的肥大，在他面前帶了柔和的，綷縩的忽忙動着。</p>
<p>當那扇門拉開來的時候，他嚇呆了。他看到在這間高的，華貴的房間裏面，許多支臘爛繞着這張白色的床燃着。一個尼姑坐在臘燭的旁邊，當她把頭從祈禱書上抬起來看時，她的白頭巾下面的臉孔是陰暗的，簡單的，然後她站了起來，是一個壯健的婦人，她向他微微地鞠躬了一下，馬太看到她的一雙微黑的乳白的手，放在她的華麗的藍緞子的胸前在捻轉一串念珠。</p>
<p>這三個尼姑，靜靜地聚在一起。可是她們走到床頭去的時候，她們的絲質的黑裙的襇裱，仍舊是綷縩的，女性的。修道院長俯了下去，用種最優美的動作，把死尸面上的白麻布的面巾揭了起來。</p>
<p>馬太看到他妻子臉上的死去的和美麗的謐靜了，突然，在他心的深處，有種像是笑的情緒在那兒跳動着，他喉頭稍微響了一下，一種異乎尋常的微笑，跑到他的臉上來了。</p>
<p>這三個尼姑，在那搖顫得又快又温暖得像一棵聖誕樹的燭光裏，在她們的頭巾下面，一逕是露出一種十二分同情的眼光看好他的，她們像是一面鏡子，六隻眼睛突然帶了一種恐懼驚奇了，接着是變了，迷惑了，變成了奇怪的神情，在這三個尼姑的臉上，本來是一逕在燭光裏一籌莫展地朝好他的，現在却有一種奇怪的，不自禁的微笑，開始在沁了出來，在這三副臉孔上，那仝樣的微笑，笑得竟是那麽不同，就像三朶精緻的花那麽開着，在這蒼白的年青尼姑臉上，這個微笑幾乎是苦痛的，帶了種惡作劇的陶醉意味的，不過在這個看守死屍的尼姑，那個成熟的，生着平直眉毛的微黑的立葛林女人的臉上，却現出一種異敎的微笑，遲緩的，在牠的頽廢的詼諧意義上，是含了種無限的狡猾的，這是依特魯利亞人的微笑：狡猾的，不羞澁的，不能解答的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>趙欣伯槍斃　無法</h3>
<p>該死的趙欣伯，現在竟被日人槍斃了。趙欣伯不死於我國國法之下，而死於日本軍閥之手，殊爲遺憾。但更端言之，趙欣伯不死於我國國法之下，而死於日本軍閥之手，該死尤其該死。</p>
<p>據八日本報瀋陽通訊，「著名漢奸趙欣伯，於日本調查憲政歸來，菱刈藉邀宴爲由，約趙到後，當卽將其槍决，」聞其致死原因，共有四點，而四點之一，卽爲一趙誤以僞組織爲眞正國家，因而對僞機關中之滿人，如事事趨承日人時，則當面呵斥之，困而僞滿人亦嫌恨之。」趙之該死，卽在於此，日人之組織僞滿，原是爲欺騙世界的一種工具，舞弄滿人的一套把戲，故其一切政權，全在於日人的掌握，而一般漢奸誤認爲日人對於僞滿有特殊的好感，彈冠相慶，面有喜色，往往以效忠清室，復興滿清爲已任，眞是做天下之大夢。</p>
<p>一般漢奸現在尙在夢中的，亦頗不乏其人。據聞僞國務總理鄭孝胥輩，亦抱此種觀念，現在雖受日人的支配，他日亦欲組織眞正僞滿國家，我看這種念頭，還是打銷爲妙。趙欣伯是一個榜樣，還是貼貼服服，爽爽快快，直接去效忠日人吧，去做日本的順民吧，不要再睡在鼓裏，做復興滿清的好夢。</p>
<p>趙欣伯槍斃後，一般僞組織中人，凡依附趙氏爲靠山的，均垂頭喪氣，狀極可憐。其實這類蝦兵蟹將，原是可憐而不足惜。趙欣伯爲漢奸中巨頭之一，尙看不出風頭，欲以組織眞正僞滿國家自任，做了一塲春夢。而一般狐羣狗黨，更是卑不足道，但此時到是給他們一個覺悟的機會，以後可不再做此好夢。</p>
<p>至日人所公佈趙欣伯的死因，則誣趙與關内通訊，天然是無稽之談，所謂欲加之罪，何患無辭。無論趙氏現以復興滿清爲目的，决不願與關内通訊，卽使並不效忠清室，而身爲漢奸，大名早已鼎鼎，關内人决不願與彼往還。故趙氏之死，卽是殺狗給猴子看，是做漢奸的一個榜樣，我勸鄭孝胥輩，不要再做復興清室的夢了。</p>
<h3>秋收以後</h3>
<p>— 裏</p>
<p>天一亮，太陽的金光，漸漸地從那東方的山後，射照着這寂寞的山坡，秋天的凄凉的景色，就在這裏浮現着。</p>
<p>桂郎，他那蒼瘦疲倦的臉孔，在這早晨的日光下，是顯得格外的枯黃了，自從昨天到了現在，他已經跑了幾十里路了，他的腿，沉重的踏着那山坡的小路，一步步的望着城裏走去·</p>
<p>幾年來，桂郎租的那一千步田，每年的收穫，都可够他的家用和租金，可是今年，天早了，龔家鎭上四面的田園，都給太陽晒壞了，天一連的一個多月沒有下過雨，鎭前的大溪，乾涸得一點水也沒有了，桂郎的田，雖靠近在大溪的東隣，可是一樣的，田土都給晒得裂現着條條的　痕，稻苗都枯萎死了，這對他今年的秋收，是宣告絶望了，和着龔家鎭上的人，一樣的絶望了。</p>
<p>天，終於下着雨了，但它却帶來了秋的氣候。</p>
<p>本來就蒼瘦了的桂郎，到現在他是更加的蒼瘦和愁苦了，往年，在這一次秋收之後，除了還給地主的租之外，他還可以將就的過着這個殘冬，可是，今年擺現在他眼前的，都變了。</p>
<p>時間是在一天一天的過去了，地主已經一連的來催討三次了，明天，第四次的約期就要到來了。這在桂郎是感到更加的煩悶和惟急。爲了這第四次租期的迫近，桂郎自從這幾天，就四處奔走的去設法，可是，秋收在這龔家鎭上是人人絶望，還有誰能助誰呢？</p>
<p>幾天的奔走，得到的都是絶望，這使桂郎的心更加的焦急起來了。昨晩一整夜的沒有睡得着，頭已有點昏了，可是明天，第四次的約期就要到了，天一亮，他就頂着昏痛的頭腦，拖着疲倦無力的腿，走出了龔家鎭，踏上這上城去的山坡上的小路。</p>
<p>但是桂郎回來時掛着一副更悲愁的頽喪的臉，慢慢地，又踏到這死寂的山坡上的小路，他這時充滿着十二萬分的疲倦，脚步顯出更加的無力了，但他的心，那顆焦急的心，却在劇烈的跳躍着·</p>
<p>鎭上的大街，商店都亮起煤油燈了，桂郎這時才走進了鎭裏來，他自從早上到了現在，已跑了五十多里山路，肚子裏却還未吃過一點東西，腿，簡直是麻木去了，他這時在大街上，行幾步停一下的望着家裏走去。慢慢地，拐過了幾個灣，終於看到了他那馬上就要變成别人的財産了的那間破舊的瓦屋，他發痴似的望着那黑洞洞的鉛塊的天空在嘆着氣。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣啦？跑得這末累，會不會借到了一點呢？」</p>
<p>桂郎的老婆，看着桂郎的那個樣子，很焦急很很悲哀的問着。但是，桂郎他。却等閉着眼睛的搖着頭。</p>
<p>就在次日，第四次收租的人來了，可是桂郎，却是在晩的深夜，走進另一個世界去了。只有他的女人和兒子，在那裏帶駡的呼哭着。</p>
<h3>荒年憶舊</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>丨丨吃排飯丨丨</p>
<p>「吃排飯」，一方面是像上海人所説的「好白相來希呀」的事件，另一方面則是最悽慘的表露着人們的厄運。</p>
<p>這，我曾經目擊過一回，那是我很小的時候，年代己記不清楚了，只記得那年也遭旱，廣闊的鄉間，旱得連飲水都發生了問題。至於飽肚子的「吃飯」，當然是更沒有辦法解决了。於是就遍演着吃排飯這一幕悲喜劇。</p>
<p>事實是這麽串演着：不管是親戚朋友，平日都是面熟，要好。但到了這時候，一切都顧不着了，大家放下平日的面孔，鳩集起來陣隊似的，由一二位綫索較爲可靠的統領出去，秩序是非常的好，而且很敦睦親善。到了一家人家，就分散將他全家所有的可以飽肚子的東西搜索出來，煮熟着，大家很客氣的來分食，一直到吃得顆粒無餘爲止·然後再上第二家，依照原辦法，挨次的吃將下去。</p>
<p>荒災裏的人們的生命，就只有靠這樣維持。</p>
<p>名目是「吃排飯」，實際上並沒有多少飯可吃。據我所記憶，普通是喝粥，固爲荒災太甚，平日豪富之家，也變成了貧民，盡其所有，也只够大批人羣喝幾頓粥。有些則只能搜索得一些雜糧，就馬馬虎虎也當做是「吃排飯。」</p>
<p>在這裏，有幾種情形，是値得表彰出來。</p>
<p>第一，是孩子們的狂歡，他們原是被「天眞的神」統治着，不知道怎麽呌做「豐歲」，又怎麽呌做「荒年」，只要是人馬聚集起來，他們就狂歡忘形了，不管這「聚集裏」到底是「涙水」抑是「笑容」？當時我也就是這麽一個，看着東家的孩子，西家的孩子全都聚在一起吃喝着，本來肚子是餓的，也就不覺得了，一味的狂歡，儼然是上了「天堂」似的。</p>
<p>其次，一般婦人們却個個　扳着焦苦的面孔，全沒有平時那種嘮嘮叨叨的快活景像了，有的甚至眼角上老是掛着那麽兩行欲滴不滴的涙水，有的却的確在暗地哭泣。</p>
<p>至於漢子們呢，他們到底是大丈夫，雖無歡笑，但也眞沒有哭泣的，不過面孔比平日確是兩樣，嘴吧總是多長的，眉毛總是　的，最特别的一個標記，就是性子來得非常的躁，常常駡女人，常常打孩子，有時打得孩子痛哭不止，還恨不得孩子死去。他們也常三五個聚在一道，談着怎樣救災的辦法，但那都是廢話，不能見諸事實的。</p>
<p>那般平日是富翁的人，這時也跟着我們一樣兒吃喝，則更是又可惡又可憐了，食品是那麽的低劣，但要飽肚子，救生命，也只得放下「身份」，礽開先前的一套「腸胃」，慢慢的，不，是很快的來咽哽。否則他們的高貴的性命，到了這時候，也只和我們的一樣「估價」。</p>
<p>不過，這是五六月青黃不接的時候的事情，還記得七月過後，這塲面就收拾了，因爲那雖則是荒年，但比現在還是要荒得不那個些。</p>
<p>最近我接得家鄉的來信，説是現在鄉裏已開始「吃排飯」了，這可還有一個很長的時期呢，嗚呼，亞門！</p>
<h3>載歌載舞</h3>
<h3>懷鄉病</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>獨自在孤寂的生的旅程上飄流過　遠的日子，那孤寂寞便漸漸地由淡變濃了，而這些時間所經過的一切事物亦如印在許多地方上的足跡隨現隨滅一樣的消滅了。記憶上沒留下一個値得永遠不時遺忘的印象，感到什麽都有點空洞，人更像是踩在雲堆上邊般的無限渺茫。我自已想，這大約是爲了多活了一些年歲，童心的性靈被繁紛的世事推蝕無存，使一個人的思想變成非常虚渺，對任何多都缺少熱烈的興趣，特别是一種眞切的滋味。然而近來奇怪的是，一向不大想起的幾乎忘却了的家的念頭竟從新打心頭醖釀着。而家鄉一些爛熟的景緻都能引起我深沉的遐思，在無邊的遐思中同時有着一種説不出的親暱的感情，使我對於家長起沉重的懹思病來了。</p>
<p>離家有不少時候了，在這之間我完全作成一個好像眞是沒有了家的流浪者在各處流浪，家是從跨出了門便給我扔在腦後了。家中的人天天盼望我的音訊，一隔了太長，詢問的信便不停地飛來了。每一次的信中，都是滲透到慈祥的母親殷切的惦念和着一顆掛慮的母愛的心。可是對於此，往往是沒有絲微情感的掀動，心，好像是一窩靜止的死水。至多亦不過是淡淡的悄自一笑，便無蹝無影了。而如今，爲了無盡的風霜的磨折，外間的一切除了給予以各種冷漠之感和隔漠的悲哀以外，我始終不曾在這悠悠的人海裏撈得一點什麽心靈上的賜物。現在才深深地覺得家有着非常的親密味，家從靜止的死水似的的心窩煽起重重的波瀾來了。過去對於家那樣的疏　淡此刻連自已都莫明其所以然，而正因爲過去的格外的疏淡使如今格外的</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>着，但又　雜着一些輕烟般的恨惘和説不出的歉意。這歉意實在是由於内疚發出·成爲一種對於家人，尤其是慈祥的母親的罪狀。我有些反悔了，往　不該那末撇下了家，長長的日子不寄回一個音訊，使母親掛念的心永遠的在掛慮着，天天希望着，終於天天在失望的當中　過去，也許這長長的日子會因了這家園都减少的歡娛而現出更多的寂寞來呢！</p>
<p>想起了隔着無數重的山的那邊的家園，隔着無數重的海的那邊一顆在掛慮着萬千里外的兒子母親的愁思的心，我幾乎楞住了，心頭一陣難過眼涙差些兒吊了下來。久久不被涙水浸濕着的眼睛現在是常因家的牽引而不時浸濕着了。</p>
<p>家的一切都是温存地刻在記憶上的。</p>
<p>在家的時候，偶然染了一塲小恙，躺在床上，母親便成日裏忙着，管着冷熱管着藥，差不多旁的事都不去理了，一下子跑進來坐在床側上，用着手輕輕撫摸着我的額際，婉柔地問着：覺得好了一點沒有？跑了出去不一下回頭又來問着，要不要吃什麽東西。卽是不吃藥，只這樣熱切的慰撫亦可以呌病好了的。可是那時候對這些人間稀有母性的眞情愛絲毫不覺得可貴，反而會因爲母親的嚕囌不休而使起性子來。若是在外邊病了，怎樣呢？可不是一個人悄悄的裝在屋子裏，聽不見脚步聲也聽不見温柔的聲息。聽得到的就是獨自在呻吟着的呼吸聲。母親熱切的慰撫呢？是祗有打夢裏作着回憶的温習了。到了知道應當珍惜的現在，身子却被阻隔在無數重的山和海的異地裏了。家呀，什麽時候才能回去享受那樂園的歡愉，讓我投進母親的懷抱裏靜靜地聽那熱切的而又婉柔的慰撫的聲音，恢復我失樂園的荒蕪的心！</p>
<h3>南洋的冬天</h3>
<p>— 爾</p>
<p>在這冬天，雪花將飄的時候，南洋却正是最迫熱的天氣。我們在這北地，是愛烘着火爐，老喜歡蹲在屋子裏，避那寒冷的朔風，望到一些淡弱的太陽光，便愛迎着上去，早晩都是風急寒重，人們是這麽萎縮的。可是，在南國，在那赤道帶下生活着的人們恰好是整天沉在悶熱中，最怕那熱的太陽光。在房子裏，一天到晩要洗冷水澡；天將破曉，便須爬起來澆冷水，擦去身上的熱氣。只圍着一條浴巾，赤身流汗。在白天，街上是給迫熟的太陽光佔去，和北地一樣的，多是給冷風趕少了行人，</p>
<p>一年到底是迫熱的太陽，沒有風，也很少雨絲，農田常常是給晒得像荒地般，看去辨别不出那便是一下雨便要如春筍勃發的稻田呢！</p>
<p>冬天是沉迷的，一片炎熱，一片枯荒。人們是那麽沉悶的，坐在椰子樹下，躱在房子裏。</p>
<p>然而，一年四季都是迫冷中，一天之内，却也有像春秋的氣色的變化。當太陽西沉時，海風飄進了海岸綫内，在黃昏蒼茫中，四處飄着夏夜的凉風，把冷氣完全消散了。這時候，街上的行人，便有些像流水般滔滔擋着波濤滿街頓生春色。神飛色舞了。</p>
<p>去了浴巾，披上細軟柔薄的短衫褲，穿着拖鞋，一踏出店門，便是滿面凉爽，慢步而走，飄然迎風，頭髮衫褲，都拂拂飄動，眞是渾身舒快，像是剛從水池裏上來的，感到心情分外清快，望着前後左右飄飄輕逸而去的人們，會像有些幽逸離塵之意。可以消散了内心無限的煩惱。整天在店内迷悶着黃昏一來，便不自禁，心已飄在晩風動中，輕逸的盪漾着，使人覺得手脚都輕鬆欲飛，南洋的晚風呵，眞是特别富有葱籠的詩意！在南洋過了半年多的難堪的迷沉的生活，便多半籍着這輕飄醉人的晚風消麽過去。這北地冰冷的冬天，忍受着寒凍的人，不由不追懷着那遠隔河山的，正飄着温柔清快的晚風的南洋！而且，在面洋那時候，恰好就是而今的冬天。</p>
<p>夜越深沉，南洋的凉風會更飄得使人欲醉欲仙。當天快要亮的時候，海風雖然漸漸消失，東主的熱光將到，好像就温暖沉迷得多：但當清晨洗冷水澡後，有些像初秋時分的天色，淡白的天空，有些蕭索中，還是微拂曉風；温柔裏夾些凄清的秋意。雖沒有晚風時分那樣生動輕逸而醉人，却也還是特有風味，輕迷迷的，富含春的氣色。等到太陽剛浮上地平綫時，好像閃着充分的黃金色的春光。</p>
<p>有人稱南洋，一年到晚都是春天，確是不會過分。生活在這像整年是春天的南洋的人們，就大有醉迷迷温暖暖之慨；南洋的本地人，在這種醉迷温和的氣色下，生活是那麽簡單，沉閒。大多數是茅屋幾間，薄衣數變，婦女們滿口嚼着　葉檳榔，有些浪漫之態，像近于自然的生活。人們多半是今天有酒今天醉的，賺到一角過一角的生活，少有進取的雄心。此刻的冬天，南洋正是大像春天，南洋的人們，生活是過得更簡閒，舒快，温暖呢！然而，南洋的人們，又過於沉迷迷了，有些像老愛喝酒的醉夫吧！！！</p>

<h3>電影發達的簡史（五）</h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（五）明星崇拜的態度與宣傳能</p>
<p>這裏限於篇幅，還不能將電影事業發達的一切步驟，稍爲詳盡的加以叙述。再則自從「明星制度」勃興以來，這裏亦不能將每個明星，或凖明星的事蹟，一一記載下來。但是爲了要明瞭　電影事業的背景起見，我們對於一九一二年至一九一八年之間的，一個異常有意味的重要關鍵，不能不略爲陳述一下，將那時的幾個明星們有趣的事蹟，告訴告訴你們。</p>
<p>在我們要曉得那時的明星的事蹟之先，我們先，我們先可以説，觀衆們對於明星們的熊度，現在不相同的地方。當卜希門（Francis　X·Bushman)在鼎盛的時代，公司方面認爲他的已經娶妻生子的事實，是不可宣佈的卜希門是一個有婦之夫，並且有五個小孩子，但是公司和他訂立的合同上，確訂明這些事實，是無論如何，不可宣佈的。他那時在詩家谷愛森尼公司（Fssanay　Corpcration)裏工作，但是他的家屬，確祇可以留居在曼麗蘭的鄉間。有一天，他將他的家屬帶到了詩家谷。公司當局知道了，立即將卜希門呌了去，很嚴厲地訓斥了一番，幷且呌他立即將他的妻子兒女，送回曼麗蘭的鄉間去，免得他娶妻生子的消息洩露了出去。</p>
<p>卜希門這一下子，就處於進退維谷的地位了。他一方面旣不能違背合同的條件，和公司當局的命令，一方面又不能將自已的妻子，呼之即來，揮之即去。這樣一閙，果然消息不期然而然的傳出去了。一則卜希門和他和夫人之間，發生了意見，一則卜希門又和一位同事的女明星，皮佛莉斐英（Ｂeverly　Ｂayne)，發生了戀愛。這樣，卜希門和他的夫人，不能不恊議離婚了。卜希門和公司雙方，都知道難以再掩飾下去，於是就商量好了，將卜希門和他夫人離婚的新聞，和卜希門跟斐英結婚的消息，同時公佈果然，這兩個消息宣佈之後，卜希門就立即失去了明星的地位了。因爲一個明星，已經有了老婆並且已經生了五個孩子，是一件多不够羅曼諦克的味兒呀，還有誰來崇拜他呢？</p>
<p>公因方面，固然不願意多年培養成功的一個大明星，一朝無形消滅。因此，他們就派遣了一個調查員，到全國各地去實地調查一下。結果，他從各處調查了回來了。他跑到卜希門的化妝室裏。他進去了，一言不發地將兩隻手捧住頭。卜希門一看情形不對，就問道：「眞的不興了嗎？」那調查員道：「豈但不興，你簡直是完結了。他的明星生活，果然就此完結了。他過了幾年，才在「賓漢」一張片子裏，重露了一露臉，但是他已往的光榮，已經消失了，他已經不能再聽到幸運之神來第二次敲他的門了。</p>
<p>以上所説的，不過是一個例。要是我們將從前的舊電影雜誌，翻開檢閲一下，就可以發現那時的觀衆，所曉得明星們的事，是多末渺茫呀。在那時的電影明星，是每一個人具有各種可欽可佩的美德的。他們都是出身於名門責閥，都是崇仰莎士庇亞的。那時的宣傳員，是萬能的。他可以一手掩盡天下人的耳目，不讓眞情實况洩露出去，一方面還可以捏造事實，騙得影迷們神魂顚倒。譬如説，珊達巴拉（Ｔheia　Ｂara)的眞名，原呌珊杜茜亞古德曼（Ｔheadosia　Goodman)她明明是美國人，宣傳員確説她是生在斐洲尼羅河畔的。其實，這般明星們眞實的事蹟，比宣傳員所捏造的，美麗，堂皇，生動，有趣的多。但是他們却吃了飯，沒有事做，一定要造一些新聞，來欺騙觀衆。現在的觀衆，可不比從前了。他們慣於眞實的東西，亦不以一個明星的娶妻生子爲奇了。</p>

<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「義客怪刀」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Menace丨丨國泰</p>
<p>影片的譯名，到現在似乎可以説一聲歎觀止矣！「義客怪刀」四個字讀來，覺得硬生生的，不像是個了不起的影片的題名。</p>
<p>再則偵探片接觸得太多了之後，確實不能引起多大的興趣，千篇一律而無原則的結構成一個殺人的故事，所謂緊張刺　的獲得，便是偵探影片的成功。因而對於「義客怪刀」，我幾乎是無話可説的。</p>
<p>不過，我可以告訴讀者諸君，這一影片在開始時用暴雨的應響效果，暗示以後的劇情將用緊張的空氣中進行，乃是頗爲可取的。</p>
<p>其後却全是每一部偵探影片慣用的手法，來幾個嫌疑兇手，將眞兇用攝影技巧隠藏起來，到最後便是案情大白。如此這般，對於人們眞是大熟悉了。</p>
<p>無論那一方面説，都足以説明這是一部庸俗的作品而已。</p>
<h3>「生之哀歌」與「娥皇女英</h3>
<p>歌謠之對於一個民族，有着深切的關係，是人所共認的事實。所以一齣歌謠的流行，即是一個民族的民族性的表現。有時，僅以數十字的慷慨激昂的歌辭，能激奮了整個民族的熱血，同時，數十字的頑廢誨淫的歌辭，也能萎靡　的整個民族的鋭氣，故歌謠之對於社會，國家的影響，可謂至深且巨。同時，影片是國家文化推進的利器，故在影片中，宴插進一兩個適合劇情的歌曲，其丵影片本身，不僅形成多一層的力量，而且對於全體故事的展開，能有着較深刻的印象劃入人們的腦海裏。藝華公司鉅片，胡鋭導演的「生之哀歌」，因係描寫現社會上之嚴重問題，如失業青年之痛苦情形，故事的進展是抓住貧富階級的對照。故爲着使劇中空氣的强化起見，特地插入了兩齣歌曲，即代表小市民之嗟嘆聲的「黎明暉」唱的「生之哀歌」，及代表特殊階級之靡爛生活讚美聲的胡萍唱的「娥皇女英」。不僅歌曲的幽揚動人，就是歌詞也句句刺人心絃。</p>
<h3>葉娟娟被蹂躪</h3>
<p>處在野心家的鐵蹄蹂躪下，一羣失了家的無辜的東北百姓，　向關内逃生。袁美雲，葉娟娟即是此災民中的兩朶美麗的花。然而，葉娟娟却在極度恐慌中和一陣騷擾的人羣下走失了她的愛人丨丨王引，而爲當地惡棍趙雪設計騙至天津，貢獻於其主人袁　美，作爲無上的禮物了。</p>
<p>夜燈初上時，吾人可能從馬路上看見袁公館的盛大的酒宴。燈火煇煌，高賓滿座。歡笑聲，呼喝聲，互相應和，煞是熱閙。可是誰知此堂皇雄偉的袁公館裏的一室，有着一個如待宰羔羊的可隣的少女，而葉娟娟純潔的處女，將失在袁　美的蹂躪之下呢！</p>
<p>這是藝華公司岳楓導演的「逃亡」裏的一個塲面。因爲佈景的偉大，和鏡頭的衆多。故一連工作了十數個鐘頭始告竣事。</p>

<p>同巖得到三票的，有一風流寡婦，二返眞歸　，三我愛伊人，四小偉人，五東方快車，六悽紅慘綠，七大富之家。</p>

<h3>警吏乘龍（Ｗhite　Ｌies)（七）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>瓊不相信似的看着康登，奾明白她所指望的，現在已是無望了。她聳了一聳肩膀，戴上了帽子，就跟着康登走上了警車。等到約翰密契爾聽見説，也的女兒被捉起來了，犯了槍殺亞塞爾之嫌疑，他就咆哮跳了起來。但是證據確　，並且有房東太太當堂證明，房子是他們兩個人租的。瓊説那房子是她替曼麗梅洛利租的，但是誰都沒有看見曼麗梅洛利。人家連聽都沒有聽見過。丹奥立佛已經失蹝了很久了。他來到那所房子裏，誰都沒有看見。再則，那支槍上明明有瓊的指紋。再則康登到那兒的時候，祗有瓊一個人在死者身旁。要是再由康登來一證明，由各種情形看來，瓊殺人的嫌疑，就更加重了。</p>
<p>密契爾跑到康登那裏，想買通他，呌他不要到法庭作見證。但是康登不肯。他説「不興。就是爲了瓊，我都不能那樣做。」密契爾生氣道：「好吧。你是我提拔起來的。我旣能提拔你，我就不能了結你嗎？」康登詫異道：「什麽？提拔我的？你説我的升隊長，是你的勢力造成的嗎？」密契爾恨恨地道：「當然咯。你還不知道嗎？」康登道：「哦原來如此。你糟踐了奥立佛，又提拔了我。兩種手段，都是不名譽的。」他説完了，很生氣的走了出去。他當天晚上，就寫了一個辭呈，遞給了總監。</p>
<p>康登拒絶了密契爾的請求，並且自已提出了請呈之後，多少天不好意思去見瓊。但是最後仙不能忍耐了。他跑到監牢裏去看她。他們這次的相見，是很緊張而帶着痛苦的。康登囁嚅着道：「我好幾天不敢來，因爲我想你一定恨我，而不肯見我的。」瓊很安閑的説道：「那裏有的事。泰萊我怎能恨你呢？這是你了職份，我很明白，」康登頓了一頓，突然對着瓊道：「瓊，我想一個方法。如果你能······和我結婚，他們就不能呌我到法庭做見證了。」瓊聽見了，眼睛裏立時露出高興的神氣，但是過了一回，她慢慢搖着頭道：「别人旣不能使你改變你宗旨，我亦不來使你改變宗旨。」她説着，將兩隻手搭在康登的肩膀上道：「泰萊，你知道我决不肯騙你的。我沒有打死亞塞爾　。我發誓我沒有。你不能不信我。現在我們惟一的生路，就是要當着曼麗梅洛利，或是尋到了奥立佛，一切就水落石出了。」康登跳了起來道：「親愛的，我去尋找他們。你放心。我一定要找到他們。」他説着，將瓊抱住了，在她的香唇上吻着就走了。一切的證人。都審問完了，獨是泰萊康登不知下落。不過在這個時候，康登像上隻獵犬一樣，四面八方在尋覓曼麗梅洛利和丹奥立佛兩個人。後來居然被他尋到了一個綫索，我離城不遠的山中，尋到了一間小木屋，曼麗梅洛利和丹奥立佛就藏在那裏。差不多毫不費力地，康登將奥立佛捉住了，帶進了地方監獄。奥立佛在地方監獄裏，就招供了亞塞爾勃蘭特利是他打死的。他並且將口供上簽了字。這樣一來，眞犯已經捉到，瓊密契爾就恢復了自山。在瓊密契爾當堂開脱罪名的　天晚上，封面密契爾，泰萊，康登，和瓊，很商興地手挽着手，從大堂階上走下來的時候，一般新聞記者，攝影記者，電影新聞記者，部圍攏了來。密契爾自言自語道：「這才是今年最大的新聞哩。」泰萊望着契爾笑道：「密契爾先主　，你是地方上路有勢力的人。你能不能在這深夜，立即替我們弄一張結婚允許證來！」（完</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Arrived in Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan and Qi Dechun arrived in Beiping this evening. Song said that after being away from Beiping for over a month, he returned to Beiping to meet with Huang Fu to report everything and to attend the inauguration of the Committee for the Preservation of Cultural Relics of the Ancient Capital. After staying in Beiping for a few days, he will return to Zhangjiakou. The Chahar East area is peaceful and the weather is very warm. The remnants of Yang Hou's bandit gang have now crossed the river and are scattered in northern Shaanxi. Qi said that Chahar East is currently very peaceful. The Chahar government has been established for five years, and the construction plan is being carried out in four stages: first, road construction; second, afforestation; third, animal husbandry; and fourth, sanitation. They have now started separately. The Chahar area is sparsely populated, and it is planned to add county administrations. The Yang bandits are now scattered in northern Shaanxi, and there are no traces of bandits within Chahar. I will not stay in Beiping for long and will return to Chahar in a few days. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Bandits in Various Counties on the Hebei Border Repeatedly Cause Disturbances</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Miyun stated that five or sixty remnants of Liu Guitang's troops, after fleeing into Miyun, robbed people of their property and recruited men along the way. They recently fled from Dayu Mountain and Taoling to Huangmenzi, where they set up camp. The second battalion commander of the security team, Xu Shiying, led his troops to cooperate with the second detachment leader of the defense corps, Ren Zhengming, to pursue and encircle them. The bandits fled to the Nanshuiyu Beishan area of the second district of the county yesterday afternoon. The police and the defense corps jointly encircled and suppressed them, engaging in fierce fighting for two days and nights, capturing four bandits, more than ten mules and horses, and one gun. Many silver ornaments were found on the bandits, and the bandits were sent to the county government for investigation and punishment. Because they were hard-pressed, the remaining bandits were unable to stay and fled towards Jixian via the Huangyaguan small pass. The security team searched various places east of the city and, finding no trace of the bandits, withdrew to their original defenses. According to the villagers, the bandit leader is about fifty years old, with a black beard, and was a senior bandit of Liu Guitang's troops. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than 300 bandits, half on horseback and half on foot, with a third unarmed, were discovered in Mengxian County, Hebei, fleeing from Bingjingguan. They engaged in robbery and rape, causing great suffering. Dozens of villages were victimized. On the 8th, they were already harassing the outskirts of the county. The county magistrate sent a special telegram requesting the dispatch of troops to suppress them. The Hebei provincial government transferred a portion of the 51st Army to be responsible for suppressing bandits in areas outside the war zone. The provincial government is responsible for supplies. The army headquarters plans to allocate five battalions to set out within the next few days. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The bandits under Liu Guitang have been causing disturbances on the border of Changping, Miyun, and Huairou. Each group has only twenty or thirty people left. Xu Shiying's troops from the first battalion of the security team are cooperating with Ma Wenduan, director of the Huairou Public Security Bureau, to intercept them separately. The public security team and the defense corps have deployed defenses at various passes along the Great Wall border. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than 500 bandits, all cavalry, who have entered Jixian's Huangyaguan and Pinggu's Jiangjunguan, each with two or three horses, belong to a brigade commander formerly under Liu Guitang. This group of bandits was gathered from various passes along the Great Wall line and intends to enter the war zone and join the bandits in Yutian. On the 8th, they made contact with the third battalion of the first general team of the Hebei security team on the border between Pinggu and Jixian. On the 8th, the bandits in Yutian County fled north from the fourth district of Yutian, intending to join the bandits outside the pass. They were blocked by the militia and the second battalion of the security team on the border of Jixian. It seems that the two groups of bandits had a prearranged plan. The provincial authorities specially ordered the security team to make efforts to eliminate them to prevent them from expanding their influence. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<h3>War Zone Clearing Committee to Convene Extraordinary Meeting on Schedule</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The War Zone Clearing Committee is scheduled to convene another extraordinary meeting in Beiping on the 15th.

(Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<h3>South Bank of Wujiang River Remnant Bandits Reported Eliminated</h3>
<p>(Changsha) Liu Jianxu's troops have completely eliminated the area south of the Wujiang River and are immediately taking shortcuts to pursue and intercept. The Provincial Party Headquarters has set up a suppression assistance office in Changde, recommending Liu Yuehou as a three-member resident in Changde to preside over the office. Xu Yuanquan's troops have been annihilating the scattered troops of Li Jue's forces between Cili and Yongding, and He Xiao's forces between Tao and Yongding, with considerable gains, and are immediately advancing towards Dayong to suppress them. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Zhu-Mao bandits continue to flee northwest. Hou Zidan's troops are in contact with the bandits at the front. After Xue Yue's troops arrived in Guiyang, the morale of the Guizhou army was greatly boosted. Two brigades of Sichuan army mortars are successively heading to the Guizhou border. Guo Xunqi's brigade entered Qinan and is stationed in the county. It is difficult for the bandits to flee into Sichuan. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>Division Commander Chen Mingqian's Division has already set out from Fuling towards the front. The bandits have</p>
<h3>Postal Service Restored Inside and Outside the Customs</h3>
<p>Staff at the Beiping and Tianjin Post Offices Are Very Busy</p>
<p>Special Stamps Not Sold Inside the Customs</p>
<p>Report on the Establishment of the Transit Bureau</p>
<p>(Beiping) Postal service with the Northeast has now begun to be restored, and the staff at the Beiping Post Office are suddenly very busy. As of noon, excluding ordinary letters, more than four hundred express and registered letters have been received. Money order and parcel services are scheduled to be implemented on the first of next month.

It will take four or five months to know what kind of talent should be added. On the first day of the resumption of postal services today, the Tianjin Post Office had received more than 800 letters to the outside of the customs by the time it stopped working in the afternoon, as well as more than 130 foreign newspapers, but no domestic newspapers. The post office was quite busy. Parcel services will begin to be accepted on February 1st, but the postage before September 18th was lower. Now, due to the long distance to Jilin and Heilongjiang, and the special relationship, an additional fee of one times the normal rate will be charged per kilogram. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<h3>Archaeological Excavation Work and Its Contributions in the Past Two Years by Zheng Shi Xu</h3>
<p>It is to be noted that since the discovery of "Peking Man", archaeological excavation in China has become an important contribution to Chinese academia. In recent years, news of ancient tombs being excavated in various places has been disclosed from time to time. However, these are fragmentary and scattered, making it difficult for readers to grasp the full picture. The 22nd issue of this newspaper's yearbook specially invited Mr. Li Ji to provide a comprehensive account. Now, we have commissioned Mr. Zheng to write this systematic article, which is published first for those studying this issue to read quickly.</p>
<p>In the past two years, China's archaeological work has indeed made significant progress and practical contributions. Taking the excavation work led by the Academia Sinica as an example, there have been as many as thirteen excavations in two years. The times are listed in a simple table as follows:</p>
<p>(1) April 1 to May 28, 1933: Third Excavation at Xincun, Junxian County, Henan. (2) October 20 to December 25, 1933: Eighth Yinxu Excavation. (3) October 20 to December 10, 1933: Fourth Excavation at Xincun, Junxian County. (4) October 24 to November 30, 1933: First Excavation at Anshang Village, Tengxian County, Shandong. (5) October 26 to November 30, 1933: First Excavation of the Eastern Cao Wang Tomb in Anshang Village. (6) November 15, 1933 to January 24, 1934: Third Excavation at Hougang, Anyang. (7) September 1934 to March 31, 1935: Ninth Yinxu Excavation. (8) March 15 to May 22, 1934: Fourth Hougang Excavation. (9) April 2 to June 2, 1934: Second Excavation at Houjiazhuang, Anyang / Excavation at Wuguan Village. (10) May 2 to May 17, 1934: First Excavation at Mayugou Changpocun, Gongxian County, Henan. (11) May 21 to May 29, 1934: First Excavation at Chengou Village, Guangwu County, Henan, at Aowangding.</p>
<p>(12) October 2, 1934: Tenth Yinxu Excavation at Houjiazhuang, still underway at the end of the year. (13) October 15 to November 15, 1934: Second Excavation in Guangwu County. During these two years of excavation, although half of it was a continuation of old work, in order to explore the distribution and contact areas of black pottery and painted pottery cultures, the organizers had a plan to investigate and excavate along the south bank of the Yellow River. The trial excavations in Gongxian County and Guangwu County, Henan, were the first step in their work. In recent years, other parties have also been interested in archaeological work, such as the Henan Antiquities Research Association, professors and interns from Shandong University, etc., all of whom have participated in the work. The results of the excavation have also made quite a few contributions to China's ancient history. Roughly speaking, three items can be obtained:</p>
<p>1. Clarification of the Architectural Culture of the Yin and Shang Dynasties: The foundation of Shang Dynasty architecture was discovered during the seventh excavation. In the eighth excavation, two rammed-earth building foundations were found. In addition to the stone foundations, ten copper-cast foundations were also found. Under the rammed earth, a large round pit of the cave dwelling from the Black Pottery era was discovered, and a considerable connection was made with those excavated in previous years. During the second Houjiazhuang excavation, large round caves where the Yin people lived, building foundations, rammed earth, stone foundations, earthen steps, and cellars, similar to the Yinxu in Xiaotun, were discovered. Thus, the architectural culture of the Yin Dynasty can be understood.</p>
<p>2. Determination of the Cultural Level of the Yin and Shang Dynasties: The Shang Dynasty was a key point in the transition from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age, which is undoubtedly confirmed by the artifacts unearthed in the past. However, within the cultural layer of the Yinxu, there are also unsmelted copper ore, broken pieces of red-fired earth, charcoal, and "General Helmet" that can be used for smelting, which can be used to estimate the method of smelting copper by the Yin people.</p>
<p>3. Confirmation of the Actual Distribution of Yin and Shang Culture: The cultural area of the Shang Dynasty was from the south of the Yellow River to the east to the Shandong area. Wang Guowei had already made this assumption in the past. The results of the excavations in the past two years have further proved that this statement is not wrong. Oracle bone inscriptions are unique to Yinxu, and the characters on the pottery of Chengziyai are similar in font. As for the oracle bones used for divination, they have also been found repeatedly in Chengziyai, Anshang Village, Shandong, etc., and they have all been drilled and burned, which are largely the same as those unearthed from Yinxu, and are indeed influenced by the Yin and Shang cultures. In addition, the Black Pottery culture was first discovered in Chengziyai and was unique to the Shandong area. Now, Xincun in Junxian County, Hougang in Anyang, Houjiazhuang, and Tapo Village in Gongxian County all have it. The unearthed artifacts are also the same as the lower-level culture period of Chengziyai. During the third excavation in Junxian County, a pottery kiln was also found, which was very complete. This shows the general situation of cultural exchange and distribution between the two places.</p>
<p>In addition, the Institute of History and Philology of the Peking Academy and the Shaanxi Archaeological Society presided over the excavation of the sites of the Xingqing Palace and Daming Palace of the Tang Dynasty in the Shaanxi Provincial Government Hall in February and March of 1934. The stone maps of the two palaces were obtained, with a relatively precise scale, which is of great benefit to the archaeological community.</p>
<p>Special collections of reports have been printed due to the excavation results. In 1933, there was the Gao Lutaog Collection printed by the Northwest Science Expedition. The excavation report of Chengziyai by the Academia Sinica has been announced for publication, and the excavation report of Yinxu is being sorted and edited.</p>
<p>At the same time, in addition to the Northwest Science Expedition and the Guangzhou Huanghua Archaeological Institute, which had been established before, the China Archaeological Society was established in Shanghai on May 14, 1933, the Shaanxi Archaeological Society was established in Xi'an in the spring of 1934, and the Archaeological Society was established in Peiping on September 1, 1934. The Archaeological Society was initiated and organized by archaeologists from the north and south. It has published a journal, three special archaeological collections, one type A and three type B of archaeological series, specifically for research work. In addition, there are two things that must be recorded: one is the proposal of Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan, to protect ancient tombs, and the other is the order of Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, and Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, to protect cultural relics. For details on the exchange of letters and telegrams opposing the excavation of ancient tombs, see the 15th issue of the Yenching Journal. As for Wang Jiang's telegram, it elaborated on the work outline of the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee, hoping that the whole country would cooperate to carry forward the national spirit. On July 12, 1934, the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee was established in the Executive Yuan, and on December 17, the Rules for Mining Antiquities, the Application Form for Mining Antiquities, and the Application Form for Exporting Antiquities were passed. This implies the intention of protection in the development, which can be said to take both sides into account. It is intended that the trend of tomb robbery and the smuggling of cultural relics out of the country can be stopped in the future. All of this can promote the development of our archaeological cause.</p>
<h3>Takahashi's Fiscal Policy Conflicts with Military Opinion</h3>
<p>Warning Against Unlimited Investment in Manchuria</p>
<p>British Press Believes it Could Save Constitutional Government</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi reported on the international lending and borrowing situation last year at the cabinet meeting on the 8th, and also discussed the control of investment in Manchuria and the Manchurian Incident expenses. The Army General Staff Headquarters expressed the following opinions on this: (1) The Finance Minister is worried that investments in Manchuria have not yet yielded profits. From this point of view, he advocates large-scale investment and opposes the proliferation of uncontrolled small companies. His motivation for controlling investment differs from that of the military, so he has no choice but to oppose it. However, investment in Manchuria is a national policy, and sacrifices should be made at the beginning. (2) The Finance Minister is also worried about the inflow of funds into China and opposes the military's economic policy toward Manchuria. However, the adoption of the silver standard in Manchuria is a last resort. Occasionally, because China also adopts the silver standard, there is a slight outflow, so there is no reason to oppose the military, but countermeasures should be considered. (3) The Finance Minister opposes the continued expenditure of the Manchurian Incident expenses, but the threat from the Russian army is growing, and the reality does not allow the budget to be canceled. The Finance Minister is also worried that the huge Manchurian Incident expenses will affect international lending and borrowing relations and leak capital. This is a short-sighted observation. A person holding the post of Finance Minister must be careful in his words. (Hualian Electric, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times recently commented on the speech made by Japanese Finance Minister Takahashi in the cabinet meeting yesterday on financial issues, saying that this speech is very important. Takahashi warned his countrymen about the difficult financial situation in Japan, but the intention of his speech is not limited to this. Takahashi is openly opposing the claims of military leaders. In recent years, it has been common for civil servants in the cabinet to become pawns of the army and navy. Due to several cases of financial corruption, Japanese public opinion is deeply dissatisfied with the political parties. On the contrary, it is happy to accept the huge military expenditure demands of the army and navy. This is partly due to a sense of fatalism and partly due to increased vanity and patriotism. National propaganda is often monopolized by active-duty soldiers who shout incessantly. This is also the case in Japan. However, recently, civil servants in the cabinet have also been preparing to criticize military policy from a financial perspective. Although the former Finance Minister Fujii eventually fell into a difficult situation, he did his best to reduce military expenditure requests and oppose the military budget during his tenure. The theory on which this military budget is based is that Japan is sooner or later in danger of war. Now that Takahashi has returned to the position of Finance Minister, although he is not as openly opposed to the military budget as Fujii, he can gain strength from his rich experience and broad international reputation, and his warnings will be more effective. It is also a tonic for the weak and incompetent Japanese party politics. (Havas Electric, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Times today criticized the position of the Japanese budget案 in an editorial, mentioning that Japanese Finance Minister Takahashi warned the cabinet yesterday not to invest in Manchuria without limitation, saying that what is more meaningful than Takahashi's warning is that Takahashi has openly confronted the warlords. In recent years, civilian cabinet members seem to have become pawns of the military, and propaganda has become the exclusive patent of the military. Although the country is in urgent need, the politicians cannot cope with it. The statement is constantly clamoring. Although the former Finance Minister Fujii was eventually rejected, he tried his best to restrain the demands of the military. Although Takahashi has not yet taken this action, with his experience and reputation, his warning should be more powerful, or it may have a good impact on Japanese party politics, which has recently caused Japan to be in a state of great vitality.

<p>But Avoid Causing Drastic Fluctuations in Silver Prices</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today that despite opposition from the Far East, the U.S. government will continue to purchase large quantities of silver bullion, but will use the lowest price, and the Treasury Department will also avoid causing drastic fluctuations in world silver prices when purchasing silver. It has been rumored that the Treasury Department's silver purchases have gradually decreased. Today, officials from the department said that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has stated that he is determined to complete the 1934 Silver Purchase Act. Officials from the Treasury Department also stated that the silver coinage surplus item in the budget does not indicate how much silver the government will purchase. However, official circles have stated that the large-scale silver purchase plan will continue. News from Shanghai stated that the Treasury Secretary has allowed China to ease the silver purchase plan to avoid sharp increases in silver prices, and agreed to use other methods to purchase silver to avoid reducing China's silver reserves. Congressional silver faction members are still paying close attention to this. In addition, the statement that the Treasury Department has reduced silver purchases has made them want to establish a bill as soon as possible. The leaders of the faction did not hope that it would have any significant results, but at that time, their own opinions were divided, so they failed to establish a mandatory bill. (National Electric, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pope stated today that $1.39 per ounce of silver should be the goal of the silver faction. The Treasury Department has failed to do its best to purchase silver on the world market and should continue to purchase silver at home and abroad. Pope estimated that $0.96 is the minimum silver price, and this silver price can make all silver mines profitable. He is willing to support the bill of the gold-silver ratio of sixteen to one.

<p>Saar Factions Confront Each Other</p>
<h3>Demonstration Situation is Turbulent</h3>
<p>The Internationale and German Songs are Sung Together</p>
<p>Portraits of Lenin and Hitler are Hung Side by Side</p>
<p>The Voting Results Can Now Be Predicted</p>
<p>Demonstrators from opposing parties in Saarbrücken today nearly clashed, but a police detachment quickly arrived to avoid causing trouble. Members of the German Front and those who advocated maintaining the status quo in the Saar gathered at the station today to welcome some voters returning from the United States, but the guests did not arrive as scheduled. The demonstrators on both sides suddenly began to shout wildly, insulting each other, and singing the Internationale and the German national anthem. At that time, the situation was turbulent, and a conflict seemed inevitable. However, the leaders of the German Front tried their best to restrain their comrades until the police arrived.</p>
<p>Everything is normal on the streets here, except that a shop opened by a Marxist member displayed a portrait of Lenin. Many shops have portraits and busts of Nazi leaders in their windows, as well as Nazi slogans. Although the appearance is normal, the hearts of the people are extremely nervous. There are fake leaflets being distributed announcing that Hitler's Catholic Union has been dissolved because the union cannot be combined with the godless Communists. It is also heard that residents who advocate maintaining the status quo are also distributing fake leaflets signed by Hitler's loyal party members. Both sides are trying to confuse right and wrong to achieve their goals. The authorities are deeply worried that the ballot boxes from all over the place will be stolen en route to the central counting center on Sunday, so they have made meticulous preparations and are also preventing disruptive behavior. Today, it was heard that a special train carrying the ballot boxes will be guarded by foreign soldiers, and will be protected by motorcycle convoys, tank artillery vehicles, armed vehicles, and motorized vehicles. The result of the vote seems predictable, but it is expected that the number of votes advocating maintaining the status quo will account for between 20% and 40% of the total votes.</p>
<p>According to a London telecommunications report, the Manchester Guardian stated that according to the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations can divide the Saar according to the comparative strength of the votes, but the powers clearly want to preserve the integrity of the Saar. According to another message from London, the United Kingdom has inquired to Germany whether it would be willing to send a representative to attend the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations to discuss the results of the Saar plebiscite in the future, but it has not yet received a reply. However, all recent arrangements regarding the Saar vote have been carried out in close cooperation with Germany. According to Germany, it could have participated in the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations until October, but since the German government notified its withdrawal from the League of Nations, it has never attended any meeting of the League of Nations. (Reuters Electric, 10th)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken Saar residents are becoming increasingly anxious as the voting date approaches. In the past two weeks, the number of cash transfers across the border to banks in France has been increasing, reaching 100 million francs, for fear that the money will be withheld after the plebiscite. (Reuters Electric, 9th)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken The Saar region plebiscite will be held on January 13. However, public officials, prison inmates, and hospital patients will vote in advance on January 7, 8, and 9. A total of 1,034 votes were cast in the three days, including 480 hospital patients, 360 public officials, and 194 prison inmates. According to those who are allowed to vote in advance, it is expected that there will be 2,200 people, and hospital patients are not included. It can be seen that the number of people who actually voted is very small. (Havas Electric, 9th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Representative Scathingly Criticizes the French Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Said to be Encouraging Separatist Movements</p>
<p>(Berlin) Burkell, the special envoy appointed by Hitler to handle the Saar issue, gave a fiery speech at the Kaiser Palace in Bavaria today, scathingly criticizing French Foreign Minister Laval, saying that Laval encouraged the Saar separatists to believe that a second plebiscite could be held, which is an illusion. Burkell also condemned Christians for joining the Communist Party and advocating maintaining the status quo in the Saar, saying that this behavior is using the name of Christ to betray the country. Burkell finally denied the claim that detention camps would be set up after the Saar plebiscite. (Reuters Electric, 9th)</p>
<p>Kaiserslautern Berger, the special commissioner for the Saar region appointed by German Head of State Hitler, made a declaration to foreign journalists here today, first making optimistic comments on the popular vote to be held on Sunday, saying that "harmonious ways have been unimpeded since January 13." Berger also said that at present, people all over the world are asking who will win or lose on Sunday. If this kind of question is explored with international significance, then after the vote, no matter who wins or loses, the day the vote is completed will be the time when the competition begins, because the entire voting issue will become the focus of the competition between Germany and France from beginning to end. However, if the current real problem is considered with conscience, it is felt that the Saar problem is no longer a problem of international political competition, and after the various erroneous paths that have not been resolved before, after the Saar problem is removed from the scope of international discussion, then the so-called Saar problem is purely a German affair, because this affair can only be resolved by the Germans. Berger continued to discuss the possibility of extending the status quo after the vote. He said that this possibility is a disingenuous assumption to conceal the meaning of the vote. If the League of Nations agrees to hold a second vote in the future, the Saar Statute will be completely destroyed, because the so-called maintenance of the status quo and the term of maintenance, etc., the people of the Saar will no longer be able to ask about it, and all subsequent measures will be subject to political events outside the German border and the will of foreign governments. However, the German people in the Saar, no matter what, do not want to entrust the fate of their future to foreigners and foreign governments. Therefore, those who want to extend the status quo are aiming to permanently separate the Saar from the German homeland. (National Electric, 9th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Dispute Between Persia and Iraq</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 84th session of the Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to open tomorrow. This is probably the last meeting before Japan's notice of withdrawal from the League of Nations takes effect. The future of the islands administered by Japan may be discussed after the meeting. (Reuters Electric, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The regular meeting of the Council of the League of Nations opened on January 11, chaired by Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü. The first meeting is expected to begin on Tuesday of next week. There are more than 30 proposals on the agenda of this session, the most important of which are the Saar issue and the border dispute between Iraq and Persia. (Havas Electric, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Persia recently sent a memorandum to the League of Nations, stating its position on the Iraqi border dispute. Iraq had previously protested under Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, saying that Persia did not abide by the 1914 border agreement and wanted to obtain sovereignty over the Arab River. The Persian Foreign Minister has now told reporters that the current dispute was caused by the Anglo-Russian agreement and the 1914 border treaty that forced Persia to accept it. The above-mentioned treaty has not been accepted by the Persian and former Turkish parliaments. Iraq has since become an independent country and joined the League of Nations. Persia hopes to re-determine the border, as the Republic of Turkey did, but the Iraqi government refused to accept it. Therefore, Persia intends to take the center of the river as the boundary according to custom, and does not allow the river bank as the boundary as determined in 1914. (National Electric, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Soviet government has recently paid its dues for the first quarter of 1935 to the League of Nations. This move is earlier than other countries. Rozanpei, the Soviet representative in France, has been appointed as Assistant Secretary of the League of Nations. The Soviet representatives in the various committees of the League of Nations will be appointed separately by the Council during this session. (Havas Electric, 10th)</p>
<h3>China Has Hopes of Obtaining a League of Nations Council Seat</h3>
<p>(Paris) When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval met in Rome a few days ago, they discussed the issue of the League of Nations. If Germany rejoins the League of Nations, it will increase one Council seat. At the same time, one seat will also be set up in Asia, so that China has the opportunity to obtain it.

<h3>Britain Pays Attention to the Defenses of Singapore</h3>
<p>Singapore heard that Queensland Chief Administrator Wilson has taken two months of leave to travel to the Orient and is about to visit Singapore. It is said that this trip is purely private in nature, but regarding the report recently released by Hankey, Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, it is believed that Wilson is paying attention to the defenses of the new port.

<h3>French Cabinet Approves the Franco-Italian Rome Accords</h3>
<p>Submitted to Parliament for Approval</p>
<p>(Paris) At the cabinet meeting held this morning, Foreign Minister Laval gave a detailed explanation of the Rome Accords, which took up the entire time of the meeting. The cabinet then approved it, congratulated Laval, and authorized Laval to submit the original text of the Accords to both houses for approval. (Havas Electric, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently published an analysis of the Rome Accords, stating that in the matter of African colonies, the Franco-Italian treaty has finally resolved the pending issues between the two countries. On the issue of Central Europe, the two governments unanimously believe that the obligation of all countries to reaffirm their respect for the independence and integrity of other countries' territories is a principle advocated by both countries. This principle is sufficient to develop the sentiment of trust among the countries in the Central European region. Finally, the Franco-Italian Accords stated that Mussolini and Laval recognized that all future disputes could be submitted to the League of Nations for resolution in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Covenant. (Havas Electric, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The newspapers this morning commented on the scope of the Franco-Italian Accords. The Italian Daily said that the main nature of this Accords is political. It is rumored that the Rome Accords have the form of a financial agreement, stipulating that France will provide cash assistance to Italy, which is untrue. The Italian side has neither made such a request nor will it make such a request in the future. The Fanxi Party Working News stated that the Franco-Italian Accords create a new stage in European politics, opening the door for joint action between Italy and the Little Entente countries.

<h3>French Foreign Minister Receives Russian and Austrian Envoys</h3>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Meets with Yugoslavian Foreign Minister</p>
<p>(Paris) After returning from Rome, Foreign Minister Laval immediately visited Prime Minister Flandin to report on the Rome negotiations. He then met with President Lebrun, presenting the full text of the Franco-Italian agreement. The President expressed his congratulations. In the afternoon, Laval also received the Soviet Ambassador to France, Potemkin, and the Austrian Ambassador to France, Moerwaart. He is scheduled to depart for Geneva on Friday to attend the League of Nations Council meeting. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: Turkish Foreign Minister Ruşti, on his way to Geneva, made a 24-hour stopover here. He took the opportunity to have a long conversation with Prime Minister Jevtić, who also serves as Foreign Minister. Ruşti also paid a visit to Prince Regent Paul. It is reported that the discussion mainly focused on the attitude that the Balkan Entente countries should adopt towards the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) British Lord Privy Seal Eden stated in a speech in Edinburgh that the Franco-Italian agreement is an important achievement in stabilizing European peace. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Doubts the Strength of the Franco-Italian Agreement</h3>
<p>Claiming that it is not yet fully resolved</p>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia commented on the Franco-Italian agreement, stating: "Have France and Italy truly reached a complete agreement? Currently, information from Rome has not provided a definitive answer to this question. Although the two countries have a protocol proving their complete agreement, it cannot be said that they have a complete understanding, as such general statements have no practical effect on any country. In the protocol on Austria, France and Italy express their willingness to maintain Austria's independence and state that they will consult if Austria's independence is threatened in any way. If this protocol is limited to this and contains no more concrete content, then people will ask, 'Did France and Italy not want to maintain Austria's independence before this? Did they not consult when Austrian fascists attacked?' The whole problem lies in the following: If Austria is in danger, will France and Italy act in unison? If this understanding is not completed, then the Rome Agreement will neither enhance Austria's security nor benefit the security of other relevant countries. As for inviting other countries to join, we believe that all of Austria's neighbors except Germany can agree. We even believe that Germany itself has no reason not to join on the issue of Austria's independence. The road to hell is paved with grand statements. Without serious guarantees and without practical action to fulfill what is said, there can be no peace in Europe. The Rome negotiations, as the British press has said, are a manifestation of creating some favorable conditions for building a bridge between France and Germany. British diplomats are working in this direction. This is nothing more than obtaining a moderate amount of rhetoric and documents from the German side and allowing Germany the legal right to expand its military." Izvestia stated that the Soviet Union is always willing to solve general problems through cooperation and is willing to conclude the Eastern Regional Pact, which can consolidate the security of the people of Eastern Europe. Other regional issues must also be resolved in this way. At the same time, only agreements that strictly stipulate the rights and obligations of the participants have weight. If the Rome Agreement can indeed meet these requirements, then Moscow will support it. (TASS, 9th)</p>
<h3>London Speculates on the Future of Anglo-French Negotiations</h3>
<p>Discussing the Stabilization of Currency Values</p>
<p>(London) According to information obtained by London's financial circles today, when French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval visit London in late January, they will raise the issue of stabilizing the exchange rate between the pound and the franc. However, London experts believe that this French proposal will definitely fail at present. It is still remembered that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stated in a speech to the House of Commons before Christmas that the instability of the dollar and franc exchange rates would make it difficult to achieve the stability of the pound. Furthermore, it is now widely rumored that French dignitaries are coming here to discuss various issues that have recently developed in Europe, in addition to stabilizing exchange rates. The most important of these is probably the reopening of the Disarmament Conference, the recent Franco-Italian agreement, Anglo-French trade, and the Eastern European Pact. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Rumors of stabilizing exchange rates are now rampant in financial circles here. According to reliable sources, the State Department has learned that representatives of European gold-using countries will soon visit London to discuss the issue of stabilizing currency values. However, President Roosevelt has indicated that the United States may not take immediate action in the international monetary situation. According to sources here, although European countries are eager to stabilize currency values, London still believes that the time is not ripe. However, it is expected that France, Belgium, and the Netherlands will exert their pressure on Britain in an attempt to reach an agreement between Britain and the United States on a method of stabilizing currency values.

<h3>The Disarmament Issue is Raised Again</h3>
<p>Paris newspapers discuss the matter extensively</p>
<p>(Paris) The disarmament issue, which has been dormant for a long time, has now been raised again due to the talks between France and Italy, becoming a topic of heated discussion. Paris newspapers have recently reported on the issue. According to Le Journal's observation, Foreign Minister Laval's actual views are quite inconsistent with France's tough note of April 17 last year. According to Mr. Laval's opinion, the danger of Germany's rearmament cannot be eliminated merely by declaring it illegal, nor can it be eliminated merely by ignoring it. Le Journal further confirmed that there was a clear intention in the Rome talks to issue another note to Germany, with the aim of requesting Germany to announce its actual military strength to the major powers in accordance with the spirit of the Five-Power Common Declaration of December 11, 1932. Only then will the major powers be prepared to recognize Germany's rearmament as legal. However, Germany must still agree to sign an international disarmament treaty. Le Journal further stated that Foreign Minister Laval intends to visit Berlin, but the date has not yet been considered. In addition, Le Matin carried a London dispatch, stating that it is quite possible that future disarmament treaties will be based on the following points: (1) Management of the arms trade, (2) Organization of a permanent disarmament committee, (3) Manufacture and application of controlled chemical weapons, (4) Major powers announce military budgets.

<h3>U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Approves Participation in the International Court of Justice</h3>
<p>Abandoning the traditional policy of isolation</p>
<p>Democratic Senators Request the Expulsion of Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today voted in favor of the United States joining the Hague International Court of Justice. This move is of great significance to the future of submitting international legal disputes to arbitration, as today's resolution is tantamount to abandoning the policy of isolation adopted by the United States after President Wilson's departure in 1920. However, the Foreign Relations Committee included reservations in this resolution, one of which is aimed at protecting the United States from being bound by advisory opinions. The reservation states that the United States may join the International Court of Justice, but with the clear understanding that the International Court of Justice shall not, without the opposition of the United States, accept any request to issue an advisory opinion on any dispute or issue related to the United States. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Texas Democratic Congressman Dies recently introduced a bill requesting the government to immediately deport the millions of foreign nationals who have illegally immigrated to the United States, stating that there are currently as many as seven million foreign nationals residing in the United States who have not become U.S. citizens.

<h3>Lindbergh Kidnapping Case Resumes Trial, Doctor Testifies in Court</h3>
<p>Narrating the Circumstances of Paying the Ransom</p>
<p>His Eloquent Delivery Captivates the Audience</p>
<p>Flemington: The Lindbergh kidnapping case resumed trial today. Dr. Condon, who handled the payment of the ransom, testified in court, recounting the event of handing over the ransom of $50,000 to the kidnapper in the cemetery at night, identifying Hauptmann as the person who received the ransom. Dr. Condon recounted the situation at the time, gesturing as he spoke, like a talented actor on stage, captivating the audience, who forgot that they were in court. Dr. Condon spoke for two hours and forty-five minutes, stating three times that the recipient of the money was Hauptmann. Hauptmann's face turned pale upon hearing this, but he glared at Condon, who did not flinch and glared back. Condon's testimony began by stating that the defendant claimed to be John and that he was indeed the person who received the money in the cemetery. Condon first placed an advertisement in a newspaper, using the pseudonym Jafsie to notify the kidnapper that Lindbergh's request could be accepted. He then met this John in the cemetery, talking for an hour and fifteen minutes. During the conversation, John occasionally heard sounds nearby and would jump over the fence and flee in panic, and Condon would follow him. John later calmed down slightly and said, "This is too dangerous. It's either 25 years in prison or being burned to death." By "burned to death," he meant the electric chair. At that time, Condon told him that if John cooperated, he would definitely do his best to help, otherwise he would have to follow him, even to the ends of the earth. He asked John to show him Lindbergh's child, but John refused. Finally, John sent the child's sleeping suit. Condon opened the package and inspected it in front of Lindbergh. Condon said to John in the cemetery at night, "You seem to have the beginning of a lung disease. I can give you medicine now." This statement by Dr. Condon will be a point of contention for the defendant's lawyers, as Hauptmann claims that the banknotes he obtained were given to him by Fisch, who has now died of tuberculosis in Germany.

<h3>Comparison of British and American National Debt</h3>
<p>(Washington) People are generally alarmed by the government's large increase in national debt. Observers familiar with the situation believe that there is no need to worry excessively, as the total U.S. national debt, including the federal government, state governments, cities, and counties, is $481 trillion, which averages $385 per person. However, the average debt burden of British taxpayers is as high as $991 per person. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Should Apologize and Compensate for the Sinking of the Can Private Smuggling Vessel</h3>
<p>(Washington) The case of the U.S. Customs vessel sinking the One Man, a vessel transporting smuggled alcohol, in 1929 has been in litigation for many years. Today, the U.S.-Canada Mixed Commission ruled that the United States should apologize for the incident and pay $25,000 in compensation. The shipowner should not receive compensation, but the crew should not have been subjected to the harsh treatment of being thrown into the sea and imprisoned. Therefore, the United States must compensate the captain $7,906 and the remaining seven crew members each receive compensation ranging from $965 to $1,323. The family members of the drowned crew member should receive $10,185 in compensation. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Gibraltar Strait Tunnel Connects Two Continents</h3>

<p>Delegates sent to England and France for negotiations</p>
<p>Madrid: The Spanish government previously established a committee responsible for studying the plan to dig a tunnel under the Strait of Gibraltar to connect the continents of Europe and Africa. The committee recently held a meeting and decided to send a delegation to Paris and London to hold negotiations with the French African Railway Company and the British Railway Company. According to the British Railway Company's plan to build a railway from Cairo, the capital of Egypt, to Cape Town, the capital of South Africa, if the Gibraltar Tunnel is completed, European trains can travel directly to Cape Town.

<p>(London) According to the Daily Telegraph, the government is currently drafting a large-scale plan to relocate industrial unemployed people to sparsely populated agricultural areas. It is estimated that 18,000 households should be resettled, divided into 115 to 20 groups. The area occupied by each group should not exceed 2 hectares. Each group will be assigned an instructor to teach farming and animal husbandry methods. All material equipment will be provided by the government. The funds required to implement this plan are approximately £14 million. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3>Severe Cold Grips Europe and America</h3>
<p>(London) After the relatively warm weather of Christmas and New Year, Europe and North America are now suffering from severe cold. There is snow and ice throughout the United Kingdom, and London is shrouded in thick fog, hindering air and other transportation. It is reported that there are heavy snowstorms in continental Europe. Even Cannes, which is known for its warm weather, has had light snow in the past two days. New York Harbor has rare heavy fog, causing 13 postal ships to delay their departures by several hours. The Black Sea has experienced strong winds for three days, and several ships have sent out distress signals. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Military Budget Ranks First in the World</h3>
<p>More than doubled compared to before the September 18th Incident</p>
<p>(Washington) The Foreign Policy Association recently announced that the military expenditures of major countries are higher than in the year before the European War. Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident in the Far East in the autumn of 1931 until the Nazi Party took power in Germany in the spring of 1933, the military strength of major countries has expanded significantly. According to the latest budgets for the navy, army, and air force announced by major countries, France's military expenditure has increased by 25.8% compared to 1913, Italy by 26.3%, the United Kingdom by 48.8%, the United States by 190.9%, and Japan by 388%. Since the Manchurian Incident in 1931, Japan's military expenditure has more than doubled. As for Germany, its military strength lags behind because Germany is still legally restricted by the Treaty of Versailles. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Hungary's Revisionist Claims</h3>
<p>Budapest: Hungary recently expressed its opinion on the agreement established by France and Italy in Rome in a semi-official manner. On the one hand, it expressed happiness for the Franco-Italian consultation, and on the other hand, it hoped that Germany could also join in order to establish effective cooperation in Europe. It also believed that the Rome Agreement did not exclude the advocacy of peaceful treaty revision. Therefore, Hungary's goal of revising the treaty is not hindered by it. Hungary's goals for revising the treaty can be summarized in three points: (1) Correct the existing borders based on history and ethnicity; (2) Equality of rights, especially with regard to national defense; (3) The rights of Hungarian minorities in foreign countries must be guaranteed.

<h3>Manchester Chamber of Commerce Publishes Report on Trade with China</h3>
<p>China's purchasing power has decreased in recent years</p>
<p>Japanese commercial competition remains fierce</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Chamber of Commerce today released its annual report on British trade with China, which includes the statement that China is more stable, but the level of trade has decreased. It also stated that the decrease in purchasing power is the main reason for the rapid decline in the Lancashire textile trade. It is not known how the current situation can be improved until China can sell its products at better prices domestically or until the demand for its products increases. Japanese competition remains fierce, especially due to its proximity to China and convenient transportation. However, Japan's export trade is also decreasing. It continued, stating that frequent changes in Chinese tariffs force buyers to be more cautious, and that as trade decreases, tax revenue also decreases, and the high tax rates currently in place encourage large-scale smuggling.

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Regime Organize Economic Council</h3>
<p>Revitalize military and heavy and light industries</p>
<p>Establish immigration control agencies</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Japanese government, based on the cabinet meeting on December 20, proposed to the puppet regime the organization of the "Japan-Manchuria Economic Conference." The puppet regime replied yesterday, agreeing and hoping that the number of members would be small. Therefore, the conference will be established soon. It is reported that the matters to be coordinated will be as follows: (1) Promote the development of heavy industry in Manchuria, such as iron and steel and other heavy industries; (2) Develop light industry, but the above two items must start with the military supplies industry and be controlled to avoid competing with domestic Japanese industries; (3) Immigration: Establish a unified control agency for agricultural immigration.

<h3>Russian and Puppet Regime Waterway Conference</h3>
<p>Both sides compete for Heixiazi Island</p>
<p>Technical Committee Suspends Operations</p>
<p>Border disputes arise frequently</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Harbin Correspondence: The Russian-puppet waterway conference was suspended on December 27, old calendar, after Russia responded to the puppet regime's request to hold a meeting at Daheihe on January 9 of last year. During that period, there were 14 consultations. On September 4, the two sides reached a waterway agreement. The representatives for the consultations were Mokhanenko, director of the shipping bureau for the Russian side, and Horiuchi, director of general affairs of the puppet navigation administration bureau for the puppet side. After the Russian-puppet waterway agreement, river disputes decreased slightly, and both sides were prepared to set boundary markers. However, regarding the delta at the confluence of the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers (named Heixiazi Island), the Russian side insisted that it belonged to Russia, while the puppet side insisted that it belonged to the puppet regime. The Russian side also set up markers, prohibiting the puppet regime from navigating the northern side of the island, and built an airfield on the island, deploying Red Guards, indicating a firm unwillingness to abandon it. The puppet side repeatedly protested, but the Russian side ignored it. The joint technical committee for waterway consultation also formally requested the Russian side to withdraw the markers on December 22. The Russian committee member insisted that it belonged to Russian territory, causing the committee to suspend operations. Heixiazi Island is only 4.5 kilometers away from the Soviet military stronghold of Boli and has an area equal to Iki and Tsushima in Japan. If it is occupied by the Japanese and puppet regime, it will pose a huge threat to Boli, making the dispute difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Nagaoka, deputy consul of the Japanese Consulate General in Harbin, reported the following border disputes between Russia and the puppet regime to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today: (1) Regarding the ownership of Heixiazi Island at the confluence of the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers, the Russian side firmly insisted that it belonged to Russian territory based on the Sino-Russian Treaty of 1860, making it impossible to resolve the dispute. (2) On December 22 last year, the Russian side claimed that four Russian soldiers were kidnapped by puppet soldiers 7 kilometers east of Xingkai Lake. (3) On December 29, six Koreans were kidnapped by Russian soldiers in the eastern border area. In view of the continuous border disputes, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wants to establish a Russian-Japanese-puppet border investigation committee or a border adjustment committee as soon as possible to determine the boundaries.

<h3>Han Fuqu Inspects Party Members Regarding the Zhang Case</h3>
<p>The Bullets Found in Zhan Juncen's Possession Are the Same as Those Used to Assassinate Zhang</p>
<p>Li Wenzhai, Zhan Juncen, and Several Others Have Been Temporarily Detained</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since Zhang Weicun was assassinated on the evening of the 2nd, Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, immediately ordered the military police to strictly apprehend the murderer. For several days, there has been no progress. Han believed that Zhang had some disputes with party members before his death, and Zhang also served as a Director of Anti-Communist Special Commissioner and worked in the Special Affairs Office (i.e., the Communist Arrest Team). Thus, it was necessary to pay attention to the Special Affairs Office staff. At 9 a.m. today (the 7th), Han, in his capacity as a Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, led two companies of pistol troops to the Provincial Party Headquarters. Those accompanying him included Wang Shiqi, Director of the Jinan Public Security Bureau, Shi Jingzhou, Director of the Military Law Department of the Headquarters, Lei Taiping, Adjutant General, and Yu Fengjun, Battalion Commander of the Pistol Brigade. They guarded the gates of the Provincial Party Headquarters, the doors of all offices, and the telephone room, prohibiting entry and exit and cutting off communication. Then, they summoned all staff members to give a speech in the auditorium, stating, "Fellow comrades, today is the first time I have met you all in the 24th year of the Republic. Looking back at everything that has happened in the past 23 years, although I personally hold the position of Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, I also rely on everyone's efforts. Therefore, although I dare not say that all achievements are good, they are generally acceptable. Unfortunately, something like what happened to Comrade Zhang has occurred, and I believe everyone is very sad and heartbroken. Since I took office as Chairman in the 19th year, I have a nature that is not good at socializing, and I do not know many people in this province. I am also a soldier with limited political ability. However, I am confident that I stand on the people's side and act entirely in the interests of the country. Regardless of which civil servant, as long as I see them as working hard for local affairs, I want to bring them together to work. I am not necessarily looking for anyone in particular to do it. I hope all comrades will continue their past efforts and add even more effort. As for Comrade Zhang's matter, it came suddenly, and we must express our feelings in order to show everyone's sincerity. Today, we must inspect everyone who has family members to see if there are any firearms or suspicious documents. I think everyone has been with Comrade Zhang for a long time, and it does not seem that there would be any ill feelings. However, there are many external discussions, and I have received many reports and letters in recent days, so it is necessary to inspect. This matter appears to have happened suddenly, but in fact, it was done by a portion of people, not just one or two people, and it must have taken one or two months of planning and a lot of thought. It is easy to find the traces, so it should not be difficult to solve." He immediately asked Zhan Juncen, the Director of the Special Affairs Team, how many people were in the Communist Arrest Team and whether they had guns. Zhan reported that there were eleven team members in total, two of whom were on leave. The team had no guns, and when they needed guns, they asked Zhang Weicun for them, because he was the Anti-Communist Special Commissioner. Next, Li Wenzhai, a Standing Committee Member, gave a speech, stating, "Comrade Zhang Weicun has been very diligent in the past for the central government and the local area. Unfortunately, he lost his life. We feel very helpless about the Party Headquarters' affairs. No matter what, we must continue to do what Comrade Zhang himself did or what he helped the government do, and we must help the government solve the case and pay attention to everyone's words, actions, and attitudes at all times. As for the Party Headquarters itself, we will never lightly trust anyone or handle anything lightly in the future. Everything must be discussed with Chairman Han." After the speeches, he ordered everyone present to write down their addresses. Anyone who had firearms or keys also handed them over at the same time. Han then sent Wang Shiqi, Shi Jingzhou, Lei Taiping, Yu Fengjun, etc. to search each house according to the addresses, while also inspecting inside the Provincial Party Headquarters. Han also studied methods with Li Wenzhai, Zhang Zhuxi, and others in the Standing Committee office. It is said that Zhan Juncen, Director of the Special Affairs Team, had conflicts with Zhang Weicun over authority and finance in the past. The central government sent someone to Jinan to mediate, so Han paid close attention to Zhan. While Han inspected each staff member, he also prepared ten tables of banquets to entertain them. Regarding those who had firearms, Li Wenzhai had one, which was taken out of his house. Qin Qirong, an Executive Committee Member, had one, but it was not found in his house. Later, Qin's gun was taken out from the house of a teacher named Sun at Zhengyi Middle School. Liu Xinwo, an alternate Executive Committee Member, had one, but his wife, having heard the news in advance, took the gun elsewhere out of fear, and it was not found. Zhan Juncen initially said he had one, but his family said he had two, but he handed over one (with one bullet still in the gun). The other one was beside a Special Affairs Team member named Xu Xiandeng, who later handed over the gun. In total, four guns were obtained. Also, eighty-two bullets (three full boxes of seventy-five and seven loose) were found in Zhan Juncen's home, which were the same as the bullets found beside Zhang Weicun after his death, which is noteworthy. However, according to Zhan, the central government had previously sent three notices instructing Zhang Weicun to pay attention and guard against communist assassinations. Zhang Weicun had also seen these notices, but unfortunately, he did not take precautions, which led to this disaster. Also, Li Zijia, a County Magistrate Training Class member, said he had a gun, but when they went to his house to look for it, his family said that the gun was at his home in Anhui. Because Li was on good terms with Zhang Weicun before his death, his mind was sometimes confused, and he just said it casually, but the gun was not actually in Jinan. After the inspection, all firearms, bullets, letters, etc. were first transported to the Military Law Department of the Headquarters. Han Fuqu went to the auditorium to report to all staff members about the inspection process, stating, "The evil trend of assassination should never be allowed to start. Moreover, Comrade Zhang held three important positions as a Central Committee Member, a Provincial Executive Committee Member, and a member of the Provincial Government. After being assassinated, the whole country is paying attention. If the case is not solved quickly, it would be too outrageous. I have no confidence in how far this case will go in the future, but we must work hard to handle it. Anyone who is slightly suspicious must be investigated, because without doing so, the case cannot be solved. I personally have too little experience in party affairs and am too busy. I have done too little to fulfill my responsibilities to the party in the past. Now that this incident has occurred, and I have been appointed as a Standing Committee Member, I cannot continue as before. In the future, all documents and matters must be notified to me by the secretariat every Tuesday and Friday. Otherwise, no matter will be allowed to proceed." After the report, he ordered those with firearms and members of the Special Affairs Team to be sent to the Military Law Department and the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention, respectively. The remaining personnel were allowed to return home, and he returned to the Provincial Government, by which time it was already 4:30 p.m. In the evening, he interrogated those involved and sent Shi Jingzhou, Director of the Military Law Department, Sun Xifeng, Deputy Director, and others to inspect the letters found in various places. The temporarily detained personnel, Li Wenzhai, Qin Qirong, and Liu Xinwo, were treated very well in the Jinan Public Security Bureau. Zhan Juncen, Director of the Special Affairs Team, and team members Wang Buyun, Tong Meng, Xu Xiandeng, Li Zhiying, Tang Heting, Ma Dewen, Cao Zhongsan, and Ma Zongying, were at the Military Law Department. The team members on leave, Xu Yiming and Ji Qingyuan, were not present. Gao Yunqing, Xu Zicai, and Zhang Yunxian were being summoned for interrogation separately. (7th)</p>
<p>Further Interrogation: After searching the homes of party members on the 7th in connection with the assassination of Zhang Weicun, Li Wenzhai, a Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Qin Qirong, an Executive Committee Member, and Liu Xinwo, an Alternate Executive Committee Member, were temporarily detained at the Public Security Bureau, while Zhan Juncen, Director of the Special Affairs Office, and twelve others were taken to the Military Law Department. Li, Qin, and the others were treated very well at the Public Security Bureau and had not yet been questioned. Zhan Juncen was questioned in detail one by one after arriving at the Military Law Department on the 7th, and it is said that there were many suspicious points that could be studied. At 6 a.m. yesterday (the 8th), Han Fuqu ordered Liu Shuxiang, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Wang Shiqi, Director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, Sun Baofeng, Deputy Director of the Military Law Department of the Third Route Army, and Liu Yaoting, Captain of the Special Investigation Team, to be responsible for investigating the entire case. After receiving the order, Liu and others began interrogating Zhan Juncen and his team members Wang Buyun, Tong Meng, Xu Xiandeng, Li Zhiying, Tang Heting, Ma Dewen, Cao Zhongsan, Ma Zongying, Gao Yunqing, Xu Zicai, and Zhang Yunxian in the Staff Office from 9 a.m. yesterday (the 8th), took a break for lunch at 12 p.m., continued the interrogation at 1 p.m., and took a break for dinner at 5 p.m. After dinner, they continued the interrogation and also brought in a deaf person for questioning. All the confessions cannot be published because the case is important. However, regarding Zhan Juncen, there are several points that can be studied: (1) Zhan had clashed with Zhang Weicun several times last year (because Zhang was the Anti-Communist Special Commissioner and Zhan was the Director of the Special Affairs Office). The central government sent Liu to Jinan to mediate and allocate authority and finance. Zhan had returned to Nanjing once during this period. (2) Zhan's gun and bullets were the same caliber as the bullets that assassinated Zhang. Even if the caliber is the same, it is not enough to prove anything. However, Zhan's gun had fresh gunpowder residue, proving that it had been recently used, and there was only one bullet at the top of the chamber. According to Zhan's gun, it was a Browning eight-sound pistol. It can also be proved from the bullet casings that assassinated Zhang that the gun used to assassinate Zhang was an eight-sound pistol. Zhang was shot five times and an attendant was shot once, a total of six bullets. Although an eight-sound gun can hold eight bullets, an average of seven bullets are loaded. Also, when Zhan was initially questioned at the Provincial Party Headquarters on the 7th, he said that the Special Affairs Office had no guns and had to ask Zhang Weicun for them when they needed them. When an order was issued for an inspection, he stated that he had one gun. When checking his house, his family said there were two guns. As a result, one gun was found in his house and another gun was found in the Special Affairs Office. (3) Zhan initially said that there were eleven Special Affairs Team members, but later changed it to fourteen. Also, Zhang was assassinated on January 2nd, but Ji Qingyuan and Xu Yiming happened to take leave and return to the south on December 29th and 31st, respectively. They have not returned even after their leave has expired. Ji and Xu came from Nanjing with Zhan. Zhan claimed that at the time of the incident, he was watching a play at the Oriental Theater in the commercial district with Special Affairs Team members Tong Meng, Xu Xiandeng, and Wang Leyun. Wang and Tong also came from Nanjing with Zhan.</p>
<p>The above are the suspicious points seen by the interrogators. It is still unknown what evidence Zhan has to refute them. In short, Zhang's case is still under investigation and a definite judgment cannot be made. (9th)</p>
<h3>Philippine House of Representatives Passes Retail Trade Restriction Act</h3>
<p>Foreign Retailers Required to Close Down</p>
<p>A Major Blow to Overseas Chinese in the Philippines</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: There are more than 140,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, most of whom are engaged in business, especially retailers, who occupy a very dominant position and almost control the Philippine market. Filipinos cannot compete, so there has long been a proposal to restrict retailers and prevent foreigners from engaging in the retail business. Recently, Philippine Congressman Li Aokeluo proposed a bill to restrict foreign retailers, which has been passed by the House of Representatives. The original bill stipulates that retailers in the country must have at least 75 percent of their capital owned by Filipinos or Americans in order to operate. Existing foreign retail businesses must close down by December 31, 1936. If this bill is passed by the Philippine Senate and approved by the Philippine Governor-General, it will become law and will be a major blow to our overseas Chinese retailers in the Philippines. The original bill is translated as follows: Article 1: Only American and Filipino citizens have the right to engage in retail business in the Philippines. No foreigner may engage in retail business in the Philippines. If it is a joint venture established by shareholders, at least 75 percent of the shares must be owned by Americans and Filipinos in order to be allowed to operate. Article 2: Foreign stores currently engaged in retail business in the Philippines may continue to open and sell goods until the store's inventory is exhausted after the implementation of this bill, but the period shall not exceed December 31, 1936. Article 3: Any foreigner engaged in retail business who does not comply with the provisions of Article 1 shall be deemed to be in violation of the law and shall be subject to imprisonment for one to three years. Article 4: This bill shall take effect from the date of its approval. (7th)</p>
<h3>Xu Fu Inspects the Finances of Various Counties in Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>Invited by Jiang Dingwen to Plan the Reconstruction of Bandit Areas</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Xu Fu, a member of the Fujian Provincial Government, Director of Finance, and Special Commissioner of Fujian Finance, came to Xiamen from the province with Pacification Director Jiang Dingwen and arrived here on the 4th. Xu's mission is: (1) to inspect the finances of various counties in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in southern Fujian; (2) to negotiate the promotion and sale of short-term provincial bonds; (3) to investigate old debts owed by the provincial government. It is scheduled to go to Zhangzhou with Jiang today (the 7th). Whether to go to western Fujian for inspection will be decided upon arrival in Zhangzhou. If time is limited, they will return to the province by land from Quanzhou. According to Li Yushu, Xu's attendant, Xu's trip was at the invitation of Director Jiang to go south together. Because the reconstruction, transportation, finance, and post-disaster relief in the areas recovered from bandits need to be organized and planned, it is necessary to personally inspect and consult with local people. Although the province's finances are currently extremely stretched, military and political expenses can still be maintained completely. Xu manages the province's finances based on income and expenditure, and on the one hand, he reduces expenditures and increases revenue, so he can cope with ease and there is no so-called year-end difficulty. The current issuance of 900,000 provincial short-term bonds is a type of very short-term marketable securities with a term of nine months, and the principal and interest are repaid monthly, using the province's slaughter tax as collateral. It has been passed by the Legislative Yuan and has a very short term and collateral. Merchants can use it as marketable securities to borrow cash from banks. As for investigating the debts accumulated by previous finance directors of the provincial government, although there is currently a proposal, it is still a second step issue. (7th)</p>

<h3>Korean Couple, Suspected Drug Dealers, Murdered in Beiping, Leading to Retaliatory Attack</h3>
<p>Numerous Koreans Assault Chinese Police Officers That Night</p>
<p>Military Police Impose Temporary Martial Law in the Eastern District</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: A murder case involving Koreans occurred here this morning, followed by an incident in the evening where numerous Koreans rioted at a police station and assaulted Chinese police officers. Details of both incidents are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Zhuxing, a 38-year-old Korean, and his wife, Ms. Jin, had been living in Beiping for eight years. They rented a house at No. 8 Dalian Keng, using it as a hub for their drug trafficking business. Each room had a pit dug in the ground, allowing heroin customers to secretly hide and consume drugs. Nightly, the traffic in and out never ceased, disturbing the neighborhood and drawing the attention of the police, yet nothing could be done about it. This morning (the 7th) at 7 a.m., Bai Fengshan, a patrol officer from the 12th section of the Third Inner District, was patrolling in front of their door when he suddenly noticed blood flowing from under the doorway. He pushed the door open and saw a corpse lying in the doorway, the face covered in blood. He immediately called the district office, and the director led a team to the scene. They identified the deceased as Zhang Zhuxing, with five axe wounds to the head. Simultaneously, the body of a woman was found in the main room, with multiple axe wounds to the upper body. Two young children were beside the bodies, crying in anguish. In the afternoon, the Public Security Bureau and the court sent personnel to inspect the scene. Bow Ye Liman (transliteration), the head of the Japanese police station (Japanese), also led a team to the scene and even obstructed our court's inspection. Our detective personnel are secretly investigating the truth. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon of the same day, another incident occurred where Koreans assaulted police officers. At around 9 p.m. tonight (the 7th), about fifty or sixty Koreans suddenly arrived at the 12th section police station of the Third Inner District. They stormed into the police station, without saying a word, and indiscriminately smashed everything inside. Telephone and electric light wires were completely cut, and all official documents and records were torn to pieces. Our police officers did not resist and all fled. The head of the patrol officer, An Quanyu (transliteration), was severely injured in the head by the Koreans amidst the chaos and was sent to the hospital for treatment. His life is in danger. Unexpectedly, after the Koreans finished rioting, they marched through the streets in formation, shouting wildly, as if looking for trouble. As a result, the residents of the district closed their doors and warned each other not to go out. For a time, the atmosphere in the eastern district was tense. Our authorities urgently telegraphed various agencies, gathered military police, and detectives, and imposed temporary martial law to inspect idlers and cut off traffic on the streets near the Third Inner District to maintain order. On the one hand, the highest responsible authorities notified the Japanese Embassy's police department, requesting them to send personnel to contact the Koreans to inquire about their intentions so that they could negotiate and cooperate to stop them. As of the time of this report, this riotous spectacle had not been resolved. Whether it is related to the murder case of the Korean in the morning and what the connection is, the truth is still difficult to understand. (7th)</p>
<h3>Refugees from Jiang and Song Regions Seeking Food in Songjiang</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, drought has ravaged the land, causing severe crop failures in the Zhejiang-Jiaxing area. Some farmers have even experienced total loss of harvest, leading to widespread poverty and desperation. Driven by hunger, people are fleeing their homes with the elderly and young in tow, seeking food in other areas. Recently, refugees from places like Xiashe and Wangdian in Zhejiang-Jiaxing have been arriving in boats, heading towards Qiaoxian County. Hundreds of refugees are lingering around the Jiting, Jiangcang Bridge area in the western suburbs of this city. The county magistrate, Jin Tigan, has initiated relief efforts, collecting donations, and the director of the relief institute, Li Zuhua, along with District Chief Li, are personally distributing aid in the western suburbs, providing each person with one "sheng" of white rice and 200 "wen". The refugees are currently staying in places like the Sanyuan Temple. It is said that the amount distributed has already reached over one hundred yuan. Some are advocating for the establishment of a shelter to fulfill the neighborly duty of disaster relief. Additionally, refugees from Lianshui and Huoqiu counties are passing through this area daily in a continuous stream. The police station is dispatching officers to escort them out of the region.</p>
<h3>Opium Addicts Escape from Opium Detoxification Center</h3>
<p>Feng Youlu, the director of the county's opium detoxification center, has been managing it for several months, establishing a structured program. Many opium addicts arrested in various townships and districts have been sent to the center for compulsory detoxification. However, on the night of the 9th (yesterday) at around 2 a.m., three opium addicts undergoing detoxification, Gu Fushou, Zhang Zhisan, and Wu Fusheng, escaped from the center. Their whereabouts are currently unknown. Director Feng has submitted a report to the Opium Prohibition Committee, requesting their capture.</p>
<h3>Dingjia County Issues Arrest Warrants for Six Former County Magistrates</h3>
<p>The provincial government has issued arrest warrants for four former county magistrates of this county, Ma Shaozhou, Chen Chichang, Chen Can, and Shen Tingqi, because their handover of duties was incomplete. Two others, Wu Bogeng and Xing Nan, although they completed the handover, still owe money: Wu owes 3,319 yuan and some change, and Xing owes 1,121 yuan and some change. Despite repeated notices and overdue deadlines, they have ignored the demands and disappeared without a trace. The previous year, a request was submitted to the Executive Yuan to issue arrest warrants for these officials and to confiscate their properties to cover the debts. The Executive Yuan has approved the request and consulted the Judicial Yuan, instructing the Ministry of Judicial Administration to order the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office to instruct its subordinates to comply.</p>
<p>The Weather in Wuxi is Warm, and Business is Sluggish</p>
<p>In the city, for the past two months, the weather has been warm, with the Fahrenheit thermometer consistently reading between 55 and 56 degrees. This has caused plants to behave abnormally, with bean sprouts flowering out of season. In previous years, business in this period would have already started to improve. However, this year, due to the warm weather and tight credit, commerce has plummeted, with businesses experiencing very few customers, which is unprecedented in recent years. Nevertheless, pre-arranged payments and debts are due on schedule, causing everyone to feel financially strained and unable to close down their businesses.</p>
<h3>Provincial Commissioner Arrives in Wuxi to Inspect Land Tax</h3>
<p>Zhao Dihua, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, recently sent Liu Zhiban, the Head of the First Section, to inspect various counties due to the confusing land tax situation, inconsistent tax rates and regulations, and varying collection procedures. The purpose is to rectify and improve the system. After being dispatched, Liu arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday and went directly to the county government to meet with Magistrate Yan, inquiring about the political situation. Subsequently, accompanied by Fei Yunong, the Head of the Second Section, Zhu Kaiguan, the Land Tax Director, and Wang Guangyi, the supervising committee member, Liu visited the promotion and collection office for inspection. He then proceeded to inspect the land tax, register, and grain storage offices, and reviewed the prepared tax registration papers. He discovered significant errors and instructed Head Fei to correct them immediately. However, Head Fei explained that the tax registration papers had already been completed, sent for printing, and were scheduled for urgent distribution to complete the tax collection. If corrections were made, the papers would have to be re-edited, which would waste time and require additional expenses, making it difficult to implement. Therefore, he obtained Magistrate Yan's approval to travel to the provincial capital yesterday to request instructions and seek leniency. As a result, the Department of Finance agreed to allow the addition of a stamp on the completed tax registration papers, explaining the deductions. Satisfied with the outcome, Fei returned to the county that evening.</p>
<h3>Changshu Party and Government Agencies Hold Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 9th at 2 p.m., various Party and government agencies in the county held a discussion meeting at the county Party headquarters. More than ten leaders from Party and government agencies attended. Wu Ying, the Party Secretary, presided over the meeting, and the following key issues were resolved: (1) It was decided that in the future, Party and government agencies would consult with each other on handling cases involving people's organizations to avoid inconsistencies. (2) The Party and government agencies will jointly organize a charity guidance committee, with the county Party headquarters drafting detailed regulations. (3) The Cotton Yarn Industry Association has insufficient members and does not meet the basic requirements, so its activities should be suspended, and the Party headquarters will send personnel to take over its management. (4) A discussion meeting will be convened with those in charge of the fire brigades in the urban area to discuss improvements in fire control. (5) Regulations for end-of-year good behavior will be established and handled by the New Life Movement Promotion Association.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Submits Proposal to Provincial Government to Open City Gate</h3>
<p>For the convenience of transportation in the western part of Wuyi County, the county government plans to open a Jingyun Gate in the city wall south of Xiaoshuiguan at the Zhijifang bottom and build a Liufang Bridge outside the city to connect to Taiping Lane outside the West Gate, directly reaching Xinma Road. This would connect with the Zhencheng and Wuyi highways. The Head of the Third Section, Li Jiaji, rushed to prepare the drawings and budget to submit to the Department of Construction for approval. It is rumored that opening the Jingyun Gate will cost approximately over a thousand yuan, which the county government will raise. The funds for building the Liufang Bridge will be raised by local gentry such as Zhuang Zhongxi.</p>
<h3>Yanshui and Alcohol License Tax Branch Chief Detained</h3>
<p>Zhao Qian, the Branch Chief of the Yanshui and Alcohol License Tax Bureau of Wuyi, Yixing, Xishui, and Yinxian Counties (also known as Zhu Jian, also known as Jinzhang), was discovered by Xie Rentao and others dispatched by the Provincial Bureau at the Changzhou Station on the 8th and immediately taken to the county government for detention. It is rumored that the reason for the detention is that he has been repeatedly accused of using a false name, illegally levying excessive taxes, and failing to remit tax funds. Currently, over six thousand yuan of the autumn tax has been handed over to the Provincial Department. Zhu has requested bail, but the Provincial Bureau must submit a request to the Department of Finance for approval.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu-Zhenjiang to Develop Irrigation in Cultivation Area</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province considers the area east of Chanchang River and west of the New Canal as cultivation zone, covering an area of 8,100 square kilometers, equivalent to approximately 13 million mu. Because the area is prone to flooding when the Huai River flows in, taking months to recede, and prone to drought when water sources dry up and saltwater tides flow backward, disasters are frequent. In the past, there were plans to develop the New Canal to seek relief. However, due to the difficult state treasury, it has not been realized. Recently, there are plans to develop irrigation in the cultivation zone. In addition to developing a new canal east of Chanchang River, running north and south for regulation, it is also planned to use the excavated soil to build a large dam on the east bank of the New Canal to prevent the intrusion of sea tides. At the same time, it is planned to build a main road on the west bank to facilitate land transportation, and to dredge ditches west of the New Canal, connecting to Chanchang River to receive water. Canals will be dug east of the New Canal, extending to Xiangkou to facilitate drainage, and sluice gates will be built as appropriate for easy operation. The total cost is estimated at approximately 6.5 million yuan, and planning and preparations are actively underway.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Education Bureau Investigates Embezzlement of Loan Certificates</h3>
<p>Jiangdu issued 60,000 yuan of educational loan certificates in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), drawing lots six times in succession, and repaying the principal and interest according to the drawn numbers. Currently, the certificate guarantee committee, because the fund is adequate, has specially changed the original plan of repaying in eight installments to a full repayment. The seventh draw will not take place. However, during the drafting of the full repayment plan, it was discovered that there were cases of only collecting the stamp and not issuing the loan certificate. People in the education sector recalled that during the sixth academic lottery, a delivery worker went to the bureau with a 500-yuan loan certificate to have it stamped, but the bureau suspected that the certificate was questionable and did not stamp it or investigate further. Now that the end is approaching, there are again cases of collecting the stamp but not having the certificate, which is related to the reputation of the education sector and must be investigated. Therefore, it is planned to form an investigation committee to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Suspect in the Shi Liangcai Case Interrogated Yesterday in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Zhang Wentian, the suspect in the assassination of Mr. Shi Liangcai, was escorted from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the evening of the 8th. Yesterday morning (the 9th) at 9 a.m., Chen Huaming, the prosecutor of the Hangzhou County District Court, opened the trial. The police were ordered to bring the suspect Zhang forward and present a leather bag as evidence. After the prosecutor inquired about his age and origin, he investigated the details of the Shi case in detail. Zhang absolutely denied the matter, claiming complete ignorance and that he had never been to Hangzhou. He admitted that the leather bag belonged to him. The interrogation lasted until around 10 a.m., after which he was ordered to be taken to the detention center for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Bandits from Haining Arrested in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Yu Shunliu, a notorious bandit who has committed multiple crimes in Haining and other counties, was hiding at No. 124 Shijiguan Lane in this city. The joint defense investigation team of the four counties discovered his location and dispatched team members Mao Liheng and Liu Xiang to arrest him at the address and send him to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiashan Jiashing Shareholders Clear Outstanding Deposits</h3>
<p>The Jiashan Commercial Savings Bank, affected by deposit withdrawals, declared liquidation. Depositors pointed out that the bank's original capital was 500,000 yuan, but only one-quarter of the shares (125,000 yuan) had been paid. Therefore, the creditors' association jointly filed a complaint with the Ministry of Finance. The ministry consulted the Zhejiang Provincial Government, instructing the county to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and supervise the liquidation. Now, after receiving a complaint from Xia Weiji and others, the Ministry of Finance issued a directive yesterday, stating that since the bank has publicly announced its liquidation and set a date for repaying debts, it should collect the outstanding capital in full amount within a specified period of time, according to the total capital amount, and liquidate it according to law. The savings deposits should be repaid in full, including principal and interest, according to the current regulations of the Savings Bank Law, with the bank's directors and supervisors jointly and severally liable without limitation, in order to comply with the law and protect the rights of creditors. In addition to the directive, the Ministry of Finance also consulted the Zhejiang Provincial Government to forward it to the Jiashan County Government for handling and requested that the handling situation be reported to the ministry for verification.</p>

<h3>A Review of the World Economy in 1934 (Continued) - Mu Ouchu</h3>
<p>The prosperity of the fuel and electrical industries further proves the development of the military industry. Fuel is mainly coal and kerosene. The world coal production in the first half of 1934 is listed as follows:</p>
<p>World Coal Production (Unit: 1,000 tons)</p>
<p>First Half of 1932: 449,530</p>
<p>Second Half of 1932: 460,791</p>
<p>First Half of 1933: 448,910</p>
<p>Second Half of 1933: 501,515</p>
<p>January 1934: 94,315</p>
<p>February 1934: 88,202</p>
<p>March 1934: 98,683</p>
<p>April 1934: 80,439</p>
<p>May 1934: 83,499</p>
<p>June 1934: 80,525</p>
<p>Total for First Half: 525,563</p>
<p>(Source: League of Nations Survey)</p>
<p>Although the coal production in the first half of 1934 showed a slight recovery compared to the previous two years, it was still lower than the production of 1.3 billion tons in 1929. However, this does not mean that fuel consumption decreased, because kerosene is gradually replacing coal. Although statistics on world kerosene production in 1934 have not been found, 1933 already had a new record. Kerosene production in 1934 was certainly not lower than the previous year but had an increasing trend. The comparison of kerosene production in the past 20 years is as follows:</p>
<p>(Source: British Petroleum Association Survey, Unit: Million Tons)</p>
<p>1913: 53.7</p>
<p>1928: 124.2</p>
<p>1929: 206.7</p>
<p>1930: 196.8</p>
<p>1931: 189.7</p>
<p>1932: 179.3</p>
<p>1933: 194.3</p>
<p>Among the driving forces, due to electrification, all countries are striving to develop power. Therefore, the increase in the production and consumption of electricity can also prove the development of the military industry. In the United States, the first half of 1934 increased compared to the previous two years. U.S. Electricity Production and Consumption Index</p>
<p>Monthly Average Production Consumption</p>
<p>1932 70.9 87.5</p>
<p>1933 84.9 87.5</p>
<p>1934 94.1 107.1</p>
<p>(Source: League of Nations Survey, the consumption index is based on the average of 1923-1925 as 100, and the production index is based on the estimated level as 100. Because the standards are different, the comparison of growth and decline cannot be made. Only the production and consumption can be compared separately.)</p>
<p>Shipping Industry: Due to the shrinkage of international trade in the past few years, the shipping industry in various countries has gradually declined. However, in the second half of 1933, it gradually showed signs of improvement. In 1934, this phenomenon continued to be maintained. The statistics of the number of ships under construction in the world in 1934 was 1,079,100 tons, an increase of 321,800 tons compared to the end of 1933. The increase rate was the largest in the United States. Last year, it increased about twice as much as the same period last year. At the end of March of the year before last, there were only 252,000 tons, but this year it has increased to 481,000 tons, accounting for almost half of the world's total. Except for England, the rest of the world is 597,000 tons; among them, Japan also increased by 16,000 tons in March last year compared with the same period last year, and other countries such as Germany, France, the United States, and the Netherlands also had considerable increases.</p>
<p>Automobile Industry: In 1933, the world's production volume was already considerable. In 1932, the world produced a total of 1,977,000 vehicles, and in 1933 it increased to 2,672,000 vehicles. The United States alone increased by 588,000 vehicles in one year (League of Nations Survey). After the start of 1934, it increased even more sharply. In the first three months alone, the United States produced 732,100 vehicles, an increase of about 60% compared to the same period last year. The production volume of British automobiles surprisingly broke the unprecedented record in 1933, reaching 286,000 vehicles; the Soviet Union produced a total of 16,073 vehicles in the first half of 1934, which also showed a clear increase compared to the same period last year. (Cultural Construction, Volume 1, Issue 3, pages 78)</p>
<p>The structure of automobiles has the latest equipment, which can be quickly converted into tanks. This is worth noting. Although we cannot deny that the transportation industry has made considerable progress in 1934, it is undeniable that the development of the automobile industry is mostly for the preparation of war.</p>
<p>According to the general principles of economics, increased production must be accompanied by increased trade. However, the world trade in 1934 was inversely proportional to world production, which can also prove that the contradiction between production and consumption has not disappeared at all. The comparison of world trade in the first half of 1934 with the previous two years is as follows:</p>
<p>Import Export</p>
<p>First Half of 1932 6,661 5,841</p>
<p>Second Half of 1932 6,195 5,415</p>
<p>First Half of 1933 5,950 5,415</p>
<p>Second Half of 1933 6,035 5,762</p>
<p>January 1934 983 895</p>
<p>February 1934 898 855</p>
<p>March 1934 1,001 961</p>
<p>April 1934 955 847</p>
<p>May 1934 981 874</p>
<p>June 1934 959 879</p>
<p>July 1934 896 838</p>
<p>(Unit: Million Gold Dollars, League of Nations Survey)</p>
<p>The import in the first half of 1934 was about 5.8 billion gold dollars, and the export was about 5.3 billion gold dollars, both showing a reduction. This is in terms of the world. As for the countries, there are quite different points. The foreign trade of the major countries is listed as follows:</p>
<p>1932 1933 1934</p>
<p>First Half Second Half First Half Second Half First Half</p>
<p>UK Million Pounds Export 216 200 200 216 219</p>
<p>Import 361 341 320 356 362</p>
<p>Germany Million Marks Export 2,989 2,751 2,378 2,494 2,086</p>
<p>Import 2,386 2,280 2,087 2,117 2,302</p>
<p>France Million Francs Export 10,080 9,625 8,966 9,468 8,800</p>
<p>Import 15,236 14,572 15,108 12,317 12,614</p>
<p>Italy Million Lira Export 3,471 3,342 3,854 2,854 2,642</p>
<p>Import 4,727 3,531 3,919 3,494 4,067</p>
<p>US Million Gold Dollars Export 840 771 669 1,006 1,037</p>
<p>Import 747 676 592 857 863</p>
<p>Japan Million Yen Export 550 860 830 1,031 1,003</p>
<p>Import 817 615 1,016 901 1,159</p>
<p>India Million Rupees Export 711 687 772 763 772</p>
<p>Import 589 647 606 572 611</p>
<p>Soviet Union Million Gold Rubles Export 275 289 224 282 144</p>
<p>Import 405 293 191 163 91</p>
<p>(Source: Japanese News Agency, "Where is the World Going", Second Half of 1934, page 84)</p>
<p>The decrease in exports from Germany, France, and Italy is a sacrifice for maintaining the value of currencies in the gold standard countries, while the import and export of countries that implement currency inflation, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, are gradually increasing. Therefore, the gold standard countries are more self-conscious. At the same time, we can see the sharpening of the confrontation between the powers. This sharpening is the fuse of the Second World War.</p>
<p>The development of economic panic not only caused panic in agriculture and industry at the same time, but also intertwined the two, making the panic enter a dangerous situation. The panic that occurred in 1929 was the prelude to the intertwining of the two; this panic continued until 1934.</p>
<p>Agricultural production in 1934 did not improve, although it had a great relationship with unfavorable climate, but most of it was due to the agricultural panic. The production of major raw materials is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Raw Silk Wool</p>
<p>Thousand Bales Bales Million Pounds</p>
<p>1925-1926 26,580 579,123 3,022</p>
<p>1926-1927 27,804 657,583 3,383</p>
<p>1927-1928 23,307 678,861 3,346</p>
<p>1928-1929 25,670 726,618 3,376</p>
<p>1929-1930 26,597 778,816 3,347</p>
<p>1930-1931 25,190 702,919 3,282</p>
<p>1931-1932 26,535 609,270 3,313</p>
<p>1932-1933 23,585 630,672 3,268</p>
<p>1933-1934 25,361 591,390 3,122</p>
<p>1934-1935 (Estimate) 22,367</p>
<p>Investigators: New York Cotton Exchange Japanese Textile Association British Dal</p>
<p>glez Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The production of raw silk and wool in 1933 decreased compared to the previous year. The estimate for 1934 should be even more reduced. The production of wheat and other items is also very sluggish. The production of wheat, sugar, and rubber in the past four years is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Wheat Sugar Rubber</p>
<p>Million Bushels Thousand Tons</p>
<p>1931 3,847 28,477</p>
<p>1932 3,822 26,377</p>
<p>1933 3,805 24,141</p>
<p>1934 (Estimate) 3,613 25,569</p>
<p>There are international production reduction agreements on sugar production, but there is still an increasing phenomenon. An international production reduction agreement was also established on rubber on April 29, 1934, restricting the global production volume to no more than 1,019,000 tons. After June, there was a certain ratio to gradually reduce production to avoid the risk of overproduction. The production reduction agreement is a last resort during the panic period. The fact that this phenomenon occurred in 1934 clearly shows that 1934 was still in the deep vortex of panic.</p>
<p>Agricultural panic can also be proven by the drop in agricultural product prices. For example, the drop in orchid prices in Japan is very impressive.</p>
<p>1934 1933</p>
<p>White Orchid (Per Guan) 3.09 Yuan 5.57 Yuan</p>
<p>Yellow Orchid (Per Guan) 3.26 Yuan 5.41 Yuan</p>
<p>(Source: Japanese 1935 Transformation Yearbook, page 211)</p>
<p>This is still the highest price. For example, the ordinary price of Yellow Orchid is about 2.5 Yuan, which is almost half of the previous year. From this, one can imagine how difficult the lives of Japanese farmers who raise silkworms for a living are. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Visited Sun Ke Yesterday to Discuss</h3>
<p>Sun: There is Absolutely No Problem with National Unity</p>
<p>Hu Hope: The Central Government Fully Accepts Three Points</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, went to Peiping a few days ago to visit his wife, Ms. Chen Shuying. He completed his trip and returned to Nanjing the day before yesterday. That evening at 11 p.m., accompanied by Kong Xiangxi, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, Yang Yongtai, the Secretary-General of the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters, and legislators Fu Bingchang, Wu Shangying, and Chen Jianru, he took the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai. At 7:15 a.m. yesterday, he arrived at the Zhenru Station and returned to his private residence to rest. Member of the Central Executive Committee, Wang Chonghui, visited Sun at around 9 a.m. to discuss the issue of unity. Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang stationed in Nanjing, was also present during the meeting, which lasted until about 11:30 a.m. Sun then came out to meet with reporters and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3>There is Absolutely No Problem with National Unity</h3>
<p>According to Sun, there is absolutely no problem with national unity at present. The three points that Mr. Hu Zhantang hopes from the central government have been fully accepted by the central government, and two of them have already been put into practice. As for whether Mr. Hu will come to Shanghai or go to Nanjing, it is Mr. Hu's personal freedom to decide. The date of his arrival in the north is also up to Mr. Hu to decide. It is not a major issue. If our country is not united, it will not be able to deal with foreign enemies. Therefore, national unity is unfavorable to the enemy, who spares no effort to spread rumors and sow discord. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will not be fooled by them.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui's Trip Abroad is Still Pending</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Zhantang specially sent Mr. Li Xiaosheng to Shanghai a few days ago to meet with Dr. Wang Chonghui and inspect the situation here. He completed his mission on the 9th and left Shanghai to return to Hong Kong and report back. Dr. Wang Chonghui must wait until Mr. Li arrives in Hong Kong to see what Mr. Hu's opinions are before relaying them to the central government.

Regarding the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee's purchase and shipment of twenty million yuan of silver from Hong Kong to Shanghai to regulate finance and stabilize the market, Kong acknowledged that the matter was indeed true. He stated that the silver had indeed been purchased from Hong Kong but, due to the large quantity, the shipping procedures must be handled with utmost care. It should be shipped to Shanghai within days. Regarding the silver issue, Kong was unwilling to comment. When asked about rumors that Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji had made two demands to the US government regarding silver, namely (1) that the US government cease raising the price of silver and (2) that the US government stop purchasing silver using current methods, Kong solemnly denied them. He stated that the government has appropriate measures to stabilize finance and would not need to make demands to the United States. The aforementioned rumors are entirely unfounded.</p>

<h3>Powell Lectures on the Recent Situations of Russia and Japan</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Press, Mr. Powell, editor of the China Weekly Review, recently traveled to Japan, Northeast China, and Soviet Russia. Yesterday afternoon (the 9th), at the Bankers' Association, he shared his observations from his travels with members and friends of the China International Problems Research Association. He stated that Japan is in a state of political anxiety and hesitation, while Soviet Russia is engaged in the orderly development of heavy industry, building a railway network, and pushing its military bases towards Vladivostok in order to seize economic hegemony on its far eastern border. However, it is still striving for peace, as its purpose is to defend its Pacific coast. Japan's anxiety stems from a deep belief that in a future Far Eastern war, the United States and Russia will form an economic alliance to resist Japan, and that both countries are hidden dangers for Japan. Therefore, it adopts a tough, unpredictable attitude towards Russia, the United States, and China. In recent years, Japan's war industry has profited the most, followed by the chemical industry. Last year, more than 300 Japanese arms dealers averaged profits of more than 12%. However, 50% of the country's income is actually monopolized by the warlords. Japan is now forcibly subjecting strong young men in rural areas and elsewhere to military training for a certain period of time. The difficulty lies in the fact that after the training, there is no way to allow them to return to farming. This problem is very serious, and both the military and political circles are deeply worried. Turning to Fascism is actually the only way for Japan to handle state affairs today. There are many Chinese people in the Soviet Russian secret detective teams, especially in Vladivostok. There are 10,000 overseas Chinese in that area and the Lake Baikal region. From a transportation point of view, China is geographically isolated from Soviet Russia, as now going from China to Russia requires passing through the puppet state of Manchukuo forcibly occupied by the Japanese. The military and industrial programs stipulated in the Soviet Russian second five-year plan are proceeding very quickly. Soviet Russian industries are now secretly assisted by the army, especially in the area from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific coast. According to foreign military attachés, the Soviet Russian mechanized army is the most powerful in the world. All strong young men aged 22 must undergo military training for two to six years, from infantry drills to driving tanks and airplanes. A total of 1.5 million people are recruited for testing, and more than 300,000 have now been selected for enlistment. Soviet Russia is no longer as actively engaged in communist propaganda abroad as before. Soviet Russian officials believe that the strength of the military is already strong, so this kind of propaganda is no longer necessary. Therefore, they have now retreated to studying national defense. Soviet Russia is determined to defend the land along the Pacific coast, including the Vladivostok military port, because in the event of war, it can self-supply military needs and agricultural products without relying on Moscow. Last year, 2,000 tons of oil were produced in the northern corner of Sakhalin. Soviet Russia hopes that production can increase to 800,000 tons by 1937, so that it can protect the area with oil production. The Soviet Russian industrial program stipulates that Khabarovsk is the metropolis of the Far East, Chita is the metropolis of East Siberia, and Novosibirsk is the metropolis of South Siberia. Novosibirsk is the intersection of the Turkestan-Siberian Railway. Xinjiang's products are all exported through this route, so it is becoming increasingly important. Soviet Russian officials all believe that Xinjiang's fur trade and other products will inevitably use Novosibirsk as a distribution center in the future, and Xinjiang will rely on this export economically. Direct transportation between China and Xinjiang is difficult, so China is afraid that it will be difficult to maintain the province. The railway between Chita and the North Amur River is currently being laid and its track is being changed. A new railway is currently being built from Irkutsk to Lake Baikal to consolidate the region's economic development and to quickly transport troops in times of war. However, Soviet Russian farmers lack the mechanical knowledge necessary to manage industrial development. This is a major problem for Soviet Russia's transition from an agricultural country to an industrial country. The theoretically advocated wage equality is actually difficult to implement, because experienced workers naturally need to be paid higher wages than ordinary workers. Soviet Russian industrialized factories are now managed jointly by a national committee member, a party member, and a trade union leader. The housing problem in Soviet Russian cities is also one of the most difficult to solve. Although the government has built residential houses, it still cannot solve the problem of crowding in the city. The Japanese government, in view of Soviet Russia's ambitious operations, is now economically united with the puppet state of Manchukuo, building trunk roads to cut off the transportation between Vladivostok and Soviet Russia, and to make Vladivostok rely on Japan rather than Siberia. Japan is currently carrying out a "heavy industry program" in the puppet state of Manchukuo, believing that if it is short of pig iron supply, it will lose its important power as an industrial country. In recent years, Japan has been the largest market in the world for buying scrap iron. It is now planning to open iron mines in the puppet state of Manchukuo so that it will no longer rely on the world.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Facilitates the Flow of Silver Between the Interior and Coastal Areas</h3>
<p>Yesterday Instructed the Silver and Money Trades Associations</p>
<p>To Temporarily Suspend the Implementation of the Fourth Measure for Obtaining Licenses</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed the Shanghai Banking and Money Trades Associations yesterday, saying, "The requirement to apply for passports for transporting cash is originally intended to prevent the smuggling of goods for export. The Ministry had previously stipulated that the old licensing measures were limited to banks applying, and ordinary merchants were not allowed to use them. In addition, the passports were only issued by the Ministry, which was very inconvenient in remote areas. In consideration of the business situation, some flexibility was given, and five licensing measures were prescribed to facilitate matters. These measures have already been communicated separately. Now, according to previous reports, in this period of major settlement, the inland transport and trade is frequent and should be facilitated to avoid delaying opportunities. It is now provisionally approved that, except for the coastal and border areas where cash transport requires licensing in accordance with the original five measures, all inland cash transport shall temporarily suspend the implementation of the original fourth measure, in order to show the utmost consideration for the business situation. In addition to separate consultations, it is hereby ordered that the association shall transmit the order to all its member firms for compliance. This is the order."</p>
<h3>Silver to be Shipped to Shanghai will be Deposited in Three Banks for Financial Regulation</h3>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Rate Fell to 28 Cents and has Returned to Normal</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee has entrusted the Central Bank to purchase 20 million yuan of silver from Hong Kong. After the procedures are completed, it will be shipped to Shanghai in two batches. The first batch of 10 million yuan will be loaded onto a special ship in Hong Kong and shipped to Shanghai immediately, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai next week. For the sake of prudence, the special ship will not carry passengers except for the silver. At the same time, police will be sent to protect the ship. The date of loading the second batch is expected to be within the next week, and it is expected to arrive completely before the settlement of accounts for various industries.</p>
<h3>To be Deposited in Three Banks</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency who inquired with banking circles, after the silver arrives in Shanghai, it will be deposited in the Central, China, and Communications Banks for financial regulation. The funds designated by the above three banks are related to the mortgage loans for the silver and money trades, because it is deeply feared that if the Shanghai market experiences a cash crunch during the year-end settlement, this silver will be used as a mortgage loan for the silver and money trades as a precautionary measure. The purpose is to stabilize the market.</p>
<h3>Credit Conditions Gradually Easing</h3>
<p>Since the funds designated by the Central, China, and Communications Banks for mortgage loans for the silver and money trades, and the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee's purchase of silver and its shipment to Shanghai for regulation, credit conditions in Shanghai have gradually eased. The "yang chai" used in the money market has fallen from a peak of 60 cents to 35 cents. The opening market prices yesterday morning and afternoon fell to 28 cents, and have returned to normal.</p>
<h3>Articles of Association and List of Members of the Monetary System Committee</h3>

<h3>List of Committee Members</h3>

<h3>Setting up an Office</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance added a Shanghai office because most of the committee members were in Shanghai on official business. The office was intended to serve two purposes: to facilitate communication and to allow members to fully utilize the library of the Central Bank for consultation of global economic books and newspapers. The study of global monetary systems and silver and gold issues would also provide the committee ample resources for discussion during meetings. The meeting decisions would then be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval per the committee's charter's Article 7.</p>
<h3>Meeting Period</h3>
<p>The committee has decided to hold two meetings annually which will be convened in Nanjing. The exact dates for future meetings have not been set. The committee believes that the international economic tides are ever-changing, and in order to regulate the nation's monetary system, the domestic policies must adapt to that current. Failure to do so is to focus on the trivial and not address critical needs. For this reason, the committee is currently researching strategies to address the silver and gold questions. As soon as there is progress, proposed plans will be drafted and explored.</p>
<h3>Deputy Director of Postal Remittances Talks About Remittances to the Northeast</h3>
<p>To be Implemented on February 1st</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the September 18th Incident, postal routes between the interior and exterior of the customs have been severed. The government, under the principle of not recognizing the puppet Manchukuo but seeking convenience for the people between the interior and exterior of the customs, has established a remittance transfer bureau in the name of private individuals to handle the transfer of mail and remittance matters. The transfer of mail began yesterday. From yesterday, post offices across China received mail destined for the Northeast. As for remittances, the procedures are more complicated and will not be implemented until February 1st. The following is a speech by Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau: Previous Situation Mr. Xu first talked about the fact that before the September 18th Incident, the bureau operated both savings and remittances in the Northeast, and the business was quite good. The remittance business alone had an annual surplus of more than 300,000 yuan, and the total amount of savings was also considerable. This time, only the remittance business is being restored, and the business will inevitably be less than before.</p>
<p>Current Situation Since the September 18th Incident, all savings and remittance businesses in the four northeastern provinces have been suspended. However, due to practical needs, the people have still entrusted banks to handle remittances, which has become commonplace. Therefore, this time the bureau has restored</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department Notifies Absolute Use of Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>Instructions from the Central Executive Committee to all Comrades</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department notified the staff of the department yesterday, "For notification matters, the Central Executive Committee's instruction Yang Zi No. 760 stated, 'It has been found that the yarn industry in our country has been declining in recent years, factories and shops have been withered, and foreign goods are overflowing in the market, so that the outflow is increasing day by day, and the import surplus is increasing sharply. Thinking of this, it is heartbreaking. On the one hand, it is due to the dumping of foreign merchants and poor management. On the other hand, the lack of patriotism among the Chinese people and the psychology of enjoying buying foreign goods are also the reasons for the severe situation. The fourth session of the fifth plenary meeting of the committee discussed the case of promoting sales to rescue the national yarn industry, and several methods were discussed. In addition to those that should be handled by the government, the fifth item stipulates that "all public officials, party workers, teachers and students of various schools must use domestic goods uniformly, and it is absolutely forbidden to use non-domestic clothing." In addition to separate distribution, it is hereby ordered to inform and instruct the subordinate party departments to comply with the requirements. This is the order, etc.' Upon receiving this order, in addition to separate distribution, it is hereby notified to all working comrades in the department to comply with the requirements and not to violate them. The above is to notify the working comrades of our party department," etc.</p>
<p>Remittances, except for the provinces in North China, there is not much difference in the remittance business in other places.</p>
<p>Scheduled Restoration The bureau has not yet formally instructed its subordinates to handle remittances to the Northeast, because this matter is more complicated in procedure, or it will entrust banks to handle it, so it will not be implemented until February 1st. In the future, after implementation, all remittance procedures will still be the same as in the past, but the bureau will have one more allocation procedure.</p>
<h3>The Wusongkou Yesterday Morning Fog Traffic Smooth Entry Aground</h3>
<p>Yesterday Afternoon Towing Failed</p>
<p>Today Continue to Rescue</p>

<h3>The Maritime Administration Bureau Began Mediating the Shanghai-Ningbo Line Competition Yesterday</h3>
<p>First Called the Heads of Various Allied Companies to Talk</p>
<p>Hope to Maintain the Spirit of the Past to Find a Solution</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the ships sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the state-owned China Merchants Bureau's Xinjiangtian, the private Sanbei Shipping Company's Ningxing, the Ning-Shao Shipping Company's Xinning-Shao, and the British Taikoo Company's Beijing, have signed an alliance cooperation agreement to implement a water tariff sharing system. Now, the Sanbei Company has built its own wharf in Zhenhai and purchased the Lianhe Wheel from Jardine Matheson, renamed it Mingxing, and scheduled a trial run for tomorrow and sailing on the 14th, combining Wan Ningbo. Various allied companies have expressed their opposition. The China Merchants Bureau and the Ning-Shao Company have submitted a request to the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications for verification.</p>
<p>The Maritime Administration Bureau Suspends Handling and Mediates After receiving the request from the China Merchants Bureau and the Ning-Shao Company, the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau ordered the Sanbei Shipping Company to submit a report on the allied cooperation between the Mingxing Wheel sailing on the Shanghai-Zhen line and the Shanghai-Ningbo line for verification. Yesterday, it separately called the responsible persons of the Sanbei China Merchants Ning-Shao three companies to talk in order to carry out mediation. However, the bureau hopes that the allied companies will maintain the spirit of past cooperation and find a solution. As for the allied companies, they hope that the Maritime Administration Bureau will uphold justice.</p>
<p>The Convention May Be Dissolved The Sanbei Company's Zhenhai self-built wharf has been completed, at a considerable cost. In addition, the Mingxing Wheel's sailing route is best suited for the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Shanghai-Ningbo. Now the Yangtze River shipping industry is very depressed, so it must sail on the Shanghai-Zhen line. If it is ordered to abandon sailing, it will never be allowed. However, other companies strongly oppose it, so the alliance cooperation agreement may be dissolved, or another agreement may be established. Although Sanbei accounts for two wheels, the number of shares allocated is slightly reduced.</p>
<h3>National Coal Production and Sales Association Transports Lincheng Coal to Guangdong for Trial Use</h3>
<p>The National Coal Production and Sales Association has been established for six years and has worked hard to promote domestic coal and link the production and sales parties.

More than 1,100 tons were successfully loaded onto a smooth wheel from Tanggu, Tianjin, and transported to eastern Guangdong for trial use. According to the Guangzhou sales party, after receiving this coal, they all said that it was qualified and welcomed the telegram to continue loading and transporting, and actively carried out. Guangdong's coal consumption is very large, and the mine has a great prospect for development.</p>

<h3>Middle Cabin Workers Humiliated and Committed Suicide, All Employees of the Shipping Lines Jointly Request Negotiation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a petition was made to the Seamen's Union for assistance.</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, Tong Tianhou, a middle cabin worker on the Xianghe, which is operated by the British company Jardine Matheson on the Yangtze River route, failed to board the ship because it started early. Therefore, he transferred to the Longhe to catch up and planned to board the ship in Nanjing. However, the comprador of the Longhe, a Westerner named Newman, forced him to buy a ticket because he was boarding the ship without a ticket. The worker pleaded to buy a half-price ticket (from Shanghai to Beijing) because he had no money. However, after the ship arrived in Beijing, he still failed to catch up with the Xianghe. When he returned to Shanghai on the original ship, the comprador forced him to buy a ticket again and beat and humiliated him. Overwhelmed with resentment, the worker committed suicide by jumping into the river when the ship arrived in Wuhu. The body was examined by the Wuhu Local Court, which proved that he had suffered serious injuries and committed suicide by jumping into the river. Now, the middle cabin workers of various shipping companies under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Middle Cabin Office, including China Merchants, Nissin, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Datong, and Dada, were outraged when they heard about the incident. They believed that the Westerner deliberately abused Chinese workers. They had gathered several times to decide to organize a support association to conduct negotiations. Yesterday, Wang Oumin, a member of the Middle Cabin Office, was sent to the Chinese Seamen's Union to petition for assistance. Secretary Sun Luping received him and promised to collect evidence immediately and conduct negotiations. The workers believed that the matter was of international concern and would invite the press to report the incident within a few days and ask them to uphold justice in order to seek redress.</p>

<h3>Chenxing Telephone Completed</h3>
<p>Negotiating with Shanghai Telephone Bureau to install public telephones.</p>
<p>Chenxing District, Shanghai County, Pudong, is the central river town of Dou Ru Chahua in Nanhui.

<h3>Daxing Company's New Hongxing Ship to Make Maiden Voyage to Ningbo</h3>
<p>Costing More Than 300,000 Yuan, with New Equipment</p>
<p>And Planning to Invite People from All Walks of Life to Visit</p>
<p>This port's Daxing Shipping Company's original Hongxing ship, which runs the Shanghai-Ningbo route, is relatively small and has insufficient cabin space. Therefore, in October of the year before last, it set up the Hongchang Shipyard to add a new ship, named New Hongxing. The reporter of China News Agency learned that the ship was launched at the end of last month and is docked at the Daxing Pier on South City Outer Bund. It has been testing its engine on the Huangpu River for days and testing its speed. The ship is 22 feet long, 35 feet wide, and has a deep draft. It can travel about 13 nautical miles per hour. The ship's body is the same as the Ningbo style, but larger than the original Hongxing. It has three decks, more than 50 official cabins, first, second, and third class berths, and all the cabins. The total cost is more than 300,000 yuan, and the equipment is new. It is now actively arranging everything. It is said that the ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Ningbo this Friday or Saturday, and it is also planned to invite people from all walks of life to visit. During the maiden voyage, all passengers on the ship will receive gifts.

Therefore, before he could disembark, he was arrested by the Shanghai authorities on the order of California and detained in the West Prison on Xiamen Road. The woman went to Hong Kong on the original ship. Yesterday (9th), the U.S. Commissioner of China, Hillmelk, ordered Jin to be sent back to the Southern District Court of California for trial.

<h3>Rice Boats Docking at Foreign Wharf to Temporarily Maintain the Status Quo Within the Past Few Years</h3>
<p>Considering the Livelihood of the Workers</p>
<p>Discussing Methods Afterwards</p>
<p>More than 200 shoulder-carrying laborers from the foreign banks on the Wusong River petitioned the United Association of Rice Merchants in Northern Shanghai because the rice merchants of various gangs decided that all the rice and grain on the bank should be stopped from docking at the foreign bank wharf due to the danger of arranging ships. They requested that the current situation be maintained, considering the livelihood of the workers, but it was not approved. The shoulder-carrying laborers went to petition again yesterday, requesting that they temporarily continue to dock at the foreign bank wharf within the past few years, and then discuss concrete methods. The rice merchants, considering the livelihood of the workers, have agreed to temporarily arrange ships as before during the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Gruel Kitchen Continues to Open</h3>
<p>Another New Site Added, Accommodating 6,000 People</p>
<p>Since the second gruel kitchen on Liuying Road, which is sponsored by the Zhabei Charity Group, opened on the 1st of this month, the number of poor people going to the kitchen for food has been increasing day by day, with about 15,000 people per day. Therefore, the kitchen was insufficient in capacity and was temporarily closed on the 15th of this month. Wang Binyan, the director of the group, urgently sought follow-up methods and immediately convened a board meeting to decide to not only raise donations from the directors, but also solicit donations from other charitable organizations and philanthropists in order to continue the gruel distribution. Since the closure of the kitchen, it has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. The reporter of China Eastern News Agency went to the kitchen yesterday to investigate. The kitchen covers an area of about 7 acres and is covered with reed sheds. There are four kitchens in the east, west, south, and north inside the gate, which can cook 48 pots of gruel. Each day requires 32 stones of rice. If it is still not enough, copper coins will be issued, 9 for large mouths and 6 for small mouths. From the 1st to the 4th of this month, a total of 450,000 coins were issued, but it was still increasing day by day, making it difficult to maintain. Therefore, it was temporarily announced that the distribution would be suspended from the 5th. Wang is now planning to restore the kitchen and hired workers to add a kitchen to the east side of the kitchen the day before yesterday, which can accommodate more than 6,000 poor people. Coal stoves will be added to cook more than 10 pots of gruel, which will be completed in a few days and will continue to be open to benefit the poor.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Elder Zhang Danting Passed Away</h3>
<p>Zhang Danting, a well-respected elder in Zhejiang, passed away in his hometown of Huangyan at the age of 74. Friends in Shanghai and fellow villagers in Zhejiang and Taiwan plan to hold a memorial service. Zhang's name is Liansheng, and his courtesy name is Danting. He was from Huangyan County, Zhejiang. He joined the Zhejiang Tibiao Right Camp as a child and was promoted to captain due to his merits. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he asked to lead a team north to resist Japan. After the war, he served as the Zhen of Huzhou, Jiaza, Pingyang, and other towns in Zhejiang, and served as the commander of the Dinghai Zhen in Zhejiang twice. He was awarded the title of Zhenwei General and concurrently served as the commander of the Zhejiang Northern Route. At that time, the bandits in Zhejiang disappeared, and the people of the land still praised him. The following year, he was ordered to establish a police academy in Ningbo and served as the director. Therefore, most of the police chiefs came from his school. During the Xinhai Revolution, he happened to be in Suzhou and served as the commander of the Suzhou-Zhejiang Shallow Water Warship. He was the first to contact the various armies to revolt, and commanded the Jiangsu Xuanfeng Brigade and eight shallow water warships to assist the Zhejiang army in recovering Nanjing. He returned to the sea in the fourth year of the Republic of China to handle charitable affairs, such as the Chinese and Foreign Charity Accounts Association and the Zhejiang and Taiwan Six County Flood Disaster Association, saving the victims of the disaster, which was a great contribution.</p>

<h3>Continued Trial of the Mrs. Yu Case Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Yu He Zhenya, a Cantonese woman residing in a Western-style house at No. 60, Xi'ai Xiansi Road, in the French Concession, was riding in a chartered car to the Catholic Church on Luban Road to attend Mass at 8 am on October 21 last year. When she arrived near the Gao San Branch School on Xi'ai Xiansi Road, she was suddenly kidnapped by bandits who demanded a huge ransom. The ransom was negotiated in Suzhou. On November 19, the French police arrested six men and women, including the kidnappers Wang Fukang, Lin De, Tao Shuigen, Zhang Huizhi, Zhou Juqin, and the suspect Li Chunxiao, in Suzhou and Shanghai. The hostage was rescued, and two guns were seized. At the same time, Zhang Chunsheng, a 47th-class detective, was shot and injured in the left knee by the bandits when he was resisting arrest. The two bandits, Tong Lin and Tao, seeing the danger, shot themselves and injured themselves. They were sent to the hospital by the police for treatment. Tao died of his injuries, and Lin recovered after 50 days of treatment. He was brought back by the police for further investigation. The investigation was concluded, and they were sent to the Special Second Court on the 8th of this month for prosecution in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Bandits. The Lin bandit was also prosecuted for attempted murder. After Judge Xiong Huiping held a trial and questioned them separately, the trial was adjourned to another date due to lack of time. Yesterday afternoon, a special court was held for the continued trial. The details have been recorded in the newspaper on the 9th of this month. At 3 pm yesterday, Judge Xiong, accompanied by Secretary Tao, specially opened the second criminal court to continue the trial. Lawyer Gu Shouxi appeared in court on behalf of the Police Department. Li Chunxiao, one of the defendants, hired lawyer Li Ming to defend him. The defendants were still questioned separately. The testimonies of the defendants were the same as those given on the 9th, so they will not be repeated here. Then, the witness, the second landlord of the ticket hiding agency at No. 368, Yulin Road, was called to the stand. According to the testimony, the house was rented by Lin De and Zhou Juqin, and the rent was paid by Lin De. The coachman of the affected car and the gate guard of Gao San Branch School were also called to the stand for questioning. According to the coachman, someone pressed the back of the car canopy at that time, and my body was lifted up by the car, my feet were off the ground, and several people came up, lifted Mrs. Yu into the car, and escaped. I could not remember the faces of the bandits at the scene. After the bandits were arrested, the police ordered me to pull the car to the scene of the incident, and when the bandits demonstrated the kidnapping, I saw these two people (referring to Wang Fukang and Lin De) and recognized their faces. The gate guard of Gao San Branch School said that the scene of the incident was about 10 meters away from my post. I only heard screams for help and could not recognize the faces. At this point, the court adjourned the trial to the 24th because the victim, Yu He Zhenya, had not arrived. The defendants were still sent back to prison separately. However, Li Chunxiao was allowed to be transferred to the detention center at the request of his defense lawyer, but visits were prohibited. It is also heard that Li runs a shop in Suzhou and has a wife and children in Suzhou. He met Wang Fukang outside the Panmen gate and sent him to the train station, and was arrested together at the station. The result of the trial will be revealed in the future, but from this, we can see that we must be careful when making friends.</p>
<h3>Apprentices Playing With Each Other Causes Trouble</h3>
<p>Pu Jingen, a 21-year-old apprentice from Wuxi at the Weichang Machine Factory at No. 234, Tongzhou Road, Hongkou, was playing with another apprentice, Cui Xiwu, in the factory at 11 am yesterday, dodging each other with sharp triangular files. Cui Xiwu accidentally stabbed Pu Jingen in the abdomen, and blood flowed like a fountain, and he fell to the ground in extreme pain. The factory owner immediately notified the fire brigade to send an ambulance to the scene, and the injured person was sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury is very serious, and there is a risk of death. After hearing the news, the police immediately sent detectives to investigate and arrested Cui Xiwu, the perpetrator, and detained him in the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Dalin Road</h3>
<p>At 12:10 noon yesterday, two robbers, one wearing a royal horse-covered overcoat and the other wearing a gray cotton robe, speaking in a local accent, suddenly came to the Yongdexiang Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 6, Sanpinli, Dalin Road, Nanshi. They took out their guns and frightened Zhang, and stole 1,040 yuan in cash and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the factory's accounting room reported the incident to the Ximen Sub-Bureau and requested that they be pursued.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Songjiang Bus and Truck Collide at Maojiawan Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>A total of five people were injured.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Songjiang Long-Distance Bus Company sent driver Chen Quangen to drive the No. 3 bus from Songjiang to Shanghai at 7:30 yesterday morning. At 8:20, the bus passed Maojiawan, east of the Zhuanqiao Station on the Shanghai-Minhang South Zha Road. Suddenly, Wu Bangping, a driver from the Ruifeng Freight Company in Lujiabang, driving truck No. 13271, which was loaded with six electric poles and two water-mud covers from the Huashang Electric Company, and eight or nine workers, came head-on. At that time, the fog was thick, and it was difficult to see people. Although the truck was not running at full speed, it was in the middle of the road, and it was difficult for Chen to avoid it, resulting in a violent collision between the two vehicles. With a bang, the cylinders and glass of both vehicles were shattered, and the machines were completely damaged. Chen Quangen injured his right hand, and passengers Li Weixian (from Songjiang) and He Yunfu (from Shanghai) injured their heads and faces. They were sent to the Southeast Hospital by the Shanghai-Minhang Company for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were not serious. After bandaging, they were discharged from the hospital. The rest went to see a doctor themselves. Three workers on the truck were also injured by the shock and were sent to the Shanghai Hospital by the Xiqu Fire Brigade.</p>
<h3>A Rickshaw Crushed an Old Man to Death</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around eight o'clock, an old man, approximately sixty years old, was walking across the intersection of Xin Jiang Road and Bailu Road in Zhabei when suddenly a motorcar with the license plate number 15868 of the concession and municipal license number 12647 came speeding along. The old man was unable to dodge it and was knocked down on the spot, his head crushed. He died instantly, his flesh and blood a gruesome mess, a truly tragic sight. The police took the driver of the offending car into custody at the police station. Simultaneously, they ordered the local guarantor, Tan Fengding, to report the incident to the local court, requesting an inquest. Prosecutor Wu Deying and others were appointed to conduct the inquest, it is said.</p>
<h3>Husband Beats Pregnant Wife to Death</h3>
<p>At No. 2 Wu Family Residence, at the southern end of Longhua Town in western Shanghai, Jia Gen, the second son of the late Wu Zhigang (also known as Shu Chun), a local resident who previously sold narcotics, severely beat his wife, Lu Linyun, the night before last, causing a miscarriage. She lingered until dawn before dying of exhaustion. These details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Wu Zhengding, the chief of the Caojing Police Station in charge of the area, believes that because rumors are rife that the woman was beaten to death and because Wu is in hiding and has not reported the death to the police station or registered the death, there is strong suspicion of foul play. Yesterday, he specifically dispatched Liu Songjian, a patrol officer from the Longhua branch station, to conduct a thorough investigation and summoned relevant individuals such as Cai Rongxiang (also known as Tu Dong) and Cao A Mao for questioning. However, the body has already been prepared for burial, and it is feared that the families from both sides will be summoned soon to exhume the body for an examination to serve as the basis for further investigation, it is said.</p>
<h3>Case of a Money Shop Manager Misappropriating Funds</h3>
<p>The Jiukang Money Shop, located at No. 110 Beihai Road, has a capital of 14,000 yuan and is managed by Gong Chongzhong from Zhejiang and Xu Zhenting from Jiangyin.</p>
<p>Tang Jianting from Nanjing is the accountant, and Wang Changsheng is the supervisor. Gong and others each held one or two shares. On the first of this month, Wang Changsheng went to the Jiukang Money Shop to audit the accounts and discovered that Gong and the other two had embezzled 17,205 yuan of public funds. He reported this to the Old Gate Police Station, which ordered detective Weng Hongxun to arrest Gong and the others and hand them over to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention, as previously reported in detail. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the criminal division chief of the First Special Court, opened a first criminal court to re-examine the case. The three defendants hired lawyer E Sen for their defense. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, presented the case, prosecuting them for embezzlement under Article 357 of the Criminal Law. Subsequently, Gao Danhua, the plaintiff's representative, stated that the private suit portion had been settled, so he requested that the attached civil suit be withdrawn. When questioned, the defendants all confessed that because their salaries were low and the cost of living was high, they had to temporarily take the money. They claimed this was a common practice in the money shop industry, a kind of partner's debt. The court, recognizing that the facts were clear, ordered the start of the debate. After mutual arguments between the police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, and lawyer E Sen, lawyer E Sen requested that the defendants be allowed to post bail and be released. Judge Qian reviewed the confessions and ordered that a date be set for sentencing. Gong and Xu each posted 1,500 yuan bail, and Tang posted 1,000 yuan bail to be released pending judgment.</p>

<h3>China Children's Year to Begin on April 4th This Year</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Has Made a Firm Decision</p>
<p>The Grandeur of the American Children's Year</p>
<p>The year 1935 (Republican Year 24) will be China Children's Year. However, because the National Children's Year Preparatory Committee is still being organized within the Ministry of Education, the opening ceremony could not be held on New Year's Day this year. This reporter visited Chen Zhengfan, an executive of the China Child Welfare Association, who stated, "The Ministry of Education has now decided that China Children's Year will begin on April 4th, Children's Day. The Children's Year Preparatory Committee is also actively progressing within the Ministry of Education. The US government held American Children's Year in 1918, with the opening ceremony held on April 6th of that year and concluding on April 5th, 1919. Our country's decision to start on April 4th is quite similar to the situation in the United States at the time and is very appropriate. When the United States held Children's Year, President Wilson was in office. In the Children's Year declaration issued by the United States government, there was a sentence that said, 'For the sake of justice and the nation, we should provide perfect and thorough protection to the patriotic children who currently make up one-third of the national population. To achieve this goal, we are holding Children's Year. We want to save the lives of 100,000 infants and young children nationwide and further develop minimum child welfare standards for health education and labor for all children in the United States.' The American Children's Year movement was led by the Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor and promoted by the women's department of the United States National Defense Association. A total of 11 million women participated in the activities, producing 17,000 committees, and there was enthusiastic and active response throughout the country. In addition to the women's sector, countless university professors, church pastors, social workers, and librarians provided assistance in various ways. As a result, first, the infant mortality rate was reduced; second, standards for child rearing in the family were established; third, child labor laws were formulated; fourth, opportunities for outdoor activities, recreation, and entertainment for children were increased; and fifth, the problem of abandonment of orphans and poor children was resolved. It can be said that satisfactory results have been achieved. Our country's Children's Year movement should take the American precedent as a model. The true purpose of holding Children's Year lies in sincerely seeking happiness for children. The success of this effort should be expressed in deeds and in numbers. If the government only issues a decree and holds a few celebration meetings to conclude the event, then where is the meaning of Children's Year? Wouldn't that be completely contrary to the original intention of the initiators? As we prepare to hold Children's Year, I wish to share this sentiment with compatriots across the country. In addition, the Children's Year Song and the Outline of Implementation Methods for Children's Year have been printed and widely distributed nationwide.

<h3>Private Postal Bureau Letter Carrier Detained for Delivering Mail</h3>
<p>Waiting for the Postal Bureau Owner to Appear in Court for Further Verification</p>
<p>Private postal bureaus in our country have a long history. Almost every city, town, remote area, and border region has one. Before the establishment of the state-run postal service, private postal bureaus were the only means of communication for merchants. In recent years, the postal service has developed rapidly. The delivery of letters, goods, and remittances has become swift and reliable. The people's faith in the postal service has also become increasingly firm. Last year, the Ministry of Transportation believed that in order to further develop the postal service, private postal bureaus should first be eliminated. Therefore, it issued a circular to the postal administration bureaus of all provinces and cities, instructing them to inform all local private postal bureaus that they must cease operations by the end of the 23rd year of the Republic of China and ordering local administrative offices to assist in suppressing them. Although private postal bureaus everywhere protested and sent representatives to Beijing last month to petition for the continued existence of private postal bureaus in order to maintain the livelihoods of those working in the industry, the transportation authorities believed that the case concerned the development of the national postal service and rejected the request. They further ordered all post offices to refuse the delivery of letters and packages from private postal bureaus starting from New Year's Day this year. However, the private postal bureaus in this city have so far defied the ministry's orders and continue to receive and send letters and operate as usual. The other day, Dong Xiangfa, the owner of the Baoshun Private Postal Bureau at No. 366 Jiujiang Road, still sent letters from various places to Shanghai via the</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Heavy Fog Enveloped This City Last Night and This Morning</h3>
<p>Shops Operated with Lights On, Vehicles Moved Slowly with Horns Blaring</p>
<p>The Sun Was Dim, Many People Gathered to Watch</p>
<p>Jianghai Ships Were Blocked, Shanghai-Beiping and Shanghai-Hankou Flights Were Delayed</p>
<p>An unprecedented heavy fog occurred in this city yesterday morning, dissipating only at 9:00 AM. When the fog was heavy, people could not be distinguished even at close range. Shops all operated with lights on, and vehicles, even with lights on and horns blaring, moved very slowly and had difficulty driving. As for the ships entering and leaving the port, they were even more affected. At that time, this city had almost completely entered a night scene. A Datong reporter has recorded the various situations obtained below.</p>
<p>A Scene of Night. After dawn yesterday morning, opening the window revealed a misty atmosphere. By 8:30 AM, the fog had become very dense, and people could not be distinguished even at close range. Shops all opened their lights for business, and cars and trams all turned on their lights, rang their bells, or honked their horns and drove slowly. At that time, this city had almost completely entered a night scene.</p>
<p>Dim Sun. The sun rose very early yesterday morning, but it was obscured by heavy fog, its color like solidified grease, its light dim. People gathered on the streets to watch, marveling at the unusual sight. At the same time, a suffocating odor emanated from the fog, which was particularly foul. This heavy fog began to dissipate at 9:05 AM, and the weather became extremely clear and pleasant.</p>
<p>Ships Were Blocked. After the fog cleared, Datong News Agency reporters specifically investigated with the Jianghai Customs and various shipping companies. The ships that were blocked outside the harbor by the fog and only entered the harbor after the fog dissipated included the China Merchants Haiyuan Wheel, Jardine Matheson Hesheng Wheel, Taikoo Qiongzhou Wheel (all from Hong Kong to Shanghai), Haining Wheel (from Saigon to Shanghai), Zhengji Tongli Wheel (from Niuzhuang to Shanghai), Sanbei Ningxing Wheel (from Ningbo to Shanghai), and the Java Mailboat Gas Tokko. Their entry times were all after 9:00 AM, some as late as 1:00 or 2:00 PM. These ships were all supposed to arrive at the port at 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning. As for delayed departures, the Taikoo Huangpu Wheel, which was sailing to the various ports along the Yangtze River, also only left the port at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>Flights Were Delayed. The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou flight was also delayed from 7:00 AM to 9:50 AM, a delay of two hours and fifty minutes. The Shanghai-Beiping flight, which was originally scheduled to take off at 6:30 AM, was also delayed until 9:20 AM, a delay of three hours.</p>
<p>bureau to Shanghai, and hired letter carrier Zhang Shouhe from Ningbo to deliver them. When Zhang passed through Ji'an Lane on Henan Road, he was discovered by Lu Youtong, an inspector of the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau, who believed that Zhang should not be performing a prohibited service. He had him arrested and taken to the police station. The police chief sent a detective to confiscate 108 ordinary letters and 10 letters with checks attached from his letter bag and then ordered Zhang to leave. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the confiscated letters to the First Special District Local Court for disposition. First, the police station lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, explained what had happened. Then Lu Youtong and postal inspectors Ju Yunpeng and Jiang Junwen reported the circumstances of Zhang Shouhe's illegal delivery of letters. Judge Zhan Liangce ruled that because Dong Xiangfa, the owner of the private postal bureau, had not appeared in court, there was no way to proceed. He approved the temporary detention of the letters and ordered that the person in charge of Shishun Private Postal Bureau be summoned to court for further verification.</p>
<h3>Ke Yinghao Claims to Be Japanese and Assaults Lawyer in Court</h3>
<p>The Court Must Investigate with the Ministry of Interior</p>
<p>Ke Yinghao, a person from Shang'an Township in Fujian, previously leased No. 5 Ping Le Lane on Xizang Road from Liu Yide's leasing agency. He now owes rent for more than eight months, totaling over 1,600 yuan. The leasing agency hired lawyer Zhu Sifu to file a lawsuit for rent arrears and eviction with the First Special District Local Court. However, when the court bailiff served the summons, Ke suddenly claimed to be Japanese, causing the plaintiff's lawyer, Zhu Sifu, to request the court to order Ke to produce his citizenship certificate as proof at the last hearing. The case was adjourned. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo Chongtai continued the trial in Civil Court 7. Ke Yinghao also appeared in court. The court questioned Ke about his nationality. According to Ke, he is from Shang'an Township in Fujian. In June of the 9th year of the Republic of China (1920), when Qian Nengxun was the prime minister, he became a Japanese citizen. Ji, the Chinese consul in Kobe, Japan, applied to the Chinese Ministry of Interior for his renunciation of Chinese citizenship a year earlier. There is a record of this. He also presented a Japanese citizenship certificate as evidence. Lawyer Zhu Sifu immediately stated that according to Article 11 of the Nationality Law, citizenship cannot be lost without a renunciation certificate from the Ministry of Interior. He requested that the court investigate. At this time, Ke stepped down from the defendant's box and strode around the judge's seat with an arrogant attitude. The court informed him that no matter what nationality people were, they should obey the rules of the court and not act arbitrarily. A court attendant stepped forward to stop him, but Ke refused to obey and went to the lawyer's table and punched lawyer Zhu Sifu, saying, "You said I was impersonating a Japanese citizen. I have to hit you." At the time, his voice was loud and aggressive. The court attendant immediately stepped forward to stop him, and Judge Luo also sternly stopped him. Ke still acted forcefully and said to lawyer Zhu, "When you go outside, I will punch you." At this time, the court ordered the case to be adjourned for further investigation with the Ministry of Interior and adjourned the court. Ke waited for a long time at the court entrance before leaving. Lawyer Zhu waited in the lawyer's lounge for Ke to leave before returning by car, thus avoiding him.</p>
<h3>Englishman Wei Bai Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>British Consulate Investigating the Cause</p>
<p>Wei Bai, an Englishman, worked in the accounts department of the British American Tobacco Company and resided on the 12th floor of a 13-story building on the corner of Ma'erxi Road on the French Concession. He habitually left in the morning and returned in the evening. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, Wei suddenly told the building's servant that he was feeling unwell and needed to take a nap for an hour, instructing him not to disturb him. After speaking, he tightly closed his door. After about half an hour, a gunshot suddenly rang out from Wei's room. The servant knew something was wrong. When he rushed in to inspect, he saw Wei lying in a pool of blood. Fresh blood was flowing from a bullet hole in his right temple. A lotus-shaped pistol was discarded on the floor. It was clear that he had committed suicide. The building's accounts department reported the incident to the French police station, and the police chief immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. At the same time, the British police station was notified and sent officers to the scene. The British Consulate also heard the news and sent people to the scene to conduct an on-site inspection. The cause of his suicide is currently being investigated in detail by the British Consulate.</p>
<h3>Family Scandal: Mailman and Amateur Actor</h3>
<p>Judge Prohibits Audience</p>
<p>Mailman Fined 50 Yuan</p>
<p>Li Yun, a Ningbo native working as a clerk for the British firm Old Jinlong Foreign Firm, is only nineteen years old, has a graceful demeanor, and comes from a wealthy family. In his spare time, he studies drama for his own enjoyment and has joined the Dacheng Drama Club on Qipu Road as an amateur actor. In the same club is Zhou Peijun from Kunshan, currently a mailman for post office number 548, whose home is at number 108 Hexing Lane, Wuzhou Road, Hongkou. Li and Zhou, having the same interests, became increasingly close, and Zhou was particularly attentive to Li because he was the son of a wealthy family. He often invited Li to his home for pleasant conversations. When Li arrived at Zhou's house, Zhou would order his</p>
<h3>Wife Fang Juanlin</h3>
<p>to come out and socialize, their relationship resembling that of close family friends. Fang, a native of Beiping, is only twenty-two years old, quite beautiful, and currently works as a nurse in a hospital. Her social skills are also superior. Li Yun, being constantly exposed to her beauty, could not help but become enamored. Over time, they both forgot themselves and gradually became involved in an affair, often using hotels as temporary places for rendezvous. This went on until July of last year, occurring five times in total. Zhou Peijun was not unaware of this, but he pretended to be deaf and blind, not interfering. His reason for being so accommodating was not that he was willing to wear the green hat, but rather that he</p>
<p>Had ulterior motives. Later, because Fang only did the first step of the work, while the second step of the plan was delayed, Zhou often reprimanded her. Feeling resentful, she quietly went to Hangzhou and attempted suicide, but was fortunately rescued and survived. Zhou then used this as an excuse to negotiate with Li, saying that his beloved wife had been defiled by him and that their love had been broken. Since he was fond of her, he should treat her well and pay him ten thousand dollars to compensate for his loss. After negotiations, Li wrote a four-hundred-yuan promissory note from his friend surnamed Zhu and gave it to Zhou as a hush money.</p>
<p>The matter subsided. The other day at dusk, the Zhu family held a celebratory banquet at the Eastern Hotel on Xizang Road, inviting many guests, including Li and Zhou. Fang Juanlin was also one of the female guests. After drinking, everyone was touched by old feelings, and the ashes of a dead fire were rekindled. However, both sides knew that publicizing this matter would damage their reputation, so they rented room number 357 in the hotel and went inside to negotiate. At that time, Li Yun's younger brother, Li Yugui, was also at the banquet. Seeing his brother being forced into the room by the Zhou couple, fearing he would be embarrassed, he immediately reported to the Old Gate Police Station by telephone. The police chief sent detective Feng Xiushan</p>
<p>To investigate. According to Li Yun, twenty yuan in cash, two gold rings, and a watch had been taken from him by Zhou and the others. The detective then searched and found the twenty yuan in cash in Zhou's pocket, and the gold rings and watch were found on Fang. He then brought Zhou Peijun and Fang Juanlin to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Chief Judge Qian Hongye conducted the trial. The police station lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the case, stating that the defendants' actions constituted a violation of Article 370 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Extortion by Intimidation. He requested that they be punished according to the law. Li Yun then testified that he lived at No. 10 Xingjiaqiao Road in Zhabei. The court, believing that this case was related to public morals, immediately announced that the audience was prohibited. After all irrelevant persons had left the court, the court questioned both sides one by one and then concluded the trial. Subsequently, Zhou Peijun was sentenced to a fine of fifty yuan, and Zhou Fang was found not guilty. After the judgment was delivered, Judge Qian also advised Zhou Peijun that if Li Yun did indeed have an adulterous relationship with his wife, he could collect evidence and file a lawsuit according to law and should not use this as an excuse for extortion. Now, considering that it was his first offense, he was leniently fined as a warning.</p>
<h3>The Altered Bankbook Case in the Seduction Case</h3>
<p>Changing One Yuan to Three Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The Adulterer Has Bad Intentions</p>
<p>The Nanshi Local Court recently accepted a case of seduction and flight, which also led to the alteration of a bankbook, the circumstances of which were quite interesting. Therefore, the details are recorded below. Shao Rongquan, a local man over thirty years old, opened a rosewood shop near the Little World inside the Xinbei Gate. He married Han Liwen as his wife. The couple was unusually loving, and Shao Rongquan, being of a loyal and honest nature, entrusted all finances to Han's care. Although she was of average appearance, she was naturally flirtatious, attracting bees and butterflies. Recently, she had an affair with a gigolo, Yang Yonghai. She often went out on the pretext of various excuses, meeting secretly in inns. Realizing that this could not continue for long, Shao Rongquan received more than three hundred yuan in savings and gave it all to Han for safekeeping. She took the money and deserted her husband, disappearing without a trace. Shao Rongquan, who had been diligent and thrifty, suddenly lost both his wife and his money. He was heartbroken that his wife had shamelessly abandoned him and that he had lost a large sum of money. He was so angry that he wanted to die, and he could neither eat nor sleep. Later, he learned that Han and Yang Yonghai had rented a house at No. 4 Ziyang Lane, Huminnan Zhe Road in Nanshi. The house was a single-family shikumen, rented by Yang, with a monthly rent of twenty-eight yuan, and they were living like husband and wife, living a new life. Shao reported the situation to the local court. After receiving the report, the court sent the police to cooperate with the plaintiff the next morning to arrest them at the address. At that time, the adulterer and adulteress were still fast asleep. They arrested the pair of lovebirds and brought them to the court for interrogation and detention. Shao Rongquan found a Shanghai Bank bankbook in Shao Han's name in the room. Upon closer inspection, the amount of savings was three hundred yuan. Shao was overjoyed, thinking that he had recovered his lost treasure. He took the bankbook to the Ximen Shanghai Bank to withdraw the savings. The teller discovered that the bankbook was a monthly one-yuan savings book (the book only had one yuan saved). The one yuan had been altered to three hundred yuan. The teller immediately detained Shao and summoned the police, who brought him to the police station. Shao Rongquan confessed the previous events and said that the altered bankbook must have been created by the adulterer to mislead him. Upon deliberation, the prosecutor ordered that Yang Yongmei and Shao Han be detained separately, and Shao Rongquan was released on bail pending further instructions. According to Shao, the</p>
<h3>Interrogation of the Case of Robbery of Twelve Small Dollars, in Which a Thief Was Killed and a Police Officer Wounded</h3>
<p>The Cause Arose from a Lack of New Clothes for the Wedding</p>
<p>Xu Guochang Detailed the Pretext of Buying Coal</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM the other day, two bandits suddenly came to the Zhonghua Coal Ball Company branch at No. 3 Shan Zhong Road, Hege Road in the French Concession. They brandished a pistol, threatening silence. They stole twelve small dollars from the drawer at the accounting desk. When they carried the stolen goods out, the victim followed and shouted for help. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest, mortally wounding a police officer No. 192. At the same time, one of the bandits was shot in the right leg by the police officer returning fire and was captured. He identified himself as Li Heshang, 27 years old, and was taken to the police station for investigation. The details were briefly recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a supplement to the detailed record of the</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Incident</h3>
<p>At the time, two bandits suddenly came to the Zhonghua Coal Ball branch. One bandit wearing a long robe went inside to rob, while the one wearing a short coat and holding a pistol stood at the door. After obtaining the loot, they fled out the door, heading north on Hege Road. The bandit with the gun escaped on a bicycle. The victim, Xu Guochang, (an employee of the Zhonghua Coal Ball branch) followed behind, identifying the one riding the bicycle. He chased him to Hege Road and reported it to Officer No. 581, who was standing in front of No. 277 and No. 279. The officer immediately caught up and pursued him. He chased him to the intersection of Fucaisen Road and Yaojiaozhu Road, where Officer No. 434, who was stationed there, joined the chase. At the intersection of Baisai Zhong Road, Officer No. 192, who was also stationed there, saw two Chinese and Vietnamese officers chasing the bandit on a bicycle. Officer No. 192 immediately went to meet him and block him. The bandit immediately pulled out his gun and opened fire to resist arrest.</p>
<h3>The Bullet Hit</h3>
<p>Officer No. 192 in the chest, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. At that time, Officer No. 434, who was chasing from behind, saw the bandit open fire to resist arrest and immediately pulled out his gun. Yang Yonghai enticed and seduced her. Han often went out on the pretext of various excuses, having secret rendezvous in inns. Realizing that this could not continue for long, Shao Rongquan received more than three hundred yuan in savings and gave it all to Han for safekeeping. She took the money and deserted her husband, disappearing without a trace. Shao Rongquan, who had been diligent and thrifty, suddenly lost both his wife and his money.

<h3>A Brief History of Ruan Lingyu</h3>
<p>Zhang Damin: Past Events Like a Dream, Unbearable to Look Back On</p>
<p>Tang Jishan: A Book of Misunderstandings Leads to Litigation in Court</p>
<p>Ruan Lingyu, a female star who currently holds an important role at the Lianhua Film Company, is a name known to almost everyone, even women and children. She once starred in a certain play, and those familiar with her life story all said that the film was Ms. Ruan's personal account. Ruan was originally from Lingnan. Her father passed away early, and her mother worked as a servant. Ruan was fond of learning. Despite the poverty of her family and the struggle to secure food, she still managed to attend school. In 1927, while studying at Chongde Girls' School, she met Zhang Damin, a native of Zhongshan County. Zhang was from a wealthy family and was only twenty-four or twenty-five years old at the time and not yet married, while Ruan was only nineteen. Due to the disparity in their wealth, they could not immediately become a couple. Later, when Ruan's mother was dismissed by her employer, Zhang, feeling that the mother and daughter were in increasingly dire straits, provided financial assistance. Ruan then vowed to devote herself to him for life. Just as the agreement was made, Zhang's mother passed away, making it difficult to hold the wedding immediately. Ruan, fearing that things would change over time, took the opportunity to move into Zhang's house and observe mourning together. From then on, they were practically husband and wife. Later, Zhang went to Hong Kong, serving as a comprador for the Ruian Steamboat and as the director of the Fuqing County Tax Office in Fujian Province, among other positions. He always left Ruan in Shanghai. However, when Zhang was working in Fujian Province, Tang Jishan, a fellow townsman of Zhang's who is now the manager of the Huacha Company, often visited Zhang's house. Over time, he became acquainted with Ruan. They often went to dance halls and theaters together, which eventually led to a romantic relationship. Ruan had never formally married Zhang, and her status was not proper. After becoming involved with Tang, she took the opportunity to take her clothes and belongings, along with her daughter Zhang Miaorong, and left Zhang's house to officially follow Tang. Recently, Zhang Damin has taken a job at the Yida Industrial Company on Sichuan Road in Shanghai. Suddenly, the old matter was brought up again, and he consulted with lawyer Sun Biwu, intending to take legal action against Ruan and Tang. On the 27th of last month, lawyer Sun, acting on behalf of Zhang Damin, sent a letter to Tang Jishan, accusing him of stealing property and misappropriating clothing worth over three thousand yuan, and of privately forging Zhang's seal. After receiving the letter, Tang believed that all the accusations were untrue and immediately hired lawyer Xiong Fei to sue Zhang Damin in the First Special District District Court for fabricating facts and defaming his reputation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Yingchao opened the court to hear the case. After the plaintiff presented his case, the defendant Zhang Damin also detailed his seven or eight years of cohabitation with Ruan Lingyu, and how Tang Jishan took advantage of his absence to visit his home, leading to an affair with Ruan. Ruan then took her clothes and belongings, left his family, and remarried Tang Jishan. He also stated that after returning to Shanghai, he had discussed the matter with lawyer Sun Biwu, intending to entrust lawyer Sun to file a lawsuit, but he had not instructed Sun to send a letter to Tang. Subsequently, lawyer Hong Shihao defended the defendant, arguing that the elements of the crime of defamation, according to Article 325 of the Criminal Law, require an intention to disseminate to the public and to point out or relate facts sufficient to damage another person's reputation. In this case, only one letter from lawyer Sun exists. It is questionable whether this constitutes the crime. Moreover, the letter is not even the defendant's assertion. The court should investigate this carefully. After both sides finished their arguments, the court announced that it would announce the verdict next Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>...fired back, the bullet hit the bandit's right leg. The bandit still carrying a bicycle and turned into Lane 261 of Baisezhong Road. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared. The long-robed thief had already fled without a trace. The patrol immediately reported to the police station and sent the body of the Vietnamese policeman No. 192 to the autopsy room of Talas Tuo Road Small Hospital for examination. Soon, the French police station received a call from a Westerner residing at No. 247, Lane 261, Baisezhong Road</p>
<h3>Telephone Report</h3>
<p>Stating that his servant, Li Heshang (27 years old, from Pudong), was injured by stray bullets on the way and sent to the hospital for treatment. The head of the detective immediately dispatched Zhou Buguang, a special agent detective, to investigate. At first, Li flatly denied it, insisting that he was injured by stray bullets. However, after repeated questioning by the Bao Detective, and identified by Wang Kaiwu, a rickshaw puller who witnessed the scene, Chen Ronggen, a scrap collector, and the victim Xu Guochang, that the person who resisted arrest and fired a gun was Li. At this point, Li realized that he</p>
<h3>Could Not Deny It</h3>
<p>Admitted to going with Jin Kui, who was on the run, to rob. The pistol was placed in the master's house. The detectives went to his employer's Western house and took out a Browning pistol, four bullets, and a short coat with a bullet hole that Li had changed, and a pair of shoes. They also detained the suspect, Li Yushi, a woman who served in the same family (25 years old, from Suzhou, Li's mistress, who worked as an amah there), and Zhang Linwen (28 years old, from Jiangyin, shop assistant), a man and a woman, and took them to the police station. At the same time, Li Fei was sent to the hospital. After the doctor applied medicine and bandaged him, he was still taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, the French police station reported to the French Consulate to send someone to the autopsy room to verify the body of the dead Vietnamese policeman. Then, the defendants were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, and Zhang Chaozuo</p>
<h3>Judge Interrogation</h3>
<p>The police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang explained the case and requested a postponement of two weeks to investigate whether the defendant had committed other crimes before filing a lawsuit. Subsequently, detective Zhou Buguang reported the investigation and arrest of the defendant, presented the coat and shoes to the court, and stated that the pistol and bullets had to be carefully inspected by the police station and could not be presented to the court. According to the victim Xu Guochang, the thief in the long robe came to call at 4 pm yesterday to open half a ton of Pingmei coal and instructed to send it to the Westerners' house at No. 44 Daixi Road. Asked me the price. I replied that it was 15 yuan per ton, and asked him which customers he had not done business with before, whether the payment was cash or credit. He said it would be paid at the beginning of the month. After he finished speaking, he left for about five minutes, and then came back and said he wanted half a ton of coal, opening a price of nine yuan. I replied that it was not possible. He also claimed to ask the Western servant, and then turned back and went to the store for the third time after about ten minutes, standing next to the account desk, forcing me to issue an invoice for nine yuan. I still replied that it was not possible. He then took a rope and tied me up. The thief Li stood at the door, holding a pistol and told me not to move. The thief who tied me up opened the iron box. Because there was no money in the box, he opened the drawer of the counter,</p>
<h3>Robbed a Little Silver</h3>
<p>Ten or more corners and fled. I immediately untied the rope and chased out, reporting to the patrol to pursue and arrest, etc. When asked the defendant Li Heshang, he confessed that he was a thief and that Jin Kui was out to rob. Because Jin Kui was getting married in the first month of the year, he was short of a piece of clothing, had no money to make it, and lacked fifty yuan. He asked me to help him rob. I don't know how much money he robbed. I heard that there were only twelve corners of foreign money. The pistol was held by me. This gun belongs to my friend Xi Jinrong. He got it from Zhabei before and has always kept it with me. There are six bullets. Because I know that there is money in the China Coal Briquette Company and there are not many people, only two people,</p>
<h3>So Dare to Rob</h3>
<p>After the robbery, I fled on a bicycle. Because I saw the patrol blocking the way, I fired a shot. Unexpectedly, two shots were fired, killing someone. I don't know. When confessing to resisting arrest, he demonstrated the state of holding the gun with his right hand and firing under his left arm. Li Yushi and Zhang Wenlin confessed that they did not know that Li Heshang was a thief or the robbery. The witnesses Wang Kaiwu and Chen Ronggen testified that they saw Li's thief firing a gun at the time. The court ordered a postponement to the 24th for another hearing, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

It has now been proven that Yang altered it to deceive. The believed it was a deposit passbook of three hundred yuan and kept it properly, but I have been harmed by it."</p>

In the past, the society's internal organization was divided into a general affairs department and an editorial department under the board of directors. Recently, with the development of the society's affairs, the original organization was no longer sufficient to cope with the situation. Therefore, the society's constitution was amended last year, and the organization was changed.

However, due to the current poor economic situation, the Municipal Council has not yet approved the request.</p>
<h3>Wang Xinmin, He Bingsong, and Others Publish a Declaration on Chinese-Centric Cultural Construction</h3>
<p>(Part Two)</p>
<p>Around 1915 and 1916, China was mired in revolutionary setbacks, internal crises, and foreign aggression. Many people believed that politics was not enough to save the country and that cultural means were needed. Thus, the May Fourth Cultural Movement, centered on liberating thought and breaking fetters, arose. Through this movement, the thinking of the Chinese people underwent a transformation.</p>
<p>The new awakening demanded new activities. The Chinese Revolutionary Party, which had led the Xinhai Revolution, was reorganized in response to the times, and political movements unfolded on a large scale. The cry to overthrow warlords and imperialism spread throughout the country, forming a great National Revolution. Despite various twists and turns, China's political transformation finally achieved considerable success after several years of effort.</p>
<p>The current problem at this time is national construction. Construction in the political and economic fields has already begun, and cultural construction should also be started, and it is even more urgent. However, how to construct Chinese culture is a question that urgently needs to be discussed. Some people think that China should return to the past, but ancient China has become history. History cannot be repeated, nor does it need to be repeated. Some people think that China should completely imitate the United Kingdom and the United States. The United Kingdom and the United States have their own characteristics, but China, which is not the United Kingdom or the United States, should have its own unique ideology. Moreover, China is now in a period of transition between an agricultural feudal society and an industrial society, which is different from the United Kingdom and the United States, which have completely entered the industrial era. Therefore, we cannot agree to completely imitate the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to those who advocate imitating the United Kingdom and the United States, there are two other factions, one advocating imitating Soviet Russia and the other advocating imitating Italy and Germany. However, their errors are exactly the same as those who advocate imitating the United Kingdom and the United States, which is to underestimate the particularity of China's space and time.</p>
<p>Currently, various different views are competing with each other, and China has become a battlefield for various different views. Moreover, the demonic hands of various international cultural aggressions, which penetrate various different views, are also secretly active, each wanting to win the final victory. Can we let them fight in chaos?</p>
<p>Three, what should we do? No, we cannot let it develop naturally. We demand a Chinese-centric cultural construction. In the process of construction, we should have the following understanding: One, China is China, not any region, and therefore has its own particularity. At the same time, China is the China of today, not the China of the past, and has its own certain temporality. Therefore, we pay special attention to the needs of this time and this place. The needs of this time and this place are the basis of the Chinese standard. Two, it is useless to simply praise ancient Chinese systems and ideas, and it is equally useless to simply curse ancient Chinese systems and ideas. It is necessary to examine everything in the past, keep what should be kept, and remove what should be removed. The commendable good systems and great ideas should be vigorously promoted and contributed to the world, while the condemnable bad systems and inferior ideas should be eliminated as much as possible, without any reluctance. Three, it is necessary and appropriate to absorb European and American culture, but we must absorb what should be absorbed, and we should not absorb even the dregs with an attitude of complete acceptance. The standard of absorption should be determined by the needs of modern China. Four, Chinese wooden cultural construction is creation, a creation that catches up with the head. The purpose of creation is to enable China and the Chinese people, who have declined in the cultural field due to the loss of characteristics, to not only be able to keep pace with other countries and people in the cultural field, but also to make the most valuable contribution to the world's culture. Five, we are building China in culture, not abandoning the ideal of universal harmony, but building China first, becoming a whole and healthy unit, and having sufficient power to promote world harmony. In short, China must have a self-awareness, but also a world vision, both the generosity of not closing itself off, and the determination not to blindly imitate. This understanding can be considered a profound understanding.</p>
<p>Moving forward along this understanding, our cultural construction should be: not conservative, not blindly following, based on the Chinese standard, adopting a critical attitude, and applying scientific methods to examine the past, grasp the present, and create the future. Not conservative means eliminating the old culture, removing its dregs, keeping its essence, and striving to open up new roads. Not blindly following means taking the good points and abandoning the bad, choosing the good and following it, and still not losing self-awareness in following the good. Based on the Chinese standard, adopt a critical attitude, and apply scientific methods to examine the past, grasp the present, and create the future, which is to settle the past mistakes, supply the current needs, and determine the future direction, and use cultural means to produce a bright and warm China, so that China can restore its past glory in the cultural field, reoccupy an important position, and become the strongest and most powerful force in promoting world harmony.

<h3>New Year's Day Hong Kong Holds Guangdong-Hong Kong Track and Field Competition</h3>
<p>Champion: Guangdong Guangnan Team 96 points</p>
<p>Runner-up: Hong Kong British Navy 37 points</p>
<p>Third Place: Hong Kong South China Team 34 points</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Guangdong track and field team competition had been in the works for a long time and had not yet been held. It was not until New Year's Day this year that it was finally realized in Hong Kong. First, the Guangdong Guangnan track and field team and the Hong Kong South China Athletic Association completed the negotiation of the arrangements. On the 31st of the previous month, dozens of members of the Guangnan team set off from Guangzhou. The leaders were Guo Songtang, Zhao Shanxing, and Qiu Jixiang; the coach was Zhang Weixin; the captains were Zhong Lianji and Zhao Hui; the Chinese secretary was Chen Futian; the Western secretary was Wang Minxian; and the staff were Zhao Bingheng, Cao Zhaohui, and He Yunsong. The team members included (sprint) Zhao Bingheng, Zhu Zhongxi, He Peigen, Fu Jiagui; (middle distance) Zhao Hui, Chen Futian, Han Yingguang, Lin Kai; (hurdles) Zhong Lianji, Li Jinquan, Chen Yaosheng; (jumps) Cao Zhaohui, Wang Minxian, Chen Yaochi, Ma Deguang, Zhang Qijun; (throws) Liang Zhichu, Guo Zemin, Huang Tianan, Jin Zizhang, Zhang Xuetong; women's team: Situ Wei (manager), members Zhao Yunshan, Li Yuanfen, Liang Qianhua, Zhang Jieqiong, Yan Xiurong, Kuang Yuzhen, Xue Dong, Li Yulan, He Jingxiong, Zhong Jinping. After arriving in Hong Kong, they were hosted by the Hong Kong South China Association, and the Hong Kong British Navy track and field team was also invited to participate, forming a triangular competition. On New Year's Day, despite the heavy rain, the competition was held at 2:00 pm at the South China Sports Field on Caroline Hill in Hong Kong. During the competition, the rain did not stop, and the slippery track greatly affected the results. As a result, the Guangdong Guangnan team won first place with 96 points, the Hong Kong British Navy team came in second with 37 points, and the Hong Kong South China team came in third with 34 points. After the competition, the Hong Kong South China Association held a welcome party and presented the championship prizes. The captain of the Guangdong Guangnan team then gave a reply and presented commemorative flags to the Hong Kong South China Association and the Hong Kong British Navy. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic. This time, the Guangnan women's team did not have an opponent in Hong Kong, so the competition was not held. It is learned that the Guangnan team returned to the province on the 3rd. The results of this Guangdong-Hong Kong inter-city track and field competition are listed below:</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Hearing Words, Covering Tearful Traces, Selling Oneself to Tell Hardships, Discreetly Seeking Eastern Reliance with Ardent Affection</p>
<p>Only then did Yueying force out a word, wiping away tears, and said, "Thank you, Mr. Cheng." As she spoke, she stood up. At this moment, Wang Beihai, who had been sitting in the corner, suddenly stood up and waved his hand, saying, "Hold on, I have something to say." Everyone was taken aback; what could he have to say at this time? He waited for Yueying to stop, but did not speak to Yueying. He turned to Aunt Hu and said, "I heard Mr. Cheng's words and feel very sorry for you. However, my strength is limited, and I cannot help you much. I brought six or seven catties of sorghum cakes from home, and I can share half of them with you." As he spoke, he untied the bundle on the table, revealing more than twenty large sorghum cakes inside. Cheng Zhishu smiled and waved his hand at him, saying, "Saving people is indeed a duty of mankind, but saving people in a well only results in falling into the well yourself. I don't approve of this. It's good that you have this intention, but there's no need to give it to them. Otherwise, where will you find half a week's worth of food?" As he spoke, he smiled at Li Shilian, saying, "Mr. Li won't understand this unless I explain it clearly. The students in Xi'an are very hardworking. Look at the set of clothes he's wearing; it's almost like this all year round. Students in Shanghai and Beiping probably sleep on iron beds as a matter of course, but they all sleep on earthen pits. Especially when it comes to food, you wouldn't believe it." As he spoke, he pointed to the dark sorghum cakes on the table and said, "This stuff is from the countryside, not from the city of Chang'an. If the student's home is no more than thirty or fifty miles from the city, they will walk home on Saturday afternoon and return to the city on Sunday afternoon. This trip is not for anything else but to go back and get this stuff. Sorghum cakes are worthless, but how these sorghum cakes are brought to Chang'an is worth studying. Because of this, I don't approve of Wang Jun giving sorghum cakes to Aunt Hu. Besides, he only has seven catties of sorghum cakes each week, which is barely enough to eat. If he gives half of it away, where will he get the other half?" (109)</p>
<h3>Sacred Drama</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>In the midst of rural bankruptcy, is it not a contradictory and strange thing to suddenly hear the words "sacred drama"? Last week, in the northwest of Jiading, in a place called "Laozhu Hui," a grand sacred drama was staged. It is said that the cost of this performance was raised by using the name of the Bodhisattva in the temple to solicit donations from house to house. Moreover, this time, the Jianghu opera troupe, named Tianji Grand Stage, had complete roles and decent costumes, so it attracted an especially large number of spectators from all over the villages. However, after four plays were performed, the surrounding fields, like beans and wheat, were undoubtedly trampled on a lot. But a group of villagers still said that performing the drama for a few days this year to honor the Bodhisattva would surely bring a year of abundance and a full harvest! What kind of talk is this!</p>
<p>Oh! Don't blame the countryside; it's not that the farmers have no knowledge and want to stage sacred dramas. Even now, people in the city are very happy to watch dramas. They have to borrow the authority of the Fire God Bodhisattva. As long as there is a leading qualification, they immediately take out the yellow book of names and say a few words of reverence to the gods, and money will naturally be taken out. And there are dramas to watch, so who wouldn't be willing? As a result, a small Fire God Temple became so noisy that the walls almost collapsed and people were crushed to death. Also, because the opera troupe's expenses were not enough, in addition to honoring the gods, they moved to the Yimiao Temple at night to sell tickets. Although the venue was slightly larger, it was still packed. Especially the viewing stands were arranged without any gaps, but there were too many spectators, and there were constant sounds of the stands collapsing. There were even people who had their feet crushed and injured. Can you imagine how pitiful that is!</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is that people who save money and don't sit in the stands stand in the square, called "Zha Tai Qian" (squeezing in front of the stage). These people are very strong. Although they sometimes resemble a tide, they can still struggle to stand on their feet. Those who are not strong will be squeezed down, and even lose their footing, and their shoes will fall off. They pick them up and throw them onto the stage, piling them up high. Therefore, when the play ends, people often leave barefoot, stepping on the ground with socks, indicating that they have come back from watching the play. Or they have to go to the shoe store and buy new ones to put on before leaving. Alas! Don't laugh at the farmers in the countryside; in fact, the people in the city watching plays at the theater are just like them. What's the grandfather laughing at the grandmother for!</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Tu Hongxia)</p>
<p>Jin Shengtan of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms said: "The eighteen lords could not kill Dong Zhuo, but Diao Chan was enough to kill him; Liu, Guan, and Zhang could not defeat Lu Bu, but Diao Chan, a woman, could defeat him; she used the bed as a battlefield, rouge and powder as armor, glances as spears, smiles as bows and arrows, sweet words and flattery as strategic deployment, a female general is truly to be feared!" Since ancient times, beauties have suppressed heroes, and heroes have succumbed to beauties. Is this only a modern phenomenon?</p>
<h3>Iron Dumbbells</h3>
<p>— Hu Chenzhou</p>
<p>During my school days, I never loved the subject of "physical education." As soon as I left school, life oppressed me, and I spent my days hunched over between ink bottles and pens, without even a chance to stretch my arms or kick my legs. As a result, I became thinner and weaker. Whenever I encountered someone with a chest out and belly protruding, I couldn't help but shudder, and my head would naturally bow down in front of them.</p>
<p>I was only twenty years old, but I was already so weak; this simply didn't make sense. In today's society, where individualism has reached its peak, conflicts between people are inevitable. The weak will be pressed under the buttocks of the strong and used as a stool, unable to even hum a low sound! Moreover, justice is built on the foundation of iron and blood! If others aggressively come at you with weapons, you cannot possibly meet them with a pen and say, "Come, let me reason with you!"</p>
<p>There are quite a few tools for practicing "martial arts": the "eighteen weapons," the immortal's burden, stone locks... like those heroes we often see showing off on the streets. There are also foreign boxing coaches' Chest Expanders, sandbags, etc., but I always felt that those were not convenient to practice with and were easy to get injured with. I unintentionally heard someone mention iron dumbbells. I had done dumbbell exercises in school before, although those were wooden; now I would just add a little weight.</p>
<p>Finally, I bought a pair of iron dumbbells, each weighing twelve pounds. Every day, early in the morning, before the sun had even risen, I left the bed, regardless of how low the temperature of my humble abode was due to the influence of winter. I put on a set of shorts and opened all the windows and doors! The northwest wind completed its exchange effect in my humble abode. In front was the web ball field: readily available fresh air! (I should thank its master, the gentleman in the big house over there!) From my hazy memory, I picked out the dumbbell exercises, so fragmented, so incomplete... "Up, down, left, right, forward, backward!"</p>
<p>At first, I felt that the two black things were awfully heavy. After doing a few reps, my arms immediately started to ache and I couldn't support them. Now my arms are getting thicker every day! The bodies of those iron dumbbells are already engraved with many white scars.</p>
<h3>Fighting a Path to Survival</h3>
<h3>Imperial Fragrance Misty Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In order to show that he truly had such qualifications, he had to use hunting as a kind of proof. Therefore, when he saw even the fiercest tigers or leopards, he could not show the slightest fear, otherwise those who accompanied him on the hunt would inevitably laugh at him in private. This was only a test of his courage and was not enough to show his skill in archery and horsemanship. To test his archery and horsemanship, weasels were the most suitable test, because although weasels are very small, their leg strength is extremely strong, and they run faster than anything else. Moreover, their bodies are very agile, and unless someone is proficient in archery, it is impossible to shoot them. If an emperor could often hunt weasels, his reputation for good shooting would surely be praised by the whole country! As for the use of the sword, it was different. Usually, it was prepared but not used. Only those leaders who were truly courageous and extremely skilled in martial arts, in order to make their people sincerely fear them, would deliberately abandon bows and arrows and specially ride their horses over to fight a tiger or a leopard within five steps, showing off their swordsmanship to the fullest. However, this kind of situation was very rare!"</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager's above remarks only explained to us the general situation of emperors' hunting and the reasons why they often hunted. As for what constituted a detailed program for completing a hunt, she had not yet mentioned it. We couldn't help but feel very anxious, so she got to the main point. (219)</p>
<h3>Rebuilding the Tomb of Mr. Zhou Lianxi</h3>
<p>— (Guan Wu)</p>
<p>The Song Confucian scholar Zhou Dunyi, courtesy name Maoshu, came from a family in Lianxi Township, Yingdao County, Dao Prefecture. He wrote dozens of works such as "Explanation of the Taiji Diagram" and "Tong Shu," integrating metaphysics and physics, unifying them into one. The two gentlemen of Yichuan and Mingdao were both his disciples, and he was truly the ancestor of Daoist learning. Mr. Zhou was born in the first year of Tianxi during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty and died in the sixth year of Xining during the reign of Emperor Shenzong, at the age of fifty-seven. He was buried at the foot of Lianfeng Mountain in Mount Lu, Jiangxi. His tomb had been in disrepair for many years. Bao County Magistrate of Jiujiang, Mr. Ren, in order to promote the sages and preserve historical sites, initiated the restoration. Although there were proponents and sponsors, there was no final decision. It is said that this time, the Red Swastika Society's relief team went to Jiangxi for relief. It happened that the team leader was Zhou Zongliang, a descendant of Mr. Zhou Lianxi. County Magistrate Bao occasionally talked about it with him, and he was extremely moved. Mr. Zhou generously agreed to be solely responsible for the restoration, estimated at 4,000 yuan. County Magistrate Bao has already planned specific measures and will start construction soon, and plans to build a road in front of the tomb to connect to the highway. From now on, Jiujiang will have one more scenic spot, which is also a good story.</p>
<p>Where Travels Lead</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Sightseeing Trip Encounters Fog</h3>
<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation recently purchased two of the latest Douglas seaplanes from the United States, each worth US$60,000, equivalent to about 200,000 yuan in national currency, named Guangdong and Fujian respectively, specializing in flying the Shanghai-Guangdong line, ensuring passenger safety. It was originally scheduled to test the new aircraft on January 1st of this year and invite the Chinese and Western press in this city to ride along and sightseeing. Unexpectedly, due to bad weather, it was postponed to the 3rd. On the 3rd, the weather was still not good, so it was postponed to 7:00 am on the 6th before the trip finally took place. That morning, at six o'clock, in the dim morning light, I took a car to Longhua Airport. I arrived at the airport at 6:30, and many people were already waiting in the passenger room. Mr. He Zhijing, Deputy Director of the company's business department, personally greeted us and introduced us to Mr. Dai Enji, the general manager of the company. Mr. Dai then introduced the other reporters traveling with us: Mr. Wang Jiao of the Shenshi Telegraph Agency, Ms. Luo Qian of the North-China Daily News, Mr. Paul Mendon of The Times, and Mr. Gold of the China Press, along with Mr. Dai and me, a total of six people. Then, the passengers and luggage were weighed one by one and recorded on an aircraft load sheet. Finally, pilot Fangs carefully read the load sheet and said "OK," and we began to depart. The staff in the company hurriedly handed out small paper packets to each person, containing a piece of Red Cross cotton wool and a packet of Wrigley's Spearmint gum. The cotton wool was for plugging the ears to prevent excessive vibration from the engine noise and could be tried.</p>
<p>The seaplane was parked on the water. We boarded the Fujian aircraft from the pier one after another. The passenger seats were arranged in rows of three, on the left and right sides. Miss Luo Qian went first and sat with Mr. Gold in the first row, Paul Mendon and Mr. Dai sat in the second row, and Mr. Wang and I sat in the back. At exactly 7:00, the pilot started the engine, and the plane slowly taxied on the water, going faster and faster, and the waves became higher and higher. Finally, the glass windows on both sides of the passengers were almost submerged in the water. At that instant, the plane lifted off the water and soared straight up. Looking down at the Huangpu River and the houses near Longhua, everything was clearly visible, and my heart was filled with joy.</p>
<p>In our small group, the American pilot, Fangs, seemed to be the commander-in-chief, wielding the power of life and death over the entire aircraft. The radio operator, Mr. Chen, next to him, seemed to be the head of the intelligence department, constantly communicating news with the outside world and reporting internally. Mr. Dai seemed like a university professor, constantly explaining the places we passed and the news from outside. And our group of reporters were just like students in a lecture hall, quickly taking notes of the professor's lectures. This is Hangzhou Bay, this is the coastline, these are the Zhoushan Islands, this is Zhongxiang Island, this is Zhenhai at the entrance to Ningbo. We spread out the map for reference, and the scenery below the window was our very concrete experimental field.</p>
<p>Mr. Gold was the most talkative, and his words were humorous, filling the cabin with laughter. Mr. Wang and I were old classmates from Yenching University, and we enjoyed chatting about past events even more. Mr. Dai busied himself with arrangements, taking out a few wool blankets from the luggage area in the back and asking us to cover our lower bodies. Originally, my legs and feet felt a little cold, but with the blankets, it was truly wonderful. Mr. Dai also took out Sullivan's sandwich bread, and we devoured it, truly warm and full. Sitting inside the plane, we didn't feel how fast we were going. After an hour, the pilot reported that we had already traveled 155 miles, equivalent to 465 li, which was truly unexpected.

<h3>Gold Standard Price Continues to Face High Pressure from Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>The Central Bank's Spot Sales are Quite Effective</p>
<p>Result: Continued Drop of 7.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market continued to be pressured by the foreign exchange market, with supply exceeding demand, once retreating into the 60 Yuan range. The situation was calm, and morale was still stable, mainly because the general sentiment was that the Central Bank would sell spot. Therefore, although the gold price fell, it was not enough. In the early morning, the overseas silver market reported that British and American markets both rebounded. The American "big shots" were still buying after the market closed, and British pure gold fell one penny. Exchange rates all rose. Reports stated that the US Treasury Secretary denied negotiating with China on easing silver policies. Furthermore, Reuters and the Associated Press both telegraphed that our government denied such actions, claiming that it was speculators spreading rumors. People's hearts were unsupported and weary. Before the market opened, pre-market trading opened, then retreated to 55-56 Yuan. Major players still had an appetite for buying, pushing it up to 67 Yuan. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, British and American currencies both rose, and the Customs Gold Unit fell 1.6%. The gold standard retreated to 999 Yuan. The morning opened with low prices. After opening, major players sought a balance between supply and demand, and the situation appeared calm. However, with the banks' appetite becoming blocked and the foreign exchange market hardening, a selling trend emerged, leading to a fall in prices. However, because of the general feeling that the Central Bank would sell spot, buying activity increased, allowing it to be maintained. Banks seized the opportunity to profit. The silver equalization tax was announced, rising by 0.25, totaling a slight 6%. The British exchange rate, calculated at 1 shilling 5 pence and 71875, still had room to rise, but the psychological differences between supply and demand led to struggles. Later, there were rumors that the Central Bank would sell 560 bars of spot at prices of 95 Yuan and 9.5 Yuan, causing a temporary surge. Unfortunately, Sassoon and Chinese merchants still had an appetite for selling, and the banks' appetite for taking delivery was weak. The foreign exchange market hardened again and again, falling after rising. Major players' selling became suddenly strong, and even long positions were shaken. The price fell again at noon. After closing, it once retreated within one Yuan. The afternoon market was calm, with supply and demand balanced, causing the market to fluctuate. When the initial report of Indian silver rose by 5 annas, it retreated within one Yuan. Banks took the opportunity to buy cheaply, and major players bought to cover their profits, leading to a rebound. However, because Chinese merchants and banks provided more supply, and the foreign exchange market remained loose, the Associated Press telegraphed that US Democratic Senator James advocated immediately increasing the purchase of domestic and foreign silver, causing a rise and subsequent decline. Transactions were limited. Therefore, when major players supplied, the 60 Yuan mark was immediately broken. However, because the second report of Indian silver rose by a small 3 annas, morale remained stable, and it finally stabilized. Although the day's results showed a decline, the underlying trend was still stable, inferior only to the foreign exchange market. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>

<h3>The Silver Market Recovers Vigorously, While British and American Exchanges Remain Loose and Excessive</h3>
<p>丨Sassoon, the Central Bank, and China Strive to Dump丨</p>
<p>According to foreign telegrams, London's short and long term both rose by 25, American silver rose by 125, and the forward silver price in Montreux rose by 1% to 4%. London's raw gold fell by 1 penny, the British exchange rate against the US rose by 1.375, the US against the British rose by 1.125, the British against the French rose by 13 pounds, and the US against the French rose by 625. The rumor that the US government and our country are negotiating to ease the silver purchase process has been refuted, with loud voices, and the major players still claim that the US bought in after the market closed. The exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices of 1 shilling, 4 pence, 9375 for the British exchange rate, and 34.75 yuan for the US exchange rate, which was not much different from the previous closing. However, because the morale of Chinese merchants was weak, this price was difficult to sell. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, the British exchange rate rose by 125, the US exchange rate rose by 3125, and the Customs Gold Unit fell by 1.6%. As soon as it opened, it loosened, and the process of banks scrambling to dump hardened. The exchange rate listed by HSBC showed that the British exchange rate rose and the US exchange rate rose by 125. Although Chinese merchants bought, it was difficult to stop the selling trend. Banks seized the opportunity to buy cheaply. The silver equalization tax was announced, rising by 0.25, with a levy of 6%, calculated at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 71875 for the British exchange rate, gradually settling down. The Central Bank opened a spot market, which was slightly tight for a while. Unfortunately, morale was down, and Sassoon and Chinese merchants still had an appetite for selling. After that, the situation continued to harden. In the afternoon, banks seized the opportunity to buy cheaply. However, because the Indian silver price rose by 5 annas, Chinese merchants and banks still had supply, and the situation remained hard. Finally, the Indian silver price rebounded by a small 3 annas, and the overall situation had slightly stabilized. Although the banks slightly spit out, Chinese merchants had already made up for it. The closing selling price for recent periods was 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 0625 for the British exchange rate, and 35 yuan for the US exchange rate. Compared with the previous closing, the British exchange rate was loose by 125, and the US exchange rate was hard by 25. Swaps were even more close. At present, the spot and January prices have been almost flattened. Chinese merchants sold about 50,000 pounds of shillings and 400,000 US dollars. The Central Bank and China all sold, and Sassoon also sold. There was not enough buying power. The day's transactions are recorded below.

Yesterday's market interest rates for overseas transactions were 2.8% in the morning and afternoon, a small drop of 7 points compared to the previous day. However, the head-to-head plus water consistently traded white, indicating that silver stocks have gradually become loose and excessive. In addition, spot goods are scheduled to arrive from Hong Kong soon, which has further relaxed the market atmosphere.

<h3>Jiangsu and Guangdong Regional Markets Both Rebound</h3>
<p>丨Copper Coins Stabilize丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu's small silver coins rose by 3 yuan in the early market, trading at 848 yuan, and continued to rise by 1 yuan in the afternoon market, reaching 849 yuan.

Copper coins remained the same as the previous day, at 309,000 wen. The trading volume was 38,625 strings, equivalent to 12,500 yuan in silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Lack Momentum for Price Increases</h3>
<p>The 23rd Issue Alone Sees a Price Increase of Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, the market rose and then fell. Although overseas interest rates fell rapidly, morale remained strong, but the trend felt sluggish. This was because major shorts not only did not cover their positions, but also added to them. Major longs did not swap their positions and exit, unwilling to wait for the Lunar New Year. The reasons were mainly due to silver stock concerns and avoiding risks. Therefore, although overseas interest rates fell to 2.8%, the silver stock situation remained loose for some and tight for others. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the market downturn became increasingly apparent. Financial institutions sold without end, but retail investors' appetite was limited. The market price faced this resistance, so it could not be raised. Overseas interest rates are likely to continue to fall, and the market price will likely continue to fluctuate. Yesterday, the morning's opening session continued to rise strongly. No. 50 bought a lot, and No. 11 bought more and sold less. Most of the other buyers were scattered, while No. 4 and No. 16, etc., were all sellers. No. 41 slightly reduced their holdings. Morale was extremely high, but the pressure was very heavy, so the longs still felt unable to rise. The second session saw fewer buyers, and the previous price felt lifeless. Most prices rose more and fell less, failing to be consistent. In the afternoon, although head-to-head loans were still white, the sellers were still relatively active, and the market turned to more falls and fewer rises. At the closing, the longs still reduced their holdings, and buyers were waiting and watching, so the market was uniformly weak, down 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. In the market, the psychology of the longs was relatively weak, because the major shorts had about 10 to 20 million yuan, which seemed to be deliverable. The longs were hesitant to take delivery due to silver stock concerns. However, the environment was extremely good. Liu, the representative of Hu Hanmin, would arrive in Shanghai soon. This visit would bring about substantial progress in cooperation. Overseas interest rates were gradually easing, and the 20 million yuan shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai would arrive soon, stabilizing the financial situation. Therefore, the market price would not have major fluctuations. Yesterday's market price results showed that most prices improved slightly by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and the 23rd issue's increase of 0.5 yuan was the largest. The total transaction volume was 13,635,000 yuan. The results of the overall price increases and decreases are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Sees Widespread Selling</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (9th) the New York stock market was initially firm, but later prices could not be sustained as longs sold and shorts shorted. The bond market was mixed, with the feature being the rise of US government bonds. The small exchange trended downward. Chicago grains were softened by Winnipeg, and Winnipeg's weakness was due to signs of reduced European import demand. The total daily transaction volume was 900,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Indices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn and Silver Are Tight</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market is Dull and Lifeless</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains weak and morale is unusually low. However, Indian cotton is rising sharply, but the local market is not affected much. This is because spot yarn sales are sluggish. All dealers are facing tight credit and have a dull appetite for buying. Therefore, although foreign cotton prices are rising, it is difficult to arouse excitement. However, Tongcheng Company has no intention of taking delivery this month.</p>
<h3>Marked Yarn is Difficult to Revive</h3>
<p>Before the opening of the marked yarn market in the morning, everyone expected it to rise by several jiao due to the soaring price of foreign cotton. However, the initial session saw the near-month rise by 1.2 jiao, quickly stabilizing. The morale in the market was still difficult to boost. By the second and third sessions, it was heard that there were not many spot yarn sales and the cotton market was falling. As a result, the near-month fell by 0.2 jiao, and the mid-month rose by 1.3 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that Tongcheng Company had no intention of taking delivery this month at around 185 yuan, and was gradually closing out their long positions. However, Japanese merchants entered, dumping the far-month for swaps, so the market did not fluctuate much. As a result, each month fell by another 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 jiao. It was found that Jifeng sold 350 bales, Gengfeng sold 1,150 bales, Tongji sold 200 bales, Junchang sold 600 bales, Daji sold 950 bales, and Taichang sold 200 bales. Meiji bought 850 bales, Changfeng bought 600 bales, Jinchang bought 550 bales, Yuanda bought 500 bales, and Xincheng bought 1,000 bales. The day's highest and lowest prices and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Spot Sales Improve</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales have become increasingly sluggish. It was found that all dealers bought a total of 350 bales throughout the day. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The amount purchased by each dealer is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 115 Changsha 90 Shantou 40</p>
<p>Sichuan 25 Nanyang 5 Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Datong 5 Inland 38 Peer 15</p>
<p>Zhenjiang 10</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Tends Towards Dumping</h3>
<p>The cotton market is also unexciting, and the situation is quite weak. This is because credit remains tight and there is unsettling news from the producing areas, so most people tend to sell. However, the Indian cotton Omura type soared by 7 rupees and a half, but the Shanghai market price was unaffected. This shows the dullness and lack of morale.</p>
<h3>Marked Cotton Rises in the Morning and Falls in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The opening of the marked cotton market in the morning was still high, due to the sudden surge in Indian cotton prices by 5.7 Wang Robi. The reason for the surge was said to be weak inventories and dwindling sources, causing a short squeeze and soaring prices. However, the local market atmosphere failed to be shaken, because the financial situation remained tight and the yarn market softened. Those holding goods were willing to sell at lower prices due to the impact of tight credit. Furthermore, Shanghai Huamian currently has a huge inventory of 500,000 dan, and gold prices have fallen slightly, so morale has failed to flourish. Each month rose slightly by 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was some callback in Indian cotton prices, and the market atmosphere dissipated. Each month fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. It was found that Dafu sold 700 dan, Junchang sold 1,000 dan, Renfeng sold 2,400 dan, Yuanxingchang sold 700 dan, Changji sold 600 dan, and Changfeng sold 2,200 dan. Yuanda bought 1,000 dan, Dafeng bought 800 dan, Yichang bought 700 dan, Changhe bought 700 dan, Senkang bought 1,800 dan, and Xincheng bought 2,000 dan. The day's highest and lowest prices and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Total 663,000</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Has Arrived and Sales Are Good</h3>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is scattered, and factory demand has stagnated due to the poor yarn market. The sources include 1,610 bales of Yaohua and 50 bales of Tonghua.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Decline by Four to Five Points</h3>
<p>Long Positions Liquidated...Southern Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was sluggish and inactive. Despite the previous day's report indicating the government would no longer dump cotton and that the flow of cotton into storage had decreased, this had no impact here. At the opening, prices for all months rose by one to three points due to favorable news from Liverpool. Subsequently, long positions were liquidated, southern sellers emerged, and spot merchants sold off due to sluggish demand, leading to a gradual reversal. Spot cotton demand showed slight improvement, but the textile market remained quiet. At closing, the market was flat and weak, with spot prices down five points and futures down three to nine points. The British cotton market was stable, with spot prices down one point and futures up one or two points. Indian cotton futures saw buying from Japanese traders and selling from Indian traders, with the Pingor up 4.75 rupees, the Oomra up 7.5 rupees, and the Broach up 5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (9th telegraph)</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to a Bombay dispatch, the opening forecast for Broach cotton on the 10th was 242 biro, down 2 rupees 7.5 cents from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Sin Fung Foreign Firm, the cotton deadlock has not yet been resolved. Farmers and the government are still not releasing cotton. Meanwhile, preparations for the next planting season are underway. Those who are impatient with long positions are gradually liquidating. The ambiguity in legislation before the Supreme Court's ruling and the lack of production quotas in the Peng Kehai case make it difficult to expand the scope of transactions. It is reported that there have been large transactions in fertilizers and agricultural implements.</p>
<h3>Trend of Hedging Sales of Grain Futures and Flour Gradually Subsides</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month showed a pattern of first weakening and then stabilizing. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were around 12.3 cents lower for Chicago wheat and 8 cents to 16 cents lower for Canadian wheat. At the opening, the quotes for foreign wheat were lower, and the previous day's order of one ship of foreign wheat further weakened sentiment for all months, down by one to one and a half cents from the previous day. However, there were few factory hedges, and the customer support was not weak, so the decline was limited. By the afternoon opening, since factories were not issuing and hedgers were also taking a wait-and-see approach, trading was light and the market stabilized. As the settlement date for the Lunar New Year approached, customer trading mostly stopped, leading to a consolidation pattern in the later stages. As a result, the current month was unchanged, February was down slightly by 0.25 cents, March was down slightly by 0.75 cents, April was down slightly by 0.25 cents, May was down slightly by 0.25 cents, and June was down slightly by 0.05 cents.</p>
<h3>Stagnation and Weakness in Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally quiet after the opening in the morning. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were down by 8 cents to 12.3 cents. At the opening, the market for each month was stagnant, and trading was light, with prices down by 2 to 3 cents from the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the market remained weak due to some foreign wheat hedging, which dampened sentiment. The smaller moves in the distant months were due to this. As a result, the current month was down 0.3 cents, February was down 0.5 cents, March was down 0.4 cents, and April was down 0.5 cents. In the spot wheat market, the standard grade was weak, with secondary grades down 1-2 cents. Shandong Suzhou Guide wheat was quoted at 4.034 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 3.956 yuan, and Liuhe wheat at 4.01 yuan, secondary at 0.98 yuan, totaling 5,000 bags, which were reportedly handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat spot prices are stable. Purchases by factories and the Far East, the impending shipment of wheat from Argentina and Australia, and the ample reserves of Canadian wheat will all affect future prices. The United States does not lack wheat, but will only reduce the surplus.</p>

<h3>Speculators Emerge in Rice Futures Market</h3>
<p>Nervous Sentiment...Continued Weakness Across All Boards</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was even weaker. A ship of newly arrived Iraeli Tapi Simara rice arrived (this was loaded in November and is the last ship for November; there are still two ships for December that have not arrived and are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon). The market has ample reserves and new arrivals are continuous. Although sales are active, sentiment is very nervous. Yesterday, over 4,000 bags of spot rice were offered, and prices continued to fall by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Sellers in the rice futures market continued to seek buyers, while speculators are nervous and eager to sell. Buyers are taking a wait-and-see approach. Only 300 tons of Mindon Saigon rice for April were offered at 4.85 yuan, but there were 2-3,000 tons transacted in the gray market at lower prices than the market offers. This further panicked customer speculators seeking to sell. However, new transactions have stopped yesterday. If the floating inventory in the market is cleared, the market may stabilize again. The arrival and inventory of customer Indica rice are both low, and merchants are still not willing to sell off completely. Over 2,000 bags were offered yesterday, and spot prices were affected by the rice market, also falling by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sunny Weather Causes Downriver Rice to Drop Again by 0.2 to 0.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over thirty sources from various regions arrived (totaling nearly 6,000 shi). The market situation has carried over from the previous day's decline, and coupled with the clear weather, sentiment has softened further, resulting in sluggish sales. Prices have steadily decreased, falling by about 0.3 yuan. Prices for various late Indica rice and thick japonica rice have all depreciated by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Looking at the overall situation, there is a sense of listlessness, and there is concern that the market may weaken further. Tuyang Jian rice is in relatively good shape due to a shortage of goods in recent days, but the Yinbian rice price still followed the Japonica market and fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over forty sources from various regions downriver arrived. In terms of sales, white japonica rice and various pointed early thin rice were sluggish. Only Yinbian rice was slightly transacted, with total sales estimated at over 1,000 shi. In terms of market prices, high-quality white japonica rice was down by a small number of cents, medium-quality rice was unchanged, Yinbian rice was down by 0.1 yuan, Yangjian rice was down by a few cents, thin rice was down by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and the remaining goods were generally weak.</p>
<h3>Soybean Sales Turn Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market declined by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan due to the fact that although the Anhui donation to the provincial government could not be avoided, the higher authorities had dispatched supervisors to abolish it within a limited time, which caused some nervous sentiment and led to an initial drop. In addition, sales in various regions have been sluggish in the past two days. Valuing a large amount of Yangtze River soybeans, and under the circumstances of tight credit, the market turned down due to various reasons. Yesterday, 1,500 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans were transacted, with prices ranging from 3.63 yuan to 3.65 yuan. 200 bags of Hankou late soybeans were transacted at 3.42 yuan. Two cars of Dalian Siping Street soybeans were quoted at 4.05 yuan. One car of Yingzhou aged soybeans was quoted at 3.8 yuan, and 500 bags of Guide soybeans were quoted at 3.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Rise by 0.1 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained tight. The guild's price fixing for #24 coarse sand white ordinary spot sugar, which had been quoted at 18.95 yuan the day before but not transacted, was fixed at 19 yuan yesterday. Transshipment goods were at 5.4 yuan, up 0.1 yuan from before. #8-9 Dutch red sugar spot goods were at 13.9 yuan, and transshipment goods in bonded warehouses were at 4.8 yuan. Taikoo sugar B mark was at 19.3 yuan, and the factory's refined white sugar #1 was at 18.2 yuan. Due to a shortage of goods, Chao traders offered over 1,000 bags of newly arrived Chaoqing, with Tizhuangqing at 11 yuan, Huanggangqing at 10.6 to 10.4 yuan, Bannanqing at 10.23 yuan, and Longgangqing at 10 to 9.9 yuan, up 0.2 yuan from before. Guangdong traders offered dozens of baskets of Changan Pianqing at 9.8 yuan, and Jian traders offered hundreds of pieces of Quanzhouqing at 9.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Longan from Shima is Short Due to Scarcity</h3>
<p>The dried longan market in Shima has recently seen rising land prices and a limited supply of goods. It is reported that the branded goods have already been cleared, and merchants' inventory is also limited. Therefore, there is a significant shortage now. It has been found that the market price for ordinary branded goods has reached 54 yuan. If goods with bright red color, good quality, dryness, and large size arrive, prices can be further increased. It is expected that a small number of shipments will be delivered later to meet sales needs.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tinplate Prices Rise by Over 1 Yuan</h3>
<p>The tinplate market has been quite good recently. Although transactions have not increased due to the end of the year, quoted prices are brisk and the supply of new arrivals is scarce. Therefore, the market is exceptionally firm. Current market quotes are as follows (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>90 lbs American 16.25 180 lbs American 33.00</p>
<p>90 lbs German 16.00 180 lbs German 32.75</p>
<p>90 lbs French 15.75 180 lbs French 32.50</p>
<p>100 lbs American 17.00 200 lbs American 35.00</p>
<p>100 lbs German 16.50 200 lbs German 34.00</p>
<p>100 lbs French 16.50 200 lbs French 33.50</p>
<p>Compared to the previous day, single-linked goods are up 0.5 to 0.6 yuan, and double-linked goods are up 1.1 to 1.2 yuan. Aside from sporadic openings by retail stores, there have been no reports of large transactions. According to industry insiders, overseas quoted prices are rising daily, and credit in the local market is very tight. If those holding goods can hold on for one or two weeks, then this market will definitely open up. It is found that only 200-300 boxes were transacted in the market yesterday.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhenmei Green Tea from Wuyuan Shows Slight Movement in European Sales</h3>
<p>The sales of Zhenmei green tea from the northern route of Wuyuan have been sluggish. Yesterday, Jinlong Shuixing and other firms received telegrams from Africa requesting purchases. 170 boxes have already been purchased. Sprout tea is quoted at 110 yuan, and ordinary tea is sold for 70 to 73 yuan, which is 3-4 yuan lower than at the end of last year. Needle tea and Xiumei green tea were also purchased by British firms such as Yingzhuang Xiehe and Dude in the market yesterday. However, sales prices still declined because Chinese merchants are eager to sell off.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Newly Produced Raw Oil Scarce in Wuhan Market</h3>
<p>Since the price surge in raw oil subsided, the situation has gradually become peaceful. However, harvests have not been very good in various places this winter, so the local supply is extremely scarce. Compared to previous years, new goods from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Jiangxi would have already arrived in succession, but it is unexpected that all production areas report low supply and high prices, resulting in no arrivals from Taizhou and Wenzhou to date, and only nearly a hundred pieces of Jiangxi oil arriving. Therefore, the customer goods are almost extinct. Such a harvest situation is rarely seen. Merchants previously procured a batch from Yichang at a reasonable price, but the quality of the goods was slightly uneven. According to reports from the Wuhan market in recent days, the market remains firm, also due to weak arrivals. Although there are no large transactions in the sales market, sporadic sales are not weak. The initial quote for newly produced Zhongjing oil from the head plate the other day was 11 taels 8 qian of Caobao silver per piece. At this price, the cost to arrive in Shanghai would be around 20 yuan, but the current selling price of Zhongjing oil without wood in Shanghai is only 19.5-19.6 yuan, which is not in line with the cost. Therefore, the market outlook is very stable, but sales are not as good as in previous years because Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are both drought-stricken areas and candle sales are also unusually sluggish. It is truly said that the harvest determines the sales.</p>
<h3>Woolen Overcoating Fabric Affected by the Weather</h3>
<p>Woolen overcoating fabric is currently in its peak season, but sales are actually slower than in the autumn. Whether it is multicolored and iridescent fabric, double-sided or single-sided flocked, dotted, checkered, herringbone, or twill fabric, the trends are all loose and weak. The biggest reason is indeed the impact of the warm weather. According to this year's weather, it is sometimes sunny and sometimes rainy, unlike the deep cold winters of previous years, which has caused sales of this type of woolen overcoating fabric to slow down. Customers have reduced purchases of medium and Western-style thick woolen overcoats.</p>

<h3>Emphasis and Exaggeration in Modern Art</h3>
<p>— He Jin</p>
<p>Having spent ten years after the Great War groping and feeling suffocated by the loss of all methods, the people of the 1930s were indescribably happy when they suddenly saw the emergence of a new theory and new things. It was this power of revelry that blinded their comprehension and called them to pursue the light regardless. Thus, when the social system presented an unusually rapid transformation in a sudden manner, the stimulation they received was simply indescribable. All order, morality, and religion were shattered into pieces by a swift "no way" bomb. And the people living in these fragments also lost everything, leaving only naked primitivity.</p>
<p>At the same time, science and industry presented astonishing developments, and all things sufficient to produce new stimulation came into being: skyscrapers, airplanes, high-speed locomotives, speedboats...</p>
<p>In this contradictory conflict between economic depression and the rapid advancement of science and industry, some of the people of the 1930s inevitably had only one path to take: frenzy! They constantly pursued new stimuli to numb the current hardships. They only needed action, action, action—meaningless primitive action.</p>
<p>This formed what Americans called "Fast Life."</p>
<p>This tendency, expressed in modern art, is emphasis (Strong Tone) and exaggeration (Hypdrbole).</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, what people in the 1930s yearned for was no longer meticulous fine-brush paintings, but the emphasized sketches and woodcuts of the Expressionists; no longer boating on the moon and lingering in low murmurs, but the speeding of speedboats in raging waves; no longer the seclusion of sounds, but the rapid playing of voices with extremely high frequencies. At the same time, due to the sweeping of "fast life," people no longer had time (or rather, did not have the mood) to appreciate medieval fine-brush paintings. They only demanded cartoons (Carton) in which certain characteristics were expressed particularly clearly with exaggerated techniques. They no longer wanted to savor the meticulous descriptive texts in newspapers; they could only read one or two summary headlines!</p>
<p>This technique, expressed in modern art, includes Picasso's paintings, E. Nolde's woodcuts, and common cartoons in painting; Richard Strauss's symphonies in music; and Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner's novels, which worship primitive, naked action, and J. M. March's poems in literature.</p>
<p>If it is not denied that it is possible to interpret art with life, then the art of the 1930s perfectly represents the lives of modern people: emphasis, exaggeration! And this emphasis and exaggeration were only accepted in this crazy decade of the 1930s. Just look at the pre-war salons discarding Picasso, and pre-war people saying that Gertrude Stein's chapters could only be understood by herself and no one else. But look at the post-war 1930s: seeing people trying to imitate Picasso and Stein, one can understand.</p>
<p>Therefore, this emphasis and exaggeration are not only not "dazzlingly strange" as commonly said; on the contrary, they truly represent the "human suffering" of the 1930s.</p>
<h3>A Certain Trip</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>I ran to Foshan Town with a large group of people of all kinds without a profession...</p>
<p>"Hanging out" with Cantonese people is a fun game with a strong flavor. It exceeds solidified comfort, vulgar enjoyment, and stale leisure, and is a tense adventure mixed with human sympathy. Everyone stares at their target with the agile and shrewd eyes of a hunter, making all kinds of beautiful and fanciful plans; at night, they gamble greedily until dawn. During the day, they spend all their money lavishly on food. A landlord's son from Yangjiang County, who was preparing to get a small job in the Minding Inspection Office, a character whose name seemed to be Gu Gengzhi, proposed a trip to me when he realized there was no hope at all.</p>
<p>"Wu Dakui, do you know what Yangjiang County is best known for? It's not leather suitcases and leather pillows, those are all fakes! It's the people who eat everywhere. That's really amazing!" He said this and patted his chest, as if he couldn't burp out a full stomach.</p>
<p>He opened his two old Chinese-style leather suitcases, picked up two or three newly pasted decoration boxes, which contained a dozen or more medicine bottles. He pointed to the boxes for me to see. Thousands or hundreds of small glass bottles, each two or three inches high, were filled with black oily fake medicine, scattered disorderly like two boxes of scattered large bullets: and he boasted to me:</p>
<p>"Prevention is better than cure, that's what this is! Don't look down on it, thinking it's just some fake medicine oil! Actually, where can you find real medicine?" He smiled affectionately at me and continued, "With it, I can go to any place I want, and most of the time there is not much difficulty. And, and..."</p>
<h3>Distinguishing Characters and Distinguishing Words (I)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Guest: Ah, the level of Chinese of young people nowadays is really getting worse with each generation!</p>
<p>Host: Hmm, haven't seen you in a few days, you've turned into a "people's hearts are not as good as they used to be" type! "People's hearts are not as good as they used to be" is truly an ancient saying, there is such a sentence in the oldest Egyptian inscriptions ten thousand years ago. When you were carrying your schoolbag and studying at school, those old predecessors touching their beards were already saying: "The level of Chinese is really getting worse with each generation"; and now it's your turn to say it.</p>
<p>Guest: Brother, I'm not here to argue with you. I just flipped through those students' test papers on your desk, and some wrote "分岐" (fen qi, divergence) as "分岐" (fen qi), "生熟" (sheng shu, raw and cooked) as "生孰" (sheng shu), "蹤跡" (zong ji, trace) as "從跡" (cong ji), "著明" (zhu ming, notable) as "箸明" (zhu ming); some wrote "九仭" (jiu ren, nine ren, a unit of length) as "九軔" (jiu ren), "兩造" (liang zao, both parties) as "兩曹" (liang cao), "茫茫" (mang mang, vast) as "芒芒" (mang mang), "歌頌" (ge song, sing praises) as "歌訟" (ge song, singing accusations); such a series of wrongly written characters is something we have never seen before, isn't this the decline of young people's Chinese level?</p>
<p>Host: Haha, haha...</p>
<p>Guest: What are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? Am I wrong?</p>
<p>Host: I remembered a story that is quite similar to what you said, and I couldn't help but laugh. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, there were two chief examiners, one surnamed Zhuang and one surnamed Ju. Zhuang was mediocre, and Ju was confused. Someone composed couplets using Du Fu's poems to mock them: "A dream unknown when will awaken, chrysanthemum flowers from now on need not bloom." After Ju finished the exam, he returned to Beijing and complained to Chen Jushan, the vice minister, "The Hangzhou personnel are not understanding, how can Ju connect to chrysanthemum?" Chen Taipu remained silent and did not answer. Ju asked him again, and Chen Taipu said, "I am thinking here about the phrase "chrysanthemum has yellow flowers" in the Book of Rites Monthly Orders!" Ju felt greatly ashamed. (See Miscellaneous Notes from the Two Kinds of Autumn Rain Hut). Now, please don't blush, let me explain them to you one by one. This sees the Explanation of Writing, look at the footnote under the character "岐" (qi, divergent): "Mount Qi, the mountain has two forks. Therefore, it is named." "岐" (qi) is the original character, and later a vulgar character "歧" (qi) was specially made to mean two forks. This here is the Book of Rites, look at the Ritual Evolution chapter: "Smelling the minced meat, cooking the millet." Explanation of Writing: "孰 (shu), cooking food." Commonly written as "熟 (shu)." Look again: "從跡 (cong ji)"'s "從 (cong)" is the original character, but "蹝 (xi)" is the vulgar character; "箸明 (zhu ming)"'s "箸 (zhu)" is the original character, but "著 (zhu)" is the vulgar character. Look again: "九仭 (jiu ren)," Mencius writes "digging a well nine ren"; "曹 (cao)," Explanation of Writing, the two prisons of a prison are also called cao. The Records of the Grand Historian writes it as "two encounters." 茫茫 (mang mang), in Fu: "芒 (mang). Mang Yu's footprints," Shang Ode:: "The flood is vast 芒芒 (mang mang)." all written as "芒芒 (mang mang)." Chu Ci: "Without care, he does not know where he steps (zhi)," Wang note: "Dan is taken also." "耽芒 (dan mang)," commonly written as "渺茫 (miao mang)." "訟 (song)" Explanation of Writing: "訟 (song), to contend, says 'sing accusation'. 頌 (song), appearance also. 容 (rong), containing also. Now "sing accusation" is written as "sing praise," and "praise appearance" is written as "appearance," all are vulgar errors. Brother, who is reading wrongly written characters? Who is writing wrongly written characters?</p>
<p>Guest: Oh! So I'm wrong?</p>
<p>Under his supervision and command, we abandoned our companions and set off without letting anyone know. Our destination was Gaoyao County, and our journey was more than 400 li of uneven mountain and water roads. He seemed very familiar with all the paths and went straight to Sanshui Division after passing Jinmaoding Mountain and Kuigang. I had diarrhea and took a ferry back alone, separating from him.</p>
<p>When walking, we were as slow as snails. Gu Gengzhi praised everything he saw, seemingly very fond of this kind of life. One night, we stayed in a small village's Doumu Temple. The shrine was very simple, without any light. He said to me cheerfully:</p>
<p>"Moreover, one person cannot take care of others well and also take care of themselves well. There must be something stuck there, everyone is equally stupid and can't come up with a solution. Don't you think so? So if you want to bite someone, don't just make a show of wanting to bite, that will definitely cause others to raise a wooden stick and beat you half to death. Bite down, and bite deep, right into the bone! The one you bite will know that they shouldn't yell out, and they have to pretend that nothing happened!"</p>
<p>Those women who liked to buy medicine proved these words to be true. One of them bought a bottle of medicine oil, opened it, and used her finger to apply a bit to her temple, immediately praising the peculiar efficacy of the medicine oil to the remaining women and the farmers who were watching idly.</p>
<p>"This is the good character of the Chinese people, my great disciple, let's go."</p>
<p>Gu Gengzhi said to me as he packed up the medicine box. So I picked up those luggage, sang Cantonese opera all the way, said thank you to everyone, and stepped into another village...</p>
<p>People sometimes have to live like this.</p>
<h3>Loneliness</h3>
<p>— Ma Xingye</p>
<p>Following over a month of continuous rain, the sky is so low, Nanjing has become a pot, and I am floating on the cold water in the pot. Lately, I've gradually felt an irredeemable sense of desolation. No friends come on Sundays. If I were to seek friends myself, Nanjing is an ice block to me. I cannot, nor am I willing to, be imprisoned on this ice block. I spent a Sunday with the doors tightly shut. At three in the afternoon, I turned on the electric light, the inside of the house as desolate as the outside. The electric light cast a pale glow on the newly tidied desk.</p>
<p>For the past half year, my emotions have been poor. What you earnestly hope for is intimacy, but when you encounter it, it immediately turns into noisy annoyance. You also earnestly hope for tranquility, but when there is tranquility, it immediately turns into desolate loneliness. Both noise and loneliness are very difficult to cope with. My nerves are gradually weakening. Rather than struggling and enduring in noise, it is better to lock myself in loneliness, to be frozen in desolation. I picked up Russell's (Conquest of Happiness), but my eyes kept wandering, unable to focus. So I pressed my index finger against my right cheek, closed my eyes, and pretended to sleep. Outside the window, it was still drizzling.</p>
<p>I remember this heart that has followed me for over twenty years, being enveloped in a sticky, ashen "loneliness," it has happened more than once. However, lately, I've become more aware of this sticky, ashen film. Last year, when the university had its summer vacation, and I was still attending summer school in a foreign land, when summer school ended and even the old ladies and gentlemen had left the university town, I also discovered my heart was locked in loneliness. However, you could go to the tennis court and toss a ball with the landlord's young children, you could sit in the rocking chair in front of the door, watching wisps of smoke rising from the chimney of the opposite house, you could wait for the newspaper boy to throw the rolled-up evening paper in front of your chair, and you could even take out a pencil to guess crossword puzzles. None of these things can be done now, and doing them would be too childish. I am too far from childhood.</p>
<p>Although the fire in the stove is not very big, I am unhappy with my stove for other reasons. This stove doesn't allow one to play with the fire properly. If it were an open fireplace, if it were burning wood blocks, I could use tongs to stir the red-hot wood blocks, causing golden sparks to continuously fly out. The fire could temporarily warm and redden one's face. Because I am playing with the fire, I wouldn't be afraid of getting too close and overheating. Descartes, in front of his stove, used his meditation and contemplation to understand the principle of the impermanence of creation. I absolutely do not want to use my brain like him. I just want the small sparks to relieve my loneliness.</p>
<p>If this stove were made of red clay, burning charcoal, it would be more interesting. The charcoal would crackle and pop, and sometimes suddenly explode, startling people, which could break this too-congealed silence. Moreover, I could boil some tea. A friend from Hangzhou recently sent me a can of good tea leaves. However, I would have to use tap water. You can never find any good spring water in Nanjing. I don't drink alcohol, so of course I can't boil wine to console my loneliness. Even if I were to boil tea, with such a dull and stupid stove, how could it brew good tea?</p>
<p>Gradually, it is dusk. Loneliness becomes even heavier. The newspaper vendor delivers the Shenbao, and a few muddy footprints are imprinted on the clean floor.</p>
<h3>Smile (1)</h3>
<p>— By Lawrence of England, translated by Tang Xiru</p>
<p>It was night again when he arrived at the "Blue Sisters" convent, chosen by Ophelia for her retirement. He was led into the prioress's room in this magnificent convent. She silently stood up, bowed to him, and lowered her eyes to look at him. Then she said in French:</p>
<p>"I am very sorry to tell you that she died this afternoon."</p>
<p>He was stunned, but did not feel much pain, only stared blankly into the void with his handsome, cold, monk-like face.</p>
<p>The prioress gently placed her soft white, beautiful hand on his arm, leaned close to him, and looked up at his face.</p>
<p>"Be brave!" she said softly. "Be brave, can't you?"</p>
<p>He stepped back a few paces. He was always terrified when a woman leaned so close to him. The prioress, even though she wore the voluminous habit, was still very feminine.</p>
<p>"I am very brave!" he replied in English. "May I see her?"</p>
<p>The prioress rang a bell, and a young nun ran out. Her face was very pale, but in her brown eyes, there was a kind of innocence and mischief. The old woman murmured an introduction, and the young woman gravely gave him a slight bow. But Matthew stretched out his hand, as if a man had reached his last shred of hope. The young nun slipped her soft white hand out of her sleeve, and shyly slid one hand into his, completely as docile as a sleeping little bird.</p>
<p>He crawled out from his melancholy, unfathomable shade. He thought, "What a beautiful hand!"</p>
<p>They walked along a beautiful but serene long corridor. Tapping on a door, Matthew walked as if in a fog, but still aware of the beautiful volume of the two women's black skirts, moving with soft, rustling haste in front of him.</p>
<p>When the door opened, he was stunned. He saw that in this high, magnificent room, many wax candles were burning around the white bed. A nun was sitting beside the candles. When she raised her head from her prayer book, her face under the white hood was somber and simple. Then she stood up, a robust woman. She bowed slightly to him. Matthew saw her dusky milky white hands, twisting a string of beads on her magnificent blue satin chest.</p>
<p>The three nuns gathered together silently. But as they went to the head of the bed, the pleats of their silk black skirts were still rustling, feminine. The prioress leaned down and, with the most graceful movement, lifted the white linen face covering from the dead body's face.</p>
<p>Matthew saw the dead and beautiful serenity on his wife's face. Suddenly, deep in his heart, a kind of emotion like laughter was stirring. His throat made a slight sound, and an extraordinary smile ran across his face.</p>
<p>The three nuns, in the flickering, rapidly and warmly trembling candlelight, like a Christmas tree, were constantly revealing a look of utmost sympathy beneath their hoods, looking kindly at him. They were like a mirror. Six eyes suddenly took on a kind of fearful surprise, then changed, bewildered, turning into a strange expression. On the faces of the three nuns, who had been looking helplessly at him in the candlelight, a strange, involuntary smile began to seep out. On these three faces, the same smile bloomed so differently, like three delicate flowers. On the pale face of the young nun, the smile was almost painful, with a mischievous, intoxicated meaning. But on the face of the nun watching over the dead body, the mature, dark-haired woman with straight eyebrows, there appeared a pagan smile, slow, with an infinitely cunning meaning in its decaying, humorous sense. This was an Etruscan smile: cunning, shameless, unanswerable.</p>

<h3>Zhao Xinbo Executed, Helpless</h3>
<p>The damned Zhao Xinbo has now been executed by the Japanese. It is regrettable that Zhao Xinbo did not die under our national law, but at the hands of Japanese warlords. But to put it more bluntly, Zhao Xinbo did not die under our national law, but at the hands of Japanese warlords, and is especially damned.</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo-based newspaper's Shenyang dispatch, "The notorious traitor Zhao Xinbo was invited by Hishikari under the pretext of a banquet after returning from Japan to investigate constitutional government. After Zhao arrived, he was immediately executed." It is reported that there were four reasons for his death, and one of the four was that "Zhao mistakenly regarded the puppet organization as a genuine country. Therefore, when Manchus in the puppet organization were constantly deferring to the Japanese, he reprimanded them to their faces, causing the Manchus in the puppet organization to resent him." Zhao's death was due to this. The Japanese organized the puppet Manchukuo as a tool to deceive the world, a game of manipulating the Manchus. Therefore, all political power was in the hands of the Japanese. However, some traitors mistakenly believed that the Japanese had special goodwill towards the puppet Manchukuo. They celebrated and their faces were filled with joy, often taking it upon themselves to be loyal to the Qing dynasty and restore the Manchu Qing. They were truly dreaming a great dream.</p>
<p>There are quite a few traitors who are still dreaming this dream. It is said that the puppet Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu and his ilk also hold this view. Although they are now controlled by the Japanese, they also want to organize a genuine puppet Manchukuo country in the future. I think it would be best to dispel this idea. Zhao Xinbo is an example. It would be better to be obedient and quick to directly pledge allegiance to the Japanese, to become docile subjects of Japan, and not to sleep in the drum, dreaming of restoring the Manchu Qing.</p>
<p>After Zhao Xinbo was executed, the general members of the puppet organization who relied on Zhao for support were all crestfallen and extremely pitiful. In fact, these kinds of shrimp soldiers and crab generals are pitiful but not worth pitying. Zhao Xinbo was one of the giants among the traitors, and still couldn't see the wind, wanting to take it upon himself to organize a genuine puppet Manchukuo country, dreaming a spring dream. As for the general mob, they are even more unworthy of mention. But this is an opportunity for them to realize, so that they will not have this dream again in the future.</p>
<p>As for the cause of Zhao Xinbo's death announced by the Japanese, accusing Zhao of communicating with the interior is naturally absurd. As the saying goes, if you want to condemn someone, you can always find a pretext. Even if Zhao's current aim is to restore the Manchu Qing, he would never want to communicate with the interior. Even if he is not loyal to the Qing dynasty, as a traitor, his name is already very famous, and people in the interior would never want to associate with him. Therefore, Zhao's death is to kill the chicken to scare the monkeys. It is an example for traitors. I advise Zheng Xiaoxu and his ilk not to dream of restoring the Qing dynasty again.</p>
<h3>After the Autumn Harvest</h3>
<p>— Inside</p>
<p>As soon as it was light, the golden light of the sun gradually shone from behind the eastern mountains, illuminating this desolate hillside. The bleak autumn scenery was revealed here.</p>
<p>Gui Lang's pale, tired face looked particularly sallow in the morning sunlight. Since yesterday, he had run dozens of miles. His legs, heavily stepping on the hillside path, walked step by step towards the city.</p>
<p>For several years, the thousand steps of land rented by Gui Lang, the annual harvest, could be enough for his household expenses and rent, but this year, the sky was early, and the fields around Gongjia Town were all damaged by the sun. It hadn't rained for more than a month, and the large stream in front of the town was so dry that there was no water at all. Gui Lang's field, although close to the eastern neighbor of the large stream, was the same. The soil was cracked with streaks of marks, and the rice seedlings were withered and died. This declared despair for his autumn harvest this year, as desperate as the people of Gongjia Town.</p>
<p>The sky finally rained, but it brought the autumn climate.</p>
<p>Gui Lang, who was already pale and thin, is now even paler and more worried. In previous years, after this autumn harvest, in addition to paying the landlord's rent, he could barely get through this remaining winter. But this year, everything in front of him has changed.</p>
<p>Time is passing day by day, and the landlord has come to urge him three times in a row. Tomorrow, the fourth scheduled date is coming. This made Gui Lang feel even more depressed and urgent. Because of the approaching fourth rent period, Gui Lang has been running around trying to find a way for the past few days, but autumn harvest is hopeless for everyone in Gongjia Town, who else can help whom?</p>
<p>Several days of running around, all he got was despair, which made Gui Lang's heart even more anxious. He didn't sleep all night last night, and his head was a little dizzy, but tomorrow, the fourth scheduled date is coming. As soon as it was light, he walked out of Gongjia Town with a dizzy head and tired, weak legs, and stepped onto the path on the hillside leading to the city.</p>
<p>But when Gui Lang came back, he had an even more sad and decadent face, and slowly, he stepped onto the dead and silent path on the hillside again. At this time, he was filled with 120,000 points of fatigue, his footsteps showed even more weakness, but his heart, that anxious heart, was jumping violently.</p>
<p>The streets of the town, the shops were lit with kerosene lamps. Gui Lang entered the town at this time. He had run more than fifty miles of mountain roads since morning, but he hadn't eaten anything in his stomach. His legs were simply numb. At this time, he walked a few steps and stopped on the street, looking towards his home. Slowly, turning a few corners, he finally saw his dilapidated tile house, which was about to become someone else's property, and he sighed like a fool at the dark, leaden sky.</p>
<p>"How is it? You ran so tired, did you borrow anything?"</p>
<p>Gui Lang's wife, looking at Gui Lang's appearance, asked very anxiously and sadly. But Gui Lang, he. Shook his head with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>On the next day, the people who collected the rent for the fourth time came, but Gui Lang, walked into another world in the late night. Only his woman and son, were crying and scolding there.</p>
<h3>Recalling Old Times in a Year of Famine</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>丨丨Eating Row Meals丨丨</p>
<p>"Eating row meals," on the one hand, is an event like the Shanghai people say "it's fun to come and see," and on the other hand, it is the most tragic expression of people's misfortune.</p>
<p>I once witnessed this scene when I was very young. I can't remember the year, but I only remember that year there was also a drought. In the vast countryside, the drought was so bad that even drinking water became a problem. As for filling one's stomach with "eating," of course, there was no way to solve it. So the tragicomedy of eating row meals was played out.</p>
<p>The facts were strung together like this: Whether they are relatives or friends, they are usually familiar and get along well. But at this time, everyone couldn't care about anything. Everyone put down their usual faces and gathered together in a formation-like team, led by one or two leaders with more reliable leads. The order was very good, and they were very harmonious and friendly. When they arrived at a family's house, they dispersed and searched out all the things that could fill their stomachs from the whole family, cooked them, and everyone politely divided and ate them until there was not a single grain left. Then they went to the second family, and according to the original method, ate them one by one.</p>
<p>People's lives in the famine were only maintained in this way.</p>
<p>The name is "eating row meals," but in reality, there is not much rice to eat. As far as I remember, they usually drank porridge, because the famine was too severe. Ordinary wealthy families also became poor people. Everything they had was only enough for a large group of people to drink a few meals of porridge. Some could only find some miscellaneous grains, and they were also considered "eating row meals" in a sloppy way.</p>
<p>Here, there are several situations that are worth praising.</p>
<p>First, is the revelry of the children. They were originally ruled by the "naive gods," and didn't know what to call a "year of abundance," or what to call a "year of famine." As long as people and horses gathered together, they reveled and forgot themselves, regardless of whether this "gathering" was "tears" or "smiles"? At that time, I was also one of them. Watching the children of the east family and the children of the west family all gathered together to eat and drink, I didn't feel hungry, and only reveled, as if I had gone to "heaven."</p>
<p>Secondly, the general women, each of them put on a bitter face, and there was no such cheerful scene of chattering as usual. Some even had two lines of tears that were about to drip but not dripping on the corners of their eyes, and some were indeed crying secretly.</p>
<p>As for the men, they were after all great men. Although there was no laughter, there was also no crying. However, their faces were indeed different from usual. Their mouths were always longer, and their eyebrows were always. The most special sign was that they were very irritable, often scolding women, often beating children, and sometimes beating children until they cried and wouldn't stop, and even wanted the children to die. They also often gathered together in groups of three or five, talking about how to relieve the disaster, but that was all nonsense, and couldn't be put into practice.</p>
<p>Those who were usually rich people, also ate and drank with us at this time, which was even more hateful and pitiful. The food was so inferior, but to fill their stomachs and save their lives, they had to put down their "status," throw away their previous set of "stomachs," and slowly, no, quickly, swallow and choke. Otherwise, their noble lives, at this time, were only "valued" the same as ours.</p>
<p>However, this was the time between May and June when the old grain had run out and the new grain had not yet arrived. I still remember that after July, this scene was cleaned up, because although that was a year of famine, it was still less famine than now.</p>
<p>Recently, I received a letter from my hometown, saying that "eating row meals" has already started in the countryside. This may still be a very long period of time, alas, Amen!</p>

<h3>Homesickness</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Drifting alone on the lonely journey of life for a long time, that loneliness gradually changed from faint to strong, and all the things that have passed through these times are like footprints printed in many places, disappearing as they appear and disappear. Memory has not left a worthy impression to be forgotten forever from time to time. I feel that everything is a bit empty, and people are even more like stepping on a cloud of clouds, infinitely vague. I think to myself, this is probably because I have lived a few more years, and the childlike spirit has been eroded by the bustling world, making a person's thoughts very illusory, and lacking a keen interest in anything, especially a true taste. However, recently, it is strange that the thought of home, which I have not thought of for a long time and almost forgotten, has been brewing in my heart again. And some of the well-known scenery of my hometown can arouse my deep reverie. In the boundless reverie, there is also a kind of unspeakable intimate feeling, which makes me feel a heavy nostalgia for home.</p>
<p>I have been away from home for quite a while. During this time, I completely made myself a wanderer who really had no home, wandering everywhere. Home was thrown behind me as soon as I crossed the door. The people in the family are looking forward to my news every day, and after too long, letters of inquiry fly in constantly. Each letter is permeated with the kind thoughts of my kind mother and a heart of maternal love. But for this, there is often no emotional stirring, and the heart is like a stagnant pool of dead water. At most, it is just a faint smile, and it disappears without a trace. But now, because of the grinding of endless wind and frost, everything outside, in addition to giving various feelings of indifference and alienation of sadness, I have never obtained any spiritual gift in this long sea of people. Now I deeply feel that home has a very intimate taste, and home has stirred up heavy waves from the still dead water-like heart. The past was so indifferent to home that even I can't explain why now, and precisely because the past was so indifferent, it makes the present</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>, but also mixed with some light-smoke-like hatred and unspeakable regret. This regret is really issued by inner guilt. It becomes a crime against family members, especially the kind mother. I regret it a bit, and I shouldn't have left home like that. For a long time, I didn't send back a message, so that my mother's worried heart was always worried, hoping every day, and finally passing away in the midst of disappointment every day. Maybe this long day will reduce the joy of this homeland and show more loneliness!</p>
<p>Thinking of the homeland across countless mountains, and the heart of a mother across countless seas, worrying about her son thousands of miles away, I almost froze, and a burst of sadness in my heart almost dropped tears. Eyes that have not been wetted by tears for a long time are now often wetted by the pull of home from time to time.</p>
<p>Everything at home is warmly engraved on memory.</p>
<p>When I was at home, I accidentally caught a small illness and lay in bed, my mother was busy all day long, taking care of the cold and heat, taking care of the medicine, almost ignoring other things, ran in and sat on the side of the bed, gently stroking my forehead with her hand, and asked gently: Do you feel better? She ran out and came back to ask again in a moment, do you want to eat something. Even if you don't take medicine, just such warm comfort can make the disease better. But at that time, I didn't feel that these rare human maternal truths were precious at all, but instead became temperamental because of my mother's endless nagging. If I get sick outside, what will happen? Isn't it just hiding quietly in the house alone, unable to hear footsteps or gentle voices. All I can hear is the sound of breathing alone in a groan. My mother's warm comfort? It is only warm review in my dreams. Now that I know that I should cherish it, my body is blocked in a different place with countless mountains and seas. Home, when can I go back to enjoy the joy of that paradise, let me throw myself into my mother's arms and quietly listen to the warm and gentle comforting voice, and restore my barren heart of the lost paradise!</p>
<h3>Winter in Nanyang</h3>
<p>— Er</p>
<p>At this time of year, when snowflakes are about to fall, Nanyang is at its hottest. Here in the north, we love to huddle around the stove, preferring to stay indoors to avoid the cold north wind. We cherish the faint sunlight and rush to bask in it. From morning till night, the wind is fierce and the cold heavy, causing people to shrink and shiver. But in the southern lands, those who live near the equator are constantly immersed in sultriness, dreading the scorching sunlight. They bathe in cold water all day long; before dawn, they must get up to douse themselves with cold water to wash away the heat. Wrapped only in a towel, they sweat profusely. During the day, the streets are dominated by the scorching sun, and like in the north, the cold wind drives away pedestrians.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, the sun relentlessly beats down, with little wind and even less rain. The farmland is often baked as hard as wasteland, making it difficult to believe that it will soon flourish like bamboo shoots after a rain!</p>
<p>Winter is a time of stagnation, filled with heat and barrenness. People are so listless, sitting under coconut trees or hiding indoors.</p>
<p>However, even in the perpetual heat, there are changes reminiscent of spring and autumn within a single day. When the sun sets, the sea breeze sweeps inland, bringing a cool evening breeze in the twilight, dispelling the heat completely. At this time, the streets fill with people, flowing like water against the waves, and the scene is alive with the vitality of spring. People are filled with energy and excitement.</p>
<p>They take off their towels, put on soft, thin short shirts and pants, slip on sandals, and step out of their doors, feeling the coolness on their faces. They stroll leisurely, enjoying the breeze, their hair and clothes fluttering in the wind. They feel completely refreshed, as if they have just emerged from a pool, and their spirits are particularly light. Watching the people drifting by, they feel a sense of detachment from the world, which can dispel the endless worries in their hearts. After being cooped up in the store all day, as evening approaches, they involuntarily feel their hearts floating on the evening breeze, gently swaying, making their limbs feel light and ready to fly. Ah, the evening breeze of Nanyang is truly full of rich poetic charm! After enduring more than half a year of stifling life in Nanyang, people mostly rely on this light, intoxicating evening breeze to pass the time. Those suffering from the cold in the icy winter of the north cannot help but yearn for Nanyang, separated by rivers and mountains, where a gentle and refreshing evening breeze is blowing! Moreover, the time in Nanyang is exactly the winter we are experiencing now.</p>
<p>As the night deepens, the cool breeze of Nanyang will become even more intoxicating. When dawn is about to break, the sea breeze gradually disappears, and the eastern heat seems to bring a sense of warm stagnation. However, after a cold shower in the early morning, the sky resembles the early autumn season, pale and somewhat desolate, with a gentle breeze still blowing, carrying a hint of autumn melancholy within its tenderness. Although not as lively, carefree, and intoxicating as the evening breeze, it still has its unique flavor, a light haziness filled with the vitality of spring. When the sun just rises above the horizon, it seems to radiate the full golden light of spring.</p>
<p>Some call Nanyang a land of perpetual spring, which is not an exaggeration. People living in this Nanyang, which feels like spring all year round, are filled with a sense of intoxicated warmth. The local people of Nanyang live such simple and leisurely lives under this intoxicating and gentle atmosphere. Most live in a few thatched huts, with only a few changes of light clothing. The women chew betel leaves with mouths full, displaying a certain romantic charm, resembling a life close to nature. Most people live for the moment, spending whatever they earn, lacking ambition. In this winter, Nanyang is just like spring, and the people of Nanyang live even more simply, leisurely, comfortably, and warmly! However, the people of Nanyang are also too complacent, somewhat like drunkards who love to drink all the time!!!</p>

<p>Opening: "Standard Beauty"</p>
<p>Today's standard is the most fashionable. New terms are everywhere. He is like a crane standing among chickens, leading the way. He can be a model, a leader. Having that title of "standard" is truly glorious. I'll use it to describe a beauty in detail. Her eyes don't entice souls. Her figure is stout, not slender. Her skin and muscles are all dark. Her movements are naturally uncoquettish. Her voice is loud and clear, like a booming bell. She never appears in social gatherings. She discards all rouge and perfume. She doesn't bother to learn dancing. Her academic achievements in both Chinese and Western studies are not high. However, she is frugal, simple, diligent, and hardworking. Her physique is strong and enduring. Her attitude is dignified and sincere. She never says anything frivolous. Her clothes are all made in China, flag robes made of local cloth. She greets her parents every morning and evening, pleasing them. She is a filial daughter, rare in the world. She hates the modern men and women. She has no interest in romance, her ambition is lofty. Her family is wealthy, with ample money. She is arrogant and not at all proud. Seeing the suffering of bankrupt farmers in rural areas, she personally goes to the countryside to spend lavishly. Her heart is always filled with hatred for the Eastern barbarians. She is willing to serve on the frontier, going to the battlefield. Such women are rare today. They fully embody the four characters of "standard beauty." Please don't laugh at my outdated words. It's just that I'm sounding the alarm, not afraid of mockery. I speak earnestly and tirelessly.</p>

<p>The 20th century brings new styles. Higher races are becoming more civilized. The Chinese are also changing their attitudes. Especially fashionable female students. They are united in overturning old morals. They are single-mindedly learning to be modern. The black hair on their heads is permed with tongs. Western-style, with thousands of bends and curves. They study different ways to apply rouge. They don't use face powder, but Western powder. Their faces are entirely red, like Jiang Boyue reincarnated. They wear a robe made of silk and gauze. The most important thing is that it fits well. Their jade arms are exposed, enough to make one's eyes burn. Their plump hips sway, enough to enchant. Bare feet are considered a modern style. They wear high-heeled leather shoes. They are enrolled in school. The important subject is love. The friends they make are all men. They wear Western suits and leather shoes, fashionable. Today, they go to the park in pairs. Tomorrow, they watch movies in pairs. They want to watch foreign movies. Because Chinese movies are not modern. They are deeply in love. They eat several courses of foreign food. They exchange photos. The so-called love work is completed. A matchmaker comes to arrange a marriage. They get married in a restaurant. From then on, they spend a happy honeymoon. Dear, kiss me. They are affectionate in March and April. They have resentment in May and June. They are jealous in July and August. They become enemies in September and October. In another two months, they will talk about divorce. It is truly like striking apart mandarin ducks. The husbands and wives each sweep the snow from their own doors. They marry quickly and divorce quickly. Afterwards, everyone talks about their love experiences.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of Film Development (5)</h3>
<p>— Wenying</p>
<p>(5) The Attitude Towards Star Worship and Publicity Power</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, I cannot describe all the steps in the development of the film industry in detail. Furthermore, since the rise of the "star system," I cannot record the deeds of every star or quasi-star. However, to understand the background of the film industry, we must briefly describe a significant and meaningful key point between 1912 and 1918, and tell you some interesting stories about the stars of that time.</p>
<p>Before we learn about the deeds of the stars of that time, we can first say that the audience's attitude towards the stars is different from now. When Francis X. Bushman was at his peak, the company believed that the fact that he was married and had children should not be announced. Bushman was a married man with five children, but his contract with the company clearly stated that these facts could not be announced under any circumstances. At that time, he worked at Essanay Corporation in Poem Valley, but his family could only reside in the countryside of Maryland. One day, he brought his family to Poem Valley. The company authorities found out and immediately called Bushman in, severely reprimanded him, and told him to immediately send his wife and children back to the countryside of Maryland to prevent the news of his marriage and children from being leaked.</p>
<p>Bushman was now in a dilemma. On the one hand, he could not violate the terms of the contract and the orders of the company authorities, and on the other hand, he could not summon and dismiss his wife at will. As a result, the news inevitably spread. Firstly, Bushman and his wife had a disagreement, and secondly, Bushman fell in love with Beverly Bayne, a female star colleague. As a result, Bushman and his wife had to agree to a divorce. Bushman and the company both knew that it was difficult to hide the news any longer, so they discussed and agreed to announce the news of Bushman's divorce from his wife and Bushman's marriage to Bayne at the same time. As expected, after these two news were announced, Bushman immediately lost his status as a star. Because a star who already had a wife and five children was not very romantic, who would still worship him?</p>
<p>The company, of course, did not want a big star that had been cultivated for many years to disappear overnight. Therefore, they sent an investigator to conduct a field investigation throughout the country. As a result, he returned from his investigations everywhere. He ran to Bushman's dressing room. He went in and held his head in both hands without saying a word. Bushman saw that the situation was not right and asked, "Is it really not going to work?" The investigator said, "Not only is it not going to work, you are simply finished." His star life really ended there. After a few years, he reappeared in the film "Ben-Hur," but his past glory had disappeared, and he could no longer hear the goddess of luck knocking on his door for the second time.</p>
<p>The above is just one example. If we open and review the old movie magazines from the past, we can find out how vague the audience's knowledge of the stars was at that time. At that time, movie stars were individuals with all kinds of admirable virtues. They were all born into noble families and admired Shakespeare. The publicists at that time were omnipotent. They could cover the eyes and ears of the world with one hand, preventing the truth from being leaked, and on the other hand, they could fabricate facts and deceive the fans. For example, Theda Bara's real name was Theodosia Goodman. She was clearly American, but the publicists said that she was born on the banks of the Nile in Africa. In fact, the real deeds of these stars were more beautiful, grand, vivid, and interesting than the publicists fabricated. But they had nothing to do after eating, and they had to create some news to deceive the audience. The audience now is not the same as before. They are used to real things and do not find it strange for a star to get married and have children.</p>

<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Righteous Guest's Strange Knife"</h3>
<p>— Linghe</p>
<p>Menace — Cathay</p>
<p>The translation of the film title has now reached its peak! The four words "Righteous Guest's Strange Knife" sound stiff and don't seem like the title of a great film.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after being exposed to too many detective films, it is indeed difficult to arouse much interest. The same old structure and lack of principles create a murder story, and the so-called tension and stimulation obtained is the success of the detective film. Therefore, I have almost nothing to say about "Righteous Guest's Strange Knife."</p>
<p>However, I can tell the readers that the use of the sound effect of a rainstorm at the beginning of this film, implying that the subsequent plot will proceed in a tense atmosphere, is quite commendable.</p>
<p>After that, it is all the usual techniques used in every detective film, bringing in a few suspected murderers, hiding the real culprit with photography techniques, and finally revealing the truth. People are really familiar with this kind of thing.</p>
<p>In any case, it is enough to explain that this is a vulgar work.</p>
<h3>"Elegy of Life" and "Emperor E and Empress Huang"</h3>
<p>The relationship between folk songs and a nation is profound, which is a fact recognized by everyone. Therefore, the popularity of a folk song is the expression of a nation's national character. Sometimes, just a few dozen words of impassioned lyrics can excite the blood of an entire nation. At the same time, a few dozen words of stubborn and obscene lyrics can also weaken the spirit of the entire nation. Therefore, the impact of folk songs on society and the country can be said to be profound and significant. At the same time, film is a powerful tool for promoting national culture. Therefore, inserting one or two songs that fit the plot into the film not only forms an additional layer of power for the film itself, but also has a deeper impression on the development of the entire story in people's minds. The Yihua Company's blockbuster, "Elegy of Life," directed by Hu Rui, describes serious problems in current society, such as the painful situation of unemployed youth. The development of the story grasps the contrast between the rich and poor classes. Therefore, in order to strengthen the atmosphere of the play, two songs were specially inserted, namely "Elegy of Life," sung by Liming Hui, which represents the lament of the common people, and "Emperor E and Empress Huang," sung by Hu Ping, which represents the praise of the decadent life of a special class. Not only are the songs melodious and moving, but the lyrics are also heart-wrenching.</p>
<h3>Ye Juanjuan is Trampled</h3>
<p>Under the trampling hooves of ambitious people, a group of innocent northeastern people who have lost their homes flee to the interior. Yuan Meiyun and Ye Juanjuan are two beautiful flowers among these disaster victims. However, in extreme panic and a riotous crowd, Ye Juanjuan lost her lover, Wang Yin, and was tricked to Tianjin by Zhao Xue, a local thug, and offered to his master Yuan Mei as the supreme gift.</p>
<p>When the night lights are first lit, we can see the grand banquet at Yuan's mansion on the road. The lights are bright, and the high-ranking guests are seated. Laughter and shouting echo each other, which is very lively. But who knows that in a room of this grand and majestic Yuan Mansion, there is a pitiful girl like a lamb to be slaughtered, and Ye Juanjuan's pure virginity will be lost under Yuan Mei's trampling!</p>
<p>This is a scene in "Escape," directed by Yue Feng of Yihua Company. Because of the grandeur of the scenery and the large number of shots, it took more than a dozen hours to complete.</p>
<h3>Film Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Occasionally, in a small room, I talked with five or six friends about the famous films released in Shanghai in 1934. Someone suggested selecting ten of them. Therefore, from the twenty film titles that were temporarily thought of, ten were selected. Here, I might as well transcribe them: 1. Fugitive, 2. Long Live Freedom, 3. Puppet, 4. Mutual Aid, 5. Pen Battle Strong Power, 6. Art Sea Spring Light, 7. Count of Monte Cristo, 8. Merry Widow, 9. Boudoir Complaint, 10. Bo Ai Lane</p>
<p>Those who received three votes included 1. Merry Widow, 2. Returning to Truth, 3. I Love Her, 4. Little Great Man, 5. Orient Express, 6. Sad Red and Green, 7. Wealthy Family.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>There is a rumor that Tianyi Company will move to Hong Kong entirely.</p>

<p>Because the Soviets have "refugees," so Wuxi is filming "Wild Child," Nanjing is filming "Wandering Child," Suzhou, Children's Light: Because the United States has "A Fugitive," so... Chinese people have a little cleverness, that is, they know how to imitate.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Anyone who tends to get in front of the camera is called a "movie star," no wonder Chinese movie stars are so numerous and worthless.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>When the screenwriter and the director disagree, a film will never be a complete success. But now, many actors simply write the script themselves, so there are fewer disputes.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Instead of trying to make the plot tense and powerful, desperately trying to find a way out in the subtitles is a clumsy display of a foolish director.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Someone said, "There are no non-romantic female stars." But the word "romantic" depends on how you interpret it.</p>

<h3>Police Detective's White Lies (7)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Joan looked at Condon in disbelief, her hopes, she now understood, were dashed. She shrugged, put on her hat, and followed Condon to the police car. When John Mitchell heard that his daughter had been arrested on suspicion of shooting Azell, he roared and jumped up in anger. But the evidence was solid, and the landlady testified in court that they had rented the house together. Joan said she rented the house for Mary Mallory, but no one had seen Mary Mallory. No one had even heard of her. Dan Oliver had been missing for a long time. No one saw him go to that house. Moreover, Joan's fingerprints were clearly on the gun. Furthermore, when Condon arrived, Joan was the only one by the deceased's side. If Condon were to testify, based on all circumstances, the suspicion of Joan committing the murder would be further strengthened.</p>
<p>Mitchell ran to Condon, wanting to bribe him, to tell him not to testify in court. But Condon refused. He said, "No way. Even for Joan's sake, I can't do that." Mitchell angrily said, "Alright. I promoted you. If I could promote you, can't I ruin you?" Condon was surprised and said, "What? Promoted me? Are you saying my promotion to captain was due to your influence?" Mitchell said resentfully, "Of course. Didn't you know?" Condon said, "Oh, I see. You ruined Oliver and promoted me. Both methods are dishonorable." After he finished speaking, he angrily walked out. That night, he wrote a resignation letter and submitted it to the superintendent.</p>
<p>After Condon rejected Mitchell's request and submitted his own resignation, he was embarrassed to see Joan for many days. But finally, he couldn't bear it anymore. He went to the jail to see her. Their meeting this time was tense and painful. Condon stammered, "I didn't dare to come for several days because I thought you would hate me and refuse to see me." Joan said calmly, "What are you talking about? Taylor, how could I hate you? This is your duty, I understand very well." Condon paused, then suddenly said to Joan, "Joan, I thought of a way. If you could... marry me, they couldn't call me to testify in court." When Joan heard this, a look of joy immediately appeared in her eyes, but after a while, she slowly shook her head and said, "Since others cannot make you change your principles, I will not make you change your principles either." As she spoke, she placed her hands on Condon's shoulders and said, "Taylor, you know I would never lie to you. I did not kill Azell. I swear I didn't. You must believe me. Now our only way out is to find Mary Mallory or Oliver, and everything will come to light." Condon jumped up and said, "My dear, I'll go find them. Don't worry. I will definitely find them." As he spoke, he hugged Joan, kissed her sweet lips, and left. All the witnesses had been questioned, except for Taylor Condon, whose whereabouts were unknown. But at this time, Condon, like a hunting dog, was searching in all directions for Mary Mallory and Dan Oliver. Later, he actually found a clue. Not far from the city, in the mountains, he found a small wooden house where Mary Mallory and Dan Oliver were hiding. Almost effortlessly, Condon caught Oliver and brought him to the local jail. In the local jail, Oliver confessed that he had killed Azell Brantley. He also signed his confession. In this way, the real culprit had been caught, and Joan Mitchell was restored to freedom. On the night Joan Mitchell was acquitted in court, when Mitchell, Taylor Condon, and Joan walked down the steps of the hall hand in hand, a group of reporters, photographers, and newsreel reporters surrounded them. Mitchell muttered to himself, "This is the biggest news of the year." Taylor looked at Mitchell and smiled, "Chairman Mitchell, you are a powerful man in the local area. Can you get us a marriage license right away in this late hour!" (The End)</p>
