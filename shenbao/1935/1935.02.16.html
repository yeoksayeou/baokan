<p>據昨日報載。蔣委員長夫人宋美齡女士鹽於蔣委員長提倡新生活運動。特捐巨欵與本埠聖書公會。俾其翻印聖經。廣爲傳播。以期促進新生活運動之實效。按新生活運動。自蔣委員長倡始以來。已一年於茲。於此一年之中。各方宣傳。雖皆竭誠以赴。然以言成效。不能不謂爲尚有限也。中國國勢凌夷。於今而極。揆厥原因。由於外忠者佔其小半。而由於自身之病根者。實佔其大半。曾國藩有言曰。「無兵不足痛哭。無餉不足深憂。獨求一攘利不先赴義恐後者而不可得。此可爲浩歎耳」此言可謂一語中的矣。蓋「人必自侮而後人侮。國必自伐而後人伐。」不先自有其可衰可亡之道。則雖有敵國外患。亦何所懼。故今日而欲救中國於危亡。亦惟由先生期病根治。蔣委員長提倡新生活運動。特揭「禮義廉恥」四義。爲國人倡。其動機未始不在於此。然一年以來。用力雖多。而成績所以尚未大著者。蓋以過去新生活運動之推行。純從道德方面入手耳。道德爲支配人生之一大勢力。此固無人得而否認之。然道德者。先哲遣我之嘉言懿行耳。至我能否實踐此嘉言懿行。全仗個人之毅力。此其所以爲難也。孔子曾謂「我十有五而志於學。三十而立。……七十而從心所欲不踰矩。」以孔子之至聖。尚必以五十五年之不斷努力。而後始能遠於「從心所欲不踰矩」之境地。則其他衆人之難以有成。要不問可知。蓋道德之戒條。實踐與否。純出個人之自願。茍其不願。則戒條自戒條。生活自生活耳。至於宗敎。則以信仰超自然之人格爲條件。故有信仰。則道德戒條即不難身體力行。所謂如在其上。如在其左右。雖匹夫匹婦。亦可作到。此古人所以有神道設敎之說。今蔣夫人能見及於此。誠可爲新生活運動開一生面也。</p>
<p>耶敎之入中國。雖爲時已久。然往時士大夫尚鮮樂道。實則耶敎之敎義。對於今日茶敝之民俗。可謂對癥下藥。自有深切之需要。蓋耶敎之人生觀。乃一非個人主義而爲利他主義者也。唯其不以個人爲中心。故能勉人爲自我之犧牲。唯其能爲自我之犧牲。故有捨身赴義之精神。使一國之人。多能捨身赴義矣。試問國家有不因是而臻於強盛哉。再則耶敎之人生觀。乃既積極而又消極者也。唯其積極。故爲入世的宗敎。唯其消極。故能勉人以不爲物質之爭。申言之。耶敎之所長。即於助人之事。每勉人以積極之援助。唯於其所得之時。每勸人以退讓。故其爲敎也。既不否定物質生活。同時又肯定精神生活。唯其如是。故與逃世之宗敎。顯有差別。我國今日最大之患。即在個人主義與唯物主義之人生觀。此二者皆使人趨於自私自利之途而不可復。民族之所以成爲一盤散沙。國勞之所以日趨危亟。即此二種人生觀從中作崇。而徒言道德之不足挽救狂瀾。又爲顯而易見之事實。故喚起人民宗敎信仰。藉以檢束身心。是亦矯正習俗之一道耳。</p>

<p>牒覆英法政府措詞友好　對中東歐公約採取保留</p>
<p>［日內瓦］世界和平今日復得兩大勝利、德國已宣布完全接受英法防空計畫之條件、國聯亦採取美國所提計畫、作爲將來軍縮討論之基礎、羅馬柏林且皆有消息、謂德國之空約覆文、對於意法恊定不干涉奧國一點、亦表同情、其間祇有一事、似嫌美中不足、即德國以爲奧國之政府制度、或爲國社主義或恢復帝制、應聽其自擇、至於東方羅迦洛公約、德國表示如其原則係根據於軍事上之互助、則德國反對、惟各國政府當局早已說明、此項條約並非軍事聯盟、而爲互不侵犯云、按德國政府接受英法空防恊定、已在一般人預料之中、據稱德國外長牛賴特送交英法政府之覆文、且曾聲明德國亦願討論一般的軍縮問題、半官消息謂覆文語氣非常友好、而對於取消凡爾賽和約軍事條欵一點、尤爲滿意、至於國聯方而則軍火委員會在此開會、已通過美國代表威爾遜所提重開軍縮會議之計畫、威氏事前亦曾表示美國對於英法恊定甚爲贊成云、（十四日國民電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］關於德國復文之內容、至今晚爲止、此間所知殊屬寥寥、德國外長牛賴特以復文遞交英法兩國大使時、曾附以口頭說明、所述何事亦難知悉、據最初所得消息、復文內容語氣極爲沖和、但故意作晤泛之詞、申明德國具有良善意志、願與各國合作以實現和平、英法宣言書中建議各端、德國最注意者即係天空公約、對於該公約之朱則及基礎、德國均表示接受、至於多瑙河公約及東歐互助公約計畫、則復文中似並未提及、按照英法宣言書規定、該兩公約務當同時實現、方可承認德國軍備平等權利、並訂立一般限制軍備公約、以代替凡爾賽和約之軍事條欵、關於此節、德國復文似甚含混云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］關於德國復文之詳細內容、頃復探悉下列各端、可資補充、德國對於英法兩國建議並未提出問題、惟申明天空公約之主張、係假定德國軍備處平等地位、此固德國所不斷要求者、今英法兩國提議訂結此項公約、則不啻默認此項平等權利云、對於多瑙河公約草案、國政府大抵以爲無再度詳細說明見地之必要、故在復文中僅予概括述及、對於東歐互助公約計劃、則其態度尚不若官方報紙所表示之消極、殊爲一般人所不及預料、惟德國政府以爲安全問題、足以引起多種問題、故採取保留態度、以避免自受拘束、然並不拒絕與各關係國政府會同研究云、（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>［日內瓦］據悉德國之空防恊定覆文、其中曾表示願以德國空軍交託空防條約之簽字國家、作爲任何聯合行動之用、可靠方面解釋、謂德國有此表示、係因倫敦恊定曾假定德國已有此項空軍、然不能視爲德國承認業已超過凡爾賽和約所定之範圍云、（十四日國民電）</p>

<p>綁架情形</p>
<p>首由捕房律師張天蔭起而詳述經過情形、謂被害人王伯瀛、家住麥根路一九五弄歸仁里三號、爲大東書局之董事、其妾李氏、則寓居同孚路一○二弄長豐里十九號、本月九日晚七時許、王至妾處晚膳後、於十時餘、以電話通知大婦處、囑將汽車開來、該車號碼爲五三二一號、迨至十一時、王儲妾李氏同登該車、欲至白克路張姓友人處、諜車出弄口、即有一匪（既死者）站立車前、幾遭輾死、王當時尚斥責車夫不可大意、</p>
<p>贖價廿萬</p>
<p>不料一剎那間該匪與另一匪（即王留根）從左右登車、各出手槍恐嚇、當將李氏逐下、另有一女匪（即王蔡氏）亦上車、死者與氏分坐於王之左右、王匪監視車夫、自行司機、向前疾駛、至辣斐德路邁爾西愛路、即將帶車夫驅下、向西開行、不知所終、後由王家屬投報捕房、後於十一號接到匪黨來信、該信內尚附有肉票之親筆信一封、請求彼父母設法籌欵、匪信內則贖價二十萬元、惟該信係匪方詢得肉票有住於歸仁里九號之殷芝白、可以代爲作主、故逕函與殷、</p>
<p>雙方談判</p>
<p>迨至十三號、住於歸仁里十號之王谷梅、又接被害人之信、亦請代爲設法、乃持函報告捕房、由王家派代表蕭蟾、會同探目崔誠克·黃福森·向匪方接洽、并約定於昨晨十時、在大方旅館二○一號房間談判、迨至昨午十二時、中西探乃在該房間內拘獲王留根·王蔡氏·二人、在氏身畔抄出手槍一支、子彈九粒、查該號房間即係王蔡氏所開、當時化名何秀英、後至大中旅館三○六號房間、續獲楊孔氏及三歲男孩、據楊孔氏當時聲明、彼係受王僱傭爲奶媽、該孩即屬王之子等語、</p>
<p>一塲格門</p>
<p>後由王夫婦供出肉票藏在西愛咸斯路榮福里第八弄十四號內、捕房乃汽同王留根前往匪窟、由王在後門喊門、室內之匪聞聲啓戶（即死者、）詎該匪一見探員、知已事敗、遂即開槍拒捕、向就近西探蓋自來射擊、幸未命中、後面之另一西探白郎林及華探黃福森、亦即拔槍還擊、該匪名姚懋卿、被中二彈、倒斃於灶披內、在其附近地上拾得手槍一支、內有子彈六粒、該屍現送同仁輔元堂候騐、）</p>
<p>肉票中彈</p>
<p>惟當雙方格門時、肉票在樓上亭子間聞警、即從樓窗扒出、但捕房葉探徐德仲不識其爲肉票、誤疑同黨、乃向開六槍、不幸右臂命中一槍、現送入醫院、幸傷勢尚輕、據醫生云、治療十天、當能痊愈、探員乃入室搜檢、在前樓床內、秒出盒子砲一桿、子彈九粒、床下又搜得子彈二百餘顆、黑眼鏡兩副、信封一只、查該信封上之字跡與王之家屬收到者、完全相同、即係死者所寫、遂將各匪一併帶回捕房、</p>
<p>討論綁票</p>
<p>由王供此案係張正國起意、乃於昨日下午六時零五分、在亞爾倍路福煦路信通汽車公司門首、將張逮捕、今被害人王伯瀛因傷未到、其代表蟾及車夫賜福堂等均到請訊、遂由劉推事向各被告隔別訊問、先向王留根詰據供稱、前開大康汽車行、故能司機、去年十二月問、我因欠欵、故在大成公寓張正國商與議辦法、張乃談起王伯瀛前因屢向大康雇車、故彼相識、且深知王家頗富有、大有被綁資格、何妨一試、</p>
<p>下手情形</p>
<p>遂於翌日另闢大方飯店、繼續商議、當時除我及張外、尚有死者姚懋卿大塲、乃決定綁架、惟因缺乏軍械、由姚自願設法、因姚前軍隊辦事、設法較易、遂散、嗣經姚攜來盒子砲一支、手槍兩支（即抄案者）、並定於二月九日實施動手、一面由張與我租就匪窟、預備藏票、除付訂租九十元外、每月房金二十五元、迨至九號、由我及妻蔡氏與姚同去、張因與肉票相識、故未往、先在路隅守候、至十一時、肉票出來、我等即上前、由姚將其妾拖下、我執槍監視車夫、</p>
<p>駛至匪窟</p>
<p>嗣因雙手須司機、不能執槍、乃轉交與姚、故姚其時兩手執槍、與我妻分坐肉票左右、姚左妻右、由我開車、直駛至榮福里、當晚張曾來一次、詢得人已架來即去、由我與姚分任看守、翌日姚即寄信致王之家屬、勒贖二十萬元、該項贖價、事前在方商議、楊孔氏係女傭、因其同居不便、故另庽大中旅館云云、</p>
<p>挾嫌誣攀</p>
<p>繼據張正國供、大康車行爲我父所開、王留根之兄係車行之股東、乃介紹王至行中、先爲開車、後幫助理賬、至去年五月二十二號、王留根忽僞造圖章、向上海銀行冒領洋五千四百七十四元、偕蔡氏逃逸、由我於翌日報告戈登路捕房、並登報懸賞通緝、遂由其代理吳麟坤律師呈出報紙及捕房通緝、遂由其代理吳麟坤律師呈出報紙及捕房通緝書張、即續稱我除爲大康小開外、並任信通汽車公司跑街、係屬正當商人、何能作此綁票之事、且王留根我正在通緝、鳥能與其會面、互商綁架情事、實被挾嫌誣攀云云、</p>
<p>屢往守候</p>
<p>王蔡氏供、與王留根係姘頭、因王私挪行欵五千餘元、無法彌補、偕我同赴無錫避風、貼鄰即屬姚懋卿所居、因此相識、此次來滬、即庽大成公寓、去年廢歷十二月間、我聞王言、現已與張正國商妥、欲作一綁票之事、遂租就榮福里十四號房屋一所、租金由王拿出、手槍則係姚攜來、王·姚·二人、事前曾屢至同孚路守候、</p>
<p>押候再訉</p>
<p>是日我由姚囑同去、謂你不要拍、肉票並無手槍、故同去、且當時本係察窺性質、不料即於是日動手、由姚站立車前、繼將肉票之妾拖下、與我分坐左右、我並未執槍、我夫任司機、將肉票架至榮福里、姚任看守之職、我曾去過數次、並權充看票一次等語、楊孔氏供、爲奶媽、不知綁票之事、末由王留根聲明張確屬同謀、並非挾嫌誣攀、經劉毓桂推事核供、諌各被告準予覊押七蝅再訊、</p>
<p>檢驗死匪</p>
<p>又據法租界訪事報告云、住居公共租界同孚路長豐里十七號門牌紹興人王伯寅、於本月九日午夜、被綁票匪擄架藏匿於法租界西愛咸斯　路許家弄榮福里十四號內、勒索巨欵放贖、至前口午刻由成都路捕房在電話偵知綁匪在鄭家木橋街大方飯店二百零一號房問內接洽贖票、遂派中西探會同法捕房馳往拘獲兩男一女（內一男係事主代表）、又往對門大中飯店拘獲男女匪各一、訊知藏票地點、立即趕往緝捕救出肉票、當時有看票匪無錫人姚慕清（年二十五歲）開槍拒捕、被探籌當塲獻斃各情、已誌昨報、昨日上午、由法捕房報請特二法院首席檢察官陳備三·備法醫姜擔·書記官彭㻞、於午刻蒞騐屍所、檢騐已死看票匪屍體、胸前項下中一槍、洞穿後背右脇與左膝畫上、各中一槍、彈未穿出、右手背一槍、由虎口穿出、食指大姆指均已擊斷、經法醫在左脇·左膝·小腿·上起出六寸槍彈各一粒、騐畢、升坐公案、據法捕房包探張春勝報告案情、後據成都路捕房西探長包朗里格（譯音）投案證稱、我等先在大方飯店拘獲綁匪後、訊知藏票機關、即赴該機關援救肉票、行抵機關後門、由一探叩門、死者開門、一西探沖進去、死者即先開放手槍二三響、我遂開槍對彼還擊二響、死者應彈倒地、又由另一句探開二槍即氣絕、奪下其和中所執手槍、又在樓上床舖抄出盒子砲一支、在大方飯店拘獲之女匪身上、亦有手槍一支等語、並要求將屍身上檢出之槍彈、準予帶回備查、陳首席核詞、即諭騐得姚慕清委係生前槍傷身死、屍屬無從查傳、屍體上檢出珠彈二顆、交由西探長包朗里格帶至捕房備查、騐畢後、由捕房將屍身拍照、即由同仁輔元分黨發給三零六五號板棺收殮、運往浦東埋葬、</p>

<p>金鷄發現新低價</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均呈衰弱之象、因四圍瓊境惡劣、本月份內中有一部分到期貨、無人接受、兼之金融奇緊、日商之空頭安然不補、故枱面上之籌碼、依然充足、惟內地某紗廠繼續扒空、仍難遏止戲風、各月又跌三·五·八角、午後開盤仍疲、新拋又見活躍、各月發現新低峯、但現紗交易有一千包、各月又跌六·七·角至一元一角、查賣出明德二千三百包、賡豐一千六百五十包、顧大八百包、大豐八百五十包、生源九百包、長豐一千八百包、潤康一千二百五十包、買進錦昌一千六百包、均昶一千七百五十包、仁豐八百五十包、泰昌二千四百包、長豐三千九百五十包、昶記一千九百包、瑞大八百包、生源七百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>昨日回麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈平穩之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小八分至一角外、坎拿大小四分、當開價時、各月份交易、均見盤旋、因洋麥雖見微小、惟以現麥到頭不豐、拋貨者寂寞無神、故各月份市氣、略好一二分左右、迨至下午開、本月份初開至八角七分、收價因多頭回出、回落二分、遠期初亦堅、定後因行家拋售、亦微軟弱、此後恐因銀根明鬆暗緊、交易難期踴躍、結果本月份不動、三月份小一分、四月份好一分、現麥市面、仍見平穩、開山東歸德麥三元九角、次八角八分、計開一千包、芝加哥小麥、購買者顯皆欲即刻獲利而了結、冬麥帶復降甘霖、對金案之結果、芝加哥市塲四家經紀行中、看漲者佔二家、</p>

<p>（滬北）昨日河下各幫到船計有二十號、市上各貨去胃日見呆滯、中次高粳價短近尺、中次早晚稻及客元價形略修、其餘之價平定、惟頂洋尖貨缺、銷路雖然微細、其價提高角外、而頂薄到貨不湧、價形挺緊、</p>

<p>楊傑發現西山羊房花崗巖變質作用</p>
<p>全體靜默三分鐘追悼已故步達生等四人</p>
<p>（北平特訊）中國地質學會第十一屆年會經多日之籌備、始於今日（十四日）上午十時、在地質調查所圖書館舉行、出席理事除丁文江因今晨魏善莊貨車出軌、被阻於途中、未能趕到外、餘均出席、各地會員並到有齊魯大學斯克德、徐家匯天文臺臺長龍相齊、國立編輯館主任王恭慕等共一百餘人、茲分誌各方詳情如次、</p>
<p>開幕盛況</p>
<p>首由主席謝家榮致開幕詞、略謂本會原定在北京大學新落成之地質館舉行、嗣因內部工程猶示竣事、故改在平所圖書館開幕、本會已有十三年之歷史、惟其中有兩屆年會未克舉行、故本屆尚爲第十一次、但本屆年會有一大特點、即贈葛利普氏之獎章也、此項獎章係民國十四年葛氏所創立、得此獎章者僅爲去世之布達生氏等、但今日應授該項獎章之二氏並未出席、名單暫行保存、繼謝氏續稱、徐家匯天文臺臺長龍相齊會員前此隨蔣委員長赴西北考察、曾在飛機攝取極有價值之影片、以及黃河兩岸地層及寗夏地質或以幻燈說明、或以電影映演、希諸君注意云、</p>
<p>各項報告</p>
<p>（一）繼由大會書記孫雲鑄報告一年半以來會友喪失情形、據統計結果、一年半以來、共有步達生等四人故去云、（二）繼由錢聲駿報告會計情形、（三）翁文灝報告編輯、經全體會員宣布通過備案、（四）國立編輯館主任王恭慕起立、對於科學名辭經過、有極詳細之報告、惟茲事體大、各衆志不能成城、故望地質學會予以恊助、共同審查、蓋以此項問題、關係中國科學敎育發展、在學術方面極感重要云、繼翁文灝與司克德二氏相繼發表意見、</p>
<p>追悼會友</p>
<p>旋主席提議、全體會員應爲已故會友靜默一分鐘、以示哀悼、當經全體同意、即起立靜默三分鐘、立時會塲消然嚴肅、至此第十一屆之地質學會年會之事務會宣告閉幕、電影相繼開始、計有黃河流域兩岸廣漢之地層、寗夏省之狀況、演畢已十二時許、即攝影休息、</p>
<p>中國鐵鑛</p>
<p>謝家榮於下午二時宣讀論文中「中國鐵鑛之分類」、其大意如下、此次所提出之中國鐵礦分類法、係參照最新礦床學理、以成因爲主、以含礦層之種類時代及沉積方式爲副共分爲五大類十七式、每式以一地名名、之如山西式宣龍式等是也、按謝氏分類法專家葛利普當塲表示贊成、</p>
<p>發明新礦</p>
<p>王作泉於下午二時四十分宣訊論文「湖南錫砒鑛之研究」、其發明之要點如下、湖南礦床生於石炭紀右灰巖之中、距花崗巖甚近、現將所採集之標本、悉磨製光面、與薄片、置於反光顯微鏡及透光顯微鏡下、分別考察、因而發見主要礦物爲毒砂錫石·黃鐵礦·黃銅礦·鋅礦·黃錫·礦磁·黃鐵礦·斑鋼礦·輝銅礦·斜方硫砒銅礦等、軸硫砒銅礦等詳細覽定各礦物礦石沉積之次序原生次生之關係、推定圓簡狀礦床之生成、似由沉積較早之曠物先構成圓形外輪、繼由沉積較晚之礦物、充填輪內、</p>
<p>發現礦床</p>
<p>朱煕人於下午三時半宣讀論文「四川西部銅鑛床之成因」、其新的發現如下、（一）玄武巖中之銅礦、在川西分佈較廣、其成因皆屬噴出後期影響作用、其時溫度當在攝氏二百五十度以下、其硫鍋礦之來源、當由玄武巖本體中疑聚而成、（二）水成銅礦、在三疉紀層之最下部含煤負巖中、負巖直接位於二疉紀玄武巖之上、此類銅礦之成因爲三疉紀時這海口或海淀之經岸、其邊岸爲二疉玄武巖所造成、玄武巖之銅礦、經風化作用、成爲硫酸銅液、</p>
<p>花崗變質</p>
<p>楊傑於下午四時宣訊論文「北平西山羊房花崗巖週圍變質作用」、其新的發現如下、北平西山之羊房、大覺寺、溫泉諸處之間、有一大花崗巖露頭、此巖約爲新生代初期造山運動時上升所礙固、因其年代較新之故、所以其與周圍連接之各種地層之年代、亦非常複雜、在北部、羊房之西、此花崗巖與火山巖層接觸、在鷲峯大覺寺某處、在花崗巖與火山巖之間、還有一層頁狀巖、在南安河溫泉等處、花崗巖與變質石灰巖接觸、此石灰巖之上、有一厚層頁巖、即在鷲峯大覺寺等處所常見者、城子山石景山脈完全爲此巖所成、在此厚頁巖之上爲煤系次爲厚層砂頁巖、再其次爲層浸入巖、最上爲頁巖沙巖礫等、這些諸地層受花崗巖漿之故、均起變質現象、由此變質、故重生各種變質鑛物、此處地層構造亦頗有趣、北部花崗直充上火山巖層、西部充至火上巖下部頁巖層、南部僅至古生代下部石灰巖、故此最啊石灰巖當爲寒武紀及臭陶紀、其上之頁巖當爲九龍山系大覺寺鷲峯間之頁巖當屬同時、又在城山之南、由斷層之故、楳系（當爲楊家屯系）超覆九龍之上因在此煤之最上部、有九龍山系之故、此外在溫泉之東、黑龍潭等處煤系與木灰巖直接接觸可以證明自城子山之南至黑龍潭爲一斷層、在此斷層當多出泉水、但在金山大覺寺此條綫上、泉水當爲另一始源、不可混論、此處因上部爲火山巖層、收浸入向下流、流至下部花崗巖上面、即流出故也、</p>
<p>正長石英</p>
<p>陳國遠於下午五時四十五分宣讀論文「山東榮成縣城東馬鞍山石英正長巖」大意如下、榮成縣地質、至今可謂均示研究好、今僅將其東南部馬鞍山地質、簡單研究、此山有兩峯、形如馬鞍故名、其西部之下層爲一最有趣之正長巖、此巖大部爲正長石所成、在此鑛物之間、有許多石英、角閃石微晶、在此正長巖之上爲安上粗面巖、再上爲流紋、因此可推測此種巖石年代爲最新、或可與山西臨縣等處鹼性正長若相似、陳氏將論文讀畢、時已六時四十分、主席宣佈散會、明日（十五日）繼續開會、上午公開講演、下午宣讀論文云、（瑾十四日）</p>

<p>— 唐壽民</p>
<p>交通銀行總經理唐壽民氏、對於特種試用員之訓話如下、</p>
<p>諸君到行以來、已經有三四個月了、一向因爲事務較忙、故無暇和諸君見面、今天抽暇和諸拉談話、一則和大家認識認識、二則對諸位的種種希望、亦乘此機會發表一下、現在先把本行歷史、來說一說、</p>
<p>交行係於前清光緒三十三年、經郵傳部奏準設立、官商合辦、規定於銀行普通業務外、所有郵政·航政·電政·路政·四大政欵項、均歸本行經理、所以定名曰「交通」、那時本行業務性質、實有專門錫行的使命、此可稱本行業務性質、實有專門銀行的使命、此可稱本行歷史「第一時期、」迨至民國三年、大總統公佈交通銀行則例、規定本行除普通業務外、準許掌管特別會計之國庫金、並有經理國庫公債及行發兌換券之權、民國十一年、設立分區發行總分康、專管發行準備公開獨立、後來經過種種變化、更替極多、時期亦極長、此可稱本行歷史之「第地理期、」民國十七年、原則變更、國民政府公佈條件、以本行爲發展全國實業銀行、定營業年限爲三十年、於是本行重新規定承辦各項業務、總行亦於是時移在上海、遍時（民國十八年）我任滬行經理、銳意經營、以圖發展、此可稱本行歷史之「第三時期」、</p>
<p>現在本人又來服務交行、總攬行務、本希望「就題內做文章」、無奈世界經濟不影氣、國內農村破產、兼以天災人禍、相遍而來、情形不同、環境複雜、原有計劃、不一定一時就可做到、我們只能抱定決心、努力做去、總有可以達到目的的一天、關於此事、我們下次再來討論吧、</p>
<p>以前本行用人制度、偏重感情、因爲用引薦制度、有親戚、有朋友、便可以介紹、我不敢說、從前採用引薦制度而進來的同人、多不好、但祇少可以說這種引薦制度、絕對的不適宜於合日之進化社會、再進一步說、我有親戚做官、我就可以做官、此種不良狀態、實爲中國各種事業不進步重大原因之一、凡事業之興盛、全重人才、沒有人才、就沒有事業、就能免強維持事業、這事業總不易發展、我常覽得社會多賦閒之人、當局有才難之嘆、此種現象、實爲中國社會之時形、有人常此皆引薦制度的不好、我卻深表同情、所以要變更此種制度、莫如考試及甄選、各大學保送優良畢業生方法、今日與諸君談話、倍覺欣慰、</p>
<p>我不講人情、不主張保薦、用甄別方法、考試制度、來選取優等人才、此在本行固屬創舉、即在同業各行中、亦屬不甚多見、故對於諸君抱有一種極遠大希望、並感覺有一種極急切的需要因爲近年來銀行事業逐漸趨向專門技術化一般從事銀行事業者、不便要有打算盤的技術、記賬的經騐、同時還要有法律智識、科學方法、應用技術、來提高辦事效率、他如對於橷工業之投資、更需要專門人才、調查研究、所以諸君來此、一方面是本行需要人才的補充、一方面是應專門學識的需要、現在雖是銀行的普通人員、將來都是本行的中堅分子、所以要們要明瞭自已地位的重要、並了解自已前途的遠大、</p>
<p>諸君離開學校生活、進了社會、應時時刻刻記得、第一是讀書、第二是經騐、第三是定做事方針、成就一個健全人才、此種健全人才、非特爲本行人才、若干年後、爲銀行界產生多少經理人才、並希望造就多少總理經人才、這是我培養人才、和愛惜人才的根本主張、</p>
<p>在做事方面來說、從前有人主張好的下來、不好的退回各校、此種政策、在用人方而是應該如是、但現在我看了你們各部處見習報告、多很不差、有的極好、我可以說、全可留下來、并且公事已經發表、看你們的辦事成績如何、再行考核、成績優良者、可以隨時遞升、辦事不力者、當還有甄別的日子、諸位應當特別注意、</p>
<p>其次、本人在此、與諸君共同辦事、大家應當本各個人之精力、爲行中服務、彼此情形、應大家明瞭、我現在介紹本人的經歷來告訴各位、我既不是大學畢業、亦不是中學畢業、我是錢莊出身、完全從經騐上得到今天這個地位、我會計·營業·出納·文書·都辦過、小行大行經理亦當過、我的環境、是毅力·苦幹·奮門·忍耐等等、自前清以至民國、已近三十年之歷史、即前清不算、亦已有二十三年金融界的關係、所以要有相當的成功、應有相當的努力與時間、諸君方出校門、不必過求急進、現在已經分別派定職務、計在稽核處十一人、業務部四人、業務研究室六人、儲信部一人、正是服務銀行的開始、但是諸君的前程如何、不寧看諸滬的努力如何、現在把我所希望各點、告訴諸位、請大家注意、</p>
<p>（一）忍耐心　我們服務社會、最要的是要忍苦耐勞、遇有不如意事、更當忍耐、一時雖然委屈、後來總有人看見的、對行務有不滿意時、不必客氣、用合法手續、陳述意見、現在要打破惡習慣、不必有階級觀念、如面談時間不夠、或無暇面談、可用通訊方法來說明、你們有意見、我極願接受、並總不使你們受什麼委屆、</p>

<p>鐘噹噹的才響過，每一個敎室裹，便吐出幾十個小學生來。——這便是一個小學校裹下課的塲面。</p>
<p>於是廣大的一塊空地上，便滿佈了中國的未來主人翁。雖然也有幾個是玩著大皮球，小皮球，但是一大半的東奔西馳的，是忙著使足了勁兒的追逐著打架，嘴裹一疊連聲的侮辱著被追者的十七八世的祖宗。</p>
<p>一簇一簇的，是在玩著從爸爸領著上戲院上裹瞧來的「三本鐵公鷄」，或是從門板書攤上租來的小說中所得到的「雲來霧去玩法賓」的把戲。另外的一簇一簇的，是在地上打彈了，滾銅板，沒命的想把別人口袋裹的錢，引到自已口袋裹。</p>
<p>這些玩藝兒，是沒有女孩子們的份兒的。裹在小旗袍裹，或是長衣短裙裹的女孩子們的課餘工作，總是保護著弟弟和妹妹，或是和同學的女孩兒們談論著頭鬆該怎麼剪，圍巾該做甚麼顏色的，或是某先生的長衫如何，某先生的說話怎樣。但是女孩子受男孩子的欺負，在小學校裹，也正像普通社會裹的女人，一樣的容易受男子的欺侮。女孩子好好地站著，給男孩子揑一把，撈一下，或打一記，是頹鬆平淡的一回事。</p>
<p>在校門口，是擠滿了小販。「五香花生米」，「香港牛肉」，「陳皮梅」，「豬油百果麻酥糖」等等，應有盡有。還有「一個銅板打頭彩」，「三十六門，門門有彩」。還有「三個銅板一支鉛筆，二毛錢一枝自來墨水筆」。還有，還有說不盡的形形式式，每一個攤上，都擠滿著小學生。</p>
<p>鐘又噹噹的響了，小學生們都擁進課堂去、擁進課堂去受做中國未來主人翁的敎育去了。</p>

<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>蘇州是那樣迷人的。它宛似一個美人，陶醉在粉紅色的夢裹，時而嬌笑，時而微顰，足使人見之，情長氣短的。</p>
<p>電臺播音，一天到晚，鬧個不絕。倘使你走過一條觀前大街，包你耳朶裹可以聽到各式各樣，聞所示聞的調兒。不，即使你走過四街小巷，也可以看見高高的天綫，縱橫交錯著。這，可以證明無綫電收音機，已成爲蘇州家家戶戶的恩物了。</p>
<p>自有了無綫電，蘇州平添了許多游藝家，紅極一時。今天桃花塢錢公館點「哭七七」：明天濂溪坊李點「怕老婆」，大儒巷黃點「小孤孀」：後天臨頓路某商店點「滑稽道塲」，古市巷趙點「滑稽道塲」，古市巷趙點「活捉張三郎」。他們—游藝家—真是忙不過來。據他們報告，承蒙各界紛函點唱，非常榮幸。但一日之間，有的點「哭七七」，有的是點「怕老婆」，有的是點……真是公要餛飩婆要麵，使他們著實爲難。因爲時間有限，而他們又只生了一張嘴；於是「晚生」，「抱歉」等字眼，遂成爲他們播唱前的開塲白。</p>
<p>就以耳而說，蘇州已夠迷人。再以目來說，日裹不必談，一到晚上，你如踱過一條觀前大街，包你目不暇給。巍巍的銀行建築，紅紅緣緣的年紅燈，較之上海霞飛路，雖不免如小巫之見大巫，然而也足夠迷人了。</p>

<p>— 北平客</p>
<p>雖然在八九年前新世界也曾有滑冰遊戲部，可是這些滑冰也不過在地板上穿了有輪子的冰鞋溜溜，和咱們北平的溜冰可大大不同；</p>
<p>北平的冰塲可分二種；一是天然的，這就是那些湖或小的浜，到了國歷十二月初，便結了厚厚的冰，成了天然冰塲。另一種是人工的，這就是因北方天氣太寒冷了，所以在天井內隔夜澆了許多的水，明天便會成了人工冰塲，北平最出名的天然冰塲要推燕京大的，及南海，北海三處，人工的要推恊和醫院及清華大學的冰塲。</p>
<p>溜冰的鞋並不像在上海我們所見那種四輪的冰鞋；它就是一雙長統的用駝絨做裹的長統皮鞋，下面釘了一條和鞋一盤長閣約二寸薄薄的刀，所以初學的人，空了這類冰鞋不要說溜了，就是要身體很平衡地立在冰上也不是易事！</p>
<p>溜冰的玩意可就多了，除了甚麼冰上賽跑，冰球戲，用冰鞋寫花樣，最好看的要算那冰上的單人舞及雙人舞了。這在冰上翩翩的舞姿真要較甚麼跳舞廳光滑地板上的舞侶上，要好看得多咧！</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>美國麥賽丘會支州內的臺克諾羅治研究所衛生學敎授，最近發表美女的判斷方法，就是把身體各部份計算其點數，能夠滿百點的，才可算完全的美人，他的採點方法，非常精密。即（一）依年齡及身長的體重定爲二十點。（二）頭髪沒有加油時有光輝的色澤定爲五點。（三）眼睛難然陰鬰清潔，其眼白帶黃色者，仍爲下品，須雙眼透明光輝才爲五點。（四）口形到處有幸福表現者爲五點，但呼吸時垂下的，仍爲下品，（五）牙齒在咀嚼時很密縫者爲五點。（六）皮膚明朗光滑，肌理細緻，頰與唇具有自然色者爲十點。（七）指爪清潔，光滑美麗，進出長短，很完善者爲五點。（八）足形具有自然的美，由足踵到大足指頭的綫，直而不歪者爲十點。（九）姿勢上，兩肩左右平衡，雙腕緩舒，腹部綫美，兩足平行稍離幾分者爲五點。坐時的綫形優美者二點。步履時能調和運動者爲二點。離開十六呎，能聽到普通談話，有健全聽覺者爲五點。兩腕直伸具有讀書的視力者爲五點。（十）健康上，心身爽快有自制力熱情等者爲十點。（十一）衣服能適合個性的與時地的中心者爲五點。照此採點判斷法，各大中小學的女學生中，差不多不適合上列十一點，得列九十六點者不過一人。這是就麥賽州的各方評判而說的，可知能完全適合上列條件的，實在好似鳳毛麟角啊。</p>
<p>聖林的美容專門家華里威司嗎亞氏等，最近從調和均勢美貌三點評定婦女美貌的標準型，其中有一位西羅維亞細陀尼女士，得全體專門美容家的贊美，認爲唯一無二的美人。細陀尼女士爲南加利福尼亞人，由南加利福尼亞美容家恊會，選爲「美貌的標準」，這女士的面貌，照幾何學的構成，差不多沒有一些毛病。就是（一）顏的長爲鼻的三倍。（二）眼興眼的中間，空有一眼的地位。（三）上不兩啓的幅，一些不差。（四）左右調和的肩毛延長綫，在鼻雅集中於一點。（五）下臉與上臉的問隙，與上臉與眉的間隙相等，（六）眼最近於鼻，由眼的上方中間分開，絲毫不差。（七）頰的幅，恰比鼻的大一倍。這標準型的美貌，發表於世後，南加利福尼亞婦女們，都到美容院去鑑定，然而總沒有像細陀尼女士這樣的齊整的。</p>

<p>我上面不是已經說過，每當太后有什麼不快的感覺時，合宮的人便都連帶的會發愁起來了；所以我們總是要盡力的設法使伊快活，尤其是在這些氣象陰森的盛京古宮中，我們倘若再不在精神上找些適當的調劑，真要變爲生趣索然了！因此，當我想到今天是月半，照尩應該唱戲的時候，我心上真覺得高興極了</p>
<p>「老佛爺」！這一天的早上，我雖然瞧伊的臉色尚不十分溫和，但爲著要揭去這一重濃厚的愁務起見，我竟極大膽地向伊說道：「今天又是月半了！我們不是應該唱一次戲嗎？依奴才的意思，如其讓這裹的老祖宗們也見見我們那些熱鬧的玩意兒，使他們知道如今的天下，還是跟先前一般的昇平安樂，可不是一種很好的孝敬嗎？再者，我們在這里既不再有什麼好去處可以出去玩，那末光是枯坐，也太氣悶啦！唱戲倒是最好的消遣。」</p>
<p>太后聽了我的話，居然露出了一絲笑意，並把頭微微點了一點。</p>
<p>「不錯！你這個主意確是好的！就依你吧」！伊便絕不遲疑的核準了我的建議。</p>
<p>「那末，請老佛斧吩咐，今天該唱那幾齣戲呢」？我的冒險的嘗試既已成功，膽子便外大了，爽快催伊點起戲來。</p>
<p>「我沒有什麼成見，就把你所愛聽的戲點一兩齣出來吧」！伊的笑意漸漸地透露了。（二四五）</p>

<p>收音機的所在地，如果時常移動，並須將天綫的長度，高度和方向，以及地點註明纔行。</p>
<p>當接收遠地播音時，聲浪時高時低，此種現象，在無綫電學上稱爲衰落。（Ｆading）其原因本刋第七十七期拙作「衰落在收音機內」一文內，已有敘述。牠是隨時隨刻，隨處隨地而異的，所以衰落的狀況，也有記錄的必要。</p>
<p>有無天電或其他騷擾，也須附帶記出。</p>
<p>最難記錄的，便是音訊的好壞，關於這一項的記載，向來是各隨已意，任便填寫的。如此漫無規定，當然不合於科學上的原則。無綫電界爲補救此項缺點起見，便定了下述的兩種標準音訊任號：</p>
<p>（一）音量符號　通常以Ｒ代表之，強弱共分九種：</p>
<p>Ｒ1極弱　　Ｒ6較強</p>
<p>Ｒ2甚弱　　Ｒ7強</p>
<p>Ｒ3弱　　　　　　　　　　Ｒ8甚強</p>
<p>Ｒ4較弱　　Ｒ8極強</p>
<p>Ｒ5尚好</p>
<p>（二）音符號　遠地來之播音，往往不易得到清晰的聲浪，有時雖甚響亮，可是因爲種種騷擾的關係，卻依舊很難辦別。所以又規定了一種質符號，通常以Ｑ代表之。</p>
<p>Ｑ１不能辨別</p>
<p>Ｑ２僅有一二字可以辨別</p>
<p>Ｑ３難於辨別</p>
<p>Ｑ４易於辨別</p>
<p>Ｑ５字字均極清楚</p>
<p>例如音訊符號爲Ｒ8及　即某電臺之音量很響，音質亦極清晰。</p>
<p>此外，如電臺之地點，呼號，以及週率或波長等等，均爲常人所深知者，已詳註附表內，本文不再贅釋。</p>
<h3 id="c211">從收音機的校核曲綫說到綫圈自感量的實騐測定法 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 汪盛世</p>
<p>凡是備了一具收音機的，都應當自已畫一條校核曲綫。這曲綫用處很大，不但能告訴你各電臺的位置，同時還能幫助你去找尋遠地的電臺。</p>
<p>什麼呌校核典綫呢？我想讀者大都已經知道，不過因爲下面用得到，現在不妨再簡單的說一說。無論那雙收音機，總是有一個配諧電路，由一個綫圈和一隻變量電容器組成。這電容器的刻度盤上通常分爲一百格。這電容器的刻度盤上通常分爲一百格，轉動這電容器時，就可以收到不同週率的電臺。</p>
<p>現在拿一張方格紙，橫方取一百小格作爲刻度盤的度數，縱方代表電臺的啟羅週率，可自五○○寫至一五○○（如圖二）。然後注意收聽電臺，例如聽到中央電臺在九○度，即在橫方九○處盡一點，記下中央二字。又中央爲六六○千週，由此點上去，在六六○的地方作一點。用同樣的方法把其他的電臺一一記下，上海的電臺時常在報告呼號，所以這步工作不久即可做完。於是把許多點用曲綫板連接起來，就得到一條曲綫或直綫，須視電容器的種類而定。我用的是亞美三一二一號，所以畫出的曲綫如圖。他的最大用處有二：</p>
<p>（一）已知週率的電臺可由曲綫求其位置。例如福州電臺夾在東方與中西二臺之間，平常簡直聽不到（在崑山用再生式直流三管機收聽），但因其爲一○三○千週，由曲綫知其必在二九度。那天一二八的晚上，東方與中西均停播，將刻度船轉至二十九度，固然在揚聲器中聽到很清晰的報告。</p>
<p>（二）任何聽到的電臺可由曲綫求其週率。我的收音機共聽到八個日本電臺，均未聽其呼號，但由曲綫一查，即可知其臺名，例如中央旁八十七度有一日本電臺，由曲綫知其必爲六七○千週率，就是臺北電臺。</p>
<p>這曲綫還有一個用處，就是可以用來求綫圈Ｌ的自咸量。我們知道電臺的度數和Ｌ的自感與Ｃ的電容量有密切的關係，以公式表示，即</p>
<p>其中爲電臺的週率，Ｌ爲自感量（亨利），Ｃ爲電容量（法拉特）</p>
<p>普通電容器Ｃ的最大電容量都是已知。如亞美三一二一爲·○○○三兆分法拉特。這個值就是刻度盤轉到一百度時的電容量。這地方相當於多少週率呢？若是一○○度上恰有電臺，當然最好。假使沒有，可把曲綫順著延長到一○○度，再看這點的週率爲何值。因爲在週率低的地方，這曲綫已經很近直綫，所以延長決無困難。就我的收音機言，刻度盤轉到一○○度上週率爲六三○千週率，即爲Ｆ。將Ｆ及Ｃ的值代入公式，即得</p>
<p>求得Ｌ的值爲。○○○二一亨利，即爲綫圈Ｌ的自感量。</p>
<p>電容器的刻度盤轉到零度時，電容量並非爲零。由校核曲綫知此處之，率爲一五○○千率，再代入公式：</p>
<p>求得Ｃ之值爲·○○○○六兆分滋拉特。所以知道亞美三一二一電容器定動片完全分離時，其電容量爲·○○○○六兆分法拉特。</p>
<p>這方法可適用於任何廣播收音機的配諧電路。但是廠家所製的可變電容器，其容量並不十分凖確，所以求得的結果，也當然有些誤差了。</p>

<p>— 鑑</p>
<p>短波之傳播狀態，每因波長（週率）而異，且有因季節，盡夜時間等之關係，其至全然不能通信者，故在某一季節或某時間，應選擇某種波長（週率）此吾人所應加以注意者也。茲就業餘波長帶（週率帶）中適當選擇，則大體可分下列數種：</p>
<p>（一）7，000KC帶及14，000KC帶爲最廣用者，盡夜遠距離之實騐均均利用之，尤其是14，000KC帶對於盡間遠距離之通信最爲適當。</p>
<p>（二）夜間潰用者爲1,750KC,8500KC,7,000KC及14,000KC此中最普及者當推7,000KC帶。</p>
<p>（三）在夏季盡間之遠距離通信，最適宜者爲28,000KC及14,000KC之週率帶1,750KC週率帶最適用於二百至三百英里之通信，因其發振較易，適宜於初學者之運用。</p>

<p>— 李堅</p>
<p>據蘇聯真理報科學新聞上載：黑海打撈沉攻海底的「鯨船」工程處，經年餘之打撈工作，迭次試用海底無綫電播音，均無良好結果。但繼續研究，始終不怠，卒於去年十二月底從黑海的海底用無綫電播音發出勝利的消息。據打撈沉船負責人報告：他們特製一種防水輕便播音機與收音機，附在防水衣的背面，重量並不十分增加動作則非常工作，而且還能隨時隨地，播音收音，這樣就可以與岸上發生極其密切的各種聯絡。</p>
<p>當第一次採用海底無綫電，舉行下水典禮的時候，馬克新門斯（打撈沉船總指揮）這樣表示：在他歷來打撈沉船工作的生活中，從未見過有如撈「鯨船」這樣繁難困苦的事實。現在我們經長期奮門的結果，發明了此種海底無綫電，利用牠來指揮打撈「鯨船」的一切工作，也就方便多了，現在我們不僅完全確信沉海的「鯨船」可以全部打撈，而且今後我們對於打撈沉船的工作，直可稱霜於全世界之上云云。他在講完的時候，即命打撈手在海底播送歌詞：「我們要征服一一切；已經征服了。我們要戰勝一切；已經戰勝了。前進！前進！科學的勝利終屬我們……」。凡收聽這次播音的聽衆無不高呼「萬歲」！而散。</p>
<p>莫斯科各大無綫電材料製造廠，現正積極趕製海底無綫電需用的呈切特殊材料，並開辦短期速成學校，訓練此等技巧人材，以期擴大和改善將來的一切打撈工作。</p>

<p>— 周文巍</p>
<p>關於這個問題，我所見到的大作，有許多。有的用天然的吸鐵石，著失磁的磁極上，往返的摩擦，使他恢復。有的用電磁石，通著電流，接在失磁的磁極上，使他恢復。二者方法俱佳，均可採用。不過經作者試騐之下，覺得有三點弊端：（一）不易過磁，（二）過磁後磁力不強，（三）過磁後，極易失掉。諒試過的讀者，總感到同樣的情形吧！現在把我在假期內。發現恢復磁力的新方法，（一·不費錢，二，方法簡，三·人人會·四·磁力強，五·不易失），假本刋錄出，以供同好者之參考。</p>
<p>恢復方法——取失磁聽簡的黑綫腳，接在地綫上，（試騐的人，一定要立在凳上，使人體與地氣隔離，可免觸電危險）。另把紅綫腳，向電燈的火綫上一碰，即刻就要離開，（時間過長，要燒斷聽筒內細綫的）。那失磁的聽筒，便已恢復，與新一樣。（在接電燈火綫時，若沒有火星發現，就是接錯，應該對調一下）。這個方法，作者可以擔保，不會失敗的。</p>

<h3 id="c215">知識綫上的矛盾 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 何繩</p>
<p>春季開學日期早已過了十多天·然而上海各報上還擁擠著中小學校的招生廣告，而且是第三次乃至第四次的招生了。這件事告訴我們：上海學校多敎師多而學生缺乏。爲什麼有這現象呢？回答是因爲不景氣！不景氣使得多數人拿不出上學錢。</p>
<p>然而報上又載過，江浙內地有許多小學校欠薪多者八個月·少亦四五月，「神聖清高」的小學敎師餘不過肚子，竟相率罷敎了。浙江某縣本有小學六個，去冬以來，罷罷敎敎，沒有一天是有兩個學校同時在上課。許多小學生只好閒起來。這跟上海的有學校有敎師而缺少學生豈不是相反？然而這也爲的是不景氣！因爲不景氣影響了敎育經費來源的幾項「的欵」。</p>
<p>普遍的不景氣又影響到書店。據說上海各書店十九是現金缺乏。然而就賬目上看，差不多家家有贏餘的。贏餘的是放賬。既然還開著店，新書不能不出；可是新出了書銷不動呢，果然只好高堆在機房裹，銷得動呢，所得也是一筆賬。出書呢不出呢？這又是一個矛盾了。</p>
<p>然而同時訊者界（雖然這只是很小的範圍了）卻在那里大呌沒有什麼書可訊！書店老板何嘗不在那裹尋找一些能有廣大訊者的新書來出版，可是廣大的訊者羣卻時時感到沒有書讀。這一個矛看卻也滑稽得勵害。</p>
<p>去年是雜讀年。那熱鬧的情形是空前的。然而據調查，各雜誌的銷數只有跌，能夠維持原狀不跌就算是頂括括的了。這事實分明指出了雜誌的增多並不和讀者的增多成正比例。然則是因爲作者增多了麼？據說卻又不盡然。雜誌的編輯先生會告訴你：投稿可用者如何的少，而拉稿又如何的費力。這不是又一個矛盾麼？</p>
<p>知識綫上的矛盾從沒像現在那麼多而且勵害的！要是下點工夫去搜集材料，這筆矛盾賬敢說是寫不完。這些矛看倘使不能解決，任何復興中國文化的方案都是只是不兌現的支票罷了。而這些矛盾有一個總的根因，就是社會的不景氣和混亂！</p>
<h3 id="c216">爪哇海關前所見 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>才從海關前的堅牢的板橋跨上班哖岸，便被一大堆的人羣擋住了去路。</p>
<p>馬來青年同小孩子們袖著乎嚴肅地向海關前的曠塲圍觀，中國苦力們和店夥們卻用一種旁觀者的態度，像看演戲般注視著廣塲中戲子的主角，——帝國的男子們。</p>
<p>穿進人業中一看，卻見幾位穿著木展穿著和服的「亞洲的主人翁」正指著海關辦事處而開口痛罵，那態度是異常威武和激昻。</p>
<p>「你，什麼小關主，敢和我們搗蛋麼？」一個罵。那馬來語是一個音一個音都給咬實著，正像帝國的男子們所慣常使用的英語一般。不過因爲憤怒，字音便被咬得更爲堅實了；簡直把虛音都咬成了堅牢的銅鐵。</p>
<p>另一個，卻握著手直逼上海關的門口，罵聲是響澈全班哖岸了：</p>
<p>「你敢，便出來海關前決門一塲吧！我們日本人，是不會把你一個小小的爪哇關員，看在眼里的。」</p>
<p>另一個四五十歲的中年人，態度似乎較爲齌和些，卻挿著手站在廣塲中間，喃喃地說：</p>
<p>「看他們怎樣同我們計算著。看他敢欺負我們！」</p>
<p>阿興站在一雙木箱子上，向旁邊一個馬來人問：</p>
<p>「什麽事」</p>
<p>那一個瘦小的馬來人用著一種陰沈的低音說：（聲音是我異常低微的，像怕被在狂怒中的人們聽見一般。）</p>
<p>「鬼知道。莫不是爲了納稅的事。據說爪哇關主把一位日本人的貨件抽得太高的稅，在海關裹爭吵起來。他們便糾合全埠的五個同僑，留著娘兒僮看店，都到這兒示威來了。」</p>
<p>阿與哈哈大笑起來，說：</p>
<p>「你們「亡國奴」，是活該被木展覽兒踐踏的。」</p>
<p>這話有些剌傷著馬來青年了。那個突然昻奮地說：</p>
<p>「便是你們「支那人」，也不見得不會被日本人欺侮吧？——我們，我們是有新興的土耳其的。」</p>
<p>「不，我們「中華人」，我們是敢和日本人打仗的。」</p>
<p>甲必丹先生聽到這些話便覺得有點厭煩了。他縐著眉頭，催我們速走。一則他身體已經很是疲敝；二則或者他覺得這些爭論是有點不妥吧？</p>
<p>雖然對於這海關前所見的事件未曾見到一個結束，阿興卻因爲憤怒，竟拖著我走了。</p>
<p>在路上，阿與還憤憤地說：</p>
<p>「他媽的，真是鬼攪的世界—去年一隻日本漁船半夜衝入魯河的海關而致撞沉了。給我們華人的漁人代爲打撈起來。待海關事後到來查問，你有他們憄麼說：」</p>
<p>「我們在海上遇風。我們避入這里。你們海關晚上也不點燈，敎我們知道海關究竟藏在那里—現在船撞沉了，你們倒要歲點責任的。」</p>
<p>「他媽的，遇風？如果我們中國人船隻，半夜三更不報關而闖進來，船隻不會被扣留，也要出一筆備欵哩。而他們，據說船隻自已修好後，班聽政府倒貼出一筆撫䘏金啦　！」</p>
<p>「他媽的，想起「支那人」這個侮辱的名詞，真敎人給氣死咯！」</p>
<p>甲必丹先生和我靜靜地走著路，一會兒不說話。經過了一番考慮，甲必丹先生才吐出了像下面的結論：</p>
<p>「都是，我們太沒有團結啦。你看他們，一有小小的事件發生，便所有的五個人都全班出馬了。」</p>
<p>「我們不會團結嗎？爲什麼我們不團結？」阿興反問，一個理智的問題把他的似火般的情感壓了去了。</p>
<p>「我們爲什麼會團結？」我想用Ｋ地來反辯，但是我卻沒有說出來。</p>
<p>我們進人××公司，一種無聊的應酬話便把這些話掩蓋起來。</p>

<p>每一個有正義感的作家，總是毫不容情地把現實的裹皮揭露出來：光明或是黑暗：朋友或是敵人；在這中間，他從不滲進一點粉飾或是遷遷就的。</p>
<p>然而就爲了這緣故，一切窮苦困厄以及悲慘的結局就永遠窺何在每一個有正義感的作家底周圍。從這一現象裹，很可以明白，偉大的作者必需具有犧牲的勇氣是如何重要的問題。</p>
<p>在他方面誰都知道，筆耕的路是最艱難的。特別是在中國，無名的筆耕者暫且按下不提；即使的酬報依舊不能從貧困綫的生活裹解放出來，也正是周知的事實。如棄我們是爲了個人的利害來打算，不消說，走上這一條筆耕的路是最倒霉的事。</p>

<h3 id="c218">讀趙秋舲詞 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 楊世驥</p>
<p>偶然讀到趙秋舲寄桂丹叔（金縷高）的重慶向西風哭，戲人生朡填塊學，酒澆不落。棋子從頭成錯著，不合苦將書讀，把多少心腸東縛！諸句，不禁有同感焉，因此對於這作者，就沒有如其餘的清代詞人一樣地忽略過。</p>
<p>趙秋舩的成就並不特高，稱得上佳好的作品在全部作品中所佔的數量也很微小，但在氣質的真摯上，他終是有清一代鮮見者；即使將他和納蘭容若比並一處，亦無遜色，蓋一者跌宕，一者綿鬰，而我個人恰是喜愛跌宕的情趣的。秋舲的集子在今日坊間不難尋獲，然知秋舲的名字的人，卻殊寥寥，我臺引爲異；其實何異之有，秋舲嘗於爲異；其實何異之有，秋舲嘗於題陳小魯集（金縷曲）中道：「可憐筆陣千人掃，奈　中他古今常例，詞塲紗帽。傳與不傳原偶耳，傳者豈皆絕調？只達士付之一笑。如此奇才偏抹殺，想天涯埋沒知多少。布衣耳，耳誰曉！」</p>
<p>關於秋舲的生平，從他集子的序跋和其友人梁晉竹的筆記裹，我只知道他字慶熹，仁和人。生於一八○三年（嘉慶辛已）。弱冠舉於鄉，未登館閣，旋至湖北，梓有楚遊草一卷；既返里，援徒爲業，如此落拓二十年……途二年，客死嶺南，作品復燔於火。其女友吳蘋香體爲理禮餘，成香銷酒麗詞曲各一卷。可是我也知道，知道他有著現今一般文人的最普遍的身世，那就是貧窮，傲岸，倦厭敎書的生活，怨謗著不遇，因此詞中每多感慨。如寄桂丹叔的第二圖：</p>
<p>「又近中秋矣。向青天，可憐負卻團團日子，黻桂小山花女發，眼底人俱千里。引無數別離滋味。燕子飛來飛又去，去年事，我猶記。故園無恙西風裹，總負他六橋煙柳，花天酒地。愁煞阿咸空四壁，難把家常話起，只報道年安而已。彈鋏不堪重乞食，走天涯又乏江湖技，詩酒耳，問何濟！」</p>
<p>沒落中的文人的悲哀，這里已寫了個大概。</p>
<p>秋舲詞裹寫景的地方，明白曉暢，別饒風致，像遊臯亭（臺城路）中諸句：「酒舫輕移，鈞竿新把，且學老漁身世。花開棟子，看風過搖涼，水痕都紫。兩岸人家，畫長門掩，正蠶市。枝頭青杏尚小，只桑陰豆莢，肥緣如脂。土滑哇平，衫記扇出，又過斜陽山寺。一寫春末夏初的江南風物，不可不謂真切。</p>
<p>秋舡少年時亦作綺施語，他詞中的小令，他的詩，他的曲，多是屬於這方面的。嗜之者譽以「出入花間」，或「追蹤溫李，」而這正是我們所不取處。當他在湖北時，其聘室卒，嘗作續離騷招魂哭之，末系（浣溪紗）一閱云：「檢點青衫有涙痕，十年前事最銷魂，偏地細雨又黃昏。鸚鵝一篇才子血，桃花三尺女兒魂，不知何處弔湘君。」這是最足以代表他在模擬的過渡中的作品。</p>
<p>秋舲篤於誼，廣交遊，他和他的友人如梁普竹，姚古芬，陳小魯，徐寶嬋輩，對於文學都有同一的嗜好，同一的見地，和同一的遭遇。到後來星散零落，他的境況自是不用言喻的。秋艙有一封致梁晉竹的信，述他們分別前後之種種，其末一段，極爲動人，今摘於此；「人生中年以往，有哀無樂，頗思十五年前，君家詩社，姚家酒社，飛觴選韻，張宴評花，方謂此樂，吾輩未艾：不意轉瞬，飄芬如此！舊遊如夢，恨不登鳳鳳山頂，搔首問天。然使當世有吾二人在，此樂終有望也。惟願天涯珍重，僕　亦同之。故鄉諸友，肅雲不獲見，閩甫四月一見，甫侶彼此欲見而不得見，受笙不時常見，尋園永不再見，晉竹惟書中一見耳。」</p>
<p>秋舲及其友人，在當日名皆不彰，他們自不免要牢騷滿腹的。像秋舲的題徐寶幢集（百字令）有「此中有恨，人生難得知已！「不妨狂語，諸君浪得名耳！」句，能知道他們的憤懣。憑惦而論，秋舲等在清代詞壇，總算是差足自立的作者，再從他「恠諸公摹宋復摹唐，殭蠶裹。」句，可以看見他們亟欲自立的心願。他又有譽陳小魯的「滿紙白苗秋水影，落華山林氣概，在蘇柳秦黃之外。」句，我以爲此地就用這幾句作傳述他的結語，決不會過寵或失當的。</p>

<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>打去年春間起金久的爸爸開始不平常的嗆咳了。</p>
<p>那是個中年人，高高的身材，連脖子也是那麼高，襯出了一個更顯得瘦小了的腰圍，不管是穿單褂或短棉襖的時候，腰間總束著一根青布帶。他的喫飯傢伙是一大箱木頭人和一個底下帶著藍布帳幔的戲石臺，那藍布帳幔底下剛夠金久爸容身，他一面在摔動那些小木頭人，一面嘶著嗓子喊唱著，有時尖得剌耳，有時沙亞得像一個沒有松香的破胡琴。</p>
<p>他每天挑著迨逼沉重的擔子串胡同去，敲著一面小鑼，沿著一些陌生或熟識的小胡同找著買責，有時連著在一些有孩子的門前走過而逗得孩子天天要看要森頭人戲時，金久爸便要受到一些女人的呵斥了，她們怪他不該天天來騙銅子兒。</p>
<p>「已經落到了三十枚要一回的價錢呵！」</p>
<p>雖然那樣辯著，金久爸還不能不低著頭又滑過一條街，他輕輕地透著氣，計算著洋碼，前些年換三十吊時要一回也要四吊，合一毛多，如今是五十多吊的洋價了。</p>
<p>「越費力越窮了哩！」那樣想著。他是匆忙地在一處演完又抹抹汗再跑，好把貶落了的錢從多要幾回裹掏回來，家裹的幾張嘴并沒有減低飯量呢。然而當在胡同裹只聽見自已手敲小鑼的回響而聽不見主雇的呼喚時，金久爸便抬著灰眼失了神地思念：</p>
<p>「人們都窮了似的。」</p>
<p>可是，他又清楚地記得當跨過一大道改變串胡同的方向時，他分明眼見電影院戲館子裹的雲一樣湧的觀客。</p>
<p>在躊躇不解裹，他揣著那顆焦急的心蹓聽著出賣他的技藝，有時候少幾個子他也馬虎了，再不然便討點好多演幾齣。</p>
<p>「嘟嘟嘟，哎喲……」</p>
<p>盡著力唱，夾著道白，他的戲裹常有「王大娘鋸缸」和「豬八戒掃女人」，有時也扯著「三國演義。」</p>
<p>金久爸的背漸漸彎了下去，細長的脖子伸出著。嗓子越發沙啞起來，但他醮見金久那孩子挨著母親身旁嘴窩頭嫌不飽時，便在心上打上個黑印，唸道著明天總要多演兩塲讓一家人多有幾個窩頭下肚。</p>
<p>他把工作時間延長了，早上也少在家裹逗孩子玩木頭人，晚上非天黑不回來。</p>
<p>覺得力量越來越不夠，兩腿不到半天便會疲痛起來時，金久爸暗罵著自已，才中年人哪！然而，不矇人的是走多了路之後的頭暈，有一回就那麼在連演兩次之後跌跌撞撞地倒在扁擔上，眼前一陣昏黑，險些兒倒了下去。</p>
<p>慢慢地，嗆咳來了，只是在嗓子眼兒裹那麼一點，可又非常費勁兒。</p>
<p>女人瞧出了這現象。</p>
<p>男的搖搖頭：「招了涼咧！」</p>
<p>瞞不過女人的銳利的眼，她曾看見過街坊們有過這病兒，而且因這點病兒加深死去的。一個東西恫嚇著她：</p>
<p>「癆！」</p>
<p>她在關帝廟裹鐘了響頭。</p>
<p>又打哪兒弄來一包不要錢的仙方，給男的沖水喝了。（未完）</p>

<p>我國往來華南各處電報，以廣州爲中心。其電路（甲）由有缐電傳遞者：（一）由上海出發，經滬福直達缐至福州，再經廈門，油頭。而至廣州。（二）由漢口出發，經九江·南昌·贛州·越大庚嶺違韶州，而至廣州。（三）由漢品出發，至長沙·衡州·郴州·韶州·而至廣州：或由衡州·永州·桂林·梧州而至廣州。（乙）其由無缐電傳遞者有二：（一）粵漢直達，（三）滬廣自遠。（丙）其由水線傳遞者，由外商大北公司所設之滬港水缐而達香港，轉至廣州。此華南電路之大略情形也。</p>
<p>查上項有缐電路，迭受匪共摧毀之故，多已年入失修。粵漢直達，（係經廣潯漢電路者）阻斷逾二十年，其餘各路，支離破碎，從未開放直達。近年湘閩贛三省各段桿缐，雖因軍事進展，隨時搶修，然因陋就簡，工事不堅，不能直達工作，輾轉遞報稽延時日，若遇天時或盜匪阻斷，尤爲誤事。故以前國內各商行發寄華南電報，因其準確可靠，多願加付水缐費，而由滬港水缐拍轉，數十年以來，喪失利權，何可勝數！及滬漢粵三處無缐電臺成立，開放滬廣粵漢兩路直達，挽回利權不少。但以電機容量有限，若將華南各報均交兩路拍轉，事實上固所難能，且終不免擁擠延誤之虞。</p>
<p>交通部爲疏通南北電信交通起見，茲擇粵漢最捷之缐路，（即長衡韶廣缐路）積極整理，加設桿缐，以期直達。其餘如贛閩兩省缐路，亦正著手修理。關於湘粵缐路工程去年六月，即開始進行，中經贛匪竄湘之擾亂，至今年一月始告完成，粵漢直達，已於二月十一日通報，成績甚佳，來往電報，迅速凖確，二十餘年粵漢直達阻斷之缐，今由湘今省開放完成，從此華南消息，瞬息即達中原，對於全國通訊上當有莫大貢獻也。</p>
<h3 id="c222">電政舊債整理後書感 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 儲浩</p>
<p>前北京政府交通部時代，曾先後向日·英·德·美·等國外商訂借各項電政債欵，爲數甚鉅，其合同條件既極苛刻，利率又高，更有預付利息之規定。歷年交通部因電欵支絀，所償外債之欵，爲數極微，非惟談不到本，即言付息，亦不足什一，因之本利複算，債務日增，截至二十三年年底止，本息合計，以目前金價折合國幣計算，總計負債達八千萬元以上。交部歷任主管長官，對於該項債務，咸有戒心，迄未得整理辦法。自朱家驊氏長部後，鑒於此項債務，長此久宕不決，本利愈積愈大，若不妥籌辦法，及早解決，整個電政事業，勢將破產。乃秉承行政院，派員辦理，數閱月之交涉，分別與各債權人另訂償還新辦法，債權人對於一切固有的權利，咸予放棄。此種諒解態度，值得吾人讚美，而馬可民代表謂其仿中英庚欵辦法，可促進兩國邦交，尤爲誠摯之語。故此次整理債務之結果，非特還本付息，較舊約減省數千萬元，即我國邦交上，亦增進不少。不可謂非吾電政界近年以來非常之事！其詳細辦法，已誌各報，茲不多贅。爰書所感，以供關心電信事業者之研討。</p>
<p>查交部積欠各項電政舊債，爲電政經濟不能鞏固之癥結，十數年來，吾電政界所遭受之痛苦與束縛，亦以此爲最甚。歷任交通當局，雖皆諗知上項舊債一日不解決，電政前途一日不能安，第以負債過鉅，整理乏術，故雖催索盈門，急如星火，總以敷衍延宕之手段，爲搪塞一時之計。殊不知債權債務，律有明文，事涉外商，關係國際信譽，偶爾應付不慎，不圖根本解決辦法，則影響所及，有不堪設想者也。</p>
<p>查各項電政借欵合同中，如舊交部與中日實業公司所訂之擴充電話偕欵同，及與西方電氣公司合辦中國電氣公司均有購料優先權之規定，辦法既先後矛盾，糾紛遂因之而起；如向甲公司訂購材料，乙公司以優先權爲詞出而干涉，如向乙公司訂購材料，甲公司亦以同樣理由提出異議，如向甲乙兩公司以外之料商購料，則責難更重重而至，凡此種種，交部時有窮於應付之苦，且因債項久火不還，對作信用喪失之故，公司每將料價暗中提高。而交部以合同關係，雖明知損失，亦祇得忍痛承受，因此歷年電信購料上之損失，亦不可以數計，此其一。再歷任交通當局對於電政債務，莫不關心，但以該項債務從未整理，無止確之數字，究竟積欠至若何程度，不得而知。因之電政全部收支預算，無從確立。且因各項合同條件苛刻之故，種種新的設施，動受牽制，遂致阻礙重重，難言發展。此其二。各項電政債欵中，爲數最鉅而性質最嚴重者；一爲民國九年二月十日舊交部與日商東亞興業株式會社訂借之擴充及改良有綫電報工程費墊欵，計日金一千零二十二萬二千零二十元四角七分。以有綫電報全部財產爲擔保。一爲民國七年十月舊交部與中日實業公司所訂之擴充電話借欵，計日金一千萬元，係以現有及將來擴充之全部電話財產與應用權爲抵押，其後舊交部復續向該公司購買材料增加欠額約日金六百五十萬元。上兩項借欵，雖經交部陸續償還，但爲數甚微，不足付息，故截至去年底止，積欠本息，合計超過本金一倍有奇，長此延宕不了，勢必愈積愈多，茍一旦債權人感於索償無著，悲憤俱來，轉而挾其國家的力量，要求處分擔保品，吾人實無應付方法。瞻念前途，不寒而慄，此其三。</p>
<p>有此三因，吾知電政當局年來雖以百折不撓之精神，埋頭苦幹，奮勇向革新振興之大道邁進，但以鉅債當前，危機四伏，人人心坎中，咸有惴惴不安者在。今各項債務，幸告圓滿解決矣，苛酷條件，廢除盡凈，無異久被桎梏之人，一旦自由解放，其愉快寛慰有不可以語言形容者矣！從此荊棘蕩盡，隱憂已除，種種計劃，可以按步進行，無所顧慮，亦無所牽制。故電政債欵之清理，在整個電政史上含有劃時期的重要性，現任當局諸公深遠卓絕之見解，明智果斷之精神，尤足令人欽敬讚偑者也。</p>
<p>自茲以後，深望各界共體艱危，各輸真誠，對於以前所欠電費，應設法償還，對於以後各項電賀，絕對須照須照意付現。電政經濟得以昭蘇，而交部此次所訂整理債務計劃，不慮中斷，國家前途，實利賴之，豈獨電政而已載！</p>
<h3 id="c223">上海長途電話接綫合同簽訂之經過及其影響 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 藏周</p>
<p>市內電話興長途電話，一則爲短距離之通訊，一則爲長距離之通訊，二者各有其功效。惟長途電話，若不有市內電話爲其尾間，則末由發展，市內電話，必有長途電話供其推廣，而後功用益顯，蓋必通力合作，如車輔相依，方能達到相距千里之外如晤言一室之內也。</p>
<p>上海爲我國第一大埠，握全國商業金融之樞紐，環而繞之者，蘇南浙北，復多政治上商業上之城市，是以滬地市內電話與長途電話之接綫聯絡，異常需要。顧長途電話係交通部所辦，租界內之市內電話係外商所辦，經營主體之不同，而接綫問題因之發生矣。</p>
<p>考上海租界市內電話與長途電之接綫，肇始於民國十五年五月交通部上海電話局與上海華洋德律風公司簽訂之長途電話合同。是項合同，係根據十四年簽訂之華洋通話合同，關於收費辦法，規定公司用戶使用長途電話，不論呼出或呼入，公司得在通話費外，每次加收大洋五分，作爲手續費。二十一年五月，合同滿期，交通部當即派員與上海電話公司（即繼承華洋德律風公司經營租界電話者）磋商續訂新合同，惟適以原合同所根據之華洋通話合同，已經滿期，尚未簽訂新約，長途電話接綫合同，未便升先行解決，此案遂告擱淺。直至二十二年四月，華租電話臨時合約已正式簽訂，交部復派員向公司繼續接洽，歷久未有結果。</p>
<p>至此次新合同之簽訂，則發動於上海電話局之要求增加中繼綫。緣上海長途話務，發展極遠，而租界方面，實佔十之八九，現在長途話綫接至上海長途臺者，計有京滬沿鐵路綫五對，京滬沿公路綫六對，滬杭綫二對，滬松綫二對，總共十五對，而華租間之中繼綫僅有八對，對八對之中繼綫應付十五對之長途綫其不敷分配，當可想見。上海電話局迭向電話公司要求增加中繼綫，電話公司提議續約問題，並認爲增加中繼綫之先決條件，交涉因之繼續進行。而雙方爭議之點，則在公司擁分話費辦法，交部欲維持原案，即無論來話去話，公司每次攤分五分，公司方面則要求找安照話費總數，去話攤分百分十之十五，最少一角，最多一元五角，來話攤分百分之五，最少五分，最多一元五角。最後雙方讓步，商定去話公司得百分之十，來話公司得百分之五，其最低最高限度均爲五分及一元五角，於本月七日，由電話局與電話公司正式簽訂合同。</p>
<p>合同簽訂後所發生之結果；舉其最要者有二，即中繼綫之添設及公司攤分費之增加是也。按現在上海長途話務，以京滬綫爲最繁，交通部特於最短期間，建築沿公路新長途綫路，原冀京滬話務，得以速通，顧新綫完成後，京滬話務，擁擠如故，良以上海之長途中繼綫不能增加，則新增之京滬綫形同虛設，新合同既經簽訂，中繼綫自可增加，各方話務定可暢通矣。復次關於公司攤分，話費辦法，此次電話公司希望頗奢，雖經交通部磋商核減，而最後結果，較之原案，查差懸殊，嗣後交通部每月付給電話之公司之手續費，將有大量之增加，必無疑矣。然而，交通部爲增加收入，著重於後項，二者之目的固不同也。</p>
<h3 id="c224">政軍機關協同取締私事官電 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>閱交通公報第六一七號，載軍事委員會委員長南昌行營政治訓練處致交通部公函，略稱；「準函爲十一師政訓處用本處電紙拍發私電，囑查明申誡，並通令取締等由，附原電底一件到處；準此。查私用官電之李某，（記者姑隱其名）業經撤職究辦，至私人拍發官電，早經本處通令取締」等語，又載贛粵閩湘鄂剿匪軍西路總司令部上年十一月祃代電稱；「前準元代電，爲長沙電局扣留茶陵私事官電二件，請查明發電人，予以申誡等由。當經電飭劉軍長建緒查覆在卷。茲據劉軍長哿代電稱；功代電敬悉，已遵令申誡該發電人等，並飭屬以後不得再發私電矣，特此奉達」等語。吾人閱此一函一電，足證明現今政軍當局重視電政法令之一斑矣。</p>
<p>查私事不得發寄官電，早經國民政府於十八年通飭政軍機關遵照，并經交通部規定辦法佈告週知在案。但兩年以前，軍事倉皇，各政軍機關職員不明電政法令，常以私事持用印電紙到局拍發官電，偶與理論，勵氣凌人，如將該電扣留不發，則咆哮之已，甚至以「貽誤戎機」相恐嚇者。電局人員，受其威迫，只得暫時收下拍發，一面呈報交通部核示，公文往還，動需時日。迨交部覆文到時，該員已隨該機關開㧞他處矣。該員見其在甲地電報局以武力發寄私事官電爲例，於是在乙地或丙地電報局，亦同樣爲之。浸假而視爲軍人應享之權利，浸假而將印電紙借給非軍人發電，浸假而局中少數不肖職員以印電紙代替商人發電，流弊百出，相襲成風，電欵損失，不可勝計。此種情形，軍事時期或邊遠地點爲尤甚，記者固已累見不鮮矣。</p>
<p>近年以來，私事官電，經交通部嚴加取締，并規定發報局中間局收報局查扣私電及其獎罰辦法，電局人員，亦認爲取締私事電報，爲整理電政之要圖，努力推行，成績卓著。茲將二十一年二十二年各區扣留私電次數字數字數列表如左</p>
<p>廿一年廿二年各區扣留私電次數字數表。</p>
<p>由上觀之，可知私事官電，決難逃查扣之列，今又得政軍機關爲之恊助，違者撤職究辦，嗣後政軍機關人員，　　或項電報之必　扣留，又知發寄此項電報之必受懲處，決不得因貪個小利而受重大損失。私事官電或可絕跡於電局矣。</p>
<h3 id="c225">羅馬字母電碼的用法 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 清華</p>
<p>—國外僑胞注意—</p>
<p>交通部刋行之「明密電碼新編」內，電碼部份較普遍坊間印售之電碼書，多一種羅馬字母電碼（即洋文電碼），每三個字母代表漢字一個。此項電碼之唯一優點，爲節省報費，凡國外僑胞與祖國往來電報，可省報費百分之六十四，實較洋文明語電報更爲省費。茲先舉例說明於後：</p>
<p>例如「貨到欵速匯」五字，如用華文四碼拍發，則譯6303　0451　2949　6643　0565五碼，每碼均作一字全價計費。假定每字價目爲一元則應收費五元。如用羅馬字母電碼拍發，則可將該五字先譯成RAO　ARJ　HUS　SGL　AVT　五碼，然此後將五碼聯成BAOARJHUSSGIAV，再按每五個字母分成三碼如，下：RAOAR　JHUSS　GIAVT。以上三碼作三字計費，且可享受六折收費之優待，即祇收費一元八角而已。兩相比較，報費相差三元二角之多，可知使用羅馬字母電碼之利益矣！</p>
<p>惟使用此項電碼者，對於下列各點，必須注意：</p>
<p>一，與親友或有關商行往來電報之前，應先購買交通部刋行之「明密電碼新編」數冊，送贈親友或擬與往來電報之人，並告其注意此項電碼之使用方法（書內載有用法說明）。最好先用郵信試譯一次，以免發生誤會。</p>
<p>二，此項電碼祇能用於電文，所有電報內之收電人姓名住址應仍用洋文或華文明碼，以免電局無法投遞。</p>
<p>三，如由國外發寄本國之電報，電發人事先未曾通知收電人使用此項電碼者，可在電文之前加“PDAIN”字，表示此電係用羅馬字母電碼，電局收到時，當照華文明碼來報例代爲譯成文字投送，惟以國外來電爲限，去電因外國電局不負翻譯之責也。</p>
<p>四，去電電文如祇四字，則譯成羅馬字母十二個（每字譯成字母三個），再按每五個字分成一碼，則成兩碼，多兩個字母，此兩個字母亦可作爲一碼，因洋文密碼每碼祇限不得超過五個字母，如少於五個字母，亦可作爲一碼也。</p>
<p>五，交通部編印之「明密電碼新編」，每冊定價二角，各地電局電臺均有出售，如已售罄，可逕函南京交通部電政司購買。對於該項電碼，如有疑問，可逕函本社，當詳細奉答。</p>
<p>六，國內往來電報對於洋文密碼並無六折收費之優待，且洋文電報價目倍於華文，例如「貨到欵速匯」五字，照華文價目祇收費五角，如改成洋文密碼三字，則須收費六角，反不合算，故不宜使用此項電碼。</p>

<p>— 葆真</p>
<p>交通部爲便利布內電話用戶收發電報起見，曾經訂定「市內電話收發電報辦法」一種，自去年二月一日起，公布施行。按照該項辦法之規定，凡各地市內電話用戶如欲利用電話收發電報者，得向當地電報局或無綫電臺聲請註冊，約定暗號並預付足夠半個月報費之存欵後，始可開始收發電報。（但電話用戶如不欲用電話發報者，可無須預付報費存欵。）上項辦法確係手續完備，規劃周詳。對於電報往來較多之電話用戶，甚爲便利。但平時電報往來較少之電話用戶，雖欲利用，因其收發電報並不很多，如欲聲請註冊，必須經過繳納註冊費及預付報費存欵等項手續。不免稍感麻煩。倘不照此辦理，電報局或無綫電臺格於定章，不能通融允許。故此項辦法，對於電報往來較多之電話用戶，固屬便利，而一般電話用戶，仍不能普遍享受也。</p>
<p>最近交通部電政司爲補救上項缺點起見，另行訂定「○○電話局用戶利用電話傳發電報辦法」一種，（見二月十日申報）並由電話局在電報局報房內裝設話機兩架，專供報局收聽電話用戶所發電報之用，按照上項辦法之規定。凡市內電話用戶無須向當地電報局或無綫電臺聲請註冊，僅須約定暗號，及預付報費存欵。隨時可以撥呌第×××××號電話（即電話局在電報局報房內所裝之專裝電話）與電報局收報員通話傳發電報，由電報局收報員將電報抄錄完畢後，即可編定去報號數按照該電收報地名應經之路由，送交值機員拍發，手續異常迅捷，所需電報費，且可由電報局暫時記賬，至月終由電話局代向用戶收取，尤爲便利。此後電話用戶足不出戶，就可隨時發電。可謂簡捷之至。茲聞上項辦法暫由上海天津兩地先行試辦。一俟著有成效，再爲推行於各大都市。記覩面望將來各大都市之電話用戶，均可得到利用電話隨時傳發電報機會，俾電話電報兩種通信工具，可以通力合作多多爲民衆服務。至此項辦法之內一，請向當地電報局接洽可也。</p>

<p>本刋承顧君惠函詢問關於洋文電報計費辦法。茲特就垂詢各節，分別答復如下：</p>
<p>問·（一）鄙人前在北平時，發寄洋文國際電報甚多，所有此項電報之收報人姓名住址，常用Ｃhineselegation或Sinslegation字樣，向來不論發往何國均按一字計費。何以最近由滬發往北平及國外各處之洋文電報，凡用Britishlegation,Frenchlegation,Spanishlegation,Sinolegation等字樣作爲收報人姓名住址者，電局對於各該電收報人姓名住址內所用之Britishlegation,Frenchlegation,Spanishlegation,Sinolegation等字，概須按照兩字計費。不知有何根據？請解釋爲荷。</p>
<p>答·查洋文明語電報內所用連寫之字，除能證明係電報掛號字外，無論在住址，電文，或署名內均應分別計費。臺端由滬發往北平及國外各處之洋文電報，其收報人姓名住址內所用Britishlegation,Fr(nchlegation,Spanishlegation,Sionlegatlon,Chineselegation)等字，均係連寫之字，而非各該收報人在電局登記這掛號字。（按我國駐外各公使館之掛號字爲Ｓinolegate,英國駐華公使館之掛號字爲Ｐrodrome及Britatin,法國駐華公使館之掛號字爲Legafrance惟西班牙公使館所用掛號字未詳）因各該字所含羅馬字母，均在十個以上，顯與電報掛號間程規定之「洋文電報掛號字，最多以十個羅馬字母爲限」一節，有所牴觸也。來函所述，容有誤會之處。或者臺端在北平時所發國際電報，均用掛號字Sinolenate代替收報人姓名住址，而非用連寫之字Sinolegation,Shineselegation代替收報人姓名住址，而非用連寫之字Sinolegation,故電局照章按一字收費，而由滬發寄北平及國外各處之電所用之Sinolegation,Shineselegation等連寫之字，作爲收報人姓名住址者，照章應按兩字計費，電局通知補費，當係按照國際電信公約附屬電報規則第六章第十八條第九節第一段「凡湊合或改竄之字，違反其所屬文字之習慣用法者，概不準用。」辦理尚無不合。（未完）</p>

<p>— 社友</p>
<p>滬津開放電話傳發電報</p>
<p>交通部爲謀滬津電話用戶發寄電報便使利起見，特訂定電話傳發電報辦法，凡上海及天津電話局之用戶均可隨時利用電話傳發電報，事前無須聲請登記，亦不需預繳保證金，手續簡單便利，用戶發電時，祇須撥呌電報局規定之電話號碼（上海話局規定南市2119321194），呌到後先將電話號數及記名報告，然後將電話掛斷，靜待電局撥呌，呌到時電局詢開一遍，即可將電文逐字或逐碼讀出，電局逐字抄錄後，再複述一次，如校對無誤，即將電報發出，發出後將電報副本註明應收報費交差送請原電發人親自核閱簽字蓋章後，交差帶回電局存證，所有應收報費則俟月終開單收取。此項辦法可使發電人足不出戶可拍發電報，其便利誠與歐美各國不相上下，足見交通當局近來對於電報事業之力求商業化也。（詳細辦法可向上海或天津電報局詢問）</p>
<p>分抄電報抄費收取辦法</p>
<p>凡收報人有兩個以上而同在一地者，發報人爲省費起見，可拍發分抄電報，此項電報祇按一電收費，惟須加收抄費，此項抄費，原來係照加抄份數計算，例如收報人共有三人，則加收抄費三份，每份二角，即收費四角。惟照現行國際電報規則第六十一條之規定，抄費應照收報人數計算。例如分抄三份即收費六角，其原因爲收報電局抄送時，並不照來電全部抄送，照章應另備來報紙三張，每份祇抄一個收報人之姓名住址及電文，使收報人並不知發報人尚同時發致他人，故電局手續上確係分抄三份，並非加抄二份，交部現爲使國際及國內電報抄費收取辦法一律起見，已令飭各電局自三月一日起，一律照分抄份數計算云。</p>
<p>取消長途電話預繳證金</p>
<p>查各電話局用戶使用長途電話，照章須預繳保證金，以免拖欠長途話費，此項辦法對於話局收費上，雖有一保障較爲穩妥，但用戶方面非事先預繳保證金，總嫌不便，交部現爲便利用戶推廣業務起見，令首都上海兩電話局先行試辦，如試辦結果甚佳，其餘各處話局亦將推行辦理云。</p>
<p>立院通過國際電信公約</p>
<p>一九三二年西京瑪德里國際電報及無缐電會議通過之國際電信公約及各項附屬規則，向例應由各簽約國政府批準，我國自簽訂該約後，昨已二年，經交部將原案呈請行政院轉咨立法院審議，現已經該院於二月八日第四屆立法委員第一次大會通過，日內即可呈請國府明令批準，以完手續云。</p>

<h3 id="c229">中國文化的建設 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>讀完了一篇「中國本位的文化建設宣言」，我們彷彿在中國文化的前途，發現了一綫的曙光！</p>
<p>先年英國文豪蕭伯納游歷中國時，對於我國文化的觀察，曾經下過這樣的批評：「中國沒有文化」。中國果真沒有文化嗎？中國果真是個沒有文化的國家嗎？蕭氏此語，究竟含有如何的意味？其於文化的性質，又作怎樣的解釋？誠我人所不得而知！</p>
<p>中國是個古文明而孕育在五千年歷史上的文化國！我們敢這樣自誇。我們這樣自誇並不過分：因爲中國的文化，在世界文化的領域中，亦佔有極重要的位置。然而此是已往的光榮；現今卻變成一個何等樣的情形了呢？</p>
<p>在那篇宣言裹，開頭就指示出來：「在文化的領域中，我們看不見現在的中國了」！這即是今日的中國。蕭氏「中國沒有文化」的斷語，是不無相當的見地。於是中國人感到了苦悶，胡亂摸案，拚命掙扎！有的在倡著「復古」向古人的墳墓中鑽，想對骷髏去乞靈：有的在嚷著「趙新」，爭奪歐美化的渣滓，希望在渣滓裹檢出一點「救命丹」。可是結果是同一的失望！</p>
<p>然則中國文化就這樣聽其滅亡了嗎？絕對不是的！中國的文化，現在雖陷入於一個鳥煙癉氣的氣圍中：我們卻應抱著堅決無畏的精神，從這氛圍中，排除萬難，來建立一種新文化！我們要從事於新文化的建設，我們自當由檢閱過去的中國，把握現在的中國，建設將來的中國，這三方面去努力。</p>
<p>中國的新文化，就是中國本位的文化。這種文化，應合乎時代和環境，而且要適於我們的需要。一班復古論者，以爲凡古代的思想制度，都是美善的：所以主張一切應以古爲範，這是忽略了時代性。至於提倡趨新的，以爲凡歐美的新奇事物，皆是優良的：我們應該盡量去模仿。這又忽略了空間性。須知古代的文化，有善亦有惡：歐美的文化，有優亦有劣。且一種文物之適於古代文化的選擇，和歐美文化的吸收，精華而合於時代環境的需要者。則存之取之：粗粕而不合於時代環境的需要者，則廢之棄之。這是今後肩負著建設中國新文化之責者所不可不注意的。</p>
<p>我們希望中國新文論建設成功之後，不但使中國文化，能恢復過去的光榮，和外國並駕齊驅；且對於世界文化，亦能有珍貴的貢獻！</p>
<h3 id="c230">新豐春 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>新豐春是我家貼隣的京廣雜貨店，同時也是我們鎮上惟一的百貨商店。老關是被人呌做笑彌陀的一個老實商人—從我能夠記憶的時候起，他就頂著這個稱號的，而他的真姓氏反漸漸遺忘了。其實這個稱號對他是再適合不過的：是一個過量的大胖子，他的挺出底肚子，可以從一個即將分娩的婦女的那裹占到勝利。在夏天的晚上，他赤裸了上身，在門前納涼，那條彷彿小樹根那末粗健的手臂揮著芭蕉扇的時候，腦後和兩乳旁側的肥肉是海浪一般地洶湧著，然而最象形的地方是他一雙永遠迷著一條線的眼睛及一雙扁闊的嘴巴。他是民國元年到我們鎮上來的，租了我家貼隣堂伯的餘屋，設一個小糖食攤過著獨身生活。</p>
<p>等到我每天放學歸家把母親給我的銅元到他店裹買糖食的時候，已經略具一家鄉鎮雜貨店的雛型了。這時間內的一段奮門史，他是時常作爲一個動人的故事似的搬講著的：故鄉有一句笑話：沒有聽過笑彌陀的故事的不是我們鎮上人。</p>
<p>這一句笑話，在笑彌陀是引以爲榮的：但是他並不自滿，他做親後，夫妻倆個更是克勤克儉的做人家。我記得很清楚，我上城裹訊中學的時候，父親給我帶到校裹充飢的黑棗子也是從他店裹買出來的。新豐春的招牌彷彿就在那時候掛出來的，據他自已告訴人這招牌還是他帶到鎮上來設攤時用著的，不過當初是用著反而罷了。至於這塊招牌他爲什麼作爲寶物似的隨身帶來，又引起他的一段舊事，是光復那年的事，他在上海一家南貨店裹做學徒，打兵工廠的那夜，他藉這招牌保全了性命，新豐春三字就是他東家的招牌。這故事許多人是並不信以爲真的，然而，新豐春在我們</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>鎮上著名起來是實在的事實；而且漸漸傳播到四鄉去。——這自然也有個原因，因爲到城裹去的水陸兩路，都要經過我們這小鎮。有時碰見笑彌陀上城辦貨去，大家託他帶點東西，這些東西自然是他店裹所沒有的，這引動了笑彌陀的靈機，他就把這些東西都採辦起來，價錢卻和城裹一般無二，這樣營業的興隆是可以預卜的。</p>
<p>時光真快，我訊完了四年中學（舊學制，）新豐春是名副其實一月雜貨店了，統凡五香荳，粗紙，筍乾，紅黑棗，洋火，鄉下人一切需用的物件，他店裹沒有一件遺漏了的。</p>
<p>以後，我到上海來訊大學，可是爲了父親的死亡而家道中落，輟學後爲衣食奔波，同時把母親接到上海來同居著，於是故鄉就隔離而遺忘了。去歲年底，堂伯故世，重返故鄉時候是一個落日底黃昏，因了行色忽忙，沒有注意到那個一雙永遠瞇著一條缐的眼睛及一隻扁闊的嘴巴底笑彌陀，第二天爲了伯父喪事中所用的物件，伯母飭長工到城裹去採辦時才想起了他；一問人家，那回答的人先是搖著頭，告訴我一個凄傷的故事，總結起來是他老婆跟漢子跑了，笑彌陀自已吊死了！</p>
<p>懷了二重悲哀歸上海，不由得想起那句笑話；沒有聽過笑彌陀的故事的不是我們鎮上人，而新豐春三字更彷彿生了根的在腦海裹浮沉著。</p>
<p>那個終生奮門的老實商人呵，如今和他的事業一同不復存在人間了！</p>

<h3 id="c232">椰子和榴梿 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 曼蓀</p>
<p>椰子和榴梿，是赤道國土的二件特產物。</p>
<p>廣大的圍林，植著整齊的椰子樹。一行一行被空地疏隔著。在那高高的樹叢上面，每月都成熟了椰子。中國人或馬來人把牠採下來，用著車或船，把牠載到市塲去。在商店前後的廣塲上，商人們和販賣者講好了價錢，便「一，二，三，四，……」地數起來。然後由工人破了硬殻，挖了肉，曬成乾，賣給榨油廠。椰肉被榨成了油，便可做點燈用，爲女人塗頭髪用：或是利用著椰肉的質料，製成肥皂等物。</p>
<p>椰園是一種熱帶特有的美景，是一種舒適的塲地。在炎炎的太陽光下。椰圖里在大幅的蔭影下是異常清涼，涼風吹得人心神舒爽，把赤熱的窒悶都給吹散了。在晚上，月亮篩下她白色的清光在地上，樹葉搖動她的情影。黑夜被神秘的氣氛所包圍，　　　　出了人間仙景。</p>
<p>如果造一間草屋在圖上，像圖主人所有的一樣。用木棲築起了屋腳，用木板築起了牆壁。留　窗向著四方，讓涼風吹透全個屋子。晚上在欄桿邊的走廊上，擺上一樽㖫酒，或是一杯咖啡，躺下來望著黑夜的樹的兀立，黑叢叢無數：或在月夜兀望月亮，做個清夢。興來時訊一首詩，看一篇故事，真是其樂無窮，人間仙界。</p>
<p>況且椰樹子下常是赤道上人玩戀愛把戲的地方，是一種全世界的禮俗所沒有防範的地方。這裹是赤裸裸的世界，是原始人的世界！文明人在這裹是沒有用的。</p>
<p>於是用椰子來代表赤道人的精神和生活方式，也是很爲確當的了。</p>
<p>○　○　○　○</p>
<p>榴梿果生滿著刺子，長在野林的地方。爛熟的時候，發著巨大的惡臭，其味似糞。吃起來卻是苦中帶甘，味道在口裹很久都不會消退。</p>
<p>中國人初到關的，是不敢吃的。等到一吃成了習慣，卻是「當了破衣還要吃榴梿果」的。像平地生長的人們一樣。</p>
<p>榴梿果一上了市，滿街也堆上了臭味了。那時果殻和果核遍地皆是，而人們是昏了頭遍吃榴梿果了。馬來人這樣，中國人這樣，便是有的歐洲人，也還是這樣。</p>
<p>吃榴梿果是頗不容易的。因爲殻子硬，又長滿了剌，應該小心地用刀子挖開來，然後在一片片的黃色的黏質上用手挖肉來吃。手既是沾滿了漿狀物，口發著惡臭。然而據說這樣吃才是快活的。</p>
<p>吃榴梿果的方式是最平民化的。最佳的方式是：把身子蹲下來，無論尊卑大小，搶著挖著肉吃，團團圍住果子的周圍。一直吃到果子剩得了皮殻，才戀戀地如有所失般地失開。</p>
<p>所以，便是以吃榴梿果的方法和一般人的興奮和沈醉看來，也足象徵著赤道地帶的精神和生活方式呵！</p>
<p>○　○　○　○</p>
<p>把椰子和榴梿來做赤道的標記，真是最確當沒有的了。</p>
<h3 id="c233">羅隱涌 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>在古舊的地方名字上，常常隱有許多神話，或者歷史的故事。而「羅隱涌」便是其一。這只是一個小地方，可是這小地方卻每年有一次是鼎盛熱鬧的辰光，這辰光便是炎熱的暑天時，參神拜幟的神婦，而及騷人墨客們到鼎湖山的一個必經之地。因此在大多數的從廣東來的朋友口中，總會聽到這一個富有詩意的地名。</p>
<p>「羅隱涌」這夠多麼詩意哩。一個隱土般的地方。這裹是一些農民，在種著旱田，雖然地不大好，可是照南方老例，一年兩次收穫，還是從不脫期的，人是那樣地忠厚，那樣樸實，雖然每年有這很多都市氣味吹來，可總不會傳染上一次的。雖然男的有時也賭博，可是總未出過一回岔事的；而女的卻更勤懇，田禾時節得到田下去幫勞，而田空時，又到山裹去刈草斬柴取燃料。這詩意的地方，真有點隱士氣味。當我從鼎湖山下來時，總在這裹辭慈去一黯時候的</p>
<p>這一次，我和一個朋友在深秋的時候，偶而高興到鼎湖山去了，下了山來，也就依照老例到這地方打尖歇歇。一個小茶樓，有點心和茶賣的，是準備著客人的午食的。自然，過了那熱鬧時節，這裹是只有冷清清地寂寞了，可是我卻正儆愛這沒有都市氣氛的寂寞，所以這一次卻特別顯得有點留戀。或者是因爲這一次以後，我便得撇下了這以往一切熟練的東西，而走了陌生的寂寞的浮浪之途的春戀著的原故吧。對於這熟練的一切，也用我感傷的眼珠瞟著。</p>
<p>「這小地方他有點變了。」我對這旅途的朋友說著。，確真有點異樣。</p>
<p>「自然，一切都變了時，這也不會例外的。」</p>
<p>於是，我更留心，對於這裹的無論任何一件小物件。</p>
<p>「榖價跌咧，這趟，真了不得了。」</p>
<p>「天年不好，便怨天：天年好了，又不是一樣，怨得誰來？」</p>
<p>「真想不到，我們還是到省城去吧！」</p>
<p>「…………」</p>
<p>我的耳朶在對面枱上的兩個老農的口裹聽到了這些話，我瞟了他們一眼，皺紋佈滿額頭，雖然而腿還有點灼灼，可是勞苦下來的報酬是告訴他：已經老了的。這樣老的人，也要到省城去，難道去找死嗎？我的心是跳著。跳著。</p>
<p>四面是冷靜得很哩，店面是關門的多。平常在普通日也開的，如山貨店等，也關上了，跟茶樓上夥計一打聽，才曉得因爲生意少，現在非到壚期不開店了，因爲夥計們得在其餘別的地方去找飯吃哩。平常日也開門造生意的，現在只有在那熱鬧季節了。說到熱鬧季節，也冷落得多了，往年是四五條專渡船載客來，今年一半也沒有了。</p>
<p>「一年不如一年了。」</p>
<p>歸根結尾都是一樣的聲音。我們也相信，無論甚麼地方也不會「例外」的。時候到了，我們也就走了。當我們走上了渡船時，回首看那蔥蘢鄉村在暮色裹隱沒。</p>

<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>百種事業都受了經濟凋敝的打擊，戲劇界當然不能單獨置身事外。但是你卻沒有從演員們自已，聽見們們呻吟抱怨。你走過百老匯皇宮大戲院一帶，你就會覺得一片荒涼冷落的氣概。你亦會覺得多少戲院的裹面是黑越越的。你不覺替一般員們擔憂起來。</p>
<p>你對於年輕的演員們，或者還不十分關心。他們女的可以去做模特兒，男的可以賣蘇打水。但是那般老演員怎麼樣呢？他們怎樣安度這種風波？或者他們銀行裹有存欵。或者鄉下他們有產。但是，你且聽聽斐爾次（Ｗ.　C　Fields）的一段事蹟。</p>
<p>斐爾次到了五十歲了。他以爲他可以告老還鄉。他亦一心想著要退休。他在哈立門銀行裹，有存欵二十五萬，足夠他悠遊歲月之用的。但是哈立門銀行在不景氣之中倒閉了。那段新聞是你在報紙工讀到的。好萊塢有多少人受了極大的打擊。而斐爾次就是其中的一個。他的財產就此蕩然無存了。他非但不能退休，並且還要從頭做起。這是再悽慘不過的事了。一個人豈能再活五十年再去享受清閒之福呢？但是事到臨關，又將何說呢？結果他就再埋頭苦幹起來。</p>
<p>他做了多少次的努力，在各家大公司中尋求工作，但是一般製作家卻都沒有降階而迎。他後來他就不得不降格而求，在馬克桑納脫的滑稽短片中表演著。黑暗的水平綫上，漸漸發出一綫的曙光來，但是禍不單行，他又遇到了一件不測。大家拿他抬到醫院裹，他受了重傷。他的頸斷了。醫生將他的頭顱夾了起來，將他的頸項，放在石膏模型裹。他們將墻上的月份牌取了下，怕他看了心焦。</p>
<p>他一躺幾個月，還是睡不著的時候多，但也記不清是何年何月了。那亦許是造物狡獪，故意將病來磨折他，但在病後，他的命運卻又得了一個轉機。他病還沒有好全，派拉蒙已經派人手執合同，等在醫院門口了，原來，他在滑稽短片中的幽默，已經由他的不幸，促進了大家的注意。</p>
<p>現在斐爾次告訴人家說：「我從前以爲五十歲以可休養的話，顯見得是個錯誤。銀行的倒閉，是因爲我要偷懶給與我的懲罰。後來我正在爲金錢損失而傷心的時候，命運又將我的頸項折斷了。我現在謹告命運，我已不爲銀行倒閉而傷心，我亦不爲折頸而抱憾，請命運之神，無須再給我痛苦而懲罰我了。」</p>
<p>梅羅勃蓀（Ｍay　Robson）亦是晚年成名一位女明星。她現在卻和一般妖艷風騷的少女們門著風頭。她有一次因爲紐約添了一個重孫女，特爲到紐約來，有人問她。她卻答道：「疲倦？一些不覺得。我馬上就要回去拍新片子了。我現在不過像開車開到第二檔。那就是曼麗特蘭漱所喜歡說的話。她常說她要死在工作塲上的。她果然是死在工作塲上的。她所受的痛苦，是沒有人能了解的，但是她不是臨陣脫逃的人。她那種精神，亦就是我的精神。我幸而亦有那副精神。我在好萊塢是很忙的，一張片子沒有演完，一張片子又開始了。他們正需求著老年婦人。剛巧我是一個老年婦人，這豈不是我的幸運嗎？」（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c240">評「龍鳳奇緣」 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｎell　Gwyn-大上海</p>
<p>在「嫦娥愛少年」（Ａnna　Negle）主演的「龍鳳奇緣」，乃是值得人們注意的，至少在電影藝術的評價上，在黑暗伯威格斯（Ｈerhert　Wilcox）優秀的導演手法之下，她的表演以及整個的製片技術，都有著很好的藝術的成就。</p>
<p>關於宮幃歷史的攝製影片，我們看過很多，除了製片家的營業計畫上得著正確的解釋之外，差不多都是沒有其他意義的，自然有的也描寫了某一時代的政治黑幕，更反應了民間疾苦，如此使觀衆得有機會重溫歷史，進而爲科學的探討，決不是沒有意義的。可惜這種影片到底太少，而英美製片家所十分感覺興趣的，倒還是官幃中的羅曼斯，在偉大堂皇的塲面中與珠光寶氣的服裝的閃燦之下，他們是利用了現代的精良製片技巧，使人們迷惑在天堂般的幻境之中，於是他們勝利的微笑了。特別是這一官幃影片，除了看到英皇查理第二和女伶妮兒格溫的羅曼斯之外，差不多是看不到其他更重要的歷史事件的。</p>
<p>在這查理第二（Ｓtr　Cedrlc　Hardwlckc飾被寫成一個風流天子，他經幸女伶，但是他並不給女伶操縱政權。他走一個英明的帝王，同時也是一個多情的男子，直到他駕崩的時候，他近以女伶爲念，於是這給與人們深切同情的印象。當我們看見女伶在清晨寂寞地走出皇宮的時候，我們不會忘懷查理第二凄涼的死。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們可以顯明的看出劇作者在表現技巧上確是很夠把握的。他很單純的抓住幾件事來寫，將不必要的過程，一概以日記或字幕來說明。他將必要的幾點抓緊了，而且寫得非常充分。我們所看到的祇很簡單的故事，可是這是具體的，形象的地表現出來了的。</p>
<p>有了很好的劇本，對於導演當然方便不少，他除了對於置景很考據的地做成古色古香，使人們充分的引起懷古之感以外，而對於對的發展，尤爲注意。這裹我們可提出兩點作爲說明的例證。一爲女伶第一次進宮覲見的時候，先以報告菜名等，很嚴肅的描寫宮庭之氣氛，這時候是嘹亮的音樂，襯託出公爵夫人的趾高氣揚，（她是和女伶爭寵的）以及高貴的人們之致樂的笑聲。及至女伶上塲的時候，作爲效果使用的音樂便停止了，使公爵夫人受著難堪的侮辱，這理的心理描寫以至於當時的空氣，都由於音響的幫助，獲得極大的效果。其次我們要提出的便是最後的一場，死的空氣，女伶的哭泣，直到女伶寂寞的走出宮庭，這由於Ｍonetgo的適當和音響的支配，當時的情感確是極好的表現出來。</p>
<p>至於劇中人的個性的清楚，一方面固然是男女主角演技的優良，另一方面我們不能否認導演手法的高妙，這一影片除了內容的不夠充實之外，在技術上乃是十分優美的。</p>

<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>美國華納第一圖家出品　保羅牟尼·蓓蒂黛維絲主演</p>
<p>那破舊小帽下面的臉是嚴肅的同，但年事尚輕，目光㾋爍，嘴唇薄薄的，是他們種族所特具的。他的鞋上滿沾著長途的征塵。一輛運貨汽車，走到他面前，徐徐停了下來。那開車的人咕著道：「來吧，跳上來吧」。那站在地上的人問道：「多謝……你上那裹去」？那開車的道：「一直向南，遠著哩」。「好吧。我亦正要往南去」。他說著，就攀轅而上，坐在駕駛人的旁邊。那輛車就開足了幾百匹馬力，疾馳而去了。</p>
<p>那就是強尼拉米立斯，生長於桑諾拉城，落杉磯的墨西哥人種族而居的地方，那天離鄉背井，出門去征服天下的一天。強尼拉米立斯—一心想在這黃金遍地的新世界，勤苦工作著，做成一個林肯第二，並且想替他的老母，購買一件波斯洋皮的大衣。強尼拉米立斯—辛辛苦苦地在夜校裹訊了幾年法律，畢業演說中，亦嘗提到他的大名。強尼拉米立斯—他的母親當去了她的婚戒，替他做了一塊招牌，上面寫著：「強尼·法拉達·拉米立斯律師事務所。</p>
<p>拉米立斯家住在一家雜貨店的樓上，那雜貨店的門口，就掛著那塊招牌。任何人走過這墨西哥部骯辦的街道上的，那裹有陳列在道旁的盆盆罐罐，那裹有浮薄少年，穿著顏色喧聞的衣服，眼睛一瞟一瞟的，那裹有穿著連衣袴外罩的墨西哥農尼，四面還有音樂之聲，西班牙口音的言語—任何人，走到那裹一定會看見拉米立斯的律師招牌的。那就是他的老母和那當地敎師的惟一指望，可以替他們爭一口氣的。那塊招牌在那裹掛了一些時，但是以後就不知去何了。</p>
<p>簡單的說來，事情是這樣的。照著公理而論，墨西哥部的強尼拉米立斯承辦的案件，是萬無一失的。一位女郎頭髪還是半夜的裝束，臉上塗著脂粉，打扮得嬌艷欲滴帶著一個男友，來到這骯髒的地帶，實鑒賞鑒這異族人聚族而居的風光。他的威猛大汽車，在一段路的當中，突然旋轉過來，齊巧有一個老農民的運菜的汽車走過，擱腰衝了上去，將那輛破舊的車子，衝得粉碎，萊蔬滾得滿地。那輛破舊的汽車，就是那老農一家生活的依靠。現在呌他怎樣運輸他的貨品，來往於鎮上和鄉間呢？他呆呆地站在路旁，不覺老涙縱橫起來。他手裹拿著一張卡片。照著那女郎的男伴，他還叫她不要給他那張卡片哩。總算那女郎還算有些良心，給了他那張卡片。</p>
<p>過了一天，大家都到了法庭裹，那女郎態度安詳，衣著入時。她的男友亦在法庭，他是一位著名的律師。那個販菜蔬的農民，露著頹敗卑微的神氣。他惟一的希望，就在強尼拉米立斯身上。強尼亦在法庭之中。他穿著一身油光氣的藍嗶嘰衣服，站在審判官的面前，他的黑髪是散亂的。她說話時頻頻揮著他的臂。他因爲心中的憤激，不覺熱汁涔涔而下。</p>
<p>但是在普拉薩禮拜堂內，拉米立斯的老母卻跪在聖母神像前聽告著：「求我慈悲聖母，使我的兒子能贏得這個案件，祇這一次。我已再三求告，祇須贏這一次—不然他要心碎了。求慈悲的瑪利……幫助他……我並不要皮大衣……我但求但能贏這個案件……」（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Regarding Construction and Pacification: Defining Central Tasks <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, Order Three Provinces to Strangle and Suppress Military Officers: Set a Deadline to Eliminate Remnant Bandits in Border Areas; Otherwise, They Will Be Deemed as Harboring Bandits and Disobeying Orders</p>
<p>[Nanchang] Chairman Chiang, on the 15th, telegraphed Zhang, Acting Commander of Hubei; Director He; Chairman Zhang of Hunan; Chairman Liu of Henan; Chairman Liu of Anhui; Director Gu of Jiangxi; Chairman Xiong; Director Chiang of Zhangzhou; and Chairman Chen of Fujian, stating that each province should henceforth define its central tasks for construction and pacification. The original telegram read: "Upon investigation, the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian have long suffered from banditry. They have just been pacified, leaving the local areas devastated and full of wounds. The most urgent task in the aftermath is to strive for construction to achieve recovery, to implement thorough pacification to eliminate remnants, and especially to ensure military and political cooperation, with the army and civilians working together to quickly promote the practical effects of construction and pacification. Starting from March this year, the pacification commanders and administrative commissioners of each district should jointly select one or two construction projects and central tasks in pacification to focus on with utmost concentration and collective effort. Each period should be three months. Each period must be carried out in accordance with its predetermined plan. The central tasks for the first period must be completed by the end of May this year. The implementation methods of the selected tasks should be submitted through each pacification headquarters and provincial government to the General Headquarters for record. Provinces without a pacification district commander should have the local stationed army commander or division commander cooperate with the administrative commissioner of the district to handle matters in accordance with the above regulations. The stationed troops in the district should provide as much assistance as possible for this task. When this chairman arrives in the area for inspection, the effectiveness will be used as a basis for performance evaluation. The central tasks for the second period may continue unfinished projects from the first period or be stipulated separately, and must also be reported at the same time. It is hoped that the corresponding pacification zone commanders or unit officers and administrative commissioners will be instructed to strictly comply with these requirements." (Deleted by Zhongzheng, Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Nanchang] Chairman Chiang, on the 15th, telegraphed Zhang Xueliang and the general commanders and division commanders in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, setting a deadline of April this year to eliminate the remnant bandits in the border areas; otherwise, they will be charged with harboring bandits and disobeying orders. The original telegram read: "Upon investigation, the remnant bandits in the border areas have been repeatedly attacked and their nests destroyed. They are already in dire straits and unable to do anything. However, the bandit suppression troops in the border areas, although having formed a long-standing encirclement, have not achieved complete annihilation. For two years, the bandit gangs have been able to survive and arbitrarily roam around. This is not because the remnant bandits are particularly cunning, but because our bandit suppression troops are slow to act and ineffective in pursuing and suppressing them. It is a waste of resources and money, harmful to the local areas, and a failure to protect the country and its people. Speaking of this, I feel deeply saddened. From now on, the Liang General Commander, the Liu Army Commander, and the He Army Commander should be separately responsible for supervising and intensifying the suppression efforts. Before April this year, all important bandit leaders in the border areas must be captured or killed. Otherwise, the general commanders, army commanders, and officers of the subordinate units will be held responsible and charged with harboring bandits and disobeying orders. All should comply strictly and not be negligent again." (Deleted by Zhongzheng, Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>[Nanchang] The Provincial Cooperation Association, to honor merit and repay virtue, specially prepared commemorative gifts to respectfully present to Chairman Chiang: a red satin banner, a large silver cauldron, and a congratulatory scroll. All the committee members presented them to Chairman Chiang. The congratulatory words read: "The Red Bandits' calamity in Jiangxi shook the world. Chairman, you were enraged and expeditiously marched, saving the people from fire and water, cutting through thorns and brambles, annihilating the great bandits, and recovering famous cities. The city dust is settled, and your authority and virtue are manifest. Jackals and wolves flee far away, and farming and weaving bring tranquility. As the Book of Changes says, 'Offerings bring blessings, and benevolence spreads with meritorious inscriptions.' Celebrating the triumphant return, we respectfully express our sincere heart."

<h3 id="e3">The Japanese-Puppet Side Expedites Construction of Two Roads Outside the Pass <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Tianjin] The puppet regime allocated 1,200,000 yuan to build the roads from Chengde to Shanhaiguan and from Chengde to Gubeikou. Construction has not started because enough workers have not been recruited. Both roads are entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway Company by the puppet Ministry of Transportation to build. The routes connecting Chengde to Gubeikou, Chengde to Xifengkou, and Chengde to Lengkou are each constructing a highway about two zhang wide for automobile traffic. The surveying has been completed. The puppet government stipulates discounts for the price of the occupied land for each road. When the two roads are completed, they will connect with the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Road, making military transportation more convenient. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Shandaitong Company in Shanhaiguan specializes in selling puppet entry permits. Recently, entrusted by the Japanese and puppet authorities, it is recruiting laborers in the pass and transporting them outside the pass to build roads. The company has branches in Dalian, Yingkou, Changchun, Shenyang, Gubeikou, and Xifengkou, and has a four-part organization with free lodging, job placement, career guidance, and disease relief. The recruited laborers are all recruited by the company. However, although there are such organizations, they are actually false to strengthen people's trust. Once they enter the puppet territory, all organizations become surveillance agencies, forcing work and not paying a penny. The authorities of Hebei have issued a circular to all subordinates, dissuading laborers from being deceived. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Dalian] The Chinese steamer Xinhua, carrying 230 Chinese coolies, was refused entry because they did not have entry permits. Among them, 158 people actually boarded five sampans and landed privately today. After being discovered on the spot, orders have been issued to search strictly. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>[Tianjin] The Huludao project has completed the first, second, and third phases of construction. The Japanese side has scheduled the fourth phase of construction to begin in April, first building wharves number seven and eight, the Japanese naval headquarters, and the Japanese naval barracks, adding railway tracks, and building the dock for the warship Leixingzhuang in north Huludao. The fifth and sixth phases of construction will be carried out around July and August, focusing on tidying up municipal affairs. Currently, three Japanese warships are docked in the port to protect the ships. Japanese ships enter the port daily to load and unload goods. The amount of goods imported and exported through the puppet Fengshan Road is extremely large. There are already 300 shops, a population of over 40,000, and the industry is becoming increasingly prosperous. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Yi Wo Visits Yu Xuezhong to Discuss War Zone Issues <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>New Peace Preservation Corps Enters War Zone: Number of Personnel and Equipment Largely Determined</p>
<p>Two District Commanders Have Been Appointed: Zhang Yantian and Zhang Qingyu</p>
<p>[Beiping] Yi Wo, accompanied by Tao Shangming, visited Yu Xuezhong at 9:00 AM this morning to discuss issues related to the war zone. Regarding the entry of the newly formed Peace Preservation Corps into the war zone, it was decided to maintain the quota of 5,000 personnel. In addition to carrying rifles, they will be allowed to carry 50 light machine guns to suppress banditry. Yi Wo stated that the number of light machine guns carried by the new Peace Preservation Corps should be inspected by the Japanese side at any time. Yu replied that constant inspection seemed too trivial and that it would be simpler to inspect when the new Peace Preservation Corps entered the war zone. The Japanese side has agreed. It is also heard that Yi Wo was very cheerful during the meeting. Yi Wo stated that if the Peace Preservation Corps needed artillery to suppress bandits, they could contact the Japanese side at any time to transport it for use, but it must be returned immediately after use. Yu also expressed satisfaction. The conversation ended at 10:30 AM. Yu told reporters that the date of entry of the new Peace Preservation Corps into the war zone has not been decided yet. The quota is 5,000 personnel, and the deployment of garrison locations will be based on the needs of the situation. Areas where the situation is stable may not need to be stationed. Areas where banditry has not subsided will naturally have a larger garrison. The two district commanders have been appointed as Zhang Yantian and Zhang Qingyu. Zhang Yantian will be stationed in the Luan-Yu district, and Zhang Qingyu will be stationed in the Ji-Mi district. As for the original Peace Preservation Corps, those with better discipline will be transferred to Tongxian. Feng Shoupeng's troops will be transferred to Kaiping and handed over to Zhao Lei for reorganization. Yi Wo left Beiping for Tianjin this afternoon. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Since the resolution of the Chahar issue, the Japanese attitude towards North China diplomacy has gradually become more moderate than before. North China diplomacy is aimed at the central diplomatic policy, so it can be asserted that relations between the two sides will improve in the near future. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Yu Xuezhong stated that the Yellow River breach blocking project in southern Hebei is being supervised on-site by Hu Yuanhui. The initial allocation of 200,000 yuan for the breach blocking project has been used up, and another 60,000 yuan has been allocated by the provincial government for use. The provincial government's move to Baoding will begin preparations next month. There are still insufficient houses for the government offices. The General Headquarters has agreed to find a way to vacate a part of the building. Banditry in Hebei Province has been quite successful after being suppressed by the stationed troops in various places. It is expected that it can be completely eliminated within this year. Regarding the sealing of Ji Hongchang's and Ren Yingqi's properties, the Hebei provincial government has not yet received instructions. To his personal knowledge, Ji and Ren have no property in Tianjin. He himself will not stay in Beiping for long and will report the recent military and political situation in Hebei Province to He this afternoon and return to Tianjin within days. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After the reorganization of the Yutian Peace Preservation Corps, it is planned to transfer them to Haiyangzhen, Kaiping, and Qinhuangdao. It will be implemented when the Qingwei meeting resolves the measures. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Special Police Corps of Hebei will move east and be realized at the beginning of next month. The newly formed Special Police Corps of Zhang Yantian and Zhang Qingyu, stationed in Cangzhou, Jinghai, and Yangcun, will each be reduced to 2,500 personnel and renamed the Peace Preservation Corps. After moving east, the old Peace Preservation Corps of Fan Jinghe, Zhou Yuying, and Yang Yucheng will be replaced. They are allowed to carry 50 light machine guns. If necessary, with the consent of the Japanese side, heavy weapons can also be used. The maximum caliber of the field guns is 3.5. The Peace Preservation Corps of Zhao Lei and Liu Zuo Zhou will each be reduced to 1,500 personnel, and Sun Jizhou's troops will be reduced to 1,000 personnel, all called the Special Police Corps. The two types of Peace Preservation Corps and Special Police Corps have a total of 9,000 personnel, which conforms to the number agreed in the Tanggu Agreement. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Yi Wo came to Tianjin from Beiping this afternoon and plans to return to Yuguan by night train. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Feng Shoupeng's troops of the Yutian Peace Preservation Corps fought fiercely with more than 100 members of the Red Spear Society in Beisongzhuang for 8 hours, from 3:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the 13th. The Society members were unable to hold out and abandoned 32 corpses and fled into Yunshan Mountain. All the villages in the seventh district were looted by the Society members. The Red Spear Society members who infiltrated the seventh and eighth districts of Yutian County came from outside the pass. Initially, there were only 30 to 40 people. Later, they incited the ignorant people in Miaofeng Temple and expanded to more than 100 people. The Society's senior brother, Li, and second senior brother, Zhang, are both from Rehe. On the 12th, they once occupied Beisongzhuang and abducted 27 wealthy households such as Li Jiulong, and seized dozens of guns from the local defense forces and police stations. The bandits now have sharp weapons, so they are resisting stubbornly. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The counties in the eastern and northern war zones of Hebei have been peaceful for the past month. Yutian only had a conflict in Linnancang two months ago, and it has been peaceful for the past two months. He Xiaoyi, the magistrate of Zunhua County, came to Beiping yesterday to meet with Yin Rugeng and report on everything, and he will return to his post in three or four days. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] After repeated consultations between China and Japan, the issue of the new Peace Preservation Corps entering the war zone has been largely decided. The number of personnel is 5,000. In addition to one gun per person, they will also carry 50 light machine guns. The Japanese side has also agreed that if they encounter a large number of bandits, they can temporarily add artillery and guns to suppress them, but they must be withdrawn afterwards. Preparations are currently underway, and they will enter the war zone after everything is ready. The new Peace Preservation Corps is divided into two brigades, led by Zhang Yantian and Zhang Qingyu. Zhang Yantian's troops will be stationed in the Luan-Yu district, and Zhang Qingyu's troops will be stationed in the Ji-Mi district. The details of the defense of the mines still need to be discussed. The original Peace Preservation Corps stationed in the war zone will select the better ones and transfer them to Tongzhou. The rest, such as Feng Shoupeng's troops, will be transferred to Kaiping for separate training. Whether to appoint a general commander or be commanded by the commissioner will be decided after entering the war zone, depending on the actual needs. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan ordered all provinces and cities that they should protect sound speech on one hand, and must not abuse their powers. The matters of censorship and prohibition should be strictly followed by laws and regulations, and not overstep. On the other hand, they should also earnestly inform local speech organizations, so that they can restrain themselves, encourage adherence to journalistic ethics, and not abuse the power of newspapers to harm the interests of the country and others, so that the national news industry can enter the right track, enhance the effectiveness of public opinion, and establish the foundation of the rule of law. All depend on this. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Legislative Yuan Passes the Army, Navy, and Air Force Disciplinary Regulations <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Passes the Draft Law on the Organization of the Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications; Amends Two Articles of the Organization Law of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau; Rejects the Explanation of Legal Cases by the Judicial Yuan</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan convened a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 15th, with 74 members present, including Lian Shenghai and Zhao Maohua. Sun Ke presided over the meeting, and Liang Han Cao was the secretary-general. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) Review and revise the articles of the Organization Law of the Salt Administration Reform Committee, decided to submit to the Legal System and Finance Committees for review. (2) Review and revise Articles 17, 20, 21, and 22 of the Organization Law of the Ministry of Education, decided to submit to the Legal System Committee for review. (3) The Military and Legal System Committees reported on the review of the draft Disciplinary Regulations for the Army, Navy, and Air Force, decided to revise and pass. (4) The Legal System Committee reported on the review of the draft Organization Law of the Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, decided to revise and pass. (5) The Legal System and Economic Committees reported on the review of the revision of Articles 4 and 6 of the Organization Law of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, decided to pass according to the review report. According to the review results, Article 4 was changed to the bureau will have six divisions: General Affairs, Business, Accounting, Savings, Remittances, and Insurance. Each division will have a director and deputy director, selected by the director of the bureau from specialized personnel and submitted for appointment. Article 6 was changed to the bureau will have 60 to 100 staff members, submitted by the director of the bureau for appointment from specialized personnel who have passed the screening examination. As for the Legal System and Economic Committees' proposal to the Yuan Conference that all requests to the Yuan for the interpretation of legal cases should be interpreted by the Judicial Yuan according to law, after fierce debate among the members, it was finally rejected. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan passed the amended Army, Navy, and Air Force Disciplinary Law at the General Assembly on the 15th. All 24 articles stipulate that the misconduct of personnel of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and military dependents, which does not involve the scope of criminal law, shall be punished according to this law, unless otherwise stipulated by law. The types of punishment for officers and warrant officers are removal from office, suspension, demerit, salary deduction, confinement, and sincere repentance; for soldiers, they are demotion, confinement, labor service, house arrest, reprimand. There are 26 items of punishable misconduct, including undermining military discipline, losing military reputation, forming private groups, shirking responsibility and claiming credit, using excuses to coerce, overstepping authority, and improper handling. The powers of punishment exercised by leaders at all levels over their subordinates are specified in detail. However, the punishment of officers and warrant officers above the rank of major general shall be submitted to the highest military authority for approval. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] When the Legislative Yuan discussed the legal cases proposed by the Legal System and Economic Committees in the morning of the 15th, which should be interpreted by the Judicial Yuan, Jiao Yitang first explained the process of the proposal. The case was submitted by the Ministry of Industry to the Executive Yuan in 1931 and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for interpretation. Article 10, Section 9, of the Ministry's Organization Law, whether the so-called special business includes savings associations. The Yuan Conference handed it over to the Legal System and Economic Committees for review. The two committees therefore raised the issue of the jurisdiction of legal interpretation, and the dispute was quite fierce. Some argued that according to Article 3 of the Judicial Yuan's Organization Law, the president of the Yuan, after deliberation by the president of the Supreme Court and the presidents of the subordinate courts, exercises the power to uniformly interpret laws and change precedents. The power of legal interpretation belongs to the judiciary, which is beyond doubt. If the Legislative Yuan also interprets laws, it not only hinders the uniformity of the power of interpretation, but also has the drawback of one law having two interpretations. Therefore, they supported the original proposal that the power of legal interpretation should belong to the judiciary. Some argued that the Legislative Yuan has interpreted laws in the first, second, and third sessions, which has become a convention. Moreover, the judicial interpretation of laws is limited to civil and criminal laws, and the interpretation of regulations on people's organizations and administrative regulations has always been done by the Legislative Yuan. The fourth session suddenly changed course, and the reasons were not appropriate. They opposed the original proposal and advocated waiting for the constitutional period before unifying the power of legal interpretation according to the provisions of the constitution. There were also proposals for compromise, advocating that judicial interpretation should still be handled by the Judicial Yuan, and legislative interpretation should be the responsibility of the Legislative Yuan. There were even those who advocated submitting the case for review. As a result, the chairman announced the vote. The case was rejected because the number of supporters was small, and it could not be established. As for the interpretation of the Organization Law of the Ministry of Industry, it was still handed over to the Legal System and Economic Committees for handling and reporting. The revised Organization Law of the Maritime Administration Bureau was also passed, and the Ministry of Communications also requested four amendments: (1) Regarding the handling of ship collision disputes, (2) Regarding the establishment of secretaries and inspectors. The legislators believed that the first point should be stipulated in the Maritime Dispute Handling Regulations, and the second point, the establishment of inspectors, may not be helpful. Moreover, not setting up secretaries has become a convention, and it does not seem necessary to amend it. (3) Regarding the qualifications for the appointment of maritime personnel, the Ministry of Communications' opinions were increased. (4) Regarding the establishment of offices, it was determined that they could be established in important seaports and commercial ports. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Another Method for Promoting the New Life Movement <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>According to yesterday's newspaper report, Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, donated a large sum of money to the Bible Society in this city, in accordance with President Chiang's promotion of the New Life Movement, so that it could reprint the Bible and spread it widely, in order to promote the practical effectiveness of the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement, since its inception by President Chiang, has been a year in the making. In this year, all parties have made sincere efforts to promote it, but in terms of effectiveness, it cannot but be said that it is still limited. China's national power has declined to the extreme today. Analyzing the reasons, the disloyalty of outsiders accounts for a small part, but the root causes of its own diseases account for the greater part. Zeng Guofan said, "The lack of soldiers is not enough to cry about, the lack of pay is not enough to worry deeply, only the inability to find someone who does not rush to seek profit before fulfilling righteousness is a cause for deep lament." This statement can be said to be on point. "People must insult themselves before others insult them. A country must attack itself before others attack it." If it does not first have its own way of decline and ruin, then what is there to fear even with foreign enemies? Therefore, if we want to save China from danger and ruin today, we can only start by curing the root causes of the disease. President Chiang promoted the New Life Movement and specifically revealed the four virtues of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" as an advocacy for the people of the country. His motivation was not to be found in this. However, the reason why the results have not been great in the past year, despite the many efforts, is that the promotion of the New Life Movement in the past has purely started from the moral aspect. Morality is a major force governing life. This is something that no one can deny. However, morality is the fine words and deeds left to us by the ancient sages. Whether we can practice these fine words and deeds depends entirely on individual willpower. This is what makes it so difficult. Confucius once said, "At fifteen, I set my heart on learning; at thirty, I stood firm... At seventy, I could follow my heart's desire without transgressing the bounds of propriety." Even with the utmost holiness of Confucius, it still took fifty-five years of continuous effort to reach the point of "following my heart's desire without transgressing the bounds of propriety." It is thus evident how difficult it is for others to succeed. The moral precepts, whether practiced or not, are purely based on individual willingness. If one is unwilling, then the precepts are the precepts, and life is life. As for religion, it takes faith in a supernatural personality as a condition. Therefore, with faith, the moral precepts are not difficult to put into practice. As it is said, "as if He is above, as if He is on the left and right," even the common man and woman can do it. This is why the ancients had the saying of establishing teachings through divine ways. Now that Madam Chiang has seen this, it can truly open a new chapter for the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Although Christianity has been in China for a long time, in the past, scholars and officials were less inclined to speak of it. In fact, the teachings of Christianity can be said to be a targeted medicine for today's widespread folk customs. There is a deep and urgent need for it. The Christian view of life is a non-individualistic and altruistic one. Because it does not take the individual as the center, it can encourage people to sacrifice themselves. Because it can sacrifice itself, it has the spirit of giving up one's life for righteousness. If the people of a country can mostly give up their lives for righteousness, I ask, would the country not become strong and prosperous as a result? Furthermore, the Christian view of life is both positive and negative. Because it is positive, it is a religion of this world. Because it is negative, it can encourage people not to strive for material things. To put it another way, the strength of Christianity lies in helping others. It always encourages people to provide positive assistance, but when they gain, it always advises people to yield. Therefore, its teachings neither deny material life nor affirm spiritual life at the same time. Because of this, it is clearly different from religions that escape the world. The greatest problems in our country today lie in the individualistic and materialistic views of life. Both of these lead people to selfishness and self-interest, from which they cannot recover. The reason why the nation has become a sheet of loose sand and the country's labor is becoming increasingly critical is that these two views of life are at work, and it is obvious that words of morality alone are not enough to save the day. Therefore, arousing people's religious beliefs to examine and restrain their bodies and minds is also a way to correct customs.</p>

<p>Aimed at Striking Outer Mongolia to the North and Invading Our Northwest to the South; The Puppet State Sets Up a Mongolian Affairs Department and Includes Inner Mongolia Under Its Jurisdiction</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Pravda commented on the Chahar incident, "The Japanese warlords have long been paying attention to Chahar Province, Inner Mongolia, and the northwestern provinces of China. In Chahar, there are now a large number of highways, desert roads, and other roads leading directly to the Mongolian People's Republic. The Japanese warlords will use Chahar Province as a base for military operations, striking the Mongolian People's Republic to the north and invading the northwestern provinces of China to the south. At this time, we must point out that the 'Manchukuo' government has recently established the so-called Mongolian Affairs Department, and the vast area of Inner Mongolia has been included in the 'jurisdiction' of this department. At the same time, the department plans to annex northern Chahar into the 'Manchukuo' territory. The Chahar incident was caused by the mutiny of Japanese officers. This incident has shown that the Japanese warlords are determined to complete their plan to seize Chinese territory and turn Manchuria and North China into a training ground for future wars."

<p>[Washington] Officials claimed today that although the quota for American oil imports into "Manchukuo" is higher than originally hoped, the officials are still dissatisfied. The United States' view is that although foreigners may be treated preferentially after the implementation of the monopoly, it must not make the monopoly reasonable. Regarding the oil issue, the United States has formally protested to Japan. Japan has disclaimed responsibility and said that it must negotiate directly with "Manchukuo." However, "Manchukuo" has now revised its measures, that is, the monopoly system will still be implemented as originally planned, and sales will be handled by foreign companies. After this method is implemented, the United States may regard the matter as closed. (National News dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e13">A Glimmer of Hope for Peace in Europe: Germany Endorses Air Defense Pact <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Friendly Tone in Reply to British and French Governments, Reservations on Central and Eastern European Pact</p>
<p>[Geneva] World peace gained two major victories today. Germany has announced its complete acceptance of the terms of the British and French air defense plan. The League of Nations has also adopted the American proposal as the basis for future disarmament discussions. News from Rome and Berlin also indicates that Germany's response to the air pact expresses sympathy for the Italian-French agreement on non-interference in Austria. Only one matter seems less than perfect: Germany believes that Austria should be free to choose its own form of government, whether National Socialist or a restored monarchy. As for the Eastern Locarno Pact, Germany states that if its principles are based on military mutual assistance, then Germany opposes it. However, government authorities have already clarified that this pact is not a military alliance but a non-aggression agreement. It is noted that the German government's acceptance of the British and French air defense agreement was generally expected. It is reported that German Foreign Minister Neurath's reply to the British and French governments also stated that Germany is willing to discuss general disarmament issues. Semi-official sources say that the tone of the reply is very friendly and particularly satisfied with the cancellation of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. As for the League of Nations, the arms committee meeting here has passed the plan proposed by American representative Wilson to reopen the disarmament conference. Wilson had previously expressed that the United States strongly supports the British and French agreement. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Main Points of German Reply <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Oral Explanation by Neurath</p>
<p>[Berlin] Germany's response to the proposals in the British-French declaration of February 3rd was delivered this evening by Foreign Minister Neurath to the British and French ambassadors to Germany. The French ambassador, Poncet, immediately sent a translation to Paris. The reply was typed and consists of two pages, to be published in the newspapers on Saturday morning. It is said that the content is quite general in nature and expresses agreement, advocating the commencement of diplomatic talks to discuss the various proposals of the British and French governments. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the content of the German reply, very little is known here as of tonight. When German Foreign Minister Neurath delivered the reply to the British and French ambassadors, he attached an oral explanation, the content of which is also difficult to ascertain. According to initial reports, the tone of the reply is very moderate but deliberately vague, stating that Germany has good intentions and is willing to cooperate with all countries to achieve peace. Of the various proposals in the British-French declaration, Germany pays the most attention to the air pact. Germany has expressed acceptance of the principles and basis of the pact. As for the Danube Pact and the Eastern European mutual assistance pact plan, the reply does not seem to mention them. According to the British-French declaration, these two pacts must be implemented simultaneously before Germany's right to equal armament can be recognized and a general arms limitation treaty can be concluded to replace the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. On this point, the German reply seems very ambiguous. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Further details about the content of the German reply have been learned, which can be added to the above. Germany did not raise any questions about the British and French proposals but stated that the air pact proposal assumes that Germany is in an equal position in terms of armaments, which Germany has been constantly demanding. Now that the British and French governments have proposed concluding this pact, it is tantamount to tacitly acknowledging this right of equality. Regarding the draft Danube Pact, the German government generally believes that there is no need to restate its views in detail, so it only mentioned it in general terms in the reply. As for the Eastern European mutual assistance pact plan, its attitude is not as negative as the official newspapers have expressed, which is unexpected by most people. However, the German government believes that the issue of security can raise many problems, so it adopts a reserved attitude to avoid being constrained, but it does not refuse to jointly study the matter with the governments of the countries concerned. (14th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Geneva] It is reported that Germany's reply to the air defense agreement stated that it is willing to entrust the German Air Force to the signatory countries of the air defense treaty for any joint action. Reliable sources explain that Germany has made this statement because the London agreement assumed that Germany already has this air force, but it cannot be regarded as Germany acknowledging that it has exceeded the scope stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] French Foreign Minister Laval studied the German reply immediately after receiving it. The reply was forwarded to France by the French ambassador to Germany. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to an article published in the Diplomatic Review, semi-official sources stated that the government's declaration is not surprising, as Germany has been striving to avoid any arms race and prevent the brewing of war in recent months. As for the document sent by Foreign Minister Neurath to the British and French ambassadors yesterday, the British communication contained only constructive elements, so there was no need to express acceptance or rejection. Furthermore, Germany is already negotiating on the security issues of Eastern and Southern Europe. Germany insists on exchanging views to resolve all difficulties. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Disarmament Committee Meeting <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Discussion of American Proposal</p>
<p>[Geneva] At today's meeting of the Disarmament Conference Committee to discuss the American draft convention on the suppression of arms trade and manufacturing, British representative Sir Stanhope expressed criticism of the American proposal to establish a permanent committee under the League of Nations to control arms trade and manufacturing, saying that it was too complicated and difficult to implement. The League's task is to enable countries to submit detailed reports on arms trade and manufacturing, not to monitor the number of guns and cannons manufactured. Therefore, the British government proposed that the League should make necessary inquiries and advocated adding a clause containing the principle that it is inconvenient to implement an export license system for arms trade, as this system would encourage countries to abuse funds on armaments. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The situation at today's meeting of the Disarmament Conference Committee on the Suppression of Arms Manufacturing and Trafficking, regarding the draft convention proposed by the United States, was better than yesterday. The representatives of various countries did not criticize the basic content of this proposal, and the representatives of Soviet Russia, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Canada expressed their approval. Soviet Russian representative Antodorov believed that the American proposal allowed private manufacturing of arms, which was too broad in scope and inappropriate. He said that only Soviet Russia in the world can eliminate the evils of private arms manufacturing, because Russian arms manufacturing is entirely state-owned. However, although state-owned arms manufacturing is necessary, it cannot be implemented temporarily except for Soviet Russia. Therefore, the American proposal can be regarded as a reasonable compromise. American representative Wilson, the minister to Switzerland, stood up to thank everyone and reserved the right to reply to the various objections raised on the details. In addition, there is hope that the reservations raised by the British and Italian governments at yesterday's meeting will also be reduced. (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e16">French Foreign Minister Laval Promotes Eastern European Pact <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Three Meetings with Russian Ambassador</p>
<p>Guarantees "Diplomatic Check" Will Be Cashed</p>
<p>[Paris] Today, French Foreign Minister Laval spoke with Soviet Russian Ambassador Potemkin again. This is the third meeting in recent days, so it has attracted considerable attention from the outside world. It is generally believed that this is a resolute expression of Soviet Russian diplomatic policy, the purpose of which is to make France cash the "diplomatic check" issued by former Foreign Minister Barthou. As far as the outside world knows, what Soviet Russia requires is that France should adhere to a firm policy, so that when the negotiations on the Eastern European Pact fail on a broad basis, France's diplomatic policy will not waver. When Laval was previously in Geneva, he accepted the demands of the Little Entente countries and Soviet Russia. Since then, all actions have taken the negotiations on the Eastern European Pact as a prerequisite. Before the Eastern European Pact is established, no negotiations will be conducted with Germany. It is generally believed that he has reiterated his previous remarks in his recent talks with Potemkin. However, the official news released by the authorities is evasive on this point, only stating that Potemkin has been given the necessary repeated assurances and explanations.

It will be implemented simultaneously once the Saar returns to Germany. Recently, Göring has toured the provinces of Trieste and Bremen, and will soon go to the provinces of Bavaria and Württemberg, which shows that his political position is becoming increasingly important.

<p>Former Air Force Commander Advocates Airship Policy</p>
<p>[Washington] Amid the enthusiastic expectations of the Big Navy and Continental Army factions, Congress, under the leadership of President Roosevelt, has fully agreed to the $2,000,000,000 national defense plan. This plan aims to make America's skies safe, protect America's coasts from enemy invasion, mechanize America's army, increase the number of servicemen, and bring America's naval power to treaty limits. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Former U.S. Air Force Commander Major General Mitchell declared today that America's abandonment of the airship policy is a symbol of spiritual degeneration. Mitchell told the House Licenses Committee today that the United States should continue to build large airships and make them the mainstay of American national defense. If we had fifty well-equipped Zeppelins, we could reach any country in Asia and destroy it. Mitchell has been very enthusiastic about all U.S. air defense matters since he was the commander of the U.S. Air Force stationed in France. Mitchell said that flying the Macon and other large airships over the fleet was a big mistake made by the Navy. To prevent airship accidents, the only way is to avoid storms and adverse weather conditions. The Macon had passed through storms twice before the accident, so its effectiveness was greatly reduced. Mitchell severely criticized the Navy for failing to have trained personnel to fly the Macon, and said that piloting large airships is as difficult as piloting ordinary ships, and the Navy should be aware of this. Large airships are ideal aircraft carriers, but they can also be used as offensive weapons, so they are even more valuable. I believe the United States should send young officers to the Zeppelin Company for training. Mitchell also suggested subsidizing the Goodyear Zeppelin Company, which built the Macon and Akron, to develop its business. (14th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Probably Due to Weak Tail Structure</p>
<p>[Binghamton] The U.S. Navy Investigation Committee began investigating the cause of the U.S. Navy airship Macon disaster today. Commander Wund declared that when the Macon was flying off Point Sur at a speed of 63 knots at an altitude of 1,250 feet, he ordered the rudder to turn left, but shortly after, the whole ship shook, followed by an explosion. Before the accident, the ship was traveling through thick clouds, with rain below the clouds, and the ship was quite disturbed, so it descended from an altitude of 2,700 feet to 1,700 feet. The tail was damaged, and the ship crashed into the sea. He could not determine the cause of the tail gas balloon's damage. President Roosevelt stated today that there are no immediate plans to rebuild the airship. It is generally speculated that the Macon disaster was probably due to the weak tail structure.

<p>Djibouti Port Controls the Vital Eurasian Transportation Route; Any Troops Passing Through Must Disarm; Italian Army Prepares to Depart; Ethiopian Government Lodges Protest</p>
<p>[Paris] With the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia, the French government has ordered the adoption of necessary precautions to avoid regrettable outcomes. The Djibouti port in French Somaliland, a vital transportation route from Europe to the Far East, is of great importance. Sufficient troops and military equipment have now been deployed there. If local tribes seek to pass through French territory for fear of conquest by Italian or Ethiopian forces, they will all be disarmed. Since the assassination of French Somaliland Administrator Bernard and his subordinates by natives last month, troops have been increased in the 22,000 square kilometers of French territory and strategic points have been controlled. The French government has requested an apology, compensation, and the pacification of the Ethiopian border from the Ethiopian government regarding this case. The Ethiopian government has given favorable consideration to these requests. The Ethiopian government has expressed its willingness to take responsibility for the previous incident and proposed that representatives from France and Ethiopia jointly discuss border pacification measures.

<p>[Rome] The shipment of the two divisions mobilized recently for the African affair began in small batches today from various ports in southern Italy. These troops are mostly technical soldiers whose mission is to transport military supplies and war materials to Eritrea and Somaliland. According to related sources, the deployment of the main force is only intended to strengthen the strength of the existing Italian garrison on the Ethiopian border, so that it can have considerable resistance in the event of another attack by rioters, and there is no intention of invading Ethiopia. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The Ethiopian Legation in London issued a communiqué stating, "The Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs hereby declares that" since the Walwal incident in early December last year, "Ethiopia has never concentrated troops on the border of the Italian East African colony and has ordered outpost soldiers to avoid incidents and not to move. This order has been respectfully carried out by these soldiers. Until January 29, when Italian troops again attacked near the Gero Gebi area, the Ethiopian government reiterated its previous order, considering it a way to calm the situation. In Italy, after this offensive, it was announced that Afdubob, after Walwal, had been occupied by Italian troops. It should be noted that Ethiopia has never threatened the safety of Italian Somaliland. The Italian government's claim that Ethiopia has taken military measures, thus mobilizing two divisions, is unfounded. At a time when Italy and Ethiopia are conducting negotiations to form a committee to undertake reconciliation and arbitration, Italy's mobilization of two divisions runs counter to maintaining mutual trust, so that negotiations can be successfully completed."

<p>Rumors of Cabinet Split Disappear</p>
<p>Unemployment Relief Bill Passes Both Houses</p>
<p>Labour Party's Motion of Impeachment Ultimately Defeated</p>
<p>[London] It is generally felt that yesterday's debate in the House of Commons has clarified the atmosphere. The remarks of Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain are particularly able to dispel the Conservative Party's split, reverse pessimism, and dispel speculation about a general election in the autumn. Dominion Minister Thomas gave a speech in London, firmly refuting the rumors of a government split and a general election soon to be held, saying that such rumors only cause disturbance and harm the people. Churchill declared inside and outside the House of Commons that his opposition to the government's Indian Bill was not due to any hostility towards the current government's organizational system, and he did not want to cause the Conservative Party to split. The Times said today that recent events have postponed the date of the general election, but it feels that there is still a need for a government reshuffle. The Manchester Guardian reported that Prime Minister MacDonald is gradually becoming the only public enemy of the cabinet, and the longer he remains at the helm, the heavier the cabinet will fall. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The government's Unemployment Prevention Bill, after being passed by the House of Commons in the second reading, was passed by the House of Lords today. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Labour Party leader Lansbury moved a motion of impeachment against the government, accusing the government of failing to define any policy for the growing number of unemployed, and of deceiving Parliament on the financial impact of the regulations for maintaining the livelihood relief of the unemployed, thus losing the trust of the country. Lansbury said that what the Labour Party impeaches the government for is its inability to fulfill its duties. Everything that has happened has been foreseen by Labour Party members. Lansbury then attacked the household living test, calling it cruel and unparalleled. At this point, Dominion Minister Thomas intervened, saying that it was useless for Lansbury to compare today's test with the original method passed by the previous Labour government (of which Lansbury was also a member). Lansbury then said that unless the relief funds given to the unemployed are based on the best wage standards so that they can support themselves and their wives and children, the problem of unemployment will never be properly resolved. The leader of the "Samuel Liberal Party," Samuel, agreed that the government should be impeached, but said that all the mistakes that have occurred are due to the bureaucracy and serve as a warning to the Socialist Party in power. Then, female member Astor rose to speak, praising and criticizing both sides, and ultimately concluded that the Labour Party's policy was unworkable, advising the government not to surrender to this ragged army, witty remarks, and those who heard it laughed a lot. Finally, Prime Minister MacDonald rose to say that the emotions expressed by Lansbury were shared by all parties. He often believed that society must progress according to the law of evolution and cannot forcibly implement foreign revolutionary methods. If the opposition party can abandon criticism and cooperate with the government to find effective ways to deal with this problem, it would be of greater benefit. The government is willing to accept any truly constructive suggestions put forward by any party. The government is determined to return the unemployed to industry and become free and independent workers. Although he does not want to underestimate the importance of this issue, the national situation has indeed been improving recently. In recent days, there have been attempts to disturb people's minds and spread various rumors, indicating that the government is about to step down, which is actually for other purposes. The Prime Minister then cited a trade report stating that Britain's exports in January increased by more than 12%, and the steel industry in 1934 was better than it had been since 1930, saying that these were all good signs. The government's entire policy, especially its financial policy, has won the trust of the industrial world, which has led to new plans, the result of which has enabled a large number of unemployed to find work. When the Prime Minister gave his speech, he was repeatedly interrupted by the Labour Party, and the Speaker had to intervene to restore order. After the Prime Minister finished his speech, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain spoke to end the debate, saying that the government's policy on unemployment relief was very effective. The government's refusal to spend huge amounts of money on public works was because it had to use this fee to promote ordinary trade. He expected that the recent increase in the number of unemployed would soon find jobs. The number of workers currently employed has increased by 700,000 compared to three years ago. The policies proposed by Britain or any other country cannot be compared with what this government has achieved. The government's various plans to restore export trade are gradually succeeding. The government does not want to abandon cheap currency and maintain a stable financial policy, because the continued effectiveness of the policy to reduce unemployed workers will only rely on this. After the debate, Lansbury's motion was put to a vote and defeated by a vote of 374 to 68. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e24">Japanese Upper House Member Advocates Changing to Silver Standard <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>On Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry Studies Concrete Plan</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Upper House held its first general accounting meeting at 1:44 p.m. today. Ryutaro Fukao (Koseikai) advocated that Japan abolish the gold standard and adopt the silver standard, and said that I have always opposed Manchuria's silver standard being changed to the gold standard, and I also oppose Japan's gold standard. I am gratified to hear that Finance Minister Takahashi also believes that it is not the time. I also believe that the currencies of China, Japan, and Manchuria must be unified, but I do not agree with the gold standard, and I advocate that Japan's gold standard be changed to the silver standard. Why should Japan adopt the same currency system as Europe and the United States? The fluctuation of silver prices is not necessarily frequent, and it sometimes fluctuates due to changes in gold prices. The price index in China has not changed much, which proves that the silver standard can be unimpeded. Therefore, I advocate that Japan voluntarily change to the silver standard and cooperate with China and Manchuria to form a silver group of the three countries. Finance Minister Takahashi replied to this by saying that I oppose Manchuria's abolition of the silver standard, and it seems that the Manchurian authorities do not have this intention either. I am not in a position to answer clearly about the theory of Japan changing to the silver standard. Fukao reiterated that he hoped that the authorities would work hard to unify the currency system in order to form a silver group of the three countries as soon as possible.

<p>[Tokyo] The opportunity for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has become increasingly strong. The Foreign Ministry has been holding consultations for days to study concrete plans. The Foreign Ministry authorities have the following general views on this: The fundamental problem of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is to eradicate the anti-Japanese movement in China. China's self-reliance is the most important thing. If China hopes to do so, it will not hesitate to provide technical assistance. In order to improve China's trade deficit, it is essential to import cheap Japanese goods in place of expensive European and American goods. If China actively improves Sino-Japanese trade and requests loans for settlement, it should fully consider appropriate measures. In order to revitalize China's cotton and other agriculture, it is urgent for Japan to provide technical assistance to restore China's economy and increase the purchasing power of the people.

<p>Lawyers Launch Fundraising Campaign to Prepare for Appeal</p>
<p>Mother Petitions President to Pardon Her Son's Death Sentence</p>
<p>Flemington – Today, the lawyer Reilly for Hauptmann, who was sentenced to death yesterday in Flemington, launched a fundraising appeal to save Mr. Hauptmann's life. He also claimed that he would request a stay of execution to allow for an appeal. Today, he will meet with Mr. Hauptmann to discuss the appeal. If the court does not allow the appeal, he will seek relief from the Court of Errors and Appeals. If the request for a reduced sentence is not approved, he will appeal to the Pardon Court, which is scheduled to convene in October. Mr. Hauptmann's mother in Germany has written to President Roosevelt, asking him to pardon her son's death sentence. Mr. Hauptmann has been weeping all night in jail, still claiming his innocence. It is reported that Mr. Hauptmann will be moved to the death row in Trenton, New Jersey tomorrow. It is now known that the jury voted six times before deciding on the death penalty. One male juror named Clava, a conservative education leader in New Jersey, voted five times that Mr. Hauptmann was guilty but advocated for leniency. Two female jurors also initially advocated for commuting Mr. Hauptmann's death sentence on the first vote but changed their position on the second vote and convicted Mr. Hauptmann of first-degree murder. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>

Fearing that he would commit suicide, the jailers are now closely monitoring him. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Flemington – The local prison has allowed journalists to visit Bruno Hauptmann, the suspect in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and murder case, for the first time. Hauptmann told reporters, "If I must die in the electric chair, I will face it calmly." When asked if there was anything to confess, he replied, "If I had anything to confess, I would have done so months ago so that my wife and son would not suffer. I am penniless and cannot afford an appeal. If the public does not help me, I will ask my lawyer to appeal for me." (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] According to the request of the cotton spinning industry, the Shanghai General Labor Union stated that the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange opened both yarn and cotton auctions simultaneously, leading speculators to knowingly raise prices and hoard supplies despite domestic cotton production being insufficient.

They requested the establishment of relief measures to maintain the yarn industry and workers' livelihoods. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Industry, they are currently discussing with the Ministry of Finance to find ways to maintain the balance between the prices of yarn and cotton auctions at the exchange, and whether to stop the cotton auctions will depend on the actual situation.

<h3 id="e95">"War Zone" Clearance Committee Decides on Clearance Procedures <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Important Chinese and Japanese Figures Exchange Views at the Yin Residence; The Japanese Side Understands the New Peace Preservation Corps; Umezu, Isogu, and Others to Inspect Chahar and Suiyuan</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The "war zone" clearance issue, which has been stalled for nearly half a year, has recently been brought up again for negotiations. Doihara, the head of the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency in Shenyang, recently came to Peiping and Tianjin and separately convened responsible representatives from both sides to exchange views. Doihara has now left Tianjin and headed south. Important figures from both sides, such as Iwai (representative of the Kwantung Army), Oki (representative of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin), Takahashi (military attaché of the Japanese Embassy), as well as Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and others, came to Peiping together yesterday (the 13th) afternoon at around 6 PM and continued the meeting at the Yin residence in Dongzongbu Hutong. According to reliable sources, a concrete decision has been generally reached regarding the "war zone" clearance issue as a result of discussions between the representatives of both sides. However, regarding the implementation steps, the Japanese side indicated that the Chinese side can decide and respond. The "War Zone" Clearance Committee then held a meeting at the West Building of the Political Reorganization Committee this afternoon (the 14th) at 3 PM. Standing Committee members Yin Tong and Zhu Shiqin, as well as committee members Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, Yue Kaixian, and Xu Tongxin, attended on time. The committee members conducted a thorough discussion on the issue. After an hour, the implementation procedures were decided, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM. Yin Tong has scheduled to officially respond to the Japanese side tomorrow (the 15th) to actively begin the clearance work. The reporter met Yin Tong at a certain place this afternoon (the 14th). According to him, "Although a concrete result has been achieved with the Japanese side regarding the 'war zone' issue, there are still many matters that need further discussion before implementation. What I can briefly tell you is that the Japanese side has understood the matter of the newly organized Peace Preservation Corps entering the war zone. The number is agreed upon to be around 9,000, including 4,000 police officers, carrying light weapons, and the Japanese side has no objection. This matter can be realized after another round of negotiations. Secondly, regarding the issue of receiving the Eastern Tombs of Malanyu, we must wait for Takahashi Tan, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, to go to Changchun next month, report to Nanjirō, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, and return to Peiping before further discussions can be conducted." Yin stated solemnly, "The 'war zone' issue was virtually suspended due to certain reasons in the past. In order to bring the 'war zone' clearance work to a conclusion as soon as possible, our side requested continued discussions with the Japanese side. Recently, the voices of improving Sino-Japanese relations have been rising, so the 'war zone' issue has also had the opportunity to be resolved smoothly. The future, whether smooth or not, depends on the efforts of all parties."</p>
<p>Several important Japanese figures who have come to Peiping in recent days include Iwai, Oki, and Umezu Mijirō, the commander of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, who arrived in Peiping this afternoon (the 14th), as well as Isogu, the newly appointed Japanese military attaché to Shanghai. He Yingqin, the chairman of the Military Council, hosted a banquet at Jurenhall this evening (the 14th) to welcome them in order to fulfill the hospitality of the host. He also invited Japanese military attaché Takahashi, as well as Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, Zhu Shiqin, Yue Kaixian, and others to accompany them. The atmosphere was lively, and the guests and hosts dispersed in enjoyment at around 9 PM. Umezu came to Peiping to study Japanese academia in North China and plans to go to Datong to view the Yungang Grottoes project before inspecting Chahar and Suiyuan. Zhu Zheyuan, the chairman of Chahar, instructed Qin Decun, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, by telegram from Tianjin to return to Zhangjiakou from Peiping at 3:30 PM this afternoon (the 14th) to prepare for hospitality matters in order to properly host him. Isogu was originally the director of the Second Department of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters. Recently, due to the transfer of the military attaché to Shanghai to his home country, he was appointed to succeed him. He will first go to Peiping and Tianjin, then inspect Chahar and Suiyuan before going to Shanghai to take office. When he passes through Nanjing, he will meet with our officials. As for the future whereabouts of Iwai and Oki, it is learned that Oki will return to Tianjin in the coming days, and Iwai will go directly to Changchun from Peiping to report everything to Nanjirō.</p>
<p>According to general observations, the "war zone" issue can be brought to a conclusion within the next two months. After Yin Tong responds to the Japanese side on the implementation steps of our clearance tomorrow (the 15th), if necessary, he will go south to meet with Huang Fu in person to report the negotiations with the Japanese side. Tao Shangming has been away from Tangshan for a long time. According to reports, he plans to return to Tangshan the day after tomorrow (the 16th) to manage government affairs. As for the actual implementation period of the clearance work, in fact, it may begin at the beginning of next month. In short, since the issue of the troop rotation of the New Peace Preservation Corps in the "war zone" can be resolved, other issues may be easier to find a solution. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Sichuan: After the Establishment of the New Provincial Government <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Issues Earnest Instructions to County Magistrates</p>
<p>Integrity Should Be the Foundation of Politics</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Sichuan's politics have not been on the right track due to the fact that the defense zones have not been broken for many years. Now that the Sichuan bandits are gradually being suppressed, Liu Xiang, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression, has been ordered to preside over provincial administration. Various armies have handed over their power to the government. Liu is known for his integrity, and Sichuan's administration is expected to improve. Since the new provincial government was established on the 10th of this month, the work has been quite tense. Liu arrives at the provincial government early every morning to handle important official matters. The directors of various departments and the secretary-general arrive on time to work diligently. Liu also believes that clean governance is paramount for officials close to the people, so that the people can live and work in peace. Yesterday, he issued a notice to all counties, earnestly admonishing and warning them to strive for improvement, strictly prohibiting petty annoyances to the people, and put forward three key points to instruct them on cultivating the people and being honest in office, which are extremely pertinent. The original text is as follows: "It is hereby noted that modern politics emphasizes efficiency the most. Since the establishment of this government, it is urgent to implement government orders and govern effectively. According to our country's administrative divisions, the county is an important unit. County administration must be substantial in order for the entire administration to have a foundation. I hereby highlight the key points to indicate the political goals. First, recognize the mission of the times. Governments and officials are established for the people, and their position is that of public servants. Approaching the masses is their duty, and serving the people is their responsibility. Loyalty and diligence are only fulfilling one's duties, and there is no so-called meritorious administration. County magistrates should recognize their own positions and should go deep among the people, diligently seek the people's stability, and inspect on time as a fixed routine. Private visits are only accidental, while pacifying the people is a divine duty. From now on, implement being close to the people and strictly prohibit petty annoyances. This is the first point that should be earnestly warned. Second, be realistic. In recent years, the political system has been uneven, and laws and regulations have been complicated. Those who are careful are troubled by coping, and those who are clever use it as an excuse to make a fuss. Now that provincial administration is centralized, it is precisely to take simplicity. Since county magistrates have reduced the burden of paperwork, they should focus their energy on reality. It must be known that official documents are a manifestation of official affairs, and official affairs are not just official documents. From now on, the chairman will evaluate political achievements based solely on reality and will never rank them based on official documents. County magistrates should strive for improvement and not take a passive approach to save trouble. If they only follow the form, it is merely seeking temporary peace and being opportunistic. Without sincerity, there is nothing. Deceiving the people is deceiving oneself. This is the second point that should be earnestly warned. Third, hone one's integrity. The Six Strategies emphasize integrity, and the Three Admonitions emphasize incorruptibility. It is a common meaning throughout history that integrity is the foundation of politics. It must be that one is not casual about trivial matters so that one can be free from shame. At this time of financial exhaustion and popular impoverishment, with the upper and lower classes in difficulty, and seeing the suffering of the people, how can one bear to enrich oneself? In recent years, the meaning of popular governance has flourished greatly. Private wealth must also be restrained. If one cleverly seizes the people's wealth, it is going against the natural order. Heaven is impartial and will not allow self-preservation. County magistrates who receive salaries are all supported by the people. To hold a position without doing anything is already shameful, let alone being corrupt. This is the third point that should be earnestly warned. The above three points are not only the common meaning of serving as an official but also the ordinary virtues of life. The chairman will use this to evaluate performance and is determined to implement it. After this admonition, the county magistrates should be mindful of the difficulties of the times, be diligent in caring for the people's suffering, and strive to arouse their conscience and earnestly practice them. If the government is clear and bright, the achievements of governance will have a foundation. Today, the people are in dire straits and need to be saved. If there is a little good governance, there will be celebrations of their well-being. The proverb says that it is easy to be a good official in chaotic times, which is truly a well-considered statement. The chairman earnestly admonishes and is straightforward without concealment. If anyone dares to be negligent, he will be immediately dismissed. Those who are corrupt with evidence will be severely punished if the people accuse them and it is found to be true or if the government discovers it. There will be no leniency. This order is to be promulgated immediately, and you are to abide by it respectfully. This is the order." (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Japanese Ronin in Qingdao Selling Certificates for Entry into the Puppet State <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Government Sends Letter to Japanese Consulate Requesting Crackdown</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Last September, Japanese ronin once established the "Great East Company" at the Qingdao Dagaan Wharf, selling certificates for entry into the puppet state of Manchuria. The municipal government filed a protest with the Japanese Consul in Qingdao, and the Japanese Consulate sent police to crack down, and the company had already disappeared without a trace. Unexpectedly, after several months, the company suddenly reappeared, openly posting notices and selling certificates for entry into the puppet state of Manchuria, priced at one yuan each. It officially opened on the 12th of this month, with the office located on Xinjiang Road in Dagaan. A notice posted outside the gate stated: "Notice: For the convenience of those entering Manchuria and to save expenses, this company has established free lodging for Chinese workers in Xinjing, Fengtian, Dalian, Andong, Yingkou, and other places. It specializes in providing vocational introductions, negotiations, and assistance for illnesses and disasters for those entering Manchuria, without charging any fees. Those entering Manchuria are requested to pay attention to this. Detailed information can be obtained at this office." The company also notified various shipping companies that all Chinese workers traveling to Manchuria from Qingdao by ship must carry the pseudo-state certificate sold by the company, otherwise, in addition to the person not being allowed to land, the shipping company would bear considerable responsibility upon arrival. When the No. 16 Kyodo Maru left on the 13th, a large number of Chinese workers boarded the ship to go to the Eastern Provinces to make a living, all carrying the pseudo-state certificate. They were discovered by the guards at the Dagaan Wharf, who reported it to the Dagaan Police Station, detaining 102 people. By this time, 125 people had already boarded the ship and could not be stopped. It was found that these Chinese workers were all farmers from various counties in the Shandong interior. Due to rural bankruptcy, they were unable to make a living and were taking advantage of the spring warmth to go to the Northeast to make a living. Since they were detained by the Public Security Bureau, they could neither go nor return, and they wandered near the Dagaan Wharf and refused to leave. The Public Security Bureau reported this situation to the municipal government. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to send these farmers back to their original places, the municipal government sent many plainclothes police officers to spread throughout the wharf, intercepting anyone holding the pseudo-state certificate. It also sent a letter to the Japanese Consulate for serious negotiations, requesting that they strictly crack down. Therefore, when the Fengtian Maru departed on the 14th, no one was allowed to leave. However, the company, fearing that it would be affected by the intervention of our officials, also sent several Japanese policemen to patrol near the wharf. The Japanese policemen went to the police station and questioned them. The patrol officer replied that it was being done under orders from above. The Japanese policemen left reluctantly. The attitude of the Japanese Consul towards this matter is not yet known. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Local Reorganization of the Shanxi Provincial Government <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>—Changes of Provincial Committee and Various Officials—</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: There have been slight adjustments among the members of the Shanxi Provincial Government recently. One is Wang Maogong's resignation from the Provincial Committee, one is Lu Jinli's resignation from his concurrent position as Director of the Department of Construction while also serving on the Provincial Committee, and one is Geng Buchan's reassignment while also serving on the Provincial Committee and Director of the Department of Industry, with the Department of Industry being fundamentally abolished. The affairs handled by the Department of Industry are merged into the Department of Construction, and all of Geng's concurrent positions are dismissed. It is found that Wang Maogong was originally the Director of the Zhengtai Railway Bureau. The reason why he concurrently served on the Provincial Committee was simply to facilitate the nearby transmission of the intentions of the Central Government and the Shanxi Provincial Government, remotely leading in name only. Wang only attended the Provincial Government meetings once or twice at the beginning of his term and never inquired about provincial affairs. He resigned from the Zhengtai Railway Bureau a month ago because he was unsuited to the northern climate and often suffered from illness. The position of Shanxi Provincial Committee was naturally unable to be remotely held for a long time. Lu Jinli, the Director of the Department of Construction, had once served as the Director of the Tianjin Customs Office after being relieved of his duties due to the changes in the political situation in the north in 1911. After more than a year, due to the complexity of his duties and the difficulty of finance, he firmly requested to resign. The authorities retained him without success and changed him to serve as the Director of the Department of Construction. Lu still had a one-year term, and by the end of last winter, the term expired and he again firmly resigned and no longer went to the department to handle affairs. It is heard that Lu's intention is to abandon his official career and engage in industry and make other contributions. In addition, Lu is a financial expert in Shanxi Province. This time, he was only allowed to resign from the position of Director of the Department, and the title of Provincial Committee member was still retained, and the authorities relied on him and did not let him get rid of it. Geng Buchan, who served concurrently as Director of the Department of Industry, once served as Director of the Department of Industry when Shanxi was first established in 1927. He went into retirement in 1930 when the Shanxi situation changed. Later, Yan Xishan returned to Shanxi, and Geng took over the Department of Industry for the second time. The reason for the abolition of the Department of Industry this time is that Yan has set a ten-year construction plan for provincial administration and established the Northwest Industrial Company to actively carry out. All industrial matters in the province are handled by the company, and what remains is only a very simple administrative surface article, and it is naturally unnecessary to set up a special department. Yan attaches great importance to the Northwest Industrial Company in recent times, and the promotion of the ten-year construction plan will be based on this as a source. Various factories and other public utilities set up by the company have been established one after another and expanded in turn. Recently, Liang Ruzhou (now renamed Hangbiao), the former Director of the Xingying Office, was appointed as the general manager, responsible for planning everything. Although Liang has repeatedly refused, he has agreed to take office after Yan's persuasion. Liang is the backbone of the newly advanced faction in Yan's staff. His appointment to this important position will help Yan's industrial construction. The vacancies of Wang and Geng on the Provincial Committee have now been filled, one by Fan Xiangli, the former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and current Director of the Village Administration Office of the Shanxi Provincial Government, and the other by Wang Xiang, the current Director of the Shanxi Provincial Bank. Wang also concurrently serves as the Director of the Department of Construction. Wang was originally a member of the academic community and gained fame for running the Provincial No. 1 Middle School in the early years of the Republic of China, which is still praised by people today. In the past two years, he has made great achievements in sorting out the bank's business and has suddenly assumed his current position. The vacancy of the bank manager left by Wang has been filled by Wang Qian, the current Secretary-General of the Provincial Government. The vacancy of the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government will be filled by Li Naijing, the current Director of the Opium Suppression Assessment Office. In addition, Geng Buchan, the relieved Director of the Department of Industry, has been appointed by Yan as a senior advisor to the Suiyuan Appeasement Office. This is a scene of recent ups and downs in the Shanxi situation. (February 9)</p>

<p>Trial Implementation in Hubei Province First, Then Extended to Other Provinces</p>
<p>Crackdown on Opium Cultivation and Elimination of Other Narcotics</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in order to eliminate opium and other narcotics, issued an order to ten provinces, including Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, to strictly prohibit opium, and established an Opium Prohibition Supervisory Office in Hankou, with Li Jihong as the director, presiding over everything. In order to effectively promote opium prohibition, the office decided to implement a supervisory system. Each province and special municipality will establish an opium prohibition supervisory commissioner, and each county and city will establish supervisors, responsible for handling matters. The plan has been submitted to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for approval, and will be implemented in Hubei province first, followed by others. The supervisory matters to be carried out by the supervisory commissioners are seven in number: (1) prohibit the cultivation of opium seedlings and eliminate highly toxic narcotics; (2) crack down on the number and level of opium paste shops and issue licenses with the number of users filled in; (3) matters relating to the seizure of narcotics in various counties and cities; (4) matters relating to opium prohibition statistical books and forms; (5) assessment of the performance of opium dens in various counties and cities; (6) matters assigned by order; (7) making recommendations to the Opium Prohibition Supervisory Office and directing supervisors in various counties and cities to carry out supervisory matters. The tasks of supervisors in various counties and cities are roughly the same. The Hubei provincial supervisory commissioners will be appointed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and will be supervised and directed by the Opium Prohibition Supervisory Office. The list of candidates is still to be decided. The county and city inspectors will be appointed by the Opium Prohibition Supervisory Office in accordance with the jurisdiction of the administrative supervisory district, namely: Ye Guangyong in the First District, Lin Gongren in the Second District, Yang Runnong in the Third District, Cheng Wuchang in the Fourth District, Peng Yigan in the Fifth District, Mi Jinglin in the Sixth District, Li Songxian in the Seventh District, Che Zhiwen in the Eighth District, He Fuzhou in the Ninth District, Wang Yue in the Tenth District, and Zhang Gu in the Eleventh District. A letter has been sent to the provincial government today to instruct the administrative commissioners and county magistrates of various districts to assist in the process. (14th)</p>

<p>Passenger Jumps into River and Commits Suicide</p>
<p>At Fengjia Ferry outside the South Gate, on the afternoon of the thirteenth, an unidentified man crossed the river from north to south. When the boat was in the middle of the river, he suddenly jumped into the water. The boatmen Feng Qinfa and Feng Guiqin tried their best to rescue him, but he was already barely breathing and unable to speak. After a few minutes, he died. The case was reported to the court's prosecutor's office, which dispatched Prosecutor Liu Shanjun with bailiff Han Mingzhong, coroner Wang Jian, and others yesterday to examine the body. The deceased was about thirty years old, wearing a dark-colored cotton padded jacket and trousers, and a blue cloth apron. There were no injuries on the body, confirming that he had jumped into the river and committed suicide. An order was issued for the local police to take custody of the body at the Cangfen Altar, and a notice was posted to identify the deceased.</p>
<p>Youth Attempts Suicide by Poisoning, Rescued</p>
<p>Tu Xiuzai, a 25-year-old youth from Suzhou, previously worked as a jacquard pattern technician at a textile factory in Wuxian County. Due to the factory's closure, he lost his job and came to Shanghai to seek employment without success. Running out of money, he walked to Songjiang, but having no relatives or friends, he became despondent. He ingested raw opium and lay down under the eaves of the Caishen Temple in Yangjia Bridge within the city. The police discovered him and took him to the First Precinct, then transferred him to the hospital for treatment, where he was revived. Officer Lu then bought him a train ticket back to his hometown to prevent him from wandering in a foreign land.</p>

<p>Treasury Department Strictly Pursues Old Taxes</p>
<p>Since 1927, Wuxian County has accumulated 680,000 yuan in back taxes, with the Dongting East and West Mountains owing the most, about 200,000 yuan. The Treasury Department has specially dispatched tax collection commissioner Guo Fupei to Suzhou to discuss collection methods with the county government. The deadline is from February to the end of June. If the taxes are not paid by the deadline, the defaulting households will be detained, or their property will be seized.</p>

<p>Death Caused by Excessive Drinking</p>
<p>Hu Yunxiang, a 53-year-old villager from near Lu Yigong Temple north of Banqiao outside the East Gate of this county, drank excessively at the East Gate the day before yesterday. Returning home at night, he carried a lamp, which caught fire, burning his clothes. In his drunken stupor, he did not notice, and the fire spread to his whole body, burning him to death near the north end of Banqiao. The next day, passersby discovered the body. His family claimed the body for burial. Furthermore, Yan Zhongmou, a 45-year-old villager residing near Guanjia Bridge in Chaihang Township outside the East Gate, gambled with friends after drinking, losing all his money. He had long harbored a grudge against his relatives and feared being scolded upon returning home. Therefore, at about 4 a.m. that morning, he hastily went to the river near Guanjia Bridge and drowned himself. After the body was discovered, it was retrieved and prepared for burial.</p>

<p>Citywide Strike Calmed</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau and the Fire Brigade in this county clashed over gambling arrests, resulting in the destruction of the North Section Fire Brigade and the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. The Public Security Bureau also detained and beat firefighters, which triggered a citywide strike. The police also briefly went on strike, causing widespread panic and chaos. After the Party and government officials made every effort to mediate, the strike gradually subsided. It is said that the strike was caused by the Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Yuchu's abrupt handling of affairs, which gave the public a very bad impression, causing public resentment to boil over and nearly become uncontrollable. Fortunately, County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, together with the Party headquarters and local figures, properly mediated the situation, which was resolved without incident. Yesterday (the 15th) morning, all the stores in the city resumed business, and social order was restored. Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Yuchu's family packed up and returned to Hangzhou on the day of the incident. Hong Houchang, chief of the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, Gu Songdong, a bureau member, and all the staff, as well as Tong Zhongyue, chief of the Third Branch, and Ling Guangyuan, patrol officer of the Seventh Sub-station, all resigned.</p>
<p>Another Fire in Cotton Alley</p>
<p>The home of Chen Daguan, resident of No. 49 Cotton Alley outside the West Gate, consisted of four sections of single-story buildings. Jiang Qingyun Lumber Yard was to the west of the house. Chen had two young sons and a daughter. Yesterday (the 15th) morning around 10 a.m., the children were playing with fire in the fourth section, causing a fire to break out. Soon, flames burst through the roof. Residents nearby immediately rang gongs to raise the alarm. Fire brigades One and Two of the West District, upon hearing the alarm, immediately rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire. As a result, the fourth section of the house was completely burned down. Although the first, second, and third sections were not affected, many parts were damaged due to the rescue efforts. The total loss is estimated at 500-600 yuan.</p>
<p>Robbery with Injury in Tianxian Port</p>
<p>In Fan Alley, Tianxian Port, about three li north of Zhangjing Bridge in this county, there are more than a dozen households, mostly farmers. The day before yesterday (the 14th) around 11 p.m., more than thirty robbers suddenly came to the home of Lu Xingquan in the village, broke down the door, and threatened them to silence. They tied Xingquan to a long bench with rope, poured lime water down his throat, and forced him to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Xingquan nearly died three times before revealing that the collected association money was hidden in the mud of the pigsty. The robbers, upon hearing this, rushed to search, and as a result, more than 700 yuan was robbed. The robbers were not satisfied and went to Lu Jinbao's house to rob, also stealing 18 yuan in silver dollars, five dan of white rice, and clothing. Fortunately, no one was injured. Before leaving, they set off three firecrackers to show their power. The two victims have reported the losses to the county bureau and requested an investigation.</p>

<p>High Court Thoroughly Investigates Bribery Case of Warden</p>
<p>Hu A-yu, a morphine dealer from Qingyang, was detained in the county last year and sentenced to two years in prison and a fine of 200 yuan by Judge Shi Cheng. He was imprisoned. It was reported that Hu faked illness and asked someone to bail him out. Someone accused the High Court, pointing to Chen Shusheng, the former warden (from Wangting, Suzhou), and Huang Youbo, the former town leader of Sihetangtou Bridge, along with villagers Qian Rongbing and Xue Gengshen, of defrauding 1,000 yuan in bribes to influence Judges Zhu and Qian of the High Court to help him. The High Court, based on the accusation, considered the case involved bribery and the reputation of the court, and ordered the Jiangyin County Government to summon Huang Youbo and others to court on the 13th to question Hu A-yu. Huang Youbo and others strongly denied the allegations. Questioning Hu A-yu, he also firmly denied it. Statements were recorded and submitted to the High Court for review.</p>

<p>Around 4 p.m. on the 14th, a car No. 262 of the Zhonghua Road Xinzhen Automobile Company was returning to the city from Zhulin Temple with passengers. While driving on the Zhongzheng Road at the Louxiang intersection, an eight-year-old child named Liu Layuezi was on the roadside and failed to avoid the car. The car ran over him head-on, crushing his skull and spilling blood all over the ground. He died on the spot. The police saw the situation and immediately apprehended the driver, surnamed Zhou, and seized a driver's license No. 1444. They took him to the Second Precinct and notified the court to send someone to the scene for investigation.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I have read the news in your esteemed newspaper on the 11th of this month regarding the disappearance of the director of the Heyang Agricultural Education Center in Changshu, which has caused me great astonishment. I, Qian Xijin, reported and wrote off the public funds accounts, etc., during my tenure at the County Library in the past year, and reported the handover situation to the Education Bureau together with Mr. Cai. As for the false accusation that I, Qian Xijin, have embezzled all the public accumulation fund, it will be clear upon inquiry with the Education Bureau. Later, I was ordered to be transferred to the Taihe Agricultural Education Center for consolidation, and the department ordered the appointment of the director of the better performing center of the two centers, so I was appointed to my current position. The evidence is still there and is not difficult to verify. At the time when our center is holding the annual custom exhibition, it is said that I suddenly disappeared, and the staff has asked the Education Bureau for instructions, etc., which I do not know what it refers to. This rumor is obviously for other purposes. As it concerns my personal reputation, I specially request the editor to correct it. I am grateful and wish you well.</p>

<p>Says Tibetan People Enthusiastically Support the Central Government</p>
<p>Will Go to Beijing Within Days to Report to the Central Government</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Musong, the special envoy dispatched by the Central Government to Tibet to offer sacrifices to the late Dalai Lama, returned to China via India last winter. He arrived in Hong Kong at the beginning of the month and took a short trip to Guangdong Province. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:30 a.m. on the Queen of Asia from Hong Kong. After disembarking, Mr. Huang went to the Zhou Dou Restaurant to rest and is scheduled to go to Beijing today or tomorrow to report everything to the Central Government. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, those who went to the Gonghexiang Wharf to welcome him yesterday included: Li Dachao, representative of the Municipal Government; Xu Jinyuan, representative of the Songhu Garrison Commander; Lieutenant General Liu Zhilu; Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department; Guo Weiping, Staff Officer of the Border Affairs Group of the National Government's General Staff; Xie Zhongfu, Member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee; Pan Dajing, Executive of the Northwest Problem Research Association; Li Yuxuan, Li Fengwu, and Gu Yuhui, representatives of the Guangdong Native Place Association in Shanghai; Aisa, former Secretary of the Xinjiang Construction Committee; as well as the Tibetan Office in Beijing, the Jiaying Five Prefectures Native Place Association, and more than 50 relatives and friends of Special Envoy Huang. The Guangdong Native Place Association and the Jiaying Five Prefectures Native Place Association representatives all held flags welcoming Special Envoy Huang.</p>
<p>Arrival Situation</p>
<p>The ship entered the port at 9 a.m. and arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf at 10 a.m. All the welcoming personnel gathered at the wharf to wait. After docking, Special Envoy Huang and his entourage were the first to disembark. All the welcoming personnel crowded around to greet him. Mr. Huang shook hands and thanked them one by one.

<p>Huang's Speech</p>
<p>According to Mr. Huang, the process of my entering Tibet has been reported by various newspapers one after another, so there is no need to repeat it. The current situation in Tibet is very good. The people of Tibet have a sincere desire to support the Central Government and also expressed their welcome for the return of the Panchen Lama to Tibet. As for when the Panchen Lama will return to Tibet, I have not heard anything about it. The actions of the British in Tibet are all within the scope of the treaty and there is no special force. The standing army in Tibet is about several thousand people, all conscripted. Since the death of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan administration has been temporarily represented by the Reting Hutuktu. As for the official successor, he has not yet been produced. It is said that Tibet will send representatives to Beijing to thank the Central Government for its kindness. The candidates have been decided, but the date of departure for Beijing is currently unknown. I am scheduled to go to Beijing today or tomorrow to report everything to the Central Government, he said.</p>
<p>Journey to Tibet</p>
<p>According to Mr. Gao Shifu, who accompanied Special Envoy Huang to Tibet, speaking to the Huadong News Agency, Special Envoy Huang left Beijing on April 26 last year and flew west. Before Special Envoy Huang set off, two batches of entourage had already entered Tibet. The first batch took a ship on March 18 and entered Tibet via India by sea. This included Councilor Jiang and Secretary Wang, etc. The second batch left Beijing on March 28 and went west, led by Deputy Officer Gao and 40 guards, who traveled to Chengdu to wait for Special Envoy Huang. On April 26, after Special Envoy Huang arrived in Chengdu, they set off together for Tibet. On August 28, they finally arrived in Lhasa. They passed through more than twenty large and small mountains along the way, with wind and snow all around, experiencing hardship. However, they were warmly welcomed by the monks and lay people of Tibet along the way, and the Tibetan authorities also protected them with sincerity. The grand reception was unprecedented in decades. Upon arriving in Lhasa, the Tibetan people were particularly happy and encouraged, because they had not seen</p>

<p>The Central Government has a high-ranking official coming here. Now Special Envoy Huang is going to offer sacrifices and represent the National Government to perform the conferment ceremony. They all think that this is clear evidence that the Central Government has not forgotten Tibet, and they also know that the Central Government still regards Tibet as a brotherly state, so their happy state overflows their words. During his stay in Tibet, Special Envoy Huang, in addition to representing the National Government to offer sacrifices and confer titles, also took the time to investigate the customs and sentiments of Tibet. After staying for three months, he set off to leave Tibet. After leaving Tibet on November 28, he arrived in India on December 18. Special Envoy Huang took this opportunity to tour India, Nepal, the Malay Peninsula and other places. I and other guards returned first, arriving in Shanghai by ship on January 28. Special Envoy Huang is from right to left (1) Zhu Haishan (2) Awang Jianzan (3) Yixi Bozheng (4) Li Jingyu (5) Zejue Zhongni</p>

After Special Envoy Huang arrives in Shanghai, he is scheduled to stay for one day and return to Beijing tomorrow night to report his mission.</p>

<p>Dr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, took leave last year to return to China to work on the issue of unity. Now that his vacation in The Hague has expired, he was originally scheduled to take the Italian liner Conte Verde on the 13th to Europe to resume his duties. However, because Premier Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan sent a telegram from Beijing requesting a meeting in Shanghai, he temporarily postponed his departure. After two discussions the day before yesterday, the official business was completed. However, there are no direct ships to Europe these days, so he had to purchase a cabin on the President Pierce liner of the Dollar Steamship Company, taking a detour through the United States and then to Europe. At 11:40 last night, Mr. Wang took a ferry from the Xinguang Wharf across the river and boarded the President Pierce liner. Wei Daoming, Xiao Jingfang, and Mr. Wang's relatives and friends went to the wharf to see him off. The ship is scheduled to set sail at 7 a.m. this morning and will go to the United States via Japan. After arriving in the United States, Mr. Wang will change ships to The Hague to resume his duties. Mr. Wang issued a written statement last night before his departure, saying, "I returned to China last year because of a vacation. Considering that the proposals of the leaders were not consistent, driven by my conscience and the instructions of my friends, I came out to run around. The process has been mentioned before, so I will not repeat it. I traveled back and forth between Ningbo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangdong, conveying the proposals of comrades from all parties to each other, in order to facilitate understanding. As a result, due to the sincerity of all comrades, opinions have become more consistent. Because I have been away from the country for three years, every time I go to a place, I must observe its recent situation. Now I see that the construction of the mainland and the people's knowledge and thoughts, and the concept of the country have made great progress. If we can get the appropriate guidance from the public opinion, the future is full of hope. Because my vacation has expired, I cannot stay any longer. I originally intended to take the Italian liner to Europe on the 13th, but because of unfinished private affairs, I could not leave. I changed to an American ship and went to Europe via Japan and the United States, so that I can see the situation in Japan and the United States. I am expected to return to my post at the end of March. "</p>

<p>Six Legal Items</p>
<p>Nanjing Telephone, since the silver crisis occurred, affecting the entire financial market, some small banks in Shanghai, due to insufficient preparation, have announced liquidation. The Ministry of Finance has the responsibility of supervising the banks and also has the responsibility of representing the society in inspection. In order to prevent such incidents from reoccurring, a ministry order was issued to send Dai Mingli, section chief of the Currency Department, and several others to Shanghai to conduct on-site inspections of various banks. The matters needing attention are: (1) Whether the bank's capital is the same as when originally reported, (2) Whether the reserve of issued banknotes meets the number stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, (3) The total amount of social deposits, (4) Which item the business operation focuses on most, (5) The ratio of loans to deposits, (6) The profit and loss of the business last year. It is said that this inspection is a kind of exercise of supervisory power and has no other meaning. At the same time, because it relates to social trust issues, the procedures do not seek to be pressed and the period depends on the inspection situation. There are no set requirements.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Military Council and Executive Yuan - Issue a Circular to Protect Public Opinion <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Inspection and Prohibition Must Strictly Abide by Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association, the Journalists Association, and various newspapers in Tianjin and Beiping, during the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, separately telegraphed requesting careful handling of news inspection. The plenary session was divided into the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, the Military Affairs Committee, and the Executive Yuan for review. In addition to the Standing Committee of the Central Committee having already resolved the inspection standards and issued a circular for compliance, the Military Affairs Committee and the Executive Yuan have also jointly issued a circular to the provincial and municipal governments, instructing their subordinates to comply with it in its entirety. The original order states: "Case investigation on the occasion of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in December 1934, the various newspapers in Tianjin and Shanghai jointly telegraphed requesting: (1) News inspection should strictly abide by the standards promulgated by the Central Government and be carefully implemented; (2) Disciplinary action against news organizations or reporters should not resort to extraordinary means; (3) For news organizations or reporters who have been suspended, detained, or otherwise punished in the central or local government, as long as they are not backed by force or violence, please reinstate them uniformly. The Central Standing Committee resolved to submit the case to the Committee for review. The investigation and revision of the news inspection standards, the revised measures for news inspection in important cities, and the outline of the measures for news inspection have been successively formulated by the Central Government and circulated for compliance. The procedures for setting up news inspection offices and the standards for news inspection have been detailed in the above-mentioned measures and standards. The newspaper's request regarding (1) news inspection should strictly abide by the standards promulgated by the Central Government and be carefully implemented; (2) disciplinary action against news organizations or reporters should not resort to extraordinary means; are both legitimate. As for (3) news organizations or reporters who have been suspended, detained, or otherwise punished in the central or local government, as long as they are not backed by force or violence, please reinstate them uniformly. The investigation and news inspection, in addition to complying with the provisions of the revised news inspection standards, must also comply with the provisions of Articles 36, 37, 39, 40, and 41 of the Publication Law and Items 2 and 3 of the Examination Standards for Propaganda Products. Note 1 to the revised news inspection standards has already been clearly stipulated. Also, according to Articles 36, 37, 39, 40, and 41 of the Publication Law, if a newspaper violates the Publication Law, its publication may be prohibited, and the publisher, editor, etc., may be sentenced to imprisonment or detention for up to one year. Therefore, it is difficult to uniformly reinstate news organizations or reporters who have been suspended, detained, or otherwise punished in the central or local government, regardless of the circumstances. If those who have been punished believe that the punishment is improper or illegal, they may separately file an appeal or petition, and there is no need to worry about not having a remedy. The original telegram's claim should not be discussed. However, the government has repeatedly issued orders to protect freedom of speech. The inspection and prohibition of various speech organizations by various agencies should be handled in accordance with laws and regulations. In the future, we should encourage even more, and strive to implement the Central Government's policy of supporting public opinion. Freedom of speech is originally freedom within the scope of the law and is not without restrictions. The majority of domestic speech organizations are aware of the overall situation, abide by the law, and love themselves, but there are still some that are unhealthy and immature. Some disclose national military and diplomatic secrets, or knowingly spread rumors in order to achieve the private goal of provoking discord and shaking people's hearts, or harbor grudges and use the position of the newspaper to wantonly damage the reputation of others. Because of this, they violate the law and discipline, or cause retaliation from the injured party. The government should do its best to encourage all fair and excellent newspapers, but it must also enforce the law against those with improper motives who do not know the law. Those who are ignorant of the truth do not investigate the content and add the term "destroying public opinion" to the inspection agencies, hoping to sensationalize the public. In this way, if freedom is spoken of, the result may be that newspapers have freedom, but the people have no protection. The selfishness of a few is fast, and the majority suffers. The loss is small, then the value of public opinion is reduced. If it is large, the interests of the country are damaged, and the malpractices are so numerous, how can they be overcome? For this purpose, all agencies are ordered that they should protect sound public opinion and not abuse their power. For inspection and prohibition matters, they must comply with laws and regulations and not exceed them slightly. On the one hand, they must strictly comply with laws and regulations and not overstep their authority slightly. On the other hand, all speech organizations in various places must also be kindly informed, so that they can restrain themselves and strive to abide by journalistic ethics, and do not abuse the power of newspapers to harm the interests of the country and others, so that the national news industry can be expected to enter the right track, and the effectiveness of public opinion can be promoted, and the foundation of the rule of law can be established. The burden is on this. In addition to separate orders, the order is for compliance, and it is also instructed to forward it to all subordinates for compliance. The Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association has already received the Shanghai Municipal Government's instruction to inform them.</p>

<p>Nanjing Telephone: The Ministry of Communications has ordered the China Merchants Bureau, stating that the debts incurred by the Bureau during the Northern Government era for telecommunications were substantial. The Bureau has been working to clear these debts for over two years, and after several months of negotiation, a resolution has fortunately been reached. Considering that the Bureau's debts related to shipping administration are also significant and resemble the unresolved telecommunications debts, the Bureau should adopt appropriate telecommunications reorganization methods and actively reorganize the debts. In addition to instructing the General Manager and Board of Directors, a copy of the telecommunications reorganization methods should be sent to the Board for reference. The Board should promptly notify the Bureau's creditors to discuss debt clearance and submit a comprehensive debt reorganization plan for approval.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has established five offices in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, including Ningbo, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou. Bureau Chief Peng Hu previously went to the respective offices in October and November of last year to understand the local shipping administration and shipping affairs situation and the overall implementation of policies, in order to promote shipping administration. He provided detailed guidance on matters that needed to be rectified and instructed them to improve. For matters related to reforms that need to be reviewed and approved by the Ministry, he selected key recommendations from the inspection report and submitted them to the Ministry for review and handling. As there are many matters requiring reform in various places, it is urgent to gather and discuss effective measures based on the recent situation of each office, and after presenting them for approval, to implement them with full mobilization in order to achieve the purpose of promoting shipping administration.

<h3 id="e133">The Effect of the Nanjing Road Business Community's Resistance to Abusive Stamp Duty Fines <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Since the replacement of new stamp duties last winter, the inspection of stamp duties in the concessions has suddenly led to incidents involving unwarranted and innocent cases. In particular, shops on Nanjing Road have been the most affected. For example, employee attendance books at the Huaying Pharmacy and duplicate sales reports at the Taikang Company have been fined 10 yuan per book, totaling a considerable amount. At the time, protests by relevant associations and the Nanjing Road Business Community United Association were ineffective. Subsequently, the Nanjing Road Southern United Association collected fourteen types of books and records that they believed should not require stamp duty and sent them to the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Consolidated Tax Bureau for identification. The Bureau has now replied, stating that five types have been approved for exemption and one type is ambiguous. The Association has issued a notice to its members accordingly. The original text reads: Respected Sirs, Regarding the protest against the excessive inspection of stamp duties in the concessions and the fines imposed on books and records that should not require stamp duty, this Association has collected fourteen types of books and records from several member shops that are believed to be exempt from stamp duty, as listed from A to D in the attached "Standard for Affixing Stamp Duty". Each book is numbered and a description and reason for exemption is provided. These were submitted to the Consolidated Tax Bureau Inspection Office for identification. The Bureau has forwarded the approval from the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance to the Association. We are now forwarding the attached sheet listing the standard for determining whether stamp duty should be affixed as specified in the original approval document for your reference. However, for clarity, the types that can be exempted are listed below: (1) Sign-in Book, (2) Book Cover of Invoice Stubs, (3) Attendance Record (this term is not common; it refers to a sign-in book with a form recording employee duty shifts), (4) Leave of Absence Book, (5) Payment Certificate (specifically for internal use by shops), (6) Material Issuance Record (this applies to clothing stores with custom-made clothing; since there are items such as "custom order", the approval requires stamp duty to be affixed according to regulations to prevent exploitation; if it is purely for internal material issuance, it can naturally be exempted). Furthermore, according to the official letter, the attached sheet has been instructed to be notified to the concession inspection offices for their information. If, in the future, the above-mentioned books and records that are exempt from stamp duty are inspected or detained, please politely refuse to present them based on this certificate. Sincerely, Shanghai Special First District Citizen First District Branch Nanjing Road Business Community United Association, issued February 15, 24th year of the Republic, with one attached sheet.</p>
<p>Standard for Affixing Stamp Duty (Approved by the Shanghai Consolidated Tax Inspection Office) A. Pharmacy Department, Sign-in Book: Determined to be unrelated, exempt from stamp duty. B. Accounting Department, Sign-in Book: Same as above. C. Invoice Stub Matching Book in the Receipting Department: Belongs to a type of business account, determined to be related to business, stamp duty should be affixed. D. Invoice Book: Since the invoice has already had stamp duty affixed, the book cover is exempt. E. Sample Mailing Book: Belongs to a type of business ledger, determined to be related to business, stamp duty should be affixed. F. Attendance Record: Determined to be unrelated to business, exempt from stamp duty. G. Goods Inspection Book: Belongs to a type of business ledger, determined to be related to business, stamp duty should be affixed. H. Ring and Line Ring Book: Determined to be the same in nature as the previous goods inspection book, stamp duty should be affixed. I. Leave of Absence Book: Determined to be unrelated to business, exempt from stamp duty. J. Payment Certificate: Should be exempt if it is definitely for internal use. K. Clothing Cutting Book: Belongs to a type of business ledger, determined to be related to business, stamp duty should be affixed. L. Custom Clothing Order Form: Determined to be the same in nature as a receipt for goods purchased on pre-order, stamp duty should be affixed to each form. M. Material Issuance Record: If this type of document is specifically for material issuance, then the custom clothing order form opened when the customer orders clothing must have the words "Amount Paid" and "Deposit Received". Why must this type of document also specify the amount of money? Fundamentally, it belongs to a type of custom clothing order form. In reality, it is not for internal material issuance. It should still follow the example of documents for pre-ordered goods and have stamp duty affixed to prevent exploitation. N. Daily Report Book: Resembles a running ledger, related to business, stamp duty should be affixed according to the example of loose-leaf ledgers.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Zhabei Civilian Education and Rehabilitation Center's First Step of Implementation Plan Successful <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Diligently and Earnestly Engaging in the Work</p>
<p>Self-Sufficiency and Self-Support Worthy of Admiration</p>
<p>Wang Guan Yi Resigns as Director</p>
<p>After the January 28 Incident, the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association, concerned about the concentration of vagrants in Zhabei as a hidden danger to the area, allocated 100,000 yuan from relief funds as a foundation. When the Shanghai Municipal Local Coordination Association was established, it continued to manage the center, first expanding new houses on the old site of the Liuying Road Vocational Training Center in Zhabei. It was completed in the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic and transferred more than 100 civilians from places such as the South Shanghai Chronic Illness Center for education and rehabilitation, with equal emphasis on work and training. Later, due to various reasons, the management was formally entrusted to the China Children's Welfare Association on August 1st of the 23rd year of the Republic, with a contract period of two years. The Association's Secretary-General Xu Jianping sought approval from Chairman Kong Xiangxi to select and dispatch Wang Guan Yi to take over and organize the center in advance. Subsequently, the Association's Executive Committee formally appointed Wang Guan Yi as Director. Following Chairman Kong's instructions, Wang Guan Yi focused on scientific management and production development to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency and self-support. Director Wang, with a spirit of practical experimentation and hard work, worked to complete this mission, and sought guidance from the directors of the Local Coordination Association, such as Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Binyan, Zhang Xiaoliang, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Wenyu, and Hu Yunqiu, as well as support from people in the community, the center's Management Committee members Ding Shujing, Lin Kanghou, and Li Tingan, and assistance from the Association's Secretary-General Xu and colleagues. As a result, the first step of the center's self-sufficiency and self-support implementation plan was successful. To clarify the facts and encourage observation, the main points are explored below: (1) Emerging industries and expansion of existing industrial and agricultural sectors, (1) Ping An Chicken Farm, using the center's strip of land, selecting residents, and managing it with scientific methods and economic management, (2) China Stone Company, the only domestic natural stone company in China, with the enthusiastic support of the company, has reportedly transferred a portion of its simple work to the center, and no fewer than 20 residents are learning this craft, (2) Paper Box Factory, in addition to manufacturing mosquito coil boxes for the China Chemical Industry Society, has also received approval from Mr. Hou of Fuxin Tobacco Company to manufacture all the paper boxes for the factory's Holmes cigarettes, so the factory's income has also increased accordingly, (4) Laundry Department, originally established to wash the clothes of the center's staff and workers, is now also washing clothes for the Guanzhen Restaurant on Sichuan Road and the Association's Children's Welfare Clinic on Baoshan Road, so it has improved its washing techniques and increased its income, (5) Farm Animal Husbandry, comprehensively reformed, vegetable production, in addition to supplying the center, is also sold to the Buddhist Children's Welfare Home, the Association's Tangshan Road Education and Rehabilitation Center, and nearby restaurants, etc., with considerable monthly income, animal husbandry, in addition to the previously raised pigs and sheep, which are sold during the lunar New Year, now also includes goats, pigs, etc., (2) Economic situation, the center's economic sources, in addition to the local Coordination Association's monthly allocation of 600 yuan from the foundation's interest, the Association's monthly provision of 400 yuan in subsidies (a six-month trial period is full, subsidies stop after the period). The center's director, with the importance of the mission of self-sufficiency and self-support, and with the determination to achieve nothing less than success, immediately reduced expenditures from one side and increased revenue from the other side, such as the above-mentioned improvement of the industrial and agricultural sectors, which increased production. In the first month, expenses were reduced by more than one-third compared to the past. Up to now (a total of six months), the center's operating expenses, in addition to the local Coordination Association's allocation of foundation interest and designated donations, the Association's monthly subsidy has been used for only a few dozen yuan. Therefore, the first step of the center's plan has indeed been successful, and future progress will be even more limitless. (3) Education and rehabilitation methods (emphasis on conversion) (1) Physical training, focusing on military training and recreational activities, so that each resident has balanced health development and can undertake various daily tasks, (2) Use of hands and feet, enriching the original factories and farms, and improving them so that each resident's hands and feet learn considerable skills and create self-reliant talents, (3) Development of the brain, focusing on the input of knowledge, teaching the characters needed for daily life, simple science, and common civic knowledge, (4) Broadening of knowledge, so that the residents' sight, hearing, and feeling, as much as possible, go to see and hear, and make contact in person. Therefore, the center focuses on travel, visits, autonomous gatherings, film education, etc., such as visiting American warships, visiting the Municipal Government, visiting exhibitions, and admiring famous gardens, all to reduce the narrow-minded attitude of being surprised by the unfamiliar and to promote their bright and upright thinking, (5) Correction of bad habits, in addition to daily education, the formation of public and private morality is carefully arranged in the environment, personal contact, and joint discipline, with the aim of purifying their inferior nature invisibly. The center's ability to achieve self-sufficiency in a short period of time, without relying on assistance, is a model for children's welfare institutions across the country. At the same time, the center has abundant development potential in its environment. If it continues to work hard in this way, it will not be difficult to use the unlimited environment to complete a greater mission.</p>
<p>It has also been learned that Director Wang, due to the numerous duties within the association, is unable to take care of everything, and that all matters within the center are on track, with economic independence having been achieved, and that the time is right for him to resign and hand over his position to a more capable person. He has submitted his resignation, so the center's Management Committee has separately sought out talent and submitted it to the Executive Committee for appointment and replacement.</p>

<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the cargo handling employees of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at various ports on the Yangtze and along the coast are requesting increased wages due to the meager compensation offered by the company. Employees of Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire, which also employ cargo handlers, have already received wage increases. Therefore, in June of last year, they petitioned the Chinese Seamen's Union for negotiation. After repeated discussions by the union and the China Navigation Mutual Aid Association, a group of compradores, no resolution was reached. The union has therefore decided to negotiate directly with the company. It has been decided that Secretary Zhao Banfu will be dispatched to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company this Monday (the 18th) morning for direct negotiations.</p>

<p>Approved by Order of the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Last year, Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces experienced drought, and agricultural yields were sharply reduced. To regulate the people's food supply, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau petitioned the municipal government to purchase long-term foreign rice. At the same time, financial institutions and rice merchants also ordered foreign rice from Saigon, Rangoon, and other locations, to be shipped to China in installments. Now, the bureau believes that the total amount of foreign rice registered for import has reached 6,235,000 bags, equivalent to 623,500 tons, and the market is already glutted with foreign rice. Therefore, there is no need to order more long-term foreign rice. It has specially requested the municipal government to approve a postponement, which has been approved by order.</p>

Subsequently, the team dispatched officers to search Yan Shijin's home and discovered a gun, several bullets, and reactionary leaflets inside a baby's cradle. They were immediately taken to the battalion headquarters for interrogation. Yan and the others all claimed complete ignorance. The officers presiding over the case saw that Yan and the others' statements were sincere and did not seem like those of reactionaries, fearing that there might be other circumstances involved.

<p>Wen Previously Illegally Detained by the Japanese</p>
<p>Also Suspected of Aiding Drug Manufacturing</p>
<p>Detectives stationed by the Lao Zha Police Department at the residence of Chen Zongchang, the main criminal of the Zunde Lane opium den at 21 Xiejiao Road, apprehended Yue native Wen Zong'e at approximately 11:00 AM the day before yesterday and brought him back to the police station. Wen stated that he resides at No. 8 Huanlong Lane, Longhuan Lane, is a graduate of Meiji University in Japan, and is currently a staff member of the Seventh District of the Consolidated Tax Bureau. He claimed that his visit to Chen's residence was because Chen had privately imported Japanese-made cigarette paper and evaded taxes, so he was investigating. The detectives accompanied him to the Consolidated Tax Bureau for investigation, where a Mr. Wang, a senior official, identified him as an employee of the bureau but stated that he had not been dispatched to Chen's residence for investigation. The detectives, believing that Wen's statement was untrue, took him back to the police station. Wen then claimed that in addition to his position at the Consolidated Tax Bureau, he also held a position at the Nichijitsu Hibi (transliteration) Foreign Firm and was there on behalf of the foreign firm to collect payment for cigarette paper from Chen Zonglian. After investigation by the detectives, it was learned that Chen indeed had a debt dispute with the foreign firm. Recently, Chen was illegally detained by the Japanese in a certain area of Hongkou, and Wen threatened Chen with a gun at the time, resulting in his arrest. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. Police attorney Wang Yaotang explained the situation and stated that in addition to being suspected of aiding in the manufacture of heroin, the defendant was also guilty of obstructing freedom and requested permission to detain him for joint trial with Chen Zongchang, Tang Jiejun, and others. Judge Feng Bozhang briefly questioned him and ordered him detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Record of the Opening of the Wang Boying Kidnapping Case Trial <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Police Attorney Detailed the Kidnapping and Case-Solving Process</p>
<p>Victim Injured and Unable to Attend, Four Kidnappers Detained Pending Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Wang Boying (also known as Boyin), the manager of the Damai Qianzhuang and director of the Dadong Bookstore, a Shaoxing native, was kidnapped on the night of the 9th of this month at 11:40 PM along with his concubine, Madam Wang Li, while riding in his private car, number 5321. As soon as they reached the entrance of Lane 102, Changfeng Lane, on Tongfu Road, they encountered three kidnappers, two men and one woman, who boarded the car with weapons, forced out Madam Li, and drove Wang and the car away. They sent a letter to the family demanding a ransom of 200,000 yuan, a truly shocking amount. After Wang's family reported the incident to the police, the Chengdu Road Police Department, led by Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, Detectives Cui Chengke and Yang Xinzheng, Senior Detectives Huang Fuson and Xu Dezhong, and Western Detectives, apprehended the kidnapper Wang Liugen, a local, and his suspected accomplice, Wang Cai, in room 201 of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street. They confiscated a handgun. Based on Wang's confession, they, along with detectives from the French Concession Police Department, went to the hideout at No. 14 Rongfu Lane, Xiai Ansi Road, to arrest accomplices. Yao Maoqing, the kidnapper guarding the victim, refused to open the door and was shot and killed by the detectives. Stray bullets injured Wang Boying's arm, and the victim was rescued. They also confiscated a Mauser pistol. They then went to room 306 of the Dazhong Hotel and apprehended Yang Kong, Wang's nanny, a Liyang native, and Wang's three-year-old son. They also apprehended Zhang Zhengguo, a Yangzhou native, an accomplice, at the intersection of Yapei Road and Fuxu Road. The body of the deceased was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination by the Second Special District Court, and the other four kidnappers, along with the weapons, were returned to the police station and detained separately. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police sent the four kidnappers to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, where Judge Liu Yugui presided over the interrogation. The defendant Zhang Zhengguo hired lawyer Wu Linkun for his defense. The details of the trial are recorded below.</p>
<p>Details of the Kidnapping</p>
<p>Police attorney Zhang Tianyin began by detailing the events, stating that the victim, Wang Boying, resides at No. 3 Guiren Lane, Lane 195, Maigen Road, and is a director of the Dadong Bookstore. His concubine, Madam Li, resides at No. 19, Changfeng Lane, Lane 102, Tongfu Road. On the evening of the 9th of this month, Wang had dinner at his concubine's residence. At approximately 7:00 PM, he telephoned his wife's residence and asked her to have the car driven over. The car's number was 5321. At 11:00 PM, Wang and his concubine, Madam Li, boarded the car to go to a friend surnamed Zhang on Baker Road. As the car left the lane entrance, a kidnapper (the deceased) stood in front of the car and was almost run over. Wang scolded the driver for being careless.</p>
<p>Ransom of 200,000</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in a flash, the kidnapper and another kidnapper (Wang Liugen) boarded the car from either side, threatening them with handguns. They forced Madam Li out, and another female kidnapper (Wang Cai) also boarded the car. The deceased and Wang Cai sat on either side of Wang, and the kidnappers watched the driver and drove the car forward at high speed. When they reached Lafayette Road and Muirhead Road, they drove the driver out of the car and drove west, disappearing without a trace. Later, Wang's family reported the incident to the police. On the 11th, they received a letter from the kidnappers, which included a letter written by the victim himself, asking his parents to raise funds. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of 200,000 yuan. The kidnappers learned that Yin Zhibai, who lived at No. 9 Guiren Lane, was a person who could help, so they sent the letter directly to Yin.</p>
<p>Negotiations</p>
<p>On the 13th, Wang Gumei, who lived at No. 10 Guiren Lane, also received a letter from the victim, also asking her to help. She reported the letter to the police, and Wang's family sent representatives, Xiao Chan, along with Detectives Cui Chengke and Huang Fuson, to negotiate with the kidnappers. They agreed to meet at 10:00 AM yesterday morning in room 201 of the Dafang Hotel to negotiate. At noon yesterday, the Chinese and Western detectives apprehended Wang Liugen and Wang Cai in the room. They found a handgun and nine bullets on Wang Cai's person. The room was registered under Wang Cai's name, who was using the alias He Xiuying. Later, at room 306 of the Dazhong Hotel, they apprehended Yang Kong and the three-year-old boy. Yang Kong claimed that she was employed by Wang as a nanny and that the child was Wang's son.</p>
<p>A Fierce Gunfight</p>
<p>Later, Wang and his wife revealed that the victim was being held at No. 14 Rongfu Lane, Lane 8, Xiai Ansi Road. The police accompanied Wang Liugen to the hideout. Wang called out at the back door, and the kidnapper inside (the deceased) opened the door upon hearing the voice. When the kidnapper saw the detectives, he knew that he had been exposed and immediately opened fire, shooting at Western Detective Gai Zilai who was nearby. Fortunately, he missed. Another Western Detective Bai Langlin and Chinese Detective Huang Fuson immediately drew their guns and returned fire. The kidnapper, Yao Maoqing, was hit by two bullets and fell dead in the kitchen. A handgun was found near his body, containing six bullets. The body has been sent to Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await examination.</p>
<p>Victim Hit by Bullets</p>
<p>During the gunfight, the victim heard the commotion in the pavilion upstairs and climbed out of the window. However, detective Ye Dezhong did not recognize him as the victim and mistook him for an accomplice, firing six shots at him, unfortunately hitting his right arm. He has been sent to the hospital and is expected to recover in ten days, according to doctors. The detectives then entered the room and found a Mauser pistol and nine bullets inside the bed in the front building. They also found more than 200 bullets, two pairs of sunglasses, and an envelope under the bed. The handwriting on the envelope was identical to that on the letters received by Wang's family, indicating that it was written by the deceased. All the kidnappers were then taken back to the police station.</p>
<p>Discussing the Kidnapping</p>
<p>Wang confessed that Zhang Zhengguo initiated the plan. Zhang was arrested at 6:05 PM yesterday afternoon in front of the Xintong Automobile Company on Albert Road and Fuxu Road. The victim, Wang Boying, was unable to attend due to his injuries. His representatives, Chan and the driver, Cifu Tang, were present for questioning. Judge Liu questioned each defendant separately, starting with Wang Liugen. Wang Liugen confessed that he used to run the Dakang Automobile Company, so he knew how to drive. In December of last year, because he was in debt, he discussed a plan with Zhang Zhengguo at the Dacheng Apartments. Zhang mentioned that Wang Boying had repeatedly hired cars from Dakang, so he knew him and knew that Wang's family was wealthy and had potential for being kidnapped, so why not give it a try.</p>
<p>Details of the Execution</p>
<p>The next day, they rented the Dafang Hotel to continue their discussions. In addition to Wang and Zhang, the deceased Yao Maoqing was also present. They decided to carry out the kidnapping. However, because they lacked weapons, Yao volunteered to find them, as Yao had previously worked in the military and could easily obtain them. They then dispersed. Later, Yao brought a Mauser pistol and two handguns (those confiscated) and set the date for February 9th to take action. Zhang and Wang rented the hideout in advance to hide the victim, paying 90 yuan as a deposit and 25 yuan per month for rent. On the 9th, Wang, his wife Cai, and Yao went to wait on the street corner. Zhang did not go because he knew the victim. At 11:00 PM, the victim came out, and they approached him. Yao dragged the concubine out, and Wang held a gun to watch the driver.</p>
<p>Driven to the Hideout</p>
<p>Because he needed both hands to drive, he could not hold the gun and handed it over to Yao. Yao held the gun with both hands, with his wife sitting on the right and Wang Cai on the left. He drove the car straight to Rongfu Lane. Zhang came once that night, asked if the person had been brought, and then left. Wang and Yao were responsible for guarding the victim. The next day, Yao sent a letter to Wang's family demanding a ransom of 200,000 yuan. This ransom had been discussed in advance. Yang Kong was a female servant, and because it was inconvenient for her to live with them, she was placed in the Dazhong Hotel.</p>
<p>Framed Accusation</p>
<p>Zhang Zhengguo stated that the Dakang Automobile Company was opened by his father, and Wang Liugen's brother was a shareholder in the company. He introduced Wang to the company, first as a driver and then to help with bookkeeping. On May 22nd of last year, Wang Liugen forged a seal and fraudulently withdrew 5,474 yuan from the Shanghai Bank, fleeing with Cai. He reported this to the Gordon Road Police Department the next day and posted a reward notice. His lawyer, Wu Linkun, presented the newspaper and the police warrant. He continued, stating that in addition to being the junior proprietor of Dakang, he also worked as a sales representative for the Xintong Automobile Company and was a legitimate businessman. How could he be involved in this kidnapping? He was being framed by Wang Liugen, whom he was currently wanted by police.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Waited</p>
<p>Wang Cai confessed that she and Wang Liugen were lovers. Because Wang had embezzled more than 5,000 yuan from the company and could not make it up, they fled to Wuxi to avoid trouble. They lived next door to Yao Maoqing, which is how they met. When they came to Shanghai, they lived in the Dacheng Apartments. In December of last year, she heard Wang say that he had agreed with Zhang Zhengguo to carry out a kidnapping and rented the house at No. 14 Rongfu Lane. Wang paid the rent. The handguns were brought by Yao. Wang and Yao had repeatedly waited on Tongfu Road.</p>
<p>Detained Pending Further Interrogation</p>
<p>On that day, she was asked by Yao to go with him, saying, "Don't be afraid, the victim doesn't have a gun, so come with us." She went along just to observe. Unexpectedly, they took action that day. Yao stood in front of the car and dragged out the victim's concubine, sitting on either side of the victim with her. She did not hold a gun. Her husband was the driver and took the victim to Rongfu Lane. Yao was responsible for guarding. She had been there several times and acted as a guard once. Yang Kong confessed that she was a nanny and knew nothing about the kidnapping. Wang Liugen stated that Zhang was indeed an accomplice and was not being framed. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confessions and ordered that all the defendants be detained for seven days for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Examination of the Deceased Kidnapper</p>
<p>According to a report from the French Concession Constable, Wang Boyin, a native of Shaoxing residing at No. 17 Changfeng Lane, Tongfu Road, in the Public Concession, was kidnapped on the night of the 9th of this month and hidden in the hideout at No. 14 Rongfu Lane, Xiai Ansi Road, in the French Concession, and a large ransom was demanded. Yesterday morning, the Chengdu Road Police Department received a telephone tip that the kidnappers were negotiating the ransom at the Dafang Hotel, room 201, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives, along with the French Concession Police, to apprehend two men and one woman (one of the men was the victim's representative). They also apprehended one man and one woman at the Dazhong Hotel across the street. They learned the location of the hideout and immediately rushed to rescue the victim. At that time, Yao Maoqing (25 years old), the kidnapper guarding the victim, opened fire and resisted arrest and was killed by the detectives on the spot. Details have already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan of the Second Special Court, along with medical examiner Jiang Dan and clerk Peng Ying, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body of the deceased kidnapper Yao Maoqing. One gunshot wound was found on his chest and another on his back, piercing through to the right side and the left knee. One shot hit his right hand, piercing through the palm, breaking his index finger and thumb. The medical examiner extracted one six-inch bullet each from the left side, left knee, and calf. After the examination, they took their seats. French Concession Police Constable Zhang Chunsheng reported the case. Western Detective Bao Langlige (transliteration) of the Chengdu Road Police Department testified that after they apprehended the kidnappers at the Dafang Hotel, they learned the location of the hideout and went to rescue the victim. When they arrived at the back door of the hideout, a detective knocked on the door. The deceased opened the door, and a Western detective rushed in. The deceased immediately fired two or three shots from his handgun, and he fired two shots in retaliation, and the deceased fell to the ground. Another detective fired two shots and the deceased died on the spot. They confiscated the handgun he was holding and a Mauser pistol from the bed upstairs. The female kidnapper apprehended at the Dafang Hotel also had a handgun. He requested permission to take back the bullets extracted from the body for further investigation. Chief Chen reviewed the testimony and stated that Yao Maoqing had died from gunshot wounds sustained during his lifetime and that the body could not be claimed. The two bullets extracted from the body were handed over to Western Detective Bao Langlige to be taken to the police station for further investigation. After the examination, the police took photos of the body and then sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial in coffin number 3065 in Pudong.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Group Wedding Stipulates Formal Attire Style <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Certificate Application Deadline Extended</p>
<p>The group wedding organized by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, after being approved by the municipal government, is being actively prepared, and the work is extremely intense. The first wedding on April 3rd is fast approaching, so the number of people applying to register with the bureau has been very enthusiastic. The day of the ceremony is sure to be a grand occasion. Now, for the sake of uniformity, the bureau has stipulated the style of formal attire for the group wedding. The groom will wear a blue robe and a black mandarin jacket, and the bride will wear a imperial-pink cheongsam. They have already reached an agreement with the local Meiya Silk Weaving Factory to have them produce the material for the formal attire, which is made of real silk. The stipulated price for the Class A men's formal robe and jacket material is 15 yuan, and the Class B is 12 yuan. The Class A women's is five yuan, and the Class B is four yuan and two corners. The prices are all uniform. The materials will be woven by the 10th of next month. All those participating in the group wedding must wear the formal attire made by the factory. However, those who are poor and unable to afford the silk material for the formal attire can use cloth, but they must obtain the color of the formal attire from the bureau and make it in the same style to be qualified. The veil must also be rented from the factory, with a rental fee of one yuan and five corners per piece. The price of the formal attire material is stipulated to be so low to conform to the original intention of promoting economy in group weddings. In addition, the deadline for the submission of certificate styles has been formally extended to March 5th due to the fact that many of the submissions received were not suitable. The results of the solicitation will be announced on March 10th, and letters will be sent to art schools in Shanghai and other places to solicit suitable certificate styles, and generous compensation will be given. The responsible person in charge of the preparations for the event stated that there is no limit to the number of people participating in the wedding, but it will be limited to the maximum capacity of the municipal government auditorium.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Activities of the Public Works Department's Sanitation Division <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Disease Prevention: Disinfection: Pest Control: Vaccination</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's Sanitation Division's activities include investigation and disinfection of infectious diseases, certification and registration of Chinese deaths, vaccination, cholera immunization, mosquito and fly control, plague prevention, inspection of licensed and other premises, investigation and handling of resident complaints, and management of public swimming pools.</p>
<p>Number of Vaccinations</p>
<p>The division administered 264,450 vaccinations last year (compared to only 181,402 in the previous year), of which 58,069 were Chinese infants or first-time vaccinators. In addition, 72,378 adults and 128,158 children were revaccinated. 3,845 foreigners were vaccinated.</p>
<p>Disease Prevention Immunization</p>
<p>During the summer, the immunization car administered 249,106 cholera immunizations. From the end of June to October, well water was disinfected with chlorine gas every week. In addition, the Waterworks Company provided free clean water to poor residents in the East and West districts, totaling 1.8 million gallons.</p>
<p>Mosquito Control</p>
<p>Mosquito control activities include house-to-house inspections, drainage of waterways, leveling of land, and application of oil to water surfaces. In addition, mosquito larvae were collected and sent to the laboratory for testing and verification. However, there is still no effective method for eliminating mosquitoes breeding in the water accumulated in the foundations of large buildings.</p>
<p>Fly Control</p>
<p>Fly control activities were carried out throughout the concession. Boric acid water was used to disinfect garbage piles. Last year, boric acid disinfection was also applied to garbage cans. In addition, fly swatting teams were dispatched from time to time to swat flies.</p>
<p>Swimming Pool</p>
<p>The admission price for the swimming pool was slightly increased last year, but the number of swimmers still exceeded 105,708 (compared to 12,140 in the previous year). The increased fee slightly reduced overcrowding and restricted undesirable elements. During the hottest period, the pool was open until 10:00 PM every day.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Statement by Butterfield &amp; Swire Regarding Security Precautions <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that Butterfield &amp; Swire issued a public notice yesterday (the 14th), stating that as a result of the investigation into the Tongzhou steamboat robbery case, several decisions have been made. First and foremost, it must be stated that the ships built for the company's inland waterway shipping operations were not designed with the specific anti-piracy features, such as protective iron railings, found on vessels operated by Butterfield &amp; Swire in South China, where piracy is prevalent. The company is now carefully studying how to modify the interiors of ships specifically built for North China's waterways to address the piracy problem. However, it is essential to understand that the possible alterations or improvements are limited. One primary concern is that installing railings could endanger lives. This is not an overestimation, as evidenced by the case of the Liangguang (transliteration) steamboat that sank in the Gapu Water Gate (transliteration) sea channel in 1927, resulting in 135 deaths. According to the Hong Kong court coroner's inquest at the time, passengers were trapped inside the ship like rats in a rat trap, with no way to escape. In addition to studying internal modifications to the ships, Butterfield &amp; Swire is considering and implementing other possible and convenient precautions that it has in mind or that have been suggested by the public. These include: (1) Increasing the strength of armed guards by 50%; (2) Changing the weaponry to weapons that can be used more quickly. While the Mauser pistols currently carried by the guards are undoubtedly excellent, experts believe they cannot be deployed quickly enough in an emergency. New weapons would avoid this problem; (3) Searching passengers and their luggage in each cabin before the ship weighs anchor. This search will be conducted in cooperation with the responsible authorities. It should be noted that company inspectors, both Chinese and foreign, have been conducting searches on ships for the past few years, but body searches have often angered passengers. It is now hoped that passengers can be persuaded to comply with these searches for their own benefit; (4) The ships of the two British companies operating coastal shipping in North China have begun to communicate with each other by wireless telegraphy, and the area is being managed in accordance with the British Navy's guidance in the southern piracy zone between Xiamen and Singapore. Although the intention of this measure is to enable ships to issue warnings early in case of emergencies, the primary purpose is to prevent piracy.</p>
<h3 id="e147">### Robbery Foiled, Handgun Stolen <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Rent Collector Encountered Robbers in Pingheli</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 11:00 AM, a landlord surnamed Mou from Pingheli, Aveneu Road sent a clerk and a bodyguard to Pingheli to collect rent. As they were leaving number 40 in the neighborhood, four robbers suddenly appeared from behind, each carrying a handgun. They shouted at the rent collector and his clerk to stop. The bodyguard was also grabbed around the waist and unable to move. His personal handgun was also taken away. While they were struggling, Guard No. 137 from the neighborhood security office learned of the incident, and rushed to the scene with a gun. Seeing that things were not going well, the robbers did not wait to rob the money and fled in different directions, firing two shots into the air as a warning. Afterward, the guard and the bodyguard, realizing that although the money had not been robbed, the gun had fallen into the robbers' hands, went together to report to the police station in charge of the area, requesting that the robbers be apprehended.</p>
<h3 id="e148">### Rickshaw Puller Robbed Intoxicated American <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Over One Hundred Silver Dollars Stolen</p>
<p>Three Rickshaw Pullers Have Been Detained</p>
<p>An American man named Paulson, who works as a doctor on an American merchant ship, hired a rickshaw at approximately 3:00 AM on the first of this month. While traveling near Zhoushan Road and Huade Road, he was robbed by several rickshaw pullers who took advantage of his intoxication to steal a diary containing over one hundred silver dollars, worth 340 yuan, and fled without a trace. The case was reported to the Hongkou Police Station. The day before yesterday, Detective Wang Runhe received a tip from an informant and arrested three Jiangbei natives (rickshaw pullers) Chen Deshun, Wang Dingtai, and Gu Hongsheng at 122 East Broadway Road, West Huade Road, and Zhangjiaqiao in Zhabei. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The lawyer Li Zhishan of the Municipal Council recounted the events, stating that the victim, Paulson, was unable to appear in court because the ship left Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd, bound for the United States. The defendants admitted at the police station that a rickshaw puller named Xiao Wang had initiated the robbery. However, they claimed that only twenty silver dollars were taken. He asked for the case to be postponed. When questioned, Chen Deshun and Wang Dingtai confessed that they each received five yuan (silver dollars) after the fact. Gu Hongsheng confessed that he received 1.60 yuan. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that they remain in custody and set a new date for review.</p>
<h3 id="e149">### Setting Up a Anti-Drug Society to Collect Money: Huang Jiemin Approved for Transfer <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Police Believe the Case Involves Aiding and Abetting</p>
<p>Yesterday, He Declared Abandonment of Appeal</p>
<p>Huang Jiemin from Suzhou took advantage of the authorities' strict anti-smoking campaign last year and founded the China Anti-Drug Society, establishing a national headquarters at No. 8, Sanrui Lane, Tongfu Road. He drafted a simple constitution, declaration, and fee schedule, and then went to various places to recruit people into the society as members, and instructed members to organize branch offices in various counties, districts, and townships, using the name to deceive and collect money. Although the party and government agencies successively rejected the application for registration, he still continued his activities. Recently, the Nanchang branch of the Military Affairs Commission learned that Huang Zhan dared to create a new name to swindle and cheat, and strictly ordered the local military and political authorities to instruct the Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrest him quickly. The bureau had already joined forces with the Chengdu Road Police Station to arrest Huang, along with various printed materials, seals, books, certificates, and other items, and sent them to the First Special District Court. After questioning, Huang was suspected of fraud. The court ruled to transfer him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning. However, during the appeal period, he was temporarily detained at the police station. The relevant details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the Municipal Police Department has conducted a detailed study of Huang's actions by the legal team of the Municipal Council, and has determined that since it is a case of aiding and abetting, there should be no objection. Yesterday, the lawyer in charge formally declared to the court that he would abandon the appeal, and carried out the ruling. At the same time, he notified Lawyer Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to forward the request to Director Wen, asking him to send the original investigator to the detention center to bring Huang Jiemin and the evidence back to be investigated and handled.</p>

<p>Chen Xu, a woman from No. 2 Yuyuan Lane, Xingjia Wooden Bridge, Zhabei, roasted two dead male and female infants on a tile and burned them into ashes, claiming that they could cure tuberculosis. The police station in that area learned about it and ordered the police to send the woman, along with the two dead children, to the local court for questioning.

<h3 id="e152">### Yi Fangshuo's Appeal Results in Three-Year Sentence <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Request for Bail Denied</p>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a native of Hangzhou who performed slapstick comedy at the New Company's rooftop playground, was accused of raping his cousin Yi Baozhu and his aunt Li Xiaozhen. The French Concession police arrested Yi. Later, Yi was found to have also committed the crime of buying women, Ye Jinzhu and Yang Lingzhu, and others, and making them learn drama and monitoring their actions. He was sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution on three counts of obstructing morals, family, and freedom. During the trial, the victims withdrew their charges for obstructing morals. The court proceeded with the trial on the two counts of obstructing family and freedom. As a result, Yi Fangshuo was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for illegally depriving people of their freedom of movement. He was found not guilty of obstructing family. During the appeal period, he was transferred to the detention center to await instructions. Yi refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Branch Court. The High Court, based on the petition, held a collegial hearing on the 8th of this month, summoned witnesses for interrogation, and announced the end of the debate, pending judgment. All the details have been recorded in the newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the date for the verdict arrived. Yi's defense lawyers Sha Xunyi and Lou Yunmei arrived at the court one after another at 2:00 PM to await instructions. Yi's wives, Yi Meimei, Yi's sisters, Yi Caitao, and relatives also arrived at the court to listen. At three o'clock, Judge Guo Dezhang, together with Assessors Sun Honglin and Jia Liang, Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, and Clerk Huang Lixiang, specially opened the Third Criminal Court to announce the verdict. Lawyer Gu Shouxi represented the Police Department and appeared in court. The two defense lawyers, Sha and Lou, also appeared in court to await the verdict. The court ordered the bailiffs to bring the appellant Yi Fangshuo from the detention center for questioning. After briefly questioning his age and origin, Judge Guo announced the main text of the verdict, that the original verdict was revoked, and that Yi Fangshuo was sentenced to one day of imprisonment for every two days of illegal detention of another person, and that he was sentenced to three years of imprisonment. After the verdict was announced, the judge briefly explained the reasons for the decision to the appellant, stating that he acknowledged that Yi had confessed that Ye Jinzhu was a maid of the Ye family, who was bought by Yi for 150 yuan to learn drama, and that he had monitored their actions. Although Ye Lishi testified in court that some had entrusted him with guardianship and some had not entrusted him with guardianship, the original trial's verdict that he had illegally deprived them of their freedom was inappropriate. Therefore, this court changed the sentence to three years of imprisonment in accordance with Article 313 of the Criminal Law, which ranges from one year to seven years of imprisonment. If he was not satisfied, he could file an appeal with the Supreme Court to this court after receiving the judgment. He was also instructed that Yi's wife, Yi Lishi, should file a petition with this court, requesting a stay of detention, on the grounds that Yi was seriously ill. This court has been handling the case until now. After observing Yi's body, there was no sign of illness. Therefore, the ruling to reject the request was made. Yi's lawyer again requested that bail be allowed during the appeal period. The court did not allow it. After the order was given, the police were ordered to take Yi down and return him to the detention center. Yi and his wives and concubines all left with tears and dismay, quickly leaving.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Cat Skin and Fox Skin Listed as Special Light and Bulky Goods <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Two-Road Administration received instructions from the Ministry of Railways, stating that the Ping Sui Railway Administration telegraphed in December of the 23rd year, and the agency telegraphed No. 51 on the shimmering day of January of this year, stating that fur is a major commodity transported by the railway. It has always been charged as ordinary light and bulky goods. However, the volume per kilogram of this type of goods has actually exceeded four cubic decimeters. According to the charges for ordinary light and bulky goods, the burden on the merchants is too heavy. It is proposed to include all kinds of furs, except for wet hides, in the special light and bulky goods list, and collect freight at the rate of four cubic decimeters equivalent to one kilogram to reduce the burden on the merchants, etc., and attach a survey table of the volume and packaging of dry hides. According to this, after checking the various dry furs listed in the survey table, the degree of lightness and bulkiness varies. The current eleven items of overly light and bulky animal skin, cat skin, dog skin, sheep skin, fox skin, rabbit skin, gray mouse skin, wolf skin, leopard skin, marmot skin, and tiger skin are added to the list of special light and bulky goods and will be implemented from the 21st of this month.

<h3 id="e156">Dr. Tang Jiazhen Announces the Principle of Egg Yolk Lecithin for Smoking Cessation <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dr. Tang Jiazhen announced the principle of egg lecithin for smoking cessation, saying that since Dr. Ma Wenzhao invented egg lecithin for smoking cessation, the Department of Health has adopted it to make smoking cessation medicines, which can be stopped immediately after smoking, without any pain, and the efficacy is remarkable and widely praised. The theory and principles of Dr. Ma are often scattered in various newspapers and magazines, but they are incomplete and not detailed enough, so that the general public cannot understand them. What we want to know is (1) the efficacy of egg yolk lecithin in smoking cessation, based on what kind of theory, (2) whether egg yolk lecithin is exclusively a smoking cessation medicine. According to Dr. Ma's years of research, the cells of human tissue contain a main part called the "Golgi body." This chemical component is a lipid, that is, egg yolk lecithin, etc. When the "Golgi body" in the cell increases, the person's spirit is invigorated, thoughts are renewed, and the limbs are used happily. Otherwise, the body is tired, the spirit is depressed, the whole body is sore and lazy, and there is no vitality. The function of opium is to stimulate the red blood cells in the blood to produce a large number of "platelets." The elements contained in platelets are nothing but lipids. Several kinds of white blood cells in the blood take this substance and transfer it to various organs, and the cells of each organ get this lipid, that is, to manufacture the "Golgi body" in its body. From this point of view, the Golgi body increased by opium is completely produced by its stimulating effect. After smoking for a long time, this kind of lipid cannot function without the power of opium. Therefore, when the opium addiction occurs, the number of platelets is greatly reduced, and the white blood cells stagnate in the blood vessels, not doing transportation work, and the cells of various organs naturally have no way to absorb this kind of lipid. As a result, the number of Golgi bodies that are originally there is greatly reduced or completely disappears, and all kinds of uneasy states appear, which is the so-called outbreak of smoking addiction. Egg yolk lecithin is a great tonic, and it is especially effective for smoking cessation in cases of neurasthenia and pulmonary tuberculosis. The reason is that its components are similar to the elements contained in platelets, because they are both lipids. After taking this element, white blood cells can directly take lipids from the intestines and send them to the cells of various organs. After the cells obtain this large amount of lipids and new troops, they can carry out their normal work, and they do not need to take it indirectly from red blood cells, so red blood cells can get rest and increase their effectiveness. During the period when we take egg lecithin, the Golgi body can directly take lipids from the intestine to increase its number, so we can get rid of the control of opium. Once the opium is reduced or even abandoned, the Golgi body is not in danger of disappearing because it has sufficient egg lecithin as its backing, and the purpose of physiological smoking cessation is achieved. Egg yolk lecithin can be obtained from three kinds of substances, one is animal brain, and the second is egg yolk lecithin in egg yolk, which Dr. Ma also believes is the best. According to the results of many scholars' experiments, egg lecithin is indeed a powerful tonic, as mentioned above. Even people who are not addicted to smoking can freely take it. Naturally, their weight will increase, their thinking will be quick, their complexion will be radiant, and there will be absolutely no elemental or any side effects. Therefore, egg lecithin is not only a smoking cessation product, but also an important tonic.</p>

We admire your being a Lu Zhonglian in the case of Shangxiantang Women's and Children's Hospital. However, the settlement has been delayed because both parties are unwilling to pay the newspaper fee.

We are willing to donate money for newspaper advertising and be a mediator after the public is made aware of the situation. I hope you will agree and send down the newspaper draft so that it can be sent to various newspapers. Respectfully, Xiong Xiling and Zhu Qinglan, February 14.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry is Allowed to Patent for Five Years</p>
<p>A manufacturing factory will be established in Shanghai</p>
<p>Xi Pingzhu, a local industrial expert, has seen that our country's industry and commerce are backward, and the annual trade deficit is alarming, resulting in the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the depletion of people's livelihoods. In order to save rights and interests, he has invented a kind of cultural stove based on his research to resist foreign electric stoves. The outer shell of the stove is made of enamel. There is a stove hole on the upper left end, which can be used to put a pot for cooking. Below it is the stove door for lighting and extinguishing the fire. The edge of the stove hole is a water tank, which is connected to the right end with a tube. The steam is used to steam rice and stir-fry vegetables, so that rice, vegetables and other things can be completed at the same time. Each meal only costs one jiao for fuel. It is not only time-saving and cost-saving, but also very exquisite and beautiful. The size of the stove is divided into four types, and the highest selling price is set at nineteen yuan. The Ministry of Industry has allowed a patent for five years to promote it. It is heard that Mr. Xi intends to set up a manufacturing factory in Shanghai to meet social needs and produce as much as possible.</p>

<p>Letter from the Fourth Branch of the Second Municipal Joint Association to the French Consul General</p>
<p>Requesting Correction of Erroneous Actions by Chinese Inspectors</p>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Joint Association of Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession sent a letter to Mr. Gabriel, the French Chief of Police, yesterday, saying: "We are writing to you regarding a letter from Wang Lianqing of Wang Shunxing Woodware Shop at No. 206, Pingjili Road, a member of our association, stating that on the evening of the 12th of this month, around 8 pm, a large number of detectives from the French Concession police station suddenly came to the shop to search, claiming to be catching gamblers. At that time, four relatives of the shop's upstairs tenants, who were engaged in the old goods business, were gathering to play mahjong. After the detectives came upstairs, they found no gambling and told the four people that they could continue playing mahjong and did not arrest them. Then they went downstairs, and then went upstairs again, arresting all four people. They also dragged Wang Wenqing, an apprentice of our shop, who was already in bed downstairs, out of bed. The Chinese Inspector Qian Chenglong raised a handgun, aimed it at him, and threatened him to confess the gambling den. The apprentice did not know what was being asked and replied that he did not know. The inspector then began to beat him with fists and feet, arbitrarily assaulting him. Later, he was taken to the police station, where he was imprisoned, tortured, and threatened to confess that Mr. Dong Wenli was running a gambling den, in an attempt to falsely accuse a businessman. Inspector Qian said, 'You can say that Dong Wenli runs a gambling den, and I will release you.' The apprentice was young and, under such intimidation, could only answer 'yes.' It was not until the next day that everyone was released. We believe that gathering to play mahjong is a form of recreation and entertainment, which has always been allowed in the concession. We merchants do not understand the basis for the sudden arrival of the police detectives. After searching and finding nothing, and after the detectives allowed the four people to play mahjong, they arrested them again and went downstairs to drag the apprentice out of bed and torture him to confess. What crime did the apprentice commit to suffer such humiliation? According to the inspector's instigation, he pointed to Mr. Dong's gambling, which was a fabricated accusation. We merchants are at a loss to understand whether there is any personal animosity involved. Now our shop's apprentice is unwell due to the shock. Under such circumstances, how can we merchants conduct business? Therefore, we are reporting the facts to your association. At the same time, according to a letter from Mr. Dong Wenli, a standing committee member of our association, the police station sent detectives to search and monitor him. He is requesting that we find a way to negotiate this matter. Based on this, our association has conducted a detailed investigation. According to our association's standing committee member, Mr. Dong Wenli, he is indeed a legitimate businessman and has no illegal activities. This time, Inspector Qian's accusation of him gambling is completely unfounded and amounts to slander of a merchant's reputation and deliberate insult. Moreover, playing mahjong is a form of recreation and entertainment for merchants and citizens and is not prohibited by law. The inspector's repeated mistakes of detaining and assaulting people constitute an abuse of power and an infringement on the people's freedom. Therefore, after an emergency meeting of the executive committee of our association, it was decided that we should request your Consul General to thoroughly investigate the truth, correct the erroneous actions of the inspector, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, in order to reassure the citizens and uphold the rule of law. We are sending this letter to you specifically, hoping that you will investigate and handle it, and give us a reply. February 15, 24th year of the Republic."</p>

<p>Civilian Sanatorium Expands Wards The Civilian Sanatorium at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road has been established for many years. The director, Yang Zhongfu, strives for perfection in the sanatorium's internal equipment. The chief physicians of various internal and external departments are all famous doctors. Therefore, the sanatorium's reputation has risen in recent years and has attracted the attention of the community. This is due to Director Yang's effective management. The sanatorium originally had dozens of wards. Because of the exquisite equipment and the fees being very suitable for the economic conditions of ordinary people, patients from the middle and upper classes have come from near and far, resulting in an insufficient number of wards. In view of this, the sanatorium has recently added several ordinary wards. The internal facilities are similar to those of the first and second-class wards, but the fees are several times lower. It has also hired more nurses, so that ordinary poor patients can enjoy the highest spiritual and material benefits at a small cost. Director Yang's dedication to helping the world can be seen from this. The sanatorium provides free diagnosis and medicine every day from 8:00 am to 10:00 am.</p>

<p>—Result: Another Drop of Seven Yuan—</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw overseas silver prices rise alarmingly, and the Central Bank's customs gold unit plummeted. Although public sentiment remained stable, sellers were more active and created a low price of 917 yuan. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both England and the United States rose sharply, exchange rates contracted slightly, and although London gold rose by 2.5 pence, public sentiment was difficult to maintain. Preliminary trading outside the market opened and retreated to 22-23 yuan, then rose to 24 yuan. Unexpectedly, the Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both England and the United States rising and the customs gold unit plummeting by 2.4%, pushing the standard gold price down to 953.6 yuan, rising and then falling again. After the opening, due to the lack of sellers from banks, swap transactions and long positions were squeezed, and forward exchange rates hardened again. Large traders came in and out again, sellers showed courage, lacked support, and retreated to within 20 yuan, creating a new low of 918 yuan. Banks then came to support, and prices rebounded.

The silver tax remained unchanged and had little impact. The situation revolved.

Finally, the swap spread rose again to 13 yuan, and supply was relatively abundant. At noon, the market seemed tired, and the afternoon market was flat and tired, rising and falling uncertainly. Indian silver initially rose by 9 Anna and broke the 20 yuan mark, but buyers did not take it seriously, took advantage of the low prices to become active, and there was still a rebound.

Although there was a struggle after entering the market, it was difficult to maintain due to the abundance of sellers. At this time, banks were eager to buy, and prices rebounded. After entering the market, the situation was still fierce, and although a price of 917 yuan was created again, Sassoon came to buy shillings, and buyers were agile, once rising to the 20 yuan mark. The market closed flat and tired. Throughout the day, due to the start of swap transactions, turnover seemed light, and the overall trend was confusing.

Dingkang, Yuanmaoyong, Yicheng, Fuyu, Qingfayong, Fuchang, Zhengchang, Yifengyong, Fuyu, Yiyu, and Hengchangyong were on the selling side. Dafa Yong, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Wanxing, Shunli, Renfayong, Jiarun, Shenkang, Tongtaichang, and Yuanheng were on the buying side. Fuchang and Yongli advanced first and then exited. Fuxing and Zhaofengchang exited first and then entered. The Dalian gang and Wanxing did a total of 2,700 or more swaps, with less than 900 cleared. The Guangdong gang Shengsheng and Dahengxing remained quiet. The total number of transactions for the day was 24,976 in the morning market and 39,053 in the afternoon market.</p>
<p>The swap market was extremely mediocre, but eventually became popular. In the morning, preliminary estimates for the short side were a spread of 13-14 yuan. The situation was chaotic. Futai Xiang went up and spread, with Hengxing and Hengyu spreading 13 yuan. Futai Heng, Fu An, Chunyuan, Yongyu, Qingyong, and others came to spread, retreating to 12.5 yuan. Yuanmaoyong, Yifengyong, Dalian gang, Yongli, Fuxingyong, Hongxing, and others spread out, rising again to 3 yuan. However, there were many limit orders spreading in at 13 yuan, and it was difficult for prices to rise further. Chunyuan, Ruixing, Yuanyi, and Dingkang spread in. Yuanmaoyong, Yongli, Qingfayong, and Hengyu spread out, contending at around 13 yuan. After pressing, Yuanyi, Ruixing, Hengyu, Yongfeng, Tongfeng Heng, and others successively spread in, gradually falling to around 12.1 yuan. Dachang Xiang, Yuanmaoyong, Zhaofengchang, Yuqingyong, Yuanchangyong, Wanxing, Yuanshengyong, and Jinfengyong spread out one after another.

In the afternoon, Dadecheng, Yicheng, Fuchang, Qianchang Xiang, and Chunyuan Yong spread in, while Hengyu and Yongli spread out, contending at between 10.8 and 10.9 yuan. Hengyu and Dacheng Wuchang Xiang continued to spread out. Qianchang Xiang and Yuanmaoyong spread in with limit orders, struggling again at the 13 yuan mark. Later, Wuchang Xiang, Yuanshengyong, Shunli, Wanxing, Fuxingyong, Fuchang, and others rushed to spread out, and the price raisers tried their best, once rising above 13.5 yuan. The situation was extremely chaotic. At 3 o'clock, the official opening was a short position spreading in at 13.3 yuan. Hanhang, Yuxin, Xiangfu Xingyong, and Xuanchang continued to spread out and rose slightly. Chunyuan Yong spread in vigorously and fell. Shunmao, Tongtaichang, Qianchang Xiang, Yifengyong, Yuanheng, Fuxing, and others successively spread in, falling within 13 yuan. Jingfu, Yiyu, Yuanmaoyong, Qianchang Xiang, Xiangfengyu, Qingyong, Dafeng, Wanchangyong also came to spread in, and the turnover was small. The closing price fell to 12.7 yuan. After the close, Fuyu, Fuxingyong, and Fuchang spread out, rising to 13.5 yuan. Zhengchang spread in and retreated to 12.8 yuan. Yuanxiang and Yuanmaoyong spread out again, rising back to 12.8 yuan.

<h3 id="e166">Foreign Exchange Initially Loosens, Then Levels <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London's major exchanges saw near and far-term rates both rise to 18.75. It was said that after the market closed, the U.S. bought above the quoted price of 0.0625. New York silver rose by half a cent. London gold rose by two and a half pence. The exchange rate between British pounds and U.S. dollars narrowed by 125, U.S. dollars against British pounds fell by 25, British pounds against French francs fell by seven points. U.S. dollars against French francs remained unchanged. The exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices: one shilling six pence for British pounds, and thirty-six and a half yuan for British pounds. Compared to the previous close, British pounds had slightly loosened, while U.S. dollars were level. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with British pounds up by 25 and U.S. dollars up by half a yuan. Customs gold units fell sharply by two fen and four li, with little impact. After the opening, banks lacked buying interest, and the process became rigid. Banks took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the market shifted from loosening to leveling. It was anticipated that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official rates would be announced, with British pounds up by 125 and U.S. dollars up by 25. Thereafter, although banks bought in, the situation remained uncertain because Jewish merchant Qiao Zhipu and others were still selling. The silver equalization tax announcement remained unchanged. Subsequently, Chinese merchants' sentiment gradually stabilized, and banks' buying and selling were mixed, but the process was still mediocre. The afternoon market opened flat. Indian silver rose by nine annas. Chinese merchants' sentiment was subdued and showed signs of loosening, but banks still bought in at low prices, which helped to maintain the market. Sassoon also slightly bought in shillings. The process was close to leveling, with far-term rates loosening. By the close, recent selling prices were one shilling five pence nine three seven five and six pence premium for British pounds, and thirty-six and a half yuan for U.S. dollars, with little difference compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants' sentiment tended to weaken due to the sluggish gold market, initially buying in and then selling, resulting in a mediocre market. Jewish merchant Qiao Zhipu and Jiaotong sold shillings, while Macalie, Wah Bi, and Sassoon bought. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<p>Interbank Call Rate Remains at One Dime</p>
<p>In recent days, the financial situation has remained stagnant as usual, and the flow of funds among financial institutions has been unusually tight, making the prospects for business quite bleak. Under these circumstances, it is bound to be difficult for the money lending business to develop. Yesterday, the interbank call rate remained at one dime, the same as the previous day. In the morning, over 2.1 million was transacted in call loans, with over 800,000 in new issues. Native banks received over 14 million from general collection and delivery, over 2.5 million from wire transfers for early payments, over 600,000 from banknote recalls, over 500,000 in cash receipts, 200,000 from customer sources, and 50,000 in disbursements. Bank receipts: foreign banks received over 1.6 million in bill collections, over 3.5 million in various kinds of export goods and collateral, over 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 500,000 in special remittances, and 300,000 in withdrawals.

Furthermore, the total clearing volume at the Shanghai Clearing House on the 15th was 8,493,320.069 silver dollars, including 4,582,989.28 silver dollars and 3,910,331.41 silver dollars in wire transfers.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Securities Bulls Slightly Emerge, Third Customs Bond Rise Falters Slightly <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Recent Decline of Seven Dimes</p>
<p>Other Sectors Have Improved</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the storm surrounding the 23rd Customs Bond seemed to have calmed down slightly. Although the opening was slightly higher, the second session fell, and the range of fluctuations decreased significantly. Due to the small number of new transactions on the market, the major bulls slightly emerged. However, it seemed that the manipulators had not yet let go. At this time, only those who echoed the manipulators' actions from outside their circle were able to profit and close their positions. If the market were to fall again, it would be difficult to avoid another rally, as the manipulators' long positions currently have no opportunity to be sold off. If they were to release their positions slightly, those who follow the trend would inevitably cause a surge, and the manipulators would be hit. Apart from preparing funds to take delivery and gradually releasing the goods month by month, there is no other way to profit. If the government were to release spot goods, the manipulators would inevitably fail, harming others without benefiting themselves, and it would be like tying themselves up. It could be said that they would be making unnecessary trouble. The trends of other bonds on the market were slightly upwards. Each group was buying more than selling. At the morning opening, there were quite a few retail buyers, and all items rose slightly, generally by five cents to one dime to three dimes and a half. The 23rd Customs Bond for the current month was only good for one dime, and the next month was good for half a yuan. Market demand had become scarce. In the second session, the 23rd Customs Bond for the next month, numbers 5 and 11, was sold vigorously, suddenly falling by about eight dimes. Number 53 saw slight buying, and the future is still subject to much fluctuation. As a result of the market price, in addition to the 23rd Customs Bond down slightly by seven dimes or about three dimes, and number six down slightly by one dime, the rest all rose from one or two dimes to five dimes and a half. The total transaction volume was 11.12 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e169">New York Public Utilities Stocks See Downstream <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from Ban Feng Foreign Firm, yesterday (the 14th) the New York stock market was calm and had few changes. Special stocks were very active. The selling of Studebaker Motors was extremely fierce, as the stock will be delisted from February 25th. The stock exchange issued a notice stating that according to the company's recent reorganization plan, the stock is worthless. If the aforementioned reorganization plan is not implemented, the exchange will still allow the stock to be traded on the exchange. The bond market showed an upward trend, with US government bonds especially strong. The small exchange market saw both gains and losses. The total daily trading volume was 410,000 shares.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Yarn and Cotton Crash <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is turning down, with the downward trend being particularly intense. Because the number of futures contracts for this month is sufficient, receivers are in short supply due to the urgent need for funds, making the bulls even more afraid. As for the large-scale sales of spot yarn, there is still little hope. All economic quarters are withered, commerce is depressed, and the suppression by foreign merchants makes it even more difficult for the market to become excited.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Finds New Low Price</p>
<p>Before the market opened, the prices for all months showed signs of weakness, as the surrounding economic situation was adverse. Some of the deliveries due within the current month have had no takers, and the financial situation is extremely tight. Japanese bears are safely not covering their positions, so the amount of futures contracts on the table is still sufficient. Only a certain inland yarn factory is continuing to buy shorts, but this is still not enough to stop the downward trend. Prices for all months have fallen by three, five, or eight dimes. The afternoon opening was still weak, and new selling was seen to be active. New lows were found for all months, but there were 1,000 bales of spot yarn traded. Prices for all months fell by six, seven, or one yuan and one dime. It was found that 2,300 bales of Mingde were sold, 1,650 bales of Gengfeng, 800 bales of Gu Da, 850 bales of Dafeng, 900 bales of Shengyuan, 1,800 bales of Changfeng, and 1,250 bales of Run Kang. 1,600 bales of Jinchang were bought, 1,750 bales of Junchang, 850 bales of Renfeng, 2,400 bales of Taichang, 3,950 bales of Changfeng, 1,900 bales of Changji, 800 bales of Ruid, and 700 bales of Shengyuan. The highest and lowest prices and the closing price for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Over 1,000 Spot Yarn Sold to Customers</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are higher than before. It was found that all the buyers bought a total of 1,020 bales today, and the market conditions are similar to the previous day. The amounts bought by each group are as follows:</p>
<p>The flower market suddenly weakened because the rumors of the previous day were all nonsense, and American cotton rose slightly, Indian cotton continued to fall, and the verdict on the gold case was postponed again. In addition, the yarn market was unstable, and people were increasingly frustrated. However, the long positions of a certain cotton company not only did not see a settlement, but instead still increased. Therefore, the decline in the cotton market was not the same as the price of yarn.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao's Sellers More</p>
<p>Before the cotton market opened, American cotton rose slightly by two points, Indian cotton fell by one and a half rupees, gold prices softened, exchange rates were loosening, and people were lazy. The market was full of Tongzhou groups settling their long positions, and the market fell. Prices for all months fell by one and a half to two and a half dimes. In the afternoon, it was heard that the off-market price of Indian cotton had risen by only 0.25 rupees. The amount of cotton stored in Shanghai is increasing daily, with about one million dan in sight. Therefore, there were more sellers, but a certain company was still buying and increasing its positions. The market recovered slightly by five cents at the close. As a result, prices for all months fell by five cents to two and a half dimes. It was found that 3,300 dan of Dafeng, 1,800 dan of Yuanyuchang, 1,700 dan of Yikang, 2,900 dan of Suilong, 1,300 dan of Changji, 3,000 dan of Dafu, 1,300 dan of Changji, 1,300 dan of Yuanda, 1,400 dan of Zhenda, 1,300 dan of Taixing, 1,300 dan of Gengfeng, 2,100 dan of Yichang, and 2,600 dan of Run Kang were sold. 2,100 dan of Shengyuan, 2,200 dan of Yongchang, 8,100 dan of Changhe, 1,700 dan of Dafu, 2,800 dan of Yuanda, 3,200 dan of Changji, 4,300 dan of Ruida, and 4,100 dan of Yuanda were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Shen Xin Buys 400 Pieces of Spot</p>
<p>There is no large-scale development of spot cotton sales because the downward trend in the yarn market is intensifying. However, the purchasing appetite of the Shen Xin factory is still good.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Overseas Cotton Market Quiet and Firm <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with stable market conditions. There was no change in prices for any months. Then, due to the absorption of long positions by fellow traders and the sale of far-month contracts by the Far East, the market turned firm and strong. Apart from old longs settling their positions when prices rose, there were not many sellers. Before the close, New Orleans and Japanese traders sold, causing a slight reaction. The demand for spot goods is not good, but the fundamentals are still strong. Inland cotton farmers are generally unwilling to sell because the current market price seems too low compared to the one dime two cent loan. The close was firm. Spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices rose by one to five points. The British cotton market was stable. Spot prices rose by one point, and futures prices rose by one or two points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to the settling of long positions and selling by futures traders, but recovered due to covering by wide households and buying by European exporters. Pingguo rose by half a rupee, Aomula fell by one rupee, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.5 rupees. The original telegraphic record is on the left (dated 14th).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay dispatch, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 15th was 246 rupees, an increase of 0.75 rupees compared to the previous day's close. Attached is the US cotton statistical report for January (unit: thousands):</p>

<p>Total Stocks: 83,204 Bales</p>
<p>An Increase of 4,479 Bales Compared to the End of the Year</p>
<p>According to a survey by a foreign firm, the inventory of cotton yarn in Shanghai in January totaled 83,204 bales, an increase of 4,479 bales compared to the end of December last year. Among them, Japanese yarn accounted for 20,357 bales, an increase of 2,067 bales compared to the previous month, and Chinese and British yarn accounted for 62,847 bales, an increase of 2,412 bales compared to the previous month. The reason for the decrease in yarn sales is that the Lunar New Year is approaching, the financial situation is becoming tighter, and the purchasing power of various regions is weak. The export of Japanese yarn to overseas markets is also sluggish. The quantity and varieties of yarn stored in the warehouses of the three factories of Chinese, British and Japanese are listed below (unit: bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the morning opening, the prices for all months initially appeared flat, then became active. Foreign wheat was quoted at Chicago at eight cents to more than one dime, and Canadian wheat at four cents. When the prices opened, the market expected to see flat or fatigued prices due to a weakening trend in foreign wheat. The initial price for this month was only 2.25 dimes. Soon after, there were customers purchasing in this month and the factories in this city are decreasing their output, causing an absence of ample stocks. Therefore, customer sales were active, which made the people confident. Although there were no special circumstances for far-term futures, they also felt tight due to the condition in this month. Then, the transactions in all months were mostly swirling and did not become robust. If there will be good actual sales later, the market should present a stable situation. As a result, this month increased by 1.5 cents, March by 1.25 cents, April by 1.5 cents, May by 1.75 cents, June by 1.5 cents, and July by 1.25 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Wheat Futures Market Just Hovering <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat market, the prices for all months were stable after the morning opening. Foreign wheat was quoted at Chicago at eight cents to more than one dime, and Canadian wheat at four cents. When the prices opened, all months were fluctuating. Although foreign wheat was slightly lower, because the arrival of spot wheat was not abundant, the sellers of futures contracts were quiet. The market sentiment for all months was slightly better by one or two cents. By the afternoon opening, this month opened to eight dimes and seven cents and the price fell by two cents due to the exit of bullish traders. The far months were firm initially and also weakened slightly after the brokers sold. Afterwards, transactions will hardly be active due to the evident easing and obscure tightening of monetary conditions. As a result, this month was unchanged, March went down by one cent, and April increased by one cent. The spot market remained stable. Shandong Guide wheat opened at 3.9 yuan, second at 8.8 cents, estimated at one thousand bags. For Chicago wheat, it appears all buyers wanted to gain and close their positions. Winter wheat was restored by timely rain. Among the four brokerage firms in Chicago Market, regarding the result of the gold case, two believed it would increase.</p>

<p>Local Sales Dull, Japonica Rice Continues to Fall</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each trading house were over twenty houses, (with a total of three to four thousand shi). Light rice relied on the decision by customers. The help of traders from Beijing, Qinhuangdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Jinan altogether handled more than two thousand bags. Therefore, the market color can be considered to be affirmed. The price did not receive neither too much prosperity nor too much damage. Only the movement of higher-quality japonica rice became dull due to tight monetary conditions and this also created a dead end in the market. As a result, it was still difficult for it to maintain a stable situation and kept falling by several cents to around one dime. There were still no traders for the recent Yangjian Rice. Due to supply and demand difference, Yuanyuan Rice was also stabilized.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were around 20 boats for various trading houses from He Xia. The purchase of all goods was very sluggish. The price for medium and second-rate higher-quality japonica rice was short of nearly one foot. The price forms of medium and second-rate early and late rice and customer Yuanyuan Rice slightly improved. The prices of the other goods were stable. Only the top-quality Yangjian Rice was out of stock. Although the sales route was tiny, its price increased by about one dime. The top-quality light rice was not flowing into the market, and its price maintained firmness.</p>
<p>Wheat Bran Shouts High by Five Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat bran market presented a firm stance because the domestic routes are going along continuously. After the end of the Chinese New Year, some of the factories decreased their workload, which also decreased the wheat bran output. Therefore, the people were also feeling that the market was stable. Yesterday, a scattered brand of wheat bran opened at 2.65 yuan, increased by five cents. Fuxin wheat bran was already shouting to seven cents.</p>

The prices for Mianbai sugar from local factories were 17.2 yuan for Yuzhen Yuhao Number 1, 17.1 yuan for Number 1, 16.55 yuan for Number 3, and 16.8 yuan for Number 4, all down by two dimes from before. Although the price of Chaoqing land has increased, the exchange rate has been longer, making it worthwhile. Therefore, a company sold all of the Chaoqing arriving from Guangdong Zesheng and other ships the day before yesterday, totaling more than 1,500 bags. The upper-middle ones were 9.95 yuan, slightly lower than before. Longqing was 9.6 yuan, with no increase or decrease. Another company only exchanged the remaining quantity and was unwilling to unload it easily, appearing to have tightening intentions. Furthermore, the price of Shantou land is gradually increasing, with no signs of loosening.</p>
<h3 id="e177">North-South Goods: Raw Peanuts and Honey Dates Show Varying Increases and Decreases <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Raw Peanuts: Both yesterday and today, they have been opened, totaling around 350 tons. The opening price for peanuts from Kaifeng was 8.3 yuan to 8.2 yuan, the upper Dangshan peanuts were 7.15 yuan, and the Lan dui peanuts were 7.5 yuan. All were handled by Guangbang traders, slightly lower than before. It was reported that the Qingdao price fell and then rose. The Xuzhou peanuts here were unwilling to be sold cheaply and have a very firm foot. The market should not be too low.</p>
<p>Honey Dates: The stock is low. Customer goods last year were all made as collateral and they were unwilling to unload them easily. Therefore, the recent market had a very strong price. The higher-grade honey dates from Lanxi need 36 yuan, an increase of 6-7 yuan compared to the past. The top grades are subject to an additional discount as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Pitud Flower Colors and Wool Demand Exceeds Supply <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Flower color clothing materials such as new-style Tibetan camel gray with various stripes are suitable for making Chinese style robes, and also suitable for tailoring Western-style clothing sets. These types of goods, priced at around five to six yuan, are most popular and sold very well. North and South markets, clothing material shop owners and tailors from Shanghai all have purchasing demand, and supply falls short of demand. Yesterday, the transaction prices for Yongkang clothing materials were 5.4 yuan, Tianyou 5.25 yuan, and Mishun 5.3 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Geological Society's 11th Annual Meeting Opens: New Discoveries of Valuable Minerals in Hunan, Sichuan, and Shandong <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zuoquan Discovers the Order of Mineral Deposition in Ore Deposits</p>
<p>Yang Jie Discovers Metamorphism of the Yangfang Granite in the Western Hills</p>
<p>All Remain Silent for Three Minutes to Commemorate the Deceased Budasen and Others</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) After several days of preparation, the 11th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Geological Society commenced today (the 14th) at 10:00 AM in the Geological Survey Institute Library. All directors were in attendance, except for Ding Wenjiang, who was delayed en route due to a freight train derailment in Weishanzhuang this morning. Over a hundred members from various regions were also present, including Sked from Qilu University, Long Xiangqi, Director of the Xujiahui Observatory, and Wang Gongmu, Director of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau. Details from various parties are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Opening</p>
<p>Chairman Xie Jiarong delivered the opening address, stating that the meeting was originally scheduled to be held in the newly completed Geology Museum at Peking University. However, due to unfinished internal construction, it was moved to the Ping Institute Library. The society has a history of thirteen years, but two annual meetings were not held, making this the eleventh. A major highlight of this year's meeting is the awarding of the Grabau Medal. This medal was established by Grabau in 1925, and only the deceased Budasen and others have received it. However, the two individuals to whom the medal should be awarded today are not present, and their names will be temporarily preserved. Xie continued, stating that member Long Xiangqi, Director of the Xujiahui Observatory, accompanied Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on an inspection of the Northwest and took extremely valuable films from the plane, as well as presentations on the stratigraphy of both sides of the Yellow River and the geology of Ningxia, either through slides or film screenings. He hoped everyone would pay attention.</p>
<p>Reports</p>
<p>(1) Secretary of the General Assembly Sun Yunzhu reported on the loss of members in the past year and a half. According to statistics, Budasen and three others passed away in the past year and a half. (2) Qian Shengjun reported on the financial situation. (3) Weng Wenhao reported on editing matters, which was announced and approved for record by all members. (4) Wang Gongmu, Director of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, stood up and gave a very detailed report on the progress of scientific terminology. However, the matter is of great importance, and the efforts of the masses cannot form a solid wall, so he hoped that the Geological Society would provide assistance and jointly review it, as this issue is related to the development of science education in China and is extremely important in academic terms. Weng Wenhao and Sked then successively expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>Memorial Service for Deceased Members</p>
<p>The chairman then proposed that all members observe one minute of silence for the deceased members to express their condolences. This was unanimously agreed upon, and everyone stood and remained silent for three minutes. The meeting place was immediately quiet and solemn. At this point, the business meeting of the 11th Annual Meeting of the Geological Society was declared closed, and films were then shown, including stratigraphy of the Yellow River basin, and conditions in Ningxia province. The showing ended around 12 o'clock, and a photo break was taken.</p>
<p>Chinese Iron Ore</p>
<p>Xie Jiarong read the paper "Classification of Chinese Iron Ore" at 2:00 PM. The gist of it was as follows: The classification method of Chinese iron ore presented this time refers to the latest ore deposit theory, with genesis as the main factor and the type, age, and deposition method of the ore-bearing layer as secondary factors, divided into five major categories and seventeen types. Each type is named after a place name, such as the Shanxi type and the Xuanlong type. According to Xie's classification method, expert Grabau expressed his approval on the spot.</p>
<p>New Mineral Discovery</p>
<p>Wang Zuoquan announced the paper "Research on Tin Arsenic Ore in Hunan" at 2:40 PM. The main points of his discovery are as follows: The Hunan ore deposit occurs in the Carboniferous limestone and is very close to granite. The collected specimens were polished into smooth surfaces and thin sections, placed under reflective and transmissive microscopes for separate examination. As a result, the main minerals found were arsenopyrite, cassiterite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, stannite, magnetite, pyrite, bornite, chalcocite, enargite, and other detailed examination of the order of deposition of each mineral ore, the relationship between primary and secondary, and the presumed formation of cylindrical ore deposits. It seems that the ore deposited earlier first constitutes the circular outer ring, which is then filled with the minerals deposited later.</p>
<p>Ore Deposits Discovered</p>
<p>Zhu Xiren read the paper "Genesis of Copper Deposits in Western Sichuan" at 3:30 PM. His new discoveries are as follows: (1) Copper ore in basalt is widely distributed in western Sichuan. Its genesis is all attributed to the influence of post-eruption effects. At that time, the temperature should be below 250 degrees Celsius. The source of its sulfide ore should be agglomerated from the basalt body itself. (2) Sedimentary copper ore is located in the coal-bearing rock at the bottom of the Triassic strata. The negative rock is directly located on the secondary Triassic basalt. The genesis of this type of copper ore is that during the Triassic period, this estuary or marine sediment's coast was formed by secondary Triassic basalt. Copper ore from basalt is weathered into copper sulfate liquid.</p>
<p>Granite Metamorphism</p>
<p>Yang Jie announced the paper "Metamorphism Around the Yangfang Granite in the Western Hills of Beiping" at 4:00 PM. His new discoveries are as follows: Between Yangfang, Dajuesi, and Wenquan in the Western Hills of Beiping, there is a large granite outcrop. This rock was obstructed by the orogenic movement in the early Cenozoic era. Because of its relatively new age, the ages of the various strata connected to it are also very complicated. In the north, west of Yangfang, this granite is in contact with volcanic rock layers. In a certain location of Jufeng Dajuesi, there is also a layer of shale between the granite and the volcanic rock. In Nan'anhe Wenquan and other places, the granite is in contact with metamorphic limestone. Above this limestone, there is a thick layer of shale, which is commonly seen in Jufeng Dajuesi and other places. The Chengzi Mountain and Shijingshan mountain ranges are entirely made of this rock. Above this thick shale is the coal system, followed by thick sandstone shale, followed by intrusive rock, and the uppermost is shale, sandstone, gravel, etc. These strata have undergone metamorphism due to the granite magma. From this metamorphism, various metamorphic minerals were regenerated. The geological structure here is also quite interesting. The northern granite directly fills the upper volcanic rock layer, the western part fills the lower shale layer above the volcanic rock, and the southern part only reaches the lower Paleozoic limestone. Therefore, this ah limestone should be Cambrian and Ordovician, and the shale above it should be the Jiulongshan series. The shale between Dajuesi and Jufeng should be contemporaneous. Also, south of Chengshan, due to faults, the Mei system (should be the Yangjiatun system) overlies Jiulong. Because at the uppermost part of this coal, there is the Jiulongshan series. In addition, in Wenquan East, Heilongtan and other places, the coal system is in direct contact with wood ash rock, which can prove that from the south of Chengzi Mountain to Heilongtan there is a fault. There should be more springs in this fault, but on the line of Jinshan Dajuesi, the springs should have another origin and should not be confused. This is because the upper part is a volcanic rock layer, which receives seepage and flows downwards, flows to the upper surface of the lower granite, and then flows out.</p>
<p>Orthoclase Quartz</p>
<p>Chen Guoyuan read the paper "Orthoclase Quartzite of Ma'anshan, East of Rongcheng County, Shandong" at 5:45 PM. The gist is as follows: The geology of Rongcheng County can be said to have not been well studied until now. Now only a simple study of the geology of Ma'anshan in the southeast is presented. This mountain has two peaks, named for its saddle-like shape. The lower layer in its western part is a most interesting orthoclase rock. This rock is mostly composed of orthoclase, and between these minerals, there are many quartz, hornblende microcrystals. Above this orthoclase rock is the upper trachyte, and above that is rhyolite. Therefore, it can be inferred that the age of this rock is the most recent, or it may be similar to the alkaline orthoclase rocks in Linxian, Shanxi. Chen finished reading the paper at 6:40 PM. The chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting and that the meeting would continue tomorrow (the 15th) with public lectures in the morning and papers read in the afternoon. (14th)</p>

<p>The educational measures for the descendants of Confucius were jointly reviewed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education and submitted to the Central Government for approval. Each person admitted to a university will be given 800 yuan, and each person admitted to a secondary school will be given 400 yuan, but only the direct descendants of the four surnames Kong, Yan, Zeng, and Meng (Confucius, Yan Hui, Zeng Shen, and Mencius) are eligible. In addition, for primary school education, a survey will first be conducted to determine whether primary school education has been established in Qufu, Shandong. If there are primary schools for the descendants of the four surnames Kong, Yan, Zeng, and Meng, subsidies will be provided to expand enrollment. If no primary school has been established, another plan will be made to establish one to achieve more. The Ministry of Education has ordered the Shandong Education Department to conduct a close and thorough investigation of the current number of descendants of Confucius in Qufu, as well as the detailed situation of how many people can enter universities or secondary schools, in order to plan. It is also heard that during the investigation, the Lu Education Department will be asked to find out how many descendants of the four surnames Kong, Yan, Zeng, and Meng there are in total, their level of education, where the four surnames live, and whether there are any public or private primary schools or public buildings that can be used for schools. All details will be reported.</p>

<p>Huhong Primary School Enrolls Students Without Reporting</p>
<p>Decision to Ban and Send Letter to Special Zone Court for Sealing</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) Recently, the opening of private schools in this city has been like mushrooms after rain, and some of them are using schools to collect money, and even run away with the money, which is a great disgrace to the education sector. The so-called "lane primary schools" in the Hongkou area are even worse. For example, the previous founding of the Dajiang, Dongya, and Jinling schools all have factual evidence. In view of this, the Municipal Education Bureau has repeatedly notified the directors of various private schools that they should bear economic responsibility. Recently, the Huhong Primary School at No. 35 Tianhou Lane, Yuezhou Road, Hongkou, enrolled students without reporting according to law. After investigation by the Municipal Education Bureau, in order to rectify education, it has been banned and a letter has been sent to the Public Concession Engineering Bureau and the Shanghai First Special Zone Local Court for sealing.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Shanghai University Federation Advocates Proper Entertainment for Students <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Art Research Set as Extracurricular Work</p>
<p>Assist Students in Organizing Art Research Associations</p>
<p>Since banning students from dancing, the Shanghai University Federation has taken a step further to advocate proper entertainment for students. At the first general meeting of this year, the proposal to promote proper entertainment, proposed by the presidents of Jiaotong University and the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, was passed and sent to all universities for implementation. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Advocacy</p>
<p>In recent times, general schools lack guidance in spiritual life, and students have no proper entertainment outside of class to regulate their minds. Although the previous resolution of this meeting to ban dancing was to correct the students' habits, it was not what was intended without guidance in the active aspect. My colleagues and others have based on the resolutions of the Executive Committee, proposed that schools organize art research associations to be a proper extracurricular activity for students, which can not only cultivate temperament, improve students' interests, cultivate a solemn school group, but also promote the glory of China's inherent culture, search for the elite of foreign art studies, integrate them, and lay the foundation for a new culture.</p>
<p>Implementation Methods</p>
<p>(1) Schools should jointly organize extracurricular calligraphy, painting, epigraphy, poetry, children's music, drama, photography, and other research associations by teachers and students in each college or grade. (2) The above research associations should be designated as extracurricular work by schools in the school rules, and the school authorities should vigorously promote and assist. (3) The research associations should set up research and administrative departments. The research department should be divided into research, lecture, editing, visit, and exhibition groups, and the administrative department should be divided into document, accounting, general affairs, and communication groups, which should be taken care of by members. (4) The research associations should be held regularly and experts from inside and outside the school should be invited to guide or lecture. (5) Research associations, competitions, review meetings, exhibitions, concerts, and federations of various schools should be used to connect feelings and learn from each other. (6) The organizational charter of the research association will be formulated separately.</p>
<p>Circular to Various Schools</p>
<p>The association sent a letter to various universities in the city, saying, "Respectfully, the first general meeting of the 23rd year resolved to promote the use of domestic products and sent a circular to various schools to promote them as much as possible. Domestic products should be selected for stationery and provincial examinations. The proposal to promote savings among faculty and staff was resolved to be sent to various schools to seek opinions. As for the proposal to promote proper entertainment, it was resolved to ask schools to organize art research associations and send the proposals of Jiaotong University, Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, and Tongji University to various schools for reference."</p>
<p>Organizations Springing Up</p>
<p>Since the advocacy, various schools have organized one after another. The methods of Jiaotong University and Tongji University are recorded below. (A) Jiaotong University supplements the method of promoting proper entertainment for students. (1) Ask various music schools to hold concerts regularly. (2) Ask various art schools to hold art exhibitions regularly. (3) Organize holiday trips and weekend trips. (4) Hold valuable and interesting movies. (5) Exchange various entertainment performances between universities. (6) Organize research associations for calligraphy, painting, and photography. (7) Organize rowing boat competitions. (B) Tongji University's proposed proper entertainment methods are as follows. Organize art research associations, which are initiated by students from each school, and teachers and staff with artistic skills and interests are invited to participate. The association charter is formulated and meetings are held regularly, or exhibitions are opened for people to read in order to learn from each other. As for the types of art research, they can be divided into the above several types. (1) Painting. (2) Calligraphy. (3) Photography. (4) Sculpture.</p>

<h3 id="e191">What College Graduates Should Know About Serving in the Banking Industry <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Shoumin</p>
<p>The following is an address by Mr. Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, to the special probationary employees:</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it has been three or four months since you joined the bank. I have been too busy with affairs to meet with you. Today, I am taking the opportunity to talk to you, firstly to get to know everyone, and secondly to express my hopes for you. Now, let me start by talking about the history of our bank.</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications was established in the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty with the approval of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, as a joint government-private venture. It was stipulated that in addition to ordinary banking business, all funds related to the four major administrations—postal, shipping, telegraph, and railway—would be managed by our bank. Hence the name "Communications." At that time, the nature of our bank's business was truly a specialized bank with a dedicated mission. This can be considered the "first period" in the history of our bank. In the third year of the Republic of China, the President promulgated the Regulations of the Bank of Communications, stipulating that in addition to ordinary business, the bank was permitted to manage special accounting funds of the national treasury and had the right to manage national treasury bonds and issue convertible notes. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, a general sub-branch for regional issuance was established, specializing in the preparation of publicly independent issuances. Later, after various changes and numerous replacements, the period was very long. This can be considered the "second period" in the history of our bank. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the principles were changed, and the National Government announced conditions to make our bank a national industrial development bank, setting the business term to thirty years. Thus, our bank re-specified the undertaking of various businesses, and the head office was also moved to Shanghai at that time. At that time (the eighteenth year of the Republic of China), I took office as the manager of the Shanghai branch, determined to operate diligently to promote development. This can be considered the "third period" in the history of our bank.</p>
<p>Now, I am back to serve the Bank of Communications, overseeing the overall bank affairs. I originally hoped to "make waves within the established framework." Unfortunately, the world economic situation is unfavorable, the rural economy is bankrupt, and natural and man-made disasters have followed one after another. The situation is different, the environment is complex, and the original plan may not be achieved immediately. We can only be determined, work hard, and eventually achieve our goals. We will discuss this matter next time.</p>
<p>In the past, the bank's personnel system emphasized emotions. Because the recommendation system was used, relatives and friends could be introduced. I dare not say that all the colleagues who came in through the recommendation system were bad, but at least I can say that this kind of recommendation system is absolutely unsuitable for today's evolving society. Furthermore, if I have relatives who are officials, then I can also become an official. This kind of bad situation is one of the major reasons for the lack of progress in various Chinese enterprises. The prosperity of all undertakings depends entirely on talent. Without talent, there is no enterprise. Even if an enterprise can be barely maintained, it is not easy to develop. I often lament that there are many idle people in society, and the authorities lament the difficulty of finding talent. This phenomenon is indeed a current situation in Chinese society. Some people often say that this is all due to the bad recommendation system, but I deeply sympathize with this situation. Therefore, to change this system, there is nothing better than examinations and selections, and the method of recommending outstanding graduates from universities. I feel especially gratified to be talking to you today.</p>
<p>I do not talk about personal feelings, nor do I advocate recommendations. I use screening methods and examination systems to select outstanding talents. This is not only a first for our bank but also rare among our counterparts. Therefore, I have great expectations for you and feel a very urgent need. In recent years, the banking industry has gradually become more specialized and technical. Those engaged in banking must not only have the skills of calculating accounts and the experience of bookkeeping but also have legal knowledge, scientific methods, and applied technology to improve efficiency. For investments in the industrial sector, specialized talent is even more needed for investigation and research. Therefore, your arrival here is partly a supplement to the bank's need for talent and partly a response to the need for specialized knowledge. Although you are currently ordinary bank staff, you will all be the backbone of the bank in the future. Therefore, you must understand the importance of your position and realize the vastness of your future.</p>
<p>When you leave school life and enter society, you should always remember that the first thing is to read, the second is to gain experience, and the third is to determine your work direction and become a well-rounded talent. This kind of well-rounded talent is not only for our bank; in a few years, we hope to produce many managerial talents for the banking industry and create many general manager talents. This is my fundamental principle of cultivating and cherishing talent.</p>
<p>In terms of work, some people used to advocate that good performers should stay and bad performers should be returned to their schools. This kind of policy should be the case in terms of employing people. But now, after reading your internship reports from various departments, most of them are not bad, and some are excellent. I can say that all of you can stay, and the official announcement has already been made. We will assess your work performance again and promote those with excellent performance at any time. Those who are not performing well will still have screening days. You should pay special attention.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am here working with you all, and everyone should serve the bank with all their energy. Everyone should understand each other's situation. Now, let me introduce my experience to you. I am neither a college graduate nor a middle school graduate. I came from a money shop and reached this position entirely through experience. I have worked in accounting, business, cashiering, and documentation. I have also been the manager of small and large banks. My environment has involved perseverance, hard work, striving, patience, etc. From the late Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, there is nearly 30 years of history. Even if the late Qing Dynasty is not counted, there are already 23 years of relations with the financial world. Therefore, to have considerable success, there must be considerable effort and time. You have just left school and do not need to be overly eager for quick success. You have now been assigned to various positions, including eleven in the audit department, four in the business department, six in the business research office, and one in the savings and credit department. This is the beginning of serving the bank. But how your future will be depends on your efforts. Now, let me tell you what I hope for you. Please pay attention.</p>
<p>(1) Patience: The most important thing when serving society is to endure hardship and work hard. When encountering unsatisfactory things, you should be patient. Even if you are wronged temporarily, someone will eventually see it. When you are dissatisfied with the bank's affairs, do not be polite. Use legal procedures to state your opinions. Now, we must break bad habits and not have class concepts. If there is not enough time for a face-to-face conversation, or if there is no time for a face-to-face conversation, you can use communication methods to explain. I am very willing to accept your opinions and will never subject you to any grievances.</p>

<p>Breaks World Record</p>
<p>Tokyo, Japan, 15th dispatch from the Japanese Press Association: American swimmer John Higgins created a new record of 1 minute and 11.8 seconds for the 100-meter breaststroke at a competition on January 13, breaking the previous world record of 1 minute and 12.4 seconds held by a French athlete. The swimming style used by Higgins is the so-called butterfly stroke (Bettergby), which is newly popular in the United States. This record confirms the advantages of this swimming style. It is expected to revolutionize the world of swimming. If this swimming style demonstrates its power in the future, Japan must also study it. The butterfly stroke involves extending both hands forward in the water during the breaststroke. However, this method lifts both hands out of the water to the side and then moves them forward, making it very fast. Its appearance is like a butterfly flapping its wings, hence the name.</p>

<p>Xinguang Wins Against Zhongshe (Group B2): 38 to 21</p>
<p>Zhenru Wins Against Dongya (Group AA): 41 to 23</p>
<p>Haizei Wins Against Jiangwan (Group AA): 55 to 39</p>
<p>Maijin Wins Against Yingdui (Group AA): 60 to 43</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association had three Group AA games last night, one after another. Zhenru, Haizei, and Maijin won, while Dongya, Jiangwan, and Yingdui were defeated. However, the performances of Jiangwan and Yingdui can be considered excellent in the first half of the games. Unfortunately, they could not persevere to the end. The situations of the three matches are described on the left.</p>
<p>Zhenru Wins Against Dongya</p>
<p>In the battle between the two armies, Dongya took the lead with 4 to 0. The Zhenru players calmly faced the battle and gradually caught up and surpassed them. Afterwards, Dongya was too eager to win, which led to the situation of wanting to achieve quick success but not achieving it. As a result, Zhenru won with a score of 41 to 23.</p>
<p>Haizei Defeats Jiangwan</p>
<p>Jiangwan's soldiers cautiously approached the enemy, making the tenacious Haizei unable to act fiercely for a time. They also took the lead with scores of 8 to 4 and 10 to 6, occupying the peak for ten minutes. The Haizei was in a precarious situation. Smith replaced Klaus, and Jiangwan suffered from it. Despite their efforts to resist, they were able to equalize twice at 14 to 16. This was the golden age of Jiangwan's overall game. In the second half, the Haizei became even more rampant. The defensive power of this side gradually weakened, resulting in an irrecoverable battle. After fighting for forty minutes, they were defeated by the Haizei with a score of 55 to 39.</p>
<p>Maijin Defeats Yingdui</p>
<p>The entire Yingdui army embraced the determination to fight to the death, determined to fight the brave Maijin. After the start, they played vividly, once occupying an absolute advantage with a score of 12 to 2. However, the opponents were tall and strong, and they were able to catch up. By the end of the first half, they reversed the score with 26 to 24 and took the lead by one point. In the second half, Yingdui was still able to hold on for ten minutes, but afterwards, they felt that their hearts were strong but their strength was insufficient, and they had to admit defeat. The final result was 60 to 41.</p>
<p>Tonight's Schedule</p>
<p>Muer vs. Yaoguang B1, 5:40 PM, Liu Hesheng</p>

<p>18 to 23</p>
<p>The results of the three games of the Xiqing Women's Basketball Association last night were: (1) Group B: Xiqing A wins against Xiqing B, 17 to 11.

<p>The American Community and Black Hawk teams were evenly matched, so the competition was extremely fierce. In the first three quarters, the American Community always led by three points. Until the fourth quarter, Black Hawk made great efforts and once took the lead with a score of 18 to 16. Unfortunately, in the end, the American Community had more offensive opportunities, and Bai Naite's shooting was surprisingly accurate, so Black Hawk was still defeated, which was a great pity.</p>

<p>Before the age of twenty, people are inexperienced; after the age of fifty, energy gradually declines. The thirty years in between, however, are carelessly wasted! When exactly do people live and work?</p>
<p>The woodpecker is indeed a strange bird, specializing in eating woodworms. I really don't know if it exists for the sake of woodworms, or seeks woodworms for the sake of existence?</p>
<p>In the morning, I heard the rattling sound of an airplane. I thought that people were soaring into the sky, while I was still lying in bed, so I couldn't help but get up.</p>
<p>On West Lake, pavilions, tombs, terraces, and pagodas are everywhere. The landscape does not need such things to embellish it, but such things must embellish the landscape!</p>
<h3 id="e204">Elementary School Students <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>As soon as the bell rings, dozens of elementary school students pour out of each classroom. - This is the scene of dismissal at an elementary school.</p>
<p>Thus, a large open space is filled with the future masters of China. Although some are playing with large and small balls, most of them are running around, chasing and fighting with all their might, verbally abusing the ancestors of the chased for seventeen or eighteen generations.</p>
<p>Clusters of them are playing "Three Iron Roosters" learned from their fathers taking them to the theater, or "Cloud Comes, Fog Goes, Win or Lose" tricks obtained from novels rented from door-panel book stalls. Other clusters are playing marbles on the ground, rolling coins, desperately trying to lead the money in other people's pockets into their own.</p>
<p>These games are not for girls. The extracurricular work of girls in small cheongsams or long coats and short skirts is always to protect their younger brothers and sisters, or to talk with their female classmates about how to cut their hair, what color to make their scarves, or what Mr. So-and-so's long gown is like, and how Mr. So-and-so speaks. But in elementary schools, girls are as easily bullied by boys as women are in ordinary society. It is a common and uneventful thing for a girl to be standing nicely and to be pinched, groped, or hit by a boy.</p>
<p>At the school gate, there are crowded vendors. "Five-spice peanuts," "Hong Kong beef," "Preserved tangerine peel," "Lard and fruit sesame candy," etc., are all available. There is also "One copper to win a prize," "Thirty-six doors, every door has a prize." There are also "Three copper coins for a pencil, twenty cents for a fountain pen." There are also, and there are endless forms and styles, and every stall is crowded with elementary school students.</p>
<p>The bell rings again, and the elementary school students flock into the classrooms, flocking into the classrooms to receive education to become the future masters of China.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Charming Suzhou <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Suzhou is so charming. It is like a beauty, intoxicated in a pink dream, sometimes giggling, sometimes slightly frowning, enough to make people feel short of breath when they see it.</p>
<p>Radio broadcasts are noisy all day long. If you walk through Guanqian Street, you can hear all kinds of tunes you have never heard before. No, even if you walk through the streets and alleys, you can see tall antennas crisscrossing. This proves that wireless radios have become a blessing for every household in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Since the advent of wireless radio, Suzhou has added many performing artists, who were very popular for a while. Today, Qian Mansion in Taohuawu orders "Crying Seven Seven": tomorrow, Li in Lianxifang orders "Afraid of Wife," Huang in Daru Lane orders "Little Orphan Widow": the day after tomorrow, a store on Lindun Road orders "Comic Daochang," Zhao in Gushixiang orders "Catching Zhang Sanlang Alive." They—the performing artists—are really too busy. According to their reports, they are very honored to receive many letters from all walks of life requesting songs. But in one day, some order "Crying Seven Seven," some order "Afraid of Wife," and some order... It is really like the public wants wontons and the mother-in-law wants noodles, which makes them really embarrassed. Because time is limited and they only have one mouth, the words "Junior," "Apologies," etc., have become their opening remarks before broadcasting.</p>
<p>Just in terms of hearing, Suzhou is charming enough. In terms of sight, there is no need to talk about daytime. Once it gets dark, if you stroll through Guanqian Street, you will be dazzled. The towering bank buildings and the red and green New Year lanterns, although not as grand as Shanghai's Avenue Joffre, are enough to be charming.</p>
<p>Suzhou is charming, and Suzhou is intoxicated in a pink dream.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Skating <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Beiping Guest</p>
<p>Although the New World had a skating game department eight or nine years ago, those skating games were just skating on the floor with wheeled skates, which is very different from our Beiping skating;</p>
<p>Beiping's ice rinks can be divided into two types; one is natural, which is those lakes or small rivers that freeze thick in early December of the lunar calendar, becoming natural ice rinks. The other is artificial, which is because the weather in the north is too cold, so a lot of water is poured in the courtyard overnight, and it will become an artificial ice rink tomorrow. The most famous natural ice rinks in Beiping are those of Yanjing University, and the three places of Nanhai and Beihai. The artificial ones are the ice rinks of Xiehe Hospital and Tsinghua University.</p>
<p>Skating shoes are not like the four-wheeled skates we see in Shanghai; they are a pair of long boots made of camel down, with a thin blade about two inches wide nailed to the bottom of the shoe. Therefore, for beginners, not to mention skating with this kind of skates, it is not easy to stand on the ice with a balanced body!</p>
<p>There are many skating games, in addition to ice racing, ice hockey, and writing patterns with skates, the best looking are the ice solo dance and duet dance. The graceful dance on the ice is much more beautiful than the dance partners on the smooth floor of any dance hall!</p>

<h3 id="e207">The Standard of Beauty <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>A professor of hygiene at the Technology Institute in Mesa, USA, recently published a method for judging beauty, which is to calculate the points of each part of the body. Only those who can get 100 points can be considered completely beautiful. His scoring method is very precise. That is: (1) Set the weight according to age and height as 20 points. (2) Hair has a shiny color when it is not oiled, set as 5 points. (3) Eyes are clean and clear, but those with yellow whites are still inferior, only clear and shiny eyes are 5 points. (4) The shape of the mouth shows happiness everywhere, set as 5 points, but those that droop when breathing are still inferior. (5) Teeth are very tight when chewing, set as 5 points. (6) The skin is bright and smooth, the texture is fine, and the cheeks and lips have natural color, set as 10 points. (7) The nails are clean, smooth, beautiful, and the entry and exit length are very perfect, set as 5 points. (8) The foot shape has natural beauty, and the line from the heel to the big toe is straight and not crooked, set as 10 points. (9) In terms of posture, the shoulders are balanced from left to right, the wrists are relaxed, the abdominal line is beautiful, and the two feet are parallel and slightly apart, set as 5 points. The shape of sitting is beautiful, set as 2 points. The ability to coordinate movement when walking, set as 2 points. Able to hear ordinary conversations from sixteen feet away, and have healthy hearing, set as 5 points. Two arms straight and have reading vision, set as 5 points. (10) In terms of health, the mind and body are refreshed, have self-control and enthusiasm, etc., set as 10 points. (11) The clothing can suit the personality and the time and place of the center, set as 5 points. According to this scoring method, among the female students of large, medium, and small schools, almost none meet the above 11 points, and those who get 96 points are only one person. This is based on the evaluations of various parties in Mesa, and it can be seen that it is really rare to be able to fully meet the above conditions.</p>
<p>Hairiweisima Ya and other beauty experts from Shenglin recently evaluated the standard of women's beauty from the three points of harmony, balance, and beauty. Among them, Ms. Xi Luoweiya Xituoni was praised by all the professional beauticians and considered the only and unique beauty. Ms. Xituoni is a native of Southern California. She was selected as the "Standard of Beauty" by the Southern California Beautician Association. The appearance of this lady, according to the structure of geometry, has almost no faults. That is: (1) The length of the face is three times that of the nose. (2) The space between the eyes and the middle of the eyes has the position of one eye. (3) The width of the upper lip is not bad at all. (4) The shoulder hair extension line harmonized from left to right converges at a point on the nose. (5) The gap between the lower face and the upper face is equal to the gap between the upper face and the eyebrows. (6) The eye is closest to the nose, separated from the middle of the upper part of the eye, without any difference. (7) The width of the cheek is exactly twice as large as the nose. After this standard beauty was published, women in Southern California went to beauty salons to be identified, but none were as neat as Ms. Xituoni.</p>

<p>Ninth Episode: Poor Flattery Leads to Scolding; Unable to Return, He Follows the Guest's Exaggerations</p>
<p>He sighed and said, "You, Madam, are thinking too much. With feet as small as yours, you can barely walk, how can you come out to work?" Madam Hu was about to sit down on the chair, but upon hearing this, she immediately supported herself on the table and stood up, saying, "Old Master Zhang, you haven't been to Gansu, you don't know. Women there, at home, wash clothes and cook, and outside, they can plant and harvest grain in the fields." Jie Fu looked at her, seeing her steadying herself on the table, still swaying slightly, and shook his head with a smile, saying, "No matter what, I cannot believe what you say. Even now, you can barely stand here, how can you work?" Madam Hu said, "What you say is true. However, in Gansu, we don't stand to work, we kneel to work." Hearing this, Jie Fu couldn't help but be surprised and looked at her, saying, "What? Kneel to work?" Jie Fu, hearing this, couldn't help but be surprised and looked at her, saying, "What? Kneel to work? At home, you can kneel to work, but when you go out the gate, to the fields, do you still kneel to work?" Madam Hu said, "Why not? As soon as we get there, we kneel down. We are not like the women of Xi'an, who can stand." As she spoke, her body swayed twice more. Jie Fu quickly waved his hand at her and said, "Terrible, terrible, just sit down, we'll talk slowly." Madam Hu, in fact, couldn't afford to be polite and sat down. Jie Fu moved the rattan-wrapped teapot on the table in front of her and said, "I won't stand on ceremony with you, there are teacups on the table, pour yourselves a drink. It's chilling." Madam Hu touched the lid of the rattan wrapping and then withdrew her hand. Yueying, standing on the side, said, "Drink it, it's nothing to drink two cups of tea from this old master." Hearing this, Madam Hu boldly drank two cups of tea. It was much warmer inside the house than outside. It was already late spring, and without the wind blowing, it wasn't too cold, so after two cups of warm tea, her spirits improved a lot. While she was drinking tea, Jie Fu couldn't help but look at Yueying. (134)</p>
<h3 id="e209">Record of Royal Fragrance, Misty and Floating <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Didn't I already say above that whenever the Empress Dowager had any unpleasant feelings, everyone in the palace would become worried? Therefore, we always tried our best to make her happy, especially in these gloomy ancient Shengjing palaces. If we didn't find some suitable spiritual adjustments, we would truly become lifeless! Therefore, when I thought that today was the fifteenth of the month, and according to custom, opera should be performed, I felt extremely happy in my heart.</p>
<p>"Old Buddha!" Although I didn't see her face as very gentle this morning, in order to remove this heavy cloud of sorrow, I boldly said to her, "Today is the fifteenth of the month again! Shouldn't we have an opera performance? In my humble opinion, letting the ancestors here also see our lively entertainment, so that they know that the world is still as prosperous and peaceful as before, wouldn't that be a very good way to show filial piety? Furthermore, since we no longer have any good places to go out and play here, just sitting around is too boring! Watching opera is the best pastime."</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager, upon hearing my words, actually revealed a trace of a smile and nodded her head slightly.</p>
<p>"That's right! Your idea is indeed good! Just do as you say!" She approved my suggestion without any hesitation.</p>
<p>"In that case, please instruct, Old Buddha, which operas should be performed today?" My risky attempt having succeeded, I became bolder and quickly urged her to select the plays.</p>
<p>"I have no preconceived notions, just pick one or two operas that you like to listen to!" Her smile gradually revealed itself. (245)</p>

<h3 id="e210">Radio Reception Record Form <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>—Meaning of Approved Audio Signal Symbols—</p>
<p>After a radio receives an incoming broadcast, its readings must be recorded to avoid the trouble of re-searching in the future, as everyone knows.</p>
<p>Simply recording the readings has no other value besides providing entertainment convenience. If one wants to meet practical needs and scientific reference, the scope of the records must be researched and expanded.</p>
<p>Radio reception is often better in cold weather than in hot weather, and better at night than during the day, so the first step is to record the date and time.</p>
<p>Secondly, the weather conditions, such as overcast skies, the presence of the moon, as well as temperature and air pressure, also affect the transmission and reception of radio waves, so recording the weather is also very important.</p>
<p>If the radio's location is frequently changed, the length, height, and direction of the antenna, as well as the location, must also be noted.</p>
<p>When receiving distant broadcasts, the signal strength fluctuates. This phenomenon is called fading in radio science. The reasons for this have been described in my article "Fading in Radios" in issue 77 of this publication. It varies at any time, any moment, and any place, so the state of fading must also be recorded.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of atmospheric electricity or other interference must also be noted.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing to record is the quality of the audio. The recording of this item has always been done according to individual preferences, with no regulations. Such a lack of regulation is, of course, not in line with scientific principles. In order to remedy this deficiency, the radio industry has defined the following two standard audio signal symbols:</p>
<p>(1) Volume Symbol: Usually represented by R, with nine levels of strength:</p>
<p>R1 Extremely weak R6 Fairly strong</p>
<p>R2 Very weak R7 Strong</p>
<p>R3 Weak R8 Very strong</p>
<p>R4 Fairly weak R9 Extremely strong</p>
<p>R5 Acceptable</p>
<p>(2) Quality Symbol: Broadcasts from distant locations are often difficult to understand clearly. Sometimes, even if they are very loud, they are still difficult to distinguish due to various interferences. Therefore, a quality symbol is also specified, usually represented by Q.</p>

<h3 id="e211">From Radio Calibration Curves to Experimental Measurement Methods for Coil Inductance <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shengshi</p>
<p>Anyone who has a radio should draw their own calibration curve. This curve is very useful; it not only tells you the location of each station but also helps you find distant stations.</p>
<p>What is a calibration curve? I think most readers already know, but since it will be used below, it may be worthwhile to explain it simply again. Every radio has a tuning circuit consisting of a coil and a variable capacitor. The dial of this capacitor is usually divided into one hundred divisions. The dial of this capacitor is usually divided into one hundred divisions. Turning this capacitor allows you to receive stations of different frequencies.</p>
<p>Now, take a piece of graph paper, with one hundred small divisions horizontally representing the dial readings and the vertical axis representing the station's kilocycle frequency, ranging from 500 to 1500 (as shown in Figure 2). Then, pay attention to the stations you hear. For example, if you hear the Central Broadcasting Station at 90 degrees, mark a point at 90 on the horizontal axis and write down the words "Central." The Central Broadcasting Station is at 660 kilocycles, so go up from this point and mark a point at 660. Use the same method to record the other stations one by one. Stations in Shanghai often report their call signs, so this step can be completed soon. Then, connect the many points with a curve plate to get a curve or a straight line, depending on the type of capacitor. I use the Ame 3121, so the curve drawn is as shown in the figure. Its greatest use is twofold:</p>
<p>(1) The location of a station with a known frequency can be determined from the curve. For example, the Fuzhou Broadcasting Station is located between the Eastern and Central-Western stations and is usually inaudible (when using a regenerative DC three-tube radio in Kunshan), but because it is 1030 kilocycles, it is known from the curve that it must be at 29 degrees. On the night of the 28th, when both the Eastern and Central-Western stations were off the air, turning the dial to 29 degrees clearly heard the report in the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>(2) The frequency of any station heard can be determined from the curve. My radio has heard eight Japanese stations, none of whose call signs I have heard, but a check of the curve can reveal their station names. For example, there is a Japanese station at 87 degrees next to the Central Broadcasting Station. From the curve, it is known that it must be 670 kilocycles, which is the Taipei Broadcasting Station.</p>
<p>This curve also has another use, which is that it can be used to find the inductance L of the coil. We know that the station's reading is closely related to the inductance L and the capacitance C, expressed by the formula:</p>
<p>where F is the station's frequency, L is the inductance (Henry), and C is the capacitance (Farad).</p>
<p>The maximum capacitance of ordinary capacitors C is known. For example, the Ame 3121 is 0.0003 microfarads. This value is the capacitance when the dial is turned to 100 degrees. What frequency does this point correspond to? If there is a station exactly at 100 degrees, that's the best. If not, the curve can be extended smoothly to 100 degrees to see what the frequency is at that point. Because the curve is already close to a straight line at low frequencies, there is no difficulty in extending it. In the case of my radio, the frequency is 630 kilocycles when the dial is turned to 100 degrees, which is F. Substituting the values of F and C into the formula, we get:</p>
<p>The value of L is found to be 0.00021 Henry, which is the inductance of the coil L.</p>
<p>When the dial of the capacitor is turned to zero degrees, the capacitance is not zero. From the calibration curve, we know that the frequency at this point is 1500 kilocycles. Substituting this into the formula again:</p>
<p>The value of C is found to be 0.00006 microfarads. Therefore, it is known that the capacitance of the Ame 3121 capacitor when the fixed and moving plates are completely separated is 0.00006 microfarads.</p>
<p>This method can be applied to the tuning circuit of any broadcast radio. However, the capacitance of variable capacitors made by manufacturers is not very accurate, so the results obtained will naturally have some errors.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Selection of Shortwave Wavelengths <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>The propagation state of shortwaves varies with wavelength (frequency), and there are cases where communication is completely impossible due to seasonal and nighttime conditions. Therefore, one should pay attention to selecting a certain wavelength (frequency) in a certain season or at a certain time. Regarding the appropriate selection in the amateur wavelength band (frequency band), it can be roughly divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) The 7,000 KC band and the 14,000 KC band are the most widely used, and nighttime long-distance experiments all utilize them, especially the 14,000 KC band is most suitable for daytime long-distance communication.</p>
<p>(2) The bands that are commonly used at night are 1,750 KC, 8,500 KC, 7,000 KC, and 14,000 KC. Among these, the 7,000 KC band is the most popular.</p>
<p>(3) For long-distance communication during the daytime in summer, the most suitable frequency bands are 28,000 KC and 14,000 KC. The 1,750 KC frequency band is best suited for communication within two to three hundred miles, as it is easier to oscillate and is suitable for use by beginners.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Underwater Radio <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jian</p>
<p>According to a scientific news report in the Soviet newspaper Pravda, the "Whale Ship" engineering unit, which is salvaging a sunken ship on the bottom of the Black Sea, has repeatedly tried underwater radio broadcasting over the years of salvage work, but without good results. However, they continued their research without slackening, and finally, at the end of December last year, they broadcast the message of victory from the seabed of the Black Sea using underwater radio. According to the person in charge of salvaging the sunken ship, they specially designed a waterproof and lightweight broadcasting and receiving set, attached to the back of a waterproof suit, which does not add much weight and is very functional, and can also broadcast and receive at any time and any place, so that they can establish extremely close communication with the shore.</p>
<p>When the first underwater radio was used for the launching ceremony, Maxim Mens (the commander-in-chief of salvaging the sunken ship) said: In his life of salvaging sunken ships, he had never seen such a difficult and arduous task as salvaging the "Whale Ship." Now, after a long period of struggle, we have invented this underwater radio, and it will be much easier to use it to direct all the work of salvaging the "Whale Ship." Now we are not only completely confident that the sunken "Whale Ship" can be completely salvaged, but also that our work in salvaging sunken ships can be called the best in the world. After he finished speaking, he ordered the salvage divers to broadcast the lyrics underwater: "We will conquer everything; we have conquered it. We will overcome everything; we have overcome it. Forward! Forward! The victory of science belongs to us..." All the listeners who heard this broadcast shouted "Long live!" and dispersed.</p>
<p>The major Moscow radio materials manufacturing plants are now actively rushing to produce the special materials needed for underwater radio, and are opening short-term crash courses to train this type of skilled personnel, in order to expand and improve all future salvage work.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Method for Restoring Demagnetized Earpieces <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Wenwei</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, I have seen many great works. Some use natural magnets to rub back and forth on the demagnetized magnetic poles to restore them. Some use electromagnets, with current flowing, to connect to the demagnetized magnetic poles to restore them. Both methods are good and can be used. However, after the author's experimentation, I feel that there are three drawbacks: (1) not easy to magnetize, (2) the magnetic force is not strong after magnetization, (3) very easy to lose magnetism after magnetization. I believe that readers who have tried it will feel the same way! Now I will publish the new method I discovered during the holidays for restoring magnetic force (1. inexpensive, 2. simple method, 3. everyone can do it, 4. strong magnetic force, 5. not easy to lose), for the reference of fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Restoration method: Take the black wire of the demagnetized earpiece and connect it to the ground wire (the person experimenting must stand on a stool to isolate the human body from the earth's atmosphere to avoid the danger of electric shock). Then, touch the red wire to the live wire of the electric light, and immediately remove it (if the time is too long, the thin wire inside the earpiece will be burned). The demagnetized earpiece will then be restored, just like new. (When connecting to the live wire of the electric light, if no spark is found, it is connected incorrectly and should be reversed). The author can guarantee that this method will not fail.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Contradictions on the Knowledge Line <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— He Sheng</p>
<p>The school opening date for the spring semester has long passed by more than ten days. However, Shanghai newspapers are still crowded with enrollment advertisements for primary and secondary schools, and this is the third or even fourth time they are recruiting. This tells us that there are many schools and teachers in Shanghai, but there is a lack of students. Why is this happening? The answer is because of the economic recession! The recession has made it impossible for most people to afford school fees.</p>
<p>However, the newspapers also reported that many primary schools in the Jiangzhe interior are owed salaries, with some owing eight months and others owing four or five months. The "sacred and noble" primary school teachers have nothing left but their stomachs, so they have all gone on strike. A certain county in Zhejiang originally had six primary schools. Since last winter, there have been strikes and suspensions, and not a single day has there been two schools in session at the same time. Many primary school students have no choice but to be idle. Isn't this the opposite of Shanghai, where there are schools and teachers but a lack of students? However, this is also because of the economic recession! Because the recession has affected several "dedicated funds" for the source of education funding.</p>
<p>The widespread recession has also affected bookstores. It is said that most of the bookstores in Shanghai lack cash. However, judging from the accounts, almost every one has a surplus. The surplus is in accounts receivable. Since they are still open, new books must be published; however, if the new books don't sell, they can only be piled up high in the press. If they do sell, what they get is also an account. To publish or not to publish? This is another contradiction.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, the readers (although this is only a very small circle) are crying out that there is nothing to read! Bookstore owners are trying to find new books that can have a wide readership, but the vast majority of readers often feel that there is nothing to read. This contradiction is also ridiculously severe.</p>
<p>Last year was the year of magazines. The excitement was unprecedented. However, according to surveys, the sales of various magazines have only fallen. Being able to maintain the original state without falling is considered excellent. This fact clearly points out that the increase in magazines is not directly proportional to the increase in readers. Then is it because the number of authors has increased? It is said that this is not entirely true either. The editors of magazines will tell you how few submissions are usable and how difficult it is to solicit articles. Isn't this another contradiction?</p>
<p>Contradictions on the knowledge line have never been as numerous and severe as they are now! If one puts in the effort to collect materials, this contradictory account can be said to be endless. If these contradictions cannot be resolved, any plan for reviving Chinese culture will be just an unfunded check. And these contradictions have a common root cause, which is the social recession and chaos!</p>
<h3 id="e216">What I Saw in Front of the Java Customs <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Feier</p>
<p>Having just crossed the sturdy plank bridge in front of the customs office onto the Banjir coast, I was blocked by a large crowd.</p>
<p>Malay youths and children were solemnly surrounding the open space in front of the customs office, while Chinese coolies and shop assistants were watching the main characters acting in the square with the attitude of onlookers, as if they were watching a play – the men of the Empire.</p>
<p>Pushing my way through the crowd, I saw several "masters of Asia" wearing wooden clogs and kimonos, pointing at the customs office and cursing angrily, with an unusually imposing and impassioned attitude.</p>
<p>"You, what small customs officer, dare to mess with us?" one cursed. The Malay language was enunciated very clearly, just like the English commonly used by the men of the Empire. However, because of anger, the syllables were bitten even more firmly, turning the unstressed syllables into sturdy copper and iron.</p>
<p>Another, grasping his hand, approached the entrance of the Shanghai Customs Office, and his cursing resounded throughout the entire Banjir coast:</p>
<p>"If you dare, come out in front of the customs office for a duel! We Japanese won't put a small Javanese customs officer in our eyes."</p>
<p>Another middle-aged man in his forties or fifties, seemed somewhat more amiable, but he stood in the middle of the square with his hands clasped, murmuring:</p>
<p>"See how they reckon with us. See if he dares to bully us!"</p>
<p>A-Xing stood on a pair of wooden boxes and asked a Malay man next to him:</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>The small, thin Malay man said in a gloomy, low voice (his voice was unusually low, as if he was afraid of being heard by the furious people):</p>
<p>"Who knows. Maybe it's about taxes. It is said that the Java customs officer levied too high a tax on a Japanese man's goods, and they started arguing in the customs office. So they gathered all five fellow countrymen in the city, leaving their wives and children to watch the store, and all came here to demonstrate."</p>
<p>A-Yu laughed loudly and said:</p>
<p>"You 'slaves of a fallen nation' deserve to be trampled on by wooden clogs."</p>
<p>These words stung the Malay youth somewhat. That one suddenly said excitedly:</p>
<p>"Even you 'Chinamen' are not necessarily not bullied by the Japanese, are you? We, we have the newly rising Turkey."</p>
<p>"No, we 'Chinese,' we dare to fight the Japanese."</p>
<p>Captain-Mr. felt a little annoyed when he heard these words. He frowned and urged us to leave quickly. On the one hand, he was already very tired; on the other hand, perhaps he felt that these arguments were a bit inappropriate?</p>
<p>Although I didn't see an end to the incident in front of the customs office, A-Xing dragged me away out of anger.</p>
<p>On the way, A-Yu still said angrily:</p>
<p>"Damn it, it's really a chaotic world - last year, a Japanese fishing boat rushed into the Lu River Customs Office in the middle of the night and caused it to sink. Our Chinese fishermen helped to salvage it. Wait for the customs office to come and ask afterwards, you know what they said?"</p>
<p>"We encountered wind at sea. We took refuge here. Your customs office doesn't even turn on the lights at night, how can we know where the customs office is hidden - now that the ship has sunk, you should also bear some responsibility."</p>
<p>"Damn it, encountered wind? If our Chinese ships barge in without declaring in the middle of the night, the ships won't be detained, but they'll have to pay a fine. And them, it is said that after the ships are repaired, the government gives them a subsidy."</p>
<p>"Damn it, thinking of the humiliating term 'Chinaman' really makes one angry!"</p>
<p>Captain-Mr. and I walked silently, not speaking for a while. After some consideration, Captain-Mr. finally came to the following conclusion:</p>
<p>"It's all because we are too disunited. Look at them, as soon as a small incident occurs, all five of them come out in full force."</p>
<p>"Are we not united? Why are we not united?" A-Xing asked back, a rational question suppressing his fiery emotions.</p>
<p>"Why should we be united?" I wanted to use K to refute, but I didn't say it.</p>
<p>We entered ×× Company, and some boring polite talk covered up these words.</p>
<h3 id="e217">The Courage of Writers <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Lai</p>
<p>Every writer with a sense of justice always mercilessly reveals the lining of reality: light or darkness; friends or enemies; in between, he never injects any embellishment or compromise.</p>
<p>However, for this reason, all the poverty and misery and tragic endings are always lurking around every writer with a sense of justice. From this phenomenon, it is clear how important the ability for a great writer to sacrifice is.</p>
<p>On the other hand, everyone knows that the road of writing is the most difficult. Especially in China, let alone the unknown writers; even the rewards of famous writers cannot liberate them from a life of poverty, as is well known. If we are planning for personal gain, needless to say, embarking on the road of writing is the most unfortunate thing.</p>
<p>There must be such writers; not to mention that they will not resent or be discouraged by the trivial hardships of daily life... Even if a great disaster befalls them, they can still bear it with the spirit of martyrdom; only such writers can truly understand the solemn meaning of the cause they are engaged in. And only such writers are worthy of being the drummers of the times.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Reading Zhao Qiuling's Ci Poems <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Shiji</p>
<p>I happened to read Zhao Qiuling's "Lamenting the West Wind in Chongqing," sent to Gui Danshu (Jin Lü Gao): "Mocking life is like filling a hole with dirt, wine cannot wash it away. Every chess piece is a wrong move from the start, it's a mistake to study so hard, binding so many feelings!" I couldn't help but feel the same, so I didn't overlook this author like I did other Ci poets of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>Zhao Qiuling's achievements are not particularly high, and the number of genuinely good works in his entire collection is very small, but in terms of the sincerity of his temperament, he is a rare figure in the Qing Dynasty. Even comparing him to Nalan Rongruo, he doesn't pale in comparison, because one is bold and unrestrained, and the other is gentle and melancholy, and I personally happen to prefer the bold and unrestrained sentiment. Qiuling's collection is not difficult to find in today's market, but very few people know Qiuling's name, which I find strange; but why is it strange? Qiuling once said in his inscription on Chen Xiaolu's collection (Jin Lü Qu): "It's a pity that the brush formation sweeps away a thousand people, but it's an ancient and common occurrence in the middle of it; the gauze hat in the Ci poetry arena. Whether it is passed down or not is purely accidental; are those who are passed down all masterpieces? Only the enlightened ones laugh it off. Such a talented person is unfairly erased, imagine how many are buried in obscurity. Just a commoner, who understands him!"</p>
<p>Regarding Qiuling's life story, from the prefaces and postscripts of his collection and the notes of his friend Liang Jinzhu, I only know that his courtesy name was Qingxi, and he was from Renhe. Born in 1803 (Jiaqing Xinwei). He passed the provincial examination in his youth, but did not enter the imperial academy. He then went to Hubei, where he published a volume of "Chu You Cao"; after returning home, he made a living by tutoring, living a life of disappointment for twenty years... He died as a guest in Lingnan in his second year of travel, and his works were burned in a fire. His female friend Wu Pingxiang compiled "Xiang Xiao Jiu Li Ci Qu" into separate volumes. However, I also know that he had the most common background of contemporary literati, that is, poverty, arrogance, weariness of the teaching life, and complaints of not being recognized, so his Ci poems are full of emotion. Like the second poem sent to Gui Danshu:</p>
<p>"It's almost Mid-Autumn again. Facing the blue sky, alas, I've failed to enjoy the round days; the cassia and osmanthus, and the flower fairies of Xiaoshan, all people in my eyes are thousands of miles away. It evokes countless tastes of separation. Swallows fly here and fly away again; I still remember what happened last year. My old garden is unharmed in the west wind, but I have failed to enjoy the willow trees, flowers and wine of the Six Bridges. How saddened is Axian with empty walls; it's hard to start a conversation about home, only reporting that the year is peaceful. I can't bear to beg for food again, lacking the skills to roam the world; poetry and wine, what's the use!"</p>
<p>The sorrow of a declining literati is generally written here.</p>
<p>Qiuling's Ci poems are explicit and clear when describing the scenery, and they have a unique charm, like the verses in "Traveling to Gaoting" (Tai Cheng Lu): "Lightly moving the wine boat, holding a new fishing rod, I learn the life of an old fisherman. Flowers bloom on the ridge, watching the wind pass and shake the coolness, the water marks are all purple. The houses on both sides, the paintings of Changmen close, it is the silkworm market. The green apricots on the branches are still small, only the mulberry shade and the pods are as fat as lard. The soil is slippery and the frogs are level, the shirt is remembered by the fan, and then passing the mountain temple in the setting sun." It vividly depicts the scenery of Jiangnan in late spring and early summer, which cannot be described as anything but genuine.</p>
<p>Qiuling also wrote flowery and ornate language when he was young. His small poems, his poems, and his songs mostly belong to this aspect. Those who liked it praised it as "entering and exiting the flowers," or "following the traces of Wen Tingyun and Li Shangyin," but this is precisely what we do not approve of. When he was in Hubei, his betrothed died, and he once wrote "Xu Li Sao Zhao Hun Ku Zhi," with the last verse (Huan Xi Sha) saying: "Checking my green shirt, there are tear stains, the most heartbreaking thing is ten years ago, drizzle and dusk everywhere. The parrot poem is a genius' blood, the peach blossom is a maiden's soul, I wonder where to mourn Xiang Jun." This is most representative of his work in the transitional phase of imitation.</p>
<p>Qiuling was devoted to friendship and made many friends. He and his friends, such as Liang Puzhu, Yao Gufen, Chen Xiaolu, and Xu Baochan, all had the same preferences, the same views, and the same experiences regarding literature. Later, they scattered and fell apart, and his situation naturally goes without saying. Qiuling has a letter to Liang Jinzhu, describing the various things before and after their separation. The last paragraph is extremely moving. I excerpt it here: "After middle age, life is filled with sorrow and no joy. I often think of the poetry society at your house and the wine society at Yao's house fifteen years ago, drinking freely and selecting rhymes, arranging banquets and judging flowers, believing that this joy was something our generation had not exhausted. Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, we've drifted apart like this! Old travels are like dreams, I regret not climbing to the top of Phoenix Mountain, scratching my head and asking the sky. However, if there are two of us in this world, this joy is still possible. I only hope that you cherish yourself on the edge of the world, I also do the same. All the friends in my hometown, Su Yun has not been seen, Minfu was seen once in April, and Fulu would like to see each other but cannot, Shusheng is often seen, Xun Yuan will never be seen again, Jinzhu can only be seen in books."</p>
<p>Qiuling and his friends were not famous in their time, and they could not avoid being full of complaints. Like Qiuling's inscription on Xu Baozhuang's collection (Bai Zi Ling), there are sentences like "There is hatred in this, it's hard to find a confidant in life!" "It's okay to speak madly, you all got your names for nothing!" We can know their indignation. Judging impartially, Qiuling and others can be considered authors who were reasonably independent in the Qing Dynasty poetry scene, and from his sentence "Blaming everyone for imitating Song and then imitating Tang, wrapping up like a stiff silkworm," we can see their eagerness to be independent. He also has a sentence praising Chen Xiaolu: "The whole page is filled with the shadows of white seedlings and autumn water, and the spirit of fallen flowers and mountain forests, beyond Su Shi, Liu Yong, Qin Guan, and Huang Tingjian." I think it's appropriate to use these few sentences as the conclusion to describe him here, it will definitely not be an overestimation or inappropriate.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Jin Jiu's Dad <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>Since last spring, Jin Jiu's dad began to cough strangely.</p>
<p>He was a middle-aged man, tall, with a neck that was also so long, setting off an even smaller waist. Whether he was wearing a single jacket or a short cotton coat, he always wore a blue cloth belt around his waist. His eating tools were a large box of wooden figures and a stage with a blue cloth curtain underneath. The blue cloth curtain was just enough for Jin Jiu's dad to fit in. While he was tossing those small wooden figures, he was shouting and singing with a hoarse voice, sometimes sharp and piercing, sometimes scratchy like a broken Huqin without rosin.</p>
<p>Every day, he carried the heavy load and wandered through the alleys, knocking on a small gong, looking for customers along some unfamiliar or familiar alleys. Sometimes, he would walk past the doors of some houses with children and tempt them to watch the puppet show every day. Jin Jiu's dad would be scolded by some women, who blamed him for coming every day to trick them out of their copper coins.</p>
<p>"It's already fallen to the price of thirty coins per show!"</p>
<p>Although he argued like that, Jin Jiu's dad still had to lower his head and slip away down another street. He breathed lightly, calculating the exchange rate. In previous years, when it was 30 strings per silver dollar, one show cost 4 strings, which was a little more than one dime. Now it was more than 50 strings per dollar.</p>
<p>"The more effort, the poorer I get!" Thinking like that, he hurriedly finished performing in one place and wiped the sweat before running to another, hoping to make up for the depreciated money by performing more shows. The few mouths at home hadn't reduced their food intake. However, when he only heard the echo of his own hand knocking on the small gong in the alley and didn't hear the call of an employer, Jin Jiu's dad raised his gray eyes and absentmindedly thought:</p>
<p>"Everyone seems to be poor."</p>
<p>However, he also clearly remembered that when he crossed a major road to change the direction of wandering the alleys, he clearly saw crowds of spectators pouring into the cinemas and theaters like clouds.</p>
<p>Hesitating and puzzled, he lingered, with his anxious heart selling his skills. Sometimes he would let a few coins go, or else he would perform a few more scenes to make up for it.</p>
<p>"Dudu, Aiyo..."</p>
<p>Singing with all his might, interspersed with dialogues, his plays often included "Grandma Wang Sawing the Jar" and "Pigsy Sweeping Women," and sometimes he would also mention "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."</p>
<p>Jin Jiu's dad's back gradually bent down, and his slender neck stretched out. His voice became even more hoarse, but when he saw Jin Jiu next to his mother complaining that he wasn't full with the cornbread, he made a black mark in his heart, muttering that he would perform two more shows tomorrow so that the family could have a few more cornbreads to eat.</p>
<p>He extended his working hours, spending less time at home in the morning playing with wooden figures with his child, and not returning until it was dark at night.</p>
<p>Feeling that he was getting weaker and weaker, and that his legs would be tired and sore in less than half a day, Jin Jiu's dad cursed himself inwardly, saying that he was still a middle-aged man! However, what he couldn't hide was the dizziness after walking too much. Once, after performing two times in a row, he stumbled and fell on the carrying pole, and his eyes went dark for a moment, almost falling down.</p>
<p>Slowly, the coughing came, just a little bit in the throat, but it took a lot of effort.</p>
<p>The woman noticed this phenomenon.</p>
<p>The man shook his head: "Caught a cold!"</p>
<p>He couldn't hide it from the woman's sharp eyes. She had seen neighbors with this illness, and who had died because of this illness. Something threatened her:</p>
<p>"Consumption!"</p>
<p>She rang the bell at the Guandi Temple.</p>
<p>She also got a free prescription from somewhere and gave it to the man to drink with water. (To be continued)</p>

<p>In our country, telegrams to and from various places in South China are centered on Guangzhou. The circuit (A) transmitted by cable is: (1) starting from Shanghai, passing through the Shanghai-Fujian direct line to Fuzhou, and then through Xiamen and Shantou to Guangzhou. (2) Starting from Hankou, passing through Jiujiang, Nanchang, Ganzhou, crossing the Dayuling Mountains to Shaozhou, and then to Guangzhou. (3) Starting from Hankou, passing through Changsha, Hengzhou, Chenzhou, Shaozhou, and then to Guangzhou; or passing through Hengzhou, Yongzhou, Guilin, Wuzhou to Guangzhou. (B) There are two ways of transmitting by wireless telegraph: (1) Direct line between Guangdong and Hubei, (2) Direct line between Shanghai and Guangzhou. (C) The line transmitted by submarine cable is provided by the foreign-owned Great Northern Telegraph Company, which reaches Hong Kong through the Shanghai-Hong Kong submarine cable, and then transfers to Guangzhou. This is the general situation of the South China circuit.</p>
<p>It is found that the above-mentioned cable circuits have been destroyed by bandits and communists and have been in disrepair for many years. The direct line between Guangdong and Hubei (via the Guangxun Han circuit) has been blocked for more than 20 years. The remaining routes are fragmented and have never been opened for direct communication. In recent years, the pole lines in the three provinces of Hunan, Fujian, and Jiangxi have been repaired in time due to military progress, but the construction is crude and the work is not strong, so it cannot be directly communicated. Transferring telegrams delays time. If it is interrupted by weather or bandits, it is even more of a delay. Therefore, in the past, domestic merchants sent telegrams to South China, and because of their accuracy and reliability, they were more willing to pay the submarine cable fee and transfer them through the Shanghai-Hong Kong submarine cable. For decades, the loss of interests has been incalculable! After the establishment of wireless telegraph stations in Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangzhou, and the opening of direct lines between Shanghai-Guangdong and Guangdong-Hubei, many rights and interests were recovered. However, due to the limited capacity of the generators, if all the telegrams from South China are transferred through the two lines, it is actually difficult to do so, and it will inevitably lead to congestion and delays.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate north-south telecommunications, the Ministry of Communications has selected the fastest route between Guangdong and Hubei (ie, the Changheng Shaoguang line), actively reorganized it, and added pole lines to achieve direct communication. The lines in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces are also being repaired. The Hunan-Guangdong line project started in June last year. It was disrupted by the Jiangxi bandits intruding into Hunan. It was completed in January this year. The direct line between Guangdong and Hubei was reported on February 11, and the results are very good. The telegrams coming and going are fast and accurate. The line blocked for more than 20 years between Guangdong and Hubei is now opened and completed by Hunan Province. From now on, news from South China will reach the Central Plains in an instant, which will make a great contribution to national communications.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Thoughts After Reorganizing the Old Debts of the Telecommunications Administration <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Hao</p>
<p>During the era of the Ministry of Communications of the former Beijing government, various telecommunications debt loans were successively borrowed from foreign merchants in Japan, Britain, Germany, the United States, and other countries. The amount was huge. The contract terms were extremely harsh, the interest rate was high, and there were even provisions for paying interest in advance. Over the years, the Ministry of Communications has been unable to meet the telecommunications debt repayments. The amount of foreign debt repaid was very small. Not to mention the principal, even the interest paid was less than one-tenth. As a result, the principal and interest were compounded, and the debt increased day by day. As of the end of 1934, the total debt, including principal and interest, converted into national currency at the current gold price, totaled more than 80 million yuan. All the chief officials of the Ministry of Communications have been wary of this debt and have not been able to find a solution to reorganize it. Since Zhu Jia-hua took office as the head of the department, he realized that this debt had been pending for a long time, and the principal and interest would accumulate more and more. If a proper method was not devised to solve it as soon as possible, the entire telecommunications industry would go bankrupt. Therefore, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, personnel were dispatched to handle the matter. After several months of negotiations, new repayment methods were separately agreed with each creditor. The creditors gave up all their inherent rights. This kind of understanding attitude is worthy of our praise, and Marco Min's representative said that it is based on the Sino-British Gengkuan method, which can promote diplomatic relations between the two countries, which is especially sincere. Therefore, the result of this debt reorganization is not only that the principal and interest are repaid, but also tens of millions of yuan are saved compared with the old contract, and the diplomatic relations of our country have also been greatly improved. It cannot be said that it is not an extraordinary event in our telecommunications industry in recent years! The detailed methods have been recorded in various newspapers, so I will not repeat them here. I am writing my feelings to provide research for those who are concerned about the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' accumulated old debts for various telecommunications projects are the crux of the telecommunications economy's inability to consolidate, and the pain and constraints suffered by our telecommunications industry for more than ten years have been the most severe. Although all the previous telecommunications authorities knew that the telecommunications future would not be secured unless the above-mentioned old debts were resolved, the debts were too large and there was no way to reorganize them. Therefore, although demands for repayment were pressing, they were always dealt with through evasive and delaying means as a temporary measure. Little did they know that creditors and debts are clearly stipulated by law, and when it comes to foreign merchants, it is related to international credit. If you are not careful in dealing with it occasionally, and do not seek fundamental solutions, the impact will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>In the contracts for various telecommunications loans, such as the loan contract for expanding telephone collaboration signed by the Old Ministry of Communications and the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company, and the joint venture between the Western Electric Company and the China Electric Company, there are provisions for priority in purchasing materials. Since the methods were contradictory, disputes arose as a result; for example, if materials were ordered from Company A, Company B would come out and interfere on the grounds of priority rights. If materials were ordered from Company B, Company A would also raise objections on the same grounds. If materials were purchased from material merchants other than Companies A and B, the accusations would be even heavier. All of these kinds of things, the Ministry of Communications often had the pain of being unable to cope with. And because the debts had not been repaid for a long time and credit was lost, the company often secretly increased the price of materials. The Ministry of Communications, due to contractual relations, although it knew the loss clearly, had to endure the pain and accept it. Therefore, the loss on telecommunications materials purchased over the years cannot be counted, this is one. Furthermore, the successive telecommunications authorities were concerned about the telecommunications debt, but since the debt had never been reorganized, there was no accurate figure. It was unknown to what extent the accumulated debt was. Therefore, the entire telecommunications budget could not be established. And because of the harsh conditions of the various contracts, various new facilities were restricted, which led to repeated obstacles and made it difficult to develop. This is two. Among the various telecommunications debts, the largest amount and the most serious nature are: One is the loan for expanding and improving cable telegraph engineering costs borrowed from the Japanese merchant Dongya Xingye Co., Ltd. by the former Ministry of Communications on February 10, 1920, totaling 10,222,020 yen and 47 sen, with the entire property of the cable telegraph as collateral. One is the loan for expanding telephone borrowed from the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company by the Old Ministry of Communications in October 1918, totaling 10 million yen, which was mortgaged with the existing and future expanded telephone property and application rights. Later, the Old Ministry of Communications continued to purchase materials from the company and increased the amount owed by approximately 6.5 million yen. Although the above two loans have been repaid by the Ministry of Communications one after another, the amount is very small, insufficient to pay the interest. Therefore, as of the end of last year, the accumulated principal and interest combined exceeded more than twice the principal. If this situation continues indefinitely, it will inevitably accumulate more and more. If the creditors feel that the debt cannot be recovered, and their grief and anger come together, and they turn to rely on the power of their country to demand the disposal of the collateral, we really have no way to deal with it. Looking to the future, we cannot help but tremble with fear, this is three.</p>
<p>With these three reasons, I know that although the telecommunications authorities have worked hard with an indomitable spirit in recent years, heading towards the road of reform and revitalization, everyone's hearts are uneasy with the huge debt in front of them and the crises all around. Now all the debts have been satisfactorily resolved, and the harsh conditions have been completely abolished, which is no different from someone who has been shackled for a long time being freed. The joy and comfort cannot be described in words! From now on, the thorns have been cleared away, the hidden worries have been eliminated, and all kinds of plans can be carried out step by step without any worries or constraints. Therefore, the clearing of telecommunications debts has a epoch-making significance in the entire telecommunications history, and the far-sighted and brilliant insights and the wise and decisive spirit of the current authorities are worthy of admiration and praise.</p>
<p>From now on, I sincerely hope that all sectors of society will share the difficulties and dangers and contribute their sincerity. For the previously owed telephone bills, they should find ways to repay them, and for all future telecommunications fees, they must pay in cash as required. The telecommunications economy can be revived, and the debt reorganization plan formulated by the Ministry of Communications this time will not be interrupted. The future of the country will rely on it, and it is not just the telecommunications industry!</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Process and Impact of Signing the Shanghai Long-Distance Telephone Connection Contract <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Cang Zhou</p>
<p>Local telephones and long-distance telephones, one is for short-distance communication, and the other is for long-distance communication. Both have their own effects. However, long-distance telephones cannot develop without local telephones as their intermediary, and local telephones must have long-distance telephones for their promotion before their functions become more apparent. They must cooperate closely, like vehicles relying on each other, to reach a situation where one can speak to someone thousands of miles away as if they were in the same room.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest port in our country, holding the hub of national commerce and finance. Surrounding it are southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang, and there are many political and commercial cities. Therefore, the connection and communication between local telephones and long-distance telephones in Shanghai is extremely necessary. However, long-distance telephones are operated by the Ministry of Communications, and local telephones in the concession are operated by foreign merchants. The different operating entities cause the connection problem to arise.</p>
<p>The connection between local telephones in the Shanghai concession and long-distance telephones began in May 1926, when the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications signed a long-distance telephone contract with the Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company. This contract was based on the Sino-Foreign Telephone Communication Contract signed in 1925. Regarding the charging method, it was stipulated that company users using long-distance telephones, regardless of whether they were calling out or calling in, the company could charge an additional 5 dimes per call as a handling fee. In May 1932, the contract expired. The Ministry of Communications immediately sent personnel to negotiate with the Shanghai Telephone Company (which inherited the China and Foreign Telephone Company to operate the concession telephone) to renew the new contract. However, since the Sino-Foreign Telephone Communication Contract on which the original contract was based had expired and a new contract had not yet been signed, it was inconvenient to resolve the long-distance telephone connection contract first, and this case was shelved. Until April 1933, the temporary contract for telephones in the Chinese and Concession areas was officially signed, and the Ministry of Communications sent personnel to continue negotiations with the company, but there was no result for a long time.</p>
<p>The signing of the new contract this time was initiated by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's request to increase relay lines. The long-distance telephone traffic in Shanghai has developed extremely far, and the concession accounts for 80 to 90 percent of it. There are currently 15 pairs of long-distance lines connected to the Shanghai Long-Distance Station: 5 pairs along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line, 6 pairs along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway line, 2 pairs along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and 2 pairs along the Shanghai-Songjiang line. There are only 8 pairs of relay lines between China and the concession. It can be imagined that 8 pairs of relay lines are not enough to handle 15 pairs of long-distance lines. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau repeatedly requested the telephone company to increase the number of relay lines. The telephone company proposed the issue of contract renewal, and believed that the increase in relay lines was a prerequisite, so the negotiations continued. The point of contention between the two parties was the company's method of sharing telephone fees. The Ministry of Communications wanted to maintain the original plan, that is, the company would share 5 cents per call regardless of incoming or outgoing calls. The company wanted to share 15% of the total telephone fees for outgoing calls, with a minimum of 10 cents and a maximum of 1 yuan and 50 cents, and 5% for incoming calls, with a minimum of 5 cents and a maximum of 1 yuan and 50 cents. Finally, both parties compromised and agreed that the company would receive 10% for outgoing calls and 5% for incoming calls, with the minimum and maximum limits being 5 cents and 1 yuan and 50 cents respectively. On the 7th of this month, the telephone bureau and the telephone company officially signed the contract.</p>
<p>The results of signing the contract: The most important ones are the addition of relay lines and the increase in the company's share of fees. According to the current long-distance telephone traffic in Shanghai, the Beijing-Shanghai line is the busiest. The Ministry of Communications built new long-distance lines along the highway in the shortest possible time, originally hoping that the Beijing-Shanghai telephone traffic could be expedited. However, after the new line was completed, the Beijing-Shanghai telephone traffic was still congested. Since the long-distance relay lines in Shanghai could not be increased, the newly added Beijing-Shanghai line was just a formality. Now that the new contract has been signed, the number of relay lines can be increased, and the telephone traffic in all directions will definitely be smooth. Secondly, regarding the company's share of telephone fees, the telephone company's hopes were quite extravagant this time. Although the Ministry of Communications negotiated and reduced the fees, the final result was quite different from the original plan. In the future, the handling fees paid by the Ministry of Communications to the telephone company every month will undoubtedly increase significantly. However, the Ministry of Communications emphasizes increasing revenue. The two parties have different goals.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Joint Political and Military Organs Suppress Private Use of Official Telegrams <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>I have read Traffic Gazette No. 617, which contains a letter from the Political Training Department of the Nanchang Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission to the Ministry of Transportation, stating roughly: "We received a letter stating that the Political Training Department of the 11th Division used the official telegraph paper of this department to send private telegrams, requesting an investigation, admonishment, and a general order for suppression, etc., along with a copy of the original telegram; this is confirmed. The individual surnamed Li (the reporter withholds the name for now) who privately used official telegrams has been dismissed and is under investigation. This department has already issued a general order to suppress private use of official telegrams," etc. It also contains a telegraph from the Western Route Headquarters of the Bandit Suppression Army of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei, dated November of last year, stating: "We previously received a telegraph stating that the Changsha Telegraph Bureau detained two official telegrams related to private matters from Chaling, requesting an investigation to identify the sender and issue a reprimand, etc. We immediately telegraphed Army Commander Liu Jianxu to investigate and reply. Now, according to Army Commander Liu's reply telegraph, 'We have respectfully received your telegraph and have complied with your order to reprimand the sender and instructed subordinates not to send private telegrams again. We hereby report this,' etc." Reading this letter and telegram, we can see how seriously the current political and military authorities regard telecommunications laws and regulations.</p>
<p>It has long been the case that private matters cannot be sent using official telegrams. The National Government issued a general order to all political and military organs to comply with this in the 18th year of the Republic [1929], and the Ministry of Transportation also stipulated methods and announced them to the public. However, two years ago, during times of military urgency, officials in various political and military organs were unaware of telecommunications laws and regulations. They often used printed telegram paper to send official telegrams for private matters. When confronted, they became aggressive and intimidating. If the telegram was detained and not sent, they would roar and even threaten with "delaying military operations." Telegraph bureau personnel, subjected to their coercion, had no choice but to temporarily accept and send the telegrams, while reporting to the Ministry of Transportation for instructions. Official correspondence took time. By the time the Ministry's reply arrived, the official had already been transferred elsewhere with the agency. Seeing that they could use force to send private official telegrams at Telegraph Bureau A, the official would do the same at Telegraph Bureau B or C. Gradually, they came to regard it as a right enjoyed by military personnel, lending printed telegram paper to non-military personnel for sending telegrams. Unscrupulous staff members in the bureau used printed telegram paper in place of merchants' telegrams. All sorts of abuses arose, becoming a common practice. The losses from telegram fees were incalculable. This situation was especially prevalent during times of military activity or in remote locations, as this reporter has repeatedly witnessed.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Ministry of Transportation has strictly suppressed private use of official telegrams and stipulated measures for reporting bureaus, intermediate bureaus, and receiving bureaus to investigate and detain private telegrams, along with rewards and penalties. Telegraph bureau personnel also consider suppressing private telegrams to be an essential measure for streamlining telecommunications administration and are working hard to implement it with remarkable results. The following is a table listing the number of private telegrams detained in each district in the 21st and 22nd years of the Republic [1932 and 1933]:</p>
<p>Table of Private Telegrams Detained in Each District in the 21st and 22nd Years of the Republic.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that private official telegrams cannot escape investigation and detention. Now, with the assistance of political and military organs, offenders will be dismissed and investigated. Political and military personnel will realize that this type of telegram will certainly be detained and that sending it will certainly be punished. They will not risk significant losses for petty gains. Private official telegrams may disappear from telegraph bureaus altogether.</p>
<h3 id="e225">The Use of Roman Alphabet Telegraph Codes <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>—Attention Overseas Compatriots—</p>
<p>The "Newly Compiled Clear and Cipher Telegraph Codes" published by the Ministry of Transportation contains a type of Roman alphabet telegraph code (i.e., Western language telegraph code) in addition to the more common telegraph code books sold on the market. Each three letters represents one Chinese character. The only advantage of this code is that it saves on telegram fees. Overseas compatriots sending telegrams to their home country can save 64% on telegram fees, which is more economical than using Western language telegrams. Examples are provided below:</p>
<p>For example, the five characters "Goods arrived, remit payment quickly." If sent using Chinese four-character codes, they would be translated as 6303 0451 2949 6643 0565, a total of five codes. Each code is charged at the full price of one character. Assuming the price per character is one yuan, the fee would be five yuan. If sent using the Roman alphabet telegraph code, the five characters can be translated as RAO ARJ HUS SGL AVT, five codes. Then, these five codes are combined into RAOARJHUSSGIAV and divided into three codes, five letters each: RAOAR JHUSS GIAVT. These three codes are charged as three characters and are eligible for a 60% discount, resulting in a fee of only 1.80 yuan. Comparing the two methods, the difference in telegram fees is 3.20 yuan, demonstrating the benefits of using the Roman alphabet telegraph code.</p>
<p>However, users of this code must pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>1.  Before sending telegrams to relatives, friends, or related businesses, purchase several copies of the "Newly Compiled Clear and Cipher Telegraph Codes" published by the Ministry of Transportation and give them to relatives, friends, or people with whom you intend to exchange telegrams, and inform them of the usage of this code (the book contains instructions). It is best to try translating it once by mail to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>2.  This code can only be used for the telegram text. The names and addresses of the recipients in the telegram should still be in Western or Chinese clear code to ensure that the telegraph bureau can deliver the telegram.</p>
<p>3.  If a telegram is sent from abroad to the home country and the sender has not notified the recipient to use this code in advance, the word "PDAIN" can be added before the telegram text to indicate that the telegram is in Roman alphabet telegraph code. Upon receipt, the telegraph bureau will translate it into text according to the Chinese clear code telegram procedure and deliver it. However, this is limited to telegrams from abroad, as foreign telegraph bureaus are not responsible for translation.</p>
<p>4.  If the telegram text contains only four characters, it will be translated into twelve Roman letters (three letters per character). Then, divide it into codes of five letters each, resulting in two codes, with two letters remaining. These two letters can also be treated as one code, as Western language codes must not exceed five letters per code. If there are fewer than five letters, it can also be treated as one code.</p>
<p>5.  The "Newly Compiled Clear and Cipher Telegraph Codes" compiled and printed by the Ministry of Transportation is priced at 20 cents per copy. Local telegraph bureaus and radio stations sell them. If they are sold out, you can write directly to the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing to purchase them. If you have any questions about the code, you can write directly to this newspaper, and we will provide a detailed reply.</p>
<p>6.  Domestic telegrams do not have a 60% discount for Western language codes, and Western language telegrams are more expensive than Chinese telegrams. For example, the five characters "Goods arrived, remit payment quickly" cost only 50 cents at the Chinese rate. If converted into a three-character Western language code, it would cost 60 cents, which is uneconomical. Therefore, it is not advisable to use this code.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Convenience of Sending Telegrams via Telephone <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation has established "Measures for Receiving and Sending Telegrams via City Telephone" to facilitate telegram reception and sending for city telephone users, which has been implemented since February 1st of last year. According to these measures, city telephone users who wish to use the telephone to receive and send telegrams can apply for registration at the local telegraph bureau or radio station, agree on a password, and prepay enough fees for half a month of telegrams before starting to receive and send telegrams. (However, telephone users who do not wish to send telegrams by telephone do not need to prepay telegram fees.) These measures are thorough and well-planned, and are very convenient for telephone users who exchange a lot of telegrams. However, telephone users who exchange fewer telegrams may find the registration fee and prepayment of telegram fees a little troublesome. If they do not follow these procedures, the telegraph bureau or radio station cannot accommodate them due to the regulations. Therefore, while these measures are convenient for telephone users who exchange a lot of telegrams, they are not universally available to ordinary telephone users.</p>
<p>Recently, the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Transportation has introduced "Measures for Telephone Bureau Users to Send Telegrams via Telephone" (see the February 10th Shen Bao) to address the above shortcomings. The telephone bureau has installed two telephones in the telegraph bureau's telegraph room for the exclusive use of the telegraph bureau to listen to telegrams sent by telephone users. According to these measures, city telephone users do not need to register with the local telegraph bureau or radio station. They only need to agree on a password and prepay telegram fees. They can dial telephone number ××××× (the dedicated telephone installed in the telegraph bureau's telegraph room) at any time to speak with the telegraph bureau's receiving operator and send telegrams. After the telegraph bureau's receiving operator has finished recording the telegram, they can assign a telegraph number and send it to the operator on duty according to the route the telegram should take to its destination. The procedure is extremely fast. The required telegram fee can be temporarily recorded by the telegraph bureau, and the telephone bureau will collect it from the user at the end of the month, which is even more convenient. From now on, telephone users can send telegrams at any time without leaving their homes, which is extremely simple and convenient. It is reported that these measures are being piloted in Shanghai and Tianjin first. Once they prove effective, they will be implemented in other major cities. This reporter hopes that in the future, telephone users in major cities will all be able to send telegrams at any time using the telephone, so that the two communication tools of telephone and telegraph can work together to serve the public more effectively. Please contact your local telegraph bureau for details of these measures.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Reply to Mr. Gu Qun's Inquiry from Shanghai <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Gu inquiring about the method of calculating fees for Western language telegrams. We hereby provide separate answers to the questions raised:</p>
<p>Question: (1) I used to send many Western language international telegrams when I was in Beiping. For all these telegrams, the recipient's name and address were often written as Chineselegation or Sinolegation, which were always charged as one word, regardless of the country to which the telegram was sent. Why is it that recently, when sending Western language telegrams from Shanghai to Beiping and other countries, the telegraph bureau charges each of the following words used in the recipient's name and address: Britishlegation, Frenchlegation, Spanishlegation, Sinolegation, etc., as two words? What is the basis for this? Please explain.</p>
<p>Answer: According to regulations, words written together in Western language telegrams should be charged separately, unless they can be proven to be registered telegraphic addresses, whether in the address, text, or signature. The words Britishlegation, Frenchlegation, Spanishlegation, Sinolegation, Chineselegation, etc., used in the recipient's name and address of the Western language telegrams you sent from Shanghai to Beiping and other countries, are words written together and are not the registered telegraphic addresses of the recipients. (Our embassies abroad have the registered telegraphic address Sinolegate. The registered telegraphic addresses of the British Embassy in China are Prodrome and Britatin. The registered telegraphic address of the French Embassy in China is Legafrance. The registered telegraphic address of the Spanish Embassy is not known.) Because the Roman letters contained in these words are all more than ten, they clearly conflict with the section of the regulations regarding telegraphic addresses for Western language telegrams that states, "Telegraphic addresses for Western language telegrams are limited to a maximum of ten Roman letters." There may be some misunderstanding in your letter. Perhaps the international telegrams you sent in Beiping used the registered telegraphic address Sinolegate instead of the recipient's name and address, and not the words written together Sinolegation, Chineselegation. Therefore, the telegraph bureau charged according to the regulations as one word. For the telegrams sent from Shanghai to Beiping and other countries, the words written together Sinolegation, Chineselegation, etc., used as the recipient's name and address, should be charged as two words according to the regulations. The telegraph bureau's request for additional fees is in accordance with Section 9, Paragraph 1 of Article 18 of Chapter 6 of the Telegraph Regulations attached to the International Telecommunications Convention, "Words that are combined or altered and violate the customary usage of the language to which they belong shall not be permitted." (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e228">Bi-Weekly News <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Fellow of the Newspaper</p>
<p>Shanghai and Tianjin Open Telephone Telegram Service</p>
<p>To facilitate telephone users in Shanghai and Tianjin in sending telegrams, the Ministry of Transportation has formulated telephone telegram measures. Telephone users in Shanghai and Tianjin can use telephones to send telegrams at any time without prior registration or deposit. The procedure is simple and convenient. When a user sends a telegram, they only need to dial the telephone number specified by the telegraph bureau (Shanghai Telephone Bureau specifies South City 21193 and 21194). After the call is connected, they report the telephone number and registered name, and then hang up the telephone and wait for the telegraph bureau to call. When the call is connected, the telegraph bureau will ask for the name once and then read out the telegram word by word or code by code. After the telegraph bureau records the telegram word by word, it will repeat it once. If the proofreading is correct, the telegram will be sent. After the telegram is sent, a copy of the telegram with the amount of the telegram fee to be paid will be sent to the original telegraph sender for review, signature and stamp and then the messenger will bring the copy back to the telegraph bureau for record, and all telegram fees payable will be collected at the end of the month. This measure allows the telegram sender to send telegrams without leaving home. Its convenience is comparable to that of European and American countries. This shows that the telecommunications authorities have recently been striving to commercialize the telegraph business. (Detailed measures can be obtained from the Shanghai or Tianjin Telegraph Bureau)</p>
<p>Measures for Charging Telegram Copy Fees</p>
<p>If there are more than two recipients in the same place, the sender can send a telegram with copies to save money. This type of telegram is charged as one telegram, but a copy fee must be charged. The copy fee was originally calculated according to the number of copies added. For example, if there are three recipients, then a copy fee of three copies will be charged. If each copy is 20 cents, the fee will be 60 cents. However, according to Article 61 of the current International Telegraph Regulations, the copy fee should be calculated according to the number of recipients. For example, if three copies are sent, the fee will be 60 cents. The reason for this is that the receiving telegraph bureau does not send a complete copy of the incoming telegram when sending the telegram. According to the regulations, three copies of the incoming telegram paper should be prepared, and each copy should only contain the name and address of one recipient and the text of the telegram, so that the recipient does not know that the sender has also sent the telegram to others. Therefore, the telegraph bureau's procedures are indeed to make three copies, not to add two copies. In order to unify the method of charging copy fees for international and domestic telegrams, the Ministry of Communications has ordered all telegraph bureaus to calculate the fees according to the number of copies sent from March 1.</p>
<p>Cancellation of Long-Distance Telephone Deposit</p>
<p>According to regulations, telephone users of each telephone bureau need to pre-pay a deposit when using long-distance telephones to avoid arrears of long-distance call charges. Although this measure provides a relatively stable guarantee for the telephone bureau's charging, it is always inconvenient for users to pre-pay the deposit. In order to facilitate users and promote business development, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the telephone bureaus in the capital city and Shanghai to conduct a pilot project. If the results of the pilot project are very good, the other telephone bureaus will also promote the implementation of the pilot project.</p>
<p>Legislative Yuan Passes International Telecommunication Convention</p>
<p>The International Telecommunication Convention and its related regulations passed by the International Telegraph and Radio Conference in Xijing, Madrid in 1932 should be approved by the governments of each contracting country. After our country signed the convention, the Ministry of Communications submitted the original case to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, which has been passed by the Yuan at the first meeting of the fourth session of the Legislative Yuan on February 8, and will be submitted to the National Government for approval in the near future to complete the formalities.</p>

<h3 id="e229">The Construction of Chinese Culture <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>After reading the "Declaration on the Construction of Chinese Culture with Chinese Standards," we seem to have discovered a glimmer of light in the future of Chinese culture!</p>
<p>When the British literary giant George Bernard Shaw traveled to China a few years ago, he made the following criticism of our country's culture: "China has no culture." Does China really have no culture? Is China really a country without culture? What exactly is the meaning of Shaw's statement? What kind of explanation does he give for the nature of culture? We really cannot know!</p>
<p>China is an ancient civilization and a cultural country nurtured by 5,000 years of history! We dare to boast like this. We are not exaggerating in doing so: because Chinese culture occupies a very important position in the field of world culture. However, this is past glory; what kind of situation has it become now?</p>
<p>In that declaration, it is pointed out at the beginning: "In the field of culture, we cannot see present-day China"! This is today's China. Shaw's judgment that "China has no culture" is not without considerable insight. As a result, the Chinese people feel depressed, groping around aimlessly, struggling desperately! Some are advocating "restoration" and drilling into the tombs of the ancients, trying to beg for inspiration from skeletons: some are clamoring for "welcoming the new", vying for the dregs of Westernization, hoping to pick out a little "life-saving elixir" in the dregs. But the result is the same disappointment!</p>
<p>So, is Chinese culture just going to be allowed to perish like this? Absolutely not! Although Chinese culture is now mired in an atmosphere of smog and desolation: we should embrace a firm and fearless spirit, overcome all difficulties, and build a new culture from this atmosphere! To engage in the construction of a new culture, we should make efforts in three aspects: reviewing the past of China, grasping the present of China, and building the future of China.</p>
<p>The new culture of China is a culture with Chinese standards. This kind of culture should be in line with the times and the environment, and it should be suitable for our needs. A group of restorationists believe that all ancient thoughts and systems are beautiful and good: so they advocate that everything should take the ancient as the model, which neglects the sense of the times. As for those who advocate embracing the new, they believe that all new and strange things in Europe and the United States are excellent: we should imitate them as much as possible. This again neglects the sense of space. It must be known that ancient culture has good and evil: European and American culture has advantages and disadvantages. And the choice of a kind of cultural relic suitable for ancient culture, and the absorption of European and American culture, are those that are the essence and meet the needs of the times and the environment. Then preserve it and take it: those that are rough and unsuitable for the needs of the times and the environment, then abolish it and discard it. This is what those who bear the responsibility of building China's new culture in the future must pay attention to.</p>
<p>We hope that after the successful construction of China's new cultural theory, not only will Chinese culture be able to restore its past glory and stand side by side with foreign countries; it will also be able to make valuable contributions to world culture!</p>
<h3 id="e230">New Fengchun <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>New Fengchun is the Beijing-Guangzhou general store next door to my house, and it is also the only department store in our town. Lao Guan is an honest merchant who is called a Laughing Buddha—he has been called that since I can remember, and his real surname has gradually been forgotten. In fact, this title is most suitable for him: he is an overweight fat man, and his protruding belly can be victorious over that of a woman about to give birth. On summer nights, he would bare his upper body and cool off in front of the door. When his arms, as thick as small tree roots, waved a palm-leaf fan, the fat on the back of his head and beside his breasts surged like waves. However, the most pictorial part was his pair of eyes that were always squinting into a line and his pair of flat, wide mouths. He came to our town in the first year of the Republic [1912], rented the remaining house of my family's uncle next door, and lived a single life running a small candy stall.</p>
<p>By the time I went home from school every day and used the copper coins my mother gave me to buy candy from his store, it already had the rudimentary form of a rural town general store. He often told the story of his struggle during this period as a moving story: there is a joke in our hometown: those who have not heard the story of Laughing Buddha are not people of our town.</p>
<p>This joke is something Laughing Buddha is proud of: but he is not complacent. After he got married, he and his wife worked even harder and more frugally. I remember very clearly that the black dates I took to school to fill my stomach when I went to high school in the city were also bought from his store. The sign of New Fengchun seemed to have been hung up at that time. According to what he told people himself, the sign was still what he had been using when he set up a stall in the town, but at first it was just used on the back. As for why he brought this sign with him like a treasure, it also evoked a story from him. It was about the year of the Restoration [1912], when he was an apprentice in a southern goods store in Shanghai. On the night of the attack on the arsenal, he saved his life with this sign. The three characters New Fengchun were the sign of his master's store. Many people did not believe this story to be true, but the fact that New Fengchun became famous in our</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>Town is a real fact; and it gradually spread to the surrounding villages. – This naturally also has a reason, because the land and water routes to the city all have to pass through our small town. Sometimes when people met Laughing Buddha going to the city to purchase goods, everyone asked him to bring them something. These things were naturally not available in his store. This inspired Laughing Buddha's cleverness, and he purchased all these things, but the price was the same as in the city. The prosperity of this kind of business can be predicted.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. After I finished four years of high school (old school system,) New Fengchun was a veritable general store. Everything from five-spice beans, coarse paper, dried bamboo shoots, red and black dates, matches, and all the items needed by rural people, his store did not miss a single item.</p>
<p>Later, I came to Shanghai to study at university, but because of my father's death, my family fell into decline. After dropping out of school, I struggled for food and clothing, and at the same time brought my mother to live with me in Shanghai, so my hometown became isolated and forgotten. At the end of last year, my uncle passed away, and when I returned to my hometown, it was a sunset dusk. Because of the hasty journey, I did not notice the Laughing Buddha with a pair of eyes that were always squinting into a line and a flat, wide mouth. The next day, when my aunt ordered the long-term workers to go to the city to purchase the items used in my uncle's funeral, she remembered him. When asked, the person who answered first shook his head and told me a sad story. In summary, his wife ran away with a man, and Laughing Buddha hanged himself!</p>
<p>Returning to Shanghai with double sorrow, I couldn't help but think of that joke: those who have not heard the story of Laughing Buddha are not people of our town, and the three characters New Fengchun seemed to have taken root and were floating in my mind.</p>
<p>That honest merchant who struggled all his life, now and his business have disappeared from the world!</p>

<h3 id="e232">Coconuts and Durians <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Man Su</p>
<p>Coconuts and durians are two special products of equatorial lands.</p>
<p>Vast groves are planted with orderly rows of coconut trees. Rows are separated by open spaces. On top of those tall trees, coconuts ripen every month. Chinese or Malay people pick them, and transport them to the market by cart or boat. In the open spaces in front and behind the shops, merchants and vendors agree on a price, and then count "one, two, three, four..." Then, workers break the hard shells, dig out the meat, dry it in the sun, and sell it to oil pressing factories. Coconut meat is pressed into oil, which can be used for lighting lamps, or for women to apply to their hair, or the coconut material can be used to make soap and other items.</p>
<p>A coconut grove is a unique tropical beauty, a comfortable place. Under the scorching sunlight, the coconut grove is exceptionally cool under the large shadows, the cool breeze is refreshing, blowing away the stifling heat. At night, the moon sifts its white light on the ground, the leaves sway with their shadows. The night is shrouded in a mysterious atmosphere, revealing a human paradise.</p>
<p>If one were to build a thatched cottage in the grove, like the owner of the grove, with the foundation of the house built of wood, and the walls built of wooden planks. Leaving windows facing all directions, allowing the cool breeze to blow through the entire house. In the evening, on the veranda by the railing, place a bottle of beer or a cup of coffee, lie down and gaze at the towering trees in the darkness, countless dark clusters; or on a moonlit night, gaze at the moon, dreaming a sweet dream. When the mood strikes, write a poem, read a story, it is truly endless joy, a human paradise.</p>
<p>Moreover, under the coconut trees is often where people in the equator play love games, a place that is not guarded against by any etiquette in the world. This is a naked world, a world of primitive people! Civilized people are useless here.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very appropriate to use coconuts to represent the spirit and way of life of equatorial people.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Durian fruit is covered with thorns and grows in wild forests. When ripe, it emits a huge stench, the smell resembling feces. But it tastes bitter and sweet, and the taste lingers in the mouth for a long time.</p>
<p>Chinese people who first arrive at the pass dare not eat it. But once they get used to eating it, they would "eat durian fruit even if they have to pawn their rags." Just like people who grow up in the plains.</p>
<p>Once durian fruit enters the market, the whole street is filled with the stench. At that time, the shells and kernels are everywhere, and people are eating durian fruit like crazy. Malays are like this, Chinese are like this, and even some Europeans are like this.</p>
<p>Eating durian fruit is quite difficult. Because the shell is hard and full of thorns, one should carefully use a knife to pry it open, and then use hands to dig out the meat from the slices of yellow, sticky flesh. The hands are covered with a pulpy substance, and the mouth exudes a foul odor. However, it is said that eating like this is the most enjoyable.</p>
<p>The way of eating durian fruit is the most common. The best way is: to squat down, regardless of rank or age, scrambling to dig out the meat to eat, surrounding the fruit. Until only the shell is left, then reluctantly leave as if something is lost.</p>
<p>Therefore, even judging from the way of eating durian fruit and the excitement and intoxication of the general public, it is enough to symbolize the spirit and way of life of the equatorial region!</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Using coconuts and durians as the symbols of the equator is truly the most appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Luo Yin Yong <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Xin</p>
<p>In the names of old places, there are often hidden myths or historical stories. And "Luo Yin Yong" is one of them. This is just a small place, but this small place has a thriving and lively time once a year, and this time is in the hot summer, when the divine women who worship the banners of the gods, and the poets and writers, must pass through it on their way to Dinghu Mountain. Therefore, from the mouths of most friends from Guangdong, you will always hear this poetic place name.</p>
<p>"Luo Yin Yong," how poetic it is. A place like a hermit's dwelling. Here are some farmers, planting dry fields. Although the land is not very good, according to the old custom in the South, they still harvest twice a year without fail. The people are so honest and so simple. Although every year the atmosphere of the city blows in, they never get infected even once. Although the men sometimes gamble, there has never been an accident; and the women are even more diligent, going to the fields to help during the farming season, and going to the mountains to cut grass and chop firewood for fuel when the fields are empty. This poetic place really has a hermit's flavor. When I come down from Dinghu Mountain, I always say goodbye here with a sense of sorrow.</p>
<p>This time, a friend and I went to Dinghu Mountain on a whim in late autumn. After coming down the mountain, we also went to this place as usual to have a snack and rest. There is a small teahouse that sells dim sum and tea, which is prepared for the guests' lunch. Naturally, after the lively season, this place is only coldly lonely. But I especially love this loneliness without the atmosphere of the city, so this time it seems particularly nostalgic. Perhaps it is because after this time, I will have to leave behind everything familiar from the past, and embark on an unfamiliar and lonely wandering journey that I long for. I gazed at everything familiar with my sentimental eyes.</p>
<p>"This small place has changed a bit," I said to my traveling companion. It really is a bit different.</p>
<p>"Naturally, when everything changes, this won't be an exception."</p>
<p>So, I paid more attention to every little thing here.</p>
<p>"The grain prices have fallen. This time, it's really terrible."</p>
<p>"When the harvest is bad, people blame the heavens; when the harvest is good, it's still the same. Who can you blame?"</p>
<p>"I really didn't expect that we would still have to go to the provincial capital!"</p>
<p>"......"</p>
<p>I heard these words from the mouths of two old farmers at the table opposite me. I glanced at them. Wrinkles covered their foreheads. Although their legs were still a bit strong, the reward for their hard work was telling them: they were already old. Such old people also have to go to the provincial capital. Are they going there to die? My heart was beating. Beating.</p>
<p>It was very quiet all around. Most of the shops were closed. Even those that were usually open on ordinary days, such as mountain goods stores, were also closed. After asking the waiter in the teahouse, I learned that because business was slow, they now only open during the bustling season, because the waiters have to find food elsewhere. Those who usually open their doors to do business now only do so during the bustling season. Speaking of the bustling season, it is also much deserted. In previous years, four or five dedicated ferries carried passengers, but this year there were not even half as many.</p>
<p>"It's getting worse every year."</p>
<p>In the final analysis, it's all the same sound. We also believe that no matter what place will be an "exception." When the time came, we left. As we boarded the ferry, we looked back at the lush countryside disappearing in the twilight.</p>

He asked if she bumped it too hard, and took the opportunity to grab her wrist, kiss the back of her hand, and then further kiss her palm to show his love. Jingyi then entered a period of love, often holding their cheeks together, like a child seeing a loving mother. The couple exerted efforts in art during their pink-colored future.

<p>Wu the leader was sent on official errands. He was accompanied by his colleagues from the money exchange on his round trip. Wu Er went home to bid farewell to his brother and sister-in-law. Wu Dalang instructed him with tears streaming down. Brother, today I will part with you, I don't know when you will return home. Wu Er spoke with both feet firmly planted, saying, heroes also shed tears. Calling out to his brother, he said, don't worry. He turned his angry eyes to look at the charming woman. Sister-in-law, your junior has something to tell you, don't look down on my brother. If there are any mishaps, I will make sure your life is hard to keep. Jinlian heard and replied, saying that Wu Song's words were unreasonable. Your sister-in-law is not a man who wears a scarf and turban, but a boisterous female leader. Who dares to bully my dear brother, tell me quickly what the reason is. Dalang came to persuade from the side, saying, brother, you and I have a great relationship with each other. Your foolish brother will offer you three cups of wine today, to protect your body and relieve my worries. With emotions of both nature and nurture, tears flowed down. The colleagues urged Wu the leader. He lifted himself to bid farewell to his brother and sister-in-law, turning his head several times as he was leaving. Reluctant to leave his brother behind.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Welcoming Spring"</p>
<p>The east wind has returned spring to the earth. All things are renewed and the atmosphere is restored. Go quickly to the eastern suburbs to welcome it. The flourishing ninety days have come again. Happily watching the plum trees in full bloom, auspicious symbols are tailored everywhere on the doors. Strike the spring ox. Brew new wine. Relatives and friends come for the New Year. Only feel that the scenery can make everyone happy, galloping and whipping, singing and dancing on the stage. Noble sons do not visit flower matters, planting thousands of red and purple brocades. The spring breeze points to the passing of time, the people happily return. The shadows of the trees sway, and the unlimited spring should be appreciated. The empty mountains and warm valleys have a harmonious atmosphere, only to see that the overlapping greens and layers of disease are not stained with dust. If one year meets the Spring Festival season, life will be difficult to extinguish. No need to trek to the ends of the earth, with heaven and earth as a garden and mountains and rivers to accompany. The world is gentle and full of fun, and there is nothing to do to unfold both eyebrows. Follow the curved waters and go to the mountain peaks, lingering in the middle stream for a few rounds. The water flows continuously along the stream, and the green mountains are folded back again. The scene of the three springs is unchanged every year, and the lively opportunity is taken by the plum blossom. Orioles leave the valley, and swallows linger. Several times the wind blows away the dust. The singing of birds and the fragrance of flowers are called beautiful things, how many times in life can one follow. Good times and beautiful shadows are difficult to describe, and the ladies praise them in unison. The flowers bloom slowly on the paths, and enjoy the leisurely return. Enjoy it as much as you can.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Male and Female Actors Whose Luck Began After Fifty (Part 1) <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>A hundred kinds of businesses have been hit by the economic downturn, and the theater world is certainly not immune. But you haven't heard the actors themselves groaning and complaining. If you walk through the area around Broadway's Palace Theater, you will feel a desolate and bleak atmosphere. You will also feel how dark it is inside many theaters. You can't help but worry about the general actors.</p>
<p>You may not be too concerned about young actors. The women can become models, and the men can sell soda. But what about those old actors? How do they weather this storm? Maybe they have savings in the bank. Or maybe they have property in the countryside. But listen to a story about Fields (W. C. Fields).</p>
<p>Fields turned fifty. He thought he could retire and return to his hometown. He was also determined to retire. He had 250,000 in the Halibut Bank, enough to live a leisurely life. But Halibut Bank went bankrupt in the midst of the recession. You read that news in the paper. Many people in Hollywood were hit hard. And Fields was one of them. His fortune was gone. He not only couldn't retire, but had to start all over again. This is the most tragic thing. How can a person live another fifty years to enjoy leisure? But what can you say when things get to the critical point? As a result, he buried himself in hard work again.</p>
<p>He made many efforts to seek work in various large companies, but the general producers did not lower themselves to welcome him. Later, he had to lower his standards and perform in Mark Sennett's slapstick shorts. A glimmer of light gradually emerged on the dark horizon, but misfortune did not come singly, and he encountered another unexpected event. Everyone took him to the hospital, where he was seriously injured. His neck was broken. The doctors clamped his head up and put his neck in a plaster cast. They took down the calendar on the wall, fearing that he would be anxious if he looked at it.</p>
<p>He lay down for several months, more often unable to sleep, and he couldn't remember what year or month it was. It may have been God's cunning, deliberately tormenting him with illness, but after the illness, his fate took a turn for the better. Before he had fully recovered, Paramount had already sent someone with a contract, waiting at the hospital door. It turned out that his humor in the slapstick shorts had, through his misfortune, promoted everyone's attention.</p>
<p>Now Fields tells people: "I used to think it was a mistake to retire at fifty. The bankruptcy of the bank was a punishment for my laziness. Later, when I was saddened by the loss of money, fate broke my neck again. I now solemnly inform fate that I am no longer saddened by the bankruptcy of the bank, nor do I regret breaking my neck. Please, god of fate, do not give me pain and punish me again."</p>
<p>May Robson is also a female star who became famous in her later years. She is now stealing the limelight from the general glamorous young girls. She once came to New York because New York had added a great-granddaughter, and someone asked her. She replied: "Tired? I don't feel it at all. I'm going back to shoot a new movie right away. I'm only driving in second gear now. That's what Marie Dressler liked to say. She often said that she wanted to die on the job. She did die on the job. No one can understand the pain she suffered, but she was not a person who deserted the battle. That kind of spirit is also my spirit. I am fortunate to have that spirit as well. I am very busy in Hollywood. One movie hasn't finished filming, and another movie has started. They are demanding older women. I just happen to be an older woman, isn't that my luck?"

<h3 id="e240">Review of "Nell Gwyn" <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Nell Gwyn - Greater Shanghai</p>
<p>"Nell Gwyn," starring Anna Neagle, is worth noting, at least in terms of the evaluation of film art. Under the excellent direction of Herbert Wilcox, her performance and the entire production technique have very good artistic achievements.</p>
<p>We have seen many films about palace history. Apart from the correct explanation of the producer's business plan, almost none of them have any other significance. Of course, some of them also depict the political secrets of a certain era, and even reflect the sufferings of the people. In this way, the audience has the opportunity to relive history and further explore science, which is by no means meaningless. Unfortunately, there are too few such films. What British and American producers are very interested in is still the romance in the palace. In the magnificent scenes and the glittering costumes, they use modern and sophisticated film techniques to confuse people in a paradise-like illusion, and then they smile triumphantly. In particular, this palace film, apart from seeing the romance between King Charles II of England and the actress Nell Gwyn, almost nothing more important historical events can be seen.</p>
<p>In this film, Charles II (played by Cedric Hardwicke) is written as a romantic emperor. He favors actresses, but he does not let actresses manipulate the government. He is an enlightened emperor, but also an affectionate man. Until his death, he still thinks of the actress, which gives people a deeply sympathetic impression. When we see the actress walking out of the palace alone in the early morning, we will not forget the desolate death of Charles II.</p>
<p>Here, we can clearly see that the playwright's technique of expression is indeed very well grasped. He simply grasps a few things to write, and explains all unnecessary processes with diaries or subtitles. He grasps the necessary points and writes them very fully. What we see is a very simple story, but it is concretely and figuratively expressed.</p>
<p>With a good script, it is of course much easier for the director. In addition to making the set very authentic and evoking a sense of nostalgia, he also pays special attention to the development of the play. Here we can put forward two points as examples for explanation. One is when the actress first enters the palace to see the king, she first reports the names of the dishes, etc., and very solemnly depicts the atmosphere of the court. At this time, the music is loud, setting off the haughty and arrogant demeanor of the Duchess (she is competing with the actress for favor) and the joyful laughter of the noble people. When the actress takes the stage, the music used for effect stops, causing the Duchess to suffer an embarrassing insult. The psychological description and even the air at the time are greatly enhanced with the help of sound. Secondly, what we want to put forward is the last scene, the air of death, the actress's crying, until the actress walks out of the palace alone, thanks to Monetgo's proper harmony and the domination of sound, the emotions at the time are indeed very well expressed.</p>
<p>As for the clarity of the personalities of the characters in the play, on the one hand, it is due to the excellent acting skills of the male and female protagonists, and on the other hand, we cannot deny the ingenuity of the director's technique. Apart from the insufficient content, this film is technically very beautiful.</p>

<p>— Xue Mei</p>
<p>Produced by Warner Brothers of America, starring Paul Muni and Bette Davis</p>
<p>The face beneath the old, worn hat was serious, yet young, with piercing eyes and thin lips, characteristic of their race. His shoes were covered in the dust of a long journey. A truck approached him and slowly stopped. The driver grumbled, "Come on, jump in." The man standing on the ground asked, "Thank you... where are you going?" The driver said, "Straight south, a long way." "Alright, I'm going south too." He said, climbing up and sitting next to the driver. The truck then sped off with hundreds of horsepower.</p>
<p>That was Johnny Ramirez, born in Sonora Town, in the Mexican quarter of Los Angeles, the day he left his hometown to conquer the world. Johnny Ramirez—determined to work hard in this new world of gold, to become a second Lincoln, and to buy a Persian lamb coat for his mother. Johnny Ramirez—diligently studied law for several years at night school, and his name was mentioned in his graduation speech. Johnny Ramirez—his mother pawned her wedding ring to make him a sign, which read: "Johnny Farraday Ramirez, Attorney at Law."</p>
<p>The Ramirez family lived above a grocery store, with the sign hanging above the door. Anyone walking past this dirty street in the Mexican quarter, with pots and jars displayed on the side of the road, with frivolous youths wearing brightly colored clothes and darting eyes, with Mexican farmers wearing overalls, and the sounds of music and Spanish accents—anyone walking there would definitely see Ramirez's law firm sign. That was the only hope of his mother and the local teacher, to win some respect for them. The sign hung there for some time, but then it disappeared.</p>
<p>To put it simply, this is what happened. According to principle, Johnny Ramirez's case in the Mexican quarter was foolproof. A girl, still dressed in her half-night attire with makeup on her face, beautifully dressed, came to this dirty area with a boyfriend to appreciate the exotic scenery of this ethnic enclave. His powerful car suddenly spun around in the middle of the road and happened to crash into an old farmer's vegetable truck, smashing it to pieces and scattering the vegetables all over the ground. That old truck was the livelihood of the farmer's family. How could he now transport his goods between the town and the countryside? He stood there dumbfounded, tears streaming down his face. He was holding a card in his hand. The girl's boyfriend even told her not to give him the card. Fortunately, the girl had some conscience and gave him the card.</p>
<p>The next day, everyone was in court. The girl looked calm and fashionable. Her boyfriend was also in court; he was a famous lawyer. The vegetable farmer looked defeated and humble. His only hope was Johnny Ramirez. Johnny was also in court. He was wearing a shiny blue serge suit and stood before the judge, his black hair disheveled. He gestured frequently with his arms as he spoke. Because of the anger in his heart, he could not help but sweat profusely.</p>
<p>But in the Plaza Chapel, Ramirez's mother knelt before the statue of the Virgin, praying: "Merciful Virgin, grant that my son may win this case, just this once. I have prayed repeatedly, just this once—or he will be heartbroken. Merciful Mary... help him... I don't want a fur coat... I only ask to win this case..." (To be continued)</p>
