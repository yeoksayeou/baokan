<p>時評</p>
<h3>經濟之自力生存</h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>中國如不求自給自足。無以圖中國之生存。但自給自足固為吾人心所嚮往。其難實難於登天。此非計劃經濟一時不易實現之為難也。卽實現矣。鷹視眈眈者能許中國從容不迫之處置。而不加以阻撓破壤乎。談經濟者為謀發展本國之農工實業起見。不曰增加生產。以自給而亦給人。稍塞洋貨之漏巵。卽日提高關稅。以衛民所以衛國。聊禦旣倒之狂瀾。此等理論在經濟學上固有深長之歷史。但在中國今日環境之下。事實究竟如何。殊不能不加相當之考慮。姑就目前情形言之。農事方面。則十元一担之蠶繭。置桑葉成本於不論。育蠶者計算其所得。恐尙不及上海女傭一月之工資。蠶豆小麥。收成巳有豐有歉。而其售價所得。一担難易三斗之米。返觀由大連運銷之黃豆。尙在貶價侵銷。遠涉重洋之米麥。猶是不絕而來。農產無論其收成豐歉。同是不値錢。而農民生活所需。幾乎什七為洋貨。則農村安得而不破產。都市安得而不崩潰。工業方面。說句傷心話。市上所見。幾乎皆為洋貨加工製造品。或我國境內洋商工廠之出產品。溯自關稅提高。許多商品。係由外洋輸入材料。就地配製。不察者以為此號稱「上海製造」者必為國貨。安知其為遮人耳目之外國貨也。至於重工業更談不到。有則非與外人合辦。卽為外人獨力所經營。輕工業偶有興辦。亦常遭外人之排擠。其能立足者實寥寥無幾。瞻望前途。我欲求自給。而人不許我自給。又將奈何。</p>
<p>至言關稅保護。在各國行之皆有效。而在我國。漏稅走私。時有所聞。甚至武裝包運。不顧淸議。在此種局面之下。欲求有效之辦法。更難乎其難矣。我之產品。尙有國內各種稅收。今與偷稅進口之貨同處市塲之內。其失敗可立待。但吾人不應以困難重重。而任人侵占我市塲。把持我利源。而不知自謀生存。蓋多難興邦。此正我民族能否渡此難關絕好試騐之時期也。</p>
<p>迺者英政府巳派遺羅斯氏為駐華大使經濟顧問。來華調查。以期復興我國經濟。尤注重於貨幣問題法亦派遣國際貨幣問題。專家雷諾西氏與之一同來華。而據十一日哈瓦斯社倫敦電所述。各國代表研究中國貨幣問題時。將維持其國內所用之銀本位。惟對國外所用者。商定一新辦法。大抵各就本國技術上立塲為根據。卽英國主張中國對外貨幣與英鎊發生聯繫。法國主張與黃金發生聯繫。美國則將要求與美元發生聯繫是也。此其所言。在各國未有表示之前。自難置信。但旣各有主張。利害衝突。恐亦難得善果。何况尙有其他阻礙在。要之。外人之為我中國謀。乃為自謀。亦人情之常。如英國在華有巨額之鐵路債權。而中國復為其孟却斯德之大主顧。自不能漠視其利益有被侵損之虞。但在我總當自求生存。無以依人籬下任人支配為得計。如幣制固無經久不變之理。但其變總當由自我之立塲着想。求其害少而便多。經久而可行。若為一時之計。不顧後來之害。以為今日需要而取用之。明日無需而放棄之。恐無如是之易易。卽使可能。而一般所受之凌亂損害。蓋已不堪言狀矣。興其如是。則何如向人申說放棄其購銀政策。吾人固明知其無效。但尙不致發生流弊也。</p>
<p>竊以為處此阽危局勢。欲求生存於萬一。祇有各盡其才力。統籌全局之大計。至學理上主張之異同。似尙無斤斤計較之必要。昔人議論未終而兵已渡河。可為吾人借鑑。卽如此次上海金融事件。何嘗不驚濤駭浪。危急異常。然以各方協力處置之結果。竟轉危為安。今者金融組織。已有不少之改變。潮收集中統一之成效。苟能善自運用而逐漸發展之。安知此次恐慌不轉成一較好之新局面耶。</p>
<p>總之。欲求中國經濟之改善。全在乎自力。人可為我謀者。我只可妥愼抉擇於其間。决不能作全槃之接受。惟如何方得自力生存。乃我所望於學者專家殫智竭慮以研究之者。</p>
<h3>中國臨存亡關頭　民族團結第一要圖　懷德爵士發表一文</h3>
<p>（倫敦）觀察報今日載前任中國政府政治顧問懷德爵士一文、謂中國刻在存亡危急之秋、獨自撐持危局、四十年前五列强互相妬忌、不欲任何一國過分膨脹其勢力、故中國得覓瓜分、但今日馳驟於遠東者僅有一國、中國唯有依賴其自己消極抵抗之能力與民族團結耳、有遠識之華人在此艱苦時期、當有所覺悟、而决計整理其內政、自已磨練充實國力、以圖復興云、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<h3>莫斯科報　暢論國際局勢</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）莫斯科日報社論謂、「自大戰結束、國聯成立以來、全世界必須在國際關係之各種方式中、在導向戰爭及保全和平之政策中擇一自處、從未有如此時之廣泛者、集體安全保證及列强之聯合行動以反對侵略國家、此為國聯之基本思想、此在國聯盟約第十六條之第一欵中業巳明示、</p>
<p>然而事實業已證明此項原則之實現、屢遇嚴重困難、因此國聯之理論及實施必須作一限制、由地方公約而實現之集體安全保障、成為國聯思想之繼續、此種思想之限制、已由生活自身給以說明矣、</p>
<p>確然、明瞭和平道路之限制萬分重要之國家、必不放棄其侵略計劃、在此導限制開始實現、或在彼導加速其侵略整備之時、此等國家亦卽開始脫離國聯、彼等之退出國聯、實含有企圖破壞集體安全保證制度之意義、</p>
<p>希特勒所倡戰爭地方化之理論、僅為分散世界思想之一宣言、與承認侵略無罪之思想同一意義、卽在此時、全出界可看出希特勒之理論究將導向何處、</p>
<p>中國卽首先成為此等國聯反對者及戰爭地方化思想信仰者之犧牲、日本因被認為無罪、故能再接再厲繼續侵略中國、得隴望蜀、公然力求完成其破壞中國獨立之野心、</p>
<p>我輩現正見一醜陋現象、列强雖亦目睹和平道路及其切身利益已受一再打擊、但因彼等不能聯合彼等之間無應付此等事件之行動方式之恊定、終至一事無成、</p>
<p>希特勒之戰爭地方化之思想、早被日本所採用、德國尙在倡導之中、但此亦僅國社黨之德國擴張軍備尙未完成、因而深感實力不足之際、方能暫不實行而已、</p>
<p>「歐洲各國如不及時聯合防範、終必有此一日、若捷克外長之訪問、其唯一目的卽為對此眞理作一新的證明、則其目的已達、吾等深信皮氏之訪問除信仰日德戰爭地方化之各國以外、必受全歐稱頌也、」（十六日塔斯電）</p>

<p>關東軍以南司令官為中心、此項軍隊遠離故鄉、旣無任何完善之設備、復未加以慰問、而其將校與士兵處於困苦情形之下、卻未稍露不平之言、且能盡力服務、實令人不勝感激、蘇「滿」間足惹起戰爭之重大動機、目下雖尙未發見、但容易造成衝突之動機、此為極須注意者也、關於維持治安、當由日滿兩國軍隊策其萬全、至剿滅「士匪」在短期間內似感困難滿洲地方未經開發之處尙多、故從事開發乃對於日本之人口問題與「滿洲國之產業開發上均有所必要、因此須根據國家上之大方針、應卽行使大最移民也、撤廢治外法權現已進行準備、須先由撤消課稅權為起點、决定開始、大致辦法至「康德」四年年底實行云、（十六日日聯社電）</p>

<h3>日人鐵蹄下　安東民不聊生　五十萬人難維生活　自殺犯罪層出不窮</h3>

<h3>太平洋安全感威脅　荷葡未雨綢繆　加緊建造海軍</h3>
<p>芝加哥訊據芝加哥星期講壇報載倫敦通信稱、當日本打破倫敦海軍談判、並宣稱彼於宣吿廢止華府條約後、將建造彼所認為彼在大平洋上安全所必要之海軍以來、美英兩國間為事勢所迫、對於太平洋事情之關係、密切更過於前、除英美之外、日本又迫荷蘭及葡萄牙亦加入太平洋風雲之畫圖、荷蘭兩國未被視為重要海軍國、已歷數代、今亦將於維持太平洋上白種權力之舞台上顯露頭角、荷蘭於日本侵略太平洋之始、卽憂慮該國太平洋殖民地之安全、又彼在歐洲方面、亦感覺倘德法兩國之一欲併吞其地、彼亦無力自衛、故其政策素主依託無利益關係之一國、或為與彼在太平洋及歐洲利益相同之一國、斯卽英國是也、</p>
<p>英國於華府條約未滿期以前、不克擴增其海軍、而葡萄牙非華府條約當事國、故可自由建造軍艦、現葡已在開始造艦、卽托英國船廠造之、且所造者為快速之輕巡洋艦此於遠東羣島問極為合用、斯殆為一種巧値歟、然此等新艦、將供太平洋上之用、已為不諱之事實、蓋葡亦為一重要之太平洋國家、彼具有至少與荷蘭相同之畏日本侵略之理由、因此彼現圖在澳門從事防禦工程、其計畫中包含可容葡海軍現所未有之大艦之船塢（世界社）</p>
<h3>英艾登與空相　演說安全和平　充實軍備防止戰爭</h3>
<p>（倫敦）不管部閣員艾登頃在華威克郡發表演說、謂「以吾人所得經騐而論、軍備競爭並非建設和平之道、但任何國凡感覺不安全者、自必重整軍備、無論何人均不能阻止之、以余所知、安全之道僅有一端、卽全體國家均明白表示願盡其力、以維持國際秩序、俾信用心得以產生而已、余個人對於集體扣平制度之觀念如是、爰乃主張英國務須以全力維護國聯會、則以國聯會係屬集體和平之唯一代表故也」云云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）航空大臣李斯脫爵士本日在中塞克期郡期丹摩地方發表演說、謂「以充分兵力防止戰爭、實乃最有效之方法、英國擴充空軍、係欲防止戰爭、初非驚惶失措所致、關於維護國家安全一層、政府責無旁貸、自當以全力赴之、且當進而為限制軍備訂立天空公約有所努力、藉以維護相互安全與一般和平、但欲達到此項目的、則非吾人置有充分之兵力與强有力之軍事組織不可」云云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>海軍問題　英德談話順利進行　德提造艦程序草案　意法覆文旦夕發出</h3>
<p>（巴黎）德國代表團今日續與英國海軍專家在海軍部開會時、提出德國造艦程序已草稿、據謂此項程序全視美國之方案為轉移、英國之方案經任何一般之妥恊結果、仍可加以修正、同時法國對於英德海軍談話之進行、顯為惶惶不寗、今日報紙言及英政府對於撕毀凡爾賽和約中之海軍條文毅然為之、不多作顧瞻、要知法國永不贊同德國請有等於英艦百分之三十五之噸位云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國報紙一致預料海軍會議、能有成功、據稱英國政府已允許德國三成半之要求、談話進行卽以此為基礎、晚報預料雙方可以同意、該報謂德國元首希特勒顯然已瞭解英國應有海軍優勢之必要、如其他大陸國家增加海軍力量、則英國自當繼起、而德國根據英德協定、亦能依照比率增加云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英德兩國海軍談話、將自明日起繼續舉行、大約將歷一星期始畢、關於英國所要求各級軍艦均適用百分二十五之比例一層、在原則上業經成立協定、但一般人相信在未明瞭法意兩國政府覆文以前、英國不願採取何種約束、法意兩國覆文、大約可於星期二日送到、其內容措辭係屬相同云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>德國造艦計畫內容</p>
<p>（倫敦）據傳聞英國行將要求法國遣派代表團前來此間、以便討論英德兩國關於海軍問題之協定、此項協定現尙未確定成立、但德國聞已允諾不建造三萬五千噸以上之主力艦、該國海軍造艦計畫中列有主力艦五艘、每艘噸位僅以二萬二千噸為限、其大砲口徑則為十一乃至十二英寸、該國又將倣照袖珍巡洋艦「德意志號型式、建造八千或一萬噸之重巡洋艦六艘、但此種軍艦噸位究屬若干、尙未擬定、此外並擬建造一千噸驅逐艦三十六艘、四百噸潛水艇十八艘、二萬二千噸航空母艦兩艘、此在英國則欲令其在相當年限內分別完成、以便該國能將陳舊軍艦從容替核云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英德海協法難接受</p>
<p>（巴黎）英德兩國在倫敦行將成立海軍協定、此間興論無不憤慨異常、各報均以為德國海軍噸位、等於英國海軍百分之三十五一層、在法國方面不能予以接受、小巴黎人報謂、意大利現擬先與法國接洽之後、始行對英提出復文、蓋該國所可循行之途徑、至少必與法國吻合無間也、社會黨機關報人民報亦持同樣見解云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>避免競爭於英有益</p>
<p>（倫敦）英德兩國海軍協定、大約卽可順利成立、綠德國因陸空兩軍重整軍備負担甚重、頃再建造海軍而以對英之百分三十五為比率、所需經費更覺不易籌措、自不致在此比率之外而另存奢望也、英國方面以為英德海軍協定在實際上頗有利益、（一）卽英德兩國不至重蹈一九一四年以前之覆轍、而從事海軍競爭、（二）卽德國承認英國在北海之海軍兵力、當優於德國、此外一般時局亦可於協定成立之後、趨於緩和、則以德國軍備業已完全恢復主權、自可參加集體安全制、而未來海軍會議亦有如期舉行之望故也、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>海空軍備未可相混</p>
<p>（倫敦）英德兩國海軍協定、允以英國噸位之百分之三十五畀予德國一層、法國方面曾提出異議、謂他日蘇聯若增加海軍兵力、德國或將藉口變更此項比率、又謂海陸空軍備互相國連之原則、迭經在軍縮會議提出、似可適用於海軍問題、而關於海軍問題、似亦可訂立天空羅卡諾公約相貊似之條約云、英國海軍界人士、頃批評此項異議、謂百分三十五之比率、係屬確定數字、决無變更之餘地、至海陸空軍備互相關連之原則、實未可適用於海軍、則以華盛頓海軍條約與關於訂立天空羅卡諾公約、現正進行之談判、截然為兩事、未可混為一談也、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>德火藥廠　爆炸原因推測　由於試驗毒瓦斯不愼所致</h3>

<h3>東菲一日開戰　封鎖蘇彝士河　英國輿論有此傾向　意報援引公約答辯</h3>
<p>近來外間有一種謠傳、略謂某一國家為防東菲發生戰事、有將蘇彝士運河隨時封鎖之意思、此種謠傳不値一辯、蓋以蘇彝土運河之為國際公用、原有一八八八年十月二十九日之君士坦丁公約為保障、意大利於此約亦曾簽字、該約第一條云、蘇彝士運河無論平時戰時、對於任何國家之商船或軍艦皆得自由通過、故此河於國際法上决無封鎖之理由、此種規定决非任何國家所得單獨變更、設有此種威脅發生、按照該約第八條、亦應將此問題付諸各簽約國共同討論云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>英埃談話　質詢三項問題</p>
<p>米蘭據此間報載、埃及行政院長楠辛與英國駐埃最高委員藍浦森談話、認意阿戰事發生埃及利益必蒙損害、以是楠辛向藍氏提出如下之問題、卽意阿戰事若爆發、英國將採何種方法以砠之、英國能否阻止意國飛機之越過埃境、能否封鎖蘇彝士運河以阻止意國軍艦之出入、英國能否援助埃及及獲取尼羅河水源之阿國查那湖地域云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>英報主張　援用國聯盟約</p>
<p>關於意國與阿比西尼亞爭端、英國一部分報紙提出主張以為意阿兩國一旦發生戰釁、則英國卽當援引國聯會盟約第二十條之規定、將蘇彝士運河加以封鎖、以為制裁意國之計、（按國聯會盟約第二十條第二項云、如有聯合會會員於未經入會以前所負義務與盟約條欵觸抵者、應卽設法解除此項義務）意大利日報頃討論此一問題、並予以答辯、謂「蘇彝士運河推而至於各海峽各航海要道、苟可作為國聯會制裁會員國之工具、一如國際空軍之當用為制裁工具也者、則現行海峽制卽有切實修改之必要、而代以新制度、賦以國際性質、幷將若干國現所享受之特權予以慶止矣云云、（按土耳其要求在達達納斯博福魯爾兩海峽重整軍備、英國最所反對、意報此語殆係指此而言）、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對意阿爭端　英政府之態度　國聯會不可恃滿洲事件可為殷鑒　不欲投鼠忌器使意投入德國懷抱　郝爾外交具軟性仍擬以調人自居</h3>
<p>英國對於阿比西尼亞問題之態度、當就兩方面加以研究、一方面係國聯會之關係、另一方面係阿比西尼亞及英國本身利益之關係、就國聯會之關係論之、英國始終認為阿比西尼亞旣屬國聯會會員國、則應與其他會員國享受國聯會之一切權利、而於領十遭受侵略時、由其他會員國予以援助、自亦為其應享權利之一、因此當五月二十日阿國皇帝向國聯會申請以和平方法解决華爾華爾事件、並劃定意阿疆界後、英國卽以全力設法避免戰事、並竭力促成仲裁委員會之組織、以解决意阿之爭端、果也、意大利因英國代表艾登態度堅决之故、卒於五月二十五日接受國聯會行政院之决議案、事後艾登返國、各報皆備加稱道、謂國聯會解决意阿爭端得獲勝利、實出艾登之力、於是艾登穏任外相之希望、亦益見增加、不意六月九日內閣改組、外相一席竟以畀諸印度事務大臣郝爾、此則艾登年眞過輕、固為其原因之一、而在政界人士觀察、則謂艾登在意阿爭端中態度過於强硬、實亦為其不能繼任外相之一主要原因、最近意國屬地與阿比西尼亞邊境又復發生事故、乃復振振有辭、謂必須採取新措置、以免釀成新局勢、意相墨索里尼並發表演說、謂「意國對於意阿爭端、有自行設法解决之必要而决不有所顧慮」云、可見意國態度已十分明白、歐一洲各國政府深知若仍以國聯會為屏障、一阻止意國對阿比西尼亞之行動、則意國一必以退出國聯相報復、嗣後意國各報羣一以激烈論調抨擊英國、意國政府且微露與柏林接近之意、在此種情勢之下、英國政府深知如一旦引用國聯會盟約第十五十六條提出制裁兩字以對付意國、則國聯會不啻遇第二滿洲事件、且效尤日本者又為一歐洲國家、故其事態嚴重、必較滿洲事件為尤甚、結果所至、意德兩國或將互相妥洽、分割奧國、致使歐洲外交局勢完全轉變、而與國聯會相對立之集團因以成立、共危險未有甚於此者也、英國政界人士因此觀察、新任外相郝爾爵士之政策必更具軟性、最近意國報紙忽停止攻擊英國、當與郝爾爵士之軟性外交有關、此外更有一事頗足注意、近日傳間簽訂一九〇六年阿比西尼亞條約之英法意三國將共同行動、以阿國重要經濟權利讓於意國、並在阿國領土內建築鐵道以興意屬紫謀里蘭連貫、作為意國停止軍事行動之交換條件、此種試探性質之提議、係由倫敦方面發出、意國政府雖加否認、但並未絕對予以拒絕、由此可見英法意、三國、不久將向阿國秘密交涉、俾使意國獲得滿意、固非不可能也、再就英國本身利益加以觀察、英國根據一九〇六年以前各項條約、在英埃蘇丹內地獲有重大利益、决無放棄之理、嗣後英法意三國訂結一九〇六年阿比西尼亞條約、又將阿比西尼亞劃分勢力範圍、相互承認、法國雖放棄此項權利、但英意兩國則不然、英國主要利益、乃在著名之查那湖、該湖水面提高之後、可用以灌溉英埃蘇丹之大部分農地、藉以栽種棉花、供英國工業之露、目前查那湖四週築堤下程、已在進行中、蘇丹、埃及、阿比西尼亞所組織之委負曾、現正磋商藍尼羅河水利分配之細則、倫敦方面因此項水利工程、係根據巳往所訂結之契約、與意阿爭端絕無關係、且於意國利益、亦並無損害、故對於意國報紙攻擊此事、甚以為異、大抵今後數月中、英國將繼續以調人自任、使意阿爭端歸於消滅、並繼續勸告意國勿從事戰爭、然戰事如不幸而爆發、則英國當亦不致有所行動、蓋英國不欲投鼠忌器、以使意國投入德國懷抱也、如英國對於意阿戰爭擬有所行動、則惟有封鎖蘇彝士運河之一法、蘇彝士運河曾於一八八八年由各國訂結條約、無論在平時或戰時、均應准許各國船舶自由通行、然英國自由黨議員憂德則於六月七日在下院發表宣言、主張援引國聯會盟約第二十條（該條規定會員國未加入國聯會以前所負國際義務、與盟約條文相抵觸者、應設法解除此項義務）、以廢除戰時蘇彝土運河自由通航之制度、曼德此項主張、或為對付意國之一種方法、無如在實際上、則殊難於施行耳、（十五日哈瓦期電）</p>

<p>市黨部告　同志同胞</p>
<p>本市市黨部執監兩會、為廖仲愷先生靈櫬過滬、特發吿同志同胞書一種、原文如下、「親愛的同志同胞、中央特派專員赴粵、迎葬廖仲愷先生靈柩於總理陵墓之旁、茲値過滬停柩之日、除虔誠祭奠外、愛將先生革命史實及其偉大精神、略述如后、以吿同志同胞、廖先生名恩煦、字仲愷、廣東惠陽縣人、父商於美、先生誕生於民國紀元前三十四年三月十日、年十七歲、方歸國、二十二歲、娶夫人何香凝女士、伉儷甚篤、旋赴日本留學專攻經濟及財政、造詣甚深、日俄戰起、中國危殆、總理至東京、集十七省革命同志、組織中國同盟會、先生夫婦均加盟、後於辛亥革命、討袁護法、出師北伐、無役不從、尤以掌理財政、對於革命軍需、有極大之帮助、平時對於提倡農工運動、改善農工生活、尤所努力、黃埔軍宮學校之成立、先生擘劃之力亦多、總理逝世後、先生贊襄蔣中正同志討平楊劉之亂、又恊力組織國民政府、統一軍民財政、以鞏固革命基礎先生愛黨若命、嫉惡如仇、因之反革命者羣謀不利於先生、十四年八月二十日先生遂為反革命者所狙擊而逝世、時年僅四十有九、此不但本黨之一重大損失、抑亦整個國家民族之一重大損失也、先生人格高尙、功業彪炳、學問淵博、固為世人所稔悉、須知先生造詣之所以如此偉大、實本於其革命人格之修養、吾人今日迎葬先生、敢舉數事以為模範、（一）毅力、先生追隨總理、致力革命、凡二十餘年、其間經過多少艱難困苦、顚沛流離、初不稍餒其革命之志、因有此種堅忍之毅力故能於艱困之環境中、奮鬭犧牲、鞠躬盡瘁成就其革命史上之偉續、（二）忠貞、先生為總理之忠實信徒、一生與總理共患難、同甘苦、絕對服從總理命令與黨的紀律、只知肩負義務、不知計較權利、舉其聰明才力全獻於黨、此稱忠貞之革命赤忱、尤為今日同志同胞所當效法、（三）勤廉、先生每日工作、普通常在十一二小時以上、有時甚至十六七小時之久、其動勞國事可知、先生自奉儉約、雖迭掌財政、但兩袖淸風、家無餘財此種廉潔操守、實可愧死貪官汚吏、（四）為學、先生幼年固發奮向學、卽壯年奔走革命、亦不忘求知、終身好學不倦、故其革命之意志與精神、常緊張奮發、而其學問亦與時俱增、此種革命不忘求學之精神、最足為革命者所矜式、吾人今日迎葬廖先生、適逢內憂外患國難嚴重之日尤應以先生之人格為模範、以促進本黨革命事業之完成、完成先生未竟之遺志、一·廖仲愷先生不死、二·廖仲愷先生是總理的忠實信徒、三·廖仲愷先生是農工同胞的救星、四·廖仲愷先生的偉大人格、是全國同志同胞的模範、五·效法廖先生的革命精神、六·迎葬廖先生要剿滅赤匪解除農工痛苦、七·迎葬廖先生要精誠團結挽救國難、八·迎葬廖先生要發展生產充實國力、九·三民主義萬歲、十·中國國民黨萬歲、十一·中華民國萬歲、中國國民黨上海特別市執監委員會」</p>
<h3>汪院長等來滬</h3>
<p>行政院長汪兆銘·外次唐有壬·鐵次曾仲鳴。昨乘夜快車出京、今晨抵滬、</p>
<h3>外部南洋領館視察員　陳春圃鄭麐昨返國　對於領館僑胞商務發表觀感</h3>
<p>外交部為視察南洋各地領事館·及欲明瞭各地商務僑務實况起見、於今春二月、特派該部顧問梁字臯氏、僑務委員會常務委員兼僑民敎育處處長陳春圃氏、及前鐵道部參事鄭廜氏、前往視察除梁氏因另有要公、出發稍遲、現尙在途中外、陳鄭二氏、則於三月初出發、先後歷經安南·馬來半島·暹羅·荷屬南印度·及菲律賓·等處為時計三月有餘、近以任務完畢、乃由菲乘加拿大皇后號歸國、昨日下午一時半抵埠、外交部駐滬辦事處主任余銘·及上海僑務局吳公虎·等趨埠歡迎、與陳鄭兩氏同行者、尙有隨從秘書蘇鴻賓羅海光三氏、陳鄭兩氏當發表南行觀感書面談話如下、</p>
<p>此行任務</p>
<p>據云、余導之任務、大致可分為三項、（一）視察領事館、（二）考察商務、（三）考察僑務十余等於三月九日、由滬乘「阿島斯第二號」出發、先後歷經西貢。新嘉坡·吉隆坡·怡保·檳榔嶼·暹羅·盤谷·棉蘭·巴達維亞·萬隆·井里汶·直葛·三寳壟·馬吉朗·日惹·梭羅·泗水瑪琅·南海漳·加厘巴魯·外南夢·峇厘·望加錫·馬尼刺等處、</p>
<p>領館行政</p>
<p>各地領館、在辦事方面、大多數尙屨認眞、惟關於制度方面、似有改進之必要、綠領事本為商務官、其責任在通商保僑、年來各地領館、對於當地之商務、雖有種種之調查與統計、然欲求得適合實際需要、以促進相互間之貿易者尙少、故以為對於領館之組織及行政效率、非有統盤籌劃以謀改善不可、茲事體大、自非於制度方面有詳密之規定、人事經齊有所改進不為功、</p>
<p>各地商務</p>
<p>至於各地商情、安南被為衰落、空店隨處皆是、此一方面係受不景氣之影響、他方面因中法越南商約尙未成立、在雙方貿易上均受影響、如中法越南商約訂立後、我國將在西貢·海防·成河內、設立領事館、以資通商保僑、將來情形、或可轉佳、馬來亞各地、較有復興氣象、近來榭膠及錫略見起色、故商情較他處為佳、荷屬各地、因抽稅太重、進出口均感困難、而匯水甚高對外貿易亦受打擊、兼之士人之知讓漸開、我仲介商人之地位、漸見動搖、菲島僑商、多零售商及木商、經營尙可、惟因近年菲島力求獨立、有國民經濟維持會之組織、對我僑商營業、不無打擊、我僑商之被排擠近巳迭有發現矣、</p>
<p>僑胞狀況</p>
<p>至於各地僑胞、對祖國甚為關懷、殷股垂詢國內之政治建設等甚詳、而於提倡國貨、其熟誠亦不遜於國內第人士、因受別國貨物傾銷之影響、國貨銷路、殊難得到地位、但如能在運輸配貨及經濟方面有相當之組織、則前途尙可樂觀、至於各地商會、組織較為完善者、如新嘉坡·暹羅·棉蘭·巴達維亞·之商會、確能為僑胞謀得福利不少、黨務方面、在英屬各地、以換文關係、殊受限制、故對於黨務之推進、頗少明顯之成績、荷屬各地黨部雖得公開、但工作活動、亦感困難、故年內海外同志、有心勞日拙之感</p>
<p>僑胞敎育</p>
<p>在華僑敎育方面、余等除參觀學校外、並約當地敎育界談話、探詢當地敎育情况及意見、茲將各地情况、略述一二、安南方面、敎育尙不發達、各校之課程及敎學尙有待於改良、多數學校猶以各地方言敎授應早改用國語、馬來亞之僑敎、辦理尙屬不差、惟有少數學校、因欲受當地政府之津貼、自幼稚園起、卽敎英文、此點實不合於國民基礎敎育、暹羅之僑敎、以當地政府施行强迫敎育、我僑校幾難於辦理、荷屬僑教、因受不景氣之影響、經費多感困難、惟辦學者尙能想盡種種方法、以支持過去、殊堪嘉慰、現因向本國政府立案問題、引起荷印政府之取締、吾人實引以為憾、查吾僑辦學之宗旨、純為培養靑年、並無政治作用、依照各國通例、呈請本國政府立案、亦純為學生回國升學便於稽查學歷起見、毫無其他用意、當地政府、實無庸過慮、一現此案正在交涉中、余等深信、倘荷印政府能明瞭此點、當可收回成命也、菲島之僑敎、辦理較為自由、但成績較遜、查菲島華校、上半日授中文、下半日授英文、在酷熱的天氣、兒童要整天上課、還要讀兩種文字、未免太辛苦、在能力上也恐怕不够、同時在課程方面、似屬重複、譬如算術一課、有中英文之別、此點似應加以研究、我等感覺各地僑胞、對辦學甚為執心、倘能在課程上、敎學上設備上、加以改進、則不難臻於完善、</p>
<p>日內返京</p>
<p>總之、領事館為保僑通商之機關、其地位甚為重要、在行政方面、自應設法提高效率、同時應提高其地位、俾便領導僑衆、而在僑胞之本身方面、應速謀團結、集中力量、打跛從前各自為謀之習慣、則或可挽救目前之危機於萬一、其他方面、尙多觀感、惟以時間關係、不能一一奉吿云云、氏等抵滬後、分寓於新亞酒店·東方飯店·定今明日內返京、將視察經過、報吿外交部復命、</p>

<h3>僑務委員長陳樹人談　政府救濟華僑</h3>
<p>中央僑務委員會委員長陳樹人奉政府命於十五日下午二時半、由京搭早車來滬、與本市市長吳鐵城等協商迎先烈廖仲愷氏遺櫬入京、華東社記者特於昨晨赴新亞酒樓四五四號寓次往訪、承談政府救濟華僑問題等甚詳、</p>
<p>華僑地位</p>
<p>陳氏首語華東社記者謂、年來因世界各國、日趨不景氣關係我旅外華僑、自不免稍較困難各國當局、為其國民生計計、有少數工作、不免與華僑衝突、而生排逐之舉、惟我國僑胞、不論旅居何處、均有一種特性、卽（一）勤儉、（二）溫恭、（三）性情和平、作事耐勞、且因勤謹故、致生產能力、較之各國國民為專長、同時工資又較各該地國民為低廉、故年來地位已漸鞏固、雖因種種關係而有排華舉動、但事情之出於感情衝動者居多、始終因各國需要華僑帮助建設之處頗多、故事後卽又十分歡迎華僑、</p>
<p>墨事爲證</p>
<p>陳氏隨卽引證二年前墨西哥排華事件作證明當時墨國政府、因受工黨議員之攻擊，而引起激烈之排華運動、惟事後該國需要華僑帮助建設、工黨議員排華之聲、亦卽消聲匿跡、因該國國民之生產消費、遠不及華僑也、現今各地雖有排華之舉、想經各方抗議政府交涉結果、决可於最短期內謀得解决途徑、</p>
<p>救濟僑胞</p>
<p>政府救濟華僑事、已在外交內政上雙方並進、若各國有排華情事、在外交上、政府願作民衆後盾、據理力爭、一方面自身亦努力建設、如安徽宣城僑樂村之建設、巳於昨日開幕、政府各機關均曾派代表前往參加、足證政府對於僑胞之重視、此舉乃備萬一華僑出於不得已而回國、政府自當為之容納、代覓安身之處、則僑胞進可以取、退可以守矣、値此國難嚴重之秋、政府對千萬僑胞、正在籌謀救濟辦法也、云云、陳氏以在滬迎廖先生遺櫬事、耽擱二三日、卽將於十八日返京、</p>
<h3>救濟工商貸款　今日三次會議　委員會保證貸欵　銀錢業直接貸放</h3>

<p>蔡氏講辭</p>
<p>蔡承新講詞云、承駱淸華先生吩咐兄弟在第三次承兌匯票演講中、講述些國外的情形、近來因為工作較忙、不暇作系統的預備、就拉雜談談吧、匯票的歷史很悠久、大槪在三百年前、意大利威尼斯和佛羅倫斯等地的商人、因實際的需要、巳有滙票的施用、在英國一八八二年時所制定的票據法上、對於商業承兌匯票、就有很確切的解釋、至於美國加拿大等地方、承兌滙票的發展、比較落後、約在一百十年之前、才有這種方法、但並不十分看重、自一九二九世界經濟恐慌發生後、市面籌碼驟形緊縮、於是極力提倡商業承兌滙票、數字方面、據約略的佔計、去年全年的承兌匯栗、大概價値七八十萬萬元、坎拿大方面、約有十幾萬萬元、英國因為統計的方法不完備、準確的數字比較難得、以上是承兌滙票在海外流行的大略情形、我國目前的經濟狀况、也正需要推行這種方法、所以這次駱消華先生等積極提倡、决不是一種盲目的嘗試、乃是接受別人家的可貴的經騐、因好在現狀之下、市面籌碼旣這樣缺乏、銀錢業對於放賬、自不能不十分收縮、然而我人又不忍也不甘長此將市面停頓下去、所以惟有想補救的方法、使銀根轉鬆、市面透呈活氣、以渡過這不景氣的難關、現在我們發覺商業承兌匯票是最促迎合目前的需要的、所以大家有竭力提倡的義務、至於承兌滙票的種種優點、和施行的方法、大槪以前幾位先生已講得很詳細、兄弟不再贅述了、</p>

<h3>本市昨得甘霖　氣候轉凉人心趨安　勞苦農民喜形於色</h3>
<p>本市自入夏以來、匝月亢旱、一般人多恐慌旱魃之重來、乃昨午天氣急變、時雨霈降、至晚始停、田禾稍蘇、農民莫不喜形於色、而雨後米價、亦卽回縮、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>時雨霈降</p>
<p>自入夏以來、久旱不雨、炎熱亢燥、幾將發生大旱現象、昨日上午、氣候酷熱、度數達華氏寒暑表約九十度左右、兼之天空昏雲迷漫、更覺皆悶異常、及至下午十二時三刻、忽然細雨濛濛、隨風飄灑、繼而雨點漸大、未幾檐前滴水、直至下午五時三刻稍停、惟穹窿浮雲、依舊密佈、仍又作雨之態、昨日自午至晚雨量約三四寸因之炎威漸退、似在秋凉天氣、</p>
<p>田禾稍蘇</p>
<p>本市各區棉田禾田、自亢旱迄今、阡陌之間、巳呈乾涸現象、農民日夜　水灌溉恐旱魃之再降、無不私心惄憂、經昨日時雨驟然霈降後、雖雨量未能實現理想之渴望、但經此調劑、對久旱之田、當不無小補、不論棉禾及其他雜糧、恃此天然灌溉稍形回蘇、故農民轉憂為喜、據老農言、昨日氣候陰霾、不獨浙滬一帶降雨預料江南諸省、均似有雨意、</p>
<p>雨後米價</p>
<p>滬市米價因氣候亢旱、輸運較為困難、故來源减少、自上週以來、連績高漲、北市頭號（卽特號）米巳超過市府規定之限價、其餘陳秈洋米等均漲半元以上、昨日為星期例假、市場祗上午交易、至十二時收市止、米價仍與前日相同、惟據豆米業公會委員羗桂生語大公社記者、今日（卽昨日）上午市情趨穩、並無漲跌、迨下午忽時雨霈降後、氣候轉凉、旱象稍殺、一般人心漸趨安定、故預料明晨（即今晨）開槃時米價當能回縮、如再有多量之雨水調劑、則秋收當不致受有損害也、</p>

<p>— 黃克威</p>
<p>叮噹……叮叮噹……</p>
<p>赤著膊，粗壯的　膊上凸起挺硬的栗子肉。握緊著沉重的鐵錘，一下一下地打著那紅的鐵，火花像金星般飛舞開來，生命力的閃耀呵！</p>
<p>他們是鐵匠，年青，勇敢，一天到晚挺起了胸脯兒做、把力汗雲換白飯吃！雖然血汗浸透了身，火燄灼焦了皮膚，但他們沒有太息，沒有悲哀！</p>
<p>他們是生長在鐵和火的世界裏，煤和煙的氣息裏，整個身子黝黑地，眼珠子佈滿了紅脛胳，毛刺刺的祼腿上裹著麻布服袋，抵抗著火星的侵襲；靠近他們的身邊，一雙偉大的溶鐵爐燃燒著，猙獰地張大著血紅的嘴巴。貪婪不厭的吞吃一大塊，一大塊的煤炭，長鼻子裏噴出熱的氣，彌滿了整間低矮的屋子。</p>
<p>從早晨到黃昏，黑夜而黎明，他們不停地，不停地打著鐵；叮叮噹，叮叮噹，永遠交響著那麼單純的，宏亮的調子！</p>
<h3>姨太太與耕牛</h3>
<p>— 張皇</p>
<p>在常人的常識中，正室的妻子是治家的內助，姨太太乃是男子的洩欲器，是富人的玩具，娛樂品，裝飾物，同時伊們本身是寄生蟲。享樂者而已！熟知有大謬不然者，有所謂鐵一般的事實為證！</p>
<p>我的故鄉有一個鄉下人朱某，原以跑租（即受誠傭於田主，代為下鄉跑腿收取租米者）為業；鎮上有幾家置有西鄉的田，都委托他順路併收的。他取得雇主應有的酬費，又得以少報多的在逐個東家處收償食宿盤川的墊賬，還可分得一點中費當東家有田地買賣進出時，歷年下來，他漸由一個　人子積成小康之家。</p>
<p>他在每年農家大熟之後，動身往西鄉一帶跑租了。這是田主們代表的身份，威權，自重，得租戶們畏敬相加。他逢到食宿的時候，自然責成租戶家供張，無須破鈔的。後來一連幾年中，他竟由農家選宮女也似的弄到了五六個一律年輕力壯的大姑娘，順手牽羊般的帶回他家裏去，作為他的小老婆，即姨太太了。</p>
<p>這朱某在本鄉已薄有田畝，帶了這許多小老婆來家，便逐個分派伊們擔任農事的工作，　泥，插秧，車水，芟草，以至收　登場上隴，分工合作，居然能指揮如意，增加了很銳的產量。他往往在人前誇張他的妙算道：『我畜養著這些女人，譬如著了幾條耕牛，卻不需化費買牛的錢。伊們既可做耕牛同等能力的事，比耕牛更多靈性，肯聽話。就使把伊們比作田道裏的雇工，眼見可省下這多人的工錢，還得各個人赤心護家。至於閨房之樂，和火如荼，猶其餘事也！』</p>
<p>可惜，這值最工心計的朱某，漸漸得了萎症，現在已不能下牀；眼看這粥粥群雌你我互相擠排，天天鬧得雞鳴犬吠之聲相聞，一任田事荒怠，久不敷出，無法收拾！結果，他自己做了耕牛的耕牛，終於力不勝任了！</p>

<p>但是有了北海在這裏走著，便引起了志前的興趣料著是有些動作在後面，依然是手扶了門，向外偷覷。果然，不多大一會兒工夫，北海踅轉身，又到了這門口來了。只見他背了兩手，斜伸了一只腳站住，眼睛可是向胡嫂子家裏看了去。約莫有五分鐘，他不曾將腳移動。隨後他就昂了頭看看天上的晚霞，又回頭向兩邊張望著，看看巷子裏的人家大門，移著腳向西走了一二十步。走去的時候，腳步是移得非常的緩。及至扭轉身來，卻又很快的回到原處。到了原處，他沒有別的，依然是抬頭看看，回轉頭向巷子兩頭張望。而向對門胡嫂子家裏，卻不怎樣的注意，不過是偶然看上一眼而已。就是這個時候，朱月英在那對面院子裏一閃，立刻進到房屋裏面去，然而也不過一分鐘的工夫，他又出來了。看他的樣子，好像心裏有些很　　，手扶了牆壁，低了頭走。及互到了他大門口，先把一個指頭，啣在嘴裏頭，那時。眼光自然是向下面看著的。對面站著有個年輕的書生，他好像是不曾看到。北海呢也正是和他一樣的態度非常的自在，並不理會到對面有位姑娘出來。月英到了門口，啣在嘴裏的指頭，總算抽出來了。卻兩手扶在門框，向天上看看，自言自語的道：誰說天上有下雨的樣子，天氣好得很呢。（二四一）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>其時又輪到李連英來嗣　了，他先取出一個特製的號角來，放在嘴上吹了三四聲；這樣那兩艘　著爐灶，已給太后端整好酒菜的小船，便如飛價的劃近　來一只五左，一只在右的並靠在御舟的兩旁；於是御舟上的人就搬出兩條特備的跳板來。擱在大船和小船的中間，那些太監們便紛紛打　跳板上往來奔走，準備開始端出太后的午餐來。</p>
<p>今天想是因為在船上怕容易滾動打碎或沉下去湖去的緣故，一切盛菜的器皿全是改用了金質或銀質的東西，只除太后所用的筷子，還是那一只天天供伊使用的玉筷，沒有更換；而那些端菜的太監們，則因船上地位狹窄。不便奔走，只得仿照了上次在火車上所用過的方法，排成很整理的兩行。分著左右，一直從跳板上排列兩邊的兩只小船上，所有的菜，便依次逐一傳遞上來。不過這些太監的手上都已臨時覆著一方乾淨的白布，以免他們的手指，直接和太後的食物相接觸。菜的樣數卻照例還是一百樣。並未減少半點；但因船上的桌子畢竟較小了許多，同時實在擺不下，只得將幾碟冷盆和甜菜之類，先放到桌子上去，餘下的暫時讓那些太監捧著，好在每個碗碟上面都配著蓋頭，盡可使裏面的菜保住著原有的溫度。太后一面咀嚼那幾品先端上去的菜肴，一面和我說話，我也竭力的和伊敷衍，希望能夠把伊的歡樂始終的留住著。（三四一）</p>

<h3>談談龍華寺的藏經</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>昨天上海各日報，都載著一條龍寺整理明代萬曆朝欽賜大藏經的消息，因為龍華寺是在上海，處於研究上海地位的我們，見到那一條「野人頭」式的新聞，似乎不能再緘默。</p>
<p>翻一翻清肛康熙，乾隆，嘉慶，同治各朝的縣志，關於龍華寺在明萬曆年間頒給過一部藏經，都有同樣的記載，大略說：當時皇帝下詔頒佛藏於諸名山，龍華寺的住持達果和尚就疏請頒給，得皇帝的允許，特遣中涓　勅詣寺，頒藏經七百十八函，並且　賜了達果和尚金環紫衣護藏。但是再翻一翻上海縣續志，它又說在清同治十三年（一八七四年）也曾請過一部藏經，由所謂龍華寺的中興祖師觀竺和尚向部裏領到的。在子韜的　壖雜記裏，也曾說：「……甲戌夏間，寺中住持觀竺，由部領到藏經，備儀仗迎之人，護從僧約白餘人，兵　之後，象教日昌，此其徵也。」由此我們可以知道龍華寺先後一起有兩部藏經。那麼事實就得轉到題目上面來，龍華寺在整理的藏經，究竟是明萬曆年間頒給的？還是清同治年間頒給的？據住持性空和尚的斷定，以為是明代頒給的無疑了，而那位由性空和尚請來的曾經在重慶華嚴整理藏經的　陀法師也並不否認；新聞是那樣的登載，讀者也就那樣的相信著。但是據我們上海通社考證的結果，龍華寺現存的藏經絕對不是明萬曆版，而是清同治朝頒給的「龍藏版」。現在可以將考證的結果寫一點：</p>
<p>據那位曼陀法師初步整理藏經的結果，說大藏經全部每十三卷為一函，除經目不計外，共有七百三十函，檢點之下，計完擊無缺者三百五十九函，殘缺不全者三百十九函，完全散失者五十三函。照函數來講，如果是明萬曆版，那末照縣志的記載應該是七百十八函，現在卻除經目以外有七百三十函，可知決不是明萬曆版而是龍藏版，因為龍藏版的總數是七百三十五函，這是一。</p>
<p>再拿版式來講。明萬曆版的藏經，是在神宗萬曆一七年（一五八九年）由密藏幻余二禪師發起刻的，當時敢山紫柏諸大師，以及袁了凡馮夢禎等竭力贊助，就在徑山楞嚴寺彫版，隔了數十年才刻完。當時的式樣是方冊式的。至於龍藏版是清世宗雍正十三年（一七三五年）到高宗乾隆三年（一七三八年）刻成的，以「北藏版」做底稿。形式梵　式的，每頁五行，和蜀版形式相同。龍華寺現在的藏經，上海通社記者也曾見過。確是梵　式而每頁祇只五行的，所以斷定不是明萬曆朝頒的，而是清同治朝頒給的。這是二。</p>
<p>再拿龍華寺本身的歷史來講，照同治縣志和瀛壖雜志的記載，在鹹豐十年（一八六零年）太　軍進攻上海的時候，龍華寺曾經被燬。關於明代頒給的藏經，雖然並沒有說明也曾被燬，但同時也沒有說不曾被燬。所以照我們現在的猜想，除非那時龍華寺的住持預先得到消息將藏經搬走；否則，就是和尚以佛典為重，不惜犧牲性命，情願與佛典同歸西方樂土，在臨時拼命帶著藏經逃避，但是，那末多的一部，就是帶著逃也是不是可能的事。因此我們可以知道明萬曆間頒給的藏經，多半是在那時燒掉了；而現在的一部，也就是清同治朝頒給的。</p>
<p>末了，上海通社對於性空和尚的整理藏經的舉動是很欽佩的；但希望不要將歷史弄錯了，變成上海人所謂向人家「賣野人頭」！</p>

<h3>金融業此後應有之覺悟</h3>
<p>— 汪警石</p>
<p>金融業本爲調劑工商各業金融上週轉的不足，間接輔佐各種產業的興盛，以達到整個的經濟狀况共趨繁榮之途。所以工商業愈發達，金融的週轉也愈形需要，同時金融的業務也愈形繁榮。此所以金融業因工商業的繁榮，而愈趨繁榮，因工商業的發展，而愈形鞏固。反之，工商各業因得金融業的種種扶助，及資金流通的便利，能使各項產業愈形發展，甚至整個社會經濟直接間接皆受其惠。於此金融業對於工商業發展的前途，其功續如何偉大可知；同時工商業對於金融業的繁榮，如何關切又可知。兩者互相爲用，不可偏廢。工商業缺少金融業的資助，進展爲難，金融業欲脫離工商業獨存獨榮，亦爲事實所不可。所以兩者共存，而後可以共榮。如在經濟恐慌的時期，兩者更應互相妥爲籌劃，始克打開僵局。不然必罕兩敗俱傷而後已，此可斷言。但近年來，工商業內受農村破產的影響，外受世界經濟不景氣的侵襲，情勢急轉直下，日就衰落。金融業因國內工商各業的不振，同時又受着美國白銀政策的威脅，也感覺難於應付。於是以前專以救濟及調劑各業資令的金融業，也不得不極力緊縮，而演成非但不能救人，甚至不暇自救的局面。試就去年來各地的錢莊銀行停業倒閉儘量地表現着經濟恐慌的深刻化，金融業的危機正跟着工商業而降臨。這種嚴重性是深值我們注意的。現在且將各地停歇的金融業列表於后：</p>

<p>平湖　二　不詳　市面衰落連年虧折</p>
<p>以上單就錢業項，停歇的已有一百十三家之多；資本總數已在一千萬元左右。冉從各地倒閉的銀行來看，如中國儲蓄銀行，五華銀行，中國興業銀行，儉德銀行，永安銀公司，東方信託公司，華僑信託公司，華東銀行，嘉華銀行，通易銀行，厦門商業儲蓄銀行，安徽銀行，嘉興商業儲蓄銀行，最近停業的又有明華商業儲蓄銀行及外籍美豐銀行等。如從十九年起共計停歇三十餘家，資本三千餘萬元之譜！除以上所舉之例外，遺漏之虛在所難免。若有正確的調查和統計，那是無疑的更屬可觀。假如分析停業的原因，也不外乎資本薄弱，週轉不靈投機失敗地產押欵損失，呆帳過多及提存等等。工商業因爲資助的斷絕，以至一蹶不振亦理所必然。所以年來工商的倒閉消息，絡繹而來筆不勝書，眞使人不寒而慄！但是在這毬危臨眉睫的局面之下，又不能不提出下列的疑問。就是金融業是否聽其自然的趨勢，祇求目前的倖存，甚至不惜與工商分野！工商業也是否就此極力緊縮，而不求掙扎？果眞如此，則兩敗俱傷，無可諱言。如此。欲打開此種僵局，是非金融業負此鉅肩不可，更非金融業注意下列各點不可。</p>
<p>首從錢莊方而言，查其倒閉的原因，綜合起來有：</p>
<p>一資本薄弱　查錢莊的資本大多在二三萬元以至十萬元，試問以數萬元的資金，能够社會的需求？即使可以對付，必須週轉迅速始可無虞，稍感呆滯，破綻立現，如以數萬元資金集中幾個對象，一旦遇有風險，亦有連帶受影響倒閉之險，故此後錢莊同業不如共同合作，集中資本，增厚實力之爲愈，此其一。</p>
<p>二、賬欵呆滯　查錢莊放欵，每以人爲對象，而忽於物質憑信，此點在心理上固受社會的歡迎，而在近世的社會，事業紛繁，决非往昔的簡單，且在經濟局面動盪之中，處處均埋伏着危險的因子。假若放欵的對象一旦發生不宰的事件，放出欵項旣無相當抵押品可以紙補。那末錢莊的本身，立刻就起動搖，此點從放欵受授方面，亟應注意以鍵免危險此其二。</p>
<p>三、組織不善　錢莊的組織多囿於舊式，如投資者一時意氣相投，即行出資組繳，一旦利益不均，往往時起掣肘，不但營業發生影響，即其事業本身亦種危機。且組織之目的，大多僅在如何獲得利潤，並不計及如何擴張，以及對社會如何服務。故每有數十年的錢莊，「依然故我，」此錢業眼光之淺，與進取性之薄弱可知。組繳之不完善，更爲事業進行障碍，此應注意者三。</p>
<p>以上三點係就錢莊而言，次從銀行方面應有覺悟者亦有下列數點：</p>
<p>一、事業過於集中　查全國銀行總行一百四十六家，分支行八百九十一一家，合計一千零三十八家（根據二十二年銀行年鑑），計上每大津北平靑島杭州州南京重慶漢口廣州九市合得總行九十五家占總數百分之六十五，分支行達三百十一家占總數百分之三十，其餘以江浙兩省爲最多，總行共二十四家，占總數百分之十六，分支行計一百八十二家，占總數百分之十八。由此可知我國銀行偏向都市及沿海各省之發展明甚。銀行事業旣集中於同一區域，投資之途必趨狹窄，是資力薄弱者每爲雄厚者所傾壓，勢不得不傾向投機之途，以獲取利潤。此造成銀行過剩而增加恐慌者一。</p>
<p>二、投資過於一致　目前的銀行投資途徑每喜趨於一致，如甲行以爲此業巨做，乙行亦起效尤。於是放欵過濫，一旦遇險，羣受其害。或有新興事業，前途頗有希望者，而需欵孔亟，彼反躊躇不前，我國工商業受此種環境的支配不能興盛甚多。且借欵數額不多，竟有不加以考慮而拒絕，不問其產業前途如何，概不水受。彼寗願以可用於生產之途老，而投資於靡費之處。此眞令人大惑不解，亦非金融業服務應有之態度，更非金融業扶助社會產業之本旨。蓋小資本工商業信用未必弱於大企業，小資本工商業之前途，未必不能達到發展之一日。而目數額較小，放欵取贖較便，危險性較輕，積少成多，獲利的程度也不亞於鉅額放欵。金融業應深切注意者此其二。</p>
<p>三小資本銀行應合併　查各銀行倒閉原因，大多由於資本薄弱，以致一時週轉不靈所至，因此可知小銀行的立是不易。因資本不大在心里上就難獲得顧客的信仰，在吸收存欵方面，就不得不以高利爲號召，冀與較大銀行競爭。同　在資金的出路方面，自然也要獲得較優的利曾。在這種百業凋零的時候，生產事業當然不堪盤剝，於是不得不出於投機的一途，或者不顧危險性的大小，祇求利息的優厚進行。一旦失敗，未有不因此而犧牲。無形的不過增加恐慌程度而已。因此，深切地感覺到，現在的情况之下，我們是不是祇求銀行的數量增加來點綴市面？還是求質地的充實來維持工商業？目前的最大需要，自然是後者。所以懇切盼望着金融業本身，去集合多數的小資本，而爲幾個雄厚有力的資本，在業務上自然可以免除被傾軋的危險，同時也容易獲得社會信仰。將來恐慌的因子也可减去不少此其三。</p>
<p>除以上所述各點以外，尙有金融業共同的通病，就是利息的過高。這不但是工商業受着極大的東縛，不能儘量發展；即金融業的本身也受着阻礙正多，所以此後互須在共同合作的條件之下，亟應减低利息。在存欵方面旣减輕利息，則放欵的利息也可以减輕。於是工商業也得避免不少苛酷的負担；而逐漸有昭蘇和復興的機會。金融業因爲工商業的復蘇，間接就是正當投資的出路擴張！無疑的在這種互相合作的條件之下，經濟恐慌的程度，不難由深刻化而轉到繁榮之途！</p>
<h3>預防旱災</h3>
<p>— 吳曉晨</p>
<p>天災人禍頻仍之中國，每經一次創巨痛深之浩刦，舉國上下，未嘗不惴惴於禍患之重來，而事過境遷，轉眼若忘，終未見防患於未然，弭害於無形。卽以水旱而言。幾於無歲無之，他可見矣。去夏旱荒之烈，開六十年未有之嚴重現象，受災省分，有蘇·浙·皖·贛·湘·那·豫·冀·甘·黔·晋等十一省之多，凡六百三十五縣。受災面積，計三萬二千九百萬市畝，當十一省耕地面積百分之四七。所受損失，據事後估計，以數量言，計稻二萬一千六百萬市担，高　三千一百二十萬市担，玉米二千五百萬市担，小米四千萬市祖，棉花六百萬市擔，大豆三萬一千六百萬市擔；以價値言：稱値六萬八千四百萬元，高粱値七千二百萬元，玉米値六千七百萬元，大豆値一萬二千九百萬元，棉花値一萬九千九百萬元，小米値九萬一千七百萬元，共達十七萬餘萬元之鉅！去秋受災各縣，甚有顆粒無收，哀鴻遍野，餓莩載途。今日回想此種驚心動魄之數字，能不於誠惶誠恐之餘，悟已往之不諫，知來者之可追乎？</p>
<p>江浙二省水利，河道縱橫，素以優越稱於他省。且各縣在田賦項下，尙帶征水利經費，水利建設，宜不患無費經營，然而亢旱之來，亦惟坐視無策，不獲俸免。滿望今春蠶絲起色，失之重隅者收之榆桑，豈知繭價之低落，旣倍甚於往昔，而捐稅之繫重，復有增而無减。困苦流離，不堪言狀。此日時逢霉令，耕耨方始，農田盼雨正殷，無如豫魯冀等省，旣告早於前，靈寳各地，泥土乾裂，傳言花籽無由播種。近則皖南亦見早象，夭苗枯萎，而徐海各屬，已二月無透雨，甚至田地燥裂，四鄉農民，紛紛祈雨。京常等處，亦農田皆涸，旱災將成。兩浙農田之景象，秧長數寸，無水可挿，而連日南風習習，天晴氣朗，無絲毫霉令氣象，不知雨至何日，若再不急起預防，今年仍旱，民無噍類。在去年早甚之時，亦未嘗不思及水利，大舉募債，欲用爲災區工振，而事實如何，或許災區廣大，有非吾民所能知也。吾人以爲今日防災，應注重於三點：挽救所能，一戽水器械之廣置，二河道之疏濬，二種植抗旱之物，姑分論之：</p>
<p>農村原有戽水之器具，或藉風力，或賴牲畜，引水之能力甚微，去歲浩旱之候，上則　陽施威，下乃河水日淺，水車之長度旣有限，灌溉未易，田畝之需水倍增，供應更難，農民雖日以繼夜，並以人力濟牲畜及風力之所不及，而禾苗仍不免於枯萎，此蓋杯水輿薪，非原有戽水器具所能濟事也。惟農家年來幾經顚沛，日處於貧窮綫以下，欲購置切合實用之打水機，實爲能力所不許，去年雖承各界酌爲購辦，以救眉急，乃粥少僧多，未能普遍收效，而打水機之有利於嚴事，非原有戽水器具所可比擬，則爲任何人所習知。爲今之道，預防旱災之初步工作，亟須廣置打水機，如能運用電氣灌漑尤佳，政府應咨令各省，轉飭各市縣，通盤籌劃，並由政府予以財力上之援助。</p>
<p>猶憶去夏旱魃施虐，地形較高之處，河水盡涸，甚至飮料亦發生恐慌。而河道之上流之居民，又爭相截堵，居於下流者，致欲謀滴水而不得。故河道之疏濬。非特上述各渠工程，應趕速完成，而其他支河小流，亦須兼籌並顧，否則雖有打水機，亦徒然耳；</p>
<p>各地農作物，因農民心理之未盡同，並未一致，一省如此，一縣如此，甚至一鎭一村亦如此。而中國農民，在靠天吃飯心理之下，一切盈虛消長，又繫之於天，隨大自然之演化，不能運月人力來隨機應變；且在農民一貫思想之下，很少改進農事之機會。故如去年爲大旱所籠罩之嘉興農田，就得到絕不相同之結果：嘉南王店一帶，均是稻田，在在需要水量，旱荒之後，無法供應，致稻枯土裂，顆粒無穫。但是嘉北新豐一帶之薑田，却收獲奇佳，因爲薑田需要水量極微，且畏酷熱暑天，突然雷雨，有使薑莖全部發瘟之危險。去夏亢旱期間，非特無雷，並且無雨，如此天時，最適官於薑之發榮滋長，所以去歲薑田，因爲過程良好而豐收，適與王店一帶稻田相反。尙有海寗縣屬之稻田，亦十九枯死，獨黃灣棉田，不因旱災而失其本來生長力，適與稻田反，平常年歲，不愁缺水，祗恐水多，所以絲毫不爲大旱所影響。本來如海寗海鹽二縣，在浙西比較地形最高，水旱年歲，引水灌田，較任何一縣爲不易，所以二縣農田，是否宜於永久種稻，已有研究之必要。天災年有之中國，一時旣無積極方法，可以防止災害之發生，於是不得不多種耐早作物，希冀减少災害之程度。</p>

<p>翻開一九三五年蘇聯經濟史，殺重要之一頁，莫如取銷計口授糧也。過去一年之中，蘇聯各業之薪給標準，曾有重大變更。央年三月十七日，政府明令改正勞工法，及取銷全蘇各地最低薪給制度之限制；蓋幾年來蘇聯實業界，定有低薪制度，所謂低薪云者，有甚多工廠，皆有保證，但此新法令僅在取銷一般工人所獲低薪之限制。惟各種實業，萬一陷入停頓之狀態中，工人並無過失者，則工人應得平時工薪三分之一一。自去年六月一日起，薪給制度，在反對方面，再度變更，爲使調和口糧中麵包漲價所發生之影響起見，明令各業工薪，增加百分之十至十五。根據官塲所發表之消息，則此新法令頒佈以後，最有裨益者，當推四百二十萬獲薪最低之工人，彼等所獲工資，目前平均每月九十二盧布，（此種工人包括低級礦工一四〇，〇〇〇人）開支方面，月僅七十九盧布。數星期後，又頒佈補充法一條，予僱工之「工作與軍事有相當關係者」一，另外增加工薪百分之十。惟此種薪給制度之更改，所予工人之利益，結果因政府方面同時减低工人用盧布購物之値價，已不幸而成爲空中樓閣。不僅將麵包之售價提高，且又變更供給之制度。自五年之前，蘇聯重採計口授糧分券制度而後，盧布之値價，並無一定之標準，在任何時期，以所有主及供應物之來源而定。得有特權之人，盧布一個，可代表麵包三磅五盎司，或乳油六盎司之値價。然待遇較薄之人，所持之盧布，祇可換得麵包十一又四分之三盎司，或同樣之乳油一盎司。工廠工人，可得最便宜之食糧，其中如麵包則每日可以最低價換得，食糧之中，麵包券可常期分到，罕於肉食，乳油，麥粉，及其他產量較少之物，自上年初起，亦可分得，惟無定期而限量又不足也。</p>
<p>所謂計口授糧，在蘇聯創於一九一七年。惟在十年之前，早爲蘇維埃聯邦政府所取銷。在實施新經濟政策時代（一九二一九二八）容許私人企業及營利事項，食糧及其他商品，在極少之限制下，得在商店及市塲上公開出售，即珍奇貨品，及貨物定價，亦不受限制。至一九二九年，蘇聯又再度採用一種混亂之物品計口分配制度，包括食糧，衣服，及其他各種物品，視爲五年經濟計劃之一部。至於各種商店，在其他各國所習見者，在蘇聯則一概取銷之，約有三年之久。蘇聯人民，若未得當局之容許，雖一雙鞋子，或一塊肥皂之取得，亦視爲違法。此種分配制度，今日已完全取銷矣。最近在共產黨大會席上，國內供給人民委員長密柯楊氏，曾報告此種制度失敗之經過，是故共產黨在理想之中，早已决定恢複容許公開商店之商品買賣，採取「國營商店」之新制度，而直接售貨與顧客，事實上物品計口分配制度，早已取消，除食糧而外，其他商品，目前在各種商店中，皆可購得，即量的方面，亦不受限制。惟此種商店，所有商品，售價皆由政府規定，實爲一般顧客之不幸耳。所定物價，對於蘇維埃低級工人，實覺過高。在此種公開商店中，大致牛油每磅八盧布，肉食每磅二又十分之二盧布，糖每磅四又二分之一盧布，茶每磅八盧布，鷄蛋每笙二分之一盧布，是故工人每月所得工資九十二盧布，可換得之商品，則有限也。即物價而用金鎊計算，亦屬無補。莫斯科官塲方面，所規定之滙兌率，除國外之遊客，需照價兌換而外，別無其他用意。至於特別之商店，供應顧客所需，而顧客携有外幣者，官塲所定之滙兌率，即蘇維埃當局方面，亦並不重視也。</p>
<p>工廠工人，過去幾年之中，每日可以最低之價格，購到常期分配之麵包，及其他不定期分配之食物，是故所得工資雖低，而生活尙能維持。乃自前年六月工人地位之變更，使其生活反見困難，工薪之增加，適足使其失去例入領取最低價食糧之資格。工人每日所需，目前仍爲麵包二磅五分之一，及其他若干食物。乃渠在今日，每月所得之九十二盧布，巳較前年所得之八十三盧布値價爲少，各種貨物，在公開市場，渠固皆可購得，乃物價方面，較之國營商店，高貴不少。此外尙有外僑給養商店，專供外僑購物者，貸品頗多，惟專用外國貨幣，或貴重金屬，而不供給蘇聯工人之購物也。農民獲價之低，及都市居民付價之高，究屬如何，官塲方面，向無解釋。農產品之取得方法，及運往都市，完全在國家掌握之中，都市居民直接交易，一年之中，僅在春冬二季。農民對政府完了繳穀義務而後，規定幾個月爲容許之期，以貨易貨，完全不准。以私人資格而爲居間人者，已公然消減。蓋居間人如介紹農人之生產品，以供工廠之消耗，其中可取得甚多之利益，而彼之地位，今日已完全由政府替代此新居間人，所取利率，除各國之商人能加以夢想外，局外人實不得而知，我人已可證明蘇聯國內糧食之供應，完全由政府專賣矣。</p>
<p>一般農民，凡適於耕種之土地，每百畝均須完納規定之穀類，作爲强迫繳稅。所餘之穀，由政府機關及國有合作機關，根據特別法令，勸誘依照議定價格售與彼等，上述兩種方法，所取得之穀類，用以供給軍隊，工廠，商店，及出口之用。農民所得穀類，用以繳納强迫稅者，蕎麥每噸値七二盧布，小麥八八盧布，同樣之穀類，農民自動售與國家者，蕎麥每噸九〇盧布，小麥一〇〇盧布。政府方面，將此種蕎麥，躉批與各廠者，每噸之售價爲五二五盧布，小麥產六〇〇盧布，而此種榖類，則由工廠方面，磨成麵粉用以製作低價麵包者。是故政府方面，在計口授糧制度之下，售與工廠之穀類，獲利有六倍之多。國營商店所售之麵包，蕎麥製成者，每磅一又四分之三盧布，小麥製成者每磅兩盧布，獲利更多。故國營商店公開出售之麵包，較之政府直接分配農民者，顧客須多出三四十倍之售價也。政府方面，對於都市居民，所需麵包之供給，大有一手包辦之概，乃爲顯著之事。所集毅類，量的方面，用以供應軍隊及都市之需要者，無論如何，不甚適當。至於農民之對於此種制度，是否贊同，並無明白表示，而當局對此問題，亦無興趣顧及耳。政府宣稱計口分券制度，决計取消，準備使全國民衆，所需之物，完全設新商店供給之，設政府而有意使商店方面，食糧之售價，與實業之工薪，得以均等，則事屬易舉。政府方面，目前由都市居民所微稅率之內，將犧牲一大部分，惟其中所獲利益，仍覺不當，個中原委，想各國經營相同之商店者，必能知之。所謂犧牲云者，如工薪之提高，或物價之低减，或兩者並用，在政府取消中央物品計口分配制度，重設公開商店之前，委爲主要問題，蓋使民衆完全離開物品計口分配制度，而工薪，物價，事前不加訂正，則不啻將低薪之勞工及壓入餓死之途耳。</p>

<h3>在文學上的肯定與否定</h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>現實主義作家，由於世界觀的矛盾，在作品裏所取理的肯定與否定的相互强調和衝突，能演成一幕最大的悲劇。</p>
<p>這裏所指的肯定與否定，是和哲學上所說的肯定和否定相同。</p>
<p>不用說，忠實於現實的作家，是毫無容赦地描寫現實，這個作家的作品，必然地能呈現出現實社會的否定而和肯定面，例如在巴爾札克和果戈里的作品裏，都呈現了作為否定面的貴族階級與封建地主，作為肯定面的中產階級。</p>
<p>所謂在時代前面的作家，乃是肯認了這肯定面，必然地導前進的社會到發展的路上去，也就是替這個新的社會作指南的工作。</p>
<p>果戈里的作品裏，雖然很適宜地描寫了肯定和否定一方面，果戈里自己說：他的作品是通過哭的笑，的確在他的作品裏的笑，都處處含着眼淚；這原因是什麼呢，是他在悲哀某種人之無能。如果在他的作品裏，肯定能擊退否定時，（即瞭知某種人的必然沒落，而為肯定努力），則就毫無悲劇了！然而他山於肯定的加强而就更固執地强調起否定，使之相互對壘，因此構成了悲劇！因為現實的姿態，好實地聲言着肯定的發展！笑就從眼淚裏进了出來，由於以上的原因，果戈里祇是個卓越的描寫眞實的作家，祗是個批判的現實主義作家，他之希冀否定而的重甦，使他必能成為走在時代前面的作家，因為如上所述，他不曾替新社會作指南的工作。</p>
<p>所以，在作品裏的關於否定與肯定的取理，其最適當的方法，是將否定成為肯定的發展之過程，描寫出否定面的漸趨滅亡，而更襯映出肯定面的活生生之成長。</p>
<p>有些批評家，認為在現代那麽混亂的社會裏——尤其在我們所住的社會裏，應該著重於否定的描寫，因為否定面的無能，走頭無路，罪惡，正需要作家來如實的訴說。不僅如此，因為現在的作家，大都出身於知識階級，所以是遠離着在社會上的積極的存在底，因此知道那積極的存在也就頗為困難，由於此，那對於消極的存在之描寫就必要起來，這種描寫消極的存在之工作，是現代作家力所能及的地方，所謂描寫消極的存在，即是側重於否定的描寫。</p>
<p>我們覺得這種論法，未免機械，因為他把否定和肯定給截斷了，祇局限於否定的描寫，其成就祗是暴露或是批判的現實主義，而不是我們所須要的。</p>
<p>說到這裏，或許讀者起來一種反問，即是「專側重於肯定就好了吧！」實際上，僅側重於肯定，一樣的是種錯誤，雖然我們如道未來的社會是怎樣，但這絕不是抽象的東西，是歷史的實踐所吿訴我們的，我們雖能想像，但却不能離了實踐，祇是描寫肯定，而撤棄否定，則這種肯定向就成了魔術師變出來的世界，不是從否定面裏，變化過來的東西了。</p>
<p>最近我讀完了一部很好的柞品，即是蕭洛珂夫的「被開拓了的處女地」，這部作品，不僅描寫出集團農塲發展的過程，尤其在取理肯定與否定點上，給我們以卓越的敎訓。</p>
<p>蕭洛珂夫是把集團農塲運動的指導者達衛道夫，作為肯定的要素，以藝術的地正確的姿態，使之元立在第一線上，同時那作為否定的要素之白軍大尉波羅菲埃夫。富晨雅各夫。爾基支。不帶稍稍的客觀主義的陰影，以眞實的姿態，作着與達衛道夫相反的工作，如實地描出來了否定面的如何沒落，肯定面的如何邁進。正靠這種根本勢力的衝突，產生出多樣的積極的性格，製造出新的塲面，通過了個人的姿態，生出來社會的Pathos，也就更能使讀者瞭知了正在發展的社會之困苦和成長。</p>
<p>所以，在描寫眞實上，我們對於肯定與否定，需互相取理，不能側重一方，靠着進步的世界觀，將否定的沒落之描寫，作為肯定的成長之表現。</p>
<h3>黃昏</h3>
<p>— 莫孚</p>
<p>……突然之間，在他心中有一種决定；於是所有的結，全然由此解開了。他的胸彷彿漫野般空嚝。妻的枯皺的臉，四個孩子的慘呌……頓然從他記憶里躱開，不復使他煩惱</p>
<p>他順着熱鬧的大街走着，恰如走在沙漠中一樣，絲毫不曾察覺在他周圍正包撤着為生存而忙迫的車馬行人。溜過他眼前的，不能引起他注意，耳朶亦聽不到吵雜的騷音。他追隨在走我他前面的人的背後，流水似的，這中間彷彿有條不可知的，看不見的什麽線，連擊着，</p>
<p>半點鐘之後，他步在眞實的嚝野。不知自什麼時候開始，已只剩他獨自個兒，孤零零的，左右搖擺着身子向西方！那躱避在深藍色的，黑色的山巒背後的太陽，發射着輻條似的餘光，形成半圓的輪齒。包圍着的是緋紅的，而紅的，紫的…各色雲彩那兒移動。從他背後，遙遠處擁來一層薄暗；這正與黎明相反，愈來愈濃，不停止地在變化着。</p>
<p>太陽由這罪惡的世界上收回它最後的光輝，人世間的一切，彷彿亦將隨之而消失了。</p>
<p>他漠然地移動着為某種外力支配着的雙腿，兩手合攏在胸前，眼前是空虛的，無際限的灰暗。</p>
<p>他跨過田野，走到江岸，站住了脚。沒有風。淡黃的月亮超過他頭項，印在平穩如鏡的水面。他凝視着這江中月影，元然不動，彷彿為死者超渡而祈禱的魔師。繼續着，的模三分鐘光景，他忽有所思地縱身入江—這突來的動作使他自己異常吃驚，但是在這一剎那間使他感到是眞正解放了—向這微睡而敏感的黃昏投以悽然的一擊，顫慄的響聲直飄上太空。平穩的水面，這時彷彿溶解了的玻璃在灶中沸騰似的，許多個白色小山高隆江面，骨碌骨碌舞蹈。淡黃的月影，為水的激動，盪漾着，消失了。</p>
<p>夜色更深，復歸於靜寂。</p>

<p>農忙時期，我們學校裏照例放「忙假」，讓成年人去割麥插秧，讓女人們能作飯送飯戽水，孃小孩子們去看牛，抱娃，看塲。到夜晚，如果天氣太熱，恰巧又是月朗星明天色，出過力氣的人們，願意乘點風涼時候，我們便請他們一起聚在關帝廟！我們校舍門前廣塲，各自携來茶壺烟袋，隨意淸認。</p>
<p>在這淸談會開始的時候，我們是特竟把新年廟會時候的煤氣燈掛上一盞，那耀眼的光芒頓使皎月减色，同時希望同人可以借此機會溫溫千字課，念念老少通，或者隨章講個故事時，也可以互相看見笑臉，可是事情出乎意外，四面八方的昆蟲也都隨着四方八方的隣居來到會，我們看到蝗蟲滿院飛，螻蛅到處爬，較大些的孩子為爭奪竟撕打起來，哭聲紛起；千千萬萬的浮塵子，撲燈蛾蓋滿了燈，金龜子頓起頓落像飛石似的打人頭，蚊蟲有如一陣狂風裏面的灰塵，到處都是。這樣一來，秩序大壞，不獨感覺不到夜風送爽，反而一個個人都弄得滿頭大汗。</p>
<p>看到這情形，有如翻開一本舊　簿。我便忽的想到我在作治蟲員的時候，為了一盞油燈竟聞下一件大禍，這事情無論何時我每一想到便感到心疚。本來清淸談會上是允許我們隨便講話的，我便設法滅了燈裏的火，在大家眼前一黑之下，很重的鼓了幾下手掌，止着這嘈雜的喊呌。</p>
<p>「今天有個故事，說給諸位聽聽，請諸位多留點意。</p>
<p>一前兩年我在一個地方幹捉蟲子的事情，像今天來到我們這裏的蟲子，全是我要捉的，我捉了他們，殺死他們，免得他們害莊稼。那時候，我們的辦法是不單我們捉，還要請各位作田的人，一起來捉，我們是家家戶的敲門，講說道理，請他們帮忙。</p>
<p>「我們是要每一家都在他們自己的地裏向裝一盞電燈，燈下面放一個大水盆，當然嘍，水不能泡着燈的。我們還要他們在水盆裏撒一點煤油，諸位在書上念過的，煤油的氣味虫子怕，煤油弄到虫子身上，虫子就死掉，糞缸一裏撒過煤油就沒有蛆……」</p>
<p>在滅燈後一忽時候，人羣是靜寂的，可是過了不久，人羣中便又有了聲音，小孩子哭了，笑了，尖銳的喊一聲，大人們的耳語，烟袋鍋子扣地的聲響……女人們掉了東西，借洋火，劃洋火，火光起處便牽動了前前後後的視綫。我的話很難完全抓着他們，他們，卽使是我們的合作社放欵時，我們講話，也是像油鍋中水泡的爆裂。</p>
<p>「我叫他們預備，我們出傢具，他們出油，你們請猜猜，他們照不照我們吿訴的法子作？……」</p>
<p>我不能不用更大的力氣講，史不能不使話中生出波瀾來使聽眾的腦子動一下。雖然，這樣的效果還是不太大。</p>
<p>「他們，眞不像你們諸泣這麼聰明，他們一點不相信我們的話，那天點燈的夜裏，我騎着自行車查一下，只有四五處是點燈的，餘下的全把燈點在目己屋裏，男的睡覺，女的補衣服，諸位，你們也許想不到，這幾家點燈的是受了大害。……」</p>
<p>我揮揮手，用更大的聲音說：</p>
<p>「像今天一樣的，四面八方的虫子全來在這塊地裏，虫子太多，捕虫燈沒有用，這幾塊地，這幾塊地的好百姓，到現在還是駡我們使他沒收成，許多不點捕虫燈的人，也在旁面說：「看呵，看呵，我早就知道是害人的」諸位，這是我們害他們，還是作田的不齊心害他們？——為了這緣故，學堂裏，不是怕花錢，而是怕這一方冉受這種害，以後；這盞燈不再點了。……」</p>
<p>以後，我們夏天黑夜淸談每人帶支香，永遠不點燈。</p>
<h3>小妞的心肝</h3>
<h3>人造瘋子（上）</h3>
<p>— 何洛</p>
<p>一、</p>
<p>父親是一個窑主，有二三十個窑黑子，從九更到半夜，鑽在地底下，給他發掘地球的寳藏。財產就和煤堆一樣的堆集起來。</p>
<p>母親也是一個有毒性的女八，打兒媳婦專打腦袋和肚子，可以把她肚裏的孩子打得小產下來，脊背上和腿上也都是傷痕。</p>
<p>瘋子是他們的第四個兒子。</p>
<p>他二十歲的時候，巳經長成一個十分堅實的小夥子了。手膊子很有氣力，和他的父母們一樣，抓住窑黑子的頭皮，死也不肯放手。但是不放手還好，一放手那就更糟了，磚頭，石頭或木棍，只要拿到手的，什麽東西都可以隨使打上去。如果拿起來的是切菜刀，他就威嚇着，要割掉別人的耳朶。</p>
<p>父母們雖然有點當心，怕他闖下禍，但打的究竟是窑黑子——照他們的道理，審黑子是靠窑主生活的，如果沒有窑主，窑黑子除了討吃以外，是什麽也不會生活的。</p>
<p>有時候就很得竟的誇講着說，窑黑子生來就是壞種，不給他吃點辣的，他就不知道你的好處。</p>
<p>可是不幸的事情發生了。鑽在地底下，用勞動征服自然，創造財富的窑黑子，只管取煤，把地球取空了，地球突然一下塌下來，壓死十七個。十七個壓成一個分辨不淸誰是誰的肉餅子。</p>
<p>以後窑主的生意就一天不如一天，新叫來的窑黑子，做不上幾天就被別的窑主勾引走了。到最後只剩下三五個人，支持着衰落的門面。</p>
<p>窰主的家裏，也就從暗鬥變成明鬥，從前對付窑黑子的手段，現在都拿來使用在家裏了。父子兄弟之間，從早吵到晚，又從晚吵到早，吵着吵着就打起架來，打得頭破血流。</p>
<p>其中最蠻幹的是他們的第四個兒子。</p>
<p>他從小就學會駡人和打人的一切手法了。現在他可以一腦袋碰倒他的母親。如果父親拿起棍子來，他就順手一拉一推，把父親顚蹶在地上。父親還沒有爬起來，他早巳很響亮的駡着，呌着，跑到大街上去了。</p>
<p>很可以說，兄弟們都和惡狗一樣，啃足後跟是很利害的。隨時都瞪開眼睛，聳直眉毛，挺起胸脯，開口就駡，伸手就打，從房裏打到院裏，從院裏打到街上。七八隻手像捲鬚葉似的緾在別人身上，大家一齊滾倒在地上，滾夾滾去，你看不淸究竟誰在打誰。</p>
<h3>大學時代（四）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>雷娜麗不在她們中間：她孤獨地站在離門不遠的地方，帶點憂鬰神氣眺視那此姑娘們；她們活潑地談着話，在別人的華麗的屋子裏不顯出一點拘束樣子：她們簡直不來理會她。</p>
<p>再沒有比靑年人更自利和更殘忍了。但我進來之後，接着市長夫人也走了進來。她向這些靑年人行了禮，並像弗里茨所說的出她那大將軍眼光向大堂上掃射一過以後，便走到娜麗身邊，握着她的手。「要使一對對跳舞的人能够相配稱起見，」她對跳舞師說，「那麼就請你把男孩子們按照身裁高低排起隊來罷！」—跳舞師照着她的話做了，同時她又走到女孩子跟前去，照樣也要把她們排列起來。驟站晨底金黃色頭髮的女兒，身子最高，幾乎比別人高出一個頭。她就被位置在我們對面的牆邊：但接着難題就出來了。『我不知道，夏綠蒂。』市長夫人說。「你和娜麗二人誰上誰下，因為在我看來你們是一樣地高！」</p>
<p>這夏綠蒂是一位宮廷侍候兼審判官底女兒，她便向後退步。「娜麗小姐大概比我高些」，她輕輕地說。</p>
<p>「怎麽呢，我的小姐，』我的朋友底母親呼喚她，「從你那角落裏走出來吧，來同娜麗小姐比比看！」</p>
<p>這小姑娘不得不走出來，背對背向裁縫女兒較量一下。但—我眼睛看得很明白她有本事，使工匠女兒底黑頭幾乎沒有和她的頭相接觸。</p>
<p>這小姑娘穿着一套淺淡的衣裳。雷娜麗則穿一套帶有紅條子的黑色羊毛衣服，頸上圍了一條白色縐紗肩巾。這套衣服顏色太深暗了，令人發生新異的感覺，但同她恰很配稱的。</p>
<p>市長夫人把這兩個女孩子比看了一會。『夏綠蒂』她說，「往常時你是頭個美人；但你要小心不要讓她超過你啊！我看她是要超過你的。』</p>
<p>聽到這話時，我仿佛看見小姑娘底黑眼睛發出光來。</p>

<h3>青海學校衛生檢查報告</h3>
<p>— 靑海省衛生實騐處張文山　邵俠賢</p>
<p>健康敎育委員會自去臘底成立迄今，時已五月，初因候嚴寒長期寒假關係，以及醫　人員均係兼任性質，致延至四月十三日起，始開始進行本會主要之工作「學校衛生」。此雖遲遲興起，要亦環境所促使，而莫可奈何者也。</p>
<p>本會因醫務人員缺少之故，僅能於每日下午抽時前往各校實施衛生敎育與治療等事宜，現已着手進行之學校凡十處。一俟醫務人員充足時，將自省垣所有各中小學辦起，務期使靑年男女均獲得良好之衛生敎育與習慣並體格健全之幸福，以爲他日倡辦衛生事業之羣英，茲將施行健康檢查後之缺點統計，分系如下：</p>
<p>受檢查總人數四百八十二人，（內回敎促進會第一中學，百八十八人，第二小學一百四十人，以上均係男性、第一女子師節附屬小學一百五十四人，內有一男性，其餘爲女性）</p>
<p>有缺點人數四百零六人。</p>
<p>缺點總例數。一零二人。</p>
<p>缺點類別：</p>
<p>視力不良：輕五五人重一二人最重三人合共十七人</p>

<p>腹股溝疝氣：一人</p>
<p>包莖過長：一二人</p>
<p>觀上表：可知靑年男女學生，並非一一健全，雖在每日上課，個人本身之健全，非用體格檢查，實無由發覺，本會檢杳方式，採用中央衛生署所頒佈之健康檢查格式爲標準，舉凡體重，身長、視力，聽力、營養以及耳，目，口，鼻，心，肺，脾，淋巴腺，甲狀腺，生殖器等等。無一不在檢查之列，所得之結果，卽以「輕」、「重」，「最重」等符號表示缺點之輕重，與夫是否需要急切之治療或矯治，此皆爲健康檢查後之要圖，雖然，以醫院缺乏之關係，致大小便血液等，無法得有系統之檢查，以及發現重要之缺點無由矯治，此亦本會之恨事也。例如上表之扁桃腺肥大、包莖截去割治，非用手術及住院療治不可。願社會人仕，對於衛生事業之提倡，熱心創造醫院，俾造福一般靑年男女，而爲將來之在社會國家謀建設也。</p>
<h3>冤獄賠償與醫訟</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>全國律師協會，近努力進行寃獄賠償運動，并以六月五日爲宣傳日，此種保障人權之運動，實爲中國數千年來空前之創舉，義意至爲重大也，夫法治之國家，政府對於人民，有負法律上保障之責任，不幸而有寃獄之構成，在人民固受名譽，身體，精神，財產上之損失，在政府實負有不能保障人民法益之缺憾，文明之國家，不能使天下無訟，亦不能使天下有寃，賠償云者，僅事後之一種補救而已！一方使受害者稍償其名譽及金錢上之損失於萬一，一方使誣告者知所警惕，司法者愼重從事，意至善，法至美也。顧此風行全歐之良法，而至今竟未實現於吾靑天白日旗幟下之國家，此實不能不引爲遺憾者也，今律界諸公以職業之故，身見寃獄之衆多，大聲疾呼，力謀補救，信乎仁者之用心，而吾人之所當聯合一致以附和之，而促本運動之早日實現者也。</p>
<p>訴訟案件，有與日俱增之勢，而中間屬於寃獄者實不知凡幾，何以見之？於醫病雙方之訟案見之，鄙人厠身醫界，對於病家控告醫師之案伴，耳所聞目所睹者衆矣！顧其結果—勝訴多屬於醫師—於此可見病家之控告醫師，大半出於誣告矣。夫天下之公理，祇有一耳，此是則彼非、此非則彼是，故原被二告，决無同是或同非者，被告敗訴，則原告之控告爲合法，被告勝訴，則原告之爲誣告已無可諱言矣。誣告而不負賠償之責任，則不獨人權無保障，而國家最尊嚴之法律亦輕等弁毛，根究敗訴之原因，如由法官之誤斷，則構成寃獄之責任，當由司法者負之，亦理之至公者也，抑吾聞之，名譽者人生之第二生命也，而醫之爲業，尤以名譽之良竄爲標準，一爲病家所控告，則報紙之官揚、社會之責備，早已騰於悠悠之口，無論其勝負之結果如何，要其難得易失之名譽已一落千丈，故醫病訟案中，醫師所受名譽之損失爲鉅，而金錢與精神身體猶次之，朗使誣告之病家罔斷之法院事後賠償，而從前之令譽，亦無能恢復於一時矣，矧一無所償耶。或者以爲病人之控醫師，並非完全有意誣告，大半由於其法律知識之不足，情可原也，不知醫之爲學，至爲專門，而病之無法醫救者，亦殊常見，病者之死於病抑死於醫，雖深於醫學者，亦難作局外之觀察，矧病家之於醫學一無所知者乎。故以法律知識言之，病家僅戚不足，以醫學知識言之，病家則根本毫無，不知而妄言之，非出於一時之意氣，卽出於有意之敲詐明矣，若不要求賠償，何以減少此後之醫訟於萬一乎，吾故表而出之，以告吾醫界，並告訟之病家與武斷之法官焉</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（五十九）急性關節風濕痺Acuteoarticulal'Rheumatism</p>
<p>（問）什麼呌做急性關節風濕庳？</p>
<p>（答）是多數的關節，急性的起疼痛相腫脹，並且全身　熱的疾病。</p>
<p>（問）這種病是怎樣起的？</p>
<p>（答）這種病，也是一種傳染病，但病原未明，大概是一種鏈球菌或萄葡狀球菌的傳染，而發生爲他方性或流行性的狀一態。</p>
<p>（問）這病的誘因是什麼？</p>
<p>（答）感胃往往爲急性風濕痺的誘因；其次像不適當的居屋，不良的天氣，都可以誘發這病。尤其在霉雨潮濕的季節更易發病。</p>
<p>（問）和職業與年齡有沒有關係？</p>
<p>（答）凡粗賤的操勞者像車夫，婢僕等最多發生這種病患。年齡以十五歲到三十五歲最多。</p>
<p>（問）急性關節風濕痺，在將發病的時候</p>
<p>先現怎樣的情形？</p>
<p>（答）病人覺全身倦怠，容易疲勞，四肢硬勁：也有發各種黏膜炎症狀的。</p>
<p>（問）到了已經發病之後，起些什麼病狀？</p>
<p>（答）關節的罹患，非常急激，尤其先侵下肢的大關節；其後侵犯多數關節。大都從一個關節，立刻波及他關節的。</p>
<p>（問）病人的身體，是否也像別的傳染病一樣發熱？</p>
<p>（答）是的。但發熱並不很高。很少超過攝氏表二十九度的。而熱度的上昇，又跟着關節的病勢；凡新犯一個關節的時候，髒溫必定上昇一次。</p>
<p>（問）發熱時，同時起全身症狀嗎？</p>
<p>（答）也有的。像頭痛，昏惜，和熱感等。</p>
<p>（問）急性關節風濕痺，在關節內發生的局部疾患，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）以侵犯關節滑膜，關節囊或鞬鞘，黏液囊爲主；間或侵及肌膜和肌鞘。最初在大關節，尤其是膝足肘或手關節起炎症，其次波及到肩和胯關節，最後更犯手根，足跟和指趾等小關節。被侵的關節，槪起潮紅，臐脹，熱感和疼痛，就是定型的炎症症狀。其中疼痛非常劇烈，於是各關節的運動，都受妨碍。</p>
<p>（問）循環器，在這時候也起病變嗎？</p>
<p>（答）急性關節風濕痺，往往要侵犯心臟的：所以常合併心內膜炎，心囊炎和心肌炎等症。</p>
<p>（問）心內膜炎怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）風濕痺時的心內膜炎，最多的是僧帽瓣或大動脈瓣。瓣膜內面發生疣狀物。結果起僧帽瓣閉鎖不全或狹窄，和大動脈瓣閉鎖不全。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（五十一）慢性化膿性中耳炎（俗稱耳漏）</p>
<p>講到慢性化膿性中耳炎的一個病症。就是一般俗間所稱爲的耳漏。大都由於急性中耳炎轉移而來。由臨診上看起來。本病在耳科各種疾病當中。要算最占多數。尤以兒童時代患者爲多。這是因爲急性中耳炎的原因（譬如麻疹，實扶的里，百日咳，痘瘡，肺炎等）。也是在兒童時代最多的緣故。其中尤以在</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>患急性中耳炎的時候。沒有得到適當的治療。或因營養不良。或因腺病質的虛弱。更易使牠轉移變爲慢性化膿性中耳炎。</p>
<p>慢性化膿性中耳炎患者所感覺的痛苦。最顯著的就是難聽與耳鳴。有時且可發生疼痛，頭痛，頭重，眩暈，惡心，嘔吐，及步行蹣跚等等症侯。我們如果用耳鏡來檢查。則見外聽道常有糜爛。膿汁存在深部。膿汁的性狀不一。有時爲粘液膿性。有時爲純膿性。膿汁有時放出特異的惡臭。牠的分量。有多有少。而無一定。若將這種膿性分泌物拭淸後。卽可察見鼓膜的穿孔。穿孔的部位，形態，及大小。各有不同。但是本病的鼓膜穿孔。多爲大穿孔。决不會像急性中耳炎的那樣小。在病勢劇烈的時候。鼓膜竟可完全缺損。穿孔通常祇有一個。形態多爲圓形，橢圓形，心臟形或腎臟形。部位普通祇有中心性及綠立性的兩種。在鼓膜全部缺損。或在大穿孔時。往往得見鼓室的粘膜。爲紅薔薇樣色。或爲帶黃紅色。或爲紫赤色。屢屢腫脹。表面或者平滑。或者凹凸不平。發生顆粒狀的肉芽。有時形成有莖的耳茸腫。因此妨礙膿汁的排出。而致引起危險合併症的很多。此外還有發生所謂中耳眞珠腫者。常能崩壞骨質。這也是很易引起危險合併症的一種徵象。至於本病最危險的時期。就是形成顯顯骨骨瘍及骨疽。續發腦膜炎，腦膿瘍，靜脈竇栓塞。膿毒症，或因病勢侵蝕血管壁而來劇烈的大出血等等。因爲均有生命的關係。所以本病的預後。我旣不敢言佳。又不敢言惡。不過在身體强健營養佳良的患者。若能早期施行適當的療法。當然可以避去危險得到治愈的結果的。但是我在臨診上所見的耳漏患者。他們患病的期間。大都少則已有一二年。多則十餘年。有的竟已至老年。此時的病變惰形。異常複雜。如欲完全治愈。殊非易事。同時尙須愼防危險合併症的駕臨。所以本病最好早期施行適當的療法。千萬不可遷延時日。不予治療爲要。</p>
<h3>現代花柳病學通俗講話（五）</h3>
<p>— 陳生白（編述）殷木强（校正）</p>
<p>第七章　關於黴毒之治療</p>
<p>黴毒之特效藥。往嘗有水銀及碘劑。近更有砒素蒼鉛（鉍）劑。</p>
<p>關於黴毒之治療。就旣往歷史觀。吾國並不稍遜於歐西。蓋水銀劑之投與　已於周代見之矣。按周代醫學記載。每以輕粉治濕毒。其藥物之成分與治療之目標。適與水銀劑相符。他如箄薢，十茯苓之治徵瘡。亦與西洋史上治惡性微毒之Sassafras同其性質。惜以後人不之研究而未見進步耳。</p>
<p>二十世紀以還。特效藥之發明。層見疊出。然上述數種。依然不失其固有之價値。至於各藥之適應。有謂第一期當用砒素劑（Sal-v-arsan　606爲其代表）。第二期用水銀劑（注射者近已改用蒼鉛製劑。以其性質和平。少副作用）。第三期用碘劑者。然不可失之拘泥。其最妥善之方法。當推混合療法。（卽以砒素劑爲主以其他製劑爲輔）。蓋以兩種不同藥物。同時作用於病原菌時。其滅菌效力較單用尤爲顯著也。</p>
<p>微毒特效藥之使用。時期愈早。則效力愈顯。病變漸進。奏效减弱。故當初期硬結發見之頃。須早下確實之診斷。開始充分之治療。</p>
<p>再者。當藥劑投與之時。吾人更當設法避免藥物耐性（Arzneifest）之存在。所謂藥物耐性者。乃化學藥品作用於病原體時。以其藥量之不充分。使殘餘之病原體起對於該化學藥品之抵抗力。而致一一次投與時反失效之謂也。此化學耐性之存在。可傳至十代百代而無窮。是以黴毒療法不充分。非但不足以輕减其症狀。抑且增加病原菌對於該藥品之耐性。抑且使後之被毒者更陷於不堪收拾之地步矣。今觀社會情形。任何賣淫婦。任何染毒者。幾皆呈藥物耐性之狀態。是病患之所以不能滅。傳毒之所以日益廣也。</p>
<p>Hoftmann氏目擊此種危機。乃倡所謂極量療法。美國醫界。更有於一年間繼績用砒素及蒼鉛製劑注射。以圖完全驅毒之舉。足稱微毒治療界之異軍。近東西各國。已柑率傚用。卓著成效。至在吾國則一以科學智識之衰微。一以經濟能力之不及。難見實行。尙有待於吾人之督促。並冀病家之自省焉。</p>
<p>第八章　黴毒之預防問題</p>
<p>預防醫學佔二十仳紀醫學界中重要之一頁。微毒更不外此例。惟以微毒之預防。非如霍亂及傷寒之用預防疫苗。亦非如痳瘋之隔離。霍亂傷寒赤痢之淸潔飮食物等可比。蓋吾人旣知傳染黴毒之第一媒介爲性交。則欲達預防之目的。理想上當以禁絕性交爲最妥善。惜事實有所不能。是以黴毒之預防問題較其他傳染病爲尤難。茲姑就一般預防及個人預防分論之。</p>
<p>（甲）一般預防微毒之爲患。旣影響於社會國家。則一般預防。實爲至要。</p>
<p>子。　法律的强迫之制止A娼妓問題娼妓旣爲黴毒巢穴所在。故娼妓之處置。當屬預防上之要圖。因遂有倡</p>
<p>（一）廢娼廢娼雖爲預防微毒之簡當方法。但吾人如不設法安挿此被廢之娼妓。將使若輩流離飄泊。易公開而爲秘密。廢娼國（如美國）私娼之充斥。蓋有自也。</p>
<p>（二）公娼制度及檢黴運動此乃置警察監視之下。實行定期的檢查。有毒者禁止接客。無毒者準其行業。但淺表的不澈底之檢查。則毫無實效。如施嚴密之檢查。則可斷定所有娼妓將皆以有毒而被禁。更引起重大之社會問題。雖然。公娟及檢黴之實行。固不無缺陷可尋。但依據結計百分率確已顯著下降。似不失其價値。是可以倣效者。</p>
<h3>止痛的醫學（十九）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>人問到底怎樣止痛？合於病理　止痛法當首推水療熱力止痛法。此法可講是完全有益而無害的。此法卽熱濕布敷法。若用冷熱硫酸鎂飽相溶液更好。硫酸鎂液有消動止痛的效力，並且與身體完全無害。除硫酸鎂外水的熱力也是很重要。當加熱力時癰痕部的血管就張大。血管張大，患處緊張的情形就可鬆弛，疼痛因之也减少。加熱力後立時加以短時間冷敷，血管張大可以延長，功效可以持久。除了鬆弛作用外增加血流的速率又增加徘洩毒質功能，裨益也不算小。如敷以止痛藥膏或藥水也有相當好處。</p>
<p>第一點須注意的卽免除危險。我們曉得細菌很容易由癰疽入血。如果侵入血內便挽救困難，故於癰疽成熟時須將癰痕割去或尺割閉使膿與毒液由割口外流以减少侵入血的危險。至於疔瘡有人以爲是不可開刀的。此種主張算是有理，也可算是無理。講有理是疔瘡太晚時開刀也無濟事。講無理是長疔瘡的閒刀後死亡並不能算是開刀致病者於死，因不開刀病者也是要死的。據有名的外科家意見疔瘡宜較早開刀，因施行相當外科手術確可减低死亡率。如果太晚時外科手術旣不能挽救可以免行。</p>
<p>組織炎爲一種組織中急性散開發炎症。其原因爲毒細菌侵入皮肉致起膿化，或潰爛，或成壞疽。組織炎常起於腿部，或手部，或面部。起始常由一點破皮於短時間發炎散及全肢體，與所講，「星星之火可以燎原相似。致生此種病的常是鏈球菌。此種細菌一方面使局部起嚴重的急性發炎，一方面常侵入而　使患者於短時期內發生性命危險。</p>
<p>治療此種嚴重毛病與治療癰疽原理略同。在可能範圍內可以盡量止痛，但不可妄用麻醉品與內服止痛藥以减低病者抵抗力。挽救的急務是將腫爛處大大割開使毒液外流，同時敷傷紗布宜浸以濃液以吸取毒質。此時動用外科手術較有挽救希望。萬不可阻擾開刀以自絕一綫生機。</p>
<p>膿腫卽局部生膿。膿腫初起與癤相同不過較癤爲大。起初消腫止痛最好的方法爲水療冷熱濕布敷，其效用詳前。其次將腫部托起與休息常可免去化膿。如果想要避免生膿與開刀務忠實實行以上原則。這樣不但可以止痛並且還可以防痛於未然。若是已經成膿了，求最少的痛苦是開刀放膿。膿一放出痛就可减去十之八九。不開刀疼痛要多，疼痛要久，並且也有危險</p>
<p>痔痛</p>
<p>大腸的下端與肛門處是極其容易生毛病的。有毛病時每次大便就要痛，如果不醫治好疼痛可以纏綿十年二十年不愈。常人常講，（十人九痔，」言雖不免太過，但可見受痔瘡痛苦的不算少數。亦惟有眞正的科學醫學才能解除患者的痛苦。茲略述痔瘡的病理，預防方法，與止痛，治療方法以供讀者參考。痔有外痔內痔兩種。茲分別略述。</p>
<p>外痔中較平常的是血栓外痔，發現在肛門外，由黃豆大小到核桃大小不等。越大也越疼痛。生這種外痔的原因多爲咳嗽或用力震破肛門處靜脈管，致血流在皮下成血埤，此卽血栓痔。有時直腸下端之靜脈發炎亦成血栓痔。這種痔之特點是平素無痔而忽然間發現。這種外痔起始最痛是由於血塊的張力。痔大時無論行走坐臥都是疼痛難忍。</p>
<p>講北這種痛最有效最合理的方法是用一點局部麻藥將痔割開並且將血埤擠出，如此痛於短時間內就完全消除了。傷處全愈也不過是數日內之事。若是不採用此法而用姑息的治療法，如擦止痛藥，每日通大便，用冷熱法血埤漸漸亦可自行化去。不過如此行疼痛一定要延長一兩星期之久。有時中途亦可在痔處發生膿腫，因陳血塊中極易滋生細菌。若是成了瘡疼痛還要延長。注意外痔不可用注射法治療。此爲血栓外痔的大槪治法，患者自擇可也。</p>
<p>關於本症臨床上的症象，可特殊提出的並不很多；下痢最是一個很重要的症象，但有時也會發生便秘的。腹部陷沒，腹痛現象大半是缺如的，此外則發身貧血，脫力，贏瘦等，種種全身狀態；溫度增高也是很習見的，但是否由腸部抑或由肺部發生，則無從濫定。有時在下腹週盲腸部分，祇須經過觸症檢查手續，可以發現腫瘤存在的：這也是腸結核之一種，所謂迥盲腸結核是。他的經通大槪是很緩慢的；因爲此處腸部萎縮和硬受的關係，腸孔也因之狹窄異常的。此種型式，患者以靑春期間少年爲多，痊愈須經過外科手術方行的。糞便中結核菌之證明，並不能當作本症確據，這可以由嚥下的痰哩發生的。關於腸部光的檢查，對於腸結核的診斷方面之助力是很大的；這方面的詳細情形，除開專家外，當然是用不着如此淸楚的。</p>
<p>腸結核的治療，可分作兩方面：一爲食物節制療法，一爲藥物的療法。關於食物節制一方面，如果忠者發生便秘了，對於一切的輕瀉劑，都須愼用，最好多服水果及新鮮菜類。如果發生下痢症象了，那末，像白菜，莢豆，多脂肉類，以及冷飮科等種種，都應該禁服，至少的限度，也須减少至相當程度方行的。牛乳的內服，最好加入少許石灰水：咖啡亦須禁忌。腹部使溫暖，是有利舞弊的，所以太陽燈等種種療法，都是不無助力的。藥物的療法，以收歛劑爲最重要：像血於粉，白陶土，單寗酸諸劑，　劑，都是很適用的。鈣劑的長期注射，對於下痢症象也是很有裨益的。阿片劑的應用，係有止瀉止痛之功效的。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第四節　消化器官（續）</p>
<p>他的發生地方，以迥腸下部爲最多，大腸上部也是很習見的；在此處的腸粘膜上面，係發現潰爛狀態，並且有微小結節可認識的，所謂結核性滑瘍是。此種潰瘍，有時也可以因結痂而致痊愈的：但新的潰痬，大半曾在接近的地方繼續　生的。</p>

<h3>我國中等教育狀況</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>我國教育的不發達，這是一個顯明的事實。據最近教育部的統計，我國全國中等教育的人數，在每萬人中，只有十二人，和世界主要各國比較，佔第二十六位。則我國教育的落后，可想而知。</p>
<p>全世界各文明國，小學教育，是一種強迫教育。凡國內兒童，一達學齡，都有受小學教育的義務。不但如是，聽說有些國家，卽中等教育，亦旅行一種強迫制度。但在我國，不要說是中等教育，就是小學教育，雖表面上也訂為一種義務教育，然實際上全國學齡兒童之得受小學教育者，為數亦甚少。</p>
<p>但據事實而論，中等教育，亦應列為一種義務教育。蓋在現今這種複雜的社會環境裏面，一個青年要能夠用自己的確能力去對付，單受幾年的小學教育，實在還是不足的。然在今日的我國教育情狀之下，要希望中等教育施行強迫，這是無論如何做不到的。但是設法使中等教育日漸普及，當是一個不可忽視的問題。</p>
<p>按我國中等教育的不發達，原因甚多。例如教育經費的貧乏，教育人材的缺少，人民受中等教育力量的薄弱等都是。還有一個原因，就是小學教育不普及使然。救濟之道，自應從各方面去下手改良。</p>
<h3>隨筆之一</h3>
<p>— 小鶯</p>
<p>在近來，似乎又有點復古的趨向了，於是，許多人的心目中，翻起了過往的影象。</p>
<p>自然，牠的價值是因了各人的觀感的不同而發生了互異的評價，究竟這評價是真切的或是虛偽的？這，好像還沒有肯確的論斷。也許就是因為復古的熱情吧？不，與其說復古的熱情，不如說神權的伸張來得切當，在這底下，不知怎麼，近來的人對於神的信仰又顯着格外的濃厚，是的，「神」能支配着人的心靈，「神」能賜福，或降災，「神」也能滿足了不同的人的心裏所懷戀的不同的企望。</p>
<p>每一個人，只要不是在機構上有了缺欠，自然都有一種企求，這企求，有的僅限於現時，有的則超越現實而達到不可捉摸的玄想，這樣，燒香或拜佛，使應時的乘勢而興。這樣說，也許是有點語病，因為燒香和拜佛已有着牠悠久的史實，并不是現實的突見，不過，基於精神的得不到寄托，而使這形態更加普遍了。</p>
<p>在最近，從蕭山的來人口中，得到了一個消息，說是由紹興開往蕭山岳廟的番般一艘，在走過遵義橋的時候，忽</p>

<p>遇盜匪數人，嚇令停駛，遂卽上船大肆搜刦，所有男女老幼香客共三十幾人，都被一一搜查，無一倖免，但結果因銀數無多，又把各香客的衣服盡行剝去，損失共計有二百多元之譜。</p>
<p>在上面的消息裏，使我們得到了一個感念，所謂神權，所謂靈騐，那不過只是騙人的把戲而已，倘若不然，那挾着無限的熱誠，遼遠的前往進香的男女，總不應該獲得了如此的沒趣吧！</p>
<h3>張鄉董</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>院子里兩株高大的桂樹，在初秋季節已開放了滿枝金花，但是氣候像大伏中一般地酷熱，墻外的過路人時常在墻脚邊歇脚，那馥郁的香味使他們的官覺發生一種莫明其妙的舒適，更有依着墻寬心地打起磕睡來的。附近的孩子們，更愛戀這些細小的花朶，但是張老爺在本鎭上的威名使他們不敢撤野地要求大人們去討取，往往冒着危險從墻角上爬進來私自攀折。</p>
<p>面着這院子的是張老爺的臥室，他每天抽足了大烟，挾着他太太的婢女秋香，故意匿在窗幃的背面，觀望高墻上孩子們偷竊的態度引爲樂趣的。秋香更是能够猜測老爺心理的伶俐孩子，張老爺的日子自然過得再舒服沒有的了。</p>
<p>他的大太太是位賢德的夫人，過門十年多後有生得一男半女，她以爲女人家沒有盡生男育女的責任是對不住丈夫的：並且懷疑自己前世做了寃孽的事，以致今世沒有子息。她將這意思告訴了老爺，一面就鳩工在宅旁建了一所佛堂，勸老爺把自己陪嫁的婢女收了房，就長齋古佛修她下一世的福份了。</p>
<p>張老爺對着秋香早存了非分之想，碍於妻子的眼睛，暗中偷偷摸摸亦非一次了。現在奉了太太的命令，他把後院的書房粉飾一新，院子里遍種了四季花草，每天把自己關在臥房中過日子。然而也是本鎭上的鄉董，他的事情和進欵是同樣地纏擾着的。從前時候，他每天午後上茶館去，那里幾乎是他的衙門，因爲茶客到這時候已經全數走了，每個人綳起了難看的臉鵠候在那里的，就都是張老爺的主顧了。他們從銀錢的出入到逆倫大案都要憑張老爺的一句話而定奪是非。並且他的評言就是法律，誰都不敢哼半個不字的。，况且張老爺月己說過他是淸官，從來沒有寃曲過人，這一點張老爺的威名和進欵同時霸了本鎭的最高權。</p>
<p>自從他獲得工秋香，他把這重大的責任委之於他心腹隨從張二爺。張二爺原來的名字呌阿狗，是張老爺的佃戶。據說他有個漂亮的老婆，被張老爺姦後含羞自盡，阿狗才做了張老爺的隨從。但是阿狗有一張靈活的嘴，一顆玲瓏的心，他並懷恨張老爺逼死他的老婆，反處處凑着主人的意思無惡不作，於是張二爺的名嚮了起來。其實這是旁人咒駡他是張老爺的兒子的用意，阿狗沒有這般想得週到，聽到「張二爺」三字就把鼻子眉毛并了家，巴給他的主人張老爺自然更進一層。</p>
<p>這幾天太太害病，秋香進佛堂去了。阿狗就老是打等在老爺房里，爲了解除老爺的寂寞，他打出一個主意，這主意把老爺從烟舖上彈簧一般地跳了起來</p>
<p>已經日落西山了，張老爺抽了過量的大姻，還是遍體不舒服。院子里的桂花，像一個妖媚的女人似的誘惑着他爺「要命，這時候還不回來！」他右手握了拳頭，打着自家的左手，慢慢地踱到　前來，不料一個矮身材的影春門側敲了個滿懷。</p>
<p>「老爺、阿狗該死！」張二爺的身材是顯得更矮小了。</p>
<p>「這末鬼鬼祟祟的！」老爺是笑着說的：「成功了沒有？」就旋回身來向烟舖踱去，阿狗就一個彩子般的跟蹤上前。</p>
<p>「老爺恭喜你　我費了半天的嘴舌　軟功硬功……哈哈」馬上壓低了嗓子附到老爺的肩頭上，「現在小的家里…</p>
<p>「辛苦你了，阿狗！」老爺一下了把他推到烟鋪上，「香一口罷！」一邊打着哈哈，摸着上唇的鬚子在室內打旋起來</p>
<h3>有飯吃的時候</h3>

<h3>大笨珍</h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>這兒祇有一條修長寬闊的馬路，在南國，灼熱的陽光晒射底下，彷彿呈着極度困倦的狀態，屏了氣息靜靜地躺着；一陣風掠過，地面上陡然地翻騰起滾滾的沙塵的波浪，迷迷濛濛的像北國冬天刮風的時候的黃沙塵一樣，使人們的眼睛怪難受的。笨珍河終年泛着桃紅色的江水，微微地掀起了灧灧的波紋，彷彿一床疊錦般的，蜿蜒曲折悠悠地流着，橫過這修長的馬路，交織成一個十字形。河上，架着一座高大的木橋，把馬路貫通着，讓汽車，貨車軋軋地在橋上行走，那笨重的貨車發出來的隆隆的音響，在恬靜的午後，時時會把人們從香甜的夢里驚醒過來，睜大了惺忪的睡眼，瞧望着烈日炎炎的靑天，而疑心這是暴風雨前的市鳴了。</p>
<p>當幾年前從大笨珍直往新加坡的汽車路還沒有築成功的時候，這里有常川的小汽船，往來於新加坡之間，一切的貨物的運輸，全賴這桃紅色綺麗幽美的笨珍河，如今，陸上的交通已經完成了，小汽船頓失去它的原有的地位和勢力，以至被淘汰了，祗存江上那小小的碼頭，還孤另另地屹立着，像不服氣似的，對着高大的木橋很很地側視睥睨着。</p>
<p>由大笨珍的外表上看起來，簡直不成爲一個商埠，沒有巨天的烟囱，吐出輕飄縷縷而又　　的　　　：重沒有　天雄　的建築物；就連眨者　　　　　牒的電燈也是沒有的：　　　　　他的娛樂塲所，那更是不必說了。這兒，祗有這唯一的修長泥土飛揚的馬路，在沿河橘的那一段，點綴着百幾十間低矮簡陋的亞答屋，那便是僑胞們集中買賣的地方，凑成這個小小的「山巴」「村野」市鎭。</p>
<p>大笨珍除了這百幾十家的商店之外，週遭都種植着一望無際廣大高聳的檳榔和膠樹，靑葱得像浩浩的碧海，整齊齊地兀立着。這樹膠和檳榔，是他們每年的主要的出產品，同時也是搆成這小市鎭的商業繁榮的生命綫，然而，頻年來的膠情的慘跌，淸淡，和檳榔的歉收，使這小市鎭的商業，更加簫條零落了！</p>
<p>大笨珍的土人，可以說完全受僑胞們的同化，粗野的蠻性一點也沒有存留着，風俗古樸，對人也極熱情，眞摯，且富有禮讓之風，大有文明國人的風度。</p>
<p>每當淸夜，萬籟俱寂的時侯，我總喜歡獨個兒拖着木展，篤篤地走上笨珍河的木橋上，憑着欄桿，欣賞中天滿圈的圓亮，數着品螢閃爍的星星，而懷念起萬里遙隔的故鄉來，或望望江上兩旁的叢莽的幽影，與羽毛般的輕快的漁舟，在橋下往來穿梭着，欵乃乃的，一回兒便烟也似地消逝了。</p>
<p>有時，當悽厲悠怨的馬來樂和着斷腸的柔歌，斷斷續續地從遠處的遊船裏傅送過來，那悲愴的情調，繚繞在我的耳朶裏彈動我的心弦，時時會勾引起我的心窩裏的悽凉的情緒來，而涔涔地籟着傷心的酸淚！</p>
<p>然而，大笨珍的那綺麗清美的古鎭般的靜謐的幽情，這時迥憶起來又使我不勝春戀神往了。</p>

<h3>沈西苓之第三創作「鄉愁」</h3>
<p>遠遠的東北，高債蘋的美消的家庭，被確火擊得骨肉流離，她帶着她年老的母親和一個神經質的傴背的僕人，飄流到上海來，紙醉金述，坐歌徹夜，上海的繁華依舊，他們一面受着生活的壓迫，一面看着滿眼醉生夢死的行屍走肉，一片鄉愁引起了高債蘋無限的悲憤。其後，她歷盡滄桑，終算解決了生活問題，可是上海也非安居樂業之處，她又遇到第二次的變亂了。</p>
<p>「鄉愁」很嚴重的告訴我們，要是我們每個人，都是這麼醉生夢死的，糊裏糊塗的生活下去，那麼每個人都隨時隨地的有失却家的危險</p>
<p>這是沈西苓的第三創作，在鄉愁中，他以詩人的强烈的正義情感，寄托了他無限的故國哀思。</p>

<h3>The Chahar Incident Has Been Resolved: Both Parties Have Reached an Understanding After Negotiations; Qin Dechun Still Remains in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Zhangbei incident has been resolved satisfactorily. It is reported that there was a twist in the negotiations, but after Qin Dechun and Matsui continued to mediate in Tianjin, they obtained the consent of the Japanese Kwantung Army. Qin is scheduled to come to Beiping on the 17th after completing his affairs in Tianjin and then return to Zhangbei to report his mission. (Sixteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun has been conducting negotiations in Beiping and Tianjin for several consecutive days regarding the Zhangbei incident. As a result, both China and Japan have reached an understanding, and the incident has been completely resolved.

<h3>Judicial Yuan Explains Doubts Regarding the Petition Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan recently explained doubts regarding the Petition Law as follows: (1) Retired civil servants, regarding the amount and method of pension payments, are established according to the Civil Servant Pension Regulations for the special status of civil servants, and are actually public law rights. Therefore, after their request is rejected by the original office, regardless of whether they have suffered losses, they may not file a petition in accordance with Article 1 of the Petition Law. (2) When the government office accepting the petition believes that the petition is without reason, its decision should use the words "reject" or "repel." Although this is not explicitly stipulated in the Petition Law, in order to unify legal terminology, the word "reject" should be used in accordance with Article 8 of the same law.

<h3>Economic Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>If China does not seek self-sufficiency, it will be impossible to ensure China's survival. However, while self-sufficiency is what our hearts desire, it is as difficult as ascending to heaven. This is not just because a planned economy is not easily realized at once. Even if it is realized, will those with hawkish eyes allow China to proceed leisurely without hindering or sabotaging it? Those who discuss economics, for the sake of developing the country's agriculture, industry, and commerce, do not just advocate increasing production to be self-sufficient but also to supply others, and to slightly reduce the outflow of foreign goods. They also advocate raising tariffs to protect the people and thus protect the country, and to temporarily resist the raging tide that has already collapsed. These theories have a deep and long history in economics, but under China's current circumstances, what is the actual situation? One cannot but give considerable thought to this. Taking the current situation as an example, in terms of agriculture, ten yuan per dan of silkworm cocoons, regardless of the cost of mulberry leaves, those raising silkworms calculate their income, which is probably even less than a Shanghai maid's monthly wage. Soybean and wheat harvests have been abundant and poor, but the selling price is difficult to exchange for three dou of rice per dan. Looking back at the soybeans transported from Dalian, they are still depreciating and encroaching on the market. Rice and wheat from across the ocean are still coming in continuously. Agricultural products, regardless of whether the harvest is abundant or poor, are all worthless, while nearly 70% of the daily necessities of farmers are foreign goods. How can the countryside not go bankrupt, and how can the cities not collapse? In terms of industry, to say something heartbreaking, almost everything seen in the market is a processed product made from foreign goods, or a product of foreign-owned factories within our country. Since tariffs were raised, many goods are imported from foreign countries as materials and assembled locally. Those who are unaware think that these so-called "Made in Shanghai" products must be domestic goods, but how can they know that they are foreign goods disguised to deceive people? As for heavy industry, it is even less to be discussed. If there is any, it is either jointly operated with foreigners or solely operated by foreigners. Light industry is occasionally started, but it is often subjected to foreign exclusion. Very few can stand on their own. Looking to the future, I want to seek self-sufficiency, but people do not allow me to be self-sufficient. What can I do?</p>
<p>As for tariff protection, it is effective in all countries, but in our country, tax evasion and smuggling are often heard of, and even armed transport disregards public opinion. Under this kind of situation, it is even more difficult to find an effective solution. Our products still have various domestic taxes. Now, they are in the same market as goods that are imported by evading taxes. Their failure can be expected. However, we should not allow people to invade our markets and control our profit sources because of the overwhelming difficulties, and not know how to seek survival. Calamities often build a nation. This is precisely the best time to test whether our nation can overcome this difficult situation.</p>
<p>Recently, the British government has dispatched Mr. Ross as the economic advisor to the British Ambassador to China to investigate, in order to revive our country's economy, especially focusing on monetary issues. France has also dispatched Mr. Renault-Xi, an expert on international monetary issues, to come to China together. According to a Reuter's dispatch from London on the 11th, when representatives from various countries studied China's monetary issues, they will maintain the silver standard used domestically, but negotiate a new method for foreign use. Generally, each country is based on its own technical standpoint. That is, Britain advocates that China's foreign currency should be linked to the pound, France advocates that it should be linked to gold, and the United States will require it to be linked to the dollar. What they say is difficult to believe before the various countries have expressed their opinions. However, since each has its own opinions, and there are conflicting interests, it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain good results. Moreover, there are still other obstacles. In short, when foreigners plan for China, they are planning for themselves, which is the norm of human nature. For example, Britain has huge railway claims in China, and China is also its major customer in Manchester. It cannot ignore the risk of its interests being damaged. However, we must always seek our own survival and not be dependent on others and be dominated by others. For example, the currency system has no reason to remain unchanged for a long time, but its change should always be based on our own standpoint, seeking less harm and more benefit, and lasting and feasible. If it is a temporary measure, regardless of the harm later, thinking that it is needed today and using it, and abandoning it tomorrow when it is not needed, I am afraid that it will not be so easy. Even if it is possible, the chaos and damage suffered by the general public would be unbearable. If it is like this, then why not declare to people that they should abandon their silver purchase policy? We know that it is ineffective, but it will not cause malpractices.</p>
<p>I believe that in this dangerous situation, to seek survival in the slightest chance, we can only do our best and plan for the overall situation. As for the differences in academic propositions, there seems to be no need to haggle over them. The ancients finished their discussions and the troops had already crossed the river. This can be a lesson for us. For example, the Shanghai financial incident was not without shocking waves and extreme danger. However, as a result of the joint efforts of all parties, it turned from danger to safety. Today, the financial organization has undergone many changes. If the effectiveness of the collection, concentration, and unification can be used well and gradually developed, how can we know that this panic will not turn into a better new situation?</p>
<p>In short, the key to improving China's economy lies in self-reliance. Others can plan for me, but I can only carefully choose among them. I can never accept it as a whole. However, how can we achieve self-reliance? This is what I hope that scholars and experts will exhaust their wisdom to study.</p>
<h3>China at a Critical Juncture of Survival, National Unity is the First Priority, Sir Frederick Whyte Publishes an Article</h3>
<p>(London) The Observer today published an article by Sir Frederick Whyte, former political advisor to the Chinese government, stating that China is currently in a critical period of survival, independently supporting the precarious situation. Forty years ago, the five major powers were jealous of each other and did not want any one country to excessively expand its power, so China was able to escape being divided. However, today, only one country is rampant in the Far East. China can only rely on its own passive resistance and national unity. Far-sighted Chinese should be aware of this difficult period and resolve to reorganize their internal affairs, cultivate and strengthen their national strength, and seek revival.

<h3>Moscow Newspaper Discusses the International Situation</h3>
<p>(Moscow) An editorial in the Moscow Daily stated, "Since the end of the Great War and the establishment of the League of Nations, the world has never had such a wide range of choices between various methods of international relations, in policies leading to war and policies preserving peace. Collective security guarantees and joint action by the powers against aggressor nations are the fundamental ideas of the League of Nations. This has been clearly stated in Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>However, facts have proven that the realization of this principle has repeatedly encountered serious difficulties. Therefore, the theory and implementation of the League of Nations must be limited, and the collective security guarantee realized through local conventions has become a continuation of the League of Nations' ideas. This limitation of ideas has been explained by life itself.</p>
<p>Indeed, countries that clearly understand the limitations of the path to peace will not abandon their aggression plans. When this guiding limitation begins to be realized, or when that guiding accelerates its aggression preparations, these countries will also begin to withdraw from the League of Nations. Their withdrawal from the League of Nations actually contains the meaning of attempting to destroy the collective security guarantee system.</p>
<p>Hitler's theory of localizing war is only a declaration to disperse world thought, and has the same meaning as admitting that aggression is not a crime. At this time, the whole world can see where Hitler's theory will lead.</p>
<p>China is the first victim of these League of Nations opponents and believers in the idea of localizing war. Japan, because it is considered innocent, can continue to invade China again and again, seeking to complete its ambition to destroy China's independence.</p>
<p>We are now seeing an ugly phenomenon: although the powers have also witnessed the path to peace and their own interests being repeatedly attacked, they have failed to achieve anything because they cannot unite and there is no agreement on how to deal with these events.</p>
<p>Hitler's idea of localizing war has long been adopted by Japan. Germany is still advocating it, but this is only because Germany of the National Socialist Party has not yet completed its military expansion and therefore feels that its strength is insufficient, so it can only temporarily not implement it.</p>
<p>"If European countries do not unite in time to prevent it, there will be such a day. If the only purpose of the Czech Foreign Minister's visit is to provide new proof of this truth, then its purpose has been achieved. We firmly believe that Pi's visit will be praised throughout Europe, except by those countries that believe in the localization of the German-Japanese war." (16th, TASS telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Minister of the Army Returns to Country Talks About Japanese-Russian Conflict Crisis Not Gone Admits Northeast Volunteer Army Forces Strong Not Easy to Eliminate Advocates Large-Scale Immigration to Manchuria Military Expenditure Cannot be Reduced</h3>
<p>(Shimonoseki) Minister of the Army Hayashi, along with aides such as Nagata and Yokomizo, arrived here at 7:30 PM on the 15th, and boarded a special express train at 8:30 PM to head east. He is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo at 3:25 PM on the 16th. According to his remarks in Shimonoseki:</p>
<p>The Kwantung Army, with the Commander of the South as the center, is far from home. Without any complete equipment and without being comforted, its officers and soldiers are in a difficult situation, but they do not show any dissatisfaction and are able to serve with all their strength, which is really admirable. Although the major motive for war between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" has not yet been discovered, it is easy to create a motive for conflict, which is extremely important to pay attention to. Regarding maintaining治安, the Japanese and Manchurian armies should make every effort to plan it. It seems difficult to eliminate "bandits" in the short term. There are still many undeveloped places in Manchuria, so development is necessary for both Japan's population problem and the industrial development of "Manchukuo." Therefore, large-scale immigration must be carried out based on the national policy. The abolition of extraterritoriality is now in preparation, and the decision has been made to start with the abolition of taxation rights. The general method will be implemented by the end of "Kangde" Year Four. (16th, Japanese United News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Vice Minister Miyahara Hashimoto greeted the Minister of the Army at Shizuoka Station at 0:37 PM on the 16th. On the train, he reported to the Minister of the Army all the circumstances during his trip to Manchuria, especially the attitude taken by the Army Central Department on the North China issue, the decisions of the Cabinet Deliberation Council, and other details. He also held important consultations regarding the Army Ministry's policy towards the Second Cabinet Deliberation Council on the 17th, and the North China issue, the Chahar issue, etc. (16th, Japanese Telegraph News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota originally hoped to visit Manchuria for inspection, and because Counselor Tani and Minister of the Army Hayashi and others frequently persuaded the Foreign Minister to go to Manchuria, he has decided to go to Manchuria for inspection. Moreover, because there are many urgent issues such as the abolition of extraterritoriality and the establishment of additional consulates, and the disarmament preparatory negotiations will be held this autumn, the Foreign Minister's visit to Manchuria will be around August or September. At that time, Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira and Ambassador to Germany Mushakoji will also return to the country, or they will visit Manchuria together with the ambassadors.

<h3>Under the Iron Heel of the Japanese, Andong People Cannot Make a Living, 500,000 People Have Difficulty Maintaining Life, Suicides and Crimes are Endless</h3>
<p>A Hua Lian News Agency dispatch from Andong reports that the Dongbian Road area, centered on Andong, has been suffering for years, and the people are in dire straits. In areas such as Hama Tang, Wulonggu, Stone City, Ji'an, Linjiang, Changbai, Sandaolangtou, Hunshuipao, Dadonggou, Dagushan, and Zhuanghe, there are currently 540,000 poor people on the verge of starvation. Because they cannot make a living, 5,000 people have moved to other places, 145 people have committed crimes due to poverty, and the most tragic thing is that recently there have been 55 suicide victims. 280 people sold all their forest properties to maintain their livelihoods, and 724 people sold their children as prostitutes. The people have complaints but no way to appeal, which is the extreme tragedy of life.</p>
<h3>Threat to Pacific Security, Netherlands and Portugal Prepare for the Future, Intensify Naval Construction</h3>
<p>Chicago News According to a London communication published in the Chicago Sunday Tribune, since Japan broke the London Naval Treaty and declared that after announcing the abolition of the Washington Treaty, it would build the navy it deemed necessary for its security in the Pacific, the relationship between the United States and Britain has been forced to become closer than ever before on Pacific affairs. In addition to Britain and the United States, Japan has also forced the Netherlands and Portugal to join the picture of the Pacific situation. The Netherlands and the two countries, which have not been regarded as important naval countries for generations, will now appear on the stage to maintain the white power in the Pacific. The Netherlands, at the beginning of Japan's invasion of the Pacific, was worried about the security of its Pacific colonies. Moreover, in Europe, it also felt that if one of Germany and France wanted to annex its territory, it would also be unable to defend itself. Therefore, its policy has always been to rely on a country without conflicts of interest, or a country with the same interests in the Pacific and Europe, that is, Britain.</p>
<p>Before the expiration of the Washington Treaty, Britain could not increase its navy, and Portugal was not a party to the Washington Treaty, so it was free to build warships. Portugal has now started building ships, which are built by British shipyards, and they are fast light cruisers, which are extremely suitable for the Far East archipelago. Is this a coincidence? However, the fact that these new ships will be used in the Pacific is an undisputed fact. After all, Portugal is also an important Pacific country, and it has at least the same reasons as the Netherlands to fear Japanese invasion. Therefore, it is now carrying out defensive works in Macau, and its plan includes a dock that can accommodate large ships that the Portuguese Navy does not currently have. (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>British Eden and Air Minister Give Speeches on Security and Peace Reinforce Military Equipment to Prevent War</h3>
<p>(London) Cabinet Minister Eden recently gave a speech in Warwickshire, saying, "Based on the experience we have gained, the arms race is not the way to build peace, but any country that feels insecure will inevitably reorganize its military. No one can stop it. As far as I know, there is only one way to security, that is, all countries clearly express their willingness to do their best to maintain international order, so that trust can be generated. My personal view of the collective deduction level system is like this, so I advocate that the United Kingdom must protect the League of Nations with all its strength, because the League of Nations is the only representative of collective peace." (15th, Havas telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Aviation Minister Sir Reesdale gave a speech in Chiddingstone, Medway district today, saying, "Preventing war with sufficient military force is the most effective method. Britain's expansion of its air force is to prevent war, not caused by panic. Regarding the maintenance of national security, the government has an unshirkable responsibility and will do its best. Moreover, it should go further and make efforts to establish a sky treaty to limit armaments, in order to maintain mutual security and general peace. But to achieve this goal, we must have sufficient military force and a strong military organization." (15th, Havas telegram)</p>
<h3>Naval Issues: Anglo-German Talks Proceed Smoothly; Germany Submits Draft Shipbuilding Program; Italy and France's Replies Imminent</h3>
<p>(Paris) The German delegation continued its meeting with British naval experts at the Admiralty today. They presented a draft of the German shipbuilding program, which is said to be entirely based on the American plan. The British plan, after any general compromise, can still be amended. Meanwhile, France is evidently anxious about the progress of the Anglo-German naval talks. Newspapers today stated that the British government is determined to tear up the naval clauses of the Treaty of Versailles without much hesitation, but France will never agree to Germany having a tonnage equal to 35% of British ships. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers unanimously predict the success of the naval conference. It is reported that the British government has allowed Germany's request for 35%, and the talks are proceeding on this basis. Evening newspapers predict that the two sides can agree. The newspaper said that the German leader Hitler clearly understands the need for British naval superiority. If other continental countries increase their naval power, then Britain will naturally follow suit, and Germany, according to the Anglo-German agreement, can also increase proportionally. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The Anglo-German naval talks will continue from tomorrow, lasting about a week. An agreement in principle has been reached regarding the British request that a 25% ratio be applied to all classes of warships. However, it is generally believed that Britain is unwilling to take any binding action before clarifying the replies from the French and Italian governments. The replies from France and Italy are expected to arrive around Tuesday, and their content and wording will be the same. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Content of Germany's Shipbuilding Plan</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that Britain is about to ask France to send a delegation here to discuss the Anglo-German agreement on naval issues. This agreement has not yet been finalized, but Germany has reportedly promised not to build battleships of more than 35,000 tons. The country's naval shipbuilding plan includes five battleships, each with a displacement limited to 22,000 tons, with guns of 11 to 12 inches in caliber. The country will also follow the "Deutschland" class of pocket battleships and build six heavy cruisers of 8,000 or 10,000 tons, but the exact displacement of these warships has not yet been determined. In addition, it plans to build 36 destroyers of 1,000 tons, 18 submarines of 400 tons, and two aircraft carriers of 22,000 tons. Britain wants these to be completed gradually over a considerable number of years, so that the country can calmly replace its old warships. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Anglo-German Naval Agreement Difficult for France to Accept</p>
<p>(Paris) The imminent conclusion of a naval agreement between Britain and Germany in London has caused widespread indignation here. Newspapers believe that the German naval tonnage being equal to 35% of the British navy is unacceptable to France. Le Petit Parisien said that Italy now intends to consult with France before submitting a reply to Britain, as the path it can follow must at least be perfectly aligned with France. The Socialist Party's newspaper Le Populaire also holds the same view. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Avoiding Competition is Beneficial to Britain</p>
<p>(London) The Anglo-German naval agreement is likely to be successfully concluded. Because Germany bears a heavy burden of rearming its army and air force, building a navy at a rate of 35% compared to Britain would make it even more difficult to raise funds. It is unlikely to have extravagant hopes beyond this ratio. The British side believes that the Anglo-German naval agreement is practically beneficial in that: (1) Britain and Germany will not repeat the mistakes of before 1914 and engage in naval competition; (2) Germany recognizes that Britain's naval forces in the North Sea should be superior to Germany. In addition, the general situation can also be eased after the agreement is concluded, because Germany's military has fully restored its sovereignty and can participate in the collective security system, and the future naval conference is also expected to be held as scheduled. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Army and Air Force Armaments Should Not Be Mixed</p>
<p>(London) France has raised objections to the Anglo-German naval agreement allowing Germany 35% of British tonnage, saying that if the Soviet Union increases its naval forces in the future, Germany may use this as an excuse to change this ratio. It also said that the principle of interdependence between army, navy, and air force armaments has been repeatedly proposed at disarmament conferences and seems applicable to naval issues, and that a treaty similar to the Locarno Treaty of the Skies could also be drawn up regarding naval issues. British naval figures have recently criticized this objection, saying that the 35% ratio is a fixed figure and there is no room for change. As for the principle of interdependence between army, navy, and air force armaments, it is not applicable to the navy, as the Washington Naval Treaty and the negotiations currently underway regarding the establishment of the Locarno Treaty of the Skies are two completely different matters and should not be confused.

<h3>German Explosives Factory: Speculation on the Cause of the Explosion; Caused by Careless Testing of Poison Gas</h3>
<p>Belgium Several Belgian chemists are meeting in Liège, Belgium. One of the chemists recently told a "Daily" reporter that "most of the chemists meeting here agree that the cause of the explosion at the Rhein Metall-Dorf explosives factory was due to careless testing of a type of poison gas in the factory's chemical laboratory. As for what this poison gas is, we are still investigating, but we predict that if used in wartime, it will have extremely terrible effects. This poison gas emits a thick yellow smoke, and users must wear gas masks. In short, this incident proves that Germany is preparing for war." (Havas, 15th)</p>

<h3>Tragedy of Nighttime Train Collision in London Suburbs: 15 Dead, 30 Injured</h3>
<p>(London) A train collision occurred in Hertfordshire, England last night, killing fourteen people. According to eyewitnesses, a passenger express had just left the station and entered the main track when a mail express speeding from behind collided with the passenger train, resulting in the most tragic accident in Britain in several years. At the time, the passenger train's speed was about 20 miles per hour, while the mail train's speed was about 70 miles per hour, so the impact was extremely violent, and the passenger train was completely destroyed. Among the dead were five women and two young children. About 30 people were injured, with varying degrees of severity. Doctors and nurses rushed to help, but due to the darkness of the night, rescue was difficult. Although they worked overnight, the damaged vehicles were still blocking the tracks at 11 am this morning, so trains had to take a detour. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>East Africa Could Go to War Any Day: Blockade of Suez Canal; British Public Opinion Leans Towards This; Italian Newspaper Responds with Convention</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a rumor that a certain country intends to block the Suez Canal at any time to prevent war in East Africa. This rumor is not worth refuting, because the Suez Canal is for international public use and is guaranteed by the Constantinople Convention of October 29, 1888. Italy also signed this convention. Article 1 states that the Suez Canal shall be freely accessible to merchant ships or warships of any country, whether in times of peace or war. Therefore, there is no reason to block this canal under international law. This provision cannot be unilaterally changed by any country. If such a threat occurs, according to Article 8 of the convention, this issue should also be submitted to the signatory countries for joint discussion. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

Can Britain prevent Italian aircraft from crossing Egyptian territory? Can Britain block the Suez Canal to prevent Italian warships from entering and leaving? Can Britain assist Egypt and the Lake Tana region of Abyssinia, which obtains water from the Nile? (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>British Newspapers Advocate: Invoking the League of Nations Covenant</p>
<p>Regarding the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, some British newspapers have proposed that if Italy and Abyssinia go to war, Britain should invoke Article 20 of the League of Nations Covenant to blockade the Suez Canal as a means of sanctioning Italy. (Note: Article 20, Paragraph 2 of the League of Nations Covenant states that if a member of the League has obligations undertaken before joining the League that conflict with the articles of the Covenant, it shall immediately take steps to be freed from these obligations.) The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia recently discussed this issue and responded, saying, "If the Suez Canal, and by extension, all straits and navigable waterways, can be used as a tool for the League of Nations to sanction member states, just as an international air force should be used as a tool for sanctions, then the current straits system must be substantially revised and replaced with a new system, endowed with an international character, and the privileges currently enjoyed by certain countries must be abolished." (Note: Turkey's request to remilitarize the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits is most opposed by Britain. This statement in the Italian newspaper is probably referring to this.) (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>On the Italo-Ethiopian Dispute: The British Government's Attitude; The League of Nations Cannot Be Relied Upon; The Manchurian Incident Serves as a Warning; Unwilling to Hurt the Mouse for Fear of Breaking the Vase, Driving Italy into Germany's Arms; Sir Samuel Hoare's Diplomacy is Gentle, Still Intending to Act as a Mediator</h3>
<p>The British attitude towards the Abyssinian issue should be studied from two aspects: one is the relationship with the League of Nations, and the other is the relationship with the interests of Abyssinia and Britain itself. From the perspective of the League of Nations, Britain has always believed that since Abyssinia is a member state of the League of Nations, it should enjoy all the rights of the League of Nations enjoyed by other member states, and that receiving assistance from other member states when its territory is invaded is also one of its rights. Therefore, when the Emperor of Abyssinia applied to the League of Nations on May 20 to resolve the Walwal incident and delineate the Italo-Ethiopian border through peaceful means, Britain made every effort to avoid war and endeavored to promote the organization of an arbitration committee to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Indeed, due to the firm attitude of the British representative Eden, Italy finally accepted the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council on May 25. Afterwards, Eden returned to his country, and the newspapers praised him greatly, saying that Eden was the reason for the League of Nations' victory in resolving the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. As a result, Eden's hopes of becoming Foreign Secretary steadily increased. Unexpectedly, the cabinet was reorganized on June 9, and the post of Foreign Secretary was given to the Secretary of State for India, Sir Samuel Hoare. One reason for this was that Eden was too young, but in the observation of political figures, it was said that Eden's overly tough attitude in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute was also a major reason why he could not succeed as Foreign Secretary. Recently, incidents have occurred again on the border between Italian territory and Abyssinia, and Italy has once again spoken eloquently, saying that it must take new measures to avoid creating a new situation. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini also delivered a speech, saying that "Italy has the need to solve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute on its own and will not be concerned about anything." It can be seen that Italy's attitude is very clear. The governments of various European countries know that if they still use the League of Nations as a shield to prevent Italy from taking action against Abyssinia, then Italy will certainly retaliate by withdrawing from the League. Subsequently, Italian newspapers criticized Britain with fierce rhetoric, and the Italian government vaguely revealed its intention to approach Berlin. Under these circumstances, the British government knows that if it invokes Articles 15 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to impose sanctions on Italy, the League of Nations will be facing a second Manchurian Incident, and the one emulating Japan will be a European country, so the situation will be more serious than the Manchurian Incident. As a result, Italy and Germany may compromise with each other, divide Austria, and completely change the European diplomatic situation, and a group opposed to the League of Nations will be established, and there is no danger greater than this. British political figures therefore observed that the policy of the new Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare must be more gentle. The recent sudden cessation of attacks on Britain by Italian newspapers must be related to Sir Samuel Hoare's gentle diplomacy. In addition, there is another matter that is quite noteworthy. Recently, it has been reported that the United Kingdom, France and Italy, signatories to the 1906 Abyssinia Treaty, will act jointly to transfer Abyssinia's important economic rights to Italy and build railways in Abyssinian territory to connect with the Italian territory of Somaliland as a condition for Italy to stop military action. This tentative proposal was issued by London. Although the Italian government denied it, it did not absolutely reject it. From this, it can be seen that it is not impossible for the United Kingdom, France and Italy to conduct secret negotiations with Abyssinia soon to satisfy Italy. Re-examine Britain's own interests. Britain has significant interests in the interior of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan based on various treaties prior to 1906, and there is no reason to give up these. Later, the United Kingdom, France and Italy concluded the 1906 Abyssinia Treaty, which divided Abyssinia into spheres of influence and mutually recognized each other. Although France abandoned this right, the United Kingdom and Italy did not. Britain's main interest lies in the famous Lake Tana. After the water level of the lake is raised, it can be used to irrigate most of the farmland in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, so as to grow cotton and supply the British industry. Currently, the construction of embankments around Lake Tana is underway. The committee organized by Sudan, Egypt and Abyssinia is currently discussing the details of the water distribution of the Blue Nile. London believes that this water conservancy project is based on past contracts and has nothing to do with the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and does not harm Italy's interests, so it is very strange that Italian newspapers attack this matter. In general, in the coming months, Britain will continue to act as a mediator to eliminate the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and continue to persuade Italy not to engage in war. However, if war unfortunately breaks out, Britain will probably not take any action, because Britain does not want to hurt the mouse for fear of breaking the vase, so as to drive Italy into Germany's arms. If Britain intends to take action on the Italo-Ethiopian war, the only way is to blockade the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal was subject to a treaty concluded by various countries in 1888, which stipulates that ships of all countries should be allowed to pass freely in peacetime or wartime. However, British Liberal Party member of parliament Yude published a declaration in the Lower House on June 7, advocating invoking Article 20 of the League of Nations Covenant (which stipulates that member states should take steps to repeal international obligations undertaken before joining the League of Nations that conflict with the articles of the Covenant) to abolish the system of free navigation of the Suez Canal in wartime. Mandel's proposal may be a way to deal with Italy, but in practice, it is difficult to implement. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Saturday Set as Fascist Movement Day: Full Focus on Military Training</h3>
<p>The Cabinet, in accordance with Mussolini's wishes, has stipulated that Saturday afternoon be Fascist Movement Day. All work by the people must cease, and they must devote all their energy to military training and physical exercise. According to the existing regulations of Fascist groups in Italy, Sunday is reserved for personal rest and cultivation. However, the current regulation extends this practice to all people. According to the Cabinet's order, all work must stop at one o'clock on Saturday afternoon, and employers must not deduct wages. If employers are only willing to pay half wages, then the amount of work during the week must be reduced. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

After Mussolini finished speaking, the audience applauded like thunder, and finally broke through the police cordon, surrounded the car that the Prime Minister was riding in, and cheered enthusiastically before dispersing.

<h3>Aftermath of Luo Binghui's Remnants Disturbing the Zhejiang Border</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Communication: The southeastern border of Zhejiang Province adjoins the three provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian. The two bandit leaders, Fang Zhimin and Luo Binghui, had entrenched themselves in eastern Jiangxi for six or seven years, causing harm to the local area. Last year, they attempted to implement their plan to expand the bandit area, disturbing more than ten counties including Jiangshan, Changshan, Kaihua, Quzhou, Longyou, Shou, Jingning, and Qingyuan along the Anhui-Zhejiang border. After the Zhejiang Security Regiment led by Hui Jishi, together with the National Army, launched a campaign to suppress them, the key figures Fang Zhimin, Liu Chouxi, Xun Weizhou, and others were captured and killed, and the main bandit forces were gradually eliminated. The border area of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui gained temporary peace. At that time, although eastern Jiangxi was declared cleared, the bandit forces on the Fujian border were not yet eliminated. All the remnants of Luo Binghui's forces gathered in the southern Fujian area. Recently, Luo Binghui's puppet independent division commander, Su Yu, and Luo Binghui's puppet army group chief of staff, Liu Ying, joined forces in southern Fujian, with a force of more than 2,000 men and complete weaponry. They have also gathered the remnants of Fang Zhimin's bandits and are roaming through the counties bordering Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. The southeastern Zhejiang areas of Jinhua, Quzhou, Yanping, Wenzhou, and Chuzhou have all been disturbed, with incidents of kidnapping, burning, robbery, and murder, causing considerable damage to the local area. Fortunately, the Security Regiment quickly pursued and suppressed them. The bandits did not dare to stay long in any one place they passed through and immediately moved to other places. The details of the suppression and defense are as follows: In early April of this year, Su Yu and Liu Ying joined forces and infiltrated Qingyuan County on the Zhejiang border from Zhenhe County on the Fujian border. They immediately broke into smaller units and scattered to loot, increasing the number of targets for our bandit suppression troops and making it difficult to advance. They disturbed the counties of Qingyuan, Jingning, and Taishun in mid-April, always returning to their base in Zhenhe, Songxi, and Shouning in Fujian. The Zhejiang Security Regiment and the regular forces and core teams of various counties pursued and intercepted them day and night. Although some annihilation and captures occurred at Liushantou and Taoyang in Jingning, on the border of Songxi and Qingyuan, and at Meikeng and Gejiadishangbiao, the loss to the main bandit force was limited. Because the bandit force was purely mobile in nature, using the narrow paths of the border counties, and immediately retreated back to their nest on the Fujian border upon encountering interception. On April 30, Su Yu and Liu Ying's combined force of more than 600 men and guns re-entered the Qilang Village from Qingyuan Hahu, hoping to rely on the dangerous terrain for defense. At that time, two regiments from the National Army's Liu Brigade joined the siege, sealing off their escape route. The bandits then fled north to Yixi Village in Longquan, and after our troops pursued them separately, the bandits turned south to Bodailling in Longquan between Huangcun and Yecun, and溃入松溪in Songxi in Fujian via the northwest of Qingyuan. On May 7, they split into two groups, each with about two or three hundred men, and after successive blockades, one group retreated back to Shouning, and the other group fled to the border of Longyou, Suichang, and Songxi, turning into Daxi in Suichang, planning to flee to Jiangshan Dingcun. After being severely suppressed head-on, they retreated to the border between Jiangshan and Pucheng. On the 14th, more than 800 bandits were discovered again, attempting to flee to Longqing. After being blocked, a portion fled into Longquan, and after pursuit, they fled through Cai'ao Ridge to Guanju. A portion of the bandits who retreated to Pucheng on the 18th re-entered Suichang Dazhe to Songyang Gushi. At that time, the Tax Police Regiment also received orders to join the suppression. The bandits were attacked and fled to Damafu in Suichang, reaching Zhangcun in the northeast, in an extremely difficult situation. They then crossed to Tangxi, fled through Dongkeng to Shangyang Village on the border of Tangxi Longyou. After being blocked by the government army, they fled again through the area of Xikou Lingshan Temple Xiashibidi in Longyou, planning to flee to Hushan Town in Suichang. At that time, a portion of the bandits were only thirty li away from Nuzhou Quanwang in Qu County. Our army gathered from all sides to pursue them, and the bandits split into groups and fled to places such as Lutou Huduikou on the border of Longyou, Suichang, and Jiangshan, where many were killed along the way. The bandits then split into small groups and fled to Wangwu, Huangshayao, and Yinling Xuanping County. On the 30th, the bandit groups reunited again and fled southeast from the vicinity of Tangxi. The bandits southwest of Suichang fled to Wushankou again, disintegrated and scattered, and roamed through the counties of Xuanping, Suichang, Longyou, Longquan, Jingning, Songyang, Tangxi, Wuyi, Taishun, and Qingyuan. At that time, various groups such as Fan Chumin and Huang Ligui took the opportunity to infiltrate Zhejiang, echoing each other, taking advantage of the rugged mountain roads on the border and the inconvenience of transportation. They fled hither and thither, like wolves running amok. All the blocking and suppression troops are still pursuing them day and night. In the battle of Beijie Town on the 10th of this month, more than 300 bandits were completely annihilated, and many others were captured. Currently, the Zhejiang provincial authorities have drafted a concrete plan to eliminate the roving bandits, which will be submitted for approval and implementation immediately, and have telegraphed to the garrison in southern Fujian for joint blocking to cut off the bandits' return route. Then, the bandits who are like roving bandits can be eliminated in a short period of time. (June 16)</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong's Troops Pass Through Baoding for Shaanxi Successively, Guan Linzheng's Troops Also Head to Northern Shaanxi to Suppress Bandits, Population Increase After Hebei Provincial Government Moved to Baoding</h3>
<p>Baoding Communication: The former Chairman of Hebei Province, Yu Xuezhong, has been ordered to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the border area of Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces. Yu has decided to first transfer the three divisions of Li Zhentang, Du Jiwu, and Chen Guanqun to the west. Li's troops arrived in Baoding at 4:00 PM on the 12th, taking two special trains. The headquarters of the 51st Army stationed here dispatched personnel to the station to take care of everything. The first train consisted of eight covered cars and thirteen open cars, and the second train consisted of seven covered cars and thirteen open cars. The 3rd Battalion of the Division, as well as the military supply and ordnance departments, arrived here on these two trains. The first train departed for Zhengzhou at 5:10 PM and will transfer to the Longhai Line to the west. The second train is also scheduled to depart that night. It is reported that the railway bureau has prepared a total of ten train cars to facilitate the aforementioned transfers. Chen Guanqun's troops are now concentrated in a certain location, and Du Jiwu's troops are also preparing to move. Their artillery brigade and cavalry division are scheduled to depart last. The army headquarters has decided that all troops will be completely transferred within five days. Yu Xuezhong returned to Baoding from Pingjin a few days ago, and various circles went to the station to welcome him. After Yu got off the train, he immediately summoned officers above the rank of lieutenant to give instructions, reporting on the relocation of the troops. After the instructions, he went to his private residence to rest. In the afternoon, the heads of various departments visited. Yu is scheduled to go to Zhengzhou on the 13th to coordinate the movement of the troops. He plans to stay in Zhengzhou for a short period of time and then lead the troops into Shaanxi when the headquarters of the 51st Army arrives in Zhengzhou. The vanguard of the 25th Division of Guan Linzheng's troops passed through Baoding and went south in the afternoon of the 12th and will go to northern Shaanxi to suppress bandits via the Zhengtai Railway. Also, the 4th Brigade of the 2nd Division of Huang Jie's troops arrived in Baoding on foot from Pingjin yesterday and went south in the afternoon. The remaining troops in Baoding are also scheduled to depart south on the 13th. Huang himself arrived in Baoding from Pingjin at 4:00 PM on the 13th.</p>
<p>According to a recent investigation by the Public Security Bureau, the population of Baoding is over 80,000 in the urban area, mostly engaged in commerce. According to an investigation by the Qingyuan County government in the rural area, it is about 400,000 people, mostly engaged in agriculture. There are only a few foreign missionaries and a Japanese merchant named Miyazaki. It is learned that after the provincial government moved here, the population of the urban area has increased by about 4,000, according to estimates by the Public Security Bureau. (14th)</p>
<h3>Chaoshan Holds Security Conference, Most Communist Bandits in Various Districts Eliminated</h3>
<p>Shantou Communication: The remaining bandits on the Fujian-Jiangxi border have been gradually eliminated. Chen Jitang previously sent Chief of Staff Miao Peinan to the east to discuss with the military officers stationed in Chaozhou and Meizhou about measures to maintain stability and suppress bandits within the territory. Li Yangjing, the commissioner of the Eastern District and commander of the Third Army, has also been touring the Eastern District from the province recently and has now arrived in Huiyang and will soon arrive in Shantou. The Eastern District Commissioner's Office telegraphed an order summoning the magistrates and the deputy directors of the security team training from the 24 counties in the Eastern District to arrive in Shantou before the 17th to attend the security conference and to inspect the military and police in various counties. Currently, the military forces stationed in Chaozhou and Meizhou include the troops of Huang Renbao, Huang Yanzhen, and Deng Longguang. The banditry in the eastern territory of Dabu on the Fujian border has been slightly suppressed. The remnants of Zhang Dingcheng's forces, numbering over 1,000, in the Phoenix Mountains have been surrounded and suppressed by Zeng Youren's brigade, resulting in the deaths of over 500 bandits. The bandits fled back to the mountains of Yongding and Pinghe on the Fujian border. Zeng's brigade is currently stationed in Raoping City, striving to search and suppress the remaining bandits in Phoenix Mountains. The remaining bandits in Sangpu Mountain, Beishan, Nanshan, and Baxiang Mountain are also being diligently searched for by the military and police. Huang Tianping, the bandit leader of Sangpu Mountain, secretly returned to Zhaopu Township in Fujian last week and was reported to the defense army by the district chief, who killed Huang. Also, troops stationed in Jiaoshan Township entered Tianxin Township in Sangpu Mountain and captured a male and a female bandit. Various districts and townships near the mountain are actively engaged in joint defense. Chen Yubo, the deputy district chief of the 9th District of Chaoyang, was captured and shot by Deng Longguang for extorting the local people to provide supplies to the local bandits in Nanshan. The bandits in Nanshan have been surrounded by Deng's division for two months, resulting in the deaths of over 500 bandits and the discovery of eight important bandit organizations, including prisons. More than 120 men and women hostages were rescued. Recently, Battalion Commander Liu of the Huilai defense army led troops to Dagutan in Nanshan, where they uncovered one sham political prison and one capitalist prison. These prisons were located in stone caves. When the defense army arrived, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. The defense army finally dispersed the bandits. The remaining bandits, numbering over twenty, hid in the depths of the stone cave. Battalion Commander Liu led a hand-picked team to rush into the cave, killing on the spot A Lei, the head of the Nanshan fake military affairs department, and more than ten key bandits, capturing ten male and female bandits, seizing more than ten long and short guns, and rescuing twelve hostages. It is reported that the bandits' fake military headquarters is located near Dawo Mountain. Battalion Commander Liu rushed to encircle and suppress again, killing more than ten bandits, capturing ten guns, and taking five prisoners. Because the fake military headquarters was set on the waist of a precipitous cliff, with stone caves inside, making it difficult to climb, many bandits escaped. Generally speaking, most of the major communist bandits in Chaozhou and Meizhou have been eliminated through the joint suppression of various armies and are no longer capable.</p>
<p>Li Yangjing inspected the military in Chaozhou and Jiangdong and paid close attention to the work of training security teams and reserve teams in various counties. This is a necessary stage for implementing conscription. Currently, the police teams in various counties in Chaozhou and Meizhou are organized and trained in imitation of the Guangxi province. Starting from August this year, the money and grain in various counties will be changed to land tax, calculated according to the measured and investigated tax amount of land, which can collect 14 million yuan annually. The Finance Department stipulates that half of it will be retained by the counties as administrative and security expenses, so there will be more than 7 million yuan of security expenses each year. Li Yangjing came to Chaoshan to inspect the military and convene a security conference, which is probably related to this matter.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Representatives from Siam Return to Guangdong to Urge Speedy Treaty Negotiation and Abolition of Harsh Regulations</h3>
<p>Shantou Communication: The maltreatment of overseas Chinese in Siam has aroused a nationwide call for a boycott of Siamese rice. As a result, the Siamese government is quite willing to change its ways. The Overseas Chinese Club of Bangkok in Siam convened a general meeting of overseas Chinese organizations and elected Zheng Haonan and Li Fubiao to return to the country to make a sincere appeal to the authorities, urging them to quickly conclude a commercial treaty and abolish the harsh regulations. Zheng and Li passed through Shantou yesterday on their way to the province. According to them, the latest situation of anti-Chinese activities in Siam is as follows: (1) Each ship sailing from China to Siam shall not allow more than 500 Chinese immigrants to enter. (2) New immigrants to Siam must pay an entrance tax of 100 baht, which is about 160 silver dollars, at one time. (3) Uneducated women are not allowed to disembark under any circumstances, otherwise the original ship will be escorted back. (4) Overseas Chinese laborers' children under the age of seven must pay a deposit of 500 baht when leaving the country. If the person is over eighteen years old and does not return to Siam, the deposit will be confiscated. (5) Overseas Chinese laborers' children who are eighteen years old have the obligation to serve in the military. (6) The Overseas Chinese Business Regulations previously promulgated stipulate that the bookkeeping used by Chinese stores must be changed to Siamese, and Siamese must be hired as clerks, which must be implemented as soon as possible. (7) Overseas Chinese are not allowed to gather for resistance meetings, otherwise they will be punished with extreme penalties for violating national law. (8) After Siam closed overseas Chinese schools this spring, all overseas Chinese children were forcibly transferred to Thai schools, and the original Chinese schools were virtually eliminated. (9) Restrictions on remittances by overseas Chinese to their home country. (10) Overseas Chinese returning to the country must obtain an exit paper from the Siamese government and are restricted from carrying more than 100 yuan in cash out of the country. (11) Promulgation of the number of Chinese laborers to be employed and the time of service. (12) For fishing boats operated by Chinese, each ship owner must hire a Siamese person to serve as the captain, and Siamese persons must also account for one-tenth of the fishing crew, otherwise they will not be allowed to go fishing. According to Zheng and Li, 3 million overseas Chinese, under this severe oppression, have no other way but to appeal to the government for help. At present, overseas Chinese commerce and industry have been greatly damaged, and the fear of unemployment is becoming more and more serious. Since May, one million people have returned to their country due to being unable to bear the oppression. Therefore, the local overseas Chinese elected Zheng and Li to return to their country to earnestly ask for government assistance. (12th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Joy of Sweet Rain, Passerby Dies</h3>
<p>It is the season of mold, but there has been a long drought. The rice seedlings are withering. On the 16th, the weather was scorching hot. By noon, dark clouds were dense, and sweet rain was celebrated. However, around 4:00 PM, when the fourth-class train from Hangzhou arrived in Songjiang, a passenger got off the train. While walking south of the Malu Bridge, he suddenly encountered a torrential downpour. He ran as fast as he could, but accidentally stumbled and fell to the ground and died immediately. Passersby stopped to watch. Someone recognized the deceased as Chen Shaohong from Shihudang, who worked as a farmer. His sister currently lives in the Zhu residence near Foyu Bridge in the city. The deceased was wearing a black cloth jacket and white cloth pants. The patrol officer immediately reported the incident to the Public Security Substation. His sister was summoned to the scene to identify the body. She was very grieved. The Songjiang Public Security Bureau has requested the County Court to send someone to examine the body.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Student Police Arrests Ship Crew Members, Dispute</h3>
<p>On the 14th, at 11:00 AM, the connecting ship between Jiading and Nanxiang on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway departed from Jiading. A student police officer surnamed Wu from the Nanxiang Public Security Sub-bureau boarded the ship to Nanxiang. Sheng Guisheng, a crew member, asked him to buy a ticket. Wu initially refused but then agreed to buy a half-price ticket. Sheng insisted on a full-price ticket in accordance with the regulations. Passengers on the ship also spoke in support. Wu reluctantly bought a full-price ticket. Unexpectedly, he considered this an insult. After arriving in Nanxiang, he did not hand over the purchased ticket to the ticket collector and reported the incident to the Public Security Sub-bureau of the town by telephone. As a result, dozens of student police officers came to make trouble for Sheng. However, Sheng had already supervised the ship north to Jiading. The police officers waited at the dock. Someone, fearing trouble, telegraphed the Jiading Shipping Company. The company considered there were passengers with Shanghai-Nanjing train connecting tickets waiting in Nanxiang. So, not avoiding danger, it still sailed to Nanxiang at 3:00 PM. When it arrived at the dock, the police officers immediately arrested Sheng Guisheng and the other nine crew members and took them to the bureau. The bureau chief, Zheng Qi, interrogated them and ordered them to be detained together. The crew members were detained, and the ship could not sail. The passengers waiting for the ship made a great commotion. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Zhixiao, and the executive member of the county, Lu Linxun, heard the news and went to the bureau to request their temporary release, but Zheng refused. The shipping company urgently sent an employee, Qi Wenzhen, to Nanxiang with money to return the money for the connecting tickets and take them back. The passengers then dispersed. When the county's Public Security Bureau Chief, Chen Youmin, heard the news, he ordered the sub-bureau chief Zheng to release the detained crew members. It was already midnight. On the 15th, the crew members went on strike and the ship stopped running. The matter is currently under negotiation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Joint Meeting of Chamber of Commerce Executives and Supervisors</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local county Chamber of Commerce held its fourteenth joint meeting of executives and supervisors, chaired by Qian Sunqing. The following important items were resolved: (1) The Education Promotion Association sent a letter requesting cooperation in establishing a vocational supplementary school and attached a draft plan. The matter requires fundraising, but the market is currently depressed and the financial situation is extremely panic. It was decided to send a letter of reply immediately, and to consider social economy and negotiate the matter when the market turns slightly. (2) The Jiangsu Finance Department and the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation successively sent letters informing of the organization of a commodity marketing organization in the province. It was decided to follow the results of the meeting held in the province on the 3rd of this month and first have the Finance Department hire bankers and businessmen to establish a design committee, and then wait for the provincial department's design before contacting them for handling.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Matricide Case, Inspection Conducted in Township</h3>
<p>Xu Jinfu, an unnatural son of the Huanpu Township in Luyuan, whose animal instincts flared up the day before, actually used a kitchen knife and a sickle to cut and kill his own mother, Qian. The situation was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. On the 15th, the county government's trial investigator, Hu Cheng, accompanied by the coroner Shen Guifang, went to the township to inspect the case. Because it was an unprecedented major case of unnatural incest, the countryside paid extraordinary attention. No less than three thousand people went to the scene to inspect the body. The murderer, Xu Jinfu, was taken to the scene by the Public Security Bureau to await trial. At 4:30, the inspection began. It was found that there were eight knife wounds on the back of the deceased's head, neck, chest, and other parts, and the throat was cut, which was indeed fatal. After the inspection, the judge returned to the city by the original ship, which was already past 10:00 PM. The murderer is still being taken back by the Public Security Bureau and will be handed over to the county's judiciary for interrogation on the 16th.</p>

<h3>Nantong: Discussing Relief for Drought in Four Townships</h3>
<p>The Tongyi has not rained for a long time, and the rivers in the four townships have dried up to the bottom. Cotton and rice are short of irrigation water and have withered. At present, drinking water is lacking. The locals are digging springs at the bottom of the river. The Construction Bureau is trying to alleviate the drought by introducing Jiang tidal irrigation and is planning to use electric pumps at the port to draw water.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Kidnapping Case in Coral Village</h3>
<p>Qi Qichang, a resident of Coral Village at the junction of Yu Hui and Dingzha, is wealthy and cultivates more than 200 acres of land, but the area is frequented by bandits. Therefore, Qichang himself and others, such as Jin Zheng, moved elsewhere to avoid them. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 15th, someone knocked on the door of the Qi family. The workers, not being careful, immediately put on their clothes and opened the door. More than a dozen bandits rushed in, tied up all the workers, and forbade them from making noise. They broke into the room. At that time, Qi's wife was holding her only eight-month-old boy, intending to find a place to hide. They were spotted by the bandits, who stopped Qi's wife and snatched the boy from her arms. They scattered with whoops. Also, on the afternoon of the 15th, more than 300 refugees from Hunan suddenly arrived at the Tianrenzhuangzhen Rindianbang and acted recklessly, looting the entire village. No one was spared, especially the Shoulin family in the suburbs suffered the greatest losses.</p>

<p>Municipal Party Headquarters' Message to Comrades and Compatriots</p>
<p>The Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Municipal Party Headquarters in this city specially issued a message to comrades and compatriots regarding the passage of Mr. Liao Zhongkai's coffin through Shanghai. The original text is as follows: "Dear comrades and compatriots, the Central Government has specially dispatched an envoy to Guangdong to welcome and bury Mr. Liao Zhongkai's coffin beside the Premier's mausoleum. Now, on the day of its passage through Shanghai and the temporary placement of the coffin, in addition to devoutly holding a memorial service, we would like to briefly describe the historical facts of Mr. Liao's revolution and his great spirit as follows, to inform comrades and compatriots. Mr. Liao, named Enxu, styled Zhongkai, was a native of Huiyang County, Guangdong. His father was a merchant in America. Mr. Liao was born on March 10th, thirty-four years before the founding of the Republic of China. At the age of seventeen, he returned to China. At the age of twenty-two, he married Madam He Xiangning, and they were a devoted couple. Subsequently, he went to Japan to study economics and finance, achieving profound accomplishments. When the Russo-Japanese War broke out and China was in danger, the Premier went to Tokyo, gathered revolutionary comrades from seventeen provinces, and organized the Chinese Tongmenghui. Mr. Liao and his wife both joined. Later, during the Xinhai Revolution, the campaign to punish Yuan Shikai, and the protection of the Constitution, he participated in every battle. In particular, in managing finance, he provided great assistance to the revolutionary military needs. In peacetime, he especially strived to promote the peasant and worker movements and improve the lives of peasants and workers. Mr. Liao also contributed greatly to the establishment of the Whampoa Military Academy. After the Premier's death, Mr. Liao assisted Comrade Chiang Kai-shek in suppressing the Yang and Liu rebellions and assisted in organizing the National Government, unifying military and civilian finances to consolidate the revolutionary foundation. Mr. Liao loved the party as his life and hated evil as his enemy. Consequently, counter-revolutionaries conspired against Mr. Liao. On August 20th of the fourteenth year, Mr. Liao was assassinated by counter-revolutionaries, at the young age of forty-nine. This is not only a major loss for our party, but also a major loss for the entire nation. Mr. Liao's noble character, outstanding achievements, and profound knowledge are well known to the world. It must be known that Mr. Liao's achievements were so great because they were based on the cultivation of his revolutionary personality. Today, as we welcome and bury Mr. Liao, we dare to present several points as models: (1) Perseverance: Mr. Liao followed the Premier and devoted himself to the revolution for more than twenty years. During that time, he experienced much hardship and tribulation, and he never wavered in his revolutionary aspirations. Because of this perseverance, he was able to struggle and sacrifice in difficult circumstances, dedicating himself completely and achieving great achievements in revolutionary history. (2) Loyalty: Mr. Liao was a loyal follower of the Premier. Throughout his life, he shared joys and sorrows with the Premier, absolutely obeyed the Premier's orders and the party's discipline, knew only to shoulder obligations, and did not haggle over rights. He dedicated all his intelligence and talent to the party. This revolutionary red heart of loyalty should be emulated by comrades and compatriots today. (3) Diligence and integrity: Mr. Liao worked more than eleven or twelve hours a day, and sometimes even sixteen or seventeen hours. His hard work for national affairs is evident. Mr. Liao lived frugally. Although he held financial positions repeatedly, he remained upright and clean, with no surplus wealth in his family. This kind of integrity should shame corrupt officials. (4) Scholarship: Mr. Liao worked hard to learn in his youth. Even in his adulthood, while engaging in revolution, he did not forget to seek knowledge, constantly learning throughout his life. Therefore, his revolutionary will and spirit were always tense and vigorous, and his knowledge also increased with the times. This spirit of not forgetting to study while engaging in revolution is most worthy of emulation by revolutionaries. Today, as we welcome and bury Mr. Liao, on this day of serious national crisis with internal troubles and foreign invasions, we should emulate Mr. Liao's personality to promote the completion of our party's revolutionary cause and accomplish Mr. Liao's unfinished legacy. 1. Liao Zhongkai is not dead. 2. Liao Zhongkai was the Premier's loyal follower. 3. Liao Zhongkai was the savior of peasant and worker compatriots. 4. Liao Zhongkai's great personality is a model for comrades and compatriots across the country. 5. Emulate Liao Zhongkai's revolutionary spirit. 6. Welcoming and burying Mr. Liao means eliminating the Red Bandits and relieving the suffering of peasants and workers. 7. Welcoming and burying Mr. Liao means uniting sincerely to save the country from its crisis. 8. Welcoming and burying Mr. Liao means developing production and enriching national strength. 9. Long live the Three Principles of the People. 10. Long live the Chinese Kuomintang. 11. Long live the Republic of China. Shanghai Special Municipal Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>
<h3>President Wang and Others Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan Wang Zhaoming, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Youren, and Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming took the night express train from Beijing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Inspectors Chen Chunpu and Zheng Lin of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Nanyang Consulates Returned Home Yesterday; Impressions of the Consulates, Overseas Chinese, and Commerce</h3>
<p>In order to inspect the consulates in Nanyang and to understand the actual conditions of commerce and overseas Chinese affairs in various places, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially dispatched Ministry Advisor Mr. Liang Zigaoxian, Standing Committee Member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and Director of the Overseas Chinese Education Department Mr. Chen Chunpu, and former Counselor of the Ministry of Railways Mr. Zheng Tao in February of this year. Mr. Liang departed slightly later due to other important business and is currently still en route. Mr. Chen and Mr. Zheng departed in early March and traveled through Annam, the Malay Peninsula, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines for more than three months. Recently, their mission completed, they returned home from the Philippines on the Empress of Canada, arriving in port at 1:30 PM yesterday. Director Yu Ming of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Wu Gonghu of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau went to the port to welcome them. Accompanying Mr. Chen and Mr. Zheng were secretaries Su Hongbin and Luo Haiguang. Mr. Chen and Mr. Zheng issued a written statement of their impressions of their trip to Nanyang as follows:</p>
<p>The Mission's Tasks</p>
<p>According to them, the mission's tasks can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) inspecting consulates, (2) investigating commerce, and (3) investigating overseas Chinese affairs. More than ten people departed from Shanghai on the "Asama Maru No. 2" on March 9 and successively passed through Saigon, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Penang, Siam, Bangkok, Medan, Batavia, Bandung, Cheribon, Tegal, Semarang, Magelang, Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Surabaya, Malang, Zhangge, Garapalu, Wainanmeng, Bali, Makassar, and Manila.</p>
<p>Consulate Administration</p>
<p>Most consulates in various places are still diligently handling affairs, but it seems necessary to improve the institutional aspects. Consuls are originally commercial officers, and their responsibility is to promote commerce and protect overseas Chinese. In recent years, consulates in various places have conducted various investigations and statistics on local commerce, but there are still few efforts to obtain information suitable for actual needs to promote trade between them. Therefore, it is believed that the organization and administrative efficiency of the consulates cannot be improved without comprehensive planning. This matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished without detailed regulations in the institutional aspects and improvements in personnel and finance.</p>
<p>Commerce in Various Places</p>
<p>As for the commercial situation in various places, Annam is said to be declining, with empty shops everywhere. On the one hand, this is affected by the economic downturn, and on the other hand, it is because the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement has not yet been established, which affects trade between the two sides. If the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement is concluded, China will establish consulates in Saigon, Haiphong, and Hanoi to promote commerce and protect overseas Chinese. The situation may improve in the future. The Malay Peninsula has a more reviving atmosphere. Recently, rubber and tin have seen slight improvements, so the commercial situation is better than in other places. In the Dutch East Indies, import and export are difficult due to heavy taxation, and the high exchange rate also hits foreign trade. In addition, the local people's knowledge is gradually opening up, and the position of our intermediary merchants is gradually being shaken. Overseas Chinese merchants in the Philippines are mostly retailers and timber merchants, and their operations are still acceptable. However, because the Philippines has been striving for independence in recent years, there is an organization of the National Economic Maintenance Association, which has some impact on the business of our overseas Chinese merchants. There have been repeated discoveries of the squeezing out of our overseas Chinese merchants recently.</p>
<p>Conditions of Overseas Chinese Compatriots</p>
<p>As for the overseas Chinese in various places, they are very concerned about the motherland, eagerly inquiring about the political construction in the country, etc., in great detail. Their sincerity in promoting domestic goods is no less than that of people in the country. Due to the influence of the dumping of goods from other countries, it is difficult for domestic goods to gain a foothold. However, if there can be a considerable organization in transportation, distribution, and economics, then the future can still be optimistic. As for the chambers of commerce in various places, those with relatively complete organizations, such as the chambers of commerce in Singapore, Siam, Medan, and Batavia, can indeed seek many benefits for the overseas Chinese. In terms of party affairs, there are many restrictions in British territories due to the exchange of documents, so there is little obvious achievement in the promotion of party affairs. Although the party headquarters in the Dutch East Indies can be open, work and activities are also difficult, so overseas comrades feel tired and exhausted this year.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Education</p>
<p>In terms of overseas Chinese education, in addition to visiting schools, we also held talks with the local education community to inquire about the local education situation and opinions. Here is a brief description of the situation in various places. In Annam, education is not yet developed, and the curriculum and teaching in various schools still need to be improved. Most schools still teach in local dialects and should switch to Mandarin as soon as possible. The management of overseas Chinese education in the Malay Peninsula is not bad, but a small number of schools teach English from kindergarten in order to receive subsidies from the local government. This point is not in line with national basic education. Overseas Chinese education in Siam is difficult to manage because the local government implements compulsory education, making it difficult for our overseas Chinese schools to operate. Overseas Chinese education in the Dutch East Indies is experiencing financial difficulties due to the economic downturn, but those who run the schools are still able to find various ways to support the past, which is commendable. Currently, the issue of registering with the local government has aroused the suppression of the Dutch East Indies government, which we regret. The purpose of our overseas Chinese schools is purely to cultivate young people and has no political effect. In accordance with the common practice of various countries, applying to the local government for registration is purely for the convenience of students returning to China to check their academic qualifications and has no other intention. The local government does not need to worry too much. Currently, this case is being negotiated, and we firmly believe that if the Dutch East Indies government can understand this point, it should withdraw its order. Overseas Chinese education in the Philippines is more free, but the results are less satisfactory. Overseas Chinese schools in the Philippines teach Chinese in the morning and English in the afternoon. In the hot weather, children have to attend classes all day and also read two languages, which is too tiring. They are also probably not capable enough. At the same time, the curriculum seems to be repetitive. For example, in the subject of arithmetic, there is a distinction between Chinese and English. This point should be studied. We feel that overseas Chinese in various places are very dedicated to running schools. If improvements can be made in the curriculum, teaching, and equipment, it will not be difficult to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Returning to Beijing Within Days</p>
<p>In short, consulates are agencies for protecting overseas Chinese and promoting commerce, and their position is very important. In terms of administration, efforts should be made to improve efficiency and raise their position to facilitate the leadership of the overseas Chinese community. On the part of the overseas Chinese themselves, they should quickly seek unity, concentrate their efforts, and break the habit of each acting for themselves in the past, so that they may be able to save the current crisis by one in ten thousand. There are many other impressions, but due to time constraints, I cannot report them one by one, etc. After arriving in Shanghai, they are staying at the New Asia Hotel and the Oriental Hotel and plan to return to Beijing within the next day or two to report their inspection and return their mandate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Tan Zhen Arrived in Shanghai; Sun Received Mayor Wu; Returning to Beijing in a Few Days</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke was originally scheduled to take the night train to Shanghai on the 14th, but he temporarily postponed it because there were still important public affairs to be dealt with in Beijing. It was not until 11:00 PM the night before that he traveled with Vice President of the Judicial Yuan Tan Zhen by night train from Beijing to Shanghai. At 7:10 AM yesterday morning, he arrived at the Zhenru Station and went directly to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. He then received Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng at 10:50 AM, and they talked for about half an hour before he left. Mr. Sun plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days and then return to Beijing to preside over the affairs of the Legislative Yuan, it was said.</p>

<h3>The State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Took Over the Inland Waterway Routes Yesterday Morning; The Routes Were Taken Over in Three Ways; All Routes Operate as Usual</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the lease period for the inland waterway routes of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has expired. The routes were taken over in three ways yesterday morning, and all routes operate as usual. It has been decided that the Zhenqing, Shenhu, and other five routes will be operated independently, and the remaining routes will continue to be tendered for commercial operation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Counting Account Books and Assets</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's takeover of the inland waterway route vessels was presided over by Chen Weiqing, director of the General Affairs Department and newly appointed manager of the Inland Waterway Steamship Bureau, dispatched by the head office. Mr. Chen, accompanied by takeover committee members Cai Pengcheng and Sheng Qunian, and bureau staff Zhang Yao, Li Rui, You Zhijun, and Zhu Zhilin, went to the bureau at about 9:00 AM yesterday to count account books and assets. In the afternoon, Mr. Chen went again to inspect and accept the various vessels, which were handed over by Zhu Yanping of the Department of Construction, lessee Zhang Jingpei, and Sun Yezhen, a staff member of the Inland Waterway Bureau.</p>
<p>Three Routes Depart to Take Over</p>
<p>In terms of outlying areas, they departed in three routes. For the Zhenjiang to Qingjiangpu route, the handover officer was Zhu Yanping of the Department of Construction, the Inland Waterway Bureau's Shen Songxian, and the takeover officer was Zhou Houkun of the head office. For the route from Zhejiang's Jiaxing, Xiashi, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Shuanglin, to Nanxun, the handover officer was Shen Zelin of the Department of Construction, the Inland Waterway Bureau's Yang Tingmei, and the takeover officer was Zhu Tianbing of the head office. For the route from Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, to Changzhou, the handover officer was Zhong Lisheng of the Department of Construction, the Inland Waterway Bureau's Zhang Jianfei, and the takeover officer was Feng Yuming of the head office. All three groups departed in turn.</p>
<p>Decision to Operate Five Routes Independently</p>
<p>After the bureau took over, it decided that the name would be the China Merchants Inland Waterway Steamship Bureau. The internal organization and personnel will not be changed for the time being. The bureau decided to operate the Zhenqing, Shenhu Ling, Shenhang, Shensu, and Suhang routes independently. The remaining routes will be tendered for commercial operation. If no merchant leases them, the bureau will operate them independently. However, none of the routes will be suspended. Yesterday morning, each route posted a notice from the head office, stating that they would operate as usual, it was said.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chen Shuren of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee Talks About Government Relief for Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Chairman Chen Shuren of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee came to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 15th at 2:30 PM by early train from Beijing under government orders to discuss with Mayor Wu Tiecheng and others the welcoming of Martyr Liao Zhongkai's coffin to Beijing. A reporter from the China East News Agency specially went to his residence at Room 454 of the New Asia Hotel yesterday morning to visit him. He spoke in detail about the government's relief for overseas Chinese, etc.</p>
<p>The Status of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Mr. Chen first told the China East News Agency reporter that in recent years, due to the increasing economic downturn in various countries around the world, our overseas Chinese compatriots have inevitably faced some difficulties. The authorities of various countries, for the sake of their own people's livelihoods, inevitably have some conflicts with overseas Chinese in some jobs, resulting in acts of expulsion. However, our overseas Chinese compatriots, no matter where they live, have a certain characteristic, namely (1) diligence and frugality, (2) gentleness and respect, and (3) peaceful nature and hardworking. Moreover, because of their diligence, their production capacity is more specialized than that of the people of various countries, and at the same time, their wages are lower than those of the people of those places. Therefore, their position has gradually become consolidated in recent years. Although there have been anti-Chinese actions due to various reasons, most of them have been due to emotional impulses. After all, there are many places where various countries need overseas Chinese to help build, so they are very welcoming of overseas Chinese after the event.</p>
<p>The Mexico Incident as Proof</p>
<p>Mr. Chen immediately cited the anti-Chinese incident in Mexico two years ago as proof. At that time, the Mexican government was attacked by Labor Party members, which led to a fierce anti-Chinese movement. However, afterwards, the country needed overseas Chinese to help build, and the voice of Labor Party members opposing Chinese disappeared, because the country's national production and consumption are far inferior to that of overseas Chinese. Although there are anti-Chinese actions in various places now, after protests from various parties and government negotiations, a solution can definitely be found in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Relief for Overseas Chinese Compatriots</p>
<p>The government's relief for overseas Chinese is progressing simultaneously in diplomatic and internal affairs. If there are anti-Chinese incidents in various countries, the government is willing to serve as a backing for the people, arguing on the basis of reason. On the one hand, it is also working hard on its own construction. For example, the construction of Qiaole Village in Xuancheng, Anhui, opened yesterday. Government agencies have sent representatives to participate, which is sufficient to prove the government's emphasis on overseas Chinese compatriots. This move is to prepare in case overseas Chinese have to return to the country out of desperation. The government will naturally accommodate them and find a place for them to settle down, so that overseas Chinese compatriots can advance and retreat. At this time of serious national crisis, the government is planning relief measures for millions of overseas Chinese compatriots, it was said. Mr. Chen will be delayed in Shanghai for two or three days to welcome Mr. Liao's coffin, and will return to Beijing on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Relief for Industry and Commerce Loans; Three Meetings Today; The Committee Guarantees Loans; Banks and Money Shops Directly Lend</h3>
<p>According to the New News Agency, the Relief for Industry and Commerce Guarantee Loan Committee was established a few days ago, and Cai Zengji was publicly elected as chairman, with Du Yuesheng and Wu Xingya as vice chairmen. Chen Guangfu, Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, and Song Ziliang were elected as standing committee members. After a meeting was held on the 15th, the draft charter was discussed in detail and submitted to the chairman for correction. It was decided to convene the third meeting at 2:00 PM today to submit it for approval, and then report it to the Ministry of Finance to receive national treasury vouchers for safekeeping, officially start work,</p>
<p>Nature of the Committee</p>
<p>The nature of this committee is entirely to guarantee loans and does not directly lend. Any factory manufacturing domestic goods, store selling domestic goods, and exporter transporting domestic goods who requests a loan must submit a detailed form with information on assets and liabilities, profit and loss, purpose of the loan, and collateral to the committee for review. If the committee approves it after review, the committee will notify the banks and money shops to directly lend.</p>
<p>Lending by Two Industries</p>
<p>This relief for industry and commerce loans will be directly lent by various banks and money shops and will not be handled by a separate organization. Any factory or store requesting a loan will have its collateral reviewed by the Guarantee Loan Committee. The banks and money shops will then directly lend based on the notice from the Guarantee Committee, using the collateral of the factory or store as the first guarantee and the national treasury vouchers as the second guarantee, with a monthly interest rate of eight per thousand. The repayment period will be determined by both parties, it was said.</p>
<h3>The Air Force Party Headquarters Builds a Memorial Tower for Aviation Martyrs; Built by Sculptor Liu Kaiqu</h3>
<p>In order to commemorate the great spirit of the aviators who gave their lives for the nation in the Songhu Battle and other aviation martyrs who sacrificed themselves to save the country, the Special Party Headquarters of the Air Force decided to erect a solemn Aviation Martyrs Memorial Tower at the Jianqiao Airfield in Hangzhou to honor the national spirit of the martyrs. Liu Kaiqu, the sculptor of the 88th Division Martyrs Memorial Tower in Hangzhou's West Lake, was invited to plan and undertake various sculpting and construction works. Lei Kuiyuan, a professor at the Hangzhou Art Academy, is in charge of the decoration and construction engineering. It will begin soon, and the entire tower can be completed in the middle of autumn this year, it was said.</p>
<h3>Martyr Yu Hongzhang's Tomb Commemorative Monument Unveiled Yesterday</h3>
<p>Media representative Mao Chunpu reported on the circumstances of his martyrdom. The Shanghai Coal Industry Association, for their colleague Martyr Yu Hongzhang, who died for the country while participating in the rescue work during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, publicly buried him in the International Cemetery and erected a monument to commemorate him. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, representatives from various circles were invited to hold a monument unveiling ceremony at the tomb site. Attendees included Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representative Yuan Hongjun, Red Cross representative Wei Tiezheng, Xianju Fellow Townsmen Association representative Wang Jingdong, Coal Industry Association representatives Mao Chunpu, Xu Yirong, Luo Dechuan, as well as family members and guests, totaling over two hundred people. The weather suddenly changed, and amidst the bleak wind and bitter rain, the mourning was further intensified. Immediately afterward, a meeting was held as scheduled, with Coal Industry Association representatives Mao Chunpu, Xu Wanrong, and Luo Dechuan serving as the presidium. After reporting on the circumstances of the martyr's death, representatives from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Red Cross successively delivered speeches. Finally, his elder brother Hongkui delivered a speech of thanks. Subsequently, he led the guests to view the tombstone. The event concluded at 4:00 PM. The inscription on the tombstone reads as follows: Yu Shanqing, courtesy name Hongzhang, was from Yin County, Zhejiang. He was born at the Yin hour on the 27th day of the tenth month of the third year of Xuantong. He died at the Shen hour on the 29th day of the second month of the 21st year of the Republic. His father, Mr. Yingchu, was in the coal business and established Dun Dacheng Coal Company on Zhili Road in Shanghai for several decades. He had seven sons, and Hongzhang was the fifth. He was born intelligent and resolute. In his youth, he was filled with patriotic thoughts. After the September 18th Shenyang Incident in the 20th year of the Republic, he immediately wanted to join the army, but his family prevented him. When the January 28th Songhu War broke out in the 21st year of the Republic, he organized a Red Cross rescue team with colleagues in the coal industry. Later, he joined the First Special Team and went to the front lines every day to carry out rescue work for soldiers and civilians. On the 29th day of the second month, during the fierce battle at Baziqiao, our army's position was lost and regained three times, with the dead lying on top of each other. Hongzhang, together with six members of the Eleventh Detachment, went to the front line on the morning of the 29th to rescue the wounded soldiers. When the vehicle reached the end of Baoxing Road, they proceeded on foot. At 10:30 AM, near Xingjiaqiao, they were spotted by enemy soldiers and shot, injuring his chest and thighs. He fell to the ground, bleeding. His companions carried him onto the vehicle and drove him and the wounded soldiers to Baolong Hospital. The rescue was ineffective, and he died at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. He was buried in the International Cemetery. He was 22 years old and unmarried. According to the rules of the International Cemetery, during wartime, rescuers from the Red Cross are not regarded as enemy combatants. Now, Japanese soldiers shot non-combatants, and their inhuman behavior is extreme. The world will have its own fair judgment on this. Our association is deeply saddened by Mr. Hongzhang's enthusiasm for loving the country and sacrificing himself for the country's difficulties. Therefore, we specially record the general situation and inscribe it on stone to inform the survivors and future generations.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Sent Representatives to Petition in Beijing Yesterday, Appealing to the Central Party Headquarters and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for Relief</h3>
<p>According to Shiye News Agency, amidst the high-pitched calls for amity between China and Japan, the Japanese government's expulsion of overseas Chinese continues unabated. The number of overseas Chinese who have been expelled and returned to the country has reached more than 600, and their livelihoods are extremely difficult. It is learned that eight refugees from the 61st batch recently expelled to Shanghai, namely Zeng Jin-ying, Liu Jin-qi, Ye Pan-mei, Wu Xi-qi, Liu Liang-zhou, Ruan Shao-jun, Liu Ye-dang, and Wu An-ji, are all members of the Kuomintang. Because they are residing in Shanghai and unable to make a living, they specially dispatched representative Wu Xi-qi to Beijing on the overnight express train at 11:00 PM last night to report the experience of being expelled by Japan to Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Central Party Headquarters, and to request relief to maintain their remaining lives.</p>

<h3>Promotion of Commercial Acceptance Drafts: Chamber of Commerce Lecture Series Closed Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held a lecture series to promote commercial acceptance drafts. Yesterday was the last session. Luo Qinghua, Deputy Manager of the Silk Industry Bank, delivered a closing speech and invited three experts, Zhu Xinong, Cai Chengxin, and Wang Xiaowen, to give lectures. Li Peilin took shorthand notes. More than 300 representatives from various industries listened to the lectures, and committee members Zheng Chengqing and Ma Shaocha provided hospitality. The speeches of each person are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Luo's Closing Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Luo Qinghua delivered a closing speech, saying, "Today is the last session of the commercial acceptance draft lecture series held by our chamber. We are pleased to have economists Mr. Zhu Xinong and Mr. Cai Chengxin, and legal expert Mr. Wang Xiaowen, to grace us with their lectures. Representatives from various industries actively participated, which is extremely gratifying. In the past two sessions, experts were invited to attend and express their grand theories. The theoretical value of commercial acceptance drafts and the procedures for implementation have been elaborated in detail, which can serve as a reference for the actual promotion of various industries. The Silk Industry Association has been pioneering the use of commercial acceptance drafts for three months now. Although the subsequent promotion by various industries has not yet been popularized, the objective need for commercial acceptance drafts has become increasingly urgent with the excessive tightening of industrial and commercial credit. Since the financial turmoil last winter, there has been no hope of recovery for industry and commerce. Recently, the situation has become even worse, and the crisis is becoming increasingly pressing. The sharpening and concretization of panic phenomena cannot be overcome by superficial calmness. The stagnation of factory products is now worse than before, and the closure of factories and shops is also increasing day by day. The increase in the number of unemployed people is enough to worry about social security. As for the industrial, commercial, and financial aspects, the various credit instruments that various industries relied on in the past have now lost their function. The market chips have gradually become exhausted due to lack, and the credit of various industries has also gradually disappeared due to tightening. If the industrial and commercial sectors do not quickly create new credit instruments to replace them, then the difficulties faced by various industries will inevitably be ten or a hundred times greater than today. However, the creation of credit instruments has its objective conditions and cannot be expanded arbitrarily. The only other way for industry and commerce to create and use freely is the commercial acceptance draft. This is not only recognized by most experts but also the inevitable trend of various industries. Now, the silk and other industries have been implementing it for many days, and both buyers and sellers have benefited from it. It is hoped that other industries, after the elaboration and clarification by various experts this time, can quickly promote it, and Qinghua firmly believes that it will be able to achieve the goal of increasing chips and self-reliance. The holding of this lecture series will also be worthwhile."</p>
<p>Zhu's Lecture on Common Sense</p>
<p>Zhu Xinong lectured on commercial acceptance drafts and economic common sense: (1) What is a draft? (2) What is an acceptance draft? (3) What is the purpose of promoting commercial acceptance drafts? (A) Increase market chips; (B) Improve the account system; (4) What are the advantages of commercial acceptance drafts? A. Advantages for sellers: (A) In terms of capital operation: 1. The money will not be stagnant; 2. Capital turnover will be flexible; (B) In terms of cost reduction: 1. The discount rate is lower than any loan, then the seller can reduce costs; 2. There is no amortization of bad debts and loss of interest on outstanding debts, then the seller can reduce costs even more; 3. Reduce the employment of collection personnel, and costs can also be reduced. B. Advantages for buyers: 1. Using commercial acceptance drafts can reduce the cost of the seller, that is, directly reduce their purchase price; 2. There is no need to trade with cash, just use the sale price to pay the bills; 3. After the buyer pays the money on time and the credit is obvious, he can pay a capital and do several times the business; 4. The buyer must accept the bills on time, so he will not purchase goods at will. C. Advantages for the financial industry: 1. Commercial acceptance drafts are highly reliable; 2. The period is not long; 3. Can be re-discounted. D. Advantages for the entire financial market: 1. Adjust the surplus and deficit of finance; 1. Reduce the fluctuation of interest rates; (5) Conclusion.</p>
<p>Wang's Lecture on Law</p>
<p>Wang Xiaowen lectured on the ten legal viewpoints on commercial acceptance drafts: (1) The definition and types of acceptance drafts. The draft issued by the drawer is presented to the drawee by the payee, and the one signed and accepted by the drawee is called an acceptance draft. However, there are drafts accepted by banks and drafts accepted by merchants. The former is called a bank acceptance draft, and the latter is called a commercial acceptance draft. However, no matter what its type, its legal nature is the same. (Refer to Article 49 of the Bills of Exchange Law) (2) The legal view of commercial acceptance drafts. The so-called legal view of commercial acceptance drafts refers to the nature and effect of commercial acceptance drafts in the Bills of Exchange Law. Now, according to the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Law, the characteristics and effects of commercial acceptance drafts are explained separately as follows: A. Commercial acceptance drafts are fully indicative securities. (1) What is a security? Any right on paper is related to the paper itself, that is, the right on paper arises from the creation of the paper, and this kind of paper is a security. (2) What is an indicative security? Indicative securities refer to securities that instruct others to pay money and other things to a third party. In principle, they can be transferred by endorsement (refer to Articles 710 and 716 of the Civil Code), and the exceptions are prohibition of transfer or transfer by delivery (Article 27 and Article 21, Paragraph 4 of the Bills of Exchange Law). (3) What is a complete security? Those who cannot claim rights without the security are complete securities. (Refer to Article 15 and Article 16 of the Bills of Exchange Law) B. Commercial acceptance drafts are not securities of cause. The debtor of a commercial acceptance draft absolutely bears the obligation of a certain amount due to the bill behavior (refer to Article 2 of the Bills of Exchange Law). No matter what the reason is, even if the issuance of the draft is based on illegal behavior, if a third party obtains the draft, there is no deception or malice, or no gross negligence, the debtor shall still be responsible (refer to Article 10 and Article 11 of the Bills of Exchange Law), which is different from civil bills that need to inquire about the cause.) C. Commercial acceptance drafts are formal securities. The issuance of drafts must meet the legal requirements (refer to Article 21 of the Bills of Exchange Law), otherwise, it will be invalid according to law (refer to Article 8 of the Bills of Exchange Law). Therefore, whether the three-linked checks and bank notes issued by our country's money houses are the bills of exchange referred to in the Bills of Exchange Law is worth studying. That is, the commercial acceptance draft format drafted by the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank also has problems in law. D. Commercial acceptance drafts are formal securities, that is, the liability of the debtor is based on the words recorded on the bill (refer to Article 2 of the Bills of Exchange Law). The meaning of its words cannot be changed or supplemented by other evidentiary methods. (3) In addition, there are many legal points related to commercial acceptance drafts, but it is impossible to complete them in a short time today. Now, they are specially listed for amateur research. If you have any questions, you can send them directly to the design department of Taiping Insurance Company, No. 212 Jiangxi Road, and they will be answered in detail. A. Issues of forgery and alteration of bills (Article 13 of the Bills of Exchange Law) B. Issues of signature or record deletion of bills (Article 14 of the Bills of Exchange Law) C. Issues of bill of exchange time limit (Article 19 of the Bills of Exchange Law D. Endorsement issues (Articles 27 to 38 of the Bills of Exchange Law) E. Acceptance presentation issues (Articles 39, 41, 42, and 45 of the Bills of Exchange Law) F. Participation acceptance issues (Articles 55 to 61 of the Bills of Exchange Law) G. Guarantee issues (Articles 50 to 54 of the Bills of Exchange Law) H. Payment and participation in payment issues (Articles 66 to 81 of the Bills of Exchange Law) I. Recourse issues (Articles 81 to 102 of the Bills of Exchange Law) J. Protest issues (Articles 103 to 110 of the Bills of Exchange Law)</p>
<p>Cai's Speech</p>
<p>Cai Chengxin said, "Mr. Luo Qinghua asked me to talk about the situation abroad in the third lecture on acceptance drafts. Recently, because I have been busy with work, I have not had time to make systematic preparations, so let's just talk about it haphazardly. The history of drafts is very long. About 300 years ago, merchants in Venice and Florence, Italy, had already used drafts due to practical needs. The Bills of Exchange Law formulated in the United Kingdom in 1882 has a very clear explanation of commercial acceptance drafts. As for places such as the United States and Canada, the development of acceptance drafts is relatively backward. This method was only available about 110 years ago, but it was not very important. Since the world economic panic in 1929, the market chips have suddenly tightened. Therefore, commercial acceptance drafts are strongly advocated. In terms of numbers, according to approximate estimates, the acceptance of chestnuts for the whole year last year was probably worth 700 to 800 million yuan. In Canada, it is about 100,000 to 200 million yuan. Because the statistical methods in the United Kingdom are incomplete, accurate figures are more difficult to obtain. The above is a general overview of the popularity of acceptance drafts overseas. Our country's current economic situation also needs to promote this method. Therefore, this time, Mr. Luo Xiaohua and others actively advocated it, which is definitely not a blind attempt, but an acceptance of the valuable experience of others. Because under the current situation, the market chips are so lacking, the banking industry cannot but shrink very much for accounts receivable. However, we are unwilling and unwilling to stop the market like this for a long time. Therefore, we can only think of remedial methods to make the silver root looser and the market more lively, in order to overcome this recession. Now we find that commercial acceptance drafts are the most conducive to meeting the current needs, so everyone has the obligation to do their best to promote them. As for the various advantages of acceptance drafts and the methods of implementation, the previous gentlemen have already explained them in detail, and I will not repeat them here."</p>
<h3>National Loan Manufacturers Association Along the Two Railway Lines Will Hold a Mibo National Goods Exhibition: Organizing a Preparatory Committee to be Responsible for Handling It</h3>
<p>The National Goods Factory Federation along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways in this city is an organization of well-known national loan factories in Shanghai, such as Taikang Food Company, Tianchu MSG Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, and Jinglun Knitting Factory. Since its establishment, it has been a year. More than 80 major factories in Shanghai have joined, such as Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory and Nanyang Soap and Candle Factory. The meeting is very developed. The association sees that the city is shrouded in recession, and the products of the factory are stagnating. If you want to break through the shroud of recession, you can only actively promote national goods and open up new sales channels. In view of the fact that Ningbo is one of the five major commercial ports in our country, with a dense population, prosperous business, and a very strong purchasing power of society, it is planned to hold a national goods exhibition in Ningbo in the early autumn season. I once sent a letter to the Yinxian County Government to assist in the process, and the Yinxian County Government approved it and designated the site outside Lingqiaomen as the venue, etc. Through the fourth joint meeting of the executive supervisors of the association, it was resolved to elect Tianchu MSG Factory, Guanshengyuan Food Company, China Chemical Industry Society, Taikang Food Company, China First Knitting Factory, Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Yitai Steel Factory, Liangxinji Toothbrush Factory, Tianyiwei Mother Factory, Jinglun Sweatshirt Factory and other eleven companies as the preparatory committee, organized the Yinxian National Goods Exhibition Preparatory Committee, planned everything and was responsible for handling it.</p>

<h3>The City Received a Timely Rain Yesterday: The Weather Turned Cooler and People's Hearts Tended to Peace: The Hardworking Farmers Were Overjoyed</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the city has been suffering from a long drought for a month. Most people are worried about the return of drought. However, the weather changed drastically yesterday afternoon, and it rained heavily until it stopped at night. The fields and rice paddies recovered slightly, and the farmers were overjoyed. The rice price also shrank after the rain. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Timely Rain</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, there has been a long drought without rain, and the weather has been hot and dry, which is likely to cause a major drought. Yesterday morning, the weather was extremely hot, with the temperature reaching about 90 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the sky was hazy with clouds, making it feel even more sultry. At 12:45 PM, it suddenly drizzled, drifting with the wind. Then, the raindrops gradually increased, and soon water dripped from the eaves until it stopped slightly at 5:45 PM. However, the vaulted clouds were still densely covered, and it still looked like it was going to rain again. Yesterday, the rainfall from noon to night was about three to four inches. As a result, the heat gradually subsided, as if it were cool autumn weather.</p>
<p>Fields and Rice Paddies Recovered Slightly</p>
<p>Since the drought, the cotton fields and rice fields in various districts of the city have shown signs of dryness between the fields. Farmers irrigate day and night, fearing the return of drought. Everyone is worried. After the heavy rain yesterday, although the rainfall failed to realize the ideal desire, this adjustment will be a small supplement to the long-drought fields. Regardless of cotton, rice, and other grains, relying on this natural irrigation, they have recovered slightly. Therefore, the farmers turned their worries into joy. According to the old farmers, yesterday's weather was cloudy, and it is predicted that not only Zhejiang and Shanghai will have rain, but also other provinces in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Rice Price After Rain</p>
<p>The price of rice in Shanghai has been rising continuously since last week due to the dry weather and the difficulty of transportation, which has reduced the source. The No. 1 (i.e., special) rice in the North City has exceeded the price limit set by the municipal government. Other Chen Xian foreign rice and other rice have also risen by more than half a yuan. Yesterday was a weekly holiday, and the market only traded in the morning. By the time the market closed at 12:00 noon, the rice price was still the same as the previous day. However, according to the Soybean and Rice Industry Association Committee Qiang Guisheng, the market situation was stable this morning (i.e., yesterday) and there were no ups and downs. When the heavy rain suddenly fell in the afternoon, the weather turned cooler, and the drought was slightly reduced. People's hearts gradually stabilized. Therefore, it is predicted that the rice price will shrink back when the market opens tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning). If there is more rain to adjust, the autumn harvest will not be damaged.</p>

<h3>Yuan Lianghua Discusses: Peace in Fishing Areas This Year, But Fishermen's Economic Situation is Increasingly Precarious and Worrying; Plans to Continue Renting Two Patrol Ships This Year</h3>
<p>The spring fishing season has almost passed. According to a survey by the fishing industry, this year's catch has been quite abundant, but the poor sales and low fish prices are regrettable. Regarding maritime safety, Yuan Lianghua, director of the Fisheries Protection Office, told reporters yesterday that since the office worked hard to suppress pirates at the end of last year, after the major ringleaders were captured, pirates have been frightened this year and have not dared to be rampant. Even small groups are rarely active, so the sea area is very peaceful. As the cuttlefish season begins, fishing vessels are still densely deployed near the fishing areas to step up protection. However, due to the impact of low fish prices this year, fishermen's economic situation has become more alarming, and the security situation in the second half of the year is particularly worrying. The two patrol ships rented from shipping companies last year were originally scheduled to expire in the fall of this year, so it is planned to continue renting them to increase the strength of the patrol fleet, he said.</p>

<p>The Shanghai French Municipal Council, in view of the occurrence of multiple incidents of mad dogs biting people in the French Concession, in order to prevent the spread of infection, issued a notice by acting Director-General Pediot stating: "Regarding the matter of this notice, as there have been multiple incidents of mad dogs biting people in this concession, this council has taken strict measures to prevent the spread of infection. All dog owners should strictly abide by Article 1 of the council's regulations for managing dogs on the streets. Any dog walking on the street without a muzzle may be arrested by the patrol and detained in the dog pound. If the dog shows symptoms of rabies, it may be killed to prevent transmission. This council hopes that residents in the concession who own dogs will have their dogs vaccinated to prevent rabies. Let this be known to all." Signed by acting Director-General Pediot.</p>
<h3>Short-Clothed Bandits Apprehended on Race Course Road; Fake Gun Too Realistic; Four Bandits Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>The head of the Chengdu Road Patrol Station, believing that theft cases have been frequently heard of late, with robberies on Race Course Road being the most common, ordered detectives to patrol strictly within their jurisdiction. Yesterday at 1:25 PM, detectives Huang Fusen and Bao Shi Guichun from the patrol station saw four men in short clothes walking towards them on Race Course Road. Finding their behavior suspicious, they joined with Chinese Constable No. 1725, Shang Xue, to question them. When the men hesitated and stammered, they were stopped and searched. A fake gun, difficult to distinguish from a real one, was found on one of the bandits. All four were taken to the patrol station. It was learned that the four bandits were named Wang Afu (who had the fake gun), Zhang Zaiqing, Gao Zhenghe, and Zhang Di Yi. The patrol station's lawyer, Qian Jiu, stated the facts of the case to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Special Court, saying that due to time constraints, the patrol station had not yet investigated the four defendants, so he requested permission to detain them. Judge Liu Yugui questioned Wang Afu and the others briefly and ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wang Yin Nian Impersonates Official; Swindles and Deceives Everywhere; Many Official Documents and Letters of Appointment Confiscated; Victims Summoned to Testify</h3>
<p>Wang Jinian, a Ningbo native who previously worked in Nanjing political circles and is now 27 years old, has recently been unemployed, staying in Shanghai at Room 36 of the Xinhua Hotel in Hongyunfang, Huage Street, French Concession. To resolve his issues of food and clothing, he had the wild idea to impersonate the chief of the Jiangsu Salt Affairs District dispatched by the Salt Administration Reform Association of the Executive Yuan, swindling and deceiving money everywhere and issuing letters of appointment. Chen Guangfu, a fellow townsman living on Jisi Feier Road, sought to become the secretary-general. Wang demanded 1,500 yuan for expenses, of which 100 yuan had already been paid. Lin Zhijun and Fei Baolin were each defrauded of $15, and Zhou Peikun was defrauded of $10 in an attempt to secure a minor position. The scheme was discovered by Jin Jiulin, inspector of the French Patrol Station, who dispatched detectives Xu Jinlong, Yin Baoke, and others to Room 36 of the Xinhua Hotel on the previous day, arresting Wang. Confiscated were 181 official document covers of the Salt Administration Reform Association of the Executive Yuan, a bundle of blank letters of appointment, 1,000 envelopes of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Salt Affairs, 500 blank official documents, 19 letters of appointment with various titles filled out in the name of Wang Jinian, district chief, a square seal with the seal script "Salt Administration Reform Association of the Executive Yuan," and three small seals with the names Wang Jinian, Wang Jichun, and Qian Junkui, as well as a glass frame inscribed "Congratulations to Mr. Yinian on his glorious appointment," signed "Lin Bing Respectfully Congratulates." All were taken to the patrol station, and Wang was detained. Chen Guangfu and others who had been defrauded were summoned to the station. The next day, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where Judge Wang Gangxu conducted the preliminary hearing. Lawyer Yuan Jiahan explained the facts of the case and requested a two-week extension for a detailed investigation before filing the indictment. Detective Xu Jinlong reported on the arrest of the defendant and the seizure of evidence, and presented the various forged documents seized. Chen Guangfu and others complained about being defrauded and paying money. Wang Jinian confessed to the charges of impersonation and fraud. The court ordered a postponement until the 26th for further investigation and interrogation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Prostitute Buys Diamond Ring; Pays with a Bounced Check; Jewelry Store Files Lawsuit; Reconciliation at the Trial</h3>
<p>Prostitute Yi Jun, the third oldest, hung up her sign to solicit business at her brothel located at No. 7, Fuzhili, Pingwang Street, Fuzhou Road, last month. In February of this year, she selected a diamond ring worth $200 from Wanyuan Chang Jewelry Store at No. 41, Old Jiaochang, Xinbeimen, and paid with a check. However, when the check was presented for payment, the funds were unavailable. After repeated demands for payment, Liu Qianzeng, the manager of Wanyuan Chang Jewelry Store, filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing Yi Jun of fraud. The lawsuit stated that on February 23 of this year, Yi Jun selected a diamond ring from Wanyuan Chang Jewelry Store, stating that the price was $200. The defendant claimed that she did not have enough cash with her and promised to deliver it the next day. The plaintiff, being familiar with her, did not suspect anything and handed over the ring. However, she never returned. When they repeatedly went to her brothel, Yijun, to demand payment, she always made excuses and claimed that the ring had been pawned, even showing a pawn ticket. The plaintiff originally intended to report her to the authorities, but the defendant repeatedly begged for leniency and promised to find a way to pay. On April 24, she issued a check for $100 from the Ningbo Industrial Bank, but when it was presented for payment, the bank stated that the check had no funds associated with it and was essentially a bounced check, a very deceptive act. Her actions constitute the crime of fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code and should be arrested and punished according to the law. The plaintiff also requested the court to order the defendant to pay $200 in damages. The court approved the filing and scheduled a hearing for the previous day. However, Yi Jun, knowing that she was in the wrong, urgently asked someone to mediate with Liu Qianzeng and quickly returned the money. Liu had already accepted the payment, so when the case opened the previous afternoon, Liu declared that the case had been settled and requested withdrawal. The court ruled that the case would not be heard.</p>

<h3>Two City Councils Held Meeting Yesterday; Relieving Stores on Rongshi Road; Letter to French Municipal Council Urging Swift Relief</h3>
<p>The shops in the Caishi Road area of the French Concession, due to the French Municipal Council constructing roads on that road and piling up soil on the sidewalks in front of the shops to a height of half a zhang, have been unable to leave or even walk into the shops, and during normal times, the ashes and sand fly about. When it rains, there is standing water in front of the door, making it slippery, resulting in the absence of customers. As the market is in extreme depression, the shops are barely able to maintain themselves. With the impact of the current road construction, they all feel that they are sitting around waiting to die. They especially signed their names and sealed the petition to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association and the Fourth and Fifth District Branches of the Shanghai Municipal 1st District Citizens' Association, requesting assistance. The Fourth and Fifth District Branches of the Municipal Association held a joint meeting of committee members at the Anxin Temple, Baire Road, at 4 PM yesterday. The committee members in attendance were Cen Zhiliang, He Yaozhang, Tong Wenli, Ye Ruiqi, Xia Shanxiao Tong Lizhang, Sun Ruiting, Zhang Zhimin, Huang Zhixian, and Xu Yanwu from the Fourth District; and Zhang Qingfa, Fang Bocen, Qian Yuan, Xi Jingyan, Qu Zhenhua, Wu Yunshou, Xu Zixian, Yan Chengxian, Hu Zifang, Zhang Huichang, and Gu Gongda from the Fifth District. Ye Ruizhai was elected chairman. The chairman reported on the letters from the various shops, and after a long discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) The two associations will jointly write a letter to the French Municipal Council, urging them to provide swift relief. (2) The letter will be forwarded to the General Association to quickly seek relief measures. (3) A rent reduction committee will be organized to first distribute rent survey forms and the names of the landlords, and then write to persuade them to voluntarily reduce rents in order to maintain operations. (4) According to the association's investigation report, the construction workers demanded one or two yuan in drinking money from the shops when piling up soil, under the pretext of leaving a passage. The association should report this situation to the French authorities for attention and prompt prevention. Before appropriate relief measures are sought, the workers should be ordered to move the soil to a suitable location in order to facilitate business operations. The above resolutions were announced, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Sanbei Sightseeing Tour; Departing by Land and Water; Celebrating Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Birthday at Longshan</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the 69th birthday of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the owner of Sanbei Company. His friends Jin Tingsun, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yaqin, Mao Haoyuan, and others originally planned to launch a grand birthday celebration. However, Mr. Yu believed that at this difficult time, when it is important to help the overall situation, it is inappropriate to engage in extravagance and firmly refused. The initiators, understanding Mr. Yu's intention, canceled the grand celebration and instead organized a group sightseeing tour to visit Sanbei in Ningbo. Here is a report on the tour's progress:</p>
<p>Departure of the Sightseeing Tour</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th, the first group of the sightseeing tour departed, including Jin Tingsun, Wang Xiaolai, Mao Heyuan, Fan Hengde, Xie Baosheng, You Jusun, and others, a total of more than 40 people. They traveled by car from Shanghai through Hangzhou, crossed Cao'e, and went directly to Longshan. The second group of more than 500 people took the Ningpo steamer to Ningbo in the afternoon of the same day. After arriving in Ningbo, they transferred to cars to Longshan. The third group is scheduled to depart by boat from Shanghai on the 17th, with an estimated number of over 2,000 people.</p>
<p>Celebration at the Yu Residence</p>
<p>Many famous performers are in the sightseeing tour, so it is planned to celebrate the event at the Yu family home on the 17th and 18th in Longshan, to which the theater is attached. The planned performances include "Five Peaks" performed by Gan De, "Xiaoyaojin" performed by Fan Hengde and Xie Baosheng, "Qingshishan" performed by You Jusun and Sun Lanheng, "Battle of Red Cliffs" performed by Zhao Peixin, Guo Xiaoxiao, and Fang Cenyi, "Baishuitan" performed by Jin Yuansheng, "Catching and Releasing Su Tiesui" performed by Wu Jiangfeng and He Liang, "A Complete Circle" performed by Yuan Senzhai and Zhang Wei Ming, and "Visiting the Mother and Returning to the Camp" performed by Li Baishui, Hong Yanbin, Zhu Yanan, and Jin Biyu.</p>
<p>Presenting Commemorative Publication</p>
<p>The initiators, respecting Mr. Yu's wishes, are not engaging in extravagance or sending gifts. However, because Mr. Yu has been operating his business for 60 years, struggling through adversity, and is also enthusiastic about national affairs and courageous in public welfare, his life's work is worthy of admiration by the Chinese people. A special commemorative publication was compiled and printed. The editorial matters were entrusted to the staff of the Shanghai Ningbo Daily. A total of 50,000 copies were printed and distributed to various sectors as a commemoration. The contents include (1) the negotiations between the Siming Public Institute and the French, (2) the case of the riot in the public hall, (3) the origin and end of the establishment of the Chinese team of the International Merchants' Volunteers, (4) the establishment of Siming Bank and the Ning Shao Company, (5) initiating the Industrial Exposition, (6) participating in the Xinhai Revolution, (7) opening Longshan as a port, (8) the Sanbei Company, (9) the May 30th massacre, and (10) joining the Chinese Committee, as well as commemorative texts and a guide to Longshan. There are also many photos of famous scenic spots in Ningbo and Zhenhai.</p>
<p>Shanghai Radio Broadcast</p>
<p>The shipping broadcast station founded by Mr. Yu and the Shanghai Ningbo Daily are cooperating to hold an aerial birthday celebration on his 69th birthday on the 18th. From 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM that afternoon, a special program will be broadcast, with the Moonlight Society members and Ms. Cang Yinqiu singing, and Zhou Jiaoqing and Liang Zhongyuan, representatives of the China Vocational Education Society and the Vocational English Research Society, delivering congratulatory speeches. Jiang Beiping, General Manager of Ningbo Daily, will also speak about Mr. Yu's life story. The program on that day has been negotiated to be rebroadcast by the Li Shude Tang, Yongsheng, Youlian, Zhongxi, Lili, and Xinxin radio stations. The frequencies of the stations are as follows: Shipping XHHM, frequency 980; Li Shude Tang XHHE, frequency 940; Yongsheng XHH, frequency 1080; Zhongxi XHHH frequency 1040; Youlian XHHV, frequency 880; Xinxin XHXC, frequency 780; He XHHN, frequency 1240; Yaxin XLHN frequency 1130; Yuanchang XLHM, frequency 1120.</p>

<h3>Five Countries Send Personnel to China to Investigate Our Country's Currency; Financial Circles in This City Express Welcome</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the governments of the five countries of Britain, America, France, Italy, and Japan have reached an agreement and will each send financial representatives to China to investigate the monetary situation of our country. The British representative has been appointed as Sir Otto Niemeyer, a financial advisor, and the French representative has been appointed as Mr. Renouvin, the financial deputy counselor of the French embassy in Britain. They are expected to begin their journey to China in August. The American, Italian, and Japanese representatives are expected to be announced soon. The financial circles in this city welcome the joint arrival of the financial representatives from various countries to China to investigate the currency. It is also transmitted that when the representatives of various countries come to China to study the currency issue, they will divide the currency into two types, one for domestic use and one for foreign use. The currency for domestic use will still be based on silver, and a new method will be agreed upon for the currency for foreign use. The opinions of the financial circles in various countries on this new method are all based on the technical position of each country. Britain advocates that China's foreign currency should be linked to the pound, France advocates that it should be linked to gold, and the United States advocates that it should be linked to the dollar. Our country's financial circles believe that this matter is very inappropriate. It is hoped that the representatives of various countries will come to China and base their work on our country's national conditions and current situation, and not solely on the technical position of each country.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Work Relief Summary of各省旱災義振會 (Each Province's Drought Relief Association)</h3>
<p>According to Cheng Junsheng, director of the Jiangsu Province investigation and distribution, the 各省旱災義振會 (Each Province's Drought Relief Association) recently reported that Zhu Qicheng and others, work relief director of Jintan County, have reported that he has traveled to the hardest-hit areas in the 5th and 6th districts together with the county magistrate to conduct on-site evaluations of the reservoir locations. He said that the former Qing Dynasty soil administrator, Ke Zhuang, when he was the prefect of Zhenjiang, built many reservoirs that benefited the people of Tan Township. These were recorded in historical records. These reservoirs have all been in disrepair for many years and have been leveled. Now, it is proposed to rebuild these reservoirs to truly benefit the people. Regarding the regulations on the custody of work relief funds in Jiangsu, the staff of this office and the work relief directors of various counties are all unpaid volunteers. The necessary administrative expenses are issued by the association in accordance with regulations. After the work relief funds are received by the investigation and distribution director, they are distributed to the work relief directors of various counties in accordance with the plan, and then transferred to local public organizations for safekeeping. The local public organizations of each county organize a work relief fund custody committee to be responsible for safekeeping and to accept the entrustment of the work relief director. According to the payment vouchers issued by the director, they are issued to the foremen for distribution to the workers. The investigation and distribution director is responsible for the overall work relief in the province, properly planning and supervising the implementation. The work relief directors of various counties are responsible for completely and fundamentally helpful work relief, and the pre-construction work plans must be approved by this office before implementation.</p>
<p>Work Relief Regulations Measurement, mapping, and calculation of earthwork shall be assisted by county government personnel. This office's work relief shall select mountainous areas lacking water, and areas most severely affected by disaster in the county, and recruit disaster workers to open reservoirs for water storage. The number of reservoirs opened shall be determined by the amount of work relief funds in the county. The length, width, depth, and amount of work for each reservoir shall be estimated before construction begins and reported to the association for verification. The price for opening a reservoir in this office is set at 15 cents per cubic meter. The recruitment of disaster workers shall be handled by the district chiefs under the direction of the county government. Each reservoir shall have a foreman who is responsible.</p>
<h3>Chongming Shanghai Association Opposes, Shengshan Sijiao Returning to Zhejiang, Yesterday's Membership Meeting Resolved to Telegraph the Government for Ardent Efforts</h3>
<p>The islands of Shengshan and Sijiao, etc., originally under the jurisdiction of Chongming County, Jiangsu Province, recently have been requested by groups such as the Ningbo Tongxian Association to be placed under the jurisdiction of Dinghai County, Zhejiang Province, by the government. The Chongming Shanghai Association specifically held a membership meeting yesterday, attended by over a hundred people including Tong Xingbai, Yang Zhen, Wang Lemin, Chen Yinchu, Shi Fujiu, Tong Muge, Chen Dongbai, Song An, Xu Peixing, Chen Xiangxin, Zheng Xiong, etc. Yang Zhenzhong presided, with Chen Dongbai as the recorder. It was unanimously decided to telegraph the government for ardent efforts. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Respectfully to Chiang, Chairman of the Wuchang Headquarters; Huang, Minister of the Interior in Nanjing; Chen, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government: We have recently read in the Shanghai newspapers of June 15th that the Ningbo Fellow Association, etc., convened a general meeting on the 2nd of this month and unanimously decided to submit a request to Your Excellencies to transfer the islands of Shengshan, Sijiao, etc., under the jurisdiction of Chongming County, Jiangsu Province, to the jurisdiction of Dinghai County, Zhejiang Province. After reading this, we are extremely perplexed. The islands of Sheng and Si have always been under the jurisdiction of Chongming and have a long history. Moreover, the water of the Yangtze River is clear, and the water of the Qiantang River is turbid, with a clear distinction between the two. This is a natural boundary in terms of topography between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The position of the remaining Si islands is clearly in the Yangtze River, so in terms of topography, it clearly belongs to the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces convened representatives to Beijing for public discussion by the Ministry of the Interior regarding the issue of boundary demarcation. Based on historical and geographical relations, it was resolved to continue to use Huanglong as the focus of the boundary between the two provinces. The case has been finalized and there are no objections. However, not long after, the Ningbo Fellow Association, etc., suddenly wanted to overturn the settlement and change the jurisdiction. This matter concerns the change of provincial boundaries and the overturning of the original plan of the Ministry of the Interior. We respectfully request Your Excellencies to take into consideration the historical geography and other various relations, and to deal with it seriously in order to avoid disputes. This would be greatly appreciated. In this urgent telegram, we await your orders. Chongming Shanghai Association kowtows.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Jiangwan District Office of the National Medical Association</h3>
<p>Since receiving the entrustment from the Shanghai National Medical Association to form the Jiangwan Office, Yan Songtang and others of Jiangwan National Medicine have been actively working hard. They have now rented No. 69 Chunsheng Street as the association's premises. Yesterday (the 15th) a grand opening ceremony was held, attended by twenty to thirty members. The Public Association sent representative Jiang. Guests included Xu Gongyu from Guanghua Pharmaceutical Society, Shen Yaoting from Jiangwan Chongshan Hall, etc. Yan Songtang was elected as the chairman, and Yang Hanzhong as the recorder. The ceremony was performed as usual. The chairman reported the course of events, and the preparatory committee reported on the income and expenditure. Then, the representative of the National Medical Association gave a speech, which was extremely sincere. The guest speakers, Xu Jun from Guanghua Pharmaceutical Magazine and Shen Jun from Chongshan Hall, were both quite earnest. Finally, Yan Songtang was selected as the director, and the director will appoint others to extend invitations. In the evening, they celebrated, clinking glasses and toasting, which was quite a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Cotton Spinning and Weaving Experimental Museum Officially Bids for Construction</h3>
<p>The Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Committee and the National Central Research Institute, in view of the fact that the technology of the mechanical textile industry in our country is backward and the production methods are not known to be improved, which greatly affects the development of agriculture and industry, have jointly formed the Cotton Spinning and Weaving Experimental Museum to actually study its advantages and disadvantages in order to seek improvement. The initial operating cost is 400,000 yuan, of which the Cotton Control Committee will undertake 250,000 yuan, and the Central Research Institute will undertake 150,000 yuan. The museum site has been surveyed and determined to be in the southeast corner of the Central Research Institute on Billy Nan Road, covering an area of 15 mu, with a value of approximately 70,000 yuan. The housing part has been planned by architect Dong Dayou as a completely new type of factory building. The cost is set at 90,000 yuan, and bidding was officially opened yesterday. After the decision is made, construction can begin. All the complete set of machines are purchased from countries such as Britain and Germany, with a value of approximately 200,000 yuan. Instruments and books are approximately 40,000 yuan. The annual recurring expenses are entirely borne by the Central Research Institute. Its organizational system is the same as that of the Central Research Institute, that is, researchers, assistant researchers, clerks, etc., are established under the director. The candidate for the director has been decided to be concurrently held by Zhou Zijin, the director of the Engineering Experiment Institute of the Central Research Institute. Currently, one professional technician and four researchers have been hired. In the future, the scope of work of the museum will focus on the improvement of the textile industry, the improvement of quality, and the improvement of technology, and will replace domestic textile and dyeing factories in studying their shortcomings and conducting various practical experiments. In the spring of this year, the Cotton Control Committee specially sent Li Zhuangshoujun to Japan to study the situation of the Japanese textile industry so that they could learn from it in the future.</p>
<h3>Municipal Farmers Association Requests the Ministry of Industry to Reward Domestic Pyrethrum, Dependence on Foreign Lands in the Past Was a Huge Loss, Promoting Planting to Benefit Farmers' Income</h3>
<p>The Municipal Farmers Association yesterday submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to reward the domestic "Samsung Chrysanthemum" insecticide invented by the China Chemical Industry Society in order to promote it. The original text said, "In order to request the award of domestic pyrethrum 'Samsung Chrysanthemum' to demonstrate promotion and save losses, please review this matter. Since the Austrian discovery of pyrethrum in 1506, which has the function of killing insects, countries have competed to plant it. Japan and the United States export more than 10 million yuan worth of it every year. Our country also relies on foreign countries, and the losses are huge. In view of this, the China Chemical Industry Society of this city has created farms since the sixth year of the Republic of China, engaged in trial planting. Over the past eighteen years, after several improvements, the farm area has increased to more than 300 mu, focusing on selecting seeds, cultivating seedlings, and signing contracts with farmers to cooperate and promote planting, sparing no effort. It also held grand ceremonies in the early summer of the twenty-second and twenty-fourth years to entertain people from all walks of life to visit. Mayor Wu of this city personally attended the meeting and awarded the name 'Samsung Chrysanthemum' to show promotion. I think that the company, as a private enterprise, in order to seek the popularity of new crops, does not hesitate to make huge sacrifices. Its spirit and ambition are really commendable. It is definitely not the same as those who only care about quick success and instant benefits. The total annual consumption in the farm is no less than several thousand yuan. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt, if the planting of 'Samsung Chrysanthemum' can be promoted and popularized, it seems to be a small supplement to the income of farmers. It is hoped that this will help to prevent losses. Thinking about this, I would like to ask the Ministry to issue an order to commend and promote it, so that the people of the whole country will naturally follow the government's promotion and widely plant it.

<h3>Xu Tiefeng's Destiny Divination and Fortune-telling Responds to the World</h3>

In recent years, his name has been known at home and abroad. Mr. Xu is knowledgeable and versatile. In addition to military, criminal, political, and educational affairs, he has a lot of experience in the study of fate, fortune-telling, and divination. During his time as a staff member of General Wu Peifu's mansion, people from all directions knew of his magic. Compared to the difficult times, there are many who have no way to go astray. Friends advised him that in his spare time, it is better to talk a little about good and bad luck, so that the world's first human heart will not be without benefit. Mr. Jun also enjoys this and is tireless, so since setting up the writing desk, the threshold has been worn through several times. Mr. Xu is upright and unyielding, and judges directly based on reason. Those who come to talk are shocked and satisfied when they leave. Moreover, although those who have gone there have heard of his name, they have no way to ask for a way. Now he has publicly explained the method, so they are all happy to listen to his high theory, so as to quickly resolve their concerns. The writing desk is located in the Sumingli Shuzhai at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Liban Road, and there is no fate-telling signboard, which is also different from the popular custom.</p>

There are already many kinds of ordinary applied books, newspapers, magazines, etc. Some of them were sent or borrowed by comrades such as Liao Weiming, Hong Jingchi, and Zheng Wenyu. In the future, if the economic situation is good, they will be purchased one after another. It is hoped that all comrades will forgive and support. Furthermore, now the municipal government is promoting the establishment of literacy schools to treat the people's blindness. The establishment of this reading room will allow people to learn from each other and ask each other difficult questions, so that those who are literate can increase their knowledge, and those who are illiterate can also become literate, which is a real need of the times. It is hoped that all comrades and members will often come to read newspapers and books in their spare time, so that they can know the affairs of the world without leaving their homes, so that they can be upright in the world in the future. If they can do this, they will not fail to establish the purpose of this reading room. After discussing the motions, (omitted) the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Blacksmith</h3>
<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>Ding dong... Ding ding dong...</p>
<p>Bare-chested, the strong arms bulged with hard chestnut flesh. Gripping the heavy iron hammer, hitting the red iron again and again, sparks flew like golden stars, the brilliance of life!</p>
<p>They are blacksmiths, young, brave, standing up to do it all day long, exchanging their sweat for white rice! Although blood and sweat soak their bodies, and flames scorch their skin, they have no sighs, no sorrows!</p>
<p>They grow up in a world of iron and fire, in the breath of coal and smoke. Their whole bodies are dark, their eyes are full of red tendons, and their hairy bare legs are wrapped in burlap bags to resist the invasion of sparks. Near them, a pair of great iron-melting furnaces is burning, grinning and opening its blood-red mouth. Greedily and tirelessly devouring large chunks of coal, the long nose spewing hot air, filling the entire low house.</p>
<p>From morning to dusk, night to dawn, they keep on, keep on beating iron; ding ding dong, ding ding dong, forever echoing that simple, loud tune!</p>
<h3>Concubines and Oxen</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>In common sense, the first wife is the domestic helper, and the concubine is the man's sexual instrument, the rich man's toy, entertainment item, decoration, and they themselves are parasites. Enjoyers! It is well known that there are many falsehoods, and there is so-called ironclad evidence!</p>
<p>In my hometown, there is a countryman named Zhu, who originally worked as a rent runner (that is, he was sincerely hired by the landlord to collect rent on his behalf in the countryside); several families in the town who owned fields in Xixiang entrusted him to collect them along the way. He obtained the due remuneration from the employer, and was able to report less and more to collect the reimbursement of food and accommodation expenses from each owner, and he could also get a little commission when the owner had land sales and purchases. Over the years, he gradually accumulated a well-off family from a poor man.</p>
<p>After the annual harvest season, he set off to run rent in the Xixiang area. This is the identity, authority, and self-respect of the landlord's representative, which makes the tenants awe him. When he encounters food and lodging, he naturally instructs the tenants to provide them without having to spend money. Later, for several years in a row, he selected palace girls from the farmers and brought five or six strong young girls back to his home as his concubines.</p>
<p>Zhu had a thin foundation of fields and acres in his hometown. When he brought so many concubines home, he assigned them to agricultural work one by one, ploughing the mud, transplanting rice, carting water, weeding, harvesting. The workers cooperated and were able to command as they wished, greatly increasing the output. He often exaggerated his brilliant calculations in front of people: "I keep these women, just like a few plowing oxen, but I don't need to spend money to buy oxen. They can do the same work as plowing oxen, and they are more intelligent than plowing oxen and are willing to listen. Even if you compare them to hired workers in the fields, you can save a lot of wages, and everyone will protect the family wholeheartedly. As for the fun of the boudoir, the heat is just as good!"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhu, who was the most scheming, gradually contracted atrophy and can no longer get out of bed. Seeing that the crowd of women are crowding each other, and the sounds of chickens crowing and dogs barking can be heard every day, they let the field work be abandoned, which has been in short supply for a long time, and there is no way to clean it up! As a result, he made himself a plow ox's plow ox, and finally could not handle it!</p>
<h3>Social Sanatorium Cries for Food</h3>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fourteen: A Different Enlightenment: A Westerner Discusses Construction; A Poor Scholar Plants Seeds of Love</p>
<p>But with Beihai walking around here, Zhiqian's interest was piqued, anticipating some action to follow. He continued to hold the door, peeking outside. Sure enough, after a short while, Beihai turned around and came back to the doorway. He stood with his hands behind his back, one foot extended at an angle, his eyes looking towards Aunt Hu's house. For about five minutes, he didn't move his feet. Then, he raised his head to look at the evening glow in the sky, and then turned his head to look around at the houses and gates in the alley, moving his feet west for about twenty steps. When he walked, his steps were very slow. But when he turned around, he quickly returned to the original spot. Once there, he did nothing but look up, then turn his head to look at both ends of the alley. He didn't pay much attention to Aunt Hu's house across the street, only glancing at it occasionally. It was at this moment that Zhu Yueying flashed by in the courtyard across the street, immediately entering the house, but she came out again in less than a minute. Looking at her, she seemed to have something very heavy on her mind. She leaned against the wall, walking with her head down. When she reached her gate, she first put a finger in her mouth. At that time, her eyes were naturally looking down. There was a young scholar standing across the street, but she didn't seem to see him. Beihai's attitude was exactly the same, very casual, not paying attention to the girl coming out across the street. Yueying reached the gate and finally took her finger out of her mouth. Then, she held onto the doorframe with both hands, looked up at the sky, and said to herself: "Who says it looks like it's going to rain? The weather is very nice." (241)</p>
<h3>The Fragrant Memoirs of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At that time, it was Li Lianying's turn to serve again. He first took out a specially made horn and blew it three or four times. Thus, the two small boats, equipped with stoves and already prepared with wine and dishes for the Empress Dowager, quickly rowed closer, one on the left and one on the right, docking on either side of the imperial boat. Then, the people on the imperial boat brought out two specially prepared gangplanks and placed them between the large boat and the small boats. The eunuchs then busily walked back and forth on the gangplanks, preparing to start bringing out the Empress Dowager's lunch.</p>
<p>Today, perhaps because they were afraid of things rolling, breaking, or sinking into the lake on the boat, all the dishes were made of gold or silver. Only the chopsticks used by the Empress Dowager were still the same jade chopsticks she used every day, not changed. As for the eunuchs carrying the dishes, because the space on the boat was narrow, it was inconvenient to run around, so they had to imitate the method used on the train last time, lining up in two very organized rows, one on the left and one on the right, all the way from the gangplanks to the two small boats on either side. All the dishes were then passed up one by one. However, the eunuchs all temporarily covered their hands with a clean white cloth to prevent their fingers from directly touching the Empress Dowager's food. The number of dishes was still a hundred as usual, not reduced by even a bit. But because the tables on the boat were much smaller after all, and there really wasn't enough space, they had to put a few cold dishes and desserts on the table first, and let the remaining ones be held by the eunuchs for the time being. Fortunately, each bowl and plate was covered with a lid, so that the food inside could be kept at its original temperature. The Empress Dowager chewed on the few dishes that were served first while talking to me. I also tried my best to entertain her, hoping to keep her happy throughout. (341)</p>
<h3>A History of Lamps</h3>
<p>— (Xian Fa)</p>
<p>In ancient times, light was obtained by bundling grass or weaving bamboo into torches, and there was nothing called a lamp. Later, when oil was discovered, there were oil lamps and candles. After kerosene was discovered, there were kerosene lamps. After gas was discovered, there were gas lamps. Today, everyone can use electric lamps.</p>
<p>Lamps originated six hundred years before the Common Era. Shells, bones, and fruit shells were used as lamps, burning vegetable oil or animal fat. From two hundred years before the Common Era to three hundred years after, clay lamps were used, commonly known as early clay lamps. From three hundred to one thousand years, colored ceramic lamps were used, all burning vegetable oil. From one thousand to one thousand six hundred years, copper lamps were used, burning olive oil. From one thousand six hundred to one thousand eight hundred years, Berta lamps were used, burning fat oil. From one thousand eight hundred to one thousand eight hundred and fifty years, candles began to be used. From one thousand eight hundred and fifty to one thousand eight hundred and seventy years, Confin lamps were used. In one thousand eight hundred and seventy years, kerosene lamps were used again. In one thousand eight hundred and ninety years, carbon lamps were used. In one thousand nine hundred and ten years, Marilda lamps were used. In one thousand nine hundred and twenty years, white Marilda lamps were used. In one thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven years, internal milky electric lamps were used.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be divided into three major periods. Before six hundred years before the Common Era, it can be called the torch period. Afterwards, it was the oil lamp period. After one thousand eight hundred and ninety years, it can be called the electric lamp period. This is a rough outline of the world's lamp history.</p>
<p>Local Customs Sketches</p>
<h3>Talking About the Buddhist Scriptures Stored in Longhua Temple</h3>
<p>— Shanghai Communication Society</p>
<p>Yesterday, all the Shanghai newspapers carried a piece of news about Longhua Temple organizing the Ming Dynasty Wanli Emperor's bestowed Tripitaka. Because Longhua Temple is in Shanghai, we, who are studying Shanghai's position, feel that we can no longer remain silent upon seeing that "barbarian head" style of news.</p>
<p>If you flip through the county chronicles of the Qing Dynasty's Kangxi, Qianlong, Jiaqing, and Tongzhi reigns, there are the same records about Longhua Temple being granted a Tripitaka during the Ming Dynasty's Wanli reign. They roughly say: At that time, the emperor issued an edict granting Buddhist scriptures to famous mountains. The abbot of Longhua Temple, the monk Da Guo, petitioned for it to be granted, and received the emperor's permission. He specially sent a eunuch to the temple to bestow the Tripitaka in seven hundred and eighteen cases, and also bestowed a golden ring and purple robes to Da Guo for protecting the scriptures. However, if you flip through the Continued Chronicle of Shanghai County, it also says that in the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1874), a Tripitaka was requested, which the so-called Longhua Temple's reviving founder, the monk Guan Zhu, received from the ministry. In Zi Tao's "Miscellaneous Records of Ying Yuan," it was also said: "...In the summer of Jiaxu, the abbot Guan Zhu received the Tripitaka from the ministry, prepared ceremonial guards to welcome it, with about a hundred monks escorting it. After the war, the Buddhist teachings flourished day by day, and this is its sign." From this, we can know that Longhua Temple has had two Tripitakas one after another. Then the fact must be turned to the topic above, is the Tripitaka that Longhua Temple is organizing the one bestowed during the Ming Dynasty's Wanli reign? Or the one bestowed during the Qing Dynasty's Tongzhi reign? According to the abbot Xing Kong's determination, it is undoubtedly the one bestowed during the Ming Dynasty. And the Dharma Master Mantuo, who was invited by Xing Kong and who had organized the Tripitaka in Huayan Temple in Chongqing, also did not deny it. The news was published that way, and the readers believed it that way. However, according to the research results of our Shanghai Communication Society, the Tripitaka currently in Longhua Temple is definitely not the Ming Dynasty Wanli edition, but the "Long Tripitaka edition" bestowed during the Qing Dynasty's Tongzhi reign. Now we can write down some of the research results:</p>
<p>According to the Dharma Master Mantuo's preliminary organization of the Tripitaka, he said that the entire Tripitaka has thirteen volumes per case, excluding the table of contents, with a total of seven hundred and thirty cases. Upon inspection, there are three hundred and fifty-nine complete cases, three hundred and nineteen incomplete cases, and fifty-three completely lost cases. In terms of the number of cases, if it is the Ming Dynasty Wanli edition, then according to the county chronicle's record, it should be seven hundred and eighteen cases, but now there are seven hundred and thirty cases excluding the table of contents, which shows that it is definitely not the Ming Dynasty Wanli edition but the Long Tripitaka edition, because the total number of the Long Tripitaka edition is seven hundred and thirty-five cases. This is one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the format. The Ming Dynasty Wanli edition of the Tripitaka was initiated by the two Chan masters Mi Zang and Huan Yu in the seventeenth year of the Shenzong Wanli reign (1589). At that time, the great masters Ganshan Zibo, as well as Yuan Liaofan, Feng Mengzhen, and others vigorously supported it, and the printing was done at Jing Mountain Lengyan Temple. It took decades to complete the printing. The style at that time was a square-bound style. As for the Long Tripitaka edition, it was printed from the thirteenth year of the Qing Dynasty's Shizong Yongzheng reign (1735) to the third year of the Gaozong Qianlong reign (1738), using the "Northern Tripitaka edition" as a draft. The format is Sanskrit-style, with five lines per page, the same as the Shu edition format. The Shanghai Communication Society reporter has also seen the Tripitaka in Longhua Temple now. It is indeed Sanskrit-style and only has five lines per page, so it is determined that it is not the one bestowed during the Ming Dynasty Wanli reign, but the one bestowed during the Qing Dynasty Tongzhi reign. This is two.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the history of Longhua Temple itself, according to the records of the Tongzhi County Chronicle and the Miscellaneous Records of Ying Yuan, Longhua Temple was destroyed when the Taiping army attacked Shanghai in the tenth year of the Xianfeng reign (1860). Regarding the Tripitaka bestowed during the Ming Dynasty, although it does not state that it was also destroyed, it also does not say that it was not destroyed. So, according to our current guess, unless the abbot of Longhua Temple received the news in advance and moved the Tripitaka away; otherwise, it would be that the monks valued the Buddhist scriptures so much that they were willing to sacrifice their lives and return to the Western Paradise with the Buddhist scriptures. In the meantime, they desperately carried the Tripitaka to escape, but even if they carried it, would it be possible to carry that many volumes? Therefore, we can know that the Tripitaka bestowed during the Ming Dynasty Wanli reign was mostly burned at that time; and the one now is the one bestowed during the Qing Dynasty Tongzhi reign.</p>
<p>Finally, the Shanghai Communication Society greatly admires Abbot Xing Kong's actions in organizing the Tripitaka; but we hope that the history will not be mistaken, turning into what Shanghai people call "selling barbarian heads"!</p>

Henan plans to set up 4,400 short-term primary schools in a ten-year plan, and the funding has also been arranged.</p>
<h3>Guizhou Province Promotes Compulsory Education Plan</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Guiyang, 14th) The Department of Education received an order from the Ministry of Education on the 13th, instructing it to draft measures for promoting compulsory education, consult with the chairman of the province, and report to the Ministry by the 14th of this month, as a standard for the central government to allocate compulsory education funds. After receiving the order, the Department of Education immediately planned to set up short-term primary schools in the province and raise funds. According to the plan, a total of 850 short-term schools will be set up throughout the province, requiring a total of 212,500 yuan. The plan has been submitted to the provincial government for review.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Promulgates and Implements; Key Points of Specific Measures for Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education plans to promote compulsory education starting in the 24th year of the Republic of China. In addition to the Outline of Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education, which has been promulgated by the Executive Yuan and issued to the competent authorities of various provinces and cities, requiring them to properly draft implementation plans and submit them for record, the Ministry also announced the detailed rules for the implementation of the outline on the 15th of this month. These detailed rules are a concrete plan for the promotion of compulsory education and are of utmost importance. Yesterday, this newspaper briefly described it. Now, the main points are recorded below.</p>
<p>1. Short-term primary schools shall explicitly stipulate the exemption of tuition fees and enrollment fees. Those located in rural areas may have holidays during the busy farming season to facilitate farming operations.</p>
<p>2. Enact compulsory enrollment laws. In areas where the local primary schools are sufficient to accommodate local school-age children, all healthy school-age children should be supervised to enroll. If they do not enroll, their parents or guardians should be persuaded to enroll them. Those who do not heed the persuasion may have their names posted publicly. If they still do not comply, they may be fined from one to five yuan. However, those who have illnesses or other reasons may request exemption from school with a certificate. The fines will still be used for compulsory education.</p>
<p>3. Preparations. Each locality should divide school districts, investigate school-age children, plan school locations, and raise funds. Compulsory education committees should be organized at the central, provincial, municipal, and county levels to provide planning.</p>
<p>4. First phase of compulsory education implementation. From the 24th year of the Republic of China to the 28th year, is the period for popularizing one year of compulsory education. At the beginning of this period, each province and city should delineate school districts and widely set up one-year short-term primary schools in each school district, adopting a two-part system, enrolling older out-of-school school-age children aged nine to twelve, so that they receive one year of compulsory education. In addition to being set up independently, these primary schools may also be attached to other primary schools and public institutions. The required school buildings may make full use of public offices, ancestral halls, or rented private houses. If there is nothing to use, extremely simple sheds may be temporarily built. In addition, ordinary primary schools should also be moderately increased, a part of the ordinary primary schools should be required to adopt a two-part system, and the enrollment of existing primary schools should be strengthened. Private schools in various places should be forced to change their curriculum according to the short-term primary school curriculum and be renamed improved private schools. Circuit teaching should be tried out in remote areas, so that at least 80% of the total number of school-age children have received more than one year of compulsory education or ordinary primary school education during these five years.</p>
<p>5. Second phase of implementation. From the 29th year of the Republic of China to the 33rd year, is the period for popularizing two years of compulsory education. The one-year short-term primary schools in each province and city should be gradually changed to three-year short-term primary schools, enrolling out-of-school children aged eight to twelve, so that they receive two years of compulsory education. Other measures implemented in the first phase should continue to be implemented, so that at least 80% of the number of school-age children have received two years of compulsory education or ordinary primary school education.</p>
<p>6. Third phase of implementation. Starting from the 34th year of the Republic of China, in addition to the other measures of the first phase continuing to be implemented, the year-long primary schools in various places should be gradually changed to four-year ordinary primary schools.</p>
<p>7. Fundraising. In addition to the central government's discretionary subsidies, each province and city should also take into account local conditions, either by allocating funds from the provincial and municipal education funds and the provincial and municipal general revenue, or by designating special funds for this purpose. Counties and cities should designate school property or other funds for this purpose according to local conditions.</p>
<p>8. Agencies at all levels. The central government is in charge of the Ministry of Education and organizes the National Compulsory Education Committee to assist in the implementation. The provinces and cities are in charge of the competent educational administrative agencies and organize the provincial, municipal, and county compulsory education committees to assist in the promotion and supervise the use of compulsory education funds.</p>
<p>9. Teacher training. The implementation of compulsory education in various provinces and cities and the promotion of short-term primary schools require many teachers. Short-term primary school teacher training classes should be widely set up in provincial and municipal or county junior middle schools and normal schools, enrolling students with junior middle school graduation qualifications for training. During the first phase, those with clear writing and good reasoning and rich common sense may also be recruited to serve as short-term primary school teachers to meet urgent needs. In addition, each county should set up private school teacher training classes to improve private school teachers. Each province and city should also promote normal schools, simplified normal schools, simplified normal departments, etc., to cultivate primary school teachers.</p>

<p>Declaration of Establishment</p>
<p>Draft of the China Children's Culture Association Declaration: In our country, children have always been forgotten. They are appendages of adults, playthings of adults. They have no freedom, no education. What adults give them is one: beating, two: deception, three: teaching them to completely submit and be slaves. The rich sons and daughters enjoy happiness at home, as playthings. Some study books in a pile of books. The poor raise cattle and work for others, wander the streets, and are little beggars. Otherwise, they are sold or abandoned by their parents. What adults give children is a cruel world, a world of slaves, a world of deception, a world of terror. However, the government has now officially announced that Children's Year will begin on August 1st of this year, and has formulated measures to protect children. From now on, this world belongs to children. We want to break the world created by adults and liberate children, especially liberating their hands and brains, to create a new children's world. In the children's world, there is only justice and no cruelty, only freedom and no oppression, only creation and no inheritance, only people among people and no people above people. It is a world of freedom, equality, mutual assistance, and self-defense. This world does not belong to a few children, but to the masses of children. We must not only care for this part and forget that part. We who are purely serving children's culture should unite and strive for this new culture. We are not building well for children to enjoy happiness, but transforming into a part of the children's world to participate in this work. We are a living cell in the children's world, helping the children's world grow. The work we need to do now is to promote all children's cultural construction, study all children's problems, study children's education, create children's science, children's literature, children's art, improve children's health, improve children's entertainment, and so on. At present, on the one hand, we will re-evaluate all the old children's culture, and on the other hand, create the most rationalized children's culture in the children's world. This is our declaration.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Financial Industry's Subsequent Awakening</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingshi</p>
<p>The financial industry essentially exists to regulate the financial turnover deficiencies in various industrial and commercial sectors, indirectly assisting in the prosperity of various industries, thereby achieving a collective path towards overall economic prosperity. Therefore, as industry and commerce become more developed, the need for financial turnover increases, and the financial business becomes more prosperous. Thus, the financial industry becomes more prosperous due to the prosperity of industry and commerce, and more consolidated due to the development of industry and commerce. Conversely, industry and commerce, through the various assistance of the financial industry and the convenience of capital flow, can further develop various industries, and even the entire social economy benefits directly and indirectly. From this, the great contribution of the financial industry to the development prospects of industry and commerce is evident; at the same time, the concern of industry and commerce for the prosperity of the financial industry is also evident. The two are mutually beneficial and indispensable. If industry and commerce lack the financial support of the financial industry, progress is difficult. It is also a practical impossibility for the financial industry to detach itself from industry and commerce and exist and prosper independently. Therefore, the two can prosper together only by coexisting. During periods of economic panic, the two should cooperate closely to plan properly in order to break the deadlock. Otherwise, both sides will inevitably suffer heavy losses, which can be asserted. However, in recent years, industry and commerce have been affected internally by rural bankruptcy and externally by the global economic recession, the situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and is declining daily. The financial industry is also feeling difficult to cope with due to the sluggishness of domestic industrial and commercial sectors, and at the same time threatened by the US silver policy. As a result, the financial industry, which previously specialized in rescuing and regulating the capital of various industries, had to make great efforts to tighten up, resulting in a situation where it was not only unable to save others, but even unable to save itself. The closure and bankruptcy of money shops and banks in various places last year fully demonstrates the deepening of the economic panic, and the financial crisis is following industry and commerce. This seriousness deserves our attention. Now, let's list the financial institutions that have suspended operations in various places:</p>

<p>Shenyang  1  300,000  Too many loans, unable to recover</p>
<p>Taiyuan  1  50,000  Not specified</p>
<p>Dinghai  2  30,000  Shareholder debts, empty assets</p>
<p>Jinhua  3  61,600  Difficult to recover loans, insufficient turnover</p>
<p>Shanghai  8  2,038,000  Bad debts and real estate losses, weak assets</p>
<p>Pinghu  2  Not specified  Market decline, years of losses</p>
<p>The above list only concerns money shops, and already 113 have ceased operations, with a total capital of about 10 million yuan. Looking at the banks that have failed in various places, such as the China Savings Bank, Wuhua Bank, China Industrial Bank, Jiande Bank, Wing On Silver Company, Oriental Trust Company, Overseas Chinese Trust Company, Huadong Bank, Jia Hua Bank, Tong Yi Bank, Xiamen Commercial Savings Bank, Anhui Bank, Jiaxing Commercial Savings Bank, and recently the Minghua Commercial Savings Bank and the foreign-owned American Feng Bank, etc. Since 1930, more than 30 have suspended operations, with a capital of more than 30 million yuan! In addition to the exceptions mentioned above, omissions are inevitable. If there were accurate surveys and statistics, it would undoubtedly be even more impressive. If we analyze the reasons for the closures, they are nothing more than weak capital, insufficient turnover, speculative failures, real estate mortgage losses, too many bad debts, and withdrawals, etc. Industry and commerce are inevitably in a state of collapse due to the termination of assistance. Therefore, in recent years, news of industrial and commercial bankruptcies has been constantly coming, and it is truly chilling! However, in this critical situation, we cannot but raise the following questions. That is, will the financial industry listen to the natural trends, seeking only current survival, and even not hesitate to separate from industry and commerce! Will industry and commerce also drastically tighten up and not seek to struggle? If this is the case, both sides will suffer heavy losses, which is undeniable. To break this deadlock, the financial industry must shoulder this heavy responsibility, and the financial industry must pay attention to the following points.</p>
<p>First, from the perspective of money shops, the reasons for their bankruptcy can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Weak capital: The capital of most money shops is mostly between 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and up to 100,000 yuan. May I ask, can tens of thousands of yuan of funds meet the needs of society? Even if it can be dealt with, it must be turned over quickly to avoid worries. A slight stagnation will reveal flaws. If tens of thousands of yuan of funds are concentrated on a few targets, once there is a risk, there is also the risk of being affected and going bankrupt. Therefore, money shops in the future should cooperate, concentrate capital, and increase their strength. This is one point.</p>
<p>2. Stagnant accounts: When money shops lend money, they often focus on people as the object, and ignore material credit. This point is psychologically welcomed by society. However, in the modern society, there are many complex careers, which are by no means as simple as in the past. Moreover, in the midst of economic turmoil, there are dangers lurking everywhere. If the object of the loan encounters an unfortunate event, and the loan has no corresponding collateral to compensate, then the money shop itself will immediately be shaken. This point should be urgently noted in terms of loan granting to avoid danger. This is the second point.</p>
<p>3. Poor organization: The organization of money shops is mostly limited to the old style. For example, if investors agree with each other for a moment, they will contribute funds to form a group. Once the benefits are not evenly distributed, they will often hinder each other. Not only will the business be affected, but the business itself will also face a crisis. Moreover, the purpose of the organization is mostly only to obtain profits, and does not consider how to expand and how to serve the society. Therefore, money shops that have been around for decades "remain the same." From this, it can be seen that the money industry has shallow vision and weak initiative. Imperfect organization further hinders business operations. This is the third point that should be noted.</p>
<p>The above three points are for money shops. Next, the following points should also be realized by banks:</p>
<p>1. Excessive concentration of business: According to the 1933 Bank Yearbook, there are 146 head offices and 891 branch offices of banks nationwide, totaling 1,038. Among them, the nine cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, Chongqing, Hankou, and Guangzhou have a total of 95 head offices, accounting for 65% of the total, and 311 branch offices, accounting for 30% of the total. The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have the most, with a total of 24 head offices, accounting for 16% of the total, and 182 branch offices, accounting for 18% of the total. From this, it can be seen that the development of banks in my country is clearly biased towards urban and coastal provinces. Since the banking business is concentrated in the same area, the investment path must become narrow. Those with weak capital are often overwhelmed by those with strong capital, and they have no choice but to tend towards speculation in order to obtain profits. This creates an excess of banks and increases panic. This is one point.</p>
<p>2. Excessive uniformity of investment: The current investment paths of banks tend to be uniform. For example, if Bank A thinks that a certain industry is profitable, Bank B will also imitate it. As a result, loans are excessively granted, and once there is a risk, everyone suffers. Or, for emerging industries with promising prospects, which urgently need funds, they hesitate to move forward. The inability of industry and commerce in our country to prosper due to this kind of environment is very common. Moreover, even if the amount of the loan is not large, they refuse to consider it, and do not ask about the future of the industry, and do not accept it at all. They would rather invest the capital that could be used for production in places of extravagance. This is truly puzzling, and it is not the attitude that the financial industry should have in serving, nor is it the original intention of the financial industry to support social industries. Small-capital industrial and commercial enterprises may not have weaker credit than large enterprises, and the future of small-capital industrial and commercial enterprises may not be able to achieve development one day. Moreover, the amount is smaller, and it is more convenient to take out and redeem loans, the risk is lighter, and the degree of profit accumulation is no less than that of large loans. The financial industry should pay close attention to this. This is the second point.</p>
<p>3. Small-capital banks should merge: Most of the reasons for the bankruptcy of various banks are due to weak capital, which leads to temporary insufficient turnover. Therefore, it can be seen that it is not easy for small banks to stand. Because the capital is not large, it is difficult to gain the trust of customers psychologically, and in terms of absorbing deposits, they have to use high interest rates as a slogan, hoping to compete with larger banks. At the same time, in terms of the way out for funds, they naturally have to obtain better profits. In this time of economic depression, productive industries are of course unable to bear the exploitation, so they have to turn to speculation, or proceed regardless of the size of the risk, only seeking generous interest. Once they fail, they cannot but be sacrificed as a result. The intangible is nothing more than increasing the degree of panic. Therefore, I deeply feel that, under the current circumstances, are we only seeking to increase the number of banks to decorate the market? Or are we seeking to enrich the quality to maintain industry and commerce? The greatest need at present is naturally the latter. Therefore, I earnestly hope that the financial industry itself will gather most of the small capital and become several strong and powerful capital. In terms of business, it can naturally avoid the danger of being squeezed, and at the same time, it is easy to gain social trust. In the future, the factors of panic can also be reduced a lot. This is the third point.</p>
<p>In addition to the above points, there is also a common problem in the financial industry, which is the excessively high interest rates. This not only puts great constraints on industry and commerce, preventing them from developing as much as possible; the financial industry itself is also subject to many obstacles. Therefore, in the future, under the conditions of mutual cooperation, interest rates should be reduced urgently. If the interest rate is reduced on the deposit side, the interest rate on loans can also be reduced. As a result, industry and commerce can also avoid a lot of harsh burdens; and gradually have the opportunity to recover and revive. The revival of industry and commerce in the financial industry is indirectly the expansion of the way out for legitimate investment! Undoubtedly, under this condition of mutual cooperation, the degree of economic panic can easily be transformed from deepening to prosperity!</p>
<h3>Preventing Drought</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaochen</p>
<p>China, plagued by frequent natural disasters and man-made calamities, after each devastating and painful catastrophe, the entire country invariably trembles with the fear of the recurrence of misfortune, but as time passes and the situation changes, it is forgotten in the blink of an eye, and no one has ever seen preventive measures taken to prevent harm from occurring and eliminate harm invisibly. Take waterlogging and drought as examples. They occur almost every year, which is evident. The severity of the drought and famine last summer opened up a severe phenomenon unseen in sixty years. The affected provinces included as many as eleven provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Gansu, Guizhou, and Shanxi, totaling 635 counties. The affected area was 329 million mu, accounting for 47% of the cultivated land area of the eleven provinces. According to post-event estimates, the losses in terms of quantity were: 216 million dan of rice, 31.2 million dan of sorghum, 25 million dan of corn, 40 million dan of millet, 6 million dan of cotton, and 31.6 million dan of soybeans; in terms of value: rice was worth 684 million yuan, sorghum was worth 72 million yuan, corn was worth 67 million yuan, soybeans were worth 129 million yuan, cotton was worth 199 million yuan, and millet was worth 917 million yuan, totaling more than 1.7 billion yuan! In the counties affected by the disaster last autumn, there was even no harvest, with wailing and misery everywhere, and starving people on the road. Today, recalling these thrilling figures, can we not, in addition to being sincerely terrified, realize that the past cannot be remedied and that the future can be pursued?</p>
<p>The water conservancy and rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are crisscrossed, and they have always been known for their superiority over other provinces. Moreover, each county also levies water conservancy expenses under the land tax. There should be no worries about funds for water conservancy construction. However, when the drought comes, they can only sit back and watch without any measures and cannot be exempt from disasters. We fully expect that the silk industry will improve this spring, and we will make up for the losses in mulberry trees. How can we know that the decline in cocoon prices is even more severe than in the past, and the heavy burden of donations and taxes has increased rather than decreased. The suffering and displacement are unspeakable. At this time, it is the rainy season, and farmers are just starting to cultivate the land and eagerly waiting for rain. However, Henan, Shandong, Hebei and other provinces have already reported drought. The soil in Lingbao and other places is dry and cracked, and it is said that flower seeds cannot be sown. Recently, early signs have also been seen in southern Anhui, with seedlings withering, and the Xu and Hai prefectures have not had penetrating rain for two months. Even the fields are dry and cracked, and farmers in the four townships are praying for rain. In Beijing, Changzhou and other places, the farmland is also dry, and a drought is about to occur. The scene of farmland in Zhejiang is that the seedlings are several inches long, but there is no water to transplant. For days, the south wind has been blowing, the sky is clear and the weather is bright, and there is no sign of the rainy season at all. I don't know when the rain will come. If we don't take urgent preventive measures, there will still be a drought this year, and the people will have no food to eat. At the time of the severe drought last year, we also thought about water conservancy and raised a large amount of debt, hoping to use it for disaster relief and work-for-relief in the disaster areas. But what is the fact? Perhaps the disaster area is so large that our people cannot know it. We believe that today's disaster prevention should focus on three points: Salvaging what can be saved, first, widespread placement of water lifting equipment, second, dredging of rivers, and third, planting drought-resistant crops. Let's discuss them separately:</p>
<p>The original water lifting equipment in rural areas, whether relying on wind power or livestock power, has very little water lifting capacity. During the severe drought last year, the weather was scorching above, and the river water became shallower day by day below. The length of the water wheel was limited, and irrigation was not easy. The water demand of the fields doubled, and the supply was even more difficult. Although the farmers worked day and night, and used manpower to supplement the shortcomings of livestock and wind power, the crops still could not avoid withering. This is like a cup of water on a cartload of firewood, which cannot be helped by the original water lifting equipment. However, rural families have experienced several ups and downs in recent years and are living below the poverty line. It is impossible for them to afford to purchase practical water pumps. Although the various sectors helped to purchase them last year to relieve the urgent need, there were too few porridge and too many monks, and they failed to achieve universal results. However, the advantages of water pumps for serious matters are incomparable to the original water lifting equipment, which is known to everyone. The way to prevent drought is to widely install water pumps as the initial step in preventing drought. It would be even better if electricity could be used for irrigation. The government should order the provinces and instruct the cities and counties to make overall plans and provide financial assistance from the government.</p>
<p>I still remember that when the drought was raging last summer, the river water was completely dry in the higher terrain, and even drinking water was a panic. The residents upstream of the river competed to block it, so that those downstream could not get a drop of water. Therefore, the dredging of the river. Not only should the above-mentioned canal projects be completed as soon as possible, but other tributaries and small streams should also be considered, otherwise, even if there are water pumps, it will be in vain.</p>
<p>Due to the different psychological states of farmers in various places, the crops are not uniform, one province is like this, one county is like this, and even one town and one village are like this. Chinese farmers rely on the sky for food, and all the waxing and waning are tied to the sky, and they follow the evolution of nature and cannot use manpower to adapt to changes; and under the consistent thinking of farmers, there are few opportunities to improve farming. Therefore, as last year when Jiaxing farmland was shrouded in drought, there were completely different results: the Wangdian area of Jiana is all rice fields, which need a lot of water. After the drought and famine, there was no way to supply water, resulting in withered rice and cracked soil, and no harvest. However, the ginger fields in the Xinfeng area of Jiabei had surprisingly good harvests, because ginger fields need very little water and are afraid of hot summer days. Sudden thunderstorms can cause the ginger stems to develop fever. During the severe drought last summer, there was no thunder or rain. This weather is most suitable for the growth of ginger, so last year's ginger fields had a good harvest due to the good process, which is the opposite of the rice fields in the Wangdian area. There are also rice fields in the Haiyan County, and 19 out of 10 were withered and died. Only the cotton fields in Huangwan did not lose their original vitality due to the drought, which is the opposite of the rice fields. In normal years, there is no worry about water shortage, only fear of too much water, so it is not affected by the severe drought at all. Originally, if the two counties of Haiyan and Haiyan were relatively high in western Zhejiang, it was more difficult than any other county to divert water for irrigation in the years of waterlogging and drought, so it is necessary to study whether the farmland in the two counties is suitable for permanent rice cultivation. In China, where natural disasters occur every year, there is no active way to prevent disasters from happening for a while, so we have to plant more drought-resistant crops, hoping to reduce the degree of disasters.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's Grain Control Process</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Turning to the economic history of the Soviet Union in 1935, one of the most important pages is the abolition of grain rationing. In the past year, there have been significant changes to the wage standards in various industries in the Soviet Union. On March 17 of that year, the government explicitly ordered the correction of labor laws and the abolition of restrictions on the minimum wage system throughout the Soviet Union; in recent years, the Soviet industrial sector had established a low-wage system, and many factories had guarantees regarding the so-called low wage. However, this new decree only abolished the restrictions on the low wages earned by general workers. Only if various industries fall into a state of stagnation through no fault of the workers, the workers should receive one-third of their usual wages. Since June 1 of last year, the wage system has been changed again in the opposite direction, in order to reconcile the impact of the rising bread prices in the ration, it was explicitly ordered to increase wages in various industries by 10 to 15 percent. According to the news released by the government, the most beneficial thing after the promulgation of this new decree is that 4.2 million workers with the lowest wages, their current average monthly wage is 92 rubles, (this type of worker includes 140,000 low-level miners) and the monthly expenditure is only 79 rubles. A few weeks later, a supplementary law was promulgated, giving employees whose "work has considerable military relationship" an additional 10 percent increase in wages. However, the benefits given to workers by this change in the wage system have unfortunately become castles in the air, as the government simultaneously reduced the value of rubles for workers to purchase goods. Not only did they raise the price of bread, but they also changed the supply system. Since the Soviet Union re-adopted the grain rationing coupon system five years ago, the value of the ruble has had no fixed standard, it depends on the source of all owners and supplies at any time. Those with privileges can represent a value of three pounds and five ounces of bread or six ounces of cream with one ruble. However, those who are treated more poorly can only exchange their ruble for 11 and three-quarters ounces of bread, or the same one ounce of cream. Factory workers can get the cheapest food, of which bread can be exchanged daily at the lowest price, bread coupons can be distributed regularly, meat, cream, wheat flour, and other less produced items are rarely distributed, and they can also be distributed from the beginning of last year, but there is no fixed time and the limit is insufficient.</p>
<p>The so-called grain rationing was created in the Soviet Union in 1917. However, it was abolished by the Soviet Union government ten years ago. During the implementation of the New Economic Policy (1921-1928), private enterprises and profitable matters were allowed, food and other commodities could be sold publicly in stores and markets with very few restrictions, even rare goods and goods pricing were not restricted. In 1929, the Soviet Union re-adopted a chaotic system of item rationing, including food, clothing, and other various items, as part of the five-year economic plan. As for various stores, which are commonly seen in other countries, were completely abolished in the Soviet Union for about three years. If the people of the Soviet Union did not get the permission of the authorities, even the acquisition of a pair of shoes or a piece of soap was considered illegal. This distribution system has now been completely abolished. Recently, at the Communist Party Congress, Domestic Supply People's Commissar Mikoyan reported on the failure of this system, therefore, the Communist Party had long decided in its ideals to restore the open sale of goods in stores, adopt a new system of "state-run stores," and sell goods directly to customers. In fact, the item rationing system has long been abolished, and other commodities, except for food, can currently be purchased in various stores, and the quantity is not restricted. However, the prices of all commodities in these stores are regulated by the government, which is unfortunate for the general customers. The prices set are too high for the Soviet low-level workers. In this type of open store, butter is roughly eight rubles per pound, meat is two and two-tenths rubles per pound, sugar is four and a half rubles per pound, tea is eight rubles per pound, and eggs are half a ruble per basket. Therefore, the commodities that workers can exchange for their monthly wage of 92 rubles are limited. Even calculating the prices in gold pounds is of no help. The exchange rates stipulated by the Moscow government are only intended for foreign tourists who need to exchange at the price, and there is no other intention. As for special stores that supply the needs of customers who carry foreign currency, the exchange rates set by the government are not valued by the Soviet authorities either.</p>
<p>In the past few years, factory workers could buy regularly distributed bread and other irregularly distributed foods at the lowest price every day, so although their wages were low, they could still maintain their lives. However, since the change in the status of workers in June of the previous year, their lives have become more difficult, and the increase in wages is enough to make them lose their eligibility to receive the lowest-priced food. Workers still need two and one-fifth pounds of bread and some other food every day. However, the 92 rubles they earn today are worth less than the 83 rubles they earned last year. They can buy all kinds of goods in the open market, but the prices are much more expensive than in state-run stores. In addition, there are foreign national food supply stores that are exclusively for foreign nationals to buy goods, and there are many goods, but they only supply foreign currency or precious metals, and do not supply Soviet workers to buy goods. How low the price of agricultural products obtained by farmers is and how high the price paid by urban residents is, the government has never explained. The method of obtaining agricultural products and transporting them to cities is entirely in the hands of the state, and urban residents only trade directly in the spring and winter seasons of the year. After farmers have completed their grain delivery obligations to the government, a few months are stipulated as a period of permission, and barter is completely prohibited. Those who act as intermediaries in a private capacity have been openly reduced. Because intermediaries can obtain a lot of profit by introducing farmers' products for factory consumption, and their position has now been completely replaced by the government. The interest rate charged by this new intermediary is something that outsiders cannot know, except that merchants from various countries can dream of it. We can prove that the supply of food in the Soviet Union is completely monopolized by the government.</p>
<p>In general, farmers must pay the prescribed grains for every hundred acres of land suitable for cultivation as a compulsory tax. The remaining grains are encouraged by government agencies and state-owned cooperative agencies to sell them at agreed prices according to special decrees. The grains obtained by the above two methods are used to supply the army, factories, shops, and for export. The grains obtained by farmers for paying compulsory taxes are valued at 72 rubles per ton for buckwheat and 88 rubles for wheat. The same grains are valued at 90 rubles per ton for buckwheat and 100 rubles for wheat when farmers sell them to the state voluntarily. The government wholesales this buckwheat to various factories at a price of 525 rubles per ton and 600 rubles for wheat. These grains are then ground into flour by the factories to make low-priced bread. Therefore, the government makes a profit of six times more on the grains sold to factories under the grain rationing system. The bread sold by state-run stores, made from buckwheat, costs one and three-quarters rubles per pound, and the bread made from wheat costs two rubles per pound, making even more profit. Therefore, customers have to pay 30 to 40 times more for bread sold openly in state-run stores than for the bread directly distributed to farmers by the government. The government has a monopoly on the supply of bread needed by urban residents, which is obvious. The amount of grain collected is not very appropriate for supplying the needs of the army and cities. As for whether farmers agree with this system, there is no clear indication, and the authorities are not interested in considering this issue. The government has declared that the grain rationing system will be abolished and is preparing to supply all the needs of the people with new stores. If the government intends to equalize the prices of food in stores with the wages of industries, it will be easy. The government is currently sacrificing a large part of the tax rate levied on urban residents, but the benefits obtained are still inappropriate. Those who operate similar stores in various countries must know the reason. The so-called sacrifice, such as raising wages or lowering prices, or both, is the main issue before the government abolishes the central item rationing system and re-establishes open stores, because if the people are completely separated from the item rationing system and wages and prices are not corrected in advance, it is tantamount to pushing low-wage laborers into starvation.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Securities: The Situation Creates Fluctuations in the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Last week, the domestic bond market situation in the Chinese Securities Exchange fluctuated completely with the tension of the situation. However, there are only a few days left in this month's trading, and there may be a tortuous ups and downs due to delivery relations. The 96 public bond has fluctuated extremely violently. Initially, due to the favorable news, the peak once reached ten and a half yuan. Then, due to the selling of the fourth and northern gangs, it plummeted again. Finally, with the excitement of trade, it turned upward again. As a result, it rose by more than one yuan compared to the previous weekend. According to the investigation of the square account of the 96, the accumulated ticket is still as high as 20 million yuan. Both long and short sides have their own strengths. The long side is the largest with 5 million on the fourth, and the rest are the 14th, 77th, and 78th. Both sides are evenly matched, and there will be a competition in the future. The weekly market situation is further divided and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Monday) The situation in Hebei turned peaceful, people's hearts turned stable, short covering and new buying rose suddenly, soaring one to two yuan or so. The salt tax soared four yuan and stopped trading, echoing the previous plunge and stop trading. (Tuesday) The Hebei incident took a sharp turn for the worse, short covering continued to increase, and the market price continued to rise by six to seven cents. (Wednesday) The initial trend was quite good, but rumors arose later, resulting in a fall of seven to eight cents. (Thursday) Due to the Chahar incident, the situation became tense again, people's hearts were like frightened birds, the northern gang sold in large quantities, and the market price plummeted by six to seven cents to more than three yuan. (Friday) The situation in the north was suddenly tight and suddenly relaxed, people's hearts were shaken and uncertain. As a result, the market price of the previous row rose by several cents to one and a half yuan, while the latter row fell by about one yuan. (Weekend) It started to rise and then fell, and then returned to rise. As a result, it still rose by more than one yuan. In total, the market price for the week rose by six to seven cents to more than three yuan compared to the previous weekend. The compilation slightly fell by three cents, and the total turnover was 235.482 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance: Interbank Interest Rates Show No Movement, Yesterday's Market Still Maintained the Original State of Two Cents, Subsidiary Coins Were Slightly Weak, and Copper Coins Were Slightly Longer</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the silver market has been unusually strong because the position is still not able to be generous. The interbank interest rates in the market are still open at two cents in the morning and afternoon markets. In the interbank bill trading, there were more than 130 account transfers in the morning market, and more than 100,000 in new transactions. There were no transactions in the afternoon market. There were more than 500,000 transactions in the Small General Association. More than 200,000 of loan transactions were redeemed, and no new loans were made. There were no banknote transactions recovered, and only more than 300,000 of secretly marked banknotes were issued. The amount of remittances from various routes was more than 200,000, and the source of guest routes was 150,000. There were no reports of going to the stomach. The amount of foreign public bills received and resolved by money houses was more than 27 million. As for the receipt and resolution, because it was a Sunday bank holiday, it was completely suspended.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market situation of subsidiary coins, although there were occasional ups and downs, the overall trend was still stable. Because there was a return of corner coins, although transactions were booming, the market was trending downstream. The Jiangnan subsidiary coin opened at 828 yuan and 5 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets, a slight drop of one yuan compared to the previous market. The trading volume was 4,000 jiao in the morning market and none in the afternoon market. The Guangdong subsidiary coin fell by 1 yuan and 2 jiao in the morning market, to 733 yuan and 6 jiao.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: US Cotton Spot Prices Return to 12 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of US cotton was relatively active. The price rose by 3 to 8 points due to purchases by brokers and foreign merchants, heavy rains in Texas, and reports of the South Texas River overflowing its banks, which may damage cotton crops. The volume of transactions was not high. Currently, the market situation is relatively stable due to the statement of 13 cents on the previous day. It then retreated slightly due to profit-taking by bulls, and finally closed firm due to short covering. The spot price rose by 5 points, and the futures price rose by 7 to 9 points. British cotton was closed. Indian cotton rose due to short covering and purchases by speculators. The price of Pingguoer rose by 2.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 2.5 to 2.75 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 2.25 to 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (15th telegram).</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Zi Luoxi Cotton for the 17th of April and May is 215 rupees, the same as the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<p>A report from New York on the 14th reported on the cotton market during the week, saying that the market was declining, with multiple profit-taking and a lack of new stimuli. The current demand for textiles is not good, so buyers are limited to price declines only. Transactions are very few, pending the revision of the Agricultural Adjustment Act by the parliament and the indication of pawning. A certain informal industry and economic committee urged a one-cent pledge to open the world market for US cotton. Some colleagues agree that the reward of benefits seems to be a way to encourage foreign production. Mr. Wallace is unwilling to criticize the pledge. It is expected that the handling fee for the next quarter will not change. The poor weather in May and June has caused the new cotton to resist, and the need for sunny weather has also increased. However, the sale of fertilizer in mid-May indicates an increase in planting power. US Cotton Weekend Statistics (Units: Thousand Bales)</p>

<h3>Grain: Rainy Weather Allows the Rice Market to See a Settlement</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from various gangs still only arrived on the 17th, (a total of more than 3,000 shi), and the sales market was slightly relaxed due to the cloudy and sunny weather, and the people's hearts were floating. Therefore, the overall situation seems to be trending towards a fixed image. As a result, the prices of Su Tong japonica and various late rice crops did not rise or fall, only Nanhang early rice actually rose by more than a corner due to the scarcity of goods. Yinbian Yuan also had no honor or disgrace, and Du Jian had a mediocre character.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few sources from various roads in Hexia. The market's goods went to the stomach. Because the weather turned cloudy, the whiteness of japonica was weak, and the price was high. The middle and secondary ranks turned tired by several cents to a corner. The arrival of thin rice was less marketable, and the market price was quite beautiful. The early rice had a slow turnover, and the price was high. The middle and secondary ranks were reduced by about one cent. The price of Bai Yuan and other goods did not rise or fall much.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Hainan Red Opening Price Drops One Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and tired. The guild divided the market. 24 coarse sand white spot goods called 16 yuan, and transit goods called 5 yuan and 1 jiao. None of the transactions were completed. Taikoo Sugar B Mike called 17 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, and the recipient still received 2 jiao and a half. It was not completed. The fine white sugar of this factory was slightly tired. Zhenyu and Zhenji No. 1 both opened at 15 yuan and 4 jiao, No. 1 car ice at 20 yuan and a half, and Shuangfu ice at 22 yuan and 4 jiao. Only the Chao Gang opened 50 packs of Hainan red at 10 yuan and 3 jiao for No. 1 goods, and dozens of packs of secondary red at 10 yuan.</p>

<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt, Although It Has Fallen, Still Has No Sales</h3>
<p>Asphalt is in the era of falling orders. Candle washing has stopped. Most soap making has switched to using coconut oil, butter, etc., so that the asphalt sales market is almost unattended. Although the inventory of local businesses is thin, the market is so quiet that they have completely given up on imports. As a result, the price of Hankou has also fallen. Heavy Jing oil has fallen to 12 taels, but sales are still quiet. Because the goods in the Shanghai market vary in quality, the selling prices also vary. Heavy Jing oil ranges from 20 yuan to 22 yuan per block. It is feared that it cannot be determined what standard is used as the basis.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Blue Lead Supply Exceeds Demand</h3>
<p>After the tea house gang stopped handling blue lead, only paint companies, yellow lead factories, etc. had a small amount of transactions. The price is abnormally weak. The current estimate is 13 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, a small decrease of 2 jiao and a half compared to before. It is said that only 60 to 70 pieces were opened.</p>
<p>As for Hunan native lead, a lot has been shipped in recently, and the inventory is quite thick, so there is little progress in the opening price. The current price is 13 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 jiao, which is already a soft drop of 2 to 3 jiao compared to before.</p>

<h3>Affirmation and Negation in Literature</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>A realist writer, due to contradictions in their worldview, can create the greatest tragedy through the interplay and conflict of affirmation and negation in their works.</p>
<p>The affirmation and negation referred to here are the same as those in philosophy.</p>
<p>Needless to say, a writer who is faithful to reality will depict it without mercy. Such a writer's work will inevitably present both the negative and affirmative aspects of reality. For example, in the works of Balzac and Gogol, the nobility and feudal landlords are presented as the negative, and the middle class as the affirmative.</p>
<p>A writer ahead of their time affirms this affirmative aspect, inevitably leading society forward onto a path of development, essentially acting as a guide for this new society.</p>
<p>Although Gogol's works aptly depict both the affirmative and negative aspects, Gogol himself said that his works were "laughter through tears." Indeed, the laughter in his works is tinged with tears. Why? Because he was saddened by the incompetence of certain people. If, in his works, affirmation could defeat negation (i.e., understand the inevitable decline of certain people and strive for affirmation), then there would be no tragedy! However, he reinforced affirmation by more stubbornly emphasizing negation, pitting them against each other, thus creating tragedy! Because the reality emphatically declared the development of affirmation! Laughter emerged from tears. For the above reasons, Gogol was merely an outstanding writer of truth, merely a critical realist. His hope for the revival of negation prevented him from becoming a writer ahead of his time, because, as mentioned above, he did not guide the new society.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most appropriate method for addressing negation and affirmation in works is to portray negation as a process of affirmative development, depicting the gradual demise of the negative aspect, thereby further highlighting the vibrant growth of the affirmative.</p>
<p>Some critics believe that in such a chaotic modern society—especially in the society we live in—emphasis should be placed on the depiction of negation, because the incompetence, dead ends, and evils of the negative aspect need writers to truthfully express. Moreover, because contemporary writers mostly come from the intellectual class, they are distant from active existence in society, making it difficult to understand that active existence. Therefore, the description of passive existence becomes necessary, and this task is within the reach of modern writers. Describing passive existence means emphasizing the depiction of negation.</p>
<p>We find this argument somewhat mechanical, because it severs negation and affirmation, limiting itself to the depiction of negation. Its achievement is only exposure or critical realism, which is not what we need.</p>
<p>At this point, perhaps readers will raise a counter-question, "Then should we focus solely on affirmation!" In fact, focusing solely on affirmation is also a mistake. Although we know what the future society will be like, it is by no means an abstract thing. It is what historical practice tells us. We can imagine, but we cannot deviate from practice. If we only describe affirmation and abandon negation, then such affirmation becomes a world conjured up by a magician, not something transformed from the negative aspect.</p>
<p>Recently, I finished reading a very good work, Sholokhov's "Virgin Soil Upturned." This work not only depicts the process of collective farm development, but also provides us with excellent lessons on the handling of affirmation and negation.</p>
<p>Sholokhov takes Davidov, the leader of the collective farm movement, as the affirmative element, artistically and accurately placing him on the front line. At the same time, the White Army Captain Polovtsev and the wealthy Yakov Lukich, as the negative elements, without a hint of objectivism, work in opposition to Davidov in a truthful manner, realistically depicting the demise of the negative and the advancement of the affirmative. It is precisely through this fundamental conflict of forces that diverse and positive characters emerge, creating new scenes. Through individual postures, social pathos is born, enabling readers to better understand the difficulties and growth of a developing society.</p>
<p>Therefore, in depicting truth, we need to address affirmation and negation mutually, without emphasizing one side. Relying on a progressive worldview, we should portray the demise of the negative as an expression of the growth of the affirmative.</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Mo Fu</p>
<p>…Suddenly, a decision arose in his heart; and all the knots were completely untied. His chest felt as empty as a vast wilderness. His wife's withered face, the miserable cries of his four children… suddenly fled from his memory, no longer troubling him.</p>
<p>He walked along the bustling street, as if walking in a desert, completely unaware of the vehicles, horses, and pedestrians surrounding him, all rushing about for survival. What flashed before his eyes could not attract his attention, nor could his ears hear the noisy din. He followed behind the person walking in front of him, like flowing water, as if there was an unknowable, invisible line connecting them.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, he stepped into a true wilderness. He didn't know when it started, but he was all alone, swaying his body westward! The sun, hiding behind the deep blue, black mountains, emitted spoke-like rays of light, forming semi-circular gear teeth. Surrounding him were scarlet, red, and purple clouds, moving about. From behind him, a layer of thin darkness surged in the distance; this was the opposite of dawn, growing thicker and thicker, constantly changing.</p>
<p>The sun withdrew its last brilliance from this sinful world, and everything in the human world seemed to disappear with it.</p>
<p>He moved his legs indifferently, controlled by some external force, his hands clasped in front of his chest, his eyes empty, facing the boundless grayness.</p>
<p>He crossed the fields, walked to the riverbank, and stopped. There was no wind. The pale yellow moon rose above his head, reflected on the smooth, mirror-like surface of the water. He stared at the moon's reflection in the river, motionless, like a sorcerer praying for the departed. Continuing for about three minutes, he suddenly plunged into the river as if seized by thought—this sudden action surprised him greatly, but in that instant, he felt truly liberated—delivering a tragic blow to the drowsy and sensitive dusk, the trembling sound floating straight into the sky. The smooth water surface, at this time, seemed like molten glass boiling in a furnace, many white mounds rising high on the river surface, tumbling and dancing. The pale yellow moon's reflection, agitated by the water, rippled and disappeared.</p>
<p>The night deepened, and silence returned.</p>
<h3>Porter</h3>
<p>— Wan Shisi</p>
<p>Outside the borders of people's dreams,</p>
<p>We gather at the pier,</p>
<p>Like the dead faces of comrades!</p>
<p>The gray sky: high, and vast!</p>
<p>In the barge: the siren wails.</p>
<p>Heavy sacks tightly clasp our spines.</p>
<p>We, hastily, carry them from the warehouse to the ship,</p>
<p>And from the barge…rush to the shore!</p>
<p>Ceaselessly panting, ceaselessly</p>
<p>Pulling soiled sleeves, wiping away sweat!</p>
<p>We are so uncomplainingly bowed down,</p>
<p>Grunting—grunting, bearing the weight on the ground!</p>
<p>Many legs, stepping in unison,</p>
<p>We are steadfast and strong…</p>
<p>Every day we awaken the metropolis,</p>
<p>From our eyes: the morning sun rises!</p>
<h3>Insect Trap Lamp</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>During the busy farming season, our school regularly had a "busy leave," allowing adults to cut wheat and plant rice, allowing women to cook meals, deliver food, and bail water, and allowing young children to tend cattle, carry babies, and watch the threshing ground. In the evening, if the weather was too hot and it happened to be a bright moonlit and starry night, people who had worked hard were willing to take advantage of the cool breeze, and we would invite them to gather at the Guandi Temple! In the square in front of our school gate, everyone brought their teapots and pipes, and casually chatted.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this chat session, we made a special effort to hang up a gas lamp from the New Year's temple fair. Its dazzling light immediately dimmed the bright moon, and we also hoped that everyone could take this opportunity to review their thousand-character primers, recite the "Elementary Reader," or tell stories while being able to see each other's smiling faces. But things turned out unexpectedly. Insects from all directions followed the neighbors from all directions and came to the gathering. We saw locusts flying all over the yard, mole crickets crawling everywhere, and older children fought and tore at each other in competition, causing a chorus of crying. Millions upon millions of leafhoppers and moths covered the lamp, and scarab beetles rose and fell like flying stones, hitting people's heads. Mosquitoes and gnats were like dust in a hurricane, everywhere. In this way, order was greatly disrupted. Not only did we not feel the refreshing night breeze, but everyone was covered in sweat.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation was like opening an old account book. I suddenly remembered that when I was a pest control worker, I had caused a great disaster because of an oil lamp. This incident made me feel guilty every time I thought about it. Originally, we were allowed to speak freely at the chat session, so I tried to extinguish the fire in the lamp. With everyone's eyes suddenly in darkness, I clapped my hands heavily to stop the noisy shouts.</p>
<p>"Today, I have a story to tell you all, please pay attention.</p>
<p>A year or two ago, I was doing pest control work in a place. All the insects that came here today were the ones I had to catch. I caught them and killed them to prevent them from harming the crops. At that time, our method was not only for us to catch them, but also to ask everyone who farmed to catch them together. We knocked on every household, explained the reasons, and asked them to help.</p>
<p>"We wanted every household to install an electric light in their own field, with a large basin of water under the light, of course, the water couldn't soak the light. We also wanted them to sprinkle a little kerosene in the basin. As you have read in books, insects are afraid of the smell of kerosene, and kerosene on insects kills them. Sprinkling kerosene in the cesspool eliminates maggots..."</p>
<p>After the lamp was extinguished, the crowd was silent for a moment, but soon there was noise again. Children cried, laughed, and shouted sharply. Adults whispered, and the sound of pipes knocking on the ground rang out… Women dropped things, borrowed matches, and struck matches, the firelight stirring the vision of those in front and behind. It was difficult for them to grasp my words completely. Even when our cooperative distributed loans and we spoke, it was like the bursting of bubbles in an oil pan.</p>
<p>"I asked them to prepare. We provided the equipment, and they provided the oil. Can you guess if they followed the method we told them?…"</p>
<p>I had to speak with even greater force and make the words ripple to get the audience's minds moving a little. However, the effect was still not great.</p>
<p>"They are not as smart as you all. They didn't believe our words at all. On the night they lit the lamps, I rode my bicycle to check, and only four or five places had the lights on. The rest all lit the lamps in their own houses, the men slept, and the women mended clothes. You may not realize it, but these few families who lit the lamps suffered greatly…"</p>
<p>I waved my hand and said in a louder voice:</p>
<p>"Just like today, insects from all directions came to these fields. There were too many insects, and the insect trap lamps were useless. These fields, these good people, are still scolding us for causing them to have no harvest. Many people who didn't light insect trap lamps were also saying, 'Look, look, I knew it would be harmful.' Everyone, did we harm them, or did the farmers' lack of cooperation harm them?——For this reason, the school, not because it's afraid of spending money, but because it's afraid that this place will suffer this kind of harm again, in the future; this lamp will no longer be lit.……"</p>
<p>After that, we each bring incense sticks to our summer evening chats, never lighting a lamp again.</p>
<h3>Little Girl's Sweetheart</h3>
<h3>Artificial Madman (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— He Luo</p>
<p>One,</p>
<p>The father was a kiln owner with twenty or thirty kiln workers who, from the ninth watch to midnight, drilled underground, excavating the treasures of the earth for him. His property accumulated like piles of coal.</p>
<p>The mother was also a venomous shrew, specializing in hitting her daughters-in-law on the head and stomach, capable of causing them to miscarry. Their backs and legs were also covered in scars.</p>
<p>The madman was their fourth son.</p>
<p>By the time he was twenty, he had grown into a very sturdy young man. His arms were very strong, and like his parents, he grabbed the kiln workers by the hair, refusing to let go. But letting go was even worse. Bricks, stones, or wooden sticks—anything he could get his hands on, he would use to strike. If he picked up a kitchen knife, he would threaten to cut off people's ears.</p>
<p>Although his parents were a little worried that he would cause trouble, the ones he beat were ultimately kiln workers. According to their reasoning, kiln workers depended on kiln owners for a living. Without kiln owners, kiln workers wouldn't know how to live, except by begging.</p>
<p>Sometimes they would boast triumphantly, saying that kiln workers were born bad seeds, and if you didn't give them something spicy, they wouldn't know your kindness.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, something happened. The kiln workers, who conquered nature and created wealth by drilling underground, only cared about extracting coal. After they emptied the earth, it suddenly collapsed, crushing seventeen people to death. Seventeen people were crushed into a meat paste, indistinguishable from each other.</p>
<p>After that, the kiln owner's business deteriorated day by day. The newly hired kiln workers were lured away by other kiln owners after only a few days. In the end, only three or five people remained, supporting the declining facade.</p>
<p>The kiln owner's family also changed from covert infighting to open warfare. The methods previously used to deal with kiln workers were now used at home. Father and sons argued from morning to night, and from night to morning, and as they argued, they began to fight, resulting in bloodshed.</p>
<p>The most reckless of them was their fourth son.</p>
<p>He had learned all the techniques of cursing and hitting people since he was a child. Now he could knock down his mother with a headbutt. If his father picked up a stick, he would pull and push, tripping his father to the ground. Before his father could get up, he would loudly curse and shout, running out into the street.</p>
<p>It could be said that the brothers were like vicious dogs, very good at gnawing at heels. They constantly glared, raised their eyebrows, puffed out their chests, cursing as soon as they opened their mouths, and hitting as soon as they reached out. Seven or eight hands, like tendrils, wrapped around someone, and everyone rolled to the ground together, rolling and tumbling, making it impossible to see who was hitting whom.</p>
<h3>University Days (4)</h3>
<p>— Written by German Storm, translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>Renali was not among them: she stood alone not far from the door, gazing at the girls with a slightly melancholy air; they were talking lively, not showing any restraint in other people's gorgeous house: they simply didn't pay attention to her.</p>
<p>There is nothing more selfish and cruel than young people. But after I came in, the mayor's wife also came in. She greeted these young people, and after scanning the hall with her "general's gaze," as Fritz said, she walked up to Nali and took her hand. "In order to make dancing pairs able to match each other," she said to the dance teacher, "please line up the boys according to their height!"—The dance teacher did as she said, and at the same time, she also went to the girls, wanting to arrange them in the same way. The daughter with the golden hair of a sudden morning, was the tallest, almost a head taller than the others. She was placed on the wall opposite us: but then the difficulty came out. "I don't know, Charlotte," said the mayor's wife. "Who is above and who is below you and Nali, because in my opinion you are the same height!"</p>
<p>This Charlotte was the daughter of a court attendant and judge, and she stepped back. "Miss Nali is probably taller than me," she said softly.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, my lady," my friend's mother called to her, "come out of that corner of yours, and compare with Miss Nali!"</p>
<p>The little girl had to come out, back to back, to compete with the tailor's daughter. But—my eyes saw very clearly that she had the ability to make the craftsman's daughter's black head hardly touch her head.</p>
<p>This little girl was wearing a light-colored dress. Renali was wearing a black woolen dress with red stripes, with a white crepe shawl around her neck. The color of this dress was too dark, giving a strange feeling, but it was a perfect match for her.</p>
<p>The mayor's wife compared the two girls for a while. "Charlotte," she said, "you used to be the first beauty; but you have to be careful not to let her surpass you! I think she is going to surpass you."</p>
<p>Hearing this, I seemed to see the little girl's black eyes sparkle.</p>

<h3>Report on School Health Inspection in Qinghai</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wenshan and Shao Xiaxian, Qinghai Provincial Health Laboratory</p>
<p>The Health Education Committee has been established since the end of last year, and it has been five months since then. Initially, due to the severe cold and long winter vacation, as well as the fact that medical personnel were all part-time, it was delayed until April 13th that the committee began to carry out its main task, "School Health." Although this started late, it was also due to environmental factors, which were unavoidable.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of medical personnel, the committee can only go to various schools in the afternoon to implement health education and treatment. Currently, ten schools have started. Once there are sufficient medical personnel, all primary and secondary schools in the provincial capital will be started, so as to enable young men and women to obtain good health education and habits, as well as the happiness of a healthy body, so as to become the elites who will promote health undertakings in the future. Now, the statistics of shortcomings after the health examination are classified as follows:</p>
<p>Total number of people examined: 482 (including 188 from the First Middle School of the Muslim Progress Association, 140 from the Second Primary School, all male; 154 from the Affiliated Primary School of the First Women's Normal School, including one male, the rest female)</p>
<p>Number of people with shortcomings: 406</p>
<p>Total number of shortcomings: 1002</p>
<p>Types of shortcomings:</p>
<p>Poor eyesight: Mild 55, Severe 12, Most Severe 3, Total 70</p>
<p>Ear diseases: 44</p>
<p>Trachoma: Mild 86, Severe 63, Most Severe 28, Total 177</p>
<p>Other eye diseases: 36</p>
<p>Dental diseases: Mild 89, Severe 45, Most Severe 2, Total 136</p>
<p>Tonsillar hypertrophy: Mild 121, Severe 75, Most Severe 17, Total 213</p>
<p>Lymph node enlargement: Mild 75, Severe 8, Most Severe 1, Total 84</p>
<p>Malnutrition: Mild 92, Severe 20, Most Severe 2, Total 114</p>
<p>Skin diseases: Mild 107, Severe 29, Most Severe 13, Total 149</p>
<p>Weak heart: 4</p>
<p>Weak lungs: 14</p>
<p>Orthopedic surgery: 7</p>
<p>Rhinitis: 95</p>
<p>Goiter: Mild 38, Severe 5, Most Severe 1, Total 44</p>
<p>Inguinal hernia: 1</p>
<p>Phimosis: 12</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that young male and female students are not all healthy. Although they attend classes every day, the soundness of the individual cannot be discovered without a physical examination. The examination method used by the committee adopts the health examination format promulgated by the Central Health Administration as the standard, including weight, height, vision, hearing, nutrition, as well as ears, eyes, mouth, nose, heart, lungs, spleen, lymph nodes, thyroid gland, reproductive organs, etc. All are included in the examination. The results obtained are indicated by symbols such as "mild," "severe," and "most severe" to indicate the severity of the shortcomings and whether urgent treatment or correction is needed. These are the key points after the health examination. However, due to the lack of hospitals, systemic examinations such as urine and blood cannot be obtained, and important shortcomings cannot be corrected. This is also a regrettable matter for the committee. For example, tonsillar hypertrophy and the resection of phimosis cannot be treated without surgery and hospitalization. It is hoped that people in society will enthusiastically create hospitals for the promotion of health undertakings, so as to benefit the general young men and women and build a future for society and the country.</p>
<h3>Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation and Medical Lawsuits</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The National Lawyers Association has recently been working hard to promote the movement for compensation for wrongful imprisonment, and has designated June 5th as a publicity day. This movement to protect human rights is truly an unprecedented initiative in China's thousands of years of history, and its significance is extremely important. In a country ruled by law, the government has a legal responsibility to protect the people. Unfortunately, if a wrongful imprisonment occurs, the people suffer losses in reputation, body, spirit, and property, and the government bears the responsibility for failing to protect the people's legal rights. A civilized country cannot eliminate all lawsuits, but it also cannot allow wrongful imprisonments to exist. Compensation is merely a remedy after the fact! On the one hand, it allows the victims to partially compensate for their losses in reputation and money, even if only a tiny amount. On the other hand, it makes those who make false accusations more cautious and makes judicial officers act with care. The intention is very good, and the law is very beautiful. However, this good law, which prevails throughout Europe, has not yet been realized in our country under the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. This is truly regrettable. Now, because of their profession, the lawyers have personally witnessed the many wrongful imprisonments. They are speaking out and working hard to remedy the situation. We believe in the good intentions of these benevolent people, and we should unite to support them and promote the early realization of this movement.</p>
<p>The number of lawsuits is increasing day by day, and it is not known how many of them involve wrongful accusations. How can this be seen? It can be seen in lawsuits between doctors and patients. As a member of the medical community, I have heard and seen many cases of patients suing doctors! But the result—the doctor wins in most cases—from this, it can be seen that most of the patients' accusations against doctors are false accusations. In the world, there is only one truth. If this is right, then that is wrong; if this is wrong, then that is right. Therefore, there can be no situation where the plaintiff and defendant are both right or both wrong. If the defendant loses the case, then the plaintiff's accusation is legitimate. If the defendant wins the case, then the plaintiff's false accusation is undeniable. If false accusations do not carry the responsibility of compensation, then not only are human rights not protected, but the nation's most solemn law is also treated like a cheap trifle. If the cause of the loss is due to a judge's misjudgment, then the responsibility for the wrongful imprisonment should be borne by the judicial officer, which is a matter of utmost fairness. Furthermore, I have heard that reputation is a person's second life, and for the medical profession, a good reputation is especially the standard. Once a patient makes an accusation, the newspapers report it, and society condemns it, and the reputation is already widespread. Regardless of the outcome of the case, the reputation, which is difficult to obtain but easy to lose, has already plummeted. Therefore, in medical lawsuits, the loss of reputation suffered by doctors is huge, while money, spirit, and body are secondary. Even if the falsely accusing patient is later compensated by the court, the former reputation cannot be restored in a short time, let alone if there is no compensation at all. Some people think that the patient's accusation against the doctor is not completely intentional false accusation, but mostly due to their lack of legal knowledge, which is understandable. But the study of medicine is very specialized, and it is common for diseases to be incurable. Whether the patient died from the disease or from the doctor is difficult for even medical experts to observe objectively, let alone for patients who know nothing about medicine. Therefore, in terms of legal knowledge, patients are merely insufficient, but in terms of medical knowledge, patients have none at all. To speak recklessly without knowledge is either out of temporary anger or out of intentional extortion. If compensation is not required, how can the number of medical lawsuits be reduced in the future? Therefore, I hereby express this to the medical community, to the patients who sue, and to the arbitrary judges.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(59) Acute Articular Rheumatism</p>
<p>(Question) What is acute articular rheumatism?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is a disease in which multiple joints acutely become painful and swollen, and the whole body is feverish.</p>
<p>(Question) How does this disease occur?</p>
<p>(Answer) This disease is also an infectious disease, but the pathogen is unknown. It is probably an infection of streptococcus or staphylococcus, which occurs as a heterotypic or epidemic state.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the triggers for this disease?</p>
<p>(Answer) Colds are often triggers for acute rheumatism; secondly, unsuitable housing and bad weather can also trigger this disease. It is especially prone to occur in the season of moldy rain and humidity.</p>
<p>(Question) Is there a relationship between this disease and occupation and age?</p>
<p>(Answer) Those who engage in rough labor, such as rickshaw pullers and maids, are most likely to suffer from this disease. The age group of 15 to 35 years old is the most common.</p>
<p>(Question) When acute articular rheumatism is about to occur, what are the initial signs?</p>
<p>(Answer) The patient feels tired all over the body, easily fatigued, and the limbs are stiff. There are also various mucosal inflammation symptoms.</p>
<p>(Question) After the disease has already occurred, what symptoms appear?</p>
<p>(Answer) The joints are affected very rapidly, especially the large joints of the lower limbs; then multiple joints are affected. In most cases, the disease spreads from one joint to another immediately.</p>
<p>(Question) Does the patient's body have a fever like other infectious diseases?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes. But the fever is not very high. It rarely exceeds 39 degrees Celsius. The rise in temperature follows the course of the joint disease. Whenever a new joint is affected, the body temperature will rise once.</p>
<p>(Question) Are there systemic symptoms at the same time as the fever?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes, sometimes. Like headaches, dizziness, and hot flashes, etc.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the local diseases that occur in the joints in acute articular rheumatism?</p>
<p>(Answer) It mainly affects the synovial membrane of the joint, the joint capsule, or the tendon sheath, and the mucous bursa; occasionally it affects the muscle membrane and muscle sheath. Initially, inflammation occurs in the large joints, especially the knee, foot, elbow, or hand joints, then it spreads to the shoulder and hip joints, and finally it affects the small joints such as the wrist, ankle, and fingers. The affected joints generally show redness, swelling, heat sensation, and pain, which are the typical symptoms of inflammation. The pain is very severe, so the movement of each joint is hindered.</p>
<p>(Question) Do changes occur in the circulatory system at this time?</p>
<p>(Answer) Acute articular rheumatism often affects the heart; therefore, it is often associated with endocarditis, pericarditis, and myocarditis.</p>
<p>(Question) What about endocarditis?</p>
<p>(Answer) In endocarditis during rheumatism, the mitral valve or aortic valve is most often affected. Warts form on the inner surface of the valve. As a result, mitral valve insufficiency or stenosis, and aortic valve insufficiency occur.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(51) Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (commonly known as otorrhea)</p>
<p>Speaking of a symptom of chronic suppurative otitis media, it is generally known as otorrhea. It mostly comes from the transfer of acute otitis media. As seen in clinical diagnosis, this disease accounts for the largest number of various diseases in otology. It is especially common in childhood. This is because the causes of acute otitis media (such as measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough, smallpox, pneumonia, etc.) are also most common in childhood. Among them, especially in</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>When suffering from acute otitis media, without proper treatment, or due to malnutrition, or due to adenoid weakness, it is easier to transfer and become chronic suppurative otitis media.</p>
<p>The most obvious suffering felt by patients with chronic suppurative otitis media is hearing loss and tinnitus. Sometimes pain, headache, head heaviness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and staggering gait can occur. If we use an otoscope to examine, we can see that the external auditory canal often has erosion. Pus exists in the depths. The nature of the pus is different. Sometimes it is muco-purulent. Sometimes it is purely purulent. The pus sometimes emits a specific foul odor. Its amount varies, and there is no certainty. If this purulent secretion is wiped clean, the perforation of the eardrum can be observed. The location, shape, and size of the perforation are different. However, the eardrum perforation of this disease is mostly a large perforation. It will never be as small as that of acute otitis media. When the disease is severe, the eardrum can be completely missing. There is usually only one perforation. The shapes are mostly round, oval, heart-shaped or kidney-shaped. The location is usually only two types: central and marginal. When the entire eardrum is missing, or in the case of a large perforation, the mucosa of the tympanic cavity is often seen. It is rose-red, or yellowish-red, or purplish-red. It is often swollen. The surface is either smooth or uneven. Granular granulation occurs. Sometimes it forms a pedunculated aural polyp. Therefore, it hinders the discharge of pus, and causes many dangerous complications. In addition, there are so-called middle ear cholesteatomas. It can often break down bone. This is also a sign that is very easy to cause dangerous complications. As for the most dangerous period of this disease, it is when obvious bone ulcers and osteomyelitis form. Secondary meningitis, brain abscess, sinus thrombosis, pyemia, or severe massive hemorrhage caused by the disease eroding the blood vessel wall, etc. Because they all have a bearing on life, I dare not say the prognosis of this disease is good, and I dare not say it is bad. However, in patients who are physically strong and well-nourished, if proper treatment can be performed early, dangerous results can be avoided and a cure can be obtained. However, the otorrhea patients I have seen in clinical practice have mostly had the disease for one or two years if less, and more than ten years if more. Some have even reached old age. At this time, the disease is unusually complicated. If you want to completely cure it, it is not easy. At the same time, it is still necessary to prevent the arrival of dangerous complications. Therefore, this disease is best to implement appropriate treatment early. Do not delay the time. It is necessary not to treat it.</p>
<h3>Popular Talk on Modern Venereology (5)</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengbai (Compiled) Yin Muqiang (Proofread)</p>
<p>Chapter 7 On the Treatment of Syphilis</p>
<p>Mercury and iodides have long been effective drugs for syphilis. Recently, there have been arsenic and bismuth agents.</p>
<p>Looking at the history of syphilis treatment, our country is not inferior to Europe and the West. The administration of mercury preparations was already seen in the Zhou Dynasty. According to medical records of the Zhou Dynasty, light powder was often used to treat damp poison. The components of the medicine and the goal of treatment were in line with mercury preparations. Other treatments, such as Smilax glabra and Tenfuling for treating scabies, are also the same in nature as Sassafras, which was used to treat malignant minor poisons in Western history. Unfortunately, later generations did not study it and there was no progress.</p>
<p>Since the 20th century, effective drugs have emerged one after another. However, the above-mentioned several types still do not lose their inherent value. As for the adaptation of each drug, it is said that arsenic preparations should be used in the first stage (Sal-v-arsan 606 is its representative). Mercury preparations are used in the second stage (injectables have recently been changed to bismuth preparations because of their peaceful nature and few side effects). Iodide is used in the third stage. However, one must not be too rigid. The most appropriate method is mixed therapy. (That is, arsenic preparations are the main ones, supplemented by other preparations.) This is because when two different drugs act on the pathogen at the same time, their sterilization effect is more significant than using one alone.</p>
<p>The earlier syphilis-specific drugs are used, the more obvious the effect. As the disease progresses, the effect weakens. Therefore, a definite diagnosis must be made as early as possible when the initial hard chancre is discovered. Begin full treatment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when administering drugs, we should also find ways to avoid drug resistance (Arzneifest). Drug resistance refers to the fact that when chemical drugs act on pathogens, the residual pathogens develop resistance to the chemical drug due to insufficient drug dosage, resulting in ineffectiveness when administered again. The existence of this chemical resistance can be transmitted to ten or hundreds of generations without end. Therefore, insufficient treatment of syphilis not only fails to alleviate its symptoms, but also increases the resistance of the pathogen to the drug, and makes those who are subsequently poisoned fall into an irreparable situation. Now, looking at the social situation, any prostitute or any person infected with poison is almost in a state of drug resistance. This is why the disease cannot be eradicated and the spread of poison is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Witnessing this crisis, Hoftmann advocated the so-called extreme dose therapy. The American medical community even continued to use arsenic and bismuth preparations for injection for one year in an attempt to completely eradicate the poison. This can be called an unusual army in the syphilis treatment field. Recently, countries in the East and West have followed suit and achieved remarkable results. However, in our country, due to the decline of scientific knowledge and insufficient economic capacity, it is difficult to see its implementation. It still needs our supervision and hopes for self-reflection from patients.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 The Problem of Syphilis Prevention</p>
<p>Preventive medicine occupies an important page in the medical field of the 20th century. Syphilis is no exception. However, syphilis prevention is not like the use of preventive vaccines for cholera and typhoid fever, nor is it like the isolation of leprosy. It is also not comparable to cleaning food and drinks for cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery. Since we know that the first medium for transmitting syphilis is sexual intercourse, then to achieve the purpose of prevention, ideally, banning sexual intercourse is the most appropriate. Unfortunately, this is not possible in reality. Therefore, the problem of syphilis prevention is more difficult than other infectious diseases. Now, let's discuss it in terms of general prevention and individual prevention.</p>
<p>(A) General Prevention Since the harm of syphilis affects society and the country, general prevention is essential.</p>
<p>Zi. Legal and Compulsory Prohibition A Prostitution Problem Since prostitutes are the location of syphilis nests, the disposal of prostitutes is an important part of prevention. Therefore, there is advocacy for</p>
<p>(1) Abolishing Prostitution Although abolishing prostitution is a simple method of preventing syphilis, if we do not find a way to resettle these abolished prostitutes, it will cause them to be displaced and easily change from public to secret. The proliferation of private prostitutes in countries that have abolished prostitution (such as the United States) is due to this.</p>
<p>(2) Public Prostitution System and Venereal Disease Examination Movement This is to implement regular inspections under police supervision. Those who are poisonous are prohibited from receiving customers. Those who are non-toxic are allowed to engage in the industry. However, superficial and incomplete inspections are ineffective. If strict inspections are carried out, it can be concluded that all prostitutes will be banned as poisonous. This will cause major social problems. Although, there are indeed flaws in the implementation of public prostitution and venereal disease examination. However, according to the percentage of knot calculations, it has indeed decreased significantly. It seems to still have its value. It is worth emulating.</p>
<h3>The Medicine of Pain Relief (19)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>People ask, how exactly does one relieve pain? The method of pain relief that is in line with pathology should first be the hydrotherapy and heat therapy method of pain relief. This method can be said to be completely beneficial and harmless. This method is the hot compress method. It is better to use a saturated solution of cold and hot magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate solution has the effect of eliminating movement and relieving pain, and is completely harmless to the body. In addition to magnesium sulfate, the heat of water is also very important. When heat is applied, the blood vessels in the boil area will dilate. When the blood vessels dilate, the tension in the affected area can be relaxed, and the pain is reduced accordingly. Apply a short-term cold compress immediately after applying heat, which can prolong vasodilation and prolong the effect. In addition to the relaxation effect, increasing the blood flow rate also increases the function of excreting toxins, and the benefits are not small. It is also quite good to apply analgesic ointment or lotion.</p>
<p>The first point to note is to avoid danger. We know that bacteria can easily enter the blood from boils. If it invades the blood, it will be difficult to save, so when the boil matures, the boil should be cut off or the feet should be cut off to allow pus and toxins to flow out of the incision to reduce the risk of invading the blood. As for furuncles, some people think that surgery is not possible. This kind of argument can be considered reasonable, but it can also be considered unreasonable. It is reasonable to say that it is useless to have surgery too late for furuncles. It is unreasonable to say that death after a knife for a long furuncle cannot be considered to be caused by the surgery, because the patient will die without surgery. According to the opinion of a famous surgeon, furuncles should be operated on earlier, because performing appropriate surgical operations can indeed reduce the mortality rate. If the surgical operation is too late and cannot save the patient, it can be avoided.</p>
<p>Cellulitis is a type of acute disseminated inflammation in tissues. The reason is that toxic bacteria invade the skin and flesh, causing suppuration, ulceration, or gangrene. Cellulitis often starts in the legs, hands, or face. The onset is often an inflammation that starts from a small break in the skin and spreads to the entire limb in a short period of time, which is similar to the saying, "A single spark can start a prairie fire." The bacterium that causes this disease is often streptococcus. On the one hand, this bacterium causes severe acute inflammation in the area, and on the other hand, it often invades and endangers the patient's life in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The principle of treating this serious problem is roughly the same as the principle of treating boils. Pain can be relieved as much as possible within the possible range, but do not misuse anesthetics and oral painkillers to reduce the patient's resistance. The urgent task of saving life is to cut open the rotten area greatly to allow toxins to flow out, and at the same time, the gauze applied to the wound should be soaked in concentrated liquid to absorb toxins. At this time, it is more hopeful to use surgical operations to save lives. Never hinder the operation to cut off a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>An abscess is a local suppuration. An abscess is similar to a boil at the beginning, but it is larger than a boil. At first, the best way to reduce swelling and relieve pain is hydrotherapy with cold and hot compresses, the effects of which are detailed above. Secondly, lifting up the swollen area and resting can often prevent suppuration. If you want to avoid suppuration and surgery, faithfully implement the above principles. This will not only relieve pain but also prevent pain before it happens. If pus has already formed, the least painful way is to have surgery to release the pus. Once the pus is released, the pain can be reduced by eighty or ninety percent. Not having surgery will cause more pain, the pain will last longer, and there is also danger.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoid pain</p>
<p>The lower end of the large intestine and the anus are extremely prone to problems. When there is a problem, there will be pain every time you have a bowel movement. If the pain is not treated, it can last for ten or twenty years without healing. Ordinary people often say, "(Nine out of ten people have hemorrhoids,") although this statement is inevitably exaggerated, it can be seen that there are not a few people who suffer from hemorrhoids. Only true scientific medicine can relieve the patient's pain. The pathology, prevention methods, pain relief, and treatment methods of hemorrhoids are briefly described below for readers' reference. Hemorrhoids are divided into external hemorrhoids and internal hemorrhoids. The following is a brief description of each.</p>
<p>Among external hemorrhoids, the more common one is thrombosed external hemorrhoids, which are found outside the anus and range in size from soybeans to walnuts. The larger it is, the more painful it is. The reason for the development of this type of external hemorrhoid is often that coughing or forceful rupture of the venous tubes in the anus causes blood to flow under the skin to form a blood clot, which is thrombosed hemorrhoid. Sometimes inflammation of the veins at the lower end of the rectum can also cause thrombosed hemorrhoids. The characteristic of this type of hemorrhoid is that there is no hemorrhoid in normal times, but it is suddenly discovered. This type of external hemorrhoid is most painful at the beginning due to the tension of the blood clot. When the hemorrhoid is large, it is unbearable to walk, sit, or lie down.</p>
<p>The most effective and reasonable method for relieving this type of pain is to use a little local anesthetic to cut open the hemorrhoid and squeeze out the blood clot, so that the pain is completely eliminated in a short period of time. The wound will be completely healed in just a few days. If this method is not used and palliative treatment methods are used, such as applying analgesic ointment, having a bowel movement every day, and using hot and cold compresses, the blood clot can gradually disappear on its own. However, the pain must be prolonged for one or two weeks. Sometimes an abscess can also develop in the hemorrhoid, because bacteria are very easy to grow in old blood clots. If it becomes a sore, the pain will be prolonged. Note that external hemorrhoids cannot be treated with injections. This is the general treatment method for thrombosed external hemorrhoids, and patients can choose for themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding the clinical symptoms of this disease, there are not many that can be specifically mentioned; diarrhea is a very important symptom, but constipation may also occur sometimes. Abdominal depression and abdominal pain are mostly absent. In addition, there are anemia, weakness, emaciation, and other systemic conditions; increased temperature is also very common, but it is impossible to determine whether it occurs in the intestine or in the lungs. Sometimes, in the cecum part of the lower abdomen, a tumor can be found just by going through the touch examination procedure: this is also a type of intestinal tuberculosis, the so-called ileocecal tuberculosis. His passage is generally very slow; because of the atrophy and hardening of the intestine here, the intestinal orifice is also unusually narrow. This type of patient is mostly adolescents during the youth period, and recovery requires surgery. Proof of tubercle bacilli in the feces cannot be taken as evidence of this disease, as this can be caused by swallowed phlegm. The examination of the intestinal part of the light is of great help in the diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis; the detailed situation in this area is, of course, not so clear to those other than experts.</p>
<p>The treatment of intestinal tuberculosis can be divided into two aspects: one is diet control therapy, and the other is drug therapy. Regarding food control, if the sufferer has constipation, all mild laxatives must be used with caution, and it is best to eat more fruits and fresh vegetables. If diarrhea symptoms occur, then foods such as cabbage, snap beans, fatty meats, and cold drinks should be prohibited, or at least reduced to a considerable extent. It is best to add a little lime water to the internal service of milk: coffee should also be prohibited. Keeping the abdomen warm is beneficial to abuse, so various therapies such as sun lamps are helpful. In drug therapy, astringents are the most important: agents such as blood powder, kaolin, tannic acid, and 　 are very suitable. Long-term injection of calcium agents is also very beneficial for diarrhea symptoms. The application of opium preparations has the effect of stopping diarrhea and relieving pain.</p>
<h3>A Simple Explanation of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (5)(6)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 4 Digestive Organs (Continued)</p>
<p>The place where it occurs is most common in the lower part of the iliac intestine, and the upper part of the large intestine is also very common; ulcers are found on the intestinal mucosa in this place, and small nodules can be recognized, the so-called tuberculous slick ulcer is. This type of ulcer can sometimes heal due to scab formation: but new ulcers mostly continue to 　 occur in nearby places.</p>

<h3>The State of Secondary Education in Our Country</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The underdevelopment of education in our country is a clear and obvious fact. According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Education, the number of people receiving secondary education in our country is only twelve per ten thousand, ranking twenty-sixth when compared to major countries around the world. From this, one can imagine how far behind our country's education is.</p>
<p>In all civilized countries around the world, primary education is a form of compulsory education. All children within the country, upon reaching school age, have an obligation to receive primary education. Not only that, it is said that some countries have even implemented a compulsory system for secondary education. However, in our country, not to mention secondary education, even primary education, though nominally designated as compulsory, is actually received by very few school-age children nationwide.</p>
<p>But based on the facts, secondary education should also be listed as a form of compulsory education. This is because in today's complex social environment, a young person needs adequate abilities to cope, and a few years of primary education is simply not enough. However, given the current state of education in our country, hoping to enforce compulsory secondary education is impossible. But finding ways to gradually popularize secondary education should be an issue that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The underdevelopment of secondary education in our country has many causes. For example, the lack of educational funding, the shortage of educational talent, and the weak capacity of the people to afford secondary education are all factors. Another reason is the lack of widespread primary education. The solution, of course, should be to improve the situation from all aspects.</p>
<h3>Random Notes, Part 1</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>Recently, there seems to be a trend toward revivalism, and as a result, the images of the past have been stirred up in the minds of many.</p>
<p>Naturally, its value is evaluated differently depending on each person's perceptions. Is this evaluation genuine or false? This, it seems, has not yet been definitively determined. Perhaps it's because of the passion for revivalism? No, rather than the passion for revivalism, it's more appropriate to say it's the extension of divine authority. Underneath this, for some reason, people's faith in gods has become remarkably strong recently. Yes, "gods" can control people's minds, "gods" can bestow blessings or bring disaster, and "gods" can also satisfy the different desires that different people cherish in their hearts.</p>
<p>Every person, unless there is a deficiency in their constitution, naturally has a kind of aspiration. Some of these aspirations are limited to the present, while others transcend reality and reach intangible fantasies. Thus, burning incense and worshiping Buddha arise in response to the times. Saying this may be a bit flawed, because burning incense and worshiping Buddha have a long history and are not sudden occurrences in reality. However, based on the lack of spiritual sustenance, this form has become even more widespread.</p>
<p>Recently, I received news from someone from Xiaoshan that a ferry departing from Shaoxing to the Yuemiao Temple in Xiaoshan, while passing the Zunyi Bridge, suddenly</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>encountered several bandits who ordered it to stop. They immediately boarded the boat and thoroughly searched it. All the male and female, old and young pilgrims, totaling over thirty people, were searched one by one, and none were spared. However, as the amount of silver was not much, they stripped all the pilgrims of their clothes, resulting in a total loss estimated at over two hundred yuan.</p>
<p>In the news above, we get a sense that so-called divine authority, so-called spiritual efficacy, are nothing more than deceptive tricks. If not, those men and women who travel far with boundless enthusiasm to offer incense should not have received such an unpleasant experience!</p>
<h3>Director Zhang of the Village</h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>In the courtyard, two tall osmanthus trees had already bloomed with branches full of golden flowers in the early autumn season, but the weather was as hot as in the middle of summer. Passersby outside the wall often rested at the foot of the wall, and the rich fragrance inexplicably comforted their senses. Even more, some leaned against the wall and comfortably dozed off. The children nearby loved these tiny flowers even more, but Director Zhang's prestige in the town made them afraid to brazenly ask the adults to fetch them, so they often climbed in from the corner of the wall at great risk to pick them secretly.</p>
<p>Facing the courtyard was Director Zhang's bedroom. Every day, after smoking his fill of opium, he would hide behind the window curtains with his wife's maid, Qiuxiang, deliberately watching the children stealing on the high wall, taking it as amusement. Qiuxiang was even more clever at guessing the director's thoughts, so Director Zhang's days were naturally very comfortable.</p>
<p>His first wife was a virtuous woman who, after more than ten years of marriage, had not borne him a son or daughter. She felt that a woman who failed to fulfill her duty of bearing children was letting her husband down. She also suspected that she had committed some injustice in her previous life, resulting in her childlessness in this life. She told the director her thoughts and, on one hand, hired workers to build a Buddhist hall next to their house, and on the other hand, advised the director to take her dowry maid as a concubine, so that she could piously worship Buddha and cultivate blessings for her next life.</p>
<p>Director Zhang had long harbored improper thoughts about Qiuxiang, but he had been hindered by his wife's eyes and had only dared to touch her secretly on more than one occasion. Now, following his wife's orders, he had the study in the back courtyard renovated, planting seasonal flowers and plants throughout the courtyard, and locking himself in his bedroom every day. However, as the director of the town, his affairs and revenue were equally troublesome. In the past, he used to go to the teahouse every afternoon, which was almost his office, because by that time, all the tea drinkers had left, and those who waited there with unpleasant faces were all Director Zhang's clients. From the flow of money to heinous crimes, everything depended on Director Zhang's word to determine right and wrong. Moreover, his judgments were the law, and no one dared to utter a single objection. Besides, Director Zhang himself had said that he was an honest official and had never wronged anyone. This reputation of Director Zhang and his income simultaneously dominated the highest power in the town.</p>
<p>Since he had acquired Qiuxiang, he entrusted this important responsibility to his trusted follower, Zhang Er Ye. Zhang Er Ye's original name was Agou, and he was Director Zhang's tenant farmer. It was said that he had a beautiful wife who, after being raped by Director Zhang, committed suicide out of shame, and only then did Agou become Director Zhang's follower. However, Agou had a nimble mouth and a shrewd mind. He did not resent Director Zhang for forcing his wife to her death, but instead catered to his master's wishes in every way, committing all kinds of evil deeds. As a result, Zhang Er Ye's name spread. In fact, this was the intention of others who cursed him as Director Zhang's son. Agou did not think so thoroughly. Hearing the words "Zhang Er Ye," he beamed, naturally pleasing his master, Director Zhang, even more.</p>
<p>These days, the wife was sick, and Qiuxiang had gone to the Buddhist hall. Agou was always waiting in the director's room. To relieve the director's loneliness, he came up with an idea that made the director jump up from the opium bed like a spring.</p>
<p>The sun had already set, and Director Zhang, after smoking an excessive amount of opium, still felt unwell all over. The osmanthus flowers in the courtyard, like a charming woman, tempted him. "Damn it, why isn't she back yet!" He clenched his right fist, hitting his own left hand, and slowly paced to the front, unexpectedly bumping into a short figure at the side of the door.</p>
<p>"Director, Agou deserves to die!" Zhang Er Ye's figure seemed even shorter.</p>
<p>"Why are you being so sneaky!" the director said with a smile. "Did it succeed?" Then he turned back and walked towards the opium bed, and Agou followed closely like a shadow.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Director! I spent half a day talking, using both soft and hard tactics... haha," he immediately lowered his voice and whispered into the director's ear, "Now, at my house..."</p>
<p>"You've worked hard, Agou!" The director pushed him onto the opium bed. "Have a puff!" While laughing, he stroked his upper lip and spun around the room.</p>
<h3>When There's Food to Eat</h3>
<p>— Qing Quan</p>
<h3>Da Ben Zhen</h3>
<p>— Li Ni</p>
<p>Here, there is only a long and wide road, lying quietly in the scorching sun of the southern country, as if in a state of extreme fatigue. A gust of wind swept by, and suddenly waves of rolling dust surged from the ground, hazy like the yellow sandstorms of winter in the northern country, making people's eyes very uncomfortable. The Ben Zhen River flows year-round with peach-red water, gently rippling, like a bed of brocade, winding leisurely, crossing this long road, interweaving into a cross shape. A tall wooden bridge spans the river, connecting the road, allowing cars and trucks to rumble across the bridge. The heavy trucks make a rumbling sound that often startles people from their sweet dreams in the tranquil afternoon, causing them to open their sleepy eyes and look at the scorching blue sky, suspecting that it is the city noise before a storm.</p>
<p>When the road directly from Da Ben Zhen to Singapore was not yet completed a few years ago, there were regular small steamers traveling between Singapore. The transportation of all goods depended entirely on this beautiful and secluded Ben Zhen River with its peach-red waters. Now that land transportation has been completed, the small steamers have lost their original position and power and have been eliminated. Only the small pier on the river still stands alone, as if refusing to accept its fate, glaring at the tall wooden bridge.</p>
<p>From the appearance of Da Ben Zhen, it hardly seems to be a commercial port. There are no towering chimneys spewing light and wispy smoke; there are no majestic buildings; even the flickering electric lights are absent; not to mention its entertainment venues. Here, there is only this unique long and dusty road. Along the river, a section is dotted with a hundred or so low and simple attap houses, which are where the overseas Chinese gather to buy and sell, forming this small "Shan Ba" "rural" town.</p>
<p>In addition to these hundred or so shops, Da Ben Zhen is surrounded by vast and towering betel nut and rubber trees, green like a vast blue sea, standing neatly. Rubber and betel nuts are their main products each year, and they are also the lifeline that constitutes the commercial prosperity of this small town. However, the drastic drop in rubber prices in recent years, the sluggishness, and the poor harvest of betel nuts have made the commerce of this small town even more desolate!</p>
<p>It can be said that the natives of Da Ben Zhen are completely assimilated by the overseas Chinese. No trace of their crude barbarity remains. Their customs are simple, they are extremely warm and sincere to people, and they have a spirit of courtesy, showing the demeanor of people from civilized countries.</p>
<p>Every time in the quiet night, when all sounds are silent, I always like to drag my wooden slippers alone, walking rhythmically on the wooden bridge over the Ben Zhen River, leaning on the railing, admiring the full and bright moon in the mid-sky, counting the twinkling stars, and reminiscing about my distant homeland, or looking at the faint shadows of the bushes on both sides of the river, and the light fishing boats as light as feathers, shuttling back and forth under the bridge, singing oars, and disappearing like smoke in a short while.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the mournful and melancholic Malay music mixed with heart-wrenching soft songs is intermittently transmitted from the distant yachts, the tragic tone lingering in my ears vibrates my heartstrings, often evoking the desolate emotions in my heart, and I shed tears of sadness!</p>
<p>However, the beautiful, tranquil, and secluded atmosphere of Da Ben Zhen, like an ancient town, when recalled at this time, makes me yearn for it endlessly.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Star News Zero</h3>
<p>(1) Hu Jia asked for leave to travel to Hong Kong and unfortunately contracted pneumonia. He has now been admitted to Dr. Wei's Hospital in Hong Kong for treatment. Once he recovers, he will return to Shanghai to cancel his leave.</p>
<p>(2) Shen Xiling's directed film "Nostalgia" had a surprising success at the test screening at the Central Grand Theatre. The film will be released soon.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Shichuan's directed sound dialogue film "The Big Family" has been filming in the Star Second Studio for days, and the work is very intense.</p>
<p>(4) Zheng Zhengqiu, Li Pingqian, and Wu Cun have been working hard in the directing department for days, writing new works, and now most of them have been completed.</p>
<p>(5) Xu Xinfu's new work "Jade Horse" is a detective film against drugs. It stars Yan Yuexian, Gong Jianong, and Wang Zhengxin. The whole play is full of tension and can be compared with imported films.</p>
<p>(6) The new studio of Star Company is about to begin construction.</p>
<p>(7) Zhou Jianyun and his wife and Ms. Hu Die arrived in Geneva on the 6th of this month. "Sister Flowers" and "Orchid in an Empty Valley" and other films were shown publicly in the area. The Chinese representative office of the League of Nations held a banquet for Zhou Hu on the 7th, and the situation was extremely warm. Zhou Hu planned to stay in Geneva for two days and then travel to Rome. They will leave Europe and return to China on the Luso around the 13th.</p>
<h3>Shen Xiling's Third Creation "Nostalgia"</h3>
<p>In the far away Northeast, the beautiful family of Gao Zhipin was scattered and displaced by the fire. She took her elderly mother and a neurotic hunchbacked servant and drifted to Shanghai. Intoxicated with paper and drunk, she sat singing all night. Shanghai's prosperity remained the same. While suffering from the oppression of life, they watched the walking dead intoxicated with life and death. A piece of nostalgia aroused Gao Zhipin's infinite grief and indignation. Later, after experiencing vicissitudes, she finally solved the problem of life, but Shanghai was not a place to live and work in peace. She encountered a second upheaval.</p>
<p>"Nostalgia" seriously tells us that if each of us is living a life of intoxication and muddleheadedness, then everyone is in danger of losing their home at any time.</p>
<p>This is Shen Xiling's third creation. In Nostalgia, he entrusted his infinite sorrow for his homeland with the strong sense of justice of a poet.</p>
<h3>The "Downtown" in "Goddess of Freedom" is completely "sealed off" due to the economic downturn</h3>
<p>Business is indeed difficult to do this year. Everywhere they are clamoring for "big discounts" and "big auctions," but they are still experiencing an economic downturn everywhere. Unexpectedly, this economic downturn has been reflected like an infectious disease in the third sound film "Freedom God" of the Electric Communications Company. It turned out that when "Freedom God" was shooting the Guangzhou street rain scene last night, shops suddenly sprang up in the open-air studio. Fresh fruit shops, shoe stores, butcher shops, wine shops, etc., actually did business under the mercury lamps, and the newly opened shops were indeed twice as profitable, showing a sense of serving those who were unwilling. However, a torrential rain suddenly poured down, and the cameraman Yang Jimin's camera swept wildly, and all the essence of the "city" in "Freedom God" was in the "seal off".</p>
<h3>After "The Beginning of Man"</h3>
<p>"The Beginning of Man" is a masterpiece by Shi Dongshan of Yihua Film Company. It is currently being shown at the Jincheng Grand Theater and has garnered much praise from various newspaper film publications. The audience has been quite crowded in recent days. Following "The Beginning of Man," Jincheng has decided to screen Yue Ming's "Madness." "Madness" is starred by Wu Lizhu, our country's only martial arts star. In addition to all the dialogues and songs being voiced, it also features various colors such as red, yellow, and blue. It is both audible and visual. "Madness" has set a new record for domestic films, so film fans will definitely be scrambling to crowd the theater when it is released.</p>
<p>The Performing Arts Laboratory Enrolls Free Students</p>
<p>The "Performing Arts Laboratory" founded by playwright Liu Yawei and others is scheduled to officially begin classes on the 17th of this month, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM.
