<h3>美國中立與國際制裁</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>際此日內瓦方面下對意。實施制裁之决心之時昂然。於國際聯盟系統之外者尚有美日及。德意志三大國而此三國之中。尤以美國爲最可注意一九一四年大戰期內美。國以中立國資格。力主海上自由而與英國海軍在海上發生至嚴。重之齟齬微德國之潛艇。政策則英美間之决戰或難避免。有此教訓倫敦當局於任何國際制裁。必考慮美國之態度蓋無論。在貿易上在武力上美國均有。力量破壞國際制裁之網而。使日內瓦之行動失。效也然數年以來美國人士亦。憬然悔悟歐洲大戰。期內之不智因商人之圖。利銀行家之投資而卒使美國。加入不必要之戰爭戰爭。結果雖得暫時之經濟繁榮。然曾幾何時戰後之不景氣伸入美。國至今千萬左右之失業人。民仍受歐戰之餘毒故主張永不。捲入世界大戰而自動的放。棄一部分海上自由及中立國權利者亦大有。人在數月前國會通過之中立法案。數日前頒佈之禁止對交戰國軍火。輸出令卽根據此項願望及覺悟而。起者</p>
<p>吾人目前所應注意者卽在。此中立法案之下當國聯實施。對意制裁時中立國之美國有。否與國聯諾國發生衝突之機會耶根。據紕約消息前美國國務卿史汀。生投函紐約泰晤士報則謂美國。之禁止軍火輸出尚不足以挽回美國捲入。漩渦之危機美國棉花與其他貨物之售與。意國不久將引起美國與瞬聯會員。國之嚴重衝突故史汀生主張擴大美。國與國聯之合作以制止意阿戰爭夫中立主義與制裁。主義之不能相容乃國際。法上至明顯之事制裁者以團體之力。阻北及懲罰團體中一分子之違法也中立。者不問團體意見如何而每個。份子不作主張或是或非誰曲誰直完全不管。僅作隔岸觀火而不對任何一方取。敵對或親善之行故禁止軍火必及意。阿二國而不限於對意限制貿易亦。不厚於此而薄於彼今羅斯福總統宣佈之。禁令所謂軍火範圍至窄棉花銅。鐵可供意大利之製造軍火者並未禁止。出口而此類物件輸入阿比西尼亞則落後之。黑人國决不能化爲軍火此中立。而不中立者也中立法案本年通過。者並未有禁止放債及賖帳。於交戰國之規定而國聯之財政制裁計畫。則包括此項使美國銀行家甘冒。此不韙則以美國之財力大可以增意。大利之戰鬬力而於阿比西尼亞。則無裨益此又中立而不中立者也。諸如此類均可引起日內。瓦與華盛頓之衝突而所謂日。內瓦與華盛頓之衝突無異於英美。二國之衝突蓋大西洋上惟些二國。有鉅大之海軍耳。　雖然美國之破壞國際制。裁工作與否完全視此次戰爭。擴大範圍與延續時問而定如。戰爭爲短期的爲地方的則美國决。不願因營利之故而使其國家重入一九一七。之錯　設或不然因意大利之利誘及。戰期中之海外市塲之大發達彼充滿。剩餘資本與剩餘生產品工人農　無。業可爲之美國必不能禁利之引誘。及不能忍受海外貿易因國際制裁而起之。扣失而與英國有所衝突星星之。火可以燎原美國民意爲感情的。因中立國權利之被損而捲入大戰亦可能之事也。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （闌刪）</p>
<p>蓮花出污泥而不染，亭亭潔立，風致嫣然。然則在惡濁的環境中，難道就沒有一個潔身自好的人嗎？</p>
<p>古今來賢哲，都教人隱惡而揚善為個人的私　，可是人們都有一種劣根性，見他人有些好處，每不屑談及，以為這樣可以形低了自己；但風聞人家有分毫壞事，便採為談話之資，口如懸河，加以各式配料。又以為這樣可以形高了自己了吧？</p>
<p>黄包車的橡皮輪子走了氣，旣軟且　，車夫拿打氣筒向它抽了幾下，馬上漲得滿滿的了。我們有時為憂煩所襲，愁眉不展，此時如輪子之走了氣；如果得到高貴的友情的安慰和鼓勵，不禁萬慮全消，又可振作起來，正如給打過氣的輪子一樣。是以適當的鼓勵，確有莫大的效力。</p>
<h3>醒世小言</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>歎窮道苦，只是詛咒着自己與寶貴無緣，可是也儘有人塞翁得馬，反而遭禍的。</p>
<p>我有一位老表弟，在某一期航空獎券裏，打中了五千塊錢的獎金，接着便接得了若干封匿名信，極盡恐嚇之能事，自然都在想分得一盃羹。</p>
<p>老表弟接了這些匿名信之後，要報警，恐眞有暴徒光降。遲疑不決，神魂顚倒了好幾天。某一晚，樓下同居的夫婦倆，突然的打起架來，一個花瓶墜地，嚇得他認為匪徒來了，忙忙的避上晒臺，一失足，掉下樓梯，震　了大腦，在醫院裏躺了五天，便死了。</p>
<p>還有一位同學的，不得意了若干年，今年春間，得奧援而得意了。可是到差了不到半月，忽然害起病來了。一病方愈，一病又起。纏纏綿綿的三好二歹，足有五個月，病還是不輕不重。雖然儘能起床走走坐坐，但只是不能辦事。</p>
<p>到了第六個月裏，忽得了一道另候任用的命令。</p>
<p>當時他因病着，所以雖然停職了，倒也無所謂。可是他自從接得停職令後，說也奇怪，病倒一天好似一天起來，半月後，健康已回復了十之七信。</p>
<p>還有，我鄉間，有一位隣居的女兒，因不愜於伊的未婚夫，而鬧着離婚。離婚之後，嫁給了別一位靑年。不料結婚之後，不上半年，丈夫暴病身死了，祇是只得孤單單的度着凄涼的生活。</p>
<p>雖然這年頭兒，命運論是落伍了，但我覺得冥冥中，似乎仍有支配者在。</p>
<h3>池魚考正</h3>
<p>— 梅愛</p>
<p>讀二十五日春秋，有某君（署名已忘）所作：「殃及池魚」一文。略謂：「楚賢士池仲魚，以鄰家失火，蔓延罹禍，當時遂有此諺，後世沿用旣久，數典忘祖，輙誤為池中之魚。」因斥：「今人讀書，不求甚解。」顧某君未能指其出處，讀者不無遺憾。且以予所知，此事之見於古籍者，其說各異。不可不為之考正　。</p>
<p>按，潤鑑類函引風俗通云：「城門失火，禍及池中魚。百家書：「宋城門失火，自取池中水以沃之，魚悉露見」。是池魚固非人名，且為宋國事也。而淮南子云：「楚土亡其猿，而林木為之殘：宋君亡其珠，池中魚為之殫。」日知錄亦云：「此事祖於呂氏春秋：宋桓司　，有寶珠，投之池中，竭池求之，无得，鱼死焉。」此言祸福之相及也」。则「失火」与「池鱼」，自是两事。卽以亡珠事论，淮南子谓为「宋君」；吕氏春秋謂為：「宋桓司馬」。亦未知孰是也？</p>
<p>若某君所言，殆本於東魏杜弼檄梁文：「楚國亡猿，禍延林木：專門失火，殃及池魚」。復稽諸廣韵：「古有池中魚者，城門失火，仲魚燒死，故諺云：城門失火，殃及池魚」。遂有此說。惟不知如何？復誤「城門為鄰家」，又強以「池仲魚」入楚籍也。其實杜弼之原文，卽誤。若徴廣韵，不致羼入亡猿」事；若引淮南子，不致誤用「失火語。」意者：或傳本有亥豕之訛歟？</p>
<p>一管所窺，願質博雅。固不敢矜我之讀書，能某君之求甚解也。一笑！</p>

<p>朱胡氏隨着向這邊看了來，攙着他皺了眉道：唉！你老人家坐着罷。若是他來了，還不會到你老面前來嗎？於是他一手扯了朱胡氏，一手扯了胡嫂子，半蹲了身子，向這後門望了道：他又沒來，他……沒來……說時，那枯皺的眼皮下，又垂着兩顆淚珠。志前看着，心裏老大不忍。便向胡嫂子點了頭道？這位老太太是怎麼了？胡嫂子道：唉！這位老太太，也不知道是怎樣了，只是想他那孫姑娘。假如那女孩子不出來，我眞不願向下說。若是肯來，看這老人家一下子，那就是救命仙丹。志前道：賈先生不讓朱姑娘回來，你們不會讓你們這位老太太到小西天去看他孫姑娘嗎？胡嫂子道：唉！若是能夠到小西天去的話，我早就讓我們老太太去了。無奈那位賈老爺的脾氣，眞是古怪，他說我們老太太要去認了親戚，他就要和我們反臉。我們這窮人有多大的膽子，敢去惹他？志前道：你們這麼這樣想不通？他就是他要和你們反臉，大槪也不能殺死一個人吧？現在你們老太太去了，病就會好的，你難道情甘見死不救，也不敢得罪賈先生不成？你們只管去，我保你們無事。說着，伸了大巴掌，在胸前一拍。朱胡氏對於志前，卻是十分信仰的，聽了這話，就向老太太道：娘，那麼我們就走了去看看罷。有程老爺作主，不要緊的。（三三九）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>太后的上體旣已完全顯露了，那四個宮女——所有的太監已早在那銀浴盆抬入之後，全部退出去了——便得開始工作了；各人先分四面站開，一個站在太后的胸前，一個在背後，一個在左，一個在右。這裏所說的站，當然不是直挺挺的站立，因為太后自己已坐了下去，伊們又怎能站着給伊擦洗呢？所以伊們實在不是站，而是蹲；我卻是眞正的站着，相隔了四五步路站着，心上眞像快要看到什麼新奇的西洋鏡似的興奮。</p>
<p>那四名宮女的第一個動作便是各自取起一方繡着黃龍的白毛巾，浸入那浴盆中去，這一進下去卻不就撈起，差不多要隔了四五分鏡才同時取出來，用力絞乾，一直絞到滴水全無的程度，才松開，然後平鋪在掌上，取起那些宮內自製的玫瑰香皂來用力塗抹上去；這些動作雖很繁複，但那個宮女卻做來非常敏捷，而且舉止進退，都極齊整，很像是操演慣了的軍隊一樣。伊們把肥皂擦好之後，便一齊湊近太后身邊去，正式動起手來；一個給伊擦胸部，一個給伊擦背部，左右兩個便給伊擦洗脅下和兩臂。其時太后的神氣似乎很高興，一些不動的儘讓伊們給伊擦抹着，一面還很興奮活潑地和我隨便講論；因為伊已習慣着這樣當着人洗澡了，所以臉上竟沒有半些忸怩之態。我想我自己要是給人家強迫着這樣洗澡，那我寧可不要做皇太後的！（四三五）</p>
<h3>怪醫生</h3>
<p>— 吉安</p>
<p>怪醫生，不知何許人也，亦不詳其姓氏。因為他的行為特別，舉止怪異，於是大家就稱他為怪醫生，現在我把怪醫生最特別的地方，介紹一二則在下面：</p>
<p>怪醫生最特別的地方，便是發誓不看女人的病，假如有人不知道他的怪性，而去請教他看女人病，那定要遭他一頓臭罵，他時常說：「女人是最污穢的東西，替女人看病，是最為倒霉之事，所以我決心不替女人看病。」就是他自己的老婆病了，他也不高興自己診斷，總是去請別的醫生來醫治的，他說這樣才能把霉頭給別人去觸哩。</p>
<p>除此之外，他還有兩個特別的地方，便是腦後的一個尾巴，還至今拖着，手上的指甲，留得很長很長，人家勸他剪掉，他又要掉二句酸文道：「身體發膚，受之父母，不敢毀傷」。勸他的人也只好碰壁，至於手指上的指甲呢？留到現在，已經有四五寸的長了，和他初次碰見的人，看到了這種奇怪的行徑，眞不知道要驚異到什麼地步呢?</p>
<p>在二十世紀的現在，而還有這種怪醫生出現，眞是一件少有的事，筆之於書，以廣流傳，誰曰不宜。</p>

<h3>市招叢談</h3>
<p>— 嚴芙孫</p>
<p>號稱人口三百五，全靠着表面似乎繁榮而實際不景氣的市面支撐着，而顯豁呈露在我們的眼簾的，無非是五光十色而富有誘惑性的市招，値得人們留戀和玩味的　　裏面，自有少談奇　妙的資料，拉君權寫些出來，異日採風間俗的，得着這樣一個小參考，也足以觀乎微而覘世變了。</p>
<p>中國商人的不道德，倣效冒牌的劣根性，大槪從先天中生而俱來。冒牌中最最滑稽而帶矛盾的，莫如醬肉店的招牌，定呌陸稿薦，茶食店的招牌，定呌稻香村。於是眞陸稿薦，老稻香村，老吾老，不服人之老，你爭我奪，鬧得一天星斗。往往有開張大吉簇簇新鮮的醬肉店，而標榜着「起首老店，眞眞老陸稿薦，只此一家，並無分出」。明明是第一天新開張的新店，偏偏要大賣其老，大說鬼話。手段如此掘劣，其信譽那得不隨之而破產？唉！商人的智識和道德，如此如此！</p>
<p>三馬路兩家文魁齊　果店的大烏龜招牌上海人口中所謂「大舞台對過」者是也。現在大舞台的正門，已經另換方向，這一對左右芳鄰的元緒公，仍是昂然對峙。誰是冒牌？誰是冒牌的冒牌？這個神秘的啞謎，任誰也休想打破？這一件眞假老包的公案，當代沒有靑天，也只好諉諸一聲「天曉得」吧！</p>
<p>愛文義路派克路口，有一家小粥店，為一般勞働同志唯一的經濟食堂。店門口貼着一張已經褪色的紅紙，上面歪歪斜斜的寫着「釜弓室」三個字，原來是「當留半釜」「不諱雙弓」的取義。用諸粥店，可謂典雅渾切。所奇的，如此的清辭麗句，竟沒落到這個所在，以至湮而弗彰，我不禁為文字呌屈！</p>
<p>福州路有一家大規模的點心店，招牌呌做「近水台」望名生義，一定樓台近水。可是四馬路附近一帶，乾澡得連臭派也沒有。「台」和「水」試問如何接近？</p>
<p>近年新事業勃然而興，舊貨商店，亦居其一，老友竺君來儀，打算開一爿大規模的舊貨商店。預備破未有的新紀錄，現已着手籌備，日前，囑我代拈一個適合於舊貨的甫招。我便代題「陳陳」二字，竺君笑領道：宇面雖是陳陳，可是含義，倒也推陳出新哩。</p>
<p>上海的浴室，可算觸目皆是，命名較為雅馴的，如「洗清池」，「尚潔廬」，「華清池」之類，還不失為風趣。尤令人忍俊不禁的，　算北泥城橋的一　浴室，以「大觀園」為名的。身入其境的，人人都是，一絲不掛，袒禓裸裎，自鳥鶴鶴聚在一處，眞所謂洋洋乎大觀。而且園林所在，本是羣鳥飛翔之地，所以旣已蔚為大觀，自非在這園中漏臉不可了。但不暴利石頭記中的劉姥姥，呌伊進得園來，手揮目遂如何應接得暇呢？呵呵！</p>
<p>上海的剪刀店，十家倒有八家，呌做張小泉，這也仿佛是陸稿薦和稻香村的成例。廣西路有一家剪刀店，取名「美利堅」。式樣美觀，刀鋒銳利，質地堅固，這個命名，用諸剪刀，可謂恰當之至。而且美利堅三個字，又是一個現成的名詞。凡事只要有創造革命的精神，冒襲做效，遲早總要被淘汰的。</p>

<h3>關於知識分子</h3>
<p>— 紺弩</p>
<p>曹聚仁先生近來很看不起知識分子。記得他曾發過「百無一用是書生」之類的感慨，現在又在「五四霉菌補正」（十月八日自由談）這篇文章上說了下面這樣的話：</p>
<p>我覺得知識分子最靠不住，固然善於義憤塡膺，同時也最會賣身投靠。梁啟超推許楊度爲最有血性的靑年，而捧袁世凱上皇帝寶座的就是他；在上海做愛國運動領袖的趙欣伯，他現在在那兒做第一號漢奸；如黃遠生所自述，他自己做學生代表，自己先去投考所謂「專制」的南洋公學。知識分子的遊離意識最可怕的，把九四運動的學生代表，當作純潔的社會運動者來描寫，那是最危險的，……學生代表肯自始至終爲社會服務，眞太少了！</p>
<p>知識分子因爲所處的社會地位的關係容易變動是周知的，不消說得。必雪指出的是曹先生所說的「最不可靠」，主要的指先一義憤塡膺」，後又一賣身投靠一，不「肯自始至終為社會服務」，即變壞的意思。當然，這種話有些好處。譬如說，可以教知識分子以外的人，在幹什麼運動的時候，要靠自已底力量，不要盲目地相信知識分子，要時時監視督促，防止知識分子底退嬰，變節及自己底被騙。同時也可致知識分子自己警惕，加强决心，克服弱點。</p>
<p>然血曹先生把知識分子底變壞，好像說成宿命的，無法挽救的而且全稱的了·如果知識分子底變壞是宿命的，我們對無論什麼遝動都無需捧呈自己底熱情，更無雪克服自己底劣根性，因爲反正無法挽救，倒不如各人知趣，早點「賣身投靠一的直接了當。如果只要是知識分子就靠不住，羣衆當然應該完全看輕他們底智多星，把這種「非我族類」的傢伙早點從隊伍裏趕出去。這種解釋，如可容許，曹先生底意見够危險了。</p>
<p>首先，曹先生所說的知識分子，只是個抽象的名詞。從這名詞，除了知道是有知識的這一點，我們得不到別的無論什麼。知識是怎様的知識呢？某知識分子，他底生活環境怎樣呢？這些條件沒有了解，就斷定他靠不靠得住，未免太早計了。譬如鄭孝胥前「滿洲國」國務總理，豈不是個知識分子麼？林語堂「大師」，又豈不也多知識分子麼？他們一個在「滿洲國」做「第一號」以上的漢奸，一個住在中華民國捧「滿洲國」王底祖先所御用的漢奸「曾文正公」。依曹先生看來，當然是「靠不住」的確證了。但是「可以托六尺之孤，可以寄百里之命」，保幼主中興，鞠躬盡瘁，豈不是「一點孤忠節烈之氣」即「蠻子氣」底最高表現麼？那末，曹先生認爲「靠不住」的，却正是鄭「總理」引以自豪的「靠得住」，也就是林「大師」所崇拜的「靠得住」了。彼此所說的靠不靠得住，爲什麼這樣不同呢？我以爲該從他們底那知識底本身，尤其是他們底生活環境上去找尋答案。同時，那些從來沒有好過，也就無所謂特別「變壞」的知識分子，是大可不必放在感慨之列的。</p>
<p>其次知識分子並不是無論誰都靠不住。歷史上從羣衆運動中產生出來的偉大的領袖，知識分子就不少。不過臨難苟免賣友求榮之輩，往往被故意地做了誇大的宜傳，使有心人像蓸先生之流搖頭造歎；至於戚武不屈慷慨就義的消息，却又被封鎖，壓煞，倒無從刺激人底腦經罷了。同時，曹先生所說的從「義憤塡膺」變成「賣身投靠」，也只算看見了知識分子底一面。另一面，也正有許多知識分子從「賣身投靠」變成「義憤塡膺」。當然，要知識分子「自始至終爲社會服務」，本不容易，今天從「賣身投靠」走了來，難保明天不可從「義憤塡膺」走回去。知識分子底「游離意識」，是由他底游離生活—對工作，對社會的，寶踐的游離所養成的。</p>
<p>還有，曹先生因爲不滿意學生代表後來「賣身投靠」，就對五四運動作了過低的估價。這是錯的。五四遝動底價値應該從那運動本身所包含的社會意義上，從它在歷史上演的角色上去估計，不盡着眼在幾個學生代表底個人行爲。學生運動只是五四運動底一翼，學生代表又只是參加學生運動的一小部分人；學生代表底賣身投靠，如果不是直接出賣運動，給那運動以打擊，那運動所能發生的作用不會减少，運動本身底價値是不會减低的。何况曹先生所說的「賣身投靠」，是指以後的事；因爲以後「賣身投靠」，就推定他當時就不「純潔」，理由是欠充分。曹先生似乎很相信黃遠生，黃遠生因爲爲他自己「無主義，無理想，無節操」，所以也就無認識；他把整個運動底社會作用跟個人行動渾爲一談，用以偏概全的辦法，對學潮或革命都作了錯悮的估計，這裏無暇申說。但他豈不明明說：「吾於科舉時代，絕無作官思想，至爲留學生將畢業時，則謀生之念與所謂愛國之念交迫於中」（曹先生原文所引）麼？可見一個人縱然後來有了所謂「謀生之念」，但以前的「絕無作官思想」，也可以是千眞萬確的。當然，我不想爲「賣身投靠」的分子辯護，也不想把五四運動底意義故意誇張。如果我們從某一學生代表個人底發展過程上，能够證明他底「賣身投靠」跟五四運動有着多少因果關係，也只能說九四運動本來只是某一階段的社會運動，到了社會運動發展到更高的階段，原來參加過那種運動的子分，不能隨同社會前進，於是沒落；「賣身投靠」不過是沒落表現之一種罷了。無傷於他原先的純潔，更無傷於他參加過的運動。</p>
<p>末了，曹先生說：「我們自己應該如黃遠生那樣自己認錯，自己暴露自己的惡性梅毒，不要用好聽的詞語來掩飾」！這話是非常好的。但是只限於作爲自我淸算，作爲一個新方向底開始的塲合。如果一面「認錯」，一面又悲觀，畏縮，自我否定，那又從「惡性梅毒」變成功不可救治的憂鬱症，怯弱症了。赤裸地「暴露自己的惡性梅毒」，應該勇敢地就醫求治。否則，縱不恨病自殺，也沒有什麼可貴的地方。並且知識分子旣然善「用好聽的詞語來掩飾」，「認錯」風氣一開，安知沒有人用「認錯」這美名來掩飾自己呢？</p>
<p>總之，知識分子容易動搖是周知的。可是因此認爲會宿命地變壞，給以過分的輕蔑，却反使知識分子走頭無路，那也大可不必。</p>
<h3>星加坡港中（中）</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>麻面小夥子將手一揚，做勢要呌老頭子站起來。</p>
<p>老頭子一面亦爬翻着，一面朝四下打量，翹起嘴上的兩撮鬍子，問道：</p>
<p>「你在說天話，這裏會有甚米好東西」？</p>
<p>「扯，哪個說這里？」麻面小夥子看見老頭子走進去了，就趕忙忍笑「人家請你上岸去逛牛車水，吃南天大酒樓哪！」</p>
<p>老頭子看見那邊有警察守着，就想起這又上牠的當了，便紅着臉，駡他一句醜話。</p>
<p>麻面小夥子，好像還沒在打鬧够的光景，就對老頭子挺一挺腰幹，扣拍衣袋，喊道：</p>
<p>「怎麼？請不起麼？…這里有的是錢哪！」</p>
<p>老頭子現出苦笑的樣子，一面搔抓着頭說道；</p>
<p>「媽的，這里落得你說漂亮話，到廈門的街上，那…便試試看。」</p>
<p>他的緬甸女人雖不懂中國話，但這時已從兩人表情上明白他們打鬧玩的是什麼了，便向兩個圍着花紗縵的孩子，擠一下眼色，朝麻面小夥子那里遞一遞嘴。兩個孩子一路上都愛同麻面小夥子打打玩玩的，便立刻跑去，一前一後地抓他的衣袋子，搶他的錢。</p>
<p>剛好這時忽然有許多人都一齊擠向船欄（臨海面的一邊）仲長頸子向下面望去，麻面小夥子一面用左手按着衣袋，一面仲起右手揮着喊道「呵，呵，那里，甚米？甚米？去看呀，」才脫了身子。</p>
<p>「吝嗇的家伙！」</p>
<p>老頭子不滿意地駡了一聲，也最後擠着去看了。</p>
<p>原來是挨船邊的海面上，有三四個馬來人，身上穿着游泳用的衣衫，赤着膀子，各駕一隻很小的艇，在向頭二等艙邊站的白人搭客，仰着微笑和祈求的臉子。有一個却正從淡綠的海水里，鑽了出來，將拾着一點東西的手，高高地舉出水面，做出顯示的光景，隨即又把手往耳邊一放，對頭二等艙行了一個感謝的舉手禮。一會，頭二等舫的白人搭客，便朝海里，丟了一個白亮亮的小東西下去。馬上，兩三偭划艇的人，就丟了獎，魚也似地鑽下水去爭搶。</p>
<p>「這是在幹甚米哪？」</p>
<p>老頭子竭力睜大眼睛望着，一邊用手肘碰一碰旁邊人，這麼地問。那人拿手揩了一下額上的汗珠，一面回頭來答道。</p>
<h3>名譽老婆（七）</h3>
<p>— 江馬修作任鈞譯</p>
<p>「什麼，我是日本人呀！縱然兒子戰死了也不致於吃驚，哭泣的。那是羞人的事情。在我們日本，那些自己的可愛的兒子雖然給人家殺掉了，但却認爲那是爲國而死而想開了一切的母親是很多的。可是，我的兒子却並沒有死，還活着在。不久還有信來過。是壯健地跟俄國鬼打着仗。眞是冉也沒有比這還要更値得恭賀的事情！哈，哈，哈……」</p>
<p>接着，她就似乎故意搖盪着全身，狂笑着。</p>
<p>老婆婆還時常一個人笑嘻嘻地跑到我的母親跟前來說：</p>
<p>「太太，對不起，淸你冉把「貓皮」借給我。我想過了各種事情，又想要彈彈三弦了。」</p>
<p>所謂「貓皮」，就是指三弦。我的母親爽爽快快地把三弦借給她之後，她就把它拿到工廠那邊的工人寄宿舍裏去，坐在那一個人也不在的鋪地板的房子裏面，馬上彈了起來。自然，調子是亂七八糟的，只是信手亂彈一塲。並且還胡亂地高聲唱着歌兒。跟濟，不知道是因爲高興得按捺不住呢，還是因爲幹着這樣的事情連自己也覺得好笑，就不時張開成沒有牙齒的紅嘴巴，哈哈地笑了起來……</p>
<p>「噯呀，又開始發假瘋來了。家裏的人們雖然憐憫她，但也不免爲之皺眉。</p>
<p>「眞可憐，」母親聽見了那傳進耳朶裏來的惡魔般的音樂和哄笑，就不知不覺地獨語着：「兒子要是戰死了，那就會眞正變成瘋子吧。南無阿彌陀佛，請你保佑不要發生那樣的事情！」</p>
<p>跟最初的預料相反，旅順口並沒有那麼容易攻下。攻擊戰越來得猛烈，戰爭也就越發增加了慘劇的程度。從我們的地方上派去出征的戰士，每天每天都有陣亡的。在勝利的快柴當中歡天喜地的，恐怕就只有那些沒有從自己的親屬當中派出過一個兵土的人們。至於出征兵士的家族呢，那就在聽到實號外的聲音的時候，在把報紙打開來的時候，在談着戰爭的風說的時候，心胸都給不安的恐怖騒擾着。</p>
<p>燒飯老婆婆的兒子還是平平安安地打着仗。不但是這樣，而且最近還因爲有功，被昇爲上等兵。老婆婆十分得意。</p>
<p>「怎麼一回事！」她皺着鼻子在笑：「還是我的兒子了不起！我在神佛跟前祈早過，叨神佛的福，兒子沒有死，還昇了上等兵，這眞是幹得不錯呀。也許他已經不會死，要當大將帶着閃亮的金鷄動章回來哩。萬歲萬歲！」</p>
<h3>古城</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>又搬了家。</p>
<p>眞的是住到古老的城墻底下來了，只要一拐灣，便能在那灰灰的胡同裏望見那灰灰的城墻，一陣風過時，便拖起一大片烟霧般的把眼前遮得像是隔了多少層紗縵。</p>
<p>曾在別處看到過旅行到這裏來的遊客，在他們的照片堆裏，總不會呌人失望地能找到一兩張關於這古城的城樓的留影，那麼龐大，那麼雄壯，呌人不能不爲東方式的建築窒息了驚詫的嘆服，多少人是爲這垜古城構盡起美的神幻的夢來了。</p>
<p>然而，眼前擺着的這一個，是怎樣地顯着中世紀的衰敗啊！</p>
<p>零落，破亂，蠢呆……</p>
<p>爲了傾圯，大半城門畔的階層旁都掛了「禁止攀登」的牌子，或者是在防止遊人危險之外還有什麼深意吧？但人總還能我到一些歷年來甲人的足跡來踏處的路徑而偷跑了上去，由那裏望得見北平城裏的壯觀！—紅墙黃瓦，以及一些新建榮中的灰墙綠瓦，遠遠的是埋在雲霧中的山頭，可惜的是這裏並沒有那麼多的浩浩蕩蕩的河流，連那城脚邊的一條都細得像根絲帶，遇到熱天苦早時，一陣陣的惡奧倒會隨風應開了的，這會呌來自水鄉的人狠狠地咒駡了。來倒城頭上的人除了巡査和淘氣的遊人外，那就是要把性命由這裏扔下去的堅城者，這在人們耳中都成了並不新鮮的新聞了。</p>
<p>柏油馬路上是禁止大車通行的，於是大半都得穿小胡同或者繞了城根走，重戰的牲口的路子和車輪深深地踩在厚厚的土裏，「人是由土裏長大的」這句話也許並不錯呢。駱駝隊也時常從這兒走過，古城，駝鈴，不又給在夢幻中呼吸的人們以一些憧憬麼？</p>
<p>似乎是，城棖底下是很少見高門大戶的，哪個紳土小姐是情願在還兒吃灰的呵！這裏、只是破落尸或壓根兒就沒抬頭過的小房兒聚集在一起，孩子們成年地蹲在地上堆土玩，在城牆上畫一點小人兒小馬，採那打磚縫裏伸出頭來的野花，在秋天，打一些野生的酸棗。孩子們有淚有笑，有說有駡地長大起來。</p>
<p>在城門脚下，兩旁總有幾方黃土新磚的痕跡，信封上的郵票似的貼在那裏。那是四年前事變起時的一度防禦工作，挖好壕溝，準備在那裏架起高射砲。</p>
<p>走出城，少不了小市集似的地攤和擔販，舍力們站在那兒吃點灌腸喝點熱湯。火車過路的柵攔依着時開關了再放，來去的人們車輛暫時歇住脚，看着那長長的火取和那車窗裏透出來的一張張風塵險。</p>
<p>住在這城牆脚下，每犬火車過時的畏吼要算是最動人的音樂了，牠勾起了什麼，又帶走了什麼。</p>
<h3>回憶裏的陽光</h3>
<p>— 吳讓三</p>
<p>這個時候我住在上海。</p>
<p>並不是一個怎麼好的地方。而且天氣不好，我底房屋又很壞。天空是混沌的靑鉛色，模糊的雲塊揉合成一些醜陋的相貌，總是那麼曖昧，浮腫，一層一層的灰色加上去，就越過越變成冷靜的陰險。</p>
<p>偶然地，一年中有幾天，也會從窗角裏漏下一筒無力的陽光，斜斜地挿在壁上或塗了蟲膠片的黃色的棹子上，這便是我底最大的慰安。假使不是這樣，一個人一年中沒有過一次陽光，我想我會活不下去的。</p>
<p>我跳起來，用我底嘴唇去吻牠。她像我已經失去了一切，而這是我底惟一的最後的所有物。我放下了一切別的事情。睡在掉子上，或靠在牆壁上，閉着眼睛，把我底臉正對着牠，儘量從呼吸裏把牠抽進去。…用一面鏡子做着老玩法。細心地，忍耐地，把陽光帶到房間所有的角落裏，戚到我眞地燒掉過什麼東西的滿足。有時用一盆水。有時用手掌擋住牠，而自己躱在手掌下面。……總之。用各種方法得到我底快樂。……</p>
<p>我從前是有過使用不盡的陽光的。沒有住過大學，但是把那些割裂的，斷續的，小學和中學的生活縫補起來，也可以凑成六七個學年。——璀燦的陽光無休止地照耀着我的那些日子。</p>
<p>相反地，我那時並不曾愛惜牠過，也不知道牠對於我會有什麼興趣。在野外，在操塲裏，在走廊上，我隨意拾起牠，又隨意拋掉牠。</p>
<p>現在，我對於牠底使用眞是十分吝惜的了！有時向牠哭然睜開眼睛，牠就刺痛我，流下眼涙來，在這閉上眼睛的當見我想起了從前不知道珍惜牠的事。</p>
<p>我並不是用陽光來象徵靑春或別的什麼，那沒有多大意思。譬如靑春，我就以爲可以借眞正的藝術力量，使牠水不消滅，而且更加旺盛地存在着的。</p>
<p>我不過喜歡，就使牠刺痛我，流下眼淚，閉起眼睛來，那種眞的快樂。</p>
<p>— 黃士英作</p>
<p>天父啊：願你保佑遭兩個子女平安地進了天國吧！</p>

<p>全國運動大會、昨爲第五日、男女田徑賽中、男子撑竿跳高、上海符保盧、以三公尺九士之特殊成績、打破自已保持之全國紀錄、其次五名、成績俱極優越、爲大會五日來、最佳之收獲、女子擲標槍河南原恒瑞亦破全國紀錄、但不如理想之佳、男女田徑三錦標、已穩歸上海毫無問題、男女田徑、今日結束、明日全能及游泳開始、球類比賽、形勢日緊、大都已到達半複賽、將屆短兵相見之時期矣、</p>
<h3>田徑最豐滿收穫　符保盧得意傑作　三公尺九十破全國　亞軍王禾三公尺八五　亦平等保盧全國紀錄</h3>
<p>大會開幕以來、各項田徑賽成繢、無一項令人分滿意者、惟有昨日之撑竿跳、堪稱大會之最收獲、冠軍仍爲第四五兩屆之冠軍符保盧保持、成續達三公尺九十、接近遠東、而第二之王禾亦達三公尺八五、平等全國、第三四五六名之成績、亦極優秀、均出吾人意料之外、茲將當時决賽情形誌下、</p>
<p>人材鼎盛　出人意料</p>
<p>昨日下竿一時開賽、至六時始畢、計跳過三公尺者、達二十人、旣升至三公尺三十、跳過者共有十人、爲粵之吳敬順馬偲光、滬之王禾·符保盧·魏志平、贛之黃伯剛、遼之張禹昌、馬華之許然泮、陳易經、閩之蔡子顯等十人、既升至三公尺四五、張·黃·陳蔡·四人均未過、其餘諸子均跳過、再升至三公尺五五、符保盧·王禾·馬德光·黃伯剛、均跳過、但魏志平與吳敬順未能跳過、如斯魏吳二人再跳以决五六、結果魏勝而獲第五、吳得第六、</p>
<p>符王競爭　表演精彩</p>
<p>然後再升至三公尺七五、王禾一躍而過、符保盧還以顏色、亦一躍而過、而馬德光與黃伯剛則未過、如斯而二人屢升屢降、以决名次、結果黃敗於馬、而得第四、馬則以同樣之成績而列第三、按黃伯剛、即黃毅」也、上届大會曾獲撑竿跳第四、再升至三公尺八五、符保盧一躍而過、王禾兩躍亦過、全塲掌聲沸騰、知全國紀錄之必破也、再升至三公尺九十、王禾先跳未過、符跳亦不能過、繼之干禾兩跳不過、遂告失格、而符於第二、亦因手觸竿過、未能跳過、此時符之大敵雖去、但本人亦只餘一次機會、此時運動老將馮健維在塲、爲符保盧施行按摩、符於金塲發熱後、精神頓然一振、三公尺九十、輕輕跳過、</p>
<p>撑竿跳第一符保盧　（葉長烈攝）</p>
<p>試破遠東　失之毫厘</p>
<p>其後、裁判員將橫竿之高度、升至四公尺零一、按遠東紀錄爲四公尺正、十屆遠東會之成績、爲三公尺九零五、如果符君能跳過四公尺零一、則遠東紀錄破矣、符於試跳四公尺零一時、三次均能跳過、惜均因手與橫太絲亳之抵觸、碰洛橫木、致此宿願未償、</p>
<p>平均成績　美滿可觀</p>
<p>符君昨日之勝王禾、一則得利於戰略、賽前符君聲明不出塲、並自謂二個月來未曾練習、巧騙王禾、王自以爲得意、未料符有此成績、致因輕敵而敗、全部成績、列之如下、</p>
<p>（一）符保盧（上海）三公尺九〇（全國新）</p>
<p>（二）王禾（上海）三公尺八五（平全國）</p>

<h3>今日决賽預測　萬米大有可觀　全國好手重算舊賬　山西四將値得注意</h3>
<p>今日之一萬公尺决賽、屆時定有一番盛况也、出塲者、山西有谷得勝、陳樹森、李登桂、王山東有鈕鴻銓、李輝、上海有王正林、張良有金康、何寳山、依過去之成績論、山西四跑將、有包辦前四名希望、上海之王正林、當可入預、首名之成績、當在三十三四分左右、冠軍以谷得勝之呼聲最高、回憶二年以前、第五屆大會在南京舉行、萬公尺决賽、因發生談判問題、谷得勝與金件康遂揚名天下、本屆大會、山西人馬齊整、而江蘇之金仲康君、亦依然健在、參加之員、亦多曾出席前屆者、舊賬重算、頗耐人尋也、</p>
<p>女二百李錢有望</p>
<p>今日之女子二百公尺决賽、出席者、有李森、錢行素·焦玉蓮·吳心菊·唐其貞·鄧銀嬌·陳鏗·許梅英·萬玉蓮·陳鏗等九人、就實力論、李森最有希望、錢行素·鄧銀嬌次之、陳鑑·焦玉蓮又次之、成績當在二十八秒左右、恐不易打破全國紀錄、又河南之焦玉蓮小姐、本保持全國紀錄、此次竟一蹶不振、於百公尺中、僅居第五位、焦於二百公尺中、過去在華北會中、亦甚佳、自來滬就讀東亞體等、成績每况愈下、望今後勉之、</p>
<p>三級跳王士林病</p>
<p>北平有王士林、多病、跳高·跳遠·均未能參加、上海之張嘉　、對於此項、成績較爲可靠、實力近十四公尺、在滬之萬國運動會中、一跳而得十三公尺九十、南京之楊道貴、在靑島之暑訓會、成績十四公尺十五、而王森在平春運之成績、爲十四公尺十八、王若今日出塲、尚可得一席地位、否則三級跳爲楊張之爭霜舞台也、</p>
<p>四百米人人言倦</p>
<p>男子四百公尺决賽、會前之預測、必有全國紀錄產生、因董叔昭、戴淑國、傅金城三人成績、均極可觀、代記者昨遇參加四百公尺諸選手、詢其意見、都言疲乏不堪、難有良好之成績、如董叔昭昨日之出塲、實在勉强、因前日在八百公尺中與李世銘之競爭、用力甚多、而李於四百公尺、亦告棄權、又如傳金城、曾參加一百·二百·四百公尺等之决·複·次·預賽、凡十次之多、而戴淑國亦曾參二百、四百公尺之决·次·複·預賽等、以各選手之疲勞程度觀之、欲打破全國紀錄、恐難如上靑天、</p>
<p>女壘球有新紀錄</p>
<p>女子壘球擲遠全國紀錄、必將粉碎、大會紀錄兼全國紀錄之四十五公尺三五、前六名必盡所超出、上海梁韻森之成績、達五十一公尺餘、其他如河南之原恒瑞、廣東之顏秀容、上海之陳榮棠、成績均在四十五公尺以上、</p>
<p>女接力滬無問題</p>
<p>女子接力賽跑、上海隊以李森、錢行素、焦玉蓮、彭愛浦、西人出塲、實力不可當、獲得冠軍、毫無問題、第二爲馬來隊、第三爲廣東隊、比平、靑島、福建、江蘇、將奪取第四五六名、</p>
<p>記者證章通用各塲</p>
<p>據全運會宣傳組發表、本屆大會、承本市及各地新聞記者之援助、使大會在宣傳方面諸多方便、實深感荷、惟招待或有欠週之處、還希多多原諒、至各地報館特派記者到會採新聞者、對大會一切、或以人地生疏、發生困難、可隨時向宣傳組接洽、當竭誠予以便利、大會記者證章、原定僅適用於田徑塲者、近日起爲便利記者採訪起見、已可通行各塲矣、</p>

<h3>川隊抗議川平足球賽疑點　經解釋後抗議退回　延長時間其中並無休息　國術紀錄今晨查明簽覆</h3>
<p>昨晨平川足球賽、北平以四比三勝四川、形勢甚爲平均而緊張、終局時、爲二與二之比、延長三十分鐘、平隊連中二球、四川僅奪回一隻、結果北平遂以四與三淘汰四川、迨比賽完畢、川隊總領隊及教練等、以裁判員呂菖馥所計之延長時間三十分鐘中、僅踢二十七分鐘、尚少三分鐘、否則川隊大有造成平手機會、特向審料委員會提出抗議、昨晚審判委員會召集曾議於體育館、討論四川隊之抗議、到審判委員十一人、列席者當時足球裁判呂菖馥、巡邊員二人、及四川總領隊劉勉旃、關於川隊之點、經裁判員解釋之後、川隊劉君、並無異議、後王正廷提議張伯苓附議、以川隊之抗議、實則並非抗議、全在請求大會解釋、精神可佩、提議將抗議書及保證金退還川隊、一塲抗議、遂此和平了結、其經過之情形如左、</p>
<p>川隊抗議內容　四川總領隊抗議書、內分足球及國術射箭二種、其中又各分二點、關於足球者（一）川隊謂在比賽將完畢、比數爲二對二、川隊正在進攻時、裁判員突有一次嗚笛停賽、致使川隊失却一得勝機會、（二）在延長時間三十分鐘中、僅踢二十七分鐘、比數雖爲四比三、然平隊已精疲力竭、川隊大有造成平手機會、關於國術者、謂裁判員記錄、有所錯誤、請求解釋、</p>
<p>足球裁判解釋　會議時、先由川領隊陳述後、主席陳伯苓、請足球裁判呂菖馥答復、呂君之解釋如下、（一）關於無故鳴笛停賽、川隊慨未指明何一次、而在將完畢時、即一分鏡內、亦有吹笛數次者、故此點無從答覆以事實度之、裁判决不致於無故胡亂嗚笛、（二）延長時間中少踢三分鐘事、呂之解釋如下、照球規延長時間一十分鐘中、十五分鐘互門繼續比賽、但其中並無休息、川球員於—五分鐘時、曾出綫外稍息、故川隊之計時、大約將此休息時間扣去之誤、關於國術部份、通過由主席張伯苓今晨査閱紀錄、即可答覆、毫無問題、</p>
<p>結果退回抗議　經此解釋後、川隊劉君起謂、川隊參加大會、本非爲勝負而來、志在觀摩、今之抗議、不過欲使大會注意及解釋比賽時發生之疑點、故並不堅持、王正廷委員乃起稱、據劉君前後所言、全爲擁護大會、並非抗議、今旣解釋明白、提議將保證金退還、張伯苓附議、速同抗議書一併退回、滿意而散、</p>
<p>四川兩抗議書　川總領隊、因昨（十四）日上午、該省足球隊與北平市足球隊比賽、延長時間尚爲滿足、裁判員即宣布結果、認為昨日兩度向大會審判委員會提送抗議書、請求公决、茲將該單位兩抗議書誌後、</p>
<p>（一）敬啟者、本日（十四日）午前化時、敝隊足球隊與北平足球隊比賽結果、據大會報告、爲四比三、北平勝、敝隊對於本塲球賽、有兩點懷疑之處、特錄陳於左、（一）下半時成二對二時、敝隊傳球至北平隊區城時、該隊內部、極爲空虛、於敝隊極爲有利、並無犯規等情、裁判忽嗚笛停止、而給與北平隊良好之機會、待援兵大至時、裁判乃宣布繼續進行、此與敝隊以莫大之影響應請大會答復、（二）下半時終塲時、結果爲二比二、依規定延長肝分鐘、在延長時間內、北平隊二球、敝隊進一球、成四比三之形勢、在延長時間內之下半時、僅十二分鐘時、敝隊正在北平區域內努力角逐、極佔優勢、血裁判又鳴笛宣布結束、據敝隊總領隊劉愼旃、在西同司令台下足球指導鄧德光在東司令台大門入口休息處、管理昌黃鍚嘏在看台上、自記時問、均稱僅十二分鐘、當時敝隊劉愼旃總領隊、鄧德光指導、當面向栽判員提出口頭抗議、據裁判員稱、可逕向大會報告、茲特將上述兩理由、依競賽規程第廿一章規定、繳納保證金十元、於一小時內、向大會提出抗議、敬請公决、此致審判委員會、</p>
<p>（二）敬啟者、敝隊射箭選手劉用熙、於本日午前、一時參加比賽射遠、經决賽結果、劉用熙成績爲一〇五·〇五公尺、裁判員紀錄爲第六名、後因河南領隊提議、某選手於預賽時、成績爲一〇五·四七公尺、但决賽時、相差劉用熙成績有十餘公尺之多、（劉用熙曾有一○八·三之紀錄）河南領隊捉出不依决賽成績、而以預賽成績爲成績、故將某選手列爲第六名、而將敝隊劉用熙取銷、當時敝隊選手劉用熙即向裁判員張唯中先生提出口頭抗議、又經張唯中先生轉向國衛裁判長褚民誼先生報告、褚裁判長答復不甚圓滿、令人失望、茲將用書而　出抗議、敬請大會决决、此致審判委員會、</p>

<h3>港十九比零大破皖城　延長時間北平四比三倖勝四川</h3>
<p>昨日有二塲足球次賽、上午九時、北平對四川、實力平均、鏖戰劇烈、結果造成對二之平局、延長三十分鐘後、北平始以四與三之比、僥倖獲勝、下午四時、香港與安徽作戰、港隊由球王李惠堂率領三軍、實力至强、竟以千九對零大敗皖軍、　本屆大會足球賽勝利記錄、</p>
<h3>北平戰勝四川　延長時間始勝一球</h3>
<p>昨晨九時、北平與四川足球賽、雙方實力相捋、短兵肉搏、異常激烈、上半時川隊遇逆風、球隨風轉、異常吃力、鏖戰良久、未分勝負、至半小時後、平軍攻勢漸懈、川中堅石昭德趁勢前進、傳球與右鋒周泰臨、內衛回救不及、砰然一脚、球遂入網、平軍全綫反攻、混戰久之、並無所獲、上半時四川以一球得勝、</p>
<p>下半時易地再戰、川軍佔上風、勢益順利、平隊小心翼翼、防守嚴密、肉搏約二十分鐘、均無所獲、未幾平右鋒帶球進犯、殺過後衛、傳球至門前中心、中鋒連且勳趕上一脚、造成一比一、平分春色、旋川隊又攻陷一球、最后數分鐘、平中堅拚命偷渡敵寨、獲得寶貴之一分、又造成二對二平衡、下半時忽告終了、</p>
<p>裁判員乃宣吿戰事延長三十分鐘、接觸僅數分鐘時間、川軍連失二球、十五分鐘再易陣地、川軍努力反攻、在最后五分鐘內、始由右鋒周泰臨射入一球、銀笛聲中、戰局告終、總分四比三、勝利屬於北平、</p>

<h3>香港橫掃安徽　十九對零創新紀錄</h3>
<p>昨日下午四時、香港戰安徽、香港在本屆足球隊中、實力最爲雄厚、前鋒有球王李惠堂指揮作戰、左右翼鄭季良曹桂成衝鋒陷陣、包家平把守鋼門、進可以攻、退可以守、以最佳陣綫、應付向無經騐之安徽隊、終以十九比零、開本屆大會勝球之紀錄、港軍以極輕鬆之戰法、隨便踢來、彌不佳妙、球王李惠堂之脚頭、射門之雄姿、確能號召觀衆、獨立攻獲八球、亦殊難能可貴、兩軍戰况如下、</p>
<p>球王神威　開球後、球王領軍取攻、皖方、皖方實力懸殊、絕難抵抗、港隊三鋒命射、觸柱渦門不入者、不下四五次之　多、十分鐘後、球王發球連珠砲發、迭陷兩城、卓石金揭竿起義、繼續建功、鄭季良邊防發動、亦打進一只、混戰俄頃、球王又顯神技、玩皖門於掌上、迭在後衛界內輕取兩球、沈廷堃目迎入網、徒喚奈何、未幾、黎兆榮偷渡皖軍禁地、又獲一球、港隊戰來絕不費力、即以七比零佔先、其後雖得一十二碼罰球、球王輕僥槍頭、使沈廷堃得以從容接住、上半時歡歡喜喜、鳴金收軍、</p>
<p>又是一打　休息過後、短兵接戰、黎兆榮再施下馬威、李國威雖職司前衛、亦自遠送人一球、鄭季良繼立大功、球十脾肉復生、亦射入一球、未幾黎兆榮黃美順相繼射門、又告中的、球王興到、再打一只、鄭季良由取一球後、球王又陷一城、卓石金黃美順繼之、勝球之速、可稱時無兩、詎完塲五分錦許、球王冉取一只、下半塲十二比零、總結果十九比零、港隊大勝、陣勢如下、</p>

<h3>足球錦標形勢</h3>
<p>男子網球</p>
<h3>男子雙打升入複賽週　上海馬華爪哇四川得複賽　昨滬勝粵三比二非常吃力</h3>
<p>男子網球雙打昨日舉行半複賽、照章以五盤三賽定勝負、爪哇馬來上海等好手均出席、而重要節目則在上海與廣東之戰、初觀衆集中於許承基弟兄對河北之比賽、因係一面倒、與趣不多、旋均　集於滬粵之賽、滬由林邱出塲、固最强之雙打組合、殊不知廣東之徐潤培與黎廣駿、合作佳妙、攔網高壓、無一不精、予林邱以重大之威脅、劇戰五盤、方决勝負、表演精彩異常、實屬少見、四組結果、上海爪哇四川馬華得複賽權、成績如下、</p>
<p>滬粵劇戰經過　出手不利</p>
<p>林邱手脚生疏、開首不利、以二比四局落後、見勢不佳、急起直追、林發球得勝、黎　駿則以發球局、三次雙誤敬客、遂成四比四平手、但以後林邱在可勝之局面下、每至緊要關頭、一再自誤、下局曾連勝三記、而後反連輸五記、而失是局、可勝而敗、局勢大變、徐黎繼得發球局、以六比四先聲奪人、</p>
<p>精彩表演</p>
<p>第二盤林邱發憤　擊、更以邱爲海已能漸入　可狀態、於是雙管齊下、聲勢汹汹、黎廣駿徐潤堷奔跑還擊、不甘示　、即爭乙見熱烈，表演亦愈見精彩、博得掌聲不絕、二比二、三比三林邱所致作精神、全力對付、連下二局、以五比三領專、雙方在技術與智力上爭奪門勝、神妙非凡、林又奮得發球局、遂以六比三勝、</p>
<p>連得兩盤</p>
<p>下盤之競爭、雙方仍維持强力之攻擊興趣仍十分濃厚、林邱合作純熟、網前工作、巧妙無比、但對手不憚奔跑、旁人以爲無可奈何之球、亦能還過網去、林邱不稍放鬆、左右夾攻、速得四局、往後數局中、粵雖奪得二局、卒以二比六再敗、上海二比一導前、</p>
<p>秋色平分</p>
<p>休息　戰、廣東連取二局、頗有蒸蒸日上之勢、林邱有所不甘、立即還敬二局、當第四局上、邱飛海在底角外還擊一球、巧中立於網柱邊之拾球童子頭上、裁判員即判滬負一記、林邱咸認爲此球如過去、當係好球、同時廣東黎廣駿立即聲辯、以爲此球即使過網、亦屬出界球、裁判員一時無從判决、後審視球綫、仍判好球、三三之後、林邱在萎靡不振中、又以三比六失敗、勝負遂不得不第五盤中解决、</p>
<p>滬粵網球單打賽右林寶華左徐潤培</p>
<p>最後勝利</p>
<p>决賽開始、黎徐陣容慌亂、每以推讓自誤、林邱志在必勝、豈肯放鬆一步、　時間連陛三級、遙佔上風、此後在無精打彩中、自四比一、四比二、而五比二、黎徐圖最後掙扎、觀衆忽亦精神一振、但狂瀾既倒、挽回芝術、六比三歸上海最後勝利、</p>
<p>四川淘汰南京</p>
<p>四川南京之戰、缺少生氣、良以南京馬少伯梁德光、靜如處女、殺氣全無、鎭靜工夫、高人一等、王文正錢耀彬竟不易取勝、第三盤卒被南京奪得、第四盤各以軟球攻擊、頗有難解難分之勢、形勢至爲平均、結果四川以三比一淘汰南京、</p>
<p>爪哇探之囊中</p>
<p>爪哇許承基許承位、對河北鄭伯谷李定顧、實力懸殊、許氏昆仲不事苛求、輕描淡寫、六比二旗開得勝、第二盤頗有激烈競爭、許先得三局、鄭李拚命還攻、成四比三、而五比四、許再以六比四勝、第三盤形勢日非、鄭李僅得一局耳、直落三、爪哇淘汰河北、</p>
<p>馬華實力强勁</p>
<p>北平雜孝超羅孝建昆仲之雙打、前曾自稱有得全運錦標之希望、其言尚屬少年氣盛、但觀昨日表演、確實可觀、惜遇馬畢林望蘇阮國英、在强權壓迫之下、生路全無、連負三盤、且於每盤中、祗各得一局林阮雙打、配合緊湊、爲上海之犬敵、下週複賽、將狹路相逢、一塲惡戰、不知鹿死誰手也、</p>
<p>男子雙打形勢</p>
<h3>男子單打比賽　今日結束次賽　昨賽四塲今日仍有四塲</h3>
<p>男子網球、已入緊張局面、單打第三週、昨賽四塲、今日將全部結束、己得半複賽權者、爲滬林寶華·邱飛海·及川王文正·錢耀彬、將與今日之優勝者、於明日競奪複賽權、網球塲畔、行將人山人海、擁擠不堪、</p>
<p>昨日單打四塲、於下午一時開始、各組比賽、均極精彩、故觀衆頗多、林邱老將威風、不改當年、徐黎新進好手、亦屬不凡、王文正球藝日進、上駟之村、其正手抽球、雷霆千鈞、雖許基當之、亦當失色、其餘諸子、均係第二流角色、各具相當技能、加以時日、定可造就、昨賽結果、滬川全勝、比數如左、</p>
<p>林寳華</p>
<p>林徐之戰、首先登塲、徐潤培雖抱必敗之心、但抵抗到　、其志可嘉、林寳華成竹在胸、不慌不忙、聞賽之初、林寶華光芒萬丈、即予小徐以迎頭痛擊、連勝五局、小徐拚命反攻、扳回二局、但曇花一現、下局仍爲林得、遂以六比二結束第一盤、第二盤起、林挾戰勝餘威、風頭十足、靳球攔網、百無一失、小徐竭力周旋、無濟大事、林以三比〇局、高居上風、徐乃改變戰略、上網攔殺、果然馬到成功、奪得一局、但得不償失、林聲東擊西、時遠時近、徐疲於奔命、不得不甘拜下風、結果六比一林得勝、</p>
<p>許承基開球姿勢　（國際及王開攝）</p>
<p>邱飛海</p>
<p>邱飛海人老珠黃、球技日退、但久　沙塲、經騐老到、黎廣駿廣東健將、抽殺俱佳、異火　太大、不能忍耐、宣告開戰　、黎因勁敵當前、慌張　常、出球無力、管束無方、邱全力進攻、毫不放鬆、底綫長抽、深入兩角、一路順風、連勝六局、再戰聲起、邱已力竭、黎則續漸鎭定、立意報仇、因之形勢平均、競爭極烈、各一各二、而至各二、數度平手、是時黎廣駿亦現疲憊、兩人牽絲扳藤、你來我往、打得精神毫無、四比二、五比四、昨黎兩次領前、卒因經騐不足、　光火冒、自殺野球、不一而足、於是邱加上三局、以七比五底定大局、</p>
<p>王文正</p>
<p>王文正藝高意驕、一再輕敵、昨戰南京馬少伯、幾乎失利、亦患是病、接觸後、馬奮勇進取、馬到成功、以二比〇局高佔侵勢、入後五頻施掃射、反敗爲勝、以六二比得第一盤、王本性難栘、病復發、志高氣昂、目空一切、以爲對方技術平平、慨足介意、不料金陵之馬、雄健非常、連勝四局、大有直搗黃龍之勢、四座觀衆、相顧愕然、文正亦大驚失色、方知敵勢非輕、不可小視、急忙留心應戰、果然棋高一着、屢次建功、一瀉千里、連取六局、遂以六比四再勝、</p>
<p>獲女網球雙打複賽權之魏氏姊妹　（葉長烈攝）</p>
<p>錢耀彬</p>
<p>蜀中無大將、廖化作先鋒、上届全運、林寶華登臺拜將、正印先鋒錢耀彬、今次大會、王文正客串掛印、先鋒官一仍其舊、由錢先鋒闊別二年、技能如昔、未見進步、南京李不祖、首都名將、頗具相當實力、兩人相較、半斤八兩、昨日最後勝利、卒婦小錢者、實體力之分耳、第一盤李進攻甚力、以六比四勝、小錢不甘屈服、第二盤中、奮勇反抗、左右抽壓、還他顏色、照樣以六對四之比數奉還、第三盤爲生死之爭、戰情自更劇烈、但李於首二盤中、用力渦甚、漸盛體力不支、錢則雄風依舊、着着進取、李僅奪得一局、以六比一慘遭淘汰、</p>

<h3>女雙打達複賽　上海馬華得複賽權</h3>
<p>女子網球雙打、昨日半複賽兩塲、上海對廣東之戰、於上午化時接觸、馬華與南京之賽、於下午三時舉行、結果滬馬勝利全收、奪得複賽資格、將於明日分別與山西四川競爭决賽權、上海魏氏姊妹花、資格老練、聯絡純熟、廣東姑娘、遠非其敵、馬華僑胞、陸小姐矮而且胖、行動緩慢、謝小姐嬌小玲瓏、姿態活潑、兩人球藝、以穩健取勝、南京黃山農夫、截髮短裝、大有男子風度、金琳姑娘、姿容美麗、裝飾入時、兩人技能、亦頗可觀、與陸謝相較、有過之無不及、昨遭淘汰、非戰之罪也、各糾成續列後、</p>
<p>滬粵之爭</p>
<p>於上午九時宣告告開始、上海魏氏姊妹先聲奪人、取得二局、廣東楊阮、投桃報李·還他顏色、造成各二和局、入後二魏芒鋒畢露、一氣加上四局、以六比四先勝一盤、第二盤起、二魏雄風依然、連得二局、楊阮竭力反攻、扳回一局、機又造成三三局面、二魏再接再厲、　陞三級、遂以六比三凱旋而盡、</p>
<p>京馬之戰</p>
<p>於午後三時開始、雙方實力平均、競爭殊烈、馬華小姐鑒於單打之慘遭淘汰、失志報復、南京　娘、亦非善者、竭力防禦、乘機進攻、惟馬華隊沉着應戰、有志竟成、先以六比四　得第一盤黃金失利、再戰聲中、南京組攻守得法、曾以五比三局佔絕對優勢、大有收子回頭之概、惜乎時不我再冷馬獨出、陸謝屢屢得手、以七比五前勝第二盤</p>

<h3>上海淘汰河北　十八日與廣東奪標　昨以九對二勝河北</h3>
<p>上海棒球隊昨以九對二勝河北於複賽（乙）中、得决賽權、定於十八日與上屆錦標廣東爭奪錦標、將來兩雄逐鹿、大有可觀、昨日上海投手甘鍼、大顯身手、九局之中、僅予人二次安打、寶非易事、接手何憲成、資格老到、思想周密、會同全體伴侶、一致合作、達到勝利目的、河北投手張敏慧接手龔慶宗技　、不及上海遠甚、時顯軟弱之點、而內壘外翼、應呼裕如、故雖在惡劣環境之下、亦不致鑄成大錯、司球裁判員張國動、司壘裁判陳福田、記錄員黎寶駿、</p>
<p>戰雲乍開上海佔勢</p>
<p>河北上塲先攻、上海以逸待勞、鮑女沛第一中伏、陳炳籌繼之、安步至一壘、暗襲二壘、受傷出、替以鮑文沛、値張敏慧忽出二壘打、鮑於掌聲　鳴之中、　奔返壘、不負重大使命、但張氏因後來者之不力、空抱壯志、上海反守爲攻、周駿安打占一壘、廣東投手野投、乃進據一壘、梁澄松加一安打、周氏凱旋而返、曾瑞祺擊出、河北陣勢突亂、梁澄松輕騎疾歸、第一局上海乃以二對一佔勢、第二局河北登塲三人、無一生還、上海大形活動、安　生首出二壘打、方關紹隨同進展、何憲成輕輕一撥、安樂生還壘、周駿粱澄松相率加入戰團、舉目一望、二壘盡是上海戰士、曾瑞祺一記、周駿即返第二局上海二分、河北零分、</p>
<p>將士奮鬥天地變色</p>
<p>第三局平安過去、第四局大戰爆烈、上海乘河北失勢之後、振臂奮進、何憲成首獲一分、五分鐘內、上海戰士、又滿占三壘、曾瑞康二壘打、周駿粱澄松先後返巢、粱扶初人稱福將、一球飛出、安送曾氏歸壘、是局上海得四分、勝利已在掌中、第五局方關紹再秦奇功、其還壘也、出於河北投手野投之過、第六局雙方僅有小接觸、無得失利害關係、第七局河北全隊努力進攻、龑慶宗一再奮鬥、有志竟成、獲得一分、來者亦稱不弱、個個有爲、三角式壘上、均見河北踪跡、不料連連中伏、全功書棄、是局河北一分、上海零、第八第九兩局、又入靜悶狀態之中、河北旣無所得、上海亦放棄第九局、比賽結果、上海九對二勝河北、</p>

<p>張慕霞創立不世功</p>
<p>山東隊之勝、得力於投手張慕霞居多、　第二第三兩局予對方四記安打外、其餘五局、則會同內壘外翼、採用封鎖策略、敵人爲之瞠目、寸步難進、攻打方面在第一第五兩局之中、各擊一本壘　、創立不世之功、奠定乾坤、餘若王鳳傑金志範徐駿等、均壇於擊打、全隊合作工作、頗見純熟、錦標前途雅有希望、</p>
<p>卓金意　壘第一人</p>
<p>實東成績、尙屬可觀、內外二綫、亦能應呼一致、惜乎投手技藝平庸、種下不少禍根、尤不幸者、第一局中全隊錯誤百出、即遭莫大損失、第五局中、對方攻者巳三去其一一、投手稍一大意、又受重大打擊、打球技術、能者不多、卓金意允稱此中好手、首得二壘打、爲廣東隊歸壘第一人、尚有梁適宜於第三局中、亦得一安打、同時亦獲得一分、此外諸人、皆相率空手而歸、</p>
<p>七局戰况形勢緊張</p>
<p>山東上塲桃戰、王鳳傑首出高球、廣東游擊漏接、進展一壘、繼而暗襲一壘、金志範出三壘打、王即歸壘廣東錯誤百出金亦乘虛而歸、徐駿高球、被接出塲、張慕霞隨擊一本壘打、全塲爲之大振、隨後二人均無成績、第一局山東得三分、廣東反攻、先後失收、彼時曾因小小號目問題、引起糾紛然不久解决、比賽照常進行、第二局廣東卓金意二壘打、聲勢一振、繼而倫龔三壘、再後乘投手野球歸壘、是局山東零、廣東一、第三局廣東又得一分、山東仍毫無所得、雙方比數、二對三、廣東頗有後來居上之勢、第四局各無進展、第五局山東張慕霞本壘打、一時歸者四人、勝局由是奠定、此後二局、彼此堅壁淸野、咸無發展餘地結果七對二山東勝、山東投手張慕霞、接手金志範、廣東投手梁適宜、接手梁莊見、</p>

<p>（一）馬來勝南京</p>
<p>風水勘定　馬來先勝</p>
<p>下午一時、陳　德高踞將臺、　　勘定風水、南京首先發難、一路進攻、尚稱得手、不圖平地風皮、馬來於失地之下、加油努力、梁居和發球見喜、球入敵區邊綫、南京挽救托出、巳爲馬來前排鐵閂禁閉、連發皆旋、南京不但得地盡失、且使重寨動搖、心慌意亂下、反以六比十一屈居下風、掉過陣容、積極反攻、顧以眼高手低、無補大局、遂於二十一比十二中結束</p>
<p>後路斷絕　南京再敗</p>
<p>第二局開塲、馬來亞乘初勝餘威、一鼓作氣、連得三分南京亦投桃報李、作同樣之步調、得此南京局血、略有轉機、於八比九時、南京冉勝一分、比數本爲八比十、但紀錄員胡裏胡塗、高呼馬來十一、裁判員遂判令換塲、南京隊及若干觀衆、弄得莫明其妙、後經更正續賽、南京以十一對十換塲、嗣後南京三排軍心鬨變、雖進取有心、而後顧斷絕、卒仍二十一對十七之比冉輸二局、</p>
<p>偶爾失手　鑄成大錯</p>
<p>第三局隻方均增加生力軍應戰、旅進旅退、各無重大建樹、上半塲平平而過、下半塲馬來很勁大發、全隊各有精彩表現、無如好花不常、於十七對十之大差時、偶爾失手即成鑄大錯、南京步步前進、馬來節節退縮、隊長鄭紀敏雖迭傳警報、吩咐方略、但結果以十九對二十一兩分之差、爲南京扳轉一局、</p>
<p>精彩表演　葬送南京</p>
<p>第四局開塲、南京器張更盛、氣　之高、大有扭轉乾坤之企圖、上半塲馬來亞奄奄無生氣、換塲時間、尙是十一比三之差、祗惜南京於此緊要關鍵、自暴自棄、輕易放鬆、馬來亞乃得於瞬息之間、造成平局、南京眼看大好江山、危如累卵、亦振作精神、拚死抵抗、禮讓往來、互有准退、此拳彼腳、各有造就、於是雙方分數接近、競爭益烈、一時砲火震天、彈如密雨、楚爲全塲緊精彩之一幕、至最後五分鐘時、馬來司徒得二排滴度之傳托、高躍壓殺、將南京生命、於絕姆之技巧之一筆抹殺、比較爲二十五比一十三、馬來亞遂以三比一淘汰南京、</p>
<p>（二）廣東勝西藏</p>
<p>西藏棄權　不勞而獲</p>
<p>粵藏之戰、定下午三時開賽、粵隊人員、一時半即到塲練習、迄三時十分、巳逾規定時間、西藏隊仍未到塲遂由裁判員宣告該隊棄權、勝利屬於廣東、茲將廣東隊陣綫誌後、</p>

<p>蒙古摔角隊到達後、即與華北各處摔角選手作友誼比誼、第一對爲敖爾那蘇圖（蒙）對魏德海（平）、魏亦魁梧奇偉、蓋亦平方選手出之矯矯者、一經開手、不一合為敖傾倒於地、第二對爲巴圖爾（蒙）對單世俊（平）、單入塲時、又爲嘗此　味、必別有一番興趣、故與蒙人相對、手舞足蹈、束摇西擺、以示歡欣之意、及雙方問手、單擬扭住巴圖爾衣角、但蒙人摔角衣旣　釘銅釘、且係皮革所製故、亦無從扭件、反被巴圖爾執　衣背、反手推去、單即不支創地、第三對　巴達碼（蒙）對李振淸（滬）、亦不一合而倒地、此時有老將畢鳳亭、坐視蒙人之猖獗、故自告奮勇、挺身出塲、與蒙人一决雌雄、以害三人戰敗之恥、應戰者爲布和（蒙）警笛一聲、畢即撲前與鬥、相持良么、畢尚能支持、於是一般觀衆、均大鼓掌、不幸老將偶一不愼、被布和運用蠻力、將畢揮倒地上、畢老遂氣憤而退、　四對爲薩嗎達恩札木（蒙）對卜恩富（冀）、下身體較爲瘦小、自知非力之所可勝者、乃別圓致勝之道、及雙方戰興、下悉取守勢、但蒙人力大如牛、執住下之雙袖、將下拖　、幾幾入危境、幸卜巧於應用、未致倒地、卜乃待機而發、一度爲卜所乘、將薩嗎執住衣袖、向前猛拖、並用頭頂術、項住薩嗎之胸、同時再起右脚、勾住薩嗎左脚、薩嗎竟不支、向左倒轉、但薩嗎體力甚大、反　此機會、運用全身壓向卜身、兩人同時倒地、而卜倒在下、遂告失敗、嗣後各地選手均裹足不前、雖尚有二次摔角、但終告失敗、究其失敗原因、不盡力之不遜、蓋蒙人所穿摔角衣服、均係特製、對方極難扭住、故有力難用、有術難施、實失敗之最大原因也、</p>

<h3>體育館散記</h3>
<p>體育館中新添置　體育館裏有了一件新添置、就是　了一架很大的無綫電播音機、館裏館外均有分機、一會兒京戲、一會兒歌曲、煞是熱鬧、可是比賽時、就覺得有點碍事了、它的聲音、和裁判員的笛覺混台、有淆混不淸之弊、後至臨時停止、於休息時或每塲比賽終了時、再為播、</p>
<p>各種不同的吼聲　連日比賽情勢緊張、各隊均組織啦啦隊大啦特啦、男子所發的聲音、有時如人猿泰山　吼聲有時如金剛影片中金剛之吼聲、女子所發生　聲音、則如軍艦上或工廠里所發出廻聲有時如獅子的吼聲、小說刺人耳鼓、其他種種　聲如果有時音　收　　的話、　可成　怪聲　觀、</p>
<p>好漂亮的服裝　上海和馬來女籃球選手之服裝、極其漂亮之至、上海爲黃綢衣紅字紫褲、色彩强烈、馬華隊則桃色衫子、雪白的袴子、玉臂盡露、色彩鮮艷、比賽時、旣如彩蝶紛飛、又如散花天女、幾位太太小姐輕輕的說、好漂亮的服裝啊</p>
<p>頭髮上的鑑別　前日廣東對靑島之女子籃球賽、廣東姑娘盡爲盪髮者、靑島女郞則反是、故裁判員大感便利、蓋執行裁判時、可無需看兩隊運動衣之隊名、在頭髮上即可鑑別也、</p>
<p>跑不得也哥哥　體育館內之籃球塲、構造極精、地面平滑異常、一般內地之運動員、從未上過此種塲所、加之技術又差、於是大翻觔斗、一步一跌、如上滑油山、大有胞不得也哥哥之嘆、</p>
<p>賭鷄蛋糕兩塊　靑島馬來之戰、有兩位看客賭輸嬴、一個買靑島的票、一個買馬來的票、賭的物品是大鷄蛋糕兩塊、結果賭靑島的勝了、賭馬來的、祇好揉揉肚子挨餓、</p>

<h3>中學生　學習担負和敎學時間問題（二）</h3>
<p>— 一平</p>
<p>撇開錯誤的觀察和推論、讓我們把中學敎學時數來作一個縱橫的考察、先講縱的方面、民國紀元前十年即淸光緒二十八年、學部規定中學各科敎學時數爲每週三十六小時、民國元年敎育部規定男子中學第一年三十三小時、第二年三十四小時、第三四年均各三十五小時、女子中學各年級較男子中學各年級均各遞减一小時、即由三十二至三十四小時、十八年國民政府敎育部公布暫行課程標準、規定初中爲一白八十六學分、高中爲一百五十六學分、平均初中每一學期為三十一學分、高中爲二十六學分、當時規定學分底定義是、一每學期每週上課一小時爲學分、但圖畫·工藝·音樂、體育及自然之實騐、無的課外預備·自修·或預備、自修時間較少者應須景折算、所以事實上三十一學分至少是每週三十五六小時、而二十六學分至少是每週三十三四小時、因爲高中底自然科學學分較多、次講橫的方面、歐洲重要國家內、以法國和意國中學底敎學時間爲較少、法國一九三一年四月所　行的中學敎學時數表二年級每週二十小時、三年級至六年級每週最少爲一十二小時、最多爲二十三小時半、七年級之哲學班爲二十四小時、算學班爲二十五小時、但體育和由敎空內所發生之課業討論會等都沒有計算在這些時數內、意國中學在前段Ginnaio內、年級每週二十一小時、一年級至五年級每週二十四小時、後段Liceo內年級至三年級每週均各二十六小時、理科中學底Liceo內、一年級每週二十五小時、二年級至四年級均各二十六小時、也和法國底情形一樣、體育底時數沒有計算在內、德國是一個苦幹的國家、舊有的各種中學內、古文中學和文實中學底第六級和第五級、即一二年級、每週均各二十四小時、第四級至上一級、即三年級至九年級每週自二十六至二十八小時、實科中學、新制文實中學和德文中學底第六級至第四級均各二十五小時、下二級至上一級則自二十六至二十八小時、歐戰後新興的建立中學是由下三級至上一級的六年制中學，各年級每週鍛少二十八小時、最多三十小時、平均二十九小時、各中　內　沒有將體育時數計算在內、俄國是一僩硬幹的國家、她底中學前段三年是繼續統一勞工學校而稱爲五年級、六年級和七年級、五年級每週三十五小時、六七年級均各三十六小時、後段二年稱爲八年級九年級、分爲師範·合作·行政等科　科又分組、各組中除三數組每週爲三十六或三十七小時外　餘均各爲三十八小時、此數內已將體育時數計入、英國中學辦法很不一致、但英敎育部曾通令收受十二歲至十六歲的中學可採用其所提示的敎學科目及時數喪、此表規定每週敎學自三十五至三十七小時（未完）</p>

<h3>各種治淋法瑣談</h3>
<p>— 袁一民醫師</p>
<p>治淋之藥品，療淋之電械，可謂夥矣，然概括言之，只有四項療法，二）電療法，考電療法之意義，是以熱力殺菌，所謂透熱殺菌是，此項電療法中，惟短波透熱電療機爲最有價値，有運用富爾國電機及長波透熱電機者，要皆難收相當之效甚或因此而反使愈期延長，更遑言其灼傷肌膚等之流弊矣。此外在急性尿道淋時，用水銀石英燈之冷光照射，所謂光度滅菌是，亦有相當效力。（二）注射法，色素及混合淋苗交互施用，一以藥力殺菌，一以自動免疫，可謂妥善。（三）內股法，當擇具有强大之滲力及消炎殺菌止痛之專製劑，德商美靈洋行之「滅殺淋」，可謂於此數點美備無遺，（四）局部療法，通常恒以蛋白銀等洗射，是乃藥力直接殺菌法，若時間與藥液濃度不適當，則勞而無功，不及菌苗直接免疫法多矣，德國滿爾志大藥廠出品之「淋毒舒樂耳，」係淋菌血淸與舒樂耳之製劑，爲治尿道淋之專劑，現歸本埠仁壽西藥社經售，凡患琳而因或種限制未得就醫者，若用「減殺淋」及「淋毒舒樂耳」自療，亦能期收佳果，且無分男女，施用便利，尤是長處。但是否淋病，尚未能定斷時，自當就醫檢騐爲妥。本埠法租界寗波路六六號春在醫院凡醫療上所用之電械，羅致均全，聘有男女醫師，專治內外各科及一切花柳疾患，對於淋疾，治療上設備尤爲周詳，如眞空管短波透熱電機及最新療濁機等，均屬最佳之品，洵爲盡治療之能事矣。</p>
<h3>性神經衰弱與腦神經衰弱的異點</h3>
<p>— 醫師崔馥卿</p>
<p>性神經衰弱就是性器管神經發生衰弱疾病，也就是性神經極容易興奮，也極易疲勞，生殖器障碍，如性交或生殖不能等，有選精，早洩，陰萎等顯著症候，火都基因於房事過度和手淫等等。</p>
<p>腦神經衰弱症，便是全體神經衰弱症的症候，最顯著的便是腦部，常有壓迫感和重感，思想滯鈍，記憶不佳，頭暈目痃，消化不良，心悸，失眠，腰酸，四肢無力等種種病症，亦漸漸發生，致全身無處不病，已到了神經衰弱最嚴重的時期，起因亦有好幾種，性神經衰弱症加重或精神作業太甚，都可以造成腦神經衰弱症，患性神經衰弱症，並不一定兼患腦神經衰弱，患腦神經衰弱症，却常兼有性神經衰弱症，但無論是腦神經或性神經衰弱症，病源都是神經衰弱，身體內燐質和內分泌液缺乏，不能適當營養各部器管所致，所以服殺可靠的燐質和內分泌製劑，即可挽救，藥物中如「仁壽西藥社」經售之「安爾神」，乃有充分之燐質和內分泌，治神經衰弱之專劑，依法服之，自收佳効，（編者按：崔馥卿醫師善治神經衰弱症，舉凡遺精，早洩，頭暈頭重等關於神經系之一切疾患，莫不應手前效，故有專家之譽，其所費用之「安爾神」本埠永安先施兩大公司西藥部及南洋五洲華成等大藥房均有出售，每盒一元五角。</p>
<h3>胃病與胃寳</h3>
<p>— 魏尊三醫師</p>
<p>胃臟疾患中之最習見者，厥爲急性慘性之胃加答兒，胃酸過多及胃液漏等等，其顯著之症狀，大都爲胃痛，嘔吐，噯氣，吞酸等，考此等情狀之處置，藥物上恒施用亞兩加里劑，如同時加以强有力之止痛劑加則可說服之，瞬見奇效，本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社所經售之諸般藥品，均爲醫界所贊道，其中「胃寶」一藥，係豐富之亞爾加里製劑，含有强力之止痛成份，用以治療急慢性胃加答兒及胃酸過多症等，舉凡一切胃痛，噁心，嘔吐及適宜於亞爾加里劑之服用者，服之無不立奏奇效，醫界前輩高訪翁君樂用此藥，聞其價每盒二元云。</p>
<h3>疥癬治愈記</h3>
<p>— 何天祿醫師</p>
<p>林步雲君患疥癬症，屢醫罔效，亘五六年，其間有時雖亦能奏效，顧都經過若干時日，又復再發如故，虛擲金錢，備嘗苦痛，今年五月，就余治療，見其膿痂散處，體無完膚，自訴療癢難忍，入夜更劇，正發生劇甚之時，遂囑其向本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社購「滅絕菌」塗治，不句日間，竟獲出余意表之功效，約連搽二週，竟將數載之痼疾，消滅凈盡，於今數月，未曾再發，有此靈藥，息皮膚病者，可以無慮矣。（編者按：滅絕菌爲中外馳名之皮膚病治療聖劑，久爲醫界所公認，本埠永安先施及南洋五洲及西門和平路華成等大築均有出售，每盒一元·）</p>

<p>治療淋疾，固以短波透熱電療及混合淋苗之注射爲第一·然有時因地域，時間，金錢等等關係之限制時，則非藉自療之法不可，自療一法，普通病家所可旋行者，惟內服與局部療治而已，內服藥當推德商美監洋行出品之「減殺淋」，以其有比衆强烈之滲透粘膜力，前經張守銘醫師論文推獎以來，早己馳譽醫林，卽一般病家，亦多樂用，至於外用藥，通常恒以藥液殺菌法，此法在醫者施諸病人，猶可斟酌病情而定時間及濃度，若病家自己施行，必無良好成績，現今德國滿爾志大藥廠發明淋病尿道局所用藥「進淋毒舒樂耳」，係用淋病血淸製成，注入尿道局部，因有自動免疫之力，勝如注射混合淋苗，故能收準確治愈之功。</p>
<h3>戒煙應注意之點</h3>
<p>— 吳魯堂醫師</p>
<p>煙癮之成也，非一朝一，欲圖穩妥戒除，豈粗暴急切之處置，克臻佳果。雖然現今戒煙之方，已極書美善之能事，只須運用適宜，自無不克戒除者。但如何防止其疾病，如在戒時所習見者，遺精，失眠，泄瀉及四肢酸楚等等現象。如何增進其體力，如戒絕後之身體疲勞，精神不振等，如何消滅其煙癮，藥劑之選擇，體質的研究，時期之注意，在在均有密切關係，差以一毫，卽遺就戒者以不快。老友余雷，精理內科，前往就戒者，日必數十，其對於戒煙之經騐和手段，豐富老到，現懸壺於本埠法租界寗波路六六號春在醫院內，聞其戒煙辦法，按日針藥費僅收二元，不計成癮年數及吸煙數量，對於戒烟病人之出診，亦特予優待云</p>
<h3>女子淋疾的自療</h3>
<p>— 劉玄女醫生</p>
<p>女淸生以隱病，往往羞於就醫，特別是感染到淋疾以後，因女子淋疾的症候，初不過輕徵之白帶症而已，若任此遷延，則必釀成後患，甚或因罹腹膜炎而致死。患本症者最好就醫，否則亦不宜任變幻，應求自療，自療之法厥惟內服和外用，內服藥當推「滅殺淋」，外用藥當推「淋毒舒樂耳」，一一者兼互行之，卽數年之頑疾，亦可指日痊愈，（編者按：劉玄女士精治婦女子宮疾患，現懸壺於法租界寗波路六六號春在醫院，其所贊述之滅殺淋及淋毒舒樂耳二藥，現均爲法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售，聞永安先施及南洋五洲西門和平路華成藥房等均有出售。）</p>

<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>患者李君，急性前尿道淋，症狀，排劇痛，分泌膿液甚多，荏苒三日，未加醫藥，余囑其向本埠法租界八仙橋敏體蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社，購「滅殺淋」內服及「淋毒舫樂耳」注入尿道，經過約近旬，膿點全無，尿液澄淸，復囑其向協和病理化騐所檢騐，鏡檢之結果，已無淋菌，僅少許膿細胞及表皮細胞而已。患者徐某，亞急性前部尿道淋，症狀，已無急劇炎症及痛苦感，惟膿液分泌仍夥，感傳巳有二週，曾注射色素及伐克辛數針並購服市上普通淋病藥，未獲良效，囑其施用「淋毒舒樂耳」行尿道局部注入，按日二回行之，並內服「滅殺淋」片之，如是安然經過，凡近二旬，病巳霍然然，膿滴旣無，鏡檢亦未見有淋菌。</p>

<h3>吿全國運動大會</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>第六屆全國運動大會，已於國慶日，在本市體育塲，舉行開幕典禮。這次各地參加的單位，有三十八個，選手共二千餘名，爲大會的新紀錄。是日中外觀衆，計有十萬人之多，呈空前熱烈的盛况。足見我國人對於體育，已有相當的認識。我國素有東亞病夫之譏，國人今後倘能本强國强種的信念，大家致力於體格的訓練，則民族前途，未始沒有復興的希望。</p>
<p>然我們對於我國的提倡體育，尚覺有一二缺點和錯誤。本來提倡體育，目標在使國人的體格，得趨於健康之途。而要達到這目的，則須謀體育的普及，俾全國國民，無論男女老幼，都知體育的重要，個個實行有益的運動。但我國提倡體育，每忽略及此。先前只在學校中，設有體育的科目。近來雖也能漸顧到民衆運動方而，惟只仍限於一部分人而已，還談不上普及二字。致大多數國人，尚沒有參加運動的機會。這不能不說是一個最大的缺點。</p>
<p>再則提倡體育，目的旣在强身，便不能僅以奪取錦標爲鼓勵。運動會的舉行，用意在使運動員有表演其運動技能的機會，及引起人民對於體育的注意。在一個運動會中，我們固然希望有優美的成績可收獲。但若一味鼓勵運動員競爭錦標，這只能養成幾個選手，造成幾項紀錄而已，未免有失體育的眞意義。我國一般運動員，每爲出風頭而運動。且學校的提倡體育，又都有藉運動爲學校廣告者。這種態度，甚屬錯誤。</p>
<p>以上兩點，我們認爲有改正的必要。故當這全國運動會舉行之時。特之提出來說一說。希望一班熱心於體育的國人，加以注意。</p>
<h3>葡萄</h3>
<p>— 月山</p>
<p>同庽的朋友送給我一枝葡萄，還帶着兩張葉子；葉子雖已半枯，但襯着纍纍的圓珠，也還覺得非常可愛。我沒有食掉牠，我掛在棹角的坐燈旁，屋里頓時生了光彩，很調和。綠燈紗罩灑出黃綠的光，柔和地映在那些圓珠子上面，更覺可愛了。</p>
<p>由葡萄我想起一個曾和我一塊兒偸食葡萄的朋友。那位朋友是隨着東北的淪亡而失踪了，和我已別了三年，沒有一點消息。</p>
<p>三年前，我們在個山坡上的敎會學校里念書，學校旁邊是一座大菓園，種着滿山的葡萄，那是爲着釀酒用的。我見過校役們一桶一桶地抬到大廚房里去釀酒，穿黑長衫的外國神父，紅着臉，說着頗流利的中國話，敎給那些校役們這麽做那麽做；一桶桶的葡萄，就眞是珍珠似的向我們發笑，但我們學生食不着一個。因爲菜園里是神父們的住宅，我們進不去的。</p>
<p>但我有了那位朋友，那位同偸葡萄的同伴以後，我却常常食着葡萄。怕全校只有我們兩個不守規則：爬過短牆，蹲在葡萄架下躡手躡足地食個夠，還時時裝了一大包出來。</p>
<p>「走」他不多說話，只一個字。那東北人持有的粗紅臉上很自然地便露出幾絲笑，眼神示意着。我們便默默地走出宿舍，繞過大松林，向菓園走去。每次都是他邀我，他膽大，會微笑，微笑里裝着幾分把握，這是使我不忘的，他個子大，粗蠻勁他滿有，那忠於洋主人的校役，他不怕；他常常駡他們，駡他們洋狗。</p>
<p>在菓園里，有一次我們是讓一個校役碰見了。那校役很和氣，並不給我們怎樣的難堪，只輕輕地說：「韓先生，　神父在亭子那邊呢。」</p>
<p>韓先生並不理他。我望着那校役的背影遠了，有點駭怕，我說：「走吧，這一大蒲包也够他們幾個食的了。」</p>
<p>「不理他，什麽×神父！」是那麼蠻橫，仍是扭過臉去摘葡萄，那可愛的圓珠子。</p>
<p>過了一會兒，果然葡萄架邊出現了一位穿黑袍的洋人。圓珠子變成了神父可怖的臉。我從底下看上去：一雙長大的黑皮鞋，亮亮的；再上：黑緞袍子在隨風擺動：再上，圓珠子上面是一個可怖的臉，憤怒的眼，射出猛獸所有的眼光。我傻了，因爲我記得我們碰見他已不止一次。</p>
<p>老韓揪一下我的大樹下擺，我就隨着他走。園子裏是眞靜，綠色的葉子上，撒滿了黃昏的光。</p>
<p>「喂，你們！」老神父說着，　着跟了上來叫我們站住，我們站住了。自然我們得到一頓敎訓，老神父還說什麼等都熟了大家誰都可以食到的騙人話；說是私人的住宅不要隨便進去，私自進去，還摘葡萄，就是偸東西。</p>
<p>「走，不理他。」老韓說；我也膽怯地跟着他走，這對於老神父自然是一種不敬，但「偸東西」灌到老韓的耳裏，他是不服氣的；他就有這股子蠻勁。</p>
<p>奇怪的是第二天學校當局並不怎麼樣我們，雖然我們對老神父不恭敬，甚至於是侮辱了他，不理會他的敎訓。</p>
<p>可是老韓却仍不服氣。他在操塲遇見了那洋狗校役，他打了那校役，打得很重；說是我們食葡萄沒有你門校没什麽事。</p>
<p>學校記了他的過，罪名是欺壓工友。我記得是這樣。</p>
<p>記過由他記過，葡萄我們還繼續地偸，我們跑到園子的一角，人所不常到的地方去偸；一直到全校的校役抬着大桶子大批地摘，大批的往廚房送，我們才不偸了。</p>
<p>這是三年前的事，我還記得很淸楚。對着柔綠光裏的葡萄，我很想那蠻樸的老韓；可是我連老韓的生死也不大淸楚了。記得他離校時很憤慨，那是東北失後的第一年，他沒有了家裏的接濟，念不了書；甚至他連家也找不着，一年來未曾得過家裏的片紙隻字；就成了沒有家的人。因爲欠了太多的錢，廚房停了他的飯，他才走。他說：「此處不留爺，還有留爺處。』我問他到什麼地方去，他說是去考什麼鐵路的練習生，但他沒有帶一本書，我知道。</p>
<p>我目送着洋車拉着他和一綑舖蓋捲兒下了山坡，孤零零地。</p>
<p>棹角的葡萄變成了洋車的輪在我腦裏轉。</p>
<h3>抄靶子</h3>
<p>— 樂筧</p>
<p>因爲在旅途上宿夜，懷鄉的情結是會更輕易地掛在心頭的；偶然想念離開墟市這個帶着幾分神秘的地方，已是兩雙手的手指所不雊掄算的十四个年頭了。父親那些未通音信的鄉黨親朋，可還在那洪荒時代的墟市上生活着嗎？</p>
<p>十五里半，今天的路程。</p>
<p>天光微明的大淸早，林子邊的淸樸的店家，茅屋上裊裊的晨烟，和着酣適的高爽的秋風，織成一片眩目的風光。在貝殼窗裏照亮了的冷房中，我的微睡給山鷄的長啼，和牛犢的臯鳴駕醒，想到昨夜初來投宿的時候，沒有山鷄，沒有牛　，才覺得這兩種聲音　　　新，山中的早晨那麽的淸新。</p>
<p>店主人是一個上了年紀的人，身材魁偉，有着一張「稻草人」式的嘴臉，他穿着黑色的馬褲，紮着靱厚的土布腰帶，據說，以前他是一個鏢客；現在他雖則幹着這營生，也許還沒有忘記早年那種游離的生活，他的行經看上去像個奇傳中的有來歷的好漢；但是交談起來，却只覺得他是可親的，目光放射着俠義的豪氣。</p>
<p>「大師，起早呵！」早晨看見他老，我機械地作了一揖。</p>
<p>「嗚！起早，起早。」他也同樣地選敬一下。</p>
<p>「咱說，到墟裏去的路上可沒有……」</p>
<p>「那個，那個不大……不過出出沒沒而已！」</p>
<p>又是帶着悚懼的心情，結束這一席話：我早就知道這十五里半的山徑，是更險峻了；我又不願再打迂廻，延長這遼遠的旅程，我的歸心正像一枝流矢，是悚懼和猶豫所抵擋不住的，終於又收拾起包袱，忽怱地就道了。</p>
<p>當首所看見的還是遼闊的平原，稀疏的紫杉亭亭地四處立着，朝暾爬在黃色土壞上，亮成金黃的山陽，和絳紫的山陰。再經過寥寥幾座的瓦窰，穿過幾處的瓦埕，路便漸漸地引上山腰，在禿山上打迂迴，和繞山坡了。</p>
<p>一個紫杉的長葉林阻着前路，心間始怦悴地跳躍着，他們也不過爲了生活的抽策，或是不願丟開老巢他去，模地繼承他們袓先的事業，企圖苟延這一輩子。便在這閉塞的冷山裏打獲，我不是押貨的商賈，我是飄泊歸來的輕身人，曾伴着輕輕的行囊，踏遍了天涯的烟霞，像我這樣的年輕人，怕綁架的不測嗎！我想。</p>
<p>在林子裏，隱隱地聽見三兩聲口嘯，夾着淫褻的單調的山歌。一剎那間，冷不防地截來二個，全是古老的穿着，過穿着只能夠在社戲班裏找到的。</p>
<p>喂，上墟去的？解下來，解下來！」聲勢汹汹地搶上來。</p>
<p>「有槍枝，嘿，走火器！」另一個便搶去我的包袱。</p>
<p>他們老練地攤開我的包袱，扯起衣服在空中裏抖着，沒有什麽；在我的身上搜着，也沒有什麽，沮喪地使着眼色，把地上的衣服一脚踢開，帶着鄙視的神色揚長而去。</p>
<p>「窮小子，想不通倒有秀才氣！」我收拾起包袱，很藉地走出林子，長葉的杉　拂着這樓餘音。</p>
<p>曳長的　嘛，和　褻的　訛重新地響徹山寨。</p>

<h3>彷徨</h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>鵝絨那樣的歌聲，從對面的一座小學校裏，給靜穆的秋風帶來時，我似乎更其悒　了。</p>
<p>那歌聲，由那些小學生們的尖銳的聲帶上發出，是含着純粹的活潑的格調的。可是，我狹窄的地對那些歌聲嫉妬，憎恨了。事實上，我的嫉妬與憎恨是實用的，是無用的！</p>
<p>於是，我面對着窗外：飲着秋風，飲着悒　。</p>
<p>幼年的時候，我沒有好好地受過敎育，隨着忙碌的父親東西的奔跋，無休止地已經是有那麼多的年頭了。那棵庭前幼時所植的石榴樹，長得也比我高了。祖母所愛好的貓，和她自己，也隨着時日而龍鐘。祗說那頭黃花色的貓吧，牠的右眼已瞎，走路時眞像幽靈似的，死沉的氣色壓住了牠的行動與呼吸……</p>
<p>呵，一切都衰老了，連我的那只從小就有的紅色的木頭面盆，也因年老而漏水了。</p>
<p>在黑黬的燈光下，在早晨的小溪邊，在吃午飯的時候，我總是看見父親那麽疲倦地打着呵欠。是的，他也年老了呵。</p>
<p>望着他的呵欠，我深深地害怕：</p>
<p>「到了他的年紀，也許我會整天躺居　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　無聊的念頭一閃過，又回　到我的幼年時代了：「我得好好地做人呵！」我常常這樣地自慰着，而且父親也常常這麽類似的來向我嘮叨。</p>
<p>於是，我在日記本上，敎科書上，或是抄書本上，都寫下了：努力為人」。並且，還告訴父親：</p>
<p>「我要做一個有爲的靑年！」</p>
<p>當時，我深信我的言語是可以十足兌現的。我茫然地就迷惑在我自己的言語裏了。我從沒有想一想：「怎樣才能做一個有爲的靑年？」</p>
<p>光陰把我的年靑　蝕完了。我已經躊躇在中年的道上，我原是一個我呵！不過，父親是顯得年老了，他的嘮叨也完了，跟他在一起時，除了一種沉重的太息以外，我簡直聽不見什麽東西。在他的沉重的太息裏，我醒悟了。我直爽地承認我的想念是不對的！</p>
<p>「我不能和祖母的貓見那樣不懂事的呵！」我醒悟了。然而，粗重的中年的鐵鏈已經鎖住了我。</p>
<p>「我不能因了中年的鐵鏈的粗重而辜負了我的醒悟！」那麽地想着，我似乎獲得了一個新的環境。但是，我不知道怎樣應用我的醒悟？</p>
<p>每天聽到對面小學校裏的活躍的歌聲時，我益發苦痛，益發悒鬱了。</p>
<p>祇是一霎那的時間吓，唱歌的人將趕上我了。</p>
<p>把沉重的腦袋，埋到自己的手裏去時，父親又在太息了。而那淸脆的歌聲似乎更嘹響，更輕快！</p>
<h3>請客（續）</h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>所以關於朱大爺的謠言是罄竹難書：有的說是販私鹽的，有的說上海的製毒機關就設在朱大爺宅子里，更有說朱大爺勾結了海上的綁票頭子，供結他們做藏票的所在…其實朱大爺除了竭力撈錢之外，就沒有做過犯罪的事。做一任官，撈牠十萬八萬，這是將本求利，說不上犯罪；他有田地，放給佃戶們種田，到年底收租。收租祗合六釐利息，所以朱大爺家的斛子比米行里的要大一些，這自然也說不上犯法。不過朱大爺太視錢如命，譬如佃戶們還租，例有一頓午飯，吃倉里的，但是朱大爺祗折了二十大錢，在賬房里貼一張紅字條：「本宅佃戶衆多，槪不供給飯食，每人折大錢二十年」。這點是朱大爺結怨於人的。不過那些佃戶是祗能造造謠言而已，他們就不敢不還租，或是短少一個錢；至於對朱大爺有什麼不敬事件，那是保證是不會發生的，出進於朱大爺之門的都這鎭上這幾個頂兒尖兒的大人物呢。</p>
<p>但是朱大爺今天大請其客了，兩扇烏黑的大門開了個直，兩邊一齊列的肅靜迴避的大牌，正中有大門燈掛着，一直到第三進花廳上，在門外的人可以瞧一個爽快。廳堂都是銀臺面，太陽光照着那樣耀耀地迷糊了人們的眼睛，迷糊了人們的心。那些頂兒尖兒的人物當然一早坐了大轎到朱府來，這是不足爲奇的。所奇的；據發請帖跑腿阿二說：這回事才怪呢，朱大爺連那些大佃戶都請到了，看樣子有十來桌酒好吃哩！這自然是怪事，那些接到請客帖的，竟有一個大字都不識的赤脚人（註三）在內，上一天這鈸上就有些亂哄哄了，大家奔走相告，對於朱大爺的突然大謂其客疑惑有什麽不幸的事要臨到各人的頭上來。大家齊聚在福興茶園里，談了一整天的還是談不出結果來。膽怯的主張不去，但是要有禍事發生的話，總逃不了朱大爺的手掌的。那末，有些人主張去擾他一頓大肉大魚再說，鄉下人終年吃不到那麽好的酒菜的！</p>
<p>於是：赤腳的，穿破大褂的，滿滿地坐了朱大爺的一花廳，這兩扇烏黑大門內的秘密總算被他們看到了一點。每　東西都是新鮮的，見所未見的，就是那些大魚大肉，也和他們家裏燒的更有味道。大家吃呵吃的酒過半巡，本鎭的地保站起來說話了。平時他和一班赤脚人同樣祇能在後棣賬房里坐坐，現在他穿起袍子大褂，像模像樣笑着道：</p>
<p>「今朝朱大爺請你們吃酒，這實在是…很好的事，因爲，現在省里要徵畝損，鎭上？諸位爺們，因爲，朱大爺做人公正，已經把他…朱大爺報上去了，朱大爺做了畝捐官，對於你們，也是有好處的，所以，請你們吃酒，大家應該帮朱大爺的忙，要是縣里，傳你們去問話，你們要說出朱大爺好…朱大爺是好的…唔，大家多喝一杯酒，知道嗎？朱大爺是好的…」地保結結巴巴的把剛才計劃了半天的話僅說出了一半，他望望朱大爺，這些話說錯了沒有？</p>
<p>朱大爺點點頭。朱大爺是好的，那些赤脚的也知道的，這畝捐官正又是一筆好外快。可是這席酒在每個人肚里作怪，沒有一個人點頭。</p>
<p>知道嗎？大家都是知道得挺明白的。</p>
<p>（註一）倉里卽田主。</p>
<p>（註二）十棣九天井，形容房的寬大非眞有十進屋子與九個天井也。</p>
<p>（註三）赤脚人，藐視農夫之意。</p>
<h3>搬家</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>隨着搬一次家，心境卽起了一次變化，而我總因此太息起來，爲什麽老是要用一些無所謂的事情來麻煩自己。三年來，記不淸搬過幾多回的家了，從熱閙的地方住到冷靜的地方，又從冷靜的地方住到熱鬧的地方。住在冷靜的區域的時候，如果一天不出門，就好像忘記了世間，聽得到的只有窗外搖曳在微風里輕細的果樹的聲音，嫌太寂寞，感到彷彿被一切的人所擯棄似的孤獨起來，於是搬走；一搬當然便是搬向很熱鬧的環境去了，街道也許就在臨窗之下，每天打淸早起，各樣車輛的驕音一直繼續到深夜猶未停止，耳朵內老是嗡嗡地嚮着，簡直什麼事都不能做，心情無論如何沒法安寗，弄得漸漸煩燥，覺得再遷延下去，說不定會變成神經衰弱，於是又搬家，這遭兒卽是從熱鬧的地方搬到冷靜的地方。新屋離市街很遠，車子的鬧聲在夜深的時間才可隱約聽見，已是十分零落了。這完全無　於我需要一個較長久的聞靜的心情的醞釀。而屋後正是鄰居的園圃，秋意已深，花卉是不見了，草塲上只留着高叢梧桐孤傲地站立着，葉子雖黃了不少，也落滿一地了，有些顯出憔悴；但在太陽照射的白天，它還能雊投一幅蔭影在地上，聽到有一陣噃嗦的音韻，另後又蔌簌地飄墮，我知道是梧桐葉受到一度無情的風神的摧殘。</p>
<p>幾個月來，我是雊憊乏了，急欲找尋一個處所大大地休息一下，如今還屋子是極適宜的。若沒有意外的事或什麽必要，打算長遠一點的住下去，不再輕易地搬，其實我的搬家原是非常簡單，沒有箱囊之類的累墮東西，甚至於幾遭被窩也沒有，要搬便立刻搬，不過把一個人搬到另一個地方而已。討厭的倒是看房子的事，住往跑了一整天，連腿子也跑麻了，結果還不能愜意。等到房子找定，事情也就完了。想起三年之間，起初的搬家，總是一車子一車子的行李，那時搬家的辛苦實在嗜到一些，以後搬了一次物件便少了一次，逐漸地减少到勝下了一付光棍身子。早些時，因爲牽掛過多，對於搬家的確不大願意，一方面也是不容易搬得動。到了身外無長物，只是一個人而已，家便搬得動了。從搬家的事情，每每會不禁回味着這些日子個人生活的痕跡，以及變化，有些惘然了；這些日子我住過容猍的鴿子籠式的亭子間，住過有着標緻的內容的洋房子，住過陰暗地日里連陽光都瞧不見的地方，也住過出入有電梯代足步的地方。看過許多不同的鄰居者們，看過許多不同鄰居們的生活。而自己，在搬來搬去的當中，感情慚漸闌珊了，思想也漸漸陰鬱起來。家的搬動，彷彿就是人的遭過一樣，有時迎着陽光，有時却只能望見陰暗的影子。再經過幾回的變遷，恐怕人都老了！</p>

<h3>上海振華油漆有限公司史略</h3>
<p>振華油漆有限公司，創立於民國七年，創辦人爲前任經理邵晋卿先生，先生以油漆一物，爲建築材料之必需品，每年漏巵鉅萬，因與樂振葆王雲甫諸先生，籌設製造廠，以期挽回利權，經十餘年之奪鬥，慘淡經營，卒爲我國造漆業之翹楚，爲國貨製造業放一異彩。</p>
<p>該公司爲股份有限公司性質，資本國幣二十萬元，董監事九人，組織董事會，下設經恊理各一人，執行一切事務，現任經理爲秦竟成先生，協理宋沛道先生。製造廠設上海閘北中山路潭子灣，佔地十餘畝，前臨滬杭鐵路，後憑蘇州河，水陸交通，均極便利。廠屋係用最新式水泥鋼骨造成，內分厚漆，調合，煉油，光漆，水粉，鉛粉，鉛丹，諸部，全體機械，均用電力發動，工人凡百餘名，分廠設天津，現正從事擴充，共計發行所四，總發行所設上海北蘇州路四七八號至四八〇號，分發行所設漢口保成路，南京建康路，及杭州新民路，各埠經理及分銷達五十餘處，銷路除本國外，尚有南洋羣島，英荷各屬，曁邏邏等處，僑胞多樂購之。</p>
<p>出品計有</p>
<p>（一）厚漆，（二）調合漆，（三）防銹漆，（四）房屋漆，（五）打磨漆，（六）汽車磁漆，（七）快燥磁漆，（八）光漆，（九）木器漆，（十）精煉漆，（十一）塡眼漆，（十二）水粉，（十三）鉛丹，（十四）鉛粉，（十五）漆油等之十餘種，商標爲飛虎，雙旗，三羊，太極，無敵，牡丹，等六種。全年產量，達二千六百噸以上，上白漆，熟油，改良金漆，快燥磁漆，及最近發行之水粉漆等，爲最著名，原料除一部份顏料自歐美各國定購外，餘均用國貨。</p>
<p>該廠於造漆部份外，另設化騐部，專事分析，各種原料，及出品之成份，並研究其改進方法。又該工程部，專代各界設計，及承辦各項油漆工程，近編有美術圖案一種，髹漆房屋，雅麗美觀，亦一特色也。</p>
<p>國民政府前工商部，以本公司出品精良，曾咨請海陸空軍部，曁各省市政府轉飭所屬，盡量採用，現京滬，滬杭甬，北寗，津浦，膠濟，平綏，隴海，道淸，南潯，諸鐵路，及各省市建設廳工務局，郵政局，曁招商局等機關，均予採用，卽外商所經營之上海英電車公司，太古輪船公司等，亦多用以鬆漆車輛及輪船等等，實爲國貨增光不少。</p>
<p>該公司之設立，旣完全以提倡國貨爲宗旨，對於各種出品，不敢自滿，力求精進，此後尤當努力於研究工作，務使各項出品更臻美善。</p>
<h3>談火磚</h3>
<p>火磚在工業界是極佔重要的，尤其是重工業和琺瑯玻璃等窰貨工業，陶瓷製品在我國有極悠久的歷史，在理與有連帶關係的耐火材料的製造和運用，應有顯著的特長，但是事實昭示我們，中國的工業界老是墨守成規，不易進步，卽以我國最著名的宜興窰貨，江西瓷器製造塲的窰房而論，一直還是用就地的土製磚瓦築成，晚近機械工業日臻發達，每一工廠，鍋爐差不多是必具的，築爐材料迪非昔日土製磚瓦所能勝任，火磚的繁重性，乃日見增加，在最近以前，火磚的來源完全仰給國外，自從開灤媒礦成立，因其自身之需要，乃附設火磚製造廠於塘山，（那裏附近有極優良的原料）其後復因外界需要的孔殷，水到渠成，遂確立而成爲他們的副業，誰也知道開灤是外籍的礦商，國人鑒於金錢依然外流，最近乃有國產火磚的製造。</p>
<p>火磚主要原料是天然耐火石及高嶺十粘土等的混合，我國各地有極好的原料，無庸仰求於國外，火磚最重要的條件，須具有特强的耐火力，和壓力，每一鍋爐和窰房之耐用，與其生產品之良否，全恃上述兩種力量如何而判定其命運，工業界因其關係之重要，採購至爲嚴格，國產火磚間因技術原料的講求不甚精嚴，乃至出品良莠參差不一，常爲提倡國貨的工業家所詬病，而有依然信用外貨的傾向。</p>
<p>定海胡君組庵於民廿一創中國窰業公司，四年來努力經營，所出地球牌火　，　　　　　　　，　　　　　　　壓力高强的二種主要條件以外，更　注意收缩度的减少，定製型式的正確，在國內工業界樹立了很好的信譽，特爲簡單介紹於此，以謀共起提倡，而挽回國產火磗的命運。</p>
<h3>國產油毛毡</h3>
<p>— 巵</p>
<p>油毛毡爲屋項避漏要物，在建築界佔重要地位，吾國國產，向付缺如，故所需悉仰給於舶來品，每年漏扈何止數百萬金，茲有工程師曹克東君，在天津經多年之研究，悉心製造，現並集資創辦建華工業公司於津埠，專造各種油毡，以供吾國各建築之應需，價廉物美，足攫外貨地位而代之。在華北各埠，銷路極廣，各業主無不交相推譽，茲應海上各大建築工程需要。特設駐滬辦事處於北山西路東德安里二衖四十一號，並委本埠各大五金行經銷，俾各建築工程購者便於採辦，務希各大建築師營造廠，熱忱提倡，以增國貨之光，而塞漏巵，是所厚望焉。</p>
<h3>參觀市政府所築成之體育館與游泳池後</h3>
<p>上海市政府，爲提倡體育起見，於民國二十三年，建造體育館，及游泳池，藉以供應本市市民，在業餘時間，鍜鍊體魄，爲運動競技正當之娛樂塲所。此次第六屆全國運動會，在滬舉行，假座斯築，誠爲非常之機會。記者於上述二建築完成之日，參觀內容，其建築材料，係採用國貨者居多，如鋼窗由中國銅鐵工廠承攬，聞南京交通部大厦全部鋼窗，亦槪由該廠製造，精良堅固，非常耐用，游冰池內之瑪賽克，則用興業瓷磚公司出品。</p>
<p>（一）體育館，位於游泳池之北，其方向則爲東面，房屋式樣，取現代建築，與中國建築混合式，全部外牆，均用紅磚，並有人造石之雕刻，故外觀極爲雄偉，內部精雅富麗，殆由市中心區建設委員會董大酉建築師設計，成泰營造廠承造館之正門，內有門廳售票處，大廳，男女厠所，甬道，穿堂，藍球塲，健身房，辦公室，會客室，更衣室，沐浴室，運動器具室，廚房，鍋爐問，由廣永和鍋爐廠承辦，佈置順序，井井有咚，看台一座，能容量有坐位者二千五百，立位一予五百。</p>
<p>（二）游泳池，殆仿照美國大學游泳，競賽規例之尺寸，建造　露大式，四　建有看台，可容坐位五千，立位一千，池之長度爲八十英尺，　度二十英尺，池之深度，最淺一端爲二英尺，最深　二十一　　　，容　　　　　　　　　，池底池邊，均舖砌瑪賽克，淸潔晨常，池中濾水與燈光設備，尤爲特色，本池之旁，閩設一小游泳池，係供兒童游泳之用。</p>
<p>池之內部，自大門進口，內爲大廳售票處，爐子間，男女厠所，縱橫甬道，客廳，辦公室，衣帽室，休息室，游泳器具室，更衣室，販賣所等，佈置週到，整齊雅潔，爲中國設備最良游泳池也。</p>
<h3>吾國之鋼窗工廠史</h3>
<p>吾國之有鋼窗工廠，始自民國十四年，創辦最早者，爲中國銅鐵工廠，該廠專製鋼窗，鋼門之外，並承攬各種銅鐵工程，總經理李賢堯氏，曩年曾任英商某鋼窗廠華經理十餘載，故對於鋼窗構造原理，研究有素，嗣後卽自行置廠於海防路五一三號，占地四畝，近因業務發達，添設第二廠於柳營路宋公園路，廠中設備，槪用新式機械，一切管理，採取科學管理法，故於出品方面，精良迅速，平時僱用工友數約一百六七十名。如國民政府交通部大厦，國民政府文官處大厦，最高法院大厦，外交部官舍大厦，蔣委員長官邸，行政院辦公樓，上海市政府各局辦公室，市中心交通部電局，華業大厦，王伯羣先生住宅，汪精衛先生住宅，孔祥熙先生住宅，陳公博先生住宅，曾仲嗚先生住宅，胡筠秋先生住宅，葉揆初先生住宅，中央衛生署，中央防疫處，中央醫政學院，上海肺病療養院，中華麻瘋療養院，上海市衛生試騐所，中央銀行倉庫，虹口中國銀行，虹口四行儲蓄會，交通銀行倉庫，中國銀行貨棧，靑島金城銀行，靑島大陸銀行，濟南大陸銀行，天廚味精廠，天利淡氣廠，上海市體育館，上海市游泳池，新聞報館，暨本館所用鋼窗，均爲　所承攬裝置，歷有年數，亳無　壞，足　該廠出品之優良。</p>
<h3>益中福記機器瓷電公司新岀品</h3>
<p>國貨釉面墻磚問世　質料色澤駕舶來品之上</p>
<p>福記公司，　完全國人投資所經營，其初岀品，僅　於　機　料，如　壓器，油開　，　　燈瓷料等，行　國内，久　　譽，　民國十八年起，該公司</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>鑒於國內建築事業之勃興，而材料莫不仰給於国外，乃致力於建築材料之創造，所出品如舖地瑪賽克磁磚，其質堅貨美，變乎駕舶來品之上，早為建築界所稱許。最近又充實第二工廠，聘請留美工程專家，精工特造，原有出品外，新出　面墻磚一種，質料堅紉，色澤兼美，洋貨　而却步，國內尤稱無雙，爲國貨建築材料放一異彩。該公司第一第二兩廠，共設新式大　七座，每月可出瑪賽克瓷傳七百餘方丈，釉面墻磚四百餘方丈，業已工竣之四行儲蓄會大厦，及正在興建中之永安公司十七層新厦，均首先採用，其他所建巨厦如南京路大新公司等，亦均爭先恐後，紛向該公司，看樣定貨，而一般營造業者，咸推爲一九三五年最新式，最漂亮之建築材料焉。該公司第一廠設於浦東洋涇，二廠設於霍必蘭路，設總寫字於福州路八十九號，所有出品，均備有樣本，各界前往參觀採購，莫不股勤接待云。</p>
<h3>華新磚瓦公司之槪况</h3>
<p>華新磚瓦公司，創於民國十一年，其時規模未備，祗有大平瓦一種，迨後該公司經理柳子賢君，脫離泰山磗瓦公司，親來主持，乃大改革，五六年來，規模旣備，始有各式平瓦，西班牙，筒瓦，及中國廟宇式筒瓦之出。柳君久任泰山公司總工程師，技術優良，經騐豐富，凡經其手製之品，無不精美絕偷，爲建築界所稱許。</p>
<p>民國二十二年春，柳君鑑於車上水泥花磚，大都乖劣，不堪難以久用，乃悉心研究，頗有心得，於是擴充範圍，購辦最新式，每方寸二千五百磅　壓機，用上好礪質，顏料製成優美花磚，與外貨毫無軒輊。</p>
<p>華新花磚，尺寸準確，質地堅實，花紋淸朗，磚面光潔，爲其他花磚所不及。行銷以來，已遍各埠，最扳南京國民政府大禮堂，林主席別墅，中央黨部黨史，首都飯店，江蘇銀行，杭州浙江大學農學院，航空學校運動塲，湖州東吳大學附屬中學，南昌省政府辦公廳，及航空學校，九江中央銀行，本埠法工部局，喇格納華童公學，中國銀行高級職員住宅，杜月笙先生別默，以及在建築中之大新公司，均採用該公司花磚舖地，該公司出品之受人歡迎足見一斑。</p>
<h3>上海的國產石棉製品</h3>
<p>年來我國工業建築及機械，日臻發達，對於石棉製品之需要日趨增加，因爲求過於供，所以舶來品每年不下百萬元之漏巵，到異域異起初不知道中國有石棉製造廠之設立，最近國外貨之昂貴及交貨之遲緩，所以不得不在中國調査調査，中國國內是否有石棉製造廠之設立，經過……三星期之久首先找到的卽是「振案石棉製造廠」，第二卽是「大東石棉廠」，在未發現各廠以先，所由五金店買到石棉製品，總以爲是外國貨，經調査之結果不然，五金店賣的一半多爲中國買，因爲中國貨比較外國貨並不次，而且功効是一樣的，特別是價錢較外國貨要便宜一半！有時外國貨經理家因爲恐怕誤期交貨被罰的關係，第一補救的方法，就是定中國廠家貨貨，改換招牌來朦混用主，由此證明中國貨是適用的，更足以證明迷信外國貨的人是盲從的，現在拉雜寫在下面幾點，以供建築界購料之參考：</p>
<p>原料　石棉乃係一種石性之儣質，顏色有紅，白，綠，黑，黃，等，長短不一，長的二尺多，短的不及一寸，顏色以白軟的爲最由礦中開出之石塊，到廠家經過一番提煉及碾札之手續，結果由一種硬性之石層中；揀選出一種纖維質，此種質料便爲石棉，牠的特點是不燃燒，冬性溫，夏性寒，並且隔電，止血，要試用石棉之眞偽，是很易的事，只須要自來火一燒，便立刻得到一種確證的答復。</p>
<p>礦區　石棉礦區除四川省有一小部分外，以河北省　源之礦區最廣，產量以淶源最豐，四川省礦區囚爲開採之困難及運輸交通之不便的問題，所以沒有去開採，因爲開採後運到內地，價値與淶源貨相差太遠，現在全國的石棉原料之供給，完全依仗淶源之出產，握有淶源礦區開採權的，爲天津振業石棉製造廠。</p>
<p>工廠　在中國第一大商埠；工廠林立水陸碼頭的上海；要找一家石棉製品的完全工廠是沒有的，比較一般賣石棉泥小販完全的便是大東了，不過大東亦只於石棉管，石棉磗兩種罷了，其他貨品尚付缺如，最近由天津分設的振業石棉製造廠出品，確係完全，因牠自廠有礦，機械完全些，所以出品種類多，不過牠的製造部是在天津的，各貨以振業較廉。</p>
<p>種類　石棉的製品種類很多，詳細的分起來，要到百餘種不止，現在中國的出品有以下各種；石棉元繩，石棉方繩，石棉鉛絲元繩，石棉銷絲方繩，石棉各種膠心盤根石棉各種鉛粉盤根石棉鬆繩，以上各貨均由英尺三分圓徑至三寸，石棉綫是田徑二厘五至三分不等，石棉紙板由二厘五厚至四分不等，石棉傳，石棉管，石棉瓦，石棉帶，石棉泥，石棉手套，石棉靴罩，石棉布，石棉衣褲，石棉馬甲，石棉護髪帽，石棉各種圈墊，石棉枕絨，石棉纖維，石棉爐口，石綿燈心等，各貨皆論尺或論磅不一，各貨濕度，拉力，火力均與外貨無二。</p>
<p>用途　石綿的用途是很大，除去建築材料大銷塲外，餘如機器，鍋爐，火車，兵艦，船廠，飛機，兵工廠，造幣廠，紗廠，保險庫房，救火會，各工廠，以至保險箱櫃等石綿都是一種不可少的東西。</p>

<h3>U.S. Neutrality and International Sanctions</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Now that Geneva has determined to impose sanctions against Italy, outside the League of Nations system are the three major countries of the United States, Japan, and Germany. Among these three countries, the United States is the most noteworthy. During the Great War of 1914, the United States, in its capacity as a neutral country, strongly advocated freedom of the seas, leading to severe clashes with the British Navy. Had it not been for Germany's submarine policy, a decisive battle between Britain and the United States might have been unavoidable. Having learned this lesson, the London authorities must consider the attitude of the United States in any international sanctions, as the United States has the power to break through the international sanctions net, both in trade and in military force, thus rendering Geneva's actions ineffective. However, in recent years, Americans have also awakened to the folly of their actions during the European War. Driven by merchants seeking profit and bankers seeking investment, the United States was drawn into an unnecessary war. Although the war initially brought economic prosperity, the post-war recession soon engulfed the United States. To this day, millions of unemployed people still suffer from the aftereffects of the European War. Therefore, there are many who advocate never getting involved in another world war and voluntarily relinquishing some maritime freedom and neutral rights. The Neutrality Act passed by Congress a few months ago and the recent ban on arms exports to belligerent countries are based on this desire and awareness.</p>
<p>What we should pay attention to now is whether, under this Neutrality Act, when the League of Nations implements sanctions against Italy, the neutral United States will have the opportunity to clash with the League of Nations member states. According to news from Pi Yue, former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson wrote to the New York Times, saying that the U.S. ban on arms exports is not enough to prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex of crisis. The sale of American cotton and other goods to Italy will soon cause serious conflicts between the United States and League member states. Therefore, Stimson advocated expanding cooperation between the United States and the League of Nations to stop the Italian-Ethiopian War. The incompatibility of neutralism and sanctionism is a clear principle of international law. Sanctions use the power of a group to stop and punish a member of the group for illegal acts. Neutral parties, regardless of the group's opinion, do not take a position on right or wrong of each member, who is correct and who is mistaken, and only watch from the sidelines, without taking a hostile or friendly stance towards any party. Therefore, the ban on arms must apply to both Italy and Ethiopia, without limiting trade only against Italy. President Roosevelt's proclaimed ban is narrow in scope, and cotton, copper, and iron, which can be used by Italy to manufacture weapons, are not prohibited from export. However, importing these items into Abyssinia would be impossible for the backward black nation to turn into weapons. This is neutrality that is not neutral. The Neutrality Act passed this year does not prohibit lending and extending credit to belligerent countries, while the League of Nations' financial sanctions plan includes this item. Allowing American bankers to take such an unscrupulous risk means that America's financial power can greatly increase Italy's fighting power, while it is of no benefit to Abyssinia. This is also neutrality that is not neutral. All of these can cause conflict between Geneva and Washington, and the so-called conflict between Geneva and Washington is tantamount to a conflict between Britain and the United States, as only these two countries have large navies on the Atlantic Ocean. However, whether the United States will undermine international sanctions depends entirely on the scope and duration of this war. If the war is short-term and local, the United States will not want to re-enter the mistakes of 1917 for the sake of profit. If not, enticed by Italy and the great development of overseas markets during the war, filled with surplus capital and surplus production, and with unemployed workers and farmers, the United States will not be able to resist the lure of profit and the loss of overseas trade caused by international sanctions, and will come into conflict with Britain. A spark can start a prairie fire, and American public opinion, driven by emotions, may also be drawn into a major war due to the infringement of neutral rights.</p>

<h3>Hubei Gypsum Salt Tax is Under the Jurisdiction of the Ministry</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The gypsum salt produced in Yingcheng, Tianmen, and Gong'an counties in Hubei Province was previously taxed by the Provincial Department of Finance. The Ministry of Finance unified the national salt administration and brought it under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. After negotiations with the Hubei Provincial Government and the Department of Finance, Zhang Fengwu, an auditor of the Salt Affairs Office, was appointed as the Director of the Gypsum Salt Tax Bureau to take over. The gypsum salt tax rate in the province is only 20 cents per dan, while the official salt is 10 yuan per dan. Therefore, in the past, the official salt in the province lost more than 4 million yuan per year due to the popularity of gypsum salt sales. Now that the gypsum salt is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, it will start to increase the tax rate. The funds from the gypsum salt tax that the Provincial Department of Finance should receive each year will still be allocated by the Central Accounting Office. (14th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Stopping the East African War - The League of Nations Encounters Another Touchstone - Delaying Sanction Actions Damages Authority - If It Fails Again, Disaster is Imminent</h3>
<p>(London) Representatives of the member states of the League of Nations General Assembly are actively implementing severe economic sanctions against Italy today. Although it is publicly stated here that Geneva's agile development over the past few weeks aims to promote peace, optimists cannot but worry about the difficulty of the League of Nations' actions and the lack of consensus on sanctions, which may delay its implementation and thus fail to stop the East African war. If so, it is generally believed that the authority of the League of Nations will suffer a fatal blow. World peace advocate Cecil declared today that if the League of Nations fails due to lack of perseverance, disaster will soon break out. If its efforts to stop the war can indeed restore peace and uphold justice, a new era of international issues will see the dawn. (14th dispatch from Guomin)</p>
<h3>International Financial Sanctions Against Italy - Cutting off All Public and Private Political Dealings - Approved by the Committee of Eighteen Nations in Charge</h3>

<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Eighteen Nations held a meeting at 10:30 this morning and passed the financial sanctions measures formulated by the Financial Subcommittee yesterday.

According to our correspondent, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov explained the proposal put forward by his country's representative Potemkin the day before, namely, those countries that refuse to implement Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant should be restricted financially and economically. He also asked the League of Nations to pay attention to the serious difficulties caused by the opposition of Hungary, Australia, and Albania, saying that if a certain country refuses to cooperate with the League of Nations, the entire plan currently being drafted by the League of Nations will inevitably encounter obstacles. The Soviet government's proposal the day before was intended to prevent this. In addition, the chairman of the Committee of Eighteen Nations presented a report outlining the committee's discussions and said that appropriate measures have been taken to keep the contents of the meeting confidential. The representatives of the participating countries were very moved by the chairman's remarks. (14th dispatch from Havas)</p>

(7) Governments of all countries should consult with each other to prohibit the above-mentioned business, whether handled directly by Italy or through persons of any other nationality.</p>
<p>The Committee of Eighteen Nations is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning and will generally approve the above suggestions.

The contents are (a) prohibiting direct or indirect lending of funds to Italy, (b) prohibiting bank loans or other loans, and (c) prohibiting the issuance of bonds on behalf of the Italian government and public institutions or private enterprises within the country. Once this measure is notified to all member states, the governments of each country will notify the Committee of Eighteen Nations of the implementation arrangements. When the Committee of Eighteen Nations discussed the sanctions measures, representatives of several member states requested explanations on the following items: first, whether Italian companies' branches in foreign countries and foreign companies' branches in Italy should be prohibited from remitting funds; second, whether the sanctions measures apply to Italian insurance companies; and third, whether funds allocated by various countries to the Italian Red Cross, which are of a charitable nature, are also prohibited.

<h3>Tense Anglo-Italian Relations - Italy Accuses Britain of Inciting - The Mediterranean Trap Incites Suspicion</h3>
<p>(Rome) A government spokesperson today accused Britain of inciting a tense Anglo-Italian situation, leading to fears of a European war. According to the Min Sheng Bao, Britain is now determined to expand the war to defeat fascist Italy. The concentration of the British Navy in the Mediterranean only incites suspicion. Who believes Eden's claim that the British do not want to provoke Italy? According to the naval authorities, British warships have not returned salutes to Italian ships since October 7, which can be said to disregard international etiquette. This kind of provocative and infringing behavior makes Italy have to be on guard. (14th dispatch from Guomin)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa - Thousands of Ethiopian soldiers are now passing through Jijiga to the Ogaden front in southeastern Ethiopia. There are only small battles there now, but it is expected that Italian troops will launch a large-scale attack sooner or later. At the same time, the mobilization near Harar is almost complete. This place is the target of the Italian army's attack from Somalia. It is heard that the monthly salaries of Ethiopian soldiers are now doubled than usual. By the end of the week, there will be no major battles. The Italian army has built a road to Addis Ababa, which is considered a remarkable achievement. General Taibono, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army in East Africa, officially received Aschwa on this new road yesterday. The Italian army is preparing to continue its attack on the one hand, and is engaged in propaganda among the tribes of Ethiopia on the other hand. Ethiopians all know the danger of Italy's "golden propaganda," because it is rumored in Addis Ababa that seven Somali leaders were found by the Italian army to have a large number of Italian coins hidden and were shot as spies. The Italian side has spread the news of Ethiopian troops fleeing and surrendering to the Italian army, while it is also rumored in Addis Ababa that the Somali leader Samatari has led 2,000 people to surrender to the Ethiopian army. It is also said that Somali soldiers are now fleeing from the Italian army every day. Harar is the location of the main camp of the southern Ethiopian army, and the arrangements for defending the skies against attack have been greatly strengthened. Many anti-aircraft guns are placed on small surrounding hills that are not easily detected. The Ethiopian authorities have denied the claim that the Italian vanguard has reached a certain location only 60 miles from Harar. (11th dispatch from Reuters)</p>

Police were also guarding the Italian embassy in London, but there were no demonstrations in front of the embassy. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Aloisi Addresses American Public Via Radio Broadcast, Defends Italian Policy</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Italian representative Aloisi recently delivered a radio broadcast here to the American people, explaining Italy's view of the Italian-Abyssinian conflict, counting the following items: (1) The League of Nations has treated Italy unfairly; (2) Italy does not recognize Abyssinia as a unified country. Abyssinia can actually be divided into the area directly under the central government and the vassal part, whose subjects are subjected to various inhumane rule; (3) When Italy voted in 1922 to approve Abyssinia's accession to the League of Nations, this situation in Abyssinia already existed, but at that time, Abyssinia's accession to the League of Nations had various conditions attached, which have not been fulfilled since then; (4) Italy's actions do not violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact, as the Kellogg-Briand Pact allows countries to fight for self-defense, and in the past ten years, there have been as many as ninety incidents on the border between Abyssinia and Italian colonies; (5) Italy's interests in Abyssinia are related to Italy's survival, which has been repeatedly recognized by treaties signed in 1891, 1894, 1906, and 1925; (6) The League of Nations has adopted a double standard regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, which is tantamount to creating a cocoon to trap itself. Aloisi's conclusion is that to achieve a peaceful solution, it is necessary for (1) the League of Nations to abandon its double standard, and (2) the League of Nations Covenant should be harmonized with current needs.

<h3>Canadian Diplomatic Policy Becomes Election Material for All Parties, Striving to Avoid Being Drawn into the East African War Vortex, Commercial War Against Japan Will Be Intensified</h3>
<p>Ottawa. Canada's diplomatic relations are quite important for tomorrow's election. Diplomatic policy has become campaign material for all parties today. The attitude towards the commercial war against Japan and the East African war has become a matter of discussion. Regarding the Japanese issue, Prime Minister Bennett firmly declared that the Japanese government's imposition of a 50% tariff on Canadian exports aims to force the Canadian government to abandon its adjustment plan. However, the Canadian government believes that changing its policy is tantamount to opening Canada's market and making it vulnerable to foreign aggression. Bennett also said that the Liberal leader's criticism of the government's tariff policy cannot help but encourage Japan's attitude. Regarding the Italian-Abyssinian war, the Canadian government is striving to avoid getting involved. Bennett declared that the Canadian government does not want to get involved in a war that has nothing to do with Canada's interests. However, this statement has conditions attached, namely that if Canada's interests are affected, the government may freely participate in any war with the approval of Parliament. Canada has little interest in this issue between Italy and Abyssinia, but if the war spreads to Europe, it will naturally affect Canada's rights. Liberal leader King and Reconstruction Party leader Stevens both insisted that Canada should not be drawn into the vortex, and should not interfere in foreign affairs without the approval of Parliament.

<h3>Incident of Japanese-Puppet Troops Crossing the Border, Soviet Union Protests to Japan, Border Conflicts Constantly Occurring, Puppet Foreign Ministry Files Counter-Protest</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Russian Ambassador Yurenev personally met with Foreign Minister Hirota this morning and protested about the Manchukuo soldiers firing at Soviet Russian guards three times north of Wuzhan, especially focusing on the incident on October 12 when a Manchukuo sentinel squad swept a detachment of Russian border guards with machine guns. At that time, the Russian soldiers also returned fire. The ambassador did not specify the number of casualties. The "Manchukuo" authorities claimed that it was because the Russian soldiers crossed into the Manchukuo border that they opened fire to drive them back into Russian territory. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Russian Ambassador Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:30 this morning and lodged a protest in writing regarding the new disputes that occurred on October 8 and 12. Moreover, regarding the new disputes that occurred twice in the Suifen River area, he lodged a serious protest based on the Russian investigation, stating that the incidents occurred due to the invasion of the border by the Manchukuo security forces, and proposed that in order to clarify the responsibility for the disputes, a border committee should be organized between Russia, Japan, and "Manchukuo" in accordance with the Russian proposal. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that he only learned about the conflict between the Russian and Manchukuo soldiers after reading the newspaper, but the truth is unknown, so he must consult with "Manchukuo" before he can understand the facts. He also said that the Russian committee proposal will be forwarded to Manchukuo to solicit opinions before a reply can be given. In addition, the disputes occurred due to the uncertainty of the border line, so he insisted that it is necessary to determine the border line in order to resolve the issue. The Russian ambassador also considered this for a long time before leaving at noon. (Denstu dispatch, 14th) The "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed the Harbin Special Envoy to protest to the Soviet Consul General on the 14th, conveying the government's message, due to the fact that Soviet border guards crossed the eastern border, resulting in incidents. (Japan United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The antagonism between Japan and Russia seems to be increasing today. Yesterday, the Soviet Russian government formally announced the conflict between the soldiers of the two countries on the Songhua River. According to the report of the headquarters of the Soviet Russian Far East Army in Khabarovsk, fifty Japanese-Manchukuo soldiers crossed the river in the Grodekovo area on Saturday, using smoke screens as cover, and repelled twenty Russian guards with rifles and machine guns. The Ministry of the Army has studied this telegram today, and the report also stated that both sides suffered casualties. There have been conflicts before. Yurenev, the Soviet Russian ambassador to Japan, has been ordered to protest to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, and it is expected that he will personally visit Foreign Minister Hirota on Monday. It is reported that the Russian envoy will construct a mixed committee to determine the responsibility for the conflicts that have occurred over the past few months. Both the Soviet Russian Foreign Ministry and the Japanese Embassy issued statements today, claiming that there is no danger of war. However, Soviet Russian officials privately expressed concern that the Japanese Kwantung Army may disregard the government and act arbitrarily, hoping to take advantage of the world's eventful autumn to expand its territory in northern Asia. The Soviet Russian side believes that the Japanese army has long had the ambition to occupy the coastal provinces of Siberia, and the Japanese military has always called this area "a sharp arrow directly aimed at the heart of Japan." The statement issued by the Soviet Russian government today is roughly as follows: (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>The Truth of the Incident, Russia and Japan Have Different Views</h3>
<p>On the 6th of this month, in the Grodekovo area, a Soviet border patrol (including two mounted guards) was attacked by Manchukuo troops who invaded Soviet territory three kilometers from the border. The Manchukuo troops, numbering about twenty, were commanded by a Japanese officer. They opened fire on the Soviet mounted guards.</p>
<p>On the 8th of this month, about fifty Japanese-Manchukuo troops were found in the same location in Soviet territory. The Soviet government strongly protested to the Japanese-Manchukuo governments for the invasion of Soviet territory by the Japanese-Manchukuo troops. Unexpectedly, on</p>
<p>The 12th of this month, at 4:05 p.m. (Khabarovsk time), about fifty troops again invaded Soviet territory near the location where the incidents occurred on the 6th and 8th. They advanced about one kilometer into Soviet territory and opened fire on the Soviet patrol (including two mounted guards). Another two teams of Soviet patrols, with eighteen soldiers, were about two and a half kilometers away from the Japanese-Manchukuo troops and immediately rushed to rescue the first patrol team. The Japanese-Manchukuo troops fired rifles and machine guns at the Soviet patrol teams. In order to facilitate their advance, they set fire to dry grass. They took advantage of the smoke to advance towards the Soviet patrol teams. As a result of the firing, several Soviet border guards were killed or wounded, and the same was true for the Japanese-Manchukuo side.</p>
<p>After receiving the news of this border intrusion, the Soviet government immediately instructed its ambassador to Japan to lodge a strong protest, and at the same time suggested establishing a mixed committee to investigate the truth of the matter. (TASS dispatch, Moscow, 13th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Army released the following details of the conflict between the Russian and Manchukuo troops on the afternoon of the 14th:</p>
<p>On October 6, a conflict occurred between Soviet and Manchukuo troops. On October 12 at 3:00 p.m., the army dispatched an investigation team consisting of Sergeant Major Nemoto of the Kenpeitai (military police) and two Manchukuo officers related to the conflict to investigate the truth on the ground, and "dispatched the Manchukuo" Border Surveillance Team of thirty-two people to escort them. When the group was establishing a marker at the location of the incident twenty kilometers north of the Suifen River, suddenly fifty Russian soldiers began firing with five heavy machine guns, but did not issue any warning to the investigation team beforehand. The Japanese-Manchukuo investigation team had no choice but to fight back. In this battle, one Japanese military police officer, one leader, and four Manchukuo soldiers were killed. Five more Manchukuo soldiers were injured. The director of the Suifen River Special Agency has dispatched Captain Nakamura of the garrison unit to the site to conduct an investigation. (Japan United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the border conflict between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo, the Soviet Foreign Ministry notified the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union on the 13th that the nature of this matter cannot be the cause of a war between Japan and the Soviet Union. Also, the Japanese Embassy authorities pointed out the errors made by the Soviet Union, saying that although there are reports of Japanese and Manchukuo troops attacking the Soviet patrol, the Japanese government has denied it.

<h3>Kwantung Army Indignant, Conferring on Countermeasures</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The circumstances of the recent conflict on the Russian-Manchukuo border released by the Japanese side are quite different from those described by the Soviet Russian side. All sectors of the Japanese community here believe that the Soviet Russian authorities are deliberately trying to create a serious incident, and they expect that if such incidents occur again in the future, they will deal with them with severe action. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Army held a meeting of its top leaders this morning to discuss countermeasures. As for the root cause of the dispute, it is due to the uncertainty of the border line and the lack of sincerity of Soviet Russia. Therefore, a decisive attitude will be adopted towards the incident.

Moreover, regarding only qualitative disarmament, Japan has no choice but to oppose making this qualitative issue the subject of the disarmament conference because there is no possibility of substantive disarmament.

<h3>The Course of the Smuggling Issue in Chaozhou and Shantou, Seven Japanese Ships Still Stationed in Shantou, National Day Parade Therefore Suspended</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: During this year's Double Ten Festival, celebrations and military parades were held in various parts of Guangdong Province. In Shantou, the event was held at the Qilu airfield, with Li Hanhun as the reviewing officer and Luo Xianxiang as the commander. In Chao'an, the event was held at the West Lake Sports Ground, with Deng Longguang as the reviewing officer. In Meixian, the event was held at the East Drill Ground, with Huang Renhuan as the reviewing officer. In Xingning, the event was held at the Fangba Dam, with Tan Langxing as the reviewing officer. In Xunwu, the event was held at the Sanbiao market, with Zhang Ruigui as the reviewing officer. The garrisons in Jieyang, Fengshun, Dapu, and Raoping counties also held similar events. Boy scouts, militia, and regular troops from various schools all participated in the parade. However, the Shantou Preparatory Committee also planned to imitate the Guangzhou carnival and prepared for a scene-setting event, lion dances, dragon welcomes, fish lantern races, gongs and drums, horse scenes, paper scenes, human scenes, etc. All the expenses were specially collected from shops and residents, and were paid for by collecting taxes from various merchants. The amount was originally not small, and the preparations were ready, but unexpectedly the smuggling issue occurred? Japanese warships arrived in Shantou and demanded the release of people and goods, compensation for losses, and a guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future. They also declared that the fleet would not leave Shantou unless a satisfactory answer was given. Therefore, in order to avoid disputes, the authorities specially ordered the suspension of the parade on the 8th, and the grand event that was being prepared was virtually eliminated. However, at 8:30 AM on the 10th, representatives from various groups in Shantou, government officials, and military police students participating in the parade still gathered at the airfield, totaling more than 5,000 people. At 10:00 AM, cannons were fired to open the meeting. Li Hanhun, Li Yuanhe, and others went to the rostrum to perform the opening ceremony and gave brief speeches, and then the meeting was dismissed. This shows the current environment in Shantou.</p>
<p>The so-called smuggling issue is extremely complicated. Since Guangdong Province began collecting taxes on agricultural products, the taxes on oil, rice, beans, bean cakes, etc. have been particularly heavy. Japanese merchants do not recognize local taxes and have repeatedly transported large amounts of rice, oil, and beans from foreign ports. After declaring taxes at customs, they transport the goods to foreign firms' warehouses and hand them over to inland merchants for sale. The foreign firms guarantee the goods to the store and then pay the silver. If there is a loss due to detention or seizure after reaching the store, it is still the responsibility of the foreign firm. The foreign firms claim that the goods are consigned. Since this trend began, Chinese commercial firms, such as north-south firms and grain firms, have suffered a major blow. The Miansu Chang, opened by Cai Shifan, chairman of the north-south firms, was also affected and closed down. Currently, nearly 90% of them are closed. This is because each bag of rice has to pay more than four yuan in special tax, Shantou has to pay 5.4 yuan per 100 catties, soybeans have to pay 1.8 yuan per 100 catties, and other items such as old newspapers and seafood are all imported in large quantities by foreign firms. The cost of Chinese merchants' goods is high, so they naturally cannot compete with them. The Chaozhou-Shantou Chamber of Commerce and various guilds telegraphed the government two months ago requesting relief and asking to stop collecting various special taxes, special taxes, surcharges, etc., but the government rejected the request because the tax revenue is related to military salaries, which amount to 10 to 20 million yuan each year. Later, a strict method was devised: when Chinese merchants import oil, rice, and beans that have already paid taxes to the Agricultural Products Bureau, they must obtain a transportation permit from the tax bureau when selling them. This permit must be carried with the goods and presented to customs checkpoints along the way for inspection and release, and an inspection stamp must be obtained. With these two documents, the goods can be transported and sold inland; otherwise, they will be confiscated and punished. Although these procedures are troublesome, they are a new way to crack down on smuggled goods. On the 8th of last month, the Eastern District Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of responsible persons from military, political, police, tax, and anti-smuggling agencies and decided to work together to maintain tax revenue. At the same time, they telegraphed the county magistrates to cooperate in anti-smuggling. The counties also notified the district chiefs, township chiefs, autonomous regions, police teams, public security bureaus, and police stations to cooperate in the investigation. The anti-smuggling soldiers are responsible for the execution. On the 10th and 11th of last month, Jieyang County Magistrate Huang Bingxun sent police to search for smuggled goods. In Yanhefa outside the West Gate, 20 bags of black beans and 50 bags of soybeans were found. In Yongxinglong outside the North Gate, 110 bags of foreign rice were found. On the Beixi River surface, a five-bellied boat was found with 25 bags of foreign rice, 105 bags of green soybeans, and 80 barrels of soybean oil. Since the above shops did not have transfer slips and along-the-way inspection certificates, the police soldiers considered them smuggled goods and arrested many people related to the smuggled goods. According to the boat manager Zhang Zhenshu, the goods were transported by people from Qianjinhu in the 8th district of Puning and belonged to Youli, Daoli, Quanli, Yuda, Houfeng and other shops in Hepo market, and were entrusted to Zhang Quanchang from Jieyang to import them in Shantou. Based on this, County Magistrate Huang detained the relevant people. On the 12th, he convened many people, such as workers from the Civilian Boat Labor Union, and representatives from the Oil, Bean, and Oil Industry Guild, at the County Chamber of Commerce, instructing the Chamber of Commerce to notify all merchants to understand the righteousness, and all workers to love the country. If smuggling is encountered, they must not be greedy for money. Once it is discovered, they will be punished according to law. This case has provoked Japanese intervention. Seven Japanese warships have sailed into Shantou under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese, and Japanese sailors have landed on the shore. This incident is getting more and more serious. Guangzhou and Nanjing both believe that the Chaozhou-Shantou issue is a companion, and the Japanese also believe that Chaozhou-Shantou is their common opponent. However, Jieyang is not within the Shantou municipal area, and Mayor Li Yuanhe has no power to investigate. The Eastern District Commissioner's Office does not have any negotiators, so Guangzhou will send another senior official to Shantou to be responsible for handling this case. It is reported that Gan Jiehou, Wu Bosheng, and Liang Zhihuai will arrive in Shantou during the day. The headquarters has also sent Li Jingxi, the head of the military law office, to Shantou to investigate and try the relevant criminals in the case. How this case will be resolved is currently unclear. (11th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Economic Study Mission Arrives in Tokyo via Nagasaki, Hirota Hopes for Mutual Sincerity Between the Two Countries, Wu Dingchang Denies Various Reports in Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: The Chinese economic delegation to Japan arrived in Nagasaki at 12:00 noon on the 7th aboard the Shanghai Maru. The governor of Nagasaki Prefecture, the mayor, and our consul Liu stationed there were all waiting at the shore in advance. With the permission of the Ministry of the Navy, they accompanied the delegation to visit the Mitsubishi Shipyard after their arrival. Wu Dingchang, the head of the delegation, issued a written statement explaining the delegation's mission (original text follows). After a short stay, they set sail from Nagasaki at 5:00 PM. They arrived in Kobe at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. The mayor of Kobe specially hung the Chinese flag on Mount Anchor to express his welcome. Many Chinese and Japanese officials and businessmen welcomed them on the shore, creating a grand scene. After disembarking, they were hosted by the local Sino-Japanese Industrial Cooperation Association and a welcome party was held at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Important Chinese and Japanese officials and businessmen in Kobe attended. The mayor, the president of the Sino-Japanese Industrial Cooperation Association, Longchuan, and the president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Okazaki, delivered welcome speeches. Delegation leader Wu Dingchang gave a speech in reply (original text follows). Afterwards, he also issued a written statement (original text follows). Then, at about 8:00 PM, they took a night train east. At 8:00 AM on the morning of the 9th, they arrived at Tokyo Station. Ambassador Chiang and representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Councilor Matsumoto, the president of Yokohama Specie Bank, Toratama, the president of the Bank of Chosen, Kato, the president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Wata Makoto, and more than 100 representatives from Chinese and Japanese circles, including embassy staff, welcomed them at the station. They then went to the Imperial Hotel and stayed there. The head of the delegation also issued a written statement explaining the delegation's mission and his personal feelings (original text follows). At about 9:00 AM, they went to the embassy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Sino-Japanese Industrial Association and other places to pay their respects. In the afternoon, they rested together at the hotel. At 7:00 PM, Ambassador Chiang hosted a banquet at the Imperial Hotel to welcome all the members of the delegation, and invited Foreign Minister Hirota, Minister of Agriculture Yamasaki, Minister of Commerce Machida, and major leaders from the Japanese industrial community to participate. Ambassador Chiang first delivered a speech at the meeting, stating that "Your Excellencies have come to Japan to conduct research, representing various provinces and major cities in China, and have in-depth research on the situation in Japan. This is a rare occasion. In addition to expressing my welcome and admiration, I will do my best to introduce you to various parties here and in Korea, so as to fulfill the meaning of your coming here. At the same time, I hope that people from all walks of life in Japan will provide you with convenience and assistance." Then Wu Dingchang gave a reply (original text follows). Hirota then stood up and gave a speech, saying, "I very much welcome you to our country to conduct research. However, the matters of research are all under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Commerce and Industry and should be spoken by the Minister of Commerce and Industry. But my family was originally a merchant, so I am also interested in commerce. And today's host is a diplomat and a good friend, so I am able to talk with you as the Foreign Minister. It is very pleasant." Then he quoted Confucius, hoping that people from both countries would treat each other with sincerity, which would be fortunate for the future of the relationship between the two countries. Then they talked to each other until about 10 o'clock, and then dispersed in joy. This was the situation on the first day after the delegation arrived in Tokyo. According to a conversation with Wu Dingchang, the head of the delegation, the delegation had not expressed any opinions other than the written statements issued since its departure. The reports in the Japanese newspapers were not true and were fabricated freely. The written statements issued by the delegation are appended below.</p>
<p>Speech Delivered in Nagasaki: Our delegation feels that it is very meaningful to visit Nagasaki, the birthplace of international trade in your country, as the first step on our research trip. Nagasaki is a major trading port closest to our country, and there are many Chinese residents. If time permits, we plan to conduct a more detailed investigation on the way back. Today, due to the short mooring time, we were only able to visit the Mitsubishi Shipyard with the kindness of your country's Maritime Affairs Ministry. As for the mission of our delegation, it is to inspect the prosperous commercial and industrial enterprises of Japan today as a national economic service provider, in order to realize economic cooperation between the two countries. I am fortunate to be able to state the mission of our delegation on this first opportunity to land in Nagasaki, the birthplace of international trade in your country. I sincerely hope that you will appreciate the purpose of our delegation and give your support.</p>
<p>Speech Delivered in Kobe: Our delegation visited Nagasaki, the birthplace of international trade in your country, as the first step of this research trip yesterday. Today, we have arrived in Kobe, the gateway to the industrial center, as the second step, and we feel that we are progressing step by step. Hanshin occupies a thousand seats in your country's industrial zone. In terms of order, we should have inspected it first. I only believe that due to various business negotiations, we decided to go to Tokyo first. Because this inspection of our delegation is not for sightseeing, but has a collaborative mission, we are waiting for the assistance of all parties for the common development of the economies of the two countries.</p>
<p>Speech Delivered upon Arrival in Tokyo: In the past, there have been various study missions from our country to this place, and their purpose was to take Tokyo as the center of their inspection. Therefore, there are many aspects that disturb the local government and the public. However, this is truly worth celebrating in the diplomatic relations between Japan and China. If the people of the two countries have more contact, their mutual understanding can be clarified. Understanding can be sufficient, and this can promote national diplomacy in the true sense of the word and Sino-Japanese friendship. Today, our delegation also has this view, gathers many members, and disturbs your country. The special mission of our delegation, as its name suggests, is economic research. However, the so-called research is not to investigate the advantages of your country's economic circles for the reference of our country's economic circles. It is not a one-sided, selfish meaning. It is to investigate your country's economic circles and our country's economic circles, what good plans should be used to help each other and cooperate to be the foundation of economic cooperation between the two countries. This is the so-called two-sided, mutual meaning. Therefore, during our stay, we plan to meet with knowledgeable people in the government and the public, visit various commercial and industrial facilities, and collect various materials in accordance with this purpose. We sincerely hope that all parties will provide assistance and cooperation. Furthermore, this is my fourth visit. The first time was in 1902, for the purpose of studying abroad. The second time was in 1915, when I was the head of an industrial delegation and led a number of members. I had arrived in Gyeongseong, Korea, but was suddenly advised to stop by your country due to certain special circumstances, so I turned back halfway. The third time was in 1928, when I came as a representative to the Pacific Conference. Each of these visits had different feelings and missions, but this trip is different from the past and I feel a sense of worldly isolation. At the same time, I deeply feel the importance of the mission, just like when I was studying abroad, I came to listen to textbooks, and now I feel that I have come to answer application questions. Whether the answer in the future will be correct or wrong is uncertain.</p>
<p>Speech at the Embassy Banquet: Your Excellency Ambassador Chiang, Your Excellencies, and Gentlemen, I am very grateful to Ambassador Chiang for hosting a grand banquet to introduce distinguished Japanese figures from the government and the public on the evening of the day our delegation arrived in Tokyo. I am especially honored to be able to take this opportunity to express my thoughts on behalf of the delegation to Your Excellencies and Gentlemen. Since the European War, people in Chinese economic circles have deeply known that Japanese commercial and industrial circles have made world-class rapid development, and have especially deeply felt the expansion of the cooperative economic forces among countries in the world. There is an even greater need for economic cooperation between China and Japan. For a long time, we have been thinking of organizing a joint study mission of various industries in various places to visit and inspect Japan's rapidly developing commercial and industrial enterprises, so as to promote economic cooperation between the two countries. The ambition has not been one day, and the sincerity has not been one day. Once this opportunity is obtained, all members of the delegation are happy to celebrate. Originally, economic cooperation between the two countries must hope for the efforts of the governments of the two countries, but how can the people of the two countries give up their responsibilities? They must do their best to promote it. Although the members of our delegation are weak, they are also willing to stand on their shoulders and share some responsibilities. Therefore, we plan to inspect commercial and industrial enterprises on the one hand, exchange economic opinions on the other hand, and plan to conduct continuous research and efforts in the future, so as to inevitably obtain appropriate and feasible concrete plans and complete the great cause of economic cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, I sincerely request the comrades of Japan's government and public to give our delegation convenience, support, and guidance, so that the members of our delegation can bring back the good intentions of Japan's government and public for economic cooperation between the two countries. I respectfully state my humble intentions and express my gratitude in advance. (October 10)</p>
<h3>Japan Electric Communication Company's Economic Observation Group Arrives in Jinan, Departs for Tianjin After One-Day Stay; Group Leader Discusses Purpose of Visit</h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: To commemorate the 30th anniversary of Japan's Electric Communication Company (Denstu), a Chinese economic observation group was specially organized. The group, consisting of 14 members including Mishima Kaiun, arrived in Jinan early on the 13th from Qingdao.伴野韶光, the branch manager of the company's Qingdao branch and concurrently the Jinan branch manager, accompanied them. The Japanese Consul in Jinan, 西田, the military attaché 石野, and leaders of the expatriate community all welcomed them at the station. After disembarking, the group immediately went to the Hejia Hotel to rest. According to group leader Mishima Kaiun, "This time, our group is here to investigate the economy of your country under the auspices of the Electric Communication Company. Besides three members from the Electric Communication Company, there are also eleven others: five from Tokyo, four from Osaka, and one from Nagoya. Among them are 鈴本宇一, the deputy chief of the editorial bureau of the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun, 目畸憲司, a doctor of economics from the general affairs department of the Sumitomo Gomei Kaisha, and the remaining seven are all from the industrial and commercial sectors. The purpose of this trip is that we are not very familiar with the economic situation and rural conditions in various parts of your country, and we hope to conduct a detailed investigation to provide reference for industry and commerce. After arriving in Qingdao, the surface scenery we saw was beautiful and very pleasing to the eye, but upon investigating the inner workings, industry and commerce are still in need of development. The shortage of water in Qingdao greatly affects industry. If the water supply were sufficient, factories would certainly develop further. Shandong's climate is suitable for two harvests a year, while the weather in Northeast Manchuria is cold, and there is only one harvest a year. Therefore, although Shandong is smaller than Manchuria, its production is not small, and its future is very promising. Our country is an industrial country, and China is a raw material country. Not only must China supply raw materials, but the industrial products produced must also be purchased by Chinese farmers. However, unless Chinese agricultural production develops, it cannot supply Japanese industry, and unless the Chinese rural economy recovers, farmers will not be able to afford Japanese goods. Therefore, we very much hope that Chinese agriculture will develop, so that both China and Japan can benefit from it. Japanese industry and commerce are relatively developed, and we very much hope that various circles in China will organize observation groups to visit. The Japanese government and people will sincerely welcome them. As for the issue of investment, it must be Manchuria first and then Shandong. Currently, the order in Manchuria is not yet fully established, and Japanese large capitalists have not yet made large investments. Those who have invested are all small capitalists. In the future, investment in Shandong can only begin after investment in Manchuria is successful," and so on.</p>
<p>The group's itinerary in Jinan: Arrived in Jinan at 7:30 AM on the 13th, rested at the Hejia Hotel, had breakfast at 8:00 AM, visited the Japanese Consul 西田 at 9:00 AM, paid respects to the Japanese War Dead Monument at 10:00 AM, and visited the Japanese military attaché, the Japanese Residents' Association, the Japanese elementary school, Jinan Hospital, the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chinese Jinan Chamber of Commerce, and Jinan Bank. At noon, met with the director of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, banquet by Jinan Bank. At 3:00 PM, toured 城頭馬路, Daming Lake Library, and 廣智院. At 6:30 PM, banquet by the Japanese Consul. On the 14th, at 9:00 AM, lecture by the Japanese military attaché, city tour, at 11:00 AM, visited Chairman 韓 of the provincial government, banquet by Chairman 韓. At 5:00 PM, banquet by the Chinese Jinan Chamber of Commerce, Bankers' Association, Cotton Industry Association, and Grain Industry Association.

<h3>Overview of Economic Decline in Jiangxi Province: Food Imports Exceed 4 Million Yuan; Total Trade Volume Halved in Seven Years</h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Jiangxi Province is an important agricultural region in the Yangtze River basin. Its economic structure is based on agricultural products, mainly rice. During its peak period, annual exports often reached 5 to 6 million yuan. Although it suffered from banditry in 1928, it still reached 1,670,1985 yuan. However, by 1933, it had decreased to over 3 million yuan, and in 1934, it was only over 800,000 yuan. The export figures of other agricultural by-products such as tobacco leaves, peanuts, vegetable oil, eggs, and bamboo and wood have also declined. Most farmers have become hungry vagrants, and imports exceed 4,030,000 yuan, mostly flour and foreign rice. It is strange for an agricultural province to have this phenomenon. Secondly, in terms of Jiangxi's specialty products, in 1928, the export volume of porcelain was 110,484 pieces, ramie cloth was 110,100 pieces, tea was 167,677 dan, and paper was 121,195 dan. However, in 1934, porcelain was only 35,271 pieces, ramie cloth was 5,246 pieces, tea was 87,646 dan, and paper was 49,368 dan. Furthermore, Jiangxi used to have the largest trade surplus due to its abundant agricultural products, prosperous handicrafts, and the frugality of its people. For example, in 1917, it was 14,966,563 yuan, in 1928 it was 15,120,669 yuan, and the surplus was often over one million yuan in other years. After 1931, it turned into a fixed trade deficit. In 1931, it was 215,239,111 yuan, and in 1932 it was 20,510,433 yuan. These figures indicate that Jiangxi has an outflow of 40 million yuan every year. If this continues, it will eventually be drained dry. Furthermore, the total trade volume of Jiangxi Province in 1928 was over 17,768,000 yuan, but last year it was only over 57,708,000 yuan, less than half. From this, it can be seen that the economic circulation power of Jiangxi Province has decreased by half, which is truly alarming.</p>
<h3>Western Henan Highway to be Completed by Deadline; South Lin Highway to be Rerouted Through Yexian</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Communication: In recent years, Henan Province has been actively building highways. National and provincial roads have been progressing rapidly. Road lines in eastern, southern, and northern Henan have long been open to automobile traffic. In the western Henan area, the Luoyang to Luoning section has been completed. However, the Changshui to Lushi and 閿鄉 to Lushi sections have been progressing slowly due to rugged mountain roads and difficult bridge and culvert construction. Since the establishment of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed the provincial government to complete all of the Western Henan Highway by December 15 of this year, as the transportation in the border area between Henan and Shaanxi is of great military importance. However, due to the remote location in the mountains and the difficulty in transporting bridge and culvert materials, Director Zhang Jingyu of the Department of Construction went to Luoyang on the 9th and inspected and urged along the 潼洛 Highway with District Commissioner 歐陽珍 of the Eleventh District, in order to complete the project as soon as possible. The Nanyang Highway runs east through Biyang to Zhumadian, south through Xinye to可達樊, and northeast through Fangcheng, Yexian, and Xuchang, directly to Kaifeng. However, the northwest is mountainous and transportation is inconvenient. The original South Lin Highway, namely Nanyang to Linru, via Nanzhao, Lushan, and Baofeng, was estimated to require 1,520,000 yuan for stone culverts and bridges. It has now been decided to reroute it northwest from Yexian to Linru. In addition to the existing road line between Nanyang and Yexian, 800,000 yuan is enough for the section between Yexian and Linru. It is heard that the plan has been roughly finalized and will be implemented soon. (October 12)</p>
<p>Suspicion of Mailing Morphine Leads to Arrest</p>
<p>Songjiang: Abbot 恆光 of the Ci Yuan Temple at 爱民 Bridge in Songjiang, a native of Sichuan, was recently arrested by the Public Security Bureau under secret orders. A letter from Sichuan was found in the temple. The authorities initially kept the case secret. It is now known that the monk received a letter from a Mr. Liu in Sichuan, stating that he had over one hundred taels of white fungus and would send it to Songjiang in a few days. After receiving it, he was asked to notify a Mr. Wang in Shanghai, who would send someone to Songjiang to pick it up in person. Unexpectedly, the white fungus sent by Mr. Liu was actually morphine. The post office discovered it en route and reported it to the county government for investigation. Today (14th), Investigator Zhang of the county government interrogated the monk, who denied it from beginning to end, and was ordered to be returned to custody for further investigation.</p>
<p>Resolution of National Goods Dispute</p>
<p>Wuxi: The dispute between the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association and local silk, cloth, department store, and other industries has been resolved through the best efforts of party, government, and commercial sectors, and it was decided to conclude it on the 16th. County Magistrate Wang was responsible for persuading, but the association suddenly denied the Chamber of Commerce's mediation, causing the dispute to arise again. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the county government, requesting that the case be investigated and dealt with in accordance with the precedents of Zhenjiang, Huaiyin, and Nantong, and that the association's itinerant vendors who were disguised as auctioneers in Wuxi be expelled to ensure commercial stability. Otherwise, the standing members of the association would have to submit their resignations at the members' meeting on the 15th to allow the various industries to decide for themselves. At the same time, telegrams were sent to the chambers of commerce in Changzhou, Yixing, Jiangyin, Liyang, Zhenjiang, and Nantong counties, urging them to lead the various industries to unite and act in unison, and to request the ministry and province to strictly ban such activities to avoid disruption. On one side, Cheng Jingtang and Xue Mingjian were sent to Shanghai to urge Qian Chengxu, the chairman of the association, to come to Wuxi for further mediation. By 4:00 PM, Qian and others had arrived in Wuxi. After mediation at the County Chamber of Commerce, the association followed the instructions of the party and government mediation and closed its business on the 15th and ended on the 16th. Thus, a national goods auction dispute was completely resolved.</p>
<p>Details of Group of Swindlers on Inland River Steamers</p>
<p>Suzhou: Recently, there have been groups of swindlers posing as sick people and selling fake medicine on inland river steamers such as Suzhou-Wuxi and Suzhou-Changshu. These people make a profit of about one hundred yuan every day. At the same time, the number of victims is unknown. A woman from the Dongjiang 涇乡 village in the Su-Chang border area recently lost her relative so she borrowed 33 silver dollars from relatives to come to Suzhou. They met these people on the steamer, only bought a so-called Tibetan incense for one yuan, but the remaining 32 yuan were stolen by opportunity. They reported to the Changshu Public Security Bureau, which sent a letter to the detective team here. On the night of the 13th, the captain and detectives of the Wu County Detective Team arrested seven people, including 弃永明, at the 大新 Hotel outside the 城門, and seized more than two hundred packages of fake Tibetan incense. After taking the team, they were sent to the Wu County Public Security Bureau on the 14th for interrogation.</p>
<p>Details of Bandit Robbery on Highway Automobile</p>
<p>Pinghu: At 3:28 PM on the National Day, the Jia-Hu intermodal transport vehicle from Zhapu Station to Shanghai was robbed by bandits in the 涇地方 area. The reports in the Shanghai-Hangzhou newspapers vary. It has now been confirmed that the vehicle was No. 61305. When driving to the 57-kilometer mark of Jinshanwei, a bandit wearing a long robe suddenly pulled out a pistol and forced the car to stop. At the same time, three other bandits wearing felt hats also pulled out guns. After the car stopped, another bandit boarded the car, pulled out a large machete from his clothes, broke the tire, and began to search the passengers for more than 2,300 silver dollars. When they left, they fired four shots as a warning. The passengers' luggage was taken away. Helpless, they changed to a return vehicle to Zha. When they got off the bus at the station, everyone was terrified.</p>
<p>Department of Finance Orders Exemption of Harsh Taxes and Levies</p>

<h3>Public Concession Will Soon Conduct Census; Age and Category Must Be Filled in; Authorities Attach Importance to Co-Residence Situation</h3>
<p>The household registration survey of residents in the Public Concession is held every five years as usual. This year is the year to hold the survey. It has now been scheduled to be held on the 23rd of this month. The household registration survey forms will be distributed to each household in the Concession on the morning of the 22nd of this month, and the investigators will collect them from each household on the morning of the 24th. The household registration survey form is printed in four languages: Chinese, English, Japanese, and Russian. However, this year's survey scope is slightly wider than the previous one in 1930. In the first half of this year, the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council decided that in this year's household registration survey form, both Chinese and foreign residents should fill in the age category, and it plans to invite the Shanghai Municipal Government and the French Concession authorities to cooperate and provide coordinated statistical materials, in order to improve the completeness of this year's survey results, and to focus especially on the age category and the population density of each district. The authorities in China and France have now agreed to cooperate. The main points of the new changes in this year's household registration survey form are briefly explained as follows: (1) In the Chinese form, the previous two categories of children and adults have been cancelled and replaced by age categories, which are divided into four items: under five years old, five to fifteen years old, fifteen to twenty years old, and over twenty years old. (2) In the Chinese form, previously, servants were listed separately from other residents in the house. This distinction no longer exists because it is not related to the calculation of each person. The total number of servants can be seen in the occupation item. (3) The Municipal Council attaches great importance to several families living in one house. Therefore, a column for the number of co-residing households has been added to the previous servant item. In addition, there are also types of occupations, etc., which, along with the age category and the number of attached households, etc., are not available in the previous survey form. Furthermore, the English survey form opens with the age category, which is divided into five items. When filling it out, just tick a "×" in the box that your age belongs to, without having to fill in the exact age. The Westerner each wishes to show their actual age. When investigating the population last time, many obstacles occurred, that is why, All the distribution and collection of survey forms are managed by the Police Department of the Municipal Council. In addition, the calculation of foreign people on roads outside the concession is obtained by the method of communication. The number of troops stationed in various countries is also obtained from the commanders of the troops stationed in various countries.</p>

<h3>Telephone Special Committee's Final Report Completed; Submitted to Board of Directors of Municipal Council for Review; Will Be Translated into Chinese and English for Public Release</h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency: The committee composed of Chinese, British, American, and Japanese telephone experts began studying the Shanghai Telephone Company's request to adopt a pay-per-call system and increase telephone charges in August of this year. Two months of work has been completed. After each expert carefully and thoroughly explored the research results based on the opinions provided by all parties during the working period and the factual information collected through consultation, a final report was drafted and submitted to the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council for review. Yesterday morning, a reporter from Dagong News Agency learned that the final report had been completed. The Special Committee held a meeting on the 12th (last Saturday) to make the final corrections and adjustments to the text, and then submitted it to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is scheduled to submit it for discussion at a meeting on the afternoon of the 16th. If there are any questions, it will consult the experts at any time. After the review is completed in the future, the Municipal Council will translate the report into Chinese and English and officially release it to the public.</p>
<h3>Japanese Restrict Chinese People from Going to Dalian; Crack Down on Entry of Laborers, etc.</h3>
<p>Shanghai to Dalian ships, such as the British Taikoo Company and the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company and Nisshin Steamship Company, used to sell tickets to passengers for boarding, regardless of first, second, or third class and steerage. There were no restrictions. Only when it was considered that there was an epidemic would the passengers be tested for feces. There were no other regulations prohibiting entry. The incident of Yingkou prohibiting a large number of Zhilu farmers from entering the country gradually spread to Dalian and Shanghai. The Dalian authorities have also implemented harsh restrictions on Chinese passengers traveling to Dalian by ship from Shanghai, ordering various shipping companies not to sell Dalian tickets indiscriminately. It is investigated that those who are restricted are designated as Chinese laborers, farmers, and small vendors who travel in third-class cabins and steerage who want to go to Guanwai to make a living are not allowed to take ships to Dalian, while passengers in first and second class cabins are not restricted by this ban. Last month, British and Japanese ships carried passengers to Dalian, and the Chinese passengers in steerage were not allowed to enter the country and were returned to Shanghai. Many people have been detained for lack of travel expenses and acquaintances. Therefore, various shipping companies have now strictly cracked down on all Chinese who purchase third-class tickets or steerage tickets, and they must state that they have a job in Dalian before they are allowed to board the ship, otherwise they will be refused to sell tickets.</p>

<h3>Preventing Abuses of False Claims of Poverty: Paupers Cannot be Exempted from Guarantees to Receive Permits; Vagrants are Sent Directly to Hospitals for Treatment; Public Safety Bureau Submits Report to the Municipal Government Based on Discussions</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Special Trades Association of this city stated that due to the large number of poor people in this city and the strict enforcement of opium suppression, most poor people need guarantors to issue certificates when applying for opium suppression permits and filling out certificates. It is difficult to register because of the difficulty in finding a guarantor. If the guarantee for poor people to receive permits is cancelled, the registrants will be very enthusiastic, which is very convenient for the future of opium suppression. The Special Trades Association submitted a document stating the reasons, requesting the municipal government to approve the cancellation of the guarantee for poor people to receive permits. The municipal government specially ordered the Public Safety Bureau to review and reply. According to the provisions of Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the time limit for registering opium users, which states that a certificate must be filled out by the head of the Jia (25 households) and the head of the Bao (100 households) to be eligible for the permit. However, this city has not yet implemented the Baojia system, so poor people are allowed to receive permits. As long as the poor people’s relatives and friends have occupations and addresses, they can be guarantors. Therefore, when the poor people receive the permits, they only need the guarantor to prove and fill out the certificate, and they can be allowed to issue the permit. Since its implementation, the number of registrants has been dominated by poor people and there is no obstruction. Because no matter how poor a person is, it is unlikely that there is no one they know in the whole city. If they are vagrants and beggars, they have no fixed residence and no fixed occupation, so it is difficult to find a guarantor. Therefore, the Public Safety Bureau specifically exempts these poor people from guarantee and sends them directly to the opium suppression hospital for treatment. According to the original regulations, restricting the poor to receive permits requires a guarantee to prevent opium users from buying and claiming to be poor to receive permits. If no one proves, then all opium users can claim to be poor to receive permits, which will cause great abuses and unimaginable consequences. Therefore, the request of the Special Trades Association to cancel the guarantee is difficult to handle. The Public Safety Bureau has now submitted the detailed situation to the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Central Government Promulgates Industrial Laws and Regulations; Meeting to be Held Tomorrow to Discuss Implementation</h3>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, the United Association of Chinese National Goods Factories in this city, the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, the National Goods Manufacturers Association, and other groups believe that the organizations of national goods groups do not have separate laws and regulations, resulting in scattered organizations and inconsistent actions. The future of national goods has been greatly affected. After several meetings, they requested the central government to promulgate separate laws and regulations for the organization of national goods groups and industrial laws and regulations to improve the organization of national goods groups. Because the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is about to be held, in order to prepare for sending representatives to petition the conference and request the Legislative Yuan to promulgate laws and regulations, it is now scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 16th) in the Machine Federation Association on Ningbo Road. All groups have been notified to send representatives to attend and discuss the progress.</p>
<h3>Cotton: Provisional Business Tax Collection Method; Jiangsu Provincial Government Notifies Cotton Mills; Regulations Stipulate Collection from Sellers</h3>
<p>The Chinese cotton mills submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department for correction because the business tax bureaus of various counties in Jiangsu Province still require the collection of business tax after verifying the passports when new cotton is put on the market this autumn, and will not release it. Now, the department has sent a telegram to notify the cotton mills and ordered all bureaus and offices in the province that the provisional business tax on cotton is stipulated to be collected from the seller. Each bureau and office should send personnel directly to the seller to collect taxes. For the cotton purchased by the cotton mills at the cotton purchasing locations that have been approved by the department, the passports should be filled out at any time after verification for transportation, and no obstruction should be made. Zhao Dihua, Director of the Department, said. Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1260. It is found that the Shaanxi-Rongzhou route planned by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation has been opened on the 25th of last month. Notice Nos. 1254 and 1256 have been issued to inform the public. It is found that the Hanzhong Airport is too small and will not be open to traffic for the time being. A station will be set up after it is expanded in the future. It is necessary to notify the public for knowledge. This notice is issued by Postmaster Zha Peilin on October 8, the 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Salt Affairs Audit Office: Completion of Salt Mounds Construction in Huaibei; Construction of Jiangnan Along the River Has Now Started; Sailboat Workers’ Unemployment is Being Planned for Relief</h3>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, in order to increase salt production in the salt areas, the General Office of Salt Affairs Audit of the Ministry of Finance is building salt mounds on both banks of the Huaibei and Jiangnan along the river. The north bank has been completed, and the construction of the south bank has begun. After the transportation was changed to wheel transportation, more than 10,000 sailboat workers were unemployed. The Ministry of Finance plans to provide relief. Yesterday, Director of the Audit Office Zhu Tingqi gave a detailed account of the process to the reporter of the Da Gong News Agency, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Huaibei Completed, Jiangnan Started. The two Huai Rivers and other places bordering Jiangsu and Anhui provinces in my country are famous salt producing areas. The annual output value reaches several million, but the loss of production is very large due to poor refining. Therefore, in order to increase national income, the Salt Affairs Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance is building several salt mounds on both banks of the Huai River to produce and manufacture salt at any time. The north bank has been completed and the construction of the south bank has begun, which is expected to be completed this year.</p>
<p>Sailboat Workers’ Unemployment, Seeking Relief. Regarding the transportation and sale of salt produced in the salt area to the market, the use of sailboats will delay the voyage time, which will affect the economic time of the salt workers. Therefore, it is changed to wheel transportation. As a result, tens of thousands of sailboat workers who depend on this over-production are suddenly unemployed. The Salt Office once advocated building a hemp bag factory to try to accommodate them. However, the number of people is too large and they are new to the work, making it difficult to realize. The sailboat workers have repeatedly petitioned the central government for relief, but a concrete solution has not yet been reached. The Ministry of Finance is now deliberating on a proper relief plan so that the sailboat workers can have a way out in life.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Instructions on Doubts about Stamp Tax Application</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Zhenfeng Electrical Manufacturing Factory yesterday, instructing on five points of doubt about stamp tax application: On the 12th of this month, we received your letter inquiring about five points regarding stamp tax. Our reply is as follows: (1) Because of the difficulties for the consignee to affix the stamp tax on the goods receipt, it is proposed to change to a delivery book, with each book affixed with 2 jiao. This matter has already been reported to the Ministry of Finance by our association, but it has not been approved. (2) In commercial transactions that do not use cash, but are paid at the end of the month according to custom, and a detailed account of the product name, quantity, and price is issued to the customer before the deadline, this is the bill for payment mentioned in Article 16, Section 3 of the Stamp Tax Law and should be affixed with a stamp tax according to the regulations in the tax rate table. (3) The workers' work booklets issued to workers, if the workers use them to withdraw wages, do not need to be affixed with stamp tax according to the provisions in the tax exemption column of Article 16, Section 4 of the Stamp Tax Law. (4) The workers' workbooks used in factories cannot be exempted from stamp tax by analogy with the workers' work booklets for withdrawing money, and there has been a ministry approval. (5) According to the interpretation of the Ministry of Finance, documents are divided into internal use and external use, while account books are used for internal audit and there is no distinction between internal and external. Therefore, all account books related to business should be affixed with stamp tax and cannot be excused as internal use and exempted. According to the above reasons, the material inquiry account book should be affixed with stamp tax, etc.</p>
<h3>Wusong Rent Reduction Dispute Resolved; Ren Changhe Property Reduced by 20% Across the Board</h3>
<p>The city houses in the Baima Road East Section Ferry Terminal area of Wusong are owned by Ren Changhe Company. The monthly rent is more than 20 yuan. Recently, due to the sluggish market, the impact has spread to Wusong City and business has been unusually quiet. The tenants there, Xie Xing Shun Brick and Tile Shop, Mingyuan Tea House, Zhongxin Hotel, Changji Timber Shop, Jiang Gongxing Customs Broker, etc., jointly submitted a request to various party, government, and police agencies this spring, requesting Ren Changhe to reduce the rent. Because the landlord did not agree, it has been brewing for half a year. The Eighth District Party Department of Wusong, considering the decline in business in Wusong City and the need to resolve the rent reduction dispute, convened both parties yesterday at the District Party Department for a meeting. Representatives of the landlord, Zhao Weixuan, and the heads of the tenants and the District Party Department, Wang Chenge, etc., attended the meeting. The results of the meeting were: (1) All future rents will be reduced by 20% (Ren Changhe property). (2) The rent owed by the tenants will be paid off in two installments. (3) After the rent reduction, the tenants must not be in arrears again. After the decision, both parties expressed satisfaction and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Summary of Activities of Various Charity Organizations</h3>
<p>The Fundraising Division of the China Huayang Joint Famine Relief and Disaster Relief General Association has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life since the fundraising for the Jianghe flood disaster began. Mrs. Wang Zhengxu, Chairman of the Shanghai Women's Association, and members of the association have always been enthusiastic about public welfare. In view of the severe flood this year, they launched a fundraising campaign and raised 960 yuan in just a few days. Feeling that this was not enough, they held a tea dance party at the Paramount Hotel. The ticket sales revenue, after deducting necessary expenses, had a net surplus of 2,056 yuan, which, together with the donations, totaled 3,016 yuan. The full amount was submitted to the Fundraising Division for disaster relief. In addition, the Chinese Red Cross Society allocated 40,000 yuan for disaster relief to the General Association for distribution to Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangsu provinces, each receiving one-fourth. They have been received and remitted to the branches of the General Association in Shandong, Hubei, and Hunan provinces for distribution. The disaster relief funds for Jiangsu province are directly remitted to the disaster area. It is reported that the Red Cross Society will continue to allocate flour, clothing, medicine, etc. to the General Association for distribution to the above-mentioned four provinces.</p>
<p>The Huayang Joint Famine Relief Association believes that although the Yangtze River has receded, disaster relief should be carried out actively. However, the disaster area is too large and the resources are limited. Except for Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces that have jointly handled the matter with the Red Swastika Society, Hubei, the gateway to disaster, has suffered the most severely. The association first sent a special commissioner to cooperate with the Jisheng Society. According to the report of the commissioner Zheng Shouchuan after his departure, which is excerpted as follows: He arrived in Wuhan on the 6th and transferred to a small steamer to reach Tianmen County, a winding waterway of 360 li. Along the way, there were many breaches on both banks, and the area behind the embankment was a vast expanse of water. Most of the victims were temporarily living in straw sheds or small boats. The various tragic situations are difficult to describe in detail. The county is divided into eight districts, and the most severely affected are the first, fifth, and eighth districts, followed by the second and fourth districts, and then the third, sixth, and seventh districts. This joint release is aimed at the first, fifth, and eighth districts. However, the first and eighth districts have been surveyed and released by Daoist Hou and his colleagues from the Jisheng Society, and most of them have been completed. Shouchuan has set off to survey the fifth district. The disaster area of the county is more than 6,300 square li, accounting for about nine-tenths of the county. It is estimated that about 1.5 million mu of farmland have been flooded. The loss of damaged houses, property, and livestock is no less than 245 million yuan. The total population of the county is more than 800,000, and more than 600,000 people have been affected. The number of people who drowned is estimated at 12,000. Although the water has receded, there are still one or two feet of water in the low-lying areas. Looking at the vastness of the disaster area and the cause of the disaster, it seems difficult to solve the problem with the amount of disaster relief. It is difficult to estimate the number of people without food, clothing, or homes. In the blink of an eye, autumn is over and winter is coming. The plight of hunger and cold is so tragic that it is unbearable to imagine.</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society believes that the flood in Tianmen, Hubei is severe, and the society has cooperated with Huayang Joint Famine Relief to remit 9,000 yuan for disaster relief and 2,000 yuan raised by Hou Yongde, the abbot of the Changchun Temple in Wuchang, totaling 12,000 yuan, all of which were used to purchase soybeans and rice for distribution, as reported in the previous newspaper. Recently, the association received a letter from Hou Yongde, the director of disaster relief in Tianmen, stating that the villagers in the Yuxin River area of the eighth district posted notices on the 30th, stating that the distribution would be held from October 1 to 5. The distribution locations were divided into two places, one at the Futaiyuan Rice Shop in Dongguan and the other at the District Office of the Eighth District. In total, 1,036 bean and rice disaster relief tickets were collected in five days, including 5,741 large tickets and 2,715 small tickets, with a total of 70 shi, 0 dou, 9 sheng, and 8.5 ge of rice and beans distributed. However, there was a lot of loss of beans and rice, and the actual distribution was 73 shi, 4 dou, and 9 ri of rice and 77 bai, 6 dou, and 9 sheng of broad beans. The fifth district (i.e., the Ganziyi area) dispatched Daoist Liu Xingben and others to investigate on the 6th. It was found that the Yuxin River area in the eighth district is relatively high, and the autumn crops planted can withstand drought and the seedlings are also lush. It is expected to mature around October 20. The buckwheat has also been moistened by the heavy rain on September 30, and a good harvest is expected next year. The people in the district have no worries about food. The first district is slightly lower and has suffered another flood, resulting in a loss of most of the autumn harvest. The fifth district has a history of low land and no harvest at all. Hanchuan is located to the east of Damenchen County and borders the fifth district. The terrain is even lower and is still a vast ocean. The disaster is no less severe than that of Tianmen. However, it is slightly further away from the breach, and people were able to relocate after the breach, resulting in fewer deaths. Most of the people in Tianmen City live by manual weaving, but at present, the Baiye industry is depressed and life is hopeless. The rice and beans distributed this time are just a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. It is hoped that all the philanthropists will call for donations to provide a continuous supply of disaster relief food and drink.</p>
<h3>Wei Tong He Ji Factory: The Entire Staff Reduces Food Consumption for One Day to Help Disaster Relief</h3>

<h3>Guangdong Bank: Creditors Held a Talk Yesterday; Three Groups from the Kwong Siu Association Form a Debt Collection Group; Written Opinions Solicited for Further Discussion at a Meeting</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, since the Guangdong Bank ceased operations, creditors of the Shanghai branch have registered with the Kwong Siu Association, the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association, the Yue Qiao Commercial Federation, and other three groups, requesting them to preside over everything. The three groups specially convened a talk with the creditors of the Guangdong Bank at the Kwong Siu Association on Ningbo Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. Wen Qinfu of the Kwong Siu Association, Jiang Tianduo of the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association, Chen Bingqian of the Yue Qiao Commercial Federation, and more than 100 creditors including Tang Haian attended the meeting. Chen Bingqian, who was elected as chairman, reported briefly that since the Yue Qiao and other three groups have been handling the registration of creditors of the Guangdong Bank, as of the 13th of this month, a total of 732,456 yuan, 7 jiao, and 8 fen have been registered. As of the 14th, a total of 75,721 yuan and 8 jiao and 1 fen have been registered, totaling 800,08,178 yuan and 5 jiao and 9 fen. Among them, fixed deposits accounted for about 420,000 yuan, current deposits accounted for about 185,000 yuan, and transactions and drafts accounted for about 203,000 yuan. Today's talk with the creditors is to solicit opinions from the creditors in order to proceed. After the chairman's report, the creditors expressed many opinions, which were roughly divided into (1) supporting the resumption of business by the Guangdong Bank, with three-quarters or half of the deposits used as capital. The Guangdong Bank currently has assets of more than 22 million yuan and liabilities of more than 14 million yuan. According to the current value of the industry, only more than 8 million yuan can be used to offset the arrears, resulting in considerable losses. (2) Opposing the use of deposits as capital, hoping to implement liquidation and return the arrears. After the chairman summarized the opinions of everyone, a unanimous resolution was reached: (1) The Kwong Siu Association and other three groups are also one of the creditors and should form a debt collection group with the creditors to proceed together. (2) Send letters to each creditor soliciting written opinions on the two items of liquidation and resumption of business, and then hold a meeting to vote. The meeting ended at about 6:00 PM.</p>

A tram No. 48 on Route 10 of the French Commercial Tram Company, driven by Xu Muqing, was turning east, traveling south. At the same time, a cargo truck No. 6038 (British Concession Permit) 1195 (French Concession Permit) driven by Peng Taoyuan from Tongzhou, (belonging to Peng Guiji, a transporter at No. 19 Maktout Road, Dixi'en Road, Hongkou) was also turning east in the same direction as the tram.

Attorney Yuan Jiahan from the Police Department explained the case, and filed a public prosecution according to Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code for causing death due to professional negligence. The victim's father, Shu Xinggeng (45 years old, a businessman in his hometown who came to Shanghai after receiving the news), also hired lawyer Sun Zuji to file a private prosecution. He calculated the loss based on the deceased's potential earnings of thirty yuan per month until the age of 60, assuming he would serve society until the age of 60, amounting to 35 years and a total of 12,600 yuan, plus funeral expenses of 386.5 yuan. He requested that the court order the defendant Peng Taoyuan and the owner of the truck, Peng Guiji, to pay the compensation.

However, witnesses Xu Yuexiao, the tram driver from the tram company, and Luo Zifan, the ticket seller, testified that the tram was in front and the truck was behind, and that the truck caused the accident. Furthermore, the victim shouted that he was hit by the truck after being struck. The court also summoned witnesses Li Xueyi, Han Zhongtao, Chen Zigen, and Chen Ayu, who were truck workers, and questioned them separately. Their testimonies were the same as the defendant's. The court decided to adjourn the hearing to the 18th for further inquiry. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau to Establish Police Museum: Displaying Various Weapons, Drugs, Counterfeit Currency, and Other Items</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that Cai Jinjun, Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, in order to clarify all the weapons used in theft and robbery and to ensure that the police have the necessary knowledge for identification and strict prevention, has established a police "museum" in the left-side stable of the bureau. The Municipal Government has approved the allocation of funds for this project. However, due to limited financial resources, it is not possible to fully equip the museum. Therefore, the bureau is temporarily collecting various weapons used by thieves and other illegal items from the confiscated evidence of the First Special District Court, the Second Special District Court, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Security Department, and the Third Section of the bureau. These items will be numbered and displayed in glass display cases. The police commissioner is responsible for managing the museum. A report of the reporter’s visit to the museum yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Thieves' Weapons: Various genuine and fake firearms, pliers, iron rulers, iron bars, iron hammers, sharp knives of various sizes, iron hooks, rope ladders, long and short iron drills, and other iron tools are too numerous to mention. All items are numbered and placed in glass display cases for identification.</p>
<p>Highly Toxic Drugs: There are also highly toxic drugs from confiscated evidence from various agencies, such as large and small red pills, heroin, morphine, and opium dross. There are also various models of equipment for manufacturing red pills, heroin, and morphine, such as iron sieves, in various shapes and colors.</p>
<p>Counterfeit Currency Models: As for the counterfeit currency display, there are counterfeit banknotes of ten yuan and five yuan denominations from various banks in China, such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of Central and South China. The colors are bright, and the manufacturing is exquisite, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake. There are also many models of counterfeit banknotes from various banks, as well as substandard overseas Chinese silver coins and models of their manufacturing.</p>
<p>Detective Research: Of particular note are two glass panes, each with three bullet holes. These allow detectives to use scientific methods to study and determine the order of firing (first shot, second shot, third shot) on each pane of glass, as well as other studies of assumed criminal footprints. By measuring the size and length of the footprints, the height and build of the perpetrator can be estimated.</p>
<p>Crime Identification: A map is hung in the museum, showing the locations of various crimes committed within the municipality, marked with different symbols. This allows viewers to see at a glance which areas have the highest number of kidnapping cases, robbery cases, theft cases, and drug cases, allowing the relevant sub-bureaus or police stations to be instructed to strengthen their vigilance and take strict precautions.</p>
<p>Official Police Uniforms: There are also two models of the uniforms worn by the bureau's officials and police officers, dressed in full attire, with shoulder straps, leather shoes, hat styles, and waist belts, arranged in a rectangular glass case.</p>

<h3>Death in Bathhouse Over a Bar of Soap: Rubdown Turns Fatal; Suspect Liu Fulong Prosecuted</h3>
<p>Shi Yuancai, a 44-year-old masseur from Yangzhou at the Qingquan Bathhouse at 516 Avenue Edward VII, and Liu Fulong, 26 years old, had a dispute over a bar of soap at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. The dispute escalated into a physical altercation, resulting in Shi being injured in the waist. Another companion, Qian Laosan, took Shi to the Yongfa Warehouse in the French Concession to rest. At 11:00 PM, his condition worsened, and Qian transported him to Renji Hospital, where he died despite treatment. The hospital reported the death to the Laozha Police Station, which dispatched detective Chen Ruisheng to investigate. Liu was arrested and taken to the police station for detention. The body was taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Avenue Foch. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and court clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. According to the report of Chinese police chief Lu Dagong, Liu Fulong had already been sent to the court and a postponement had been approved. Zhang Wancai, 30 years old, who also worked as a masseur at the bathhouse, reported that Liu was giving a rubdown to a customer who had brought his own bar of soap. Shi took the soap to use, which displeased the customer. Liu then asked Shi to return the soap, but Shi refused, leading to the dispute. He saw Shi push Liu first, and Liu retaliated with a punch to his waist. After being separated, Shi was still able to continue working. When questioned, Liu Fulong admitted to the physical altercation. Guo concluded that the deceased, Shi Yuancai, male, died of a ruptured spleen caused by the injury. The suspect, Liu Fulong, should be prosecuted by the police according to law and sent to the court for review. The body was handed over to Pushan Cemetery for burial.</p>
<h3>Another Confiscation of Illegally Exported Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance of the National Government promulgated the temporary regulations prohibiting the export of silver on July 15th of this year, Customs inspectors have repeatedly seized cases of smuggling. The amounts range from two or three hundred yuan to as little as several tens of yuan. The perpetrators have been sentenced to imprisonment for three or four years or one or two years by the local court. Yesterday, Customs inspectors on a foreign warship (bound for Hong Kong) in Wusong discovered that Tan Shiquan (26 years old, from Guangdong) was carrying a large sum of silver dollars, totaling 2,700 yuan (Tan was selling groceries on the ship), with the intention of smuggling them out for profit. The Customs inspectors notified the Water Police Station, who sent police to board the ship and arrest Tan for interrogation at the local court. The 2,700 silver dollars were taken back to the Customs for confiscation.</p>
<h3>Gambling and Opium Den Broken Up in Juelu Hotel: Proprietor and Gamblers Arrested; Many Opium Pipes and Paste Seized</h3>
<p>Liu Yaying and Lu Dagong, Chinese police chiefs from the Laozha Police Station, recently learned that Rooms 108 and 82 of the Juelu Hotel at No. 250 Xizang Road were being used to organize large-scale opium sales and gambling dens. They began an investigation and learned that the operation was run by Ji Zengshou, a well-known gangster nicknamed "Little Marketplace Cake," and that the scale was very large. On the 12th of this month, they led detectives Wang Jiaju and Pang Yutang to raid the hotel. They arrested the proprietors, Hong Longsheng and Ji Zengshou from Suzhou, and the mahjong players Gu Bin, Li Jinsheng, Shan Kuanxian, and Chen Ahua in Room 108. They confiscated 145 yuan in gambling money, many chips, and arrested the gambling den employees Zhou Fusheng and Zhu Apei, as well as spectators Wu Meisheng, Hu Yaoxuan, Zhu Wanwen, Li Genfa, Cao Jinsheng, Wu Youwen, and Wang Sheng. In Room 82, they arrested Zhang Xiaoli for selling opium. Underneath a chair seat and the floor, they seized many opium pipes, opium paraphernalia, opium paste, and accounting books. The Juelu Hotel employee Zhang Ronggen testified that the gambling and opium den was opened by Hong Longsheng and Ji Zengshou and provided a written statement. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the circumstances, and charged them under Articles 266 and 268 of the Criminal Code and Articles 6 and 11 of the Anti-Opium Law. He stated that besides Gu Bin, Li Jinsheng, Shan Binxian, and Chen Ahua, who were gambling, the rest were spectators. However, the police believed that the other suspects were there to smoke opium and that there was evidence of both gambling and opium use for investigation. Liu, the police chief, reported the details of the raid. Zhang Ronggen, a Juelu Hotel employee, suddenly overturned his previous statement, claiming that Ji Zengshou had nothing to do with the two rooms, seemingly out of fear. When questioned, Hong Longsheng admitted that he set up the gambling den, but Ji Zengshou firmly denied it. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, the case was adjourned for one week. Hong Longsheng, Ji Zengshou, Zhang Xiaoli, Zhou Fusheng, and Zhu Apei were remanded in custody, and the rest were released on bail of 100 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Family Lawsuits Continue After Fei Keming's Death: Fei Yusheng Sues His Sister Fei Guijin: When Will the Sibling Rivalry End?</h3>
<p>After the death of Fei Keming, a local real estate merchant, disputes over inheritance led to infighting within the family. Initially, the eldest son, Fei Yusheng, sued his younger brother, Junwen, for robbing the ancestral tablet, and Junwen was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, suspended for two years. Later, Junwen's wife, Huang, also sued Yusheng and his son, Qigang, and his younger brother Meiwen's wife, Yang, for assault. Fei Yusheng was acquitted, and Qigang and Yang were found not guilty. Because his younger brother, Junwen, testified that the ancestral tablet was taken by his sister, Fei Guijin, Fei Yusheng filed another case against Guijin in the First Special District Court for desecrating the ancestral rites. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo summoned Fei Guijin in the Ninth Criminal Court, but she did not appear. Her lawyer, Jiang Guofang, appeared in court and stated that the current case and Fei Junwen's case are the same subject, and according to law, a case cannot be filed twice. He requested that a ruling be made first. Judge Dai stated that the defendant in the current case was not in the defendant position in Fei Junwen's case, so it was not illegal. He began the debate. After the two sides debated, he announced the end of the debate and scheduled a date for sentencing. It is unknown when this case of sibling rivalry will end.</p>
<h3>Gan Wenxin's False Business Exposed: Yao Wenqiao Spills the Beans</h3>
<p>Guan Zhuoru of Ruisheng Shenzhuang in Dunhou Lane, Xiaodongmen, specializes in shipping various goods needed by Fujian Province. In January of this year, Xu Zhixian, Chen Qizhou, and Gan Wenxin, who falsely established Fengji Shenzhuang, conspired to use Ruisheng's telegraphic code to swindle 4,000 yuan. After Guan discovered this, he reported it to the Yimiao Police Station, and Xu Zhixian, Chen Qizhou, and others were arrested and sent to the court for interrogation. Gan Wenxin, who was at large, changed his name to Yao Wenzhao and fled to Shashi Town in Zhejiang Province with the money, where he opened the Yuelai Candy Store. Recently, due to a fight with his business partner Yao Wenqiao, he was arrested by the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau in the town. Yao Wenqiao, resentful of the store owner's rudeness, revealed the situation of defrauding a large sum of money, changing his name, and fleeing to Shashi to open a store. Chen Yuwen, the director of the branch, telegraphed Guan Zhuoru to send a representative, Huang Wenan, to Shashi to identify Gan Wenxin. He was confirmed to be the same person using the alias Yao Wenzhao. A request was made to detain him. Subsequently, Director Liu of the Shanghai Police Station selected detectives Yuan Zhigang and police officer Wang Xiufeng to go to Shashi with a warrant to escort him back. Yesterday, the fraudster Yao Wenzhao was escorted back for interrogation and handed over to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Industrial Testing Laboratory's Invention: Scientific Gypsum Copper Plating Method Achieves Success</h3>
<p>Ordinary electroplating is mostly limited to metallic substances, and electroplating of non-metallic substances is still rare. Years ago, German scholars' research results made electroplating of non-metallic insulators a growing reality, becoming one of the latest scientific inventions. After several months of research by the Central Industrial Testing Laboratory of the Ministry of Industry, considerable progress has been made, and the copper plating of gypsum models has been completely successful. At the request of the Health Testing Department of the Executive Yuan, three copper-plated gypsum models were produced on behalf of the department, which were no different from those purchased by the department from Germany. The laboratory is currently continuing research on copper and gold and silver plating on paper, cloth, bone, wood, porcelain, leather, glass, etc., which is expected to be successful. At the same time, in order to meet social needs, the laboratory is now starting to undertake gypsum copper plating work entrusted by various parties.</p>

<h3>Penalty Rules for Ships Evading Taxes in This City: All Ship Owners Should Pay Special Attention</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that this year's ship owners often take advantage of the vast river area in this city and the difficulty in investigation, and often falsely report departures to evade taxes, the Finance Bureau of this city has specially ordered all ship tax offices to notify each other of the ship numbers applying for departure, distribute them to various inspectors for strict investigation, and reach an agreement with the Public Utilities Bureau. In the future, for ships canceling leave, the various ship offices must check the customs registration book for civil ships to find out whether there are any false reports of departure and entry. If there are any false reports of tax evasion, once verified, in addition to making up for the evaded taxes, a heavier penalty will be imposed in accordance with the regulations in order to maintain tax collection. It is reported that last month, the Shanghai South Ship Tax Office discovered more than 20 ships falsely reporting departure on the Longhua River and imposed penalties in accordance with the regulations. Now that ship owners see that the ship tax office's inspection is very strict, those who applied for leave last month but have not yet left this month mostly take the initiative to the shipping office to return the cargo ship license, or register with the ship tax office and pay taxes with the cargo ship license retention certificate to avoid being discovered and penalized by the ship tax office. The relevant clauses of the bureau's rules on penalties for ships violating regulations are attached below for reference by all ship owners in this city. "Article 5": If a ship that has been inspected but has evaded taxes is found, in addition to being ordered to pay the monthly tax for the current term and making up for the evaded taxes in accordance with Article 8 of the Detailed Rules for the Collection of Ship Taxes, the following fines will be imposed according to the grade: (A) Those who have evaded taxes for more than one month shall be fined half of the monthly tax payable; (B) Those who have evaded taxes for more than two months shall be fined the amount of one month's tax payable; (C) Those who have evaded taxes for more than six months shall be fined twice the amount of one month's tax payable; (D) Those who have evaded taxes for more than nine months shall be fined three times the amount of one month's tax payable. "Article 6" Whoever falsely reports departure but still sails in the rivers of this city and intentionally evades taxes, in addition to being handled in accordance with Article 5, shall be subject to an additional fine of one month's tax.</p>
<p>Large Robbery Case at the Post Office: Police Officer in the Stamp Room Involved; Fang Charged with Inciting Robbery; Remanded for Further Joint Trial</p>
<p>In the robbery case at the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road, eight men and women, including the criminals Ji Rentang, Qiu Guobin, and the woman Ji Chen, were arrested by the Detectives of the DSW Road Police Station and sent to the First Special District District Court for a continued hearing on the afternoon of the 16th of this month. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Earlier, Ji Chen confessed that she had helped the criminal Wu Pangui from Anhui Province, 45 years old, (i.e., the police officer stationed in the stamp room on the first floor of the post office by the Public Security Bureau of West Bund Road). He had participated in the meeting and the police station notified the Public Security Bureau to detain the Wu police officer and send him to the Shanghai District Court for detention. He was brought back the day before yesterday, and yesterday morning, the lawyer of the Bureau of Works, Li Zhishan, stated that the defendant Wu Pangui was identified by the arrested criminal Ji Chen as having visited the post office twice before to discuss robbing property, but he firmly denied it. Now, in accordance with Articles 30 and 330 of the Criminal Law on assisting and inciting robbery, he is filing a public prosecution and requesting detention, pending joint trial with Ji Chen, etc. When questioned, the Wu police officer confessed that he was sleeping in the bedroom when the post office was robbed because he was on the night shift on the 8th. He did not know Ji Chen. The rest of his confession was vague. He asked for consideration. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered that he still be detained and rescheduled the joint trial for 2:00 pm on the 16th.</p>

<h3>Lu Xihou Sued for Fraud Continues to Be Heard; Lu Zutong Surrenders Himself Yesterday; Clarifying the Discounting Process of Promissory Notes</h3>
<p>China and Foreign Bank has been closed for a year since the day after the Double Tenth Festival last year. The actual directors of the bank, Lu Xihou, manager Lu Mengxiang, and Sun Xiren, were arrested by the police station at the time and prosecuted by the First Special District District Court for crimes such as fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust. Later, because the two Lu applied to declare the bank bankrupt, this criminal lawsuit was temporarily suspended. Recently, all civil matters have been resolved by the court one after another, so the public prosecution previously filed by the police station was reheard by Judge Qian Hongye. However, when the civil court</p>
<p>was conducting the trial, it was discovered that the bank had issued three promissory notes, each worth 5,000 yuan, on October 1 last year, all dated October 11 of the same month, and discounted them at the Kunshan and Suzhou branches of Ningbo Industrial Bank before they expired. After the bank closed, Wu Zhihao, the general manager of Ningbo Industrial Bank, ordered Lu Zutong, the manager of the Kunshan branch, to represent them in suing Lu Xihou and others to the First Special Court. Later, an out-of-court settlement was reached. Ningbo Industrial Bank believed that it had priority over the discounted funds and could not be treated the same as ordinary creditors, so it</p>
<p>did not suffer losses. After the accountant verified this situation, he reported the facts truthfully, causing the police station to determine that Lu Zutong was suspected of colluding with Lu Xihou and others to obtain illegal benefits, causing other creditors to suffer unexpected losses. Therefore, a lawsuit for fraud was also filed against Lu Zutong. The court session was held last week, but Zutong failed to appear after being summoned, and the trial was postponed. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian continued the joint interrogation. Lu Zutong surrendered himself with his defense lawyers Wu Peng and Lu Qi. The others, Lu Xihou, Lu Mengxiang, and Sun Xiren, also attended the court with their defense lawyers Wu Lindi and Fan Gang. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station</p>
<p>stated the prosecution. After questioning Zutong about the case, he requested that Qi Shengfeng, a staff member of Talley &amp; Company who was present in court, be questioned first about the transfer of the title deed at that time regarding Lu Xihou's wife, Wang, using a title deed to entrust it to the China Industrial Bank and then being mortgaged by the bank to the Siming Bank. The court then read it to Qi once, and then lawyer Wu Goukun explained in detail the reason for the repeated mortgage of the title deed, supplementing the lack of Lu Xihou's confession, saying that Lu borrowed the title deed from his wife because the bank needed funds, but he did not want the bank to be known as a lender, so he ordered his wife to</p>
<p>mortgage a title deed to the bank's business department for 70,000 yuan, and then deposit the funds in the savings department. The bank then used the title deed as collateral for receiving banknotes from Siming Bank. Later, Lu did not want to make those related to him, such as Daqian World, etc., owe the bank money, so he took out 70,000 yuan from his wife's savings department to repay the debts. The court then asked the defendant Lu Zutong to study the discounting process. According to his confession, on October 1 last year, Wu from China Industrial Bank negotiated the discounting of three promissory notes. I discounted two of them at the Kunshan branch of Ningbo Industrial Bank, totaling 10,000 yuan. The remaining one, worth 5,000 yuan, was discounted by Wu at the Suzhou branch. Wu</p>
<p>stated verbally that the rent of the building of China and Foreign Bank was used as a guarantee for the promissory note. Later, before the note expired, the bank had closed. General Manager Wu Zhihao transferred one of the notes collected by the Suzhou branch to me and sued Lu Xihou and others. The court verified the confession and said that according to the accountant's report, one note worth 5,000 yuan had already been cashed by China Industrial Bank, so the confession may not be true. He said that there was no need to hide it and that he should confess quickly to avoid being punished. He also questioned the defendant Lu Mengxiang about the issuance of the promissory notes, and then ordered the debate to begin, but it was too late, and the lawyers did not have time to finish their speeches. The bell rang five times, and Judge Qian ordered that the hearing be continued next Wednesday afternoon. Lu Zutong was released on bail or collateral with 1,000 yuan in cash.</p>

<h3>French Concession: Baoyu Lane Rent Reduced by 10%</h3>

Starting this month, all tenants will pay their rent at a 10% discount from the original amount.</p>

<h3>Private Chop Forgery: Swindling Four Bicycles; Zhang Yifang Masterminds and Flees, Chen Fuliang and Xu Adi Arrested</h3>
<p>Song Linfu, a native of Nantong, runs a bicycle shop named Linfu Bicycle Shop at No. 2098 Route Higer.

He handed over the four bicycles to the four men, who rode them away. After waiting until the next day without seeing them return, he went to Huang's house to inquire. Huang was completely unaware and denied having guaranteed the rental of any bicycles. While the two were wondering about this, one of the men who had come to rent the bicycles rode back to return one. Song immediately detained him, called the police, and sent him to the Xuhui Police Station. After interrogation by the station chief, the man confessed his name was Chen Fuliang, 16 years old, a Shanghai native residing at No. 9, Lane 78, Wuditou, and worked as a carpenter. He said that Zhang Yifang came up with the idea, knowing that Huang and Song were friendly and that he could rent bicycles with Huang's seal. He then discussed it with Xu Adi, a Songjiang native residing at No. 27 Triangle Ground who worked as a tailor. They went to a seal-engraving shop to privately engrave Wang Jin-xing's seal, wrote out a guarantee slip, and went to Song's shop to rent four bicycles. He rode one, and the others were ridden by Guo Zhangfang, 24 years old, a tailor residing at No. 18 Yinjiajiao, Shi Aqing, 17 years old, a carpenter residing at No. 11 Wuditou, and Shen Jingen, 17 years old, a carpenter residing at No. 1 Shenjiazhai. The three men each rode one to Songjiang. Because they had no money for food, they pawned one bicycle for eight yuan. The other two bicycles were taken away by Zhang Yifang. Fearing implication, he rode back to return the bicycle. After Chen's confession, the station chief ordered the police to arrest Guo, Shi, and Shen. Xu Adi was sent to the station by his father. Yesterday, all of them were sent to the Shanghai Public Safety Bureau for interrogation, and a strict search is underway for Zhang Yifang, who is still at large, to bring him to justice and recover the stolen bicycles.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Seven Counties Association Held Annual Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Association of natives from the seven counties of Shaoxing held its 25th annual members' meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM at its clubhouse on Avenue Albert. Mr. Zhu Xiaofan was elected chairman and the meeting proceeded with formalities. The chairman appointed Xu Xiajun, He Wuliang, Yao Jiafu, and Zhang Zheng-gang as ritual officers. The chairman then reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that according to the association's charter, the annual meeting should have been held on the 6th of this month, but due to work-related reasons, most of the natives were not in Shanghai at that time, so it was postponed to today. The association has been established for 25 years, but its affairs have not been fully developed, mainly because the natives have too shallow a view of the association. The number of people attending today's meeting is not large. During the National Games, it may be because the members have considerable faith in the association's staff and are too busy to spare time and are at ease with the association. Shrouded in an economic downturn, the backbone of our natives in Shanghai are mostly in the financial sector, and finance is the center of all industries. I believe that only struggle can break through this difficult situation, and only unity and mutual assistance can achieve the goal of struggle. The so-called "Heaven never cuts off all means of survival" can teach oneself, benefit fellow natives, and benefit society. At this gathering of our natives, we should encourage each other. This year is an election year. I hope that the committee members will work hard on the association's affairs, seek the welfare of the natives in Shanghai, and seek social order in the interior. With one heart and one mind, the whole, not divided, uses a new talent pool to develop new paths for the association. Then, Zheng Wentong reported on general affairs, Yan Chengde reported on financial affairs, and Shou Xiaotian reported on fundraising affairs. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee representative Qian Youlan gave a speech, followed by discussions on: (1) Group insurance for members of the association, with members paying a small insurance fee each year, to negotiate with the China United Assurance Corporation in the name of the group. It was resolved in principle to pass the case. The execution committee will handle whether to designate China United Assurance Corporation and how to handle it. (2) For the convenience of insurance and native communication, another directory of members will be printed, detailing their name, age, occupation, address, etc. It was decided to handle it jointly with the first case. (3) Collect the association's original books and solicit publications from domestic agencies, bureaus, and schools to run a popular library for the benefit of the natives. It was decided that the executive committee will handle how to develop the association's original library within the possible scope of implementation. (4) Invite fellow natives from the banking industry to discuss developing hometown industries, such as improving papermaking, afforestation, and running a cement factory. It was decided to transfer it to the executive committee to consult with the banking industry and handle it as appropriate. (5) Propose soliciting member background information for record keeping. It was decided to carry out native registration and establish county group committees in each county to cooperate. (6) Propose increasing scholarships for children of the seven counties. It was decided to organize free registration for fellow natives, handle it in detail, and hand it over to the executive committee to handle. After the discussion, the results of the election of executive and supervisory committee members were announced: Wang Xiaolai, Pei Yunqing, Yan Chengde, Wang Yansong, Shou Xiaotian, Song Hantong, Xu Laijun, Xu Qianlin, Zhu Yaochen, Weng Yunhe, Zheng Wentong, Feng Zhongqing, Wei Qifang, Yuan Ludeng, Shen Jingke, Qi Ziquan, Wei Hongwen, Wei Shanfu, Yao Jiashi, Zhu Yun-san, Feng Meixue, Yu Qishan, Yuan Jinchu, Lu Zhinan, Huang Longchu, He Wuliang, Shen Jiuyu, He Eran, Tian Dafu, Xie Yunshou, and Shen Jinhuai were elected as executive committee members. Feng Yangyuan, Gao Peiliang, Shi Jiu'ao, Zhu Detian, Tong Xinbo, Shen Jinzhou, Hu Disheng, Lou Fengshao, and Zhao Weiren were elected as alternate executive committee members. Zhao Zichuan, Jiang Quanmao, Wang Juru, Shen Jinyong, Wu Guochang, Zhu Dingyi, Tian Qiyuan, Hu Chunxiang, Gu Wenchao, Xie Taofu, Shen Jian-san, Tian Xiangru, Lu Tingjian, Sun Jitang, and Xie Shaogeng were elected as supervisory committee members. Jin Jianqing, He Zhongxiao, Lu Zhengbing, Tao Baichuan, and Qi Yongqing were elected as alternate supervisory committee members. After the elections, a dinner was held. At the same time, Yue Opera performers from the Gongyu and Yuesheng troupes were invited to perform Yue Opera to add to the fun. Valuable gifts were distributed to commemorate the occasion. The event lasted until midnight and then everyone dispersed happily.</p>

<h3>Eight Major Fur Goods Stores Sell Off Stock at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Hengruntai, Yuanshentai, Qinghexing, Qianfayuan, Tianqingfu, Qianfengtai, Dajicheng, and Tianfaxiang, eight major fur goods stores, recently sold off all the remaining stock of Zhengxiangtai and Lao Xiangtai at low prices, worth more than 220,000 yuan. They are now in the process of sorting and marking down the prices, selling them off at 10% to 50% of the original price. Items that used to sell for ten yuan at Zhengxiangtai and Lao Xiangtai are now selling for only one to five yuan. Each item is marked with the actual price, allowing customers to choose freely. This kind of low-price sale is truly a new record in the fur goods industry.</p>
<h3>Hunan Renji Factory's Refined Pencil Lead Powder Sells Well; Purity Above 95 Degrees</h3>
<p>Pencil lead powder is an essential raw material for manufacturing dry batteries. Domestic battery factories generally use imported goods, and the demand is quite large, costing over 500 yuan per ton, which is a major drain. Although Jiangsu also has this mineral product, it is not suitable for use due to its poor quality. The pencil lead powder refined by the Hunan Renji Industrial Raw Material Factory has a pure and good quality, with a purity above 95 degrees. Its efficacy is comparable to imported goods, but its price is less than half of the imported price. At present, battery factories in Guangdong and Guangxi, which used to use imported goods, are now happy to use the factory's products, and procurement is quite enthusiastic. It is reported that the factory's business office is located at No. 8 Xiahe Street, Changsha, Hunan. For Shanghai-related inquiries, please contact Mr. Wang Xingchu of Shishi Xinbao, Chang Geng Li, Avenue Edward VII, as representative.</p>
<h3>Central Photo Studio Opens Branch at the Confucius Temple</h3>
<p>The Central Photo Studio at Fangbang Bridge has been in business for many years and has a long history of service. The photographs taken are exceptionally clear. The photographers' skills are superb, personally guided by Mr. Qing Wu, so the products are excellent, and the prices are more modest than other businesses. As a result, the studio is crowded every day. Now, to promote convenience for customers, a branch has been established at the Confucius Temple. The natural scenery there is extremely elegant, so the photographers have also been very busy recently.</p>

<p>Oriental Wireless Electric Insurance Company Offers Preferential Treatment to Customers</p>
<p>Since the Oriental Wireless Electric Insurance Company, located next to the East Silk Industry Bank on Shilu, Third Malu, expanded its internal operations, many people have enthusiastically insured their radios there. Most of these radios are often taken there for repairs due to sound insulation issues, and the repair fees are completely free of charge. Now, the company, after receiving letters from various sectors of society requesting amendments to the new regulations and extending the insurance period to six months for each contract, decided, after discussion, to adopt the premise of catering to the psychology of people in society and offering preferential treatment to customers. Regardless of whether they are already insured or not, all are subject to the new regulations. The new regulations stipulate that imported products are 6 yuan for six months, and domestic products are 3 yuan for six months. If there is any damage during the insurance period, all repairs and compensation are free. The telephone number is 96166. If it is inconvenient due to distance, you can call and they will arrive immediately.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the news report on page 11 of section three of your newspaper dated October 14th regarding the negotiations for the capsized tugboat, the details stated are not consistent with the actual situation. In addition to the captain of the ship reporting the facts to the union, the driving aspect is afraid of confusing rumors, and a special letter is used to declare it. Sincerely request that you publish a letter in the corrections column, which is public sentiment. To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Shanghai Xiexing Shipping Transfer Company, 10/14</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read a news item in today's edition of your newspaper regarding a conflict between members of the Wusong Defense Corps and a barber, which led to a barber strike. The facts are greatly inconsistent. On the afternoon of the 10th of this month, suddenly twenty to thirty rioters gathered on Taixing Road and fought each other. Police officer Ye Yousheng of the nearby (No. 1862) post attempted to stop them but was beaten. The police officer then frantically blew his whistle for help. Yang Zixiang, a squad leader in our corps, heard the sound and went forward to assist in the arrest, but was also violently beaten by the rioters, suffering head injuries and bleeding profusely. His military cap was also stolen. At the time, the ringleader Wang Shun-gao was apprehended, who confessed that he was invited by his sister-in-law, a barber, and other barbers to come and fight. Others who committed the assault and injured Squad Leader Yang include Wu Dahai, Wang Shunwen, Cao Jinshan, and three others whose names he could not remember. Other confessions were evasive. Subsequently, the Wusong Police Station apprehended both sides of the dispute and sent them to the judicial section for interrogation. Because our corps squad leader Yang Zixiang is in the position of the plaintiff, he is also one of the witnesses, so he also has to be brought to the case for questioning. As for the continued arrest of the suspects yesterday, the Yunzaobang Police Station has been consulted to assist in the matter, and there is nothing illegal to be said. Whether the strike is legitimate from a rational or emotional standpoint is not something our corps seems to be able to point out, but the facts are obviously inconsistent with what is stated in your newspaper. Since this concerns public opinion, we have specially prepared this letter to ask you to correct it. We hope you will take this into consideration. To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao Headquarters, Shanghai Wusong Defense Corps, 10/13</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Supply Exceeds Demand; Japanese Banks Sell English Currency, Korean Banks Sell English Currency… Chinese Banks Sell American Currency on the Mainland</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, the American market was entirely closed. Only in London were short-term and long-term transactions close to par. Forward silver prices in Menterri remained unchanged. London spot gold dropped by half a penny. The British pound rose 1.25 against the US dollar and remained unchanged against the French franc. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of the British pound at one shilling and six pence and one-eighth. The US dollar was at 37.0625 yuan. Compared with last Saturday, the British pound and the US dollar were level. Market sentiment was weak, trending towards easing after opening. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with the British pound and the US dollar both level. Customs gold units also remained unchanged. Banks took advantage of the low prices to buy in, immediately stabilizing the market. However, the selling by Japanese and Mainland banks was difficult to sustain. It was anticipated that the HSBC Bank's posted rates would keep the British pound and the US dollar both level. At this point, to balance supply and demand, Sassoon and others slightly bought in and hovered. However, Chinese banks such as Bank of Communications and Continental Bank continued to supply, and market sentiment remained weak, eventually strengthening again. It was predicted that Indian silver would fall by one anna. At noon, it slightly turned peaceful. Later in the market, although banks continued to sell, Chinese merchants suddenly competed to buy in, resulting in an oversupply that gradually strengthened the market. The initial quote for Indian silver was one anna, and the Hong Kong market softened, becoming tighter. However, banks took advantage of the high prices to sell together, stabilizing the situation. Later, Indian silver rebounded to four annas in the second quote, briefly turning level, but ultimately maintained its position. The closing near-term selling price for the British pound was one shilling and six pence and a quarter, and the US dollar was at 37.25 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, the British pound eased by one-eighth and the US dollar hardened by 0.1875. Chinese merchants bought in about 100,000 US dollars. Japanese and Korean banks sold English currency, and Chinese banks sold American currency on the mainland. The transaction records for today are listed below.</p>

<h3>Interbank Loan Rate Unchanged; Double Dime Coins Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday (Monday), the interbank loan rate for foreign currency remained at 13% in both the morning and afternoon markets. Checks for transfer were also used in vain. In terms of interbank loan transactions, over 3.8 million was transferred in the morning market, with over 400,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon market, transactions amounted to 600,000, and transactions within the Small Clearing House totaled over 500,000. Although the head-of-line funds were still abundant in the afternoon, checks for transfer were ultimately used in vain. However, within the Small Clearing House, there was a slight clearance, resulting in a market of 2-3%. Transactions involving foreign currency pledges were slightly more active at 10%. The total amount of redemptions was over 900,000, and new loans amounted to over 1.3 million. 800,000 in banknotes were recovered, 400,000 in marked banknotes were issued, 900,000 in circulating banknotes, 400,000 from customer sources, and 250,000 from the "fu wei" (likely a typo for "fu wei", meaning "auxiliary"). Money shops and public banks received over 44.4 million, over 5.24 million in foreign exchange transfers, over 500,000 in remittances from various sources, and 400,000 in cash settlements. Banks received over 3.56 million in remittances from foreign banks, over 4.5 million in miscellaneous remittances for various goods and exchanges, 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlements, over 900,000 in special remittances, over 1.4 million in difference settlements, and 600,000 in warehouse receipts. Chinese banks received over 4.1 million in remittances, over 5.9 million in miscellaneous remittances for various goods and exchanges, over 1.34 million in foreign exchange settlements, over 800,000 in special remittances, over 1.8 million in difference settlements, and 700,000 in warehouse receipts. Japanese banks received over 3.3 million in remittances, over 4.3 million in miscellaneous remittances for various goods and exchanges, over 700,000 in special remittances, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 500,000 in warehouse receipts.</p>
<p>In recent days, Guangdong small silver coins have gradually increased in price. Yesterday, they felt stronger. Although they were similar to the previous day, they did not see a large increase, but the situation has the potential to rise again. The price was 760.05 yuan in the morning market and 760.08 yuan in the afternoon market. The trading volume was 155,000 in the morning market and 65,000 in the afternoon market. The price of Jiangnan small silver coins was 831.2 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, slightly better than the previous day's afternoon market by 0.2 yuan. The trading volume was 2,000 in the morning market and 3,000 in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins was reduced by 1,000 wen, to 339,000 wen, with a trading volume of 37,290 strings, equivalent to 11,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities: Securities Suddenly Plunged Four Times Yesterday—A Rare Occurrence in Recent Months</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced a sudden and major storm, with a very sharp decline. Various "gangs" vigorously sold, with No. 16 shorting additional shares and No. 54 longs liquidating. Selling was extremely enthusiastic. Others, such as Nos. 4, 46, and 69, also consistently sold. For a time, a strong selling atmosphere prevailed in the market. On the buying side were Nos. 14, 34, 64, and 72, but supply and demand were still unbalanced. No. 48, a long, was also still adding shares slightly. The market sentiment appeared somewhat panicked. The reason for this was entirely the shadow of terrifying rumors, undoubtedly closely related to the Dalian Conference. Yesterday, the market opened with a small drop of about 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. The trend still felt even. In the second round, selling was even more intense, and the decline became increasingly severe. The current month plummeted 0.7 yuan. When the afternoon market opened, the selling pressure was even greater. Quite a few longs from the morning turned short in the afternoon. Northern "gangs" further down the list slightly bought. As the price of Current Month contract Number 6 returned one jiao, the decline stopped at this point, but by closing time, the late evening news was bad. Number 11 sold Kuang Mai Tsai Ping, suddenly plummeting another 0.8 or 0.9 yuan. After this the decline moderated somewhat, but still fell 0.3, 0.5 or 0.6 yuan. The fall was too violent, and there may be a small reversal. The resulting market price fell approximately one yuan to six yuan. The total volume traded was approximately 30 million yuan. The results of the price changes are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Cotton Yarn Prices Decline Sharply</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continued to decline, and the situation deteriorated further. Various rumors flew about in the local area, and the various stories were inconsistent, making it difficult for people to feel at ease. Cotton prices loosened, and the selling atmosphere became slightly stronger. However, the current yarn situation remained profitable due to the tight fundamental situation. Selling prices did not fall, and merchants from Sichuan made considerable purchases.</p>
<p>The prices of graded yarn declined in both morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<p>The graded yarn market opened in the morning, with prices declining across all months. Rumors spread, benefiting the shorts. The selling atmosphere in the market was particularly strong, with prices declining by 7, 8, and 9 jiao across all months. After 2 o'clock, there was little change. By closing, news came that Osaka's Sanpin cotton yarn had risen sharply by 2-3 yuan, slightly stimulating the sluggish yarn market and pushing prices back up by a few jiao. As a result, prices for all months still fell by 3, 4, 5, and 6 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session opened with a flat and weak tone. The market sentiment was very loose and became softer as the auction progressed, entirely due to the attack of rumors. As a result, prices for all months fell by 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Dafeng offered 1,000 bales, Xinchang 500 bales, Mingde 400 bales, Zhenda 750 bales, Shenji 500 bales, Renfeng 1,150 bales, Runkang 500 bales, Gengfeng 400 bales, Yicheng 600 yuan, and Yichang 700 bales. Tongji purchased 450 bales, Dafu 800 bales, Yuanda 800 bales, Jinchang 750 bales, Dachangcheng 900 bales, Yichang 650 bales, Changfeng 750 bales, Hengchang 650 bales, Taichang 500 bales, and Tonghe 850 bales.

<p>Spot Yarn Sales Were Quiet</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were still good. Statistics show that a total of 1,305 bales were purchased throughout the day. Market conditions were stable. The purchase volumes by various merchants are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxi 50, Changsha 25, Inland 180, Nanyang 30</p>
<p>Guangdong 170, Jiujiang 5, Ningbo 10, Sichuan 555</p>
<p>Xiamen 10, Shantou 25, Trading Companies 5, Wuhu 15</p>
<p>Xuzhou 10, Yunnan 115</p>
<p>The cotton market declined further, because after prices rose so high, demand turned sluggish. Therefore, some cotton merchants came back to sell. The market saw loose chips, and graded gold rebounded slightly, but sentiment remained weak.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Moved Lower Round by Round</p>
<p>The graded cotton market opened in the morning. Because the US cotton market was closed and Indian cotton rose slightly by 0.25 rupees, the market was very flat. There were few sellers in the market, and demand for current cotton turned sluggish again. The first round suppressed one jiao, and there were few changes after the second round. By closing, news came that Osaka's Sanpin cotton had jumped by 0.6-0.7 yuan, artificially inflating sentiment again. However, the near months fell by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the distant months remained flat. The afternoon session opened with a very soft market, and prices continued to fall because some cotton firms sold large quantities, resulting in an abundance of chips. As a result, all prices fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Zhenda sold 1,100 dan, Tongji 1,800 dan, Hexing 1,200 dan, Changyu 1,300 dan, Shenji 2,400 dan, Jiankang 1,600 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,900 dan, Yuanyuan 1,000 dan, Dachangcheng 1,000 dan, Yichang 1,300 dan, Changfeng 3,200 dan, and Shengyuan 2,000 dan.

<p>Yarn Market Warehouse Inventories Decreased Sharply</p>
<p>As of the 14th, the total amount of yarn stored in the warehouses of the Chinese Merchants Cotton Yarn Exchange was 4,575 bales, of which 510 bales were overdue and could not be delivered. The number of 17-count Fugui yarn was 1,605 bales, and the number of 16-count Shuanglong yarn was 1,030 bales. These two brands had the largest inventories. The brand count and bale amount are listed below (unit: bales). Those marked with × are overdue yarns.</p>

<h3>Grains: All Types of Du Yang Rice Fell</h3>
<p>The source of local rice (Shanghai South) was more than twenty companies (more than 4,000 shi of goods). However, the sales market was not strong, resulting in a quiet situation. The market price continued to soften, with thick broken rice falling by several fen. The Jing (round-grain) broken rice was only consumed by over a hundred packages by restaurant owners, and further fell by nearly one jiao. The kiln-grown Baige and other new thin rice and all thick new round-grain rice also continued to fall by about one jiao. As for the various types of new top-quality rice such as Du Yang rice, their sales continued to slacken, and the market price continued to soften. The recent yin (likely meaning "hidden") change in yuan (silver dollar) meant supply and demand were balanced. Both new and old goods were neither doing particularly well nor poorly.</p>
<p>13th - 14th - Change</p>
<p>South Port Early Broken - 10.35 - 10.25 - Down 0.10</p>
<p>Qingjiao Kiln Seed - 9.95 - 9.80 - Down 0.15</p>
<p>Tongli New Geng - 9.80 - 9.70 - Down 0.10</p>
<p>Qingjiao Lu Jian - 9.15 - 9.00 - Down 0.15</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Ships arriving with cargo numbers 36 and 37. The consumption of broken rice was still weak, and the price was tired by several fen. The spot sales of new round-grain rice were also weak in the morning market. The restaurant sales were slightly better in the afternoon market. The market sentiment turned from tired to stable. Since the arrival of goods from Yuan (another region), the spot sales had been weak, and the price was tired by two jiao. The kiln-grown Baige thin rice went along the same ordinary path, with a small price (outside the small price). The new yang tip and du tip rice were stabilized, with a route to the concession guests (likely meaning foreign merchants). The price tightened again by several fen to nearly one jiao. The fixed price of the other goods was stable.</p>
<p>The foreign Rong Xian rice was tired and fell in the morning, but turned stable in the afternoon because the customer's Xian rice never ended. Although the appetite of this street was active, it did not end due to its arrival, and the sales were slightly dull in the morning. The customer's Xian rice, high and medium grade, all fell by five or six fen to one jiao, and the Yonghu white rice suddenly fell by half a jiao. Although this street took advantage of small purchases in the afternoon, the market turned stable. The whole day saw the sale of 1,086 packages of Yong rice, 310 packages of Gan rice, 150 packages of Wan rice, 300 packages of Shashi rice, 1,400 packages of Taizhou rice, 200 packages of Hunan rice, and 170 packages of Jing Xian rice. Apart from a small number of Yong rice sold from Tianjin, all was handled by this street. As for the foreign rice, the bottom inventory was gradually decreasing. The owners were very persistent. Yesterday, they were pressured by the influx of customer's Xian rice, and the owners were even more defensive, so the whole day only opened up to more than 300 packages of Saigon rice and 100 packages of large crushed rice, which was handled by this street.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales Have Returned to Normal</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market unanimously fell sharply. The quotation for foreign wheat (Canadian) fell by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Market sentiment, due to the international situation not expanding, was generally high, and there was considerable fear. Furthermore, the actual sales appetite in recent days was really plain. Therefore, the buying sentiment was not strong, but the outgoing quantity was quite prosperous. Therefore, the asking prices for each month fell by between 0.02 and 0.03 yuan. Transactions reached over 400,000 bags. Forced to the afternoon opening, the transaction turned quiet. There were very few incoming and outgoing quantities from the factory. External speculation had a slight sucking force, and all the months recovered to near zero compared to the morning closing price. However, if the exchange rate lasts long, I am afraid that foreign wheat will have to move again.</p>
<p>Saturday Closing Price - Yesterday's Closing Price - Comparison</p>
<p>October - 2.6875 - 2.6675 - Down 0.0200</p>
<p>November - 2.7175 - 2.7050 - Down 0.0125</p>
<p>December - 2.7425 - 2.7350 - Down 0.0075</p>

<p>March - 2.7975 - 2.7800 - Down 0.0175</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Stable in the Near Term, Tired in the Far Term</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was stable in the near term and tired in the far term. With the quotation for foreign wheat showing weakness, market sentiment was fictitious. However, the present month's situation did not have the current wheat loosen, and the special high-quality goods still opened at 0.4 yuan. Customers were still unwilling to sell a large number of goods, so trading was very lonely, and the price was stable. In the distant month, because the Italian-Ethiopian situation was stagnant, there was a possibility of a sharp drop. Thus, market sentiment was just normal, with a decline of between 0.03 and 0.05 yuan. The market conditions for current wheat were still calm, with the opening price for Shandong wheat at 4.4 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 4.38 yuan, Shaheji wheat at 4.37 yuan, Hankou wheat at 4.32 yuan, the next at 4.3 yuan, and Huai'an cou at 4.34 yuan. Fu Xin shipped 4,000 bags, and Fu Feng shipped 1,000 bags.</p>

<h3>Oil Market: Theory that Tung Oil Production is High This Year</h3>
<p>After the standard-weight white tung oil had its stock sold off, many of the non-standard-weight goods were purchased by foreign firms in the Hankou market. However, because prices rose too much, the reaction was also strong. Recently, because US prices fell sharply, the Hankou foreign firms have all stopped doing business. The price of futures for the past 12 months once peaked at 70 yuan per report, but recently has fallen to 60 yuan, and the foreign firms still do not greedily take it. Although the current price has no official market price, it is being secretly brewed. The new oil in each producing area has started to be pressed, and the day the new oil reaches Hankou is near. In the future, the new goods can also be assessed at the current market price of 60 yuan. Once they open, a sudden drop of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan in the market will happen, which is shocking. If one is not cautious with this kind of market condition, one can easily be impacted by it. It is a misfortune for those engaged in this business. Therefore, there are very few new oil transactions, because the market price has not been on the right track. Those who want to do business do not dare to touch it. Even if the price falls to between 50 and 60 yuan, it is still a high price, and the weather is very hot this year. According to someone who did an investigation in the Zhejiang area, the output is said to have doubled compared to previous years.</p>
<h3>Metals: New Shipments of Tinplate Recently Arrived</h3>
<p>The No. 24 tinplate is in high demand by spinning mills. Yesterday, it was heard that a certain metal shop sold three boxes, each box at 110 yuan. This is an increase of about 0.4 yuan compared to the previous price. It was heard that Yichang Metal Shop on North Suzhou Road recently received a shipment of No. 24 tinplate, 21 inches wide and 30 inches long. There are 56 sheets per box, and they cost only 48 yuan. It was heard that due to the shortage of genuine goods, these were also opened up for selling 10 boxes, with most of them being disassembled by other merchants, and many factory owners also came to purchase them.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Lu Zhuang Zhen Mei Tea Sells Well in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market continued to be active. The Zhen Mei green tea from Tunxi Xixi Pan Shu and other districts continued to sell well in Europe. The business in fine stem tea was slightly more active than before. Yesterday, firms such as Xiehe, Yihua, Jinlong, Baochang, and Fulin purchased over 1,800 boxes of Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei, Gong Xi, and Xia Mu green teas. The prices were stable, and the overall trend has improved slightly compared to the previous period. However, the sales of Russian-grade green tea were completely stagnant, and coarse tea was greatly affected.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Concerning Intellectuals</h3>
<p>— Gan Nu</p>
<p>Mr. Cao Juren has recently been very dismissive of intellectuals. I remember him expressing sentiments like "Scholars are useless," and now in his article "Rectifying the Mildew of the May Fourth Movement" (Free Talk, October 8th), he said the following:</p>
<p>I feel that intellectuals are the least reliable. They are good at righteous indignation, but also the most likely to sell themselves. Liang Qichao praised Yang Du as the most spirited youth, but it was he who placed Yuan Shikai on the emperor's throne. Zhao Xinbo, who was a leader of the patriotic movement in Shanghai, is now a top-ranking traitor there. As Huang Yuansheng himself described, he went as a student representative to apply for the so-called "despotic" Nanyang Public School. The most dangerous thing about the drifting consciousness of intellectuals is depicting the student representatives of the May Fourth Movement as pure social activists. That is most dangerous...too few student representatives are willing to serve society from beginning to end!</p>
<p>It is well known that intellectuals are prone to change due to their social status; it goes without saying. What Bi Xue points out is Mr. Cao's assertion of "the least reliable," mainly referring to first being "filled with righteous indignation," and then "selling oneself," not "being willing to serve society from beginning to end," meaning turning bad. Of course, there is some merit to these words. For example, it can teach those outside the intellectual class to rely on their own strength when engaging in any movement, not to blindly trust intellectuals, to constantly monitor and urge them, and to prevent the regression and betrayal of intellectuals and their own deception. At the same time, it can also alert intellectuals themselves, strengthen their determination, and overcome their weaknesses.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Cao seems to portray the corruption of intellectuals as something predestined, irredeemable, and all-encompassing. If the corruption of intellectuals is predestined, we need not offer our enthusiasm for any movement, let alone overcome our own inferior nature, because it is impossible to save them anyway. It would be better for everyone to know their place and "sell themselves" directly. If all intellectuals are unreliable, the masses should, of course, completely disregard their intellectual stars and drive these "non-one-of-us" fellows out of the ranks as soon as possible. If this interpretation is permissible, Mr. Cao's opinion is dangerous enough.</p>
<p>First of all, the intellectual Mr. Cao refers to is just an abstract noun. From this noun, apart from knowing that they have knowledge, we get nothing else. What kind of knowledge is it? What is the living environment of a particular intellectual? Without understanding these conditions, it is too early to determine whether he is reliable or not. For example, Zheng Xiaoxu, the former Prime Minister of "Manchukuo," is he not an intellectual? Is Lin Yutang, the "master," not also an intellectual? One was a "top-ranking" traitor in "Manchukuo," and the other lived in the Republic of China, praising the ancestors of the "Manchukuo" king, the traitor "Lord Zeng Wenzheng." In Mr. Cao's view, this is, of course, confirmation of their "unreliability." But isn't the ability to "entrust a six-foot orphan, to entrust a hundred-mile fate," protecting the young ruler and reviving the country, exhausting all efforts, the highest expression of "a bit of solitary loyalty and integrity," that is, "barbarian spirit"? So, what Mr. Cao considers "unreliable" is precisely what Zheng "Prime Minister" takes pride in as "reliable," and what Lin "Master" admires as "reliable." Why is there such a difference in what each considers reliable? I think the answer should be sought from the knowledge itself, especially their living environment. At the same time, those intellectuals who have never been good, and therefore have no particular "corruption," need not be included in the lament.</p>
<p>Secondly, not all intellectuals are unreliable. Throughout history, many great leaders who emerged from mass movements were intellectuals. However, those who evade danger and betray friends for personal gain are often deliberately exaggerated and publicized, causing those with ulterior motives, like Mr. Cao, to shake their heads and sigh. As for the news of those who are unyielding, righteous, and generously sacrifice themselves, it is suppressed and stifled, so it cannot stimulate people's minds. At the same time, Mr. Cao's statement that they turned from "righteous indignation" to "selling themselves" only sees one side of intellectuals. On the other hand, there are also many intellectuals who turn from "selling themselves" to "righteous indignation." Of course, it is not easy for intellectuals to "serve society from beginning to end." Having come from "selling themselves" today, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not go back from "righteous indignation" tomorrow. The "drifting consciousness" of intellectuals is fostered by their drifting lives – drifting from work, from society, and from practice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Cao underestimates the May Fourth Movement because he is dissatisfied with the later "selling out" of student representatives. This is wrong. The value of the May Fourth Movement should be estimated from the social significance contained in the movement itself, from the role it played in history, and not entirely on the personal behavior of a few student representatives. The student movement was only one wing of the May Fourth Movement, and student representatives were only a small part of those who participated in the student movement. The "selling out" of student representatives, unless it directly betrays the movement and strikes a blow to it, will not reduce the role that the movement can play, and the value of the movement itself will not be diminished. Moreover, the "selling out" that Mr. Cao refers to is about later events; it is not sufficiently justified to presume that he was not "pure" at the time because he "sold out" later. Mr. Cao seems to believe in Huang Yuansheng very much. Because Huang Yuansheng was "without principles, without ideals, without integrity," he also lacked understanding. He confused the social role of the entire movement with personal actions, and used the method of generalizing from the particular to make wrong estimates of student movements or revolutions. There is no time to elaborate on this here. But didn't he clearly say: "During the imperial examination era, I had no thought of becoming an official. When overseas students were about to graduate, the thought of making a living and the so-called patriotic thought were intertwined in my mind" (quoted from Mr. Cao's original text)? It can be seen that even if a person later has the so-called "thought of making a living," the previous "no thought of becoming an official" can also be absolutely true. Of course, I don't want to defend the "selling out" elements, nor do I want to deliberately exaggerate the significance of the May Fourth Movement. If we can prove from the development process of a certain student representative that his "selling out" has some causal relationship with the May Fourth Movement, we can only say that the May Fourth Movement was originally just a social movement at a certain stage. When the social movement develops to a higher stage, the elements that originally participated in that movement cannot keep up with the progress of society, and then they decline. "Selling out" is just one of the manifestations of decline. It does not harm his original purity, nor does it harm the movement he participated in.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Cao said: "We ourselves should admit our mistakes like Huang Yuansheng, expose our own malignant syphilis, and not use nice words to cover it up!" This is very good. But it is only limited to the occasion of self-liquidation, as the beginning of a new direction. If one "admits mistakes" and is pessimistic, timid, and self-denying, then it will turn from "malignant syphilis" to incurable depression and cowardice. Nakedly "exposing one's own malignant syphilis" should be to bravely seek medical treatment. Otherwise, even if one does not hate the illness and commit suicide, there is nothing valuable about it. Moreover, since intellectuals are good at "using nice words to cover up," once the trend of "admitting mistakes" begins, who knows if someone will not use the good name of "admitting mistakes" to cover up themselves?</p>
<p>In short, it is well known that intellectuals are prone to wavering. However, believing that they will fatefully turn bad and giving them excessive contempt will only drive intellectuals into a dead end, which is also unnecessary.</p>
<h3>Singapore Port (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man raised his hand, gesturing for the old man to stand up.</p>
<p>The old man, still scrambling around, looked around, twitched the two wisps of his mustache, and asked:</p>
<p>"Are you talking nonsense? What good things would be here?"</p>
<p>"Pull it, who said here?" The pockmarked young man saw the old man had gone in, and quickly suppressed his laughter. "People are inviting you ashore to stroll around Chinatown, to eat at the Nan Tian Grand Restaurant!"</p>
<p>The old man saw the police guarding over there, and remembered he had been tricked again. His face reddened, and he cursed him with an ugly word.</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man, as if he hadn't had enough fun, straightened his waist towards the old man, patted his pocket, and shouted:</p>
<p>"What? Can't afford it?… There's plenty of money here!"</p>
<p>The old man showed a bitter smile, scratching his head as he said:</p>
<p>"Damn it, it's easy for you to talk pretty here. Go to the streets of Xiamen, then...try it."</p>
<p>His Burmese woman, though she didn't understand Chinese, could tell from their expressions that they were just joking around. She winked at the two children surrounding the lace curtain and nudged her lips towards the pockmarked young man. The two children, who loved to play with the pockmarked young man along the way, immediately ran over, grabbing his pockets one after the other, trying to snatch his money.</p>
<p>Just then, many people suddenly crowded towards the ship's railing (the side facing the sea), craning their necks to look down. The pockmarked young man pressed his pocket with his left hand, raised his right hand and waved, shouting, "Ha, ha, there, what? What? Go look," finally freeing himself.</p>
<p>"Miserly fellow!"</p>
<p>The old man cursed in dissatisfaction and finally squeezed over to look too.</p>
<p>It turned out that there were three or four Malays near the ship's side, wearing swimming trunks, bare-chested, each riding a very small boat, looking up at the white passengers standing by the first- and second-class cabins with smiling and pleading faces. One of them had just emerged from the light green sea, holding something he had picked up high above the water, making a show of it. Then, he put his hand to his ear and gave a grateful wave to the first- and second-class cabins. After a while, the white passengers in the first- and second-class cabins threw a shiny little thing into the sea. Immediately, two or three people paddling the boat dropped their oars and dived into the water like fish to grab it.</p>
<p>"What are they doing?"</p>
<p>The old man strained his eyes to look, nudging the person next to him with his elbow as he asked. The person wiped the sweat from his forehead, turned around and replied.</p>
<h3>Honorable Wife (7)</h3>
<p>— by Jiang Mashu, translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>"What, I am Japanese! Even if my son died in battle, I would not be surprised or cry. That would be shameful. In our Japan, many mothers whose beloved sons are killed by others believe that they died for the country and let go of everything. However, my son has not died, he is still alive. I received a letter not long ago. He is fighting bravely with the Russian devils. There is really nothing more worthy of congratulations than this! Ha, ha, ha..."</p>
<p>Then, she seemed to deliberately shake her whole body, laughing wildly.</p>
<p>The old woman often ran to my mother with a smile on her face and said:</p>
<p>"Madam, I'm sorry, please lend me the "cat skin" again. I've been thinking about all sorts of things, and I want to play the samisen again."</p>
<p>The so-called "cat skin" refers to the samisen. After my mother readily lent her the samisen, she took it to the workers' dormitory in the factory, sat in the empty, floored room, and immediately began to play. Naturally, the tune was chaotic, just a random strumming. She also sang loudly in a mess. Then, I don't know if it was because she couldn't restrain her joy, or because she found it funny to be doing such a thing, she would often open her toothless red mouth and laugh out loud...</p>
<p>"Oh dear, she's started acting crazy again." Although the people at home pitied her, they couldn't help but frown.</p>
<p>"Poor thing," my mother muttered to herself, hearing the demonic music and laughter that came into her ears, "If her son died in battle, she would really go crazy. Namo Amitabha, please protect her from such a thing!"</p>
<p>Contrary to initial expectations, Lushunkou was not so easy to capture. The attacks became more and more fierce, and the war increased the degree of tragedy. Every day, soldiers sent from our region to fight were killed in action. Those who were happy and celebrating amidst the joy of victory were probably only those who had not sent a single soldier from their own relatives. As for the families of the soldiers who had gone to war, their hearts were disturbed by uneasy terror when they heard the extra issue of the newspaper, when they opened the newspaper, and when they talked about the wind and snow of war.</p>
<p>The cooking old woman's son was still fighting safely. Not only that, but he had recently been promoted to lance corporal for his merits. The old woman was very proud.</p>
<p>"What's going on!" She smiled, wrinkling her nose. "It's still my son who is amazing! I prayed to the gods and Buddhas, and thanks to the gods and Buddhas, my son didn't die, and he was even promoted to lance corporal. He's doing a great job. Maybe he won't die and will become a general and come back with a shiny golden rooster medal. Long live, long live!"</p>
<h3>Ancient City</h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>Moved again.</p>
<p>I really live under the old city wall. As long as I make a turn, I can see the gray city wall in the gray alley. When a gust of wind passes, it drags up a large cloud of smoke, covering my eyes as if they are separated by many layers of gauze.</p>
<p>I have seen tourists who have traveled here elsewhere. In their piles of photos, you can always find one or two photos of the city tower of this ancient city without disappointing you. It is so huge and so majestic that people cannot help but be suffocated by the oriental architecture and exclaim in admiration. How many people have constructed beautiful and magical dreams for this ancient city.</p>
<p>However, what a medieval decay is shown in front of me!</p>
<p>Scattered, broken, dull...</p>
<p>Because of the collapse, most of the steps beside the city gate are hung with signs that say "No Climbing". Or is there any deeper meaning besides preventing tourists from danger? But people can still find a path trodden by people over the years and sneak up. From there, you can see the spectacle of Peiping City! — Red walls, yellow tiles, and some newly built gray walls and green tiles, and in the distance, the mountains are buried in the clouds. Unfortunately, there are not so many vast rivers here. Even the one at the foot of the city is as thin as a ribbon. When it is hot and dry, a burst of stench will open with the wind, which will make people from water towns curse fiercely. Besides the inspectors and naughty tourists, those who come to the city head are the firm city dwellers who want to throw their lives down here. This has become news that is not new in people's ears.</p>
<p>Large vehicles are prohibited from passing on the asphalt road, so most of them have to pass through small alleys or walk around the city. The paths of heavy livestock and wheels are deeply stepped on in the thick soil. "People grow up from the soil," this sentence may not be wrong. Camel teams often pass by here too. The ancient city, the camel bells, don't they give people who breathe in dreams some longing?</p>
<p>It seems that there are few high-ranking families under the city gate. Which gentleman or young lady is willing to eat ashes here! Here, only dilapidated corpses or small houses that have never been raised are gathered together. The children squat on the ground all year round to play with mud, draw little people and little horses on the city walls, pick wildflowers that protrude from the brick cracks, and pick some wild jujubes in autumn. The children grow up with tears, laughter, words and curses.</p>
<p>At the foot of the city gate, there are always a few traces of yellow earth and new bricks on both sides, like stamps on envelopes stuck there. That was a defensive work during the incident four years ago. Trenches were dug and anti-aircraft guns were prepared to be erected there.</p>
<p>Walking out of the city, there are always small market-like stalls and vendors. The rickshaw pullers stand there eating enema and drinking hot soup. The barriers of the railway crossing are opened and closed again according to the time. The people and vehicles coming and going temporarily stop, watching the long train and the dusty faces revealed in the train windows.</p>
<p>Living at the foot of this city wall, the roar of the train when it passes by every day is the most moving music. What does it evoke and what does it take away.</p>
<h3>Sunlight in Memory</h3>
<p>— Wu Rangsan</p>
<p>At this time, I lived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It's not a very good place. And the weather is bad, and my house is very bad. The sky is a chaotic lead-blue color, and the blurred clouds are kneaded into some ugly faces. It is always so ambiguous, swollen, and layer upon layer of gray is added, and it becomes more and more calm and sinister.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a few days a year, a powerless tube of sunlight will leak from the corner of the window, obliquely inserted on the wall or the yellow table painted with shellac, which is my greatest comfort. If not, if a person doesn't have sunlight even once a year, I don't think I can survive.</p>
<p>I jumped up and kissed it with my lips. It's like I've lost everything, and this is my only last possession. I put down everything else. Sleeping on the table, or leaning against the wall, closing my eyes, I faced it with my face, trying to draw it into my breath as much as possible. …Using a mirror to do the old trick. Carefully, patiently, bring the sunlight to every corner of the room, and get the satisfaction of burning something for real. Sometimes use a basin of water. Sometimes block it with your palm, and hide under your palm. …In short. Get my happiness in various ways. …</p>
<p>I used to have inexhaustible sunlight. I have never lived in a university, but piecing together those fragmented, intermittent elementary and middle school lives can also make up six or seven academic years. — The brilliant sunlight endlessly shines on my days.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I didn't cherish it at that time, and I didn't know what interest it would have in me. In the field, in the playground, in the corridor, I picked it up casually, and threw it away casually.</p>
<p>Now, I am very stingy in using it! Sometimes when I suddenly open my eyes to it, it stings me, and tears flow down. At this time, when I close my eyes, I think of the fact that I didn't know how to cherish it before.</p>
<p>I am not using sunlight to symbolize youth or anything else, that doesn't make much sense. For example, for youth, I think it can be borrowed from the power of true art to make it undiminished and exist more vigorously.</p>
<p>I just like to let it sting me, shed tears, and close my eyes, that kind of real happiness.</p>
<p>— by Huang Shiying</p>
<p>Father: May you bless my two children to enter heaven safely!</p>

<h3>National Games Day 5: Shanghai Firmly Wins Three Track and Field Championships for Men and Women; Pole Vault and Women's Javelin Set New National Records; Track and Field Ends Today; All-Around Swimming Begins Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of the National Games. In the men's and women's track and field events, Shanghai's Fu Baolu broke his own national record in the men's pole vault with an exceptional performance of 3.9 meters. The next five athletes also performed extremely well, making it the best harvest of the Games in five days. In the women's javelin throw, Henan's Yuan Hengrui also broke the national record, but it was not as good as ideal. There is no doubt that the three track and field championships for men and women have been firmly secured by Shanghai. The men's and women's track and field events will end today, and the all-around and swimming events will begin tomorrow. The situation in the ball games is becoming increasingly tense, and most have reached the semi-finals, which will be a time of close combat.</p>
<h3>Most Fruitful Harvest in Athletics: Fu Bao-Lu's Triumphant Masterpiece; 3.90 Meters Breaks National Record; Runner-Up Wang He Achieves 3.85 Meters, Also Equaling Fu Bao-Lu's National Record</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Games, all athletic events have been completed, but none were truly satisfying. Only yesterday's pole vault can be considered the most fruitful harvest of the Games. The champion was still Fu Bao-Lu, the champion of the fourth and fifth editions, with a result of 3.90 meters, approaching the Far Eastern record. The second-place finisher, Wang He, also reached 3.85 meters, equaling the national record. The results of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth places were also extremely excellent, all exceeding our expectations. The details of the final competition are recorded below:</p>
<p>Abundant Talent Exceeds Expectations</p>
<p>The competition started at 1:00 PM yesterday and concluded at 6:00 PM. A total of 20 people cleared 3 meters. When the bar was raised to 3.30 meters, 10 people cleared it, including Wu Jing-Shun and Ma Si-Guang from Guangdong; Wang He, Fu Bao-Lu, and Wei Zhi-Ping from Shanghai; Huang Bo-Gang from Jiangxi; Zhang Yu-Chang from Liaoning; Xu Ran-Pan and Chen Yi-Jing from Malaya; and Cai Zi-Xian from Fujian. When the bar was raised to 3.45 meters, Zhang, Huang, Chen, and Cai all failed to clear it, while the others cleared it. When the bar was raised to 3.55 meters, Fu Bao-Lu, Wang He, Ma De-Guang, and Huang Bo-Gang all cleared it, but Wei Zhi-Ping and Wu Jing-Shun failed to clear it. Wei and Wu then jumped again to determine fifth and sixth place, with Wei winning fifth and Wu getting sixth.</p>
<p>Fu and Wang Compete, Performance is Splendid</p>
<p>Then the bar was raised to 3.75 meters. Wang He cleared it with one jump, and Fu Bao-Lu responded in kind, also clearing it with one jump. Ma De-Guang and Huang Bo-Gang failed to clear it. Thus, the two men repeatedly raised and lowered the bar to determine the order. In the end, Huang lost to Ma and got fourth place, while Ma, with the same result, ranked third. Note that Huang Bo-Gang is Huang Yi. He won fourth place in the pole vault at the previous Games. When the bar was raised to 3.85 meters, Fu Bao-Lu cleared it with one jump, and Wang He cleared it with two jumps. The whole stadium erupted in applause, knowing that the national record was sure to be broken. When the bar was raised to 3.90 meters, Wang He jumped first but failed to clear it. Fu also failed to clear it. Then Wang He tried two more jumps but failed, so he was eliminated. Although Fu's great enemy had left, he only had one more chance. At this time, the veteran athlete Feng Jian-Wei was on the field, giving Fu Bao-Lu a massage. After Fu warmed up on the field, his spirits suddenly lifted. He lightly cleared 3.90 meters.</p>

<p>Attempting to Break the Far Eastern Record, Failing by a Hair's Breadth</p>
<p>After that, the referees raised the height of the bar to 4.01 meters. The Far Eastern record is 4.00 meters exactly, and the result of the 10th Far Eastern Games was 3.905 meters. If Mr. Fu could clear 4.01 meters, then the Far Eastern record would be broken. When Fu attempted to jump 4.01 meters, he was able to clear it three times, but unfortunately, his hand made a slight contact with the bar, causing it to fall. Thus, this long-cherished wish was not fulfilled.</p>
<p>Average Results are Wonderful and Impressive</p>
<p>Fu's victory over Wang yesterday was partly due to his strategy. Before the competition, Fu announced that he would not participate and claimed that he had not practiced for two months, cleverly deceiving Wang He. Wang thought he was triumphant but did not expect Fu to achieve this result, leading to his defeat due to underestimating his opponent. The full results are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Fu Bao-Lu (Shanghai) 3.90 meters (New National Record)</p>
<p>(2) Wang He (Shanghai) 3.85 meters (Tied National Record)</p>
<p>(3) Ma De-Guang (Guangdong) 3.55 meters</p>
<p>(4) Huang Bo-Gang (Jiangxi) 3.55 meters</p>
<p>(5) Wei Zhi-Ping (Shanghai) 3.45 meters</p>
<p>(6) Wu Jing-Shun (Guangdong) 3.45 meters</p>
<p>"Eliminated List: Zhang Yu-Chang 3.30 meters, Xu Ran-Pan 3.30 meters, Chen Yi-Jing 3.30 meters, Cai Zi-Xian 3.30 meters"</p>

<p>Women's Javelin Overwhelms Pan Ying-Chu; Yuan Heng-Rui Breaks Record; 28.55 Meters Not Ideal; First Time Both Top Two Break National Record</p>
<p>The women's javelin event, where Shanghai's Pan Ying-Chu and Qian Hang-Su usually score above 32 meters, was won yesterday by Miss Yuan Heng-Rui from Henan. Yesterday, the headwind affected the results considerably. A total of 22 people participated in the competition. In the preliminary round, Pan Ying-Chu led with a result of approximately 25 meters, approaching the national record. Then Yuan Heng-Rui from Henan, Xu Yuan from Shanghai, Qian Hang-Su, Yan Xiu-Rong from Guangdong, and Li Yu-Tao from Malaya were all very close. In the second trial, Miss Li secured second place, and Hu Wen-Lan from Hebei also secured a spot by exceeding 20 meters. By the third throw, the six finalists were determined: Deng Qing, Xu Yuan, Pan Ying-Chu, Li Yu-Tao, Qian Hang-Su, and Yuan Heng-Rui. In the final, Pan threw with all her might when the wind calmed down, breaking the national record with approximately 28 meters and taking the lead, displaying excellent form. In the last throw, Ms. Yuan surpassed her even more with 28 and a half meters, leaping to the championship. The other results also improved, and the order also changed. It ended at 2:30 PM, and Zhang Bo-Ling presented the awards. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Yuan Heng-Rui (Henan) 28.55 meters, breaking the national and Games records</p>
<p>(2) Pan Ying-Chu (Shanghai) 28.21 meters, breaking the national and Games records</p>
<p>(3) Xu Yuan (Shanghai) 27.41 meters</p>
<p>(4) Li Qing (Zhejiang) 26.895 meters</p>
<p>(5) Qian Hang-Su (Shanghai) 25.76 meters</p>
<p>(6) Li Yu-Tao (Malaya) 25.74 meters</p>
<h3>1500 Meter Final: Jia Lian-Ren Wins Championship; Shanghai City Sweeps Top Three; Result is Four Minutes and Twenty-Three Seconds Point Two; Gu De-Sheng Ranks Fourth</h3>
<p>The men's 1500-meter final was filled with talented athletes and intense competition. Eighteen people started, with Jin Li-Deng leading, followed by Jia Lian-Ren, and then Qiu Cheng-Zhong and Wang Zheng-Lin. When running to 700 meters, Jia advanced to first place, while Qiu and Wang closely followed, not willing to give up an inch. At one point, Wang Zheng-Lin advanced to first place, but Jia chased him back. When running to 1200 meters, Jia Lian-Ren steadily increased his pace, Wang Zheng-Lin fell behind by five meters, Qiu was one meter behind Wang, and Gu was one meter behind Qiu. There were no changes until the end. Cao Yan-You, with a final sprint of two meters, gained a precious second place. Wu Wen-Lin came in sixth. Wang Hui-Bin, Jin Zhong-Kang, and others were all eliminated, and their results were mediocre.</p>
<p>First Place: Jia Yun-Ren (Shanghai) Four minutes and twenty-three seconds point two</p>
<p>Second Place: Wang Zheng-Lin (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Third Place: Qiu Zhong-Cheng (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Gu De-Sheng (Shanxi)</p>
<p>Fifth Place: Cao Yan-You (Weihai)</p>
<p>Sixth Place: Wu Wen-Lin (Hebei)</p>
<h3>Women's 4x100 Meter Relay Preliminary: Ties National Record; Shanghai Team 54.6 Seconds</h3>
<p>The last scene of yesterday afternoon's athletics competition was the women's 4x100 meter relay preliminary, divided into two groups. In the first group, the Shanghai and Malayan teams met. Shanghai was in the inner lane. Li Sen ran the first leg and was in first place from the starting point to 50 meters. Chen Bai-Xue's baton exchange was not good, falling behind, but she quickly caught up. Jiao Yu-Lian and Qian Hang-Su ran the third and fourth legs respectively, maintaining the lead. As a result, the first team finished about 20 meters ahead of the second. Second place was Malaya, third place was Beiping, and fourth place was Henan. The result was 54.6 seconds, tying the national record. In the second group, the first was Guangdong, the second was Qingdao, the third was Fujian, and the fourth was Jiangsu. The result was 55.3 seconds.</p>

<h3>Today's Finals Predictions: 10,000 Meters Highly Watchable; National Masters Recalculate Old Scores; Shanxi's Four Generals Worth Attention</h3>
<p>Today's 10,000-meter final is sure to be a grand occasion. The participants include Gu De-Sheng, Chen Shu-Sen, and Li Deng-Gui from Shanxi; Niu Hong-Quan and Li Hui from Shandong; Wang Zheng-Lin, Zhang Liang, Jin Kang, and He Bao-Shan from Shanghai. Based on past results, Shanxi's four runners have a good chance of sweeping the top four places. Shanghai's Wang Zheng-Lin should be able to make the cut. The winning time should be around 33 or 34 minutes. Gu De-Sheng is the favorite to win. Recalling two years ago, at the Fifth Games held in Nanjing, the 10,000-meter final caused a negotiation issue, and Gu De-Sheng and Jin Jian-Kang became famous. This year, Shanxi has a complete team, and Jiangsu's Jin Zhong-Kang is still healthy. Many of the participants also attended the previous Games. Recalculating old scores is quite intriguing.</p>
<p>Li and Qian Hopeful in Women's 200 Meters</p>
<p>Today's women's 200-meter final will include Li Sen, Qian Hang-Su, Jiao Yu-Lian, Wu Xin-Ju, Tang Qi-Zhen, Deng Yin-Jiao, Chen Keng, Xu Mei-Ying, and Wan Yu-Lian. Based on strength, Li Sen is the most promising, followed by Qian Hang-Su and Deng Yin-Jiao, and then Chen Keng and Jiao Yu-Lian. The result should be around 28 seconds, and it may not be easy to break the national record. Also, Miss Jiao Yu-Lian from Henan, who previously held the national record, has surprisingly declined. In the 100 meters, she only ranked fifth. Jiao has also performed well in the 200 meters in the past at the North China Games. Since coming to Shanghai to study at the East Asia Sports College, her results have deteriorated. It is hoped that she will work harder in the future.</p>
<p>Wang Shi-Lin Ill for Triple Jump</p>
<p>Wang Shi-Lin from Beiping is ill and unable to participate in the high jump and long jump. Zhang Jia from Shanghai is more reliable in this event, with a strength of nearly 14 meters. In the Shanghai National Games, he jumped 13.90 meters. Yang Dao-Gui from Nanjing jumped 14.15 meters at the Qingdao summer training camp, and Wang Sen's result at the Beiping Spring Games was 14.18 meters. If Wang participates today, he may still be able to secure a spot; otherwise, the triple jump will be a stage for the competition between Yang and Zhang.</p>
<p>Everyone Says They Are Tired in the 400 Meters</p>
<p>The men's 400-meter final was predicted to produce a national record before the competition because the results of Dong Shu-Zhao, Dai Shu-Guo, and Fu Jin-Cheng are all very impressive. The correspondent met the athletes participating in the 400 meters yesterday and asked for their opinions. They all said they were exhausted and unlikely to achieve good results. Dong Shu-Zhao's participation yesterday was indeed forced because he exerted a lot of effort in the 800-meter competition with Li Shi-Ming the day before, and Li also withdrew from the 400 meters. Fu Jin-Cheng has participated in the finals, repechages, semi-finals, and preliminaries of the 100, 200, and 400 meters, a total of ten times. Dai Shu-Guo has also participated in the finals, semi-finals, repechages, and preliminaries of the 200 and 400 meters. Considering the fatigue levels of the athletes, breaking the national record is likely as difficult as reaching the sky.</p>
<p>New Record in Women's Softball Throw</p>
<p>The national record for women's softball throw will definitely be shattered. The Games record and national record of 45.35 meters will be exceeded by all of the top six. Shanghai's Liang Yun-Sen's result is over 51 meters. Others such as Yuan Heng-Rui from Henan, Yan Xiu-Rong from Guangdong, and Chen Rong-Tang from Shanghai all have results above 45 meters.</p>
<p>Shanghai Has No Problem in Women's Relay</p>
<p>In the women's relay race, the Shanghai team, with Li Sen, Qian Hang-Su, Jiao Yu-Lian, Peng Ai-Pu, and a Westerner participating, is unstoppable. Winning the championship is no problem. Second place will be the Malayan team, and third place will be the Guangdong team. Beiping, Qingdao, Fujian, and Jiangsu will compete for fourth, fifth, and sixth places.</p>
<p>Reporter Badges Valid in All Venues</p>
<p>According to the All-China Games Publicity Team, this year's Games have benefited from the assistance of local and nationwide newspaper reporters, making many aspects of the Games' publicity more convenient. They are deeply grateful. However, they hope to be forgiven for any shortcomings in hospitality. If reporters specially sent by newspapers from various regions to cover the Games have any difficulties due to unfamiliarity with the area or people, they can contact the publicity team at any time, who will sincerely provide assistance. The Games reporter badge, originally only applicable to the athletics field, can now be used in all venues for the convenience of reporters.</p>

<h3>Protests from the Sichuan Team Regarding Doubts in the Pingchuan Soccer Game; Protest Withdrawn After Explanation; No Rest During Extra Time; National Arts Records Verified and Signed This Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning's Pingchuan soccer game saw Beijing defeat Sichuan 4-3. The situation was very even and tense. At the end of regulation, the score was tied 2-2. During the 30-minute overtime, the Beijing team scored two goals, while Sichuan only managed to score one. As a result, Beijing eliminated Sichuan with a score of 4-3. After the game, the Sichuan team's leader and coaches protested to the judging committee, claiming that the referee, Lü Changfu, had only counted 27 minutes of the 30-minute overtime, shorting them three minutes, which would have given Sichuan a greater chance to tie the game. The judging committee held a meeting at the gymnasium last night to discuss the Sichuan team's protest. Eleven judges were present, as well as the soccer referee Lü Changfu, two linesmen, and the Sichuan team leader Liu Mianzhi. Regarding the Sichuan team's points, after the referee's explanation, Mr. Liu from the Sichuan team had no objections. Later, Wang Zhengting proposed and Zhang Boling seconded a motion to return the protest letter and deposit to the Sichuan team, as the Sichuan team's protest was actually a request for an explanation from the organizing committee, which was commendable. Thus, the protest ended peacefully. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan Team's Protest Content The Sichuan team leader's protest letter was divided into two parts: soccer, and national arts and archery. Each part was further divided into two points. Regarding soccer: (1) The Sichuan team stated that when the game was about to end, with the score tied 2-2, the referee suddenly blew the whistle to stop the game while the Sichuan team was attacking, causing them to lose a scoring opportunity. (2) In the 30-minute overtime, only 27 minutes were played. Although the score was 4-3, the Beijing team was exhausted, and the Sichuan team had a great chance to tie the game. Regarding national arts, they stated that there were errors in the referee's records and requested an explanation.</p>
<p>Soccer Referee's Explanation During the meeting, after the Sichuan team leader presented their case, the chairman, Chen Boling, asked the soccer referee Lü Changfu to respond. Mr. Lü's explanation was as follows: (1) Regarding the unexplained whistle to stop the game, the Sichuan team did not specify which instance they were referring to. In the final minute, the whistle was blown several times. Therefore, this point could not be answered. Based on the facts, the referee would not have blown the whistle without a valid reason. (2) Regarding the three-minute shortage in overtime, Lü explained that according to the rules, there is a 15-minute break between the two 10-minute halves of overtime, and the game is to continue. There is no rest in between. The Sichuan players took a brief rest outside the line at -5 minutes, so the Sichuan team's timing may have mistakenly deducted this rest time. Regarding the national arts portion, it was decided that Chairman Zhang Boling would review the records this morning and provide an answer, which was not expected to be a problem.</p>
<p>Result: Protest Withdrawn After this explanation, Mr. Liu from the Sichuan team stated that the Sichuan team's participation in the Games was not for the sake of winning or losing, but to observe and learn. The protest was merely to draw the organizing committee's attention to and explain the doubts that arose during the game. Therefore, they did not insist on it. Committee member Wang Zhengting then stated that, based on Mr. Liu's previous statements, the entire purpose was to support the Games, not to protest. Now that the explanation was clear, he proposed returning the deposit. Zhang Boling seconded the motion, and the protest letter was returned as well. The meeting adjourned with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Sichuan's Two Protest Letters The Sichuan team leader stated that because the province's soccer team's game against the Beijing soccer team on the morning of the 14th (yesterday) had an unfulfilled overtime and the referee announced the result, they had submitted two protest letters to the organizing committee's judging committee for a public decision. The two protest letters from the team are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) To the esteemed organizing committee: Today (the 14th), in the morning, the result of our team's soccer game against the Beijing soccer team, according to the organizing committee's report, was 4-3 in favor of Beijing. Our team has two doubts about this game, which are specifically listed on the left: (1) In the second half, when the score was tied 2-2, our team passed the ball into the Beijing team's penalty area, where the defense was very weak, which was very advantageous for our team. There were no fouls or other violations. The referee suddenly blew the whistle to stop the game, giving the Beijing team a good opportunity to wait for reinforcements. The referee then announced the continuation of the game, which greatly affected our team. We request the organizing committee's response. (2) At the end of the second half, the result was 2-2. According to the regulations, there should be a 30-minute overtime. During the overtime, the Beijing team scored two goals, and our team scored one goal, making the score 4-3. In the second half of the overtime, with only 12 minutes elapsed, our team was working hard in the Beijing area and was in a very advantageous position when the referee blew the whistle to announce the end. According to our team leader Liu Shenzhi, who was west of the command platform, soccer coach Deng Deguang, who was at the entrance to the east command platform, and manager Chang Huangxixia, who was in the stands, all timed it and stated that only 12 minutes had elapsed. At that time, our team leader Liu Shenzhi and coach Deng Deguang made verbal protests to the referee, who said that we could report it directly to the organizing committee. We are now submitting the above two reasons, in accordance with Article 21 of the competition regulations, and paying a deposit of ten yuan to the organizing committee within one hour to lodge a protest. We respectfully request a public decision. Addressed to the judging committee.</p>
<p>(2) To the esteemed organizing committee: Our team's archery athlete Liu Yongxi participated in the long-distance archery competition at 1:00 PM today. After the finals, Liu Yongxi's score was 105.05 meters. The referee recorded it as sixth place. Later, due to a proposal from the Henan team leader, a certain athlete's score in the preliminary round was 105.47 meters, but in the finals, it was more than ten meters less than Liu Yongxi's score (Liu Yongxi once had a record of 108.3 meters). The Henan team leader insisted on using the preliminary round score instead of the finals score, so the certain athlete was ranked sixth, and our team's Liu Yongxi was canceled. At that time, our team's athlete Liu Yongxi made a verbal protest to the referee, Mr. Zhang Weizhong, who reported it to the head of the national defense referees, Mr. Chu Minyi. Mr. Chu's response was not very satisfactory and was disappointing. We are now submitting this written protest and respectfully request the organizing committee to make a decision. Addressed to the judging committee.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Crushes Anhui 19-0; Beijing Barely Defeats Sichuan 4-3 in Overtime</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were two soccer games. At 9:00 AM, Beijing played Sichuan, with evenly matched strengths, resulting in a fierce battle and a 2-2 tie. After a 30-minute overtime, Beijing narrowly won with a score of 4-3. At 4:00 PM, Hong Kong played Anhui. The Hong Kong team, led by soccer king Li Huitang, was extremely strong and defeated the Anhui team 19-0. This is the victory record of this year's Games' soccer tournament.</p>
<h3>Beijing Defeats Sichuan; Wins by One Goal in Overtime</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00, the soccer game between Beijing and Sichuan saw equally matched teams engage in intense close combat. In the first half, the Sichuan team faced a headwind, making the ball difficult to control. After a long and hard-fought battle, neither side could gain the upper hand. After half an hour, the Beijing team's offense gradually weakened, and Sichuan's center-back Shi Zhaode seized the opportunity to advance, passing the ball to right-winger Zhou Tailin. The inside defenders were unable to intercept, and Zhou kicked the ball into the net. The Beijing team launched a full-line counterattack, but after a long melee, they achieved nothing. Sichuan won the first half with one goal.</p>
<p>In the second half, the teams switched sides, and the Sichuan team had the upper hand, with the momentum in their favor. The Beijing team was cautious and defended tightly. After about twenty minutes of close combat, neither side scored. Before long, the Beijing right-winger dribbled the ball and advanced, breaking through the defenders and passing the ball to the center in front of the goal. Center-forward Lian Qiexun rushed up and kicked the ball, making the score 1-1. The score was evened. Soon, the Sichuan team scored another goal. In the last few minutes, the Beijing center-back desperately broke through the enemy's camp, scoring a valuable point and making the score 2-2 again. The second half suddenly ended.</p>
<p>The referee announced a 30-minute overtime. Only a few minutes after the restart, the Sichuan team lost two goals in a row. The teams switched fields again after 15 minutes, and the Sichuan team worked hard to counterattack. In the last five minutes, right-winger Zhou Tailin scored a goal. The game ended with the sound of the whistle. The total score was 4-3, with victory belonging to Beijing.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Sweeps Anhui; Sets New Record of 19-0</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 4:00 PM, Hong Kong played Anhui. The Hong Kong team was the strongest team in this year's soccer tournament. The forward line was led by soccer king Li Huitang, with left and right wingers Zheng Jiliang and Cao Guicheng charging into battle. Bao Jiaping guarded the goal. They could attack and defend with the best lineup to face the inexperienced Anhui team. They defeated the Anhui team 19-0, setting a new record for goals scored in this year's tournament. The Hong Kong team played with a very relaxed style, and the quality of their play was excellent. Soccer king Li Huitang's footwork and shooting posture were truly captivating and inspiring for the audience. It was especially commendable that he scored eight goals independently. The battle conditions between the two armies are as follows:</p>
<p>The Might of the Soccer King After the kickoff, the soccer king led the army to attack. The disparity in strength between Hong Kong and Anhui made it difficult to resist. The Hong Kong team's three forwards shot many times, hitting the goalposts or being blocked by the goalkeeper at least four or five times. Ten minutes later, the soccer king scored two goals in quick succession. Zhuo Shijin led the uprising and continued to contribute. Zheng Jiliang launched an attack from the wing, scoring another goal. After a brief melee, the soccer king displayed his magical skills again, playing with the Anhui defense as if it were in the palm of his hand, scoring two goals lightly within the defender's area. Shen Tingkun could only watch helplessly as the ball entered the net. Before long, Li Zhaorong sneaked into the Anhui army's restricted area and scored another goal. The Hong Kong team played effortlessly, taking a 7-0 lead. Later, although they had a penalty kick, the soccer king lightly tapped the ball, allowing Shen Tingkun to catch it with ease. The first half ended happily.</p>
<p>Another Beatdown After the break, the teams engaged in close combat. Li Zhaorong continued to intimidate the Anhui team. Li Guowei, although serving as a midfielder, also sent a goal from afar. Zheng Jiliang made another great contribution, and the ball seemed to come to life, also scoring a goal. Before long, Li Zhaorong and Huang Meishun scored again, hitting the mark. The soccer king became excited and scored again. Zhuo Shijin and Huang Meishun followed. The speed of scoring goals was unmatched. Five minutes before the end of the game, the soccer king scored another goal. The score in the second half was 12-0, making the total score 19-0. The Hong Kong team won a great victory. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Yu Qingyuan, Liang Xianzan, Li Guowei, Huang Meishun, Liang Rongzhao, Zheng Jiliang, Zhuo Shijin, Li Huitang, Li Zhaorong, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Anhui Team</p>

<h3>Soccer Championship Situation</h3>
<p>Men's Tennis</p>
<h3>Men's Doubles Advances to the Quarterfinals; Shanghai, Malaysia, Java, and Sichuan Advance to the Quarterfinals; Yesterday, Shanghai Barely Defeats Guangdong 3-2</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the men's tennis doubles semifinals were held. According to the rules, the best of five sets would determine the winner. Good players from Java, Malaysia, Shanghai, and other places attended. The main event was the match between Shanghai and Guangdong. Initially, the audience was concentrated on the Xu Chengji brothers' match against Hebei, but because it was one-sided, there was little interest. Soon, everyone gathered to watch the Shanghai-Guangdong match. Shanghai fielded Lin Qiu, the strongest doubles combination. However, Xu Runpei and Li Guangjun from Guangdong had excellent cooperation, and their net play and overheads were excellent, posing a significant threat to Lin Qiu. After a fierce five-set battle, the winner was decided. The performance was exceptionally brilliant and rare. In the end, Shanghai, Java, Sichuan, and Malaysia secured the right to advance to the quarterfinals. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Fierce Battle Process Unfavorable Start</p>
<p>Lin Qiu were clumsy and got off to an unfavorable start, falling behind 2-4. Seeing that the situation was not good, they quickly caught up. Lin won his serve, while Li Guangjun made three double faults to give the guests points, tying the score at 4-4. However, after that, Lin Qiu repeatedly made mistakes at critical moments in a winnable situation. In the next game, they won three points in a row, but then lost five points in a row, losing the game. A winnable game turned into a loss, and the situation changed drastically. Xu Li continued to win his serve, taking the lead 6-4.</p>
<p>Wonderful Performance</p>
<p>In the second set, Lin Qiu fought back and played even better, especially as Qiu Youhai gradually got into top form. As a result, they used a two-pronged approach, creating a strong momentum. Li Guangjun and Xu Runpei ran and returned the ball, unwilling to show weakness, competing fiercely. The performance became even more exciting, winning continuous applause. At 2-2 and 3-3, Lin Qiu showed their teamwork and dealt with the situation with all their strength, winning two games in a row, taking a 5-3 lead. The two sides fought for victory in terms of skill and intelligence, which was truly miraculous. Lin then won his serve, winning 6-3.</p>
<p>Winning Two Sets in a Row</p>
<p>In the next set, both sides maintained a strong attacking interest, which was still very strong. Lin Qiu's cooperation was skillful and their net play was incredibly skillful, but their opponents were not afraid to run. They could return balls over the net that others thought were hopeless. Lin Qiu did not relax at all, attacking from both sides and quickly getting four games. In the following few games, Guangdong won two games, but eventually lost again 2-6. Shanghai led 2-1.</p>
<p>Evening Out the Odds</p>
<p>After a break, Guangdong won two games in a row, showing an upward trend. Lin Qiu was unwilling to give in and immediately returned two games. In the fourth game, Qiu Youhai returned a ball from the baseline, hitting the head of a ball boy standing by the net post. The referee immediately ruled that Shanghai lost a point. Lin Qiu both believed that this ball, if it had passed, would have been a good ball. At the same time, Li Guangjun of Guangdong immediately argued that even if this ball had passed the net, it would have been out of bounds. The referee could not make a decision for a while, but after reviewing the line, he still ruled it a good ball. After 3-3, Lin Qiu failed again in depression, losing 3-6. The victory or defeat had to be resolved in the fifth set.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Tennis Singles Match: Lin Baohua (right), Xu Runpei (left)</p>
<p>Final Victory</p>
<p>At the beginning of the final, Li Xu's lineup was chaotic, and they repeatedly made mistakes by giving way to each other. Lin Qiu was determined to win, and he would not relax a step. The time was connected to the third level, taking a distant lead. After that, in a lifeless state, they went from 4-1 to 4-2, and then to 5-2. Li Xu attempted a final struggle, and the audience suddenly cheered up, but the tide could not be turned, and Shanghai won the final victory 6-3.</p>
<p>Sichuan Eliminates Nanjing</p>
<p>The Sichuan-Nanjing game lacked energy. Ma Shaobo and Liang Deguang from Nanjing were as quiet as virgins and lacked offensive spirit. They were calm and composed, and Wang Wenzheng and Qian Yaobin could not easily win. In the third set, Nanjing managed to win a set. In the fourth set, both sides attacked with soft balls, which was difficult to resolve. The situation was very even. As a result, Sichuan eliminated Nanjing 3-1.</p>
<p>Java Takes It All</p>
<p>The strength disparity between Xu Chengji and Xu Chengwei of Java and Zheng Bogu and Li Dinggu of Hebei was obvious. The Xu brothers did not demand too much, and easily won 6-2. There was a fierce competition in the second set. Xu won three games first, and Zheng Li tried hard to counterattack, making it 4-3 and then 5-4. Xu then won again 6-4. In the third set, the situation became worse and worse. Zheng Li only won one game. Straight sets, Java eliminated Hebei.</p>
<p>Malaysia Has Great Strength</p>
<p>The Beijing Zaixiao Chao Luo Xiaojian brothers' doubles team once claimed that they hoped to win the National Games championship. Their words were still youthful, but their performance yesterday was indeed impressive. Unfortunately, they encountered Ma Biling Wang Su Ruan Guoying, and under strong pressure, they had no chance to survive, losing three sets in a row. Lin Ruan's doubles team had a tight combination and was a strong enemy of Shanghai. Next week in the quarterfinals, they will meet on a narrow road. It is unknown who will win.</p>
<p>Men's Doubles Situation</p>
<h3>Men's Singles Competition: Second Round Concludes Today, Yesterday's Four Matches, Four More Today</h3>
<p>Men's tennis has entered a tense phase. The third week of singles matches saw four matches yesterday, and all will conclude today. Those who have already secured a spot in the semi-quarterfinals are Shanghai's Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai, and Chuan Wang Wenzheng, Qian Yaobin. They will compete tomorrow with today's winners for a place in the quarterfinals. The tennis courtside is expected to be packed with people, becoming extremely crowded.</p>
<p>Yesterday's four singles matches began at 1 p.m. The matches in each group were extremely exciting, drawing a large audience. Veterans Lin and Qiu displayed their prowess, undiminished from their past, while rising stars Xu and Li also showed exceptional talent. Wang Wenzheng's skills are improving daily; he is among the best players. His forehand shot is like a thunderbolt. Even Xu Ji would pale in comparison. The remaining players are all second-tier, possessing considerable skill, and with time, they can certainly be developed. Yesterday's results saw a complete victory for Shanghai, with the scores as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Baohua</p>
<p>The match between Lin and Xu opened the day. Although Xu Runpei was prepared to lose, his spirited resistance was commendable. Lin Baohua was confident and composed. From the start, Lin Baohua shone brightly, launching a fierce attack on young Xu, winning five consecutive games. Xu fought back desperately, winning two games, but it was a fleeting moment of glory. Lin won the next game, ending the first set 6-2. From the second set onward, Lin, riding the momentum of his victory, was in full form. His shots and net play were nearly flawless. Xu tried his best to cope, but to no avail. Lin took a commanding lead of 3-0. Xu then changed his strategy, attacking the net, which proved immediately successful, winning a game. However, it was a pyrrhic victory. Lin feinted and changed his position, sometimes far, sometimes near, leaving Xu exhausted and forced to concede defeat. Lin won the set 6-1.</p>

<p>Qiu Feihai</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai is aging and his skills are declining, but with long experience on the court, he remains seasoned. Li Guangjun, a Guangdong athlete, is excellent at smashing and cutting, but his temper is too quick, and he lacks patience. At the start of the match, Li, facing a strong opponent, was unusually flustered, hitting weak shots and lacking control. Qiu attacked with full force, relentlessly, hitting long shots deep into both corners, and had an easy time, winning six consecutive games. When the second set began, Qiu was already exhausted, while Li gradually regained his composure, determined to take revenge. As a result, the situation became even, and the competition was fierce. They tied at one game each, then two games each. Li Guangjun also showed signs of fatigue, and the two players battled back and forth. The players were completely drained by the match. At 4-2, then 5-4, Li led twice, but ultimately, due to lack of experience, he lost his temper and made numerous unforced errors. As a result, Qiu added three more games, sealing the victory at 7-5.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng is highly skilled but arrogant, and repeatedly underestimates his opponents. He almost lost to Ma Shaobo of Nanjing yesterday, suffering from the same problem. After the start, Ma fought bravely and successfully, taking a 2-0 lead. Later, he employed several sweeping shots, turning defeat into victory, winning the first set 6-2. Wang found it difficult to change his nature. The old problem resurfaced, and he became arrogant and dismissive, thinking his opponent's skills were average and not worth considering. Unexpectedly, the player from Nanjing was exceptionally strong, winning four consecutive games, threatening to break through completely. The spectators were stunned, and Wenzheng himself was shocked, realizing his opponent was not to be underestimated. He quickly focused and fought carefully. As expected, his skills were superior, and he made several successful plays, quickly gaining momentum, winning six consecutive games and winning the second set 6-4.</p>

<p>Qian Yaobin</p>
<p>Where there are no great generals in Shu, Liao Hua acts as the vanguard. At the previous National Games, Lin Baohua took the stage as a general, with Qian Yaobin as his vanguard. This time, Wang Wenzheng is filling in, while the vanguard position remains with Qian. After a two-year absence, Qian's skills remain the same, without any improvement. Li Buzu of Nanjing, a renowned player from the capital, possesses considerable strength. Comparing the two, they are evenly matched. The ultimate victory yesterday went to Qian, due to his superior stamina. In the first set, Li attacked aggressively, winning 6-4. Qian was unwilling to give in, and in the second set, he fought back bravely, hitting shots to the left and right, returning the favor, winning with the same score of 6-4. The third set was a battle for survival, and the competition was even fiercer. However, Li had expended too much energy in the first two sets, and his stamina gradually declined. Qian maintained his strength, attacking relentlessly. Li only managed to win one game and was eliminated with a score of 6-1.</p>

<h3>Women's Doubles Reach Quarterfinals: Shanghai's Ma Hua Secures Quarterfinal Spot</h3>
<p>Two semi-quarterfinal matches in women's tennis doubles were held yesterday. The Shanghai vs. Guangdong match began at 9 a.m., and the Ma Hua vs. Nanjing match took place at 3 p.m. As a result, Shanghai and Ma emerged victorious, securing quarterfinal qualifications. They will compete tomorrow with Shanxi and Sichuan respectively for a spot in the finals. The Wei sisters of Shanghai are experienced and well-coordinated. The Guangdong girls are far from their opponents. Ma Hua's expatriate, Miss Lu, is short and stout and moves slowly. Miss Xie is petite, lively, and graceful. Both of their skills are based on stability. Huang and Shan, the farmers from Nanjing, have short haircuts and dress like men, with a masculine demeanor. Miss Jin Lin is beautiful and fashionably dressed. Their skills are also quite impressive, comparable to Lu and Xie. Yesterday's elimination was not due to a lack of ability. The results are listed below:</p>
<p>Shanghai vs. Guangdong</p>
<p>The match began at 9 a.m. The Wei sisters of Shanghai took an early lead, winning two games. Yang and Ruan of Guangdong returned the favor, creating a 2-2 tie. Then, the Wei sisters revealed their full force, adding four consecutive games, winning the first set 6-4. In the second set, the Wei sisters maintained their strength, winning two consecutive games. Yang and Ruan tried their best to fight back, winning a game, tying the score at 3-3. The Wei sisters persisted, going up three levels, and triumphantly ended the match at 6-3.</p>
<p>Nanjing vs. Ma</p>
<p>The match began at 3 p.m. The strength of the two sides was equal, and the competition was fierce. The Ma Hua players, mindful of their elimination in the singles, were determined to take revenge. The girls from Nanjing were also not to be taken lightly, defending with all their might and attacking at every opportunity. The Ma Hua team responded calmly, and their determination paid off, winning the first set 6-4. In the second set, the Nanjing team played effectively on both offense and defense, taking an absolute lead of 5-3, on the verge of victory. Unfortunately, time did not wait. The Lu-Xie combination often scored points in the dying moments, winning the second set 7-5.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Girls' Basketball Skills Immature; Unable to Withstand Beijing's Strong Team; Only Score Three Points to Avoid Shutout; Sichuan Loses, Jiangsu Advances</h3>
<p>Yesterday's first round of women's basketball saw two matches. The Beijing vs. Jiangxi match was rescheduled for 11 a.m. The Jiangxi girls' basketball skills were extremely immature, unable to withstand Beijing's strong team. The Jiangsu vs. Sichuan match was fiercely competitive in the first half, but Sichuan faltered in the second half, resulting in Jiangsu's elimination of Sichuan. Today marks the beginning of the second week, with four matches scheduled. The situation is becoming somewhat tense. It is predicted that Fujian, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Beijing will secure a spot in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Beijing Girls Displaying Power</p>
<p>The Beijing vs. Jiangxi match was held yesterday at 11 a.m. The referee was Zhang Zhongfan. The Beijing team's techniques were superb. Ding Zhengzheng was outstanding. In an instant, she scored three consecutive goals. Du Yifang provided support from the left and right, creating a synergistic effect. Jiangxi's techniques were extremely weak, and their understanding of the rules was not thorough. Facing the strong Beijing team, they were easily defeated. Jiangxi only scored three points in the first half, while the rest of the game belonged to Beijing. In the second half, Jiangxi was unable to score at all, resulting in a 46-3 defeat.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Defeats Sichuan</p>
<p>The Jiangsu vs. Sichuan match was the final match of yesterday. Jiangsu's team was composed of top players from Suzhou, Wuxi, and Songjiang, and their strength was considerable. The three forwards were exceptionally lively, and the defender, Shao Weirong, was physically strong, intimidating the Sichuan forwards. However, their cooperation was not yet fully developed. Facing Beijing today, they may not be so successful. Only Pang Lu of the Sichuan team showed promise, and the defender, Chen Dejian, was good. The rest of the team's skills were average. After Sichuan scored the first two points, Jiangsu followed suit. The competition in the first set was intense, and Jiangsu narrowly lost. In the first set, Jiangsu substituted Chen Zhaozhen into the game, strengthening their line. Huang and Zhao, the female players, scored several consecutive goals. Jiangsu took a three-point lead in the first half. In the second half, Sichuan's Chen Dejian was penalized off the court. Jiangsu's forwards became very active. The "girls from the foot of Mount Emei" were at a loss. Although they tried to salvage the situation in the final quarter, the overall trend was set.</p>

<h3>Beijing Easily Defeats Henan; Qingdao Struggles to Eliminate Malayan Chinese; Philippine Islands Win Big Over Sichuan; Nanjing Ousts Shandong; No Matches on the Men's Basketball Western Front Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday's basketball games at the gymnasium were delayed until after 9 a.m. due to a memorial week event held in the gymnasium at 8 a.m. The first match was between Beijing and Henan. Beijing's strength was far superior, and Henan was no match for them. The Qingdao vs. Malayan Chinese game was fiercely contested. In the end, Malayan Chinese lost by a narrow margin of eight points. Philippine Islands won big over Sichuan with a score of 100 to 22. Nanjing vs. Shandong saw Nanjing field a non-standard lineup in the first half, allowing Shandong to hold their own. In the second half, Nanjing's best five players took to the court, and Shandong faltered, ultimately losing by 68 to 36 and being eliminated. Today will be entirely dedicated to the second round of women's basketball. On the men's side, the western front is quiet, with no matches scheduled. Yesterday's competition results:</p>
<p>(1) Beijing defeats Henan: 74 to 30</p>
<p>(2) Qingdao defeats Malayan: 52 to 44</p>
<p>(3) Philippine Overseas Chinese defeats Sichuan: 100 to 22</p>
<p>(4) Nanjing defeats Shandong: 68 to 36</p>
<p>Beijing Easily Defeats Henan</p>
<p>The first-round match between Beijing and Henan was held yesterday at 9:30 a.m. Beijing has many veteran players with a wealth of experience. Initially, they did not play at full strength, so the situation did not become tense. Later, Mu Zuoyun and Yu Jingxiao showed their skills, and Henan's defense was ravaged. The team's cooperation and techniques were quite good, but their movements seemed slightly slow, likely because they had not met a worthy opponent. At the start of the match, Li Baoshan of Beijing committed a foul during a passing sequence. Li Enlong of Henan scored the first point. Li Guochong of Beijing launched a swift attack, scoring several consecutive points. Yu Jingxiao had been lying in wait, scoring two goals. Although the Henan army tried to fight back, Beijing's defense was impregnable. They only managed to score a few points with long shots. In the second half, the Beijing team became increasingly dominant, and Henan was unable to keep up. Yao Yelian and Li Enlong were also subsequently penalized and left the court, leading to an irreversible situation. As a result, they were soundly defeated by 74 to 30.</p>

<p>Philippine Islands Wins Big Over Sichuan</p>
<p>Although Sichuan defeated Mongolia the other day, we knew their average skills could not match the strong Philippine Islands. However, we did not expect them to lose by such a large margin. Yesterday, the Philippine Islands had yet to field their full strength. Otherwise, they could have broken the basketball score record. The Yang brothers had yet to take the field, but Yang Shuhui appeared in the last five minutes. Forward Ma Wenjiu charged into the enemy ranks as if there was no one there, scoring 51 points. The defender, Shi Jiaqi, was unsurpassed in stealing the ball. The basketball championship seemed well within reach. The Sichuan team's skills were immature and easily defeated. They struggled in the first half and became even worse in the second half, watching the Philippine Islands team driving into their territory, unimpeded, reaching 100 points. The fans cheered.</p>

<p>Nanjing Eliminates Shandong</p>
<p>At around 3 p.m., the match between Nanjing and Shandong began. Nanjing is one of the strongest contenders for the basketball championship this year, and their skills are beyond question. Shandong had defeated Jiangsu and their strength was not to be underestimated. During the first half, Nanjing did not field their full lineup, and Shandong put up a strong fight, keeping the score close. In the second half, Nanjing's top five players took to the court, and the Shandong army lost all hope. Little Tang was cunning, turning the heads of his hometown teammates and running them ragged. Li Zhenzhong was tall and had long arms, and he was certain to make the foul shots. Gao Changming was a force to be reckoned with, handling the defense and providing assistance. At the start of the match, Dong Jin used his habitual five-player defense, making it impossible for the Nanjing team to attack. Later, a Shandong defender committed a foul, and Li Zhenzhong made the shot. Once the door was open for the Shandong team, the points flowed in continuously. Little Li scored three consecutive goals, and the scoreboard showed 9-0. Shandong fought bravely, and Tian Zhaoxian contributed, bringing the score closer again. At this time, Little Tang took to the court, and Li substituted for Tao, but the team's lineup lacked cooperation. The first half ended with Nanjing narrowly leading by 23 to 15. In the second half, Nanjing's top five generals took to the court, and the whole team became active. Tang and Li, the two youngsters, passed the ball back and forth, and the score increased rapidly. The Shandong team knew they were defeated and lost by 36 to 18.</p>

<p>Qingdao's Excellent Long-Range Shooting</p>
<p>The match between Qingdao and Malayan Chinese followed the match between Pingjin and Hebei. Both teams were top-tier, so the match was very intense. Every action of the players resonated with the audience. In terms of tactics, both sides excelled in speed. Qingdao's long-range shooting skills were unparalleled. Yesterday's defeat of Malayan Chinese was entirely due to this. Kong Guangyi's prowess was still evident, stealing and passing with the agility of an ape. Ding Shouyu was as steady as a virgin in defense and as fast as a rabbit in attack. He was truly a promising talent. The Malayan Chinese team lacked cooperation, but their individual skills were excellent. Unfortunately, they lost too many points in the first half. Otherwise, the outcome would have been unpredictable. Five minutes into the game, Xu He of Malayan Chinese broke the silence. Qingdao immediately retaliated, and took the lead with 15-10. Malayan Chinese's defense was slightly lacking, and Kong and Zhang stole the ball and scored. Ding Shouyu was like a wild horse, scoring two consecutive long-range shots. Qingdao won the first half with a score of 18-3. When the second half began, the Qingdao army continued their efforts, and their long-range and close-range shots were unstoppable, taking a commanding lead of 40-22. After this setback, the Malayan team rallied, and Ye and Xu, the two forwards, charged into the enemy's ranks, capturing the flag and chasing the score to 4-4. The atmosphere was extremely tense. Qingdao avoided direct confrontation, to avoid their attack. After deliberation, they continued to use long-range shooting tactics, and Malayan Chinese were defeated. Qingdao advanced with a score of 52-44.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Eliminates Hebei; To Compete with Guangdong for Championship on the 18th; Yesterday's Score: 9 to 2 Against Hebei</h3>
<p>The Shanghai baseball team defeated Hebei yesterday in the semi-final (Group B) with a score of 9 to 2, securing the right to compete in the final. They are scheduled to vie for the championship against Guangdong, the defending champions, on the 18th. The upcoming duel between these two powerhouses is highly anticipated. Yesterday, Shanghai's pitcher, Gan Zhen, demonstrated remarkable skill, allowing only two hits in nine innings, which was no easy feat. Reliever He Xiancheng, with his seasoned experience and thoughtful approach, collaborated with the entire team to achieve victory. Hebei's pitchers, Zhang Minhui and reliever Gong Qingzong, were far less skilled than their Shanghai counterparts, displaying weaknesses. However, the infield and outfield coordination was adequate, preventing major errors despite the adverse circumstances. The ball umpire was Zhang Guodong, the base umpire was Chen Futian, and the recorder was Li Baojun.</p>
<p>Battle Lines Drawn, Shanghai Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Hebei took the field to attack first, while Shanghai waited in readiness. Bao Nvpei was first up but was caught out in center field. Chen Bingchou followed, safely reaching first base. He attempted to steal second but was injured and replaced by Bao Wenpei. Then Zhang Minhui hit a double, and Bao, amidst applause, ran back to the base, fulfilling his important mission. However, Zhang's ambitions were thwarted by the subsequent batters' lack of success. When Shanghai switched to offense, Zhou Jun hit and reached first base. The Guangdong pitcher threw a wild pitch, allowing Zhou to advance to second. Liang Chengson then hit, and Zhou returned home victorious. When Zeng Ruiqi hit, Hebei's defense was thrown into disarray, allowing Liang Chengson to score easily. In the first inning, Shanghai took the lead with a score of 2 to 1. In the second inning, none of Hebei's three batters survived. Shanghai engaged in aggressive play, with An Lesheng starting with a double. Fang Guanshao followed and advanced. He Xiancheng lightly tapped, and An Lesheng scored. Zhou Jun and Liang Chengson joined the fray, and second base was full of Shanghai players. Zeng Ruiqi made a hit, and Zhou returned. In the second inning, Shanghai scored two points, while Hebei scored zero.</p>
<p>Soldiers Fighting, Heaven and Earth Change Color</p>
<p>The third inning passed uneventfully. The fourth inning saw a fierce battle. After Hebei lost momentum, Shanghai seized the opportunity and advanced. He Xiancheng scored the first point. Within five minutes, Shanghai's players filled all three bases. Zeng Ruiqi hit a double, and Zhou Jun and Liang Chengson returned home in succession. Liang Fuchu, known as a lucky general, hit a ball that sent Zeng back to base. In this inning, Shanghai scored four points, securing the victory. In the fifth inning, Fang Guanshao performed another miracle, his return to base due to a wild pitch by Hebei's pitcher. The sixth inning saw only minor contact between the two sides, with no gains or losses. In the seventh inning, the entire Hebei team made a concerted effort to attack, and Gong Qingzong, through repeated efforts, finally scored a point. The subsequent players were also strong and capable. All three bases saw Hebei players. Unfortunately, they were repeatedly caught out, wasting all their efforts. In this inning, Hebei scored one point, while Shanghai scored zero. The eighth and ninth innings returned to a quiet state. Hebei gained nothing, and Shanghai abandoned the ninth inning. The final score was Shanghai 9, Hebei 2.</p>

<h3>Previous Women's Softball Champion Guangdong Loses to Shandong; Seven Innings Result in 7 to 2; Shanghai vs. Hebei Today</h3>
<p>The women's softball semi-final (Group A) between Shandong and Guangdong took place yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. Shandong excelled on average and defeated Guangdong with a score of 7 to 2, securing the right to compete in the final. The ball umpire was Shen Guoquan, the base umpire was Gao Zi, and the recorder was Xia Kaiming. Today at 2:00 PM, Shanghai will face Hebei, who lost to Jiangsu, in the semi-final (Group B). The winning team will compete against Shandong for the championship on the afternoon of the 17th at 2:00 PM. The future battle is imminent.</p>
<p>Zhang Muxia Establishes Immortal Merit</p>
<p>Shandong's victory was largely due to pitcher Zhang Muxia. Apart from allowing four hits to the opponent in the second and third innings, she and the infield and outfield adopted a containment strategy in the remaining five innings, leaving the enemy astonished and unable to advance. On the attacking side, she hit a home run in both the first and fifth innings, establishing immortal merit and securing victory. Others, such as Wang Fengjie, Jin Zhiban, and Xu Jun, were skilled at hitting. The team's collaboration was quite polished, showing great promise for the championship.</p>
<p>Zhuo Jin-yi, First on Base</p>
<p>Guangdong's performance was still respectable, and their inner and outer lines responded well. Unfortunately, the pitcher's skills were mediocre, sowing the seeds of much trouble. Even more unfortunate was that the team made many mistakes in the first inning, resulting in great losses. In the fifth inning, when the opponent had already taken two outs, the pitcher became careless and suffered another major blow. Not many were skilled at hitting. Zhuo Jin-yi was considered a master in this regard, first hitting a double, becoming the first Guangdong player to return to base. Liang Shiyi also had a hit in the third inning, scoring a point. All others returned empty-handed.</p>
<p>Tense Seven-Inning Battle</p>
<p>Shandong took the field to challenge, with Wang Fengjie first hitting a high ball. Guangdong's shortstop missed the catch, allowing her to advance to first base, then steal second. Jin Zhiban hit a triple, and Wang returned home. Due to Guangdong's mistakes, Jin also took advantage and returned. Xu Jun hit a high ball, which was caught out. Zhang Muxia then hit a home run, greatly boosting the entire team. Subsequently, both players failed to score. In the first inning, Shandong scored three points, while Guangdong failed to counter. At that time, a minor issue arose, causing a dispute, but it was soon resolved, and the match continued as normal. In the second inning, Guangdong's Zhuo Jin-yi hit a double, boosting morale. Lun Gong then hit a triple and later returned to base on a wild pitch. In this inning, Shandong scored zero, while Guangdong scored one. In the third inning, Guangdong scored another point, while Shandong still scored nothing. The score was two to three, with Guangdong showing signs of making a comeback. In the fourth inning, neither side made progress. In the fifth inning, Shandong's Zhang Muxia hit a home run, with four players returning at once, securing the victory. In the following two innings, both sides remained defensive, with no further developments. The result was 7 to 2, with Shandong winning. Shandong's pitcher was Zhang Muxia, with Jin Zhiban as catcher, while Guangdong's pitcher was Liang Shiyi, with Liang Zhuangjian as catcher.</p>

<h3>Malayan Wins Against Nanjing Yesterday; Tibet Forfeits, Guangdong Wins Without Effort</h3>
<p>The men's volleyball competition concluded yesterday with two matches: Malaya versus Nanjing, and Guangdong versus Tibet. Malaya narrowly defeated Nanjing in a hard-fought battle, while Tibet forfeited the second match, allowing Guangdong to win without effort. The score between Malaya and Nanjing is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Malaya Wins Against Nanjing</p>
<p>Fengshui Surveyed, Malaya Wins First</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, Chen Dedao took his place on the platform and surveyed the fengshui. Nanjing launched the first attack, making good progress. However, out of nowhere, Malaya, despite being on the defensive, redoubled its efforts. Liang Juhe served well, with the ball landing on the edge of the opponent's court. Nanjing attempted a save, but the Malayan front-row blockade was impenetrable. Continuous serves caused Nanjing to not only lose ground but also shake its stronghold. In a state of panic, Nanjing fell behind with a score of 6 to 11. Changing formations, they launched an aggressive counterattack, but due to unrealistic expectations, they were unable to salvage the situation, ending the match at 21 to 12.</p>
<p>Back Route Severed, Nanjing Loses Again</p>
<p>At the start of the second game, Malaya, riding the momentum of their initial victory, went on the offensive, scoring three consecutive points. Nanjing returned the favor, adopting the same tactic and scoring three points. This provided a slight turning point for Nanjing. At 8 to 9, Nanjing scored another point, making the score 8 to 10. However, the recorder, in a muddled state, announced Malaya 11, and the referee ordered a change of sides. The Nanjing team and some spectators were confused. After a correction and resumption of the game, Nanjing changed sides with a score of 11 to 10. Subsequently, the Nanjing third-row military was shaken. Despite the will to advance, the back route was severed, and they ultimately lost the second game with a score of 21 to 17.</p>
<p>Occasional Mistakes Lead to Great Errors</p>
<p>Both sides added new forces to the battle in the third game, advancing and retreating, with no significant achievements. The first half of the game passed uneventfully. In the second half, Malaya became more aggressive, with each player showing brilliant performance. However, good times don't last. At a significant difference of 17 to 10, an occasional mistake became a great error. Nanjing advanced step by step, while Malaya retreated steadily. Team captain Zheng Jimin repeatedly issued warnings and instructions, but in the end, Nanjing turned the game around with a difference of two points, 19 to 21.</p>
<p>Wonderful Performance Buries Nanjing</p>
<p>At the start of the fourth game, Nanjing was even more arrogant. Their morale was high, aiming to turn the tide. In the first half, Malaya was lifeless. At the change of sides, the difference was still 11 to 3. It is regrettable that Nanjing, at this crucial juncture, gave up on themselves and easily relaxed, allowing Malaya to level the score in an instant. Seeing their great position threatened, Nanjing rallied their spirits and fought to the death, with mutual concessions and advances. Each side made achievements. Thus, the scores were close, and the competition became fiercer. For a time, the gunfire was deafening, and the bullets rained down, becoming the most exciting scene of the entire game. In the last five minutes, Malaya's Situ obtained the pass from the second-row setter and jumped high to kill the Nanjing life with an absolute technique. The comparison was 25 to 13, and Malaya eliminated Nanjing with a score of three to one.</p>
<p>(2) Guangdong Wins Against Tibet</p>
<p>Tibet Forfeits, Wins Without Effort</p>
<p>The Guangdong-Tibet match was scheduled to start at 3:00 PM. The Guangdong team arrived at the venue at 1:30 PM to practice. By 3:10 PM, the scheduled time had passed, but the Tibet team had not yet arrived. The referee declared the team to have forfeited, and the victory belonged to Guangdong. Here is the Guangdong team lineup:</p>
<p>(3) Yu Declares Forfeiture</p>
<p>The men's and women's volleyball competitions concluded yesterday. All from Guangdong have now entered the next stage of the competition. Today, the men's volleyball second matches are Shanghai versus Hebei and Zhejiang versus Hong Kong. The women's volleyball second matches are Guangdong versus Hong Kong and Henan versus Shanghai. Yesterday, Henan declared forfeiture, and Shanghai entered the semi-final stage unconditionally.</p>

<h3>Yu Wins Archery Championship; Men's Champion and Runner-Up Swept; Bullet Finals Held Today</h3>
<p>The National Arts competition yesterday morning featured the men's and women's archery (long-range) finals, and the afternoon featured the men's and women's singles weapons preliminaries. The Mongolian wrestling team still came to the venue to observe and participate in friendly matches with wrestlers from Ping, Lu, and Hu. Chu Minyi performed the Tai Chi ball and stick, and all the programs were quite spectacular. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the National Arts venue was particularly crowded. When the Mongolians wrestled with the Han people, there was a veritable crush of people. The results of each group competition and other details are described below:</p>
<p>Archery Competition Swept by Northerners</p>
<p>In the archery (long-range) competition held in the morning, the athletes from Yu Province showed their skills, sweeping the champion and runner-up in both the men's and women's groups. The champion in the women's group, Kou Fenglan, still wore her hair in a bun and dressed very simply. The Ma sisters, when drawing their bows and shooting arrows, glared fiercely with their eyes, truly embodying the spirit of female heroes. It is reported that their usual scores can reach over one hundred meters. Yesterday, they encountered headwinds, and because the wind was strong, their scores were reduced. The sound of sighs was quite audible. Wrestling female athlete Meng Jianli also participated in the archery competition yesterday, but she ranked fifth because she had exerted too much effort during the wrestling competition the day before, and her strength had not yet recovered. In the men's group, Jin Deshun, a Beiping athlete, had completely white hair, but his spirit was strong, truly proving that old age is full of vigor. One arrow was shot far, reaching over one hundred meters, winning third place. Overall, the archery competition was completely swept by northern athletes, with southerners having almost no chance to participate, which also shows the great difference between martial arts in southern and northern China.</p>
<p>Final Results of Women's Long-Range Archery</p>
<p>In the women's long-range archery final held in the morning, only representatives from Henan and Shanghai participated, totaling seven people. However, Chen Jinchai, No. 1979 from Shanghai, forfeited the competition, so only six people competed. Henan sent three female athletes: Ma Ruilian, Ma Ruilan, and Kou Fenglan. Shanghai sent three women: Meng Jianli, Zhao Jingfang, and Wang Jinxia. Ma Ruilan was first, shooting three consecutive arrows, all of which were far beyond the venue, exceeding the original distance, creating a new record for the competition, and causing all the spectators to be astonished. The four-time recorder and referee had to lengthen the distance standard line for calculation. After a busy time, Wang Jinxia and others continued the competition. Each person participated twice, with three arrows each time. The top two names were all won by the three female players from Henan. The results of the six people are listed below:</p>
<p>Rank  Name  Unit  Score</p>
<p>1st Place  Kou Fenglan  Henan  95.89 (meters)</p>
<p>2nd Place  Ma Ruilian  Henan  93.80</p>
<p>3rd Place  Ma Ruilan  Henan  92.30</p>
<p>4th Place  Zhao Jingfang  Shanghai  87.30</p>
<p>5th Place  Meng Jianli  Shanghai  76.55</p>
<p>6th Place  Wang Jinxia  Shanghai  67.25</p>
<p>Results of Men's Long-Range Archery Final</p>
<p>There were twenty-seven participants from seven units: Beiping, Henan, Shandong, Qingdao, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Sichuan. Beiping sent Rao Yulin, Ning Haiting, Jin Deshun, and Ge Xianglin; Henan sent Hai Lanfen, Guan Yunxing, Li Chunying, and Hai Guorong; Shandong sent Wei Wenhai; Qingdao sent Li Zhenbang, Gao Fangxian, Zhou Zuozhen, and Gan Chuanen; Anhui sent Fang Keming and Wu Bohang; Zhejiang sent Li Yuanxiu, Wang Kehua, He Changhai, Chen Zhiqing, Weng Kangting, Jia Zhishan, Zhou Huanlun, and Zheng Lirenn; Sichuan sent He Jianxue, Yang Weiru, Liu Yongxi, and Chen Antai. The men's group started at 3:15 pm and ended at 12:00 pm. The result was the selection of six names. The champion was won by Hai Lanfen from Henan. Lu, Qing, Wan, Zhe, Chuan and other places were defeated. Here are the selected six winners:</p>
<p>Rank  Name  Unit  Score</p>
<p>1st Place  Hai Lanfen  Henan  126.75 meters</p>

<p>Men's and Women's Singles Weapons Preliminaries</p>
<p>The men's and women's singles weapons preliminaries were still held at the National Arts venue from 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Most of the participants in the preliminaries were from Ping, Jin, Yu, Lu, and Xiang. The weapons used were mostly swords, sticks, and other weapons. The competition order was first women and then men. There were sixty-five participants in the men's group and twenty participants in the women's group. As a result of the preliminaries, twelve people were selected from each group, and the finals will be held again on the afternoon of the 16th. Among yesterday's performances, the players from Beiping Province were the most spectacular. The competition ended at 5:00 PM. The list of names recorded in the two groups' preliminaries is listed below:</p>

<p>Chu Minyi Performs Tai Chi Ball</p>
<p>Chu Minyi performed Tai Chi Ball and Tai Chi Stick at the National Arts Venue at 4:00 PM yesterday. Wu Shanchang also came to visit and applauded non-stop. Chu wore beige clothes and pants and long black leather boots, looking energetic with developed muscles. The Tai Chi Ball was made of copper-plated nickel, about one foot in diameter, weighing thirty kilograms, and as bright as a mirror, suspended on a wooden frame. The Tai Chi Stick was a foot long and as thick as a small arm, attached to the frame by a rubber band. Chu first performed the Tai Chi Ball, frequently rubbing the ball with his back, chest, abdomen, and arms, and Chu's muscles also bulged one by one. The performance was quite spectacular. He then performed the Tai Chi Stick, with movements similar to the Tai Chi Ball, lasting about ten minutes.</p>
<p>Mongolian Wrestling Team Is Truly Powerful</p>
<p>After the Mongolian wrestling team arrived, they immediately conducted friendly matches with wrestling athletes from North China. The first pair was Aornasutu (Mongolian) against Wei Dehai (Ping). Wei was also tall and mighty. Once they began, Wei was immediately thrown to the ground by Aornasutu. The second pair was Batur (Mongolian) against Shan Shijun (Ping). Shan entering the venue seemed to have a special interest in this sport, so he danced and swayed when facing the Mongolian, expressing his joy. But once the two men met, Shan tried to grab Batur's collar, but the Mongolian wrestling clothes were made of leather with copper nails, so there was no way to grab them. Instead, Batur grabbed Shan's back and pushed him back, and Shan could not support himself and fell to the ground. The third pair was Badama (Mongolian) against Li Zhenqing (Hu), who also fell to the ground after a single attempt. At this time, veteran Bi Fengting could not stand the arrogance of the Mongolians, so he volunteered to step forward and fight the Mongolians to avenge the shame of the three previous defeats. The opponent was Buhe (Mongolian). With the sound of a whistle, Bi rushed forward to fight. They held each other for a long time, and Bi could still support himself, so the general audience applauded greatly. Unfortunately, the veteran was careless and was thrown to the ground by Buhe using brute force, and Bi retired in anger. The fourth pair was Samadaenzhamu (Mongolian) against Bu Enfu (Ji). Bu had a relatively slender lower body and knew that he could not win by strength, so he sought a different way to win. When the two men began, Bu took a defensive posture. But the Mongolian was as strong as an ox and grabbed Bu's sleeves, dragging Bu, who was almost in a dangerous situation. Fortunately, Bu was skilled in application and did not fall. Bu then waited for an opportunity to attack. At one point, Bu took advantage of the situation and grabbed Sama's sleeve, dragging him forward and butting Sama's chest with his head, while raising his right foot to hook Sama's left foot. Sama could not support himself and fell to the left, but Sama's strength was great, and he used this opportunity to press his entire body towards Bu. The two fell to the ground at the same time, and Bu, falling below, lost the battle. Afterwards, the players from various places stopped advancing. Although there were still two wrestling matches, they ultimately failed. The reason for the failure was not just lack of effort. The wrestling clothes worn by the Mongolians were specially made and difficult to grab, so it was difficult to use strength and difficult to apply techniques, which was the biggest reason for the failure.</p>
<p>Award Ceremony Rescheduled to the 19th</p>
<p>The athletes who had already completed the finals yesterday and were listed in the top six should have been led by the National Arts Stock to the stage to receive awards and take photos. However, due to the fact that not all the people were present, the ceremony was rescheduled to the afternoon of the 19th after all the National Arts competition programs were completed. The National Arts Stock will lead all the winning athletes to receive awards and take photos. As for the men's (wrestling finals, they were not held yesterday either. It has been decided by the referees to hold them after the equipment (opponents) competition today. If there is still not enough time, it will be rescheduled to 9:00 AM on the 16th. The National Stock has notified each unit separately.</p>
<p>Mongolian Song and Dance Performance</p>
<p>After the Mongolian wrestling performance, the team leader Enjun ordered them to line up and bow to the audience to express their gratitude. Referee Chu Minyi, together with the team leader, led the entire team out of the National Arts venue and walked along the track to the podium, where they took off their hats and bowed to the audience with great respect. The entire team performed Mongolian dances and sang Mongolian songs. While the sound film company was releasing sound films for about three hours, the team leader led the team out of the venue and returned.</p>
<p>Today's Program Is Even More Exciting</p>
<p>Bullet (Finals for Men and Women)  9:00 AM</p>
<p>Weapons (Opponents)  Men's Preliminary  1:00 PM</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Swimming Athletes Continued to Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday; Liu Baoxi Could Not Come Along</h3>
<p>The deputy leader of the Hong Kong delegation, Huang Jiajun, and swimming athletes Chen Fuxing (male) and Chen Yuhui (female) arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the President Wilson. According to reports, backstroke athlete Liu Baoxi could not come along due to academic reasons. Although the strength of the Hong Kong team is strong, Liu Baoxi is an important pillar. If he cannot arrive in time, the Hong Kong region will be greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Chen Jianru of Beijing Praises Shanghai's Achievements; Abundant Spirit of the Games</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th) Chen Jianru, director of the Beijing Social Affairs Bureau, returned to Beijing on the morning of the 14th and will go to Shanghai again on the 16th. Chen said that the spirit of the National Games is abundant, giving a very good impression to all parties. Although the Beijing delegation has not achieved outstanding results in the competitions, they have gained many opportunities to observe and hone their skills, and they can also make progress technically. In all the competitions, Shanghai has created new records. This kind of harvest is commendable. Shanghai's completeness and high scores are the result of years of promoting sports, with a solid and long-lasting history. Beijing has a shorter history and it is difficult to produce anything comparable.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Memorial Week Ceremony Led by Mayor Wu and Director Pan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Monday, the National Games Memorial Week was held at the gymnasium at 8:30 AM. Mayor Wu and Director Pan led the ceremony. Security team members, police officers, Boy Scouts, and athletes all participated. After the ceremony, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating that it was not by chance that everyone was able to hold the Memorial Week here today but was a result of the well-planned and united Sixth National Games. The holding of this National Games allowed Shanghai's 3.5 million residents to witness dozens of physically and mentally vigorous athletes from various provinces, proving to the young people present that China's desire for a healthy population and a strong nation is not impossible. We must know that the current national difficulties and dangers were not created overnight but are the result of over a hundred years of weakness, leading to today's severe national crisis. Therefore, to ensure the nation's survival, we must continue to strive with a spirit of perseverance for a long-term revival. At this point, Mayor Wu cited the German nation before and after the European War and its current revival as evidence, encouraging the people to endure hardship and strive for national strength. However, the physical and mental strength of the nation depends on the people's training and promotion of sports. I sincerely hope that the athletes representing various provinces and cities in the National Games can become practitioners who spread the seeds of strong national work. The future strength of China and the foundation for national revival lie entirely in the actions of today's youth. I hereby offer this chapter as encouragement to all staff and athletes.</p>
<h3>Last Night, President Wang Hosted a Banquet for Athletes; Mr. Wang Zhengting Delivered a Thank-You Speech – Followed by a General Assembly Song and Entertainment</h3>
<p>The honorary vice president of the General Assembly, Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, hosted a banquet at the gymnasium last night at 6:30 PM for all athletes, team leaders, representatives, General Assembly staff, referees, etc., from various provinces, cities, districts, and overseas Chinese, with over three thousand people in attendance. Mayor Wu first gave a report, followed by President Wang's speech, and then Wang Zhengting gave a thank-you speech on behalf of the athletes, first thanking Wang for the invitation and the preparations for the General Assembly, and then saying that all athletes should strive for physical health, mental progress, and unified efforts to save the nation. Finally, he shouted "Long live the Republic of China" three times. At the end of the event, each person was given a large box of dry food, exquisitely made by Guanshengyuan, containing chicken, meat, eggs, bread, cake, oranges, butter, sugar, salt, etc., everything was complete, and the guests were very satisfied.</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM, the General Assembly entertainment began, with female stars from the Star Film Company performing songs. Hu Die gave a speech, which was quite appropriate, followed by solos by Hu Die, Xu Lai, and over ten other people, accompanied by beautiful music.</p>
<h3>The 32nd Army Polo Team Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Performance at the General Assembly on the 17th</h3>
<p>The eleven members of the 32nd Army Polo Team, who came from Peiping to Shanghai to participate in the National Games performance, along with seventeen horses, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and immediately lodged at the National Games venue. They are scheduled to perform at the stadium at 3:00 PM on the 17th. According to the team leader, Liu Yunxie, the purpose of the army polo team's trip to the south for the National Games performance is to promote the sport. Furthermore, since Westerners in Shanghai also have such organizations, they can use this as an opportunity for mutual learning. In addition to the performance at the General Assembly on the 17th, they were originally scheduled to have four friendly matches with the Shanghai West Commercial Polo Team on the 21st, 23rd, 26th, and 28th. Around the end of the month, they will go to Peiping for a performance at the Central Cavalry School before returning north to the military headquarters.</p>

<h3>First Preparatory Meeting of the Chinese Physical Education Society</h3>
<p>Continuing to solicit initiators, another meeting on the 17th</p>
<p>The Chinese Physical Education Society held its first preparatory meeting at the Deling Apartment yesterday. Yuan Dunli chaired the meeting and appointed Hao Gengsheng, Wu Yunrui, Cheng Dengke, Yuan Jiaoli, Shen Siliang, Shao Rugan, Wu Cheng, Zhang Dongping, Wu Bangwei, Wang Lianggui, and ten others to be responsible for the preparations and continue to solicit initiators. The solicitation letter has already been sent out and is recorded below: Dear Sir, Physical education in our country has made significant progress in recent years due to the active promotion by the whole country. However, the driving force behind its promotion is mostly focused on administration, teaching, and competition, and there is still a lack of purely academic research institutions for physical education, resulting in little discussion of practical theories in physical education. The Qingdao Physical Education Discussion Group of the Chinese Physical Education Association and colleagues in the education field in Beijing and Shanghai, in view of this, have proposed the organization of the Chinese Physical Education Society to provide opportunities for the dissemination and research of physical education. The first preparatory meeting was held at Deling Apartment at 6:00 PM on the 13th of this month. It was unanimously agreed to take advantage of the Sixth National Games in Shanghai, where leaders and celebrities from the national youth education sector are gathered, to solicit initiators to facilitate the process, and it was decided that the initiators' meeting will be held again at 6:00 PM on the 17th of this month in the dining room on the second floor of Deling Apartment on Sichuan Road. We have always admired your enthusiasm for physical education and your leadership among the masses. We respectfully hope that you will grant us your permission to attend the meeting on time.</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of the General Assembly; Shanghai Delegation Approved for Photography Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The city delegation's photography session the day before yesterday was unsuccessful due to an incomplete number of people. It has now been rescheduled to be held at the swimming pool at 9:00 AM on the 16th. All staff and athletes are urged to gather on time and not to be late.</p>
<p>YMCA Welcomes Athletes and Leaders</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA, the earliest organization in our country to promote physical education, has a deep relationship with the sports world. Tonight at 7:30 PM, a banquet will be held on the ninth floor, East Hall, of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge to welcome the athletes and leaders of the National Games, as well as all the athletes from the border regions and overseas Chinese of our country. The program includes a welcoming speech by Lu Ganchen, the general secretary of the YMCA, and Dr. Wang Rutang, the honorary president of the YMCA, as well as music by the Zhu brothers to add to the fun.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Gymnasium</h3>
<p>New Additions to the Gymnasium:</p>
<p>A new addition to the gymnasium is a large wireless broadcasting machine. There are sub-machines inside and outside the gymnasium. One moment it's Peking opera, the next it's songs, which is quite lively. However, during the competition, it feels a bit obtrusive. Its sound mixes with the referee's whistle, which can cause confusion. Later, it was temporarily stopped and only broadcast during breaks or after each match.</p>
<p>Various Different Roars:</p>
<p>The competition has been tense for days, and each team has organized cheering squads that cheer loudly. The sounds made by the men are sometimes like Tarzan's roar, and sometimes like the roar of King Kong in the King Kong movie. The sounds made by the women are like echoes from warships or factories, and sometimes like the roar of lions. If these various sounds were sometimes recorded, they could become a spectacle of strange sounds.</p>
<p>Beautiful Costumes:</p>
<p>The costumes of the Shanghai and Malayan women's basketball players are extremely beautiful. Shanghai's are yellow silk shirts with red characters and purple pants, with strong colors. The Malayan team has peach-colored shirts and snow-white pants, with jade arms fully exposed, with bright colors. During the competition, it's like colorful butterflies flying, and like heavenly maidens scattering flowers. Several ladies and young ladies said softly, "What beautiful costumes!"</p>
<p>Identification by Hair:</p>
<p>In the women's basketball game between Guangdong and Qingdao the day before yesterday, all the Guangdong girls had permed hair, while the Qingdao girls did not. Therefore, the referee felt it was very convenient. When officiating, there was no need to look at the team names on the teams' uniforms, as they could be identified by their hair.</p>
<p>"Can't Run, Brother!"</p>
<p>The basketball court in the gymnasium is extremely well-constructed, and the ground is exceptionally smooth. Most athletes from the interior have never been to such a venue. In addition, their skills are also poor, so they often somersault and fall with every step, as if they were climbing an oiled mountain, with a sigh of "Can't run, brother!"</p>
<p>Betting Two Chicken Cakes:</p>
<p>In the battle between Qingdao and Malaya, two spectators bet on the winner. One bought a ticket for Qingdao, and the other bought a ticket for Malaya. The item they were betting on was two large chicken cakes. As a result, the one who bet on Qingdao won. The one who bet on Malaya had to rub his belly and go hungry.</p>

<h3>International Education Society Holds School Achievement Exhibition</h3>
<p>This port is an area where Chinese and foreigners live together. People from all countries have established schools separately for the sake of educating their children. Their curriculum, academic system, teaching inspection, management, etc. are different from each other. Leaders in the education field, in view of this, organized the International Education Society in 1931, bringing educators from various countries together to study the improvement of school education. The presidents over the years have been Li Zhaohuan, president of Jiaotong University, Kang Xia, principal of Huatong Public School, and Wei Yusi, principal of the American School. Until 1937, when the election was changed, Dr. Wei Quegong was elected as president. The daily affairs of the society are to visit each other's schools, hold lectures and discuss educational issues on a regular basis. However, this year, in order to arouse the interest of all sectors of society in studying education, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, Hilliard, Director of the Department of Education of the Public Works Department, and Guo Sibo, Principal of the French School, were appointed as instructors, and it was decided to hold a large exhibition of the achievements of Chinese and Western schools at the Chinese Youth Association in Baxianqiao, French Concession from November 8 to 10 this year. In addition to displaying the achievements of Chinese and Western schools and giving speeches and writing competitions, students from each school will also arrange entertainment programs on a daily basis to entertain guests. The society has now appointed a committee to plan in various ways, and the work is very tense. Those who want to know the details of the academic exhibition can directly contact Mr. Baer of Mellon Middle School on Zhaofeng Road.</p>
<h3>Shanghai School for the Blind and School for the Deaf Hold Exhibition and Amusement Fair</h3>
<p>The Shanghai School for the Blind and the School for the Deaf have been established for many years and specialize in accepting deaf children. The school is located at No. 290 Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai. The school buildings are magnificent, the environment is excellent, and the facilities are perfect. The teachers hired have in-depth research on blind and deaf education, so the level of students is quite high. As a result, the children of important figures in the party and state and those who come from afar to study at the two schools are approaching each other. It is heard that the two schools will hold an achievement exhibition and an amusement fair on the 19th and 20th of this month to welcome people from all walks of life to visit.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Study Load and Teaching Time for Middle School Students (II)</h3>
<p>-- Yi Ping</p>
<p>Leaving aside erroneous observations and inferences, let us conduct a vertical and horizontal examination of middle school teaching hours. First, regarding the vertical aspect, ten years before the founding of the Republic of China, that is, in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the Ministry of Education stipulated that the teaching hours for each subject in middle school were 36 hours per week. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education stipulated that the first year of boys' middle school was 33 hours, the second year was 34 hours, and the third and fourth years were each 35 hours. The number of hours for each grade in girls' middle school was reduced by one hour compared to the corresponding grade in boys' middle school, that is, from 32 to 34 hours. In the 18th year, the Ministry of Education of the National Government promulgated the Provisional Curriculum Standards, stipulating that the junior high school should have one hundred and eighty-six credits and the senior high school should have one hundred and fifty-six credits. On average, junior high school has 31 credits per semester and senior high school has 26 credits. At that time, the definition of a credit was: one hour of class per week per semester is one credit. However, drawing, crafts, music, physical education, and natural science experiments, as well as outside-of-class preparation, self-study, or preparation and self-study time that is relatively short, should be discounted. Therefore, in fact, 31 credits are at least 35 or 36 hours per week, and 26 credits are at least 33 or 34 hours per week, because senior high school has more natural science credits. Second, regarding the horizontal aspect, among the major European countries, France and Italy have relatively few teaching hours in middle school. According to the middle school teaching hours table implemented in France in April 1931, the second grade has 20 hours per week, the third to sixth grades have at least 12 hours per week and at most 23.5 hours per week, the seventh grade philosophy class has 24 hours, and the mathematics class has 25 hours. However, physical education and class discussions that occur in the classroom are not included in these hours. In Italy, middle school in the Ginnaio section has 21 hours per week in each grade, 24 hours per week in grades one to five, and 26 hours per week in grades one to three in the Liceo section. The science middle school in the Liceo section has 25 hours per week in the first grade and 26 hours per week in grades two to four. As with France, physical education hours are not included. Germany is a hardworking country. In the old various middle schools, the sixth and fifth grades of the classical middle school and the literary and practical middle school, that is, the first and second grades, each have 24 hours per week, and the fourth grade to the upper grade, that is, the third grade to the ninth grade, each have 26 to 28 hours per week. The sixth to fourth grades of the practical middle school, the new literary and practical middle school, and the German middle school each have 25 hours, and the lower two grades to the upper grade each have 26 to 28 hours. The newly established middle school after the European War is a six-year middle school from the lower three grades to the upper grade, with each grade having at least 28 hours per week and at most 30 hours, averaging 29 hours. None of the middle schools include physical education hours. Russia is a tough country. The first three years of her middle school continue the unified labor school and are called the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades. The fifth grade has 35 hours per week, and the sixth and seventh grades each have 36 hours. The last two years are called the eighth and ninth grades, and are divided into teacher training, cooperation, administration, and other departments. Each department is divided into groups. Except for three or several groups that have 36 or 37 hours per week, the rest each have 38 hours. This number includes physical education hours. The British middle school system is very inconsistent, but the British Ministry of Education has issued an order stating that middle schools that accept students aged 12 to 16 can adopt the teaching subjects and hours proposed by the Ministry. This table stipulates that teaching is 35 to 37 hours per week (to be continued).</p>

<h3>Health and Medical Journal</h3>
<h3>A Few Words on Various Treatments for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>-- Dr. Yuan Yimin</p>
<p>There are so many drugs for treating gonorrhea and electrical machines for treating gonorrhea. Generally speaking, there are only four types of treatment: 1. Electrical therapy. The meaning of electrical therapy is to kill bacteria with heat, the so-called hyperthermia sterilization. Among these electrical therapies, only the short-wave diathermy machine is the most valuable. Those who use the Fulco motor and long-wave diathermy machine are difficult to achieve considerable results, and even extend the healing period. Moreover, they also have the drawbacks of burning the skin. In addition, in the acute urethral gonorrhea, irradiation with cold light from a mercury quartz lamp, the so-called light sterilization, also has considerable effect. 2. Injection therapy. Pigments and mixed gonorrhea vaccines are used alternately, one to kill bacteria with drugs and the other to automatically immunize, which can be said to be appropriate. 3. Internal thigh method. A special preparation with strong penetration, anti-inflammatory, bactericidal, and analgesic effects should be selected. The "Mesalym" of the German Merck Chemical Company can be said to be perfect in these aspects. 4. Local therapy. Usually, silver protein and other substances are used for washing and injecting, which is a direct drug sterilization method. If the time and concentration of the liquid are not appropriate, it will be laborious and ineffective, and it is not as effective as the direct immune method of the vaccine. "Gonorrhoea Relief," produced by the German Manerzda Pharmaceutical Factory, is a preparation of gonorrhea serum and relief, and is a special agent for treating urethral gonorrhea. It is now sold by the Ren Shou Western Drug Company in this port. Those who suffer from Gonorrhoea and are unable to seek medical treatment due to various restrictions can also achieve good results by using "Mesalym" and "Gonorrhoea Relief" for self-treatment. Moreover, it is convenient for both men and women to use, which is especially its advantage. However, if it is not possible to determine whether it is gonorrhea, it is advisable to seek medical examination. The Chunzai Hospital at No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, this port, has all the electrical machines used in medical treatment. It employs male and female doctors who specialize in internal and external departments and all venereal diseases. It has particularly comprehensive equipment for the treatment of gonorrhea, such as vacuum tube short-wave diathermy machines and the latest treatment machines, which are all the best products. It is truly doing everything possible to treat the disease.</p>
<h3>Differences Between Sexual Neurasthenia and Cerebral Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Physician Cui Fuqing</p>
<p>Sexual neurasthenia is a weakening disease of the nerves in the sexual organs. This means the sexual nerves are easily excited and easily fatigued, leading to reproductive organ dysfunction such as impotence or infertility. Prominent symptoms include spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and erectile dysfunction. The root cause is often excessive sexual activity and masturbation.</p>
<p>Cerebral neurasthenia is a symptom of general neurasthenia, most noticeably in the brain. Common symptoms include a feeling of pressure and heaviness in the head, sluggish thinking, poor memory, dizziness, blurred vision, indigestion, palpitations, insomnia, back pain, and weakness in the limbs. These symptoms gradually develop and affect the entire body, representing the most severe stage of neurasthenia. The causes are varied; aggravated sexual neurasthenia or excessive mental work can both lead to cerebral neurasthenia. Having sexual neurasthenia does not necessarily mean also having cerebral neurasthenia, but having cerebral neurasthenia often accompanies sexual neurasthenia. Regardless of whether it is cerebral or sexual neurasthenia, the underlying cause is nerve weakness, a deficiency of phosphorus and endocrine fluids in the body, which prevents proper nourishment of various organs. Therefore, taking reliable phosphorus and endocrine preparations can help. For example, "An Er Shen," sold by "Ren Shou Pharmacy," contains sufficient phosphorus and endocrine substances and is a specialized remedy for neurasthenia. Taking it as directed will yield good results. (Editor's note: Dr. Cui Fuqing is skilled in treating neurasthenia, addressing all nerve-related ailments such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and dizziness with remarkable effectiveness, earning him the reputation of an expert. "An Er Shen," which he frequently prescribes, is available at the Western medicine departments of Wing On and Sincere department stores, as well as Nanyang, Wuzhou, Huacheng and other large pharmacies in this city, priced at $1.50 per box.)</p>
<h3>Stomach Ailments and Stomach Treasure</h3>
<p>— Physician Wei Zunsan</p>
<p>The most common gastric disorders include acute catarrhal gastritis, hyperacidity, and gastric fluid leakage. The prominent symptoms are usually stomach pain, vomiting, belching, and acid regurgitation. In treating these conditions, alkaline agents are typically used. Adding a powerful analgesic can provide quick relief. The various medications sold by Ren Shou Pharmacy at No. 1 Laode Hang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai, are praised by the medical community. Among them, "Stomach Treasure" is a rich alkaline preparation containing potent analgesic ingredients. It is used to treat acute and chronic catarrhal gastritis and hyperacidity. For all types of stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and conditions suitable for alkaline agents, taking it provides immediate relief. Senior physician Gao Fangweng uses this medicine frequently, and it is said to cost $2 per box.</p>
<h3>Record of Curing Scabies</h3>
<p>— Physician He Tianlu</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Buyun suffered from scabies for five or six years and had seen numerous doctors without success. Sometimes treatments seemed to work, but after a period, the condition would relapse. He wasted money and endured much suffering. This May, he sought treatment from me. I found pus and scabs all over his body. He complained of unbearable itching, which worsened at night. During the most severe outbreak, I instructed him to purchase "Miejuejun" (Germ Terminator) from Ren Shou Pharmacy at No. 1 Laode Hang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai. To my surprise, the results were remarkable. After applying it for about two weeks, the persistent ailment of several years was completely eradicated. Several months have passed, and it has not recurred. With this effective medicine, those suffering from skin diseases can rest assured. (Editor's note: Miejuejun is a renowned Chinese and foreign remedy for skin diseases, long recognized by the medical community. It is available at Wing On, Sincere, Nanyang, Wuzhou, Huacheng Pharmacies and other large stores in this city, priced at $1 per box.)</p>
<h3>Remarkable Efficacy of Lin Du Shu Le Er for Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Jiang Guofan</p>
<p>The best treatments for gonorrhea are short-wave diathermy and injections of mixed gonococcal vaccine. However, sometimes limitations of location, time, and money make self-treatment necessary. For self-treatment, the most practical methods are oral medication and topical treatment. For oral medication, "Mieshalin," produced by the German-American Meijian Trading Company, is highly recommended because of its strong ability to penetrate mucous membranes. Since Dr. Zhang Shouming published an article recommending it, it has been praised by the medical community and is widely used by patients. As for external medications, disinfection with medicinal solutions is commonly used. This method can be adjusted for time and concentration by doctors for patients, but self-administration by patients usually does not yield good results. Now, the German Manerzhi Pharmaceutical Factory has developed "Jin Lin Du Shu Le Er," a medicine for local application in the urethra for gonorrhea. It is made from gonorrheal serum and is injected locally into the urethra. Because of its auto-immune properties, it is more effective than injections of mixed gonococcal vaccine and can achieve accurate cures.</p>
<h3>Points to Note When Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Physician Wu Lutang</p>
<p>Addiction to tobacco does not happen overnight, and a safe cessation requires more than just rough, hasty measures to achieve the best result. Although today's methods for quitting smoking are extremely refined, appropriate application ensures successful cessation. However, attention must be paid to preventing common withdrawal symptoms like spermatorrhea, insomnia, diarrhea, and limb soreness; boosting physical strength to combat fatigue and listlessness after quitting; and eliminating cravings. The choice of medication, understanding of one's constitution, and timing are all closely related, and even the slightest error can cause discomfort for the quitter. My old friend Yu Lei, an expert in internal medicine, sees dozens of people seeking to quit smoking every day. His experience and methods are extensive and sophisticated. He practices medicine at the Chunzai Hospital at No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai. His fees for acupuncture and medication are only $2 per day, regardless of the number of years of addiction or the amount of tobacco consumed. He also offers special discounts for house calls to smoking cessation patients.</p>
<h3>Self-Treatment for Gonorrhea in Women</h3>
<p>— Doctor Liu Xuannv</p>
<p>Women with venereal diseases are often ashamed to seek medical attention, especially when infected with gonorrhea. Initially, the symptoms of gonorrhea in women are only mild leukorrhea. However, if left untreated, it will lead to complications and even death from peritonitis. Patients are best off seeking medical treatment, but if that is not possible, they should not let the condition worsen and should seek self-treatment. The only methods for self-treatment are oral medication and external application. The best oral medication is "Mieshalin," and the best external medication is "Lin Du Shu Le Er." Using both methods in combination can cure even stubborn conditions of many years. (Editor's note: Dr. Liu Xuannv is skilled in treating gynecological disorders and currently practices at the Chunzai Hospital at No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession. "Mieshalin" and "Lin Du Shu Le Er," which she recommends, are both sold by Ren Shou Pharmacy at No. 1 Laode Hang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession. They are also available at Wing On, Sincere, Nanyang, Wuzhou, Huacheng pharmacies on Ximen Heping Road, and other large stores.)</p>
<h3>Treatment of Parasitic Skin Diseases</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>The renowned skin disease remedy "Miejuejun" (MISULZIN), praised by patients and doctors alike, is universally recognized as the leading treatment for skin diseases. Its accuracy and efficacy are unmatched, and its pleasant fragrance and non-staining properties are additional advantages. It is especially effective for parasitic skin diseases due to its strong bactericidal power and ability to penetrate deep into the skin layers. Try applying it for scabies, stubborn ringworm, acne, and rosacea, and you will see immediate results. This medication is one of the high-quality medicines sold by Ren Shou Pharmacy and costs only $1 per box. It is available at the Western medicine departments of Wing On and Sincere department stores, as well as Nanyang Pharmacy on Nanjing Road, Wuzhou Pharmacy, and Huacheng Pharmacy on Ximen Heping Road.</p>

<h3>Remarkable Experience of Treating Gonorrhea with a Combination of Mieshalin and Lin Du Shu Le Er</h3>
<p>— Doctor Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Li had acute anterior urethral gonorrhea with symptoms of severe pain during urination and profuse purulent discharge. After three days without medication, I instructed him to purchase "Mieshalin" for oral administration and "Lin Du Shu Le Er" for urethral injection from Ren Shou Pharmacy at No. 1 Laode Hang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession. After about ten days, the pus disappeared completely, and the urine became clear. I then instructed him to have a test at the Xiehe Pathology Laboratory, and the microscopic examination showed no gonococci, only a few pus cells and epithelial cells. Patient Mr. Xu had subacute anterior urethral gonorrhea with symptoms of no acute inflammation or pain, but a large amount of purulent discharge, which had been present for two weeks. He had received several injections of pigment and vaccine and had purchased and taken ordinary gonorrhea medication from the market, but without good results. I instructed him to administer "Lin Du Shu Le Er" for local urethral injection twice a day and to take "Mieshalin" tablets orally. After nearly twenty days, he was completely cured. There was no more discharge, and the microscopic examination showed no gonococci.</p>

<h3>An Appeal to the National Games</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The Sixth National Games opened on National Day at the city's stadium. This year, 38 units from various regions participated, with over 2,000 athletes, a new record for the Games. On that day, there were over 100,000 Chinese and foreign spectators, presenting an unprecedentedly enthusiastic scene. This shows that the Chinese people have a considerable understanding of sports. Our country has long been mocked as the "Sick Man of East Asia." If the Chinese people can uphold the belief of strengthening the country and the race, and everyone dedicates themselves to physical training, then the nation's future may still have hope for revival.</p>
<p>However, we feel that there are still some shortcomings and errors in our country's promotion of sports. Originally, the goal of promoting sports is to guide the people's physical health. To achieve this goal, we must strive to popularize sports so that all citizens, regardless of gender, age, or status, understand the importance of sports and practice beneficial exercises. However, our country's promotion of sports often neglects this. Previously, only schools had sports subjects. Although we have gradually paid attention to mass sports in recent years, it is still limited to a portion of the population and cannot be called popularization. The majority of the people still do not have the opportunity to participate in sports. This must be said to be a major shortcoming.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the purpose of promoting sports is to strengthen the body, we cannot merely use winning medals as an incentive. The purpose of holding sports meets is to give athletes the opportunity to showcase their athletic skills and to arouse people's attention to sports. At a sports meet, we certainly hope to achieve excellent results. However, if we simply encourage athletes to compete for medals, this will only cultivate a few athletes and create a few records, which inevitably loses the true meaning of sports. Chinese athletes often exercise to show off. Furthermore, schools often promote sports to advertise the school. This attitude is very wrong.</p>
<p>We believe that the above two points need to be corrected. Therefore, as this National Games is being held, we are specifically raising these points for discussion. We hope that a group of patriotic people who are enthusiastic about sports will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Grapes</h3>
<p>— Yueshan</p>
<p>A friend from the dormitory gave me a branch of grapes, with two leaves still attached. Although the leaves were half-withered, they made the clusters of round pearls look very lovely. I did not eat them; I hung them by the lampshade on the desk corner, and the room suddenly became more colorful and harmonious. The green lampshade cast a yellowish-green light, which softly shone on the round pearls, making them even more adorable.</p>
<p>The grapes reminded me of a friend who used to steal grapes with me. That friend disappeared with the fall of the Northeast and has been separated from me for three years without any news.</p>
<p>Three years ago, we were studying at a church school on a hillside. Next to the school was a large orchard, planted with grapes all over the hill, which were used for winemaking. I had seen the servants carrying barrels of grapes to the kitchen to make wine. The foreign priest in a black gown, with a flushed face, spoke fluent Chinese and taught the servants what to do; the barrels of grapes smiled at us like pearls, but we students could not eat even one. Because the orchard was the residence of the priests, we could not enter.</p>
<p>But after I had that friend, that companion who stole grapes with me, I often ate grapes. I was afraid that only the two of us in the whole school were breaking the rules: climbing over the short wall, squatting under the grape trellis, tiptoeing to eat our fill, and often carrying out a big bag.</p>
<p>"Let's go," he didn't say much, just one word. The rough red face of that Northeasterner naturally revealed a few smiles, with a knowing look in his eyes. We would silently leave the dormitory, bypass the big pine forest, and walk towards the orchard. He always invited me. He was bold and smiled, and his smile was full of confidence, which made me not forget him. He was tall and had a lot of brute strength. He was not afraid of the servants who were loyal to the foreign masters; he often scolded them, calling them foreign dogs.</p>
<p>In the orchard, we were once caught by a servant. The servant was very kind and did not embarrass us, only gently saying, "Mr. Han, the priest is over there in the pavilion."</p>
<p>Mr. Han ignored him. I watched the servant's back fade away, feeling a little scared. I said, "Let's go, this big bag is enough for them to eat."</p>
<p>"Ignore him, what the x priest!" He was so overbearing, still turning his face away to pick grapes, those lovely round pearls.</p>
<p>After a while, a foreigner in a black robe appeared by the grape trellis. The round pearls turned into the priest's terrifying face. I looked up from below: a pair of long, shiny black leather shoes; above that: a black satin robe swaying in the wind; above that, above the round pearls, was a terrifying face, angry eyes, shooting out the fierce light of a beast. I was dumbfounded, because I remembered we had met him more than once.</p>
<p>Old Han tugged at the hem of my long gown, and I followed him away. The orchard was very quiet, and the green leaves were covered with the light of dusk.</p>
<p>"Hey, you!" the old priest said, chasing after us, calling us to stop. We stopped. Naturally, we received a lecture. The old priest also said some deceptive things about how everyone could eat when they were all ripe, saying that it was a private residence and we should not enter casually, and that entering and picking grapes was stealing.</p>
<p>"Let's go, ignore him," Old Han said; I also timidly followed him away. This was naturally disrespectful to the old priest, but the word "stealing" entered Old Han's ears, and he was not convinced; he had that kind of brute strength.</p>
<p>The strange thing was that the school authorities did not do anything to us the next day, even though we were disrespectful to the old priest and even insulted him by ignoring his lecture.</p>
<p>But Old Han was still not convinced. He met the foreign dog servant on the playground, and he beat the servant, beating him severely; saying that it was nothing to do with the school if we ate grapes.</p>
<p>The school recorded his demerit, the charge was bullying a worker. I remember it that way.</p>
<p>Let him record the demerit, we continued to steal grapes, we ran to a corner of the orchard, a place where people rarely went, and stole; until all the servants in the school carried large buckets and picked them in large quantities, and sent them to the kitchen in large quantities, we stopped stealing.</p>
<p>This happened three years ago, and I still remember it clearly. Looking at the grapes in the soft green light, I miss that simple Old Han very much; but I am not even clear about Old Han's life or death. I remember he was very angry when he left the school, that was the first year after the loss of the Northeast, he had no family support and could not study; he could not even find his home, he had not received a single word from home for a year; and became a person without a home. Because he owed too much money, the kitchen stopped his meals, and he left. He said, "If this place doesn't keep me, there's always a place that will." I asked him where he was going, he said he was going to take some railway trainee exam, but he didn't bring a book, I knew.</p>
<p>I watched the rickshaw pull him and a bundle of bedding down the hillside, all alone.</p>
<p>The grapes in the corner of the desk turned into rickshaw wheels turning in my head.</p>
<h3>Copying Targets</h3>
<p>— Le Jian</p>
<p>Because of staying overnight on the journey, the feeling of homesickness will hang more easily in the heart; accidentally thinking of leaving the market, this place with a bit of mystery, it has already been fourteen years that two hands can't count. Are Father's country fellows and relatives, who have not had news, still living in the market of that prehistoric era?</p>
<p>Fifteen and a half li, today's journey.</p>
<p>In the dim dawn of the morning, the simple shop by the forest, the curling morning smoke on the thatched roof, blended with the comfortable and refreshing autumn wind, weaving a dazzling scenery. In the cold room illuminated by the shell window, my slight sleep was awakened by the long cry of the pheasant and the lowing of the calf. Thinking of the first time I came to stay last night, there was no pheasant, no calf, only then did I feel that these two sounds were so fresh, the morning in the mountains was so fresh.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper is an elderly man, tall and burly, with a "scarecrow" type of face. He is wearing black breeches and a tough, thick homespun belt. It is said that he used to be a镖客 (Biao Ke - armed escort); although he is doing this business now, perhaps he has not forgotten the wandering life of his early years. His demeanor looks like a legendary hero; but talking to him, you only feel that he is approachable, his eyes radiating a chivalrous spirit.</p>
<p>"Master, getting up early!" Seeing him old in the morning, I mechanically made a bow.</p>
<p>"Oh! Getting up early, getting up early." He also similarly selected a bow.</p>
<p>"I say, on the road to the market, there can't be..."</p>
<p>"That, that's not very...but it just comes and goes!"</p>
<p>Again with a feeling of trepidation, ending this conversation: I had long known that this fifteen-and-a-half-mile mountain path was more precipitous; I was unwilling to make a detour again, lengthening this distant journey. My heart of returning is like a flowing arrow, which is unstoppable by trepidation and hesitation. Finally, I packed up my luggage again and hastily set off.</p>
<p>What I saw at first was still the vast plain, with sparse crape myrtles standing tall everywhere, the morning sun climbing on the yellow loess, shining into golden mountain sunshine, and crimson mountain shade. After passing a few scattered tile kilns, and passing through a few tile drying yards, the road gradually led up the mountainside, making detours on the bare mountain, and circling around the mountain slope.</p>
<p>A forest of long-leafed crape myrtles blocked the way ahead, and my heart began to jump nervously. They were just for the sake of making a living, or unwilling to abandon their old nest and go elsewhere, mechanically inheriting the business of their ancestors, attempting to prolong this life. They just hid in this closed, cold mountain and abducted. I am not a merchant escorting goods, I am a wanderer returning with a light body, I have traveled all over the world with a light bag, a young man like me, is he afraid of the unexpected of being kidnapped! I thought.</p>
<p>In the forest, I faintly heard two or three whistles, mixed with obscene, monotonous mountain songs. In an instant, unexpectedly, two men blocked the way, all in ancient clothing, clothing that could only be found in rural opera troupes.</p>
<p>"Hey, going to the market? Untie it, untie it!" They rushed up fiercely.</p>
<p>"There are guns, hey, firearms!" Another snatched my luggage.</p>
<p>They skillfully spread out my luggage, pulled up the clothes and shook them in the air, there was nothing; they searched my body, there was nothing either, they looked at each other frustratedly, kicked the clothes on the ground with one foot, and left contemptuously.</p>
<p>"Poor kid, can't figure it out but has the air of a scholar!" I packed up my luggage and walked out of the forest very borrowedly, the long leaves of the crape myrtle brushed the remaining sound of this building.</p>
<p>The drawn-out sigh and obscene errors rang out again through the mountain village.</p>

<h3>Hesitation</h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>A song like goose down, brought by the tranquil autumn wind from a small school across the street, seemed to make me even more melancholy.</p>
<p>That song, emitted from the sharp vocal cords of those young students, contained a pure and lively tone. However, my narrow heart was jealous and hateful of those songs. In fact, my jealousy and hatred were practical, and useless!</p>
<p>So, I faced the window: drinking in the autumn wind, drinking in melancholy.</p>
<p>When I was young, I did not receive a good education. Following my busy father, running around east and west, it has been endless for so many years. The pomegranate tree planted in front of the courtyard when I was young has grown taller than me. My grandmother's beloved cat, and herself, have also become old and frail with the passage of time. Just take that yellowish-brown cat, its right eye is already blind, and when it walks, it looks like a ghost, the deathly pallor suppressing its actions and breathing...</p>
<p>Ah, everything is aging, even my red wooden washbasin, which I have had since I was a child, is leaking because of old age.</p>
<p>In the dim light, by the morning stream, when eating lunch, I always saw my father yawning so tiredly. Yes, he is also old.</p>
<p>Looking at his yawns, I am deeply afraid:</p>
<p>"When I reach his age, maybe I will spend the whole day lying around..."</p>
<p>As the boring thought flashed through my mind, I returned to my childhood: "I must be a good person!" I often consoled myself like this, and my father often nagged me in a similar way.</p>
<p>So, on my diary, textbooks, or notebooks, I wrote: "Strive to be a good person." And I told my father:</p>
<p>"I want to be an accomplished young man!"</p>
<p>At that time, I firmly believed that my words could be fully realized. I was blindly confused by my own words. I never thought about it: "How can I be an accomplished young man?"</p>
<p>Time has eroded my youth. I am already hesitating on the road to middle age. I am still me! However, my father seems to be old, his nagging is also over, and when I am with him, besides a heavy sigh, I can hardly hear anything. In his heavy sigh, I woke up. I frankly admitted that my thoughts were wrong!</p>
<p>"I can't be as ignorant as my grandmother's cat!" I woke up. However, the heavy iron chains of middle age have already locked me.</p>
<p>"I can't let the heaviness of the iron chains of middle age betray my awakening!" Thinking like that, I seemed to have gained a new environment. But, I don't know how to apply my awakening?</p>
<p>Every day when I hear the lively songs from the school across the street, I become more and more bitter, more and more melancholy.</p>
<p>In just a moment, the singers will catch up with me.</p>
<p>When I bury my heavy head in my hands, my father sighs again. And that clear song seems to be more resonant, more brisk!</p>
<h3>Hosting a Banquet (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Therefore, the rumors about Master Zhu are too numerous to recount: some say he is a smuggler of salt, some say that the Shanghai drug manufacturing organization is located in Master Zhu's mansion, and even more say that Master Zhu colluded with kidnapping bosses on the sea, providing them with a place to hide the kidnapped victims... In fact, Master Zhu has never done anything criminal except try his best to make money. Taking office as an official, earning him one hundred thousand or eighty thousand, this is investing to make a profit, not a crime; he has land, which he leases to tenants to farm, and collects rent at the end of the year. Collecting rent only earns six percent interest, so Master Zhu's measuring bucket is larger than those in the rice shops, which of course cannot be said to be illegal. However, Master Zhu values ​​money too much, for example, when tenants pay rent, there is usually a lunch, eaten from the granary, but Master Zhu only deducts twenty large coins, and pastes a red note in the accounting room: "This house has many tenants, and no food is provided, each person deducts twenty large coins." This is the point where Master Zhu made enemies of people. However, those tenants can only spread rumors, they dare not fail to pay the rent, or be short a single coin; as for any disrespectful incidents towards Master Zhu, that is guaranteed not to happen, because those who come and go from Master Zhu's door are all the top figures in this town.</p>
<p>But Master Zhu is hosting a grand banquet today, the two black doors are wide open, rows of "Silence and Avoidance" signs are lined up on both sides, and a large door lamp hangs in the center, so that people outside the door can see everything clearly. The halls are all decorated with silver, and the sunlight shines so dazzlingly that it confuses people's eyes, and confuses people's hearts. Those top figures, of course, arrived at the Zhu mansion early in sedan chairs, which is not surprising. What is strange; according to the errand boy who sent out the invitations: this matter is very strange, Master Zhu even invited those big tenants, it looks like there will be ten or so tables of good wine and food! This is naturally a strange thing, among those who received the invitations, there was even a barefoot person (Note 3) who did not know a single character, the day before, there was some commotion in the town, everyone ran around telling each other, and everyone was suspicious of Master Zhu's sudden grand banquet, wondering if something unfortunate was about to befall everyone. Everyone gathered in the Fuxing Teahouse, and talked for a whole day, but still could not come to a conclusion. The timid ones advocated not going, but if something bad were to happen, they would not be able to escape Master Zhu's grasp anyway. Then, some people advocated going to disturb him with a big meal of meat and fish, because the country people can't eat such good wine and dishes all year round!</p>
<p>Thus: barefoot, wearing torn gowns, filled Master Zhu's flower hall, and the secret inside the two black doors was finally seen by them a little. Everything was fresh, unseen before, and even the big fish and meat tasted better than what they cooked at home. Everyone ate and drank until the wine had passed half a round, and the local bailiff stood up to speak. Usually, he and a group of barefoot people could only sit in the back accounting room, but now he put on a robe and gown, and said with a decent smile:</p>
<p>"Today Master Zhu is inviting you to drink wine, this is really... a very good thing, because, now the province is going to levy land surtax, in the town... gentlemen, because, Master Zhu is fair in his dealings, he has already... Master Zhu has reported it, Master Zhu has become the land surtax official, for you, it is also a good thing, so, please drink wine, everyone should help Master Zhu, if the county, summons you to ask questions, you have to say that Master Zhu is good... Master Zhu is good... well, everyone drink another cup of wine, understand? Master Zhu is good..." The bailiff stammered and only said half of what he had planned for a long time, he looked at Master Zhu, wondering if he had said anything wrong?</p>
<p>Master Zhu nodded. Master Zhu is good, those barefoot people also know, this land surtax official is another good side income. But this banquet was making trouble in everyone's stomach, and no one nodded.</p>
<p>Understand? Everyone understands very clearly.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Granary means landlord.</p>
<p>(Note 2) Ten halls and nine courtyards, describes the width of the house, not that there are ten houses and nine courtyards.</p>
<p>(Note 3) Barefoot people, means looking down on farmers.</p>
<h3>Moving</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>With each move, my mood changes, and I always sigh because of it, why do I always bother myself with some insignificant things. In the past three years, I can't remember how many times I've moved. I've lived in lively places and quiet places, and then from quiet places to lively places. When I live in a quiet area, if I don't go out all day, it's like I've forgotten the world. All I can hear is the faint sound of fruit trees swaying in the breeze outside the window. I feel too lonely, and I feel as if I've been abandoned by everyone, so I move away. When I move, of course, I move to a very lively environment. The street may be right under the window, and from early in the morning every day, the noise of various vehicles continues until late at night, and my ears are always buzzing. I simply can't do anything, and my mood can't be calmed down no matter what. I gradually become irritable, and I feel that if I delay any longer, I might become neurasthenic, so I move again. This time I move from a lively place to a quiet place. The new house is far from the city streets, and the noise of cars can only be faintly heard late at night, and it is already very scattered. This is completely suitable for me to need a longer period of quiet mood to brew. And behind the house is the neighbor's garden. Autumn is already deep, and there are no flowers to be seen. On the lawn, only tall sycamores stand proudly, and although many of the leaves are yellow, they have fallen all over the ground, showing some haggardness; but on sunny days, it can still cast a shadow on the ground. I hear a rustling sound, and then it falls down with a swish. I know that the sycamore leaves have been ravaged by a merciless wind god.</p>
<p>For several months, I have been exhausted and eager to find a place to rest greatly. Now the house is very suitable. If there are no accidents or anything necessary, I plan to live here for a longer period of time and not move easily anymore. In fact, my moving is very simple. There are no cumbersome things like suitcases, or even a few quilts. I can move immediately if I want to. It's just moving a person to another place. What's annoying is looking for a house. I often run around all day, and my legs are numb, but I still can't find a place that satisfies me. Once the house is found, things are over. Thinking back to the first move in the past three years, there were always cars and cars of luggage. At that time, the hardship of moving was really something. After that, every time I moved, there were fewer items, and gradually it was reduced to just a bachelor's body. Earlier, because I was worried about too many things, I was really unwilling to move, and it was also not easy to move. When I had nothing outside my body, and it was just me alone, the house could be moved. From the matter of moving, I often can't help but reminisce about the traces of my personal life during these days, and the changes. I feel a little lost; during these days I have lived in cramped pigeon cage-like attics, lived in foreign houses with beautiful interiors, lived in dark places where I couldn't even see the sunlight during the day, and also lived in places where there were elevators to replace my steps. I have seen many different neighbors, and seen the lives of many different neighbors. And myself, in the midst of moving back and forth, my feelings have gradually faded, and my thoughts have gradually become gloomy. The movement of the house is like a person's experience, sometimes facing the sun, but sometimes only seeing dark shadows. After a few more changes, I'm afraid people will be old!</p>

<p>In the ballroom, I saw a black-faced foreign youth distributing cards to a large group of dancers. The card was printed with "Wu Zhanda" and in the upper right corner were three lines of tiny characters: "×× Morning Post Reporter, Broadcasting × Report Editor, Broadcasting News Special Reporter"</p>
<p>Recently, the Rose Troupe has been simply surrounded by so-called self-proclaimed "reporters," including the editors of Wuge Society, the editor-in-chief of the Singer Pictorial, the editor of the Broadcasting Daily, a reporter for the World Morning Post, and a special reporter for Broadcasting News; there is also a Mr. La Qing, but the Shen Bao, Shishi Xin Bao, and Xinwen Ye Bao editors have not deigned to visit.</p>
<p>The Modern New Song Collection has been published. Although the content is completely plagiarized from Twelve Books and Lonely Hearts, it is several times better than Nightingale Song Selection, 1935 Modern Songs, etc. The disadvantage is that the copied songs have not been corrected. For example, in songs like To Modern Miss, Little Wren, Silver River Twin Stars, How Can I Not Think of Him, etc., all the original errors are still wrong and mistaken in the same way.</p>
<p>Yan Hua suggested to Ding Song to organize a group. If it can be realized, I wish: the third breakup (first Jin Yan, second Liu Xue'an) a success!</p>
<p>If you have Singer Pictorial issues 1, 2, and 3, you don't need to buy the Star Song Collection, because all the content is basically the same, the so-called template is also.</p>
<p>A "Dream Lover" on page 171 of the Modern New Song Collection has only two-thirds of the song, with a head and body but no tail. I don't know where to continue singing from. I think the editor must be an amateur.</p>
<p>Yan Hua wrote an article "The Wandering Poet" in the third issue of Singer Pictorial, recalling the beloved Pei Rong; Yan Fei wrote an article "Come Back! Li" in the same issue, saying that the soul follows "Li." Can these two brothers and sisters' two romances be revealed? (Above Copper Thunder)</p>
<p>Liu Yile of the Guanyin Society, he is gone once and for all. I don't know why he played Wang Po, who is so flirtatious, in Water Margin Wu Song?</p>
<p>The newly-entered singing world Fang Lan, especially likes to sing Hu Die's songs, and broadcasts and sings them on the Buddhist Music Radio Station every day, gaining a lot of praise.</p>
<p>Amitabha Ye Ying and Little Angel Ye Hong said to Little Zhu, the president of Era: "We are going abroad with Fatty Sister, and we will come back later." When they left, they gave Era Society a reluctant and affectionate look!</p>
<p>The Buddhist Music Radio Station's program is about to be changed, and the Era Opera Society may be changed to broadcast starting at 5:15.</p>
<p>Miss Yan Qun's attitude is solemn. It is also due to her hard work in cultivating art that she was able to successfully play Pan Jinlian in Wu Song. These two days she has been playing Sun Da Niang while sick, and she is a little less energetic. Because of her illness, she will be energetic in a couple of days.</p>
<p>After the Era Opera Society's drama group finishes broadcasting Wu Song, the scripts prepared to be broadcast are "Good Wife, Diao Chan, Yang Guifei." Which one is decided? Seeking the audience's consent. (Above Era Society)</p>
<p>The "China Harmonica World, Issue 12," published by the China Harmonica Music Weekly Society at No. 11, Lane 157, Anren Street, Xinbeimen, in the city of this port, was published on Double Ten Day. The content of this issue includes Qi Qi's "Practice Method of Accompaniment," Yu Yuxing's "Discussion of Semiautomatic Harmonica," Bao Mingshan's "Harmonica's," Zhao Xiaodong's "Harmonica Repair Method," Dianhua's "News from the Overseas Harmonica World," Bao Yunguan's "All Japan</p>

<h3>Tianyi's "Sea Burial" Newcomer Fu Baolu</h3>
<p>— Bai Yun Sends a Report</p>
<h3>Yihua Presents "Signed Souvenir Book"</h3>
<p>— Bai Mu</p>
<p>Since the 6th National Games opened on Double Ten Day at the newly built sports field in the central district of this city, the eyes of the whole country have been focused on every athlete, and everyone hopes that they can establish good results and make contributions to China's sports world. At the same time, the psychology of worshiping heroes has also increased its heat, and the most obvious manifestation of this psychology is the request for signatures. Their meaning is nothing more than wanting to keep this signature as a souvenir to commemorate and not forget, but in general, most people at the venue request the athletes' signatures, and because they have no signature books prepared, they all temporarily take out messy pieces of paper from their sides, and the lack of elegance is self-evident. In view of this, Yihua Film Company specially printed 100,000 copies of the "Signature Commemoration" booklet and distributed them in the venue in recent days. Because it is small and exquisite and very beautiful, the recipients all regard it as a precious treasure. Now the company is worried that it may not be able to distribute it universally, so if anyone has not received this booklet, they can attach half a cent of postage and send it to the company's propaganda department on Nao Tal Road, and they will send a booklet immediately.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of Shanghai Zhenhua Paint Co., Ltd.</h3>
<p>Zhenhua Paint Co., Ltd. was founded in the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918). The founder was the former manager, Mr. Shao Jinqing. Mr. Shao believed that paint was a necessity for building materials, with huge amounts of money flowing out of the country annually. Therefore, he collaborated with Mr. Yue Zhenbao, Mr. Wang Yunfu, and others to establish a manufacturing plant to reclaim these profits. After more than ten years of struggle and painstaking management, it finally became a leader in China's paint industry, adding a unique brilliance to the national product manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>The company is a joint-stock company with a capital of 200,000 national currency units. It has nine directors and supervisors, who form a board of directors. Under the board, there is a general manager and an assistant manager, each executing all affairs. The current general manager is Mr. Qin Jingcheng, and the assistant manager is Mr. Song Peidao. The manufacturing plant is located at Tanzi Bay, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, Shanghai, covering an area of over ten acres. It faces the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway in the front and relies on the Suzhou River in the back, making both land and water transportation extremely convenient. The factory buildings are constructed with the latest style of cement and steel frames. Inside, they are divided into sections for thick paint, blending, oil refining, varnish, water powder, lead powder, and red lead. All machinery is powered by electricity, employing over a hundred workers. A branch factory is set up in Tianjin and is currently undergoing expansion. There are a total of four distribution offices. The main distribution office is located at 478-480 North Suzhou Road, Shanghai. Branch distribution offices are located at Baocheng Road in Hankou, Jiankang Road in Nanjing, and Xinmin Road in Hangzhou. There are over fifty managers and distributors in various ports. The sales destinations include not only China but also the Nanyang Islands, British and Dutch territories, and places like Roro (likely a misspelling). Overseas Chinese compatriots are mostly happy to purchase the products.</p>
<p>The products include:</p>
<p>(1) Thick paint, (2) Blending paint, (3) Anti-rust paint, (4) House paint, (5) Sanding paint, (6) Automotive enamel, (7) Quick-drying enamel, (8) Varnish, (9) Wood paint, (10) Refined paint, (11) Pore filler, (12) Water powder, (13) Red lead, (14) Lead powder, (15) Paint oil, etc., totaling more than ten types. The trademarks are Flying Tiger, Double Flag, Three Sheep, Tai Chi, Invincible, and Peony, totaling six types. The annual production volume reaches over 2,600 tons. The most famous products are superior white paint, boiled oil, improved gold paint, quick-drying enamel, and the recently released water powder paint. Except for a portion of pigments ordered from European and American countries, the remaining raw materials are all domestic products.</p>
<p>In addition to the paint manufacturing section, the factory also has a chemical testing department that specializes in analyzing the composition of various raw materials and products and researching methods for improvement. Furthermore, the engineering department specializes in designing and undertaking various paint projects for all sectors. Recently, they have compiled a kind of artistic pattern, which makes painted houses elegant and beautiful, and is also a unique feature.</p>
<p>The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, due to the company's excellent products, once requested the Ministry of Navy, Army and Air Force, as well as the provincial and municipal governments, to instruct their subordinates to adopt them as much as possible. Currently, the Jinghu, Huhangyong, Beining, Jinpu, Jiaoji, Pingsui, Longhai, Daoqing, and Nanxun railways, as well as the construction bureaus and public works bureaus of various provinces and cities, post offices, and China Merchants Group, all adopt them. Even foreign-operated companies such as the Shanghai British Tramway Company and Taikoo Dockyard frequently use them to paint vehicles and ships, adding a lot of glory to national products.</p>
<p>The establishment of the company is entirely based on the principle of promoting national products. It is never complacent about various products and strives for excellence. In the future, it should particularly work hard on research to ensure that all products become even better.</p>
<h3>Talking About Fire Bricks</h3>
<p>Fire bricks are extremely important in the industrial sector, especially in heavy industry and kiln-fired industries like enamel and glass. Ceramic products have a very long history in our country. In theory, the manufacturing and application of related refractory materials should have significant advantages. However, the reality shows us that China's industrial sector is always stuck in old ways and is not easy to improve. Even considering the kilns in Yixing, the most famous place for kiln products in our country, and the kiln houses in Jiangxi porcelain manufacturing factories, they are still built with locally made earthen bricks and tiles. In recent years, the mechanical industry has become increasingly developed. Almost every factory has a boiler as a necessity. The materials for building furnaces are definitely not something that old earthen bricks and tiles can handle. The importance of fire bricks is increasing daily. Until recently, the source of fire bricks completely depended on foreign countries. Since the establishment of the Kailuan Coal Mines, due to its own needs, it set up a fire brick manufacturing factory in Tangshan (where there are excellent raw materials nearby). Later, due to the pressing needs of the outside world, things fell into place, and it became their side business. Everyone knows that Kailuan is a foreign-owned mining company. Seeing that money was still flowing out, the Chinese recently started to manufacture domestic fire bricks.</p>
<p>The main raw materials for fire bricks are a mixture of natural refractory stone and kaolin clay. Our country has excellent raw materials everywhere, so there is no need to rely on foreign countries. The most important condition for fire bricks is that they must have particularly strong refractoriness and pressure resistance. The durability of each boiler and kiln, and the quality of its products, all depend on how these two strengths determine its fate. Due to the importance of the relationship, the industrial sector is extremely strict in procurement. Due to the lack of precision in technology and raw materials, the quality of domestic fire bricks varies greatly, which is often criticized by industrialists who promote national products, and there is still a tendency to trust foreign goods.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Zu'an of Dinghai founded the China Kiln Industry Company in the 21st year of the Republic (1932). Through four years of hard work, the Earth Brand fire bricks produced have, in addition to the two main conditions of high refractoriness and high pressure resistance, paid more attention to reducing shrinkage and ensuring the accuracy of custom shapes. It has established a very good reputation in the domestic industrial sector. A simple introduction is given here to seek common promotion and reverse the fate of domestic fire bricks.</p>
<h3>Domestic Tar Felt</h3>
<p>— Loss</p>
<p>Tar felt is an essential material for preventing leaks on roofs, occupying an important position in the construction industry. In the past, our country did not produce it, so all requirements were met by imports. The annual loss is more than millions of dollars. Now, engineer Mr. Cao Kedong has been researching and carefully manufacturing in Tianjin for many years. He has now raised funds to establish the Jianhua Industrial Company in Tianjin, specializing in the production of various oil felts to meet the needs of various constructions in our country. The price is low and the quality is good, enough to seize the position of foreign goods and replace them. In various ports in North China, the sales are extremely wide, and all owners praise each other. Now, in response to the needs of major construction projects in Shanghai, a resident office has been specially established at No. 41, Lane 2, East De'an Lane, North Shanxi Road, and major hardware stores in this port are entrusted with sales, so that those who purchase for various construction projects can easily procure them. It is hoped that major architects and construction factories will enthusiastically promote them to increase the glory of national products and plug the leaks. This is what we deeply hope for.</p>
<h3>After Visiting the Gymnasium and Swimming Pool Built by the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, for the sake of promoting sports, built a gymnasium and swimming pool in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China (1934) to provide the citizens of this city with opportunities to exercise their bodies in their spare time and to have legitimate entertainment venues for sports competitions. The Sixth National Games was held in Shanghai this time, and it was a great opportunity to use this building. On the day of the completion of the above two buildings, the reporter visited the interior. Most of the construction materials used were domestic products. For example, the steel windows were contracted by the China Copper and Iron Factory. It is said that all the steel windows of the Nanjing Ministry of Transportation Building were also manufactured by this factory. They are fine, strong and very durable. The mosaics in the swimming pool are produced by Xingye Tile Company.</p>
<p>(1) Gymnasium, located north of the swimming pool, facing east. The house style adopts a mixed style of modern and Chinese architecture. All exterior walls are made of red bricks and have artificial stone carvings, so the appearance is very majestic, and the interior is exquisite and magnificent. It was designed by architect Dong Dayou of the Municipal Central District Construction Committee and built by Chengtai Construction Factory. The main entrance of the hall has a lobby ticket office, a hall, men's and women's toilets, aisles, passageways, basketball courts, gyms, offices, meeting rooms, dressing rooms, bathrooms, sports equipment rooms, kitchens, and boiler rooms. The boiler rooms were contracted by Guangyonghe Boiler Factory. The arrangement is orderly. The grandstand has a capacity of 2,500 seated and 1,500 standing.</p>
<p>(2) Swimming Pool, built according to the dimensions of American university swimming and competition regulations. The outdoor style has grandstands built on all four sides, with a capacity of 5,000 seated and 1,000 standing. The length of the pool is eighty feet, the width is twenty feet, the depth of the pool is two feet at the shallowest end, and twenty-one (the rest is missing), the capacity (missing). The bottom and sides of the pool are paved with mosaics, clean and often. The water filtration and lighting equipment in the pool are particularly characteristic. Next to this pool, a small swimming pool is built for children to swim.</p>
<p>Inside the pool, from the main entrance, there is a hall ticket office, a furnace room, men's and women's toilets, vertical and horizontal aisles, a living room, an office, a cloakroom, a lounge, a swimming equipment room, a dressing room, a sales office, etc. The layout is thoughtful, tidy and elegant, and it is the best-equipped swimming pool in China.</p>
<h3>History of Steel Window Factories in Our Country</h3>
<p>Our country's steel window factories started in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China (1925). The earliest founder was China Copper and Iron Factory. In addition to specializing in the manufacture of steel windows and steel doors, the factory also contracted various copper and iron projects. The general manager, Mr. Li Xianyao, once served as the Chinese manager of a British steel window factory for more than ten years, so he has in-depth research on the construction principles of steel windows. Afterwards, he set up his own factory at No. 513, Haifang Road, covering an area of four acres. Recently, due to the development of business, a second factory was added at Song Park Road, Liuying Road. The equipment in the factory is all new-style machinery, and all management adopts scientific management methods. Therefore, the products are excellent and fast. Usually, the number of employed workers is about 160 to 170. For example, the National Government Ministry of Transportation Building, the National Government Civil Service Office Building, the Supreme Court Building, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs official residence building, the official residence of Chairman Chiang, the Executive Yuan office building, the offices of various bureaus of the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Central Transportation Bureau, the Huaye Building, the residence of Mr. Wang Boqun, the residence of Mr. Wang Jingwei, the residence of Mr. Kong Xiangxi, the residence of Mr. Chen Gongbo, the residence of Mr. Zeng Zhongming, the residence of Mr. Hu Yunqiu, the residence of Mr. Ye Chu, the Central Health Administration, the Central Epidemic Prevention Office, the Central Medical Administration College, the Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium, the China Leprosy Sanatorium, the Shanghai Municipal Hygiene Laboratory, the Central Bank Warehouse, the Hongkou Bank of China, the Hongkou Four Lines Savings Society, the Bank of Communications Warehouse, the Bank of China Warehouse, the Qingdao Jin Cheng Bank, the Qingdao Dalu Bank, the Jinan Dalu Bank, the Tianchu MSG Factory, the Tianli Light Gas Factory, the Shanghai Municipal Gymnasium, the Shanghai Municipal Swimming Pool, the News Newspaper Office, and the steel windows used in this museum were all contracted and installed by (missing), and they have been there for many years (missing) bad, enough (missing) the excellence of the factory's products.</p>
<h3>New Products of Yizhong Fuji Machinery, Porcelain and Electricity Company</h3>
<p>Domestic Glazed Wall Tiles Debut, Quality and Color Exceeding Imported Products</p>
<p>Fuji Company is entirely invested and operated by Chinese people. Its initial products were only (missing) in (missing) machine (missing) materials, such as (missing) pressure devices, oil opening (missing), (missing) lamp porcelain materials, etc., sold (missing) domestically, long (missing) reputation, (missing) From the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), the company</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>Seeing the rise of the domestic construction industry, and the fact that materials were all dependent on foreign countries, they devoted themselves to the creation of building materials. The products such as paving mosaics and magnetic tiles are of solid quality and beauty, and even surpass imported products, and have long been praised by the construction industry. Recently, it has also replenished the second factory, hired engineering experts who have studied in the United States, and made special efforts to create, in addition to the original products, a new type of (glazed) wall tiles, which are strong in quality and beautiful in color. Foreign goods (missing) but retreated, and domestic products are especially unparalleled, adding a unique brilliance to domestic building materials. The company's first and second factories have a total of seven new-style (missing), which can produce more than 700 square feet of mosaic porcelain and more than 400 square feet of glazed wall tiles per month. The Four Lines Savings Society Building, which has already been completed, and the Wing On Company's seventeen-story new building, which is under construction, are the first to adopt them. Other giant buildings under construction, such as the Great Sun Company on Nanjing Road, are also scrambling to the company, looking at samples and ordering goods. Generally, construction operators are all considered to be the latest and most beautiful building materials in 1935. The company's first factory is located in Yangjing, Pudong, and the second factory is located on Huo Bilan Road. The general office is located at No. 89 Fuzhou Road. All products have samples, and all sectors are welcomed to visit and purchase. The reception is said to be diligent.</p>
<h3>An Overview of the Huaxin Brick and Tile Company</h3>
<p>Huaxin Brick and Tile Company was founded in the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922). At that time, the scale was not complete, and there was only one type of large flat tile. Later, Mr. Liu Zixian, the manager of the company, left Taishan Brick and Tile Company and came to preside over the company, which made major reforms. In the past five or six years, the scale has been complete, and there have been various types of flat tiles, Spanish tiles, barrel tiles, and Chinese temple-style barrel tiles. Mr. Liu has long served as the chief engineer of Taishan Company. He has excellent technology and rich experience. All products made by him are exquisite and unique, and are praised by the construction industry.</p>
<p>In the spring of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933), Mr. Liu saw that the cement flower tiles on the cars were mostly bad and could not be used for a long time, so he studied them carefully and gained a lot of experience. Therefore, he expanded the scope, purchased the latest type of (missing) press with 2,500 pounds per square inch, and used high-quality flint and pigments to make beautiful flower tiles, which are no different from foreign goods.</p>
<p>Huaxin flower tiles have accurate dimensions, solid texture, clear patterns, and a smooth tile surface, which are unmatched by other flower tiles. Since its sales, it has spread all over the ports. The most notable are the Nanjing National Government Auditorium, Chairman Lin's villa, the Central Party Department Party History, the Capital Hotel, the Jiangsu Bank, the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, the Aviation School Sports Ground, the Dongwu University Affiliated Middle School in Huzhou, the Nanchang Provincial Government Office Building, and the Aviation School, the Jiujiang Central Bank, the Shanghai French Concession Public Works Bureau, the Lagrange Chinese Public School, the residences of senior officers of the Bank of China, Mr. Du Yuesheng's villa, and the Da Sun Company, which is under construction, all use the company's flower tiles for paving. The popularity of the company's products can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Domestic Asbestos Products in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In recent years, China's industrial construction and machinery have become increasingly developed, and the demand for asbestos products has been increasing day by day. Because demand exceeds supply, the loss of imports each year is no less than millions of dollars. In the beginning, I didn't know that there were asbestos manufacturers in China. Recently, due to the high price of foreign goods and the slow delivery, I had to investigate in China to see if there were asbestos manufacturers in China. After... three weeks, the first one found was "Zhen'an Asbestos Factory", and the second one was "Dadong Asbestos Factory". Before discovering each factory, I always thought that the asbestos products bought from hardware stores were foreign goods. After investigation, it was not the case. More than half of what hardware stores sell are bought in China, because Chinese goods are not inferior to foreign goods, and the effectiveness is the same. In particular, the price is half cheaper than foreign goods! Sometimes foreign goods managers, for fear of being fined for delayed delivery, the first remedy is to order goods from Chinese factories and change the signs to deceive the users. This proves that Chinese goods are applicable, and further proves that people who blindly believe in foreign goods are blindly following. Now I will write down a few points below for the reference of the construction industry:</p>
<p>Raw Materials Asbestos is a kind of stony ore, the color has red, white, green, black, yellow, etc., the length is different, the longest is more than two feet, the shortest is less than an inch, the color is the best with white and soft. The stone blocks are mined from the mine, and after a series of refining and grinding procedures by the manufacturer, the result is a fibrous material selected from a hard stone layer; this kind of material is asbestos, its characteristics are non-combustible, winter is warm, summer is cold, and it is insulated and hemostatic. It is very easy to test the authenticity of asbestos. Just burn it with fire and you will immediately get a definite answer.</p>
<p>Mining Area In addition to a small part of Sichuan Province, the asbestos mining area in Hebei Province (missing) the widest, and the output is the most abundant in Laiyuan. The Sichuan Province mining area is difficult to exploit and the transportation is inconvenient, so it has not been exploited, because after exploitation, the value of transportation to the mainland is too far from the Laiyuan goods. The supply of asbestos raw materials in the country now completely relies on Laiyuan's output. The company that holds the mining rights of the Laiyuan mining area is Tianjin Zhenye Asbestos Factory.</p>
<p>Factories In Shanghai, the largest commercial port in China; there are many factories and water and land terminals; it is impossible to find a complete asbestos product factory, and Dadong is more complete than the general vendors selling asbestos mud, but Dadong is only limited to asbestos pipes and asbestos bricks. Other goods are still lacking. Recently, the products of Zhenye Asbestos Factory, which was established by Tianjin, are indeed complete, because its factory has mines and the machinery is more complete, so there are many kinds of products, but its manufacturing department is in Tianjin, and Zhenye's goods are cheaper.</p>
<p>Types There are many types of asbestos products. To divide them in detail, there are more than a hundred types. The current Chinese products include the following: asbestos raw rope, asbestos square rope, asbestos lead wire raw rope, asbestos lead wire square rope, asbestos various rubber core packing, asbestos various lead powder packing, asbestos loose rope, the above goods are all from 3/8 inch diameter to 3 inches, asbestos wire is from 2.5 mm to 3/8 inch, asbestos paper board is from 2.5 mm thick to 4/8 inch, asbestos brick, asbestos pipe, asbestos tile, asbestos belt, asbestos mud, asbestos gloves, asbestos shoe covers, asbestos cloth, asbestos clothes, asbestos pants, asbestos vest, asbestos hair cap, asbestos various washers, asbestos pillow, asbestos fiber, asbestos furnace opening, asbestos lamp wick, etc., each item is measured by foot or by pound, each item's humidity, tensile strength, and fire power are the same as foreign goods.</p>
<p>Uses Asbestos has great uses. In addition to the large sales market for building materials, asbestos is also an indispensable thing for machinery, boilers, trains, warships, shipyards, airplanes, ordnance factories, mints, yarn factories, vaults, fire brigades, various factories, and even safes.</p>
<p>The above sections are just written casually based on what I know, but I dare not talk nonsense about the details of the asbestos root, I hope that the gentlemen in the domestic asbestos industry will express their opinions more, to increase the knowledge of all sectors of society about asbestos, and it is also enough to promote and sell it.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Shanghai Tai Kee Asbestos Factory</h3>
<p>Founding Overview The factory was founded in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926). In the beginning, the factory used asbestos coating, (namely, commonly known as paper and cypress mud) and relied on foreign countries a lot, and the annual loss was extremely considerable. Because its manufacture is simple, it initiated the establishment of a factory to manufacture it by itself. Then, it gradually invented asbestos magnesium rust powder, magnesium rust block, and magnesium rust pipe, etc. In addition to supplying most of the factories, it also occupies an important position for the needs of the construction industry and sanitation engineering with the trend of the times and the improvement of science. It is indeed a sharp weapon to resist foreign goods and a glorious page of national products. The factory has expanded year by year, and the management occupies several acres of land, and has become a giant in the asbestos industry.</p>
<p>Domestic Stone The raw materials of the factory are mostly from Sichuan and the north, and the attached supplies are also from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which can be called completely domestic goods. It is definitely not the same as other kinds of crafts, which are remanufactured with foreign raw materials and called domestic goods.</p>
<p>Excellent Manufacturing The factory's manufacturing motivation is electric machinery, such as rolling bullets, mixing, pressing tops, baking spray, bleaching, and models, all designed and manufactured by themselves, so most of the products are made by machinery, which are uniform and tidy, and there is no drawback of unevenness.</p>
<p>Product Features First, let's talk about the most common asbestos coating. Generally, the white ones manufactured on the market are mostly mixed with a small amount of raw materials. This kind is not only unusable, but also requires more than ten pounds per square foot according to the usage calculation, while the factory only needs seven pounds. If the same price, the actual use of the factory is cost-effective and reliable. This section must be paid attention to by users. Secondly, it must have "firmness" and "resistance". The factory's raw materials are of high quality, the tendons are long and the strength is sufficient, and each package contains rich raw materials and good adhesion. Therefore, once it is coated on boilers or water pipes, it is unusually "firm", and there is absolutely no drawback of difficult work and patterns. All engineering that involves coating boilers, water pipes, and fireproof insulation requires "sufficient resistance". The hot steam in boilers and water pipes will not leak out, which can save fuel, and the vaults and silver boxes will not be invaded by fire, which can ensure eternal peace. As for magnesium rust powder, magnesium rust block, magnesium rust pipe, and other raw materials, because the value is higher than asbestos and coatings, the effect is even greater. Looking back at the many large projects of the factory, the results are all satisfactory, which is ironclad proof. I dare to introduce it as above.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Taishan Brick and Tile Company</h3>
<p>Taishan Brick and Tile Company was founded in the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921) by founders Huang Shoumin, Qian Xinzhi, Nie Yuntai, Hu Xuanming and others with a capital of 50,000 yuan to open a factory in Jiashan, Zhejiang to manufacture ordinary blue and red bricks and tiles. Due to good management, the products were quite popular in society. Soon, with the rise of architecture in Shanghai, new-style bricks and tiles all came from foreign countries. It was planned to imitate them and compete with them. Therefore, on the one hand, people were sent to the United States to investigate and practice to further their studies. On the other hand, the share capital was expanded to one million yuan, with a paid-up capital of 250,000 yuan. The second factory was selected to be built in Xinlonghua, Shanghai, purchasing a total of 200 acres of land, building twelve American-style kiln piers, and various manufacturing machines were also purchased from the United States. The original engine was purchased from Germany. New-style equipment such as heating rooms using hot air and electric meters controlling kiln temperature were all available. At that time, the products of both factories were better than those of other companies, and they successively won the highest-class medals from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Commodity Exhibition, and the Jiangsu Provincial Commodity Exhibition. In the spring of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926), the company's unique thin-style bricks were born, which were magnificent, beautiful, strong, and durable. People from all walks of life praised them. The great buildings in Shanghai and the capital, such as the twenty-two-story Four Lines Savings Society, the Broadway Building, the eighteen-story Junling Building, and the new buildings of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, and the Central Hospital and the Department of Health, almost all used Taishan facing bricks. A section chief of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau wrote that the most innovative domestic materials in the past twenty years should be the thin-style facing bricks, which is indeed a correct statement. The National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government both rewarded the creation, so they specially gave Taishan Company a ten-year patent for manufacturing thin-style facing bricks. Taishan Company's red tiles and blue tiles are also the best of their kind, so it is not without reason that the market calls the best tiles Taishan tiles. Recently, in order to expand, the company has specially hired porcelain experts who graduated from the United States as technicians to research and improve products, and added two giant kiln piers to specialize in firing glazed bricks and tiles, art tiles, and new products such as Taishan stones, which proves that the company's general manager, Mr. Huang Shoumin, is dedicated to his work and strives for excellence. The future development is unlimited.</p>
<p>"Locks" are indispensable building materials. A metal factory specializes in manufacturing all kinds of tumbler locks, such as wooden door locks, steel door locks (missing) door locks, cabinet door locks, drawer locks, steel tool locks, safe locks, steel window locks, and other more than 30 kinds of good quality and low price. They are not inferior to foreign goods and are displayed on the table of the association.</p>
