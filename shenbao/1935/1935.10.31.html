<p>— 羅馬通信</p>
<p>意大利與阿比西尼亞之戰事、已於十月二日「非正式的」開始、所謂非正式的開始者、卽「不宣而戰」之另一說法雙方在事實上、已經砲火接觸、肉搏死鬥、而為投合一般口頭主張非戰者之心理起見、乃摒戰爭二字而勿言、藉此並為避免擔負從事戰爭之法律上的責任、意大利於二日下午舉行全國總動員大演習、同日卽在菲洲「抵抗」阿比西尼亞、在黑人帝國之天空上舉行大轟炸、陸軍亦同時分路前進、由是瀰天戰禍、乃從此開始矣、戰事開始後之第四日、意大利卽佔領阿比西尼亞之阿杜華、（Adua）其地在阿國西北部、與意屬菲洲埃來脫里亞相近、四十年前（一八九六年三月一日）意軍曾左右翼互失連絡、被阿國擊敗於此、結果簽訂和約、承允阿國獨立（在此以前、阿為意之保護國）此在意人視之固為一　恥辱、而以恢復古代羅馬帝國光榮自命之法西斯黨政府、則尤謀早日重佔其地、以洩積忿、此次佔領之日、（本月六日）週為星期、報紙全體停版、全由無錢電將此喜訊傳佈民衆、其後中央黨部亦將宣傳部之十四號公報（在近代意大利歷史上、此公報已成為不朽之文件）廣為刊印、分貼街衢、一時遍見「阿杜華是我們的了」之標語與口號、民衆集合成羣、游行街頭、高呼口號、遍城家戶、均張二色國旗、以慶勝利、入晚、更有羣衆手持火把、到處集隊示威、其中以無名英雄墓前之威尼司廣塲最為熱鬧、　大利民　、原　多血質、熱烈浪漫、愛國心强、此次重佔阿道瓦、將四十年之恥辱、一日洗除、且為進佔阿比西尼亞第一次之勝利、無怪民衆歡　如狂矣、</p>
<p>雙方開戰　三四日、阿比西尼亞　失一人城、固係意大利之軍力雄壯所致、而可比西尼亞之曾否劇烈抵抗、則為此　　士共同懷疑與探討之問題、關於阿杜華之陷落、據有二說一為意大利曾以勇猛之空軍先施重量轟炸、陸軍乃總之而前進但仍遇阿比西尼亞車隊之還擊雙方兵士以短劍及槍刺肉搏、英京泰晤士報曾　為Hand-to-hand　Battle、結果均有嚴重死傷、(意死七百人、阿死一千三百人以上）另一說則為阿杜華在阿此西尼亞之西北　邊境上、雖係大城、實非要地、　日離阿京阿迭斯阿貝巴頗遠、阿王明知當年意軍曾被擊於其地、此次必不惜一切犧牲以重佔其地與其為此一城而大損軍力、何如保留元氣、以謀內地之主力戰、是以放棄阿杜華、或為阿國預定之軍事計劃、惟無論如何、意大利終已佔此城市、且足為鼓躍民衆激勵軍心繼續前進之良好宣傳工具、就事論之、實係極大勝利、殆已無可諱言、所可顧慮者、佔領阿杜華雖係一大勝利、（近日且繼續前進、阿國鐵格拉區全境、殆已為意軍所覆沒、）而繼此勝利以後之遭遇的困難、其應付之不易則與日俱長也、</p>
<p>以軍事方面而論、無論上述兩說、孰是孰非、阿比西尼亞之猛烈抵抗意軍、則為一般人所共認、在兵器上、意大利有飛機大砲及一切最新式之科學殺人工具、至必要時、或有較達姆彈及瓦斯毒氣更烈之軍器、亦未可知、阿國對於此點、無對比相抗之可能、惟阿國多山、菲洲氣候、不利於飛機與普通兵士者、形勢亦非可輕社而其人民兇勇好鬥、驃悍善戰、意人雖熱烈、對面遇之、當亦為不易應付之敵手、但近代戰事、非僅為體力的鬥爭實亦為智力與科學工具工鬥爭、在此點上、實為阿國之最大弱點、四十年前、阿國或能制服意軍於一時、而在四十年後之今日、則意大利之進步、實足克制阿比西尼亞數十倍以上、阿國固無空軍實力可言、（聞祇有飛機六架、其中兩架且不能作戰、）不足以當意國之一擊、卽以陸軍方面而言、意國軍隊雖無深厚之戰爭經騐、（此次在菲洲作戰者、大多係二十餘歲上下之靑年、上次大戰退伍軍人、雖已自動請求參加、並已蒙墨索里尼承諾准予組織泰伐師」、但尙未出發、）特平日訓練有素、紀律與戰鬥力、均屬上乘、而為愛國情緒所激、勇猛善戰、或亦非阿國所能抗也、</p>
<p>是以照此情况而觀、可推測而言者、如無其他力量出而阻撓、而僅任由意阿雙方對戰者、則意軍之佔領阿京阿迭斯阿貝巴、或亦為短期間所可能之事、惟日內瓦方面、（就事實言之、目前國聯倘為英國所左右、卽係英國方面、）是否能任由意大利國軍長此猛進、則尙在不可知之數、今農記者出外擬購閱英京泰晤士報及每日郵報等、自威尼司廣場搜尋至意外交部前克弄奈廣場及火車站等、遍索不得、詢之販報者、有云今日未到、有云業經售罄、其後過一英友處、始知自國聯行政院八日决斷意大利破壞盟約後、英報興論、或為意人所重視、或非意人所願公諸羣衆也、昨今兩日、國聯大會已開始討論對意經濟制裁問題、倘此議果能施行、以缺乏原料及財政狀况欠佳之現狀而言、意大利實將感受極大之痛苦、惟無論外交情勢加何發展、墨索里尼矢志前進、可斷言也、（十月十日晚發）</p>

<p>銀錢兩業信用長期放欵、十月底期已屆、為扶助工商業計、對到期長期放欵、特別通融、結息展至四月底惟兩業收解特別繁忙、昨日錢業市塲之洋拆、上下午兩市均為一角七分、較前日漲高二分、惟　頭加水、昨突漲至最高峰七角較前日漲高五角之鉅、為四月底以來所未有、此因錢莊解銀行欵驟增、致供求不能平衡之故、</p>
<p>結息展期完全辦妥　滬銀行錢莊暨甬漢錢莊在滬長期信用放欵、均於今日到期、雖早經承借之工商業、分別與銀錢兩業接洽結息、展期至四月底、同時兩業為扶助工商業計、特別通融、大都展期手續已辦妥、但昨日續有數起辦竣、至於新做長期放欵、則較去年大减、但至昨晚止已完全辦竣、</p>
<p>各業昨已安穩渡過　十月底之難關、雖不及總結帳時、但與四月底相同、各錢莊幸經財政部救濟後、復經銀錢兩業之通力合作、故未有不幸事件發生、至於工商各業信用長期、幸經銀錢業通融展期、及工商貨欵委員會之貨欵救濟、故各大工廠商號公司、昨日未聞有因週轉不靈而被迫停業者、至於如廣東路之永大鞋莊等之停業、則與十底實無關係、</p>

<p>注音漢字選字工作　二十四年三月、注音漢字銅模旣由部委托商請、面指令前國語會迅將此項漢字選定、關於此項漢字之數量問題、各方意見、約有三種、（一）主張即以注音漢字為限制用字數目之方法、釐訂基本漢字、以一千一百字左右為度、（二）主張客觀的事實上所需要之字數為範圍、兒童民衆所常用者、約三叫千字、先鑄合計普通用者至多亦不過六七千字、以次增鑄、（三）主張凡漢字皆須注音、愈不常用者愈宜確定讀音而注之、以後校印舊籍皆宜用注音漢字、使人人能誦讀、國語會因設特組會議、議决採用第二種意見、定為選字方針、準此方針、於是用最經濟方法從事選字、先將合此方針之各種字彙、逐字寫片、照國音常用字彙之順序而整理排列之、此項選字工作、從三月起至六月底始完成、是六千七百八十八字、即注音漢字字模之總字數也、</p>
<p>專授注音符號之課本、以備小學補習及短期義敎並民敎初步學習之用、但亦不可呆習字母、必須拼成簡單而有意義之詞句、因注音漢字能促進兒童民衆閱贖習作之能力、較簡體字僅便利書寫者效力更大、故宜注意作相當之凖備、九月三日、敎部遂制定推行辦法九條、以利推行、此即經過情形也、</p>

<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>大家曉得，目前我們要挽救中國民族經濟於危亡，把許多掙扎在破產與死亡綫上的人們，登到安居樂業的境域去，是只有從發展國產，振興工業的路上走，這是　一的正確的動向，可是，這幾年來，國貨的進行，不可謂不力，而國貨的前途，無疑義地還依然轉輾在很艱危的道上，客觀環境的阻撓，障碍重重，這是什麽原因呢？在這裏，我希望大家千萬勿委之於命運的說法，而要知道，國貨的成功，决不是一朝一夕的事，它却正需要我們更大的勇氣，去努力，去奮鬥，從黯澹的途中，去打開一條新生路。</p>
<p>橫在現階段國貨事業面前的幾個問題，我們是可以望到的，像銷貨狹窄，生產過第剩，經濟週轉率的呆滯，向外擴展市塲的在在受阻等，這都是莫大的缺憾，而在另一方面，我們却正可看到那些在華所設的外廠，他們除了資本的雄厚，設備的宏大外，對於出品的認眞，銷售方法的講究，運輸方法的便利，更在在使我們感到望塵莫及，所以我深深地覺得，在現下國貨前途的進行上，除了努力向外發展外，似乎還有對於工業組織，經營方法，生產技術加以注意的必要，現在我就寫出關於上述的幾點，希望全體工業界急速的注意和實施：</p>
<p>第一，改進生產技術，在近年來國貨因受社會人士的勗促，使出品日趨精美的果很多，但是，因於同業的競爭，而不得不以偸工减料相接濟者，也在所不免，從今起我們應堅决擺脫這種飲酖止渴的行為，應努力改進生產技術，一方面求成本的减輕，以低廉售價，一方面適應顧客的需要，力求出品精美。</p>
<p>第二，努力金融合作，市面不景氣的潮流，使金融界對工業放欵，日益緊縮，値此危機，國貨界實應與金融界澈底合作，以打開出路，而目下應首先實行的，像（一）以商業承兌匯票的貼現，代替現下的信用放欵，（二）以銀行承兌匯票，代替現下的動產押欵，（三）以承受公司憤票方式，代替現下的廠基押欵。</p>
<p>第三，提倡國產原料，從事國貨工業的廠商，對於原料，應極力採用國產，同時，要將國產未有的原料，設法開闢，提倡，使一方面杜絕龐大的漏巵，一方面增進農村收入，也就是促進一般農民的國貨購買力。</p>
<p>第四，研究運輸便利，今後國貨的出路，無疑義地必在邊陲省區與海外市塲的開始，而對於運輸方法的研究，實很重要，我們將如何使運費低廉，而中途貨品不受損失，時間迅速等先决條件，要加以研討和施行。</p>
<p>本來，發展國貨的途徑，是多方面的，而樹立國貨的信譽，實在尤其是首要之圖，我們一定要獲得全國民衆一致對國貨的信心，為民族工業前途造成一個最堅强的基礎。</p>

<p>最近願炳元君，自歐美考察工廠歸國，記者詢以參觀十五國工業的感想何若？顧君謂各國努力生產，擴展國外市塲，可謂不遺餘力，如德，如英，如瑞典，如奧匈，如美，如日本，尤注意製造之精進，而以减低成本低廉售價為惟一目標。低廉售價，方法茶多，但一致注意技術人才之訓練，向科學管理一途努力，為一致之傾向。尤其可以贊美的。為捷克斯拉夫的之工業，其拔佳鞋廠之經營，宛如一工業集團區域，全廠自成一區，工人不下三萬人，工人住宅以及消費物品，公用事業，公共娛樂，均由公家經營，為大量之採購，作零星之分銷，以故工人生活程度較諸工業區域以外，特為减低，同一工人，在拔佳廠工作，得每月五十元之工資，在外非七十元八十元不可，故工人都願在廠工作，無形之中，大可减低許多成本，此拔佳鞋子，所以無敵於世界。至如科學管理，雖重在機械之準確，與人才之訓練，時間經濟之認眞，但辦事之不苟，不敷衍，不延擱，尤可為我國貨界所取則。各國事業界，上自政府，以迄各工廠商店經理職員，一致於計算之精密，時間之遵守，辦事之頂眞與迅速，尤堪敬佩，如意大利德意志，自墨索利尼希特勒秉政以來，工作之緊張，任何地方可以見到。卽如不壓擱文件一端，尤有一趣事可述：卽辦公桌子，主張不用抽屜，以為有抽屜以後，往往將應辦事伴擲置其中，以為今日不及，尙可待諸明日，及愈積愈多，則處理棘手，視為困難，而一切事業，永無迅速之望，故僉認為抽屜為辦事上之礁石，不如直捷了當，廢置為宜。此雖小節，在科學管理上大有採用或研究之價値。並為介紹，以吿我國貨界同志。</p>
<h3 id="c178">這一月來的國貨運動 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>這一月來的國貨運動，我覺得有幾件事情，是有提出來說一說的必要，現在逐一的寫在下面，幷酌加我個人的管見，以蹬咱們中國的國貨前途，並不是沒有希望的，只要有人肯苦幹實幹和在上者肯切切實實的提倡的話。</p>
<p>（一）社會局規定嚴密國貨商塲組織；—年來國貨商塲之風起雲湧，可謂風極一時，這在提倡國貨立塲而論，好像是一個很好的現象，然而，我們根據報紙的記載，覺得國貨商塲因組織不健全而發生糾紛的，已有南通無錫等多處，這是一件得可痛心的事，於國貨推銷前途，大有妨碍，現在社會局有鑒於此，特嚴密規定國貨商塲組織規程，設想週到，殊能防止今後國貨商塲糾紛之發生，而增加一般人對於國貨，商塲良好的印象，這也是一件殊足欣慰的事。</p>
<p>（二）粤敎育廳取締學生裝飾；粤省敎育廳對於全省學子之裝飾，定有規例三條，訓令一致遵守，（一）學生須衣國貨材料製成之服裝，（二）女生不得燙髮，（三）禁塗脂粉及着高跟鞋等等，當此學生國貨年形將結束之際，粤省敎育當局能注意於此，我們實在不能以暮鼓晨鐘視之，很希望其他各省敎育當局，也一致進行，替學生國貨年，收一最後之宏效。</p>
<p>（三）梁桐芳等組織勸用國貨促進團：—愛國志士梁桐芳等，為促進國貨推銷起見，特聯合同志多人，組織一勸用促進國貨團，一方面向各工廠各國貨團體徵求國貨品，同時並聘請國貨界先進林康侯王曉籟潘仰堯，方液仙諸先生為顧問，相機指導，這是很値得一般愛用國貨的靑年們來效法提倡的。</p>
<p>（四）總工會組織國貨推銷團：—上海市總工會為救濟失業工人起見，特向各廠接洽，組織一國貨推銷團，一以救濟工人之失業，一以設法國貨之推銷，一舉兩得，誠佳事也。</p>
<p>（五）社會局取締國貨用洋名：國貨採用洋文，實在是一件非常常羞恥之事，現社會局正在派員密查，遇有國貨之採用洋名者，將予以取締，這是對於提倡國貨的心理建設方面，有很大的關係的。</p>
<p>如上所述，我覺得在最近一月來的國貨運動，顯然已有非常的進展，爰不憚麻煩，表而出之，我一般關心國貨運動者一吿焉。</p>
<h3 id="c179">國貨絨綫 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>天氣漸漸的冷起來，那絨綫的銷售，又要突飛猛進了。不要以為這是一件小東西，人們的需要，他却比棉花皮貨還廣大。因為他合乎一切人的胃口，窮人富人都歡喜；而所編造成的東西，男女老小都合用，像衫褲帽襪手套圍巾，以及女人的大衣等，你想一年要需用他多少！</p>
<p>絨綫的所以使人喜用，第一是堅牢耐穿，所以經濟的主婦，沒有個不喜歡他的你想替小孩子做一身棉襖褲，價錢雖便宜，可是小孩子蹤蹤跳跳，至多一二年便要損壞；一套絨綫襖褲，任你怎樣的會穿，至少有五年的時間，這樣一算，絨綫豈不是比棉布便宜嗎！而且絨綫富彈縮性，做得小一些，穿了也不妨；做得大一些，上身也無礙，不像棉布般小了不能穿；大了便不暖。因了這一點，又增加了人們的歡迎。</p>
<p>第二點的優點，便是輕鬆柔軟。一件棉襖做得太厚了，重量吃不消；做得太薄，全無暖氣；而且穿了一二年，棉花壓得像板一般的硬，穿着又冷又不舒服。絨綫却全無此弊，這又是引人歡迎的一大原因。</p>
<p>絨綫在家庭裏旣有這般的需要，可惜市塲上都充滿了外國貨，這眞是一個大大的漏巵。幸虧在前年起，我們的國貨也出現了，最早的要算天津製的抵羊牌絨綫，為了國貨的緣故，倒也風行一時。今年又有雙手牌絨綫等的發行，這不是國貨界的一個好現象嗎！</p>
<p>絨綫的製成，我們差不多都知道是用製煉的羊毛和植物的纖維。要是羊毛多，纖維少，那末製成的東西，柔軟堅牢，合乎優良的標準；反之便粗硬脫毛，不受人歡迎。外貨中的蜜蜂老牌，便是合乎這優美標準的，所以人人樂用，到今還是勢不可侮咧！國產的絨綫，價錢當然是便宜的了；不過還要於柔軟堅牢方面，加以注意，那末才不致於給外貨打倒咧！</p>
<h3 id="c180">稻草製漿之漂白法（十） <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>稻草製紙，本為中國古法，其漂白工程，完全利用日曝，稱為「本晒」，並不需用任何藥品，今用亞硫酸施行漂白，則稱「半晒」，其顏色如欲純白，則須反復數回，但易耗損消失，殊不合算，製造報紙，只此已足，否則當以半晒品煮沸後，曝於曠野中日光多處，使其飽受日光久露之後，則其色亦轉白，比之本晒可省一半工夫，故稱「半晒」，惟在製成半晒品之漂白工程，有當注意之點，試再申詳言之。</p>
<p>凡用石灰製成之草漿，須先浸於一度之鹽酸中，使石灰溶解而成可溶性之鹽化鈣，乃得冲洗而去，否則石灰包蔽於外，大費漂料，卽不合算，凡用亞硫酸鈉漂者，當先化成千分之五之溶液，乃以經過鹽酸之草漿，浸入其中，約三四小時取出，再浸於一度之鹽酸液中，當此之際，所用兩種溶液，上述之量，不過指其極度，實際上均係加入於打漿機內，其中本有多量之水，且必不能精確定其重量，故以炊飲為喻，全在操作者之經騐，始能以大量觀察，用適其當，此與醫生處方給藥相同，决不能照醫書抄示一方，而醫生之高明與否，亦卽在此，但如所用藥品超過極量時，縱其成效立見，但於體質上必多損失，若不足時，則其效力太薄，卽非一劑所能奏功，而於所用之藥品，所含有效成分如何，亦頗有關，卽在加熱與叩解時間之久暫，亦與成品之折耗大有逕庭，故在初試時，往往有用百斤之漿，而成品不過一半，或竟少至三分之一，是則又與燒菜煮肉無異，過熟必腐，化而為糜，雖使完全消失，亦屬可能，無足異也。</p>
<p>上法均為報紙用途，取其廉　而言，如造細紙，欲其永久白而不變，則當用「次亞鹽酸鈉」漂，為最合算，其方程式為Nacioh，卽用食鹽施行電解，放去一份之輕，成為「鈉綠養輕」，卽俗稱為漂白水者是，其效用等於「過養化輕，」故能永不變色，而成本亦廉。</p>
<p>與金竺二君晤談，不過十數分鐘，雖由金君依余口述筆記而去，但於漂白工程。所當注意之點，則未覼縷詳盡，故復詳述如上，民豐設有二廠，一在嘉興，一在杭州，近以黃紙板已經供過於求，方致力於白紙板之進行，原用白料，成本頗昂，如果能用草漿漂白，則除自用外，大可擴而充之，以供別廠之用，凡有平簾機者，無不可造報紙，向以原料問題不能解决，購用木漿，其價實與布漿相等，不但無利可圖，且須貼本，自造草漿，則以工作繁忙，無暇試騐，而且試騐决非一次所能成功滿意，故不敢於輕嘗淺試，利用廠以不惜犧牲，雖已試騐成功，但係圓簾機，只能造單面光紙，烘筒僅七十二寸，故不合算，而蒸球亦祇一座，正如小鍋煮飯，决不能辦大餐，民豐果能採用草漿，則繼起者必不乏人，農村副產之物，正不止一稻草，因而得以儘量變錢，別釆樵薪，以供炊用，一年之後，相率成風，是則遍地金錢，悉產生於農村之內，轉窮為富，正不必期待十年樹木百年樹人也，吾於民豐，實企望之。</p>
<h3 id="c181">談名譽學位與國貨發明家 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 陳遵源</p>
<p>去月復旦大學舉行三十週紀念的盛會，同時，並以名譽博士授贈孫科氏等六人，贈給名譽碩士，名譽學士的總計也有十數人，確是一件使人注目的大事，但是這些名譽學位究竟該大學是否有權贈予，抑或應該由國家贈予，在這裏，我不願意有所討論，我現在所要談的是名譽學位應該贈給那些人，換句說話，就是什麼人才能够獲名譽學位的資格。</p>
<p>名譽學位在中國的歷史，原不自今日開始，回憶民國初年，徐世昌任北京政府總統時候，法國巴黎大學，已贈給他文學博士的學位，數年前，伶界聞人梅蘭芳　遊新大陸，美國坡馬那大學也以文學博士學位贈給他，這都是外國人贈給中國人名譽學位的先例，說到中國自己，也曾有上海的約翰大學以名譽學位贈給國內有聲譽的人，其實，他們，這些受得名譽學位的人，不是政界要人，便是社會上的聞人，像徐氏孫氏位尊為總統院長，他們的聲名，早就揚播全國，為什麼要勞那些大學的駕來送給他們這些學位，如果以為他們在政治上社會上有功勳，那就該由政府另以勳章等級，授予他們，做相當的獎勵，何必要把這些專任獎勵那些文化學術有特殊貢獻的學位濫送給他們，這未免污損學位的價値，何况今日中國所應當獎勵的並不是那班高貴院長部長的政治主張，也不是那班聲名鼎鼎的社會聞人，中國今日所需要的却是從事物質建設而孜孜不倦的科學人村，所以國家對於物質生產的發明家，尤其是國貨發明家，自然要用全副精力去鼓勵，可是在事實上却未曾聽過有一位國貨發明家獲得名譽學位。</p>
<p>也許有人要懷疑，為什麼國貨發明家値得這麽獎勵呢？</p>
<p>這是很容易回答的，國貨發明家大都能在工藝上或機械上有特殊的發見，這可說在生產學術文化上已有了相當的貢獻了這不去鼓勵要鼓勵誰呢？另一方面他們所發明的物質，對於國家的利益，固然很多，最顯著的可以抵抗舶來品，减少入超，杜絕扈漏，增加國家的富源，在國民經濟上又有莫大的貢獻，稍微懂得經濟原理的人都會知道，其次對於農村的救濟，在目前，也正是對症的妙藥，準此，我以為名譽學位應該完全用在獎勵有關於國家生產的發明家，這就是說惟有國貨發明家才够有受名譽學位的資格，這樣一來，名譽學位旣有相當的規定，受者的資格也有嚴格的限制，那末，名譽學位的尊嚴性與可貴性就不至於喪失了。</p>

<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>在這世界恐慌與不景氣的年頭兒！我國的民族地位和工商業，却已進了病入膏肓時期了！對於工商業的憔悴！各方雖紛投藥石，力謀挽救！可是還無濟於事，淸理，倒閉，日有所聞，比較切實救急之策，還是上海工商復興委員會所通過的「籌碼問題意見」書裏所說：以公司債替代不動產抵押借欵，以商業承兌匯票，替代工廠營運借欵，這是很好的辨法，但除商業承兌票據已試行見效外，公司債的發行和是否銷售得開，還離事實甚遠！卽使證券交易所允予拍板，然而工商業沒落得如此悲慘！是否有人承買，實為一絕大疑問！荏苒光陰，已屆十底，金融界對放於工商業的長期放欵，均須歸償！惟市面枯竭至斯，設無轉圜補救，恐將同歸於盡！國貨工廠聯合會呈部令銀錢兩業，結淸利息，通融轉期，是萬不得已的事，銀錢兩業能顧全大局，通融扶助，這已顯示金融界和工商業切實團結，站在一條戰綫上，謀自力更生了！患難相助，而後安樂與共！，不可不謂好現象也！</p>
<p>雖然：筆者極望國貨工廠和商號經理，不可以為金融界的通融十底難關，而忘却埋頭苦幹！和業務上的進展，曁緊縮開支，活潑經濟的計劃，而自掘墳墓！應該加倍努力！這是筆者所竭虔誠禱的。</p>

<p>公振老友，別三稔矣，落月停雲，云何弗念。有時新雁過小樓，將得尺一書來，開緘雜誦，情見乎辭，而蠅頭之字，羅羅淸疎，如見故人顏色；顧以萬里睽隔，積愫難傾，惟遙祝其為國珍重而已。去冬周子劍雲伉儷與胡蝶女士有蘇俄之行，愚嘗以寸箋相託，一訴衷腸，旋得其復書，媵以俄文豪高爾基氏彩色小像一幀，書云：</p>

<p>近歲舞塲歌榭，蕃樂盛興，資以悅耳快心者，匪此莫屬，至若琴學一道，幾成絕調，所謂高人逸士，引商刻羽，亦不過為詩歌詞曲上名詞點綴耳。今秋重九，澄江莊劍丞君，雅人深致，逸興遄飛，柬邀閩·湘·皖·鄂·蜀·越諸省旅蘇琴友，會於顧氏怡園。是晨飲馬護龍之道，路行者輒見挾琴而過，不知其事者指為日人假某園舉行琴會也。（琴與奕，皆吾國固有之藝術，今奕之一席，已讓日人居上，而琴之一藝，亦將畀日人兼而有之邪？此小事也，足覘國人之心理。）會中操琴者，為李子昭·吳蘭蓀·郭同甫·彭祉卿·査阜西·吳湘泉·吳湘岑·吳湘珩·莊劍丞九人。李年七十九，最長，湘岑·湘珩兩女士，最幼，年均不逾二十也。査阜西先生為莊君之師，査對人云：劍丞為吾入室弟子。劍丞語余云：渠師於琴，不以操縵為盡事，其審別律呂細微處，多發前人所未發。且謂律呂成法也，音韻天籟也，今之操縵者，輒以天籟之音節，囿於成法之律呂，是能擅琴工之未藝，不足以語琴學之至道也。査所操瀟湘水雲一曲，凡十八節，宋郭楚望所作，律之隸於無射均者也。前三節和而緩，使　者耳目之下，如見雲山靉靆，烟樹迷濛之態。四節以下舒而展，引人心神交會，如遍舟一葉，往選雲水之中。最妙者，操至尾聲，而環聽者之踞案憑機倚柱如故也。此蓋　乎內而靜乎外者　？劍丞操長門怨，於怨字曲曲傳出，不敢謂為出藍，以視向者之　於琴工，判若霄壤矣。餘如李翁以下所奏，無不圓妙。與會者凡三十餘人，査君為同會攝景而散。園主彥平先生云：民九秋，杭人葉璋伯先生亦假是地作會琴盛舉，到會者亦數十人，操奏者有方外二人，而無閨秀，是今日之會，謂為勝於昔日之會，亦無不可。</p>

<p>— 心意</p>
<p>我生平不願捧人，尤怕講肉麻話，所以寫本篇，决不是捧馮風，而是記馮鳳，這裏，先得聲明一下。</p>
<p>提起「馮鳳」兩字，大槪一般愛看歌舞的朋友，都有些面熱，都知道伊是擅演風騷戲，在台上有一種說不出的熱力，把觀衆的內心會强烈地燃燒起來，大凡看過伊的朋友，都嘗着過那種說不出的味兒了，因此，在一般人的理想中，伊一定是位浪漫得可以的都市小姐；否則，在台上怎麼能够那樣地入木三分呢。</p>
<p>但是，出人意料之外的事，也未嘗沒有，當伊離開舞台以後，你决不相信伊是舞台上的「馮鳳」，一定說伊是個鄉下大姑娘；本來，一套藍布短褂褲，一雙布底十鞋，回到家裏，就做女紅，淘米洗菜，掃地抹桌，樣樣都來，見了生人，還要臉紅，那裏像一個時髦的歌舞明星。</p>
<p>伊的家境很淸寒，爸爸媽媽之外，還有一個幼年的弟弟，都需要伊兩條腿跳出來的錢去養活，所以，伊在團裏，雖是薪工最優的一個，但伊從不敢浪用分文，十分刻苦着自己，出外從不雇車，肚子餓了，連點心也不捨得買一點吃吃，每月領到了包銀，必全數交給伊的媽媽，自己身邊只留兩隻八開而已。</p>
<p>最後，我應該介紹，伊是銀月團的台柱子，今年芳齡才十六歲，天生着一副討人歡喜的臉蛋，很適當地配在一副健美的合時代的體格上，而且伊對於歌唱舞蹈都有了很深刻的基本，現在，還孜孜不倦地前進着，和時下一班只會賣弄風騷毫無眞才實藝的所謂明星者不可同日而語了，因為我覺得無論戲劇，電影，歌舞，伊都是一個很有希望的人才，所以樂於記述如上。</p>

<p>「你不要笑我們沒膽量！這朶花的確開得帶些妖氣，說不定就有什麼禍患要臨到我們身上，或我們的國家的頭上來了！」伊用着一種耳語似的聲音，向我說着；態度是依舊非常鄭重，兩道眉毛差不多要打成一個結子了。</p>
<p>我那時聽伊那麼的輕輕地說着，不覺也逐漸相信起來了。我自己原是絕對不信什麼吉兆凶兆的，伊的話也並不能改變我的信仰，祗因我追隨伊老人家已有了這麼許多的日子，早就深深地體騐到伊所擁着的權勢是如何的偉大了；伊旣已擁着這樣大的權勢，又復如此深切的迷信着吉兆和凶兆，那末為了那一朵玉蘭花而使伊自己去製造出一個禍患來，豈是不可能的事？所以太后是因迷信預兆而憂慮有禍患臨頭，我乃是因迷信伊老人家的權勢而惟恐眞有什麼禍患；雖然同樣是憂慮，但心理是各別的。（四四九）</p>

<h3 id="c188">羅克的私生活 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 靑</p>
<p>美國滑稽明星羅克氏，自從一不怕死」一片，給與了我們一個較壞的印象以後，他的作品久已不到中國來了。也許這幾年他正在作充分的休息，沒有什麼新作品吧？可是羅克以往的成績，在我們仍然是忘不了的，如今我且來談談他的私生活，以作茶餘酒後的談助。</p>
<p>羅克的眞名叫做哈洛爾勞愛，他是一個樸實而謙和的人。他的夫人梅德麗但維絲，是他以前許多影片中的女主角。結婚以來，已有好多年，還是相愛如初，並且已有了很可愛的結晶品了。他在影片中，雖是架着一副黑邊的眼鏡，而一走出攝影場，却就把眼鏡除下，他平日是向來不架眼鏡的。他生平喜歡工作，愛名譽也愛金錢，但他尤其愛他的家庭，他除了工作以外，簡直把全副精神，全都放在他的夫人和子女們的身上了。</p>
<p>他曾主演過三百五十部影片，掙得了不少的錢，要算是好蘭塢最富的明星了。然而他很知節省，並且很聰明的投資於各種企業中，從未失敗。他先前本是很窮苦的，知道金錢的來處不易，所以從來不肯浪費。他那最大的奢侈，便是他的住宅，有一座二十畝的花園，並有一個游泳池和高爾夫球塲，那屋子又大又華麗，裝飾得盡盡美，眞好像是一所神話中的皇宮一樣。只為　子和園子很大，不得不多用幾個下人，因此他有十八名園丁，一名汽卓夫，十多名男女僕役。瞧他有這許多下人，以為他是很奢侈的了。那知伸實在是非常的精明，每天肉店中送來的肉類，要是短少了一些，他就得提出抗議。他的一家中要吃多少鷄蛋，他也知道得明明白白。所有各項賬單，有一位秘書給他管理，而每月由他自己親目查看，倘有不符之處，他一定要詳細的盤問；每個月他將賬欵付淸，决不積壓，無論是一便士二便士的賬，也須登記起來；要是食物和其他日用品的價格有了變動，而和賬目相差時，他一定要知道內中的理由，羅克自己規定每星期一百金元的零用，從不超過此數，就是對於夫人和子女們的費用，也各有規定的。</p>
<p>羅克很喜歡安靜的生活，從不舉行盛大的宴會，就是好蘭塢奢華的交際塲中，也沒有他的踪跡，但是賭博，賽船，以及馬球等等，他也從不參加的。他的夫人，也和他一樣的質樸，不事修飾，好蘭塢的時髦女明角伊並不來往，只是悄悄地過伊安樂的家庭生活。羅克一家都很愛花，但是他們也不肯多花錢，所用的花都是自己園子裏種出來的，有時向化店中躉買一批，也很便宜。他們倘若招待親友時，只是吃一頓很簡單的飯，談一回天，或是來一塲不作輸贏葉紙戲，那就把一個黃昏消磨去了。羅克夫婦常玩網球和高爾夫球，作為日常的運動。每逢夏季，羅克夫人和子女們，往往穿着浴衣，在游泳池中作游泳之戲。</p>
<p>他們的子女，兒子叫做小哈洛爾，女兒名喚格羅麗，更有一個義女名喚潘琪，都是品行很好，而性情馴良的兒童。羅克夫人常予以嚴格家庭針育，不肯放鬆，每月零用也各有規定的數目，他們倘要購買新的玩具，而本月份的錢早已用完，那麼只得等到下個月再買，一些兒不能通融的。兩個女兒雖在幼年，羅克夫人已敎伊們縫紉和烹飪，並且鋪伊們的床舖，要使伊們將來做有用的國民。伊們平常都以「梅德」一字喚伊們的母親，與人家喚「媽媽」的不同。可是梅德如今也和以前在伊丈夫的影片中充女主角時，完全不同了。伊的金髮和藍眼，雖是沒有變動，但已　成了一個老練而有思慮的婦人，伊的心中只為丈夫和子女們着想，溫柔體貼，眞的是無微不至，伊在好蘭塢眞不愧是一位標準的賢妻良母哩。</p>

<h3 id="c207">論喜劇的本質與「巡按」 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 旅岡</p>
<p>一般人大抵容易對於喜劇（Conedy）發生着干誤解，以為喜劇只是令人發笑的東西，其　喜劇的本質並不如是單純，如果喜劇的涵義眞的僅是在於令人笑謔，而「遠離了現實，失去了活生生的內容」，那末，一這種，戲劇，是把根本的意義完全喪盡的了！簡直已成了一種遊戲的了！」（貝列維爾則夫）所以，果戈理才熱烈地說：「演劇竟是製造哄孩子的玩物呵！」</p>
<p>當十九世紀的歐洲舞臺，幾乎完全給非現實的Melodrama和Vaudeville佔據了的時候，果戈理曾經大聲地抗議說：「Melodrama和Vaudeville已經掌握了全世界的戲劇五年了！這是怎樣的醜態呵！……倘若有一位天才的威風能把這種瘴氣掃淸，那麽全世界定會拿他和拜倫並立呵。這不是滑稽的說法，因為在這種努力中是涵有相當的安慰的。大仲馬以及其他的巨匠們已成了全世界的立法者了，我敢誓言，這實在是十九世紀這五年的恥辱呵！唩，莫理哀，偉大的莫理哀呵，將一切性格，以至性格之影而使它廣大地發展起來的就是你呵！你那嚴格的，用心深刻的拉辛，你又是那在詩的世界中把人類的價値照着出來的，懷有高尙熱情的席拉。請看看在你以後的我們的舞臺上正流行着一些什麽吓？看吧，那是多麼令人恐怖的怪物—Melodrama—的醜態在我們之間遊蕩着呵！到底我們是生活在什麽地方呢？懷有一切現代煩惱的，和茫然不可測的我們是在何處呢？我們從Melodrama中那怕能找出一點點自己的反映也好，但是我們的Melodrama是頂沒有良心的，除去撒謊就沒有別的了。……</p>
<p>這時代中的Melodrama和Vaudeville完令是恐怖，荒唐無稽的戲劇，在說白中涵有所謂諷刺，它與活生生的現實絲毫也沒有關聯，這種戲劇，把作為「市民針育與道德敎育之敎壇一的劇塲，「降為無益的娛樂塲所」了！所以果戈理「痛切地攻擊劇作家將　現實生活毫無聯繫的作品塞進上演目錄中去。」果戈理認為，使戲劇的本質上受傷害最大的危險物，是在於喜劇的人物之被錯誤認識，也就是把劇中人物誤作逗人發笑的娛樂品的認識。果戈理說：「笑甚比人們所想像的更重要更深刻的。那絕不是因受一時的刺戟；而從不健康的氣質中生出來的為消遺而供給的笑，却是從人們坦白的本性中飛迸出來的笑。……倘若有人做了些卑賤的，無聊的事情，在他向前表現出可怕的，諷刺的力量，而他却裝模作樣的喊出：『那會有這種人哪！」這可見他的認識比別人更苛酷了。」這種健康的笑，正蘊藏在果戈理的作品中，從「巡按」，「外套一，「死靈魂」，……等的小說和戲劇里，他使人在現實社會中找到一些眞實的典型人物，這些人物，在他底筆下成為大家所深刻認識的，熟知的，也許就是生長在自己的周圍的，官僚，土豪，地主，村長。……</p>
<p>貝列維爾則夫說：一喜　絕對不是滑稽的，它和悲劇是同類的東西。在本質上，喜劇和悲劇僅僅有一步的差別。在喜劇的笑的深處，同樣藏着構成悲劇之力的那個隱秘的淚。這種笑，是從一切頹廢的，卑賤的，而將人類破滅的事物之尖銳的洞察中生出來的。因為放蕩的人的滑稽是終於要陷於毀滅和　鬱的。對於人，這種　越的憂鬱如果不個存在，那末喜劇也不會有在的了。那種下流的調侃，那種失掉眞正內容的笑，以及小丑的胡調，都全不是喜劇。眞的喜劇是和悲劇涵有同樣高尙意義的，並且在演劇的地位上也佔有同等的地位與價値。喜劇　不是　蠢笨的事去取悅觀衆的丑戲，它和悲劇一樣，同是人類本性中的神秘的姿容，同是人類的呼喊。」這一段話，把喜劇的本質作了一個簡明和扼要的解說。而果戈理和他的戲劇，也就是從這一種隱秘的淚」中滲透出來的。他的一巡按一揭露了一般官僚的昏庸，阿諛，貝列維爾則夫說：「這個喜劇含有對於現實社會非常深邃的觀察，和令人從內心發迸出來的笑。」而且，「由於這兩種力量，所以能給人以空前的深刻的印象。為了如此，果戈理的「巡按」之出現才受了當時保守社會的嚴厲的攻擊。司是這此攻擊，依舊不能毀滅了果戈理底現實主義的諷刺作品在俄國文學中起了極大的作用，在十九世紀的尼古拉皇朝中留下宏偉的影響，使現實主義在俄羅斯奠下了鞏固的基石。</p>
<p>「巡按」的出現使人認識了果戈理對於戲劇的偉大的天才，他和莫理哀差不多同樣地「以充滿了粗暴的，健康的愉快的歡笑」來「開始自一己的喜劇作家的活動。」莫理哀「以社會心理的喜劇來克服笑劇及滑稽劇，由此他造出了照應於自己的階級的喜劇典型，因之也造出了能為其他國家的市民喜劇的標本的喜劇典型」（傅里米）。果戈理對於莫理哀發生了很大的愛好，然而他的「巡按却是普式庚的誘掖之下去完成的。但是，他倒並不至於如外間所誤傳的那樣，說「這個故事是普希金吿訴他的」（李則綱：「歐洲沂代文藝」買二〇五）。因為從果戈理底尖刻的觀察里，他之忠於客觀的寫實主義的暴露是毫不為奇的。關於果戈理的作品，誠如普式庚所說。「果戈理並沒啊揑造什麽，這是單純的眞實，可怕的眞實！」這「可怕的眞實，」甚至於還是「超於普式庚之上的」（白朗斯基。）</p>
<p>由於「巡接」在舞台上底初次的演出之不滿，使果戈理與劇塲之間起了本質的鬥爭。果戈理說：『巡按」的上演，竟被他們演成一件粗野的東西，簡直不像我的作品了。主角是完全失敗。狄爾）演主角的演員）對於赫列斯達珂夫（「巡按」中的主角）是怎樣的一個人，他連一根毛也不理解。他竟把赫列斯達珂夫演成一個好像從巴黎劇塲出身的小丑或個流氓，穿着二世紀的衣裳，打着花臉。」……這次鬥爭的結果，是果戈理獲得了勝利，於是：「為了要對觀衆能把那個劇本的豐富內容儘量展開，立刻就感到劇塲和俳優須有新的特殊態度之必要」。因　從習慣了的Vaudeville風的演員是不會理解喜劇的本質的。……這以後，果戈理使俄國劇壇發生了一次質的變動。</p>
<p>那管果戈理的晚年在演劇的議論中包涵了多少宗敎神秘論的意味，然而他的「巡按」之成為十九世紀俄國戲劇底最光輝的劇本，是無可誹議的。白朗斯基說：「自從果戈理的戲　出現之後，那就讀不到更好的劇本，也看不到更好的演劇」。這並不是過份的話。</p>
<h3 id="c208">金綫泉邊 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 張春橋</p>
<p>在濟南住了四五年的光景，差不多完是窮和忙。為了窮，要忙；忙的結果依然是窮。秋天了，人們都吵著去龍洞看紅葉，自己也很願意去玩一玩，雖是俗人，娛樂是誰也需要的。但是，跑着去，不成；路太遠，坐車去；沒車錢，結果和朋友往金綫泉去。</p>
<p>金綫泉，在趵　泉東邊有一座大門，題着「尙書堂」的扁額，進去這大門便可以找得到。大門里是一個小院，進一，門是操塲，風車的格龍格龍的聲音，節奏的響着，時常　噪雜的昨呼聲掩沒了。在院子的西邊，有一個園鬥。</p>
<p>我們三個人，進了園鬥，秋大的凉風搖落了葉子，搖着我們的衣袖。的確是荒蕪了。沒有了昔日的丰度，那淸新的丰度。</p>
<p>了並不很人，在院子中間，有一座水亭。四周繞着透清的水。這些水，都是從院子的西北角里流來的，那源泉便是金綫泉。從　綫泉流出來的水，和對面漱玉池的緩流，混　着向墻外流去。</p>
<p>我們三個人，就坐在假山的山块上。</p>
<p>高大的樹木，枝葉錯綜地交織在天上，看不到北國的高高的天野。記得在夏天的時候，葉子更是濃密。春中，花香與鳥語，更給春天的人們以陶醉。現在，秋天了，「詩人」的季節來到了，有的往杭州觀潮，有的在欣賞紅葉，有的更在受苦，有的更偷閒。在院子的西南角的草亭上，兩個五六十歲的老人，正在下棋。我們，也正在有閑地休息。</p>
<p>注視者那池碧綠的池水，」詩人一　，在速記簿上題著詩句。我記不淸楚了，大概是描寫這一曲水的。他說，這水綠的像凝固住的葡萄汁，一定是甜蜜蜜的比冰糖還好吃。而水中的魚的翻身，他更認為是美麗的，美麗到還沒有合適的字來形容，另外的朋友風，正計劃一個畫面。我呢，有著說不出的味覺，在心頭潮水似地泛濫着。</p>
<p>在池子的岸邊，有兩株高大的芭蕉，肥滿的綠葉，還很生氣地長著。</p>
<p>我們接到金綫泉的那條金綫，誰也沒有看到過那條綫。也聽人說過，在早晨黃昏，是很容易見到的。我們三個　沒遇到這機會。接著又談到漱玉液。漱玉池平平凡凡的沒有什麽可看。但是，聽說，漱玉池是詞人李淸照的故居，她那名貴的漱玉詞便是在這里作的。</p>
<p>不知道多少人喜歡漱玉詞，但是漱玉池殘毀了，像他的主人一樣，只在歷史上留下一個名字而已。</p>
<p>—他媽媽的，咱也弄個什麼池，作部什麽詩集！</p>
<p>—他媽媽的，咱也弄個什麼池，作張什麽畫！</p>
<p>兩個人互相譏諷著，手里的鉛筆在小册子上作著黑的字，黑的條，嘴里嘟嘟嚕嚕地，好像不願意人家聽，又想叫人聽似的口頭，不時地動搖著測量角度，思索字句。我無聊地看著他倆說：</p>
<p>—散散吧，老鄉，在這地方寫出來的詩只能裝書架，在這地方盡出來的畫只能飾客廳，別的少說吧！</p>
<p>「詩人」瞪着我說：</p>
<p>—你休息吧，明天要工作了！</p>

<p>— 白塵</p>
<p>賣票的眼睛四面兜個囑子，盯着男的。「哈地方？」</p>
<p>男的拿出數好的銅板，『杜（大）馬路，兩張。」</p>
<p>女的看男的一眼，沒有響。</p>
<p>咕……。</p>
<p>「泥城橋……！」</p>
<p>擁上一陣人。中間有一位提小皮箱的朋友，衝到玻璃門那兒站定了。打開箱藍，拿出幾包擠。開口便嚷嚷：</p>
<p>『喂，諸位先生！阿要吃奶油巧克力糖？　個是上海大華　菓公同格出品。為係新開張推廣營業起見，特別大减價。貨色好，　鈿巧，眞　奶油巧克力，平常賣兩角杜洋（五）條，今天祇賣兩角小洋鈿。並且賣五條送一條。——兩角小洋買洋　六條……」</p>
<p>幾位掉過臉去看馬路。幾位看看這張活動的嘴。</p>
<p>提小皮箱的朋友對不理他的人一點也不難為情。還是說着：「諸位先生阿要試試看　此地帶得有樣品，……」伸手在箱子裏掏出許多小紙包。</p>
<p>女的看看男的，男的把嘴一披。「廣吿」！掉過臉去。</p>
<p>小紙包在對面分送，「諸位嚐嚐看，沒哈關係，樣品是　要銅鈿格。吃的好，就請照顧照顧。」</p>
<p>對面客人有的接了，有的搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「試試看，試試看，諸位先生！」說的聲音很客氣，面孔可像木頭刻的。</p>
<p>小紙包兒到這一邊來了。女的側眼看着。男的也　了一眼，半邊臉還朝着窗外。</p>
<p>「先生，試試看。……」</p>
<p>第一個搖搖頭。第一個便也搖了。第三個自然不好意思不搖。第四個—男的照樣學了，女的也連忙學着男的。</p>
<p>「沒啥關係，試試看，弗買弗要緊格。」</p>
<p>那傢伙眞厚臉，人家搖頭，他還給小紙包兒丟到人身上。——一人身上一包。</p>
<p>男的像生氣地橫那傢伙一眼。女的偷偷看眼男的。</p>
<p>男的眼睛看着窗外，左手輕輕地摸到小紙包兒，便夾在三個手指裏揑揑掂掂的，正眼也不瞧牠一下。女的學着男的，但放在手帕的摺縫裏。一</p>
<p>「哪位先生照顧？……」</p>
<p>那傢伙盯着女的。女的轉臉盯着男的。「阿要替小囡……？」</p>
<p>男的討厭地搖搖頭，「不要！」左手一擺，紙包兒　乘勢揑在手心裏。</p>
<p>女的低頭不響。</p>
<p>提小皮箱的那傢伙給糖放還箱子裏，蓋好，向那頭去了。不聲不響跟一個坐車的客人一樣。</p>
<p>有幾位像透了一口氣。小三等裏平靜了。</p>
<p>男的左手和右手放在一起，手背向上在做什麼。有一點拆紙的聲音。眼睛看着對面的客人，左手送到嘴邊。</p>
<p>女的掉臉一看，男的嘴有點兒動。</p>
<p>女的明白了，理開了手帕兒。慢慢地放開小紙包，偷眼看見一塊紫黑色的東西。「哦！……這就是……一她想。</p>
<p>看看對百有兩位客人也動着嘴，胆子一壯：一不會錯的！」於是她的嘴也略略動了一下。</p>
<p>可是那是誰？站在門口的遺是提小皮箱的那傢伙。鼓起一雙眼盯看她。</p>
<p>她臉一紅，低下頭。緊緊閉着嘴。</p>
<p>咕……。</p>
<p>男的用膀肘子碰她一下。「下去。」</p>
<p>走下電車，四面一看，巳種過了大馬路。她問：「這是……」？到這會兒才想到嘴裏還有塊糖。</p>
<p>「四馬路呀！」</p>
<p>「碎！」她吐出一口唾沫，紅紅的。「格種糖苦來！」（完）</p>

<h3 id="c212">舉辦苦兒參觀團的感想 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>中國兒童年的舉行，大家都知道享受幸福的，祗限於一部分中等以上家庭的兒女，至若大多數貧苦人家的孩子，仍要被擯在圈外。你看每次有兒童集會，作兒童代表，或登台跳葡萄仙子的，一定是穿漂亮新服裝的小弟妹，很少有襤褸的苦兒。這我們當然不能說是執事人不讓他們苦孩子參加，而是因為苦孩子沒有機會來趁熱閙。</p>
<p>這一回却破例了，苦孩子也得享受兒童年的幸福。最近本市兒童年實施委員會，舉辦一個苦兒參觀團，要到崑山去旅行。參加團員，以上海各慈善機關留養的苦兒為限，預定上海孤兒院八十人，中國救濟互助會江灣慈幼療養院八十人，貧民敎養院六十人，中華慈幼恊會慈幼敎養院六十人，閘北慈善團惠兒院二十人。參觀目的為崑山，搭京滬路火車往返。游覽地點為馬鞍山，公共體育塲，崑山公園，崑山農塲，環城馬路，及各苦兒留養機關。並擬在馬鞍山麓舉行一苦兒宴，由該會職員及當地黨政領袖，參加致詞。此舉原算不得是如何加惠苦孩子，但意義却是很好的。至少可以表示一點兒童年的精神，一方使這滲加參觀團的三百個苦兒，認識自己也有享受兒童年幸福的權利，一方使社會上一般人，不敢忽視苦兒的地位。</p>
<p>然而兒童年對於苦孩子所負的責任，比這更為重大。兒童年是全國兒童的兒童年，不是少數特殊階級兒童的兒童年。兒童年賜予苦孩子的幸福，不應是表面的，而須是眞實的幸福。一次的旅行，不過是給他們一個娛樂的機會而已。如何使他們的生活能得改善，這是我們必須關心的。故兒童年今後的工作，對於苦孩子，應負起敎養的重擔。兒童是社會的，國家的。貧苦人家沒有能力敎養孩子，須由社會來敎養。我們不能因為他們生而窮苦，便將他們遺忘了，苦孩子也是國家的主人翁，未來國家的運命，是放在他們身上的。</p>
<h3 id="c213">踱方步 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>晚飯後，孩子在桌邊打起瞌睡來。因為他吃得過飽，我拉了他的手，要他學着我的樣子在室內踱方步。他一邊靠在我身旁，慢慢地走，一邊用另一只手揉着惺忪的眼皮，那樣的免强和不高興。但是走過了四五個來回，他的睡魔逃走了，於是摔開我牽着的手，頑皮地反轉了，用十足的架子踱起方步來，一搖一擺地，像一個小丑。妻見了笑着對我說；「他學會了你愁苦的樣子，可惜他不會鎖起眉毛來用可怕的目光盯着人。否則，眞是一摸一樣！」</p>
<p>我就這樣地站住了，看着孩子踱方步。通常我被不能解决的事圍固着的時侯，總是反轉了手踱方步；這成了習慣。可是自己看不見自家那付小丑模樣，一搖一擺地；孩子却看在眼裏，一有他發展的機會，他馬上裝像那付模樣。我不願意在他純潔明心中留上這汚點，嚴厲叱着他，不許他把手反轉，不許小丑樣地一搖一擺，雖然他哭了，而妻也責我罵得毫無道理，我自己却後到了安慰，彷彿救活了一個人那樣；而且督責自己以後不要再做出那種怪樣來給孩子做榜樣。</p>
<p>我自己當然也不會創造出那種模樣來的，我是從父親那裏傳染的—這不是學問，不是財產，我要從我的孩子一代起戒除這惡習慣；這習慣不僅「難看」而已，是我父親終其生不得志的一個寫照，他是那樣鬱鬱而終的。</p>
<p>父親是個老秀才，沒有中舉，那是他終身的遺憾。他每次失敗歸家，總是把自己關在書房裏，不許家人進去，自已亦不出來，廢寢忘食地拚命讀書。父親是學傳，祖母十分疼愛，每次發書獃氣的時候，祗有祖母可以勸阻他。據祖母吿訴我，父親那時候的樣子才好看哩，掛了本書，一搖一擺地儘在書房裏轉圈子，簡直像痴子一樣，那時侯我哥哥祗有二歲，我還在襁褓之內，當然沒有見到父親踱方步的樣子。就是祖母講述那情形的時候，我們年紀還輕，見祖母笑，我們亦笑，對於踱方步還是猜想不出一個準確的樣子來的。我目睹父親僑小丑一搖一擺踱方步是在我們兄弟倆進大學讀書的時候，—自從淸室推翻，廢除科舉，父親就决意棄學習商，但是一個有書獃氣的讀書人要在刁奸欺詐的市儈們手中分飯吃，這是如何難能的事。而父親對於讀書還是那樣重視，他非要我們大學畢業不可。做生意既失敗，　付我們兄弟的學費就見得捉襟見肘了；我目睹父親的踱方步就在這個時候。他鎖緊了眉峯，反轉着兩手，一搖一擺，有時抽着烟捲，烟尾燒焦了他的指甲還沒有知道。看着父親拙於應付的焦急狀態，自己又沒有能力為父親分憂，我就跟着父親踱起方步來。最後一次是店裏的經理捲逃，被債權人逼得無路可走，我和父親兩個在店堂裏踱一個通宵；由於這變故，父親憂鬱而終。那一夜的影象，在我記憶之中是不能磨滅的。這個踱方步的一法了。孩子看在眼裏，他照模照樣地踱起來，我想到父親終生不得志而鬱鬱以終，自已又接手着父親的命運，看到孩子的踱方步，我不由地擔憂着這孩子是個第三代的犧牲者呵！</p>
<h3 id="c214">國際氣球比賽紀 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 水泉</p>
<p>戈登勃納杯國際氣球比賽，舉行數十年，航空界最感興趣，大銀杯為已故美人戈登勃納所捐贈，故名，創始於一八九四年，每年舉行一次，各國代表均有參加，惟氣球須由本國自製者為合格，獲勝之標準，以氣球昇空之高度，降落之遠度，及在空中停留之時間為準則，會章規定凡某國連勝三年者，得永遠保存此杯，比賽以來，各國互有勝負，美國數度連勝二次，但第三次卽被他國奪去，殊為可惜，一九三四年及一九三五年二次均為波蘭奪得冠軍，本年為緊要關頭，競爭亦更劇烈，結果復為波蘭所獲，連勝三次，遂得永遠保持此杯，另由波政府備製新銀杯，從明年起繼續舉行比賽，一切規則照舊。</p>
<p>參加者七國，按照會章，比賽地點應在前屆獲勝國之京城舉行，故本年九月十五日在波蘭京城之華沙舉行，參加者七國，計為美，法，德，比，紐西蘭，波蘭，及瑞士，地點在飛機塲，是日波蘭大總統莫錫斯基，各部部長，各國駐波大使武官等均蒞臨觀賽，民衆趕往者達十餘萬人，十分熱鬧，下午三時行開幕禮，總統致辭，四時開始比賽。</p>
<p>十三個氣球，參加比賽之氣球共有十三個，外部繪成各種顏色，鮮艷美觀，未飛昇前由每駕航員作無綫電播音演說三分鐘，四時正，第一個氣球飛昇上空，未幾，十三個氣球先後陸續出發，飄蕩空際，漸飛漸遠，小如流星，隱約歸去，斯時軍樂高奏，觀衆陸續散去。</p>
<p>在俄境降落，比賽結果，第一名為波蘭潘聲斯基大佐偕助手維索斯某所駕之波羅尼亞氣球，計降落遠度為一千六百啟羅米突强，高度為一千英里强，在俄境伏而加河降落，第二名亦為波蘭氣球名華沙者所得，遠度為一千五百啟羅米突，在俄境麥基司克附近降落，第三名為比國，第四名為德國，第五名為波蘭，第六名為紐西蘭，第七名為法國，第八名亦為法國，第九名比國，第十名瑞士，第十一名德國，第十二名德國，美國氣球海軍號殿軍。</p>
<p>優勝者獎金，氣球比賽之優勝者，除銀杯外，尙有現金獎勵，計第一名得一萬波幣，第二名七千波幣，第三名四千波幣，其次為二千五百，一千五百，一千二百，一千，及八百波幣不等，獎金由波總統莫錫斯基，及交部部長，外交部長，陸軍部長等所捐贈。</p>
<p>氣球之製造，波蘭連勝三次後，比賽近五十年之戈登勃納杯乃永久為波蘭所有，獲國際上無上榮譽，一般參與比賽者之觀察，波蘭之獲勝純由氣球製造之優異，咸認為世界製造科學及體育用途之氣球，自當首推波蘭，聞比國大科學家璧克敎授曾乘氣球飛昇同溫層作科學探討，近電波京，特定製一新氣球，為其再度作科學探險之用云。</p>

<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>銅匠張四官近來一直在煩悶着：店裏已經有二個月沒有生活做，而自己的女人，則肚子一天天地在大起來，已經趕到生產的光景了。</p>
<p>望着三個小孩子！二個男的，一個女的！在門口玩要，心裏就抖起來：已經有了三個小的還養不活，再來是不得了。這年頭，窮人生孩子，簡直是造孽啊！</p>
<p>可是有什麽辦法呢？第四個又快要來了，四官夫妻倆年紀已不算得輕，他們是喜歡小孩子的，可是在近來生况中，父親的責任使他發政抖，瞧着目前的三個孩子：飢瘦，襤褸，汚穢，他像感到犯了洗不去的大罪似的，沒有一個時候不抱着一種苦痛的難受的歉意。</p>
<p>是我害了你們，是我害了你們了！你們的「命」那樣的壞，為什麽要投生到我這裏來呢？</p>
<p>有的時候，走過街，在「設備完善」的小學校鐵門縫裏張一下，瞧着那些活潑可愛的幸福的孩子，自己就想起了家裏的三個野狗樣的小東西了：大實八歲了，也該進學校去念書了啊，像他們那些孩子一樣的，上早操，「一，二，三，四！」，唱小麻雀，跳跳笑笑；可是…可是自己的孩子們是整天的放在街上流浪的…</p>
<p>那麽着，心裏就像刀刺一樣的，煩悶着，苦惱着，拚命地思索着，像瘋了似的。</p>
<p>可是左右的鄰居却徧對他說着種可恨的，在他看來簡直像是嘰刺的，說不完的話語：</p>
<p>「恭喜你啊，四官嫂足月了，恭喜你添個白白壯壯的男孩子，請我們吃幾個紅蛋啊。」</p>
<p>可是，四官却感到一種難受的侮辱：「恭你娘的喜！這年頭還生孩子！討債鬼啊！老子養不活他們，這回生下來，抱到育嬰堂去算了。」</p>
<p>女人聽見了可發了急：「什麽話？你在說的什麽話呀？你瘋了嗎？你眞的…？」</p>
<p>「你知道點什麼！沒生活做，你還要像母猪婆那樣的養下來！養不活呀，你知道嗎！」</p>
<p>女人哭起來了：「狠心的啊！你說什麽話！你忍心把孩子抱到育嬰堂去，我去吿你，我去，我…和你拚命！你這狼心狗肺的…！</p>
<p>然而，到了晚上，到人靜的時候，四官輕輕的對女人說：「招弟，這次你得體諒我啊，我不是那種人，我也喜歡孩子。然而，二個月沒有生活了啊，要是送了他到…去，也許他還過到更好一點的日子哩！至少總不會餓死了。阿招，你想一想，你要體諒我啊！」</p>
<p>女人不說話，眼睜睜地望着四官的臉，半響，她嗚嗚咽咽地哭起來了…</p>
<p>於是，日子一天地過去。終於在一個夜晚。在陣痛的轉側中，在難受的呻吟中，在鄰家婦人的帮助中，在剪刀與水聲響中，一個新的生命終於出生到這世界上來了，帶着無休止的屈强與憤恨的，不熟鍊的哭聲。</p>
<p>「一個男孩子啊，恭喜你啊！」那麽說着。</p>
<p>四官的耳朶是再也受不住這些話語了。「倒底生下來了，」像去了一個重負那樣的，那喘過一口積抑了好久的氣；到人散去了以後，他用着抽去了戚覺的腦子與一隻抖動的手，從床上抱起那初生的小孩，在女人的頭邊說了一句，「阿招，你得體諒我啊！」便抱了孩子，衝向門外的黑暗的街道去了。</p>
<p>外面索索的下着雨，在窗下，他聽見屋子裏面女人的隱隱的哭聲。</p>

<p>—夏佩珍公開伴舞—</p>
<p>這是一個「刺激」消息，屬於上海的愛刺激的朋友們！</p>
<p>新光大戲院將要開映快活林公司出品，夏佩珍主演的「小姨」這個有聲片子，在這偭片子開映的同時，還有一倘名字呌做「鄕下大姑娘加冠典禮」的「短小精悍」的趣劇，給你們一個半小時的贈品。</p>
<p>在這個短劇裏，除開了充分的趣味之外，據說它更是具有着極多諷刺的意味，這個諷刺據說針對着某一個加冠　和某一個人物的。夏佩珍一直是被呌做「鄉下姑娘」的，她就是親自登臺演那位加冠的「鄕下大姑娘」，但是，除了這個「鄕下大姑娘」之外，你應該意想到另外一個加冠的「鄕下姑娘」，這里姑且勿論。</p>
<p>在這個「趣劇」的演出裏，加冠之後的夏佩珍可以公開伴舞，除了臺上的一些舞客之外，裏底下的觀衆也儘可走上裏去請舞，而就在這些舞客的羣衆裏，又藏了一位戲劇裏的人物，這是一位「鄕下老頭子」，飾演者是臉肖韓蘭根而演技絕端不同的滑稽人物趙突山，這位「鄕下老頭子」也有一遍極有趣而極够諷　的臺詞，等着瞧罷。</p>
<p>這個「噱頭」，應該是非常的新鮮吧？</p>

<h3 id="c223">「花燭之夜」開工大吉 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>粗綫條導演岳楓機「逃亡」後之新作「花燭之夜」，經過數月間的愼重籌備，已於日昨正式開始工作了。</p>
<p>此劇係以現代婚姻為主題，解剖現代婚姻的美德和缺德，這中間包括了自由婚姻，舊制婚姻等各方面的男女間的大大小小的問題。</p>
<p>劇中人的分配又甚有趣，小女伶袁美雲飾大胖子關宏達的妻室，而小鳥兒周璇却又飾彼倆的女婢。這中聞有着一段很奇趣的羅曼斯，即是袁美雲最厭惡的是其丈夫關宏達的壽頭壽腦，但是周璇却喜歡他，所以關呆子雖一方受美妻袁美雲的奚落，然而一面却受嬌婢周璇的靑睞，所以他是「花燭之夜」中最幸運的一人，此外王引飾一著作家，他是不滿於其浪漫的摩登妻子，（此角色尙在物色中）而終於出走，到後來由於同病相憐而和袁美雲宣吿同居。所以說「花燭之夜」不僅劇情富於興趣，就是劇中角色的支配也都很有興味的。</p>

<p>趙丹在中國的劇壇上，可以說是一個中心人物，這次欽差大臣的演出，本來有他的重頭戲，惟他方在大病之後，不克登臺，眞是今年度舞臺上的一筆損失。現在仍以舞臺監督由他和籟天先生分任，眞可謂生死不離舞臺矣。</p>
<p>離演出前五日，欽差大臣中的要角顧而已君亦忽罹傷寒症，幸得張子平醫師細心視診，始得痊愈，此亦眞所謂大幸中之大幸。</p>
<p>最近又聞導演之一的章泥先生，亦以　月來積勞過度，幸未睡倒耳。</p>
<p>追溯趙丹病因，於第一次之努力排演「娜拉」亦不無有點因由，藝術家為求藝術的眞實與深造，常常是不顧着生命的，今觀趙，顧，章的罹疾，益可信矣。</p>

<h3 id="e33">Preparing Former President Li's State Funeral <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Capital</p>
<p>The passing of Huangpi (Li Yuanhong) has been over seven years. We always admire this president, who was known for his integrity and purity of character. Recently, the National Government issued a clear order to prepare for a state funeral and appointed Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, to oversee the arrangements. Moreover, the Executive Yuan meeting the day before yesterday decided to allocate an additional 10,000 yuan for the state funeral expenses, to facilitate its swift completion and avoid delays. This clearly shows the central government's intention not to forget the sages and to praise them, and it is also a deserved reward for Huangpi's dedication to the Republic of China. Those who reflect on Huangpi's past achievements should feel a sense of righteousness and express their joy. Furthermore, we believe that if the state funeral for former President Li were only motivated by rewarding merit and honoring accomplishments, it would not fully reveal the true meaning of this event. We must select the magnanimous and brilliant aspects of Li Gong's life and deeds that are worthy of eternal remembrance, repeatedly emphasize and appreciate them. Then, the impression given by the state funeral will have a more profound significance.</p>
<p>Li Gong was a military man with a long history of service, bearing the merit and reputation of leading the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, a feat recorded in history. He received widespread respect and reached the highest position. However, due to his kind and generous nature, he struggled to restore order. He remained low-profile and unassuming, transcending worldly affairs. Judging by the weight of the nation's trust, he may not have fully satisfied the expectations of the people. However, considering his self-discipline and unyielding integrity, he was undoubtedly an outstanding figure of his time. How can he not only be admired by his contemporaries but also serve as a model for today? At the beginning of Yuan Shikai's administration, sycophants competed to offer flattery, and many people were eager to seek personal gain and used nominal positions as rewards and official ranks as incentives. Corrupt practices prevailed, and it became difficult to distinguish right from wrong. Seeing the danger of the times, Li Gong deeply deplored the corruption of officials. He sent letters to Yuan Shikai and the heads of various departments, expressing his sincere advice and offering thorough admonitions. He also telegraphed various provinces to denounce the malpractices of the time. Newspapers at the time published his words widely, shocking the entire nation. Later, when Yuan Shikai attempted to become emperor, Li Gong immediately resigned and prepared to leave. Yuan tried to lure him with the title of Prince Wuyi, but Li firmly refused. When Hongxian's meritorious officials coerced him to attend court, Li swore to resist until death. His unwavering sense of righteousness left even Yuan Shikai helpless. Regarding his personal choices, he always prioritized loyalty to Qingjie (the Qing Dynasty). From the Wuchang Uprising to the establishment of order, he only took twenty gold coins to provide for the expenses of his horse. When he became president, he repeatedly reduced the expenses of the presidential palace and refused the supply from the Chongwenmen Customs. These are all clear examples of his character. Today, government officials are striving to cultivate integrity, eliminate corruption, and punish corrupt officials, as has been repeatedly proclaimed. However, there are still few officials who dare to speak out, and the trend of seeking personal gain is difficult to curb. The concern for the integrity of the nation in times of upheaval should be a priority for those in power. Therefore, how can we not deeply admire and emulate a former president who was so honest, self-respecting, upright, and unyielding? The nation faces difficult times, and there is a pressing need for reform. The gradual improvement of morals will begin here.</p>

<p>(London) British and French naval experts held their first joint meeting this morning at the British Admiralty to prepare for the London Naval Conference, which will open on December 2. They discussed ways to enable Britain and France to cooperate in the Mediterranean in accordance with Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant, especially on how the French Navy would take over when the British Navy withdraws its warships from the Mediterranean, and the issue of the British Navy using French naval ports. However, this Anglo-French naval cooperation will only be effective when sanctions are implemented. The French experts attending the naval conference are Admiral Dego and Captain Louis. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The actions of Britain and the United States towards Japan before the opening of the disarmament conference are attracting much attention. According to information from the Havas News Agency, Ambassador Sato in France reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the U.S. government, in its reply to the League of Nations regarding the Italian sanctions issue, reiterated its consistent stance of upholding peace and supporting Britain's position. This was decided after a week of secret negotiations between Britain and the United States. Therefore, Britain agreed to maintain the U.S. position of opposing equality with Japan and opposing reducing the tonnage of battleships as the price for supporting Britain's position. (Dentsu, 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson today secretly ordered the directors of naval shipyards to accelerate the completion of shipbuilding plans in order to reach the naval strength limited by the treaty as soon as possible. He stated that the 524 ships must be launched, which would also provide jobs for many unemployed Americans. (Guomin, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Rear Admiral Stoddard, former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet and now commander of the Third Naval District, published an article in the Naval Institute Proceedings today, stating that after the European situation stabilizes, Western naval powers will seek to restore their power in the East. He also said that countries will engage in extreme shipbuilding competition due to Germany's naval recovery. In this situation, Germany will build at least five battleships and two aircraft carriers, rendering the British fleet powerless. France and Italy will certainly not be left behind, and the U.S. and Japan will actively replenish their fleets. Japan will act freely in China due to the unrest in Europe. If so, the powers with significant interests in the East will certainly not be willing to give up their right to speak on Far Eastern affairs. (Guomin, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The Admiralty recently signed a contract with a large machine factory in Birkenhead to install new engines on the battlecruiser Renown. The Renown is currently in the Strait of Gibraltar, built in 1916, with a displacement of 26,000 tons, armor up to 9 inches thick, and equipped with six 15-inch guns and fifteen 4-inch guns. The battleship Hood, with a displacement of 42,000 tons, is also in the Strait of Gibraltar and is one of the largest warships in the British Navy. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<p>(London) British and French experts are now striving to find the greatest possible concessions that can be offered to Mussolini while adhering to the principles of the League of Nations, in order to end the Italian-Ethiopian war as soon as possible. However, it is widely believed that the talks currently underway in Paris are highly fluid. Officials claim that their purpose is to decide how to respond to Italy's proposals. It is expected that Italy's proposals will be submitted to the League of Nations Council within the next few days. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) British Ambassador to Italy Drummond met with Mussolini for a long time today. This meeting is regarded here as "most important," but its content remains confidential. (Guomin, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini discussed with British Ambassador to Rome Sir Eric Drummond for an hour today. The nature of their conversation has not been disclosed. According to a government spokesperson, diplomatic contacts are still ongoing, but there have been no discussions regarding proposals to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian war. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) British sources say that both Britain and Italy are now striving for the success of negotiations. It is generally believed that the Prime Minister and Drummond have studied the various elements for resolving the dispute, but their content is quite different from the conditions revealed in the newspapers last week. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval received the Italian Ambassador to France Cerutti at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) In recent days, there has been widespread concern that Britain and France have reached an agreement to implement sanctions against Italy and are seeking to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute on a basis that Italy cannot accept. Now, these concerns have been dispelled. Since British Ambassador to Italy Drummond met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday afternoon, government officials have announced that direct negotiations between Britain and Italy have resumed. It is believed that Britain will soon present Italy with proposals to resolve the dispute. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Petit Parisien today, the content of the Anglo-French peace plan is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Appoint an Italian as an advisor to the Ethiopian Emperor.</p>
<p>(2) Appoint an Italian as the local administrator of a border province of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>(3) Deploy "foreign troops" manned by Italians.</p>
<p>(4) Cede the Ogaden province to Italy. The boundaries of the entire Tigray province and the Danakil region will be determined later.</p>
<p>(5) Provide Ethiopia with a corridor to the sea. (Guomin, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Petit Parisien, although British and French experts have recently drafted proposals in Paris to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, they have not yet been accepted by Britain and France. They will now be jointly discussed by British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval in Geneva. The content of these draft proposals is to implement the international assistance plan recommended by the Five-Power Committee of the League of Nations Council on September 18 in central Ethiopia. For the border provinces of Ethiopia, it is proposed that the Ethiopian Emperor hire Italian advisors stationed in the Ethiopian capital, so that Italy can exercise administrative power in these provinces. However, the southern provinces of Harar and Ogaden will not be completely annexed by Italy. Ethiopia will only cede a portion of the Ogaden province to Italy in exchange for a seaport in Italian Eritrea. The newspaper also said that the British government's position is to firmly adhere to the actions taken by the League of Nations. Therefore, the proposals drafted by the British and French experts may not be directly accepted. It is likely that the League of Nations will use the recommendations of the Five-Power Committee and the recommendations of the British and French experts as a basis to formulate a new plan to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute before it can be accepted. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Soir today published an authorized article on the progress of peace talks to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian war, stating that British and French representatives met last Sunday and agreed on several proposals to be submitted to the British government and telegraphed to Rome. It is heard that these proposals allow Italy to rule several provinces of Ethiopia, but do not include Harar, the holy city of Aksum, or western Ethiopia, because the Ethiopian Emperor will certainly oppose this cession.

<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Hoare gave a speech to voters in his constituency of Chelsea this afternoon, dispelling the strange and ridiculous atmosphere created by some political critics regarding the peace talks. He said that some people mistakenly suspect that "we are now abandoning the League of Nations and colluding with Italy behind its back." This kind of concern is unfounded. Hoare confirmed that Britain and France are currently discussing the Italian-Ethiopian peace talks in Paris, saying that Pederson, the director of the Abyssinian division of the Foreign Office, is currently discussing some complex details with French Foreign Office officials. Nothing has been disclosed yet. If there is a decision, it will be reported to the League of Nations as soon as possible. The Foreign Secretary reiterated that any resolution must be achieved within the framework of the League of Nations and satisfy the League of Nations, Italy, and Ethiopia. Everything is transparent, and there is no cause for suspicion. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the reactions of various countries to the peace plan drafted by the British and French experts are mixed. London is keeping silent about it, but there is much speculation about the meeting between British Ambassador Drummond and Mussolini in Rome. Geneva believes that any compromise is difficult to accept by both Italy and Ethiopia, as well as the member states of the League of Nations. Rome declares, "We are not very optimistic about such plans." As for the Ethiopian capital, officials reiterated their previous position, namely the Ethiopian Emperor's statement that Ethiopia refuses to cede Tigray. (Guomin, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia published an article by the famous Italian writer Gaeta, expressing disappointment at the failure of the recent peace talks, saying that Britain and France, because of the great sacrifices Italy made in the European war, have resumed their Versailles cooperation in order to curb Italy's necessary colonial expansion. Italy must disregard the friendship of the two countries and other countries for its own needs and interests. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the government has decided to instruct Ambassador Drummond in Italy to notify the Italian government that Britain has decided to withdraw several British warships stationed in the Mediterranean. This decision is the result of an agreement between Britain and France, and its purpose is to ease the situation. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) In the Admiralty's opinion, a portion of the British Mediterranean Fleet needs to be recalled to the UK, and French warships can take over their duties. On the 28th of this month, France replied to the British note, allowing the British Navy to receive assistance from the French Navy if it is attacked while implementing sanctions. Subsequently, the two countries continued to hold talks and reached an agreement on the following two points: (1) If British warships in the Mediterranean are recalled to the UK, they will be taken over by French warships. Because of this agreement, Britain will now notify Italy of the withdrawal of several warships stationed in the Mediterranean. (2) The British Navy can use several French naval bases. The detailed arrangements for this will be discussed by British and French naval experts before the naval conference opens on December 2. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval are currently discussing how the two countries should help each other if they are attacked by Italy while implementing sanctions. Regarding this, France argues that if its land borders are attacked, Britain should immediately provide assistance, especially in the air force. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Some political figures have stated that the British War Office and Admiralty have agreed to offer special guarantees to France as the basis for a general appeasement of Europe. Lord Rothermere, a key figure in the Conservative Party, previously advocated a defensive alliance with France. This proposal is now being promoted again. Regarding the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, it is heard that negotiations are being held between Britain and France in order to draft joint proposals to be submitted to both Italy and Ethiopia. It is generally hoped that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will gradually understand the dangers of financial and economic sanctions, and his attitude will no longer be as firm as before. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, key staff members of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force will arrive here today from Paris to discuss the naval conference and other issues specifically related to Europe with British experts. It is heard that British Ambassador to Italy Drummond notified Italian Prime Minister Mussolini of this matter yesterday. (Havas, 30th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The government recently issued a communiqué stating that General De Bono, High Commissioner for East Africa, telegraphed that Italian patrols encountered and repelled a unit of Ethiopian troops yesterday. Several chiefs of Tigray province later surrendered to the Italian authorities in Adowa. At present, all preparations for transportation of supplies and food have been completed. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Italian Front: Italian troops are expected to launch a major offensive soon on both the northern and southern fronts. The northern front aims at the city of Magala, and the southern front aims to attack the town of Gorahai. Recent Italian reconnaissance has proved that the villages between Adigrat and Magala on the northern front can be easily occupied by Italian troops, allowing artillery to advance through these villages towards Magala. On the southern front, General Graziani, commander-in-chief of the Italian Somaliland front, is preparing everything to attack the town of Gorahai. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Ministry of War announced today that Italian Dubat (native troops) defeated Ethiopian troops between Sheray and Grahai, capturing 722 rifles. The number of casualties has not been estimated, but it is said that after this battle, Italian troops advanced victoriously and occupied Ethiopian territory to the banks of the Takaze River. (Guomin, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Italian troops on both the northern and southern fronts are preparing to advance into central Ethiopia. British military experts are deeply skeptical about whether the Italian troops will eventually achieve victory. Experts claim that General De Bono, commander of the northern front, commanding three divisions of 180,000 troops, is now fighting against the terrain and the weather, which will subject the Italian military strategy to a major test. They admit that capturing Magala is indeed easy, but after capturing it, the advancing troops will encounter real difficulties. The left wing of the northern army is currently based in Adigrat. British experts state that this army is mostly composed of irregular troops and surrendered Ethiopian troops and Italian Eritrean troops, with a heterogeneous military organization. This army is closest to Quqdaft, but the terrain is extremely rugged, with many peaks and deep ravines. The central and winged armies are equipped with tanks and artillery, but they must cross mountains 9,000 feet high and pass through desolate areas where Ethiopian guerrillas may be lurking to attack. Experts therefore state that road construction is the most important task for the Italian troops. (Guomin, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to a report from the Italian Southern Front headquarters today, Italian tanks attacked the Ethiopian positions in front of Hilaf on the right wing of the Italian troops currently advancing along the Webi Shebelle River, assisted by bombing aircraft. Due to rain, visibility was poor, so the attack was not very convenient, but the goal was still achieved. The Ethiopian troops are still retreating along the Ogaden line, apparently planning to defend the mountains. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Italian Front: Italian troops have now established contact between Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. Two columns of Italian troops departing from Somaliland, one having crossed the Wardair and advanced into the sparsely populated sandy mining area, the other divided into two teams, advancing separately towards the town of Gorahai along the Webi Giarer River. The Ethiopian troops in that area are soldiers from the Amhara and Shoa tribes, all carrying their families and slaves. On the Eritrean front, there are small skirmishes between Italian and Ethiopian troops along the Setit River. On October 8 and 9, 3,000 Ethiopian troops attempted to cross the Setit River and enter Eritrean territory, but were unsuccessful. There were many casualties on both sides in this battle. It is heard that there are currently about 10,000 Ethiopian troops concentrated in the Setit River basin. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Ethiopian Capital: It was learned today that senior Ethiopian generals have apparently allowed Italian troops on the northern front to penetrate 125 miles into the central highlands. The first major battle will take place in the mountains 100 miles east of Lake Tana, the source of the Blue Nile. Residents are now fleeing Magala, which is only 12 miles from the town. Officials believe that the claim that 20,000 Ethiopian troops have been killed on the northern front is unfounded. So far, the Italian troops have only encountered guerrilla resistance.

The League of Nations Secretariat published the following statistics for these responses: A total of 40 countries have implemented an embargo on military supplies to Italy; 36 countries have adopted financial and economic sanctions; and 18 countries have accepted economic assistance to countries participating in the sanctions.

<p>Ottawa Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King recently announced that the government is prepared to implement sanctions against Italy. He stated that the government has not accepted any obligations regarding military sanctions, so this should not be an issue. Although the government has approved the sanctions measures this time, this should not be taken as a precedent for future actions. In other words, if future international disputes arise that necessitate sanctions, the government will consider the matter separately at that time. As for the present situation, the Canadian government has decided to take appropriate measures immediately to prevent Italy from issuing public bonds in Canada, prohibit loans to Italy, and prohibit the export of arms, ammunition, and military supplies to Italy. However, the prohibition of Italian goods from entering Canada and the prohibition of exporting essential military industrial materials to Italy will be coordinated with the member states of the League of Nations.

<p>(Rome) Italy is consolidating its economic position today, preparing to wage a trade war against countries that have implemented economic sanctions. The government has issued orders to restrict the consumption of meat, electricity, coal, and other necessities, while the public has launched a movement to promote domestic goods. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) During the period of sanctions imposed by the League of Nations, Italy has decided that the state will control the national economy. The methods are divided into three categories: (1) Reduce consumption; (2) Control international trade and reduce imports; and (3) Increase domestic production. The following measures have been taken regarding the first item, reducing consumption: (1) Force public buses to convert to carbon gas fuel, every week; (2) Prohibit the sale of meat for two days each week; (3) Require each restaurant to serve only one dish per customer once a week; (4) Limit the length of newspapers and magazines. In addition, to save fuel, the government has set fixed working hours for government agencies, from 8:00 AM to 12:30 PM and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Government agencies should first reduce the length and number of their publications. The size of official letterhead and envelopes used by government agencies will also be reduced. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government has begun a nationwide campaign to urge people to stop buying all non-essential foreign goods. In addition, the government will soon issue an order prohibiting the import of goods from countries imposing sanctions on Italy. Even if the sanctions are lifted in the future, the import of goods from these countries will be prohibited unless they purchase an equivalent amount of goods from Italy in return. Furthermore, Italy's coal purchases from Britain have decreased sharply in the past six months, while coal purchases from Germany have increased significantly. As for oil, large quantities have been purchased and stored, and it is hoped that supplies will continue to be provided by the United States. Timber can be supplied by Austria. If Italy refuses to purchase meat from the Soviet Union, Argentina, and Yugoslavia due to their participation in sanctions, it will turn to Brazil for purchases, as Brazil is not a member of the League of Nations.

<p>(London) Although the Ethiopian army is avoiding a major decisive battle with the Italian army on the Wolkayte front, it appears that Magal will be the site of the first major battle since the outbreak of war between Italy and Ethiopia. Italian aircraft have reconnoitered the city today and discovered that a strong Ethiopian army is stationed there. The exact number is unknown, but it is believed that they are numerous. Aircraft opened fire to assist, intending to defend against the Italian army there.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Italian army in Eritrean Ili'itri, the Italian army on the northern route began its advance on October 26th and has now occupied the land between the Tekeze River and the Merara River tributaries. The Second Army Corps has advanced to the Fefe watershed, a tributary of the Tekeze River. The outposts are often heavily sniped at night by the Ethiopian army, but there has been no fierce resistance so far. After three days of attack, the Italian army on the northern route has entered waterlogged terrain, so the military strategy is now more convenient than before. At the same time, the area southwest of Eritrean Ili'itri, bounded by the Setit River, is little known. The battle has been ongoing for a month. The area is hot and humid, with marshes and plantations interspersed. There are also many wild animals. The Italian army denies that the river army has invaded Eritrean Ili'itri, saying that the Italian side is defending a 50-mile-long river with very few soldiers, resisting several Ethiopian teams, each with about 500 soldiers. The Italian army ambushes the riverbank with machine guns, opening fire when Ethiopians attempt to drive cattle and sheep to the water. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(TASS, Vladivostok, October 6) Kornytsky, of the Far Eastern Branch of the Blood Transfusion Institute, discovered that ordinary tea contains a large amount of Vitamin C. One gram of dried tea contains 4 to 6 milligrams of Vitamin C. Drinking 3 to 5 grams of tea per day can prevent anemia, and drinking 6 to 10 grams of tea per day can cure anemia. Kornytsky's discovery is of great interest in theory, because Vitamin C is easily destroyed by oxygen in the air, so it almost completely disappears in dried vegetables and dried fruits. Kornytsky pointed out that dry tea contains concentrated Vitamin C due to certain chemical characteristics of dry tea leaves that contain certain enzymes. Experiments have proven that the way tea preserves vitamins can be artificially manufactured and used for other plants containing vitamins. This makes the manufacturing of anti-anemia foods and the preservation of vitamins in dried fruits and vegetables easier to implement. This discovery is of great benefit because it can meet the sorely felt need for foods rich in Vitamin C.</p>

<h3 id="e85">The Course of the Italian Occupation of Adowa and Future Difficulties After the Start of the War Against Abyssinia <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Roman Correspondence</p>
<p>The war between Italy and Abyssinia began "unofficially" on October 2nd. The so-called unofficial start is another way of saying "undeclared war." In fact, the two sides have already engaged in artillery fire and hand-to-hand combat. In order to cater to the general oral advocacy of those who oppose war, the word "war" is abandoned and not mentioned, thereby avoiding bearing the legal responsibility for engaging in war. On the afternoon of the 2nd, Italy held a national general mobilization exercise. On the same day, it "resisted" Abyssinia in Africa, held a large-scale bombing in the skies over the black empire, and the army advanced on multiple routes at the same time. From then on, the disaster of war began. On the fourth day after the start of the war, Italy occupied Adowa in Abyssinia. The land is located in the northwestern part of Abyssinia and is close to Italian-owned Eritrea. Forty years ago (March 1, 1896), the Italian army lost contact between its left and right wings and was defeated here by Abyssinia. As a result, a treaty of peace was signed, promising Abyssinia's independence (before this, Abyssinia was an Italian protectorate). This was certainly a disgrace in the eyes of the Italians, and the Fascist Party government, which prides itself on restoring the glory of the ancient Roman Empire, sought to reoccupy the area as soon as possible to vent its accumulated resentment. On the day of the occupation (the 6th of this month), which was a Sunday, all newspapers suspended publication. The central party department also widely printed and posted in the streets Propaganda Department Bulletin No. 14 (in modern Italian history, this bulletin has become an immortal document). For a time, slogans and catchphrases such as "Adowa is ours!" could be seen everywhere. Crowds gathered in groups, parading in the streets, shouting slogans, and two-color national flags were hung in every household in the city to celebrate the victory. In the evening, even more crowds held torches and demonstrated everywhere, the most lively of which was the Venice Square in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The Italian people are originally sanguine, passionate and romantic, and have a strong sense of patriotism. This time, the reoccupation of Adowa eliminated the shame of forty years in one day and was the first victory in the advance into Abyssinia. No wonder the public celebrated like crazy.</p>
<p>That Abyssinia lost a city after only three or four days of fighting between the two sides was indeed due to the strength of Italy's military power, but whether Abyssinia had put up a fierce resistance is a question that everyone is jointly doubting and exploring. Regarding the fall of Adowa, there are two theories: one is that Italy first carried out heavy bombing with its fierce air force, and then the army advanced in total, but still encountered a counterattack from Abyssinian convoys. Soldiers on both sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat with short swords and bayonets, resulting in serious casualties (700 Italian deaths and more than 1,300 Abyssinian deaths). The British Times has described it as Hand-to-hand Battle. The other theory is that although Adowa is a large city on the northwestern border of Abyssinia, it is not a key location. It is quite far from the Abyssinian capital Addis Ababa. The Abyssinian king knew that the Italian army had been defeated in that area in the past, and this time it would spare no sacrifice to reoccupy it. Instead of greatly damaging its military strength for this one city, it would be better to preserve its vitality and plan for the main battle in the interior. Therefore, abandoning Adowa may have been a predetermined military plan of Abyssinia. In any case, Italy has finally occupied this city, and it is also a good propaganda tool to encourage the public, inspire the army, and continue to advance. In terms of the matter itself, it is indeed a great victory, and it is almost undeniable. What is concerning is that although the occupation of Adowa is a major victory (and the advance has continued in recent days, and almost the entire Tigray region of Abyssinia has been occupied by the Italian army), the difficulties encountered after this victory and the difficulty in dealing with them will increase day by day.</p>
<p>From a military point of view, regardless of which of the above two theories is true, it is generally recognized that Abyssinia fiercely resisted the Italian army. In terms of weapons, Italy has airplanes, cannons, and all the latest scientific killing tools. When necessary, it may even have military equipment that is more potent than dumdum bullets and poison gas. Abyssinia has no possibility of comparison and resistance on this point. However, Abyssinia is mountainous, the African climate is unfavorable to airplanes and ordinary soldiers, and the situation is not to be taken lightly. Its people are fierce, brave, and good at fighting. Although the Italians are enthusiastic, when faced with them, they will also be difficult enemies to deal with. However, modern warfare is not only a struggle of physical strength but also a struggle of intelligence and scientific tools. On this point, it is Abyssinia's greatest weakness. Forty years ago, Abyssinia may have been able to subdue the Italian army temporarily, but in today's era, forty years later, Italy's progress is enough to overcome Abyssinia dozens of times over. Abyssinia has no air force strength to speak of (it is said that there are only six airplanes, two of which cannot even fight), which is not enough to withstand a single blow from Italy. Even in terms of the army, although the Italian army does not have deep war experience (most of those fighting in Africa this time are young people around the age of twenty. Although veterans of the last war have voluntarily requested to participate and have been promised by Mussolini to be allowed to organize a "Typha Division," they have not yet set out), they are specially trained on weekdays, and their discipline and combat power are top-notch. They are also motivated by patriotic emotions, brave and good at fighting, which Abyssinia may not be able to resist.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on this situation, what can be speculated is that if no other forces come out to obstruct and only allow the Italian and Abyssinian sides to fight against each other, then the Italian army's occupation of the Abyssinian capital Addis Ababa may also be possible in a short period of time. However, whether the Geneva side (in fact, the League of Nations is currently controlled by Britain, that is, the British side) can allow the Italian army to continue to advance so aggressively is still an unknown number. Today, our newspaper reporter went out to buy the British Times and the Daily Mail, etc., searching from Venice Square to the Clonei Square in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the railway station, etc., but could not find them anywhere. When asked, the newspaper vendors said that they had not arrived today or that they had already been sold out. Later, after passing by a British friend's place, I learned that after the League of Nations Administrative Council's decision on the 8th that Italy had violated the covenant, the British newspaper's criticism may be valued by the Italians, or it may not be what the Italians want to make public to the masses. For the past two days, the League of Nations General Assembly has begun to discuss the issue of economic sanctions against Italy. If this proposal can be implemented, given Italy's current lack of raw materials and poor financial situation, Italy will indeed feel great pain. However, no matter how diplomatic circumstances develop, Mussolini is determined to move forward. It can be asserted that (sent late on October 10)</p>

<p>The case of firearms being stolen from the Xiahengjing sentry post in the seventh district of the county has caused concern in the local area. After County Magistrate Li personally went to search for and arrest the robbers without success, he recently stepped up the strict investigation of the affiliated teams, hoping to bring them to justice. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 27th, more than 20 armed bandits suddenly broke into the home of Wang Heshang in Zhujia Hang in the same district, breaking down doors and windows. While they were looting, neighbors heard the commotion. Coincidentally, the seventh patrol team of the patrol station was passing by and was also reported to the guard station in the town, which dispatched a team to rush to the scene. They surrounded the house from two sides and tried to arrest the robbers, but the bandits, relying on their sophisticated weapons and large number of people, broke through the encirclement and fled south, firing their guns along the way to resist. The surrounding team members, unable to match the enemy in numbers, did not give chase. Punan, along the coast, is a haven for bandits who frequently cause disturbances. If they are not eradicated at the root, the future consequences will be endless.</p>

He previously served as the business director of the Fuzhou China Merchants Bureau and as the acting director, engaging in private gain and embezzlement. After the case was uncovered, Yan secretly fled to Suzhou. On the evening of the 29th, the Wuxian District Court suddenly received a telegram from the Fuzhou District Court, entrusting it to arrest and search for evidence. That night at 10:00 PM, Prosecutor Lu, together with bailiffs and police officers from the police station, surrounded Yan's residence and arrested Yan Zhongwei. They also obtained a large box of China Merchants Bureau account books, which were taken to the court together. After questioning Yan overnight, he was ordered to be detained. On the 30th, the Fuzhou District Court was notified and requested to send personnel to Suzhou to escort him back for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Wuxi: Money Shop Runner Flees with Embezzled Funds <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xichen, a runner at the Ruichangrun Money Shop (managed by Wu Buzhou) in Jiangyin Lane, Wuxi, is from Jiangyin, in his early twenties. He has always been quite loyal to his duties. Recently, Zhang personally failed in trading soybeans and other goods on the exchange, suffering heavy losses. He had previously borrowed 1,000 yuan from Dr. Tan Shumo as capital, resulting in his inability to repay the debt. Desperate, Zhang falsely claimed on the morning of the day before yesterday that he needed to return to Cheng for a trip. He then obtained 3,000 yuan in outstanding funds for circulation from the Fuyuan Money Shop and a cash draft of 3,000 yuan from the Fuyu Money Shop (according to this silver draft, there were no proper procedures or evidence, relying entirely on the credit of the runners, but it had to be cleared on the same day). He then used 1,000 yuan to repay the debt to Tan, and fled with the remaining 5,000 yuan, disappearing without a trace. It was not until around 6:00 PM, when Fuyu sought to recover the 3,000 yuan silver draft, that the theft was discovered. Detectives were sent out, but there was no trace of him. With the 3,000 yuan at stake, Fuyu Zhuang requested the Money Industry Association to convene a meeting of the trade at around 7:00 PM. The result of the discussion was that the Ruichangrun Money Shop would find Zhang within a week before further action would be considered.</p>

<p>A boat sailing from Wuyi to Guanxing Heqiao Town set off on the evening of the 27th. At around 10:00 PM, while passing through the Shiwudongqiao area on the border of Changyi, it suddenly encountered seven or eight robbers who ordered the boat to stop with weapons. They jumped onto the boat and looted at will. At that time, one of the boatmen took the opportunity to escape to the Wantazhen in the seventh district of the county and reported to the business group. The group immediately assembled, armed with guns, and rushed to capture the robbers. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robbers fled with their loot. After the incident, it was found that silver coins and goods worth more than one hundred yuan had been stolen, and the passengers had been greatly frightened. In addition, the home of Xu Linbao in Sanjingtou, Tangqiao Township, the first district, had been robbed on the night of the 29th of last month. At around 10:00 PM on the night of the 27th of this month, armed robbers suddenly broke down the door and broke into the house to loot. On the 28th, the township office reported to the county government, requesting a strict investigation of the stolen goods and the arrest of the robbers for punishment according to law.</p>

<p>Chairman Chen of the provincial government, noting that all provincial government staff have diligently performed their duties with unity of purpose and dedication over the past two years since his appointment, and as the performance evaluation period has arrived, has specially recognized and commended those with superior performance or exceptional diligence in accordance with the provincial government's performance evaluation rules, meeting the requirements of Article 1, Paragraph 2, and Article 4, Paragraph 1, and Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the same rules. The names of the commended personnel are as follows: Secretary Yao Yuanchu, Section Chief Wan Junmo, Inspection Commissioner Zhao Lie, Chen Jitang, Chen Zhuosheng, Cheng Ruisun, Chief Clerk Hu Jitong, Wang Jianhong, Wang Sizhuan, Clerk Yao Mingchu, Chen Runfu, Tao Minyuan, Zhou Weichang, Chen Xilian, Yan Ziteng, Zhang Zichun, Zhao Deren, Wen Zongjian, Han Shugan, Secretary He Zhongxiao, Section Chief Li Yizhong, Director of the Inspection Office Jin Hesheng, and Legal Review Committee Member Xu Zhennan.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>Your newspaper's local correspondence on the 27th of this month reported that the former Magistrate of Jingjiang, Li Jinfang, had personnel remaining in the county to handle handover matters who refused to cooperate, and also stated that the magistrate had privately deposited tax funds to earn interest, that the malfeasance had been discovered, and that the personnel remaining in the county were being held under guard by the county government, etc. On the day the report appeared, Jinfang happened to be in the provincial capital, and inquiries with the government office and other departments revealed that no order had been issued to have the newly appointed officials guard the personnel handling the handover matters. The handover had already been completed, and he had already left Jingjiang for Wuxi. Furthermore, since the establishment of the new accounting system in Jiangsu, all taxes have been registered daily by an accounting director dispatched by the Finance Department, and current funds are all deposited in the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank, which acts as the agent treasury. All interest earned is listed as legitimate government revenue. The idea of a county magistrate privately depositing tax funds to earn interest is, under the Jiangsu system, simply impossible in any county. Therefore, it is unnecessary for Jinfang alone to expend effort in self-defense. We respectfully request that you publish this letter of correction to inform those who are unaware.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Li Pufang, Former Magistrate of Jingjiang</p>
<p>October 29th,</p>
<p>To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao</p>

<p>Chairman Lin returned to Shanghai from Fujian the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, around 8:30 AM, he went to the Sino-Western Sanatorium for a physical examination. He then returned to his private residence on Rue Père Huc for rest. In the afternoon, around 4:00 PM, he went out to visit friends and did not return to his residence for dinner until around 6:00 PM. He also received Central Committee members Dai Kuisheng and Jin Liren, the former Director of the Municipal Land Bureau. He is scheduled to take the early train to Beijing this morning at 8:00 AM to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Today is the Difficult End of October: Banks and Money Shops are Busy Settling Accounts; Commercial and Industrial Enterprises Expected to Weather the Storm <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The long-term credit extended by banks and money shops is due at the end of October. To support commerce and industry, special accommodations are being made for maturing long-term loans, with interest settlement extended to the end of April. However, both banks and money shops are particularly busy settling accounts. Yesterday, the exchange rate for silver dollars in the money market was 1.70 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions, an increase of 0.02 yuan from the previous day. However, the "jiatou jia shui" (premium on silver coins), suddenly surged to a peak of 0.70 yuan yesterday, a significant increase of 0.50 yuan from the previous day, the highest since the end of April. This is because the sudden increase in money shops' remittances to banks caused an imbalance between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Extension of Interest Settlement Fully Completed: Long-term credit loans extended by Shanghai banks, money shops, and Ningbo-Hankou money shops in Shanghai are all due today. Although commercial and industrial enterprises that borrowed had already contacted banks and money shops to negotiate interest settlement and extensions until the end of April, both industries made special accommodations to support commerce and industry, and most of the extension procedures have been completed. However, several more were completed yesterday. As for new long-term loans, they are much lower than last year, but by last night, everything had been fully completed.</p>
<p>All Industries Safely Passed Yesterday: Although the difficulty of the end of October is not as great as when closing the books for the year, it is similar to the end of April. Fortunately, after the Ministry of Finance provided relief to the money shops and the banks and money shops cooperated fully, no unfortunate incidents occurred. As for the long-term credit of commercial and industrial enterprises, thanks to the banks and money shops agreeing to extensions and the commodity loan relief provided by the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee, no major factories, firms, or companies were forced to suspend operations yesterday due to a lack of funds. As for the closure of businesses like Yongda Shoe Store on Guangdong Road, they were unrelated to the end of October.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Shipping Companies Request the Issuance of Public Bonds; Rejected Three Times by the Ministry; Approval to Waive Tonnage Dues for Suspended Vessels, but Not to Abolish the School Surtax; Shipping Companies Hope for the Early Announcement of a Reorganization Plan <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng She, the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association's request to issue shipping industry public bonds and abolish the 30% surtax on tonnage dues have both been rejected. Shipping companies are in extreme decline, with as many as 40 vessels suspended. They hope for the early announcement of a reorganization plan to relieve the shipping crisis. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shipping Industry Public Bonds Rejected Three Times</p>
<p>Shipping companies submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications in 1930 to issue 10 million yuan in shipping industry public bonds, but it has never been realized. In July of this year, the Shipping Industry Association, recognizing the increasingly severe decline of the shipping industry, the financial constraints, and the difficulty of maintaining operations, had no choice but to resubmit the old proposal, appealing to the government to quickly issue public bonds to provide relief. After deliberation by the Ministries of Finance and Communications, it was rejected twice due to the lack of a guaranteed fund. The Shipping Industry Association submitted a third request, proposing to designate the surplus tonnage dues as the fund and again requesting approval for the issuance. The Ministry of Communications has again issued a rejection, stating that the tonnage dues have already been incorporated into the national budget and the request cannot be approved, and instructing all shipping companies to be informed.</p>
<p>Exemption from Tonnage Dues for Suspended Vessels Approved</p>
<p>The Shipping Industry Association, due to vessels being suspended without business and therefore having no income, had requested the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department and the Finance Ministry Customs Administration to approve an exemption from tonnage dues, which has been approved. Recognizing that they have been paying a 30% tonnage duty surtax for naval academy funding for six years and the accumulated amount is substantial, and that the shipping industry is now in decline and in dire straits, unable to even sustain itself, they specifically requested the Ministry of Communications to approve a suspension of the levy, which has been rejected.</p>
<p>Hoping for the Announcement of the Reorganization Plan</p>
<p>The decline of the shipping industry has reached an extreme point. As many as 40 vessels are docked in the Huangpu River without cargo to load. The shipping companies' requests to issue public bonds and suspend the 30% surtax on tonnage dues have both been rejected. Their only hope at present is for the Ministry of Communications to quickly announce the proposed reorganization plan for national shipping administration, so that vessels that have been suspended without funds to operate, such as the Daxing Company's Daxing and Hongxing vessels, can resume operations. Various shipping companies have inquired with the industry association, asking them to forward inquiries to the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Successful Pledge of Telegraph and Postal Administration Bonds; Contract Negotiations Commence; China Communications Bank and Other Banks to Undertake the Loan and Form a Syndicate to Handle a Total of 6 Million Yuan with Interest Around 8 Percent <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Communications issued 10 million yuan in Telegraph and Postal Administration bonds, it dispatched Section Chief Zhou Youduan to jointly consult with Post Office Remittance Bureau Director Shen Shuyu and Deputy Director Zhou Shouliang, and various banks, regarding pledge matters. The specific methods have been agreed upon, and contract negotiations commenced yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Methods Agreed Upon: The Telegraph and Postal Administration Bonds are being pledged to Shanghai banks. Shen Shuyu, Zhou Shouliang, and Zhou Youduan consulted with managers from various banks, such as Song Hanzhang, Tang Shoumin, Hu Bijang, Ye Fuxiao, Chen Zheqing, Song Ziliang, Qu Jigang, Wang Boyuan, Chen Guangfu, Wu Yunzhai, etc. on the concrete measures. The specific methods have been agreed upon. The lending banks are Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Jincheng Bank, Continental Bank, China &amp; South Sea Bank, Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Products Bank, Guohua Commercial Bank, and Ken Yieh Bank. The Ministry of Communications plans to pledge 6 million yuan. The amount committed by each bank has not yet been fully decided, but it is generally expected to be sufficient.</p>
<p>Contract Negotiations: A Xin Sheng She reporter visited Ministry of Communications Section Chief Zhou Youduan last night. According to him, the matters concerning the pledge of the Telegraph and Postal Administration Bonds have been largely settled, thanks to Director Shen and Deputy Director Zhou consulting with various banks. The number of subscriptions by the various banks still needs to be finalized. It is expected that banks in Shanghai, such as the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, will all participate in the subscription. The contract has begun to be negotiated and is expected to be formally signed soon. The terms and interest rates will be announced after the contract is signed.</p>
<p>Forming a Syndicate: The lending banks, such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, will form a syndicate to manage the loan after the amount of each bank's commitment has been decided. The total loan amount may reach 6 million yuan. The bonds are secured by international telegraph revenue, making them very reliable. The loan proceeds will be used entirely for the development of telegraph administration. The term of the loan has been rumored to be seven years, but this is not confirmed. The interest rate is approximately 8 percent. In this time of tight credit and economic depression, the success of this loan is no easy feat.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Disaster Relief in Waterlogged Provinces, recognizing the severity of the disasters and the urgent need for relief in the affected provinces, borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Shanghai banking community to facilitate emergency relief. As a result of the banks allocating subscriptions, only 435,000 yuan was actually borrowed, with a stipulation of full repayment within six months. Now that the association has received substantial donations from various sources, it has remitted the money to the Central Bank in two batches to repay the previous advances, totaling 136,000 yuan. It will continue to allocate funds to repay the advances as it receives additional funds.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Wang Qingmu Discusses Diverting the Yellow River; Letter to Chairman Chen of Jiangsu States that Water Management Should Be Conducted Underground <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Dankui, a respected elder of this province, has been concerned about water conservancy issues. Recently, he has repeatedly expressed his views on the Yellow River management problem. He recently sent a letter to Chairman Chen Guofu of Jiangsu Province, discussing the merits and demerits of diverting the Yellow River water in northern Jiangsu. The following is an excerpt from the original letter: "The Yellow River flows south, and northern Jiangsu has suffered severe disasters. Once it reaches the territory of Haishu, it is essential to ensure smooth discharge. Recently, reports stated that the channel of the Burning Incense River, which is the mouth of the river, is still slowly draining, despite being dredged. Further, reports from Xuzhou stated that two river mouths of the Burning Incense River in the eastern irrigation districts have been widened to ten zhang and deepened to six chi. According to the above two reports, the dredging of the Burning Incense River has only reached a depth of six chi, and the portion outside of the mouth cannot be improved by human effort, and the silting up condition is easily imagined. Last year, the opening of the Liu Tang estuary also did not consider the interior and exterior of the river mouth, so it also lacks smooth discharge, similar to the Burning Incense River. These coastal river mouths are shallow. There might be blocking sandbars. It is not possible to have a smooth inner flow into the sea without dredging by machine ship. Furthermore, there are two tides every twenty-four hours. The incoming tide takes about ten hours and the outgoing tide about fourteen hours. When the tide comes in, the river water is stopped by the tide and the silting beneath, which becomes a backflow. Every day, there will be ten hours when the river water cannot flow out. If the river mouth interior and exterior are dredged to at least twelve chi deep, the deeper the better, the water will flow smoothly during low tide. Even at high tide, the upper level will still be pushed and the lower level will not be silted, but there will be pressure, which will drive the water out faster. Water can flow smoothly for twenty-four hours and it would be different from the current sluggish situation. All of the sea estuaries should be deeply dredged and the Huai River outlet opened up at the Taizikou. Then all of the flooding in Su Lu area can be gone without waiting for the completion of the Huai River plan. Dredging the machine ship in Shanghai's Dredging Bureau has proven to be effective. It should request the central authority to borrow and all the costs should be considered as proper spending by the Dredging Fund and reimbursed accordingly. Guiding the Huai River and dredging should assist each other. Regarding the silt conditions of the estuaries, the Maritime Survey Bureau should investigate and draw charts for use. More over, water should be guided underground and should not cause harm but be helpful. Yu the Great diverted the water to the sea. Now, tens of thousands of people are working on the Guiding the Huai project. Yu also used the method of water flowing through large rivers. The Book of History mentioned dredging the fields, and the Analects mentioned trying to dredge the ditches. The ditches are water channels on the farmland. Yu made plans for the people to work on it. Therefore, there were small rivers aside from the sea that water can go to, but not entirely the sea. The Yellow River now goes south and flows on the ground and defenses are built on the ground. In western Lu and northern Su, the ditches have not been restored for a long time. If it is flooded, it will be water everywhere and if it is dry, the ground will be red. When managing water, we should start with the ancient books. The ditches should follow the intent, but not the exact method. We should dredge the ditches to fit local conditions and make the small rivers flow underground. The authorities must do this. For the unflooded areas, we should plan and dredge so that the water can run into the small rivers, and when the flooded area retreats, we should dredge the ground to let people understand the value of water. Wang Qingmu, October 20, year 24."</p>

<p>The fundraising division of the Sino-Foreign Relief Fund at 505 Henan Road, has been raising funds for disaster relief for the Jianghuai River water disasters, and people from all walks of life at home and abroad, as well as overseas Chinese, have donated generously in cash, clothing, and other items. It is reported that the fund has received more than 104,500 yuan in donations in the past three months. Recently, a Westerner (who requested anonymity) donated 750 yuan in Chinese currency. Furthermore, the Chinese crew members of President Hoover's ship, recognizing the severity of this year's water disasters in China, organized a National Day Commemorative Committee to raise funds for relief. The crew members enthusiastically donated a total of 131 US dollars, equivalent to 375.97 yuan in Chinese currency, 1.50 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to 3 yuan in Chinese currency, and 16 yuan in Chinese currency, which was forwarded to the fund by Mr. Yan Kuanrong. In addition, the Ying Public Hall on Baker Road donated five large bundles of cotton clothing, totaling 184 pieces. A frugal saver has withdrawn their savings and specifically purchased 140 cotton quilts to donate to the fund for distribution to disaster areas. The above-mentioned donors are truly dedicated to disaster relief, which is immeasurable. There are countless other donations of clothing, shoes, socks, and medicines, demonstrating that the spirit of benevolence is shared by all. It is reported that the donated goods received by the fund are being continuously transported to disaster areas for distribution.</p>

<p>The SS Scharnhorst, the new ship on the Far East express service of the North German Lloyd shipping company, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on November 7 on its second voyage from Europe. Because it did not visit Japan on its first voyage to the Far East, it will sail to Japan after unloading cargo in Shanghai. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Europe on November 20. Cheng Tianfang, the first Chinese Ambassador to Germany, and his entourage of eleven people, have booked first-class cabins on the ship and are scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the ship on the 20th of next month to take up his new post in Germany. However, since the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian War, warships have gathered in the Mediterranean, and since the League of Nations imposed economic sanctions on Italy, it is feared that the ship may encounter unexpected problems upon reaching Italy. Therefore, the SS Scharnhorst has decided not to go to Genoa this time, but to sail directly to Marseilles, France, which will take only 24 days.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Registered Opium Smokers to Reach 20,000; Voluntary Registration Ends Today; Compulsory Self-Reporting for Amnesty Still Under Consideration; Temporary Opium Addiction Treatment Hospital to Start Preparations Immediately; Compulsory Registration Starts Tomorrow <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports: Opium smoker registration in this city, which started on July 1st and was extended to today as the deadline, has seen a total of 18,199 registrations. Compulsory registration will begin tomorrow, with the implementation of arrests and fines for opium offenders. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e108">Registered Opium Smokers to Reach 20,000 <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Since the Public Safety Bureau (PSB) began opium smoker registration on July 1st, a total of 18,199 opium smokers have registered as of yesterday. Among them, 6,888 have obtained ordinary addiction treatment licenses, 8,479 have obtained licenses for the impoverished, totaling 15,167 license holders. 1,384 are undergoing addiction treatment, and 1,448 have registered for treatment but have not yet been sent to hospitals. In total, 18,199 opium smokers have registered. The PSB conducted a total of three investigations into opium smokers in this city. All opium smokers found were registered, achieving excellent results. The three opium smoker investigations are scheduled to end today. It is estimated that the number of registered opium smokers will increase by 2,000 to 3,000 today, quickly bringing the total number of registered opium smokers to around 20,000.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Self-Reporting for Amnesty Under Serious Consideration <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The PSB will cease voluntary opium smoker registration from tomorrow and will begin arresting opium offenders, imposing fines ranging from 50 to 300 yuan, and sending them to addiction treatment hospitals for compulsory detoxification. All PSB branch bureaus and teams are required to submit arrest reports to the bureau within three hours of detaining opium smokers. Any unauthorized punishment or delayed submission will be severely punished without leniency upon investigation. However, the PSB recognizes that the city is vast, and it was inevitable that some opium smokers would be missed during the voluntary registration period. Whether to grant amnesty from fines to opium smokers who self-report during the compulsory registration period is currently under serious consideration, but a decision will be made within days.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Opium Addiction Treatment Hospital to Start Preparations Immediately <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The PSB anticipates that during the compulsory registration period, the number of arrested opium offenders who cannot afford to pay fines or obtain licenses will be high, and they will have to be sent to the city's addiction treatment hospitals for compulsory detoxification. However, the city's addiction treatment hospitals can only accommodate a maximum of 20 to 30 people per day. If this number is exceeded, the hospitals in both the Shanghai South and Shanghai North districts will not be able to accommodate them immediately. The PSB detention center can only hold a maximum of 300 opium offenders, and if the number increases, it will be impossible to detain them. Therefore, a request was submitted to the municipal government to order the Health Bureau to prepare a temporary addiction treatment hospital with a capacity of 500 people to accommodate the opium offenders undergoing compulsory detoxification during the compulsory registration period. Yesterday, the bureau received a reply from the municipal government, ordering the bureau to jointly prepare the establishment of this temporary addiction treatment hospital with the Health Bureau immediately. Before the addiction treatment hospital is established, the PSB will consult with the local court to temporarily borrow a portion of the Caohejing Prison to house the opium offenders temporarily detained by the PSB. Once the addiction treatment hospital has available rooms and beds, they will be transferred separately for treatment. The PSB also noted that the food expenses for all temporarily detained prisoners are considerable. The previously approved monthly food budget of 300 yuan is insufficient. Therefore, the bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government for approval to allow actual reporting and reimbursement of expenses during the compulsory registration period, without being restricted by the original budget.</p>

<p>The PSB also announced that during the compulsory registration period, to encourage citizens to report unlicensed opium smokers, in accordance with Article 4 of the "Measures for Handling Registration of Opium Smoking Households within a Time Limit," 30% of the fines will be awarded to informants. Those who make false accusations will be punished according to the law. The bureau is currently drafting measures for the registration, reward, and punishment of informants.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Transfer of Cadres and Police to Assist in Security and Guard Duties <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>During the compulsory registration period, there will be many opium offenders and procedures will be particularly cumbersome. The procedures for opium smokers undergoing addiction treatment or obtaining licenses for the impoverished, including finding guarantors and verifying guarantor information, will be particularly complicated. The current number of police officers is insufficient to handle the workload. Therefore, the PSB has temporarily transferred two squads of police officers from the Police Headquarters to assist in security and guard duties.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Working Day and Night to Handle Opium Cases <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>After completing the opium smoker registration procedures, filling out the application form, and paying the license fee, the PSB will first issue a temporary receipt and then issue the official license at a later date. Therefore, there is a significant time difference between the registration and the issuance of the license. During the voluntary registration period, opium smokers applied for addiction treatment licenses voluntarily, so a slight delay in the issuance date was not a problem. However, starting in November, all opium smokers who are caught will be subject to compulsory registration. If a temporary receipt is issued first and then the license is issued at a later date, the procedure will be overly complicated, and after a certain period of time, many opium smokers will hide or flee, and many addiction treatment licenses will not be delivered. Therefore, the PSB will change its approach during the compulsory registration period, registering and issuing licenses simultaneously. Opium offenders will be released after obtaining their addiction treatment licenses. The PSB will assign several officials to handle the registration and license issuance procedures for interrogated opium offenders to avoid backlog and streamline the process. The PSB will handle all opium cases sent by the branch bureaus day and night during the first month of compulsory registration, regardless of the time of day.</p>

<p>The Southeast Joint Office of the World Red Swastika Society has been working extremely hard to handle disaster relief efforts for the Yangtze River floods. It has paid particular attention to the floods in various parts of Northern Jiangsu. When the dikes in Xuzhou collapsed, it remitted relief funds to the local Red Swastika Society to handle emergency relief. However, the disaster area is vast, and all counties under Hai Prefecture have been flooded, with Suqian and Shuyang suffering the most severe damage. A small amount of relief funds is not enough to help. The office has convened a board of supervisors, invited Mr. Cai Qu, president of the Wuxi branch, Mr. Huang Nanrun, supervisor of the Jiangbei office, and Mr. Ling Yuanlang, president of the Zhenjiang branch, to Shanghai to discuss measures. It was decided to send a circular to all Southeast branches to continue fundraising and publicly appoint Mr. Han Zishi, general supervisor of the Jiangbei office, to lead the effort. At the same time, President Dai Jitao specifically donated 1,000 yuan, designated for the Hai-Shu disaster area. The Society headquarters also remitted 1,000 yuan, and the Jiangbei office raised 2,000 yuan. Efforts are underway in Shanghai and Wuxi to raise funds. It is reported that the office has received a telegram from the Xuzhou Red Swastika Society stating that relief specialists Chen Wangqiu, Zhu Jing, Tang Gaojun, Liu Foyuan, and Zhang Huaide have arrived in Xuzhou one after another. Chen and Zhu, along with Captain Xu Mingzhi of the Xuzhou detachment, have departed for Pizhou and Suqian to inspect the disaster areas. Tang has gone to Pei County for investigation, and Zhang and Liu have gone to the Hai-Shu area for inspection. It is also reported that Society President Xiong Xiling has sent a special letter to Han Zishi via Yu Lushi, requesting him to personally contact Hai'an to promote the effort.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Ministry of Industry to Build New Fish Market; Opening in Mid-December; All Engineering Completed Long Ago; Fish Merchants' Opposition Resolved <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, in order to revitalize China's fishing industry, has specially planned to build a large-scale fish market north of Dinghai Bridge in Yangshupu, covering an area of over 50 mu, with a capital of 1 million yuan in national currency. All engineering projects have been completed one after another, and the internal equipment is now being painstakingly arranged. It is expected to formally open in mid-December. At that time, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo will personally come to Shanghai to preside over the opening. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Main Structures <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The main structures of the market are divided into: A. An office building with seven floors. Floors two to four will house the technology room, library, board room, conference room, aquatic product exhibition room, dining hall, and staff bedrooms. Floors five to seven will have a radio room, meteorological observation station, and meteorological signal station. B. A sales floor, covering an area of 6,323 square feet. C. Temporary warehouses, totaling six, each 42 feet long, 25 feet wide, and 14 feet high. D. Floating docks, totaling three, connected by iron chains, with a total length of 600 feet, capable of simultaneously docking two trawlers, two hand-operated net boats, and 24 live fish boats. E. Broker offices, totaling 28 offices. F. A cold storage facility with five cold storage rooms, one ice-making room, one freezing room, and one machine room, etc., contracted by the Xin Hengtai Construction Company. Construction began in July of this year, and all engineering projects have been completed one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Cooperative Efforts <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The market was originally planned to be jointly operated by the government and merchants. However, local fish merchants believed that the establishment of the market was a prelude to the control of the fishing industry, which would affect their own interests and survival. There was a misunderstanding, so they did not join as merchant shareholders. Although it has now been changed to be wholly state-owned by the Ministry of Industry, the position of broker is intended to be filled by fish merchants. The fish merchants also stated that the total amount of loans given to fishermen over the years has reached more than 2.5 million, averaging about 70,000 yuan per household. If they lose their original position and become brokers in the fish market, this "fish loan" will be uncollectible. Furthermore, according to recent statistics, the total annual trade value of Shanghai fish products averages about 20 million yuan. The commission is 8% of the value, according to precedent, with a total annual income of 1.6 million yuan. The fish market stipulates that the commission is only 6% of the value, and the brokers split the commission with the market in a 5:3 ratio. The net commission income of the fish market is about 700,000 yuan per year, and the fish merchants' income is only 480,000 yuan, a reduction of more than three times the original income. The average annual income per household is only 10,000 yuan, so they are unwilling to join as brokers. Although they have been persuaded several times, the two sides still insist. However, the market believes that the situation is irreversible and cannot be ruined because the fish merchants refuse to serve as brokers. It has now been decided to take decisive action and recruit new people to handle the matter. The fish merchants then became alarmed again and expressed their willingness to accept. The market side did not refuse to accept, and other methods will be sought to resolve all of the above difficulties. The market has now prepared the regulations for fisherman loans, fishery regulations, market organizational law, broker rules, etc., and submitted them to the Ministry for approval and publication. The formal opening date will be held in mid-December. Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo is determined to come to Shanghai personally to preside over the opening.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Market Advantages <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>After the market formally opens, its advantages in terms of economics are: (1) It can balance supply and demand according to market needs, avoiding the evils of price surges and falls, and fish owners can avoid being affected by cheap fish; (2) In addition to paying the appropriate commission, other fees can be waived; (3) Centralized operations require fewer personnel and save expenses, and can also avoid the evils of monopolies and manipulation by a few people; (4) It can level market prices, so that fishermen are not affected by the sharp decline in fish prices, and with the support of financial institutions, the economy can circulate. In terms of facilities: (1) There is a 600-foot long embankment, docks, and warehouses, with quick and convenient loading and unloading; (2) The area is large, and there is plenty of open space around, so market transactions are not crowded or noisy; (3) Market facilities are designed by experts, using scientific methods, and special attention is paid to ventilation, light, and washing, so that the market has no fishy smell and is hygienic; (4) There is a 1,500-ton cold storage facility, with a cold storage capacity of 22,000 dan, so that fish can be stored and sold when needed in the market; (5) There are refrigerated trucks and refrigerated ships, which can transport fresh fish to various places at any time to promote consumption; (6) There is a meteorological station and a radio station, which can report the weather and the supply and demand of fish in various places, as well as the news of fish prices, so that practitioners can have a basis for making decisions; (7) There is a purchasing cooperative, and all fishers can become members to enjoy affordable and high-quality fishing gear and ship supplies; (8) It can act as an agent for fishing boat fees, customs declarations, and other matters. In short, the future formal opening will be of great benefit to controlling the fishing industry economy, developing the future of the fishing industry, and reducing the burden on fishermen.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Continued News of the Postal Bureau's Robbery Case; Chen Qiu and Two Others Await Sentencing; Trial for Monk Wukong and Eight Others to Be Continued <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of September 9th, the Shanghai Postal Bureau was robbed of over 91,000 yuan in large denomination bills while delivering the funds to the Guojin Remittance Bureau. The escorts, Rui Lin and Yuan Bingshu, were shot and killed by the armed robbers. Another escort, Zhou Yuchen, was also shot and injured. Afterwards, the Detectives of Dixwell Road Police Station arrested several suspects. After the investigation was concluded, those who were not involved were released one after another, while the remaining ten men and women, including the monk Wukong (secular name Ji Rentang) from Jiangbei, were prosecuted by the police station according to law. The First Special District Local Court has repeatedly conducted inquiries and reported on the situation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the court again, summoned witnesses, and ordered the eleven men and women defendants, including the monk Wukong, Qiu Guobin, Li Yisheng, Li Xueshi, Wu Pangui, Zhou Yaoshi (also known as Zhou Ermazi), Dao Sheng, Ji Wenbin, Ji Chen, Chen Qiu, and Ji Chen to be tried. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that Ji Rentang, also known as the monk Wukong, had confessed to the police station a few days ago, and that the two defendants, Qiu Guobin and Wu Pangui, could prove the circumstances of the confession at the time. However, the detectives sent to Funing to apprehend the wanted criminal had returned empty-handed, saying that the criminal had fled after hearing the news. Detective No. 296 of the Dixwell Road Police Station reported that when they went to Funing to arrest the suspect, the suspect's entire family had already fled. Qiu Guobin and Wu Pangui testified that Ji Rentang confessed to the police station that he had conspired with Liu Xiaojiaozi and six others to rob the postal bureau, and that Ji had admitted that he was the one who carried the bag containing the banknotes. They both heard Ji's confession. Wang Kan of the Postal Bureau testified that when the bandits fired their guns, he was working in the office and saw three shots fired through the window. The bandit who fired the gun looked like Ji Rentang, but his face was slightly fuller. The court then questioned Ji, who said that the confession at the police station was not his true intention. Qiu and Wu both said that there was no torture at the time, but Ji continued to deny it and requested that the judge examine his body. Then Qiu Guobin said that the black long gown that Ji wore when he went to rob the postal bureau was borrowed from him, and now there is a hole in the right side of the gown, which was made by Ji holding a pistol and firing it from inside the gown.</p>
<p>The Hole Was Made by a Bullet</p>
<p>The court then questioned the defendant Chen Qiu, who testified that Qiu Guobin was her younger brother. The detectives searched her and found 213 yuan in cash, which was the money she earned from participating in a rotating credit association and the money saved by her husband and son over time, and it was not given to her by Guobin. Guobin also testified that although he received 350 yuan, he had used it to buy gold rings, cloth, and pay off debts, and did not give a single cent to his sister. The defendant Wu Pangui still denied going to Wang Chen's house to participate in the conspiracy to rob the postal bureau with monk Wukong, Liu Xiaojiaozi, etc., saying that he had been a police officer in Shanghai for many years, and how dare he do such an illegal thing, and asked for a thorough investigation. But the defendant Ji Chen insisted that she saw Wu Pangui and Wukong secretly talking in the inner room on the third floor of Wang Chen's house, and she had also seen them gathering in a nearby teahouse once. However, she did not hear what they were talking about because they stopped talking as soon as they saw her. The defendant Zhou Yaoshi also denied going to Wang Chen's house to conspire with Wukong, etc. on the opium bed and dividing 110 yuan of the stolen money after the robbery. However, according to Qiu Guobin, he did see Zhou and Wukong smoking opium in the same bed, and he also heard Wukong confess at the police station that he had given Zhou 150 yuan. Zhou also admitted to receiving the money at the time. The court then questioned Wang Chen, who testified that Zhou had two meetings with Liu Xiaojiaozi, Wukong, etc. at her house. Xiaojiaozi asked him how to proceed with the postal bureau robbery, and Zhou replied that he would wait for Wang to arrive before making a decision. But Zhou still denied all of the above statements.</p>
<p>Stubbornly Denying Everything</p>
<p>Later, the court questioned the defendant Liu Daosheng, who testified that he was framed by Ji Wenbin, who had a grudge against him. He said that he was unemployed and stayed at the home of a man named Liang in Funing to work as a cook. The robbery was planned at Liang's house in the fifth or sixth month of the year. It was not until a man surnamed Chen brought a box of pistols from Jiangbei that he knew that the target was the postal bureau. He asked everyone how they would rob the postal bureau, but they did not tell him their plans afterwards. On the afternoon of August 8th, a man surnamed Wang led them out of Liang's house, and Liu Daosheng went with them. Since then, everyone has not returned. Liang's residence was originally a thatched hut, and after getting the stolen money, they abandoned the thatched hut. Later, he heard a man surnamed Chen from the gang say that Liang received more than 30,000 yuan of the stolen money, but he did not get a single cent. Until October 17th, he suddenly met Liu Daosheng and reported it to the police station. He did not know Wukong, etc. The court verified the confession, and since the investigations of Chen Qiu, Li Yisheng, and Wu Pangui were largely clear, the court ordered a preliminary debate on the accusations against these three people. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu spoke first, stating that Chen Qiu was a poor woman, so where did she get so much cash, which was obviously the stolen money obtained by her brother, and she should be punished for the crime of</p>
<p>Receiving Stolen Goods</p>
<p>As for Li Yisheng, who was a ship's steward, he embezzled 1,000 yuan of stolen money hidden in the pillow by Wang Chen, so he should be charged with the crime of embezzlement in the course of business. Wu Pangui participated in the bandits' conspiracy and was in fact an instigator of the robbery, and he should be punished according to the law. The court, as Wu did not have a designated lawyer, designated Yang Huchen, the defending lawyer for Chen Qiu, to defend Wu Pangui as well. Li Yisheng was defended by his appointed lawyer, Li Zhongwen. After the arguments were made, Judge Jiang ruled that the sentences for the three defendants would be announced next Wednesday. The trial for monk Wukong and the other eight would be continued next Wednesday afternoon. The police took the eleven men and women back to the detention center separately.</p>

<p>Huaye Building, located at No. 173, Lane 159, Seymour Road, is an apartment building used by Chinese and foreign middle and upper class people. Because of its quiet location, it is home to many residents. However, at 6:15 last night, several gunshots suddenly rang out from Room 44 on the fourth floor of the building. At that time, the building staff were about to leave work for the day when they suddenly heard the shots. They stopped and ran to investigate. They found that the door to the room was closed but not locked. They pushed it open and were shocked to see a young British man shot and lying on the ground, and an elderly British man holding a handgun lying at the door. Both were still warm to the touch and had gunshot wounds. The two were covered in blood, a gruesome sight that sent chills down one's spine. The building staff did not have time to consider the circumstances and immediately telephoned the police station to send an ambulance to rush the two to Hongen Hospital for treatment. En route, the elderly Briton died. His body was sent to the coroner's office and the British Assessor's Office to investigate the truth.</p>

Therefore, a special shareholders meeting was convened to pass a liquidation resolution and hire accountants and liquidators to handle the closing. It is reported that the company is able to pay off all creditors, but it is not yet possible to predict how much of the equity will be paid back.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Hu Renfu Commits Suicide by Drowning; British Consul-General Sends Letter and Belongings <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Letter: Deceived by Others, Drifting to a Foreign Land</p>
<p>Content: Conscience-Stricken, Ashamed to Live On</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month at 9 PM, the British merchant ship "Lishan" was passing outside Yantai Harbor when a man named Hu Renfu suddenly jumped into the sea and drowned. Rescue attempts were unsuccessful. He left behind a letter and belongings, which the shipowner requested the British Consul-General to forward to the Shanghai Municipal Government, seeking his family members to claim them. It is now learned that the Consul-General's letter and a list of Hu Renfu's belongings are as follows:</p>
<p>British Consul-General's Letter: According to the report of the owner of the British merchant ship "Lishan," a Chinese passenger claiming to be named Hu Renfu jumped overboard at 9:30 PM on October 10th this year, when the ship was 15 English miles outside Yantai Harbor, on its way to Tianjin. This act was witnessed by a Russian shipping police officer on board, who immediately raised an alarm. The ship stopped immediately and launched a lifeboat. Despite a thorough search at sea, no trace of the person was found. Among the items left behind were a watch, four yuan and some cents in banknotes, and a suicide note from Hu Renfu. The note indicated that he committed suicide. Hu Renfu boarded the ship in Yantai, apparently heading to Tianjin. His address is unknown, but his accent suggests he was from Shanghai. The Consul-General is now forwarding his belongings and the letter to your Worship the Mayor, and respectfully requests that your Worship investigate the above circumstances and take appropriate action. Addressed to Shanghai Mayor Wu. From John B. Affleck, British Consul-General in Shanghai, October 21st.</p>
<p>Content of the Suicide Note: Hu's suicide note reads as follows: "I drifted to a foreign land, deceived by others. My conscience reproaches me, and I am ashamed to live on. I hereby take this opportunity to find my final resting place. I deeply apologize to the shop owner. The remaining fifteen yuan and clothing can be used for the cost of a coffin. I would be grateful and thankful if the Public Security Bureau could assist with this matter." Signed, Hu Renfu, night of October 9th.</p>
<p>List of Belongings: The belongings left by Hu included a suitcase, a hat, a watch, a cotton quilt, four books, a sleeveless undershirt, a shirt, a collar, and four yuan and one cent in silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Mother and Daughter Both Abducted and Sold; Mother Escapes but Daughter's Whereabouts Unknown; Ma Yongbiao and Others Await Sentencing <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Tangshi, a woman from Shaoxing, aged thirty-eight, reported to the Huisi Police Station the night before last that Ma Yongbiao (also known as "Little Shaoxing"), residing at No. 192, North Xizang Road, had tricked and abducted her and her eleven-year-old daughter, Zhao Aju, a month ago, and had them taken to Shandong to be sold. The money was used up. Now, having been rescued, she arrived in Shanghai at noon today. Her daughter's whereabouts are still unknown. She requested an investigation. The police station dispatched Chinese detectives Shen Dehui and Bao Ziduo, who arrested Ma Yongbiao. They also went to No. 87, Lane 302, Haifang Road, West Shanghai, and apprehended an accomplice from Anhui, Geng Huaixin (also known as "Old Man Geng"), and brought them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 298 of the Criminal Law regarding the crime of abduction. According to the informant Zhao Tangshi, she and the defendant Ma Yongbiao were from the same village and were distantly related. In the eighth month of the lunar calendar this year, she met Ma on Qipu Road. During their conversation, she mentioned that she was looking for an employer as a servant. Ma told her that since the war had broken out in Shanghai, the market was bad and wages were very low. It would be better to go to Shandong as a servant, where men could earn twenty yuan a month and women could earn thirty. She believed him and asked him to recommend her. On the Mid-Autumn Festival, she brought her daughter Aju to Ma's house to stay temporarily. A few days later, the second defendant, Geng Huaixin, arrived, and Ma instructed her to go with Geng. She then went to Shandong with Aju and Geng, staying at the home of Geng's friend, Song Shipan, for about twenty days. It wasn't until September 26th that Geng, Song, and others took her to Zhu Yaozeng's house. At that time, she only knew that she was working as a servant for the Zhu family. Later, without any explanation, she was told that Zhu had bought her for two hundred yuan to be his wife and presented a written agreement. Only then did she wake up as if from a dream. She immediately cried and told Zhu about being deceived and asked for help. Zhu also understood the inside story but did not provide assistance. Zhu issued a letter, entrusting the local Red Cross to arrange for her to be sent back to Shanghai. She arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and reported it to the police station. She learned that her daughter Aju had also been sold in Shandong and did not know where she was. She requested a thorough investigation. Ma Yongbiao confessed that he and Zhao Tangshi were from the same village. After meeting her on the road a month ago, she wanted him to sell her daughter Aju for her. So, he asked Geng Huaixin to take her to Shandong to sell her. He did not know that Zhao Tangshi had also been sold. A few days ago, Geng returned to Shanghai and gave him five yuan, which he had already spent. Geng Huaixin also confessed that he took Zhao Tangshi and her daughter to Shandong. Song Shipan found employers to sell them separately. In total, he sold them for one hundred and thirty yuan. After deducting forty yuan for travel expenses and thirty yuan for food, there were sixty yuan left. He gave Ma thirty-five yuan and only used twenty-five yuan himself. After Magistrate Wu Zehan reviewed the confessions, he ordered Ma and Geng to be detained and await sentencing on the morning of the 31st of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e131">A Glimpse of the Abductor's Confession; Transferred to the Public Security Bureau <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Zhabei New Customs Branch had cracked down on nine abductors at around 3 PM the day before yesterday. The following are excerpts from the confessions of the abductors: (1) Jiang Dianfa confessed that he was 45 years old and lived at No. 13, Shenyu Lane, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi. He opened a matchmaking shop with Zhuang Yinggen and Wu Shoufu. Zhuang brought Xiao Tuzi (Li Guisheng) to the shop, which is how he knew him. The Yang Xiaomei incident should be asked of Xiao Tuzi. (2) Li Guisheng claimed to be 35 years old and lived at No. 336, Zhaojia Road, Nanshi. He had only been in Shanghai for twenty days, first living at the Lao Juxing Inn on North Zhejiang Road, Zhabei, for six days, and later living in the matchmaking shop opened by Jiang. At that time, there was a sixteen-year-old girl (Yang Xiaomei) living in Tang Zhiming's room. They conspired with Tang Daishi to tell me to take Yang Xiaomei to Yantai. There was also a twenty-year-old girl, but I didn't know how to take her there. (3) Tang Zhiming confessed that he was 29 years old and lived in room No. 8 of the Lao Juxing Inn. Yang Xiaomei was brought to live with him by a man. After a few days, Tang Daishi took her to Yantai. I didn't participate. (4) Tang Daishi confessed that she was 43 years old and lived in the Lao Juxing Inn. On the 27th or 28th day of the eighth lunar month this year, Yang Zhenkun and three people with the surnames Ren and Wang brought a girl. They set off on the fifth day of the ninth month and arrived in Yantai on the eighth. In Yantai, Ren Zigang, who opened a fried goods shop on Sanwan Street, contacted Song Miao and sold her for 160 yuan. On the twelfth, they returned to Shanghai. (5) Tu Yuqing confessed that he was 33 years old and lived at No. 336, Zhaojia Road. Because Zhuang Yinggen was his cousin, he lived in his house. They said they were taking a girl to Ningbo to be married, and I didn't know anything else. (6) Xu Xingsheng confessed that he was 27 years old and lived in the Lao Juxing Inn. I came to Shanghai to look for my wife. Because I knew Tang Zhiming, I went to his room to play and was arrested together. (7) Tang Baishi confessed that she was 16 years old and lived in the Lao Juxing Inn. I and Tang Zhiming's wife were both nanny's in Daqing Lane. I went to the inn because I was sick and lived with my husband for a few days. I was arrested together. (8) Tang Xiaomei confessed that she was 20 years old and lived in the Lao Juxing Inn. I also lived there with my husband and was brought here by them. (9) Wang Zhifu confessed that he was 28 years old, from Zhenjiang, and lived in the same place. He also said he was wrongly arrested. Except for Wang Zhifu, the other eight people were all from Liyang. The plaintiff's confession was the same as yesterday's newspaper. The case has now been transferred to the Public Security Bureau. After Zhengsheng Hengji Timber Company Was Sold, Wei Shanfu and Others Were Accused; Tian Xiancheng Accuses Wei and Others of Embezzlement and Breach of Trust; The Three Defendants Were Granted Bail After Questioning</p>
<p>Zhengsheng Hengji Timber Company in Rihuigang, Nanshi, was founded by Zhu Yin, a major timber merchant in this port, and Tian Shilin, who has passed away. The business was extensive, with monthly sales of hundreds of thousands of gold. Tian Qian was the general manager and hired Wei Shanfu as the deputy general manager. In 1925, Tian died of illness, and the company affairs were handled by Wei Shanfu and Tian's relatives, Tian Qiyuan and Tian Xiangru. Later, due to losses, the company was sold and renamed Yuji. The company's land, more than ten mu, was also mortgaged due to insufficient funds. Tian Shilin's son, Tian Xiancheng, felt aggrieved that Wei Fanfu and others had not reported anything and handled it on their own. He negotiated with Wei and others without a satisfactory resolution. He then filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Local Court, accusing Wei Shanfu, Tian Qiyuan, and Tian Xiangru of breach of trust and embezzlement of company assets, amounting to a loss of 160,000 taels of silver. If calculated according to the business profits, it would be more than 2 million taels. After the court received the complaint, Inspector Du Jiasheng ordered the plaintiff and defendants to appear in court for separate interrogations on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. After a long time, he ordered the defendants Wei Shanfu, Tian Qiyuan, and Tian Xiangru to be released on bail, pending investigation and verification.</p>

He specifically summoned the persons in charge of each hotel to the meeting and stated that if any hotel allowed smokers to privately sell lamps for smoking opium and gambling, the hotel's license would be revoked and the matter would be investigated. Those who agreed were to sign and implement the measure. The managers unanimously agreed to assist in the prohibition of smoking and signed accordingly before dispersing.</p>

In addition, regarding the proposal submitted by Moore Memorial Church in this city to test shoe shining services on roads and in parks, the Council stated that the proposal had been submitted in 1931 and last year, and had been rejected because it would obstruct pedestrians, hinder traffic, and not be worth the effort. The situation remains the same, and the matter should not be discussed.</p>

<p>Chen Pinshan, a 19-year-old from Ningbo, the owner of the Xingfa Inn at No. 116, Huoshu Mill Street in the French Concession, whose father has passed away, and the inn is managed by his daughter. Chen, through a matchmaker, engaged Zhang Lanqing (18 years old this year), the daughter of Zhang Zi'an, a fellow villager from the Ningkang Inn on Min'guo Road, Old North Gate, as his wife. The parents of both parties, believing that the man and woman had reached marriageable age, chose an auspicious day, the 20th of this month, to marry Zhang Lanqing at the Hongyun Restaurant Auditorium on Min'guo Road, opposite the New North Gate. After the wedding, they rented a room in the second-floor pavilion at No. 1, New Kang Lane (opposite the back door of Xingfa Inn) on Mill Street. Chen Pinshan was lame in one foot. Because it was the beginning of their marriage, the young couple's love was very deep. However, according to the bad customs of Ningbo, there are wedding pranks when marrying a bride, which are strange and varied. As a new bride, Chen Pinshan could not avoid the secular customs after marriage, so the wedding pranks have continued uninterrupted for ten days, causing the bride Chen Zhang Juqing's nerves to be stimulated. Yesterday morning, when her husband Chen Pinshan was not in the room, Chen Zhang Juqing got up for no reason and went under the bed, took out a pair of sharp scissors from the dowry box, and stabbed herself in the throat. After stabbing herself, she still lay under the bed. At nearly five o'clock in the morning, Chen Pinshan returned from outside, pushed open the door and entered the room. Not seeing his wife sleeping on the bed, he called out to her but received no response. He did not have time to search and rushed to inform his mother at the Xingfa Inn he had opened. His mother actually said that the new bride had escaped for no reason. She then sent someone to summon the original matchmaker and the bride's father, Zhang Zi'an. First, there was an argument, and then they rushed to the new room to check. Only then did they find the new bride, Zhang Juqing, still lying under the bed, with one foot stretched out. She was wearing red shoes. They called out to her, but there was no response. They dragged her out and saw that her throat was covered in blood, staining her clothes. Without asking the reason, they hired a car and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported to the Central Police Station, which informed the French Police Station and sent detectives to the hospital to investigate. They learned that although the woman's throat had two holes poked with scissors, fortunately, the trachea was not severed, and she could still speak, but in a very low voice. The detectives asked the reason for the injury, whether she had been stabbed or had committed suicide. She replied that her mind was vague and unclear. The detectives reported the situation to the police chief. It was heard that Zhang's injury was not serious. The doctor stitched up the wound and kept her in the hospital for treatment. She is expected to be discharged safely in a few days.</p>

<p>Ding Jinren, nearly forty years old, a carpenter and the elder brother of Ding Jinrong, a native of Yancheng residing at No. 54, Tan Family Residence, Liyuan Road, Chinese Concession, suddenly suffered from chills and fever on the 20th of last month. He sought treatment from Ling Furen, a doctor from the same village, at No. 191, Rihui East Road, who diagnosed him with damp-heat typhoid fever and prescribed a prescription. Later, Shan Jinrong took the prescription to Hu Nanshan Pharmacy at No. 137, Tei Road, French Concession, to have the medicine prepared. However, Jinren's condition worsened after taking the medicine. Jinrong asked Dr. Ling to come to his home to examine him again and ordered him to take out the original prescription to reconsider and modify it. To his surprise, the prescription that was taken out was not the original prescription that Dr. Ling prescribed, but a prescription for menstruation medicine for a woman surnamed Ding from another doctor, Ni Jinren. He was greatly shocked. After negotiating with the pharmacy without success, Ding Jinrong hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit with the Second Criminal Court, accusing Hu Zhenxian (over 75 years old, from Yuyao), the owner of Hu Nanshan Pharmacy, his apprentice Sun Longshui (18 years old, from Yuyao), and doctor Ling Furen (27 years old, from Yancheng) of professional negligence resulting in injury and death (Note: the patient Ding Jinren has not yet died), and requested an investigation. After receiving the complaint, the court, on the 11th of this month, had Judge Xiong Huiping open the court and summon all parties for questioning, as detailed in this newspaper. The court had already ordered the police to retrieve the prescriptions for the two patients from the pharmacy. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiong opened the court again to continue the hearing. Both parties appeared in court with their lawyers. Patient Ding Jinren was wrapped in a cotton quilt and carried into the courtroom by his brother. Because he could not sit, he lay in the corner of the hearing room behind the audience seats. The court clerk summoned the plaintiff and the defendants to the stand. After briefly questioning their names, the court summoned the witness, another doctor, Ni Jinren. Ni Jinren, residing at No. 158, Dapu Road, stated that on September 11th or 19th, a woman surnamed Ding came to me for medical treatment. The official showed Ni a blue-printed prescription form and asked, "Is this your prescription?" Ni took it and replied, "Yes." The official then took a red-cornered prescription form (the prescription Ling Furen prescribed for Ding Jinren) and asked, "Do you know this prescription?" Ni took it and replied, "I don't know. It's not my prescription." The official asked Ni, "Do you know about this matter?" Ni replied, "I didn't know at first. On the afternoon of September 30th, a detective and someone from the pharmacy came to me to inquire about the woman surnamed Ding who came to see me for treatment and told me to find the group. I only knew that the woman surnamed Ding lived in Yuchang Lane, Caishi Road, but I didn't know the number. I searched but couldn't find her. Later, on October 3rd, I met the family of the woman surnamed Ding on the road and asked them how her condition was after taking the medicine I prescribed. They replied that after taking the medicine, her condition worsened, and she only got better after being treated at the Red Cross Hospital. I then told them about the mistaken prescription and told them to take the prescription to the police station. The police questioned both of us in the police station, said we had nothing to do with the case, and told us to leave. I didn't know what happened after that." Based on Ni's confession, the official ordered him to provide a signed statement and attach it to the file. Patient Ding Jinren was lying in front and could not move. The official then left the stand with the court clerk and went to Ding Jinren's side. The official asked Ding Jinrong to uncover the mattress. Ding Jinren seemed to be asleep. When the quilt was uncovered, he woke up. The official asked his name, age, occupation, and place of origin. He answered with difficulty and stretched out his hand to show his age, but he could not count. The official then asked if he wanted to sue the pharmacy. He shook his head without answering. The official then asked, "Do you not want to sue?" He nodded. The judge, fearing that he did not understand the language, ordered the bailiff to speak to his brother Ding Jin through a translator. Ding Jinren still shook his head in the same way as before, then appeared to be in a comatose state, with his upper body trembling. The official immediately returned to the stand and announced that the case could not be proceeded with for the time being. Defendant Yu Xiufang's lawyer then claimed to the court that he had heard that Ding Jinren only had a mother but no brothers, that they were organized, and requested the court to conduct a detailed investigation. The plaintiff, Ding Jinrong, stated that the defendant had accused him of extortion in the District Court and requested verification. The third defendant, Ling Furen, also stated that they had accused him of organized extortion in the District Court and listed me as the second defendant. Please investigate in detail. The official stated that the case in the District Court was another issue and that you could submit a defense. The second defendant, Longshui, brought two samples of the medicine he had prepared for the patient to present to the court as proof that the medicine was prepared and dispensed according to the prescription. The court ordered that a date be set for another hearing and then adjourned.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government previously believed that hooligans and thugs in the city often stole vehicles and pledged them in pawnshops, especially bicycles, which were most easily stolen. Therefore, the Social Affairs, Public Security, and Public Utilities Bureaus jointly reviewed and approved eight rules for the management of various vehicles pledged in pawnshops. These rules were approved by the Municipal Government a few days ago and are now being announced for implementation this morning. The original text of the rules is as follows: Rules for the Management of Various Vehicles Pledged in Pawnshops: (1) In addition to complying with the rules stipulated in these rules, each pawnshop should also pay attention to the rules for the management of various vehicles promulgated by the Municipal Government. (2) When pledging various private vehicles, the vehicle registration certificate issued by the Public Utilities Bureau must be handed over to the pawnshop for safekeeping. The pawnshop should also verify whether the steel stamp number specified by the Public Utilities Bureau matches the number on the registration certificate before accepting the pledge. (3) When pledging various commercial vehicles, in addition to complying with the conditions listed in the first clause, the pawnshop must also obtain a written statement from the vehicle company before accepting the pledge. (4) If a pawnshop has any doubts about a pledged vehicle, it should submit the registration certificates to the Public Utilities Bureau for inspection. Pledge is only allowed after the Public Utilities Bureau has verified the certificates. (5) When necessary, the Social Affairs, Public Security, and Public Utilities Bureaus may send personnel to each pawnshop for spot checks at any time. (6) If a pawnshop's procedures are unclear or violate the above rules, it will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. (7) If there are any matters not covered in these rules, the Social Affairs, Public Security, and Public Utilities Bureaus may jointly amend them temporarily. (8) These rules shall take effect from the date of approval by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Public Concession: Meat Market Cold Storage Rental Prices <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Sanitation Office previously constructed a meat market and cold storage facility at the corner of D'Arc Road and Rue Kiao-King Road in Hongkou, next to the Public Works Department Slaughterhouse. The entire project has now been completed and is scheduled to officially open tomorrow (November 1st). The rental fees have been drafted into a memorandum by the head of the Sanitation Office and the veterinarian, reported to the Sanitation Committee, and agreed upon by the head of the Finance Office, submitted to the Public Works Department Board of Directors, and approved for implementation. The general details are as follows: The rental fees for the slaughterhouse cold storage are divided into the following three categories: (A) 3.3 cents of silver per pound every half month. (Ordinary long-term storage or pre-cooling rooms, calculated on a 15-day basis). (B) (6.1 silver dollars per cubic meter per month) Ordinary long-term storage rooms, ranging from 891 to 2,170 cubic feet. (C) Very long-term storage rooms (ice rooms), single cubic meter or double cubic meter, 6 or 12 silver dollars per month. As for the meat market rental fees, the original plan was to open the meat market first without charging rental fees, so that the general butchers could use it themselves. After a considerable period of time, rental fees would be collected. Subsequently, the Deputy Director of the Finance Office, considering that the current prices were already very low, believed that an additional 30% should be added to the existing rates. As a result, the Sanitation Committee decided that the Sanitation and Finance Offices of the Public Works Department should formulate a standard price, charging half the amount from November 1st to the end of the year, and the full amount from January 1st of the following year. The following standard prices have since been set: Cattle and horses, including their appendages, 1.35 silver dollars per head; calves and pigs, including appendages, 70 cents of silver per head; sheep and goats, including appendages, 35 cents of silver per head. The above prices include cold storage convenience and the period shall not exceed seven days. The above prices were approved by the Public Works Department Board of Directors at its regular meeting yesterday.</p>

Regarding the special concert for young people, according to the original proposal of the Public Works Department Band's chief conductor, it was planned to hold four Friday concerts at the Lyceum Theatre within several months of this winter and next spring. However, after the Finance Director reviewed it, he suggested holding two special concerts for young people within this year first, based on the results, to determine whether to proceed next year, as there was a financial loss when this concert was held last year. As a result, the Music Committee accepted the Finance Director's opinion and advocated holding two special concerts for young people this year. The first one will be held on November 8th, and the second one on December 20th. Regarding the establishment of a singing concert, at the previous meeting, a certain gentleman suggested adding singing performances to the Public Works Department Band's performances, and proposed that the Public Works Department hire a Russian singing group. However, it was heard that the required cost was as high as 15,000 to 16,000 silver dollars per year. The Finance Director and the Band's chief conductor both felt that the cost was too high, so the discussion was stopped. Furthermore, regarding next year's music festival, the local Public Works Department Band may be suspended in the spring of next year, so there was a suggestion to issue a general mobilization order to all the musical talents in this city to prepare for the celebration of the festival. The method is to use the Public Works Department Band as the main body, and the local singing groups and other appropriate music groups can be invited to cooperate as appropriate. The Music Committee believes that this proposal is quite insightful and expresses its great approval. However, it feels that it is very difficult to find a suitable rehearsal location. As a result, it was agreed that a preliminary investigation should be started first. It is heard that the above-mentioned measures were all approved at yesterday's regular meeting of the Public Works Department Board of Directors and put on file. Furthermore, the Music Committee expressed its gratitude that the Band's chief conductor recently invited several students from the Chinese National Conservatory of Music to join the Public Works Department Band's performance.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Salary Deduction for Disaster Relief: Sailors Negotiate with China Merchants Bureau, Causing Sailors' Concerns and Determining Donation Methods <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The army's various districts suffered from floods, and all civil servants must have half a month's salary deducted and deducted in two installments. The sailors serving on various merchant ships in this city, especially the drivers and machinists on the Jianghai ships of the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, received an order from the Ministry. Because the sailors are technical personnel, they are not within the scope of civil servants as a rule, and it does not seem appropriate to deduct their salaries for disaster relief. However, for the sake of disaster relief, everyone has sympathy, and the sailors will donate voluntarily. However, the Bureau instructed that all sailors must still have half a month's salary deducted for disaster relief and deducted from October. When the sailors received the news, they went to the Machinist and Driver Guilds, requesting that a letter be sent to the China Merchants Bureau, which firmly believed that sailors were forced to be civil servants and ordered to deduct their salaries for disaster relief. However, the sailors work on the sea, away from their hometowns. They do not have the pleasure of a home all year round and fight in the wind and waves all year round, and their monthly salaries are very low. Their monthly income and expenses are already fixed. Now that half a month's salary is deducted, the sailors will be affected economically. They have asked the guild to send a letter to the Bureau, requesting that the sailors' double salaries that should have been received over the years be deducted from the deposit as disaster relief donations. They are willing to help for half a month at a time and not deduct it from their current monthly salaries so as not to affect their livelihoods. However, the two guilds sent several letters, but the Bureau did not reply or express whether it agreed or disagreed. The sailors were very angry and went to the two guilds again yesterday, asking them to send another letter to the Bureau for a final question. If the Bureau still does not reply, it is considered to be deliberately making things difficult. The sailors will not recognize the deducted salary, no matter what, and order it to reply soon to avoid disputes.</p>

<p>Regarding the news of the Kwong Wah Oil Company's acquisition by state ownership, Mr. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company, stated yesterday that since the establishment of the Kwong Wah Oil Company, its achievements have been remarkable in recent years, and its sales have been very strong. The company has invested a large amount of capital in various oil storage constructions, but to achieve greater expansion, it is beyond the power of a few people. Therefore, I previously suggested that the government take it over for state ownership. After careful consideration by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, personnel were sent to Shanghai and Hankou for inspection and were satisfied. It has now been reported to the government authorities. As for whether to take it over for state ownership or increase capital, the company is quietly awaiting the government's decision.</p>

<p>Yang Xiji Foreign Goods Store and Baosen Shen Zhuang, located at No. 6 Lane 9, Taiwan Road, were established by Yang Bixiang and Xu Minghua from Ningbo, respectively. Baosen was insured for 1,000 yuan of fire insurance with the North American Insurance Company, while Yang Xiji was insured for 7,000 yuan with the Haohua and Xiangtai Insurance Company. At 4:30 AM on the 19th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out in the two shops. The Fire Department made every effort to extinguish the fire, preventing it from spreading to the neighbors. However, after an investigation by Chinese detectives Pang Ruiqing, Bao Sun Dafa, and Chen Ruisheng of the Laozha Gate Police Station, it was discovered that there were suspicions of arson. Yang and Xu were arrested, along with Yang Xiji's accountant Tong Binhou and apprentices Hu Xiangsheng and Xu Mingcai from Baosen, and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and custody. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. After an investigation by the police station, it was learned that the arson was instigated by Yang Xixiang in order to claim the insurance money. He secretly arranged for Zhu Wusheng, who was on the run, to start the fire. He had previously notified Tong Binhou and instructed him not to destroy the evidence. However, Xu Minghua, Xu Mingcai, and Hu Xiangsheng did not participate in the premeditation. Only Yang Xixiang and Tong Binhou were prosecuted according to Article 173 of the Criminal Law. Xu and the other three were not prosecuted. The interrogation by the First Special Court has been concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye took the bench and sentenced Yang Xixiang to three years and six months in prison for instigating arson and destroying an inhabited building.

Recently, many audience members have written jointly requesting the stage to retain actor Li for another performance.

<h3 id="e160">First Draft of "Comprehensive Treatise on the Spring and Autumn Annals" Published <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The "Spring and Autumn Annals" occupies an important position in Chinese scholarship. Scholars throughout history have argued endlessly, but those who have traced its origins and established their own unique banner are very few. It is now heard that the Zhen Society in Hangzhou has published a book entitled "Comprehensive Treatise on the Spring and Autumn Annals," which is the first draft written by Mao Qi of Dinghai. The entire book is divided into four chapters: (1) Confucius and the Spring and Autumn Annals; (2) The Beginning and End of the Spring and Autumn Annals; (3) The Authors of the Commentaries; (4) The Teachings of the Spring and Autumn Annals. Each chapter is based on extensive evidence and presents new theories with insightful observations. For example, it argues that the "Spring and Autumn Annals" is the "Lu Spring and Autumn Annals," that Confucius only wrote commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals, that Guliang was written for Shen Gong, and that Quyang was written for Humu Sheng. It also argues that the teachings of the Spring and Autumn Annals lie in governing the world, and that it elucidates the complete personality of Confucius, all of which are unprecedented insights. It also makes many corrections to the theories of recent scholars such as Zhang Taiyan. In today's rectification of national studies, where specialized works on the Spring and Autumn Annals are rarely heard, this book deserves attention. The price is seventy cents, and it is sold by Shanghai and various local Shenghuo bookstores.</p>

<h3 id="e164">The First Sign of Closer Sino-Japanese Cultural Education: Japan's Boxer Indemnity, 1.72 Million Yuan Annually, Subsidizes Exchange Students Between China and Japan <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) Amidst the calls for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Japan plans to carry out Sino-Japanese educational and cultural undertakings. According to sources, the Japanese Boxer Indemnity, amounting to 1.72 million Japanese yen annually, has been entirely managed and distributed by the Bureau of Chinese Cultural Affairs of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs since 1931. Because the Japanese found it inconvenient to proceed alone, they organized the Sino-Japanese Cultural Committee. It was expected that the committee's authority would be determined during the second Sino-Japanese General Committee meeting in Beiping, making it an independent cultural organization. However, the Japanese side refused to discuss it, citing the Japanese National Assembly Act and the Japanese Accounting Law. As a result, the hope of using the Japanese Boxer Indemnity to subsidize Sino-Japanese cultural undertakings was suspended for ten years. Currently, some Chinese and Japanese educators advocate dividing the Japanese Boxer Indemnity into two parts. One part would subsidize Chinese students studying in Japan, and a committee jointly organized by various provinces in North China would select university graduates to study science and engineering in Japan. The other part of the Japanese Boxer Indemnity would subsidize Japanese students' expenses for books and tours while studying geology, literature, and history at Chinese universities. It is heard that this is currently being pursued in Beiping.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Ministry of Education Explains Compilation of Educational Laws and Regulations <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has compiled and published several matters regarding educational laws and regulations that were previously submitted by various provinces and cities for explanation and have been separately instructed but not yet published in newspapers. One item is that the Jiangxi Education Department inquired about "The Provisional Regulations for Teacher Certification in Secondary Schools and Normal Schools, regarding the qualifications of various types of teachers, all have regulations on several years of teaching experience after graduating from a certain school. If the school where they have taught is a primary school, can they apply for certification as a junior high school teacher? If it is a junior high school, can they apply for certification as a senior high school teacher? Should the subject they have taught be limited to the subject they studied at university or institute?" The response was: (1) Regarding the so-called teaching experience in the Provisional Regulations for Teacher Certification in Secondary Schools and Normal Schools, for graduates from specialized or higher institutions, the teaching experience is not limited to what level of school. For graduates from schools equivalent to senior vocational or middle school level, the teaching experience should be limited to secondary schools. (2) The subject they have taught is not limited to the subject they studied at university or specialized school. Another item is that the Shandong Education Department inquired "What are the examination subjects for those who take the labor and household affairs subjects in the Middle School Teacher Certification Examination?" The response was: The specialized examination subjects for household affairs in the Middle School Teacher Certification Examination are (1) Family Economics and Management, (2) Family Hygiene, (3) Child Rearing Methods. The specialized examination subjects for labor (crafts) are (1) Introduction to Materials and Tools, (2) Drawing Work Diagrams, (3) Practical Production. The specialized examination subjects for labor (agriculture) are (1) Crop Science, (2) Horticulture, (3) Afforestation, (4) Animal Husbandry. Another item is that the Shanghai Education Bureau, based on a request from the private Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School to confirm the qualifications of its graduates, was instructed that the qualifications of graduates from the undergraduate program of the school are equivalent to those of graduates from normal schools, and the qualifications of graduates from the short-term program of the school are equivalent to those of graduates from simplified normal schools. Another item is the explanation of the Secondary Education Statistical Table and various school survey forms issued by the Ministry in the 13th year of the Republic: (1) The words "county and city" before the word "established" in the title of the survey form should be deleted. All national, provincial, municipal, county, and private secondary schools should fill them out separately according to their respective establishment. (2) The number of classes in the class and student column on the survey form refers to the number of classes in each grade. (3) The blank space under the total of the junior and senior high school graduates column on the survey form is for schools to fill in the classes of a certain subject or other types of schools attached. If the schools do not have separate subjects or attached other types of classes, they should fill them in under the total. (4) The three words "more school numbers" in Article 2 of the instructions for filling out the survey form should be deleted. (5) According to the regulations for vocational schools promulgated by the Ministry, the midwifery department is classified under the household affairs category, and midwifery schools should be included in household affairs vocational schools.</p>

<p>Li Jinxi of the National Language Council Elaborates on the Ministry of Education's Efforts to Promote Phonetic Chinese Characters, the Selection of Characters Took Four Months to Complete, the Implementation Method of Nine Articles Promulgated by the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jinxi, a standing committee member of the National Language Promotion Council, recently published a detailed account of the Ministry of Education's efforts to promote phonetic Chinese characters. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency has specially recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>The Purpose of Casting and its Process, In November of the 23rd year of the Republic, the 39th regular meeting of the Preparatory Committee for National Language Unification of the Ministry of Education passed the proposal made by Committee Member Li Jinxi that a bronze mold for phonetic annotation of Chinese characters should be cast by the state. The proposal was submitted to the Ministry for review. In January of the 24th year, the Ministry adopted this proposal, convened a discussion meeting, and subsequently decided to allocate funds to entrust a business to cast the mold. On March 5th, the 202nd Executive Yuan meeting passed the proposal submitted by the Ministry to sign a contract with the Zhonghua Book Company to create a square-shaped typeface by attaching phonetic symbols to the side of the company's existing imitation Song long-style characters. In order to facilitate the printing of reading materials needed for short-term compulsory education and mass education, the Ministry first cast a No. 2 typeface, and then No. 3, No. 5, and No. 4 typefaces, completing the entire set of bronze molds within approximately one year. However, the molds cast by the Ministry were only to show promotion and to promote the phonetic Chinese characters. Businesses were also free to cast their own, but the style of the phonetic symbol mother mold must be shown to be standard to avoid misrepresentation. Therefore, the former National Language Council passed the proposal made by Committee Member Li Jinxi at the 43rd regular meeting on March 3rd, requesting the Ministry of Education to issue two types of typeface printing style methods for phonetic symbols for annotating Chinese characters and for independent use. After being passed, it was submitted to the Ministry and reviewed and printed into a booklet called "Phonetic Symbol Printing Style," which was promulgated in April for compliance.</p>
<p>The Selection of Phonetic Chinese Characters, In March of the 24th year, the Ministry entrusted a business to cast the bronze mold for phonetic Chinese characters, and instructed the former National Language Council to quickly select the Chinese characters for this project. Regarding the number of Chinese characters for this project, there were approximately three opinions: (1) It was advocated that the phonetic Chinese characters should be used as a method of limiting the number of characters used, and a basic set of Chinese characters should be established, with approximately 1,100 characters. (2) It was advocated that the number of characters needed in objective reality should be the scope, with approximately 3,000 characters commonly used by children and the masses. First, cast the combined commonly used characters, and at most 6,000 to 7,000 characters, and then increase the casting. (3) It was advocated that all Chinese characters should be annotated with phonetics, and the more uncommon the characters, the more appropriate it is to determine the pronunciation and annotate them. In the future, all old books should be printed with phonetic Chinese characters, so that everyone can recite and read them. The National Language Council established a special group meeting and decided to adopt the second opinion as the selection principle. Based on this principle, the most economical method was used to select the characters. First, various vocabularies that met this principle were written on separate cards, character by character, and arranged and organized in the order of the commonly used Chinese character vocabulary in the National Language. This selection work lasted from March to the end of June and included 6,788 characters, which is the total number of characters in the phonetic Chinese character typeface.</p>
<p>Textbooks specializing in teaching phonetic symbols are prepared for primary school remedial classes and short-term literacy classes, as well as preliminary learning for mass education. However, it is also not permissible to mechanically learn the alphabet, but to spell simple and meaningful words and sentences. Because phonetic Chinese characters can promote children's and the masses' ability to read, recite, and practice writing, their effect is greater than simplified characters, which only facilitate writing. Therefore, attention should be paid to making appropriate preparations. On September 3rd, the Ministry of Education formulated nine implementation methods to facilitate promotion. This is the entire process.</p>
<p>Nine Implementation Methods Prescribed by the Ministry of Education, Attached are the nine articles of the Ministry of Education's promulgated Promotion of Phonetic Chinese Characters: (1) All texts in textbooks for mass schools and short-term primary schools must be entirely in phonetic Chinese characters. (2) The new word list in the Chinese language textbook for elementary primary schools must be entirely in phonetic Chinese characters. (3) The textbooks for social studies, nature (or general knowledge) in elementary primary schools, and the textbooks for Chinese language, social studies (geography and history), nature, and hygiene in advanced primary schools should be entirely in phonetic Chinese characters. (4) Starting from the first semester of the first grade of elementary primary school, phonetic symbols should be taught first, and after practice becomes proficient, then the Chinese text should be taught. In the future, all newly compiled Chinese language textbooks for elementary primary schools should compile a separate first volume before the first volume, dedicated to phonetic symbols, compiled into stories, for teaching purposes. The teaching method should be based on first synthesis and then analysis. The above regulations may be temporarily modified and implemented by local educational administrative agencies in areas where there is a shortage of teachers to teach phonetic symbols. (5) Starting from July of the 25th year of the Republic, all newly compiled textbooks and books for elementary schools and mass schools must comply with these regulations, otherwise they will not be approved.</p>
<p>Phonetic Chinese Character Promotion Method, In January of the 24th year, the Ministry decided to allocate funds to cast the bronze mold for phonetic Chinese characters. In March, the 43rd regular meeting of the former National Language Council passed the proposal made by Committee Member Li Jinxi and others, requesting the Ministry of Education to stipulate that all textbooks for various subjects in primary schools and reading materials for children and the masses should be printed with phonetic Chinese characters. After being passed, it was submitted to the Ministry for review and implementation. In June, when the Ministry convened a meeting to discuss the first batch of simplified character lists, the original proposer of this case collected opinions from all parties on this case, and finally summarized them into eight points and reported them to the Ministry for reference. (1) In the main text of the official primary school Chinese language textbooks, new characters should be printed with this typeface, and non-new characters should not. The reason is that each subject in primary school teaching has its own main purpose. One of the purposes of the Chinese language subject is to practice writing. Chinese character teaching requires mandatory memorization. If non-new characters are also annotated with phonetics, children will lose the opportunity for mandatory memorization, which is not in line with the purpose of this subject. (2) The textbooks for all subjects other than Chinese language in the lower-level primary schools, i.e., arithmetic, social studies, nature, and hygiene, should all be printed with this typeface. Because the teaching of these subjects each has its own main purpose, the purpose is not to practice language. Therefore, all characters should be annotated with phonetics to avoid reducing the efficiency of teaching this subject due to language barriers. (3) All extracurricular reading materials used in official primary schools and short-term literacy classes, as well as all reading materials and textbooks used in mass education, must be absolutely printed with this typeface to facilitate reading and increase knowledge. (4) Briefly discuss with the Shanghai publishing industry that in the future, Chinese language textbooks for elementary primary schools should compile a separate first volume, which uses only phonetic symbols to spell simple words and sentences, so that children can fully recognize phonetic symbols before reading the text of Chinese characters. Also, compile separately (6) All levels of normal schools in various provinces and cities should teach phonetic symbols, so that normal school graduates have the skills to teach phonetic symbols. (7) During the transition period, all primary schools must set aside a portion of the time in the Chinese language subject to specialize in teaching phonetic symbols. (8) Starting from January of the 25th year of the Republic, all editors of reading materials for children and the masses must print them with phonetic Chinese characters. (9) The Ministry and the educational administrative agencies of various provinces and cities should encourage all newspapers to print with phonetic Chinese characters as much as possible within the possible scope.</p>

<p>The Chinese Boy Scout movement has been around for 24 years since its inception in the first year of the Republic. During this period, it has experienced times of prosperity and decline. Since the 17th year of the Republic, it has been effectively led and managed by our Party, and after the establishment of the Boy Scout Headquarters, the national Boy Scout movement has advanced according to regulations. The Chinese Boy Scouts, which used to be scattered, disorganized, and independent, gradually moved towards unification of organization and training. At that time, the Party Boy Scout Commander took the position that the headquarters organization only shouldered the responsibility of leading the Boy Scouts towards unification. He vigorously advocated the general association system. He first obtained the support of Mr. Dai Jitao, and on April 14th of the 21st year of the Republic, he submitted the organizational plan to the Central Standing Committee, which was approved. A general association preparatory office was first established, and on November 1st of the 23rd year of the Republic, the official establishment of the Chinese Boy Scout General Association was announced. However, time flies, and one year has passed since the establishment of the General Association. Under the leadership of the General Association, all Boy Scouts in the country are happy and inspired, showing a new atmosphere. The City Scout Council has received the order from the General Association and has decided to hold a celebration ceremony tomorrow (November 1st) at 1:00 PM at the City Sports Stadium on Dajilu, Nanshi. Each troop will send two or more members in uniform to participate in the celebration. There will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<p>全體名單　昨日南返者除總領隊陸起華外、尙有副領隊　贊唐、管理員楊因、男隊員蘇方能、黃景煥、劉焜、梁顯明、陳傳路、龐永麟、雷秉昌、黃瑞文、女隊員鄧海珍、龐永芳韋韶生、黃美莉、許振婉、李俠超、陳希賢等十八人、桂選手除黃瑞文一人參加長跑外、餘均參加游泳、在全運中男游泳獲第五、女游泳獲第三、成續尙屬不差、</p>
<p>Full List of Names: In addition to head delegate Lu Qihua, those who returned south yesterday also included deputy team leader Zan Tang, manager Yang Yin, male athletes Su Fangneng, Huang Jinghuan, Liu Kun, Liang Xianming, Chen Chuanlu, Pang Yonglin, Lei Bingchang, Huang Ruiwen, female athletes Deng Haizhen, Pang Yongfang, Wei Shaosheng, Huang Meili, Xu Zhenwan, Li Xiachao, and Chen Xixian, eighteen people in total. Except for Huang Ruiwen, who participated in the long-distance running, the Guangxi athletes all participated in swimming. In the National Games, the men's swimming team won fifth place, and the women's swimming team won third place, a not-bad result.</p>
<p>領隊談話　昨據該隊總領隊陸起華氏、對國光社記者談桂省因僻處西陲、交通不便、體育茶為幼稚、近由省主席黃旭初氏努力提倡體育漸漸發達、且趨於軍事化、以前五屆全運會桂均未曾參加、故本屆實為破天荒第一次、參加項目僅長跑及游泳兩項、因桂省經濟及地勢關係、於球類遝動發展不易、對於游泳攀山長跑三項則較為普遍、此次南旋對體育當更加注意、積極提倡、以求邁進、又敝隊來滬參加全運、技術幼稚、深望國人予以指敎、留此一月、謬承各界殷殷致意、今日言別殊覺依依云、</p>
<p>Team Leader's Remarks: Yesterday, according to Lu Qihua, the head delegate of the team, told a reporter from the Guoguang News Agency that because Guangxi Province is located in a remote western region with inconvenient transportation, sports were still in their infancy. Recently, under the vigorous promotion of sports by Provincial Chairman Huang Xuchu, sports have gradually developed and are becoming more militarized. Guangxi had not participated in the previous five National Games, so this year's was a groundbreaking first. The only events participated in were long-distance running and swimming. Due to the economic and terrain conditions in Guangxi Province, it is not easy to develop ball sports. Swimming, mountain climbing, and long-distance running are more common. This time returning south, more attention should be paid to sports, and they should be actively promoted in order to make progress. In addition, our team came to Shanghai to participate in the National Games, and our skills are still immature. We sincerely hope that our compatriots will give us guidance. Staying here for a month, we have received warm greetings from all walks of life. It is especially reluctant to say goodbye today.</p>

<p>Little Men (8) (〇)</p>
<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott of the United States, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Who knew that she would reply fiercely, "Who wants to come! Not me; what gentlemen! I hate these boys!" Her hand was still hurting a lot, so she began to regret that she shouldn't have been so reckless just now, and realized that she could have used a smarter method to express her anger.</p>
<p>"Alas, you hate my boys? That's unfortunate. In fact, when they are willing, they are not unable to take care of politeness and make others feel comfortable. True politeness exists in the attitude, and thoughtfulness of others in words and deeds. This is something everyone can have, as long as they are willing to treat others the way they hope others will treat them."</p>
<p>Mrs. Pei seemed to be talking to Nan'en, but the children explained it to each other with their elbows, and it seemed that they could understand the point quite well, at least at that time, because they passed the butter dishes to their neighbors, saying "Please," and "Thank you," "Yes, sir," "No, miss," etc., really polite. Nan'en didn't say a word, just kept quiet, wanting to tickle her neighbor but never dared to, because he was so solemn. She seemed to have forgotten her hatred for the boys at this time, and played the "I see you" game with them until dark. During the game, someone would often give her their candy stick to taste, which clearly made her temper better, because the last words she said before going to sleep were:</p>
<p>"After my son and I get the boards, I will let you play."</p>

<p>Several Important Tasks for the Development of the Future of Domestic Products</p>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>As everyone knows, at present, if we want to save the Chinese national economy from danger and death, and put many people struggling on the line of bankruptcy and death into a state of living and working in peace and contentment, we can only take the road of developing domestic products and revitalizing industry. This is the only correct direction. However, in recent years, the progress of domestic products cannot be said to be weak, but the future of domestic products is undoubtedly still struggling on a very difficult road. Objective environmental obstructions and obstacles are heavy. What is the reason for this? Here, I hope everyone will never attribute it to the saying of fate, but know that the success of domestic products is by no means a matter of overnight. It really requires us to have greater courage to work hard and struggle, and to open up a new path from the dark road.</p>
<p>We can see several problems facing the domestic product industry at the present stage, such as narrow sales, overproduction, stagnation of economic turnover rate, and the obstruction of outward expansion of the market. These are all great regrets. On the other hand, we can see those foreign factories set up in China. In addition to their strong capital and large equipment, they also pay attention to the quality of their products, the sales methods, and the convenience of transportation methods, which make us feel beyond our reach. Therefore, I deeply feel that in the current progress of the future of domestic products, in addition to working hard to develop outward, it seems that there is still a need to pay attention to industrial organization, management methods, and production technology. Now I will write down the above points, hoping that the entire industrial community will quickly pay attention and implement them:</p>
<p>First, improve production technology. In recent years, domestic products have become more and more exquisite due to the encouragement of people from all walks of life. However, due to the competition of the same industry, it is inevitable that they have to make up for it by cutting corners and reducing materials. From now on, we should resolutely get rid of this behavior of quenching thirst with poison, and should strive to improve production technology. On the one hand, we should reduce costs and lower prices, and on the other hand, we should adapt to the needs of customers and strive to make the products exquisite.</p>
<p>Second, strive for financial cooperation. The trend of economic depression has made the financial community tighten loans to industries. In this crisis, the domestic product community should thoroughly cooperate with the financial community to open up a way out. At present, the following should be implemented first: (1) Replace the current credit loans with the discounting of commercial acceptance drafts, (2) Replace the current movable property pledge loans with bank acceptance drafts, (3) Replace the current factory base pledge loans with the acceptance of company debt notes.</p>
<p>Third, promote domestic raw materials. Manufacturers engaged in domestic product industries should try their best to use domestic raw materials. At the same time, they should find ways to develop and promote raw materials that are not yet available in China, so that they can not only prevent huge leaks but also increase rural income, which is to promote the purchasing power of domestic products among general farmers.</p>
<p>Fourth, study transportation convenience. In the future, the way out for domestic products will undoubtedly be in the border provinces and overseas markets. The study of transportation methods is very important. We should study and implement how to make freight rates low, and how to prevent goods from being damaged in transit, and how to ensure speed.</p>
<p>Originally, there are many ways to develop domestic products, and establishing the reputation of domestic products is especially the primary plan. We must gain the unanimous confidence of the people of the whole country in domestic products and create the strongest foundation for the future of the national industry.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Reducing Costs is the Key to National Goods' Survival <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Yuan Bingyuan returned from a factory inspection trip to Europe and America. When a reporter asked him about his impressions of inspecting industries in fifteen countries, Mr. Gu said that all countries are making tireless efforts to produce and expand overseas markets. Countries such as Germany, England, Sweden, Austria-Hungary, the United States, and Japan are particularly focused on refining their manufacturing, aiming solely to reduce costs and offer lower prices. There are many methods to achieve lower prices, but a consistent focus on training technical talent and striving for scientific management is a common trend. Particularly commendable is the industry of Czechoslovakia. The operation of the Bata shoe factory resembles an industrial complex, with the entire factory forming a self-contained district. It employs no fewer than 30,000 workers. Workers' housing, consumer goods, public utilities, and public entertainment are all managed by the company through bulk purchases and retail distribution. As a result, the living standards of workers are lower compared to areas outside the industrial zone. The same worker, working at the Bata factory, earns a monthly wage of 50 yuan, while outside, it would require 70 or 80 yuan. Therefore, workers are willing to work at the factory, which implicitly reduces many costs. This is why Bata shoes are invincible worldwide. As for scientific management, while it emphasizes the precision of machinery and the training of personnel, and the seriousness of time economy, the meticulousness, lack of perfunctoriness, and lack of procrastination in handling matters are also worthy of emulation by our national goods industry. In various countries' business sectors, from the government to the managers and staff of factories and shops, there is a consistent emphasis on precise calculations, adherence to time, and the utmost seriousness and speed in handling matters, which is truly admirable. In Italy and Germany, since Mussolini and Hitler came to power, the intensity of work is visible everywhere. Even regarding the issue of not delaying documents, there is an interesting anecdote to tell: they advocate not using drawers in office desks, believing that having drawers often leads to placing pending matters inside, thinking that if it is not done today, it can wait until tomorrow. As more and more accumulates, it becomes difficult to handle and is seen as a problem, and there is never hope for swift progress in any endeavor. Therefore, everyone believes that drawers are obstacles in handling matters, and it is better to abolish them directly. Although this is a small detail, it has great value for adoption or research in scientific management. I am also introducing it to inform my comrades in the national goods industry.</p>
<h3 id="e191">The National Goods Movement in the Past Month <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>In the national goods movement of the past month, I feel that there are several things that need to be brought up and discussed. I will write them down one by one below and add my personal opinions, hoping that our national goods future is not without hope, as long as people are willing to work hard and those in power are willing to genuinely promote it.</p>
<p>(1) The Social Bureau Strictly Regulates the Organization of National Goods Markets: The rise of national goods markets in the past year can be said to have been a great trend for a time. From the perspective of promoting national goods, it seems to be a good phenomenon. However, according to newspaper reports, disputes have occurred in national goods markets in many places, such as Nantong and Wuxi, due to unsound organizations. This is a regrettable matter and greatly hinders the future promotion of national goods. Now, the Social Bureau, in view of this, has specifically and strictly stipulated the organizational regulations for national goods markets, with thoughtful considerations, which can prevent the occurrence of disputes in national goods markets in the future and increase the general public's good impression of national goods and markets. This is also a gratifying thing.</p>
<p>(2) The Guangdong Education Department Bans Student Decorations: The Guangdong Education Department has three regulations for the decorations of students in the province, instructing them to be uniformly observed: (1) Students must wear clothes made of national goods materials; (2) Female students must not perm their hair; (3) The use of cosmetics and wearing high heels are prohibited, etc. As the Student National Goods Year is about to end, the Guangdong Education Department's attention to this is something we cannot regard as a mere formality. We hope that other provincial education authorities will also proceed in unison to achieve a final grand effect for the Student National Goods Year.</p>
<p>(3) Liang Tongfang and Others Organize a National Goods Promotion Group: Patriotic individuals such as Liang Tongfang, in order to promote the sale of national goods, specially united with many like-minded people to organize a National Goods Promotion Group. On the one hand, they solicited national goods from various factories and national goods organizations, and on the other hand, they hired national goods industry leaders such as Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Yangyao, and Fang Yexian as consultants to provide guidance as needed. This is very worthy of emulation and promotion by young people who love to use national goods.</p>
<p>(4) The General Labor Union Organizes a National Goods Sales Team: The Shanghai General Labor Union, in order to relieve unemployed workers, specially contacted various factories to organize a national goods sales team, both to relieve workers' unemployment and to promote the sales of national goods by French law. It is a good thing to kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>(5) The Social Bureau Bans Foreign Names for National Goods: The use of foreign languages for national goods is indeed a very shameful thing. The Social Bureau is currently dispatching personnel to secretly investigate and will ban the use of foreign names for national goods. This has a great relationship with the psychological construction aspect of promoting national goods.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I feel that in the national goods movement of the past month, there has been obvious progress. Therefore, I do not hesitate to express it, and I inform those who generally care about the national goods movement.</p>
<h3 id="e192">National Goods Wool Yarn <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting colder, and the sales of wool yarn are about to surge again. Don't think this is a small thing, people's needs for it are even greater than for cotton and leather goods. Because it suits everyone's taste, both the poor and the rich like it; and the things made from it, both men and women, old and young, can use, such as shirts, pants, hats, socks, gloves, scarves, and women's coats, etc. Think about how much of it is needed in a year!</p>
<p>The reason why wool yarn is popular is first and foremost because it is strong and durable, so economical housewives all like it. Think about making a set of cotton-padded clothes for a child. Although the price is cheap, the child will jump around and damage it in at most one or two years; a set of wool yarn clothes, no matter how you wear it, will last at least five years. So, isn't wool yarn cheaper than cotton cloth! Moreover, wool yarn is elastic, so it doesn't matter if it's made a little smaller; it doesn't matter if it's made a little bigger. It's not like cotton cloth, which can't be worn if it's too small; and it's not warm enough if it's too big. Because of this, it has increased people's welcome.</p>
<p>The second advantage is that it is light and soft. A cotton-padded jacket made too thick will be too heavy to bear; made too thin, it will have no warmth at all; and after wearing it for one or two years, the cotton will be pressed as hard as a board, making it cold and uncomfortable to wear. Wool yarn has none of these drawbacks, which is another major reason for its popularity.</p>
<p>Wool yarn has such a need in the family, but unfortunately the market is full of foreign goods, which is really a big leak. Fortunately, starting in the past few years, our national goods have also appeared. The earliest is the Tianjin-made Ram Brand wool yarn. For the sake of national goods, it was also popular for a time. This year, Double Hands Brand wool yarn and others have also been issued. Isn't this a good phenomenon in the national goods industry!</p>
<p>We almost all know that the manufacture of wool yarn uses processed wool and plant fibers. If there is more wool and less fiber, then the finished product is soft and strong, meeting the standard of excellence; otherwise, it will be rough and hard, and lose hair, which is not welcomed. The Bee Brand in foreign goods meets this excellent standard, so everyone likes to use it, and it is still a force to be reckoned with! The price of domestically produced wool yarn is of course cheaper; but we must also pay attention to softness and firmness, so that it will not be defeated by foreign goods!</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Bleaching Method of Rice Straw Pulp (10) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Making paper from rice straw was originally an ancient Chinese method. The bleaching process completely utilized sun exposure, called "native sun-drying," and did not require any chemicals. Today, using sulfite for bleaching is called "semi-sun-drying." If the color is desired to be pure white, it must be repeated several times, but it is easy to waste and disappear, which is not cost-effective. Manufacturing newsprint is sufficient with just this. Otherwise, the semi-sun-dried product should be boiled and exposed to sunlight in the open field for a long time. After being fully exposed to sunlight for a long time, its color will also turn white, which saves half the effort compared to native sun-drying, so it is called "semi-sun-drying." However, there are points to pay attention to in the bleaching process of making semi-sun-dried products, which I will explain in detail.</p>
<p>Rice straw pulp made with lime must first be soaked in a 1-degree hydrochloric acid solution to dissolve the lime into soluble calcium chloride, which can then be washed away. Otherwise, the lime will be covered on the outside, costing a lot of bleaching material, which is not cost-effective. When using sodium sulfite to bleach, it should first be dissolved into a 0.5% solution, and then the straw pulp that has passed through hydrochloric acid should be immersed in it for about three or four hours and taken out, and then immersed in a 1-degree hydrochloric acid solution. At this time, the above-mentioned amounts of the two solutions are only the maximum values. In fact, they are all added to the beater, which contains a lot of water, and it is impossible to accurately determine their weight. Therefore, it is like cooking, entirely dependent on the operator's experience to observe in large quantities and use appropriately. This is the same as a doctor prescribing medicine. It is absolutely impossible to copy a prescription from a medical book. Whether the doctor is skilled or not lies in this. However, if the amount of medicine used exceeds the maximum, even if the effect is immediately visible, it will definitely cause a lot of loss to the body. If it is insufficient, then its effect will be too weak, and it cannot be achieved with one dose. The effective components contained in the medicine used are also quite relevant. Even the length of heating and tapping time is very different from the loss of the finished product. Therefore, in the initial trial, there is often 100 jin of pulp, but the finished product is only half, or even as little as one-third. This is no different from cooking meat. If it is overcooked, it will definitely rot and turn into porridge. Even if it completely disappears, it is possible and not surprising.</p>
<p>The above method is all for newsprint purposes, and it is cheap. If you want to make fine paper that will remain white and unchanged forever, then you should use "sodium hypochlorite" to bleach, which is the most cost-effective. Its equation is Nacioh, which is to electrolyze table salt, release one part of the light, and become "sodium green oxygen light," which is commonly known as bleach. Its effect is equivalent to "peroxygen light," so it can never change color, and the cost is low.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with Mr. Jin and Mr. Zhu for only a dozen minutes. Although Mr. Jin took notes based on my oral description, the points to pay attention to in the bleaching process were not described in detail. Therefore, I will explain it in detail as above. Minfeng has two factories, one in Jiaxing and one in Hangzhou. Recently, because the supply of yellow cardboard has exceeded demand, they are focusing on the production of white cardboard. The original white material is quite expensive. If straw pulp can be bleached, then in addition to self-use, it can be expanded and supplied to other factories. Anyone with a flat screen machine can make newsprint. In the past, the raw material problem could not be solved, so wood pulp was purchased, and its price was actually equal to cloth pulp. Not only was there no profit to be made, but also losses had to be covered. Making grass pulp by oneself would be too busy to experiment, and experimentation is definitely not something that can be successful and satisfactory at once, so one dares not to try lightly. The factory that has tried and succeeded at the expense of sacrifice, but it is a round screen machine that can only make single-sided glossy paper, and the drying cylinder is only 72 inches, so it is not cost-effective, and there is only one cooking ball, just like cooking rice in a small pot, which cannot handle a big meal. If Minfeng can adopt straw pulp, then there will definitely be no shortage of successors. The by-products of rural areas are not just rice straw, so they can be turned into money as much as possible, and firewood can be collected for cooking. After a year, they will follow suit and become a trend. Then, money will be produced all over the countryside, turning poverty into wealth, without having to wait for ten years for trees or a hundred years for people. I really look forward to Minfeng.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Talking About Honorary Degrees and National Goods Inventors <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zunyuan</p>
<p>Last month, Fudan University held a grand celebration of its 30th anniversary. At the same time, honorary doctorates were awarded to six people, including Sun Ke. Honorary master's and honorary bachelor's degrees were also awarded to a total of ten or more people. This is indeed a major event that attracts attention, but whether the university has the right to grant these honorary degrees or whether they should be granted by the state, I do not want to discuss here. What I want to talk about now is who should be awarded honorary degrees, in other words, what kind of talent can qualify for an honorary degree.</p>
<p>The history of honorary degrees in China did not start today. Recalling the early years of the Republic of China, when Xu Shichang was the president of the Beijing government, the University of Paris in France had already awarded him a doctorate in literature. A few years ago, the famous performer Mei Lanfang traveled to the New World, and Pomona College in the United States also awarded him a doctorate in literature. These are all precedents for foreigners awarding honorary degrees to Chinese people. Speaking of China itself, Shanghai's St. John's University has also awarded honorary degrees to people of reputation in the country. In fact, they, the recipients of these honorary degrees, are either important figures in politics or famous people in society. People like Xu and Sun are highly respected as presidents and deans. Their reputations have long been known throughout the country. Why bother those universities to give them these degrees? If it is thought that they have merits in politics and society, then the government should grant them medals and grades to give them corresponding rewards. Why is it necessary to abuse these degrees, which are specially intended to reward those who have made special contributions to culture and academics, and send them to those noble presidents and ministers' political views or those famous social figures? This inevitably tarnishes the value of the degrees. Moreover, what China should reward today is not the political views of those noble presidents and ministers, nor the social celebrities, but the scientists who are engaged in material construction and are tireless, so the state must encourage the inventors of material production, especially the inventors of national goods, with all its energy. However, in fact, I have never heard of a national goods inventor receiving an honorary degree.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will doubt why national goods inventors deserve such a reward?</p>
<p>This is easy to answer. National goods inventors are often able to make special discoveries in technology or machinery. It can be said that they have made considerable contributions to production, academics, and culture. Who else should be encouraged if not them? On the other hand, the materials they invent certainly bring many benefits to the country. The most obvious is that they can resist foreign goods, reduce trade deficits, eliminate waste, and increase the country's wealth. They also make great contributions to the national economy. Anyone who understands the principles of economics will know. Secondly, the relief of rural areas is currently the right medicine for the disease. Based on this, I believe that honorary degrees should be used entirely to reward inventors related to national production. That is to say, only national goods inventors are qualified to receive honorary degrees. In this way, honorary degrees have considerable regulations, and the qualifications of the recipients also have strict restrictions. Then, the dignity and preciousness of honorary degrees will not be lost.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Tenth of the Month and National Goods Factories <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>In this year of global panic and recession! Our country's national status and industry and commerce have entered a period of terminal illness! Although various parties have been prescribing medicine and trying to save the decline of industry and commerce! But it is still of no avail. Liquidation and closure are heard every day. The most practical emergency rescue measure is still the "Opinions on the Financing Problem" passed by the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee: replacing real estate mortgage loans with corporate bonds, and replacing factory operating loans with commercial acceptance bills. These are good methods, but in addition to the commercial acceptance bills that have been tried and seen results, the issuance of corporate bonds and whether they can be sold are still far from the reality! Even if the stock exchange allows it to be finalized, industry and commerce have declined so tragically! Whether anyone will buy it is a big question! The time has passed to the tenth of the month, and long-term loans to industry and commerce by the financial community must be repaid! However, the market is so depleted that, without a turnaround, we will all perish together! The National Goods Factory Federation submitted a petition to the Ministry to order the banking industry to settle interest and allow for refinancing, which is a last resort. If the banking industry can take the overall situation into consideration and provide assistance, this shows that the financial community and industry and commerce are truly united, standing on the same front, and seeking self-reliance! Mutual assistance in times of trouble, and then sharing joy in peace! It cannot but be called a good phenomenon!</p>
<p>Although: the author sincerely hopes that the managers of national goods factories and commercial firms will not forget to bury their heads in hard work! And business development, as well as cost reduction and a lively economic plan, and dig their own graves! We should redouble our efforts! This is what the author sincerely prays for.</p>

<h3 id="e196">In Memory of Mr. Ge Gongzhen <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Old friend Gongzhen, we have been apart for three years. The setting moon and lingering clouds, how can I not think of you? Sometimes, new geese pass by my small building, bringing a letter. Opening it and reading it repeatedly, the emotions are evident in the words. The tiny characters, clear and sparse, are like seeing the face of an old friend. However, with ten thousand miles separating us, it is difficult to pour out accumulated feelings. I can only wish him well for the country's sake. Last winter, Zhou Zijianyun and his wife and Ms. Hu Die traveled to Soviet Russia. I entrusted them with a small note to express my feelings. Soon, I received his reply, along with a colored portrait of the Russian literary master Gorky. The letter said:</p>
<p>Brother Shoujuan: Brother Jianyun came and brought your letter. I am delighted to know that your writings are better than ever, and I am even more envious of your peaceful life in Keli. I have been wandering overseas in recent years and am tired and homesick. However, Brother Jianyun will arrive in Shanghai before me. There is no need to elaborate on the situation here. I will go to Berlin the day after tomorrow for a short rest. I wrote a note at the beginning of the year to offer New Year's greetings. The Gorky portrait was accidentally inserted into the book. It has been a long time and I have not sent it. Now I am sending it with this letter, knowing that someone overseas misses you. I wish you and your wife peace. Your brother, Gongzhen. April 25th.</p>
<p>I was overjoyed to receive the letter and treasured it carefully. When Brother Jianyun returned, we talked about overseas affairs. He first mentioned Gongzhen, describing his diligent and studious nature. I was ashamed of my own decline and admired him even more. This time, Gongzhen returned from his travels, but I did not have a chance to see him. I was depressed due to commercial setbacks and losses. My old friends Xiaodie and Fuchao strongly invited me to travel to Huangshan to forget my worries. On the way back, on the train to Jixi, I read the Southeast Daily and suddenly learned the news of Gongzhen's death. I was shocked and could not calm down. The heavens have taken away my relatives and friends in recent years, and I can no longer count them. Anger accumulated in my heart, and I wanted to point to the sky and scold it. I did not expect the devastation to be endless, and now it has taken Gongzhen away from me! Alas, Gongzhen, I wanted to learn from you when you returned, but I thought there would be plenty of time and there was no need to rush to see you. I thought we could talk freely. Who knew that your return to your homeland seemed to be solely for the purpose of returning to your ancestral grave. In the blink of an eye, you suddenly passed away. Is it because you loved your country so much that you longed for this unfortunate homeland and wanted to bury your bones in this remnant of a mountain? Alas, Gongzhen, you are gone now. In this autumn of great difficulty for all parties, it is not unfortunate for you. How can the survivors bear the pain of losing a good friend! If your soul is conscious, how will it comfort me?</p>
<h3 id="e197">News of Wu Music (Qin) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Hua</p>
<p>In recent years, dance halls and singing pavilions, and foreign music have flourished, and nothing can be compared with them to please the ears and hearts. As for the art of the qin, it has almost become a lost art. The so-called noble hermits, playing Shang and Ke Yu, are just decorations for poetry, lyrics, and songs. This autumn, on the ninth day of the ninth month, Mr. Chengjiang Zhuang Jiancheng, a man of refined taste and soaring enthusiasm, invited qin friends from various provinces such as Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan, and Yue to meet at Gu's Yiyuan Garden. That morning, those who walked on the road to Hulong Road saw people passing by with qins, and those who did not know the matter pointed to it as Japanese people holding a qin meeting in a certain garden. (The qin and chess are both inherent arts of our country. Now, the seat of chess has been ceded to the Japanese, and the art of the qin will also be given to the Japanese? This is a small matter, but it is enough to show the psychology of the Chinese people.) Those who played the qin in the meeting were Li Zizhao, Wu Lansun, Guo Tongfu, Peng Ziqing, Zha Fuxi, Wu Xiangquan, Wu Xiangcen, Wu Xiangheng, and Zhuang Jiancheng. Li was 79 years old, the oldest, and Ms. Xiangcen and Xiangheng were the youngest, both under the age of twenty. Mr. Zha Fuxi was Zhuang's teacher. Zha said to people: Jiancheng is my disciple in the inner chamber. Jiancheng told me: He learned the qin from his teacher, not just the manipulation of the strings. He has discovered subtleties in the distinction of rhythm that have not been discovered by predecessors. He also said that rhythm is a rule, and sound is a natural sound. Today's performers often confine the natural sound to the rules of rhythm. This is the ability to excel in the art of playing the qin, but not enough to speak of the ultimate way of qin music. Zha played a song of Xiaoxiang Water and Clouds, a total of eighteen sections, written by Guo Chu of the Song Dynasty, whose laws belong to the one without shooting. The first three sections are harmonious and slow, so that the listener can see the misty state of the clouds and mountains and the hazy trees. The fourth section and below are soothing and expansive, leading people's minds to meet, like a boat traveling among the clouds and water. The most wonderful thing is that when the performance reaches the end, those who listen around are still leaning on the table, leaning on the machine, and leaning on the pillars as before. This is to restrain the inner and quiet the outer? Jiancheng played Changmen Yuan, expressing the grievance in the word Yuan, which cannot be said to be out of the blue, but it is different from the performance of the qin workers in the past. The other performances by Li and the others were all perfect. Mr. Zha took a picture of the meeting and dispersed. The owner of the garden, Mr. Yanping, said: In the autumn of the ninth year of the Republic, Mr. Ye Zhangbo of Hangzhou also held a grand qin meeting in this place. Dozens of people attended, and there were two monks and no women playing the qin. It is not impossible to say that today's meeting is better than the meeting in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Feng Feng <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Yi</p>
<p>I have never been willing to flatter people in my life, and I am especially afraid of talking about cheesy things, so writing this article is definitely not flattering Feng Feng, but recording Feng Feng. Here, I must first make a statement.</p>
<p>Speaking of the words "Feng Feng", most friends who like to watch singing and dancing will feel a little flushed, and they all know that she is good at performing flirtatious plays, and there is an unspeakable heat on the stage that will strongly burn the audience's heart. Anyone who has seen her has tasted that unspeakable taste. Therefore, in the ideals of ordinary people, she must be a romantic urban lady; otherwise, how can she be so profound on the stage?</p>
<p>However, unexpected things are not without exception. When she leaves the stage, you will never believe that she is the "Feng Feng" on the stage. You must say that she is a big country girl; originally, a set of blue cloth short jacket and pants, a pair of cloth-soled ten shoes, when she returns home, she does needlework, washes rice and vegetables, sweeps the floor and wipes the table, everything is done, and she still blushes when she sees strangers. Where is she like a fashionable singing and dancing star.</p>
<p>Her family is very poor. In addition to her parents, she also has a young brother, who all need the money that she earns to support them. Therefore, although she is one of the highest paid in the troupe, she never dares to waste a penny. She is very frugal with herself. She never hires a car when she goes out, and she is reluctant to buy a snack to eat when she is hungry. Every month, she gives all the money she receives to her mother, and only keeps two eight-opening books for herself.</p>
<p>Finally, I should introduce that she is the pillar of the Silver Moon Troupe. She is only sixteen years old this year. She has a naturally pleasing face, which is appropriately matched with a healthy and modern physique. Moreover, she has a very deep foundation in singing and dancing, and she is still diligently moving forward, which is incomparable with the current group of so-called stars who only know how to flirt and have no real talent. Because I feel that whether it is drama, movies, or singing and dancing, she is a very promising talent, so I am happy to record the above.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty: Struggling to Live, Seeing the Beloved Grandson, Shedding Tears; Remembering the Past in a Year of Famine, Sowing Wheat Bringing Disaster</p>
<p>Only then did that military officer come out, still holding a whip in his hand. He glared and shouted, "What are you crying about? I haven't even used the whip to beat them, that's already letting them off easy. Tell you honestly, if you don't hand over the grain, I won't let them down." That family knelt on the ground, and there was a man who was a bit smarter than us. He said that the family really didn't have any grain, and they had always lived on grass roots. Unless they waited for the newly planted wheat in our fields to be harvested, they could hand it over then. That military officer had never shown a smile to us, but upon hearing this, his face suddenly brightened up and he smiled. He pointed at us with the whip and said, "You said this yourself. Can you provide a guarantee?" We originally didn't know what "providing a guarantee" meant. Later, the military officer said, "Providing a guarantee means writing a note." We couldn't write, so he could write it for us. Once it was written, we just needed to put a fingerprint on it. This wasn't difficult, so we agreed. He immediately took out a piece of paper, let down the people who were hanging, called the soldiers to bring an inkstone, grabbed a person's finger, pressed it in the inkstone, and then pressed it on the paper. He said it was all done, and released my father. But my father couldn't walk on his own; the people from the fortress carried him back. We were all fools, thinking that this meant the big problem was over. My father slept for a night, recovered his breath, and, thinking about the wheat in the field that could be harvested in a day or two, got up early to check on it. Unexpectedly, that piece of land's wheat had already been completely harvested. Several soldiers, carrying bundles of wheat, were carrying them away on shoulder poles. My father... my father..." He choked up at this point. (353)</p>
<h3 id="e200">Record of Lingering Fragrance <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" After a while, she struggled to say, "Don't talk nonsense! This is clearly a terrible omen. Who are you trying to deceive? You clearly know it's an omen, so why are you turning it upside down and saying the opposite? Do you think I don't know? Hmph! Only a three-year-old child would take it as a good omen!"</p>
<p>Although the Empress Dowager said these few words very softly, her tone was very angry and intense. After speaking, she fiercely waved her right hand outward, meaning to tell Li Lianying to leave immediately. Li Lianying couldn't have been happier to do so, so as to avoid being scolded unnecessarily, and hurriedly kowtowed and went out.</p>
<p>Then the Empress Dowager turned around and said to me:</p>
<p>"Don't laugh at us for being timid! This flower does have a somewhat eerie aura. Perhaps some disaster is about to befall us, or our country!" She said to me in a whisper; her attitude was still very solemn, and her eyebrows were almost knitted together.</p>
<p>At that time, listening to her say that so softly, I gradually began to believe it too. I myself absolutely did not believe in any good or bad omens, and her words could not change my belief. It was only because I had followed her for so many days that I had deeply experienced how great the power she possessed was. Since she already possessed such great power and was so deeply superstitious about good and bad omens, wasn't it possible that she herself would create a disaster because of that magnolia flower? Therefore, the Empress Dowager was worried about a disaster because of her superstition about omens, and I was worried that a disaster would really occur because of my belief in her power. Although we were both worried, our psychology was different. (449)</p>

<h3 id="e201">Roscoe's Private Life <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Since the American slapstick star Roscoe gave us a rather bad impression with his film "Never Say Die," his works have not come to China for a long time. Perhaps he is taking a full rest these past few years and doesn't have any new works? But Roscoe's past achievements are still unforgettable to us. Now I will talk about his private life as a topic of conversation after tea and dinner.</p>
<p>Roscoe's real name is Harold Lloyd. He is a simple and modest person. His wife, Mildred Davis, was the female lead in many of his previous films. They have been married for many years and are still as loving as ever, and they already have very cute children. In the films, he always wears black-rimmed glasses, but as soon as he leaves the studio, he takes off his glasses. He never wears glasses in his daily life. He likes to work, loves fame, and loves money, but he especially loves his family. Except for work, he puts all his energy into his wife and children.</p>
<p>He has starred in 350 films and earned a lot of money, making him one of the richest stars in Hollywood. However, he is very thrifty and invests wisely in various businesses, never failing. He was very poor before, so he knows that money doesn't come easily, so he never wastes it. His greatest luxury is his house, which has a twenty-acre garden and a swimming pool and a golf course. The house is large and magnificent, decorated to the utmost beauty, truly like a palace from a myth. Just because the house and garden are so large, he has to hire many servants, so he has eighteen gardeners, a chauffeur, and more than ten male and female servants. Seeing that he has so many servants, you would think he is very extravagant. But in fact, he is very shrewd. If the meat delivered from the butcher shop is a little short, he will protest. He also knows exactly how many eggs his family eats. All the bills are managed by a secretary, but he checks them himself every month. If there are any discrepancies, he will definitely ask about them in detail. He pays all the bills every month and never delays, even if it's just a penny or two. He also records them. If the prices of food and other daily necessities change and differ from the bills, he must know the reason. Roscoe himself stipulates a weekly allowance of one hundred gold dollars and never exceeds this amount. There are also regulations for the expenses of his wife and children.</p>
<p>Roscoe likes a quiet life and never holds grand banquets. He is never seen in the extravagant social circles of Hollywood. But he never participates in gambling, boat races, or polo either. His wife is as simple as he is and does not care about dressing up. She does not associate with the fashionable female stars of Hollywood but quietly lives her peaceful family life. Roscoe's family all love flowers, but they are not willing to spend too much money. The flowers they use are all grown in their own garden, and sometimes they buy a batch from the flower shop wholesale, which is very cheap. When they entertain relatives and friends, they just eat a simple meal, chat for a while, or play a game of mahjong without betting, and that's how they spend an evening. Roscoe and his wife often play tennis and golf as their daily exercise. Every summer, Roscoe's wife and children often wear swimsuits and swim in the swimming pool.</p>
<p>Their children, a son named Harold Jr., and a daughter named Gloria, also have a foster daughter named Punchy, who are all well-behaved and docile children. Roscoe's wife often gives them strict family education and does not let up. They each have a fixed amount of allowance every month. If they want to buy new toys but have already spent their allowance for the month, they have to wait until next month to buy them, and there is no flexibility. Although the two daughters are young, Roscoe's wife has already taught them sewing and cooking, and also has them make their beds, to make them useful citizens in the future. They usually call their mother "Med," which is different from calling her "Mama." But Med is now completely different from when she played the female lead in her husband's films. Her golden hair and blue eyes have not changed, but she has become a sophisticated and thoughtful woman. She only thinks about her husband and children, is gentle and considerate, and truly cares for them in every possible way. She is truly a model of a virtuous wife and loving mother in Hollywood.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Finance: Speculation Sets New Price Again: 1183 Yuan; Foreign Exchange Ignites Buying Spree, Rise of 35.8 Yuan <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Although the gold market rose sharply yesterday, it was still less impressive compared to the foreign exchange market. The situation seems to be returning to normal. Banks are scrambling for US dollars, Qiao Zhaofu is making every effort to settle pound sterling, the domestic market is unusually tight, and the gold price has reached a new peak of 1183 yuan. However, buyers seem to have the intention of suppressing the rise, so the gold price is only about ten yuan higher than the US dollar, which is much more peaceful than the previous day's rise of 150 yuan. Early in the morning, due to the decline in the overseas silver market in England and the stability in the US, deferred silver prices were unchanged or reduced by 2.5%. Exchange rates rose, and London raw gold fell by 1.5 pence. People's hearts were optimistic. Off-market preliminary trading opened, rising from 45.6 yuan to 56.7 yuan.

The HSBC posted rates were changed to a decline of 0.375 and 0.75, breaking through the 80 yuan mark, creating a new high price of 1183 yuan.

The market price fluctuated between 71 and 82 yuan. Finally, with the domestic market easing, it was easy to fall and difficult to rise. The Indian silver prediction was slightly six annas.

Banks sold US dollars and bought pounds. The upper market was good. Jiaotong and Xingye even scrambled for US dollars. The HSBC Bank's posted rates announced a decline of 0.625 for the pound and 1.3125 for the US dollar. People's hearts were greatly boosted, and banks scrambled. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu stubbornly scrambled for pound sterling, and it was difficult for Chinese merchants to settle. Therefore, demand exceeded supply, and the process suddenly became tight. Although there was supply at high prices midway, it was also too little for too many monks. Banks' appetite never waned. Foreign firms were also eager to settle. The HSBC Bank's posted rates were changed to a decline of 0.375 and 0.75, and the process became even tighter. Chinese merchants supplied at high prices. Although it was tight afterward and tended to be illusory, the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu was still scrambling. It was predicted that Indian silver would fall by six annas. Although it was firm at noon, it was still easy to maintain. At the closing, the near-term selling price was 1 shilling 3.73125 pence for the pound and 31.375 yuan for the US dollar, a tightening of half a penny for the pound and 0.9375 for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese banks continued to settle, and foreign banks also settled deferred US dollars. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu stubbornly scrambled for November pound sterling, and foreign firms also settled. Chinese merchants wanted to scramble but found it difficult to find an opponent, and they had to settle by rolling over, and the US dollar arbitrage against speculation gold had already risen by more than 40 yuan, retreating to a rise of just over 10 yuan. The transaction prices for the first half of the day are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e204">The Last Period of October Ends Today, Very Different from the April Period <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial world underwent a huge change due to the head cutting and water adding, and people were panicked. They hardly had time to consider long-term settlements. According to surveys, Huayin Bank owed more than 5,540,000 in long-term loans, and its long-term deposits were more than 1,220,000. Money shops owed more than 6,000,000 in long-term loans, and their long-term deposits were around 2,000,000. In addition, Yongzhuang Bulis owed more than 2,000,000 in long-term loans. Generally, they were all transferred. It was heard that depositors still wanted to collect and re-lend, but in the end, they were forced to transfer for six months or reduce the amount. Therefore, yesterday's settlement was very smooth. As for the various extreme difference funds that should be paid on some speculative businesses, the amount was also considerable. However, they were burdened by the financial world's handling of the verification and settlement procedures, and they were also busy with the tenth period, so they were unable to settle it for a while. Generally, they requested to handle it on Monday, October. However, the banks on the Bund also agreed to temporarily accommodate them. If so, the settlement of this amount seems to be delayed. The tenth period is only one day away (31st). But it is hoped that it will pass peacefully. Recalling the last period (the April situation was originally difficult, the head cutting and water adding in May and June did indeed reach 0.5 or 0.6, but never reached the top of 0.7. Although there were also large-scale transfers of long-term contracts from the outside world, they never saw a full transfer. Therefore, comparing the two, today is very different from the past.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Silver Rushes to Banks on the Bund; Exchange Rates Soar to 70 Cents with Surcharges; Rumors of a Shortfall of Two to Three Million Dollars <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Due to numerous current affairs difficulties and commercial fatigue, coupled with the fact that it is the end of the month and most are looking to cover deficits, and especially because foreign banks on the Bund have sold a large quantity of government bonds, with proceeds of over ten million dollars due, mainly for yesterday's receipts, and with many rushing to settle exchange rate differences, exorbitantly high prices were seen yesterday. The morning opened at 32 cents with surcharges, then quickly rose to 40 cents, then 60 cents, then 70 cents. However, 70 cents is the upper limit set by industry regulations and could not go higher, but demand remained strong, resulting in a significant shortfall, estimated at two to three million dollars, likely unable to be covered last night. Foreign call loans also increased to 2 cents, totaling 17 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets. Due to credit concerns, there has been little activity in call loan transactions recently, so yesterday morning's transfer amount was only slightly over 2.6 million, with new transactions over 700,000. Afternoon market transactions were over 400,000, small general association transactions were over 1.3 million, foreign pledges taken were over 900,000, new loans made were over 600,000, banknotes withdrawn were over 1.4 million, banknotes issued into circulation were over 900,000, and unmarked bills were over 300,000.

Money shops cleared over 45.5 million in foreign public bonds, over 1.28 million in foreign surcharges, over 800,000 in various remittances, 100,000 in customer funds, 400,000 in silver, 500,000 in banknotes, and 1.4 million in cash.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the morning and afternoon prices for small Jiangnan silver were 824 yuan, 14 yuan lower than the previous day, with 3,000 jiao transacted in the morning and 1,500 jiao in the afternoon. The morning price for small Guangdong silver was 766.9 yuan, and the afternoon price was 666.55 yuan, 1 jiao lower than the previous day, with 140,000 jiao transacted in the morning and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e206">Securities: December Futures Enter the Market; Bullish Sentiment Sweeps the Bond Market; Prices Rise Several Jiao to 1.8 Yuan; 96 Bonds Once Reached 17.5 Yuan <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, December futures began trading, and the market remained extremely active. Bullish investors continued to push up prices, with large purchases from Northern groups and Number 48. Generally relying on inflation and currency devaluation, they continuously bought long positions to raise market prices. Prices were repeatedly raised, with increases ranging from 7 to 9 yuan from the lowest prices. The frenzied rise of 96 bonds was particularly unreasonable, and the speculative fever was the highest this year. However, with long positions not exiting, market prices are expected to continue to rise. Yesterday, initial bids for demobilization bonds were only slightly over 2 jiao, but they immediately rose more than 5 jiao. 19 Customs, Good Customs 20 bonds, 10 Customs, etc., only rose around 1 jiao. Starting with the Consolidated Tax, bullish investors bravely raised prices by another 6 jiao. Subsequently, the increases became more intense, with Government Six rising by 1.45 yuan and 96 bonds rising by 1.4 yuan. Although November contracts were making their initial appearance, they also opened higher. Second-round demobilization bonds rose by 1.2 yuan. Later, sellers from Upper Six became more active, and Number 48 also slightly reduced their long positions. The bullish momentum gradually weakened, and 20 Customs bonds rose by 5 to 6 jiao. Starting with the Consolidated Tax, prices uniformly weakened, falling slightly from 1 jiao to 6 jiao. The price of 96 bonds ranged from a 1.5 to a 4.5 jiao increase. Market prices, within the scope of human influence, no longer had a clear trend. In the afternoon, only one round of trading occurred, with slight signs of weakness in previous contracts, falling slightly from 1 jiao to 3 jiao. Starting with 20 Customs, bullish sentiment returned, with Number 47, 33, and 78 being the most enthusiastic buyers. The bullish momentum intensified, with Gold bonds rising sharply by 1.8 yuan and 96 bonds continuing to rise by 1.1 yuan, reaching a new high of 17.5 yuan. With various groups entering the market, the bullish momentum is still growing, and market prices are expected to continue to rise. The resulting price increases ranged from several jiao to 2.8 yuan, with 96 bonds rising by another 2.75 yuan. The total volume of transactions was approximately 30 million yuan. The resulting price increases and decreases compared to the previous day are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

Gold, entertainment, and utility stocks performed well. Automobile stocks still saw some profit-taking. The bond market was calm, and small exchange stocks were sluggish, with prices mixed but firm. The total daily trading volume was 1.71 million shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed below:</p>

<p>The October Gold Rooster Yarn contract was listed on May 1st at 179.4 yuan. At this time, Shanghai was experiencing a turbulent financial crisis, with banks and money shops successively collapsing. The situation in North China was also serious, and the market gradually declined, reaching a low of 165.3 yuan on June 18th. However, yarn factories were affected by operational difficulties, with many suspending operations or reducing working hours, leading to a daily decrease in production. Marker prices rose, and rumors spread throughout the market, revisiting the issue of inflation. Furthermore, there was the organization of long-term trading companies and large-scale purchases. Market prices gradually increased, soaring by 4 yuan in one day on July 29th, reaching a high of 179.4 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the high prices, actual demand stagnated, and market sentiment turned sharply downward, breaking the 70 yuan mark. Subsequently, with the recent surge in gold prices and intense rumors about the paper money issue, coupled with the sharp decline in Shanghai's yarn inventory, market sentiment became agitated, reaching a high of 182.5 yuan. As a result, 4,050 bales remained, with the three-day delivery price being 580 yuan. The actual delivered yarn totaled 1,000 bales of Double Deer 20 count, 50 bales of Red Kui, and 200 bales of Earth, totaling 1,250 bales. The remainder was self-delivered. The names and quantities of the receiving and delivering brokers are listed below (unit: bales):</p>

<p>The October cotton contract was listed on May 1st of this year, priced at 33.55 yuan. At this time, the local cotton inventory was sufficient, the silver market was strangely tight, market sentiment was uneasy, and the yarn market was sluggish, reaching a low of 30.75 yuan on June 18th. Subsequently, severe floods occurred in various regions, inundating cotton fields in Hubei province, expanding the scope of damage. Speculators rushed to buy, and market prices turned from weak to strong, reaching a high of 35.1 yuan on July 29th. By autumn, the weather was clear, and cotton fields in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were lush. Although local conditions were bad, they could be remedied. Various groups gradually entered the market, with the Ningbo group suddenly launching a strong selling effort, selling over 100,000 dan, putting significant pressure on market prices. At the same time, the US cotton loan government announced a change from 12 cents to 9 cents, shaking market sentiment, and impacting the global cotton industry. Low prices reached 31.2 yuan. Although the supply of Tonghua and Yaohua cotton surged, factory purchases remained robust. Subsequently, with the recent surge in marker orders, prices reached 35.4 yuan. The resulting quantity was 34,600 zu, with actual delivery being 13,000 zu. The delivered goods were Huoji, Yaohua, Tonghua, and Taicang cotton. The three-day delivery price was 34.5 yuan, with the remainder being self-delivered. The names and quantities of the receiving and delivering brokers are listed below (unit: dan):</p>

<h3 id="e209">Special Margin Increased for Yarn and Cotton Trading; Yarn and Cotton Each Collect 16 Yuan Per Bale/Dan <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange's standard yarn and cotton market has been affected by the surge in gold prices, with market prices rising and falling sharply in recent days. Speculators' minds are frenzied. To avoid danger, the Exchange has increased the special margin for yarn and cotton trading, with a cash deposit of 8 yuan per bale of yarn and 3 yuan per dan of cotton. Starting today, cotton yarn will be further increased by 8 yuan per bale, bringing the total to 16 yuan. Cotton will be increased by 3 yuan, bringing the total to 6 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Spot Yarn Trading is Quite Active <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Standard yarn and cotton trading has been suspended because of the end-of-month delivery procedures; the market has stopped assembling. However, spot yarn merchants still operate in the market, and the market is unusually strong. Because marker prices have repeatedly reached new highs, market sentiment is becoming more frenzied. It is expected that there will be another round of intense price increases in marker yarn today. Statistics show that 1,186 bales of spot yarn were traded by various groups, with prices up 2 yuan for yarn and 4 yuan for thread. In the afternoon, spot yarn prices were called 3 to 4 yuan higher, but transactions were slightly sparse. Purchase amounts for each region are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 185; Guangdong: 40</p>
<p>Sichuan: 900; Jiangxi: 30</p>
<p>Ningbo: 1; Nanjing: 5</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with sluggish conditions. Prices fell by 1 to 3 points due to hedge selling of cotton and a weak wheat market. Subsequently, trading houses and Liverpool groups made purchases, and a slight rebound was seen. However, Liverpool heavily sold October of next year. There were few outside trades, and trading houses remained on the sidelines. Halfway through the session, rumors that cotton storage facilities and cooperatives would move December contracts to October of next year caused market volatility. Leading up to the close, short positions were covered. Spot cotton basis was very firm, mostly to offset old positions; new orders were lacking. As a result, old cotton was unchanged but rose 71 points, October contracts fell 10 points, and spot prices rose 10 points. English cotton spot prices fell 2 points, and futures rose 1 to 6 points. Indian cotton saw profit-taking by retail investors, and the market was quiet. The closing prices are recorded below (29th telegram):</p>

<h3 id="e212">Grains: Distant Flour Breaks the 3 Yuan Barrier <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market experienced another strong surge. This level of increase is the highest since the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, and it is also the highest price seen in two or three years. Morning opening prices were driven by an increase of 40 cents in Chicago and about 90 cents in Canada. The soaring gold price also rose by dozens of yuan daily, leading to agitated market sentiment that reached a boiling point. Opening prices for all months initially rose by 2 to 3 cents, followed by increasingly strong buying, with successive increases of 3 to 4 cents. Contracts for January and earlier all broke through the 3 yuan barrier. In the afternoon, opening prices rose even more dramatically, soaring by 3 to 8 cents, due to rumors of a reduction in the fineness of the currency and the imminent implementation of currency inflation. The market became exceptionally chaotic. The highest prices were: the current month reached 2.93 yuan, November reached 2.98 yuan, December reached 3.03 yuan, January reached 3.0775 yuan, February reached 3.08 yuan, and March reached 3.0825 yuan, a surge of 10 to 16 cents compared to the previous day's close. After the second round, the exchange cracked down on speculation, strictly collecting margin and forcing payment of security deposits, causing speculators to sell off positions. Distant contracts fell by 6 to 7 cents compared to the opening price. Subsequently, trading calmed down somewhat, and the market stabilized. It is incomprehensible that the government has not provided any relief despite the market reaching this point.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Near and Distant Wheat Both Break 5 Yuan—Except for November Contracts— <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw continued sharp rises across all months in the morning. Because ocean wheat prices rose by 40 to 50 cents and gold prices reached new highs, the market saw a general increase of around 10 cents, even though trading was not very active after the opening. In the afternoon, opening prices continued to rise by 5 to 6 cents due to the alarming rise in flour prices. November contracts reached 4.95 yuan, December reached 5.08 yuan, January reached 5.13 yuan, and February reached 5.14 yuan. After the first round, due to the sharp drop in flour prices, market sentiment became unstable. December contracts inexplicably fell by 8 cents, and others also fell by 3 to 5 cents. In the spot wheat market, floor flour wheat was good, and called prices were all 3 to 5 cents higher. Shandong wheat opened at 4.71 yuan, followed by 70 cents. Zhangbaling wheat was 4.68 yuan, Hankou wheat was 4.60 yuan, and Liuhe wheat was 4.61 yuan. Fuxin sold 3,500 bags, and Xinda sold 500 bags.</p>

<p>Overseas wheat market conditions: Canadian wheat exports were clear, and the Winnipeg market became firm. Chicago was affected and rebounded, but higher prices still require increased global demand.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Over 30 ships arrived yesterday, and the market was stable. Medium-grade goods were slightly soft, but Tongli goods seemed to have a fresh look. There were over 500 bags of Bao Wei made open, over 400 bags of new japonica rice, and zero orders were not enthusiastic. Except for negative yuan except for jiao, the rest were not opened.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 23 or 24 ships arrived from various routes in Hexia. New japonica retail sales in the market were normal, broken japonica retail disassembly was cold and shallow, and the price trend was stable. Dozens of stones of Jiashan negative yuan newly arrived, and the rice quality was very good, with prices opening at 9.3 yuan. Duyang and Jianbu Jian rice sales continued to move, and the price trend was stable. Custom tip retail sales were slightly active, and the market was stable. Only a few white yuan goods arrived, and sales to stores and wineries were slightly higher, with prices tight beyond the jiao. The rest of the goods had little ups and downs.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Miscellaneous Grains Trade is Unusually Brisk <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The miscellaneous grains sales market is not weak. Yesterday, the market traded a total of over 5,000 bags of various yellow soybeans, 1,300 to 1,400 bags of various spot sesames, and merchants handled 2,000 bags of foreign cleaned goods, priced at 10.15 yuan. 450 bags of broad beans, 500 bags of red beans, and other miscellaneous grains also traded in lots of 100 bags.</p>
<p>Storing Households Actively Handle Guest Rice, Selling Prices Rise Again by 10 to 11 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was very active, especially with the currency issue attracting attention from all parties. Therefore, storing households tried their best to actively purchase, and the purchase intention was extremely greedy. Local guest rice sales were also inquired about. Storing households paid more attention to Gan and Han guest rice, purchasing over 3,000 bags. Northern merchants also purchased 1,500 bags of Yong rice, and this street purchased over 1,000 bags of Gan rice, 1,000 bags of Anqing rice, and over 2,500 bags of Yong, Han, Wenzhou, and Taiwan rice. Statistics show that over 9,000 bags were traded, and prices rose by 10, 11, and 12 cents compared to the previous market. Foreign rice attracted a lot of attention from storing households, but agents did not sell it, and there was only a small amount of rice returning to the market, so the market also increased by nearly a jiao. Statistics show that 300 bags of Saigon, 220 bags of Small Twisted, and 200 bags of Siamese Yuan rice were all handled by this street.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Bran Prices Also See Increases <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Bran prices have risen in recent days along with gold prices. Due to external relations and the step by step rise in the prices of various goods, price reductions have also increased sharply. Fuxin bran has already been called up to 2.9 yuan, and Fufeng bran is at 2.75 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Silk and Tea: Needle and Eyebrow Green Tea European Sales Rebound <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, high-grade eyebrow green teas from Wuyuan and Tunxi rebounded in European sales. British and French merchants, seeing the current low tea prices and the shrinking exchange rate, seized the opportunity to hoard. The whole city bought high grade teas, like precious eyebrow, needle eyebrow, elegant eyebrow, offering happiness from foreign firms like Jinlong, Tongfu, Yongxing, Huacha for a total of 1,500 boxes. The market was extremely firm. High-grade ball tea sales were most active, but the market lacked inventory, making it difficult to meet demand. In addition, Qimen black tea has also become active again due to expensive gold and cheap silver.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Lower Grade Silk Opens at 500 Yuan <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Recently, overseas prices have fallen slightly (Yokohama is down 30 yuan from yesterday), but the Shanghai silk market remains firm. Transactions of white silk are rare. It is rumored that domestic silk factories are substituting with Qili silk due to the high price of the silk factory. In recent days the price of Qili silk has also been high. Even lower grade silks, such as the Golden Horse brand, opened at a new high of 500 yuan yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, marker prices soared to 1,180 yuan, and foreign exchange rates shrank wildly due to various rumors. The cost of various goods has increased significantly in an intangible way. Local industry members are concerned about their interests and are forced to raise selling prices. Prices for various goods are 5 to 6 jiao to 2 to 3 yuan higher than the previous day. According to the observations of those holding goods, there is a great desire to hoard and speculate, and they are unwilling to easily sell. Therefore, the actual transactions in the market are very quiet, but the sound of rising prices is spreading throughout the city.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Raw and White Granulated Sugar Exhibits New High Prices—Reaching 20.3 Yuan—Trading is Particularly Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was very tense because customs duties were especially high, with a listed price of 2,091 and a settlement price of 2,155. The guild's price list shows that spot 24 raw and white granulated sugar suddenly rose by 6.5 jiao, breaking through the 20 yuan mark, with transactions at 20.3 yuan, which can be said to be the highest new record this year.

<h3 id="e220">On the Nature of Comedy and "The Inspector General" <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Traveler from Okayama</p>
<p>Most people tend to easily misunderstand comedy (Comedy), thinking that comedy is just something that makes people laugh. However, the essence of comedy is not that simple. If the meaning of comedy is really just about making people laugh and "moving away from reality, losing its vivid content," then this kind of drama has completely lost its fundamental meaning! It has simply become a game!" (Belinsky). Therefore, Gogol fervently said: "Is theater actually manufacturing toys to coax children?!"</p>
<p>When the European stage of the 19th century was almost completely occupied by unrealistic melodrama and vaudeville, Gogol once protested loudly: "Melodrama and vaudeville have dominated the world of drama for five years! What an ugly sight!... If a genius with authority could sweep away this miasma, then the whole world would place him alongside Byron. This is not a humorous statement, because in this effort there is considerable comfort. Alexandre Dumas and other masters have become legislators for the whole world. I dare to swear that this is really the shame of these five years of the nineteenth century! Oh, Molière, the great Molière, it is you who have broadly developed all characters, even the shadows of characters! You, the strict, deeply thoughtful Racine, you are the one who, in the world of poetry, illuminates the value of humanity with noble enthusiasm. Please look at what is popular on our stage after you? Look, what a terrible monster—the ugliness of melodrama—is wandering among us! Where exactly are we living? Where are we, with all the modern troubles and unfathomable uncertainties? We can't even find a little reflection of ourselves in melodrama, but our melodrama is utterly unscrupulous, with nothing but lies... "</p>
<p>The melodrama and vaudeville of that era were completely terrifying, absurd dramas. The dialogue contained so-called satire, but it had no connection to living reality. This kind of drama turned the theater, which should be "a forum for civic education and moral instruction," into "a useless place of entertainment"! Therefore, Gogol "bitterly attacked playwrights for stuffing works with no connection to real life into the repertoire." Gogol believed that the greatest danger harming the essence of drama lies in the misinterpretation of comedic characters, that is, perceiving the characters in the play as amusing entertainment. Gogol said: "Laughter is more important and deeper than people imagine. It is by no means laughter that is provided for entertainment due to momentary stimuli and arising from an unhealthy temperament. Rather, it is laughter that bursts forth from people's honest nature... If someone does something base and trivial, and a terrifying, satirical force is displayed before him, but he pretends and shouts: 'There is no such person!' This shows that his understanding is more critical than others." This kind of healthy laughter is precisely contained in Gogol's works. From novels and dramas such as "The Inspector General," "The Overcoat," and "Dead Souls," he enables people to find some real, typical characters in real society. These characters, under his pen, become deeply recognized and familiar to everyone, perhaps those bureaucrats, local tyrants, landlords, and village chiefs who grow up around them...</p>
<p>Belinsky said: "Comedy is absolutely not comical, it is the same kind of thing as tragedy. In essence, comedy and tragedy are only one step apart. In the depths of comedic laughter, there also lies the secret tear that constitutes the power of tragedy. This laughter arises from the sharp insight into everything decadent, base, and that destroys humanity. Because the humor of the licentious will eventually fall into ruin and depression. If this kind of depression does not exist for people, then comedy will not exist either. That kind of vulgar teasing, that kind of laughter that loses its true content, and the clown's nonsense are all not comedy. True comedy contains the same noble meaning as tragedy, and occupies an equal position and value in the theatrical world. Comedy is not a farce that uses stupid things to please the audience. Like tragedy, it is the mysterious posture of human nature, the cry of humanity." This passage provides a concise and essential explanation of the nature of comedy. And Gogol and his drama permeate from this "secret tear." His "Inspector General" exposes the general incompetence and flattery of bureaucrats. Belinsky said: "This comedy contains a very deep observation of real society, and laughter that bursts forth from the heart." Moreover, "due to these two forces, it can give people an unprecedentedly profound impression. For this reason, the appearance of Gogol's "Inspector General" received severe attacks from the conservative society at the time. However, these attacks still could not destroy the extremely important role of Gogol's realistic satirical works in Russian literature. They left a magnificent impact in the Nicholas Dynasty of the nineteenth century, laying a solid foundation for realism in Russia.</p>
<p>The appearance of "The Inspector General" made people recognize Gogol's great genius for drama. He, like Molière, "began his career as a comedic writer with laughter full of boisterous, healthy joy." Molière "overcame farce and burlesque with comedies of social psychology, thereby creating comedic types corresponding to his own class, and thus also creating comedic types that could serve as models for civic comedies in other countries" (Fritz Mauthner). Gogol developed a great affection for Molière, but his "Inspector General" was completed under the encouragement of Pushkin. However, he did not go so far as to say, as was mistakenly rumored outside, that "Pushkin told him this story" (Li Zegang: "European Modern Literature," page 205). Because from Gogol's keen observation, his loyalty to objective realism is not surprising. Regarding Gogol's works, as Pushkin said, "Gogol didn't fabricate anything. This is pure truth, terrible truth!" This "terrible truth" is even "superior to Pushkin" (Belinsky).</p>
<p>Due to dissatisfaction with the initial performance of "The Inspector General" on stage, a fundamental struggle arose between Gogol and the theater. Gogol said: "The performance of "The Inspector General" was actually performed as something crude, simply unlike my work. The protagonist was a complete failure. [Actor Dür] who played the protagonist) did not understand even a hair of what Khlestakov ("The Inspector General"'s protagonist) was like. He actually played Khlestakov as a clown or a rogue who seemed to have come from a Parisian theater, wearing clothes from the second century and wearing makeup..." As a result of this struggle, Gogol won, so that: "In order to be able to fully unfold the rich content of that script to the audience, it was immediately felt that the theater and the actors needed a new and special attitude." Because actors accustomed to the vaudeville style would not understand the essence of comedy... After this, Gogol caused a qualitative change in the Russian theatrical world.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much religious mysticism Gogol's later years contained in discussions of drama, his "Inspector General" becoming the most brilliant play of nineteenth-century Russian drama is undeniable. Belinsky said: "Since Gogol's play appeared, one cannot read a better script or see a better performance." This is not an exaggeration.</p>
<h3 id="e221">By the Golden Thread Spring <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunqiao</p>
<p>I lived in Jinan for four or five years, almost entirely in poverty and busyness. Because of poverty, I had to be busy; the result of being busy was still poverty. In autumn, people were clamoring to go to Longdong to see the red leaves, and I myself was very willing to go and have some fun. Although I am a vulgar person, everyone needs entertainment. However, running there is impossible; the road is too far. Taking a car there is impossible; I don't have the money for a car. As a result, I went to Golden Thread Spring with a friend.</p>
<p>Golden Thread Spring, to the east of Baotu Spring, has a large gate with a plaque that says "Shangshu Hall." Going through this gate, you can find it. Inside the gate is a small courtyard. Through another gate is a drill ground. The sound of the windmill turning creaks rhythmically, often drowning out the noisy shouts. On the west side of the courtyard, there is a small garden.</p>
<p>The three of us entered the small garden. The cool autumn wind shook the leaves, shaking our sleeves. It was indeed desolate. It no longer had its former abundance, that fresh abundance.</p>
<p>There were not many people. In the middle of the courtyard, there is a water pavilion. It is surrounded by clear water. All this water flows from the northwest corner of the courtyard. That source is the Golden Thread Spring. The water flowing from the Golden Thread Spring mixes with the slow flow of the Jade Gargling Pool opposite and flows outside the wall.</p>
<p>The three of us sat on the rocks of the artificial mountain.</p>
<p>Tall trees, their branches and leaves intricately intertwined in the sky, made it impossible to see the high heavens of the north. I remember that in summer, the leaves were even denser. In spring, the fragrance of flowers and the songs of birds intoxicated the people of spring even more. Now, autumn has arrived, the season of "poets" has arrived. Some are going to Hangzhou to watch the tide, some are admiring the red leaves, some are suffering even more, and some are stealing even more leisure. In the grass pavilion in the southwest corner of the courtyard, two old men in their fifties or sixties were playing chess. We, too, were resting leisurely.</p>
<p>Staring at the pool of emerald green water, the "poet" inscribed poetic lines in his shorthand notebook. I don't remember it clearly, but it was probably describing this winding stream. He said that the water was as green as solidified grape juice, and it must be as sweet as rock candy. And the turning over of the fish in the water, he thought, was even more beautiful, so beautiful that he didn't have the right words to describe it. Another friend, Feng, was planning a painting. As for me, I had an indescribable taste, flooding like a tide in my heart.</p>
<p>On the bank of the pool, there were two tall banana trees. The fat, green leaves were still growing vigorously.</p>
<p>None of us had seen the golden thread connected to the Golden Thread Spring. I have also heard people say that it is easy to see in the morning and evening. The three of us did not encounter this opportunity. Then, we talked about the Jade Gargling Liquid. The Jade Gargling Pool was ordinary and had nothing to see. However, I heard that the Jade Gargling Pool was the former residence of the lyricist Li Qingzhao, and her famous Jade Gargling Lyrics were written here.</p>
<p>I don't know how many people like the Jade Gargling Lyrics, but the Jade Gargling Pool is dilapidated, like its owner, leaving only a name in history.</p>
<p>—Damn it, let's also make a pool and write a collection of poems!</p>
<p>—Damn it, let's also make a pool and create a painting!</p>
<p>The two of them ridiculed each other, writing black words and black lines in their notebooks with their pencils, muttering as if they didn't want anyone to hear, but also wanted people to hear. They constantly shook, measuring angles, and thinking about words. I looked at the two of them boredly and said:</p>
<p>—Let's scatter, folks. The poems written in this place can only decorate bookshelves. The paintings created in this place can only decorate living rooms. Let's say less!</p>
<p>The "poet" glared at me and said:</p>
<p>—You rest. You have to work tomorrow!</p>

<p>— Bai Chen</p>
<p>The ticket seller's eyes darted around, staring at the man. "Where to?"</p>
<p>The man took out the counted copper coins, "Great [Da] Ma Road, two tickets."</p>
<p>The woman glanced at the man, not responding.</p>
<p>"Gu..."</p>
<p>"Mud City Bridge...!"</p>
<p>A rush of people surged on. In the middle was a friend carrying a small leather suitcase, who rushed to the glass door and stopped. Opening the suitcase, he took out several packages of candy. He opened his mouth and shouted:</p>
<p>"Hey, gentlemen! Anyone want to eat cream chocolate candy? This is produced by Shanghai Dahua Candy Company. Due to the new opening to promote business, it is a special discount. Good stuff, cheap price, real cream chocolate, usually selling for two dimes a piece, today only selling for two cents. And buy five get one free. Two cents buys six candies..."</p>
<p>Several people turned to look at the road. Several people looked at the moving mouth.</p>
<p>The friend carrying the small suitcase was not embarrassed at all by the people who ignored him. He kept saying: "Gentlemen, want to try it? I have samples here..." He reached into the suitcase and pulled out many small paper packages.</p>
<p>The woman looked at the man, who curled his lip. "Advertising!" He turned away.</p>
<p>The small paper packages were distributed to the opposite side, "Everyone, please try it. It doesn't matter. The samples don't cost money. If you like it, please take care of my business."</p>
<p>Some of the opposite guests took them, some shook their heads.</p>
<p>"Try it, try it, gentlemen!" He said in a very polite voice, but his face was like carved wood.</p>
<p>The small paper packages came to this side. The woman glanced sideways. The man also glanced at it, half of his face still facing the window.</p>
<p>"Sir, try it..."</p>
<p>The first person shook his head. The second person also shook his head. The third person was naturally embarrassed not to shake his head. The fourth person—the man followed suit, and the woman quickly followed the man's lead.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, try it. It doesn't matter if you don't buy it."</p>
<p>That guy was really thick-skinned. Even though people shook their heads, he still threw the small paper packages at people—one package per person.</p>
<p>The man glared at the guy as if angrily. The woman secretly looked at the man.</p>
<p>The man's eyes were looking out the window, his left hand lightly touching the small paper package, then pinching and weighing it between his three fingers, not even looking at it. The woman followed the man's lead, but put it in the folds of her handkerchief.</p>
<p>"Which gentleman will take care of my business?..."</p>
<p>That guy stared at the woman. The woman turned to stare at the man. "Want to buy it for the child...?"</p>
<p>The man shook his head annoyedly, "No!" With a wave of his left hand, the paper package was taken into the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>The woman lowered her head and didn't speak.</p>
<p>The guy carrying the small suitcase put the candy back into the suitcase, closed it, and went to the other side. Silently, like a passenger on the bus.</p>
<p>Several people seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. The small third class was calm.</p>
<p>The man put his left hand and right hand together, with the back of his hand facing up, doing something. There was a slight sound of tearing paper. His eyes were looking at the opposite guest, and his left hand was brought to his mouth.</p>
<p>The woman turned her face to look, and the man's mouth was moving a little.</p>
<p>The woman understood and straightened her handkerchief. Slowly opening the small paper package, she stole a glance and saw a purplish-black thing. "Oh!... This is..." she thought.</p>
<p>Seeing two guests across the way also moving their mouths, she mustered up her courage: "I can't be wrong!" So her mouth moved slightly as well.</p>
<p>But who was that? Standing at the door was that guy carrying the small suitcase. With bulging eyes, he stared at her.</p>
<p>Her face turned red, and she lowered her head, tightly closing her mouth.</p>
<p>"Gu..."</p>
<p>The man nudged her with his elbow. "Get off."</p>
<p>Getting off the tram, she looked around and found that they had already crossed the Great Ma Road. She asked, "Where is this...?" It was only now that she thought of the candy in her mouth.</p>
<p>"Fourth Ma Road!"</p>
<p>"Ptooey!" She spat out a mouthful of saliva, red and red. "This kind of candy is bitter!" (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e225">Thoughts on Holding a Visiting Group for Suffering Children <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Mengruo</p>
<p>Everyone knows that with the holding of China's Children's Year, the children who enjoy happiness are limited to children from middle-class and above families. As for the children of most poor families, they are still excluded. You see, every time there is a children's gathering, those who act as children's representatives or dance the Grape Fairy on stage are always little brothers and sisters wearing beautiful new clothes. There are very few ragged suffering children. Of course, we cannot say that the people in charge do not allow these suffering children to participate, but because the suffering children do not have the opportunity to join in the fun.</p>
<p>This time, however, it is an exception. Suffering children also get to enjoy the happiness of Children's Year. Recently, the Municipal Children's Year Implementation Committee held a visiting group for suffering children, wanting to travel to Kunshan. Participants are limited to suffering children raised by various charitable organizations in Shanghai. It is expected that there will be eighty people from the Shanghai Orphanage, eighty people from the Jiangwan Ciyou Sanatorium of the China Relief and Mutual Aid Association, sixty people from the Poor People's Training Institute, sixty people from the Ciyou Training Institute of the Chinese Ciyou Association, and twenty people from the Huier Orphanage of the Zhabei Charitable Group. The purpose of the visit is Kunshan, traveling back and forth by Jinghu [Beijing-Shanghai] Railway train. The places to visit are Ma'anshan [Saddle Mountain], Public Sports Ground, Kunshan Park, Kunshan Farm, Huancheng [Circumferential] Road, and various suffering children's care institutions. It is also planned to hold a banquet for suffering children at the foot of Ma'anshan Mountain, with officials from the association and local party and government leaders participating and giving speeches. This move is not considered to be particularly beneficial to suffering children, but the significance is very good. At least it can express a little of the spirit of Children's Year, on the one hand, to make these three hundred suffering children who participate in the visiting group realize that they also have the right to enjoy the happiness of Children's Year, and on the other hand, to make the general public not dare to ignore the status of suffering children.</p>
<p>However, Children's Year has a greater responsibility for suffering children than this. Children's Year is Children's Year for all children in the country, not Children's Year for a small number of special-class children. The happiness that Children's Year bestows on suffering children should not be superficial, but real happiness. One trip is just giving them an opportunity for entertainment. How to improve their lives is what we must care about. Therefore, in the future, Children's Year's work should take on the heavy responsibility of education and upbringing for suffering children. Children belong to society and the country. Poor families do not have the ability to educate and raise children, so society must educate and raise them. We cannot forget them just because they are born poor. Suffering children are also the masters of the country, and the fate of the future country is placed on them.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Pacing <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Huazhi</p>
<p>After dinner, the child began to doze off by the table. Because he had eaten too much, I took his hand and asked him to learn from me and pace in the room. He leaned against me, walking slowly, while rubbing his sleepy eyelids with his other hand, looking so reluctant and unhappy. But after walking back and forth four or five times, his sleepiness ran away, so he threw off my hand and turned around mischievously, pacing with a full air, like a clown. Seeing this, my wife smiled and said to me, "He has learned your worried look. It's a pity he can't frown and stare at people with a terrible look. Otherwise, it would be exactly the same!"</p>
<p>I stopped like that, watching the child pacing. Usually, when I am surrounded by unresolved matters, I always turn my hands and pace; this has become a habit. But I can't see my own clownish appearance, swaying and swaying; the child sees it, and as soon as he has the opportunity to develop, he immediately imitates that appearance. I didn't want to leave this stain on his pure and bright heart, so I sternly scolded him, not allowing him to turn his hands over, not allowing him to sway like a clown. Although he cried, and my wife also blamed me for scolding him unreasonably, I felt relieved, as if I had saved a person; and I urged myself not to make that strange appearance again as an example to the child.</p>
<p>Of course, I wouldn't create that kind of appearance myself. I was infected by my father—this is not knowledge, not property. I want to get rid of this bad habit from my child's generation. This habit is not only "ugly," but also a depiction of my father's lifelong frustration. He died so depressed.</p>
<p>My father was an old scholar, who did not pass the imperial examination, which was his lifelong regret. Every time he failed and returned home, he would lock himself in the study, not allowing family members to enter, and not coming out himself, neglecting sleep and food to desperately study. My father was a learned man, and my grandmother loved him very much. Every time he had a fit of bookishness, only my grandmother could dissuade him. According to my grandmother, my father's appearance at that time was beautiful, hanging a book, swaying back and forth in the study, simply like a fool. At that time, my older brother was only two years old, and I was still in swaddling clothes, so of course I didn't see my father pacing. Even when my grandmother described that situation, we were still young. Seeing my grandmother laugh, we also laughed. We still couldn't guess an accurate picture of pacing. I witnessed my father pacing like a clown when my brother and I went to university—since the Qing Dynasty was overthrown and the imperial examination was abolished, my father decided to give up studying and go into business. However, it is so difficult for a scholar with a bookish air to share food with the cunning and deceitful merchants. And my father still valued reading so much that he insisted that we graduate from university. Since doing business failed, paying for our brothers' tuition became stretched; I witnessed my father pacing at this time. He locked his brows, turned his hands back, swayed back and forth, sometimes smoking cigarettes, not knowing that the end of the cigarette had burned his fingernails. Seeing my father's anxious state of being unable to cope, and not being able to share his worries, I followed my father and started pacing. The last time was when the manager of the store absconded, and we were forced to a dead end by the creditors. My father and I paced in the store all night; due to this change, my father died in depression. The image of that night cannot be erased from my memory. This pacing became a habit. The child saw it, and he paced the same way. I thought of my father's lifelong frustration and depression, and I was taking over my father's fate. Seeing the child pacing, I couldn't help but worry that this child was a third-generation victim!</p>
<h3 id="e227">International Balloon Race Record <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Shui Quan</p>
<p>The Gordon Bennett Cup International Balloon Race has been held for decades and is of great interest to the aviation community. The large silver cup was donated by the late American Gordon Bennett, hence the name. It was founded in 1894 and is held annually. Representatives from various countries participate, but only balloons manufactured in their own country are eligible. The criteria for winning are based on the balloon's ascent altitude, landing distance, and time spent in the air. The rules stipulate that any country that wins three consecutive years will permanently retain the cup. Since the competition began, various countries have had wins and losses. The United States had several consecutive wins twice, but was deprived of the third win by another country, which was a pity. In 1934 and 1935, Poland won the championship twice. This year was a critical juncture, and the competition was even more intense. As a result, Poland won again, winning three consecutive times, and thus permanently retained the cup. The Polish government prepared a new silver cup, and the competition will continue to be held from next year, with all rules remaining the same.</p>
<p>Seven countries participated. According to the rules, the competition venue should be held in the capital of the country that won the previous year. Therefore, this year's competition was held in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, on September 15. Seven countries participated, namely the United States, France, Germany, Belgium, New Zealand, Poland, and Switzerland. The venue was at the airfield. On that day, the President of Poland, Mościcki, ministers of various departments, and military attachés from various countries' embassies in Poland all attended to watch the competition. More than 100,000 people rushed to the event, which was very lively. The opening ceremony was held at 3:00 PM, and the President gave a speech. The competition began at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Thirteen balloons. A total of thirteen balloons participated in the competition. The exteriors were painted in various colors, bright and beautiful. Before taking off, each crew member made a three-minute radio broadcast speech. At exactly 4:00 PM, the first balloon ascended into the sky. Before long, the thirteen balloons took off one after another, floating in the air, flying farther and farther, as small as shooting stars, vaguely disappearing into the distance. At that time, military music played loudly, and the audience gradually dispersed.</p>
<p>Landing in Russian territory. The results of the competition were as follows: the first place was won by the Polonia balloon, piloted by Polish Colonel Panseński and his assistant Wisłocki, with a landing distance of more than 1,600 kilometers and an altitude of more than 1,000 miles, landing in the Volga River in Russian territory. The second place was also won by a Polish balloon named Warsaw, with a distance of 1,500 kilometers, landing near Mequisk in Russian territory. The third place was Belgium, the fourth place was Germany, the fifth place was Poland, the sixth place was New Zealand, the seventh place was France, the eighth place was also France, the ninth place was Belgium, the tenth place was Switzerland, the eleventh place was Germany, the twelfth place was Germany, and the American balloon Navy was last.</p>
<p>Prizes for the winners. In addition to the silver cup, the winners of the balloon race also receive cash prizes. The first place receives 10,000 Polish złoty, the second place 7,000 Polish złoty, the third place 4,000 Polish złoty, and the subsequent places receive 2,500, 1,500, 1,200, 1,000, and 800 Polish złoty respectively. The prizes were donated by Polish President Mościcki, the Minister of Communications, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of the Army.</p>
<p>Balloon Manufacturing. After Poland won three consecutive times, the Gordon Bennett Cup, which has been contested for nearly 50 years, is permanently owned by Poland, earning the highest international honor. According to observations by participants in the competition, Poland's victory is purely due to the excellence of its balloon manufacturing. It is generally believed that Poland should be the first to promote the science and sports use of balloons in the world. It is reported that Belgian scientist Professor Piccard once ascended into the stratosphere in a balloon for scientific exploration. He recently telegraphed to Warsaw, specifically ordering a new balloon for his re-exploration.</p>

<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>Copper-smith Zhang Siguan has been feeling depressed lately: the shop hasn't had any work for two months, and his wife's belly is growing bigger day by day, and she's about to give birth.</p>
<p>Looking at the three little children! Two boys and one girl! Playing at the door, his heart trembles: he can't even feed the three he already has, what will he do with another one? In this day and age, it's a sin for poor people to have children!</p>
<p>But what can he do? The fourth is coming soon. Siguan and his wife are not young anymore. They like children, but in the current situation, the father's responsibility makes him tremble. Looking at the three children he already has: hungry, thin, ragged, filthy, he feels like he has committed an indelible sin, and he is always filled with painful discomfort and apology.</p>
<p>It's my fault, it's my fault! Your "fate" is so bad, why did you have to be born into my family?</p>
<p>Sometimes, walking down the street, he peeks through the iron gate of a "well-equipped" small school, looking at those lively, lovely, and happy children, and he thinks of his three wild dog-like children at home: the eldest is eight years old, and he should be going to school too, like those other children, doing morning exercises, "One, two, three, four!", singing about little sparrows, jumping and laughing; but... but his own children are left to roam the streets all day long...</p>
<p>Then, his heart feels like it's being stabbed with a knife, he's depressed, tormented, desperately thinking, like he's gone mad.</p>
<p>But the neighbors on either side keep saying those hateful words to him, which, in his opinion, are simply like thorns, endless words:</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Siguan, your wife is full-term, congratulations on having a fat, healthy baby boy, treat us to some red eggs."</p>
<p>But Siguan feels a kind of unbearable humiliation: "Congratulations my ass! Having children in this day and age! Debt collectors! I can't feed them, I might as well take it to the orphanage after it's born."</p>
<p>The woman gets anxious when she hears this: "What are you saying? What are you talking about? Are you crazy? Are you really...?"</p>
<p>"What do you know! There's no work, and you still want to give birth like a sow! I can't feed it, do you understand!"</p>
<p>The woman starts to cry: "You heartless bastard! What are you saying! You have the heart to take the child to the orphanage, I'll sue you, I will, I'll... fight you! You wolf in sheep's clothing...!"</p>
<p>However, at night, when everyone is quiet, Siguan softly says to his wife: "Zhaodi, you have to understand me this time, I'm not that kind of person, I like children too. But, there's been no work for two months, if we send him to... there, maybe he'll have a better life! At least he won't starve to death. A Zhao, think about it, you have to understand me!"</p>
<p>The woman doesn't say anything, staring blankly at Siguan's face, and after a long while, she starts to sob...</p>
<p>And so, the days pass by one by one. Finally, one night. In the tossing and turning of labor pains, in the painful groans, with the help of the neighboring women, amidst the sounds of scissors and water, a new life is finally born into this world, with an endless stream of rebellious and angry, unskilled cries.</p>
<p>"It's a boy, congratulations!" they say.</p>
<p>Siguan's ears can't take these words anymore. "It's finally born," like a heavy burden has been lifted, he breathes a long-held breath; after everyone has left, he uses a brain devoid of sensation and a trembling hand to pick up the newborn child from the bed, says to the woman's head, "A Zhao, you have to understand me!" and then carries the child and rushes out into the dark street.</p>
<p>Outside, it's drizzling, and under the window, he hears the faint sound of the woman's weeping inside the house.</p>

<p>Opening paragraph "Yang Taizhen 1</p>
<p>A carefree emperor's attitude is extraordinary. Not asking about people's livelihood and national plans is difficult. Flute song and autumn, singing romantic songs. The Yang family has a daughter with a fairy-like appearance. Born with beauty, an extraordinary product. Once selected to enter the palace. Moderate slimness, doubly loved. A smile turns a hundred charms. Spring cold showers to the hot springs. Overwhelming the country, overwhelming the city, even more charming. From then on, she accompanies the banquet day and night. Completely forgetting the rumors in the court. Singing light songs and dancing beautifully, playing silk bamboo instruments. Indulging in drunkenness, sleeping under the moon, spending all the time recklessly. Never thinking. There are three thousand beauties in the harem. On the Qixi Festival, in the Palace of Eternal Life. No one gives a gift of a box of gold at midnight. The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd swear their oaths. The flowers bloom with peonies, urging the drums. At Chenxiang Pavilion, shoulder to shoulder. Suddenly the political situation changed, and the Yuyang rebellion began. The carriage ran towards Shu. Nine layers of city walls turned into dust and smoke. The army did not advance, really helpless. Helpless to break up before Ma Wei. Heaven and earth rotate, and the dragon chariot returns. The plank road heard the bells, bleak. Taizhen flower shadows are faint. Spring breeze and autumn rain, people are lonely. Winning the monarch's dream. This is originally. Yang Fei fell into the world to eliminate dust. Don't blame the present for being unconvinced. You must know that thin life belongs to beauty</p>

<p>Huang Ying, a member of the Yingyin Society, is already a dance girl in a mainland dance hall.</p>
<p>"Recent Events on the Singing Stage" Jingxianjun said that Aunt Long Legs Ma Xingtao bought a set of flannel suits on Wusong Road the other day, the value of which was only three and a half yuan. According to Ma Jun, because the female salesperson is a bit related to Jingxian, the news spread so quickly.</p>
<p>At the grand song contest held in the dance hall, there is a string of ten top singers, such as Xu Jian, Yan Hua, Yao Li, Yao Ying, Manli, Wen Xian, Yingying, etc., but who selected these ten top singers? Some people say: This is the singers' side business, so naturally they have to do a lot of publicity. Moreover, there are three "authentic" top singers in the front line, so what does it matter if they borrow some light?</p>
<p>A certain singer (one of the top three singers) is indeed from a servant girl background. This secret has been revealed by various newspapers several times. It is said that she has directly negotiated with a certain reporter. The location is in a certain dance hall. (Above Dagong)</p>
<p>Miss Ma Tingting, formerly of the Starlight Society, has had a smooth journey since she went to sea to accompany dancing. She is now very popular in the Good Friends Dance Hall. Although Miss Ma is a singer who has gone to sea, she has a very good dance girl type. The Mainland Society is the incarnation of the Qiyin Society. It is currently recruiting male and female members. All those who join must pay a monthly fee of four corners of the ocean. This is really whimsical. If there are 100 members recruited, wouldn't there be a monthly income of 40 yuan of the ocean?</p>
<p>Li Ying said that she had already withdrawn from the Hongguang Qiyin Er Society.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Qi, the president of the Jiyin Society, has recently been asking people who Yin Yu is (according to a broadcasting machine" news, Yin Yu was run over by a car the other day and entered a certain hospital on Haige Road. Mr. Xu Qi can start from this path. Editor) (Above Baixue)</p>
<p>The 31st issue of the Dianyin Weekly has been published. The content is dedicated to news from the film and broadcasting industries. It is extremely exciting and also includes a joint program schedule of radio stations. A trial reading is attached with a postal fee of two cents. One corner per month.

<p>—Xia Peizhen Publicly Accompanies Dancing—</p>
<p>This is a "stimulating" piece of news, belonging to Shanghai friends who love stimulation!</p>
<p>The New Light Grand Theater will premiere the sound film "Little Aunt" produced by Kuaihuo Lin Company, starring Xia Peizhen. At the same time as the premiere of this film, there will also be a "short and concise" interesting drama called "Country Girl Coronation Ceremony", giving you a free gift for one and a half hours.</p>
<p>In this short drama, in addition to the full fun, it is said that it also has a lot of satirical meaning. This satire is said to be aimed at a certain coronation ceremony and a certain character. Xia Peizhen has always been called "Country Girl". She will personally appear on stage to play the "Country Girl" who is crowned, but, in addition to this "Country Girl", you should think of another "Country Girl" who is crowned. This will not be discussed here.</p>
<p>In the performance of this "funny drama", Xia Peizhen, after being crowned, can publicly accompany dancing. In addition to some dancers on stage, the audience below can also go up to invite dancing. And among these dancers, there is also a character hidden in the drama. This is a "Country Old Man", played by the comedian Zhao Tushan, who has a face like Han Langen but completely different acting skills. This "Country Old Man" also has a very interesting and satirical line, wait and see.</p>
<p>This "gimmick" should be very fresh, right?</p>

<p>—Nanjing Screening</p>
<h3 id="e236">"Wedding Night" Starts Auspiciously <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>After the "escape" of the rough-lined director Yue Feng, his new work "Wedding Night", after months of careful preparation, officially started work yesterday.</p>
<p>This drama takes modern marriage as its theme, dissecting the virtues and defects of modern marriage, including various aspects of free marriage, old-fashioned marriage, and other issues between men and women.</p>
<p>The distribution of roles in the play is also very interesting. Little actress Yuan Meiyun plays the wife of the fat man Guan Hongda, while the little bird Zhou Xuan plays their maid. There is a very interesting romance in this, that is, what Yuan Meiyun hates the most is her husband Guan Hongda's stupid brain, but Zhou Xuan likes him, so although the stupid Guan is ridiculed by his beautiful wife Yuan Meiyun on one side, he is favored by the delicate maid Zhou Xuan on the other side, so he is the luckiest person in "Wedding Night". In addition, Wang Yin plays a writer. He is dissatisfied with his romantic and modern wife (this role is still being sought) and finally runs away. Later, due to shared feelings, he and Yuan Meiyun announce that they are living together. Therefore, it can be said that "Wedding Night" is not only interesting in the plot, but also very interesting in the distribution of roles.</p>
<h3 id="e237">"Spicy Song" Premieres in Paris <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The Paris Grand Theater on Avenue Joffre will premiere the Soviet Union's blockbuster "Spicy Song", which was recently transported to China, starting today. The film caused a sensation in the Soviet Union when it was released and won an honorary award. At the same time, it will also screen the newsreel of the All-Union Games with sound dialogue. No detail of the entire event will be missed, which is more complete than the screenings of other companies.</p>
<h3 id="e238">The Inspector General's Fill-in <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Dan can be said to be a central figure in the Chinese drama world. This performance of The Inspector General originally had his important scenes, but he was unable to appear on stage after a major illness. It is really a loss on the stage this year. Now, he and Mr. Lai Tian are still acting as stage supervisors, which can be said to be inseparable from the stage even in life and death.</p>
<p>Five days before the performance, Gu Eryi, an important character in The Inspector General, also suddenly suffered from typhoid fever. Fortunately, Dr. Zhang Ziping carefully examined him and he was able to recover. This is really a great fortune among misfortunes.</p>
<p>Recently, it was also heard that Mr. Zhang Ni, one of the directors, has also been overworked in the past month. Fortunately, he did not collapse.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the cause of Zhao Dan's illness, the first effort to rehearse "Nora" was not without some cause. Artists often disregard life in order to pursue the truth and in-depth creation of art. Now, seeing Zhao, Gu, and Zhang's illnesses, it is even more believable.</p>
