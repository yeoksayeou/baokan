<h3 id="c9">國際弭戰運動 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>今日世局之艱危。無論在歐洲或在遠東。莫不如千鈞繫於一髮。各國政府當局正在殫智竭慮以應付危機。國聯對意制戴已定本月十八日開始實行。國際海軍會議亦定十二月五日在倫敦舉行。設此二者俱不免於失敗。則　武者勢必益復橫行無忌。而人類浩刧恐將一發不可收拾矣。</p>
<p>値此弭戰聲中。英外相雹爾復發表外交宣言。聲明英國人民决心恪守對歐洲與對全世界之旦旦信誓。並謂。『此種集體保安政策。不僅爲英國朝野之政治意識。亦且國聯全體之共同意志。不過英國資源豐富。勢力雄厚。在此後數年中應履行之義務與責任。特別艱重耳。』美總統羅斯福亦於歐戰停止紀念日宣布其世界政策。謂『美國完全同情於他國之弭戰運動。而始終反對野心者之侵略行爲。並謂今後全人類所遭遇之危險。必較美國人民單獨遭遇者。有過無不及。而神聖莊嚴之國際條約被人蔑視。尤爲最大之危機美國維護國際和平。唯有全力以赴之。』英美兩國均有力維世界和平之决心。於此可見。</p>
<p>英國之政策。吾人已多所論列。今將美國情形分析言之。美國內部意見。大別之可分三派。現行之中立法可謂代表主張絕對避免捲入戰爭漩渦者之意見。此於國會方面頗佔勢力。另一派以前外長史汀生爲代表。認定中立法包藏許多危險性。如歐戰時時。威爾遜總統嚴守中立者三年。卒於一九一七年爲時勢所迫。不得不參戰以維護國家之尊嚴。因而主張美國非積極參加集體行動。不足以求和平。且美國之責任應爲努力遏止戰爭不應躱避戰爭。亦惟有恊助世界防止戰爭之爆發。美國始得避免牽入。居於二派之間者。則爲羅斯福及赫爾總理等政府中人。主張中立法不應過於嚴格。而應於實行時以自由裁酌之權賦予總統。俾得運用之以襄贊世界和平。不致如今茲國聯對意制裁時有愛莫能助之感。赫爾近頃演說。曾微露於下屆國會修正中立法之意。是則美國政策。尙在多方顧慮。一時亦不至有若何堅確之决定也。然而今日世局。正如羅斯福總統所云。國際嫉妒依然存在。軍備膨脹有增無减。擾亂和平者之野心方與未艾。英美若不爲釜底抽薪之計。或不能放棄自私觀念。毅然决然爲全局安全之圖。則因循坐誤。及至最後覺悟。而世事變遷。已到不堪設想之地步矣。</p>

<p>— （十月十八二十一二十七二十八日對全國民衆講）中央研究院天文　研究所研究員</p>
<p>這是根據天文學上的分法，按月數來分別，以便於統計方面，譬如我們要春天的平均溫度就把三，四，五，三個月溫度的平均求出來就可以了，氣象學上常常用這個分法，至於三個分法裏頭那一個是好，那一個不好，那是沒有一定的標準，要看各地方的氣候如何而决定的，我們就理論上來說，我們中國的分法，就是第一個分法可以說是最合理的分法，他以天文學上溫暖時候叫做春分，為春季的中心，最熱的時候呌做夏至，為夏天的中心，是非常的妥當。</p>
<p>現在我們要講，地球上某一個地方的氣候，一年裏頭何以有種種的變化，我們已經知道地球的軌道是在黃道面裏頭，他和地球的赤道差不多成了二十力度半的角度，地球的自轉軸和他的赤道是互相垂直的，就是成九十度所以地球自轉軸和他的軌道垂直方向也成了二十三度半的角度，所以地球兩極對於太陽的狀態也隨時而不一樣。就是七月二十一日左右，地球北極向太陽斜了二十三度半，這時候南極在沒有日光的半球裏頭，而北極方面則一天裏頭，都受着太陽光，北半球事頭各地方，白天長，晚上短，南半球白日短，夜間長，冬至時候和這個相反，南極一天裏頭，都看的見太陽。春分和秋分時候，就是三月二十一日和九月二十三日左右，地球的赤道面通過太陽，所以地球上各地方蓋夜都是一樣的長短，赤道上的地方，一年裏頭畫夜的長，都是相等，所以可以說是無所謂四季的。</p>
<p>赤道南北二十三度半裏頭的地方，呌做熱帶，一年裏頭太陽都在頭上。自赤道南北二十三度半至六十六度半的地方，叫做溫帶，太陽沒有通過天頂的時候，而正午時太陽也沒有在地平綫下面的時候，所以四季的變化以溫帶為最甚，我們中國地方都在溫帶裏面，所以四季氣候的變化，也非常的利害。自溫帶至甫北兩極的地方，叫做寒帶，冬天不見太陽，夏天太陽也不落到地平綫下而在地平綫上繞行一周。</p>
<p>溫帶夏天為什麼比冬天熱？有人說因為夏天地球近於太陽所以熱，冬天地球離太陽遠所以冷這是錯誤的，我們就北半球來說冬天的時候，地球和太陽的距離是比夏天時候近，但是夏天地球旣然距離太陽遠，何以反而比冬天熱呢？我們知道四季氣候的變化就是蒙氣溫度的變化，蒙氣溫度的高低是隨着地球表面所受太陽的熱量而變化的，地球表面上單位面積，就是某一定地面，所受太陽熱量的多少，有三個主要原因：</p>
<p>（一）和太陽照在地面時間的長短有關係，就是太陽照地面的時間愈長，則地面所受的太陽熱量愈多。</p>
<p>（二）和太陽的直射或斜射有關係，就是太陽高度愈高則地面所受的熱量愈多，太陽高度愈低就是斜射，則地面所受的熱量愈少·</p>
<p>（三）和蒙氣的吸收有關係，就是日光通過地球蒙氣的道路愈厚，則蒙氣吸收太陽的熱量愈多，而地面上所受的熱量就愈少。</p>
<p>我們明白上面三個的關係，就可以知道夏天熱冬天冷的原故，我們巳經知道夏季時候白天長，中午時候太陽離頭上又近就是太陽的高度比冬天高，太陽光是正射在地面，他所穿過蒙氣的氣層薄，就是蒙氣所吸收太陽的熱量少所以天熱。冬季時候，白天短，中午時候太陽離頭上又遠，就是太陽的高度比夏天低，太陽光是斜射的，他所穿過蒙氣的氣層厚，就是蒙氣所吸收太陽的熱量多，所以天冷。</p>
<p>我們現在從春分那天說起，那時候畫夜一樣的長，過此以後白天漸漸比夜間長，太陽的高度也一天比一天高就是太陽由斜射漸漸變正射，並且太陽光穿過蒙氣，（蒙氣就是普通呌做空氣）的氣層也漸漸的薄，所以天氣是漸漸的熱起來，到了夏至，白天最長，太陽高度最高，太陽光穿過蒙氣層最薄，所以天氣最熱。從夏至以後，白天漸漸短，太陽高度漸漸低，到了秋分又是晝夜平分，所以天氣和春天一樣過了秋分，白天比晚上短，太陽高度漸低，所以通過蒙氣的氣層，又漸漸的厚，所以天氣是漸漸的冷起來。到了冬至，白天最短，太陽高度最低，太陽光穿過蒙氣層最厚，所以天氣最冷，過了冬至，白天又漸漸長，太陽高度也漸漸的高天氣就漸漸的和暖起來，這就是四季變化的情形。</p>
<p>我們上面已經說過在北半球地方所受的太陽熱量以夏至為最多，應以夏至為最熱，但實際上，夏至並不是最熱，而以八月左右為　熱。又冬至時候所受太陽熱量最少，應以冬至為最冷，但是實際小，冬至並不是最冷，而以二月左右為最冷，這種現象呌做四季的遲延，至於所以有這樣的現象，那時因為蒙氣的影響。</p>
<p>我們知道地球的周圍為蒙氣所包圍，因為蒙氣的作用，地球一方面受太陽的熱量，一方面又從地面向外面輻射出熱量，我們知道地球從太陽所受的熱量要比地面所輻射出去的熱量多則溫度才能够增高，若所受的熱量比輻射的熱量少則溫度减低。所以夏至時候地球所受的熱量是一年裏頭最多的時期，在這個時期裏頭，地表所受的熱量比地面所輻射的熱量多，所以溫度一天比一天的高，所以自夏至以後，至八月左右溫度是繼續的增高。達最高溫度的時候，這溫度停止增加，就是所受的熱量和所失的熱量相等的時候，這時期一年裏頭頂熱的時候，所以不在夏至而在乎八月左右。冬季時候和這個道理一樣，達最低溫度的時候要在一月來到二月的時候，但是氣候的變化不獨只看一個地方自已的狀况而决定的，還要看別地方所來的風，和海流等等的關係，所以某一個地方的最冷或最熱的時期，不是以天文學的理論所能决定的，他是年年都有相當的變化。（完）</p>

<p>— 鄔翰芳</p>
<p>菲律賓自治政府明天就成立了。我們對於這個亞洲嶄新的獨立國，不能不引起莫大的注意，為的是牠的經濟政治文化和我們都有很密切的關係的緣故。現在先把牠獨立運動的經過，原原本本的叙述一番：</p>
<p>（一）獨立運動的發端　菲人自從與美國武力抵抗停止以後，就開始作和平的獨立運動。不過以前對於這種運動，是沒有組織的。菲島第一個政黨聯盟黨，是主張把菲島永久合併於合衆國的，但是贊同的人很少。後來該黨又主張有相當時期準備的獨立。同時國民黨已經成立，他們是完全主張獨立的。一九〇七年，菲律賓第一次議會的選舉，國民黨的黨員佔多數，於是該黨組織一個代表團，對於獨立問題，作强有力的主張。</p>
<p>菲律賓為獨立問題，以菲議會內部的一致，和菲前總督塔虎脫（卽美前總統）的贊助，選出了兩個常駐的委員，派到華盛頓去。第二任的委員，現自治政府第一任大總統奎松氏也在其內。他是一九〇九年到一九一六年的委員，繼續向美國國會和美國的人民，表示獨立的願望。</p>
<p>（二）美國對菲律賓所取的政策美國對菲所取的政策，一般政治家的意見，都差不多。就是美政府先居在指導的地位，慢慢增加他們的自治權，最後還是由他們自主的，不過時間的問題罷了。</p>
<p>美總統麥金雷在一八九九年一月二十日，發了一道訓令給菲委員，表明他的願望，說是菲島將受最優惠的待遇，非征服的國家可比，因為菲律賓不是用武力直接向菲人奪取來的。我們要謀他們文化教育的進步，和自治能力的養成，這個責任，是不能放棄的。</p>
<p>塔虎脫總統，在菲島做總督的時候，一九〇三年十二月十七日，他會說道：「美國報紙，流行於菲島的，自始至終，都主張菲人行政權的擴大，這就是菲律賓是為菲律賓人的」的意思。美國在菲施行種種政治，也無非要保特『菲律賓是為菲律賓人的」這句話。為他的利益，進化，文明，…或者是獨立。現在惟一的問題，就是要用怎樣法子，纔可以為菲人謀幸福？』又一九〇四年四月間，塔虎脫君做戰事部秘書的時候，他曾談及菲律賓道：『當菲人學會自治政體，慢慢增加他們經騐的時候，我們兢可討論獨立問題怎樣解决。或者是保留原狀，依然在他親愛的，不自私的，指導者的美國保護之下。』</p>
<p>一九〇八年，在菲島議會開過之後，美總督羅斯福寫了一封信給議會，說是我相信菲律賓人自决的時機將要到了。他們願意自主的好呢？還是在强有力的不自私的勢力保護之下，一方能維持國內的秩序，一方能防止外力的侵入好呢？</p>
<p>威爾遜總統，在一九一三年十月六日，發了一封信，由馬尼拉總督哈力生轉給菲律賓人說道：『我們做保謎者，並不是謀美國人的利益，是為菲律賓人謀利益的。我們所取的步驟，最後是要給他們獨立的。並且預備使他們怎樣可以獨立。』一九一三年十二月二日，他又給一封信於美國議會，說道：『由他們自己的計劃和經騐，自然比較我們的好。我們要研究怎樣為他們服務，並且要想怎樣快快卸去監護人的責任。』</p>
<p>（三）鍾氏律鍾氏律的通過，眞是一件很可注意的事。他種種計劃，都是為菲律賓準備獨立着想的。他把這種意見介紹到美國上下兩院去，均遭否决。但經最後的討論，鍾氏律就通過了。</p>
<p>鍾氏律就是一種議决書，宣吿美國人民對於菲律賓將來政治上的意見。他的大意，包括在下面的敘文裏。</p>
<p>「旣然美國和西班牙的戰爭，美國人的心理，並沒有征服和擴充土地的野心，，而且美國人民的目的，常想在菲律賓退出他們的統治權，承認菲島的獨立，使他們趕快建設一個自治的政府。因為希望這種目的快快的實現，所以把許多政權，都交還他們的手裏，讓他們自己練習去，他自然會知道責任之所在，可以早日完成政治上的獨立。」</p>
<p>鐘氏律好像美國人民給華人一種保證書。因為美國歷任大總統所陳述，不過一種行政上的意見，實際上不能束縛美國的。加以美政府的政策，關於菲島最後的目的，就是要使菲人管理菲島之權更為擴大。鍾氏律所貢獻於菲人的，在態度上較為鮮明，在組織上較為具體的了。</p>
<p>美國省議會，地方公共各種團體，都很贊同鍾氏律，紛紛通過鍾氏律的議案，誠心願做鍾氏律的保證。</p>
<p>鍾氏律在菲人看來，好像美菲人民間一種契約。就自第一將來要建設自治政府，或者大權都在菲人手裏。第二美國主權，一時不可减少。第三自治政府建設成功的時侯，預備完全給他們獨立</p>
<p>（四）大戰中獨立運動之暫停一鍾氏律通過沒有好久，美國就參與歐洲大戰了。菲人以為不應在此時煩擾美國，獨立運動的論調，就暫時宣吿終止。</p>
<p>菲人應美政府之命，抽出三萬五千人，服役於歐戰，又供給美國幾艘潛行艇和滅魚雷艇。還有六千聲顧軍，投效在美國的海軍裏，這可以說美人在有事的時侯，菲人略效其勞。但美國人之助菲島，卽就財政一項而論，着實可說不少。美國人每年出五十萬元做菲島紅十字會的經費。菲人每次募集公債，美人均踴躍輸將，其總數已有七千萬金元。菲人在短時期中，百政具舉，自然靠美國的幫助了。</p>
<p>（五）戰後獨立說的復活歐戰停止後，獨立問題，又開始討論了。一九一八年十一月七號，參議院通過一個議案，為獨立的事體，增加一個委員。獨立委員會，計劃一切，要達到完全與美國分離為止。該會有什麼提議和報吿到參議院裏去，該院盡量採納。該委員會又派員到美國去，用感激尊敬的誠意，向美國作懇切的要求，以為菲人已經做他們應做的事，作同情的傾聽，但實際上沒有什麼動作。</p>
<p>一九一九年三月十七日，菲議院通過「目的的宣言。」這個宣言，正式的叙述菲人的地位，决心，和獨立問題的重要。大意說的是，對於獨立問題，我們要下决心去討論的時期到了。又反覆申明美人擴張他們自治的權限，和種種寬大的政策。菲人始終信仰，絲毫沒有變更。又論及鍾氏律是可靠的契約。菲自治政府的現狀，很可使美國及其餘各國滿意。美人從前盼望菲人要做的事，菲人均已履行，現在菲人只待美人履行他們的契約就是了。</p>
<p>美國政府代表之在菲島的，他有監視菲人在鍾氏律下建設政府的責任。總督哈力生會同菲參議院做一種報吿，給美國議會裏說：「我要陳說我總督的責任，我的意見，菲自主的政治，目前是很需要的。從前克蘭德總統和麥金雷總統也是如此主張的。幷且我們知道路得君受人民的帮助，當選為執政者，對內可以維持秩序，對外可以負國際上的責任的。」</p>

<p>—米麵價格亦提高—天津冊信、改鈔代現之部令頒抵津市後、此間銀行錢業、卽　於翌日開會、義決封存銀行公庫存銀七百八十萬元、由十一月四日起、停止兌現、其與津銀行錢業有關之津東各商店、則由各川換家戶、直接通知、嗣後匯兌賬目、凡有現大洋·大洋·現銀元·銀元·字樣者、一律改為國幣二字、收入兌出、皆遵中央規定之法幣為有效、詎銀錢業之議决、與財部頒行之命令、竟為一般漢奸市儈利用為造謠之機會、由五日起、市內百物價格、突然上騰、而找零使用之銅幣、則價格暴漲、由每元兌五百三十枚、跌至五百枚·四百八十枚、最高峯時、曾到三百七十枚、行市一日數變、物價亦隨之增高、社會謠諑繁興、貧民生計、乃大受影饗、比商經營之電車公司、為市內銅元總匯處、每日晨間懸牌兌換、各兌換業、亦恃為取扱之所、乃因漲價故、認為有利可圖、居奇壟斷、擅作行市、每日兌出數目亦减少、九十兩日、並在各路電車內揭示通吿、請乘客以鋼元購票、勿以角票購票、該公司不負銅元市行一切責任等語、於是乘客與車掌間、糾紛時起、市公安局於十一月六日、曾一度佈吿、禁止操縱壟斷、並不准抬高米麵市價、結果未能生效、十一月九日、再召集錢糧業開會、着令切實平抑價格、米麵須恢復五日前之市行、銅元規定每法幣一元兌五百枚、電車公司兌出市行、須每元五百零三枚、準兌換業兌出後、取利三枚、同時再頒嚴厲佈吿、但十日一日中、因官方所定法價過高、商店收入者相差之數過多、均拒絕兌換、卽零星購物、欲找回銅元時、各商店寗肯收回交易、亦不照行兌用、是日復因電車公司例假、銅元未外兌出、市上現貨缺乏、致感周轉困難、迄晚、市政府准八區建設處聯銜呈請、特出示嚴厲佈吿、不許居奇操縱、否則執法以繩、公安局晚間捕獲囤積銅元之奸商二起、行市始稍平穩、迄十一日、米麵業遵照官應命令、切實抑價、銅元外運者减少、市况方見平穩、至於銅元漲價原因、多緣謠諑過熾、四鄉農民不明法幣眞象、購買銅元囤積、致市內異常缺乏、演成暴漲現象、</p>

<p>— 紀元</p>
<p>重慶之形形色色（下）</p>
<p>四、軍人別墅星羅棋佈四川過去多數軍人之橫征暴歛情形、幾成為全國盡人皆知之事實、記者某日偶與渝地人士閒談、知重慶市通遠門外有所謂「軍人公館區域、」軍人而有公館、原屬常事、但公館而有區域、且所謂公館、有花園·有洋房·有亭臺·有球塲·甚至更有動物園者、實為重慶所特有、記者興之所至、特趨車通遠門外、一覩軍人公館區域之情形、</p>
<p>車出通遠門、舉首遠望、參差不一之東方式的洋樓建築、淸晰可見、房屋構造精緻而幽雅、依山帶水、四週林木環繞、宛如世外桃源、記者因友人之介、曾進某師長公館參觀、見館內一切華麗之設備、如高爾夫球塲·雨天網球塲·精緻花園·汽車等等、無不應有盡有、前亭後閣、佈置玲瓏、鳥語花香、沁人心腑、嗣與該公館內茶役攀談、據言、「主人現有太太七位、尙有一二位已脫離關係、這一區域中、太太最多的要算某師長、有十多位、錢亦最多、主人因生平急公好義、故不但沒有積蓄、反而負債纍纍、」幷謂「這一帶內公館不下百座、旅長以上的軍人佔多數、從前做過大官、現在閒居享福的也不少數、」記者聽罷、不禁愕然、</p>
<p>遊畢某師長公館、卽往茝園遊覽、該園聞亦係某軍人公館、今則租諸某商人營業、布置頗似上海半淞園、但其中有旅館飯店、林木茂密、環境淸幽、為富紳豪賈下榻之所、軍政要人、在此宴會者頗多、</p>
<p>五、生活特點飲茶養鳥重慶市民、除一般苦力勞動者外、大率為有閒階層的人民、他們安於傳統的生活習慣、多以茶樓為消磨時間的唯一方法、重慶的小茶室特別多、價錢亦特別便宜、化銅元一枚、卽可在茶館坐上三四小時、或則交頭接耳、議論是非、或則高聲喧譁、報吿新聞、或則下棋消遣、或則調解他人糾紛、聞重慶許多茶室內、有類似哥老會組織的分子、徘徊其間、川人叫哥老會曰「跑哥」叫老頭子曰「大爺、」輩份最大、次則「大哥」「二哥」等、會中紀律頗嚴、對大爺有絕對服從的義務、大爺對其所屬、有生殺予奪之權、哥老會等級分「仁·義·禮·智·」四種、仁為最高、義次之、禮又次之、智為下層組織、在太平天國時曾極盛一時、迄今殘餘勢力猶存、鄕間人加入者頗多、外省人士如到川省遊覽、倘能與哥老會中有相當聲望分子來往、或請其保護、則所到之處、可以安全無恙、否則容易發生不幸事故、近聞省府當局、有限制設立茶館之議、</p>
<p>養鳥也是重慶有閒人生活習慣之一、他們淸晨起來、無事可做、於是手提鳥籠一隻、漫步街上、或則徘徊公園和樹林間、側身長坐、細聽鳥鳴嚶嚶、記者晨起至中央公園遊覽、未進園門、卽聞鳥聲與人聲相和、一種怡然自得之狀、雖盛世之民、亦不是過也、</p>
<p>六、知識勞動者市塲重慶一般苦力須經過中間人之手、始能出賣其勞力、或者得到其勞動工具、其情形已如前述、除此以外、知識勞動者亦有其尋求工作之塲所、據友人江君談、重慶中央公園前面、有一茶館曰「餘樂、」為中小學校聘請教師時互相接洽的地方、校長如欲聘請某學科教師、而未得其人、可至「餘樂」茶圍閒坐、或倩人向「餘樂」茶園接洽、失業教師如欲覓相當職業、亦可往「餘樂」打聽消息、此種機關、頗似職業介紹所、而又無公開負責的人、聞重慶中小學教師、近來失業者頗多、重慶開明書店經理王君會語記者、「重慶及附近各縣教育情形、均甚困難、各級學校欠薪有達一年以上者、巴縣一縣、原有小學六十餘所、本年則减至二十所、中學以前在東里有東里中學、南里有南里中學、現則完全取消、巴縣教育經費來源為「紅莊、」（賣買田地時所抽之稅、）肉稅附加·以及水菓捐，白炭捐等、收入不多、現僅巴縣一縣、失業教師有二百餘人云、</p>
<p>七、重慶巿政建設計畫十月五日晨、記者趨車市府、拜訪張市長必果、由周秘書惠黎代見、承吿重慶市政建設計劃甚詳、謂市府目前中心計劃、為（一）統制商業、（二）指導投資、（三）改良生產技術、使每年收入繼續增加、（民二十一年以前、重慶猪鬃輸出收入年達三百萬元、現僅有九十萬元、）（四）四部成立農業指導所、調劑供需、管理工廠、以改善工人生活、（七）設立市銀行、吸收小資本、救濟小商人（八）成立職業介紹所、小本借貸處、及公營當舖、（九）於朝天門·通遠門·太平門等地、成立平民飯店、建築平民寄舍、（十）成立救濟院、救濟殘廢老弱幼嬰孤兒、（現重慶救濟院僅能容納百五十人）以上計劃、在重慶市政上、均屬必要之舉、甚望能漸次見諸實施耳、</p>

<p>三個月後卽可實行</p>
<p>六七年來、久商未决之中法通航問題、茲經探悉、已於日前由中華民國國民政府交通部·與法國航空部·正式簽訂中法通航合約、其經過情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>商訂經過</p>
<p>中法通航、其動機始於中華民國十八年間、其時法國正計畫瓶辦自馬賽至越南西貢之航空綫、卽以東方航空公司名義、向中國交通當局籌商中法通航、以利兩國間之空運交通、當時因有若干技術問題、尙待確商、一時未得解决、嗣後法國遠東航綫芷式開航、中國與法國及歐洲間之航空交通、亦日感需要、中間又迭經商洽、直至最近法國航空部部長、派定代表、切實商討、雙方以合作精神、開誠相見、遂商定草案、各經主管長官認可後、已於日前由雙方各派代表、在南京簽訂中法通航合約、</p>
<p>合約要點</p>
<p>（甲）自廣州經廣州灣至法屬河內間、設置定期航綫、由完全隸屬中華民國國民政府交通部之航空公司經營、往返載運客貨郵件、幷在法屬河內、與法國航空公司之航綫相啣接、（乙）合約簽訂後、三個月內、該航綫應卽開航、合約之有效期間為三年、</p>
<p>籌備情形</p>
<p>前項合約、經簽訂後、交通部卽委託中國航空公司、派機試航廣州、經廣州灣至河內之航綫、同時準備若干駕駛員、以資服務、預計三個月內、中法通航、將可實現、從此中法兩國空運交通、得以聯絡、增益兩國邦交、亦匪淺鮮也、</p>

<p>——謹獻於中國國民黨第五次全國代表大會諸同志和好談政制改革的先生們——</p>
<p>第三·國難的能否解除，全視吾國家上下的能否一心一德，努力盡職以為斷，而與黨治的取消與否，訓政的結束與否，可說是絲亳無關。目前國際環境，已經不許我們冉是因循玩忽地過日子，如果由領袖以至羣衆，大家眞能埋頭苦幹，不信國難會永久嚴重，更不信民族終於不能復興。反之，如果取消了黨治，讓許多的政黨來攘奪競爭，結束了訓政，讓賄選出來的議員在議會裏來儘景搗亂，大掣政府的肘，試問國難會不會更加嚴重？民挨會不會就此復興？蔣廷黻是自稱與國民黨無好感的，但他在天津大公報上說得好：「政權在什麼人手裏，人民是不關心的；他們所希望的是握權者能替國家人民作幾件較大的事體」所以黨治的政府，訓政的政府，如果能替國家人民解除國難，其受人民的愛戴，必不讓於民治的政府，憲政的政府；反之，如果民治憲政的政府不能解除國難，人民也必定厭棄牠，而黨治訓政的政府或許有一天要重現。看到德意志國社黨可以推翻白魯寗政府，在韋瑪憲法之下組織起一黨專政的政府來，就可以知道。蔣廷黻又說：「反蔣者如想他們的事業一成功，外患就自然而然地會停止，這是作夢。或想就是不停止，他們一得政權，就能有抗日的力量，這是欺人」這眞是打開天窗說亮話了，目前那些反對國民黨的人切齒痛恨着，以爲只要打倒國民黨的黨治，結束國民黨的訓政，國難就自然而然地會解除，他不是作夢，就是欺人。（未完）</p>

<p>欲明近年來上海紗業之異動大勢，自需從其產銷情形，及其紗花市價之悄長卜之。據華商紗廠聯合會統計，近三年來各廠出紗包數略有增加，二十一年爲六十四萬餘包。二十二年爲六十五萬餘包，二十三年爲六十七萬餘包，本年爲首三季則尙無整個數字。至其銷路之增减，可就上海紗布交易所各客帮現紗成交數之消長，推見其一斑：</p>
<p>近三年來上海各客帮現紗成交數量表（原位包）</p>
<p>二十二年　二十三年　二十四年</p>
<p>一月　——　一七，六三六　一七，五六九</p>
<p>二月　——　一一，三九〇　一九，〇七一</p>
<p>三月　一三，八〇一　一三，六八〇　四六，一〇四</p>

<p>十二月　一一，三六九　三四，〇六八　——</p>
<p>各月平均　二六，六七四　二八，二〇六　二六，七四一</p>
<p>按年而言，本年客銷情形略較去年爲遜，然與前年相較，則仍稍有起色。按月而言，本年三月客銷特旺，比去年前年激增三萬餘包，故三月以後，遂趨於下游，九月又轉旺盛。綜合觀之，本年爲首三季各月之客銷，固較前年同期增多，卽與去年同期亦互有上下，故今後前途，或有可觀。</p>
<p>存紗堆積。固爲困難期問上海紗業之重要病象之一，惟近三年來總在繼續减少過程中，本年八月，上海存紗呈空前之低額，實爲轉危爲安之徵兆也。</p>
<p>過去，上海紗業陷於困難之境，原因多端，前已約略言之。此外棉貴紗賤實爲此業之致命傷。今以標花標紗之市價比較說明之：</p>
<p>查上海棉價二十三年平均較二十二年增長百分之三，而同期紗價反跌百分之七。本年棉價雖然大跌，但紗價亦隨之下落，若以民二十二年爲基年，紗價仍跌在棉價之下，此實上海紗業之一大問題。吾人一面需排除原棉之壟斷，同時改良運輸，减輕原棉運費，始有解救之道。</p>
<p>至目前機製棉紗之成本價格，若以十六支人鐘牌每包售價一六八元爲例，可分析如下：一·每包需棉花三百五十斤，現價每百斤三十二元，共一百一十元；二·固定資本及人工二十七元；三·工廠利潤八元四角二分（紗價若有漲跌，工廠利潤依之升降），四·利息十二元，五·統稅八元五角八分。但由上海運棉紗至內地，所需費用，亦頗不少，因遠近不同情形如下：一·上海至南昌，運費十二元，商店平時利潤五元，共十七元；二·由南昌至臨川，運費四元，利息三元，商店利潤三元，共十元，故在昌每包須售一八五元，臨川須售一九五元，否則，卽在成本以下出售。此種成本價格之計算，實爲關心工商業者所當注意者也。</p>
<p>上海紗業之沿革，地位及其產銷情形，均已論述如前，茲再就財部之新貨幣政策，一測其前途。據量近財部所頒佈之新貨幣法，其自的乃在停止紙幣兌現，以防白銀之外流，對外可統制匯兌，對內可提高物價。蓋自去秋以來，海外銀價激漲，國內物價受其影饗，相對下跌，紗價自非例外。今新貨幣政策如能循序而進，對於上海紗市或有一番好影響也。</p>

<p>「很有點利害；可是我不想叫你起來的。」</p>
<p>「我原像一個貓頭鷹，晚間常常在跑來跑去的。是的，你的脚眞像火一般：那些包布又得濺濕一番了，」說着那個貓頭母鷹，已拍着翅膀去再取些冷料和一大瓶的冰水。</p>
<p>「啊，眞好！」唐恩發了一聲長嘆，當浸濕的布又復包在他的脚上，並且竭飲了一次水又給他乾枯的喉嚨以一種爽快的感覺。</p>
<p>「現在，好好睏罷，假如你再看見了我，也用不到着慌，因為一下我又要溜進來一看，再給你一次冷　的。」</p>
<p>到了天將曉時，她重行濟入他的房間裏，見他睡得很熟，她為他換紗布時也若無所知，只不過臉上痛苦的痕跡忽漸自平復，等她走開的時候，他臉上已現出極寗靜的狀態了。</p>
<p>第二大是星期日，屋子裏很靜，因此他直到響午方始醒了過來，四週一看，見了一個具有急切臉色的小臉兒在鬥口向裏窺視。他仲出兩臂，坦第直跑過那個勇間，全身倒在床上，喊道，「我的唐納來老！」緊緊拘着，並且喜樂之極，至於全身動着如小虫一般。裴夫人接着也來了，捧了早餐，坦第一定要自已給他吃一倒食，因此喂他得像喂一個小孩，可是因為唐恩並不很餓，所以倒也很喜歡的。</p>

<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>腸結核（又名腸癆）。乃腸粘膜發生結核之結節。多山肺癆繼起者也。發生原因。爲患者對於咯痰。不能吐出。咕咕嚥入胃腑所致。因肺癆患者之痰液中。含有無數猛烈之結核菌。嚥下胃腑。卽結構病巢。遇機繁殖。但胃中有含酸性之胃液。本有防腐作用。能阻止結核菌之發育。故於肺癆初期之間。胃尙健全時。雖有無數量結核菌侵入。尙無大礙。然徐徐進行。過第一期進而至第二期。更進而至第三期。則身體日漸衰弱。抵抗力减退。胃液之分泌。自然减少。阻止結核菌之酸性液。異常缺乏。於是。在胃中之結核菌。卽活躍繁殖。且由胃入腸。腸者。爲結核菌最易繁殖之所。故陽結核之病症由是以起。</p>
<p>腸結核之症象。初時。每日有一二次之軟糞。在大解前覺腹部作痛。腹部有滾動感覺。疲弱無力。食物不易消化。右下腹部。時常感覺不快。稍久則症狀愈劇。下痢次數亦多。此爲腸結核之普通症狀。此等症狀。持續頗久。不易卽治。下痢狀態。亦不劇烈。時時有些微下痢。此乃腸結核之特徵。故結核患者之慢性不痢。須注意及之。</p>
<p>腸結核之預防。調查患肺癆者。於進至二期或三期之時。多半罹腸結核。其原因實爲嚥下咯痰之故。故預防方法。患肺癆者雖在初期。必嚴禁嚥下咯痰。時常用藥水3％KaliChlorat漱口內服『肺活』thithWeal有防腐殺菌之作用。兼能制止陽胃之異常酸酵。振興食慾。而促進食物滋養分之吸收。而病者之營養。因之改良。卽此數點。可以斷有特效。</p>
<p>腸結核之治療。須對於其主要原因之肺病。應盡全力將其治愈。在初起時卽服用『肺活』。輕病多能痊治。若已至重症之時。除按時服用『肺活』PhithWesl外。宜請醫施行注射與各種理學等療法。同時幷實行空氣營養安郝諸天然療法。</p>
<h3 id="c158">瘰癧與腺病之新療法 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 姜冠羣</p>
<p>懍癧與肺病有密切之關係。一般人量皆知之·瘰癧者·爲頸腺之結核。不問大人與小兒。世界最多之病症也。以瘰癧之原因。成肺結核而死者·决不乏人。蓋腺之結核。最易犯肺也</p>
<p>又近來有謂小兒之腺病體質者。卽體質枯瘦。面色蒼黃。莫名其故。虛弱不堪。一望而知爲病弱小兒也。雖常人見此。動輒曰「此兒豈非腺病質乎』。爲之起疑念也。</p>
<p>腺病者。依舊腺爲結核所犯。因之營業衰弱。虛弱之狀。一見卽知。患如是腺病之小兒。發生潔癧。或變爲肺結核。故腺病質小兒之父母。常爲之憂慮。就醫生請問攝生方法。以圖恢復。但此依然於初期之時。不加以相當治療。遂有後悔莫及之一日焉。是故瘰癧與腺病之治療法。雖有種種。其中有最確切最有效之全治法。低在初期時代。（卽腺結核時代）若腺結核更進一步—而爲肺結核時代。則稍形困難。倘僅在瘰癧腺病時代。多半能恢復。其法。卽爲『盡力於營養療法』。對於瘰癧腺病所用之滋養强壯劑。醫家咸以「康氏生活素」Conbour'sSan-Vita-Cell效力最大。按編者經騐。若連服三月不怠者。則身體强壯。症狀消除。蓋病症重輕。所需時間雖各不同。但多半皆需長久之時間。故患者須不厭不倦。持之以恒。未有不痊也。然則此種療法。在今日之學理上。爲瘰癧與腺病最確切之治療劑。無庸疑矣。</p>
<h3 id="c159">肺活量與健康 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 沈香伯醫師</p>
<p>吾人由空氣中所吸入之養氣。祇有一部分在肺中與其他氣體行交換作用。他部分則仍遺留於肺中。此種遺留之空氣名爲殘氣。大約有一千二百立方糎。又普通一呼吸間所吸入之空氣量約有五百立方糎。然呼出肺內空氣之後。若再努力。尙能呼出多量。此等普通吸氣之後。再行深吸。然後所能盡呼出之空氣量。名曰肺活量。此量因人種。個人。及年齡等不同。英國人平均爲三千七百立方糎。穗國人平均爲三千二百立方糎。東洋人種平均在學生爲三千三百立方糎。在勞動者則爲三千九百三十立方糎。大抵身體强壯。身材愈高者肺活量愈大。東洋人種平常少壯之男子肺活量有三千二三百立方糎。即可稱爲强壯之軀體。婦女大約有男子之四分之三卽二千四百立方厘左右。便可目爲健康者矣。</p>
<p>编者按　凡屬感染結核者。卽因體虛肺弱——吸收養氣排除炭酸氣之作用不足。故極易患肺部之疾病。欲事預防。須練習深呼吸。使換氣佳良。幷內服補身强肺等藥劑。更爲重要。余臨診體虛肺弱之人。一律囑用『肺活』PhithWeal。因本品內含壯補療肺等重要藥劑。虛弱者服之。可强身防癆。已病者服之。得早日治愈。余見凡經服過『肺活』者。莫不體力强壯——肺活量高大。即經醫師宣吿癆病者。亦於短期內恢復康健。余因實騐之成績如此美滿。故記之以告同胞也</p>

<p>現今肺結核之療法。堪爲世界注目最有價値者。厥惟『臟器療法』。此種製劑中得醫家公認有効者。亦僅以穗國鐵比藥廠出品之『肺活』PhithWeal効力超羣。歷經中西諸彥詳述殆盡。自己無待曉曉。惟余因該劑之於肺結核患者。特有豐功偉績。爰記其臨床經過。俾世之人知所問津焉。</p>
<p>第一例　楊君。三十七歲。業商。</p>
<p>主訴　咳嗽氣喘，潮熱盜汗，痰中夾血</p>
<p>食慾不振，身體削瘦等。</p>
<p>診斷　左側肺結核（第二期）</p>
<p>治療經過　囑嚴守安靜。爲注射Glucalcin,Helpin等針。約二星期。症象微見輕快。患者因欲回至安慶故鄉修養。停止注射。令余開方購藥帶回內服。即囑向中西藥房購『肺活』PhithWeal一打。照法服用。於兩星期前接其來函。據云服完兩瓶後。則噴嗽氣喘悄失。潮熱低降。血痰自服藥後未見。食量稍增。余去信令繼續服用。後於本月四日又接來信並附下X光照片一張。檢視病寵。早爲進行型之左下葉滲出性結核。現已變爲停止型結締增殖形成疤痕。確向治愈之途矣。據信中所述。一切病象均除。且精神飽滿。血色紅潤。彼問是否痊愈。欲否續服。余囑再用半打。以求根治。又令加服『康氏生活素』Conbour'sSan-Vita-Cell增進其營養。使軀體迅速康健。始無復發之憂。前日楊君突來道謝。據稱如此痼疾。爲時僅有三月。竟得痊愈來店復職。何啻再造。感謝不已。</p>
<p>第二例　顧君。二十四歲。學生。</p>
<p>主訴　早患遺精病三年。於今春服用『還爾童』始治愈。惟身體尙未完全回復康健。於五月間罹患重傷風。病後更形衰弱。繼又咳嗽發作。早夕尤甚。曾服市上各種療肺藥水等均無效。近來病勢突見增惡。如潮熱，盜汗，咯血，食慾減退等病象。不一而足。身體削瘦。稍一運動卽發氣喘。</p>
<p>診斷　右側肺結核（第二期）</p>
<p>治療經過　本年九月廿八日來診。嚴令絕守安靜。配與解熱健胃消痰止咳等劑。十餘日無效可見。則勸行注射療法。病者拒絕。令改內服。余卽囑用『肺活』PhithWeal服至十二日。咳嗽漸平。熱度低降爲三十七度二。又服二星期。食量大增。各症消失。再續服一月。卽達全治。惟身體瘦弱仍未大健。令加服滋養强壯劑『康氏生活素』Conbour'sSan-Vita-Cell服然一打。則體重突增。精神振作。身體肥胖顯完較多。顧君幸賴『肺活』得治愈其危篤肺癆。又藉『康氏生活素』恢復其營養。故稱謝不已。</p>
<h3 id="c161">衰弱患者的強壯劑 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 陳一靑醫師</p>
<p>衰弱者的服用補劑——以及打補血針之類。原是一般病人最所希望。然而試觀市上各種製劑。種類實在極多。究竟對於衰弱病人。是否有效適宜。這却是個問題。譬如魚肝油與維他命A丸兩種。大家都知道他是滋養補劑。原也不錯。可是遇到久病的肺結核患者——與胃陽力非常薄弱的人。則此等油類與膠球。非但難以消化。無益人體。幷且反而促進下痢。連食慾和消化力吸收力等。都要受其不良的影響。考其結果。是欲强壯—而益致衰弱。豈不是弄巧成拙麼！</p>
<p>總之。凡有衰弱病人。如果要用滋養强壯的藥劑。第一·滋養强壯劑本身。務須不害消化器官。第二·倘能直接吸收。自然更好。據此以觀。則『康氏生活素』Conbour'sSan-Vita-Cell是各國醫家公認最爲合宜的！</p>
<p>因爲『康氏生活素』的成分。是動物性蛋白質的人工消化產生物。即所謂對於人體最有關係的各種重要『阿密諾酸』AminoAcid而且配有其他種種强壯補血劑。換言之。卽無需胃陽的消化。而能達滋養强壯的目的。此其所以對於肺病衰弱的人。格外妥當無比！</p>
<p>余自應用「康氏生活素」以來。於今已實騐四十餘人。就中祇有六人因重篤肺病不治外。餘皆轉弱爲强。其中尤以肺癆及神經衰弱患者爲多。余以此種補劑。價値低廉。効力偉大。故樂爲發表推獎也</p>

<p>（一）手淫之爲害</p>
<p>手淫爲風行之惡習慣。貝爾克爾氏謂「靑年男子百人則百人皆有手淫。靑年女子則百人中九十九人已確定其有此事實。而其餘一人。則恐爲不肯宣佈其真實也」云。此種習慣。乃近世文明之產物。文化愈進步。生活之程度亦愈增高。於是結婚益復困難。即接近娼妓及其他婦人。亦因經濟之困而不能。遂致惡弊愈見繁多矣。物質文明日益進步。則神經性疾患。如歇斯的里Hysteria神經衰弱Neurasthenie等亦日益增加。故多數學者謂神經衰弱與手淫。頗有因果關係之存在云。</p>
<p>手淫之爲害。則以體質之强弱。年齡之多寡。及方法度數之如何，而有不同。凡年幼體弱。旦旦伐之者。終不免於神衰力弱。疾病叢生之虞。至當春情發動之際。危害尤大。非特傷神經。耗體力。且能阻止生殖器之發育。陷於種極之畸形及機能之障碍。而使生殖作用。完全斷絕。人生幸福。盡付東流。前途有爲之靑年。一變而爲可憐無用之殘身矣。茲更言其所致之疾病如後文。（未完）</p>
<p>編者註如因手淫過度——以致神經衰弱。生殖器障碍——如夢遺·滑精·早漏·陰萎·腦力不足——頭痛暈眩失眠健忘等症者。除嚴守規則的生活外。可服用內分泌製劑「還爾童」WeliTonic及補腦强壯劑「康氏生活素」Conbour'sSan-Vita-Cell則能迅速恢復康健。余實騐多人。確有特效。爰爲寫。以吿同病也。</p>
<h3 id="c163">百日咳之危險 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 陳一靑</p>
<p>百日咳Keuchhrsten爲專犯小兒之一種傳染病。由一種微生物。侵入小兒之呼吸器而生。七歲以內之小兒。患之者最多。即新生兒亦有患是症者。多由空氣，玩具，衣服用器等之媒介而傳染。一家中潑現一病人後。其兄弟姊妹。必相繼傳染。本病之症狀—經二至七日潛伏期後。呈單純支氣管點膜炎症狀。咳嗽約一至二週。一次起發作性痙　性咳嗽。約四五週。發作輕者。一日三回至三十回。重者六十回至百回。最終發作漸次减少。二三週可以治愈。其經過通常二月以上。亦有遷延至六七月者。</p>
<p>小兒患本症時。常併發種種疾病。最多者爲支氣管肺炎。小兒患百日咳致死者。大都爲併發支氣管肺炎之故。要之百日咳一症。幷不發熱。如有發熱三十八度以上。接連兩三日不見减退時。則必有併發症。除支氣管肺炎外。更須注意。腦膜炎，中耳炎，肺臌脹等。亦往往與百日咳併發。</p>
<p>小兒患百日咳時。有時要發現脫腸—有臍部脫腸，鼠蹊部脫腸，但與生命無危險。不足懼慮。本症治愈後。往往繼發肺結核病。凡榮養不良及有腺病之小兒。患本症後。殆皆繼發肺癆。故於百日咳恢復期內。務要特別注意。百日咳之預防。首須隔離。以防感染。患病小兒不得與其他小兒接觸。最爲重要。</p>
<p>百日咳之療法。本症發現以後。切須留意勿再受感冒。食物擇易消化之流動物而富有滋養分者。居室須消潔明亮而通風。精神務宜安靜。凡喜怒驚懼等精神感動。與高聲電光等五官刺戟。均須避免爲要。本症之治療。現今尙無特效藥。雖有一種百日咳菌苗注射療法。但奏效尙未臻完美。普通醫生治療。祗採取對症療法。若咳喇發作時。與以抑制鎭靜咳嗽劑而已。</p>
<p>近有「肺活」，PhithWeal藥。用於百日咳。能淸肺止咳。化痰爲水。消炎滅菌。預防支氣管肺炎。縮短經過期間。故醫家咸賞用之。著者亦經實騐多回。確有奇效。且本品內無毒質。昧甚甘美。與病兒內服尤爲便利。</p>
<p>百日咳一症。自常人觀之。無足輕重。實則死亡之數。數倍於麻疹等傳染病。有合併症者更危險。幼稚之小兒。危險尤甚。故發病之初。卽服「肺活」PhithWeal更須盡力攝生。即無支氣管肺炎之虞。</p>

<h3 id="c164">論出版界的投機 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 須旅</p>
<p>有人在慨嘆出版界的投機，商業化。出版是一商業之一種，在商戰的現代，商業必須投機而後有出路，有錢賺，不蝕本。仔細想來，這是極正常的現象：所謂「化」，是並不是的，只是一種「本色」。投機是商業的技巧之一，本色的技巧之一。出版界要是不投機，除非不是商業。要是是商業而不投機，那麼出版家只能喝西風去。</p>
<p>我不是一個出版家；也不是在替投機的商業出版界辯護。我的意思是：在商戰的現代，投機和商業都是正常的名目，率直一點說：是正常的行爲。以這樣的名目向出版界苛責，是笨而不當的，等于責備一個專靠賭錢吃飯的人，說：『你爲什麼要賭錢！』</p>
<p>出版界的投機，局外人看來，實在是可惡，有傷文化事業的尊容，但在他們自己，却把這看得極平常，極正當。他們以爲，建築在商業形式上的出版界的任事，也只能是這樣。爲什麼？因爲現代的商業正是這個情形：非投機就不能站住脚。</p>
<p>現在的出版界終于只是一種買賣，而買賣則終于是需要手段的。</p>
<p>所以，單是咒駡出版界的投機，在原則上固然甚是，但于情勢是不大適合的。駡投機的出版家喪盡了良心，在原則上固然無疵可議，却是沒有體諒到被駡奢的苦衷的。要指摘出版界的墮落，應該指出其所以墮落的根源。</p>
<p>目今的出版界之墮落，是顯見的，無可諱言的。那麼怎樣會墮落的呢。出版界並不是「愛』墮落，是另外有個原由迫得他們如此墮落的。這，狹義地說：便是投機，也不是『愛』投機，而是在某種情勢下不得不投機的。</p>
<p>這某種情勢，這原由，依我看起來，還要歸到一個大題目：社會經濟不景氣。</p>
<p>這題目太大，區區不敢談。這是的意思，只是以替出版界喊寃爲止。</p>
<p>經濟狀况好，出版界自然而能會向上，會不投機的。這是很淺顯的事：我們只要看幾家資本足的書店之出書比較嚴肅鄭重，而小書店之出書則胡亂馬虎，便可明白。</p>
<p>在這樣無可奈何的情勢下，直面的向出版界申斥：『呔！你投機豈有此理！』或者喝斷：『噲！不許投機！』……這些，都不成功。我們只能：一方面企求根源所在的社會經濟轉好，一方面企求出版家于可能範圍內存點良心。只能企求，不能責成——因爲無法責成。</p>
<p>但良心是要有餘裕時才能有的。現在的出版界處于窘極的狀態下，恐怕難得肯發現良心。——此所以我們的出版界之沒有辦法！</p>
<p>投機者，是迎趕潮流的意思。是好的潮流，則這投機將是一種好現象，因爲因了大家的投機，會促使潮流更活潑，更廣大，也就是使出版界更蓬勃，更豐富，更有生氣。但潮流是壞的呢，投機可就會生出壤的效果來了。因爲投機的多，壞潮流也就更泛濫得厲害，成爲洪水，無可收拾。</p>
<p>所以投機倒也並不通是壞。好壤也還要以潮流爲依歸。潮流是讀者的趣味方向所激成。那麼，從讀者的趣味方面着手去診治投機的不良形勢，或許倒也是一個治本的方法。</p>
<p>這該是敎育家，批評家，著作家的任務了吧。雖然讀者的趣味方向與投機也有關聯；但比之于以上那些「家」，出版家的責任是要比較得少一點的。</p>
<p>目今的出版界的投機情勢，我覺得不負責任的敎育家，批評家，著作家們，不但不負責任而已，也有着促成的力量呢。</p>
<p>最後，從原則上談一談投機的害處。投機的害處，除直截的助長惡潮流外，更有細密之點在。</p>
<p>舉一個例，譬如出一本書。書的內容是迎合潮流的。所迎合的潮流是不良的潮流，那麼不消說別的，那本書已經是不良的了。所迎合的潮流是好的呢，照例應該是本好書了，然而不，還是一本壞書。</p>
<p>潮流之過也是快速的。尤其是我們中國的各個「界」。譬如文學中的潮流吧，在西洋往往要流上許多年，然而在中國，只消幾個月。因此，一本書要趕上潮流，甚至是潮流的最高點（潮流最高點最賣得出），便非也同樣地快速製出不可。做書者必須緊趕造，出版者也必須上緊趕印，于是只顧到快而不顧到精——不，連像樣也不顧，結果那本書雖是好題村，也是一塌糊塗。潮流總算是趕上了頭，熱心于潮流的讀者是拉着黃牛就是馬，不細察內容的好壞的，只是讀，只是讀，也許讀了之後還以爲是一本好書——因爲他認爲它是『時代的產物』。出版家呢，自然總算賺了一點錢了，把注意力全注在錢上時，當然再無出現『良心』的餘裕，全乎不管那本書于不幸的讀者發生了什麼影響。</p>
<p>投機于壞潮流是當然壞；但投機于好潮流往往也不能免于過：便是這種粗製濫造。</p>
<p>診治之方法與上面相同：要治本。但一方面也有待于三『家』的盡其任務：敎育家吿訴讀者「什麼樣的書是壞書」，枇評家指出「那一本是壞書』，著作家則做一本好的出來，同瓖的比一比，使人一目了然于它的壞。</p>
<h3 id="c165">評王文濡編校「龔定盦全集」 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 宏叔</p>
<p>世界書局印行的國學六大名著中有龔定盫全集，風行一時。但這部書實即一九〇九年國學扶輪社本，只有一部分補注在外。前本題皞皞子編校，此本題王文濡編校，今兩書序文，言多暗合，疑即一人。我們對於這本子有三點要說。</p>
<p>第一，此書首列王序有云：「清至嘉道……定菴乃崛起其間…沿及同光，尊爲龔學…遺集流傳，經若干名家之評跋…予所見約有數十家，皆能道其心得，彙而錄之，積久亡其姓字」。這是說今書評跋，是他彙錄的。其實不然。國學扶輪社本吳煦序後有題「乙未（一八九五）五月公緩題記二條云：「章君式之據祝心淵孫秋實及陽湖趙惠甫讀本三家合校，今由式之本過批」。前王序四十年。又續集尾有題「黃興元記」三條，其一云：「此程蒲孫庶常定盫文集句讀本也。從原刻錄定公自記，間附已說，江建霞京卿曾錄之，今又過臨一通」。可見彙錄評跋早在四十年前已有公紱其人，又在一九〇九以前不知多少年有黃興元其人（或是一而二），則是王氏造作誣罔以欺人了。</p>
<p>此本較國學扶輪社本所增的僅是補注工夫。這或是王氏的功績。但是這些補注來歷不明，擅自改竄，是很錯誤的。今歸納幾條通例如下</p>
<p>一，取材不當—這一條是王氏全書的通病，就是他儘用了些間接的材料。例如文集莊公神道碑銘篇注卷上頁二七八「吳昌綬曰，「戊戌歲，莊卿珊館定公家，爲言其祖莊公存與事行之美，且曰碑文未具。已卯定公之京師，識莊公外孫宋于庭，復爲推測公志，至是歲不盡三日始屏棄人事總羣言而刪舉其大者撰莊公神道碑銘」。吳氏的話載所撰年譜中，未明言其根據。今有陳澧手批的定盫初集發現其書載定盫自記多條，莊公神道碑銘條云：「嘉慶戊寅莊君綬甲館予家，一夕爲予言其祖事行之美，且曰：「碑文未具」。是夕綬甲夢見公者再，若有所托狀，明日綬甲以爲請，越已卯識公外孫宋翔鳳，翔鳳則爲予推測公志如此。越壬午歲不盡三日，始屏棄人事總羣言而刪舉其大者以報公，自記」。定盫初集流傳本絕少，吳氏自謂「搜獲一册一。則年譜所言，即本於定盫自記可知。自記其作文年月爲「壬午歲不盡三日」，故吳氏稍採其言編於年譜道光二年壬午之下，易「壬午」二字爲「是歲」，乃爲行文之便，避去繁複。而王氏不察，沿其文，讀者是决不了解的。又吳氏文中戊戌爲乾隆四十三年，定盫未生，或爲道光十八年，距道光三年癸未刻初集時已十五年，顯知其誤，自記作「戊寅」爲嘉慶二十三年，距壬午作文時歷五年之久正是。而王氏一仍吳氏之誤。因定盫初集，不易見到而錄用間接材料，還有可說，但有許多明出本集的，依蓓錄用它。如已亥雜詩第一百四十首注，「吳昌綬曰：「定公曩在北陳北直種桑之策於幾輔大吏，過蘇州則陳吳中水利策於魯山布政。民物之懷，固無時不睠睠也」」。吳氏語即據雜詩第廿一首原題。「　在北陳北直種桑之策於幾輔大吏」，及第一百四十首原題，「陳吳中水利策於同年裕魯山布政」而成。王氏反引他的話作注，不知有何益處。王氏的補注，多取吳氏年譜。同時吳氏年譜多據本集爲說。王氏可謂錯認了娘家了。</p>
<p>二，引證不當—這可說是穿聲附會。如文集卷下頁一一知歸子讚篇注，「定公不得意而逃於禪，好西方之書，自謂造深微，故作此鑽」。按魏源古微堂外集卷三定盫文錄叙有云，「（定盫）晚尤好西方之書，自謂造深微云」。顯然王氏的話是錯鈔了這兩句的。知歸子讚作成的年月，不得而知。但此篇已列入定盫初集卷下，可見它雖不屬早年的作品，總是道光三年以前的。那時定盫尙不不得意而逃於禪」，尙不「自謂造深微」，怎有如王氏所云「故作此讚」？定盫晚年佛學的成績，在今鄧實刻的定盫別集，這一篇讚是不够格來關合定盫自己的話的。</p>
<p>三，節錄不當—如雜詩第八首注，「戴醇士曰：此山不語看中原，是眞能道西山情性矣」。按戴氏語見其所撰習苦齋畫絮卷二，原文云：一龔祠部定盫嘗語予曰！「西山有時渺然隔雲漢外，蒼然墮几榻前，不關風雨晴晦也』。其西山詩云：「此山不語看中原」，是眞能道西山性情矣」。我們讀戴氏原文極淸楚，但被王氏截斷以後，就無頭無尾了。</p>
<p>王氏十多年治龔學的成績—這些補注，可以說」無價値的。注釋本也是文學批評（廣義的）的一種，極重要。但是科學的注釋，它的方法必須考證的，態度必須忠實的，材料必須直接的（沒有直接，也當鈔錄全文）。不幸王氏這部補注，立了正相反的一面，所以是最不科學的，最不利於學者研究的。</p>
<p>又此本自矜爲「足本」，也是騙人。如果在一九〇九年，國學扶輪社出版的龔定盫全集，說這句話是一點也不誇大的。但這是一九三五年版，在這二十多年中又發現了許多遺文，據我此刻所知，就有完完整整的兩部。一是鄧實刻的定盫別集（一九一〇），在風雨樓叢書中；一是張祖廉刻的定盫遺着及定盫年譜外紀（一九二一），在娟鏡樓叢刊中。又比較早一點的有羽琌山民軼事，在國學叢刊中，可以與年譜相參證。定盫文拾遺多是其學術論著，此可收入，其他若段注說文札記（續經解中）也可收入。總之，這部全集無增於一九〇九年的國學扶輪社本的，不能算爲足本。</p>

<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>（四）總經理</p>
<p>在各書店中，總經理的職權和地位各不相同，道是由於書店組織的性質所决定。在名義上，總經理的職權和地位是在書店中至高無上的，而在實際上，雖有的書店是如此，但也有和一般小夥計無異者。其所以如此的緣故，是由於總經理的產生方式所决定。如總經理就是這書店的老闆，那末總經理的職權不但至高無上，而且也和其書店的壽命相始終。如北新的李氏兄弟，上海雜誌公司的張老闆，以及開明的章老闆等，都是老闆或是創辦人而兼總經理的。另方面，完全由於儷傭——不，完全由於聘請而來的總經理，有權的固不少，而無所爲的也很冬。如以前世界的沈知方先生，已去世的現代的洪雪帆先生，他們在其書店中，都是很有權威的，幾和那些「獨資老闆兼任總經理」無異。此外，我們知道的，商務的王雲五先生，差不多可說是「狄克推多」，現在生活的鄒總理，職權也極大，據說鄒氏回國時，生活同人的歡迎會上，一片我們的總理」之歌頌聲，盛况爲出版界空前所未有，而同時，來無所爲，去無所由的總經理，也所在多是，如以前新月的總經理，差不多隔多少天換一個，現在華通的總經理究是誰，也常使人捉摸不定。</p>
<p>每個新書店的工作，有二大部份，一部份是出書，別一都份是營業，如何推進營業，自然是總經理份內之事，而於出版方面，則未免有些問題。除了那些無所謂的總經理，根本上無權過問出版情形外，重要的原因還是每個總經理，對於出版未必和對於營業同樣的有經騐。試問，在各書店的總經理中，都能如王雲五先生似的，在國外一個月中能遍閱數千本科學管理法的究有幾個？所以，在總經理與總編輯之間，未免常有齟齬，不是總經理想去過問出版事宜而總編輯不願，就是總經理與總編輯之間對於出版意見的不合。因爲，總經理是偏於「生意眼」上面，而總編輯對於「生意眼」未必有什麼經騐，這是衝突的主要點。（未完）</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>在這工業落後的中國，不要說大工業不見發展，卽如小工業也很幼稚，倘和歐美各國比較，到處是相形見絀，十分慚愧，吾和陳蝶仙先生時常談到這點，陳先生很有興趣的竭力提倡。最近顧炳元君自歐美考察工業回國，很稱贊他們的小工業，可以把「玲瓏精巧恰到好處」八個字來形容一切的用品，顧君帶了許多小件工藝品，給我們國貨界研究，如菜刀，切果刀，去殼盒·除油垢·免縐摺·拋光·取火·造花·採光等關於衣食住行上的小物件，都覺得別出心裁，玲瓏小巧，價格旣便宜，應用尤切要。一皿一器，都是他們小工業的產物，人人贊美樂用。吾看有許多小物件，仿造很便。顧君購歸以貢獻於國貨界，分別說明用意尤可敬佩。卽如茶烟一小包裝璜旣美，又加以精詳的仿單；說明煮法效用，倒可以售得好價。希望國貨界同人就專營的事業，於分別仿造之外，再運以新頴之花樣，與奇巧之功用，各出心力，各就專長，創造種種小工藝，以供社會的需用，無使舶來品物，佔據市塲。張伯苓先生言「歐美人是創造，日本人是仿造，中國人則不造。」現日本人已由仿造而至創造之一步，我中國人將長此停頓於不造之中，坐享他人已成之物，何以對人，何以處己？有志小工業的同志，趕快起來吧！</p>
<h3 id="c168">幣制改革後的國貨前途 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>醞釀了許久的改革幣制問題，終於在本月四日，由財部的一紙命令，而官吿實施了，這是我國政府對於中國整個經濟上的一大改革，而對於我們國貨工業的影響，尤其是含有促進和保護的最大效用，値得我全體從事國貨事業的人們，有共同起來加以注意，而檢討其因果的必要。</p>
<p>因爲中國本是個入超的國家，所以，國際問收支的永遠不能平衡，到最後是只有出之於拿現銀去償付的一法，而這幾年起，正是爲了上述的原因，使白銀滾滾外流，中國存銀有罄盡的危機，整個民族經濟的解體，成了指顧問事，因此。這次政府的毅然决然實行新幣制，採用注幣和禁止現金使用，正是要企圖管理通貨，安定金融，使白銀得以集中，整個的工商業，可進入了一個新的階段，尤其是我午國貨事業，一方面可因了外匯平價的降低，使輸出貿易，可有活躍的趨勢，而洋貨進口，却相反地要增高成本，此後他難於再在我國市場傾銷，另一方面因於紙幣發行的統一，和準備的集中，通貨可無緊縮之虞，籌碼可以增加，信用可以擴張，使國貨事業，得能蓬勃發展，其他如實行新幣制後，可以刺激物價上漲，也是對於國貨前途有很大利益的。</p>
<p>雖然，我們從事國貨事業的，也不可過於樂觀，此後發展國貨的前途，還在在需要我們更大的審愼而進行，大家曉得。國貨工廠在現階段上，應走的路綫有二，第一，要努力趁時徐圖進取，謀對外對內市塲的擴展，使出口事業的進步，和注意外匯平價降低後的洋貨進口行動，與之作强有力的競爭和週旋，因爲外貨自身成本的受了抬高，在這一次裏，務須推翻他在華市塲的潛勢力，而以國貨替代之。第二，要設法藉此計劃廠商本身的擴大，趁這通貨流通，籌碼增多，信用擴張的時候，力謀增進廠商更大的生產力，和改良出品的精美，銷售技術的改進，使設備一切，多日趨合理化。</p>
<p>總之，這次幣制的改革無疑義地是有利於整個工業界的繁榮的進行，但，最需要的還要我們廠商們自身的努力，値此良好的機會中，務須力謀國內外市塲的開拓，和健全本身組織，鞏固外界的信用，使建立一個最堅强的民族產業的基礎。</p>

<p>— 子明</p>
<p>近來國人，鑒於外貨傾銷，農村經濟破產，國脈垂危，大家羣起提倡國貨。可是我們平心靜氣來檢查過去的成績，恐怕很難使人滿意吧！只因爲提倡儘提倡，外貨仍是服用：這很是痛心的！但是提倡國貨，沒有嚴密的組織，也是落空的。現在民衆最切的組織是保甲，如果運用來作提倡國貨運動，總比紙上談兵高幾倍吧？—茲將運用保甲方法寫在下面：</p>
<p>將提倡服用國貨的事情，提到保甲會議裏去討諭，實施方法不厭其詳的列舉出來，當衆議决通過以後，一面載入保甲規約內，由保甲長署名蓋章，戶長也要加入簽名，懸於公共處所，並將副本呈存區公所。一面將服用國貨與社會復興之意義，由保長曉諭甲長，甲長曉諭戶長，戶長曉諭全家人，一體遵行。</p>
<p>在開始服用國貨之日，各鄉鎭保甲長，舉行聯合宣誓大典，由區長指導，縣長監誓：同時歡迎民衆參加。經過宣誓以後，除戶長對甲長，甲長對保長，保長對鄉鎭長，鄉鎭長對區長具切結擔保不用外貨外，還須互具運保切結，以資互相監督，一旦發現故違情事，馬上按級呈區受最厲之懲處。</p>
<p>區公所職員固以身作則，服用國貨：另派國貨稽查員，隨時密赴各地調查指導。我想，這辦法，如具决心，實行起來，一定是有効的！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c202">從「缺乏牛油」到「獲得新領土」 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 方殷</p>
<p>據報載：德國經濟部長沙赫特，最近發表演說，其中有謂：</p>
<p>「目前德國牛油，極威缺乏，頗値吾人之注意。當知吾國對外輸出，倘不能增加，則國內日常消耗品，卽無法取給；吾國斷不能永遠受此痛苦，當爲外國人士所諒解。救濟之策，一方面在于增進國內之生產，一方面尤在于獲得新領土：吾人所需原料，有取給之地。因此，僅就缺乏牛油之一事而論，卽足以證明吾人所要求之正當」云云。</p>
<p>當目前正是世界經濟恐慌愈形急劇的時候，帝國主義者希圖從原料供給地和新市塲之獲得，以解除本身之危機，這是亳不爲奇的。然而，歐戰以后，全世界的殖民地都已分割凈盡，德國是戰敗的國家，以前的屬地旣已爲戰勝國所奪去，所以當今日經濟恐慌愈鬧愈烈的情形之下，使它最感到痛苦的，自然就是國外市塲和原料供給地的缺乏了。沙赫特之這一席話，不用說也正是爲此而發的。不過，我們不能不馬上聯想到：德國旣可以爲「缺乏牛油」而需要「獲得新領土」，那末，他國也未必不爲了什麼缺乏而要求「獲得新領土」的，但是到底誰的領土該劃入誰的「新領土」內呢？——我想，這，除掉再來一個大屠殺的火拼之外，恐怕不會有別的新花樣了。</p>
<p>不過，這個火拼，受累的自然不是任何帝國主義者的本身，而是一般弱小民族和無辜的勞苦大衆，因爲只有他們才會被當作大戰的砲灰和分割的俎肉的</p>
<p>在歐戰和平紀念的十七週年，聽了沙赫特這一席話，不禁使人觸起歐戰時慘酷的回憶。</p>

<p>破曉的街市在朦朧的晨曦下躺着，根生和他老婆却已在第三次的晨鷄報曉聲中離開了那溫暖的被窩，根生是挾了一捲灰白色的布帆向石橋頭河浜裏走去，他的老婆帶著一隻伙食籃，掮了一枝櫓，跟着根生走到那隻半已壞舊的小船上，稍稍收拾了一回；根生就跳上岸去喊開船了；而她却在火艙裏「行灶」上，生了火燒起早飯來。</p>
<p>那個小鎭市上還是靜悄悄的，只有那市梢的一爿打鐵舖子裏，一個學徒正在打着呵欠懶懶把那破爛排門一塊一塊的脫下來。幾家茶館門的雖然是早已敞着的，但除了堂倌們在嘓嘟嘓嘟的拉着風箱生爐子外，幾隻板桌上也還是靜靜地不像再過一個鐘頭，就會熟鬧起來的樣子。</p>
<p>「小菜船開啦！西山去的小菜船開啦」！根生在幾條巷裏叫了兩轉，他就回到船上來坐在後梢呼着熱茶，拍着潮烟等待。</p>
<p>這時浜裏停着的幾隻小航船和貨船還把船篷蓋得緊騰騰的彷彿沒有人住着，篷面上舖着一層嚴霜，白得像昨夜曾</p>

<p>經落一次小雪似的；河埠上也仍不見一個人來洗東西。</p>
<p>天空漸漸地也亮起來了，漫霧也在慢慢兒的收歛，花穿嶺的山峯也從乳白色的霧氣里露出來。</p>
<p>不久，那些賣小菜的人，也陸陸續續地挑着一担一担各式各樣的小菜向着河埠頭來了：那小菜有土產有客貨，　靑菜蘿蔔，芋艿葱蒜，以及魚肉之類。他們將担子歇了下來，提着遞給了根生，根生的老婆也帮着將一籃一籃的東西裝進了中央的一隻大艙裏，裝了滿滿的一艙。接着人也別另卜卜跳了下來，把一些扁担全塞進了乾塘裏，那隻小船給晨撼得搖蕩不已，人站在船面上也得互相攙扶着，不然就有給搖得翻身到水裏去的危險！</p>
<p>這樣一隻小船，載重本來是極其有限的；現在裝了十多擔小菜還要趁十多個人，所以船舷只露得三寸來往在水面上，如果再下一寸許要乾塘裏也進水了。</p>
<p>大家到了船上，全噪噪嚷嚷的喧嘩着，有的在胸脯頭摸出一支已經軋皺的劣等捲烟來抽着，有的是儘扯起了作裙角抹着額角上的汗，在額角上却還在不住地冒着熱氣，彷彿似剛出蒸籠的饅頭。於是適纔靜寂的週遭，這時也有了生氣。</p>
<p>「還有人嗎，好開船了」？張阿興似問似催般的向根生說。</p>
<p>「今天阿金　哈到現在還不來？」根生的老婆是每天記得有幾　人來乘船的，她今天在全船的人中打量了一下覺得少了一個人，她側着腦袋想了想，發現是收乾金沒有來，因此她就向兩頭和尙這樣問。</p>
<p>「他是不來了，昨晚他女人已產啦！」兩頭和尙陰陽怪氣的回答。</p>
<p>「她養了麼，養的哈？」這是阿金女人的堂叔，所以很關心的問。</p>
<p>「聽說是個男吧！——不過產娘不大好。」</p>
<p>根生上岸去把鎖在野桑樹上的練條開了，回來收起跳板，拿篙子往石塘上輕輕地點了兩下，船身就向河心裏橫了過去。他領　了篙子再用力撑了幾篙，那隻小船便很聽命令似地望着河口行去。他將篙子擱下了，運忙跨過去放下了右側的繞頭，便走到後梢來帮着老婆上了櫓搖着。</p>
<p>出了口，他們覺得這陣東南風頗有點力，把舵放了下去，掛起了那塊灰白色的布帆，讓它順着風去淌。</p>
<p>十幾位小菜客人是分列着兩邊船舷挨坐着，根生却很悠閒地倚着舵牙喝起燒酒來。</p>
<p>太湖的東面，這時纔見一輪朝陽像一個紅蛋似的從水平綫下面滾了上來，晨風是習習地在布帆上吹着，把那隻小船更推行得快了些。</p>
<p>洞庭西山的標渺峯頭頂已在吐着一縷一縷的白烟，他們知道西山人亦都在炊早飯了；接着鎭夏港裏那條漫長的浜渚也慢慢地在船邊爬了過去。</p>
<h3 id="c204">徐州一夜 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>我們這回搭的是軍用車，本來預計在當天正午可到徐州，然後再轉搭開到蚌埠去的車子，在那裏逗留一二天。可是當列車還沒到徐州的時侯，車窗外的樹林已跟天色溶成一片，到蚌埠的車子自然早就開了，這樣，我們不得不在徐州暫過一夜。</p>
<p>我們帶着簡單的行李沿着一條碎石舖成的馬路走，終於在一家房錢很便宜的客棧住下來。客棧裏的夥計一面忙着跟我們打水，冲茶解被包，一面又嘮嘮叨叨的儘說些不着邊際的閒話。等到把所有的事作好之後，他就陪着笑臉向我的朋友（他是一位軍官）說：</p>
<p>「副官，哈哈，今天您老累了一天，阿要叫一位姑娘：……」她故意讓他那生硬的笑聲掩住下半截的話，自然他亦用着狐疑的眼色打量着我們。</p>
<p>「等會兒再說吧。」我的朋友用這話把他打發開去，一面就對我說：</p>
<p>「徐州的窰子眞是太多了」，他用手彈着馬靴的後跟，似乎是很熟悉的樣子。「眞是太多了，因爲這裏是隴海同津浦兩路交叉的地方，每一天不曉得有多少兵士要開到這裏來，要從這裏開出去。」他是一個「徐州通」，他前後到過徐州七八次了。</p>
<p>我好奇地聽着他講述這裏的窰子的一切，我亦回想起剛才在馬路上那些打扮得花枝招展，滿身香水氣味的女人。</p>
<p>「對了，那些就是窰子。」朋友說：「好些都是江北姑娘，性情怪直爽的，不過沒有南方的來得活潑。」</p>
<p>我的朋友是一個從死裏翻過好幾回筋斗的人，所以他總是冷冰冰的，對什麼都沒有半點同情心，自然，他亦時常「玩」過那些所謂「娘兒」們的。</p>
<p>我們正在談得起勁的時候，驟然，有人在門外站住了。玻璃窗門上印上了　一個人影。接着門輕輕地開了，一位身段很苗條的女人走了進來。</p>
<p>「先生，唱一隻曲吧？」他低着頭，惘然地揉着手裏的手巾，聲音是陰沉而且抖顫。過了會，他又抬起頭來，用凄冷！不是乞憐的眼光掃着我們兩人，低低的說：「先生，唱一隻什麼曲嗎？」</p>
<p>她的面色十分蒼白，在黯淡的小旅舍的燈光之下，那孱瘦的臉龐像一朶將謝的白薔薇。我的朋友似乎給她這罕有的態度怔住了，過了好半天，才緩緩的說：「不要的。」</p>
<p>她停了好一會，就把擱在桌上的手收下來，悄悄地退出去。她的背影就像黑暗裏的幽靈一般，隨着就在門外隱沒了去。</p>
<p>朋友本來正在脫掉馬靴，這時候亦有點惘然了，失神地反覆自語着說：「這姑娘，有點怪！這姑娘，有點怪！」</p>
<p>「這大槪是一個初見世面的姑娘」，接着他對我說。「又羞澀，又胆怯，看她的樣子就曉得，要不是，我想，玩玩亦……不說，不說了，咱們明天七點就起身，要是你早點醒來，不要忘了叫我。」</p>
<h3 id="c205">「天好日頭出」 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 史維之</p>
<p>生當盛世的現在，怎樣做人？這問題在我心頭是盤桓了久矣了的，但是一直沒决定，沒决定的原因，或許倒是爲了設想得太週到，覺得什麼都行不通，覺得什麼都行不通，於是便不免彷徨起來了。</p>
<p>例如許席珍先生所說的「天好日頭出」的「小丑」態度吧，「面面週到，不會得罪人」，法至善矣，然而「講來講去，結果還是等於沒有講」：這種「結果還是等于沒有講」的所謂圓活，我就不敢舉起手來贊同。「圓滑」固然是不妨作爲處世之方的《部份，但若到處圓活，到處「講來講去，結果還是等于沒有講」，不犧牲自己的主張，就亳無辦法解决。</p>
<p>其實就算是肯犧牲自己的主張吧，也不一定能够「面面週到」。我們姑且以舊事來做例子罷，對於藝術的主張，過去是有「爲藝術而藝術」和「爲人生而藝術」兩種主張的，這兩種主張那個對呢？但是要做到「面面週到」，那可就難了，說「爲藝術而藝術」對吧？主張「爲人生而藝術」的就不能够「週到」，反過來吧，主張「爲藝術而藝術」的又不能够「週到」，都不對是不敢說不提。說是都對吧，兩面不討好，結果還是要「得罪」。</p>
<p>所以，「天好日頭出，雨落階沿濕」，也就祗能成爲「小丑」在戲台上的揷科打諢。</p>
<p>况乎，「小丑」在戲台上的揷科打諢，至多也祗是扮一個鬼臉讓台下的太太先生們嘻嘻哈哈一陣子，認爲尙識趣，不討厭，要比這再好一點的好感是沒有的；不比「言論正生」，長篇大論的固然使人頭痛，但是有時使人頭痛的長篇大論，反而使太太先生們更不容易忘記。</p>
<p>固然，「言論正生」的「長篇大論」，也祗是「長篇大論」而已，於事實是無大補的，眞正幹的倒是那些手執令箭的「武生」，或是雖是「手無縛鷄之力」而有武力做後盾的「軍師」，然而較之于「小丑」，有時在觀衆方面可反而見重得多。雖然「小丑」有的是「面面週到」的「鬼臉」。</p>
<h3 id="c206">太平廟 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>這個小鎭旣沒有水埠頭夜航船可以這達縣城，走旱道還是要繞過隣鎭才有路可通；如果在軍事上，那是最險要的地勢了：入鎭能守，出鎭能攻。但是在農事上是最吃虧的地方了，這里的田地卽是以最低的價格出售，還是沒有主顧敢冒危險來榻便宜貨的。因爲做出來的米要運達到縣城里，除了人力挑着走就沒有其他的辦法，路程又是那樣地遙遠，從早晨出發，晚上恐怕走不了一半路，假如鄉下人不肯還租，祗有佃主的犧牲了。</p>
<p>歷代沿傳下來，這小鎭上都是自耕農了。至於他們是否從佃主那里抵賴過來，或者出價收買，已經無從考計了。這個僻居在角落里的小鎭，就像從前的部落那樣閉關自守，不和外界往來。但是每年的春天，這鈸上的太平廟必集資出一次會；廟曰太平，出會的意義，自然是保佑這鎭上一年的太平了，據說那太平爺確是有求必應的。這鎭地勢較高於隣鎭，却是，無論各鎭旱災水災，這里每冬是很好的豐收，，鎭上人說起來是太平爺的威靈所在。所以，到了每年出會的時候，想分一份太平爺的威靈的愚夫愚婦，寗願趕上二天的旱路，從各地地來參加這個「太平會」。而且惟恭惟敬，在出發前必先齋戒沐浴，茹素三日，在路上，卽是夫婦，也分別住宿。由此，可見太平廟在這一帶地方的威名了。</p>
<p>但是，你抱了遊歷名勝的雄心而去探望這太平廟，那是將給你重大的失望的。廟是一間東倒西塌的破屋，沒有廟門，有一個年老的廟祝厮守着這尊已經露了泥質本相的太平爺。踏進廟檻，太平爺居中鎭坐的這間屋，就算叫牠殿吧，抬起頭來，有幾處屋樑上可以望見天。而一切屬於廟宇的附屬品，如皂隸，迴避肅靜等硬牌，什麼都是沒有的。祗有太平爺坐在正中，（因爲正中的屋樑完好無缺，否則，我想也會請牠屆居到蛛綱滿佈的屋角落里的。）面前是一張少了一條腿的半桌，有一隻香爐：此外，是一條餓狗似的倦伏在太平爺脚下的廟祝了。</p>
<p>到了出會的時候，太平爺被兩根粗竹夾住了身體，由兩個壯健的農夫像從廟里偷出來那樣地沿着全鈸飛跑，想分一份太平爺威靈的遠道來客也撤脚在後面追，名曰「趕太平」。廟祝的生活就依賴着「趕太平」的玩意兒每年敷衍過去，因爲這一份香燭錢爲數很可觀。</p>
<p>太平爺和廟祝每年享受着這份太平羹，直到某年戰着，當軍隊槃據　鈸的時候，這位成靈的太平爺及太平廟都燬於砲火之下。鈸上農民在戰事結束後歸來，獨有那位年高的廟祝不知下落，恐怕亦爲他的相依爲命的太平爺殉葬了。</p>
<p>現在這鎭上不復有太平廟的一點形跡了，那一望無際的稻甲，在各省各縣鬧着嚴重的水災旱災的這數年之中，鎭上每年還是豐收，自然太平爺的威靈在他們的記憶中已磨滅殆盡了。不過隣鎭遭到災？說是沒有重建太平廟的關係。</p>

<p>滿目凄凉</p>
<p>社會是這樣的淫蕩，人心是這樣頹傷，抬頭一看，滿目凄凉！屋子里裝滿顏色，屋子里裝滿肉香，不知多少靑年被埋葬！</p>
<p>有了手，不去應川，就和沒有手一樣；魔宮呀！我的丈夫，活活被你埋葬！有了腿，不知向上，就和沒有腿一樣；我的丈夫，活活被你埋葬！霓虹燈光，燦爛輝煌，麻醉了他的心房；酒的瀉香，肉的芬芳，迷住了他的志向；失去了，一切希望；帶回了，一重重，怨恨懊喪；抬起頭，滿目凄凉，低了頭，遍地滄桑</p>
<p>有了腦，不去思想，就和沒有腦一樣；沒有腦，殘廢一樣，一切都成絕望！有了力，不去工作，就和殘廢瘋癱一樣；只享樂！不能久長，一生只有悲傷！情歌齊響，艷曲悠揚，蒙住了他的思想；眉的飛舞色的奔放，埋葬了他的剛强；靑年啊！國家多難；已不是，笙歌燕舞的時光！靑年啊！睜開眼來看一看，滿目凄凉！</p>

<p>……不能不注意</p>
<p>「時勢英雄」全劇經歷的年期，佔住了世界歷中上兩大紀錄：</p>
<p>一，第一次世界大戰。</p>
<p>二，驚動世界的侵略風雲。</p>
<p>在這兩大紀錄時墊動態中，當然能造成許多英雄；不過本劇所描寫的，不是戰塲上的英雄，是商塲上的英雄。全劇由這位英雄由時勢而成功寫起，直寫到這位英雄因時勢而失敗爲止。</p>
<p>以下接第三版</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>「　　是武器」（StageIs　　　00h），這是別國人重視戲劇昨一句　喻。那末把握着這一種武器而努力戲劇的人，應當研究如何善用這武器。善用這武器的目的，務要使戲劇的演出，能對羣衆有所指示，能使社會國家獲得利益。我們攝製「時勢英雄」和攝製「凱歌」兩部戲，可說是站在上述目的的立塲上。</p>
<p>中國農村的崩潰，和工商業的衰落，已成爲無可諱言的事實；這是中國經濟上的大間題，也是中國民族國家存亡的大間題，如果沒有方法去解决這大問題，即使中國能不受砲火鐵蹄壓迫而滅亡，也必受經濟壓迫而滅亡。</p>
<p>「時勢英雄」是屬於工商業方面的一個問題劇，在這個問題劇中，包含了兩種原因；第一個原因，表演民族資本受國際資本壓迫的結果，第二個原因，表演中國人心理上無形內戰的自殺。——惠登銀行壓迫振興紗廠，孫仲貴壓迫趙德雄。</p>
<p>中國工商業所以衰落這一個間題，所包含的原因，當然非常複雜。决不止「時勢英雄」戲劇中所演出的兩種原因，但是要救工商業，要復興工商業，必須把各種原因都設法解决。我們把持了上述兩種原因，攝成了「時勢英雄」的問題劇，想用這問題劇來刺激羣衆，以求覜衆心理上的答案。</p>
<p>現在我們想更進一步努力，要徵集關於解决問題的意見，作爲攝製「時勢英雄」續集材料。很希望已受痛苦的工商界，敎育界和智識階級，都願不吝賜敎的來表示意見，尤希望能有解决問題，鼓勵自覺的劇本。使我們所把持比舞臺更大的武器，能爲有益於國家和社會的應用。</p>
<p>我們應明白，對於世界人羣和一切的支配權，最初是屬於武力，其後是風於文化，現在是屬於經濟了。如果對於防禦侵略，建設生產的營壘——工商業——空呼崩潰或衰落的口號，而不爲啟發自覺，策勉奪鬭的指示，袖着袖坐視他重毀，這是驅逐營壘裏的人，去做對於個人自殺，對於事業自殺，對於國家自殺的悽慘工作。</p>
<p>這種悽慘事實的實現，當然爲大家所不忍看見，更不忍使此悽慘事實成爲地圖變色的因素，坐視國家陷於比印度高麗的境界。</p>
<p>我們希望我們的呼聲，能得到超乎娛樂牲的同情觀衆，能多得到對我們表示意見的同情觀衆。</p>
<h3 id="c213">關於船家女 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>沈西苓編導的「船家女」，描寫婦女解放運動的悲喜劇，有聊齋一般的趣味，有改善社會的意義，是値得注意的佳構，現在已送京審查，一俟通過，即可與觀衆相見了。</p>
<p>沈西苓在他编導的「船家女」中，用最美的角度，最藝術的開　拉之眼，介紹了西湖的妙處，西子湖中的微波盪漾，烟柳朦朧，六橋三竺，蘇堤斷橋，湖中勝景，參以人間悲歡離合事，眞是一首抒情之詩，一幅寫生之畫。</p>
<p>「船家女」是老高徐來初次合作的作品，老高飾織工鐵兒，徐飾船家女郞阿玲。這兩個劇中人的個性，可以說，和老高徐來是再不能更適合的了。你看他們在銀幕上笑着，嘆息着，默默地流着淚，你會不知不覺的陪着他們歡笑悲啼，好像那幕上人物，原是你自己。—他們在「家女」中的表情，是簡直達到了忘我的境地。—尤其是徐來，『她從來沒有做過這樣好的戲！』看過試片的人這樣說。</p>

<p>福斯影片公司，自與二十世紀公司合併後，勢力愈加雄厚，該公司之「賴婚」，方在大光明上映，而名滿歐美的嶄新女明星杜泰勞爾芙及克拉夫勃洛克合演的「異想天開」DressedtoThrill，又將於今天（星期四）起，在國泰公映。這是一個詼諧有趣的羅曼斯，叙述一個男性，同時戀着一位小家碧玉和一位劇臺明星，不料二人即爲一人，於是趣料層出不窮。</p>
<p>「賴婚」在大光明間映的第一天，竟賣滿座，其唯一原因，係由於電影本身技術上之進步，復有音響和更好的攝影來完成牠，較之十年前無聲片的時代，自有其更受人歡迎的條件，但聞該院因派拉蒙之歌舞鉅片「萬星拱照」，早經排定明日（星期五）起映，「賴婚」祇能映至今日爲止，愛好那樣道德上的悲劇的朋友，可不要錯過這最後的機會。</p>

<h3 id="e9">International Movement to Eliminate War <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The current world situation is perilous. Whether in Europe or in the Far East, it hangs by a thread. Governments everywhere are racking their brains to deal with the crisis. The League of Nations has scheduled the imposition of sanctions on Italy for the 18th of this month. The International Naval Conference is also scheduled to be held in London on December 5th. If these two measures fail, the militarists will inevitably become even more rampant, and a human catastrophe may be unleashed uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Amidst this call to eliminate war, British Foreign Secretary Hoare issued a diplomatic declaration stating that the British people are determined to abide by their solemn vows to Europe and to the world. He said, "This collective security policy is not only the political consciousness of the British government and public, but also the common will of the entire League of Nations. However, Britain, with its abundant resources and strong power, bears particularly heavy obligations and responsibilities to be fulfilled in the coming years." US President Roosevelt also announced his world policy on Armistice Day, saying that "the United States fully sympathizes with other countries' movements to eliminate war and consistently opposes the aggressive actions of ambitious individuals." He stated that "the dangers faced by all mankind in the future will be no less than those faced by the American people alone, and the greatest crisis is the contempt for sacred and solemn international treaties. The United States maintains international peace only by going all out." The determination of Britain and the United States to maintain world peace is evident here.</p>
<p>We have already discussed British policy extensively. Now, let's analyze the situation in the United States. The opinions within the United States can be broadly divided into three factions. The current Neutrality Act can be said to represent the opinions of those who advocate absolute avoidance of being drawn into the vortex of war. This holds considerable sway in Congress. Another faction, represented by former Secretary of State Stimson, believes that the Neutrality Act contains many dangers. As during the European War, President Wilson strictly adhered to neutrality for three years, but in 1917, he was forced by circumstances to enter the war to uphold the dignity of the nation. Therefore, they argue that the United States cannot seek peace without actively participating in collective action. Furthermore, the United States' responsibility should be to strive to prevent war, not to evade war. Only by assisting the world in preventing the outbreak of war can the United States avoid being drawn in. Between these two factions are government officials such as President Roosevelt and Premier Hull, who argue that the Neutrality Act should not be too strict and that the president should be granted discretionary power in its implementation so as to assist in world peace and not feel helpless as the League of Nations does with its current sanctions against Italy. Hull recently hinted in a speech at the intention to amend the Neutrality Act in the next Congress. This shows that US policy is still under much consideration and is unlikely to have any firm decisions for the time being. However, the current world situation, as President Roosevelt said, is such that international jealousy still exists, the expansion of armaments is increasing, and the ambitions of those who disrupt peace are not yet exhausted. If Britain and the United States do not adopt a radical solution or cannot abandon selfish ideas and resolutely plan for the security of the whole world, then by procrastinating and delaying until the final realization, the changes in the world will have reached an unimaginable point.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Sun Chuanfang Assassinated in Tianjin <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>A Sudden Change During a Scripture Lecture at the Jushilin; The Assassin is a Woman Seeking Revenge for Her Father; She Surrendered Calmly After the Incident; Printed Materials Were Carried in Advance and Distributed on the Spot</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Chuanfang, former commander of the Five-Province Allied Forces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian, was assassinated at the Buddhist Jushilin in Caocao'an Hutong, Tianjin, at 3:15 PM on the 13th, dying from three gunshots. The assassin was a woman in her thirties named Shi Jianqiao, the daughter of Shi Congbin, who was formerly in charge of Shandong military affairs. After the assassination, she distributed a "Letter to the Nation" and a small note at the scene and surrendered to the authorities. She was arrested and interrogated by the First Branch of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau and transferred to the Public Security Bureau that night. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Chuanfang was suddenly shot three times with a pistol by a young woman while lecturing at the Jushilin in Tianjin at approximately 4:00 PM this afternoon. All three shots hit vital points, and he fell to the ground and died immediately. The assailant did not flee, stating that she was the daughter of former Shandong Commander Shi Congbin and was seeking revenge for her father. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Chuanfang was assassinated and killed at the Jushilin on South Mach Road in Tianjin on the afternoon of the 13th. The assassin was the daughter of former Commander Shi Congbin, seemingly out of private revenge. The woman has now surrendered, and the truth of the case should be easily understood. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The small note distributed by Shi was printed with two poems on the front: 1. "I dare not forget my father's hatred for even a moment, and I grieve even more for the graying hair of my mother. Although I fear harming my kind mother's heart, the opportunity does not allow for further delay." 2. "I cannot bear to look back ten years ago, things remain the same, but the scenery has changed. I often come to the forest, not to worship Buddha, but Jianqiao seeks death, not immortality." (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The reverse side of the small note was printed with: "Attention, gentlemen: 1. Today, Shi Jianqiao, formerly known as Gu Lan, killed Sun Chuanfang to avenge her father, Shi Congbin. 2. For detailed information, please see my 'Letter to the Nation.' 3. The great revenge has been avenged, and I have immediately surrendered to the court. 4. The Buddhist hall is stained with blood, shocking everyone. I sincerely apologize to the Jushilin and all of you. Respectfully, Shi Jianqiao, the avenging daughter." Her "Letter to the Nation" was more than a thousand words long, stating that Shi Congbin was from Tongcheng, Anhui, and was captured by Sun Chuanfang ten years ago due to military defeat and killed in Bengbu. She had long planned revenge but had not had the opportunity until now, when she finally acted. (Telegraph on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Buddhist Jushilin was jointly established by Jin Yunpeng and Sun Chuanfang, with Jin as the head and Sun as the chairman. It was established in the Qingxiu Courtyard in Caocao'an Hutong. Sun had been living in Tianjin for years and went to the Jushilin daily to chant scriptures. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday around 2:00 PM, he would go with his wife, and sometimes with Jin. The assailant lived at No. 166, Tenth Road, in the British Concession in Tianjin. She had been married for ten years to Shi Jinggong, who is currently a deputy commander of a teaching group in the Jin Army. She has two sons, one seven and the other two years old. Half a month ago, she learned from a devotee at the Guanyin Temple that Sun was practicing Buddhism at the Jushilin while preparing for the tenth anniversary of her father's death. She then harbored a grudge and went to the Jushilin to listen to the teachings. She had gone four times, but Sun was not there. She went again at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th. The weather was cloudy and rainy. The Jushilin's dharma master, Xinghui, inquired whether Sun would come, because it was a dharma-teaching period. Sun replied hesitantly and suddenly arrived by car with his family at 3:00 PM. He immediately sat down next to the lecture platform to listen to the lecture. The assailant, because she had not brought a handgun, hurriedly hired a car to return to her residence to retrieve the gun. She re-entered the Jushilin at 3:15 PM and sat down behind Sun, about three feet away. She suddenly fired three shots. Two bullets hit the head, and the third hit the back, passing through the front of the heart. Sun immediately fell to the ground. The listeners were in chaos. The assailant shouted, "Don't be afraid!" She then took out pre-printed materials from her bosom and scattered them, and shouted, "My father's revenge has been avenged!" Sun's family members had not brought guns and hurriedly ran out to report to the police. The assailant calmly handed over the gun and was taken into custody. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The local court dispatched Prosecutor Tu Zhang at 5:00 PM to examine Sun Chuanfang's body. Sun died at 3:55 PM. One bullet in his head had not penetrated. He was transported back to his private residence on Nineteenth Road in the British Concession by a large automobile. He was washed and placed in a coffin that night and was 51 years old. He had four sons, two from his principal wife and two from his concubine. The eldest is studying at Yenching University in Beiping. The youngest is eight or nine years old. The assailant is burly, unlike a woman. After being arrested, she spoke frankly and without reservation. It is said that her cousin, Shi Zhongcheng, is currently a brigade commander in the Central Army, stationed in Anqing. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Yushu, director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, said that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was truly unexpected. The assailant has surrendered, but whether the case is so simple is under investigation. If there are no other issues, she will be sent to the court for trial. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>Maintain Current Status for Provinces Not Yet Using Legal Tender; Crack Down on Manipulative Merchants and Form Evaluation Committees; Establish Preparatory Sub-Branches in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the implementation of the new currency policy, various regions requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance on how to handle the situation. A large number of telegrams and documents were received, which can be roughly divided into two points: (1) How should remote provinces not yet using legal tender be handled? (2) How should the depreciation of the exchange rate between standard currency and subsidiary currency, as well as the rise in prices, be stabilized? The Ministry of Finance has provided detailed replies to both of these points. (1) Provinces not yet using legal tender are permitted to temporarily maintain their current status. Meanwhile, efforts have been made to transport legal tender to these regions for use. (2) To stabilize exchange rates and prices, local governments, in conjunction with people's organizations, will establish price evaluation committees to conduct appropriate price evaluations. Furthermore, military police and other agencies will severely crack down on speculative and unscrupulous elements disrupting the financial markets. It is now understood that the implementation of the methods approved by the Ministry of Finance in various regions has yielded very positive results. In addition, the Ministry of Finance, in order to facilitate the exchange of legal tender for the people, has formally requested the Ministry of Communications to instruct all postal remittance bureaus nationwide to serve as legal tender exchange agencies. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to unify issuance and consolidate the credit of legal tender, the Ministry of Finance established a Legal Tender Issuance Reserve Management Committee in Shanghai. Now, sub-branches are being established in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou to handle the issuance and exchange of legal tender locally and to manage and store the sub-reserve of legal tender. With the exception of the Guangzhou sub-branch committee member selection, which is still underway, the lists of committee members for the Tianjin and Hankou sub-branches have been officially announced. The sub-branch charter will be announced within days. The areas under the jurisdiction of the sub-branches will be based on the provinces and cities within the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River basins.

<p>(Beiping) The price of copper coins in Ping City continues to skyrocket, and the lives of ordinary people are greatly affected. The Municipal Government has decided to take effective measures to suppress the prices. Grain prices are gradually stabilizing, but there is no downward trend.

<p>(Jinan) This morning, Han Fuju summoned the Director of the Department of Finance, the Director of the Military Law Department, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and the Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Provincial Government and informed them that the government is determined to seek a livelihood for the majority of the poor. He stated that the prices of grain, rice, and coal have skyrocketed and decided to strictly suppress them. All prices must be restored to the original prices before the 3rd of this month. Violators will have their goods confiscated. Copper coins must also be restored to the original price of twenty-six large coins per dime. He also issued a general order to all county magistrates to check and seal the existing silver in the silver and money houses in each county, prohibiting it from being transported out. In this city, the Department of Finance, the Military Law Department, the Provincial Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Public Security Bureau were ordered to check and seal the existing silver in the banks and money houses, with the seals of the Provincial Government and the General Headquarters, prohibiting it from being transported out. Another order stated that the existing silver in this province must be kept within the province. Since the cash is not going out, the market should not be affected in any way.

The silver totals eight million two hundred thousand yuan, and the banknotes total seven million yuan. The existing silver is all sealed for safekeeping and will not be transported out. The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications telegraphed their respective head offices to transport one-yuan notes to Jinan as much as possible to replace existing currency. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Bao'an) The implementation of the new legal tender decree is proceeding smoothly. Merchants and civilians have been exchanging at the Central Bank and Bank of Communications in recent days. Because the market has been short of hard currency, the amount exchanged is only several hundred yuan. The Central Bank and Bank of Communications have now transferred a large amount of single-unit legal tender and four types of fractional notes (one dime, two dimes, two dimes and five cents, and five dimes) from the Central Bank of Pingjin for full exchange. Fractional notes from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Agriculture and Commerce, and Datong that are circulating in the market are still used as usual. The price of copper coins today is 420 to 430 coins. According to people in the financial sector, how the Central Bank and Bank of Communications will dispose of the existing silver will be decided after the establishment of the Tianjin Preparatory Sub-branch. The exchange rate had slightly increased recently due to the listing of cotton in various counties, but it has now stabilized. However, the customs of the people in various counties are conservative, and they do not fully understand the new legal tender decree. The Central Bank and Bank of Communications are now fully prepared for the exchange and can gradually promote the decree. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Anqing) Recently, due to the implementation of currency policies in Wanyuan (Anqing), the price of copper coins has skyrocketed, and commodity prices have soared. On the 13th, the Provincial Government instructed the Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction to convene a meeting with the County Government, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, and the Chamber of Commerce to discuss measures to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating the market.

<p>(Washington) Official circles remain silent on the situation in the Far East. Observers believe that the government thinks the adjustment of the critical situation in the Far East must wait until peace is restored in the Philippines. Officials stated that the United States will always abide by the Nine-Power Treaty and anticipate that the Far East problem will be adjusted one day. Well-informed observers here believe that the activities of the Japanese military authorities in China will not stop within the year because, at the beginning of next year, when the Japanese parliament convenes, the military must have something to stir up domestic sentiment so that the huge military budget can be passed in parliament. As for the Japanese military's plan in North China, it is being implemented one year earlier than planned due to the unrest in the world caused by the Italian-Ethiopian dispute.

According to existing neutrality laws, the United States must invoke self-defense measures, such as banning arms shipments and prohibiting American citizens from traveling on ships of belligerent countries, etc. Experts also said that any country that instigates aggression will naturally become an aggressor nation.

The places scheduled for inspection are Iloilo, Cebu, Zamboanga, Davao, Guam, Wake, Midway, Honolulu, and Hilo. He is expected to arrive in San Francisco in mid-December. It is rare in the past for the United States to send the Secretary of War to personally inspect Pacific fortresses. In addition, according to US Secretary of the Navy Swanson, the US Navy must make extraordinary preparations in this extraordinary time, that is, the personnel of surface fleets must maintain 85%, and submarine personnel must maintain 100%. Therefore, the budget for the next fiscal year will increase by 100,000 troops to strengthen the US military's combat power in the Pacific. (China United Press Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(London) The leaders of the two major parties made their final appeals to voters on the eve of the general election. Conservative Party leader Baldwin urged voters across the country to assist the government in continuing the work of national revival, with peace and security as the two major political programs. He also stated that the government is determined to faithfully manage domestic security and world peace, and will not spend a single penny on national defense except when necessary, and will continue to seek an international agreement on arms reduction in a world where collective security has become a solid guarantee against aggression. Labor Party leader Major Attlee issued a message to voters, stating that the Labor Party supports peace, democracy, and social justice, and makes them the foundation of domestic and foreign policy. He will earnestly implement the principle that all people are brothers and sisters, and if we strive to do good, victory will belong to our party. Those who predict the election results mostly say that the government will definitely win a majority, ranging from one hundred to one hundred and seventy.

<p>(Paris) According to the Business News, a confidant of German Führer Hitler's disarmament envoy Ribbentrop, named Abez, has arrived here from Berlin and will hold talks with various French figures. It is also heard that Ribbentrop himself will come to France soon to hold discussions with key figures in the French government. It is expected that the French-German talks will also discuss French-Russian relations. Germany's current attitude towards the Soviet Union has changed, and after German Economy Minister Schacht gave important commercial interests to the Soviet Union, Germany and Russia may even conclude a commercial treaty. Newspaper reports also say that Führer Hitler himself even wants to implement political cooperation with the Soviet Union. According to Morning News, French officials believe that the claim that Ribbentrop will come to France is premature, but they do not deny that he may come to France in the short term. French Ambassador to Germany Ponsot is currently in Paris and may discuss the possibility of French-German cooperation with Prime Minister Laval. German Ambassador to France Köster recently requested Laval to schedule a meeting, presumably to discuss French-German relations as well. Morning News also said that Abez's visit to France has no political significance and is only aimed at establishing a "French-German Cultural Association," which is clearly inconsistent with what Business News reported.

<p>(Rome) The talks between British Ambassador Drummond and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today have rekindled optimistic air about a solution to the European crisis. After the talks, the Italian Foreign Ministry issued a communiqué stating that "the situation in the Mediterranean is still under study." Although this communiqué is ambiguous, according to a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, there will be further meetings in the future. Therefore, diplomatic circles believe that the discussions between the two sides may have yielded some results. At the same time, news was received here from Asmara that Antalo, sixteen miles south of Magale, will soon fall.

The list of prohibited exports is substantially the same as the major raw materials opened by the League of Nations Sanctions Adjustment Committee, so it can be regarded as beneficial to the League of Nations' sanctions plan. However, officials stated that the announcement of this ban was entirely due to the domestic economic situation because it is necessary to preserve raw materials in the country. The list includes food, oil, textiles, iron, rubber, and leather. Arms and armaments have been included in the previous ban. The export of copper and kerosene was controlled before the outbreak of the war in Africa. (National News Agency Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Italian government sent protest notes to the governments of various countries participating in sanctions yesterday. Therefore, some parties are deeply afraid that after the economic sanctions are implemented, Italy may retaliate by withdrawing from the League of Nations. However, people in the League of Nations believe that the Italian protest note does not contain the intention of withdrawing from the League of Nations. If the country thinks this move is beneficial, it can do it sooner rather than later. Now that it has been delayed until now, it shows that it does not want to do so. As for the implementation procedure of economic sanctions, since it has been formulated, it will not be changed due to Italian protests and will still be implemented on the original date, that is, November 18. The Adjustment Committee has entrusted Chairman Vasconcelos to monitor the progress of sanctions. If difficulties are encountered, he should solicit opinions from experts from various countries. The eighteen-nation subgroup committee must be convened only when major accidents occur. The League of Nations Secretariat and the Adjustment Committee have not received this Italian protest note. However, Italy denies that the Adjustment Committee is a formal organization of the League of Nations, and this protest note may not be delivered to the committee. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The British authorities are dealing calmly with the Italian government's note to various countries protesting sanctions and threatening to implement retaliation plans. The public thinks that the statement in the note that Italy's memorandum to the League of Nations has not received appropriate research is contrary to the facts. In addition, the argument held by the Italian government that the Sanctions Adjustment Committee has no foothold is considered by people here to be that Italy does not understand the relationship between member states and the League of Nations. At the same time, people in Geneva think that the note that Italy sent to the member states of the League of Nations is the only way that it can still implement as a member state of the League of Nations. The public feels that the issue of Italy remaining in the League of Nations will be raised soon. When the Fascist Party holds a conference in Rome on November 16, it may propose this matter on its own initiative. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Those in charge are deeply worried that if the countries continue to implement sanctions against Italy, Italy may retaliate by withdrawing from the League of Nations.

Some people have already expressed that Italy may decide to withdraw from the League of Nations at that time. In addition, in the last paragraph of Italy's protest note to various countries, it stated that the Italian government is willing to take various measures to prevent the crisis caused by the current situation. Well-informed sources believe that France's reply to Italy will express approval of Italy's wishes. The general public believes that France's reply will be presented orally, the same as Italy's note, and the date will be set for November 18, the day when sanctions against Italy are implemented. In addition, the general well-informed sources do not believe that the Italian note is enough to cause the various countries participating in sanctions to change their fundamental positions.

<p>(Vienna) Foreign Minister Walter Neigg declared in the Federal Parliament today that Austria would cooperate with various countries to prohibit the transportation of war materials to Italy. Austria had previously stated in Geneva that it was unwilling to participate in sanctions against Italy. The Foreign Minister's statement today is quite surprising. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) According to official sources, Austria's attitude towards the sanctions issue is based on the provisions of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, which prohibits Austria from exporting arms to other countries and guarantees that goods from other countries can freely pass through Austria to Italy. In addition, Foreign Minister Weideger recently declared to the press that "Germany is not a member state of the League of Nations, so according to the Treaty of Saint-Germain, Austria cannot prohibit German goods from passing through the territory to Italy." According to a Havas reporter, although Austria and Britain have always had close friendships, Austria had to cancel its pro-active attitude toward sanctions for two reasons. First, Italy saved Austria from being annexed by Germany in 1934. As for the League of Nations, whether it can assist Austria is a question. Seeing that Italian troops have occupied Magale and Golahei, and sanctions against Italy have not yet been implemented, it can be seen that the League of Nations' assistance is slow and does not address the urgent need. Second, the trade between Italy and Austria is beneficial to Austria. Austria relies on the benefits obtained from trade with Italy to pay off foreign debts. Therefore, it cannot participate in sanctions to lose this kind of trade benefit. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>Abyssinian Plant Research: (Moscow, TASS, October 19) The great Soviet scientist Vavilov led a team to Abyssinia in 1927 to investigate local plants. They stayed in Abyssinia for four months, traveling two thousand kilometers and surveying all of the country's major agricultural areas. They collected more than six thousand types of local plants. Vavilov recently published his research results, first stating that Abyssinia is rich in plant species, which are unknown in other countries. Vavilov also stated that although Abyssinia is small and mountainous, the number of wheat species exceeds that of the entire world. As far as botanists know, there are a total of six hundred and fifty types of wheat, and the Abyssinian mountains have two hundred and fifty types. Vavilov continued, stating that Abyssinian plants are very suitable for the Soviet Union. Abyssinian barley is currently being cultivated in the Leningrad Province, Ghibiny beyond the Arctic Circle, and the Kola Peninsula, with good results. The Soviet Union is also using Abyssinian barley and legumes as superior species for hybridization. Abyssinia usually has short days and long nights, so Abyssinian plants can also be cultivated in the Soviet Union's far northern regions during the long days of summer. Among Abyssinian plants, teff grass is now a valuable forage crop in the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>

<p>(Moscow) It is reported that the natural increase in the Soviet population is very rapid, with an increase of 21 million people from 1927 to 1934. In the first half of this year, the natural population growth rate in Soviet industrial centers was 15 to 24 per thousand, while in Germany from 1933 to 1934 it was only 3.1 per thousand.

<p>— (Lectures to the national public on October 18, 21, 27, and 28) Researcher at the Institute of Astronomy, Academia Sinica</p>
<p>This classification is based on astronomy, categorized by month for statistical convenience. For instance, if we want the average temperature of spring, we simply calculate the average temperature of March, April, and May. This classification is commonly used in meteorology. As for which of the three classifications is better, there is no set standard; it depends on the climate of each region. From a theoretical perspective, our Chinese classification, the first one, can be said to be the most reasonable. It designates the astronomical time of warmth, the vernal equinox, as the center of spring, and the hottest time, the summer solstice, as the center of summer, which is very appropriate.</p>
<p>Now, we will discuss why the climate of a certain place on Earth has various changes throughout the year. We already know that the Earth's orbit is within the ecliptic plane, and it forms an angle of approximately twenty-three and a half degrees with the Earth's equator. The Earth's axis of rotation is perpendicular to its equator, forming a ninety-degree angle. Therefore, the angle between the Earth's axis of rotation and its orbital plane is also twenty-three and a half degrees, resulting in the Earth's poles having different relationships with the sun at different times. Around July 21st, the Earth's North Pole is tilted twenty-three and a half degrees towards the sun. At this time, the South Pole is in the hemisphere without sunlight, while the North Pole receives sunlight throughout the day. In the Northern Hemisphere, days are long and nights are short; in the Southern Hemisphere, days are short and nights are long. The situation is reversed at the winter solstice, when the South Pole can see the sun all day. During the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, around March 21st and September 23rd, the Earth's equatorial plane passes through the sun, so day and night are equally long everywhere on Earth. Places on the equator have equal day and night lengths throughout the year, so there are virtually no seasons.</p>
<p>The area within twenty-three and a half degrees north and south of the equator is called the tropics, where the sun is overhead throughout the year. The area between twenty-three and a half degrees and sixty-six and a half degrees north and south of the equator is called the temperate zone, where the sun does not pass through the zenith, and the sun is not below the horizon at noon, so the seasonal changes are most pronounced in the temperate zone. China is located within the temperate zone, so the seasonal climate changes are also very significant. The area from the temperate zone to the North and South Poles is called the frigid zone, where the sun is not visible in winter, and in summer, the sun does not set below the horizon but circles around it.</p>
<p>Why is summer hotter than winter in the temperate zone? Some say it's because the Earth is closer to the sun in summer and farther away in winter, but this is incorrect. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Earth is actually closer to the sun in winter than in summer. However, if the Earth is farther away from the sun in summer, why is it hotter than in winter? We know that seasonal climate changes are due to changes in atmospheric temperature, which vary according to the amount of solar heat received by the Earth's surface. The amount of solar heat received by a unit area on the Earth's surface depends on three main factors:</p>
<p>(1) The length of time the sun shines on the ground: the longer the sun shines on the ground, the more solar heat the ground receives.</p>
<p>(2) Whether the sunlight is direct or oblique: the higher the sun's altitude, the more heat the ground receives; the lower the sun's altitude, i.e., oblique sunlight, the less heat the ground receives.</p>
<p>(3) The amount of absorption by the atmosphere: the thicker the path that sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere, the more solar heat the atmosphere absorbs, and the less heat the ground receives.</p>
<p>Once we understand the above three relationships, we can understand why summer is hot and winter is cold. We already know that the days are longer in summer, and the sun is closer to the overhead point at noon, meaning the sun's altitude is higher than in winter. The sunlight shines directly on the ground, and it passes through a thinner layer of the atmosphere (the atmosphere is commonly known as air), so the atmosphere absorbs less solar heat, making the weather hot. In winter, the days are shorter, and the sun is farther from the overhead point at noon, meaning the sun's altitude is lower than in summer. The sunlight is oblique, and it passes through a thicker layer of the atmosphere, so the atmosphere absorbs more solar heat, making the weather cold.</p>
<p>Let's start from the vernal equinox, when day and night are equally long. After this, the days gradually become longer than the nights, and the sun's altitude also rises day by day, meaning the sun gradually changes from oblique to direct. Additionally, the layer of atmosphere (the atmosphere is commonly known as air) that sunlight passes through gradually thins, so the weather gradually becomes warmer. By the summer solstice, the days are longest, the sun's altitude is highest, and the sunlight passes through the thinnest layer of the atmosphere, making the weather the hottest. After the summer solstice, the days gradually shorten, and the sun's altitude gradually lowers. By the autumnal equinox, day and night are again equal, so the weather is the same as in spring. After the autumnal equinox, the days are shorter than the nights, and the sun's altitude is lower, so the layer of atmosphere through which sunlight passes gradually thickens, making the weather gradually colder. By the winter solstice, the days are shortest, the sun's altitude is lowest, and the sunlight passes through the thickest layer of the atmosphere, making the weather the coldest. After the winter solstice, the days gradually lengthen again, and the sun's altitude gradually rises, so the weather gradually warms up. This is the situation of seasonal change.</p>
<p>We have already stated above that the amount of solar heat received in the Northern Hemisphere is greatest at the summer solstice, which should be the hottest time. However, in reality, the summer solstice is not the hottest time; August is the hottest. Also, the amount of solar heat received at the winter solstice is the least, which should be the coldest time, but in reality, the winter solstice is not the coldest; February is the coldest. This phenomenon is called the seasonal lag, which is due to the influence of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>We know that the Earth is surrounded by the atmosphere. Because of the atmosphere, the Earth receives heat from the sun on the one hand, and radiates heat outwards from the surface on the other. We know that the temperature can only increase if the Earth receives more heat from the sun than it radiates from the surface. If the Earth receives less heat than it radiates, the temperature will decrease. Therefore, the summer solstice is the time of year when the Earth receives the most heat, and during this time, the heat received by the Earth's surface is greater than the heat radiated from the surface, so the temperature increases day by day. Thus, from the summer solstice until around August, the temperature continues to increase. When the temperature reaches its maximum, it stops increasing, which is when the amount of heat received is equal to the amount of heat lost. This is the hottest time of the year, so it is not at the summer solstice but around August. The same principle applies in winter, with the lowest temperature reached sometime between January and February. However, climate change is not determined solely by the conditions of one place; it also depends on the relationship with winds and ocean currents from other places. Therefore, the coldest or hottest time of a particular place cannot be determined solely by astronomical theory; it varies considerably from year to year. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Roosevelt Writes to the American Bankers Association: Very Pleased with Economic Recovery <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>New Orleans: President Roosevelt sent a letter to the American Bankers Association today, which was read by Jesse Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), at the association's annual meeting. The letter expressed the President's great pleasure with the consolidation of the position of American banks and the great progress in economic recovery in recent years. It stated that the extent of the recovery over the past two years could be seen from bank deposits and collateral, and hoped that all banks would make full use of the new banking laws to provide credit and loans to the business community, industry, and real estate in a stable manner. After Jones read the President's letter, he gave a speech criticizing the methods of interaction between American railroads and banks, stating that the public should give railroads fair access to capital, and that the banking industry's interactions with railroads should be subject to stricter regulations to limit interest rates and other expenses. He said that although the government should immediately stop lending to railroads, the current government loans have lighter interest and therefore the people should spare no effort to make the government not nationalize the railways. Jones briefly described the activities of the RFC, stating that most of the loans borrowed by banks and insurance companies have been repaid, and that the collateral for these loans was not acceptable to ordinary banks, so such rapid repayment was remarkable. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>New Orleans: Government officials delivered speeches today at the 64th annual meeting of the American Bankers Association, vaguely mentioning the government's plans to withdraw from the banking industry and private business sectors. After the meeting opened, banking leaders spoke first, requesting that the government not interfere in private business. RFC Director Jesse Jones responded, saying that he agreed with the members of the ABA and was eager for the government to withdraw from the lending business as soon as possible, but that such steps should not be taken too hastily. Jones also called for fair treatment of railroads, saying that too many of the country's railroads were controlled by banks, and that banks were making large profits from providing them with financial assistance. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Director Crowley stated that banks should make extra efforts to replace government loans with private loans. According to his observation, the reasons why the United States has not been able to have a more stable and efficient banking system in the past are nine: (1) too many undercapitalized banks, (2) inefficient management, (3) unstable operations, (4) excessive loan expansion, (5) excessive competition, (6) lax supervision, (7, 8, and 9) lack of understanding of the social economy and legislative trends related to the banking industry. The ways to remedy this are: (1) replace RFC funds with private funds, (2) effective management, (3) harmonious banking laws, (4) replace bank loans with private loans, (5) avoid the reasons for state government interference, and other major points. ABA President Hieber stated that the public now trusts banks again, saying that the emergency period is gradually passing, and that there are now various reasons why the government should begin to withdraw from the private business sector. Members of the association should strive to work for freedom in a serious and effective process for the development of private business and the creation of industry; otherwise, those who seek to grant greater power to the government and socialize various industries may prevail. The outlook for business is now optimistic, and the Banking Act of 1935 has become a perfect piece of legislation. The RFC Director read President Roosevelt's letter, hoping that bankers would raise commercial credit based on a solid foundation, and said that he was confident that through the cooperation of the banking sector, the business community, and the government, all current problems could soon be resolved. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Federal Reserve Bank today released a report on rediscount operations, stating that bank loans across the country have increased sharply to help the business community recover. In the week before November 6, member bank loans in 101 cities across the country increased by $1,000,000, mortgage loans increased by $27,000,000, totaling $3,233,000,000, commercial loans increased by $40,000,000, totaling $3,380,000, real estate loans decreased by $4,000,000, totaling $1,142,000,000, and private bonds held by member banks decreased by $82,000,000, totaling $3,084,000,000, but government bonds increased by $59,000,000, totaling $8,236,000,000. The total amount of loans and investments by the Reserve Bank increased by $48,000,000, totaling $20,426,000,000. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>(London) Baker, President of the Mexican Silver Mining Company, gave a speech at the company's annual shareholders' meeting today, vaguely stating that "Since China implemented its new monetary policy recently, the silver market situation has become increasingly gloomy. If the US government decides to continue its policy of purchasing silver to maintain the ratio of gold to silver held by the US government, I believe silver may still be able to maintain a price not far from the current market price." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Herald Tribune published an article today stating that China's abandonment of the silver standard and adoption of managed currency was caused by the US silver purchase policy. China has used the silver standard for a long time, so whether paper money can circulate is still a question, but China has indeed prepared to engage in this experiment, which shows that the US manipulation of silver is harmful to China.

<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval attended the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon and delivered a speech in defense of the substitute legal ordinances issued by the government to revitalize the economy and balance the budget. One passage concerned the protection of the franc, and his words were sincere and moving. He stated vaguely that any measures that would devalue the franc should be resolutely opposed, because devaluation would harm most people. Most members of the Finance Committee advocated slightly reducing government spending and increasing income tax and inheritance tax to restore budget balance. Former Finance Minister Reynaud, who was most active in advocating currency devaluation, also said that he would vote in favor of the budget proposed by the government. The committee then announced an adjournment and will meet again on Thursday. The Executive Committee of the Radical Socialist Party passed a motion today advocating that members of parliament belonging to the party should facilitate the government's work to balance the budget. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies met today to examine the naval budget for 1936, which totaled 3,429,000,000 francs, an increase of 526,000,000 francs over this year. The detailed allocation is as follows: (1) the number of naval personnel increased by 4,250, but the total amount of their expenses was reduced because of salary cuts based on the substitute legal ordinances issued by the government; (2) the cost of adding armaments and repairs increased compared to this year; (3) shipbuilding expenses increased from 1,283,000,000 francs this year to 1,547,000,000 francs; (4) naval aviation expenses also increased. According to the Finance Committee reporter, all countries' navies are expanding greatly, and according to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 18, once British naval power increases, German naval power can also be expanded at any time, so French naval policy should not remain passive forever.

<p>(Paris) At the opening of the trial of more than twenty alleged accomplices in the Stavisky fraud case today, including Stavisky's wife, when one of the defendants' lawyers, former member of parliament Mr. Garat, argued fiercely with Court President Barnaud, the Court President became visibly angry, shouted loudly, and repeatedly waved his arm. Mr. Garat responded with the same gesture, and his fellow lawyers tried to pull him down. When the Court President shouted at Mr. Garat, "Sit down, or you will force me to act unilaterally!" the spectators in the courtroom shouted their agreement, causing temporary chaos before order was restored. This case is one of the most astonishing and intense cases in modern French history, with a total of seventy lawyers appearing in court and as many as one hundred and twenty-one witnesses being summoned. It seems unlikely that it can be concluded in a short time. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>Organizing a New Company, Taiwan as the Central Hub of Operations</p>
<p>Taipei – Japan has resolved to use Taiwan as the central hub of operations for its advance into South China. It will first engage in independent economic activities, proposing six major projects: (1) revitalization of trade; (2) revitalization of industry; (3) subsidies for enterprises and investments; (4) improvement of finance; (5) development of transportation; (6) establishment of cultural enterprises. These will be promoted in South China as a unified plan. During the previous conference of Japanese military attachés stationed in China in Shanghai, discussions were held on whether to organize a new company for the development of South China, or to have the existing Xingzhong (Revive China) Company handle it concurrently. The conclusion was that a new company should be established for the development of South China. However, if difficulties arise and a new company cannot be organized, it would have no choice but to combine with the Xingzhong Company to shoulder the important task of development. But at the very least, it must be recognized that the advance into South China still possesses independent economic activity, and so forth. Therefore, a new company is currently being organized, and efforts are underway to cooperate and coordinate with the development of Southeast Asia, and to seek strong diplomatic harmony for practical advancement.

<h3 id="e36">A Review of the Philippine Independence Movement (Part 1) <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Hanfang</p>
<p>The Philippine Commonwealth government will be established tomorrow. We cannot help but pay great attention to this brand-new independent nation in Asia, because its economy, politics, and culture are all closely related to ours. Now, let us first recount the entire course of its independence movement:</p>
<p>(1) The Beginning of the Independence Movement – After the cessation of armed resistance against the United States, the Filipinos began a peaceful independence movement. However, this movement was previously unorganized. The first political party in the Philippines, the Unionist Party, advocated the permanent merger of the Philippines with the United States, but it had few supporters. Later, the party advocated independence after a period of preparation. At the same time, the Nationalist Party had been established, and they fully advocated independence. In the first election of the Philippine Assembly in 1907, Nationalist Party members held the majority, so the party organized a delegation to strongly advocate for the issue of independence.</p>
<p>For the sake of the independence issue, with the unanimous support of the Philippine Assembly and the support of the former Philippine Governor Taft (former US President), two resident commissioners were selected and sent to Washington. The second commissioner, the current first President of the Commonwealth government, Quezon, was also among them. He served as commissioner from 1909 to 1916, continuously expressing the desire for independence to the US Congress and the American people.</p>
<p>(2) The Policy Adopted by the United States Toward the Philippines – The opinions of general politicians regarding the policy adopted by the United States toward the Philippines were almost the same. That is, the US government would first be in a guiding position, gradually increase their autonomy, and ultimately let them be independent, but it was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>US President McKinley issued an instruction to the Philippine Commission on January 20, 1899, stating his desire that the Philippines would receive the most favorable treatment, incomparable to conquered nations, because the Philippines was not seized from the Filipinos by direct force. We must seek the progress of their culture and education, and the development of their self-governing ability. This responsibility cannot be abandoned.</p>
<p>When President Taft was governor in the Philippines, on December 17, 1903, he said, "American newspapers circulating in the Philippines have consistently advocated the expansion of Filipino administrative power, which means that the Philippines is for the Filipinos." The United States' implementation of various policies in the Philippines is also intended to ensure the phrase "the Philippines is for the Filipinos." For its benefit, evolution, civilization... or independence. The only question now is, what is the best way to bring happiness to the Filipinos? Also, in April 1904, when Taft was Secretary of War, he spoke of the Philippines: "When the Filipinos learn self-government, and gradually increase their experience, we can discuss how to resolve the issue of independence. Or, maintain the status quo, still under the protection of their beloved, selfless, guiding leader, the United States."</p>
<p>In 1908, after the Philippine Assembly was opened, US Governor Roosevelt wrote a letter to the Assembly, saying, "I believe the time for Filipinos to make their own decisions is coming. Do they want to be independent? Or is it better to be under the protection of a strong, selfless force, which can maintain domestic order on the one hand, and prevent foreign invasion on the other?"</p>
<p>President Wilson sent a letter on October 6, 1913, which was forwarded to the Filipinos by Manila Governor Harrison, saying, "We are protectors, not for the benefit of the American people, but for the benefit of the Filipinos. The steps we take are ultimately to give them independence. And prepare them for how they can be independent." On December 2, 1913, he gave another letter to the US Congress, saying, "Their own plans and experiences are naturally better than ours. We must study how to serve them, and think about how to quickly relinquish the responsibility of guardianship."</p>
<p>(3) The Jones Law – The passage of the Jones Law was truly a noteworthy event. Its various plans were all designed for the Philippines to prepare for independence. He introduced this view to both houses of the United States Congress, but it was rejected. However, after final discussion, the Jones Law was passed.</p>
<p>The Jones Law is a resolution declaring the opinion of the American people on the future politics of the Philippines. Its main idea is included in the following narrative.</p>
<p>"Since the American people had no ambition for conquest and expansion of land in the war between the United States and Spain, and the purpose of the American people is always to withdraw their rule in the Philippines, recognize the independence of the Philippine Islands, and allow them to quickly build an autonomous government. Because it is hoped that this purpose will be quickly realized, many political powers are returned to their hands, allowing them to practice themselves, and they will naturally know where responsibility lies, and can complete political independence as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The Jones Law seems like a guarantee given by the American people to the Chinese people. Because what the successive presidents of the United States have stated is only an administrative opinion, which cannot actually bind the United States. In addition, the policy of the US government regarding the ultimate goal of the Philippines is to further expand the power of Filipinos to manage the Philippines. What the Jones Law contributed to the Filipinos was more clear in attitude and more concrete in organization.</p>
<p>The American Provincial Assembly, local public organizations, and various groups all agreed with the Jones Law, and successively passed the Jones Law bill, sincerely willing to be the guarantee of the Jones Law.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the Filipinos, the Jones Law seems like a contract between the American and Filipino people. From the first time they will build an autonomous government, or all the power is in the hands of the Filipinos. Second, American sovereignty cannot be reduced for a while. Third, when the autonomous government is successfully built, prepare to give them complete independence.</p>
<p>(4) The Temporary Suspension of the Independence Movement During the Great War – Not long after the Jones Law was passed, the United States participated in the European Great War. The Filipinos believed that they should not bother the United States at this time, and the argument for the independence movement was temporarily declared terminated.</p>
<p>The Filipinos, according to the orders of the US government, drew out 35,000 people to serve in the European War, and also supplied the United States with several submarines and torpedo destroyers. There were also six thousand sound-minded troops who enlisted in the United States Navy, which can be said to be the Filipinos' slight contribution to the Americans in times of trouble. But the help of the Americans to the Philippine Islands, even in terms of finance alone, can be said to be quite a lot. Americans give 500,000 yuan a year to fund the Philippine Red Cross. Every time the Filipinos raise public bonds, the Americans enthusiastically donate, and the total amount has reached 70 million gold yuan. The Filipinos have achieved a hundred political successes in a short period of time, naturally relying on the help of the United States.</p>
<p>(5) The Revival of the Independence Theory After the War – After the end of the European War, the issue of independence began to be discussed again. On November 7, 1918, the Senate passed a bill to add a committee for the matter of independence. The Independence Committee plans everything to achieve complete separation from the United States. The Senate will adopt any proposals and reports from the Committee as much as possible. The Committee also sent members to the United States to make earnest requests to the United States with gratitude and respect, believing that the Filipinos had done what they should do, and to listen with sympathy, but there was actually no action.</p>
<p>On March 17, 1919, the Philippine Assembly passed the "Declaration of Purpose." This declaration formally describes the status, determination, and importance of the independence issue of the Filipinos. The general idea is that the time has come for us to make a firm decision to discuss the issue of independence. It also repeatedly affirms the expansion of their autonomous powers by the Americans and various generous policies. The Filipinos have always believed and have not changed in the slightest. It also mentions that the Jones Law is a reliable contract. The current state of the Philippine Commonwealth government is very satisfactory to the United States and other countries. The Filipinos have fulfilled what the Americans had hoped for the Filipinos to do in the past, and now the Filipinos are only waiting for the Americans to fulfill their contract.</p>
<p>The representative of the US government in the Philippine Islands has the responsibility to supervise the Filipinos in building the government under the Jones Law. Governor Harrison and the Philippine Senate made a report to the US Congress saying: "I want to state my responsibility as governor, and my opinion is that Filipino self-governing politics is very necessary at present. Presidents Cleveland and McKinley also advocated this. And we know that Mr. Rhodes was elected as the executive by the help of the people, and can maintain order internally and bear international responsibilities externally."</p>

From the 5th, the prices of all goods in the city suddenly rose, and the price of copper coins used for change soared from 530 coins per yuan to 500 coins, 480 coins, and at the peak, reached 370 coins. The market price changed several times a day, and commodity prices also increased accordingly. Social rumors spread, and the livelihood of the poor was greatly affected. The tram company operated by a Belgian merchant, which is the main exchange center for copper coins in the city, posts exchange rates every morning. Various exchange businesses also rely on it as a place to operate. However, due to the price increase, they considered it profitable to hoard and monopolize, and arbitrarily set market prices. The number of coins exchanged daily also decreased. On the 9th and 10th, they posted notices in the trams, asking passengers to purchase tickets with silver yuan instead of copper coins, stating that the company would not be responsible for any copper coin market conditions. As a result, disputes frequently arose between passengers and conductors. The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice on November 6th, prohibiting manipulation and monopolies, and prohibiting raising the market prices of rice and flour, but the result was unsuccessful. On November 9th, it convened another meeting of money and grain businesses, ordering them to effectively stabilize prices. Rice and flour must return to the market prices of five days prior. Copper coins were fixed at 500 coins per legal tender yuan. Tram companies were allowed to exchange at 503 coins per yuan, and exchange businesses were allowed to profit three coins after exchanging. At the same time, another strict notice was issued, but on the 10th, due to the official legal price being too high and the difference in the amount received by the shops being too large, they all refused to exchange. Even when purchasing retail goods, if copper coins were needed for change, the shops would rather cancel the transaction than exchange them at the official rate. On the same day, because the tram company had a regular holiday, copper coins were not exchanged to the outside, causing a shortage of cash on the market and making it difficult to turn over. Until the evening, the Municipal Government approved a joint request from the eight district construction offices and issued a strict notice prohibiting hoarding and manipulation, otherwise, they would be punished according to the law. The Public Security Bureau arrested two groups of profiteers hoarding copper coins that evening, and the market price began to stabilize slightly. Until the 11th, the rice and flour businesses followed the official order and effectively suppressed prices. The outflow of copper coins decreased, and the market situation began to stabilize. As for the reason for the rise in copper coin prices, it was mostly due to rampant rumors. Farmers in the surrounding areas did not understand the true nature of legal tender and hoarded copper coins, resulting in an unusual shortage in the city and leading to a surge in prices.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of shipping silver south from Tianjin, the banking community has held meetings for several days to discuss the matter. If the silver is shipped to the central government, there will be a shortage of cash in the local area, and the money supply will be disrupted. Foreigners will take advantage of this, and the copper coin price increase may still be difficult to avoid. Therefore, Li Da, Governor of the Central Bank, Lu Baimei, Governor of the Bank of China, Zhong Binglu, Manager of the Bank of Communications, Ji Hua, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Xiaoyan, Chairman of the Money Shop Association, jointly telegraphed to Beijing, requesting that the central government allow them not to ship the silver south and to establish a Tianjin Reserve Custody Committee branch, with Bian Baimei, Governor of the Bank of China in Tianjin, Liu Yushu, Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, Liu Jicheng, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Yang Baoling, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, and Ji Hua, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, as members responsible for custody. The telegram has been sent, but a reply has not yet been received. (11th)</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Investigating Profiteers Buying Hard Currency</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance implemented the new currency policy, commodity prices in Suzhou rose sharply at the beginning of implementation, but have recently returned to their original state. Even the price of cigarettes is gradually returning to normal. However, recently, some Zhenjiang cigarette shops in the city have sent staff to urban and rural areas to buy hard currency from shops and residents, offering a premium of 40-50 cash per yuan. It is reported that the hard currency will be secretly transported to Shanghai and sold to a certain place, where a profit of about 20 cents per yuan can be made. The Public Security Bureau has also heard about this and is investigating closely.</p>
<p>Waifeng Money Shop Suddenly Grounded</p>
<p>Jiufeng Money Shop on Guanqian Street, which has been in business for ten years, is considered reputable in the Suzhou money industry. Its deposits and loans each amount to more than 600,000 yuan. On the 12th, there was a sudden run on the bank. The money shop was unprepared and unable to cope, resulting in a standstill. That night, the Money Shop Association convened an emergency meeting to discuss remedies, deciding that the money shop should entrust the Money Shop Association to mortgage some of its fixed assets for cash to maintain operations. Depositors will be paid 30% first, and the remaining payments will be made after the loans are recovered. It is currently open for business and collecting accounts.</p>

<p>High Court President Inspects Prison</p>
<p>Zhu Shusheng, President of the Jiangsu High Court, came to Yangzhou for inspection. On the morning of the 10th, accompanied by Luo, President of the Jiangdu District Court, and others, he went to the prison to inspect. The prison warden, Hu Song, presented a register of prisoners. After Zhu glanced through it, he went to inspect the prison. According to the prisoners' request for food relief, Hu, the prison warden, reported that he had been ordered to process prison rehabilitation. It was estimated that 55 prisoners were eligible for parole and had been registered and submitted to the county prison association for review. Only 15 names were approved. Applications for parole for crimes involving robbery, murder, and kidnapping were generally not approved. President Zhu was informed of the situation and immediately summoned Magistrate Ma. However, Ma was in the provincial capital on official business, so Secretary Wang Zhizhi represented him. President Zhu informed him that the government's parole procedures were part of the prison rehabilitation regulations and were not strict. Regardless of the crime, as long as the prisoner showed remorse, he could be paroled according to the law. He instructed him to relay this to Magistrate Ma for handling. It is reported that Zhu crossed south that afternoon after inspecting the prison.</p>

The informant reported the incident to the district headquarters, and six suspects were arrested in Jiaxing and sent to the county government for interrogation. On the 12th, the trial judge, Du Shimin, took his seat in the criminal court and brought in the arrested suspects, Liu Shiyuan, Wang Wenyi, Liu Yuqin, Bi Mengqin, Ge Yufu, and Sun Baosheng, and summoned the tax police officer Zhang Yinsong who had made the arrests to testify. As a result, Ge and Sun were found to have no major suspicion and were allowed to be released on bail. The others were returned to custody pending sentencing on the 16th.</p>

<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Progress on the Old Jiang Bridge Project</p>
<p>Since the Old Jiang Bridge in this port was contracted to Shanghai Kangyi Foreign Firm last year to rebuild a steel-concrete bridge, it has been almost a year. The foreign firm previously sent engineer Sike to Ningbo to supervise the workers and expedite the work. The bridge abutment and other projects have been completed one after another, which is quite trustworthy. According to engineer Sike, since the installation of steel bridge beams began last month using a crane, the weather has been clear and the work has been smooth. He is currently speeding up the work and has already begun pouring the cement bridge deck. Recently, if it does not rain or snow and the weather is not too cold, the entire project is expected to be completed on schedule by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Mingguang</p>
<p>Storage Consolidation Deadline Set</p>
<p>The case of storage consolidation in various counties of Anhui Province was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of November. However, current reports show that only five counties are actively progressing, 31 counties are preparing but have not yet made progress, and 25 counties have not yet reported. The provincial government believes that there are few days left until the deadline and cannot tolerate any delays. It has sent another telegram urging them to complete the work on time, otherwise, they will be severely punished. After receiving the telegram, the county government instructed the county storage management committee to comply and expedite the work.</p>

<p>— Ji Yuan</p>
<p>Various Aspects of Chongqing (Part 2)</p>
<p>4. Military Villas Scattered Throughout Sichuan In the past, the extortion and plundering by most military personnel in Sichuan Province had almost become a well-known fact throughout the country. One day, this reporter happened to be chatting with someone from Chongqing and learned that there was a so-called "military residence area" outside Tongyuan Gate in Chongqing City. It is normal for military personnel to have residences, but for residences to have an area, and for the so-called residences to have gardens, Western-style houses, pavilions, ball fields, and even zoos, is unique to Chongqing. This reporter, piqued by curiosity, took a car outside Tongyuan Gate to see the situation in the military residence area.</p>
<p>After leaving Tongyuan Gate, looking up from a distance, the uneven Eastern-style Western buildings were clearly visible. The structure of the houses was exquisite and elegant, relying on the mountains and water, surrounded by trees, like a paradise. This reporter, through the introduction of a friend, visited the residence of a certain division commander and saw that all the luxurious equipment in the residence, such as golf courses, indoor tennis courts, exquisite gardens, and cars, were all available. The front pavilion and rear pavilion were arranged exquisitely, and the fragrance of birds and flowers was refreshing. Later, chatting with the tea server in the residence, it was said, "The owner currently has seven wives, and one or two have already separated. In this area, the division commander with the most wives is so-and-so, with more than a dozen. He also has the most money. The owner is always eager to help others, so he not only has no savings but is also heavily in debt." It was also said that "there are no less than a hundred residences in this area, mostly occupied by military personnel above the rank of brigade commander. There are also quite a few who used to be high officials and are now living in leisure." After hearing this, this reporter could not help but be surprised.</p>
<p>After visiting the residence of a certain division commander, I went to visit Chiyuan Garden. It is said that this garden was also a military residence, but now it is rented to a businessman for business. The layout is quite similar to Shanghai's Bansong Garden, but it has hotels and restaurants, dense forests, and a quiet environment, making it a place for wealthy merchants to stay. Many military and political dignitaries hold banquets here.</p>
<p>5. Lifestyle Characteristics: Drinking Tea and Raising Birds The citizens of Chongqing, except for the general coolies, are mostly people of the leisure class. They are content with traditional lifestyles and mostly use tea houses as the only way to pass the time. There are particularly many small tea houses in Chongqing, and the prices are also very cheap. One copper coin can allow you to sit in a tea house for three or four hours, either whispering and gossiping, or shouting loudly and reporting news, or playing chess for recreation, or mediating disputes between others. It is said that in many tea houses in Chongqing, there are members of the Gelaohui organization lurking among them. Sichuanese call Gelaohui "running brother" and call the old man "master." The seniority is the highest, followed by "big brother," "second brother," etc. The discipline in the association is very strict, and there is an obligation to absolutely obey the master. The master has the power of life and death over his subordinates. The Gelaohui ranks are divided into four types: "benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom." Benevolence is the highest, righteousness is the second, propriety is the next, and wisdom is the lower-level organization. It was extremely prosperous during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and its residual power still exists. Many people in rural areas join. If outsiders visit Sichuan Province and can interact with or seek protection from a reasonably reputable member of the Gelaohui, they can be safe wherever they go, otherwise, unfortunate accidents are likely to occur. Recently, I heard that the provincial government has a proposal to restrict the establishment of tea houses.</p>
<p>Raising birds is also one of the lifestyle habits of idle people in Chongqing. They get up early in the morning with nothing to do, so they carry a birdcage and stroll the streets, or wander around parks and forests, sitting sideways and listening to the chirping of birds. This reporter went to Central Park in the morning and, before entering the park gate, heard the sound of birds and the sound of people harmonizing with each other. Even the people of a prosperous age could not surpass this.</p>
<p>6. The Market for Intellectual Laborers In Chongqing, general coolies must go through intermediaries before they can sell their labor or obtain their labor tools, as described above. In addition to this, intellectual laborers also have a place to find work. According to my friend Jiang Jun, in front of Chongqing Central Park, there is a tea house called "Yule," which is a place for middle and primary schools to recruit teachers. If the principal wants to hire a teacher for a certain subject but cannot find one, he can sit idly in the "Yule" tea garden or ask someone to contact the "Yule" tea garden. Unemployed teachers who want to find a suitable job can also go to "Yule" to inquire about news. This kind of organization is quite similar to a job referral agency, but there is no publicly responsible person. It is said that there are quite a few unemployed middle and primary school teachers in Chongqing recently. Wang, the manager of the Chongqing Kaiming Bookstore, told this reporter, "The education situation in Chongqing and nearby counties is very difficult. Schools at all levels have unpaid salaries for more than a year. Ba County once had more than 60 primary schools, but this year it has been reduced to 20. In the past, there was Dongli Middle School in Dongli and Nanli Middle School in Nanli, but now they have been completely cancelled. The source of education funding in Ba County is "Hongzhuang" (the tax levied on the sale of land), meat tax surcharges, fruit donations, and white charcoal donations. The income is not much. Currently, in Ba County alone, there are more than 200 unemployed teachers."</p>
<p>7. Chongqing Municipal Construction Plan On the morning of October 5th, this reporter went to the municipal government to visit Mayor Zhang Biguo. Secretary Zhou Huili received me on his behalf and told me in great detail about the Chongqing municipal construction plan, saying that the current central plan of the municipal government is (1) to control commerce, (2) to guide investment, and (3) to improve production technology, so that annual income continues to increase (before 1932, Chongqing's bristle export income reached 3 million yuan per year, but now it is only 900,000 yuan), (4) The four ministries have established an agricultural guidance center to regulate supply and demand and manage factories to improve the lives of workers, (7) Establish a municipal bank to absorb small capital and provide relief to small merchants, (8) Establish a job referral agency, a small loan office, and a public pawnshop, (9) Establish low-cost restaurants and build low-cost hostels in Chaotianmen, Tongyuanmen, Taipingmen, and other places, (10) Establish a relief home to provide relief to the disabled, elderly, weak, young, infants, and orphans (the current Chongqing relief home can only accommodate 150 people). The above plans are all necessary measures for Chongqing municipal construction and I hope that they can be gradually implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Foreign Exchange Bankers Association Meeting: Silver Deposits Exchanged for Legal Tender <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>

Simultaneously, all banks, money shops, factories, companies, and businesses are complying by exchanging their silver reserves for legal tender at the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. Furthermore, the preparatory management committee for issuance is investigating the reserve funds of each issuing bank, and the cash reserves of each bank have been sent to designated warehouses to be stored as issuance reserves. It is reported that preparatory management committees for issuance will be established in various locations.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Association Convenes Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Exchange Bankers Association held a meeting at 5:00 PM the afternoon before yesterday at the Mercantile Bank on the Bund. Representatives from twenty banks attended, including Mercantile Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, Banque de l'Indochine, Citibank, Hua Bi Bank, Netherlands Trading Society, Bank of Taiwan, Sumitomo Bank, Mitsui Bank, Bank of Chosen, Mitsubishi Bank, Chase Bank, American Express Bank, British Bank, Hua Yi Bank, Wells Fargo, Banque Franco-Chinoise, and Deutsch-Asiatische Bank. The manager of Mercantile Bank presided over the meeting and reported on the letter received from the Central Bank requesting that all banks hand over their silver reserves to be exchanged for legal tender at the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. A lengthy discussion ensued, and the meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>British Banks and Others Agree to Hand Over Silver Reserves</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from foreign banks that the silver reserves held by various foreign banks in Shanghai, such as Mercantile Bank, HSBC, Citibank, and Yokohama Specie Bank, amounted to 22,220,000 taels and 78,160,000 yuan as of the end of last week. It is reported that British banks such as Mercantile Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, and British Bank have all agreed to hand over their silver reserves to be exchanged for legal tender at the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. It is also reported that American banks such as Citibank, Wells Fargo, Chase Bank, as well as Hua Bi Bank, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, and Hua Yi Bank have also agreed to comply.</p>
<p>Cash Storage Committees Established in Various Ports</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance announced the currency decree, all silver reserves nationwide must be concentrated in the three banks to serve as reserve funds for the issuance of legal tender. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance, for the convenience of various locations, has decided to establish cash storage committees in major ports across the country. Committee members will be selected from local financial industry leaders and representatives from various sectors. The committee will be subordinate to the preparatory management committee for issuance. In Beiping, the chairman of the Beiping Bankers Association, Zhou Zuomin, will serve on the committee. The implementation in other ports will follow. It is also learned that Zhou Zuomin went to Nanjing on the 12th to meet with Finance Minister Kong to seek instructions. Wu Daquan, the head of the Chinese economic delegation to Japan, has also returned to Tianjin and is currently in Beijing. He is scheduled to visit Shanghai in the coming days.</p>
<p>Joint Industrial Associations Telegraph Support for Legal Tender</p>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday to express support for legal tender and requested the prompt promulgation of real estate mortgage regulations. The original telegram reads: "To Finance Minister Kong Jun in Nanjing: China's economy has been collapsing in recent years, and agriculture, industry, and commerce are all on the verge of collapse. Your department has taken control, promulgated emergency decrees, nationalized silver, and designated banknotes from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications as legal tender to prevent the outflow of silver, regulate international exchange rates, establish the country on a foundation of stability, and create a prosperous environment for the market. These are excellent plans that have been praised both domestically and internationally. It is not just our association that sings praises. However, our association is a group of domestic goods industries, and we speak from an industrial perspective. Your department's prudent, thorough, and resolute reforms have already silenced those who spread rumors, but follow-up measures should be implemented as soon as possible. Recently, gold prices have soared, increasing the cost of industrial raw materials imported from abroad. Various prices have also increased directly or indirectly. At a time when people's purchasing power is weak, even if goods are cheap, people cannot afford to buy them. In addition, real estate is sluggish, and funds circulating in the market are decreasing daily. If prices rise while people's purchasing power is weak, the market will not recover. The major plans announced by your department, such as establishing a central reserve bank, increasing the number of real estate mortgage lending banks, promulgating real estate mortgage regulations, and reforming the organization of foreign banks, should be implemented as soon as possible to promote economic recovery and consolidate industry and commerce. Your department has high ambitions and long-term plans, and you have your own strategies, so there is no need for our association to worry excessively. However, even rivers and seas do not reject small streams, so we dare to offer our humble suggestions. We ask for your consideration."</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Rates Remain Stable for Several Days</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee announced yesterday morning at 10:00 AM that the stabilization tax rate would remain at 57.25%. The Central Bank announced the following foreign exchange rates: London, 1 shilling 2.5 pence; New York, 29.75 yuan; Paris, 450 francs; Berlin, 73.5 marks; Japan, 103 yuan; Hong Kong, 87 yuan.

<h3 id="e83">The Signing of the Sino-French Air Transport Agreement <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Can Be Implemented in Three Months</p>
<p>The Sino-French air transport issue, which has been under discussion for six or seven years, has now been resolved. It has been learned that the Ministry of Transport of the National Government of the Republic of China and the French Ministry of Aviation officially signed the Sino-French air transport agreement a few days ago. The details of the process are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>The motive for Sino-French air transport began in 1929 when France was planning an airline from Marseille to Saigon, Vietnam. Under the name of the Eastern Aviation Company, they discussed Sino-French air transport with the Chinese transport authorities to facilitate air transport between the two countries. At that time, some technical issues needed to be confirmed, and a solution could not be reached for a while. Later, the French Far East airline was officially launched, and the need for air transport between China and France and Europe became increasingly apparent. After several rounds of negotiations, the French Minister of Aviation appointed a representative to discuss the matter in earnest. Both sides showed a spirit of cooperation and openness and agreed on a draft. After being approved by the responsible officials, representatives from both sides signed the Sino-French air transport agreement in Nanjing a few days ago.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Agreement</p>
<p>(A) A regular route will be established from Guangzhou via Guangzhou Bay to Hanoi, French Indochina. It will be operated by an airline wholly owned by the Ministry of Transport of the National Government of the Republic of China to carry passengers, goods, and mail back and forth. It will connect with the route of the French airline in Hanoi, French Indochina. (B) The route should be launched within three months after the signing of the agreement. The validity period of the agreement is three years.</p>
<p>Preparation Status</p>
<p>After the agreement was signed, the Ministry of Transport entrusted China National Aviation Corporation to send a plane to test the route from Guangzhou via Guangzhou Bay to Hanoi. At the same time, it prepared a number of pilots to provide service. It is expected that Sino-French air transport will be realized within three months. From then on, air transport between China and France can be linked, which will also enhance the relationship between the two countries.</p>

Wang Shize has been appointed as Consul in Hanoi, Hu Qingyu as Vice-Consul, and Shen Guanxi as Consul-General in Saigon. After receiving the order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Xu left Russia and returned to China. He came to Shanghai last week to consult with the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding exit procedures. It is now learned that Mr. Xu's exit procedures have been completed. After meeting with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions, he will go to Vietnam to open the consulate on a scheduled date.</p>

<h3 id="e87">General Labor Union Relieves Unemployed Workers <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Goods Sales Team Actively Proceeding</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union believes that Shanghai's industry and commerce are declining, and the number of unemployed workers is increasing daily. As the severe winter is approaching, the fear of life is very pitiful. In addition to submitting a report to the Fifth National Congress requesting that appropriate relief measures be planned, it also organizes a domestic goods sales team for unemployed workers as a temporary relief measure. Since its establishment, the team has been actively carrying out its work, sending people to various domestic goods factories to discuss sales and writing to the Joint Industrial Associations to ask them to collect products for them so that they can promote domestic goods while providing relief to the unemployed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to the Joint Industrial Associations</p>
<p>The association wrote to the Federation of Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories yesterday, saying: "We are writing to inform you that our association, in view of the increasingly serious unemployment problem and the sluggish sales of domestic goods, has established the Shanghai General Labor Union's Domestic Goods Sales Team to employ unemployed workers as team members, undertake the products of various domestic goods factories, distribute them to team members, and sell them inside and outside the city to use the profits to relieve the lives of team members, and to promote domestic goods while providing relief to the unemployed. We have long admired your association's responsibility for leading and supporting various domestic goods factories in Shanghai, and it is the hub for revitalizing national industry. We hope that you will not fail to support our association's modest intentions to relieve unemployment and promote domestic goods, even though the sales force is too small. We are sending you a letter and a copy of the organization rules of the Domestic Goods Sales Team. We would like to ask you to introduce several manufacturers to the team to sell the goods specified by the team, so that both parties can benefit. We hereby inform you in advance and hope for your consideration."</p>
<p>Sending People to Discuss</p>
<p>The association, together with Lu Yinchu and Su Shaotao, the directors of the sales team, sent people to various domestic goods factories to discuss the purchase of goods so that they could be handed over to unemployed workers to sell on their behalf to help them maintain their livelihood. It is reported that those who have completed negotiations include Qiming Cloth Factory, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, Mingxing Toothbrush Factory, Guang Sheng Hang, China Enamel Factory, Jiu Xing Enamel Factory, Hongxing Cloth Factory, Dongya Woolen Factory, and Great China Welfare Rubber Factory. It is reported that negotiations with other factories are continuing.</p>
<h3 id="e88">More Than 100 Trade Associations, Including the Sugar Industry, Request the Abolition of the Bran Tax in Guangdong Province <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, They Jointly Telegraphed to the Fifth National Congress</p>
<p>The Guangdong province's imposition of an additional tax on bran has aroused strong opposition from oil cake manufacturers in various places. In addition to sending representatives to Beijing to petition the Fifth National Congress, more than 100 trade associations in Shanghai, including the sugar industry, have risen up to support them. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed to the Fifth National Congress requesting its cancellation. The original telegram reads: "To the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang in Nanjing: We have investigated the case of Guangdong province's collection of additional fees on bran, which has caused work stoppages and transportation stoppages among oil cake merchants in various places. Producers, sellers, transporters, and related groups have repeatedly called for its cancellation for more than two months, but it has not been resolved. The harm to the people's livelihood has already been seen in the industry's documents and telegrams, and will not be repeated here. From the perspective of national laws and regulations, since the abolition of likin, except for the import, transit, and export taxes and surtaxes collected by the customs at the time of cargo transportation, and the consolidated tax collected at the time of cargo leaving the factory, there should be no more taxation of goods within the same territory. No matter what the name is, whether it is a tax or a fee, it is prohibited according to the order to abolish likin. Therefore, Article 62 of the Provisional Constitution during the Tutelage Period clearly prohibits disguised likin. The resolution of the National Finance Conference in 1934 regarding the reorganization of local finances listed nine items of unreasonable taxes and fees that should be abolished, including the sixth, which is unfair taxation of the import of goods from other places for the benefit of one place, and the seventh, which is taxes and fees levied on the production or sale of goods. All of these should be abolished by the end of 1934. Those that have not been levied shall not be opened without authorization by any means or in any name. These are all clearly verifiable. From this, it can be seen that Guangdong province's collection of additional fees on bran, no matter what reason it holds or what purpose it serves, is inappropriate in terms of the Provisional Constitution and the political order. It is heard that Guangdong province is vigorously implementing a three-year plan to abolish unreasonable taxes and fees. Now, if what it does is no different from likin and even more no different from unreasonable taxes and fees, it is even more incomprehensible. The reason why likin was abolished and unreasonable taxes and fees were abolished was originally to prevent the development of our country's industry, so we removed the obstacles in order to promote its revitalization. Unexpectedly, Guangdong province has dealt such a heavy blow to the emerging oil cake industry along the Yangtze River. All those who operate domestic industries will be disheartened by this. Our associations deeply sympathize with the suffering of oil cake manufacturers in various places who are unable to bear this harsh tax. We also feel that it is necessary to correct the evil precedent of Guangdong province violating the Provisional Constitution and political order and imposing this unjust tax. We dare not presume to be presumptuous and jointly telegraph to your conference for review, rapid rectification of the Provisional Constitution, and adoption of public opinion. It would be virtuous and convenient for Guangdong province to abolish the additional fees on bran immediately. Sugar industry, silk industry, cotton cloth industry, paper industry, wood industry, machine dyeing and weaving industry, woolen industry, Western medicine industry, and more than 100 other trade associations in Shanghai."</p>

<p>Injuries Not Serious</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, this morning (the 13th), an empty shell of a ceremonial gun suddenly exploded on the British cruiser HMS Dorsetshire in the Huangpu River. It is reported that at least two people were injured, one in the ear and the other in the arm, but neither was serious. It is reported that the British Navy authorities will notify the Chinese authorities to avoid outside rumors that it was a deliberate cannon firing. When this was investigated with the British Navy authorities at noon today, no information could be obtained. However, the British authorities will definitely issue a statement soon. The incident occurred at around 11:00 AM in the morning. The details cannot be ascertained, but it is likely that the British sailors caused the accident while wiping the gun.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Fish Market Organization Moves Towards Commercialization <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Limited Number of Positions, Strive for Thrift During Opening, Adopt an Employment System and Increase Worker Welfare</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the preparation of the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry has been reported in previous newspapers. When a reporter met with a certain gentleman from the preparatory committee yesterday and asked about the actual situation of the association, he was assured that the people of the preparatory committee regard this pioneering business as a reform of the fisheries economic system. In addition to finding ways to benefit fishermen, they also drew lessons from the bureaucratization of state-owned enterprises in the past, which often resulted in large organizations, wasted public funds, and various other mistakes. Therefore, the organization of the market this time is striving towards commercialization. The provisional articles of association for the fish market organization have been approved and promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and the Executive Yuan. In addition to the board of directors and supervisors, it is stipulated that there will be three sections, with a total of only 20 staff members. The Ministry of Industry also ordered that thrift be practiced during the opening and that the fixed number of personnel should not be fully employed. The monthly expenses are only set at 3,000 yuan, which will be filled by the preparatory personnel. There will be no additions until the business develops in the future, and then expansion will be carried out. As for the dock workers, the Ministry of Industry has formulated an outline of the management rules for loading and unloading workers of directly-administered state-owned enterprises, and the ministry will send personnel to be in charge of these affairs to thoroughly break the contracting system and increase worker welfare.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Safety Bureau, in order to allow opium addicts who did not register during the forced registration period to surrender themselves quickly during the voluntary registration period, has specifically launched the first opium addict crackdown starting on the (11th). It still urges opium addicts to register; those who violate will be fined and arrested. It is understood that the bureau dispatched investigators and others in multiple groups the other day to assist the police at various sub-bureaus to search and arrest opium offenders within their respective jurisdictions. The number of those arrested and opium addicts is very large. Those who voluntarily register are even more enthusiastic. Although the other day was a day off for various agencies, the investigation and arrest continued. Currently, hundreds of opium addicts have been arrested. Except for those who have been sent to rehabilitation or received licenses, only over one hundred people have not been sent to the hospital for compulsory rehabilitation. Once a temporary opium rehabilitation hospital is established, all will be sent to the hospital for treatment. The crackdown is currently being actively carried out. The first opium addict crackdown is scheduled to end on the 20th of this month. The second crackdown will be scheduled as planned, in the hope that opium addicts can become aware and quickly surrender themselves.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Collection Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association began its fundraising campaign, in addition to the various collection teams actively seeking donations, it has also been collecting aviation patriotic donations from various industries in the city according to their business income standards. These include the hotel industry, fresh meat industry, fresh pork selling industry, freight trucking industry, brick and tile industry, dance hall industry, and sand and gravel industry.

<p>Disaster Relief is Saving Lives; Donate Just One More Copper Coin, Save One More Life</p>
<h3 id="e97">Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Reports on the Drought in Anhui Province <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road, previously reported that various legal entities in Yingshang County, Anhui Province, sent representatives to Shanghai to beg for relief due to the severe drought. Their report on the disaster situation was published in previous newspapers and attracted attention. However, few people know that the drought is rampant in Anhui Province, not just in Yingshang County. Now, the association has also received representatives from Fuyang, Linquan, Taihe, Fengtai, and other counties, or received letters from them, all stating that the drought is severe and the situation is tragic. The various reports are excerpted as follows: A letter from various legal entities in Fuyang states that since the summer, the three hottest periods have been without rain. Sorghum, beans, and taros have withered. By the Mid-Autumn Festival, the heat was more intense than in mid-summer, causing the replanting of miscellaneous grains to completely dry up. Now that it is late autumn, farmers are mostly impoverished. With all means exhausted, extending to the severe winter and spring, they will inevitably starve to death on the roads and fill the ditches. Special representatives were sent to personally present the catastrophic situation, begging for investigation and relief. A letter from various legal entities in Taihe County states that since the summer, the drought has been rampant, with no rain for months, bare land everywhere, and springs drying up at the bottom of wells, resulting in no harvest of crops. Famine is imminent, and the prospects are bleak. The four borders are desolate, and the land is barren. It is a drought that has not been seen in decades. As winter approaches, people will cry from hunger and cold, and they fear they will die in ditches. Currently, there are starving people everywhere, and relief is urgently needed. Please quickly allocate funds for relief. A letter from County Magistrate Xiang of Fengtai County reports that since the summer, no rain has fallen in June, July, and August, the fields have cracked, and the ditches have dried up, resulting in an unprecedented drought. Almost no crops have been harvested in all 94 villages in the county. Vast fields are barren, and it is a desolate sight everywhere. Now that it is just early winter, tree leaves and grass roots have been almost completely collected. People are fleeing on the roads, and famine is rampant. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people are in urgent need of relief. Please quickly allocate relief funds to save the dying victims.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Statement by the China International Famine Relief Commission: No Joint Fundraising <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment in 1921, the China International Famine Relief Commission has established branches in 13 provinces. In Jiangsu Province, only a Shanghai office is located at 505 Henan Road, Shanghai. The newly established fundraising section is attached to the Shanghai office. In the past years, it has handled emergency accounts for major floods and droughts and disaster prevention projects, raising donations through proper methods. This time, the Jianghe flood account was approved and filed by the Ministry of Political Affairs, and the receipts were stamped with the Ministry's seal to show caution. Since fundraising began in August, it has received enthusiastic support from people at home and abroad. However, recently, people have often questioned the issue of joint fundraising and have even criticized it on the phone, saying that donating thirty cents of foreign currency will bring a hope of 1,500 yuan, which is close to enticement and similar to gambling. The commission has heard about these things every day and is greatly troubled. Therefore, it solemnly declares that there is absolutely no such thing as joint fundraising. Please disclose this to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world.</p>

<p>This year's floods are extremely severe, shocking the world. Now that winter is approaching, people are suffering from both cold and hunger. Their situation is indescribably tragic. The fundraising group of the Shanghai Flood Relief Associations of various provinces is pleading for the victims in various places and has repeatedly asked for donations from all parties to provide relief. This time, in order to increase donation revenue, the group specifically held a scout mobilization for donations. The external fundraising for two days has ended, and the internal fundraising is continuing. According to the person in charge of the Scout Council, the results of the continuous revenue are very good, and the accounting is being rushed. Once they are collected, they can be announced. The group also specially dispatched someone north to invite Ms. Meng Xiaodong and Ms. Zhang Yuyun to Shanghai to perform to help raise funds. They took the stage the other day, and the grand occasion was as prosperous as before, comparable to Mr. Mei Lanfang's performance at the Golden Theatre last time. Many floral baskets and silver shields were sent from all walks of life. For example, Huang Jinrong, a celebrity in this city, presented an embroidered curtain with the words "Winding around the beam three times." Du Yuesheng presented a horizontal plaque with the words "Benefiting the victims," which was a great event for a time. There is no need for us to describe the artistic talents of Ms. Meng and Ms. Zhang. The audience has made enthusiastic comments. However, it is rare that Ms. Meng and Ms. Zhang have come south from afar and can plead for millions of victims. Their enthusiasm is very commendable. All circles are also familiar with the importance of disaster relief and are actively participating. Therefore, there are such amazing sales results. It is heard that Ms. Meng's performance of "The Empty City Stratagem" and Ms. Zhang's "The Happy Union" were both exceptionally brilliant and won a lot of applause. However, the performance period of Ms. Meng and Ms. Zhang is not long. It is hoped that all circles will come early to enjoy the performance and help with disaster relief.</p>
<p>Within the Area of ​​Road Construction Beyond the Boundary in West Shanghai: Residents Can Connect to Electricity Without Difficulty; No Need to Submit the Shanghai Municipal Council Donation Ticket for Verification</p>
<p>The electricity supply issue in the area of ​​road construction beyond the boundary in West Shanghai has been resolved since the Municipal Government and the West Shanghai Power Company signed a contract on January 4 this year. After that, all users in the area can directly apply to the company for electricity connection without difficulty. Recently, it was heard that when electrical material stores undertaking the installation of electrical equipment for users in the area apply to the company for electricity connection on behalf of the users, they claim to the users that they must show the Shanghai Municipal Council patrolmen's donation receipt to the company before they can be allowed to connect to electricity. After inquiring with the person in charge, this is not true. The area completely belongs to the Chinese territory, and the West Shanghai Power Company is a company specially authorized by the Municipal Government to operate electrical business in the area. There is absolutely no reason to ask users for the Shanghai Municipal Council's donation receipt.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Bar Association Asks for Improvement of Land Measurement Methods <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association, based on a suggestion by Committee Member Xu Zuoliang, stated that the Shanghai Land Bureau often delays land measurement matters, sometimes for several months, before the measurement can be completed. The parties involved suffer a lot of losses due to this kind of delay. It is learned that the newly appointed Director Cai of the Land Bureau is reorganizing the bureau's affairs. Should this be submitted to the joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee for discussion and forwarded to the Municipal Land Bureau to request improvement of the measurement methods? All requests for land measurement should be completed within two weeks to avoid unexpected losses for the parties involved. After receiving the suggestion from Executive and Supervisory Committee Member Xu, the association has submitted it to the 211th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee, and it has been approved on record. Yesterday, the Standing Committee forwarded a letter to Cai, Director and Concurrent Commissioner of the Shanghai Land Bureau, requesting approval to improve land measurement methods to rectify the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Shanghai Municipal Council's Vehicle Committee Reports on the Recent Situation of Rickshaw Pullers <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai Municipal Council Rickshaw Affairs Committee, the issuance of licenses for public rickshaw pullers officially ended on October 15. Since that day, only those who had been temporarily rejected before have been processed. As of November 4, the total number of licensed rickshaw pullers in the concession was 41,098. Recently, although various rickshaw owners have repeatedly stated to the committee that there is a shortage of rickshaw pullers, the committee's investigation found that there are no vehicles idle due to a shortage of rickshaw pullers at various rickshaw owners. At the same time, it is very clear that the competition among rickshaw pullers to rent vehicles is not as enthusiastic as before, and the number of people hiring rickshaws is not as many as before. This is probably due to the economic downturn. Therefore, the fares earned by rickshaw pullers are not as high as before, and it takes more effort to negotiate the price. The Vehicle Committee deeply feels that if rickshaw owners can understand the current difficulties and reduce the rental price, the rickshaw pullers will definitely be more eager to rent vehicles. Furthermore, since the beginning of this month, there have been 501 new-style rickshaws on the market. It is expected that by the end of this year, the number of new-style vehicles will increase to 1,000. From this, it can be seen that the number of passengers who support new rickshaws is increasing.

<h3 id="e103">Appeal of Pig Merchants in Northern Jiangsu: Requesting Jiangsu Surveillance Commissioner to Thoroughly Investigate Illegal Tax Collection <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The business tax on pigs in northern Jiangsu, with checkpoints set up along the way and illegal and harsh taxes levied, has been repeatedly reported by the Shanghai Fresh Pork Selling Industry Association and others. Now, dozens of pig merchants in the fourth district of Bingcha, Dongtai, including Zhang Yiyuan, Fu Xuegao, Zhang Liufu, Ye Shouyu, Shen Shumin, Sha Wenxuan, Cong Yixing, and Wu Guoqing, have jointly filed a complaint with the Jiangsu Surveillance Commissioner's Office. The original text is excerpted as follows: "We merchants, since being disturbed by the Red Bandits, followed by frequent floods and droughts, the rural areas have gone bankrupt and have no way to make a living. Fortunately, we rely on agricultural by-products, transporting pigs, to survive and maintain a meager living. In May of this year, the Director of the Dongtai Business Tax Bureau arbitrarily set up a tax checkpoint at the Jiaoxie Bingcha place, using Tao Daxing Zhahe to intercept pig boats and force them to pay taxes, collecting 20 cents for each pig. They even issued private notes, deceiving and extorting, doing everything they could. If their wishes were not met, they would be detained. Unable to swallow their anger, they mortgaged their property to report. We merchants have been abused repeatedly and have suffered multiple calamities. This year's floods are severe, and most families are impoverished. Starvation is widespread. How can our livelihood at the end of the road bear such harsh taxes? Moreover, the pig transportation business tax in northern Jiangsu, with Bao Ban Tong such as the two county business taxes, Mo Zuotang, setting up tax checkpoints in Dingyan, Baipu, Matang, Liqiao, Maqiao, and other places, densely packed like forests, all kinds of illegal and harsh abuses, cannot be described. We have appealed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to report the situation and request relief from the commercial difficulties, and we have presented it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance for a quick investigation. We then received an order from the Ministry of Finance to strictly correct the situation and again requested your office to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter. Several months have passed, and the documents are full, but the harsh pig transportation business tax in northern Jiangsu has not been reduced. Instead, the Dongtai Business Tax Jiaoxie Bingcha tax checkpoint has forcibly levied taxes. On August 29, after paying the pig tax at the Dongtai Bingcha tax checkpoint, on August 30, after passing the Dingyan tax checkpoint in Rugao, 40 miles away, the tax should have been exempted upon verification of the ticket. How could the tax checkpoint consider the Dongtai tax ticket invalid and require another payment of the pig tax? Within the same jurisdiction, this tax, that tax, actually collects taxes repeatedly along the way, even more harmful than the former Likin tax. The suffering of our pig merchants is even more indescribable. Our Jiangsu is the capital province, admired by China and foreign countries, and relied on by the whole country. Unfortunately, if each Director of the Business Tax Bureau considers the difficulties of our merchants who are forced to pay taxes for their livelihood, we will again weep and continue to present this, attaching it to your Honorable Chief for verification, imploring you to show pity, relieve the commercial difficulties, and quickly send personnel to thoroughly investigate and severely punish the illegal Dongtai Tongru Directors of the Business Tax Bureau, and order the immediate abolition of the tax checkpoints along the way that are illegally collecting and extorting taxes, in order to maintain the law and save the people. We are extremely anxiously awaiting orders."</p>

Ayer's various family medicines have been imported to your country for a long time. The people who were personally involved in the beginning are no longer alive.

<h3 id="e108">New Chinese Weights and Measures System to be Implemented in the International Settlement; Shanghai Municipal Council Passes Resolution to Implement on New Year's Day Next Year <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council believes that since the new Chinese weights and measures system was officially promulgated in 1929, it has long been implemented outside the concession with remarkable results. Now that the time is ripe, in order to show Chinese-concession cooperation, it is planned to start with adopting the standard weighing system and gradually seek the unification of weights and measures. The concession authorities plan to stipulate during the trial period that the new municipal scale should be prepared first, in order to gradually implement it. However, in order to achieve uniformity, the Municipal Council plans to issue a notice first, and afterwards, the authorities may not recognize anything other than the new municipal scale, in order to show a warning. After discussions among the various departments of the Municipal Council, it was proposed that the Police Committee recommend the following two points to the board of directors: (1) It is stipulated that whether the Shanghai Municipal Council establishes or private individuals establish vegetable markets, bakeries, candy stores, foreign food stores, vegetable stores, fruit stalls, rice stores, etc., they must all indicate on their licenses that standard new weights must be prepared by themselves. This regulation will be implemented from January 1 of the following year. (2) Issue a notice to warn all stalls that the Shanghai Municipal Council may prohibit the use of other weighing systems after six months. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Committee has now recommended to the board of directors that this new regulation be indicated on the licenses of all vegetable markets and the above-mentioned shops, and that each stall prepare the standard municipal scale promulgated by the Chinese government. At the same time, a notice will be issued to indicate the possibility of adopting the standard new system. It is heard that the above points were all approved at the regular meeting of the board of directors the other day.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Women's Groups Petition the Fifth National Congress: Issue an Order to Effectively Prohibit Prostitution <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>And formulate a constitution based on the principle of equality between men and women</p>
<p>Dagon News Agency stated that the Shanghai Chinese Women's Temperance Association and the Chinese Women's Association jointly telegraphed the Fifth National Congress yesterday, requesting that an order be issued to the whole country to effectively prohibit prostitution and formulate a constitution based on the principle of equality between men and women. The original texts of the two telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram One</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress in Nanjing: Upon investigation, the prostitution business is not only morally corrupt and depraved, but also inhumane. It leads to individual degradation on a small scale and national demise on a large scale. Therefore, all civilized countries prohibit it. Even in China before the Spring and Autumn period, there was no mention of prostitution. It can be known that the prevalence of prostitution is not allowed in a prosperous age. Since the reform of our country, although prostitution has been banned through repeated orders, those who ban ban, and those who prostitute still prostitute. This association is heartbroken and specially jointly telegraphed, asking the conference to propose and resolve to issue an order to the whole country to effectively prohibit prostitution, and to set up relief agencies as soon as possible,授and授give them living skills, so that they can seek self-reliance to rectify social customs and revitalize the nation. I cannot express my earnest anticipation.</p>
<p>Telegram Two</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress in Nanjing: Upon investigation, equality between men and women is a common practice in modern civilized countries, and valuing men over women is a barbaric custom. All family tragedies and social disputes are mostly due to the habit of valuing men over women, which is the step to disaster. Moreover, women account for half of the entire nation. If we want to seek national rejuvenation, how can we abandon this half of the women? Therefore, in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, the stipulations in politics, economy, law, and education are based on the principle of equality between men and women. All our compatriots should follow the conference, as representatives of the whole people, looked up to by the whole country, and relied on by all. The people's pain is waiting to be relieved, and national rejuvenation depends on leadership. For this reason, we jointly telegraphed, asking the conference to follow the previous situation, formulate a constitution based on the principle of equality between men and women, in order to prevent the former evils and show fairness, which is not only the blessing of women across the country, but also the blessing of the country's future.</p>

<p>He Desheng's small cigarette and paper shop, located at No. 71 Bingchang Field, Dongchang Road, Pudong, was broken into and robbed on August 8th of this year at 9:00 PM. He's wife, He Wangshi (25 years old, from Changzhou), resisted and shouted for help, whereupon the robbers opened fire, hitting He Wangshi in the temple, killing her instantly. The local bailiff, Lu Shunlong, reported the incident to the Procuratorate of the District Court, who dispatched personnel to inspect the scene, confirm the death, and arrange for the coffin and burial. Subsequently, the police arrested the following suspects: Chen Hegao, 33 years old, from Changzhou; Lu Jiwen, 26 years old, from Kunshan; and Liu Jinyuan, 41 years old, from Changzhou. They also seized a handgun and seven bullets. The case was handed over to the District Court, where Prosecutor Zhang Zi conducted several thorough interrogations and confirmed the facts. He also summoned the victim, He Desheng, who identified Chen Hegao as the one who held the handgun during the robbery and behaved ferociously. As a result, Chen Hegao was prosecuted for robbery and murder in the Criminal Court. Presiding Judge Cai Dingcheng held a public trial and rendered a final verdict yesterday at 10:00 AM, sentencing Chen Hegao to death for robbery and murder, and sentencing Lu and Liu to ten months imprisonment each as a warning. Chen Hegao refused to accept the verdict and declared his intention to appeal. Lu and Liu accepted the verdict and were ordered to be remanded in custody pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Jin Jindi, a 16-year-old girl from Funing, with some good looks, lived in a bungalow on Longjiang Road. She was a worker at the Weitong Yarn Factory on Lan Road. On December 20th of last year, her elder brother, Jin Rutian, colluded with Gao Xiaobao, a female foreman at the factory, to sell her to a brothel in Qingdao under the pretext of going to work there, earning 300 yuan, which they divided and spent. Her mother, Jin Liushi, searched without success after her daughter went missing, unaware of her brother's involvement. In the brothel, Jin Jindi primarily entertained Westerners. After two weeks, unaccustomed to this kind of promiscuity, she obtained the madam's consent and wrote a letter to Shanghai, asking her mother to prepare 200 yuan to redeem her from Qingdao. Jin Liushi went to Qingdao with the money on several occasions to negotiate with the madam, Zhu Xiaozhen. However, because the amount she brought was insufficient, she had to return to Shanghai, unable to raise the funds. Recently, Jin Jindi seized an opportunity to flee back from Qingdao. The day before yesterday, at 6:00 PM, she and her mother encountered her brother, Jin Rutian, near Pingliang Road and Qiqihar Road. They seized him and began to quarrel. Detective Jin Wanrong saw the commotion, inquired about the details, arrested him, and took him to the Yulin Road police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The lawyer from the Municipal Council, Zhang Shizhu, detailed the previous events and stated that the defendant denied the allegations at the police station, requesting an extension. Following this, Jin Liushi and her daughter Jin Jindi testified to the events, questioning the defendant, whose answers were evasive. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing to investigate further.</p>

<p>Zhao Longsheng, the director of the Pudong Fire Brigade, believed that the fire engines currently in use were outdated and the water pressure was too weak. This made it difficult to put out large fires. Therefore, he submitted a request to the Municipal Public Security Bureau last year to purchase a new large fire engine, which was commissioned to the Hengda Fire Engine Manufacturing Factory, a Chinese business located at the southern end of the Laolaji Bridge. The fire engine was recently completed. Yesterday morning, Director Zhao, accompanied by the driver, drove the engine out of the factory, passed through the North Bund of China Merchants, hired a tugboat to transport it to the Blue Chimney Pier in Pudong, and drove it back to the fire brigade. The engine is 26 and a half feet long, eight feet wide, and weighs three and a half tons. It is equipped with two main water outlets and six branch outlets, with a water pressure of 350 gallons per minute, and a range of 160 feet high and 180 feet far. It also has a small pump with a water pressure of 100 feet. The engine speed is 40 miles per hour. The engine is equipped with a three-section ladder, which can reach 48 feet high.

<p>Dadong Camel Down Increases Price: Dadong Wool Weaving Factory, No. A-18 Alabaster Road, produces Shuangshi (Double Lion), Yingxiong (Hero), and Lixiang (Standing Elephant) pure wool plain camel down, with superior materials, exquisite construction, fashionable patterns, durability, and wearability. They have long been famous and are welcomed by all sectors of society. Now, due to the shrinking exchange rate and soaring raw material prices, the factory has no choice but to slightly increase the selling price to maintain its capital. It is reported that starting today, Shuangshi will increase by two jiao per yard, Yingxiong will increase by one jiao and five fen per yard, and Lixiang will increase by one jiao per yard.</p>
<p>Domestic Glycerin Sales Increase Sharply Recently: Glycerin is a major raw material for industrial products, with a wide range of uses. Since the launch of domestic Planet Brand glycerin last year, major factories across the country have adopted it, benefiting greatly from its excellent quality and low price. Countries such as Calcutta in India, Kobe in Japan, and Rotterdam in the Netherlands have also placed orders one after another. As a result, the demand for domestic glycerin exceeds supply. Recently, domestic and foreign sales have increased even more. It is expected that if production can be increased, exports will be even more active. This is indeed the first case of a domestic scientific material being promoted abroad.</p>

<p>-- Respectfully dedicated to the comrades of the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang and gentlemen who are fond of discussing political reform --</p>
<p>Third, whether the national crisis can be resolved depends entirely on whether the entire nation, from top to bottom, can be of one heart and one mind and work diligently to fulfill their duties, and it can be said to be completely unrelated to whether party rule is abolished or whether political tutelage is ended. The current international environment no longer allows us to live our lives perfunctorily. If everyone, from the leader to the masses, can truly work hard, I do not believe that the national crisis will remain serious forever, nor do I believe that the nation will ultimately fail to revive. On the other hand, if party rule is abolished, allowing many political parties to compete and contend, and political tutelage is ended, allowing parliamentarians elected through bribery to make trouble in parliament and obstruct the government, will the national crisis not become even more serious? Will the people's livelihood revive as a result? Jiang Tingfu claims to have no affection for the Kuomintang, but he rightly said in the Tianjin Dagong Bao: "The people do not care who holds power; what they hope is that those in power can do a few major things for the country and the people." Therefore, a government of party rule or a government of political tutelage, if it can relieve the national crisis for the country and the people, will certainly be loved by the people no less than a democratic government or a constitutional government. On the other hand, if a democratic or constitutional government cannot resolve the national crisis, the people will certainly abandon it, and a government of party rule or political tutelage may one day reappear. The fact that the German National Socialist Party was able to overthrow the Brüning government and organize a one-party dictatorship government under the Weimar Constitution shows this. Jiang Tingfu also said: "Those who oppose Chiang, if they think their cause will succeed, the foreign threat will naturally stop, this is a dream. Or if they think that even if it does not stop, they will have the power to resist Japan once they gain power, this is deceiving people." This is truly speaking plainly. Those who currently oppose the Kuomintang gnash their teeth and believe that as long as they overthrow the Kuomintang's party rule and end the Kuomintang's political tutelage, the national crisis will naturally be resolved. He is either dreaming or deceiving people. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e128">General Situation of Shanghai's Textile Industry (Continued) Compiled by China Credit Information Agency (One of the General Situations of Shanghai Industry and Commerce) 3. The Actual Situation of Shanghai's Yarn Sales in Recent Years <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>To understand the major changes in Shanghai's yarn industry in recent years, it is necessary to start from its production and sales, and the slow rise and fall of yarn and cotton prices. According to statistics from the Chinese Yarn Mill Association, the number of yarn bales produced by various mills has increased slightly in the past three years, with 640,000 bales in 1932, 650,000 bales in 1933, and 670,000 bales in 1934. There are no overall figures for the first three quarters of this year. As for the increase or decrease in sales, it can be inferred from the growth or decline in the number of spot yarn transactions by various broker groups in the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange:</p>
<p>Table of Spot Yarn Transaction Volume of Various Broker Groups in Shanghai in Recent Three Years (Original Unit: Bales)</p>
<p>1933	1934	1935</p>
<p>January	--	17,636	17,569</p>
<p>February	--	11,390	19,071</p>
<p>March	13,801	13,680	46,104</p>
<p>April	28,878	26,376	24,886</p>
<p>May	20,352	37,235	25,516</p>
<p>June	19,507	27,826	26,691</p>
<p>July	27,163	26,056	27,811</p>
<p>August	15,754	32,149	21,938</p>
<p>September	22,134	35,858	31,085</p>
<p>October	27,548	42,773	--</p>
<p>November	20,238	33,428	--</p>
<p>December	11,369	34,068	--</p>
<p>Monthly Average	26,674	28,206	26,741</p>
<p>In terms of annual data, the customer sales situation this year is slightly worse than last year, but compared with the previous year, it is still slightly better. In terms of monthly data, customer sales in March this year were particularly strong, increasing by more than 30,000 bales compared to last year and the year before, so after March, they turned downwards, and then became strong again in September. Overall, customer sales in each month of the first three quarters of this year were more than the same period in the previous year, and there were also ups and downs compared with the same period last year, so the future prospects may be promising.</p>
<p>The accumulation of stockpiled yarn is indeed one of the important symptoms of Shanghai's yarn industry during a difficult period, but it has been continuously decreasing in the past three years. In August of this year, Shanghai's stockpiled yarn reached an unprecedented low level, which is indeed a sign of turning danger into safety.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai's yarn industry fell into a difficult situation for many reasons, which have been briefly mentioned before. In addition, expensive cotton and cheap yarn were the industry's fatal wounds. The following is a comparative explanation of the market prices of standard cotton and standard yarn:</p>
<p>An examination of Shanghai cotton prices shows that the average price in 1934 increased by 3% compared to 1933, while yarn prices in the same period fell by 7%. Although cotton prices fell sharply this year, yarn prices also fell accordingly. If 1933 is taken as the base year, yarn prices are still lower than cotton prices, which is a major problem for Shanghai's yarn industry. We need to eliminate the monopoly of raw cotton, improve transportation, and reduce raw cotton freight to find a solution.</p>
<p>As for the current cost price of machine-made cotton yarn, taking the selling price of 16-count Ren Zhong brand yarn at 168 yuan per bale as an example, it can be analyzed as follows: 1. Each bale requires 350 catties of cotton, currently priced at 32 yuan per 100 catties, totaling 110 yuan; 2. Fixed capital and labor: 27 yuan; 3. Factory profit: 8 yuan and 42 fen (factory profit will increase or decrease depending on the rise or fall in yarn prices); 4. Interest: 12 yuan; 5. Unified tax: 8 yuan and 58 fen. However, the cost of transporting cotton yarn from Shanghai to the inland areas is also quite high, depending on the distance, as follows: 1. Shanghai to Nanchang: freight 12 yuan, store profit 5 yuan, totaling 17 yuan; 2. From Nanchang to Linchuan: freight 4 yuan, interest 3 yuan, store profit 3 yuan, totaling 10 yuan, so each bale must be sold at 185 yuan in Nanchang and 195 yuan in Linchuan, otherwise, it will be sold below cost. This calculation of cost price is what those who care about industry and commerce should pay attention to.</p>
<p>The evolution, status, and production and sales of Shanghai's yarn industry have been discussed above. Now, let's measure the prospects based on the Ministry of Finance's new monetary policy. According to the new monetary law recently promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, the purpose is to stop the redemption of paper currency to prevent the outflow of silver, to control exchange rates externally, and to increase prices internally. Since last autumn, overseas silver prices have risen sharply, and domestic prices have been affected, falling relatively, and yarn prices are no exception. If the new monetary policy can proceed in an orderly manner, it may have a good impact on the Shanghai yarn market.</p>

<p>Regarding the state of illiteracy in various countries around the world, according to numerous surveys and statistics by domestic and foreign education experts or educational institutions, there is already a rough approximation. Here, the illiteracy rate in various countries is recorded as a percentage: Denmark, Sweden, and Luxembourg have no illiteracy; Switzerland has an illiteracy rate of 0.03%; Germany is the same; the Netherlands has 0.23%; the United Kingdom has 3.7%; Japan has 0.94%; Finland and Norway each have 1%; England has 1.8%; the Union of South Africa has 0.99%; Estonia and Ireland each have 3%; Spain has 3.7%; Austria has 4%; New Zealand has 4.17%; Australia has 1.8%; Australia has 4.3%; the United States has 5%; Canada has 5.7%; Czechoslovakia has 7.7%; France has 8.9%; Belgium has 9.3%; Latvia has 14.72%; Hungary has 15.2%; Newfoundland has 22.7%; Poland has 24.9%; Italy has 27%; Ceylon has 33.3%; Honolulu has 36.3%; Argentina has 37.9%; Uruguay has 39.8%; Ecuador has 40%; Yugoslavia has 43.4%; Lithuania has 44.1%; Bulgaria has 44.5%; Yugoslavia has 49%; Liechtenstein has 49.7%; Cuba has 52.4%; Costa Rica has 52.6%; Puerto Rico, El Salvador, and British Guiana each have 55%; the Philippines has 55.5%; Greece has 57.2%; Bulgaria has 58.4%; Romania has 60.16%; Mexico has 62%; the Federated Malay States has 62.6%; Colombia has 67.52%; Portugal has 68%; the Dominican Republic and Panama each have 70%; Nicaragua has 72%; Venezuela has 72.1%; Russia has 72.4%; Brazil has 75.5%; Syria has 80%; Bolivia has 84%; India has 87.95%; Guatemala has 89.08%; Palestine, Haiti, and Siam each have 90%; Egypt has 91.1%. The average illiteracy rate for the above 60+ countries is 37.7%, and the median is 39.9%. As for China, according to statistics from last year, the illiteracy rate is approximately 66.7%, but due to the active promotion of compulsory education and mass education in recent years, the percentage should be lower.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Guangdong Province Promotes Compulsory Education: Central Government Subsidies for Compulsory Education Expenses Arrive Successively; Fifty Designated Counties to Add Short-Term Elementary Schools <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Department of Education recently promoted compulsory education and decided to subsidize impoverished counties to establish short-term elementary schools to accommodate out-of-school children in those counties. It also received approval from the provincial government to allocate funds for subsidies. These subsidized short-term elementary schools have been opened one after another. Recently, the national treasury also subsidized Guangdong Province with compulsory education funds, totaling 30,000 yuan for the three months of July, August, and September, which has already been remitted. Therefore, the Department of Education has also designated 50 counties—Sanshui, Sihui, Guangning, Enping, Heshan, Xinxing, Yunfu, Luoding, Xinyi, Yangchun, Yunan, Deqing, Gaoming, Chixi, Raoping, Dabu, Jiaoling, Wuhua, Puning, Lufeng, Haifeng, Heyuan, Zengcheng, Boluo, Conghua, Longchuan, Pingyuan, Zijin, Huilai, Wuchuan, Suixi, Qinzhou, Yanxian, Wanning, Danxian, Lingao, Qiongdong, Renhua, Shixing, Nanxiong, Lechang, Lianxian, Huaxian, Huazhou, Dianbai, Lianjiang, Dingan, Chengmai, Heshan—to add five short-term elementary schools in each county. The salary for each school principal and teacher is fixed at 35 yuan per month. The following matters requiring attention when opening short-term elementary schools in each county and city have been determined: (1) For each county stipulated to receive subsidies within the measures, regarding the subsidized short-term elementary schools to be opened, in addition to those already opened, the opening fees and office expenses must be carefully planned and reported within fifteen days of receiving the document, according to the stipulated amount, and the school address must be selected. The personnel dispatched to each county should cooperate and quickly prepare for the opening of school. The schools that should be established by the county at its own expense should be established at the latest by the beginning of the next semester. (2) Counties that have not received subsidies must also establish at least five short-term elementary schools within one month of receiving the document, with classes starting at the beginning of the next semester. (3) Each county must, before December of this year, divide the elementary school districts in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3 of the measures, including the total number of elementary school districts in the county, the number of short-term elementary schools and ordinary elementary schools planned in a certain elementary school district, the number of students to be accommodated, the amount of additional funding to be raised, and the number of classes to be expanded. A detailed plan must be reported to the Department for review. (4) Each county and city must formulate measures for the establishment of short-term elementary schools within one month of receiving the document and report them to the Department for record.</p>

<p>—Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"Does it hurt, Don?"</p>
<p>"It's a bit bad; but I didn't want to wake you up."</p>
<p>"I'm like an owl, always running around at night. Yes, your foot is really like fire: those bandages need to be wetted again," said the mother owl, flapping her wings to get more cold material and a large bottle of ice water.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's good!" Don let out a long sigh as the soaked cloth was wrapped around his foot again, and he drank once, giving his parched throat a refreshing feeling.</p>
<p>"Now, sleep well, and if you see me again, don't panic, because I'm going to sneak in and take a look again, and give you another cold application."</p>
<p>As dawn approached, she re-entered his room, and found him sleeping soundly. He was unaware when she changed the gauze for him, but the traces of pain on his face gradually faded away, and by the time she left, his face was in an extremely calm state.</p>
<p>The second day was Sunday, and the house was very quiet, so he didn't wake up until noon. Looking around, he saw a small face with an eager expression peering in at the doorway. He stretched out his arms, and Tommy ran straight across the space and fell on the bed, shouting, "My Don has returned!" He held him tightly, and was so happy that he squirmed all over like a little worm. Mrs. Bhaer then came in with breakfast, and Tommy insisted on feeding it to him himself, so he fed him like a child, but since Don wasn't very hungry, he rather liked it.</p>

<p>(Kaifeng Correspondence) The Wang sisters, Chunqing and Chunwei, performed for the second time, starting at 2:00 PM today (the 10th), still at the tennis courts of the New Games. The audience reached the level of the first day. The first match was between the Wang sisters and Tong Zhiren and Chen Jingpan. The two sides were evenly matched and did not give way to each other. In the end, the Wang sisters lost 5-7 due to insufficient stamina. The second match was the singles match between Henan's famous player Lu Xifen and Wang Chunqing. When the male and female players met, they each showed their strengths. Chunqing took the lead and made direct shots into the two corners with great strides. Lao Lu struggled extremely hard, and several times failed to save the ball due to being too tired. Lao Lu took a defensive posture, and Wang attacked Lao Lu with forehand and backhand shots, which won the audience a lot of applause. After Lu won the first game, Wang won two consecutive games. Lu then won two more games, and Wang responded with force, chasing after her. When luck came, she attacked with spin balls and succeeded. After Wang won another game, she gradually ran out of steam. Lu seized the opportunity to attack with long shots and short blocks, winning two consecutive games. Although she barely won 7-5, it was a hard-fought victory. The last match was the mixed doubles between Lu Xifen and Wang Chunwei against Chen Jingpan and Wang Chunqing. Wang and Chen won the first set 6-1, and Wang and Lu won the second set 6-3. The match ended in a tie after each side won one set. Due to the cold wind, the match was ended. It is reported that tomorrow (the 11th) they will perform at the provincial government, and will take the train back to Taiyuan in the evening. The results of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Tong Zhiren and Chen Jingpan 7——5 Wang Chunqing and Wang Chunwei</p>
<p>Lu Xifen 7——5 Wang Chunqing</p>
<p>Lu Xifen and Wang Chunwei 1—6, 6—3 Wang Chunqing and Chen Jingpan</p>

Qinghei overwhelmed Shaonian, becoming the perennial champion of the Qingnian group. Jianxing won the championship of the Zhuangshi Guo group without effort due to Maodun's forfeit. Shanghai Bai defeated Chun Guang, dominating the Zhuangshi Yi group. Among them, in the match between Heming and Minghu B, Minghu B was actually no less skilled than Heming. However, due to an excessive desire to win, their actions became too intense. The spectators close to the team also cheered loudly, providing extreme stimulation, causing the players' performance to deviate from their usual state. Near the end of the first half, the center player exhibited improper behavior and was ordered off the field by the referee. Losing a good player, they suffered successive defeats in the second half. Lacking moral cultivation, they suffered technical humiliation, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>(Note) The match between Maotai and Tiedui in the Zhuangshi Xing group at 3:20 PM this Saturday afternoon is canceled because Tiedui has already forfeited twice. According to the rules, their qualification is canceled, and Maotai team does not need to attend. The Wenhua team of the Zhuangshi group has also forfeited twice, and their qualification is canceled according to the rules.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Prevention of Intestinal Tuberculosis <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Intestinal tuberculosis (also known as intestinal TB) is the formation of tuberculous nodules on the intestinal mucosa. It often follows from pulmonary tuberculosis. The cause is that patients cannot expectorate phlegm but swallow it into the stomach. Because the sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients contains countless aggressive tubercle bacilli, swallowing it into the stomach creates a disease nest where they multiply. However, the acidic gastric juice in the stomach has an antiseptic effect, which can prevent the development of tubercle bacilli. Therefore, in the early stages of pulmonary tuberculosis, when the stomach is still healthy, even if countless tubercle bacilli invade, there is no major problem. However, as the disease slowly progresses, from the first stage to the second stage, and then to the third stage, the body gradually weakens, resistance decreases, and the secretion of gastric juice naturally decreases. The acidic fluid that inhibits tubercle bacilli becomes severely deficient. As a result, the tubercle bacilli in the stomach become active and multiply, and they enter the intestines. The intestines are the place where tubercle bacilli most easily multiply, so the symptoms of intestinal tuberculosis begin to appear.</p>
<p>The symptoms of intestinal tuberculosis are, initially, one or two soft stools per day. Before defecation, there is abdominal pain and a rolling sensation in the abdomen. There is fatigue and weakness, food is not easily digested, and there is often discomfort in the lower right abdomen. After a while, the symptoms become more severe, and the number of bowel movements increases. These are the common symptoms of intestinal tuberculosis. These symptoms persist for a long time and are not easily cured immediately. The diarrheal state is also not severe, with slight diarrhea from time to time. This is a characteristic of intestinal tuberculosis. Therefore, chronic diarrhea in tuberculosis patients should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Prevention of intestinal tuberculosis An investigation of pulmonary tuberculosis patients shows that most develop intestinal tuberculosis when they reach the second or third stage. The reason is that they swallow their phlegm. Therefore, the prevention method is that pulmonary tuberculosis patients, even in the early stages, must strictly prohibit swallowing phlegm. They should often use a 3% Kali Chlorat solution to gargle and take "Lung Vital" ThithWeal internally, which has antiseptic and bactericidal effects. It can also inhibit abnormal acidic fermentation in the stomach, stimulate appetite, and promote the absorption of nutrients from food. Thus, the patient's nutrition is improved. These few points can be said to have special effects.</p>
<p>Treatment of intestinal tuberculosis The primary cause of lung disease must be treated with all efforts. Taking "Lung Vital" in the early stages can often cure mild cases. If it has reached a severe stage, in addition to taking "Lung Vital" PhithWesl on time, a doctor should be consulted for injections and various physical therapies. At the same time, natural therapies such as fresh air, nutrition, and rest should also be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e150">New Treatment for Scrofula and Adenopathy <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Guanqun</p>
<p>Scrofula has a close relationship with lung disease. The average person is well aware of this. Scrofula is tuberculosis of the cervical lymph nodes. It is the most common disease in the world, affecting both adults and children. Many people die from pulmonary tuberculosis caused by scrofula, because tuberculosis of the lymph nodes is most likely to affect the lungs.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been mention of children with an adenopathic constitution, meaning a thin, emaciated physique, a sallow complexion, an inexplicable reason for weakness and frailty, and a generally sickly appearance. When ordinary people see this, they often say, "Isn't this child suffering from adenopathy?" which raises suspicions.</p>
<p>Adenopathy is when lymph nodes are infected by tuberculosis, resulting in weakened function and obvious weakness. Children suffering from adenopathy are prone to developing scrofula or pulmonary tuberculosis. Therefore, parents of children with an adenopathic constitution are often worried and seek advice from doctors on how to maintain their health and recover. However, if proper treatment is not given in the early stages, there will be a day of regret. Therefore, although there are various treatments for scrofula and adenopathy, the most definitive and effective complete treatment is during the early stages (i.e., the lymph node tuberculosis stage). If the lymph node tuberculosis progresses further—to the pulmonary tuberculosis stage—it becomes somewhat difficult. However, if it is only in the scrofula or adenopathy stage, recovery is often possible. The method is to "devote oneself to nutritional therapy." Among the tonics used for scrofula and adenopathy, medical professionals generally agree that "Connour's San-Vita-Cell" is the most effective. According to the editor's experience, if taken continuously for three months without fail, the body will become strong, and the symptoms will disappear. Although the time required varies depending on the severity of the disease, it generally requires a long time. Therefore, patients must be persistent and untiring, and they will not fail to recover. Therefore, this type of therapy is considered the most definitive treatment for scrofula and adenopathy in today's medical theory, without any doubt.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Lung Capacity and Health <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Shen Xiangbo</p>
<p>The oxygen that we inhale from the air is only partially exchanged with other gases in the lungs. The other part remains in the lungs. This remaining air is called residual air, and it is about 1200 cubic centimeters. The amount of air inhaled during a normal breath is about 500 cubic centimeters. However, after exhaling the air in the lungs, if one tries harder, one can still exhale a large amount. The amount of air that can be completely exhaled after a normal inhalation, followed by a deep inhalation, is called lung capacity. This amount varies depending on race, individual, age, etc. The average lung capacity of British people is 3700 cubic centimeters. The average lung capacity of Swiss people is 3200 cubic centimeters. The average lung capacity of people of East Asian descent is 3300 cubic centimeters for students and 3930 cubic centimeters for laborers. In general, the stronger the body and the taller the stature, the greater the lung capacity. For ordinary young and middle-aged men of East Asian descent, a lung capacity of 3200 to 3300 cubic centimeters can be considered a strong physique. For women, about three-quarters of that of men, i.e., about 2400 cubic centimeters, can be considered healthy.</p>
<p>Editor's note Those who are infected with tuberculosis are, in fact, prone to lung diseases due to physical weakness and lung weakness—insufficient absorption of oxygen and elimination of carbon dioxide. To prevent this, one must practice deep breathing to improve gas exchange, and it is even more important to take internal medicines to nourish and strengthen the lungs. When I examine people with physical weakness and lung weakness, I always recommend using "Lung Vital" PhithWeal, because this product contains important medicines for strengthening and healing the lungs. Those who are weak can take it to strengthen their body and prevent tuberculosis. Those who are already sick can take it to recover early. I have seen that all those who have taken "Lung Vital" have become physically stronger—with larger lung capacity. Even those who have been diagnosed with tuberculosis by doctors have recovered their health in a short period of time. Because the results of my practical experience are so good, I record them to inform my compatriots.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Great Effect of "Lung Vital" Phith Weal on the Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Currently, the most noteworthy and valuable treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis in the world is "organ therapy." Among the preparations of this type, the only one recognized by medical professionals as truly effective is "Lung Vital" PhithWeal, produced by the Swiss Tiebi Pharmaceutical Factory, due to its outstanding efficacy. Chinese and Western scholars have described it in detail, so I need not dwell on it. However, because this agent has made special and great contributions to patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, I will record its clinical progress to inform the world.</p>
<p>First Case Mr. Yang, 37 years old, merchant.</p>
<p>Chief Complaint Cough, shortness of breath, night sweats, blood in sputum,</p>
<p>Loss of appetite, emaciation, etc.</p>
<p>Diagnosis Left-sided pulmonary tuberculosis (second stage)</p>
<p>Treatment Process I instructed him to keep strictly quiet. I gave injections of Glucalcin, Helpin, etc. After about two weeks, the symptoms showed slight improvement. Because the patient wanted to return to his hometown of Anqing to recuperate, he stopped the injections. I prescribed a prescription for him to purchase medicine to take back internally. I told him to purchase a dozen bottles of "Lung Vital" PhithWeal from Chinese and Western pharmacies and take them according to instructions. Two weeks ago, I received a letter from him stating that after taking two bottles, the coughing and shortness of breath disappeared, the night sweats decreased, and there was no blood in the sputum after taking the medicine. His appetite had slightly increased. I wrote back and told him to continue taking it. Later, on the 4th of this month, I received another letter and an X-ray photo. Upon examination, the lesion, which was originally a progressive exudative tuberculosis of the lower left lobe, had now become a static connective tissue proliferation forming a scar, and it was indeed on the path to recovery. According to the letter, all symptoms had disappeared, and he was full of energy and had a ruddy complexion. He asked if he was cured and whether he should continue taking the medicine. I told him to use another half-dozen bottles to seek a radical cure. I also told him to add "Connour's San-Vita-Cell" to improve his nutrition, so that his body could recover quickly and there would be no worries about recurrence. The other day, Mr. Yang suddenly came to thank me. He said that such a stubborn disease, after only three months, had been cured and he was able to return to the store to resume work, which was like being reborn. He expressed endless gratitude.</p>
<p>Second Case Mr. Gu, 24 years old, student.</p>
<p>Chief Complaint He had suffered from nocturnal emission for three years. He was cured this spring after taking "Huantonger". However, his body had not fully recovered its health. In May, he suffered from a severe cold. After the illness, he became even weaker. Then, a cough broke out, especially in the morning and evening. He had taken various lung medicines on the market, but they were all ineffective. Recently, the disease suddenly worsened, with symptoms such as night sweats, hemoptysis, and loss of appetite. His body was emaciated, and shortness of breath developed with even slight exertion.</p>
<p>Diagnosis Right-sided pulmonary tuberculosis (second stage)</p>
<p>Treatment Process He came to see me on September 28th of this year. I strictly ordered him to keep absolutely quiet. I prescribed antipyretic, stomachic, expectorant, and antitussive agents. After more than ten days, there was no visible effect. I then advised him to undergo injection therapy, but the patient refused. I ordered him to change to internal medication. I immediately told him to take "Lung Vital" PhithWeal. After taking it for twelve days, the cough gradually subsided, and the temperature dropped to 37.2 degrees Celsius. After taking it for another two weeks, his appetite greatly increased, and all symptoms disappeared. After taking it for another month, he achieved a complete cure. However, his body was still thin and had not fully recovered. I told him to add the nourishing and strengthening agent "Connour's San-Vita-Cell" for a dozen days, and his weight suddenly increased. His spirit was revitalized, and his body became visibly plumper. Mr. Gu was fortunate to have been cured of his dangerous pulmonary tuberculosis thanks to "Lung Vital", and he recovered his nutrition thanks to "Connour's San-Vita-Cell", so he expressed endless gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e153">A Tonic for Weak Patients <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Yiqing</p>
<p>Taking tonics and getting blood-boosting injections is what most weak patients hope for. However, if you look at the various preparations on the market, there are really too many types. The question is whether they are effective and suitable for weak patients. For example, both cod liver oil and vitamin A pills are known to be nourishing tonics, which is indeed correct. However, when it comes to long-term pulmonary tuberculosis patients - and people with very weak stomach Yang power, these oils and capsules are not only difficult to digest and unhelpful to the body, but also promote diarrhea. Even appetite, digestion, and absorption are affected by them. The result is that one wants to strengthen - but instead becomes weaker. Isn't that counterproductive!</p>
<p>In short, if a weak patient wants to use nourishing and strengthening agents, first, the nourishing and strengthening agent itself must not harm the digestive organs; second, it would be better if it could be directly absorbed. In this regard, "Connour's San-Vita-Cell" is recognized by medical professionals from all countries as the most appropriate!</p>
<p>Because the ingredients of "Connour's San-Vita-Cell" are the artificially digested products of animal protein, that is, the various important "Amino Acids" that are most relevant to the human body, and it is also formulated with various other strengthening and blood-boosting agents. In other words, it does not require the digestion of stomach Yang and can achieve the purpose of nourishing and strengthening. This is why it is particularly suitable for people with pulmonary disease and weakness!</p>
<p>Since I started using "Connour's San-Vita-Cell", I have now tested it on more than forty people. Among them, only six people died from severe pulmonary disease. The rest turned from weak to strong. Among them, there were many patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and neurasthenia. I find this tonic to be of low price and great efficacy, so I am happy to publish and promote it.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Neurasthenia Lecture (1) <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>(1) The Harm of Masturbation</p>
<p>Masturbation is a prevalent bad habit. Burke said, "If there are a hundred young men, a hundred of them masturbate. As for young women, it is certain that ninety-nine out of a hundred have this habit. As for the remaining one, it is probably because she is unwilling to declare the truth." This habit is a product of modern civilization. The more advanced the culture, the higher the standard of living. Consequently, marriage becomes more difficult. Even approaching prostitutes and other women is impossible due to economic constraints, leading to an increasing number of evils. As material civilization advances, nervous disorders such as hysteria and neurasthenia also increase. Therefore, many scholars believe that there is a causal relationship between neurasthenia and masturbation.</p>
<p>The harm of masturbation varies depending on the strength of the constitution, the age, and the method and frequency. Those who are young and weak, and who engage in it daily, will inevitably suffer from nervous weakness, lack of strength, and a host of diseases. The harm is even greater when spring passions are aroused. It not only damages the nerves and depletes physical strength but also hinders the development of the reproductive organs, leading to extreme deformities and functional impairments, completely cutting off reproductive function. The happiness of life is utterly wasted. A promising young man is transformed into a pitiful and useless cripple. I will further discuss the resulting diseases in the following article. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: For those suffering from neurasthenia and reproductive organ disorders due to excessive masturbation—such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, and insufficient brainpower—resulting in headaches, dizziness, insomnia, forgetfulness, and other symptoms, in addition to strictly adhering to a regulated lifestyle, one can take the endocrine preparation "Welitonic" and the brain-boosting tonic "Conbour's San-Vita-Cell" to quickly restore health. I have personally tested it on many people and found it to be truly effective. Therefore, I write this to inform those suffering from the same illness.</p>
<h3 id="e155">The Danger of Whooping Cough <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yiqing</p>
<p>Whooping cough is a contagious disease that specifically affects children. It is caused by a microorganism that invades the respiratory system of children. Children under the age of seven are most likely to contract it, and even newborns can suffer from this condition. It is often transmitted through the air, toys, clothing, and utensils. Once a patient appears in a family, the siblings will inevitably be infected one after another. The symptoms of the disease—after an incubation period of two to seven days—present as simple bronchitis symptoms. Coughing lasts for about one to two weeks, followed by paroxysmal spasmodic coughing for about four to five weeks. In mild cases, the attacks occur three to thirty times a day. In severe cases, sixty to a hundred times. Eventually, the attacks gradually decrease, and recovery is possible in two to three weeks. The course typically lasts more than two months and sometimes extends to six or seven months.</p>
<p>When children suffer from this disease, they often develop various complications. The most common is bronchopneumonia. Most children who die from whooping cough do so because of bronchopneumonia. In essence, whooping cough itself does not cause fever. If fever of 38 degrees or higher occurs and persists for two or three days without decreasing, there must be a complication. In addition to bronchopneumonia, attention must also be paid to meningitis, otitis media, and pulmonary emphysema, which often occur concurrently with whooping cough.</p>
<p>When children suffer from whooping cough, hernias may sometimes develop—such as umbilical hernias and inguinal hernias—but these are not life-threatening and should not be feared. After the disease is cured, pulmonary tuberculosis often develops. Children with poor nutrition and glandular disease almost always develop pulmonary tuberculosis after suffering from this disease. Therefore, special attention must be paid during the recovery period of whooping cough. The prevention of whooping cough requires isolation to prevent infection. It is most important that sick children do not come into contact with other children.</p>
<p>The treatment of whooping cough requires careful attention to avoid catching a cold again after the onset of the disease. Choose easily digestible liquid foods that are nutritious. The room should be clean, bright, and well-ventilated. Mental tranquility is essential. All mental stimuli such as joy, anger, fear, and shock, as well as sensory stimuli such as loud sounds and bright lights, should be avoided. Currently, there is no specific medicine for the treatment of this disease. Although there is a whooping cough vaccine injection therapy, its effectiveness is not yet perfect. General physicians treat it by adopting symptomatic treatment, giving cough suppressants and sedatives when coughing attacks occur.</p>
<p>Recently, the medicine "PhithWeal" has been used for whooping cough. It can clear the lungs, relieve coughing, dissolve phlegm into water, reduce inflammation, sterilize, and prevent bronchopneumonia, shortening the course of the disease. Therefore, doctors widely appreciate and use it. The author has also experimented with it many times and found it to be truly effective. Moreover, this product contains no toxic substances and tastes very sweet, making it especially convenient for sick children to take orally.</p>
<p>Whooping cough, in the eyes of ordinary people, may seem insignificant. In fact, the number of deaths is several times higher than that of infectious diseases such as measles. Complications make it even more dangerous. It is especially dangerous for young children. Therefore, it is necessary to take "PhithWeal" as soon as the disease starts and to take great care of oneself to avoid bronchopneumonia.</p>
<p>The course of this disease is very long. Many people die during this time due to physical weakness. Therefore, great attention must be paid to nutritional supplementation during the recovery period. Among the nourishing tonics suitable for children, "Conbour's San-Vl-ta-Ce" is the best and can also prevent the development of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<h3 id="e156">On Speculation in the Publishing Industry <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Lü</p>
<p>Some lament the speculation and commercialization in the publishing industry. Publishing is a type of business, and in the modern era of commercial warfare, businesses must speculate to find a way out, make money, and avoid losses. On closer examination, this is an extremely normal phenomenon: the so-called "transformation" is not real, but rather a "true color." Speculation is one of the skills of commerce, one of the skills of true colors. If the publishing industry does not speculate, it is not a business. If it is a business but does not speculate, then publishers can only drink the west wind [i.e., be impoverished].</p>
<p>I am not a publisher; nor am I defending the speculative commercial publishing industry. My point is: in the modern era of commercial warfare, speculation and commerce are both normal terms; to put it bluntly, they are normal behaviors. To criticize the publishing industry with such terms is foolish and inappropriate, equivalent to blaming someone who makes a living by gambling, saying: "Why do you gamble!"</p>
<p>To outsiders, speculation in the publishing industry is indeed abhorrent, damaging the dignity of cultural endeavors, but they themselves see it as extremely ordinary, extremely legitimate. They believe that engagement in the publishing industry, based on commercial forms, can only be this way. Why? Because modern commerce is precisely this way: without speculation, one cannot stand firm.</p>
<p>The current publishing industry is ultimately just a business, and business ultimately requires means.</p>
<p>Therefore, merely cursing the speculation in the publishing industry, while fundamentally correct, is not very suitable for the situation. Cursing speculative publishers for losing their conscience, while fundamentally flawless, does not understand the hardships of those being cursed. To criticize the decline of the publishing industry, one should point out the root of its decline.</p>
<p>The current decline of the publishing industry is obvious and undeniable. So, how did it decline? The publishing industry does not "love" to decline; there is another reason that forces them to decline in this way. This, in a narrow sense, is speculation; but it is also not "love" of speculation, but rather the necessity to speculate under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>This certain circumstance, this reason, in my view, should be attributed to a larger topic: the social and economic recession.</p>
<p>This topic is too big for me to discuss. My intention is merely to speak up for the publishing industry.</p>
<p>When the economic situation is good, the publishing industry will naturally be able to improve and avoid speculation. This is very obvious: we only need to look at how the books published by a few well-capitalized bookstores are more serious and solemn, while the books published by small bookstores are haphazard and careless, to understand.</p>
<p>In such a helpless situation, directly rebuking the publishing industry: "Hey! How dare you speculate!" or shouting: "Hey! No speculation allowed!"... These will not succeed. We can only: on the one hand, hope that the root cause of the social economy will improve, and on the other hand, hope that publishers will retain some conscience within the possible range. We can only hope, not demand—because it is impossible to demand.</p>
<p>But conscience can only exist when there is surplus. The current publishing industry is in dire straits, and it is probably difficult to find anyone willing to discover their conscience. —This is why our publishing industry is helpless!</p>
<p>Speculation means keeping up with the trend. If it is a good trend, then this speculation will be a good phenomenon, because because of everyone's speculation, it will promote the trend to be more lively and broader, that is, to make the publishing industry more prosperous, richer, and more vibrant. But if the trend is bad, speculation can have a bad effect. Because there is so much speculation, the bad trend will become even more rampant, becoming a flood, impossible to clean up.</p>
<p>So speculation is not always bad. Good or bad also depends on the trend. The trend is stimulated by the readers' taste direction. Then, starting from the readers' taste to diagnose and treat the bad situation of speculation, may also be a fundamental method.</p>
<p>This should be the task of educators, critics, and writers. Although the readers' taste direction is also related to speculation; but compared to the above-mentioned "experts," the responsibility of publishers is relatively less.</p>
<p>Regarding the current speculative situation in the publishing industry, I feel that irresponsible educators, critics, and writers not only are not responsible, but also have the power to promote it.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the harms of speculation in principle. In addition to directly promoting bad trends, speculation also has more subtle harms.</p>
<p>For example, take publishing a book. The content of the book caters to the trend. If the trend being catered to is a bad trend, then needless to say, that book is already bad. If the trend being catered to is a good trend, then according to the rules, it should be a good book, but no, it is still a bad book.</p>
<p>The passing of trends is also very fast. Especially in our Chinese "circles." For example, in literature, a trend often lasts for many years in the West, but in China, it only takes a few months. Therefore, for a book to catch up with the trend, or even the highest point of the trend (the highest point of the trend sells the most), it must also be produced equally quickly. The maker of the book must rush to make it, and the publisher must rush to print it, so they only care about speed and not about quality—no, they don't even care about being presentable. As a result, even if the book has a good topic, it is still a mess. The trend is finally caught up with, and readers who are enthusiastic about the trend regard a yellow cow as a horse [i.e., accept something inferior as good], not carefully examining the quality of the content, just reading, just reading, and perhaps even think it is a good book after reading it—because they think it is a "product of the times." The publisher, of course, has earned some money, and when all their attention is focused on money, of course there is no room for "conscience" to appear, completely ignoring what impact that book has on the unfortunate readers.</p>
<p>Speculation on bad trends is of course bad; but speculation on good trends often cannot avoid mistakes: that is, this kind of rough and shoddy production.</p>
<p>The method of diagnosis and treatment is the same as above: to treat the root cause. But on the one hand, it also depends on the three "experts" to fulfill their tasks: educators tell readers "what kind of books are bad books," critics point out "which one is a bad book," and writers make a good one, compare it with the bad one, so that people can clearly see its badness.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Review of Wang Wenru's Edited and Proofread "Complete Works of Gong Ding'an" <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Shu</p>
<p>The Complete Works of Gong Ding'an, one of the six famous works of Sinology published by the World Book Company, was popular for a time. But this book is actually the 1909 Guoxue Fulun Society edition, with only a few supplementary notes added on the outside. The former book was titled Edited and Proofread by Hao Haozi, while this book is titled Edited and Proofread by Wang Wenru. Now, the prefaces of the two books are largely identical, suggesting that they are the same person. We have three points to say about this book.</p>
<p>First, the preface by Wang at the beginning of this book states: "During the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods of the Qing Dynasty... Ding'an rose among them... extending to the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, he was revered as the Gong school... The posthumous collections were circulated and evaluated by several famous scholars... I have seen about dozens of scholars who all could express their insights, compiled and recorded them, but over time, their names have been forgotten." This means that the evaluations in this book were compiled by him. But this is not the case. After Wu Xu's preface in the Guoxue Fulun Society edition, there is the inscription "In May of Yìwèi (1895), Gong Huan's two notes: 'Zhang Junshì combined the three families of Zhu Xinyuan, Sun Qiushi, and Yanghu Zhao Huifu's reading versions for proofreading. Now it is proofread based on Shizhi's version.'" Wang's preface is forty years later. Furthermore, at the end of the sequel, there are three notes titled "Huang Xingyuan's Notes," one of which states: "This is Cheng Pushun's version of the Gong Ding'an Wenji, punctuated by a common scholar. It is recorded from the original engraving of Ding Gong's own notes, with occasional additions, which Jiang Jianxia, a court official, once recorded. Now it is copied again." It can be seen that the compilation of evaluations existed as early as forty years ago with Gong Fuhuan, and Huang Xingyuan (or one and the same person) unknown how many years before 1909, which means that Wang fabricated a lie to deceive people.</p>
<p>The only addition in this book compared to the Guoxue Fulun Society edition is the effort of supplementary notes. This may be Wang's achievement. However, these supplementary notes are of unknown origin and have been arbitrarily altered, which is very wrong. Now, several common examples are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Inappropriate Selection of Materials—This is a common problem throughout Wang's book, that is, he used indirect materials as much as possible. For example, the note on the Inscription for the Spirit Path of Zhuang Gong in the Collected Works, page 278 of the first volume, states: "Wu Changshou said, 'In the year of Wuxu, Zhuang Qing Shan hosted Ding Gong's family, and spoke of the beauty of his ancestor Zhuang Gong Cunyu's deeds, and also said that the inscription was not yet complete. In the year of Jimao, when Ding Gong was in the capital, he met Song Yuting, the grandson of Zhuang Gong's daughter, and again inferred Gong's aspirations, and in that year, less than three days before abandoning human affairs, he gathered all the words and selected the most important ones to write the Inscription for the Spirit Path of Zhuang Gong.'" Wu's words are recorded in his own compiled Chronological Biography, without specifying its basis. Now, Chen Li's handwritten notes on the Collected Early Works of Ding'an reveal that his book contains many of Ding'an's own notes. The Inscription for the Spirit Path of Zhuang Gong entry states: "In the year of Wuyin, the Jiaqing period, Zhuang Jun Shou hosted me in his house, and one evening spoke to me of the beauty of his ancestor's deeds, and also said: 'The inscription is not yet complete.' That evening, Shoujia dreamed of Gong twice, as if he had something to entrust. The next day, Shoujia asked for it. In the year of Jimao, I met Song Xiangfeng, the grandson of Gong's daughter, and Xiangfeng inferred Gong's aspirations in this way for me. In the year of Renwu, less than three days before abandoning human affairs, I gathered all the words and selected the most important ones to repay Gong, Ding'an's own notes." The circulated versions of the Collected Early Works of Ding'an are extremely rare. Wu himself claimed to have "searched and obtained one volume." Then it can be known that what is said in the Chronological Biography is based on Ding'an's own notes. He recorded the year of his writing as "Renwu year, less than three days before the end of the year," so Wu slightly adopted his words and compiled them under the year of Renwu, the Daoguang period, changing "Renwu" to "that year," in order to facilitate the writing and avoid complexity. However, Wang did not notice this and followed his text, which the reader will never understand. Also, Wuxu in Wu's text is the 43rd year of Qianlong, when Ding'an was not yet born, or the 18th year of Daoguang, which is already fifteen years after the Collected Early Works were engraved in the year of Guìwèi in the third year of Daoguang, clearly knowing its mistake. The self-note is "Wuyin" as the 23rd year of Jiaqing, which is exactly five years from the time of writing in Renwu. However, Wang still followed Wu's mistake. Because Ding'an's Collected Early Works are not easy to find, it is understandable to use indirect materials, but there are many that are clearly from this collection, yet he still uses those. For example, the note on the 140th Miscellaneous Poem of the Jihai Year states, "Wu Changshou said, 'Ding Gong once presented the strategy of planting mulberry trees in Beizhi in the north to the senior officials of Ji Fu, and when passing through Suzhou, he presented the strategy of water conservancy in Wuzhong to the Chief Administrator of Lushān. His concern for the people and things was always present.'" Wu's words are based on the original title of the 21st Miscellaneous Poem, "Presenting the strategy of planting mulberry trees in Beizhi in the north to the senior officials of Ji Fu," and the original title of the 140th Miscellaneous Poem, "Presenting the strategy of water conservancy in Wuzhong to the contemporary scholar Yu Lushan, the Chief Administrator." Wang instead quoted his words as a note, not knowing what benefit there is. Wang's supplementary notes mostly take Wu's Chronological Biography as a basis. At the same time, Wu's Chronological Biography mostly takes this collection as its basis. Wang can be said to have mistaken his mother's home.</p>
<p>2.  Inappropriate Citation—This can be said to be forced association. For example, the note on the Praise for Zhi Guizi in the Collected Works, page 11 of the second volume, states, "Ding Gong was frustrated and fled to Zen Buddhism, liked Western books, and claimed to have reached deep subtleties, so he wrote this praise." According to Wei Yuan's Ancient Micro Hall Outer Collection, volume three, the preface to Ding'an Wenlu states, "(Ding'an) especially liked Western books in his later years and claimed to have reached deep subtleties." It is clear that Wang's words are a wrong transcription of these two sentences. The year in which the Praise for Zhi Guizi was written is unknown. However, this article has been included in the second volume of Ding'an's Collected Early Works, which shows that although it is not an early work, it was before the third year of Daoguang. At that time, Ding'an was not yet "frustrated and fled to Zen Buddhism," nor did he "claim to have reached deep subtleties." How could it be as Wang said, "therefore he wrote this praise"? Ding'an's later Buddhist achievements are in Ding'an's Separate Collection engraved by Deng Shi. This praise is not qualified to relate to Ding'an's own words.</p>
<p>3.  Inappropriate Excerpts—For example, the note on the eighth Miscellaneous Poem states, "Dai Chunshi said: 'This mountain does not speak and looks at the Central Plains, it is truly able to express the feelings of West Mountain.'" According to Dai's words in his own Compiled Idle Talk of the Suffering Studio, volume two, the original text states: "A certain Ministry Official of Gong Ding'an once said to me! 'West Mountain sometimes seems vaguely separated from the outer clouds, and suddenly falls before the desk, regardless of wind, rain, sunshine, or haze.' His poem about West Mountain says: 'This mountain does not speak and looks at the Central Plains,' it is truly able to express the feelings of West Mountain." We read Dai's original text very clearly, but after being cut off by Wang, it is headless and tailless.</p>
<p>Wang's achievements in studying Gong for more than ten years—these supplementary notes can be said to be worthless. Annotation is also a kind of literary criticism (in the broad sense), which is extremely important. However, scientific annotation must be based on textual research, the attitude must be faithful, and the materials must be direct (if there are no direct materials, the entire text should be copied). Unfortunately, Wang's supplementary notes stand on the exact opposite side, so they are the most unscientific and the most unfavorable to scholars' research.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this book's self-proclaimed "complete edition" is also deceiving. If the Complete Works of Gong Ding'an published by the Guoxue Fulun Society in 1909 said this, it would not be an exaggeration at all. But this is the 1935 edition. In these more than twenty years, many posthumous writings have been discovered. As far as I know at this moment, there are two complete sets. One is Ding'an's Separate Collection engraved by Deng Shi (1910), in the Fengyulou Series; the other is Ding'an's Posthumous Works and Outer Chronicles of Ding'an engraved by Zhang Zuliang (1921), in the Juanjinglou Series. And a little earlier, there are Anecdotes of Yú Língshānmín, in the Guoxue Series, which can be compared with the Chronological Biography. Ding'an's Literary Gleanings are mostly his academic essays, which can be included. Other items such as Notes on Duan's Annotations to Shuowen (in the Continued Classics Explained) can also be included. In short, this complete collection adds nothing to the 1909 Guoxue Fulun Society edition and cannot be considered a complete edition.</p>

<p>(4) General Manager</p>
<p>In various bookstores, the powers and status of the general manager are different, which is determined by the nature of the bookstore's organization. In name, the powers and status of the general manager are supreme in the bookstore, and in practice, although some bookstores are like this, there are also those who are no different from ordinary shop assistants. The reason for this is determined by the way the general manager is produced. If the general manager is the owner of the bookstore, then the general manager's powers are not only supreme, but also last as long as the bookstore. For example, the Li brothers of Beixin, Mr. Zhang of Shanghai Magazine Company, and Mr. Zhang of Kaiming are all owners or founders and concurrently general managers. On the other hand, general managers who are hired entirely—no, who are entirely hired, some have power, while others are very useless. For example, Mr. Shen Zhifang of the former World Book Company, and the deceased Mr. Hong Xuefan of the Modern Book Company, both had great authority in their bookstores, almost no different from those "sole proprietorship owners concurrently serving as general managers." In addition, we know that Mr. Wang Yunwu of the Commercial Press can almost be said to be a "dictator," and the current General Manager Zou of the Life Bookstore also has great power. It is said that at the welcome party for Mr. Zou's return to China, the Life Bookstore colleagues sang "Our General Manager" in unison, a grand occasion unprecedented in the publishing industry. At the same time, there are also many general managers who come without any purpose and leave without any reason. For example, the general manager of the former Crescent Moon Bookstore was replaced almost every few days, and it is often difficult to determine who the current general manager of Huatong is.</p>
<p>The work of each new bookstore has two major parts: one part is publishing books, and the other part is business operations. How to promote business operations is naturally the responsibility of the general manager, but there are some problems with publishing. Apart from those general managers who are useless and have no right to interfere in publishing matters at all, the important reason is that every general manager may not have the same experience in publishing as they do in business operations. I ask, among the general managers of various bookstores, how many can, like Mr. Wang Yunwu, read thousands of books on scientific management abroad in a month? Therefore, there are often disagreements between the general manager and the editor-in-chief, either because the general manager wants to interfere in publishing matters and the editor-in-chief is unwilling, or because the general manager and the editor-in-chief disagree on publishing opinions. Because the general manager is biased towards the "business perspective," while the editor-in-chief may not have any experience in the "business perspective," this is the main point of conflict.

<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>In this industrially backward China, not to mention the lack of development of large industries, even small industries are very immature. Compared with European and American countries, everywhere is a source of shame. I often talk about this with Mr. Chen Diexian, and Mr. Chen is very interested in vigorously promoting it. Recently, Mr. Gu Bingyuan returned to China after inspecting industries in Europe and America, and greatly praised their small industries, which can be described by the eight words "exquisite, delicate, and just right" to describe all the supplies. Mr. Gu brought back many small handicrafts for our national products industry to study, such as kitchen knives, fruit knives, shell removers, degreasers, wrinkle removers, polishers, fire starters, flower makers, and lighting equipment related to clothing, food, housing, and transportation. They all feel novel, exquisite, and small, and the prices are cheap and the applications are especially important. Every dish and utensil is a product of their small industries, and everyone praises and enjoys using them. I think many small objects are easy to imitate. Mr. Gu bought them back to contribute to the national products industry, and his detailed explanations of their uses are especially admirable. For example, a small package of tea and cigarettes is beautifully decorated and accompanied by detailed instructions, explaining the brewing method and effectiveness, which can be sold at a good price. I hope that colleagues in the national products industry, in addition to separately imitating the specialized industries, will also use new patterns and ingenious functions, and each exert their efforts and each specialize in their strengths to create various small crafts to supply social needs, and not allow imported goods to occupy the market. Mr. Zhang Boling said, "Europeans and Americans create, the Japanese imitate, and the Chinese do not create." Now the Japanese have moved from imitation to creation, and will we Chinese continue to stagnate in non-creation, enjoying the finished products of others? How can we face others, how can we deal with ourselves? Comrades who are interested in small industries, hurry up!</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Future of National Goods After Currency Reform <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>The currency reform issue, which had been brewing for a long time, was finally officially implemented on the 4th of this month with an order from the Ministry of Finance. This is a major reform by our government of China's entire economy, and it has the greatest effect of promoting and protecting our national goods industry. It is worthy of our collective attention and a review of its causes and effects by all those engaged in the national goods business.</p>
<p>Because China has always been a country with an import surplus, the international balance of payments can never be balanced. In the end, the only way to pay for it is to use cash, and in recent years, precisely because of the above reasons, silver has been flowing out in torrents, and China's silver reserves are in danger of being exhausted, and the disintegration of the entire national economy has become a matter of time. Therefore, this time, the government resolutely implemented the new currency system, adopting currency issuance and prohibiting the use of cash, precisely to try to manage the currency, stabilize finance, so that silver can be concentrated, and the entire industry and commerce can enter a new stage. In particular, our national goods industry, on the one hand, can have an active trend in export trade due to the reduction of foreign exchange parity, while the import of foreign goods, on the contrary, will increase costs. After that, it will be difficult for them to dump goods in our country's market. On the other hand, due to the unification of paper money issuance and the concentration of reserves, there is no fear of currency contraction, chips can be increased, and credit can be expanded, so that the national goods business can flourish. Other benefits, such as stimulating price increases after the implementation of the new currency system, are also of great benefit to the future of national goods.</p>
<p>However, those of us engaged in the national goods business should not be too optimistic. The future of developing national goods still requires us to proceed with greater prudence. Everyone knows that in the current stage, there are two paths that national goods factories should take. First, we must strive to seize the opportunity to make gradual progress, seek to expand the domestic and foreign markets, promote the progress of export business, and pay attention to the import of foreign goods after the reduction of foreign exchange parity, and compete and deal with them strongly. Because the cost of foreign goods themselves has been raised, in this instance, it is necessary to overthrow their latent power in the Chinese market and replace them with national goods. Second, we must try to use this plan to expand the manufacturers themselves, take advantage of the circulation of currency, the increase of chips, and the expansion of credit, and strive to increase the manufacturers' greater productivity, improve the quality of products, improve sales techniques, and make all equipment more rational.</p>
<p>In short, this currency reform is undoubtedly beneficial to the prosperity of the entire industrial sector, but what is most needed is the efforts of our manufacturers themselves. In this good opportunity, we must strive to develop domestic and foreign markets, improve our own organization, consolidate external credit, and establish the foundation of a strongest national industry.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Promoting National Goods and the Baojia System <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>Recently, Chinese people, in view of the dumping of foreign goods, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and the critical state of the national economy, have risen up to promote national goods. However, if we examine the past achievements calmly, I am afraid it is difficult to satisfy people! Just because promotion is promotion, foreign goods are still used: this is very painful! However, promoting national goods without a strict organization is also futile. Now the most pressing organization for the people is the Baojia system. If it is used to promote the national goods movement, it will be several times higher than empty talk on paper, right? —Now I will write down the method of using the Baojia system below:</p>
<p>The matter of advocating the use of national goods should be brought up at the Baojia conference for discussion. The implementation methods should be listed in detail. After public discussion and approval, it should be recorded in the Baojia regulations, signed and sealed by the Baojia chief, and the household head should also sign it. It should be hung in a public place and a copy should be submitted to the district office for safekeeping. On the one hand, the Baojia chief should inform the Jia chief of the significance of using national goods and social recovery, and the Jia chief should inform the household head, and the household head should inform the whole family to comply.</p>
<p>On the day when the use of national goods begins, the Baojia chiefs of each township should hold a joint oath-taking ceremony, guided by the district chief and supervised by the county chief. At the same time, the public is welcome to participate. After taking the oath, in addition to the household head guaranteeing to the Jia chief, the Jia chief to the Baojia chief, the Baojia chief to the township chief, and the township chief to the district chief that they will not use foreign goods, they must also provide mutual guarantee documents to supervise each other. Once a deliberate violation is found, it should be immediately reported to the district level for the most severe punishment.</p>
<p>The staff of the district office should set an example and use national goods: another national goods inspector should be sent to various places at any time to investigate and guide. I think that this method, if implemented with determination, will definitely be effective!</p>
<h3 id="e162">Our Country's Paper Windows Can Transmit Ultraviolet Rays <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Chengzhao</p>
<p>In the early autumn of this year, several experts in electro-optics among the members of the Mechanical Research Association of New York City, USA, specially studied the paper windows of old-style buildings in our country. The results proved that this kind of paper windows is very suitable for scientific use, because it can transmit ultraviolet rays in the sun. This kind of ultraviolet rays gives us great benefits. According to Mohr's test, if some oil is applied to the paper window, the transmittance of ultraviolet rays is stronger. Now most of the lung disease sanatoriums in the United States have switched to using paper windows from our country.</p>
<h3 id="e163">A Visit to the China Nail Manufacturing Company <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>It is shameful to say that we cannot even provide ourselves with a nail, and we need to rely on imports, and a large amount of money flows to foreign countries. What a shameful thing this is! According to the Customs report last year, in addition to those manufactured by foreigners in factories in our country, the import of round nails reached more than 240,000 barrels. Countrymen, pay attention! Don't despise it just because you can buy a few for a copper plate.</p>
<p>The China Nail Manufacturing Company was founded in November of the 20th year. Its progress is faster than that of ordinary factories, and it is worth visiting. The factory is located on Funing Road, Yangshupu. Manager Qian Junxiang studied in the United States for many years and specialized in machinery. After returning to China, he organized the factory with his friend Mr. Ye and others. They have been working hard for five years.</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, there are currently sixteen nail making machines, which can produce eighty barrels of round nails (commonly known as foreign nails) per ten hours (each barrel weighing 100 pounds). The nails produced have the following advantages: (1) The nail head is round and neat, and the thickness is appropriate; (2) The nail teeth are deeply cut and firmly secured; (3) The nail body is straight; (4) The nail tip is sharp and easy to enter the wood. In addition to nail making, the factory also has eight wire drawing machines, which draw coarse wire into thin wire for nail making, which can greatly reduce costs. There is also a paper clip machine. In the future, we will have domestic paper clips to use, and we will no longer need to rely on imports. It is said that it is sold by the China National Goods Company for one dime per box. There is also a barbed wire machine, which specializes in manufacturing iron wire products.</p>
<p>In this year of national goods, it is indeed commendable that such excellent national goods are available, so I am happy to introduce them.</p>

<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the legal tender policy, the people have been bewildered and disturbed for a time, and prices have been stimulated to rise! The exchange rate of subsidiary currency is chaotic! After the financial authorities announced that it was neither currency inflation nor a paper currency policy, and the mint continued to mint coins as usual, and there was still silver as the backing for the legal tender, and after the strict prohibition of profiteers by the Social Affairs Bureau, the disturbances gradually calmed down, and the people silently purchased national goods with national currency, which became more and more enthusiastic! It cannot be said that it is not a major optimism in the midst of the currency reform!</p>
<p>In today's serious national crisis, we must not be tempted by the sweet talk of what... to carry us, and forget that we are living in a dangerous situation! Welcoming people with honey in their mouths and swords in their bellies, and slackening the psychology of external unity, now the officials in the government have united in spirit, and on the banks of Stone City, they are vying to see the virtuous and heroes discuss national affairs together. If we, a mob of the people, do not rise up to support the national policy and vow to use national goods, we will not be able to avoid the shame of being cold-blooded animals and the regret of biting our navels!</p>
<p>If the skin is gone, what will the fur cling to? The author hopes that in everyone's heart, there is a connection between using national currency to purchase national goods! In the last few dozen days of the "Student National Goods Year," we will wait quietly for the International Trade Bureau to announce the figures that there is no longer an import surplus!</p>

<p>Banks Actively Selling; Market Initially Firm but Weakened; Ultimately Increases by Four Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market was initially firm but weakened yesterday. Although market sentiment was good, the exchange rate was difficult to rally due to the large supply from banks. The fluctuations during the day were still narrow, but much more active than in the previous few days. It was somewhat stagnant in the middle, which is a normal phenomenon as the swap point approaches. It was found that overseas silver markets had been squeezed during the period when the market was closed due to the Mid-Autumn Festival. The pound sterling depreciated, the U.S. dollar remained flat, and the forward silver price in Montevideo fell by one to five li. Exchange rates all depreciated, the price of raw gold in London fell by half a penny, and market sentiment was firmer. The lack of supply in the over-the-counter pre-market trade caused the price to rise from 50 yuan to over 52 yuan. Fuxing, Yongda, and Decheng and others bought. The central bank's official exchange rate announcement showed that the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar were both flat, the customs gold unit fell by four li, and the standard gold price was lowered to 1147.9 yuan. After the market opened, there was no momentum to increase, and sellers took advantage of the high price to become active, gradually moving downstream.

It was learned that the HSBC official exchange rate showed that the pound sterling was flat and the U.S. dollar depreciated by 0.0625. At this time, banks also hedged, and the price rose slightly. The white silver equalization tax announcement showed no change, and it hovered around 50 yuan. The banks continued to sell, and the large accounts sold off, and the exchange rate was agitated, the selling pressure gradually became unsustainable and turned weak, but the buyers took advantage of the low price to buy bars, and it maintained. It is predicted that the Indian silver will fall by one anna. The trend at noon was hovering. Now the half-day market situation is recorded below.</p>

Hengyu was still selling. It is predicted that Indian silver will fall by a small anna. The market situation stabilized, and after hovering, the market closed at noon at 1148.9 yuan. The market was stable after the close.</p>
<p>The closing price was the central bank's standard gold price of 1147.9 yuan. According to the closing price, it was raised by about 1 yuan, which was more than 1 yuan higher than the previous close. The registration price for this month was 1139 yuan, and for December was 1149 yuan. The morning top-up was 1139 yuan. The price of red gold was reduced by 3 yuan to 1149 yuan. The spot market situation was stable. Tianjin goods were priced at 4 yuan, and red gold was priced at 5 yuan, but there were no transactions. The swap point was also quiet.</p>

Foreign interbank lending rates gradually decreased, with a rate of 1.13, the same in the morning and afternoon, shrinking another two points compared to the previous day. The opening always remained white. Given such a market sentiment, the market sentiment stabilized. The supply and demand of money lending was adjusted evenly, and the long-term pledge became active. Yesterday, 890,000 were newly created. The trading of discount tickets also increased compared to the previous week. The morning market transfer was over 4.2 million, new transactions were over 500,000, and the afternoon market transaction was over 400,000. The transaction in the small general meeting was over 600,000. The amount of banknotes issued was over 2.4 million, with over 1.3 million in other provinces. Foreign mortgages were redeemed for over 900,000, and new ones were created for over 1.2 million. On the receipt and delivery side, because the premier's birthday was a holiday the day before, the receipt and delivery were suspended, so it was slightly more prosperous yesterday. The receipt and delivery of foreign bank bills was over 4 million, the receipt and delivery of various goods and remittances was over 4.8 million, the telegraphic transfer was over 600,000, the special remittance was over 800,000, and the difference gold settlement was over 500,000. The receipt and delivery of Chinese bank bills was over 4.8 million, the receipt and delivery of various goods, remittances, taxes, and sundries was over 5.2 million, the telegraphic transfer was over 600,000, the special remittance was over 700,000, and the difference gold settlement was over 400,000. The receipt and delivery of Japanese bank bills was over 4 million, the receipt and delivery of various goods and remittances was over 4.3 million, the telegraphic transfer was over 600,000, the special remittance was over 900,000, and the difference gold settlement was over 300,000. The receipt and delivery of money shop foreign public bills was over 57 million, the receipt and delivery of foreign opening lines was over 12 million, and the various remittances were over 600,000. The subsidiary currency market situation was secretly hovering, down 0.005 yuan from the previous day, at 1.1998 yuan. Only 3,000 jiao of single coins were traded in the early market, and 110,000 jiao of double coins were traded in the early market, and 40,000 jiao were traded in the afternoon market. The copper coin market situation has not risen or fallen for a long time since the legal tender was set. Yesterday, it suddenly increased by 15 qian, to 315 qian. The reason was that the public bus company had a large number of copper coins for sale, and the market supply exceeded demand, so the market price that broke through the legal number appeared. The number of transactions was 21,420 strings, totaling 6,800 foreign yuan. In addition, the total number of bills in the Shanghai Joint Reserve Committee Bill Exchange was 22,341,632.82 yuan in national currency, including the total number of exchanges of 14,946,568.07 yuan, the total number of collections of 4,345,037.38 yuan by the money industry, and other 3,050,027.37 yuan. In addition, the interbank lending rate for the Seventh Seas Bank Industry Association Joint Reserve Committee was 0.15 yuan per thousand yuan per day, and the discount rate for public bills was 0.2 yuan per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Securities: Spot Prices Lower Than Futures; Bullish Sentiment Emerges in Public Bonds, Prices of Various Bonds Fall by More Than One to Two Dollars <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the deteriorating environmental news and various rumors, people were frightened and the market turned weak. In particular, spot trading suddenly became lively, with market prices more than two dollars lower than futures, indicating a lack of confidence. The emergence of the December contract of Bond 48 showed the shock caused by the environment. Several major players, including Bonds 6, 47, and 54, as well as northern traders, were actively selling. The exit of these large investors undoubtedly had a reason. Bond 96 also saw significant selling, and the bullish defenses appeared to be wavering, making the future difficult to view optimistically.</p>
<p>At the opening bell yesterday, various trading groups were selling, with Bonds 4, 6, 20, 21, 47, and 48 all offered for sale. Bond 78 saw some buying, but market prices generally declined, ranging from $0.23 to $0.67. Only the December contract of Bond 20 was forcibly raised by $0.30, with some bullish attempts to rally prices in secret, but to no avail. In the afternoon session, the major players mentioned earlier continued to sell, and Bond 54 also tried to unload its holdings. Salt Revenue bonds plunged by $1.60, and Bond 96 fell sharply by $1.335. The overall trend appeared weak.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, selling pressure remained strong, with the same few players continuing to sell. With the support of Bonds 34 and 78, Salt Revenue bonds were raised by $0.56, but the supply still exceeded demand, and prices fell again, by $0.35. Market prices ultimately fell by more than one to two dollars. The total transaction volume was 31,166,500 yuan. The results of the price fluctuations are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Stocks: American Stocks Tend to Sell Off</p>
<p>According to a report from Sincere &amp; Co., yesterday (December 12) the New York stock market saw thin trading and declining prices. Bullish traders, fearing a market reversal, and also due to concerns about the situation with the French currency, all sold off. The rise in shares of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Securities Company was for an unknown reason. Other railway shares declined. Stocks on the smaller exchange were slightly lower. The bond market was mixed. The total volume for the day was 2.14 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>

<p>The yarn market saw gains in the morning and declines in the afternoon, and the situation is gradually becoming calm. Spot yarn sales are becoming quieter. After the price increase, purchases from various sources have slowed, and the market is weakening. With the delivery period for this month approaching and actual demand weak, there is a lack of buyers. According to some surveys, considering the recent yarn sales situation, there are concerns that yarn inventories may increase.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Brand Soars in the Morning, Declines in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Before the auction of spun yarn, the market opened with overseas cotton industries rising across the board. There was a lack of sellers, and the market price rose slightly. By the second auction session, news of a sharp rise in raw materials caused the yarn market, which is closely related, to enter an upward trend. However, spot yarn trading was not active, and the market was still flat. The third closing auction saw continuous gains of several corners. As a result, the closing prices for each month were 8 or 9 corners to $1.00 or $1.20 higher than the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened and remained stagnant, as spot yarn sales were sluggish. The total transaction volume for the day was only 400 bales, with Japanese yarn accounting for the majority. It was also reported that public bonds fell by $2.00 in the morning. Longfeng and Daji, both bullish traders, sold off again. By the second and third auction sessions, prices suddenly fell. By the end of the session, Tongji also sold off, and the market became particularly loose. The downward trend was more intense. As a result, the prices for each month fell by $1.20, $0.50, $0.40, $0.70, and several corners compared to the morning closing price.</p>
<p>It was found that Tongji sold 700 bales, Daji sold 1,500 bales, Jinchang sold 600 bales, Gengfeng sold 1,600 bales, Taichang sold 650 bales, Hengde sold 450 bales, Shenji sold 550 bales, Changfeng sold 850 bales, and Runkang sold 650 bales. The buyers were Hexing (600 bales), Hengyi (400 bales), Shenchang (650 bales), Yuanyi (500 bales), Tonghe (650 bales), Xincheng (1,150 bales), and Ruidai (1,050 bales). The highest and lowest prices, as well as the closing prices for the day, are as follows:</p>
<p>Spun Yarn Auction　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Change　Inventory</p>
<p>November　193.7　191.8　191.8　Down 0.70　20,250</p>

<p>Total　161,300</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Continue to Shrink</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are shrinking. According to statistics, the total purchase by various trading groups for the day was only 460 bales. The market was flat, with thread prices rising by $2.3. The purchase volume of each trading group is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland　100　Nanjing　5　Haizhou　55</p>
<p>Guangdong　30　Counterparts　70</p>
<h3 id="e170">Over 4,000 Pieces of Spot Cotton Are Transacted <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market initially rose, then fell, and finally rose again by $0.20 to $0.30. With American cotton trending upward and Indian cotton also rising, market sentiment was good. Buyers became more confident, and market rumors were rampant. The loading of Chinese cotton for export was active. In the afternoon, due to the weakness of the yarn market, prices suddenly fell back. However, banks and some bullish traders remained firm.</p>
<p>Zheng Auction Ends with a Slight Increase</p>
<p>Before the auction of raw cotton, the market opened with American and Indian cotton markets trending upward, and market sentiment was increasingly confident. Xincheng, a bullish trader, added to their position, pushing prices even higher. The prices for each month jumped up by $0.40 to $0.50. The second auction session remained flat. The third closing auction saw a sharp rise in prices, with bullish traders aggressively buying. The April contract surged by $0.50. As a result, the closing prices for each month were $0.40, $0.50, $0.80, $0.90, $1.00, and $1.50 higher than the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the auction market saw an excessive rise in the morning, and the yarn market declined. Changfeng and Changhe, both bullish traders, continued to close out their positions. Market prices suddenly weakened, and the market gradually declined. Spot cotton purchases by Japanese merchants remained strong. As a result, the closing prices for each month fell by $0.35 to $0.50, $0.60, and $0.80 compared to the morning closing price.</p>
<p>It was found that Dafu sold 4,600 dan, Changji sold 1,300 dan, Dachangcheng sold 1,500 dan, Yudai sold 1,100 dan, Yuandai sold 1,200 dan, Shenchang sold 2,500 dan, Yichang sold 1,700 dan, Changfeng sold 5,600 dan, Xinheng sold 1,500 dan, Ruiyuan sold 1,900 dan, and Changhe sold 2,600 dan.

<p>Spot cotton consumption is very active, with 4,770 pieces transacted. Purchases by Japanese merchants remain strong. Local Yong'an and Shenxin factories also have healthy appetites. The sources include Yao cotton (1,560 bales) and Tongzhou cotton (3,960 bales).</p>

<p>Recently, there has been much discussion in the market regarding the export of Chinese cotton. Some say that Japanese merchants, after the revision of the legal tender system, find it more profitable to use Chinese raw materials. Therefore, the cotton market is exceptionally firm, and bullish traders are aggressively pushing up prices. In addition, recent estimates of American cotton have been reduced by more than 300,000 bales, leading to a continuous increase of 65 points, making market sentiment even firmer. Indian cotton is also following suit. According to reliable sources, yesterday, Dong Cotton, Nissin, Jiangshang, Yinghua, and other foreign firms transacted 15,000 dan of Shanghai cotton at a price of 50 yuan (Japanese currency) and 5,000 dan of Tongzhou cotton at a price of 52 yuan (Japanese currency). All were baled and shipped to Japan. This has made speculators even more eager to hoard, and market prices are rising steadily, resulting in a daily trend of rising prices with no declines. It is found that on November 4, the highest peak of the December contract of raw cotton futures was 43 yuan, and today's closing price is 42 yuan and 5 cents, only 9.5 cents different. On the same day, the highest peak of the December contract of spun yarn futures reached 204 yuan, and today's closing price is 193 yuan and 2 corners, still 10 yuan and 8 corners short. It can be seen that the gap between cotton and yarn prices is widening, and the cost of cotton yarn is continuously increasing. Yarn sales remain weak, and manufacturers are finding it particularly difficult.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with positive overseas news and unfavorable weather. Foreign firms, industry peers, brokers, and outsiders all bought, and the short positions were all absorbed. The prices for each month rose by 8 to 10 points. Then, bullish traders closed out their positions, leading to a partial correction. Finally, the public and Wall Street bought, and market prices rose again. Spot cotton prices are very firm, and new transactions are blocked. The textile market is firm and quiet.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Cotton Exchange, last week in the Southern market, spot cotton sales to direct cotton merchants reached 261,000 bales, compared to 242,000 bales the previous week and only 79,000 bales in the same period last year. The closing was firm and high, with spot prices rising by 20 points and futures prices rising by 22 to 26 points. British cotton spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices fell by one point. Indian cotton initially firmed due to purchases by a small number of European exporters and short covering. Later, the public, seeing a large increase in the closing price, became fearful and sold off, leading to a price decline. Dhollera fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Oomra rose by half a rupee, and Broach rose by 0.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (December 12 telegram):</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market first rose sharply, then fell back down. The market was chaotic and unpredictable. Although Chicago and Canada prices continued to fall by $0.30 to $0.40 at the opening in the morning, and the opening price for this month was slightly weak, the market was driven by rumors from outside the industry that Customs Gold would soon increase in price. As a result, the Bank of Communications and Jin trading group bought in large quantities, and market prices for each month gradually rose. New records were continuously broken, and market prices were $0.03 to $0.04 higher than the closing price at the beginning of the week. However, major factories successively sold off at high prices, so the future market sentiment was slightly weaker.</p>
<p>By the afternoon session, rumors began to spread, with the initial news being that factories had ordered foreign wheat. Bullish traders sold off en masse, causing a sharp decline that reversed the gains from earlier in the week. These fluctuations were entirely driven by market sentiment, with no real substance.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market opened with news that Customs Gold would increase to 2.5 yuan. Market participants, both within and outside the industry, pushed prices higher on the expectation that imports of foreign wheat would become impossible. Although trading was not very active, market prices rose quietly. Near-term contracts such as November and December rose by as much as $0.10 compared to the market at the beginning of the week, and January and February contracts rose by $0.07 to $0.08.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, the initial factor was the decline in the flour market, which dampened market sentiment. Then, rumors spread that factories had ordered foreign wheat at a price of 6.6 yuan, causing widespread fear. Everyone sought to sell, and market prices plunged by about $0.10. To safeguard the people's food supply, it is necessary to encourage these purchases, which will naturally ease market sentiment.</p>
<p>The spot wheat market remained stable. High-quality wheat was still quoted at 5 yuan, but no transactions were seen. Kai Shaoxing wheat was quoted at 4.83 yuan, Hezhou wheat at 4.81 yuan, and Xia Shi wheat at 4.7 yuan. Fuxin and Shenda purchased 650 bags.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's supply from various trading groups was around 30,000 stones (totaling more than 6,000 stones). Sales were sparse, and the market was soft. Thick Xin Geng rice was slightly lower, and Nangang early rice fell by $0.10 to $0.20. For thin rice, the Tianjin and Qingdao trading groups continued to purchase more than 2,000 bags. The mid-range market was flat, while high-quality materials were still acceptable. Du Yangjian's initial trend was similar, but it changed to flat. Broken rice saw a dismal scene.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) The supply was around 33,000 to 34,000. Sales were slow. The market was slightly better in the morning, but weak in the afternoon. Market prices for high-quality white rice remained firm, while mid-range and lower-quality rice were weaker, with a slight decline of a few cents to nearly $0.10. Thin rice and late-season rice declined slightly. Du Yangbu Jian's retail sales were normal. The price trend was stable, and customers inquiring about high-quality materials were scarce. The rest of the goods did not see much fluctuation.</p>

<p>Soybeans rose by $0.50 due to the decline and subsequent rise in soybean oil, leading to an upward trend in the soybean market. This also triggered a wave of hoarding. The market price rose by $0.05 to $0.06. In addition to hoarders, there were also purchases from the Fu, Shan, and Guang trading groups, with a total transaction volume of over 3,000 bags of various soybeans. Sesame seeds were actively purchased by foreign firms. Yesterday's statistics showed a transaction volume of 4,600 to 4,700 bags of various sesame seeds, with prices rising by around $0.10.</p>

<p>Yesterday's situation in the foreign Indica rice market remained unchanged. Due to the abundant supply of river-transported rice and rice stored in warehouses, local merchants had no interest in foreign Indica rice. With limited demand from northern regions, the market focused on shipping out stored rice. New transactions were minimal, making it difficult for market prices to rise. However, the cost of recent arrivals has increased, and major hoarders remained confident, which should help to support the market. The Tianjin trading group purchased 200 bags of Jiangxi late rice and 266 bags of Ningbo late rice. Local merchants purchased 511 bags of Jiangxi early rice, 100 bags of Hunan oil rice, and 550 bags of Wenzhou Indica rice. The market situation was similar to the previous day, with the transaction volume being small and the market remaining weak. New arrivals continued to flood the market. Yesterday, 2,113 bags of newly arrived Fuzhou new-milled rice arrived on the Wanshang Wheel. It happened at a time when liquidation was stagnant, and there has been no formal sale yet.</p>

<p>Silk prices have been rising steadily for the past two months, but they have recently declined slightly. This is because silk markets in New York and Yokohama have been declining daily, leading to a weakening of the firm market sentiment in Shanghai.

<p>Yesterday's foreign tea market saw continued strong sales of green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. Transactions for precious eyebrow and gongxi teas were active. Among them, high-quality precious eyebrow tea saw a continuous price increase of $4.00 to $5.00 due to a sharp increase in overseas demand. Shrimp eye pearl tea saw even greater demand, but there was a lack of inventory and limited raw material supply from inland areas, resulting in supply not meeting demand. Inventories of other varieties such as needle eyebrow and show eyebrow teas were also low.</p>

<p>— (Physician Chen Peiji)</p>
<p>Any man who frequents brothels and unfortunately contracts gonorrhea, either neglects treatment or receives inappropriate medication, leading to a condition that lasts for months or years, eventually becoming a chronic gonorrhea that cannot be completely cured. This not only endangers the individual but also infects his wife, resulting in male infertility and female sterility. It is said that gonorrhea can eradicate a family line, and there is good reason for this. Chronic gonorrhea, commonly known as chronic leukorrhea, involves a discharge that is intermittent and may not cause significant pain. This is because once the disease becomes chronic, the gonococci often penetrate deep beneath the mucous membrane and lie dormant. Any strenuous activity or stimulation can trigger a relapse. Therefore, the treatment of chronic gonorrhea requires reliable diagnosis and excellent equipment to achieve a radical cure. Modern science is advancing rapidly, and electrotherapy techniques are emerging constantly. The invention of shortwave diathermy machines for treating gonorrhea has proven to be exceptionally effective, surpassing all other treatments. These machines generate intense heat that penetrates deep into the urethral mucosa without damaging tissues, completely eradicating the gonococci. They are truly the only effective tool for treating gonorrhea. As the saying goes, "If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." This is especially true for doctors. The Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital at 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of Shanghai boasts a complete range of electrotherapy equipment for treating gonorrhea. It employs male and female physicians with years of experience, aided by this excellent shortwave diathermy machine. Therefore, patients of all genders who seek treatment receive individualized care, resulting in rapid and complete cures.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Treatment for Indigestion <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— (Physician Chen Xingzhen)</p>
<p>Indigestion occurs when there is a decrease in gastric acid secretion or incomplete gastric motility. This can be caused by anemia or depression in women, or by irregular diet, masturbation, or excessive sexual activity in men. As a result, food is not easily digested, leading to dizziness, mental fog, fatigue, loss of appetite, reduced food intake, a feeling of fullness in the chest, bloating in the stomach, frequent pain, belching, acid reflux, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms. Chinese people are particularly prone to this condition due to irregular eating habits and lack of moderation in diet. Treatment involves avoiding overexertion, engaging in appropriate exercise, practicing moderation in personal habits, and paying attention to food hygiene. After each meal, taking one to two teaspoons of "Wei Bi Ling" (Stomach Essential) can strengthen the stomach, relieve pain, and prevent stomach problems. This medicine is secretly prepared by the Tongren Western Medicine Company at 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai, and is a highly effective remedy for stomach ailments, renowned both domestically and abroad. Each box costs one yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Gonatoden: Highly Effective Treatment for Gonorrhea <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— (Physician Luo Minxiu)</p>
<p>While electrotherapy and injections are essential for treating gonorrhea, self-treatment with oral medication is necessary for those living in rural areas, working in shops, or attending schools due to time and financial constraints. However, there is an abundance of oral medications for gonorrhea, and it is not easy for clinical physicians to test and evaluate each one. This is even more difficult for patients. If one mistakenly purchases inferior medication for self-treatment, it can worsen the symptoms and cause significant harm. Therefore, caution is advised. In my clinical practice, I have recently found an oral medication that is highly effective in treating acute and chronic gonorrhea. This is "Gonatoden," a colored preparation invented by numerous pharmacists and physicians after years of research and experimentation. It possesses the ability to kill bacteria, clear discharge, reduce inflammation, and relieve pain. Its medicinal power can deeply penetrate the submucosal layer of the urethra, eliminating all gonococci residing within and expelling them through urination. This is evident as the urine turns red within one hour of taking the medication. This medicine is exclusively sold by the Shanghai Tongren Western Medicine Company and costs two yuan per box. Mild cases can be cured with two boxes, making it a convenient and effective self-treatment for gonorrhea sufferers.</p>

<p>— (Pharmacist Ma Yin)</p>
<p>Freckles and acne are the most dreaded and easily occurring skin conditions for young men and women. They significantly detract from beauty and elegance. Freckles, in particular, have long been considered incurable. However, with the advent of "Mianli" (Face Beauty), the treatment of both freckles and acne has achieved unprecedented success. This product, when applied to the face, does not irritate the skin, and with continuous application for several days, its effects in removing freckles and acne become apparent. Its effectiveness is so certain that it can be considered the king of beauty products. This product is exclusively sold by the Tongren Western Medicine Company at 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai. The price is one yuan per bottle.</p>

<p>— (Contribution by Gao Jiong)</p>
<p>Several years ago, I suddenly developed ringworm on my legs. Initially, I thought it was a minor skin ailment and did not pay much attention. However, after a few months, it spread to my neck, back, arms, and other parts of my body. At times, I would experience unbearable itching and scratch vigorously, forgetting myself. When the skin broke and bled, the pain was intense. It repeatedly subsided and recurred, becoming thicker with each occurrence. Although I applied various anti-fungal lotions, they only provided temporary relief and never completely cured the condition. Later, a friend introduced me to "Ganlu" (Sweet Dew) lotion, sold by the Tongren Western Medicine Company at 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, which he claimed was the only effective medicine for treating ringworm, eczema, itching, and all skin diseases, and that it cost only one yuan per bottle. I instructed my servant to purchase it at the address and applied it as directed. Immediately, the itching subsided. After applying it for several days, the unsightly condition was completely eliminated. The pain I had endured for years was relieved in a single day, thanks to the effectiveness of "Ganlu" lotion. Therefore, I have taken up my pen to record this and share it with fellow sufferers.</p>
<h3 id="e188">A Word to Those Suffering from Leukorrhea <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— (Female Physician Shen Qinghuai)</p>
<p>Eight or nine out of ten women suffer from leukorrhea (vaginal discharge). In the early stages, treatment is often neglected. Over time, it can lead to lower back pain, dizziness, blurred vision, weakness in the limbs, a sallow complexion, and emaciation. In some cases, leukorrhea is caused by gonorrhea, and the symptoms are similar to those of ordinary leukorrhea. However, the discharge contains gonococci, and urination feels more scalding than with ordinary leukorrhea. This is a warning sign that the condition can damage the body and cause fertility problems. If treatment is not sought promptly, it can lead to uterine disease and pelvic inflammatory disease, which are very dangerous. Therefore, caution is advised. The Wang Yuchu Female Physician Clinic at 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of Shanghai offers two types of medication: "Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and "External Leukorrhea Medicine." These medications are particularly effective and have been proven successful. I often recommend these two medications to patients with leukorrhea because they are mild and effective in treating both leukorrhea mixed with gonococci and simple leukorrhea, suitable for women of all ages, including pregnant women. Each box costs two yuan. Mild cases can be cured with one dose, while more severe cases require only two or three boxes. It is also said that Dr. Wang Yuchu has a high-powered microscope for examining women for gonorrhea at no charge, which is truly a blessing for female patients.</p>

<p>— (Physician She Zhen)</p>
<p>The scourge of opium has plagued China for far too long. Its harm is worse than that of venomous snakes and wild beasts. At best, it harms one's health and ruins the family; at worst, it weakens the race and leads to national subjugation. Given the extent of its harm, how can people still indulge in it without realizing the consequences? Furthermore, in recent years, the government has been very strict about banning opium, so many people are voluntarily seeking medical help to quit. However, during the cessation period, if one does not have the determination to quit and the fortitude to persevere, one will inevitably fail halfway, wasting all efforts. It is therefore crucial to know that even if there is occasional discomfort during the cessation period, the physician should examine the extent of the addiction and assess the severity of the condition, prescribing injections and oral medications to ensure that the person undergoing cessation experiences no pain. The opium toxins will then be gradually eliminated. Fellow sufferers, please take note.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Physician She Zhen is a smoking cessation expert and a savior of those addicted to opium. His cessation methods are refined and reliable, unparalleled by others. He can shorten the cessation period and ensure that those undergoing cessation experience no pain. Therefore, those addicted to opium are happy to follow his methods. Moreover, his fees are low, only two yuan per day. He has recently opened a new sanatorium for the accommodation of those undergoing cessation, providing utmost comfort.</p>

<p>— (Physician Zhou Kechang)</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea refers to the involuntary leakage of semen, often triggered by nightmares during the early morning hours. After the emission, one experiences fatigue, headache, dizziness, heart palpitations, mental distress, and weakness in the legs. In severe cases, it can occur during the day, triggered by imagining lewd things or viewing obscene books and paintings. In even more severe cases, sexual desire gradually decreases, the ability to achieve an erection weakens, and the frequency of spermatorrhea increases, eventually leading to neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion). The causes of spermatorrhea are generally excessive sexual activity, masturbation, and other conditions such as chronic gonorrhea, prostatitis, and cystitis. Therefore, prevention requires strict abstinence from masturbation, moderation in sexual activity, avoidance of physical and mental overexertion, avoidance of alcohol and irritating foods, and the use of light and soft bedding at night. Regular cold water rubs on the genitals are also beneficial. As for medication, "Heierbang" pills are both effective and harmless. I have seen many patients recover after taking this medication.</p>

<p>— (Contribution by Ma Dimin)</p>
<p>In the past, I lived in Yangzhou, where I frequented theaters, teahouses, and brothels. I spent my days indulging in pleasure, unknowingly embarking on a path of depravity. By the time I contracted gonorrhea, it was too late for regrets. I lamented the lack of good doctors in Guangling (Yangzhou) and the absence of Hua Tuo (a famous ancient Chinese physician). I spent money to no avail. So, I came to Shanghai, hoping to find a skilled doctor. I met my friend Zhu Zhenming, who came to visit me and told me that the Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital at 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession employed male and female physicians who specialized in treating venereal diseases, and that the hospital was well-equipped. So, we drove to the hospital for treatment. After a thorough examination by the hospital's physician, I received electrotherapy, injections, and took "Gonatoden" orally. As a result, my symptoms gradually decreased, and in less than three weeks, I fully recovered my original health. The ancient saying "A Yangzhou dream" is a true reflection of my experience.</p>

<p>Severe Stomach Pain</p>
<p>I previously followed your publication's recommendation and purchased "Ganlu" lotion from the Tongren Western Medicine Company to treat ringworm. After using it, I saw immediate results and have fully recovered. I am very grateful. Now, my mother often suffers from severe stomach pain and frequently experiences belching and nausea, resulting in poor appetite and lethargy. I heard that "Wei Bi Ling" (Stomach Essential) powder, sold by the Tongren Western Medicine Company, is also very effective. I would like to know if it is suitable for treating this condition. (Question from Qiu Yifei)</p>
<p>(Answer) "Wei Bi Ling" is an excellent medicine for treating all stomach ailments. Each box costs one yuan. It is very suitable for your mother's condition. You can use it without hesitation.</p>
<p>Suffering from Gonorrhea for Many Years</p>
<p>I contracted gonorrhea several years ago. Although I have sought medical treatment, it repeatedly returns and I have never been completely cured, which I regret greatly. I have long admired your publication's sincerity in advising patients, so I am writing to ask for a recommendation of a good doctor and treatment plan. (Question from Luo Damei)</p>
<p>(Answer) Once gonorrhea becomes chronic, treatment is relatively slower to take effect. The Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital at 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of Shanghai has extensive experience in treating this condition. They use the latest shortwave diathermy and injections, which can resolve both acute and chronic gonorrhea and prevent it from lingering for life.</p>
<p>Treatment for Freckles</p>
<p>My younger sister has freckles on her face. As a woman, she is naturally concerned about her appearance and is very distressed about this. I have also bought medicine for her to treat it, but it has been ineffective. I would like to ask if there is a definitive treatment for freckles. (Question from Shen Minkang)</p>
<p>(Answer) Freckles can certainly be treated. You simply do not know about effective medicine. "Mianli" (Face Beauty), sold by the Tongren Western Medicine Company in this city, is very effective in treating freckles and acne. You can try it. It will not disappoint you. The price is one yuan per bottle.</p>
<p>Wanting to Quit Opium Addiction</p>
<p>My wife has a heart condition. She mistakenly listened to someone's advice and started smoking opium. As a result, she has become emaciated and has difficulty conceiving. I would like to ask if there is a good way to quit. (Question from Wan Baoquan)</p>
<p>(Answer) Quitting opium is not difficult. The key is that the person must be determined to quit and that the person administering the cessation must use effective methods. Physician She Zhen at 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of Shanghai has considerable experience in opium cessation. Those who undergo cessation under his care can safely quit without any pain. His fees are reasonable, and the price for daily injections and oral medication is only two yuan.</p>
<p>Frequent Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>My younger brother's masturbation has led to neurasthenia. He now suffers from frequent spermatorrhea, poor memory, sallow complexion, emaciation, loss of appetite, and a host of other ailments. I would like to ask for advice on treatment. (Question from Geng Linshu)</p>
<p>(Answer) He must stop masturbating and focus on prevention. As for medication, "Heierbang" pills, sold by the Shanghai Tongren Western Medicine Company, are the most suitable and highly effective.

<h3 id="e194">From "Lack of Butter" to "Acquiring New Territory" <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Yin</p>
<p>According to reports, German Economic Minister Schacht recently delivered a speech in which he stated:</p>
<p>"The current scarcity of butter in Germany is a matter of great concern. It should be understood that if our country's exports cannot be increased, then domestic daily necessities cannot be supplied. Our country cannot forever endure this suffering and should be understood by foreign people. The solution lies in increasing domestic production and acquiring new territory where we can obtain the raw materials we need. Therefore, the mere lack of butter is enough to prove the legitimacy of our demands."</p>
<p>At a time when the global economic crisis is intensifying, it is not surprising that imperialists seek to resolve their own crises by obtaining raw material supply bases and new markets. However, after the European War, all the world's colonies have been divided. Germany is a defeated nation, and its former territories have been seized by the victorious powers. Therefore, as the economic crisis worsens, it naturally feels most acutely the lack of foreign markets and raw material supply bases. Schacht's remarks were undoubtedly made for this reason. However, we cannot help but immediately think that if Germany can demand "new territory" for the "lack of butter," then other countries may also demand "new territory" for other deficiencies. But whose territory should be included in whose "new territory"? I think, apart from another massacre, there will probably be no other new tricks.</p>
<p>However, the victims of this conflict will naturally not be any imperialist powers themselves, but rather the weak nations and innocent laborers, because only they will be used as cannon fodder and meat for the slaughter.</p>
<p>On the seventeenth anniversary of the end of the European War, hearing Schacht's remarks could not help but evoke the brutal memories of the European War.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Vegetable Boat <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>The early morning market lay shrouded in the dim light of dawn. Gen Sheng and his wife, however, had already left their warm blankets at the third crow of the morning rooster. Gen Sheng, with a roll of grayish-white canvas in hand, walked towards the riverbank at the stone bridgehead. His wife, carrying a food basket and shouldering an oar, followed Gen Sheng to their old, partially damaged boat. After a brief tidy-up, Gen Sheng jumped ashore and called out to set sail, while she started the fire in the galley to cook breakfast.</p>
<p>The small town was still quiet. Only a blacksmith's shop at the edge of town had an apprentice yawning and lazily removing the dilapidated planks of the door, one by one. Although the doors of a few teahouses were already open, apart from the waiters groaning and puffing as they pumped the bellows to light the stoves, the wooden tables remained silent, showing no sign of the bustling activity that would come in an hour.</p>
<p>"Vegetable boat departing! Vegetable boat to Xishan departing!" Gen Sheng shouted twice through the alleys before returning to the boat to sit at the stern, sipping hot tea and smoking his cheap tobacco, waiting.</p>
<p>At this time, the small barges and cargo ships moored in the river still had their awnings tightly covered, as if no one lived there. The awnings were covered in a layer of frost, as white as if a light snow had fallen overnight. No one could be seen washing clothes on the river wharves either.</p>
<p>The sky gradually brightened, and the thick fog slowly dissipated. The peaks of Huachuan Ridge emerged from the milky white mist.</p>
<p>Soon, vegetable sellers began to arrive, one after another, carrying shoulder poles loaded with various vegetables: local produce, market goods, green vegetables, radishes, taro, scallions, garlic, as well as fish and meat. They rested their loads, lifting them to hand over to Gen Sheng. Gen Sheng's wife also helped to load the baskets and crates into the large central hold until it was full. Then the people hopped aboard, one by one, tossing their carrying poles into the hold. The boat rocked back and forth from the sudden weight, forcing people to hold onto each other to avoid falling into the water!</p>
<p>This small boat had a limited capacity, but now it was loaded with more than ten shoulder-loads of vegetables and over ten people. As a result, the gunwale was only three inches above the waterline. Any lower and water would seep into the hold.</p>
<p>Once everyone was on board, a clamor of voices arose. Some pulled out wrinkled, low-quality cigarettes from their chests, while others hastily used the corner of their skirts to wipe the sweat from their foreheads, which continued to steam as if they had just come out of a steamer. The previously quiet surroundings were now full of life.</p>
<p>"Is everyone here? We should set sail," Zhang Axing asked Gen Sheng, as much a question as a prompt.</p>
<p>"Why hasn't A-Jin come yet? Doesn't he always come?" Gen Sheng's wife remembered how many people usually took the boat. She looked around the passengers and realized one person was missing. After thinking for a moment, she realized it was A-Jin, the dry goods merchant, who hadn't arrived. So, she asked the Two-Headed Monk this question.</p>
<p>"He's not coming. His wife gave birth last night!" the Two-Headed Monk replied in a peculiar tone.</p>
<p>"She gave birth? To what?" This was A-Jin's wife's uncle, so he asked with concern.</p>
<p>"I heard it was a boy! — But the mother is not doing well."</p>
<p>Gen Sheng went ashore to unlock the chain securing the boat to the wild mulberry tree. He returned, stowed the gangplank, and lightly tapped the stone bank with his pole a couple of times, causing the boat to swing into the center of the river. He took his pole and pushed off a few more times. The boat seemed to obey his command, heading towards the river mouth. He stowed the pole, busily stepped over to lower the rudder on the right side, then walked to the stern to help his wife with the oar.</p>
<p>Once they were out of the mouth of the river, they noticed that the southeast wind was quite strong. They released the rudder, raised the grayish-white canvas sail, and let it drift with the wind.</p>
<p>The dozen or so vegetable merchants sat in rows along both sides of the boat's gunwale. Gen Sheng leaned leisurely against the tiller, drinking his liquor.</p>
<p>To the east of Tai Lake, the morning sun gradually emerged from the horizon, like a red egg rolling upward. A gentle breeze blew through the sail, propelling the boat faster.</p>
<p>The towering peak of Dongting Xishan had begun to exhale wisps of white smoke. They knew that the people of Xishan were also cooking breakfast. Then the long bank of Zhenxia Harbor slowly crept past the boat.</p>
<h3 id="e196">A Night in Xuzhou <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>We were travelling on a military vehicle this time, originally expecting to arrive in Xuzhou by noon that day, and then transfer to a train to Bengbu, where we would stay for a day or two. However, before the train even reached Xuzhou, the woods outside the window had merged with the twilight. Naturally, the train to Bengbu had already left, so we had no choice but to spend the night in Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Carrying our simple luggage, we walked along a gravel road and finally settled in a cheap inn. The innkeeper was busy bringing us water, unpacking our bedding, and making tea, while also chattering away, mostly about irrelevant things. After taking care of everything, he smiled ingratiatingly at my friend (who was a military officer) and said:</p>
<p>"Sir, haha, you must be tired after a long day, do you want me to get you a girl?" He deliberately let his awkward laughter cover up the rest of his sentence, naturally giving us a speculative look.</p>
<p>"We'll talk about it later," my friend said, dismissing him, and then turning to me, "There are so many brothels in Xuzhou." He tapped the heel of his riding boot, seemingly very familiar with the place. "There are really too many, because this is where the Longhai and Jinpu railways intersect. Every day, countless soldiers have to come here and leave from here." He was an "Xuzhou expert," having been to Xuzhou seven or eight times before.</p>
<p>I listened curiously as he described everything about the brothels here, and I also recalled the women dressed in flamboyant clothes and covered in perfume that I had seen on the road just now.</p>
<p>"That's right, those are the prostitutes," my friend said. "Many are girls from Jiangbei, with straightforward personalities, but not as lively as those from the South."</p>
<p>My friend was someone who had narrowly escaped death several times, so he was always cold and indifferent, with no sympathy for anything. Naturally, he had also "played" with those so-called "girls" many times.</p>
<p>We were talking animatedly when suddenly someone stopped outside the door. A silhouette appeared on the glass door. Then the door opened gently, and a slender woman walked in.</p>
<p>"Sir, would you like a song?" She lowered her head, absently twisting the handkerchief in her hands, her voice was gloomy and trembling. After a while, she raised her head again, and with a cold! not begging, gaze swept over the two of us, and said softly, "Sir, what song would you like?"</p>
<p>Her face was very pale, and in the dim light of the small inn, her frail face resembled a fading white rose. My friend seemed stunned by her rare demeanor. After a long while, he slowly said, "No, thank you."</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, then withdrew the hand resting on the table and quietly retreated. Her figure was like a ghost in the darkness, and then disappeared outside the door.</p>
<p>My friend had been in the process of taking off his riding boots, but at this moment, he was also a little dazed, muttering to himself absentmindedly, "This girl is a bit strange! This girl is a bit strange!"</p>
<p>"She's probably a girl who's just starting out," he then said to me. "Shy and timid. You can tell from her appearance. Otherwise, I think playing with her would also... Never mind, never mind, let's get up at seven o'clock tomorrow. If you wake up earlier, don't forget to wake me up."</p>
<h3 id="e197">"When the Weather is Good, the Sun Rises" <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Weizhi</p>
<p>Living in these prosperous times, how should one conduct oneself? This question has lingered in my mind for a long time, but I have never been able to decide. Perhaps the reason for my indecision is that I have considered it too thoroughly, feeling that nothing works, and as a result, I cannot help but feel lost.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Xu Xizhen's "clown" attitude of "when the weather is good, the sun rises," which is "attentive to everyone and avoids offending anyone," is an excellent approach, but "after all the talking, the result is still the same as not saying anything." I dare not raise my hand in agreement with this so-called "smoothness" that "results in saying nothing." "Slickness" may be useful as part of a way to deal with the world, but if one is always smooth and "after all the talking, the result is still the same as not saying anything," then without sacrificing one's own principles, there is no way to solve anything.</p>
<p>In fact, even if one is willing to sacrifice one's own principles, it is not necessarily possible to be "attentive to everyone." Let's take an old example: regarding the purpose of art, there were two schools of thought in the past: "art for art's sake" and "art for life's sake." Which of these two is correct? But to be "attentive to everyone" is difficult. If you say "art for art's sake" is correct, then you cannot be "attentive" to those who advocate "art for life's sake," and vice versa. Saying that neither is correct is something one dare not say or even mention. Saying that both are correct is a way to please no one, and the result is still "offending" someone.</p>
<p>Therefore, "when the weather is good, the sun rises; when it rains, the steps get wet" can only become a clown's interjection on stage.</p>
<p>Moreover, the clown's interjections on stage, at most, are just making a funny face to make the ladies and gentlemen in the audience laugh for a while, thinking that he is still sensible and not annoying. There is no better feeling than this. It is not like "upright speech," which, while lengthy and causing headaches, sometimes makes the ladies and gentlemen more difficult to forget.</p>
<p>Of course, the "lengthy speech" of "upright speech" is just that, a "lengthy speech," and does little to help the actual situation. The ones who really get things done are the "warriors" who hold the command arrows, or the "strategists" who, although "unable to truss a chicken," have military force as their backing. However, compared to the "clown," they are sometimes valued much more by the audience, even though the "clown" has the "funny face" that is "attentive to everyone."</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Temple of Great Peace <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>This small town has no wharf for night boats to reach the county seat, and to travel by land, one must detour through the neighboring town. In military terms, it is a strategic location: easy to defend when entering, and easy to attack when leaving. However, in terms of agriculture, it is the most disadvantageous place. Even if the land here is sold at the lowest price, no one dares to risk buying it cheaply. Because the rice produced has to be transported to the county seat by human labor, and the journey is so long that even if one sets out in the morning, one probably won't reach halfway by night. If the villagers refuse to pay the rent, only the landlord will suffer.</p>
<p>For generations, this small town has been populated by independent farmers. As for whether they resisted the landlords or bought the land, it is impossible to determine. This secluded town, like a primitive tribe, is closed off and does not interact with the outside world. However, every spring, the Great Peace Temple on this town raises funds for a community event. The temple is called Great Peace, and the meaning of the event is, of course, to ensure the town's peace for the year. It is said that the Great Peace God is truly responsive to prayers. This town is located higher than the neighboring towns, and as a result, regardless of drought or flood in other towns, this place always has a good harvest. The townspeople say that it is due to the power of the Great Peace God. Therefore, when the community event is held each year, foolish men and women who want to share in the power of the Great Peace God are willing to travel for two days, enduring the hardships of the journey, to participate in this "Great Peace Festival." Moreover, they are respectful and reverent, and before setting out, they must fast and bathe, and abstain from meat for three days. Even married couples must sleep separately on the road. From this, one can see the prestige of the Great Peace Temple in this area.</p>
<p>However, if you go to visit this Great Peace Temple with the grand ambition of a sightseer, you will be greatly disappointed. The temple is a dilapidated house that is about to collapse, without a temple gate. An elderly caretaker lives with the Great Peace God, whose clay has already been exposed. Stepping into the temple, the room where the Great Peace God sits in the center is called the hall. Looking up, you can see the sky through several places in the roof beams. And all the accessories belonging to the temple, such as the bailiffs, the "avoidance" and "silence" signs, are all missing. Only the Great Peace God sits in the center (because the central roof beam is intact, otherwise, I think they would have asked him to move to a corner of the room covered in cobwebs). In front of him is a half-table with one leg missing, and a censer. Besides that, there is only the caretaker, crouching at the feet of the Great Peace God like a hungry dog.</p>
<p>When the community event is held, the Great Peace God is clamped to two thick bamboo poles, and two strong farmers run along the entire town as if they are stealing him from the temple. Visitors who have come from afar to share in the power of the Great Peace God also sprint after them, which is called "chasing Great Peace." The caretaker's livelihood depends on the "chasing Great Peace" ritual each year, because the incense money is quite substantial.</p>
<p>The Great Peace God and the caretaker enjoy this Great Peace broth every year, until a war breaks out. When the troops occupy the town, this deity and the Great Peace Temple are destroyed by artillery fire. When the town's farmers return after the war, only the elderly caretaker is missing. It is feared that he also sacrificed himself for the Great Peace God, with whom he depended on for life.</p>
<p>Now there is not a trace of the Great Peace Temple in this town. The boundless rice fields, in these years when various provinces and counties are suffering from severe floods and droughts, the town still has a good harvest every year. Naturally, the power of the Great Peace God has faded from their memories. However, when neighboring towns suffer disasters, they say it is because they have not rebuilt the Great Peace Temple.</p>

<p>A Scene of Utter Desolation</p>
<p>Society is so licentious, people's hearts are so decadent, look up, a scene of utter desolation! The room is filled with color, the room is filled with the aroma of meat, how many young people are buried!</p>
<p>Having hands but not working is like having no hands; demon palace! My husband, buried alive by you! Having legs but not striving upwards is like having no legs; my husband, buried alive by you! Neon lights, dazzling and brilliant, anesthetized his heart; the fragrance of wine, the aroma of flesh, blinded his ambition; lost, all hope; brought back, a heavy burden of resentment and remorse; look up, a scene of utter desolation, lower your head, a desolate landscape everywhere.</p>
<p>Having a brain but not thinking is like having no brain; without a brain, like a cripple, everything becomes hopeless! Having strength but not working is like being crippled and paralyzed; only enjoying pleasure! Cannot last long, a lifetime of only sorrow! Love songs echoing, seductive tunes melodious, covering his thoughts; the flying eyebrows, the unrestrained colors, buried his strength; young people! The country is in great difficulty; this is not a time for singing and dancing! Young people! Open your eyes and take a look, a scene of utter desolation!</p>

<h3 id="e204">"Hero of the Times" is a Problem Play <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>...Deserves Attention</p>
<p>The entire period experienced by the play "Hero of the Times" occupies two major records in world history:</p>
<p>1.  World War I.</p>
<p>2.  The world-shaking storm of aggression.</p>
<p>Of course, many heroes can be created in the dynamic of these two major records; however, the play depicts not heroes on the battlefield, but heroes in the business world. The entire play begins by writing about how this hero succeeds due to the times, and continues to write until this hero fails due to the times.</p>
<p>Continued on Page 3</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>"The stage is a weapon" (StageIs 00h). This is a metaphor used by people in other countries who value drama. Then, those who are working hard in drama, holding this weapon, should study how to use this weapon well. The purpose of using this weapon well is to ensure that the performance of drama can provide guidance to the masses and benefit society and the country. We made "Hero of the Times" and "Triumphant Song" with the above goals in mind.</p>
<p>The collapse of China's rural areas and the decline of industry and commerce have become undeniable facts. This is a major economic problem in China, and also a major problem for the survival of the Chinese nation. If there is no way to solve this major problem, even if China can escape death from the oppression of cannon fire and iron hooves, it will inevitably die from economic oppression.</p>
<p>"Hero of the Times" is a problem play belonging to the industrial and commercial sector. This problem play contains two reasons: The first reason is to show the result of national capital being oppressed by international capital. The second reason is to show the suicide of the invisible internal war in the psychology of the Chinese people. —Huideng Bank oppresses Zhenxing Yarn Factory, Sun Zhonggui oppresses Zhao Dexiong.</p>
<p>The reasons included in the problem of why China's industry and commerce are declining are, of course, very complicated. It is definitely not just the two reasons played out in the drama "Hero of the Times". However, to save industry and commerce, and to revive industry and commerce, all kinds of reasons must be solved in every way. We held onto the above two reasons and made the problem play "Hero of the Times," hoping to use this problem play to stimulate the masses in order to seek answers in the public's psychology.</p>
<p>Now we want to make further efforts to solicit opinions on solving the problem as material for making the sequel to "Hero of the Times." We sincerely hope that the industrial and commercial sectors, the education sector, and the intellectual class who have suffered pain are willing to generously give us their opinions, and especially hope to have scripts that can solve problems and encourage self-awareness. So that we can use the weapon that is bigger than the stage to benefit the country and society.</p>
<p>We should understand that the initial control of the world's population and all rights belonged to military force, then to culture, and now to economics. If we only shout the slogans of collapse or decline for defense against aggression and the construction of productive bases – industry and commerce – without giving instructions to awaken self-awareness and encourage competition, and sit idly by and watch them be destroyed again, this is driving the people in the bases to do the tragic work of suicide for themselves, for their careers, and for their country.</p>
<p>The realization of this kind of tragic fact is, of course, something that everyone is unwilling to see, and even more unwilling to let this tragic fact become a factor in changing the map, sitting idly by as the country falls into a state worse than India and Korea.</p>
<p>We hope that our calls can gain the sympathy of an audience that goes beyond entertainment, and gain more of the sympathy of audiences who express their opinions to us.</p>
<h3 id="e205">About "Boat Girl" <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>"Boat Girl," written and directed by Shen Xiling, depicts the tragedy and comedy of the women's liberation movement. It has the charm of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" and the meaning of improving society. It is a worthy masterpiece that deserves attention. It has now been sent to Beijing for review, and will be available to the audience as soon as it is approved.</p>
<p>In "Boat Girl," written and directed by Shen Xiling, he introduced the beauty of West Lake from the most beautiful angle and with the most artistic perspective, opening the eyes. The ripples in West Lake, the hazy willows, the six bridges and three temples, the Su Causeway and Broken Bridge, the scenic spots in the lake, combined with the joys and sorrows of human life, are truly a lyrical poem and a sketch painting.</p>
<p>"Boat Girl" is the first collaboration between Lao Gao and Xu Lai. Lao Gao plays the weaver Tie Er, and Xu plays the boat girl A Ling. It can be said that the personalities of these two characters could not be more suitable for Lao Gao and Xu Lai. You see them laughing, sighing, and silently shedding tears on the screen, and you will unconsciously laugh and cry with them, as if the characters on the screen are you yourself. Their expressions in "Boat Girl" have simply reached a state of selflessness. Especially Xu Lai, "She has never done such a good play!" That's what people who have seen the test screenings said.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Joint Film News <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Since its merger with Twentieth Century Company, Fox Film Corporation has become even more powerful. Their film "Bachelor Bait" is currently showing at the Grand Theater, and "Dressed to Thrill," starring the famous European and American actress Dorothy Lamour and Clive Brook, will be released at the Cathay Theater starting today (Thursday). This is a witty and interesting romance that tells the story of a man who simultaneously falls in love with a modest young woman and a theater star, only to discover that they are one and the same person, leading to a series of amusing incidents.</p>
<p>The first day of the screening of "Bachelor Bait" at the Grand Theater was completely sold out. The sole reason for this is due to the technological advancements in the film itself, completed with sound and better photography. Compared to the era of silent films a decade ago, it naturally has more appealing qualities. However, it is said that because Paramount's musical extravaganza "Hollywood Party" has already been scheduled to be screened from tomorrow (Friday), "Bachelor Bait" can only be shown until today. Friends who love such moral tragedies should not miss this last opportunity.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. spared no effort in producing Shakespeare's famous play "A Midsummer Night's Dream," a prestigious work by the authoritative stage director Max Reinhardt, who joined the film industry for the first time. Movie fans have long yearned for this film. Now, there is excellent news to report to readers: this film will be presented at the Cathay Theater within the month. It is said that when this film was shown in New York, the ticket price was as high as eleven US dollars, and the crowded attendance still broke records. Therefore, when the Cathay Theater screens this film, it may also slightly increase the ticket price.</p>
