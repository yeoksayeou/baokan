<p>— 恒</p>
<p>英國派遣艾登赴意調解意阿爭端。今已爲第二次上次。調解之結果。卽意阿兩國依照一九二八年之友好條約組織仲裁委員會。解抉爭端。期於本年八月二十五日完成解决方案。過此若無成議。則由國聯行政院辦理。唯自艾登返英之後。墨索里尼一面繼續增兵東菲。一面屢發不容第三者干涉之言論。同時意國各報亦一致對英攻擊。觀於意國朝野此種激昂慷慨之情緒。可知意國根本不欲放棄圖阿之雄心。其所以暫時接受艾登之調解辦法者。蓋在敷衍英國之面子耳。今者英德海約成立。英法意對德之陣綫顯生裂痕。意國對英殆不勝其憤慨。英國於此求意之諒解。猶恐不及。乃欲再度調解意阿之爭端。其事之難。自必更甚於艾登上次羅馬之行也。</p>
<p>英國調解意阿爭端。其最感困難者。卽國聯之威信問題。蓋阿比西尼亞雖爲非洲之國家。究亦國聯中之一員。按照會章。其他會員國固不得侵犯其土地之完整與主權之獨立也。且英國歷次對意之干涉。亦嘗以維持國聯威信爲言。今何能以示好於意人之故遽行自壞其立塲。故依此一端而觀英人縱欲對意讓步。恐不能不出以不損國聯威信之辦法。藉滿意大利之欲望。據最近電訊。艾登所提調解辦法。係准由意國建造鐵道。通過阿比西尼亞領土。以使意屬索謀里倫與愛里德里兩地互相聯結。對於阿比西尼亞則由英國許其使用英屬索謀里倫通至紅海之各海口以作報酬。此誠顧全意阿雙方面子。同時不使國聯陷於絕地之一種辦法。惟墨索里尼則堅持澈底變更阿國政制之主張。對於上項調解辦法已予拒絕。是則英國爲取得意人之好感。貫澈其安定歐局之目的計。殆不得不將阿比西尼亞問題。重加考慮矣。</p>

<p>本屆大會球類比賽秩序編配之合宜、與各項球類錦標第二第三請四第名位、頗有關係、自應集全體委員之意見、妥爲分配、庶能集思廣益、藉免萬一之遺誤、茲擬原則數項提請討論、使本股將來工作得有依據、不虞隕越、</p>
<p>（一）淸各委員依據個人意見、於各項球類錦標中、每項選定成績最優之單位八個、於九月十日前、按理想之次序、列表簽字蓋章、寄交本股、（該表由會印發）</p>
<p>（二）由本股歸納各委員選定結果、將票數最多之八個單位提出、作種子法之準備、</p>
<p>（三）在此八個單位中、再擇較多票數之四單位、分別抽籤安挿於上下部四段中、而以其餘四單位、用同樣方法抽排於不同之各段內、（以上三條、或由競賽委員會推定五小組、每小組委員七人主持之、亦無不可、）</p>
<p>（四）如有票數相等之單位、以各委員所立理想之次序中之先後、作分別階段之標準、</p>
<p>（五）依上法則理想中得半複賽權者、巳完全排列妥當、不致在初次賽中相遇、於是將其餘各單位、用抽籤法安挿、於全部秩序之空位中、</p>
<p>（六）網球比賽秩序、單位每一單位在上下兩部中各行安挿一人、以抽籤法决定之、單打之上下兩部及雙打之分配方法、完全相同、</p>
<p>（七）如有特殊情形、隨時提出本委員會共同商决之、</p>

<p>— （謝仲文）</p>
<p>堅持和拘泥，變通和浮滑，其間本有不可逾越的界限，但人們往往誤堅持爲拘泥，誤變通爲浮滑，於是世界上充滿著「刻舟求劍」的頑固派和「隨波逐流」的浮滑派。這兩派互相　罵，互相攻擊，所持的武器，前者的是盤古開天地時所用的石斧——「堅持」，後者的是孫悟空大鬧水晶宮時所得的金箍棒——「變通」。他們的攻擊，幾乎下下都打中了敵方的要害，於</p>
<p>其實堅持並不是拘泥，只有單懂得堅持而不懂得變通的人才會拘泥；變通也不是浮滑，只有單懂得變通而不懂得堅持的人才會浮滑。堅持應該是在一一定一時空條伴之下的不屈不撓的幹法，變通卻是在時空條件「轉換」時的應付法。不理解客觀環境的需要，而濫用堅持或變通，那結果所得的定是拘泥或浮滑。</p>
<p>堅持之中要有變通，變通之中亦要有堅持。堅持與變通，同是成功不可少的方法。</p>

<p>縞衣搖曳綠波中，不染些兒泥垢。玉去亭亭飄白羽，同占人間未有。兩小无猜，雙飛不倦，好是忘年友。粉靨香腮，天然生就佳耦。但覺萬種柔情，一般純潔，艷福容消受。軟輕語嬌顰沈醉裏，甜蜜光陰何驟！縱與長期，年年如此，也苦時非久。一生花下，朝朝莫莫相守。昨閱董綬經（康）老所著書舶庸譚」，復多綺什記留。茲摘錄其「攝影寄玉姬」一詩，以見豹之一斑；抱恨長拚刖此生，未删綺業與閑情。香山一事應輸我，垂老翻留薄倖名。蝸壁籠紗覓舊題。已灰壯志厭聞鷄。臂鬟時繞覊人夢，聊借鳧西作世西。</p>

<h3 id="c204">上海主婦的消遣問題 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>上海，每一個家庭中，每一個經濟情形，够得上水平綫的家庭中，至少總雇着一個老媽子的。一切洒掃揩抹洗滌的井臼之勞，都由老媽子担任。於是做主婦的所負担的工作，便不過是替丈夫生男育女而巳。（兒女旣經生育之後，乳哺撫抱之責，普通是都由乳媼承值的）。若是肯在中午時份，上廚房去掌着菜刀做菜的，已算是十分勤儉的了。</p>
<p>因此，上海人家的主婦的消遺問題，我覺得不能不算是不怎麽容易解决的，因爲一天二十四小時之中，至少總有十小時以上的時間，是閒着的。</p>
<p>以我所冷眼觀察而得的一般主婦的消遣法，最普通的，自然是合着四個人，不拘是對門三好婆，隔壁寗波阿姨，甚而至於在三缺一時，到弄底去拉來的蹺脚阿二湊搭子，抹上十二圈，或是十六圈。若是眞合不成局呢，那麽，光陰也妃不肯虛度的，得拉了廂房間裏的王家嫂嫂，或是亭子樓裏的張家姆媽，去瞧一下子電影，或上書場去聽一回子書，若是今天恰巧偏偏沒有好片子，或是不高興出門，那麽，沒有辦法，只得上鄰居家去，和別一位主婦談天，從丈夫的慳吝，談到旗袍的長短問題，一直談到某嫂嫂的短處相隱事。若是連這也不高興，那麽，開着收音機、呼着香烟，聽幾句潮流滑稽，也可以解些無聊。若嫌這還是乏味那麽，倒在沙發裏睡一會，養足精神，以便在晚上跟着丈夫出去玩要，或是和丈夫爭吵。</p>
<p>每天，主婦是這麽忙忙碌碌着，無怪乎每一位主婦，總是嚷着「累死我了」。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十五回　苦口婆心不平空拍案錢聲燈影可憐正賣人</p>
<p>胡嫂子這就睞了眼睛一笑道：老早要說你老爺，你又不要。現在你老爺又想了。志前連連搖着頭笑道：不不不，不是那麽回事。我們　到說，有人要抱這姑娘買了去。對於他的祖母和他的母親，並不養活，讓他們骨肉分離，是有這件事嗎？胡嫂子道：還不是那賈老爺出的主意嗎！他說，姑娘他是要的討去作姨太太，爲的是自己好開心。這兩個年紀大的女人，他要去有什麼用？所以他只肯出一百五十塊錢把這姑娘買去。北海是坐在靠墻一張茶儿邊的，聽了這話，立刻舉起拳頭，在茶几上搥了一下，卜冬一聲，根上面一個茶杯震得跌落地上，倒　了粉砟。嚇得胡嫂子哎呀連聲，不敢再說。茶房捧了燈進來，也就連問怎麽了。志前笑道：並沒有什麽事，屋子裏有點暗，這王先生把茶几撞翻了。北海到了事後，才覺得自己有魯莽，也就不再說什麽了。志前道：這樣大一個姑娘，人又很好，一百五十塊錢就賣了，未免太便宜。說起來，總也是你一個外甥女。你那出嫁的妣姐，就只有這一點骨肉，上面還有一個白髮老婆婆，也無非望着這姑娘作一條生路，死了呢，也靠這姑娘抓一抱土埋起來。若是照你這樣子打算，一百五十十塊錢，就把他們活割了，這兩個寡婦女人將來靠誰？這姑娘跟了姓賈的到江南去，也不知是怎樣結果。他舉目無親，受了屈，也沒有地方找人作　。說重一點，這一百五十塊錢，恐怕是一條人命。人生在世，那裏不好積德，而況這還是你的至親骨肉。（二五一）</p>

<p>太后便回過頭來，向他看着，很燥急地說道：</p>
<p>「快些去召幾個在太翳院當差的人進來！」</p>
<p>實際上，李蓮英一知道伊老人家的身子有些不快，早就自動的打發人去把那些御醫們召進來了。在那個時候，朝中也像歷代一般的設着一個太醫院；主特的是院使，是位一二品的大官。院使之下，有院判和御醫等；他們的官階也有好幾級，那些高級的簡直不在我父親之下。他們雖然一般也是讀醫書，論脈案的醫生，可是他們却和外面的醫生大有不同，因爲他們還有一肚皮侍候皇差的專門學識咧！他們旣然都是做着很高的大官，自然也有很完備的公服；紅圍帽，珊瑚頂，（刻花的）運着一枝孔雀毛的翖子，和一件十分美麗的朝衣。我自進大內以來，各色的人物差不多已全見到了：惟有這些御醫，竟沒有機會見面。因此我也急着的要見，還要瞧太后怎樣的讓他們給伊診病。我此時不由深深地暗喜起來，多虧太后特別的想到了我，把我從不上值的時候召了來，才使我得以恭逢其盛。</p>
<p>因爲李蓮英已早就把這些御醫召來的緣故，所以太后的旨意才下去，不到二四分鐘，就有四位太翳院的老爺，魚貫着走進來了。太后是斜靠在一個比較最低的御座上，依舊不住在咳嗽，但體態還是很莊嚴，絲毫不移動地接受着這四位御醫的朝參。本來尋常人診病，醫生們第一步總得先瞧一瞧病人的容色；然而這四位御警那裏敢向太后平視呢？他們是始終不敢抬起頭來的。（三五一）</p>

<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>不怎麼在外面有交際的我，居然承朋友的不棄，這回子，給了我一份請柬，上面寫着一敬請於月之×日，下午六時，駕臨××酒樓一叙」。</p>
<p>我時常見報上有人在罵中國人的不守時刻的惡習，怕挨人罵，所以趕得很早去。在江海關大鐘上，指着五點五十五分鐘時，便趕上了某酒樓。</p>
<p>在酒樓的門口，便見到「樓廳王先生請客」七個白粉大字，寫在紅底的玻璃框子裏。於是我便大踏步的跨進去。侍者露着驚奇的目光，把我領上了樓廳。樓廳裏雖已安放着六個圓桌，桌子上面，安着盃筷，水果，冷盆，但冷淸淸的找不到一個人影。</p>
<p>「王先生呢」？我禁不住的嬰。</p>
<p>「王先生每次請客，總得近七點鐘才來」。侍者答着，招呼我揩面，抽姻，喝茶，坐着。</p>
<p>抽完一支姻，六點一刻了，主人還沒來，客也沒一個。於是又燃上一支姻，抽着。一直守到六點五十分，王先生才忽忽地來了，不住的拱着手說「累等，累等。」但是我只得搶着說「才到，才到。」</p>
<p>七點半了，客才到了近四十位，離着六桌人還遠咧，但是我已是飢腸轆轆，眼前不住的火星直迸，恨不得逃出去買幾個生煎饅頭，果一下子腹。</p>
<p>近八點鐘了，又陸續的來了十幾位。於是王先生開言了，說「我們先坐起來罷。」</p>
<p>我如奉綸音，正想坐席，說時遲，那時快，旁座的一位便搶着說，「早咧，早咧，楊錦老，徐伯老，胡慰老還都沒到呢，再等一會也不遲。」</p>
<p>於是大家又平心靜氣的等着，等着，等到八點二十分，才到齊了入席，可是我早已餓得手脚冰冷了。</p>

<p>涉獵風景，凡視綫所及，一覽無　者，斯爲下乘，俗諺謂之推門見山也。取景，猶行文然，貴有含蓄，血耐人咀嚼，始可以言雋品。佈置園林，止限於數弓之地，而欲見其龐大，目之所接者，水竹淸華，崗嵐起伏，路轉峯迴，幽徑可通，固是匪易。昔者高遯隱逸之士，往往以畢生心血，經營一園，其聞一邱一壑，　不審度形勢，考核位置，而後從容著手，雖人之精力有限，　胸羅詩書，决不至淪爲俗道，後人遊覽之餘，尙能體其辛苦，徘徊而不忍遽去。挽近顯官大賈，競慕風雅，新興園林，指不勝届，敷設急進，蹴可幾，游者第覺其黃金氣息，充賽四周，雖同一草木，同一池石，位置無雜，傖俗莫名。於以見昔人規劃數十年，終其身以赴之者，自有其獨到處矣。</p>
<p>偶遊漕涇冠生園晨塲，雖創闢未久，而已陳設楚楚，洗君於運籌之餘，鑒於滬地　囂，經營斯區，亦所以供顧客作休沐盤桓招凉逭署之需。園基佔地四十畝，四野平曠，田疇一碧，範籬作界，新經如砥，園右廠屋旣成，高可吻大，相隔一水，藉資聯絡，園內包羅萬有，分苗圃，花房，菊畦，梅林，蜂塲，羊圈，錦鷄塢，金魚集，屋有綠蔭草堂，望梅軒，梅竹居，飲冰室，素菜棚，梅亭，茅舍，等。一以樸雅是尙，取景亦殊幽蓓。望雲橋畔，矮山如虎踞，一枝柳間一枝桃，足資登眺。月洞門側，有寫眞亭。其右，列各式玻璃盆盞，搜集水族綦富，龍魚一種種產自百粵，形似　而較小，墨鱗間赤，狀殊威猛，聞得之頗難，此物產生水中，長不過　寸，一旦登陸，長大無倫，由問發掘　骨，卽其遺蛻云。草堂琴桌，供石妙　一事，玲瓏剔透，碧苔滋生，補壁題詠詩畫，參酌古今。全園之妙，純以織巧取勝，雖一草一木，都經細心考慮，有條不紊，法君能採納　言，責成專家設計，故雖着墨不多，恰似一福倪迂山水也。</p>

<h3 id="c223">小說叢話論略（一） <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>光緒二十九年（一九〇六），梁啓超剏「新小說」於日本，特闢小說叢話二欄，是蓋爲中國小說有「叢話」之始。當時撰稿者，凡十數人·梁啟超·狄平子，吳研人，均各有所作，最初一期，啓超並爲之引，指此「爲中國前此未有之作。」</p>
<p>啓超論小說，不乏卓見，其最重要者，在指出文學進化之大關鍵，「郎由古語之文學，變爲俗語之文學」，和小說「抉非以古語之文體而能工，」以及小說與羣治之關係，所謂「欲改良羣治，必自小說易革命始，欲新民自必新小說始」（論小說與羣治之關係）。其論書於「桃花扇」發抒獨多，至尊之爲民族主義條件。另一條中，又說及晚淸以新觀點論小說之文學，以嚴幾道與別士（不知是夏蕙卿否？）之萬餘言的天津國聞報「附印小說緣起」爲最早，惜此文今已無法得一見。</p>
<p>其次爲平子，其論小說甚至以之與經傳並列，說「與經傳有互相輔助之功用」，可以「移易人心，改良社會」，影響所及，不止於「婦女與粗人」（夏蕙卿語）。說，孔子當日之刪詩，卽是改良小說，改良歌曲，卽是改良社會」，可以「詩爲小說之祖，孔子爲小說家之祖」。他以爲「欲改良社會，必先改良歌曲，改良歌曲，必先改良小說」。於書有「金瓶梅」「水滸傳」合論，以社會生活考察的態度作論點，頗有是處，在當時可謂極大胆新奇之議論。有彈詞小說論。有「聊齋」論，稱之爲民族主義作品，說原本攻擊滿人之處頗多，刋印時被刪去。而論「紅樓夢」獨多，謂爲「憤滿」之作。綜其議論，長處不少，缺點則在不能客觀。</p>
<p>俠人不知爲誰，爲「紅樓夢」作一長辯，辯其非淫書，實爲一極有價值之社會小說，政治小說，倫理小說，哲學小說，道德小說，並作事實之引伸。其結論是，「紅樓夢」一書，實係「以大哲學家之眼識，摧陷廓淸舊道德」，攻擊「舊社會」及黑暗政治之作。以曹雪芹與龔定菴並論，稱爲「近百年來兩大思想家」。所論雖是，終難免誇大之嫌。</p>
<p>定一所作，論「水滸」最詳，其持論亦最激。謂此書是「獨立自强而倡民主民權之萌芽」，說施耐菴之作此，實有二種主義，一爲「民主民權」，其另一則是：「因外族闖入中原，痛切陸沉之禍」，作此以「鼓吹武德，提振俠風，以爲排外之起點」。此種議論，亦不免於主觀的空想之病，但頗足代表當時小說論中之最普遍的傾向。</p>
<p>浴血生·曼殊，亦有佳作，因無特色，故從略。吳趼人所作，有四條，合入「月月小說」「說小說」（一九〇六）裏並論。「新小說」共刋行兩年，「小說叢話」，幾於無期無之，一月月小說」則偶而揭載，顧其論小說，祇有吳趼人所作，有可取處。</p>
<p>知新室主周桂笙與陶報癖所作，多係批評當時新作與翻譯。如周之「評胡實玉」，陶之「評新石頭記」，「恨海」，雖亦有是處，總不免誇大及替朋友（吳趼人」捧塲之病，實不如「小說叢話」遠甚。</p>
<p>其最好的，是在「說小說」之外的幾篇小說論。如天僇生，其「論小說與改良社會之關係」，「中國歷代小說史論」，「中國三大小說家論費」，「劇塲之敎育」諸篇，或述中國小說史的發展，或說小說產生的社會報稱，或對作家有所論列，或主張改良舊劇，思想主張都表示着是當時一種最進步的。</p>
<p>又有「月月小說叢刊詞」一篇，爲陸亮成作，洋洋數千言，直是一篇出色的中國小說史。從上古說到近代，涉及的小說不下數百種，且附論評，見解亦相當進步。在當時論小說諸作中，殆祇有黃唐西「小說小話」之舊小說回憶一節，可以與之並論。足以與「小說叢話」相頡頑者，有賴乎此。但不知此天僇生與陸亮成果否眞有其人也？</p>
<h3 id="c224">萌芽五十年 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 立波</p>
<p>左拉在一八八四　五年寫成的一萌芽一，巳經有了五十年被人熱烈捧讀的光榮的生命，聽說，法國的出版界，今年舉行了牠誕生的五十年紀念。</p>
<p>這紀念，是值得我們饗應的。</p>
<p>我們知道，萌芽一是用了藝術家的科學的睿智作成的工人苦况的最初的小說。牠是最忠實的反映了世紀末的歐洲工人的境况，留下了初期運動的一切特微的藝術記錄。牠是職工，因此這本書從出版到現在，牠一直是爲人們愛讀的書，這並不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>開始寫「萌芽」以前，作者在北部法蘭西和比利時的炭坑裏住了六個月，和工人們一同呼吸含着使人窒息的瓦斯的空氣，懂得了他們的內和外的生活細節。他的書裏的工人的日常生活，炭坑崩裂的慘劇等等的描寫，差不多都建築在　實之上，可是又滲雜着工人的內在的感情，這樣，構成了叙事詩的崇高的情調。</p>
<p>拿一萌芽，和處理同一主題的辛克萊的一石炭王相比，更　以看出前者的不可及的崇高。「石炭王的思想是外來的，主人公是遊戲的公子。」萌芽　的主人公Eticnne是最急進的　年工人。</p>
<p>Etienne的確是一個典型的職工領袖，他有無限的活力，求知的野心，愛同伴的深厚的情感。他得着一切礦工的信賴。可是，初出塲的時候，他也帶着靑年的輕跺，他相信正義的實現，不過是幾個月的事；相信在一個長吻之後，全人類的幸福可以到臨。</p>
<p>隨着砍事的事實的展開，左拉也開展了一切人物的心理的進步，這是「萌芽」的精髓所在，是牠的不朽的特點之一。　實是含着最豐富的敎育的意義的，左拉懂得去醫治他的人物的心即的毛病，去糾疋他們的宿命　的錯誤。</p>
<p>在離開炭坑的時，Eiienne充滿了希望，在這新生的季節的歡欣裏，他左右環視。他　始想到他自己，通過炭坑的難堪的，辛苦的經騐，他感到了强壯，「他的敎育完成了，」他要像前進運動中的一個受了訓練的兵士一樣，全副武裝，走向前去。他聽到了靈鵲的歌聲，看到被正義的大火照耀着的世紀末的黎明的顏色不久，一四月的太陽升到了天空，放射着他的一切光輝，溫暖着這懷孕的大地。從她的滋育的懷裏，生命重新迸發出來了，小蕾變成了碧業，田野搖蕩着發芽的草。種子在光與熱的迫求中，到處澎漲，壯大，突破了大地。……人們茁　了，起來了，要求着下一個世紀的收獲，而不久，那萌芽就要　破這大　。</p>
<p>這樣動人的叙事般的豫言，實　激起人的情感的。「萌芽」的偉大處也許就在這兒吧！</p>

<p>— 歐陽凡海</p>
<p>——你還有這　多力氣能够罵人麽？</p>
<p>——不罵？這些天誅地滅的快活！嘿！吃我的鷄！</p>
<p>……算了吧，……你歇一歇</p>
<p>那老婦人就在他的面前坐下。</p>
<p>——春天快完了！我們眞老得快呷，四嫂！</p>
<p>——哼……你倒還威風（健康）！望你老人家好呵！</p>
<p>——你不要罵了……到老還爭什麽呢？我現在什麽也不在乎些，只覺得我們的日子過得太快了，老得太快了！我一想到後生（年輕）時候就差不多要哭！</p>
<p>——越想越傷心！我的鷄巳經養了三年了。</p>
<p>——你不想一想我們從前的日子麽？</p>
<p>——我們眞是應該想一想的呷，我想起我從前做小姑娘的時候……可是我的鷄呢？</p>
<p>——是的，你也沒有忘記吧！我們不是說……到這裏。—他的話被一陣春天的煦風吹縮住了。田野間的香氣吹到他鼻子裏，但靑靑的山，綠茸茸的原野，散落在高高低低的刺叢中的小花和金色的太陽，一切春天的景色都只映了一片金灰色的漠糊不淸的印象在他的老腦膜上。他的那隻化紅了的眼睛裏不斷地流着水，他用力地聚精會神，才看得見在他的脚下拖去一條白輝輝的小石路。他的談話的對手，那被他呌作四嫂的是一個七十四歲，然而還健康的瘦得像柴根一樣的老婦人。她坐在他對面的一個天燈柱底下的石墩上。這個村口子上天燈柱下的石墩，她曾經在那上面坐下去一個自己的屁股印，沒有人知道她曾在那上面坐過多少回的。並且，天燈柱下的這個石墩，是他們倆永遠忘記不了的紀念。男的這老人巳六十六歲，他用力睜着眼睛，用刀揩去眼睛裏流出來的水，好像渴望着要看一看對面這七十四的老婦人。他微笑着，笑得滿面是皺紋了，而他那高闊的額角上仍然閃爍着他年靑時代的聰明。他的口笑得微顫了，唇皮輕輕地動着表現出他完全在沉醉一種甜密的回憶裏，而這種回憶的本身顯然是痛苦的，因而使他十分難堪了似的。</p>
<p>——你的眼睛一點也看不見了麽？</p>
<p>——差不多是什麽也看不覓了。我眞想看一看你的面，四嫂！我只能看見你的面是一片黃泛泛的，看不淸營你的鼻子和口和眼！我眞恨，啊！我如果能再看一看你的面，我該是多少快活！</p>
<p>——我希望你不要看見我的面！</p>
<p>——爲什麽？</p>
<p>——我已經老了，老得不成樣子了。你如果能看見我的面，那有什麼好處呢？</p>
<p>——不看見你的面有什麼　處？</p>
<p>——你不是可以想像我前幾年的面。那時比現在好得多！這幾年來我突然老了，你如果看見我現在的面，那就是年輕時我在你腦中的美麗的印象也要逃個精光了。</p>
<p>——哼！四……他似乎想要抗議的樣子。可是他老想不出理由來回答，雖然他已聽見四嫂說過這話不知幾百回了。</p>
<p>——眞的。你這老賊頭！你沒看見我的鷄麽？</p>
<p>——沒有，四嫂，我怎麽看得見呢？我眞是想到從前呢！你忘記了麼？有一回……</p>
<p>——誰記得這許多！你眞是老不死呢？我問你，我的鷄呢？</p>
<p>——誰管你的鷄！</p>
<p>——天哪！我就是這一隻鷄了！我的屋子漏得快要倒塌了，我今天就應該先把我的鷄失去麽？</p>
<p>——一定又是戲班子裏捉去吃了。四嫂！我們眞是老得快呀！你呢，你還有個孫女，我已經六十六了，我永遠是個光棍呢——這老單身漢是一個生性聰明過人，然而是賭着嫖着，豪俠而多情地過了一生世的。他仲出兩隻如同枯柴一樣生着壳的手幹，摸向前去，顯然是想摸一摸四嫂的手。四嫂把手裏的菜刀凑到他手上去，他的手碰到那冰冷的鐵，像一隻貓爪仲向前去觸到火熖一樣縮了回來。</p>
<p>——呵！四嫂……</p>
<p>——你眞老不死呵！</p>
<p>於是這一個在十幾年先，當她五十左右時，她還能以她的美貌與全村上下的年輕女郎爭過豐艷的老婦人把菜刀收回去放在「刀正板」（切菜用的板）上，然後把她另一隻手裏的香挿在石墩的泥縫裏，便伸手過去和那老頭子的手緊緊地握着了。天燈柱的日影壓在他倆的身上，春風掠起男人那禿—的僅有的幾根白髮，女人的破衣褂也被風吹動着。田野的西角裏吹來農人叱牛的聲音，而這兩個老人，呼吸十分沉重，彷彿相互壓着一想。</p>
<p>過了好一會，他們倆放開了手，女人馬上就開始說。</p>
<p>—我的兒子如果沒有死，我不怕那些爛喉嚨的戲子不交還我的鷄！</p>
<p>你爲什麼只是說鷄？</p>
<p>—你呌我說行麽，老　死？難道說這麼上了年紀還要說心阡肉麻不成？</p>
<p>—你不記得麽？在你二十歲時，我還只十九歲，那一晚……我們不也在這天燈柱下……</p>
<p>—你老是想這些鬼事麽？你眞是人老心不老，我的天！我是想另一件事，我是想我的兒子從前帶班子做戲，從來不偷人家的鷄的。我想着眞要哭呢！我就只有那一隻鷄了。</p>
<p>老婦人站了起來，撲撲她的破衣襟，把頭上的頭巾扎緊，然後擎起脚旁的「刀正板」，用一根繩很巧妙地吊在頸勃子裏，隨後就伸手去把挿在石墩裏的香拔了起來，就把菜刀打在那「刀正板」上叩起有節拍的響聲來，香烟在她手上繞起一個個小小的白圈子，他好像突然忘記了那男人站在她身邊，顧她自己一面走，一面皷起喉音來大聲呌罵了：「天誅地滅！偷我的鷄吃的燜喉嚨！我的鷄是報曉鷄，守家鷄，吃了爛心肝五臟的短命鬼呀……」</p>
<p>那女人朝着大路，邁進她那纏得很小的老弱的脚，充滿着仇怨，漸罵漸遠了。這裏留下一個年老的單身漢，悵然地站在天燈柱下，好像他所想要的東西突然從他懷裏飛去了一般。那罵聲一句句打上他那業已半聾了的耳鼓。他用力睜着目己的眼睛，好像非看一看他那年輕時的情婦的背影不可似的，一切像波濤一樣的回憶抓住他的心，他的早已老了的血，禁不住帶許多痛苦到他心裏去，我們看得見他低下頭，在他那雙常常流水的紅眼睛裏有點冒出火的梗子了。那老婦人的罵聲巳繞到村內，在那邊震搖着村外的村林了，春光在金黃色的太陽裏。</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>我把雪撬放慢一點，我怕給她發覺了，我儘量仿效巴特　那　生銹的溜冰鞋底饗聲。但這種小心是不必要的。娜麗把她的手深深插在手籠裏，舒服地向後靠着，毛皮頭布幾乎放在我的臂上。「儘管向前推去吧，巴特爾！」她說。巴特爾當然遵命照辦，不勞她可囑第二遍的。</p>
<p>我們已經超過了平常溜冰人所到範國以外了；一點風絲都沒有動；沿湖岸生長的那些變成白色的蘆葦，在西斜日光底下發出眩人的微光。我們繼續向前走去。當我向下看時，我能看出鰻草在透明的玻璃蓋下那種蛇形的運動。</p>
<p>但是湖心誘引着我；我不知不覺把雪撬掉轉方向，我們同湖岸越離越遠了。回轉頭來，我已經祗能看見蘆葦底因光。晦暗的鏡面神秘地展　着，直至那遠遠的對岸，幾乎看不出這鏡面究竟是凝固而能載甫的冰層，還是平靜不波的水面。終於達到湖心了。一切人底足跡都沒有了：雪撬像迷失方向一般，在深黑的湖面上飄泊着。沒有一根草從這透明的薄蓋中伸長出來；因爲據說這裏的湖水是沒有底的。祗是　時我們覺得彷彿底下突然一陣暗影滑過去。也許這是那個柩魚吧？—據傳說，這　窟居在最深的湖底，遇見有人或動物沉溺湖中時候，才到湖面上來。「若是柩魚上來啊！」我想，「若是冰破了啊！」我的眼睛就努力要去看穿這暗黑冰塊下可愛的柩魚所藏身的地方。</p>
<p>我又把雪撬轉了方向，向前推去，但仍不離　湖心範圍。在我們前面，卽在湖岸與一條窄狹的河流交會的地方，那座橋已經遠遠地可以看得見了：橋像影子那樣站在灰色的空氣裏。</p>
<p>「回去吧，巴特爾！天要冷的！」娜　說。</p>
<p>我不理她。「但願她回頭一看啊！」我想，並更快地把雪撬向前推去。　現在正渴望她回頭來看。但她似乎巳經忘肥她的警告了，因爲她一聲不響把頭垂下去並緊裏在外套裏面。—雪　繼續向前飛去。我有時覺得底下發生一種　微的波動，彷彿薄薄的冰無在飛跑的雪　底下，沉下去又昇上來；但　是點不害怕的，我知道應當怎樣去對付那像處女一般的冰。</p>
<p>短促的冬季下午幾乎終結了，日球已經像火一般紅落在地平綫邊緣，天冷了，冰發出籌聲。　在陣雪鳴的爆裂聲，愈鄉愈大，從這邊岸上到那邊岸上，一直響　那正變成黑暗的廣大無涯的冰鏡。</p>
<p>娜　向後一仰，大聲喊了一下。</p>
<p>「不要害怕！」我　輕說，『沒有事情的，這是晚風次出來的聲音。』</p>

<p>— 行安</p>
<p>意大利與阿比西尼亞的衝突，相持許久，至今尙未能得到解抉。上月國聯行政院雖通過一妥協案，而米蘭四人仲裁委員會，也曾一度開會，但依目前進展的局面觀測，兩國間的對立，不惟未見稍呈緩和，且有日加險惡的趨勢。</p>
<p>意大利的企圖吞併阿比西尼亞，墨索里尼的雄心，早巳昭然若揭，爲世人所共覩。其所以屢次下令動員，而未卽發生戰事，蓋墨氏之意，一面無非想藉此武力，以威脅阿國的屈服，一面則尙有所顧忌於英法二國。豈知阿國竟如此倔强，不甘就範，且大有不惜傾全國之師與意軍相周旋之槪，而英法二國，亦不願坐視意國的單獨行動，每有出加干涉的表示。法國邇來雖暫取沉默的態度，英國則已有明白的聲言。上次艾登在衆院曾宣稱：「憑一九〇六年的條約，凡關於阿比西尼亞的一切問題，英法意三國應協商。」而前日新相包爾溫在希姆萊廣廳演說，亦有「獨裁政府可作出人意外的舉動」之言。</p>
<p>墨氏受此衝動，見志未得逞，自必心有不快。是故近日爲貫徹其旣定的策</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>路，一方實行第三次動員，向阿國作進一步的壓迫，他方亦發出針鋒相對的言詞，謂意國的行爲，當由意國自行决定，不容局外置喙，以答復艾登的聲明。墨氏之言一發表，英意兩國的輿論，亦各以嚴厲之語相交謫。此事現在雖因意國駐英大使回國報告，和法國居間斡旋的結果，不至擴大，但兩國間一度發生的裂痕，亦已無可彌補。由意阿的爭端，引起英意的糾紛，足見阿比西尼亞問題的嚴重性也。</p>
<p>近日艾登雖在意國，解釋英德海軍協定的淵源，並以調解意阿事件爲任務，吾恐意國不見得肯遷就呢？</p>
<h3 id="c229">月 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 胡思衷</p>
<p>我愛月。我愛那圓圓的臉頰，那潔凈的面孔，和那溫婉的姿態。在長天一碧，蔚蓋無雲的當兒，她所統治着的世界，是怎麽美麗，怎麽穩秘，和怎麼迷人呵！</p>
<p>由月光所籠罩着的世界，日問刺人的光芒是收縮了，於是詩情誕生，而溫意撒滿在大地。這時侯，凉風每每伴着月亮的銀光而出現，世界呈現着另一番景象，而人心也茁長着另一番滋味。空氣是充滿着甜溫的氛國的的：日里人間的一切醜怪污穢約形象，也都悄悄地穩退。月亮兒用她溫柔的銀光，遮蓋去醜惡的一切，而慰撫着痛苦和不幸的人世。如果人在這時光爬上高山的頂峯，他將見那凹凸的巉巖化爲灰白色的小石，而大地成爲迷糊的秘境。樹林罩上了朦朧的灰烟，巨大醜惡的深綠也會化爲神秘的溫柔的小草。廣袤的田園會變爲平坦無垠的大道，而人間不平的高低和大小的屋宇，只成爲兒童里的可愛的玩具。這時候唱一支歌，會響澈澈漢：低吟一首詩，會播散於瀰慢的原野：便是低低地做個嘆息，那凄凉的滋味也將感動酣睡的人們。如果這時唱一支催眠歌，那迷力也會將不夜的都市摧入甜甜的酣臥。</p>
<p>或者去在渺茫的大海上，看月光在深藍的浪濤上跳着銀花，那景色是世界上最好的裝飾。更好是有大風，把浪花幻成千變萬化的花樣。這時大海茫無邊際，世界好像空洞而無物。天上微小的星星只閃着細小的眼睛，人間的動物好像軟麻或麻醉。海上的大魚會突然地掉下了一下尾巴，那動作只表示着感動，而不是惱怒。大海雖躍起了狂濤，然而這世界仍然是和平而委婉，塡塞着迷人的靜謐。</p>
<p>或者是有個可愛的人伴行在身邊，去在大林間散步。這時月光從繁密的樹葉間篩下疏疏的小影，樹叢挺着雄偉的身軀。月的銀光會幫助着戀人瀉出甜甜的蜜語，樹林也似秘密地在偷聽。輕靜的步聲會響出和諧的步伐，月亮兒會在戀人的心上蓋上神聖的永久的警約。銀光撫過愛人的心，吻上愛人的唇·替滔滔的甜言做證，也替戀人們先訂下下次月亮再圓時約會的時光。</p>
<p>如果同年輕的伙伴泛舟在河的中流，那人生的樂趣也不是易於取得。這時月亮把河水鍍上一層薄薄的銀色，河水返射出晶亮的返光。一把槳撥出了河水的潺潺之聲；舟中一曲歌，或一個歡笑，可以把愉樂的心情傳染到岸上。蘆葦受着輕槳的挑撥，可以奏出悅人的音樂；天邊一朶小雲，也會有一種巨大的力量，把少年們引去溯尋河源，探出幽秘來。</p>
<p>便是在月缺之夕，月亮兒也還有她的迷力。你看她那含羞的少女的姿態，輕盈的步伐，和那隱秘的神情，怎麽在年靑的伙子們底心上起着作用。這時大地雖然黑暗，天上却還閃着星星，眉彎的月亮燭照在空間，失戀的人會覺着傷心，年老的人會懷憶過去，而征人會憶念着遠離的少婦。一旦到月缺還圓，而溫柔的銀光又可安慰着他們，喊醒着他們，或撫摩着他們，而使他們心中歡躍，仍舊充滿着愉快或再生的熱望了。</p>
<h3 id="c230">夢 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>如烟的往事，迥想起來，簡直是一塲夢吧了！</p>
<p>每當夜閒人靜的深夜，寫不出文章停着筆在思索的時候，不其然而然地我的腦海里總會勾繞起往事的記憶來，擾煩了我的平靜的心緒，終於，我恨恨地把筆使勁地扔在桌子上，噓出一口氣很傷心地嘆息着，「誰能料到現在，會困在這窄狹的亭子間里，對者昏黃黯淡鬼火般的燈光，寫這撈什子文章呢？……人生，原不過是一塲夢　縹緲的夢吧了！」陡然腦袋低沉得像窗外　風搖蕩，低垂的楊柳枝條，壓低着嘶啞沉長的嗓音，喘牛似的呻吟着。</p>
<p>六七年前，正是自家抱負宏大，傲妄一切的時候。那時，父親在南國卜暹羅！的生意還未受經濟恐慌的浪潮的襲擊，他不時地攀起那隻握着雄厚的經淸力量的肥潤的手，捻着嘴唇上的兩撇八字鬚，默默地運用着他的精明的腦力，計劃着怎麽去發展他的生意，使他更加得到光榮，而受人們的稱讚，羨慕！就在那個經濟裕如的時候，我剛修竟了我的中學課程，得到父親的允許，遠涉重洋，到南國去觀光一下番邦的風光景物。每當傍晚後的時分，我總喜歡和店夥杜子昌拖着拖鞋，踽踽地到皇家田的人行道上去散步，欣賞那從陰蓊的葉縫里篩漏下來的銀碎般的月光：或上廣闊陰森的「佛越」，聽和尙嗡嗡喃喃地唸着佛經，叮叮篤篤的敲打鐘罄；或駕着一葉扁舟，泛到蜿，平靜的湄南河的中流，一面剝食南國特有底甜蜜清新的水果，一面靜聆著遠處傳來的「水帕」是暹羅人的水上的「家」）上的少女宛轉悠揚的歌唱。那時，杜子昌時常有心無意地露着笑臉對我說：「四少，你看番邦的景緻是多麽的美麗，唐山那有這世界昇平的夜情呢！我想你還是長久地住下來，帮忙「座山」管理商務，然後，慢慢地選個年輕而已漂緻的番娘締給起來，哈哈，四少，番娘的情性大多是柔順的，對丈夫體貼得像一匹馴良的貓兒，那時宜室宜家是多麼的融洽快樂的啊！」他咳咳地掃淸一下嘶了的喉，又繼續地說：「你又不是想中洋狀元，卽又何必想升大學和出國留學哩！……其實就是中了洋狀元，弄個把什麽博士回來，賺起錢來也未必會比「座山」賺得多。四少，我的話說得有道理嗎？」他這些囉哩囉囌的話，徘徊在我的耳朶里，似乎沒有什麽多大的影響與效力，我沉寂了一會，才漫不經意輕淡地回答着：「子昌哥，我的個性似乎不大合適於做生意的，要我整天地守坐在店里，那答答的打着算盤珠子，簡直像在坐牢！無論如何這生活我是幹不了的。」自然，那時的心理，對於這些絲毫不能苟且，笑裏藏刀的商人，不消說起了無限的厭惡和鄙視，使我對於商摥彷彿柄鑒似的格格的不能相入，自家的心里想，除了多研究一些學問之外，經營商業這條路是走不通的。不久，父親終於接受我的意見，送我回國升學，當我離開南國的時候，父親還親自送至碼頭，不讓情感顯露到臉頰上拖沉着嗓音，一字一字地嚴厲地敦訓着：「雲兒，以後要好好地用工，祈望有點成就，光光門楣。……」他說完之後，鬆了一口氣，彷彿已把希望寄托，在兒子的身上了。</p>
<p>如今，父親的那隻握着雄厚的經濟權的肥潤的手，巳失去了昔日的力量，乾枯得微微的顫抖着。雖則他的剛毅，沉默而又十足理智的頭腦，不在不斷地計劃着恢復昔年的光榮，可是，蕭條的市情，明顯地已給他一個絕大的失望；就是他的希望所寄托的兒子，也還不能有分毫達到他的願望，使他的臉孔灰黯起來，像蒙着一層薄塵似的，頭髮也斑斑的花白，而進入了暮年的悲哀與寂寞了！</p>
<p>當我想起自家的前途，和如姻的往事的時侯，心的深處就起了一陣不能言說的惆悵，人生，原不過一塲夢！縹渺的夢吧了！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Negotiations Regarding the Case in Chahar Have Concluded: Mutual Understanding Will Prevent Future Misunderstandings; Both Sides Held Final Earnest Talks Yesterday; Doihara Said Obstacles Were Removed; Qin Dechun's Intent to Resign May Be Withdrawn <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The final instructions regarding the Chahar case negotiations arrived in Ping at 11 PM on the 26th. Immediately after, Qin Dechun invited Lei Shourong and others to his residence to carefully consider the wording of the reply to the Japanese side. At 1 AM on the 27th, Chen Juesheng was dispatched to the Japanese Consulate to visit Doihara, arranging for a final earnest discussion between the two sides at 11 AM on the 27th in the military attache's office of the Japanese Embassy. Qin went to the Military Affairs Commission at 8 AM on the 27th for discussions. Doihara arrived at the Japanese Embassy at 9:15 AM to await the meeting. At 10:20 AM, Lei Shourong and Chen Juesheng arrived at the Japanese Embassy first, exchanging a few words with Takahashi and Doihara. At 10:40 AM, Lei took a car to the Military Affairs Commission to pick up Qin. At 11:15 AM, they arrived together, and Watanabe Yuji, the Japanese military attache, respectfully ushered Qin into the room to meet with Doihara and Takahashi. They spoke for about half an hour, and at 11:40 AM, they left together. The Chahar case negotiations thus came to a conclusion. Afterwards, reporters separately interviewed Qin and Doihara regarding the resolution of the case. Qin issued a written statement, stating that regarding the Zhangbei incident, the Kwantung Army insisted on its resolution. He had followed the Central Government's telegram and conducted negotiations under the direction of the Military Affairs Commission. After several direct and indirect earnest discussions with Major General Doihara in Ping, they reached a final decision through open and honest communication: (1) those responsible for the incident will be punished, and the Chief of Staff and the Chief of Military Law of the 132nd Division will be replaced; (2) mutual understanding will prevent future misunderstandings. The negotiations concluded here. The process was reported to the Central Government at all times and handled in full accordance with the Central Government's instructions. He only fulfilled his responsibility as a local authority. He also visited Major General Doihara this morning as a return visit for his visit on the 23rd. Military Attache Takahashi was also present, and the meeting was very harmonious. According to Doihara's statement to reporters, the Zhangbei incident has now been resolved satisfactorily. He was deeply pleased with the Chahar authorities' sincerity in resolving the issue. He believes that Sino-Japanese relations will have further cooperation. He could not disclose the details of the resolution process because he was not authorized to do so. The Japanese troops at Gubeikou will withdraw immediately. He exchanged views with Wang Kemin on general Sino-Japanese issues during a previous visit, which was also very harmonious. The Dushikou incident is not a problem. He plans to stay for another day or two before going to Tianjin and returning to report. (Central News Agency telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun plans to go to Tianjin on the 28th to visit Song Zheyuan and return to Chahar to resume his duties within days. His intent to resign may be withdrawn. Chairman Lin and President Yuan have both sent telegrams to persuade him to stay. (Central News Agency telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara and Qin Dechun met at He Qigong's dinner party last night. There is currently a lack of reliable information, but all sectors of the Chinese community here believe that the activities of the Japanese troops in Dushikou are aimed at forcing a resolution to the Chahar case. (Reuters telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Army Attache Office announced at 11:40 AM that since the Chahar case on June 23rd, the Chahar authorities have accepted the Japanese solution during the formal negotiations and have handled the follow-up matters in a concrete manner, thus resolving the negotiations satisfactorily. (Dentsu telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 11:15 AM this morning, Qin Dechun and Lei Shourong arrived at the Japanese Embassy's military attache's office by car, shaking hands with Major General Doihara and Military Attache Takahashi. The Chahar case was thus completely resolved. They raised their glasses in a toast, and then went to the gate for a photo to commemorate Qin's fatigue. Qin's face also showed joy. Qin and Lei left the military attache's office at 11:35 AM. Soon after, Major General Doihara issued a statement, saying that he had planned to leave in two or three days to contact the Tianjin army, but the Chahar case had delayed him until now. He was very pleased that it had been resolved. All issues in North China have now been resolved. All obstacles between China and Japan in North China have been completely eliminated. He is scheduled to return to "Manchukuo" on the 29th. (Dentsu telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Army Headquarters received the following report from Major General Doihara: As a result of the final meeting between Major General Doihara and Qin Dechun this morning, the entire Chahar issue was resolved by 10:15 AM. The Kwantung Army immediately convened an emergency staff meeting to exchange important views on the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations after the satisfactory resolution of the North China and Chahar incidents. (Dentsu telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a formal statement today by Japanese Military Attache Takahashi, the Chahar incident has been resolved satisfactorily. After the Japanese side requested a written response last night, the Chinese representative telegraphed Nanjing for instructions. After Qin Dechun received new instructions from the Central Government this morning, he visited Doihara, and the Chahar case was resolved. Doihara will stay in Ping for several days. At the same time, the Japanese side formally declared that the Dushikou incident has also been resolved. The clashes at the time were only between the Chinese and "Manchukuo" troops, and the Kwantung Army did not participate, so no demands were made to the Chinese side. The news of the resolution of the Chahar incident has cleared the air. According to sources in Nanjing, the Japanese side no longer insists on a written solution to the North China issue, and North China is expected to be temporarily peaceful. However, it is widely rumored that plainclothes teams similar to those who caused disturbances in Tianjin in 1933 have infiltrated Beiping, and it is inevitable that disgruntled politicians will conspire to cause trouble. Therefore, people are still uneasy. The military authorities here have adopted strict measures to prevent disturbances. In addition to plainclothes teams, many Koreans have also come to Ping recently. They are clearly not tourists, and their purpose here is puzzling. (Reuters telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying returned to Ping from Tianjin at 6:42 PM on the 27th. According to him, Song Zheyuan's illness has not yet healed. Chairman Chiang sent a telegram of condolences yesterday, and extended his regards. The issue of his future position is not currently being discussed. Qin's intent to resign has not yet been withdrawn. (Central News Agency telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Malanyu news: Three hundred Japanese soldiers stationed in Malanyu had been delayed due to suppressing Sun Yongqin's banditry. Now that the area is peaceful, they began to withdraw on the 25th. On the afternoon of the 24th, a Japanese plane flew from Chengde to Miyun, conducting low-altitude reconnaissance, and then flew to the Malanyu airfield to land. In the afternoon, it took off with three bombers stationed at the local airfield and returned to Chengde along the Great Wall line.

<p>(Beiping) Wang Kemin hosted the Beiping press tonight, making a statement that Huang is still recovering from illness and needs short-term recuperation. The Central Government has appointed him to act as the chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee. He has come to handle unfinished matters. In addition to the committee's expenses being tightened in accordance with the new budget, everything else will remain the same. The Hebei issue is largely expected to be resolved. The Zhangbei incident is being discussed in Ping by the Japanese side and acting Chairman Qin. There are many Japanese troops stationed in the Gubeikou area, and once all incidents are resolved, they should be withdrawn to their original defenses. He will conduct all negotiations in accordance with the Central Government's policy of good neighborliness and will proceed with the utmost sincerity, and will contact all parties at any time, only hoping that all matters will gradually subside and no more problems will arise. He believes that the situation in North China will become more stable in the future. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">There Will Be Partial Changes to the Members of the Hebei Provincial Government; He Yingqin Urges Shang Zhen to Take Office; Cheng Ke is Scheduled to Take Over Tomorrow <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen sent a telegram on the 27th to the Central Government, requesting that the members of the Hebei Provincial Government be reorganized, and attached a proposed list of provincial committee members and concurrent department committee members, requesting the Central Government to review and issue an order. Shang plans to go after the announcement, so that the provincial government can be reorganized upon his assumption of office. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) He Yingqin sent a telegram to Tianjin on the night of the 26th, one congratulating Shang Zhen on being appointed chairman of Hebei and urging him to take office quickly so that the provincial government would have someone in charge and the public would be at peace, and the other urging Cheng Ke to take over as mayor of Tianjin quickly to avoid interruption of municipal affairs. The telegram was forwarded by Shang Zhen on the morning of the 27th. At 7 PM on the afternoon of the 27th, Cheng Ke visited Shang Zhen to discuss the date of taking office. Cheng will prepare everything within the 28th, and can take office on the morning of the 29th. Since the 27th, all departments of the municipal government have completed their closing procedures. Except for important official business which will be handled as usual, non-essential matters have been suspended. The municipal routine meeting scheduled to be held today was not held due to the closing procedures. Shang Zhen still went to the municipal government in the afternoon to review official documents and receive guests. The new mayor of Tianjin, Cheng Ke, has invited Xiang Dizong, a member of the North China Water Conservancy Commission, to serve as the secretary-general of the municipal government. The current secretary-general, Liu Suichang, will go to Baoding with Shang Zhen to take a key position in the provincial government. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen said that the date of his departure from Tianjin is still difficult to determine, because the new mayor has not yet set a date for taking office, so he has no way to relinquish his responsibility. Chairman He sent a telegram on the 26th urging Cheng Zhongyu to take over as mayor, which has already been forwarded. It is expected that the handover will still not be possible on the 28th. When he leaves Tianjin for Baoding, he plans to stay in Ping for half a day to meet with Chairman Wang Shulu to discuss everything, and then go to Baoding. The reorganization of the provincial government is inevitable. Partial changes to the department heads and committee members have been suggested by him, and may be studied and approved at the Central Political Conference on the 28th. Provincial administration cannot be managed by one person alone, so it is necessary to have competent people to assist him, so that there will be no mistakes. There is nothing commendable about the administration of Tianjin City for eighteen days, but there are a few things that he plans to suggest to his successor to complete: (1) build a power plant in the special district, to generate electricity independently by November of next year and supply it to all users in the district; (2) build the Tianjin-Tanggu highway to facilitate transportation between Tianjin and Tanggu. In addition, the municipal government is currently studying the reorganization and upgrade plan, and the division of police power between the three special districts and the municipal public security bureau is also requested to be continued by the new mayor. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The organizational regulations of the Tianjin-Guzhen Security Department's Leng Unit were announced, with a total of fourteen articles, directly under the Ping Military Affairs Commission, with jurisdiction over Ninghe County, Tanggu, and the vicinity of Tianjin-Guzhen, and the boundary of Tianjin County, commanding the army, police, and water police in the security zone, and military-related agencies. After the duty allocation is properly arranged, it will be submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for approval. When necessary, inspection stations, car teams, and inspection offices will be set up. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen told reporters on the 27th that the date of his departure from Tianjin has not yet been determined. There will be partial changes in the provincial government. He has drafted his opinions and telegraphed them to the Central Government. He will go to Ping to transfer to Baoding after the candidates for each department committee member are announced and the handover here is completed. He will stay in Ping for one day to visit acting Chairman Wang and ask for instructions on everything. As for his concurrent position as mayor of Tianjin, it will be for a very short period. He has decided to suggest to his successor to continue to carry out the business that he plans to promote. (Central News Agency telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Agenda for Today's Legislative Yuan Meeting <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan meeting on the morning of the 28th will discuss important cases such as the Vocational Introduction Law, the Civil Servant Performance Appraisal Law and Reward and Punishment Regulations, the Bankruptcy Implementation Law, and the Sichuan Reconstruction Public Bonds. The Ministry of Finance's proposed fund-raising methods for the budget deficit in the 23rd year will also be submitted for closed-door review. It is understood that these methods of the Ministry of Finance are based on the provisions of the general budget for the 23rd year, and the general budget for the 23rd year has been passed by the Legislative Yuan, so it is expected that the case can be successfully passed in the meeting on the 28th. According to informed sources, as stated in the national general budget for the 23rd year, the total budget income and expenditure for that year will be insufficient, and the Ministry of Finance will set aside financial resources as collateral to raise debt funds. From this, it can be inferred that the Ministry of Finance has determined... (Central News Agency telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The original debt income listed in the temporary income section of the national general budget for the 23rd year was 50 million yuan, and it was noted that the total budget income and expenditure for that year was insufficient, and the Ministry of Finance would set aside financial resources as collateral for borrowing. The Ministry of Finance originally planned to prepare the collateral fund and raise debt to make up for it as soon as possible, but it has not been held due to various reasons. All the funds for the budget deficit have been borrowed from banks by the national treasury on a monthly basis to cope with the situation. Now that the year is over, these loans are due, and the financial situation in Shanghai is tight, so it is not appropriate to delay the repayment. In accordance with the debt funds listed in the budget for the 23rd year, the Ministry of Finance has drafted formal fundraising methods to offset these interest-bearing loans, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Central Political Council for approval, and then sent them to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan approved and sent them to the Finance Committee for review. The Finance Committee invited Zou Lin, Political Deputy of the Ministry of Finance, Pang Songzhou, Director of the Accounting Department, and He Xiaoxia, Section Chief of the Public Debt Department, to attend the meeting on the 26th to explain, and then passed the case as it was submitted, and submitted it to this week's Yuan meeting for review. After the Yuan meeting passes it, these methods will be announced and issued at the end of this month. (Central News Agency telegram, 27th)</p>

He is scheduled to visit President Wang on the 28th to report on the political situation in Jiangxi and ask for instructions on everything. According to Xiong, he came at the invitation of President Wang to report on the political situation in Jiangxi, and has no other tasks. He plans to return to the province in a few days. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xiong Shihui arrived in Nanjing at 1:00 PM on the 27th from Xun on the China Merchants Bureau's Jianguo Wheel with his wife and several staff members. Cao Haosen, Peng Xuepei, Chen Rui, and more than a dozen other people welcomed him at the dock. After Xiong went ashore, he went to Gao's residence to rest. According to Xiong's interview with the Central News Agency reporter, he came to Beijing to report on the political affairs of Jiangxi Province. Jiangxi's finances are very difficult. He previously requested the Central Government to allocate 1 million yuan from the salt tax surcharge for the 26th year to subsidize it. He plans to contact the Ministry of Finance while he is here. Only in northeastern Jiangxi are there scattered small groups of remnants, which can be wiped out soon. Rehabilitation work is proceeding according to the original plan. He will stay in Beijing for about a week, and will return to Jiangxi after the work is completed, without going elsewhere. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xiong Shihui told people that in addition to reporting on Jiangxi's political affairs to the central authorities, he also asked for instructions on other political matters. The society in Jiangxi Province is currently becoming stable. In the counties of western and northern Jiangxi, there are still a few bad elements who occasionally cause disturbances. After the defense of the local teams, the situation has gradually returned to normal. Jiangxi Province suffered a drought last year, and income was difficult, but after trying to adjust it, there has been considerable progress. The issue of Jiangxi Province's political expenses for the next year will also be discussed with the central authorities. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The merger of the Post Office and the Savings and Remittance Bureau is scheduled to be implemented from July 1. The Savings Bureau has sent Secretary Wang Zhijing to Beijing to discuss everything. The organization of the Savings Bureau will not change after the merger, only the word "(General)" in the Savings Bureau will be removed. Business and accounting are still independent.

<p>(Nanjing) Disputes arise when various agencies in Nanjing requisition land. The municipal government believes that the past disputes were caused by too much requisition and unfair prices. Now it plans to improve. Two Commissioners, Sun and Duan, have proposed methods: 1. When various agencies in the capital requisition land, they must first apply to the municipal government for the purpose. If it is not necessary, or it is not necessary to requisition land in the near suburbs, it shall not be requisitioned. 2. The area of land required must be clearly stated in detail and must not be arbitrarily expanded, or there must be any acts of using public office for private gain. 3. For the selection of land, the requisitioning agency must have two or one different plots of land for flexibility. 4. After the above conditions are set, they will first be sent to the Finance Bureau for review, then promulgated by the Ministry of Interior, and then the Finance Bureau will send personnel to measure the land. 5. The Finance Bureau will be responsible for negotiating the land price. For land that has been requisitioned for many years, the land tax should be transferred at any time.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of reducing the sentences of convicted prisoners, since the Central Political Conference resolved to postpone the discussion in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, it has been almost two years. The judicial authorities now believe that the number of criminals in various provinces has increased dramatically, even more than before. The number of newly imprisoned prisoners has mostly exceeded twice the previous number. In a blink of an eye, it is the hot summer, and epidemics are rampant, which is especially pitiful. Therefore, it has drafted reduction methods and reiterated the previous request. The Central Political Conference's parole methods have been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. At the same time, Chen Guofu put forward his opinions on the case, arguing that for criminals whose crimes have already been determined, the scope of fines in lieu of imprisonment can also be appropriately expanded in accordance with the spirit of the new criminal law, allowing fines to offset the unexpired prison terms, which was also resolved by the Central Political Conference and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reference. Sun Ke has approved the case and sent it to the Criminal Law and Legal System Committees for review. The contents of the parole methods can only be determined after the review is completed.

<h3 id="e23">British Mediation of the Italian-Ethiopian Dispute <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Britain has dispatched Eden to Italy to mediate the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, this being the second time. The result of the previous mediation was that Italy and Ethiopia would organize an arbitration committee in accordance with the 1928 Treaty of Friendship to resolve the dispute, with a deadline of August 25th this year to complete the solution. If no agreement is reached by then, the League of Nations Administrative Council will handle the matter. However, since Eden's return to England, Mussolini has continued to increase troops in East Africa while repeatedly issuing statements that do not allow third-party interference. At the same time, the Italian newspapers are unanimously attacking England. Judging from the intense emotions of the Italian government and people, it can be seen that Italy fundamentally does not want to abandon its ambition to seize Ethiopia. The reason why it temporarily accepted Eden's mediation plan is probably to give England face. Now that the Anglo-German naval agreement has been established, and cracks have appeared in the Anglo-French-Italian front against Germany, Italy can barely contain its anger towards England. Britain seeks Italy's understanding at this time, fearing it might be too late. Now it wants to mediate the Italian-Ethiopian dispute again. The difficulty of this matter will certainly be even greater than Eden's previous trip to Rome.</p>
<p>The most difficult aspect of Britain's mediation of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute is the issue of the League of Nations' credibility. Although Abyssinia is an African country, it is also a member of the League of Nations. According to the charter, other member states should not infringe on its territorial integrity and sovereign independence. Moreover, Britain has always claimed to be upholding the League of Nations' credibility in its past interventions in Italy. How can it now suddenly undermine its position to show goodwill to the Italians? Therefore, judging from this point, even if the British want to make concessions to Italy, they may not be able to come up with a plan that does not harm the League of Nations' credibility, so as to satisfy Italy's desires. According to recent telegrams, Eden's mediation plan is to allow Italy to build a railway through Ethiopian territory to connect Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. For Ethiopia, Britain would allow it to use British Somaliland ports to the Red Sea as compensation. This is truly a way to save face for both Italy and Ethiopia, while not putting the League of Nations in a hopeless situation. However, Mussolini insists on fundamentally changing the Ethiopian political system and has rejected the above mediation plan. Therefore, in order to gain Italy's favor and achieve its goal of stabilizing the European situation, Britain may have to reconsider the Ethiopian issue.</p>

<p>(London) British financial expert Sir Otto Niemeyer plans to depart for China on August 10th. The route has not yet been decided, but it is widely believed that Niemeyer will travel via the United States and arrive in Shanghai around the second week of September. Niemeyer is currently studying Chinese affairs. Business and political circles are paying increasing attention to Niemeyer's mission, recognizing that Niemeyer's trip is a concrete manifestation of the British government's intention to adopt an active policy in the Far East. However, this move is not intended to be anti-Japanese, nor is it hostile to Japan's natural interests, but rather an effort to seek cooperation for the common benefit and peace of the Far East.

<p>(Paris) Minister Without Portfolio Eden and his entourage arrived here from Rome at 10:05 this morning. They held talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval and French experts until 1:30 PM. According to an official communique, the talks today only discussed how to find the best way to reconcile the methods used by the two governments to implement the various procedures contained in the London Declaration of February 3rd. The British government advocates that the various security organization issues be negotiated and handled separately, while the French government advocates joint handling. A way to adjust the two must be sought. It is heard that this issue will be discussed further by the British and French governments through diplomatic negotiations. (27th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) After returning here from Rome today, Eden immediately met with French Prime Minister Laval for two hours. Although no concrete decisions were made, progress has been made on finding a common position to adjust the methods by which the British and French governments implement the procedures outlined in the London Declaration of February 2nd. It is widely believed that Eden informed Laval of his meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini regarding the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. Eden is scheduled to depart for London this afternoon.

<p>(London) According to reliable sources here, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has expressed to British Minister Without Portfolio Eden during yesterday's talks that he will reject Britain's proposal and demand important rights from Ethiopia. It is heard that Mussolini has demanded that Ethiopia become a protectorate, with Italy having the right to station officials in the Ethiopian capital. From this point of view, Britain's mediation has obviously completely failed. At the same time, Italy has entered a state where war could break out at any time.

<p>(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's expression of stern demands for a thorough solution to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, as a permanent solution, has caused alarm in all the newspapers this morning. It is believed that Eden will realize during his reunion with French Prime Minister Laval in Paris that war in North Africa cannot be avoided this autumn, and that Italy may challenge the League of Nations. Its seriousness should be no less than Japan's handling of the Manchurian issue. The diplomatic correspondent of the Morning Post said that Italy cannot be satisfied unless Abyssinia is made an informal protectorate of Italy. Italy's current goal is to build a railway to connect Eritrea with Italian Somaliland facing Asab. Since the Italian Prime Minister explained his position on these points, Eden no longer presented the British mediation proposal to him. The British Cabinet meeting yesterday viewed this result as a serious development. The Daily Telegraph said that the Italians now intend to make Abyssinia a protectorate of the Italian army, with everything done in the manner of Morocco, and Emperor Selassie in the position of a puppet. Only then can the situation in Northeast Africa be resolved. At the same time, Italy's war preparations in Northeast Africa are still actively underway. In the past few weeks, regular troops have regularly departed from Cagliari. The final two divisions of Blackshirts to be mobilized are undergoing rigorous training in Naples and will soon depart as well. (27th, Reuter's Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) It has been learned here that Mussolini did not accept any of the points of peace appealed by Eden, British Minister for League of Nations Affairs, during the talks in Rome. Eden claimed that if Italy goes to war with Ethiopia, the policy of cooperation between Britain, France and Italy on the European political situation will inevitably be hit. Furthermore, if Italy, as a member of the League of Nations, adopts the means of war against another member state, what a blow this will be to international relations. It is known that the concessions Britain has persuaded Ethiopia to make are twofold: one is to increase Italy's business opportunities in Ethiopia and the development of various industries in Ethiopia such as mining and agriculture; the other is to allow Italy to colonize the Agaton province of Ethiopia.

According to the Ethiopian King, if Eden's economic proposals to Mussolini do not harm the territorial integrity and sovereign independence of Ethiopia, then Ethiopia is very willing to fulfill them.

<p>(Rome) Regarding the situation of the British-Italian talks, it has now been confirmed that Prime Minister Mussolini insisted that the various issues related to the organization of European peace be mixed together and should not be handled separately. Regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement, the two sides had a thorough discussion on the attitude of Britain in concluding the agreement and its relationship with various European issues, but did not engage in research in technical aspects, largely because Italy did not want to be bound in the slightest. In addition, Italy did not reject or explicitly agree to the dispatch of naval experts to England for talks. As for the Sky Locarno Convention, its establishment will largely depend on whether the European security system can be implemented as a whole. The "Diplomacy" magazine outlined Italy's stance on the Anglo-German naval agreement, saying that "Italy's hesitation is mostly political in nature. If Italy and Germany conclude a naval agreement, stipulating the ratio of naval tonnage between the two countries, how will England deal with it?" The "Fascist Party Work Report" also said that the policy adopted by Britain is not very clear, expressing dissatisfaction. (26th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian newspaper, which is intended to be the mouthpiece of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made an extremely important revelation today about Eden's visit to Italy, roughly saying that Eden claimed that the Anglo-German naval agreement was only a temporary draft and would only take effect if all the countries concerned agreed to it. Furthermore, the Fascist newspaper also said that the Italian political circles found this explanation by Eden to Mussolini extremely difficult to understand, because if what Eden said was true, then the German side would not be so excited about the establishment of this agreement. The newspaper also said that the foreign policy of Britain is specialized in probing the intentions of others, while adopting a deep and unobtrusive attitude toward its own intentions.

<p>(London) During the House of Lords meeting today, Conservative Party member Lord Lloyd began debating the naval and military situation influenced by the Anglo-German naval agreement, criticizing the government for changing its policy four times in January, and expressing dissatisfaction with the British government's unilateral action allowing Germany to change the Treaty of Versailles, causing an "atmosphere of disturbance" in France and Italy, saying that Britain now allows Germany to possess a navy equal to 35% of the British navy, while the Washington Naval Treaty limited France and Italy to only 32.5% each. This agreement gives Germany all kinds of conveniences and will trigger a large-scale construction of warships by various countries. Labour Party member Lord Strabolgi followed up by saying that the Labour Party agreed with most of the sentiments expressed by Lord Lloyd just now. If France has concluded an equal submarine fleet agreement with Germany, or if Britain has an agreement with Japan to stab the United States in the back, what will the British government say? Although the Anglo-German agreement is praised for its swiftness in some British circles, he believes that it will eventually prove to be unfavorable. Strabolgi then advocated collective guarantees to protect commercial routes from attack. Liberal Party Marquess of Lothian expressed his opinion that the agreement could increase the hope of achieving a satisfactory result at the Disarmament Conference. Conservative Party Earl Howe did not think so, and said that he intended that the agreement would likely cause a major anti-naval restriction incident. Germany's fleet, having reached 25% of the total number of British ships, will make it impossible for the British fleet to sail east of the Suez Canal in the near future, so the Singapore naval base will lose its effectiveness. Fleet Commander Earl Beatty spoke, saying that he intended that the current British naval strength was insufficient, and the government should urgently invoke the "escalator" clause. He hoped that the current international naval talks could achieve a satisfactory result, so that the Naval Conference could be held this year. As for the Anglo-German naval agreement, judging from the facts of the situation, it is a necessary measure, and the agreement does not hinder other naval countries. If all countries can take the same approach and agree with Germany on land and air armaments, it will greatly benefit Britain and the rest of the world. Before the establishment of the agreement, Britain heard the criticism from France, but the British government could not fail to approve such a treaty that could benefit world peace because of France's opposition. Now, I hope that the French government will understand the overall situation and realize that the agreement will eventually benefit France. (27th, Reuter's Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) Three drafts were submitted to the Chamber of Deputies today, all of which were to increase spending in addition to the defense spending set in 1935, including an increase of 1,106,000,000 francs for the army, 1,800,000,000 francs for air defense, and 200,000,000 francs for the navy, totaling approximately £40 million in British gold.

<p>Brest, France - Navy Minister Pietri recently gave a speech here regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement, roughly saying that Britain's hasty recognition of Germany's naval rearmament was not cautious. The naval figures were something we had almost forgotten, but the ratio of naval tonnage obtained by Germany is enough to make us uneasy. As a result, we will inevitably have to pay attention to naval figures again. From now on, we should concentrate our efforts on the construction of battleships. This is only natural, because the battleships of various countries are restricted by the Washington Naval Treaty, and do not account for a significant tonnage within the total naval tonnage. From now on, we will have the right to free action to make French battleships occupy an important position. (27th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Senate Naval Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee, which are discussing the Anglo-German naval agreement and French foreign policy, specially extended the meeting time to hear reports from Navy Chief Pietri and Prime Minister Laval. Navy Chief Pietri first stood up to report on France's response to England regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement. Pietri said that since this agreement is a bilateral agreement between England and Germany, France can take complete freedom of action from now on. However, if Britain and other naval countries want to negotiate naval issues with France, they can proceed as usual, without any problems. After Pietri finished his report, Laval stood up to report on the results of his previous tour of Eastern Europe and his talks with Goering in Poland. Laval believes that France's policy must be based on the League of Nations as the main institution for European peace. He mentioned the German note stating that the Franco-Russian mutual assistance agreement does not comply with the Locarno provisions. Laval declared that the conclusion of this agreement was fully approved by the British and Italian governments. Regarding the Austrian issue, Laval declared that if Austria's independence is threatened by foreign forces, France is willing to adopt a cooperative policy with all related countries. Laval continued to say that Hitler's previous peaceful remarks towards France in Congress have opened the door for Franco-German negotiations.

<p>(Berlin) The Cabinet passed the Compulsory Labor Service Law at this evening's meeting, stipulating that all young people across the country must perform labor service for six months. In addition, it also passed the Wartime Air Defense Law. Head of State Hitler declared at the Cabinet meeting that the term of compulsory labor service is temporarily set at half a year. In the first year of labor service, all able-bodied men born in 1915 across the country must perform service. (26th, National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Cabinet passed a decree implementing universal compulsory labor service for men tonight. This is a preliminary to military service. It is heard that the term will be six months. Next year's new "labor army" will be limited to 200,000 people, and will be composed of the 1915 class and volunteers. Volunteers must be at least 18 years old. Women will also join the labor army, but special regulations still need to be formulated, because the female labor corps has not yet reached the capacity to accommodate hundreds of thousands of girls. The new labor army will be named the Labor Service Corps. According to government announcements, this labor service is a matter of honor, so no wages will be paid. (26th, Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to the new German law, people over the age of 20 must engage in compulsory labor before serving in the military. This compulsory labor system was recently explained by officials, saying that according to the law, young men and women should engage in compulsory labor equally. However, at present, there are not enough institutions to provide women's labor. If hundreds of thousands of young women across the country joined compulsory labor at the same time, they would not be able to accommodate them. Therefore, the method of women's participation in compulsory labor will be stipulated separately in the future. As for compulsory labor for young men, the Minister of Interior Frick will direct everything, and Colonel Hier will be its leader. According to the Conscription Law, those who are non-Aryan or married to non-Aryans are exempt from military service. However, those of non-Aryan race who are exempted from military service may still participate in compulsory labor, but will not be awarded military ranks. In addition, those who have been deprived of their civil rights due to opposition to the state are exempt from the obligation of compulsory labor. Furthermore, those who reside abroad or wish to go abroad are exempt from the obligation of compulsory labor during their residence abroad. (26th, Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) On the afternoon of the 26th, Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, visited Foreign Minister Hirota to reiterate a protest regarding the shooting of Soviet Red Army soldiers in early June on the Russian-"Manchukuo" border. Hirota explained the content of reports received from the military, adding that the shooting of Russian soldiers by Japanese troops was an act of legitimate self-defense and that the Russian protest was groundless. The Foreign Minister further stated that if a commission were established to mediate border disputes between Japan, "Manchukuo," and Russia, it could prevent all untoward incidents and quickly resolve matters. The Soviet Russian government has previously agreed in principle to establishing such a commission. He asked if a concrete plan could be proposed soon to achieve this. The Russian ambassador replied that he would seek instructions from his government on this issue. The Foreign Minister continued, saying that the Russian government's current concentration of large forces on the Far Eastern border to strengthen border defenses gave an unpleasant impression to the relations between Japan, "Manchukuo," and Russia. The Russian government should consider withdrawing a portion of its Far Eastern garrison. (27th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>

(3) If a small committee cannot resolve a dispute, it will report to the central committee in Harbin.

<p>(Washington) Local authorities indicated today that the recent decline in silver prices is merely a technical adjustment in the global silver market, due to the current supply and demand relationship. It is said that the recent surge in sales of physical silver has overwhelmed the U.S. Treasury Department and other purchasers. However, the primary source of these sales is unknown. (It is generally believed that India is the largest seller. However, it is claimed in Washington that there have been no recent events that triggered the decline. However, the Treasury Department is unwilling to be manipulated by speculators, so all of its actions are designed to thwart speculators. Some believe that the imminent adjournment of Congress, with no new silver legislation being proposed in the near future, may be one cause of the decline. Silver advocates in Congress have encountered political difficulties because rising silver prices are very harmful to China, and U.S. agricultural exports have also declined considerably in the past year. Therefore, the government's silver policy has been heavily criticized. Recently, the Treasury Department's actions have been very secretive, and there is no time limit for achieving the goal of a gold-to-silver ratio of three to one, making it difficult to predict the silver issue. Treasury officials, as they still need to purchase silver, are naturally unwilling to reveal the truth. Although silver advocates in Congress still hope to pass some silver legislation during this session of Congress, President Roosevelt's wealth redistribution plan has become the most important issue in Congress, forcing other matters to be temporarily shelved.

Because Fujian and Jiangxi provinces are adjacent to Zhejiang, he needs to discuss with the two chairmen, Chen and Xiong, on issues concerning neighborhood construction and defense. Therefore, he plans to postpone his return. Huang said that the central work plan of Zhejiang Province for the 24th year has been decided, but the Ministry of Finance still feels a little exhausted. If no special problems occur in the future, efforts will be made to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, or difficulties can be avoided. Also, the banditry in the border areas of Zhejiang Province has been largely suppressed, and the administrative plan will be easier to promote. (27th, special dispatch)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Recent continuous heavy rainfall has caused the Jiang and Xiang Rivers to rise simultaneously. Wuhan, situated at the confluence of these two rivers, experiences a particularly drastic increase in water levels. On the 23rd and 24th, the water rose by 1.2 meters each day, followed by 1.1 meters on the 25th and another 1.2 meters on the 26th. Within a few days, the water level has risen approximately five feet. According to the Jianghan Customs water gauge, the level on the 26th reached 39.2 meters, exceeding last year's highest recorded level and continuing to rise, indicating an increasingly severe situation. In the Wuchang area, some dikes and sluice gates have already shown cracks. In Hankou, the Zhanggong Dike and Jinyin Lake also exhibit precarious conditions. The Fenjin Furnace drainage sluice gate is nearly level with the river surface, all of which require serious attention. The provincial and municipal authorities have separately established flood prevention committees working around the clock with great urgency. The provincial capital, from Qingshan to Jinkou, has been divided into four sections, each with an engineering team of 50 people stationed to repair and defend the dikes. Survey teams have also been dispatched to work. The Hankou Flood Prevention Committee held a meeting today, resolving to establish the first and second flood prevention sections ahead of schedule, each headed by a section chief to oversee operations. The budget will be adjusted according to the water level and submitted to the National Economic Council for approval. Regarding dike patrols, in addition to patrol personnel, the Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and all members of the provincial and municipal flood prevention committees have also been dispatched to inspect their respective sections to ensure thoroughness. The Lianghu Supervisory Commissioner's Office has also dispatched Section Chief An Mengzhou to inspect the dikes. Reports indicate that at Huangwuli on the Wufeng Dike in Wuchang, four cracks have been found in the dike's body, the largest being about two zhang wide and over a foot deep, with a subsidence of more than a foot. The smaller ones are about a zhang long and three or four inches wide. This location is the breach point of the major flood of 1931. The entire dike project is most vulnerable at this point. Supervisory Commissioner Gao Yihan specifically notified all water conservancy agencies on the 26th to pay close attention to prevent breaches. (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Financial Stability in Hankou: Money Shops Organize Adjustment Committee and Public Treasury; Banks Undertake to Release Loans with Large Amounts of Cash Shipped to Hankou <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: During the final accounting period of 1934, Hankou's financial situation suddenly experienced unprecedented panic, with money shops bearing the brunt. The collapses of Yuanyuan and Zhongyuan were followed by the suspensions of Dayuan, Delong, and Yongmao, causing widespread alarm and anxiety throughout the city. Stabilizing the entire financial system has become the sole objective of the government and the financial sector. The main measures include the establishment of a public treasury by government banks to provide loans to money shops, and the organization of a public treasury by money shops to provide loans to commercial firms, offering assistance at each level and maintaining mutual support. Furthermore, due to a shortage of cash, efforts are being made to ship cash to Hankou for circulation. The Central, China, Communications, Farmers, and Hubei Provincial Banks, responsible for organizing the public treasury, held meetings and decided that, as a first step, each would prepare 200,000 yuan, raising a total of one million yuan in cash to provide loans to money shops, with the Bank of Communications designated as the representative, without setting up a separate agency. On the money shop side, a public treasury is being established, with Xiesheng, Yanyuan, Zhengji, Anyu, Changyu, Gengyu, Ruilong, Chengcheng, Xinshui, Zhengyu, Fuyuan, Junyu, Huihe, and Chengji each contributing 30,000 yuan, and Jinhebao, Yuxinfeng, Lianyi, Lifeng, and Yuanfeng each contributing 20,000 yuan, totaling 540,000 yuan as the public treasury fund. Li Dezhai, Wang Shanchen, Cao Tingxian, Wang Bishuang, Wang Jingyuan, Kang Buyun, Wang Xinfu, Jin Fuqing, Zhao Yuting, Yu Xiaopu, Tang Mingchen, Luo Daohe, Xiao Baoshan, Zeng Yongchen, Zhou Chunzhi, Xu Shengjie, Xiao Heqing, and Xiao Fengzhang have been appointed as committee members, responsible for accepting loans from fellow businesses and foreign firms. A temporary financial adjustment committee has also been established, with Wang Bishuang as the director, responsible for presiding over the committee's affairs and allocating funds. Accountant Wu Jingheng and Cao Yanxian are responsible for accounting matters, while Wang Shancheng and Zhou Chunzhi are responsible for the custody of collateral and funds. Li Dezhai, Sun Kunshan, Wang Xinfu, Kang Buyun, Xiao Heqing, Zhao Yuting, Jin Fuqing, Hui Yongchen, and Xiao Baoshan are responsible for reviewing the quality of collateral goods. Yu Xiaopu, Luo Daohe, Guan Fuju, Xu Shengjie, and Kang Mingchen are responsible for investigating the value of collateral. As for cash, Hankou itself is lacking. On the 25th, the Central, China, and Communications Banks jointly telegraphed their head offices, allocating 2 million yuan in cash, which was shipped to Hankou by boat that day. On the 26th, the Bank of Communications independently obtained approval to ship another 1 million yuan in cash. All of this is expected to arrive within three or four days. Therefore, the financial market has stabilized, and public confidence has greatly increased. In the short term, there should be no further panic. (26th)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: In addition to establishing the Anti-Opium General Association in Wuchang and announcing its organizational regulations, the Headquarters, in accordance with its prescribed measures for implementing opium prohibition, requires all provinces, cities, and counties to separately organize anti-opium committees and sub-committees.

<h3 id="e93">Anhui Provincial Government Plans for Both Flood and Drought, Dispatches Personnel to Inspect River Dikes <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Government, noting that rainfall had been scarce since the beginning of summer, leading to an increasing drought, formulated eight emergency measures for drought relief, ordering all counties to comply. It also repeatedly instructed all counties and radio stations to report local weather conditions daily. However, in recent days, all areas have reported rainfall, and the rain has been continuous, causing rivers to rise. As a result, the general public fears the arrival of floods, causing widespread anxiety. The Provincial Government, noting that Tongcheng, Wuwei, Hexian, Fanchang, Wuhu, Dangtu, Susong, Wangjiang, Huaining, Dongzhi, Guichi, and Tongling counties are located along the Yangtze River and heavily rely on irrigation, has realized the critical importance of opening sluices and breaching dikes. Given the potential for hesitation or delayed requests for instructions, which could lead to missed opportunities, the government deemed it necessary to dispatch personnel to conduct inspections as soon as possible. These personnel are to assess the extent of the disaster, observe the river tides, and prepare in advance for the opening of dikes. In areas where the terrain is high and difficult for the river tides to reach, they should assess the terrain and prepare for the installation of water pumps. Furthermore, as the summer flood season has arrived and the floodwaters are increasing daily, it is necessary to ensure the safety of the river dikes while preventing drought. Therefore, the government has copied and distributed dike opening measures to the aforementioned counties, and ordered Wang Deyu, a technician from the Department of Construction, to jointly inspect the river dikes. If there is a need to open sluices or breach dikes, or if the dike situation is precarious, the relevant county government should immediately order the conscription of laborers to carry out emergency repairs to quickly remedy the situation, without delay. They are also instructed to report back for assessment after the event. Furthermore, according to reports, the Huai and Si River areas have a network of rivers and canals, but due to years of neglect, the water conservancy situation is poor. Although Meng and other counties have undertaken river works this year, there has been no overall planning, and many projects have been suspended due to the busy farming season. If these projects are not continued, it is feared that during the flood season, water will flow to low-lying areas, causing the people to suffer from the harm of river dredging. It seems that they should continue to carry out these projects during the slightly less busy farming season. The government has also ordered the counties to continue working on unfinished river projects during the farming slack season to ensure their complete completion. It plans to dispatch personnel to conduct inspections at any time to observe the results. (June 24th)</p>

They were spotted by night patrolman Xu Fuyuan, who immediately arrested them. Police Chief Kong Debiao reported the incident to the director, who went to investigate and found a large hole in the wall. When the two vagrants were interrogated, Zhao Lagou confessed that he had secretly hidden a large nail taken from a pillar and used it to dig the wall after being locked up, and that Wang Da had helped him move bricks. Director Sun, considering that the incident was discovered early and did not lead to a major disaster, sent the two vagrants to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiang Xiaosi, a farmer from Cao'anhou Village, Maqiao River East Township, Fourth District, Jiangdu, had to replant small seedlings due to rain. The whole family went to work in the fields, leaving his mother-in-law, Old Woman Ma, at home to cook. Old Woman Ma, who was nearly seventy years old and frail, accidentally left the fire in the stove next to a pile of firewood. The fire quickly raged, shooting straight through the roof. When Jiang saw it from the fields, he rushed back to save her. All the miscellaneous items in the house were turned to ashes, and Old Woman Ma was burned, her hair and skin damaged. She collapsed in a corner of the wall. Old Woman Ma died from the effects of the fire.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Another Section of the Liuyi Riverbank Collapses <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Another section of the Liuyi Riverbank, east of the Zhenyang Bus Station, collapsed on the morning of the 26th. It is said that the collapse has actually slowed down the river flow. Initially, the flow coming from the west side would hit the protruding point on the east side, causing a U-turn right at the bus ferry terminal. This created a large whirlpool under the terminal, making the situation increasingly dangerous. Now that this point has collapsed, the return wave has been reduced, which has also reduced the scouring effect of the whirlpool at the terminal entrance. According to employees of the Zhenyang Bus Company, the depth of the water outside the shore is still around one zhang, while the depth within one zhang is about four feet. Therefore, mud and wooden stakes are being placed for reinforcement. If there are no further changes after the mud placement, the ferry can resume docking on the 27th.</p>

<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market was slightly firm this morning. At 1 pm, the July contract was 6.35, up 3 points.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market opened steady, but prices eased due to large-scale selling by retail investors and profit-taking on July long positions. Later, prices recovered slightly due to a poor US weather report. At 1 pm, the July contract was 5 shillings, 3 pence, down 0.25.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The Chicago wheat market opened lower, due to improved weather conditions in the producing regions. The same was true for coarse grains.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>

<p>All Banks Will Be Closed on July 1st and 2nd</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, in order to handle the year-end settlements, all banks have been extending their office hours internally since yesterday, depending on the business of each bank, but externally they still operate according to regulations. As for savings departments and current account balances, interest has been calculated up to June 20th for the first half of the year, and after June 20th it will be for the second half of the year. The calculation of profits and losses has already begun, and it is expected that the settlement will be completed before July 2nd. On July 1st and 2nd, although banks with busy operations will be closed to the public, they will still be working as usual internally to rush to complete the closing of accounts. The collection and remittance between banks and between money shops and banks has been particularly busy these days.</p>
<p>Closed on the 1st and 2nd</p>
<p>The Bankers Association has stipulated that member banks will be closed on July 1st and 2nd for semi-annual settlement, and will resume business as usual on the 3rd. As for Sundays, with the exception of the Ningbo Commercial Bank, China Banking Corporation, Wing Hang Bank, and Tung Hwa Bank, which will remain open in the morning due to different business conditions, all other banks will be closed. Now, China Banking Corporation and Tung Hwa Bank have decided to close all day on Sundays starting from the second half of the year.

As for the year-end settlements of various banks in the first half of the year, although they have not yet been finalized, it is expected that all banks, large and small, will still have surpluses in this period of industrial and commercial recession, but the amounts will vary. However, it is not known whether there are any bad debts and how many. If a bank has many bad debts, it may appear to have a surplus on the surface, but in reality, it is losing money because bad debts are not easily recoverable.</p>
<p>Sharp Increase in Check Clearings</p>
<p>As the end of June settlement period for banks is approaching, the total amount of checks cleared by the bank clearing house increased sharply yesterday, amounting to 33,788,822.07 silver dollars, including 5,866,565.40 silver dollars in cash and 27,922,256.67 silver dollars in remittances, an increase of two-thirds compared to the previous day.

<p>Passed by the General Assembly of the Shipping Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association had previously, at the request of shipping merchants, resolved to adopt a contractionary policy, whereby the salaries of all crew members above 15 yuan would be paid at 80%. Subsequently, due to a petition from crew members' organizations, it convened a general meeting of all members at its meeting place on Wuma Road at 3 pm yesterday. The attending executive and supervisory committee members included Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Yang Guanbei, Wang Zigang, Yao Shumin, Chen Yisheng, Zhou Zian, Lu Yingen, Ye Chuanfang, and over thirty other members. Yu Qiaqing, the chairman, opened the meeting as usual. First, Yu reported on the petition from the maritime workers' organizations. According to the representatives, crew members with salaries above 15 yuan cannot make a living if their salaries are paid at 80%, and they requested that shipping merchants show consideration. He then solicited the opinions of all members. After that, the discussion began. The group believed that the maritime workers' request was reasonable and should be accepted. It was unanimously passed that the salaries of lower-level crew members should definitely not be reduced. Whether the salaries of higher-level crew members should be reduced should be decided by each company based on its own financial situation. The remaining motions were passed summarily. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 pm.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Planning to Build a Large-Scale Radio Transmitting Station - Internal Announcement of Land Acquisition from the Public - Songjiang County Has Been Instructed to Comply <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Due to the development of wireless telegraph services, the existing radio transmitting station of the International Telegraph Administration is insufficient. It has selected 300 mu of land near Qianliang Temple in Xinzhuang Township, west of Shanghai, to build a large-scale radio transmitting station. Regarding the acquisition of land from the public, the Administration has received an announcement from the Ministry of Interior. The announcement states: "It has been approved that the Ministry of Transportation's telegram Cai Zi No. 220 of March 2, 24th year of the Republic of China, states: 'It has been found that in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Wireless Telegraph Main Station of the International Telegraph Administration was attached to the Shanghai Middle School in Lujiabang. The foundation is extremely narrow and difficult to develop. The school buildings are also planned to be renovated and have repeatedly urged relocation. It is imperative to find another open area to relocate the new station. After surveying a vacant area near Qianliang Temple on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road, it was found to be very suitable. It is proposed to acquire 300 mu of land according to the Land Expropriation Law. A plan and layout map have been prepared and submitted to your Ministry for review and approval under Tu Zi No. 490. A bulletin No. 38 was attached. Subsequently, the January 28th Incident occurred in Shanghai, and it was temporarily suspended. Now that the Shanghai Radio Station has been merged with the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, according to the report submitted by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, the need to relocate the transmitting station is even more urgent. The number of transmitters to be installed in the future is even greater than before. It is proposed to continue the acquisition of vacant land at Qianliang Temple and expand it to 300 mu. However, the previous announcement has been more than three years old and has lost its validity. Please consult your Ministry to review the previous case, reissue the announcement, and consult the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the Songjiang County Government to comply.' After examining the request of the Bureau to acquire 300 mu of vacant land at Qianliang Temple, it is indeed necessary, which is consistent with the provisions of Article 2 of the Land Expropriation Law and should be approved. In addition to consulting for review and response, in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the same law, the matters that should be announced are listed below for general knowledge. This is hereby announced. The items are: (1) Person in charge of the undertaking: Ministry of Transportation; (2) Type of undertaking: Development of transportation undertakings; (3) Area of the undertaking: Within the 36th Bao and 51st Tu of Xinzhuang Township, Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province (that is, the vacant area near the Qianliang Temple Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, north of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway and south of Changqiao Town), with a total area of 300 mu."</p>

<p>For the purpose of implementing the aid plan, the various groups in this city that are assisting the Overseas Chinese Federation in Siam have separately sent letters and telegrams to various ports at home and abroad to prohibit the sale of Siamese rice. The Overseas Chinese Federation believes that the actual situation of Siamese rice shipments to China is of concern to those interested in Sino-Siamese trade and society. It has specially recorded statistics on Siamese rice shipments to China from the first year of the Republic of China to the twelfth year (units outside of Hong Kong are in piculs) and publishes them as follows:</p>
<p>Siamese Rice Imports - Total Imported Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Year 1: 2.959 - 2.700.391</p>
<p>Year 2: 3.915 - 5.414.896</p>

<p>Average: 1.096.141 - 12.286.100</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, with the exception of the ninth year of the Republic, when there were no imports due to the competition of Japanese buyers, the most Siamese rice imported in any year was 7.551.554 piculs in the 22nd year of the Republic, and the least was 1.959 piculs in the first year of the Republic. The year with the most imports accounted for approximately 30% of the total amount of foreign rice. The number of Siamese rice imports from the first to the twenty-first year of the Republic, transshipped from Hong Kong, may have been included in the Hong Kong import amount. If Hong Kong is included, the number should not be small.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that the Royal Dutch Mail Steamer Company, to facilitate transportation between Asia and Africa, has decided to launch an unprecedented long-distance route from the sea to South Africa and from Shanghai to East Africa. It has appointed the Java Shipping Company in this port as the general manager. The first mail steamer departing from Shanghai to South Africa is scheduled to sail on July 7. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Long Sea Voyage</p>
<p>Recognizing the absence of direct scheduled services between Asia and Africa, the Royal Dutch Shipping Company has initiated these two routes. The sea voyage is of unprecedented length, requiring 150 days for a round trip for each ship. Therefore, only one sailing per month is scheduled. From now on, Asia and Africa can be directly connected, which will greatly boost trade between the two continents.</p>
<p>Route Determined</p>
<p>The routes for both lines have been determined. The South Africa route runs from Shanghai to Cebu, Manila, Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, Batavia, Mauritius, Lourenco Margues, Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, Mossel Bay, Cape Town, and then back from Cape Town to Durban, Tamatave, Reunion, Mauritius, Rcdriguez, Batavia, Singapore, Cebu, and Hong Kong. The East Africa route starts from Hong Kong to Bangkok, Singapore, Batavia, Rcdriguez, Mauritius, Reunion, Tamatave, Durban, Beira, Znuzibar, Mombasa, Mahe, Singapore, and Hong Kong, before arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Designated Mail Ships</p>
<p>The shipping company has designated six mail ships for the long voyages of these two routes. The first ship, the Good Hope, with a deadweight of 5,400 tons, is already en route from Hong Kong to East Africa. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on July 5 and depart for the South Africa route on July 7. It is expected to return to Hong Kong on September 27. The second ship, the Barents, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for various South African ports on August 4. The third ship, the Sweeden Hordijk, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on September 3. The fourth ship, the Loxleven, the fifth ship, the Tasman, and the sixth ship, the Mindegula, are all scheduled to depart on schedule.</p>

<p>The joint association of Shanghai groups supporting the overseas Chinese in Siam previously sent representatives to Beijing to petition and to connect with Beijing groups in order to expand the organization. The results were very satisfactory. After returning to Shanghai, they sent letters to the rice industries in Shanghai and Guangdong, requesting a strict boycott of Siamese rice imports. It is now learned that the association believes that the anti-Chinese situation in Siam has not eased. Siam's economy is based on agriculture, with rice being its main export. Sales of Siamese rice in Shanghai are small, and imports have already been suspended, but they are very large in South China. To achieve a thorough boycott, representatives will be dispatched to Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places for on-site investigations, and to ensure that those areas will not import Siamese rice in the future. It has been decided to hold the fourth standing committee meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow at the National Goods Maintenance Association on Nine Acres Land to discuss the dispatch of representatives to South China and other issues.</p>

Most of the bank's depositors are small industrialists, merchants, and proletarians. They have suffered immense pain from this loss. The creditors Wang Hongzhang, Chen Zhonggao, etc., have organized the Ningbo Industrial Bank Creditors' Association to handle the registration of creditors' rights free of charge. The office is located at No. 5 Ping Le Li, Xizang Road. More than 2,000 households have registered, with debts totaling 500,600 yuan. In order to protect the legal rights of creditors, the association has resolved to request the Ministry of Finance to immediately appoint a liquidator and to arrest the directors and supervisors. The bank is still planning to resume business and is requesting the creditors to postpone liquidation. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Wu Zhihao, general manager of Ningbo Industrial Bank, sent a letter to the Creditors' Association yesterday, saying: (omitted above) Ningbo Industrial Bank was affected by the sluggish market and suspended collection and payment. I have heard that your Creditors' Association has sent a letter to the special commissioner Luo of the Ministry of Finance to appoint a liquidator to handle the liquidation of the bank's assets and liabilities. This is appropriate and I have no objection. However, the directors and supervisors of Ningbo Bank are trying to maintain it. In order to take care of the rights and interests of your creditors, I sincerely request your association to forward the letter to the special commissioner Luo of the Ministry of Finance and postpone the handling for 14 days. I hope you will approve it.</p>

The savings portion should be repaid first. The amount of accounts collected by the bank is about 1.5 million yuan, plus one-fourth of the savings guarantee deposited with the Ministry of Finance. The total amount is enough to repay the savings deposits, which will be repaid first. As for the commercial portion, it depends on the result of the account collection. The number of months for repayment cannot be estimated at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Executive Yuan and Other Institutions Requesting Exemption of Special Industrial Provincial Taxes <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in accordance with the resolution of the Sixth General Assembly, submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that it was a request for matters. The association held the Sixth General Assembly of Members on June 23. According to the proposal of the Dachung Dyeing Factory Co., Ltd., the government should issue a notice to all provinces that all special industrial products exempted from taxes by the Ministry of Finance should also be exempted from provincial taxes. The original proposal stated that domestic industry is in decline, and the trade deficit is increasing. Under the intrusion of foreign forces, emerging industries are even more difficult to survive. Without the government's solid protection, it is not enough to plan for survival. Therefore, the government has regulations for industrial incentives. All emerging industries that have been reviewed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and meet the requirements may request the Ministry of Finance to approve special tax reductions and exemptions. Its position is equal to that of products that have already paid unified taxes. It should not bear provincial tax obligations. The meaning is very clear, and the principle that one thing should not be taxed twice has long been established in the decree. However, at present, special taxes are often levied due to the special circumstances of a province. The industrial products that the Ministry approves and rewards with tax exemption are treated the same as imported goods, and are forced to pay taxes twice. Although there are cases where tax reductions and exemptions are granted after it has been clarified that it is a tax-exempt national product, it cannot be said that there are none. However, regardless of the reason, complete disapproval is issued, causing merchants to appeal repeatedly and eventually go astray. Such odd situations violate the established system that one thing should not be taxed twice, as well as the original intention of the government to reward and exempt taxes. Therefore, we propose that the government clearly stipulate measures and issue a notice to all provinces that all industrial products that have been rewarded by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and specially exempted from taxes by the Ministry of Finance shall be exempted from provincial taxes in order to reward and develop industry. Is it appropriate? We respectfully await the general assembly to decide. It is learned that the company's man-made pigment, vulcanized element, has been approved by the Ministry of Finance (Jun) to be exempted from transit tariffs within a certain period in accordance with the Industrial Incentive Law. Unexpectedly, the product is transported to various provinces in the country, and there are tax bureaus that levy taxes in the form of disguised likin. Among them, there are also cases where the company has declared the tax exemption and has been approved, but the Gan Province rejects it on the grounds that it is a common case, and the Xiang Taxation Bureau in Wuzhou, Guangxi, is still in dispute. The main purpose of the original proposal is here. In the past, during the era when likin was not abolished, cases of taxing foreign-style goods manufactured according to machinery, after paying taxes in accordance with regulations at the first port, could still be sold throughout the country without being taxed again. Now that likin has been abolished, each province should no longer have so-called production and sales taxes and other similar names. According to Articles 62, Fifth and Sixth of the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage, and the National Financial Conference of the previous year, the original plan was to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes. This taxation is originally illegal. Moreover, the central government specially approves the exemption of transit tariffs for items that are subject to the Industrial Incentive Law, but each province still maintains its established situation and insists on taxing them. Not only is the order to abolish likin equal to a mere formality, but also the Industrial Incentive Law is only implemented in the central government, not in each province, which inevitably violates the spirit of unified laws and regulations. It has been resolved by the general assembly to submit to the government for correction and prevention. It is reasonable to record the case and prepare a document to submit to your court (department) for review and approval for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The济生会 Reports on the Tragic Famine in Liyang <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Report by Investigator Yin Shunzhang</p>
<p>The Central China Relief Society, in conjunction with various provincial drought relief associations, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society, and the Liyang Drought Relief Association, is managing spring relief efforts in Liyang. Director Li Yundoujun is in charge of investigation and distribution, with over ten relief workers. The work is nearing completion. Now, investigator Yin Shunzhang has returned to Shanghai and submitted a report on the tragic situation in Liyang, as follows: (1) The sixth and third districts are the most severely affected areas. Famine victims are displaced and have no food, filling their stomachs with white clay and elm bark. In the places surveyed, the elm trees have been completely stripped of their bark. Larger shops in the villages, such as those selling dried goods, Beijing and Guangzhou products, cotton cloth, and sugar, have all closed down. Only a few small stalls, such as pancake shops, tofu shops, and general goods stalls, barely manage to survive. (2) Throughout the villages, famine victims are selling their sons and daughters everywhere. According to surveys, a large number of men and women have been sold in the past year, comparable to the tragic famine in Shaanxi Province in the past. (3) This year, it has not rained for a long time, and farmers cannot plant rice seedlings. The rivers are shallow and dry, and farmers have no money to pump water, so they can only resign themselves to fate. The most miserable account for nearly five-tenths of the population. Since there are no rice seedlings to plant, even with local efforts to find solutions, they have exhausted all resources and can do nothing. Fortunately, this time, there has been timely rain, and the rice seedlings that have been planted can recover. However, the mountain fields cannot be salvaged. (3) Liyang is originally a silk-producing area. In recent years, due to the low price of silk, local silkworm cocoons are worth only eleven or twelve yuan, and improved varieties are worth eighteen or nineteen yuan. Villagers work hard for a spring but do not get their money's worth. No one even cares about mulberry leaves. Many shops in the area have closed down, and the number of unemployed people is increasing everywhere. They have no way to borrow money and no way to beg for food. Many have committed suicide. The hardship is hard to describe in words. The association provides relief as much as possible, but there is not enough to go around. It is difficult to manage the aftermath, and famine victims are dying everywhere. Unable to afford coffins, the association also arranges for this. The association has been running disaster relief in various provinces for many years with great success. In recent years, due to commercial depression and people's suffering, donations have been affected, and the source of funds has been decreasing day by day. This time, when running the Liyang relief effort, with the cooperation of charities, they appealed everywhere and raised a small amount of money to distribute, but it is truly a drop in the bucket. However, they hope that the rain will be abundant in the future, and there will be a good harvest in the autumn, so that the people can recover from their hardships. This would be fortunate not only for Liyang County.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Female Corpse Discovered in a Pile of Gravel <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Knife wound on the neck</p>
<p>Victim appears to have been dead for several days</p>
<p>In an open space at the corner of Xujiahui Road and Route Ratard in the French Concession, inside a pile of gravel used by the French Public Works Department for road construction, at 11:45 yesterday morning, a laborer digging gravel discovered the corpse of an unidentified woman who had been murdered. The upper and lower body were naked, without a thread of clothing, with cropped hair and unbound feet. The victim appears to have been dead for several days. There was a knife wound on her neck, the cut was very deep. The skin and flesh of her hands and feet had rotted and fallen off, making it impossible to recognize her face. She was approximately thirty years old, and the stench was unbearable. The workers were horrified and immediately informed Officer No. 513 at the nearby Baojian Road Fuxu Police Station. The police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. After inspecting the scene, they notified the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-station and ordered workers to transport the body to the morgue, pending an inspection by personnel from the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office today. In the meantime, the head of the French police detective team has instructed all detectives to strictly investigate the case and bring the perpetrators to justice for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Collision Between Chunhua and Qingning on the Huangpu River <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Inspecting the extent of damage</p>
<p>Preparing for import and repair</p>
<p>The Qingning steamer of the Shanghai-Ningbo Steamship Company was berthed at buoys No. 8 and No. 9 in the Huangpu River, while the Chunhua steamer of the Xinghua Steamship Company was moving from buoy No. 24 to buoys No. 9 and No. 10 at 7:34 a.m. on the 26th. At that time, the tide was rapid, and the hull was subjected to the pressure of the tide, causing it to collide with the Qingning steamer. The Chunhua steamer attempted to retreat to avoid the collision, but it was too late, resulting in a violent impact on the stern of the Qingning, causing damage.</p>
<p>Extent of damage</p>
<p>The Qingning was struck a total of two times. After inspection, the damaged iron plates were found to be uneven for a length of more than six feet, and the dent was more than half a foot deep. The extent of the damage to the internal structure below the stern can only be determined after inspection. The Shanghai-Ningbo Company has, based on the report of the captain of the Qingning, sent a letter to the Xinghua Company requesting that they also send personnel to inspect the damage, and has reported the matter to the Maritime Affairs Bureau for their attention.</p>
<p>Request for inspection</p>
<p>The owner of the Chunhua steamer also reported, stating that when the ship was changing berths from buoy No. 24 to buoys No. 9 and No. 10, the ships were close to each other, and due to the rapid tide, it was impossible to prevent the collision, resulting in slight damage to the iron plates on the stern of the Qingning steamer, causing them to be uneven. They have now received a letter from the Shanghai-Ningbo Company requesting that personnel be sent to inspect and repair the damage. They are now reporting to the insurance company, requesting them to promptly dispatch a marine surveyor to the Qingning to inspect the vessel and determine how it should be repaired, which will be negotiated by the insurance company.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Tianjin Fraud Case: Russian Criminal to be Transferred <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Part of the stolen money has been recovered</p>
<p>Three Russians, Sivatzki Fuchs and Madame Beshava, were arrested for aiding the Pylaevs, a husband and wife pair arrested in Tianjin.  The Pylaevs defrauded a Mr. Zhang of over 70,000 yuan under the pretense of buying gold. The arrest of the three Russians has been previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Court President Feng Shide of the First Special Court continued the hearing. Jiang Baolian, the police lawyer, explained the details of the defendants' crimes. During the investigation, Beshava revealed that 1,150 yuan had been recovered from Citibank, 4,900 yuan from a shop in the French Concession, and 496 pounds sterling had been recovered from Peiping. These were all part of the stolen money. Today, officials from the Tianjin Police Department, including Savariko, arrived in court to request the transfer of the suspects. The Tianjin Local Court Prosecutor's Office also sent a telegram to the court. Savariko explained the process of solving the case and requested permission to transfer the suspects. Judge Ma noted that the Tianjin Local Court's documents only named Sivatzki and Beshava, and not Fuchs. Fuchs could only be transferred if the Tianjin court sent further documentation. The representative agreed to immediately telegraph Tianjin, requesting the court to add Fuchs' name. Judge Feng adjourned the hearing until tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Public Works Bureau to Improve City Traffic <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Surveying parking lots and installing traffic lights</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has determined that the increasing number of vehicles in the city has made traffic more complex, with many major intersections experiencing disorder. They are now working to improve traffic, re-surveying rickshaw parking lots and installing traffic lights at key intersections to improve traffic order and convenience for citizens. The details of the improvement plan are as follows:</p>
<p>Re-surveying parking lots</p>
<p>Traffic has recently become increasingly congested in areas like the Old West Gate and Sishan Road in Shanghai South and Zhabei. Many rickshaws waiting for customers wander into the road, and even compete for passengers, which is not conducive to traffic. It is urgent to designate parking areas to improve this situation. The Public Works Bureau, together with the Public Security Bureau and the Engineering Bureau, sent personnel to Shanghai South and Zhabei on the 6th of this month to conduct on-site surveys. They decided to set up 23 parking areas in the Shanghai South district and 17 in the Zhabei district. All traffic signs have been discussed by the Public Works Bureau and the Engineering Bureau for installation, and it is expected that they will be completed in the near future.</p>
<p>Installing traffic lights</p>
<p>There are still too few traffic lights installed at various intersections in the city. The Public Works Bureau has previously planned to install traffic lights at two locations, the Old West Gate and the Baoshan Road intersection, and handed them over to the Public Security Bureau for management. Since being put into use, the results have been good. Other important intersections, such as the Qimei Road-Songhu Road intersection, the Datong Road-Xinmin Road intersection, the Xieqiao-Zhaozhou Road intersection, the Fangxie Road intersection, the Dongmen Road-Waima Road intersection, the Xiaodongmen-Zhongza Road intersection, the Shangwen Road-Zhonghua Road intersection, and the Waima Road-Dadamatou intersection, have also been surveyed by the Public Works Bureau together with relevant bureaus as locations for traffic light installation. The bureau has now hired workers to install red and green lights, build elevated and ground-level traffic control platforms, and plan no-stopping lines and vehicle stopping lines. All of the above projects are said to have started and are expected to be completed within a month.</p>

<p>After living together, he abandons her.  Female student sues him.</p>
<p>Luo Zeyu, the elder brother of Luo Zemou, is sixty-one years old.  He lives at No. 11, Gudong Road, Dongjie, Fuzhou. He has been doing business in Shanghai for many years, residing at No. 71, Xihu Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession.  He opened Henghe Money Exchange in Nanshi, Chinese territory, and has a considerable position in the local community, with substantial assets.  Although Luo is over sixty years old, his lust has not diminished.  Ye Liangzhen, a woman from the same village, is twenty-nine years old. After graduating from a women's middle school in Hangzhou, she came to Shanghai for further education. In June of the 21st year of the Republic, she was introduced to Luo by a Miss Qiu, who falsely claimed that he had no wife and wished to marry Ye. Ye did not hastily agree, and began friendly interactions. She was then lured into a room at the Far Eastern Hotel and sexually assaulted.  Luo then proposed that they rent a house to live together, and then formally hold a wedding ceremony.  They rented places at Sanxingli, Beile Road and Nanwenderli, Tianxiangli, and lived together.  After some time, Ye discovered that Luo's official wife was still alive. She confronted him and urged him to hold a wedding ceremony. After repeated pleading from Luo, he wrote a permanent support agreement on February 6 of the previous year, and gave it to Ye as proof.  From then on, Luo took Ye home to meet his wife, and both addressed each other as sisters, but Luo’s wife did not like Ye and wished for her to leave. Luo abandoned Ye in the Dongfang Apartment. Only after mediation by relatives and friends did Luo rent a place for her at No. 22, Haixue Lane, Chengyuan Road.  However, Luo again had his friends provide for Ye's expenses.  Later, Luo moved Ye to Wuling Apartment on Balang Road.  On December 28 of last year, Luo finally abandoned Ye. After repeated attempts to communicate with him, Luo refused to meet, and no resolution was reached. Recently, Ye, feeling that Luo intended to treat her as a toy, could no longer bear it. She hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Luo Zeyu of violating Article 244, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, by falsely claiming to be in a marital relationship, engaging in illicit sexual relations, and harming public morals, and also violating Article 309, Section 1 of the same code, by abandoning her. She requested that he be prosecuted according to law, and sought incidental civil damages of 10,000 yuan for mental distress, and 50 yuan per month until the age of 60, as stipulated in the support agreement, totaling 19,200 yuan.  Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Wang Gangxu, Chief of the Criminal Division, opened the Second Criminal Court yesterday afternoon to hear the case. The defendant did not appear. Only the plaintiff, Ye Liangzhen, and her lawyer were present. She described her seduction, cohabitation, and abandonment. The judge ordered the court police to deliver a summons to the defendant. According to reports, the defendant was not present, and had gone to the countryside, or that no such person lived there. According to the plaintiff, the defendant did indeed live at No. 71, Xihu Lane, and she had recently encountered him there. The judge ruled that Luo was deliberately evading the summons, and the hearing was adjourned to July 5, at which time the plaintiff was instructed to bring the defendant to court for further questioning.</p>

<p>Men injured and lying in pools of blood; three assailants detained</p>
<p>Cao Zhenquan, a worker in the workshop of the Xiangyin Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, had a feud with Chen Miaoxian, Cai Heshang, and other workers in the same factory. Although friends on both sides had tried to mediate, a satisfactory resolution was never reached. At 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, the factory closed as usual, and over three thousand workers filed out. However, some workers did not leave the factory and lingered around, as if waiting for something. This was noticed by Liu Nuxiu, the factory's petition police chief, who became suspicious and went forward to inquire, urging the workers to leave the factory quickly. Unexpectedly, a tragedy occurred in an instant. Two workers, Cao Zhenquan and Li Jingyi, held foot-long knives and slashed wildly in search of revenge. Police Chief Liu saw this and was shocked. She immediately blew her whistle, calling gatekeeper Zhu Jiaoyao and off-duty policemen Wang Wende and Yao Fusheng to the scene to suppress the situation and stop the attack. However, it was too late. Moreover, there were too many people, making it difficult to manage. Police Chief Liu and the others managed to detain three criminals, Cao Zhenquan, Li Jingyi, and Ren Maoshan. The victims, Cai Heshang, had his arm broken and was slashed in the face, Chen Afu had a knife wound on his neck, and Wang Genrong had a slash wound on the back of his hand. All were lying in pools of blood. Police Chief Liu immediately escorted the criminals to the Pudong Branch Bureau, along with the two knives, and sent them to the local court for questioning and detention. The injured were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Chen Miaoxian, seeing the situation was unfavorable, had fled beforehand and was not injured. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Li Caigui ordered Police Chief Liu Wenxiu and policemen Zhu Jiafan, Wang Wende, and Yao Fusheng to appear in court, along with the detained Cao Zhenquan, Li Jingyi, and Ren Maoshan for questioning. Police Chief Liu and the others described the events and the circumstances of the arrest. As a result, the judge ordered the three defendants to be detained pending further instructions.</p>

<p>The weather in Shanghai has been erratic for the past few days, with rain frequently falling in the afternoon or evening, though not heavily. Yesterday morning, however, the weather felt exceptionally sultry, with intermittent sunshine. Around 5:00 p.m., there was another burst of rain. By evening, the rain had stopped, but the sultriness in the air was even more intense.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Demolition of the Former Bank of China Site <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Construction of an Eight-Story Building</p>
<p>The former site of the Bank of China at the intersection of Renji Road on the Bund has been actively undergoing demolition since the bank decided to relocate and rebuild. However, the project was delayed for three or four months due to the use of the building for the Shanghai pre-exhibition of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art, from preparation to conclusion. Only recently did the Xinrenji Construction Company begin demolition. Over a hundred workers are currently employed, working hard to complete the project within three months, at an estimated cost of three to four thousand yuan. The original building's assets were also won by the company, for over 40,000 yuan. The site includes approximately ten mu of land between Renji Road, Yuanmingyuan Road, and Beijing Road on the Bund. According to the Bank of China's original plan, the entire site was to be rebuilt into a 30-story building. However, due to current market conditions, the new building will be approximately eight stories, with a maximum of ten stories. The foundation will still be suitable for a 30-story building, so that additional floors can be added if necessary in the future. The blueprints for the building are reportedly still undecided, and the pile driving process will take two years.</p>

<p>According to the Public Works Department Fire Department's report for May, the department received a total of 106 alarms that month, nine of which were false alarms. The property at risk from the fires was valued at approximately 14,330,000 yuan within the Public Concession and approximately 220,000 yuan within the Special Tax District. Actual losses amounted to over 71,000 yuan within the Concession and approximately 350 yuan in Special Tax District C. The Emergency East Division received a total of 479 emergency calls that month, and a total of 480 injured people were sent to various hospitals. Furthermore, the Fire Department ambulance rescued 17 people who had fainted on the street during the past month. According to the diagnosis reports from various hospitals, the cause was starvation. The total number of starvation cases for the first five months of this year is 54. Furthermore, in May, 42 people who committed suicide or attempted suicide were sent to various hospitals. The number of suicide cases transported to various hospitals by ambulance in the first five months of this year is 127. In addition, there were 49 opium addicts. These cases are not included in the suicide or attempted suicide statistics, but all were poisoned by ingesting opium, which is similar to attempted suicide.</p>

<p>The Public Works Department Isolation Hospital admitted 23 patients, and its work was relatively light. The number of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis has been increasing, and it is almost impossible to accommodate those suffering from severe lung diseases. Therefore, they have had to release a few patients with milder conditions who have been in the hospital for a long time. The Chinese Isolation Hospital was busier, admitting 94 patients, including 39 with tonsillitis, 15 with scarlet fever, and 2 with rabies. The rabies patients had been bitten by dogs outside the Concession and died in the hospital before they could be treated. The Public Works Department Patrol Hospital admitted 190 patients in May, but its work was not strained. Only one person underwent major surgery. The Indian Patrol Hospital admitted 58 patients in May, and there was nothing special to report. The Ward Road Prison Hospital admitted a total of 118 patients and 19 died, with cases of pulmonary tuberculosis accounting for 14 of the deaths.</p>

<p>In order to organize ferry services on the Huangpu River, the Public Works Bureau issued a notice in July 1934, instructing all ferry operators to submit all ferry boats for inspection. Those that were dilapidated were to be strictly eliminated or extensively repaired, and iron railings were to be installed on both sides of the boat cabins. The ferry operators complied accordingly and reported to the bureau for inspection. A total of 12 ferry docks were inspected, and 100 ferry boats were qualified. The bureau has now determined the number of passengers that each boat can carry according to its capacity, and has manufactured and issued limit signs, which are nailed to the boat in a visible location, strictly prohibiting overloading in order to ensure safety.</p>

<p>The situation is not yet right</p>
<p>An industry source says that since its establishment, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Farmers Bank has successively provided various loans to help rural areas, and its business has been quite developed. In recent days, there have been rumors that the bank plans to provide pawnbroking loans to various morning villages in Shanghai to help them financially. According to Mr. Song, the person in charge of the bank, pawnbroking businesses have been declining due to the impact of the economic downturn in recent years, which is indeed the case. However, the pawnbroking business in the rural areas of Shanghai is better than in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. Considering the situation, it is not yet the right time. The rumor that the bank plans to offer pawnbroking loans in Shanghai is not true.</p>

<p>Over two hundred fruit and produce stack workers in Shanghai previously went on strike to protest the dismissal of their colleagues by the employers, which was a matter of livelihood. The employers also closed down the market. Goods from all directions could not be unloaded, and were rotting, causing serious losses. The strike was resolved, and the strike has been resolved after the city’s party headquarters sent people to mediate. The worker’s existing organization will be dissolved temporarily because it does not conform to regulations. The Fruit Merchant Association will arrange jobs for the thirty-one dismissed workers. It is reported that both parties have received instructions from the city’s party headquarters.</p>

<p>The decline of rural areas in our country in recent years has created various social problems, with huge implications for the future of the nation. The National Christian Council of China has long been concerned about this issue. Three years ago, it allocated a large sum of money and entrusted the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Nanjing Jinling University to use it for rural revival projects. The funds were lent to poor farmers to purchase farm tools, seeds, etc., so that they could revive their farms and improve their livelihoods. The university understood this intention well and earnestly carried out the work after being entrusted, achieving remarkable results. The council was deeply satisfied. Recently, the council, recognizing the importance of rural cooperative enterprises, has entrusted the university with the returned portion of the loan to run a training class to train rural cooperative instructors, so that they can guide rural cooperative enterprises in the future. This is practical rural revival work, not just empty talk.</p>

<p>General Secretary Ding Shujing heads to Geneva</p>
<p>Summer conferences and camps held in various places</p>
<p>Every year, the National Young Women's Christian Association actively strives for summer work, such as holding summer conferences and summer camps, and has achieved considerable success. It is a good idea to use summer leisure time to cultivate the physical and mental well-being of young people. Now that summer has arrived, the recent news of the association's work is as follows: (1) General Secretary Ding Shujing left for Geneva at the beginning of summer to attend the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the World YWCA. Ms. Ding was elected as one of the vice presidents of the association last year. In recent years, the center of the world has shifted to the Far East, and the association also attaches great importance to Far Eastern issues. It is said that next year's Executive Committee meeting will be held in India, and soon the annual meeting will be held in China, so that meetings held in various countries in the Far East can more closely and thoroughly understand Far Eastern issues. (2) This year's summer conferences are being held by the city associations of Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Yunnan. The association is holding the Central China Summer Conference, the East China University Summer Conference, and the East China Girls' High School Summer Conference. Those holding summer camps include Hebei Junior High School, Shanxi Junior High School, Fujian Junior High School, as well as schools in Hong Kong and Shanghai. (3) In addition to summer conferences and summer camps, there is also a rural summer school, which is run by the Fushan County YWCA of Shandong. The teachers are all university ladies. The goal is to use summer leisure time to enable students to go deep into the countryside, thereby arousing interest in rural issues and gaining a deeper understanding of the current situation of the countryside. Rural women can also take the opportunity to learn various courses. (4) There will also be a University Women's Issues Research Conference and a New Staff Training Conference held in the summer. The former is to study various pressing issues for university women, and the latter is to instill various knowledge about the YWCA movement to new staff in various places.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Zhen Xin Stone Powder Factory Accuses Gu Tian Sheng Factory Owner of Breach of Contract <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Xue Yongji Severely Beaten, Public Prosecution Already Filed</p>
<p>Xin Sheng Society reports that the various Fei Hua [Flying Flower] factories in the city were previously troubled by the high prices of stone powder, which affected their costs. Therefore, they invited Gu Yongfu, the owner of Gu Tian Sheng Flower Factory, and leaders of the Fei Hua industry, Xie Zhongle and Bao Guoliang, to discuss with Wang Yansong, Luo Qinghua, Jin Jianxiang, Zheng Chengqing, and other prominent figures in the business community to jointly invest in the establishment of Zhen Xin Machinery Stone Powder Factory. Mr. Wang agreed to initiate the organization, as the industry had foreign trade relations. Furthermore, each factory in the industry signed a sales contract to demonstrate good faith. The contract stipulated that they could not purchase stone powder from other factories or companies within five years. If they purchased stone powder from other factories or companies, regardless of the quantity, it would be considered a breach of contract, and they would be liable for damages of 30,000 yuan. However, after Zhen Xin Factory started producing powder, the stone powder factories jointly lowered prices below cost to counteract it. Consequently, Gu Tian Sheng Flower Factory disregarded its credit and secretly violated the sales contract, repeatedly issuing bounced checks for the payment due to Zhen Xin, amounting to a significant sum. Recently, the factory purchased a large quantity of stone powder from another company, which was spotted by Su Yongqing, an employee of Zhen Xin Factory. When he politely inquired, Gu Yongfu, the owner of Gu Tian Sheng Factory, fearing exposure and the need to pay substantial liquidated damages, became enraged. He ordered his son, Gu Yixiang, and boatman Zhao Changqing, along with several workers, to assault Xue Yongqing, causing severe internal injuries. The water patrol team arrested the perpetrators and sent them to the local court for investigation. The injured party was sent to the hospital for treatment, but his condition was critical. The court dispatched personnel to verify the injuries. On the 24th of this month, prosecutor Lei Binzhang opened the court for investigation, leading to the detention of the defendants. Public prosecution was initiated in accordance with Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the criminal law. Regarding the bounced checks and the full amount of the contract breach, Zhen Xin Factory has also filed a lawsuit according to the law.</p>

<p>Jiang Maolang from Chongming, residing at No. 442, Yulin Road, Lane 4, sells vegetables. His daughter, Xiaoqing, is seventeen years old. In December of last year, she was seduced by Cao Yilang, a twenty-eight-year-old man from Haimen who cohabitated with her while selling bao fan [steamed buns]. They engaged in sexual relations, leading to a secret pregnancy and a bulging abdomen. Fearing her father's rebuke, Cao, on the ninth of this month, sought help from friends Yang Xuefan, Lao Liming, from Tongzhou, and Cai Rongzhang to find an elderly woman surnamed Mou to perform an abortion. After the abortion, she became ill and was sent to Shengxin Hospital for treatment. On the 24th, she recovered and was discharged. Liu Zhisheng, a detective from Yulin Road Police Station, uncovered the truth and arrested Cao. He also learned about Yang and Ding, who resided at No. 292, Taopeng Road, and subsequently apprehended them. Cai Rongzhang and the abortionist elderly woman fled upon hearing the news. The next morning, along with Jiang's daughter, they were all sent to the Simple Trial Division of the First Special District Court. As the case should be heard by the local court, it was transferred to the Third Criminal Court yesterday morning. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that in addition to the crime of abortion under Article 304 of the Criminal Law, there was also a charge of obscenity and seduction, which had not been added. He requested a postponement. Jiang's daughter had not fully recovered, and her father was present in court, requesting temporary custody pending further investigation. Judge Jiang Shuzi approved this, ordering the three defendants Cao Yilang et al. to be remanded in custody for further review.</p>

<p>Old woman Gu Sunshi from Qingpu was walking near the corner of Kunming Road and North Sichuan Road at approximately 3:00 PM on the 19th of this month when Li Asan from Ningbo ran up from behind and forcibly snatched her gold earrings, worth eight yuan. Her ear was torn and bleeding. She cried out in pain, shouting "Robber!" A Westerner nearby saw this and gave chase. At the entrance of Dexing Lane on Peng Road, Li was apprehended. Li seized the opportunity to discard the stolen goods on the ground, which the Westerner recovered. While the Westerner was grappling with Li, Fang Cheng, a Cantonese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, arrived upon hearing the alarm. After learning the details, he took Li Asan and the stolen goods to the police station and then transferred them to the First Special District Court. The defendant denied the charges, claiming that he was startled by the shouts of "Catch the thief" and ran away, and that the gold earrings were taken by someone else. The judge ordered him to be held in custody, and the evidence was returned to Ms. Gu. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi resumed the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the investigation confirmed that the defendant had robbed Ms. Gu's gold earrings. He requested a severe punishment.

As a stranger in a new place, he had no one to turn to for help. Overwhelmed by his circumstances, he became resentful and decided to end his life. He secretly ingested opium along the way. However, upon reaching the various Chayang Lane sections of Keneng Hai Road, the poison took effect, and he collapsed and moaned. Hua Bu No. 3177, a patrol officer from the Hui Si Police Station, spotted him and sent him to Tongren Hospital. After some treatment, he was discharged and taken back to the police station. As he had no residence in Shanghai, he was held overnight. The next morning, the police chief ordered him to be sent to the First Special District Local Court for disposition. He was ordered to be sent to the Anhui Fellow Villagers Association. However, after leaving the court and reaching the entrance, Xu collapsed again. Gao Yuqing, a detective passing by, sent him to Tongren Hospital again, but he died before receiving treatment. The body was transported to the Yielun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special Court appointed Prosecutor Tang to conduct an examination, confirming that the body was male. It was determined that Xu Xichang died from opium poisoning.

<p>Requests Confirmation That Lizhen is Song's Daughter</p>
<p>Song Xueqin, a fifty-seven-year-old man from Wuxing, Zhejiang, was the director of the Shanghai office of Sun Chuanfang, the former commander of the Five Provinces Allied Forces. He followed Sun for many years and was highly regarded by him. He was once prominent, but after the failure, Song also abandoned his political career and became a recluse in Shanghai. He has two residences in Shanghai: one at No. 1, Lane 35, Maite Hesituo Road, and the other at Fushou Lane, Weihaiwei Road. In 1921, Song married Bo Xuezhen (now thirty-four years old) from Wuxian as a concubine, and she gave birth to a daughter named Lizhen, who is now eleven years old. Song and Bo lived together until May 20, 1931, when they divorced due to disagreements. An agreement was made that Song would pay Bo 20,000 yuan and that Lizhen would be raised by Bo. Since the separation, Bo has lived with her daughter at No. 6, Jinle Lane, Weihaiwei Road. However, without legal recognition of Lizhen's identity, her future status and treatment may be affected. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1065 of the Civil Code, which states that a child born out of wedlock is considered legitimate if acknowledged by the father, and that a child raised by the father is considered acknowledged, she has requested mediation from the Mediation Office of the First Special District Court to confirm that Lizhen is Song Xueqin's biological daughter. After the court summoned the parties for mediation without success, Bo formally filed a lawsuit through lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Xiang Xun, and Peng Yuanxun. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Peng Shi of the First Special Court opened the Fourteenth Civil Court for hearing. Song Xueqin was absent, but his lawyer was present, stating that he had insufficient time to respond and requesting a postponement. After the plaintiff's lawyer stated the purpose of the lawsuit, the defendant's request was granted, and the hearing was rescheduled for July 13th.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Petition to the National Goods Promotion Association for Tax Exemption: Mao Lee Button Factory's Products Complete Tax Payment <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association stated that the No. 1 Manufacturing Plant of their factory member, Mao Lee Button Factory Co., Ltd., is located in Hankou. The semi-finished products are transported to Shanghai and sold abroad, requiring two tax payments, which creates a heavy burden. Yesterday, they specifically petitioned the Ministries of Industry and Finance, requesting tax exemption based on the precedents of European and American countries, to implement relief. The original petition is recorded as follows: A petition for a request: It is reported that our association member, Mao Lee Button Factory, stated in a letter: "Our country's manufactured buttons are exported and sold domestically and abroad. The increase in import taxes by European and American countries has greatly impacted our business, resulting in losses. The member's semi-finished product factory is located in Hankou. Its products are shipped to Shanghai, where taxes are paid according to regulations. Then, when shipped abroad, taxes must be paid again. Paying taxes twice on the same item creates a heavy burden and increases costs, making it difficult to compete with foreign goods. It has been found that semi-finished products are not taxed in European, American, and Japanese countries. Promoting sales is encouraged. National goods are in their infancy and in a state of economic downturn, making it difficult to sustain. Reluctantly, we request that your association petition the Ministries of Industry and Finance to approve a tax exemption for the member's semi-finished products shipped from Hankou to Shanghai and shipped abroad, in order to implement relief." Based on this, we hereby prepare this document and respectfully submit it to the ministries for review and approval, in accordance with the request. We request that the tax exemption for semi-finished buttons be approved, in order to maintain national goods and provide relief. We also hope for approval and adherence, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Principles for Allocating the Order of Ball Games <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The appropriate allocation of the order of ball games in this conference is closely related to the second, third, and fourth place finishes in various ball game championships. It is necessary to gather the opinions of all committee members and make appropriate allocations to benefit from collective wisdom and avoid any potential omissions. The following are some proposed principles for discussion so that the work of this section can have a basis for the future and avoid unexpected problems.</p>
<p>(1) Each committee member should, based on their personal opinion, select eight units with the best performance in each ball game championship and submit a list, signed and sealed, to this section by September 10th, according to their ideal order (the form will be issued by the conference).</p>
<p>(2) This section will summarize the results selected by each committee member and present the eight units with the most votes as a preparation for the seeding method.</p>
<p>(3) Among these eight units, the four units with more votes will be selected and randomly placed in the upper and lower sections of the draw, and the remaining four units will be drawn and arranged in the different sections using the same method (the above three items may also be handled by a competition committee designating five sub-groups, each headed by seven committee members, which is also acceptable).</p>
<p>(4) If there are units with the same number of votes, the order in the ideal list established by each committee member will be used as the standard for separate stages.</p>
<p>(5) According to the above rules, those who ideally obtain the right to the semi-finals have been completely arranged so that they will not meet in the first round of the competition. Then, the remaining units will be drawn and placed in the empty positions in the overall order.</p>
<p>(6) For the tennis match order, each unit will place one person each in the upper and lower sections of the draw, which will be determined by lottery. The allocation methods for the upper and lower sections of the singles matches and the distribution of doubles matches are exactly the same.</p>
<p>(7) If there are special circumstances, they will be submitted to the committee for joint decision at any time.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education previously responded to a request from the Henan Provincial Government, forwarded by the Provincial Department of Education, for an interpretation of the qualifications for elementary school teacher certification. The response stated that a university law degree does not meet the qualifications stipulated in Article 75 of the Elementary School Regulations and does not qualify one to serve as an elementary school principal. Furthermore, holding a university law degree and serving as a director of a mass education center for more than three years does not meet the qualifications stipulated in Clause 1 of Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations for Elementary School Teacher Certification and does not qualify one for certification without examination. Similarly, graduating from a secondary school or senior high school under the old system and serving as an elementary school teacher for less than one year does not meet the requirements of Clause 1 of Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations for Elementary School Teacher Certification and also does not qualify one for certification without examination. However, those with the above two qualifications may be certified through examination.</p>

<p>Shanghai Art College: This city's Shanghai Art College held a welcome ceremony for Principal Liu's return from abroad, as well as the 16th graduation ceremony of the new system and the first graduation ceremony of the affiliated Chengmei Middle School, yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the Yi Hai Tang hall.

<p>— (Xie Zhongwen)</p>
<p>There is an insurmountable boundary between persistence and rigidity, flexibility and superficiality. However, people often mistake persistence for rigidity and flexibility for superficiality, and thus the world is filled with stubborn people who "carve a mark on a boat to find a lost sword" and superficial people who "drift with the current." These two groups scold and attack each other. The weapons they wield are, for the former, the stone ax used by Pangu when he created the heavens and the earth—"persistence"; and for the latter, the golden cudgel obtained by the Monkey King when he stirred up the Crystal Palace—"flexibility." Their attacks almost always hit the other side's vital points.</p>
<p>In reality, persistence is not rigidity. Only those who know persistence but not flexibility are rigid. Flexibility is not superficiality. Only those who know flexibility but not persistence are superficial. Persistence should be unwavering effort under specific conditions of time and space, while flexibility is a way of coping when time and space conditions "change." Misusing persistence or flexibility without understanding the needs of the objective environment will definitely result in rigidity or superficiality.</p>
<p>There must be flexibility within persistence, and there must be persistence within flexibility. Persistence and flexibility are both essential methods for success.</p>

It is said that Xiong recently held a tea party to entertain guests and displayed the love letters he wrote during their courtship, as well as the "Lotus Lake Double Egret Picture" he painted, which is inscribed with the lyrics of "Sai Tian Xiang." The elegant sentiments are comparable to the previous song. I am recording it here to spread its fame:</p>
<p>"In white robes, swaying in the green waves, untouched by any mud. Elegant and upright, floating white feathers, they share a rarity in the world. As innocent playmates, flying tirelessly together, they are good friends who forget their age. Rosy cheeks and fragrant faces, a naturally created perfect couple. Feeling a myriad of tender emotions, equally pure and innocent, enjoying a blessed life. Soft words and charming frowns, immersed in intoxication, how fleeting is the sweet time! Even if it lasts for a long time, year after year, it is still sadly too short. Spending a lifetime under the flowers, morning and evening, inseparable."</p>
<p>I recently read Mr. Dong Shoujing's (Kang's) book "Records of Foreign Ships," which contains many amorous poems. I am excerpting his poem "Photography Sent to Yu Ji" to show a glimpse of his talent: "Harboring resentment, I would rather mutilate this life, without deleting the frivolous affairs and leisure feelings. The recluse of Fragrant Mountain should concede to me in one matter, leaving behind a reputation of unfaithfulness in old age. I seek old titles in the snail-shell wall draped with gauze. My lofty aspirations have turned to ashes, tired of hearing the cock crow. The bracelet often encircles the dreamer's arm, borrowing the duckweed of the West as the world of the West."</p>
<p>People generally assume that legal scholars like Mr. Dong, who is hailed as a sage, are dignified and stern, enforcing the law without compassion. Little do they know that this old man's romantic feelings are quite profound, integrating emotions and legal principles into one. Mr. Xiong is a later example!</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Problem of Entertainment for Shanghai Housewives <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>In Shanghai, every family with a decent financial situation employs at least one amah. All the tasks of sweeping, wiping, washing, and housework are undertaken by the amah. Therefore, the work undertaken by housewives is no more than bearing and raising children for their husbands. (After the children are born, the responsibility of feeding and caring for them is usually borne by a wet nurse). If one is willing to go to the kitchen at noon to hold a kitchen knife and cook, one is already considered very frugal.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think the problem of entertainment for housewives in Shanghai is not easy to solve, because at least ten hours or more of the day's twenty-four hours are free.</p>
<p>Based on my cold observation, the most common way for housewives to pass the time is to get together with four people, whether it's the friendly neighbor across the street, the Ningbo aunt next door, or even a last-minute "second-in-command" pulled from the end of the alley when they are one person short, and play twelve or sixteen rounds of mahjong. If they really can't form a game, then they won't let the time go to waste. They'll drag the Wang sister-in-law from the side room or the Zhang mother from the pavilion to see a movie or listen to a story at a storytelling house. If there happens to be no good movies today or they don't feel like going out, then there's no other way but to go to a neighbor's house and chat with another housewife, from the husband's frugality to the length of the cheongsam, all the way to discussing the shortcomings of a certain sister-in-law. If they don't even feel like doing that, then they can turn on the radio, smoke a cigarette, and listen to a few trendy jokes to relieve some boredom. If they find that still boring, then they can lie on the sofa and sleep for a while, getting enough energy to go out and play with their husband in the evening, or to argue with their husband.</p>
<p>Every day, housewives are busy like this, no wonder every housewife is always shouting "I'm exhausted."</p>

<p>Episode 15: Sincere Words and Earnest Advice Don't Fall on Deaf Ears, the Sound of Money and the Shadows of Lamps Piteously Sell People</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Hu squinted her eyes and smiled, "I wanted to talk about your master a long time ago, but you didn't want to. Now your master is thinking about it again." Zhichien repeatedly shook his head and smiled, "No, no, no, it's not like that. We heard that someone wants to buy this girl and take her away, but they won't support her grandmother and her mother, letting them be separated from their flesh and blood. Is there such a thing?" Sister-in-law Hu said, "Isn't that the idea of the old Master Jia! He said that he wanted the girl to be his concubine, just to make himself happy. What's the use of him having these two old women? So he's only willing to pay 150 yuan to buy the girl." Beihai was sitting by a tea table against the wall. Hearing these words, he immediately raised his fist and pounded on the tea table. With a "dong" sound, a teacup on top of the table fell to the ground and shattered. Sister-in-law Hu was so frightened that she cried out and dared not say any more. The waiter brought in the lamp and asked what happened. Zhichien smiled, "Nothing happened. The room is a bit dark, and this Mr. Wang knocked over the tea table." Beihai realized afterwards that he had been reckless, so he didn't say anything more. Zhichien said, "Such a big girl, and a good person, selling her for 150 yuan is too cheap. Speaking of which, she's your niece. Your married sister has only this one child, and there's also an old woman with white hair above her, who is also hoping that this girl will provide a way out. If she dies, she'll also rely on this girl to bury her. If you plan like this, 150 yuan is like cutting them alive. Who will these two widows rely on in the future? If this girl follows someone named Jia to Jiangnan, who knows what will happen. She has no relatives and no friends, and if she suffers injustice, there's no place to find someone to help. To put it bluntly, this 150 yuan is probably a life. There's no shortage of ways to accumulate virtue in this world, and besides, this is still your close relative." (251)</p>
<h3 id="e206">Records of Imperial Incense <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager turned her head to look at him and said impatiently:</p>
<p>"Quickly summon several people who work in the Imperial Hospital!"</p>
<p>In fact, as soon as Li Lianying knew that Her Old Ladyship was feeling unwell, he had already automatically sent people to summon the imperial physicians. At that time, the court, like in previous dynasties, had an Imperial Hospital, headed by the Grand Physician, a high-ranking official of the first or second rank. Under the Grand Physician were the Deputy Physician and the Imperial Physicians; their ranks also had several levels, and the higher ones were simply not below my father. Although they were generally doctors who read medical books and discussed medical cases, they were very different from the doctors outside, because they also had a belly full of specialized knowledge for serving the emperor! Since they were all high-ranking officials, they naturally had very complete official uniforms: red hats, coral beads, (engraved) peacock feather plumes, and a very beautiful court robe. Since I entered the inner palace, I had seen almost all kinds of people: only these Imperial Physicians had I not had the opportunity to meet. Therefore, I was also eager to see them and to see how the Empress Dowager would let them examine her. At this time, I couldn't help but secretly rejoice, thanks to the Empress Dowager's special thought of me, summoning me from when I was not on duty, so that I could have the honor of witnessing this grand occasion.</p>
<p>Because Li Lianying had already summoned these Imperial Physicians, it was only two or three minutes after the Empress Dowager's decree that four elderly gentlemen from the Imperial Hospital walked in one after another. The Empress Dowager was leaning back on a relatively low throne, still coughing, but her posture was still very dignified, accepting the homage of these four Imperial Physicians without moving at all. Normally, when examining a patient, the first step for doctors is always to look at the patient's complexion; however, how could these four Imperial Physicians dare to look at the Empress Dowager directly? They never dared to raise their heads. (351)</p>
<h3 id="e207">Attending a Banquet <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>I, who rarely socialize outside, unexpectedly received a invitation from a friend, which read: "Respectfully invite you to come to the ×× Restaurant at 6:00 PM on the ×th day of the month for a get-together."</p>
<p>I often see people in the newspapers scolding the Chinese for their bad habit of not being punctual. Afraid of being scolded, I arrived early. When the clock on the Jianghai Customs House pointed to 5:55, I rushed to the restaurant.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the restaurant, I saw the seven large white characters "Mr. Wang of the Hall is Hosting a Feast" written in a red-bottomed glass frame. So I strode in. The waiter, with a surprised look, led me to the hall upstairs. Although six round tables had been set up in the hall, with cups, chopsticks, fruits, and cold dishes placed on them, it was deserted and there wasn't a single person to be found.</p>
<p>"Where's Mr. Wang?" I couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang always arrives close to 7:00 PM when he hosts a feast," the waiter replied, inviting me to wipe my face, smoke, drink tea, and sit down.</p>
<p>After finishing a cigarette, it was 6:15, and the host still hadn't arrived, nor had a single guest. So I lit another cigarette and smoked it. I waited until 6:50 when Mr. Wang finally came, repeatedly cupping his hands and saying, "Sorry to keep you waiting, sorry to keep you waiting." But I had to say quickly, "I just arrived, I just arrived."</p>
<p>It was 7:30, and only about forty guests had arrived, far from filling the six tables. But I was already ravenously hungry, and sparks were flying before my eyes. I couldn't wait to escape and buy a few pan-fried buns to satisfy my hunger.</p>
<p>It was almost 8:00 when a dozen more people arrived. So Mr. Wang spoke, saying, "Let's sit down first."</p>
<p>I felt like I had received an imperial decree and was just about to take my seat, but before I could, someone sitting next to me抢着抢着搶着抢着搶着抢着搶着搶着搶着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着搶着抢着搶着抢着抢着搶着抢着搶着抢着搶着抢着搶着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着搶着抢着抢着搶着抢着搶着抢着抢着抢着搶着抢着搶着抢着抢着搶着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着搶着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着抢着</p>

<h3 id="e208">Graduation Ceremonies at Various Schools <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Art College: The Shanghai Art College in this city held a ceremony yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the Yi Hai Tang hall to welcome Principal Liu's return from abroad, as well as the 16th graduation ceremony of the new system and the first graduation ceremony of the affiliated Chengmei Middle School. The event was attended by City Party Headquarters representative Wang Longzhang, City Education Bureau representative Nie Haifan, Chairman of the Board Cai Yuanpei, Principal Liu Haisu, Vice Principal Wang Jiyuan, as well as over 500 faculty, staff, students, and guests. After formal greetings, Vice Principal Wang delivered an opening speech and welcomed Principal Liu. Principal Liu then reported on his experiences in Europe. Afterwards, Chairman Cai Yuanpei presented diplomas to the college graduates, and Board Member Cao Qiming presented diplomas to the graduates of the affiliated Chengmei Middle School. Cai also delivered a speech filled with encouragement. Representatives from Party and government organizations and various board members then gave speeches. Guests Kong Keda and Si Xiaoru delivered speeches. Afterwards, a student representative gave a closing speech and the ceremony ended.</p>
<p>Shanghai University School of Commerce: The City Center campus of the Shanghai University School of Commerce held its graduation ceremony yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM at the New Tian'an Church. Principal Liu presided over the ceremony and reported on the purpose of the meeting. Dean Zhu delivered a speech. Lin Kanghou and He Dehui were invited to speak on "A Review of Commercial Decline," after which diplomas were presented. That evening, the school also held an annual banquet at the Hong Kong Road Banking Club.</p>
<p>Soochow University: Since Principal Yang Yongqing of Soochow University in Suzhou went to the United States to lecture earlier this month, the school's affairs have been managed by Dean Pan Shenming, and everything remains as before. New professors for the next semester include Shen Qinglai, Si Shimisi, and Gu Yidong. The school will hold its graduation ceremony on the 29th of this month. This year's graduating class includes over 100 students from the departments of Arts, Science, and Law, and over 60 students from the middle school. The speaker will be Liu Zhanen, the principal of Shanghai University, who is also an alumnus of the school. Recognizing that the number of girls' high schools in the province is less than one-fifth of the number of boys' high schools, and to meet the need to provide girls with equal educational opportunities, the middle school will reduce the number of first-year male students to two classes starting in the fall semester, allocating one class to enroll female students, totaling 40 people. The male and female students will attend separate classes. New dormitories and gymnasiums for the female students are currently under construction and will be ready for use when school starts, it is said.</p>
<p>Huizhong Middle School: Huizhong Middle School in the west Douduo Bridge area of this city has been established for over 40 years and has been officially registered. Zhang Dongmin, a returned student with a bachelor's degree and former professor at Guanghua University, has been hired as the principal. Principal Zhang is a graduate of the school. This year's graduation ceremonies for the senior high, junior high, and affiliated elementary school will be held simultaneously on the 28th of this month. Dr. Ou Yuanhuai of Great China University has been specially invited to deliver a speech. The school will establish a summer tutoring program this year, with classes for senior high, junior high, and elementary school levels. Classes will start on July 7th, and both male and female students will be accepted. Boarding is available. Applications have been very enthusiastic recently.</p>

<p>— (Xie Zhongwen)</p>
<p>There is an insurmountable boundary between persistence and rigidity, flexibility and superficiality. However, people often mistake persistence for rigidity and flexibility for superficiality, and thus the world is filled with stubborn people who "carve a mark on a boat to find a lost sword" and superficial people who "drift with the current." These two groups scold and attack each other. The weapons they wield are, for the former, the stone ax used by Pangu when he created the heavens and the earth—"persistence"; and for the latter, the golden cudgel obtained by the Monkey King when he stirred up the Crystal Palace—"flexibility." Their attacks almost always hit the other side's vital points.</p>
<p>In reality, persistence is not rigidity. Only those who know persistence but not flexibility are rigid. Flexibility is not superficiality. Only those who know flexibility but not persistence are superficial. Persistence should be unwavering effort under specific conditions of time and space, while flexibility is a way of coping when time and space conditions "change." Misusing persistence or flexibility without understanding the needs of the objective environment will definitely result in rigidity or superficiality.</p>
<p>There must be flexibility within persistence, and there must be persistence within flexibility. Persistence and flexibility are both essential methods for success.</p>

It is said that Xiong recently held a tea party to entertain guests and displayed the love letters he wrote during their courtship, as well as the "Lotus Lake Double Egret Picture" he painted, which is inscribed with the lyrics of "Sai Tian Xiang." The elegant sentiments are comparable to the previous song. I am recording it here to spread its fame:</p>
<p>"In white robes, swaying in the green waves, untouched by any mud. Elegant and upright, floating white feathers, they share a rarity in the world. As innocent playmates, flying tirelessly together, they are good friends who forget their age. Rosy cheeks and fragrant faces, a naturally created perfect couple. Feeling a myriad of tender emotions, equally pure and innocent, enjoying a blessed life. Soft words and charming frowns, immersed in intoxication, how fleeting is the sweet time! Even if it lasts for a long time, year after year, it is still sadly too short. Spending a lifetime under the flowers</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to foreign telegrams from London, both near and far term decreased to 625. It was said that the market was firm after closing, and the US bought at the closing price. Local speculators raised it by 125 for trading. The price of silver remained unchanged. The forward silver price in Montreux remained unchanged and rose by various amounts.

After the opening, banks seized the opportunity to sell aggressively, and the process gradually hardened. The HSBC's listed price was announced, with the British Pound rising by 0.125 and the US Dollar rising by 0.3125. It seemed difficult to maintain for a while, but because banks took advantage of the low prices to hedge, the psychology of Chinese merchants was dazed. Therefore, although the Central Bank blocked, HSBC and 沙邇 still pulled back to tighten. Later, because the Jewish merchant 喬直甫 tended to sell out, it was difficult to tighten. At noon, the process was uncertain and revolved around the Hong Kong market. In the afternoon, banks blocked the British Pound and bought the US Dollar, but it was difficult to tighten because the Indian Silver Bank telegraphed for the first time that it would rise by six annas. Later, the Japanese Bank 住友 suddenly came to buy and settle, and the process tightened. However, banks took advantage of the high prices to sell out. The Indian Silver Bank telegraphed for the second time without changes. The final situation was still flat.

The US Dollar was 39.875 yuan, which was flat compared to the previous closing price for both the British and US currencies.

<h3 id="e212">Securities: Delivery of June Public Bonds and its Process <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The Total Delivery Amount Exceeds 50 Million Yuan, and There are also 40 to 50 Million Yuan Outside the Market. Financial Situation is Under Pressure. The Downward Trend is Fierce, and Low Prices are Frequently Seen.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for the June futures of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The market trading was suspended as usual, and only the collection and settlement matters of the brokers were handled. The total delivery amount was 50,011,000 yuan. Excluding 30,012,000 yuan for the brokers' mutual clearing and settlement, the actual delivery by the exchange was 19,999,000 yuan. It was said that the number of off-market delivery was as high as 40 to 50 million yuan. The participants were all powerful figures. The largest volume of delivery was from No. 4, which was said to be sold on behalf of a certain savings association, accounting for more than 10 million yuan. The numbers of 69 and 48 were also very considerable. The most purchases were from 16, 54 and 72. The arbitrage volume also reached tens of millions of yuan. Such smooth transactions are rare in the public debt market. The June futures were launched on April 27 and stopped on June 24. The process was turbulent and extremely turbulent. The intensity of the changes can be said to be the most eventful this year. At the beginning, due to the stable environment and financial stability, the various groups of retailers did not dare to engage in short selling. The multi-party also thought that the market price was already high, and most bonds were above 70% or 80% discount, so they were unwilling to absorb as much as possible. Only retail transactions were more active, and the market suddenly lost its driving force, so it was stagnant and dull for more than a month. During this period, although large households frequently supplied, the retail absorption capacity was still quite strong due to the stable environment, and the market was able to stabilize for a while. However, when the financial tide rose, 明華美豐 successively closed down, and the silver supply suddenly tightened. In order to maintain themselves, the banks sold their bonds one after another to cash in. The banks' arbitrage also stopped, and the chips suddenly felt loose. Although the retail investors wanted to maintain it with effort, their appetite was already satisfied. Therefore, the dull market situation for a month finally collapsed. Later, the situation in the north became turbulent again, which further fueled the selling trend in the market. The selling wind became stronger, and the prices of various bonds fell by more than two boards. The salt tax treasury bonds fell to 48.5 yuan, the 22nd customs fell to 50.06 yuan, the 23rd customs fell to 59.2 yuan, and the gold short fell to 68.2 yuan. At that time, the atmosphere on the platform was so bad that there seemed to be no end to the fall. Later, the situation in North China stabilized, which triggered short covering. The collapse of the 寧波實業 and 江甫 banks made the market air weak again. Later, the situation fluctuated indefinitely due to the tightening of the northern situation. On the last day of this month, the No. 4 sold millions of real goods, and the market situation struggled even more. The comparison table of clearing and transaction numbers for June delivery is listed on the left. (Unit: 100 yuan) Today, August futures are launched.</p>

It is not known whether the Gaines Gold faction's attempt to attach a gold clause to the heavy taxation of wealthy households will succeed. The market was still stable in the morning. American Radio created this year's high record. Small exchange stocks also fell. The bond market was mixed and weak under the leadership of railway and public utility bonds.

<p>After the sharp fall in the yarn market the day before, it is now stable, but spot yarn trading is quite sparse. Customers are restricted by the tight money supply, and their purchasing power is weak. In addition, foreign yarn is sold at reduced prices, and Chinese yarn is greatly hit. However, some of them have a dry base, pulled in to do more, and the package amount is also huge. However, judging from the general trend, the selling price of foreign yarn is too cheap after all.</p>
<p>Watch and See Cotton Yarn Trading</p>
<p>When the standard yarn market opened in the morning, the prices for each month showed a sluggish and weak trend again. Both the bulls and bears in the market are watching and seeing, and the situation is scattered. After a slight increase in one round, the prices returned to decline after three closings. As a result, the prices for each month increased by 1, 2, and 4 jiao. The market was still dull and lifeless when it opened in the afternoon. It was said that the spot yarn transaction was only 336 bales, and the prices of foreign yarn were still weak. As a result, the prices were nearly flat, and the distant prices increased by 1 jiao. It was found that Jin Chang sold 300 bales, Ming De sold 500 bales, Zhen Da sold 500 bales, He Xing sold 750 bales, Tai Chang sold 500 bales, Run Kang sold 400 bales, Tong He sold 300 bales, Yu Da sold 700 bales, and Sen Kang sold 300 bales.

<p>It is Rumored That Major Buyers and Sellers are All Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>The sound of squeezing shorts is very high in the cotton market in July and August. It is said that Japanese merchants are in a bull position. However, at a time when there is sufficient cotton in storage, textile factories are closing down from time to time. The financial situation is so tight. According to people in the cotton industry, a certain Japanese merchant firm has a short position of 100,000 dan, and a certain Japanese merchant firm has a long position of 80,000 dan. The two major buyers and sellers are both foreign merchants.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Slightly Covers Shorts</p>
<p>When the standard cotton market opened in the morning, the prices for each month showed an increasing trend again. After the sharp fall the day before, the shorts actively covered their positions, and the market atmosphere tightened. Some bulls did not release their close positions, and the shorts had no intention of selling. The market situation showed a stalemate again. As a result, the prices for each month increased by 1 or 2 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. The market was flat when it opened in the afternoon. When shooting to the third closing price, the near months were more expensive, and there was still an air of short squeezing in the market. As a result, the prices increased by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared with the closing price in the morning, and the distant months were flat. It was found that Yi Yu sold 1,000 dan, Sui Long sold 1,000 dan, Jun Chang sold 900 dan, Tong He sold 700 dan, He Xing sold 700 dan, Yi Feng sold 1,000 dan, Yu Da sold 1,600 dan, and Yi Chang sold 1,300 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened weak due to poor news from Liverpool and good weather. Then it returned due to the prediction of rain and the strong wheat market. All transactions were concentrated in the July term. There were long positions closed, small price increases sold, and short positions covered. Traders bought in at falling prices. Finally, brokers covered short positions. There was a great lack of new transactions. Traders are waiting for developments in Washington. The July term delivery notice was only 100 bales. The closing was firm. Spot goods increased by 5 pounds old, and futures increased by 3 to 9 pounds old. British cotton spot goods remained unchanged, and futures increased by 1 point. Indian cotton was initially firm due to bulk retail purchases, but then returned due to long position closings. Ping Guo Er increased by 1.25 to 1.75 rupees, Ao Mu La increased by 0.5 to 1.25 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi increased by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 26th).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market turned to a downward trend again. The quotation for foreign wheat in Chicago had risen by about 4 or 5 jiao, and the price of Canadian wheat rose by 1 or 2 jiao. Therefore, the initial opening price this month was as high as 0.55 yuan. When shooting for the far term, factories such as 　豐 sold quite smoothly because the wheat price in the producing area was trending lower, and the goods were also prosperous due to rain. People's hearts were also affected by this. However, the transaction was only about 180,000 bags, which was not very concerned. When the market opened in the afternoon, the initial market was not good because the factories still had to seize and sell, but then the Yingkou gang bought in, and the market gradually stabilized again. This month, the market atmosphere is relaxed because of the tight money supply and the approaching delivery date. However, the spot goods of each factory still need to be increased by 0.05 yuan. As a result, this month fell by 0.02 yuan, July fell by 0.0115 yuan, August fell by 0.01 yuan, May fell by 0.0025 yuan, October fell by 0.005 yuan, and November had no change.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the transaction in the futures wheat market was still active in the morning, but the price was slightly lower. Because the new wheat from the producing area has been arriving in large numbers since the river channel was unblocked, and people are naturally looking low in the face of the current tight money supply. People's hearts in the industry are not as stable as before. Those who have goods slightly sell short, and the asking price is loosened by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, the transaction was silent again. Because foreign wheat is quoted to rise and the new chips in the market have not increased much, the market presents a stalemate. As a result, July fell by 0.02 yuan, August fell by 0.04 yuan, October fell by 0.01 yuan, and the spot wheat market is stabilizing. Nearly 10,000 bags of wheat have arrived by ship and car, and the factories still have a certain capacity, so the asking price is stable. The 明光 Zhangbaling wheat in 　管店 is 3.46 yuan, the 　州 wheat is 2.434 yuan, the Wuyi wheat is 3.4 yuan, second is 0.4 yuan, the Danyang Gaozi Zhenjiang wheat is 3.36 yuan, the Daqiao wheat is 3.42 yuan, the Jiangxinzhou wheat is 3.38 yuan, second is 0.36 yuan, the Wuxi wheat is 3.4 yuan, the Yangzhou wheat is 3.345 yuan, the Nanjing and Zhou wheat is 3.3234 yuan, the Penglai Taicang wheat is 3.37 yuan, the Bacheng wheat is 3.44 yuan, the Anting wheat is 3.36 yuan, the Nantang wheat is 3.38 yuan, the Tangshi wheat is 3.43 yuan, the Kunshan wheat is 3.4 yuan, second is 3.9 yuan, the Wusong wheat is 3.19 yuan. Fuxin went to 7,000 bags, Fufeng went to 4,000 bags, Shenda went to 1,500 bags, and Xinda went to 1,200 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Rice Prices Repeatedly Plunge <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of rice in Hu Nan, Shanghai, were still only 17 or 18 (a total of more than 3,000 dan), but because the sales market was not good, the market color was still sluggish. Visually, the people's hearts are scattered, the market is lifeless, and it seems that it is still difficult to have a turnaround. Therefore, if the prices of each thick japonica rice continue to fall by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan, and although each late rice was packaged yesterday and the Qingdao gang moved slightly, it was only more than 300 bags, so its price also fell again by 0.01 yuan or so. The various varieties such as Yinyuan and Shejian also followed. Yesterday, there were more than a dozen sources from the rivers in Hu Bei, Shanghai. The various sources in the market rushed to offer high prices for white japonica rice, and the medium and secondary sources continued to take them, and the price of high-quality goods was cut by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan, and the medium and secondary goods were repaired by several points to nearly 0.1 yuan. The afternoon market turned stable, and there were a few scattered early rice transactions, and the price was fixed. Although not many Bai Yuan arrived, the sales were still repaired by 0.1 yuan with the price, and the various goods were peaceful.</p>
<p>The market situation of foreign rice yesterday, this 　 went to 　　活　in the middle, there seemed to be a lively atmosphere, because in addition to the two gangs in this street continuing to purchase, there were also the Jiujiang and Hankou openings of the Yangtze River gang, and the Yangtze River area was afraid of excessive rainfall and might become unpredictable, so it was quite intentional to do the installation quickly. However, the silver supply was too tight yesterday, and the incoming households could not purchase as much as possible, and the cargo owners and hoarders had an eager heart to sell. Therefore, the price of No. 3 Saigon and Wenzhou rice was 0.05 yuan, and others were also in a flat position. The city opened 5,380 bags of Xijia rice, 1,700 bags of small twisted rice, 700 bags of 致黨, 500 bags of Siamese rice, and 400 bags of Wenzhou rice, most of which were purchased by the local gangs in the inland. The Yangtze River gang only dealt with it slightly. There is no good image in the future market for the time being, and it can only be gradually expanded if the passenger gangs sell well.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean cake market situation turned 　 again, because the inland sales market gradually developed, and the factories did not have much spot goods. Delivery must be scheduled in advance and delivered when the date is reached, and people's hearts can't help but turn stable. I heard that even the telegram is scheduled, and the air in the market is also looking for liveliness. Therefore, the price of Changde Factory's four-brand cake in the afternoon has opened at 1.131 yuan, and the market price has risen compared to the previous day. The price of Dayou Factory's four-brand opened at 1.128 yuan, the price of Dade New Factory's four-brand opened at 1.1185 yuan, and the price of Shunyu Factory's four-brand also opened at 1.1285 yuan, with a total transaction of 11,500 pieces. The price of Sui Feng Factory's official brand cake opened at 1.15 yuan, and 500 pieces were traded. At this moment, the trend of the cake is due to the season, so the changes in the future are infinite, and there is little certainty.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 抽芯珍眉 green tea of the 夾路庄 was purchased by 恊和 and 同孚 and other firms, and the transaction was not deserted. Chinese tea merchants believed that the market's existing base was dry and the source was not sufficient, and people's hearts were tight, and 針　秀眉 and other 　　were also sold quite a lot yesterday. The high-end goods on the Wuyuan and Tunxi roads 　were popular. The low-end green tea on the Zhuang soil, Zhuang Wenzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo and other roads 　the road is still sluggish.</p>

<p>The market for woolen fabrics was still flat yesterday (Thursday), and the Public Welfare Association was very idle. However, the 36-inch wide white single-mouth glued cloth of Japanese products was quite active in sales. Large and small Western-style clothing gangs in Beijing, Jiangsu, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai purchase retail and wholesale every day, and there are many 　who make uniforms for large gangs and military schools. Yesterday, the original box of this white glued cloth (　ten pieces) was sold for 0.485 yuan per yard, and the zero piece (more than 40 yards in length) was sold for 0.52 yuan per yard. A uniform price of 0.5566 yuan was charged for zero-star cutting, and all transactions required cash.</p>

<p>The recent transactions of thick tinplate have been smooth, because yarn factories, toy factories, and 棧　factories have all added to their purchases. Therefore, the bottom goods are increasingly scarce, and there are fewer arrivals from foreign countries. As a result, those who hold the goods have a firm mind, so the 　price　is firmly inserted. The details of each variety are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(No. 24) Each box accounts for 62 yuan, and the transaction reaches 15 or 16 boxes, which are sold by the Hongkou gang. It is found that there are only a dozen boxes of this product in the local area of Shanghai, and the next batch of arrivals is far away. People's hearts are firm and the market atmosphere is solid, and the market outlook is optimistic.</p>
<p>(No. 26) Although recent transactions are not as active as No. 24, the quantity of goods is extremely small, and people's hearts are very strong. The market price of each box is 512 yuan. Yesterday, three or four boxes were traded, which were purchased by toy factories.</p>

At that time, there were more than ten contributors. Liang Qichao, Di Pingzi, and Wu Yanren all had their own works. In the first issue, Qichao also wrote an introduction, pointing out that this was "a work unprecedented in China."</p>
<p>Liang Qichao's views on fiction were insightful. The most important point was to point out the major key to literary evolution: "from the literature of ancient language to the literature of the vernacular," and that fiction "cannot be skillfully written in the literary style of ancient language," as well as the relationship between fiction and social governance, so-called "If you want to improve social governance, you must start with the revolution of fiction; if you want to renew the people, you must start with new fiction" (On the Relationship Between Fiction and Social Governance). He discussed "The Peach Blossom Fan" extensively, elevating it to a condition of nationalism. In another section, he also mentioned that the earliest work to discuss fiction from a new perspective in the late Qing Dynasty was the more than ten thousand words of Yan Jidao and Bieshi (unknown if it is Xia Huiqing?) in the "Attached Publication of Fiction Preface" in the Tianjin Guowen Bao. It is a pity that this article cannot be found today.</p>
<p>The second is Pingzi. His discussion of fiction even places it on par with the classics, saying that it "has the function of mutual assistance with the classics," and can "change people's hearts and improve society." The impact is not limited to "women and coarse people" (Xia Huiqing's words). He said, "Confucius's deletion of poems in those days was to improve fiction and improve songs, that is, to improve society," and that "poetry is the ancestor of fiction, and Confucius is the ancestor of novelists." He believes that "If you want to improve society, you must first improve songs; if you want to improve songs, you must first improve fiction." In his discussion of books, he combines "The Golden Lotus" and "Water Margin," using a social life perspective as the argument, which is quite appropriate, and can be said to be a very bold and novel argument at the time. There is a discussion on ballad novels. There is a discussion on "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," calling it a nationalist work, saying that many places that originally attacked the Manchus were deleted when it was printed. And he discusses "Dream of the Red Chamber" extensively, saying that it is a work of "resentment against the Manchus." In summary, his arguments have many strengths, but the shortcoming is that they cannot be objective.</p>
<p>Xia Ren (unknown who this is) wrote a lengthy defense of "Dream of the Red Chamber," arguing that it is not an obscene book, but a very valuable social novel, political novel, ethical novel, philosophical novel, and moral novel, and made factual extensions. His conclusion is that the book "Dream of the Red Chamber" is actually "using the vision of a great philosopher to destroy and cleanse the old morality," attacking "the old society" and dark politics. He compares Cao Xueqin with Gong Ding'an, calling them "the two great thinkers of the last hundred years." Although what he said is true, it is still difficult to avoid the suspicion of exaggeration.</p>
<p>Ding Yi's work discusses "Water Margin" in the most detail, and his argument is also the most radical. He said that this book is "the sprout of independence and self-reliance and advocating democracy and civil rights," and said that Shi Nai'an's writing of this was based on two kinds of doctrines, one is "democracy and civil rights," and the other is: "Because foreign tribes broke into the Central Plains, he deeply felt the disaster of national subjugation," and wrote this to "promote martial virtue, invigorate the spirit of chivalry, as the starting point for repelling foreigners." This kind of argument cannot avoid the disease of subjective fantasy, but it is quite representative of the most common tendency in fiction criticism at that time.</p>
<p>Bathed in Blood, Manchu, also has good works, but because they have no special characteristics, they are omitted. Wu Yanren's works have four sections, which are combined into "Monthly Fiction" "Speaking of Fiction" (1906) for discussion. "New Fiction" was published for a total of two years, and "Collections of Short Stories" were almost published in every issue. "Monthly Fiction" occasionally published them, but among the discussions of fiction, only Wu Yanren's works have something to commend.</p>
<p>The works of Zhou Guisheng, the host of Zhixin Studio, and Tao Baopi are mostly criticisms of contemporary new works and translations. Such as Zhou's "Critique of Hu Shiyu" and Tao's "Critique of New Story of the Stone" and "Sea of ​​Hate," although they also have their merits, they cannot avoid the disease of exaggeration and supporting friends (Wu Yanren), which is far inferior to "Collections of Short Stories."</p>
<p>The best ones are several essays on fiction outside of "Speaking of Fiction." Such as Tian Lusheng's "On the Relationship Between Fiction and Improving Society," "History of Chinese Fiction Through the Ages," "On the Three Greatest Chinese Novelists Fei," "Education in the Theater," etc., either describe the development of the history of Chinese fiction, or talk about the social retribution of fiction, or comment on writers, or advocate reforming the old drama. The thoughts and propositions all show that they were the most progressive at the time.</p>
<p>There is also an essay "Preface to Monthly Fiction Series," written by Lu Liangcheng, which is thousands of words long and is simply an outstanding history of Chinese fiction. From ancient times to modern times, it involves no less than hundreds of kinds of fiction, and also includes commentary, with quite progressive views. Among the works on fiction at that time, it is almost only Huang Tangxi's "Small Talks on Fiction" The recollection of old fiction in one section can be compared with it. It relies on this to compete with "Collections of Short Stories." But I don't know if this Tian Lusheng and Lu Liangcheng really exist?</p>
<h3 id="e225">Germination Fifty Years <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Libo</p>
<p>Zola's "Germination," written in 1884-85, has already had the glorious life of being enthusiastically read for fifty years. It is said that the French publishing industry held a fiftieth anniversary celebration of its birth this year.</p>
<p>This anniversary is worthy of our response.</p>
<p>We know that "Germination" is the first novel about the suffering of workers made with the artist's scientific wisdom. It is the most faithful reflection of the situation of European workers at the end of the century, leaving an artistic record of all the characteristics of the early movement. It is a worker, so it is no coincidence that this book has always been loved by people from publication to the present.</p>
<p>Before starting to write "Germination," the author lived in the coal mines of northern France and Belgium for six months, breathing the suffocating gas-filled air with the workers, and understanding the details of their inner and outer lives. The descriptions of the daily lives of the workers in his book, the tragedies of coal mine collapses, etc., are almost all based on reality, but they are also mixed with the inner feelings of the workers, thus forming the sublime mood of a narrative poem.</p>
<p>Comparing "Germination" with Sinclair's "The Coal King," which deals with the same theme, makes it even more evident the former's unattainable sublimity. "The Coal King's thinking is external, and the protagonist is a playful young master." The protagonist of "Germination," Etienne, is the most radical young worker.</p>
<p>Etienne is indeed a typical worker leader. He has infinite vitality, a thirst for knowledge, and a deep affection for his companions. He gains the trust of all miners. However, when he first appeared on the scene, he also had the lightness of youth. He believed that the realization of justice was only a matter of months; he believed that after a long kiss, the happiness of all mankind could come.</p>
<p>With the unfolding of the facts of the mining incident, Zola also developed the psychological progress of all the characters. This is the essence of "Germination" and one of its immortal characteristics. Reality contains the richest educational meaning. Zola knew how to cure the mental illnesses of his characters and correct their fatal mistakes.</p>
<p>When leaving the coal mine, Etienne was full of hope. In the joy of this new season, he looked around. He began to think of himself. Through the unbearable and arduous experience of the coal mine, he felt strong. "His education is complete." Like a trained soldier in the forward movement, he would be fully armed and move forward. He heard the song of the lark, and saw the color of the dawn at the end of the century illuminated by the great fire of justice. Soon, the sun of April rose into the sky, radiating all its brilliance, warming this pregnant earth. From her nurturing embrace, life re-erupted, small buds turned into emerald green, and the fields swayed with sprouting grass. Seeds are swelling, growing, and breaking through the earth everywhere in the pursuit of light and heat... People are growing up, rising up, demanding the harvest of the next century, and soon, that germination will break through this great earth.</p>
<p>Such a moving narrative prophecy really inspires people's emotions. Perhaps the greatness of "Germination" lies here!</p>

<h3 id="e227">Scolding the Chicken <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Ouyang Fan Hai</p>
<p>——Do you still have so much strength to scold people?</p>
<p>——Not scold? These damned bastards! Hey! Eating my chicken!</p>
<p>……Let it be,……You rest for a while</p>
<p>The old woman sat down in front of him.</p>
<p>——Spring is almost over! We're really getting old fast, Fourth Sister-in-law!</p>
<p>——Hmph……You're still in good shape (healthy)! I wish you well, old man!</p>
<p>——Don't scold anymore……What are you arguing about when you're old? I don't care about anything now, I just feel that our days are passing too quickly, we're getting old too quickly! I almost want to cry when I think of when I was young (young)!</p>
<p>——The more I think about it, the more sad I get! I've been raising my chicken for three years.</p>
<p>——Don't you think about our old days?</p>
<p>——We really should think about it, I remember when I was a little girl……But where's my chicken?</p>
<p>——Yes, you haven't forgotten, have you! Didn't we say……to here.—His words were blown away by a gust of spring breeze. The fragrance from the fields blew into his nose, but the green mountains, the green velvety wilderness, the small flowers scattered among the high and low thorn bushes, and the golden sun, all the scenery of spring only reflected a hazy and unclear impression on his old brain membrane. Water was constantly flowing from his reddened eye, and he tried hard to concentrate, only to see a white shiny path dragging under his feet. His conversational opponent, the one he called Fourth Sister-in-law, was a seventy-four-year-old, yet still healthy, thin as a firewood stick old woman. She sat on a stone pier under a sky lantern post opposite him. This stone pier under the sky lantern post at the entrance of the village, she had sat on it and left a butt print of her own, no one knows how many times she had sat on it. Moreover, this stone pier under the sky lantern post is a memorial that the two of them will never forget. The old man, who is sixty-six years old, strained his eyes and wiped the water flowing from his eyes with a knife, as if eager to see the seventy-four-year-old woman opposite him. He smiled, his face full of wrinkles, and his high and wide forehead still flashed the intelligence of his youth. His mouth trembled slightly with a smile, and his lips moved gently, showing that he was completely immersed in a sweet memory, and the memory itself was obviously painful, making him very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>——Can't you see anything in your eyes?</p>
<p>——I can't see almost anything. I really want to see your face, Fourth Sister-in-law! I can only see that your face is a yellowish blur, I can't see your nose and mouth and eyes clearly! I really hate it, ah! If I could see your face again, how happy I would be!</p>
<p>——I hope you don't see my face!</p>
<p>——Why?</p>
<p>——I'm old, old and out of shape. If you can see my face, what good is it?</p>
<p>——What's the benefit of not seeing your face?</p>
<p>——You can imagine my face from a few years ago. It was much better then! I've gotten old suddenly in the last few years. If you see my face now, then the beautiful impression I had in your mind when I was young will also disappear completely.</p>
<p>——Hmph! Fourth……He seemed to want to protest. But he couldn't think of a reason to answer, although he had heard Fourth Sister-in-law say this hundreds of times.</p>
<p>——Really. You old thief! Haven't you seen my chicken?</p>
<p>——No, Fourth Sister-in-law, how can I see it? I really thought of the past! Have you forgotten? Once……</p>
<p>——Who remembers so much! You're really immortal? I'm asking you, where's my chicken?</p>
<p>——Who cares about your chicken!</p>
<p>——Oh my God! That's the only chicken I have! My house is leaking and about to collapse. Am I going to lose my chicken today?</p>
<p>——It must have been caught and eaten by the opera troupe. Fourth Sister-in-law! We're really getting old fast! You, you still have a granddaughter. I'm already sixty-six, and I'll always be a bachelor——This old bachelor was a naturally intelligent person, but he lived a lifetime of gambling, whoring, chivalry, and affection. He stretched out two hands as dry as firewood, groping forward, obviously wanting to touch Fourth Sister-in-law's hand. Fourth Sister-in-law put the kitchen knife in her hand to his hand. His hand touched the cold iron, and he retracted it like a cat's paw stretched forward and touched the flames.</p>
<p>——Oh! Fourth Sister-in-law……</p>
<p>——You're really immortal!</p>
<p>So this old woman, who, ten years ago, when she was about fifty, could still compete with the young girls in the whole village for her beauty, took back the kitchen knife and placed it on the "knife board" (the board used for cutting vegetables), then cleverly hung the "knife board" next to her feet in her neck with a rope, then reached out and pulled out the incense inserted in the stone pier, and beat the kitchen knife on the "knife board" with a rhythmic sound. The smoke circled around her hands in small white circles. She seemed to have suddenly forgotten that the man was standing beside her, and regardless of herself, she walked while beating her throat and scolding loudly: "Damned bastards! Those with muffled throats who steal my chicken to eat! My chicken is a crowing chicken, a guardian chicken, may those short-lived ghosts with rotten hearts and livers..."</p>
<p>The woman walked towards the road, stepping on her small, weak feet that were tightly bound, full of hatred, gradually scolding and moving away. Leaving behind an old bachelor, standing desolately under the sky lantern post, as if what he wanted had suddenly flown out of his arms. The scolding sounds beat on his half-deaf eardrums one by one. He strained his eyes, as if he had to see the back of his young lover, and all the memories like waves grabbed his heart. His already old blood couldn't help but bring a lot of pain to his heart. We can see that he lowered his head, and a little bit of fire came out of his pair of red eyes that were often watery. The old woman's scolding had circled into the village, shaking the village forest outside the village over there. The spring light was in the golden sun.</p>

<p>— Written by the German Storm, translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>I slowed down the sled a little, I was afraid she would notice, I tried my best to imitate Bart's rusty ice skate bottom sound. But this caution was unnecessary. Nali put her hands deep in the hand warmer, leaning back comfortably, the fur head covering almost on my arm. "Just push forward, Bartel!" she said. Bartel certainly obeyed the order and did not need her to order a second time.</p>
<p>We have already exceeded the range of ordinary skaters; not a bit of wind is moving; the white reeds growing along the lake shore emit dazzling light under the setting sun. We continued forward. When I looked down, I could see the eel grass's serpentine movement under the transparent glass cover.</p>
<p>But the center of the lake tempted me; I unconsciously turned the sled around, and we got farther and farther away from the lake shore. Turning my head back, I could only see the bottom of the reeds because of the light. The dim mirror surface mysteriously unfolded, until the distant opposite shore, it was almost impossible to tell whether this mirror surface was a solidified ice layer that could carry loads, or a calm and waveless water surface. Finally, we reached the center of the lake. All human footprints were gone: the sled drifted on the dark lake surface as if lost. Not a single blade of grass stretched out from this transparent thin cover; because it is said that the lake water here has no bottom. Only occasionally we felt as if a dark shadow suddenly slid past underneath. Perhaps this is that coffin fish?—According to legend, this monster lives in the deepest part of the lake, and only comes to the surface when someone or an animal drowns in the lake. "If the coffin fish comes up!" I thought, "If the ice breaks!" My eyes tried hard to see through the dark black ice block to the place where the lovely coffin fish was hiding.</p>
<p>I turned the sled around again and pushed forward, but still did not leave the range of the center of the lake. In front of us, that is, at the place where the lake shore intersects with a narrow river, the bridge can already be seen from a distance: the bridge stands like a shadow in the gray air.</p>
<p>"Go back, Bartel! It's getting cold!" Nali said.</p>
<p>I ignored her. "I wish she would look back!" I thought, and pushed the sled forward even faster. I was now longing for her to look back. But she seemed to have forgotten her warning, because she silently lowered her head and tightened herself inside her coat.—The sled continued to fly forward. I sometimes felt a slight fluctuation underneath, as if the thin ice was sinking and rising again under the flying sled; but I was not afraid at all, I knew how to deal with the ice like a virgin.</p>
<p>The short winter afternoon was almost over, and the sun ball was already falling like a fire on the edge of the horizon. It was getting cold, and the ice was making a creaking sound. The popping sound of the blizzard was getting louder and louder, from this shore to that shore, echoing across that vast and boundless ice mirror that was turning dark.</p>
<p>Nali leaned back and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid!" I said softly, "Nothing is wrong, this is the sound made by the evening wind."</p>

<h3 id="e229">The Trend of the Italo-Ethiopian Issue <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The conflict between Italy and Abyssinia has been going on for a long time, and it has not yet been resolved. Although the Council of the League of Nations passed a compromise proposal last month, and the Milan Four-Person Arbitration Committee also held a meeting once, judging from the current state of progress, the antagonism between the two countries has not only not shown any signs of easing, but also tends to become more dangerous day by day.</p>
<p>Italy's attempt to annex Abyssinia, Mussolini's ambition, has long been obvious and seen by the world. The reason why he repeatedly ordered mobilization but did not immediately start a war is that Mussolini's intention was to use this force to threaten Abyssinia's submission on the one hand, and to have some concerns about Britain and France on the other. Who knew that Abyssinia would be so stubborn, unwilling to submit, and have the intention of fighting the Italian army with the whole country, and Britain and France were also unwilling to sit idly by and watch Italy's unilateral action, and often expressed their intention to intervene. Although France has recently taken a temporary stance of silence, Britain has made clear statements. Eden declared in the House of Commons last time: "According to the treaty of 1906, Britain, France and Italy should consult on all issues concerning Abyssinia." And the new Prime Minister Baldwin also said in a speech in the Himley Hall the other day: "Dictatorial governments can take unexpected actions."</p>
<p>Mussolini was stimulated by this, and seeing that his ambition had not been realized, he must have been unhappy. Therefore, recently, in order to implement his established strategy</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>On the one hand, he implemented the third mobilization to put further pressure on Abyssinia, and on the other hand, he also issued tit-for-tat words, saying that Italy's actions should be decided by Italy itself, and outsiders should not interfere, in response to Eden's statement. As soon as Mussolini's words were published, the public opinions of Britain and Italy also rebuked each other with harsh words. Although this matter has not been expanded due to the Italian ambassador to Britain returning home to report and France's mediation, the rift that once occurred between the two countries has also been irreparable. The dispute between Italy and Abyssinia has caused the dispute between Britain and Italy, which shows the seriousness of the Abyssinian issue.</p>
<p>Although Eden has recently been in Italy to explain the origin of the Anglo-German naval agreement and to mediate the Italo-Ethiopian issue, I am afraid that Italy will not necessarily be willing to compromise?</p>
<h3 id="e230">Month <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Sishong</p>
<p>I love the moon. I love its round cheeks, its pure face, and its gentle demeanor. When the long sky is entirely blue, covered without a cloud, how beautiful, how serene, and how captivating is the world it rules!</p>
<p>In the world shrouded in moonlight, the piercing rays of daylight are withdrawn, giving birth to poetic sentiments and spreading warmth across the earth. At this time, cool breezes often accompany the silver glow of the moon, presenting the world with another景象, and nurturing another flavor in human hearts. The air is filled with a sweet and warm atmosphere: all the ugly and filthy images of the human world during the day quietly retreat. The moon uses its gentle silver light to cover up all ugliness, comforting the suffering and unfortunate. If a person climbs to the peak of a high mountain at this time, they will see the rugged rocks transformed into small, grayish-white stones, and the earth becoming a blurred, mysterious realm. The forest is shrouded in hazy gray smoke, and the giant, ugly dark green will turn into a mysterious, gentle grass. The vast fields will become a flat, boundless avenue, and the uneven heights and sizes of houses in the human world will become adorable toys for children. At this time, singing a song will resonate through the Milky Way; softly reciting a poem will spread across the vast fields; even softly sighing, the poignant flavor will move those who are sound asleep. If a lullaby is sung at this time, its enchanting power will lull even the sleepless city into a sweet slumber.</p>
<p>Or, go to the boundless sea and watch the moonlight dance silver flowers on the deep blue waves, a scene that is the best decoration in the world. Even better if there is a strong wind, transforming the waves into ever-changing patterns. At this time, the sea is boundless, and the world seems empty and without substance. The tiny stars in the sky only twinkle with small eyes, and the creatures of the human world seem numb or anesthetized. A large fish in the sea might suddenly flick its tail, an action that only expresses emotion, not annoyance. Although the sea is leaping with wild waves, the world is still peaceful and gentle, filled with captivating tranquility.</p>
<p>Or, have a lovely person accompany you for a stroll in the forest. At this time, the moonlight filters through the dense leaves, casting sparse shadows, and the trees stand tall with their majestic bodies. The silver light of the moon will help lovers pour out sweet whispers, and the forest seems to be secretly eavesdropping. The soft footsteps will resonate with harmonious rhythms, and the moon will stamp a sacred and eternal oath on the lovers' hearts. The silver light strokes the lover's heart, kisses the lover's lips, testifies to the滔滔 of sweet words, and also pre-sets the time for the lovers' next rendezvous when the moon is full again.</p>
<p>If you and your young companions go boating in the middle of the river, the joy of life is not easily obtained. At this time, the moon coats the river with a thin layer of silver, and the river reflects a bright light. An oar stirs the gurgling sound of the river; a song or a laugh in the boat can spread the joyful mood to the shore. The reeds, teased by the light oars, can play pleasant music; a small cloud in the sky will have a huge power, leading the young people to trace the source of the river and explore its mysteries.</p>
<p>Even on a moonless night, the moon still has its enchanting power. Look at her shy maiden posture, her light steps, and her secretive expression, and how they affect the hearts of young men. Although the earth is dark at this time, the stars still twinkle in the sky, and the crescent moon shines in the space. The lovelorn will feel sad, the elderly will recall the past, and the soldiers will remember their distant young wives. Once the moon waxes again, the gentle silver light can comfort them, awaken them, or caress them, and make their hearts rejoice, still filled with joy or the hope of regeneration.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Dream <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Jingyun</p>
<p>The smoky past, when recalled, is simply a dream!</p>
<p>Whenever it is late at night, when everyone is quiet, when I cannot write and stop my pen to think, unconsciously the memories of the past always swirl in my mind, disturbing my peaceful mood. Finally, I angrily throw the pen forcefully on the table, exhale a breath, and sigh sadly, "Who could have imagined that I would now be trapped in this narrow attic, facing the dim and bleak ghost-like lamplight, writing this lousy article? ... Life is nothing more than a dream, a缥缈 dream!" Suddenly, my head sinks like the swaying willow branches outside the window, drooping and uttering a hoarse, drawn-out voice, groaning like a panting ox.</p>
<p>Six or seven years ago, it was when I had great ambitions and was arrogant about everything. At that time, my father's business in the southern country of Siam had not yet been hit by the tide of the economic panic. He often raised that plump hand that held strong economic power, twirled the two-character mustache on his lips, and silently used his shrewd mind to plan how to develop his business, so that he could gain more glory and be praised and envied by people! It was during that time of economic abundance that I had just completed my secondary school education and, with my father's permission, traveled far across the ocean to see the scenery of the foreign land. Every evening, I always liked to drag my slippers with my shop assistant, Du Zichang, and walk slowly on the sidewalk of the Royal Field, admiring the silver,碎般 moonlight that sifted down from the陰蓊 leaves; or go to the vast and森佛" (Wat Pho), listening to the monks chanting Buddhist scriptures in a low hum, and striking the bells and chimes with a叮叮篤篤 sound; or ride in a small boat, floating on the蜿 and peaceful湄南河 River, peeling and eating the sweet and fresh fruits unique to the southern country, while quietly listening to the graceful and melodious singing of the girls on the "水帕" (Siamese people's water "home") that came from afar. At that time, Du Zichang often revealed a smiling face to me intentionally or unintentionally, saying, "Fourth Young Master, look how beautiful the scenery of the foreign land is, how can唐山 have such a peaceful and prosperous night scene! I think you should stay here for a long time, help "座山" manage the business, and then slowly choose a young and beautiful番娘 to marry, haha, Fourth Young Master, the temperaments of番娘 are mostly gentle, and they are as considerate to their husbands as a tame cat, how harmonious and happy it would be to have a home and family!" He coughed and cleared his hoarse throat, and continued, "You don't want to be a洋状元, so why bother thinking about going to college and studying abroad! ... In fact, even if you become a 洋状元 and get some kind of doctorate back, you may not earn more money than "座山". Fourth Young Master, does what I say make sense?" These rambling words of his lingered in my ears, seeming to have no great influence or effect. After a moment of silence, I replied casually and lightly, "Brother Zichang, my personality doesn't seem very suitable for doing business. Asking me to sit in the shop all day, tapping the abacus beads答答, is like being in prison! In any case, I can't do this kind of life." Naturally, at that time, I felt an infinite aversion and contempt for these merchants who could not tolerate the slightest carelessness and who hid knives in their smiles, making me unable to get along with commerce, as if it were 柄鑒. In my heart, I thought that other than studying more, the road of running a business was impassable. Soon, my father finally accepted my opinion and sent me back to China to go to school. When I left the southern country, my father personally sent me to the pier, not letting his emotions show on his face, dragging his voice and sternly instructing me word by word, "Yun'er, you must work hard in the future, hoping to have some achievements and bring glory to the family. ..." After he finished speaking, he breathed a sigh of relief, as if he had placed his hopes on his son.</p>
<p>Now, my father's plump hand that held the strong economic power has lost its former strength, and is withered and trembling slightly. Although his strong, silent, and fully rational mind is constantly planning to restore the glory of the past, the depressed market situation has clearly given him a great disappointment; even his son, in whom he placed his hopes, cannot achieve his wishes in the slightest, making his face gray and dim, as if covered with a thin layer of dust, his hair also斑斑 gray, and he has entered the sadness and loneliness of old age!</p>
<p>When I think of my own future and the past, which is like姻, a feeling of indescribable melancholy arises in the depths of my heart. Life is nothing more than a dream! A缥渺 dream!</p>

<p>In order to train talent for sound films, Lianhua has organized a opera and music concert. The first preparatory meeting of the society was held at the Xujiahui headquarters a few days ago. More than 40 people attended, including directors and actors such as Sun Yu, Wang Cilong, and Li Lili.</p>
<p>The conference resolved: The society was renamed "Lianhua Music Troupe," adopted twelve articles of association, and elected general managers, accountants, and secretaries for each group. As a result, Jin Qingyu was elected as the general manager, Zhu Shilin as the accountant, and Li Lili as the director of the Western Music Department. The troupe was originally divided into three departments: Pingju, Chinese music, and Western music. It has now been decided to add a drama group.</p>
<h3 id="e236">"Beginning of Man" Re-released by the Central Theater <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>"Beginning of Man," directed by Shi Dongshan of Yihua Sound Film, which was well received by various newspapers after being screened at Jincheng for half a month, is now being re-released at the Central Grand Theater on Sixth Avenue. When this film was released at Jincheng, the sound was slightly imperfect due to certain reasons. Now, the clarity of the sound at the Central Theater is fully comparable to foreign films. As for the twists and turns of the plot, the moving reality of sorrow and power, the excellent expressions of the actors, the beauty of the light, and the greatness and realism of the scenery, there has long been public comment. Those who have not seen it are invited to take the time to watch it, and you will be satisfied.</p>

<p>The Northwest Film Company's new films "Long Live the Ages" and "Ten Thousand Miles of Wind and Sand" are about to begin filming. In addition to hiring several skilled actors in Shanghai for the main roles in the two dramas, the company will also strive to promote new talents. It is reported that the company's method for promoting new talents is set as two items: 1. To advertise in Taiyuan to recruit 30 students for a training class, and after three months of training, those with excellent results will be selected as the company's basic actors. 2. To recruit many actors in Ping, Jin, Jing, and Hu as basic actors. It is reported that the registration for the training class recruited in Taiyuan has now begun, and the recruitment in other places will also be realized soon. After this plan is realized, there will definitely be a group of comets discovered on the Chinese film scene.</p>
<p>The Northwest Company's "Long Live the Ages" is adapted based on the historical facts of the Xin亥 Revolution. The roles in the play are all male, and the entire film does not feature a single female. This can be regarded as a groundbreaking event in China. After this film is successful, it can be called unique in conjunction with the film "Female" by the Wufa Company, which uses all women.</p>
<p>The Northwest Company recently found a square of more than 40 acres in Taiyuan and is building a film set. The design is by the famous director Wu Yonggang. It is reported that after completion, it will dominate the country and can be used to shoot interior scenes of war scenes with 5,000 people.</p>
<p>Shi Jipu, director of the Northwest Company, has recently begun to work on the segmentation of "Long Live the Ages" with a very cautious attitude. It is reported that in order to make the lengthy and dry historical facts cinematic, Mr. Shi will pay special attention to the rhythm of emotions. Other aspects, such as the angle of the lens and the　preparation of the mood, will also be carefully studied.</p>
