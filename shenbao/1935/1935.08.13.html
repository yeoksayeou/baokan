<h3>羅斯爵士來華</h3>
<p>— 行</p>
<p>英政府首席經濟顧間羅斯爵士。本月十日偕英財部要員巴志及英倫銀行專家羅傑士起程來華。道出東京。將勾留數日。與日政府當局討論遠東經濟問題。因此傳說紛起。或謂羅斯此來。意欲改革中國幣制。使我國參加英鎊集團。或謂英國將向日本提議。重訂類似往昔英日同盟之新協。約英國方面卽有此等企圖。在目前情勢之下。似亦不易實現然。而羅斯來華。携有對華經濟援助之計劃。固彼所正式表示。亦吾人所共知者也。</p>
<p>援助今日中國經濟之道無他。投資而已。投資之用途如何。姑置不論。至其方式。要不出於兩途一爲單獨投資。一爲共同投資。英國爲鞏固其遠東經濟地位起見。早有對華單獨投資之意。徒以障碍茶多。迄未成議。月前外電盛傳。倫敦方面又有英美法日共同對華投資之擬議。羅斯此來。便道訪日。其主要使命。殆在此乎。</p>
<p>日本對於共同投。資最近是否願留磋商餘地。尚難確知但。不久以前。日外務省固曾正式聲明。反對此議者。觀於日本近來對華各種措施尤。知日本排除遠東列强勢力之念甚切。蓋日本在華單獨投資計劃已在積極進行之中。東省固無諭矣。在華北問題告一段落以後。所謂興發祥銀。行興中公司等均。在陸續組織鐵道棉。田之調查建設亦。已準備大規模進行日本在。華紡織業同業會會長船津辰一郎。仕平　表談話且謂不出十。年北平天津將成爲東洋紡織工　之。中心是誠可謂目空一切者矣。</p>
<p>吾人綜觀今日情勢深知英國。主張共同投資日本則主張單獨投資。英國欲對華作一般的援助日本則欲從開發。華北入手循序漸進英國投資主張採取對我政府談判。手續日本投資則主張採。取中日民間合辦企業之投資形式雙方意見扞格若此設。羅斯此次訪日果有遊說日本參加四國。銀專之任　　能有所成就乎。</p>
<p>羅斯已來華矣此。來使命能否完成視其訪日結果如。何當可明瞭我國今日內則百業凋敝農村破產天災人。禍連續不絕外則遭受日本大陸政策及美國購。銀政策之二重打擊以言政治經濟。現狀實無異戰後之德國其亟需他國經濟上之援助母庸諱。言羅斯此來而果能。促成對華投資之實現者則無論爲單獨的行動。抑共同的行動我國均應就獨立。國家之立塲審愼考量投資條件是否僅。以供獻經濟上及技術上之計。劃爲限而不致侵害我神聖的國家主權在另一方。面投資性質是否。從中國全般的財政經濟着。眼而無變相瓜分之意味此爲承受與。否之先决問題全國朝野所宜。密切注意也</p>

<p>舊金山美國太平洋國交侖研究員蜜蘭女士今日發表一文、聲稱美國種植長絨棉之農業家不必爲行將失去日本之市塲憂慮、日本現雖圖於美國境外試行植棉事業、但其需要仍不能不仰賴美國、至於印度中國及拉丁美洲雖皆產棉、然决難取代美國之地位、美棉之優點决非新種棉者、急切所能倖致日本棉織廠用慣美棉、自不能供其他產地之棉作試騐、且新行種棉之家、對於棉之需要日戚迫切、能否以餘棉供給日本實屬疑問、故卽使日本行將放棄美棉亦必須經過極長之期間也、另據統計、一九三四年度美輸入日本、棉花佔總額之百分之五十五、對於日本之棉花輸入總額亦佔百分之四十八、印棉仍佔第二位、日本向美國及印度以外所購棉花僅佔總額之百分之十、較以前四年中所增不到百分之一也、自一九三一年至一九三四年、美國棉織物輸出總值美金一〇、六二〇〇〇元、同時期中棉花輸往日本者增三六、九一三、〇〇〇元、故日本棉織物輸出之增加對於美貨並無多大影響、况棉織品僅佔美國一九三四年度總輸出之百分之二、而棉花則佔百分之十七也、（十一日國民電）</p>

<p>致詞、略云、今日爲本會第二次招待各廠業主及代表、其目的欲使各業先進、明瞭本會初步工作程序之意義、俾彼此得以合作之精神、其謀有效之救濟、庶工商業復興期望得、漸見諸事實、查我國工商事業、自來即陷於入超年增、自銀外流、不良環境中、發展本感困難、近以世界經濟狂潮、轉襲吾華復、益以九一八及一二八之影響、致地價暴跌、信用緊縮、而工商業藉為生產之流動籌碼、遂驟感短缺、因此工商業之生產狀態、乃顯現空前未有之慘象、倘不亟謀救濟、勢必趨向崩潰、是則國計民生、將兩受危害、上海市商會有鑒於此、起而延聘各業領袖及專工作、若就表面觀之、或可疑爲迂緩、如果加以於起疲救衰、則對於過去由疲致衰之原因、不能治病為喻、若病者祇求醫者治其外病、而置演化外病之內病、及造成內病之原因、秘而不宣、則外病必因內病未治歷時且將重發、實非治病求强之道、今日本會邀請各位蒞臨、即欲倩各位共同合作按照初步工作程序、力求工商業形成衰疲之內病、及造成內病這原因、至於救濟外病之流通停滯籌碼各問題、亦在積極研究、並未置而不問云、次續由</p>
<p>任矜蘋陳述</p>
<p>意見、咯謂今日我國工商業之所以衰落、論其外病、則為外貨傾銷、白銀外流、地價低减、籌碼短少、購買力暴跌等等、已為盡人所知、論其內痌、則為經濟人事、俱無健全之組織、亦幾為盡人所知、因此對於外病內病之原因、不能不切實研究、茲單就個人見聞所及、言工商業經濟人事組織所以不健全之原因、以就敎於今事業者、常因本身資力薄弱、對於管理員工、每遂因此益見减縮、於是乃形成事業前進人事紛亂經濟不敷之現狀、而其他各種弊端、皆由此而生、史由此種弊端、造成事業之內體虛弱、因事業內體虛弱之故、對於前述種種外病之攻襲、遂致無法防衛、無法抵抗、故就余個人之見解言、認爲治理事業之意義、與治理國家相同、治國之道、目標有二、對內在求全民生活之安全、對外在能防禦侵略之攻擊、但能防禦侵略之攻擊、必須先求全民生活之安全、否則不獨不能防禦外來之攻擊、亦且不能獲得他人之援助、甚或獲得援助以後、仍舊於事無濟、譬如有一失業者、其人每月之生活費爲二十元、今因困於經濟、不能生活、必須待貸欵之援救、設有人貸以百元、而其人仍不事生產、則第六月必仍不能生活如故、故工商業果以期待他人援救爲希望、必須研究阻碍本身生產原因而排除之、顯現具有值得援救之精神、並使人信其獲得援救以後、必能增生產、如此、則工商業對於阻碍本身生產之原因、不可不急起研究、研究原因之方法、首須重視統計、著各種事態之利害、俱可由統計方法辦析之、茲</p>
<p>舉數例以證</p>
<p>之、（一）總經理或廠長蒞臨辦公之時間、常在上午十一時以後、即可知總經理或廠長、每日耗費其思想精神與時間、在一小時以上、即事業每日减少小時以上推進之能力、（二）種出品推銷到達之地點、爲江蘇浙江兩省、即可知推銷未能、其能事、以江浙兩省以外之國內市塲、及國界以引之海引市塲、皆生視放棄、（三）主持事業者與員工間、分別北為酌舉其例、其他任何事太之利審、皆可以統計方法辨析之、本會之欲請各位對於調查工作、計方法、詳細辨析其利害、而訓練工作、則爲增加人事能力之方法、足供存利云審之應用、是故工商業欲期待經齊之援救、不司不設法明辦利害、銷滅或减少事業內體虛弱之原因、若事業內體、漸增强健、則事業信用、必可增加、而獲得經濟之援救、自必較易、並在獲得經濟援救以後、內可力求事業之生存、外可抵抗經濟之侵略云、最後分發調查表、並由各廠代表周元泰等表示願與該會切實合作之誠意、至六時宜告散會、</p>

<h3>確認非婚生子案　三訴後發回列審　張武伯始亂終棄置妻兒於不顧　法醫檢驗斷張志第為武伯所生　—兩審均吿敗訴第三審方始發回—</h3>

<p>正式婚禮</p>
<p>之語、作為臨別之贈言、故方氏從此閉戶撫孤、但張　一去即無消息、該氏雖恒興陌頭柳色之悲、然仍存　　　　　　　　　　　以待所天歸來、豈意望穿秋水、終不見返、前歲、該氏一日挈兒步出、途中不期遇張、久別初逢、大喜之下、立命稚子趨呼阿爺、俾回回家、叙天倫之樂事、訴</p>
<p>別後離衷</p>
<p>詎張此時竟視該氏母子如路人、掉首揚長自云、該氏憤甚、恍然其　日所謂赴日者、乃欲施行遺棄之手段、因以志敏之法定監護人名義、對張武伯提起確認親子之訴、初審時、因被告否認與方氏生子、經第一特區地方法院將該孩送請眞茹法醫研究所檢騐之下、認定確與被告之血族相同、斷爲被告所生、但以</p>
<p>其他理由</p>
<p>不爲第一審法院認爲滿足、故判决原告之訴駁回、方氏不服、即投高二分院上控、並於庭訊時、供明張武伯曾患橫痃、此種隱疾、非外人所能知、足可證明伊確與張同居、該孩則屬同居時所生、且有法醫鑑定、要求廢棄原判、確認志敏為張之新生子、但第二審結果、仍將其上訴駁回、謂依據民法規定、非婚生子女、請求</p>
<p>生父認領</p>
<p>之權利、應於子女出生後五年間行使、逾期此項權利、即歸消滅、張武伯縱係張志敏之生父、而其認領之請求、已過法定期間、應予駁回云云、方氏並不因兩番敗訴而自餒、依然再接再厲、更延陳震律師向最高法院上訴、瀝敘被張乘其年幼引誘姦汚生子後誑稱赴日經商、避不見面、嗣經途遇、則反眼若不相識、</p>
<p>始亂終棄</p>
<p>喪心害理之種種經過事實、及不服第一第二兩審判决之三點理由、請求廢棄原判、庶天下非婚生子、均得免終為無父之兒、最高法院近經吊集全案卷宗、審查明晰、認第二審判决、殊欠適當、尤不應引用請求權</p>
<p>時效消滅</p>
<p>之法條、遂將原則廢棄、發交江蘇高等法院第二分院更為審判、昨晨、高二分院開庭、被上訴人張武伯亦延熊律師代表出庭、而上訴人張方氏·張志敏·母子則由陳震律師代理、庭上旋略訊事實一過一以尚須傳訊證人、即諭改期再訊、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （王莎葩）</p>
<p>國人對於旁的什麼事，都似乎有些不大起勁，不大高興，可是對於賭博一項，却特別來得歡喜，尤其是麻將，我眞想不出這小小的一百三十六張麻將牌，會有這麼偉大引誘的魔力？住在我們前樓的汽車夫阿毛家，一個月裏頭，總有四個禮拜是叉麻將的，廂房裏的二房東，也是那麼一桌常擺，就是灶披裏當馬路小工的山東老鄉，每個晚上，也要上對門老虎灶去來幾剷五百剷，有許多娘兒們，情願把家事擱起來，而去摸上八圈或十二圈。更有人嫌自己家裏賭的不暢快，還借起旅館大賭特賭，大有飯儘可少吃，麻將不能不叉之槪？其實這叉麻將的事，是最不合算的，想穿了眞一點無味，四個人坐下來賭錢，結果有贏錢人的時候，也便是有輸錢人的時候；但是，輸錢還是小事，精神的損失，光陰的蹉跎，恐怕此輸錢更大哩。</p>
<h3>模範女監獄</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>從法國留學回來的一位朋友對我說，「在法國的弗列生省裏，有一所女監獄。在這一個監獄裏坐牢，簡直比住在家裏還舒服。」</p>
<p>他說：「這個監獄，宛如是一個別墅。廣塲和花台等等，佈置成了一個四方形的大花園。</p>
<p>「在這個監獄裏，孩子們是可以跟着母親們坐牢的。照他們的規例，母親犯了罪，是不許把孩子丟着不管的。最低的限度，也得待孩子滿了四歲，才許分離。可是在事實上，總是因母子拾不得分離，而待犯罪的母親，刑期屆滿之後，一同出獄的。</p>
<p>「監獄的建築，也和其他的監獄相仿，一樣的有鐵窗防範着。但是在這一切可怖的鐵條上面，都染漆着悅目的顏色。晚上的燈光，也很充足。每一個囚犯的房裏，除了一張大床之外，還有一張小床，或是一個搖籃。一切，都和住在宿舍裏，沒甚分別，除了伊們是沒有出外的自由。不過伊們的孩子，却是可以整天的在外面塲地上玩要的。</p>
<p>「在這監獄裏的管獄的，對待這些有孩子的女犯，是不用難看的嘴臉的，理由是防免小孩子們將來有一個惡印象，永遠的印在腦膜上。</p>
<p>「因此，從那個監獄裏，刑滿被釋出來的婦人，往往因受了感化，而變成了很好的了。」</p>
<p>據說，在法國，這個監獄，就叫做「法國的模範女監獄，」而且正準備着把這種監獄制度，推行全國呢。</p>
<h3>詩謎</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>詩謎又稱詩寶，其法把五言七言或古體詩一句，抽去一字，陪以相同的四字，書於句旁，任人猜壓，中者以一倍三，這眞是以詩爲賭的一類遊戲。前淸每逢歲考時，無聊文人，設攤於貢院的旁邊，引那投考士子們入彀。那些士子們雖是肚裏有點墨水，而且也會哼幾句試帖詩；可是對於好的謎條，也難以捉摸，總是十有九敗，弄得袋中空空如也而歸。至於上海之有詩謎，最早却在邑廟後錢糧公所旁，偶於新正露天擺設，猜壓的人犬都是些販夫走卒之流；他們雖不識字，是照寶路猜壓，也覺自有興趣。迨民國十一二年間，新世界商塲中始有人擺設，以白錫包茄立克香烟作酬，於是那些略識之無的男女，無不權作詩翁，推敲猜壓，生意興隆，由一攤而分設十餘攤。嗣後大世界及各遊戲塲也接踵興起，各總會及街頭巷尾也靡不有詩謎的設立，一股風起雲湧的氣派，比之當年的交易所潮，也有過無不及，恐怕因此而傾家蕩產投河上吊的也不乏其人咧。這樣風行了二三年，玩的人也厭了，當局也加以取締，於是詩翁絕迹，謎條也束之高閣。目下碩果僅存的僅愛多亞路冠雲詩集一家，生意也未見興隆咧。</p>
<p>講到詩謎是原於古之隱語廋詞，與射覆相類。最佳之謎條，五字勻稱，天衣無縫，眞叫猜者恍惚迷離，難以捉摸。也有故意用抝句俗字者，是猶兵家之用奇，偶一則可，多用也不靈。嗣後姦詐者流，用梅花本作條，無異牌九中的翻戲，於是文人絕足，而謎運也從此告終。</p>
<h3>人同此心，心同此理。</h3>
<p>— 涓隱</p>
<h3>接吻</h3>
<p>— 鑑文</p>
<p>接吻是一種流行病嗎？在生理學者的眼光裏應該承認是的。試想在嘴唇與嘴唇接觸的時候，不是很容易傳染病菌嗎？</p>
<p>然而從另一方面設想：嘴唇是觸覺器官，感覺極爲靈敏，是人類重要的表情工具。微笑，含慍，擬嘴，憤怒，……從嘴唇的變動裏都可以流露出來，電影演員對於這些嘴唇上動作的變化，也是非常的注意。因爲接吻是激動情威，表示親熱的所爲。</p>
<p>從這樣一個理由上，靑年人和中年人歡喜同小孩子接吻，固然不可反對；靑年人同靑年人，中年人同中年人，男性同女性的互相接吻，我們也沒有誹議的理由。但是爲什麼在中國社會裏，對於接吻會當作是一種不可公開的秘密呢？</p>
<p>據說法國兵士接受勳章時，長官在受勳章的兵士兩頰上接一次吻，當作一種嚴重的典禮。足見接吻這行爲在沒有這風俗的社會，會當作不同的變態的事情，以致認爲是秘密的羞恥的事情。</p>
<p>今後我們爲着健康和衛生，不應該任意的狂吻天眞的小孩；爲着尊重人們表情的自由，對於中年人，靑年人彼此的接吻，也不要看得太嚴重了！</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>日本人的淸潔運動</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>到過中國的外國人，總是說中國不淸潔，不衛生。自從各處舉行新生活這動之後，民衆或可漸漸的注意起來。茲將日人的淸潔運動，獻給讀者，以爲借鑑</p>
<p>日本房屋，都用木材，又不髹漆，論理很易污穢。但是他們室內都鋪草蓆，下面塡着柴殼。穿了地襪走上去，很柔軟的。每天早晨起身之後，主婦便用濕茶葉，撒在席上，自己帶着嘴套，室內掃除。再用濕布將窗戶攔干揩拭。室外的地板上，也用濕布擦着。兩手握着抹布，上身俯倒了，向前推過去，我們便名之曰開電車。扶梯上廁所裏，也都要親手洗擦。日人雇用婢僕的人家很少，大都由主婦自己動手。</p>
<p>每家門口有一隻木製的垃圾箱，上面寫着某某專用。每天早晨淸道夫搖着鈴，自去掃除。門外的街道或是人行道，每天總要去掃兩三次，有時要用長柄的棕刷擦着。他們很喜歡用水灑在路上，以防塵埃。好在都穿皮鞋木屐　並不妨礙，在中國或者要被行人討厭的。</p>
<p>五分錢洗一次澡，是日人的日常生活，身上洗淨了，才到澡池裏去浸着，所以池內的水總是很淸的。普通浴水內，都有石炭酸，沿海的便利用海水。他們在浴堂裏自己修面，替兒子剃和尚頭，不要耗費一個錢。</p>
<p>蒼蠅當然也有，某次在公共墓地中，看見石碑上的蒼蠅，計有數千，不知什麼緣故。他們平常袋裏都藏着許多白紙頭，用來揩拭鼻涕。但隨地吐痰的人，不少於我國，在室內時却不多了。還有勞工常在小衖的水溝旁，隨意小便。以淸潔著名的日本，此種惡習慣尚難完全改正，我國倘能大家注意，未必不及他們。</p>
<p>日本的警察辦理得不錯，他們不常住在局裏，時常挾着戶口冊四處檢查。所以革家有多少人，行動怎樣，不能逃過他們的耳目。菜館旅館，檢查很嚴，廚房廁所，都要檢查。只要痰盂裏沒有放臭藥水，便有處罰的危險。大掃除每年要舉行好幾次，大約有一定的日子。掃除的時候，把屋內笨重的東西，搬在人行道上，澈底的淸潔了一次。</p>
<p>早晨六七時左右，店員全體動員淸潔掃除，櫃台櫥窗，都是一塵不染。沿街的玻璃門戶，一天要揩刷一兩回。理髮所用的東西，平時浸在消毒水裏，用的時候，才拿他出來。修面括下來的鬍鬚和肥皂沫，揩在白紙上面，並不隨地拋棄。理髮匠不論男女，都用嘴套護口，以防嘴裏的熱氣，使顧客嫌惡。</p>
<p>糞便由市政府處理，專雇工人，到人家去倒糞。也用糞桶裝着，蓋很密切，絕對不會傾溢出來，臭氣也不多。十多隻糞桶，裝在雙輪的貨車上，面上用油布蓋沒，由人工挽着，運到倉庫裏去。倒糞的時間，好像上下午都有，並無一定。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隱痛爭看貴人臉共仰高風</p>
<p>志前接着道：若說帮點小忙，我也不能說不行。這樣好了，我送你一點小欵，在路上貝些點心吃罷。說着，在身上取了一張五元鈔票，交到浣花面前桌子上。浣花的臉上，實在不能不突出笑容來了。手扶了桌子，站着道：多謝多謝！我也是沒法。說着，便低頭看了那張鈔票。志前道：你只管收起來得了，我拿出來了，當然不會是假意。若說嫌少。浣花搖頭道：那可千萬不敢。這才慢慢的將那張鈔要，收到袋裏去了。好像還有什麼事，不大順勢的樣子，又坐下來了，强笑道：我眞不好意思，和程先生一點關係沒有，倒要程先生破費。志前笑道：惟具是我在超然的地位，我才好帮點小忙。要不然，爲圖着什麼，才掏出這點欵子，那也太難了。浣花又是低頭坐着。志前怕他還有什麼要求，只好把敬客的烟捲，點了一支，很無聊的抽着。浣花緩緩的抬起頭來，問道：程先生在西安，大槪還要躭擱一些時候吧？志前道：却也說不定。浣花將手理着鬢髮，微笑道：你太太一定在家裏很念你的。志前道：我是常常出門的人，那倒也無所謂。浣花低了頭將手抬起來，兩面慢慢的翻着看，問道：晚上程先生有客來嗎？志前正色道：楊小姐，我已經說了，我是乾乾凈凈帮你一點小忙，你不必多心。我也該出門去看朋友了。（二八八）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這時候，所有的人的眼睛全已牢牢地釘住在那一塊綠地氈似的荷叢上了；我自己更是特別的興奮，兩顆眸子沒命的漲大，漲漲又漲，—正和那些肥大的蓓蕾在同時漲大着。的確，它們也在那裏漲啊！幾百支，幾千支，凡爲我們的視綫能够及得到的所在，全有它們的影兒，沒一支不在漲着，搖着，放着。</p>
<p>太陽越透越高了，巳有半個掛起來了。</p>
<p>那幾千百支蓓蕾也越放越大了。</p>
<p>像這樣太陽儘升起來，荷花儘開放起來，空氣中頓時就添了一重淸香撲鼻的氣味，在我們的頭上吹着，在我們的兩旁拂着，似乎述人的呼吸也香了。這正是最可愛的荷花香啊！其時東方的一半紅霞已罩過半空，快要侵入西方來了。那些荷花的蓓蕾吸引住了每一個觀衆，大家都覺得這是最可愛的景象，每支蓓蕾全像一個小孩子的小拳頭，那些花瓣更像是一條條肥白粉嫩的小指頭；它們在開放的時候，正和一個小孩子睡醒之後，把他的小拳頭徐徐展開的情景一般無二，的確值得欣賞。</p>
<p>我因爲方才曾聽太后說過，要我們「聽着」，於是我就側着耳朵，用心聽着；實際上原是聽不到什麼聲音的，祗因受了心理作用的影響；我彷彿眞的巳聽到那些荷花開放時的沙沙之聲了（三八八）</p>

<h3>江蘇義務教育的現狀和計劃</h3>
<p>— （周佛海在江蘇省府紀念週報告）</p>
<p>江蘇義務敎育在十九年度（十九年八月至二十年七月）簡單的統計、初級小學校、只有七千三百五十餘校、初等舉級只有一萬二千七百餘級入學兒童只有五十八萬餘名、未入學兒童共有三百九十餘萬左右、入學兒童的百分比、止不過百分之十二點六、本人到任伊始、目擊如此情形、認爲非從速設法救濟不可、同時又因爲各縣敎育經費、經過歷年來的浮支濫用、紊亂異常、大半都鬧虧欠、當然不能再擴充事業、所以對於晋及義敎的工作、只决定下列數項、（一）充實學額、（二）改良私塾、（三）勸導私人設學、（四）規定鄕鎭設立初級小學、四年以來、雖然不能達到理想之目的、就數字簡括統計、不能說浚有些許進步、如照二十二年度統計來說、校數已增至九千零五十三校級數增至一萬六千六百八十二級、入校兒童已增至八十萬零四千八百八十九名、入學兒童的白分比、也增至百分之十四·八、這稱些少的進步、雖然杯水車薪、無俾時艱、但是在近年民生凋瘁、天災流行之時、做到這個情形、巳感覺到心力俱疲的了、</p>
<p>本年二三月間、感覺到鎭江雖是省會、但失學兒童之多、竟比蘇常滬海一帶縣份、有過無不及、認爲亟須救濟、所以擬就省敎育經費中、抽撥一部份、在省會城區設立義務教育學籍一百幾、先課部份的補救、適教育部方面、也有補助欵項辦理義務教育之計議、本廳到此項消息、就派員到教部多次協商、請多撥經費、以利進行、後來敎部來電令自籌經費至少半數以上、以憑支配協欵、敎育部王部長復親自來鎭、和陳主席及本人共同商定撥欵數目、結果决定由省方自籌十五萬元、中央也撥助十五萬元、現在省方十五萬元巳經決定由省敎育經費留學費項下撥十萬元、省庫撥五萬元、中央撥欵、巳來電允給十二萬元、經派員到部力爭、大約由庚欵內、還可撥三萬元凑成十五萬元、</p>
<p>經費旣巳籌定、就要擬定計劃、準備實施、上兩星期內曾開過全省義務敎育委員會議、將所擬實施計劃通過、計劃的內容可分幾方面來說、</p>
<p>（一）經費來源</p>
<p>（一）省方籌十五萬元中央補助十五萬元兩共三十萬元、</p>
<p>（二）各縣開辦費就地勸募或攤派、併設備及校舍修理建築計之、需約三十萬元、六十一縣中有五十縣須自籌經當費之半數、此欵動用縣總預備費或敎育總基金約十一萬餘元、一二兩項共達七十餘萬元、</p>
<p>（二）推行方法</p>
<p>（甲）設級數目（江寗自治實騐縣除外）子、省會城區一百級、丑、溧水高淳江浦六合揚中儀徵句容東海淮陰灌雲十縣各五十級、共五百級、如一時不能籌得全部開辦費、可分春秋兩季設立、寅、其他五十縣各設十級至十五級共七百五十級、</p>
<p>共添設一千三百五十級</p>
<p>（乙）辦理內容子、新設學級至少半數以上爲一年制短期小學、並須採用二部制、丑、新設學級內之普通初小學級、也要採用二部制、寅、新設學級每級學生數至少須五十人、由一個敎師擔任敎學、但二部制事級每一個敎師要擔任敎一百個學生爲原則、卯、各縣設級地點、以失學兒童多寡爲先後、所增入學兒童數、計七百級作二部制、每級一百人計、共七萬人、六百五十級每級五十人計、共三萬二千五百人、兩共十萬二千五百人零、</p>
<p>（三）師資</p>
<p>（一）省會城區敎員、已令各省立師範及鄕村師範保薦本屆畢業生中優秀分子、聽候選明、己足敷用、（二）溧水等十縣、設級旣多、師資缺乏、除以省縣師範畢業生儘先任用外、春李設立之學級敎師、可以高中畢業生訓練三個月充任、（三）其他各縣以任用省縣師範生爲主或考試錄用、</p>
<p>（四）經費支配</p>
<p>（一）各縣新增學級共七百五十級每級一百五十元（半數）計共十一萬二千五百元、（二）溧水等十縣共五百級每級三百元計共十五萬元、（三）省會一百級每級二百五十元計共三萬五千元、（四）準備金二千五百元、共三十萬元、</p>
<p>（五）校舍及設備</p>
<p>（一）校舍、利用公共塲所、或自建棚舍、或租賃民房、（二）設備力求簡單、課桌椅可中學生自備、計劃的內容如此、現在各縣應設級數、巳經通令遵照、並限期擬具計劃呈核省會方面、並另設籌備委員會、聘請本地熱心十紳、共同襄助、對於第一步調查學齡兒實失學數目及妙名、已經調查消楚、共城區失學兒童約八三六七人、其中九足歲至十二足歲可入短期小學的兒童共三五八四人、可用的校舍、如公所·祠堂·庵廟·共有五十六處、可設六十學級左右、不足之數、尚須建築棚舍、或租用民房、關於進行步驟、也開了一次籌備委員會、議决開辦費推定冷禦秋陸小波嚴惠宇三先生負實籌借一萬五千元、其餘如决定設校地點、規劃校舍設備、徵求私人捐助校具敎具、委派校長、選任敎員、均有擬議和决定、對於强迫入學方法、也曾議有步驟、即第一步勸告、第二步榜示姓名予以警告、第三步罰金一元至五元、我們現在正根據計劃、按步進行、</p>
<p>此次中央和省方、都用全副力量、注重義務敎育的實施和推行、相信必可收到相當成效、不過經幾個月的雜劃、覺到最困難者、還是經費一端、好在根據上面的計劉、經當費是有着落的、剩下的問題只是開辦費和校舍校具的問題、開辦費規定勸募或攤派、這雖然似乎增加人民負擔、然而開辦費只要出一次就完了、不像經當費一樣要年年負擔、而且出一次錢、地方上多一級小學、於子弟上學是有便利的、所以希望地方人士踴躍捐助、大約每級開辦費、一百元就够了、每家出一元、一百家就可凑成百元、負擔也不能算重、至於校舍校眞、希望地方人士、一面能將祠堂廟宇、借作校舍一面能將家中不必要的棹椅捐助、我們就可因陋就簡的苦幹起來、我們黨政機關的同仁、如果能極力鼓吹提倡、我想社會上一定可以推動的、盼望大家努力、（完）</p>

<p>然後她設法使他肯把他所有苦難告訴了她，她自己的眼裏也垂淚而聽這小故事，雖然這於她巳不楚一個新鮮的故事了。</p>
<p>「我的孩子，你現在巳經得到了一個父親和一個母親，這就是你的家。不要再想到那種悲傷的情境，祇敎能够好起來，快快活活地；你一定不再吃苦，我們必定爲你盡力。這裏原來是爲了各種童子而設，在這裏要他們過着快樂的日子，並且逐漸能够自立，成爲有用的人，我希望。你儘可以從心所欲去玩着音樂，可是你總得先要强建強來。現在到納妥那邊去，洗了個澡，就去睡覺，到了明天我們可以共同决定一些有趣的小計畫一。</p>
<p>乃德緊緊執住她的手，也不講一句話，而祇讓他感激的眼色代他說話，同時裴夫人領他到一個大房間，在那裏他們見到一個强碩的德國婦人，臉兒圓肥而又愉怏得却像一個太陽，她所戴小帽的關邊，恰又似太陽光的幅射。</p>
<p>「這是胡納綏，她會給你洗一次爽爽快快的澡，爲你剪髮，使你一切都覺得舒舒服服，那邊就是洗澡問；在星期六的晚上我們先把小的孩子們一起擦過，趁大的孩子還在唱歌的時候，先將他們裝在床裏。現在，羅勃，先把你進去」。</p>
<p>裴夫人說話的時候，一忽兒已經把羅勃的衣服脫掉，將他推進到一個小房間裏的一個長盆裏去，那房間是連接着育兒室的。</p>

<h3>錢業市場凍滯不前</h3>
<p>自前日值星期日、全體金融界照例休假、無收解可紀、而不及疏理之手續、概歸昨日補行、故收解方面、比較往日略形優旺、然市塲中情形、已成呆板、洋拆終無高低、早午二角之日拆、巳成習慣、達一月有餘矣、良以目前拆票交易、少人競爭、又爲信用起見、一般自信力量單薄之錢莊、不敢貿然求折、宣其市塲形勢冷淡、價無升降、昨又　舊、早午仍爲二角、劃頭亦白劃無加水、小總會中亦無加减、一律白劃、拆票交易、早市轉帳二白七八十萬、新交易三十餘萬、午市交易四十餘萬、小總會交易七八十萬、洋押欵交易等取贖五十餘萬、新做出四十餘萬、鈔票收回八十餘萬、發出一百十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四千五百餘萬、洋劃頭爲收解四百四十餘萬、各路匯欵六七十萬、解現三四十萬、至於銀行收解、以前日併理、故收解較繁耳、外商銀行收解票欽百四、餘萬、各種貨匯押墊雜欵收解四百八九十萬、電匯欵八十餘萬、入超欵收入一百五十餘萬、外匯結價欵八十餘萬、特匯欵一百十餘萬、進倉八十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百四五十萬、各種貨匯押稅雜欵收解五百〇數萬、電匯欵一百餘萬、特匯欵五十餘萬、外匯結價欵九十餘萬、代各商業行號解人超額二百五六十萬、出倉一百萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百五六十萬各種貨匯雜欵收解五百三四十萬、外滙結價欵五十餘萬、特滙欵三十餘萬、入欵一百餘萬、電滙欵七十餘萬、進倉四十萬、又票據交換所票據總激、銀元一千二百七十三萬四千五百零六元六角二分、內計交換總數銀元四百九十萬零一千七百十三元九角、滙劃銀元四百二十萬零一千六白五十八元六角七分、代收總數錢業二百四十三萬五千三百三十二萬零三分、其他一百十九萬五千八百零二元零二分、</p>

<h3>證劵　公債多頭似在掉期　各項起伏互見…上落尚微</h3>
<p>昨華商設券交易所、因經紀人方面之要求、半日交易繼續延長一星期、故市面仍祇拍上午兩盤、市况形勢依然沉悶而呆滯、惟大戶進出較見起色、四十八號吸收遠期、胃暈頗濃、上午開盤、形勢本有下挫之勢、賴此維持、竟能緩步邁升、不過三十三號售出近期、似覺甚湧、致市面一般人又抱疑慮論調、謂三十三號之貨色、恐係四千八號多頭掉期所託代售者、人心又起懷疑、次盤市價因之又告回落、總之目下四十八號進出已隱然有左右市面能力、良以檯面帽子交易、大都唯其馬首是瞻也、前途形勢、一時恐難有軒輊也、昨市結果、仍屬上落互見、成交總額共七百六十一萬元、茲將其高低結果列比較表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　期紗市況轉變無常</h3>
<p>紗市又轉疲弱、上日以盛傳某方有收貨二千包說、突然上騰、今則市塲空氣轉變、多方恐無收貨之意、目茶紗有一千件交解、而多頭有出籠模樣、於是市勢忽挫、盤盤下墜、近日紗市乍起乍降、殊難捉摸、但現紗銷路、較形活動、各帮如能繼續而來、與市面當可援助不少、</p>
<p>金　轉跌</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月一致下跌、形勢大爲鬆懈、因海外棉業暗淡、上日市塲浮言、謂某君在本月收貨之說、目前難事實尚遠、某紗反有交出之可能、又有一說五百件、業已解入倉庫中、於是市氣星散、多方亦有了結、惟大孚代漢口帮買進三千四百包、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一元二·三·四·五角、午後開盤、聞上午客方銷塲尚佳、較前爲暢、人氣略振、各月微漲二·三角、但拍至一二收盤、市象又見鬆動、因多頭繼續了結、結果各月比上午收盤價又跌一·二·四角、查賣出浴大一千一百包、大豐四百包、畏豐一千四百包、恒昌二千四百五十包、同和五百包、仁豐五百五十包、大昌成四百包、潤康四百包、貿進大孚三千四百五十包、愼記六百五十包、振大四百包、泰興八百包、昶記四百包、瑞大八百包、長餘四百包、長豐四百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>遠期花甬帮跑賣</h3>
<p>棉市八月期尚挺、多方軋空之念甚切、據市塲言、某大銀行有交貨一萬擔之說、遠期新棉、寗波帮拋賣較巨、形勢稍萎云、</p>
<p>本月花獨呈挺秀</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、八月期仍堅、因多方關閉不放、且意態緊決看高、惟還月新花甬帮頃關節空、心想看小、兼之標金在九百元左右盤旅、人心平疲、結果本月比上日收　價跌一角半、遠跌三角半四角、午後開盤八月期頗堅、暗中賣戶缺乏、遠月帶起、拍至收盤稍平、結果八月期比上午收盤價漲二角半、遠漲五分至角半、查賣出賡豐一千五百擔、通記一千擔、仁豐四千七百擔、長豐一千二百擔、潤康三千六百擔、源興昌六千擔、同和一千六百擔、貿進大孚七千六百擔、源大一千六百擔、昶記千擔、元一一千一百擔、泰昌一千一百擔、益昶一千四百擔、生源一千六百擔、長和三千二百擔，潤康一千二百擔、新　一千八百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>原棉廠　寥寥無幾</p>
<p>現棉消費仍滯、廠需　　來源到姚花</p>
<h3>印棉收成狀況順利</h3>
<p>上週期貨市塲最令人注意者、爲七八月期白羅溪花之仃力、蓋白羅溪花交貨僅四千包、大部均爲本地著名棉商所收、出口問訊極少、現棉基礎較佳、惟因質地太硬、營業大受影響、廠家進胃平常、收成狀况、一致順利、有一部份略嫌雨水過多、而需日光、附錄上週統　如下、（單位千包）</p>
<h3>糧食　期粉晨市買氣殊密</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤、各月份市面、均呈昂俏、洋麥報價、芝加哥雖小三四五角左右、坎拿大小二角零、惟市塲人心、則一致堅挺、因謠傳各廠方面、鑒於小麥進貨不易、有停車之說、一方面又有洋麥統制之傳聞、是以外行空戶、頗見皇恐、抵補甚力、業外多頭、亦步步搶進、故買戶甚暢、上午做二四十萬包、市面漲二三分不等，迨至下午、各月份交易轉淸、又因津帮之開出、市氣微呈軟弱、較上午跌半分至七釐半、照月下情形、囤麥到貨、甚難豐暢、洋麥又一時難劃、故看穩固之局、結果本月份絞好一分一釐半、九十月份漲二分、十一十一月份漲一分七釐半、一月份漲二分二釐半、</p>
<h3>期麥人心一致看高　—高貨小麥開至七角外—</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤價、各月份均見一致關漲、以洋麥雖報小二三四五角不等、惟以現洋麥因滙兌低縮、久不合劃、故在事實方面易使多方挺住、近則內地麥價、步步跟好、滬寗及江北一帶、高貨合申、均須七八角左右、有此印象、人心遂挺貴異常、各月份開價、即好三五分不等、下午開盤、交易積淸、市呈平穩、不過業中人心思、　然看穩、結果本月份漲五分、九月份漲四分、十月份至一月份各好三分、現麥市面、續見昂貴、高貨開至七角外、中關貨亦帶起三五分、開明光管店麥三元七角二分、東台高郵麥三元六角七分、六合麥三元六角三分、揚州麥三元六角一分、次六角、南京麥三元四角七分、烏衣麥三元六角半、山福新去六千包、</p>
<h3>杜洋米俱見修削</h3>
<p>本米（滬南）昨日各都來源與前相仿、仍共到二十餘號、（貨共四千餘石）銷塲則本街已較　動、包　亦續有烟　等都辦四百餘包、大局形勢略能轉平、而呈定中帶緊之狀、結果各厚粳次薄稻等行情、中市貨見修數分、高料者悉已站住、東新則天晴繼跌二尺、陰變元亦以供過於求、貶低角許、蘆尖則隨粳略定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各帮來源十六七號、市上各種去胄、白粳早市去路仍滯、價短一二角、午市零化轉活、致價定勢、早稻銷路淡弱、價削一三角、簿稻亦小角外、後市均已轉定、東新到千二三百石、零拆平常、價小一角、白元零化呆木、價疲角外、浙路新尖到雖不多、零銷滯細、價見修削、其餘各貨、亦小角許、</p>
<p>洋米昨日市况、客化轉淡、漢口九江泉州南京各帮均未間津、成交數銳减、高次各檔一律有趨跌之勢、惟行囤以成本高昂、定貨不劃、而申地浮存亦不足二十萬包、故仍堅持不賤脫、惟小囤戶頗有求脫、市面終見軟弱數分、抵前羅碎米有天津與內地爭辦、市價仍得站住、西貢小絞後有本街內地趁平收買、市價亦復轉定、全日開出西貢二千五百五十包、暹遞一千七百包、小紋高貢等七百包、甬江次機米八十包、行情均與前市相近、祇骨裏已爲帶軟云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粵粗白標售千餘包</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金略鬆、稍現軟象、糖業合作公司、標售五羊粗白一千五百包、價為十七元零五分、成交一千包、又稍次莊一千一百四十八包、十六元八角半、成交一百四十包、均比小五分、又中砂白一千包、十六元四角、成交六十包、公會劃二死粗砂白現貨及轉口貨、均呌原價未成交、太古糖B麥小去五分、為十八元零五分、本廠棉白糖變動、號盤有潮幫開出黃崗靑百數包、九元九角、又陳枝赤百數十包、九元七角、東白亦小五分、四號為十六元四角、八號十六元二角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　廈橘餅回漲三元</h3>
<p>廈門橋餅、前以銷胃稀少、開價最小曾到二十一元、但終以虧本過甚、餘貨均堅守未卸、茲值秋銷轉動、價乃逐步轉升、昨市已到二十四元半、前後升三元許、惟陳次貨仍疲、較好者不及十元、</p>
<h3>油市　漢市柏油暢銷價漲　—本市售盤亦公議增高—</h3>
<p>柏油秋銷正在發重各處行家均須採辦各牌貨品、以供燭淘之需求、本埠各行家所經營之油、素以鄂省荊宜一帶所產者爲主體、惟並不向產地直接辦貨、係向漢口行家辦來、故漢市本爲集中之市塲、但近來時有由宜昌輪船直運滬上銷售者、所以申市亦有荊油客貨運到、且因產地直運、合算價格、每較由漢市辦來者爲廉、而滬上行家亦樂於購辦、然漢市因此到貨漸少、辦者亦較從前爲稀矣、斯亦市塲上之變化、今慶漢市存積較往年更薄、故遇有採辦、即起漲風、最近在漢鎭寗蘇滬等帮均欲購辦、而漢行無此巨數供給、所存客貨、須向客家議盤、乃客人見辦者稍多、即居奇漲價、重荊由每砠十二兩起繼續增加至十三兩六錢、麻城油最低祇十一兩四錢、現巳加至十二兩八七錢矣、漲風之起、由於各帮搶辦、然均係備底、並非有眞實銷塲發動、故辦者見已漲起如許、咸將縮手再待時機、惟旣漲之後、一時不易見鬆、本埠行家、因見漢市大漲、故售盤亦公議加增、開重荊每砠二十二元二四角、平荊二十二元至二十一元六八角、麻城油須十九元市秤、</p>

<h3>為藝術的藝術與為人生的藝術</h3>
<p>— 徐懋席</p>
<p>「為藝術的藝術」的，只講「技巧的美」的純文學，不但自身的理論顯得不大純粹，即在事實上，它也沒有什麽地位。古往今來世界的讀者所公認的偉大的文學作品，根本沒有那樣架空的東西存在，旡論矣；還有，兩紀德（Ancre　Gide）的回憶文中所說的王爾德的事情，也可以知道一點消息。</p>
<p>王爾德是唯美主義的倡導者，是主張藝術應該從人生游離，應該從人生超脫的人，更極端的讚揚快樂，他蹉嘆「架空」（Lying）的頽廢，又說：「一切惡藝術都從復歸於自然和人生而產生。」然而當他為了唯美的生活而進了監獄，看到眞實的人生之後，他的唯美主義就破滅了。他自認先前的唯知追求美，追求快樂的心是「頑石一般的心，」而這一頑石一般的心」却被一種呌做「同情」的東西所打碎了。他因為談到陀斯委益夫斯基的作品，而說了如下的話；</p>
<p>「俄國的作家是很出色的。便他們的作品成為那樣偉大的，那是他們寓在作品裏面的同情。從前我不是很愛讀波華荔夫人（Maame　Bovary）的麽，然而佛羅貝爾不願把同情放進他的作品裏面，因此他的作品只顯得小氣，狹窄；同情是使得作品開展，顯得偉大的。」（參看譯文二卷二期王爾德「文）</p>
<p>把對於佛羅貝爾的愛好移轉到俄國作家身上，主張在作品裏面放進同情，這就是宣吿着「為藝術的藝術」的唯美主義到底屈服於「為人生的藝術」了。</p>
<p>愛好佛羅貝爾的時候的王爾德，是反對左拉的，他在架空的頽廢中說：</p>
<p>「從藝術的見地看來，左拉的作品差不多全旡價値，只配得零分。他的作品中的人物，都是頽廢而可憐的人們。罪惡之結晶的人們。這些人物的生涯，是毫旡興味的紀錄。誰能對這些人去注意呢？我們對於藝術的要求，是珍奇，魅力和想像，史間單地說，美而已矣。」</p>
<p>左拉和佛羅貝爾的差異，原來就是「為人生的藝術」和「為藝術的藝術」的差異。佛羅貝爾的　實主義雖然不離人生的現實，却又說「人生虛旡，藝術才是一切，」他也將藝術自身當作唯一的絕對者，而人生，在他只是一種照着描寫的模型。在左拉的自然主義的寫實態度的根底裏，却對於人生懷着同情，所以有着改造社會的理想主義。在這一點，左拉是比佛羅貝爾更接近俄國作家的。王爾德當愛好佛羅貝爾的時候，反對左拉，那是當然的事。但當認識了同情，嫌憎了佛羅貝爾的小氣，狹窄之後，他對於左拉，也要改變態度，撤回如上的批語的罷—這也是當然的。</p>
<p>同情的有無，是「為人生的純藝」和「為藝術的藝術」即純文學的根本的區別。</p>
<p>羣衆文學首先當然應該是「為人生的藝術」，它必須有同情。然而，並不能說一切「為人生的藝術」的文學都是羣衆文學。</p>
<p>譬如：描寫了貧窮的，被霖躪的，飢餓的人們的藝術，是寓着同情的「為人生的藝術」，這樣的藝術，至今為止，是已經很多了。在向然主義運動以後的文學上描寫工人和農夫者，尤其不遑枚舉。然而，不能是因為描寫了工人和農夫，便說大衆文學。這是什麼緣故呢？是因為作者用了旁觀者的誤用憐，或特殊者的理解那樣的眼睛夾眺望，來描寫的緣故，是因為在作者，並無大衆本身那樣的共通意識乃至嬰求的緣故</p>
<p>譬如：作為訴說生活環境的惡劣，而徒然覺得不平，抱怨無窮，乖頭喪氣，這樣的作品，當然也是寓着同情的「為人生的藝術」。然而，作者不能指敎出對現實的積極態度，對生活的勞動及意志的鍜鍊，新的生活形態，建設的熱意，憎惡那些困難與苦惱同被我們克服的不良遺產——舊世界等等的緣故。</p>
<p>譬如：描寫人類的心理，發掘靈魂的秘密，顯示人類的野蠻和自私的本能之勝利，或指出人性的本質的善良，這也是寓着消極或積極的同情的「如人生的藝術」、而這也不能說是大衆文學，為什麽呢？可是他方面作者，只以宗敎的，倫理的，哲學的態度，描寫了個人的心理，却無視於决定一切個人心理底社會的和歷史的態度，這是其缺點。</p>
<p>還有純文學因為唯求「技巧的美」，所以專務雕琢，矯揉造作，多用誇張的隱喩或奇怪的古代文字，使讀者難懂；並且」為藝術的藝術」的純文學，是要超脫現實的世界，單憑技巧描說架空的美以為滿足。「為人生的藝術」的自然派文學，是將世界樣樣地說明，樣樣地描寫，樣樣地嘗味。大衆文學，有其理想。這是最要緊區別之點。</p>
<h3>麻雀與灶蟣</h3>
<p>— 漁</p>
<p>從事文藝的人，早已有人斷定他們的不如鞋匠屠戶，理髪匠的有用；也許正因為他們沒有用的原故，所以社會的待遇他們的微薄，也可相而知了。人不是麻雀，但他們却得做麻雀一樣住在屋頂，人不是一個灶蟣，但他們卻得像灶　一樣啃麵包皮的碎屑。永遠有屋頂可住，永遠有麵包皮碎屑可啃，他們的注意力，也許不至於專注在這上面，但我們要知道，事實上是今天住了屋頂，明天有得住沒得住，或者這一個月有得住屋頂，下一個月有得住沒得住，天有麵包皮碎屑可啃，明天有沒有得啃，或者今這一個月有麵包皮可啃，下一個月有沒有得啃，對於他們却是個嚴重得並不怎樣小的問題。講從事文藝沒有藝術的良心，這是對於他們一種汚蔑，一切藝術家，都忠於他們的藝術，努力向上的，他們有雄心，他們都如Kleist一樣，想把詩人的桂冠，從別人的頭上摘下來戴到自己頭上去。可是為籌劃明天的麵包，為籌劃明天的住屋，他們就不得不多寫一點，而換取微薄的稿費。這是由於飢餓的壓迫，不得不如此，並不一定出於他們的自願。壓榨出來的苦汁，壓榨出來的汗水，只求有銷路，自然顧不得什麽「曲」呀「直」呀「幽雅」呀「典麗」呀。這是那些生活優裕少數有閑文藝家的事，而他們不暇顧到此也無這樣經濟能力可以顧到這樣的事。因為他們旣住的像麻雀一樣的屋頂，他們呼的空氣是汚濁的，他們連一片靑的草地，也不能看見，什麽花圍別墅，更談不上，汚濁的衖堂，走出來的襤褸污穢的人物，這樣的環境，和這樣環境中的人物，靈感旣是無從從外面來，飢火却又從裏面燒出去，拿起一枝筆來寫，這是有所為而寫，這就根本失去「閒適」的條件，再加之沒有雪茄可抽，沒有咖啡可喝，甚至連苦茶一杯，也不能到手，然而也只好寫，寫，不停地寫，寫得手不能動彈了，兩手搖一搖，這就算舒筋骨，頭向外張一張，這就算透空氣，眼向對面瓦上看一看，這就算散散心，如此而已。這樣環境下所寫成的文章，自沒有高貴的仕女，作其中的典型的人物，沒有富麗堂皇的自然背景，作為其中描寫的對象，沒有講心靈的古書，作其中的引襯，於是那些「閉適飄逸」古趣盎然的有閑藝術家們看到這樣的文章，就要頭痛，就要覺得趣味索然，認為中國雜誌新聞，一無可觀，而只有那些給公子哥兒閒適人們看的圖畫雜誌，最合於他們的趣味了。</p>
<h3>可以居里（下）</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>那叫慕老，蓮老的急忙拉　笑臉灣幾灣腰，彷彿阿根那股勁的，退到旁邊的桌子上。</p>
<p>阿根自然又是仲手　擱板上去摸這個那個的自備水壺。他放茶葉的時候，偷偷地斜眼向這邊瞥着，阿根賺銅鈿是聰明的，他想多放在史老爺茶壺里的代代花要從這兩位爺們身上收回來。並且他知道即是他們辨出茶味來，在史董事面前是不敢發作的。</p>
<p>他們却談起話來了，阿根不生耳朶也知道是這些事；先是一陣子天氣晴呀雨的呌人頭昏腦服，接着是稻的收穫——他們都是五家鎭上的大田主，他們挺關心的就是這些事，今天行里掛牌幾元幾角，他們就不會報錯一分。阿根總是小相信他們的路數，幾次打烊後到行里去問朋友，總是想不出那一關係一他們沒有一點兒差池。歸根他槌着自己的腦袋，他想自家的腦袋里一定裝錯了東西。</p>
<p>他把茶壺放到兩位爺們桌上，又替史老爺冲滿了，回過頭來瞻太陽，已經曬到門檻里面。八點鐘了，阿根想警吿史老爺要不要吃燒餅。</p>
<p>但是他們談得很起勁，談過米行情，慕老談起陸家的大兒子回來了。人是變得胖胖的，穿上洋鬼子的衣服，走路很威風。「並日聽說帶回來兩口大箱子」、慕老也是有史董事這一手的，聲音壓成糞缸上的蒼蠅那樣嗡嗡的『他老子特地昨晚上請我吃飯哩」。</p>
<p>在平常史董事一定跳了起來，慕老是什麽東西，陸家里敢不請我史董事吃飯！但是史董事今天全改了樣，他隨和地笑了笑說：「我昨天聽見還不信這回事。那孩子不知到底那個樣子」？</p>
<p>「董事，眞叫人不相信呢」！連老撿來說。他咋大也是陸家的賓客，他覺得慕老沒有說他進去是失面子的事，就故意提高半個音：「陸全福昨天也硬拉了我去，阿興到外面兜過一圈，憶變了一個人，他很懂得禮貌。在席上他說起上海，漢口，南京，他到　許許多多地方，他說做着一筆生意，有上萬銀子的好處呢，那末小小的年紀眞是虧他的……」蓮老說溜了嘴，他忽然覺得腰眼里被誰揍了一下，慕老　向他做着限風。於是他才看淸史董事的眼睛像胃着火燄一般地難看，一時不知怎樣來收篷，就是的是的是了半天，拉來一句「那孩子也問董事好」。</p>
<p>蓮老心里雖然着急，但是他覺得自己的謊話很聰明。</p>
<p>其實史董事沒有把全股兒的話聽進去，他證實了陸阿興回來後，他的整個腦袋在阿根所猜想不出的「關係」上轉念頭了，那是史董事當年的得意傑作：他要呑沒陸全福的一塊　面的時候，阿興小鬼居然要打倒我史某，（那時候他自然不是董事）土豪劣紳什麽的，一時間幾乎栽倒在一個孩子手里。但是史某不是那樣容易栽斛斗的，他的一寸來長的指甲有　奏地敲過幾個桌面，他已經堂堂的史董事，而阿興的名字却混在×××的名字里，嚇得他連夜逃走。這一件事史董事在酒酣耳熱之際，他總抹着兩撇不成樣的鬚子，不厭求詳地向他老婆十遍百遍地講一個沒有休止的時候。</p>
<p>現在史董事想着眼睛里就冒了火，這小鬼挺神氣地回五家鎭了，發了兩大口箱子的洋財，請蓮老慕老吃夜飯，俺史董事不希罕這些！可是這小鬼來　不明，史董事忘了吃燒餅還不是　了「深思遠慮」？腦袋就自然地鼓動起來，一寸來長的指甲在桌面上敲着，不過亂了拍子，彷彿打翻　一個麻雀窠那樣吱吱　唧。</p>
<p>蓮老猜不透董事或許詩興勃發，抑是自己說溜了話？向慕老翻了個白眼，斯文地端起茶杯來呷了口滾熱的茶，才把那　要跳出來的心歸了窠。</p>
<p>阿根本來不明白那此「派頭」的，現在更像站在哈哈鏡前面</p>
<p>般地拍着後腦壳，里面一定裝錯了東西，他嚕咕着。</p>
<p>猛地史董事的手掌在桌面上搥了下，這是他的失檢，慕老蓮老就比不得阿根，這是有失「體統」的事，急忙拉開了笑臉，說：</p>
<p>「這是陸家祖上積德，也是五家鎭的幸福！」表示得意似的接連在桌面上搥了二下，「這孩子變好了，我停會倒要去</p>
<p>這樣，兩位湊趣的爺們彷彿患了流行性感冒和着搥　桌子。</p>
<p>史董事之為史董事，這手是旁人及不來的地方。</p>
<p>談話吿了個段落，阿根猜不透的「關係」在史董事肚理也告了個段落，「可以居」里暫時沉默下來，三個讀書人斯文地呷着茶，阿根注意着慕老，蓮老的嘴巴，他想，要是他兩辦不出茶味來，明天可以更少放點代代茶。轉賺錢的念頭，阿根的腦袋里沒有裝錯東西。</p>
<p>太陽曬進門檻又退了出去，阿根打起手照向街心估計着已　敲過五點。他心里還牢記着史老爺沒有吃燒餅，現在有着機會，他咳了聲嗽，這不是「派頭」，他想引起史老爺的注意，拉着動人的調子喊：「阿根，做兩個燒餅來！」</p>
<p>但是史老爺的注意力完全放到那個猜不透的「關係」上去了，雖然她槌過桌子，敲過指甲，不過一個「深思遠慮」的董事，他要「三思而行」的，那孩子來歷不明，在沒有去「看看他」之前，他無論如何想不起來今天沒有吃過燒餅。</p>

<h3>海邊的悲劇（二）</h3>
<p>— 法國巴爾扎克原著王堅生譯</p>
<p>儘管白天的溽暑逼人，和長途跋涉的疲勞，我們的靈魂中仍然充滿着難以描摹的熱烈快樂的神態，牠們充滿了純潔的歡樂，這種純潔的歡樂的表現，只有一個人當他傾聽悠揚的音樂，如莫柴的「讓我們去吧我的愛人」那秤名曲才能彷彿。二個靈魂融和於一種純潔的思想中，正如二個美妙的聲音和諧於歌曲中一樣。</p>
<p>你要想完全了解後來的侵襲我們的情感，你必參與我們在早晨漫遊所獲得的那種放從的快樂。如果你坐下一會兒，看看一隻棲息在橫在小河上面樹枝上的各種濃淡不勻的鮮麗的顏色的野鴿，當你看見她給老鷹的鐵爪陷入心中，以火藥驅子彈出槍口那般，迅速掠載而去時，你必將悲顫失聲。</p>
<p>我們不久走到一個小石洞，小石洞的前面，矗立着一狹窄的巖礁，拔海一百尺，前面復有一塊般石的峭壁，擋住了汹湧的波浪，在我們剛爬上了石台二步，我們感到一秤觸電般的抖顫經過我們的身上，正如深夜中、個人給一個突發的貴聲驚動樣。</p>
<p>我瞥見坐在一塊盤石上的那個人，注視着我們。</p>
<p>他從紅腫的眼巢中迸射也來的一瞥，正如砲彈的閃光一樣。他的四肢麻木似的一動也不動，正如他坐在當中的那幾條花崗石柱一樣。他的身體一直堅硬不動，好像他巳變成石頭一樣，只有他的眼還遲緩的移動着。在他向我們看了一眼，使我們深深地感動以後，他遂把眼光移開，注視着那展開在他脚前的汪洋的海。雖然水面上有向上閃射着的强光，他也目不轉瞬地凝望着，好像人家所說的老鷹翹望太陽一樣。他沒有再抬起眼來。我的親愛的叔叔，你可以假定有這末一棵被時間剝光的橡樹的老梢，它的丫節的樹幹仍把它的奇異的形狀豎立於寂寞的大道之傍，那樣的形狀，就是這一個人的逼眞的肖像。軀幹是像毀滅中的海克士的軀幹，他的面孔，如　靈辟克的修十神一般，被年齡，粗惡的食物，海上生活的辛勞所殘傷，正如給電流燒焦了一樣。我凝望他的粗糙的多毛的雙手，我看見如鐵鍊一般的筋肉。在他的全軀之中，現露着同樣天賦的氣力的記號。</p>
<p>在小石洞的一角我瞥見了一大堆蘇苔和花崗石面上天然成功的一種粗糙的石架，在石架上放着一隻泥壺，四而散佈着圓麵包的碎屑。我的想像，——即使會神遊於那第一代基敎的隱士住在沙漠，從沒有引起這樣一幅崇高的宗敎的圖畫，或者這樣一塲可怕的懺悔。從然是你，我的親愛的叔父，對於懺悔的教徒。有經騐，也從未見過這株一個高尙的懺悔心，這兒的懺悔心，是沉浸於祈禱的，永遠沉默失望的祈禱的波瀾中的。</p>

<h3>印子錢</h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>前日報載居滬西草棚內之鹽城人徐振銀，拉車為生，其妻陳氏，以乃夫所入甚微，生活艱困，乃秘向陳鴻銘借得印子錢，現陳逼討甚急，氏以無法償還，頓萌厭世之念，背人懸樑自縊，迨夫察覺，已氣絕冰冷，當卽投報警所，傳同陳鴻銘解局訊辦。</p>
<p>本來以經濟壓迫而自殺者，日必數起，社會轟傳的救濟方法甚多，不管其結果如何，要亦母用多所曉舌，然而這一事件，死者實無異死於放印子錢者之手，茲就，「印子錢」一事，略為伸論。筆者鄕下有一流行歌謠，略謂「高利貨，印子錢，吃人的猛獸，殺人的利劍」，從這幾句話中足見印子錢為害之慘而且烈，許多人都在這一「超經濟剝削」下，被迫致死，記得從前政府以「印子錢」無異掠奪，曾有明文，加以禁止，但是禁者自禁，在飢寒交迫中的人，仍然只有去嘗試這含毒的苦劑。</p>
<p>卽以上海而論，不管你甚麼工商業發達，但印子錢仍然在那些草棚區貧民窟等地潛長勢燄。普通借印子錢一元，每日利息至少銅元三枚，多至五枚，且必須逐日繳息，否則利上加利。以此計算，每年利錢，竟有原本兩三倍以上之多，這種榨取行為，實在過於殘忍。償還吧，每日求能果腹尙且不易，何能一時有此能力，不償還吧，則這種長期重利，對自己簡直是敲骨吸髓。加以常常飢寒逼來，又得重借新債，債愈積愈多，債愈多則償還更不容易，因此有許多這樣輾轉於飢餓綫下的人們，便作了放印子錢之吸血者的長期牛馬。這一非人掠取，眞不知演了幾多慘劇，造成了多少的罪惡。徐陳氏的投環自縊，殆不過為無數印子錢盤剝下犧牲者之一而已。</p>
<h3>黃昏</h3>
<p>— 方殷</p>
<p>我愛黃昏，然而，當黃昏快要降臨時，我却又有些害怕：我怕它存在得那麽短剎，我怕那跟踪着它而來的夜魔，我怕，我怕！我怕它是象徵着太陽之隕落，一個末日的降臨。</p>
<p>在天之邊掛上了一抹殷紅的霞彩，我疑心：這兒會隱藏着殷涔涔的血液——這不是野獸的血，而是羔羊的血哪！——這血液記載着一天以來底兇殘的戰蹟。</p>
<p>我馳想，也許會在天邊的霞采里，透露一些兒光明，然而，這可不是在傍晚，而是在那經過一夜的搏戰，慢慢地溜出黑暗之網的朝噋。</p>
<p>現在，黃昏又將到來了。我望着天，凝視着那火盤似底紅日之西面。</p>
<p>鴉雀在林間嘈亂地歸了巢，田野間的牧歌凄麗地流散着，是羊羣，是耕牛的歸隊，是一天底疲勞后之太息。</p>
<p>望望天，望望乾枯的田野，無數晒焦了的臉蛋掛滿者憂愁，無無給重荷壓鬱了的背，分明從天邊是找不出絲毫的電影了……</p>
<p>烟囪止住它漆黑的濃煙，人們帶著一張菜黃色的臉，拖著疲憊了的雙腿，從工廠裏溜了出來，像是羊羣，也是耕牛的歸隊。一大羣，一大羣整天消度在煤氣底室息下底人們。他們整天見不到太陽，只有到黃昏時分，才得瞥了一眼夕陽的霞采。然而，當一天的疲勞還沒有恢復的時侯，聽着汽笛跟狼叫似底吼了一聲，人們又得從黑夜裏倔强地掙扎起來，在黎明之前鑽進那無底的深洞裏去。……</p>
<p>我怕黃昏，我愛黃昏，……我希圖在黃昏中找到一些兒寗靜，在黑夜之前舒了一口疲憊的氣息。……</p>
<p>但，在都市底角落裏流連着那一批；永遠不管你是黃昏，黑夜，還是白日的人羣？他們伸着隻骯髒的手去討求着別人底憐息，用千萬句恭維的話語去乞取些殘肴，希望賣不去的氣力跟一條渺小的生命能够暫且俄延。他們不管是白天，黑夜，或黃昏，老是不斷地作着這種乞討的持續，然後，才在永無一定的街角裏，抱住個乾癟的肚子去睡眠。</p>
<p>這兒不是寗靜，而是永無止境的哀號與呻吟！</p>
<p>我不忍聽着哀號的哭聲。我驚駭渲染得那末鮮紅的霞采，我害怕這樣的黃昏。但，我却又需要在這之間，去找尋一刻兒的寗靜。</p>
<p>我曾經抱著一顆受傷的心，從老遠沙漠裏走到海之涯，我跟乞丐樣討乞，俄延者這條半死的生命，我比任何人更明白我自己，明白我自己需要生存</p>
<p>惡魔用那兇殘的爪抓緊了我，他要把我驅向那些老死，夭亡的人們底後頭，緊迫我從黃昏之中，跌到那死城似底黑夜裏去。</p>
<p>然而，我不願沉落，我不願死亡，我還得掙扎，從這個黃昏又到那黃昏。我知道：在黃昏之前是白晝，在黑夜之後就是黎明。但我，但我的年紀還不曾到暮靄的時候，我得掙脫這個爪牙，帶着負傷的身體，過了一個黃昏又黃昏，</p>
<p>是的，我在黃昏裏曾經得過一回溫柔的撫慰，一陣海風吹甦了我底昏迷，可是一當黃昏消逝了時，夜魔又來追捕我了。我又將繼續着去奪取第二個黎明</p>
<p>晚風吹起了衣角，太陽漸漸地在山幻間沉落了。我追，我奔，我飛跑，我要拯住那個被吞沒了的太陽。可是我在山坳間跌倒了，我沒有奪回我們的太陽，我受了傷，慢慢地拖若受傷的身體，又在峋嶙的山野間爬了起來。</p>
<p>從此，我更害怕，像這樣的黃昏。</p>
<p>然而，當我從白天的勞動中疲憊到像垂死一樣無力時，我倒又覺得黃昏是澀柔，是寗靜而可愛了。所以，我不得不愛黃昏，然而却又害怕黃昏……</p>
<h3>畫趣</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>看畫，有兩種看法，漫畫扉畫之類的小品製作，是只能在私房里外裝卸下的朝晚，或在臥榻上睡前醒後的時候，纔能玩味到畫中眞味。這類小品畫在看之外，且還帶有讀的風趣，實不僅在官能的滿足。巨幅大軸的畫，尤其是中畫的屛條，只能掛在擺設堂皇的客堂里，情調上纔能得到調和。但這些東西也只止於看玩，讀的風趣萬說不到。古人雖曾推崇王摩結的畫里有詩，這也許是摩詰的畫合於那時代人的生活情調的緣故。在輪船火車，西裝革履的生活情調的現代，那種古代的生活情調當然難能存在於我們的生活里。</p>
<p>只是，今人筆下製作出來的國畫，情調又全與現代生活互異，背景必山林烟雨，流水小橋，人物必高　寬袍的耕樵隱者：仕女必螓首蛾眉削肩細腰。以現代人作出古代情調的畫品，可眞奇怪之至，有人說中國人的模仿性高於創作性，或此謂然歟？假使有人復謂道正足以表現東方人的精神思想，那又不免令人有「匪夷所思」之感了。</p>
<p>說到這里就不能不叫我推崇豐子愷先生的畫，以中國人的筆觸，綫條，情感來描劃現代中國人的生活情調；雖止</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>屬小品的製作，但其在藝術的表現功能上，實非那些「國畫」之類可能同日而語。</p>
<p>到團體機關或私人舉行的美術展覽會塲合去看畫展，在我，也是會感到這是一種情趣上的殺害。看到一些水腫樣的人體製作，心里就起一陣不自在。藝術的性能固然帶有誇張强調的成份，可也不能流於過火。這些人體畫雖說來自西方，我可不忍哄騙自己，說這纔算美的畫作，畫幅之一角的標價也頗使人難於逼視的，旣然要拿畫作來充實肚子，就爽爽直直說賣畫罷了，何必定要美其名曰畫展。我這樣說並不是譏笑畫家以畫作賣錢是可恥的卑下事。現代的生活方式原趨流於商品化複雜化的尖端的了。這不能不使人想到巴黎街頭的「畫丐」，他們身外無長物，只用幾枝粗劣粉的筆，在光滑的馬路上，寫出自己的作品，博路人一些施捨。這樣的賣畫方式雖說可憐一些，他們的爽直洒脫倒値得人欽敬。</p>
<p>琴棋書畫是前代文人的家常便飯，而且能文而不能琴，能棋，能書，能畫，又絕不能躋於才子雅人之列的。至以以此玩藝而作進身之階，這自然另有說法。轉看今世文人畫者，又有幾個能文兼畫，能畫兼文的？不過，這可不能說是今人不如前人的證據。反之，用科學眼光說來，倒是今代藝術的進步表現。機械文明孕育出社會生產方式不能不採取分工制；而生息今世的文人畫者，自然只有各究其藝以終其身了。而必謂不能屬文的畫者的製作就遠不如古，是絕對說不通的。自然，中國人之重古輕今，不特藝術如是。古的必好，今的必壞，已成為批評的準則。幾多收藏家之不可一世，古畫古刻之價値連城。然我相信他們的寳貴古物，可少有完全為着藝術的趣味，或者企圖在那里抽理出含蘊在古畫古刻里面的社會意義來的。他們熱中古畫的趣味是什麽呢，是為的這是前代的東西呀。今世國畫家之必兢兢以古法為準繩，其少創作性與力外，這也許是原因之一罷。</p>
<p>有人說，將來的藝術必然歸返到大衆手里，成為大衆自己的東西。這說法固無錯處，但我想這可也是後幾世代的事罷。大衆的生活，敎養，和這理想都還有着很遠的距離。今日的大衆决不能在水腫樣的人體畫和山林隱者的國畫里尋到自己的趣味；而有着藝術敎養的藝人，也决不屑去欣賞百美圖或劍俠傳之類的連環圖畫。大衆所需要的可就是這類的東西！徒然高喊高調的理論家，實都未免心急一些的。</p>
<p>時下漫畫製作之流行一時，不能說不是因其能抓取一部分大衆的趣味。這現象是値得喜悅的。以中國人的筆觸，情威，綫條，去描畫現代中國人的生活情調，這是要希望我們的畫家多多努力的。</p>
<h3>暮宿荒村</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>我沒有計劃過水程有多少路，但是為了路幹一件緊要的事，就貿貿然的要到長沙去跑一趟，然而一打聽近來却沒有便船東上。就坐了一隻開往長沙的石子船。</p>
<p>趁石子船也有一種習慣，就是祗要是同鄉，他們非但絕對不受船資，酒力，並且還要貼飯給乘客吃，不過他們是不常開船的，因此要去趁著他們的船是很難得的。</p>
<p>在晨風中携了一伴僅有的行篋！皮包，我匆忙地下了船，那隻船身就緩緩地離開了埠頭，因為船身太笨重，航行得十分遲迂。我這有心事的人，坐在裏面實在覺焦灼，但焦灼有些什麽用呢？船是一步不行一步不到的。沒有辦法，祇好在船面上觀望觀望湖中的風景，或者和船上人講講白話；這樣一來，把我那顆不安的心也就平了下來。</p>
<p>「今天風是順風，可情沒有方，」船主人蹲在舵牙邊，挾住了舵梗，一隻手，却搭在櫓尾上很安詳地說。</p>
<p>「恐怕今天到畏沙是要黃昏過了！」一個夥計倚在檣根邊，望着在天外飛行的乳白色的遊絲說。</p>
<p>船上開出午飯來了，船上的飯，只有極簡陋一碗鹹菜，荳腐，芽豆，和鹹魚之類，然郤還別饒風味，並且看他們這種狼吞虎　的吃法，也實在是怪有興趣。</p>
<p>「船埠主城裏有多少路，那兒可有地方打尖麽？」我吃過了飯，忽然想起起如果船到得晚了，自己還沒有一個下處。（待續）</p>

<h3>日本的廟寺建築（三）</h3>
<p>— 伊東忠太（著）張廣正（譯）</p>
<p>佛寺建築</p>
<p>日本的佛寺建築與神廟建築全然不同。神廟建築是純粹的古代日本所獨創的；佛寺建築是將中國傳來的式樣加以日本化·中國佛寺殿堂的形式，本來　是因襲中國古代極發達的宮室建築的模型而來的。在中國，向無稱為佛寺建築的特別樣式。因此，日本佛寺建築的根源是中國的宮殿。</p>
<p>且佛敎傳入日本，已近一千四百年。日本國民因習見於中國趣味的彿寺建築形式，對之漸生深深的親切：至今且已達愛好程度，不可或離。故現在佛寺建築，殆全照舊型，誠為當然的事。但從純理論方面考察，則佛寺建築亦不能斷定其必須依據現行的中國系的形式。這比之神廟所以不能不絕對遵奉古代形式的理由，是非常不同的地方。</p>
<p>神廟是日本皇祖皇宗神靈所在的宮室，故其建築，必以太古的樣式為標準。但佛寺是佛敎的開敎祖及諸佛所在的殿堂，故其建築或倣天竺，或是據佛典創制別種靈感的獨創的殿堂寺塔，這當然不足為怪。</p>
<p>近來佛寺的性質，已次第淪為公共建築的性質。為說敎與葬儀，或為法事的演講，或為宗敎事務與公共事業及其他各種目的所使用。為了適應這點，其建築亦當然陷入變遷的命運。總之，佛寺建築是不能斷定其將永久保持古代的式樣。最近新式樣的佛寺，隨處皆有建築。對此，吾人亦用不到深怪的，</p>
<h3>從建築藝術說到希臘的神廟（六）</h3>
<p>— 孫宗文</p>
<p>——世界建築史蹟上最光榮的一頁——</p>
<p>希臘人除貢獻他們的柱頭藝術於世界外，並且他們對於柱子Column　的設計，極有研究；在後世的建築設計上，尤多供獻。故我們亦値得討論之，其設計之特點有下列數點</p>
<p>一、柱及樑之設計，絕對的中心實性。</p>
<p>二、各柱之排列，係整個的，合併的，非零零碎碎毫無秩序的。</p>
<p>三、選擇材料有特別的長處；因他們能知道各種材料的性質及其他之經騐，故建築物能增加其耐久性。</p>
<p>四、當時又因研究地心吸力之緣故，故建築物之大小卽有一定之規定，尤其是樑及柱之設計，故無折斷及其他之危險。此一點足可增加建築物之安全性，而亦為當時最大供獻之一了。</p>
<p>五、樑及柱之設計，應用視覺矯正Opical　CorrectionS的法則，今述之於下：</p>
<p>因為我人每視一極長之一直綫，其綫的兩端，每覺向上方灣曲的。而視略作弧形之橫綫，則反沉其十分的眞直；因之希臘人基於此理由，每當設計一橫樑時，不劃直綫而略作弧形之直綫。同樣，又因我人每視一直綫時每成灣形，故希臘人每作直柱時，同樣劃成縱的弧形綫；故柱子卽向左右二傍擴大開來。這二點不可謂非希臘人對於建築設計學上之一大供獻。由此可知，希臘人之優越天才，可謂盡量發揮毫無遺憾了。</p>
<p>希臘人設計神廟建築的四週柱子，亦因依了以上所說的原理，所謂視覺矯正的原理，故正面最左及最右二個柱子，其直徑略為大些，並且其對於傍邊一個及後面一個柱子其距離略為短些；因之，人眼視之，就不覺其單調了；因為柱子的後面，並非是墻而是天空；如柱之直徑不大些，則人眼視之，就要感其太單調了呢！同樣，由此原理凡建築物上寫有文字的其上部頂上為最大，向下則漸次縮小之；其理由因為人立在前面，頭向上看，每覺其頂上之字較之底下的為小。希臘人為矯正此視覺上錯誤起見，就研究出頂上的字該比底下的為大也。</p>
<h3>建築史話（三）</h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>在中世紀，建築藝術在歐洲大多數國家發展着，各國各有它自己的特點。在英國，我們可以粗略地把「哥德式」時期分為：</p>
<p>早期英國式——十三世紀。</p>
<p>裝飾式——十四世紀。</p>
<p>垂直式——十五世紀。</p>
<p>到了十六世紀，「哥德式」逐漸衰沈，代之而興的是被稱為「都竇」（Tudor）的建築式。「都竇式」含有古羅馬建築的風味，從而產的文藝復興初期的建築。</p>
<p>在十五世紀發生於意大利的偉大的文藝復興，在許多結果之中產生一個結果，就是：意大利建築師考細考究古代羅馬的建築物，從而設計出許多新鮮而且美麗的古式的新花樣來。英國，因為距離很遠，在意大利及其近鄰已廢止「哥德式」，以後，仍然採用老法的建築式，不受新花樣的影響。固然，文藝復興的狂潮終於捲到英國來的，但這不是直接夾來的，却是經過法蘭西及荷蘭而來的，所以，早期的英國文藝復與期建築物，大抵是一種古怪的混合物，一半屬「哥德式」或「都竇式」，一半屬意大利造，又帶點荷蘭，或法國，或德國的變調。</p>
<p>式樣的改變，大抵最初發現在關於裝飾的小節目上面；這些新的設計，先經過在宅飾，金屬工作，彩飾，繪畫，及如音樂台和墳墓之類的物事上面的試騐，然後纔為實際的建築物所採用。改變是緩慢而且不整齊的。有時到達僻地需要很長久的時期，有遠至五十年之久的，</p>
<p>當伊利薩伯和詹姆士一世執政的時期，所謂文藝復興初期建築式是通行於英國全境的。到了著名的建築師瓊斯（Inigo　Jones）從研究意大利建集回到理一世的宮廷中以後，英國建築就開傾向於一種比較不混雜的新式樣，格外近似羅馬人和他們的練達的後人的作品。瓊斯固然作成許多圖案和設計，但因受內戰的阻礙，實際造成的建築物並不很多。他的最著名的作品—「白宮」中的讌會廳—不過是他打算替查理一世建式的大宮殿中的一小部分而已。</p>
<p>英國第二個著名的建築師是冷爵士（Sir　Chistopher　Wren）。他從未到過意大利，但當他到巴黎去參觀路易十六世新造的宮殿的時候，他碰到許多意大利和法蘭西建築師。</p>
<p>冷爵士帶回來的固然是意大利和法蘭西的建築計劃，但在這些計劃中都包含着他自己的各式各樣的創造計劃。他委實是被稱為「英國古典式」（Anglo—Classic　Style）建築的創造者。「大火」後的倫敦房屋重建二給他一個顯示身手的機會，「聖保羅」及其他許多地方敎堂現在還存在着，正是他的才技的標記。他又建造罕浦登法庭，格林威克醫院，乞爾西醫院，及許多美麗的私人住宅，有在城鎭的，也有在鄕村的。實在，在英國建築史上，冷爵士的功績勝於其他任何建築師，無論在前或在後；而且，假如在「大火」以後倫敦的房屋完全依照他的計劃重建，那就英國首都的面貌的富麗眞可以打倒全世界了。</p>
<p>冷爵士以後，直貫十八世紀，英國產生許多良好的建築師各人有各人自己的略微特巽的計劃，但都不脫由冷爵士首先造成英國化的偉大的古典式。</p>
<p>醫到了十九世紀初葉，關於古希臘古羅馬廢地的新的發見，新的鑑定，和新的潰繪，使人們的思想回到古典式建築的眞實的起源，結果就是「古典復活」（Classical　Revleal）從此產出的建築物—例如利物的浦聖喬治宮（StGeotoesHallid—是足够高貴壯麗的，但不完全適合英國人的團趣。</p>

<h3>The Patient's Health Cannot Endure the Burden of Official Duties: President Wang's Resolve to Resign Remains Firm. Ye Chu-cang Left Qingdao Yesterday to Report Back; He Should Arrive in Beijing Today to Report on the Situation. Chen Gongbo and Gu Mengyu Submitted Resignations to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Chu-cang sent a telegram to Beijing on the 12th, reporting on his meeting with Wang. It is heard that Wang's resolve to resign is quite firm. The Central Government will wait for Ye to return to Beijing and present a report at the Standing Committee meeting, after which it may send another representative to Qingdao. (Special Dispatch from the 11th).</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Ye Chu-cang took the Jiaoji Railway train at 7 AM on the 12th to Jinan and returned to Beijing. Ye told reporters that he had met with Wang several times and conveyed the Central Government's sincere intention to retain him. As to whether Wang's resolve to resign can be dispelled, it is not yet known. He noted that his illness has gradually improved and his spirit is excellent. There is no news whether Tang Youren will come to Qingdao. The city of Qingdao is well-constructed, and the impression from the visit is excellent. Another dispatch says that Wang's resolve to resign is extremely firm. In the afternoon of the 12th, he visited Xiao Qingdao Mountain. (Special Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi returned to Beijing on the morning of the 12th. According to him, President Wang's resolve to resign is extremely firm because he suffers from as many as six kinds of diseases: 1. Diabetes; 2. Liver fluke disease; 3. Cholecystitis; 4. Gallstones; 5. Poor gastrointestinal digestion; 6. Weak heart, sometimes stopping three or four, or even five or six times per minute. If he does not undergo fundamental treatment, there is always a risk of recurrence. Moreover, Wang's responsibilities are extremely heavy, and his sense of responsibility is also strong. If he continues to work day and night after returning to Beijing, his old illnesses will inevitably recur. Therefore, for the sake of the country, Wang believes that it is best to get rid of his duties in the Executive Yuan and various ministries at this time so that he can concentrate on treatment. After he recovers, it will be better for him to serve the Central Government again. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Ye Chu-cang arrived in Jinan today from Qingdao and met with Han. According to him, he was ordered to retain Wang, and the result was satisfactory. He returned to Beijing in the evening. Han went to the station to see him off. (Special Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Chu-cang arrived in Jinan from Qingdao on the 12th and is scheduled to return to Beijing from Jinan on the morning of the 13th, arriving at 7 PM in the evening. (Special Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th. According to him, Wang's condition is indeed better than before, but he cannot overexert himself. Therefore, he has submitted a request to the Central Government to resign in order to recuperate. The Central Government sent Ye and Cai, two committee members, to Qingdao to persuade him to stay. It is not yet known whether Wang can dispel his intention to resign, as no telegram has been received from Qingdao. It is generally expected that Wang will return to Beijing to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Political news. After learning of Wang's telegram resigning, Kong sent a long telegram to Wang to persuade him to stay, asking him to continue his leadership and not to retire hastily. Wang has replied by telegram, explaining his suffering from illness and inability to cope with the burden of official duties, and his necessity to resign. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Ye Chu-cang and Cai Yuanpei went to Qingdao to comfort Wang, it is still unknown whether President Wang can dispel his intention to resign. However, in addition to his duties in the Executive Yuan and various ministries, Wang is also a Standing Committee member of the Central Executive Committee and a Standing Committee member of the Central Political Council. It is very important whether he can come to Beijing to attend the Sixth Plenary Session on the 19th of next month. The Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, who returned to Beijing on the morning of the 12th. According to him, President Wang has not resigned from the Central Executive Committee or the Central Political Council, because Central Committee members are elected by the Party Congress and cannot be dismissed. If Wang's health is fully recovered by the time of the Sixth Plenary Session, he will be able to return to Beijing to attend. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, has submitted his resignation to the Executive Yuan, citing the heavy burden of political affairs as beyond his ability to handle. The letter of resignation has been delivered to the Executive Yuan. (Special Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo and Gu Mengyu both submitted their resignations to the Executive Yuan on the 12th, and both ministries are preparing for handover. The reasons for Chen and Gu's resignations have not been announced, and they are not stated in the letters of resignation either. However, it is widely believed that they are expressing their willingness to advance and retreat together with the President. According to reliable sources, Chen and Gu's resignations will be reported at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 13th, and they will be persuaded to stay. Chen will fly to Qingdao to see Wang within a few days. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan believe that the Executive Yuan is a responsible cabinet system. President Wang has submitted his resignation to the Central Government, and it is heard that the two ministers of Industry and Railways intend to advance and retreat together with the President. It is heard that the Executive Yuan will submit this for discussion at 10 AM on the morning of the 13th. (Telegram from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Ye Chu-cang went to Qingdao, no telegram has been sent to Beijing to report. Therefore, it is not yet possible to speculate whether President Wang's intention to resign can be dispelled. Ye left Qingdao southward on the morning of the 12th and is expected to arrive in Beijing on the 13th. It is heard that Ye will report on the progress of this trip at the Central Political Council on the 14th and the Central Standing Committee on the 15th, and Wang's resignation will be discussed. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Ye Chu-cang took the Jiaoji Railway back to Beijing at 7 AM on the morning of the 12th. According to him, Director Wang's condition is improving day by day. He did not express any opinion on Wang's resignation. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) President Wang, accompanied by his family, went to Xiao Qingdao for sightseeing in the afternoon of the 12th, and is scheduled to take the Zhenhai warship to Laoshan on the morning of the 13th. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Arrives in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Huang Shaoxiong arrived in the province by special train at noon on the 12th, and called on Chen Jitang and other dignitaries. Huang said that he would stay in the province for one day, and leave for Yong on the morning of the 13th to visit Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, and then return to his hometown before returning north. (Special Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Huang Shaoxiong and Zhong Shuren arrived in the province at noon on the 12th. Zeng Qiang, Zhang Renmin, Gan Jiehou, and others were among those who welcomed them at the station. Huang rested briefly at Li Zongren's private residence in Dongshan, and then went to the headquarters to meet with Yuan Jitang. Huang is scheduled to go to Guilin on the 13th, return to his hometown of Rong County, and then transfer to Yong to meet Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Huang Shaoxiong arrived here today and discussed issues with local leaders. Huang told a Reuters reporter that he had no important mission here, as he came from Zhejiang Province, not Nanjing. But he admitted to exchanging views with Southwest leaders to find a basis for resolving all issues. When asked about Wang Jingwei's resignation and Hu Hanmin's return to the country to preside over politics, Huang did not want to express his opinion, but said that he had not heard of Hu's return when he came south. Huang will go to Guilin in a few days. (Reuters Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Torrent Rushes Straight Down to Northern Jiangsu, the Turbulent Water Flowing Downward Breaches the Jiangsu Dike, the Wei River and Canal Waters Rise Together, the Situation Becomes Tense Again, Yellow Water Has Entered Juye City, the Dongzhuang Gate Embankment Has Collapsed</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Special Commissioner's Office has now received a report that the Yellow River water in western Shandong is rising sharply. The breach near Dongzhuang has destroyed the Jiangsu Dike. The torrent is rushing straight down to northern Jiangsu from western Shandong, and the situation is critical. A telegram from Pei County states that the waters of Longgu Set and Xia Zhen are rising sharply. A telegram from Pi County states that the waters of the Central Canal have risen three feet, and the waters of the Bulao River have risen one foot. (Special Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Li Yizhi recently telegraphed the Economic Commission, stating that he inspected the Lanjiaba Dam on the 9th and the Hukou Shuangzha on the 10th, and traveled south along the canal to Taizhuang by boat. He returned to Xuzhou at the Canal Bridge on the 11th, and went to Jining on the 11th, tracing back to Nanwang. He inspected the Weishan Lake by boat, and the water is rising continuously, and overflowing is imminent. He requested that the Jiangsu Provincial Government quickly build the southern dike of the Bulao River to reduce the flooded area, and remove the dams on the river to smooth the flow of water. (Central News Agency</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shanshuilou has risen another two inches, Yangguantun is slightly stable, Longgu Set has risen one inch, and Xia Zhen has risen one inch. All the banks along the lake are continuing to rise. The water is flowing southeast and will flow into the Grand Canal from the Jing River and the Bulao River. It is found that the outlet of Weishan Lake, north of the Linjiaba Dam, is called the Yan River, south of the Linjiaba Dam, it is called the Jing River, and the eastern section is called the Bulao River, a total of one river with three names, ending in the Canal. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to a report from western Shandong on the 12th from the Xuzhou Special Commissioner's Office, the water of the upper reaches of the Yellow River is falling rapidly. On the morning of the 11th, the main stream breached the Jiangsu Dike, about thirty zhang wide, and the momentum was quite turbulent, causing the flow at the breach of Chongzhuang and Linpu to increase, flooding several counties. The water head is rolling in from the southeast, and the situation in Weishan Lake is critical. In addition to telegraphing the provincial government, Commissioner Shao also urgently telegraphed the relevant counties of Tong, Pei, Feng, Pi, and Sui to take precautions as soon as possible.

<p>(Qingjiangpu) Mountain torrents broke out in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. In recent days, the Yellow River water has continued to rise. The water level of Weishan Lake has risen another 32 centimeters, and the stored water is 33.945 meters. According to a telegram from Pei County, the Yellow River flow entered the Central Canal directly on the evening of the 11th, and the situation is extremely critical. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Water Commission and Chief Engineer of the Huai River Guidance Commission, and Wang Jingxian, technical officer of the Guidance Commission, and Yu Shufang, technical officer of the Construction Department, inspected the various sections of the Li Canal on the morning of the 11th and arrived in Pu. Then, at 8:00 AM, they inspected the water level of the Liutang River in Huaiyin, Lian, Shu, and Dongguan counties along the sea with Ge Hanlou, Chief Engineer of the Huai River Guidance into the Sea Engineering Office. It is said that he will transfer from the sea to Xu on the 12th, and then go to Hanzhuang to inspect the water level of the Weishan Lake outlet and the Canal outlet, and then enter Shandong to inspect the situation of the Dongping, Zhaoyang, and Nanyang Lakes to seek the overall rescue and relief measures. (Special Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Kai, Chief Engineer of the Huai River Guidance Association, said that the Weihu Lake water level is increasing very quickly, reaching 33.06 meters. If it rises another 1.4 meters, a water disaster in northern Jiangsu will be difficult to avoid. Fortunately, the water level of Hongze Lake is relatively low, which is a great fortune. As for the method of dismantling the Yangzhuang dam and diverting water from the Huai River into the sea, and the waterway exiting from the Taozikou into the sea, it will never be used unless absolutely necessary. I will personally inspect the Central Canal and the Li Canal in a few days. If there is no flood intrusion into the Hai waterway, it will still be excavated. Whether the flood in northern Jiangsu can be avoided will be clear in September. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Li Yizhi went north to Jining at noon on the 12th, and transferred to Nanyang Lake and the Dongzhuang breach to inspect. Li said that after several days of inspection, the Weihu Lake water level continued to rise, which should be the Yellow River converging. Overflowing is expected within ten days. A large amount of water flows down from the Yan Jing and Bulao Rivers of Linjiaba, and a stream of water from the east bank of the dam enters the canal. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The southern section of the Dongzhuang gate's civilian-built embankment is still collapsing under the torrent. We are currently reinforcing it with bundles of branches and brushwood.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Sir Otto Niemeyer's Visit to China</h3>
<p>— Line</p>
<p>Sir Otto Niemeyer, the British government's chief economic advisor, set out for China on the tenth of this month, accompanied by Mr. Patchett of the British Treasury and Mr. Rogers, an expert from the Bank of England. He will pass through Tokyo, where he will stay for several days to discuss Far Eastern economic issues with Japanese government officials. As a result, various rumors have arisen. Some say that Niemeyer's visit is intended to reform China's currency system, bringing our country into the sterling area. Others say that Britain will propose to Japan a new alliance similar to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of the past. Even if the British side has such intentions, it seems not easy to realize in the current situation. However, Niemeyer's visit carrying a plan for economic assistance to China, is what he has formally expressed and is also known to all of us.</p>
<p>There is no other way to assist China's economy today than investment. The purpose of the investment, let us put it aside for the moment. As for its form, it can only be in two ways: one is individual investment, and the other is joint investment. In order to consolidate its economic position in the Far East, Britain has long had the intention of investing in China alone. It is only because of numerous obstacles that it has not been agreed upon. A foreign dispatch盛傳盛傳盛傳盛傳盛傳盛傳盛傳盛傳a few months ago that London had another proposal for joint investment in China by Britain, the United States, France, and Japan. Niemeyer's visit to Japan is probably mainly for this mission.</p>
<p>It is still difficult to know whether Japan is willing to leave room for consultation on joint investment recently. However, not long ago, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally declared its opposition to this proposal. Judging from Japan's various measures toward China recently, it is clear that Japan is very determined to exclude the influence of foreign powers in the Far East. Japan's plans for individual investment in China are already in active progress. The Northeast is, of course, undeniable. After the North China issue came to an end, the so-called Xingfaxiang Bank and Xingzhong Company and other companies are being organized successively. The investigation and construction of railways and cotton fields are also prepared to be carried out on a large scale. Tatsuiro Funatsu, chairman of the Japan Textile Industry Association in China, also said in an interview that in ten years, Beijing and Tianjin will become the center of the Eastern textile industry. It is truly to be called looking down on everything.</p>
<p>We deeply know by comprehensively viewing today's situation that Britain advocates joint investment, while Japan advocates individual investment. Britain wants to provide general assistance to China, while Japan wants to start with the development of North China and proceed gradually. British investment advocates taking the procedure of negotiating with our government, while Japanese investment advocates taking the investment form of joint ventures between Chinese and Japanese private enterprises. With such conflicting opinions, if Niemeyer's visit to Japan really involves persuading Japan to join the consortium, can he achieve any success?</p>
<p>Niemeyer has already come to China. Whether this mission can be completed depends on the results of his visit to Japan. It can be clarified. Today, our country, internally, has its various industries in decline, rural areas bankrupt, and natural and man-made disasters succeeding each other. Externally, it is suffering from the double blow of Japan's continental policy and the US silver purchase policy. In terms of the current political and economic situation, it is no different from Germany after the war. Its urgent need for economic assistance from other countries is undeniable. If Niemeyer's visit can indeed promote the realization of investment in China, then whether it is individual or joint action, our country should carefully consider whether the investment conditions are limited to economic and technical plans without infringing on our sacred national sovereignty. On the other hand, whether the nature of the investment is based on China's overall financial and economic situation and has no meaning of disguised partition. This is a prerequisite for acceptance or not, and the whole country should pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3>Generalissimo Chiang's Circular Telegram: Instructions for Flood Relief and Economic Construction Must Not Be Delayed</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) Generalissimo Chiang sent a telegram on the 8th to the governments of various provinces and the people of all regions, outlining the initial key points for flood relief and the promotion of national economic construction. The full text is as follows: To the chairmen of the provincial governments and, through them, to all compatriots: This year, the rivers have overflowed, causing widespread flooding, affecting provinces in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins. Crops have been submerged, villages have been destroyed, and the loss of land and property is incalculable. The plight of our compatriots in the disaster areas, adrift and suffering, is particularly tragic. The severity of the disaster in Hubei, Henan, and Shandong provinces surpasses even that of the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931). On the verge of exhaustion, they have once again suffered this calamity. How can my compatriots endure this fate? Regarding disaster relief and the resettlement of refugees, the entire nation should make active efforts. However, it is even more important to learn from past mistakes and prevent future disasters through profound awareness. Historically, floods and droughts have been called calamities, implying that they are not frequent occurrences. In the past, such widespread and severe disasters occurred only every few decades or even centuries. Now, only three years have passed since the last major disaster, and we face another one. This is definitely not due to changes in the climate or geography; it is due to the lack of human effort. If, since the establishment of the Republic of China, we had properly managed essential policies such as water conservancy and forestry, and if the local people had maintained the canals, dikes, and sluices with sincere effort, we would not be experiencing such frequent and increasingly severe disasters. Now, at this time of deep pain and loss, if we do not awaken with a sense of urgency and take immediate action to save ourselves, our nation will have no way to survive in this world. I recently telegraphed the provinces along the Yangtze River, calling for the mobilization of refugees to build dikes and dredge rivers, using labor as a form of relief. This is merely a temporary measure to address the symptoms. To eradicate disasters and remedy the future, we must have a widespread, concrete, and sustained effort throughout the country. It is my hope that the provincial governors will regard essential policies related to farmland water conservancy, such as cultivating forests, dredging rivers and lakes, constructing and protecting dikes and dams, and assisting in the construction of national water conservancy projects, as the most urgent priorities of their administration. Furthermore, the people in all regions should, without being urged, regularly repair and maintain the ditches, rivers, dikes, and dams in their respective villages, as these are all beneficial for water storage, drainage, and irrigation. We should also actively plant trees to regulate water and drought and improve the soil. Other matters related to disaster prevention and preparedness should also be diligently pursued. Only by planning ahead can we avoid unforeseen major disasters. Also, only through consistent efforts across all regions can we easily accomplish our goals. Take this flood as an example: if the waterways and dikes in the interior of each province were intact and well-maintained, even if disasters occurred, their severity would certainly be reduced. For instance, Jiangsu Province was fortunate to avoid flooding this year despite being inundated by the Yangtze, Huai, and other major rivers. This is undoubtedly due to the effective efforts of the provincial government and the people in recent years in water conservancy. This shows that human effort can overcome nature and eliminate disasters. Self-reliance is essential. This is not merely a matter of common interest; it is a matter of life and death. This is what the officials, merchants, and people of all provinces in our country should earnestly strive for. The severity of our country's economic crisis has already reached its limit. In the first half of this year, the trade deficit reached over 280 million. Both urban and rural areas are showing signs of decline and collapse. Adding to this the recent floods, according to the report of the Relief Commission, the number of victims in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces alone exceeds ten million, and the public and private losses are no less than 500 million. Moreover, the situation in Henan and Shandong provinces is no less severe. I deeply believe that the fundamental crisis facing China today lies in the devastation of the national economy. The people's livelihood is increasingly impoverished, and the fate of the nation is precarious. Therefore, the only urgent task today is to concentrate the thoughts and efforts of the entire nation to save this declining economy. After this flood, it is even more apparent that national economic construction is an urgent task that brooks no delay. Truly, any nation can only survive by being diligent, self-improving, and enduring hardship. The right to exist in the world depends on this. Whether a nation prospers or declines depends on its efforts to control nature and overcome its environment. There are many reasons for China's economic stagnation and exhaustion today. However, we cannot blame the past due to the long-standing nature of these problems, nor can we give up and await our fate due to the difficulties of the internal and external environment. We must recognize reality, strive for solutions, consider what is possible, and make the greatest effort. While basic construction related to national survival should be led by the central government, national economic construction aimed at solving the people's livelihood problems must rely on the concrete promotion by local governments and the united efforts of all the people in order to succeed. The essential points are eightfold: First, promote conscripted labor. This is the foundation of all national economic construction, and it is especially important for water conservancy and transportation. We must break the people's long-standing habits of laziness and selfishness, encourage the virtues of labor, service, and mutual assistance, and promote increased production. All projects that are related to local production and welfare and require a large amount of labor, such as building roads, dredging rivers, constructing dikes, repairing dams, cultivating forests, and opening up reclaimed land, should be carried out through the conscripted labor system. The government must plan ahead, first through publicity, then through guidance, and ensure thorough preparation and thoughtful consideration. The people should regard participation in voluntary labor as their national duty and enthusiastically participate. This is the first point. Second, revitalize agriculture. We must actively promote all efforts to improve farming methods, increase agricultural production, invigorate agricultural finance, facilitate the smooth distribution of agricultural products, reduce the burden on farmers, and promote rural cooperation, with the initial goal of achieving self-sufficiency in food. On the one hand, we should strive to encourage land reclamation and animal husbandry, investigate abandoned land, mountains, forests, and plains, determine what is suitable for each area, urge land reclamation, transform barren land into arable land, cultivate forests to increase timber production, or engage in animal husbandry to increase the number of cattle and horses. For projects that are suitable for the use of collective labor, we should organize large-scale immigration and land reclamation or organize military-agricultural settlements, with the goal of leaving no land uncultivated. This is the third point. Fourth, regulate consumption. We should collect statistics on the types and quantities of consumer goods in various regions, especially in rural areas, and work with local professional organizations and cooperatives to strive for a balance between supply and demand. For goods that must be consumed, we should try to produce them as much as possible. For goods that cannot be produced, we should try to conserve their consumption as much as possible, in order to reduce the outflow of funds from the inland rural areas. Furthermore, we should improve the people's livelihoods to promote reasonable consumption. This is the fourth point. Fifth, revitalize industry. While various regions may be limited by their financial and material resources and unable to undertake large-scale industrial construction projects, the government, people, technicians, and entrepreneurs should work together to maintain and improve existing industries and handicrafts. At the same time, we must also promote simple industries that produce goods needed in rural areas, as well as industries that process agricultural products. This is the fifth point. Sixth, develop mineral resources. We should investigate the amount of mineral resources accumulated in various regions and the actual conditions of their extraction, eliminate superstition and ignorance among the people, remove the restrictions and destruction suffered by mine operators, guide and improve primitive and unsuitable mining methods, actively encourage investment in mineral resources, and support the independent operation and development of mine merchants, in order to open up natural resources and accommodate a large amount of labor. This is the sixth point. Seventh, facilitate the flow of goods. On the one hand, we should strive to develop road transportation between counties and provinces, improve water and land transportation, and remove transportation difficulties to facilitate the flow of goods. On the other hand, we should establish packaging and marketing organizations for various important agricultural products. This is the seventh point. Eighth, adjust finance. We should encourage savings among the people, facilitate the flow of funds, establish a complete rural lending system, promote credit cooperation to curb the exploitation of high interest rates, and guide the people to support the national policy on currency exchange. This is the eighth point. The above eight points are all practical measures that are essential for saving the current economic construction. The main point is to make the best use of human resources and land resources, and to bring all the forces of agriculture, industry, commerce, and education in various regions into close relationship with natural resources and economic undertakings. Therefore, the responsibility for presiding over and promoting this lies with the government. However, in order to achieve concrete and effective results, it is even more important that the local people have a general awareness, and that intellectuals take on the responsibility of promoting, guiding, and assisting in the organization. From this perspective, the investigation, statistics, collection of materials, research, and guidance on implementation methods in various regions are indispensable. Therefore, at the beginning of the process, we must, on the one hand, gather local experts to take on the task of specialized technical research and guidance, and on the other hand, train a large number of mid-level service personnel to take on the responsibility of investigation and general management and guidance. These so-called mid-level service personnel include civil servants from various agencies and public offices, village chiefs, and officers at all levels in the military. They can be trained in various ways according to their nature, without necessarily recruiting them separately. In order to achieve the goal of cooperation, it is also necessary for educational institutions, schools, groups, industries, national organizations, and cooperatives in various regions to enthusiastically support the effort. In short, government offices must abandon the past practice of perfunctory work that is unrealistic and only deals with superficialities. The people must deeply realize that this undertaking is the key to saving lives and turning the tide, and do their best to achieve the same goal. In the future, those who are responsible for construction administration in various provinces must earnestly focus on developing the national economy when formulating policy guidelines and regard this as the sole focus. If the government and the people respond as one, and work hard together with perseverance, I believe that there is hope for saving the endangered national economy, and that the material foundation for national revival will be laid. At this time of severe disaster, the fear of economic collapse is even greater. It is imperative to take timely remedial measures without delay. I sincerely hope that the officials of various provinces and the compatriots throughout the country will accept my humble words and put them into practice. Chiang Chung-cheng.

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army announced that Nagata Tetsuzan, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, was stabbed with a military sword this morning in his office by a certain lieutenant colonel from a certain unit, and his life is in critical condition. The perpetrator was immediately arrested by the military police. It is reported that Major General Nagata is a central figure in the Control Faction under Army Minister Hayashi. Nan, Abe, Honjo, Watanabe, and other military advisors are on its outer perimeter. (Thirteenth, Japanese United News dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an announcement by the Ministry of the Army, Nagata Tetsuzan, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Lieutenant General, Fourth Rank, First Class Order of Merit, passed away at 4:00 PM on the 12th. (Twelfth, Japanese United News dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi feels a great sense of responsibility due to the assassination of Military Affairs Bureau Director Nagata and the fact that the perpetrator is an active-duty officer. He intends to submit his resignation in the coming days. (Twelfth, Japanese United News dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Military Affairs Bureau Director Nagata was stabbed by a certain lieutenant colonel in his office this morning and died of his injuries in the afternoon. The perpetrator was arrested, but his name has not been announced. The motive for the assassination is currently very unclear. Enquiries at the Ministry of the Army have all been met with silence. However, it is generally believed that the main reason is that Nagata has been vigorously supporting the Ministry of the Army's policy of controlling the Japanese military, especially the Kwantung Army, and curbing the activities of the so-called young officers' faction. As a result, nearly a thousand Japanese military officers have been dismissed. The perpetrator is likely an opponent of this policy. (Twelfth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Military Affairs Bureau Director Nagata went to his family's summer retreat in Kujukuri yesterday and only returned to Tokyo this morning. He went to the Director's office on the second floor of the Ministry of the Army to work. At that time, a certain active-duty lieutenant colonel, wearing a military uniform, said that he had come to pay his respects due to his transfer. Without waiting for an announcement, he barged into the Director's office and stabbed Director Nagata directly with a military sword. The lieutenant colonel's wrist seemed to be quite strong, causing Director Nagata to faint immediately, covered in blood. The lieutenant colonel remained calm and did not flee. He was arrested by a staff member of the Military Affairs Section in the adjacent room and then detained by the military police. (Twelfth, Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the assassination of Military Affairs Bureau Director Nagata, the Ministry of the Army immediately closed the front and rear doors at 10:00 AM. More than a dozen military police officers were dispatched from the Akasaka and Kojimachi military police stations to be on high alert. Everyone entering and leaving the Ministry of the Army was questioned. After the various departments in the ministry received the news that Director Nagata had been seriously injured, the top leadership immediately held a secret meeting in the Military Affairs Bureau. Army Minister Hayashi rushed to the Ministry of the Army from his official residence after hearing the news. The situation seemed very tense, reminiscent of the situation at the time of the May 15th Incident. However, due to the rapid handling of the aftermath, no one knows the truth of the incident, and everyone is in a state of confusion. (Twelfth, Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The lieutenant colonel who assassinated Major General Nagata is currently being held in the Tokyo Military Police Station and is being interrogated. As soon as the investigation is completed, he will be brought to the First Division to convene a military court to handle the case. (Twelfth, Japanese United News dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Ministry Announces Details of Nagata's Assassination: Perpetrator Broke into Director's Office and Stabbed Director in the Chest with a Military Sword</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an announcement by the Ministry of the Army, Military Affairs Bureau Director Major General Nagata went to the Ministry of the Army to work as usual at 8:00 AM on the 12th. While he was handling bureau affairs in his office, at around 9:00 AM, Colonel Niimi Hideo, commander of the Tokyo Military Police, visited the director. While he was listening to the military police commander's report on the public figures under his jurisdiction, at 9:40 AM, a certain lieutenant colonel suddenly broke into the office and stabbed the director in the right chest with a military sword, causing serious injuries. At that time, Military Police Commander Colonel Niimi used his body to protect the director and tried to stop the crime. As a result, his upper arm was injured. He has now been sent to the Tokyo First Garrison Hospital for treatment. It is said that the colonel's upper arm bone was injured and it will take three weeks to fully recover. (Twelfth, Japanese United News dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo First Garrison Hospital dispatched an ambulance to the Ministry of the Army at around 1:00 PM and sent Director Nagata back to his home, accompanied by Military Affairs Section Chief Hashimoto and Major Arisue. Nagata's wife and three children, who heard the urgent news, rushed back to Tokyo from their summer retreat in Kurihama. (Twelfth, Japanese United News dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The funeral of the late Military Affairs Bureau Director Nagata has been decided to be held on the 15th at the Aoyama Cemetery with a Buddhist ceremony. It has been decided that Army Vice Minister Hashimoto will serve as the chairman of the funeral committee, and Chief of the Second Department of the General Staff Headquarters, Okamura, will serve as the vice-chairman.

<p>(Tokyo) Major General Nagata Tetsuzan was from Nagano Prefecture. In Meiji 37 (1904), he graduated from the Army Academy with honors and became a second lieutenant in the army. In Meiji 44 (1911), he graduated from the Army War College. In Taisho 2 (1913), he was promoted to captain and studied military affairs in Germany. Afterwards, he served as a military attache in Denmark and Sweden. In Taisho 11 (1922), he served as a staff officer in the Education General Directorate of the General Staff Headquarters and also concurrently served as an instructor at the Army War College. In Showa 7 (1932), he served as the commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade. In Showa 9 (1934), he served as the director of the Military Affairs Bureau and concurrently as the secretary-general of the Military Council. Up until today, Nagata has been the center of the Army's Control Faction. When Army Minister Hayashi dismissed Education General Director Mazaki in August and General Qin, etc., Nagata was active behind the scenes, assisting the Army Minister and controlling the Army's direction. (Twelfth, Japanese United News dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Major General Nagata Tetsuzan, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, who was stabbed this morning in the Director's office of the Military Affairs Bureau in the Ministry of the Army, graduated at the top of his class from the 16th graduating class of the Army Academy. He was a man of strong character, clear mind, and great talent. Therefore, the major general's first major undertaking was the National General Mobilization Plan. The main points of the general mobilization plan currently being implemented by the Resources Bureau and the Army and Navy were actually drafted by the major general. Furthermore, the late major general held the longest tenure at the Ministry of the Army. No one else handled as many major incidents as the major general. Since taking office as Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, he immediately began reforming the structure in Manchuria and addressing various difficult issues such as the Emperor Organ Theory, and ultimately succeeded. Since Army Minister Hayashi took office, the major general assisted with military administration. His personality was also quite similar to that of Army Minister Hayashi, so he was deeply trusted by Army Minister Hayashi. However, he was very weak. If he had been physically strong, he would have certainly become the Minister of the Army and taken overall control of military administration in a few years. (Twelfth, Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Upon hearing the news that Military Affairs Bureau Director Nagata was in critical condition, the Emperor promoted the director to the rank of lieutenant general on the afternoon of the 12th and also conferred upon him the Fourth Rank. This has already been announced. (Twelfth, Japanese United News dispatch)</p>

<h3>New President of the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) - Matsuoka to Assume Post Regularly - Currently Considering Investment Issues with Authorities</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) President Matsuoka of Mantetsu is scheduled to discuss official business with Army Minister Hayashi on the 13th, and after formally taking over from former President Hayashi, who will return to Tokyo on the 15th, he is scheduled to depart from Tokyo on the 23rd to assume his post. He plans to stay overnight in Dalian and then proceed to Changchun to meet with Ambassador Minami, the resident ambassador to Manchukuo. The issues concerning Vice President Hatta and other matters will all be discussed together. (Jiji News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Jiji Shinpo reports that since the Northeast Incident, Japan's investment in the Northeast has reached 1 billion Japanese yen. This includes both increased capital for the South Manchuria Railway and military expenses. Japanese financial authorities are currently drafting plans to control future investments in the Northeast and North China, so as not to disrupt Japan's general international payments. Mantetsu President Matsuoka is currently discussing this matter with Prime Minister Okada, Finance Minister Takahashi, and Army Minister Hayashi. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tatsujiro Funatsu, director of general affairs for the Japan Cotton Spinners' Association in China, has returned after completing his survey of North China. The results indicate that if Japan wants to monopolize the North China cotton cloth market and develop Japan's textile industry in China, it should start cotton cultivation in North China, focusing on Hebei Province, and gradually develop the Japanese spinning industry in North China, centering on Beijing and Tianjin. At the same time, new factories should be established in the Beijing-Tianjin area to increase spindles in order to expand sales channels. Mr. Funatsu's proposals have been discussed with Japanese cotton textile industrialists many times and have been endorsed by them, and efforts will be actively promoted to realize them. Mr. Funatsu pointed out the reasons why Japan must develop the cotton textile industry in North China in the future, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Factories in Shanghai and Qingdao have reached saturation;</p>
<p>(2) Sales channels for products from North China have always been the top in the whole of China;</p>
<p>(3) The political situation in North China will be relatively easier for the development of the textile industry in the future;</p>
<p>(4) Chinese workers in the Beijing-Tianjin area are docile and wages are low;</p>
<p>(5) Land prices are also low, leaving ample room for expansion of factories;</p>
<p>(6) The most important water volume and water quality for textile operations are also good;</p>
<p>(7) In a decade or two, North China can supply the best cotton raw materials;</p>
<p>(8) The general industry and transportation in the Beijing-Tianjin area are still relatively developed, and there are many possibilities for expanding sales channels to the interior. Moreover, there is little hope for cotton improvement in North China in the next five to ten years, so the construction of new factories must focus on ten to twenty years from now. In the future, Beijing and Tianjin will definitely become the center of the East Asian textile industry. (Hualian News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Dalian Hualian News Agency) According to the investigation by the South Manchuria Railway Economic Research Association, the international balance of payments for the entire "Manchukuo" (including the Kwantung Leased Territory) based on joint investigation with the puppet Ministry of Finance, is as follows: (Unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>(1933)  (1934)</p>
<p>Exports 453,520 453,469</p>
<p>Imports 567,183 652,651</p>
<p>Excess of Imports 113,663 199,182</p>
<p>Non-Trade Income</p>
<p>Regular Receipts 147,600 112,079</p>

<p>Total Trade and Non-Trade Income 931,368 934,949</p>
<p>Total Trade and Non-Trade Expenditure 916,215 835,207</p>
<p>Excess of Total Income 15,153 99,742</p>
<p>In addition, the total amount of investment in "Manchukuo" was 298 million yuan in 1933 and 334 million yuan in 1934, mainly in the form of national bonds and corporate bonds issued. The above report is the first complete survey since the "September 18th" Incident.</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to the Kwantung Army's announcement, as of July of this year, the nature and number of "bandits" throughout Manchuria are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Anti-Manchukuo and Anti-Japanese Army: 8,000 people</p>
<p>(2) Communist bandits: 7,000 people</p>
<p>(3) Korean bandits: 500 people</p>
<p>(4) Pure bandits: 12,500 people</p>
<p>Total: 28,000 people. The bandits' bases are located in the Wanda Mountain range in the eastern border area between the Soviet Union and Manchuria, including Laoye Ridge, Laosong Ridge, Mudan Ridge, and Longgang Ridge. Security has been gradually restored in areas other than the aforementioned ridges. (Jiji News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The former Soviet employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway, i.e., the North Manchuria Railway, have all returned to their country, totaling 5,639 households and 19,174 people. They have left here successively in the past four months. Only 600 households remain in North Manchuria. The North Manchuria Railway Administration has issued a notice that former Russian employees who wish to reside in Shanghai, Dalian, or other places in Manchuria will be exempted from the travel expenses for themselves, their families, and their luggage.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance Adopts Policy of Gradually Reducing Public Bonds - Regular Meetings with the Navy Ministry</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance is scheduled to hold a budget meeting in Hayama on the 20th to determine the policy for compiling the next year's budget and will begin reviewing the overall budget proposal from September. In next year's budget, national defense expenditures will inevitably increase. The Ministry of Finance intends to suppress the increase in the budget by gradually reducing public bonds. The digestive capacity of the public bond market has been declining year by year, so it is necessary to increase digestive capacity and gradually reduce public bonds in order to establish sound finances. The Ministry of Finance, considering the current state of the financial world and the general economic situation, estimates the maximum limit for public bond issuance at 700 million yuan. However, Finance Minister Takahashi believes that the rapid realization of reducing public bonds is extremely difficult, so he is determined to cooperate with financial authorities on next year's budget to strengthen finances. (Jiji News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance is scheduled to hold a joint meeting between the Ministries of the Navy and Finance at the Minister of the Navy's official residence at 1:00 PM on the 15th to exchange views on next year's national defense expenditures. The Navy Ministry believes that its requested military expenditure of 1 billion yuan is the minimum limit. (Jiji News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Showa 7 (1932), the Army has been keenly focusing on the preparation of combat materials and related improvements in military equipment. Over the past four years up to this year, expenditures in this area have increased by approximately 600 million yuan. Therefore, the continued funding for the preparation of national defense has largely been fully spent this year. However, the international environment has not only failed to ease but has become more urgent. It is obvious that even with this level of preparation, there is still a significant gap from the minimum military goals for thorough land defense. Therefore, the Army plans to actively continue the preparation of combat materials and improvement of military equipment from next year with a five-year plan totaling approximately 800 million yuan as the second phase. The outline of this plan was submitted to the Ministry of Finance at the beginning of this month. As a result, not only is the Army's budget for next year around 600 million yuan, but even until Showa 15 (1940), a minimum of 600 million yuan will continue to be allocated annually. However, Army Minister Hayashi and the Army's central department are researching whether obtaining such an Army budget will have a significant impact on industry and rural areas, as this is the greatest national policy of the Empire at present. Therefore, with this belief, they are keenly studying countermeasures. Taking advantage of Army Minister Hayashi's negotiations with Finance Minister Takahashi on next year's Army budget, Army Minister Hayashi will report the results of his research to the Finance Minister and strongly advocate for increased revenue, a major reorganization of existing expenditures, and fundamental reform of the administrative and tax systems.

<h3>Japanese Government and Public Inclined Towards Anglo-Japanese Compromise - Secure Japanese Cotton Cloth Market - Ease British Anti-Japanese Policies</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese private cotton industry conference in London in March of last year, the British government announced in May of the same year that, except for self-governing dominions and India with fiscal autonomy, all British territories would adopt import restriction systems for Japanese cotton and silk products (the restriction amount is based on the average amount from 1927 to 1930). Consequently, Egypt also abandoned the Japanese-Egyptian agreement. Recently, Britain has also instigated Palestine and its adjacent areas of Transjordan, as well as Iraq, to gradually boycott Japanese goods. The impact of this is that English-speaking countries in Central and South America may also adopt the same attitude, which is a great blow to the Japanese cotton cloth industry. Recently, the arguments of the Japanese government and public towards compromise with Britain are increasingly gaining ground. They are preparing to negotiate with Britain again on how to jointly allocate the world market and re-establish an Anglo-Japanese agreement. This move can not only alleviate the cotton industry crisis and secure the cotton cloth market but also seek the overall development of export trade. It is said that this may lead to the reopening of the Anglo-Japanese cotton industry conference. (Hualian News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Current Status of US Cotton Exports to Japan - Accounts for 48 Percent</h3>
<p>San Francisco - Ms. Milan, a researcher at the U.S. Pacific Council, published an article today stating that American farmers who grow long-staple cotton do not need to worry about losing the Japanese market. Although Japan is currently trying to cultivate cotton outside the United States, its needs still cannot help but rely on the United States. Although India, China, and Latin America all produce cotton, it is difficult to replace the position of the United States. The advantages of American cotton cannot be achieved urgently by new cotton varieties. Japanese cotton mills are accustomed to using American cotton and cannot use cotton from other producing areas for experimentation. Moreover, it is doubtful whether the new cotton growers, who need cotton urgently, can supply Japan with surplus cotton. Therefore, even if Japan is about to abandon American cotton, it must go through a very long period. According to statistics, in 1934, American cotton imported into Japan accounted for 55% of the total, and also accounted for 48% of Japan's total cotton imports. Indian cotton still ranked second. Japan's cotton purchases from countries other than the United States and India accounted for only 10% of the total, which is less than 1% more than in the previous four years. From 1931 to 1934, the total value of American cotton textile exports was US$1,062,000, while cotton exports to Japan increased by US$36,913,000 during the same period. Therefore, the increase in Japanese cotton textile exports did not have much impact on American goods. Moreover, cotton textiles accounted for only 2% of the total U.S. exports in 1934, while cotton accounted for 17%. (Kokumin News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Emperor Announces Compromise Conditions - Japan to Establish Embassy Next Spring</h3>
<p>(Paris) When a reporter from the French semi-official news agency interviewed the Abyssinian Emperor and asked whether, in order to avoid the crisis of war between Italy and Abyssinia, he would consider sacrificing part of the territory in exchange for financial assistance to promote Abyssinia's culture and economy, the Emperor replied, "First, it must be solemnly stated that the independence of Abyssinia cannot be sacrificed under any circumstances. The Abyssinian government always hopes to obtain loans to develop the country and improve culture. If Abyssinia can obtain a seaport, it will greatly contribute to this progress. If these goals can be achieved one by one, then we will not oppose ceding part of the Ogaden Province in exchange for loans and a seaport. This is a fundamental issue, but before reaching an agreement, many details remain to be resolved, and each detail must be discussed individually." (Kokumin News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) There has been no comment from those responsible regarding the Abyssinian Emperor's suggestion to cede territory in exchange for loans and a seaport. However, it seems that Italy will not accept this suggestion. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Office Minister Eden is scheduled to depart for Paris tomorrow to participate in the tripartite Anglo-French-Italian conference convened under the 1906 treaty on Abyssinia. If Eden travels by train, he will depart at 2:00 PM tomorrow; if he travels by plane, he will depart at 6:30 PM. The decision has not yet been made. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the London correspondent of Le Journal, the British government has adopted a resolute attitude towards the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. The British government is determined to demand the closure of the Suez Canal if necessary and has recently exerted pressure on the Washington government to ensure that American banks refuse to lend money to Italy. It is reported that Italy recently requested loans from Wall Street bankers to purchase a large number of American-made machines, but was rejected. "At the same time, the American International Nickel Company also refused to sell the nickel it needed to Italy on credit. This news is not false. In addition, the British government has also put pressure on France to prevent the French government from allowing its national bank and several private commercial banks to provide Italy with lending facilities. Furthermore, it is reported that the Abyssinian government has granted the rights to build a car road between the Abyssinian capital and British Egypt Sudan to a certain Swiss company. Although the company is registered in Zurich, Switzerland, it is actually purely a British interest Swiss company. The idea is simply to deceive people." Italy, according to the 1906 Anglo-French-Italian Treaty, thought it could monopolize this road right, but now that it has been obtained by another country, it will inevitably be unhappy. This car road has two purposes: (1) From a military strategic point of view, if the Italian army advances too quickly towards Lake Tana after the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian War, the supply of Abyssinian military supplies may be cut off, but after the car road is built, military supplies can be transported from Sudan to Abyssinia. (2) Platinum and gold mines have recently been discovered in Abyssinia, and the construction of the car road is to prepare to grant the mining rights to Britain. In short, after the road is completed, Britain can exercise its protective rights in western Abyssinia. By then, even if Italy rushes to Lake Tana, it may be too late. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>The Abyssinian Emperor declared in the capital today that if all efforts to seek a peaceful resolution of the dispute with Italy fail, the Abyssinian army will rise up to defend the country, and he will personally lead it until the red blood flows out. Italy, regardless of other parties' efforts to seek peace, is still sending troops and war supplies to its two territories bordering Abyssinia. The crisis of war is now becoming more and more urgent, but we still hope that the League of Nations and Britain can prevent war. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Cairo - The Italian medical ship California, which will be used to transport wounded and sick soldiers when the Italo-Abyssinian War occurs, passed through the Suez Canal today and headed to East Africa. The ship was converted from a postal ship. (Kokumin News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese legation in Abyssinia will be newly established next spring in order to enhance friendly relations between Japan and Abyssinia. It is said that the person chosen to be the first minister has been internally decided as Toshicharu Harima, the first secretary of the Italian Embassy. Furthermore, recently, in order to express special friendship towards Japan, the Abyssinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to send a secret envoy to visit Japan. Mr. Dabba Bir will lead the special envoy on a visit to Japan. (Hualian News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A special correspondent in London for Le Journal comments on Britain's attitude towards the Greek constitutional issue, saying that those close to Britain are doing their best to encourage the restoration of the Greek monarchy. Britain's attitude is not only due to the close relationship between the British royal family and the deposed Greek Emperor, but also due to the great divergence of opinion between Britain and Italy on the Abyssinian issue. Britain will not allow Italy to occupy the Red Sea and control the Greek mines that supply military raw materials. Britain will soon openly advocate for the restoration of the Greek monarchy. It is no coincidence that the government recently announced the delivery of 70 aircraft to the Greek government. (Kokumin News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Strenuously Attacks Interference in Politics by the Catholic Church - Anti-Semitic Incidents Continue to Occur</h3>
<p>German Führer Hitler gave a speech in Rosenheim today, strenuously attacking the Catholic Church's interference in politics. Hitler said, "Those who consider themselves specially blessed by Heaven, I can tell them that fifteen years ago, all I had was faith and will. Now, National Socialism is already Germany, and how could it have been achieved without God's blessing?" Hitler continued to make a prediction, saying, "In the next five hundred years, the swastika flag will never be able to be separated from the hearts of the German people." Hitler had the following warning for Germany's enemies, saying, "If they still want to fight like cornered beasts, it is not impossible, but we must annihilate them in one fell swoop at this time, so as not to waste another fourteen years to fight against them. I firmly believe that now no one in the world can attack Germany without suffering harm themselves. However, we sincerely desire peace so that we can rebuild Germany." (Kokumin News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Dortmund - Anti-Semitic incidents have been occurring one after another in various places recently. A Jew who runs an apartment here, along with his wife, daughters, and three Jewish lodgers, were all arrested by the secret police because several lodgers had shameful secret trysts with Aryan girls in this apartment. Also, a company in Hamburg Port was closed by the police authorities for "maintaining public safety" because it hired Jewish employees. In addition, the Cologne National Socialist Party's newspaper, the "West German Observer," has opened a special column to publish the names of Jewish merchants and Jews who live with Aryan women. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The authorities have recently issued an order to farmers who have joined the "German Food Corporation" to prohibit their children from joining various youth organizations of the church. Recently, the German authorities, in view of the "danger of children being influenced by the church and gradually developing a psychology of hostility towards the state," issued an order prohibiting them from joining church organizations. The intention of the ban issued this time is the same. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Intermarriage between Aryans and non-Aryans will be officially prohibited from now on. The Ministry of Justice has recently issued a departmental order stipulating that if the two parties to a marriage are not of the same race, the civil affairs chief may prohibit them from holding a wedding ceremony.

<h3>French President Strongly Urges End to Internal Strife - However, the Left Wing Strongly Advocates for Continued Struggle - And Another Case of Embezzlement by Customs Officials Occurs</h3>
<p>(Paris) French President Lebrun gave a sincere speech at the opening ceremony of the war memorial in Meaux today, earnestly urging the people to end internal strife, saying that he was tired of seeing and hearing coarse fists, angry faces, and vicious words. The people should immediately restore calm, order, and harmony. The memorial is to commemorate the soldiers on both sides who died in the European War, and its scale is unmatched in France. At the same time, the Labor Party and the Communist Party gave speeches to the masses in Paris today, strongly urging them to continue to fight against the new economic laws promulgated by the government. However, the speakers all criticized the use of violent means. No police or gendarmes were seen on the roads where the workers marched today. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A large-scale smuggling organization that caused the French government to lose 150,000,000 francs in three years has been cracked down on in Le Havre. Several customs officials have now been arrested, and one of them attempted suicide but was stopped. After sixty boxes of military supplies that had been shipped to South America suddenly disappeared and were found again, the arrested people began to be suspected. This smuggling organization apparently did not expose any flaws in the past three years. The method was that for all imported goods passing through Le Havre, one box must have a special mark. This box was checked by customs officials. The goods in it completely matched those listed on the manifest, but in fact, other boxes were loaded with untaxed goods, mostly radio parts and tobacco. However, the boxes were never inspected. The number of smugglers increased day by day, and finally, it failed because a customs official who was involved in the fraud took a leave of absence, and a new customs official ordered all the boxes to be opened for inspection. This illegal activity was exposed. When the police went to question many merchants involved in this, they were all traveling abroad. (Kokumin News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>British General Election Next Year - Baldwin's Opinion</h3>
<p>(London) It is expected that the British general election will be held in January next year. Although many supporters of the government advocate holding it this autumn, Reuters has learned that Prime Minister Baldwin has actually decided not to appeal to the whole country before the New Year. Before Baldwin left for vacation, he had a long consultation with his political advisors, all of whom opposed holding the general election this autumn. Judging from the situation, it must be postponed until January next year. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>World Shipping Competition - US to Build Two More Largest New Ships</h3>

<h3>British Flight to Cape Town</h3>
<p>(London) Famous British aviator Black has abandoned his attempt to fly from England to Cape Town and has now flown from Cairo to Kroonstad airfield, taking 12 hours and 15 minutes.

<h3>Soviet Union Pardons Large Number of Former Offenders</h3>
<p>(Moscow) When the grain tax was implemented in 1932 and 1933, some officials not only failed to prohibit the wealthy peasants from evading their obligations, but even violated their duties. Their absenteeism and dereliction of duty were obviously harmful to the interests of the state. At that time, these people were transferred for disciplinary action and sentenced to various punishments. This matter was a serious lesson for state officials, and administrative discipline was greatly enhanced as a result. The Soviet Central Executive Committee now believes that the motives of these offenders were not out of selfishness, and that most of the cases were due to their failure to understand the duties they were responsible for. Therefore, the Central Executive Committee now issues an order that these people may be exempted from punishment in the future. In addition, those who were convicted in 1933 and 1934 for privately issuing labor bonds and other currency substitutes have also been released. All records of crimes and all restrictions on their rights will be canceled for those who have been released by this order. (TASS, 12th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Silver Purchase Reaching Its End; Silver Advocates Believe Government Only Implementing Part of the Plan; Congress Adjourns, No Other Hope</h3>
<p>(Washington) With the closing date of Congress approaching, silver advocate members have completely given up hope of making silver the standard of the currency system. Today, according to the Associated Press, they believe that the government's silver purchase program is only implementing a portion of the original intention of the Silver Purchase Act. Representative Deyki stated that, in his opinion, the silver purchase plan is indeed a factor in raising wholesale prices, but its power to promote the export of agricultural products is very limited, because the Treasury Department's silver purchase has not fully met the wishes of Congress. Mr. Bao also stated that he agreed with Mr. Thomas that if the United States purchased enough silver to reach a ratio of three parts gold to one part silver, it would have to pay a price of one dollar per ounce. Deyki does not hope for the realization of a future international conference to discuss silver, but he believes that countries around the world are gradually realizing the value of silver as a medium of international exchange, because all the world's cash has been concentrated in a few countries, so there is no other "hard currency" besides silver. Currently, members of Congress have received many letters regarding silver, indicating an increase in public interest in silver. Most of these letters come from the western agricultural and mining areas, but most members do not believe that the silver issue can become a point of contention in next year's general election. Deyki also expressed opposition today to McKallen's proposal to restore the New York silver market, because this proposal would allow a few speculators to make huge profits. However, after the Treasury Department purchases enough silver, he would also support restoring the New York market. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Kuling: Record of Recovering the Leased Territory. Provincial Government Sends Officials for Successful Negotiation. Official Signing and Return of Sovereignty.</h3>
<p>Kuling Correspondence: After the recovery of police power in January of the 16th year of the Republic of China in the foreign leased territory of Kuling, Lushan, the internal affairs, finance, public works, sanitation and other administrations of the area were still controlled by the board of directors formed by foreigners and executed by the Kuling Public Affairs Office. After several negotiations, on the 8th of this month, the British Consul Morse officially signed with the Director of the Lushan Administration Bureau to return the administration and restore our sovereignty. The process is as follows: Lushan is the only famous scenic spot in the southeast, close to the Yangtze River, with convenient transportation. Celebrated figures and scholars of all dynasties have roamed and composed poems here, adding to its beauty. In the late Qing Dynasty, the German merchant, Schill von Rennenkampff, illicitly sold a piece of land in Kuling, the northern part of the mountain, to a Briton named Liddell. Liddell then cleared the land and built houses, causing an uproar among the local people, who, not understanding diplomatic procedures, burned down Liddell's residence. The British Minister lodged a protest, and the Qing government, fearing the power of foreigners, agreed to pay compensation and apologize. The Dehua County Office then formally leased Changchong to Liddell as a summer resort on November 16th of the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign. The area is over 4,000 feet above sea level, and the northern gap has Poyang Lake, which regulates the Yangtze River's water vapor, keeping the summer temperature around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, about 15 degrees cooler than the plains, making it ideal for summer rest. The famous scenic spots, historical sites, flying waterfalls, and flowing springs are especially suitable for regulating the body and mind. Therefore, foreigners have worked hard to develop this area, building roads, constructing foreign houses, and making it increasingly prosperous. Later, they expanded it from time to time, incorporating Caodipo, Xiachong, Houziling, Doctor's Knoll, and other places into the leased area. Covering several miles, it is full of villas and foreign buildings. At that time, the authorities turned a blind eye to this, and foreigners formed a board of directors, with twelve directors elected by residents from Britain, Germany, and the United States. Underneath was the Kuling Public Affairs Office, which carried out all administrative matters related to police, finance, public works, and public health, essentially forming a concession that only paid us 711 yuan in rent per year. Even the police bureau and land survey bureau from the Qing Dynasty to the 15th year of the Republic could not overstep it. It is reported that in the early years of the Republic of China, the land in Kuling was less than two or three jiao per square zhang. Between the 7th and 8th years, the price of land soared as many people came here for summer retreats. By the 15th year, each square zhang cost from four or five yuan to as much as twenty-five or six yuan. Foreigners made a fortune here, while our countrymen who came here for summer retreats, to set up shops, or to reside were excluded to the Zhengjie Yaowo Shiba Ling area. Even if they owned land and houses in the leased territory, they were not allowed to participate in any of the so-called administrative rights of the board of directors. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the concessions of Hankou and Jiujiang were recovered one after another, but in Kuling, only the police power was returned. The board of directors still existed in a deformed state, and the administration of the Public Affairs Office remained the same as before. According to a survey in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Public Affairs Office collected tens of thousands of yuan annually in taxes from residents, which were entirely at its disposal. Although we recovered police power, the Public Affairs Office only assisted with police salaries of 283 yuan per month and 200 yuan for the security police team. In the 19th year of the Republic, the Xun Municipal Government abolished the Lushan Administration Bureau, which became directly under the provincial government. Vigorously reforming and improving public safety, public works, sanitation, public utilities, and other aspects, foreigners could find no excuse to object. Therefore, the director of the Bureau, Jiang Zhicheng, following the instructions of his superiors, repeatedly negotiated to recover all administration and take over the Public Affairs Office, to avoid being a mere figurehead. Only this summer did some progress appear. When the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Xiong Shihui, arrived on the mountain this month, he immediately telegraphed Commissioner Xiao of the Provincial Government to come and negotiate with the British Consul. As a result, the various leased territories in Kuling were recovered. At 11 a.m. on the 8th, the Director of the Lushan Administration Bureau, Jiang Zhicheng, and the British Consul, Morse, officially signed the agreement. Thus, this leased territory, from November 16th of the 21st year of the Guangxu reign to the present day, thirty-nine years later, has been completely resolved. (August 9th)</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Holding Province-Wide Business Registration</h3>
<p>In order to control and manage the businesses of the entire province, to adapt supply and demand, and to eliminate speculation and fraud, the Zhejiang Provincial Business Administration Bureau plans to hold a general business registration, investigate the organizational content of each store, the exact amount of capital, etc. A plan has been drafted and submitted to the Construction Department to be presented to the Provincial Government Meeting for approval, so that it can be implemented. The principles are as follows: (1) Registration will be based on the principle of not charging fees. Even if a very small fee is charged, it will be borne by the Chamber of Commerce. (2) Emphasis will be placed on the rights and interests of registration and strict measures against non-registration, so that merchants will be happy to engage in it. (3) New stores cannot begin operations until they are registered.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Issues Important Statement: President Wang Telegraphed Request to Resign. Central Political Council to Submit for Discussion.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Kong Xiangxi, Deputy Executive Yuan President and Minister of Finance, went to the Central Bank Management Office at around 11:00 AM yesterday morning. Before departing, he met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence. According to him, he had just received a telegram from President Wang from Qingdao, expressing his continued willingness to be responsible for national affairs. However, he was concerned that although the apparent illness had gone, the root cause had not been cured. Wang would have to return to Nanjing after recovering from his illness, but hoped to relinquish his administrative duties. I deeply hope that President Wang will be responsible to the end, and Chairman Chiang shares this view. Wang holds many important positions in the central government, so we hope that he will recover soon and return to Nanjing to take responsibility. This matter will be submitted for discussion at the Central Political Council this week. Kong was scheduled to preside over the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 13th, and therefore took the night train from Shanghai to Nanjing last night.</p>

The floods of the 20th year are still a scene of devastation, and this year's floods in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi are an unprecedented catastrophe. The displaced compatriots are in dire straits and cannot bear to see. The loss of property directly affects the national economy and the people's livelihood and is even more difficult to estimate. Our party takes universal love as the revolutionary motive, and disaster relief and compassion for the people as our duty. As the ancients said, the heart of compassion is in everyone. We, as public officials under the party's rule, have always taken leading the masses and relieving their suffering as our responsibility. We must have the deepest sympathy for the general disaster-stricken people and do our best to fulfill our obligations. Our association has previously received a telegram from the central government ordering us to participate in disaster relief work, which has been forwarded to our subordinates for compliance. Now, after the 128th executive committee meeting of our association, it was resolved to launch a general mobilization for railway party members to donate to disaster relief. The detailed measures have also been drafted. In addition to forwarding them for compliance and reporting them, a copy of the measures is enclosed and sent to your bureau. Please investigate and instruct your subordinates to assist as much as possible when the time comes. This order is issued, and a copy of the measures is attached.

<h3>American Economic Observer to China, Mr. Buck, Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday. Does Not Wish to Make a Statement.</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that Mr. Buck, professor of agriculture at Jinling University, who was recently appointed by President Roosevelt as the American Economic Observer to China, first went to the Southwest to investigate its economic situation. He paid particular attention to the four provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi. He traveled through the small rural villages of various counties, talked with farmers, and inquired in detail about the work of the Gansu Provincial Government in these four provinces. Most of his work was done in Guangzhou, where he could find out about the commodities that were imported through that port and distributed to the rural areas of the provinces, as well as the agricultural products that were exported through that port. After the investigation was completed, he went to Hong Kong and took the Canada Maru to Shanghai, arriving on Sunday (the 11th). He will stay for a few days and then go to Nanjing to report. After arriving in Shanghai, he did not wish to make any statements to the news reporters.</p>

<h3>Loan Association: Matters to Which Attention is Hoped To Be Paid. Application Forms Should Not Be Falsely Filled Out or Decorated. If There is Unclarity, Pan Xulun Can Be Asked for Guidance.</h3>
<p>Since the Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee began reviewing and releasing loans on the first of this month, the number of applications and the amount approved have been announced. It is reported that since last Saturday, the number of applicants has been gradually increasing. However, it has been found that many of the guarantors listed in the various forms received have no address to be found, or the signatures lack official seals, or only the "Shujian" seal is affixed without signing the name. Even the contents of the forms are copied from each other, and even the numbers of assets and liabilities are the same. Various errors are too numerous to mention. Considering that the Loan Committee was originally established to help industry and commerce, in name and in fact, applicants should first take care of their creditworthiness. Application forms should not be falsely filled out or decorated with the hope of obtaining loan approval, temporarily deceiving and damaging their own credit. It is hoped that future applicants will pay close attention to avoid repeating the same mistakes and being rejected. If there are any difficulties or unclear loan procedures, they can go to 190 Ningbo Road. Mr. Pan Xulun, who is known for his enthusiasm for social causes and has long been praised by the people of Shanghai, is completely volunteering to fulfill his obligations to the applicants.</p>

<h3>Central Trust Bureau to Receive Spring Order. China Industrial Bank's Prize Savings. China-France Savings Society to be Completely Received. Universal Savings Society Has Decided on Measures. Date of Trust Bureau Opening Not Decided.</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Central Bank Trust Bureau Preparatory Office, after receiving the China-France Savings Society, the China Industrial Bank Savings Department's special prize savings has also been ordered to be transferred. The case of the Universal Savings Society has been agreed upon. The bureau is about to open. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Receiving China-France: Nearing Completion</p>
<p>After the China-France Savings Society was ordered by the Ministry of Finance on July 3 to be completely transferred to the Central Bank Trust Bureau, the Central Bank Trust Bureau Preparatory Office sent personnel to receive it separately. Because the society's head office and branches are spread across the country, although the initial reception has been completed, the review of the society's assets and liabilities has not yet been completed. After completion, it will be handled by the Trust Bureau. It is reported that the society's assets and liabilities can offset each other. According to the loan balance sheet as of the end of the 21st year of the Republic of China, both the asset amount and the liability amount are 4,392,148 yuan, 8 jiao, and 3 fen.</p>
<p>China Industrial Bank's Prize Savings: Ordered to be Transferred</p>
<p>The China Industrial Bank Savings Department established a special prize savings in the 22nd year of the Republic of China with 100,000 numbers as one session. Each number pays 30 yuan at once, and the stipulated period is eight years. Upon expiration, in addition to returning the principal, each number is given an interest of 4 yuan and 1 jiao. The lottery is drawn every three months. After 32 times, it is completely full. More than 61,000 numbers have joined, totaling more than 1.8 million yuan. Soon after, it was ordered to stop accepting new customers, but those who have already joined will continue until the eight-year term expires. Now the bank has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to transfer the closed prize savings of the Savings Society to the Central Trust Bureau for handling. At the same time, the bureau's preparatory office has been ordered to receive it.</p>
<p>Universal Savings Society: Disposal Measures The Universal Savings Society stopped operating its branches in various parts of China on July 1, but the Shanghai General Association, as well as the Guangzhou, Hankou, Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao branches, continue to operate as usual. As for the lottery draw on the 15th of each month, it is also held as usual. The Ministry of Finance, because the laws and regulations promulgated by the government stipulate that prize savings are prohibited, in addition to transferring the China-France Savings Society and the China Industrial Bank Prize Savings Department to the Central Trust Bureau for handling,</p>
<p>Trust Bureau: Preparing to Open</p>
<p>The Central Bank Trust Bureau, located on Hankou Road, has completed all arrangements. The director and deputy director have been decided. According to the New Voice News Agency reporter, the bureau is now actively preparing. As for the opening date, it has not yet been decided. It is expected to be implemented before the end of this month. The rumor of the 15th is probably due to insufficient preparation. In addition, the Ministry of Finance will guarantee the interests of the savings account holders of prize savings. The purpose of receiving the China-France Savings Society and the China Industrial Bank Prize Savings this time is to protect the interests of the savings account holders.</p>
<h3>July: Shanghai Goods Exported to the United States Statistics: Increase Compared to Last Year</h3>

In the first seven months of this year, Shanghai's exports to the US were worth a total of US$9,774,183, while in the same period last year they were US$7,221,382. Shanghai's exports to the Philippine Islands in July saw a significant decrease, with a total of US$82,274.

<h3>Shanghai Shipping Merchants Continue to Elect Representatives to Persuade Yu. Please have him withdraw his resignation.</h3>
<p>Yu Hede, the standing chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Trade Association, submitted his resignation due to feeling that the affairs were difficult to handle, leading to the retention of all Shanghai shipping merchants. For the first time, the member shipping companies jointly elected Chen Ganqing and others as shipping merchant representatives to retain Mr. Yu and ask him to support the overall situation, reluctantly taking on the difficult task to maintain the stability of the community. At that time, Mr. Yu did not express his views, but at this juncture when the shipping industry's survival is at stake, we rely on the leadership of experienced individuals. Therefore, all shipping merchants convened a general meeting of all members at the Shipping Club at 10 Guangdong Road at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss continuing to send representatives to earnestly retain Mr. Yu and have him withdraw his resignation. After public resolution, Chen Ganqing, Yuan Ludeng, Ye Chuanfang, Zhang Zhanlin, Chen Yisheng, and Feng Youxin were elected as representatives of all members to go to the Sanbei Company to retain Yu Qiaqing and cancel his resignation, and asked him to resume his duties soon.</p>
<h3>Special Rent Reduction Committee: Rent Reduction Movement Week, from the 25th of This Month to the End</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Rent Reduction Committee's first executive committee meeting resolved to hold a conference to revitalize the market and unify the rent reduction movement, scheduled for one week, from the 25th to the 31st of this month, named "Rent Reduction Movement Week." The standing members of the committee, such as Li Ao-kui, have drafted a plan, which will be handled and implemented by the publicity department. Excerpts of the committee's announcement to all citizens and the regulations passed for organizing rent reduction branches are recorded below:</p>
<p>Announcement to Citizens</p>
<p>The rent reduction announcement states: "Regarding rent reduction, it is not a thorough solution to social and economic problems, but when implemented in the current Shanghai society, it can be said to be an effective remedy for regulating the social economy and ensuring social peace and order. Regulating the social economy is not only for the sake of the common people but also for the wealthy. In large cities, industry and commerce are the focus. If industry and commerce decline, the city also declines. Currently, Shanghai society can be said to have declined to an extreme. A large number of bankrupt and unemployed people are being forced to leave Shanghai one after another, resulting in many vacant houses. Landlords would rather keep their houses empty than reduce rents. They really do not understand how to ensure social peace and order. The result of an unbalanced social economy is social unrest, leading to tragedies of crime. Reducing rents is the primary method for revitalizing the market and an important plan for solving people's livelihood problems. The environment is such, the facts are such, and the reasons are also such. The so-called rent reduction is to regulate the social economy, ensure social peace and order, and revive urban prosperity. Our citizens should all take responsibility, work on the rent reduction movement, and work together to achieve the goal of unified rent reduction. This is a special announcement." Shanghai Special Rent Reduction Committee.</p>

<h3>Industrial and Commercial Revitalization Association Hosted Factory Owners for the Second Time Yesterday: Requesting Factories to Genuinely Assist with Investigation Work; Representatives Zhou Yuantai and Others Expressed Willingness to Cooperate</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Revitalization Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held its first reception for factory owners and representatives at the Chamber yesterday at 4:00 PM. Attendees included representatives from Kailin Paint Company, Zhongnan Factory, Zhenhua Paint Company, Tianyuan Condiment Factory, Jiuda Silk Factory, Hu Wanxing Iron Factory, Dashun Factory, Tianyuan Jiuji Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Shanghai First Foundry, Gongli Socks Factory, Huanyu Pharmaceutical Factory, Yaguang Manufacturing Company, Dongfang Nianhong Company, Jincheng Pottery Company, Huatong Electric Factory, and others. Xi Yushu and Xu Xiaochu, the director and deputy director of the investigation team, and Ren Jinping, the general secretary, warmly received the guests. At 4:30 PM,</p>
<p>Xi Yushu, the Chairman</p>
<p>Delivered a speech, stating: "Today is the second time our association is hosting factory owners and representatives. The purpose is to allow industry leaders to understand the significance of our association's preliminary work procedures so that we can cooperate in a spirit of mutual assistance and seek effective relief, so that the hope of industrial and commercial revitalization can gradually become a reality. Since ancient times, China's industrial and commercial enterprises have been mired in an environment of increasing import surpluses and outflow of silver, making development inherently difficult. Recently, the global economic crisis has swept over China again, coupled with the impact of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, resulting in a sharp drop in land prices and a tightening of credit. The working capital used by industry and commerce for production has suddenly become scarce. Therefore, the production status of industry and commerce has shown an unprecedentedly tragic scene. If we do not seek relief urgently, we will inevitably move towards collapse, and both the national economy and the people's livelihood will be harmed. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in view of this, has risen up and hired leaders and experts from various industries to work together. Viewed superficially, it may seem slow, but if we want to recover from fatigue and decline, we must not treat the superficial symptoms without addressing the underlying causes of the decline. It is like a patient who only asks the doctor to treat the external symptoms while concealing the internal causes of the disease, which will inevitably lead to a recurrence of the external symptoms. Today, our association invites you all to come here to cooperate in accordance with the preliminary work procedures, striving to identify the internal causes of the decline of industry and commerce, as well as the causes of these internal illnesses. As for the issues of stagnation of working capital, which are the external symptoms, we are also actively researching them and have not ignored them." Then,</p>
<p>Ren Jinping Presented</p>
<p>His views, stating: "The reasons for the decline of industry and commerce in our country today, in terms of external symptoms, are the dumping of foreign goods, the outflow of silver, the decline in land prices, the shortage of working capital, and the sharp drop in purchasing power, which are all well known. In terms of internal illnesses, the lack of sound economic and personnel organizations is also generally known. Therefore, we must conduct a thorough study of the causes of both external symptoms and internal illnesses. Now, I will just talk about the reasons for the unsound economic and personnel organizations of industry and commerce, based on my personal experience, for the education of those engaged in business today. Often, due to their own weak financial resources, they reduce expenses on management and employees, which leads to a situation where business is not progressing, personnel are in disarray, and the economy is insufficient. Other shortcomings arise from this. These shortcomings weaken the internal structure of the business, making it unable to defend against the aforementioned external attacks. Therefore, in my personal opinion, the meaning of managing a business is the same as governing a country. The goal of governing a country is twofold: internally, to ensure the safety of the people's lives, and externally, to defend against aggression. But to be able to defend against aggression, we must first ensure the safety of the people's lives. Otherwise, we will not only be unable to defend against external attacks, but we will also be unable to obtain assistance from others. Even if we obtain assistance, it will still be ineffective. For example, if an unemployed person needs 20 yuan per month to live on, but is unable to live due to economic difficulties and must rely on a loan for assistance, if someone lends him 100 yuan and he still does not engage in production, he will still be unable to live as before in the sixth month. Therefore, if industry and commerce expect to be rescued by others, they must study and eliminate the reasons that hinder their own production and demonstrate a spirit worthy of rescue, so that people believe that after obtaining rescue, they will be able to increase production. In this way, industry and commerce must urgently study the reasons that hinder their own production. The method of studying the reasons is to first emphasize statistics, so that the advantages and disadvantages of various situations can be analyzed by statistical methods.</p>
<p>I will cite a few examples to illustrate</p>
<p>(1) The time when the general manager or factory director arrives at the office is often after 11:00 AM, which shows that the general manager or factory director spends more than one hour of his thoughts, energy, and time every day, which means that the business reduces its ability to advance by more than one hour every day. (2) If the sales destination of a product is Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, it shows that the sales potential is not being fully realized, and the domestic market outside of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the overseas markets outside the national boundary are being abandoned. (3) The differences between business operators and employees are examples, and the advantages and disadvantages of any other matter can be analyzed by statistical methods. Our association wants to ask you to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the investigation work in detail and train the personnel to increase their ability. Therefore, if industry and commerce want to expect economic assistance, they must find ways to clearly distinguish between advantages and disadvantages and eliminate or reduce the causes of weakness in the internal structure of the business. If the internal structure of the business gradually becomes stronger and healthier, the business's credit will inevitably increase, and it will be easier to obtain economic assistance. After obtaining economic assistance, it can strive for the survival of the business internally and resist economic aggression externally." Finally, the survey forms were distributed, and representatives from various factories, such as Zhou Yuantai, expressed their sincerity in cooperating with the association. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>City Federation Branch: Contributing Opinions on Industrial and Commercial Revitalization: Requesting the Municipal Council to Reduce Land Prices, Banks Should Provide Loans with Domestic Goods as Collateral</h3>
<p>Shanghai Special District City Federation 21st District Branch:</p>
<p>Shanghai Special District City Federation 21st District Branch, in view of the recession in all industries in Shanghai since the January 28th Incident and the lack of means to maintain them, the association has formulated opinions and sent a letter to the Industrial and Commercial Revitalization Committee for discussion. The original text states: "It is said that action is more valuable than words, and action is more valuable than eloquent rhetoric. This is an ancient saying. All matters, large or small, are based on practical action. Otherwise, the speaker is earnest, but the listener is dismissive. It is like the ancient proverb that says, 'Seek truth from facts, do not engage in empty talk.' Since the January 28th Incident, all industries in Shanghai have been declining and difficult to recover. The society is depressed, the economy is in panic, the countryside is bankrupt, and industry and commerce are struggling to survive. This is truly a time of crisis and survival. Enlightened people in our city deeply feel the difficulty of the situation and the collapse of all industries. They have organized the Industrial and Commercial Revitalization Committee, gathering leaders and experts from various industries to discuss and study the causes of the decline of all industries and the development plan, determine the plan, and assist in the implementation, so that things can be accomplished. Our colleagues in the association are very happy to hear this, believing that revitalizing industry and commerce is the most urgent task at present and cannot be delayed. According to the economic panic in our city in recent years, nothing is more serious than this. The causes are indeed several: (1) Property transfers and mortgages, one after another, repeatedly increasing the mortgage loans. Creditors, for the sake of interest, have to raise rents, and this burden is added to industry and commerce. At this time, the purchasing power of the bankrupt rural areas is not strong, especially for small industry and commerce, who are depleting their resources and unable to maintain themselves. Shops are closing down every day. This should be prevented. Anyone who has already mortgaged their property should not be allowed to transfer the mortgage again, in order to manipulate the situation. (2) Land prices in our city have been increasing year by year. Those with real estate have to raise rents due to the cost of building houses. In this situation, merchants and people are already overwhelmed and are crying for rent reduction, but the results are very few. The Municipal Council should be asked to reduce the land prices in the city to the lowest possible level. If this is implemented, then rents will be reduced without being reduced. To seek the revitalization of industry and commerce, this is the most important and fundamental issue that should be resolved immediately. (3) Banks are the financial hub of the city. The interest rate on loans should be reduced as much as possible, and should not exceed 7%, to reduce the burden on commerce. All banks should also quickly open up loans with domestic goods as collateral, stipulating a certain amount, or with a standard of 500 yuan or more and 1,000 yuan or less, so that the finances of small industry and commerce can be circulated and avoid the risk of being cut off from funds. Saving a part of industry and commerce can maintain the increase in domestic goods production. Without this, it is not worth considering other plans, because it is like disregarding the root and only focusing on the branches. Our association is aware of this and cannot remain silent. We hereby contribute our opinions."</p>
<h3>Wax Industry Association Reports on the Situation: Factories and Kilns Must Use Domestic Goods to Reverse the Decline</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Wax Industry Association, having previously received an order from the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the status of the industry, has completed the investigation and submitted it to the Bureau for review yesterday by mail. The original report and investigation form are recorded below: (Report) A report on the submission of a report. On July 26th, the Bureau issued Order No. 6393, stating, "In order to rescue commerce, the Bureau previously prepared a Shanghai Business Situation Investigation Form and ordered all industry associations in April of this year to conduct a thorough investigation and discussion in accordance with the form and report back, with a deadline of one month. The association has been overdue for a long time. It is hereby ordered that the association promptly comply with the previous order and report in detail within fifteen days of receiving this document. Any delays will be punished." Having received this, we should comply with the previously received form, fill it out truthfully, and submit it separately. We hope that the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu, will review it and bestow his virtue. Respectfully submitted. "The current situation of the industry": (1) The changes and overview of business operations over the years. Although the wax industry has not changed over the years, during times of social tranquility and prosperity, it relied on the pure profits of business operations to cover various expenses. If there were surpluses, they were minimal. (2) The recent business situation and the reasons for its rise and fall. Since the January 28th Incident, the market has gradually declined, and prices have fluctuated, resulting in the industry's annual turnover being reduced to about 40% compared to 1920. Those with weak funds have no choice but to change their profession or close down. (3) Sales and manufacturing situation. The goods purchased by the wax industry are purchased in cash from refineries in Sichuan, Jingzhou, or Taiwen in Zhejiang, so they do not manufacture themselves. (4) Sales situation. When wax is in stock, it is sold to imperial factories and candle kilns. Before 1921, those with national savings, even if they lacked good prices, could earn about 5 yuan in pure profit for every 100 yuan of goods. Nowadays, if they want to sell goods and seek wealth, they have to lose money or exhaust their capital. (5) Comparison of the rise and fall of market prices over the years or the past year and its main reasons. During the period of stable prices, there was a slight profit when wax was sold. It is recalled that in January and February of 1921, the prices in the producing areas rose sharply. By September of that year, each clod was sold for 48 or 49 yuan. Afterwards, it plummeted to 27 or 28 yuan. In the autumn of 1923, it fell to just over 17 yuan. The highest price this year was 25 yuan, and the lowest price was 20.2 yuan, lacking buyers (each clod weighs about 57 kilograms). (6) The competition between this industry and foreign goods. The wax industry belongs to the sales industry, and except for ○○ oil, there is no competition with other industries. (7) Difficulties and relief or improvement strategies in the industry. The difficulties in the wax industry are that goods are purchased in cash, but sales are on credit, and after credit is extended, it is like there is no end in sight. Recently, foreign dealers lack the ability to digest the goods, and local soap factories and candle kilns have profited by using ○○ oil and other products, resulting in the industry not being able to make profits and losing capital. Therefore, the gross profit income is not enough to cover expenses. If relief is desired, it is useless to persuade the aforementioned factories and kilns to use domestic products. (8) The total number of employees serving in this industry and their treatment. There are nine members in the association, with about sixty-four or five employees. During the service period, in addition to the salary they should receive, there are also monthly regulations and other expenses. When dividends (bonuses) are distributed, they are determined based on the position. (9) The shops that have newly opened, reorganized, and closed down in recent years and the reasons for them. Within 1921, two shops were reorganized, and the reasons for the shops that closed down were decline and loss of capital. (10) The reports from this industry that have recently joined and not joined the association have resulted in the inability to create a report.</p>

<h3>China Aviation Association Actively Promoting Aviation Carnival and Dance Hall Donations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Solicitation Team Office of the China Aviation Association held its 14th office meeting at the office at 5:30 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 11th) to discuss matters related to solicitation and fundraising. The attendees included Chief Executive Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Li Wenyao, Li Jiming, Liu Songtao, Chen Shuo, Song Zheng, Xue Baolun, Wei Jianxin, Gu Shangrui, Zhang Xiamin, Bao Lengxue, Zhu Shengyang, and Lu Zhangyan. Chief Executive Li chaired the meeting, and Chen Shuo recorded the minutes. The chairman's report briefly stated that the solicitation teams were working very hard on solicitation, and the detailed situation of membership fees and donations paid had been announced separately. In addition to expanding the solicitation of members, the team leaders also carried out various fundraising activities. For example, Chen Lihua, the leader of Team 249, suggested holding an aviation swimming competition at the Liangjiang Swimming Pool, which was held yesterday, and the ticket revenue of several hundred yuan was all transferred to solicit donations. Zhang Shichuan, the leader of Team 74, and Hu Die, the leader of Team 302, proposed to hold an aviation carnival, which has been decided to be held on the evenings of the 17th and 18th of this month at the Lapee Garden, with male and female stars from the Star Film Company performing various entertainment and dramas. In recent days, people from all walks of life have been buying tickets very enthusiastically, and it is expected that the results will be considerable in the future. The solicitation of donations from freight trucks is still going smoothly, but some trucking companies said that business was slow and they could not pay the money on time. After persuasion, they have gradually made up for it. It is planned to convene the persons in charge of the association within a few days to discuss effective measures to make it more and more prosperous. For the truck drivers in the brick and tile industry who owed donations, the office had previously sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting assistance in persuading them to pay the donations, which was very enthusiastic. All staff members are responsible for the inspection of the industry and should earnestly perform their duties and work hard. If any arrears are encountered during the inspection, they should be persuaded to pay. If they still resist, they should immediately report to the office for effective collection and request the public security organs to strictly deal with them, so as not to affect the entire process. As for the collection of dance guest tickets in the dance hall industry, since the trial run on the 22nd of last month, the results have been excellent. Previously, the authorities of the concession expressed their strong support. The implementation of this donation is scheduled to officially begin in all dance halls in the city on the 15th of this month. All staff members should earnestly work hard to assist the dance halls in carrying out the activities. The office will pay more attention to the consumption aspect of the donations collected from various industries, and now it is planned to conduct a donation for the film industry, first conduct the first step of investigation, and then handle it. Subsequently, after the external affairs secretaries reported on the work situation, the meeting discussed the solicitation of donations and the implementation of various plans until 7:50 p.m. The female stars of the Star Film Company, and the male and female stars led by Ms. Hu Die, will perform various entertainment programs, and Mr. Xu Zhuodai's newly compiled patriotic comedy "The Wife of the Republic of China" will be held at Lapee Garden from 8:00 p.m. on the 17th and 18th of this month. Tickets are sold for two yuan, and ticket sales locations are at Pushi Road, Fenglin Bridge, Star Company, and Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, Foo An, Guanshengyuan, Ma Baoshan Companies, International Hotel, National Goods Commercial Center, and the first floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, and the China Aviation Association General Captain's Office. In recent days, ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life have been rushing to the above locations to purchase or order tickets by mail, which is very enthusiastic. The seats are limited, and there are not many tickets left, so please purchase them as soon as possible to avoid the regret of not getting a seat. Yesterday, the General Captain's Office convened representatives from dance halls throughout the city to discuss the collection of aviation donations. The attendees included Zhu Jingchou, representing the St. Anna Garden, Chen Yingjun, representing the Lapee Garden, Zhang Lin representing the Yangzi Dance Hall, Yang Ronggen representing the Yuegong Dance Hall, and Hu Yongnian representing the Laodahua Dance Hall and the Shunfeng Dance Hall, and more than a dozen others. Li Dachao, Chief Executive of the General Captain's Office, Zhang Yuliang, Chen Shuo, Li Wenyao, Bao Lengxue, etc., Chief Executive Li Dachao chaired the meeting, and Chen Shuo recorded the minutes. The chairman's report briefly stated that today's meeting was convened to discuss the collection of aviation donations from various dance halls. Since the trial run on the 22nd of last month, the results have been excellent. Now, a letter has been received from the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, and the consuls have agreed to strongly support the implementation of the aforementioned donations. Mr. Cao Bingsheng, a supervisor from the Political Affairs Office of the French Concession Police, came to the office and stated that he supported the collection of aviation donations from various dance halls and that it could be implemented immediately. The office also requested the municipal government to provide assistance and maintenance, and decided to officially collect the donations immediately, hoping that all dance halls would provide as much assistance as possible and work hard to handle the matter. Subsequently, representatives from the Yangzi, Laodahua, Yuegong, and St. Anna dance halls successively stated that the collection of the aforementioned donations was to support fundraising, and that they should do their best to handle it.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai West National Exhibition Site is Determined to Be Inside the Zhaoji Middle School Sports Field</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Goods has been working hard to design and promote the sales channels of factory members' products. The recent National Goods Exhibition in Luohang Xujiahui achieved particularly excellent results, with the prosperity of merchandise sales setting an unprecedented record for national exhibitions in various districts of the city, providing a great boost to the financial regulation of participating factories, and leaving a particularly enthusiastic impression in promoting the national goods movement. It is learned that the association, in response to applications from small and medium-sized factories, will continue to expand the promotion of national goods and implement relief for overproduction, and has approved the joint letter from the Third District Branch of the Citizens' Federation and other public organizations, requesting that it lead various factories in accordance with established cases, hold the Third Shanghai West National Goods Exhibition, and promote the spirit of the student national goods year movement, etc. After being passed by the Standing Committee, the matter was handed over to the Cooperation Section to be responsible for preparations. Members of the section, Lin Guyun and Xu Yunhui, together with Standing Committee members Chen Binghui, Xu Jianruo, and Fang Jiange, went to Shanghai West to meet with leaders of various public organizations and discuss the progress. The Wujiaochang, the lively center of Caojiadu in the factory residential area, namely the former Zhaoji Middle School sports field, was designated as the venue. At this time, major silk factories have started work, the number of residents has increased sharply, and the consumption power also has a tendency to be abundant. Moreover, the people there are densely populated, and business is prosperous. The industrial and commercial sectors have always been enthusiastic about using national goods, and the past two achievements have proven that there will be excellent results. Yesterday, the secretariat notified all factories to collect participation and registration rules. It is heard that improvements have been made and it has been decided to accommodate as many small factories and handicraft fire family factories as possible to show the meaning of universal relief and equal propaganda. The industry categories will still be restricted.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan: The 76th Batch Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhou Jingui and Ten Others Returned Home Aboard the Rokko Maru</p>
<p>The 76th batch of overseas Chinese who were forced to leave Japan, including Zhou Jingui, Chen Ruidian, Hu Wangfu, Zhu Jinying, Zhang Sanmei, Zhu Chengzhai, Liu Pinxiang (Qingtian, Zhejiang), Gao Tingji, Wang Xiuxing, and Li Jinmei (Ruian, Zhejiang), ten people in total, returned home aboard the Nippon Yusen Kaisha Rokko Maru from Tokyo, Nagoya, and other places. They arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 p.m. yesterday and were transported to Huishan Wharf. After landing, they were temporarily housed in the Laogongxin and Xinxin hotels. The situation was extremely miserable. It is planned to request relief from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Corrects Tariff on Imported Small Pieces of Cloth</h3>
<p>According to the report from the personnel sent to North China by the Municipal Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, foreign merchants in the area were importing cotton cloth in order to avoid higher tariffs, and were cutting whole pieces into small pieces, each about one yard long (commonly known as "yard blocks"), and declaring them for import. Because the tariff rate for small pieces is less than one-third of that for whole pieces, the cost can be reduced by at least one-quarter, and even doubled for light and thin materials. Not only is sales convenient, but it is also popular with the economically backward people of North China. Domestic cloth is almost extinct under its influence. At that time, this fact was nothing more than a serious stage caused by improper tax collection procedures by the customs. The association then submitted a letter to the Ministry of Finance requesting rectification. Yesterday, the association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance stating that the customs had classified cloths less than one meter long into various whole piece tariff categories for taxation. The Customs Office No. 6599 approval is recorded as follows: "Presented, I know. Regarding the issue of taxing broken cloths cut from overseas, it has now been verified that the customs has classified cotton cloths less than one meter long into various whole piece tariff categories and taxed them according to the total number of meters imported."</p>

<h3>Russian Car Crushes Rickshaw Driver; Deceased's Family Requests Compensation; Court Orders Driver to Post Bail</h3>
<p>Liu Xiren from Yancheng, 26 years old, was a rickshaw driver. His family lived at No. 55 Anle Lane, Nan Shi Wai Ma Road. At noon on the 8th of this month, he was carrying a passenger and pulling car No. 1405. He was traveling from north to south in an alley next to the Grand Theater when, at that time, Russian dentist Meizha happened to be riding in his own car No. 6705. The driver, Zhang Genyang, was speeding from the east. There was no time to brake, and the rickshaw was violently overturned, and Liu was seriously injured. When the police arrived, they immediately copied down the car number and reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which summoned an ambulance. Liu was sent to Jishi Hospital for treatment but was ineffective and died soon after. After the Chinese and Western detectives went to the scene of the accident to investigate, they took the body to the Philander Road Autopsy Station. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Wei, dispatched by the First Special District District Court, went to the station and verified the body. Head Chinese Police Xue Ziwen reported the previous situation. Russian Meizha also reported that he lived on Xiafei Road in the French Concession. He said that he was sitting in the back compartment of the car that day. At that time, it happened to be raining. He saw the yellow car coming out of the alley. The driver immediately braked to avoid it to the south, but it was too late and he was hit. At that time, the driving speed was only between fifteen and seventeen yards. Zhang Gen claimed to be 51 years old, from Changshu, and had been driving a car for 20 years. The rickshaw passed through the alley that day. Because it was from high to low, it was traveling quite fast. When he saw it, he immediately braked to avoid it, but it was too late. The deceased's wife, Liu Cui, claimed that several members of her family, old and young, depended on the deceased for a living. Now that he had been killed in a car accident, she requested compensation of 5,000 yuan. The car driver claimed that the car was insured and he was unable to pay compensation. Because Mr. Guo feared that the deceased's family might need to file a private prosecution, he ordered the car driver to post bail in court so that he could be summoned when needed in the future. The car owner, Meizha, filed a case and promised to act as bail to prevent him from escaping. Mr. Guo then concluded that the deceased, Liu Xiren, male, was indeed injured and killed by car No. 6705 before his death. The body was handed over to the deceased's wife, Liu Cui, to be taken back for burial with a guarantee.</p>
<h3>Wife's Escape Incites Fury Towards In-laws: Butcher Knife Leads to Loss of Life; Zhu Ah-san Disregards Everything, By-stander Loses Life in Vain</h3>
<p>Local woman Xu Bu-shi, residing at No. 1297 Caojia渡, also runs the Xu He Ji butcher shop. She has two daughters. The elder daughter is married to local man Zhu Hong-kui, age thirty-nine. As Zhu is also a butcher, he helps manage the shop at Xu's place. The younger daughter once eloped, but was found by a local man named Zhu Ah-san, who returned her to her family. At the time, Zhu Ah-san was unmarried and asked someone to propose marriage to Xu, requesting her younger daughter as his wife. Xu agreed, and in October of last year, the two were married. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this month, Zhu Xu-shi suddenly fled without a trace. Despite her husband's extensive search, she could not be found. Filled with resentment, he suspected his mother-in-law, Xu Xia-shi, of collusion, and frequently went to argue. Yesterday afternoon, he went to cause trouble again. An argument quickly escalated into a quarrel with Xu Xia-shi, even leading to physical violence. Zhu Hong-kui and Zhu Mao-di's son, who were nearby, stepped forward to mediate, seeing that Ah-san was being unreasonable. Their words inevitably offended Ah-san. Unexpectedly, Ah-san became enraged and grabbed a sharp pig-butchering knife from the meat cutting board. He indiscriminately slashed at Hong-kui, Xu Xia-shi, and Mao-di's son, all of whom were severely wounded and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. By the time nearby patrol officers arrived, the perpetrator had already fled. They immediately reported the incident to the relevant police station for investigation and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. However, Zhu Mao-di's son died from his severe injuries. Zhu Hong-kui suffered a knife wound to the left abdomen, with his intestines protruding, and his life is in danger. Xu Xia-shi also suffered a knife wound to the left breast, and her condition is also critical.</p>
<h3>How Can One Bear to Take Advantage of Pleasure Seekers?: Stealing Money and Jewelry Before Departing; The Plight of the Female Tea Server is Pitiable; Shen Gen-xian Should Be Punished</h3>
<p>Chen Cai-yun, a woman from Songjiang, is currently twenty-five years old. Six years ago, she married Chen Shun-xing, who is engaged in farming, as his wife. They were able to make a modest living from farming. In recent years, rural areas have suffered economic hardship, leading to a decline in their family's circumstances and inability to maintain their livelihood. Therefore, Chen decided to seek another way out. In January of this year, Chen came to Shanghai alone, residing at No. 8 Songgui Lane, Baxianqiao, in the French Concession. Through an introduction, she became a No. 8 female server in the Tianyun Building game hall and movie theater of the Wing On Company. After dressing up, she completely shed the image of a country girl and became a modern Chengdu woman. Due to her difficult circumstances, she inevitably engaged in some irregular activities. A nineteen-year-old man named Shen Gen-xian, whose father works as a warehouse clerk at the Yuanshun Lumber Company at No. 1105 Guangfu Road in Zhabei, also works in the lumber company as an apprentice. Shen has always been fond of women and was immediately captivated by Chen upon meeting her. He ordered tea and had a conversation with Chen, and then requested that Chen join him for an evening out. Chen agreed. They agreed on a price of ten yuan for the night. Shen paid two five-yuan bills. At 11:00 PM, they went together to the Da Zhonghua Hotel at No. 200 Xizang Road, registered under the name Wang Ke-han, and entered room 218. After spending some time together, Chen fell into a deep sleep. She had a wallet containing the ten yuan given by Shen, as well as three gold rings worth approximately eighty yuan, which she placed on the table. Unexpectedly, Shen suddenly had a bad idea. Taking advantage of Chen's deep sleep, he stole the wallet and fled. When Chen woke up at 3:30 AM, she realized that Shen and her belongings were gone. She notified the tea server Ye Bingchu. Because Chen was already married, she did not report it to the police. Unexpectedly, Shen returned to the same place at 9:00 PM on the tenth. Chen Caiyun reported him, and the No. 18 guard of the building arrested Shen and took him to the Lao Zha police station. Huatan Pang Yutang investigated. Shen initially denied it, but after being identified by Ye Bingchu and others, he could no longer deny it. Officer Pang then went to Yuanshun Lumber Company and recovered the stolen three gold rings. Yesterday morning, he escorted them to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the situation and charged him with theft under Article 321, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. Because it was necessary to investigate whether the defendant had committed other similar cases, he requested a one-week adjournment. Chen Caiyun then provided evidence of the theft. Questioned by the defendant Shen Genxian, he also confessed. Judge Ye Shengchao then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Electric Company: Supplies Electricity to Songjiang and Qingpu Counties</h3>
<p>The electricity business in Zhujiajiao in Qingpu County and Songjiang County was originally supplied separately by the Zhupu and Songjiang electric light plants. However, in recent times, the number of electricity users in these two places has gradually increased, resulting in the original power generation of the two power plants being insufficient to supply the demand. Therefore, the respective power plants requested the Shanghai China Merchants Electric Company to lay lines to supply electricity to remedy the situation. It is understood that the China Merchants Electric Company has agreed and has separately negotiated draft contracts with the respective power plants. Regarding the amount of power supply, the Zhupu plant has a maximum limit of 600 kilowatts, and the Songjiang power plant has a temporary maximum limit of 800 kilowatts. The China Merchants Electric Company is now submitting it to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for approval.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers: Unwilling to Register, Returning to Native Places in Succession; Concerns Arise Over Fingerprinting; Vehicles are Left Idle, Cries of Hardship</h3>
<p>The rickshaw puller registration dispute in the French Concession. Since Mr. Du Yuesheng took office to mediate, all vehicles detained by the police for not being registered have been registered free of charge and released one after another. In order to avoid misunderstandings among the rickshaw pullers, many rickshaw owners also accompanied the rickshaw pullers to register together. Therefore, as of yesterday, among the 7,100 vehicles, there were actually 1,000 rickshaw pullers registered along with the rickshaw owners. Counting one rickshaw puller per vehicle, that is not a small number. However, rickshaw pullers who have already registered are making various speculations because of the nineteen fingerprints at the time of registration. Rickshaw pullers who have not yet registered are unwilling to accept the rickshaw owners' backtracking, so they are taking boats back to their native places in Jiangbei one after another to take temporary refuge. It is said that in recent days, the passenger ships of Datong and Dada companies sailing to Tongzhou, Gaogang, and Huojiaqiao have been carrying the most of these rickshaw pullers. Although the rickshaw owners have repeatedly tried to persuade them, there are still those who secretly leave at night with their baggage. Their embarrassed situation is very pitiful. Many rickshaw companies are unable to release vehicles for morning and evening shifts due to the reduction in rickshaw pullers. For example, there are more rickshaw households in the area around Lujiabang Road, and the vehicles that are left idle have been almost full for a month. Those who make a meager profit by renting out the vehicles on behalf of others, although the contract specifies a certain number of years, have to painfully terminate the lease and are in a dilemma because there is a vehicle but no one to pull it. Those who cannot settle down are taking the path of escape. Therefore, large and small rickshaw households are all suffering from the hardship of business suspension, and the expenses of donations cannot be stopped. They are all swallowing their anger and enduring this unexpected encounter. Considering only the number of municipal license donations, in the past, at least half of the people would go to pay around the tenth of each month, but now it is said that it is less than one-tenth. The rickshaw households dare not ask the authorities to extend the old license business because the established regulations are in place and it is not convenient to change them. Therefore, this phenomenon is related to the livelihood of the poor and should be given attention by the social sector.</p>

<h3>The Great China Case: Aftermath of the Settlement; The工部局 Files a Public Prosecution Again; Requesting the Court to Reopen the Debate; —The Countersuit for False Accusation Was Adjudicated Yesterday—</h3>
<p>The fire disaster that occurred on the night of June 28 at the Xiaoshadu Road factory of the Great China Celluloid Factory. After the disaster victims and the factory were involved in litigation, Mr. Du Yuesheng and lawyer Jin Yu acted as mediators and reached a peaceful settlement outside the court last week. All lawsuits filed by both parties against each other, if in the past, the court could approve the withdrawal upon the parties' application. However, since the implementation of the new law on July 1, there are slight differences and restrictions on the application for withdrawal of the prosecution in the self-prosecution case. Therefore, the factory authorities were self-prosecuted by 40 disaster victims, and the part about public danger could not be withdrawn according to law. The court debated the case last Tuesday and scheduled it for sentencing today (13th). However, the Public Concession Police Department paid special attention to this fire and conducted a rigorous investigation afterwards. The reason why it initially did not express anything was because the investigation was still not completed. Now it has completed the investigation and decided to file a public prosecution against the person in charge of the factory on behalf of the工部局 by lawyer Ru Baoyi of the bureau's legal team. Lawyer Ru applied to the First Special District Court yesterday morning to postpone the originally scheduled sentencing period because the factory was being self-prosecuted by the victims for public danger and will be sentenced today. He said that the工部局 believed that the factory fire was related to the interests of the Public Concession, and specifically participated in the lawsuit in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the Agreement. It should be approved to reopen the debate and reschedule the case for trial. Therefore, whether the judgment will still be announced according to the original schedule today, or the 工部局's application will be approved for re-examination, depends on the court's decision. In addition, after the disaster victims' representatives went to the factory to petition and a conflict occurred, the disaster victims self-prosecuted the chairman of the factory Zhu Rutang and Qian Menglin for injuries, and Zhu and Qian counter-sued Liu Shitong and other men and women for false accusations. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court opened the court. The police also sent many Chinese and foreign detectives to the court to assist the bailiffs in maintaining order. However, both parties did not appear in court because the case had been settled outside the court and they had applied for withdrawal of the self-prosecution. Only Gu Yongquan, the representative lawyer of Zhu and Qian, appeared. Judge Zhan declared that the case of injury filed by Liu Shitong and others had been withdrawn and the matter would not be accepted. However, the counter-prosecution for false accusations by Zhu Rutang and others could not be withdrawn according to law and should be conducted immediately. So lawyer Gu represented the two counter-prosecuting plaintiffs to state the case and asked to declare the counter-prosecuting defendants innocent. The court then announced the verdict after the conclusion of the debate. All the counter-prosecuted defendants were innocent.</p>
<h3>The Case of Confirming an Illegitimate Child: Sent Back for Retrial After Three Lawsuits; Zhang Wubo Abandons His Wife and Children; Forensic Examination Confirms That Zhang Zhi-di Was Born to Wubo; —Both Trials Were Lost, Only the Third Trial Was Sent Back—</h3>
<p>Zhang Wubo, a Ningbo native who runs Yongtaichang at No. 8, Taihefang, Sima Road, is 48 years old. In 1925, he met a woman named Fang Aying, who was only 14 years old at the time. Zhang seduced her because of her petite and clever nature and took her as his wife. He rented a house and cohabited with her. The following year, Fang gave birth to a son, whom Zhang named Zhimin (nickname Gougou). He loved him very much. Until 1928, Zhang suddenly made an excuse to go to Japan to do business, giving Fang 300 yuan as living expenses for her and her son. When he was about to leave, he still used the words "wait for his business to develop before holding a formal wedding" as a parting message. Therefore, Fang lived a reclusive life raising her son, but Zhang disappeared without a trace. Although she always felt the sadness of waiting for her lover, she still hoped for his return. A few years ago, she went out with her son and unexpectedly met Zhang on the way. Overjoyed to meet after a long separation, she immediately ordered her young son to call out "Father" and ask him to come home to enjoy the pleasure of family and talk about the sadness after parting.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Zhang now regarded the mother and son as strangers, turned his head and left, saying nothing. Fang was very angry and realized that his so-called going to Japan was a means of abandonment. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit against Zhang Wubo in the name of Zhimin's legal guardian to confirm the parent-child relationship. During the first trial, the defendant denied having a child with Fang. After the First Special District Court sent the child to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for examination, it was determined that he was indeed the same blood relative as the defendant and was born to the defendant. However, due to</p>
<p>other reasons</p>
<p>the First Instance Court did not consider it satisfactory, so the plaintiff's claim was rejected. Fang refused to accept it and immediately filed an appeal with the High Second Branch Court. During the court hearing, she stated that Zhang Wubo had suffered from inguinal lymphadenitis, a hidden disease that no outsider could know. This was sufficient to prove that she did live with Zhang, and the child was born during their cohabitation. There was also a forensic identification, requesting the annulment of the original judgment and confirming that Zhimin was Zhang's newly born son. However, the result of the second trial still rejected her appeal, saying that according to the provisions of the Civil Law, the right of an illegitimate child to request</p>
<p>paternal recognition</p>
<p>should be exercised within five years after the child's birth. If this right expires, it will be extinguished. Zhang Wubo is the biological father of Zhang Zhimin, but his request for recognition has passed the statutory period and should be rejected. Fang was not discouraged by the two defeats and continued to make efforts. She hired lawyer Chen Zhen to appeal to the Supreme Court, listing all the facts that she was seduced by Zhang into sexual intercourse when she was young, gave birth to a son, and then falsely claimed to go to Japan to do business and avoided seeing her. Then, after meeting on the road, he turned his eyes and acted as if he did not know her.</p>
<p>Betrayal</p>
<p>The reasons for the three points that caused her to be unable to accept the judgments of the first and second trials, and to request the annulment of the original judgment, so that all illegitimate children in the world can be spared from being fatherless children in the end. The Supreme Court recently collected the entire case file, and after a clear review, considered the second instance judgment to be particularly inappropriate and should not cite the statute of limitations for claims. Therefore, it abolished the principle and sent it to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for retrial. Yesterday morning, the High Second Branch Court opened the court. The appellant Zhang Wubo also hired lawyer Xiong to represent him in court, while the appellants Zhang Fang, Zhang Zhimin, and mother were represented by lawyer Chen Zhen. The court briefly inquired about the facts and then announced that the hearing would be adjourned for retrial after the witnesses were summoned.</p>

<h3>Robbery on Nanjing Road in the Southern District Last Night: Police and Thieves Exchange Fire, Bullets Fly But No One is Injured</h3>
<p>Li Xingchun, a man from Ningbo, 45 years old, has been working as a steward on Taizhou steamships. His home is located at No. 1, Qinben Lane, Wangjiazhai near Nanjing Road in the Southern District of Shanghai. Unexpectedly, at 10:30 last night, four robbers suddenly broke into his house, took out pistols, silenced the occupants, and robbed 15 silver dollars, a string of pearls, a gold bracelet, a gold bell, and two gold rings. At that time, Song Jiangshi, a neighbor of the Li family, happened to be chatting at Li Xingchun's house and was also held under surveillance by the robbers. The robbers forcibly seized two gold rings from the hands of Song Jiangshi and another neighbor, Jin Hushi, and then fled westward with the stolen goods. Liu Shaowu, the guard police officer from the 15th station, was patrolling in the area and was informed of the robbery. He immediately rushed to arrest the robbers. In a desperate situation, the robbers immediately opened fire to resist arrest. Officer Liu immediately returned fire. In an instant, gunfire erupted in Wangjiazhai, bullets flew everywhere, and passersby fled in panic. Both sides fired more than a dozen shots. Fortunately, no one was injured. The robbers, realizing the unfavorable situation due to the large number of people cooling off on the streets, did not dare to stay any longer and took the opportunity to escape into the dark alleys, disappearing without a trace. They were not apprehended. Officer Liu then returned to the police station to report the incident.</p>
<h3>Frequent Robberies in Yinxiang Port After Prolonged Warfare</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday, three robbers suddenly entered a cigarette shop at No. 495 Yinxiang Port Town, Yangshupu, in eastern Shanghai. Two of them were armed with pistols. They broke into the shop and ordered everyone not to move or make a sound. They also forced the shopkeeper to hand over the keys and rummaged through boxes and chests, looting wantonly. After about half an hour, they left with their loot. Afterwards, the owner checked his losses, which amounted to more than 120 silver dollars. As the robbers had already fled far away, he reported the incident to the Yinxiang District Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation and pursuit.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Taicang Bus Damages Property and Injures Person While Avoiding Funeral Procession</h3>
<p>At about 2:00 PM yesterday, a long-distance bus from the Shanghai-Taicang Bus Company, traveling south on Datong Road, Zhabei, near the Xiajialong intersection, swerved to avoid a funeral procession. The driver, Liu Yongfa, caused the glass of the shop sign of the Beishun Dananhuo Store to be smashed and fall, injuring the head of a pedestrian, Xu Ajin. Huang Weijin, the police officer from the 16th station, took the injured person and the driver, Liu Yongfa, to the Xinza District Bureau.

<h3>Failure in Watermelon Business Leads to Suicide by Drowning; Zhang Yu's Light Matter Costs a Life</h3>
<p>Zhang Yuting, a native of Pudong, used to be in the fruit business. After retiring a few years ago, he opened a fruit shop in Chuansha, Pudong. However, business was slow last spring, leading to losses and the closure of the shop. He then came to Shanghai to seek employment but was unsuccessful. Zhang believed that the watermelon business in the fruit trade was booming in the summer, so he and a friend, Wang, jointly invested in the direct purchase and sale of watermelons from various production areas to Shanghai. Last autumn, after accounting, they made a considerable profit and were overjoyed. This year, after the beginning of summer, the two jointly invested in the watermelon business again, each contributing 300 silver dollars. They agreed that Zhang would be responsible for purchasing goods from farmers in the inland production areas and transporting them to Shanghai, while Wang would be responsible for selling the goods in Shanghai. However, after Zhang shipped the goods to Shanghai this summer, the market was poor. Initially, the highest price was only over two silver dollars per load, but later, with the influx of goods and poor quality, the market price plummeted, now selling for only forty or fifty cents. The weather has been rainy for days, and with the arrival of the Autumn Begins festival, sales have declined. Zhang transported watermelons to Shanghai the day before yesterday and met with Wang. After the two accounted for their finances, they found that all the capital had been lost. Zhang stated that the capital he invested was borrowed from relatives and friends at high interest, with a repayment deadline of the end of the seventh lunar month. Yesterday, Zhang told Wang that there were still four or five hundred watermelons in Tangqi that had not been shipped to Shanghai. In the morning, Zhang went to the boat of the carrier, Yang, and asked Yang to return to transport the goods. When Yang's boat sailed to the Dujiahang shore of the South Huangpu River, Zhang suddenly jumped into the river and committed suicide. The boatmen saw this, stopped the boat, and tried to rescue him for a long time, but were unsuccessful. Yang sent his assistant to Shanghai to inform Wang, who immediately rushed to Zhang's home in Chuansha to report the incident. Wang and Zhang's wife then went to the scene of the incident to retrieve the body for burial.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Crack Down on "Red Pill" Case, Further Investigation Underway</h3>
<p>Inspector Jin Jiulin, detectives Zhou Buguang, and Yang Yilong of the French Concession Police learned on the afternoon of the 10th that someone was privately setting up a "Red Pill" manufacturing plant in the pavilion of No. 6, Sanxingfang, Lane 940, Beile Road. They immediately led detectives, including Zuo Qihong, to search the premises. They arrested Wang Pengshi (26 years old), a woman from Haimen, on the spot, and seized 40,000 "Red Pills." They brought her back to the police station, where she stated that the boss was Gu Jinkui (26 years old) from Pudong, and the engineer was Xu Yade (28 years old), also from Pudong, residing at No. 492, Beile Road. Based on this information, the detectives went to No. 492, Beile Road, to arrest the two men. There, they found Pi and Yu playing mahjong with their employees, Wu Shengshun (40 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 102, Guling Road) and Zhang Caihe (28 years old, from Pudong). They were all arrested and searched, but nothing was found. Gu confessed that the manufacturing equipment was hidden in the house at No. 277, Lafayette Road. The detectives went to the address and seized a full set of pill-making equipment, 800 trademark papers, 900 paper bags, and 50 sheets of oil paper. They brought them all back to the police station and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Li Changnian conducted the trial. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the Police Affairs Department, presented the case, stating that the defendants were arrested by the Police Affairs Department for privately manufacturing opium substitutes, and a detailed investigation was still needed. He requested that the defendants be detained temporarily and the case be postponed for eight days to clarify the facts and prosecute them. Detective Zuo Qihong then reported the details of the case and presented the evidence. The court verified the information and questioned the defendants. The court then granted the postponement and ordered the defendants to be detained pending further investigation.</p>

However, according to Article 248 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the withdrawal of a lawsuit should be done in writing. As this procedure was not yet completed, the case was postponed. Yesterday morning, Jiang Baolian, the police lawyer, prepared the written request for withdrawal and submitted it to Feng Shide, the Chief of the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The defendants' lawyers, Fan Gang, Wu Linkun, and Zhao Chuanding, all requested that the bail bonds be canceled.

Director Cai presented a plaque at 9:00 AM on the 11th to express his gratitude. The plaque was inscribed by Municipal Government Secretary Zha Weihan and titled "He Bian Fuxing." The text reads: "My constitution has always been weak, and I often feel unwell in the summer heat. This year, I contracted typhoid fever from a cold. I changed doctors several times without success, but I was cured by Dr. Yan's careful diagnosis and treatment, with the assistance of Dr. Zhu Qi. I am deeply grateful for the regeneration and sing praises of his divine skills. I write this as a record."

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Wang Shapa)</p>
<p>The Chinese people don't seem to be very interested or happy about anything else, but they are particularly fond of gambling, especially mahjong. I really can't figure out how these small 136 mahjong tiles have such a great magical power of seduction? The family of Ah Mao, the chauffeur who lives in the front building of our house, plays mahjong four weeks out of the month. The second landlord in the厢房 also has a table set up often. Even the Shandong fellows working as road construction workers in the alley, every night, have to go to the tiger stove across the street to play a few "铲" five hundred "铲". Many women would rather put aside their housework and play eight or twelve rounds. Some people even find it not enjoyable enough to gamble at home, and they even rent hotels to gamble big, as if they can eat less, but they can't stop playing mahjong? In fact, playing mahjong is the most uneconomical thing. Thinking about it, it's really a little tasteless. When four people sit down to gamble, there are winners and losers. However, losing money is still a small matter. The loss of spirit and the waste of time are probably greater than losing money.</p>
<h3>Model Women's Prison</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>A friend who returned from studying in France told me, "In the French province of Fresnes, there is a women's prison. Serving time in this prison is more comfortable than living at home."</p>
<p>He said, "This prison is like a villa. The squares and flower beds are arranged into a large square garden.</p>
<p>"In this prison, children are allowed to stay with their mothers. According to their regulations, mothers are not allowed to abandon their children if they commit crimes. At the very least, they must stay with their children until they are four years old before being separated. However, in reality, mothers and children are often inseparable, and they are released together after the mother's sentence expires.</p>
<p>"The prison buildings are similar to other prisons, with iron bars for security. However, these frightening iron bars are painted in pleasant colors. The lighting at night is also very good. Each prisoner's room has a large bed and a small bed or a cradle. Everything is similar to living in a dormitory, except that they do not have the freedom to leave. However, their children can play outside in the yard all day long.</p>
<p>"The prison guards in this prison do not treat the female prisoners with children with harsh expressions, to prevent the children from having a bad impression that will be forever imprinted on their minds.</p>
<p>"Therefore, women who are released from that prison after serving their sentences often become good people because they have been influenced for the better."</p>
<p>It is said that in France, this prison is called the "French Model Women's Prison," and they are preparing to implement this prison system nationwide.</p>
<h3>Poetry Riddles</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Poetry riddles, also known as "poetry treasures," involve taking a line from a five- or seven-character poem, or an ancient-style poem, removing one character, and adding four identical characters next to the line, allowing people to guess. The winner receives triple the bet. This is truly a game of gambling with poetry. During the Qing Dynasty, during the annual civil service examinations, idle scholars would set up stalls next to the examination hall, luring candidates to participate. Although these candidates had some literary knowledge and could recite a few examination poems, they found it difficult to figure out good riddles and usually lost nine out of ten times, leaving them with empty pockets. As for poetry riddles in Shanghai, they first appeared next to the grain depot behind the City God Temple, occasionally set up outdoors during the New Year, with the participants being mostly peddlers and laborers. Even though they were illiterate, they found it interesting to guess based on the "treasure path." Around 1922-1923, someone started setting up stalls in the New World Amusement Park, offering white tin-foiled "Craven A" cigarettes as prizes. As a result, men and women with little literacy pretended to be poets, pondering and guessing. The business flourished, and one stall turned into more than ten. Subsequently, the Great World and other amusement parks also followed suit. Various associations and street corners also had poetry riddles set up, creating a surging trend that surpassed even the stock market frenzy of that year. It is feared that many people were ruined and driven to suicide as a result. After this trend lasted for two or three years, people got tired of it, and the authorities cracked down on it. As a result, the "poetry masters" disappeared, and the riddle strips were put away. Currently, only the Guan Yun Poetry Collection on Avenue Edward VII remains, but the business is not thriving.</p>
<p>Poetry riddles originated from ancient hidden language and cryptic words, similar to "shooting covers." The best riddle strips are balanced in five characters, seamless, and truly make the guessers feel confused and difficult to grasp. Some deliberately use awkward sentences and vulgar words, which is like using unorthodox tactics in warfare. It may work once in a while, but using it too much will not be effective. Later, cunning people used plum blossom scripts to create the strips, which was no different from cheating in Pai Gow. As a result, scholars stayed away, and the "riddle fortune" came to an end.</p>
<h3>All Men Share the Same Heart, Hearts Share the Same Reason.</h3>
<p>— Juan Yin</p>
<h3>Kissing</h3>
<p>— Jian Wen</p>
<p>Is kissing a kind of epidemic? Physiologists should admit that it is. Just imagine, when lips touch lips, isn't it easy to transmit germs?</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, the lips are tactile organs, with extremely sensitive feelings, and are an important tool for human expression. Smiling, containing anger, pursing lips, anger... can all be revealed through the movement of the lips. Movie actors pay great attention to these changes in lip movements. Because kissing is a behavior that excites emotions and expresses affection.</p>
<p>For this reason, young people and middle-aged people like to kiss children, which is certainly not objectionable; young people and young people, middle-aged people and middle-aged people, men and women kissing each other, we have no reason to criticize. But why is kissing considered a secret that cannot be made public in Chinese society?</p>
<p>It is said that when French soldiers receive medals, the officers kiss the soldiers on both cheeks as a solemn ceremony. This shows that kissing can be regarded as a different kind of perversion in societies that do not have this custom, and is considered a secret and shameful thing.</p>
<p>In the future, for the sake of health and hygiene, we should not arbitrarily kiss innocent children; for the sake of respecting people's freedom of expression, we should not take the kissing between middle-aged and young people too seriously!</p>
<p>Local Customs</p>
<h3>Japanese Cleanliness Campaign</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Foreigners who have been to China always say that China is unclean and unhygienic. Since the New Life Movement has been carried out in various places, the public may gradually pay attention to it. Now I will present the Japanese cleanliness campaign to the readers as a reference.</p>
<p>Japanese houses are all made of wood and are not painted, so they are theoretically easy to get dirty. However, they all have straw mats inside, filled with rice husks underneath. Walking on them with indoor socks is very soft. Every morning after getting up, the housewife sprinkles wet tea leaves on the mats, wears a mask, and sweeps the room. Then, she wipes the windows and railings with a damp cloth. The outdoor floor is also wiped with a damp cloth. Holding the rag with both hands, she bends forward and pushes forward, which we call "driving a streetcar." The handrails in the stairwell and the toilets must also be washed by hand. Very few Japanese families hire maids, and most of them are done by the housewives themselves.</p>
<p>Each household has a wooden trash can at the door, with the words "For the exclusive use of so-and-so" written on it. Every morning, the street cleaners shake a bell and come to sweep. The streets or sidewalks outside the door are swept two or three times a day, sometimes with a long-handled palm brush. They like to sprinkle water on the road to prevent dust. Fortunately, they all wear leather shoes and clogs, which does not interfere with this. In China, it may be annoying to pedestrians.</p>
<p>Taking a bath for five cents is a daily routine for Japanese people. They wash their bodies clean before soaking in the bath, so the water in the pool is always very clear. Ordinary bathwater contains carbolic acid, and those along the coast use seawater. They shave themselves and shave their sons' heads in the bathhouse without spending a penny.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also flies. Once, in a public cemetery, I saw thousands of flies on the tombstones. I don't know why. They usually keep many pieces of white paper in their pockets to wipe their noses. But there are no fewer people spitting everywhere than in our country, but it is not common indoors. Also, laborers often urinate at will by the ditches in the small alleys. Even in Japan, which is famous for its cleanliness, this bad habit is still difficult to completely correct. If our country can pay attention to it, it may not be inferior to them.</p>
<p>The Japanese police do a good job. They don't often stay in the station, but often carry household registration books to check everywhere. So how many people are in each household and how they act cannot escape their eyes and ears. Restaurants and hotels are inspected very strictly, and kitchens and toilets must be inspected. As long as there is no stinky disinfectant in the spittoon, there is a risk of punishment. General cleaning is held several times a year, approximately on a certain date. During the cleaning, the heavy objects in the house are moved to the sidewalk for a thorough cleaning.</p>
<p>Around six or seven in the morning, all the shop assistants are mobilized to clean, and the counters and display windows are spotless. The glass doors along the street are wiped once or twice a day. The things used in the barbershop are usually soaked in disinfectant, and only taken out when they are used. The beard and soap foam shaved off are wiped on white paper and not thrown away. Barbers, regardless of gender, wear masks to protect their mouths from the heat, which may disgust customers.</p>
<p>The excrement is handled by the city government, which hires workers to dump the excrement from people's homes. It is also loaded with buckets, which are tightly covered and will never spill out, and there is not much odor. More than a dozen manure buckets are loaded on a two-wheeled truck, covered with oilcloth, and carried by hand to the warehouse. The time for dumping manure seems to be in the morning and afternoon, but there is no specific time.</p>

<p>Zhiqian continued: If it's about helping a little, I can't say I can't do it. How about this, I'll give you some money so you can buy some snacks on the road. Saying this, he took out a five-yuan bill from his pocket and placed it on the table in front of Wanhua. Wanhua couldn't help but show a smile on her face. Holding onto the table, she stood up and said: Thank you, thank you! I have no other choice. Saying this, she lowered her head to look at the bill. Zhiqian said: Just take it, I took it out, of course, I don't mean it falsely. If you think it's too little... Wanhua shook her head and said: I would never dare. Only then did she slowly put the bill into her pocket. As if there was something else, not very comfortable, she sat down again, forcing a smile and saying: I'm really embarrassed, I have no relationship with Mr. Cheng, but I'm costing Mr. Cheng. Zhiqian smiled: Only because I'm in a detached position, I can help a little. Otherwise, why would I take out this money, that would be too difficult. Wanhua sat down again, lowering her head. Zhiqian was afraid that she would have some other requests, so he lit a cigarette for guests and smoked it very boredly. Wanhua slowly raised her head and asked: Mr. Cheng will probably have to stay in Xi'an for some time, right? Zhiqian said: That's not certain. Wanhua tidied her hair, smiled and said: Your wife must miss you very much at home. Zhiqian said: I'm always out and about, so it doesn't matter. Wanhua lowered her head, raised her hands, and slowly flipped them over to look, asking: Will Mr. Cheng have guests coming tonight? Zhiqian said sternly: Miss Yang, I've already said, I'm purely helping you a little, you don't need to think too much. I should go out to see friends. (288)</p>
<h3>Records of Piao Miao Royal Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At this time, the eyes of all the people were already firmly fixed on that green carpet-like lotus grove; I myself was especially excited, my two eyes desperately enlarged, enlarging and enlarging again—just like those plump buds were enlarging at the same time. Indeed, they were enlarging there too! Hundreds, thousands of them, wherever our sight could reach, all had their shadows, none of them were not enlarging, shaking, and releasing.</p>
<p>The sun rose higher and higher, already half hung up.</p>
<p>Those thousands of hundreds of buds were also opening bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>As the sun rose completely and the lotus flowers bloomed completely, a fresh, fragrant smell was added to the air, blowing over our heads, stroking our sides, and it seemed that people's breaths were also fragrant. This is the most lovely lotus fragrance! At that time, half of the eastern rosy clouds had covered half of the sky, and were about to invade the west. Those lotus buds attracted the attention of every spectator, and everyone felt that this was the most lovely scene, each bud was like a child's small fist, and those petals were even more like plump, white, and tender little fingers; when they opened, it was exactly like a child waking up and slowly unfolding his little fist, which was indeed worthy of appreciation.</p>
<p>Because I had just heard the Empress Dowager say that we should "listen", so I pricked up my ears and listened attentively; in reality, I couldn't hear any sound at all, only because I was influenced by psychological effects; I seemed to really have heard the rustling sound of those lotus flowers opening (388)</p>

<h3>One Move, Two Benefits, Exciting Program Today's Charity Tennis Exhibition Match Singles Xu Chengji First Fights Lin Baohua Starts at 4 PM at Singapore Road</h3>
<p>The charity tennis match that has been in preparation for many days will be held at the Chinese Tennis Club on Singapore Road starting at 4 pm today. It is also a farewell performance by Xu Chengji, our country's representative to the Davis Cup, in Shanghai. Mr. Xu's performances in Shanghai recently have been highly praised. Today's first singles match against Lin Baohua will be particularly exciting. Because Lin's chop shot has previously embarrassed Mr. Xu, the battle will definitely be exciting. Both of them are known for their cannonball serves, and the outcome is very worth watching. Whether Mr. Xu will come to the National Games is undecided, so it is even more important not to miss this opportunity to appreciate the skills and help the disaster victims, a charity event with two benefits in one move. Today, Director Wu Xingya will perform the opening ceremony, and Mrs. Wu will present the awards. The competition order is as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. Xu Chengji, our country's Davis Cup representative, will leave Shanghai on the 15th to return to Java. Whether he can come back to participate in the National Games before the Double Tenth Festival is still in question.

Mr. Lin Binhua will compete with Mr. Karlson, who has returned to Shanghai from the United States, to compare their skills. They will perform a singles match at 4 pm tomorrow to learn from each other. The weather has been uncertain these days. The grass court is difficult to use after heavy rain.

<h3>The Current Status and Plan of Compulsory Education in Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— (Report by Zhou Fo-hai at the Jiangsu Provincial Government Memorial Week)</p>
<p>According to simple statistics for Jiangsu's compulsory education in the 19th year of the Republic (August 1930 to July 1931), there were only over 7,350 primary schools, over 12,700 elementary levels, and only over 580,000 enrolled children. There were approximately over 3.9 million children who were not enrolled. The percentage of enrolled children was only about 12.6%. When I took office, I witnessed such a situation and believed that it was imperative to find a way to provide relief quickly. At the same time, because the educational funds of the counties had been arbitrarily and abusively used for many years, resulting in extreme disorder and mostly deficits, it was naturally impossible to expand the undertaking further. Therefore, for the work of promoting compulsory education, only the following measures were decided: (1) increasing enrollment; (2) improving private schools; (3) encouraging private individuals to establish schools; (4) stipulating that primary schools should be established in townships. Although the ideal goal has not been achieved in the past four years, according to concise statistical figures, it cannot be said that there has been no progress. According to the statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic, the number of schools has increased to 9,053, the number of levels has increased to 16,682, and the number of enrolled children has increased to 800,489. The percentage of enrolled children has also increased to 14.8%. This slight progress, although a drop in the bucket and of no help in alleviating the difficulties of the time, in a time of declining people's livelihoods and the prevalence of natural disasters, this situation has made me feel mentally and physically exhausted.</p>
<p>Between February and March of this year, I felt that although Zhenjiang was the provincial capital, the number of out-of-school children was even higher than in the counties around Suzhou, Changzhou, Shanghai, and Haifeng, and it was deemed necessary to provide relief urgently. Therefore, it was planned to allocate a portion of the provincial education funds to establish several compulsory education schools in the urban area of the provincial capital as a partial remedy. Coincidentally, the Ministry of Education also had plans to subsidize the management of compulsory education. Upon receiving this news, this department sent personnel to the Ministry of Education for multiple consultations, requesting more funding to facilitate progress. Later, the Ministry of Education telegraphed to require that at least half of the funds be raised locally in order to be eligible for the supplementary funds. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education personally came to Zhenjiang and, together with Chairman Chen and myself, jointly agreed on the amount of funding to be allocated. As a result, it was decided that the province would raise 150,000 yuan, and the central government would also allocate 150,000 yuan. Currently, the province has decided to allocate 100,000 yuan from the provincial education fund's overseas study fee item and 50,000 yuan from the provincial treasury. The central government has already telegraphed its agreement to provide 120,000 yuan. After sending personnel to the ministry to vigorously advocate, it is estimated that another 30,000 yuan can be allocated from the Boxer Indemnity funds to make up 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Now that the funds have been secured, it is necessary to formulate a plan to prepare for implementation. In the past two weeks, a provincial compulsory education committee meeting was held, and the proposed implementation plan was passed. The content of the plan can be divided into several aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Source of Funding</p>
<p>(1) The province will raise 150,000 yuan, and the central government will subsidize 150,000 yuan, for a total of 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The counties will raise or apportion the start-up costs locally, including equipment and school building repairs, estimated at approximately 300,000 yuan. 50 of the 61 counties must raise half of the operating expenses themselves. This amount will be used from the county's general reserve fund or the education endowment fund, totaling approximately 110,000 yuan. The total of items 1 and 2 reaches over 700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Implementation Methods</p>
<p>(A) Number of Levels to Be Established (excluding Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County): A. 100 levels in the urban area of the provincial capital; B. 50 levels each in Lishui, Gaochun, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Yangzhou, Yizheng, Jurong, Donghai, Huaiyin, and Guanyun counties, totaling 500 levels. If the full start-up costs cannot be raised immediately, they can be established in spring and autumn; C. 10 to 15 levels each in the other 50 counties, totaling 750 levels.</p>
<p>A total of 1,350 levels will be added.</p>
<p>(B) Content of Management: A. At least half of the newly established levels should be one-year short-term primary schools and must adopt a two-shift system; B. The regular elementary school levels in the newly established levels should also adopt a two-shift system; C. The number of students per level in the newly established levels must be at least 50, taught by one teacher. However, in principle, each teacher in the two-shift system should teach 100 students; D. The locations for establishing levels in each county should prioritize areas with more out-of-school children. The number of enrolled children added is estimated at 700 levels with a two-shift system, with 100 students per level, totaling 70,000 students; 650 levels with 50 students per level, totaling 32,500 students, for a total of 102,500 students.</p>
<p>(3) Teachers</p>
<p>(1) Teachers in the urban area of the provincial capital: The provincial normal schools and rural normal schools have been ordered to recommend outstanding graduates of this year to be selected; this is sufficient. (2) Lishui and other ten counties: Because many levels are being established, there is a shortage of teachers. In addition to prioritizing graduates of provincial and county normal schools, teachers for the levels established in the spring can be filled by high school graduates who have been trained for three months. (3) Other counties will mainly employ graduates of provincial and county normal schools or recruit through examinations.</p>
<p>(4) Allocation of Funds</p>
<p>(1) A total of 750 newly added levels in each county at 150 yuan (half) each, totaling 112,500 yuan; (2) A total of 500 levels in Lishui and other ten counties at 300 yuan each, totaling 150,000 yuan; (3) A total of 100 levels in the provincial capital at 250 yuan each, totaling 35,000 yuan; (4) Reserve fund of 2,500 yuan, totaling 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(5) School Buildings and Equipment</p>
<p>(1) School buildings: Utilize public venues, or build simple sheds, or rent private houses; (2) Equipment should be as simple as possible; students can bring their own desks and chairs. The content of the plan is as described above. The number of levels to be established in each county has already been notified for compliance, and a deadline has been set for submitting plans for review. In the provincial capital, a preparatory committee will be established separately, inviting enthusiastic local gentlemen to assist jointly. The first step, investigating the number of school-age children and the number of out-of-school children, has already been investigated and clarified. There are approximately 8,367 out-of-school children in the urban area, of which 3,584 children aged 9 to 12 can enter short-term primary schools. There are 56 usable school buildings, such as public offices, ancestral halls, and temples, which can accommodate about 60 levels. The insufficient number still requires the construction of sheds or the rental of private houses. Regarding the progress steps, a preparatory committee meeting was also held, and it was resolved that Mr. Leng Yuhui, Mr. Lu Xiaobo, and Mr. Yan Huiyu would be responsible for borrowing 15,000 yuan for start-up costs. Regarding the determination of school locations, planning of school building equipment, solicitation of private donations of school equipment and teaching materials, appointment of principals, and selection of teachers, there have been proposals and decisions. Regarding compulsory enrollment methods, steps have also been discussed, namely, first, persuasion; second, posting names for warning; and third, fines of one to five yuan. We are now proceeding step by step according to the plan.</p>
<p>This time, the central government and the province are using all their strength to focus on the implementation and promotion of compulsory education, and I believe that considerable results will be achieved. However, after several months of preparation, I feel that the most difficult thing is still the funding. Fortunately, according to the above plan, the operating expenses are settled. The remaining problems are only the start-up costs and the problem of school buildings and school equipment. The start-up costs are stipulated to be raised or apportioned. Although this seems to increase the burden on the people, the start-up costs only need to be paid once and then it is finished, unlike the operating expenses that need to be borne every year. Moreover, paying once makes it more convenient for the children to go to school with one more primary school in the local area, so I hope that local people will actively donate. It is estimated that 100 yuan is enough for the start-up costs per level. If each family contributes one yuan, 100 families can raise 100 yuan, and the burden cannot be considered heavy. As for school buildings and school equipment, I hope that local people will, on the one hand, lend ancestral halls and temples as school buildings, and on the other hand, donate unnecessary tables and chairs from their homes. We can then work hard in a simple and economical manner. If our comrades in the party and government agencies can vigorously advocate and promote, I think it will definitely be promoted in the society. I hope everyone will work hard! (End)</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Issues Order to Adopt World Primary and Secondary School Textbooks</h3>
<p>In order to meet educational needs, the Ministry of Education has formulated new curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools.

<h3>Finance: Big Players Sell Off, Standard Gold Price Retreats to the Hundred Yuan Mark, Banks Try to Prop Up…Resulting in a Five Yuan Drop</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw big players such as Yuan Mao Yong and others actively selling, and even dumping foreign exchange, resulting in an overwhelming bearish sentiment in the market. It once pushed the price down to the 900 yuan mark. The Indian silver market was continuously shrinking. In the end, the situation was relatively stable. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market saw flat trading in both England and America. The forward silver price in Monte Carlo shrunk by 6 hao and rose by no more than 2%. Exchange rates were stable. The price of raw gold in London shrunk by half a penny. People's hearts were still stable. As for the news reported that the Economic Research Committee of the Central Bank had decided to control exchange rates, the date of actual implementation is still far away, so it had no special impact. Over-the-counter trading opened at 90 yuan, which was higher than the previous Saturday, but weaker than the after-hours trading the previous night. Although Hui Xiang, Heng Yu and others bought in, Fu Xing, Yong Da and De Cheng sold out and showed hesitation. After opening, the exchange rate hardened and people's hearts were bearish. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both English and American exchange rates unchanged and the customs gold unit unchanged. The standard gold price was 919 yuan and 8 jiao. It happened to be the time for big players to compete to sell, so it fell. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to maintain support. HSBC listed its prices, with both English and American exchange rates also unchanged, allowing it to hold the market. Banks took advantage of the low prices to buy back positions, gradually stabilizing the market. Commercial banks such as Shanghai Continental all bought back positions. The domestic market tightened and once rebounded, but because big players such as Yuan Mao Yong and others did not stop selling, the market soon fell again. People's hearts were also tired. Therefore, even though banks bought back positions after entering the market, it was still difficult to boost the market. The Indian silver forecast was unchanged, so it had little impact. After entering the market, short sellers increased their positions. The market lacked substantial support. It once fell to the 900 yuan mark. Buyers saw the low prices and became active. The market tended to stabilize at noon. Later, the market rose because of HSBC's strong buying and the softening of the Hong Kong market. Domestic goods were dumped for US dollars, and sellers took advantage of the high prices to become active. After the high, there was a decline, but because Tong Yi acted on behalf of a certain spot gold player and bought in continuously, and the Indian silver market reported a shrinkage of 1 anna, the market mostly fluctuated. Near the end, big players such as Yuan Mao Yong and Fu Xing Yong sold off again and again, and people's hearts were difficult to support. In addition, Yuan Mao Yong continued to dump heavily, and the domestic foreign exchange market became even harder, so it fell within the 900 yuan mark. However, because banks still bought back positions at low prices, the Indian silver market shrunk by another 2 annas for the second time, and finally stabilized again. Although the overall trend of the day was surrounded by bearish sentiment, it seemed that because the Hong Kong market was soft and HSBC absorbed strongly, the market fell but fluctuated a lot along the way. The market situation for today is recorded as follows:</p>

As a result, it fell by 5 yuan compared to the previous Saturday.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on the Central Bank's standard gold price of 919 yuan and 8 jiao, which was about 17 yuan higher than the closing price, which was more than 4 yuan more than the previous Saturday. This month's registration was 899 yuan, September's was 901 yuan, the morning water price was 899 yuan, and the afternoon water price was 900 yuan.

<p>The in-market trading was average. The big players were still competing to provide supplies.

Today, the long side who were supposed to receive were Fu Xing Yong Heng Chang Yong with 7 gold bars each. The closing price was 899 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hua Merchants Sell Fiercely, Foreign Exchange Gradually Hardens, Hong Kong Market Reports Softness, HSBC Absorbs Greatly, The Process of the Day is Loose and Full of Profit-Taking</h3>

<h3>The Money Market is Stagnant</h3>
<p>Since the day before yesterday was Sunday, the entire financial community was closed as usual, and there were no collections or releases to record. The procedures that could not be sorted out were all carried out yesterday, so the collection and release aspect was slightly better than in the past. However, the situation in the market has become dull. The foreign exchange rate has never been high or low. The daily rate of 2 jiao in the morning and afternoon has become a habit and has lasted for more than a month. Because there is little competition for discount ticket transactions and for credit reasons, money shops that are generally confident in their weak strength dare not rush to seek discounts, so the market situation is cold, and the price has not risen or fallen. Yesterday was also the same. The morning and afternoon rates were still 2 jiao. The transfer head was also white, and no water was added. There was also no increase or decrease in the small general meeting. Everything was white. The transaction volume of discount tickets was 2.78 million in the morning and more than 300,000 in new transactions.

The amount of remittances from various roads was 670,000, and the amount of cash released was 340,000. As for the bank's collection and release, it was handled together with the day before yesterday, so the collection and release was more complicated. Foreign banks collected and released more than 1.4 million, and the collection and release of various goods, foreign exchange pledges, and miscellaneous loans was more than 4.89 million. The amount of telegraphic remittances was more than 800,000, the amount of import excess was more than 1.5 million, the amount of foreign exchange settlement was more than 800,000, and the amount of special remittances was more than 1.1 million.

<p>Recently, the market price of auxiliary coins has remained stable at more than 30 yuan per day due to the small number of transactions and little competition. Recently, transactions have been rare, and the Jiangjiao price has fallen again. The morning price was 35 yuan, and the afternoon price was 834 yuan, which was 1 yuan less than the previous day. The transaction volume was 2,000 jiao in the morning and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon. The Guangjiao price was 335 yuan and 8 jiao in the morning and 735 yuan in the afternoon, which was also 1 yuan and 3 jiao less than the previous afternoon.

<p>Yesterday, the Hua Merchant Securities Exchange extended its half-day trading for another week at the request of the brokers, so the market only traded in two sessions in the morning. The market situation was still dull and stagnant, but the entry and exit of major players showed some improvement. Number 48 absorbed the forward contract, and its appetite was quite strong. The morning opening price originally showed a downward trend, but it was able to rise slowly due to this support. However, Number 33 sold the recent contract, which seemed very eager, causing the market to suspect that the goods of Number 33 might be the ones that the bullish side of Number 48 had entrusted them to sell for the purpose of swapping. People's hearts began to doubt again, and the market price fell again in the second session. In short, the entry and exit of Number 48 now implicitly has the ability to influence the market. Because most of the over-the-counter transactions follow its lead. The future situation may not change much for a while. Yesterday's market results still showed mutual gains and losses. The total turnover was 7.61 million yuan. The comparative table of its high and low results is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower: The Spot Yarn Market Turns Unpredictable</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned weak again. The day before yesterday, it rose suddenly because it was rumored that someone was receiving 2,000 bales of goods. Today, the market atmosphere has changed, and the bullish side is afraid that there is no intention to receive goods. There are 1,000 pieces of Matcha yarn to be delivered, and the bullish side has the appearance of selling off, so the market suddenly fell and fell in every session. Recently, the yarn market has been rising and falling sharply, which is difficult to predict. However, the sales of spot yarn are more active. If various gangs can continue to come, it can help the market a lot.</p>
<p>Gold: Turned Down</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning, and the prices of all months fell uniformly, and the situation was greatly relaxed. Because the overseas cotton industry was dim, and the market floated on the previous day, saying that a certain gentleman was receiving goods this month, it is currently difficult to actually see that the situation is still far away. A certain yarn has the possibility of being delivered, and there is also a saying that 500 pieces have been delivered to the warehouse. Therefore, the market atmosphere was dispersed, and the bullish side also closed their positions. However, Dafu bought 3,400 bales on behalf of the Hankou gang, and as a result, the prices of each month fell by 1.2, 3, 4, and 5 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. After the afternoon opening, it was heard that the sales market for customers in the morning was still good and more smooth than before, and the popularity was slightly revived, and the prices of each month rose slightly by 2 or 3 jiao. However, the market saw a loosening again when it was filmed to close the market, because the bullish side continued to close their positions, and as a result, the prices of each month fell by 1, 2, and 4 jiao compared with the closing price of the morning. It was found that 1,100 bales were sold by Yu Da, 400 bales by Dafeng, 1,400 bales by Wei Feng, 2,450 bales by Hengchang, 500 bales by Tonghe, 550 bales by Renfeng, 400 bales by Dachangcheng, 400 bales by Run Kang, 3,450 bales were bought by Maoyi Dofu, 650 bales were recorded, 400 bales were promoted, 800 bales were sold by Taixing, 400 bales were sold by Changji, 800 bales were sold by Rui Da, 400 bales were sold by Chang Yu, 450 bales were sold by Changfeng, the highest and lowest prices of the day and the closing prices are as follows,</p>
<p>Actual Sales Increase</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are more active than before, and it was found that a total of 805 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the day. Quotations</p>
<h3>Forward Flowers Ningbo Gang Sells Off</h3>
<p>The cotton market in August is still rising, and the bullish side is very eager to squeeze the short side. According to the market, a major bank has delivered 10,000 dan of goods. The Ningbo Gang is selling a large amount of forward new cotton, and the situation is slightly depressed.</p>
<p>This Month's Flowers are Uniquely Elegant</p>
<p>The spot flower market opened in the morning, and the August contract was still firm, because the bullish side was closed and unwilling to let go, and they were determined to look higher. However, the Ningbo Gang closed the forward new flower contracts, wanting to see a small profit. In addition, the gold price was hovering around 900 yuan, and people's hearts were tired, and as a result, the price of this month fell by 1.5 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day, and the forward price fell by 3.5 to 4 jiao. The August contract opened firmly in the afternoon, and there was a lack of secret sellers, and the forward month was brought up. The market was slightly flat when it was filmed to close. As a result, the August contract rose by 2.5 jiao compared with the morning closing price, and the forward price rose by 5 points to 1.5 jiao. It was found that 1,500 dan were sold by Gengfeng, 1,000 dan by Tongji, 4,700 dan by Renfeng, 1,200 dan by Changfeng, 3,600 dan by Run Kang, 6,000 dan by Yuanxingchang, 1,600 dan by Tonghe, 7,600 dan by Maoyi Dofu, 1,600 dan by Yuanda, 1,000 dan by Changji, 1,100 dan by Yuan Yi, 1,100 dan by Taichang, 1,400 dan by Yichang, 1,600 dan by Shengyuan, 3,200 dan by Changhe, 1,200 dan by Run Kang, 1,800 dan by Xin, the highest and lowest prices of the day and the closing prices are as follows,</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Mills Few and Far Between</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still sluggish. Factory needs The source is Yao flowers</p>
<h3>The Harvest of Indian Cotton is Going Smoothly</h3>
<p>The most noteworthy thing in the futures market last week was the hold of the white Luo Creek flower in the July-August contract. Only 4,000 bales of white Luo Creek flowers were delivered, most of which were collected by well-known local cotton merchants. There were very few export inquiries, and the spot cotton foundation was better. However, because the quality was too hard, business was greatly affected. Factory imports were average. The harvest was unanimously smooth. A part of it was slightly too much rain and needed sunlight. The attached summary of last week is as follows: (unit: thousands of bales)</p>
<h3>Food: Spot Flour Market Buyers are Very Close</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month was rising. The quoted price of foreign wheat was about 3, 4, and 5 jiao for Chicago and 2 jiao for Canada. However, the market consensus was firm, because it was rumored that each factory was finding it difficult to import wheat and might stop production. On the other hand, there were rumors of foreign wheat control, so the outside short sellers were quite fearful and made great efforts to offset their positions. The outside bullish side was also rushing to buy step by step, so the buyers were very smooth. 200,000 to 400,000 bags were made in the morning, and the market rose by 2 or 3 points. By the afternoon, the trading volume for each month turned clear, and the market was slightly weak due to the opening of Tianjin. The market fell by half a point to 7 li compared with the morning. According to the situation of the month, it is very difficult to have a smooth and prosperous arrival of wheat in storage, and foreign wheat is difficult to transfer for a while, so the situation is stable. As a result, the current month was 1 point and 1 li and a half better, September and October rose by 2 points, November and November rose by 1 point and 7 li and a half, and January rose by 2 points and 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Spot Wheat Hearts are Universally High — High-Quality Wheat Opens to Seven Jiao and Beyond —</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot wheat market, when the morning opening price, all months were unanimously rising, because the foreign wheat was quoted at 2, 3, 4, or 5 jiao, but because the current foreign wheat exchange rate was low and shrunk, it has not been suitable for transfer for a long time, so in fact, it is easy for the bullish side to hold on. Recently, the inland wheat prices have been getting better step by step. High-quality wheat for Shanghai, Ningbo, and Jiangbei all needs about 7 or 8 jiao. With this impression, the people's hearts are very expensive, and the opening price for each month is 3 to 5 points higher. The afternoon opening price had a clear transaction volume, and the market was stable. However, the people in the industry are still optimistic, and as a result, the current month rose by 5 points, September rose by 4 points, and each of October to January rose by 3 points. The spot wheat market continued to be expensive, with high-quality wheat opening to 7 jiao and beyond, and the middle-quality wheat also rose by 3 to 5 points. The wheat price of Kaiming Guangguan Store was 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 2 points, the wheat price of Dongtai Gaoyou was 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 7 points, the wheat price of Luhe was 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 3 points, the wheat price of Yangzhou was 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 1 point, the secondary price was 6 jiao, the wheat price of Nanjing was 3 yuan and 4 jiao and 7 points, the wheat price of Wuyi was 3 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, and Shanfu Xin sold 6,000 bags.</p>
<h3>The Prices of Domestic and Foreign Rice Have Been Reduced</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources of rice (from the south of Shanghai) from various areas were similar to before, with a total of more than twenty shipments arriving (totaling over four thousand shi [unit of dry measure]). Sales in the market have been more active on this street, and buyers from Baoyuan and other areas continued to purchase over four hundred packages. The overall situation has slightly turned stable, appearing firm with a hint of tightness. As a result, the prices of thick japonica rice and thin indica rice have seen a reduction of several points in the central market, while higher-priced materials have generally held steady. In Dongxin, the price of clear-day rice continued to fall by two "chi" [unit of length], and the price of cloudy-day rice also declined slightly due to oversupply, depreciating by a few "jiao" [monetary unit]. The price of "Lujian" [a type of rice] followed the slightly stabilized price of japonica rice.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs in Hexia were sixteen or seventeen shipments. Various types of rice were sold in the market. The sales of polished japonica rice in the early market remained sluggish, with prices down by one or two "jiao". Sales became more active in the afternoon market, stabilizing prices. The sales of early rice were weak, with prices reduced by one to three "jiao". The price of thin indica rice also declined slightly, but the market has since stabilized. In Dongxin, twelve to thirteen hundred shi arrived, with retail sales being average and prices down slightly by one "jiao". Retail sales of polished "Baiyuan" rice were sluggish, with prices weak and down slightly. Although not much new "Jian" rice from Zhejiang arrived, retail sales were slow, and prices were reduced. The prices of other types of rice also declined slightly by a few "jiao".</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for foreign rice saw a decline in customer demand. There were no inquiries from the Hankou, Jiujiang, Quanzhou, and Nanjing gangs. The number of transactions decreased sharply. All grades of high and low-quality rice showed a downward trend. However, dealers were reluctant to sell cheaply due to high costs and unprofitable orders. Furthermore, the floating stock in Shanghai was less than two hundred thousand packages, so they insisted on not selling cheaply. However, smaller dealers were eager to sell, and the market generally appeared weak, down by a few points. Previously, there was competition between Tianjin and the inland for broken "Luo" rice, and the market price managed to hold steady. After a slight drop in Saigon small grain rice, local and inland buyers took advantage of the low prices to purchase, and the market price rebounded. Throughout the day, 2,550 packages of Saigon rice, 1,700 packages of Siamese rice, 700 packages of small grain, high-quality rice, and 80 packages of secondary machine-milled rice from Ningbo were sold. The market prices were similar to the previous market, but the quality of the rice was slightly softer.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Over a Thousand Packages of Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Sold by Tender</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a slight sign of weakness as the exchange rate of customs gold eased slightly. The Sugar Industry Cooperative sold 1,500 packages of "Five Rams" coarse white sugar by tender at a price of $17.05 per package, with 1,000 packages sold. Another 1,148 packages of slightly inferior sugar were sold at $16.85 per package, with 140 packages sold, both down by a small five cents. Additionally, 1,000 packages of medium granulated white sugar were sold at $16.40 per package, with 60 packages sold. The guild quoted the original prices for both spot and transit goods of "Ersi" coarse granulated white sugar, but no transactions were made. "Taikoo" B wheat sugar fell by five cents to $18.05. There were changes in the cotton white sugar from the local factory. The Chaozhou gang offered a few packages of "Huanggang Qingbai" at $9.90, and Chenzhi red sugar at $9.70. Dongbai sugar also fell slightly by five cents, with No. 4 sugar at $16.40 and No. 8 sugar at $16.20.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods: Xiamen Tangerine Peel Rises by Three Dollars</h3>
<p>Previously, Xiamen bridge tangerine peel had a small sales volume, and the opening price had fallen to as low as $21. However, as the losses were too great, the remaining goods were firmly held and not unloaded. Now, with the autumn sales season approaching, prices have gradually risen. The market price yesterday was $24.50, an increase of about three dollars. However, the old and inferior goods remain weak, with the better ones not even reaching ten dollars.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Sales of Asphalt in Hankou are Brisk, and Prices are Rising – Local Market Sellers Also Agree to Increase Prices –</h3>
<p>Asphalt sales are currently strong in the autumn season. Merchants in various places need to purchase various brands of goods to meet the demand for candles. The oil handled by local merchants is mainly produced in the Jingyi area of Hubei Province. However, they do not directly purchase goods from the production area but buy from merchants in Hankou. Therefore, Hankou is the central market. However, recently, there have been cases of ships directly transporting goods from Yichang to Shanghai for sale. As a result, the Shanghai market also receives Jing oil from direct shipments from the production area, which are cheaper per unit due to direct shipping than those purchased from Hankou. Shanghai merchants are also happy to purchase these goods. However, the arrival of goods in Hankou has gradually decreased, and there are fewer buyers than before. This is a change in the market. Currently, the inventory in Hankou is thinner than in previous years. Therefore, whenever there is a purchase, prices rise. Recently, the Hankou, Zhenning, Suzhou, and Shanghai gangs all want to purchase, but the Hankou merchants do not have enough to supply. The existing goods must be negotiated with the sellers. The sellers, seeing that there are more buyers, hoard and raise prices. Chongjing oil has increased from 12 taels per "chu" [unit of weight] to 13 taels and 6 qian. The lowest price for Macheng oil was 11 taels and 4 qian, and it has now increased to 12 taels, 8 qian, and 7 fen. The price increase is due to the scramble for purchases by various gangs. However, these are all for reserves and not due to genuine sales. Therefore, seeing that the prices have risen so much, buyers are hesitant and waiting for an opportunity. However, once the prices have risen, they will not easily fall. Local merchants, seeing the large price increase in Hankou, have also agreed to increase their selling prices, opening at 22 yuan and 24 jiao per chu for Chongjing oil, 22 yuan to 21 yuan and 68 jiao for Pingjing oil, and 19 yuan per city scale for Macheng oil.</p>

<h3>Art for Art's Sake and Art for Life's Sake</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>"Art for art's sake," which only emphasizes the "beauty of technique" in pure literature, not only seems theoretically impure but also has little standing in reality. Universally recognized great literary works throughout history do not contain such empty concepts; this is beyond doubt. Furthermore, the story of Oscar Wilde mentioned in André Gide's memoirs also reveals some information.</p>
<p>Oscar Wilde was a proponent of aestheticism, advocating that art should be detached from life and transcend it. He even more extremely praised pleasure and lamented the decadence of "lying," saying, "All bad art comes from returning to nature and life." However, when he entered prison for the sake of aesthetic living and saw the reality of life, his aestheticism shattered. He admitted that his previous heart, which only pursued beauty and pleasure, was "a heart like a stubborn stone," and this "heart like a stubborn stone" was broken by something called "compassion." When discussing Dostoevsky's works, he said the following:</p>
<p>"Russian writers are outstanding. What makes their works so great is the compassion they embody. I used to love reading 'Madame Bovary,' but Flaubert was unwilling to put compassion into his work, so his work seems petty and narrow; compassion makes the work expansive and great." (See Wilde's "The Critic as Artist," translated in the second issue of the second volume)</p>
<p>Shifting his love from Flaubert to Russian writers and advocating for compassion in works signifies that the aestheticism of "art for art's sake" ultimately succumbed to "art for life's sake."</p>
<p>When he favored Flaubert, Wilde opposed Zola. In his decadent "lying," he said:</p>
<p>"From an artistic point of view, Zola's works are almost worthless, deserving only zero points. The characters in his works are decadent and pitiful people, the crystallization of sin. Their lives are records without interest. Who can pay attention to these people? Our demand for art is rarity, charm, imagination, and simply, beauty."</p>
<p>The difference between Zola and Flaubert is precisely the difference between "art for life's sake" and "art for art's sake." Although Flaubert's realism does not deviate from the reality of life, he also said, "Life is empty, art is everything." He regarded art itself as the only absolute, while life was merely a model to be depicted. At the root of Zola's naturalistic writing attitude was compassion for life, so he had an idealistic desire to transform society. In this regard, Zola was closer to Russian writers than Flaubert. It was natural that Wilde opposed Zola when he favored Flaubert. But when he recognized compassion and disliked Flaubert's pettiness and narrowness, he would also have to change his attitude towards Zola and retract the above criticism—this was also natural.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of compassion is the fundamental distinction between "art for life's sake" and "art for art's sake," i.e., pure literature.</p>
<p>Mass literature, of course, should first be "art for life's sake"; it must have compassion. However, it cannot be said that all "art for life's sake" is mass literature.</p>
<p>For example, art that depicts the poor, the oppressed, and the starving is "art for life's sake" that embodies compassion. There have already been many such arts. Since the naturalistic movement, there have been countless works depicting workers and farmers. However, it cannot be said to be mass literature simply because it depicts workers and farmers. Why is this? It is because the author uses the eyes of an outsider or a privileged person to observe and depict, and because the author lacks a common consciousness or demand with the masses themselves.</p>
<p>For example, works that merely complain about the harshness of the living environment and express endless dissatisfaction and frustration are also "art for life's sake" that embodies compassion. However, the author cannot point out a positive attitude towards reality, the cultivation of labor and will, a new way of life, a constructive enthusiasm, and hatred for those bad inheritances—the old world—that are overcome by our difficulties and sufferings.</p>
<p>For example, depicting human psychology, exploring the secrets of the soul, showing the victory of human barbarity and selfish instincts, or pointing out the goodness of human nature is also "art for life's sake" that embodies negative or positive compassion. However, it cannot be said to be mass literature either. Why? Because the author only depicts individual psychology with a religious, ethical, or philosophical attitude but ignores the social and historical factors that determine all individual psychology, and this is its shortcoming.</p>
<p>Furthermore, pure literature, because it only seeks the "beauty of technique," specializes in carving and affectation, often using exaggerated metaphors or strange ancient language to make it difficult for readers to understand. And "art for art's sake" pure literature wants to transcend the real world and is satisfied with simply depicting empty beauty with technique. Naturalistic literature of "art for life's sake" explains, describes, and tastes everything in the world. Mass literature has its ideals. This is the most important point of distinction.</p>
<h3>Sparrows and Stove Bugs</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Those engaged in literature and art have long been deemed less useful than shoemakers, butchers, and barbers. Perhaps precisely because they are useless, society's treatment of them is meager, as can be imagined. People are not sparrows, but they have to live like sparrows on the roof. People are not stove bugs, but they have to gnaw on crumbs of bread crusts like stove bugs. If there is always a roof to live under and always crumbs of bread crusts to gnaw on, their attention may not be focused solely on this. But we must know that the fact is that today there is a roof to live under, but whether there will be one tomorrow is uncertain, or whether there is a roof to live under this month, but whether there will be one next month is uncertain. Whether there are crumbs of bread crusts to gnaw on today, and whether there will be any to gnaw on tomorrow, or whether there are bread crusts to gnaw on this month, but whether there will be any to gnaw on next month, is a serious and not insignificant problem for them. It is a slander against them to say that those engaged in literature and art lack artistic conscience. All artists are loyal to their art and strive to improve. They have ambition, and like Kleist, they want to snatch the poet's laurel from others' heads and put it on their own. But in order to plan for tomorrow's bread and housing, they have to write more and exchange it for meager稿費. This is due to the pressure of hunger and is not necessarily of their own free will. Squeezed-out bitter juice and sweat are only sought for sales, and naturally, there is no time to care about "curved" or "straight," "elegance" or "beauty." This is a matter for those few leisured artists who live well, and they have no time to care about it, nor do they have the economic ability to care about such things. Because they live in sparrow-like roofs, the air they breathe is polluted, and they cannot even see a patch of green grass, let alone a花圍別墅. The dirty alleys and the ragged and filthy characters that come out of them mean that inspiration cannot come from the outside, and the fire of hunger burns out from the inside. Picking up a pen to write is writing for a purpose, which fundamentally loses the condition of "leisure." Moreover, there are no cigars to smoke, no coffee to drink, and even a cup of bitter tea cannot be obtained. However, they can only write, write, and write endlessly until their hands cannot move. Shaking their hands is considered stretching their muscles, and looking outward is considered letting in air. Looking at the瓦 on the opposite side is considered relaxing. That's all. Articles written in this environment naturally do not have noble ladies as typical characters, nor do they have magnificent natural backgrounds as objects of description, nor do they have ancient books that speak of the soul as 引襯. Therefore, those "leisurely and elegant" artists who are full of ancient interest will have headaches when they see such articles and will find them uninteresting, thinking that Chinese magazines and newspapers are not worth reading and that only picture magazines for公子哥儿 and leisured people suit their tastes.</p>
<h3>Could Be Currie (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>That old man, Lian Lao, hurriedly pulled at his face, bending his waist a few times with a flattering smile, retreating to the table next to him with the enthusiasm of A Geng.</p>
<p>A Geng, naturally, was again reaching out to the shelf to get his own water bottle. As he put the tea leaves in, he secretly glanced this way. A Geng was clever at making money; he wanted to get back the "Daidaihua" tea that he had put in Master Shi's teapot from these two gentlemen. And he knew that even if they could taste the tea, they wouldn't dare to make a fuss in front of Director Shi.</p>
<p>They started talking. Without listening, A Geng knew what it was about: first, a while about the weather, how the sunshine and rain made people dizzy, and then about the rice harvest—they were both big landlords in Wujia Town, and these were the things they cared about most. They would never misreport the price挂牌 on the market by even a cent. A Geng never quite believed their methods and would go to the market after closing time to ask his friends, trying to figure out the connection—they never made a mistake. In the end, he'd pound his head, thinking that his own brain must be wired wrong.</p>
<p>He put the teapot on the two gentlemen's table, refilled Master Shi's cup, and turned around to look at the sun, which had already shone inside the threshold. Eight o'clock, thought A Geng, maybe he should remind Master Shi if he wanted a shaobing.</p>
<p>But they were talking enthusiastically. After the rice market, Old Mu talked about the return of the eldest son of the Lu family. He had gotten fat, wore foreign clothes, and walked with great authority. "And I heard he brought back two big trunks!" Old Mu also had Director Shi's trick, lowering his voice to a buzz like a fly over a manure pit. "His father specially invited me to dinner last night."</p>
<p>Normally, Director Shi would have jumped up. Who did Old Mu think he was? How dare the Lu family not invite me, Director Shi, to dinner! But Director Shi was completely different today. He smiled affably and said, "I heard it yesterday but didn't believe it. I wonder what the boy is like now?"</p>
<p>"Director, it's really unbelievable!" Lian Lao chimed in. He was also a guest of the Lu family, and feeling that Old Mu hadn't mentioned his visit was a slight to his face, he deliberately raised his voice half an octave. "Lu Quanfu insisted on dragging me along yesterday too. Ah Xing has changed completely after wandering around outside. He's very polite. At the dinner table, he talked about Shanghai, Hankou, Nanjing, all the many places he's been. He said he was doing business that had advantages of tens of thousands of silver taels, that's the small age, it's a loss for him..." Lian Lao blurted out, and suddenly felt like someone had punched him in the waist; Old Mu was winking at him to keep quiet. Only then did he see that Director Shi's eyes were as ugly as if his stomach was on fire. For a moment, he didn't know how to wind down and could only say "Yes, yes, yes" for a long time, ending with "That boy also sent his regards to the Director."</p>
<p>Although Lian Lao was anxious, he thought his lie was very clever.</p>
<p>In fact, Director Shi hadn't listened to everything Lian Lao said. After he confirmed that Lu Ah Xing had returned, his entire brain was turning over what A Geng couldn't have guessed as a "connection." It was Director Shi's masterpiece from back then: when he wanted to swallow a piece of land from Lu Quanfu, that little brat Ah Xing dared to try to topple me, Director Shi (he naturally wasn't a Director back then), a local tyrant and evil gentry or something, and almost tripped him up by a child. But Shi was not so easily stumped, his inch-long fingernails had rhythmically knocked on the table several times, he was already a glorious Director Shi, and Ah Xing's name was mixed in with those of xxx, scaring him into running away overnight. Director Shi never tired of telling his wife about this affair ten or a hundred times in exhaustive detail when he was tipsy, stroking his unkempt mustache.</p>
<p>Now, just thinking about it made Director Shi's eyes blaze. That little devil had returned to Wujia Town in a spirited manner, having made a fortune with two big trunks, inviting Lian Lao and Old Mu to dinner, but Director Shi didn't care about those! But that little devil was of unknown origin. Director Shi forgot to eat his shaobing and wasn't it because he was in "deep thought and long-range planning?" His brain naturally started working, and his inch-long fingernails were knocking on the table, but out of rhythm, like a sparrow's nest being knocked over, chirping and chirping.</p>
<p>Lian Lao couldn't guess whether the Director was having a poetic inspiration or if he had blurted something out? He gave Old Mu a look of exasperation, elegantly picked up his teacup, and took a sip of scalding tea, finally putting the heart that was about to jump out back in its nest.</p>
<p>A Geng originally didn't understand those "airs," and now he was slapping the back of his head as if he were standing in front of a funhouse mirror. There must be something wrong in his head, he muttered.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Director Shi slammed his palm on the table. This was a lapse in his self-control; Old Mu and Lian Lao were not like A Geng, this was a loss of "decency." They hurriedly put on smiling faces and said,</p>
<p>"This is the virtue accumulated by the Lu family ancestors, and also the happiness of Wujia Town!" He struck the table twice in a row as if to express his satisfaction. "That child has become good, I'll have to go see him in a while."</p>
<p>That way, the two gentlemen, acting like influenza patients, chimed in and hit the table.</p>
<p>Director Shi is Director Shi for a reason; this trick is beyond others.</p>
<p>The conversation came to an end, and the "connection" that A Geng couldn't figure out also came to an end in Director Shi's belly. "Could Be Currie" temporarily fell silent. The three scholars sipped their tea elegantly. A Geng was watching Old Mu and Lian Lao's mouths, thinking that if the two of them couldn't taste the tea, he could put even less "Daidaihua" tea in tomorrow. Turning to the idea of making money, A Geng's head wasn't wired wrong.</p>
<p>The sun shone into the threshold and then retreated. A Geng raised his hand to the street and estimated that it was already past five o'clock. He still remembered that Master Shi hadn't eaten his shaobing. Now that he had the chance, he coughed, this was not "airs," he wanted to attract Master Shi's attention, pulling out an touching tone, he called: "A Geng, make two shaobing!"</p>
<p>But Master Shi's attention was completely focused on that unfathomable "connection." Although he had slammed the table and tapped his fingernails, as a Director in "deep thought and long-range planning," he had to "think thrice before acting." That child's origins were unknown, and before he went to "take a look at him," he couldn't remember that he hadn't eaten his shaobing today.</p>

<h3>Seaside Tragedy (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Original by Honoré de Balzac, translated by Wang Jiansheng</p>
<p>Despite the sweltering heat of the day and the fatigue of the long journey, our souls were still filled with an indescribable, fervent joy. They overflowed with a pure happiness, a joy akin to that felt when listening to a melodious piece of music, such as Mozart's renowned "Let us go, my love." Two souls merged into a single, pure thought, just as two beautiful voices harmonize in a song.</p>
<p>To fully understand the emotions that later assailed us, you must share the unconstrained joy we experienced during our morning stroll. If you were to sit for a moment and observe a wild dove perched on a branch overhanging a small stream, its vibrant colors a mix of hues, only to see it seized by an eagle's iron talons, snatched away as swiftly as a bullet propelled from a gun, you would tremble and lose your voice in sorrow.</p>
<p>We soon reached a small stone cave, in front of which stood a narrow reef, rising a hundred feet above the sea. Further ahead, a sheer cliff of rock blocked the surging waves. As we climbed two steps onto the stone platform, we felt an electric-like tremor pass through our bodies, akin to being startled by a sudden, loud sound in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I caught sight of a man sitting on a rock, staring at us.</p>
<p>The gaze he shot from his bloodshot eye sockets was like the flash of a cannon. His limbs were numb and motionless, as if he were one of the granite pillars amidst which he sat. His body remained rigid, as if he had turned to stone, with only his eyes moving slowly. After he glanced at us, deeply moving us, he shifted his gaze away, focusing on the vast ocean stretching before his feet. Despite the intense light glinting off the water's surface, he stared intently, as an eagle is said to gaze at the sun. He did not raise his eyes again. My dear uncle, imagine the withered top of an oak tree, stripped bare by time, its gnarled trunk still displaying its unique shape beside a desolate road—that is a true likeness of this man. His torso resembled that of a ruined Hercules, his face, like a suffering god of Olympus, scarred by age, coarse food, and the hardships of sea life, as if scorched by an electric current. I gazed at his rough, hairy hands, and I saw muscles like iron chains. Throughout his entire being, the signs of similarly endowed strength were revealed.</p>
<p>In a corner of the small stone cave, I glimpsed a large pile of moss and a rough stone shelf, naturally formed on the granite surface. On the shelf sat an earthenware pot, scattered with crumbs of round bread. My imagination—even when wandering among the hermits of the early Christian faith dwelling in the desert—had never conjured up such a sublime religious image, or such a terrible scene of penance. Surely you, my dear uncle, with your experience of penitents, have never seen such a noble heart in penance, a heart immersed in the waves of prayer, in the eternal silence of desperate prayer.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Usurious Loans</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>The other day, a newspaper reported that Xu Zhenyin, a Yancheng native living in a shack in western Shanghai, supported himself by pulling a rickshaw. His wife, Chen, finding her husband's meager earnings insufficient to make ends meet, secretly borrowed usurious loans from Chen Hongming. Now, Chen is pressuring her for repayment. Unable to repay the debt, she became despondent and, behind everyone's back, hanged herself. When her husband discovered her, she was already lifeless and cold. He immediately reported the matter to the police station, who summoned Chen Hongming for questioning.</p>
<p>Originally, there are a number of suicides due to economic pressure every day. There are many publicized relief methods in society. Regardless of the outcome, it is unnecessary to discuss too much. However, in this case, the deceased essentially died at the hands of the usurious lender. Here, I would like to briefly elaborate on the matter of "usurious loans." In my hometown, there is a popular folk song that roughly goes, "High-interest loans, usurious money, are man-eating beasts, swords that kill." These few words are enough to demonstrate the misery and severity caused by usurious loans. Many people have been forced to their deaths under this "super-economic exploitation." I remember that the government once explicitly prohibited "usurious loans," as they were no different from plunder. However, those who prohibit do so, while those struggling in hunger and cold still have no choice but to try this poisonous, bitter medicine.</p>
<p>Even in Shanghai, despite its thriving commerce and industry, usurious loans continue to grow insidiously in shantytowns and slums. Typically, borrowing one yuan at usurious interest incurs a daily interest of at least three copper coins, and often up to five, and the interest must be paid daily, otherwise, interest is added to interest. Calculated this way, the annual interest can be more than two or three times the principal. This kind of extortion is truly too cruel. To repay the loan, it is already difficult to even fill one's stomach, so how can one have the ability to repay it at once? Not repaying it, however, means that this long-term heavy interest is simply sucking the marrow from one's bones. Moreover, with constant hunger and cold pressing in, one must borrow new debts, and the debts accumulate more and more. The more debts there are, the more difficult it becomes to repay them. As a result, many people teetering on the brink of starvation become long-term beasts of burden for the bloodsuckers who lend usurious money. This inhuman plunder truly plays out countless tragedies and creates countless evils. The self-hanging of Xu and Chen is merely one of countless victims of usurious exploitation.</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Fang Yin</p>
<p>I love dusk. However, as dusk approaches, I become somewhat afraid. I fear its fleeting existence, I fear the night demon that follows it, I fear, I fear! I fear it symbolizes the setting of the sun, the arrival of an end.</p>
<p>A streak of crimson sunset hangs on the edge of the sky, and I suspect that it may hide pools of blood—not the blood of beasts, but the blood of lambs!—This blood records the brutal battles of the day.</p>
<p>I dream that perhaps some light will be revealed in the sunset clouds, but it will not be in the evening, but in the dawn that slowly slips out of the net of darkness after a night of battle.</p>
<p>Now, dusk is approaching again. I look at the sky, gazing at the fiery red sun sinking in the west.</p>
<p>Crows and sparrows noisily return to their nests in the forest, and the pastoral songs of the fields are scattered with melancholy. It is the return of flocks of sheep and oxen, a sigh after a day of fatigue.</p>
<p>Looking at the sky, looking at the dry fields, countless tanned faces are full of sorrow, countless backs weighed down by heavy burdens, and it is clear that not a trace of electricity can be found from the horizon...</p>
<p>The chimney stops its black smoke, and people with sallow faces drag their tired legs out of the factory, like flocks of sheep and oxen returning. A large group, a large group of people who spend all day suffocating under gas. They don't see the sun all day, only catching a glimpse of the sunset glow at dusk. However, before the fatigue of the day has even recovered, hearing the whistle howl like the call of a wolf, people must struggle stubbornly out of the darkness and crawl into that bottomless cave before dawn. …</p>
<p>I fear dusk, I love dusk, … I hope to find some tranquility in dusk, to breathe a sigh of relief before the dark night. …</p>
<p>But, in the corners of the city, linger that group; the crowds who never care whether it is dusk, night, or day? They reach out a dirty hand to beg for the mercy of others, using thousands of compliments to beg for scraps of food, hoping that the strength they can't sell and a small life can be temporarily prolonged. They constantly beg, regardless of day, night, or dusk, and then sleep in some indefinite street corner, clutching an emaciated stomach.</p>
<p>There is no tranquility here, but endless wailing and groaning!</p>
<p>I can't bear to hear the cries of mourning. I am horrified by the crimson sunset, and I fear such dusk. But, I need to find a moment of tranquility in between.</p>
<p>I once walked from the distant desert to the edge of the sea with a wounded heart. I begged like a beggar, prolonging this half-dead life. I understand myself better than anyone else, I understand that I need to survive.</p>
<p>The devil grabs me with his ferocious claws, and he wants to drive me behind those who die old and die young, urging me to fall from dusk into the black night like a dead city.</p>
<p>However, I don't want to sink, I don't want to die, I still have to struggle, from this dusk to that dusk. I know: before dusk is day, and after night is dawn. But, but my age has not yet reached the time of twilight, I have to break free from this claw, and with a wounded body, pass one dusk after another,</p>
<p>Yes, I once received a gentle caress in the dusk, a sea breeze awakened me from my coma, but as soon as the dusk disappeared, the night demon came to hunt me down again. I will continue to seize the second dawn</p>
<p>The evening breeze lifted the corners of my clothes, and the sun gradually sank between the mountains. I chased, I ran, I sprinted, I wanted to save the swallowed sun. But I fell in the mountain col, I did not retrieve our sun, I was injured, and slowly dragged my injured body, and climbed up again in the rugged mountains.</p>
<p>From then on, I was even more afraid of dusk like this.</p>
<p>However, when I am so tired from daytime work that I feel as weak as if I am dying, I feel that dusk is astringent, tranquil, and lovely. Therefore, I have to love dusk, but I am also afraid of dusk...</p>
<h3>Painting Interests</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>There are two ways to look at paintings. Small pieces such as cartoons and title page illustrations can only be enjoyed in private, early in the morning or late at night, or when waking up before bed. In addition to looking at these kinds of small paintings, there is also the fun of reading them. They are not just for sensory satisfaction. Large hanging scrolls, especially the screen paintings in Chinese painting, can only be hung in a splendidly decorated reception room to achieve harmony in mood. But these things are only for viewing and playing, and there is no fun in reading them. Although the ancients once praised Wang Wei's paintings as having poetry in them, this was perhaps because Wang Wei's paintings were in harmony with the life mood of people in that era. In the modern era of steamboats, trains, and Western suits and leather shoes, that kind of ancient life mood is of course difficult to exist in our lives.</p>
<p>However, the style of Chinese paintings created by contemporary painters is completely different from modern life. The background must be mountains and forests, misty rain, flowing water and small bridges, and the characters must be high-ranking, wide-robed reclusive farmers and woodcutters. The ladies must have slender heads and moth eyebrows, with narrow shoulders and slender waists. It is truly strange to the extreme that modern people create paintings with ancient moods. Some people say that the imitative nature of Chinese people is higher than their creative nature, or is this what it means? If someone were to say that it is precisely this that can express the spirit and thoughts of Eastern people, then one can't help but feel "unbelievable."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I can't help but praise Mr. Feng Zikai's paintings. He uses Chinese brushstrokes, lines, and emotions to depict the life mood of modern Chinese people. Although only</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>they are small pieces, their artistic expressive function is not comparable to those "Chinese paintings."</p>
<p>Going to art exhibitions held by groups, organizations, or individuals, I also feel that it is a kind of murder of my emotions. Seeing some swollen-looking human figures, I feel a burst of discomfort in my heart. The performance of art certainly has elements of exaggeration and emphasis, but it cannot be excessive. Although these figure paintings come from the West, I can't bear to deceive myself and say that these are beautiful works of art. The price tag in one corner of the painting is also quite difficult to look at. Since they want to fill their stomachs with paintings, they should just say that they are selling paintings. Why must they beautify it by calling it an art exhibition? I am not ridiculing that it is a shameful and lowly thing for painters to sell paintings for money. The modern way of life is originally trending towards the extremes of commodification and complexity. This cannot but make people think of the "painting beggars" on the streets of Paris. They have nothing outside their bodies, and only use a few crude chalk pencils to write out their works on the smooth road, asking passers-by for some alms. Although this way of selling paintings is somewhat pitiful, their straightforwardness and unrestrainedness are worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Playing the zither, playing chess, calligraphy, and painting were everyday activities for scholars of previous generations, and those who could not play the zither, play chess, write, or paint could never be ranked among talented and elegant people. As for using these pastimes to advance in society, there is naturally another way of saying it. Looking at contemporary scholar-painters, how many can write and paint, and paint and write? However, this cannot be said to be evidence that modern people are inferior to people in the past. On the contrary, from a scientific point of view, it is a progressive expression of modern art. Mechanical civilization has given rise to a social mode of production that must adopt a division of labor; and contemporary literary painters can naturally only devote themselves to their respective arts for the rest of their lives. And to say that the productions of painters who cannot write are far inferior to the ancients is absolutely untenable. Naturally, the Chinese people's emphasis on the ancient and disregard for the modern is not unique to art. The ancient must be good, and the modern must be bad. It has become the criterion for criticism. How many collectors are arrogant and unyielding, and the value of ancient paintings and engravings is incalculable. However, I believe that there are few who value their precious antiques entirely for the sake of artistic interest, or who attempt to extract the social significance contained in ancient paintings and engravings. What is the pleasure of their craze for ancient paintings? It is because these are things from previous generations. That contemporary Chinese painters must painstakingly take ancient methods as the standard, in addition to their lack of creativity and strength, this may be one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Some people say that art in the future will inevitably return to the hands of the masses and become something of their own. This statement is certainly not wrong, but I think this may also be a matter for future generations. The lives, education, and ideals of the masses are still far apart. The masses of today can never find their own interests in swollen-looking human figure paintings and paintings of reclusive scholars in mountains and forests; and artists with artistic education will never bother to appreciate comic strips such as Hundred Beauties Pictures or Swordsmen Tales. What the public needs are things like this! Theorists who shout high-pitched theories are actually a bit too anxious.</p>
<p>The current popularity of cartoon production cannot be said to be not because it can capture the interests of a part of the public. This phenomenon is worth rejoicing. Using Chinese brushstrokes, emotions, and lines to depict the life mood of modern Chinese people is what we hope our painters will work hard to do.</p>
<h3>Spending the Night in a Desolate Village</h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>I had no planned itinerary for this journey, but due to an urgent matter, I was heading to Changsha. However, upon inquiring, there were no convenient boats heading east lately, so I boarded a gravel boat headed for Changsha.</p>
<p>Riding a gravel boat also has a tradition: as long as you are from the same hometown, they not only absolutely won't charge you for the boat fare and drinks, but they will also provide meals for the passengers. However, they don't run boats very often, so it is very rare to catch their boat.</p>
<p>In the morning breeze, carrying my only suitcase! And bag, I hurriedly got off the boat, and the boat slowly left the wharf. Because the hull was too heavy, the voyage was very slow. As someone with worries on my mind, I felt really anxious sitting inside, but what was the use of being anxious? The boat won't move faster. There was no other way, so I had to look at the scenery of the lake or chat with the people on the boat; in this way, my uneasy heart calmed down.</p>
<p>"Today the wind is a favorable wind, but the weather is not clear," the boat owner squatted by the helm, clamped down on the rudder, one hand resting on the oar stern, saying very serenely.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it will be after dusk when we arrive at Weisha!" A shop assistant leaned against the mast, watching the milky white gossamer flying in the sky.</p>
<p>Lunch was served on the boat. The meal on the boat was extremely simple: a bowl of pickled vegetables, tofu, bean sprouts, and salted fish, but it still had a special flavor, and watching them eat so voraciously was quite interesting.</p>
<p>"How far is the town from the pier, and is there a place to eat there?" After finishing my meal, I suddenly thought that if the boat arrived late, I wouldn't have a place to stay. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Liu Zongyuan's "Debate on the Analects" (1): Someone asked, "Scholars praise the Analects, saying it was recorded by Confucius' disciples. Is this credible?" I say, "Not so." Confucius' disciple Zeng Shen was the youngest, 46 years younger than Confucius. Zeng died in old age. This book records Zeng's death, so it is far removed from Confucius. When Zeng died, almost none of Confucius' disciples survived. I believe it was written by Zeng's disciples. Why? Moreover, this book always refers to disciples by their given names, but Zeng alone is referred to as Zi. From this, it can be said that it is not a disciple's record. Then why is You referred to as Zi? I say, "When Confucius died, the disciples regarded You as similar to the master, and they stood and took him as their teacher. Later, unable to answer the disciples' questions, he scolded them and withdrew. So, he once had the title of teacher. Now, the record only states that Zeng died last. Therefore, I know that it was written by the followers of Zichun of Lezheng, or Confucius' disciples vaguely recorded his words, but the one who eventually completed the book was Zeng's disciple.</p>

<p>Opening "Dream of the Red Chamber - Qingwen"</p>
<p>Outside the gauze window, the moonlight is faint. It shines alone on Qingwen's ice and snow skin. Her face is like a lotus just emerging from the water. Her waist is woven like willows, graceful and charming. She is intelligent, peerless, and full of elegance. Such a lovely person is rare in this world. It's a pity that her words are sharp and her heart is too impetuous, often hurting the young servants. Master Bao loves her more than Qiuhun and the others. With a smile, he tears up a thousand taels worth of fan. Her sick body can barely support her, yet she tirelessly weaves and mends the golden-threaded brocade all night. Helplessly, she has formed a deep and bitter feud. Someone secretly schemes against her. Lady Wang listens to gossip and investigates the matter with great anger. She says, "Your eyebrows and eyes are just like Miss Lin's. You are a sick Xishi suitable for living in the Huansha Creek. From now on, I will remove you from the Yi Hong Courtyard. No fox spirits are allowed to linger here." Holding back her grievances, she leaves, sick and resentful, returning home with unyielding illness. The affectionate young master knocks on the wooden door, regretting his initial poor judgment. Empty fame has misled him, causing him to suffer. It's like a cry of the "He Manyi" tune. She bites off her tender fingers to repay his love. Her fragrant soul departs from the human world, summoned by the Rong Immortal to the Jade Pond. She first leaves the bitter sea, awaiting the arrival of Xiangfei.</p>

<p>Master Zhuangzi has already been buried. He understands the mystery of life and death. He transforms into a master and servant to test people. Once reunited, they will have a hundred-year bond. Instantly, the man feels a heart-wrenching pain as if dead. The soul-returning incense is not originally from China. Even without completing the seven cycles of human brains, it's better than a miraculous elixir for instant salvation. With a resolute heart, he sharpens a pure steel axe, willing to exert all his strength. With scattered sparks, he smashes open the coffin. Zhuang Zhou sits up and adjusts his clothes. He is ashamed and resentful, with nowhere to hide, his soul startled and frightened. Zhuangzi repeatedly asks, tilting his head, "Why did you open the coffin and split my head? What kindness did he show you, what grievance did I cause you? The new and old wives are all the same. Don't laugh at the foolish woman fanning the grave. How can an outsider be better than someone involved?" Both ashamed, anxious, and speechless, she hangs herself from the beam. Immediately, funeral arrangements are made. This love affair comes to an end. Suddenly, he has no worries inwardly, free to roam the four seas like an unmoored boat, seeking pleasure and joy every day.</p>

<p>Li Pingqian's new script, "Love Letter," has fresh and unique insights into love between men and women, with a particularly tortuous and moving story.</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan's new film, "Big Family," directed in the sweltering heat, has been completely finished. Everyone who saw the preview said they were satisfied. The film will soon have a "meet and greet" with the audience on the silver screen.</p>
<p>Hu Die has returned from her European tour and has been working at the film studio for a long time, filming the unfinished scenes of "Night Fragrance."

<p>Young Master Sun Min, in "Big Family," spends money like water, buying two or three hundred dollars worth of dance tickets every night to give to the dancers, which was criticized by Xie Yunqing as being a big fool. It is truly a dream of a dance hall that lasts ten years, earning only a name for being a fool who dies abroad.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Wang Xianzai is a master of villainous roles. He always tricks others, but he has never been tricked himself. However, this time it's a bit different. In "Big Family," he is the elder brother, tricked by Wang Jiting and Yan Yuexian, yet he is still complacent. In these times, it's really not easy to be a person.</p>
<p>Xuan Jinglin and Wang Xianzai's divine performance in "Daughter's Sutra," one complementing the other, has been praised by everyone. Now, in "Big Family," they are once again an old married couple, and their performance is truly a perfect match, deeply convincing.</p>

<p>Xu Xingzhi is also working hard during the hot season, writing poetry and articles, and translating. Recently, he has also participated in the editing of the Dianshi Bi-monthly Pictorial, which seems even busier. However, he also pays attention to his health, often practicing Tai Chi in the room in front of the mirror to correct his posture.</p>
<p>Set designer Zhang Yunqiao paints extremely quickly and is known as the "seven-step prodigy." Recently, the Dianshi Pictorial asked him to make five quick sketches of the actors of "Goddess of Freedom," and he submitted them in no time. Zijan "completed a poem in seven steps," Yunqiao is "completing a book in three minutes."</p>
<h3>Women of Tibet</h3>
<p>Following the central government's earnest concern for the people's attention, this vast land that belongs to China's territory and has always been regarded as two worlds, Tibet, is now less mysterious in people's minds than before. In fact, Tibet's content is extremely interesting and mysterious. Women, in particular, can reveal the characteristics of a place. The women of Tibet are not what ordinary people can see and understand. Yueming Company is currently rushing to produce a Tibetan film, with exterior scenes filmed entirely on location in Tibet. Inside, not only can we get a glimpse of the true appearance of everything in Tibet's customs and scenery, but the women of Tibet also reveal their unique postures on the screen. When this film is released in the future, a new impression of women will be added to the minds of ordinary people.</p>

<h3>Japanese Temple Architecture (3)</h3>
<p>— Ito Chuta (Author), Zhang Guangzheng (Translator)</p>
<p>Buddhist Temple Architecture</p>
<p>Japanese Buddhist temple architecture is completely different from shrine architecture. Shrine architecture is purely an original creation of ancient Japan; Buddhist temple architecture is the Japanization of styles transmitted from China. The form of Chinese Buddhist temple halls originally followed the model of the highly developed palace architecture of ancient China. In China, there was no special style called Buddhist temple architecture. Therefore, the root of Japanese Buddhist temple architecture is Chinese palaces.</p>
<p>Moreover, nearly 1,400 years have passed since Buddhism was introduced to Japan. The Japanese people, accustomed to the Chinese-style Buddhist temple architecture, gradually developed a deep sense of intimacy with it, and now have reached a level of love and cannot be separated from it. Therefore, it is only natural that current Buddhist temple architecture almost entirely follows the old model. However, from a purely theoretical perspective, Buddhist temple architecture cannot be determined to necessarily follow the current Chinese-style form. This is very different from the reason why shrines cannot but absolutely adhere to ancient forms.</p>
<p>Shrines are the palaces where the spirits of the Japanese imperial ancestors reside, so their architecture must be based on the style of ancient times. However, Buddhist temples are the halls where the founders of Buddhism and all the Buddhas reside, so it would not be strange to imitate India, or create unique halls and pagodas based on inspiration from Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p>In recent years, the nature of Buddhist temples has gradually become that of public buildings. They are used for preaching and funerals, or for lectures on Dharma affairs, or for religious affairs and public undertakings, and for various other purposes. To adapt to this, their architecture will naturally undergo a fate of change. In short, it cannot be determined that Buddhist temple architecture will permanently maintain its ancient style. Recently, Buddhist temples of new styles are being built everywhere. We don't need to be too surprised by this.</p>
<h3>From Architectural Art to the Temples of Greece (6)</h3>
<p>— Sun Zongwen</p>
<p>—The Most Glorious Page in the History of World Architecture—</p>
<p>In addition to contributing their capital art to the world, the Greeks also had great research on the design of columns; they made many contributions to architectural design in later generations. Therefore, we also deserve to discuss it. Its design features have the following points:</p>
<p>1. The design of columns and beams is absolutely centrally substantial.</p>
<p>2. The arrangement of the columns is whole and integrated, not fragmented and disordered.</p>
<p>3. The selection of materials has special advantages; because they can know the properties of various materials and other experiences, the building can increase its durability.</p>
<p>4. At that time, also because of the research on the earth's gravity, the size of the building was a certain rule, especially the design of beams and columns, so there was no risk of fracture or other. This point can increase the safety of the building and is one of the greatest contributions at that time.</p>
<p>5. The design of beams and columns applies the law of Optical Corrections, which is described below:</p>
<p>Because we see an extremely long straight line, the two ends of the line always feel bent upward. And if you look at a slightly curved horizontal line, it will sink its very straightness; therefore, based on this reason, when designing a horizontal beam, the Greeks did not draw a straight line but slightly curved it. Similarly, because we always become curved when we look at a straight line, the Greeks also drew longitudinal curved lines when making straight columns; therefore, the columns expand to the left and right sides. These two points cannot be said to be a great contribution of the Greeks to architectural design. From this, we can see that the superior talent of the Greeks can be said to be fully utilized without any regret.</p>
<p>The Greeks also designed the surrounding columns of the temple building according to the above-mentioned principles, the principle of visual correction, so the diameters of the leftmost and rightmost two columns on the front are slightly larger, and their distance to the adjacent one and the one behind is slightly shorter; therefore, people's eyes do not feel monotonous; because the back of the column is not a wall but the sky; if the diameter of the column is not larger, then people's eyes will feel too monotonous! Similarly, according to this principle, the top of any text written on the building is the largest, and gradually shrinks downward; the reason is that when people stand in front and look up, they always feel that the words on the top are smaller than those on the bottom. In order to correct this visual error, the Greeks studied that the words on the top should be larger than those on the bottom.</p>
<h3>Architectural History (3)</h3>
<p>— Buren</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, architectural art was developing in most European countries, and each country had its own characteristics. In England, we can roughly divide the "Gothic" period into:</p>
<p>Early English style – 13th century.</p>
<p>Decorated style – 14th century.</p>
<p>Perpendicular style – 15th century.</p>
<p>By the 16th century, "Gothic" gradually declined, and it was replaced by the architectural style called "Tudor". "Tudor style" contains the flavor of ancient Roman architecture, and thus produced the architecture of the early Renaissance.</p>
<p>The great Renaissance that occurred in Italy in the 15th century produced one result among many results: Italian architects carefully studied the buildings of ancient Rome, and thus designed many fresh and beautiful ancient-style new patterns. England, because of its distance, still adopted the old architectural style and was not affected by the new patterns after Italy and its neighbors had abolished "Gothic". Of course, the craze of the Renaissance finally swept to England, but this was not directly sandwiched, but came through France and the Netherlands, so the early British Renaissance buildings were mostly a strange mixture, half "Gothic" or "Tudor", half Italian, and a bit Dutch, or French, or German.</p>
<p>The change of style is mostly first discovered in small programs about decoration; these new designs are first tested on house decorations, metal work, colored decorations, paintings, and things like music stands and tombs, and then are adopted by practical buildings. The change is slow and uneven. Sometimes it takes a long time to reach remote areas, as long as fifty years.</p>
<p>During the reign of Elizabeth and James I, the so-called early Renaissance architectural style was prevalent throughout England. After the famous architect Inigo Jones returned from studying Italian buildings to the court of Charles I, English architecture began to lean towards a new style that was relatively unmixed and more closely resembled the works of the Romans and their skilled descendants. Jones certainly made many patterns and designs, but due to the obstruction of the civil war, not many buildings were actually built. His most famous work—the Banquet Hall in "Whitehall"—is only a small part of the grand palace he intended to build for Charles I.</p>
<p>The second famous British architect was Sir Christopher Wren. He had never been to Italy, but when he went to Paris to visit Louis XVI's newly built palace, he met many Italian and French architects.</p>
<p>What Wren brought back were certainly Italian and French architectural plans, but these plans all contained his own various creative plans. He was indeed called the creator of "Anglo-Classic Style" architecture. The reconstruction of London houses after the "Great Fire" gave him a chance to show his skills. "St. Paul's" and many other local churches still exist today, which are symbols of his talent. He also built Hampton Court, Greenwich Hospital, Chelsea Hospital, and many beautiful private residences, both in towns and in the countryside. In fact, in the history of British architecture, Wren's achievements are greater than any other architect, whether before or after; and, if the houses in London had been completely rebuilt according to his plan after the "Great Fire", then the splendor of the British capital could have defeated the world.</p>
<p>After Wren, straight through the 18th century, England produced many good architects, each with their own slightly special plans, but all of them were based on the great classical style that Wren first created and anglicized.</p>
<p>In the early 19th century, the new discoveries, new identifications, and new collapses of the ruins of ancient Greece and ancient Rome made people's thoughts return to the true origins of classical architecture, and the result was "Classical Revleal". The buildings produced from this—such as St Geotoes Hallid in Liverpool—are sufficiently noble and magnificent, but not entirely suitable for the interests of the British people.</p>
