<h3 id="c24">廣田外交與中日關係 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>日外長廣田弘毅氏上臺以來。卽倡爲「道義外交」「睦隣政策」。對華對美。以及英蘇諸國。均有化干戈爲玉帛之表示。前日第六十七通常議會開幕。廣田氏演說外交方針。又重申此意旨。考其實際。對英美各國。莫不表示好感。着重爼豆折衝。冀圖遠東時局之漸向安定。惟其間尤值得吾人充分注意者。厥爲中日關係。廣田氏認爲現已逐漸好轉。並期待將來之能長遠繼續。於中日諒解尤一再致意。由此更可窺知日本外交意旨之所在矣。</p>
<p>夫中日兩國在地理上。在近六十年來之歷史關係上。皆有不可分離之聯繫性。此種聯繫。洵屬綜錯複雜較諸歐洲諸國殆有過之是以孫中山先生倡導大亞細亞主義。而日本先進諸賢如桂太郎等亦崇而信之。惟孫先生遺教之所昭示。與夫今日中國之所奉行。最重要之一點。端在我中國民族之獨立自由。及解除種種之無理束縛也。是中日良善關係之建立。第一在民族利益之互相尊重。換言之。卽不損我國家之獨立自由。而言親善是也。第二在和平前途之積極貢獻。我國尤願盡其最大努力。以謀中日關係之改正。今後何如。須視日本之誠意以定之耳。</p>
<p>廣田氏之所謂道義外交。誠於中日間和平友善關係有相當貢獻。去年以來。亦有若干進步。假使日本能本此意繼續努力。不侵我國民族利益。不碍我國之獨立自由。則我國政府及民衆當不惜與之誠意携手。共同維護遠東和平也。如法德兩國。論歷史淵源。積恨已深。解釋非易。而法國竟能保持大國襟度靜待薩爾人民投票結果。任國聯之善意裁决。歐洲動搖之局。遂得一時之穩定法德對立。亦從而和緩。中日間雖亦有極不平之積憾。然以德法較。尙未至如是之深。改善可能。或者過之。</p>
<p>且歐洲和平之局已漸次奠定。法意爭覇次第緩和。實際利害且得調解之道矣。影響所及。中歐糾紛及北非競爭。莫不現一綫曙光。重建國際友好關係。至於海軍軍縮會議。在預備會議中。因英美日三國各本自己主張。堅持其根本原則。作不退轉之提示。致陷軍縮會議於僵局。本年正式會議之前途。固未可樂觀。然歐洲局勢旣趨安定。英美諒解可能。驟爾增大。太平洋上浮動之暗雲惟日見其稀薄耳。所謂國際危機云者。縱未必一槪掃除。而相當程度之减少。必然之勢也。此積動向。於太平洋沿岸諸國。關係至切。於中日間貢獻尤爲鉅大。</p>
<p>日本外交動向。果能如廣田氏之所期待。又無損我國民族利益。繼以和平之努力。則我國當秉其素昔維護和平之初心。爲國際友善盡其最大之努力。而我中國又爲太平洋上主要國家之一。更當披瀝其誠信與日本相見。爲外交上之折衝。使海上暗雲因而减少。使遠東國際關係因而改善。消除所謂危機而向世界和平之途邁進。其關鍵亦唯在日本而已。</p>

<p>（東京）衆議院會議於二十三日午後一時十五分開會、傍聽席上超過定額、情形至爲熱烈、今日仍繼續對國務大臣之演說行使質問、首由山口義一氏在滿塲喝彩聲中登台、謂對現內閣之綱紀問題須提出質問、於是發言如左——</p>
<p>前次齊藤內閣爲綱紀問題而崩潰、現內閣又發生因此而崩潰之情形、查此項事態、頗於國家威信上有關、故對於綱紀問題、現在當行使質疑、據傳聞則謂岡田內閣對於入閣諸人之素性與品行、業經在事前加以檢討、然其內閣中仍不無附有疑問符號之閣員在內、此事在岡田內閣應負有二重之責任、吾人現向床次遞相提出質問如下、</p>
<p>床次氏曾於昭和三年秋季旅行中國時、關於民政當與對華政策所見不同、並發表聲明在案、查當時田中內閣之對華、採取强硬政策、厠張學良則於此時煽惑排日運動、此時床次氏倘與田中內閣意見相同、當不致與張學良會見、床次氏當時之行動、至少亦係約定緩和日本之對華强硬政策也、</p>
<p>床次遞相答辯如左——</p>
<p>山口君之親密、余當表示謝意、但其言論諸多假設、余之旅行中國、確於昭和三年十二月、因當時兩國間懸案諸多遲滯、爲實地觀察起見、乃有此行自華南而赴瀋陽、且與張學良相晤、歸國後余所發表之意見、有請承認南京政府、並將濟南之出兵撤回、上項主張、並與田中內閣懇談、當承同意、余之意見、對於君國可謂盡矣、至今尙信之、擁有此項忠君報國心之余、豈能爲金錢所惑、大凡知其人爲何許人、然後方能評論、請勿妄談可也、至於所謂靑年將校同志會發出任何印刷品之件、事有所聞而未見其物、余固不必與匿其姓名者爲對手、倘有與余爲對手者、請提出姓名而來，並望來者預先覺悟爲要耳、此項問題、乃犬養內閣成立當時以來所暴露之件、余實不願爲之辯解、縱令加以明釋興否、而信者信之、不信者依然不信、山口君所謂別有風說尙不在內、余則希望勿存客氣、盡量發表可也、至於糊亂瞎話之種種謠傳、則請勿提至議會爲好、</p>
<p>床次遞相以上項諄諄教誨之態度、在民政黨之喝彩聲中悠然降台後、山口氏乃卽再行登台追加議論如左、</p>
<p>發出印刷品者爲陸軍省之官吏陸軍少佐、因此爲表示廉潔起見、應要求取消、或訴之以損害名譽罪、否則不能掃除國民之疑惑也、</p>
<p>床次遞相答如左、</p>
<p>余之答辯、頃已盡情言之、表示潔白之手段、或應如山口君所談、亦未可知、但是否採取、卻屬余之自由、</p>

<p>▲籌委會函復陶孟和等</p>
<p>▲擇要說明未嘗涉茍且</p>
<p>（中央社二十三日南京電）關於倫敦中國藝展事平學術界陶孟和等、對於選擇及保險等問題、曾發表意見、頃籌委會復陶等函、略謂頃從一月二十日大公報得閱先生等對倫敦藝展宣言主張諸事應愼重、用意甚是、惟實際情形或未盡悉、因擇要說明如次、（一）緣起、此事原發動於英國學術界人士聯合英皇家藝術學院向我國正式提議以爲中國藝術其超越日常物質生活之精神、對西方人民實具有針對之激刺性、近數年間、意法等國在倫敦展覽藝術、英與各該國間之關係、往往突現增進中國爲東方文化之祖、茍能在倫敦興行國際展覽、其收效必大、我政府在此種考慮下、遂予以允許、且爲愼重起見、要求英政府聯合主持、英已正式聲明合作、（二）决定的經過、此次藝展在政府接受英建議前首先徵求故博院理事會意見、該院决議贊同其原則後、汪蔣諸公亦先後有文電主張、嗣經陸續提請行政院曁中政會、議决、（三）安全問題、此項問題亦曾一再提付故博院理事會討論、該會以爲注重切實的保障、並不拘泥保險、後本會以茲事重大、呈政院核定政院議决、應謀切實保障安全辦法、院議理由、因保險須費大宗保險費、並不能增加物品安全、政府重視物品本身之安全、本會照此决定會鄭重電英謂、如別無保障安全之切實辦法、此事或終至罷議、因此爲預防海盜及其他意外起見、英正式照會願派軍艦護送裝運展品之郵船、爲减少入口時困難及意外事故起見、英方並擬於物品到英時、不在海關查騐、而在展覽塲所會同中國代表騐看、此外英外部表示、對於其他一切安全事項、願盡力協助、詳細辦法、已擬定將另發表、（四）展品選擇權、展品之初選由中國方面辦理英方委員於初選後得提出主張、但彼所主張、自非經中國方面同意不能生效、中國方面、對於認爲不能出國之件、自可不予出國、故展品選擇之最終選定權、實屬於籌委會、（五）展品離國期間、此次展品出國計往返中途中及在英展覽所需時間、共計當不過十個月左右、外間以爲需時一年半或兩年者、並非事實、（六）出國展品數量與質素、此次所擬選之故宮古物以故宮古物館存滬古物之極小一部份爲限、連同此外徵求之品、綜共不過千五百件而已、諸凡歷史上經專門委員會、認有特殊價値之國寳、均不出國、此層已經故宮理事會及本會一再議决、並已正式告知英方委員、綜之、政府及本會處理此事、實未嘗稍涉荀且云云、</p>

<p>徐悲鴻、對於中英藝專發表感言云、上海俗話、稱做不道地、不着寳、謂之曰拆洋爛污、但恒指個人行動、即法人行動、類拆爛污者亦希、獨如中英藝展將國寳還送赴英、而不保險、誠心拆個大爛污者、蓋無先例、中國態度篤信不疑、落落大方、眞是天才之創造、到底與上海賣茶葉湖絲的出口商人不同、</p>
<p>據我所知、英國鑒別東方文物權威者、爲名詩人平陽LanrenceBengan今爲大英博物院主要保管委員之一、又葉此Yetts'精於銅器、現爲倫敦大學教授、皆未與聞其事、而被派來華者、類皆商人之流、實令人大啓疑竇、</p>
<p>原來人家請我們送東西去陳列、在我們目的爲宣揚文化、我不承認、因爲中國古文明、乃世界公認、用不着宣傳、英國所要的一八○○年以前之物、若其意若曰、中國自一八○○年後即無文化、現代更無文化、用不着人家來選、讓人家來選、即不啻宣告自己國內即無一識者、徧是來選東西的人、並不是那裏的著名專家、其意何在、而我方只信他一塊大英照會、聽人家處置、寄運英保險亦無之、奇談、奇談、</p>
<p>我忝爲專委之一、自然我向來不管人家聞事、我又目擊此事之不妙、而政府又鄭重其事、已予人以諾言、我以現代人的資格、不能不喚起人的注意、卻價値千元的東西、亦必保險、並且要商量出一個完備手續、免萬一之洋爛污、而我更希望賢明之政府、與駐英之大外交家、趁中國古物尙未起運以前、得一協定、要求英國到明年也到中國來開一英國美術展覽會、陳列三四百件繪畫雕刊之類、我們并且聲明要一八○○年以後的東西、從Conrtable　Tunuer起直到現代、我們並非不能選、但由他們自己選、我們很虛心的向英國文化請教、無一絲半毫娘奶頭作用的、易兄培基李兄宗侗往矣、當時請他們來做古宮博物院長、秘書長時、也以爲他們靠得住的很、必想不到拆這麼大的爛污、可以說他們起先便有組織的、我們當局、類多君子、但君子可欺以其方、那些洋商、還了得起、別呌易先培基等嗤笑、那些寃桶、等樣的損失國寳、却完全白送、自己也沒有享受得着、哼、哼、</p>

<p>▲上年度有中小學十所</p>
<p>▲本年內擬再增辦三校</p>
<p>公共租界工部局之教育事務中、計現在有局立之學校十六校、而私立學校之受工部局補助金者有一百五十九校、主管教育者、有教育委員會及教育處、</p>
<p>▲擬定華人教育方針　一九三一年教育委員會建議推廣華人教育、計畫自該年起、至一九三八年、每年開辦小學兩所、又於一九三四年成立女中學共兩校、其已成立之各公學、則完全改爲中學、至關於外僑方面、則不增新校、只對已有各校、酌予改進校舍設備、同時對私立學校之辦理滿意者、予以補助金、</p>
<p>▲一九三五擬增三校　惟查此項計畫、確已經董事會及納稅人會採納原則、尙多含試騐性質、因决定俟一九三四年年終、對於未完之建築計畫、予以復議、及上年財政困難、遂將增設小學一事、暫爲從緩、斯時又經人建議、將辦理學校之欵、移以擴充補助金、旋由教育委員會議决、維持現行方針、一方面就財力所及、增辦學校、一方面仍照舊發放補助金、並擬議於一九三五年內、增設華童男女小學兩所、及第二女子中學一所、</p>
<p>▲女子中學新校完成　查一九三○年初、華人學校僅六校、學生僅二三九一名、目前則學校有十所、學生五千八百十五人、自一九二八年格致公學校舍完成後、各中學復就、舊校舍加以增改、以容納增多之學生、至上年又於新加坡路爲女子中學建一三層樓之新式校舍、本年二月完成啓用、</p>
<p>▲五處小學最近槪况　一九二八年以前、工部局未辦小學、僅於各公學內附有小學班、是年乃創辦小學兩所、今則已有五校、一爲愛而近路小學、一九二八年租屋開辦、一九三○年移於華童公學舊址、今有學生六○八名、一爲荊州路小學、此校亦於一九二八年購屋於滙山路開辦、一九三三年在荊州路建新校舍、可容學生七百名、運動塲與聶中丞公學合用、一爲新閘路小學、一九三○年先在愛文義路開辦、旋自建新校舍、學生由五百餘名增至七二五名、一爲華德路小學、一九三二年租屋修改後開辦、學生初僅二四二名、現增至七三一名、一爲滙山路小學、此校現只收女生、男生則送往荊州路、此校現有學生四百名</p>
<p>▲創辦簡易補習學校　工部局在短期間內、雖未能充分實行原定計畫、然已增設女中一所、小學五所、將來計畫之推行如何、視財政之狀况而定、爲補救工商子弟之失學者起見、特於上年十月、在荊州路小學內創辦一補習夜校、收學生二百六十餘名、年齡均在十四至二十之間、課程包括讀書·作文·算術·及公民與衛生常識、每季只收學費大洋五角、該校學生就學極爲踴躍、亦可見此類學校實爲急需、</p>
<p>▲學童健康專員檢查　上年局立各校、健康良好、學生雖有患傳染病者、然校中未致傳播、一九三三年年終、衛生處擬具一計畫、實行檢查學生體格、旋即由小學一校着手試辦、發現目疾及皮膚病頗多、旋由董事會准撥欵兩萬四千餘元、並任命學校衛生專員一員、檢查學童身體、對於有疾者、予以適當之救治、先京各華童小學試辦</p>
<p>▲補助學校一四五所　工部局自一九三一年决定補助私立學校辦法、受補助之學校、除在教學上應有滿意之成績外、並須遵率衛生處所定之條件、至於建築費、則今後不再撥助、惟因衛生等需要、有須修改房屋者、仍可予以考慮、計一九三四年、華人私立學校受工部局補助者、凡中學二十四校、小學一百二十一校、共一百四十五校、有學生三一·二二二名、補助金之總額、爲十八萬八千九百五十元、</p>
<p>▲外童學校建造新屋　據教育處長之報告、地豐路之西區西童公學校舍、於上年一月完成、可容學生四百五十名、又渶璧禮女公學、於年底亦可完工、可容學生五百名、至外僑私立學校、受工部局補助者有十四校、共有學生五千四百餘名、</p>

<h3 id="c256">河下米市績好角許 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源轉多、共到五十餘號、（貨共九千餘石）銷塲本街轉爽、且包胃如靑島帮續辦六七百包、故市色向上、形勢帶緊、厚粳及晚稻各好角許、惟大結束期近似乎難再有重大變化也、杜尖缺貨數朝、今特獨俏、洋尖仍無市、陰變元則猶平定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到貨二十餘號、市上各色去胃略形起色、白粳略有交易、薄稻稍化、餘貨淸淡、市價白粳小角許、變元及各尖疲去數分、薄稻無甚上落、</p>
<h3 id="c257">客秈貶價出銷洋米定局 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、客化已呆、統市內地只辦西貢碎米五百包、因內地各帮都以年底結束、去胃漸淡、惟本街仍有問津、成交一號西貢一千多包外、又有期碎米八百噸之交易、市面暫居平站之局、因產價久居挺俏、貨主心思甚堅、雖存到兩多、仍不肯賤價脫手、市面在年內或可立定、惟客秈以行販急求結束、而去胃本客均淡、前日只開七八百包、昨日貨主貶價求售、始得開出二千六百包、行情比之前市較小五分至一角不等、河下米已定二十八日停市、故目下洋客秈本街去胃或可熱鬧云、</p>
<h3 id="c258">雜糧市塲已在結束 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>昨日雜糧市塲交易稀少、大勢局部已在結束、黃豆市先因銷塲不動、市氣疲軟、午後聞連電猛漲、人心略轉好、但其交易仍見寥寥、統市計廠家辦去歸德豆六百包、價爲三元九角、及大連四平街豆二車、價爲四元二角半、又大粒一車、價開四元三角、本街去漢口乍豆七百包、價爲三元七角七及六角七、又去大連范家屯豆三百餘包、價爲四元四角、</p>

<p>昨日糖市、趨勢更疲、成交寥寥，公會划盤二四粗砂白以及荷赤等均僅叫價一無應交、前到廣東粗砂白、昨繼續標賣、原額爲二千四百六十包、價爲十八元三角、又降二角、結果衹成交七十包、其疲可知、潮靑續開二三一百包、尙無過甚上落、黃崗靑爲十元一二角、隆靑江九元八角</p>

<p>湘蓮近以申市無大宗去胃、迄無轉振之機、但茲據漢市函訊、因產區存底已薄、雖値大結束之期在邇、銷路反見活動、故辦價轉升七八角、同時產區亦漲六角、此間行盤亦稍帶緊、預料結束後之首盤、當有回好之可能、</p>

<p>黑鐵皮近來市面極覺不振、雖執貨者竭力設法招徠、無奈環境不良、頗有走銷乏術之槪、但資本富裕之搪磁廠、因鑒于目下該貨行情低廉、紛紛付銀訂定明春交貨之期貨不少、查二尺六尺十八張正號貨成交五百扎、價九元五角、又副號貨一千扎、價八元五角、三尺六張三張至十三張二百五十扎、價九元六角、聞係北蘇州路一帶五金號售出云、</p>

<p>— 余康生</p>
<p>先生教我們讀一本「愛迪生傳」。在這本書裏得來教訓，可以適應到我們的國貨事業上的計有兩件：</p>
<p>第一·有資本的人，應當組織財團，以生活及實騐所必需的費用，供給有發明天才的人，使他能够倣造外國已有的貨物；而更進一步，發明外國所沒有的貨物。愛迪生在發明電燈的過程中，一切的費用，都是美國的財團供給的。雖然經過了一年多的時間，沒有解决要做到的目的物，可是財團方面，依然信任他。要知道美國有這樣好的財團，才會產生愛迪生這般偉大的發明家。發明家原也是人，他的衣食住行不能解决，怎能專心去發展他的發明天才呢？何况我們的發明家，大都是困於財力的呢！所以這是第一件應幹的事。</p>
<p>第二，現在倣製的貨品，一天多一天，固然是國貨事業的進步；可是，事實告訴我們，有許多的國貨，完全是用外國原料做的，這便還嫌美中不足了。愛迪生發明電燈的時候，所用的燈絲，是從六千種竹絲，化了十萬的試騐費才得着的：那竹絲的原料，產自日本。後來，經過多年的實騐，他才選得本國製造的物料來做燈絲，棄日貨而不用。這一點正是我們國貨事業裏必定要幹的同樣工作；否則完全用外貨原料的國貨越是增多，那入超永無减少的一日，因爲卽令全國的人民都買國貨，可是國貨廠商，直接地批進外貨，國人豈不是間接去銷外貨嗎？所以國貨的技術人員，應該儘量研究，去發現出來，切不可長此因循下去。</p>
<p>我深信這兩件事能實現，才是國貨事業走上正軌的時候。比每年定一個××國貨年，一定有更顯著的進展。</p>
<h3 id="c285">各國學生對於國貨的觀念 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>日歷翻到了二十四年的第一頁，據說，又是第三個國貨年了。過去的婦女國貨年中的化裝品輸入量雖然未免有點使人難受；可是「往者已矣，來者可追」，在沒有辦法的心情下，也衹能說上那麼一句解嘲的傻話了——要不，便怎樣呢？</p>
<p>第三個國貨年落到了學生頭上，照例，學生是相當地具有一般知識水凖的份子，這年頭的成績也許並不會十分呌人難受的。</p>
<p>不過，就其少數說，學生中雖然也有一小部份，因爲一方面不缺少化費，一方面多接觸了一點西洋的文物，於是也許會把洋貨稍稍地着重一點，把洋貨看作是高貴的，時髦的；然而這也不能說這些學生就不知道愛國，充其量，也衹是他們（或她們）對於國貨的認識不足，與洋貨的崇拜熱的觀念的錯誤吧了</p>
<p>所以，趁着這簇新的「學生國貨年」的幕序剛才拉開的時候，把世界各國的學生對於國貨的觀念略略提一提，也未始不可作爲「他山之助」的吧？</p>
<p>（一）日本丨要說學生對於國貨的觀念，便得先打日本說起。日本在維新以前，國內的情勢正與目前的中國一樣的糟：國內生產貧乏，人民對於一切日常的用品，便不得取給於外國；而學生（尤其是大學生），因爲讀了一點西洋的書籍，便大家都把外國貨看重得不得了。可是到了維新後的五六十年中，一方面是國內的生產力加强，一切製品的質與量二方都提高了不少；而同時國家當局也利用了種種方法使學生採用國貨丨丨丨如以前聽說帝國大學學生非穿國貨制服，憑你成績怎樣優良，也不得畢業。而近年來呢，雖然學生界中十之九都穿西裝，但是質料却十之七八是他們自己的本國貨。最令人驚奇的便是他們用的自來水筆了——憑你歐美製品的派克與康克令怎樣時髦高貴，而他們却十之八九還是老老實實地用着他們自己的「大正萬年筆」！</p>
<p>（二）英國——英國是個富於保守與傳統性的國家，這是大家都知道。直到現在，重商主義（Ｍerchanalism)的氣息在他們的人民中還是相當地保存着。國家始終設法增加出超：人民呢，對於本國貨也特別注意。學生尤其如此，他們從小學生時代起，在家庭裏就受到了傳統的觀念，一聽到某種東西是「英國的」，便立刻感到一種親切與光榮。長大來便形成了一種本能了。平時的用品，從襯衫到領帶，從墨水到綱球拍，溜冰鞋，照相機等娛樂用品，雖然有德國的製品比他們好，但是他們却還喜歡用「英國的」，甚至書籍教本，普通往往有英美二種版子，美國的裝訂與印刷都比英國版講究，但他們却選了那較遜的本國版子買去了。</p>
<p>（三）法國丨法國是被一般人稱作「時髦之國」The　Country　of　Fashion的然而他們的學生，對於本國貨的愛好却比別國都深厚，平常用的書籍，文具，服裝，儀器，與女生的化裝品，不是里昂的貨色，便是巴黎的製品，「法國貨」對於法國的學生是一種無上的誇耀。</p>
<p>（四）德國丨德國從歐戰中吃了大虧，國內的狀况太壞了；靑年到學校去求學都不很容易，購用外國貨當然是辦不到的了。就在這十幾年的含辛茹苦中，他們的學生却完全養成了一種使用本國貨的熱心。</p>
<p>上面不過拿幾個大國的情形說了一下，其他如美，俄，意……等國的學生界，都是對於自己的本國貨有着特別的愛好的。在這「學生國貨年」中，中國的學生們，如果喜歡學外國的話，那末大可把他們學生愛用國貨的美德來學一下</p>

<p>一月六日午前九時，余在家無聊，遂作滬南國貨展覽會參觀，是日係星期例假，故參觀者更見擁擠。茲將會塲內之花絮，約略記之於後：</p>
<p>會塲假本市十六鋪裏馬路恒興里口，塲門出入口有二，均紥松柏之牌樓，縣黨國中旗一，另有布額一，上書：「中華國產廠商聯合會主辦滬南國貨展覽大會歡迎參觀」字樣，又有一聯曰：「發場中華國產」，「努力國貨救國」。</p>
<p>塲內陳列之廠家，約面餘家，塲地係搭建之凉棚，故高而且亮。陳列之出品，分棉織·絲織·毛織·食品·五金·皮革之類，其最佳者，有下列三處：</p>
<p>（一）上海香品社之化裝品，士女所用之香粉·蜜糖·胭脂·香水精·司丹康均有。聞自開幕以來，本市大中小學女生，已購去不少，足見「學生國貨年」中之好現象也。</p>
<p>（二）中央化學玻璃廠之玻璃器，有家用之茶杯花瓶，又有玻筒·玻管·玻罩等，不下二十餘種，足見我國化學前途之好現象也。</p>
<p>（三）美靈登廠之教育用品，有墨汁·顏色·退色水·廣告色·經濟墨水·自來墨水等，聞此種墨水，其色不變。製法，以電力磨研，故精細異常。余購得中國牌墨汁一瓶，衹銅幣十三枚，可謂廉矣</p>
<p>塲內站立警士數名，以防小竊之出現。塲外有滬南區東區救火會駐防處，又有滬南區保衛團第一隊駐防處，以防塲內發生意外之事。</p>
<p>聞展覽之期，衹兩週，然每日之營業，在一萬五千元以上，足見國人對於國產愛用之一般。余在塲內參觀一週，購者並不乏人，足見國人改良之果也。</p>
<p>余希望全市大中小學學生，際此「學生國貨年」中，皆應用國貨，一則可以不失「學生國貨年」之價値，二則可以發展我國之國產，全市莘莘學子，均當提倡實行之。</p>
<p>一週間國貨界新訊</p>
<p>▲學生國貨年推行委員會、日內將召集首次常務理事會議、討論推行辦法及組織分會事宜、</p>
<p>▲我國國貨自參加芝加哥博覽會之後、頗獲國際間之信譽、日前有南菲洲鉅商來華、與中華國貨產銷合作公司接洽，運送貨樣、該公司已允代辦名貴國產、不日起運、前往展覽、</p>
<p>▲張祥麟周貫虹董焜範等鑒於我國貨在芝博會之榮譽、擬在海外取得一市塲、發展我國國際貿易、特新計劃在芝設一大規模之產銷公司、聞張君等返國、卽開始進行、本市工商界領袖、亦頗多贊助、</p>
<p>▲常熟國展會、擬於廢歷燈節開幕、選定慧日寺爲臨時商塲、業已派員在滬、徵求廠產參加、</p>
<p>▲新近檀香山需要大批竹蔑、比國需漢口桐油、法國需各種化學品、（酸類）各出口商可逕向該局接洽、</p>
<p>▲上海機聯會以法租界當局不顧一切、越權檢查我國工廠、特組特種委員會、推定委員十三人、根據大會决議、籌謀有效對付、</p>
<p>▲前傳波蘭排斥華貨、但據波使館宣稱、並無其事、</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>一項康元先生的談話丨</p>
<p>（問）項先生以爲如何培養根鬚與樹幹</p>
<p>（答）國內的人，往往迷信南洋華僑富有資產，我以爲國內的人也許更比華僑殷實。不過華僑的錢，都在市面上流通，若是僅有兩三個錢，要做十個錢生意，而國內富有的人，喜歡把錢存在銀行，尤其外國銀行，有十個錢，也不肯做一個錢生意，同一是錢，一死一活，這與國計民生的關係，實在影響太大了。在國內常聽見一句口號「歡迎華僑投資祖國，開發實業」我想這話太偏見了。華僑固然應該投資祖國，而國內的富翁，也應該移資到南洋去，維持華僑經營的大小工商業的。他們把錢存入外國銀行，不過想靠一面英國旗或美國旗來保護，那倒不如索性移資到南洋去，託庇於整個外人勢力之下，不是更有保障麼？這倒不是笑話，南洋有許多地方，的確需要國人去投資，大論大工業小工業，目前都很蕭條呢。</p>
<p>依我管見，南洋不但缺乏雄厚的資本，而且缺乏專門的人才，一方面投資，一方面還要希望良好的人才都去發展，最好就是人才隨資本而去，資本一去，人才去便有辦法。從前閩廣人士南渡，費四五元可達彼岸，如今非一百元不辦，而且當地政府，訂種種苛例限制得很嚴，登岸手續，又十分麻煩，（尤其是荷屬）國人都視爲畏途。出洋的人，旣感種種苦痛，如今已成「要去者無錢，有錢者不去。」的情形，最好利用資本與人才相互爲用，謀共同的發展。總之，有志於南洋者，無論出錢與出力，直接關於華僑經濟，間接有關國計民生，在此可知其重要性了。此後華僑工商業，如其需要資本，國內便應該設法接濟，沒錢的人要到南洋去發展，大家來資助他，作有組織的移民，如此恰是「人盡其才地盡其利」的道理。</p>
<p>（問）南洋羣島目前以那幾種商品爲最需要？</p>
<p>（答）棉織品，日用品，絲綢，需要爲最廣，這幾種雖然西洋貨都有，但價値總比日貨爲高，一般人總喜歡貪便宜，日貨自然到處暢銷，論其質地，日貨只重形式，並不堅牢；可惜我們國貨很少發現，否則以貨比貨，不次於東西洋貨的。</p>
<h3 id="c288">嫩臉皮 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 凈潭</p>
<p>牆角許多落葉，由枯綠漸褪成焦黃，這是象徴著嚴冬在伸張着它的權力了</p>
<p>小蘭這幾天早晨起來，到工作的地方做事去，她走在北風凜冽的途中，她把手藏在衣袋裏面，但她那嫩臉皮却給寒風吹得有點兒刺痛；她心裏很煩惱！她恐怕她的臉皮慢慢地會凍裂了，那不是很難看嗎！她又不願意學那些有錢的太太小姐們，花費很多的錢去買洋貨美容品；她想；「在這婦女國貨年的當中，婦女却老着臉皮去買洋貨，那不是很可恥嗎。」所以她雖然聽說「洋蜜」能保護皮膚，但她却因爲那是洋貨不屑用。她試用國產的蜂蜜，又嫌太黏；這護膚的問題真把她難住了！</p>
<p>有一天，小蘭在她的女友的家裏，看見她的女友在洗面後，從一個扁方的玻璃瓶子裏，倒出來些白色的流質向臉上擦。</p>
<p>「你怎麼沒有愛國心，要使用那種洋蜜呢？」小蘭帶着責備的口氣說。</p>
<p>「這不是洋蜜，這是國產的星球牌潤膚蜜呀！」她的女友一邊說着，一邊把那個扁瓶送過來。</p>
<p>她接到手裏一看，果然上面有「五洲藥房創製的」的字樣；同時她又詢悉這種國產純蜜，不但質料很好，并且價也較廉。</p>
<p>當天小蘭就去買回這種國貨潤膚蜜，從此她走在嚴冬的途中，再不畏寒風的侵襲了。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　僻地輕官遠來强項令華廳盛宴外有可憐蟲</p>
<p>只他這一句，屋子外面，有人哈哈大笑道：我也贊成！好辦法，好辦法！那人也是說話帶了浙江音，笑了進來。張介夫一想，這人怎麼這樣的放肆？看時，一個三十多歲的人，薙着平頭，面孔紅紅的，大眼睛，身上穿件藍湖縐夾袍，把袖子捲起，露出兩截大粗胳臂來，倒有幾分蠻實的樣子。志前笑着讓坐，就向兩下裏介紹，說他是周縣長。他笑道：什麼周縣長，周戇大罷了。張介夫道：台甫是有容。他笑道：張先生何以知道？介夫道：看此地的報紙上登着，有一位周有容縣長，很有政聲，請假到西安來了，也住在小西天，所以我這樣猜的。周有容向志前望着微笑道：我總算値得。人死留名，豹死留皮，倒弄了一個很有政聲的批評。哈哈！其實我不是政聲，我是丟醜，我是給人打了一頓。打得睡了兩個禮拜，實在幹不下了，才借了請假爲名，逃到西安來的。張介夫聽了，不由得愕然，問道：我忘了在報上看到的周縣長在那一縣，這縣的人民，有這樣兇嗎？周有容笑道：若是老百姓打了我，我還說什麼？定是我的官做得不好。程志前笑道：張先生不要誤會。在三四年以前，西北各縣的縣政，果然是不好辦。這兩年以來，陝西的政治，總算上了軌道。關中這些縣分，尤其是很有秩序。只是極南或極北的邊界上，交通不便利，西安去封公事，來往要二個月，若是那地方有了舊日的防軍，財政上流轉不通的時候，多少有點掣肘　周縣長這一縣，恰是三縣交界的所在。那裏的軍事領袖，又是前五六年留任到現在的，所以他不容易對付。（一二○）</p>

<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>現在的天氣，不是已入了冬季麼？咦！那末：怎覺得像溫和的春天一樣，難道「天不變，道亦不變，」這句話眼前眞也有些不對了：你！不看見朝朝罩着重霧，淸晨起來，要瞧見對面來的人，也不很容易，以前人說：「三朝迷霧發西風，」不料時時有迷霧，西風偏不肯吹，有幾天，還像晝晦，層雲密密的像要壓下來一般，以爲「天公在上面做雪，」不一會，要紛紛降雪，變成了一片銀世界，豈知晨曦淸朗，一輪旭日，又在東天照着，那氣溫非但不見降低，反而升高，眞像已經交了春，在和煦的當兒淸明時節，你想，奇怪不奇怪！</p>
<p>最覺詫異的，到郊外去一望，田間的麥，靑靑的隨風飄拂，像綠波輕輕盪漾，那麥穗正在吐出，而蠶豆也特別發育，枝莖高可尺許，蝴蝶狀的花蕾，也似飛舞，放出美麗的形態來：還有油菜生出劍，他的尖頭開了朶朶十字花，作金黃色，燦爛的非常悅目，倘說：不是春天，試問那裏會得有這種景象呢！不但這樣，有時還看見蒼蠅和馬蟻的行蹤，還沒有銷聲匿跡，簡直不是冬天，轉變了春天了；有人說：這是老天的好意，去年在夏秋的時候，又是熱，又是乾，小民何等苦惱，茍延到今朝，不曾餓死得盡凈，還經得大寒大冷啊！所以天亦發了慈心，把這個冬季取消，提前改行春令，吾說不錯，不過有穿有吃的，儘管燒着火爐，披着重裘，在攝生上倒也千萬不可大意。</p>

<p>— 毛震陽</p>
<p>今天我因事到靜安寺去。當我踏上了七路公共汽車的時候，看見車廂內，先已坐着一位穿着西裝革履的漂亮朋友，他很驕矜地將眼光移向車窗外邊，左腿擱在右膝上，不住的抖動着。</p>
<p>不多時，車身動了；一會兒，已離開徐家匯向西疾馳過去。我們照例都買了一張車票，自然，那位西裝朋友也不能例外，但他正在買票的時候，恰巧有一陣風吹過，托他所買的票子，吹向窗外去了。他不禁呆了一呆，但他仍裝做若無其事的坐着；這時買票的也已看見了，很客氣地請那位西裝朋友補票，而那位西裝朋友呢，非但不肯補票，反把那賣票的大罵了一頓。賣票的見他很倔强，也就軟化了。</p>
<p>不久，忽然來了一個查票的外個人，他查到這位朋友，見他沒有票子，就用洋話問他曾否購票？那知這位朋友，竟不曾讀過洋書，所以他一些不懂，獃獃地站在那外人面前，連換氣都不敢換一口。</p>
<p>這時那位賣票者得勢了，便趁勢大發其威武，把那位神氣十足的西裝少年，罵得哭笑不得，甚至罵他是個剃頭師父</p>
<p>我坐在旁邊，很驚奇地注視着那位漂亮朋友，爲什麼當着洋人面前，就連開口都沒有勇氣呢！正想立起來替他辯白，但他已很爽快地從衣袋裏摸出了補票的代價，畏畏縮縮的付給那位洋人了。我於是不再多說，衹覺得這位西裝朋友，削盡了我們中國人的顏面。</p>
<p>幸而終站到了，他便很快地從人叢中擠了下去，當我下車時，已不見他的踪影了。</p>

<p>他們再拜奉命之下，便並立在御座的前面，取出隨帶的歷書和筆硯來十分鄭重地推算着、太后也正襟危坐，靜心等候他們的答復。我其時恰好也在太后的背後侍立着，目擊他們在做這種徒然浪費光陰的勾當、不禁暗暗好笑，而且還非常的着急，深恐他們會推算出不好的結果來。因爲我對於長白山松花江那邊的景象，實在比太后傾慕得更厲害，早就想前去遊覽一番，無奈沒有機會；這一次已到了奉天，又碰着太后也高興，所以格外的興奮着要去，而惟恐這兩位欽天監的老爺給我們搗亂了！尤其使我悠然神往的是一段載在某一冊裨史上的記述，它把我們的始祖出生歷史，形容得像神話一樣的荒誕動聽。它說：</p>
<p>「在歷史上所不能查考的日期以前，長白山附近的原野裏，流着一條水淸可鑑的的小溪，細而密的波紋，在給太陽光照着的當兒、眞像銀魚身上的鱗甲一樣美麗。有一個初夏的早上，天氣是特別的熱，臨溪人家一位素著艷名的閨女便獨自跳到這溪中來游泳，正當浮沉之際，忽見碧綠的水面上，有一顆鮮紅可愛的櫻桃在浮動；伊瞧得好玩，忙趕過去把它撈起來，一口吞了下去。這原是一件很平常的事情，伊自己也全不曾注意：不料隔了幾個月，伊的肚子竟漸漸地大起來了，人家都笑伊是不嫁而孕，紛紛地議論着。衹有伊的父母知道伊平日的行爲很端正，不信伊眞有什麼可恥的私情；但伊實在是有孕，後來終於生出了一個很肥壯的男孩子來。這個男孩子便是所有的滿洲人的始祖…」！（二三○）</p>

<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>在本報上曾讀到兩位先生後寫的關於『金扁擔』的故事，這的確是酒後茶餘的絕好談資。現在記者也寫一則『討飯棒』的佳話，雖則並無多大意識，但當此奢侈成風的年頭，也許可作節儉運動的一助，而不背國奢示儉的原則吧。</p>
<p>這個討飯棒，至今在奉南兩縣間還有人輾轉樂道，因爲這個故事的主人，就生長在這兩縣中的一縣，雖則現在是早作古人了。故事是怎樣的，這討飯棒主人，爲的幼時家徒四壁，父母又雙雙亡去，而他年齡幼小，沒有能力謀事，爲着生活所迫，只好拿了一根棒，提了一隻籃，出去做討飯的乞丐了。俗諺說：『討飯三年懶做官』，何况他旣沒有受過教育，又沒有學過職業，旣走上了這討飯的一條路，自然一直把乞丐做他的正當職業了。不過，他就因爲熬受過饑寒困苦，在這討飯的過程中，極力撙節，不輕花費半文，這樣，聚沙成塔，集腋成裘，等到討了數十年的飯，手頭居然積蓄了好多的錢；他便把這些錢買田耕種，又因他處處儉約的關係，愈積愈多，差不多成了個小康之家。接着造屋娶妻，生子又抱孫，他由乞丐一變而爲封翁了。他那時的家訓，自然不外克勤克儉四個字；並且把他那根討飯棒，表示不忘本，並作子孫的棒喝起見，也愼重地供在中堂之上。嗣後遇到他子孫不遵家訓，無故浪費，就用這根討飯棒來儆戒責罰，子孫想到創業維艱，也就幡然悔悟了。</p>
<p>討飯棒主人死了之後，他的孫子漸漸蕃衍起來，蔚成巨族。但對這根討飯棒，還是髙髙供起，遇到族人不肖，也仍拿這根討飯棒來戒責。所以這根討飯棒，至今還握着這一族中的最髙的權威咧</p>

<p>— 顏文初自菲島寄</p>
<p>日前各華報宣佈總領事署，接上海市長來電，謂滬上華商熱烈籌備參加本屆岷里刺嘉年華會，請總領事爲帮忙一切，其目的在謀華菲親善云云。記者請掇錄該會性質及內容，俾我國商界，略知適從焉。</p>
<p>嘉年華僑英文爲Carnival，即歐美洲之聖狂節，美人入菲後，始開始舉行，純屬股東營業性質，政府居於提倡輔助地位，歷屆股東有新舊之別，新股納股份二十元，給以優美徽章，免購門劵，得入大禮堂八夜，參觀種種表演及跳舞有複選嘉年華會花后兩票之權舊股衹納半費，除同免購門票外，所享權利，亦衹折半，至股本紅利，則歷來大會閉會，即歸烏有，故該會入欵，以門票股欵租地費（塲中劃地租與私家陳列，或表演馬戲。）廣告費（塲周圍牆壁皆畫廣告）等爲大宗。</p>
<p>選舉華後兼稱菲律賓女士，初選各日報閱報人，在一個月期中，每日有一票選權，各註册日報，可推一候選人，亦可自由印票，備競爭者納費多購，故在初選中，各報館可多得一筆售票費，初選旣竟，將中選者像片，由該會懸辦事室外，任人欣賞，訂期初選中選人及股東開跳舞會，（非股東亦得購入塲券參加。）於是開始複選。複舉之權在股東，大家閨秀，欲繼承此十六夜王冕之虛榮，則受意親朋，代爲運動，有時運動劇烈，非有萬以上股權，不能中選。故乞　金錢，爲常有事。五年前變更複選制，另組織評判員，爲審美觀察。凡初選人須穿浴衣褲，聽男性評判員逼近觀察，天主教會大起反對，股東頓形减少，始恢復舊制。</p>
<p>會塲構造，雜木爲柱，編篾作壁，髹以彩色，安置電光。故入夜燈火輝煌，大跳舞廳佈置更屬堂皇華麗，會中陳列可分爲三部：（一）公共陳列，即各省土產及各機關，如學校監獄成績品，各部各局歷來辦事表格，（二）商家陳列，（三）各種游戲，如馬戲笑劇幻術滑車種種，皆須另購入塲劵，（四）餐店酒館及販賣雜物等，在四五年前，津滬閩廣各處，曾運到大批國貨，加入陳列，國民政府派穆藕初次長，來菲參與盛會，歡迎酬酢，幾無虛日，華菲親善熱度，自然因此而增進幾分。現國內多難，外侮日亟，日本虎視東亞，菲島政治舞臺上要角，皆重視扶桑三島，日菲親善，是誠意希望的，中菲親善，是口頭應酬的。如本屆在菲興行遠運會，竟爲日本所屈服。解散具有廿餘載歷史之遠東運動會，舊事重提，國際貽羞，此後專賴國民外交，促進中菲親善，或可减少議院中苛待華僑提案，誠我南僑所心香頂祝者。</p>
<p>加入陳列，亦可爲國貨求出路，當注重於日常用品，三友實業社棉織品，上海泰豐與厦門陶化大同罐頭等，皆合菲人消路。若福州漆器，江西瓷器，古香古色之銅器與木刻，衹供參觀者欣賞，因屬於裝飾品，消路不廣，絲織品中風景人物，可嵌入鏡框中者，價廉物美，亦合需要。蓋茅屋草舍中，幾家家懸掛風景畫，此則徵求出品者，應知所注意也。</p>
<p>該會不特爲平民娛樂機關，因觀客雲集，市面得以繁榮，且政界欲提倡何項事業，皆藉此會宣傳，容易發生效力。如此地雞蛋，本來自中國與日本，全年漏出非幣一百七十餘萬。政府欲鼓吹民間養雞，不特爲文字圖書宣傳，幷陳列各色雞種，其孵雛飼養法，皆照其經過排列，又築各種大小不同之雞塒，於庭前屋後𨻶地，皆可闢爲家庭小規模養雞塲，觀衆目懦耳染，不三年各鄉村養雞大著威效，去年入口量數。已减少三分之一矣。</p>

<h3 id="c296">關於自然科學與文學的浸透問題 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>香山先生在其「文學與科學之相互浸透問題」</p>
<p>一文中，以爲自然科學與文學的浸透問題乃是主題的處理問題，而不是方法的問題，由這一論據出發，香山先生就提出他的「利用文學的形式，以自然科學爲素材」的科學文學，及科學的空想小說這一結論來；把這種科學文學，科學小說當作自然科學和文學的滲透問題的整個姿態，而排斥了把自然科學作爲文學方法的一個要素的方法問題。</p>
<p>我以爲像髙爾基所說的「文學的名匠須輔助科學的實踐的名匠，以簡單的平易的形式，表現科學的思想理論與工作。」這一通俗的科學文學的提倡，只不過是作爲過渡期中的科學底普遍化之一工具，至於在未來的最高形態的社會中，這種利用文學形式表現自然科學理論的科學文學，是否仍屬必要，還是成爲問題的。</p>
<p>如果我們從另一角度上細味香山先生的意見，則嫌其未免失之偏狹和機械。因爲文學與自然科學的相互浸透問題，不但是主題底處理問題，而且也是方法的問題。</p>
<p>香山先生說：「至於有人之提倡以自然科學方法來處理文學，描寫創作（？），以心理遺傳等等的分析，可獲得成功，可是覺得不同意的。如果如此，則弗羅以德的心理分析就該成爲文學上最好的方法了，然而事實相反，我們進步的方法却是基於社會科學上的。」</p>
<p>這段話粗看起來好像很澈底，實際上却並不然的。前進的文學方法是基於社會科學上的，這句話只有針對着現實底正確的認識這一問題上才是恰當的；然而光是現實底正確的認識，光是社會科學的常識底積纍，却成不了文學，主要的還在形象的表現這一點上。我之說文學與自然科學的相互滲透問題是方法的問題，也並不就是像香山先生所說的以自然科學方法來處理文學，——如果這樣，那也活該呌香山先生不同意的。香山先生的意見多少是對於這一「方法問題」的歪曲或不了解而來的丨丨我之說「也是方法問題」，正是意味着把由於自然科學（心理學，生理學，生物學，善學，遺傳學等等）而更加深刻化正確化的心理或生理的變化底纖細的描寫，作爲綜合的形式，作爲具有一種豐富性的多彩的文學底技術之一要素而說的。把一切都訴之生理（性慾……），心理，遺傳等等，那是弗羅以德主義，心理主義的濫觴，當然是不對的。</p>
<p>光靠社會科學理論的分析所得的社會集團，人物，等等抽象的槪念，在藝術的意味上，並不就能够成爲性格的典型的人物。在中國；同樣在日本，那種把社會科學理論的分析底結果，簡單地用文學的形式表現出來的觀念的主觀的描寫，正是新文學底初期作品底主要缺點。我們所要描寫的是作爲現實社會底細胞的活生生的人物，在這些活生生的人物的生活裏面，就包含着活生生的觀喜，憤怒，悲哀，歡樂，幽默，愛憎等情感，牠們互相交識，滲透，而組成了各種不同的性格底典型。因而在綜合的形式上，對於各種不同的人物底性格，心理底特質底纖細的描寫，是不要的；缺了這，典型化是不可能的。在這裏，關於人物底性格的階級底特徵底認識，社會科學和自然科學都是有着作用的。我們决不能否認生理學，心理學所給與自然主義作家左拉等的影響，同樣也不能够否認醫學所給與寫實派的印象主義作家契訶夫的作品的影響丨丨這種影響在人物底病態底特徵的描寫，在「六號室」中對於瘋子伊凡底瘋狂的心理描寫，在「黑衣僧」中對於主人公底神經錯亂的描寫上可以明白地看出來。</p>
<p>但是，在這點上我們所不能忽略的是：心理學上之在現實的人物底心理底認識和描寫上的作用，只是作爲一種指導的東西，正如社會科學在現實底認識上一樣。至於人物底性格，心理，意識等等的描寫之不能離開社會的條件，那是不用細說的事。</p>

<p>留心做生意的，看見吳家館子每年賺錢，心裏都不免覬覦。同行的小館子，因資本短，往往不能和吳家館抗爭。好像吳家館子在胥鎭上成了唯一的館子，有了吳家館，似乎不能再有第二個館子似的。不說別的，就是住在本鎭的，或是遠路來的旅客，如有宴客，都非到吳家館不可，彷彿到吳家館去請客，是很有面子的事，不管吳家館的菜價定得如何貴，或者菜燒得如何不出色，他們都滿不在乎的。　　胥鎭人烟稠密，車船輻輳，也是江南一個大鎭，但像樣的館子，除掉吳家館，確是沒有第二家了。這也奇怪，在吳家館的威名下，一向沒有大館子出現，所以吳家館的營業，幾乎可算是獨佔。</p>
<p>吳家館向來保持它的聲譽。</p>
<p>但是今年，忽有幾個外路客商，集了大股本，打算在鎭上再開一家大館子，店面的裝璜，和生財傢伙，一律模仿吳家館；燒菜方面，特別加工：定價克己。他們是預備和吳家館競爭的，因之把店號呌做「胡家館。」</p>
<p>胡家館一開張，生意却是意外的好。這現象，不僅給吳家館的老闆覺得驚駭，便是鎭上人，也是千萬料不到。胡家館子開了半年，人家都說：</p>
<p>「吳家館完子，從前的吳家館變成現在的胡家館了……」</p>
<p>奇怪，胡家館正像一塊大磁石，把許多主顧吸收着。從前吳家館的老顧客，彷彿狂風中的枯葉，一瓣瓣吹到胡家館去了。這樣，吳家館百年來的老招牌，在尖銳化的營業競爭裏，失去了往日的盛譽。</p>
<p>吳家館的生意一天天淸淡了……</p>
<p>店老板坐在賬桌裏，抽着那支烟，毫無事做。以前，坐在賬桌裏，開賬單，管錢，寫賬，忙得不開交：有幾天甚至連夜飯都没空喫。店堂裏僱的六個堂倌，川流不息的走，忙得呌爸娘。兩個燒菜的，燒了這隻菜，馬上又燒那隻，只覺來不及。但現在，堂倌只雇了兩個，却還是閒起來。</p>
<p>「總要和胡家館爭一下才好！」</p>
<p>吳家館的老板决定和胡家館爭，便在各處貼廣告，說是從某某日起，到某某日止，廉價二禮拜。把廣告貼出後，生意果然好起來，許多長久不交易的主顧也來了。老板心裏快活，情願把本錢犧牲，要和胡家館爭口氣。可是兩禮拜的廉價過去了，生意又馬上回復到淸淡，幷且，在吳家館的廣告旁邊，明鮮鮮的發現了胡家館的新廣告，那廣告上寫着：</p>
<p>「大廉價一月丨」</p>
<p>於是胡家館的生意，跟着競爭的勝利，一天天興隆了。……</p>
<h3 id="c298">班哖埠 <a href="#c298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— 雙兒</p>
<p>新被建立起來的班哖埠，在橡皮張價時候像小孩子玩肥皂泡般被吹得漲大起來，現得燦爛的色彩；却又在橡皮跌價時緊縮了，像肥皂泡在空中的突然破裂。</p>
<p>在班哖河和咪拉河的匯口中心，遠遠地優可望見一些疏散的白牆紅瓦的小屋子在密叢的綠林間浮現出來，有像浮彫的畫圖。牠的兩臂伸出來的是黑𪐶𪐶的森林，在河中看起來眞是一幅美景。待舟子一靠近班哖埠岸，一間紅色的煤油公司的建築物和一個凹入的小船塢便用荷蘭帝國的長長的大字體呈露出來，接着的是長長的板橋伸入河中，一些商店的厠所用着警察的崗亭的姿勢在河床上排列起來。在漲潮的水面上，黃色的糞便混著樹頭和樹葉在水面上漂浮，而馬來舟子緊擠在輪船和小汽輪間盪漾在急潮上面。</p>
<p>從海關前的一道堅牢的板橋上岸，穿過縣政府衙門，郵政電報局，殖民地軍營和地方監獄的前面，班哖埠便以一道長馬路伸展開來。在這道熱鬧的街道後面，有幾道馬路却以幽靜而迷人的境地造起白人·華人，和馬來人的住家。沒有看見汽車，脚踏車却在矯健的馬來人和活潑的中國靑年們脚下迅速地滾動起來。一種異常的沈寂籠罩在這縣政府所在地。（初從　濁的新加坡進入此日的時候，我曾疑心我的耳朶和眼睛的：但我終以一種甜蜜的心情來接受這個新天地所給我的感覺了。）只有在這街道的兩極端，荷巫學校和中華學校的小生徒們琅琅的書聲被空氣流傳出來，像替這個沈寂的宇宙奏着微妙的樂調。</p>
<p>「十年前，這個地方的中國商人和富有的馬來　主，是曾用貨袋裝滿着鈔票的。從遠遠的樹林裏面，中國商人靠着一脚被積水浸成的肥腫的赤脚，擠着橡皮來這海口上向輪船『當載』，是會把金子滿滿裝成袋的。——現在，找一張五十盾的鈔票都不容易啦。」上岸時甲必丹先生告訴我，並且搖着慨嘆。</p>
<p>阿興却搶着接下去：「那時的店夥和苦力們都天天喝白蘭地，賭五十盾的麻將，買一斤肉價値八角錢的猪肉啦：現在，——丨鬼殺他們·——一盾錢的麻將都賭不起，屠子不肯多殺一只猪。——當心，一個禮拜只吃一次牛肉，慢些兒菜蔬都會買不起的。」說後他便把頭俯下去，做着他舊日的黃金之夢。</p>
<p>班哖的繁榮眞的是變成過去了，或者在將來，人類會把這地方造成另一個繁榮的面目吧！現在留在這灰色的埠頭上面，和繁壓在窮困的小民心上的，却只有一個鐵面無情的荷蘭縣長和他的秘書，一個兇惡面相的荷蘭兵頭」和他部下的爪哇兵士，一個盡職征歛的政府收稅員和一個傀儡的班哖王以及一個從五百元資本起家的甲必丹先生，在做着維持殘局的勾當！</p>
<p>這便是：四個白種人，一個黃種人，和一個椶色人種，是合夥築成現在的班哖埠的一切。</p>

<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>偶而的機緣，到那麼一個小小的鄉鎭上來教了三個月書；學期結束，我就將怱怱的走了，像怱怱的來一樣地。</p>
<p>短短三個月的鄉鎭生活沒有離奇的觀感可說，在那裏我發現了自家更深的寂寞，生命的荒凉，同時，更給我看見了鄉村的窮窘狀况，在湖匪槍擾中的居民的恐惶狼狽；然而那些埋怨年勢的農民的聲音，也有誰理應嗎？</p>
<p>雖然在黃昏的境界裏，我常有機會享着另一種消受，我的寓所的鄰居是一家大米行主人的住宅，黃昏上總開着話匣子，天賜與我一點小小享福的機會，隔着牆壁聽梅蘭芳的拿手好戲，聽顫着肉麻嗓子的桃花江曲，同時有年輕的女兒們在應和着唱，歌聲裏滲着笑聲；在這境界裏，給你冥想到燈米裏展開着的淡紅色的幸福生活。</p>
<p>微雨陰霾的日子，走到河岸上，聽江北開來做小生意的䑵䑵船上的婦人，爲着沒米燒飯而哭泣。</p>
<p>夕陽落後，河岸上常有拖着蹣跚的脚步，駄着包裏赴夜路的旅人。</p>
<p>在一些小鋪子前，有土色了臉巴的鄉民在談着湖匪狙擊的情况。</p>
<p>三個月留居浦莊，我僅有的見聞只有這一些兒；爲着生活，我就要怱怱地離開這小鄉鎭了，對於學校，跟幾位可親切的朋友，臨別之前，免不了懷着一點小小留戀；然而我終於要默然離開他們，茫茫的世界裏，我要跨上遼遠的征途去。</p>
<p>離浦莊後，卽將束裝去皖，嚴寒的冬天，將在我怱怱的旅途中滑過去吧！不久將是春初時節；我惟一的希望，一聽南國的朋友們！到時還寄我江南的春訊。</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>這念頭旣經引起之後，我全部精神，就從西屋的烟榻的情形，以及詢問生意情形中，奔脫出來，我要試着探詢一點她個人的身事。</p>
<p>不錯，她可以說是一個苦命人，她把她的一段困苦惡劣的遭遇告訴了我。她這位媽，我也知道不但不是她的親媽，也不是繼母。</p>
<p>他的年紀，像我斷定她的一樣，是十七歲，是哈爾濱下江新甸人，家裏本是種莊稼的，一九三二年七月松花江的一塲大水，把她的家冲散了，就把她冲到哈爾濱來。領她來的是她的一個表嫂，她口口聲聲要設法拯救表妹的困境，她也認爲表嫂是唯一的親人，想不到這大好人貪圖了六十塊哈大洋，就忘去了情義把她送到這個地方，還給她找了這個年靑的媽。她自已換了裝束，剪了髮辮，變成一個都市中時髦的少女。生活就這樣過下去了。可是，她還是免不了時常想念故有的家鄉，和她親生的父母兄弟。尤其是當一個橫暴無比的客人，毫不留情地摧殘她的肉體時，更使她憶及過去的舊事。罪惡滿佈的都市深淵，正在漸漸地吞蝕着她這個弱小的女子。</p>
<p>國家觀念，她沒有，對生活掙扎，她也不想，她只願早早死去，就算了結了心願。天不怨地不怨她只怨命運不濟，而大水恰是趕她入地獄，進墳墓的追命鬼。</p>
<p>當我告訴她，說那次大水是××人搗的鬼，有意掘了堤，爲的要淹滅下江一帶抗戰的義勇重時，她那時情形的緊張，還有憤恨的程度，簡直讓我形容不出。我可以說，比她逃水災時，要緊張百倍。她不住憤憤地叫着：</p>
<p>「是那樣的麼？是那樣的麼？是那樣的呀！是那樣呀！」</p>
<p>她的兩手握得緊緊的，那神情好像要去找××人拚命。</p>
<p>眞的，有多少人知道那一次的水災是××人搗的鬼？要不是一個親手掘堤的人，他告訴我，我何嘗不認爲是一塲天災！</p>
<p>西屋裏傳出一片大笑聲，大槪是我的朋友發了「雄」威，我聽到他大聲呌喊着：</p>
<p>「不行！非來一個嘴不行！」</p>
<p>何必向她要一個嘴！我正自這樣忖量時，西屋裏已經沒有動靜了，冷不防小菊伸出兩隻手緊緊握住我的兩手，身上像在打着冷戰，有如一個乞憐的小鳥兒。我看了她一會，看出她是受到了某種恐怖的襲擊才這樣的，一刻前，她還向我滔滔不絕述說身世呢。我也忘去了這情形是叫我有些不好意思的，我的臉更沒有紅，我只是在想，她是怕哪一個？說來這個小屋裏除了我以外，再沒有生客，那麼怕我？不對，怕我她不會親近我。我這樣未免錯想了她。</p>

<h3 id="c301">翻譯年與創作年 <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— 親綠</p>
<p>在「文學」新年號上讀到某君一篇文章，說「祝愿今年該繼雜誌年而爲翻譯年」</p>
<p>我以爲；在中國還沒有產生更偉大的作品以前，期今年以「創作年，」無論在那一方面，都比「翻譯年」來得更有意義。</p>
<p>翻譯人材培養的困難，較之創作人材，奚止十倍；各國語文底隔閡，不能本能地熟錬運用，固然是一個障礙；然而最大的原因，尙不在此，要曉得翻譯文藝作品底任務，非僅以把外國文「章名地」變成形式的本國語爲已足：更要憑自己底修養，來探究原作者底靈魂深處，抓住他下筆時思想底形成，然後把它凈化入我底筆端；纔能成爲一篇眞實的譯文。這種譯文，原著者和譯述者已溶而爲一了。</p>
<p>各人底世界觀是何等樣的不同，以個別異殊的認識力，來翻譯同一的作品縱然弄得「滿頭大汗，」而眞的氣息是不存在的，剩下來的不過是些尸氣騰騰的還魂屍而已；至於全文底意思都不明白借了字典來一句句硬譯的，那更不必說了！</p>
<p>市上少有完好的翻譯作品，不是沒來由的。</p>
<p>中國文壇底貧乏，不止譯述；創作嘗不如此！與其做「吃力不討好」的翻譯工作，何如就近在創作上努力一些，也許創作底收穫，較諸翻譯，要多些，有價値些。</p>
<p>努力創作有兩種意義：</p>
<p>一、質底努力：Ａ養成健全的世界觀。（作品眞實性。）（內容條件。）Ｂ開發新鮮題材。Ｃ運用圓熟技巧。（作品表現力。）（形式條件。）</p>
<p>二、量底努力：Ａ肅淸牛鬼神蛇的袁中郎派時，公安文，竟陵文，古色古香文，以及一切非驢非馬的小雜文。（消極工作）Ｂ提携新人材，鼓勵長篇作品的產生。</p>
<p>我期望不是空喊的創作年底來臨。</p>
<h3 id="c302">某年紀事 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>「少爺，火車斷了！」</p>
<p>睡夢中被喊聲驚醒：是李馬，一對小蹄子的脚像不够支持她那肥大身體的重量似的，在我帳門前搖擺不定，說話的聲音彷彿被什麼物件堵塞着，變成粗拙的濁音了，她見我醒來後只是向她打量，就用大聲說：</p>
<p>「少爺，火車呌了半夜天，你不聽見嗎？城里已經完全住着灰老虫了；見了人就拉，阿雲買小菜幾乎被拉了去，菜籃，秤都丟了呢。前面小橋頭桂生屋里，就被灰老虫撬門進去，他們父子兩個嚇得跳後河跳走。丨現在在我們門前東張西望，阿雲把石臼磨子都堆起來堵門…」她舉起肥大的手掌作了個姿勢，「少爺，我要回去了，被灰老虫拉去要做炮灰的！」</p>
<p>不及我回答，她把樓板頓得怪響下樓去了。</p>
<p>這幾天報上的情形，我們這縣城爲了有鐵道溝通的緣故，遲早是要被牽入戰綫的。半夜里火車加多，不是從昨夜始，城里有些財產的，早已避難走了，這情形李馬是沒有知道，否則，她一聽說打仗就要喊回家去，今天或者她已安然回家不受到驚嚇了。不過我却猜測着何以軍隊開來之後火車反斷了呢，這在軍事上不是絕大的矛盾嗎？</p>
<p>我下樓去，阿雲和李媽都呆坐在堂屋里，像兩個堆塑的泥像。李媽挾着衣包，哭喪着臉說：</p>
<p>「少爺，街上已不能走人了！」</p>
<p>「眞的，看見人就要拉，」阿雲也說：「我親眼見的！」</p>
<p>我沒有理會他們的話，從堆着石臼磨子的門隙中向外望去，街上眞的沒有一個人。前面桂生屋里，門開直着，一個本地人模樣的從他屋里挑出一擔白菜来。</p>
<p>「地痞才可怕呢！」我心里想，「丘八沒有搶光，到是自家人挑了走。」</p>
<p>那個人已經慢慢的走近來，瞧淸楚了那頂壓在眉際的破氈帽，我驚呆了，他不是桂生嗎？手忙脚亂的搬去了石臼磨子，開出門去喊住他。</p>
<p>「少爺，開到了兵呢。」</p>
<p>他把菜擔停了下來，像「今天好呵」</p>
<p>地招呼我。</p>
<p>「李媽說灰老虫撬你家的門，你們跳河逃了呢？」</p>
<p>「不是的。」他微笑地搖着頭，「昨夜里不知爲什麼突然開到了三千多兵，城里廟宇，學堂都借給他們兵隊了；今天要人做飯，就見了掛菜籃的人都拉去，聽說一天有四角小洋工資呢。剛才有兩個灰老虫從這裏走過。看見橋邊的菜園，就來敲門問我，他們肯出兩塊錢一擔，到是今年第一次好賣買。少爺，我</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>送進城去，回頭會。」</p>
<p>我目送桂生走後，回過頭來，阿雲和李媽也立在我背後，面上已裝着笑臉，我知道他們聽見桂生的話，就問李媽：</p>
<p>「要回家去嗎？」</p>
<p>她不好意思地向裏跑了。我吩咐阿雲到園里掘點菜來做飯，我上城里走一趟。</p>
<p>上了大街，店鋪都已歇業，街道上全是灰衣兵，就是有本地人，也是幫着抬扛物件的。我擠進了每天常到的茶樓，除幾個老茶客外，全被兵士佔了，掌爐的根福勉强　了　頭　一個兵談話。我這過去用比較純熟的北　　　　　　的情形，那兵士反給我倒了杯茶，和氣的告訴我：前綫很勝利，可是前天晚上×號洋橋被炸了，我們長官審愼起見，把貴地作爲防綫，幾天之內沒有變動，　　　是漤退防，貴地是不能作大綫的丨開來了我們三千多兄弟已經沒有造飯的地方了！</p>
<p>最後他笑著問我：「怕嗎？」</p>
<p>「不開仗怕什麼呢！」說得他們都笑了。</p>
<h3 id="c303">大减價 <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>開了店鋪，希望主顧上門，在物品的一轉手間，將本求利，這種淺近的道理，原是大家知道的。所以登了大幅廣告說是大减價，不過告訴你們在這三星期的時期內他們的利息是打得薄一點。主顧當然是貪便宜的，兩家烟兌店往往爲了市面上一枚銅元上落，努力競爭起來，這雖附帶着鬥氣問題，終究還是爲了營業關係。記得從前大减價的廣告一登出來，外埠的主顧也有不遠千里而來採辦貨物的。每年的四季大减價及一次×週紀念，大半商店做着好生意的。這就是薄利多賣主義了，在商店與顧客是兩得其便。最近二年來，普通大减價已失去了原有的號召力，於是互相標榜買一送一，半價，及汽車巨獎等贈券來維持營業，而大减價幾乎是終年舉行着了。然而一看上海最大的百貨商塲，顧客上門還是寥寥無幾。我們不問他們的價目是否犧牲血本，或者打得一點更微薄的利息，在如此大宣傳下的「營業」都不見起色；這原因不在營業的本身，而在顧客方面購買力的低落是顯而易見的。然則拼命在「大减價」上兜圈子，豈能維持這將要破產的局面！</p>
<h3 id="c304">霧 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>霧是美麗的！</p>
<p>早上起來，見窗外是白茫茫地，疑心是下雨了。打開窗一望，却原來是一片乳白色的大霧，把整個的田野都遮沒了，一些東西都瞧不出來。</p>
<p>洗過了臉，覺得閑着沒事，於是把椅子移到窗邊，兩雙手握着一杯熱茶，邊喝邊瞧那美麗的霧，幾乎看得把自己都忘了。</p>
<p>歇了不久，濃厚的霧漸漸的退成稀薄的了，距離近一些的房屋和樹木都可以模模糊糊的看見。在那霧下行走的人好像在雲裏似的，如果我不感到手裏有些燙熱的活，我眞會疑心我自己是在雲端裏住着一樣的。</p>
<p>不久，霧又薄一些了，較遠一些的東西也能辨見。遠處的樹木只可以看見一個頂尖，一堆堆地，好像海島似的。正在那時候，溫和的太陽光射進來了，把乳白的霧加上一層紅色，那遠處露出的樹尖也披上了一件金黃色的衫兒，亮晶晶地，像一個窈窕的少女的頰，却又像一面打碎了的鏡子。</p>
<p>再過些時，霧全退了，天空是一團極可愛的蔚藍色，田野像洗刷過一樣，淸晰而動人。</p>
<p>霧是美麗的！</p>

<h3 id="c313">愛麗絲費談好萊塢的誘惑種種（下） <a href="#c313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>以上所說的，都是攝影塲以外的誘惑，但是還有許多誘惑，是和攝影工作有直接關係的，等到你得到了一個機遇，無論是臨時演員，或是小角色，或是已經得到了一張小合同之後</p>
<p>電影工作對於演員們有一個特別的要求，就是要守時刻。在好萊塢，凡是在電影事業中工作的，都要謹守「早睡早起」的規律。但是那裏有許多誘惑力，時時叫你去破壞那種規律。你須知道，歌舞女子是可以睡得晚些起來的，所以晚上遲睡些，亦不要緊的，但是電影演員却不成。因爲凡是做電影演員的，每天早晨一定要六點半起床，至遲七點鐘。她們起床之後，還要修飾化妝等等，都是很費時間的，而攝影工作却是從早晨八時半，或九時，就要開始的。</p>
<p>在電影塲裏工作的人，每天至少要睡八小時。倘使你到了相當重要的地位，必須作表演工作，或是要拍面部表情的時候，你一定要有貯藝豐富的精力，才能够表演生動，精神飽滿。那是衹有充足的睡眠，才可以給你的。在鏡頭前，些少的精神委頓，都會顯示出來的。但是俏使你沒有至重要的地位，你亦沒有什面部表情可作，那末，八小時的睡眠是尤其必需的，因爲你一定要處處顯露着你的精神，無論在鏡前，或是待人接物的時候，好使攝影塲上一切的人，無論是攝製家，導演，攝影師，或是其他一切工作的人，都對於你生一個好印象。</p>
<p>攝影師的眼睛，最爲尖銳。他對人臉上一望，就知道你拍得好不好。他尖銳的眼光，早就看出了你昨天晚上出去玩了沒有，遲睡或失眠了沒有。所以，無論如何，在早晨六時以前，你一定要設法得到八小時的充份睡眠。那就是說，你晚上十點鐘，一定要上床的。當然，有些時候晚睡是不能避免的。璧如拍夜景，試片子等等，都是必需晚上做的工作，但是，你總要設法補足。不然的話，你將來要後悔的。但是好萊塢的誘惑亦就在這個地方作祟起來了。加利福尼亞的日光。固然有一種特殊的魔力，使人們不願意留在戶內，但是加利福尼亞的夜和夜生活，亦是同樣富有誘惑性的。好萊塢的夜生活，雖然和紐約不同，沒有像紐約的夜總會那麼多，但是影界裏面的種種應酬的繁多，亦就很可觀了。他們在家裏開著宴會，在飯店，在酒館，跳舞廳，劇院等等，欵待着朋友同事們，可以總是日無虛夕的。</p>
<p>這裏，你要明白，他們這般出來應酬的明星們，他們都是在「片間」Between　pictures就是在演完了一張，還沒有演第二張，其中的一段休息期間之中的。他們利用這片間的假期，來遊蕩應酬，但你却正在工作之中，或是應當努力尋找工作的時候，你怎麼能去舍己芸人呢？你以爲去應酬一下，坐了一回就可以回來的，但是旣到了那裏，是很難目脫身的，要是你沒有堅决的意志的話，結果，你失去了你所應得的睡眠了。不久，你就覺得這種無謂的應酬，是不値得的。但是，那亦不是重視職業的好萊塢所欲强迫你的。俏使你坐了一回，站了起來來說：「我明天有早班，要先走一步。」他們都明白了，不會不原諒你的。因爲他們所知攝影塲的工作規章，是最注重時間的。</p>
<p>還有一個更不好的誘惑，那就是天天看影戲。你常常自己璧解：「這是爲我自己工作起見。」但是不久，你亦就犯了少眠之症了。因爲你下午六時離開攝塲，吃晚飯，換衣服，看一切値得看的影片，你就不能在十點鐘上床了。努力勤學，當然不能說是誘惑之一種的，但是初到好萊塢的愛好女子，最易犯的危險，就是攝影塲以外的工作過多，自己操練過于刻苦。你往往不願意放棄你的歌舞練習，往往還要練着語言和戲劇。當然，那都是爲前途所必需的一種準備，但是你一定要知道限制。所謂「過猶不及」體康實爲萬事之本也。</p>
<p>此外，還有許多小誘惑，而是女演員們必需避免的。第一不要做作（在攝影塲以外。）一舉一動，做去你是個女伶的樣子，在無論何地，都會被人家討厭的。好萊塢亦不是例外。還有，你得到了一些成功之後，切不可自命不凡的驕矜起來。你讀了報紙上稱讚你的你，你不可以爲當之無愧的了。</p>
<p>愛麗費所說的話，當然對於好萊塢一般初進女明星是很有帮助。但是我們上海的電影從業者，亦未始不可稍加思索，當作及時的忠告也。</p>

<h3 id="c314">評「生活」 <a href="#c314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｏur　Daily　Bread丨大光明</p>
<p>金維多（King　Vidor),這一偉大的美國作家，從他過去的作品中，他已經給與人們深刻的印象，關於他，我們從他的生活中來窺探他的作風，最爲適當。他曾經經歷過艱苦的行程，從他自己以至於他們同伴的貧窮的生活中，他體念出人與人之間互助的精神和偉大的愛。出現在他作品中的人物，當是質樸而忠厚的好人。同時他所描寫的壞人，也不是絕對的壞，而是繪畫他們滑稽相。</p>
<p>在他的作品中，通常可以領受到的是重厚的田園風味，所以他相對的認爲都市總是罪惡之數。然而他所創作的主人公，雖有時亦爲惡劣環境所動，而走入岐途，但最後金維多到底使他理智的覺醒過來。</p>
<p>不錯，金維多是理想主義者。這由於他接觸了許多人世的悲哀，他對於現實社會不能不表示不滿，然而他不能更深切的體念社會現象的根原，只憑着自己的自信力，和惡社會掙扎着。於是發揮了他的互助，博愛的人性，從殘酷的現實中企求理想的安慰。</p>
<p>關於他過去的作品，如默片的「鶴立雞羣」，聲片的「戰地之花」，「歸去來兮」等等，都一貫的表現着如上所述的作風，現在我們必須說到的便是對於他自己編劇的「生活」的檢討。</p>
<p>在這裏他是以失業問題爲主題，而且企圖解决這一嚴重的社會問題，於是他使一羣失業者開墾荒地。在這裏有着各色各樣的失業者，有藝術家，也有逃獄的囚犯。在這生活集團中，他們彼此互助，博愛，共同工作，共同吃飯，共同生活着。他們中間互相了解，互相溶洽，無所謂仇讐，也無謂恩怨。更明確的表現着，男主人公雖然一時被誘於金錢和女色，拋棄原來的妻子，脫離集團，可是不久便覺悟過來，努力參加救旱工作。當然，在這裏充分的表現着他的偉大的理想。可是他的精神，他的偉大的愛，却給與人們極大的安慰，當人們在現實中感受極度苦悶時候。我們在金維多要求百分之一日的現實表現是不可能的，然而他對於人類的同情却是充滿了在他的作品之中。</p>
<p>更進一步的，我們約略的來觀察他是用怎樣的技巧來完成他的「生活」。出身於攝影塲小工的他，對於制片技術之純熟的運用，自然是無疵可指的。譬如說他絕對不用無謂的噱頭，但是如寫男主人公以琴換雞，那商人的態度却十分可笑，而這商人的性格也活生生的描畫出來。同樣輕描淡寫的素描中，主人公夫婦在農塲舊屋中安睡的情景，也是十分輕妙和諧。不過他的長處並不在此，主要的是他一點也不鬆懈的描寫了人羣的生活。持別是從男主人公回來之後，立刻捲起高潮，那無論是在音樂效果上或者是鏡頭的角度上，都達到了完美的境地。至於調子的調和，靜與動的適當的支配，而男主人公偕情人私逃的離家之前，當時的空氣和女主人公無言的悲哀，他都是把握得很好的。總之，這一影片是應當得着較高評價的。</p>
<h3 id="c315">評「茀姬遺恨」 <a href="#c315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>The　Life　of　Veigie　Winters　丨太上海峽</p>
<p>這是張老調的戀愛至上主義的影片</p>
<p>魯易司，勃龍飛地（Louis　Bromfie'd)這一作家，在這「茀姬遺恨中」給我們認識他，不論在題材的抓取，表現的手法，以及由於創作態度所顯示出的世界觀上，都是比較保守與陳舊的。</p>
<p>他寫茀姬溫特被人中傷，不得與所愛者結婚，而她那「係出世家」的約翰另外去娶了一個叫洛拉的女人回來後，又與她恢復了舊好。</p>
<p>約翰要離了婚來和她舉行婚禮時，她却勸他爲前途努力。在這期間，私生了一個女兒。</p>
<p>跟着時光的進展，約翰的社會地位已經相當的高了，同時茀姬的恨也跟着深下去，她爲了愛，終於忍受着。</p>
<p>女兒大到也會和人家講戀愛了，洛拉强迫約翰宣佈她的出身，於是這一悲劇展了開去，</p>
<p>功成名就的約翰說是再也不能長此「讓這悲劇繼續下去了」，决然地要讓茀姬取得妻與母的身分時，爲洛拉開槍打死，茀姬因嫌被捕。演成了「此恨綿綿無當時」。</p>
<p>這裏，作者借茀姬的嘴，對約翰說着：「我除了你的愛情，什麼都不要，我寗願生活在人生的陰面。這樣澈頭澈尾，唯愛觀的作者，我們對他還作什麼要求呢？</p>
<p>編劇者也許是未能擺脫原著的關係，全劇較爲散漫，沉悶。特別是前半段，從茀姬在牢獄的窗前看着約翰的出殯，開始回憶起，直到約翰的參加競選，自己生女兒止，這一段，未免零亂。從一九一四至一九三二的時間表現，全用報頭的插入，顯着極單調。買帽子的貴婦人們的一再來去，也缺少變化。</p>
<p>演員以Ann　Harding較好，她那種充滿着人生澀味的悲劇的演出，很足相當地打動觀衆的。演約翰的John　Boles,該是大有發揮的。可惜他不會做到應有的成績。</p>

<p>— 兆初</p>
<p>馮雲山這時正在演講，圍着聽的有十多個人。許二哥怱推門進來，見了馮雲山，趕緊上面拉着，低聲說了幾句，馮聽了他的說話，立時變色，倉惶的叫衆人散去。自己亦就連忙到洪家去報信。這時洪秀全同妻賴氏正並立廊下，看着妹子洪宣嬌練武藝。忽地馮雲山氣喘喘奔了進來，口裏喊着：「洪大哥在裏？」宣嬌住了拳，秀全迎了上去，忙問什麼事，馮急忙的說道：「縣裏已經派人來捉我們了，趕快想法逃走呀。」洪聽了，反呆住了，失了主意。馮又催着說：「快些走，捉的人已出來了。」</p>
<p>一班如狼似虎的差役，橫衝直撞，直至上帝會門口，叩門沒有人承應，打門進去，撲了一個空。他們齊聲喊道：「我們趕快到洪家去捉人。」大家又蜂擁了過去。這時洪秀全，馮雲山，洪妻賴氏和宣嬌等已經逃了出來。賴氏宣嬌換了鄉婦打扮，各自提了一個包裹。洪對賴氏妹妹說道：「現在你們衹得鄉下去，暫遜幾時，等我們有了妥當的地方，再來給信你們。賴氏還扯着秀全，要想說什麼。秀全連連說道：「這兒不是說話的時候。隨後聽我的信罷。」說着開了後園小門，走了出去。</p>
<p>衆差役奔了來，分向各屋內搜尋無着，仍又聚在庭院內。旣而捉了一個老傭人出來，那老傭人嚇得喪魂失魄，差人們問他洪秀全躱在那裏，快說出來。老傭人發抖的回答說：「求老爺放了我，我實在不知。」差人們大怒，用拳毆打。這時忽有一人奔了來報告說：「我看見洪秀全和一個人騎了馬，向北逃走了。」衆人聽了，蜂擁似的追去。且說洪馮二人騎在馬上，急速奔去，洪說：「我們現在還是向廣西一路去吧！」說着，二人加鞭飛馬，轉瞬不見。差役們十五六人，騎馬仗刀，飛奔至近郊野外，他們都勒住了馬韁，四向瞻望，互相商議，往何處追尋。結果分爲二批，兩面兜尋。洪馮見後面有追兵，更加鞭奔去，到了河邊，衹得沿河而走。一隊人馬已迎面繞道而至。又一隊人馬亦已追至河邊，亦沿河邊前追。洪馮二人，見前後均有追兵，大爲驚惶，忽生急智，洪隨即向馮說：「我們衹有這條死裏逃生的計策了，」說着，二人趕即下了馬，在馬後各打了一鞭，二馬奔去，二人各把帽子靴子拋棄在河裏，自己沿着河邊草叢裏逃走。臨走又拋下幾塊大石，河面上起了紊亂的水紋。甲乙二隊先後遇合。有人已經抓住洪馮二人的逃馬，但尋不到二人。後有人看見河面上浮着二人的帽子靴子，當時各人均紛紛談議起來。還有人拾了石子，擲到河裏，探視虛實。結果那差人說道：「恐怕是情急投河死了。這也只得罷了。」說着，各人亦各自上馬，沒精打彩的回去。這邊洪馮二人，在蘆草從裏偷偷看着，馮道：「今天真的太險了！差一點落在他們手裏。」洪秀全聽了，反而　氣說：「可憐他們也是漢人，何苦要把我們逼到這個地步呢！」（未完）</p>

<p>Planes Dropped Several Bombs Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Artillery Fired Over Forty Shells</p>
<p>Infantry Advancing Towards the Great Wall Line</p>
<p>Peiping Authorities Negotiating with the Japanese Side</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou Telegram: Yesterday evening, a Japanese regiment of about 1,500 troops arrived in Datang. Carrying artillery and machine guns, they concentrated that night in the Longtanmiao and Sidaogou area, and began to pressure our Great Wall line. All areas east of the Great Wall, belonging to Guyuan County, have no troops stationed there, and local order is maintained only by the militia. This afternoon, four Japanese aircraft, under the cover of infantry, cavalry, and artillery units, continued to attack our Dushikou Great Wall line. Japanese aircraft also continuously dropped bombs in the Dongzhaizi area, bombing civilian houses, destroying a total of eleven locations. At 3:00 PM, Japanese aircraft returned to Dongzhaizi to reconnoiter and drop bombs. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou Telegram: About a battalion of puppet troops arrived at Heidouyingzi, 60 li from Yanqing, on the 18th. Their rifles are Type 38. About a battalion of puppet troops, about 400 to 500 men, arrived at Huapen, 100 li from Yanqing. Their rifles are also Type 38. On the 20th, about 1,000 Japanese and puppet troops arrived in the Dage area, declaring that they would start attacking the Guyuan and Dushikou area on the 23rd and 24th. Today, Japanese aircraft flew over Chahar to drop bombs and distributed the Kwantung Army's declaration. The content pointed out that the first, second, third, and fourth districts of Guyuan had accepted the "Kingly Way Administration" of the puppet Manchukuo. (According to reports, there are only militia in Datang and Changle, and no national troops are stationed.) Therefore, the Kwantung Army decided to take decisive action with the main force of the Rehe Provincial Corps and part of the air force. The wording in the declaration is extremely absurd. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 21st, a Japanese aircraft flew to Changliang and Wunihe, reconnoitering along the outside of the Great Wall line, and arrived over Guyuan County, circling and flying low several times.

<p>(Beiping) The Chahar East issue has been quite calm for days. At about 6:00 PM on the 22nd, the Japanese suddenly sent infantry, artillery, and air force to attack simultaneously, and the situation is serious. On the morning and evening of the 23rd, Xiao Zhenying received phone calls from the Zhangjiakou Provincial Government twice, stating that two days ago, the Japanese side requested the provincial government to send one person and the Guyuan County magistrate to discuss the Chahar East issue. The provincial government was preparing to send one section chief from Guyuan County and one representative from the province to handle it. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 22nd, more than a thousand Japanese infantry and artillery, two to three thousand puppet troops, more than ten armored vehicles, and more than twenty artillery pieces attacked Dushikou, Guyuan, Dongwunihe, and Changliang simultaneously and have not stopped attacking. On the morning of the 23rd, Japanese and puppet infantry and artillery continued to fire. At 10:00 AM, four Japanese aircraft dropped eleven bombs on Dongzhaizi. At 11:00 AM, they fired 41 shells at the same location. As of 4:30 PM, it had not stopped. One route of Japanese troops has attacked Guyuan, and another is near Dushikou.

<p>(Beiping) According to reliable news from Zhangjiakou received by Chinese sources tonight, the war in Chahar Province was still going on at 4:00 PM today. Guyuan and Dongzhaizi were both attacked, and Dushikou was also bombed by Japanese aircraft and artillery. According to news received by officials here, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army launched an unprovoked attack on the Chinese army withdrawing from a corner of the area claimed by the Kwantung Army to belong to Rehe Province at 6:00 PM last night, and the war broke out. A thousand Japanese "Manchukuo" soldiers, carrying armored vehicles and twenty field guns, simultaneously attacked Dushikou, Guyuan, and Dongzhaizi. The Chinese army in Guyuan and Dushikou resisted, and the battle lasted until 10:00 AM this morning. Seven Japanese aircraft flew over Dushikou in the morning, dropping many bombs. The Japanese "Manchukuo" army then mobilized artillery to the front and began to bombard Dushikou fiercely. At noon today, four Japanese aircraft flew over Guyuan but did not drop bombs. According to the latest news received here, the battle of Guyuan and Dushikou was still going on at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The news of the Japanese "Manchukuo" army's attack caused great panic here, because no Chinese troops are stationed in Dongzhaizi, and Guyuan and Dushikou are both outside the area claimed by the Japanese as part of Rehe Province. The losses on both sides are still unknown. The Japanese army suddenly took the offensive when the boundary dispute was being resolved peacefully here, so the people here are very angry. The whole city is now very tense. The war is caused by only fragments of news coming from Zhangjiakou, leading to rumors and no one knowing the truth. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Aims to Sever Communication Between China and Russia</p>
<p>One Theory is Coveting the Gold Mines in the Disputed Territory</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian published an editorial today commenting on the Kwantung Army's encroachment on Chahar. It said that when Duolun was occupied by Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops, Japan could not speak of the "natural boundary line" or the military interests of the Great Wall as it did last year. It is noteworthy that the Chinese government denied the activities of Chinese militia in the disputed territory. Some believe that Japan's move this time is coveting the gold mines in the disputed territory, while the general public believes that it aims to sever communication between China and Russia.

Eleven guards successively entered the water to rescue him, but all drowned. After Xiao's remains were recovered, they were transported back for burial. The entire division mourned. All units continued to advance and search and suppress as usual. Deputy Division Commander Huang Maoru temporarily replaced the division commander. On the evening of the 22nd, Wang Jingjiu, the commander of the 12th Security District, and Shi Honglie went to investigate and handle the aftermath. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Hirota Diplomacy and Sino-Japanese Relations <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Since Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota Koki took office, he has advocated "moral diplomacy" and a "good neighbor policy." He has expressed a desire to turn hostility into friendship with China, the United States, as well as Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries. At the opening of the 67th regular session of the Diet, Hirota reiterated this intention in his speech on diplomatic policy. In practice, he has expressed goodwill towards Britain and the United States, emphasizing diplomatic negotiations in order to gradually stabilize the situation in the Far East. However, what deserves our full attention is the relationship between China and Japan. Hirota believes that it has gradually improved and hopes that it will continue to do so in the long term, repeatedly expressing his desire for mutual understanding between China and Japan. From this, we can further understand the intention of Japanese diplomacy.</p>
<p>The relationship between China and Japan is inseparable in terms of geography and the historical relationship of the past sixty years. This connection is indeed complex and more so than that between European countries. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated Pan-Asianism, and enlightened Japanese figures such as Taro Katsura also admired and believed in it. However, the most important point of Dr. Sun's teachings and what China upholds today is the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation, and the removal of all unreasonable constraints. Therefore, the establishment of a good relationship between China and Japan first requires mutual respect for national interests. In other words, it means promoting friendship without undermining our national independence and freedom. Second, it requires positive contributions to a peaceful future. Our country is especially willing to make its greatest efforts to seek the correction of Sino-Japanese relations. What will happen in the future depends on Japan's sincerity.</p>
<p>Hirota's so-called moral diplomacy can indeed make a significant contribution to peaceful and friendly relations between China and Japan. There has been some progress since last year. If Japan can continue to work hard with this intention, without infringing on our national interests or hindering our national independence and freedom, then our government and people should not hesitate to join hands with sincerity to jointly maintain peace in the Far East. Like France and Germany, the historical origins of their animosity run deep and are not easy to resolve. However, France was able to maintain the magnanimity of a great power and patiently await the results of the Saarland plebiscite, allowing the League of Nations to make a goodwill decision. The volatile situation in Europe was thus temporarily stabilized, and the opposition between France and Germany was also eased. Although there are also extremely unfair grievances between China and Japan, compared to Germany and France, they are not as deep. Improvement is possible, or even surpass them.</p>
<p>Moreover, the situation of peace in Europe has gradually been established. The struggle for supremacy between France and Italy has gradually eased, and practical interests have found a way to be coordinated. As a result, the disputes in Central Europe and the competition in North Africa are showing a glimmer of hope. The reconstruction of friendly international relations is underway. As for the Naval Disarmament Conference, during the preparatory meeting, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan insisted on their fundamental principles based on their own positions, making non-negotiable proposals, which led the Disarmament Conference into a deadlock. The future of the formal conference this year is certainly not optimistic. However, with the European situation stabilizing, mutual understanding between the United Kingdom and the United States is likely to increase suddenly, and the dark clouds floating over the Pacific are becoming thinner and thinner. The so-called international crisis may not be completely eliminated, but a considerable degree of reduction is inevitable. This cumulative trend is of utmost importance to the countries along the Pacific coast, and it makes a great contribution to China and Japan.</p>
<p>If Japan's diplomatic trend can live up to Hirota's expectations and not harm our national interests, continuing with peaceful efforts, then our country should uphold its long-standing commitment to maintaining peace and make its greatest efforts for international friendship. And China, as one of the major countries in the Pacific, should further reveal its sincerity and meet with Japan to engage in diplomatic negotiations, so that the dark clouds on the sea can be reduced, and international relations in the Far East can be improved, eliminating the so-called crisis and moving towards world peace. The key lies solely in Japan.</p>

(3) To propose revisions to the regulations for the determination of duplicated water names and water conservancy laws nationwide. (4) To unify the accounting methods of water conservancy organs nationwide and revise organizational regulations. (5) The Yellow River estuary should be dredged as soon as possible. (6) For cases where various water conservancy organs and provincial governments request funds for water conservancy projects, after research by the technical personnel in charge of various water conservancy organs and on-site inspections by League of Nations experts, the amount of funds required for the 23rd year was determined and a list of water conservancy projects to be undertaken in the 23rd year was compiled.

Japan's policy towards China disregards the Nine-Power Treaty and is well known. I believe that Japan's attitude is not only related to peace in the Pacific, but also to world peace.

<p>Opposes Postponement of Formal Conference</p>
<p>Issues Declaration Before Departure</p>
<p>(London) Japanese Chief Expert on Naval Talks, Rear Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, will leave here and return home no later than Tuesday next week. Before his departure, he issued a declaration, saying that the naval conference stipulated in the London and Washington Naval Treaties must be held as soon as possible within the shortest period of time. This is Japan's wish. I originally intended to return home via the United States, but now I have changed my itinerary and returned home via Siberia due to government orders to rush back to the country. If the Japanese government does not want the naval conference to be held as soon as possible, then I expect that it will never order me to rush back to the country. Therefore, I believe that even if someone proposes to postpone the naval conference to 1936, Japan will not accept it. Another expert member of the Japanese delegation, Colonel Iwashita, is scheduled to return home via the United States tomorrow. However, Japanese sources in London claim that Iwashita's trip to the United States is only a social matter, and Iwashita will not hold any formal negotiations in the United States.

<p>Trampling on Human Rights, Pursuing the Responsibility of the Minister of Justice</p>
<p>Problems with Discipline, Yamaguchi Forces Togi to Act</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai's strategy was that on the second day, Yamaguchi Giichi took the stage in the House of Representatives to question the human rights issue, Takahashi Kumajiro questioned the rural issue, and Iwasaki Koji郎 questioned the ideological education and social policy issue. In short, this meeting is only a preliminary battle, and its main force should be poured into the budget general meeting, because it wants to determine the outcome in the budget deliberations, so it recognizes the trend of the bomb motion. Judging from the atmosphere on the first day, optimism can be held for lack of understanding. (23rd Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's plenary session of the House of Peers opened at 10:16 am and immediately entered the agenda, continuing to question the ministers of state. Dr. Minobe, who does not belong to any party, took the stage to discuss the Constitution and questioned Minister of Justice Ohara on the issue of trampling on human rights, saying that the Ministry of Justice abused its power when investigating the Teijin incident and trampled on the law, which is appalling. If based on the principles of human rights and freedom under the Constitution, if there are facts such as illegal detention and torture, it constitutes a crime by the prosecutor. He then stated that during the Teijin incident, whether there were illegal arrests, detentions, and illegal investigations as rumored, and if so, it would constitute malfeasance by judicial officers, so he would like to hear the government's views. Later, he included a discussion of the facts and read aloud Mr. Shimada's diary in prison, exposing the fact that leather handcuffs were used during torture. Minister of Justice Ohara then took the stage to answer, denying that the prosecutor's office had taken improper measures, and said that there were no facts of prosecutors illegally detaining people. As for the detention issue, he said that he would reply after investigation. He further stated that if the facts as stated by the doctor were found, the persons involved would be severely punished. Finally, Dr. Minobe questioned on the spot, and the meeting adjourned at 0:05 am. (23rd Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Dr. Minobe raised the issue of trampling on human rights in the House of Peers today, attacking the illegal actions of the prosecutor's office from a legal standpoint and pursuing the responsibility of Minister of Justice Ohara.

Dr. Iwata Chuzo in the House of Peers and Sanji Tadashi, the central figure in this case, in the House of Representatives, are still questioning. How the future will be is attracting much attention from all parties. (23rd Nippon News Alliance Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives meeting opened at 1:15 pm on the 23rd. The situation was very lively with more people in the gallery than the designated number. Today, the ministers of state continued to be questioned regarding their speeches. First, Mr. Yamaguchi Giichi took the stage amidst cheers, saying that he had to raise questions about the issue of discipline of the current cabinet. The statement was then made as follows:</p>
<p>The previous Saito cabinet collapsed due to the issue of discipline, and the current cabinet has also experienced a similar collapse. Investigating this matter is quite related to the prestige of the country, so I will now question the issue of discipline. According to rumors, the Okada cabinet has already reviewed the qualities and character of the people entering the cabinet in advance, but there are still some cabinet members with question marks, and the Okada cabinet should bear a double responsibility for this. I am now asking Minister Togi the following questions:</p>
<p>When Mr. Togi traveled to China in the autumn of Showa 3, he expressed different views on the administration and China policy and issued a statement. At that time, the Tanaka cabinet adopted a tough policy towards China, and Zhang Xueliang incited an anti-Japanese movement at this time. If Mr. Togi had the same opinion as the Tanaka cabinet at that time, he would not have met with Zhang Xueliang. Mr. Togi's actions at that time were at least an agreement to ease Japan's tough policy towards China.</p>
<p>Minister Togi replied as follows:</p>
<p>I express my gratitude for Mr. Yamaguchi's intimacy, but his remarks are mostly hypothetical. My trip to China was indeed in December of Showa 3. Because many pending issues between the two countries were delayed at that time, I made this trip from South China to Shenyang for on-the-spot observation, and met with Zhang Xueliang. After returning to China, the opinions I expressed were to request recognition of the Nanjing government and withdraw the troops from Jinan. The above claims were discussed with the Tanaka cabinet and were agreed to. My opinions can be said to have been exhausted for the sake of my country, and I still believe in them. With this loyalty to the emperor and patriotism, how can I be tempted by money? In general, you can only comment after knowing what kind of person he is. Please do not speak recklessly. As for the matter of the Youth Officers' Association issuing any printed materials, I have heard of it but have not seen it. I don't need to be an opponent of those who hide their names. If anyone is my opponent, please state your name and come, and I hope that those who come will be prepared in advance. This matter was exposed since the establishment of the Inukai cabinet. I really don't want to defend it. Even if it is clarified or not, those who believe will believe it, and those who do not believe will still not believe it. Mr. Yamaguchi's so-called other rumors are not included. I hope you will not be polite and publish as much as possible. As for the various rumors of confusion and nonsense, please do not bring them to the parliament.</p>
<p>After Minister Togi gave the above earnest teachings and stepped down leisurely amidst the cheers of the Minsei Party, Mr. Yamaguchi immediately took the stage again to add the following arguments:</p>
<p>The person who issued the printed materials is an official of the Ministry of the Army, an army major. Therefore, in order to show integrity, it should be requested to cancel it, or sue for defamation, otherwise the doubts of the people cannot be eliminated.</p>
<p>Minister Togi replied as follows:</p>
<p>I have already said everything in my reply just now. The means of expressing innocence, or should be as Mr. Yamaguchi talked about, is also unknown. But whether to take it is my freedom.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Takahashi Kumajiro questioned Minister of Interior Goto and Minister of the Army Hayashi, focusing on the problem of rural relief. (23rd Nippon News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Councillor Yamaguchi Giichi's sharp questions were unexpectedly overwhelmed by Minister Togi. However, it is heard that the reason why Mr. Yamaguchi raised this issue to deal with Mr. Togi was actually a purge within the Seiyukai. Some said that it was a deliberate challenge to the Togi faction, and others said that it instigated the military to create a rift with Mr. Togi. Various rumors are currently circulating, and it seems that there are many secrets, which is attracting much attention from the general public. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Japanese Propaganda to Italy <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Says the Far Eastern Market Has a Wide Range</p>
<p>Italy Has Plenty of Room to Develop Trade</p>
<p>(Rome) Japanese Ambassador to Italy Sugimura recently issued a declaration to the "Lecture Forum" reporter, stating the mutual relations between Italy and Japan in Africa and the Far East, saying that the rumor that Abyssinia has hired Japanese military instructors is false and completely inaccurate. As for the saying that Japan is developing economically in Abyssinia, most of it is that Jews in Kobe buy Japanese goods and transport them to the capital of Abyssinia, and Japanese goods are not directly imported into Abyssinia. Mentioning the Far East, Sugimura said that I believe that Italy can develop its trade in the Far East and will not be involved with Japan at all, because the Far Eastern market is very large and there is plenty of room for development. However, in order to develop trade, the most important thing is to make the people of the Far East gain peace and tranquility. Japan's policy is aimed at this, and the result will surely satisfy all countries. Finally, the Japanese ambassador distributed samples of Japanese goods for experts to study, and said that if Japan can sign reciprocal tax regulations with Italy and import wine from Italy, it would be a great pleasure.

<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas predicted today that after the Supreme Court announces its verdict on the gold bond case, the Senate will intensify its efforts to promote the reminting of silver coins and the establishment of a central bank. Thomas declared that the Federal Reserve Board is currently studying a draft of the new banking law, and the Senate's Agriculture Committee plans to consider the Weller's proposal to remint silver coins at a ratio of sixteen to one after the Supreme Court announces its verdict. Thomas said that since the beginning of the currency reform movement, the government has obtained 4,000,000,000 yuan worth of gold, and the bankers and other people who handed over the gold hope that the Treasury will return the profit. The reason why we are interested in establishing a central bank is this. If commercial banks cannot lend funds to industry and commerce, then there will soon be a request for government assistance.

<p>Isolation Policy of Past Years Will Change</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the United States' participation in the Hague World Court, government leaders held a secret vote in the Senate, and the result was 60 people in favor, which is more than a two-thirds majority. The Senate has been debating this matter for a week, and the strongest opposition was from Democratic Senator Reynolds. Reynolds called the World Court a "conspiracy court" and said that there is no real war crisis between the United States and Japan. The reason why Britain wants the United States to join the League of Nations is simply because Japan has invaded its textile market. Reynolds continued, Japan threatened the whole world a few years ago, but since the Soviet Russia mobilized, Japan has changed its attitude. Japan is actually an overhyped country in the world. In terms of war, if Japan wants to compete with the United States, it is no different from a cat-and-mouse game. Reynolds finally said that Japan will eventually attempt to invade Australia.

<p>(Washington) The last obstacle to the United States' participation in the Hague International Court of Justice has now been eliminated, and it can now be considered certain that a necessary step has been taken to submit international legal disputes to arbitration. The Senate leaders discussed at today's meeting the reservation conditions regarding the United States' participation in the International Court of Justice proposed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The debate was quite intense, and the vote finally decided to adopt it. This security case stipulates that the United States' participation in the International Court of Justice does not involve the internal affairs of other countries, nor does it abandon the United States' absolute power to handle purely internal affairs. The Senate leaders' actions today were due to President Roosevelt's consultation with Congress to approve the United States' participation in the International Court of Justice for the benefit of peace. The isolation policy that the United States has adhered to for more than ten years will change from now on. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Sofia: King Boris of Bulgaria's political opponents planned to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. The King received secret intelligence and swiftly reorganized the entire cabinet, dismissing all Republican members. The King has now emerged victorious in the political turmoil. Prime Minister Mushanov submitted his resignation yesterday, which the King promptly accepted, appointing Minister of War Tsira Taev to reorganize the cabinet. Tsira Taev presented the new cabinet list within three hours, consisting almost entirely of military personnel, with no Republicans included. Tsira Taev will concurrently serve as Minister of War in the new cabinet. Colonel Kolov will be Minister of Interior, General Ratev will be Minister of Education, and Colonel Kalendarev will be Minister of Justice and temporarily Minister of Finance. The three non-military members are Foreign Minister Batev, Minister of Economy Morov, and Minister of Transportation Chai Torov, all of whom held their previous positions. The public seems to be very supportive of the new cabinet. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Sofia: Four members of the new cabinet served in the previous cabinet, including Prime Minister Tsira Taev. He held important positions in the military and joined the Georgiev cabinet as Minister of War on May 19th of last year. The new cabinet will continue to implement the policies established by the previous cabinet, supported by various professional and patriotic organizations, striving to enhance national authority and continue the previous foreign policy.

<p>Madrid: The issue of a partial reorganization of the Spanish cabinet, after weeks of discussion, has finally come to an end. Naval Minister Roger, a member of the Radical Party, had been serving as Acting Foreign Minister for two months. He has now been formally appointed, and another Radical Party member, Kant, has succeeded him as Naval Minister. All other cabinet members remain in their positions, but the Radical Party's influence has greatly increased. Although the Catholic and Agrarian parties requested more seats in the cabinet, they have not yet been successful. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Arranging Loans and Safeguarding Independence</p>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, accompanied by Foreign Minister Weidiger, will come to London before the end of February at the suggestion of the Austrian cabinet. The purpose of the Austrian Chancellor and Foreign Minister's trip is to resolve certain issues regarding the arrangement of Austrian loans issued by the League of Nations and to express gratitude for Britain's concern about Austrian affairs. It is generally believed that the talks will also address the necessity of implementing the clauses on safeguarding Austria's independence in the Rome Accords of France and Italy as soon as possible. The Austrian cabinet is deeply concerned that the results of the Saar plebiscite will affect Germany's foreign policy. Generally, people do not believe that the Austrian Chancellor will mention the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy during his visit to London, as the peace treaty prohibits the restoration of the Austrian monarchy, and the current Austrian government still has obligations. As for the British side, it remains steadfast in affirming the maintenance of Austria's independence, with political figures generally considering Austrian independence as a key element of European stability.

<p>(London) According to government sources, French Prime Minister Flandin will arrive here on the 31st of this month to discuss stabilizing the relationship between the British pound and the French franc. The Treasury is currently preparing documents for the reference of Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, making this statement more credible. It is also known that the French Prime Minister will not be accompanied by financial experts on this trip, so Flandin will consider this issue separately with Chamberlain. However, the Department of Trade has doubts about conducting negotiations at this time, and financial figures are also not optimistic. The negotiations between the British and French authorities will be exploratory in nature and are not expected to result in any concrete decisions. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Paris) Minister without Portfolio Herriot and Minister of Interior Dienain submitted a report to the cabinet today, revealing that anti-Hitler elements in the Saar region are fleeing en masse. Since the people's vote on January 13th deciding that the Saar belongs to Germany, 8,000 people have fled into French territory. Military experts believe that the Saar region is a dangerous place. After the transfer of control to Germany on March 1st, it will pose a significant problem for France's security. However, most French politicians and diplomats believe that the Saar's return to Germany may gradually improve future negotiations and stabilize a Europe riddled with mutual suspicion. French military personnel do not share this view, as they see the Saar as nothing more than a constant threat along the French border. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>It is Difficult to Remain Silent on the Illegal Sale by Japan and Russia</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Rumors of the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway have been circulating for a long time. On the 22nd, a Japanese telegram revealed the fact that a draft agreement had been reached. Japan and Russia have been discussing this illegal sale for one year and seven months, holding a total of 40 talks. Currently, Nishiharu of Japan, Kozlovsky of Russia, and Ohashi, Vice-Minister of the Manchukuo Foreign Ministry, are serving as committee members, organizing a drafting committee, which is in effect drafting a formal agreement. Concerning our national sovereignty, we naturally cannot recognize this illegal sale. According to diplomatic sources, our government has been paying close attention to this matter. Many of the details reported are one-sided accounts from the Japanese side. Whether the situation is truly as described is still awaiting confirmation from various reports. If this illegal sale is concluded, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a solemn declaration to safeguard sovereignty, affirm our stance, and urge attention. It is estimated that reports from all parties will arrive in Nanjing separately on the evening of the 23rd or the morning of the 24th. The statement from the National Government should be released on the 24th. (Special Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the establishment of negotiations for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, politically, it will have a great and positive impact on the relationship between the Soviet Union, Japan, and Manchuria, and the diplomatic unease between Japan and Russia can be completely eliminated. It can stimulate investment in Manchuria, and the South Manchuria Railway will have unified management of all railways in Manchuria from now on, making it easier to develop resources in northern Manchuria. Exports to Russia will definitely improve in the future, and two-thirds of the transfer price of the Eastern Railway will be paid in goods. Even the 46 million yuan in cash that should be paid will mostly be used to purchase goods, which will have a very positive impact on the Japanese industrial sector and heavy industry.

<p>French Officer Volunteered Result</p>
<p>(Paris) Details continue to emerge in the past 24 hours regarding the annihilation of French officer Perenna and others by the Somali between the French Somaliland and Abyssinian border. Perenna, only 25 years old, was leading 106 soldiers on patrol near Lake Abbe when he suddenly heard fighting nearby. It turned out that several members of the Asaimaras tribe had crossed the border to attack a squad of soldiers from the Issa tribe of Somalia. The Issa soldiers were gradually losing ground due to being outnumbered. Regardless of the danger, Perenna decided to assist the Issa tribe. Upon arriving at the battlefield, he saw that his troops were far outnumbered by the enemy, as there were at least 800 Asaimaras. Perenna and his men did not retreat and opened fire to join the battle. Although the enemy's attack was fierce, Perenna and his men defended bravely. After two hours, their ammunition gradually ran out. At this point, they could have retreated and saved many, but Perenna and his men refused to show weakness and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, knowing full well that they were unlikely to defeat them. Perenna led from the front and was therefore the first to be killed. The remaining soldiers were then annihilated. Ten of them died from head injuries. Upon hearing the alarm, the Djibouti government urgently dispatched a large number of police to the southwest border to surround and arrest the enemy. People in Paris praised Perenna's bravery. Colonial Minister Roland yesterday proposed awarding him the Cross of Honor. The government has already issued an order praising Perenna's bravery. However, one senior official said that Perenna's expedition to the battlefield with a small force was not prudent. The political circles see the Asaimaras' attack as an affair between two tribes. The French government has decided not to negotiate this matter with the Abyssinian government, as the Abyssinian government cannot be held responsible for these scattered bandit groups causing trouble within Ethiopian territory. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A foreign ministry spokesman declared today that France does not intend to lodge a formal protest with Abyssinia or the League of Nations regarding the massacre of one French officer, 18 soldiers, and 88 Somalis by nomadic tribes in Abyssinia. The foreign ministry most likely believes that this matter is purely an act of banditry and has no political nature. The responsible culprits are not under the jurisdiction of the Abyssinian King but belong to the Asaimara tribe, who are nomadic along the border between Abyssinia and French Somaliland and have uncertain whereabouts. Previous reports stated that France would protest to Abyssinia, demanding compensation and assurances that there would be no further intrusions into French territory. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Previous reports that French government official named Bonard and 16 soldiers and native followers were annihilated by rebel barbarians in French Somaliland near the Abyssinian border have now been confirmed. Today, the Abyssinian Deputy Consul in Paris met with reporters from Jianqiang Bao and stated that the rebels most likely belong to the Issa tribe. The Issa tribe has been causing trouble for many years and has put the region under great pressure. They are unpredictable and difficult to pacify. The disturbance caused by natives on the Italian colonial border last month was likely caused by the same tribe. They do not have firearms, and the weapons they usually use are broad-bladed knives about 20 inches long. They also use these weapons to annihilate their enemies, but they are erratic, and it is often impossible to track them down after the fact. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e53">French Government Plans to Issue New Treasury Bills <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Totaling 50 Billion Francs</p>
<p>Bill Submitted to Parliament</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet today submitted a financial bill stipulating that the issuance of short-term treasury bonds be increased from 100 billion francs to 150 billion francs. The bill explains that this measure is not a disguised policy of currency inflation but merely to facilitate financial operations so that the state and all economic sectors can benefit. Currently, the national treasury must not only bear the usual expenses but also various social and economic bills and special national defense expenses. Due to the recent economic panic and reduced tax revenue, it has become necessary to increase the issuance of national treasury bonds to provide funding. As for issuing long-term bonds, it is particularly difficult at present, as French savers are willing to buy short-term bonds due to the unstable financial situation but demand high interest rates for long-term bonds, which would hinder economic recovery. Therefore, after careful consideration, the government decided to increase the issuance of short-term bonds. Not only that, short-term bondholders can easily discount and exchange them when they need cash, which is the same method used in the United Kingdom. This bill is valid until 1935, and the amount of issuance will be reduced by the end of this year. In short, the government maintains currency stability while allowing the national treasury to circulate cash in the market. This is the purpose of the financial bill. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>Wooden Ladder as Material Evidence</p>
<p>Flemington: Defense lawyers in the Lindbergh kidnapping case claimed that the wooden ladder was unrelated to the defendant and could not be considered evidence. However, the prosecutors refuted this. Today, the court ruled that the ladder could be used as material evidence. It is heard that the prosecutors will present an argument that the defendant carried Lindbergh Jr. away while he was asleep. When he was descending the ladder, the defendant lost his footing and fell, and little Lindbergh was crushed to death. The prosecutors will also prove that the ladder is the same object that a witness saw near the Lindbergh home before the kidnapping. The prosecutors are confident that a verdict can be reached within a few days. The evidence against Hauptmann in the Lindbergh kidnapping and murder is conclusive. The ransom notes were written by Hauptmann, and Hauptmann received the $50,000 ransom. These two points are undeniable. Public interest in this case remains undiminished. Many people attend the court hearings every day, and news reporters record all the details of the case in detail. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Representatives from the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Zhang Weiru and Wu Limen, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 23rd. Gu Xinyi and others are scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 24th to attend the Legislative Yuan's review meeting on the transaction tax. According to Wu Limen, the various stock exchanges will only be able to express their opinions on the request for exemption or reduction of the transaction tax after everyone has arrived in Nanjing to show consistency. Currently, from the perspective of the Securities Exchange, its market transactions are purely government bonds. If a tax is levied, those who trade can trade outside the exchange, which will not only affect market transactions but also affect the credibility of government bonds. Therefore, taxing securities is acceptable, but taxing government bond transactions seems to have too great an impact, and there is no country in Europe, America, or Japan that taxes government bonds. This is the opinion that the Securities Exchange intends to strongly advocate. (Special Telegram, 23rd)</p>

In other words, the material cost of the loan borrowed by the Huai River Conservancy Committee from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund was paid to the Huai River Conservancy Committee by Sassoon, and Sassoon purchased the goods from London. This is an exchange procedure that is convenient for both parties and is different from a pledge. As for the use of cash, it will be used to complete the three-gate project in Huaiyin Shaobo and other places, and the Sanhong Gate project fee will be started. It is near Hongze Lake. Therefore, the four gates are related to the storage and discharge of water from the Huai River, which is used to irrigate farmland, so that all of them will be completed within two years, and will not be used for other purposes.

<p>American Cotton: The weather in the cotton-growing areas is extremely cold, which can eliminate boll weevils and lay a good foundation for new cotton crops. However, cotton prices are lower. Liverpool sold, and the decline was even worse. However, as market prices fell, some assistance came from Europe.</p>

<p>London: The London rubber market was quiet this morning. The trading price for April-June futures at noon was 6.5 pence, the same as yesterday.</p>
<p>New York: The price of rubber for March fell six pounds, dropping below the price of 13 cents. There were few transactions and little interest. The decline at the opening this morning was mostly due to the lower prices in the London market.</p>

<p>New York: The securities market this morning remained sluggish and lacked excitement. It is expected that price fluctuations will be small and staggered. Market conditions seem lifeless, with no real upward or downward trend. Transactions are small and prices change very little. The news of increased work in steel mills was welcomed, and other business news, such as the increase in weekly electricity and oil output, also had a positive impact. However, market conditions are floating and have no direction, waiting to be pushed. The outlook is bearish at the moment.</p>
<p>There are currently various uncertain situations, so the market does not seem to be improving.</p>
<p>And Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. reports: Before the opening of the New York stock market, the factors favorable to the market situation are (1) there is still investment demand with selective qualities in the securities market, (2) the floor is gradually becoming stronger, (3) the average daily output of oil in the past week was 2,521,000 barrels, (4) the electricity output last week was 1,778,000,000 kilowatt-hours, an increase of 9.4% compared to last year, (5) The Iron Age newspaper estimates that steel bar production last week accounted for 51.1% of production capacity, and said that although steel scrap prices have fallen, making people cautious, steel bar production is expected to increase, as the demand from the automotive industry has not shown any signs of decreasing. The factors that are unfavorable to the market situation are that the outlook for business is now quite chaotic and uncertain. If there is no external assistance, the securities market may not see prices rise again. The various market prices of New York securities are listed on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Chahar Eastern Incident Has Eased <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Longliang Area is Still Defended by Local Militias</p>
<p>Yue Kaixian Talks with Zhang and Matsui</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states that the Japanese army's active deployment in Jehol Western has not been a matter of just one day. However, they have only been accumulating grass and storing food, and increasing troop deployment, which has been purely preparatory work, with no obvious signs of advancement. It was not until the middle of this month that they gradually became active, claiming that the Longliang, Wuni River, North and South Stone Pillars areas near Guyuan are under the jurisdiction of Fengning County, Jehol. The Chahar Provincial Government immediately negotiated with Matsui, the Japanese Liaison Officer stationed in Zhangjiakou. Ping Fang also filed a negotiation with the Japanese Embassy, and the military attache Takahashi telegraphed the Japanese army in Jehol and agreed to use diplomatic means to explain the misunderstanding, considering it a local incident to be resolved locally. Our side sent personnel from the Chahar Provincial Government to investigate, and Matsui from the Japanese side went to Chahar Eastern to investigate the truth. He returned to Zhangjiakou the day before yesterday. Yue Kaixian, the Diplomatic Commissioner of Chahar, returned to Zhangjiakou from Beiping yesterday, arriving at 6:00 PM in the evening, and started negotiations with the Japanese representative in conjunction with Qin Dechun. Yue Kaixian and Matsui are old classmates and have excellent relations, making negotiations easier. The Longliang, Wuni River, North and South Stone Pillars areas belong to Chahar territory, as evidenced by Chinese and foreign maps. The boundaries are clear. The area has always been defended by local militias, and there are no formally stationed Chinese troops, which is also a fact. It is difficult to fabricate something out of nothing and call a deer a horse. Since both parties filed negotiations, the situation in Chahar Eastern has slightly eased. The Longliang, Wuni River, and other places are still defended by local militias, and it has been peaceful in recent days. Zhangjiakou receives daily telegrams from Beiping, reporting on the situation at the front. The following is the gist of the telegrams from yesterday and today: (1) The Japanese puppet troops on the Jehol border are still stationed in the same place. The militias in Longliang, Wuni River, North and South Stone Pillars, etc., have not withdrawn, and order remains the same. The locality is peaceful. (2) Chahar Eastern has been peaceful in recent days. Our militias are still defending the Longliang, Wuni River, North and South Stone Pillars area. Although the Japanese attitude has eased after Matsui, the Japanese Liaison Officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, went to Chahar Eastern for inspection, the issue has not been completely resolved and negotiations with Matsui are continuing. It is said that the Japanese puppet troops discovered in Datang the day before yesterday have retreated. The situation in Chahar Eastern has indeed eased in recent days. Today, representatives from both sides began negotiations in Zhangjiakou. The person in charge on the Japanese side is Matsui, and the person in charge on our side is Qin Dechun and Yue Kaixian, etc. As the situation in Chahar Eastern has eased, Song Zheyuan, the Chairman of Chahar, will not return to Chahar during the Lunar New Year. Qin Dechun will come to Beiping once negotiations have made some headway. (January 22)</p>

<p>Installation of Long-Distance Repeater Machines</p>
<p>Establishment of Public Telephones for the Masses</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Since Director Zhao Zengjue took office at the Provincial Telephone Bureau in the summer of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], he has been determined to rectify various facilities. As a result of two years of diligent promotion, a provincial telecommunications network has been completed. Recently, to promote the enterprise, repeaters have been installed for long-distance telephones to increase transmission efficiency. For local telephones, public telephone agencies have been established to promote widespread use. In addition, measures for news communication via telephone have been established to facilitate news reporters' use of telephones to transmit news. Details are as follows: (1) Installation of Repeaters: In order to improve the effectiveness of long-distance telephones and clearly transmit sound waves, the Provincial Telephone Bureau specially ordered repeaters from abroad and completed their installation in Hangzhou. Trial use began a few days ago. From Ningbo to Shanghai Jiangwan and the new urban area, the sound waves were exceptionally clear and the results were excellent after testing using the repeaters. The bureau is also testing long-distance telephones in the remote counties of Wenzhou and Chuzhou in order to communicate directly with Shanghai, so that communication over hundreds of miles is no different from communication within the city. (2) Establishment of Public Telephones for the Masses: To facilitate the use of telephones by the people of Hangzhou, the Provincial Telephone Bureau is establishing public telephone agencies in Hangzhou. Reputable stores and alleys along the lines can apply to operate them. The payment methods are divided into two types: ordinary and special. Ordinary ones are exempt from installation fees, and each call is calculated at two cents and eight mills. Special ones are charged according to the city telephone regulations, and the monthly rent is charged according to Type C users, which will be implemented immediately. (3) Jiang-Zhejiang News Telephone Communication to be Implemented Next Month: In order to enable news reporters to transmit news via telephone, the Provincial Telephone Bureau has drafted preferential measures similar to the news telegraph regulations and sought the consent of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. With the agreement of both parties, the two provinces of Jiang-Zhejiang can communicate news by telephone, which is scheduled to be implemented on February 1. News reporters in Nanjing and Suzhou can make calls with news telephone certificates. The Zhejiang Telephone Bureau has already started issuing these certificates through the Business Section within days. (23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e127">Dredging of the South Salt Iron Ditch to Commence Soon <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The South Salt Iron Ditch in Punan, more than thirty li long, is the hub for reaching various towns in Punan. It has not been dredged for nearly forty years, resulting in siltation and impassable waterways. Yesterday, County Magistrate Jin led Section Chief Xu Mojia of the Technical Section to the Tingyu Huan'an Town to meet with local gentry Yang Chengfu to discuss dredging measures. A decision was made to proceed with the work, and the dredging personnel will commence work in mid-February. A special request for funding has been submitted to the Construction Department. In addition, the Changshan River dredging project has also been scheduled to commence simultaneously with the city river in mid-February to promote water conservancy.</p>

<p>The executive and supervisory committee members of the Jinshan County Party Headquarters, Lü Xiao, Xiao Yongjiang, Ye Jiarui, Wang Qiyuan, and the alternate executive and supervisory committee members, jointly submitted their resignation to the Provincial Party Headquarters, stating in brief that they were elected as executive and supervisory committee members by the Delegates' Congress in the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933] and approved by the committee for record. Since taking office, it has been more than a year. Reflecting on themselves, they feel inadequate in learning and lack experience. Moreover, the county party's funds are insufficient each month, and personnel and administration are handled in accordance with the regulations. There is no way to make up for the deficits. Furthermore, local politics are not well-managed, construction is not thriving, and corruption is rampant. Repeated reports have been made, but to no avail. They feel it is difficult to handle affairs in this environment, so they specifically submit their resignation, hoping for approval.</p>

<p>The water and land police teams of Wujiang and Wuxian counties, in order to maintain the security of the four rural areas during the winter defense period, plan to implement joint defense. They held a joint defense meeting of the two counties at the Wujiang County Public Security Bureau yesterday (23rd). The chairman, Nie Dezhao (attached to the Wuxian Security Brigade), decided on the spot that each of Wujiang and Wuxian counties should send a security team to be stationed in the Yinshan Jiapu Bridge area at the border of the two counties. In case of bandit alerts, they will be dispatched at any time to maintain land defense. As for water defense, it will be the responsibility of the various sub-teams of the Water Public Security Second District to patrol for a long period of time, and joint sentry duty will be implemented from today to facilitate communication.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Lawyer Arrested by Head of Criminal Prosecution Bureau <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Sun Wenying, a local resident, also known as lawyer Sun Zuhong, is the younger brother of former County Magistrate Sun Zuji. The other night, Sun and his friends Zhu Yunsheng and others were chatting in Room 59 of the New World Hotel and playing donkey cards. Inspector Feng of the Public Security Bureau discovered them and took them to the bureau. Section Chief Yi Weifan opened the court. Sun and others argued that donkey cards are popular in Europe and the West and are the same as chess in China, so they did not admit to gambling. However, Section Chief Yi still sentenced them to a fine of ten yuan for similar gambling. Sun and others immediately requested to read the statement and found that the statement recorded that Sun and others had admitted to gambling, so they requested a correction, but it was not allowed. Then they declared that they did not accept the punishment and requested that the fine be changed to a deposit, retaining the right to appeal, which was also not allowed. Afterwards, Sun and Zhu published advertisements in the local newspaper, declaring the illegal actions of the Public Security Bureau. On the one hand, they sued Chen Yuchu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Section Chief Yi Weifan in the local branch court for abusing their power and infringing on their freedom. On the other hand, Inspector Feng of the Public Security Bureau also sued Sun and others in court for defamation by publishing in the newspaper. At the same time, more than ten lawyers from this county, including Zhou Jiapu, Zhou Beiwu, and Li Yaochun, said that the people did not accept the Public Security Bureau's punishment for violating the law and could file an appeal according to the law. The Supreme Court had issued Interpretation No. 701 in the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932]. The bureau took advantage of its power to play with the law, depriving the people of their rights, and changing the statement. All the truth and falsehood should be thoroughly investigated. Yesterday, they specifically sent a joint telegram to County Magistrate Yan, requesting a fair and thorough investigation.</p>

<p>The county government of this county has been handling cases of drug use since June to September last year, totaling 49 cases. All the exhibits confiscated in each case, amounting to more than a thousand pieces, were burned in the open space of the county government yesterday morning at 10 o'clock. Bai Zhujun, a training officer from the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters, was dispatched to supervise nearby, and representatives from various agencies and groups also went to observe. County Magistrate Yan ordered the police to take the drugs out of the warehouse, place them on firewood, pour kerosene on them, and set them on fire. It took an hour to complete.</p>

<p>Mingyi, the abbot of the Shemiao Temple in Maosi Turen Lane, Cheng Yizhen, Wu County, is 60 years old. Because the temple has no property and there are no other monks or incense followers, only Mingyi lives in the temple, chanting scriptures and selling services for a living. He is diligent and thrifty, and has saved a little money in the past ten years. However, bandits learned of this and went to kill him on the night of the 20th of this month. All the money and miscellaneous items were robbed. After Mingyi was killed, no one outside knew about it. It was not until the evening of the 22nd, when a water chestnut seller went to ask for money, entered the temple and shouted for the old monk, but there was no sound. Then the corpse was found in the stove, which was very shocking. He ran to tell the neighbors, and they went to check together. They saw that the monk's head had multiple knife wounds, and there were blood stains everywhere in the temple. All the miscellaneous items were messed up. It was undoubtedly a murder for money. The Public Security First Branch dispatched police to the temple to investigate and reported to the County Court Prosecutor's Office to send personnel to inspect on the 23rd in order to arrest the murderer and investigate the case.</p>

<p>The land declaration in this county was originally scheduled to end on the 20th of this month. On the 19th, Section Chief Liu Zhipan of the Finance Department, representing the director, came to the county to inspect. Because the land declaration in the rural areas has been extended repeatedly and has not yet been completed, indicating poor performance, he sent a letter to County Magistrate Ma ordering that all declarations be completed before the 25th. If there is any delay, the district chiefs will be dismissed and investigated. If it can be completed early within the deadline, the department will give preferential awards. After County Magistrate Ma approved the letter, he immediately sent telegrams to the directors and instructors of each district, instructing them to comply with the instructions and urging all towns that have not yet completed the work to complete it before the 25th. If there is any further delay, they will definitely be dismissed and punished without leniency.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Italian Ambassador to China Went to Nanjing Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to First Call on Acting Foreign Minister Wang Today</p>
<p>To Present Credentials to the Chairman Tomorrow</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Italian Ambassador to China, Signor Vincenzo Lojacono (formerly translated as Wenshenzuo), is scheduled to meet with the Chairman of our National Government in Nanjing tomorrow (25th) to present his credentials. He took the train to Nanjing at 1:10 p.m. yesterday, attaching a special car. Those who went to the station to greet him included Yu Ming, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Section Chief Zhao Tiezhang, Zhang Menglin, Keng Jiaji, the secretary of the Municipal Government, Erlong, the Consul General of Italy, and many members of the Italian Embassy, Liang Fuchu, the director of the North Railway Station Public Security Bureau, who also sent police to protect and take care of everything. The Italian ambassador arrived at the station at 12:50 p.m., wearing a brown coat and looking radiant. He first shook hands with the Chinese greeters, entered the station, raised his right hand again, and gave the Fascist salute to the Italian consulate staff. After a brief exchange of greetings, he boarded the train and met with reporters from various newspapers. He gave a brief speech in English, saying that today was his first day in your country's capital and he was very happy. Sino-Italian relations have always been friendly. This time, the diplomatic upgrade between the two countries is something he will advance with the same spirit. Italy is a Fascist country, and China has repeatedly sent people to inspect it, which can also be a clear indication of the friendship between the two countries. The issue of moving the embassy to Nanjing is something the Italian government and he himself deeply desire, but due to economic reasons, it is not yet possible to discuss it. Finally, when asked by reporters when he would go to Beijing, Mr. Lojacono initially said it would be around March, then said it might be at the end of February. The staff accompanying the Italian ambassador to Nanjing included First Secretary Gabbaccio, Chinese Counselor Ross, Second Secretary Cecchi, Naval Attaché or Military Attaché Spacogni, and Air Attaché Dalango, a total of five people. After meeting with the Chairman of the National Government tomorrow, they will also visit the mausoleum on the 26th and meet with the ministers of various ministries.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union Recognizes the "Puppet State" as the Local Government of the Three Northeastern Provinces</p>
<p>That Local Authority Has Precedents for Negotiating with the Soviet Union on the East Road</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the China Eastern Railway Has Nothing to Do, So It Is Being Abolished</p>
<p>China United News Agency reports from Shanghai that, according to a Japanese telegram yesterday, a compromise has been reached in the illegal negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union, and a formal signing is scheduled for next month. A reporter from China United News Agency visited the Shanghai office of the Soviet Embassy at 11 a.m. yesterday. The acting ambassador, Mr. Spifanyarak, and Secretary Mirivaneski received them. According to them, the Shanghai office of the Soviet Embassy has not received a formal report from the Moscow government. Whether the news of the success of the East Road negotiations is true cannot be confirmed. Before receiving formal information, it is not convenient to express an opinion. When asked whether this would violate the Sino-Soviet Agreement of 1924 regarding the East Road, Mr. Mirivaneski replied that, in his personal opinion, the Chinese government cannot exercise management rights over the East Road. Although the Soviet Union does not recognize "Manchukuo," it recognizes the Manchurian authorities as the local government of the Three Northeastern Provinces as before. The local government of the Three Northeastern Provinces has precedents for conducting diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet Union to resolve the management of the East Road. When asked whether the abolition of the Shanghai office of the China Eastern Railway was related to the Soviet Union's abandonment of the East Road, he said that the office had nothing to do in Shanghai and was useless, so it was abolished.</p>

<p>Huang Himself Has Arrived in Calcutta Waiting for a Ship to Shanghai</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that Huang Musong, the special envoy sent by the National Government to Tibet to pay tribute to the Dalai Lama, has returned to Nanjing via India after completing his mission in Tibet. Except for Mr. Huang himself, who went to Nepal while passing through India, his staff has already taken the French ship Pajinlan from India to Shanghai. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the night before, but was slightly delayed due to fog. It arrived at the port at 8 a.m. yesterday and docked at the Gonghexang Wharf in Hongkou. After the staff disembarked, they returned to their residences to rest and are scheduled to report to Nanjing within days. As for Mr. Huang himself, it is reported that he has left Nepal and arrived in Calcutta, India, and will soon take a ship to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Regarding the Chahar Eastern Incident</p>
<p>Not as Bad as Rumored</p>
<p>Li Zeyi, a member of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Affairs Readjustment Committee and advisor to the Fujian Provincial Government, recently went from Beiping to Nanjing to visit the central authorities and report on the recent political situation in North China. He has now completed his mission and took the train from Nanjing to Shanghai on the 22nd. According to Mr. Li, when interviewed by reporters yesterday, although the Chahar Eastern Incident was tense for a while, it was not as bad as rumored. It is currently being negotiated by both parties and is expected to be resolved soon. The current situation in North China is quite peaceful. The work of clearing the war zone is being carried out step by step by the War Zone Clearance Committee according to the planned plan. There are still some scattered problems that have not been resolved. As for the rumors that the Beiping Political Affairs Readjustment Committee will be reorganized, it is absolutely untrue. When asked when Mr. Huang would take over the concurrent post of Minister of Interior, he replied that Chairman Huang has too many official duties in the Beiping Political Affairs Readjustment Committee and has not yet decided whether to take over the concurrent post of Minister of Interior. As for when he will come to Shanghai, he has not heard of it either. He will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then go to Nanjing again before returning to Shanghai. At that time, he plans to take a vacation to Fujian before going north again.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Second Strike at Twelve Forts Blocks Haizhou Salt Transport <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Huai salt is usually loaded onto ships at Jiangzikou, Haizhou, and other places to Twelve Forts, and then loaded onto steamships to be transported to various ports along the Yangtze River. Since the last strike occurred, the salt affairs authorities have complied with the requests of the salt transport workers and junk boatmen to allow half of the ships to remain in Twelve Forts for transshipment. Unexpectedly, after the strike was resolved, the salt workers in Twelve Forts claimed that they could not get half of the work, and a second strike broke out suddenly. Not only Twelve Forts, but even Pukou was affected.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Workers Detain Merchant Ships <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>When the strike occurred, the salt workers tried their best to sabotage the salt loading work in order to achieve their goal of stopping the strike. The various merchant ships in Shanghai that had already signed contracts to transport Huai salt to Chu initially did not know about this. Some of them sailed to Haizhou to load salt. For example, a certain merchant ship in Shanghai arrived in Haizhou the day before yesterday. Before it could be loaded, it was discovered by the strikers, who immediately detained the ship and sent people to guard it, not allowing it to be loaded. They even threatened that if any more merchant ships tried to load salt and disrupt their strike, they would dismantle the ships.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Salt Transport Completely Stalled <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>After the Yuanxing ship unloaded the timber at Dapu, it was originally scheduled to load salt to transport to Han. Unexpectedly, the strike broke out suddenly, and some salt transport ships had already been detained. The ship was deeply afraid of accidents, so it immediately stopped transporting salt and returned to Shanghai empty. The various ships in Shanghai that had already signed leases to transport salt to Han, after hearing this alarming news, were also afraid of unexpected damage and stopped loading one after another. Salt transport has been blocked.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Settlement of Cross-Border Road Construction and Electricity Rights <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Talk by Xu Peihuang of the Municipal Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>Shanghai Times News Agency reports that the electricity issue regarding cross-border road construction in this city has been formally signed this month, after the long term negotiation between both sides. The Shanghai West Electricity Co., Ltd. has been announced to be established in name. Yesterday, Xu Peihuang, director of the Public Works Bureau, issued a statement regarding the progress of the situation. According to Xu, due to various circumstances, the time taken in the middle was quite long for the electricity issue regarding the cross border roads. However, as of recently, all settlements have been reached and the agreement has been formally signed on the fourth of this month. The agreement was jointly signed by the mayor and the general manager of the electricity company. The contents of the agreement consist of the electricity company paying a one-time franchise fee of 1.5 million yuan. The operating period is set at 30 years. Upon the expiry of the period, the municipal government has the priority right to receive an appraisal. In addition, during the monopoly period, the company will pay 5% of its operating income to the municipal government annually as remuneration. According to the above agreement, in order to handle the power supply matters in the western district of Shanghai, the Shanghai West Electricity Co., Ltd. will be established. The company is required to have a capital of 6 million yuan, of which the electricity company accounts for 51% and Chinese business accounts for 49%. The business scope mainly includes electric lights, electric power, and electricity industry. Currently, the franchise fee of 1.5 million yuan has been paid to the municipal government by the electricity company in one lump sum. As for the Shanghai West Electricity Co., Ltd., it has been announced in name since the establishment of the agreement. However, in fact, various registration procedures are currently being submitted to the municipal government and the Public Works Bureau for processing. It is also heard that all 6 million yuan of stock have been raised and can be formally established within the next one or two months. As for the recent dissenting remarks from the side of the board of works, this is the electric power supply right of the public concession of the Shanghai Electricity Co., Ltd., which was paid by the board of works, or there may be some points of discussion in their mutual agreement, but generally speaking, there should be no problem for the Shanghai West Electricity Co., Ltd.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Banking Sector Low-Interest Loans to Support Industry <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Cannot Be Achieved Without Government Subsidies</p>
<p>And Interest Rates on Depositors Must Be Reduced</p>
<p>丨A Conversation with a Certain Banker丨</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the cotton industry in our country has recently suffered from the impact of expensive cotton and cheap yarn, as well as the dumping of inferior goods, which has resulted in the closure of many spinning mills. It was reported a few days ago that Nie Lusheng, a leader in the cotton industry, said that the reason for the failure of the cotton industry was due to high interest rates, and suggested that various banks organize a cotton industry banking group, and the interest on loans to cotton mills should not exceed 4%. The loss beyond that should be compensated by government allocations. According to a certain banker interviewed by reporters yesterday, the rescue of Chinese factories by the banking sector is an obligation that should be fulfilled. The plan to reduce loan interest rates was proposed several years ago, but it ultimately failed because the national treasury was in deficit and could no longer allocate funds to compensate for this loss, so it was disbanded. Now that someone has raised this issue again, if the government can deposit funds with an interest rate of 70 to 80 mills, or even 1%, the loans that are released will inevitably be above 70 to 80 mills. Therefore, the banking sector alone cannot think of a way. If foreign banks are used as a comparison, the interest rate on deposits in foreign banks is only 1% to 2%, so the interest rate on loans only needs to be 3%.</p>

<p>After the loan amount was agreed upon, Director Xu Qingfu of the Zhejiang Finance Department and the Shanghai banking sector jointly drafted a contract, stipulating the repayment method, which is scheduled to repay 200,000 yuan in the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936], 400,000 yuan in the 26th year, 600,000 yuan in the 27th year, and 800,000 yuan in the 28th year. All principal and interest will be repaid by then. After the draft contract was drafted, it was taken back by Director Xu Qingfu of the Zhejiang Finance Department and submitted to the provincial government meeting for approval. According to a certain bank that is borrowing this loan, the Zhejiang Finance Department has already signed the contract the day before yesterday and handed it over to the Hangzhou Bank of China for transfer to the various banks in Shanghai for signing.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Postal Savings and Remittances General Bureau to Move to Nanjing in Mid-Next Month <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Northeast Remittances to Be Realized One Day</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the Ministry of Communications decided to move the General Bureau of Posts and the General Bureau of Savings and Remittances to Nanjing, the General Bureau of Posts has been completely moved to Nanjing before the 20th of this month. The General Bureau of Savings and Remittances originally planned to move to Nanjing in early next month. One reason is that early next month is the time for a major conclusion, and the other is that remittances with the Northeast will begin on the first day of next month, so the move must be started in mid-next month. It is expected that the move can be completed by the end of next month. The information gathered is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Northeast Remittances　In order to facilitate the people of the Northeast, the authorities have decided to communicate mail and remittances with the Northeast. Postal communication began on the 10th of this month, and remittances will be realized on the first day of next month. According to the person in charge of the General Bureau of Savings and Remittances, the bureau has informed all its subordinates that the date of remittance is imminent, and has detailed the procedures to be followed so that the subordinate savings and remittance agencies can comply. The procedures are roughly the same as in the past, but because the currency system in the Northeast is now different, the remittance is more troublesome. In the future, the bureau will notify the remittance bureaus according to the market price so that they can be collected and exchanged.</p>
<p>Bureau Address Relocation　The bureau's relocation issue has already been organized by the Relocation Committee, which is planning all the relocation procedures. The Nanjing bureau address has now been selected as the newly built building of the Ministry of Communications. The committee is now actively preparing all the relocation procedures. The relocation was originally scheduled to begin in early next month, but because it is close to the end of the lunar year, the bureau is also a financial institution, so it is actually busier at this time, so it may not be possible to relocate as scheduled. The relocation is expected to begin in mid-next month, and it is expected that all the relocation can be completed in Nanjing by the end of next month. As for the restoration of the Shanghai bureau to its original state after the bureau moves, this matter is also being planned.</p>

<p>Due to the Failure of Some Funds to Be Paid on Schedule</p>
<p>Payments Will Resume After the Collection Is Supplemented</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Wing On Silver Company has resumed business on the 21st of this month, and it has been three days so far. A total of more than 100,000 yuan has been withdrawn in these days. Because a portion of the funds, the subscribers failed to fulfill their previous promises and pay on schedule, resulting in the inability to meet the withdrawals of depositors, the company closed its doors again yesterday afternoon and temporarily suspended receipts and payments. A notice was posted on the door, which reads: To the public of all depositors, at this time of special financial decline, our company has tried its best to resume business. The sincere preparation and payment situation in these days can be witnessed by all sectors. Unexpectedly, on the day of resumption, the financial field of this city experienced another drastic shock, resulting in some of the funds prepared by our company from various parties temporarily unable to fulfill. Currently, after discussion by the subscribers, it is believed that unless the non-performing portion is collected and supplemented, it may affect the overall business in the future. It is therefore necessary to temporarily delay the payment. Our company has had both the fact of closing down and the fact of opening the door to make payments for two days, and we are unwilling to lose all our efforts. We must strive to remedy the complete integrity in the shortest possible time and continue to make payments. We hope that all depositors will appreciate our sincerity and give us a chance to help, so that we will not be trapped in a hopeless situation and cause our depositors in Shanghai to suffer losses together. Wing On Silver Company, January 23.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Reduction of Foreign Troops Stationed in Shanghai <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>But the Total Number of Japanese Troops Remains the Same</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the number of foreign troops stationed in Shanghai has decreased significantly in the past two months. According to information obtained yesterday, it does not appear likely that the number will increase again in the near future. After two battalions of French troops left Shanghai on January 1st, the number of troops stationed in Shanghai decreased by nearly half. There were rumors that a large battalion of Russians would be recruited to supplement them, but French authorities have denied this. The authorities have not explained the reason for the reduction of troops stationed in Shanghai, only stating that it may be due to government budget cuts in their home country. The troops that left Shanghai at the beginning of this month included one battalion each of Vietnamese and French troops. The Vietnamese troops returned to Vietnam, and the French troops returned to France. The number of American troops stationed in Shanghai has also recently decreased, with seven hundred men having already left Shanghai on the transport ship Chaumont, thus reducing the total number by nearly half. There are rumors that the American government is planning to further reduce the number of troops stationed in Shanghai. When this was asked of Colonel Bowman yesterday, he replied that there would be no increase in the near future, but it was also unlikely that there would be further reductions. As for the total number of British troops stationed in Shanghai, it has not decreased compared to two months ago, but at the beginning of last year there were two battalions, and now there is only one battalion left. Only the Japanese troops have not decreased. Although the troops stationed in Shanghai have changed several times, the total number remains the same as before.</p>

<p>Each Carrying a Letter of Opinion to Vigorously Argue before the Assembly</p>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Brokers Association Submits a Request for Delay</p>
<p>The Shiye News Agency reports that since the Ministry of Finance announced the scheduled imposition of a transaction tax, the five exchanges in this city immediately held joint meetings to appeal to the Central Political Council, the National Government, Chairman Chiang, and various ministries and departments, requesting exemption. The Ministry of Finance submitted the matter to the Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan, which will review it again today. Because the exchanges received a notice from the Legislative Yuan, they specially dispatched eighteen representatives last night at eleven o'clock, carrying letters of opinion from each exchange, to rush to Beijing on the Beijing-Shanghai express train to participate in the meeting, consult on everything, and pre-determined three measures in a joint meeting to submit to the assembly for discussion. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e153">Joint Meeting Proposes Three Measures <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the five exchanges of this city—cotton cloth, gold, securities, flour, and miscellaneous grains—in addition to having the chairmen of each exchange prepare a reply to the notice from the Legislative Yuan and a petition, convened a joint meeting to discuss three measures to request from the Legislative Yuan: (1) request the withdrawal of the proposal to levy taxes; (2) temporarily postpone the levy (if the above two items cannot be done, then the following third measure will be used to request a reduction in the tax rate, and it must be achieved); (3) reduce the percentage, predetermining 0.0025% for marketable securities, that is, a tax of 2.5 cents for every 10,000 yuan of transaction (the Ministry of Finance has revised this to 0.0125%); cotton, cotton yarn, flour, and miscellaneous grains are all reduced to 0.0005%, that is, a transaction tax of 5 cents is levied for every 10,000 yuan (the Ministry of Finance has set the tax at 72.5 cents per 100 piculs of cotton, 3.075 yuan per 100 bales of cotton yarn, 57.5 cents per 1,000 bags of flour, and 1.275 yuan per 1,000 catties of miscellaneous grains). The brokers associations of the other exchanges also held meetings yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to vigorously argue for their case, prepare letters of opinion outlining the difficult circumstances of each exchange, and at eleven o'clock yesterday afternoon, they accompanied the chairmen of each exchange, carrying important documents, to Beijing. The list of representatives includes Cotton Cloth Chairman Mu Ouchu, Brokers Association Bian Futang, Wu Xunqing, Shao Wenmei; Miscellaneous Grains Chairman Gu Xinyi, Brokers Association Xue Chengzhang, Xu Jianqi; Securities Chairman Zhang Weiru, Brokers Association Wang Zhengru, Wu Limen, He Peiyuan; Flour Chairman Wang Yiting (due to illness, entrusted to Gu Xinyi to represent); Brokers Association Zhang Weiyun, Wang Zhongliang, Yang Jingcheng; Gold Chairman Xu Busun, Brokers Association Zhan Liansheng, Ren Jiafu, and seventeen others.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Cotton Cloth Brokers Association Petition <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange Brokers Association submitted a document to the Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan, stating: "In order to deliberate on the transaction tax and explain the difficulties of business, this association previously submitted details of the commercial difficulties and inability to bear the burden to the Ministry of Finance on several occasions. Now we have received a notice from your committee stating that the case is about to be reviewed and requesting us to send representatives to state our opinions, showing the utmost intention of your committee to consult widely and be open-minded. Now, this association dares to present the true difficulties of business, which were not covered in the previous submission, and humbly ask for your consideration. Recently, due to the bankruptcy of rural villages in the interior, the purchase of cotton has decreased, resulting in various groups stationed in Shanghai and yarn merchants closing down due to the lack of business. Yarn factories and cotton merchants in various places are also reducing their activities on the exchange due to financial constraints and lack of turnover. On the other hand, foreign firms, due to the recession in their own countries in recent years, have also broken various precedents (such as waiving margin money and reducing commissions), giving preferential treatment to customers and competing for Chinese business, resulting in the increasingly depressed state of the business of this association's merchants and their gradual decline. (Omission) Based on the above-mentioned reasons, the difficulties of this association's merchants are becoming increasingly apparent and need not be concealed. If a transaction tax is added, this burden will be difficult to pass on in today's extremely depressed industrial and commercial environment. The result will not only be the further decline of this association's merchants' business and its virtual stagnation, but also the further decline of the depressed commercial situation and the transformation of the stagnant economy into panic, which is contrary to the government's original intention of opening up financial resources and promoting industry and commerce. Therefore, we dare to make another appeal when your committee deliberates, humbly requesting your committee to understand the people's hardships, consider the overall situation, and approve the postponement of the case. We are eagerly awaiting your order. Respectfully submitted to the Finance and Economics Committee of the Legislative Yuan, representative of the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange Brokers Association, Bian Futang."</p>

<h3 id="e157">Cotton Cloth Exchange Submits Document to the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Responding to the Hua Shang Yarn Factory's Request to Stop Auctioning Cotton</p>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Exchange submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry, responding to the Hua Shang Yarn Factory's claim to ban speculation, restrict trading, and stop auctioning cotton, stating: "We submit this petition. Recently, we saw in the newspaper that Wuxi Shenxin and other yarn factories, and Shanghai Wing On and other yarn factories, submitted documents to various ministries and departments of the central government, requesting the banning of speculation, restricting trading, and stopping the auctioning of cotton in order to maintain the textile industry. They made many accusations against our exchange, but completely ignored commercial facts and the law, even claiming that this association is like the East India Company, and only by destroying and eliminating it can the crisis of the yarn industry be saved and the decline of the country be rescued. The strangeness of this argument is truly shocking. Without clarification, the truth will be obscured, making it difficult for the factories to be convinced and confusing the public. Therefore, before responding to each item, we will first briefly summarize the system and functions of the exchange as an outline. The exchange is a product of modern economic organization. European and American countries initiated it first, Japan followed, and China followed Japan. The reason for needing this organization is that modern market trade is becoming increasingly complex and competition is fierce. Without the formation of a publicly determined market price, it is not enough to reflect the actual situation of supply and demand in the market. Without the opportunity for hedging, it is not enough to allow the business community to operate freely. Without a centralized location for large-scale buying and selling, it is not enough to allow both supply and demand to be coordinated. The exchange was created to meet this need and is a necessary stage in the process of modern economic organization. Only because of this, if there is no exchange, then so be it. If there is an exchange, it cannot allow its buying and selling to be limited to the same industry. The exchange is originally a mechanism for buying and selling between supply and demand. Since supply and demand are not exclusively for the same industry, the exchange's buying and selling cannot be limited to the same industry. If it is limited to the same industry, it is to control and monopolize the market price of the nation's supply and demand with a small number of businesses in the same industry, leading to many malpractices. China's Exchange Law and the exchange laws of other countries have not set this restriction, probably because they know that setting this restriction is absolutely impossible in reality and would completely eliminate its ability to stabilize prices and regulate supply and demand. Furthermore, the buying and selling of the exchange cannot be called empty selling. Empty selling refers to not providing goods for delivery or not providing funds for delivery at the time of delivery. If the buying and selling of the exchange is based on providing goods or funds for delivery as a principle, before the delivery date, both the buyer and seller may resell and buy back to settle, but once the delivery period arrives, the buyer must prepare sufficient funds to receive the goods from the seller, and the seller must prepare sufficient goods to demand payment from the buyer. If one party cannot fulfill its obligations, it should be subject to penalties for breach of contract. This is the general rule of any exchange transaction. Therefore, when buying and selling in the market, no matter how large the amount bought or sold is, since it cannot be predicted that there will be no goods to provide for delivery at the time of delivery, it cannot be called empty selling. If it is said that empty selling refers to having no actual goods in hand when buying and selling, then when manufacturers sell forward yarn on the exchange, the yarn has not yet been spun, so how can there be so-called actual goods? It is only that the manufacturer sells forward yarn to the customer, giving only a piece of order. The customer can then sell it on the exchange. When the order expires, the manufacturer often only delivers a few percent due to insufficient allocation of goods and cannot deliver the full amount. The customer has no choice but to buy back the missing amount on the exchange to avoid being penalized for breach of contract. This often happens. In this situation, not only does the customer have no actual goods in hand when selling in the market, but the manufacturer also has no so-called actual goods when selling to the customer. Therefore, empty selling refers to buying and selling where the obligation to deliver cannot be fulfilled at the time of delivery and can never be said to be empty selling simply because there are no actual goods in hand when buying and selling on the exchange. Once this meaning is clear, the factories' request to ban empty selling on the association is aimless and not worth refuting. However, for the sake of clarity, we must explain each of the items listed in the original petition. According to the original petition, "The purpose of the exchange is to regulate supply and demand and stabilize prices. However, the brokers do not limit themselves to acting as agents for buying and selling for businesses in the same industry. Anyone only needs to pay a small amount of margin money to speculate, or even rely entirely on credit, and the margin money is also waived. Therefore, tens of thousands of bales of cotton yarn and hundreds of thousands of piculs of cotton are traded every day, but the number of deliveries at the end of the month is always less than one percent, which is pure speculation." The mission of the exchange is to regulate supply and demand and stabilize prices, but everyone must have the opportunity to entrust brokers to buy and sell in order to regulate, and both supply and demand must adopt a competitive buying and selling method to exchange what is available for what is not, and to help each other in order to stabilize. If it is said that only those in the same industry can buy and sell on the exchange, then all suppliers and demanders must be in the same industry. If not, how can the exchange complete its mission of regulating and averaging? Furthermore, China's Exchange Law only has the name of the client and does not stipulate that the client's qualifications are limited to businesses in the same industry, which clearly shows that the so-called client refers to the general public. However, the original petition actually used the fact that the brokers' buying and selling on behalf of customers is not limited to businesses in the same industry as a reason, and we truly do not know what it is based on. Furthermore, regardless of the amount of the brokers' buying and selling, they must pay margin money to the exchange in accordance with regulations. If the exchange believes that there is a large amount of buying and selling or that the market price is at risk of sharp increases or decreases, it can collect special margin money from them at any time to show restriction. It can be said that the exchange's supervision of brokers is extremely strict and its prevention is extremely close. As for brokers' collection of margin money from customers, they usually also collect margin money in accordance with regulations. Although there are occasional cases where a portion is collected or the entire amount is waived based on credit, it is purely a relationship of trust between the broker and the client. The exchange recognizes the broker as the main body of the transaction and should not interfere too much in this kind of behavior. How can this be blamed on the exchange? As for the amount of actual deliveries at the end of each month being less than one percent, this is an inevitable phenomenon of the exchange. Since the exchange has the fact of hedging and the method of reselling and buying back, buying and selling every day is extremely free. There is no need to wait for delivery day to deliver, and it can be settled at any time. Furthermore, in terms of delivery, there are two types: self-delivery and actual delivery. Actual delivery refers to the exchange executing the delivery on the delivery date. If the brokers contact each other properly before each delivery, deliver themselves, one party delivers the goods, and the other party receives the money to save procedures, it is called self-delivery. Therefore, it is not surprising that the amount of actual deliveries each month is less than one percent of the amount of buying and selling each month. Looking at the securities exchange, the amount of buying and selling each month reaches tens of millions, but how much is actually delivered? The amount of buying and selling on the gold exchange is also not less than thousands or tens of thousands each month, but the amount actually delivered is not only less than one percent, but even less than one-tenth of one percent. Furthermore, this is not only the case with exchanges in our country, but also with exchanges in other countries. However, the original petition actually pointed to this as evidence of pure speculation, not knowing what the word speculation means. If it is said that having no actual goods in hand when buying and selling in the market is speculation, then as we said before, there may not be actual goods in hand when buying and selling in the market, and manufacturers' hedging of futures cannot be uniquely different. Furthermore, Article 40 of the Exchange Law stipulates that "no one may establish a market similar to an exchange for the purpose of difference money trading outside the exchange for buying and selling," which clearly shows that difference money trading within the exchange is not prohibited by law. How can it be regarded as speculation and deeply hated? This is the first point. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e158">Yarn Industry Association Submits Document to the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Maintenance of the Yarn and Cotton Trading Market</p>
<p>The Yarn Industry Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry on January 22, stating: "We submit this petition, requesting the maintenance of the yarn and cotton trading market in order to facilitate sales and alleviate commercial difficulties. Recently, we saw in the newspaper that Chinese yarn factories are losing more than 20 yuan per bale of cotton yarn. Therefore, they jointly petitioned the government to send officials to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation of the actual situation and to order the Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange to find ways to maintain a balance between the prices of yarn and cotton. If the manufacturing costs of 20s standard yarn (excluding unified taxes) converted from the standard cotton market scale of 430 catties are less than 45 yuan, the auction should be stopped. We are not in a position to comment on whether the manufacturing cost of 20s yarn per bale must be so high. However, in the past year, non-Chinese yarn factories have made substantial profits. The same industry, the same period, and the same location have such different profits and losses, which cannot be created by merchants manipulating and scheming for profit. At a time when rural villages are bankrupt and finances are exhausted, they actually want to indulge their own selfish desires, deceive the government, and ban the exchange in order to manipulate the market and achieve their goal of enjoying profits, so that we have no opportunity to hedge, which is truly shocking. There are many yarn factories in the country, in addition to Chinese factories, there are also many Japanese and British factories. We will not discuss how much their various expenses should be. However, we have been operating in cotton yarn with the responsibility of promoting domestic yarn. Since the September 18th Incident, no matter how much profit Japanese yarn has, we have ignored it. This spirit of sacrifice cannot be said to be weak. Furthermore, due to frequent banditry and repeated disasters in the country, the rural villages have been bankrupted, and purchasing power has been decreasing daily, causing our business to decline. Each month, various groups purchase cotton yarn, but before the goods are shipped, the domestic market price has already weakened, or they sell cotton yarn in the interior, but before they can make up for it, the market price has gradually increased. This is a commercial risk that cannot be avoided. Fortunately, there is the market of the Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange, which allows them to hedge their sales or purchases, so that they can protect their losses in case of an emergency. Otherwise, our industry would have been wiped out long ago. Recently, we saw in a document from the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan that merchants manipulate and scheme for profit, and that supply and demand rely heavily on the organization of the exchange as a medium. These are reasonable and famous words and should not be criticized. Furthermore, each factory is aiming for a cost of 45 yuan and is petitioning the government to order the exchange to comply. In addition to the exchange market price, each factory will also use this as the basis for its transactions with us. Otherwise, they will eat their own words and will not know how to face the government or the exchange. It is a strategy of driving fish into the abyss, which we do not approve of for yarn factories. Furthermore, since our industry is closely related to yarn factories, we sincerely hope that each factory can obtain a substantial profit of more than 20 yuan per bale in the natural trend. We dare to ask each yarn factory to work hard on mechanical improvement, production increase, cost reduction, and reasonable management to seek progress and not to hinder the business of others with strategies that abandon the fundamentals and pursue the superficial. Because the stakes are high, we earnestly request your ministry to uphold justice in order to prevent the abuse of monopoly. We are eagerly awaiting your order. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Industry, presenter, Shanghai Yarn Industry Association."</p>

<p>Shu Chushi Returned to Shanghai Only Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Cultural Relics to be Transported to England Will Be Selected Soon</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that since the cultural relics stored in Shanghai from the Former Palace Museum were inspected by the cultural relic inspection specialist Shu Chushi, who was appointed by the Ministry of Education under the order of the Executive Yuan, and his assistant Xue Tiechen, who came to Shanghai last December, the cultural relics of the Ancient Artifacts Hall have been inspected successively for two months, totaling more than 400 boxes. Shu had to return to Beijing every Sunday of every one or two weeks to report to the Central Cultural Relic Preservation Committee. He still went to Beijing last Saturday (the 19th) as usual, because he attended the regular meeting of the Ancient Relic Management Committee and stayed in Beijing for several days. He returned to Shanghai only yesterday morning. The inspection of cultural relics continued yesterday morning. Shu Chushi, Ouyang Banghua, Xue Tiechen, and others went to the first warehouse on Tianzhutang Street before eight o'clock to work as usual. As for the cultural relics to be transported to England for the Ancient Relic Exhibition, it is heard that the Executive Yuan will send personnel to Shanghai to check the cultural relics in the current Qing Dynasty of the Ancient Relic Hall and the cultural relics of the Chenlie Institute that were selected. Last autumn, Lu Xirong, Fu Yiwen, and others were sent by the internal department to Shanghai to check the registration and sun-dry them. All were well preserved. It is said that Lu and Fu will still come to Shanghai to handle the selection matters.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Petition to the Seamen's Party Headquarters by the Bereaved Families of the Tongfu Steamer Incident <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Solving the Compensation Problem</p>
<p>The Tongfu Steamer encountered a reef and completely sank in Korean waters. All fifty-six crew members perished. After the news was confirmed, various seamen's organizations in this port immediately petitioned the Special Seamen's Party Headquarters of the Republic of China and the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau to form the Tongfu Steamer Seamen's Bereaved Family Relief Committee to handle compensation negotiations. The Special Seamen's Party Headquarters dispatched Mei Kaiyi and Wang Zhonggang to negotiate several times. Zhuo Huimin initially acted as the representative of Bao Anfu, the manager of the steamer company (Tong'an Company), to handle the case. Later, Bao also requested Shen Baolian and others to mediate. While the mediation was still in progress, Bao again entrusted lawyer Zhang Henghai to publish a notice in the newspaper, setting the amount of compensation and inviting the families to claim it. The families felt that the unilaterally determined amount was unfair and did not conform to Article 67 of the Maritime Law. Moreover, it was vastly different from the methods used for the China Merchants Bureau's Tunan Steamer and the Sanbei Company's Taishan Steamer. They again petitioned the Special Seamen's Party Headquarters, which dispatched Wang Zhonggang to negotiate directly with Zhang Henghai. Zhang indicated that he would consider it further. However, two days later, Bao Anfu again published an announcement in the newspaper (see the front page of the Shen Xin News on the 21st), distorting the Maritime Law and attempting to force the families to accept his unilaterally determined compensation. The families believed that the seamen were performing their duties while working and navigating on the ship. The ship's inadequate equipment and repeated accidents were sufficient proof of negligence. Recently, in Korean waters, the ship sank entirely, partly due to overloading with timber and partly due to hitting a reef. This was purely due to human error and should not be considered a natural disaster. The ship was insured in Japan, and Bao had already received the insurance money. Due to debt relations, he designated 40,000 yuan of the insurance money as compensation. Economically, Bao suffered no loss because of the insurance. However, the deaths of fifty-six people on board were a truly tragic and terrible disaster. Bao disregarded human feelings and national laws, and all the families resented and hated him. Bao himself returned to Shanghai from Japan and went into hiding, undoubtedly with others taking advantage of his absence to manipulate and monopolize everything, causing widespread anxiety. Yesterday, more than seventy family members gathered at the Chinese Jun'an Sailors' Public Association to discuss the final solution and petitioned the Special Seamen's Party Headquarters, requesting three points. Secretary Chen Songping of the Party Headquarters received them. The family representatives, including Chen Shenshi, recounted the case's progress: (1) They demanded that Bao Anfu be warned to appear and handle the matter within a time limit. (2) They insisted on receiving compensation according to the same methods as the Sanbei Company's Taishan Steamer. (3) If Bao Anfu continued to evade and not appear, they requested the Party Headquarters to petition the central government for a strict public wanted notice. After hearing the families' requests, Secretary Chen agreed to accept them and report them to Committee Member Yang for review.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Red Swastika Society's Relief Goods Exempt from Taxes and Fees for Transportation <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Red Swastika Society previously sent a team to the disaster areas in Jiangxi for relief efforts and specially petitioned Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to issue a general order for military police assistance and to inform the Ministries of Transportation and Finance to provide free transportation and tax exemption for relief goods. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued Order No. 305 of the Land Force, approving the record filing and ordering the Ministry of Military Affairs to issue a general order to the military police for unified protection and assistance. The Ministries of Transportation and Finance were also informed to investigate and handle the free transportation and tax exemption of relief goods. In addition to informing the Nanchang Headquarters, it is hereby notified for your information. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed all customs offices to exempt taxes and fees for the Red Swastika Society's purchase of 10,000 shi of foreign rice, 30,000 sets of cotton clothes, and 600 bolts of coarse cloth for relief efforts in Jiangxi. The Ministry of Transportation also instructed the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to allow the Red Swastika Society's relief goods to be transported at half price according to the military transportation regulations. The 200 tons of foreign rice that the society has already transported to Jiangxi Province have been discussed with Jiangxi Provincial Government Chairman Xiong and transported by allocated vehicles. The automobile transportation fees are borne by the Jiangxi Provincial Government. This batch of relief rice, along with 10,000 sets of relief clothing, has been distributed to various disaster areas for relief. It is reported that the society has continued to purchase 600 tons of foreign rice, totaling 6,650 shi, which was handed over to the Sanbei Company yesterday for transportation to Jiangxi via Qingpu. Another 10,000 sets of cotton clothing were purchased and delivered in batches to the China Merchants Bureau for transportation. Chairman Li Cikai was also elected to go to Jiangxi on the Jiangjing Steamer from Yangri with more than ten relief workers to investigate and release relief supplies. It is also reported that Chairman Li Cikai of the society was entrusted by the drought relief associations of various provinces to investigate and release relief supplies in the drought-stricken areas of Jiangxi. He also purchased a large quantity of foreign rice, which will be transported to Jiangxi in the coming days, and negotiated with the Jiangxi authorities to start the investigation and release relief supplies in the disaster areas along the Nanxun Road. Because the disaster area is vast, the first and second teams are insufficient, so the society has added a third relief team of more than ten people, who will be led by Tao Daokai and Huang Nanrun, two chairmen, to Jiujiang in the coming days to investigate and release relief supplies separately.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the establishment of the Emergency Relief Universal Donation Association, it has received enthusiastic support from all sectors, expressing sympathy and donating economic and material resources to save the people in disaster areas. It is reported that yesterday, Songyang Wenzhi Jun, sympathizing with the severe drought in Zhejiang Province last year, donated 500 yuan and sent someone to the association for collection, specifying that it be allocated to Zhejiang Province for relief. It is also selected to record a donation of 200 yuan, and the Shipbuilding Industry Association of the Fourth District donated 48 yuan and 4 jiao.</p>
<p>Various trade associations are working very hard to handle the universal donation. The donations they have made to the Emergency Relief Universal Donation Association have been recorded in various newspapers. Yesterday, the Soybean and Rice Industry Association donated 500 yuan, the Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Industry Association donated 250 yuan, the Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association donated 410 yuan, and the Color Printing Industry Association donated 150 yuan, all of which were sent to the association.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Lawyers Association Was Ordered to Comply</p>
<p>Lawyer Liu Bin was previously prosecuted by the French Concession police for fraud. After the Second Special Court concluded the trial, he was sentenced to imprisonment. The court notified the Lawyers Association to suspend Liu Bin from his duties. Subsequently, Liu appealed against the verdict, and after retrial, he was sentenced to a fine of 800 yuan. After the verdict, Liu believed that according to the Judicial Yuan's interpretation, he could still serve as a lawyer after being fined, so he sent a letter to the Lawyers Association requesting to restore his membership. After the executive and supervisory meeting of the Lawyers Association passed the resolution, he was allowed to restore his membership. Now it is learned that the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court believes that although Liu Bin was spared criminal punishment, his actions violated the Lawyers' Regulations and was referred for disciplinary action. During the disciplinary period, he should still be suspended from his duties. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the Lawyers Association to investigate, and the original text is as follows: For the matter of issuing an order, it is approved that the Lawyers' Disciplinary Committee of this court sent a letter stating that the committee accepted the case of lawyer Liu Bin being referred for disciplinary action. During the investigation, it was determined that it was necessary to suspend the lawyer's duties first. In accordance with the provisions of Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Lawyers' Disciplinary Committee Rules, a deliberation committee was convened at 1:30 PM on the 17th of this month to vote. The lawyer being referred for disciplinary action, Liu Bin, should be suspended from his duties first. The record is on file. In addition to sending the resolution to the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Second Special District Court for investigation and handling, a corresponding letter is sent to your president for investigation. With this approval, in addition to distribution, the association is hereby ordered to be informed. It is reported that after receiving the order, the Lawyers Association has already complied.</p>

<p>Dividing into Four Areas, Phased Exploration, and Borrowing Warships to Assist the Work</p>
<p>The Institute of Zoology and Botany of Academia Sinica recently organized a marine product survey team to study China's marine products and assist in the development of fisheries production. It is stipulated that it will take four years to complete all the work. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e170">Regional Measurement <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>In order to study the depth and salinity of seawater in the coastal provinces of China, as well as the growth conditions of animals and plants such as fish, shellfish, seaweed, and algae, Academia Sinica has specially organized a survey team to conduct on-site research, record it faithfully, and contribute to the domestic academic community and fishery-related organizations to increase marine product harvests. Regarding the scope of the survey, it has now been stipulated that the coastal areas of China will be divided into four regions: the first region is the Bohai Sea, from Weihaiwei to Qinhuangdao; the second region is the Yellow Sea, from Zhejiang to Jiangsu; the third region is the East China Sea, from Zhejiang to Fujian; and the fourth region is the South China Sea, from Fujian to Guangdong. In addition to accurate measurement and chemical testing, biological surveys will be conducted at any time. It is planned to survey the first region in the first year, the second region in the second year, the third region in the third year, and the fourth region in the fourth year.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Borrowing Warships <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The institute is conducting the above work with the survey team.</p>
<p>The above work will take a long time, and it will be difficult to achieve results without larger ships and comprehensive equipment. Last year, staff were sent to Weihaiwei to inspect and to Qingdao to meet with Xie Gangzhe, commander of the Fourth Fleet, to discuss the matter of borrowing warships. Xie agreed to provide full assistance. At the beginning of this month, Cai Yuanpei, president of Academia Sinica, sent a letter to Xie requesting permission to borrow warships. Recently, Xie replied, stating that the Ninghai warship could be allocated for use. The ship has a deadweight of 1,200 tons and is fully equipped, which can provide maximum service for the survey team. It is now reported that the survey team will be organized by the institute at the end of March after personnel are assigned, and will depart at the beginning of April to start the first year of work in the first region.</p>
<h3 id="e172">British Consulate Continues to Try the Case of a British Woman Manufacturing Narcotics <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Monthly Income of 400 Yuan, Expenses of More Than 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Where Does the Shortfall Come From? Considered Suspicious</p>
<p>According to the "Da Mei Evening News," the case of the wife of Johnson, a British resident at 361 Avenue Foch, being accused of illegally manufacturing narcotics in her residence was heard again by the police court of the British Consulate this morning (the 23rd). First, the defendant's lawyer, Blanc, cross-examined Walker, a chemist from the Public Health Department of the Municipal Council, to prove that the defendant could not hear the sound or smell the odor when the machine for manufacturing narcotics was in operation. Then, Western Detective Dunn testified that when he entered the main room that day, he saw thick carpets on the floor, and a carpet was also laid on the ladder. A box containing batteries was placed under a Chinese mattress that was about half an inch thick. After the testimony, Blanc stated that his client was completely unaware of the manufacturing of narcotics in her home until the detectives discovered the machine for manufacturing narcotics in the main room of her home. Now, those who had been to her home in December can be invited to testify that they had never seen anything suspicious or smelled anything unusual. Blanc then cross-examined the defendant. The defendant looked nervous and testified that she was 36 years old and came to China in early 1914. She taught in Tianjin for seven and a half years, and then came to Shanghai to teach for several years. Later, she went to Yantai and Weihaiwei to work as a teacher for several months. In 1925, she returned to Shanghai and taught English at two Chinese schools. In 1931, she married Johnson. Her husband was an Australian who had served in the Australian Navy. After marriage, they lived together on Rue Seymore. In the summer of 1932, her husband worked for a shipping company. In September of the same year, they went to England together, coming to China on the Shandong steamship. Her husband then lost his job for more than a year. Later, he helped the Dalu Industrial Company prepare to purchase a ship, but he was not paid. Last December, the company hired him to go to England to sail the purchased ship to China, with a monthly salary of 400 yuan. He departed from Shanghai on December 11. Her husband wanted to do business in Shanghai during his unemployment, but he failed. His father helped him with 150 pounds sterling. Last year, a certain charity organization did lend him money to help him with his urgent needs. Before departing for England, the Dalu Industrial Company paid him 1,000 yuan. Her husband had no bank savings. When she left Shanghai, she promised to remit money at any time to cover household expenses. Her husband bought a car in early December of last year, paying 255 yuan per month. The lease for the residence on Avenue Foch was for one year, with a monthly rent of 390 yuan. The rent was indeed high, but she loved it because it had a large garden and clean air. She planned to sublet it to others in the summer. Her husband had hired a cook, a shop assistant, a driver, and a "Xiao Xixue," each with a monthly salary of 100 yuan, all recommended by a certain Chinese engineer known to her husband. According to the defendant's testimony, Johnson's household expenses, excluding food and clothing, were 1,045 yuan per month, while her monthly income was only 400 yuan. The defendant could not explain where the monthly shortfall came from. It is reported that Johnson departed from England for Shanghai on January 21. According to a telegram he sent to his lawyer, his wife was unaware of the situation. After he arrives in Shanghai, he plans to investigate the servants he hired, and the truth will come to light.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Car Driver Causes Accident, Injuring Pedestrians <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Sent to Two Hospitals in Nanshi for Treatment</p>
<p>A Worker Dies from His Injuries</p>
<p>| The Driver Who Caused the Accident Was Handed Over to the Bureau for Legal Action |</p>
<p>The public bus operated by the Municipal Public Utility Bureau had a breakdown at Xiaonanmen Station at around 3 PM yesterday, so the bureau sent Lu A'er (age 29), a native of Haimen driving vehicle No. 82, to the scene to repair it. While driving north to south on Minguo Road outside Xiaobeimen in Nanshi, he carelessly crashed into Wang Deqing (age 28), a native of Nanjing residing at No. 15 Fenqingfang, next to Xiafeifang on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, who was riding bicycle No. 4078. The bicycle was not only damaged, but Wang's right leg was also crushed, bleeding profusely, and he was seriously injured. Lu, panicking, crashed into Shen Renhua (age 32), a native of Yancheng, pulling a rickshaw and Li Weichuan (age 50), a native of Ningbo, as well as Xu Tiande (age 36), a native of Yancheng, pulling a rickshaw with a female passenger near the Huashang tram station on Fangbang Bridge. The male passenger's waist and the female passenger's head were injured on both sides. They immediately hired rickshaws and went to the hospital for treatment. In addition to the rickshaw puller Shen Renhua injuring his left hand and buttocks, and Xu Tiande injuring his left foot and internally, Kong Luoshi, a 78-year-old woman from Zhenjiang, was injured on her right hand and both sides of her head, as well as Shen A'bin, a native of Lishui pushing a cart on Broadway in Hongkou, on his face, and another worker whose name is unknown. The driver, Lu A'er, was taken into custody by police officer Zhang Xuezeng from Post No. 17. Police officer Zhang Xuezeng from Post No. 16 used the telephone to notify the Western District Fire Brigade to dispatch an ambulance to send the seriously injured worker, whose name is unknown, to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, and sent Huang Fuqing, the old woman Kong Laosi, and cart pusher Shen A'bin to Qu Zhibu Hospital on Penglai Road for treatment. The rickshaw pullers Shen Renhua and Xu Tiande were slightly injured and were sent to Qu Zhibu Hospital for treatment after the police officer registered their cases. It is reported that the driver, Lu A'er, has been handed over to the General Bureau for legal action. However, the worker, whose name is unknown, died shortly after being sent to Shanghai Hospital due to serious injuries.</p>

<p>Long Kehou's Body Was Examined Yesterday</p>
<p>Long Kehou, 32, a native of Huai'an and former director of the Anhui Provincial Military Law Department, resided at No. 16 Jingyuli, Weihaiwei Road. Recently, he suffered from severe lung disease. Although he had consulted famous Chinese and Western doctors, it was ineffective. An X-ray examination revealed that his lungs were irreparably ulcerated. On the day before, Long felt unbearable pain due to this disease and developed suicidal thoughts. At around 4 PM, while his family members were not in the room, he took his own pistol and fired a shot at his throat. After Xu Ziyu, the attendant, heard the sound and went to check, he found Long lying in a pool of blood. He immediately notified his wife, Qin, who sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly thereafter. The hospital reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived at the office to examine the body.

<p>Chen Wanpeng Fined 500 Yuan for Smoking Opium</p>
<p>Chen Wanpeng (aka Jingzhang), a runner for Yongfeng Qianzhuang from Shaoxing, had an opium addiction. He kept a full set of opium paraphernalia in his residence at No. 9, Lane 170, Carter Road. He would often recline on a couch, indulging in opium smoke. This was discovered by Inspector Gai Wen of the Fourth Detective Squad of the Xinzha Police Station and Detective Xing Peisong, who reported it to the First Special Court and obtained a search warrant. They went to arrest Chen and confiscated six opium pipes, six opium lamps, twelve opium bowls, twenty-four taels of raw opium, three jars of opium paste, weighing five pounds and six ounces, two containers of opium ash, three trays, one pair of pliers, five needles, three pipe racks, etc. The confiscated opium paraphernalia was extremely luxurious. One opium pipe in particular was an unparalleled masterpiece. The stem and bowl were fully inlaid with silver, engraved with delicate flowers, and had a silver-engraved seven-character poem, inlaid with diamonds, emeralds, and other precious stones. It was of considerable value. All of it was taken to the police station. The police chief allowed Chen to be released on bail of 255 yuan. Yesterday morning, Wu Tingqi, a judge from the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, held a trial. The defendant, Chen Wanpeng, hired two lawyers to present the case, stating that some of the confiscated opium paraphernalia belonged to Feng, a tenant downstairs. The defendant previously had a stomach illness, so he sometimes smoked opium, but he did not open the lamp for others to smoke, etc. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Wu Tingqi sentenced Chen Wanpeng to a fine of 500 yuan for possessing opium and opium paraphernalia. If he could not pay the fine, he would be imprisoned at a rate of three yuan per day. The raw opium, opium paste, and opium paraphernalia were confiscated.</p>

<p>Continued Hearing Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>Zhang Guanghua, a 27-year-old native of Henan, and his 18-year-old younger brother, Zhang Guangzhou, had been living together in a three-story pavilion room at No. 24 Chongdefang, Minguo Road outside Xiaobeimen in the French Concession, for more than a year. At 4:00 AM on November 23 of last year, Zhang Guangzhou was suddenly killed by a sharp blade cutting off his head and neck. Zhang Guanghua also suffered five or six knife wounds to his head and ran out screaming for help. The second landlord notified the police, who took Guanghua to the police station and sent him to the hospital for treatment. After he recovered and was interrogated, the reason for the killing was revealed. Guangzhou attacked his brother with a knife, but Guanghua fought back in self-defense and killed his brother. Guanghua was transferred to the Second Special Court, and the public prosecutor filed a lawsuit against Zhang Guanghua for murder. Judge Xiong Huiping held a court hearing and interrogated him. Zhang Guanghua flatly denied killing his brother, saying that he felt someone killing his brother in his sleep, first cutting his head and then running out screaming for help because there were no electric lights, so he could not clearly see the murderer's face. He was instructed to reschedule the hearing. In the rescheduled hearing, the presiding judge went to the scene of the incident to investigate the situation. It has been reported in the previous two newspapers. Yesterday, another continued hearing was held. Judge Xiong and Clerk Tao Zongkan specially opened the Second Criminal Court for the hearing. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuan appeared in court on behalf of the Police Department, and the official asked the defendant questions. Zhang still denied killing his brother. The statements he made were the same as those recorded in the previous report and will not be repeated. The court believed that the investigation of both facts and evidence had been completed. Because the defense lawyer representing the defendant went to the Suzhou High Court yesterday to appear in court, he requested a reschedule in advance, so he could not begin the argument. The official instructed to reschedule the hearing to 1:30 PM on the 25th (tomorrow). The defendant was still sent back to the detention center.</p>

For now, it is still difficult to talk about.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Rice Prices Are Falling, Need to See Further Reduction <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Due to Many Orders for Foreign Rice, Wholesalers Are Discouraged</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News, rice prices in this city have fallen in recent days due to the cold weather and river freezing, as well as the receding tide, which has cut off the river route in the Jiwangmiao area of ​​West Shanghai, resulting in a shortage of goods. Yesterday, Jiang Shizhi of the Shanghai North Rice Transport Merchants Association went to the Fifth Patrol Team of the Beixinjing Water Patrol. The team sent personnel to the Yujidun Police Station to supervise the patrolmen and try to clear the passage. As a result, the number of ships arriving in Zhabei suddenly increased yesterday, reaching sixty or seventy. However, sales were flat, resulting in a drop of one jiao in each cargo. Changbang Head Rice was 13.4 yuan, Wuxi No. 2 was 12.5 to 11.7 yuan, Su Geng was 11 to 10.8 yuan, and Foreign Rice was 12.3 to 11.5 yuan. According to rice industry observations, the reason for this surge in goods is that the Social Bureau announced many orders for foreign rice, causing wholesalers to lose confidence and sell off their goods. If there are more goods arriving today and tomorrow, it is expected that the rice price will decrease by one jiao before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Representatives Will Jointly Petition and Negotiate with the Police Station</p>
<p>The New Voice Society reported that since the Public Concession’s Bureau of Public Works repeatedly sent personnel to evict fruit vendors on various roads, representatives from various sections have repeatedly petitioned Mr. He DeKui, the Chinese member of the Bureau of Public Works. Mr. He replied that he would allow them to operate. However, the police continued to crack down on vendors in the Dongxin Bridge and Songjiang Lane areas, not allowing them to operate, resulting in the dispersal of most of the vendors there. Yesterday, the Bureau of Public Works sent Western police to evict vendors in the Shanxi Road area. Therefore, yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, vendors from that area sent representatives He Genrong, Zhu Rongcai, Zhong Songtao, and others to the political department of the Bureau of Public Works to petition, requesting permission to operate. They were received by Superintendent Robertson and Detective Xue Zhiliang, who replied that if all vendors changed to carrying their goods on their shoulders, there would be no further crackdown. The representatives were satisfied and left, and all vendors changed to carrying their goods on their shoulders. However, at about 1:00 PM, detectives came to evict them again. Therefore, in the afternoon at 3:00 PM, the vendors again sent the original representatives to petition Mr. He DeKui. Mr. He also replied that after changing to shoulder carrying, if the police evicted them, they could move to another location. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 PM, Western police officers No. 146 and No. 188 still interfered. The vendors fled to stores, and Western police officer No. 188 rushed to beat them, but the stores intervened and stopped him. Currently, the representatives of the area plan to jointly negotiate with the police station with the vendors from Dongxin Bridge.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways Instructs the Railway Bureau to Comply</p>
<p>The Joint Railway Administration recently received Instruction No. 137 from the Ministry of Railways, which stated that the Nanjing Fan and Hat Industry Association submitted a report stating that the goods produced by the members of the association are handmade products with very low prices. The highest wholesale price of satin hats is around 40 cents, and the lowest is only 20 cents. However, the railway classifies satin hats as second class and woolen cloth hats as fourth class. Due to the high freight costs, sales have been sluggish. The association requested a reduction in freight rates. According to the regulations of the cargo classification table, domestically produced satin hats should be charged freight according to the fourth class for ordinary goods. If the association's report that satin hats are charged as second class is true, then the carrier is in error. It is hereby ordered that all railways should charge domestically produced satin hats according to the fourth class. In addition to separate orders and approvals, you are hereby notified.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating that Article 18 of the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Physicians (Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners) in This City" stipulates that "Each medical clinic's business license should be submitted for annual inspection and re-issuance. Those who fail to submit it for inspection within the deadline will be fined up to five yuan." Recently, the bureau has repeatedly received reports from registered physicians stating that they were unable to comply with the regulations and submit their licenses for inspection within the deadline, either due to the impact of previous wars or due to a lack of understanding of the license inspection deadline. They requested permission to waive the fine and re-inspect the licenses in order to resume their practices. In order to rectify and provide relief, the bureau has submitted a proposal to the municipal government for approval to amend Article 18 of the original regulations to "Each medical clinic's business license should be displayed in a prominent place for public viewing and should be submitted to the Municipal Health Bureau for annual inspection and re-issuance from February 1st to the end of March each year. Those who fail to submit it for inspection within the deadline will be fined up to five yuan each time." With the approval of the municipal government, all medical business licenses that have not been submitted for inspection in the past will be granted a one-time exemption from fines and re-inspection from January 20th to the end of March of this year to show compassion. Those who still fail to comply with the regulations and submit their licenses for inspection after the deadline will be punished according to the regulations. This notice is hereby issued.</p>

<p>Six-Month Sentence Suspended for Three Years</p>
<p>Zhou Exuan, the son of Zhou Weishi, a wealthy Suzhou businessman in Shanghai, indulged in frivolous pleasures and formed an indissoluble bond with the famous prostitute Zhang Zhuying. Exuan then rented a house to hide her. When Weishi learned that Zhang had given birth to a son, he immediately dissolved the small family. Exuan, intimidated by his father's stern reputation, dared not protect her and allowed Zhang to marry someone else. However, Exuan provided monthly funds for the upbringing of their son, Dayuan, who was raised by Zhang. Until the winter of the year before last, when Dayuan was ten years old, the education and upbringing funds suddenly stopped being provided. Zhang, in her capacity as Dayuan's legal guardian, sued Exuan for abandoning his biological son in the First Special District Court. However, the original lawsuit was dismissed in the first instance. Zhang was unwilling to accept this and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After the second instance concluded, Zhou Exuan was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for abandonment. Zhou also claimed to be dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court. The lawsuit has been ongoing for a year now. It is now learned that the third instance of the Supreme Court has also announced its verdict in recent days, rejecting Zhou Exuan's appeal. However, the six-month sentence imposed by the second instance has been suspended for three years.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Catalogue of Scripts from the Hemu Lu Published <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Divided into Thirty-Four Categories, Totaling More Than Three Thousand Volumes</p>
<p>Book Price Six Yuan, Sold at Shanghai Bank</p>
<p>Mr. Song Chunfang, a former professor at Peking University, is a great enthusiast of opera and drama. He has explored almost ten thousand volumes of secret books from maps and private treasures. Recently, he compiled his collection of Chinese and foreign operas and dramas into a book called "Catalogue of Scripts from the Hemu Lu," totaling more than three thousand types, divided into several categories, such as China, Japan, India, Turkey, Eastern Theatre, Russia, Poland, Spain, Norway, Commentary on Chinese Drama, New Theatre Movement, Playwriting, Modern Drama, Film, Dramatic Criticism, Opera, Acting, History of Drama, etc., with a total of thirty-four categories including appendices. Among them, the rare editions are those that are not seen outside. In his preface, he said, "Since I first went west, I listened to lectures in famous cities and explored books in neighboring countries. What I liked at that time was all in opera and drama. I have explored almost ten thousand volumes of secret books from maps and private treasures. In 1915, I first traveled to Paris and entered the Bibliothegue de l'Opera, where I stayed for three months, forgetting to return. In 1917, I returned to Shanghai, chose what I loved, and brought it back with me. In 1921, I went abroad again and passed through Germany and Austria. At that time, the Great War had just ended and currency values had fallen. I exhausted my savings and bundled them up. Later, due to illness, they were shelved. For the past five or six years, I have been traveling back and forth between Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Tianjin, without a settled place. Last year, I spent four thousand yuan to build Hemu Lu by the seaside in Qingdao, gathering books in it. This spring, I resigned from my position as a Qingdao city councilor and wrote the catalogue on my door, which took a month to complete. In the past twenty years, I have worked hard to search for and acquire no more than three thousand volumes. My wealth and talent are insufficient, and my knowledge is limited. It is not surprising. Fortunately, what I have collected is limited to one category, so it is easier to choose and separate. Even this small collection is rare. In terms of opera and drama, it provides a rough overview. This collection may be the best in China. Compared to the Bibliothegue de l'Opera in Paris, it is only one percent. As for the collection of the Four Treasuries, picking up what has been lost, and filling the shelves with books, it is a public affair and not something that individuals can do. Moreover, accumulation is gradual, and dispersal is impermanent. Not to mention the distant past, recent examples include the Haiyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng and the Ce Hai Tower in Yangzhou, the elites of generations, eventually scattered and lost. What I have now may not be preserved forever, especially with the flames of war looming. After the compilation was completed, I was filled with anxiety, so I recorded my feelings as follows." From this, we can see the difficulty of searching and the precision of storage. This catalogue is bound in one volume and sells for six yuan, sold at the Shanghai Bank Library.</p>

Mr. Li then took the prizes worth more than ten yuan and slowly left. Gu Zhongying from Henglong Store in Dadongmen composed a five-character poem on the spot, saying, "I grieve that money flows overseas, I am moved by this pitch-pot, I tell the like-minded, it's good to support national goods." In addition, "Benbo," who signed his name from 1231 Xinzha Road, wrote a poem saying, "Do you know the leaking cup? Recovery depends on this pot, I urge patriots, to cooperate and support." There were also many excellent works sent by "Liuyi Laoren" and "Youxin Ren", which were very beautiful. It is said that the person in charge of the Shanghai National Products Company has compiled the poems and essays and will hire famous poets to judge them before giving away items.</p>

The police then reported back to the police station, which instructed the local bailiff Zhu Yuezhai to report to the local court to request an autopsy. Prosecutor Wu Deyi, along with the coroner, arrived at the scene. The deceased was wearing a dark blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers. Next to the body on the ground was a dark brown wool coat.

<p>Regarding the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, a native of Ningbo, in front of the Great World at approximately 1:00 AM on June 18th of last year, in which a passerby was killed by a stray bullet, the French police apprehended Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing and the main instigator, at the Central Hotel on Wuma Road on the evening of December 13th of last year. He was brought to face the accomplices who had been previously apprehended and sentenced to imprisonment, Zhao Guangfu of Yangzhou and Zhang Tinggui (nicknamed "Little Four") of Funing, for questioning. After the investigation was concluded, he was sent to the Second Special District Court. The police department filed a public prosecution for premeditated murder. Judge Xiong Huiping held several hearings and, after deliberation, ordered a change of date for further hearing, pending an investigation report from Wuchang First Prison. The details had been reported in previous issues. Yesterday, the date for another hearing arrived. The defendant hired attorney Shen Xingxia for defense. At 2:00 PM, Judge Xiong, accompanied by Clerk Tao, specially opened the Second Criminal Court for the hearing. Attorney Yuan Jiahong represented the police department in court.

<p>On the morning of January 21st, at approximately 5:00 AM, Chen Shaowu's home at 17 Fengboli, Xiexu Road in the South City, was robbed of 80 Mexican silver dollars and Chen Shaowu and his wife, Chen Du, were injured by the robbers. Details were reported in this newspaper. It is learned that the case was considered important by Li, the chief of the West Gate Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, as it involved robbery and injury. Therefore, he strictly ordered Shen Wenda, the squad leader of the investigation team stationed at the branch, to purchase leads to investigate the escaped thieves. The thieves were all natives of Suqian, Chen Shaowu's hometown, and were hiding in the Yangjiadu area of ​​Pudong. Investigation squad leader Shen Wenda immediately sent team leaders Fang Lingen, detectives Bian Wenguang, Yang Yishan, Yang Jisheng, Liu Wenhui, and others in disguise to Pudong. Together with the local police station, they apprehended Liu Kaisheng (also known as Kui Sheng) (also known as Liu Huzi) in a thatched house in Xinyongtang, Yangjiadu, Pudong. He confessed that his accomplices were Zhang Dengshan, Ma Tiancai, Wu Tingxi (also known as "Little Otter"), and three others. The detectives apprehended Zhang Dengshan, Ma Tiancai, Wu Tingxi, and suspect Xu Longzi separately and brought them to the bureau.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Goods Industry Association held a quarterly luncheon and executive committee meeting at the restaurant on the top floor of the Taikang Company headquarters on Nanjing Road. Le Fucheng was elected as the chairman.

The conversion method was considered to be a major matter, and a general meeting will be convened again to discuss and determine the standard conversion number so that everyone can abide by it and avoid discrepancies. (2) Member Guanshengyuan sent a letter requesting an explanation of whether the invoice books of the three-part form should be affixed with stamps separately for each part and the cover. It was resolved that, apart from the first part, which should be affixed with stamps without any doubt, the rest should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation, and a notice will be issued after approval for compliance. (3) The new licenses and delivery certificates for the 24th year of the Health Bureau have been received. It was resolved to send a letter to each factory to come to the association to receive them.

<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Association sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office yesterday stating that it had received a letter from the Hangzhou National Products Factory Association, which stated that Wan Zhong Company had sent a letter stating that after participating in the Ningxian National Exhibition, it took the remaining goods on a ship from Ningbo to Shanghai. When it arrived in Shanghai, the goods were detained by customs officers. It was requested to forward a letter for negotiation. The association confirmed that the goods carried by the company were the remaining items from participating in the exhibition. How the customs office should negotiate, it was hoped that the association would handle it nearby. After the association sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Service, it received a reply stating that the goods seized on the ship were brought in privately by the crew members and would be released upon payment of a fine of one times the value of the goods, together with the transit tax. The Wan Zhong Company went to Ningbo to participate in the exhibition this time under the leadership of the Hangzhou National Products Factory Association. When it opened, the goods from Hangzhou to Ningbo were transported by the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and were exempt from taxes according to regulations. This time, the company's representative carried them with him and returned to Hangzhou via Shanghai. The representative was unfamiliar with the customs regulations, which led to this mistake. The situation is still excusable. It is requested that the superintendent examine and approve the transfer to the Jianghai Customs Service to exempt them from punishment and return the detained products in full in order to maintain the national products salvation movement. It is truly in the public interest.</p>

At the same time, they were ordered to immediately remove the hanging colored plaques. It is reported that the association plans to publish the details in the newspaper to prevent other companies from repeating the same mistake.</p>

<p>The Public Rickshaw Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council has, since handling the registration of public rickshaw pullers, yesterday issued a set of Rickshaw Puller Guidelines, divided into twenty-nine articles. The full text is transcribed below:</p>
<p>(1) When you are pulling the rickshaw, you must carry your license with you at all times. If you are going out, you can hand the license over to the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Puller Licensing Office for safekeeping to avoid losing it. When you return, you can reclaim it from the original licensing office.</p>
<p>(2) The license armband must be worn on your left arm in a visible place at all times, so that the number can be seen clearly.</p>
<p>(3) You must always obey the traffic directions of the police. The rickshaw owner will tell you about the Municipal Council's traffic regulations, and you must comply.</p>
<p>(4) When your rickshaw is stopped or when passengers are boarding, you must bring the rickshaw close to the side of the road and must not approach the roadside marked with red lines or paved with black and white tiles.</p>
<p>(5) You must pay attention to and obey all police signals.</p>
<p>(6) You must not run in the middle of the road, but should try to walk as close to the left side of the road as possible.</p>
<p>(7) If you have difficulties with the fare, you should report to the nearest policeman or nearby police station for a proper resolution.</p>
<p>(8) When pulling a rickshaw, you must form a single line and cannot have two or three rickshaws running side by side.</p>
<p>(9) You must obey the orders of the police on duty.</p>
<p>(10) If your passenger wants to get out in front of a shop on a busy street, you cannot stop the rickshaw in front of the shop, but should stop in a nearby alley or side street.</p>
<p>(11) If a passenger in your rickshaw becomes ill or dies, report it to the police and ask for their help, or take the passenger to the nearest police station.</p>
<p>(12) Your rickshaw must not carry vegetable market items or other goods that could soil the rickshaw.</p>
<p>(13) When pulling a rickshaw, if you want to turn, you must first make a hand signal to indicate the direction you are turning.</p>
<p>(14) When you want to turn right, you cannot take a shortcut, but must make a wide turn.</p>
<p>(15) Before you stop, you must raise your hand above your head to notify approaching vehicles.</p>
<p>(16) If you encounter an accident, you should stop to help and wait for the police to arrive on the scene to take orders. If there is no policeman nearby, you should immediately report to the nearest police station.</p>
<p>(17) All vehicles that need to stop on Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, or Route Ghisi, east of Route Ma, must have the left side of the rickshaw close to the roadside.</p>
<p>(18) From sunset to sunrise, you must keep the rickshaw lamp lit.</p>
<p>(19) No vehicle may stop on Nanjing Road for more than thirty minutes between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. daily, except on Sundays and holidays.</p>
<p>(20) You cannot pull an empty rickshaw on Nanjing Road. If your passenger gets out on Nanjing Road, then you must return home from a nearby side street.</p>
<p>(21) You cannot compete for or solicit business, nor can you rush across the road to greet customers.</p>
<p>(22) Items left behind by passengers in the rickshaw must be immediately taken to the nearest police station.</p>
<p>(23) When not in use, the rickshaw door cloth should be placed in the bucket (i.e., the passenger compartment), and you should pay attention to whether the number painted on the door cloth is the same as the plate number.</p>
<p>(24) After you obtain a rickshaw puller's license, you can rent a rickshaw from the rickshaw owner you prefer. At the same time, the rickshaw owner can also rent the rickshaw to the rickshaw puller he prefers. However, we hope that there will be harmonious work between rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers. When you are about to leave Shanghai, or if you want to change careers and no longer pull a rickshaw, you must notify the rickshaw owner, and he can help you hand over your license and armband to the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Puller Licensing Office for safekeeping.</p>
<p>(25) The Rickshaw Puller Mutual Aid Society was established for your benefit. Your dues of three and a half cents (about eleven copper coins) per shift are used to fund the society. Currently, two society locations have been opened on Dong Jiaxing Road and Route Pottier. In the near future, other locations will continue to be established. The licensing fee of one yuan has already been paid to the Municipal Council by the Mutual Aid Society on your behalf.</p>
<p>(26) The fare schedule on the rickshaw is for passengers to see. If you are willing to charge less, you can do so.</p>
<p>(27) After a shift, the rickshaw should be returned to the rickshaw company and cleaned thoroughly.</p>
<p>(28) The maximum daily rickshaw rental, including the Rickshaw Puller Mutual Aid Society dues, is eighty-five cents. If the rickshaw owner wants to charge you more, you can report it to the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee. If you owe the rickshaw owner a debt, rent, or owe money to the labor union, then you must pay it separately from the rickshaw rental, and you should obtain a separate receipt for the payment. Also, in the event of such incidents, the rickshaw owner must have a written document stating the amount of debt owed by the rickshaw puller, etc. Afterwards, each repayment of debt or other payments by the rickshaw puller must be recorded in detail for inspection by the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>(29) You must absolutely comply with the Rickshaw Puller License Regulations. If you violate any article, your license will be revoked, and then you will have no chance to pull a rickshaw again.</p>

<p>London Chinese Art Exhibition Regarding Selection and Insurance Issues</p>
<p>▲ 籌委會函復陶孟和等</p>
<p>The Organizing Committee Responds to Tao Menghe and Others</p>
<p>▲ 擇要說明未嘗涉苟且</p>
<p>A Concise Explanation: No Negligence Involved</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd) Regarding the London Chinese Art Exhibition, academics such as Tao Menghe have expressed opinions on issues such as selection and insurance. The Organizing Committee recently responded to Tao et al. in a letter, stating: "We recently read in the January 20th Ta Kung Pao the concerns of Mr. and others regarding the London Art Exhibition and the importance of caution. Your intentions are commendable, but the actual situation may not be fully understood. Therefore, we provide a concise explanation as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Origin: This matter was originally initiated by British academics, jointly with the British Royal Academy of Arts, who formally proposed to our country that the spirit of Chinese art, which transcends daily material life, has a stimulating effect on the Western people. In recent years, countries such as Italy and France have exhibited art in London, and the relationship between England and these countries has often been significantly enhanced. China, as the ancestor of Eastern culture, if it can hold an international exhibition in London, its effect will be significant. Under this consideration, our government has granted permission, and for the sake of caution, requested that the British government jointly host it. The British have formally declared their cooperation.</p>
<p>(2) Decision-Making Process: Before the government accepted the British proposal for this art exhibition, it first sought the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Old Palace Museum. The museum resolved to approve its principles. Subsequently, Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and other officials also issued documents and telegrams in support of the proposal. It was then successively submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Central Political Council for discussion and decision.</p>
<p>(3) Security Issues: This issue has also been repeatedly submitted to the Board of Directors of the Old Palace Museum for discussion. The board believes in focusing on practical safeguards and not being constrained by insurance. Later, this committee presented the issue to the Executive Yuan for approval, which decided that practical safety measures should be sought. The reason for the Yuan's decision was that insurance would require a large sum of insurance premiums and would not increase the safety of the items. The government attaches importance to the safety of the items themselves. In accordance with this decision, the committee solemnly telegraphed to the British that if there are no effective ways to guarantee safety, this matter may end in suspension. Therefore, in order to prevent piracy and other accidents, the British formally notified that they are willing to send warships to escort the postal ships carrying the exhibits. In order to reduce difficulties and accidents at the time of entry, the British side also intends not to inspect the items at customs when they arrive in England, but to inspect them together with Chinese representatives at the exhibition venue. In addition, the British Foreign Office stated that it is willing to do its best to assist in all other safety matters. Detailed measures have been drafted and will be announced separately.</p>
<p>(4) Right to Select Exhibits: The initial selection of exhibits will be handled by the Chinese side. The British committee members may make suggestions after the initial selection, but their suggestions will not take effect without the consent of the Chinese side. For items that the Chinese side believes cannot be taken abroad, they can certainly not be taken abroad. Therefore, the final selection right for the exhibits actually belongs to the Organizing Committee.</p>
<p>(5) Duration of Exhibits Leaving the Country: The total time required for the exhibits to leave the country this time, including the round trip and the time required for the exhibition in England, should be no more than ten months. The outside world's assumption that it will take a year and a half or two years is not true.</p>
<p>(6) Quantity and Quality of Exhibits Going Abroad: The ancient relics of the Old Palace Museum to be selected this time are limited to a very small portion of the ancient relics stored in Shanghai by the Old Palace Museum. Together with other items solicited, the total will be no more than 1,500 pieces. All national treasures with special historical value that have been recognized by special committees will not be taken abroad. This has been repeatedly resolved by the Board of Directors of the Old Palace Museum and this committee, and has been formally informed to the British committee members.</p>
<p>In summary, the government and this committee have handled this matter without any negligence."</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Strictly Orders the Closure of the Private North China College in Peiping</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 23rd) The person in charge of the Ministry of Education stated that the private North China College in Peiping was approved by the Ministry in August of the 20th year for temporary establishment, and listed several points, setting a one-year deadline for improvement. If it failed to comply within the deadline, the establishment would be revoked. In July of the 21st year, the Ministry sent personnel to inspect the college and found that the points for improvement in the previous order had not been complied with within the deadline, so the establishment was revoked immediately. In January of the previous year, the college was instructed to close down as soon as possible. In May, the Peiping Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was ordered to transfer instructions to stop enrollment. In August, the Social Affairs Bureau was telegraphed again to strictly prohibit enrollment. Last year, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect universities in Peiping and Tianjin, and conveniently went to the college to inspect the closure situation. No one was in charge of the college, the administration was not on track, and it was found that there were still violations of the order to enroll students. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Education ordered the Peiping Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to supervise the closure and strictly prohibit enrollment. Recently, reports from various parties have indicated that the college's operations have been largely in violation of the Ministry's orders and have cited facts, requesting the Ministry of Education to strictly prohibit it in order to avoid misleading young people.</p>

<p>Xu Beihong's Opinion on the Preparation of the Sino-British Art Exhibition</p>
<p>Xu Beihong expressed his feelings on the Sino-British Art Exhibition, saying, "In Shanghai slang, 'doing something sloppily' is called 'splitting foreign slop.' But this usually refers to individual actions. Even actions by legal persons rarely resemble 'splitting slop.' Only the Sino-British Art Exhibition, which sends national treasures to England without insurance, is truly 'splitting a big slop.' There is no precedent for this. China's attitude of unwavering trust and magnanimity is truly a creative genius, ultimately different from Shanghai tea and silk exporters.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the authorities on Eastern cultural relics in the United Kingdom are Lawrence Binyon, a famous poet, now a major curator at the British Museum, and Yetts, who is skilled in bronzes and is now a professor at the University of London. Neither of them was involved in this matter. Instead, the people sent to China are mostly merchants, which is truly puzzling.</p>
<p>Originally, people asked us to send things to display. Our purpose is to promote culture. I do not agree, because Chinese ancient civilization is universally recognized and does not need promotion. What the British want are things before 1800. If their intention is that China has had no culture since 1800, and even less so in modern times, there is no need for them to choose. Letting them choose is tantamount to declaring that there is no one in our country who knows anything. And the people who came to choose things are not the famous experts there. What is their intention? And we only trust a British diplomatic note and let them handle it. There is no insurance for shipping to England either. What a strange story, what a strange story!</p>
<p>I am one of the special committee members. Naturally, I have never interfered in other people's affairs. But I have witnessed the misfortune of this matter, and the government has solemnly promised it to others. As a modern person, I cannot help but call people's attention. Even something worth thousands of yuan must be insured, and a complete procedure must be negotiated to avoid the possibility of foreign sloppiness. And I hope that the wise government and the great diplomats stationed in England can reach an agreement before the Chinese antiquities are shipped, requiring Britain to come to China next year to hold a British art exhibition, displaying three or four hundred paintings and sculptures. And we declare that we want things after 1800, from Constable and Turner to modern times. It's not that we can't choose, but we let them choose themselves. We humbly ask the British culture for advice, without any hint of 'feeding the milk.'</p>
<p>Brothers Yi Peiji and Li Zongtong are gone. When they were invited to be the director and secretary-general of the Old Palace Museum, it was also believed that they were reliable. It was never expected that they would split such a big slop. It can be said that they were organized from the beginning. Our authorities are mostly gentlemen, but gentlemen can be deceived by their integrity. Those foreign merchants are still able to make ends meet. Don't let Yi Peiji and others sneer. Those innocent and foolish losses of national treasures are completely given away, and they themselves have not enjoyed any of it. Hmph, hmph!"</p>

<p>The Municipal Council Announces Continued Promotion of Chinese Education</p>
<p>▲ 上年度有中小學十所</p>
<p>Ten Primary and Secondary Schools Last Year</p>
<p>▲ 本年內擬再增辦三校</p>
<p>Three More Schools Planned to Be Added This Year</p>
<p>Among the educational affairs of the Public Concession Municipal Council, there are currently 16 council-run schools and 159 private schools that receive subsidies from the Municipal Council. The authorities in charge of education are the Education Committee and the Education Department.</p>
<p>▲ 擬定華人教育方針</p>
<p>Formulating Guidelines for Chinese Education</p>
<p>In 1931, the Education Committee recommended the promotion of Chinese education, planning to open two primary schools each year from that year to 1938, and to establish two girls' secondary schools in 1934. The existing public schools would be completely converted into secondary schools. As for foreign schools, no new schools would be added, only improvements to the existing school buildings and equipment would be made as appropriate. At the same time, subsidies would be granted to private schools with satisfactory operations.</p>
<p>▲ 一九三五擬增三校</p>
<p>Three Schools Planned to Be Added in 1935</p>
<p>However, it is noted that this plan has indeed been adopted in principle by the Board of Directors and the taxpayers' meeting, but it still contains many experimental aspects. It was decided to review the unfinished construction plans at the end of 1934. Due to financial difficulties last year, the matter of adding primary schools was temporarily postponed. At that time, it was suggested that the funds for running schools be used to expand subsidies. The Education Committee then resolved to maintain the current policy, increasing the number of schools as much as financially possible, while continuing to provide subsidies as before, and planned to add two Chinese boys' and girls' primary schools and a second girls' secondary school in 1935.</p>
<p>▲ 女子中學新校完成</p>
<p>New Girls' Secondary School Completed</p>
<p>It is noted that in early 1930, there were only six Chinese schools with only 2,391 students. Currently, there are ten schools with 5,815 students. Since the completion of the Gezhi Public School building in 1928, each secondary school has renovated and expanded its old school buildings to accommodate the increased number of students. Last year, a new three-story school building was built on Singapore Road for a girls' secondary school, which was completed and opened in February this year.</p>
<p>▲ 五處小學最近槪况</p>
<p>Recent Overview of Five Primary Schools</p>
<p>Before 1928, the Municipal Council did not run primary schools, only attaching primary school classes to various public schools. In that year, two primary schools were established. Now there are five schools. One is the Avenue Road Primary School, which was opened in rented houses in 1928 and moved to the old site of the Chinese Public School in 1930. It now has 608 students. One is the Jingzhou Road Primary School, which was also opened in rented houses on Huishan Road in 1928. A new school building was built on Jingzhou Road in 1933, which can accommodate 700 students. The sports field is shared with the Nie Zhongcheng Public School. One is the Xinzha Road Primary School, which was first opened on Edinburgh Road in 1930, and then built its own new school building. The number of students has increased from more than 500 to 725. One is the Ward Road Primary School, which was opened in rented houses after renovation in 1932. The number of students initially was only 242, but has now increased to 731. One is the Huishan Road Primary School, which currently only accepts female students, while male students are sent to Jingzhou Road. This school currently has 400 students.</p>
<p>▲ 創辦簡易補習學校</p>
<p>Establishment of Simple Remedial Schools</p>
<p>Although the Municipal Council has not been able to fully implement the original plan in a short period of time, it has added one girls' secondary school and five primary schools. How the future plans will be implemented depends on the financial situation. In order to remedy the lack of schooling for the children of industry and commerce, a remedial night school was specially established in the Jingzhou Road Primary School in October last year, enrolling more than 260 students, all aged between 14 and 20. The curriculum includes reading, composition, arithmetic, and common sense of citizenship and hygiene. The tuition fee is only five cents per quarter. The students of this school are very enthusiastic about attending, which also shows that such schools are in urgent need.</p>
<p>▲ 學童健康專員檢查</p>
<p>Health Commissioners Inspect School Children</p>
<p>Last year, the council-run schools were in good health. Although some students suffered from infectious diseases, they did not spread in the schools. At the end of 1933, the Health Department drafted a plan to implement physical examinations for students, and immediately started a pilot project in one primary school, finding many cases of eye diseases and skin diseases. The Board of Directors then approved an appropriation of more than 24,000 yuan and appointed a school health commissioner to examine the bodies of school children and provide appropriate treatment for those with diseases, starting with the Chinese primary schools in various districts.</p>
<p>▲ 補助學校一四五所</p>
<p>Subsidizing 145 Schools</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Council decided to subsidize private schools in 1931, the schools receiving subsidies must have satisfactory teaching achievements and comply with the conditions set by the Health Department. As for construction costs, no further assistance will be provided in the future. However, due to health and other needs, modifications to buildings that are required may still be considered. It is estimated that in 1934, there were 145 Chinese private schools subsidized by the Municipal Council, including 24 secondary schools and 121 primary schools, with a total of 31,222 students. The total amount of subsidies was 188,950 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ 外童學校建造新屋</p>
<p>Foreign Children's Schools Build New Houses</p>
<p>According to the report of the Director of Education, the school building of the Western District Western Children's Public School on Route Dufour was completed in January last year and can accommodate 450 students. The McTyeire Girls' School is also expected to be completed by the end of the year and can accommodate 500 students. As for private foreign schools, there are 14 schools subsidized by the Municipal Council, with a total of more than 5,400 students.</p>

<p>▲ Awarded Double First Place in Group and Individual Categories in the Current Joint Entrance Examination</p>
<p>The results of the fourth Shanghai Municipal Joint Entrance Examination for Secondary Schools have been officially announced by the Municipal Education Bureau. Guanghua Affiliated High School ranked first among the eighteen high schools in the city participating in the joint entrance examination, meeting the first criterion of the Municipal Education Bureau's reward standards, and will be awarded a prize accordingly. Feng Jifan, a student of the school, ranked first among the more than one hundred and fifty high school students participating in the joint entrance examination, meeting the second criterion of the Municipal Education Bureau's reward standards and will be given a certificate of merit accordingly. In past joint entrance examination results, it was unprecedented for one school to simultaneously win both the group and individual first places. This is because the school's curriculum is rigorous on a daily basis, hence this achievement. It is said that the school will further reorganize from the next semester onwards. The girls will move into new dormitories, and training will be strictly enforced. The gymnasium and science museum are already being prepared for construction. The cooperative will expand its scope, add a credit cooperative, and also plans to construct facilities, all of which are scheduled to be completed before the school's tenth anniversary in June this year.</p>

The survey has been compiled into a thick volume called "Shanghai University, Middle and Primary School Survey Record," published by Longwen Bookstore in Dananmen. Mr. Xu is now focusing on surveying universities, middle and primary schools nationwide, including school names, addresses, establishment dates, whether public or private, whether school buildings are self-built or leased, the amount of regular expenses per term, departments and grades, names of current principals and longest-serving faculty members, number of faculty and staff, student numbers, the school's philosophy, library information, and names of librarians. This project has been underway for over a year and is scheduled for publication this autumn. The completion of this book has been greatly supported by over 1,600 education bureau chiefs and education department heads nationwide.</p>

<p>▲ Tokyo Overseas Chinese Elementary School to Build School Buildings: Although there are quite a few overseas Chinese students in Japan, most of them are concentrated in major ports such as Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe. As for the Tokyo area, due to the small number of Chinese businessmen and the majority of workers, the establishment of an overseas Chinese elementary school has been limited by economic constraints. Although Wu Ding and others initiated the establishment of a Chinese elementary school in Tokyo several years ago, it was only affiliated with the Chinese Youth Association in Japan due to financial difficulties. Recently, Mr. Wu has been actively seeking support, and various parties have provided considerable assistance. Zhou Xianwen, the Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan, and other wealthy overseas Chinese have made donations. Starting this year, in addition to hiring a full-time principal and faculty, the construction of a school building will begin, which will greatly benefit the children of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>▲ Zhou Xianwen Inspects School Affairs in Sendai: Zhou Xianwen, the Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan, in order to understand the living conditions of students studying in various parts of Japan, recently visited Sendai to inspect school affairs with Zhu Youxian, an official from the office.

<p>Qingguang Revitalized, the Artillery's First Shot Misfired</p>
<p>At the beginning of the encounter, the Artillery was quite impressive. Within the first ten minutes, they led Qingguang 9 to 7. But the tide turned, and after Qingguang's Tan Dahua scored on a free throw to tie the score at 9-9, the older Tan and the younger Dong took advantage of opportunities on both sides, taking a 13-9 lead. From then on, stray bullets frequently flew over the Artillery's basket, allowing Qingguang's veterans and new soldiers to do as they pleased, sailing smoothly to a 56-25 victory.</p>

<p>Customs Gold Plummets</p>
<p>Selling Sentiment Intensifies in Gold Market</p>
<p>Bulls Once Pushed to 60 Yuan</p>
<p>Ultimately Only a Minor Dip of 8 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a sharp decline in the Central Bank's customs gold unit, which strengthened the selling sentiment. Adding to this, banks had a strong appetite for selling, resulting in a further decline. At one point, the price even broke through the 60 yuan mark. However, with the US Supreme Court about to rule on the gold clause, there was strong demand from buyers of US currency. After a period of easing, the foreign exchange market tightened, making it easier for the gold market to rebound. In the early morning, overseas silver markets were stable in both London and New York. The forward silver market in Montevideo was also stable, with little fluctuation in exchange rates. London spot gold rose by half a penny. In pre-market trading, prices opened steadily at around 63 yuan. Major players took advantage of the high prices to supply. When the Central Bank's official rates were announced, both the British and American rates rose, but the customs gold unit suddenly fell by 1.5 fen. The standard price for bidding gold was reduced to 985.5 yuan, weakening the situation and causing it to decline. The market opened slightly lower in the morning. After the opening, supply and demand balanced, and the market remained stable at first. As banks aggressively sold, prices fell. Anticipating that the HSBC exchange rates for both British and American currencies would be stable, there was some rebound. Later, the banks' appetite for selling continued to be strong, and the foreign exchange market remained loose, leading to increased selling pressure. Major players took advantage of the situation to sell aggressively. At intervals, some bulls emerged, causing the price to gradually fall back into the 60 yuan range. The silver balancing tax was announced unchanged, still levied at 6%. With the British exchange rate calculated at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 78125, market confidence remained stable, leading to contention around the 60 yuan mark. Subsequently, HSBC and Chase Manhattan took advantage of the low prices to buy, and Chinese merchants regained their buying appetite, causing the foreign exchange market to tighten. Rumors of the Central Bank intervening in the spot market caused a surge of buyers, leading to a rebound. However, there was considerable fluctuation along the way. At this time, the Guangdong group and others made some purchases, seemingly strengthening the market. Later, as banks continued to sell at high prices, the market declined again. Large short sellers also frequently applied pressure, causing the noon close to feel weak. Throughout the morning, the market saw frequent fluctuations, but the overall trend remained mediocre. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 962.2 yuan, down 8 jiao from the previous close. Hengxing and Yongli advanced to 2.7 yuan. Dafa, Yongchun, Yuan, and Yong sold, falling to 2.1 yuan. Hengyu and Dacheng advanced again, rising to 3 yuan. Fuxing, Yongda, Decheng, Dafa, Yongding, Kangfu, and Chang sold gold bars. Zhengjin sold US dollars for March at 87.5, falling to 1 yuan. Dafa, Yongda, Decheng, Hengyu, Yongli, Fuchang, Zhaofeng, and Chang took advantage of the low prices to purchase bars. Anticipating that the HSBC exchange rate would remain unchanged, it rose to 2.3 yuan. Mitsui and McCallum sold US dollars for March at 87.5. Zhejiang sold US dollars for January at 35.5 yuan. Wanxing, Dafeng, Dafa, Yongtong, Fuda, Decheng, Qianchang, Xiangyifeng, Yongheng, Yuqing, Fayong, and others sold bars, falling to 59.7 yuan. The announcement that the silver balancing tax would remain unchanged caused a slight rise. Yongli and Fuyu maintained support at low prices. Wanxing, Qianchang, and Xiang then sold assets, struggling around the 60 yuan mark. HSBC entered US dollars for January at half a yuan, and it was difficult to settle shillings for April at .0625. Yuanmao, Yongchang, Daheng, Yuyu, Xiangfeng, Guangfeng, Chang, Dafa, Yongchun, Yuan, Yuda, Hengxing, and Hengxingyuan bought aggressively. Chase Manhattan entered US dollars for February at 1.25. Chinese merchants such as the Guangdong group and Fuchang also entered. The US dollar domestic market suddenly tightened, rebounding to 3.5 yuan. There were rumors that the Central Bank was intervening in the spot market with 280 bars at a price of 955 yuan, stimulating buying interest. Hengyu, Wanxing, Fuyu, and Tianfeng took advantage of the high prices to sell, retreating to 2.4 yuan. Hengxingyuan, Shengsheng, Dada, Decheng, Hengxing, and others continued to buy, rising again to 3.9 yuan. Citibank released US dollars for February at .0625. Hengyu, Fuyu, Tianfeng, Shunli, and Yongli sold aggressively, retreating to 1.5 yuan. Thereafter, the situation stabilized somewhat. Tongfu, Hengyu, Wanxing, and others made small purchases, quickly rising to 3.7 yuan. Yuqing, Yonghan, Hengfu, Xing, Yongda, Decheng, Yuli, Hongxing, Qianchang, Xiangyifeng, Yonghengchang, Yong, and others successively supplied bars, falling to 1.7 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongyuan, and Yicheng made up for their positions at low prices, rising to 2.5 yuan. After hovering, the noon close was 962.2 yuan. The market was flat after the close. The highest price for the morning was 963.9 yuan, and the lowest price was 959.7 yuan, a fluctuation of 4.2 yuan. Ultimately, the market closed down by only 8 jiao from the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was the Central Bank's standard gold bidding price, reduced to 985.5 yuan. According to the closing price, the discount was approximately 23 yuan, 6 yuan less than the previous close. The registered price for February was 955 yuan, and for March, 962 yuan. The replenishment water price for the morning was 945 yuan. The price of red gold was calculated at 962.2 yuan. The spot market situation was stable. As the settlement period neared, both supply and demand were observing. The buying price for Tianjin goods was increased by 2.5 yuan, but there were few transactions. There were rumors that the Central Bank was intervening in the spot market with 280 bars at a price of 955 yuan. However, being in this year-end period, the future is likely to be sluggish. It was difficult to obtain short positions for swaps, because while the foreign interbank lending rate was low, credit was apparently tight. At a price of 7.2 jiao, Dachen and Hengxing were willing to pay out. It was heard that many were also willing to pay out at 7.5 jiao, but it was ultimately difficult to find a counterpart.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. In total, Yongli, Hengxing, Dachen, Dachangxiang, Fuxing, Yongsheng, Dahengxingyuan, Dingkang, Yuanyi, Hengyu, Shengsheng, Yuda, Dachang, Dayuanmao, Yong, etc., were on the buying side. Yifeng, Yongqing, Fayong, Tianfeng, Qianchangxiang, Hengchang, Yongyicheng, Yongdefuyu, Wanxing, Hongxing, Zhengchang, Chunyuan, Yong, etc., were on the selling side. Zhengchang allocated 1,050 bars to Yifengyong at a price of 962 yuan. Chunyuan, Yongfuyu, Dingkang, Dafayong, Yuanyong, and Yicheng exited and then entered. Yongli, Zhaofengchang, Shunlichang, and Dada advanced and then exited. The Dalian group and Wanxing traded a total of over 900 bars, settling over 200 bars. Shunli traded a total of over 300 bars, settling with a slight profit. The Guangdong group and Shengsheng made a slight profit. Hengxing entered over 300 bars, exiting a small number. The total number of transactions for the day was 22,981 bars.</p>
<p>For the February contracts that have not yet been settled, the buyers include Futai, Xiangheng, Hengyu, and Dingkang, each with over 700 contracts; Fuxingyong, with over 300 contracts; Fuchang and Ruikang, each with over 200 contracts; and Qingfayong, Shenkang, Dada, and Juchang, each with over 100 contracts.

<h3 id="e241">Foreign Exchange Market Remains Loose <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Speculators Strive to Purchase US Dollars</p>
<p>Banks' Appetite for Selling Shows No Sign of Weakening</p>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London large bars and New York silver prices remained unchanged. The Montevideo forward silver market also saw no rise or fall. London spot gold rose by half a penny, British currency against US rose by half a point, British currency against French rose by 6 pounds. US currency against British unchanged, US currency against French reduced by half a point. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices: British currency at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 375; US currency at 35. Compared to the previous close, the British and American currencies were both flat. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with the British rising by 125 and the American rising by 3125. The customs gold unit fell by 1.5 fen. After the opening, Chinese merchants felt less confident, and banks continued to sell. HSBC's announcement showed both British and American currencies unchanged, but because banks repeatedly supplied, the process eventually hardened. The announcement of the silver balancing tax being unchanged led to stability. HSBC and Chase Manhattan took advantage of the low prices to settle, and Chinese merchants such as the Guangdong group and Fuchang suddenly had buying interest. Coupled with rumors of Central Bank intervention in the spot market, the process suddenly improved and became slightly tighter. However, because banks continued to sell at high prices, the trend was set. Later, banks traded with each other, and the process was mediocre. The noon close saw recent selling prices: British currency at 1 shilling, 5 pence, 375 and 4375; US currency at 35.4375 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the situation was slightly looser. Chinese merchants bought and sold unevenly, generally purchasing US dollars. The Dalian group also purchased, transferring contracts. Jewish merchant Qiaozhifu also purchased US dollars. With the US Supreme Court about to rule on the gold clause, the general sentiment leaned towards purchasing US dollars and selling foreign exchange. There was demand for British and American foreign exchange for April at 4 yuan, 8 jiao, and 8.5 fen, but no transactions were made. The transactions for the first half of the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>British Currency: The morning opening saw recent selling prices at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 375. Helan sold to Youli and Huayi 25 for February. Great Britain sold to Korea 125 for March. Sassoon sold to Dongya 25 for February. The closing selling price was 1 shilling, 5 pence, 375 and 4375 for January, 1875 and 25 for February, 125 for March, 0625 for April, and 5 pence for May. The buying price was increased by 0625.</p>

<h3 id="e242">Cash Circulation Difficult <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Recently, as the Lunar New Year approaches, most businesses are winding down. Due to the poor economic conditions, circulation and adjustment are quite difficult. As a result, debts are passed on, making it difficult to achieve a satisfactory resolution, leading to a very rigid situation. The financial community is facing this difficult situation and has no way to remedy it. Therefore, there are many who have been affected and suffered losses, and many who have been implicated. Ultimately, many dare not rashly lend, and those in need have no way to raise funds. This can be clearly seen in the interbank lending market. On the surface, foreign interbank lending rates are loose, but that is because there are those who want to lend but no one to borrow from, and those who want to borrow but no one dares to lend to. As a result, there are very few interbank lending transactions. Early morning transactions were only 1.3 to 1.4 million, with new transactions of over 300,000. Afternoon transactions were over 400,000. Transactions among small associations were over 700,000. The foreign interbank lending rate was slightly lower than the previous day, calculated at 8 fen, the same for both morning and afternoon. Adding water to the drawing was also due to the actual surplus of funds, but those who needed funds could not obtain them. Therefore, those with a surplus had more, and those in need remained in need. The foreign mortgage loan transaction took back over 800,000, with new loans of over 900,000. The source of customer funds was 200,000, and the outflow was also 200,000. Over 500,000 in banknotes were recovered, and over 700,000 in circulating notes were issued, along with 400,000 in marked notes. Bank collection and disbursement: Foreign banks collected and disbursed over 2.2 million in bill payments, over 4.89 million in various goods and foreign exchange mortgages and miscellaneous payments, over 1.4 million in foreign exchange settlement payments, over 700,000 in special remittance payments, over 1.4 million in year-end settlement payments, and 600,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks collected and disbursed over 3 million in bill payments, over 6.56 million in various goods and foreign exchange mortgages, tax payments, and miscellaneous payments, over 1.8 million in foreign exchange settlement payments, over 800,000 in special remittance payments, over 2.2 million in year-end settlement payments, and 500,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Japanese banks collected and disbursed over 2.78 million in bill payments, over 4.78 million in various goods and foreign exchange miscellaneous payments, over 1.3 million in special remittance payments, over 2.2 million in year-end settlement payments, over 500,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, and 400,000 in warehouse deposits.

<p>丨Stock Exchange Holiday Announced丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a recovery in prices as the settlement period was only two or three days away. The stable environment bolstered confidence, and short sellers gradually covered their positions and made adjustments. Traders from the Northern faction mostly bought, and those with the 16th series bought especially enthusiastically, gradually causing a short squeeze. However, the squeeze was slow and not aggressive. With the settlement date approaching and only two days remaining after the settlement before a long holiday, including the weekend, totaling seven days, both longs and shorts on the market wanted to settle their positions. Therefore, both adjustments and liquidation transactions were active. The price fluctuations depended only on the imbalance of supply and demand for chips, causing slight ripples. Starting today, only two days remain for trading this month. The majority of both sides will likely engage in a squeeze at some point. Yesterday's trading saw no signs of recovery in the initial auction in the morning. Short sellers gradually covered their positions starting at the 19th series. The current month for the 19th series rose by 3 jiao, while the rest also did well by about 1 jiao. Only the 6th series fell by 3 jiao, causing some unease. The trend in the second round was also chaotic, generally with more rises than falls by 1 or 2 jiao. Traders from the Northern faction with the 11th and 14th series were the most aggressive buyers, and those with the 16th series also covered their shorts. Those with the 4th and 54th series sold slightly. The market seemed to be trending down when it opened in the afternoon, but demand from the Northern faction and the 16th series remained, with prices fluctuating up and down by only 1 or 2 jiao. The closing trend was still a short squeeze. The reorganization rose sharply by 3 or 4 jiao, and the current month for the 20th series also squeezed higher by 4 jiao. The rest also did well by 1 or 2 jiao. The overall price result was continued gains of 1 or 2 jiao to 3 or 4 jiao, with the 20th series current month rising the most, by 7 jiao. The total number of transactions was 18,826,500 yuan. The price fluctuations are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported yesterday (the 22nd) that the New York stock market was dull and uneven. Transactions were generally limited to blue-chip stocks, among which General Electric, Studebaker Automotive, and International Telephone and Telegraph saw more active trading. According to experts, the market may not be able to escape this dull and hovering state before the gold clause is announced. Bond traders expressed disappointment at the Supreme Court's recess, as they could plan new strategies after the ruling. Even if the ruling is unfavorable to the government, bonds are unlikely to fall sharply, but they would rather wait for the announcement of the ruling before determining a course of action. Bond markets were mixed today, and small exchange stocks fell slightly. Full-day trading volume was 590,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3 id="e246">Rumors of Cotton Exports <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>500-600 Bales of Lingbao American Upland Cotton</p>
<p>丨However, All Parties Are Still Denying丨</p>
<p>The cotton market showed a firm and rising trend. Because the US cotton situation did not escape hovering, and Indian cotton suffered heavy frost damage, short sellers were somewhat active in covering their positions. However, some, considering the difficulties of the yarn mills, believed that raw cotton was too expensive compared to yarn prices. In the afternoon market, rumors circulated that the Tongji Cotton Firm sold 500-600 bales of Lingbao cotton, Tianjin American Upland cotton, to the Mei'an Foreign Firm. However, because this matter was of great importance, the reporter conducted a thorough investigation after the close of the market. Some parties were unwilling to admit it. What the truth is remains to be proven by facts.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Zheng Biao and Meiji Shift from Short to Long <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>In the opening auction of contract cotton, the market outlook was slightly weak. Because US and Indian cotton markets both saw small declines, confidence was dimmed. Also, as the year-end closing period drew near, business declined further. However, Meiji shifted from short to long, and Ruidacontinued to resist short positions. As a result, the prices for each month were mixed, fluctuating by 5 fen. The market was very weak when it opened in the afternoon. It was heard that the off-market price of Indian cotton had fallen by about three rupees. However, in the second and third rounds of bidding, news of Chinese cotton exports surfaced in the market. However, because this concerned the cotton market, the reporter inquired with all parties. The Tongji Company sold Lingbao cotton to the American Mei'an Foreign Firm at a price of 56.7 yuan. The price of Tianjin American Upland cotton was 53.25 to 53.5 yuan. The quantity was approximately 500 to 600 bales. However, some said that although this deal had been completed, it was still difficult to determine where the goods would ultimately be shipped. The contract cotton market rose slightly, up 5 fen to 1 jiao. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,700 dan, Changfeng sold 1,700 dan, Dachang sold 1,000 dan, Changyu sold 700 dan, Runkang sold 1,000 dan, Changhe sold 700 dan, and Jifeng sold 700 dan. Meiji bought 3,600 dan, Ruida bought 3,300 dan, Xinhua bought 1,200 dan, Changhe bought 1,300 dan, and Yicheng bought 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>| Contract Cotton | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| January | 36.35 | 36.30 | 36.35 | ... | 56,300 |</p>

<p>Spot cotton consumption felt increasingly sluggish. The mills were taking stock at year end and some were temporarily halting operations, naturally reducing the demand. In some cases, it was a result of lack of credit and funds, making transactions stagnant. Supply came from Yao Cotton at 300 Bales and Tong Cotton at 1030 Bales.</p>

<p>The yarn market remained unchanged. With the Lunar New Year approaching, most people are closing their books. Market transactions are primarily for liquidation purposes, with few new businesses. The spot price remained unchanged throughout the day. However, some short sellers, observing that foreign cotton is doing well, and the yarn mills are struggling, believe that there is a possibility of early shutdowns and delayed restarts.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Golden Rooster Yarn Still Calm <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>In the opening auction of contract yarn, things mostly appeared calm and unchanged. Foreign cotton markets saw US cotton falling 5 fen and Indian cotton falling 2 or 3 rupees, but the market remained weak and lifeless. As a result, January and March both fell 2 jiao and May rose 4 jiao. The afternoon opening was hardly different from the morning market. However, large short sellers covered their positions slightly. This month was mostly stable, resulting in mixed gains and losses for each month, fluctuating by 1 or 2 jiao. It was found that Jinchang sold 850 bales, Changfeng sold 1,050 bales, Runkang sold 250 bales, Yukang sold 300 bales, and Shenchang sold 500 bales. Hexing bought 200 bales, Yuda bought 200 bales, Dafu bought 650 bales, Meiji bought 600 bales, Dafeng bought 650 bales, Xinhua bought 450 bales, and Shenji bought 300 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>The spot yarn sales market remained normal. The total number of bales purchased by various guilds throughout the day was 705. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each guild are as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland 65, Ningbo 25, Guangdong 360, Changsha 115, Xuzhou 5, Jiangxi 5, Shantou 45, Nanjing 15, Yunnan 5</p>

<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The Hankou cotton market is showing a very weak trend. Although factories are offering cotton on the market, purchasing interest is sluggish. Attendees at the market include Yuhua First Factory, Minsheng Factory, Hunan First Factory, and the Japanese-owned Taian Factory, all of whom are present to absorb cotton, but transactions remain sporadic. Most export traders are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, with only Xiong Yunji making purchases. Therefore, sales are particularly slow, with a total of 516 large bales, 846 small-medium bales, 220 small bales, and 297 small lots transacted, equivalent to 3,870 dan and 60 jin in market weights. Market prices are generally stable. The following is a summary of cotton prices from various regions (all prices are per dan in market weights):</p>
<p>Hekou Cotton Price: 35 yuan 3 jiao</p>
<p>Suizhou Cotton Price: 34 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen</p>
<p>Shayang Cotton Price: 34 yuan 6 jiao</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was calm and inactive as everyone awaited the decision on the gold standard proposal. At the opening, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and Mumbai, long positions were liquidated, with declines of 6 to 12 points for various months. Subsequently, due to poor sales and limited deliveries, fluctuations were minimal. The January contract saw a large liquidation due to delivery notices reaching 700 bales, followed by buying from brokers, which stabilized the market. Current demand is weak, and factory interest is subdued. At the close, the spot month fell by 10 points, while other months fell by 5 to 6 points. Spot cotton fell by 5 points. The British cotton market was flat, with limited trading. Spot cotton fell by 3 points, while futures rose by 1 point. Indian cotton initially strengthened due to short covering, but later weakened due to selling by speculative buyers. Pingle fell by 3 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 22nd):</p>

<p>Distant Months Also Seeing Strong Selling Pressure</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market uniformly declined after opening in the morning. Quotations for foreign wheat showed a decline of 2.0 jiao in Chicago and around 2.4 jiao in Canada. At the opening, short positions for the current month, due to the nearing of delivery, were eagerly liquidated. Moreover, as factories still held a significant amount of hedging positions and were unwilling to unwind them, market sentiment weakened. Distant months also declined due to the unfavorable foreign wheat situation and a large number of short positions. The market atmosphere loosened. By the afternoon opening, the situation for the current month deteriorated further. Hedgers had to deliver goods, and with the tight credit conditions, there were fewer new hedgers to take their place, leading to lower prices. Distant months also continued to fall step by step due to strong selling pressure. According to market insiders, if hedgers do not cover their positions for the current month and short positions need to be closed urgently, there may still be problems. As a result, the current month fell by 3.75 fen, February fell by 3.5 fen, March fell by 3 fen, April and May fell by 2.75 fen, and June fell by 1.75 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Distant Month Wheat Slightly Sold Short <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was generally quiet in all months after opening in the morning. Although foreign wheat quotations continued to decline slightly by about 2.4 jiao, there was little movement due to only two trading days left before the settlement date, and outside speculators had already stopped participating. Market insiders had also closed their positions. By the afternoon opening, trading became even more scarce. The February contract was offered at a loss in every transaction, while the March and April contracts saw more short selling, making the market atmosphere unstable. However, the volume was very small, and fluctuations were minimal. As a result, February fell by 4 fen, March fell by 4 fen, and April fell by 1 fen. Spot wheat lacked interest from factories, and traders also feared that settlements would have to wait until the market reopened after the Spring Festival.</p>

<p>(Southern Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various regions increased, totaling over 50 shipments (over 9,000 shi of goods). Sales in the local market were brisk, and bulk purchases continued, such as the Qingdao traders buying 600-700 bags. Therefore, the market improved, and the situation tightened. Thick japonica and late rice varieties saw gains of several jiao. However, with the approaching major settlement period, significant changes seem unlikely. Du Jian rice has been in short supply for several days and is now particularly popular. Foreign Jian rice remains inactive. Yin Bian Yuan rice is still stable.</p>
<p>(Northern Shanghai) Yesterday, over 20 shipments arrived from various regions in the He Xia area. Sales of various types of rice in the market showed slight improvement. White japonica saw some trading, while thin rice sold slightly better. Remaining goods were slow. Market prices saw a slight increase for white japonica, while Bian Yuan and various Jian varieties declined by several fen. Thin rice saw little fluctuation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw sluggish sales of Ke rice. In the general market, only 500 bags of Saigon broken rice were traded. As traders in various regions are closing their books for the year, purchasing interest is gradually fading. However, there were still inquiries in the local market, with a transaction of over 1,000 bags of Saigon first-grade rice and a trade of 800 tons of futures broken rice. The market is temporarily stable. As production prices have been firm for a long time, cargo owners are very confident and are unwilling to sell at low prices despite having a large inventory. The market may stabilize within the year. However, with traders eager to close their books, sales of Ke Xian rice have been slow. Only 700-800 bags were offered on the previous day. Yesterday, cargo owners lowered prices to encourage sales, which resulted in 2,600 bags being offered, but prices were 5 fen to 1 jiao lower than the previous market. The He Xia rice market is scheduled to close on the 28th, so the local market for foreign Ke Xian rice may be lively for now.</p>

<p>Yesterday, trading in the miscellaneous grain market was scarce. The overall situation was that partial closures were already taking place. The soybean market initially weakened due to sluggish sales. In the afternoon, news of sharp gains in distant-month contracts slightly improved sentiment, but trading remained sparse.

<h3 id="e259">Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Further Reduced by 2 Jiao <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a more sluggish trend, with very few transactions. The guild's quotations for Grade 24 coarse white sugar and Dutch red sugar received no bids. The previously arrived Guangdong coarse white sugar continued to be auctioned yesterday. The original amount was 2,460 bags, and the price was reduced by another 2 jiao to 18 yuan 3 jiao. Only 70 bags were transacted, indicating the weakness of the market. Chaoqing sugar continued to be offered at 21-2,300 bags, with little fluctuation. Huanggang Qing sugar was priced at 10 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen, and Longqing Jiang sugar was priced at 9 yuan 8 jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e260">Hunan Lotus Seeds Price Rebound <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds have not had a chance to rebound recently due to the lack of large-scale sales in the Shanghai market. However, according to a letter from Hankou, inventories in the production area have become thin. Despite the approaching major settlement period, sales have been active, leading to a price increase of 7-8 jiao. At the same time, prices in the production area have also increased by 6 jiao. Market sentiment here has also tightened slightly. It is expected that the first trading day after the settlement period will see a recovery.</p>

<h3 id="e261">Enamel Factories Pre-Purchase Futures Black Iron Sheets <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>The black iron sheet market has been very weak recently. Although holders are making every effort to attract buyers, the unfavorable environment has made sales difficult. However, well-capitalized enamel factories, seeing that current prices for these goods are low, have been actively paying deposits to order futures for delivery in the coming spring. 500 bundles of 2-foot 6-inch 18-gauge prime grade sheets were transacted at a price of 9 yuan 5 jiao, and 1,000 bundles of secondary grade sheets were transacted at a price of 8 yuan 5 jiao. 250 bundles of 3-foot 6-gauge to 13-gauge sheets were transacted at a price of 9 yuan 6 jiao. It is said that these transactions were sold by metal shops in the North Suzhou Road area.</p>

<h3 id="e284">Thinking About the Future of the National Products Industry <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Kangsheng</p>
<p>The teacher taught us to read a biography of Edison. From this book, we learn lessons that can be applied to our national products industry in two ways:</p>
<p>First, those with capital should organize consortia to provide the necessary living and experimental expenses for people with inventive genius, enabling them to imitate existing foreign goods and, even further, invent goods that foreign countries do not have. In the process of Edison's invention of the light bulb, all expenses were provided by American consortia. Although more than a year passed without solving the intended objective, the consortia still trusted him. It should be known that only with such good consortia in America could a great inventor like Edison emerge. Inventors are also human beings; if their basic needs for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation cannot be met, how can they concentrate on developing their inventive genius? Moreover, most of our inventors are trapped by financial constraints! Therefore, this is the first thing that should be done.</p>
<p>Second, the number of imitated products is increasing day by day, which is certainly progress in the national products industry; however, the fact tells us that many national products are made entirely of foreign raw materials, which is still somewhat unsatisfactory. When Edison invented the light bulb, the filament he used was obtained after testing 100,000 times on 6,000 kinds of bamboo filaments. The raw material for that bamboo filament came from Japan. Later, after many years of experimentation, he selected materials manufactured domestically to make the filament, abandoning Japanese goods. This is precisely the same work that we must do in the national products industry; otherwise, the more national products made entirely from foreign raw materials increase, the more the trade deficit will never decrease, because even if the people of the whole country buy national products, the national products manufacturers are directly importing foreign goods, so aren't the Chinese people indirectly selling foreign goods? Therefore, technical personnel of national products should try their best to research and discover them, and must not continue to be negligent.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that the realization of these two things is when the national products industry is on the right track. It will certainly lead to more significant progress than setting a National Products Year every year.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Students' Views on National Products in Various Countries <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>The calendar has turned to the first page of the twenty-fourth year, and it is said to be the third National Products Year. Although the import volume of cosmetics during the previous Women's National Products Year was somewhat uncomfortable, we can only say a silly self-deprecating remark, "The past is gone, the future can be pursued," under helpless circumstances—or what else can we do?</p>
<p>The third National Products Year has fallen on the students, who, as usual, have a relatively general level of knowledge, so the results this year may not be too unpleasant.</p>
<p>However, in a small number of cases, although a small number of students may attach a little more importance to foreign goods because they do not lack spending money and have more exposure to Western cultural relics, and they may regard foreign goods as noble and fashionable; however, it cannot be said that these students do not know how to love their country. At most, it is just that they (or she) do not have enough understanding of national products, and their views on the worship of foreign goods are wrong.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the curtain of this brand-new "Students' National Products Year" has just been raised, it may not be impossible to briefly mention the views of students in various countries on national products as a "mountain of assistance from others"?</p>
<p>(1) Japan 丨 To talk about students' views on national products, we must start with Japan. Before the Meiji Restoration, the domestic situation in Japan was as bad as the current situation in China: domestic production was scarce, and people had to obtain all daily necessities from foreign countries; and students (especially university students), because they had read a little Western books, everyone valued foreign goods very much. However, in the fifty or sixty years after the Meiji Restoration, on the one hand, the domestic productive forces have been strengthened, and the quality and quantity of all products have been greatly improved; and at the same time, the national authorities have also used various methods to encourage students to use national products 丨丨丨 For example, I heard that students at the Imperial University had to wear national product uniforms, and no matter how excellent their grades were, they would not be allowed to graduate. And in recent years, although nine out of ten students wear suits, 70-80% of the materials are their own domestic goods. The most surprising thing is the fountain pens they use—no matter how fashionable and noble the Parker and Conklin products from Europe and the United States are, they still honestly use their own "Taisho Mannenhitsu"!</p>
<p>(2) England——England is a country rich in conservatism and tradition, which everyone knows. Until now, the spirit of mercantilism is still quite preserved in their people. The country has always tried to increase exports; and the people, pay special attention to domestic goods. Students are especially so. From the time they are elementary school students, they have received traditional concepts in their families. As soon as they hear that something is "British," they immediately feel a sense of intimacy and glory. Growing up, it becomes an instinct. For daily necessities, from shirts to ties, from ink to tennis rackets, ice skates, cameras and other entertainment supplies, although German products are better than theirs, they still like to use "British" products. Even books and textbooks often have two versions, British and American. The binding and printing of the American version are more exquisite than the British version, but they choose the inferior domestic version to buy.</p>
<p>(3) France丨France is generally called "the country of fashion," The Country of Fashion, but their students' love for domestic goods is deeper than in other countries. The books, stationery, clothing, instruments, and cosmetics used by girls are either from Lyon or Paris. "French goods" are a supreme boast for French students.</p>
<p>(4) Germany丨Germany suffered a great loss in the European War, and the domestic situation was too bad; it was not easy for young people to go to school, and of course, it was impossible to purchase foreign goods. In these ten years of hard work, their students have completely developed a passion for using domestic goods.</p>
<p>The above is just a description of the situation in a few major countries. In the student circles of other countries, such as the United States, Russia, and Italy, they all have a special love for their own domestic goods. In this "Students' National Products Year," if Chinese students like to learn from foreign countries, then they can learn the virtue of their students' love for using national products.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Record of the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Guanjun</p>
<p>At 9 a.m. on January 6th, I was bored at home, so I went to visit the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition. It was a regular holiday on Sunday, so the number of visitors was even more crowded. Now, I will briefly record the highlights of the venue below:</p>
<p>The exhibition hall is located at the entrance of Hengxing Lane on Limatou Road in the 16th Puli of this city. There are two entrances and exits to the venue, both decorated with pine and cypress arches, with a national flag of the Kuomintang and another cloth banner with the words: "Shanghai South National Products Exhibition hosted by the China National Products Manufacturers Association welcomes visitors." There is also a couplet that says: "Promote Chinese National Products," "Work Hard to Save the Country with National Products."</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen factories displaying their products in the venue. The venue is a built-up shed, so it is high and bright. The exhibits are divided into categories such as cotton fabrics, silk fabrics, woolen fabrics, food, hardware, and leather. The best ones are the following three:</p>
<p>(1) The cosmetics of Shanghai Xiangpin Company, including powders, honey, rouge, perfume, essence, and Stancomb used by men and women. It is said that since the opening, female students from large, medium, and small schools in this city have purchased a lot, which shows a good phenomenon in the "Students' National Products Year."</p>
<p>(2) The glassware of the Central Chemical Glass Factory includes household teacups and vases, as well as glass tubes, glass pipes, glass covers, etc., totaling no less than twenty types, which shows a good phenomenon for the future of chemistry in our country.</p>
<p>(3) The educational supplies of Meilingdeng Factory include ink, colors, decolorizing water, advertising colors, economic ink, fountain pen ink, etc. It is said that the color of this ink does not change. The manufacturing method uses electric power to grind, so it is exceptionally fine. I bought a bottle of China Brand ink for only thirteen copper coins, which can be said to be cheap.</p>
<p>Several police officers stood in the venue to prevent petty theft. Outside the venue, there were outposts of the Shanghai South District East District Fire Brigade and the First Team of the Shanghai South District Security Corps to prevent accidents in the venue.</p>
<p>It is said that the exhibition period is only two weeks, but the daily business is over 15,000 yuan, which shows the general public's love for and use of national products. I visited the venue for a week, and there was no shortage of buyers, which shows the results of the public's improvement.</p>
<p>I hope that all students in large, medium, and small schools in the city will use national products during this "Students' National Products Year." First, it will not lose the value of the "Students' National Products Year," and second, it can develop our country's national products. All the talented students in the city should advocate and implement this.</p>
<p>New News from the National Products Industry in One Week</p>
<p>▲The Student National Products Year Promotion Committee will convene its first executive board meeting in the coming days to discuss promotion methods and the establishment of branch associations.</p>
<p>▲Since our country's national products participated in the Chicago World's Fair, they have gained considerable international credibility. Recently, a large South African merchant came to China and contacted the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Company to transport samples. The company has agreed to handle famous and valuable national products and will ship them out soon for exhibition.</p>
<p>▲Zhang Xianglin, Zhou Guanhong, Dong Kunfan, and others, in view of the honor of our national products at the Chicago World's Fair, plan to obtain a market overseas and develop our country's international trade. They have newly planned to establish a large-scale production and sales company in Chicago. It is heard that Mr. Zhang and others will begin to implement this plan upon their return to China, and many leaders in the city's business community have also expressed their support.</p>

<h3 id="e287">Nanyang Market Observation Notes (3) <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>A Conversation with Mr. Kang Yuan丨</p>
<p>(Question) Mr. Xiang, how do you think we should nurture roots and trunks?</p>
<p>(Answer) People in the country often believe that overseas Chinese in Nanyang are wealthy. I believe that people in the country may be even wealthier than overseas Chinese. However, the money of overseas Chinese circulates in the market. If they only have two or three coins, they will do the business of ten coins. Wealthy people in the country like to deposit money in banks, especially foreign banks. They have ten coins, but they are not willing to do the business of one coin. The same money, one dead and one alive, has a significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. In the country, I often hear a slogan: "Welcome overseas Chinese to invest in the motherland and develop industries." I think this is too biased. Overseas Chinese should invest in the motherland, and wealthy people in the country should also transfer capital to Nanyang to support the large and small industries and businesses operated by overseas Chinese. They deposit money in foreign banks, just wanting to rely on a British or American flag for protection. It is better to simply transfer capital to Nanyang and be sheltered by the entire foreign power. Isn't that more secure? This is not a joke. Many places in Nanyang really need Chinese to invest. Large and small industries are currently very depressed.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, Nanyang lacks not only strong capital but also specialized talents. On the one hand, we need investment, and on the other hand, we also hope that excellent talents will go to develop. It is best for talents to follow capital. Once the capital goes, there will be a way for talents to go. In the past, people from Fujian and Guangdong could reach the other side for four or five yuan. Now it costs at least one hundred yuan. Moreover, the local government has set various harsh restrictions, and the landing procedures are very troublesome (especially in the Dutch East Indies). People in the country regard it as a daunting task. People who go abroad feel all kinds of suffering, and now it has become a situation of "those who want to go have no money, and those who have money don't go." It is best to use capital and talent together to seek common development. In short, those who are interested in Nanyang, whether they contribute money or effort, are directly related to the economy of overseas Chinese and indirectly related to the national economy and people's livelihood. This shows its importance. In the future, if overseas Chinese industries and businesses need capital, the country should find ways to provide assistance. If people without money want to develop in Nanyang, everyone should help them and organize immigration. This is exactly the principle of "making the best use of people's talents and making the best use of the land."</p>
<p>(Question) Which commodities are most needed in the Nanyang Islands at present?</p>
<p>(Answer) Cotton textiles, daily necessities, and silk are most widely needed. Although Western goods are available, their value is always higher than Japanese goods. People generally like to be greedy for cheapness, so Japanese goods naturally sell well everywhere. In terms of quality, Japanese goods only focus on form and are not durable. It is a pity that our domestic products are rarely found. Otherwise, comparing goods with goods, they are not inferior to Western goods.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Tender Skin <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Tan</p>
<p>Many leaves in the corner of the wall gradually fade from withered green to burnt yellow, which symbolizes that the harsh winter is extending its power.</p>
<p>These days, Xiao Lan gets up early in the morning and goes to work. She walks on the road where the north wind is biting. She hides her hands in her pockets, but her tender skin is a little stinging from the cold wind. She is very annoyed! She is afraid that her skin will slowly freeze and crack, which is not very unsightly! She is not willing to learn from those rich ladies who spend a lot of money to buy imported beauty products. She thinks: "In this year of advocating domestic products for women, women are shamelessly buying foreign goods. Isn't that very shameful?" Therefore, although she has heard that "foreign honey" can protect the skin, she disdains to use it because it is a foreign product. She tried using domestic honey, but found it too sticky. This skin care problem really stumped her!</p>
<p>One day, Xiao Lan saw her girlfriend at her girlfriend's house pouring some white liquid from a flat glass bottle onto her face after washing her face.</p>
<p>"Why don't you have patriotism and want to use that kind of foreign honey?" Xiao Lan said with a reproachful tone.</p>
<p>"This is not foreign honey. This is domestic Xingqiu brand skin cream!" Her girlfriend said while handing over the flat bottle.</p>
<p>She took it in her hand and saw that there were indeed the words "Created by Wuzhou Pharmacy"; at the same time, she also learned that this domestic pure honey not only has good quality but also a lower price.</p>
<p>That day, Xiao Lan went to buy this domestic skin cream. From then on, she no longer feared the cold wind's invasion when walking on the road in the harsh winter.</p>

<h3 id="e289">Little Western Paradise <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8 A Remote Place with a Light Official, a Strong-Willed Order Arrives; a Grand Banquet in a Splendid Hall, Outside There is a Pitiable Worm</p>
<p>Just this sentence of his, outside the house, someone laughed loudly and said: I also agree! Good idea, good idea! That person also spoke with a Zhejiang accent and laughed as he entered. Zhang Jiefu thought, how could this person be so presumptuous? Looking at him, he was a man in his thirties, with a shaved head, a red face, and big eyes. He was wearing a blue wrinkled silk jacket and had rolled up his sleeves, revealing two thick arms, which gave him a bit of a sturdy appearance. Zhiqian smiled and offered him a seat and introduced him to both sides, saying that he was Magistrate Zhou. He laughed: What Magistrate Zhou, just Zhou Congda. Zhang Jiefu said: Your name is You Rong. He laughed: How does Mr. Zhang know? Jiefu said: I saw in the local newspaper that there is a Magistrate Zhou You Rong who has a good reputation for his administration, and he has asked for leave to come to Xi'an and is also staying at Little Western Paradise, so I guessed that. Zhou You Rong looked at Zhiqian and smiled slightly: I am worth something after all. People die leaving a name, and leopards die leaving their skin. I have earned a reputation for good administration. Haha! Actually, I don't have a good reputation for administration, I am disgracing myself, I was beaten up. I slept for two weeks after being beaten, and I couldn't do it anymore, so I took the opportunity to ask for leave and escaped to Xi'an. Zhang Jiefu was shocked when he heard this and asked: I forgot which county in the newspaper the Zhou Magistrate was in. Are the people in this county so fierce? Zhou You Rong laughed: If the common people beat me, what can I say? It must be that I am not doing my job well. Cheng Zhiqian laughed: Mr. Zhang, don't misunderstand. Three or four years ago, the county administration in the northwest counties was indeed difficult to handle. In the past two years, Shaanxi's politics has finally gotten on track. The counties in Guanzhong, in particular, are very orderly. It's just that on the extreme southern or northern borders, transportation is inconvenient. Official documents from Xi'an take two months to go back and forth. If there are old defense forces in that area and the finances are not circulating smoothly, there will be some constraints. Magistrate Zhou's county is located at the junction of three counties. The military leader there has been in office for the past five or six years, so he is not easy to deal with. (120)</p>
<h3 id="e290">Winter Weather Feels Like Spring <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Isn't it already winter now? Hey! Then how does it feel like a mild spring? Could it be that the saying "If Heaven does not change, the Dao does not change" is really a bit wrong now? You! Don't you see the heavy fog covering us every morning? When we get up in the morning, it's not easy to see the person coming across from us. In the past, people said, "Three mornings of fog bring west wind," but unexpectedly, there is fog all the time, and the west wind refuses to blow. For a few days, it was like daytime darkness, with dense layers of clouds like they were about to press down, thinking that "Heaven was making snow up there," and soon it would snow heavily, turning into a silver world. Who knew that the morning light was clear, and a round of rising sun was shining in the eastern sky. The temperature not only did not drop but instead rose, it was as if spring had already arrived, and we were enjoying the warmth of the Qingming Festival. You think, isn't it strange!</p>
<p>What is most surprising is when you go to the suburbs and look around, the wheat in the fields is green and swaying in the wind, like green waves gently rippling. The wheat ears are just starting to sprout, and the broad beans are also developing especially well, with stems as tall as a foot, and the butterfly-shaped flower buds also seem to be flying, releasing a beautiful appearance. If you say it's not spring, where would you get this kind of scenery! Not only that, but sometimes you can also see the traces of flies and ants, they haven't disappeared yet. It's simply not winter, it's turned into spring. Some people say: This is God's kindness. Last year in the summer and autumn, it was hot and dry, and the common people suffered so much. They barely survived until today and haven't starved to death completely, and they can't withstand the great cold. So Heaven also had compassion and canceled this winter, advancing the spring weather ahead of schedule. I say that's right, but even if you have food and clothing, and you're burning a stove and wearing heavy furs, you must not be careless about health preservation.</p>

<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>The comfort of travelers is hidden in the hands of those in green uniforms. The world's tombs can never bury human troubles.</p>
<p>People only know that marriage is the tomb of love, but they don't realize that graduation is the foundation of youth unemployment.</p>
<p>The world's disturbances and the darkness of society cause most people to feel a great deal of fear about the future, but I don't think so. The events of the future will always come, "Don't cry, don't laugh, deepen your understanding." We should embrace this attitude to welcome the future.</p>
<h3 id="e292">Seen on the Public Bus <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Zhenyang</p>
<p>Today I went to Jing'an Temple for business. When I stepped onto the No. 7 public bus, I saw a handsome friend dressed in a Western suit and leather shoes sitting in the carriage. He arrogantly shifted his gaze to the outside of the window, resting his left leg on his right knee and constantly shaking it.</p>
<p>Before long, the bus started moving. After a while, it had already left Xujiahui and sped west. As usual, we all bought a ticket. Naturally, that Western-dressed friend was no exception. However, just as he was buying the ticket, a gust of wind blew, carrying the ticket he had bought out the window. He couldn't help but be stunned, but he still pretended to be indifferent and sat there. At this time, the ticket seller had already seen it and politely asked the Western-dressed friend to buy another ticket. However, not only did the Western-dressed friend refuse to buy another ticket, but he scolded the ticket seller. The ticket seller saw that he was very stubborn, so he softened.</p>
<p>Soon, a ticket inspector came along. He checked this friend and saw that he didn't have a ticket, so he asked him in a foreign language whether he had bought a ticket. But this friend had never studied foreign books, so he didn't understand at all and stood there dumbfounded in front of the foreigner, not even daring to take a breath.</p>
<p>At this time, the ticket seller had the upper hand and took the opportunity to show off his power, scolding the high-spirited Western-dressed young man until he didn't know whether to laugh or cry, even calling him a barber.</p>
<p>I sat next to him, watching the handsome friend with great surprise. Why didn't he even have the courage to speak in front of the foreigner! I was about to stand up and defend him, but he very quickly took out the money for another ticket from his pocket and paid it to the foreigner timidly. So I didn't say any more, only feeling that this Western-dressed friend had completely humiliated us Chinese people.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the terminal station arrived, and he quickly squeezed out of the crowd. When I got off the bus, he was already gone.</p>

<p>— Originally Written by Princess Qing Deling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>They bowed again and accepted the order. Standing side by side in front of the throne, they took out the almanacs and writing materials they had brought with them and began to calculate very solemnly. The Empress Dowager also sat upright and waited patiently for their reply. I happened to be standing behind the Empress Dowager at the time, witnessing them doing this futile and time-wasting thing. I couldn't help but laugh secretly, and I was also very anxious, fearing that they would calculate a bad result. Because I admired the scenery of Changbai Mountain and Songhua River even more than the Empress Dowager, and I had long wanted to visit, but I had no chance. This time I had arrived in Fengtian, and I happened to be with the Empress Dowager, so I was particularly excited to go, but I was afraid that these two old gentlemen from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau would make trouble for us! What particularly fascinated me was a passage recorded in a certain unofficial history, which described the birth history of our ancestors as absurd and beautiful as a myth. It said:</p>
<p>"Before the dates that can be checked in history, there was a small stream with clear water flowing in the wilderness near Changbai Mountain, and the fine and dense ripples were as beautiful as the scales on silver fish when illuminated by the sun. One early summer morning, the weather was particularly hot, and a girl from a family near the stream, known for her beauty, jumped into the stream to swim alone. As she was floating, she suddenly saw a bright red and lovely cherry floating on the green water. She found it interesting and quickly went over and picked it up and swallowed it in one bite. This was a very ordinary thing, and she didn't pay attention to it at all. Unexpectedly, after a few months, her belly gradually grew bigger, and people laughed at her for being pregnant without being married and discussed it. Only her parents knew that her behavior was usually very upright and didn't believe that she really had any shameful affair. But she was indeed pregnant, and eventually gave birth to a very fat boy. This boy was the ancestor of all Manchus...!" (230)</p>
<h3 id="e294">Begging Stick <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Wubian</p>
<p>I read in this newspaper the stories of the "Golden Carrying Pole" written by two gentlemen, which is indeed excellent after-dinner conversation material. Now the reporter will also write a good story about the "Begging Stick." Although it doesn't have much meaning, in these years when extravagance is prevalent, it may help the frugality movement and not violate the principle of showing frugality in national luxury.</p>
<p>This begging stick is still talked about in Huanan and Fengnan counties because the master of this story grew up in one of these two counties, although he has already passed away. What is the story? The master of the begging stick, because his family was destitute when he was young, and his parents both died, and he was young and had no ability to make a living, was forced by life to take a stick, carry a basket, and go out to beg. As the saying goes, "Begging for three years, lazy to be an official," not to mention that he had not received an education and had not learned a profession. Since he had embarked on this path of begging, he naturally made begging his proper profession. However, because he had endured hunger, cold, and hardship, he tried his best to economize in this begging process and did not spend half a cent lightly. In this way, little by little, he accumulated a lot of money after begging for decades. He used this money to buy land and cultivate it. Because of his frugal attitude in everything, he accumulated more and more, and almost became a well-to-do family. Then he built a house, married a wife, had children, and grandchildren. He transformed from a beggar into a wealthy elder. His family motto at that time was naturally no more than the four words "diligence and frugality." Moreover, he solemnly placed his begging stick in the main hall to show that he did not forget his roots and to use it as a warning for his descendants. Later, whenever his descendants disobeyed the family motto and wasted money for no reason, he would use this begging stick to warn and punish them. The descendants, thinking about the difficulty of starting a business, would repent.</p>
<p>After the master of the begging stick died, his grandsons gradually multiplied, forming a large clan. But they still kept the begging stick high, and whenever clansmen were unworthy, they would still use the begging stick to warn and punish them. So this begging stick still holds the highest authority in this clan.</p>

<h3 id="e295">Talking About the Philippine Carnival <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Wenchun sent from the Philippine Islands</p>
<p>A few days ago, various Chinese newspapers announced that the Consul-General's Office had received a telegram from the Mayor of Shanghai, saying that Shanghai Chinese businessmen were enthusiastically preparing to participate in this year's Manila Carnival, and asked the Consul-General to help with everything, with the purpose of seeking Sino-Philippine friendship. The reporter asks to extract the nature and content of the conference so that our business community can have a little knowledge of what to follow.</p>
<p>The English word for Carnival is Carnival, which is the European and American Saint's Day Festival. After the Americans entered the Philippines, they began to hold it. It is purely a shareholder business, and the government is in a promoting and assisting position. There is a difference between old and new shareholders in each session. New shares pay a share of twenty yuan, which is given a beautiful badge, exempt from purchasing tickets, and can enter the auditorium for eight nights to watch various performances and dances. They have the right to vote for the Carnival Queen twice. Old shares pay only half the fee. In addition to being exempt from purchasing tickets, the rights enjoyed are also halved. As for the stock dividend, it disappears when the conference closes. Therefore, the income of the conference mainly comes from ticket stock payments, land rental fees (the area is divided and rented to private individuals for display or circus performances), and advertising fees (advertisements are painted on the surrounding walls).</p>
<p>The election of the Chinese Queen is also called Miss Philippines. In the initial election, newspaper readers have one vote per day for one month. Each registered newspaper can nominate a candidate, or they can freely print tickets for competitors to purchase more by paying a fee. Therefore, in the initial election, each newspaper can get more ticket sales. After the initial election is completed, the images of those elected are hung outside the office by the association for people to admire. A dance party is scheduled for the initial election winners and shareholders (non-shareholders can also purchase tickets to participate). Then the re-election begins. The right to re-elect is in the hands of the shareholders. Ladies from prominent families, wanting to inherit the vanity of this sixteen-night crown, instruct their relatives and friends to campaign for them. Sometimes the campaign is so intense that they cannot be elected without more than ten thousand shares. Therefore, begging for money is a common occurrence. Five years ago, the re-election system was changed, and a panel of judges was organized for aesthetic observation. All initial election winners had to wear swimwear and listen to male judges observing them closely. The Catholic Church strongly opposed this, and the number of shareholders suddenly decreased, so the old system was restored.</p>
<p>The structure of the venue is made of miscellaneous wood pillars, woven bamboo walls, painted in color, and installed with electric lights. Therefore, the lights are brilliant at night, and the layout of the ballroom is even more magnificent and gorgeous. The exhibits in the conference can be divided into three parts: (1) Public exhibits, that is, local products from various provinces and achievements from various agencies, such as schools and prisons, and forms from various departments and bureaus. (2) Merchant exhibits. (3) Various games, such as circuses, comedies, magic tricks, sleds, etc., all require the purchase of separate tickets. (4) Restaurants, pubs, and miscellaneous goods vendors. Four or five years ago, large quantities of domestic goods were transported from Tianjin, Shanghai, Fujian, and Guangdong for display. The National Government sent Vice Minister Mu Ouchu to the Philippines to participate in the grand event, and there was almost no day without welcome banquets. The heat of Sino-Philippine friendship naturally increased a bit as a result. Currently, the country is in great difficulty, and foreign aggression is urgent. Japan is eyeing East Asia, and the key players on the Philippine political stage all value the three islands of Japan. Japanese-Philippine friendship is sincerely hoped for, while Sino-Philippine friendship is a perfunctory formality. For example, this year's Far Eastern Games, which were supposed to be held in the Philippines, were succumbed to by Japan. The dissolution of the Far Eastern Games, which had a history of more than 20 years, is a rehash of old events and an international disgrace. From now on, we can only rely on national diplomacy to promote Sino-Philippine friendship, which may reduce the proposals in the parliament that treat overseas Chinese harshly. This is what our South Overseas Chinese sincerely pray for.</p>
<p>Participating in the exhibition can also find a way out for domestic goods, focusing on daily necessities. Cotton textiles from the Sanyou Industrial Society, canned goods from Shanghai Taifeng and Xiamen Taohua Datong, etc., are all suitable for Philippine consumption. If it is Fuzhou lacquerware, Jiangxi porcelain, antique bronze ware, and wood carvings, they are only for visitors to admire because they belong to decorations and have limited consumption. Among silk fabrics, scenery and figures that can be embedded in mirror frames are cheap and beautiful and also meet the need. In thatched cottages, almost every family hangs landscape paintings, so those seeking products should know what to pay attention to.</p>
<p>The conference is not only an entertainment institution for ordinary people, but because visitors gather in large numbers, the market can prosper. Moreover, if the political community wants to promote any cause, they can use this conference to promote it, which is easy to be effective. For example, eggs here originally came from China and Japan, with an annual leakage of more than 1.7 million pesos. The government wants to encourage the people to raise chickens, not only through written and pictorial propaganda but also by displaying chickens of various colors, and the hatching and feeding methods are arranged according to their progress. In addition, various chicken coops of different sizes are built, and courtyards in front of and behind houses can be developed into small-scale family chicken farms. The audience sees and hears, and in less than three years, chicken raising in various villages has become very effective. The import volume last year has been reduced by one-third.</p>

<h3 id="e296">Concerning the Question of the Interpenetration of Natural Science and Literature <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Jia</p>
<p>Mr. Xiangshan, in his article "The Question of Mutual Interpenetration of Literature and Science,"</p>
<p>believes that the issue of interpenetration between natural science and literature is a matter of handling the subject matter, not a matter of method. Starting from this argument, Mr. Xiangshan proposes his "scientific literature that uses literary forms with natural science as the subject matter" and scientific fantasy novels. He regards this kind of scientific literature and scientific novels as the entire posture of the problem of the penetration of natural science and literature, and rejects the methodological problem of using natural science as an element of literary method.</p>
<p>I believe that Gao Erji's advocacy of "literary masters should assist practical scientific masters to express scientific thoughts, theories, and work in a simple and easy form" is only a tool for the popularization of science in the transitional period. As for whether this kind of scientific literature that uses literary forms to express natural scientific theories will still be necessary in the highest form of society in the future remains a question.</p>
<p>If we savor Mr. Xiangshan's opinions from another perspective, we find that they are inevitably narrow and mechanical. Because the issue of mutual interpenetration between literature and natural science is not only a matter of handling the subject matter but also a matter of method.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiangshan said: "As for those who advocate using natural scientific methods to deal with literature, description, and creation (?), analyzing psychology, heredity, etc., to achieve success, I disagree. If so, then Freud's psychological analysis should become the best method in literature, but the opposite is true. Our progressive method is based on social science."</p>
<p>This passage seems very thorough at first glance, but it is not so in practice. The statement that the progressive literary method is based on social science is only appropriate when it comes to the issue of a realistic and correct understanding. However, merely a realistic and correct understanding and the accumulation of common sense in social science cannot make literature. The main point is still the expression of images. My saying that the issue of mutual penetration between literature and natural science is a matter of method does not mean, as Mr. Xiangshan said, using natural scientific methods to deal with literature – if that were the case, then Mr. Xiangshan would certainly disagree. Mr. Xiangshan's opinion is somewhat based on the distortion or misunderstanding of this "methodological problem." My saying "also a matter of method" precisely means taking the subtle description of psychological or physiological changes, which have been further deepened and corrected due to natural science (psychology, physiology, biology, eugenics, genetics, etc.), as a comprehensive form, as an element of rich and colorful literary techniques. To attribute everything to physiology (sexuality...), psychology, heredity, etc., is the beginning of Freudianism and psychologism, which is certainly wrong.</p>
<p>Relying solely on the analysis of social scientific theories to obtain abstract concepts of social groups, characters, etc., cannot, in an artistic sense, become typical characters with distinct personalities. In China, as in Japan, the subjective depiction of conceptual ideas that simply expresses the analytical results of social scientific theories in literary form is the main shortcoming of early works of new literature. What we want to depict are living characters as cells of the real society. The lives of these living characters contain living joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, humor, love, hate, and other emotions, which intertwine and penetrate each other to form various typical personalities. Therefore, in a comprehensive form, the subtle description of the personality and psychological characteristics of various different characters is essential; without it, typification is impossible. Here, both social science and natural science play a role in the understanding of the class characteristics of the characters. We can never deny the influence of physiology and psychology on naturalistic writers such as Zola, nor can we deny the influence of medicine on the works of realist impressionist writer Chekhov. This influence can be clearly seen in the depiction of the pathological characteristics of characters, in the psychological description of the madman Ivan in "Ward No. 6," and in the description of the protagonist's neurosis in "The Black Monk."</p>
<p>However, what we cannot ignore in this regard is that the role of psychology in the realistic understanding and description of characters' psychology is only as a kind of guidance, just like social science in realistic understanding. As for the fact that the description of characters' personalities, psychology, consciousness, etc., cannot be separated from social conditions, it goes without saying.</p>
<h3 id="e297">Wu Family Restaurant <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Fuxi</p>
<p>In Xuzhen, as long as you mention Wu Family Restaurant, everyone knows it: this is an old restaurant that opened before the Taiping Rebellion at the foot of Wolong Bridge.</p>
<p>"Wu Family Restaurant"</p>
<p>This large cloth signboard can be seen when you run down Wolong Bridge. Two wide frontages, with a second floor, very spacious. This old shop has maintained its reputation from before the Taiping Rebellion to the present, and no other restaurant has been able to compete with it. Because of this old signboard, there has never been a year of loss in the year-end settlement. In these years when all kinds of shops are opening, the business of Wu Family Restaurant is always so prosperous that there is not a single empty table in the dining hall at night.</p>
<p>Those who are mindful in business cannot help but covet the money that Wu Family Restaurant earns every year. Small restaurants in the same industry often cannot compete with Wu Family Restaurant due to their short capital. It seems that Wu Family Restaurant has become the only restaurant in Xuzhen. With Wu Family Restaurant, it seems that there cannot be a second restaurant. Not to mention anything else, whether they are residents of this town or travelers from afar, if they have a banquet, they must go to Wu Family Restaurant. It seems that inviting guests to Wu Family Restaurant is a very honorable thing. No matter how expensive the dishes are at Wu Family Restaurant, or how unremarkable the cooking is, they don't care. Xuzhen is densely populated and has a hub of vehicles and boats. It is also a large town in Jiangnan, but apart from Wu Family Restaurant, there is indeed no second decent restaurant. It is also strange that under the prestige of Wu Family Restaurant, no large restaurants have ever appeared, so the business of Wu Family Restaurant can almost be regarded as monopolized.</p>
<p>Wu Family Restaurant has always maintained its reputation.</p>
<p>But this year, several out-of-town merchants gathered a large amount of capital and planned to open another large restaurant in the town. The decoration of the shop and the equipment were all imitating Wu Family Restaurant. In terms of cooking, they specially processed it, setting prices with restraint. They were preparing to compete with Wu Family Restaurant, so they named the shop "Hu Family Restaurant."</p>
<p>As soon as Hu Family Restaurant opened, the business was unexpectedly good. This phenomenon not only surprised the owner of Wu Family Restaurant, but also surprised the people in the town. Hu Family Restaurant has been open for half a year, and people are saying:</p>
<p>"Wu Family Restaurant is finished. The former Wu Family Restaurant has become the current Hu Family Restaurant..."</p>
<p>Strange, Hu Family Restaurant is like a large magnet, attracting many customers. The old customers of Wu Family Restaurant in the past are like fallen leaves in a storm, blown to Hu Family Restaurant one by one. In this way, the century-old signboard of Wu Family Restaurant has lost its former reputation in the sharpened business competition.</p>
<p>The business of Wu Family Restaurant became quieter day by day...</p>
<p>The shop owner sat at the counter, smoking his cigarette, with nothing to do. Before, sitting at the counter, opening bills, managing money, and writing accounts, he was so busy that he didn't even have time to eat dinner for a few days. The six waiters hired in the dining hall were constantly walking back and forth, busy shouting for their parents. The two cooks, after cooking this dish, immediately cooked that one, only feeling that they couldn't keep up. But now, only two waiters are hired, but they are still idle.</p>
<p>"We must compete with Hu Family Restaurant!"</p>
<p>The owner of Wu Family Restaurant decided to compete with Hu Family Restaurant, so he posted advertisements everywhere, saying that from a certain date to a certain date, there would be a cheap sale for two weeks. After the advertisement was posted, the business did improve, and many old customers who had not traded for a long time also came. The owner felt happy, willing to sacrifice the capital to compete with Hu Family Restaurant. But after the two weeks of cheap sales passed, the business immediately returned to quiet, and, next to the advertisement of Wu Family Restaurant, the new advertisement of Hu Family Restaurant was clearly discovered, which read:</p>
<p>"Big cheap sale for a month!"</p>
<p>So the business of Hu Family Restaurant, following the victory of the competition, became more and more prosperous day by day. …</p>
<h3 id="e298">Banian Port <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Shuang'er</p>
<p>The newly established Banian Port, like a child playing with soap bubbles during the rubber price boom, was blown up and showed brilliant colors; but when the rubber price fell, it shrunk tightly, like a soap bubble suddenly bursting in the air.</p>
<p>At the center of the confluence of the Banian River and the Mira River, some scattered small houses with white walls and red tiles can be seen floating in the dense green forest from a distance, like a relief painting. Its two arms stretched out are the dark green forests, which look like a beautiful scene in the river. As the boat approached the shore of Banian Port, a red building of the oil company and a recessed small dock were revealed in the long Dutch imperial typeface, followed by a long plank bridge extending into the river, and some shop toilets arranged on the riverbed in the posture of police sentry boxes. On the rising tide, yellow feces mixed with tree stumps and leaves floated on the water, while Malay boatmen squeezed between steamers and small steamboats, swaying on the rapid tide.</p>
<p>Landing from a solid plank bridge in front of the customs, passing in front of the county government office, the post and telegraph office, the colonial barracks, and the local prison, Banian Port stretches out with a long road. Behind this lively street, several roads lead to quiet and charming places where white, Chinese, and Malay people's homes are built. No cars were seen, but bicycles rolled quickly under the feet of vigorous Malay people and lively Chinese youths. An unusual silence enveloped the location of this county government. (When I first entered this day from the turbid Singapore, I doubted my ears and eyes; but I finally accepted the feeling given to me by this new world with a sweet mood.) Only at the two ends of this street, the students of the Dutch and Chinese schools recited their books loudly, spreading out with the air current, like playing a subtle melody for this silent universe.</p>
<p>"Ten years ago, the Chinese merchants and wealthy Malay masters in this place used to fill their sacks with banknotes. From the distant forests, Chinese merchants, relying on bare feet swollen with water, squeezed rubber to this estuary to 'load' onto ships, and would fill bags full of gold. — Now, it is not easy to find a fifty-guilder bill." Captain told me when I landed, and shook his head sighing.</p>
<p>A Xing抢着接下去: "At that time, the shop assistants and coolies drank brandy every day, gambled mahjong for fifty guilders, and bought a pound of pork worth eight corners: now, —— the ghosts kill them·—— they can't afford to gamble mahjong for a guilder, and the butcher refuses to kill an extra pig. —— Be careful, they only eat beef once a week, and soon they won't be able to afford vegetables." After saying that, he lowered his head, dreaming of his old golden dreams.</p>
<p>The prosperity of Banian has really become a thing of the past, or in the future, will mankind create another prosperous face for this place! What remains now on this gray pier, and what weighs on the hearts of the poor people, is only a ruthless Dutch county magistrate and his secretary, a fierce-looking Dutch soldier" and his Javanese soldiers, a diligent government tax collector, and a puppet Banian King, as well as a Captain who started with five hundred yuan of capital, doing the work of maintaining the wreckage!</p>
<p>This is: four white people, one yellow people, and one brown race, are jointly building everything in the current Banian Port.</p>
<h3 id="e299">Leaving Puzhuang <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>By chance, I came to teach in such a small town for three months; the semester is over, and I will leave in a hurry, just as I came in a hurry.</p>
<p>There are no bizarre feelings to say about the short three-month town life. There, I discovered a deeper loneliness and desolation of life, and at the same time, I saw the poverty of the countryside and the panic and embarrassment of the residents in the face of the lake bandits' shooting; but who should pay attention to the voices of those farmers complaining about the age?</p>
<p>Although in the twilight, I often had the opportunity to enjoy another kind of consumption. My neighbor's residence was the home of the owner of a large rice shop. In the evening, they always opened their chatterbox, and God gave me a little chance to enjoy myself, listening to Mei Lanfang's signature plays and the peach blossom river song with trembling and nauseating voices through the wall. At the same time, young daughters were echoing and singing, with laughter permeating the songs; in this realm, it makes you meditate on the faint red happy life unfolding in the rice.</p>
<p>On a drizzly and gloomy day, walking to the river bank, listening to the women on the small boats from Jiangbei doing small business, crying for lack of rice to cook.</p>
<p>After sunset, there are often travelers dragging their faltering steps and carrying packages on the riverbank on their way to night.</p>
<p>In front of some small shops, there are villagers with earthy faces talking about the lake bandits' snipers.</p>
<p>During my three-month stay in Puzhuang, my only observations were these few things; for the sake of life, I will leave this small town in a hurry. For the school and several kind friends, before leaving, I can't help but have a little nostalgia; but I will finally leave them silently, and in the vast world, I will embark on a long journey.</p>
<p>After leaving Puzhuang, I will soon pack my bags to go to Wan, and the harsh winter will slip past in my hurried journey! Soon it will be early spring; my only hope is to hear from my friends in the South! At that time, please send me the spring news from Jiangnan.</p>
<h3 id="e300">The Human World (8) <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>After this idea was aroused, all my energy escaped from the situation of the opium couch in the west room and the inquiry about business conditions. I wanted to try to inquire a little about her personal life.</p>
<p>Indeed, she can be said to be a bitter person. She told me about her difficult and bad experiences. I also knew that her mother was not only not her biological mother, but also not her stepmother.</p>
<p>Her age, like what I judged her to be, was seventeen years old. She was from Xin Dian, a village downstream of Harbin. Her family originally grew crops. During the great flood of the Songhua River in July 1932, her home was washed away, and she was washed to Harbin. The person who led her here was her cousin. She repeatedly said that she would find a way to save her cousin from her predicament, and she also believed that her cousin was her only relative. Unexpectedly, this great person coveted sixty Harbin dollars, forgot her affection, and sent her to this place, and also found this young mother for her. She changed her clothes, cut her braids, and became a fashionable girl in the city. Life went on like this. However, she could not help but often miss her old hometown and her biological parents and brothers. Especially when a violent and incomparable guest mercilessly ravaged her body, it made her recall the past. The abyss of sin-filled city was gradually swallowing her weak girl.</p>
<p>She had no concept of the country, nor did she want to struggle for life. She only wished to die early and end her wishes. She did not blame heaven and did not blame the earth. She only blamed her bad fate, and the flood was precisely the life-threatening ghost who drove her to hell and into the grave.</p>
<p>When I told her that the flood was caused by the XX people, who deliberately dug the dikes to drown the anti-Japanese volunteers in the downstream area, the tension in her situation and the degree of her resentment were simply indescribable to me. I can say that she was a hundred times more nervous than when she fled the flood. She kept angrily shouting:</p>
<p>"Is that so? Is that so? Is that how it is! Is that how it is!"</p>
<p>Her hands were clenched tightly, and she looked like she was going to find the XX people to fight.</p>
<p>Really, how many people know that the flood was caused by the XX people? If it weren't for a person who dug the dikes with his own hands, he told me, how could I not think it was a natural disaster!</p>
<p>A burst of laughter came from the west room, probably because my friend had displayed his "male" power. I heard him shouting loudly:</p>
<p>"No way! You have to have a kiss!"</p>
<p>Why ask her for a kiss! I was just thinking this when there was no movement in the west room. Suddenly, Xiao Ju stretched out her hands and tightly held my hands, her body trembling as if she was cold, like a begging little bird. I looked at her for a while and saw that she had been attacked by some kind of terror. A moment ago, she was still telling me about her life. I also forgot that this situation was a little embarrassing for me, and my face didn't turn red. I was just thinking, who is she afraid of? It stands to reason that there are no strangers in this hut except me, so why is she afraid of me? That's not right, if she was afraid of me, she wouldn't be close to me. I was wrong to think of her that way.</p>

<h3 id="e301">Translation Year and Creation Year <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Lv</p>
<p>I read an article by someone in the New Year's issue of "Literature," saying "I wish this year to be the year of translation following the year of magazines."</p>
<p>I think; before China has produced greater works, hoping this year to be a "year of creation" is more meaningful in every aspect than a "year of translation."</p>
<p>The difficulty of cultivating translation talents is more than ten times that of creation talents; the separation of languages of various countries, the inability to use them skillfully and instinctively, is of course an obstacle; however, the biggest reason is not here. It must be known that the task of translating literary works is not only to turn foreign languages into formal native languages. What is more important is to explore the depths of the original author's soul with one's own cultivation, grasp the formation of his thoughts when writing, and then purify it into my writing; only then can it become a true translation. In this kind of translation, the original author and the translator have merged into one.</p>
<p>How different are the worldviews of each person? Using individual and different cognition to translate the same work, even if you get "sweating profusely," the true breath does not exist. What remains is nothing more than some corpse-filled resurrected corpses. As for those who do not understand the meaning of the full text and borrow a dictionary to translate sentence by sentence, it goes without saying!</p>
<p>It is not without reason that there are few complete translations on the market.</p>
<p>The poverty of the Chinese literary world is not limited to translation; creation is not so! Instead of doing "thankless" translation work, why not work a little harder on creation in the near future? Perhaps the harvest of creation is more and more valuable than translation.</p>
<p>Efforts in creation have two meanings:</p>
<p>1. Effort in quality: A Cultivate a sound worldview. (Authenticity of the work.) (Content conditions.) B Develop fresh themes. C Use mature techniques. (Expressiveness of the work.) (Formal conditions.)</p>
<p>2. Effort in quantity: A Eliminate the Yuan Zhonglang school, the Public Security school, the Jingling school, the antique writing, and all kinds of non-donkey and non-horse miscellaneous essays. (Passive work) B Promote new talents and encourage the production of long works.</p>
<p>I hope that the year of creation, which is not just an empty shout, will come.</p>

<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>"Young master, the train is broken!"</p>
<p>I was jolted awake from my sleep by the shouting: It was Li Ma. Her small feet seemed hardly able to support her obese body as she swayed unsteadily in front of my mosquito net. Her voice sounded as if it were muffled by something, turning into a rough, guttural sound. Seeing that I was awake and just looking at her, she shouted:</p>
<p>"Young master, the train has been roaring all night, didn't you hear it? The city is completely overrun with 'ash worms' [soldiers]; they grab people when they see them. A'yun was almost dragged away when she went to buy vegetables; she lost her vegetable basket and scale. At the small bridgehead, the Gui Sheng family had their door pried open by 'ash worms,' and the father and son were so scared that they jumped into the back river and fled. Now, they're loitering in front of our door. A'yun has piled up the stone mortar and millstone to block the door..." She raised her fat palm in a gesture, "Young master, I want to go home, I'll be dragged away by the 'ash worms' and made into cannon fodder!"</p>
<p>Before I could answer, she stomped heavily down the stairs.</p>
<p>According to the newspapers these past few days, our county town, due to its railway connections, would sooner or later be drawn into the war front. The increased train traffic in the middle of the night didn't just start last night. Those in the city with some wealth had already sought refuge elsewhere. Li Ma wasn't aware of this. Otherwise, she would have cried to go home as soon as she heard about the war. Perhaps she is already safely home today, spared from being frightened. However, I was speculating why the trains would stop after the troops arrived. Isn't this a huge contradiction in military terms?</p>
<p>I went downstairs, and A'yun and Li Ma were both sitting blankly in the hall, like two molded clay figures. Li Ma, clutching her bundle of clothes, said with a mournful face:</p>
<p>"Young master, one can't even walk on the street anymore!"</p>
<p>"Really, they grab people when they see them," A'yun also said, "I saw it with my own eyes!"</p>
<p>Ignoring their words, I peered out through the gap in the door blocked by the stone mortar and millstone. The street was indeed deserted. Across the street, the door of the Gui Sheng family's house was wide open, and someone who looked like a local was carrying out a load of cabbage from their house.</p>
<p>"Local ruffians are the most terrifying," I thought to myself, "Before the soldiers loot everything, our own people are already carting things away."</p>
<p>The person was slowly approaching. Seeing the worn-out felt hat pressed down to his eyebrows, I was stunned. Wasn't that Gui Sheng? Frantically, I moved the stone mortar and millstone away and opened the door to call out to him.</p>
<p>"Young master, the soldiers have arrived."</p>
<p>He stopped the cabbage load, greeting me as if saying "Good day."</p>
<p>"Li Ma said the 'ash worms' pried open your door, and you jumped into the river and ran away?"</p>
<p>"No, that's not it." He shook his head with a smile, "Last night, for some reason, more than three thousand soldiers suddenly arrived. The temples and schools in the city have all been requisitioned for the troops. Today, they need people to cook, so they're grabbing anyone carrying a vegetable basket. I heard they're paying four small silver coins a day. Just now, two 'ash worms' passed by here. They saw the vegetable garden by the bridge and came to knock on my door to ask. They're willing to pay two dollars a load, which is the best business I've had all year. Young master, I'm</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>sending it into the city, I'll be back later."</p>
<p>I watched Gui Sheng leave, then turned around. A'yun and Li Ma were standing behind me, their faces already wearing smiles. Knowing that they had heard Gui Sheng's words, I asked Li Ma:</p>
<p>"Do you still want to go home?"</p>
<p>She ran back inside, embarrassed. I told A'yun to dig up some vegetables from the garden to make a meal, and I headed to the city.</p>
<p>On the main street, all the shops were closed. The streets were full of soldiers in gray uniforms. If there were any locals, they were helping to carry things. I squeezed into the teahouse I frequented. Besides a few old regulars, it was completely occupied by soldiers. The tea master, Gen Fu, barely nodded to a soldier, trying to strike up a conversation. As I went to use my more or less fluent Northern [dialect] the soldier poured me a cup of tea instead and told me kindly: The front line is very victorious, but the × Yang Bridge was bombed the day before yesterday. Our superiors have deemed it prudent to use your land as a defensive line. There will be no changes within a few days. It is said that the retreat is slow and your land cannot be made a large line丨 More than 3,000 of our brothers have come and there is no place to cook!</p>
<p>Finally, he asked me with a smile: "Are you afraid?"</p>
<p>"What's there to be afraid of if there's no fighting!" They all laughed at what I said.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Big Sale <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— San Duo</p>
<p>Opening a shop, hoping for customers to come, to turn a profit by turning over goods—this simple principle is something everyone knows. So, they put up large advertisements saying "Big Sale," but what they're really telling you is that their profit margins are a bit thinner during these three weeks. Customers are naturally eager for bargains. Two cigarette shops often compete fiercely over a single copper coin difference in the market price. Although there's an element of rivalry involved, it's ultimately for business reasons. I remember that when a "Big Sale" advertisement was posted in the past, customers from other places would come from afar to purchase goods. The annual seasonal sales and the once-a-year ×th anniversary sales were often very profitable for most shops. This is the principle of "small profits, large sales." Both the shops and the customers benefit. In the past two years, ordinary "Big Sales" have lost their original appeal. So, they're resorting to mutual promotions like "buy one get one free," "half price," and using prize coupons with large prizes like cars to maintain business. "Big Sales" are almost held year-round. However, looking at Shanghai's largest department stores, there are still very few customers. We don't ask whether their prices are at a loss or whether they're making even thinner profits. With such extensive advertising, "business" isn't improving. The reason isn't the business itself, but the obvious decline in customers' purchasing power. Then, spinning around desperately on the "Big Sale" carousel, how can they maintain this near-bankruptcy situation!</p>
<h3 id="e304">Fog <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>Fog is beautiful!</p>
<p>Waking up in the morning, I saw a white expanse outside the window, suspecting it was raining. Opening the window, I found it was a milky white fog, covering the entire field, obscuring everything.</p>
<p>After washing my face, I felt bored, so I moved a chair to the window, holding a cup of hot tea in both hands, sipping and watching the beautiful fog, almost forgetting myself.</p>
<p>After a while, the thick fog gradually thinned, and houses and trees closer by could be vaguely seen. People walking in the fog looked as if they were in the clouds. If I didn't feel the warmth of the teacup in my hands, I would have really suspected that I was living in the clouds.</p>
<p>Soon, the fog thinned a bit more, and things further away could also be distinguished. The trees in the distance only showed their tops, clustered together, like islands. At that moment, the gentle sunlight shone in, adding a layer of red to the milky white fog. The exposed treetops in the distance were also draped in golden yellow robes, sparkling like the cheeks of a graceful young woman, yet also like a shattered mirror.</p>
<p>After a while, the fog completely dissipated, and the sky was a lovely azure blue, the fields as clear and moving as if they had been scrubbed clean.</p>
<p>Fog is beautiful!</p>

<h3 id="e312">Alice Faye Discusses the Many Temptations of Hollywood (Part 2) <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Mei</p>
<p>The above are all the temptations outside the studio. However, there are still many temptations directly related to the work of filmmaking. Once you get an opportunity, whether it is as an extra, a small role, or after receiving a small contract,</p>
<p>Film work has a special requirement for actors: being punctual. In Hollywood, everyone working in the film industry must adhere to the rule of "early to bed, early to rise." However, there are many temptations there that constantly urge you to break that rule. You must know that chorus girls can sleep later, so staying up late is not a big deal, but that is not possible for film actors. Because film actors must get up at 6:30 am, or 7:00 am at the latest. After they get up, they have to do their hair and makeup, which takes a lot of time, while the filming work starts as early as 8:30 am or 9:00 am.</p>
<p>People working in the film studio need at least eight hours of sleep every day. If you reach a relatively important position and have to perform or film facial expressions, you must have abundant energy to perform vividly and be full of spirit. Only sufficient sleep can provide that. In front of the camera, even a little bit of fatigue will show. But even if you do not have an important position and do not have many facial expressions to make, eight hours of sleep is especially necessary, because you must always show your spirit, whether in front of the camera or when dealing with people, so that everyone in the studio, whether it is the producer, director, cinematographer, or other workers, has a good impression of you.</p>
<p>The eyes of the cinematographer are the sharpest. One look at your face and he knows if you are filming well or not. His sharp eyes have already seen whether you went out to play last night, whether you stayed up late, or whether you had insomnia. Therefore, no matter what, you must find a way to get eight hours of full sleep before 6:00 am. That means you must go to bed at 10:00 pm. Of course, sometimes staying up late is unavoidable. For example, shooting night scenes and testing films are all tasks that must be done at night. But you must always find ways to compensate for it. Otherwise, you will regret it in the future. But the temptation of Hollywood is precisely at play here. The sunlight of California does indeed have a special magic that makes people unwilling to stay indoors, but the nights and nightlife of California are equally tempting. Although Hollywood's nightlife is different from that of New York, without as many nightclubs as New York, the sheer number of social engagements in the film industry is considerable. They hold parties at home, in hotels, in bars, dance halls, theaters, etc., entertaining friends and colleagues, and it can be every night without exception.</p>
<p>Here, you need to understand that these stars who go out for social engagements are all in "Between pictures" – that is, in the rest period between finishing one film and starting the second. They use this break to wander around and socialize, but you are working or should be trying hard to find work, so how can you sacrifice yourself for others? You think that going to a social event for a while and sitting for a bit will allow you to come back, but once you get there, it is difficult to escape. If you do not have a strong will, you will end up losing the sleep you deserve. Soon, you will feel that these meaningless social engagements are not worthwhile. However, that is not what career-oriented Hollywood wants to force you to do. If you sit for a while, stand up and say, "I have an early call tomorrow, so I have to go first," they will understand and forgive you. Because they know that the work rules of the film studio emphasize time the most.</p>
<p>There is an even worse temptation, which is to watch movies every day. You often justify it to yourself: "This is for my own work." But soon, you will also suffer from sleep deprivation. Because if you leave the studio at 6:00 pm, have dinner, change clothes, and watch all the worthwhile films, you will not be able to go to bed at 10:00 pm. Working hard and diligently cannot be said to be a temptation in itself, but the most common danger for aspiring women who are new to Hollywood is working too much outside the studio and practicing too hard. You are often unwilling to give up your singing and dancing practice, and you often still practice language and drama. Of course, these are all necessary preparations for the future, but you must know how to limit yourself. As the saying goes, "Too much is as bad as too little." Good health is the foundation of everything.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many small temptations that actresses must avoid. First, do not be pretentious (outside the studio). Making every move as if you were an actress will be annoying to people everywhere. Hollywood is no exception. Also, after you have achieved some success, do not become conceited and arrogant. When you read the praise of you in the newspapers, you cannot think that you deserve it.</p>
<p>What Alice Faye said is of course very helpful to aspiring female stars who are new to Hollywood. But film practitioners in Shanghai may also wish to ponder it and take it as timely advice.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e313">Review of "Our Daily Bread" <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Our Daily Bread丨Grand Theater</p>
<p>King Vidor, this great American writer, has already given people a deep impression from his past works. The most appropriate way to understand his style is to look at his life. He has experienced a difficult journey, and from his own life and the lives of his poor companions, he has realized the spirit of mutual assistance and great love between people. The characters appearing in his works are simple and honest good people. At the same time, the bad people he depicts are not absolutely bad, but rather caricatured.</p>
<p>In his works, one can usually appreciate a rich pastoral flavor, so he relatively believes that cities are always the root of evil. However, although the protagonists he creates are sometimes tempted by the harsh environment and go astray, King Vidor ultimately makes them rationally awaken.</p>
<p>Indeed, King Vidor is an idealist. This is because he has come into contact with many of the sorrows of the world, and he cannot help but express dissatisfaction with the real society. However, he cannot deeply understand the roots of social phenomena and only struggles against the evil society with his own self-confidence. Thus, he develops his humanity of mutual assistance and universal love, seeking ideal comfort from the cruel reality.</p>
<p>Regarding his past works, such as the silent film "The Crowd" and the sound films "The Big Parade" and "The Champ," they all consistently express the style described above. Now we must talk about the review of "Our Daily Bread," which he wrote himself.</p>
<p>Here, he takes the issue of unemployment as the theme and attempts to solve this serious social problem. Thus, he has a group of unemployed people reclaim wasteland. There are all kinds of unemployed people here, including artists and escaped prisoners. In this living group, they help each other, love each other, work together, eat together, and live together. They understand each other, blend with each other, and there is no such thing as hatred or grievances. It is even more clearly shown that although the male protagonist is temporarily tempted by money and women, abandoning his original wife and leaving the group, he soon realizes his mistake and works hard to participate in drought relief. Of course, his great ideal is fully expressed here. But his spirit, his great love, gives people great comfort, when people are experiencing extreme distress in reality. It is impossible for us to demand one hundred percent realism from King Vidor, but his sympathy for humanity is full in his works.</p>
<p>Furthermore, let us briefly observe what kind of techniques he used to complete his "Our Daily Bread." As someone who started as a studio laborer, his skilled use of production techniques is naturally flawless. For example, he absolutely does not use unnecessary gimmicks, but the merchant's attitude when the male protagonist exchanges a piano for a chicken is very funny, and the merchant's character is vividly depicted. Similarly, the scene in which the protagonist couple sleeps peacefully in the old farmhouse is very light and harmonious in its simple sketch. However, his strength does not lie here. The main thing is that he portrays the life of the group without any slackness. Especially after the male protagonist returns, it immediately builds to a climax. Whether in terms of musical effects or camera angles, it reaches a perfect state. As for the harmony of tones and the appropriate control of stillness and movement, he grasps the atmosphere before the male protagonist elopes with his lover and the unspoken sadness of the female protagonist very well. In short, this film deserves a higher evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="e314">Review of "The Life of Vergie Winters" <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>The Life of Vergie Winters 丨 Tai Shanghai Strait</p>
<p>This is an old-fashioned film about love above all else.</p>
<p>Louis Bromfield, the writer, makes us see in "The Life of Vergie Winters," whether in the selection of themes, the method of expression, or the worldview displayed by the creative attitude, is relatively conservative and old-fashioned.</p>
<p>He writes about Vergie Winters being slandered and unable to marry the person she loves, while John, who is from a "distinguished family," marries another woman named Laura. After the marriage, John resumes his old relationship with Vergie.</p>
<p>When John wants to divorce Laura and marry Vergie, she advises him to work hard for his future. During this time, Vergie gives birth to a daughter out of wedlock.</p>
<p>As time progresses, John's social status has become quite high, and Vergie's hatred also deepens. For the sake of love, she finally endures.</p>
<p>When her daughter grows up and also talks about love, Laura forces John to announce her origin. Thus, this tragedy unfolds.</p>
<p>John, who has achieved success, says that he can no longer "let this tragedy continue" and decisively wants to give Vergie the status of wife and mother. However, he is shot and killed by Laura, and Vergie is arrested, resulting in "this endless regret."</p>
<p>Here, the author, through Vergie's mouth, says to John: "I don't want anything but your love. I would rather live in the shadows of life." What more can we ask of an author with such a thorough love-only view?</p>
<p>The screenwriter may have been unable to escape the influence of the original work, and the whole play is rather scattered and dull. Especially the first half, from Vergie looking at John's funeral from the window of the prison and beginning to recall the past, until John participates in the election and Vergie gives birth to her daughter, this part is inevitably disorganized. The time expression from 1914 to 1932 is all done by inserting newspaper headlines, which is very monotonous. The repeated coming and going of the wealthy women buying hats also lacks variation.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Ann Harding is better. Her performance of a tragedy full of the bitterness of life is quite moving. John Boles, who plays John, should have had a great performance. Unfortunately, he did not achieve the results he should have.</p>
<h3 id="e315">Lido Theater to Open <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>The Spiritual Paradise in the Minds of Shanghai Citizens</p>
<p>Business starts at 9:15 PM on February 3rd</p>
<p>The newly built Lido Theater at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road is scheduled to officially open at 9:15 PM on February 3rd. The theater was designed by the famous architect Fan Wenzhao. The building is magnificent and purely three-dimensional. The internal equipment, such as the Western Electric sound system, produces sound that is loud, clear, and subtly different. The projector uses a high-density current lamp, which is as bright as silver and does not show a yellow color. The orthophonic paper backing protects sound waves. This is a feature that is not yet commonly equipped in the largest theaters in the city. There is also a large hall upstairs for the audience to rest. It is comparable to the Grand Theater and the Nanjing Theater. The theater specializes in showing the second run of the best European and American films. The first films to be shown include MGM's honorary works of this year, "San Francisco" and "Tarzan and His Mate". The ticket prices are said to be 4, 6, and 8 jiao for daytime shows and 4, 7 jiao, and 1 yuan for evening shows. The illustration shows the exterior of the theater.</p>

<p>— Zhao Chu</p>
<p>Feng Yunshan was giving a speech, and there were more than ten people listening. Brother Xu Er suddenly pushed the door open. Seeing Feng Yunshan, he quickly went forward and pulled him aside, whispering a few words. Feng's expression changed immediately upon hearing what he said, and he hurriedly told everyone to leave. He himself rushed to the Hong family to report the news. At this time, Hong Xiuquan and his wife, Lai, were standing side by side in the corridor, watching his younger sister, Hong Xuanjiao, practice martial arts. Suddenly, Feng Yunshan ran in breathlessly, shouting, "Is Brother Hong here?" Xuanjiao stopped her fist, and Xiuquan greeted him, asking what was the matter. Feng hurriedly said, "The county has already sent people to arrest us. Quickly think of a way to escape!" Hong was stunned and lost his mind. Feng urged him again, saying, "Hurry up, the people arresting us have already come out."</p>
<p>A group of ruthless yamen runners rushed straight to the entrance of the God Worshipping Society. No one answered when they knocked on the door. They broke down the door and found nothing. They shouted in unison, "Let's hurry to the Hong family to arrest them." Everyone swarmed over again. At this time, Hong Xiuquan, Feng Yunshan, Hong's wife, Lai, and Xuanjiao had already escaped. Lai and Xuanjiao changed into village women's attire, each carrying a package. Hong said to Lai and his sister, "Now you have to go to the countryside and hide for a few days. When we have a suitable place, we will send you a message." Lai held onto Xiuquan, wanting to say something. Xiuquan repeatedly said, "This is not the time to talk. Just listen to my message later." He then opened the small door in the back garden and walked out.</p>
<p>The yamen runners rushed in, searching each room without finding anyone. They then gathered in the courtyard. Then they caught an old servant. The old servant was frightened out of his wits. The yamen runners asked him where Hong Xiuquan was hiding. Tell them quickly. The old servant answered tremblingly, "Please spare me, sirs. I really don't know." The yamen runners were furious and punched him. At this time, a man ran in and reported, "I saw Hong Xiuquan and a man riding horses and escaping north." Everyone listened and chased after them like a swarm of bees. Let's say that Hong and Feng were riding on horseback, rushing quickly. Hong said, "Let's still go to Guangxi!" With that, the two whipped their horses, and in an instant they were gone. Fifteen or sixteen yamen runners, riding horses and carrying swords, rushed to the outskirts. They reined in their horses, looking around and discussing where to pursue. As a result, they split into two groups, searching in both directions. Hong and Feng saw pursuing soldiers behind them and whipped their horses even more. When they reached the river, they had to follow the river. A team of men had already detoured to meet them. Another team of men had also chased to the river and were also chasing along the riverbank. Hong and Feng, seeing pursuing soldiers in front and behind, were greatly alarmed. Suddenly, a clever idea came to him. Hong then said to Feng, "We only have this desperate plan to escape." With that, the two immediately dismounted, each whipping the horses behind them. The two horses ran away. The two threw their hats and boots into the river, and they themselves fled along the grassy riverbank. Before leaving, they threw a few large stones, creating turbulent water patterns on the river. Teams A and B met one after another. Someone had already seized the escaped horses of Hong and Feng, but could not find the two men. Later, someone saw the two men's hats and boots floating on the river. At that time, everyone was talking about it. Some people even picked up stones and threw them into the river to test the situation. As a result, the yamen runner said, "I'm afraid they were so anxious that they jumped into the river and died. We'll have to let it go." With that, everyone mounted their horses and returned dejectedly. Over here, Hong and Feng were secretly watching from the reeds. Feng said, "Today was really too dangerous! We almost fell into their hands." Hong Xiuquan, hearing this, sighed and said, "It's a pity they are also Han Chinese. Why do they have to force us to this point!" (To be continued)</p>
