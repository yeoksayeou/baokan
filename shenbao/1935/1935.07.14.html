<h3>歐局糾紛中之國聯威信觀</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>歐局之糾紛。自大戰而後。始終存在。然其阮陧不安。至近數年尤甚。蘇俄以外。謀歐局之安定者。有二國焉。卽法與英。其安定之方法。大抵藉國聯之機構。作解决一切糾紛之要鑰。故國聯威信之重振。實力之補充。胥爲安定歐局必要之步驟自。去年以來。以法國外交努力之結果。始則有法俄之協調。維則有蘇俄之加入國聯。使日德退出後之國聯。增一生力軍。今春又有法意恊定之成立。使十數年來兩國之猜嫌忌嫉。明爭暗鬥。爲之消釋於一旦。歐局紛亂之象。因亦大見澄淸。其後英法倫敦宣言。對於安定歐局。表示一致意見。及至斯特拉薩會議。英法意三國外交陣綫。尤見齊一。當時談國際情勢者。幾皆視爲歐局和平之一大轉機。孰意國聯威信猶未全復。法人錦囊中之各種公約猶未實現。而國聯又遭嚴重之難關。歌局之矛盾。亦愈尖銳化矣。</p>
<p>今次歐局所以重趨複雜之原因。仍在英法意三國之利害不能一致。最顯著者。卽三國對於國聯態度之歧異。在法國之心目中。國聯者純係一東縛德國之工具。其目的僅在歐洲之和平。至於國聯在歐洲以外。有無權威。卽不暇過問。意大利則對於國聯。向無好感。最近所以對之略其熱誠者。大可視爲酬答法國好意之表示。蓋其所求。不過爲保持中歐之和平。除此而外。無須借重國聯也。其具有世界眼光。欲使國聯成爲維持國際和平之機關者。僅有英國。然英亦不無可以訾議之處。三國對於國聯。態度雖各不同。要皆以自身之利害爲立塲。國聯可供其利用時。則利用之。若妨礙其行動。則視同無物焉。如意大利逞其殖民地之慾望。竟公然反對國聯之干涉。而法國爲保持意大利之好感計。非獨對意行動置。若罔聞。且於英國請求恊同千涉時。仍一味推諉。不欲開罪於意。若是者。豈非一面擁護國聯。他方摧殘國聯之矛盾行爲耶。如此而謀國聯椎成之確立。不亦難哉。至於英國。今次突然與德成立海軍恊定一舉。嚴格言之。亦不能不謂爲對於國聯精神上之一種打擊。蓋按照國聯會章十九條之規定。和約之修改。本須獲得國聯大會之通過。德國重整軍備。雖未可厚非。然英國未得國聯之同意。而遽與德國成立海約。自法理上說。究與國聯會章不甚相符。是英國擁護國聯之精神亦。有前後不相一致之處。今欲自居於國聯盟主之地位。對意施行干涉。無怪爲意反唇相譏也。</p>
<p>總之。於今日之歐洲諸大國中。能絕對遵循國聯之會章。始終顧全國聯之威信者。實無一國。意火利對於國聯固爲明目張膽之破壞。法國對於國聯。亦未竭誠擁護。英國態度。又非始終一貫。故以現勢而論。欲求國聯權成之確立。歐洲局勢之安定。世界和平之確保。去事實猶甚遠也。</p>

<p>—在成都出席擴大紀念週—</p>
<p>成都通訊、八日晨九時、蔣委員長蒞蓉第六次擴大紀念週、在皇城至公堂前面空壩舉行、計到蔣委員長·楊秘書長·賀主任·劉主席·鄧軍長·劉軍長·各軍將領·各黨政機關·各法團·各報館·各學校職員代表·曁全市童子軍·各校軍訓生·以及會考全體學生、共六千餘人、由蔣委員長領導行禮如儀後、即席訓詞如後、</p>
<p>「劉主席·各位校長·教職員先生·軍訓團及童子軍各男女學生、今天集合大家在四川大學舉行總理紀念週、這是一個很難得機會、中正是中華民國全國童子軍的總司令、亦爲全國軍訓團的總敎官、你們童子軍和軍訓學生、以及一般中學參加會考的學生、都是我的學生、也就是我的子弟、所以今天特別召集大家將你們應負的責任和應有的修養吿訴你們、鈽望大家特別汴意、</p>
<p>現在我們國家民族受人家的侵略壓迫、不能獨立自由、弄到這般困靴危急的地步、這是什麽道理呢、這個道理、你們是不可不澈底瞭解的、因爲你們是國家未來的主人翁、今後我們要如何繼往開來、轉危爲安、轉弱爲强、恢復國家民族的獨立與自由、這個責任、就完全在你們一般靑年的身上、現在一般年紀火的人、再過二三十年就要死去、將來天下國家的責任、全靠你們能繼續的担負起來、你們如果能够及時努力發奮圖强、使國家能够獨立、民族能夠自山、便可以增加國家民放的光榮、就是你們的光榮、反之、如果國家民族不能達到獨立自由的地位、最後國家亡了、就要做人家的奴隸牛馬、受苦受難、而且使後世子孫孫、都不知要受折磨到那一天、你們總要記住、我們中華民族自族布以來、繼續繩繩、將此錦繡山河與高尙的文化、傳給我們、現在有這樣大的土地、這樣好的文化、更有這樣冬的同胞、如果我們不能救亡復興、繼往開來、恢復我們已往的光榮、造成獨立自由的新國家、以完成我們偉大的歷史使命、那我們就寃枉生在這個世界上、愧對我們的黄帝祖宗和我們的父母、所以你們將來要做國家的主人翁、就一定要以天下國家爲已任、以救國救民爲唯一之職志、</p>
<p>我們要使國家能够獨立、使民族能够自由、第一就應該健全我們木身、即須時時刻努力來鍜鍊强健的體魄、修養高尙的人格、造就豐富的智能發揚剛毅勇敢的精神、養成刻苦耐勞與重紀律守秩序的習慣、造成一個獨立國家的健全國民、有了這種健全的國民、國家民族、才有獨立自由的穩固基礎、有了這個基礎、然後才可以建立自山獨立的新國家、然後才可以復興民族、其次、我們要求國家民族的自由平等、就要犧牲個人的自由、以求國家的自由、犧牲我們個人的平等、以求民族的平等、必須將我們個人的一切、統統貢獻於國家民旗、才可以求得整個國家民族的自由平等、如果我們個人要講自山、國家民族便要受人家的壓迫、我們個人要講平等、國家民族的地位、便要低落最後要連國家的生有都不保、大家要知道、所謂國家的自由平等是什麽意義呢、就是自己有完整的領土與主權、獨立的精利與國格、我們要怎樣犧牲個人的自由平等、來求國家的自由平等呢、就是隨時隨地要能嚴守紀律、服從命令、在家庭就要服從家長、遵守家規、在學校就要服從師長、遵守校規、在童子軍和軍訓團裏面、就要服從隊長·排長·班長、遵守軍紀團規、在社會上、就要服從各級政府、尊守一切法令，必須我們能嚴守紀律、服從領袖、集中大家的精神能力、來爲國家社會而用用、這個國家、才算是眞正有組織的現代國家、然後才能產生整個的力量、來爭取自由平等、保障我們五千年來的光榮、將來你們自己和你們的子子孫孫、才可以做中華民國眞正的主人翁、這是你們最應明白的做人道理、和應負的責任、如果你們還不明白這些、救國的道理和責任、徒然戴了童子軍軍帽軍服、或穿了學生的制服、而實際上對於國家民族的前途、全不負責、只是麻木不仁、得過且過、那就不配做中華民國的一個國民、更不配做國家的主人翁、以上是講我們一般靑年的責任、在爭取國家民族的自由平等、在挽救國家復興民族、以下再將我們一個人、尤其是我們一般靑年在各種不同的範圍中所居的地位與應負的責任、分別講一講、</p>
<p>第一、要認識人在宇宙中的地位和責任、我就敎職員當學生入學之初、第一件要緊的事情、就是要吿訴他們天地父母生下我們一個、尤其是做了一個知識階級的人、在宇宙間所處的地位、是怎樣的、所負的責任、又是什麼、一定先要使他們都能明白這個道理、才能敎好他們做成一個人、要曉得人爲萬物之靈、亦即宇宙之主宰、應當要發揮我們的聰明聰力、來認識宇宙、宰制宇宙、征服自然、利用自然、而不斷的創進人類的文化、宇宙開萬事萬物、無論聲·光·電·力、無論動·植·礦·物、我們人人都要能够發揮才智、來宰制一切、征服一切、利用一切、使無用的變成有用、有害變成有利、例如洪水爲患、我們就要設法疏導、以興水利、獸類爲患、我們就要剷除獲馴服牠、對於自然的征服與利用、我們祖先自古以來、就非常注意的、例如神農發明醫藥、使人民的病痛得到解救、黄帝作宮室、造舟車、並發明指南針、以利居住交通、　祖發明養蠶製絲、使人民有衣穿、后稷發明稼穡、使人民有飯　、大禹治洪水、使人民能够安居、這都是征服與利用自然、以增進人類生活、創造人類文明的偉績、現在人類文明、如此突飛猛進、也都是由於人類充分發揮天賦的才智、控制宇宙征服自然而然、宇宙間一切自然的東西、品類萬殊、無不待我們去利用、人類永無止境之新的文明、也都待我們去創造、從前我們祖宗、很能發揮其智能、而不斷的創進文明、所以我們從前國家非常强盛、現在我們做子孫的人、不能發揮聰明、繼續創造新的文明、由於一不進則退」的公例、致使國家日陷於貧弱、民生日趨於凋敝、由此可知、我們今後要想救轉國家民族、使能臻於富强之域、就要充分的發揮我們民族固有的智能、來不斷的宰制宇宙、征服自然、創造新的文明、如此、才不愧爲黄帝的子孫、和中華民國的國民、</p>
<p>第二、要認識我們在國家的地位與責任、我們一般靑年學生、在國家的地位與責任、我在前面已經大概講明、你們是國家將來的主人翁、將來國家尺族的興亡盛衰之責、全在你們身上、可見你們所處地位、何等重要、所負的責任、又何等重大、你們今後就要自任以天下國家之重、奮發努力、自立自强、切實負起繼往開來的責任、保持我中華民族五千年來光榮的歷史、並從而發揚光大、造成白由獨京的三民主義的國家、巍然屹立於宇宙、爲我們四萬萬同胞謀幸福、爲我們子子孫孫立一萬古不拔的根基、</p>
<p>第三、要認識我們在社會中的地位與責任、你們大家是社會上的知識份子、是社會的中堅、你們的才智能力、都比普通一般民衆要高、你們所處的境遇、都比普通一般民衆要好、所以你們對於社會的責任、也格外要大、這種責任是什麽呢、槪括的講、就是要爲社會而勞動服務、爲人羣來謀利造幅、尤其要見義　爲、救助一般窮苦的同胞、你們童子軍有一條最要緊的信條、即「一日行一善」、意思就是說我們要以愛人之心、推愛社會一般同胞、每天總要做一件帮助他人或有益社會的事、要使人家和我們一樣有衣穿、有飯吃、沒有痛苦、同享安樂、這就是古人「己飢已溺」、「民胞物與」的精神、古人又謂、「士當先天下之憂而憂、後天下之樂而樂」、可見我們智識份子、對於一般同胞的痛苦、應該特別關切、盡量帮助、才算是盡到了我們的責任、所以絕對不好只管自己個人的溫飽安樂、必須時刻紀念一般同胞的凍餒疾苦、你們大家都看到的、現在四川社會上、不知有多少顚連無告流離失所的同胞、你們一出門、就可看見一般勞苦的同胞、面黃骨瘦、火勢推車子的推不動、或是負東西的負不起、汗如雨下、勞憊異常、然而却不得不勉强掙扎、以圖生存、他們是如何的痛苦、我們應該隨時隨地去帮助他們、减少他們的痛苦、你們要曉得外國人尤其是靑年學生、他們凡是看見旁人病倒、或是跌倒在道路上、就趕快扶助他、看見旁人車子推不動、或是車子翻倒、就儘先去帮助他、看見旁人有什麼災難、無不竭力援助、他們已養成這種普遍的勞動服務的精神和習慣、現在我們中國人却往往與此相反、一般無知識的人不必說、就是你們一般童子軍和受軍訓的學生、恐怕也很少人眞能爲社會勞動服務、甚至許多人就根本不勞動、舉一件最普通的事來說、我在街上到處看是你們很多學生、甚至童子軍、都要坐黄包車、你們自己不爲長者拉車子、不爲社會服役、已經是沒有盡到責任、那裏好反要人家拉你們走、如果沒有不得已的情形、這是很不對的、你們要知道、一個人生在社會上、應該以勞動爲生活、以服務爲本分、如果四體不勤、好逸惡勞、就會變成社會上的寄生蟲、做了寄生蟲、結果就要變成亡國奴、我們受了社會的培養、應該要爲社會謀幸福、要爲社會謀幸福、首先就要能刻苦勞動、自己任何事情、都要自己做、自己做不到的、再請朋友帮忙、同時自己又應該隨時隨地盡心盡力來帮助別人、尤其是應該救助一般痛苦的同胞、看見路上有人跌倒、就要扶起他、有人病倒、就要救護他、拉車的和負重的、拉不動或負不起、就要帮助他、這些事都是我們服務社會與造福人類的起點、也就是我們每個人對社會應盡的務、　（未完）</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>全運會國術規則訂定公布（一）　拳術器械二項已改表演賽其他各項仍以比賽分勝負全部項目計男十五女十一條文已改其舊觀方法亦變</h3>
<p>第六屆全國運動大會國術比賽規則、業經競賽委員會審查修正通過、先行公布、將來再交籌備委員會追認此項規則、起草時係以上屆大會之規則爲一基礎、同時採納國術股股長及若干國術專家之意見、並參照一般比賽方法之原則、融會貫通而成、計由初稿而研究斟酌、而一再修改、中間曾多次易稿、始交由競賽委員會寨查通過、前後費時、凡七十餘小時、內容方面、可稱比較的完善、</p>
<p>本屆規則最大之變更、爲拳術與器械兩項、均已改為表演比賽、按表演功夫之高下、判分各人之名次、晚近國術專家、原多見地不一、有主張比賽者、有主張表演者、實則兩法均屬合理、各有優點、全運會鑒於各省市國術館有省考市考之舉行、中央則更有國考之舉行、俱係應用比賽方法、產生名器而修武德、故此次大會、特將兩項比賽改爲表演、使二法相輔而行、未始不善、至摔角射箭·彈丸·踢毽·及測力等等、則均一承其舊、悉用比賽以分勝負、惟方法上已極多改變、較諸上屆之規則、爲具體而科學化矣、規則之全文、凡九童四十一條、</p>
<p>本屆大會因競賽規程之變更、國術已改爲尋常錦標之一、不再另設總錦標、故先前之拳術錦標、器械錦標等等、已成爲今日之一項目、項目總數、計男子部十五、女子部十一、每項各錄取六各或六對、（拳術有對手拳、器械亦有對手器械、）均以七五四三二一計分、按各單位所得總分之多寡、判分其名位、此亦爲本屆規則之一大變史、本屆規則除男子部之摔角及側力兩項、各按體重分爲重量中量、輕量三級、以昶公允外、其餘各項、槪部分級、上兩項之分級標準、亦經修正、又射箭及彈丸之用、抽象方法評定成績、判分名次者、今則一律刪除、並易以其他合理之方法評定之、他如測力比賽、本屆亦有具體辦法之列入、總觀全文、條理淸楚、可以一目瞭然、惟摔角淘汰比賽達半複賽週後、從八人中比出六人之名次、所用方法、則比較複雜耳、茲將規則條文、錄誌於後、</p>

<h3>禮儀（小講壇）</h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>我們中國，從古自號爲禮義之邦。現在蔣委員長提倡新生活運動，第一便著重這個禮字。</p>
<p>人類是有教育的動物。受了教育，便要懂得禮儀。不懂得禮儀的人，雖然有才幹，也不好在社會上做事，不講禮義的民族，雖然富强，不能維持世界的和平。</p>
<p>三千年前，我們有一首古詩：「相鼠有皮，人而無禮。人而無禮，胡不遄死！」把它改成現代話，那便是說：「你看老蟲身上尙且有毛有皮，做人那裏可以沒有禮。做人若沒有禮，怎得不自速其死！」</p>
<p>沒有禮，何以便會死呢？孔夫子說：「勇而無禮則亂」。個人的叛國造反，民族的侵侮弱小，一味窮兵　武，這種個人，這種民族，結果不是自殺，便是被殺。豈不是自速其死嗎？</p>
<p>這些話，範圍說得太大了。這裏，我們只從個人的本身說起，怎樣呌做禮儀？</p>
<p>要懂得做人的禮儀，必須學習良好的態度。要有良好的態度，必須具備著「和氣」，「謙遜」，「誠懇」，三種內心的要素。</p>
<p>簡單的講一句：便是彼此大家都要以親愛精誠相待。內裏有了誠意，外表上才會顯出良好的禮儀。（時事研究）</p>
<h3>大水又來了（時事研究）</h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>小朋友們，大水又來了！這幾天報紙上，天天記着：漢口，南京，安徽，江西，開封，廣州，都發大水；有些鄉村，整個兒被大水冲沒了；有些都市，水巳經上街了。想不到民國二十年的大水災，剛過四年，再來一次！</p>
<p>想起那一年的水災，受災的省分有十六省，財產與生命，損失不計其數，難道我們中國老百姓，今年又要吃一次大苦頭麼？</p>
<p>有人說：「這是天災，天老爺要我們百姓吃苦，那是沒有法子的」，但是，小朋友們，我們要想一想：這眞是沒有法子的事麼？我們要知道：歐美各國以前也是常常發大水的，後來他們利用科學，疏濬河道，增植森林，近年來就不大聽見發大水了。可是我們中國，單是滿淸一代，大水就發過二百多次。民國以來，大水災也已發過三四次，小水災是更多了；這是沒有法子呢，還是不肯想法子，和不肯實行好法子呢？</p>
<p>講到水災的厲害，比起火災來，不知要超過幾萬倍，請看下面的一段紀事：</p>
<p>「婺源（安徽省的一縣）於二十五，二十七兩天，畫夜傾盆大雨，山上的洪水暴發，好像地裂山崩，水從地中直射數十丈，白浪成羣結隊地追趕，好像撑天的銀柱子一般。山中的大石塊大木頭，跟着水衝下來，百餘里的田園，一閃眼間被砂石堆積成山。波濤中，一個個的浮屍，漂來漂去。全縣一片汪洋，完全變成水國了……」</p>
<p>小朋友，看了這段紀事之後，你們的心裏感覺怎樣？</p>
<p>小朋友，在這大災難的時代，我以爲，我們應該做下面幾件事：（一）研究發生水災的原因和防止的方法（二）節省糖菓錢，救濟難民，（三）預備參加募捐賑災的工作。</p>
<p>你們以爲怎樣？</p>
<h3>小朋友的敎師</h3>
<p>— 鐵吾</p>
<p>紅日落，</p>
<p>靑天高，</p>
<p>樹梢的蟬兒聲聲呌，</p>
<p>好像是道：</p>
<p>「小朋友呀！</p>
<p>國難嚴重，</p>
<p>「知了？」「知了」？</p>
<p>雨初霽，</p>
<p>天乍晴，</p>
<p>畦畔的靑蛙「閣　一鳴，</p>
<p>好像是說：</p>
<p>「小朋友呀！</p>
<p>願你們大了，</p>
<p>「救國！」「救民！」</p>
<h3>夏季的衣服（常識）</h3>
<p>— 榕</p>
<p>在　星期六下午，敏兒同聰兒到街上去散步，看見街上的行人都穿着白色的衣服，敏兒奇怪極了，他便起了好奇心；回頭去問他的哥哥聰兒：「現在他們爲什麼都穿着白色的衣服呢？」聰兒回答他：「敏弟，這因爲在夏天的時侯天氣很熱，穿了白色的衣服，能把陽光反射，若穿了黑色的衣服，能吸收陽光，不如穿白色衣服，來得風凉了，敏兒很疑惑的問着：聰哥，我有些不相信，你能不能實騐給我看。」聰兒說：「敏弟，你不相信，等我們回家後，我實騐給你看。」敏兒聽見有實騐看，所以別的東西都不要看，一心一意催着他的哥哥快快回家，聰兒說：「敏弟，現在時候還早，你爲什麼急急回家呢？」敏兒說：「聰哥，我急急的回家，便要看你的實騐呀！」聰兒說：「原來如此，那麼讓我買些實騐的用品。「一面說，一面摸着衣袋，向　冰灘上買了五個銅子的冰，便和弟弟急急回家。</p>
<p>一會兒，到了家裏，聰兒預備了一塊　布和一塊黑布，敏兒看着剛才買來的兩塊冰，一些也不懂，又問他的哥哥：「這些東西有什麼用處？聰兒回答他的弟弟說：「你看着，便會知道的。」聰兒把白色和黑色的布各紮了一塊冰，放在陽光中晒，不久，黑布紮的冰很快的溶化了，而白布紥的冰溶化得很慢。聰兒說：「敏弟，你現在總知道了，夏季穿白色的衣服，就是反射陽光，可减少熱力，冬季穿黑色的衣服就是吸收陽光，所以覺得暖熱了。」</p>
<h3>平原和高山（寓言）</h3>
<p>— 公望</p>
<p>平　原對高山說道：「先生，我要問你，你在世上有甚麼用處？我看見你裸露的頭顱和高入雲中的額角，我一生沒有看見你的用處…」</p>
<p>高山說：「先生，那麼請你告我你有甚麼用處呢？」</p>
<p>「你豈不知道我的用處嗎？你豈不看見我出產穀，糖，麥等等供給人們的需要嗎？無數的牛羊吃我胸前所生的靑草，雨降在我的身上，大川小溪來濕潤我；人們把我的出產貯藏起來，船可在河上通航天下，你怎麼說我沒有用處呢」？</p>
<p>高山說：「先生，我不來和你計較，但你不能缺我，你的一草一葉都要我的水來灌漑。沒有我，大川小溪便要乾涸，花草樹木就不能生存，你就要變成一片沙漠…」</p>
<h3>兒童科學講座植物的花</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>花，是植物的重要部分，顯花植物中的花，更是他的生命線。假如沒有花，他就永不會繁殖。一朶花，在我們看來，好像是很簡單的，有的小朋友看了很喜歡，就把他折了下來，奇是在植物本身，却是喪失他一部分的生命。每朶花，大槪可以分成四部分。（圖一）四部分的名稱；就是　，花冠，雄蕊，雄蕊。萼是綠色的，在花冠的最外部。他的形狀很多，有的像管子一樣，有的像漏斗一樣，有的像唇，有的像壺。（圖二）。大半在開花時脫落，有的却和花冠同時脫落的。他是保護花的蓓蕾的。花冠的形狀更多，跟隨植物的種類而分別。有鐘形，有唇形，有舌形，有翼形，有蝶形。（圖三）花冠裏面，有細長的花絲，上端有粉囊的叫做雄蕊。雄蕊的數量很多。在許多雄蕊包圍中，有一根較粗大的花柱，下端有子房，上端有柱頭，中藏胚珠。（圖四）這柱頭中的胚珠，和雌蕊上端的花粉結合的時候，就會結果實，果實就是植物繁殖的命脈。這花粉與胚珠的結合，有的借着昆蟲的力量，像桃花，梅花，李花。這些花有顏色有香味，還分泌蜜汁，來引誘昆蟲替他們傳送花粉，而結果實。這種花稱爲蟲媒花。（圖五）另一種花是利用風力來傳佈花粉的，他們沒有顏色，沒有香味，也沒有甜蜜，因此，昆蟲類不會去採花，像稻，麥，蒲公英等，他們稱爲風媒花。（圖六）</p>
<h3>怎樣組織一個暑假讀書會？（研究）</h3>
<p>— 沈承昭</p>
<p>親　愛的小朋友們，光陰過的多快，貶貶眼，一年一度的暑假又降臨了。</p>
<p>近二個月的長長的暑假難道我們整天玩要着，任寳貴的光陰溜走嗎？任在學校裏讀過的書忘記還給先生嗎？不，决不，我們該想法子，不但使讀過的書不忘記，並且還要使我們的腦筋裏增加些知識才好。</p>
<p>最好的法子，便是立刻起來組織一個暑假讀書會。讀書有了組織，也就有趣味了。</p>
<p>至於暑假讀書會組織的方法，請瞧左面：</p>
<p>（一）集合三五人爲基本會員，負借書，還書，召集會議，評判甲乙職責。</p>
<p>（二）普通會員十人至二十人，每五人爲一組，每一組裏讀的書，大家議定。其次關於時間，分量，及期限也由太家預先商量好。讀完了，便再聚在一起，各會員各報告讀書的興趣和心得。</p>
<p>（三）各組還有比賽，那組看的書多，那組報告明白，那組頂不行。由基本會員評判之。</p>
<p>（四）疑難不懂的地方，可以大家提出來討論。</p>
<p>（五）每星期茶話一次。（時間，會塲自定）</p>
<p>（六）會員每人小洋兩角。（購買書報茶點之用）</p>
<p>好了，時間寳貴，小朋友們，大家快起來實行吧！</p>

<h3>參觀德國新郵船記</h3>
<p>— 上海協進小學三年級生林典議</p>
<p>六月二十七日上午十時，四伯父同二兄坐汽車來接爸爸姊姊和我到公和祥碼頭去參觀北德公司新郵船香霍斯脫號。到了船上，看見起重機從貨艙裏吊各種貨物，有的吊在駁船上，有的吊在碼頭上。到各種房間參觀，設備淸潔華麗，另有孩童遊戲塲，艙面有露天游泳池兩隻。再到船主行船處，在羅盤針邊，同姊姊站在一起，由二兄替我們拍照，以留紀念。後來到會客室裏，看見兩幅油畫，一幅是歐戰名將德國總統興登堡，他是已經去世了，一幅是繼任元首希特勒。他們都是德國民族英雄，保衛國家，抵抗外侮，値得紀念和崇拜的。希望我國也能够多產生這種英雄。觀畢已經十二點　了，就坐汽車回家。</p>
<h3>奢望（印度童話）</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>在某一個鎭上，住着一個織布匠。一天，他的織布機上的木拴都折碎了。他拿了一枝斧頭，跑到外面去找尋木頭。他跑到海灘上，看見一棵大菩提樹，便心裏想：「這棵樹樣子長得不錯，要是把它砍倒，我就可以製造許多織布機上的零件哩。」他道麼想，便提起斧頭對它劈下去。</p>
<p>這當兒，住在這大樹中的一位仙人走出來說道：「朋友，這稞樹是我的家，我住在這裏很快活，請你保全它吧。」</p>
<p>「可是，先生」那織布匠回答，「保全你的家就是餓死我的家人，因爲藉以養活我的家人的織布機現在缺少木拴啦。所以，請你搬到別地方去住，而且要快。我要砍倒這棵樹。」</p>
<p>仙人說，「先生，旣然如此，你要什麼我就一給你什麼，只要你保全這棵樹，」</p>
<p>「那麼」，織布匠說，「讓我回去問過我的朋友和我的妻再來吧。」仙人應允了，織布匠就動身回家。走到鎭上，他碰見他的朋友理髮匠！他說：「朋友，就位仙人應允我，我要什麼他就給我什麼。告訴我要些什麼。」</p>
<p>理髪匠回答：「朋友，要是當眞如此，你就去要一個王國吧。你可以做皇帝，我可以做宰相，難道世上還有比這更好的東西嗎？」</p>
<p>織布匠回到家中，對他的妻說道：「親愛的妻，今天有一位仙人應允我，我要什麽他就給我什麼。你想想看，我得要些什麼？我的朋友那理髮匠告訴我，呌我去要一個王國。」</p>
<p>「親愛的丈夫，」妻說，「別聽那理髪匠的話。做國王是最麻煩最不太平的事情，還是去要別的東西吧。」</p>
<p>「什麼東西，你說？」</p>
<p>「以前你每天織成一匹布，足够我們一天開銷。現在，你去要求多生一個頭，多生兩隻手臂，那麼你每天可以前面織一匹布，後面織一匹布。一匹布足够我們一天開銷，，另一匹布的錢，你可以留下來，將來好過快活日子。」</p>
<p>織布匠很高興，說道：「眞是一個好主意，我决定聽你的話。」</p>
<p>織布匠走到仙人那裏，說明他的要求：「仙人，請你給我第二個頭，第二　手臂。」　　完話，他巳變成一個兩頭四臂的人。</p>
<p>織布匠走回家中，心裏非常快活。百姓看到他，當他是一個妖怪，大家拿棍棒敲他，拿石頭　他，他死在路上，家裏留着一架破布機</p>
<p>請讀者注意　中國兒童文化協會，今日午刻十二時至一時，假新新電臺（週波七八〇）播音，請何公超先生演講「怎樣做一個現代的兒童」。張友鑑先生講「爲樹犧牲」故事。及該會組織之兒童歌唱團播送歌唱。屆時請小朋友注意收聽。又該會正在廣徵男女及兒童會員，願加入者可向河南路四五七號二樓該會函素章程。</p>
<h3>水手辛白德傳（二六）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>我有好多時繼續着這游獵之戲，每天有一頭象死在我的弓下，一天，我正在樹上，守望着這些獸畜，見有一大羣出現了。地上因它們而震動，而它們所做出來的聲音使我滿心的害怕。</p>
<p>它們圍住了我所坐的樹，它們的小小黑眼始終注着我；它們給我這麼的一嚇，我的弓從手中掉落了。</p>
<p>一頭大獸走近樹來，將它的鼻繞住了樹，猛拖一下，於是那樹運根拔起，拋在地上。</p>
<p>自然，我和這樹一同倒了。那大象來到我身邊，將它的鼻，捲我起來，放在它的背上，我不知要發生甚麼事，直　得半死的躺着。</p>
<p>於是全群和我同去，直到它們到了一個遠遠的所在了，接着我便放在地上。</p>
<p>這一來，它們便遺下我而去了。我一確定他們都巳去後，就掙起身來：郤正我是在一座大山上，四面散布着死象的骨和齒。</p>
<p>我此刻才明白那些畜生爲甚麼帶我到這裏來了，它們知道我殺死它們是爲了它們的牙齒，以爲我要是一知道這些骨兒，便可停止殺死它們咧。</p>
<p>我並不耽延，立刻出發到鎭中去。我到了那邊，便去找尋那買我的人將我的消息吿知他。</p>
<p>他樂於見我，因爲他曾到過林中，見我的弓正掉在一株連根拔起的樹近邊。他見了這些東西，心想那些畜生巳殺害我了。</p>
<p>我將一切經過和我山上所見告知他。第二天我們一同出去得了大批的象牙。</p>
<p>我們因去後，他說：「辛白德，我不再像奴隸般待你，你可以自由，我且和你說爲甚麼如此。我先前雖並沒有和你說，那些林中的象會殺死過好多奴隸，也像你那麼爲了要它們的牙齒之故，派去射殺它們的。你並沒有受傷，這顯得上帝看顧你，所以畜生們不能傷害你了。你在山上所發見的東西給我一筆大財！我就還你自由，使你富足。」</p>
<p>我聽了這番話，忙說：「我主，願上帝看顧你。我不要財富；如今我巳自由了，願意離去此地回到我的故鄉去。」</p>
<p>他道：「使得你可以如此做，我付你些云的一切費用。不久有船來買我們所有的象牙，你就可以搭了內中的一艘船回家了。」</p>
<p>我祇得和他同住了幾天，等候那船隻進口的時期。</p>

<h3>糧食　粉麥跌勢又猛</h3>
<p>粉市昨又見暴落、以洋麥報價、芝加哥又跌五六角左右、坎拿大跌一角零、市塲人心一致觀望、良以國內經濟、均在堅縮之際、公私之購買力、亦自然不振、本年長江災區、旣重且大、無論如何、當有一部分之吸力、目下寂然無動、國外趨勢又不佳、故開價均見疲弱也、迨下午開價、近期人心又見大虛、因實銷不動、多頭祇好回出、跌勢遂猛、遠期各月份則傳廠方及行一家、又有洋麥定　、價四元四角至四角一分、是以拋戶　轉價亦　落無巳也、結果本月份竟跌三分之巨、八月份跌三分、九月份跌二分半、十月份跌二分二厘半、十一月份跌二分、十二月份跌一分半云、</p>
<p>麥市昨一致見疲、因洋麥報價、仍然繼跌、而現貨之兜售、又不絕於途、且國內新麥登塲不久、即有此種現象、後之視今、自然愈不堪設想、買戶之沉寂、有　來也、至近期有現麥套頭、遠期洋麥之套入、故喊價一致鬆動、結果本月份跌三分、八月份跌三分、九十月份跌四分、十一月份跌七分、現麥同行家直接配廠者、約有一干餘包、價開三元二角七八分至三角半、惟公會市塲、則未正式掛出云、</p>

<h3>天氣晴熱米價又跌</h3>
<p>本米　滬南昨日各帮來源共到二十三四號（貨共四千七八百石）、跌風尤見猛烈、竟有一落千丈之概、各厚粳及薄稻等銷塲續呆、行情再度暴跌一二角三四角不等、包胃僅青島帮辦百餘包、陰戀元被低、滬北昨日河下各路到船十八九號、市上各貨去胃、白粳有貶價者稍化、高貨小二角、中次者價小三四角不等、早薄稻零銷亦滯、價小二三角、白元零化仍呆、價又小　外、其餘各貨亦小一角左右、</p>
<p>洋米市况、長江去化雖活、然形勢續見軟賜、因天氣炎熱後、河下米頗多急求脫手、中次洋米亦復求售甚亟、高洋米則有到貨、市面巳形不振、而昨日長江去化略减、內地本街更爲淸淡即有應酬吃價甚緊、因此高次各描一律轉居平軟、但以長江水災嚴重、此後定有暢辦之必要、故行情尙能拉住、昨日全日開出西買米七千包、高貢小絞蘇粳地暹羅等四千包、價與前市相似、</p>
<h3>豆餅跌風亦頗銳厲</h3>
<p>昨日豆餅市價、一日間有七八分之下跌、蓋為晨市問津極少、致一般小囤戶急欲出籥、喊價比較廠盤、相離頗遠、即有零星去路、親同珍獲、所以銷塲亦有萬餘片成交、黃豆去路祇有本街少數動動、</p>
<h3>五金　靑鉛鐵跌價一元餘</h3>
<p>靑鉛鐵新近交易、因玩具廠要貨廠均停止採辦、是以市情十分呆木、標準因環境不良、頻跌不巳、劃價每二百磅估十八元五角、比前跌一元半、即新貨方面繼續裝來、故市價方而有再跌之憂也、此外會司鐵行情因受外滙趨緊關係、尙覺挺秀、每　開二十七元五角、七較次者亦開二十六元五角、聞昨日開出百餘箱云、</p>
<h3>落令後之黑鐵皮</h3>
<p>近來黑鐵皮銷路已有時過景遷之勢、客帮已　　　、本街廠家亦衹有少許買賣、市情甚爲寂寞、各市標準紛紛報跌、查昨交祗七八十担、行情二六尺十八張花色估六元五角、三六尺三張至十張扯花色估七元、聞供過於求、人心恐怖、來日行情仍防再小也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　抽芯珍眉銷暢價漲</h3>
<p>昨婺源屯溪等路抽芯珍眉綠茶、英商協和同孚長裕保昌等行、及華茶公司、均因國外需求殷亟、紛起搜辦、銷路異常暢達、速日到貨、幾無停留、市况頗形俏利、最高市盤、業已開至一百二十四元、較前提漲二三元、普通珍眉針眉珠芳貢熙等花色、市面亦均穩定、低莊次貨、形勢似較前活潑、市情已臻穩固之境、</p>
<h3>南北貨　湘蓮因水患報歉</h3>
<p>漢申市價大緊</p>
<p>湘蓮昨據漢口函訊、湘西因水患、收成勢必歉薄、來源被阻、市勢突緊、因此中市售盤、呌升三元不一、如殼裏新九溪蓮呌售三十三四元、陳貨跟緊、惟各行存底、本巳不厚、大部份均存貯冷氣棧內、茲聞此訊、前途漲價益有把握、堅守愈力、將來高貨有看四十六七元之希望、新木耳昨據漢口電訊、因來源爲水所阻、到貨　斷、地價轉來、昨口耳爲八十六七元、或將　九十元、此間行盤如頂上航空小包木耳、仍售一百〇五六元、餘照退、後市有隨緊象、</p>
<h3>油市　柏油忽跌忽漲之原因</h3>
<p>柏油銷塲、夏令本爲落令、惟自皂廠勃興、其原料泰半取諸柏油、故柏油用度製皂反多於製燭、在夏令燭淘停製時期、正　廠　用之時、且皂用旣較燭用爲大、則夏令銷路恒校容冬爲旺、所以近十餘年、終年似無落令時代、盈虛調各得共宜、乃最近三四年形勢驟變、製皂原盡取用椰子油牛油等國外貨品、而柏油製皂、巳成强弩之末、故每屆夏令、依然恢復從前之落令時代矣、本年夏銷當不能例外、百入夏以來銷塲寂靜、所幸各處存底單薄、故銷路縱淸、尙不致暴跌、上週漢市因久無交易、重荊跌開十二兩至十一兩七八錢、麻城油跌至十一兩四錢、無如跌價後、漢市各帮、認爲時機已至、均欲採辦、但漢市之所以跌價者，原囚久無交易所致、係欲借此活動市而、並非存貨雄厚、旋見各帮均有辦意、市而復又轉動、據昨漢函所詳、麻城十二兩尙無多數可辦、可見上週之跌價、非正式市面、以致兔起　落、轉　即變、總之銷路雖淸、存貨甚稀、故似尚疲弱、一見交易、易起漲風、本埠行家存積極薄、惟因銷淸、尙不注意進貨、此次見漢市價格稍跌、亦曾函電採辦、繼見復漲、亦巳停止、市上售盤仍參差不一、大約重荊每砠極低在二十元左右云、</p>

<h3>蘇女師學潮感言</h3>
<p>— 柳虞</p>
<p>近幾年來，全國學生在「整頓學風」及「忍辱負重，埋頭苦讀」的驅策之下，早巳變成一羣羣馴善的羔羊；他們不是埋頭窗下，孜孜於學分文憑；就是醉生夢死，戀戀於眼前的享樂，「五四」「五卅」時代的活躍精神，至今早巳烟消雲散，在這樣沈寂的空氣之中，蘇州女師的學生，居然會在五月十四日發生「驅長風潮」，這確是値得注意的一件大事。</p>
<p>這次風潮發生的主因，據七月九日報戰江蘇教廳報告，是「因訓育主任孫其敏去留問題，教員出而干涉，學生勒迫簽約」；並且孫其敏對於此次風潮，顯有縱容指使情節」。上述原因是否確實，當然不容妄下判斷；不過單單根據上項記戰，巳經不得不引起我們的疑惑。訓育主任孫其敏旣然「行爲不正，思想不純」爲何竟能「指使」全校學生出而挽留，甚至因此發生「勒迫簽約」的「越規行爲」！另一方面，所謂「長校八年，成績卓著」的陳校長，爲何反受全體學生驅逐？就是說學生思想幼稚，容易受人利用；但在「成績卓著」的中等學校，受了五六年的教育，而且不久也將爲人師表，對此切身問題，總不致於完全沒有辨別能力吧！</p>
<p>退一步講，即使風潮起因，確由教員「縱容指使」，則其責任也不能够推給學生；因爲教員的聘請，其權完全屬於校長，據聞此次被撇職的訓育主任，在校執教，巳有六年之久，素受校長　崇，且會博得教育廳的傳令嘉獎過的。倘使果眞「行爲不正，思想不純」；校長就應首先負責，教廳一面承認校長「用人失察」，一面又以「長校八年，成績卓著」八字替她輕輕掩飾過去，可是所謂「成績卓著」，又無事實證明；我們所看到的，只是引起全校學生驅逐這樣一點小小「成績」而巳，這樣看來，所謂「長校八年，成績卓著」實和「行爲不正，思想不純」，同樣是令人難解的語句。</p>
<p>最後講到學生方面，此次風潮結束，開除學生竟有十人之多，恐非始料所及。但在稍具社會科學知識的人看來，這是不容駭怪的事情。天下本沒有什麼絕對的是非；在某一立塲上的「正當要求」，到了另一塲所也就會變成『越規行動」。反過來講，在學生方面看來那種『羔羊」式的教育，同樣也有牠的社會基礎，假使以爲這是幾個人的事情，可靠幾個人的去留獲得解决：那末她們必然會受到最嚴重的教訓。</p>
<p>婦女問題講座</p>
<h3>第三節　自由戀愛與結婚</h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>產業革命，在戀愛及結婚關係上也引起了重大的變化。</p>
<p>我們知道，在奴隸經濟時代有所謂買婚，這是　家畜，榖物及現錢等代價去收買新娘的婚姻。又在封建時代有所謂盲婚，這是不管婚姻當事者的願意與否，只要以家長及家族經濟的利益爲前提而强制說合的婚姻，也就是中國的一切『父母之命，媒妁之言」的婚姻。可是，到了資本主義社會，那種結婚形態已經不能適合於資本家的社會組織，遂把牠揚棄而創造出新的結婚關係來，這即所謂神聖的自由戀愛和結婚契約。</p>
<p>當工商市民新登歷史舞台的時候，他們的確宣誓了結婚的自由，承認婚姻當事者自行選擇其對偶的權利，更贊揚以兩性間的眞正的同意和相互的性愛爲基礎的結合。可是，這僅僅不過是市民社會的自由主義的反映而已。實際上所謂「自由」戀愛在複雜的利己主義的經濟關係之下，必然成爲金錢的殍虜。詳細點講，在有產者社會，所謂自由戀愛，縱使其動機如何的純潔與眞摯，結果不能不受金錢關係的限制。幾年前在上海轟動一時的黃慧如和陸根榮的主僕戀愛，結局也超不出道個原則。何况在這「神聖」的財產私有制支配着的社會，許多存心不良的人們，還把戀愛當作獵取財產的投機手段呢！</p>
<p>有產者社會是以商業交易的結婚契約來替代了從來的買婚和官婚制度。「結婚當事者們便成了以「同等」的資格實行交易的契約者。這當事者們相互成為買主和被賣者。」他們當中，一方是以金錢來保證愛情，他方是以愛情來換取金錢。所謂結婚完全從屬於資本主義的商品市塲的法則。資本主義是把婦女從買婚及盲婚制度中「解放」出來，使她成爲不得不販賣愛情的「商婦。」現代英國小說家阿諾爾得，關於他的小說「像」中的女主人公，這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「她爲了得到有財產的男人，受着特殊的訓練，她終於成功了。就是嫁給了雪爾公爵。這就是等於嫁給了在英格蘭的二萬英畝的土地，在蘇格蘭的四千英畝土地，在彼加特里的一楝房產，在各州市鎭的七梀房產，一艘蒸氣快船，還有五十萬磅的中部英格蘭的鐵道股票等等。」</p>
<p>這就是對於資本主義社會的幾千萬男女老少而說的話，也就是有產者社會的結婚的公式。換言之，差不多每個人都要嫁給炭坑，煤油，百貨店等等的主人，都要和銀行存欵，金銀寳石，鋼鐵工塲等老闆結婚</p>
<p>關於有產者社會的結婚，倍倍雨說得眞好！他說：「金錢結婚是達到高等社會生活的最安全而容易的手段！一方爲着愈多愈好的金錢慾望，他方爲着爵位，稱號及身分的憧憬，在上層社會階級中，以這種方法相互尋找滿意的對象。於是婚姻成爲交易，這是一種因習的結合，兩個人表示尊敬，骨子裏個人有個人的主意。」</p>
<p>實際上不單女人追求有錢的男人，同時男人也尋覓有財產的女子。就是說那些希望獲得財富的人們以及有升官希望而窮於運動費的官吏們都　求有錢有勢的娘兒，希望和妻子同時得到財產，特別在婦女獲得財產承繼權以後，此種傾向更爲顯著。這不是結婚的賣淫化而是什麼喲！</p>
<p>當然，在資本主義社會諸條件之下，沒有經濟的獨立的婦女，要作父或夫的永遠的寄生生活的時候，這種賣淫化是不可免的事情。關於此點，我們在勞動婦女們中可以看到很明顯的反證。一位工人的女兒很早就獲得經濟的獨立。同時她是從家庭中獲得獨立。這種女子是以自己的力量决定自己的命運，依照自己個人的意志解决結婚問題。</p>
<p>婦女能够全靠自己的力量生活的時候，她的戀愛感情，不至爲金錢的打算所染汚，而以很自然的純眞的形態表現出來。婦女的經濟的獨立及於她的戀愛上可實貴的影響，是速支配層的社會學者也無法否定。「家庭的崩壞」的著者葉爾乃斯特，暮列爾是如下的說明勞動婦女的結婚關係。</p>
<p>「倘若婦女能够用自己的勞動力獲得以前靠結婚手段而得到的生活資料及一定的社會地位，那末，依結婚而要保證自己生活的婦女的努力，只不過有僅少的意義而巳。因爲她除了和性生活有直接關係者外，美不多一切的願望不單在結婚中滿足，而且在結婚外也可以滿足的原故。因此，她是把結婚看作戀愛及情慾的實現。」（參照家族及結婚社會學）</p>
<p>最後在這兒，我們須得明瞭有錢人的婦女和勞動婦女在戀愛結婚關係上有着截然不同的態度與實踐！</p>
<h3>婦女問題的檢答</h3>
<p>— 王孝英</p>
<p>因了我的一對信，竟引起了社會上如許人們的注意，羣起而來精誠地探討婦女運動的多方面的問題，由此一面可以證明婦女運動在現階段的社會實有其存在的意義和任務，另一面我除了對於此次參加討論的諸先生表示十二分的敬佩與感謝外，同時我認爲實有再來說幾句話的必要。</p>
<p>婦女園地巳出了七十二期，其內容如何，自有客觀的事實去判斷，但自本年度的三八節以後，我們却不能不承認這次的探討實爲其最大的有價値的收穫，——這一收穫，在婦女運動的過程中，確乎値得使人注意和深思的，此次我之所以寫那封信的動機，爲了是要糾正釋因先生的所謂：「爲什麼婦女運動要單獨成一個名詞？儼然有他獨立可做的事業，」以及「女　運動，以權字引人於爭奪」這兩點意義而發，誠然，誰都不能否認婦女問題與一社會間題有　極大的關聯，換句話說：婦女問題萬不能離開了整個的社會問題而得獨自解决。在前年暑期，上海八仙橋膏年會舉辦了一個社會問題講座，我是其中的主講人之一，所講的題目是：「社會問題與婦女問題」，當時我將這講題的意義發揮頗詳，我從未狹意的將婦女運動離開了整個的社會問題而專以男性爲其對象的，總之我相信婦女問題中實含有許多複雜的社會問題在。</p>
<p>現在我要切　地對於羅瓊，林庚白，徐則驤，……諸先生所發表的文章來一個簡略的回答，——其實大部分是自白：</p>
<p>（一）關於羅瓊先生在婦女園地第七十期所發表的。。「中國婦女運動的檢討，兼論王孝英先生寄給婦女靑年主筆釋因」一文所說的那許多極有意義的理論，大多是我過去曾經說過的，尤以前年暑期在靑年會演講「社會問題與婦女問題」時，更將此意加以詳細的分討，而此次爲了要單純地糾正釋因先生的兩點悮解的原故，致未提起，今得羅先生特別的補充說明，我是以最大的熱忱來感謝他的好意。</p>
<p>（二）關於林先生在婦女園地第七十一期所發表的：「不算批判的批判」一文說：「婦女運動的使命，並不是以兩性鬥爭爲終極的目的，現代的婦女運動，該有其重要的意義，應以整個的社會制度爲對象。」在今日次殖民地的中國的現實的社會情况下，外受資本主義的侵略，內受封建思想的壓制，在這般畸形而矛盾的動態中，的確，不獨是婦女運動的問題，即其他一切的問題，要想得着解决或改進，决不是斤於某一問題的平面，而忽略了多方面的立體所能收其實效，因爲局部的運動，不是根本解决的最妥善的方針，所謂「頭痛治頭，脚痛治脚，」的方法巳不適用於今日了。林先生的大概的意義，與羅先生頗有相同之點：即婦女問題决不能離開整個的社會問題而單獨可以得着解决，這一觀點我是完全贊同的，至於林先生說我是一個比較和政府接近的女性，竟能保留着五四時代的勇氣，反抗最近的婦女的復古運動，很値得驚嘆！其實站在婦女運動的氛圍中的人們，誰都應該有這一貫的精神和態度，决不是標榜着婦女運動之名，而謀一己之幸福，我們對於那些掛羊頭賣狗肉的婦女運動者，不徒要揭穿他的陰謀，更進一步羣起而攻之，暴露他的醜態！有人說我十餘年來參加婦女運動的結果，只是個人得着了成功；然而事實果眞如此嗎？不，决不，說這般話的人，許是悮解了我的爲人，或錯認了事　的本身，至少我敢說：自力行婦女運動以來，從沒有出賣過自己的靈魂與良心，無時無地不以整個的社會與婦女爲前提，所謂「犧牲小我，盡我天職」而已。</p>
<p>（三）關於徐先生六月九日在晨報星期時論發表的：「婦女運動之矛盾」，文中所云，可說完全是針對着現代的摩登女性而發，他痛惜着摩登婦女：「……自卸其一切家庭社會之實任，以一完全不生產之身，追求高度西化之生活，出則　服濃裝，姿情歌舞，入則　指氣使，僕傭滿前，千百工農血汗結晶之金錢，不辭付作胭脂香水之代價，……」然而這只可謂是繁　虛華的都市尤其是上海的太太，小姐，少奶奶所特有的形態，要知目前的中國尙有絕大多數的女性，在社會　層的壓榨下掙扎着，奮鬥着，這些被壓迫的婦女，她們日常的生活是「刻苦耐勞，節食儉用」，她們絕對沒有卸去其對於家庭社會一切應盡的責任，而染有現時摩登女性的惡習氣！徐先生今以特殊的形象，而抺煞女性的一般的事實，這顯然對於婦女的着眼，是　於社會的某一觀點，而未能將整個社會的婦女的情態，加以精密的透視，以致只看到了現代中國少數的　奢華侈的摩登女性，而忽略了大多數的勤樸眞誠的非摩登女性，在這「婦女回家庭去」！「賢妻良母」！的高呼的聲浪中，我們還忍因　而廢食嗎？不過徐先生仁者的用心，自有値得注意之點，至少他的感嘆可給予現時的專事消費不能生產的摩登女性一個强有力的當頭棒喝！</p>
<p>至於高鴻　先生的：「讀寄給婦女靑年主筆釋因後」一文，許是他因了對於事實上的見解有所不同，致所發的言論亦因之而異，雖然七中不無若干可取之點，但主觀的偏見要亦在所難免，這正如婦女園地的編者所謂：「仁者見仁，智者見智」是也。因了篇幅的關係，此地不再多事嘮叨。</p>
<p>最後我希望從事婦女運動的人們，注重實地苦幹，以大無畏的精神，剛果的毅力。站在解决整個社會問題的中心去謀現階段的婦女的解放！</p>

<h3>回家</h3>
<p>— 蘇虹</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>修珍，三年前離開鄉村到都市。現在是由都市中剛回來，幾年不見了的鄉村，重新展開在她的面前：山，依舊和從前一樣地兀立着；河，依舊和從前一樣地灣曲的橫臥着；田野也是依舊，就是她此刻在走着的小道，也和從前並無兩樣地伸着。但是她總覺得與先前有一種不同的感覺，她深深地感到凄凉，一種不安的壓力在威迫着她。仔細地四面瞧瞧，總究變了：山上，沒有如從前那樣茂盛的樹林；河水，沒有如從前那樣地深澈；田野中，沒有如從前那樣地種着麥子和豆苗；小道邊，泥塊崩潰了不少；石板，也有的破碎歪斜了。她踉蹌地走來，遠望那河埠頭有一個淘米的婦人，認不淸是鄰居還是嬸嬸，待她走近河埠來，在一切的動作上，她看出那婦人就是她的嫂嫂，不過的確也和景物一樣地變樣，從前嫂嫂是胖胖的，全身都是肉，臉長圓的，兩頰紅紅的，現在她却變了瘦子，頰上的肉不知給誰揑了去，鼻子高起一根骨，尖尖的露着。</p>
<p>修珍上前一步去，稱呼了一聲。在忙着淘米的嫂嫂，被這一稱呼，耳朶受了特異的刺戟，生疏了幾年的聲音，怎麼會突然現出在她的後面，她猛抬起頭來，盛米籮幾乎快將反轉。她注視着修珍，以爲是陌人。自然修珍如今也換了樣，從前見活潑靑春的小姑娘，現在是瘦黃沒精沒彩的，如枯瓜的一條。嫂嫂呆了半天，才有點記憶到：</p>
<p>噢……是妹妹！唉喲，你回來啦！婆婆眞正卦念你哩！連忙收拾起所洗淘的東西，同修珍並着肩走，一邊又接着說，聲音却稍微低了些：</p>
<p>——你見到你哥哥沒有？</p>
<p>——呵！哥哥在上海？可是我沒有看見，他什麼時候去的？</p>
<p>——一年多了，去了一直的沒有消息，連信也不寄一封回來。嫂嫂眼眶中有點水晶晶</p>
<p>嫂嫂默默地走近家來。雞在廊下走，雞糞滿地。黃狗狂吠着。隔璧王少奶奶同了丫頭阿菊在做銀錠，聽得犬狂呌，王少奶奶連聲說：</p>
<p>——一定是討飯的，阿菊！快關門！——乒的一聲關門響</p>
<p>修珍的母親在自己門前坐着念佛。也許覺得「南無阿彌陀佛」六個字念起來太麻煩，她常常簡單的念：陀佛，陀佛，阿彌陀佛。她此刻聽得狗呌，爲了攙進幾句話，愈加念得簡略了：</p>
<p>——佛，佛，佛，……狗又呌着，一定是討飯的。這幾年來，討飯的眞多。陀佛，陀佛，阿彌陀佛……。」</p>
<p>修珍見了她的母親。她的母親方方的臉，寬闊的身段，依舊如故，不過顯然老得多了，第一是眼光暗淡了不少，似乎有一隻已經變了瞎。</p>
<p>——媽媽！」修珍呌。</p>
<p>——啊！是誰？……我的修珍？」母親趕忙站起，念珠隨身帶起走。「阿彌陀佛，我的肉，你回來啦！」</p>
<p>母親喜歡得淌着眼淚，她不曉得說些什麼好，只是顫顫地動着嘴唇。但是她心酸着，疼愛着，她看着女兒黃瘦的臉，單薄的衣服，又加上一陣難過，明知道女兒這樣的一個塲面回來，落拓的身面，空空的手，顯然是在上海不得意。她馬上把女兒引進房裏，把左眼簾揭起，以便看淸楚些：</p>
<p>——呵！要弄得這樣瘦！」急忙把念珠包好，放進抽屜裏，順手拿出一塊豆腐乾。「你吃這塊豆腐乾，前幾天我巷王家少奶奶念佛，她把豆腐乾給我當點心。現在，眞是什麼都收小，從前念佛點心總是一　麵，……」</p>
<p>修珍實在不想吃這塊發了霉的豆腐乾，她想要吃好味道的東西，可是她接下了，她知道這塊東西是嚼不出什麼好味道來的，但是這是母親送她的，難得的久別重逢的見面禮，又加她肚子着實有些餓，也就塞進嘴裏，不管蟑螂氣怎麼重，她慢慢地嚼着，幾乎要嘔吐。母親繼續在摸索着，她想再弄點什麼東西給她的「寳貝」——如餓蝨一樣的女兒。（未完）</p>

<h3>浪童救濟問題平議</h3>
<p>— 柳辛</p>
<p>自本年從八月一日起定爲兒童年後，風聲所播，社會人士對兒童幸福事宜已引起相當注意，實爲近來可喜現象之一。同時一般人的目光也不僅僅專注於富家兒童之如何教養，且進而着眼於貧兒浪童之如何救濟，這尤爲着先鞭之見地。</p>
<p>七月七日，有王懋和先生的「救濟流浪之兒童」一文刋於晨報星期評論，主張實行貧兒年金制爲普救浪童的唯一辦法，翌日又刋有弗公先生「關於浪童救濟問題之商榷」，站在客觀的立塲詳析廠院救濟制及貧兒年金制之得失，筆酣墨舞，披剝透剔，誠兒童年開幕禮前之一聲喝道大砲也。</p>
<p>尋釋王懋和先生與弗公先生的文章，對於浪童有救濟之必要，皆已毫無疑義，論爭焦點，無非是救濟浪童的方法問題。懋和先生之所以以貧兒年金制爲有利者理由有三：『（一）以年金予貧兒，則貧兒可在家庭中受救助，母須入牢獄式之廠院；（二）改廠院救助爲年金救助，旣可省去薪水等項之開支，兒童所得實惠自較多；（三）可行家庭委託制，以年金付與受委託之家庭，使其教養無家可歸之孤兒，將來孤兒成學成年之際，必可得受托家庭之援助而成家成業。』這里可討論者有三：一，家庭委托制是否可能的問題：二，年金救助是否較廠院制經濟的問題；三，家庭委托制是否較廠院制合理的問題。試就鄙見伸述如下：</p>
<p>（一）貧兒與浪童，事理上無論如何總是兩種不同的種類：蓋貧兒是因貧而無法生活無力教養，雖不久也許也不免淪爲浪童，然而究竟還沒有到淪爲浪童的地步，猶未染有一般浪童所沾染的流浪習慣，設及時救濟之，使得以生活得受教育，方法必與平常兒童無異，所以救濟貧兒採用年金救助制，未爲不可（若根本說來，如單救濟某一貧窮家庭中之某（二）兒童，而此某一家庭中之其他諸人仍無法生存時，則此年金救助是否能全部救助於此某一兒童，固尙屬疑問，惟此處談龍說龍，談虎說虎，姑不去再行牽涉，以免問題擴大），至若浪童，則或爲無父無母之孤兒，或爲無產工農家庭之貧兒，或因沾染不良習慣或嗜好（如偷竊吸烟），而淪落在街頭的沒有家庭的兒童，他們不僅貧，而且沒有家，他們不僅浪，並且有不良的壞習慣。明乎此，然後我們可以進而談怎樣救濟的問題。</p>
<p>主張家庭委托制的懋和先生，他欲將貧兒與浪童一槪適用，實在是味於事理的見解。譬如舉一個例吧，中國向來重宗族觀念，乏嗣的父母常領養貧兒爲螟　，這雖不負「家庭委托」之名，其實這也與貧兒委托之意義相同，然而乏嗣的父母要領養的是貧兒，卽願受委托的對象是貧兒，若在街頭巷尾躅　着的浪童，則往往爲乏嗣父母所不願領養。試問乏嗣的父母尙多不願領養沾有不良習慣的浪童，則共他誰願養一流浪兒童使與自家的兒女爲伍？——這是事實的可能問題，决不是理論的問題，這是中國的問題，决不是侈談模仿的問題。這樣說來，可知採用家庭委托制救濟浪童，其「可能」性實很薄弱。</p>
<p>（二）其次，年金救助是否較廠院制「經濟」？關於年金救助費之來源如何，姑且置之不論，但分散救助必致分散貸欵，結果怕只能養活貧兒，充其量也只能做到教育貧兒這一步，可謂純消費的。至於設立廠院之經費，粗粗看來似乎與年金救助費一樣，也是消費的，並且如晨報記者所說更有『無不支薪之職員』的消耗，然而這僅屬短視之見。年金救助制雖或有肯盡義務之調查員與監督員，但教養是散漫的，不集中的；若廠院制，則雖有少數職員工薪之支出，但可以有一定的計割去實施，如蘇俄革命後之浪童救濟也是强制捕捉所有浪童納之於廠院中，起初當然不免難於就範，管理頗有困難，但假以步驟，漸次訓誨，這一批街頭的小浪人，竟都能做工，都能生產（因爲他們並不是低能，實綠未受教育），以後就成爲了工廠中的好工人，國家的好建設人才，這是一個好教訓。我們不値得只把救濟浪童作爲消費行動，而我們應集中許多不用的勞力用之於生產和建設。因爲年金救助是純消費的，而廠院制則是生產的，——雖未必能做到廠院自給，也不會較年金救助更浪費，———所以年金救助實在並不比廠院制在經濟上有若何便宜。</p>
<p>（三）假定我們承認家庭委托制有通行的可能，但試問中國多數家庭是怎樣的家庭？大多數父母都不懂得什麼叫教養，更不懂得什麼叫合理的教養，中國有多少茁壯的有希望的小國民，被戕賊於這般無知的父母之手，被抹殺於不懂合理教養方法的愚味之下！如果我們將浪童去委托援手於不懂合理方法教養兒童的家庭中，自無異於「問道於盲」了！這樣，救濟浪童也仍然是爲戕賊浪童的嘴臉上加了一個面具而已。假定我們相信晨報記者所說的話：美國厲行家庭委托制而被委托者能接受委托，中國家庭也必能如美國一樣肯接受委托，但肯接受委托而不會去合理教養，那又有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>更進一步言，這一般强制受委托的家庭是否都能眞心誠意負責救助受委托的浪童呢？這恐怕是未可必的事罷？雖然有盡義務的且負責的監督人員在那裏查察，然又何必要將浪童作爲負責與否的試金石呢？在這一種比較下，可見欲求少數廠院職員負責任，容易，欲全部受委托家庭負責，較難。</p>
<p>因之，家庭委托制在合理的教養上實遠遜於廠院制多多了。</p>
<p>綜上所述，採用家庭委托制救濟浪童的可能性旣很薄弱，年金救助制又並不比廠院制在經濟上有若何便宜，至於合理的教養，家庭委托制更遠遜於廠院制，懋和先生雖欲抄捷徑，圖便宜，共如事實往往會反乎理想何。</p>
<p>民間傳說</p>
<h3>龍珠</h3>
<p>— 吳玲女士</p>
<p>太陽從睡夢中醒來，慢慢的把頭探出海面，牠的血紅的光芒立刻照遍了大地，又慢慢的乘着紅色的快馬一直向天空飛去。四射的光芒透過了綠油色平靜的大海，像萬隻尖針似的穿進稠密的森林，照到雄偉的高山，又一直射到了高山底下一排簡陋的古老的茅屋。</p>
<p>光明喚醒了一切：和風輕輕的吹了過來，大樹的綠葉互相擺了幾擺；鳥兒從窠中探出頭來，看見太陽的笑臉，忙喚了　鳥們唱起歌兒；草地上的</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>野花也都仲直了腰幹，嬌媚的吐出淸香來。</p>
<p>茅屋的門呀的一聲開了，走出一個婦人。她走到茅屋旁，把　籠的門兒打開，小　一偭個咕嚕咕嚕的走出來，吃着婦人撒下來的小米。</p>
<p>「明兒！起來呵，不早了。」婦人呌着。</p>
<p>「起來啦！媽媽！」十五六歲的明兒答應着。</p>
<p>早年死了丈夫的她，辛苦的把明兒養大，她每天靠着紡紗織布或給別人縫縫衣服過活。明兒長到八九歲時就開始上山　草，每天中午回來吃過飯後，把牠拿到市上去賣，晚上換了一些米回來；冬天呢，就在山上伐樹斫木，一捆捆的賣給大戶人家。母子倆就這樣互相帮助的快快樂樂的生活着。</p>
<p>照例，忚們起得很早。吃過了飯，明兒拿？蠱刀，　　繩子，到山上開始工作去，母親也織起布來。</p>
<p>向媽媽告別出來的明兒，一路走，一路唱着山歌。他時常停住脚步，聽聽小鳥悅耳的歌聲，或是　下腰來採一朶美麗的野花，有時遇見一個奇怪的飛禽和小蟲，他一定要把牠捉住，細細的觀察着。穿過了森林，走過了小河，一座壯麗的高山現在他的眼前，山上長着一層碧玉似的靑草，踏着牠，心頭似乎軟綿綿的。熱練的爬上去，强健的身體伴着愉快的脚步，一會兒就到了山頂。山上靑草有的巳經割完還沒有長出來，有的又短短的舖在地上，他最後找到有一尺多高的靑草地。歡喜極了的他，趕緊開始工作起來。雖然是小小的身體，却是又有氣力又敏捷的，不到一刻兒工夫，在他的旁　就空了一大塊。陽廣　　　的空隙中偷偷的看着他，鳥兒唱着歌兒讚美他，風兒輕輕的吻着他。</p>
<p>第二天，他又照常的到山上去。當他無意中走到昨天所刈過的那塊草地時，立刻發現一種可驚異的現象，想不到一夜的工夫竟又長出一尺多高的靑草，別的地方照樣的還是沒長出來。他非常高興的刈着草，還沒有到中午他巳經得到不能再多的時候，就回家去了。他看看時間還早，就一直到市上去。</p>
<p>母親正在河邊洗米，遠遠的看見明兒走來，非常奇怪他沒有革負在他的背上，但是細看却有一個紙袋兒拿在手裏，那是明兒每天要到晚上才拿回來的米，母親是多麼的歡喜呀</p>
<p>一連幾天他都到那塊草地上去，每天都有新的草長出來。他每天很早的把草賣完，換了米回來，下午又往山上刈草，完了又賣去。</p>
<p>好奇心驅使着他，當他今天到那塊草地去的時候。「一定有什麼緣故吧？」他想。於是他開始向四周尋找奇怪的東西，可是沒有！也許旁邊那棵老樹有精怪吧，跑過去一看，也沒有什麼。他東看看，西瞧瞧，忙亂了一會，結果却仍然我不出所以然來！</p>
<p>第二天，他想起了也許草地裏有什麼東西，於是他帶了一柄鏟子去。割完草，他用鏟子掘下地去，越掘越深，可是也沒有什麼。他的好奇心和堅决的意志使他繼續地掘下去，最後終於發現了一塊硬的東西。他拿起來一看，原來是一粒小珠子，放着亮晶晶的光，非常美麗。回到家裏，他向母親說一定是寳貴的東西，母親却說不過是一棵好看的珠子吧了，那有什麼實貝！吃過晚飯後，天已經暗了下來，這是村人睡覺的時候了，因爲他們是點不起燈的。母子倆非常奇怪，到這時候爲什麼還不天黑，屋子裏亮得和太陽照着一樣。明兒到屋外去一看，却見滿天的星兒掛在天空中了，那是多麼的奇怪呵！他們最後發現了原因是在桌上的珠子發着光芒照　着。</p>
<p>寳物呵！母親知道是一種寳物了。他們怕村人知道，於是開始找地方把牠藏起來。無論什麼地方，只要有一個小孔，牠的光還是照樣的射了出來。明兒把他的衣服拿出來包着牠，可是不行，亮光還是一直透了出來。最後，他們把牠放在僅僅剩一點米的　裏，把蓋子蓋好，這才放心地快樂地去睡了。</p>
<p>早上母親起來預備煮飯，剛拿開米櫃的蓋，即有許多米粒嘩啦嘩啦的滾了出來，一個大櫃子裝滿了白白的米，再也裝不下了！驚異，歡喜，充滿了母親的心中，她一面喊醒明兒，一面快樂的流下淚來！</p>
<p>「明兒！這是好寳貝呵，不要告訴别人！」</p>
<p>但是，明兒終究是個小孩子，而且生性直爽誠實，沒過幾天就告訴别人。於是一傳十，十傳百，全村人都知道了！</p>
<p>「明兒，你的寳貝是什麼樣兒的呵？」</p>
<p>「給我們看看吧！」</p>
<p>從此以後每天都有許多人來圍着他。</p>
<p>最後他因爲拗他們不過，終於把珠子拿出來給他們看！</p>
<p>「呀！多亮呵！」</p>
<p>「眞是好寳貝！』</p>
<p>「要是我的就好了！」</p>
<p>大家你擠過來，他衝過去，團團的把明兒圍在中心，弄得他連氣都喘不過來。漸漸的，騷擾起來了，許多不懷好意的竟想奪他的珠子。他連忙就跑，後面有許多人追着，最後被他們追上，他心裏一急，就把珠子放在口裏嚥了下去。</p>
<p>人，是散去了！</p>
<p>他沒奈何的回到家裏，母親埋怨　他，他也不響。一會兒他覺得口渴得狠，母親給他盛了碗水，他便饑餓似的嚥下去。然而，還是渴得要命，索性到水缸去喝，不一會兒又喝完了！沒法想，只好自己拿了水桶到河裏去打水。到了河邊，汲了水在桶裏，走到半路上又喝完了。最後爬在河邊就喝，無窮無盡的喝。漸漸的似乎頭上有點痛，摸一摸，不得了，頭上長出兩隻角來，向河中一照，巳經不是自己本來的面目了。他開始明白了自己的遭遇，心中悲哀了起來，但是還一是不由己的喝。終於衣服退下，遍體的鱗長上了。想哭已經哭不出來，想起親愛的母親，想大聲的喊，但是聲音已經發不出來！</p>
<p>太陽慢慢的西落下去，很沉悶的似乎已知道有這一幕悲劇的到來，鳥兒的歌也改換了凄凉的音調，怒風也開始了呼號。</p>
<p>母親多時不見明兒轉來，便到外面去找他。待走到河邊時，只見他的衣服堆在岸上，明兒已經變成了一條小龍在水裏向她點頭。</p>
<p>「明兒！我的明兒呵！」母親哭着，呌着，然而有什麽用呢？</p>
<p>小龍逐漸的長大，戀戀不捨的流着眼淚，一直望着母親點着頭兒，不能做主的順着河流游去。一邊游一邊回頭看看母親，牠回一次頭，一股巨大的浪便漲了起來，慘痛的望了二十四次母親，一直起了二十四次大浪，後來就漸漸的望不見了！</p>
<p>母親眼前似乎覺得萬物都轉動顚倒了起來，一陣昏花，便倒了下去。</p>
<p>各業調査</p>
<h3>四川的夏布業</h3>
<p>— 嘉</p>
<p>夏布—一種蔴織物，在四川名叫「蔴布」。</p>
<p>四川蔴布顏色白凈，雖至破舊亦不「翻黃」，因此銷售的數量遠較他省所產的爲大，同時價値亦較昂貴。牠銷售的地方，除了國內的雲南，貴州，上海，漢口等地外，國外的朝鮮也是主要的市塲。</p>
<p>四川產蔴布的地方，也有好幾個縣份，如江津·隆昌·榮昌·安樂·樂至等縣都是，然而這中間要算安樂產量最多，而隆昌蔴布最負盛名，這一則由於隆昌本地所產的品質較好，同時隆昌又是蔴布出川的歸宗地方。所以說到四川的蔴布，總以隆昌爲代表，就是販賣的招牌也是掛着「隆昌」二字。</p>
<p>蔴布的用途，可分兩種：卽（一）衣料，（二）蚊帳。前者質料精細，製造的丰續也很複雜，所以價値方面有超過蚊帳蔴布十倍以上的。同時不但二者間價値有分別，就是每一種裏面，也可分七八種等級。就衣料蔴布來說：頭一等的每疋可賣到五十餘元（每疋約可縫兩件男長衫），最低等的約値三元，四元。至於蚊帳蔴布，每疋計長四丈八尺，價錢自三十餘元至二元餘不等。這自然是就目前上海的市價來說，有時因爲銷路的不同，而市價也隨着變更。</p>
<p>隆昌的蔴布，因爲銷售的市塲較多，所以南方各大城市如上海，廣州，漢口，香港，昆明，貴陽，都有設莊批發。每年開莊的時期，總在暮春以後，直到秋中纔得收莊。因爲暮春後新蔴布剛上市，到了秋凉，蔴布也失掉牠的作用和意義了。</p>
<p>四川的蔴布商人，在上海設莊的叫「隆昌帮」，每年約可做百萬元的生意，坐莊經營的人叫「莊客」，他們代表當地的商店到上海來賣貨！蔴布從四川寄郵，莊客收到這項貨物攙批發與別處的莊客。不過賣者與買者間很少直接交涉，全由「行客」媒介，一切銀錢手續也全由「行客」經手的。</p>
<p>前幾年蔴布很能暢銷，原因是朝鮮方面到上海來販運的人很多，所以四川的蔴布商人（所謂「隆昌帮」）大都吃得肥肥胖胖。可是近兩三年來，銷路逐漸閉塞，價値也逐漸低落。尤其是今年，市塲更顯得疲憊；目前正是赤日炎炎的暑一天，論理該是蔴布大出風頭的時侯，可是市價仍不能抬頭，而且還難以賣得股手，所謂「隆昌帮」，大都坐在商棧里長吁短嘆，當他們眼見着生意虧本，沒有挽救辦　的時侯！</p>
<p>四川蔴布運到上海來，全是蚊帳料子，因爲蚊帳是熱帶及溫帶地方所必需製備的，而且用蔴布做蚊帳，空氣比較流通，所以銷路較多。至於衣料，一則因爲成本太大，同時外邊穿蔴布的人又很少，故一般商人都不敢採辦這項貨物。從前一疋蚊帳蔴布，除了一切成本，還可賺到四分之一的利息，但目前却反而弄得虧本了！當這市面蕭條，百業凋敝的時侯，夏布業不隨着潮流沒落，又將走向那兒去呢？</p>
<p>蔴布的原料，名叫苧蔴，每年可以收割三次！春，夏，秋三季。種蔴的人家，把蔴莖弄回家里，由婦人，孩子抽去莖桿，把皮子浸在淸凉的水缸裏，經過相當的時候，纔從水裏撈出來讓牠風乾，以後就扱成蔴絲，再由蔴絲扱成蔴綫，這　綫由織布的人家或工廠收買了去，織成大批的布疋，然後由蔴布商收集這些布疋運往各處銷售。在隆昌有很多收買蔴布的商號，據調查，每天大槪可有三萬元的交易。在這樣一個小小的城市中，有這麼大的單頭生意，可以算是特有的現象了—、</p>
<p>苧蔴的皮子本是靑色，待扱成了蔴綫，因爲經過水浸和風乾，便現微黃色。所以織成布疋後，還要經過麻煩的「漂白」手續：每天早上還沒有陽光的時侯，便把蔴布展放在草坪里，讓牠吸收露水，太陽出來把牠晒乾後，又洒上淸凈的河水，每天都「如法炮製」，使布的顏色逐漸變白。這樣過了半個月，便成爲有光澤的美麗的蔴布了。</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>不過這是就蚊帳蔴布來說，如果是作衣料用的，那就更麻煩：在扱蔴時，就需要細膩的手工，搓成堅固的細緻的蔴綫，織造的時候自然根頭要多，而且還要根條均勻，所謂「不漏孔」，「不現梗」，纔叫做上等蔴布。同時織成了布，還要運到榮昌那條河里去浸。因爲蔴布經過榮昌河里的水的侵蝕，顏色特別白凈，所以附近各縣的蔴布，都要運到那兒去加以潤色。每當夏季，這條河特別熱鬧，這就是蔴布商人在改良生產了</p>
<p>上等蔴布的價値，要超過綢子好幾倍，一則由於牠本身的質地，比綢子好，同時還經過了複雜的手續。我們往往見着別人穿一件蔴布衫，覺得很尋常，那知牠却是集合許多人的心力所造成的啊！</p>
<p>科學叢話</p>
<h3>人類征服地面的成績</h3>
<p>— 育民</p>
<p>發現和征服我們自己所居的地球，這也不是一件很容易的事，因爲它有着許多自然的障碍和困難，阻止人類去認識它。這種困難，最顯著的當然是大海大洋的水的面積過於寬庶，很難飛渡；是睦地內部的高山沙漠的阻碍；是過於酷　的氣候的限制等等。在人類幾十萬年的努力中，現在雖然巳把前兩種顯著的困難克服了，可是後一種困難到如今還未完全克服，所以兩極地的探險家，至今還在冒着生命危險在那裏辛苦地工作。這些自然的困難與阻碍，是要能充分地利用自然法則的科學技術發達，才能克服的，所以這就有待於人類的生產方法和技術的進步。而就人類之發現和征服自己所處的大地的過程看來，亦是適應於生產技術的，絕不是單純的什麼好奇心冒險性的結果。沒有船舟製造的進步，你就再會冒險和好奇，也飛渡不了大海大洋，美洲新大陸的發現就成爲不可能。</p>
<p>就人類之各別地存在於地球上說，當然人類之發現地球的區域，巳經是很早很早就知道很多了。但是，如果要就一定地域的居民，對於全地球的發現和征服工作來講，那麼這種成績當然要歸之於歐洲人。所以以地球的總的認識過程說，我們以歐洲人對於它的發現和征服範園之廣表，作爲人類對地球的地理知識發展過程，亦是正當的。</p>
<p>原始的人都相信地球的陸地是一平面而有邊沿的東西，如果到了它的邊沿，就會掉下去不知死在何處，所以沒有人敢於去試探地之廣大，都只各自徘徊於自己所居的附近地域。若以西方民族爲中心而談地球的發現和征服，那麼在最古的民族中，有確切證據可考，知道他們所發現的大地面積有多少廣的，首先就得提到菲尼幾人。自然，如就世界人種的分布而言，據說中國人也來自西方，甚至美洲土人亦是在白令海峽未形成前遷徙到那邊去的，但這只是原始的人類學上的推測，而不是依據人類文化史的紀錄所能知道的。菲尼幾人雖居於地中海的極東，但他們却在歐南，非北以及西班牙半島，都有他們的征服地。當然，如像埃及北部，如像巴比倫地區，他們都會活動到了。那時他們所認識的世界，也就只有這樣大。其次是希臘時代。希臘人所知道的地域，不但是凡菲尼幾人所知道的他們都知道，而且他們在北方是達到了巴爾幹，在非洲達到了尼羅河的發源地，甚至達到了沙哈拉，他們亦偶爾探素到了黑海的邊沿和俄羅斯平原。著名的亞力山大遠征到了波斯，印度，知道了土爾基坦和中國的廣東邊境，這是比菲尼幾人所發現的地面更擴大了。前期的羅馬人所知的地域，當然是包括希臘人所知的一切的。並且他們還征服了英國，擴張至歐洲的極西部份。在非洲方面，他們佔領了現在的摩洛哥等地。據說羅馬人這時即巳與中國通過往來，如此則竟至知道了東亞的一部分。如果要總括地來說，那麼我們可以以蒲多列麥所擬想的地域來作爲古代的歐洲民族所發現的地域，作爲他們那時所認識的世界廣狹的代表。他是以地中海爲中心，西至大不列巔島，西北至斯干底拉維亞半島，北至俄羅斯平原，東至印度和中國南方的邊沿，南則達於上尼羅河和蘇丹。但在海洋上，則只達到了大西洋與印度洋的沿岸。</p>
<p>中世紀時代的西方人，他們在北方斯干底拉維亞的水手勇敢地向西方的大洋中探素之下，巳經知道了伊士蘭得和格林蘭得島，甚至達到了加拿大或美國的東邊，這算是第一次穿過了大西洋。在南方回教徒的阿拉伯人，爲了宣傳莫罕默德教，他們是穿過了菲洲的內部，並向南部的極東的諸島進發過。其西則進達於歐洲而與十字軍相衝突。這時更有威尼士城的市民馬可波尼到過中國，以此他知道日本，又於其回途中經過了新加坡。這樣，中世紀人類所知的世界，可以說西北達於格林蘭得島更及於美洲的加拿大與美國邊境，南及於菲洲之半，東方達到了日本和新加坡了。</p>
<p>文藝復興以來，地爲球形之說巳被確定，而發現新大陸和新航路的熱狂，在商業與殖民地的要求刺激之下是更加發達了。一四八六年葡萄牙人地亞士航行達到了好望角，遂由海道越菲洲而至印度，非洲的大概輪廓遂完全知曉了。一四九二年哥倫布渡大西洋發現了美洲新大陸。一五一九年葡萄牙人麥哲倫開始作環球旅行，由歐洲西行達美洲，再繞南美南端，渡麥誓倫海峽而至太平洋，並發現菲律賓。麥氏雖死當地土人之手，但其同伴則在一五二二年完成其世界旅行。在十七世紀中，南北美洲的內地，不但繼續不斷的發現，而且大半均爲葡萄牙人和西班牙人所佔領。總括文藝復興時代，地面之巳知的領域，要大過原來的三倍。</p>
<p>在十七世紀以來，歐洲各國即爲革命風潮和戰爭所牽制，這時只有荷蘭仍繼續其南菲洲的內部的探索。然而在一七八五至一七九一年間，法國人是深入到日本的北方諸島中了。一七六八至一七七一年間，英國人也發現了夏威夷羣島，澳大利亞洲，直達南冰洋。到十九世紀，最主要的開發是向着亞菲兩洲的內部發展．美洲方面的加拿大與美國，則逐漸開展至太平洋岸，澳洲方面英國人亦逐漸發現其全大陸．在菲洲中，一八六一至一八七七年英人探素得尼羅河發源諸地；一八七一至一八八五年由美國人，意大利人發現剛果大盆地；一八六一至一八七九年英人探知了南菲部情形及其諸大湖。在亞洲方面，法國人開始侵入安南，英國深入印度，所有的歐洲人都集中精力深入中國到內地。美洲和歐洲間之由北至西的航路，是挪威人在一九〇六年試行成功的，歐亞之間由北至東的通道，也就挪威人在一八七六至一八七九年發現的。北極的認識是英，美，挪威人探險的結果，特別以挪威人一八九三至一八九六年的發現，和美國人一九〇九年之達到了北極圈，最爲重要。在南極方面，說到它的發現尙只是二十世細的事，最主要的是一九〇二和一九一〇年的英國人的探險，與一九一一年挪威人達到了南極。全地球的地面，到現在巳經沒有甚麼絕五人跡達到的秘密地方了，有之，也只是南北極圈中的少數地帶，也只是帕米爾高原的最高山頂。但是，前年和去年蘇聯的探險隊在北極亦有新紀錄發現，而美國的探險隊則在南極又發現了新陸地。兩極和最高山頂，却有許多不顧生命犧牲的探險家在那裏繼續刻苦工作啊！隨着近代的生產技術的發達，以最銳利的破冰輪和飛機從水陸雙方進攻，那些秘密的地帶也是無從逃隱的。差不多地球的全面積之每一點，都巳實際地攝入了人類的眼底，人類征服自然的能力眞偉大！</p>

<h3>怎樣寫作短篇小說</h3>
<p>— 周葛</p>
<p>所謂短篇小說，其本質雖與長篇及中篇小說沒有根本上的差異，但它却是有一定的特點的；因爲如果它沒有一定的特點，那它就不能算是一種獨立的小說形式，不能被稱爲短篇小說了。哈米頓在其「小說法程」中曾給短篇小說下了這樣一個定義：「短篇小說之目的，在以最經濟之法，最能動人之力，使發生獨一之叙事文感應。」所謂「叙事文感應」者，在他看來，實含有三要素：「動作，人物，環境是也」。這個定義，雖然巳表面地部分地說出了短篇小說之特點，但是，因爲太抽象，太技術，所以我們看了之後對於短篇小說並沒有明確的槪念。老實說吧，短篇小說的一切，絕不是一條簡單的定義所能表明的，因爲它是一個文學的分野，是一種小說形式，它除具有文學，小說所有的特徵外，其本身還有一定的特點的。</p>
<p>不過，我們在此所急需告訴讀者諸君的，乃是短篇小說的特點，乃是怎樣寫作短篇小說的法則，於文學的本質爲何，小說的定義是什麼，似乎都不是我們在此所當解答的問題。因此，我們便不想從文學，小說講起，然後說到短篇小說，也不想在機械地給短篇小說下一定義之後，再告訴大家怎樣去寫短篇小說；我們所要做的，是要說明短篇小說的特點及怎樣寫作短篇小說的問題：這對於一般想要或者正在開始學寫短篇小說的讀者，想來並不是毫無益處的吧。</p>
<p>首先，是題材問題。短篇小說所採取的題材，當然也和長篇小說的一樣，是社會現象，是人生的故事。不過，因爲短篇小說的字數有限，它不能以龐大複雜的故事爲題林，它所描寫的是社會現象的某一角落！是人生的一個小的片斷。如巴爾扎克的「人間喜劇」，弗羅培爾的「波華莉夫人」，左拉的「羅貢，馬格爾叢書」，托爾斯泰的「戰爭與和平」以及我們的「紅樓夢」「水滸」……等等所採取的那樣複雜的題材，絕不適宜於短篇小說。善於寫短篇小說的作家，便是採取一個簡單的故事爲題材，很扼要而又很精細地來描寫人生的。</p>
<p>不過，好的短篇小說的題材雖然是人生的一個小的片斷，但這個小的片斷却是存在於其時代社會中的一種主要的人生現象。偉大的短篇小說作家是有銳利的眼光的，他能看出其時代社會的各種重要的生活現象，並能找出足以代表那種生活現象的故事和人物，作爲題材，然後生動地來描寫牠。所以，他寫出的作品，能得到多數人的共鳴，有偉大的價値。例如，魯迅的「阿Q正傳」，　題材便是辛亥革命以及「五四」時代的中國社會的一種主要的社會現象；所謂「阿Q式」的人生，是在當時的中國一般糊裏糊塗，有時却又有點自高自大的農民的人生；魯迅抓住了這種時代的重要的社會現象，以阿Q的生活爲中心，將它活生生地描畫出來，所以他獲得了偉大的成功。當然，魯迅的「阿Q正傳」之成功，主要地是在於他的反封建的思想，在於他的辛辣，諷刺的筆調，但其所採取的那樣的題材與共思想和描寫法則却是有很大的關係的。</p>
<p>由此看來，假如你要寫短篇小說，首先便須注意那些主要的社會現象，以那足以代表這社會現象的故事爲題材，從事你的創作。譬如，在目前的中國，其主要的社會現象是：農村破產，工商業衰落，失業失學，一般人的生活窮苦，以及由此產生的自殺殺人，與夫多數知識份子的「羅亭化」，「哈姆雷特化」，……等等，假如你要寫短篇小說，便須以這些現象的一個小而重要的片斷爲題材，把那存在於這些現象中的重要的實際故事的一個小的片斷取來構成你的小說故事：這樣，你所寫出來的事物，才能爲大家所注意，才不致被人認爲是在憑空地造謠或無聊地「殺偏鋒」。</p>
<p>其次，是你的思想問題。你知道，文學是喜歡眞實的。你要想寫出好的短</p>

<h3>從初級到中級</h3>
<p>— 良女士</p>
<p>親愛的哥哥：每當提起筆給你寫信的時侯，心裏就覺得說不出的興奮。</p>
<p>上次你的來信里批評我的話，我完全同意。你說讀書太蕪雜是等於不讀，的確我過去犯了這個毛病，現在願意依照你爲我設想的讀書計劃，一步一步走去。</p>
<p>靠了你和其他朋友的帮助，半年來我自己覺得進步了不少。記得我們量後一次分手的時侯，你說過「不能把握生活，就得被生活腰碎」這一句話，當時我並不了解它的意義，但現在我完全明白了！我要做一個把握生活的人，我要奮鬥，哥哥你看着。</p>
<p>你勸我把化在看雜書上的時間去學習「世界語　」，我也照你的話做了。我上的是世語協會晨班，已經脊一個多月的時間，地點在卡德路郵局對面弄內，距離我們的廠倒不算遠。廠里近來把工作時間延長到十一小時，早上七點鐘就要上工；我的讀書時間是得了主管先生的同意，把早上的一個鐘頭移到晚上做才解决的。身體雖然很疲倦，但精神上却非常痛快，因爲我已經能開始閱讀一點粗淺的書報了。最近世界語協會又辦了暑期班，我巳繼續加入中級。有幾個朋友看到我學世界語這樣容易，他們也想加入初級研究。</p>
<p>以後你還允許我用世界語來通信嗎？</p>
<p>我們晨班的教師H先生是你以前的老同學，從他那邊我學到很多的關於各方面的智識。他的言語程度很好，現在他正在着手從世界語翻譯歐洲各弱小民族的文集，大槪在九月裏就可出版了。以後他還打算把蘇聯電影名作「却巴也夫」的世界語　本轉譯成中文，並且預約我帮忙，我當然很高興，因此現在正在拚命的學習。你知道我自從開始學習到今天，一起纔不過四十多天，可是已經預備翻譯這二十萬言的大作品，你說這不是太大的野心麼？</p>
<p>靠了世界語通信，我認識了許多國外國內的正直的朋友，他們帮助我鼓勵我像你！哥哥帮助我鼓勵我一樣。</p>
<p>如果你有機會到上海來看我，你一定要爲我的漸漸變成堅强勇敢而歡喜，我的哥哥！</p>
<p>望着窗外靜默的夜色和霎着眼的星星，我彷彿看見了你爲眞理的火燃燒着的眼睛，和聽到了你底心的跳躍的聲音。空間的距離是永遠不能分開我們的精神的共鳴的，哥哥！</p>
<p>等着你的回音，祝福你和你的事業！</p>

<p>篇小說，不僅要以那重要的一個片斷為題材，而且還要把這個片斷描寫得眞切。但要把這個人生片斷描寫得很眞切，便需要你的主觀思想與客觀的人生現象相合—你能認識客觀的人生現象之眞實的本質；假使你的主觀思想與客觀的人生現象不合，你不能認識它的眞實性，那你是沒有辦法將它描寫得很眞切，因而你寫出的作品也必然是說不上怎樣成功的。波伊說：「一個巧手的文學的藝術造了一篇故事。他若是聰慧的，他並不將他的思想來　就他的事實；他愼審思想，想出一種該當造成的獨特或單一的效果，然後去杜撰這些事故，——然後再將種種能幫助他建立他所想過的效果的事故連合起來。……」這實在是代表畏懼眞實的人的言論！如果依照這種言論去寫短篇小說，那便是不管客觀事實如何，只是爲了自己的私利，憑着主觀去「杜撰事故」，甚至粉飾現實，亂造謠言：這樣的作品還有價値嗎？假使是不畏懼客觀眞實的人，其自身的需要和思想與客觀眞實的情形和需要相合，那便不會去「杜撰事故」，也不會去「　就事實」；在其認識之下，所採取的題材，所表現的事實和思想，必然是與客觀眞實一致的。因此，你要想認識客觀眞實，把客觀的人生現象描寫得很眞切，便須不畏懼眞實，勇敢地去接近客觀眞實，並站在那些不畏懼客觀眞實的人羣前面，這樣去努力你的短篇小說的寫作，必然是會日益進步的。</p>
<p>最後，便是描寫的方法的事情了。短篇小說因爲字數有限，題材有限，所以，寫起來更須特別簡潔，不能說一句廢話，不能多用或少用一個宇。凡是在長篇小說中的過長的回憶，舖張的叙述，過多的對話和說教，都是寫短篇小說所當忌的。你想，假使莫柏桑寫「項鍊」的時候，要那借人項鍊去赴宴會的夫人在其失掉項鍊而以巨欵去賠償別人後，去作種種想像，把她所經過的各種生活都一一表現出來，或者要她在最後知道她所失去的項鍊是假的時，作種種的苦痛和悔恨狀態甚至作一很長的回憶，那麼，我敢說，「項鍊」必然不會像那樣好，那樣爲人驚歎讚美的。善於寫短篇小說者，是很注意其所表現的思想或故事的中心的，他善於剪裁，凡是與那中心無直接關係的事物，都要被他略去；他只是抓緊那個中心去生動地描寫牠。你看，魯迅的「阿Q正傳」是何等的謹嚴？可以說沒有一句一字是可增减的！這便是好的短篇小說。至於描寫故事，是從終結開始，回溯到前面？從中間開頭展開故事的全部？或是從頭到尾地寫下去？這都可以聽你的便，沒有多大關係。不過，一般說來，還是從頭到尾地寫下去的好，特別是在初學寫短篇小說的時候。同時，所描寫的故事雖然很小，雖然是人生的一個小的片斷，但寫起來仍須與一般現象相聯繫，從一般現象去說明這個小的片斷，以這小的片斷去應證一般現象。譬如，假使你要以一個靑年失業或失戀自殺的故事爲題材，那你便不應站在個人主義的觀點去寫作；而是應從社會的見地去描寫，以之表明目前社會的本體。要這樣，別人才會覺得你在說眞話，你的作品才能使人感動，因而也才有較大的價値。</p>

<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>同時，當時歐美各國資本主義還在向前發展，什么不景氣，失業恐慌等現象還未發生，各地方各產業部門都需要多量的勞力，中國人在過去的商業與農業社會生活中已養成了一種刻苦耐勞的「天性」，正適於歐美各國的需要，所以過去歐美各國常來中國招募華工，把許多動勞的中國國民一批一批地運往海外去了。再者，當歐美各國資本主義迅速發展時，急需開關市塲，找尋天然的富源地：如非洲，如南洋等地方，便是天然富源很豐富的地帶，所以歐美各先進國的勢力都先後到了非洲和南洋等地。但非洲和南洋等地，向來是比較荒僻的，人口也很稀少，要開發其富源，繁榮其市塲，不僅需要很多的勞力，而且還需要增加人口。於是刻苦耐勞的的華人便引起了歐美各先進國之極大的注過去荷屬南洋有一位名叫可顏（Coen）的總督，在其卸任時曾與其繼任者留這樣的意見：（未完）</p>

<h3>River Water Continues to Rise Eight Inches: Wuhan Situation Critical; Changfeng South Embankment Completely Collapses; Low-lying Areas of Zhanggong Embankment Already Flooded; Over 10,000 People Engaged in Flood Control; Water Level Slightly Lower Last Night</h3>
<p>(Hankou) River water rises eight inches, Zhanggong Embankment has a breach of over ten feet, Changfeng South Embankment, Huangjiawan, and Sanyanqiao Embankment in Hanyang all collapse, floating corpses fill the river, embankments in Wuchang are in imminent danger. (Urgent telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yesterday, Changfeng South Embankment in Hankou completely collapsed due to the force of the Xiang River. From Duoluokou, through Sujiadi, Luojiadun, Hanjiadun, Jiangjiadun, Xinjiadi, Zhoujiadun, to the factories of British American Tobacco Company, and the villages along the Hanyi Road, hundreds of miles are flooded, with countless losses. Zhanggong Embankment remains in critical condition. Nanwazi overflows, the area around Boxue Middle School has water depths of over ten feet. A strong wind this morning, all embankments in Wuhan are in danger. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Water is bubbling up from the street center in Special District One, being rescued. The embankment along the river is being raised by one foot from Jianghan Customs. Huangjingtang Embankment breached on the evening of the 12th, being urgently repaired. Twelve people were caught digging the Zhanggong Embankment, four apprehended, reportedly executed by firing squad. Zhanggong Embankment is closed to pedestrians from today. The Xiang River is vast and powerful, overflowing the Changfeng Embankment to the south. The leakage at Danshuichi is extremely severe, the water level at Jintan is level with the embankment surface. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) On the 13th, the river water in Hankou is still rising rapidly. The higher areas of Zhanggong Embankment are only three or four inches above the water, while the lower areas are mostly flooded. Citizens are relocating. According to the Jianghan Customs water level report, the water level in Hankou at 4:00 PM on the 13th was 51 feet 2 inches, a rise of six inches compared to the same time on the 12th. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Cheng溶 has been extremely concerned about flood control issues in recent days. At 3:00 PM on the 13th, he summoned the provincial and municipal party committees to inquire about flood control matters in Wuhan. At 5:00 PM, he led Chen Guang組 to inspect various sections of the Zhanggong Embankment. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Han River embankment has breached, and the muddy torrents are approaching Zhanggong Embankment, reaching over twenty feet at noon on the 13th, threatening to cross the top of the embankment. Cracks have appeared in various parts of the Gusushu Embankment. The military police have mobilized 10,000 personnel to work on flood control, along a length of over twenty miles. However, the river water continues to rise unabated, and the most dangerous period is expected tonight. (Japanese United News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) (Sent at 9:40 PM) At 9:35 PM tonight, the water level dropped from 51 feet 4 inches to 51 feet 3.5 inches. The whole city is peaceful, and the embankments continue to fight the water. Looking down from an airplane this afternoon, Hankou looks like a green dot in a vast sea. However, it is feared that the embankments will not hold for long. Soldiers and coolies are currently busy raising the embankments. Except for low-lying areas where water is seeping up from the sewers, the concessions remain dry. Several places in the Japanese and former German concessions are slightly flooded because there are several holes in the flood control dikes. Now, water is being extracted with water pumps day and night, so the situation is unaffected. (Reuters telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) (Sent at 5:30 PM) As of 5:25 PM this afternoon, the water level has risen to 51 feet 4 inches. A flood seems inevitable. Several sections of the Zhanggong Embankment are in extreme danger, and it is generally believed that it will be difficult to support. Foreigners here do not seem very concerned about the flood, and are still playing ball games despite the hot weather. According to the latest news, the embankments of Yichang and Shashi have not collapsed, and everything is still safe. (Reuters telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou Chamber of Commerce held an emergency meeting on the 12th and resolved: 1. To raise funds for disaster relief; 2. To request the police department to prepare 500 boats; 3. To prepare 1,000 flags for the chamber to be stamped by the police department for the rescue of disaster victims. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water and electricity supply here have not been affected by the flood. If the river water reaches 54 feet, citizens will have no water to drink. The current situation is quite serious. (Japanese United News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Xiaojia Embankment collapsed at 1:00 PM on the 12th. Many residents in the suburbs of Hanyang did not escape in time. More than fifty corpses were found today. (Japanese United News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The situation here remains perilous. The water level retreated to 50 feet 6 inches last night, but rose again to 51 feet 2 inches this morning. The houses near Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. where foreigners reside are now completely empty. Zhang Xueliang told a Reuters reporter today that due to the flow of the Han River, the Zhanggong Embankment may collapse. The current situation of Zhanggong Embankment is quite critical. Weaknesses have been discovered in the embankments of the Japanese and German concessions. Several thousand disaster victims are now living on the Zhanggong Embankment. Chinese sources say that the reports of Yichang being inundated are exaggerated, but there is no doubt that the area has received a great deal of donations. Details are not yet known. (Reuters telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The No. 11 Embankment of the Sanguandian in Zhongxiang County, Han River basin, constructed by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, collapsed on the 9th. The muddy torrents flooded Tianmen County, killing tens of thousands. Food is lacking inside the county town, and residents are starving. There have also been drownings in Mianyang and Hanchuan counties, and the damage is enormous. The fields in the counties along the Han River basin are almost completely destroyed, the railway is blocked, and the damage is incalculable. (Japanese United News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Japanese Civil Corps here convened an emergency committee on the afternoon of the 12th to discuss flood control matters and decided on contingency plans in case the embankment collapses. (Japanese United News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Rejects Establishment of Consulates by the Puppet State; Puppet Government Plans Response</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo Government" had negotiated with the Soviet Russian government to establish consulates in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. The Russian government initially expressed its agreement. As the Manchukuo government prepared, the Russian side suddenly changed its attitude and abruptly refused the Manchukuo government's proposal, citing that the time was not yet ripe. There are six Soviet consulates in Manchukuo, while "Manchukuo" has two consulates in Soviet Russia. There is a need for vigilance in the diplomatic relations between the two countries. The "Manchukuo government" is quite indignant at this move by the Soviet Russia and plans to take appropriate countermeasures. (12th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Actively Laying Double Tracks on the Siberian Railway, Constructing New Roads North of Lake Baikal</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet authorities are currently actively laying double tracks on the Siberian Railway and constructing a new railway north of Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia. This project is entrusted to the responsibility of various People's Committees. However, besides explaining the laying of double tracks, the details regarding the construction of railways, highways, and factories in eastern Siberia, and the obligations borne by the National Defense Committee are not specified. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union is currently spending heavily on constructing projects related to military strategy in Siberia and the western borders of European Russia. The details are unknown, but what is known is that the expenses used by various People's Committees total 96,000,000,000 rubles. (12th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Three Japanese Ambassadors Gather in Canada</h3>
<p>Ottawa: Ambassador to Great Britain Matsudaira and Ambassador to Germany Mushanokoji, who are on leave returning to Japan, arrived here this morning. Ambassador to the United States Saito is also here. The three, along with Minister to Canada Kato, held a meeting at the embassy to exchange opinions on the international situation. It is rumored that the three ambassadors came here to negotiate tariff issues with the Canadian government, but the Japanese embassy denies this, stating that the visit of the three ambassadors to Canada is informal and has nothing to do with negotiations between the Japanese and Canadian governments. (12th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government is scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting on the 16th to decide on invoking the Trade Protection Act against Canada. Foreign Ministry officials plan to continue negotiations even after the act is invoked, demanding that Canada abolish the exchange sales tax and eliminate taxation conversion benefits.

<h3>Belgium Resumes Relations with Soviet Russia; Ambassadors of Both Countries Exchange Documents in Paris</h3>
<p>Brussels: Belgium and the Soviet Union have recently resumed diplomatic relations. Belgian Ambassador to France Gevers d'Aguilar and Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin exchanged official letters in Paris, announcing the matter and stating that the two governments will soon send envoys to each other. Diplomatic relations between Belgium and Russia were interrupted after the Soviet revolution during the European war. The proposal to resume relations was made recently after Prime Minister Theunis formed a national unity cabinet with the participation of the Socialist Party. Last month, Socialist leader and Minister Without Portfolio Vandervelde personally went to Paris to discuss the resumption of relations with Soviet Ambassador Potemkin. (12th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) It was officially announced here last night that diplomatic relations between Soviet Russia and Belgium have been re-established through the exchange of letters between Belgian Ambassador to France Gersteau and Soviet Russian Ambassador to France Potemkin. The Belgian ambassador stated in his letter that, as a result of exchanging views with each other several weeks ago, the Belgian government is prepared to restore diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, exchange ambassadors, and renew old friendships, thereby enhancing the economic relations between the two countries. The Russian ambassador, upon receiving the Belgian ambassador's letter, expressed gratitude on behalf of the Soviet Russian government. (13th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Brussels: An official statement was issued here last night, stating that the Belgian ambassador to France and the Soviet Russian ambassador to France are currently in Paris discussing the resumption of relations.

<h3>Soviet Russia Revises the Constitution, Stalin Takes the Lead</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union has begun the work of revising its constitution. The most important aspect is the revision of the electoral law. In the future, all levels of Soviet elections will be changed to a secret direct ballot system. Although the Soviet Union has always adopted a universal suffrage system, the working class has enjoyed more favorable rights than the peasantry. For every 25,000 workers, one Soviet representative can be elected, while for farmers, it takes 125,000 people to elect one representative. After the constitution is revised, workers and farmers will enjoy equal electoral rights. Therefore, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov stated that the purpose of this constitutional revision is to democratize the constitutional system. The Constitutional Revision Committee is divided into twelve subcommittees. Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, personally serves as the chairman of two subcommittees. Therefore, it is generally believed that the revised new constitution will largely come from Stalin's pen. (13th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russian Foreign Minister to Visit Czechoslovakia in Response to the Czech Foreign Minister's Trip to Moscow</h3>
<p>Prague: Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov has accepted Czechoslovakia's invitation to visit Prague in response to Czech Foreign Minister Beneš's visit. The invitation was delivered by the Czech Minister to Moscow, but the date has not yet been determined, probably after the League of Nations General Assembly in the autumn.

<h3>Another Assassination in Japan: Result of Kumamoto Electric President Refusing to Lower Fees</h3>
<p>Kumamoto: Ueda Manpei, the president of Kumamoto Electric Company, a giant in the Kyushu electric power industry, was reportedly brutally murdered by thugs at 8:00 PM on the 12th. The reason is that Ueda's attitude towards the movement to reduce electricity fees was indifferent, which led to this outrage. Ueda previously served as the governor of Gifu and Miyazaki prefectures before assuming his current position. (13th Denstu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Current Status of World Gold and Silver Flows</h3>
<p>(Washington) For the week ending July 12, the United States saw a sharp increase of $2,446,000 in silver imports. The total value of imports for the week was $5,657,000, with $3,848,000 coming from Mexico, $27,000 from the United Kingdom, $1,009,000 from Canada, $437,000 from Peru, $16,000 from Chile, $292,000 from Hong Kong, $8,000 each from the Philippines and Guatemala, and $12,000 from Russia. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department announced today that silver worth $5,656,000 was imported in the week before July 5. Of this, $3,847,000 came from Mexico and $1,008,000 from Canada, with $436,000 from Peru. The amount of silver imported into the United States from non-silver-producing countries was very small, with only $291,000 coming from Hong Kong. (12th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) During the week ending July 12, British silver exports decreased slightly, while imports increased. During this week, silver worth a total of £556,000 was exported, with £497,000 going to the United States, £21,000 to New Zealand, and £25,000 to the Netherlands. The total value of exports in the previous week was £586,000. The total value of silver imported into the United Kingdom during the week mentioned above was £652,000, with £343,000 coming from Japan, £191,000 from Hong Kong, and £49,000 from India. The net silver inflow for the week recorded was worth £96,000, while the previous week saw a surplus of £71,000. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Department of Commerce announced today that the value of gold imported in the week before July 5 was $2,303,136, while the value of silver exported during the same period was $275,952. (12th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Better Business for British Banks</h3>
<p>(London) According to the half-year balance sheets published by the five major banks, business in the first six months of this year was indeed better than in the same period last year. However, doubtful debt continued to increase to £1,794,000,000, compared to £1,682,000,000 on June 30 last year, proving that the path to investment has not yet been broadened. Therefore, long-term investment continued to increase by £64,500,000, and doubtful debt to current accounts increased by approximately £19,000,000, but still only accounted for 41.4 percent of total reserves. It needs to reach 50 percent to be appropriate. Bills of exchange increased by £7,500,000, mostly due to an increase in commercial bills. Treasury bond reserves are trending downwards. Now that commercial demand is reviving, the Times raises the question of how long-term investments will be handled. The Times believes that banks will not massively sell their government bonds, as the large amount of capital required by industry seems to be met by the huge amounts of capital in storage.

<h3>Observations on the Authority of the League of Nations Amidst European Turmoil</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>The turmoil in Europe has persisted since the Great War, but the unease and instability have been particularly pronounced in recent years. Besides Soviet Russia, there are two countries seeking stability in Europe: France and England. Their method of achieving stability largely relies on the League of Nations as the key to resolving all disputes. Therefore, restoring the authority and supplementing the strength of the League of Nations are necessary steps for stabilizing Europe. Since last year, as a result of French diplomatic efforts, there has been first the coordination between France and Russia, followed by Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations, which added a new force to the League after the withdrawal of Japan and Germany. This spring, there was also the establishment of the Franco-Italian Accord, which resolved the decades-long suspicions, jealousies, and open and secret struggles between the two countries in one fell swoop. The chaotic situation in Europe has also become significantly clearer. Subsequently, the Anglo-French London Declaration expressed a unified opinion on stabilizing Europe. By the time of the Stresa Conference, the diplomatic front of England, France, and Italy was even more unified. At the time, almost everyone who discussed the international situation regarded it as a major turning point for peace in Europe. Who would have thought that the authority of the League of Nations had not yet been fully restored, and the various agreements in the French bag had not yet been realized, and the League of Nations was again encountering serious difficulties. The contradictions in the European situation have also become more acute.</p>
<p>The reason why the current European situation has become more complex lies in the inability of England, France, and Italy to align their interests. The most obvious is the difference in the three countries' attitudes toward the League of Nations. In France's mind, the League of Nations is purely a tool to restrain Germany. Its purpose is only peace in Europe. As for whether the League of Nations has authority outside Europe, it does not bother to inquire. Italy, on the other hand, has never had a good impression of the League of Nations. The recent slight enthusiasm for it can be largely regarded as a gesture of gratitude to France. What it seeks is only to maintain peace in Central Europe. Apart from this, it does not need to rely on the League of Nations. Only England has a global perspective and wants to make the League of Nations an organization to maintain international peace. However, England is not without its criticisms. Although the three countries have different attitudes toward the League of Nations, they all take their own interests as their position. When the League of Nations can be used, they use it. If it hinders their actions, they treat it as nothing. For example, Italy indulges in its desire for colonies and openly opposes the intervention of the League of Nations. In order to maintain Italy's goodwill, France not only turns a deaf ear to Italy's actions, but also repeatedly prevaricates when England requests joint intervention, not wanting to offend Italy. Is this not a contradictory behavior of supporting the League of Nations on the one hand and undermining the League of Nations on the other? How can the establishment of the League of Nations be achieved in this way? As for England, the sudden establishment of a naval agreement with Germany this time, strictly speaking, cannot but be said to be a blow to the spirit of the League of Nations. According to Article 19 of the League of Nations Charter, the revision of the peace treaty must be approved by the League of Nations Assembly. Although Germany's rearmament is not entirely blameworthy, England hastily established a naval agreement with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations. From a legal point of view, it is not entirely consistent with the League of Nations Charter. It can be said that England's spirit of supporting the League of Nations is also inconsistent. Now, if it wants to occupy the position of leader of the League of Nations and intervene in Italy, it is no wonder that Italy retorts with sarcasm.</p>
<p>In short, among the major European powers today, there is no country that can absolutely abide by the Charter of the League of Nations and consistently uphold the authority of the League of Nations. Italy is blatantly undermining the League of Nations, and France is not wholeheartedly supporting it. England's attitude is also inconsistent. Therefore, as far as the current situation is concerned, the establishment of the authority of the League of Nations, the stability of the European situation, and the safeguarding of world peace are still far from reality.</p>
<h3>Frequent Military Transport in Italian East Africa; 100,000 Italian Troops Have Crossed the Suez Canal, but France Has a New Proposal That Is Well Received: Abyssinia Under Italian Mandate</h3>
<p>Asmara: Although Geneva still holds out hope that an Italo-Abyssinian war can be averted, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is sending a large army to Italian East African territories. The port of Massawa in Northeast Africa, which used to be deserted and extremely hot (reaching 120 degrees in the shade), has suddenly become very lively. Military supplies are piled up on the docks, as high as mountains, and heavy machinery is being unloaded from ships, including tanks, aircraft, heavy artillery, and mules and horses, all day long. There are usually four or five large cargo ships docked in the port, and they cannot unload their cargo because the docks are not empty. Water is scarce, and soldiers are limited to two pints. A major road is being rushed to be built through the mountains to alleviate railway congestion, as there is only one railway, just 120 miles long, and this is the only way to transport goods. The construction of the road is a great challenge for Italian engineers. Since March 27, 100,000 Italian troops have crossed the Suez Canal, and more will cross next month. Egyptian authorities are making every effort to cope with the congestion caused by the endless stream of troop transport ships arriving there. To avoid the heat, Italian soldiers remove their upper bodies and night clothes, resulting in several deaths from heatstroke. Donkeys and mules in Palestine, Cyprus, and Syria have been completely requisitioned. The docks and warehouses in Sudanese ports are also piled high with Italian war equipment. Arabs in Yemen, hearing of the high wages, are now flocking to Massawa to work. Meanwhile, the Abyssinian people are also preparing for war. According to London reports, large quantities of munitions are being unloaded in the Abyssinian capital of Addis Ababa. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) France has now put forward a proposal for the Abyssinian problem. According to the Iraq model, Italy would be mandated to govern by the League of Nations. Diplomats here are considering this proposal. Abyssinia should have fulfilled the conditions of the League of Nations when it joined in 1923, but it has not done so to date. The only option is to treat it as a special case. According to today's news, Italy seems to be quite receptive to this proposal, but British officials are taking a cold attitude and not making any comments. If this plan becomes a reality, most of Abyssinia will be under Italian rule, except for the Lake Tana region, which will fall within the British sphere of influence, and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti area, which will fall within the French sphere of influence. If Abyssinia does not approve of this plan, Italy will invoke Article 15, paragraph 7 of the League of Nations Charter and has the right to wage war on Abyssinia. (12th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Secretary-General to Go to Paris for Negotiations and Meet Abyssinian Representatives</h3>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol is scheduled to depart for Paris tomorrow (Havas, 13th).</p>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently came here to discuss the Abyssinian issue with British authorities. He is now scheduled to go to Paris early next week to report the results of the discussions to French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval. If the prospects for negotiations are optimistic at that time, Avenol may meet with the Abyssinian permanent representative to the League of Nations (Havas, 12th).</p>
<p>(London) The governments of Britain, France, and Italy, as well as League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, are currently engaged in negotiations to find a basis for an agreement in order to convene a conference of relevant countries to resolve the Abyssinian issue. It is reported that Italy has not yet accepted this solution. Presumably, Italy will not accept this approach unless a basis for negotiation is established and it is favorable to Italy's demands. Avenol previously spoke with the Abyssinian permanent representative to the League of Nations in Paris. Therefore, Avenol must have a clear understanding of Abyssinia's views on the proposed conference of relevant countries. However, people at the League of Nations believe that there is a wide gap between the positions of Italy and Abyssinia, and it may be difficult to find a compromise (Havas, 13th).</p>
<p>(London) A solution to the Abyssinian issue is currently being negotiated by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, British cabinet members, and Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi. It is reported that the purpose of the negotiations is to convene a conference of the three signatory countries to the 1906 treaty on Abyssinia: Britain, France, and Italy. The details of the negotiations are being kept strictly secret by officials, but it is generally believed that Avenol will not take any diplomatic steps before leaving London at the end of this week. According to the 1906 Three-Power Treaty on Abyssinia, Britain, France, and Italy agreed to maintain the political and territorial status quo of Abyssinia. In the event of internal disturbances in Abyssinia, the signatory countries agreed to adopt a neutral attitude towards Abyssinia's internal affairs. All actions by the signatory countries should be limited to protecting the lives and property of embassies and foreigners, as well as the common interests of the signatory countries. Moreover, even such actions must be implemented only after each signatory country mutually agrees that it is necessary. The three governments also agreed that in no circumstances should any of the three countries intervene in Abyssinian affairs without mutual consultation. If the political and territorial status quo of Abyssinia is shaken, the three governments agreed to maintain the political and territorial integrity of Abyssinia with all their capabilities. The convening of this conference of Britain, France, and Italy is probably based on the above-mentioned treaty provisions. However, the most difficult point at present is that Britain and Italy cannot agree on the boundaries of Italy's sphere of influence. Although the 1906 treaty generally stipulates the spheres of influence of Britain, France, and Italy, the boundaries of the spheres of influence are not specified in detail in the treaty (Havas, 12th).</p>
<h3>Avenol's Speech: The Mission to England Relies on the League of Nations for a Stable Solution to Nationality Issues</h3>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol delivered a radio address tonight, stating that if we return to the old ways and adhere to the principle of non-interference in international relations, there will be no hope for progress. His duty is not to negotiate, but to deal with various issues involving the League of Nations that are discussed by the governments of various countries. The main purpose of his trip to England is to meet with British Foreign Secretary Hoare and discuss with Prime Minister Baldwin and Eden some of the events that the League of Nations has experienced. Countries have a need to find a more stable method of international resolution on a common basis, and the League of Nations is the one that can truly represent the opinions of these countries. We must not be disappointed because the League of Nations has suffered a setback, and we must not forget the achievements that the League of Nations has already made, because the League of Nations has shown that it can adapt to current needs (Reuters, 12th).</p>
<h3>The Main Theme of the US Meetings with Britain, France, and Italy</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, Secretary of State Hull's repeated meetings with the ambassadors of Britain, France, and Italy have as one of their main purposes to express the United States' concern about the list of contraband that Italy and Abyssinia intend to issue in the event of war, so that neutral countries can abide by it. Today, a senator claimed that a similar situation existed from 1914 to 1916, hindering American shipping and ultimately leading to the United States joining the war. This time, the US government will clearly state that it has decided its own policy in advance regarding what goods can be supplied to belligerents, and will not allow others to make plans on its behalf. After talking with the ambassadors of Britain, France, and Italy today, Secretary Hull issued a relevant statement to reporters, reiterating the United States' faith in the Kellogg-Briand Pact, saying that this pact is still binding and is no different from when it was signed. The United States and other countries all want to maintain this pact and the dignity of the international obligations undertaken to promote and maintain peace among all countries in the world (Reuters, 12th).</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull attended a press conference yesterday. When asked about the United States' attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, Hull replied, "The obligations of the Paris Peace Pact are still valid today, and are no different from when 63 governments signed the pact. According to the pact, the signatory governments oppose the resolution of international disputes by war. The United States, like other signatory countries, wishes to see the pact respected and, in particular, wishes its obligations to be observed by the signatory countries" (Havas, 13th).</p>
<p>(London) It was learned here today that Britain and the United States have decided to cooperate on the departure of foreign residents from Abyssinia in the event of war in Africa (National Telegram, 12th).</p>
<p>Marseille George (given name) Hanson (surname), the US Chargé d'Affaires in the capital of Abyssinia, recently boarded a ship here to take up his post. According to his remarks to the press, "The United States is adopting a spectator attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian dispute and is paying attention to the development of the situation. There is still no intention to change this attitude at this time. The United States is particularly concerned about the economic development of Abyssinia. The United States may be entrusted by the Abyssinian government to build sluices on the Nile River. As for my first task after taking office, it will be to protect the safety of overseas Chinese. There are three embassy staff members, one hundred and ten missionaries, and twelve black people among the Americans in Abyssinia" (Havas, 12th).</p>
<p>(Rome) The authorities here announced today that Secretary of State Hull's attention to the Italian-Abyssinian issue is unwelcome and unnecessary. They were surprised that Hull previously stated that this dispute had nothing to do with the United States, but now expressed a change of tune to the Italian Ambassador to the United States, Rosso. They were very impressed with the speech delivered by British Foreign Secretary Hoare to the House of Commons yesterday (National Telegram, 12th).</p>
<h3>Italian Side Announces New Incidents</h3>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official Stefani news agency released a message stating that there have been disputes in Qeymebayt, on the Italian-Abyssinian border. The following three incidents are among the most recent: (1) Two Somali herdsmen belonging to Italy drove their cattle herd to an area near Qeygora, inadvertently crossing the border and entering Abyssinian territory. They were detained by Abyssinian soldiers, who demanded a tax of four Thalers (currency name) per head of livestock. Because the two herdsmen were unable to pay, the Abyssinian soldiers confiscated the cattle and beat the herdsmen. (2) The Abyssinian authorities in the Adua area arrested 25 people one after another because they had sold food to the Italian consul there. (3) The wife of an Italian consul was traveling with a camel caravan to Eritrea when she was detained by Abyssinian soldiers in the Gonda district and held for one day. She was released after the consul protested (Havas, 12th).</p>
<h3>German Lemon Shortage Due to East African Affairs</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany is experiencing a large shortage of lemons, due to the large consumption of lemons by Italian troops in East Africa and the poor lemon harvest in Italy. As a result, prices in Germany have risen. According to the Price Control Committee, Germans should use German fruit acid as a substitute for lemons (National Telegram, 12th).</p>
<h3>Red Cross Society Again Requests Membership</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Abyssinia has not signed the Geneva International Red Cross Convention. Therefore, Abyssinia is not bound by respect for the Red Cross emblem, but it also has no right to fly the Red Cross flag to protect its battlefield wounded. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been requesting the Abyssinian government to join the Geneva Convention for several years without result. Recently, due to the imminent Italian-Abyssinian War, the International Committee of the Red Cross has sent a letter to the Abyssinian Emperor, reiterating this request. It is also reported that the International Red Cross has established a committee in London to handle Abyssinian relief matters. However, relief teams cannot fly the Red Cross flag unless they have been granted permission by the Abyssinian government. The International Committee of the Red Cross is currently working to find a way to resolve this difficulty, but everything will have to wait for a reply from Abyssinia before it can be resolved (Havas, 13th).</p>
<h3>Austrian Prime Minister's Car Accident: Wife Dies Instantly; Deputy Prime Minister Rushes Back Upon Hearing the News</h3>
<p>Vienna Austrian Prime Minister Dr. Schuschnigg and his wife were traveling by car for a holiday today when the car crashed into a tree near Landschloss. The car was destroyed, and his wife died instantly. Schuschnigg was hospitalized due to excessive shock. His daughter and a seven-year-old son were also in the car with the Austrian Prime Minister and his wife. It is not yet known how the car accident occurred. It is believed that the driver was momentarily dizzy, causing the car to crash into a tree. Everyone in the car was thrown out at the time. His wife died immediately. Schuschnigg and his children were fortunate not to be injured. The driver was seriously injured. A police officer in the car also suffered minor injuries. After the news of the accident spread here, the cabinet held a meeting. Deputy Prime Minister Starhemberg, who is currently on vacation in Venice, flew back to Vienna by special plane upon receiving the news. He will probably act as Prime Minister pending Schuschnigg's recovery (Reuters, 13th).</p>
<h3>Romanian Authorities Decide on Joint Action to Deal with the Austrian Restoration Issue</h3>
<p>(Paris) A correspondent for Le Matin claims that the authorities of Yugoslavia and Romania, when meeting at the Royal Palace in Romania, believed that the restoration of Austria was by no means a good sign. As a result of yesterday's talks between King Carol and Prince Paul, a common approach to deal with this matter has been agreed upon. Yugoslavia's and Romania's unease over Austria's trend towards restoration has become public knowledge. The two countries have also decided to take strict measures to prevent the realization of this plan. Furthermore, given that the Czech government supports the restoration of Austria, cooperation among the Little Entente may not be possible. Therefore, Romania and Yugoslavia may proceed with their plan independently if necessary (National Telegram, 13th).</p>
<p>Bucharest Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul arrived here this morning, but the exact time was kept strictly secret beforehand to avoid demonstrations. After getting out of the car, Prince Paul entered a waiting car and proceeded to the Royal Palace, arriving at 11:00 AM. He was welcomed by King Carol of Romania, Crown Prince Michael, Prime Minister Tătărescu, and the current cabinet members. After exchanging greetings, the entire group gathered in the floral carriage of Foreign Minister Titulescu, who had rushed back from London and Paris. Titulescu described the diplomatic and political situation in the carriage for two hours. King Carol then dined with Prince Paul, Prime Minister Tătărescu, Foreign Minister Titulescu, and Army Minister Angelescu at the Peleș Castle, and then resumed the meeting. Titulescu reported that he had informed the British government of the attitude of the Little Entente and the Balkan countries towards the Austrian restoration. Prince Paul plans to return to Bren, Yugoslavia, on Sunday to meet with Greek Army Minister General Kondylis, who is scheduled to travel from Rome to the area on Monday (National News Agency, 12th).</p>
<p>Sinaia, Romania Foreign Minister Titulescu recently visited Britain and France to discuss international issues and has now returned home to report the results of the visits to the cabinet and explain that the policies of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente have remained unchanged. All of these countries fully agree to continue to promote this policy. Titulescu declared that the relationship is extremely important, because there are rumors that Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul's visit is due to the differences in opinion between the Czech Republic and Yugoslavia regarding the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria. It is said that Yugoslavia is strongly opposed to the restoration, while the Czech Republic believes that the restoration is the only way to prevent the union of northern Germany and Austria, and has expressed its support. Romania is in a difficult position between the two countries, and must decide whether to support the Czech Republic or help Yugoslavia. These rumors have now been denied by Titulescu (Havas, 12th).</p>
<h3>British Emperor Inspects the Army, All Four Sons Attend</h3>
<p>(London) The British Emperor and Queen inspected the army today, with all four sons in attendance. Tens of thousands of spectators watched. The Emperor, in the uniform of a grand marshal, stood erect on the viewing platform and did not move except to raise his hand in salute. The spectators cheered continuously (Reuters, 13th).</p>
<h3>Hitler Inspects the Air Force and Visits a Motor Factory</h3>
<p>Munich Chancellor Hitler, accompanied by Army Minister Blomberg, Aviation Minister Göring, and Aviation Affairs Officer Milke, inspected the Bavarian Motor Factory yesterday. After the event, he went to the nearby Lechfeld airfield to inspect the air force there (National Telegram, 13th).</p>
<h3>French Police Search Workers' District in Paris and Seize a Large Number of Rifles</h3>
<p>(Paris) As a result of repeated searches by the police in the workers' district of Paris, a large number of rifles were seized from second-hand shops. The search was clearly to prevent incidents that may occur tomorrow, as left-wing and fascist groups are planning to hold demonstrations tomorrow. The situation in the entire city is extremely tense today. 20,000 police officers and a large number of police officers from various provinces have been dispatched to deal with incidents. In addition, the regular army stationed in Paris, with the exception of a small number participating in the parade, has been ordered to remain in their barracks (National Telegram, 12th).</p>
<p>(Paris) Tomorrow, Sunday, all parties will hold group parades to commemorate the National Day. The police authorities have banned private aircraft from flying over Paris on this day in order to prevent the throwing of inflammatory leaflets from airplanes. Although the police authorities have drawn up various preventive measures to deal with the clashes between left-wing and right-wing groups, they still feel it is necessary to prohibit foreigners from participating in the group parades. Therefore, they have warned foreigners that if any foreigners participate in the demonstrations, they will be deported once discovered. All police officers will be dispatched from tonight, Saturday, until Monday morning next week to prevent disturbances.

They then fired live ammunition into the crowd, killing two people and injuring several others, some of whom were seriously injured. One of the dead was a woman. During the height of the riots, someone fired a gun from the roof of a building on New York Street, and the police returned fire, injuring several people in the area. After dispersing the rioters, the police patrolled the riot area in armed vehicles. By 1:00 AM, the area was as safe as usual.

<h3>Judgment on the Peking Union Medical College Hospital Lawsuit</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The verdict in the case where Ms. Ryder, an American residing in Tianjin, sued the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in the American court for neglect of duty was announced today. It stated that the plaintiff accused the defendant of failing to fulfill its medical duties, resulting in the death of his wife. It was found that the medical community currently has no standard treatment method for cancer and the origin of cancer. Therefore, cancer researchers around the world are constantly researching and experimenting, and cancer treatment methods are changing almost daily. The treatment given by the defendant was at least as good as what other hospitals in China could provide. Therefore, the court believes that the defendant did not neglect his duties or lack ordinary skills. The plaintiff is responsible for the litigation costs (13th).</p>

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Accuses Ma Rong of False Accusation</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Ma Zhanshan case continued to be heard on the morning of the 13th. Ma himself did not appear and was still represented by his secretary Du Xunruo, who brought recent photos to submit as evidence. Du defended the three items: 1. Ma Rong's lost son has a stake for hitching a horse behind his ear, while Ma does not; 2. Ma Rong is 51 years old, born on October 24th, while Ma Rong's lost son is 52 years old, born on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month. Ma's original name was Zhenbang. When he became a battalion commander, Wu Junsheng changed his name to Zhanshan. Ma Rong's son's original name was Jinshan. The court asked Ma Rong whether he had any other evidence. Ma Rong insisted that Ma must appear in court for questioning. The court ruled that the evidence was insufficient and ordered another hearing. On the same day, Du Xunruo submitted a statement on behalf of Ma accusing Ma Rong of false accusation. After the court approved the statement and interrogated Ma Rong, it ordered Ma Rong to be released on bail. General observation suggests that Ma Rong may have a son missing. Because of his strong desire to find his son, he heard rumors and identified Ma as his son. The court may not prosecute him for false accusation due to his old age. Both cases are likely to be dismissed (Special Dispatch, 13th).</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Speech on the Responsibility of Youth</h3>
<p>—Attending an Enlarged Memorial Week in Chengdu—</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: At 9:00 AM on the 8th, Chairman Chiang attended the sixth enlarged memorial week in Rong (Chengdu). It was held on the open space in front of the Zhigong Hall in the Royal City. Those present included Chairman Chiang, Secretary-General Yang, Director He, Chairman Liu, Army Commander Deng, Army Commander Liu, generals of various armies, representatives of various party and government agencies, various legal entities, various newspapers, and school staff, as well as the city's Boy Scouts, military training students from various schools, and all students taking the joint entrance examination, totaling more than 6,000 people. After Chairman Chiang led the participants in performing the ceremony as required, he delivered an impromptu speech as follows:</p>
<p>"Chairman Liu, respected principals, teachers, military training corps, and Boy Scout students, both male and female: Today, we gather everyone at Sichuan University for the Memorial Week of the Leader. This is a very rare opportunity. I, Chiang Kai-shek, am the Commander-in-Chief of the National Boy Scouts of the Republic of China and also the Chief Instructor of the National Military Training Corps. You Boy Scouts and military training students, as well as general middle school students participating in the joint entrance examination, are all my students, that is, my children. Therefore, today I have specially gathered everyone to tell you about the responsibilities you should bear and the cultivation you should have, and I hope everyone will pay special attention.</p>
<p>Now our country and nation are being invaded and oppressed by others, and cannot be independent and free, to the point of being in such a difficult and critical situation. What is the reason for this? You must thoroughly understand this reason, because you are the future masters of the country. In the future, how should we carry on the past, turn danger into safety, turn weakness into strength, and restore the independence and freedom of our country and nation? This responsibility rests entirely on you young people. Most people who are older now will die in twenty or thirty years, and the responsibility for the country and the world in the future will depend entirely on you to continue to shoulder it. If you can work hard in time, strive to become strong, and enable the country to be independent and the nation to be free, you can increase the glory of the country and nation, which is your glory. Conversely, if the country and nation cannot achieve a position of independence and freedom, and the country is eventually destroyed, you will become slaves and beasts of burden, suffering hardship and disaster, and your descendants will suffer torture for who knows how long. You must always remember that our Chinese nation, since its founding, has continued to pass on this beautiful land and noble culture to us. Now we have such a large land, such a good culture, and even more such a large number of compatriots. If we cannot save the country and revive the nation, carry on the past, restore our past glory, and create a new, independent, and free country to fulfill our great historical mission, then we have lived in this world in vain and have let down our Yellow Emperor ancestors and our parents. Therefore, you who will be the masters of the country in the future must take the world and the country as your own responsibility and take saving the country and the people as your only aspiration.</p>
<p>If we want to make the country independent and the nation free, first we should strengthen ourselves. That is, we must work hard at all times to forge a strong physique, cultivate a noble character, create rich intelligence, promote a spirit of tenacity and bravery, develop habits of hard work and discipline, and create healthy citizens of an independent country. With such healthy citizens, the country and nation will have a solid foundation for independence and freedom. With this foundation, we can then build a new country of freedom and independence, and then we can revive the nation. Secondly, if we want freedom and equality for our country and nation, we must sacrifice our personal freedom to seek the freedom of the country, and sacrifice our personal equality to seek the equality of the nation. We must contribute everything we have to the country and the nation in order to obtain the freedom and equality of the entire country and nation. If we individuals want to talk about freedom, the country and nation will be oppressed by others. If we individuals want to talk about equality, the status of the country and nation will decline, and eventually even the survival of the country will not be guaranteed. Everyone must know, what is the meaning of the so-called freedom and equality of the country? It means having a complete territory and sovereignty, independent spirit and national character. How do we sacrifice our personal freedom and equality to seek the freedom and equality of the country? That is, we must be able to strictly observe discipline and obey orders at all times and in all places. At home, we must obey our parents and abide by family rules. At school, we must obey teachers and abide by school rules. In the Boy Scouts and military training corps, we must obey the squad leaders, platoon leaders, and team leaders, and abide by military discipline and corps rules. In society, we must obey all levels of government and abide by all laws and regulations. Only when we can strictly observe discipline, obey leaders, and concentrate everyone's spirit and ability to serve the country and society can this country be considered a truly organized modern country. Only then can we generate overall strength to fight for freedom and equality, protect our five thousand years of glory, and in the future, you yourselves and your descendants can be true masters of the Republic of China. This is the most important principle of conduct and responsibility that you should understand. If you do not understand these principles and responsibilities of saving the country, it is useless to wear Boy Scout caps and uniforms or student uniforms. In reality, you will not be responsible for the future of the country and nation, but will be indifferent and complacent. Then you are not worthy of being a citizen of the Republic of China, let alone the master of the country. The above is about the responsibility of us young people in fighting for the freedom and equality of the country and nation, and in saving the country and reviving the nation. Below, I will talk about the position and responsibility that we as individuals, especially we young people, occupy in various different areas.</p>
<p>First, we must recognize our position and responsibility in the universe. When I teach faculty to enroll students, the first important thing is to tell them that the world and their parents gave birth to us, especially those who have become members of the educated class, about their position in the universe and their responsibilities. They must first understand this principle before they can be taught to become a good person. It must be understood that man is the most intelligent of all things, that is, the master of the universe, and we should give play to our intelligence and ability to understand the universe, control the universe, conquer nature, and utilize nature, and constantly create human culture. All things in the universe, whether sound, light, electricity, or force, whether moving, planting, mining, or other things, we must all be able to give play to our talents and intelligence to control everything, conquer everything, and utilize everything, so that the useless becomes useful and the harmful becomes beneficial. For example, when floods cause disasters, we must find ways to dredge them to develop water conservancy. When beasts cause disasters, we must eradicate or tame them. Our ancestors have paid great attention to the conquest and utilization of nature since ancient times. For example, Shennong invented medicine to relieve people's pain, the Yellow Emperor built palaces and made boats and carts, and invented the compass to facilitate living and transportation. Canzu invented sericulture to make silk, so that people had clothes to wear, and Hou Ji invented agriculture, so that people had food to eat. Dayu controlled floods, so that people could live in peace. These are all great achievements in conquering and utilizing nature to improve human life and create human civilization. Now, human civilization is advancing by leaps and bounds, and it is all due to mankind fully developing their innate talents and controlling the universe and conquering nature. Everything natural in the universe, in all its categories, is waiting for us to utilize it. There is no end to the new civilization of mankind, and it is all waiting for us to create it. In the past, our ancestors were very capable of developing their intelligence and constantly creating civilization, so our country was very strong in the past. Now, we descendants cannot develop our intelligence and continue to create new civilizations, due to the general rule of "if you do not advance, you will retreat," causing the country to fall into poverty and weakness, and the people's livelihood to become increasingly desolate. From this, we can know that if we want to save and transform the country and nation in the future, so that it can reach a realm of prosperity and strength, we must fully develop the inherent intelligence of our nation to constantly control the universe, conquer nature, and create new civilizations. In this way, we will not be ashamed of being descendants of the Yellow Emperor and citizens of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Second, we must recognize our position and responsibility in the country. I have already roughly explained the position and responsibility of us young students in the country. You are the future masters of the country, and the responsibility for the rise and fall of the country in the future rests entirely on you. It can be seen how important your position is and how great your responsibility is. In the future, you must take the weight of the world and the country upon yourselves, strive hard, be self-reliant and self-reliant, earnestly take on the responsibility of carrying on the past, maintain the glorious history of our Chinese nation for five thousand years, and thereby promote and develop it, and create a country of the Three Principles of the People that is free and independent, standing proudly in the universe, seeking happiness for our 400 million compatriots, and establishing an indestructible foundation for our descendants.</p>
<p>Third, we must recognize our position and responsibility in society. You are all intellectuals in society, the backbone of society. Your talents and abilities are higher than those of ordinary people in general, and your circumstances are better than those of ordinary people in general, so your responsibility to society is even greater. What is this responsibility? In general, it is to labor and serve for society, and to seek benefits and create happiness for the people. In particular, we must do what is right, come forward bravely, and help the poor and suffering compatriots in general. One of the most important tenets of your Boy Scouts is "Do one good deed a day." This means that we must use the heart of loving others to extend our love to the general compatriots in society, and always do something every day to help others or benefit society, so that others and we can have clothes to wear and food to eat, without pain, and share happiness. This is the spirit of the ancients, "feeling hungry as if I were hungry, and feeling drowned as if I were drowned," and "regarding the people as my own children and treating all things as my equals." The ancients also said, "A scholar should be the first to worry about the affairs of the world, and the last to enjoy its pleasures." It can be seen that we intellectuals should be particularly concerned about the suffering of our compatriots in general and do our best to help them, so that we can fulfill our responsibility. Therefore, we must never only care about our own personal well-being and happiness, but must always remember the cold, hunger, and disease of our compatriots in general. As you have all seen, in Sichuan society today, there are countless displaced and helpless compatriots. As soon as you go out, you can see hard-working compatriots with sallow faces and thin bones, unable to push their carts or carry their loads, sweating like rain, and extremely exhausted, but they have to struggle hard to survive. How painful they are! We should help them at all times and in all places to reduce their suffering. You must know that foreigners, especially young students, will rush to help anyone who falls ill or falls on the road. If someone cannot push their cart or the cart overturns, they will do their best to help. If they see someone in trouble, they will do their best to help. They have developed this general spirit and habit of labor service. Now, we Chinese people are often the opposite. Not to mention those who have no knowledge, even you Boy Scouts and students receiving military training, I am afraid that few people can truly labor and serve society. Many people do not even labor at all. To give one of the most common examples, I see many students everywhere on the street, even Boy Scouts, who want to ride in rickshaws. You do not pull rickshaws for the elderly or serve society yourselves, and you have not fulfilled your responsibility. How can you want others to pull you? If there is no unavoidable circumstance, this is very wrong. You must know that a person born into society should take labor as life and service as his duty. If he is lazy and loves ease, he will become a parasite in society. If he becomes a parasite, he will eventually become a slave to a foreign country. We have been nurtured by society and should seek happiness for society. If we want to seek happiness for society, first we must be able to work hard and do everything ourselves. If we cannot do it ourselves, we should ask friends for help, and at the same time, we should do our best to help others at all times and in all places, especially to help our suffering compatriots in general. If we see someone fall on the road, we should help them up. If someone falls ill, we should rescue them. If the rickshaw pullers and those carrying heavy loads cannot pull or carry them, we should help them. These are the starting points for us to serve society and benefit mankind, and they are also the duties that each of us should fulfill to society. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Protecting Hankou's Zhang Gong Dyke Is Extremely Critical</h3>
<p>Once Overflowed and Still Not Safe, the Whole City Is in Turmoil. All Dikes and Gates in Wuchang Are Leaking and Impossible to Defend. The Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway Is Three Feet Deep and Traffic Is Interrupted Again.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The waters of the Yangtze River in Hankou continued to rise rapidly on the 10th and 11th. As of noon on the 12th, the Jianghan Customs water level reached 50 feet and 8 inches. All dikes and gates in Wuhan are completely alarmed and the situation is serious, which is not comparable to a few days ago. Zhang Gong Dyke, the only guarantee for the entire city of Hankou, once overflowed due to the rapid rise of the Han River, which was higher than the dike surface, causing turmoil in the city. Fortunately, officials, civilians, soldiers, and police worked together to rescue it, avoiding a breach, but it was still not safe until late at night. Zhang Gong Dyke was built during the Guangxu period of the Former Qing Dynasty, and the project was very solid. Recently, the Xiang River has experienced a strange rise in water, and the pressure is too great, so it has become unsustainable. On the 11th, the water of the Xiang River was still three feet away from the dike surface. Overnight, the water suddenly rose by more than five feet, and the lower dike surface was one to two feet lower than the water surface. The water overflowed the dike at about 11:00 AM on the 12th, and the area around Boxue Middle School suddenly had a water level of more than ten feet. The Qiaokou and Shenjia Temple areas could be navigated by boat. The residents inside the dike were terrified, helping the old and carrying the young, and fleeing to the Pinghan Railway dike. There were more than 100,000 people, and boxes and belongings were piled up like hills. At this time, Wu Guozhen, the Mayor of Hankou, and Chen Xizeng, the Director of Public Security, were supervising the work on the dike. Seeing the water overflowing, they immediately ordered more than 10,000 laborers, together with the military and police, to stack sandbags to block the water. The water began to flow south over Nanyuefeng Bay and north over the Hubei East Automobile Road, entering the river through Chenjiaji. Zhang Gong Dyke was temporarily preserved. Zhang Xueliang, Qian Dajun, He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, Ye Peng, and others heard the news and went to inspect the dike. It was temporarily decided to raise the dike body and send a telegram to the Huangpi area to purchase a soil mountain, and requisition 170 trucks in the city to transport soil to Hankou, pack it, and fill the dike. On one side, the single-hole gate and double-hole gate were blocked to prevent river water from pouring into the urban area. When the dike was in urgent situation, it was discovered that twelve bandits were secretly digging. The military and police discovered this and immediately arrested them. Eight bandits escaped, and four bandits were arrested. It is said that they were immediately executed by shooting. It is said that they were instigated by a certain party and are being interrogated strictly. In the evening, the water in the Xiang River receded by several inches, but the dike was still not safe. Danshuichi and Chenjiaji were still leaking. There was a breach in the Huangjingtang dike. Water was gushing from the street center in Special Zone One, and rescue efforts were underway. Citizens throughout the city feared another flood and moved one after another.</p>
<p>Various agencies and organizations in Wuhan are now preparing for flood prevention. The Garrison Command has stipulated ten measures to order the garrison agencies and troops to pay attention to: (1) The command headquarters, special service battalion, and public security bureau in each district should send teams day and night to patrol the dikes within their respective jurisdictions to strictly prevent criminals from taking the opportunity to secretly dig into the dike body, and supervise their subordinates to work hard to help with the rescue; (2) If the dike breaches, the alarm bell should be sounded and gongs should be beaten to warn. The gongs should be beaten 30 times every five seconds; (3) If a certain dike is about to breach and cannot be rescued, or when the alarm bell is sounded, people living near low-lying areas should be quickly persuaded to move to the designated refuge. Those who hesitate and refuse to move may be forced to do so; (4) If the dike breaches and water floods the streets, subordinates should be supervised and ordered to work hard to maintain public order and traffic in the city, and assist in rescuing refugees. Strict precautions should be taken against bandits taking the opportunity to loot, and detectives should be particularly vigilant and pay attention to investigation; (5) If water floods the streets at night, and the power plant experiences obstacles, each should purchase lanterns and candles for backup; (6) For all waterlogged areas, collapsed houses, fallen power poles, or flooded power lines, the power lines should be cut off at any time to avoid danger; (7) The registration of people affected by the disaster should be designated to be handled by the Water Police Bureau. Citizens who need boats should be instructed to register with the bureau and obtain flags; (8) For all boats needed to perform garrison duties after the disaster, the chief officers of each garrison agency and troop should hire them themselves according to the necessary number, and report the list to the headquarters for verification; (9) After the disaster, each garrison agency, troop, police service, and hired boat should report a list for verification. In Wuchang, all the dikes are leaking. The main dikes, from Qingshan to Jinkou, were originally divided into four sections for protection. In the first section, from Jinkou to Baiguan, and from Wuxian Temple to Xiaojia Wharf, the river water was subjected to a large army rushing from the top, and the dike body was washed away and about to collapse. There were many leaks in the Zhoujiazhui and Yangsiji areas, which were impossible to prevent. The second section was from Baiguan to Wutai Gate, and the water flowing from the gate was very strong. The third section was from Wutai Gate to Xiaxinhe. Cracks were found in the Wuchang Customs Wharf in the middle, and the water was higher than the old dike. The fourth section was from Xiaxinhe to Wufeng Gate. The landslide was subjected to wind and waves, and most of it collapsed. Water overflowed in the Felt Factory area. Above Qingshan, it connects to the Wuhui Dyke, which is also one of the main dikes. A week ago, it showed signs of danger. Now the water level has approached the top of the dike, and there are leaks everywhere, which are really impossible to prevent. The inside of the twelve-day-old foot began to collapse, which is a precursor to collapse. In addition, the roadbed of Xujiapeng and the Huaguotizi dike outside the second section of the main dike collapsed at the same time. The Wujin dike is also extremely dangerous. If the water level rises again, it cannot be preserved. The Provincial Flood Control Association has determined a flood control plan. If the area from above Wutai Gate to Longchuanji collapses, the river water will reach the urban area directly. The Shaihu Dike Gate should be blocked, Xiangguosi Street should be raised, the railway gap at Tongxiangmen should be blocked, the Jinshui Gate should be prevented from being flooded, the sub-dike should be rescued, and it is hoped that the urban area and various districts behind the Wufeng Dike can be preserved. If the Wufeng Dike collapses, the railway hole next to Changchun Temple should be blocked, the Boxue Academy sub-dike should be built, the Binyangmen bridge hole should be blocked, Wushengmen Street should be blocked, Changsheng Gate should be blocked, and the lateral dike should be raised. It is hoped that the Wujin Dike in front of the mountain can be preserved. If the river water rises above 53 feet, it will be beyond our ability to support it.</p>
<p>The railway track of the Pinghan Railway that was flooded was repaired on the 11th, and trains heading north could reach Yancheng directly. On the 12th, it was flooded again. The water depth along the way from Chenjiaji in Hankou to Xiaogan was three feet, and all vehicles were suspended. Traffic was interrupted again. Only one train carrying soil to Hankou from Huangpi arrived, and it was blocked by water, so it could not continue to be transported. Raising the dike body of Zhang Gong Dyke also encountered obstacles. (12th)</p>
<h3>Hubei Province: Establishment of a Disaster Relief General Association</h3>
<p>Appointed He Chengjun and others as committee members; internally divided into six groups for office work.</p>
<p>Hankou correspondence: The Jiangxiang area is suffering from severe flooding. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed various provincial authorities, instructing them on relief measures. In addition to the establishment of a Disaster Relief General Association by the Xingying (General Headquarters) to oversee the overall situation, each province will also organize its own provincial Disaster Relief General Association. At 11:00 AM on the 11th, the Hubei Provincial Government held a preparatory meeting. Chairman Zhang Qun reported on the flood situation and the provincial government's approval to distribute 100,000 yuan for emergency relief. Subsequently, the method of organizing the Disaster Relief General Association was discussed.

<h3>Qin Chuanzheng and Others: Report on Flood Situation Inspection – and Recommendations for Future Measures –</h3>
<p>Recently, the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers have both seen a surge in water levels simultaneously. The great flood of 1931 is about to repeat itself today. People across the country are deeply concerned. It is reported that Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, Fu Rulin, Chairman of the Yang (Yangtze River) Committee, and Zheng Jujing, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department of the Economic Commission, and others, inspected the water situation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. They returned to Beijing this afternoon (13th) and subsequently released a detailed inspection report and proposed future measures. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection along the Yangtze River</p>
<p>(1) On July 6th, the commission received a report from the Jianghan Engineering Bureau stating that the water level at Yidu rose sharply by about eight feet on the 5th. The water level has already exceeded the highest flood level of 1931. The downstream embankments are under extreme pressure and are likely to breach, making rescue efforts difficult. At the same time, it was learned that private dikes in Anhui and Jiangxi were collapsing one after another. Therefore, it was decided to depart the next morning with engineering personnel to inspect along the Yangtze River. (2) Left Beijing on the morning of July 7th and arrived in Wuhu at noon. The water level at this port has reached 28 feet, only about one foot from the bank. However, in the areas around Yihua Wharf and the low-lying areas in the western part of the port, the water has already reached the shore. According to a report by Magistrate Gao Wenbo of the county, efforts are being made to protect the dangerous areas near the various dikes. Chairman Liu Zhenhua had come to Wuhu two days ago to inspect. In the afternoon, a small customs launch was taken to inspect the nearby dikes. The county magistrate was supervising local people to protect the dikes and was immediately comforted. At 7:00 PM, boarded the Gonghe steamer and sailed upstream. (3) Arrived in Anqing at 9:00 AM on the morning of July 8th and went to the Anhui Provincial Government to meet Chairman Liu to discuss everything. It was learned that in recent days, Chairman Liu had inspected along the Yangtze River and personally guided flood prevention in various counties, which encouraged the local people even more. As a result, within Anhui, in addition to a few private dikes that breached due to high water levels, most of the main embankments were preserved. Director Liu Yiyan of the Construction Department was on his way to inspect the breach at the Mahua Dike. In the afternoon, Chairman Liu boarded the Anfeng warship and sailed upstream. At 8:00 PM, arrived in Dongliu County. The city wall here was quite dangerous because both the river and lake levels had risen. Chairman Liu immediately ordered Magistrate Zhang of the county to lead the gentry and people to rush to protect it overnight and gave 500 yuan at the time to prepare materials. At 11:00 PM, temporarily docked at the mouth of the Huayang River. (4) The ship departed at dawn on July 9th and arrived at the breach of the Mahua Dike in Jiangxi at 10:00 AM. Inspected the dike. The breach was about 60 zhang wide. Inside the dike was a reservoir lake with a large area. Although the Yangtze River water was pouring in and very turbulent, the residents by the lake showed few signs of disaster and were not very serious. Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi have all sent personnel to work to find ways to protect it. Fearing that the authority was not unified and it would be difficult to achieve results, we discussed the dike blocking method with Chairman Liu. Since the land is adjacent to Anhui, it was recommended that Director Liu Yiyan of the Anhui Construction Department be responsible for the dike blocking, with Yang Committee members supervising and directing. The cost will be shared by Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi as usual, and the central government will give appropriate subsidies. Thirty thousand yuan has been allocated first from the flood prevention funds to the Anhui Construction Department. At noon, we arrived at the border between Jiangxi and Anhui. Chairman Liu took another Anjie ship back to the province, and the Anfeng ship continued to send it to Jiujiang. By then it was 8:00 PM. The personnel of the Xunyang surveying team stationed by the Yang Committee were transferred to Mahua Dike to assist in everything. The water depth on the roads along the river in Jiujiang reached about two or three feet. The rivers and lakes inside were flooded. According to the report of Yan Fangtian, Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, more than 100 folk-level areas in the Poyang River area were breached. The dikes of the Jiangxi Province along the Yangtze River are also extremely dangerous and need to be suspected of three to four thousand yuan before they can be protected. The director of the bureau was immediately ordered to summon civilians and do his best to protect them and allocated 4,000 yuan from the flood prevention funds for materials. At the same time, the Jiangxi Construction Department was notified to inspect it, asking it to supervise the flood prevention affairs of the counties to avoid negligence. Since Chairman Xiong had not yet returned to the province, and it was heard that the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway was blocked by water and traffic had not resumed, at 9:30 PM at night, the Wusong wheel was changed to sail. (5) On July 10th, we sailed into Hubei Province. The main embankments along the river were still five or six feet above the river surface. Along the embankment, hundreds of workers dispatched by the Jianghan Bureau were seen implementing visit engineering. There was no breach. Arrived in Hankou at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. Director Liu Shoupeng of the Hubei Construction Department reported that the flood prevention situation in Wuchang was very Zhou. According to the report of Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau of this committee, the main embankments below Hankou are still good, but the water level in the Jianli area of Shaoshi has exceeded the flood level of 1931. Slightly, there were three or four breaches, all of which were not important. The embankments in Hubei Province have been ordered to be closely guarded by the various engineering offices and to visit each place for guidance. The current water level in Hankou has reached 49 feet, the roads have not yet been flooded, and the banks along the river are particularly strong in preventing the floods. According to this water situation, the embankments in 1931 had already collapsed, and the city of Hankou was in the center of the water. Regarding the flood prevention funds, 250,000 yuan had been allocated from the dike works account of Hubei Province under the jurisdiction of this committee, which was still sufficient for use. The bureau requested another 50,000 yuan, which was approved and allocated. The director of the bureau was ordered to effectively protect it. On this day, at 6:00 PM, we took a car to inspect along the Zhang Gong Dike. The dike surrounded the city of Hankou, and the Yangtze River water was about a zhang higher than the fields inside the dike. The dike was surrounded on all sides. The dike was the key to the safety of the city of Hankou. The Jianghan Bureau has been building and repairing it for many years and paid special attention to it. A leak was found in the eastern part of the riverside a few days ago, which has been jointly protected by the bureau, the Xingying, the Pinghan Railway Bureau, and the Hankou Municipal Government, and it is safe to say that there will be no problem. Subsequently, we received a telegram from Beijing, learning that the Yellow River water has also risen sharply. The Ice Committee meeting is about to be held, and Director Mao Yisheng will also arrive in Australia tomorrow to continue the supervision. Then, the arrangements were made, some people were left in Hankou to assist, and Zhu Ercheng, Division Shi Jun, and Xi Rong were sent to Hunan Province to inspect. Therefore, it was decided to return to Beijing the next morning. (6) At 7:00 AM on July 11th, we went to the Xingying to meet with Director Zhang Xueliang and learned that Director Zhang had taken a plane to inspect the upper reaches and told us about the flood situation in Shashi and Xianghe, which was extremely detailed. At 10:00 AM, we left Hankou on the Gonghe to return to Beijing. (7) Recently, the water has risen, and navigation has been suspended at night. It was not until the morning of July 13th that we arrived at the Wuhu Wharf and learned that the water levels in Anqing and Wuhu have not risen or fallen much, while the water level in Hankou rose sharply again at 1:00 PM on the 11th, reaching a height of 50 feet. The embankments are becoming more and more dangerous, which is very worrying. The water level in Jiujiang also rose by four inches. At the same time, we also learned that the Yellow River water has also risen sharply, and the Linyi embankment in Shandong Province has breached. The entire river embankment is under pressure. According to the Yellow River flood, the highest level is usually in early August. This time, the water level is so fierce in mid-July, which is really unexpected. We will return to Beijing today to make arrangements and urge internal personnel to intensify their work day and night during the emergency flood prevention period.</p>
<p>Current Protection</p>
<p>The magnitude of the Yangtze River's water level is not much different from that of the 1931 flood. At that time, the dikes along the river had long collapsed and could not be salvaged. This year, the main dikes along the river have been rebuilt by the National Government's Flood Relief Association, and recent protection efforts have been strong. Therefore, no major breaches have occurred. Only in places where the water level is particularly high and human power cannot be saved, the folk dikes have been flooded. However, there are indeed many embankments that have been kept safe by rescue and protection. Recently, the flood season has not passed, and the water level in the upper reaches has slightly decreased in recent days. It is inevitable that it will rise again. The following is a list of the urgent tasks currently being undertaken: (1) The provincial governments should supervise local officials and people to guard the dikes in sections and work together to protect them. If the officials can personally inspect and provide guidance, the local officials, gentry, and people will be more encouraged and enthusiastic about their work, and more dikes will be preserved. (2) For the dikes that have breached, some of which have very strong water flow and the affected area is not too wide, it seems uneconomical to immediately plug them. The water conservancy organs should immediately protect both ends of the dike to avoid further expansion. Once the water recedes and the dike foundation dries up, the dike can be restored, which will be more effective and cost less. (3) In the areas along the river that have been flooded, only the tops of thatched houses can be seen now, and the water is level with the eaves. The people who have been displaced must be numerous, and during the floods, epidemics are easy to spread. Disease prevention is also very important. The provinces should immediately provide relief in accordance with Chairman Chiang's flood relief measures. (4) The local governments should immediately send personnel to investigate the flooded areas and detailed conditions within their jurisdictions and quickly report them to the provincial governments for forwarding to the Yang Committee, so as to coordinate the planning of the Yangtze River's flood control measures.</p>
<p>Post-Flood Measures</p>
<p>The Yangtze River is the most benign river in the world, but in recent years it has become a frequent source of floods. The reasons are very complex, but the most obvious is that the lakes and swamps that used to store water, as well as the beaches and sandbars along the river, have mostly been reclaimed into farmland, competing with the water, which will inevitably lead to breaches. This is common sense. Therefore, after this year's major flood, when the water level drops, there is an urgent need to coordinate remedial measures so that flood control can be carried out before the fundamental plan for the Yangtze River has been planned and implemented. The following are listed for selection: (1) The Yang Committee shall, according to the flooding conditions in various places, plan to reserve the area of lakes and swamps for water storage. Private dikes that are directly harmful to water storage must not be repaired. Detailed measures shall be negotiated and handled by the committee and the provincial governments. (2) The Yang Committee will survey the height of the dikes along the river, plan the size of the main dikes to be raised and thickened, and negotiate with the provincial governments to order local governments to carry out small-scale repairs during the agricultural slack season. The central government will provide appropriate subsidies when necessary. (3) After the water recedes at the breach of the main dike, the Yang Committee will send technicians to guide the water conservancy organs of various provinces to repair them separately according to the needs, so that they are legal. (4) The Yang Committee will send personnel to carefully inspect and plan the Yangtze River waterway and the lakes of various tributaries and formulate a fundamental plan for phased implementation.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Area: Yangtze River Water Level Gradually Stabilizing; Provincial Government Still Orders Intensified Flood Defense</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Yangtze River water level, which had been rising sharply for half a month, has gradually stabilized in the last three days. The Wuhu Jiangchao (tidal level) fell five inches from the 10th to the 12th, with the customs water mark receding from 28 feet 6 inches to 28 feet 1 inch. The river water flowing downstream is also not as turbulent as in the previous days. Although 30 to 40 good dikes along the Anhui Province have collapsed one after another, most of them are small dikes and newly built beaches. If there is no heavy rain in the next half month or a strong surge of water from the upper reaches, the large dikes along the river will not be in danger. According to the observation of an agricultural expert, the areas north and south of the Yangtze River in Anhui Province are fertile land with abundant grain production. Although many places are currently flooded, the damage is not great because it is temporary. If there is no heavy rain or flood, a bumper harvest is expected in the autumn. The seedlings in the counties and villages are growing day by day. It is expected that the new rice will be on the market by the end of this month. The provincial government, in order to intensify flood defense, recently sent telegrams to various counties along the river, providing some instructions. The main points are as follows: (1) In the event of flooding, all efforts should be made to defend against it. The orders have been issued to follow up on all cases with speed. How is the water situation in your county now? Are there any dangerous places? Please reply immediately, step up the defense, and do not be negligent or delayed. (2) Flood prevention is an urgent matter, and cooperation is essential to achieve success. In addition to the personnel of the Water Conservancy Engineering Committee and the Dike Works Committee, all district chiefs, baojia chiefs, and strongmen's teams must be fully mobilized to maximize effectiveness. Please comply immediately. (3) During the flood prevention period, dangers often occur unintentionally. Close patrols are paramount. The orders have been issued for compliance. It is sincerely feared that the dikes have not been fully noticed. Please quickly dispatch the responsible people to inspect the dikes step by step, day and night, and report them to the responsible personnel of the dikes, and repair and protect them according to law. For households living near the dikes, they should be ordered to find out if there are any leaks inside the house and build them strong at any time. (12th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Suburbs Suffer Flooding: Mountain Torrents Arrive Suddenly Outside the Northeast and West Gates; Water Depth of Four to Five Feet, Houses Collapse and Injure People</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The suburbs of Guangzhou have suffered flooding in recent years. Last year, the Old People's Home outside the East Gate was flooded, and dozens of old people drowned inside, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy in the city. After relief efforts from all parties and research on future flood prevention measures, it was agreed that the six-pulse canal, the Jade Belt River, and the East and West Moats in the old city of Guangzhou have been silted up for many years, and flood prevention will not be possible unless they are dredged. Because the city of Guangzhou is backed by the Baiyun and Yuexiu Mountains, mountain torrents pour into the suburbs after heavy rains. If the ring city canals and moats are unblocked, they can be used to discharge the mountain torrents, and the flooding of the city should not be too great. However, the dredging of canals and moats, although once proposed, was ultimately suspended due to doubts. As time passed, the situation changed, and until July 5th of this year, the suburbs suffered a second flood. On the afternoon of that day, the weather suddenly changed, and the sky was as dark as ink. At 6:00 PM in the evening, thunderstorms struck, like the Milky Way pouring down. The torrents from the Baiyun and Yuexiu Peaks surged to the northern suburbs. As a result, the streets of the Great North Gate, such as Jiulong Street, Lianhua Well, Rongshu Lane, Tiancao Temple, and Mangguoshu Street, were flooded in an instant, with the water depth reaching the shins. The houses on the streets were flooded to two or three feet. Qiantoutou outside the East Gate was more than four feet deep, and the Old People's Home became a lake. Fortunately, the person in charge of the home had moved the elderly to a safe place in advance. Outside the Old City Base outside the Little North Gate, the water was ten feet deep. Schools and restaurants in the suburbs were flooded. In addition, the water in Xiaobeilu, Fazheng Road, Xiaoshi Street, Dashi Street, and Haoxian Road was more than five feet deep. Six houses collapsed. The Xu residence at No. 10 Xiaobei Straight Street, the Huang residence at No. 19, the Wu residence at No. 20, the Xie residence at No. 27, the Zhu residence at No. 24, and the Zeng residence at No. 25 were all damaged. Five men and women were injured in the Zeng residence, one person was injured in the Zhu residence, two men and women were injured in the Huang residence, seven men and women were injured in the Wei residence, and three people were injured in the Wu residence. A total of 26 men and women were injured in the five residences. Outside the East Suburbs, in addition to the water depth reaching the navel in Qiantoutou, the nearby Shahe was also four feet deep. The floodwater on Shahe Road reached the knees. The area around the Yantang Military and Political School was seven feet deep. The Shahe Branch hired small boats to rescue the refugees. Many houses also collapsed on Shahe Main Street that night. Mountain torrents also flooded the Xicun area outside the West Suburbs. The ground of the provincial cement plant in Xicun was two feet high. The fire in the water tank was washed down and the fire in the furnace was extinguished. Work was temporarily suspended. By the morning of the 6th, the floodwaters had receded. The plant suffered a loss of several thousand yuan. (July 6th)</p>
<h3>After the Yellow River Breach in Shandong: Han Sends Telegram Requesting Emergency Relief; Han Also Requests Disciplinary Action, Major Flood Has Passed Juancheng</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, deeply knows that the dike breach this time in Juancheng will be difficult to plug up in a short period of time once the dike collapses. He is extremely guilty for the people affected by the disaster. At the same time, the personnel in charge of river affairs are responsible for their failure to protect against the breach. He is also responsible for his failure to supervise and inspect. In addition to ordering the chief and deputy chiefs to strictly investigate and take disciplinary action, he sent a telegram to Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan, and Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Economic Commission, requesting a huge amount of money to be allocated and distributed for emergency relief to save the disaster victims. The original text is as follows: "Chengdu Committee Member Chiang, Nanjing National Government Chairman Lin, Executive Yuan President Han Junjian, National Economic Committee Chairman Song Ziwen Brother Xun Jian, Qie Huang Shui, Shandong Province, Juancheng County, Dongzhuang Linpu Collection, Dike embankment, I have already presented the overflow of various situations by Zhenri telegram, I want to invite Junjian, check the Yellow River breach in Dongming in the previous year, more than ten counties in western Shandong were submerged, the people suffered a great disaster, and their vitality has not yet recovered. Juancheng is now breached again, although I have supervised and ordered them to do their best to protect it, it is difficult to plug up the embankment. The people in the disaster areas in the previous ten or more counties will inevitably suffer another disaster. I am extremely guilty to hear the report. I presented it this spring and I was abused by the drought and the two wheat crops were poor. At present, the rain and ze have just been drenched, and I can be expected to have autumn. However, the late rice has not been planted yet, and I have suffered a deep cushion. My disaster victims, what should I do? I am wandering around the room, and my five internal organs are burning. I am responsible for comforting the people, and I cannot help but think of saving them. Only because the provincial treasury is exhausted, I am deeply ashamed of not being able to benefit from it. I respectfully ask Junzuo to overwhelm the disaster victims. I am in danger of being at the end of the day. Xun orders the allocation of suspicious items and distributes them for tight relief to save the people's lives. The root cause of this disaster is due to the fierce water of the Yellow River, and the river affairs authority is difficult to shirk its failure to protect it. I am responsible for my failure to supervise and inspect. In addition to ordering the chief and deputy chiefs to strictly investigate and take disciplinary action, please severely punish Fu Zuo and Director Zhang Lianjia of the River Affairs Bureau to warn and maintain law and discipline. At the time of the telegram, I was horrified to await orders. After the water situation, I will continue to telegram. My job is Han Fu Zuo Kou Zhenmi Shi Yin,"</p>
<p>The latest news received here on the evening of the 11th, combined with reports from long-distance calls from Juancheng and Yuncheng, stated that on the evening of the 10th, Juancheng was breached, and the water flowed in three streams. One was that the flood water exceeded the folk embankment and was sparsely flooded between Dongzhuang Linpu Jidong, and the flooded location was only more than 50 steps away from the Dongzhuang River Engineering Section. Several section workers were washed away by the flood and their whereabouts are unknown. The water was about 30 miles wide at the flood point, about 1 zhang high, and moved at a speed of 4 or 5 miles per hour. It passed Zheng Ying, south of Juancheng, on the afternoon of the 11th and arrived at Yinmaji, east of Juancheng, in the afternoon. The other two streams were caused by the breach of small folk embankments between Lishengtun and Yanglou. One stream flowed straight into Juancheng. Qin Daoyu, Magistrate of Juancheng County, led civilians and students from rural schools to block the breach with all their might, but the water was too strong and breached as it was being blocked. The water has reached Hongshankou between Juancheng and Juancheng, only 40 miles away from Yuncheng County. One stream flowed straight into Linpu Ji, and the water has reached the junction of Juancheng and Heze. The authorities are currently planning to guide the breached water into the Zhao Wang River, the Su River, and Nanwang Lake to prevent the disaster area from expanding. According to the telegram from Bai Daocun, Magistrate of Yuncheng County, on the 11th, the water flowing straight into Linpu Ji was about 8 feet deep and had reached the Li Gai area of Juancheng, with the water head being more than 2 feet high. The authorities are supervising civilians to help block the folk dike of Yinmaji in Juancheng, and also building a folk dike in sections for 50 miles from Maidougou in Yuncheng to Runshenkou to connect with the folk dike of Yinma Ji, so as to force the water from the breach into the Zhao Wang Su River and Nanwang Lake.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Drowning Death from Falling into the River while Riding a Bicycle</p>
<p>Xia Tiesheng from Zhuanqiao, who runs the Xia Yuxing tea and food store, is doing well in business. His son, Guizhang, 22 years old, was riding a bicycle from Zhuan to Xinzhuang on the afternoon of the 13th. When passing the Zhu Dianshui Bridge south of Xin Zhuang Station, he accidentally fell into the river with the bicycle and drowned at that time. After receiving the report, Dong, a patrolman from the Sixth Branch Office of the Mountain, led the police to rush to the scene and found it to be true. The body and the bicycle were fished out and placed on the bank. Just as they were preparing to order the map and township police to report to the court for inspection, Guizhang's father arrived, recognized his son, and requested permission to waive the inspection and transport him back for coffin burial. A Prisoner Extortion Discovered and Interrogated</p>
<p>Zhang Ziming, a prisoner in the county prison, is from Tinglin and was sentenced to 20 years. Zhang Shuisheng, from Shanghai, was sentenced to 18 years. Both were involved in theft cases. Their appeals to the Shanghai High Court were rejected. They are arrogant and specialize in extorting new prisoners in prison. Previously, the court authorities remotely heard cries for help in the prison and went to investigate. The victims, Zhang Baojian and Gao Fugui, were summoned and questioned by the procuratorate and sued the criminal court. On the 13th, Zhang Yihuang, the criminal court pusher, raised the court to deal with the case. According to Zhang Baojian's confession, he was extorted by Zhang Ziming, and Gao Fugui was extorted by Zhang Shuisheng. However, the defendants denied it, and claimed that the new prisoners must be checked by the guards and directors before entering the prison. They requested that the guards be summoned to court. After the question officer's debate ended, the verdict was set for the 17th.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Water Police Capture Robber Bandits on Boat</p>
<p>The First Brigade of the Zhejiang Water Police, acting on a confidential report that the ringleaders of the bandits who robbed the Shenhu-bound Jili steamboat at Zhangjiabang were hiding in Suzhou, dispatched Special Agent Hu Dongsheng to Suzhou on the 12th.  He was accompanied by four detectives and Detective Bao Zhengquan of the Second District Detective Squad of the Water Police. That night, they successively captured two bandits, a man named Lin from Yixing and a man named Bai from Wenzhou, on Dama Road outside of Lüdou and at the Xinjisheng Inn in Lerongfang. A Sichuan-made pistol and more than eighty bullets were found on Lin. They were immediately taken to the squad headquarters for interrogation. Lin and Bai confessed to having collaborated with Gu and dozens of others in robbing the Jili steamboat without denying it. They were immediately taken into custody, and the remaining accomplices are being pursued and brought to justice for interrogation.</p>
<p>Mysterious Murder Case Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>The murder case in Guanning Lane is full of strange twists and has shocked society. In addition to the seven police officers, on the 12th, the Public Security Bureau transferred the case to the local court. At the time, the First Branch Bureau Chief Yan specially sent the newspaper with bloodstained fingerprints to the capital, requesting the fingerprint expert Xia Yinquan, head of the Beijing Police Department's detective team, to analyze the fingerprints in order to compare them with the fingerprints taken from the detained police officers, hoping to find the real culprit. It is reported that the Branch Bureau Chief returned to Suzhou at noon on the 13th. The result was that the bloodstains on the newspaper were more than sixteen hours old, and the blood was dry and shrunken, and the effectiveness of the analysis had been lost, so there was no concrete proof. The focus of the case has now shifted to the court, and the Public Security Bureau's investigation of the murderer has been unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Industry Association Cables Request for Publication of the Use of Silk Improvement Fees</p>
<p>The Wuxi Cocoon Industry and Silk Factory Associations are requesting clear publication of the exact amount and use of the improvement fees collected by the Jiangsu Construction Department for this year's spring cocoons, as they have not been announced. The original telegram is as follows: "Shen Junjian, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, it is reported that the Jiangsu Province has established an Agricultural Management Committee, which has been approved by the Provincial Government Committee. The organizational regulations consist of ten articles, including Article 2, which defines the powers of the committee as (2) the guidance and improvement of the silk industry. The original Silk Industry Improvement Committee of Jiangsu Province, after the establishment of the Agricultural Management Committee, we deeply suspect, will the Silk Industry Improvement Committee still exist as before? The Silk Industry Improvement Management Committee has set up an office in Wuxi this year to supervise the collection of silk industry improvement fees, which is extremely diligent. The exact amount of improvement fees collected this spring has not been published. It is said that it is no less than 300,000 yuan. This improvement fee is entirely the lifeblood of silk and cocoon merchants. At a time when the rural economy is collapsing and the silk industry is in extreme decline, it is extremely difficult for silk and cocoon merchants to pay the improvement fee. It should be taken from the silk industry and used for the silk industry. Our association has repeatedly received inquiries from members about the exact amount collected this year and how it will be used. Therefore, we send a special telegram to report this matter, and respectfully request that the exact amount and use of the improvement fee collected this year be clearly announced to dispel public doubts and show great trust."</p>
<p>Three Major Robbers Sent to Court for Processing</p>
<p>The three major robbers You Guozhen, Xu Jinlin, and Wang Xisheng involved in the Zhang Yuchang Rice Shop robbery outside the South Gate of Huangni Bang, were sent to the County Government to be sentenced to death according to the Bandit Suppression Law, and reported to the province for approval. After the Provincial Government approved the request, it was determined that since the new criminal law had been implemented on July 1, the Bandit Suppression Law was no longer applicable. The case files and criminals should be transferred to the court to be handled in accordance with the ordinary criminal procedure. Therefore, it was ordered that Magistrate Wang of this county should comply with the instructions.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Business Tax Amount Still Under Discussion</p>
<p>The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce, in order to expedite a solution to the issue of the business tax amount collected by the Business Tax Bureau from various industries for the autumn business tax of the 24th year, specially convened representatives from various industries and the tax bureau for a discussion on the 12th. Representatives Wang Lantin from the Business Tax Bureau, and more than a dozen representatives from machine dyeing, weaving, oil mills, and colored cloth industries attended. Representatives from various industries successively stated the difficulties faced by businesses and requested that the tax bureau take these difficulties into consideration and reduce the tax amount. Representative Wang Lantin from the tax bureau expressed willingness to make concessions, but only on the principle of balancing the interests of both parties. The result was satisfactory. Also, the Department of Finance dispatched Supervisor Xu Yishou to Changzhou to urge the completion of the review work for the 24th year, which was originally limited to the end of June, but is now overdue. After Xu inquired about everything at the tax bureau, he transferred to Wuxi on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Black Hen Lays Three-Yolked Giant Egg</p>
<p>Yang Fuzhi (History and Geography teacher at Aurora College), a resident of No. 13 Tangfang Lane, Quekou Street, Xincheng, Yangzhou, has a black hen, of an ordinary breed, but rather fat. It laid a double-yolked egg once last year, and on the morning of the 12th, it laid another egg, as large as a goose egg, weighing six taels on the old scale, or about seven taels on the new scale. The owner cut it open and found that it had three yolks. The reporter and Xi Jingyuan, a reporter from the Jiangsu Provincial Newspaper in Yangzhou, both witnessed the event and recorded this anomaly.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Prosecution of Police Captain for Dereliction of Duty</p>
<p>Yan Diannan, the former captain of the Nantong County Police Force, was sentenced to ten years imprisonment by the Provincial Security Department according to military law for dereliction of duty. Subsequently, the Ministry of Military Affairs revoked the original sentence and transferred the case to the Wuxian Local Court for trial. Prosecutor Lü Wenqin believed that Yan Diannan's extortion of 1,000 yuan from Zhang Chubai and the blackmail of 550 yuan from the Dayou Jin Salt Reclamation Company constituted the crime of demanding and accepting bribes, and filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Inaugural Meeting of Foil Company</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the economic downturn, the sale of Shaoxing tin foil has been sluggish and tax revenue has fallen short. The Department of Finance has ordered the preparation of a unified control system and the organization of a special foil company in the Zhejiang provinces to provide relief. After receiving the order, foil shops promoted staff members to prepare for several months, which has now been completed. The inaugural meeting was held at the Foil Tax Bureau on the tenth. More than one hundred people attended, including preparatory committee members, sponsors, and shareholders. Li Fazhen from the Department of Finance and Zhang Luzheng from the Department of Construction attended the meeting to provide guidance. Zhou Xingbai was elected as chairman. After the meeting, Zhang Chunsheng, the promoter, reported on the preparations. Chairman Zhou Xingbai read out the company's articles of association. Then, ballots were cast, and seventeen people including Qi Baosheng, Jin Tanghou, Wang Zicheng, and Yu Shoucheng were elected as directors, and seven people including Qi Shulin and Chen Hualin were elected as supervisors. As the time was late, the election of standing directors was scheduled for a separate meeting.</p>

<p>Grand Welcome</p>
<p>Kong was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 12th, but was delayed until yesterday morning.

The Shandong Association in Shanghai also hung banners at the station welcoming the Descendant of Confucius.</p>
<p>Kong's Demeanor</p>
<p>Kong is sixteen years old and a 77th-generation descendant of Confucius. This is his first time in Shanghai, and he was accompanied by his relatives Kong Yinqiu and Kong Xiangmian. Yan Shiyong, Zeng Fanshan, and Meng Qingtang, the three officials of the Confucius Temple, were originally scheduled to travel to Shanghai together, but urgently returned to their hometowns and departed from Beijing in advance. Kong was in good spirits, with a yellow-black complexion, wearing a blue silk gown, black leather shoes, and a straw hat. After getting off the train, he thanked the welcoming personnel at the station and was escorted to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance on Rue West End to rest.</p>
<p>Statement</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Kong met with reporters in the reception room of the North Station and stated that he was deeply grateful for the warm welcome from all sectors in Beijing and Shanghai. He said that he came to Shanghai at the invitation of Minister of Finance Kong to visit various construction projects in the city and to pay respects to Mrs. Kong, and that he would also visit the newly established Ancient Music Research Institute on the sea for reference, as one is being planned in Shandong. He added that he would not stay in Shanghai for long and would return to Beijing on the overnight express train on the 14th, as the Central Military Academy had scheduled a banquet in Beijing on the 15th, which he had to attend. Kong said that this was his first visit to Beijing and Shanghai and that he had a very good impression of the south. Kong does not speak Mandarin, and his words were conveyed by his accompanying relatives.</p>
<p>Kong also issued a written statement yesterday, saying that Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of the Three Principles of the People and the idea that the world belongs to everyone, as well as Chiang Kai-shek's New Life Movement, are all good plans for saving China and revitalizing the nation, and that their origins are all from the teachings of the sages. He said that he most admired the government's respect for the sacred teachings, which allows the people's thoughts to have a center, the nation's organization to be united, and the national spirit to be restored. He also expressed his admiration for the rapid progress of construction in Nanjing, which was once a famous capital, in the few years since it became the capital, demonstrating the great strength of the national government.</p>
<p>Minister of Finance's Banquet</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi is a 75th-generation descendant of Confucius, but his family moved from Shandong to Shanxi long ago and is a descendant of the descendant of Confucius. Therefore, he specially invited Kong to visit Shanghai in his own name. Minister Kong scheduled a banquet at his private residence last night, and the Descendant of Confucius was scheduled to visit Minister Kong and his wife at the Kong residence in the afternoon. They are also scheduled to visit various places today. According to Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, who welcomed Kong at the station, the Descendant of Confucius will go to Hangzhou to visit the scenic spots of the Three Temples and Six Bridges after arriving in Shanghai.</p>

The regulations for the issuance of 3 million yuan in construction bonds in Fujian Province have been approved by the central government and have been reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan.

<h3>Xu Shiying to Depart Tomorrow to Survey Disaster, Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Relief Commission, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the night before last. He is scheduled to depart tomorrow night on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an ship to inspect the flood situation along the Yangtze River. According to Xu, he will travel along the Yangtze River from Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan to Changsha. Regarding the flood relief issue, he will temporarily allocate one million yuan from the disaster relief fund to meet immediate needs. Xu also issued a written statement as follows:</p>
<p>Rapid Rise</p>
<p>Before mid-June, various places suffered from drought, but after mid-June, continuous rain fell in the provinces along the river, and mountain floods occurred. The capacity of reservoirs and ponds in various places has been decreasing daily, resulting in insufficient discharge and rising water levels. According to reports from the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, except for Chongqing in the upper reaches, where the current water level is lower than the same period in the 20th year, the water level in all other places below Yichang is higher, and the rapid rise in the ten days since July 1 has been particularly alarming.</p>
<p>Reports of Disaster Pour In</p>
<p>The Relief Commission has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces reporting on the disaster situation. The severity of the situation is similar to the early stages of the floods in the 20th year. Fortunately, the Economic Commission, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, and the responsible agencies of the provincial and municipal governments, as well as local people, are making concerted efforts in flood prevention. President Wang, Chairman Chiang, and Vice President Kong, as well as Director Zhang of the Wuchang Provisional Headquarters, are also extremely concerned and are providing guidance at any time. Chiang has ordered precautions to be taken. The disasters have not yet fully expanded due to human intervention. However, it has been reported that 23 counties in Hunan, 12 counties in Hubei, 34 counties in Jiangxi, and Huaining and Qianshan counties in Anhui have been affected. In addition to the main stream of the Yangtze River, some areas of the Han River, Xiang River, Zi River, Yuan River, Feng River, Gan River, and Dongting and Poyang Lakes have also been flooded. Due to excessive rainfall and flash floods, 17 counties in Zhejiang Province have also reported disasters.</p>
<p>Departure for Inspection</p>
<p>Judging from the weather in recent days, the Beijing and Shanghai areas have been sunny every day, and the climate is quite normal. It may not rain in the next few days, but the water situation in the upper reaches is still worrying. On the 6th of this month, the Commission had already compiled a summary of the flood situation in various provinces and reported it to the Executive Yuan for review. At the same time, it sought detailed figures from various parties. Shi Ying himself is scheduled to travel by ship from Shanghai to the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei to inspect the situation on the 15th of this month, and to discuss relief measures with the authorities in each province. At the same time, he will urge each province to include disaster relief funds in this year's budget, and establish a management committee to actively carry out the plan, so that there will be preparations and benefits for both the central and local governments.</p>
<p>Yellow River Also Rising</p>
<p>The water level of the Yellow River has also been rising sharply in recent days. According to reports, the county seat of Yanshi has been completely submerged. In addition, provinces such as Sichuan, Guizhou, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang have also sent documents reporting heavy water and drought disasters. Due to time constraints, it is not possible to inspect everything this time. If necessary, more personnel will be sent in the future.</p>
<h3>Egg Product Subcommittee Meeting Closes Yesterday Afternoon, Liu Dongye Claims the Results Are Satisfactory</h3>
<p>The Egg Product Subcommittee meeting of the Commodity Inspection Technical Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce continued to hold its final meeting yesterday to discuss the provisional standards for egg products and fresh eggs. Because the standards adopted in various places in the past were inconsistent, the discussion at yesterday's meeting took quite a long time. The closing ceremony was held in the afternoon. The meeting started with a closing speech by Chairman Liu Dongye, who stated that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce held a conference in Beijing in the past and a meeting in Qingdao last year to improve and unify egg product inspection technology, but the results were not very satisfactory due to many difficulties. The results of this meeting are very satisfactory due to the guidance of the Ministry and the efforts of representatives from various places, and all past difficult problems have been completely resolved. It is hoped that everyone will work together in accordance with the resolutions of this meeting to live up to the Ministry's expectations. The full agenda was then read, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. After the closing ceremony, representatives from various places left Shanghai in the evening to return to their bureaus to work.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu and Brothers Donate 10,000 Yuan to Relief Flood Victims</h3>
<p>Recently, floods have plagued various places, and the disaster situation is serious. Overseas Chinese tycoons Hu Wenhu and his brother Hu Wenbao have remitted 10,000 yuan in national currency to Mayor Wu for distribution to charitable organizations. The original telegram from the Hus is as follows: "Mayor Wu, I admire you. It is reported that the rivers are rising and many places have been affected by disasters. We have just remitted 10,000 yuan in national currency through the Overseas Chinese Bank. We would like to ask you to forward it to charitable organizations for disaster relief. Hu Wenhu and Hu Wenbao."</p>
<h3>Cuban Minister Fetes Zhang Huichang Yesterday Afternoon, Zhang is Scheduled to Depart for His Post in a Few Days</h3>
<p>Cuban Minister to China, Mr. Butler, hosted a luncheon for our newly appointed Minister to Cuba, Mr. Zhang Huichang, yesterday noon, and invited Mr. Yu Ming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Zhao Tiezhang, Section Chief, to accompany him. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 2:00 PM before dispersing.

<h3>Changwang Vessels to Hold Agreement Meeting Tomorrow, Final Discussions on All Issues, Expected to be Implemented by the 22nd of This Month</h3>
<p>In order to save the Yangtze River shipping line from price competition, the six major shipping companies in Shanghai, including China Merchants, San Bei, Ning Shao, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nisshin, are planning to organize a freight pool agreement to maintain their interests. After several meetings, various measures have been drafted and finalized. A meeting is now scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 15th to discuss everything. It is expected that the agreement can be implemented on the 22nd of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Tomorrow for Final Decision</p>
<p>The freight pool agreement organized by the six companies listed above was originally scheduled to be implemented on the 8th of this month, but has been repeatedly delayed for various reasons. Nisshin Steamship Company even requested an additional 15% discount, which led to a stalemate. Nisshin Steamship Company voluntarily canceled the request, and instead proposed to increase the number of voyages. According to Mr. Yamanaka, the manager of Nisshin Steamship Company, who spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday, there was no such thing as a request for a 15% discount. All outside rumors are misunderstandings. The freight pool agreement is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th. All issues will be discussed at that time, and a final decision will be made.</p>
<p>Realization is Expected, Trial Run for Six Months</p>
<p>According to sources, it is said that it will be implemented on the 16th of this month. There is not enough time. It will probably have to be extended for another week. Nisshin's Yamanaka also said that if there are no unexpected obstacles, the agreement is expected to be implemented on the 22nd of this month. In order to facilitate the procedures, each company has appointed specialists to form a temporary organization, named YanglzeRule, and has invited accountants Xi Wangshu and Thomson to calculate the accounts. A six-month trial period has been set.</p>
<h3>Hankou Telegrams Arrive in Shanghai Several Hours Late Due to Broken Cables Near Anqing</h3>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 13th: Due to the floods, the cables of the Chinese Telegraph Bureau have been broken near Anqing. Wireless telegrams between Shanghai and Hankou are very busy for a while and cannot handle the volume. Therefore, Hankou telegrams to Shanghai are several hours late than usual.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Here to Visit Wang's Illness, Returning to Beijing in a Few Days</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, He Yingqin, Acting Chairman of the Beiping Military Council and Minister of Military Affairs, left Beijing on the night train the night before last, accompanied by his secretary, Xie Zhongyuan, secretary Li Zhiqi, and adjutant Wang Guozhong.

<h3>The Maiden Voyage of the "Mauli No. 2" Ended in Sinking at Dinghai Wharf Last Night; Incident Caused by Water Entering Through the Side Port Due to Crowds of Onlookers, Resulting in a Total Loss of Goods Worth 50,000 Yuan; Details of Whether There Were Drownings Are Unknown, But the General Bureau Dispatched Engineers and Others to Rush to the Scene Last Night for Salvage</h3>
<p>The Mauli Commercial Steamship General Bureau's newly built "Mauli No. 2" steamship, which departed from Shanghai on its maiden voyage to Taizhou on the 11th of this month, sank at the Dinghai wharf last night (the 12th). The General Bureau has entrusted the China Salvage Company to dispatch engineers and workers, who boarded the Daxing steamship last night to rush to the scene to deal with the aftermath, where the goods, worth over 50,000 yuan, were completely lost. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Maiden Voyage</p>
<p>The Mauli Steamship General Bureau, located at No. 4 Hengxin Lane, Wai Ma Road, Nanshi, Shanghai, operates the Mauli steamships on the Shanghai-Dinghai-Shipu-Haimen-Huangyan route. In order to develop the shipping industry and facilitate passenger and cargo transport between Shanghai and Taizhou, considering that the Mauli steamships were insufficient in both cabin space and tonnage, the Bureau specially ordered the "Mauli No. 2", a steel-hulled, double-bottomed express steamer, from overseas. After its construction was completed by the Sino-French Qiuxin Shipyard, it departed from Shanghai for its maiden voyage to Dinghai, Putuo, Shipu, Haimen, and Huangyan at 5:00 PM on the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Welcome at Dinghai</p>
<p>The steamship has a gross tonnage of 1,134 tons, a net tonnage of 661 tons, a length of 19.5 zhang, a width of 3 zhang, and a speed of 12 nautical miles per hour. The shipowner is Xu Yousheng, and the comprador is Shi Cantang. It arrived at the Dinghai wharf and docked at 4:00 PM on the 12th. The Dinghai branch of the Mauli Bureau prepared a large number of firecrackers and held a grand welcome ceremony on the wharf. At the same time, people from all walks of life in the area were invited to board the ship for a tour, and the visitors were very crowded. Those on board heard the sound of firecrackers and rushed to the deck on the shore side to view the welcome on the wharf.</p>
<p>Ship Capsized and Sank</p>
<p>The "Mauli No. 2" steamship, due to uneven weight distribution, began to tilt towards the shore side by 7:00 PM. Visitors rushed to escape ashore, causing the ship to tilt even further. The shipowner, Xu Yousheng, and others tried their best to find a solution, but due to the large number of visitors, they could not persuade them to move. By 7:30 PM, the ship began to take on water through an open side port in the cabin, and it capsized and sank. A great chaos broke out, and the cries for help and weeping of those trying to escape filled the air. In about 20 minutes, the steamship sank next to the wharf.</p>
<p>Reported to Shanghai by Telegraph</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Bureau received a wireless report from the steamship at 6:00 PM on the 12th stating, "Ship arrived at Dinghai at 4:00 PM." At 9:00 PM, they received a telegram from the shipowner Xu Yousheng and others, "Ship capsized at Dinghai wharf, quickly devise a plan. Xu Yousheng, Hong Ashun, Song Linhua." At 9:16 PM, they received a telegram from the comprador Shi Cantang, "Ship sank alongside wharf, but not sideways. Three decks above the water level by two feet. Send divers to Dinghai for salvage. Crew member Miao (Shuizhang) accompanying [unclear] to handle the aftermath. Shi (Cantang)." At the same time, they also received a telegram from the Haimen branch, "Rumors of ship encountering danger in Dinghai, please confirm. What is the situation?"</p>
<p>Rushing to Salvage</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram, the General Bureau Manager Miao Shuizhang learned that the "Mauli No. 2" steamship had been insured with the China Ship Insurance Association for a sum of 90,000 yuan in national currency. In addition to notifying the Association, they entrusted the China Salvage Company to salvage the ship. The Company dispatched 32 engineers, workers, and divers, accompanied by Zhou Bolun from the General Bureau, who boarded the Lian'an Shipping Company's Daxing steamship from Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon and are expected to arrive in Dinghai this morning.</p>
<p>Total Loss of Goods</p>
<p>The steamship was carrying over 2,000 pieces of flour, over 6,000 pieces of soybean cake, 500 bags of rice, 70 pieces of hemp, and about 200 pieces of miscellaneous goods from the North and South, totaling about 370 tons, with a total value of about 50,000 yuan in national currency. The aforementioned goods were loaded by various businesses in Shipu, Haimen, Huangyan, and other ports. Since Dinghai was the first port on the Shanghai-Taizhou route, it was planned that after arriving in Dinghai, the ship would sail to Shipu, Haimen, and finally Huangyan. Therefore, the goods loaded were not unloaded. After the ship sank, all the loaded goods sank with it, resulting in a great loss.</p>
<p>Drowned Passengers</p>
<p>Regarding whether there were any drowned passengers or visitors who boarded the ship, the Shanghai General Bureau repeatedly received telegrams from the crew handling the matter, but none of them mentioned it. However, a telegram from Ningbo yesterday reported that a large number of passengers and visitors, about a hundred people, had drowned. Whether this is true cannot be confirmed at this time. However, according to an employee of the General Bureau, the sinking occurred by the wharf, and it was not a matter of a few minutes, so it is unlikely that anyone drowned. The detailed situation will be clear when the Lian'an Company's Zhoushan steamship arrives in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>Crew Members Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, many family members, relatives, and friends of the crew members and passengers who remained in Shanghai went to the General Bureau at No. 4 Hengxin Lane, Wai Ma Road, Nanshi, to inquire about the situation. The Bureau immediately replied with the telegrams from the shipowner and comprador. It is reported that the Lian'an Company's Zhoushan steamship has already载载了一部分船员返回上海, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 7:00 AM this morning and dock at the Guanqiao wharf in Nanshi. The sinking of the "Mauli No. 2" is truly a new record in the shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Strict Investigation by the Central Relief Commission for the Issuance of Tax-Exempt Passports for Rice Relief</h3>
<p>In past years, disaster areas in various provinces, facing food shortages, purchased rice from outside for relief. Each provincial government would request the Central Relief Commission to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance, which would then issue tax-exempt passports for purchasing rice. It is reported that the Commission conducts extremely thorough investigations of these passports. Last year, early rice crops suffered from disasters, resulting in severe conditions. The provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu all purchased foreign rice to relieve the disaster areas, and requested the issuance of tax-exempt passports. In order to ensure prudence and to understand the quantity of rice relieved and the various circumstances of purchase, transport, and relief distribution, the Relief Commission prepared an investigation form and distributed it to the original requesting agencies. Each item had to be filled out in detail and sent back for review. The investigation form is divided into eleven sections: (1) Original requesting agency, (2) Original quantity requested in shi, (3) Distributed disaster-stricken counties and quantity in shi (each shi equal to how many kilograms or market catties), (4) Receiving agency, (5) Person in charge, (6) Purchased from which port and which merchant, (7) Quantity reported to customs (each shi equal to how many kilograms or market catties), (8) Which merchant firm handled customs declaration, (9) Transported to where, (10) Date of departure, (11) Transported by train or boat. The provisions are extremely strict.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance Requesting Exemption from Transport and Sales Tax on Local Rice Wine</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: On the 11th of this month, we received a letter from the Local Rice Wine Industry Association stating that, during the early years of the Republic of China, the local rice wine industry was at its peak, with over fifty workshops, each thriving. When the government levied a public sales tax in the fourth year of the Republic (1915), considering the special circumstances of the Shanghai region, where taxes were paid in the Chinese area but not in the foreign concessions, the Chinese area's commerce declined sharply. Commissioner Xie of the Second District Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau, recognizing the hardship, reported to the provincial bureau, which sent personnel to investigate and determine a special license, i.e., a half-tax certificate, for local rice wine in the Chinese area to be sold in the concessions. With this adjustment, the wine merchants managed to restore their businesses. For over a decade, tax revenues have increased rather than decreased. When the public sales tax was abolished and replaced with a fixed tax two years ago, it was expected that tax revenues would increase by one-quarter compared to the half-tax period. Contrary to expectations, revenues decreased by one-quarter. The reason is that, separated by a waterway, distilleries in the concessions can produce and sell wine without paying taxes, while distilleries in the Chinese area must pay eight jiao per hundred catties to sell wine in the concessions. Naturally, everyone seeks profit, so no one cares about selling wine from the Chinese area in the concessions. The number of workshops in the concessions has been increasing daily. Since the implementation of the fixed tax two years ago, more than half of the workshops in the Chinese area have closed down. If no measures are taken to relieve this situation, the future is precarious. It is undeniable that local rice wine is a subsidiary industry of farmers and is indeed a domestic product. Now that the government is actively promoting domestic products and has large-scale plans for various industries, either by raising loans or providing tax exemptions and incentives, why should our industry alone be left out? Now, our industry, recognizing that the Pubei China Alcohol Factory and the Zhabei Zhonghua Alcohol Factory, established by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and merchants, are temporarily exempted from taxes and have special stamps to show the difference when their products are sold in the Chinese area, these factories are flourishing. This approach is even better than the half-tax certificate treatment during the warlord era. Why is the current situation worse than before? The government's main goal is to promote domestic products. Our industry has the same domestic product nature and is located in the same special area. It seems that we can refer to the aforementioned approach, temporarily exempting taxes for sales within the special area to make adjustments and ensure fairness. Otherwise, our industry will be doomed. Statistics show that there are currently over twenty workshops, each employing between forty and fifty people, or twenty and thirty people, averaging close to a thousand workers. Counting their families, over ten thousand people rely on this for a living. If they are forced to close down, the suffering of displacement is unimaginable. Agriculture is the foundation of the country, and the foundation must be strong for the country to be secure. This is a teaching from the ancients. Our association pleads on behalf of the people and does not fear to repeatedly submit requests, offering our humble suggestions. We humbly request that your esteemed association forward this to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for approval, referring to the alcohol approach: local rice wine will pay taxes when sold within the Chinese area but be temporarily exempt from taxes when sold in the special area. When international negotiations are successfully concluded and the jurisdictional boundaries of the concessions are eliminated, so that all industries are treated equally and pay taxes, our industry will follow suit. This will at least allow Shanghai's local rice wine merchants to survive and not be completely wiped out. This is all thanks to the benevolence of the honorable officials. We are submitting this letter, requesting your esteemed association to review and forward it to ensure fairness and relieve the merchants' plight. These are the words that have reached the association. Upon investigation, it is found that foreign-owned alcohol factories within the concessions have not yet paid the unified tax, as evidenced by a Ministry of Finance approval. The case cited by the association, where the Pubei and Zhabei alcohol factories' products are temporarily allowed to be recorded as accounts when transported to the concessions, is because the concessions' alcohol has no tax, and this is the only way to compete. The situation with local rice wine is similar, as it is said that it is produced and sold within the concessions, but a fixed tax has not been levied. If it is allowed to develop freely, it will be difficult to manage. It is better to follow the example of inland alcohol factories recording accounts, and temporarily allow tax-free transportation for local rice wine transported from the Chinese area to the concessions. This will prevent the monopolization of profits, and it will be easier to negotiate a uniform tax in the future. This is truly a consideration for the national economy, not just for the self-interest of the wine merchants. Therefore, we are submitting this situation by telegram and requesting that your esteemed Ministry review and approve its implementation, for the sake of public convenience. [Signed] Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully."</p>

<h3>Further Request for Increased Sales of Refined Salt Currently Under Unified Research Based on Principles of Non-Coagulating Salt and Salt Tax</h3>
<p>Shiye She states, "The annual sales volume of 1.2 million dan of refined salt previously approved by the Salt Administration is insufficient for distribution among the six companies in the industry. In order to achieve a balance between production and sales, it is planned to request a further increase in the sales quota from the Salt Affairs Administration in order to maintain business operations. It is understood that the opinion of the refined salt industry is based on the principle of not hindering the coarse salt trade and the income from salt taxes. It has also been decided to make a request within the possible range at an appropriate time in order to avoid causing unnecessary disputes. This matter is currently under unified research."</p>
<h3>The Party Affairs Instructor of the Second District of Jiangsu Province Promotes the New Rural Life in Yutang Township Personnel Designated for Ten Counties to Further Promote it by District</h3>
<p>Mr. Niu Changyao, the Party Affairs Instructor of the Second District of Jiangsu Province, believes that the New Life Movement cannot be limited to local cities, and that future efforts should be directed towards the countryside. Moreover, the ten counties in the Second District are adjacent to the coast, located near the suburbs of Shanghai, and are in a crucial position in Jiangsu Province. Considering that the international situation is becoming increasingly urgent, strengthening the country and the people, and consolidating the frontier are important matters. Therefore, a plan for implementing the New Rural Life Experimental Zone in Yutang Township has been presented to the Central Government for record-keeping and implementation. Currently, the villages within a 25-square-li range of Yutang are designated as the New Life Experimental Zone, and the social education service personnel of Yutang are responsible for promoting it by district. In order to expand the area for promotion, in accordance with Article 2 of the General Principles of the Method, the following personnel have been selected from this office: Zhang Xiaoyou, Hu Naiwen, Zhang Jingye from Shanghai, Wang Zhewu from Songjiang, Wang Haoying from Jinshan, Huang Xuze from Qingpu, Zhu Ye from Fengxian, Chen Xizuo from Nanhui, Lu Shunqing from Chuansha, Lu Linxun from Jiading, Huang Baolin from Taicang, and Zhu Xuedian from Baoshan.

<h3>The Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association Held a Meeting Yesterday, Decided on the Date for Filing a Petition, and Notified all Rickshaw Owners to Hasten Their Registration</h3>
<p>Since the Public Concession's Municipal Council decided to increase the rickshaw tax, the rickshaw owners have protested, believing they cannot bear the burden. They had previously requested the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to negotiate, but the Municipal Council has yet to respond. Yesterday, the industry's Mutual Aid Association held another meeting and decided on a date for filing a petition. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Important Matters Decided</p>
<p>Those present at yesterday's meeting included Gao Youyu, Cheng Zhongdao, Ye Wenhua, Shen [unclear], and over twenty others. Ye Wenhua was elected chairman, and the agenda was as follows: 1. Report (omitted). 2. Registration among the industry has been very active in recent days (already exceeding 10,000 households). Due to the large number of people, there is concern that there may be radical actions outside that may violate the law and discipline. How should this be prevented? It was decided that (A) the Association will send personnel daily to investigate and guide at all times, and must abide by the Association's resolutions, wait quietly for negotiations to resolve the matter, and not take any action outside the guidelines; (B) the Association will issue a notice to persuade and advise. 3. The Municipal Council has not responded to the tax increase issue. How should we negotiate to urge an early resolution to reassure the industry? It was decided that (A) another letter will be sent to the Ratepayers' Association, requesting swift negotiations; (B) letters will be sent to all sectors and guilds, urging them to uphold fairness and provide assistance; (C) representatives will be elected to file a petition with the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council on a set date, requesting that they ask the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, Zhong Si, to order the Vehicle Affairs Office to stop the tax increase.</p>
<p>Notice to Rickshaw Owners</p>
<p>The Association also issued a notice to all rickshaw owners yesterday, stating: "Recently, the British Concession's Municipal Council, disregarding our hardship, has increased the rickshaw tax by 100% starting this autumn, at a time when the market is depressed and all industries are in decline. This is clearly putting the rickshaw industry to death. We have now organized a Mutual Aid Association, as a whole group, to request the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and all sectors to provide assistance in requesting the Municipal Council to cancel the decision to increase the rickshaw tax, to preserve our livelihoods and reduce our suffering. This is currently in progress. We hope that all rickshaw owners will unite, peacefully conduct their business, and wait patiently for a resolution. Do not take any action outside the guidelines that may hinder the Association's work. All those who have not yet registered should hasten to the Association's registration office at No. 4 Yongji Lane, at the intersection of Xizang Road and Avenue Edward VII. Do not hesitate to watch. This is to inform you."</p>
<h3>Cai Jinjun Inspects the Pudong Sub-Bureau</h3>
<p>The Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Cai Jinjun, accompanied by several aides, took a ferry from Dongmen Road to the Dongchang Road pier on the opposite shore at 7:00 AM yesterday to inspect the Pudong Sub-Bureau and various police stations. Director Zhang of the Sub-Bureau had met him at the pier in advance. They then took a car provided by the Pudong District Fire Brigade to the Sub-Bureau gate. Director Cai got out of the car and went inside, inspecting the various rooms separately. He paid special attention to the cleanliness of the interior. He also carefully examined the service spirit of the police officers. After the inspection, he expressed his satisfaction. He then inspected the various streets. Accompanied by Director Zhang, he first went to the Yangjing Police Station and conducted a similar inspection. He then returned to the Yangjiadu Police Station. As a result, he was satisfied with both stations. He then drove to Tangqiao for inspection and gave some instructions. He then went to the Dongjiadu pier and took the Water Patrol Team's small ferry back to the Bureau.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council's Principle for Suppressing Inferior Alcohol is Limited to Those Harmful to Health, Counterfeit Brands Can be Resolved Through Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Wine Association had previously submitted a request to the Municipal Council, stating that the market was flooded with inferior alcohol, hindering their business, and requesting the Council to suppress inferior alcohol in accordance with the methods of the French Concession authorities. They also requested that when applying for licenses, the contents of each bottle and the country of origin should be stated on the label. If the alcohol was imported in barrels and bottled in Shanghai, the bottler's name and address should be stated. If the alcohol was liquor, the alcohol content should also be stated. This matter has been repeatedly discussed in detail by the Public Concession's Defence Committee, together with the Police, Health, and Legal Departments. If the Municipal Council adopts the French Concession's method of suppressing inferior alcohol, would it conflict with the Public Concession's bylaws? Some say that if the nature of the alcohol is specified, alcohol standards must first be established. However, after they are established, how can inspections be carried out, and the procedures would be cumbersome. However, the new Chinese Criminal Code has now been implemented, and there are clear provisions for unscrupulous merchants who counterfeit brands and damage the credibility and interests of others. Therefore, the Municipal Council's Legal Department has the legal basis to file a lawsuit when such cases occur. Furthermore, if the Municipal Council approves the Foreign Wine Association's request and provides protection and assistance, how can it be handled without exceeding the scope of the Municipal Council's ordinary administration? All of the above points have been discussed in detail. According to the results of the Defence Committee's discussions, it was agreed that inferior alcohol should be suppressed, but only those harmful to health should be targeted. As for cases of counterfeit brands and sales of inferior alcohol, the wine merchants themselves have legal channels to resolve the matter. Therefore, the Association's request to add various restrictions when applying for licenses is clearly outside the scope of the Municipal Council's ordinary powers. Therefore, the request cannot be approved. It is heard that the Municipal Council's Board of Directors passed the Defence Committee's decision at a meeting the other day and sent a letter to the Association.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Orders Its Subordinates to Strictly Prohibit Yin-Yang Calendars and Asks the Concession Police to Assist in the Investigation, Confiscation, Destruction and Punishment to Warn Cunning Scoundrels</h3>
<p>Since our country implemented the Gregorian calendar, the lunar calendar has long been abolished. However, recently there have still been some unscrupulous merchants in the publishing industry who privately print these calendars for the sake of profit, misleading the public. Therefore, although there have been repeated orders and prohibitions, these [unclear] scoundrels have disobeyed in word but not in deed. Now it is again the time for printing. If they are not investigated and prohibited early, not only will the laws become waste paper, but unscrupulous merchants in the publishing industry will also be rampant. The corrupt and immoral lunar calendars will again appear on the market. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has been ordered to investigate and prohibit this. Director Cai specially issued an order to the various sub-bureaus and police stations under his jurisdiction yesterday to do so. The original order stated: "In accordance with the Municipal Government's Order No. 14601, 'In accordance with the presentation by Lu Jianqiu and others, regarding the private printing of Yin-Yang calendars in defiance of the National Government's explicit order, we request the reiteration of confiscation, destruction, and punishment to warn cunning scoundrels who are difficult to control. The original presentation is copied and sent to the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Bureau is hereby ordered to investigate and handle the matter. etc.' One copy of the original presentation is copied and sent, and all sub-bureaus and police stations are hereby ordered to comply with the investigation and prohibition.'</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council's Issuance of Public Rickshaw Driver's Licenses Ends on the Previous Period</h3>
<p>The Acting Secretary-General of the Public Concession, Fei Lipu, issued Proclamation No. 4615 yesterday, stating: "Proclamation: It is hereby proclaimed that the issuance of public rickshaw driver's licenses by the Municipal Council will end on the 21st of this month (i.e., July). This proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge."</p>
<h3>Continued News of Robbery on Wuzhen Road</h3>
<p>At 6:45 PM on the 11th of this month, Liu Yuqing, a clerk from Hongchang Qianzhuang at No. 413 Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, received account money, suspected of being silver dollars amounting to 7,000 yuan, in Zhabei.  While riding in a chartered car southward via the Xin Zha Bridge, a group of robbers dragged Liu's car to a side road east of there, robbing him of 5,000 yuan in silver dollars near the entrance of Yongshou Lane. Two robbers fled towards Zhabei via Wuzhen Road and were subsequently apprehended by the Wuzhen Road police and others, along with a pistol.  This was previously reported in the newspapers.  It is now known that one of those apprehended by the Wuzhen Road police, Zou Shuigen, along with the victim Liu Yuqing and 1,000 yuan of the stolen money, were escorted to the Xin Zha Branch Bureau.  According to Liu Yuqing, "I work as a runner for Hongchang, collecting accounts in Zhabei every day.  Unexpectedly, this time I was targeted by robbers who snatched 5,000 yuan in silver dollars south of the Xin Zha Bridge. Three people were involved, and after the robbery, they fled into Yongshou Lane, escaping through the south alley."  The rest of his statement was similar to the newspaper report.  Zou Shuigen, however, claimed, "I was actually coming out of a friend's house, thinking of going to cool off on the Wuzhen Road bridge.  Suddenly, I heard gunshots.  Since I am new to Shanghai, I didn't understand the situation, so I followed them and ran.  Unexpectedly, I was hit by two bullets, one in my right shoulder and one in my waist.  Both were only superficial wounds.  Who knew the police would arrest me and treat me like a robber?  It's a real injustice!" After examining the confessions, the examining magistrate, noting that the case involved Police Chief Hu Yao and officers such as Hu Kui of this branch bureau pursuing the robbers to the jurisdiction of the Mongol Road Police Station and capturing them, and that the victim had identified them and a pistol was found, saw no reason to doubt the account.  He therefore ordered that Zou Shuigen and the 1,000 yuan in silver dollars be transferred to the Public Security Bureau.  Although Detective Weng Peiyu of the Public Concession and Western Detective Chief Bao Dai requested that the robbers be brought back to the Concession, the examining magistrate refused, stating that the robbers dared to fire shots along the way, resisting arrest and injuring officers and pedestrians.  He instructed them to request extradition from the Public Security Bureau.  It is also known that Yu Chuntao, who was also apprehended in this case, was escorted to the Public Security Bureau by the Mongol Road Police Station on the preceding two days.  As for the injured police officer, Li Chao Kui, a bullet entered the instep of his foot, and his leather shoe was also pierced.  A pedestrian named Wu Qiyao was struck by a stray bullet in the leg. Yesterday, Inspector Luo Siwei of the Wuzhen Road Police Station visited them at Baojiang Hospital and the Chinese Red Cross, respectively. The injuries of the injured individuals were not critical, so there was no danger to their lives, and they would be able to be discharged in a few days.</p>
<h3>Lu A'da's Bestial Act</h3>
<p>Zhao Xiaomei, a young girl from Taizhou, aged fifteen, made a living by selling apples.  Yesterday morning at seven o'clock, she carried a basket of apples to the Putong Huatong Wharf to sell them.  Lu A'da, the boatman of a boat berthed at the wharf, tricked her onto the boat, pretending to buy apples. He then poled the boat to the outer side of a large steamer.  Seeing that no one was paying attention, Lu dragged Xiaomei into the cabin, pulled down her trousers, intending to rape her.  Xiaomei clung to the cabin planks, crying for help, and was pushed into the cabin by two other boatmen.  At this critical moment, fortunately, a crew member on the large steamer caught a glimpse of what was happening and reported it to the water police, who brought the plaintiff and defendant to the Customs Water Police Station for questioning.</p>

<h3>Meifeng Bank: Pessimistic About Liquidation Prospects; Uncertain When Creditors Will Recover Funds</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of Meifeng Bank and two other companies, stated today (the 13th) that the deeper he delves into the bank's affairs, the worse the situation seems.  The public still holds hope, but based on the current facts, it will apparently be shattered.  The bank's affairs are chaotic and disorganized.  Creditors are uncertain when they will be able to recover any funds. Several debts have been proven to be absolutely unrecoverable, and others will require a long time to recover.  The current situation is alarming.  Therefore, the liquidation will likely take two years or more to complete.  In the current environment, there seems to be no way to shorten the liquidation period.  However, the other two companies, especially Puyi Bank, should be liquidated sooner.  There seem to be no particular obstacles.</p>
<h3>Murder Case of Watchman:  Shen Lianfa Autopsied; Deceased's Pistol Bullets Untouched; Source of Assailant's Finger Injury Unknown</h3>
<p>Shen Lianfa, a 35-year-old Shandong native and watchman at Qingcheng Qianzhuang, No. 1589 Fushui Lane, Tianjin Road, had a verbal dispute with Wang Dongchun, a 41-year-old Haizhou native and gate watchman at No. 35 of the same lane, the night before last at around 10 PM. Wang suddenly drew a pistol and fired four shots at Shen, hitting him in the head and legs twice, causing serious injuries. Wang sustained only a slight injury to his right finger. Officers No. 1264 and No. 477 from the General Police Station responded to the scene and apprehended Wang, taking him to the police station. Shen was taken by ambulance to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly after. The body was taken to the coroner's office on Ferron Road. Detective Chief Wu Yaozu and detectives Zhu Wanjun, along with Western detectives, went to the scene to investigate. Yesterday morning, the murderer Wang Dongchun was sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoquan, presented the case and filed a public prosecution under Article 371, Paragraph 1 of the New Criminal Code, requesting an extension for further detailed investigation. Wang Dongchun confessed that he was a gate watchman residing at No. 392 Dongyouheng Road. The deceased had brought six women to an empty house in the lane on the evening of the 11th of this month for entertainment, which was seen by Sun Zhaosheng, another watchman, who expelled them all. The deceased suspected Wang of having instigated this, so he accosted him last night, leading to a dispute. Wang claimed that the deceased fired at him first, and he returned fire in self-defense. Realizing the gravity of the situation, he surrendered to the police. Witness Bai Ganting and others also provided statements. Judge Qian Hongye adjourned the hearing for one week for further questioning. Around 10 AM, Prosecutor Song Genshan from the court's prosecutor's office, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the coroner's office to examine the body. According to Western Police Chief Shi Diwen's report on the investigation, the deceased's pistol was found at the scene by the police, still in its holster, and the five bullets issued to him were untouched. Therefore, the source of the murderer's finger injury is unknown. The deceased's family members are all in their hometown, and his friends have come to claim the body. After questioning Wang Dongchun briefly, Prosecutor Song determined that the deceased Shen Lianfa, male, died from gunshot wounds sustained during his lifetime. Wang Dongchun had already been investigated by the police. The body was allowed to be claimed by his friend Ma Zaiduan after he signed a guarantee.</p>

<p>At 10 PM on the 11th, a couple claiming to be Wang Ennian, 30 years old, and his wife Feng Qiuxin, 23 years old, from Suzhou, checked into Room 15 of the Northern China Apartment at No. 431 Ximen Road, Malong Road in the French Concession with a child. The bellboy led them to the room, which cost seven silver dollars per night. On the evening of the 12th, they stayed for another night. At 0:30 PM yesterday, Wang and his wife had not gotten up, and the child was crying incessantly. The bellboy, Shang Xiufeng (30 years old, from Hebei), knocked on the door, but there was no response for a long time. Suspecting something was wrong, he tried to open the door, but it was bolted from the inside. He looked through the window and saw the man dead on the bed and the woman barely breathing. Greatly alarmed, he informed the cashier and reported to the French police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. Two empty opium boxes were found, confirming that they had committed suicide by poison. Two suicide notes were also found. The woman and child were taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment, while the man's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy. The woman succumbed to the poison shortly after arriving at Guangci Hospital. The child was temporarily left at the hospital, and the woman's body was also sent to the coroner's office to await examination by officials from the Second Special Court tomorrow. Detectives are investigating the families of the deceased.</p>
<h3>Relatives of Great China Tragedy Victims Go to Court Yesterday for Injury Examinations in Preparation for Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Great China Celluloid Factory at No. 100, Lane 1371, Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai caught fire suddenly at 8:30 PM on the 28th of last month, spreading to the adjacent Yongqing Lane. At the time, over sixty residents of the lane were killed or injured. The families of the victims organized a support association and negotiated with the factory. The day before yesterday, the families of the victims went to the factory to petition, but were stopped by the gate watchmen, leading to a conflict. As a result, the families of the victims and the police personnel were injured. The victims' families plan to file a lawsuit, and for the purposes of litigation, the legal counsel of the support association accompanied the first group of twenty-seven injured individuals to the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court yesterday morning to request injury examinations. Among them were six individuals, including Zhang Wangshi, Zhu Yanshi, Xia Lyushi, Zhang Zhengcai, Yan Zhushi, and Zhang Yushi. In addition to being burned in the fire, they were also beaten yesterday. The remaining twenty-one individuals all had fire injuries, and three of them were seriously injured. Forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan examined them one by one and filled out injury reports, which were submitted to the prosecutor's office. The examinations were completed around 11 AM.</p>
<h3>Song Xueqin Admits Li Zhen Is His Daughter; Bo Zhen Says Lawsuit Is Unnecessary; Judge Orders Song to Appear in Court for Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Song Xueqin, the director of the Shanghai office of Sun Chuanfang, the former commander of the Five-Province Allied Forces, married Bo Xuezhen, a woman from Wuxian, as his concubine in 1921. They lived in Hankou and had a daughter in 1925, named Li Zhen, who is now eleven years old. At that time, their relationship was quite good. However, in May 1931, Song began living with a prostitute surnamed Zhu, and the loving relationship of more than ten years came to an end. They divorced, and Song gave Bo 20,000 yuan for living expenses, with a signed separation agreement stating that Li Zhen would be raised by Bo. Recently, Bo felt that Song was ignoring Li Zhen altogether, and fearing future disputes, she hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Xiang Xun, and Peng Yuanxun to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court to confirm the daughter's parentage. The case had been heard once before. Yesterday morning, Judge Peng Yishi opened the Fourth Civil Division to hear the case. Song Xueqin did not appear, and his lawyer stated that Song had gone to Beiping for important matters and could not arrive today. Bo Xuezhen first stated the circumstances of the case. The defendant's lawyer argued that of the 20,000 yuan given at the time of the separation, 10,000 yuan was for Li Zhen's education and other expenses. Song is currently distributing his assets, with each of his four sons receiving 20,000 yuan and each of his four daughters receiving 10,000 yuan. Therefore, Song has not denied that Li Zhen is his daughter, and the plaintiff's lawsuit is unnecessary. Judge Peng also noted that the separation agreement stated the words "daughter Li Zhen," so her identity was already established, and there was no need for further litigation. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that the purpose of the lawsuit was not to seek anything, but to prevent disputes over inheritance after Song's death, so they filed the lawsuit. Now that the defendant does not deny paternity, they requested that the court order Song to appear in court to make a settlement record, so that Li Zhen could be recognized. The court, considering that this was a personal lawsuit, could order Song to appear in court for reconciliation. The hearing was adjourned to August 8, and Song was ordered to appear in court in person next time.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Monk Sues Luo Dingxin for Fraud; Defendant Does Not Appear at Trial; Plaintiff Says Settlement Is Possible</h3>
<p>Angxi, a monk from Jing'an Temple, recently hired lawyer Gu Yushang to file a criminal self-accusation in the First Special District Court against Luo Dingxin, a native of Hangzhou, for fraud and breach of trust. The plaintiff alleged that in December 1931, he and two other monks from the temple, Zhifa and Zhiwen, were involved in a dispute over the abbotship. The defendant took the opportunity to falsely claim that a large sum of money was needed for activities to achieve the goal, and gradually swindled the plaintiff out of 220,000 yuan in postdated checks. Later, discovering that the matter was unreliable, he was deceived and stopped payment upon maturity. The defendant also disappeared. The plaintiff considered these checks to be worthless paper and did not pursue the matter. Years later, the defendant had the audacity to sue Zhiwen, another monk, with these old checks, hoping to get lucky. The plaintiff was deeply pained by his deception and filed a self-accusation, requesting that the defendant be brought to justice and that the fifteen checks, totaling 220,000 yuan, be confiscated. After one retrial, the defendant was hiding in Hangzhou, and his address was unknown. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi resumed the hearing in the criminal court. The defendant still did not appear, nor did a lawyer appear on his behalf. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Gu, requested a postponement, stating that there was hope for a settlement in the case. Judge Jiang adjourned the hearing to July 26 for the defendant to appear in court.</p>
<h3>Wife of Geng Tai Hehe Flour Factory Owner Sues Xu Yi; Trial Concluded; Xu Says Plaintiff Is Bankrupt, Why Would He Need to Forge Documents</h3>
<p>Cheng Li Tianzhi, the wife of the owner of the Chinese Geng Tai Hehe Flour Factory, filed a lawsuit in the prosecutor's office of the local court against lawyer Xu Yi for forging documents with the intention of defrauding her of 20,000 taels in legal counsel fees, plus interest, totaling approximately 30,700 yuan. Prosecutor Li Fen investigated and determined that Xu had committed the serious crime of violating Articles 224, 234, Paragraphs 1 and 2, and 363, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code and should be severely punished in accordance with Article 74 of the same law.</p>
<p>Public Prosecution Filed</p>
<p>The case was publicly tried by Judge Tan Zhuohong on the 9th of this month. Because the case was complicated, it was not concluded, and Xu was detained pending further trial. This was reported in this newspaper. At 9 AM yesterday, Judge Tan specially opened the Tenth Court to hear the case. The plaintiff's private lawsuit representatives, lawyers Li Shirui and Yang Shaopeng, appeared in court. The defendant hired lawyer He Youqian to defend him. First, Cheng Li Tianzhi testified that she only had one seal and personally signed all contracts and other documents. Li Quanshen then testified that all procedures at the Geng Tai factory, such as</p>
<p>Money In and Out</p>
<p>had to be reviewed and signed by him. Routine procedures without financial implications were handled by the bookkeeper Lu Hongsheng and Xu Yi. Xu Yi was a relative, so he was not suspected of anything. Finally, Xu Yi testified that he only charged fees for handling cases for the Geng Tai factory, but the fees were lower than others. He was not an employee of Geng Tai. Previously, the plaintiff had another case handled by lawyer Wu Kaisheng, and the plaintiff gave lawyer Ma 5,000 yuan. He was the legal counsel, but he had</p>
<p>Not Taken a Cent</p>
<p>at all for his fees, advertising costs, etc. At that time, the plaintiff's family assets were worth 30 million, why wouldn't he try to take advantage of them? Why wait until now when things are completely different? His family is already bankrupt, why would he negotiate with the plaintiff? In fact, the plaintiff couldn't pay him, so why would he need to forge documents? Moreover, he had previously handled the plaintiff's family borrowing 60,000 yuan from someone, which has not yet been repaid. This proves that he definitely did not forge documents. He requested a detailed investigation. At this point, Prosecutor Li Fen came to the court and presented his opinion, stating that the defendant admitted that the entrustment document was</p>
<p>Written by Himself</p>
<p>When confronted with this, Cheng Li Tianzhi denied that she had entrusted him as legal counsel and denied affixing her seal. Li Quanshen also denied knowing about it. Xu Yi had worked at the Geng Tai factory for more than two years starting in 1931, handling documents and affairs. He admitted to holding the position of handling legal documents at the factory, so he had the possibility of taking the factory seal. Based on this, it can be inferred that his confession is credible and that he should be judged according to the law. The examining magistrate then ordered the start of the debate. The defendant's lawyer, He Youqian, began by stating that the Civil Code stipulates that a signature or seal on a contract</p>
<p>Has the Same Effect</p>
<p>If affixing a seal is not effective, then the pleadings submitted by the parties or lawyers to the court, which only bear a seal and no signature, would not be effective. Last year, the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant, asking him to provide a detailed list of the fees due for counsel, etc., so that they could be paid. Because the plaintiff's family is now declining, they are preemptively requesting a</p>
<p>Declaration of Innocence</p>
<p>His incidental private lawsuit is completely untenable and should be dismissed in its entirety. Finally, lawyers Li Shirui and Yang Shaopeng gave their statements one after the other. The examining magistrate, seeing that the case was clear, ordered the end of the debate and scheduled Xu Yi's sentencing for 10 AM on the 16th. Xu Yi, due to illness, requested bail in court. The examining magistrate ordered that the bail application be submitted and reviewed later. He then adjourned the case and ordered the defendant to be taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Two Watermelon Vendors "Drinking Tea" [Mediation]; Police Interference Leads to Assault; Huang Chunfa Sentenced to Ten Days of Detention</h3>
<p>Huang Chunfa, a 23-year-old native of Huzhou, is a fruit vendor. Recently, due to the hot weather, he set up a watermelon stand at the entrance of the Xixin Bridge vegetable market in the French Concession. A local named Ah Jin, who already had a watermelon stand there, saw that Huang's stand was stealing his business and stopped him from setting up his stand. Huang refused to yield and would not move, leading to a verbal dispute. Ah Jin invited Huang to "drink tea" [mediate] at the Xiafei Teahouse at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Glock Road on the morning of the 11th to resolve the matter. At the appointed time, both sides brought a large number of people, each holding wooden sticks and other weapons. Upon meeting, the two sides began fighting without asking any questions, attacking each other. While the two sides were engaged in a fierce brawl, officer No. 379, Wang Jia Yu (24 years old, from Jiangsu) of the French police station, heard the alarm on Minteyni Ying Road and rushed to the scene. At the entrance of Gui'an Lane on Glock Road, the two sides surrounded the police officer, intending to make trouble for him, and struck his shoulders with wooden sticks, tearing his uniform on the back. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the officer, realizing that he was outnumbered, fired a shot into the air and blew his whistle. Upon hearing the gunshot and whistle, the thugs scattered and fled. Officers from nearby stations rushed to the scene and helped to apprehend Huang Chunfa, seizing three wooden sticks used in the assault. He was taken to the police station and yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Dong Qiming interrogated him, and the Legal Affairs Department's lawyer, Gu Shouxi, presented the case, prosecuting him for obstructing official duties and insulting an officer. Officer No. 379 testified about the incident. After the court questioned the defendant, it sentenced Huang Chunfa in court to ten days of detention as a warning for assaulting and insulting a public official while he was performing his duties.</p>

It is said that the company needs this research because it uses many types of printing paper each year, in large quantities. In addition, the physical instrument and biological specimen testing laboratory is also equipped with precision instruments for testing. The above-mentioned instruments were directly ordered from scientific instrument manufacturing companies in Germany, England, and the United States, and are of considerable value. Most of the instruments have been installed and are starting to work.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company to Add Regular Special Buses to Shanghai-Dachang Line, Reducing Fares; Addition of Special Buses to Benefit Travelers Starting on the 16th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company, a commercial enterprise in this city, in order to develop its business and facilitate travel for passengers, has decided to reduce fares on the Shanghai-Liuhang and Shanghai-Jiading lines and add special buses and Shanghai-Dachang special buses, starting on the 16th of this month, to benefit travelers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Implementation Announcement</p>
<p>The company's board of directors, in response to passengers' requests, decided at its board meeting on the 10th of this month to reduce fares on the Shanghai-Liuhang and Shanghai-Jiading lines and add special buses. Yesterday, it issued an announcement stating: "To whom it may concern, the current Shanghai-Liuhang and Shanghai-Jiading line fares need to be adjusted. The board of directors has approved the reduction of fares and the addition of special buses between Shanghai and Dachang. The special Shanghai-Dachang bus fares will also be reduced. All will be implemented starting on July 16. At the same time, the previous round-trip ticket and coupon system will be abolished. For detailed fare tables, please obtain them from the various stations. Also, the last bus from Shanghai Station every Saturday will be extended to depart at 5:45 PM. A special bus will be added from Jiading Station on Mondays at 7:30 AM. Please take note."</p>
<p>Fare Reduction</p>
<p>The original fare was calculated at 3.6 cents per kilometer. Now, the fare has been reduced to 3 cents per kilometer. The revised Shanghai-Liuhang line fares are as follows: Shanghai to Yuqing Bridge 18 cents, Dachang 21 cents, Tang Bridge 36 cents, Gujia Town 40 cents, Liuhang 49 cents, Changdan Bridge 59 cents, Luodian 69 cents, Panjia Bridge 84 cents, Shuangcaodun 97 cents, Shugou Bridge 1.01 yuan, and Liuhang River 1.11 yuan. For the Shanghai-Jiading line, from Shanghai to Luodian, and from Luodian to Jiading on the Shanghai-Liuhang line, the company, in response to requests from passengers and the Jiading County Construction Bureau, will reduce the fare completely. However, this preferential treatment is only available for passengers traveling from Shanghai to Jiading. The company has installed a sound system that reports the newly revised fares once or twice a day.</p>
<p>Addition of Special Buses</p>
<p>According to Zhu Gusheng, the director of the company's transportation department, the company used to run buses every two hours, departing from Jiading and Liuhang simultaneously. Finding that the time interval was too long, the company changed the schedule to alternate between the two lines. Now, in response to passengers' requests, it has been decided that, starting on the 16th of this month, the last bus departing from Shanghai every Saturday will be extended to depart at 5:45 PM. One special bus will be added from Jiading and Luodian each Monday. The bus from Jiading to Shanghai will depart at 7:30 AM, and the bus from Luodian to Shanghai will depart at 6:45 AM.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Dachang Special Buses</p>

The first bus from Shanghai will depart at 7:30 AM, and the last bus will depart at 5:30 PM. The first bus from Dachang will depart at 7:00 AM, and the last bus will depart at 5:00 PM. The fare is calculated at 2.6 cents per kilometer.</p>

<h3>Its Foreign Case: Bao Defu Sentenced for False Accusation; Sentenced to One Year in Prison by the Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>Last spring, the Jiangshun Public Land Freight Company in the southern part of Fujian Road and Old Zha Road Bridge was burglarized, and silver dollars were stolen at gunpoint. Afterwards, the owner of the company, Bao Defu, suspected that the case was related to Cai Yangqi, a Chongming native who was an old clerk. He reported to the Old Zha Police Station and ordered detectives to arrest Cai and bring him to court. The results of the trial showed that there was no evidence, so Cai was released. However, after being released, Cai felt aggrieved by being implicated innocently and being detained at the Old Zha Police Station. He had been brutally beaten by Bao Tan Lang Zuyin, causing serious internal injuries and incessant hemoptysis. Unwilling to let it go, he hired lawyers such as Lu Jiazi to file a complaint with the First Special Court accusing Bao Defu of false accusation and inciting harm, and also filed a lawsuit against the police station's Bao Tan Lang Zuyin for causing harm. The case has been heard by the Special Court for no less than twenty times over a year. Because the defendant Lang Zuyin failed to appear in court, even after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country contacted the Gongbu Bureau, no concrete solution was obtained, resulting in the case being unresolved. Later, the plaintiff felt that this could not go on and requested that the part concerning Bao Defu be proceeded with first. Judge Liu has tried the case twice, and it has now been concluded. Yesterday afternoon, it was time for the sentence to be announced. The defendant Bao Defu was not present. Judge Liu Gui, who was hearing the case, took his seat in the Eighth Criminal Court and announced the verdict. The main text of the verdict read: Bao Defu is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for false accusation, and is innocent of the other parts. As for the part concerning Lang Zuyin, the court will contact the police station and verify the results after obtaining them.</p>

<h3>French Concession Rickshaw License Fee Payers Unanimously Oppose Registration of Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession Public Works Bureau issued a notice that registration of public rickshaw pullers would begin on the 4th of this month, and that all registration request forms were stipulated to be three copies per vehicle, and that batches would be handed over to license fee payers for each vehicle owner and puller to comply with, to date, ten days, 3,300 copies of these registration request forms have been issued. Each vehicle owner can only painstakingly advise rickshaw pullers to register. Each rickshaw puller would rather abandon the vehicle than register, resulting in the registration office of the Public Works Bureau being deserted. Yesterday, each rickshaw license fee payer specifically jointly requested the Public Works Bureau to withdraw the order. The original text is recorded as follows: "Presented as a joint request to stop the registration of rickshaw pullers in order to maintain the rickshaw industry and show compassion for the coolies. It has been found that when your bureau dispatched personnel to investigate the real owners of rickshaws in the South Shanghai area this spring, rumors of rickshaw registration arose, causing panic among rickshaw pullers, who left Shanghai one after another. To this day, there is a shortage of rickshaw pullers in each rickshaw company, vehicles have stopped operating, and the situation has not yet returned to normal. We are seeking relief. Suddenly, we read in the newspaper that the police department of your bureau intends to implement rickshaw puller registration from the 4th of this month, and to add thumbprint fingerprints, etc. We specially urged each vehicle owner to comply, but each vehicle owner unanimously stated that although vehicle owners and rickshaw pullers are in close proximity, the rickshaw pullers have deeply entrenched views, and would rather beg for food than register, which is almost a universal sentiment. Once rickshaw pullers are forced to register, they will inevitably abandon the vehicle and leave, directly affecting the livelihoods of the poor and indirectly hindering the business of vehicle merchants. In any case, unless rickshaw pullers voluntarily register, vehicle merchants really have no way to imagine it. Furthermore, since your bureau stipulated a quota for annual license fee payment for the South Shanghai rickshaw industry, merchants have repeatedly requested improvement and relief from the public association for various losses such as paying for new licenses, returning old licenses, and rickshaw licenses being stolen, but have not been approved. On the rickshaw puller side, they operate all day, are indiscriminately photographed by the police, brave wind, rain, cold, and heat, and try to redeem their licenses. They are already extremely miserable waiting in front of various police stations. Sometimes the redeemed license is not the one photographed, or they have a good small ticket but cannot redeem it, and when the police station finds out, they fine the rickshaw puller double the amount. Thus, ignoring the hardships of rickshaw pullers on weekdays has already made rickshaw pullers regard the police station as a long journey. This time, the registration is out of benevolence and good governance, but how can rickshaw pullers not believe it? If it is forcibly implemented, no rickshaw puller will not be frightened and run away. These are all real situations, which can be verified immediately. Merchants will certainly comply with the intentions of your bureau, but with regard to the aspects of powerlessness and inability to comply, we now jointly request that your bureau consider the hardships of merchants and carefully consider the rickshaw puller registration method, and immediately stop the process, so as to avoid causing misunderstandings and unexpected losses. The merchants are fortunate, and so is society. We respectfully present this matter to the Director-General of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, jointly presented by the rickshaw license fee payers of the French Concession: Xia Xizheng, He Qipeng, Hu Wenqing, Cui Guangyu, Zhu Jinrong, Song Fengming, Shao Wenlong, Li Pingyu, He Jinxiang, Ju Ganxin, Zhu Wansheng, Yuan Changbao, Zhu Shihuan, Xue Zengfu, Zhou Jinting, Cai Jinshan, Qiu Chunshan, Zhang Huaiyang, Song Yaokun, Yu Dajin, Zhu Zhishan, Zhou Jinyuan, Liu Huanzhang, Zhao Tianyuan, Wang Rongqing, Wang Xueliu, Yuan Dehua, and more than 230 others."</p>
<h3>Settlement of the Case of Public Bus Employees in Zhabei Beaten by Three Westerners</h3>
<p>On the 21st of last month, at approximately 7:00 PM, Public Bus No. 4936 of the Shanghai Huashang Public Bus Company was returning from the Municipal Government to the North Station when it arrived near the Kailin Paint Company on Xitiyu Road. In order to avoid pedestrians in front of the bus, the driver quickly braked and stopped the bus. At the same time, three Westerners were approaching in a private car with license number 1430 issued by the Municipal Council. They also stopped the car, which angered them. They actually beat the bus driver, Gao Sanhou, and the ticket seller, Pan Linyun, causing serious injuries. The company saw that two employees were beaten for no reason and that the bus's travel time was delayed. They sent a letter to the Public Utility Bureau and the North Station Branch Bureau to investigate the perpetrators. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. (It is said that the Public Utility Bureau approved Xing and detained the car license of the Western perpetrators.) Therefore, on the 11th of this month, the Westerners sent representatives to the general manager of the Public Bus Company to resolve the matter peacefully. However, the company believed that the perpetrators had fled, violating criminal law, and that the case had been submitted to the authorities for handling. It was inconvenient to advocate for private reconciliation. The company consulted with the representatives at the North Station Branch Bureau to seek opinions before proceeding with the resolution. It was found that the material losses of the two injuries, such as medical expenses and wages lost due to injury, were fully compensated. As for the mental losses caused by the injury, the representatives and the Sixth District Public Bus Industry Union will resolve it separately.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Amateur Wireless Society Appeals to the Government</h3>
<p>The Chinese Amateur Wireless Society is the only wireless research organization in the country that connects comrades from all over the country with amateur wireless society members from various countries to conduct practical wireless experiments. Recently, in view of the fact that our country's wireless laws and amateur research regulations have not yet been promulgated, the society has submitted a document to the Ministry of Transportation for registration and requested the promulgation of wireless amateur research regulations. On the 8th of this month, the president, Fang Ziwei, and the vice president, Zhang Rangzhi, met with the Minister of Transportation, Zhu Jialin, to explain everything. Minister Zhu promised to approve it immediately. At the same time, a document was submitted to the Ministry of Education for record. Now that the Ministry of Transportation is secretly reporting private radio stations, the society has presented various advantages and disadvantages in the document to the Ministry of Transportation, and that amateur wireless should be encouraged and maintained by the government. It is very sincere. At the same time, it published advertisements in the newspaper (Shen Bao) for three days to summon amateur research comrades across the country to work together and petition the government authorities so that amateur benefits can be guaranteed and developed. Recently, the society has received responses from comrades across the country, and letters of support have been pouring in. The society was established after the September 18th Incident. Although it has only been four years, the society has spared no effort in its work, compiling and publishing the QSP Wireless Magazine every month, promoting academics, and achieving remarkable results. More than 200 comrades from all over the country have joined the society as members. The current president and vice president are Fang Ziwei and Zhang Rangzhi, both pioneers in amateur wireless research. This time, the two men led all the remaining people to work hard to appeal to the government authorities. It is expected that the future of our "Chinese Amateur Wireless" will be able to shine a ray of dawn.</p>
<h3>The Beiqiao Town Organizes a Fire Brigade</h3>
<p>The fire-fighting equipment in Beiqiao Town, Shanghai County, is still lacking. Yesterday afternoon, the district chief, Wang Cheng, and the director of the district farmers' association, Yang Zhuoyun, specially invited local people Zheng Guozhai, Cai Mengliang, Shi Ben, Cai Xiaoliang, Zhou Jinyuan, Zhang Shushan, etc., to gather at the district office to discuss the organization of the Beiqiao Fire Brigade. Each initiator determined the donation amount, and the remaining shortfall will be raised from the outside world. It was already sunset when the meeting adjourned. The fund-raising notice is also recorded as follows: "Fire protection is a national police facility, and fire-fighting is a local autonomous undertaking. Indeed, a spark of fire, if large, is related to the public's peace, and if small, is related to the life of the whole family. This is inherently impermanent and unpredictable. Don't you see the fire at the Xiajiazhai house in Xing? Connected buildings were reduced to ashes in an instant. Scorched heads and burnt faces are hard to approach in a moment. Brewing a catastrophe in the countryside is something that a cup of water cannot stop. Learning from past events is a lesson for the future. Therefore, prevention must be strict, and preparation must be early. This is why each neighboring district has organized a fire brigade. Since Beiqiao was built by the county government, there have been numerous institutions, connected houses, and an increasing population. There is no fire protection equipment. Even if we move the firewood away from the fire and bend the chimney, there may be one omission in a hundred precautions. A spark can start a fire, and preparedness can prevent trouble. When Magistrate Pan took office, he repeatedly said this (see the minutes of the 19th District Affairs Meeting on March 25, 23rd year). After we heard the order, we were at a loss. Time flies by, and a year has passed without any unexpected disasters. We should not avoid the pursuit of perfection. Now, we are fortunate to be led by the , who has allocated a large sum of money for planning again. It is a small supplement. Although it is said that horses and dragons are bustling, it is not necessarily possible to achieve our ambitions. However, empty hands and fists can at least be better than nothing. Therefore, we are going door to door to beg, imitating the cry of a burdened man, and collecting bits and pieces to form a robe, hoping that gentlemen will help us achieve our goals. It is related to our hometown, so we do not refuse anything, large or small. It is a contribution to the country, and praise and honor await.

<h3>The Trucking Industry Requests Exemption from Third-Party Liability Insurance and Sends a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asking Them to Forward It to Argue Their Case</h3>
<p>The Trucking Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "We, the undersigned, would like to report that since the increase of the 2.5% vehicle tax last year, we have also been ordered to uniformly purchase third-party liability insurance when renewing vehicle licenses starting in the winter of the 23rd year. We have previously submitted a request to the Public Utility Bureau, stating the difficulties faced by the industry and requesting that the practice of renting out taxis be followed, with both the purchase of third-party liability insurance and the payment of a security deposit being implemented simultaneously to show fairness. However, on October 8th of the same year, we received a reply that our request was not approved. Furthermore, we have received a joint letter from dozens of vehicle companies such as Yuan Zhiji Fuxing Tongxing, stating that since the increase of the 2.5% vehicle tax, they are already unable to bear the burden. However, because it concerns government tax revenue, they have no choice but to try their best to comply. Now, after increasing the vehicle tax, we are forcing all of our fellow industries in the city to uniformly purchase third-party liability insurance (all vehicles must submit an insurance policy and insurance receipt when renewing their license). Otherwise, even if the vehicle tax is paid, the license will not be renewed. If this is the case, then each vehicle of our entire industry must, in addition to paying a vehicle tax of approximately 200 yuan per quarter, also raise an insurance fee that is double the amount of the vehicle tax (approximately 200 yuan) in order to renew the license. In this time of economic depression and extreme scarcity of passengers and goods, the income from fares of our companies is not enough to cover expenses. The income from a day of hard work is not enough to maintain the livelihoods of our employees. Therefore, companies have a tendency to be unsure of what the next day will bring. The misery of their situation cannot be described in words. Therefore, we are forced to send a letter to your chamber, requesting that you forward it to the municipal authorities and request that the relevant department cancel this mandatory insurance measure.' Based on this, the municipal authorities ordered trucking companies to uniformly purchase third-party liability insurance, and its intention was originally excellent. However, in this economic downturn, merchants and industries are struggling to survive, and the decline of the trucking industry is particularly obvious. According to the latest statistics from the affiliated association, the number of trucks in this city has decreased by 30%. At this critical moment, forcing them to bear this mandatory insurance fee, which is double the amount of the vehicle tax, is tantamount to driving our entire industry to ruin. The affiliated association has silently observed the overall trend of the industry and deeply knows that the burden of this insurance fee is beyond the ability of the industry to bear. Currently, insurance is like business, and freedom should be the principle. If forced insurance is imposed, it seems unfair in terms of law, reason, and human sentiment. Your chamber leads various industries and is currently working hard to revitalize industry and commerce. We should ask you to follow the principle of relief and argue reasonably to allow you to forward this matter to the municipal government and inform the competent authorities, earnestly requesting that they revoke this regulation that requires third-party liability insurance to be purchased before a license can be issued, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and provide relief. We are deeply grateful. Addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Using His Wife to Carry Drugs</h3>
<p>Chen Jinsheng and Li Yinmin, Chinese detectives from the Sixing Road Police Station, learned that there was a small drug-selling organization that specialized in using women to carry drugs to various places for profit. At approximately 7:00 PM the night before last, they were waiting near Oujia Road and Tangen Road. After waiting for a while, they saw two locals, Zhang Wangshi and Sun Bingsheng from Pudong, walking leisurely and talking and laughing. Zhang was holding a package. The detectives stepped forward to stop them and opened the package, finding 78 taels of a substance that looked like white sugar. There was nothing else. They ordered Zhang to quickly hand over the drugs. Knowing that she could not escape the law, she took out one tael of morphine and 200 red pills from her side, saying that the contraband was brought to Pudong by a fleeing man named Chen, who promised to pay her two yuan as a reward. Sun was searched, and no drugs were found on him. The two were arrested and taken to the police station along with the evidence, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Gongbu Bureau, described the previous situation in detail and requested an extension to investigate and arrest the principal offender. Chen and Li then reported the process. The evidence was presented for inspection and questioned by the two defendants, whose statements were evasive. Judge Wu ordered that they be returned to detention separately for further verification at a later date.</p>
<h3>Han Genfu Rescued After Attempting Suicide</h3>
<p>Han Genfu, a 30-year-old Ningbo native, lived at No. 591, Kunming Road, Tangshan Road, Hongkou. At the end of December last year, he was arrested for opening a swallow's nest for people to smoke opium and sentenced to seven months in prison. He was only released on the 7th of this month. After returning home, he saw that his wife, Lin, was quite cold to him and that she was several months pregnant. He became suspicious and they quarreled with each other. Lin tried her best to defend herself, but to no avail. They agreed to commit suicide together by jumping into the river. At about 10:00 AM yesterday, they went to the outside of the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession. Han first jumped into the river, but Lin suddenly realized that suicide was not the best way to prove her innocence, so she did not follow him. Han was soon rescued by Ding Jigui, a boatman from No. 626, and sent to the Customs Water Police Station. After questioning him about the details, he was also criticized for his mistake of taking his own life. Police officer Wang Haiquan was sent to bring his wife, Lin Xiaoyue, to take her husband back.</p>
<h3>Rice Store in Xietu Road, Nanshi Robbed</h3>
<p>At 9:15 PM the night before last, the Huafeng Rice Store at No. 211 Xietu Road, Judan Road, Nanshi, was suddenly visited by four robbers. One robber was wearing a black Xiangyunsha shirt and pants, while the others were wearing blue and white cloth shirts and pants. They spoke with a local accent. One robber was watching the door, while the other three jumped over the counter into the store. They shouted to scare the staff and ordered them not to make a sound. They watched them in a corner, then took away 16 yuan in paper money, more than 10 yuan in corner tickets, and more than 100 corner coins from the counter. They fled towards Xietu Road, firing a shot as they left. Fortunately, no one was injured. When the police on duty at the location learned of this, they rushed to pursue them, but they were gone. The Ximen Branch Bureau reported the incident, and Branch Chief Li immediately ordered the detective team leader Shen Wenda to send detectives 　Wen Guang and Jiao Baojun to investigate for a week.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shenbao:</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you that our company has been engaged in the export of grass hats for 30 years. Our annual turnover is very large. We have made great efforts to promote domestic products and maintain small rural industries. Unfortunately, we often find it difficult to obtain raw materials for knitting hats. Except for some suitable products in the Ningbo area, we have to rely on foreign countries for everything else. We are unable to use all domestic products, which is always a regret. Our country has vast land and abundant resources. There must be many places in the mainland that produce them. However, because Chinese people are not good at publicity, we have no way of knowing anything other than the nearby areas. Therefore, our company intends to widely solicit information on the place of origin and procurement methods of raw materials for weaving straw hats (excluding wheat straw and mat grass). If anyone knows, we would be very grateful for their guidance. Please publish this in the Letters to the Editor column, so that it can reach remote areas. We are very grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Chuan Qilin of Kunhe Huahang</p>
<p>July 12th</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you because I read the article "Disturbance in the Auditorium of Hangzhou Restaurant" in the Local News column of your newspaper on July 11th, and I was very surprised. I have found that Zhi Liang was introduced by Mr. Zhang Junkang to be the adopted son of Ding Quanlin, but the adoption procedure has not been completed. Later, he cohabited with Ding's younger sister, Ding Zhizhen, but the marriage ceremony was not held. Later, due to disagreements, on November 28th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, both parties agreed to sign a document to terminate the cohabitation relationship, each holding it as proof, and a statement was published in the newspaper. Zhi Liang and Ding's younger sister have no relationship at all, let alone the name of husband and wife. This is the first point. Furthermore, after the Hangzhou Restaurant incident, the police sent detectives to the scene to suppress it and took the parties involved to the police station to inquire about the whole story. Since Zhi Liang and Ding's younger sister had long ago signed a document to terminate their cohabitation, there was no husband-wife relationship at all. Zhi Liang was instructed to file a lawsuit with the court. The report said that Zhi Liang's relatives jointly guaranteed his release, which is not true. This is the second point. Also, Zhi Liang has served the public group for many years, and this year he is the secretary of the Sutra Opera Research Association of Sutan and the director of education of the First Literacy School. The statement that he sang Sutra Opera and new dramas is completely inconsistent with the facts. This is the third point. Furthermore, since Zhi Liang has no father-son relationship with Ding Quanlin and no husband-wife relationship with Ding's younger sister, he naturally has no uncle-nephew or aunt-niece relationship with Zhao Peilan. This is the fourth point. As for Ding's younger sister's prior distribution of leaflets, fabricating facts, defaming her reputation, and obstructing personal freedom, she has entrusted lawyers Wang Liwu and Lv Xiehua to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. Regarding the above points, please correct them immediately in your newspaper in order to correct the audience and maintain reputation. I am very grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cheng Zhiliang</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I am writing to you after reading the article in your newspaper on the 3rd of this month about Huang Xiancheng, a student studying in France, who created a strange travel cabinet, and it was said that the style can be changed to hundreds of kinds, which is very surprising. It also said that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce did not allow the registration of patents, resulting in no power to proceed, and now it is willing to raise shares for cooperation. I do not know where Mr. Huang is currently living, so please tell me so that my friend can go to consult. If the cabinet is exquisite and ingenious, my friend is willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mu Zixiang</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I am writing to you on behalf of Ms. Lu Meifang and her legal representative, Lu Xiaodi, who stated that they were horrified to read in the News column of your newspaper on the 12th of this month that Chen Mouguang had filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court against university student Sun Enpei, Zhou Mou Song, and others for enticing her daughter Meilin and endangering public morals. It was reported that it involved the minor daughter Meifang. Although Meifang is a dancer at the Follies Hotel, she has always been chaste and knows how to love herself. She always returns home after dancing every night and has never stayed out overnight. Meifang does not know who Shen Saixiang and Fu Meilin, who were mentioned in the report, are. Since the matter is not a fact, there is no such thing as being named in the lawsuit. The situation is obviously a trick by villains, and there are other attempts. In addition to strict investigation, the report is inconsistent with the reputation and life of the minor daughter, and it should be corrected in the News column of your newspaper in order to respect the facts and correct the hearing.</p>
<p>Entrusted by the above, I, the lawyer, hereby write to you requesting investigation and correction. I am very grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhou Peishu</p>
<p>July 13th</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I am writing to you on behalf of the executives of the fire victims' association of Yongqing Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, who stated that the news column of your newspaper today contained the news that "The Great China Tragedy Dispute Has Not Ended, Thousands of Women Went to Negotiate Yesterday", which is not true. It was found that the Great China Saiz Luo Factory suddenly caught fire in the warehouse of explosive raw materials at around 8:00 PM on the 28th of last month, burning more than 20 houses in Yongqing Lane, burning 26 people to death and injuring 55 people. The disaster victims filed serious negotiations, but the factory ignored them and planned to move the factory's wealth, goods, and raw materials for days. The victims repeatedly sent representatives to the factory to request that the goods not be moved until the compensation issue was resolved. Yesterday morning, the factory actually used several large cars and dozens of workers to move the goods. The disaster victims tried to stop them, but the factory owners Zhu Rutang and Qian Menglin ordered the workers they led to beat the family members, punching and kicking them, and hitting them with sticks like rain. The disaster victims were bleeding from their heads and were covered with injuries, totaling more than 19 people. The factory then reported to the police, accusing them of sabotage. I have been specially entrusted to write to you requesting correction.</p>
<p>Based on this, I am passing on the hope that you will investigate the letter and publish a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Tao Gan</p>
<p>July 13th</p>
<p>Thank You:</p>
<p>Thank you for the Hu Biao Yong'an Hall's gift of Bagua Dan, Golden Oil, and other medicines, as well as twenty round fans.</p>

<h3>Promulgation of National Martial Arts Rules for the National Games (1)</h3>
<p>The rules of the National Martial Arts Competition of the Sixth National Games have been reviewed, revised and promulgated by the Competition Committee. In the future, it will be submitted to the Organizing Committee for approval. The drafting of this rule is based on the rules of the previous National Games, and at the same time, it adopts the opinions of the head of the National Martial Arts Section and several martial arts experts, and refers to the principles of general competition methods, and integrates them. It has been formed through initial drafts, research, deliberation, and repeated revisions. The draft has been changed many times in the middle before being submitted to the Competition Committee for review and approval. It has taken more than 70 hours. In terms of content, it can be called relatively complete.</p>
<p>The biggest change in this year's rules is that both boxing and weapons have been changed to performance competitions. According to the level of performance skills, the ranking of each person is judged. In recent times, martial arts experts have many different opinions. Some advocate competition, and some advocate performance. In fact, both methods are reasonable and have their own advantages. The National Games, in view of the provincial and municipal martial arts halls in various provinces and cities, have provincial and municipal examinations, and the central government has national examinations, all of which use competition methods to produce names and cultivate martial arts ethics. Therefore, this conference specially changed the two competitions to performances, so that the two methods can complement each other, which is not bad. Wrestling, archery, projectiles, shuttlecock kicking, and strength measurement, etc., all follow the old ones and use competition to determine the winner. However, the methods have been greatly changed and are more concrete and scientific than the rules of the previous session. The full text of the rules is nine chapters and forty-one articles.</p>
<p>Because of the change in the competition rules of this National Games, martial arts has been changed to one of the ordinary championships, and no longer a general championship. Therefore, the previous boxing championship, weapons championship, etc., have become one of today's events. The total number of events is 15 in the men's division and 11 in the women's division. Each event records 6 each or 6 pairs (boxing has paired boxing, and weapons also have paired weapons). They are scored at 754321, and the ranking is judged according to the total score obtained by each unit. This is also a major change in this year's rules. In addition to the wrestling and side-force events in the men's division, each is divided into heavy, middle, and light weight classes according to weight. In addition to fairness, the remaining events are generally not divided into classes. The grading standards for the above two events have also been revised. In addition, the abstract method of evaluating results for archery and projectiles and judging the ranking is now deleted and replaced with other reasonable methods. For example, the strength measurement competition also has concrete measures included in this session. Looking at the full text, the organization is clear and can be seen at a glance. However, the method used to compete for the top six places out of eight people after the wrestling elimination competition reaches the semi-finals and the week after is relatively complicated. The full text of the rules is recorded below.</p>

However, if a competitor registers to participate in a lighter division, and the registrar verifies before the competition that the competitor should belong to a heavier division, the competitor will lose his qualification, unless the unit does not have enough registered competitors in the heavier division, in which case the competitor may be allowed to move up to the heavier division.</p>
<p>Article 10: Athlete Quota</p>
<p>Each unit can enter up to four people in each event in both the men's and women's divisions (four pairs for pair events). Each athlete can enter up to four events. Pair events are also counted as one event.</p>

<p>Six places or six pairs are awarded for each event. Their scores are calculated as 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The ranking of each unit in the men's national martial arts championship is determined by the total score obtained in the fifteen events in that division.

<p>Article 12: Forfeiture</p>
<p>Failure to appear at the venue after the prescribed competition time will be considered a forfeiture. If the competition is a match-up, then when one competitor forfeits, his opponent will be deemed to have won.</p>
<p>Article 13: Athlete Management Regulations</p>
<p>(1) Athletes scheduled to compete should gather at the competition venue twenty minutes before the competition.</p>

<p>Boxing and weapons competitions use the quality of performance as a method to determine the rankings. Boxing performances, whether individual or pair, are limited to one set each time. The content of the performance is up to each person to choose, regardless of sect.</p>
<p>Weapons performances, whether individual or pair, are limited to one set each time. The weapons used are limited to swords, sabers, spears, and staffs. However, during a pair performance, both sides are not limited to using the same weapons.</p>

<p>Article 15: Time Limit</p>

<p>During the performance, the referees will give the appropriate scores based on subjective judgment, according to the seven methods. Then, the scores evaluated by the referees in charge of this competition will be averaged. The winner of the preliminary or semi-final, and the ranking of the final, will be determined according to the average score.</p>
<p>Article 17: Preliminary and Final Rounds</p>
<p>Boxing and weapons competitions, whether individual or pair, use the group preliminary round method to eliminate some of them, and then hold the final round. If there are too many people, a semi-final may be held after the preliminary round. The grouping will be determined by the Martial Arts Division based on the participation of each unit. Each group is based on six to ten people, and the principle is to allocate athletes from each unit into different groups. The number of places to be admitted in each group in the preliminary or semi-final will be determined by the Martial Arts Division based on the number of people in each group. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Yenching Tennis Team Lost to the Chinese Association Yesterday, Winning Only One Doubles Set Out of Four</h3>
<p>The Peiping Yenching-Tsinghua Tennis Team is composed of tennis players from Yenching and Tsinghua Universities. Taking advantage of the summer vacation, they made a southern tour. Yesterday, they made their first appearance in Shanghai, playing against the Chinese Tennis Association at the Singapore Road Chinese Tennis Association venue. There were a total of two singles and two doubles sets. As a result, Yenching-Tsinghua only won one doubles set, with a score of three to one. After the competition, Mrs. Wu Xingya presented the awards, and the event dispersed. The results of the competition are as follows:</p>
<p>The first three sets were all one-sided. The Luo brothers have already achieved extraordinary results, but they are no match for top players in Shanghai such as Lin Baohua. Lin Baohua's sixth game against Luo Xiaojian was a gift from Lin. Zhang Dingzhao's long shots often caused Luo Xiaochao to touch the net. The Luo brothers played better in doubles and had some admirable qualities. The two gentlemen are young and have a promising future. As for Lin Zhu's victory over Qiu Xu, Xu Demin's performance was so poor that there was nothing to add. He touched the net almost nineteen times. In the last game, he made double faults on his serve, three times in a row, causing Qiu Feihai to be unable to clap with one hand. Lin and Zhu served very well, and their net play was well-researched.</p>

<h3>Introducing Baseball Star Liu Laizhang, Currently a Pitcher for the Japanese Hosei University Team</h3>
<p>Our country's baseball level is very immature. Recently, the confrontation between St. John's, Nanyang, and Soochow Universities was mediocre, and there were few spectators, which is lamentable. Yesterday afternoon, a fierce baseball battle at Hongkou Park resulted in Hosei University of Japan defeating the Shanghai Amateur Team by a score of 15 to 4. Who was the Hosei pitcher? He was radiant, famous throughout the three islands, our Chinese descendant Liu Laizhang. Mr. Liu is a Cantonese and studied at Yokohama Datong Primary School from a young age, mastering this skill. Later, he entered Makimoto Middle School and suddenly revealed his talent. After entering Hosei University, his reputation greatly increased. The entire Japanese nation knows of "Mr. Liu." Recently, in the Tokyo Big Six Baseball League Championship, Hosei University won the championship, and Mr. Liu was the pitcher. On the other hand, in our country, few people know about it. Mr. Liu is of a gentle nature, eager to learn, and has no arrogant airs of an athlete. He is only twenty-four years old, and his future is limitless. Therefore, I would like to introduce him to the people of the country.</p>

<h3>Sea Bathing Event to be Held in Gaoqiao Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government-run Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach and the Guangdong Swimming Team are jointly organizing a sea bathing event to promote water sports. Since it was decided to hold the event today (August 14th) at the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach, more than 2,000 people from all walks of life have requested to participate. However, the association only has one rented ferry, which cannot accommodate everyone, which is regrettable. Therefore, they have to ask them to take the municipal ferry to the beach. Starting from 7:00 AM, there will be a ferry every hour, and four newly completed No. 6 ferries will be added to the service. Therefore, there will be a total of six ferries, which should be able to handle the crowd. There is no need to worry about crowding, but there will be more tourists in the afternoon. It is best to go in the morning, which will be more comfortable. It is reported that the performance program today, in addition to the Guangdong team members freely performing various swimming styles, the most exciting event is the one-mile sea crossing performance. This event is very long and takes a long time. Only those who are proficient in this field can be competent. Therefore, the team carefully selected members to take on the task. In addition, Happiness Company will also provide tourists with free trial use of Luohan clothing at the beach today to add to the fun.</p>

<h3>Elementary and Middle Schools in the City Should Fulfill Scout Registration - City Education Bureau Specifically Orders All Schools to Comply</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Education Bureau instructed public and private junior high schools and elementary schools, saying that the bureau investigated that at the joint athletic meeting of elementary schools held in the eighth district this year, the scouts of Zhenru Experimental Middle School and Elementary School abandoned their duties, disturbed the order of the meeting, and had no discipline. The China Scout Association Shanghai Special City Council was informed to severely punish the matter. Subsequently, a reply was received stating, "After sending personnel to investigate, it was found that the scouts of the middle school and elementary school of Zhenru Experimental School have not fulfilled their registration, and legally do not have scout membership. The coaches in charge have also not registered and passed as service members. Our association has no right to punish them. It has been found that your bureau stipulates that scout uniforms should be used as school uniforms for all schools in the city, causing the uniforms of genuine scouts and students to be the same, making it difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, in order to avoid similar situations from happening in the future, our association believes that your bureau should issue a notice to all schools in the city that use scout uniforms as school uniforms to implement training and register, and training personnel must also register with our association and obtain service member qualifications before they can be in charge. Then our association can be supervised in accordance with legal regulations." In addition, the bureau announced the Shanghai Primary and Secondary School Student Uniform Unification Method, stipulating that the classes of junior high school students and graduates who implement scout training should use scout uniforms as uniforms. All schools should earnestly implement scout training and register in accordance with the regulations, and hire registered and qualified personnel as coaches to command. In addition to ordering Zhenru Experimental Middle School to earnestly comply, all junior high schools and elementary schools in the city that have not completed scout registration procedures and whose hired coaches have not registered and passed, should complete these procedures immediately. Do not delay. This order must be followed.</p>

<h3>Ministries of Industry and Education to Begin Second Phase of Work on Labor Education Experimental Zone</h3>
<p>Based on the Labor Education Design Committee's resolution to designate five locations to establish labor education experimental zones, the Ministries of Industry and Education sent two section chiefs to Wuxi and Shanghai last year to conduct investigations and provide guidance. The labor education experimental zones in Shanghai and Wuxi have been established one after another, and the Ministries of Industry and Education have jointly hired Pan Gongzhan, et al. (Shanghai), Gao Jian Si, et al. (Wuxi) to establish labor education experimental guidance committees in Shanghai and Wuxi respectively, in order to carry out labor education in each area. In addition to these one locations, according to the original plan of the Design Committee and the two ministries, labor education experimental zones must also be established in Qingdao, Tianjin, and Hankou. It has recently been heard that as a result of consultations between representatives of the Ministries of Industry and Education, the relevant department heads of the two ministries first sent official letters to the education bureaus and social affairs bureaus of Qingdao, Tianjin, and Hankou to investigate whether these areas already have a foundation in labor education, and whether there are any difficulties in establishing experimental zones. The Industry Ministry is currently drafting the communication and investigation. After receiving a reply, the two ministries will send personnel to guide the establishment of the labor education experimental zones, depending on the situation.</p>

<p>Qiaoguang Middle School writes: "To the esteemed editor: We have read the education news disclosed in your newspaper on July 8th (note: this article was sent and published by the Shanghai branch), which mentions that our school's normal school department has had its registration revoked due to the examination. Our school has not yet received any notice from the Education Bureau regarding this matter. Moreover, our school's normal school department had already received a notice from the Education Bureau to cease operations due to the Ministry of Education's regulations that private schools cannot establish normal school departments. Therefore, the evaluation results announced by the Education Bureau this time do not correspond to the facts. In addition to formally requesting the Education Bureau to investigate and correct this, we respectfully request that you correct the above situation in your newspaper's education column to restore the facts and maintain the school's reputation."</p>

<h3>Etiquette (Short Lecture Platform)</h3>
<p>— Kang Jianzhai</p>
<p>We Chinese, have historically called ourselves a nation of propriety and righteousness. Now, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is promoting the New Life Movement, and the first thing he emphasizes is this word "etiquette."</p>
<p>Humans are educated animals. Having received education, one must understand etiquette. A person who does not understand etiquette, even if talented, will not be able to do well in society. A nation that does not value propriety and righteousness, even if wealthy and powerful, cannot maintain world peace.</p>
<p>Three thousand years ago, we had an ancient poem: "Look at the rat, it has skin; a man without etiquette. A man without etiquette, why not die quickly!" To put it in modern language, it means: "Look, even rats have fur and skin, how can a person be without etiquette? If a person has no etiquette, why not hasten their own death!"</p>
<p>Why does a lack of etiquette lead to death? Confucius said, "Valor without etiquette leads to chaos." Individual treason and rebellion, national invasion of the weak, and a one-sided pursuit of military strength – such individuals and such nations will either commit suicide or be killed in the end. Isn't that hastening one's own death?</p>
<p>These words are too broad. Here, we will only discuss from the perspective of the individual: what is called etiquette?</p>
<p>To understand the etiquette of being a person, one must learn good manners. To have good manners, one must possess three inner elements: "harmony," "humility," and "sincerity."</p>
<p>To put it simply: everyone must treat each other with love, affection, and sincerity. With sincerity inside, good manners will naturally be displayed on the outside. (Current Affairs Research)</p>
<h3>The Great Flood is Here Again (Current Affairs Research)</h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Children, the great flood is here again! These past few days, the newspapers have been reporting every day: Hankou, Nanjing, Anhui, Jiangxi, Kaifeng, and Guangzhou are all experiencing severe floods. Some villages have been completely washed away by the flood, and in some cities, the water has already entered the streets. Who would have thought that just four years after the great flood of 1931, it would happen again!</p>
<p>Recalling the flood that year, sixteen provinces were affected, and the loss of property and lives was immeasurable. Are we, the Chinese people, going to suffer again this year?</p>
<p>Some people say, "This is a natural disaster. Heaven wants us to suffer, and there's nothing we can do about it." But, children, we must think about it: Is this really something we can't do anything about? We must know that European and American countries used to experience frequent floods as well, but later they used science to dredge rivers and increase forests, and in recent years, we haven't heard much about floods. However, in China, just during the Qing Dynasty, there were more than two hundred major floods. Since the founding of the Republic, there have been three or four major floods, and even more minor floods. Is this because there's nothing we can do, or because we're unwilling to find a solution and unwilling to implement good solutions?</p>
<p>The severity of floods surpasses that of fires by tens of thousands of times. Please see the following account:</p>
<p>"In Wuyuan (a county in Anhui Province), on the 25th and 27th, it rained torrentially day and night. The mountain floods burst forth, as if the earth had cracked and the mountains had collapsed. Water shot straight up from the ground for tens of feet, and white waves chased each other like columns of silver reaching for the sky. Large rocks and logs from the mountains rushed down with the water, and in the blink of an eye, hundreds of miles of farmland were piled high with sand and stones. Corpses floated here and there in the waves. The entire county was a vast expanse of water, completely transformed into a water kingdom..."</p>
<p>Children, after reading this account, how do you feel?</p>
<p>Children, in this era of great disaster, I believe we should do the following things: (1) Research the causes of floods and methods of prevention. (2) Save your candy money to help the refugees. (3) Prepare to participate in fundraising and disaster relief efforts.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<h3>Summer Clothes (Common Sense)</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon, Min'er and Cong'er went for a walk on the street. They saw everyone on the street wearing white clothes. Min'er was very curious and asked his brother Cong'er, "Why are they all wearing white clothes now?" Cong'er replied, "Min'er, it's because the weather is very hot in the summer. White clothes can reflect sunlight, while black clothes can absorb sunlight. It's cooler to wear white clothes." Min'er asked doubtfully, "Brother Cong, I don't quite believe it. Can you demonstrate it for me?" Cong'er said, "Min'er, if you don't believe it, I'll demonstrate it for you when we get home." Min'er, hearing about the demonstration, didn't want to see anything else and kept urging his brother to go home quickly. Cong'er said, "Min'er, it's still early. Why are you in such a hurry to go home?" Min'er said, "Brother Cong, I'm in a hurry to go home so I can see your demonstration!" Cong'er said, "I see. Then let me buy some supplies for the demonstration." As he spoke, he reached into his pocket and bought five copper coins worth of ice cream on Bingtan Street, and then hurried home with his brother.</p>
<p>Soon, they arrived home. Cong'er prepared a piece of white cloth and a piece of black cloth. Min'er looked at the two pieces of ice cream they had just bought and didn't understand. He asked his brother again, "What are these things for?" Cong'er replied to his brother, "Just watch and you'll know." Cong'er wrapped a piece of ice cream in the white cloth and a piece of ice cream in the black cloth and put them in the sun. Soon, the ice cream wrapped in the black cloth melted quickly, while the ice cream wrapped in the white cloth melted very slowly. Cong'er said, "Min'er, now you know. Wearing white clothes in the summer reflects sunlight and reduces heat, while wearing black clothes in the winter absorbs sunlight, so you feel warmer."</p>
<h3>The Plain and the Mountain (Fable)</h3>
<p>— Gong Wang</p>
<p>The plain said to the mountain, "Sir, may I ask, what use are you in the world? I see your bare head and your high brow reaching into the clouds, and I have never seen your purpose..."</p>
<p>The mountain said, "Sir, then please tell me, what use are you?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know my use? Don't you see that I produce grains, sugar, wheat, etc. to supply people's needs? Countless cattle and sheep eat the green grass that grows on my chest. Rain falls on me, and large rivers and small streams come to moisten me. People store my products, and boats can travel across the rivers to all corners of the world. How can you say I have no use?"</p>
<p>The mountain said, "Sir, I won't argue with you, but you cannot do without me. Every blade of grass and every leaf of yours needs my water to irrigate it. Without me, the large rivers and small streams would dry up, and the flowers and trees would not be able to survive. You would become a desert..."</p>
<h3>Children's Science Lecture: The Flower of a Plant</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>The flower is an important part of the plant, and the flower of a flowering plant is even more so, it is its lifeline. If there were no flowers, it would never reproduce. A flower, as we see it, seems to be very simple. Some children like it very much and pluck it off, but in the plant itself, it is losing a part of its life. Each flower can be roughly divided into four parts (Figure 1). The names of the four parts are: calyx, corolla, stamen, pistil. The calyx is green and is the outermost part of the corolla. Its shape is varied, some like tubes, some like funnels, some like lips, and some like pots (Figure 2). It mostly falls off when flowering, but some fall off at the same time as the corolla. It protects the flower buds. The shape of the corolla is even more varied, depending on the type of plant. There are bell shapes, lip shapes, tongue shapes, wing shapes, and butterfly shapes (Figure 3). Inside the corolla, there are slender filaments with anthers at the upper end, called stamens. There are many stamens. Surrounded by many stamens, there is a thicker style with an ovary at the lower end, a stigma at the upper end, and ovules in the middle (Figure 4). When the ovules in this stigma combine with the pollen on the upper end of the pistil, fruits will be produced, and fruits are the lifeline of plant reproduction. This combination of pollen and ovules is sometimes aided by insects, such as peach blossoms, plum blossoms, and pear blossoms. These flowers have colors and fragrances, and also secrete nectar to attract insects to transmit pollen for them and produce fruit. Such flowers are called entomophilous flowers (Figure 5). Another type of flower uses wind power to spread pollen. They have no color, no fragrance, and no sweetness, so insects will not gather pollen. Examples of such flowers include rice, wheat, and dandelions. These are called anemophilous flowers (Figure 6).</p>
<h3>How to Organize a Summer Reading Group? (Research)</h3>
<p>— Shen Chengzhao</p>
<p>Dear children, how quickly time flies! In the blink of an eye, the annual summer vacation has arrived again.</p>
<p>Are we going to just play and let the precious time slip away during the nearly two-month-long summer vacation? Are we going to forget the books we read at school and return them to the teacher? No, definitely not! We should find a way to not only remember the books we've read, but also add some knowledge to our minds.</p>
<p>The best way is to immediately organize a summer reading group. Reading is more interesting when it is organized.</p>
<p>As for the method of organizing a summer reading group, please see the left:</p>
<p>(1) Gather three to five people as basic members, responsible for borrowing books, returning books, convening meetings, and evaluating the work of members.</p>
<p>(2) Ordinary members, ten to twenty people, with every five people making up a group. Everyone discusses and decides on the books to be read in each group. Then, the time, amount, and deadline are also discussed and agreed upon in advance. After reading, everyone gathers again, and each member reports on the interest and insights gained from reading.</p>
<p>(3) Each group also has competitions. Which group reads the most books, which group reports the most clearly, and which group does the worst. The basic members will evaluate.</p>
<p>(4) Difficulties that are not understood can be raised for discussion.</p>
<p>(5) Tea party once a week. (Time and venue are determined by the group)</p>
<p>(6) Each member contributes two dimes. (For purchasing books, newspapers, tea, and refreshments)</p>
<p>Alright, time is precious, children, let's get up and do it!</p>

<h3>A Visit to a New German Mail Ship</h3>
<p>— Lin Dianyi, Third Grader of Shanghai Xiejin Elementary School</p>
<p>At 10 AM on June 27th, my fourth uncle and second brother came by car to pick up my father, sisters, and me to visit the Norddeutscher Lloyd's new mail ship, the Scharnhorst, at the Gonghexiang Wharf. When we got on the ship, we saw cranes lifting various goods from the cargo hold, some onto barges and some onto the dock. We visited various rooms, and the facilities were clean and magnificent. There was also a children's play area, and two open-air swimming pools on the deck. Then we went to the captain's quarters, stood next to the compass with my sisters, and my second brother took a picture of us to commemorate the occasion. Later, we went to the reception room and saw two oil paintings. One was of the famous World War I general and German President Hindenburg, who had already passed away, and the other was of the successor Head of State Hitler. They are both German national heroes who defended the country and resisted foreign insults, worthy of commemoration and worship. I hope our country can also produce more heroes of this kind. After the visit, it was already 12 o'clock, so we took the car home.</p>
<h3>A Wishful Thinking (Indian Fairy Tale)</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>In a certain town, there lived a weaver. One day, the wooden pegs on his loom broke. He took an ax and ran outside to look for wood. He ran to the beach and saw a large Bodhi tree. He thought to himself, "This tree looks good. If I cut it down, I can make many parts for the loom." As he thought this, he raised his ax and chopped at it.</p>
<p>At that moment, a fairy living in the big tree came out and said, "Friend, this tree is my home. I live here very happily. Please spare it."</p>
<p>"But, sir," the weaver replied, "sparing your home means starving my family, because the loom that feeds my family is now missing pegs. So, please move somewhere else, and quickly. I'm going to cut down this tree."</p>
<p>The fairy said, "Sir, since that's the case, I'll give you whatever you want, as long as you spare this tree."</p>
<p>"Then," the weaver said, "let me go back and ask my friend and my wife." The fairy agreed, and the weaver set off for home. On the way to the town, he met his friend, the barber! He said, "Friend, the fairy promised me that he would give me whatever I want. Tell me what I should ask for."</p>
<p>The barber replied, "Friend, if that's really the case, then ask for a kingdom! You can be the emperor, and I can be the prime minister. Is there anything better than that in the world?"</p>
<p>The weaver returned home and said to his wife, "Dear wife, today a fairy promised me that he would give me whatever I want. Think about it, what should I ask for? My friend, the barber, told me to ask for a kingdom."</p>
<p>"Dear husband," the wife said, "don't listen to the barber. Being a king is the most troublesome and unsafe thing. Ask for something else instead."</p>
<p>"What something else, you say?"</p>
<p>"Before, you wove a bolt of cloth every day, enough for us to spend for one day. Now, go and ask for another head and two more arms. Then you can weave a bolt of cloth in front and a bolt of cloth in back every day. One bolt of cloth is enough for us to spend for one day, and you can save the money from the other bolt of cloth for a better life in the future."</p>
<p>The weaver was very happy and said, "That's a good idea. I've decided to listen to you."</p>
<p>The weaver went to the fairy and explained his request: "Fairy, please give me a second head and second pair of arms." As soon as he finished speaking, he became a man with two heads and four arms.</p>
<p>The weaver walked home, feeling very happy. When the people saw him, they thought he was a monster. Everyone beat him with sticks and threw stones at him. He died on the road, leaving behind a broken loom at home.</p>

<h3>The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor (26)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>For a long time I continued in this hunting sport, every day an elephant fell by my bow; one day, as I was watching the beasts from the tree, I saw a great herd appear. The earth shook because of them, and the sounds they made filled me with fear.</p>
<p>They surrounded the tree I sat upon, their little black eyes constantly fixed on me; they gave me such a fright that my bow fell from my hand.</p>
<p>A great beast came near the tree, twisted its trunk with its trunk, and tugged hard; and the tree was uprooted and thrown to the ground.</p>
<p>Of course, I fell with the tree. The elephant came to me, and with his trunk, rolled me up and placed me on his back. I knew not what would happen, and lay as if half dead.</p>
<p>Then the whole herd went with me, until they came to a distant place; then I was placed upon the ground.</p>
<p>Thereupon they left me and went away. As soon as I was sure that they were all gone, I struggled to rise; and found myself upon a great mountain, scattered over with the bones and tusks of dead elephants.</p>
<p>I then comprehended wherefore the beasts had brought me to this place, they knew that I killed them for their teeth and thought that if I knew these bones, I would stop killing them.</p>
<p>I did not delay, but immediately set out for the town. I arrived there and sought the man who had bought me, and told him my news.</p>
<p>He rejoiced to see me, for he had been in the forest, and had seen my bow lying near to a tree that had been uprooted. Seeing these things, he thought that the beasts had killed me.</p>
<p>I told him all that had happened to me, and what I had seen on the mountain. The next day we went out together and obtained a great quantity of ivory.</p>
<p>After we went back, he said: "Sinbad, I will not treat you like a slave any longer, you are free. I will tell you why. Although I did not tell you before, the elephants in those forests killed many slaves, like you sent to kill them because of their teeth. You were not hurt, which shows that God is watching over you, so the beasts could not harm you. What you found on the mountain gave me a great fortune! I will give you your freedom and make you rich."</p>
<p>Hearing this, I hastened to say: "My lord, may God watch over you. I do not want wealth; now that I am free, I wish to leave this place and return to my home."</p>
<p>He said: "So that you may do so, I will pay you all the expenses of the voyage. Soon there will be ships coming to buy all our ivory, and you can take one of them to go home."</p>
<p>I had to stay with him for a few days, waiting for the time when the ships would come.</p>

<p>—Midday Increase of Ten Dollars and Four Cents—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw overseas silver markets suddenly announce declines, with extremely weak support. Market sentiment was stimulated, leading to a surge in buying that pushed prices beyond the forty-dollar mark. Due to swap transactions, the market conditions for half the day were particularly mediocre, with insignificant fluctuations. The morning began with overseas silver markets retracting, and major support levels reported weakness. The final transaction price after the market closed continued to drop by 1.25. The forward silver price in Montreaux also fell by between 7.5 and 1.25 fen. Exchange rates slightly contracted, and the price of London raw gold rose by three pence.

Despite this, market sentiment was quite strong, and buyers took advantage of the dips to maintain their positions. In addition, the Hong Kong market softened, making it easier to rebound. Although banks were unwilling to increase their holdings, British American Tobacco continued to buy US dollars, keeping the Hong Kong market tight. Reuters reported that Indian silver was expected to fall by three annas, stabilizing the situation. Although there was a slight setback at the end due to Hong Kong market easing by 0.0625 and support levels reporting strength, buying interest was strong, and the midday market remained bullish. Prices continued to rise after the market closed, and the overall trend for the day was robust. The rollover trading for August and September will begin on Monday, and it is predicted that the short side will still need to cover, but the level of the premium will depend on the strength of both sides.

<h3>Securities Large Investors Need to Roll Over Positions, Government Bonds Once Flourish</h3>
<p>96 Experiences Another Major Ups and Downs… Many Storms Ahead</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various prices at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange initially continued to develop well, but later fluctuated due to pressure from a certain party. However, due to the urgent need of large investors, it soon flourished again, and the closing trend was originally strong. Unexpectedly, after the severe flooding in Hankou, buying interest suddenly declined, and sellers took advantage of the momentum, causing market prices to weaken again. The trend and future prospects are feared to have some hesitation. The 96 Government Bonds experienced significant ups and downs throughout the day. In the early morning, due to large-scale absorption by No. 4, the peak reached over 10 yuan. Subsequently, No. 4 suddenly released large quantities, and market sentiment was once again hit, causing market prices to fall again. The closing price was initially lackluster, but later, 48, 47, and 53 actively absorbed positions, and the trend became fierce again. It is rumored that the bonds have great strength in manipulation, and the fluctuations are different from before. Future volatility is expected to increase, and short sellers must be cautious. Yesterday's market prices uniformly rose sharply, ranging from 3-5 jiao to about 1 yuan. 96 also rose by 3-4 jiao. The total turnover was approximately 20 million yuan. The highs, lows, and results are listed in the comparative table below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Prices Fall Again by 60 Yuan This Month</h3>
<p>After rising the day before, the yarn market showed signs of weakness again yesterday. Due to tight financial conditions and sluggish yarn sales, and with the delivery deadline for this month approaching, buyers were experiencing difficulties in receiving goods due to tight credit, making it difficult to maintain the 60-yuan level and causing prices to occasionally break through. However, most people believed that the base had bottomed out, leaning towards a bullish outlook. Foreign firms still engaged in swap activities.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Yarn Experiences Another Decline</p>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market was slightly improved due to the favorable situation on the previous day, and buyers made some purchases, causing prices for each month to rise by 0.3-0.4 jiao. After two or three rounds of bidding, the spot yarn market became quiet. A certain bull closed out positions, causing market prices to decline. As a result, near-term prices fell by 0.2-0.4 jiao compared to the closing prices of the previous day, quickly dropping by 0.1 jiao. The afternoon session opened flat, and after two or three rounds of bidding, rumors circulated in the market that spot yarn business was very slow. The total transaction volume for the day was only over 300 bales, mostly 10-count yarns. Sellers slightly increased. As a result, prices for each month fell by 0.2-0.4 jiao compared to the morning closing prices. A total of 650 bales of Dafu, 750 bales of Renfeng, 450 bales of Changfeng, 1,200 bales of Hengchang, 850 bales of Daji, and 450 bales of Dachang were sold. 300 bales of Dafeng, 400 bales of Gengfeng, 1,200 bales of Ruida, 700 bales of Shenyu, and 800 bales of Hexing were purchased.

<p>New Cotton Hubei Gang Returns to Purchase</p>
<p>The multi-headed cotton market for July and August maintains control, and does not release its positions, resulting in a uniquely tight market. Yesterday, the US and Indian cotton markets turned upwards, and the standard gold price also rose, causing market sentiment to become more bullish. Due to the severe flooding, the Hubei gang came to purchase new cotton again. However, spot cotton sales are sluggish.</p>
<p>Zheng Marked Cotton Uniquely Falls This Month</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened in the morning with near-term market conditions remaining strong. The atmosphere of many parties preparing to squeeze shorts was extremely strong. The US and Indian cotton markets also turned upwards, and the Hankou gang sent a telegram to purchase due to the flooding in that area, bringing improvement to the market. As a result, near-term prices were the same as the closing prices of the previous day, and far-term prices rose by 0.05-0.2 jiao. In the afternoon session, there were rumors that goods from Hankou were coming to Shanghai for delivery, and the inspection office already had 3,400 dan of qualified cotton.

<h3>Last Week's US Cotton was Stable and Quiet</h3>
<p>New York Cable News on the 12th reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that the government's field estimates were as expected, and market sentiment was stable. Due to a lack of sellers, the industry fixed near-term prices, but there was a lack of demand for far-term months, and some people sold off. With favorable weather in the South, domestic cotton mills continued to reduce labor, and when the October term price reached above 11.75 cents, supplies increased. The East received beneficial showers, while the Southwest was sunny and hot, so new cotton has made good progress over the past three weeks. It is heard that the Cotton Farmers' Public Storage Organization has 1,500 bales, and if delivery is not made by July 27, it will be settled at approximately 33 pounds sterling near the July difference. Attached are the weekend statistics for US cotton (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>American Cotton Spot Prices Higher Than Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened up two to four points for various months. The morning rise was due to purchases by fellow traders and spot merchants, along with positive news from Liverpool. The October futures bulls shifted to May. Later, Liverpool firms and the West, due to sluggishness in the wheat market, successively sold off. Fortunately, local firms bought in, and some short sellers in the stock market covered their positions, so the favorable weather had no immediate impact. Hentz &amp; Co. estimated this week's factory usage at 190,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory at 210,000 bales. The market closed firm, with spot prices up 10 points and futures up five to eight points. English cotton spot prices fell four points, while futures rose three to four points. Indian cotton short sellers covered old cotton, and futures traders bought new cotton. As a result, Broach rose 1.75 to 2 rupees, Oomra rose 1.25 to 1.5 rupees, and White Broach rose 2 to 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated the 12th).</p>

<h3>Foodstuffs - Flour and Wheat Plunge Sharply Again</h3>
<p>The flour market saw another sharp drop yesterday. Quotations for foreign wheat from Chicago fell around 5-6 jiao, and from Canada fell 1 jiao. The market sentiment was unanimously cautious, mainly because the domestic economy is in a state of contraction, and the purchasing power of both the public and private sectors is naturally weak. This year's Yangtze River disaster area is both severe and large, and there should be some pull from that, but there is no movement at present. Overseas trends are also unfavorable, so opening prices were weak. By the afternoon, market sentiment for near-term deliveries became even more fearful because actual sales were sluggish. Bulls had no choice but to unwind their positions, and the decline was therefore sharp. It was reported that factories and trading houses placed orders for foreign wheat for far-term deliveries at prices between 4.40 and 4.41 yuan, so sellers switched to dropping prices without end. As a result, the current month fell by as much as 3 fen, August fell 3 fen, September fell 2.5 fen, October fell 2.25 fen, November fell 2 fen, and December fell 1.5 fen, it was said.</p>
<p>The wheat market was uniformly weak yesterday because quotations for foreign wheat continued to fall, and the selling of spot wheat was incessant. Moreover, domestic new wheat had just entered the market, and this phenomenon already exists. It is naturally more difficult to imagine what will happen later. The silence of buyers has a reason. There were spot wheat hedges for near-term deliveries and foreign wheat hedges for far-term deliveries, so bid prices uniformly loosened. As a result, the current month fell 3 fen, August fell 3 fen, September and October fell 4 fen, and November fell 7 fen. Trading houses directly supplied about 1,000 bags of spot wheat to factories at prices of 3.27-3.35 yuan, but the guild market did not officially list it, it was said.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat July 11 July 12 Change</p>
<p>September 84.25 82.25 Down 2.00</p>
<p>December 85.50 83.625 Down 1.875</p>
<p>Spot 93.75 92.50 Down 1.25</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat July 11 July 12 Change</p>
<p>August 80.625 80.375 Down 0.25</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Fall Again Due to Hot and Sunny Weather</h3>
<p>Local rice: Yesterday, the total arrival of goods from various sources in Shanghai South was 23-24 batches (totaling 4,700-4,800 shi). The downward trend was particularly fierce, with a drastic drop. Sales of various thick japonica and thin indica rices continued to be sluggish, and market quotations plummeted again by 0.10-0.40 yuan. Only the Qingdao firm bought over a hundred bags. Yinlian yuan was negatively affected. In Shanghai North, 18-19 boats arrived from various river areas yesterday. Various goods in the market were moving slowly. White japonica rice saw a slight improvement with price reductions, with high-grade rice down 0.20 yuan and medium-grade rice down 0.30-0.40 yuan. Early thin indica rice sales were also sluggish, with prices down 0.20-0.30 yuan. White yuan sales remained sluggish, and prices fell slightly again. The prices of other goods also fell by about 0.10 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the foreign rice market situation, although sales along the Yangtze River were active, the situation continued to show softness. After the hot weather, many river rice sellers were eager to sell off their stock, and medium-grade foreign rice sellers were also very eager to sell. High-grade foreign rice had arrived, and the market already showed signs of weakness. Yesterday, sales along the Yangtze River decreased slightly, and the local market was even more quiet, with very tight price controls for immediate needs. Therefore, high and medium-grade rice prices generally softened. However, due to the serious flooding along the Yangtze River, there will definitely be a need for smooth operations in the future, so prices were able to hold. Yesterday, a total of 7,000 bags of Western-bought rice were sold, including high-grade gongmi, small jiaomi, Su japonica, and Siamese rice, with prices similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Prices Also Falling Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean cake market prices fell by 0.07-0.08 yuan in one day. This was because there were very few inquiries in the morning market, causing general small-scale stockpilers to be eager to sell off their stock. Bid prices were far apart from factory prices. Even if there were scattered sales, it was like finding treasure. So, the sales volume reached over 10,000 pieces. Sales of soybeans were only slightly active in the local market.</p>
<h3>Metals - Pig Lead and Iron Prices Fall by Over One Yuan</h3>
<p>Recent transactions in pig lead and iron have been sluggish because toy factories have stopped procurement. The market situation is very stagnant. The standard price is falling frequently due to the unfavorable environment. The quoted price is estimated at 18.50 yuan per 200 pounds, down 1.50 yuan from before. New goods continue to arrive, so there is concern that market prices will fall further. In addition, the prices of iron from the Hui Si Company are still quite strong due to the tight exchange rate. Each piece is quoted at 27.50 yuan, and slightly inferior pieces are also quoted at 26.50 yuan. It is reported that over 100 boxes were sold yesterday, it was said.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Sheet After the Off-Season</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of black iron sheets have passed their peak. Customer firms have already stopped, and local factories have only a few transactions. The market situation is very quiet. Various market standards are reported to be falling one after another. Yesterday's transactions were only 70-80 dan. The quoted price for 26-inch, 18-sheet patterned sheets is estimated at 6.50 yuan, and the quoted price for 36-inch, 3-10 sheet patterned sheets is 7 yuan. It is reported that supply exceeds demand, and market sentiment is fearful. It is still necessary to guard against further declines in future market prices.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - High-Grade Chun Mee Tea Sales Smooth and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British firms such as Ewo, Jardine Matheson, Longyu Baochang, and the China Tea Company, driven by strong overseas demand, actively sought out Chun Mee green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas. Sales were exceptionally smooth. Arrivals were almost immediately sold, and the market situation was quite brisk. The highest market price had already reached 124 yuan, up 2-3 yuan from before. Common grades of Chun Mee such as needle tea, pearl tea, Gongxi, etc., also saw stable market prices. Lower-grade goods appeared to be more active than before, and the market situation has reached a stable state.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods - Xiang Lotus Seeds Report Crop Failure Due to Flooding</h3>
<p>Hankou-Shanghai Market Prices Tight</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to a letter from Hankou, the Xiangxi region's harvest of Xiang lotus seeds is bound to be poor due to flooding, and the source of supply has been disrupted. The market situation suddenly tightened. Therefore, sales in the local market increased by 3 yuan or more. For example, new Jiu Xi lotus seeds in the shell were quoted at 33-34 yuan, and old goods followed closely. However, the inventory of various firms was already not thick, and most of it was stored in cold storage warehouses. Now, hearing this news, there is even more certainty about future price increases. The resolve to hold on is becoming stronger. There is hope that high-quality goods will reach 46-47 yuan in the future. Yesterday, according to a telegram from Hankou, new tree ears were disrupted by flood in their source so the shipment stopped, and local prices rose. The price was 86-87 yuan, or perhaps nearly 90 yuan. The local market price for top-grade Air Mail small-package tree ears is still 105-106 yuan; other items are the same. The future market may follow the tightening trend.</p>
<h3>Oil Market - Reasons for the Sudden Rise and Fall of Asphalt</h3>
<p>Asphalt sales are usually in the off-season during the summer. However, with the rise of soap factories, most of their raw materials are taken from asphalt. Therefore, asphalt usage for soap-making is more than for candle-making. It is precisely during the period when candle production is suspended in the summer that factories are actively using asphalt. Moreover, since soap usage is greater than candle usage, summer sales are always more brisk than winter sales. Therefore, for the past ten years or so, there has been no real off-season. Supply and demand are well balanced. However, the situation has suddenly changed in the past three or four years. Soap-making now almost exclusively uses foreign products such as coconut oil and tallow, and asphalt soap-making has reached its limit. Therefore, every summer, it reverts to the previous off-season situation. This year's summer sales will be no exception. Since entering summer, sales have been quiet. Fortunately, inventories everywhere are low, so even though sales are light, they will not plummet. Last week, because there had been no transactions for a long time in the Hankou market, Chongjing oil fell to 11.7-11.8 taels, and Macheng oil fell to 11.4 taels. However, after the price drop, various firms in Hankou believed that the opportunity had arrived and wanted to make purchases. But the reason for the price drop in Hankou was that there had been no transactions for a long time. It was intended to stimulate the market and not because of abundant inventory. Seeing that various firms were interested in buying, the market turned around again. According to details in yesterday's letter from Hankou, there was not much Macheng oil available at 12 taels. It can be seen that last week's price drop was not a formal market event. The prices rose and fell quickly. In short, although sales are light, inventories are very low, so the market seems weak. However, as soon as there is a transaction, prices can easily rise. Local firms have very thin inventories and are not paying attention to procurement because sales are slow. Seeing that prices in Hankou had fallen slightly this time, they had also telegraphed orders, but after seeing the prices rise again, they stopped. Market quotations are still inconsistent. Approximately, Chongjing oil prices are very low, around 20 yuan per dan, it was said.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Student Unrest at Suzhou Women's Normal School</h3>
<p>— Liu Yu</p>
<p>In recent years, under the impetus of "rectifying academic style" and "bearing humiliation and burden, burying oneself in studies," students across the country have long become herds of docile lambs. They either bury themselves under the window, diligently pursuing academic credits and diplomas, or they live in a drunken dream, clinging to the enjoyment before their eyes. The active spirit of the "May Fourth" and "May Thirtieth" eras has long since vanished. In such a silent atmosphere, the students of Suzhou Women's Normal School unexpectedly launched the "expulsion of the principal unrest" on May 14. This is indeed a major event worthy of attention.</p>
<p>According to a report by the Jiangsu Education Department on July 9, the main cause of this unrest was "due to the issue of the retention or dismissal of the Director of Moral Education, Sun Qimin, teachers interfered, and students coerced the signing of contracts"; and Sun Qimin "apparently condoned and instructed" the unrest. It is of course impossible to make a rash judgment as to whether the aforementioned reasons are true; however, simply based on the above report, we cannot help but raise our doubts. If the Director of Moral Education Sun Qimin "behaved improperly and had impure thoughts," why was she able to "instruct" the entire school's students to come forward and retain her, and even cause "overly regulated behavior" such as "coercing the signing of contracts!" On the other hand, why was Principal Chen, who supposedly "has been the principal for eight years and has achieved remarkable results," instead expelled by all the students? That is to say, students' thinking is naive and easily manipulated; but in secondary schools with "remarkable achievements," having received five or six years of education, and soon to become teachers, they should not be completely without the ability to distinguish this crucial issue!</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if the cause of the unrest was indeed due to teachers' "condoning and instructing," the responsibility cannot be pushed to the students; because the hiring of teachers is entirely the principal's prerogative. It is heard that the Director of Moral Education who was dismissed this time has been teaching at the school for six years, has always been admired by the principal, and has even won a commendation from the Education Department. If it is indeed true that she "behaved improperly and had impure thoughts"; the principal should first bear the responsibility. The Education Department, on the one hand, admits that the principal "failed to properly select personnel," and on the other hand, uses the phrase "has been the principal for eight years and has achieved remarkable results" to lightly cover it up, but the so-called "remarkable achievements" have no factual proof; what we see is only such a small "achievement" as causing the expulsion of the entire school's students. From this point of view, the so-called "has been the principal for eight years and has achieved remarkable results" is as incomprehensible as "behaved improperly and had impure thoughts."</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the students, the end of this unrest resulted in the expulsion of as many as ten students, which was probably unexpected. But in the eyes of those with even a little social science knowledge, this is not surprising. There is no such thing as absolute right and wrong in the world; the "legitimate demands" in one position will become "overly regulated actions" in another position. Conversely, in the eyes of students, that kind of "lamb"-like education also has its social basis. If it is thought that this is the matter of a few people, and it can be resolved by the retention or dismissal of a few people: then they will inevitably receive the most severe lesson.</p>

<h3>Section 3: Free Love and Marriage</h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution also brought about significant changes in love and marriage relationships.</p>
<p>We know that in the slave economic era, there was so-called buying marriage, which is a marriage where livestock, grains, and cash are used as payment to buy a bride. Also, in the feudal era, there was so-called blind marriage, which is a marriage that is forcibly arranged regardless of the wishes of the parties involved, based solely on the interests of the family and family economy. In other words, it is all the "parental command, matchmaker's word" marriage in China. However, in capitalist society, that kind of marriage form could no longer be suitable for the social organization of capitalists, so it was abandoned and a new marriage relationship was created, which is the so-called sacred free love and marriage contract.</p>
<p>When the industrial and commercial citizens first appeared on the stage of history, they indeed swore the freedom of marriage, recognized the right of the parties involved in the marriage to choose their own partners, and even praised the union based on the true consent and mutual sexual love between the two sexes. However, this is only a reflection of the liberalism of civil society. In reality, so-called "free" love inevitably becomes the prisoner of money under the complex economic relationships of selfishness. In detail, in propertied society, so-called free love, no matter how pure and sincere its motivation, cannot but be restricted by monetary relations. The love affair between Huang Huiru and Lu Genrong, master and servant, which caused a sensation in Shanghai a few years ago, ultimately did not exceed that principle. Moreover, in this society dominated by the "sacred" private ownership of property, many people with ulterior motives even regard love as a speculative means to acquire property!</p>
<p>Propertied society replaced the previous buying and arranged marriage system with a commercial marriage contract. "The parties involved in the marriage became contractors who carried out transactions with 'equal' qualifications. These parties mutually become buyers and sellers." Among them, one party guarantees love with money, and the other party exchanges money for love. So-called marriage completely belongs to the laws of the capitalist commodity market. Capitalism "liberated" women from the buying and arranged marriage system, making them "businesswomen" who had no choice but to sell love. The modern British novelist Arnold wrote this about the heroine in his novel "Like":</p>
<p>"She received special training in order to get a man with property, and she finally succeeded. That is, she married the Duke of Sherrill. This is equivalent to marrying 20,000 acres of land in England, 4,000 acres of land in Scotland, a property in Piccadilly, seven properties in various towns and cities, a steam yacht, and 500,000 pounds of Central England Railway stock, etc."</p>
<p>This is what is said to tens of millions of men and women, young and old, in capitalist society, and it is the formula of marriage in propertied society. In other words, almost everyone has to marry the owner of a coal mine, oil, department store, etc., and has to marry the boss of bank deposits, gold and silver jewelry, steel factories, etc.</p>
<p>Bebel said it well about marriage in propertied society! He said: "Money marriage is the safest and easiest way to achieve high-level social life! One side desires as much money as possible, and the other side yearns for titles, honors, and status. In the upper class, they seek satisfactory objects in this way. Thus, marriage becomes a transaction, a customary union, where two people show respect, but in their hearts, each person has their own ideas."</p>
<p>In reality, it is not only women who pursue rich men; at the same time, men also seek women with property. That is to say, those who hope to acquire wealth and officials who are poor in campaign expenses seek daughters with money and power, hoping to obtain property at the same time as their wives. Especially after women acquired property inheritance rights, this tendency became even more obvious. What is this if not the prostitution of marriage!</p>
<p>Of course, under the conditions of capitalist society, when women without economic independence must live a life of eternal parasitism on their fathers or husbands, this prostitution is unavoidable. Regarding this point, we can see very clear evidence among working women. A worker's daughter gains economic independence very early. At the same time, she gains independence from her family. This kind of woman decides her own destiny by her own strength and solves marriage problems according to her own personal will.</p>
<p>When a woman can live entirely by her own strength, her love feelings will not be stained by financial considerations, and will be expressed in a very natural and pure form. The economic independence of women and its valuable influence on her love cannot be denied by even sociologists in the ruling class. Erneste, the author of "The Breakdown of the Family", Moller explains the marital relationship of working women as follows.</p>
<p>"If women can obtain the living resources and a certain social status that they previously obtained by marriage through their own labor, then the efforts of women to guarantee their own lives through marriage have only a small meaning. Because, except for those directly related to sexual life, almost all of her wishes are not only satisfied in marriage, but also can be satisfied outside of marriage. Therefore, she regards marriage as the realization of love and passion." (See Sociology of Family and Marriage)</p>
<p>Finally, here, we must understand that women with money and working women have completely different attitudes and practices towards love and marriage!</p>
<h3>Examination and Answers on Women's Issues</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaoying</p>
<p>My letters unexpectedly attracted the attention of so many people in society, who earnestly explored various aspects of the women's movement. This proves that the women's movement has practical significance and a mission in the current stage of society. Besides expressing my utmost respect and gratitude to the gentlemen who participated in the discussion, I also feel it is necessary to say a few more words.</p>
<p>The "Women's Corner" has published seventy-two issues. The content is for objective facts to judge. However, since the March 8th Women's Day this year, we must admit that this exploration is its most valuable achievement. This achievement, in the process of the women's movement, is indeed worthy of attention and deep thought. The motivation for writing that letter was to correct Mr. Shiyin's points: "Why does the women's movement have to be a separate term? As if it has independent business to do," and "Women's movement, using the word 'rights' to incite people to fight." Indeed, no one can deny that women's issues are closely related to social issues. In other words, women's issues cannot be resolved independently of the entire social issue. In the summer of the year before last, the Shanghai Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association held a lecture on social issues, and I was one of the speakers. The topic I spoke on was: "Social Issues and Women's Issues." At that time, I elaborated on the significance of this topic in detail. I never narrowly separated the women's movement from the entire social issue and targeted men as its sole target. In short, I believe that women's issues contain many complex social issues.</p>
<p>Now I want to give a brief answer to the articles published by Mr. Luo Qiong, Mr. Lin Gengbai, Mr. Xu Zexiang, ... - in fact, most of it is self-declaration:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Mr. Luo Qiong's article published in the 70th issue of "Women's Corner," "A Review of the Chinese Women's Movement, and a Discussion on Mr. Wang Xiaoying's Letter to the Editor of Women's Youth," many of the meaningful theories mentioned in it are what I have said in the past, especially during the lecture on "Social Issues and Women's Issues" at the Youth Association in the summer of the year before last, when this meaning was discussed in detail. This time, it was only to correct Mr. Shiyin's two misunderstandings, so it was not mentioned. Now that Mr. Luo has made a special supplementary explanation, I thank him for his kindness with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Mr. Lin's article published in the 71st issue of "Women's Corner," "A Criticism That Is Not Criticism," it says: "The mission of the women's movement is not to make the struggle between the sexes the ultimate goal. The modern women's movement should have its important significance and should target the entire social system." In today's semi-colonial Chinese society, which is invaded by capitalism externally and suppressed by feudal ideology internally, in such an abnormal and contradictory dynamic, it is indeed not only the issue of the women's movement, but also all other issues. If you want to get a solution or improvement, you must not focus on the plane of a certain issue and ignore the three-dimensional aspects that can achieve its actual effect. Because local movements are not the most appropriate way to fundamentally solve the problem. The so-called "treat the head when it hurts, and treat the foot when it hurts" method is no longer applicable today. Mr. Lin's general meaning is quite similar to that of Mr. Luo: that women's issues cannot be resolved independently of the entire social issue. I fully agree with this point of view. As for Mr. Lin saying that I am a woman who is relatively close to the government, and I can still retain the courage of the May Fourth era to resist the recent revival movement of women, it is amazing! In fact, people in the atmosphere of the women's movement should have this consistent spirit and attitude, and should never promote the name of the women's movement for their own happiness. We must not only expose the conspiracies of those women's movement people who hang sheep's heads and sell dog meat, but also further attack them and expose their ugliness! Some people say that the result of my participation in the women's movement for more than ten years is just that I have achieved personal success; but is that really the case? No, definitely not. People who say such things may have misunderstood my personality, or mistaken the nature of things. At least I dare to say that since I have been practicing the women's movement, I have never sold my soul and conscience, and I have always taken the entire society and women as the premise, so-called "sacrificing the small self and fulfilling my duty."</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Mr. Xu's "Contradictions of the Women's Movement" published in the Morning Post's Sunday Review on June 9, what he said can be said to be completely aimed at modern fashionable women. He lamented the fashionable women: "... since they have unloaded all their responsibilities to the family and society, and pursue a highly Westernized life with a completely unproductive body, they go out dressed in heavy makeup, singing and dancing, and when they return, they order around, with servants and maids in front of them, and they do not hesitate to pay for the crystallization of the blood and sweat of thousands of workers and peasants as the price of rouge and perfume..." However, this can only be said to be a unique form of urban, especially Shanghai, wives, young ladies, and young mistresses. It should be known that the vast majority of women in China are still struggling and fighting under the oppression of the social class. These oppressed women, their daily lives are "hard-working and thrifty," they absolutely have not unloaded their responsibilities to the family and society, and they have not been infected with the bad habits of modern fashionable women! Mr. Xu now uses a special image to erase the general facts of women. Obviously, his focus on women is limited to a certain point of view in society, and he has failed to accurately see the state of women in the entire society, so that he only sees a small number of extravagant and wasteful modern fashionable women in modern China, and ignores the vast majority of hardworking, simple, and sincere non-fashionable women. In this wave of shouting "women go back to the family"! "Virtuous wife and good mother"! Should we still stop eating because of this? However, Mr. Xu's benevolent intentions are worthy of attention. At least his lament can give modern women who are only engaged in consumption and cannot produce a powerful warning!</p>
<p>As for Mr. Gao Hong's article "After Reading the Letter to the Editor of Women's Youth, Shiyin," perhaps it was because his views on the facts were different, so his remarks were also different. Although there are some points in the seven items that are worthy of acceptance, subjective prejudice is also inevitable. This is just as the editor of "Women's Corner" said: "The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom." Due to space limitations, I will not say more here.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that those who are engaged in the women's movement will pay attention to practical work, with a spirit of fearlessness and strong perseverance. Stand in the center of solving the entire social issue and seek the liberation of women at the current stage!</p>
<p>Mid-length Creation</p>
<h3>Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Xiuzhen left the countryside for the city three years ago. Now she has just returned from the city, and the countryside that she hasn't seen for several years is re-emerging in front of her: the mountains are still standing as before; the river is still lying meandering as before; the fields are also as before, and the path she is walking on at the moment is also stretching out as before. But she always feels a different feeling from before, she deeply feels desolate, and a kind of uneasy pressure is threatening her. Looking around carefully, everything has changed after all: on the mountain, there are no lush trees as before; the river water is not as deep as before; in the fields, there are no wheat and bean seedlings as before; on the side of the path, many mud blocks have collapsed; some of the stone slabs are also broken and crooked. She staggered along, looking into the distance at a woman washing rice at the river pier, not knowing whether it was a neighbor or an aunt, but as she approached the river pier, she saw from all the actions that the woman was her sister-in-law, but indeed she had changed like the scenery. Before, her sister-in-law was fat, with flesh all over her body, a long and round face, and red cheeks. Now she has become thin, and she doesn't know who pinched the flesh on her cheeks. The bone of her nose is high, and it is pointed and exposed.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen took a step forward and called out. The sister-in-law, who was busy washing rice, was stimulated by this call, and the sound that had been unfamiliar for several years suddenly appeared behind her. She suddenly raised her head, and the rice basket was almost overturned. She stared at Xiuzhen, thinking it was a stranger. Naturally, Xiuzhen has also changed now. She used to see a lively young girl, but now she is thin, yellow, and lackluster, like a dried melon. The sister-in-law was stunned for a while before she remembered:</p>
<p>Oh... it's sister! Oh my, you're back! Mother-in-law is really worried about you! She quickly packed up the things she had washed and walked shoulder to shoulder with Xiuzhen, and then continued, but her voice was slightly lower:</p>
<p>--Have you seen your brother?</p>
<p>--Ha! Is my brother in Shanghai? But I didn't see him. When did he go?</p>
<p>--It's been more than a year, and there's been no news since he left. He hasn't even sent a letter back. The sister-in-law's eyes were a little teary.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law walked silently closer to home. Chickens were walking in the porch, and chicken manure was all over the ground. The yellow dog barked wildly. The young mistress Wang next door was making silver ingots with the maid Ajú. Hearing the dog barking wildly, the young mistress Wang said repeatedly:</p>
<p>--It must be a beggar, Ajú! Close the door quickly! --There was a loud bang of closing the door</p>
<p>Xiuzhen's mother was sitting in front of her door chanting Buddha. Perhaps feeling that the six words "Namo Amitabha Buddha" were too troublesome to chant, she often simply chanted: Buddha, Buddha, Amitabha Buddha. She heard the dog barking at this moment, and in order to interject a few words, she chanted even more simply:</p>
<p>--Buddha, Buddha, Buddha,... the dog is barking again, it must be a beggar. There are really many beggars these years. Buddha, Buddha, Amitabha Buddha....</p>
<p>Xiuzhen saw her mother. Her mother's square face and broad body were still the same as before, but obviously she was much older. First, her eyes were much dimmer, and it seemed that one of them had become blind.</p>
<p>--Mom! Xiuzhen called.</p>
<p>--Ah! Who is it?... My Xiuzhen? The mother hurriedly stood up, and the rosary followed her. "Amitabha, my flesh, you're back!"</p>
<p>The mother was so happy that she was crying, she didn't know what to say, she just moved her lips tremblingly. But she was sad and loved her. She looked at her daughter's yellow and thin face, thin clothes, and a wave of sadness added to it. She knew that her daughter had returned in such a scene, with a lost appearance and empty hands, obviously she was not successful in Shanghai. She immediately led her daughter into the room, lifted her left eyelid so that she could see more clearly:</p>
<p>--Oh! To be so thin! She hurriedly wrapped the rosary and put it in the drawer, and then took out a piece of dried tofu. "You eat this piece of dried tofu. A few days ago, I chanted Buddha at the young mistress Wang's house, and she gave me the dried tofu as a snack. Now, everything is getting smaller. In the past, the snack for chanting Buddha was always a whole..."</p>
<p>Xiuzhen really didn't want to eat this moldy dried tofu, she wanted to eat something good, but she took it. She knew that she couldn't chew out any good taste from this thing, but this was a gift from her mother, a rare reunion after a long separation, and she was indeed a little hungry, so she stuffed it into her mouth, no matter how strong the cockroach smell was, she chewed it slowly, almost vomiting. The mother continued to grope, she wanted to find something else for her "treasure" - her daughter who was like a hungry louse. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Fair Discussion on the Problem of Vagrant Children Relief</h3>
<p>— Liu Xin</p>
<p>Since this year was designated as Children's Year from August 1, the news has spread, and people in society have paid considerable attention to children's welfare, which is one of the gratifying phenomena recently. At the same time, the public's attention is not only focused on how to educate the children of wealthy families, but also on how to relieve the poor and vagrant children, which is especially forward-looking.</p>
<p>On July 7, an article by Mr. Wang Maohe, "Relief for Wandering Children," was published in the Morning Post's Sunday Review, advocating the implementation of a poor children's annuity system as the only way to universally relieve vagrant children. The next day, an article by Mr. Fú, "Discussion on the Problem of Vagrant Children Relief," was published, analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the factory system and the poor children's annuity system from an objective standpoint. The writing was fluent and incisive, and it was truly a cannon roar before the opening ceremony of Children's Year.</p>
<p>Searching for the articles by Mr. Wang Maohe and Mr. Fú, there is no doubt that vagrant children need relief. The focus of the debate is nothing more than the method of relieving vagrant children. Mr. Maohe believes that the poor children's annuity system is beneficial for three reasons: "(1) Giving annuities to poor children allows them to receive assistance in their families without having to enter prison-like factories; (2) Changing factory assistance to annuity assistance can save on expenses such as salaries, and children will receive more benefits; (3) A family consignment system can be implemented, with annuities paid to entrusted families to educate orphans who have no home. In the future, when orphans grow up and become adults, they will surely receive assistance from the entrusted families and become established." There are three things that can be discussed here: one, the question of whether the family consignment system is possible; two, the question of whether annuity assistance is more economical than the factory system; three, the question of whether the family consignment system is more reasonable than the factory system. Let me express my humble opinion as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Poor children and vagrant children are always two different kinds of categories in terms of reason: poor children are unable to live and unable to be educated because of poverty. Although they may eventually become vagrant children, they have not yet reached the point of becoming vagrant children. They have not yet acquired the wandering habits that vagrant children generally acquire. If they are rescued in time, they can live and be educated, and the method must be no different from ordinary children. Therefore, it is not impossible to adopt an annuity assistance system to relieve poor children (if fundamentally speaking, if only a certain poor family is relieved of a certain (2) child, and the other people in this certain family still cannot survive, then it is still doubtful whether this annuity assistance can be fully used to relieve this certain child, but here we are talking about dragons and tigers, so we will not go into further involvement to avoid expanding the problem), as for vagrant children, they are either orphans without parents, or poor children from proletarian peasant families, or children who have fallen on the streets without families because they have acquired bad habits or hobbies (such as stealing and smoking). They are not only poor, but also have no home. They are not only wandering, but also have bad habits. Knowing this, then we can go on to talk about how to relieve them.</p>
<p>Mr. Maohe, who advocates the family consignment system, wants to apply it to both poor children and vagrant children, which is really a view that is not in line with the facts. For example, China has always emphasized the concept of clan, and childless parents often adopt poor children as adopted sons. Although this does not live up to the name of "family consignment," in fact, this is also the same as the meaning of poor children's consignment. However, what childless parents want to adopt is poor children, that is, the object willing to be entrusted is poor children. As for the vagrant children walking on the streets, they are often unwilling to be adopted by childless parents. May I ask if childless parents are unwilling to adopt vagrant children with bad habits, then who else is willing to raise a wandering child and let them be with their own children?--This is a question of the possibility of facts, not a question of theory, this is a question of China, not a question of empty talk of imitation. In this way, it can be seen that the "possibility" of adopting a family consignment system to relieve vagrant children is very weak.</p>
<p>(2) Secondly, is annuity assistance more "economical" than the factory system? How the source of annuity assistance funds is, let's put it aside for the time being, but decentralized assistance will inevitably lead to decentralized loans. As a result, I am afraid that it can only support poor children, and at most it can only do the step of educating poor children, which can be said to be purely consumption. As for the expenses of setting up factories, it seems roughly the same as the annuity assistance funds, which is also consumption, and as the Morning Post reporter said, there is also the consumption of "employees who are not paid," but this is only a short-sighted view. Although the annuity assistance system may have investigators and supervisors who are willing to fulfill their obligations, the education is scattered and not concentrated; if the factory system, although there is a small number of employees who pay wages, a certain plan can be implemented, such as the relief of vagrant children in Soviet Russia after the revolution, which also forcibly captured all vagrant children and put them into factories. At first, it was inevitably difficult to obey and the management was quite difficult, but with gradual steps and gradual training, this group of small vagrants on the streets could actually work and produce (because they are not low-energy, but not educated), and later became good workers in factories and good construction talents in the country, which is a good lesson. We should not only regard the relief of vagrant children as a consumption action, but we should concentrate many unused labor forces and use them for production and construction. Because annuity assistance is purely consumption, while the factory system is production - although it may not be able to achieve factory self-sufficiency, it will not be more wasteful than annuity assistance - so annuity assistance is really not more economical than the factory system.</p>
<p>(3) Assuming that we admit that the family consignment system has the possibility of general circulation, but may I ask what kind of families are the majority of Chinese families? Most parents do not know what education is, let alone what is reasonable education. How many vigorous and promising small citizens of China are killed by the hands of these ignorant parents, and wiped out under the stupidity of not understanding reasonable education methods! If we entrust the vagrant children to families who do not understand the reasonable methods of educating children, it is no different from "asking the way to the blind"! In this way, relieving vagrant children is still just adding a mask to the face of killing vagrant children. Assuming that we believe what the Morning Post reporter said: the United States vigorously implements the family consignment system and those who are entrusted can accept the entrustment, and Chinese families will definitely be able to accept the entrustment like the United States, but what is the use of being willing to accept the entrustment but not being able to reasonably educate?</p>
<p>Furthermore, can these generally forced entrusted families sincerely and conscientiously be responsible for rescuing the entrusted vagrant children? I am afraid this is not necessarily the case? Although there are supervisors who fulfill their obligations and are responsible for checking there, why is it necessary to use vagrant children as a touchstone for responsibility? In this comparison, it can be seen that it is easy to ask a small number of factory employees to be responsible, but it is more difficult to ask all the entrusted families to be responsible.</p>
<p>Therefore, the family consignment system is far inferior to the factory system in terms of reasonable education.</p>
<p>In summary, the possibility of adopting a family consignment system to relieve vagrant children is very weak, the annuity assistance system is not more economical than the factory system, and the family consignment system is even far inferior to the factory system in terms of reasonable education. Although Mr. Maohe wants to take a shortcut and seek cheap, but the facts often run counter to the ideal.</p>
<p>Folk tale</p>
<h3>Dragon Pearl</h3>
<p>— Ms. Wu Ling</p>
<p>The sun woke up from its sleep, slowly peeking its head out from the sea. Its blood-red light immediately illuminated the earth, and it gradually rode on a red fast horse, flying straight towards the sky. The radiating light pierced through the jade-green, calm sea, penetrating the dense forest like ten thousand sharp needles, shining upon the majestic high mountains, and reaching a row of simple, old thatched huts at the foot of the mountains.</p>
<p>Light awakened everything: a gentle breeze blew, the green leaves of the trees swayed back and forth; birds poked their heads out of their nests, saw the smiling face of the sun, and busily called their companions to sing songs; the wildflowers on the</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>meadow also straightened their waists, delicately emitting a light fragrance.</p>
<p>The door of a thatched hut creaked open, and a woman walked out. She went to the side of the hut and opened the door of the chicken coop. A small chick came out, clucking, and ate the millet scattered by the woman.</p>
<p>"Ming'er! Get up, it's not early," the woman called.</p>
<p>"I'm up, Mom!" Ming'er, a fifteen or sixteen-year-old, replied.</p>
<p>Having lost her husband early, she worked hard to raise Ming'er. She lived by spinning yarn, weaving cloth, or sewing clothes for others every day. When Ming'er grew to be eight or nine years old, he began to gather grass on the mountain, bringing it back to the market to sell after eating lunch every day, and exchanging it for some rice in the evening. In winter, he would cut trees and chop wood on the mountain, selling bundles to wealthy families. The mother and son helped each other and lived happily.</p>
<p>As usual, they got up very early. After eating, Ming'er took a sickle and rope and went to work on the mountain, while his mother began to weave cloth.</p>
<p>Saying goodbye to his mother, Ming'er walked along, singing mountain songs. He often stopped to listen to the melodious singing of the birds or bent down to pick a beautiful wildflower. Sometimes, when he encountered a strange bird or insect, he would catch it and carefully observe it. Passing through the forest, crossing the small river, a magnificent high mountain now stood before him. The mountain was covered with a layer of jade-like green grass. Stepping on it felt soft and fluffy. Skillfully climbing up, his strong body accompanied by cheerful steps, he reached the top of the mountain in a short while. Some of the grass on the mountain had already been cut and hadn't grown back, while some was still short, spread on the ground. He finally found a patch of grassland that was more than a foot tall. Overjoyed, he quickly began to work. Although he had a small body, he was strong and agile. In less than a quarter of an hour, a large area beside him was cleared. The sunlight secretly watched him through the gaps, the birds sang songs praising him, and the wind gently kissed him.</p>
<p>The next day, he went to the mountain as usual. When he unintentionally walked to the patch of grass he had cut the day before, he immediately discovered an astonishing phenomenon. Unexpectedly, in just one night, green grass more than a foot tall had grown back, while other places remained unchanged. He happily cut the grass, and before noon, he had already gathered as much as he could carry, so he went home. Seeing that it was still early, he went straight to the market.</p>
<p>His mother was washing rice by the river. From afar, she saw Ming'er coming. She was very surprised that he didn't have a basket on his back, but upon closer inspection, she saw that he was holding a paper bag in his hand. That was the rice that Ming'er usually didn't bring back until evening. How happy the mother was!</p>
<p>For several days in a row, he went to that patch of grass, and new grass grew out every day. He sold the grass very early every day, exchanged it for rice, and in the afternoon, he went to the mountain to cut grass, and then sold it again.</p>
<p>Curiosity drove him. When he went to that patch of grass today, he thought, "There must be some reason for this." So he began to look around for strange things, but there were none! Maybe the old tree next to it had a spirit, he ran over to take a look, but there was nothing. He looked east, he looked west, and busied himself for a while, but in the end, he still couldn't figure it out!</p>
<p>The next day, he thought that maybe there was something in the grassland, so he took a shovel with him. After cutting the grass, he dug down into the ground with the shovel, digging deeper and deeper, but there was nothing. His curiosity and determination made him continue to dig, and finally, he discovered something hard. He picked it up and looked at it. It turned out to be a small pearl, emitting a sparkling light, very beautiful. When he got home, he told his mother that it must be something precious, but his mother said that it was just a pretty pearl, and that it wasn't anything of real value! After eating dinner, it was already dark, which was when the villagers went to bed because they couldn't afford lamps. The mother and son were very surprised why it wasn't dark yet at this time, and the house was as bright as if the sun were shining. Ming'er went outside to take a look and saw the sky full of stars hanging in the sky. How strange that was! They finally discovered that the reason was that the pearl on the table was emitting light and illuminating everything.</p>
<p>A treasure! The mother knew it was a treasure. They were afraid that the villagers would find out, so they began to look for a place to hide it. No matter where they put it, as long as there was a small hole, its light would still shine out. Ming'er took out his clothes and wrapped it, but it didn't work. The light still shone through. Finally, they put it in the rice container, which only had a little rice left, and closed the lid. Only then did they feel relieved and happily go to sleep.</p>
<p>In the morning, the mother got up to prepare to cook rice. As soon as she opened the lid of the rice container, many grains of rice rolled out with a "whoosh," filling a large container full of white rice that could no longer hold any more! Amazement and joy filled the mother's heart as she shouted to wake Ming'er, tears of happiness streaming down her face!</p>
<p>"Ming'er! This is a good treasure, don't tell anyone else!"</p>
<p>But Ming'er was just a child after all, and was naturally straightforward and honest. It wasn't long before he told others. So it spread from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred, and the whole village knew!</p>
<p>"Ming'er, what does your treasure look like?"</p>
<p>"Show it to us!"</p>
<p>From then on, many people came to surround him every day.</p>
<p>Finally, because he couldn't resist them, he finally took out the pearl for them to see!</p>
<p>"Wow! How bright!"</p>
<p>"It's really a treasure!"</p>
<p>"I wish it were mine!"</p>
<p>Everyone squeezed over, pushing and shoving, crowding around Ming'er in the center, making it hard for him to breathe. Gradually, it became a disturbance. Many with malicious intentions even wanted to snatch his pearl. He quickly ran away, and many people chased after him. Finally, they caught up with him. In his anxiety, he put the pearl in his mouth and swallowed it.</p>
<p>The people dispersed!</p>
<p>Helpless, he returned home. His mother complained to him, but he didn't respond. After a while, he felt very thirsty. His mother gave him a bowl of water, and he swallowed it hungrily. However, he was still terribly thirsty, so he went to the water tank to drink, and soon he finished it! Unable to think of a solution, he had to take a bucket himself to draw water from the river. When he got to the river, he drew water into the bucket, and drank it all on the way back. Finally, he lay on the riverbank and drank, drinking endlessly. Gradually, he seemed to feel a pain in his head. He touched it and was shocked. Two horns had grown on his head. He looked into the river and saw that it was no longer his original face. He began to understand what had happened to him, and his heart filled with sorrow, but he still couldn't help but drink. Finally, his clothes fell off, and scales grew all over his body. He wanted to cry, but he couldn't. He thought of his dear mother, he wanted to shout loudly, but the sound wouldn't come out!</p>
<p>The sun slowly set in the west, heavily as if it already knew that this tragic scene was coming, the birds' songs also changed to a desolate tone, and the angry wind began to howl.</p>
<p>His mother hadn't seen Ming'er return for a long time, so she went outside to look for him. When she reached the riverbank, she saw only his clothes piled on the shore. Ming'er had already turned into a small dragon in the water, nodding to her.</p>
<p>"Ming'er! My Ming'er!" the mother cried and shouted, but what was the use?</p>
<p>The small dragon gradually grew larger, reluctantly shedding tears, always looking at his mother and nodding, unable to control himself as he swam down the river. Every time he turned his head to look at his mother, a huge wave would rise. He sadly looked at his mother twenty-four times, raising twenty-four large waves, and then gradually disappeared from sight!</p>
<p>The mother seemed to feel everything around her spinning and turning upside down. A wave of dizziness washed over her, and she fell down.</p>
<p>Industry Survey</p>
<h3>The Ramie Cloth Industry in Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Ramie cloth - a type of hemp fabric, called "ma bu" (hemp cloth) in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Sichuan ramie cloth is pure white in color, and does not "turn yellow" even when old, so the quantity sold is much larger than that produced in other provinces, and the value is also more expensive. In addition to Yunnan, Guizhou, Shanghai, Hankou and other places within the country, Korea is also a major market for its sales.</p>
<p>There are several counties in Sichuan that produce ramie cloth, such as Jiangjin, Longchang, Rongchang, Anle, and Lezhi, but Anle has the largest output, and Longchang ramie cloth is the most famous. This is partly because the quality produced in Longchang itself is better, and partly because Longchang is the main place where ramie cloth is shipped out of Sichuan. Therefore, when it comes to Sichuan ramie cloth, Longchang is always the representative, and even the sales signs say "Longchang."</p>
<p>The use of ramie cloth can be divided into two types: (1) clothing material and (2) mosquito nets. The former is more refined and the manufacturing process is very complicated, so the value is more than ten times higher than that of ramie cloth for mosquito nets. At the same time, not only is there a difference in value between the two, but each type can also be divided into seven or eight grades. Taking ramie cloth for clothing as an example: the highest grade can be sold for more than fifty yuan per bolt (each bolt can sew about two men's long gowns), and the lowest grade is about three or four yuan. As for ramie cloth for mosquito nets, each bolt is forty-eight feet long, and the price ranges from more than thirty yuan to more than two yuan. This is naturally based on the current market price in Shanghai, and sometimes the market price changes with different sales channels.</p>
<p>Because Longchang's ramie cloth has more sales markets, major cities in the south such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, Hong Kong, Kunming, and Guiyang all have wholesale outlets. The opening season is always after late spring and continues until mid-autumn. Because new ramie cloth just comes on the market after late spring, and when it cools down in autumn, ramie cloth loses its function and significance.</p>
<p>Sichuan ramie cloth merchants who set up outlets in Shanghai are called the "Longchang Gang." They do about a million yuan of business every year. The people who manage the outlets are called "zhuang ke," and they represent local stores in Shanghai to sell goods! Ramie cloth is sent by mail from Sichuan. The "zhuang ke" receive the goods and wholesale them to other "zhuang ke." However, there is little direct contact between sellers and buyers. All are mediated by "hang ke," and all money handling is also done by "hang ke."</p>
<p>In previous years, ramie cloth sold very well because many people from Korea came to Shanghai to transport it, so the Sichuan ramie cloth merchants (the so-called "Longchang Gang") were all doing very well. However, in the past two or three years, sales have gradually stagnated, and the value has gradually declined. Especially this year, the market is even more tired. It is currently the hot summer season, and in theory, ramie cloth should be in high demand, but the market price still cannot rise, and it is difficult to sell even at cost. The so-called "Longchang Gang" are mostly sitting in their stores, sighing. When they see their business losing money and there is no way to save it!</p>
<p>The ramie cloth shipped from Sichuan to Shanghai is all mosquito net material, because mosquito nets are essential in tropical and temperate regions, and mosquito nets made of ramie cloth allow better air circulation, so sales are higher. As for clothing material, partly because the cost is too high, and partly because few people outside wear ramie cloth, most merchants do not dare to purchase this item. In the past, a bolt of ramie cloth for mosquito nets could earn a quarter of the profit after all costs, but now it is actually losing money! When the market is depressed and all industries are declining, where will the ramie cloth industry go if it doesn't follow the trend?</p>
<p>The raw material of ramie cloth is called ramie (zhu ma), which can be harvested three times a year! Spring, summer, and autumn. The families who grow ramie take the ramie stalks home, and the women and children strip the stalks, soak the skins in clear water tanks, and after a certain period of time, they take them out of the water to air dry. Then, they pull them into ramie fibers, and then the ramie fibers are pulled into ramie threads. These threads are purchased by weaving families or factories, woven into large batches of cloth, and then the ramie cloth merchants collect these cloths and transport them for sale in various places. There are many shops in Longchang that buy ramie cloth. According to a survey, there are roughly 30,000 yuan in transactions every day. In such a small city, such a large-scale business can be considered a unique phenomenon—</p>
<p>The skin of ramie is originally green, but after it is pulled into ramie thread, it appears slightly yellow because it has been soaked in water and air-dried. Therefore, after the cloth is woven, it must go through a complicated "bleaching" process: every morning before the sun rises, the ramie cloth is spread out on the lawn to absorb dew, and after the sun comes out and dries it, clean river water is sprinkled on it again. This is "processed in the same way" every day to gradually whiten the color of the cloth. After half a month, it becomes shiny and beautiful ramie cloth.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>However, this is for mosquito net ramie cloth. If it is for clothing, it is even more troublesome: when pulling ramie, fine workmanship is required to twist it into strong and delicate ramie threads. Naturally, there should be more warps when weaving, and the warps should be even, so that it is "not leaking" and "not showing stems". Only then can it be called top-grade ramie cloth. At the same time, after the cloth is woven, it must be transported to the river in Rongchang to soak. Because ramie cloth is particularly white after being eroded by the water in the Rongchang River, ramie cloth from nearby counties must be transported there to be polished. Every summer, this river is particularly lively, and this is how ramie cloth merchants are improving production.</p>
<p>The value of top-grade ramie cloth is several times higher than that of silk, partly because the texture of the cloth itself is better than silk, and also because it has undergone a complicated process. We often see others wearing a ramie cloth shirt and think it is ordinary, but little do we know that it is the result of the combined efforts of many people!</p>

<h3>Humanity's Achievements in Conquering the Earth</h3>
<p>— Yu Min</p>
<p>Discovering and conquering the Earth we live on is not an easy task, as it has many natural obstacles and difficulties that prevent humanity from understanding it. The most obvious of these difficulties are, of course, the excessively vast area of ​​the oceans, which are difficult to fly across; the obstruction of high mountains and deserts inside the mainland; and the limitation of excessively harsh climates, etc. Although humanity has now overcome the first two obvious difficulties in its hundreds of thousands of years of effort, the latter difficulty has not yet been completely overcome. Therefore, explorers of the polar regions are still working hard there, risking their lives. These natural difficulties and obstacles can only be overcome with the development of scientific technologies that can fully utilize the laws of nature, so this depends on the progress of human production methods and technology. And looking at the process of human discovery and conquest of the Earth, it is also adapted to production technology, and is by no means simply the result of curiosity and adventurousness. Without the progress of shipbuilding, you would not be able to fly across the ocean no matter how adventurous and curious you were, and the discovery of the new continent of America would have been impossible.</p>
<p>In terms of the separate existence of human beings on Earth, of course, human discovery of the Earth's regions has been known for a long time. However, if we are to talk about the discovery and conquest of the entire Earth by the residents of a certain region, then this achievement must be attributed to Europeans. Therefore, in terms of the overall process of understanding the Earth, it is proper to take the breadth of the scope of the discovery and conquest of it by Europeans as the process of the development of human geographical knowledge of the Earth.</p>
<p>Primitive people all believed that the land on Earth was a flat surface with edges. If you reached its edge, you would fall and not know where you died. Therefore, no one dared to try to explore the vastness of the Earth, and they all only wandered around the regions where they lived. If we take the Western nations as the center and talk about the discovery and conquest of the Earth, then among the most ancient nations, the first to be mentioned is the Phoenicians, for whom there is reliable evidence to know how large the area of ​​the land they discovered was. Of course, as far as the distribution of world races is concerned, it is said that the Chinese also came from the West, and even the American aborigines migrated there before the Bering Strait was formed, but this is only a primitive anthropological speculation, and not something that can be known based on the records of human cultural history. Although the Phoenicians lived in the extreme east of the Mediterranean, they had conquered lands in southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula. Of course, they would have been active in places like northern Egypt and the Babylonian region. At that time, the world they knew was only that big. The next was the Greek era. The Greeks not only knew everything that the Phoenicians knew, but they also reached the Balkans in the north, the source of the Nile in Africa, and even the Sahara. They also occasionally explored the edge of the Black Sea and the Russian Plain. The famous Alexander marched as far as Persia and India, and knew the borders of Turkestan and Guangdong, China. This was a greater expansion of the land discovered by the Phoenicians. The regions known by the early Romans naturally included everything known by the Greeks. And they also conquered Britain, expanding to the westernmost part of Europe. In Africa, they occupied places like present-day Morocco. It is said that the Romans at this time already had contact with China, and thus even knew a part of East Asia. If we want to summarize, then we can take the area conceived by Ptolemy as the area discovered by the ancient European nations, as the representative of the breadth of the world they knew at that time. He took the Mediterranean as the center, westward to the island of Great Britain, northwest to the Scandinavian Peninsula, north to the Russian Plain, east to the borders of India and southern China, and south to the upper Nile and Sudan. But on the ocean, it only reached the coasts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, Westerners, with the brave exploration of the Western Ocean by sailors from Scandinavia in the north, already knew about Iceland and Greenland, and even reached the eastern edge of Canada or the United States. This was the first time they had crossed the Atlantic Ocean. In the south, the Muslim Arabs, in order to spread the teachings of Muhammad, crossed the interior of Africa and advanced to the islands of the extreme southeast. To the west, they advanced to Europe and clashed with the Crusaders. At this time, Marco Polo, a citizen of Venice, had been to China. Through this, he knew about Japan, and on his way back, he passed through Singapore. In this way, the world known by humans in the Middle Ages can be said to have reached Greenland in the northwest, and even the border between Canada and the United States in America, reaching as far as the middle of Africa in the south, and reaching Japan and Singapore in the east.</p>
<p>Since the Renaissance, the theory that the Earth is spherical has been confirmed, and the enthusiasm for discovering new continents and new routes, stimulated by the demands of commerce and colonies, has become even more developed. In 1486, the Portuguese Diaz sailed to the Cape of Good Hope, and then crossed Africa by sea to India. The approximate outline of Africa was then fully known. In 1492, Columbus crossed the Atlantic and discovered the new continent of America. In 1519, the Portuguese Magellan began his circumnavigation of the world, traveling west from Europe to America, then around the southern tip of South America, across the Magellan Strait to the Pacific Ocean, and discovered the Philippines. Although Magellan died at the hands of the local aborigines, his companions completed his world voyage in 1522. In the 17th century, not only was the interior of North and South America continuously discovered, but most of it was also occupied by the Portuguese and Spanish. Summing up the Renaissance era, the known area of ​​the Earth was more than three times larger than before.</p>
<p>Since the 17th century, European countries have been restrained by revolutionary trends and wars. At this time, only the Netherlands continued its exploration of the interior of South Africa. However, between 1785 and 1791, the French went deep into the northern islands of Japan. Between 1768 and 1771, the British also discovered the Hawaiian Islands, Australia, and reached the Southern Ocean. In the 19th century, the main development was towards the interior of Asia and Africa. On the American side, Canada and the United States gradually expanded to the Pacific coast, and on the Australian side, the British gradually discovered the entire continent. In Africa, between 1861 and 1877, the British explored the sources of the Nile; between 1871 and 1885, Americans and Italians discovered the Congo Basin; and between 1861 and 1879, the British explored the situation in southern Africa and its major lakes. In Asia, the French began to invade Annam, the British went deep into India, and all Europeans concentrated their efforts on penetrating China to the interior. The sea route from north to west between America and Europe was successfully tested by Norwegians in 1906, and the sea route from north to east between Europe and Asia was also discovered by Norwegians between 1876 and 1879. The understanding of the Arctic is the result of exploration by the British, Americans, and Norwegians, especially the discoveries of the Norwegians between 1893 and 1896, and the Americans reaching the Arctic Circle in 1909, which are the most important. As for the Antarctic, the discovery of it was only in the 20th century. The most important were the British expeditions in 1902 and 1910, and the Norwegians reaching the South Pole in 1911. There are almost no secret places on the Earth's surface that have not been reached by humans. If there are any, they are only a few areas in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles, and only the highest peaks of the Pamir Plateau. However, last year and the year before, Soviet expeditions also made new record discoveries in the Arctic, and American expeditions discovered new land in the Antarctic. There are many explorers who are continuing to work hard there, regardless of the sacrifice of their lives! With the development of modern production technology, those secret areas are also nowhere to hide, with the most advanced icebreakers and airplanes attacking from both land and sea. Almost every point of the entire area of ​​the Earth has actually been captured in the eyes of humans. The ability of humans to conquer nature is truly great!</p>

<h3>How to Write Short Stories</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>While the essence of a short story doesn't fundamentally differ from that of a novel or novella, it does possess certain distinct characteristics. Without these specific traits, it couldn't be considered an independent form of fiction, nor could it be called a short story. Hamilton, in his "Short Story Law," defined a short story in this way: "The purpose of a short story is to evoke a unique narrative emotion with the greatest economy and the most compelling force." In his view, the so-called "narrative emotion" contains three elements: "action, characters, and setting." Although this definition superficially and partially states the characteristics of a short story, it is too abstract and technical to give us a clear concept of what a short story truly is. Frankly speaking, a simple definition cannot encompass everything about a short story because it is a branch of literature and a form of fiction. Besides possessing the general characteristics of literature and fiction, it has its own particular qualities.</p>
<p>However, what we urgently need to tell our readers here are the characteristics of a short story and the rules for writing one. What the essence of literature is and what the definition of fiction is don't seem to be the issues we should address here. Therefore, we don't want to start with literature and fiction and then talk about short stories, nor do we want to mechanically define a short story and then tell everyone how to write one. What we want to do is explain the characteristics of a short story and how to write one. This, hopefully, will be of some benefit to readers who want to or are beginning to learn how to write short stories.</p>
<p>First, there's the issue of subject matter. The subject matter that short stories adopt is, of course, like that of novels, social phenomena and stories of life. However, because short stories have a limited number of words, they cannot take large and complex stories as their subject. What they depict are certain corners of social phenomena! Small fragments of life. Complex subject matter like that adopted by Balzac in "The Human Comedy," Flaubert in "Madame Bovary," Zola in "The Rougon-Macquart series," Tolstoy in "War and Peace," and our own "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Water Margin," etc., is absolutely unsuitable for short stories. Writers who are good at writing short stories take simple stories as their subject and describe life in a very concise yet detailed way.</p>
<p>However, while the subject matter of a good short story is a small fragment of life, this small fragment is a major life phenomenon existing in its era and society. Great short story writers have sharp eyes. They can see various important life phenomena in their era and society and can find stories and characters representative of those life phenomena to use as subject matter, and then vividly depict them. Therefore, the works they write can resonate with the majority of people and have great value. For example, the subject matter of Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" is a major social phenomenon in Chinese society during the Xinhai Revolution and the May Fourth Movement. The so-called "Ah Q-esque" life was the life of ordinary, muddle-headed, and sometimes self-important peasants in China at that time. Lu Xun seized this important social phenomenon of the era, taking Ah Q's life as the center, and vividly depicted it, so he achieved great success. Of course, the success of Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" is mainly due to his anti-feudal ideology and his sharp, satirical style, but the subject matter he adopted and his ideology and descriptive methods are greatly related.</p>
<p>From this, it seems that if you want to write a short story, you must first pay attention to the main social phenomena and use stories that represent these social phenomena as subject matter to start your creation. For example, in China at present, the main social phenomena are: rural bankruptcy, the decline of industry and commerce, unemployment and lack of education, the poverty of general life, and the resulting suicides and murders, as well as the "Rudinization" and "Hamletization" of most intellectuals, etc. If you want to write short stories, you must take a small but important fragment of these phenomena as subject matter and take a small fragment of the important real stories existing in these phenomena to construct your story. In this way, what you write will be noticed by everyone and will not be regarded as fabricating rumors or "playing at the extreme" for no reason.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of your thoughts. You know, literature loves truth. If you want to write a good short</p>

<h3>From Elementary to Intermediate</h3>
<p>— Ms. Liang</p>
<p>Dear Brother: Every time I pick up my pen to write to you, I feel an indescribable excitement.</p>
<p>I completely agree with the criticisms in your last letter. You said that reading too diffusely is the same as not reading at all. Indeed, I made this mistake in the past, and now I am willing to follow the reading plan you devised for me and proceed step by step.</p>
<p>With your help and that of other friends, I feel that I have made a lot of progress in the past six months. I remember when we parted for the last time, you said, "If you can't grasp life, you'll be crushed by it." I didn't understand its meaning at the time, but now I completely understand it! I want to be someone who grasps life. I want to fight. Brother, you watch.</p>
<p>You advised me to spend the time I used to spend reading miscellaneous books learning "Esperanto," and I did as you said. I attend the morning class of the Esperanto Association, which has been going on for more than a month. The location is in the alley across from the Carter Road Post Office, which is not too far from our factory. Recently, the factory extended working hours to eleven hours, and we have to start work at seven in the morning. My study time was resolved by getting the consent of the supervisor to move one hour in the morning to the evening. Although physically tired, I am very happy in spirit because I have already started to read some basic books and newspapers. Recently, the Esperanto Association has also held a summer class, and I have continued to join the intermediate level. Several friends saw how easy it was for me to learn Esperanto, and they also want to join the elementary research.</p>
<p>Will you still allow me to communicate in Esperanto in the future?</p>
<p>Mr. H, the teacher of our morning class, is an old classmate of yours. I have learned a lot of knowledge about various aspects from him. His language level is very good, and he is now starting to translate a collection of works of various small European ethnic groups from Esperanto, which will probably be published in September. In the future, he also plans to translate the Esperanto version of the famous Soviet film "Chapayev" into Chinese and has reserved me to help. I am of course very happy, so I am working hard to learn. You know that I have only been learning for more than forty days from the beginning until today, but I am already preparing to translate this large work of 200,000 words. Don't you think this is too ambitious?</p>
<p>Through Esperanto correspondence, I have met many honest friends at home and abroad who help and encourage me like you! My brother helps me and encourages me.</p>
<p>If you have the opportunity to come to Shanghai to see me, you must be happy for my gradual transformation into strength and courage, my brother!</p>
<p>Looking at the silent night outside the window and the twinkling stars, I seem to see your eyes burning with the fire of truth and hear the sound of your heart beating. The distance of space can never separate the resonance of our spirits, brother!</p>
<p>Waiting for your reply, I bless you and your career!</p>
<p>Sister, late night, July 11</p>

<p>Story, you must not only take that important fragment as the subject matter, but also describe this fragment very realistically. But to describe this fragment of life very realistically, your subjective thoughts must be in line with the objective life phenomena—you can recognize the true essence of objective life phenomena. If your subjective thoughts are not in line with objective life phenomena, and you cannot recognize its reality, then you have no way to describe it very realistically, so the works you write will inevitably not be very successful. Poe said: "A skillful artist has constructed a tale. If wise, he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents; but having conceived, with deliberate care, a certain unique or single effect to be wrought out, he then invents such incidents -- he then combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect...." This really represents the words of people who fear the truth! If you write short stories according to this statement, then you don't care about objective facts, but only for your own private interests, you "invent incidents" based on your own subjectivity, even embellish reality, and create rumors. Is there still value in such works? If a person who is not afraid of objective reality, his own needs and thoughts are in line with the objective reality and needs, then he will not "invent incidents" or "accommodate facts." Under his understanding, the subject matter he adopts, the facts and thoughts he expresses, must be consistent with objective reality. Therefore, if you want to recognize objective reality and describe objective life phenomena very realistically, you must not be afraid of the truth, bravely approach objective reality, and stand in front of those who are not afraid of objective reality. If you work hard to write your short stories in this way, you will definitely make progress day by day.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the matter of descriptive methods. Because short stories have a limited number of words and limited subject matter, they must be written particularly concisely, without a single word of nonsense, and without using too many or too few words. All the overly long memories, extravagant narrations, excessive dialogues, and preachings in novels are things that should be avoided when writing short stories. Imagine, if Maupassant, when writing "The Necklace," wanted the woman who borrowed the necklace to go to a banquet to imagine all sorts of things after losing the necklace and compensating others with a huge amount of money, and to show all kinds of lives she went through, or even when she finally knew that the necklace she lost was fake, to create all kinds of pain and regret, or even to make a very long memory, then I dare say that "The Necklace" would definitely not be as good as it is, so amazing and admired. Those who are good at writing short stories pay great attention to the center of the thoughts or stories they express. They are good at tailoring, and anything that is not directly related to that center will be omitted by him. He just grasps that center and vividly describes it. Look, how rigorous is Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q"? It can be said that there is not a single word that can be added or subtracted! This is a good short story. As for describing the story, whether to start from the end and trace back to the beginning? To start from the middle and unfold the whole story? Or to write from beginning to end? This can be up to you, it doesn't matter much. However, generally speaking, it is still good to write from beginning to end, especially when first learning to write short stories. At the same time, although the story described is very small, although it is a small fragment of life, it must still be linked to general phenomena when writing, to explain this small fragment from general phenomena, and to use this small fragment to prove general phenomena. For example, if you want to use the story of a young person who commits suicide due to unemployment or unrequited love as the subject matter, then you should not write from an individualistic point of view, but should describe it from a social point of view, to show the nature of the current society. Only in this way will others feel that you are telling the truth, and your work can move people, and thus have greater value.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in the World (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>At the same time, capitalism in Europe and the United States was still developing at that time. Phenomena such as economic recession and unemployment panic had not yet occurred. All places and industrial sectors needed a large amount of labor. The Chinese people had developed a "natural" spirit of hard work and endurance in their past commercial and agricultural social lives, which was suitable for the needs of European and American countries. Therefore, European and American countries often came to China to recruit Chinese laborers, and transported many mobile Chinese citizens overseas in batches. Furthermore, when capitalism in Europe and the United States was developing rapidly, there was an urgent need to open up markets and find natural resources: places such as Africa and Southeast Asia were areas with very abundant natural resources. Therefore, the forces of advanced European and American countries arrived in Africa and Southeast Asia one after another. However, Africa and Southeast Asia have always been relatively remote, and the population is very sparse. To develop their resources and prosper their markets requires not only a lot of labor, but also an increase in population. Thus, the hardworking Chinese people aroused great attention from the advanced European and American countries. In the past, there was a governor of the Dutch East Indies named Coen who left such an opinion to his successor when he stepped down: (To be continued)</p>
