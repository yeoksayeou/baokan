<p>— 庭</p>
<p>美政府購買白銀政策。自一九三三年與中國印度加拿大等締結恊定。迄於今。茲曾使紐約銀價每　盎斯由三角餘漲至七角以。上使倫敦銀價每標準益斯由十八便士左右漲至三十便士以。上在此期間用銀國家如中國與墨西哥等。無不受存銀流出通貨緊縮之禍害。卽其他國家如英日法荷此亦同感。匯價漲落不定之苦。銀政策對於世界經濟之影響。可謂深且烈矣。</p>
<p>日前。海外電訊傳來。美國白銀派新領袖湯姆士痛斥政府購銀政策。謂政府目的只在以可能的最低價格收買白銀。並非欲以銀爲眞正貸幣。且指斥著名銀派頒袖畢特門。謂其非銀派發言人。而美參議院則定國會閉幕後分派湯姆士等委員赴歐亞及南美三洲調査白銀狀况。以備來年一月國會重開時作成立白銀新法之努力。同時畢特門亦提議組織五人委員會。會同財長調査銀政策對於國內外之影饗。此兩委員會各自爲謀顯有對立形勢。可見美白銀派內部矛盾之深烈。至美財部方面最近對購銀法案之執行。其態度與當初頗有不同。尤値吾人注意者也。</p>
<p>夫購銀法案之最大目標。本爲造成美國金銀複本位之制度。卽使美國發行紙幣之正貨準備達於金三銀一之比例。當時案內規定雖爲許可式而非命令式其原則固已成立無疑。當法案成立時。紐約銀市猶盤旋於四五角之間國內牛銀價格仍爲六角四分半。其後銀派人士多方接洽。希圖抬高生銀價格至一元二角九分。甚且欲達到金銀十六與一之比價卽使白銀定價爲二元角八分（按自一九三三年美元貶價以後。金價每盎斯爲美金三十五元故銀價須達此數。方符十六與一之比）。而美財部卒將國內生銀價格一再提高至七角七分五厘七毫。雖去白銀派人士所鼓吹之限度猶遠。然其對于購銀法案之執行。究不能謂其無相當誠意。乃自近二三月以。來財部之活動於世界白銀市塲。顯已不若前此之積極。而畢特門調査委員會之組織。尤足證示購銀法案之躊躇。果如湯姆士所言。政府無以銀爲眞正貨幣之誠意。則白銀法案中金銀複本位之原則。不將自是中北耶。</p>
<p>以吾人觀察。美國金銀複本位之運動。本爲銀派人士所發動。未　有全美廣大利益之基礎存乎其間。蓋以不滿美金千萬元之白銀生產價値。作爲美國一切價値漲落之標準。揆之今日美國之國民經濟。非但事實上殊不可能。抑亦未　有絕對之需要。故所謂金銀複本位運動。實可謂爲銀派人士之一種錯覺。且銀派人士鑒于國內外情形之變化。今乃自行降低所標榜之白銀定價爲每盎斯一元。冀能最後成爲法定貨幣。已有知難而退之勢。他日畢德門及湯姆士等出發調査。獲有相當結果。則美銀政　前途。自必有更重大之變化。可斷言也。</p>

<h3 id="c77">孔令瑢談　黃河堵口困難　大水無所歸應亟謀宣洩　蘇省築堤堵截完全失策 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>濟南通信、鄄城黃河自七月十日决口、大水東趨、在鄆城之王老虎集分流、南入南陽湖、北入東平湖、（卽東平低水窪）復歸正河、蘇北恐受大水波及、除修微湖大堤外、並堵塞藺家壩、以防大水南侵、惟以决口水勢太大、來源正旺、流入南陽昭陽蜀山等湖、因受江蘇之阻、不能宣洩、汜濫四溢、連日來不特湖東岸之滕縣澤縣紛紛决口、灌淹津浦路、卽蘭家壩亦被冲决、水灌徐州、蘇北阻水官洩計劃、乃完全失敗、近更築擋水壩、守第三道防綫、水勢演變、尙未知至若何程度、山東運河工程局長孔令瑢、近對蘇魯水災、擬有意見發表、痛論目前之計、惟有亟謀宣洩、遵照經委會防黃會議决案、導水由正路入海、對蘇北之堵截、證明其失策、倘果仍舊堅持、阻水去路、魯西災區擴大、蘇北亦捲入洪流、切斷津浦隴海兩路、導淮工程亦完全摧毀無餘、該意見原文洋洋數千言、論列甚祥、現正在文字修正、茲紀錄其要點如下、</p>
<p>目前堵口困難</p>
<p>黃河决口後、因河床漸高、堤外地勢低窪、水性就下、一瀉千里、决口水量佔全部水勢十分之九、正河之水不過十分之一、自經二次大水、口門史有劇烈之變化、大溜東滾、原有一二三四各口門完全淤塞、正河則涉水可過、黃河挾帶多量泥沙、以洪水時爲最多、淤墊亦最甚、現在之正河、以形勢推測、恐被完全噴淤、水由口門洩出、演成改道之局面、且時當洪水時期、河水漲落靡定、溜勢亦必迭有變化、口門之將來、未必不再變更其形勢、至於堵口工作、因欵料兩缺、進行甚遲、目前舖岔道由蘭封至東壩頭、一方準備船隻、運送料物、至少需四個月始能運齊、再挑拕引河、减少口門水量、始能着手堵口、現在只能作運料·挑引河·堵旱口·作裹頭等工作、</p>
<p>江蘇阻水失策</p>
<p>據現在測量、决口之水較海面高出五十四公尺、（以江淮入海海口爲基點）距此十日以前測量　山湖水面低於决口水二十公尺、連日漲水、水位增高、較决口水亦當低十八公尺、以此證明江蘇築堤乃完全失策、除築堤再增高十八公尺、始能阻决口水南浸、然而事實上又不可能、因築堤再加高、蘇北豐沛必被淹、魯西一隅乾土之單縣城武、亦將沉於波底也、至於韓莊閘水位現已達三十六公尺三寸餘、十五年大水時水位爲三十六公尺五寸、兩相比較僅差一公寸餘、水大勢猛、冲决蘭家壩與韓莊閘、乃爲必然之勢、現在大水由决口處冲出、其流量爲五千秒立方公尺、流入災區、其勢稍穩、流量約爲二千六百秒立方公尺、水大如此、流速如此、不能正路宣洩、勢必汜濫、江蘇不知導引該水入海、只知堵截、卒至蘇北受空前水災、已可證明其以前政策完全失敗矣、</p>
<p>應謀導引宣洩</p>
<p>現在欲謀根本减蘇魯水災、惟有堵口、但堵口現時不可能、目前要務、應速研究導引官洩、辦法約有數端、（一）掘藺家壩導水入不老河、培修不老河南堤、由不老河入中運河、培修運河東堤、瞿塘集以下中運河修外堤、再經六搪河宣洩入海、其能力約可洩一千秒立方公尺、由韓莊湖口閘導水入中運河、亦入六塘宣洩入海、其能力可洩六百秒立方公尺、（二）决口水北股經朿平積水產宣洩入黃河、其能力爲四百秒立方公尺、由宋金河洩入黃河、其能力爲六百秒立方公尺、綜計以上水由南北兩路洩出數量爲二千六百秒立方公尺、與决口水流量無甚懸殊、水勢當可不再汜濫、（三）由豐縣黃河故道入手向北修築南北行大堤一道、長三百里、阻止黃水向西汜濫、（四）徐北黃河故道酌留口門數個、作成裹頭、亦可消納一部分、亦可减少徐淮汜濫區域、</p>

<p>有一次他的祖母被邀來晚餐的時候，他將組白的河卵石放在塊塘盆裏，——可憐這老太太奇怪得爲什麼這些在她的杯裏不會溶解，可是她是素嫻禮儀的，所以又不願說什麽話。他有一次在禮拜堂裏將鼻烟瓶一路傳遞過去，所以其中有五個童子打嚏得這麼利害，他們不得不急急退席·冬天他在雪裏掘了一條小徑，却秘密地又澆上冷水，不久走路的人就要東跌西倒了。他幾乎使可憐的賴司務發了瘋，因爲他高懸着賴司務的一雙大靴子在一個惹人注意的去處，賴司務的脚原是碩大無朋的，而這也正是他所最不願人知道的。他勸那個好好的小稻里縛一根綫於他的一個搖動的牙齒，入睡時任那根綫的一頭宕在他的口外，這樣可讓韜摩爲他拔去，可以不感到那施行手術的痛苦。然而那牙齒當第一次被牽時，並不落下來，可憐的稻里在痛苦中驚醒了，從那天起就沒有對韜摩的信用了。最後的一次惡作劇是故意將麵包浸在酒裏，取來喂母鷄，使她們頭昏顚倒，別的家禽見而却走，因爲那些素來莊嚴的老母鷄一朝竟跌跌衝衝，瘋瘋顚顚，啄着啼着，全家的人看見這些奇形怪相，部笑得不可開交，直到小梅矜憐了她們，關她們在鷄籠裏來睡去她們的酩酊。</p>
<p>這些便是這裏的童子，他們共同生活在一起倒也十分愉快，他們共同修學，游戯，工作，吵架，戰勝過失，和培養德性。別的學校的孩子書本知識容或較多，然而講到所以使人們成爲好人的知解或識見，怕便不如這裏了。文字和數學固然也是佷好，祗不過在裴爾敎授的意思，自知，自助，和自制，是更加重要，而且他確也仔仔細細去敎他們這些。別人有時談到他的主張，儘搖着頭，縱然他們也承認孩子們在待人接物的行爲和禮儀上，確有異常的進步。不過我們自然應得知道，正如蜀太太對乃德所說，這本是一個「希奇古怪的學校」呀。</p>

<p>— （隱湖）</p>
<p>吾們看見一個人，辦好一件事業，大多數須要經過數十年的歷程，才能發展。這種發展原因，一定從積成的經騐，多時的請練上得來：現在政治人物，每每幾個月就有調動。要想收獲良好的結果，當然爲難。</p>
<p>人情薄如秋雲。是一句形容世態炎凉的話；其實人情，一定要比秋雲薄得多。</p>
<p>現在的人情最是變幻不測，夏天的雲，比任何時候的雲，來得會變。人情幻如夏雲。却是很好的　喻。</p>
<p>現在不論做什麼事，都要講資格。其實有資格的人，不一定有才幹，有才幹的人，倘然沒有經騐；所做的事，仍舊須要等到有經騐的時候；才能做得好。</p>
<h3 id="c146">紀穆郎 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>這是某年夏天的事吧，這時候，我跟幾個朋友，在北郭外××書院避暑，畫間看書着棋，夜間幾個朋友，划着一隻小艇，蕩漾湖中，只見山高月小，繁星滿點湖中，錦鱗潑刺水面，淸風徐來，凉爽宜人。朋友中有吹簫的，高歌的，此景此情，宛在目前，到了現在，那裏可以復得呢！</p>
<p>記得有一天傍晚，新雨初霽，山色猶如美人浴罷一般，湖畔捕魚蝦的人格外多。咱們也拿了釣竿在師古亭下釣魚。忽見一個少年，大袖布衣，手裏拿着一頂雨傘，緩步度橋而來，過了師古亭，逕到普濟寺裏去了。原來我們避暑的書院，跟普濟寺是貼鄰。寺裏有一個和尙，能做幾句詩，寫一手王字，　懂些少林拳，跟我們是常常往來談天的。這時候，我們瞧見那少年走進寺裏去，不覺有些希罕。</p>
<p>後來因和尙介紹，方纔知道這少年，姓穆，名耀樞，自號穆郞，是上海南洋公學的高材生。我們和他道欽慕之意，他口吃，訥訥然若拙於言語一般。他對於國學，很有根柢，英語也很精，還能够打幾套內家拳。但，外貌非常樸實，少年老成，似乎帶些土老兒氣，那裏知道是大學生呢。，</p>
<p>暑假已滿，我們都到學校裏去，和穆郞別了幾個月，一向沒有晤面，不過常有信札來往吧了。我們畢業的次年，接得穆郞結婚的喜帖，約了幾個朋友，到他家裏去喫喜酒。這時，賀客盈門，有西裝的學生，有光頭的和尙，有科舉時代的遺老，光怪陸離，煞是好看。吾鄉習俗，結婚之夕，新郞新婦，並肩而坐，伴着賀客喝酒，名叫「賀郞」。穆郞異想天開，竟拉着幾個和尙來賀郞，並把「和尙賀郞」做了酒令的題目，硬令賀客做首詩，新娘來斟酒，這可謂別開生面的賀郞。現在大名鼎鼎的太虛和尙，便是當　賀客之一。</p>
<p>過了幾年，有一天，偶閱日報，突見穆郞在四川被某軍閥槍斃的消息，委實非常驚駭。原來穆郎從南洋公學畢業後，輾轉做了成都某女校的校長。據某軍閥宣布的罪狀，是；穆郞和某女生，在敎室裏白晝宣淫。所以，便把他生生地槍斃了。</p>
<p>這是十年前的事吧？我至今還想着他呢！</p>

<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>據一個朋友吿訴我說：一小石子在從前本沒有什麽多大的用處，自水泥建築物流行以後，小石子就成了必需品了。」因此伊早有的等於廢物的一座石山，現在居然有人願出重價和伊訂立合同，組織了規模宏大的石礦公司，耤此貿利，這也許是伊夢想不到的罷？</p>
<p>一天朋友又很忠誠的吿訴我伊幼時關於小石子的一樁艷聞，伊說：「在靑年時代，因爲按捺不住靑春的火焰，四處找對象。數月以後，和娜發生了甜蜜的愛，可是娜的家庭很頑固，不許伊跨出閩門，俗諺說得好，壓迫愈厲害，反動的爆發愈强。一日在伊後樓的窗下徘徊，不，徘徊不止一次了。這一天可算得是幸運的一日，正仰着脖子向樓窗凝睇，忽然呀的一聲，窗門開了。見機會一到，馬上把藏在袋中預寫就的情書取出來，要傳遞給伊。伊放下了一根絲綫把信箋吊上去了。以後只要隨便在地上拾取一塊小石子，向瓦上一擲，伊就會把窗子打開的，如此來鴻去雁，經過了一個寒暑，兩人千方百計的竟達到了結婚的目的，當時一個朋友送來一副喜聯，內有「石子姻緣」的嵌句。』</p>
<p>現在伊還常在朋友面前禮讚石子是伊的功臣，婚姻的促成，有四個字可以代表。『抛磚引玉，』伊的夫人芳名却一個玉字呢。</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>我的朋友，他有一位鄰居，是放着高利貸爲生的。他的放債的種類，共有三種。第一種是十元以上的，（　通最高以二十元爲度），每元每月取　息一角。借的時候，十元的，只給九元，預扣利息一月，但借據上，得寫借洋二十元，以備涉訟時，仍可本利無虧。第二種是五元左右的，起一個摺子，每月連利帶本，收洋一元。收滿十個月，便將摺取消，作爲本利淸償。第三揮是一元二元的戶頭，也是立着摺子。例如向他借洋一元的，每天在一定的時刻，他到來時，便得交付利息銅子十枚，於是他便在摺上截一個小印子，作爲這一天的利息，已經收訖。</p>
<p>借第一種偵的，大致都是穿長衫的小職員，嫖賭得不濟了，向他借的。第二第三種的主顧，那幾乎完全是無知婦女和小販之類。他居然也用着四個跑街。借出一元，跑街得一角傭金。同時，他還有幾個同產弟兄，替他做打手，有賴債的，或是延付利息的，便由這幾個同產弟兄，去飽以老拳。好在打過之後，是不愁被打者不典妻　子而還債請客的。（行話叫做拉檯子。）</p>
<p>這個放高利債的，據說，在三年之前還是亦貧的。後來，他出着每月每元五分得利息，借了一百塊錢，混了三年，如今非但一百元已還清，每個月竟能收得一百二三十元的利息。他每天一淸早起身，便忙着出去討　收息，一直得到下午三四時回家。他說，再過九六年，可以不必再幹這買賣了。但是就是在目前，他的老婆，早已指上戴着金鋼鑽約指了。</p>

<p>於是滿臉放下笑容來道：剛才和我說話的，那是藍專員的秘書長裘則誠。他是我的胞姐夫，同我像親兄弟一樣。唯其是如此，頗有點老大哥的排塲。若是　家裏，我是不受他這一套的。不過現在我要求他向藍專員去找一封八行，這就沒有法子，只好受他的指揮了。賈多才！我聽你說藍專員和你是親戚，現在這麼着秘書長是你親戚呢？介夫紅了臉道：大概賈先生沒有聽淸楚。我原來，就說的秘書長是親戚。賈多才笑道：無論怎麽着，你也比我强。你看，我現在弄兩個廿肅逃難來的災民，當了親戚。他們說着話，走近了賈多才的房門口。　　　月　姑娘，也正自掀了一線門　縫，要看看這迎接中央大員的熱閙。聽了賈多才這種話，又是當了許多人的面，心裏委實不自在，立刻臉上慘白。所幸他還是藏身在門簾子裏的，不曾讓賈多才看見。張介夫也是心腸別有所在。賈多才的話，不怎麽留在心上。自己回到房裏去，關起房門來，磨墨展紙，行書帶草，寫了一封信，又把自己昨晩恭楷寫好的一封信，一齊用個大官封套着。（二九九）</p>

<p>事有凑巧，在四五年之前，當我們全家正住在巴黎的時候，我母親以及伊的幾位年老的朋友，都曾試用過西方的染髮藥，於是我就决意把它們來介紹給太后；其時我眞是太熱心了，竟不曾顧慮到萬一我所介紹的染髮藥也許並不能表顯什麽好的功效，我就難免要討一塲沒趣了。</p>
<p>「我們已曾派過許多人出去　覓過，」太后恰巧向我感嘆道：「希望能够覓到一種旣不傷損頭髮，也不致染汚頭皮的染髮藥，然而至今還不曾覓到，也許是永遠覓不到了！」</p>
<p>「奴才倒可以給太后找到這樣的一種染髮藥來！我忍不住就這樣的自吿奮勇起來。</p>
<p>伊老人家聽了，便微微一笑。</p>
<p>「想必總是你在那些西洋國裏瞧見的：本來西洋人是最靈巧不過的，他們所發明的東西，往神奇得像　法一樣。我仿佛也曾聽人家說過，他們有許多染髮的，可以隨着人的意思，染成各種顏色，不知道你所說的是那一種呢？」（三九九）</p>

<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>傷寒論中最不可通者結胸也，其論結胸之原因也，曰：「病發於陽而反下之熱入因作結胸……所以成結胸者，以下之太早故也」，又曰：「太陽病脈浮，而動數……醫反下之動數變遲膈內拒痛，胃中空虛，客氣動膈，短氣躁煩，心中懊檂，陽氣內陷，心下因硬則爲結胸一，又曰：「傷寒五六日嘔而發熱者，柴胡湯，證具而以他藥下之……若心下滿而硬痛者，此爲結胸也」，又曰：「太陽少陽併病而反下之成結胸」；此謂誤下，而成結胸也，又曰：「傷寒六七日　胸熱實」，此謂不必誤，下而亦成結胸也，如成無已，註曰：「此不云下後，而云傷寒，六七日則是傳變之實熱也」，張兼善註曰：「早下結胸，是之常熱，實結胸事之變」，程郊倩傷寒後條辦曰：「結胸……不必誤下，始成傷寒，六七日有竟成結胸者」，汪苓友辨證席註曰：「些言結胸證，亦有不因誤下而成者」，是皆以仲景此倏爲不因誤下而竟成結胸也，傷寒論又曰：「寒實結胸，無熱證者，與三物小陷胸湯白散亦可服」。宋板傷寒論此條下注云：「一云與三物小白散」。按註說是也，然亦衍小字，考玉函經及千金翼無陷胸湯，及亦可服六字，亦作「與三物小白散」，與註所謂一云者，合醫宗金鑑，亦謂「三物小陷胸湯當是三物白散」，尤在涇貫珠集，亦曰：「小陷胸湯及亦可服七字疑衍」，龐安時總病論作「與三物白散」，其下註日：「小陷胸者非也」，徐靈胎類方白散下注云：「按活人書云，與三物白散，無小陷胸湯，亦可用七字蓋，小陷胸寒劑，非無熱之所宜也」，玉函經乃傷寒論之別本，千金翼所載者，唐時之傷寒論也，朱奉議之活人書，龐安時之總病論，皆來時之物，其所載當可據，故當從之。而傷寒論中更無大白散，故玉函千金翼小白散之小字亦衍文也，當從活人書總病論爲是，此結胸亦非因早下而成，似與冷水選灌有關。總上觀之傷寒論所說結胸之起原，多因傷寒早下，亦　無其他原因，自熱發生者，熱實結胸是也，亦有自冷發生者，寒寶結胸是也。</p>
<p>其論結胸之證候也，曰；「按之痛寸脈浮關脈，沈名曰結胸也」又曰：「結胸者項亦強如柔痙狀」，又曰：結胸證其脈浮，大者不可下下之則死」，又曰：一結胸證悉具煩躁者亦死」，又日：「太陽病脈浮，而動數……醫反下之，動數變遲，膈内拒痛，胃中空虛，客氣動膈，短氣躁煩，心中懊憹，陽氣內陷，心下因硬，則爲結胸」，又曰：「結胸熱，實脈沈而緊，心下痛按之石硬」，又曰：「不大使五六日，舌上躁而渴，日晡所小有潮熱，從心下至少腹硬滿而痛不可近」，又曰：「小結胸病，正在心下，，按之則痛脈浮滑」。總上諾證觀之，其言脈不可憑，蓋寸　非有兩截，浮則俱，浮沉則俱沉，非有寸浮關沉之脈也，其中一心下至小腹硬滿而痛不可近」及「心下痛按之石硬」，爲其主證，凡傷寒因下之而得是證者，爲腸穿孔性腹膜炎，其病最凶，故明理論曰：「傷寒　惡結胸爲甚」，傷寒廣要曰：「傷寒　結胸爲惡證」，至於項强躁煩則侵入腦矣。故傷寒論曰：「躁煩者亦死」，尤在涇貫珠集日：「頸項强直結胸之甚者」，此乃爲穿孔性腹膜炎，而延爲腦膜炎也，傷寒之腸穿孔，不必因誤下而生，亦有自己發生者，傷寒論所謂結胸執實卽此也，其寒實結胸及小結胸則爲胃中障碍，而非穿孔性腹膜炎矣，又動數變遲，膈內拒痛，短氣躁煩，心中懊憹，則黄疸之前驅，證往往如此，頗有似於結胸。故曰：「陽氣內陷，心下因硬則爲結胸」，謂有此種前驅證，再進一步而心下作硬者則爲結胸也，其實傷寒發黄疸者往往有此仲景，見其不作結胸，而發黃疸也，故曰：「若不結胸……身必發黄」，此條實是黄疸證候，而仲景誤以爲將作結胸也。蓋結胸爲穿孔性腹膜炎，穿孔性腹膜炎脈必細數，故傷寒蘊要曰：「脈微細沈手足冷者皆難治也」，傷寒證治明條曰：「沈微細小者决難救矣」，而動數變遲實為黃疸之的證，以黃疸之脈多遲也，若穿孔性腹膜炎之脈變遲，則必進而　腦膜炎，或能如此，未有未成穿孔性腹膜炎之前，而脈先變遲也。</p>
<p>由原因證候兩者並勘，已知結胸之爲穿孔性腹膜火矣。穿孔性腹膜炎，惟用外科手術，滌盪穢汚，或有萬一回生之望，决非陷胸丸湯所能救治，其曰陷胸丸陷胸湯主之者，非治法也，且此病因下之而成，豈有再下而可愈之理，此吾所謂不可通也。</p>

<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>——醫學故事之八——</p>
<p>古希臘與古羅馬自稱爲自然哲學家的科學家，對於活着的身體的種種恒久的與不隨意的運動，常感到深切的典味。這些運動，一部分是他們從別人的身體方面看到的，一部分是他們在自己的身體方面覺知的。例如：呼吸時胸部加風箱樣兒的運動；他們視爲彼此不相關聯的心臟跳動與脈搏：當皮膚破裂的時候，便有血液滲出來或湧出來，好像皮膚本身滿貯血液似的。在腹部，他們也知感種種內部器官的運動，如腸的痙攣蠕與動，食物的移降等等。</p>
<p>這些客觀而明確的事實，當然是需要解釋的。對於當時的自然哲學家們，唯一可能方法是解剖動物的屍體。爲了宗敎的與社會的顧忌與拘束，他們不能考察人的屍體。他們又不能在解剖動物身體的時候使動物繼續活着，藉以察看各器官的眞實活動狀况。所謂實騐生理學，當時還不知道是什麽一回事。因此，他們從沒有生命的器官的解剖推論出來的有生命的器官的活動方式，多數是錯誤的。</p>
<p>在所有這些運動　，使他們最感興味的，是心臟與肺的運動，以及這些運動和血液的關係。從動物解剖，他們容易看出：在胸部與腹部中間，有一層橫隔膜隔離着：從身體進出的空氣，一是經過肺部的：心　緊附於　。他們不明瞭吸入的空氣　呼出的空氣的化學的變換，假定肺的功用？如扇一般冷却過熱的血液在靜脈管和右部心朦中，恒見黑色的血液：在左部心臟中，有時略見血液：但在動管中，他們看到的完全是空氣。因此他們設想：靜脈管把從肺部得　的血液運動至各部分組織，動脈管把從肺部得來的空氣運至各部分組織。</p>
<p>蓋冷Galen設想：心臟是體熱的資源，而血液則是助熱的燃料，他對自己提出一個問題，就是：爲什麽心臟右部與左部的血液會有不同的顏色與密度？他的解答是完全從想像得來的他假定：血液因穿過介於左右心室之間的隔膜上的細孔而給濾凈。他當然看不見這些細孔，但他說，你雖然看不見皮膚的細孔，却知道汗液從皮膚的細孔滲出。</p>
<p>這些關於血液循環的錯誤的意見，流行至數百年之久。使眞正的血液循環的學理得以確定，乃是哈佛Winiam　Harvey的功績。他的發見，是現代醫學與現代生物學的重要的基礎之一。在把提血液是循環全身的這個見解以後，人們纔能够推想：血液把從消化組織得來的滋養物，及從肺得來的氣，運至各部分組織，又把廢物與毒物運至腎臟，預備排出體外。</p>
<p>心臟推動血液這學理的確定，是很緩慢的。中世紀的權威的醫學界，都盲從蓋冷的學說。哈佛首先認知；血液由心臟推動而成一種循環全身的運動。他曾說：「我察看動物的跳動的心臟，起初設想心臟的運動只有上帝纔能理解，因爲心臟的收縮和擴張這麼急速，至於我一時看不出這收縮與擴張在什麽時候發生。」可是，他終於指示出來：（二）正在心臟收縮的同一瞬間。動脈管也跳動一次；（二）當動脈管破裂的時候，心臟收縮一次血液便迸出一次；（三）病人臨終的當兒，心　停止跳動，脈搏也同時停止。他的結論是這樣：血管分二組，輸血離心的是動脈，輸血入心的是靜脈：黑色靜脈的血進入心　右部，經過肺部，因新鮮空氣的作用變成鮮紅的血液，回至心臟左部，由動脈管輸至身體各部分。至於血液怎樣從動脈管走到靜脈管這個問題，須遲至九年後馬爾畢西Malpighi發明微血管—聯絡小動脈管與小靜脈管的纖細的血管—的時候纔告解决。</p>
<p>證明循環學說的第一有力的證據，是全身血液的貯量。根據實騐，心臟每跳動一次，排血四分之一盎斯。照此計算，在半小時中間，心　收縮一千次，就須排血十磅五盎斯。但全身的血量，平均僅七盎斯半：要是血液非循環的話，那就無法解决心臟排出血的量怎樣會超過全身血量這個問題了。</p>

<p>（六十五）急性限局性腹膜炎</p>
<p>（Acute　Circumscribed　Peritonitis）</p>
<p>問　什麽叫做急性限局性腹膜炎？</p>
<p>答　這是念性腹膜炎的一種，病患部限劃於腹膜的一局部而形成腫瘤或膿瘍的。</p>
<p>問　腹部所現的病狀，和急性廣泛性腹膜炎，有何區別？</p>
<p>答　腹部病狀，也和廣泛性的相同；但疼痛和壓痛，限局一處而就在該處構成腫瘤的起濁音和波動。</p>
<p>問　病人全身所現的病狀，和急性廣泛性腹膜炎，有何區別？</p>
<p>答　全身症狀，也很像急性廣泛性腹膜炎：可是程度較輕，大都發不整熱像弛張熱。</p>
<p>問　念性限局性腹膜炎的經過情形怎樣？</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>答　在病的經過中，若能吸收，就得治愈；若病勢遷延日子太久，就起全身襄弱，虛脫而死。或形成膿瘍。有的成　痕愈着和硬結；有的腹膜穿孔而起敗血症。</p>
<p>問　腹膜膿瘍發生的部位，比較重要的是什麽？</p>
<p>答　生在隔膜下的膿瘍，比較的重要。因爲若向右方擴充，使右肝葉，膽道，蚓突，或右腎續發膿瘍；若向左方侵犯，續發胃和十二指腸，左肝葉，脾，胰，左腎，或心囊等的膿瘍。</p>
<p>問　急性限局性腹膜炎的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　發病急性或潛行性，以惡寒戰慄開始，有腹部限局的疼痛和壓痛。該疼痛部肋骨弓領域的皮膚腫脹，有時胸廓下部或肋間腔擴張。膈膜的運動减少；所以肺下界呼吸時不移動。</p>
<p>問　急性限局性腹膜炎，診斷的時候，應當和那幾種疾病相區別？</p>
<p>答　應當行直腸或陰道檢査，和姙娠子宮充滿的膀胱或鼓腸相區別。又應當和膿胸，膿氣胸，肝膿瘍，胞蟲，腎周圍膿瘍等相區別。</p>
<p>問　急性限局性腹膜炎的治療方法，最好是怎樣？</p>
<p>答　最好早期行外科手術使排膿液。</p>
<p>問　怎樣看護病人？</p>
<p>答　使病人絕對安靜平臥。腹部用冰囊或溫　法。</p>
<p>問　內服用什麽藥品？</p>
<p>答　無非用止痛的藥品爲主。對於嘔吐用哥羅仿水，可卡因洗胃。吃逆時用阿託品注射。腸麻痺時，用Physostigmine，Eumydrinj　Atropin等水洗腸。</p>
<p>問　心力衰弱或虛脫時，用些什麽藥品？</p>
<p>答　用樟腦劑，咖啡因，卡地佐爾等的注射。或用生理食鹽水林格爾氏液，洛克氏液等再加千倍腎上腺素液（一公撮）行靜脈內注射。（完）</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>余編輯醫訟彙抄旣竣，乃徘徊於一室之中，俯而思，仰而索，終乃作而起曰：醫病之訟案，如此其多也，其背景如此其複雜也，夫去其果者必先弭其因，止其流者必先寒其源，將欲息刁風而寗醫業，吾黨之士對於紛至沓來之醫病糾紛，安可不洞知其因果，而思所以預防之道乎？請本此旨，一略陳之：</p>
<p>因者何，背景是也。醫訟之背景，不止一端也。約而分之，則有四焉：自律師之制度興，而人民始得享有法益上之權利，向之舞文弄法之官吏，遂不能恣其所爲而無所顧忌矣！雖然，法者治人之工具，而用法者則存乎其人，律師者操法律以爲業者也，賢明者固可以公正廉潔，以保障人權爲目的矣，而以營業之故，不惜出以煽動離間之手腕，以遂其私者亦未嘗絕無之，於是社會之訟案日多，而醫者遂首居其衝焉！此其一。張釋之曰：「廷尉持天下之平」，今之法院，古所謂廷尉也。夫民有不平，斯訴於法，判有不當，斯卽於寃，欲其無寃，其在於法官之審愼受理乎？今法官之於醫案，始則不問被控者是否爲正式醫師而輕於受理，旣則偏聽病家感情作用之訟辭而忽視醫學上之根據，判决之文旣難服人心，而上訴之舉遂牽連不絕，此其二，新聞家者操輿論之權威，足以轉移社會之視聽者也，今乃於醫案之發生，每操有聞必錄之態度，不待其是非之大明，而卽爲不實之記載，因此而减低醫界之令譽，與社會之同情，此其三。抑又聞之：「木必先腐而後虫生，國必自伐而後人伐」，送訟之原因，醫界內部之不團結亦其一也，夫合則力聚，分則勢散，故自有醫派，而醫界團結之力日微，權利之爭以起，甚且有因一時之意氣而假手於他人以傾軋異派之同道者，內部如是，其又奚言，此其四，綜此四端，可云背景，若其豫防訟案之道，消滅寃獄之方，則又有數焉，請進而言之：</p>
<p>夫醫學爲至專門之科學，病人之不治，死于醫抑死于病，非專家不能判也，法官雖熟于法律之條文，而不嫺於醫理，故受理之際，必須函請正式醫團作公正之鑑定，以爲判决時之根據，而同時又須施以尸體之剖騐，以求事實之天明，法官不得存一毫武斷之態度于其間也。雖然，鑒定矣！剖騐矣，而法官仍孤行其意，則如之何？此陪審之制度與寃獄之賠償所以必須實現也。夫有專家法醫之陪審，而後法官始不至越權，審問始皆中肯綮，有寃獄之賠償，而後病家始不敢輕於誣吿，法官始不敢任意判刑，鑑定也；剖騐也：陪審也：賠償也；四者逐步實現，其于醫病之糾紛或可消弭于萬一乎，至于團體方面則必須團結，而不可輕受人以可乘之機，個人方面則必須提防而不可稍涉疏忽，此則該本書之同道當自知之，而不待余之贅贅也。廿四年九月一日宋國賓跋</p>

<p>第三編　軟性下疳</p>
<p>軟性下疳之發生部位。主在陰部。如男子之冠狀溝，包皮內板或尖端，龜頭，陰莖緊帶，外尿道口，陰莖皮膚及陰囊。女子之後連合（陰門與肛門中間部），外尿道口，陰道入口，子宮外口及陰唇等部。</p>
<p>軟性下疳以發生部位之不同。而症狀亦稍異。今列舉如次：</p>
<p>A男子之在陰莖緊帶部者其繫帶時被爛斷。或爛其四傍，只勝橋形之繫帶。此種下疳。容易併發横痃。</p>
<p>B在包皮內板者則浮腫著明。膿汁易于瀦留。有如嵌頓包皮。此時龜頭每被損害。而致全部包皮及龜頭之壞死。</p>
<p>C初起卽在龜頭者症狀較輕。但亦有內侵陰莖海綿體而成壞疽而脫落者。</p>
<p>D在龜頭頸部者每沿龜頭作環狀蔓延。致外尿道口之潰爛者有之。</p>
<p>E在女子之陰唇及陰門者亦往往作繞匝的蔓延。</p>
<p>F在陰門之大前庭腺者初爲硬結。後成潰瘍。以火山口樣之外觀爲其特徵。</p>
<p>G在小陰唇與陰核者　浮腫著明。適如發於男子之包皮內板。</p>
<p>H在陰道內者以其爲多層扁平上皮之組織。故不易侵犯。如有之。必在下部或內方。</p>
<p>軟性下疳之經過。普通每自二三週至七八週而全愈。但遇下疳之陸續新生時。則經過綦長。</p>
<p>丙·診斷及豫後軟性下疳之診斷。依短促之潛伏期，特有之潰瘍狀態等可知之。至於鑑別診斷。則與黴毒之硬性下疳。已詳述於第一編中。與徽毒之陰部丘疹。依黴毒丘疹之不破潰，及陽性華氏血淸反應等可區別之。至與其他病症相鑑別。在洞悉各病之特有症狀及特有反應者。自如庖丁解牛而游刃有餘也。</p>
<p>軟性下疳之預後。一般佳良。但在蛇行性蔓延。及侵蝕性或壞疸性變化時。治瘉後殘留器質的缺損。或則發生敗血症或大出血血死者。亦有之。</p>

<p>（六十一）　淚囊膿瘍</p>
<p>淚囊膿瘍，又名急性淚囊炎。或名　　淚囊蜂窩織炎。起因多由慢性淚囊炎轉變而來。因爲在患慢性淚囊炎的時候。牠的粘膜。容易損傷。以致細菌易得侵入組織的機會。而發生膿瘍。此外梅毒性骨膜炎皮及腺病性骨膜炎。亦可誘發淚囊部的蜂窩織炎。本病的症侯。願爲顯明。當牠發病的起始。卽覺淚囊部的劇痛。皮膚發赤腫脹。劇烈的時候。並可發生結膜，眼臉，或顏面半部的浮腫。患者發熱。夜不安眠。如是經過兩三日。淚囊部的皮膚。轉爲黄色。於是自己破壞。排出多量的膿液。此時疼痛頓然停止。腫脹亦卽漸次消失。破壞的創口。常可變爲瘻孔。時時流出膿樣的液體。後則轉爲漿液樣。終則變爲水樣的液體。此時稱爲淚囊瘻。瘻管並不一定生在淚囊部。亦可生在牠的附近處。有時瘻管雖已閉鎖。而淚鼻管依舊仍未疏通。以致不免再發生狠多。有時瘻管終身存在。而由瘓孔常常流出漿液樣或水樣液的亦不少。</p>
<p>淚囊膿瘍的治療方針。第一，當然速治慢性淚囊炎。勿使誘發本病。第二，在皮膚未曾破壞的時候。應當設法排出淚囊所蓄積的液體。第三，如若疼痛劇烈而皮膚業已變爲黄色的時候。是卽已經化膿的明證。此時可在淚囊的前壁。施行切開。排出膿液。第四，設使淚囊瘻爲時已久。或者難於治愈。則須施用摘出法摘出淚囊。方爲上策。</p>

<p>— 李興</p>
<p>生產痛</p>
<p>婦人臨盆時是免不了要受些痛苦。生產痛是一種生理作用。平產約歷半日至一日半之久不等。第一次生產的疼痛較多些。至於爲什麽生產要痛，平常人多是不十分明白。痛的由來是子宮一陣一陣的收縮。胎兒的頭在產前比產道直徑大，所以必須有一陣一陣的收縮，才能將胎兒的頭擠小，使合於產道之大小。胎兒頭的幾道長骨節原來是活動的，由子宮一陣一陣的收縮，漸逼漸緊，頭之大塊骨於長骨節處便疊起，於是頭之直徑也减小了。產道不是一直道隨子宮收縮作用頭頸也曲折順產道而下行。頭必須達到一定的位置，否則爲難產。</p>
<p>這完全是一種生理作用，由子宮收縮（卽痛）胎兒頭縮小，再經產道頭達到一定位置，子宮頸口也漸隨之放大，直至各種作用都達到一定限度，胎兒頭被迫出產道，其次胎身隨出胎兒就完全生出。胎兒落地後的停數分鐘至二十餘分鐘一陣較平和性的痛又起，直到胎盤排出生產痛就告一段落。</p>
<p>難產不但是痛，並且有時還有性命危險。不甚嚴重的難產，產婦多受些痛苦，然後可以安然度過。至於絕對的難產，非施行特別手術，必定母子兩傷。</p>
<p>原始人類男女都過的是粗野生活，全身肌肉都充分發育健全有力。一遇生產肌肉收縮有力自如，於短時間之內生產就可完畢，並沒有特別痛苦。現在南美洲的紅印第安人，他們所過的仍是太古生活，這些婦女生產都很容易。就是我國鄕間種田的婦女生產，也不算得什麽特別事。生產較難痛苦較多的是現在過舒適生活的。他們的肌肉發育的很不健全，並且也不活動，所以生產不大容易。</p>

<p>三個月滿當者，靑島三十三家。六個月滿當者，廣州五十四家。八個月滿當者，廣州三家。（編者按：原表共計作六二家，未知孰是）一年滿當者，廣州一三九家，厦門五家，瀋陽五〇家，營口九家，安東一二家，成都二五家。共計二四〇家。十三個月滿當者靑島二家。十八個月滿當者上海四八家，南京八家，天津一三家，杭州一九家，寗波十家，瀋陽五家，安東二家，成都一二家，重慶九家，共計一二六家。（原文作一三〇家，未知孰誤，編者又按。）兩年爲滿者，北平一〇五家，天津一二家，廣州五家，厦門六家，濟南五家，共計一三三家。</p>
<p>江蘇等十六省典當業滿當期限統計表</p>
<p>據上表，除靑島典當滿當期限三個月，及遼寗四十日，爲日人所設者外。我國典當滿當期限，最短六個月，最長三年。而以十二個月，十三個月，十八個月，二十四個月爲最普遍。計上海等十五市調查之六百五十四家典當中，滿當期限之百分比如下表：</p>
<p>期限　家　占調查當總數　期限　家　占調查當總數</p>
<p>十二月二四〇　〇六·七％弱　廿四月一二三　二〇　％强</p>
<p>十八月一三〇　二〇　％弱　合　計五〇三　七六·七％强</p>
<p>又江蘇省等十六省所調查之一千二百八十一家典當中，滿當期限之百分比如下表。。</p>
<p>期限　家　占調查當總數　期限　家　占調查當總數</p>
<p>十二月三五五　二七·七％强　廿四月一〇二　八％弱</p>
<p>十三月二六九　三　％　合　計九六三　七五·二％强</p>
<p>十八月二三七　一八·五％强</p>
<p>其中可注意者：發即以十二個月爲滿當之家數，就此次調查所得，占最多數。省市合計共五九五家。如將十三個月添入，共計八百六十四家，占省市所調查典當總數（一千九百三十五家）百分之四。七弱，約及半數。十八個月爲滿之家數，省巿合計共三百六十七家，占省市所調查典當總數百分之一八·九强。廿四個月爲滿之家數，省市合計共二百三十五家，占省市所調查典當總數百分之一二强。</p>
<p>其次可注意者：即都市典當之滿期，常較農村典當爲短。蓋農民春季押欵，到秋收方有欵贖還。如本年秋季收獲不佳，延至次年秋季再贖。其回贖能力，受季節限制。都市典當之當戶，則多爲小工商業者或貧苦巿民，其收入並無季節關係，隨當隨贖。都市典當，與農村典當，在此一點上，性質根本不同。兩者滿當期限、自須依其性質，分別規定。就上舉調查：上海等十五市典當期限，以十二個月爲滿者，占調查家數百分之三六·七。農村典當滿當期限，以十二個月爲滿者，佔百分之二七·七。前者百分數顯然較後者爲髙。又都市滿當期限，最長二十四個月。而農村滿當期限，有長至三十六個月者。</p>
<p>各省典當業單行法規，對於滿當期限之規定，與上述實際情形，略有出入。茲摘錄民國二十三年，作者調查各省典業單行法規中關於滿當期限之規定，如下表：</p>
<p>地名　典當　押（或質）</p>
<p>江蘇　十一個月　（再保留　六個月）</p>
<p>上海　十八個月八個月</p>
<p>浙江　十八個月</p>
<p>安徽　十八個月</p>
<p>湖北武陽　六個月</p>
<p>湖南　十個月七個月</p>
<p>福建　二十個月</p>
<p>廣東　（當）三年（按）二年　一年下則六個月</p>
<p>雲南　六個月</p>
<p>昆明　十二個月</p>
<p>山東　十三個月</p>
<p>靑島　十三個月</p>
<p>陝西　二十偭月</p>
<p>熱河　十二個月十個月</p>
<p>貴州　（當）二十七個月　（典）十三個月　（質）十二個月　（押）十個月</p>
<p>山西六個月</p>
<p>廣西十二個月</p>
<p>河北十八個月</p>
<p>據上表，各省巿典業單行法規，對於滿當期間之規定，雖與實際情形，略有出入。但除小押外，大體均在十二個月以上，有長至三年者。此項滿當期間，是否適當，須視典當與當戶兩方之利害關係，及當物種類而定。茲先列舉各重要國家典當之滿當斯限，以資參證：</p>
<p>各主要國家營利典當之滿當期限表國名滿當期限</p>
<p>英國　一年零七日</p>
<p>美國　十二個月至十八個月（各州不同此係根據標準典業規則草案所擬者）</p>
<p>德國　半年至一年</p>
<p>日本　普通四個月至六個月各主要國家公益典當之滿當期限表</p>
<p>法國　普通一年</p>
<p>章國　六個月</p>
<p>比利時　一年</p>
<p>德國　普通半年至一年</p>
<p>奧國　一年</p>
<p>日本　四個月</p>
<p>美國伊利諾州　一年</p>
<p>根據上歹兩表，可知各國典當，無論私營公營，普通滿當期限，均爲一年：與我國情形，大致相彷也。</p>
<p>滿當期限之大致情形，旣如上述。以下討論我國之滿當期限，究以幾個月爲宜？茲就各方面，加以探討：</p>
<p>第一，從當戶方面着想</p>
<p>典當法規中之所以規定滿當之最短期限者，原爲保護當戶而設，與規定最高利率之用意相同。蓋當戶雖與典當在表面上立於對等地位，自由交易。但實際上當戶因需欵迫切，及經濟力量薄弱之故，與典當較，常處於不利地位。故國家立法，有保護弱者之必要。滿當期限過短，則贖取之機會减少，當戶之損失甚大。試以日本爲例：日本於明治三十九年時，東京巿滿當期限，普通爲八個月，滿貨當本與放欵總額之比例，爲百分之七。其後滿當期限，漸次縮短。此種比例率，亦逐漸增加。至大正二年，滿當期限，通常爲四個月至六個月，滿貨當本與放欵總額之比例，增至百分之十二。故日本公益典當法第八條規定：</p>
<p>『滿當期限，從質契約成立之日起，不得少於四個月。如有規定滿當期限，不滿四個月者，應改爲四個月。』</p>
<p>上舉條文，有强制性質。爲規定滿當期限，保護當戶利益之典型法規。但滿當期限過長，利息與時俱增，致當戶無力贖取，於當戶亦不利也。</p>
<p>第二，從典業方面着想</p>
<p>從典業方面觀之：滿當期限，以縮短較爲有利。蓋（甲）當物保存時間旣短，式樣尙未過時，脫售較易。（乙）於短期內，收回放欵，再供運用，資金周轉活潑。（丙）如當物係商品或農產物時，價格變動較少，不致受意外損失。但典當營業之目的？在徵取利息，而不在滿貨處分時之利得。况當此滿貨處分，極爲困難之時，典當更竭力設法减少滿貨。滿當期限過促，滿貨自多。故不僅於當戶爲不利，亦非典當之所願也。</p>
<p>第三·從歷史上演進觀察</p>
<p>商業行爲，因社會經濟關係，漸趨複雜，而日求敏捷。金融機關，爲商業之中心。故商業銀行放欵，均以短期爲主。我國典當，雖以供給消費資金及農村放欵爲主。然放疑期亦有逐漸縮短之勢。例如湖北典當，在淸限爲十六個月，至民國十六年，改爲十二個月，現在武陽，又縮短至六個月。又日本典當期限，在德川時代，爲十二個月。明治初年，爲八個月。現在則縮短爲四個月至六個月，演進之跡，歷然可觀。我國典當，一般人心理，以十八個月滿期居多數者，但據上述調査，則知十二個月滿期，已較十八個月更爲普遍矣。</p>
<p>總合上述各點，滿當期限過長，不僅於當戶及典業兩方，均感不利；且與現代之社會經濟關係，亦不一致。是從理論上言：十八個月以上之滿當期間，有縮短之必要。再就事實而論：各國多數，以十二個月爲滿期。我國各地，現行慣習，及各省市單行法規，亦以十二個月滿期者居最多數。故今後我國典當滿當期間，宜確定以十二個月爲標準，再視地方情形，（都市與農村不同）當物種類。（如農產品應視季節而定摩登女服變動太速期限應特行縮短）斟酌定之。</p>
<h3 id="c161">美國棉業計劃的失策（續） <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 增椿</p>
<p>各製造國生產的增加，除美國外，早由消費方面的數字，可以證明。下表所示，係世界棉紡織業聯合會所報吿的世界棉花消費數額。（單位千包絨花除外）：</p>
<p>世界棉花消費表</p>
<p>一月三十一日止之六個月數字</p>
<p>×德國不在內，因無該項報吿可資參考</p>
<p>據上表觀之，可知世界消費其他各種棉花，似有增加。而美棉的消費，在過去兩年實有减少。一九三五年一月三十一日止之六個月，若與過去一年同期比較，仍有同樣趨勢。即美國减少一·〇二八·〇〇〇包，而其他種棉則增加一·四四八·〇〇〇包的需要。現將近年來各國消費美棉的分配列表於後：</p>
<p>根據上表所示，可知美棉的種植者幾完全依賴着出口，在一九三一年與一九三四年之間，日本對於美棉的消費特增。這是由於日本對印棉消費由一·六九七·〇〇〇包减至一·二二四·〇〇〇包的緣故。不過美國方面觀之，則又爲日本生絲的最大主顧。</p>
<p>棉花雖爲紡織織維中的最重要者。但從歐戰以後，其消費量之增加實少於其他三項紡織織維。可從下表中知之。</p>
<p>一九二九—三二年</p>
<p>上列各項紡織織維中，當推人造絲一項，過去皆有急劇的進展。在過去一年，世界產量總數已達七九一百萬包。此種新興紡織織維的成功，一半由於品質的進步；一半由於大製造家，運用其奬勵政策，使顧客减輕成本所致。故其結果，人造絲已侵佔棉花，絲，及羊毛等原有的市塲了。因的棉價提髙，實間接造成人造絲奪取其地位而代之。此後棉價雖或因各國生產的增加而低落，但生產重行分配的過程，尙需相當時日。果眞如此，則美國是否願意喪失其重要的出口事業，這是一僩疑問。據吾人所知，美國政府雖與各國政府磋商一國際間的限制棉花生產計劃。但不論何國對於此種不自然的限制，皆不約而同的加以拒絕。月亟望有以分潤，美國减少生產後的餘利。所以今後美國如過祇用限制方法來提髙棉價，這是很少有成效的一種政策！（完）</p>

<h3 id="c172">閒適與頹廢 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>我們如果留心每朝每代的文藝的情形，便可以推測出國家的典亡來，這不是迷信，乃是實情，因爲文藝大抵是屬於民間的，無論是文章，無論是詩歌，以代表大衆的語言的居多數，所以看它的詩歌，看它的文章，便可以推測出國勢如何來。初唐的詩人的作品，沒有一個不是氣魄雄偉的。楊炯的詩：「雪暗凋旗畫，風多雜鼓聲，寗爲百夫長，勝作一書生。」駱賓王的詩：「滿月臨弓影，連星入劍端。不學燕丹客，空歌易水寒。」都大有憤發爲雄的氣慨。等到經過若干年之後，這種氣慨消磨凈盡了。剩下來的便是些閒情逸致，頹廢的享樂，和輕微的別恨離愁相思苦，人們彷彿都提不起精神來，都像是病剛好，軟綿綿的沒有氣力，這彷彿是時代逼迫着他們這樣作。這也不能怪這時代我們的文人不爭氣，是時代的環境使然，不僅現在，那朝代都是一樣。我們看晚宋時代的作品：</p>
<p>「華館相望接使星，長　南北已休兵，便須買酒催行樂，更覓何時是太平。」—宋吳則禮詩。</p>
<p>這種情形是否同現在一樣？人們所耽求的只是苟延殘喘的安逸，關在象牙之塔裏，滿看不見社會國家是怎樣的情形，不，也許是看得見的，但總有一種「管不了這許多」的心情，於是只可以暫時享樂。「滿船買了洞庭橘，雪色新裁白苧衫，喚得吳姬同一醉，春風相送到江南。」（吳則禮詩）這眞是公子哥兒的行徑。一般人是這樣享樂，一般人却又想離開人間，離開這世界，作一個逃世的隱士。「尋得桃源好避秦，桃紅又是一年春，花飛莫遣隨流水，怕有漁郎來問律。」那時代是可以逃避現實的，這時代是逃避不了的，如果我們這樣，只有等着惡魔張大了嘴將我吞嚙了。我們的閒適也沒有多少時候，這象牙之塔是沒有日子的居住了。我們張開眼睛看：</p>
<p>「草舍離宮轉夕暉，孤雲飄泊復何依—山河風景元無異，城郭人民半已非……」—（文天祥詩）</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>「愛情的大神在這時便突然下降，</p>
<p>他來時氣象的莊嚴，眞使我現在還不敢回想」。</p>
<p>——但丁新生</p>
<p>沿阿爾諾河邊上，我和比特麗斯（Beatrice）緩緩地一步一步走去，一同下了小船。她穿着橄欖色的樸素的紗衣，和樹林樸籬草原的彩色相調和；她的影子照在水波裏，彷彿天上倒映下來的明霞。她默默不語，她凝視着我，那無比的秀媚的眼睛。委琪爾，他回到林拔住所去了；比特麗斯伴着我渡向阿蘭諾河的對岸——地上的天堂。</p>
<p>在夾着的槐樹下，我彎着她一同走。知了在槐樹上嘶鳴着，顯得這境地格外幽靜，可以聽到我們倆的呼吸。</p>
<p>「她是神，她是大自然的主宰，她是知慧和美麗的大融和。」我想。</p>
<p>我彷彿看見她的周圍有無數無數的天使園繞着，唱着歌，散着花朶。假使我是塵土，我心廿意願地讓她踐踏。</p>
<p>「剛才回去的那個是誰？他和你從那兒來？他回到那裏去？」她問。</p>
<p>「他，委琪爾，詩人，也是哲學家。他說依着你的意旨，看顧着我的運命。我們周歷過地獄的階層，我們在地獄之門上看見「進到這裏來的，所有的希望都　絕了」的文句。現在，委琪爾，他回到那陰鬱的老地方去了。」</p>
<p>「一，我看見你總是一副　憂鬱的嘴臉，不也有值得浮　上微笑的時候？」</p>
<p>「B，微笑？我現在是浮上微笑了，在你的跟前。從前我相信黎明期總該不遠了，朝陽一出來，我們可以過愉樂的日子了。我現在知道目前正在漫漫的長夜，北極光偶或透了起來，而前仍是這麽漆黑，沒有一綫光明」</p>
<p>「在黑暗中走，也沒幾個同行的洶伴嗎？」</p>
<p>「記得當初同行的也有一羣人，大家都很年靑，相信自己在黑暗裏能够睜開眼看，相信找索摸索，總可以走出這黑暗的圈子的。沒有多久，　伴們有的逃回去了，有的在陷阱裏倒下去，永遠不看見了；還有的坐在那里等待天明。我是這樣孤獨，沒有淘伴，永遠在黑暗中摸索。」</p>
<p>我們兩人走到柳蔭下，我伴着她坐了下來。面前是小河，水面給微風吹拂着，皺起一層軟弱的波紋。頭上，這樹的知了和那樹的知了錯縱地奏出曼展的嘶聲。後面，革地上那長頸的白鵝踱了過來，偶或「拍着翼子大聲叫起來。我這時覺得以前什麽都是幻夢，惟有這大融和是眞實；但又覺目前這大融和是幻夢，眞實的必是那些可怕的悪夢。她彷彿也覺得似的，她問我：</p>
<p>「D，你在想些什麽？」</p>
<p>「要說想什麽呢？那該是眞想什麽了。從前我相信有黑和白，是和非這樣分明白的兩面的；我把環繞在我們圈子上的人，分做朋友和仇敝兩個不同的羣，把我所聽到的所看見的話，分做應該贊成或反對的兩種不同的判斷。我現在知道沒有那麼簡單，在利害的算盤上，朋友和仇敵，贊成或反對，瞬息萬變，簡直分不淸的。沒有一種現實値得我來留戀，我最後的留戀，是「愛」。』</p>
<p>比特麗斯微笑着聽他說下去，她不說什麽。</p>
<p>「從前我也曾熱心於政治；我的父親是哥爾夫派，我也就是哥爾夫派的人。後來我因爲滅亡的恐懼，我覺得我應當愛國家，乃變成了吉貝林派。當我還在童年，每天去上學沿途看見地上汪着鮮血的窪；這可怕的影子，永遠擾亂着我。再後來，我被逃出佛羅稜薩城，在雷文娜的廢址上，漂泊得很久很久。當靑年的狂熱已經消逝，也便從政治的　圍中退了出來。我想我的心，我的靈魂該有一個安放的去處，像白雲躱藏在巖谷裏一樣。</p>
<p>我說了「自雲躱藏在巖谷裏」，我的聲音有點發戰。這時，大風正在吠動，空中一團團的黑雲飛也似地送過來，雨點從頭上落下來了。兩脚是一陣按一陣地密集，隔河的樹林爲濃霧所罩沒，糢糊得不能辨認。我們倆憑着欄干看這空濛的雨景，濺飛的雨珠濕了她的頭髮：只見幾隻靑蠅在桌的周圍打旋，白　在革地上拍翼子。我覺得剛才那明朗的景色是一種調和，現在這迷濛的原野又是一種調和，就大自然看，彷佛沒有不是一種調和。而她的明朗的笑容即示大自然的啟示。</p>
<p>「白雲躱藏在巖谷裏嗎？你沒見白雲裊裊地飛出來？留戀着「愛」，本有明朗的晴雪，也有陰暗的霧雨，也有暴風而在昏夜狂吼。」</p>
<p>她緩緩地一字一字地吐了出來，一語一句，都有節奏。她的眼睛閃着光輝。</p>
<p>「雨後靑山，會更明秀呢！」我說。</p>
<p>天已經晴了，遠山，深林，原野，水波，譜出一曲凝和的新調。她在河邊走着，護容地，莊嚴地。</p>
<p>「她是神，她是大自然的主宰，她是知慧和奬麗的大調和！」</p>
<p>我這樣想着，重復和她一同走下小船。小船在河波上漾盪，白雲在巖谷裏得到牠的歸宿了！</p>
<h3 id="c174">長江輪上 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 萊紫</p>
<p>深夜，我睡得正濃的時候，母觀突然將我呌醒：</p>
<p>「漢生，你看！什麽東西在呌？……我剛剛從　後的女茅房裏回來……」</p>
<p>我拖着鞋子。茶房們死猪似的横七横八地倒在地上，打着沉濁的鼾聲；連守夜的一個都靠着艙門睡着了。別的乘客們也都睡了，祇有兩個還在抽鴉片，交談着一些令人聽不分明的，瑣細的話語。</p>
<p>江風呼嘯着。天上的繁星穿鎭着一片片地濃厚的烏雲。浪濤瘋在地打到甲板上，拚命似的，隨同泡沫的飛濺，發出一種沉銳的，創痛地呼號！母親畏縮着身子，走到艘後時，她指着女厠所的黑暗的角落說。。</p>
<p>「那一裏！就在那裏……那裏角落裏！有點什麽聲音的…」</p>
<p>「去呌一個茶房來？」我說。</p>
<p>「不！你去看看，不會有鬼的……是一個人也不一定…」</p>
<p>我靠着甲板的鐵欄杆，將頭伸過去：就有一陣斷續的，悽苦的鳴咽聲，從下方，從浪花的飛濺里，飄傳過來：</p>
<p>『啊喲……啊啊喲……』</p>
<p>「過去呀！你再過去一點聽聽看！」母親推着我的身子關心地說。</p>
<p>「是一個人，一個女人！」我斷然回答着，『她大概是用繩子吊在那裏的，那根横着的鐵棍子下面……』</p>
<p>一十五分鐘之後，我運着母親的命令，單獨的，秘密而且冒險地救起了那一個受難的女人。</p>
<p>她是一個大肚子，一個四十歲上下的鄉下婦人。她的兩腋和胸部都差不多給帶子吊腫了。當母親將她拉到女厠所門前的昏暗的燈光下，去盤問她的時候，她便　着一雙長着蘿葡花瘤子的小眼，惶懼地，幽幽地哭了起來。</p>
<p>「不要哭呢！蠢人！給茶房聽見了該死的……」母親安慰地，吿誡地說。</p>
<p>她開始了訴述她的身世，悲切而且簡單：因爲鄉下鬧災荒，她拖着大肚子，想同丈夫和孩子們從漢口再逃到蕪湖去，那里有她的什麽親戚。沒有船票，丈夫孩子們在開船時都給茶房趕上岸了，她偷偷地吊在那裏，因爲是夜晚，才不曾被人發覺……</p>
<p>朝我，母親悠長地嘆了一口氣說：</p>
<p>『兩條性命！幾乎……祇要帶子一斷……」回頭再對着她：「你暫時在這茅房裏藏一藏吧，天就要亮了。我們可以替你給賬房去說說好話，也許能把你帶到蕪湖的……」</p>
<p>我們仍舊回到艙中去睡了。母親好久還在嘆氣呢！……但是，天剛剛一發白，茶房們就哇啦哇啦地閙了起來！</p>
<p>『漢生！你來！他們要將她打死哩……」母親急急地跥着脚，扯着我的耳朶。她不知道在什麽時候爬起來了。</p>
<p>『誰呀！』我睡意朦朧，含糊地說。</p>
<p>『那個大肚子女人！昨晚救起來的那個！……茶房在打哩！……』</p>
<p>我們急急地趕到艘後，那裏巴經給一大羣早起的客人圍住着。一個架着眼鏡披睡衣的瘦削的賬房先生站在中央，安閒地咬着烟捲，指揮着茶房們的拷問。大肚于女人彎着腰，戰慄地縮成一團，從散披着的頭髪間晶晶地盈出血液。旁覜者的搭客，大抵都像看着把戯似的，覺得頗爲開心；祗有很少數表不了「愛莫能助」似的同情，在搖頭，吁氣！</p>
<p>我們擠到人叢中了，母親牢牢地跟在我的後面。一個拿着棍子的歪眼的茶房，向我們裝出了不耐煩的臉相。別的一個，麻臉的，兇惡的傢伙，睜着狗一般的黄眼請，請示似的，向賬房先生看了一眼，便衝到大肚子的戰慄的身子旁邊，狠狠地一脚——</p>

<p>當他着手弄亁净他的洋皮外套的時候，普洛霍爾對他說：「你要外套做什麼？這是夏天。</p>
<p>沙瓦卡轉過身來回答說：」做什麻？爲了不使父親冷。』</p>
<p>他周密的查看着這小船，把他的衰弱的蒼白的，年老的父親安置在船梢上，準備出發了。</p>
<p>「在六月裏回來，孩子，」他的哥哥說。「你帶去的東西那時候要用的。」</p>
<p>「什麼能够阻止我呢？」沙瓦卡回答，他在他的手上吐了口口沫，馬上握住了槳。他的牙床緊咬着，當他划着船向黄色的，骯髒的河流出發的時候。</p>
<p>他們還沒有走多遠的時候，沙瓦卡便問他的父親他的名字—考爾特是從什麽地方來的。他從前是從沒有問過這個的。</p>
<p>他的父親回答說，「大概是從你的祖父來的。」</p>
<p>「那麽他是從什麽地方得來的呢？」沙瓦卡又問。</p>
<p>父親望望他，又望望周圍的河水，蹙着眉說，「他大概是從他的祖父得來的。」</p>
<p>他們冉沒有說下去了。</p>
<p>在他們的旅行的第十二天，他們剛到這市鎭的醫院裏，父親就死了。沙瓦卡把他埋在市鎭的墓地裏。他得到了關於他的父親的死的證書，把牠儘深地藏在衣服裏面，於是出發，却不回到斯拍司克的家去，　是順着這河流一直向前走。</p>
<p>他早就打定了這個主意。要是他的父親到醫院還活着，被交給了醫生的話，他還是會一亳不差的這樣做的。</p>
<p>在他離開市鎮的時候，他難受極了，並不是想到了他的死了的父親，而是想到了那敎員亞路沙。「好的，你這女孩子。你有着一個紅的頭，但是你郤有一顆黑的心。」</p>
<p>整個夏天沙瓦卡離開了斯拍司克，雛別了那　　子的女孩，她傷害了他，正象訓鹿塲害了他的父親一樣　儘遠儘遠的旅行着。在巿鎭裏，他用賣出他父親的衣服得來的錢買了些長期旅行所最必需的東西。其中有滑雪鞋，碎鐵，舊的釘子和笨　的魚網。他儘可能的遠離開大的市鎭。他有時候也打打獵，但是他大部份是靠打魚過活的，因爲他嬰節省他的火藥和子彈。</p>

<p>— 浪</p>
<p>今歲我國水災之慘，區域之廣，人民生命財產損失之重且大，幾至難以數字計算，故此次水災，非但較民念爲甚，實是近數十年來所未有的慘象，然而我國社會外受外貨的傾銷，內受農村的破產，巿况蕭條，工業不振，經濟枯竭，救災能力，幾等於零，於是不得不用「娛樂不忘救災」的名詞，以資號召，這原是「哭裏帶笑」的一件大幸的勾當。</p>
<p>若照情理而論，這樣水災的嚴重，饑民的慘呼，凡我同胞，未羅此禍者，自應各發天良，解囊濟急，本來再用不着這麽游藝花選等種種名義，大吹大擂，以相號召，夫至救災義舉，不得已而用這種名目來號召，則一般觀衆的心目中，亦祇有娛樂而不知災民，就這種義舉以觀，非但已可推測我國人同情心之薄弱，實是人類道德全部的淪亡。</p>
<p>游藝助振，原是一種「醫得眼前瘡割却心頭肉的不幸舉動，亦是利用我國同胞心理的弱點，以成此舉，故徐來之當得起，和當不起「東方標準美人」的頭銜，我因不値得來加以討論，藉曰能也，則選舉已畢，已算了事，再用不着所謂加冠封號等荒謬行爲，踵事增華，互相標榜，不但滑天下之大稽，實是汚辱當世女士之人格，宜我國婦女協進會嘖有繁言也。</p>
<p>提倡奢侈，鼓勵澆風，原爲社會的惡德，况當此提倡新生活運動之時，社會經濟江河日下之日，此種舉動，原與現代生活潮流相反，卽以救災義舉一事言之，會中少一文開支，卽災民多一文救濟，會中多一文銷耗，卽饑民少一文補救，假定謂不如此荒誕滑稽，則不足以吸引許多的觀衆，要知此種行爲，因不能說絕對不能吸引一般毫無智識的觀衆，但因此事而所受種種銷費的代價，亦屬不貲，恐所得亦不償所失。</p>
<p>故此種滑稽的行爲，若深刻言之，是幸災樂禍的心理，卽以事實言之，亦是利用時機以博個人的虛譽，總之此次水災游藝，原以救濟災民爲目的，倘目的果然能達，公私兼濟，原是消極的救濟辦法，倘若有名無實，名爲救災，而饑民之所得無幾，徒多此無謂的舉動，則不能不深爲浩歎耳。</p>

<p>— 家人</p>
<p>一·流浪者的感情</p>
<p>一家立在秋風裏，九月衣裳未剪裁。</p>
<p>黄昏無事，站到窗前靜靜地凝視着在逐漸爲暮靄所籠罩的天色，而當迎面吹來一陣含有嫩凉之意的夜風，自己便不禁若有所戚的默默地唸起了薄命詩人黄仲則的兩句爲我最忘不掉的詩句。於是我的心境隨卽便陷入一種悵惘的狀態中。我的彷彿已冰結的情感因此漾着微微的波紋。我的思想開始作着寂寞的悲愁的旅行。誰也不相信時間是這樣飛快的，記着那年的秋天離家，想起來好像才正是昨天的光景一樣鮮明似的，可是數一數，逢到如今竞是第四個秋天了。這其時，我跨越過一些洋海，又跨越過一些城鎭，以及一些村落，數年的長長的日子都是十分忽忙地，從沒在任何地方逗遛過較久的時間，如同一個很勞碌的人，究竟爲了什麼，也許眞是存爲了什麼，不然我自己何以要這樣不停地把身心推磨着。然而我並不知道。我只知道走過的路的確不少，看過的事也的確不少，到於今却不曾獲得一件實實在在的東西。而祇是賺來了無邊的空虛和無邊的渺茫的感覺。至於長途跋涉的結果，則使我成爲一個極度倦厭於生的無謂的疲勞者。並且成爲一個無希冀，無歡情，甚至於無情感的變動的孤靈似的流落者了。</p>
<p>庸俗的生活粗糙之綱會把你的情感弄成鉛塊般的。我以爲人總是可憐的，老是那麽渾渾噩噩的從一個季候度到另一個季候，一年又一年地，而每個季候對於我大概總是支付着一種精神上的重感，和現實上的憂患和壓迫，流浪者原是沒有會有一天安定的日子的：熱煞人的夏天，似乎容易打發；一到夏去秋來，飄雪花的冬日也緊追在後頭，而冬季的衣物關在石庫門內，平常日子尙難應付，憑什麽餘裕去取出來呢，想着是會打寒噤的。但是現在我已全無此種掛慮，當不能解决的問題超過一傷腦弱的情感的力量以上的時候。</p>
<p>二·深夜的沈醉</p>
<p>以一個年輕人的心，而填滿着非年輕人所應有的灰色思想，更也或許還羼老年人的闌珊的氣息。於是我有了未老先衰的模樣，在人面前，我亦如一般人同樣的有說笑，有尋求娛樂的興緻。可是這些原非我所願意做的事，世間一切於我全是隔膜的，孤獨的，這隔膜這孤獨，同時也是我慣習的了。我心底藏住着許多的話，但是沒一個人可以讓我吐露給他聽，也沒有一個有資格値得我合他說，因是我喜歡於遼遠的思索與冥想了。每於深夜時分，打酒店裏喝得醉醺醺地拐出來，在冷寂的人行道上行着，行路者是隔上半天方瞧到一半個，這倒無礙於我縱情的行爲，我儘管張開嗓子，唱着吹口哨，如果天上有月，月便是我唯一的伴侶了。那就踐着月光，緩緩地走着，曲子唱的越有勁。要是不累，也無妨走到天明，因爲我的一腔怨懣已經無形消失了，臨着悲哀到沒法排遣，我就非沉在這樣的境地不可，雖然淸醒之後，必有一陣更難捱的苦楚，我明瞭，而暫時的陶醉終是愉快了一下的。在那時候，幾乎是一半在做萝：身子、浸在暈化了的銀液似的月色中，頭頂亮着星星，心情是興奮的，好像世間再沒有叫人悒鬱的事，而忘懷了一切，雖然偶然有幾片落葉給風吹墮，從我的前邊游過去，報吿我一點秋訊，但是我是未暇去留意了。</p>

<p>— 容</p>
<p>我的尾內有個小小的圓几，几上放了盤子，盤子內滿裝着新鮮的水菓—那甘美的菜，愛嬌的菓，引起人懷戀的菓。</p>
<p>靜下來的時侯，常對着這瑪瑙色的菓盤凝思，這菜盤是我們古老家庭中的遺物，牠曾經見過這家庭中的變革—喜與樂，觀與怨，興旺與衰頹—可是牠始終是縅默着。每當菓子上巿的時候，便會由不同的手把不同的菓子壓在牠的身上。現在被放在這屋角，一有菓子，便會散佈出馥郁的花木樣的香氣。聞到這香氣的人，便也恍如處身於一個芳草鮮美落英繽紛的菓樹園裏，終古凝定的靑天呈露出宇宙的平和，豐美的菓實配和着人們的喜悅，不由得不對這境界迷戀起來。幻想中可以有樹林，池水菜實搖曳在淡紅的晚霞影裏，或滾落在靑草坪上，像秋天的黄葉一樣。無依的鳥雀，來啄食那半靑的菜皮。啣到天半時，落了下來，沉到潭裏驚動了來往的游魚……可是一睜開眼，依然是這不大的屋子，一堆菓子靜靜地伏在那一裏，好像在竊笑你的痴氣。黄昏的薄明中，彷彿透過那麽一種語調：「你爲什麼不來吃我們呢？我們來接個吻好嗎？」聲音就如同一個妙齡的女郎，不由得你不回過頭去，當頭回過去的時候，什麽都沒有，依然是那堆菓子一動不動地伏在那裏，上了年紀的菓盤，被壓得喘不過氣，僵板地如一個負重的老女人。</p>
<p>有黄的香蕉，有深黄淺紅的花旗橘子，有紫色的或白色的半熟的葡萄，有十七歲少女那樣豐潤的蘋菓，有溢着香氣的蕩婦似的桃，這些都雜亂地你推着我我擠着你地伏在盤內，那種新鮮的，富有生命的氣象正和古老的，無力的菓盤凑成個顯明的對照。這一堆，看起來有時比瓶花還要好看，晨曦的拂照中，夜靜時綠色　燈的掩映中，就有那麽一種詩意的膝朧的情調，我有時甚至想提起筆來寫一首詩。</p>
<p>爲了滿足自己賞玩的趣味，總不忍去吃牠，我覺得把這些愛嬌的菜品吃進肚去，破壞了當前的點綴來滿足自己口腹的嗜欲，完全是件煞風景的事。有時手已經伸出去了，又在轉念中悄悄地抽了回來，有一次盤裏的菓全壞了，我帶着矜惜的心情把牠擲去，又換上一盤小巧玲瓏的海棠菓。全是紅的，是櫻桃的姊姊，蘋菜的妹妹，纖小而枯冷的綠葉子，又正如溫馨的髮，股勤地護若那羞澀的面龐。有一次我的食指動了，殘忍地嚙着她紅暈的雙頰而把那生命的甘芳咽到肚裏。那滋味很酸，是一種愛的味，酒的味，而帶着點回憶之戚傷的。</p>
<p>現在盤裏的海棠快被我食盡了，我希望明天上市去，能買到些更可愛的菓品，我是不能讓那盤子空着的。想到這裏，我面前又浮現出那麽絢爛的色彩，溫靜的或潑刺的顏色堆滿了我的周遭，很希望自己離開那每天要去的市塲，而跑到郊外的菜樹園去，坐在大樹下看書或抽烟，聽水池的魚躍，順手攀折下略帶靑色的菓實，一面吃着，一面跑過山岡去看碎瓷樣的田野，看黄昏時紅大的蜜柑形的太陽……</p>

<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>和普通小市鎭上的客寓一樣，他們卽以「招商客寓」作招牌的。但是那末多的商客被招來之後，那個禿頂的掌櫃，和患着失眠症似的伙計有些招架不過來了。</p>
<p>十來張木桌都坐滿了人，地上隨處都是被帶進來的水漿，小伙計本來有些跌東撞西，這一來，脚下更是閙蹩扭了。他先每一張桌上授了一只木盆及幾條手巾，一邊依次詢問主顧們要吃些什麽菜。這時候，，掌櫃的郤來打招呼了，他已是滿頭淋若汗珠，彷彿剛從竈下爬出來似的。有些在六鳥灣打過宿的主顧，要掌櫃先打些好酒出來，於是掌櫃的拉開了破毛竹的喉嚨：「遠年花雕裏屋有這末十來罎多着，上號白米有幾十祖堆着，可是…」掌櫃把眼晴瞇了起來，仰天打了個哈哈，那種市儈的氣派是做得十足的，接着用眼風向雜閙的這一羣打了個轉，說：「眞是對不起得很，新鮮的小菜是沒有地方買了，客官們，帮俺這個，馬馬虎虎。」</p>
<p>他自家又笑了起來，自然更引笑了我們這一羣。</p>
<p>一餐飯，不相識的人都熟識了。大家裝飽肚子，就想到身上被雨水打濕了的衣衫，招商客寓很有些像北派，大家一聲呼喊，那患着失眠症似的小伙計早已在禿頂掌櫃的指揮之下為我們置備了炭盆。這時大家徘紅的臉上溢着微微的酒意，一股勁都剝下濕淋淋的衣服，彷彿是在」個大雪紛飛的冬天的夜裏，團團圍着火盆，把衣服敞開了，看着被火燄蒸發着的水蒸氣飛升。暫時，大家沉入了甜蜜的回憶中，讓時間飛快地過去</p>
<p>屋外的大雨還是像雷聲一樣打在屋頂上，我知道每個人都是分明聽到的：可是在這種近乎天方夜譚的情况下，沒有人願意想到被天雨所阻止的苦痛或損失引起這一羣的不快，而更打破了大家靜靜享受着的快感。掌櫃與小伙計不知什麽時候藏到竈下去了，來到那個冒着蒸氣的禿頂重現到我們眼前來的時候。他的市儈式的笑聲像一支利箭一樣在廣穆的飯廳中激發起來。</p>
<p>「客官們，要用一點釅茶嗎？」談着把身子一讓，他的巨大的猪身背後小伙計早雙手捧着一個大盤，十來杯幾乎是黑色的釅茶和那個禿頂同樣冒着熱氣。「外面雨大得很。明天恐怕還是不能開船的呵！」接着自然又是一連串使人皺眉的笑聲。</p>
<p>被他這樣一說，那巨大的雨聲彷彿更明晣送進每個人的耳官，但是你想對掌櫃的發脾氣嗎？他是像一只狡滑的狐狸，把腦袋一伸一縮，而且那樣殷勤地把一杯杯的茶送到每個客人面前。一個商人無論如何是不會忘了他的做生意哲學的。</p>

<p>「時勢英雄」戲提前開拍</p>
<p>胡萍早些日子病了些時候，那豐满蘋果色的面龐雖消瘦了一點，然而美　並沒减去絲毫。</p>
<p>據胡萍自巳說：「我這次病的起源，不外是工作過度，因為一方面在藝華拍應雲衛導演的「時勢英雄，」一方面又要到新華拍「桃花扇」，有時候日夜都拍戲，精神上沒有充分的修養，以致病了。」的確在這大熱天拍戲，是够辛苦的。</p>
<p>胡萍是湖南人，她離別了家鄕，離別了親愛的父母，未到這千里迢迢的上海，做着一員中國電影文化的戰士，巳是三年多了，這三年多中，胡萍終想返故鄉一次，看一看淸愛的父母，然而她的理想終不能實現。</p>
<p>最近，她的父親不憚旅途跋踄的來到上海看她，一別三年多的父女相見時，你想：這是多麼動人有悲有喜的一副畫面呀！</p>
<p>她的父親吿訴她，她的母親現在老病復發，勢極危險，終日只懷念她，胡萍聽了母親這樣的近况，那一顆芳心早經粉碎，淚兒不自禁的滴落下來。</p>
<p>現在，胡萍巳决定向藝華公司請假一月，返湘探望母親，行期大約在這二星期中，至於她在「時勢英雄」未完成的戲，已商得導演應雲衛的同意，提前開拍。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Copper North Dikes Completed, Western Flooding Recedes, Eastern Waters Rise, Longhai Railway Establishes Labor Service Corps, Both Banks of the Buluo River Become a Marsh <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Longhai Railway has established a labor service corps to assist in building the Jinpu transverse dike to prevent Yellow River flooding. Wu Shi'en and Zhao Xuehai, the chiefs of the industrial police, led workers from Zhengzhou to Xuzhou. Together with Wei Yaotang, the director of the Xuzhou office, they supervised the workers and went north this morning to build a dike at Wanggongyu. The Copper North dikes have been completed. Returning from the front lines to Xuzhou, they reported that the flood affected over twenty villages in districts 21569, with 200,000 to 300,000 victims. The exact losses are still being tallied. It is hoped that relief efforts will be expedited. This afternoon, the western flooding in Copper North has receded, but the eastern downstream waters have risen. The Jingshan Bridge is submerged, and the water flow is extremely strong, approaching the water level of fifteen years ago. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water level at Maocun, Hanzhuang, and Shagou on the Jinpu Railway is level with the roadbed. The railway is transporting large quantities of stone slabs northward to stack them around the platforms and along the roadbed to prevent water from damaging the tracks and protect traffic. Wu Yiming, the director of the railway's engineering department, arrived in Xuzhou this morning and went north with Zhu Xianyang, the resident engineer in Xuzhou, to inspect the situation and plan flood defenses to avoid disrupting traffic. It is reported that the water at Maocun is from the Jing River overflowing, spreading widely. It can be seen from the Zifang Mountain in Xuzhou that the entire area is a vast expanse of white, with marshes on both sides of the Jinpu Railway. The river channel at Hanzhuang is overflowing from the Grand Canal, and the water is even higher than at Maocun. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Colleagues at the Ganghai Railway, aware of the severity of the disaster in Xuzhou, have formed a labor service corps with a spirit of solidarity. It is composed of employees from the locomotive, industrial police, and other departments. Zhao Zhongyun, the chief of the police section, has been appointed as the general leader, and Wu Shi'en, the director of the engineering department, has come to Xuzhou to provide guidance. They departed on the morning of the 25th to construct two dikes at Pipa Mountain Chedaokou. Furthermore, the Jin-Longhai Railway bureaus consider Xuzhou to be a crucial point for the Yellow River's diversion and the dikes to be extremely important. Therefore, the Longhai Railway is providing thousands of cubic feet of stone to build the dikes and, if necessary, can allocate trains to transport materials or borrow light rails for construction. (25th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Within the Huai-Pi section, the waterways entering the sea are the Six Ponds, the Salt River, and the abandoned Yellow River. The waterway entering the Yangtze River is the Inner Canal. Currently, except for the abandoned Yellow River, where a dam has been built for guiding the Huai River, the river affairs authorities will prioritize discharging the Yellow River water entering the country through the Yangtang Salt River to avoid affecting the Inner Canal and the Yangtze River. Furthermore, the second phase of the Huai River diversion project can only continue after the Yellow River is stabilized. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Within the Huaiyin area, the rivers are affected by the Yellow River water and showers. The Six Ponds are level with the slots, the Salt River is two feet from the banks, and the Inner Canal is four feet. However, the rivers are still rising. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to the Canal Flood Control Office, on the afternoon of the 25th, Weishan Lake rose by 7 centimeters, with a water level of 36.417 meters. Yao... rose by .11 centimeters, with a water level of 20.44 meters. Suqian rose by 45 centimeters, with a water level of 18.88 meters. Qingjiang rose by 5 inches. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The newly built Tai-Zhao branch line on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway crosses the Buluo River. The river water has risen, and it is only three inches from the bridge surface. The water in the Taierzhuang Canal is also only eight inches from the bridge surface. The situation on the branch line is tense. The water level at the Yunhe Bridge on the eastern section is also rising rapidly, but traffic is still safe. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Kong Xiangrong reported that the Jiangsuba scouring (a part of the dikes) was fiercely attacked and the situation was dangerous, and on the 25th he wired Zhang Lianjia to quickly mobilize workers from the Pinggong site to rush to its defense. In addition, one thousand cubic feet of stone stored in Lanfeng were allocated to form the dam foundation. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Kai, the chief engineer of the Huai River Diversion Committee, dispatched people to inspect the Lianjiaba area some days ago. After returning to Nanjing, he reported the situation to Chairman Su Chen Guofu. Xu said that the southern boundary of the Yellow River water is surging again. If it continues to rise, the Central Canal will inevitably be flooded. He will go to Shaobo, Huaiyin, Suqian, and other places to inspect the Huai River diversion project and the dike works of the Central Canal's Six Ponds. He will return to Nanjing in about a week. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Yellow River water in Weishan Lake is rushing towards the southeast bank, and the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. The south bank of the Buluo River has flooded, causing a disaster. This reporter went to Pipa Mountain on the morning of the 25th and patrolled downstream along the south bank of the Buluo River. This is the second line of defense for Xuzhou. Then, they went to Jinpu Road and took a trolley to Maocun Liguo Post. Each station was surrounded by flood waters. White waves were crashing on both sides of the roadbed, with boundless oceans and approximately 250 telephone poles and electrical poles of the Ministry of Communications were submerged in the water. The autumn crops were all submerged, with only the treetops visible. The Buluo River has lost its shape. The water level at the two large bridges, Maocun North and South, was five feet and six inches below the road, while the water surface was eight feet from the track. Both sides of the roadbed were eroded by water, and the culverts were insufficient to discharge the water. The engineering section is transporting large quantities of rubble to fill the roadbed. Zhu Xianyong, the chief of the engineering section, personally directed the work every day. Then, they returned to Dushan and looked into the distance. The water was vast in the northwest, southeast and entire region and had become a marsh. The villages along both banks of the Buluo River that were flooded included Lanshan, Lishan, Dazhuang, Meizhuang, Caiqiu, Li Wafang, Daxiaozhangjia, Maocunkou, Shangzhouzhai, Xiaochangguanshan, Qianhou Wangjia, Dayou Renzhuang, Zhangtai, Juxinzhuang, Li Zhuang, and Zhao Daozhe. Some people were reluctant to leave their properties, staying in their houses to await rescue. When this reporter arrived at Dushan, the disaster victims gathered by the roadside, prostrating themselves and crying for help. The chickens and dogs were wailing, and the miserable scene was heartbreaking. Then, they returned east along the roadbed of Pipa Mountain and passed the Longhai Railway labor service corps, which was preparing to build dikes with sweat. Wu Shi'en, the director of the engineering department, and Zhao Zhongyun, the chief of the police section, were directing the work. Continuing along the south bank of the Buluo River to Jingshan Bridge, the water flow was rapid, like ten thousand horses galloping. The waves were surging. The Zhushang people, ten watching the water, and the fishermen, were nearly congested by the three-mile Zhong Bridge. Thousands of people from districts six and seven in Henan were building dikes to block the breaches, but the situation remained precarious. According to the fishermen, the water level was rising rapidly, increasing by more than one foot in twenty hours. The northern section of Jing Bridge was gradually being submerged. Wang Gongyu personally supervised the work. This reporter returned to the city in the evening. (25th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) This morning, the heads of the Civil Affairs and Education Departments went to Qufu. At noon, Han's special car went to the counties along the Jinpu Line to inspect the condition of accepting refugees and went to Teng County to inspect the Grand Canal. On the 26th, they will go to Qufu to worship Confucius. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han inspected the refugee shelters in Taian and Ziyang today. Luo Dengsong, the magistrate of Ziyang County, was dismissed for poor management of the shelters to serve as a warning to those who are not effective in disaster relief. He will stay in Zi tonight and is scheduled to inspect the refugees in Zou County and Teng County on the 26th, as well as inspect the water conditions in Hanzhuang. Afterwards, he will return to Zi and depart for Qufu at 7:00 am on the 27th to worship Confucius before returning to Ji. (25th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance previously approved the Disaster Relief Committee's request to issue 50 million in disaster relief bonds this year to fund agricultural and industrial relief efforts due to the severe river disasters. It ordered its departments to study the issuance methods and properly plan a guarantee fund. It is now reported that the draft principles for the issuance of these bonds have been prepared and will be submitted to the Central Political Committee for approval before being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. The issuance quota may be adjusted up or down from the original request due to the fund and bond market situation. (25th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The main culprit in the assassination of Liu Zuozhou was apprehended on the 22nd by the Luan County Public Security Bureau in Baigezhuang, inside a fishing... His name is Li Zhenhua, a person from outside the customs, 25 years old. His foot was wounded by the bomb and had not healed. On the night of the 23rd, Li Fengyun, the commander of the 3rd security unit, sent Liu Lesan, the commander of the cavalry battalion, to lead a team of 100 men to take him away and detain him at the Luan County headquarters. Li Fengyun interrogated him. Li confessed to the assassination of Liu Zuozhou. He was originally scheduled to be sent to the Tangshan Commissioner's Office for interrogation on the 24th, but because Gu Rugeng went to Ping, the matter will be resolved after Yin returns before he is sent to Tangshan for interrogation. Of the 138 suspects in the Liu assassination case who were detained at the Luan County Security 3rd Unit, more than ten with lighter circumstances were released on bail on the 24th because the main culprit had been apprehended. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng rushed to Tianjin from Ping on the afternoon of the 25th because the main culprit in the Liu assassination case had been apprehended. He immediately visited Sakai, the chief of staff of the Japanese garrison, and Ishii, a senior staff officer, to explain the arrest. He planned to return to Tangshan by night train to interrogate the suspect. Li Zhenhua, the main culprit in the Liu assassination case, confessed at the Luan County Security Team headquarters that he was 25 years old, from Jin County, and formerly served as a company commander in the National Salvation Army. He was friends with Commander Wang Tiexiang. After Wang left, the National Salvation Army was reorganized into the First Security Brigade of the war zone, with Liu Zuozhou as the commander. He was then dismissed, leading to a feud. He specially purchased a gun and a bomb. Three days ago, he learned that Liu was going to Tangshan and disguised himself as a rural vendor, ambushing at the Aoxian station. When the car arrived at the station and opened, Liu got out of the car, with six guards following him, making it inconvenient to act. As he walked past the platform, a Japanese officer greeted Liu warmly, so he took the opportunity to fire. He shot Liu in the left chest. Hearing the commotion, the guards prepared to lie down and return fire. Liu cursed and shouted, "Give it to me!" Li took the opportunity to fire a second time, hitting Liu in the abdomen. The Japanese soldiers at the station prepared to return fire, so he fired a shot at them. Liu and the Japanese soldiers fell to the ground. Li fired a second time, hitting Liu in the right chest. Reporting that this had been achieved, he then threw a bomb, and in the ensuing smoke and confusion, he escaped. Due to the tight dragnet, he hid in Baigezhuang. (25th dispatch)</p>

When he fled to a hiding place somewhere in Luan County, he left traces of blood along the way. The police were able to obtain clues and track him down, eventually capturing him. Therefore, Tao went to Tangshan to interrogate the murderer Li Zhenhua. (25th dispatch)</p>

Once collection begins, all collection procedures will be handled by the other tax collection agencies under the ministry. The draft estate tax has now been completed but has not yet been sent out.

It is tentatively set to be levied starting from 5,000 yuan, with tax rates ranging from one per mille to twenty per mille. In addition, as of now, more than 670 counties and cities have submitted their budgets in accordance with central government orders. Based on a calculation of over 1,800 counties nationwide, this represents more than one-third.

After review and approval by the ministry, the scope will be indicated, and no other items may be included in the budget thereafter. This time, at least two-thirds can be accomplished.

<h3 id="e32">America's Silver Policy Wavering on the Crossroads <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>The U.S. government's silver purchasing policy, since the agreement concluded with China, India, Canada, and others in 1933, has, to this day, caused the New York silver price per ounce to rise from over 30 cents to over 70 cents, and the London silver price per standard ounce to rise from around 18 pence to over 30 pence. During this period, countries using silver, such as China and Mexico, have all suffered from the outflow of silver reserves and monetary contraction. Other countries, such as England, Japan, France, and the Netherlands, have also felt the pain of fluctuating exchange rates. The impact of the silver policy on the world economy can be said to be deep and intense.</p>
<p>Recently, overseas dispatches have reported that Thomas, the new leader of the American silver faction, has vehemently criticized the government's silver purchasing policy, saying that the government's purpose is only to buy silver at the lowest possible price, not to use silver as a genuine currency. He also denounced Pittman, the well-known leader of the silver faction, saying that he is not a spokesman for the silver faction. The U.S. Senate has decided to send committee members such as Thomas to Europe, Asia, and South America after the congressional adjournment to investigate the silver situation, in preparation for efforts to establish new silver legislation when Congress reconvenes in January next year. At the same time, Pittman has also proposed the organization of a five-person committee to investigate the impact of the silver policy on the domestic and international situation in conjunction with the Secretary of the Treasury. These two committees are pursuing their own agendas and clearly have opposing positions, which shows the depth and intensity of the contradictions within the American silver faction. The attitude of the U.S. Treasury Department towards the implementation of the silver purchasing bill has recently been quite different from the beginning, which is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>The biggest goal of the silver purchasing bill was originally to create a system of bimetallism in the United States, that is, to make the hard currency reserves for U.S. banknote issuance reach a ratio of three parts gold to one part silver. Although the provisions in the bill at the time were permissive rather than mandatory, the principle had undoubtedly been established. When the bill was established, the New York silver market was still hovering between 40 and 50 cents, and the domestic silver price was still 64.5 cents. Later, silver faction figures made extensive contacts, hoping to raise the price of silver to $1.29, and even wanted to reach a ratio of gold to silver of sixteen to one, that is, to set the price of silver at $2.08 (according to the fact that since the devaluation of the U.S. dollar in 1933, the price of gold has been $35 per ounce, so the price of silver must reach this figure to match the sixteen to one ratio). However, the U.S. Treasury Department ultimately raised the domestic silver price repeatedly to 77.57 cents. Although it is still far from the limit advocated by the silver faction figures, its implementation of the silver purchasing bill cannot be said to lack considerable sincerity. However, since the past two or three months, the Treasury Department's activities in the world silver market have clearly been less active than before, and the organization of Pittman's investigation committee is even more sufficient to demonstrate the hesitation of the silver purchasing bill. If, as Thomas said, the government has no sincerity in using silver as a genuine currency, then the principle of bimetallism in the silver bill will not be abandoned.</p>
<p>From our observation, the movement for bimetallism in the United States was initiated by silver faction figures, and there is no foundation for the broad interests of the entire United States in between. Using the silver production value of less than ten million U.S. dollars as the standard for the rise and fall of all values in the United States, judging from the national economy of the United States today, it is not only impossible in fact, but there is also no absolute need for it. Therefore, the so-called bimetallism movement can really be said to be a kind of delusion of silver faction figures. Moreover, in view of changes in the domestic and international situation, silver faction figures are now independently lowering the advertised silver price to $1 per ounce, hoping to finally become legal tender. There is already a trend of knowing the difficulty and retreating. When Pittman and Thomas and others set off to investigate in the future and obtain considerable results, the future of U.S. silver policy will inevitably undergo more significant changes. This can be asserted.</p>

<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas proposed a bill today asking the Treasury Department to immediately proceed with the government's silver purchasing policy. Thomas said that he would urge the government to proceed with this proposal during the next congressional term beginning on January 3 next year. This proposal calls for the continued purchase of silver until the ratio of silver to gold reaches 25:75, or until the silver price reaches $1.29. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed Thomas' proposal requiring the Treasury Department to earnestly implement the silver purchasing plan, and requiring the United States to discuss the issue of using silver as a currency standard when participating in any international monetary or stabilization conference. At the same time, McCarren's bill to abolish the silver profits tax has also been passed by the Senate as a separate bill today and sent to the House of Representatives, but it will most likely disappear invisibly in the House of Representatives, because government leaders have indicated that they will not bring it up on the floor, and even if it is brought up, it will fail. Silver faction members have also admitted that there is little hope of passage. (25th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance is currently rushing to calculate the budget estimates of each ministry in order to organize them, as it must convene the first budget ministry meeting at Finance Minister Takahashi's villa in Hayama at 9:00 AM on the 26th in order to determine the iron rules for determining next year's budget. However, according to the results known as of the 24th, the number of new requests has reached 859 million yuan. There are still the 180 million yuan for the Army's Manchurian Incident expenses to be submitted at the end of this month, and the approximately 300 million yuan reserved by various ministries, which are not included. If these are added to the calculation, the total amount of new requests is still above 1.1 billion yuan. If this is combined with the base budget of 1.661 billion yuan, then the total budget for next year will exceed 2.8 billion yuan, and the difficulty of compiling the budget is actually greater than this year. Furthermore, judging from the status of the new requests submitted by various ministries, the Army accounts for 150 million yuan, the Navy accounts for 285 million yuan, and national defense expenses account for more than 50% of the new requests. Although the Ministry of Finance still hopes for the cooperation of various ministries, in reality, when compiling the budget, the question of whether it is possible to achieve a win-win situation for the military, agriculture, and finance with this huge amount of national defense expenditure is a major doubt. The total number of new requests from each ministry is listed below, with their main points separated.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden. Recently, foreign warships have been conducting exercises near the Swedish coast. It is said that they belong to the Soviet Union. This matter has been discussed again in today's evening papers. The naval authorities in Karlskrona have dispatched a tugboat to inspect and saw twelve destroyers quickly sail away. It is rumored that these destroyers conducted exercises in Swedish territorial waters, and one of them passed through territorial waters with its lights off, which is difficult to confirm. However, it seems credible that a submarine entered territorial waters. Some fishermen's nets in territorial waters have been destroyed. The Navy Department has recently announced that it is conducting an investigation into this matter in conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) According to the Soviet industrialization plan, the food distributed in the cafeterias of factories throughout the country is manufactured in large quantities by specialized factories. The number of people eating there every day is as high as 20 million, most of whom are workers. However, the quality of the food produced by the food factories is rough, and since the "food voucher" system was abolished, ordinary people can buy freely on the market. The number of people eating in factory cafeterias is therefore decreasing day by day, and the business of food factories is becoming increasingly depressed. The accumulated debts of the cafeterias amount to as much as 15 million rubles. Newspapers have recently published articles demanding improvement of food, with a cleaner texture, saying that this is the only way to attract customers. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Italian people are currently attracted by the historical question of "What will England do?", and the Italian army of more than 500,000 men, led by Prime Minister Mussolini, has gathered on the Austrian border, preparing to begin major exercises tomorrow. In order to experiment with the various characteristics of new-era tactics, the simulated battles will be held in four parts: (1) north of Milan, (2) northeast of the border, (3) near Naples, and (4) near Bolzano. All Italian men who can be mobilized will be used to drill this simulated battle. Mussolini has ordered all members of the cabinet and vice ministers to participate. The main exercise will be held in Bolzano, where there are many mountains and forests, and it will be of particular interest because it will be attended by the Da Batchi aviation team. The Italian king has arrived there, and Mussolini will arrive on Sunday. This major exercise will also serve as a war exercise for attacking Abyssinia, and to silence those who say that Mussolini's power cannot protect the northern border. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The major army exercises have already begun. Since midnight yesterday, the atmosphere in the north has been like wartime. All cities and villages have turned off their lights, and most roads have been closed to traffic by the traffic management bureau. Army Vice Minister General Pesto Loco welcomed King Emmanuel III in the city of Trondheim yesterday morning. The diplomatic corps and military officers from England, France, Germany, Belgium, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union went to visit. Important figures from the Italian political world, as well as 200 members of parliament, 40 senators, and 15 ministers and vice ministers, also went to visit.</p>
<p>(Rome) Several of the senators are military officers. Among them, Senator Weitai Ershani, Speaker of the Senate, was originally an artillery officer. The major exercises in northern Italy are progressing rapidly after the completion of the transportation organization for the troops. Active troops and mechanized troops have now set off for the Bolzano area. At the same time, four fascist volunteer corps are also drilling in this area. At the same time, the exercises in the Sanio area have begun yesterday under the review of the Crown Prince. (25th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Bolzano City. Bolzano City is located in the province of South Tyrol. In the Middle Ages, this city was originally a small fief, but was later annexed by Italy. The major army exercises are being held here, as well as in the Udine and Bergamo areas. As a result, the troops are concentrated here. The local hotels are all full. Many ministers, vice ministers, army generals, and journalists have come here to visit. It can be called a temporary boom. Prime Minister Mussolini will also visit. The theme of the major exercises is to assume that the enemy is attacking from the north, descending along the Adige and Isarco rivers, and making every effort to capture the Brenner Pass. (The border between Italy and Austria). The center of Italian resistance and the starting point for a counterattack is in the Adige River basin. There are 160,000 Italian troops, not including the troops concentrated in the vicinity. This contingent was mobilized from the provinces of Piedmont and Lombardy and the Alps near the French border. The policy of cooperation between Italy and France is being realized. The strategic position of the Italian army is based on the assumption that the enemy has already crossed the Brenner Pass and moved south to a certain point between the cities of Bolzano and Trondheim. The entire force has more than one army, and there is one division of motorized troops and several units of Alpine troops to support it. The Italian army has two armies and one division each of Alpine troops and motorized troops. King Emmanuel III is currently observing the exercises in the city of Trondheim and will not return until the end of the major exercises. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bolzano. 500,000 troops, with infantry and cavalry complete, also have those riding in trucks, tanks, and armored vehicles. At dawn tomorrow, they will head north to fight the hypothetical enemy in the White Lena Mountain Road. At that time, it will be assumed that the enemy has invaded Italy from the German-Austrian border by forty miles, in order to test the effectiveness of mechanized troops in the Alba Mountain area. Observers believe that this move is also Italy's way of indicating that while using troops in East Africa, it is not neglecting the defense of the northern border. (24th National Er)</p>

<p>(London) The renowned chief writer of *The Observer*, Gavin, recently published an article saying, "Since Britain and Italy established an agreement in 1887, the British Navy's deployment of defenses in the Mediterranean has been based on Anglo-Italian friendship. This agreement was originally wise. The current situation is no longer comparable to the past, and the sea route from the Strait of Gibraltar, Malta, Egypt to Aden is the lifeline of the British Empire and must be taken into consideration. Now that Italy is hostile, it is difficult for Britain to guarantee the safety of sea routes in the Mediterranean. It is a shameful matter that the air force strength of some countries in the Mediterranean is far stronger than that of Britain. Even considering the strength of the British Navy, it is probably inferior. Britain in this area is practically being played by Italy. No wonder Italy is arrogant and overbearing. It is now impossible for us to independently safeguard the Indian route from Gibraltar to Aden. To return to bypassing the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa to reach India, in short, Britain has neglected national defense for several years, and as a result, the Abyssinian issue has arisen.

<p>(Berlin) The *Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung* recently commented on the Italo-Abyssinian issue, saying, "Italy's demand to expand its colonies is perfectly reasonable. When the European War broke out, Italy joined the Allied side, and there was a secret agreement that it would assist the Allies in the war as a condition. However, after the war, when spoils were divided, Italy gained nothing. Although some rights and interests were given later, they were not enough to satisfy Italy's desires. Moreover, the country's population has increased in recent years, and the country already feels overpopulated. This is similar to the situation in Japan, and thus it has a demand to expand its colonies. However, from Germany's standpoint, if plans to redistribute colonies in Africa are to be reconsidered at this time, then Germany not only has the intention but also the right to participate in the matter. Since the Treaty of Versailles was established, Germany has been forced to remain in Central Europe, and its territory has been reduced. For the sake of national survival, it is necessary to expand its colonial bases to obtain raw materials." The newspaper also stated that when the Locarno Treaties were negotiated and when the Young Plan was negotiated in Paris, the German colonial issue was mentioned by the relevant countries. Some politicians on the Allied side also acknowledged that Germany's restoration of colonial activity was a legitimate act. Interior Minister Frick recently also stated that there are various conditions for Germany's return to the League of Nations, one of which is the return of the original colonies to Germany.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt delivered a radio address to the nation today, urging young people across the country to move forward in the new construction of the country. This address was originally addressed to the Milwaukee Young Democrats Convention. In his speech, President Roosevelt spoke of his administrative philosophy and his ideas for reforming the old order. He said, "We must make our thinking adapt to today's realities. I have one piece of advice for young people of all parties in America, namely, unity and struggle. Regulations need not be sacred, but principles are. Some of you may think that the methods of the old order are beyond the reach of young people's struggle, but this is not the case." President Roosevelt then attacked world conservatism, saying that reactionary forces often defeat progressive forces because conservatives around the world unite and hold the same old ground. Therefore, do not risk the danger of straying into many paths that lead to ruin. The old era often aimed at great wealth, but I am convinced that the new young people of America will value the abundance of life more than the overflow of wealth. In the era of George Washington, the first President of the United States, the regulations governing the relationship between blacksmith shop owners and employees could certainly no longer govern the relationship between a large company's 50,000 employees and its complex shareholders."

<p>(Washington) After the Congressional adjournment bill was passed by the Senate today, Congress was scheduled to adjourn tonight, but the House and Senate had a fierce dispute over the third supplementary appropriation bill, so the adjournment was extended to Monday. After temporarily suspending the rule of allowing all discussions, the Senate passed two important amendments to this bill, causing Congressional leaders to find themselves in a state of great confusion.

The Senate then reconvened and asked the House to return the adjournment resolution. This was only a few minutes before the Senate's midnight adjournment. The House immediately returned the adjournment bill as requested. The Senate then decided to cancel it and did not record the vote count. Senator Robinson moved that the Senate temporarily adjourn until Monday, which was approved. The cotton loan amendment was passed without recording the vote count, and the wheat loan amendment was passed by a vote of 41 to 23. These two were an open rebellion by Southern senators against the nine-cent cotton loan announced by the authorities on Thursday. The government did not think so. Senator Byrnes said when he introduced his amendment that cotton had fallen by five dollars per bale since the nine-cent loan was announced, causing Southern cotton farmers to lose 55 million dollars, and that cotton currently under the government's one-and-two-cent loan had also lost 25 million dollars. The AAA's one-and-two-cent guarantee for cotton prices was purely illusory. If cotton farmers are forced to sell their cotton at nine cents, and the average price for the four months before January 2 is one and a half cents, then the government subsidy is only one cent, and cotton farmers actually only get one cent. The Vice President and Senators Robinson, Byrnes, and Congressman Buchanan held a meeting that lasted a long time, but</p>

<p>failed to resolve the deadlock. Congressman Buchanan made an impassioned speech in the House opposing the amendment, saying that it would cost tens of millions of dollars and that Congress could adjourn without dealing with this bill. After this bill was included in the amendment, it is now dead. The House cannot pass it this year. The supplementary appropriations bill is the third one proposed by this Congress, involving 95 million dollars in funding, which is intended to provide funding for the newly established Social Security Administration and the government's proposed unemployment insurance system, old-age pension system, coal bill, and neutrality bill. Buchanan said that after this bill is shelved, President Roosevelt can find other ways to finance the Social Security Administration. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate passed several bills tonight. The more important ones include the following three: (1) The "Wealth Redistribution Bill". The Senate voted on the issue of taxation on large amounts of property, but it did not advocate the collection of estate inheritance tax. (2) Regarding subsidies for ocean shipping, a bill was previously passed authorizing the President to cancel this subsidy within a reasonable period of time. Last night, the Senate passed a bill extending this period. (3) Regarding the bill to adjust public utilities and private companies, the House of Representatives recently passed a compromise bill and sent it to the Senate for review. It was passed by the Senate last night. In addition, the Senate also (1) approved the Treaty of Friendship between the United States and Germany and revoked the most-favored-nation clause in the treaty, (2) abolished the most-favored-nation clause in several multilateral economic agreements, (3) approved an addendum to the extradition treaty between the United States and Belgium, (4) approved the treaty between the United States and Mexico on the issue of territorial waters. Also, during the discussions in both houses today, President Roosevelt sent letters to the chairmen of the committees of both houses, requesting that they draft a bill in the fall to replace the National Industrial Recovery Act, saying, "Since the government implemented various recovery regulations in the past two years, the working class has indeed gained various benefits, but since the recovery regulations were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and thus abolished, the living standards of workers have suffered a serious blow. Congress should urgently pass laws so that the benefits gained by the working class can be permanently maintained." (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed the House's amended Neutrality Act and has now sent it to President Roosevelt for his signature. The aim of the bill is to maintain the neutrality of the United States in the event of war in Europe. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Charitable Donations Act has been sent to the White House for signature today. President Roosevelt's proposed new inheritance tax has been deleted and replaced with an increase in existing estate and gift taxes. An amendment proposed by Senator Borah, advocating that bonds exempt from taxation should not be issued in the future, was rejected by a joint conference of both houses. The original form of the bill was to increase the income tax for those with incomes above 50,000 dollars. According to this calculation, the national revenue could increase by 250 million to 270 million dollars annually. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Wheeler-Rayburn Public Utility Holding Company Act, after months of debate, was sent to the White House for signature today. Both houses of Congress approved a compromise solution with swift action. The House, which had previously opposed the crackdown on holding companies, first passed it by a vote of 222 to 112. The Senate, with the support of the government and the support of progressives, of course also passed it immediately. It is likely that President Roosevelt will soon sign it into law.

<h3 id="e58">Parisian Youths, Invent a New Navigational Aid, A Small Lighthouse Emitting Radio Waves, Can Detect Obstacles in the Dark Night and Dense Fog <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Pondemarice, a graduate of the École Normale Supérieure, and Henry Coudène, son of Coudène, a member of the Académie des Sciences, both young men of thirty years old, have invented a new navigational aid as a result of years of research. Once installed and adopted by ships sailing the ocean, even heavy fog or broken hulls hidden beneath the surface of the water cannot hinder navigation. Recently, one unit was installed on the giant ship "Normandie" and the test results were good. Other ships will also be installed and used. This new navigational aid is a small lighthouse installed on the front of the vessel, emitting very short radio waves rather than light rays. Ordinary light rays can only reach the places illuminated by the light rays, but the short radio waves emitted by this lighthouse can still propagate unhindered even in heavy fog or in the dark of night. If there are no obstacles ahead, these radio waves will disappear naturally. If there are obstacles ahead, the radio waves will be reflected and can be received by a second lighthouse, allowing one to detect the source of the obstacles. These two types of lighthouses, A and B, are each eight centimeters in diameter and seven and a half centimeters in depth. One emits and one receives, alternating for use, so that the location of obstacles ahead of navigation, its exact direction, and its distance, cannot escape the detection of radio waves. During the recent test of the giant ship "Normandie", the lighthouse was installed on the deck, seven kilometers from the shore. The factory chimney on land and the location of the chimney could be clearly seen, and the good results can be seen. This invention was first made by Pondé in the physics laboratory of the École Normale Supérieure, who diligently studied the effects of radio waves and obtained this result. Now, Coudène and Pondé are working together to continue to study the principles of sound and light transfer. The detection method described above is now ready, and its practical effect is not limited to one aspect. Especially in the dark sky, detecting the movement of aircraft can also be applied. This instrument emits radio waves to detect whether there are obstacles ahead, but the method used for aircraft and ships is different, and the equipment for viewing the four sides, front, back, left, and right, will naturally be more complicated.

<p>Beiping Correspondence, North China Sino-Japanese Relations, Increasingly Close, After the arrival of Japanese Military Commander stationed in Tianjin, Tada Hayao, in Beiping, this morning (24th) at 9 o'clock, accompanied by his entourage and the Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Takahashi Tano, visited Wang Kemin of the Political Readjustment Council for a courtesy call after assuming office, then visited Bao Wen-yue of the Military Branch, and finally visited Yuan Liang of the Beiping Municipal Government, after which he returned to the Japanese Consulate. From 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM, he received greetings from various Chinese and foreign parties. From 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, he held a tea party at the Japanese Embassy to entertain Chinese and foreign officials. The following is a separate account of Tada Hayao's remarks and the establishment of special service agencies by the Japanese side in North China.</p>
<p>Tada Hayao Discusses International Relations</p>
<p>Tada Hayao will return to Tianjin tomorrow (25th) and is scheduled to inspect Yuguan on the 27th. On his way back, he will review the Japanese army in Luanxian and Tangshan. Tada Hayao recently issued the following statement: "I first came to Beiping in the sixth year of the Republic of China and served as an instructor at the Army University until the ninth year before returning to my country. In the fifteenth year, I came to Beiping again, and in the sixteenth year, I returned to my country and have not come again since. In total, I lived in Beiping for six years. Now that I have come to Beiping again, passing through Zhengyangmen and the surrounding area, I see that the city gate tower is still the same, but the prosperity is not as it used to be, which is quite touching. Regarding the issue of improving Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, although Chairman Chiang and the Chinese Central Government have repeatedly expressed their determination to adopt a pro-Japanese policy, the psychology of the people is difficult to change immediately. Therefore, Sino-Japanese relations will be difficult to fully restore to normal immediately. I sincerely hope that the people and authorities of the two countries will work hard, have patience and courage, to make the people of the two countries become compatriots, and hope that the people of the two countries treat each other with sincerity. Both sides should be able to work together, and superficial courtesies cannot achieve satisfactory results. This point is very important. Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China, I am not aware of the details, but from my personal observations, the lives of the people in North China are currently very difficult, and their purchasing power is very low. It is necessary to find ways to save them, and implementing economic cooperation is also a way to save them. However, whether it is politics, economy, or diplomacy, only mutual benefit for both sides can allow progress. Economic cooperation should also be based on this point. Although the cases in Hebei and Chahar have come to an end, the Japanese side hopes that your country will quickly apprehend the murderer in the Liu Zuo Zhou case, etc."</p>
<p>Takeshita Takes Office in Yuguan</p>
<p>The head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan, Igi, has been ordered to return to Tokyo, and his vacancy will be filled by Takeshita Yoshiharu. It is reported that Takeshita arrived in Yuguan from Shenyang via Japan on the 21st and took over the office of the head of the Special Service Agency. After Igi personally handed over the duties, he left for Shenyang that night to return to his country. Takeshita is scheduled to come to Beiping and Tianjin tomorrow (25th) to visit the Chinese authorities. Li County Chief of Qian'an and Feng County Chief of Lulong arrived in Yuguan on the night of the 21st to visit Takeshita and discuss methods for suppressing bandits at the Great Wall passes, and also met with Su Yuqi to discuss important matters.</p>
<p>Increased Establishment of Special Service Agencies</p>
<p>The Japanese military authorities had previously sent personnel to Shanxi and Suiyuan to investigate and considered it necessary to establish special service agencies in these areas. It has already been decided to establish a special service agency in both Suiyuan and Taiyuan. Yu Shan, the head of the Suiyuan Special Service Agency, arrived in Beiping on the 20th and is scheduled to take office in Suiyuan within the next few days. The Japanese side also plans to establish a special service agency in the provincial capital of Ningxia. (24th)</p>

<h3 id="e78">Kong Lingrong Discusses The Difficulty of Blocking Yellow River Breaches The Raging Flood Must Be Diverted A Complete Blunder by Jiangsu Province in Building Dikes for Interception <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, Since the Yellow River breached its banks in Juancheng on July 10th, the flood has moved eastward, splitting at Wanglaohuji in Yuncheng, flowing south into Nanyang Lake and north into Dongping Lake (i.e., the Dongping low-lying depression), and then returning to the main river. Northern Jiangsu is feared to be affected by the flood. In addition to repairing the Weishan Lake dike, the Linjiaba dam has also been blocked to prevent the flood from invading south. However, due to the excessive volume of water from the breach and the strong source, the water flowing into lakes such as Nanyang, Zhaoyang, and Shushan is unable to discharge due to the obstruction of Jiangsu, resulting in widespread flooding. In recent days, not only have Tengxian and Zexian on the eastern shore of the lake breached their banks one after another, flooding the Jinpu Railway, but the Lanjia Dam has also been washed away, and water has flooded Xuzhou. Northern Jiangsu's plan to block water and prevent it from being discharged has completely failed. Recently, a water-blocking dam has been built to guard the third line of defense. The evolution of the water situation is not yet known. Kong Lingrong, Director of the Shandong Canal Engineering Bureau, recently expressed his views on the floods in Jiangsu and Shandong, arguing that the only current plan is to urgently seek diversion and discharge, and to follow the resolution of the Economic Commission's Yellow River Prevention Conference to guide the water into the sea through the proper route. The interception by Northern Jiangsu proves its misjudgment. If it continues to be insisted upon, obstructing the waterway, the disaster area in Western Shandong will expand, and Northern Jiangsu will also be swept into the flood, cutting off both the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. The Huai River diversion project will also be completely destroyed. The original text of the opinion is thousands of words long and discusses the matter in great detail. Currently, it is being revised in writing. The key points are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Blocking Breaches At Present</p>
<p>After the Yellow River breaches its banks, the riverbed gradually rises, while the terrain outside the embankment is low-lying. Water flows downward, discharging for thousands of miles. The water volume from the breach accounts for nine-tenths of the total water volume, while the water in the main river is only one-tenth. Since the two major floods, there have been dramatic changes in the breach's mouth. The main current rolls eastward, and the original first, second, third, and fourth breach mouths are completely silted up, while the main river can be crossed by wading. The Yellow River carries a large amount of sediment, which is most abundant during floods, and silting is also most severe. Based on the current situation, it is feared that the current main river will be completely filled with silt, and water will be discharged from the breach mouth, resulting in a change in the river's course. Moreover, it is currently the flood season, and the rise and fall of the river water are unpredictable, and the current's momentum will also change repeatedly. The future of the breach mouth may not change its shape again. As for the breach-blocking work, progress is very slow due to the lack of funds and materials. Currently, a branch road is being laid from Lanfeng to Dongbatou, and ships are being prepared to transport supplies, which will take at least four months to complete. In addition, an diversion canal must be dug to reduce the water volume at the breach mouth before the breach-blocking work can begin. Currently, only work such as transporting materials, digging diversion canals, blocking dry breaches, and making wrapping heads can be done.</p>
<p>Jiangsu's Misjudgment in Obstructing Water</p>
<p>According to current measurements, the water from the breach is 54 meters higher than sea level (taking the Jianghuai sea outlet as the base point). Measurements ten days ago showed that the water level of the Shanhu Lake was 20 meters lower than the water from the breach. With the rising water level in recent days, the water level should also be 18 meters lower than the water from the breach. This proves that Jiangsu's dike construction is a complete misjudgment. The dike must be raised by another 18 meters to prevent the breach water from invading south. However, this is not possible in reality, because if the dike is raised further, Northern Jiangsu's abundance will be flooded, and the isolated dry land of Shanxian and Chengwu in Western Shandong will also be submerged in water. As for the water level at the Hanzhuang Sluice Gate, it has now reached 36.3 meters. During the major flood fifteen years ago, the water level was 36.5 meters. Comparing the two, the difference is only slightly over 1 decimeter. With such a strong water force, it is inevitable that the Lanjia Dam and the Hanzhuang Sluice Gate will be washed away. Currently, the flood water rushes out from the breach, with a flow rate of 5,000 cubic meters per second, flowing into the disaster area. The momentum has stabilized somewhat, and the flow rate is approximately 2,600 cubic meters per second. With such a large volume of water and such a high flow rate, it will inevitably flood if it cannot be properly diverted and discharged. Jiangsu does not know how to guide the water into the sea, but only knows how to block it. The unprecedented flood disaster in Northern Jiangsu has already proven that its previous policies were a complete failure.</p>
<p>Divert and Discharge Should Be Planned</p>
<p>To fundamentally reduce the flood disasters in Jiangsu and Shandong, the only solution is to block the breach, but blocking the breach is currently impossible. The current priority should be to quickly study the method of official diversion and discharge. There are approximately several solutions: (1) Dig the Linjiaba dam to divert water into the Bulao River, reinforce the southern embankment of the Bulao River, enter the Central Canal from the Bulao River, reinforce the eastern embankment of the canal, and build an outer embankment on the Central Canal below Qutangji, and then discharge it into the sea through the Liutang River. Its capacity can discharge approximately 1,000 cubic meters per second. Divert water into the Central Canal from the Hanzhuang Lake outlet gate and also discharge it into the sea through Liutang, which can discharge approximately 600 cubic meters per second. (2) The northern flow of the breach water can be discharged into the Yellow River through the Jishui flood plains of Pingyi, with a capacity of 400 cubic meters per second. It can be discharged into the Yellow River through the Songjin River, with a capacity of 600 cubic meters per second. In summary, the amount of water discharged from the north and south routes above is 2,600 cubic meters per second, which is not much different from the flow rate of the breach water, and the water situation should no longer flood. (3) Starting from the old course of the Yellow River in Fengxian County, build a north-south large dike of approximately 300 li in length to prevent the Yellow River water from flooding westward. (4) Leave several outlets in the old course of the Yellow River north of Xuzhou and create wrapping heads, which can also absorb a portion of the water and reduce the flooded area in Xuzhou and Huai'an.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhaozhen, the manager of the Dadong Hotel on the road, was found to have privately established an organization to sell substandard silkworm seeds and raise seed prices. After investigation by the Supervision Department of the Public Security Bureau, Zhang Zhaozhen, Zhang Gu's, Wang Shenglin, Zheng Jianshu, and others were arrested and transferred to the County Government for interrogation and detention. Meanwhile, the County Magistrate reported the situation to the Department of Construction and requested instructions. It is reported that the Department of Construction severely punished them in accordance with the Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Seed Control Regulations, imposing a fine of ten times the amount (approximately over 20,000 yuan) to prevent other seed vendors from raising seed prices again.</p>

<p>Recently, the market price of copper coins in the town has plummeted. At the highest, each yuan reached around 3,600 cash, causing significant harm to merchants. The reason for the sharp decline is that some people are privately selling large quantities of copper coins from counties such as Yixing and Liyang to Wuxi because each yuan can be exchanged for around 3,700 cash there. Xu Ruzhou, a standing committee member of the town's Liquor and Sauce Shop Association, and Shi Qinglin, a standing committee member of the Tobacco Exchange Association, submitted a petition to the County Government yesterday, requesting that it issue a strict prohibition and investigation of private sales to maintain business.</p>

<p>The first joint meeting of standing directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Flood Relief in Various Provinces was held at Renji Hall yesterday at 4 PM. Attendees included Vice Presidents Xu Shiying, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Yiting, all standing directors and supervisors, directors and deputy directors of various groups, and over fifty people including Ma Yinliang from the press. Vice President Xu chaired the meeting, which passed eight important resolutions before adjourning at 6:30 PM. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reports from Various Groups on Progress</p>
<p>After formal greetings, each group reported on their activities from the date of establishment to August 24th, having received a total of 188 documents and telegrams, and dispatched 162. They received relief funds amounting to 42,269.09 national currency, along with relief goods including four bags of fried rice, twenty bags of white rice, 228 pieces of old clothing,  one piece of [unidentified item], 400 bottles of dysentery powder, 24 boxes of cholera medicine, 20,000 packets of Bagua Dan, 20,000 packets of headache powder, 120 bottles of Pujishui, 9,570 bottles of Shiyishui, 400 bottles of Jisheng Dan, 400 bottles of Jiuji Dan, 1,200 packets of [unidentified] Dan, 500 bottles of Bao'an Shui, 1,000 pieces of Peng Qu, 1,000 packets of Wushicha, 300 bottles of Lei San, and 600 packets of malaria medicine.

<p>Baker Aircraft's Inspection Opinions</p>
<p>The chairman then reported on the inspection of disaster conditions in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Hebei along the Yellow River. (Details were already seen in yesterday's interview with Mr. Xu.) He also released the opinion of Consultant Baker to Vice President Xu, after flying over the disaster area of the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The original text is as follows: From the 15th to 17th of this month, I accompanied engineers from the National Economic Council and others, aboard [unidentified] aircraft, to survey the disaster areas. I will now describe what I saw and the opinions I gathered: (1) Shandong: Flying along the railway from Jinan to Jining, northward to the intersection of the Grand Canal and the Yellow River, then along the Yellow River to view the breaches, and then turning eastward back to Jining, forming a triangle. Along the route, there was very little flooding east of the Grand Canal. Some [unidentified] lake land, which could be cultivated when the water was shallow, is now submerged, but the area is not extensive. West of the Grand Canal, within the triangle traversed by the plane, is a vast expanse of water, estimated to be 2,800 square miles. Excluding the various lakes, both large and small, and the higher ground that has not been submerged, there are still 2,000 square miles under water. However, in many areas, the water is only a few feet deep, and in some places, the land has already emerged. If no further flooding occurs, cultivation will be possible in half a month. Two-thirds of the current flow of the Yellow River is diverted through the breach into the triangle, and then back into the Yellow River itself via the Grand Canal. Therefore, a total of 95% of the Yellow River's flow still follows its original course, with only a small portion diverted into the Grand Canal. Near the breach in the Yellow River dyke, the river mud has accumulated, burying villages, with only the rooftops visible. It is estimated that in the future, the ground within one or two miles of the breach will be elevated by two or three feet due to the accumulation of silt. The remaining submerged land will also be raised by several inches. Whether this silt is beneficial or harmful to agriculture cannot be determined without experimentation. When the plane passed over Jinan, the number of refugees seen in the straw sheds along the railway was not large, suggesting that most refugees have already left for other places or returned to their homes. The dyke built by the Jiangsu provincial authorities at Huishan Lake, which successfully prevented the Yellow River from overflowing into Jiangsu, is noteworthy. (2) Poyang Lake: On the 16th, [unidentified] circled Poyang Lake. The eastern part of the lake is mostly high ground, and except for a small portion along the shore, there are no signs of disaster. The western and southern parts of the lake are mostly marshes and shallows, which can be cultivated for spring crops, or in dry years, for autumn crops. However, as this land is inherently part of the lake, it is naturally intended to accommodate excess lake water and has no dykes for defense. Therefore, the current flooding cannot be considered a disaster. (3) The low-lying and滩地 along the Jinghan Railway and the Yangtze River are all submerged, but this cannot be considered a disaster, as this type of submerged land [unidentified] can be cultivated for spring crops and is typically submerged by the river water during the summer floods. The Yangtze River dykes are all behind this type of land and are intact, except for one place in Anhui. The breach in the dyke in Anhui was built after the 1931 flood. The inner dyke was breached, and the reclaimed lake will [unidentified] revert to its former state. (4) Han River dyke Sai He: On the afternoon of the 16th, [unidentified] water [unidentified] surveyed along the Han [unidentified]. Northwest of Hankou, there is a low-lying area that originally produced [unidentified] weeds, used for making baskets and mats. Now, it is a large lake. When the water from the Dong River recedes, the water there will naturally flow out. West and south of [unidentified] Han, there are large tracts of land, [unidentified] a collection of many low-lying areas. As usual, this type of low-lying area is filled with water during this time of year. Now, the fields along the edges of each low-lying area are also submerged. However, this situation is common during periods of extremely high water levels and is not unusual. The current water level of the Yangtze River at Hankou is around 43.8 feet. After the unusual [unidentified] period, and as the water continues to recede northward, the water in the aforementioned low-lying areas will also naturally recede. Furthermore, the people who cultivate this type of land can be called [unidentified] reclaiming people. Because this type of land is not privately owned and is necessary for regulating the river's capacity, it is highly questionable whether the government and society have a responsibility to provide relief to these encroaching people. If the government does have a responsibility, it seems to fall on the provincial government, not the central government. Flying further north, the two major breaches in the Nang River were seen. The river water rushed into the dyke, spreading rapidly, so the water on the ground was only a few inches deep. The submerged area is smaller than when the flood first came. Some of the land has emerged, and farmers have begun to cultivate it. The accompanying engineers said that the sediment deposited by the breaches contains a lot of sand, which is harmful to the soil. Some of the land needs to wait until the water from the breaches stops flowing before it can be cultivated. Many farmers have already returned to their fields. In total, in western Hubei, excluding the lakes and swamps that are inherently uncultivable, the area currently submerged does not exceed 600 square miles. (5) On the 17th, flew around Dongting Lake and along the Yangtze River to Yichang. The situation in Dongting Lake is similar to that in Poyang Lake. The eastern part of Dongting Lake is higher in elevation, and only the fields along the shore have been submerged at some point or are still submerged, with no signs of disaster. The land on the west and south sides of the lake is formed by lake sediment, with a wide area and extremely humid conditions, where lotus roots and reeds are grown. Now, it is a sheet of water, indistinguishable from the lake. Some of it could have been planted with rice during extremely dry periods, and some dry rice has been planted, but it has also been submerged. Although this type of land is surrounded by dykes, the engineering is not strong. The water level of the lake this time is not much higher than usual, and there is no impact from floods, but all the dykes have collapsed. It can be seen that the engineering is careless. Some believe that the mud carried by the lake water, after the water recedes, will remain on the ground, increasing the productivity of the land. Farmers benefit from the silt, so they build dykes along the lake shore with the intention of merely going through the motions. If so, then the people in that area seem to have no need for relief. Along the Yangtze River from Shashi to Songzi, the submerged land on both banks has now completely emerged, and cultivation has begun. The residents who live by the water may have needed aid at the beginning of the flood, but now they are able to use their own resources and abilities to engage in work. In total, the area of fields in western Hunan that are still under water does not exceed 600 square miles. (6) Conclusion: From the above observations, only a portion of the area along the Xiang River in Hubei Province needs urgent relief. In other disaster areas, disaster victims can be assisted by establishing credit cooperatives to implement agricultural assistance. After engineers have drafted plans for building and repairing dykes, disaster victims can also be recruited to rebuild houses. They should be [unidentified] to raise the ridge of their houses. During this flood, except for those very close to the breaches, the foundations of houses [unidentified] high could be preserved intact. As for the relief in Hunan Province, the province's efforts are sufficient, and the province's relief agencies can handle it independently. The province should pay special attention to the grain storage system. Grain stored in good years can be used to regulate the needs of bad years. The surplus of one county can supplement the deficiency of Zheng. Even within a county, the land varies in elevation, and there are different fortunes depending on drought or continuous rain. If more warehouses can be set up, they can effectively regulate the supply. The situation in Poyang Lake seems to require no attention. What should be paid most attention to now is the situation within the triangle of the Yellow River and the Grand Canal in Shandong Province. The Shandong Provincial Government has moved disaster victims out for food. Now, in the autumn harvest season, disaster victims should be summoned back to rebuild their homes. What is needed is agricultural assistance. After engineers have drafted plans for repairing dykes, the strong men among the disaster victims can work on the dykes and be given appropriate compensation to support themselves and their families. Farmers who rebuild houses should also be encouraged to raise the foundations, so that in the future, even if they encounter floods, if they are not in the path of the rapid flow from the breach, they can be preserved after the water recedes. The conclusion drawn from this trip is that the current method of preventing floods is still to focus on strengthening and raising the dykes. The government needs to have an improved organization and equipment to engage in this, not only to maintain the dykes in peacetime, but also to be able to cope with emergencies. Fortunately, the Yangtze River dykes were able to resist the flood, demonstrating the flood control effectiveness of [unidentified] construction. The dykes at the breach of [unidentified] River were not built by the National Flood Relief Association after the 1931 flood. The cause of the Yellow River breach is not difficult to investigate. The reason is the negligence of the dyke work. However, no matter how strong a dyke is, it can still be breached under extraordinary circumstances. Therefore, there should also be plans for how to cope with breaches in peacetime. Such as this time the breach of Xiang River, or may think that is not any dyke body can support, therefore on one hand should have [unidentified] effectiveness emergency relief organization, on the other hand should have improved [unidentified] dyke organization, and [unidentified] the opportunity of flood and the need of relief, [unidentified] can be reduced.</p>

<p>Joint Sino-Foreign Survey Report on the Disaster</p>
<p>Mr. Xu further reported on the report by Zhang Qichun, chief engineer of the China International Famine Relief Commission, and others, after inspecting the Shandong flood area. The inspection lasted a total of nine days, starting from Jining and returning to Jining on the 16th. Most of the journey was through rural areas, with only the cities of Jiaxiang and Juye. Upstream from Yansikou, the journey stopped due to sediment accumulation that made further progress impossible. In terms of population, the rural areas are more densely populated than the cities. Standing on the bow of the boat, with a telescope, more than thirty villages can be surveyed per hour. During this nine-day trip, only two places were seen that were not under water: one was a part of [unidentified] village, exposed above the water by less than two feet, and the other was a large mound with a small temple on it. During the first 24 hours, the only living things seen were one cow, one horse, and four sheep, standing on a mound. Most of the local houses are built of mud [unidentified], and have sunk [unidentified], so nine out of ten are [unidentified]. The number of uninhabited villages [unidentified] can be calculated. No less than 6,000 villages have been submerged. Jining has already moved 66,891 [unidentified] refugees out of the area, and more than 20,000 people are waiting for trains to move out. There are 15,000 disaster victims in Jiaxiang and 5,000 in Juye. The authorities are working hard on relief efforts, but the increasing depth of the water makes it very difficult to transport food to the more remote villages and to rescue the disaster victims to Jining. Only one village has one week's worth of food left. In some places, efforts are being made to rescue the elderly and young children under 50 and under 15 years old first. Some disaster victims who spoke to me have expressed despair because they have no food or boats and have no way to escape. According to the postal map, the population in the disaster area is the densest in Shandong Province. If the average population of the province is 500 people per square mile, then the original population in the disaster area must be more than 700 people per square mile. Each household cultivates only 20 to 30 mu of land. It is rare to find someone who has more than 50 mu of land. The density of villages is probably the highest in the country, and the number of victims can be imagined. I met a village where nine out of ten houses had been destroyed. How can we [unidentified] send food to the many compatriots who are still struggling in the water if we cannot navigate a small boat on the [unidentified] deep water surface, to those villages that originally had 4,000 households? It is not easy for Jining, with its local resources, to supply 600 bags of flour per day to the gathering disaster victims. Therefore, the disaster victims must be moved out to other counties [unidentified]. The most needed thing now is urgent relief funds. The number of disaster victims being housed in Jining and other counties is increasing, and fuel and food [unidentified] are becoming increasingly scarce. The future is long, so what will happen in the months to come? Therefore, raising funds for urgent relief is the most important plan at present. As for repairing the dykes, it needs to wait until the water recedes. There are currently 119 shelters in the affected counties, and the winter clothing of disaster victims has no boat. There are also some places where the water is very shallow, so even if there are boats, they cannot travel. And the silt under the water is deep [unidentified], so even wading is impossible. Many disaster victims can only sit and wait for death. In some high places, there are still sorghum ears showing above the water, which are the only remaining possessions. But because they are few in number, they are even more precious. The disaster victims float the vat of water on the surface, tie one end of the rope [unidentified] to the body, or swim or wade, and risk collecting the treasure that has been left behind, and let the women and children flee for the lives of their people, which is praiseworthy. In one village [unidentified] there are two households whose water is five feet deep, and still heard the sounds of children crying and dogs barking [unidentified], because their occupants are still guard its wooden beams doors and windows, and other possessions. We will [unidentified] [unidentified] ethicists will also [unidentified] also, But in the above exposed water and of the place, had seen a [unidentified] from the upper reaches [unidentified] to [unidentified] the door and windows of the village, coffins, and other possessions, (omitted below)</p>
<p>Baker's Proposal: Consult on Solutions</p>
<p>There is also a letter from Consultant Baker to Vice President Xu, proposing to convene a joint meeting of Yellow River water conservancy engineers and relief personnel to discuss a unified approach to engineering and relief work. Briefly, it says, "Attached is a translated report from Zhang Qichun and [unidentified] Lian Kailan after their inspection of the Shandong disaster area. According to the report, there are more than one million disaster victims in the 3,000 square miles, but because the water is shallow and the mud is deep, boats and vehicles are useless and food cannot be transported, so there is a risk of sitting and waiting for death. You must also be well aware of this situation from your inspection. I understand that the water conservancy agencies are planning engineering projects in the area. From the perspective of engineers, they naturally focus on the technology and economics of the project, and disaster relief is not their responsibility, so it will inevitably be beyond the scope of their plans. But in reality, engineering plans have a great impact on relief methods and costs. Therefore, I propose to convene a joint meeting of relevant engineering and relief personnel to discuss the plans together. The participants should include: (1) key personnel and senior engineers from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission; (2) representatives from the Shandong Provincial Relief Association, and representatives from this association. In addition, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Kai [unidentified] should also be invited to join because they are very familiar with the situation in the disaster area. Mr. Zhang is the acting chief engineer of the China International Famine Relief Commission, and Mr. Kailan is the former [unidentified] director of the China International Famine Relief Commission and is currently the accountant. The purpose of the meeting is to coordinate the work of engineering and relief in Shandong to make them mutually supportive. How to transport food in the area should also be a matter of common discussion. If you consider this proposal to be good, please convene the meeting as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Li and Others Launch a Donation Drive</p>
<p>A letter signed by Li Yingsheng and others was sent to the Flood Relief Association yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, we have learned that the Yangtze River provinces have suffered a terrible flood this year, and the loss of lives, livestock, and property is incalculable. It is truly an unprecedented disaster. We are grateful to the gentlemen of your association for your public spirit and righteousness in advocating for the disaster victims and raising funds for disaster relief and local reconstruction. After reading the newspapers, we are very impressed. However, in this time of global economic recession, and with Shanghai's economy becoming increasingly strained, we are deeply concerned that people in society may find it difficult to donate cash, and may feel willing but unable to do so. We propose that your association launch a campaign to allow people to donate goods for relief. For example, our friend Mr. Chen is willing to donate one of his two radios. Mr. Guan Xinxin has an old car and is also willing to donate it. Mr. Huang Xiangchen has dozens of pieces of furniture and other items that a friend did not claim and is also willing to donate them. We believe that if this is done, people who have surplus items or clothing will also be happy to support it. Because friends are reluctant to sell their items for fear of losing face or because they are afraid that pawnshops will offer low prices. If your association does this, it can be quite significant. The collected items should be listed and advertised in the newspaper on a regular basis, and auctions should be held, with the highest bidder winning. People from all walks of life can participate in the bidding, but it is advisable to auction the items separately to avoid the disadvantages of being [unidentified] interrupted. The above benefits both the donors and the recipients. Whether it is feasible, we await your [unidentified] decision. We are doing this for the benefit of the public. Cash donations are also welcome, but there should also be a way to donate goods for relief. If you can donate silver, it would be even better. Li Yingsheng, Ren Daren, Zhou Junjie, Lai Gang."</p>
<p>Party Affairs Handling Relief: Proposal Drafted</p>
<p>After reporting on various [unidentified] opinions, Mr. Xu further reported the telegram from Vice President Ye as follows: "Renji Hall, Lingnan Road, Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, this year's flood is deeply concerning. We are grateful for your invitation to assist with the association's affairs. We will do our best to work with our colleagues in the Central Committee to find solutions. In addition to drafting a proposal on party departments handling relief, we respectfully submit it in advance. I apologize for my temporary absence from tomorrow's meeting due to other matters. Chu Cang."</p>
<p>Appointing Directors and Standing Directors</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman reported to the standing committee the list of newly appointed directors and standing directors as follows: Standing Directors: Feng Yangshan, Hu Wenbao, Liu Zhanen, Wang Liming, Wu Daiyi, Cai Jinying, Yang [unidentified] Hao, Yan Zhenyu, Jin Mao Xueqin, Wang Xiaoying, Jin Guangmei, Lin Kecong, Xia Wu Wanfang, Li Qingxuan. Directors: Qin Zhigang, He Xiaohuan, Chen Gongzhe.</p>
<p>Allocation of Funds for Relief by Borrowing and Advance Payment</p>
<p>After the report, the discussion began. (1) A resolution was made to determine the method for investigating and releasing emergency relief to various provinces and to implement it earnestly and quickly. It was resolved to appoint the directors and deputy directors of the investigation [unidentified] group and Li Dachao, Lu Bohong, Huang Bodu, and others to consult on the method, and Director Wen was responsible for convening the meeting. (2) A resolution was made on how to allocate the borrowed and advanced relief funds, given the urgent need for relief in the disaster areas of various provinces.

(3) A resolution was made to appoint responsible personnel for the association's fundraising plan and to proceed quickly. The fundraising group was responsible for implementation, and the group temporarily operated in the yarn and cloth exchange. (4) A resolution was made to review and implement the association's detailed rules. The resolution was passed. (5) A resolution was made to strengthen the organization of each group and to have them be responsible for handling matters every day. The resolution was announced to each group. (6) A resolution was made to refer Baker's proposal to convene a joint meeting of Yellow River water conservancy engineers and relief personnel to discuss a unified approach to engineering and relief work to the design group for review and discussion. (7) A resolution was made to refer Su Zugui's letter proposing to add a broadcasting group to facilitate implementation to the propaganda group. (8) A resolution was made to refer Li Yingsheng's proposal to launch a campaign to donate goods for relief to the fundraising group.</p>
<p>Distributing Medicines in Disaster Areas</p>
<p>This year's floods have caused disasters everywhere. In addition to the deaths of more than 200,000 people, with corpses floating and sinking, which cannot be fully salvaged, the loss of houses and the submerging of fields, those climbing trees and rooftops, exposed to the scorching sun and steamed by the turbid currents, have led to widespread epidemics, spreading rapidly, and countless people have succumbed to illness and death. The Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Flood Relief in Various Provinces has distributed emergency medicines, including 2,000 bottles each of cholera medicine and cholera powder to Shandong Province, 400 packets each of Wan Jin You, Rendan, and Liang Dan, 2,000 packets of Wu Shi Cha, 1,600 bottles of five types of medicine in total, including Fo Dan, Jisheng Dan, Jiuji Dan, Lei Ji San, and Er Tian You, to Shandong Province; a total of 1,200 bottles of cholera medicine and dysentery powder to Hebei Province; A total of 800 packets of Wu Shi Cha, Ren Dan, and Liang Dan, A total of 1,000 bottles of six types of medicine to Hebei Province: Lei Ji San, Jiuji Dan, Wan Jin You, Fo Dan, Jisheng Dan, Er Tian You, a total of 1,000 bottles A total of 2,200 packets of cholera medicine, dysentery powder, Wu Shi Cha, Ren Dan, Liang Dan, Malaria Pills a total of three types of medicine to Henan Province: A total of 3,500 bottles six types of medicine of Wan Jin You, Er Tian You, Fo Dan, Lei Ji San, Jisheng Dan, dysentery powder to Henan Province: A total of 6,000packets of Wu Shi Cha, Malaria Pills Wan Jin You, Lei Ji San, a total of 800 bottles A total of 3,500 bottles of cholera medicine, dysentery powder, , A total of 5,200packets of Wu Shi Cha, Malaria Pills A total of 3,150 bottles of of Wan Jin You, Er Tian You, Fo Dan, Jisheng Dan, Ren Dan, Liang Dan, Lei Ji San,, 1,100 bottles of cholera medicine, Jisheng Dan, Malaria Pills to Hubei Province a A total of 7,000 bottles cholera medicine, 8,400 bottles Malaria Pills to outside party and government organizations and public charity organizations, A total of 1,000 packets Wu Shi Cha,, A total of 7,400 bottles Wan Jin You, Er Dan, Fo Dan, Jisheng Dan,人丹，良丹，雷擊散 to .

<h3 id="e87">Municipal Public Security Bureau Actively Engages in Anti-Smoking Campaign; Jointly Expands Public Awareness with Various Sectors; Registration of Persuasion Teams Nears Completion; Movie Theaters Add Anti-Smoking Slides <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been actively carrying out anti-smoking campaigns in the city. In order to eliminate smokers within a limited time, it has joined forces with various agencies and organizations to hold large-scale public awareness campaigns regularly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Door-to-Door Persuasion</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to investigate the number of smokers and persuade them to register for quitting smoking, has issued a circular to all branch bureaus and district offices, organizing persuasion teams to mobilize fully in mid-month to carry out persuasion. The harm of opium, its damage to the body, its economic costs, and the various theft behaviors of smokers are explained at any time, and smokers are kindly advised to register and quit. As a result, the number of smokers voluntarily registering has been more enthusiastic than before. This persuasion work will come to an end at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Expanding Public Awareness</p>
<p>The bureau, in order to limit and eliminate smokers and carry out widespread public awareness to achieve significant results in the anti-smoking effort, has specially collaborated with the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Citizens' Federation, the Women's Association, the Municipal Farmers' Association, and other agencies and organizations to hold expanded public awareness campaigns.

<h3 id="e88">First Special District Rent Reduction Meeting Yesterday Opened Fair Revival Rent Reduction Meeting; At the Same Time Held Rent Reduction Movement Week Opening Ceremony; Issued Declaration Demanding Landlords Voluntarily Reduce Rents <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Rent Reduction Committee held a Fair Revival Rent Reduction Movement Assembly at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and held the Rent Reduction Movement Week opening ceremony. More than 5,000 representatives from all walks of life and citizens attended. It was resolved to reorganize the rent reduction branches of various lanes and roads, take consistent action, and petition landlords to voluntarily reduce rents, etc. A declaration calling for rent reduction was also issued. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Opening Announcement</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, around 1:00 PM, representatives from all walks of life had been arriving at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Tibet Road. By 2:00 PM, the number of attendees had increased even more enthusiastically. By 3:00 PM, it was extremely crowded, with an estimated attendance of over 5,000 people. The meeting place was the auditorium on the second floor of the Ningbo Fellow Association. Above the door hung a white cloth banner that read "Shanghai First Special District Rent Reduction Committee Rent Reduction Movement Assembly." The image of Sun Yat-sen was hung high on the stage, with the flags of the party and the nation crossed on the left and right. Around the meeting place were pasted rent reduction slogans with sharp words and profound meanings. There were also Hua Cheng Public School Boy Scouts maintaining order. At exactly 2:00 PM, the bell rang to open the meeting. After the Hua Cheng Public School Boy Scouts held the opening ceremony, the presidium members Li Aokui, Wang Jingdong, Sun Wenyi, Chen Jiufeng, and Wang Hesong successively took their seats. The master of ceremonies was Zhu Zhichun, and the stenographer was Zheng Dongshan. After Li Aokui led everyone in performing the ceremonial rites, he began the report, passing resolutions, and ending with entertainment. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Jingdong of the presidium reported the purpose of the meeting, stating briefly: "Today is the first day of Rent Reduction Movement Week. Holding the Fair Revival Rent Reduction Movement Assembly here aims to make great efforts in public awareness, with the goal of awakening landlords to voluntarily reduce rents. The number of attendees today is very enthusiastic, which shows that people earnestly hope that rent reduction will be implemented as soon as possible." Then Li Aokui gave a speech, saying that the rent reduction movement in this city has been noisy for a year, but due to environmental factors, it has not achieved its goal. Now, all industries are depressed, and countless people are unemployed. Those who pay attention to society now see that the market is extremely serious. If we do not find a way to remedy it, I am afraid that it will not only be the bankruptcy of industry and commerce. Reducing rent is not a thorough solution to the social economy, but implementing it in Shanghai at present can be said to be an effective golden needle to adjust the social economy and ensure social order and security. Therefore, we are carrying out rent reduction movement work. Comrades, please take the purpose of common survival and common prosperity to strongly request the landlords to implement it.</p>
<p>Report on Work</p>
<p>Then Chen Jiufeng reported on the guidance process for attending various district branches, stating briefly: "Most of the rent reduction branches have been established in the entire district, but there are still many lanes and roads that have not been organized. We should jointly establish rent reduction associations and petition landlords to implement rent reduction, so as to adjust finance and revive the economy." Next, Zhang Xianfang reported, briefly stating, "The rent reduction movement has been going on for a year, but because it has not achieved a unified goal, we are holding Rent Reduction Movement Week to commemorate and encourage the progress of the work." Later, Luo Zheng, Zheng Dongshan, Zhou Fuzhang, Zhu Baoluo, Zheng Xiaolin, and others successively reported on rent reduction work, with the general meaning being that today's meeting aims to promote unified rent reduction, and also commemorate the success of part of the rent reduction movement over the past year. Therefore, after the committee's resolution, from today until the end of the month, it will be named Rent Reduction Movement Week and handled by the Propaganda Department. We rely on the public opinion circles and all walks of life to make consistent sympathetic claims, petition landlords, and think of the friendship of sharing the same boat, so that the expression of voluntary rent reduction can be achieved. The rent reduction committee has never had funds to cover expenses. This time, we need to print paper, distribute slogans and leaflets, and produce special publications, so we are distributing tickets at the entrance, collecting a small amount of printing paper fees, 20 cents per ticket, to show support. We do not donate money outside. This work is nothing more than a public movement. Rent reduction work requires the concerted efforts of everyone to maintain unity and a consistent spirit. Today's entertainment is not for eye-catching or hearing pleasure, but for the consistent promotion of rent reduction, which is closely related to our own interests and the important task of relieving our own burdens.</p>
<p>Passing Proposals</p>
<p>Yesterday's assembly passed the following proposals: (1) Resolving the problem of relieving the suffering of the people, and petitioning the landlords to reduce rents through common unity, the resolution was passed. (2) Requesting the party and government authorities to consult with the landlord associations to decide on rent reduction methods, the resolution was passed. (3) Sending a letter to the Public Works Department to re-evaluate the land price, so as to match the rent price, the resolution was passed. (4) All lanes and roads should uniformly form rent reduction branches, to emphasize unity, the resolution was passed. (A) Letters should be sent to the organizations of all sectors. (B) Organizations of branch associations must come to the meeting to register. (C) Already established branch associations must re-register to make the system clear. (5) Issuing a declaration calling for rent reduction, read by Sun Wenyi, the resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Calling for Rent Reduction</p>
<p>Yesterday, the assembly issued a declaration calling for rent reduction, which stated: "Even ants are greedy for life, who would want to die without clothes and freezing to death, or starving to death? Although it is not what they want, they have no choice. Being oppressed by rent and affecting food and clothing, resulting in death, is also a matter of no choice? Moreover, food and clothing can sometimes be reasonably self-controlled, but in the item of housing, there is no freedom to expand or contract. Rain, snow, wind, and frost are sheltered by houses, and cooking, washing, and drying cannot be done without houses. Especially the birth, old age, sickness, and death of family members, and personnel arrangements, none of which can do without houses. Among the 3.5 million residents of this city, excluding those who own their own houses and those who sleep on the streets, those who rent houses account for 80 or 90 percent. In recent years, the market has been declining and unemployment has been increasing. Most people have already moved from large houses to small houses, and from Tonglou Tongxiang to Tingzizao Pi or two- or three-story lofts. Who knows that the degree of recession is even worse than before? At this time of economic hardship, even living in the smallest house that cannot be shrunk is not enough to compensate for the rent price without saving clothes and reducing food. If even food and clothing are not enough, how can one live? Prostitution and theft are emerging one after another, and suicides are happening every day. The so-called prosperity of the market and the so-called maintenance of people's livelihood are truly nothing more than myths. Even the general price of goods has been declining one after another, but only the item of rent has not seen any change so far. Those who have responsibility are indifferent and those who can muddle through are all muddling through. It is not a misfortune that Shanghai, the only metropolis in our country, has such unfair things! The people of this association are deeply afraid that the collapse of the whole people will be even worse for the commercial market to go bankrupt without end. We should make preparations before it rains, and specially carry out the work of the Fair Revival and rent reduction movement, in order to seek remedy and stabilize society. I hope you will all see this. The Shanghai First Special District Fair Revival and Rent Reduction Movement Assembly."</p>
<p>Radio Broadcasting</p>
<p>Yesterday, each radio station broadcasted messages, requesting landlords to reduce rents. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency recorded the original text as follows: "In order to revive and prosper the Shanghai market, in order to consider the burden of tenants, we hope that real estate owners will reduce rents, not to take advantage of the situation. This is something that was publicized for a while last year, and was negotiated several times, but in the end it did not achieve the purpose we hoped for. A meaningful and reasonable thing suddenly stopped invisibly, and died out silently. On the tenant side, doubts arose and it was unclear why. On the real estate owner side, they thought it was a fantasy and a joke. In fact, this is very obvious. On the one hand, it is because the citizens still have a solid unity and self-improvement, and on the other hand, it is because the real estate owners still do not understand the reason why rent reduction is necessary, are ignorant of the times, and want to maintain face. Now we are repeating this rent reduction issue, and it must be done. There are three points that we should first declare: 1. This rent reduction association is a genuine organization of awakened citizen tenants, an automatic new organization of action, and is not a continuation of the old organization last year. 2. The reason why we want to establish this rent reduction association is entirely based on the will of all citizens, and is based on the general requirements of the factual environment. 3. The meaning of issuing this propaganda publication is that all Shanghai citizens, whether they are real estate owners or tenants, must understand that the purpose of our request for uniform rent reduction this time is not only for the sake of tenants, but also for the benefit of real estate owners. In short, it is for the entire social class of happiness. Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce, and also a place where culture and talent gather. If we can follow the principle of co-existence and co-prosperity in a rational and proper way, and achieve the goal of reducing rents, so that citizens can live and work in peace and contentment, and Shanghai society can have the opportunity to prosper and revive, that is what this association hopes for."</p>

The survey period is tentatively set for half a year and can be completed around May next year.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Secretary of the Siamese Ministry of Economy Secretly Arrived in Shanghai; Investigating the State of Sino-Siamese Trade; Trying to Alleviate the Anti-Siamese Rice Sentiment <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shin Shi News Agency, since our country's people advocated boycotting Siamese rice and helping overseas Chinese in Siam in order to awaken the Siamese government, there has been panic in the internal affairs of Siam. The Siamese government has repeatedly discussed countermeasures. In addition to slightly accommodating compulsory education and immigration, literacy tests, etc., it has also sent Nai Wijuet, secretary of the Ministry of Economy, to China for investigation. Nai was formerly the secretary of the Ministry of Education and was the most active person in cracking down on overseas Chinese education. His mission this time is to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the state of Sino-Siamese trade and our country's anti-Siamese rice situation, hoping to find ways to alleviate the sentiment. Nai set off from Siam at the beginning of last month and first went to Hong Kong and Guangdong to investigate. According to news from overseas Chinese organizations in this port, Nai arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, but his whereabouts are very secret. His attendant is Chinese lawyer Zeng Yaoyuan. Zeng grew up in Nanyang and studied in England. He is now a lawyer in Siam. He has lived in Siam for a long time and is extremely ignorant of the situation in his motherland. This time, he was invited by Nai Weile to come to China with him and plans to use Zeng's Chinese name to lobby the Chinese people on behalf of the Siamese government and promote propaganda for the Siamese government.</p>
<h3 id="e93">New Cotton Slightly on the Market; Excellent Quality, Prices Relatively Weak <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, in previous years, cotton samples were seen as early as before the half-month of the waste calendar in July. This year, due to the severe drought in early summer, the development of cotton buds was damaged, followed by continuous rain, resulting in late ripening of cotton in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. In addition, there was too much rain, which caused the cotton stalks to rise sharply, but the flowers were sparse, and the fruiting period was delayed. New cotton has only recently come on the market, more than ten days later than usual. Some of the arrivals include about 100 bales of Yuyao cotton. Hankou has also seen arrivals. According to observations by yarn factories, the quality of the new cotton is better than last year, but the price is quite weak, only about 31 to 32 yuan per unit.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Egg Exports Increased Sharply in July This Year; Ranked First Among Export Goods <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shin Shi News Agency, since my country's eggs and egg products have declined in exports in recent years due to various influences, exports suddenly increased in July this year. According to customs statistics, in July this year, the national exports of dried egg white were 1,191,958 yuan, dried egg yolk was 612,732 yuan, dried eggs not divided into yellow and white were 206,215 yuan, frozen wet egg white was 246,848 yuan, frozen wet egg yolk was 441,796 yuan, frozen wet egg products not divided into yellow and white were 2,134,401 yuan, fresh eggs were 375,959 yuan, preserved eggs were 13,956 yuan, totaling 5,223,785 yuan, which increased compared to the same period last year and in June, ranking first among export goods in July. From January to July this year, the national exports of eggs and egg products still decreased compared to the same period last year. Among them, dried egg white exports were 5,521,451 yuan, dried egg yolk was 1,976,878 yuan, eggs not divided into yellow and white were 660,920 yuan, frozen wet egg white was 644,926 yuan, frozen wet egg yolk was 1,661,967 yuan, frozen wet eggs not divided into yellow and white were 6,846,580 yuan.

<h3 id="e95">City Chamber of Commerce Explains the Starting Standard for Stamp Tax: Reference to Tax Rate for Exempt Portions Should Be Made <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce held a stamp tax lecture and the "Commercial Monthly" published a special issue on the new stamp tax law, businesses in this city have gained a clearer understanding of the new law. Those with questions have made written inquiries, which the Chamber has answered in detail. Yesterday, the Chamber issued a notice to its members to explain in detail the starting amounts for stamp duty on contracts, subletting contracts, stock loans or mortgage contracts, inheritance or property division contracts, etc., stating: "Regarding the 'Brief Explanation of Stamp Tax Law' published in the Chamber's 'Commercial Monthly,' Volume 15, No. 8, Special Issue on Stamp Tax Law, in Section 1 of the 'Yin' category, there are phrases in the 'Tax Rate Table' such as 'Exempt if under ten yuan, or exempt if under fifty yuan.' The tax should only be calculated and stamped according to the 'count as one hundred yuan' example after the amount reaches fifty yuan or ten yuan. In Section 2, where there are no phrases in the Tax Rate Table stating 'exempt if under a certain amount,' the tax should be calculated and stamped according to the 'count as one hundred yuan' example, even if the amount is as small as one yuan or five yuan. The original intention is that although Clauses 15, 16, 17, 19, and 21 of the Tax Rate Table specify a tax of two cents for every hundred yuan, if the amount exceeds the exemption standard of less than ten yuan or less than fifty yuan, it should be taxed according to the example of every hundred yuan, even if it is less than one hundred yuan. Section 2 refers to Clauses 18 and 20 of the Tax Rate Table, which have no minimum exemption limit. Therefore, even if the capital raising for business and the bonds are as small as five yuan or one yuan each, they should be taxed at three cents per hundred yuan. That is the meaning of the word 'also.' However, the Tax Rate Table states, 'For amounts exceeding, but less than one hundred yuan, it should also be counted as one hundred yuan.' Therefore, the phrase 'also count as one hundred yuan' in the 'Brief Explanation,' which originally referred to the minimum limit, has been mistakenly understood to refer to the exceeding amount. There is a discrepancy in meaning here. Therefore, we are re-analyzing this specifically and will remove the word 'also' from 'also count as one hundred yuan' in Sections 1 and 2 of the 'Yin' category of the 'Brief Explanation of Stamp Tax Law' that has not yet been issued, to avoid misunderstanding."</p>

<p>Since the Ningbo Industrial Bank temporarily suspended its acceptance and settlement, the local Ningbo community and third parties have strongly advocated for its restoration, and the call for resumption has spread across the country. A restoration movement was organized within the Ningbo Tongxiang Association. Since its establishment, the Association has made smooth progress. Creditors have been actively signing up for shares, reaching 70% of the total debt. The initiators of the Association believe that the time for action is ripe. A fourth initiators' meeting was convened at the Central Western Restaurant on Fourth Malu a few days ago. It was resolved that the Ningbo Industrial Bank Rehabilitation Preparation Office would be established from today onwards. All initiators of the rehabilitation movement will continue to serve as preparatory committee members. In addition, five standing preparatory committee members will be elected to actively handle the resumption and capital increase. Once the creditor share subscriptions are completed, the resumption can be scheduled. The simplified rules for increasing shares for the resumption have been established, and the responsible persons of the office will be responsible for fundraising. The date of resumption should not be far off.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Thirteenth Issue Aviation Lottery Winner <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Thirteenth Issue of the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery was drawn on August 9th. The first prize for this issue was sold by the retail department of the Dayun Company in this city, as has been reported in various newspapers. However, the names of the winners were difficult to ascertain at the time. Yesterday, the reporter specifically went to the Dayun Company to inquire. It was claimed that four winners had already entrusted Dayun Company to collect the prize money on their behalf, and all had been fully paid. It is said that a certain student Qu from a certain university in the west won one ticket. A Westerner named Carter won two tickets. A certain Lu from Jiangwan Town won one ticket. A certain student Zhao from Nei University won one ticket. It was reported that he did not go to the company to buy the ticket himself. A female classmate, who had gone out for an errand, passed by the Dayun Company on Avenue Edward VII and conveniently bought two tickets, one being No. 233781 and the other being No. 233790. After returning to school, she gifted No. 233781 to Qu, and said jokingly in the tone of an elder, "Here's 25,000 yuan for you to study hard abroad." Qu accepted it with a smile. Unexpectedly, it won the first prize. It is now heard that Qu will deposit the prize money in the bank under two names and will withdraw the money after graduating from university next year to study abroad together. This is truly a good story. Upon investigation, the first prizes of previous issues were mostly sold through Dayun Company. Sales in this issue were even more brisk due to the new rules. To date, Dayun Company has sold more than 2 million yuan, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total issued.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief, Cai Jingjun, noted that Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, with a dense population. Beggars soliciting along the streets not only detracted from the city's appearance, but also hindered traffic. Therefore, he instructed the branch chiefs and police station chiefs to order their officers to pay attention at all times to the prohibition. He also contacted charitable organizations to send male and female beggars to beggar reception centers, training institutes, and vagrant work-study centers for resettlement. It is reported that Huang Junfu, the branch chief of the 16th Sub-bureau, upon receiving the order, personally led patrol officers and police officers to inspect the wharves south of 16th Sub-bureau at approximately 2:00 AM yesterday. By 8:00 AM, more than fifty naked beggars were spotted. All were taken to the bureau for registration. At noon, these beggars were transported by vehicle to charitable organizations such as the Vagrant Work-Study Center for accommodation, in order to prevent them from wandering the streets and to improve the city's appearance.</p>

<p>The China Fuxin Tobacco Company believes that education is the foundation of the nation and industry is the source of national wealth. To make the country strong and prosperous, it is necessary to prioritize the popularization of education and the revitalization of industry. Therefore, in addition to making every effort to produce Golden Pagoda brand domestic cigarettes, the company has created the Golden Pagoda Scholarship to guide society and provide assistance to those who have lost their education. The method is to guess the time when Mr. Wang lost and found a pack of Golden Pagoda cigarettes. The answers are carefully sealed after verification and printing by Messrs. Shen Weiting, Zeng Xubai, Chen Yaozhu, Lu Shoulun, and Zhang Deqin, and stored in the Shanghai Bank. This is extremely fair and rigorous, and has been widely trusted by society.</p>
<p>The guessing game has been very popular. The game is simple. Even primary school students in the third and fourth grades can fill it out and participate. Therefore, there is an unprecedented number of participants. It is a rare and grand event.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM was the reveal of the answers. A special unveiling ceremony was held at the Shanghai Tobacco Industry Association. Representatives from all walks of life were invited to attend and the gentlemen who oversaw the sealing were invited to oversee. First, Mr. Ge Xiongfu, a representative of the company, took the answers from the vault of the Shanghai Bank and handed them to the overseeing gentlemen, who verified them without error and opened them publicly.</p>
<p>The time of loss was 3:48 AM on the 1st, and the time of finding was 1:22 AM on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Because there are many participants in this guessing game, it will take time to sort out the entries. The company is trying its best to organize them. It will likely be completed within a few days. Therefore, the results of the guessing game will be published in the Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Ta Wan Pao newspapers at the end of this month.</p>

<p>The splendor of the past. The variety show has gathered the most famous people in Shanghai, especially the Peking opera portion. Because they are the famous opera clubs in Shanghai, it is rare to see such famous actors casually outside. Therefore, the Peking opera stage has been sold out for days. Those who have participated in voluntary performances include the Lake Society Club, Hengshe Opera Club, Leshan Society Opera Club, Dacheng Drama Society, Zhengyi Society Club, Zhongshang Club, Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Staff Club, Datong Opera Club, Zhonghua Public Club, Commercial Club, and others. Famous actresses who participated in the performances include Xiao Qiaohong, Xuefei, Xihu Zhu, Xiao Baileng, Xiangping, Gao Yu, Meihualing, Linglong, Hua Chen Xiaolou, Shi Er Lou, and more than 160 people. Other performances such as Suzhou Tanci, Shanghai Opera, skits, Siming Civilization Opera, Chinese music, martial arts, and miscellaneous items are all the best of their time. According to the statistics of the Variety Show Committee, the number of people in the Variety Show involved in the past ten days totaled more than 2,000, and the number of visitors reached 20,000 to 30,000.</p>
<p>Seeking more brilliance. The event was originally scheduled to last for three weeks. The original plan, in addition to gathering variety shows from across the city to perform on stage daily, also included holding flower selection, star selection, and dance selection to attract attention. The flower selection part has already begun to be implemented, and the star selection is also being actively prepared. The dance selection will be held after the flower and star selections are established. In terms of Peking Opera, Dr. Mei Lanfang, who has returned from Europe, and the Performing Arts Association will be invited to perform. For other performances such as songs and dances and dramas, movie queens Hu Die, Xu Lai, and Li Minghui will be invited to perform on stage on scheduled days. The fourth floor inside will be opened as an open-air lounge, or open-air movies will be shown. It is heard that people have been asked to solicit film sources, and films showing the disaster situation are most suitable.</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Hunan and Henan. The Association previously solicited information on the disaster situation in various provinces, and paintings. Yesterday, the representatives from Hua County in Henan and the Hunan Fellow Association delivered more than 300 paintings depicting the disaster situation in various counties in Hunan, such as Xiangyin, Yuanling, Dayong, Hengyang, Xiangtan, Cili, and Shimen. The disaster situation and the number of people drowned, and the amount of property lost, etc., are displayed inside and outside the various venues, which is shocking to see, and spontaneously evokes a feeling of heaven and hell.</p>
<p>Today's Performances. Today's Peking Opera is performed by the Yageji Opera Club. The repertoire is as follows: Wang Xuezhen, Shen Binglong, and Wang Zhenming will jointly perform "Song Shi Hui."

People living in the world, regardless of their age, should be judged by the value of the undertakings they founded during their lives. Mr. Zheng, in the short span of 30 years, abandoned his wealthy family and devoted himself to social undertakings, achieving today's success. His value is great, needless to say. I hope that those who participate in the memorial service today will follow Mr. Zheng's spirit and continue Mr. Zheng's undertakings, then the memorial will not be in vain. Zhou Jianyun then reported on Zheng's life and deeds, followed by Ren Jinping, Guo Youshou, Zhang Zhengfan, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Dabei, Cai Chusheng, Zhang Shichuan, and others who gave speeches, full of sorrow.</p>
<p>Memorial Text. On the 25th day of the 8th month of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Association (omitting the names of thirty organizations) and others respectfully offer incense, flowers, and offerings to the spirit of Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, saying: Oh, shining Mr. Zheng, the hero of the mountains of Lingnan, you were intelligent as a child and elegant as you grew up. With a clear style and firm ambition, you were both accommodating and wise, excelling in the arts and literature. You were not only skilled in managing affairs, but also treated people with sincerity. You were humble and self-disciplined, never presumptuous. You instructed us with kindness and beauty, and many were guided by your achievements. In the late Qing Dynasty, the country was in turmoil, with officials indulging in comfort and the people in ignorance. We followed the old ways until the country was destroyed. Mr. Zheng, you were alarmed by this and filled with sorrow. You thought hard and strived tirelessly, seeking guidance from history, especially from the writings of Mencius, using subtle satire and pointed admonitions to influence the ruler. You spent a lot of money on drama, not caring about giving up your wealth, and presented yourself as an example, gaining great fame and awakening the people. The great dream was awakened, and the spirit of the people rose. The revolutionary tide surged, and Mr. Zheng's achievements were relied upon by the world. You also valued education, especially popular education. You overcame the difficulties of producing films, presenting a true picture of society and opening the minds of the people. Western films were booming, while we were just starting. Mr. Zheng was saddened by this and worked tirelessly, forgetting the past and future. We were counting on his great talent and looking forward to his continued efforts. Who would have thought that his hard work would suddenly lead to his death? The masses have lost their guide, and the country has lost its talent. We think that even a hundredfold effort could not repay his contribution, and tears flow endlessly. This is not just personal grief, but the weeping of the entire society. Alas, please accept this offering!</p>

<h3 id="e105">Robbery of Rice Merchants in the Downtown Area: Thieves Suddenly Appear in the Athletic Field: Male and Female Thieves Arrested <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>At 1:50 AM yesterday morning, the Central District Branch received a report from the foremen of the athletic field, Liu Gupei, Yao Yongsheng, and Chen Zhiping, that at around 12:00 AM, more than ten robbers suddenly appeared in the athletic field. Several robbers wielded sharp knives and threatened them into silence, robbing six bags of rice stored in the field. After receiving the report, Branch Chief Huang Qiguang immediately ordered the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the Detective Squad, Wu Kezhong and Chu Jingwu, to lead detectives Lu Liuqing and Li Bingsen, along with patrol officers, to investigate. Zhang Desheng was arrested at No. 1 Jin Xujiazhai, and five measures of rice were seized. Five measures were seized at the home of Xue Mazi, but Xue Mazi had already escaped. Two pecks of rice and Western-style clothing were seized at the home of Jiang Fangshi at No. 4. The suspects and stolen goods were taken to the station. According to Zhang Guirong, an officer, Zhang Desheng confessed that he and a certain Hu Xingchang had obtained five pecks of rice and were preparing to divide it the next day. Jiang Fangshi confessed that her husband, Jiang Jiafa, had returned to his hometown in Anhui half a month ago. The rice was taken from the athletic field by her lover Min Guo, Chen Sanmazi, Jiang Jiafa, Zhou Rihe, Zhang Desheng, Hu Xingchang, Xue Mazi, and a certain Zhu. A suspect named Liu Huan claimed that he had gone out to urinate and was arrested. He said he did not know about the rice robbery. After verifying the confessions, the interrogating officer sent detectives Lu Liuqing and Li Bingsen to investigate. According to nearby residents, they knew that the thieves were behaving improperly, so they refused to rent them houses. Unexpectedly, Xu Boquan, the landlord of No. 4, rented a house to the thieves. The two detectives reported the situation. The Detective Squad found that Xue Yushan (aka Xue Mazi) was from Shandong. In July of last year, he had conspired to rob the San Mori Construction Factory on Hongqiao Road. The robbery was solved by Caojiadu Branch Detective Squad Chief (aka Wu Kezhong), and the robbers, including Li Weiyuan, were sent to court and sentenced to seven years in prison, while Xue Mazi was at large. Officer Zhang determined that Zhang Desheng had admitted to robbing rice with Hu Changxing, and Jiang Fangshi had testified that Zhang Desheng and Hu Changxing were involved, confirming the conspiracy to rob. As the main suspect, Xue Mazi, and others were at large, in addition to arresting the accomplices to investigate, the case was reported to the Public Security Bureau for disposition.</p>

<p>According to the Datong News Agency, after the Huafeng Xingji Flour Mill on Xiaoshadu Road was closed, the workers had not been dismissed. On the morning of the 24th, the workers elected 36 representatives, including Wang Renkuan and Jiang Kaiyang, to lead more than 100 male and female workers to the home of Ye Shantao, a director of the factory, at No. 47, Zunde Lane (i.e., Lane 136) on Xiamen Road, to request a meeting with Ye and to put forward three demands: (1) payment of three months' severance pay; (2) payment of five months' salary, as the factory has been closed for five months; and (3) resumption of factory operations. As the demands had not been met, the workers refused to leave. The Laozha Police Station dispatched more than a dozen Chinese and foreign police officers to suppress the situation day and night. It is also reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has negotiated with the factory and will send personnel at 2:00 PM today to pay one month's severance pay in advance.

<h3 id="e107">Absurd Report of Drowning, Seduction, Rape and Murder Failed, Wu Langqing Deceives Friend, Losing Morality, Cai Yongqing Returns from the Dead <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Cai Fusheng, currently running the Sanyang Native Products Store in Qingdao, is 50 years old and a native of Ningbo. His wife, Zhu, is 52 years old. They have two sons, the elder named Zhenmiao and the younger named Yongqing, who is 29 years old and works as a cook on the Changxing steamship of the Sanbei Shipping Company. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Yongqing, through an introduction, married a woman surnamed Qi, named Xiaomao (28 years old this year), in Shanghai. After Qi married into the family, she lived with Yongqing at No. 4 Yong'an Lane, Chenxiangge Street, inside the Old North Gate of Shanghai City. In June of this year, Yongqing set off from Shanghai to Qingdao to borrow money from his father, Cai Fusheng, for use. At that time, Fusheng's wife, Zhu, because her son Yongqing had not returned home for a long time, and it was the height of summer with extremely hot weather, stayed at the store to avoid the summer heat before returning to Shanghai. At that time, Yongqing, unable to disobey his mother's wishes, agreed to stay in Qingdao. However, he had not notified his wife through a letter. Unexpectedly, Wu Langqing, a fellow villager of Cai, 25 years old, who originally had a good friendship with Yongqing and lived in the same place, but was not yet married, saw that Qi was quite attractive and had long plotted to have an illicit relationship, but had no opportunity. Wu, taking advantage of Yongqing's departure to Shanghai, lied to Qi, saying that Yongqing, due to the family's financial difficulties, deliberately went to Qingdao to borrow money as an excuse and had already taken a boat and committed suicide by drowning. The news was accurate, and so on. Qi suddenly heard Wu's words and thought to herself that her husband Yongqing had been away for a long time and there was no news, so she believed it to be true. She cried out in despair. After Wu persuaded her in many ways, she set up a spirit tablet at home to offer sacrifices and invited monks and Taoists to chant scriptures to save the soul of the deceased. Thereupon, Wu took the opportunity to seduce Qi, who was young and weak-willed, and she fell into his trap and became involved with him. When Yongqing's elder brother heard about it, he wrote a letter to Qingdao to inquire with his parents about the truth. Yongqing saw the letter and was greatly shocked. He quickly said goodbye to his parents and rushed back to Shanghai on the 22nd of the month. Just as he was about to return home, his neighbors, fearing that something unfavorable would happen to him, advised him not to return home to avoid danger. Yongqing had no choice but to return to the Changxing ship, intending to find a way to deal with it. Unexpectedly, Wu Langqing had already found out about it and used a preemptive strike. He secretly hid a sharp knife and boarded the Changxing ship on the previous evening at around 10 PM, intending to murder Yongqing. However, his plan was not well-kept and was heard by Yongqing's cousin, named Zhu Zhongxing, who quickly told Yongqing all the news and secretly discussed a method of arresting him. They agreed to wait together by the side of the 16th pier, No. 10 on the Bund in Nanshi. Before long, they saw Wu shuffling along. They managed to step forward and grab him, and called the watchman police officer Song Xigui from the 39th post of that place. They found a sharp small knife on Wu Langqing's body and took him to the 16th Sub-bureau. When the head of the Huang sub-bureau pre-tried the case, the plaintiff complained about the previous situation and requested a strict investigation. When questioned, the defendant Wu Langqing's confession was evasive. Because the case was important, he was ordered to prepare a document to be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Fire Broke Out Again in Yangjia Ferry, Pudong, Still in the North Caonitang Area, Burning Down Fifteen or Sixteen Straw Sheds <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>In Yangjia Ferry, Pudong, on the west end of Heng Street, north of North Caonitang, there were many straw sheds. Yesterday, at 1:40 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in the shed where Guo Quanming from Hebei and Zhang Er from Tongzhou lived. They were unable to put it out, and the flames immediately broke through the roof of the shed and spread outwards. The head of the Yangjia Ferry Police Station, Yang Zhongquan, heard the alarm and quickly telegraphed to various fire departments for assistance. Meanwhile, in light of the severe fire in North Caonitang the previous time, he dispatched many more police officers to the fire scene to maintain order and assist. Soon, the director of the Pudong District Fire Brigade, Zhao Longsheng, led his staff to drive to the scene to provide assistance. After a while, fire trucks from Laobaidu and other places also arrived to help. However, at that time, the weather was hot and the straw sheds were extremely dry, so pouring a large amount of water had no effect. The fire burned more and more fiercely. Seeing that the situation was not good, the firefighters quickly joined forces to tear down the straw sheds around the fire and isolate them from the flames, which finally had a great effect. The fire could no longer spread, and its momentum weakened. The firefighters continued to do their best to extinguish the fire. At around 4 PM, the fire was completely extinguished. A total of fifteen or sixteen straw sheds were burned down and more than twenty were demolished. Afterwards, Director Yang ordered the two households where the fire started, Guo Quanming and Zhang Er, to be taken to the station for investigation into the cause of the fire. However, Guo pointed to Zhang, saying that the fire was started by frying beans, while Zhang pointed to Guo, saying that the fire was started by smoking opium. They passed the buck to each other. The director prepared a document and submitted it to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Yangjia Ferry Police Station Requests Construction of Civilian Housing to Accommodate Caonitang Fire Victims; General Bureau Submits to Municipal Government for Approval <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>A major fire broke out in North Caonitang, Yangjia Ferry, Pudong, at around 8 PM on July 29th of this year, burning down more than 700 straw sheds, with approximately 2,800 victims, men, women, and children. The details were previously reported. It is now learned that Yang Zhongquan, the head of the Yangjia Ferry Police Station, under whose jurisdiction the area falls, noted that in recent years, there have been four major fires in the north and south Caonitang areas. Most of the victims are coolies and workers from Jiangbei, a very large slum in this city. If strict measures are taken, these people will inevitably cause trouble unreasonably. If they are not prevented, they will rebuild on the same site after the disaster, without any fear. This situation is not a fundamental solution. Therefore, he recently suggested to the General Bureau that, referring to the plan to rebuild civilian housing on Qimei Road and other places in this city, he requested the Municipal Government to order the Civilian Welfare Committee to rebuild all the straw sheds in the north and south Caonitang areas into civilian housing. Although the land belongs to the Sand Industry Association, a method of renting land to build houses can be agreed upon with the association, and it can be used. It is heard that this proposal has been approved by the Bureau Affairs Meeting and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. The local Party headquarters and various public organizations, believing that this move is related to civilian welfare, have also risen up to support it, striving to achieve the goal.</p>

At 10 AM yesterday, his son-in-law, Zhu Jianben, borrowed 300 yuan from the Railway Bureau as funeral expenses. The coffin was received at 2 PM. In addition to the pension and savings, the Railway Bureau also offered generous compensation of half a year's salary to show its condolences.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Zhou Shifa Sued by Cousin for Seizing Ancestral Fortune Worth 600,000 Gold; Shifa Denies Ancestral Property <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Shifa, a compradore for the De Fu Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road and a native of Shaoxing, is a cousin of Zhou Shizhen. Shifa is in his forties and is the elder brother, while Shizhen is only 25 years old and is the younger brother. In recent years, Shizhen has been living in Wuzhong, teaching at Minsheng Elementary School, earning only a little over ten yuan a month. His standard of living is worlds apart from that of his elder brother. When Shizhen's father passed away a few years ago, the family was very poor and could barely afford the funeral. Shizhen once begged his brother for help, appealing to their kinship, but Shifa only gave him fifty yuan. From then on, the cousins drifted apart and became like strangers. Recently, Shizhen, seeing that his brother possessed a huge fortune, all of which was inherited from their ancestors and belonged to the same lineage, believed that the inheritance should be divided equally. Therefore, he hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to file a lawsuit against Shifa in the First Special District Local Court to divide the property. He claimed that their ancestor Yunpu had four sons: Meng Peijun was the father of the defendant Shifa; Zhong Peidong had no children; Uncle Peizeng had one son, who disappeared early; and Ji Peilin was his father, who had two sons, one of whom also disappeared, and the other was him. His father and uncles had all passed away one after another. The ancestral property had never been divided, amounting to 600,000 yuan. It is now learned that the defendant has seized it all. He had previously requested the court to mediate, but the defendant refused, so he filed a lawsuit, requesting that the entire inheritance be handed over and divided according to law. Yesterday, Judge Ni opened the court and summoned both parties for interrogation. The plaintiff Zhou Shizhen testified that his father died in July of the 15th year of the Republic. His family also has two sisters: the elder, Xiujuan, is 22 years old, and the younger, Cangzhen, is only 18 years old. Before his father died, he told me that the ancestor had an inheritance of over 600,000 yuan, which had not been divided. Because the defendant's father was favored by his parents, he was in charge of managing the family property, and it was seized. When questioned, the defendant Zhou Shifa testified that when his father died, he was only eight years old. He was raised by his maternal uncle and then entered the De Fu Foreign Firm to work. His current property was earned by himself and there was no ancestral property. The court stated that further investigation was needed and ordered the hearing to be adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Muttering Incantations, Sealing Banknotes in a Can, 200 Yuan Vanished, Apprentice Realized He Had Been Fooled – Old Case from a Year Ago Finally Solved <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Wang Weishan, a Zhenjiang native who uses playing cards to commit fraud, has been living on the sea, relying on it for many years. On June 12th of last year, Jin Fuyuan, an 18-year-old apprentice from Shangyu at the Kaishan Brick and Tile Company on Jiujiang Road, was ordered to go to the Wu Feng Qian Zhuang on Ningbo Road to collect 200 yuan in banknotes and bring them back to the company. When passing by Lane 498 on North Suzhou Road, Wang was there showing off his skills with two pages of playing cards, attracting onlookers. Jin stopped to watch, and they seemed to recognize each other. Wang, thinking that Jin was easy to deceive, said that he could not only teach this kind of magic trick, but also turn Jin's money into twice the amount. Jin was intrigued and asked for advice. Wang waited for the onlookers to disperse and then took out a tin can, ordering Jin to put all the 200 yuan banknotes into the can. He sealed the lid with red paper and smeared paste on the paper. While smearing, he muttered incantations, saying that he was drawing a talisman and reciting a spell. Then he handed the can to Jin to take home, firmly instructing him not to open it on the way. Jin returned to the company, thinking that he would unexpectedly get a windfall. He eagerly opened the lid and saw that the banknotes had turned into shredded newspaper, with a note attached, containing threats, roughly saying that heavenly secrets must not be revealed. If anyone asked him about the money, he should say that he encountered a thief on the way and was robbed of everything. The money would be returned after forty-nine days, otherwise he would be struck by lightning. At the end, it was written "Meet in the air." Jin then realized that he had been fooled and quickly told the company manager, who reported it to the police for investigation. After more than a year, they had no leads. Until recently, Jin happened to be walking at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road, and they unexpectedly met. He called the police and had him arrested by the Huishi Police Station. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. Wang Dashan confessed that he and an accomplice surnamed Ruan, who was still at large, had indeed defrauded Jin of money that day, and claimed that the banknotes in the can were replaced with newspaper when he shook the can up and down around the plaintiff. But the amount was only 162 yuan, and he got 47 yuan. The court ordered him to be detained and the hearing adjourned.</p>

<p>On the morning of June 4th of this year, at around 11 AM, three robbers broke into the Fourth Branch of the Shanghai Xinhua Savings Bank at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Hualong Road in the French Concession and robbed more than 4,700 yuan in cash. The robbers fled with the loot. When passing by Hehe Lane, they resisted arrest and shot and killed a pedestrian, a maidservant from Yangzhou named Wang Ma. They fled to the intersection of Chongqing Road in the Public Concession and shot and killed another male pedestrian. As a result, the robbers fled into Ma'an Lane and were caught on the rooftop of the kitchen at No. 28 in the lane. One of the robbers, a young man from Anhui named Wang Zhiting, was arrested, and a pistol was seized. He was taken back by the French police. It was found that the pistol belonged to Zhu Boyan (a native of Ningbo), a clerk at the Penghua Bank residing at No. 31 Continental Lane, Luban Road, which was already closed. Zhu was arrested along with Wang and sent to the Second Special Court. The case was prosecuted against Wang and Zhu for robbery, murder, and violation of the Regulations for the Suppression of Military Firearms. At the end of the trial, Wang Zhiting was sentenced to eight years in prison for robbery, but was found not guilty of murder. Zhu Boyan was fined 300 yuan for illegally possessing a pistol. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the robber Wang Zhiting expressed dissatisfaction with the original trial verdict and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court while in custody. The Higher Court, based on the petition, summoned witnesses the day before yesterday morning. President Liang Renjie, together with judges Sun Honglin and Wang Yue, specially opened the Third Court to interrogate them. The Police Department sent lawyer Yuan Jiahuang to court. The court first ordered the appellant Wang Zhiting to be brought to court and asked him about the reasons for his appeal against the original judgment. The defendant overturned the testimony from the original trial and tried to shift the blame to Zhang Zifa and others who were still at large, in an attempt to exonerate himself. The court then summoned witnesses and investigating detectives from the police station for questioning and ordered them to await a retrial on a set date. The appellant was returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>

<p>At 10 PM on August 24th, the Hengda Trough Store at No. 137 Huiji Lane, Route Tenant de Bihain, was robbed. At that time, the store had not yet closed. The store owner, Zhang Songfen, was out, and only the partner, Zhu Chunrong, was in the store. Suddenly, three robbers came, all wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers. They entered the store under the pretext of buying cigarettes, speaking with a Jiangbei accent. They took out a pistol and warned him not to make a sound, robbing six yuan in banknotes, one yuan in silver dollars, and fifty-six cents in small silver coins. Two robbers fled east, and one robber walked out of the lane and hired a rickshaw on Route Tenant de Bihain. At this time, the store partner, Zhu Chunrong, frantically shouted "Robber" from behind. Police Officer Wang Shouchang from Post No. 29 nearby stepped forward and apprehended the robber, seizing all the stolen money. He took him to the Zhoujiaqiao Sub-station and then transferred him to the Caojiadu Bureau. After interrogation, the robber confessed his name as Zhao Weiyi, living near Zhongshan Bridge, and that he, along with Chang Si and Chen Yuqiu, robbed the Hengda Trough Store. The gun was fake and was taken by Chang Si. They agreed to split the loot at his house. Chang Si lives in Hongkou, etc. The police immediately dispatched officers to the robber's home to arrest two suspects, Gao Shanshu and Zhao Xu.

<p>At the corner of Jing'an Temple and Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai, the former site of St. George's, new-style urban housing is currently under construction and will soon be completed. It is being leased by the real estate department of the Xinhua Trust and Savings Bank on Jiangxi Road. It is reported that the urban housing was designed by famous architects and is extremely suitable for opening various shops. It is also located in a strategic area in western Shanghai, the center of all high-end residential areas in the city. Therefore, many people have been contacting the bank to inquire about renting the housing. It is also heard that the bank, in view of the economic downturn, has specially negotiated with the owners to offer preferential treatment, reducing the originally set rent by a considerable amount. Anyone who rents from the bank before the urban housing is completed will enjoy this preferential treatment. This is also good news in the midst of the economic downturn.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Chinese Institute of Engineers Awards Honorary Gold Medal to Hou Debang for His Diligent Efforts in Alkali Production <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>(Nanning Correspondence) The Chinese Institute of Engineers passed a resolution at its board meeting on June 24th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China that any citizen of our country who has made special contributions to engineering shall be awarded an honorary gold medal to commend their achievements. Recently, a proposal from ten members, including Gu Yuxiu, and the approval of the review committee, decided to award the first honorary gold medal at the annual meeting to Dr. Hou Debang, Chief Engineer of Yongli Chemical Industries in Tianjin. The awarding ceremony took place at 2:00 PM on the 13th of this month in the Guilin Grand Auditorium.</p>
<p>Hou, whose courtesy name is Zhiben, is from Minhou, Fujian. In the first year of the Republic of China, he graduated from Tsinghua School and was sent to the United States at the school's expense. He entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to specialize in chemical engineering, where he excelled. After obtaining his bachelor's degree in the sixth year of the Republic of China, he immediately interned in a chemical factory. Later, he entered Columbia University to continue his studies and obtained his master's degree in the eighth year of the Republic of China and his doctorate in philosophy in the tenth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>At that time, the Yongli Alkali Plant in Tanggu, Tianjin, was established, and Hou was hired as the chief engineer. Alkali is fundamental to the chemical industry, but foreign manufacturers kept the manufacturing methods absolutely secret, making it impossible to learn. After Hou was appointed in the United States, he immediately began designing, and after more than a year, he succeeded. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, a Western mechanical engineer returned to China to install the machinery. After another year, the Yongli Alkali Plant began production. However, due to the vastness of the project and the constant difficulties, and with no specialized books for reference or experts to consult, all difficulties had to be solved by Hou himself. He devoted himself to research, and after more than a year, he achieved mass production, and Yongli became the earliest Solvay process alkali plant in East Asia. Currently, it produces 100 tons of soda ash per day, and it is expected to increase to 150 tons after autumn. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, Dr. Hou traveled to the United States for a second inspection. Recognizing the lack of reference books and materials on alkali production, he compiled his experiences into a special collection and published it to the world. It was published by the American Chemical Society as one of its series and was highly praised by experts from Western countries as a great work. In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, he returned to China from the United States and added a caustic soda manufacturing department to the alkali plant. Later, he expanded the machinery factory and foundry. Now, all the newly added mechanical equipment in the Yongli Alkali Plant, whether large or small, precise or simple, can be manufactured in-house, making it a model for domestic factories. After the Yongli alkali production business had established a solid foundation, Hou devoted his remaining efforts to new ventures. At the beginning of the twenty-third year, Yongli Alkali Company was reorganized into Yongli Chemical Industries, adding an ammonium sulfate manufacturing department. The plant site is located in Puzhen, with a capital of seven million yuan. All engineering aspects are under Hou's direction. He traveled to the United States again in the spring to negotiate all equipment procurement matters and supervise the manufacturing of various equipment. Currently, all the machinery has been shipped to China in succession, and Dr. Hou will also return to China this autumn. It is expected that the ammonium sulfate plant will begin shipping goods next autumn.</p>
<p>Since Hou began serving at Yongli Company for alkali production, he has experienced countless difficulties and hardships over the past fifteen years. However, Hou, relying on his knowledge and experience, worked diligently and persevered until he succeeded. His perseverance and spirit are truly admirable. Moreover, Hou excels in both academics and business, not only laying the foundation for chemical engineering in our country but also having his specialized writings admired both at home and abroad, making him a glory of our country's engineering and academic circles. Now, the Chinese Institute of Engineers is awarding him an honorary gold medal, not only to express its admiration for Hou but also to hope that more Chinese people will follow Hou's example and strive for engineering academics and engineering construction.</p>

Currently, labor education in Shanghai and Wuxi is being promoted by the committee members (Pan Gongzhan in Shanghai and Gao Jian'si in Wuxi), and progress has been greater than last year. It is reported that the second step in the two ministries' plan for this year was originally to continue establishing labor education experimental zones in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou. However, due to the floods in Hankou, it is necessary to suspend the plan, and only Tianjin and Qingdao can be established. Currently, the Ministries of Industry and Education are jointly drafting letters to the administrative authorities of Tianjin and Qingdao to first investigate the actual situation in each location, and after receiving a response, they will plan to establish the two labor education experimental zones.</p>

<p>Dr. Shou Yicheng, an economics expert, served in an important banking position in Hangzhou for four years and achieved considerable success. He offered many suggestions to the working youth of Hangzhou. Yesterday, he published an article entitled "Farewell to the Working Youth of Hangzhou," which included eight key points: (1) Maintain vitality with an optimistic attitude; (2) Overcome the environment with a strong will; (3) Create career opportunities with a professional spirit; (4) Develop a healthy character with a straightforward demeanor; (5) Cultivate economic independence by advocating thrift; (6) Expand knowledge through continuous research; (7) Unleash inner potential by making good use of strengths; (8) Realize career plans with thorough preparation. He also said that the motivation of any promising young person engaged in any industry must be extremely pure, their direction must be extremely lofty, and their actions and steps must be extremely firm and practical. The above-mentioned points are all cultivation efforts that we must go through to seek this, and the key to success lies precisely in this. Experts in factory management have said that apprentices are the most important basic component in an industrial organization, and the success or failure of a business can be seen in the success or failure of apprentice training. Therefore, our young comrades, no matter what industry they are engaged in or what position they hold, should have the conviction of not belittling themselves and doing their best. If I am absent, not only will a basic member be lost in this business, but also an important driving force will be lost in the national movement to revitalize the Chinese nation and promote economic construction. Therefore, each should work diligently and strive for progress in their respective positions, and I need not worry that they will have no way to serve. I am incompetent, but I have always encouraged myself to be a youth-oriented employee, and I often express my heartfelt feelings in the hope of encouraging each other. I hope to inspire others by offering my humble opinions, especially at this moment of reluctant farewell.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Little Boy (20) (6) <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott of America, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Once, when his grandmother was invited to dinner, he put cobblestones in the sugar bowl - the poor old lady wondered why they wouldn't dissolve in her tea, but she was so well-mannered that she didn't say anything. Once in church he passed a snuff bottle all the way down the aisle, so five boys sneezed so badly they had to leave in a hurry. In winter he dug a little path in the snow, then secretly poured cold water on it, and soon people were falling all over the place. He almost drove poor Mr. Rice crazy because he hung Mr. Rice's big boots in a conspicuous place, and Mr. Rice's feet were enormous, which was exactly what he didn't want people to know. He advised the good little Daoli to tie a thread to his loose tooth and let one end of the thread dangle outside his mouth when he fell asleep so that Tao Mo could pull it out for him without feeling the pain of the operation. However, the tooth didn't fall out when it was pulled the first time, and poor Daoli woke up in pain and never trusted Tao Mo from that day on. The last prank was to deliberately soak bread in wine and feed it to the hens, making them dizzy and staggering, while other poultry ran away at the sight, because those usually dignified old hens were suddenly stumbling and staggering, pecking and crowing. The whole family laughed so hard at these strange appearances until little Mei pitied them and locked them in the chicken coop to sleep off their drunkenness.</p>
<p>These were the boys here, and they lived together very happily, studying, playing, working, arguing, overcoming mistakes, and cultivating virtues together. The children of other schools may have more book knowledge, but when it comes to the understanding or insight that makes people good, I'm afraid they are not as good as here. Words and mathematics are certainly very good, but in Professor Pei Er's opinion, self-awareness, self-help, and self-control are even more important, and he did teach them these things very carefully. Others sometimes shook their heads when talking about his ideas, even though they admitted that the children had made extraordinary progress in their behavior and manners. But we should naturally know, as Mrs. Shu said to Ned, this is a "strange school."</p>

<h3 id="e140">Zhejiang Provincial Games Athletes Final General Test Complete Centralized Training Finished Men's Javelin Results Excellent <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province's athletes attending the National Games held their final general test at the Provincial Sports Field at 2:30 p.m. on the 24th. There was considerable progress in various track and field results compared to the previous test. Among them, the men's javelin broke the provincial record for this year by more than two meters, which is a particularly valuable achievement. Except for football, which will be played against a mixed team this Tuesday, the basketball game was played against the Hangzhou Flying Horse team the day before yesterday. The training of all athletes has come to an end. However, there were very few athletes who asked for leave or were absent from this test, and the number of participants in the test was minimal, which inevitably reduced the interest. Finally, the national art athletes performed, and the results were completed at 6:00 p.m. as follows:</p>
<p>Women's 50 meters (1) Zheng (2) Hua He Min 7.5 seconds</p>
<p>Men's 3000 meters (1) Ting Yang 11 minutes 6.9 seconds</p>

<p>— (Yinhu)</p>
<p>We see a person who does a good job in a career must go through decades of experience to develop. The reason for this development must come from accumulated experience and long-term practice. Now politicians are often transferred every few months. It is of course difficult to harvest good results.</p>
<p>Human feelings are as thin as autumn clouds. This is a sentence to describe the fickleness of the world; in fact, human feelings must be much thinner than autumn clouds.</p>
<p>Now people's feelings are the most unpredictable. The clouds in summer change more than the clouds at any other time. Human feelings are as illusory as summer clouds. But it is a very good metaphor.</p>
<p>Now, no matter what you do, you have to talk about qualifications. In fact, people with qualifications do not necessarily have talents, and people with talents, if they do not have experience; the things they do still have to wait until they have experience before they can do well.</p>

<p>— Tiansheweng</p>
<p>This was probably in the summer of a certain year. At this time, I and a few friends were taking refuge from the heat in the ×× Academy outside Beiguo, reading books and playing chess in the painting room. At night, a few friends rowed a small boat and rippled in the lake. I only saw high mountains and small moons, and countless stars dotted the lake. The clear breeze was gentle and the coolness was pleasant. There were friends who played the flute and sang loudly. This scene and this feeling are still vivid in my mind. Where can I get it back now!</p>
<p>I remember one evening, the new rain had just cleared, and the mountain colors were like a beauty after bathing. There were especially many people catching fish and shrimp by the lake. We also took fishing rods and fished under Shiguting. Suddenly, I saw a young man in a large-sleeved cloth coat, holding an umbrella in his hand, walking slowly across the bridge. After passing Shiguting, he went straight to Pujisi Temple. It turned out that the academy where we were taking refuge from the heat was next to Pujisi Temple. There was a monk in the temple who could write a few poems, write in the style of Wang Xizhi, and understood some Shaolin boxing. He often came to chat with us. At this time, we saw the young man walking into the temple and couldn't help but feel a little rare.</p>
<p>Later, through the monk's introduction, we learned that the young man's surname was Mu, his name was Yaoshu, and he called himself Mulang. He was a high-achieving student at Shanghai Nanyang Public School. We expressed our admiration to him, and he stammered and seemed awkward in speech. He had a very solid foundation in Chinese studies, and his English was also excellent. He could also perform a few sets of Neijiaquan. But his appearance was very simple and mature for his age, and he seemed a bit like a country bumpkin. Who knew he was a university student?</p>
<p>The summer vacation was over, and we all went to school. We said goodbye to Mulang for a few months and didn't meet each other. However, we often had letters back and forth. The year after we graduated, we received Mulang's wedding invitation. We invited a few friends to his house for a wedding feast. At this time, the congratulatory guests filled the door. There were students in suits, bald monks, and remnants of the imperial examination era. The scene was bizarre and very interesting. In our hometown custom, on the night of the wedding, the bride and groom sit side by side and drink with the congratulatory guests, which is called "Helang." Mulang had a whimsical idea and actually pulled a few monks to贺郞, and made "Monks贺郞" the topic of the drinking game, forcing the congratulatory guests to write a poem and the bride to pour the wine. This can be called a unique贺郞. The now famous Taixu Monk was one of the 贺 guests at the time.</p>
<p>A few years later, one day, I accidentally read a newspaper and suddenly saw the news that Mulang had been shot by a warlord in Sichuan. I was really shocked. It turned out that after graduating from Nanyang Public School, Mulang had worked as the principal of a girls' school in Chengdu. According to the accusations announced by a certain warlord, Mulang and a certain female student committed adultery in the classroom during the day. Therefore, he was shot alive.</p>
<p>This was probably ten years ago? I still think about him now!</p>

<p>According to a friend, "Small pebbles were not very useful in the past. Since the popularity of cement buildings, small pebbles have become necessities." Therefore, his early stone mountain, which was equivalent to waste, is now actually willing to pay a high price to sign a contract and organize a large-scale stone mining company to make profits from it. This may be something he never dreamed of?</p>
<p>One day, a friend very sincerely told me an anecdote about small pebbles in his childhood. He said, "In my youth, because I couldn't hold back the flames of youth, I was looking for a partner everywhere. After a few months, I fell in sweet love with Na, but Na's family was very stubborn and did not allow me to cross the Min gate. As the saying goes, the more severe the oppression, the stronger the reactionary explosion. One day I was wandering under the window of her back building, no, I was wandering more than once. This day can be regarded as a lucky day. I was looking up at the window when suddenly, with a 'ya' sound, the window opened. Seeing the opportunity, I immediately took out the love letter I had written in advance and hidden in my pocket and wanted to pass it to her. She put down a silk thread and hung the letter up. After that, as long as I picked up a small pebble on the ground and threw it at the tile, she would open the window. In this way, after a year of back and forth, the two achieved the purpose of marriage by all means. At that time, a friend sent a pair of wedding couplets with the embedded sentence 'stone marriage'."</p>
<p>Now he often praises the pebbles in front of his friends as his heroes. Four words can represent the completion of the marriage. "Throwing a brick to attract jade." His wife's name has the word "jade."</p>

<h3 id="e150">High-Interest Loans <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>My friend has a neighbor who makes a living by lending money at high interest rates. There are three types of lending he does. The first type is loans above ten yuan (usually up to twenty yuan), with an interest rate of one dime per yuan per month. When borrowing, for a ten-yuan loan, only nine yuan is given, deducting one month's interest in advance, but the IOU must be written for twenty yuan in order to avoid losses in principal and interest in case of litigation. The second type is loans around five yuan, starting with a booklet, collecting one yuan per month including principal and interest. After collecting for ten months, the booklet will be cancelled as full payment of principal and interest. The third type is accounts of one or two yuan, also with booklets. For example, if you borrow one yuan from him, you have to pay ten copper coins in interest every day at a certain time when he comes. Then he will stamp a small seal on the booklet as proof that the interest for that day has been collected.</p>
<p>Those who borrow the first type are mostly small clerks in long gowns who borrow from him because they are in dire straits with gambling. The customers of the second and third types are almost entirely ignorant women and vendors. He actually employs four runners. For every yuan lent out, the runner gets a dime commission. At the same time, he also has several brothers who act as thugs for him. If someone defaults on the debt or delays in paying interest, these brothers will give them a good beating. Fortunately, after the beating, he does not worry about the beaten person selling his wife and children to pay off the debt and treat guests. (The jargon is called "pulling the table.")</p>
<p>This high-interest lender is said to have been very poor three years ago. Later, he borrowed one hundred yuan at an interest rate of five cents per yuan per month, mixed for three years, and now not only has he paid off the one hundred yuan, he can actually collect one hundred and twenty or thirty yuan in interest every month. He gets up early every morning and is busy going out to collect interest, and does not return home until three or four in the afternoon. He said that in another nine or six years, he will not have to do this business anymore. But even now, his wife is already wearing a diamond ring on her finger.</p>

<p>So, his face broke into a smile as he said: "The person who was just speaking to me is Qiu Zecheng, the Chief Secretary of Commissioner Lan. He is my elder sister's husband, and as close to me as my own brother. Precisely because of that, he tends to act like an elder brother with a lot of airs. If I were at home, I wouldn't put up with that. But now I need him to get me a letter of recommendation from Commissioner Lan, so there's no choice but to take his orders." "Jia Duocai! I heard you say that Commissioner Lan is a relative of yours. So now, the Chief Secretary is your relative too?" Zhang Jiefu blushed and said, "Perhaps Mr. Jia didn't hear clearly. I said from the beginning that the Chief Secretary is a relative." Jia Duocai laughed and said, "No matter what, you're still better off than me. Look, I've ended up with two refugees from the Gansu famine as relatives." As they spoke, they approached the doorway of Jia Duocai's room. Miss Yue was also secretly peering through a crack in the door, wanting to see the excitement of welcoming the high-ranking central officials. Hearing Jia Duocai's words, especially in front of so many people, she felt truly uncomfortable, and her face immediately turned pale. Fortunately, she was hidden behind the curtain and wasn't seen by Jia Duocai. Zhang Jiefu also had other things on his mind. He didn't pay much attention to Jia Duocai's words. He returned to his room, closed the door, ground ink, spread out paper, and wrote a letter in semi-cursive script. He then took the letter he had written in regular script the previous night and sealed them together in a large official envelope. (299)</p>

<p>As chance would have it, four or five years prior, when my entire family was living in Paris, my mother and several of her elderly friends had experimented with Western hair dyes, and I was determined to introduce them to the Empress Dowager. At that time, I was truly enthusiastic, not even considering that if the hair dye I introduced might not show any good effects, I would inevitably find myself in an awkward situation.</p>
<p>"We have already sent many people out to search," the Empress Dowager lamented to me, "hoping to find a hair dye that neither damages the hair nor stains the scalp, but we have yet to find one, and perhaps never will!"</p>
<p>"This servant can find such a hair dye for the Empress Dowager!" I couldn't help but volunteer.</p>
<p>Her old self smiled slightly upon hearing this.</p>
<p>"You must have seen it in those Western countries. The Westerners are indeed the most ingenious; the things they invent are often as magical as spells.

<h3 id="e153">New Autumn Delicacies <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>The sweltering heat has passed, and the auspicious New Autumn has arrived. I would like to introduce several kinds of Ping-style delicacies to celebrate the coming of autumn. According to legend, the recipes were passed down from the nobility of Beiping. Even the pastry shops in Beiping do not sell them, making them especially precious. Due to space constraints, I will select one of the easier to make and more delicious recipes to introduce below.</p>
<p>Gusao Cakes Prepare the ingredients: two catties of flour, twelve taels of white sugar, half a catty of walnut kernels, four taels of white sesame seeds, one and a half catties of lard, half a spoonful of salt. Prepare the utensils: one Western-style stove or charcoal stove, one rolling pin, one large cup, one flat-bottomed iron pot (size not specified), one wooden mold (carved from fir wood into a hexagonal recessed shape, the size of a silver dollar, with the character "Fu" (福) or "Shou" (壽) engraved in the center; can be custom-made from small workshops). After preparing the ingredients and utensils, first dry-fry the flour in an ordinary iron pot until it turns yellow but not burnt. Transfer it to a large bowl to cool. Separately, remove the skin from the walnut kernels and chop them into fine pieces with a knife. Stir-fry the white sesame seeds and salt separately until cooked and finely ground (grind them with a rolling pin). Mix them together with the white sugar into the fried flour, then slowly add the rendered lard and mix well. Knead into round shapes for the filling (the size should be the same as the recessed shape in the wooden mold). Wrap the filling with dough (the thickness should be the same as wonton wrappers; the dough should be made from half raw flour, half lard, and half boiling water). Place it in the wooden mold, slightly tamp it down, then tap it out. Place it in the flat-bottomed iron pot and bake until both sides are golden brown. It is now complete. The taste is delicious and palatable, with absolutely no overly sweet or greasy taste. A seasonal product for autumn.</p>
<p>Jujube Cakes Prepare the ingredients: one and a half catties of red dates, two catties of rice flour, one catty of brown sugar, half a catty of walnut kernels, half a catty of lard. Prepare the utensils: wooden mold, steamer, rolling pin. Once the ingredients and utensils are ready, you can begin working. Mix two catties of rice flour with about one rice bowl of water. Cook the red dates until tender, remove the skin and pits, and mix them together with the brown sugar. Knead into round shapes and then roll them out with a rolling pin to make the outer skin of the jujube cakes. Separately, cut the raw lard into small squares and chop the walnut kernels into small pieces, then mix them together to make the filling. Pass them through the wooden mold and then steam them in a steamer for half an hour. They can then be taken out and eaten. The taste is especially exquisite and cannot be compared to any sweets sold in the market. The above amounts of ingredients are for making eighty cakes. If you want to make more or less, you can increase or decrease the ingredients accordingly.</p>
<p>Lotus Root Cakes Use the middle section of fresh pond lotus root, peel and wash it thoroughly. Rub it frequently in a rice washing basket to make lotus root paste. Mix it with an equal amount of rice flour, add white sugar, and then fry it in a pot with lard. The flavor is particularly unique, with a glutinous, smooth, and refreshing taste upon entering the mouth. I am fond of eating it, and every autumn, I make sure my family prepares it because it tastes delicious and the method is easy.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Discussion on Typhoid Fever 5 (Part 1) (Taiyang Stage) <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>The most incomprehensible part of the Treatise on Typhoid Fever is "chest bind (結胸)." Regarding the causes of chest bind, it states: "When the disease manifests in the yang and is treated with purgatives, heat enters and forms a chest bind... the reason for forming a chest bind is due to premature purgation." It also states: "In Taiyang disease, the pulse is floating and rapid... if the doctor uses purgatives, the rapid pulse becomes slow, there is pain resisting pressure inside the diaphragm, the stomach is empty and deficient, pathogenic qi moves the diaphragm, causing shortness of breath, restlessness, agitation, vexation in the chest, and the yang qi sinks inward, leading to hardness below the heart, which results in chest bind." Furthermore, it states: "If in typhoid fever on the fifth or sixth day, there is vomiting and fever, use Chaihu Decoction. If the symptoms are present but purgatives are used... if there is fullness and hard pain below the heart, this is chest bind." It also states: "When Taiyang and Shaoyang diseases coexist and purgatives are used, chest bind forms." This refers to chest bind resulting from misapplication of purgatives. However, it also states: "In typhoid fever on the sixth or seventh day, there is heat and substantiality in the chest bind." This indicates that chest bind can occur without the misapplication of purgatives. Cheng Wuji notes: "This does not mention purgation, but says typhoid fever on the sixth or seventh day, which is the actual heat of transmission." Zhang Jianshan notes: "Early purgation leading to chest bind is the norm, while substantial chest bind is a change in circumstances." Cheng Jiaoqian's Treatise on Typhoid Fever Postscript states: "Chest bind... need not be caused by misapplication of purgatives; typhoid fever can directly lead to chest bind on the sixth or seventh day." Wang Lingyou's Differentiation and Pattern Seat notes: "These words on chest bind indicate that there are cases that do not arise from misapplication of purgatives." All of these interpret Zhongjing's statement as referring to chest bind that arises without the misapplication of purgatives. The Treatise on Typhoid Fever also states: "For cold substantial chest bind without heat signs, Three-Ingredient Minor Qi-Invigorating Decoction (三物小陷胸湯) or White Powder (白散) may also be administered." The Song Dynasty edition of the Treatise on Typhoid Fever has a note below this passage: "One source says Three-Ingredient Minor White Powder (三物小白散)." According to the notes, this is correct, but the character "minor (小)" is redundant. Examining the Jade Box Classic (玉函經) and the Supplementary Prescriptions of a Thousand Gold Pieces (千金翼), there is no Qi-Invigorating Decoction or the phrase "may also be administered." Instead, it is written as "Three-Ingredient Minor White Powder," which agrees with what the notes refer to as "one source." The Medical Mirror (醫宗金鑑) also states: "Three-Ingredient Minor Qi-Invigorating Decoction should be Three-Ingredient White Powder." You Zaijing's Collection of Penetrating Pearls (尤在涇貫珠集) also states: "The characters 'Minor Qi-Invigorating Decoction and may also be administered' are likely redundant." Pang Anshi's General Treatise on Diseases (總病論) is written as "Three-Ingredient White Powder," with a note below stating: "Minor Qi-Invigorating Decoction is incorrect." Xu Lingtai's Classified Prescriptions (類方) has a note below White Powder stating: "According to the Living People's Book (活人書), Three-Ingredient White Powder is administered; there is no Minor Qi-Invigorating Decoction. The phrase 'may also be used' indicates that the minor qi-invigorating decoction is a cold remedy and not suitable for cases without heat." The Jade Box Classic is a different version of the Treatise on Typhoid Fever. The content recorded in the Supplementary Prescriptions of a Thousand Gold Pieces is the Treatise on Typhoid Fever of the Tang Dynasty. Zhu Fengyi's Living People's Book and Pang Anshi's General Treatise on Diseases are both from the Song Dynasty, and their content can be relied upon. Therefore, they should be followed. Furthermore, there is no Major White Powder (大白散) in the Treatise on Typhoid Fever, so the character "minor (小)" in the Jade Box Classic and the Supplementary Prescriptions of a Thousand Gold Pieces is also redundant. The Living People's Book and the General Treatise on Diseases should be followed. This chest bind is also not caused by early purgation, and seems to be related to being irrigated with cold water. To summarize the above, the Treatise on Typhoid Fever states that the origin of chest bind is often due to early purgation in typhoid fever, but there are also other causes. Chest bind that arises from heat is "heat substantial chest bind," while chest bind that arises from cold is "cold substantial chest bind."</p>
<p>Regarding the symptoms of chest bind, it states: "Pressing on it causes pain, the cun pulse is floating, and the guan pulse is deep. This is called chest bind." It also states: "In chest bind, the neck is also stiff, resembling a soft spasm." Furthermore, it states: "In chest bind, the pulse is floating and large. Purgation is contraindicated, as it will lead to death." Also, "When all the symptoms of chest bind are present, agitation also leads to death." Moreover, "In Taiyang disease, the pulse is floating and rapid... if the doctor uses purgatives, the rapid pulse becomes slow, there is pain resisting pressure inside the diaphragm, the stomach is empty and deficient, pathogenic qi moves the diaphragm, causing shortness of breath, restlessness, agitation, vexation in the chest, and the yang qi sinks inward, leading to hardness below the heart, which results in chest bind." Also, "In heat substantial chest bind, the pulse is deep and tight, there is pain below the heart, and it is as hard as stone when pressed." Furthermore, "If there is no bowel movement for five or six days, the tongue is dry and parched, there is slight tidal fever in the afternoon, and hardness and fullness extend from below the heart to the lower abdomen, with pain that is unbearable to touch." It also states: "In minor chest bind, the disease is located below the heart, pressing on it causes pain, and the pulse is floating and slippery." To summarize the above symptoms, the pulse cannot be relied upon, as the cun and guan positions do not have two separate levels. Floating means floating in both positions, and deep means deep in both positions. There is no such thing as a cun pulse that is floating and a guan pulse that is deep. "Hardness and fullness extending from below the heart to the lower abdomen, with pain that is unbearable to touch" and "pain below the heart that is as hard as stone when pressed" are the primary symptoms. Any case of typhoid fever that develops these symptoms due to purgation is a case of peritonitis due to intestinal perforation, and is extremely dangerous. Therefore, the Bright Theory (明理論) states: "In typhoid fever, chest bind is the most dreaded condition." The Essential Points of Typhoid Fever (傷寒廣要) states: "In typhoid fever, chest bind is a dreaded symptom." As for neck stiffness and agitation, these indicate that the disease has invaded the brain. Therefore, the Treatise on Typhoid Fever states: "Agitation leads to death." You Zaijing's Collection of Penetrating Pearls states: "Severe neck stiffness indicates severe chest bind." This is peritonitis due to intestinal perforation that has progressed to meningitis. Intestinal perforation in typhoid fever need not be caused by misapplication of purgatives, and can also occur spontaneously. The "substantial chest bind" mentioned in the Treatise on Typhoid Fever refers to this condition. Cold substantial chest bind and minor chest bind are obstructions in the stomach and are not peritonitis due to intestinal perforation. Furthermore, a rapid pulse turning slow, pain resisting pressure inside the diaphragm, shortness of breath, restlessness, agitation, and vexation in the chest are precursors to jaundice, and the symptoms are often like this, resembling chest bind. Therefore, it says: "Yang qi sinks inward, leading to hardness below the heart, which results in chest bind," indicating that the presence of these prodromal symptoms, followed by hardness below the heart, constitutes chest bind. In reality, typhoid fever patients who develop jaundice often have these symptoms. Zhongjing saw that it did not develop into chest bind but rather into jaundice. Therefore, it says: "If there is no chest bind... the body will develop jaundice." This passage is actually describing the symptoms of jaundice, which Zhongjing mistakenly thought was going to develop into chest bind. Chest bind is peritonitis due to intestinal perforation, and the pulse is inevitably thin and rapid. Therefore, the Essential Meanings of Typhoid Fever (傷寒蘊要) states: "A faint, thready, deep pulse and cold hands and feet indicate a difficult prognosis." The Clear Essentials of Typhoid Fever (傷寒證治明條) states: "A deep, faint, thready, and small pulse indicates certain death." However, a rapid pulse turning slow is a characteristic symptom of jaundice, as the pulse in jaundice is often slow. If the pulse in peritonitis due to intestinal perforation turns slow, it inevitably progresses to meningitis, or it may be so. There is no case where the pulse turns slow before the onset of peritonitis due to intestinal perforation.</p>
<p>By examining both the causes and symptoms, it is clear that chest bind is peritonitis due to intestinal perforation. The only hope for survival in peritonitis due to intestinal perforation is surgical intervention to cleanse the contamination, and it certainly cannot be cured with Qi-Invigorating Pills or Qi-Invigorating Decoctions. The statement that "Qi-Invigorating Pills and Qi-Invigorating Decoctions should be used" is not a treatment method. Furthermore, since this disease is caused by purgation, how can it be cured by further purgation? This is what I mean by incomprehensible.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Harvey, the Discoverer of Blood Circulation <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>——Medical Stories 8——</p>
<p>Scientists, calling themselves natural philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome, were deeply interested in the various constant and involuntary movements of the living body. Some of these movements they saw in other people's bodies, and some they perceived in their own bodies. For example: the bellows-like movement of the chest during breathing; the heartbeat and pulse, which they regarded as unrelated to each other; when the skin broke, blood would seep out or gush out, as if the skin itself were full of blood. In the abdomen, they also felt the movements of various internal organs, such as the spasms and peristalsis of the intestines, and the movement of food, etc.</p>
<p>These objective and clear facts naturally needed to be explained. For the natural philosophers of the time, the only possible method was to dissect animal corpses. Due to religious and social concerns and restrictions, they could not examine human corpses. They also could not keep animals alive while dissecting their bodies in order to observe the true activity of the organs. So-called experimental physiology was unknown at the time. Therefore, the ways in which they inferred the activity of living organs from the dissection of lifeless organs were mostly wrong.</p>
<p>Of all these movements, what interested them the most was the movement of the heart and lungs, and the relationship of these movements to blood. From animal dissections, they could easily see that there was a diaphragm separating the chest and abdomen; the air entering and leaving the body passed through the lungs; and the heart was closely attached to the lungs. They did not understand the chemical transformation of inhaled and exhaled air, and assumed the function of the lungs was like a fan, cooling the overheated blood. Black blood was always seen in the veins and the right ventricle of the heart; sometimes a little blood was seen in the left ventricle of the heart; but in the arteries, they saw only air. Therefore, they imagined that the veins transported blood from the lungs to various tissues, and the arteries transported air from the lungs to various tissues.</p>
<p>Galen assumed that the heart was the source of body heat, and blood was the fuel to aid heat. He posed a question to himself: why did the blood in the right and left ventricles of the heart have different colors and densities? His answer came entirely from imagination. He assumed that the blood was filtered as it passed through the small pores in the septum between the right and left ventricles. He certainly could not see these pores, but he said that although you cannot see the pores of the skin, you know that sweat seeps out from the pores of the skin.</p>
<p>These erroneous ideas about blood circulation prevailed for hundreds of years. The credit for establishing the true theory of blood circulation goes to William Harvey. His discovery is one of the important foundations of modern medicine and modern biology. After putting forward the idea that blood circulates throughout the body, people were able to imagine that blood transports nutrients from the digestive tissues and gas from the lungs to various tissues, and also transports waste and toxins to the kidneys, ready to be excreted from the body.</p>
<p>The establishment of the theory that the heart propels blood was very slow. The authoritative medical circles of the Middle Ages blindly followed Galen's theory. Harvey was the first to realize that blood is propelled by the heart to form a systemic circulation. He once said: "I observed the beating heart of animals, and at first imagined that the movement of the heart could only be understood by God, because the contraction and expansion of the heart were so rapid that I could not see when this contraction and expansion occurred." However, he finally pointed out: (1) at the same instant the heart contracts, the artery also beats once; (2) when the artery ruptures, blood spurts out once for each heart contraction; (3) when the heart stops beating at the moment of death, the pulse also stops at the same time. His conclusion was this: the blood vessels are divided into two groups, the arteries carry blood away from the heart, and the veins carry blood into the heart: the black venous blood enters the right side of the heart, passes through the lungs, and turns into bright red blood due to the action of fresh air, returns to the left side of the heart, and is transported to various parts of the body by the arteries. As for how blood flows from the arteries to the veins, this question was not resolved until nine years later when Malpighi discovered capillaries—the slender vessels that connect the small arteries and small veins.</p>
<p>The first powerful evidence proving the circulation theory was the total amount of blood in the body. According to experiments, the heart pumps out one-quarter of an ounce of blood with each beat. According to this calculation, in half an hour, the heart contracts a thousand times, and must pump out ten pounds and five ounces of blood. However, the total amount of blood in the body averages only seven and a half ounces: if the blood were not circulating, there would be no way to resolve the question of how the amount of blood pumped out by the heart exceeds the total amount of blood in the body.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(65) Acute Localized Peritonitis</p>
<p>(Acute Circumscribed Peritonitis)</p>
<p>Q: What is acute localized peritonitis?</p>
<p>A: This is a type of suppurative peritonitis, where the affected area is confined to a local part of the peritoneum, forming a tumor or abscess.</p>
<p>Q: What is the difference between the abdominal symptoms and those of acute generalized peritonitis?</p>
<p>A: The abdominal symptoms are the same as those of generalized peritonitis, but the pain and tenderness are confined to one area, where a tumor with dullness on percussion and fluctuation is formed.</p>
<p>Q: What is the difference between the systemic symptoms of the patient and those of acute generalized peritonitis?</p>
<p>A: The systemic symptoms are also very similar to those of acute generalized peritonitis, but the degree is lighter, and most of the fevers are irregular, resembling remittent fever.</p>
<p>Q: What is the course of suppurative localized peritonitis?</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>A: During the course of the disease, if it can be absorbed, it will be cured; if the disease is prolonged for too long, it will cause general weakness, collapse, and death. Or, it may form an abscess. Some result in scar healing and induration; some cause perforation of the peritoneum, resulting in sepsis.</p>
<p>Q: What are the more important locations where peritoneal abscesses occur?</p>
<p>A: Abscesses under the diaphragm are more important, because if they expand to the right, they can cause secondary abscesses of the right lobe of the liver, the biliary tract, the appendix, or the right kidney; if they invade to the left, they can cause secondary abscesses of the stomach and duodenum, the left lobe of the liver, the spleen, the pancreas, the left kidney, or the pericardium.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of acute localized peritonitis?</p>
<p>A: The onset is acute or insidious, starting with chills and shivering, with localized abdominal pain and tenderness. The skin in the area of pain, in the region of the costal arch, is swollen, and sometimes the lower part of the rib cage or the intercostal spaces expand. The movement of the diaphragm is reduced; therefore, the lower border of the lung does not move during breathing.</p>
<p>Q: When diagnosing acute localized peritonitis, what diseases should it be differentiated from?</p>
<p>A: A rectal or vaginal examination should be performed to differentiate it from a pregnant uterus, a bladder full of urine, or tympanites. It should also be differentiated from empyema, pyopneumothorax, liver abscess, hydatid cyst, perirenal abscess, etc.</p>
<p>Q: What is the best treatment for acute localized peritonitis?</p>
<p>A: It is best to perform surgical drainage early.</p>
<p>Q: How should the patient be cared for?</p>
<p>A: The patient should be kept absolutely quiet and lying flat. An ice pack or warm compress should be applied to the abdomen.</p>
<p>Q: What medications should be taken internally?</p>
<p>A: Mainly pain relievers. For vomiting, use chloroform water or cocaine gastric lavage. For hiccups, use atropine injections. For paralytic ileus, use Physostigmine, Eumydrin, Atropine, etc. to wash the intestines.</p>
<p>Q: What medications should be used for heart failure or collapse?</p>
<p>A: Injections of camphor preparations, caffeine, cardiazole, etc. Or, use physiological saline, Ringer's solution, Locke's solution, etc., plus epinephrine diluted to one thousandth (1 ml) for intravenous injection. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e157">Postscript to the Compilation of Medical Lawsuits <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>After I finished editing the Compilation of Medical Lawsuits, I lingered in my room, pondering and searching, and finally stood up and said: "There are so many cases of medical malpractice lawsuits, and the background is so complex. To remove the fruit, one must first eliminate the cause; to stop the flow, one must first cool the source. If we want to quell the litigious wind and pacify the medical profession, how can our colleagues not fully understand the causes and effects of the numerous medical disputes and think about ways to prevent them?" Please, based on this principle, let me briefly state them:</p>
<p>What is the cause? It is the background. The background of medical lawsuits is not just one aspect. Roughly divided, there are four: Since the establishment of the lawyer system, the people have begun to enjoy legal rights. Corrupt officials who used to manipulate the law can no longer act arbitrarily without any scruples! However, law is a tool to govern people, and its use depends on the individual. Lawyers use the law as their profession. The wise can be fair and honest, aiming to protect human rights. However, due to business reasons, some may resort to inciting discord to achieve their own private interests. As a result, there are more and more lawsuits in society, and doctors are the first to bear the brunt! This is the first. Zhang Shizhi said, "The Minister of Justice holds the balance of the world." Today's courts are what was called the Minister of Justice in ancient times. If the people have grievances, they will appeal to the law. If the judgment is improper, they will immediately seek redress. To prevent grievances, it depends on the judge's careful handling of the case. However, today's judges, in medical cases, lightly accept the case without asking whether the defendant is a licensed physician. Once accepted, they listen only to the emotional pleas of the patient's family and ignore the medical basis. The judgment is difficult to convince people, and appeals are endless. This is the second. Journalists wield the authority of public opinion, which is enough to shift social perceptions. However, when medical cases occur, they always adopt an attitude of recording everything they hear, and they make untrue reports without waiting for the truth to be clarified. This reduces the reputation of the medical profession and the sympathy of society. This is the third. Furthermore, I have heard, "Wood must rot before insects appear, and a country must attack itself before others attack it." The lack of unity within the medical profession is also a cause of lawsuits. When united, strength gathers; when divided, power scatters. Therefore, medical factions exist, and the unity of the medical profession is weakened day by day. Disputes over rights arise, and some even use others to suppress colleagues from different factions due to temporary emotions. If the internal situation is like this, what else can be said? This is the fourth. Summarizing these four points, we can call them the background. As for the way to prevent lawsuits and eliminate unjust cases, there are several ways. Please allow me to elaborate further:</p>
<p>Medicine is a highly specialized science. Whether a patient's failure to recover or death is due to the doctor or the disease cannot be determined by non-experts. Although judges are familiar with the articles of the law, they are not familiar with medical principles. Therefore, when accepting a case, they must consult a formal medical organization to make a fair assessment as a basis for judgment. At the same time, an autopsy must be performed to reveal the truth. Judges must not have any arbitrary attitude in this process. However, what if the judge still acts according to their own will despite the assessment and autopsy? This is why the jury system and compensation for unjust cases must be implemented. With the participation of expert medical examiners, judges will not overstep their authority, and the questioning will be relevant. With compensation for unjust cases, the patient's family will not dare to make false accusations lightly, and judges will not dare to arbitrarily sentence people. Assessment, autopsy, jury, and compensation, the gradual implementation of these four aspects may eliminate medical disputes to some extent. As for the group, it must be united and not easily allow others to take advantage. As for the individual, they must be vigilant and not be negligent in the slightest. This is something that colleagues who read this book should know on their own, and I need not repeat it. Postscript by Song Guobin, September 1, Year 24.</p>

<p>Part Three: Chancroid</p>
<p>The sites of occurrence of chancroid are mainly in the genital area, such as the coronal sulcus, inner surface or tip of the foreskin in men, glans penis, frenulum, external urethral orifice, penile skin and scrotum. In women, it occurs in the posterior commissure (the area between the vulva and anus), external urethral orifice, vaginal opening, external cervical os, and labia.</p>
<p>The symptoms of chancroid vary slightly depending on the site of occurrence. I will list them as follows:</p>
<p>A. In men, when it occurs on the frenulum, the frenulum may be completely eroded or only the bridge-shaped frenulum may remain. This type of chancroid is prone to complications of buboes.</p>
<p>B. When it occurs on the inner surface of the foreskin, the swelling is obvious, and pus easily accumulates, resembling phimosis. At this time, the glans penis may be damaged, leading to necrosis of the entire foreskin and glans penis.</p>
<p>C. When it starts on the glans penis, the symptoms are relatively mild. However, in some cases, it can invade the corpus cavernosum of the penis, leading to gangrene and shedding.</p>
<p>D. When it occurs on the neck of the glans penis, it often spreads around the glans penis in a ring shape, causing ulceration of the external urethral orifice.</p>
<p>E. In women, it often spreads around the labia and vulva.</p>
<p>F. When it occurs on the greater vestibular gland in the vulva, it initially appears as a hard nodule, which later becomes an ulcer, characterized by a volcano-like appearance.</p>
<p>G. When it occurs on the labia minora and clitoris, the swelling is obvious, similar to that occurring on the inner surface of the foreskin in men.</p>
<p>H. When it occurs in the vagina, it is not easily invaded due to its multi-layered squamous epithelial tissue. If it does occur, it must be in the lower or inner part.</p>
<p>The course of chancroid usually takes two to three weeks to seven to eight weeks for complete recovery. However, when new chancroids continue to appear, the course is very long.</p>
<p>C. Diagnosis and Prognosis: The diagnosis of chancroid can be made based on the short incubation period and the unique ulcer state. As for the differential diagnosis, it has been described in detail in the first part with the hard chancre of syphilis. It can be distinguished from the papules of syphilis in the genital area by the non-ulceration of syphilitic papules and the positive Wassermann serological reaction. As for distinguishing it from other diseases, those who understand the unique symptoms and unique reactions of each disease can easily handle it like a butcher dissecting an ox with ease.</p>
<p>The prognosis of chancroid is generally good. However, in cases of serpiginous spread, erosive or gangrenous changes, there may be residual organic defects after healing, or septicemia or massive hemorrhage leading to death.</p>

<p>(61) Dacryocystitis</p>
<p>Dacryocystitis, also known as acute dacryocystitis, or dacryocystic cellulitis, is mostly caused by the transformation of chronic dacryocystitis. Because when suffering from chronic dacryocystitis, its mucous membrane is easily damaged, so that bacteria easily get the opportunity to invade the tissues and develop abscesses. In addition, syphilitic periostitis and glandular periostitis can also induce cellulitis in the lacrimal sac area. The symptoms of this disease are very obvious. At the beginning of its onset, there is severe pain in the lacrimal sac area, and the skin becomes red and swollen. In severe cases, conjunctival, eyelid, or facial edema can also occur. The patient has a fever and restless sleep. After two or three days, the skin of the lacrimal sac area turns yellow, and then it ruptures spontaneously, draining a large amount of pus. At this time, the pain suddenly stops, and the swelling also gradually disappears. The ruptured wound can often turn into a fistula, constantly flowing out pus-like liquid, and then turning into serous-like, and finally turning into watery liquid. This is called a lacrimal fistula. The fistula does not necessarily occur in the lacrimal sac area, but also in its vicinity. Sometimes, although the fistula has closed, the nasolacrimal duct is still not unobstructed, so that it is inevitable to occur again very much. Sometimes the fistula exists for life, and serous or watery liquid often flows out of the ruptured hole.</p>
<p>The treatment principle of lacrimal sac abscess. First, of course, quickly treat chronic dacryocystitis to prevent inducing this disease. Second, before the skin has been destroyed, we should try to drain the liquid accumulated in the lacrimal sac. Third, if the pain is severe and the skin has already turned yellow, it is a clear proof that it has already suppurated. At this time, an incision can be made in the anterior wall of the lacrimal sac to drain the pus. Fourth, if the lacrimal fistula has been around for a long time or is difficult to cure, the lacrimal sac must be removed by resection. This is the best policy.</p>

<p>Childbirth Pain</p>
<p>It is inevitable that women will suffer some pain during childbirth. Childbirth pain is a physiological function. Normal labor lasts about half a day to one and a half days. The first childbirth is more painful. As for why childbirth is painful, most people do not fully understand. The origin of the pain is the intermittent contraction of the uterus. The baby's head is larger than the diameter of the birth canal before delivery, so there must be intermittent contractions to squeeze the baby's head smaller to fit the size of the birth canal. The several long bones of the baby's head were originally movable. The intermittent contractions of the uterus gradually force them tighter, and the large bones of the head overlap at the long bone joints, so the diameter of the head is reduced. The birth canal is not a straight road. With the contraction of the uterus, the head and neck also bend and move down the birth canal. The head must reach a certain position, otherwise it will be a difficult labor.</p>
<p>This is entirely a physiological function. The contraction of the uterus (i.e., pain) shrinks the baby's head. Then, through the birth canal, the head reaches a certain position. The cervix also gradually expands. Until all the functions reach a certain limit, the baby's head is forced out of the birth canal. Then the baby's body follows, and the baby is completely born. After the baby is born, after a few minutes to more than twenty minutes, a relatively peaceful pain arises again until the placenta is expelled, and the childbirth pain comes to an end.</p>
<p>Difficult labor is not only painful, but also sometimes life-threatening. In less severe difficult labor, the mother suffers some pain, and then she can safely pass through. As for absolute difficult labor, without special surgery, both mother and child will be injured.</p>
<p>Primitive men and women lived a rough life, and their whole body muscles were fully developed, healthy, and strong. In the event of childbirth, the muscles contract powerfully and freely. Childbirth can be completed in a short period of time without special pain. The red Indians in South America today still live in ancient times, and these women have childbirth very easily. Even the women in our country who work in the countryside do not consider childbirth as anything special. Those who have more difficult and painful childbirths are those who live comfortable lives now. Their muscles are very underdeveloped and inactive, so childbirth is not very easy.</p>

<h3 id="e161">The Issue of Maturity Period in the Pawnbroking Industry <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Mi Junfu</p>
<p>According to a survey released by the Ministry of Interior in the Republic of China in 1931, the maturity periods of the pawnbroking industry in 15 cities including Shanghai are as follows:</p>
<p>Three-month maturity: Qingdao, 33 establishments. Six-month maturity: Guangzhou, 54 establishments. Eight-month maturity: Guangzhou, 3 establishments. (Editor's note: The original table totaled 62 establishments, it is unknown which is correct.) One-year maturity: Guangzhou, 139 establishments, Xiamen, 5 establishments, Shenyang, 50 establishments, Yingkou, 9 establishments, Andong, 12 establishments, Chengdu, 25 establishments. Total: 240 establishments. Thirteen-month maturity: Qingdao, 2 establishments. Eighteen-month maturity: Shanghai, 48 establishments, Nanjing, 8 establishments, Tianjin, 13 establishments, Hangzhou, 19 establishments, Ningbo, 10 establishments, Shenyang, 5 establishments, Andong, 2 establishments, Chengdu, 12 establishments, Chongqing, 9 establishments. Total: 126 establishments. (The original text says 130 establishments, it is unknown which is wrong, editor's note again.) Two-year maturity: Beiping, 105 establishments, Tianjin, 12 establishments, Guangzhou, 5 establishments, Xiamen, 6 establishments, Jinan, 5 establishments. Total: 133 establishments.</p>
<p>Statistical Table of Maturity Periods of Pawnbroking Industry in 16 Provinces including Jiangsu</p>
<p>According to the above table, except for the pawnbroking maturity period of three months in Qingdao and 40 days in Liaoning, which were established by the Japanese. The shortest pawnbroking maturity period in our country is six months, and the longest is three years. The most common are twelve months, thirteen months, eighteen months, and twenty-four months. Of the 654 pawnbroking establishments surveyed in 15 cities including Shanghai, the percentages of maturity periods are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Maturity Period Establishments Percentage of Total Establishments Surveyed Maturity Period Establishments Percentage of Total Establishments Surveyed</p>
<p>12 Months 240 36.7% (weak) 24 Months 123 20% (strong)</p>
<p>18 Months 130 20% (weak) Total 503 76.7% (strong)</p>
<p>The percentages of maturity periods of the 1,281 pawnbroking establishments surveyed in 16 provinces including Jiangsu Province are shown in the following table.</p>
<p>Maturity Period Establishments Percentage of Total Establishments Surveyed Maturity Period Establishments Percentage of Total Establishments Surveyed</p>
<p>12 Months 355 27.7% (strong) 24 Months 102 8% (weak)</p>
<p>13 Months 269 21% Total 963 75.2% (strong)</p>
<p>18 Months 237 18.5% (strong)</p>
<p>Of these, it is worth noting that the number of establishments with a maturity period of 12 months accounts for the largest number in this survey. A total of 595 establishments in provinces and cities. If 13 months is added, there are a total of 864 establishments, accounting for 44.7% (weak) of the total number of pawnbroking establishments surveyed in provinces and cities (1,935 establishments), approximately half. The number of establishments with a maturity period of 18 months is 367 in total in provinces and cities, accounting for 18.9% (strong) of the total number of pawnbroking establishments surveyed in provinces and cities. The number of establishments with a maturity period of 24 months is 235 in total in provinces and cities, accounting for 12% (strong) of the total number of pawnbroking establishments surveyed in provinces and cities.</p>
<p>Another point to note is that the maturity period of urban pawnshops is often shorter than that of rural pawnshops. Farmers pledge money in the spring and only have money to redeem it in the autumn harvest. If the harvest this autumn is not good, they will postpone the redemption until the next autumn. Their ability to redeem is limited by the season. The pawnbroking customers in urban areas are mostly small industrial and commercial operators or poor citizens, whose income has no seasonal relationship and can redeem it as soon as they pawn it. In this respect, urban pawnshops and rural pawnshops are fundamentally different in nature. The maturity period of both must be stipulated separately according to their nature. According to the above-mentioned survey: Of the maturity periods of pawnshops in 15 cities including Shanghai, 36.7% of the surveyed establishments have a maturity period of 12 months. Of the rural pawnshops, 27.7% have a maturity period of 12 months. The former percentage is obviously higher than the latter. The longest maturity period for urban pawnshops is 24 months, while the longest maturity period for rural pawnshops is 36 months.</p>
<p>The provisions on the maturity period in the separate regulations of the pawnbroking industry in various provinces differ slightly from the above-mentioned actual situation. The following is an excerpt from the provisions on the maturity period in the separate regulations of the pawnbroking industry in various provinces surveyed by the author in 1934:</p>
<p>Location Pawn (or Pledge)</p>
<p>Jiangsu Eleven months (retained for another six months)</p>
<p>Shanghai Eighteen months Eight months</p>
<p>Zhejiang Eighteen months</p>
<p>Anhui Eighteen months</p>
<p>Wuyang, Hubei Six months</p>
<p>Hunan Ten months Seven months</p>
<p>Fujian Twenty months</p>
<p>Guangdong (Pawn) Three years (Pledge) Two years One year or less Six months</p>
<p>Yunnan Six months</p>
<p>Kunming Twelve months</p>
<p>Shandong Thirteen months</p>
<p>Qingdao Thirteen months</p>
<p>Shaanxi Twenty months</p>
<p>Jehol Twelve months Ten months</p>
<p>Guizhou (Pawn) Twenty-seven months (Pledge) Thirteen months (Pledge) Twelve months (Pledge) Ten months</p>
<p>Shanxi Six months</p>
<p>Guangxi Twelve months</p>
<p>Hebei Eighteen months</p>
<p>According to the above table, the regulations on the maturity period in the separate regulations of the pawnbroking industry in various provinces and cities differ slightly from the actual situation. However, except for small pledges, they are generally more than twelve months, with some as long as three years. Whether this maturity period is appropriate depends on the interests of both the pawnbroking industry and the pawn customer, and the type of pawned goods. The following lists the maturity periods of pawnshops in various important countries for reference:</p>
<p>Table of Maturity Periods of Profit-Making Pawnshops in Major Countries Country Maturity Period</p>
<p>United Kingdom One year and seven days</p>
<p>United States Twelve to eighteen months (different in each state, this is based on the draft standard pawnshop rules)</p>
<p>Germany Six months to one year</p>
<p>Japan Ordinary four months to six months Table of Maturity Periods of Public Welfare Pawnshops in Major Countries</p>
<p>France Ordinary one year</p>
<p>Switzerland Six months</p>
<p>Belgium One year</p>
<p>Germany Ordinary six months to one year</p>
<p>Austria One year</p>
<p>Japan Four months</p>
<p>Illinois, USA One year</p>
<p>According to the above two tables, it can be seen that the ordinary maturity period for pawnshops in various countries, whether private or public, is one year, which is roughly similar to the situation in our country.</p>
<p>The general situation of the maturity period is as described above. The following discusses what is the appropriate number of months for the maturity period in our country. The following is an exploration from various aspects:</p>
<p>First, thinking from the perspective of the pawn customer</p>
<p>The reason why the shortest maturity period is stipulated in the pawnbroking regulations is originally for the protection of the pawn customer, which is the same as the intention of stipulating the highest interest rate. Although the pawn customer and the pawnbroker are nominally in an equal position and trade freely. However, in fact, the pawn customer is often in a disadvantageous position compared to the pawnbroker due to the urgency of needing money and the weakness of economic strength. Therefore, national legislation is necessary to protect the weak. If the maturity period is too short, the opportunity to redeem is reduced, and the loss to the pawn customer is great. Take Japan as an example: In Japan, in 1906, the ordinary maturity period in Tokyo was eight months. The ratio of the value of pawned goods to the total amount of loans was 7%. Later, the maturity period was gradually shortened. This ratio also gradually increased. By 1913, the ordinary maturity period was four to six months, and the ratio of the value of pawned goods to the total amount of loans increased to 12%. Therefore, Article 8 of the Japanese Public Welfare Pawnbroking Law stipulates:</p>
<p>"The maturity period shall not be less than four months from the date of establishment of the pledge contract. If the maturity period is less than four months, it shall be changed to four months."</p>
<p>The above-mentioned article is compulsory in nature. It is a typical regulation to stipulate the maturity period to protect the interests of the pawn customer. However, if the maturity period is too long, the interest increases with time, making the pawn customer unable to redeem, which is also detrimental to the pawn customer.</p>
<p>Second, thinking from the perspective of the pawnbroking industry</p>
<p>From the perspective of the pawnbroking industry, shortening the maturity period is more beneficial. (A) The storage time of the pawned goods is short, the style has not yet become outdated, and it is easier to sell. (B) Recover the loan in a short period of time and provide it for use again, and the capital turnover is active. (C) If the pawned goods are commodities or agricultural products, the price changes are small, and there is no unexpected loss. However, what is the purpose of the pawnbroking business? It is to collect interest, not to profit from the disposal of pawned goods. Moreover, at this time when the disposal of pawned goods is extremely difficult, the pawnbroker is making every effort to reduce the number of pawned goods. If the maturity period is too short, there will be more pawned goods. Therefore, it is not only unfavorable to the pawn customer, but also not what the pawnbroker wants.</p>
<p>Third, observing from the historical evolution</p>
<p>Commercial behavior is gradually becoming more complex and seeking agility due to social and economic relations. Financial institutions are the center of commerce. Therefore, commercial banks mainly provide short-term loans. Although our country's pawnshops mainly provide consumer funds and rural loans, there is also a trend of gradually shortening the loan period. For example, in Hubei, the pawnbroking period was 16 months in the Qing Dynasty. In 1927, it was changed to 12 months. Now in Wuyang, it has been shortened to 6 months. In Japan, the pawnbroking period was 12 months in the Tokugawa era. In the early Meiji era, it was 8 months. Now it has been shortened to four to six months. The trace of evolution is clearly visible. In our country's pawnbroking, the general public psychology is that most people have a maturity period of 18 months, but according to the above-mentioned survey, it is known that a maturity period of 12 months is already more common than 18 months.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above points, a maturity period that is too long is not only detrimental to both the pawn customer and the pawnbroking industry, but also inconsistent with modern social and economic relations. Therefore, theoretically speaking, it is necessary to shorten the maturity period of more than 18 months. Furthermore, based on the facts, most countries have a maturity period of 12 months. In our country, the current customs in various places and the separate regulations of various provinces and cities also have the most maturity periods of 12 months. Therefore, in the future, the maturity period of pawnbroking in our country should be determined to be 12 months as the standard, and then it should be determined in consideration of the local situation (different urban and rural areas) and the type of pawned goods (such as agricultural products should be determined according to the season and modern women's clothing changes too quickly, the period should be shortened).</p>

<p>— Zeng Chun</p>
<p>The increase in production in various manufacturing countries, except the United States, can be proved by the figures on the consumption side. The table below shows the amount of world cotton consumption reported by the International Cotton Textile Federation. (Unit: 1,000 bales of cotton linter excluded):</p>
<p>World Cotton Consumption Table</p>
<p>Figures for the six months ending January 31</p>
<p>× Germany is not included because there is no report available for reference</p>
<p>According to the above table, it can be seen that the world consumption of other types of cotton seems to be increasing. The consumption of American cotton has actually decreased in the past two years. The six months ending January 31, 1935, still have the same trend compared with the same period last year. That is, the United States reduced by 1,028,000 bales, while other types of cotton increased by 1,448,000 bales. The distribution of American cotton consumption by various countries in recent years is listed below:</p>
<p>According to the above table, it can be seen that American cotton growers almost completely rely on exports. Between 1931 and 1934, Japan's consumption of American cotton increased significantly. This is because Japan's consumption of Indian cotton decreased from 1,697,000 bales to 1,224,000 bales. However, from the perspective of the United States, it is also the largest customer of Japanese raw silk.</p>
<p>Although cotton is the most important of the textile fibers. However, since the European War, its increase in consumption has been less than that of the other three textile fibers. This can be seen from the table below.</p>
<p>1929-32</p>
<p>Among the above textile fibers, rayon has made rapid progress in the past. In the past year, the total world output has reached 7.91 million bales. The success of this emerging textile fiber is due in part to the improvement in quality; in part to the large manufacturers using their incentive policies to reduce costs for customers. As a result, rayon has taken over the original markets of cotton, silk, and wool. Therefore, the increase in cotton prices has indirectly caused rayon to take its place and replace it. Although cotton prices may fall in the future due to the increase in production in various countries, the process of redistributing production will take a considerable amount of time. If this is true, is the United States willing to lose its important export business? This is a question. As far as we know, the United States government has consulted with various governments on an international plan to limit cotton production. However, no country has agreed to this unnatural restriction. They all hope to share the remaining profits after the United States reduces production. Therefore, if the United States continues to use restrictions to raise cotton prices, this is a policy that is unlikely to be successful! (The End)</p>

<p>Mr. Feng Hefa studies rural economics and can collect and discuss the conditions of rural areas in various places. He is down-to-earth and does not favor empty talk, which is different from those who like to talk loftily at the moment. He has previously published his usual collections to fellow enthusiasts, named "Chinese Rural Economic Data." The first edition was published and was well received by all parties. In a few months, it was reprinted. Now Mr. Feng has accumulated years of energy and collected more than 100 kinds of the latest materials, and compiled a "Supplement" in one volume. The materials are more refined than the first edition, and the compilation method is also newer than before. For example, the first edition uses geography as the classification standard, and the supplement uses the problem classification, which is more convenient for reference. The whole book has more than a thousand pages and is currently on sale for a special price pre-order. Purchasing the first and supplemental volumes together costs only four yuan (original price eight yuan and eight corners). Purchasing the supplemental volume alone costs only two yuan (original price four yuan). This offer ends at the end of this month, and the date of posting will be used for out-of-town orders. A sample is available upon request, and advance orders can be placed at Liming Bookstore, 4th Ma Road, Shanghai, and at designated distributors in various ports.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, causing the silver dollar market to feel even more stable. All kinds of settlements also stopped as usual. The market price for foreign exchange remained at one dime and five cents in the morning and afternoon, with no change seen. Headed silver transactions also ceased due to the holiday, so there were no quotations. For chop transactions, morning transactions totaled over 3.5 million, with new transactions exceeding 200,000. There was no activity in the afternoon session. Transactions in the Small General Association totaled over 400,000. As for money shops, because the end of the month was approaching, they were not slightly affected by the bank holiday. On the contrary, receipts from foreign public bonds were more than usual, totaling over 44 million. Remittances from various routes exceeded 500,000, foreign pledges exceeded 300,000, customer sources were 200,000, and outward payments were 100,000. All other transactions were at a standstill. As for subsidiary coins, although the market price had slight variations, the amount was very small, and the overall trend was also stable. For Jiangnan small silver, the morning market changed to five cents, trading at 832.5 yuan, with 2,000 coins traded. The afternoon market rebounded and opened at 833 yuan, resulting in the same outcome as the morning market, with 3,000 coins traded. For Guangdong small silver, the morning market increased by six cents, opening at 738.6 yuan. The afternoon market increased by another three cents, changing to 738.9 yuan, so the final result was slightly better by nine cents compared to the previous market, with 125,000 coins traded in the morning market and 50,000 coins traded in the afternoon market. Copper coins were shorter by 500 cash compared to the previous day, at 344,500 cash, with a transaction volume of 41,340 strings of cash, equivalent to 12,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The long-term loans issued by various banks and money shops in Shanghai on behalf of Ningbo banks are substantial, estimated to be no less than 30 million. Now that a financial crisis has occurred in Ningbo, there are plans to recall most of these loans in order to maintain stability. Therefore, letters have been sent to the Shanghai agents of various banks, urging them to find ways to recover the loans. However, Shanghai is also affected by various factors, making it difficult to achieve the desired outcome. Detailed information about these matters was recorded in this newspaper a few days ago. It is now heard from people in the industry that although these long-term loans still have more than a month before they are due, time flies quickly, and the deadline will arrive in the blink of an eye. If preparations are not made in advance, it will be difficult to resolve the situation when the time comes. Therefore, financial leaders plan to discuss and resolve the issue in the near future. The most difficult point is that this year, due to the inability of money shops to issue loans, all businesses feel financially strained, and they have no surplus to repay old debts. Moreover, these long-term loans are mostly rollovers from last year or the previous term, with new loans accounting for less than one or two tenths of the total. If strict measures are taken, there is a risk of a complete collapse. If a moderate approach is taken, Ningbo banks may not be satisfied. How can this issue be resolved? We will continue to report on this after the industry authorities have convened a meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Securities   Bond Market Stable Last Week —Fluctuations of Only One Yuan All Week— <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Last week, from August 19th to 24th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was in the final week of futures trading for August. Although the four trading sessions have resumed, there is no sign of prosperity in buying and selling. Various groups are entering and exiting, with considerable volume from No. 48, but the trend is slow and not urgent. In addition, general retail investors are very eager to buy, mainly because the political situation has been resolved satisfactorily since Premier Wang's reinstatement. After Rhodes arrives in China in the future, he will inevitably contribute to our country's economy to some extent. People's sentiment is quite firm. Arbitrage transactions are frequently discovered, so the market situation has remained stable throughout. The biggest difference in the entire week's fluctuations is only a review of one yuan. Usually, there are only half a yuan rises and falls. The market price result for the whole week is a slight increase in near-term contracts and a decrease in distant contracts, amounting to only about half a yuan. Based on the situation on the trading floor, the future trend seems to be turning small, but market sentiment is quite stable, so it does not seem to cause a downward trend. The total transaction volume was 87.775 million yuan. The weekly highs and lows are listed and compared as follows (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Singapore Feng Yang Hang reported that yesterday (August 24th), the New York stock market prices fell. Experts believe that, based on the Wheeler-Rayburn Public Utility Holding Company Act, most public utility securities companies will be dissolved. Therefore, a large number of utility stocks are being dumped. As the market closed, the selling pressure intensified, extending to other parts, and many people rushed to sell, causing prices to fall step by step. Small exchange stocks were mixed and weak, and the bond market was also small, with a half-day turnover of 1.12 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with declines of 9 to 13 points for all months. Trading activity was mostly long liquidation and arbitrage sales in New Orleans, the South, and the Far East. Due to the nine-cent loan policy, the market price was difficult to stabilize, and there was a unanimous sell-off. Dealers and short covering were the best buyers of the day. Many believe that cotton farmers will rebel in the current situation, and this policy will make cotton farmers determined to hoard cotton. Later, because Southern senators strongly advocated a 12-cent loan, sellers were slightly concerned, and the market closed weak. Spot prices fell by 25 points, and futures prices fell by 21 to 25 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 3 points, and futures prices fell by 1 point. The Indian cotton market was sluggish, with Pingguoer falling by 1.75 rupees, Omura falling by 2.5 rupees, and Bailuo Creek falling by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated August 24th):</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bailuo Creek cotton for the April-May term on August 26th was 194 rupees, up 1.5 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>

<p>The news that the registration issue for Chaozhou sugar has been resolved and exports can resume as usual has spread to various ports, so quite a few people from Shanghai inquired and telegraphed to purchase. However, according to a telegram from Shantou yesterday, the registration of Chaozhou sugar has been hindered again, and exports are still not allowed. If the decision is further delayed, the price of Chaoqing sugar in Shanghai will inevitably rebound. The key to the rise and fall lies in this.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various groups were Nos. 12 and 13 (with a total of more than 2,000 shi). The sales market in this street has been sluggish for a long time, and even the wholesalers only bought about a hundred bags from the Qingdao group. Therefore, even with the best efforts of the sellers, facing the scorching heat of autumn and the increasing supply, they could not avoid lowering prices. As a result, cheap goods became even cheaper, and the market situation became increasingly depressed, presenting an irreversible situation. As the market declined daily, the prices of various thick japonica and thin indica rice fell by one or two cents yesterday. As for Du Yang Jian, because it is similar in color to other varieties and there was a shortage in the market yesterday, the price did not fall. However, Dongxin japonica still fell by two cents, and Yinbian Yuan had no market.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over twenty sources from Hexia. The market for various goods was sluggish. The white japonica market was flat in the morning. Later, due to slight movement from the stores and surrounding villages, the market became high-priced and weak, with medium and low grades settling. The supply of Dongxin japonica continued to arrive, and retail sales were average. The market price was slightly lower by two cents. Retail demand for early rice was slow, and the price was slightly lower by one or two cents. In addition to the small discounts for thin indica rice, there were not many arrivals of new Can Jian Tuan Jian, and demand was also weak. The price was weakly lower by one cent. Although the truck transport of new customer Jian was not strong, the outbound routes were also not good, and the price was slightly lower by a few cents to about one cent. Since Yuan, the price has been slightly firmer. There was not much change in other goods.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Leisure and Decadence <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>If we pay attention to the state of literature and art in each dynasty, we can deduce the rise and fall of the country. This is not superstition, but a reality, because literature and art mostly belong to the people. Whether it is prose or poetry, it mostly represents the language of the masses, so by looking at its poetry and prose, we can deduce the state of the country. The works of the early Tang poets were all majestic. Yang Jiong's poem: "Snow darkens the painted flags, the wind is mixed with the sound of drums. I would rather be a centurion than a scholar." Luo Binwang's poem: "The full moon approaches the shadow of the bow, the stars enter the sword's edge. I will not learn from Yan Dan, singing in vain the cold waters of Yi." Both have a great sense of anger and ambition. After several years, this spirit has been worn away. What remains is leisurely sentiment, decadent pleasure, and slight sorrow of parting. People seem unable to muster the energy, as if they have just recovered from illness, weak and without strength. It seems that the era forces them to act like this. We cannot blame our writers for being unenterprising in this era. It is the environment of the era that makes it so. Not only now, but every dynasty is the same. We see the works of the late Song Dynasty:</p>
<p>"Magnificent buildings face each other, connecting with the envoy's star, peace has been made between the north and south. We must buy wine and urge merriment. When else can we find peace?" — Song Wu Zeli's poem.</p>
<p>Is this situation the same as now? What people seek is just a respite of ease, confined in an ivory tower, unable to see the state of society and the country. No, perhaps they can see it, but there is always a feeling of "I can't manage so much," so they can only enjoy themselves temporarily. "A boatload of Dongting oranges has been bought, new white ramie garments are tailored in the color of snow. Calling Wu girls for a drink together, the spring breeze sends me to Jiangnan." (Wu Zeli's poem) This is truly the behavior of a young master. Some people enjoy themselves like this, while others want to leave the world, to become a hermit who escapes the world. "I have found a good place to escape Qin, peach blossoms are in spring again. Do not let the falling flowers follow the flowing water, for fear that fishermen will come to ask about the law." That era allowed escape from reality, but this era does not allow escape. If we do this, we can only wait for the demon to open its mouth and devour us. Our leisure will not last long, and this ivory tower is no place to live. We open our eyes and see:</p>
<p>"The thatched house and the palace turn into sunset, lonely clouds drift and what to rely on—the landscapes are originally the same, but half of the cities and people are no longer there..." — (Wen Tianxiang's poem)</p>
<p>How many people at this time have no home, no freedom, and nothing? We are still talking about leisure here and leisure there. This is really too much!</p>
<h3 id="e174">A Meeting with Beatrice <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>"The god of love suddenly descended at this time,</p>
<p>His solemn appearance when he came truly makes me afraid to recall it now."</p>
<p>——Dante New Life</p>
<p>Along the Arno River, Beatrice and I walked slowly step by step, and together got into a small boat. She was wearing a simple olive-colored gauze dress, which harmonized with the colors of the woods, hedges, and grasslands; her shadow reflected in the waves, as if the bright clouds in the sky were reflected upside down. She was silent, she stared at me with those incomparable beautiful eyes. Virgil, he had returned to the Linba residence; Beatrice accompanied me across the Arno River—the paradise on earth.</p>
<p>Under the intertwined locust trees, I walked with her. Cicadas were chirping on the locust trees, making this place especially quiet, and we could hear each other's breathing.</p>
<p>"She is a god, she is the master of nature, she is the great harmony of wisdom and beauty," I thought.</p>
<p>I seemed to see countless angels surrounding her, singing songs and scattering flowers. If I were dust, I would willingly let her trample on me.</p>
<p>"Who was that who just went back? Where did he come from with you? Where did he go back to?" she asked.</p>
<p>"He, Virgil, a poet and also a philosopher. He said that according to your will, he is looking after my destiny. We have traveled through the layers of hell, and we saw the words "Those who enter here, abandon all hope" on the gates of hell. Now, Virgil, he has returned to that gloomy old place."</p>
<p>"One, I see that you always have a melancholy face, isn't there a time when you should have a smile?"</p>
<p>"B, Smile? I am smiling now, in front of you. I used to believe that the dawn was not far away, and that when the sun came out, we could have a happy day. I now know that we are in the midst of a long night, and the aurora borealis occasionally shines through, but it is still so dark, without a glimmer of light."</p>
<p>"Are there not many companions walking in the darkness with you?"</p>
<p>"I remember that there was a group of people who traveled with me at the beginning. Everyone was very young, believed that they could open their eyes in the darkness, and believed that by searching and groping, they could always get out of this circle of darkness. Before long, some of my companions fled back, some fell into traps and were never seen again; and some sat there waiting for dawn. I am so lonely, without companions, groping in the dark forever."</p>
<p>The two of us walked to the shade of a willow tree, and I sat down with her. In front of us was a small river, the surface of the water was rippled by a gentle breeze. Above, the cicadas in this tree and the cicadas in that tree played a slow, drawn-out hissing sound. Behind us, the long-necked white geese on the leather ground came over, occasionally "flapping their wings and shouting loudly. At this time, I felt that everything before was an illusion, only this great harmony was real; but then I felt that this great harmony was an illusion, and the real thing must be those terrible nightmares. She seemed to feel the same way, she asked me:</p>
<p>"D, What are you thinking about?"</p>
<p>"What do I think about? That should be what I really think about. I used to believe that there were black and white, right and wrong, two distinct sides; I divided the people around us into two different groups, friends and enemies, and I divided what I heard and saw into two different judgments, which should be approved or opposed. I now know that it is not that simple, on the chessboard of interests, friends and enemies, approval or opposition, change in an instant, and it is simply indistinguishable. There is no reality worth my attachment, my last attachment is "love".</p>
<p>Beatrice listened to him with a smile, she said nothing.</p>
<p>"I used to be enthusiastic about politics; my father was a Guelph, so I was a Guelph too. Later, because of the fear of destruction, I felt that I should love the country, so I became a Ghibelline. When I was still a child, I saw puddles of fresh blood on the ground on the way to school every day; this terrible shadow has always disturbed me. Later, I was forced to flee the city of Florence and wandered for a long time in the ruins of Ravenna. When the youthful fervor had faded away, I withdrew from the political circles. I thought that my heart, my soul, should have a place to rest, like white clouds hiding in rocky valleys.</p>
<p>When I said "white clouds hiding in rocky valleys," my voice trembled a little. At this time, a strong wind was blowing, and dark clouds in the sky were flying over in clusters, and raindrops were falling from above. Raindrops were falling densely on our heads. The trees across the river were shrouded in thick fog and could not be recognized. The two of us looked at the misty rainy scene leaning on the railing. Splashing raindrops wet her hair: only a few green flies were circling around the table, and the white geese were flapping their wings on the leather ground. I felt that the bright scene just now was a kind of harmony, and now this hazy wilderness was also a kind of harmony. From nature's point of view, it seems that nothing is not a kind of harmony. And her bright smile showed the revelation of nature.</p>
<p>"White clouds hiding in rocky valleys? Haven't you seen white clouds floating out? Cherishing "love" has both bright sunny snow, and dark misty rain, and also storms roaring in the dark night."</p>
<p>She slowly uttered each word, each sentence with rhythm. Her eyes were shining.</p>
<p>"The green mountains after the rain will be more beautiful!" I said.</p>
<p>The sky has cleared, and the distant mountains, deep forests, plains, and waves compose a new tune of harmony. She walked along the river, serenely and solemnly.</p>
<p>"She is a god, she is the master of nature, she is the great harmony of wisdom and beauty!"</p>
<p>I thought this way, and again went down the small boat with her. The small boat swayed on the waves, and the white clouds found their home in the rocky valleys!</p>
<h3 id="e175">On a Yangtze River Steamer <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Laizi</p>
<p>Late at night, when I was fast asleep, my mother suddenly woke me up:</p>
<p>"Hansheng, look! What's that calling? ... I just came back from the women's latrine at the stern..."</p>
<p>I dragged my shoes. The stewards were sprawled on the floor like dead pigs, snoring loudly; even the night watchman was leaning against the cabin door, asleep. The other passengers were also asleep, only two were still smoking opium, talking about some incomprehensible, trivial matters.</p>
<p>The river wind was howling. The stars in the sky were pierced by patches of thick black clouds. The waves were hitting the deck madly, desperately, sending out a deep, sharp, painful cry along with the splashing foam! My mother shrank her body and walked to the stern, where she pointed to the dark corner of the women's lavatory.</p>
<p>"There! Right there... there in the corner! There's some kind of sound..."</p>
<p>"Shall I call a steward?" I said.</p>
<p>"No! Go and see, there won't be a ghost... it might be a person..."</p>
<p>I leaned against the iron railing of the deck and stretched my head over: there was a intermittent, miserable sob coming from below, from the splash of the waves:</p>
<p>"Aiyo... a-aiyo..."</p>
<p>"Go over there! Go over there a little more and listen!" Mother said pushing my body anxiously.</p>
<p>"It's a person, a woman!" I replied resolutely, "She's probably hanging there with a rope, under that horizontal iron bar..."</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, following my mother's orders, I rescued that distressed woman alone, secretly and daringly.</p>
<p>She was heavily pregnant, a country woman of about forty years old. Her armpits and chest were almost swollen by the straps. When Mother pulled her to the dim lamplight in front of the women's lavatory door to question her, she cried quietly with a pair of small eyes with turnip flower lumps, fearfully.</p>
<p>"Don't cry! Silly woman! The stewards will hear you and you'll be dead..." Mother said consolingly and admonishingly.</p>
<p>She began to recount her life story, sadly and simply: because there was a famine in the countryside, she was dragging her pregnant belly, wanting to flee with her husband and children from Hankou to Wuhu, where she had some relatives. Without tickets, the husband and children were driven ashore by the stewards when the ship sailed, and she secretly hung there, and because it was night, she was not discovered...</p>
<p>Turning to me, my mother sighed a long breath and said:</p>
<p>"Two lives! Almost... if the strap had broken..." Turning back to her: "You hide in this lavatory for now, it will be dawn soon. We can speak well to the treasurer for you, and maybe we can take you to Wuhu..."</p>
<p>We went back to the cabin to sleep. Mother was still sighing for a long time!... But, as soon as dawn broke, the stewards started making a racket!</p>
<p>"Hansheng! Come! They're going to beat her to death..." Mother stamped her feet anxiously, pulling my ear. She didn't know what time she got up.</p>
<p>"Who?" I said vaguely, still half asleep.</p>
<p>"That pregnant woman! The one we rescued last night!... The stewards are beating her!..."</p>
<p>We hurried to the stern, where it had already been surrounded by a large group of early risers. A thin treasurer with glasses and wearing pajamas stood in the center, biting a cigarette leisurely, directing the stewards' interrogation. The pregnant woman bent over, shrinking into a ball, trembling, and crystal clear blood flowed from her disheveled hair. The onlookers mostly seemed to be watching a play, feeling quite happy; only a few showed "helpless" sympathy, shaking their heads and sighing!</p>
<p>We squeezed into the crowd, Mother following closely behind me. A one-eyed steward holding a stick showed an impatient face to us. Another, a pockmarked, fierce fellow, opened his dog-like yellow eyes and looked at the treasurer for instructions, then rushed to the trembling body of the pregnant woman and gave her a hard kick—</p>

<p>— By S. Ersaijifu. Jin Siji, translated by Su Ming</p>
<p>As he started to clean his sheepskin coat, Prokhor said to him, "What do you need a coat for? It's summer."</p>
<p>Shavaka turned around and replied, "Why? So my father won't be cold."</p>
<p>He carefully examined the small boat, settled his weak, pale, elderly father in the stern, and prepared to depart.</p>
<p>"Come back in June, child," his brother said. "The things you're taking will be needed then."</p>
<p>"What could stop me?" Shavaka replied, spitting in his hands and immediately gripping the oars. His jaws tightened as he rowed the boat towards the yellow, dirty river.</p>
<p>They hadn't gone far when Shavaka asked his father where his name—Kolt—came from. He had never asked this before.</p>
<p>His father replied, "Probably from your grandfather."</p>
<p>"Then where did he get it from?" Shavaka asked again.</p>
<p>His father looked at him, then at the river around them, and said with a frown, "He probably got it from his grandfather."</p>
<p>They said no more.</p>
<p>On the twelfth day of their journey, just as they reached the town's hospital, his father died. Shavaka buried him in the town cemetery. He obtained a death certificate for his father, hid it deep inside his clothes, and then set off, not returning to Spiask, but continuing along the river.</p>
<p>He had already made up his mind. Even if his father had been alive when he arrived at the hospital and had been handed over to the doctors, he would still have done exactly the same.</p>
<p>As he left the town, he felt extremely upset, not because he was thinking of his dead father, but because he was thinking of the teacher, Alyosha. "Good, you girl. You have a red head, but you have a black heart."</p>
<p>All summer, Shavaka left Spiask, bid farewell to the girl who had hurt him, just as the reindeer farm had harmed his father, and traveled as far as possible. In the town, he used the money he earned from selling his father's clothes to buy the most essential items for a long journey. Among them were skis, scrap iron, old nails, and clumsy fishing nets. He stayed as far away from big cities as possible. He sometimes hunted, but he mostly lived by fishing, because he was careful to conserve his gunpowder and bullets.</p>

<p>Life is like a rushing torrent,</p>
<p>Carrying you forward,</p>
<p>Without stopping, never letting you look back.</p>
<p>Who knows where it will drift to?</p>
<p>Place hope in tomorrow,</p>
<p>Place hope in the distance,</p>
<p>Move forward! Steadily brace your feet,</p>
<p>Effortlessly raise the oar,</p>
<p>Let caution always be in your eyes,</p>
<p>Be careful of hitting reefs,</p>
<p>Be careful of the misty miasma,</p>
<p>Be careful of sudden wind and rain,</p>
<p>And the undulating, frightening waves.</p>
<p>Move forward! Seriously grip the rudder,</p>
<p>Let courage support your heart,</p>
<p>Don't fear the scorching sun,</p>
<p>Don't fear the piercing cold,</p>
<p>Don't fear the desolate night's frost and dew,</p>
<p>Don't fear ten thousand mountains and rivers,</p>
<p>Even if dark clouds cover the stars and moon,</p>
<p>And darkness occupies the universe,</p>

<h3 id="e179">Crowning of the Standard Beauty <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>This year, the extent of the flooding in our country, the breadth of the affected area, and the severity of the loss of life and property for the people are almost impossible to calculate. Therefore, this flood is not only more severe than the people remember, but it is also the most unprecedented catastrophe in recent decades. However, our country's society is subjected to the dumping of foreign goods from the outside, and the bankruptcy of rural areas from the inside. The market is sluggish, industry is in decline, and the economy is depleted. The ability to provide disaster relief is almost zero. Therefore, we have to use the term "entertainment without forgetting disaster relief" to call for support, which is originally a "laughing through tears" kind of thing.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, the seriousness of such a flood and the tragic cries of the famine victims should naturally prompt all our compatriots who have not suffered this disaster to act with conscience and donate generously for emergency relief. Originally, there was no need to make a big fanfare under the names of various art performances and beauty pageants to call for support. If disaster relief efforts have to resort to such titles to appeal to the public, then the general audience will only think of entertainment and not of the disaster victims. Judging from such charitable efforts, it is not only possible to infer the weakness of the sense of compassion among the Chinese people, but it is also a complete demise of human morality.</p>
<p>Using art performances to help disaster relief is originally an unfortunate act of "healing the immediate wound at the cost of cutting out the heart". It also takes advantage of the psychological weaknesses of our compatriots to accomplish this. Therefore, whether Xu Lai deserves the title of "Oriental Standard Beauty" or not is not worth discussing. Even if she does, the election is over and it's done. There is no need for so-called crowning and awarding titles, or to further embellish the event and promote each other. It is not only ridiculous to the world, but it also insults the personality of contemporary ladies. It is appropriate that the Chinese Women's Progressive Association has voiced its strong disapproval.</p>
<p>Promoting extravagance and encouraging frivolity are originally vices of society. Moreover, at a time when the New Life Movement is being promoted and the social economy is declining, such actions are contrary to the current trends of life. Even in terms of disaster relief efforts, if the association spends one less penny, the disaster victims will receive one more penny of relief. If the association spends one more penny, the famine victims will receive one less penny of aid. Assuming that without such absurd and ridiculous actions, it would not be enough to attract a large audience, it should be known that the cost of various expenses incurred by this event is also considerable. I am afraid that the gains do not outweigh the losses.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we speak profoundly about this kind of ridiculous behavior, it is a mentality of gloating over misfortune. In terms of facts, it is also taking advantage of the opportunity to gain personal vanity. In short, the purpose of this disaster relief art performance was originally to help the disaster victims. If the purpose can indeed be achieved, benefiting both the public and private sectors, it is originally a passive relief measure. If it is only in name and not in reality, nominally for disaster relief, but the famine victims receive little benefit, only adding to this meaningless action, then one cannot help but sigh deeply.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Random Notes in Early Autumn <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>1.  A Wanderer's Emotions</p>
<p>Standing alone in the autumn wind, September's clothes remain uncut.</p>
<p>In the evening, with nothing to do, I stood by the window, quietly gazing at the sky gradually enveloped in twilight. When a gust of evening wind with a hint of coolness blew against my face, I couldn't help but silently recite two lines of poetry by the ill-fated poet Huang Zhongze, which I could never forget. As a result, my mood immediately sank into a state of melancholy. My seemingly frozen emotions rippled slightly. My thoughts began a lonely, sorrowful journey. No one believes that time flies by so quickly. Remembering the autumn when I left home, it seems as clear as if it were just yesterday, but counting it, it has already been the fourth autumn since then. During this time, I have crossed some oceans, and also crossed some cities and towns, as well as some villages. The long days of several years have all been very rushed, never staying in any place for a longer period of time, just like a very hardworking person, what is it ultimately for? Perhaps it is really for something, otherwise why would I push my body and mind so tirelessly? However, I do not know. I only know that I have indeed walked many roads and seen many things, but I have not obtained anything real. I have only earned boundless emptiness and a boundless feeling of vagueness. As for the result of long journeys, it has made me an extremely weary and meaningless tired person. And I have become a wandering soul with no hope, no joy, and even no emotions.</p>
<p>The coarse web of vulgar life will turn your emotions into lead weights. I think people are always pitiable, always passing from one season to another in such a muddleheaded way, year after year, and each season always pays me a heavy spiritual burden, and real worries and pressures. Wanderers never have a day of stability: the scorching summer seems easy to get through; once summer goes and autumn comes, the snowy winter days follow closely behind, and the winter clothes are locked inside the shikumen, and it is difficult to cope with ordinary days, so what leisure do I have to take them out? Thinking about it makes me shiver. But now I have no such worries at all, when the problems that cannot be solved exceed the power of a weak and sensitive emotion.</p>
<p>2.  Deep Drunkenness at Midnight</p>
<p>With the heart of a young man, but filled with grey thoughts that a young man should not have, and perhaps even mixed with the languid breath of an old man. So I have the appearance of premature aging. In front of people, I also have the same laughter and interest in seeking entertainment as ordinary people. But these are not things that I am willing to do. Everything in the world is estranged and lonely to me. This estrangement and loneliness are also what I am used to. I have many words hidden in my heart, but there is no one I can reveal them to, and no one who is qualified to be worth telling them to, so I like to think and meditate on the distant. Every night, I stagger out of the hotel drunk, walking on the cold and lonely sidewalk. Only half a person is seen every half day, which does not hinder my unbridled behavior. I open my throat and sing and whistle, and if there is a moon in the sky, the moon is my only companion. Then I walk slowly on the moonlight, and the song becomes more energetic. If I'm not tired, it doesn't matter if I walk until dawn, because my grievances have disappeared invisibly. When I'm so sad that I can't get rid of it, I have to sink into such a state, although after waking up, there will inevitably be a more unbearable bitterness, I understand, but the temporary intoxication is finally a pleasure. At that time, it is almost half dreaming: my body is immersed in the moonlit color like a melted silver liquid, and the stars are shining on my head. My mood is excited, as if there is nothing in the world that makes people depressed, and I forget everything, although occasionally a few fallen leaves are blown down by the wind and swim past my front, reporting a little autumn news to me, but I have no time to pay attention.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Fruit <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>There is a small round table in my room, with a plate on it, filled with fresh fruit—the sweet vegetables, the lovely fruit, the fruit that evokes longing.</p>
<p>When I am quiet, I often gaze at this agate-colored fruit plate in contemplation. This vegetable plate is a relic of our old family. It has witnessed the changes in this family—joy and sorrow, viewing and resentment, prosperity and decline—but it has always remained silent. Whenever fruit is on the market, different fruits will be pressed on its body by different hands. Now it is placed in this corner of the room, and whenever there is fruit, it will spread out a rich fragrance like flowers and trees. People who smell this fragrance will also feel as if they are in a fruit orchard with fragrant grass, beautiful flowers, and falling petals. The eternally fixed blue sky presents the peace of the universe, and the rich fruits match the joy of the people, making people unable to resist being fascinated by this realm. In imagination, there can be trees, ponds, and vegetable fruits swaying in the light red evening glow, or rolling on the green lawn, like yellow autumn leaves. Homeless birds come to peck at the half-green vegetable skins. When they carry them to mid-air, they fall down, sinking into the pond and disturbing the swimming fish coming and going... But when I open my eyes, it is still this small room, a pile of fruit quietly lying there, as if secretly laughing at your infatuation. In the dim twilight, a tone seems to come through: "Why don't you come and eat us? Shall we have a kiss?" The voice is like that of a beautiful young woman, and you can't help but turn your head back. When you turn your head back, there is nothing there. It is still the pile of fruit lying there motionless. The aged fruit plate is being pressed so hard that it can't breathe, stiff like an old woman carrying a heavy load.</p>
<p>There are yellow bananas, deep yellow and light red Florida oranges, purple or white half-ripe grapes, apples as plump as a seventeen-year-old girl, and peaches like fragrant courtesans. These are all mixed up, you pushing me and I squeezing you, lying in the plate. This kind of fresh, vibrant atmosphere forms a clear contrast with the ancient, powerless fruit plate. This pile sometimes looks even better than bottled flowers. In the soft light of the morning sun and in the green dim light of the night, there is such a poetic and hazy mood. I sometimes even want to pick up a pen and write a poem.</p>
<p>In order to satisfy my own appreciation, I can't bear to eat them. I feel that eating these lovely vegetables into my stomach, destroying the current decoration to satisfy my own appetite, is completely a discordant thing. Sometimes my hand has already stretched out, but I quietly withdraw it in a second thought. Once, all the fruit in the plate was rotten. With a feeling of cherishing, I threw them away and replaced them with a plate of exquisite crabapple fruit. They are all red, the sisters of cherries, the sisters of apples and vegetables, slender and withered green leaves, just like warm hair, diligently protecting the shy face. Once, my index finger moved, cruelly gnawing at her rosy cheeks and swallowing the sweet nectar of life into my stomach. The taste is very sour, a taste of love, a taste of wine, and with a touch of nostalgic sadness.</p>
<p>Now the crabapples in the plate are almost eaten up by me. I hope to go to the market tomorrow and buy some more lovely fruits. I can't let the plate be empty. Thinking of this, such brilliant colors appear in front of me again, and gentle or splashing colors fill my surroundings. I really hope that I can leave the market that I have to go to every day and run to the suburban vegetable and fruit orchard, sit under a big tree to read a book or smoke a cigarette, listen to the fish jumping in the pond, and easily pluck off a slightly green fruit, eating it while running over the hill to see the porcelain-like fields, and watch the big, red, tangerine-shaped sun at dusk...</p>

<h3 id="e183">Zhaoshang Inn <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>Like the inns in ordinary small towns, they used "Zhaoshang Inn" as their signboard. But after so many merchants were attracted, the bald-headed innkeeper and the insomniac-like waiter were a little overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The dozen or so wooden tables were all full, and the ground was covered with water brought in. The waiter was already a bit clumsy, and this made it even more awkward for him to walk. He first handed out a wooden basin and several towels to each table, and then asked the customers one by one what dishes they wanted to eat. At this time, the innkeeper came to greet them. He was already covered in sweat, as if he had just crawled out of the stove. Some of the customers who had stayed overnight in Liuniao Bay asked the innkeeper to bring out some good wine first. So the innkeeper opened his broken bamboo throat: "There are only about a dozen jars of aged Huadiao wine in the inner room, and there are dozens of piles of top-quality white rice, but..." The innkeeper narrowed his eyes, looked up at the sky and laughed, showing his full-fledged philistine air. Then he gave a wink at the noisy crowd and said, "I'm really sorry, there's no place to buy fresh side dishes. Gentlemen, please help me with this, just so-so."</p>
<p>He laughed again, naturally drawing laughter from our group.</p>
<p>During the meal, people who didn't know each other became familiar. After everyone filled their stomachs, they thought of the clothes that had been soaked by the rain. The Zhaoshang Inn was quite like the northern style. With a shout from everyone, the insomniac-like waiter had already prepared charcoal basins for us under the direction of the bald-headed innkeeper. At this time, everyone's flushed faces were overflowing with a slight tipsiness. They all stripped off their wet clothes, as if they were on a snowy winter night, sitting around the fire basin, opening their clothes, and watching the water vapor being evaporated by the flames rise. For a moment, everyone sank into sweet memories, letting time pass quickly.</p>
<p>The heavy rain outside was still hitting the roof like thunder. I knew that everyone could clearly hear it: but under this almost Arabian Nights situation, no one wanted to think of the pain or loss caused by being blocked by the rain, which would cause this group to be unhappy, and even break the pleasure that everyone was quietly enjoying. The innkeeper and the waiter didn't know when they had hidden in the kitchen. When that steaming bald head reappeared before our eyes, his philistine laughter was like a sharp arrow, resonating in the wide dining hall.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, would you like some strong tea?" As he said this, he stepped aside, and behind his huge pig-like body, the waiter was already holding a large tray with both hands, with a dozen cups of almost black strong tea steaming like the bald head. "It's raining heavily outside. I'm afraid the boat won't be able to sail tomorrow!" Then, of course, there was another series of laughter that made people frown.</p>
<p>After he said this, the huge sound of rain seemed to be sent into everyone's ears more clearly, but did you want to get angry at the innkeeper? He was like a cunning fox, stretching and shrinking his head, and so diligently delivering cups of tea to each guest. A businessman would never forget his business philosophy no matter what.</p>
<p>The water vapor on the clothes gradually thinned out. While we were silently drinking tea, exhaustion slowly climbed into everyone's heart. The innkeeper was as astute as ever. He was holding the candle and waiting for our instructions.</p>

<p>Year after year, disasters do not cease, the disaster victims everywhere are heartbroken, natural disasters and man-made disasters, water and fire are raging, so the Yangtze River and the Yellow River are full of disaster victims, they are.

Travelers fleeing through the rivers and lakes, some are. Vagrants living in the city, some are. Wives and children separated, wailing and crying, some are. No houses, no places to settle down, some are, sobbing and weeping, telling about the disaster situation, some are. Crying for help, some are, even more. Calling for brothers, looking for double observatories, seeking husband and wife; looking for children and grandchildren, abandoning their families, leaving their lovers, and even more. The tragic deaths of people drowning on the spot, the most pitiful. Confined in the great water all day long, they will get sick even if they avoid drowning, eating tree bark, biting grass roots, selling wives and daughters, selling children and grandchildren, these are all.

<p>The Jinan Morality Maintenance Association, in order to investigate the customs of various places, took a group of staff members, led by the chairman - Kang Fuchi, on a long march to Shanghai. During the time when the chairman went out to visit guests, the staff members of the association actually did what they called knowingly breaking the law, destroying moral behavior, flirting with the actress - Yi Qing and her daughter. At this unexpected time, the chairman actually came back, and at a loss for a solution, they hid the actress and her daughter behind the screen. The chairman, seeing a piece of women's clothing, treated his staff members with a kind face. At that moment, Yi Qing and her daughter came out from behind the screen, and his - the chairman's decades of morality, was all in vain.</p>

<p>Han Xiaomei delivered the silver lamp to the door of the study. She secretly thought that there were distant guests today. She slowed her lotus steps and looked inside. She saw Han Leyu and Li Shoubai sitting in front of the window, talking and laughing. She deliberately avoided showing her face and placed the lamp on the table inside. She stepped back and gave Shoubai a quick glance, a young gentleman who was very elegant. She couldn't help but admire him privately. Han Leyu was about to call Xiaomei to perform the first meeting ceremony. Xiaomei suddenly thought about preparing dinner in the kitchen and returned from the study. She looked in the kitchen. Apart from the usual home-cooked dishes, there was nothing special to entertain the guests. As she was thinking, she suddenly heard a rooster crowing. This rooster had a tall crown, a majestic appearance, and beautiful feathers, and it was Han Leyu's favorite thing in his life. Because Xiaomei had no special ingredients, she instructed Er Tu to slaughter it to entertain the honored guests.</p>

<p>This city's Midnight Music Society, responding to the invitation of the New World Amusement Congress, specially convened a general meeting to resolve to join various events, which has been reported in previous newspapers. In recent days, Mr. Xu Ruhui, the organizer of the association, has been working separately and is very excited. He has also discussed with movie stars such as Xia Peizhen and Gu Lanjun to participate in singing. Other young ladies such as Yu Jingqiu and Bai are also willing to participate in the grand event. Therefore, the training has been progressing very smoothly in recent days. It is said that Mr. Xu has composed a song for the Emerald Horse of the Star Film Company and plans to specially invite Gu Lanjun to sing the lead role on that day (the song is called "Down in the Qionglou"). In addition, the society's ancient music ensemble will play ancient music in a new tune, which will surely shine brightly. It is said that the society will move to a new address at No. 7 Shouchang Lane, Fangbang Bridge, French Concession, on September 1 and will continue to operate as usual.</p>
<p>Musician Yang Zengshu, in view of the declining state of domestic music and singing, recently planned to run a singing society independently, hoping to work hard to reform and completely eliminate past mistakes, so as to promote and glorify the spirit of our people. It is said that it has been named Yang Guang Music and Singing Society. Most of the members are his acquaintances and former students. Mr. Yang is personally providing new guidance and intensifying training, so as to make it perfect and fully meet people's expectations. Once the preparations are complete, there will be special contributions, which are not only a good sign for the music and singing industry, but also a future ear blessing for radio listeners. (Gold and Silver)</p>

<p>"Hero of the Times" to Start Filming Early</p>
<p>Hu Ping was sick for a while some time ago. Although her plump apple-colored face was a little thinner, her beauty did not diminish in the slightest.</p>
<p>According to Hu Ping herself: "The origin of my illness this time is nothing more than overwork, because I was filming 'Hero of the Times' directed by Ying Yunwei at Yihua, and I had to go to Xinhua to film 'The Peach Blossom Fan' at the same time. Sometimes I was filming day and night, and I didn't have enough rest, which led to the illness." Indeed, it is hard enough to film in this hot weather.</p>
<p>Hu Ping is from Hunan. She left her hometown and her beloved parents to come to this Shanghai, thousands of miles away, to be a soldier in Chinese film culture. It has been more than three years. In these three years, Hu Ping has always wanted to return to her hometown once to see her dear parents, but her ideal has never been realized.</p>
<p>Recently, her father came to Shanghai to see her, not fearing the arduous journey. When the father and daughter, who had been separated for more than three years, met, you can imagine what a moving scene it was, full of both sadness and joy!</p>
<p>Her father told her that her mother's old illness had relapsed and was extremely dangerous. She missed her all day long. Hu Ping's heart was shattered when she heard about her mother's condition, and tears couldn't help but fall down.</p>
<p>Now, Hu Ping has decided to ask Yihua Film Company for a month's leave to return to Hunan to visit her mother. The trip will be in about two weeks. As for the unfinished scenes in "Hero of the Times," she has obtained the consent of director Ying Yunwei to start filming early.</p>

<p>"Mother" was screened at the Star Grand Theatre the other day. The sound recording is the best in Chinese films.</p>
<p>Each primary school in Shanghai has even included the song "Mother" in the music curriculum.</p>
<p>Ge Furong wrote an "Imitation Collection" for "Mercury Lamp."</p>
<p>Li Yihe wrote a letter saying that he had arrived in Tokyo safely and was very busy investigating the Japanese film industry in recent days.</p>

<p>Xinhua Film Company's production of "The Peach Blossom Fan" had a guessing game. Those who guessed correctly would receive a Peach Blossom Fan painted by Zhang Yuguang and could request a signature from a certain celebrity. Unexpectedly, people from all walks of life were very interested in this and speculated one after another, with more than 100,000 letters reaching them. After the announcement, each star wrote their names. There were so many that the procedure became very busy. In particular, many people asked for signatures from Ouyang Yuqian, Jin Yan, Hu Ping, Zhang Zhiyun, and Tong Yuejuan. Jin Yan liked to use a fountain pen and drank beer while signing. Some called it a drunken signature. Jin Yan smiled at it. Hu Ping's handwriting was extremely charming, while Ouyang's handwriting was strong and vigorous. Others, such as Zhang Zhiyun's magnificence and Tong Yuejuan's generosity, were all regarded as treasures by those who obtained them. Others, such as Dai Yanwan, Gu Menghu, Zhang Zhizhi, Zhou Fengwen, and Zha Tianying, each signed hundreds of them and were very busy.</p>
