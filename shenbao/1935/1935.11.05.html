<p>各經濟學家之意見</p>
<p>（南京）陳長蘅談、政府此次對貨幣之緊急措施、確較其他關於改善中國幣制之一切主張切實而有效、個人在兩年前卽有此　議、故對政府此次措施、異常贊成、按此項辦法、旣非通貨膨服、亦非紙幣政策、乃係對通貨實施統制、卽所謂通貨管理、惟個人尙有意見數點貢獻政府採納、（一）我國貨幣異常紊亂、此項辦法公布以後、當可收統一之效、惟我國幣制雖亂、向以兌現爲原則、現我國援世界各國例、以國家銀行所發紙幣爲法幣、停化兌現、人民必感受驚訝、爲使人民了解此項汁幣有十足準備、發行準備管理委員會之組織、應再將農會工會代表及純粹財政學者參加在內、以期取信於人民、（二）此後法幣發行額、應有預算、不可濫發、免陷通貨膨脹危險、尤　能利用貨幣數量說、以安定物價、卽迪貨發行應隨貿易盛衰而伸縮、（三）法幣因可無限制買賣外匯、故與國際貿易息息相關、深盼在經營外匯中、對無需要之進口貨物、應設法附帶限制、（四）收集民間之生銀銀幣、應鑄成廠條、存入準備庫、準備庫更應分設全國、以期安全而昭信實、（四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）經濟學家趙蘭坪談、余五月間著中國經濟金融財政之根本自救方案、主張放棄銀本位、並擬詳細辦法、今所行者與該文暗合、放棄銀本位、確爲救治目下經濟困難之根本辦法、况最近我國貨幣、巳非純粹銀本位制、今由政府明令放棄、實爲應有行動、對一般經濟金融、决無不良影響、今後我國經濟金融恐慌、當可逐漸消滅、國家稅收、例如關稅因金單位上漲、必漸增加統稅印花稅、亦必因經濟復興、收入較多、經常歲出入可漸趨平衡、故無增發紙幣膨脹通貨之必要、至於物價、必稍　貴、此勝防止、故工商界與政府須通力合作、至今後幣制、應由現行之紙本位制、直接改成對外用金對內用紙之紙本位制、始可永脫銀價之束縛、現銀國有以後應相機出售、易成現金與金匯、以充正貨準備、故如美積極抬高銀價、反於我有利、（四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）財政專家劉振東供獻意見、謂（一）撥銀用紙統制貨幣、必須有嚴密之行政組織、（二）關於貨幣　供給需求問題、必有精密之研究與準備、而輔幣問題更爲重要、（三）集中現銀方法及保管地點、亦應研究、（四）奸人偸運私家窖藏如何防止、（五）宵小造謠奸商操縱、應如何取締、以免金融界騷亂、及物價騰貴、（四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）許仕廉四日下午偕美財長顧問布安等赴各鄉村調查對貨幣實言之態度、據談、鄉間商舖以本少現銀流通、認爲如政府多發紙幣且有信用、則交易必更可活動、農民生產困難、亦可减少、（四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）許仕廉談、（一）緊急法令可停止通貨緊縮、（二）政府統制國外匯兌、國際貿易發達、國內工商業因之振興、（三）全國財政經濟狀况及管理可以改善、（四）無限購買政策將來益有利益（五）此種政策幷非通貨膨脹、但可免通貨緊縮、（四日中央社電）</p>

<h3 id="c4">中小學課程標準之修訂 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 秉</p>
<p>日前敎育部聘集專家。開中小學課程標準討論會。自中小學課程標準頒行以來迄今已及三年。實施者據其經騐。觀察者憑其識力。咸感覺有斟酌修訂期臻於至善之必要。敎部召開斯會。動機正復相同。融衆見於一爐。惟善謀之是從。其重視敎育之至意。良可感佩。而斯會結果之不容忽視。自屬當然之事。</p>
<p>查斯會議題。對於中小學均有擬訂各科敎授細目一項。此誠至要。足補前此之疎漏。前此標準中祇有大綱要目。編輯敎科書者各憑意會。難免互有出入。試取各家所出敎科書觀之。同言依據課程標準編輯。而同一科目之書。詳略迴殊。取舍各異。實施者或不採用敎科書。而自定敎授細目。亦復與編輯敎科書相同。以己意斟酌其間。不免與大綱要目多少違異。坐此之故。中小學生之所受者。視所用敎科書所遇敎師而異其質量。程度於是參差。知能因而懸殊。今後旣訂定各科敎授細目。則編輯者與實施者咸有共守之準繩。將使中小學生之所受者。無論在何地何校。質量無有不齊。程度參差知能懸殊之弊。庶幾可以免除。雖敎授細目之妥善與否尙不可知。而今此擬訂各科敎授細目之决議。要爲更進一步之措置。値得我人讚許者也。</p>
<p>斯會對於高中算學一科。决議於二年級分組。令性近理科者多習算學。性近文科者則减少算學時數而多習國文外國語等科。按高中算學之使學生不勝負擔。久爲一般人所稱說。而算學成績之不見優良。亦爲共覩之事實。自陳衡哲女士在大公報發表「救救中學生」一文。文中所舉事例。大多爲算學功課之繁重影響及學生身體之健康。於是留心敎育者尤注意於算學科之質量問題。我人之意。學生身體之健康與否。繫於整個之敎育設施。不能徒歸咎於一二科目之繁重。卽就算學功課之令學生頭疼腦脹而言。敎法之未盡完善當爲至大之因素。亦不宜遽議及算學科本身之質與量。今此决議。不蔑視算學對於整個敎育之重要性。祇事增减其問。俾學生各就所近。爲能力所及之發展。又無從前顯分文科理科過於一偏之弊。其爲明達者贊同。可以斷言。惟分組以後。敎法之改進仍屬急不容緩。否則分組之效難見。訾議之聲將繼起也。</p>
<p>又有一重要决議。爲小學低年級中年級衛生自然社會合併爲常識科。其用意在使有系統。而我人尤讚許其深得綜合敎學之旨。夫兒童驟入學校。本其夙具之經騐。惟知有一件件一樁樁之事物。初無分科之觀念。而覩敎師所指示之日課表。受敎師所授與之敎科書。乃名目繁多。難以遽憶。及習各科。則析一件件一樁樁之事物而爲數部。一部過之於甲科。又一部則遇之於乙科。其不適應兒童之素習。不待敎育專家而始知之。今將衛生自然社會合併爲常識科。向之得以如是者。今則改爲一律如是。至高年級。始爲分科以專兒童學習觀念。蓋先之以綜合。斯適應兒童之素習。繼之以分析。則啟導研究之軌途。用意至爲美善。惟我人猶有欲言者。常識科之目標在實際經騐之獲得。最好能廢棄敎科書而代之以親身歷練。實地觀察。每見小學校中。衛生有書。自然有書。社會又有書。其於敎學。不出解釋語句。寫作筆記之範圍。是科名雖各殊。而實際俱爲國語之附庸。縱有實益。爲量亦僅矣。以出版爲業之書局固利在有敎科書。耽於疎嫩之敎師亦利在有敎科書。敎科書豈眞敎學上必要之工具耶。方今修訂課程標準之際。此一點値得一考慮也。</p>
<p>對於中小學女生。又决議增加家事敎育。此若認爲勞作之一項目。當然無可非議。其他决議。似屬次要。今姑不論。通體觀之。斯會之結果。對於前此課程標準。確有較善之補訂。是可喜也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）英國報紙今日以大字登載中政府貨幣改革之辦法、金融時報稱、中政府此舉、在各方面適合西方最佳制度、誠爲良好决斷、又稱、此種計書之成功、槃於行此計畫者之德性與始終一致、但可無疑者、中國當可覓得辦理此項計畫之人物、俾獲得信任、而開中國金融穩定之新時代、該報末稱、英國與他國定予以最誠摯之贊助與合作云、每日電聞稱、此種金融改革之堅决而遠大的計畫、定爲對華貿易之各國商界所贊成、且將展開中國商業之偉大前途云、晨郵報稱、中政府在實際上現宣布中國脫離白銀、此種决議快刀斬麻、當局勢危急時誠宜如此、度其用意、殆欲使華幣不脫離對英鎊之現有關係、但紙幣將以何種準備與何種基金爲根據、而中國人民將有何種反響、此乃難以忖度之問題、英國將以同情與盼望其成功之希望注視此種大嘗試云、（四日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c51">阿比西尼亞的國情 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 昂若</p>
<p>——種族·政治·軍備——</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞是封建的古國。全國人民差不多都是文盲，道路實際上沒幾條，每年的對外貿易不到美金二千五百萬元。阿比西尼亞本族統治着許多藩族，屬於古阿比西尼亞族的，大槪不過全部人口三分之一，其餘旣不信奉某督敎，也不操阿姆哈立克語。阿比西尼亞本族居住在中部高原，藩族則棲息於周圍低窪之地。全部人口約數很難確定，一般估計自五百萬至二千萬不等，熟悉阿此西尼亞國情的考據家估定在七八百萬之間。可是關於阿比西尼亞的任何統計都是很少，並且全不可靠。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞帝國種族複雜的人民，可用幾種方法來檢別。體格上的特徵最難依據。阿比西尼亞本族自認屬於白種人，爲北菲含族的後裔。這是不錯的，但與中菲東菲的黑人幾千年的接觸已把他們的膚色染成咖啡色，甚至於像深黑的朱古律色了。</p>
<p>語言爲檢別民族較爲可靠的標準。中部高原的人民說的是閃族語。中部迤南居住着加拉族，屬黑種人，有他們自己的語言，是近代初期從南方移殖而來的。他們也佔全人口的三分之一。其餘的三分之一分成若干小部落，散居於達那基爾，索馬里，西達馬等邊省。根據此種語言的分別，我們可以說高原的（閃族的）三分之一統治着低原的（非閃族的）三分之二。</p>
<p>宗敎也是一個檢別民族的方法。阿比西尼亞本族是基督敎徒，但是加拉人之中至少在名義上也有皈依基督敎的。某督敎徒的總數約佔全人口之半。回敎徒佔八分之三，居住於東部及東南部。此外還有法拉夏敎徒——阿比西尼亞的猶太敎徒——約一二十萬人，他們的猶太敎義很腐敗，也不懂希伯來語。其餘的人是無宗敎的。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞的基督敎徒屬於古埃及敎會。總主敎是亞力山大利亞的大敎長所委，常是埃及人充任的。阿皇很想以本地人代替，但是阿比西尼亞國內的習慣却不容易打破，所以只得另設本地主敎若干人以爲輔弼而已。牧師甚多，有人說佔成年人口的三分之一。這固然言過其實，但在靜止的社會（如西藏）抱出世觀念的人數必超出敎會的所需。阿比西尼亞的牧師富有地產。他們不學無術，且頗迷信。他們遂造成一種很大的守舊勢力。一千五百年來，阿比西尼亞能保持獨立，宗敎是一種很大的力量。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞帝國是現時封建國家的最好的典型。它境內的社會以層層疊疊嚴格的階級爲基礎，每一階級有它的傳縱的經濟政治機能。社會組織的基礎以軍事爲主體。戰時能率師抗敵的是國家千城，受國家無上的榮譽。在承平之時，這類軍人就是治理國事的官員，幾世紀來，這種制度流傳着並無多大變遷。在十九世紀末葉以前，阿比西尼亞是與外界隔絕的。不過在十六世紀，曾受葡萄牙人一度侵犯，爲時也甚暫。到了梅納立克朝（梅納立克皇帝薨於一九一三年），西方文明又侵入阿比西尼亞。不過直至今日，這種勢力僅及於國王左右，雖經國王竭力維新，仍舊是食古不化的。</p>
<p>今皇海利塞拉西厲行尊君集權制。在過去，除非國君強有力如梅納立克，四方諸侯常想妄自尊大，而不受他們名義上的君主節制。因爲地域遼遠多山，地方觀念發達，爾慮我詐，常使孱弱的元首難於統治。今皇的集權運動已收穫了很大的成就。若干世襲的諸侯已經就範，不受首都方面監督的，多由國王更易了。</p>
<p>梅納立克薨後，解體的君權現在逐漸恢復，這種運對在一九二六年因大元帥斐沃斐斯之死而急轉直下。斐沃斐斯統率國軍三十年，一旦逝世，皇太子泰法利將軍（卽今皇）乘千載一時之機，攫取他的封邑，接管他的軍權，與自己世襲的哈拉爾省軍隊合併，一躍而爲阿比西尼亞最有權力的親王。他雷厲風行的昭吿與他一樣有權承繼皇位的諸侯，表示他大權獨攬的决心。一九二八年女皇柴蝶都（梅納立克之女）封他爲王。一九三〇年女皇薨，他登了皇位，國號海利塞拉西。一九三二年，一向獨立的高特迦省海魯將軍叛變，國王舉兵把他討平。於是位於藍尼羅河套內最重要的富庶之區也歸中央政府管轄了。不過就大體論，世襲的諸侯還沒有把他們的封邑廢止，集權運動僅以東部和南部的邊省爲限，那面的人民多是回敎徒或無宗敎的，七地也到梅納立克朝才征服的，所以還沒有時間同化呢。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞自然也有憲法，是一九三一年欽定頒佈的。憲法也規定「國會」須定期開會。這「國會」不能與歐美民治國家的立法機關相提並論，是無待費辭的。所謂「代議士」對於立法行政也無力行施監督權。他們的任期完全受國王的支配。這「國會」只能算做登記　。國王如有諭旨要使國內外週知，他就親臨這一國會」宣布。這種國會議員不能算楚代表阿比西尼亞無智的羣衆，充其量，他們只可算是代表諸侯罷。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>因然阿比西尼亞是個封建國家，卽使强有力的國王也不得不依靠諾侯的合作，才得抵禦外侮。在理論上，阿比西尼亞每個兵士都須效忠國王，實際上並不盡然。國王高高在上，政府權力尙未完全集中。兵士只受諸侯的節制。諸侯雖不的叛變，他們仍可以消極的抵抗來破壞中央的計盡。</p>
<p>近來屢傳邊境酋長頗多投降意軍的事情，但這不能沒有相當條件的。這種收買阿此西尼亞藩族的勾當在過去是無往而不失敗的。十九世紀末頁，意人暗助沙亞王梅納立克以抗國王喬恒宜斯。一八八九年喬恒宜斯薨，梅納立克接位，就厲行反意政策了。此後意相克禮斯比想敎唆北方藩族叛變，但是阿杜華一役，北方諸侯無不爲梅納立克效力，大敗意軍。這是歷史上顯著的實例。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞的軍隊是一種落伍的武力，如其沒有地勢險阻爲天然的屏障，要保持國家的獨立，恐怕很難。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞的禁衛軍是唯一新式的隊伍，兵力約在二千五百人至三萬之間。自一九二九年以來，這支軍隊由比利時和瑞典軍官訓練。他們穿着制服，赤着足，荷帶新式軍器，依照軍事學操演。這支軍隊可說是勁旅，非至緊要關頭，阿皇是不願把他們開赴前敵的。</p>
<p>禁衛軍之外，阿皇還有他自己指揮的皇軍，是他轄境之內的武裝臣民編成的。今皇的轄境包括哈拉爾，胡洛，及沙亞三省。這些皇軍分駐各地，担任警備，並且執行諭旨。皇軍的人數沒有確實的統計，大槪在五萬人至十萬人之間。這種軍隊在別國只能算做雜色軍。他們的軍備和編制都很舊式。</p>
<p>諸侯的徵兵也是一樣的舊式。凡是壯丁皆須從軍。惟憎侶，牧師，商賈，牧羊者，貴婦的衛士可以免去軍役，將來人丁减少了，這些人必有取消免役資格的一日。</p>
<p>阿皇可以調動的軍隊的實數，論者不一其辭，有人說動員的已有一百萬人。這恐怕是說得過分。在役的人或有此數，但全體動員，給養和軍器兩俱不足，於軍事上有弊無利。所以動員五十萬人大槪比較近情。愛立特利亞前任總督　石禮估計阿比西尼亞能調到前綫的軍隊至多不出二十五萬人。在蒂格里省，給養困難，阿比西尼亞如欲集中大軍，那是不智的。；</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞的軍備也是一樣難於統計，大槪有各式步槍五六十萬支，機關槍數百架，大砲數十尊，所謂大砲大槪也只是博物院裏的陳列品。雖有幾架飛機，但不能爲作戰之用。瓦斯設備，坦克車隊，以及現代戰術的種種利器，當然是沒有的。</p>
<p>軍備方面，阿比西尼亞雖遠不敵意軍，然而它有幾點是處於優勢的。第一，他們得地之利。第二，他們作戰熟悉地勢。第三，他們的行動比較敵方便利。歐洲軍部所認爲不可缺少的補助隊，如輜重隊和救護隊之類，他們都無此需要。阿比西尼亞軍隊進行無需多帶糧餉，他們可以隨地就食。這在速戰上是很便利的。久慣歐洲生活的意軍是吃不來菲洲人的糧食的，所以非帶足笨重的軍需不可。阿軍沒有前方醫院或後方醫院，包紮創口統須隨軍出發的婦女僕役帮助自己動手的。</p>
<p>如作持久戰，這種活動上的優勢就失掉價値。就地徵發的糧食快要吿罄，各地徵集的軍隊的勇氣也要隨之衰竭。况且，阿比西尼亞人對離鄉背井好幾個月是不願意的。他們對於雨季從軍尤感不快。他們所希望的是一戰而勝。敵軍一日被擊敗，他們就四散回鄉，不再戀戀於乘勝進取了。一八七五年埃及軍在岡特和古拉之敗，和一八九六年意軍在阿杜華之敗，都是這樣戛然而止的。這次戰事，阿比西尼亞人如其仍是這樣老脾氣，那末，雨季一到，我們會看見數十萬意軍駐紮阿比西尼亞山中，而不見阿軍與之爲敵了。然而墨索里尼還有種種顧慮，他的軍事行動也不能曠日持久的。（節RcbertGajcWoolbert論文）</p>

<p>— 立法院委員林彬</p>
<p>（十月三十日及十月一日對全國民衆講）</p>
<p>（四）人民依法應享的權利</p>
<p>什麼呌做權利呢。權利乃是法律爲特定的人，因充實其所認許之利益，而付與之力。如分兩方面講。權利的內容，是法律上所認許之利益。權利的外形，是法律上所付與之力。有此法律上之力，才能貫澈主張，得到法律上之利益。人民享有的權利，種類繁多，其中最重要的，是在憲法中規定，各國憲法？大抵相同，憲法上對於人民權利的規定，有僅爲限制行政權及司法權而設，以防其侵害人民的，有僅爲限制立法權而設，以防其侵害人民的，多數國家的憲法條文，有所謂「人民之自由非依法律不很限制。」有所謂「人民於法律範圍內有某種之自由。」此等文字，均爲限制行政權及司法權而設，因爲制定法律，是立法機關的權限，立法機關，如未制定某種法律以限制人民的權利。行政機關或司法機關，就無所依據。不得以命令或裁判，任意限制人民的權利，美國憲法，一七九一年追加條文，有所謂「議會不很制定法律，以限制言論，出版，集會，請願等權，］中華民國憲法草案第二十五條，所載」凡限制人民權利自由之法律，以保障國家安全，避免緊急危難，維持社會秩序，或增進公共利益所必要者爲限，」此等文字，均爲限制立法權而設。因爲立法機關，雖有制定法律之權，而人民之某項自由權權利沒有限制的必要，亦不得任意制定法律以限制之。行政機關，司法機關，或立法機關，如有違反此等規定之情事的時候。其所制定的法律，應爲無效，其所爲以處分或裁判，應予以撤銷，人民方面，因此所受之員害，又可衣據法律，請求賠價，所謂權利受憲法的保障，就是這個意思。中華民國訓政時期約法，及立法院所擬憲法草案，規定人民基本的權利，可以分爲以下的數種。</p>
<p>一，平等權，就是中華民國人民無男女種族宗敎階級之區別，在法律上一律平等。平等的意義，以上已講過了。</p>
<p>二，自由權，就是人民的身體，財產，言論等自由，不得在法律所定的範圍以外而受干涉之權利，人民之身體，非依法律，不得逮捕、拘禁，審問，或處罰，這是身體的自由，設有法律根據而爲逮捕，拘禁等處分，或雖有法律而不依其所定之程序以爲處分，均屬違法的處分，有此違法處分的公務員，應負懲戒法上，刑法上，及民法上的責任。人民之居住處所，非依法律不得侵入搜索或對銅，這是居住的自法，譬如檢察官或司法警察，如果搜索人民住宅，或封閉其住宅，應依據刑事訴訟法，及其他關係法規辦理，倘有違反，即是侵害人民自由，也應該負懲戒，刑事及民事上之責任。人民之遷徙，非依法律，不得限制。這是遷徙的自由。人民因爲生活上的必要，應該許其自由移轉，方能達到圓滿的目的，如有必要情形，始得依據法律予以限制。譬如爲防止傳染，依照法規禁止傳染病人的遷徙，就是一個例子。人民信仰宗敎。非依法律不得限制。這是信敎的目的。信敎自由，本來含有信仰自由，與信仰行爲自由兩種意思。單純的信仰，屬於心理的作用，不能由外部加以强制，旣不能强其信仰，亦不能强其不信仰，如係信仰行爲，如做禮拜及傳布敎義等行爲，原則上亦有自由，但是如果借傳敎爲名，而有擾亂社會妨害風俗的時候，國家自然可以干涉，若說宗敎信仰，有絕對自由，絕對不受法律限制，那是未免誤解，所以憲法草案的文字，與約法稍微有點出入。人民的言論著作及出版，非依法律，不得限制，這是言論著作出版的自由，言論是指演說，講話，辯論等而言。著作是指文書圖畫等製作而言，出版是指文書圖畫等之印刷發行而言，這三樣都是人類發表思想的方法。思想是促成文明發展社會的要具，應該承認人民各有思想的自由。不過言論著作出版，如有妨害公共秩序危害國家等情事，亦可加以限制。所以刑法危害民國緊急洽罪法及出版法上，就有限制的明文，人民秘密通信，非依法律不得限制，這是秘密通信的自由·通信是指用電報，電話，書函等方法來表示意思。秘密是指不願意他人知道，或不願意多數人知道，較爲有利的情形。人民如用通信方法表示意思，並願守其秘密，在國家方面，實無可以干涉的理由·不過爲防衛國家社會之利益起見，有時可以依法加以限制·例如依照戒嚴法來檢查郵電，依照刑事訴訟法來檢查犯罪人的書信，依照破產法來檢查破產人的書信等，都是合法的。人民的集會結社，非依法律，不得限制。這是集會結社的自由，集會是指多數人的暫時集合，結社是指多數人的永久團體。多數人的思想，因集全而交換，而折衷，而表現，確實對共同生活上有重要的關係，個人的思想，用言論會結社方法來表示，旣然許其自由了，那末集會結社，無非是爲匯合起來表示人民的思想，亦不得不許其自由，集會，結社，有有政治上的目的，有沒有政治上的目的。各國法律對於有政治上目的的集會結社，往往有較嚴的限制。我們中國，現在訓政時期，集會結社，必須先得當地黨部的許可，必須遵照人民團體組織方案的規定，必須不觸犯刑法及危害民國緊急治罪法之規定。至於警察，因爲維持治安的目的，可以加以監督，那是不消說了。人民之財產非依法律不得查對沒收，這是財產的自由，財產是人民生活物質的資料，不問是財產上何項利，均不得加以非法的干涉。縱令查封或，也要有法律上的根據，例如依照土地徵收法來徵收人民的土地，依照刑法來沒收人民的財產，才是合法的處分，此外還有工作選擇的自由，契約訂立的自由，非依法律，亦不得加以限制。以上是自由權分析的說明。</p>
<p>三，受益權　受益權是人民從國家享受特別利益的權利，以享受利益爲目的，可以要求國家爲一定的行爲，是積極的，不是消極的，所以與白由權不同，自由權是消極的僅僅是要求國家不加干涉的權利，如果僅有消極的權利，，無而積極的請求國家爲某種行爲之權利，那末所謂自由權，恐怕實際上難得保護，所以各國憲法，都有關於受益權的規定。</p>
<p>受益權的範圍，各國規定不同，就大體上講，可分四種。一種是司法上的受益權。例如民事訴訟，刑事訴訟之權，依據訴訟程序法的規定，向司法機關提起訴訟。司法機關就不得不予以審理。一種是行政上的受益權，例如提起行政訴訟地起訴願，或爲請願之權，公務員的處分，如係違法損害人民的權利，人民可以提起訴願，經過訴願而仍有不服，可以提起行政訴訟。至於國家政治的設施，人民方面，亦可對於國家陳述其願望，這就呌做請願。一種是敎育上的受益權。教育的機會，凡屬人民一律平等。巳達學齡的兒童，有要求免費受敎育的權利，失學的人民，有要求受補習敎育的權利，他如私立學校可以請求獎勵與補助，學校敎職員，可以請求獎勵與保障，都是敎育方面，可得享受的利益，又一種是經濟上的受益權。例如貧苦的人民，有受救卹之權，勞動的人民，有受特別保護之權。特種實業，有受獎勵保護之權，都是人民在生計方面，可由國家保護的權利。</p>
<p>四，參政權參政權是人民參與國家政治的權利，與其他的權利，僅僅爲個人利益而行使者不同。一方面稱爲參政的權利，一方面又可稱爲參政的義務。參政權的種類，多數國憲法上規定，僅有選舉權及官吏兩種。依照我國國民政府建國大綱所載，人民除考試權外，倘有四種參政權，一選舉權，二罷免權，三創制權，四複决權，就是四種政權，須在憲法頒布之後，公民才能完全行使，選舉權在人民參政權中古主要的地位。對於人民代表機關的人員，可以選舉。對於行政的人員，可以選舉，就是最高行政元首，亦須由人民選舉出來。因爲有選舉權，所以民主政治的精神，才能實現。罷免權是人民對於國家機關的議員，或官吏可以直接撤回，與選舉權相輔而行，對於所選出的議員或官吏，如認爲有違法溺職的時候，就可依照法定程序罷免了他·因爲人民有了此種權利，所以政府的人員，就不可以不　職·就不得不忠實的代表民意，以謀人民的利益。創制權是人民得依公意　　某種法律或變更廢止某種法律之權·人民認爲辦理某事，非有某種良好法律不可，就得依據公意，創訂法律，人民認爲某種法律有害於人民的利益，就得依據公意，變更或廢止該種法律。此種造法廢法之權。叫做創制權，複决權是人民對於立法機關的法律案，加以表决之權，如經人民可决，法律始得成立。這與創制權不同。不在創造法律，而在批准法律，立法機關的法律案，那些不要人民複決，那些必須經過人民複决，其範圍以法律定之。凡治理一國的政事，不能祗有治人而無治法。以上講的選舉罷免兩權，是求「治人」的方法。　制複決兩權，是求有「治法」的方法，法良意美，其詳細的說明，可以參考孫中山先生關於政權的演講。</p>
<p>考試權是人民得應考試之權，國家耀行考試，原爲拔取人才，使從率於公務，凡是具有一定資格的人民，都得應試，應試權也就是自己願意充當政府的人員之權，與前講的四種政權，雖同爲參政權，而實有不同。前講的四種政權，乃是管理政府之權。應試權不過是志願取得官吏資格爲政府中一分子的權利而已。</p>
<p>人民的權利，在憲法中有明之規定的，大致如此。以下再講人民應盡的義務。</p>
<p>（五）人民依法應盡的義務，</p>
<p>人民是國家搆成的分子，爲完成國家之目的起見，當然不能單享權利而不負　務。人民對於國家的義務，範圍如何，因時代而有不同，在從前個人自由主義時代，憲法偏重僩人權利之保護，故所定人民義務之範圍，較爲狹小，後來法律觀念轉變，以社會利益之保護爲主。於是各國憲法中，亦把人民義務的範團，爲擴大的規定。中華民國訓政時期約法，中華民國憲法草案，對於人民義務亦有規定，可以分爲左列數種來講。</p>
<p>一，納稅的義務國家爲支付治則政事的費用，對於人民，有所徵取，這是當然的道埋。納稅的義務，就是人民對於國家負担費用的一種責任。資力厚的，納稅多些，資力薄的，納稅少些，仍與平等原則　符。人民惟在法律規定的範圍以內。才負納稅義務，法律未有規定的稅捐，便是雜稅，便是苛捐，不得謂之台法。</p>
<p>二，服兵役的義務即從事於兵役以捍衛國家的義務，國家興亡，匹夫　責，爲保持國家生存之目的起見，自須人民各負兵役。亦是國民皆兵之意。但是這是指採用徵兵制的國家而言。如果採募兵制。兵士均由招募而來，那末所謂國民當兵的義務未必就能實行。</p>
<p>三，服公役的義務所謂公役，包括公務，工役等在內，公務員的服公務，雖然是權利，但是亦可稱爲義務。如經合法委派，應該公而忘私，不得强行推諉。依據法律分派工役的時候，如修築馬路。開濬河道之類，人民亦有服從的義務。所謂祗有社會自由，沒有個人自由，就是這個意思。</p>
<p>四，服從官署行爲的義務國家官署，合法執行職務的時候，人民有服從的義務，這是因爲官署是行使統治權的機關，服從官署合法的命令處分，即是服從統治權，那是理所當然。</p>
<p>以上講的是人民在憲法上規定的義務，以下再講。</p>
<p>（六）甚麽呌法治的國家。</p>
<p>我們中國，幾千年來，是行君主獨裁的政治，君主的意思，就是等於法律，並且可以變更法律，法律有沒有，還是適當不適當，倒不覺得重要，這是任人而不任法，是重治人而不重治法的辦法，一般的官吏，亦多便宜行事，自由專斷，人民的義務，是沒有一定的限制的，人民的權利亦沒有一定的保障的。遇有賢明的君主，良好的官吏，未嘗沒有愛民的心，做有益於人民的事，但是賢良的君主官吏，到底是少有的，君主官吏，好的旣不多見，而其做事情下命令，又沒有一定法律來拘束他，生殺予奪，無施不可，那是祗有君主官吏的權威，而無人民的利益，那是以天下來奉一人，而不顧國家本來的目的了。連人治兩個字，也談不到。法治更不必說了。所謂法治，是用法來治國，以法律爲治理國事的工具，不但國家機關的組織及權限，須用法律來規定。所有關於統治權行使的事項，沒有不依照法律，人民對於國家的權利義務。固然在法律上明白規定，就是人民相互間的權利義務關係，也有一定法規，可以解决。這是任法而不偏重人治的辦法。治理國事的官吏，如得其人，個僩都好，那末以好人來用好法，不是政治上最好的現象嗎？萬一不得其人，做官吏的，不一定個個都好，可是有了法律做他行事的標準，不是聽他濫用權力，爲所欲爲，所以政治上，不一定受他不好的影響。如果注重法治，人民的義務，是有一定的限度，負担是公平的。人民的權利，是有法律保障，不至有所謂階級壓迫等弊害。如就國家方面來看，亦祗有尊重法律，才能開誠布公，得人民的同情，以推行其政令。所謂有治人無治法，這一句老話，是有毛病的，現代的國家，在國際上可以站得住的，有榮譽的，那一個不是注重法治呢？法治優於人治，這是可以相信的，以下再講最後的一點就是。</p>
<p>（七）現代國家應有怎樣的人民。</p>
<p>現代的國家，都是注重法治，可以說，不重法治的，就不配稱爲現代的國家。大概國家的强弱，政治的優劣與其人民的强弱優劣有關。不是優强的人民，是不會構成優强的國家，不食產生良好的政治。外國與我們中國，同是有政府，同是有官吏，何以他們能尊重法律，能造成法治的國家，我們就不能够呢？難道是我們政府官吏，應該負責，我們人民，就沒有責任嗎？我以爲不然，我以爲我們人民，也應負很大的責任。我們知道法治國的人民，應當有法律智識的培養，其中最關重要的，可以舉兩點來講，頭一點是要知道人民爲什麽會有權利，如果一個人，在社會上沒有責任，在人羣裏沒有相互的義務，那便沒有法律上的地位。人之所以爲人，全是因爲他是社會的一分子，對於社會，有所貢獻，有所盡力，與其他的人，同此社會的目的，同此社會的生活。他的個人地位，是因社會承認其爲一分子而來的。他的權利，都是因爲社會的承認，才能存在。換一句話說，法律之所以保障個人的生命財產與利益，是因爲他與社會有關，保障個人利益，就爲保障社會的利益。如果個人全與社會生活無關，這種人是沒有法律上的意義的，明白了這點道理，那末每一個人，每一個人民，應該先盡他的義務，不要忘了對於社會國家的關係，都想對於社會國家，有所效勞，人人有此思想，有此精神，還有不團結不進步的國家嗎？第二點是要知道怎樣才算違法。違法與非違法的區別，果然是件難事，但是大體上，應該有個認識。遇有義務應盡，的知道是法所應盡，不會遲延，不會借詞推諉，遇有權利應享的，知道是法所應享，不會放棄，不會甘受欺凌。遇有官署的命令官吏的處分，知道是合法的，自然服從照辦。知道是違法的，也會有正當的主張。遇有自己辦理公務的時候，知道抱定依法辦理的宗旨，不會有違法的行爲，人人有此辨識，有此能力，還有不健全不守法的人民嗎？還有無所顧慮，貪汚枉法的公務員嗎？由此可知法治國家的基礎，在於人民有法律的智識，公民應有法律的智識，更不待言，我們中國是要與現代國家並駕齊驅於法治的軌道之上，如果我們人民，肯從法律智識方面，多多講究，那末，就有更快的進步，法治前途，是很可樂觀的。（完了）</p>

<h3 id="c61">招商兩江輪　昨在瀏河擱淺 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>江新已救出回滬建現正在拖救</p>
<p>吳淞口外海面、昨日有霧、國營招商局長江輪建國號、與江新號、先後在瀏河口擱淺、滬上總局、午刻始得到海軍部專發來電、立卽派愉往救、至晚、江新輪已先拖出來滬、而建國號尙未出淺、猶在營救中</p>
<p>建國遇霧擱沙</p>
<p>建國號載量二千七百七十噸、注冊爲一五八八噸、船身長二百七十八英尺二寸、闊四十二英尺九寸、吃水十二英尺、造自一九零五年、本月三日、在滬裝齊貨客、開往長江、四日晨二時、開離金利源碼頭、迨出吳淞口、已在五時許、其時淞口外海面霧露至重、航行至爲困難、船長黃友士且素來小心、乃行到離吳淞九海哩附近瀏河港口處、地名SpitBuroy、在重霧內錯行航綫、以致船身擱陷淺沙灘上、船長曾打倒車、擬竭力自行退出、無如吃水深而船載重、輪底擱入淺沙、無法移動、失去航行能力、</p>
<p>江新助救亦擱</p>
<p>該局下水江輪江新號、從漢口開還上海、昨日經過瀏河、將到吳淞口、發見建國輪擱淺、經江新發號探詢、建國輪卽請江新上前援助、將其拖帶脫淺、江新輪便停車、卽向建國擱沙處駛去、擬用鐵絲纜帶住建國、奮力拖下、無如該處吃水甚淺、江新亦爲重儎、尙未駛到建國輪附近、自身亦遭擱住、其情形雖較建國爲輕、但亦已失去行動能力、以致兩江輪同遭擱淺、</p>
<p>青天艦代求救</p>
<p>海軍部海道測量局測量艦靑天號、於昨日上午力時後、行到吳淞口外、鑒於江新建國在瀏河口擱淺、駛近詢問、即由該兩輪船主、請共代發一急電到上海總局、要求派輪前來拖救、靑天艦乃照辦、此電係發到海軍司令部、中午十二時、始由海軍司令部轉吿招商局、囑其迅往營救、該局得報、立卽派輪往拖、</p>
<p>寶和拖救失敗</p>
<p>英商怡和洋行寳和輪、昨從宜昌漢口開還上海、經過吳淞口外、發見江新等擱淺、不能移動、而江新輪於寳和駛近時、請其代爲拖救、寳和輸本航行互助之意、上前拖救、無如該處時在落潮、水勢甚淺、寳和輪往拖江新輸、竟未能成功、遂即開來上海、另由招商局所派船往曳、</p>
<p>江新出淺到滬</p>
<p>該局得到海軍司令部電吿後、便與康正記接洽拖輪、趕往營救兩江輪、乃由康正記、派定馬力最大之北洋號拖船、於昨日午後二時前、由滬趕赴吳淞外、到瀏河口、先拖江新、北洋拖力大、吃水又淺、往拖江新時又値漲潮、江新輪卽爲拖救出淺、又因江新船身無損傷、自行開還來滬、至午後五時許、已先返滬、到金利源碼頭、卸客起貨矣、</p>
<p>建國正在拖救</p>
<p>北洋號拖輪現正在拖救建國輪、因建國遭擱處、較江新輪爲淺、在拖救工作上、比較稍爲費力、據該局發言人聲稱、大致可望救出、至遲今日上午、定能曳離淺灘、茍建國船身無大損傷者、仍令上水赴漢不再開還上海、以免多延時日而誤船期</p>

<p>— 金華亭</p>
<p>三部工作</p>
<p>牛奶塲大凡分產奶，製奶，營業，會計四大部，自由農塲，當然不能例外，現在把該塲四部工作情形，大槪的分述一下。</p>
<p>（一）產奶部　（甲）關於牛的喂料交配等項，（乙）研究育種和選種，（丙）管理和保護，以上數部，都要專家管理才行，但是這類的人才，實在不多，就是獸醫人才亦很少，上海乳牛的傳染病，到也很多，（一）胸膜肺炎，（二）口蹄疫，（三）牛瘟，這三種病來源不妨說一下。胸膜肺炎是三年前從俄國傳染來的，乳牛最易犯這個病。口蹄疫是去年從美國傳染來的，牛瘟以上海靑島兩處爲最多，現在已有各種血淸防治以上的傳染病，但是費用每年要化數千元。</p>
<p>（二）製奶部　（甲）　瓶洗瓶手續分四部，（一）去油，（二）洗刷內外，（三）過淸，（四）蒸汽奶桶亦相同，（乙）蓋　奶蓋手續亦分四部，（一）除塵機，（二）消毒機，（三自動記錄溫度表，卽將牛奶在華氏表一百四十五度的熟度中，燒煮三十分鐘，（四）凉奶機要把熱牛奶凉到四十五度，（丙）裝瓶機只要裝瓶時，手指不要碰着就好了。</p>
<p>（三）營業部　該塲訂戶共有千餘家，近來除原有工作外，還有下列的三種運動，期望着一方面减低價格，一方面使牛奶普遍化，</p>
<p>（甲）兒童飲奶運動　尤君認爲牛奶是兒童們最好的食品，所以從十月一號起，已經實行兒童飲奶運動，他的辦法，大約是（一）暫定數額一千名，牛奶瓶分兩種，小瓶半磅，取價一角二分，中瓶一磅，取價二角，該塲並且新近從美國運到奶牛十九頭，都是十分健康的，預備拿這十九頭牛的奶，專們來供給這個兒童飲奶運動，並且聘請女護士一位，每天輪流到各家庭訪問飲奶的兒童。</p>
<p>（乙）學校飲奶運動這種運動就是要牛奶普遍到學校裏去，他是分二次做的，第一次是去年，先從大學着手，已經成功的有復旦，滬江，　約翰，交通，同濟，大夏，光華，海醫學院等八個大學，第二次是今年，從中學生和敎職員方面進行，現在飲用的中學生和敎職員，已經很多了。</p>
<p>（丙）機關飲奶運動　這個運動現在亦已實行，用四分之一磅的牛奶，和四分之一磅的紅茶，冲和後再以白糖用罐頭裝裝好後分送，另外再配餅乾二塊，讓機關裏的公務人員，不必出門，就可進用茶點，取價一角，爲避免麻煩起見，預備發一種代價劵，以便隨時扯給送牛奶的人。</p>
<p>（四）會計部　會計部有五個職員，除管理上海，蘇州，杭州三處的各種帳目外，還要負責編製各種的統計表，統計表每日的報吿，每月的一覽表，與一年的年表，這是統治方面最關重要的工作。</p>
<p>最後尤君還講到他這個農塲創辦的經過，和現在的情形，將來的計劃，自由農塲楚一九二〇年間辦的，開辦費只有一萬幾千元，最初一月祗能做幾塊錢的生意，現在可以做一萬幾千元，同時我們的資本亦增加到六萬元了，一九二六年的時候，以二萬元的資本，到蘇州設了一個分塲，營業很好，一九三一年，以三萬元在杭州又設了一個分塲，營業只够維持，比蘇州要差一點，最近預備在南京再設一個分塲，正在籌備中，同時龍華方面巳經長期租定地皮二十四畝預備在明年建設總塲，此外還有二個附設的工作，一個是「家庭服務社，」由一位沈先生主持，主旨是代辦訂戶的家庭庶務事宜，如交水電房捐等類，一個是「農村研究室」，由一位李先生主持，現在訂有一百餘種中外日報，幾十種的農村雜誌，幾百部農事書籍，搜集各種材料，預備改進農村，現在蘇州薛家灣，開始試辦，而且有些成績了。</p>
<p>這位尤先生，對於農事有極大的興趣，所以他的談話開始以後，滔滔不絕，毫無厭倦之態，他是在世界最負盛名的美國康乃爾大學農科畢業的，對於美國農事的情形，格外熟悉，他有幾句關於美國紐約牛奶與上海牛奶的統計比較，他說美國全國共有乳牛二千四百萬頭，每年產量約九百萬萬磅，如果一頭牛一年產量在六千磅以下者，就要殺了，紐約每日由四方運到的牛奶，約五百萬磅，運奶的汽車，有五千五百萬部，火車三十二列，計二百五十九輛，最遠的距離是四百五十英里，最近四十四英里，全上海共有乳牛三千頭，每日銷三萬磅，如果論牛奶的新鮮，上海牛奶要比紐約好得多，但是銷數上比較起來，那是相差太遠了。</p>
<p>勘誤　昨日所載自由農參觀記內從專家談話起至「使優良者生存」句止，共十二行，應接在「全塲巡禮」段內「三消毒部」第二十四行「不致發育生存」句後，特此校正。</p>

<p>大勝亞典耀</p>
<p>四時半球證西人鳴笛開賽、由亞典耀隊撥球進攻、雙方制服同籃衫白褲、故打來球員有辨別爲難之概、混戰三分鐘、尹金振右路盤飛進、對方左衛衝出攔截、尹即遠傳中路、謝慶福趕前迎之以頭、球應聲入網、遂在歡呼聲中首開紀錄、亞軍失此球後、立即反攻、無奈我方守衛森嚴、致無功而退者屢、其後馬華亦有數度進攻、但操之過急、故數次遠射、非中門楣彈出、即越門而云、僑界方在嘆息中、謝慶福忽得姚勝華之傳、又施其故技以頭一頂、球又飛入網窩、造成二對零之比、對方因求勝心切、動作不免躁暴、我方許厚坤竟被抓傷左眉際、血流如注、幸非要害、即用紀友齡代其職、續戰聲中、馬華雖佔上手、但亞隊中衛綫守衛頗嚴、馬華屢攻不入、離完上半塲前兩分鐘、姚勝華忽在敵門十五碼前左脚猛射、竟被接出、後爲謝慶福截住、再交與姚勝華、姚不負使命、以左足弄過敵衛、再用右脚猛射、球由右門角擦入、爲勢美妙、亞隊守門惟有搖首興嘆、上半塲完塲時馬華以三對零佔先、</p>
<p>檸檬時間過後、對方易地續戰、馬華以上半塲勝利在握、進攻愈覺兇烈、而彼方亦自知無反攻之能、及轉攻爲守、此塲頗予馬華以頑抗、然馬華爲老練之師、愈打愈勇、李以耀在敵門前十碼遠射、球略高而越門、不旋踵馬華得四十碼自由球由謝慶福主踢、謝提足射個平地快球、守門雖撲地然、亦無及矣、此球勢勁而急、博得全塲掌聲、成四對零之比、中央開球後、慶福野心未死、再衝進一球、但球證以此球越位、故未算賬、當時馬華氣燄正盛之時、彼方只有招架之功、而無還攻之力、故又被慶福轉身踢入一球、姚勝華不讓慶福專美於前、先後得謝慶福尹金振之助、連入兩球、造成半打之數、彼方爲打破此圓蛋紀錄、各人乃抱破釜沉舟之志、果然戰雲一變、其時五鋒時向菲腹地侵略、黃錦柏雖曾兩度接過險球、但其後以謝發裕簡德輝林志泉陳啟萬之拱衛得力、門前極見淸閒、反見尹金振謝慶福姚勝華相繼攻門、但均被接、混戰聲中、謝慶福與姚勝華雙雙並進敵區、姚氏於敵門前一十碼遠描準猛射、球如離弦之矢、被方守門跪接、球復漏手滾入、引得全塲呌絕、直至完塲、各無所獲、馬華乃以七對零奏凱而歸、</p>

<p>七月已經到了，割乾草的工作已經開始；各個小園圃的作物正在茂發，長長的夏日郤充滿了興味的點綴，房子的門自朝至暮一直開着，童子們除上課外，均在戶外生活。功課郤不長，假日又不少，因爲裴氏夫婦相信如要培養强健的身體須有不少的運動，夏季本不長，不如用在戶外的工作爲最宜，竄子們居然成就了皮膚燻炙，有血色有力氣的，隊；他們具有很好的胃口；很發達的手臂與腿脚，以前的出袖與褲脚都覺得太短了；他們在梅莊是跳躍歡笑；到了屋裏作極有趣味的玩意兒；到了外面，漫山遍野地走去；賢明的裴氏夫婦見了他們的一羣孩子身心並發，心中何等快樂！—凡這些，我也不能一一詳細描寫。實在二樁事已够使他無限歡欣，而這件事的發現，郤是全出於他們的意外，而也是最偶然的。</p>

<p>— 沙鷗</p>
<p>江蘇省立敎育學院的農業實騐塲，爲了試騐改良畜種，曾經出了重價，向國外購買優種的牛羊鷄豕多頭。不知是水十不服，抑是飼育無方，這些洋牛洋猪都不及僑居在中華的洋人來得發福。</p>
<p>雙十節那一天，全國鄕村工作討論會十九省市九十九團體一百六十九代表假座該院開會。該院的農塲上所畜的一條大公牛偏於是日下午一時壽終正寢。生怕驚動來賓，農塲上的辦事人便秘不發喪。乃預於院外高地正對惠山挖穴以作「牛眠之地」。入晚熄燈後，悄悄叫農夫抬走，那知十五名結實農夫，不能動牠。（此「公」體重約一千六百斤）不得巳臨時叫一班短工帮忙。捆束定當，正待上肩，不料獨龍扛（粗木）不勝重量，突然中斷。祇得另換木槓，不料又斷一根。於是半夜三更敲開木行，購木做槓。其時已經千夜後兩點左右。以二十二人之力，想把這條洋牛屍體抬走。下葬時已天色發白，晨鷄報曉。眞所謂「星夜奔喪，匍匐就道」了。</p>
<p>這牛是嗬囒純種，價値八百元。專爲交配用。院外牝牛交配每度須納資二元。不啻「雄妓」云。</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>季節風吹紅了楓葉的容顏，又吹白了蘆葦的鬚眉，古廟簷下蛛網上噓着蛀孔的葉片，遠遠地矗起秋山的赭色，寂寞的溪流上橫躺着獨木橋，悠然地仰望着薄薄的雲片來去——又是蟹肥的時期了。</p>
<p>在被溪流激滑的灘泥上，留下向日葵子似的蟹爪痕，紊亂而交錯，示了昨夜蟹羣的奔忙，然而亦因為這種痕跡的顯示，便動了鄉人候蟹的心機。這在蟹自己是全然想不到的，人們會利用光明去引誘它們的生命，飽口福或囚去市鎭騙錢，把水屬甲蟲的生命來沾潤自己的</p>
<p>當二更的鑼聲沉落在遠處村舍中，這裏一提桅燈巳悄悄地點上火，在溪畔，度葦蕭蕭，似乎爲蟹嘆息着終期的命運，或有一隻孤雁劃破秋深夜長的寂寞，但候蟹者是不管的，他甚至運鼻息也迸住了，守候着，守候着……</p>
<p>蟹終於又像昨夜一樣被引誘上泥灘，可是它們不知昨夜引誘它們的是皎潔的月光，而今夜却是候蟹者的桅燈的火。可憐蟹雖生有兩隻眼睛而偏偏還向候蟹者手邊爬，一隻進了竹籠，另一隻仍繼續前來，一隻，一隻…候蟹者的臉上露出得意的欣悅，而心中在盤算明天的燒酒，旱烟。油和鹽，一切生活的需求。於是，市街上有蟹賣了，醉的，縛煮的，麵漿油煎的。</p>
<p>這全要感謝捉蟹者的功勞吧？而蟹的生命是不被注意到的。四歲的小兒子不知從那裏拾來兩隻蟹螫黏在牆上拍着手，難道人自幼就是殘忍的。那麽，我又小必怨怪候蟹者了。</p>

<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>爲了職務，自己整天的坐着無罪的監牢，平日輕易是不會讓我越雷池一步的；所以無論春夏秋冬的季節，我除了跟着別人一樣的把衣服更換之外，幾乎一年到頭是那麼機械地生活着，永遠不曾有過一個機會跑到大自然里去步一回春郊，或賞一次秋色。</p>
<p>現在，總算給我得到了一個比較有閒的職業，因此常常能够使我跑到公園里去散一回步，或靜坐一回，於是老樹上的禿枝我也看見了，草徑里的黃葉我也踐着了，然而這一切景象雖未免帶着太濃厚的感傷情調，並且，彷彿每一個角落都堆砌着無限的憔悴滋味，但來遊園的人却仍舊那麽活躍的。——我相信多數靑年人的心裏一定充滿着興奮的愉快。當我每次坐在池畔那隻椅子裏幽思或遐想的時候，總會聽到那靑年男女的嘻笑聲，和孩子們的歌唱聲，悠悠然的在我耳邊飄着，飄着。可是寂寞在我心頭，却無法支使開它。</p>
<p>「我也能够返還到孩子時代，忘記一下生活的創傷麼？」自家兒對自家兒這樣問着；但除了苦笑之外，沒有可以自慰的答語，自己還依然望着天空的白雲</p>
<p>「秋天了」！一片黃葉從我頭頂飄下來，跌在我的衣襟上，我小心地將它推到了地上，恰巧給一位摩登女郞的高跟鞋兒一踐，它就粉身碎骨了。這時我心底忽然起了一陣波動，彷彿伊這一踐踐在我心窩上一樣，我這顆心也給伊踐碎了：「人生是短促的，生命是有限的，我　怎樣去追求我的生活呵！可是，可是我的靑春早已給生活趕走了！」我默默地站了起來，從樹林裏穿了過去，望着池邊的一羣孩子出神。</p>

<p>海上有詩社，初名求聲　後稱鳴社；近値二十年紀念，特函召遠近社友，爲話舊之集。觴詠餘晷，復由孫師漱石，姚丈勁秋，製虎備酬，懸燈微射。頗極一時之盛。</p>
<p>同社之善射虎者，當推：葉丈友琴，姚丈祝萱。而姚丈且有打虎將之雅諢。他如：賈叔香，朱大可，鄭質庵諸君，俱能手也。社外嘉賓之擅此技者，如施濟羣，陸澹盦，徐行素諸君，亦復翩然蒞正；肩摩踵接，環立虎前；角鬭心鈎，指其掌上；雅人深致，猗歟休哉！</p>
<p>社友吳琴木君之夫人，頗嫻翰墨，而射虎尤具巧思；於勁秋丈之虎，連中五條。記其底面云；一子叔爲政，射聊目。商三官。一一東，射泊人名一：董平。靑年夫婦，射字一鯊。」「惡客，射字：一飯。一盲人騎瞎馬，射方言：對和尙罵禿驢。」讀者於此可想見其手揮目送，妙緖環生也已。時予在旁，忽觸機得一虎，擬調琴木；面爲：「吳太太猜謎，射四子二：」底則。「夫人不言，言必有中」也。顧與琴木交尙淺，慮或見怒，未敢縣出耳！又見一條，爲：一好古文，射京劇目；開天闢地，蓋「好」字，古作子丑字。相傳；子時開天，丑時闢地，故云然耳。乃爲女公子文所中。可謂一門風雅，令人景羨無已！</p>
<p>予腦久傷，不耐思索之故；故僅射一條，幸而獲中。乃：一夢幻泡影露電，捲簾格，射蒙經一句；如六經。」是也。而所獲贈品，爲勁秋丈之蘆雁立軸，‘名貴逾恒，予心乃至快焉。</p>
<p>兩日間，射出之虎，不下百條，迻錄若干，以公同好。然爲篇幅計，不復分別爲射者留芳矣。如：「社，射四子三；夏后氏以松，殷人以柏，周人以栗。」「千不是，萬不是，都是小生的不是，集崑目二：達旦，負荊。三謁樊榭姬人墓，集崑目二：拜月，上墳。」「問郞底事迎桃葉？目緩臨流打槳行。集崑目四：盤夫，納妾，姑阻，渡江。一羅隱，射六才一句：天際秋雲捲。」「言，射六才一句：怎得個人來信忽通？「黃昏一到不孤棲，美人名二：夜來，雙成。」「無心不造孽，有口便難言，射字一：亞」「易集縣名：二金匱，無錫。」皆漱石師所撰者。又如：「否，德忝帝位，射四子篇目：堯曰第二十。」美女無雙，集韵目三十一尤，五物，十五刪。」「漁，集縣名二：分水，上虞。」與之塊，射字一：侍。」「射明韵目一：十八巧。」「三月陽春，射字：一農。」「公孫僑之世父，射昌黎文一，捲簾格：國子先生。」「典集崑目二，上墳，後索。」「作之君，作之師，集崑目二：前親，後親。」「惟仲叔境旣不寬，貌尤枯瘠，射四子人名三：孟公綽，季孫肥，公孫衍。」「貨，射四書篇目：爲政第二。」「未墜於地，射晋文一：生孩六月」「一諾風高自不凡，射字一：雖。」「長孫次孫，射四書人名二：子之，孟仲子。」「少小離家老大回，射四書人名二：季路，孟之反。」「弓刀，射六才一句：繡鞋兒剛半折。「則勁秋丈之作也。</p>

<p>待我們走入正殿，太后的那些大臣已早在殿下等候着了，一見太后到來，便毫不遲疑的照例一起跪倒，恭恭敬敬地叩着頭，並逐一報名請安；這是一套瞧得厭透了的老例，可以無需多叙，待大家都參拜過後，那慶親王却依舊跪在現上，正在等候老佛爺准他發言的特旨。（四五一）</p>

<h3 id="c150">我國小學敎員的待遇問題 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>誰都承認，我國小學敎員是十分淸苦的。其待遇的菲薄，有的差不多連維持個人的生活都不够。</p>
<p>無論各國小學敎員之待遇，比較我國任何地方爲優，我國最低數如陝西敎貝，有年俸二十四元者。最高數如湖北敎員，有年俸一千八百元者。但這是指全國最低數和最高數而言。若普通的情形，一位小學敎員，每年大槪可得年俸二百元至四百元之譜。</p>
<p>敎育是立國的根本大計。一個國家的敎育發達與否，關係於國家的興衰，非常重大。現在世界各國如英美法等，牠們之所以日益强盛，除軍備力量充實之外，敎育的發達，當然是一個最大的原因。查我國敎育的不發達，原因雖多，敎員待遇的菲薄，應是一個致命的癥結。故我國今後不言改良敎育則已，要改良敎育，首先當以改善小學敎員的待遇着手。因爲小學敎員的待一日不改善，我國的敎育，便也‘一日無從改良。這一點希望敎育當局加以深切的注意。</p>
<p>聞意大利對於小學敎員，非經國家考試合格，不能任用。旣任用之後，卽爲終身職務，國家無故不能更動其位置，日本的情形，也和意大利一樣。如是，敎員的待遇旣優，用心自專。蓋生活上有此鞏固優越的保障，然後才能充分發揮其才能，以盡瘁於所從事的敎育事業也。</p>
<h3 id="c151">欽差大臣 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>—業餘劇人在金城演出—</p>
<p>「欽差大臣」在我的眼簾中出現，這還是第一次，但我渴望着「欽差大臣」出現，是在好幾年前，我讀過這劇本時便有這種想念了。</p>
<p>本劇上演的繁難點很多：人物的個性不容易把握，其　一；情調不容易統一，其二；服裝，道具，佈景，要吻合十九世紀前期的俄國宮庭，雖不難找着參考的資料，但要逼眞，就有難能之戚。此劇在俄國初上演時，因爲成績的陋劣，竟引起原作者果戈理氏憤怒的抗議。</p>
<p>果氏的劇作雖不多，但自「欽差大臣」發表以後，俄國劇壇上便彷彿投下了一顆炸彈，一掃小丑式的打諢，無聊的胡調，而變爲嚴肅的笑罵，人生的鞭笞，醜惡的懲罰，他用着他那放浪不覊，尖刻如刀的筆，把當時的俄國的封建官吏的貪汚，胡塗，以及附屬那階級層生活的一羣的醜態，在短短的五幕劇中全展示出來，果氏在這一點上是灌注了他多量的心血盡了由封建社會過渡到資本主義社會的助產婦的責任的。他是偉大的「批判的現實主義者，」人物的姿態，如縣長，校長，醫院院長，審判官，郵務局長，潑婦，商人，以及假欽差，便是當時俄國上層建築的整個基構，這楚排除槪念的恨世者相的輪廓而典型地，辯證地來形象化了的，不是嗎？便是那位陪審官身上的「酒氣」，也是「他小時候他母親害了他」的。他有一隻特別敏感的「鼻子，」只做了個把月小官，便把全俄羅斯的官吏身上的惡臭嗅盡了，而他從這里便發出令我皇尼古拉也覺得臭不可當的批評語，諸君假如記得起那審判官再三提出賣狗的話，便會啞然失笑吧！這與他寫小說的方法是沒有二樣的。在編製上除開第一慕在現在認爲不大相宜的獨白外，全劇是一段緊一段，一幕緊一幕，使觀衆的心無時不被緊張的劇情的進展攪亂了的，假如把莫里哀許多喜劇和「欽差大臣」一比，不單作風各別，便是結構也大不相同。我不敢說</p>

<p>莫里哀的作品要遜果戈理一步，但莫氏因鬆而有時失之鬆懈，在刻劃的深度上也沒有果氏的刻毒，這是有目共睹的事。</p>
<p>說到這次的演出，整個成績，又超出「娜拉」以上。角色的分配，舞臺的構圖，服裝的設計，音響的配合，煞費了匠心的，尤其關於人物的個性，及幕與幕間的情調，是做到了十分之八以上的。自然也有缺點，那便是有時太誇張得近於文明戲，譬如殷秀岑那位人物是下流的小丑，在縣紳中是缺少可能性的。在音響上，當葉露茜瞧着「欽差大臣」去後且歌且舞時，缺少配音，以及脚步聲，打巴掌，全以鼓來配音，是欠缺逼眞的。</p>
<p>演員方面，顧而已除字音間有不準外，一切都好，這樣一個吃重的劇，他似乎綽有餘裕。金山在第一幕太弱，把一個紈褲子弟的性格，演成一個扭扭捏捏的女性了，飢餓决不會一剎時便會改變人的性格，但以後便一幕比一幕生色了。王塋和葉露茜演母女倆的吃醋，一語一動，都打入人們的心坎，面部的表情，尤見靈活—不過在王小姐的化裝太漂亮了一點，與她的女兒葉露茜一比，看不出是母女，而是一對姊妹花。鄭君里在輪廓上很像一位精悍的俄國的官吏，但在言語動作上却又是那末脆弱，封建時代的審判官，應當還有相當的威嚴的。他是一個堪够盡職的，沒有什麼特色，左明的老僕，他是運用純熟的技巧演出的，其中我們可以看出他大槪沒有多排演的，因為有時他的動作非常慌張，而當第二夜我再去看時，便比第一次沉着多了。顧夢鶴的劇不多，但他只有走路的姿式有點欠缺外，兩次讀信，都怪引人發噱的，而那種似眞非眞的態度，正是果戈理式的作風，殷秀岑和劉茫，在說明書上已宣布是一對勞萊，哈代，不料他們眞當作勞萊，哈代做了，果戈理佈置這一對人物，是笑中帶淚的完成封建政治的縮影，而他們却完全做了發笑的人物，這是錯誤了的。施超見着欽差大臣幾乎變成了一個癡子，吃雪茄煙那一塲，硬生生地把煙也噴到地上，似乎太誇張了，但是這是導演的責任。此外如藍頻，朱銘仙，金毅，何康禮均皆稱職，只有吳玲女士連談話我也沒聽淸楚。</p>
<p>全部說來，成績總算不平凡了。</p>

<p>天才有一點兒亮，小三子的媽就把小三子呌了起來。她是個被遺棄的中年婦人，自從丈夫出亡之後，她帶着惟一的財產—小三子艱難地度日，靠着自己的十個指頭。現在小三子也能拾一點垃圾來帮助她了。可是她看着自己的兒子每天被她呌醒時的疲態，心里總是隱隱作痛。</p>
<p>「臉洗了嗎？快點兒吧！天已經不早咧！」她一面說，一面望了望小三子的臉，接着又抬起頭看了看天，又繼續做她手中未補完的破衣。</p>
<p>小三子始終一句話也沒有說，餓着肚子，背起了檢垃圾的筐子，走了！</p>
<p>她趕了出去，在呌着，——是呌他回去吃了飯去，可是他頭也沒回的走了。</p>
<p>小三子有一個要好的伴侶，隔壁的阿虎，他們每天一塊兒去檢垃圾，一塊兒玩。</p>
<p>「喂！你看！那邊有個甚麼東西！」阿虎發見了一樣新奇的東西似的。</p>
<p>「阿！一個洋娃娃！」小三子跑過去拾了起來，以為是自己的幸運。</p>
<p>「這娃娃是我看見的！你為甚麼拿去呢？快快還給我！」阿虎向小三子論理似的，又帶了恐嚇的口吻。</p>
<p>「哼！還給你！你想吧！我拾着的。」小三子不服氣似的。</p>
<p>「哼！不給我嗎？你看！看看你老祖宗從外洋帶來的炸彈！吃得消嗎？」阿虎從破筐掏出一個洋瓶，做着博鬥的姿勢。</p>
<p>「不給你，一定是不給你，老子向來不怕打！」小三子倔強說。</p>
<p>「好！」</p>
<p>哭聲在弄堂的垃圾桶旁振作了，小三子被阿虎打破了頭；臥在血泊裏，兩眼緊閉着，垃圾筐也被旁人踏碎了，人圍了許多。最後救護車送他進了醫院，可是他的口中喃喃的——「我的洋娃娃！我的洋娃娃！」</p>

<p>— 樂筧</p>
<p>海輪在厦門港內歇了半晌，重新裝飽一肚子的胭脂粉香，西裝和英語，又緩緩地車起了鐵椗，直放上海。</p>
<p>統艙裏聚着一簇簇的靑年男女，混淆着，吐着粉香；滲進一股難聞的船艙特有的悶氣，像破布那麼地窒息着人們的肺葉。便因為這樣，和好奇着船尾一夥男女的歌聲笑語，我的兩條漫無目的腿總不由地踱到船尾，這末凭着船欄，呼吸一口高爽的海風，和默默地數着每個波濤迸出來的浪花；或者裝着厭倦的神態，扭轉身子，側靠在船欄上，看看那夥靑年男女的消遣的花樣。</p>
<p>乃有一個獨身的白俄，是健全結實的高箇子，有着一隻麪包膚色的臉龐，湛金而帶棕色的瞳球固定地繫在淡藍色的眼白中間，木木而無表情，他的行裝是一隻小小的衣箱，上面貼着許多港脚的行李單，這足以證明他的生涯的飄泊無定了。而且從他的粗劣的衣着，可以推測他是個工人。</p>
<p>他的木然的眼光裏，似乎深藏着嚴威的寒光，固定而且銳利，使我不敢正視。</p>
<p>有幾次，我怔怔地看住海上的白鷗，翩躚地翱翔着，抓碎一朶朶的浪花，沾起一滴滴的水點，神往之下，我的視綫却結背後的曼妙的笑聲引誘回來，我瞅着那夥南島的天眞的兒女在表演吻的動作。可是我的眼角却感受一種莫名的威脅，炯炯地進迫着，我怯懦地斜了斜眼，才發現是她那兩隻木然而又犀利的眼睛，好像正在監視着我。</p>
<p>終於有一次我抑不住氣憤，我憤懣地對他吆喝着：</p>
<p>「你看什麼……」我對他正視，在一瞥之下，我却發現他的眼睛是和藹的，有着質朴的木然的光彩。</p>
<p>這窘住了他，他由驚詫而不安，　視着身傍，但沒有第二個人，他的窘狀却引起我的懊悔。我狼狽地溜開船尾那地方，回到令人作嘔的船艙裏。</p>
<p>這以後我沒曾踱到那邊，我不欲見他，直到——</p>
<p>第二天午後，船　　着　　的噪聲，我方始跑到那裏，擠着翹着頭望，我聽見一個查票的老槍在編排他的理論。</p>
<p>「沒打票別想坐船，我們可不能馬虎的！」</p>
<p>「我是有票子的。」他操着生硬的廣州話呑呑地說。</p>
<p>「我是有票子的，我到厦門找女人和兒子。」衆人說一百句話，而他只有這麼一句；直至幾記耳光沉重地落在他的到頰上，他也只有這麼生硬的一句。</p>
<p>「哈，厦門早落在屁股後了！」大家嘩然一笑。</p>
<p>他顯然有點不明白，呆呆地讓查票員在他的衣袋裏掏去僅有的四隻洋錢，補票。</p>
<p>「我時有票子的，我到厦門找女人和兒子！」</p>
<p>這時，我隱約地看見地平綫上的幾堆小鳥的影子，預料明天一早船靠上海碼頭。</p>

<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>「胡天八月便飛雪，」口外該是風雪載途，玄冰滿地的季候了。在屏障似的西山維護着的故都，雖然尚未至呵氣成冰的嚴寒時節，可是朔風凜烈，落葉滿天飛的景象不由你不有點蕭瑟凄零之威了。</p>
<p>披着那件陳舊的駝絨長袍拖起沉重的步伐，在塵土包圍中，我孤伶伶地踏進北海公園的大門。</p>
<p>踱着，踱着，踱上了白塔，舉目一看，那故宮金黃色的琉璃瓦在夕陽中發出萬丈光芒，紫禁城危峨的垣堞是那麼森沉雄壯，曾經給中國歷史留下一頁悲劇的煤山，在炊煙繚繞之中分外灰黯，再把視綫展開去；那正陽門的崇高偉大，也許使你的情緒緊張，北平圖書館的藍色屋面也許引起你一點詩情畫意。</p>
<p>迎着風，讓落葉打在面孔上，我忘記了萬里外的故鄕，悲哀，抑鬱，無聊都給北風吹散了。</p>
<p>張望了一會，眼看着太陽快要躲到西山的背後了，忽促地下了塔，我靜悄悄溜進漪瀾堂。北海的荷花已經凋謝許久了，湖水經不起昨晚北風的拂刮，冰啦。</p>
<p>想起盛夏時，這里該是多末熱鬧呢，穿蟬翼樣衣服的女人挽着紳士的臂膀悠悠來去該是何等潑剌啊！這時候，也許你會發覺綠揚下面坐着幾個短髭日本人在垂釣呢。漪瀾堂里更少不了那些小市民的點纔。三五成羣的圍　而坐，一面啜着茶，一面讓涼風驅去身上的熱氣，這情景是何等閒適，然而曾幾何時，朔風把紳士女人們都驅走了。剩下這冷淸淸的名堂給那些躍跳自如毫無顧忌的麻省佔據去了。</p>
<p>帶着一顆凄凉的心從長廊踱了出來，手，又會不由自主的撫摩一回那玉石欄杆。這心情眞像送遠行將別的戀人一般依依不捨。</p>
<p>出了漪瀾堂，在那古柏夾道的大路蹀　着，雖然是冬天了。可是針樣的柏葉仍那末靑葱可愛，無怪那些遠方的游客到了這里，不由行不嘖嘖稱贊了。</p>
<p>夜色使我的步伐急促起來，走到九龍壁前注定了脚，一面喘着氣，一面對這巧奪天工的製作細細揣觀一會，那栩栩如生的龍好像就要騰雲飛去似的，自問不是藝術家對這名貴的壁不敢妄加批評，然而牠的確使我百看不厭。</p>
<p>五龍亭在夜色蒼茫中越發精雅可愛，琉璃瓦的金黃色和柏葉的靑綠色，錯綜雜沓，綫條分明是一幅最好的圖畫。</p>
<p>夜幕漸漸下垂了，枝頭島兒的聒噪，烏鴉的悲鳴逐客令一般將我趕出了北海公園的大門，迴顧傍倚水邊的五龍亭幾隻營火蟲一樣安靜地躺在那里。</p>

<p>永遠親愛</p>

<p>我記得；那年的夏天，邪風呼呼，烏雲堆堆，窗前的飛燕，往往來來，佔居了樑上廳邊，築巢自慰，一聲聲地刺激到我的胸懷，我記得；我記得；我記得我的愛，她有秀的容顏，伶俐的天才，眞使我陶醉地欣愛，永遠親愛，永遠親愛，永遠親愛。</p>
<p>我記得；那年的春天：淸風徐徐，濛雨漸漸，　外的蜂蝶，蹁蹁躚躚，飛翔着花業草間，卿我徘徊。一對對地引動了我的眼簾，我記得；我記得；我記得我的愛，她有秀麗的容顏，伶俐的天才。眞使我陶醉地欣愛，永遠親愛，永遠親愛，永遠親愛。</p>

<p>老婆兒龔稼農在『翡翠馬』中，飾一販賣毒丸的惡黨。當他的毒物機關被王徵信識破而受了檢查的時候，他非常地驚慌起來了，這似給他一個驚吿，所以要想事要進行順利，這非得懲治王鐵民不可。</p>
<p>某一天的夜晚，月色是那麼地暗淡，顯得分外地寂靜和恐怖。老婆兒帶着一支手槍，偷偷潛進了王微信的住宅裏。這時老王正坐在燈下研究全部破案的方法，老婆兒就乘着他一個人靜思疑神的當兒，從窗外碰的對他射出一彈。可是王徵信的精明，眞像神明似的不可摸捉，將腦袋一歪，便閃過去了，同時他非常地機驚地，順手「砰」的一聲，將台燈摔倒在地，全房立時黑暗，雖然窗外老婆兒的槍彈連珠般的射着，因爲失去了目標，一槍也未發生效力。當然，這時老婆兒驚慌起來了，情形非同小可，一面繼續着開了幾槍，一面就趕緊逃走了，待到大偵探的手下人全部武裝開來的時候，老婆兒已逃得無影無踪了。</p>
<p>當「翡翠馬」在中央試片的時候，銀幕上映到這一段，有幾位密司和小天使們，都幾乎驚呌起來了。當然，「翡翠馬」中，驚險的塲面還不止這麼一段。——這裏不過時一個例子而已。</p>

<p>秦桐辱王引袁美雲哭了</p>
<p>藝華公司有聲新片，岳楓導演「花燭之夜」，昨天拍如下的一幕戲。</p>
<p>一座被環抱於靑山綠水之間的鄕下房屋，那便是名著作家王西匋的著作生涯所在。這天，西匋正埋首案頭從事一部以婚姻問題爲主體之長篇戀愛小說的寫作，忽然他的愛人葉彩雲奔跑了過來看他。彩雲是一個天眞未泯的美麗姑娘，她住在離西匋家不遠。西匋急把稿紙推開一旁，上前將彩雲接過來坐在椅上。但此時西匋忽發見她眼眶裏貯滿着淚珠，便很驚詫地問着她爲着是什麼事？彩雲初尙不肯說出原委，到後來經不起西匋的一番溫存，乃慢慢地訴道：「我們兩個人的事情巳經給李家（彩雲之未婚夫家）知道了，剛才我爸爸給他們呌去罵了一頓，回來爸爸便對我出氣，更把我毒打了一頓，罵我是賤骨頭，也罵你是拆白黨，壞蛋。後來，他又說以後若再發見與你在一塊，就要給我沒命。」彩雲說到這裏，便很傷心地哭泣了起來。看看王西匋，牙根咬得緊緊地悲憤着睨視一方。</p>
<p>彩雲又說：「現在我爸爸出去，媽媽看我可憐偷偷地放我出來，並呌我問你有沒有辦法？」</p>
<p>「再過幾天等我這部小說寫完，拿到上海書店去換錢，把那個錢還給李家不就是成了嗎？」西匋這樣地安慰着她說。</p>
<p>但當二人正談得非常歡洽的時候，彩雲的父親已跟踪追來了。他看見二人的親密情狀，不禁怒火中燒，大罵西匋爲壞蛋，拆白黨，下流東西，淫棍不已，而氣憤憤地拖着彩雲就走了。西匋呢？也只有呆立着目送之而巳。</p>
<p>因爲導演的努力，故空氣非常緊張。而飾葉彩雲之袁美雲，飾王西匋之王引，及飾葉父之秦桐三人，又皆是演技能手，故表演上有特殊之成功，自亦母須待言了。</p>

<p>我人若不單向利慾上着想而更擴張眼界一看頗具趣味的自然美，則郊外生活，實爲一極有意義的事。總之，欲求發揮興趣，增進康健的人們，郊外乃最良好的去處。然則，建於郊外的住宅，尤其是中等家庭的，究具有怎樣的特徵呢？當然，正如十人共處，則各有不同的面貌一樣，各人觀察住宅，皆有互異的眼光。且人皆習慣對自己的東西，存不滿的念頭。於是客觀地考究郊外住宅優勝的特徵，實一極有趣味而又煞費苦心的事。茲簡略地就事實言之，約有如下數點。</p>
<p>住宅與周圍的調和</p>
<p>一、光綫郊外所異於都市的，是能充分地採入光綫。歐洲近代的建築構造，頗能注意此點。玻璃可採用能透過紫外綫的，這麽就可沐浴陽光的恩澤。卽是說近來流行的日光浴，已可於室內舉行。要之，建築時須考慮良好的採光</p>
<p>二、眺望郊外是具有適合的條件，可盡情眺望。在都市，除特殊環境外，幾不能遠望。此種特點，可說祇有過郊外生活者纔得享受。依此，巧妙地考慮房屋部位的安排，則可接收極美妙的景色。通小窗看高山的優美姿態，其愉快實難形容。較近者如樹林，田壟等的眺望，亦是一甚堪留戀的景色。如是，疲勞於都市的身心，可獲充分的休養。</p>
<p>三、通風四面空曠，綽有餘裕。當夏季，如股計得宜，則凉風常會悠然蒞止，可消除　暑不少。在夏季常吹南風的國度裏，通風處由南向北，更能飽受郊外生活的惠賜。</p>
<p>四、住宅的形式常居都市，遠覽四周的機會稀少。但閔至郊外，因四野空闊，近觀遠瞻，無往不佳。在此種塲合中，家屋的形式，必能加以相當的注意。尤其是對遠眺方面，須考慮周圍的樹林。同時，亦不可不對色與環境的調和等，加以研究。於老樹交叉中，　影映紅牆一角；茂木叢裏，白壁微現，會使人生出很幽美的感覺。</p>
<p>然而，如以上所述的那種環境，究如何纔能造就呢？周圍的處園，究取怎樣的處理方法爲適宜呢？誠然，環境不是很容易能創造出來的。首先，當未着手建造前選擇土地時，應在腦中描畫出自己理想的家屋，乃能選出適當的地方。</p>
<p>於郊外，散在許多緩度的傾斜而，灣曲的溪流，岩石，叢林等種種天然的恩賜品，若能適宜地巧爲利用，儘可造成使人讚美不置的住屋。大槪在稍高處，得水便利而排水優良，日光充足，上面必生茂林，眺望自能適合。</p>
<p>取用此等天然賜與的材料，就勢排設庭園，實一最適當的事。依此，不單使每日生活得到極大的慰藉，且可使過訪的友人，皆大喜悅。此種設施，實非祇憑人力所能辦到的。</p>
<h3 id="c167">平民劇院設計應注意之事項 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 劉仲超</p>
<p>戲劇電影。本負有灌輸知識。輔助敎育之使命。故在文化發達之國家。劇院多至不可勝算。我國除幾大都市外。其他城市之有劇院設備者。實如鳳毛麟角。有之。亦不過蘆蓆木架。設備簡陋者。至大都市之劇院。大都富麗堂皇。美輪美奐。且其建築費之巨大。票價之高貴。亦不能普及民衆。故我國各地。在在需要平民化劇院之設立。</p>
<p>平民化劇院之建築。須注意及戲劇電影皆可適用。使所投之資金。不致有呆滯之虞。房架之構造。必須堅固。因內地之劇院。往往有失愼倒塌。演成慘劇者。故最好用鋼骨水泥。或丁字鋼任之俾可耐久避火。費用雖昂。但亦一勞永逸之安全辦法。劇塲樓層之支撐。在上海之大劇院，往往用橫貫劇塲之大梁。或很長之懸梁。這種辦法，殊覺危險。應仍以柱子支撑。雖觀客有「吃柱子」之憾。亦不過廢去十數座位而已。至設備裝飾方面。並不需要冷氣。熱水汀。壁內電燈。彈黃椅子。圖案門柱。彫刻天花板。絲羢簾幕地毯等。只求其簡單淸潔可也</p>
<p>座位之數量太多。不免虛耗資本。太少又碍將來之發展。最好宜在一千至一千三百之間。分配於上下二層。其比例約上三下七。至一層或三層之分配。於視綫上皆不正確。故不可用。劇塲之體積。須使每一座位有一二立方尺之空問爲度。通氣設備。須用抽氣風扇。及間接　氣孔洞。窗戶須使之减少。以免擾亂視綫。門之數量。須使每一百二十人有一。寬度以四尺爲最低限度。門之位置。須散在各面。不可集中於，一處。</p>
<p>座位之在樓下者。須列成橢圓形。最寬處不能過三十五座位。每座寬以十五寸爲度。前後最多不能過三十排。每排距離。最少須二尺半。如融光影戲院。座位約六七十排。最後面之觀客。似太廢目力。殊不相宜也。甬道最好四條。每條以二人並行爲其寬度。此道須比地面低下數寸。俾往來客人不致障礙視衆之視綫。（這種辦法。滬上劇院尙未見過。）</p>
<p>樓面之構造。須使樓下後排視綫及銀幕頂上。樓上各排。能視及臺邊。不爲其前排人頭遮擋。如此樓面距臺如近。則其坡度急。後排觀客之脚。常可碰上前排觀客之頭。殊覺討厭。如離臺遠。則樓座後排離臺太遠。否則樓座亦須减少。故樓面及兩廊之位置。須有適當之距離。高度。及坡度。此與劇塲之面積。高度。皆有密切之關係。放映室不可離銀幕太遠或過高。最好凸伸至樓面座位之中。俾使光綫愈淸楚。與銀慕之角度愈正確。以上種種。雖極淺鮮。要亦一平民劇院設計時瞧注意者也。</p>
<h3 id="c168">關於建築上高度發展的危機 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 歐陽古</p>
<p>中國的文化，在世界上比較的發源得算是最早的了，單就建築的藝術上一方面而言，也曾影響過外人，但如果有人說起關於中國的建築史，却是可憐得很，竟能够搖頭的說：一無所有，直到最近，非但沒有看見過一冊專書，連這個中國建築史的名詞，也似乎沒有成立的可能，又如日本朝鮮等國，從前都直接簡接的授受過中國的建築術的，所以他們的廟宇住屋，都帶有東方色彩，中世紀以後，外來的勢力與影響，改造了一切建築上固有的藝術，把原有的舊築物，全部推翻，同時各都中間也都感受到人口的繁增，商業的發達，在固定限制的土地中，大有不敷應用之槪，於是向上發展的潛勢力，成爲必然的形式。</p>
<p>雖然，高度發展的確是解决人口衆多城市的最妙方法，俗語所謂「佔天不佔地」，與各方面都沒有什麽妨碍，但足事實並不如此，我們看了下面的　查，便可以明白了：</p>
<p>去年美國紐約保健局調查商業區域中一千零六十二的辦公室中，共有五千八百三十三名的辦事人員，其中百分之七十九的辦公室，都是處在極高的建築房屋中，室內空氣與光綫不良，且日中亦須點燈，以致生理上　生　　減少，血色蒼白，視力薄弱，體重减少的病症，由此可知與衛生康健上的影響極大。</p>
<p>爲了這個綠故，英美各國，都有明白的規定，分劃區域，對於房屋的向空發展，絕對加以限制，有的把道路的寬度爲標準。日本因　另有地質的關係，高大建築物，很不多見，只怕一旦地震起來，爲害更大，上海公共租界與法租界的公寓銀行等高大建築，都須祇少　進四分之一的士地以上，且與對面屋頂的照射光綫，也須成五十六度的仰角，免得四鄰的房屋，受牠的影響。此外世界上各大都市房屋限制最高的支加哥Chicago　在二百六十呎以上，但也不得超過前面道路寬度的二倍又半，普通住宅建築，尤其是本埠公其租界的石庫門弄，竟連三樓也不允建造，可見其防禦的精密，以致種種危險的减少，自在意想之中，如易以高層建築，上下必用升降電機，如遇火災，則危險更不堪言了</p>

In terms of propaganda, they have been able to weigh the needs of reality and, in the effective control of news and culture, achieve the effect of guidance and promotion. In terms of the people's movement, they have been able to take national revival as the goal and conduct practical training from national life. In terms of overseas party affairs, there has also been much practical guidance. All of these are particularly noteworthy progress.

<h3 id="e2">New Monetary Policy to be Uniformly Implemented in All Provinces and Cities <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Planning to Revitalize Enemy Property; Reports from Various Regions on Financial Stability; Suppressing Excessive Price Increases; Ministry of Industry Studying Measures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the currency declaration was announced, the Ministry of Finance submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to order all provincial and municipal governments to implement it simultaneously and uniformly. At 10:00 AM on the 4th, Gao Bingfang, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, went to the Central Broadcasting Station to broadcast the currency policy declaration and announcement to the entire country, hoping that the public would uniformly understand this measure as an essential plan for economic recovery. The government will severely suppress excessive price increases. Meanwhile, Li Tang, a secretary of the Ministry of Finance, reported on the significance of implementing the currency policy at the Ministry of Finance's weekly memorial meeting at 10:00 AM on the 4th. The Ministry of Finance's announcement included the establishment of a chattel mortgage loan bank and revisions to the real estate mortgage laws in order to revitalize real estate. The Ministry of Finance has already prepared these plans and will soon submit them to the central government for approval. In order to stabilize the exchange rate of legal tender, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction. As for the custody reserve of legal tender, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will act as the reserve treasury. It is reported that branches of the three banks in various regions will also establish reserve sub-treasuries, and the Management Committee will determine the number of sub-deposits in various regions. When a reporter inquired about this unified legal tender centralized reserve method to Liang Shangdong, Director of the Commerce Department of the Ministry of Industry, Liang said that he was unable to express his personal opinion on this major issue. When asked how to stabilize prices in the future and whether the Ministry of Industry would issue an order to the national industrial and commercial circles for compliance today, Liang said that it was still awaiting discussion by the Vice Minister of Industry and had not yet been decided. The Ministry of Industry is currently paying attention to stabilizing domestic prices, and measures are being studied. The general idea is to make the people thoroughly understand that the Ministry of Finance's policies are for the benefit of the country and the people, so that there will be no excessive price increases. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Tianjin Silver and Money Industries Comply with Orders</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Banking Association and the Money Industry Association held a meeting early on the 4th to study methods of complying with the Ministry of Finance's order to issue legal tender. Various banks reported the amount of silver they had in storage, totaling seven million, which was immediately sealed and frozen pending inspection. Starting today, all bank paper money will not be redeemable. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because our Ministry of Finance announced the abolition of silver dollars and the use of legal tender, foreign banks in Tianjin specially convened a meeting on the 4th and decided to convert the silver dollars accumulated by the banks into paper money at the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Wuhan Strictly Prohibits Rumor-Mongering and Trouble-Making</p>
<p>(Hankou) After the Ministry of Finance issued an emergency order to improve monetary policy, Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed local military and police authorities to protect local banks and strictly prevent rumors from disturbing law and order. The Hubei Pacification Commissioner's Office forwarded the order to all army divisions on the 4th. The Police Department summoned the directors of the two public security bureaus in Wuhan and the director of the Special Third District on the same day to instruct them on measures to protect banks. The municipal government issued a notice to citizens to use legal tender and prohibited the creation of rumors and attempts to speculate and raise prices, with severe punishment for violators. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Due to the legal tender issue, the banking sector in Hankou held an emergency meeting and decided to comply with the implementation. All banks are operating as usual. The two chambers of commerce in Wuhan also held separate meetings to ask the authorities to explain the legal tender measures. The market in the city was stable on the 4th. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications took in silver and issued legal tender, amounting to about 1.5 million yuan. The total silver stored in the city was 20 million yuan. The premium for silver is still rising, Shen Bank notes are falling, and the prices of goods and daily necessities are rising, while the prices of raw materials are falling. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Hunan Provincial Government Holds Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>(Changsha) The provincial government held an emergency meeting on the 4th and decided to assist in the centralization of cash and the handling of provincial bank reserves, and set a time to talk to the city chamber of commerce and members of the money industry to discuss ways to stabilize the market. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Reports from Various Regions on Financial Stability</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Ministry of Finance received a telegram from Minister Kong in Shanghai, instructing on the measures to abandon the silver standard, the Ministry of Finance sent Director Gao Bingfang of the Taxation Department to give a speech at the Central Broadcasting Station on the 4th, explaining the truth of the emergency decrees, and issued notices to the governments of all provinces and cities for compliance. According to telegrams from various places, the financial situation is very stable. The Ministry of Finance also ordered the three banks to circulate more subsidiary coins in the market to facilitate turnover. The municipal government of the capital promulgated the decrees and announced them to all industries. Any speculators or rumor-mongers will be severely punished according to law. An official from the Ministry of Finance stated that this decree is neither currency inflation nor a paper money policy, but the implementation of currency management. In the future, the amount of issuance will not be increased arbitrarily, and there is a purpose of preparation. The purpose of unifying issuance and concentrating reserves is to establish a good foundation for currency by determining the legal tender unit that China has never had before. As for whether the small silver dollars circulating in the market should be restricted by the emergency decree, all parties have requested the Ministry of Finance to explain. Before there is an approval, they can continue to circulate as usual. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) All banks implemented currency reform on the 4th, and the market was unusually calm. The prices of foreign goods, hardware, oil, and paper rose sharply. The people were extremely understanding and supportive of the government's emergency decrees. The procedures for the three banks to buy and sell foreign exchange are still awaiting detailed announcement. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Capital Prohibits Raising Commodity Prices</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the new currency suspension of cash payments order, the municipal government, considering that merchants arbitrarily raise commodity prices and lower the price of silver dollars, inevitably disturbing market stability, the municipal secretary Wang Shufang summoned the director of the Social Affairs Bureau Chen Jianru and the director of the Finance Bureau Lu Zhaoqiang, etc. at the municipal government conference room at 3:00 PM to discuss stabilization measures. As a result, the municipal government issued a notice according to the official letter from the Ministry of Finance, advising the people to use legal tender, and sent personnel to the Ministry of Finance to contact and request instructions on stabilizing financial measures, and together with the Gendarmerie Command and the Police Department, issued a notice prohibiting merchants from raising commodity prices and lowering the price of silver dollars (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to request instructions on how to stabilize the market, the Municipal Government sent the Director of the Finance Bureau Lu Zhaoqiang and Secretary Pan Geya, etc. to the Ministry of Finance at 5:00 PM to meet with Vice Minister Zou Lin, but because Zou Gong was out, they changed to visit Secretary Li Tang and talked for about an hour. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Capital Discusses Stabilizing Market Conditions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Money Industry Association convened a temporary meeting by standing committee members on the morning of the 4th, after the Ministry of Finance announced the suspension of cash payments, to discuss stabilizing market conditions (tonight, each yuan is equivalent to 12.049 cents of small silver dollars, with each cent discounted at 83%, equivalent to 250 cash, and each yuan is equivalent to 3077 copper coins. Yesterday's market price was 13.029 cents of small silver dollars per yuan, with each cent discounted at 76%, equivalent to 260 cash, and each yuan equivalent to 3396 copper coins. Compared with yesterday, each yuan differs by 9.8 cents of small silver dollars, a shortage of 319 copper coins. The association will ask the Social Affairs Bureau for instructions on measures. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Banknotes of All Banks Continue to Circulate as Usual</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the banknotes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications in the capital were designated as legal tender and the use of cash was prohibited, all three banks posted the Ministry of Finance's announcement at their entrances on the 4th to inform the public. The Central Bank of China has stopped cash payments, and the banknotes of other banks continue to circulate as usual. The amount of cash and coins in stock at each bank as of last Saturday is the standard. After sealing the income, it will be handed over to the Legal Tender Issuance Reserve Custody Committee designated by the three banks for exchanging legal tender. The committee has not yet been established in the capital, but the capital is not a financial center, and everything is subject to the arrangements of the Shanghai head office. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Capital Social Affairs Bureau Investigates Prices</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Due to financial changes, the Social Affairs Bureau dispatched personnel on the 4th to investigate commodity prices and exchange rate fluctuations to prevent speculators from excessively raising prices. Upon receiving the documents, the bureau immediately discussed stabilization measures and instructed all trade associations to pay attention. At present, it will first work with the Police Department to conduct investigations at any time. According to news from the rice industry, the price of rice in the capital has not changed on the 4th, and it is not possible to predict what will happen in the future. The capital's rice has always been sold as it is imported, so the market price is based on the purchase price. The selling price of coal on the 4th rose slightly. In addition, starting from the 5th, the fare for public buses in the capital will be changed from one dime of subsidiary coins to a value of 30 coins, which is four coins less than yesterday. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Opinions of Various Economists</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Changheng said that the government's emergency measures on currency are indeed more practical and effective than all other proposals on improving China's currency system. He personally had this proposal two years ago, so he unusually approves of the government's measures. According to this method, it is neither currency inflation nor a paper money policy, but the implementation of currency control, which is the so-called currency management. However, he still has several opinions to contribute to the government for adoption: (1) China's currency is unusually chaotic. After the promulgation of this method, it should be able to achieve the effect of unification. Although China's currency system is chaotic, it has always been based on the principle of cash payment. Now, our country is following the example of various countries in the world and using paper money issued by the national bank as legal tender and suspending cash payment. The people will inevitably be surprised. In order to make the people understand that this paper money has full reserves, the organization of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee should include representatives of farmers' associations, labor unions, and pure financial scholars in order to win the trust of the people. (2) In the future, the amount of legal tender issued should have a budget and should not be issued arbitrarily to avoid the danger of currency inflation. In particular, it is necessary to use the quantity theory of money to stabilize prices, that is, the issuance of legal tender should expand and contract with the prosperity and decline of trade. (3) Because legal tender can buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction, it is closely related to international trade. It is hoped that in managing foreign exchange, efforts should be made to attach restrictions to unnecessary imported goods. (4) The raw silver and silver coins collected from the people should be cast into factory bars and stored in the reserve treasury. The reserve treasury should also be divided into several locations throughout the country in order to be safe and demonstrate credibility. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Economist Zhao Lanping said that in his book "China's Fundamental Self-Help Plan for Economy, Finance, and Finance" in May, he advocated abandoning the silver standard and drafted detailed measures. What is being implemented now coincides with that article. Abandoning the silver standard is indeed a fundamental way to alleviate the current economic difficulties. Moreover, China's currency recently has not been a purely silver standard system. Now that the government has explicitly ordered the abandonment, it is indeed a necessary action and will have no adverse impact on the general economy and finance. In the future, China's economic and financial panic should gradually disappear. National tax revenues, such as tariffs, will gradually increase due to the rise in gold units, and unified taxes and stamp duties will also increase due to economic recovery. Regular fiscal revenues and expenditures can gradually tend to balance, so there is no need to increase the issuance of paper money and inflate the currency. As for prices, they will inevitably be slightly more expensive, which should be prevented. Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors and the government must work together. As for the future monetary system, it should be directly changed from the current paper standard system to a paper standard system that uses gold for foreign transactions and paper for domestic transactions, so that it can permanently get rid of the shackles of the silver price. After the silver is nationalized, it should be sold at an opportune time and converted into cash and gold exchange to replenish the legal tender reserve. Therefore, if the United States actively raises the price of silver, it will be beneficial to us. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance expert Liu Zhendong offered his opinion, saying that (1) there must be a strict administrative organization to allocate silver for paper and control currency; (2) there must be precise research and preparation on the issue of currency supply and demand, and the issue of subsidiary coins is even more important; (3) the method of centralizing cash and the location of storage should also be studied; (4) how to prevent villains from stealing private hoards; (5) how to crack down on petty criminals who spread rumors and profiteers who manipulate the market, so as to avoid turmoil in the financial sector and rising prices.

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Shilian accompanied American Treasury Advisor Buan and others to various rural villages on the afternoon of the 4th to investigate the attitude towards the currency in reality. According to the discussion, small shops in rural areas with little capital and cash circulation believe that if the government issues more paper money and has credit, transactions will inevitably be more active, and the difficulties in farmers' production can also be reduced. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Shilian said, (1) emergency decrees can stop currency contraction; (2) the government's control of foreign exchange can develop international trade, and domestic industry and commerce can be revitalized as a result; (3) the national financial and economic situation and management can be improved; (4) the policy of unlimited purchase will be more beneficial in the future (5) This policy is not currency inflation, but can avoid currency contraction.

<h3 id="e4">Revision of Curriculum Standards for Primary and Secondary Schools <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Education convened experts for a discussion meeting on curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools. It has been three years since the promulgation of the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools. Practitioners, based on their experience, and observers, based on their knowledge, have all felt the necessity to carefully consider revisions to achieve perfection. The Ministry of Education convened this meeting with the same motivation, integrating various opinions and following the best strategies. Their utmost concern for education is truly admirable. The outcome of this meeting should naturally not be overlooked.</p>
<p>It is noted that the agenda of this meeting included a proposal for detailed teaching outlines for each subject in primary and secondary schools. This is indeed crucial and fills a previous gap. In the past, the standards only contained broad outlines. Editors of textbooks relied on their own interpretations, which inevitably led to inconsistencies. Examining textbooks from various publishers, they all claim to be edited based on the curriculum standards, yet books on the same subject vary greatly in detail, emphasis, and selection of content. Practitioners either did not adopt textbooks or determined their own teaching outlines, similar to textbook editors, injecting their own discretion, which inevitably deviated somewhat from the broad outlines. As a result, the education received by primary and secondary school students varied in quality and quantity depending on the textbooks used and the teachers encountered. This led to disparities in levels of attainment, and significant differences in knowledge and skills. With the establishment of detailed teaching outlines for each subject in the future, editors and practitioners will have common guidelines to follow. This will ensure that the education received by primary and secondary school students, regardless of location or school, will be of uniform quality, and the problem of uneven levels of attainment and significant differences in knowledge and skills can be largely avoided. Although the appropriateness of the teaching outlines remains to be seen, the resolution to formulate detailed teaching outlines for each subject is undoubtedly a further step forward and deserves our praise.</p>
<p>Regarding high school mathematics, this meeting resolved to divide students into groups in the second year. Those inclined towards science will study more mathematics, while those inclined towards humanities will reduce mathematics hours and increase studies in subjects such as Chinese and foreign languages. The burden of high school mathematics on students has long been a common complaint, and the lack of outstanding achievements in mathematics has also been a widely observed fact. Since Ms. Chen Hengzhe published the article "Save the Middle School Students" in the Ta Kung Pao, the examples cited mostly concerned the heavy workload of mathematics affecting students' physical health. As a result, those concerned with education paid particular attention to the issue of the quality and quantity of mathematics courses. In our opinion, students' physical health depends on the entire educational system and cannot be solely attributed to the heavy workload of one or two subjects. Even considering that mathematics courses cause headaches and mental fatigue for students, imperfect teaching methods should be regarded as the most significant factor. It is not appropriate to hastily discuss the quality and quantity of the mathematics course itself. The current resolution does not disregard the importance of mathematics to the entire education system but merely increases or decreases the hours allocated to it, allowing students to develop according to their inclinations and within their capabilities. It also avoids the previous tendency to excessively separate the humanities and sciences into separate extremes. It can be confidently asserted that this will be endorsed by insightful individuals. However, after the division into groups, the improvement of teaching methods remains urgently needed. Otherwise, the effects of the division will be difficult to see, and criticism will continue to arise.</p>
<p>Another important resolution is to merge hygiene, nature, and society into a General Knowledge subject in lower and middle grades of primary school. The intention is to create a systematic approach, and we particularly appreciate that it deeply understands the principles of integrated teaching. When children first enter school, based on their inherent experiences, they only know individual things and events, and have no concept of separate subjects. They are presented with a timetable from the teacher and textbooks, with numerous subjects that are difficult to remember quickly. When they study each subject, individual things and events are divided into several parts. One part is encountered in subject A, and another part is encountered in subject B. It does not suit children’s established habits. This is known by education experts. Now, hygiene, nature, and society are merged into a General Knowledge subject. What was previously possible is now uniformly implemented. Only in the higher grades will subjects be separated to focus children’s learning concepts. Starting with integration adapts to children’s habits, followed by analysis to guide research. The intention is extremely good. However, we still have something to say. The goal of General Knowledge is to obtain practical experience. It is best to abandon textbooks and replace them with personal experience and on-site observation. In primary schools, hygiene has a book, nature has a book, and society also has a book. In teaching, it does not go beyond explaining sentences and writing notes. Although the subject names are different, the actual content is an appendage to the Chinese language. Even if there is practical benefit, the amount is limited. Publishing houses benefit from having textbooks, and teachers who are lazy and inexperienced also benefit from having textbooks. Are textbooks really necessary tools in teaching? This is something worth considering when revising curriculum standards.</p>
<p>For female primary and secondary school students, there is also a resolution to increase home economics education. If this is regarded as a work project, there is naturally no objection. Other resolutions seem to be secondary, and will not be discussed for now. Overall, the results of this meeting provide better revisions and supplements to the previous curriculum standards, which is gratifying.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Both Britain and the United States Express Sympathy for China's Currency Reform, Considering it a Good and Timely Plan for Self-Rescue <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Government officials today, while unwilling to offer any formal criticism of China's new currency policy to stabilize currency prices, expressed that they believe this plan is a timely measure that can strengthen the central government's financial position and stabilize China's currency, thus alleviating the exchange rate fluctuations that have recently plagued the banking and business communities. Currency experts here vaguely stated that this plan is an expanded form of currency control recently implemented by China, a good plan for self-rescue, and one that has long been recognized as necessary for China. Because international financial powers have been unable to decide on a method to alleviate China's currency difficulties, China has no choice but to strive for its own solutions. Government officials stated that the U.S. Treasury Department is not involved in this move, and that other governments are also not involved. However, well-informed sources in the private sector generally believe that Sir Otto Niemeyer, the chief economic advisor to the British government, may have been consulted by China in advance. It is believed here that the nationalization of silver is a very important undertaking, the success of which depends entirely on whether the Chinese government can manage it effectively. The detailed implementation rules have not yet been disclosed, so observers are unwilling to judge its effectiveness. However, it is generally felt that the unification of banknote issuance will greatly consolidate the power of the central government, and that the concentrated efforts of various banks to issue banknotes will strengthen their credit. It is believed here that the recent successful issuance of banknotes by the central government in the interior has encouraged China's new currency policy. As for the centralization of foreign exchange powers, it can stabilize the value of China's legal tender, which is desired by the government and the general business community. Experts here believe that the biggest problem with this plan lies in maintaining sufficient reserves. Currently, these reserves are higher than those of any other country in the world, and the Chinese government should be able to exercise its powers prudently to maintain the existing exchange rate. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Times commented on China's currency reform, stating that this plan is welcomed by the general public, and if faithfully implemented, it can serve as the basis for reorganizing China's finances and placing them on a permanently sound footing. The Daily Mail stated that the Chinese government's announcement was welcomed by people in London. This plan was formulated along the lines of the most constructive new laws, and there is little doubt that it will meet the needs of those remitting funds to China. This move should bring inestimable benefits to the Chinese people and facilitate commerce, thereby enhancing the prosperity of the Chinese people. The Financial News stated that well-informed sources in London generally believe that China's announcement to stabilize currency values ​​almost means that the authorities intend to stabilize China's currency at a price aligned with the British pound. Whether the Chinese government can force its people to hand over privately held silver is still uncertain. Its ability to collect silver from the public will largely determine whether it can maintain exchange rates at the current price. This reform has a good chance of success, and U.S. silver policy may be revised. The Manchester Guardian reported that the Chinese government's abolition of silver is viewed in London as an emergency measure. Many believe that this move will ultimately be beneficial, and the first impression of currency and banking reform is extremely satisfactory. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers today published the Chinese government's currency reform measures in large print. The Financial Times stated that the Chinese government's move is in line with the best Western systems in all respects and is a good decision. It also stated that the success of this plan depends on the integrity and consistency of those who implement it, but there is no doubt that China can find people to manage this plan to gain trust and usher in a new era of financial stability for China. The newspaper concluded by saying that Britain and other countries will definitely provide the most sincere support and cooperation. The Daily Telegraph stated that this resolute and far-reaching plan for financial reform will definitely be endorsed by the business communities of all countries trading with China, and will open up great prospects for Chinese commerce. The Morning Post stated that the Chinese government has effectively announced China's departure from silver. This decision is swift and decisive, and should be done when the situation is critical. Its intention is probably to keep the Chinese currency from breaking away from its existing relationship with the British pound, but what kind of reserves and funds will the paper money be based on, and what kind of reaction will the Chinese people have? These are difficult questions to fathom. Britain will watch this great experiment with sympathy and hope for its success. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Sixth Plenary Session Held a Memorial Week Yesterday <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Reports on Chinese Scientific Research</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sixth Plenary Session held Premier Sun Yat-sen’s memorial week in the auditorium at 8 a.m. on the 4th. Over a hundred Central Committee members attended, standing in order of age. Chairman Yu Youren was at the front, with committee members Lin Jiangbai and Ju Zheng in the first row, divided into five rows. All staff members were behind, also standing in two groups, in an orderly fashion. Under the leadership of Chairman Yu, tributes were paid. Cai Yuanpei reported on the Central Research Institute and the general situation of scientific research in China. The main points were as follows: Major research institutions in the country are divided into two categories. 1. Government-funded institutions: A. The Central Research Institute, divided into administrative, research, and evaluation departments. B. The Peiping Research Institute, also with administrative and research departments. C. The Geological Survey. D. The Central Agricultural Experiment Station. E. The Economic Commission, with livestock, tea, cotton production, silk improvement centers, and cotton textile dyeing halls and hygiene experiment stations. 2. Private organizations and groups: the Science Society of China, the Ching Sheng Biological Research Institute, the Yellow River Chemical Industry Institute, the Chinese Xilang Academy of Sciences, and the Lester Institute for Medical Research. 3. University research institutes: Tsinghua, Peking, Zhongshan, Central, Wuhan, Nankai, and Yenching Universities, and Beiyang Engineering College, covering seven disciplines: literature, science, law, agriculture, commerce, education. The general outline of cooperation between this institute and other institutions is as follows: The duties of this institute are roughly divided into three categories: 1. Regular or permanent research; 2. Using scientific methods to study domestic raw materials and production; 3. Pure scientific research and cultural-related history, language, anthropology, and archaeology. Based on these duties, the institute has completed a cooperation and mutual assistance program to promote scientific research, in order to fulfill our mission of actively contacting other institutions while passively avoiding academic leadership. Concrete facts about liaison and cooperation include: 1. Establishing a council as the hub of academic cooperation in China; 2. Establishing the Chinese branch of the Pacific Science Association to complete cooperation in oceanographic research; 3. Completing cooperation in meteorological research; 4. Establishing biological cooperation; 5. Numerous other cooperation matters. However, upon careful observation, the scientific research undertaking, from its initial advocacy to the present, has only been around for a few decades. There have already been such achievements, and it has begun to be recognized by others in the international academic community. The Central Research Institute is the highest academic research institution in the country and dares not fail to inherit Premier Sun Yat-sen's legacy to catch up, learning from the strengths of Europe and the United States. 1. To enrich itself, 2. To welcome cooperation from others, both of which will hopefully achieve the initial intentions of Premier Sun Yat-sen in planning to establish the Central Academy of Sciences. The meeting adjourned after Cai's speech. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>

<p>Madame Wang's Remarks at the Time of the Assassination</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This reporter recently met with Zeng Zhongwu, who showed a Reuters report on the Central Party Headquarters attack on the 1st, stating that Madame Wang said at the time that Mr. Wang would not die. If he were destined to die, he would have died 27 years ago when he assassinated Prince Regent. Zeng shook his head and smiled upon seeing this, saying that the report was quite different from the facts. The reporter then asked Zeng about the true situation, as he was present at the scene at the time. Zeng said that after Mr. Wang was shot, Madame Wang heard the alarm from upstairs at the Central Party Headquarters and rushed down. At that time, Mr. Wang was lying on the ground covered in blood, but his expression was very calm, and his voice was clear. Seeing Madame Wang leaning over him, he used his hand to support his wounded head and said to Madame Wang, "I have been shot five times and will probably die. This is the result for a revolutionary. I have no regrets." He also said, "I have been a comrade and shared hardships with you for more than 30 years, and I have no regrets. I have no will." Madame Wang replied, "Yes, yes, everyone must die. We are revolutionaries, so even if we are unfortunate, I will continue to work hard. I will take full responsibility for raising our children. You can rest assured. But you are seriously injured now and should not talk too much. You should be rushed to the hospital for treatment. If you don't die, we can still work hard. Even if we die, that's all it is for us revolutionaries." At that time, Chairman Chiang was also supporting Wang's head with one hand, facing Madame Wang. Zhang Xueliang, Chu Minyi, Chen Gongbo, and others were also taking care of him. Madame Wang also said to Chen Gongbo, "This is not the time to cry. You should immediately call the doctor and notify our sons-in-law, but don't tell my mother yet." Then, Chairman Chiang, Madame Wang, and us sent Mr. Wang to the Central Hospital. Madame Wang had no other remarks except to constantly tell people not to panic and to call the doctor quickly. The above is what happened that day. The Reuters report of Madame Wang's remarks is not only inconsistent with the facts, but also quite ridiculous. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Paying Visits to Military and Political Authorities to Foster Sino-U.S. Friendship, Departing Guangzhou to Attend the Philippine Independence Day Celebration</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The Republic of the Philippines is officially established on November 15. The United States has a special relationship and hopes for the establishment of a nation by its fostered territory. Therefore, hundreds of people from the United States, both from the government and the public, will cross the ocean to the Philippines to attend the celebration. Important figures in the political world, such as the Vice President of the United States and the U.S. Army Chief Dunn, also took ships to the Philippines one after another. The U.S. Navy ship Dunn was on, arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of October 29. The American warships stationed in Hong Kong fired a 19-gun salute to pay tribute. Dunn landed and formally paid a visit to the Governor of Hong Kong. After entertaining in Hong Kong for a day, he also responded to the invitation of the Guangdong Provincial authorities to visit Guangzhou. The US Navy sent a shallow draft warship for Dunn to ride in, arriving in Zhujiang Baimaotan on the morning of the 30th, landed on the Shamian Concession, first went to the US Consulate in Guangzhou for a brief rest, and then took a car with霍琪士 to visit the Guangdong military and political authorities. Chen Jitang, Lin Yunkai, Li Zongren, Zou Lu, Xiao Focheng, Liu Jiwen, and others from the Guangdong military and political circles welcomed them at the Yingbin Pavilion on Zhonghua North Road, and arranged a large team of guards in full gear in front of the pavilion to await inspection. Upon Dunn's arrival, they raised their guns to pay tribute. Amidst the melodious military music, Secretary Dunn inspected the warriors for a week before entering the flower hall of the Yingbin Pavilion, shaking hands with Chen, Li, Lin, Liu, Xiao, Zou, and others. A brief conversation was had. Around 11 o'clock, Secretary Dunn resigned and departed, attending a luncheon at the American Consulate in Shamian. After the meal, he visited the famous attractions of Guangzhou, including Hualin Temple, Liurong Temple, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument, Huanghuagang Seventy-Two Martyrs' Cemetery, and the new campus of Sun Yat-sen University in Shipai. At 4 pm, he went to the Dongshan Aviation Society to attend a tea party of the various committees of the Southwest Political Council. All political commissars and military and political officials were present. After the meeting, he returned to Shamian to attend a welcome party for American expatriates. At 8 pm, Chen Jitang and Lin Yunkai hosted a banquet for Dunn at the joint office of the municipal government, accompanied by military and political officials from the province. After Chen's speech, Lin Yunkai gave a welcome speech as follows: "Secretary Dunn, ladies and gentlemen, we are deeply honored to have the presence of the US Army Secretary and his wife in Guangzhou today. The provincial government has specially joined forces with Commander-in-Chief Chen to host a banquet to express our welcome. China's foreign policy has always been based on friendship. We inherit the teachings of our ancestors and have always advocated being kind and good neighbors. This policy remains unchanged to this day and is in line with President Roosevelt's so-called Good Neighbor Policy of respecting oneself and respecting others. Premier Sun also instructed us with the principles of faith, justice, and peace. However, the realization of peace must be based on the establishment of true international friendship. Therefore, we are deeply impressed by President Roosevelt's words in his official speeches that "international friendship is no different from private friendship and must do its best to unite the power of mankind to create an atmosphere of mutual understanding and cooperation. " China and the United States started trading in Guangzhou the earliest, and most of the Chinese residing in the United States are from Guangdong. This time, the Secretary's willingness to come has greatly increased the friendship between the people of the two countries, which is truly a valuable record in history, etc." At about 8 o'clock, they dispersed in joy. Dunn took the original ship to Hong Kong that night and rushed to the Philippines from Hong Kong on the 31st. (October 31)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Jiujiang's Commercial Decline, More Than Thirty Businesses Closed <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Jiujiang is an important commercial port on the Yangtze River and the gateway to Jiangxi Province. The prosperity or decline of its commerce reflects the import and export trade of Jiangxi Province. The province has been plagued by bandits for eight years, and the production of major specialties such as rice, tea, bamboo, wood, porcelain, ramie cloth, sesame, peanut oil, and paper has plummeted. At the same time, due to the domestic and international recession and the Yangtze River flood, all industries are in decline, showing a downward trend. The following briefly describes the situation of various industries:</p>
<p>(1) Finance: The financial hub of various industries. In 1931, there were still 25 Jiujiang pawnshops. Later, due to sluggish business, many closed down. Currently, only Youcheng, Sanhe, Yuanxing, Shengchanghe, and Deyu remain. Among them, two are for exchanging small amounts of cash, and only three are lending. (2) Cotton Fabric Industry: The only textile factory in the province, Jiuxing Yarn Factory, has been heavily indebted in recent years due to the dumping of foreign yarn and the impact of the domestic recession, almost to the point of stagnation. The cotton fabric industry, which relies on rural areas, is in a precarious state due to rural bankruptcy. Only five operators can barely survive. (3) Porcelain: Export-oriented, with a large domestic and international market. When Chairman Chiang was stationed in Nanchang, the number of porcelain shops increased by one-third due to the military training held in Lushan. Before April and May of this year, each firm competed to purchase raw materials and produce fine art porcelain. Later, due to the transfer of troops and the cessation of training, no one was interested, and all capital was stagnant, causing great distress. (4) Ramie Cloth: This year's floods were devastating, affecting both the north and the south, and business is far from last year's. (5) Kerosene: The dumping of kerosene from the UK, the US, and Russia in China has a history of several years. Recently, due to the decline in purchasing power, bandit areas, and controlled sales, business is far from what it used to be. (6) Transshipment: Jiujiang is the gateway to the entire province, and the customs declaration and transshipment industry was extremely developed in the past. Now, with no exports of the five major specialties and declining imports due to low purchasing power, the number of businesses closed has reached more than 30 from 1931 to this year. This is just for the major ones, and all other businesses are also declining. (October 31)</p>

<p>--The Northwest Has Vast Land and Resources Worth Developing--</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie went to the northwestern provinces to inspect agriculture, industry, commerce, and ancient culture. Shen gave a speech at the Qingdao Rotary Club yesterday on his inspection and the current situation in the Northwest, and expressed his views on developing the resources of the Northwest. The following is a record of the speech for the reference of those who are concerned about the people's conditions in the Northwest. Shen said: "This time I went to the Northwest to inspect agriculture, industry, commerce, and new and old cultures. I departed by Jiaoji train on the evening of September 14, stayed briefly in Jinan, Tianjin, Beiping, and other places, and then took the Pinghan Railway to Shijiazhuang. I transferred to the Zhengtai Railway to Taiyuan. Then, I took the Jinbei highway from Taiyuan and reached Datong in one day. From Datong, I took the Pingsui Railway to Suiyuan, passing through Yin County to Baotou, the end of the Pingsui Railway. From there, continuing westward, although there are highways and camel teams or various Yellow River routes available, they are all exceptionally slow. Fortunately, Eurasia Airlines has regular flights between Ningxia, Lanzhou, and Xi'an, so I took a plane from Baotou to Ningxia, then from Ningxia to Lanzhou to Xi'an. The route I took was more than 4,000 li, and the total time spent flying was only seven hours, showing the progress of transportation."</p>

<p>Outpost 35 Miles from Magal, Only Minor Contact Along the Way</p>
<p>Italian Army Front Line on the Northern Front: The Italian army has occupied all of its offensive objectives tonight. It occupied the important caravan transit town of Haoxing at noon without encountering any resistance from the Ethiopian army. The town is 50 kilometers from Magal, which is the target for the first day of the offensive. (3rd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Asmara: The Italian army occupied the town of Haoxing early this morning. The Ascari scouts under General Biroli have occupied the highlands southwest of Magal, and the Blackshirts under General Santini are also advancing on Magal from the southeast. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Asmara: Yesterday at dawn, the Italian army began its offensive along the northern front, with Magal as its main objective. A major battle is expected in the coming days. Italian planes flew out for reconnaissance today and discovered a small group of Ethiopian soldiers advancing from Haoxing towards Magal, and another group of about 10,000 people advancing from the south. The division of indigenous troops led by General Biroli is attacking on the right and has reached Haoxing, 35 miles northwest of Magal, a few miles outside the town. Its scouts have entered the town today. At the same time, the main force of General Santini's First Corps is attacking on the left and has reached Taibai Laixing. Italian engineers are working hard to repair the roads, so that trucks can transport food directly to the front line. The Italian soldiers at the outposts are strictly disciplined and take various precautions to prevent attacks. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Asmara: At dawn today, the Italian army launched a major offensive along the entire northern front, with Magal, 65 miles southeast of Aduwa, as its main objective. A total of 100,000 troops are participating in the battle, led by General Santini's troops, who will engage with the forces commanded by Ethiopian generals Gasa and Seyum. The two generals have so far not prevented the Italian army from building roads outside General Santini's front line. The Italian army is using Ascari scouts as the vanguard, followed by small tanks and infantry. Prior to the offensive, the Italian army had transported 10,000 tons of ammunition, loaded on 3,500 trucks. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Italian Army Front Line on the Northern Front: Today, it was learned from the headquarters here that the attacking force consists of 125,000 soldiers and tens of thousands of indigenous troops. Apart from minor skirmishes, there was no resistance from armed Ethiopian troops. The Italian army only encountered natural obstacles in the terrain. All troops are passing through deep forests and steep rocks. The Blackshirt troops of the central column led by General Loli have reached Haoxin tonight, marching 14 miles without firing a shot. General Santini's right wing encountered only scattered resistance from Ethiopian soldiers. General Malavigne's left wing, leading camel and mule teams, opened into the Danakil Desert with the help of the surrendered chieftain Geksa and his 1,500 guards as guides. All Italian aircraft are soaring in the air to find the Ethiopian army's concentration. Prime Minister Mussolini's son-in-law, Count Ciano, and Mussolini's two sons are personally flying planes to participate in the war. Countless tanks are covering the infantry and going straight into enemy territory, followed by 5-inch caliber cannons. Magal can be occupied on Thursday, so that the Italian army on the front line can celebrate the recapture of a major town on Italy's war memorial day. Pilots reported that there were only a few Ethiopian machine gun and artillery teams on the flanks of the Italian army along the way to Magal. The Associated Press war correspondent said today that this offensive will probably take four or five days, after which it will stop to consolidate the front line, just as it did after the fall of Aduwa.

<p>Northern Front: Italian troops advanced today in four columns. The extreme left flank was composed of Ascari troops, advancing south along the edge of the plateau. The second column, led by General Bitru's Malavina troops, covered the right flank of the two main columns. The main force, led by General Biroli, was also composed of Ascari troops. General Santini led the extreme right flank, advancing 30 kilometers. (November 4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy has sent a total of 280,000 troops to East Africa. Among them, 110,000 are deployed on the Tigray front in Abyssinia. On the southern Somaliland front, there are only two and a half Italian divisions. It is said that reinforcements will be sent soon. (November 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Northern Front: After several hours of advancement, the Italian troops on the northern front have achieved their initial objectives. Italian and Eritrean troops have reached Embercon and Emba Mashel. At 10:30 AM, Blackshirt troops reached Ho-shan. According to Italian air reconnaissance, large Abyssinian forces are concentrated in Taishi, with 3,000 men detached to form a column and sent to Magale to resist the Italian advance. The column in the Tang Kaili area has not yet moved. When the "October 28th Division" of Blackshirts departed for the front from Mulih, they first lined up and saluted the statue of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, singing revolutionary songs. Some speculate that the Italian and Eritrean troops departing from An-di-si-ao did not follow the road from Ho-shan to Agu-la to join General Santini's forces in attacking Magale, but instead followed the Feijia River road from Ho-shan to Ma-san-bo-er to attack Magale. Although this road is not on the map, it is passable. Furthermore, two columns of Italian troops from the An-di-si-ao front are advancing on Magale from different directions, one starting from Fa-la-si and the other from Sa-sai-er-la-jia-mi. These two columns are composed of local soldiers and Blackshirts. (November 3rd Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Asmara: Shortly after the Italian offensive began, the main force of Ascari troops under General Biroli occupied the controlled area of Anda Abamas, surrounded by fertile and watery valleys. Many women came out to welcome them, bringing out their hidden cattle and sheep, which the Italian soldiers bought in large numbers. Meanwhile, the Blackshirt troops under General Santini will enter Ho-shan tomorrow. The current Italian front extends from the Taibela Hing Temple on "English Street" to the Amba Hing Temple on the A-di-ge-la Ho-shan road. As the Italian troops advanced, the temple rang its stone bell to welcome them. Monks from the temple sent a delegation with fresh meat, chicken, and eggs to offer to the Italian troops, expressing their submission. (November 3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e37">Britain and Italy Closer Than Before <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(London) It is believed in British circles that the Italian government may stop its anti-British propaganda in Italian newspapers by the end of this week and further reduce its troops stationed in Libya by at least one division. These are the conditions for Britain to reduce its naval strength in the Mediterranean. If Italy implements the above two measures, Britain will also reduce its warships in the Mediterranean. This is the result of recent talks in Geneva between British Foreign Secretary Hoare and Italian Chief Delegate Aloisi. Furthermore, as the atmosphere between Britain and Italy is now clearly more relaxed than before, Aloisi expressed a strong desire to improve British-Italian relations during the talks and made certain suggestions in his personal capacity, but implementation will require Mussolini's permission.

<p>(London) Two Italian naval experts will arrive here tomorrow evening to conduct preliminary talks with the British side before the London Naval Conference. According to information obtained by our correspondent, the Italian government has not yet decided whether to participate in the London Naval Conference.

<p>(London) It is rumored that the British government intends to reform the League of Nations. According to official sources, the current government does not intend to reform the League of Nations to maintain its power after the general election, nor will it change British foreign policy. Furthermore, after the talks between British Foreign Secretary Hoare and Italian representative Aloisi in Geneva, the diplomatic situation has not changed. Hoare and Aloisi did not propose a ceasefire between Italy and Abyssinia to facilitate peace negotiations. It is also said that the results of the British-Italian talks have not encouraged the British government to withdraw any warships stationed in the Mediterranean. (November 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Official sources stated today that the next three weeks may be the most important period after the intensification of the Abyssinian problem. Whether the war will spread to Europe will be decided at this time. Italy is prepared for any eventuality. Prime Minister Mussolini is now implementing his three-step plan: (1) Invade Abyssinia, (2) Attempt to avoid a European war, (3) Encourage the people to endure the various sacrifices of economic sanctions and seek alternative goods to those previously supplied by League of Nations member states. Diplomatic circles here believe today that if Britain can avoid further angering the Italians, there will be no possibility of war in Europe. However, any naval or military action to prevent Italy from conquering Abyssinia is likely to ignite the European powder keg. Mussolini met twice with Undersecretary of State Suvich today, while another 10,000 troops boarded ships for Africa. (November 3rd National Telegram)</p>

<p>Lyon: Édouard Herriot, leader of the Radical Socialist Party and minister without portfolio, gave a speech at the "Friends of the Soviet Union Association," saying, "War is now lurking beside us, and a little carelessness will lead to irreversible consequences. Fortunately, the League of Nations can guide us on the path to peace, and within the League of Nations, there is a great nation cooperating for peace, which is a fortunate thing in this unfortunate situation. I hope that France and Russia will continue to support each other, as they have for a long time. The Soviet people and their leaders are all friends of mine. What we want, in a nutshell, is to unite all the nations of the world to maintain peace. We may have reservations about certain people in certain countries and their political methods, but we should not blame their people for this. We will not allow anyone to use the power of the French Republic to oppress peace." (November 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>, economy of time, the ancient art of shrinking the land, is seen today. From Xi'an, take the Longhai Railway, then the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways, and return to Qingdao on October 13th. In each place passed, stay for three or four days in most, one or two days in few. The total travel time is exactly one month. I have spent half my life at sea, and have set foot in most places in the world with waterways, but this is my first time in the northwest of our country, and I feel endless interest. The places inspected on this trip include the five provinces of Shanxi, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, and Shaanxi. During the visit, I received warm hospitality from the local military and political leaders, providing me with various conveniences. Factories, handicrafts, and schools in all the cities were almost completely visited. Their kindness is deeply appreciated. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, many desired places could not be visited. Day after day on the road, what was seen was not in depth. I will discuss my personal observations and feelings in the following points. First, the greatness of ancient culture is admirable. The Northwest is the birthplace of the Chinese nation. The traces of the evolution of various ethnic cultures recorded in history can be found in the Northwest provinces. For example, in Xi'an City, there are still the old sites of Feng and Hao, the two capitals of the Zhou Dynasty. The Epang Palace of Qin can still be vaguely examined. The capitals of the Han and Tang Dynasties also left relics. Just by relying on broken tiles and bricks, one can imagine the magnificence of the ancient capitals. The beautiful origin of Chinese Buddhism, this is just in terms of all spiritual civilization. As for material civilization, there are also things that have been passed down for thousands of years, and are still sufficient to be used for the people's livelihood today. For example, in Ningxia's water conservancy projects, there are the Qin Canal, the Han Canal, and the Tang Canal, all of which were built by the Qin, Han, and Tang Dynasties. Their scale is grand, the length of the canals is hundreds of miles, and the short ones are also more than a hundred miles. Countless branch canals are opened on the sides, drawing water from the Yellow River to irrigate the fields. Farmers still benefit from it to this day. The design conforms to the terrain and follows the water's nature, which is very consistent with scientific methods, so the Yellow River water does not cause harm, but is turned into a benefit. The Yungang Grottoes in Datong have long been famous in the world. Their structure is carved from a single stone, carving Buddha statues in the rock between the rocks. The greatness of the project and the exquisiteness of the art, modern sculpture cannot surpass. Looking at the traces of history, it really gives people endless emotions. Second, the Northwest is vast and rich in resources, sufficient for development. The Northwest provinces are mostly vast and sparsely populated. For example, Suiyuan has an area of 1.17 million square miles and a population of only 2.1 million. Ningxia has an area of 800,000 square miles and a population of only 1.4 million. Gansu has an area of 1.1 million square miles and a population of only 6 million. Therefore, the population density of the three provinces is only two people per square mile, which is more than twenty times different compared to the southeastern provinces, which have forty or fifty people per square mile. Therefore, the Northwest only has geographical advantages, but lacks people to develop it. Along the way, wherever the rivers pass and the plains are located, the land is mostly fertile and the agricultural products are abundant. The mountain areas are mostly bare, but the forests cultivated in the Yin of Helan Mountain in ancient times still have towering trees, with ancient trees that can be embraced, which shows that the soil is suitable for afforestation. If artificial　planting is applied, then the timber will be inexhaustible. Currently, on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, once the bare mountains on both sides are washed by rain, the streams carry sediment into the river, causing the riverbed to silt up and flooding every year. If　trees are planted, then the roots will be intertwined, the soil will not be eroded, and the river can be dredged. Therefore, afforestation not only has the benefit of people's livelihood, but also can prevent the disasters of the Yellow River. The areas with water and grass in the Northwest are suitable for animal husbandry. Herds of cattle, sheep, horses, and camels, the resources needed for the leather and wool weaving industry, and the benefits relied on by the transportation industry, are the most important resources in the Northwest. This time, I visited the Xinong Company in Saxian, Suiyuan, which uses modern agricultural tools to develop vast lands, and also engages in animal husbandry, forestry, and textile industries. Its service providers are mostly specialized talents, adapting to local conditions, and the results are very good. Other places are no different. In short, the Northwest is rich in geographical advantages. Whether it is running agriculture and forestry, or organizing animal husbandry, or opening a wool weaving industry, as long as people can do their best, there will be good harvests. Currently, local officials can all pay attention to this. Even in an economically difficult environment, they still strive for development. In addition to the industry and commerce of Shanxi, which have been built for many years and are quite large in scale, Sui, Ning, Gan, and Shaanxi are also actively underway. However, based on my observations, I believe that there are three prerequisites for developing the resources of the Northwest. First, transportation. Currently, the PingSui Railway only reaches Baotou, and the Longhai Railway only reaches Xi'an. Efforts should be made to extend them separately, connecting Ningxia, Lanzhou, Xi'an and other places, so that the transportation in the Northwest provinces is like the meridians of the body, connected to each other. All local products, as well as imported raw materials and machinery, will be exported and imported, and the exchange will be smooth. Then, the industry will be easier to develop. Second, manpower. The Northwest has natural treasures, but lacks manpower to manage them. Therefore, it is necessary to first immigrate people from the interior to supplement the manpower, and to recruit technical personnel to organize and plan with scientific methods, and work together to manage them, so that development can be planned. Third, financial resources. The Northwest's geographical advantages have not been developed, the economy is difficult, transportation is inconvenient, and production is not easy. The government must advocate for fundraising from above, and the financial sector must assist from below. Officials and people of each province work together to make it have basic construction first, then the resources can be gradually developed. If these three, transportation, manpower, and financial resources, can be combined into one, then there is no need to worry that the land cannot be used to its full potential and the goods cannot flow smoothly. Third, regarding the climate and customs of the Northwest, before we went to the Northwest, we imagined that the place must be filled with cold wind and sand. But who knew that it was not so? Most of the places I passed through were too warm, just like the interior. The winter clothes I brought were all useless. The dialects of Fujian and Guangdong cannot be understood, and there are no major differences in customs and habits. This is the case for the Han people, as well as the Mongolians and Hui people. In recent years, local officials have actively paid attention to education, and there are many schools in the provincial capitals. If transportation develops further, the contribution to culture will also be very great. As for the problem of the Red Bandits scurrying and attacking, apart from a part in northern Shaanxi, the rest once fled to the northwest through the southern border of Gansu. The area of Gansu and Shaanxi is vast and the mountain roads are rugged, and although it is a little difficult to encircle and suppress them, Chiang Kai-shek has established a bandit suppression headquarters in Xi'an, and has established command posts in Chongqing and Yichang, combining the large armies of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ning, Sichuan, and Hubei to jointly suppress them. It is believed that the fleeing Red Bandits will have nowhere to escape. Currently, the Northwest is sparsely populated, it is not easy to obtain food, and the people hate the cruelty of the communists extremely. No matter what threats or inducements are used, they cannot use their tricks. It is thought that they will be completely eliminated in the shortest time.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Current Status of the Yuehan Railway Project <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The entire line is scheduled to be completed by the end of next year. Currently, 201 kilometers are open to traffic.</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondent: The Yuehan Railway is a major line connecting the north and south. Construction began in the 24th year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty. The entire line is 1,096 kilometers long. The section from Guangzhou to Shaozhou is 222 kilometers, and it was opened to traffic in the 4th year of the Republic of China. The section from Wuchang Xujiapeng to Zhuzhou in Hunan Province is 417 kilometers, and it was also opened to traffic in the 7th year of the Republic of China. The middle section from Zhuzhou to Shaozhou is 456 kilometers long. Due to the difficulty of the work and the large amount of funds required, it was suspended for many years. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, the central government decided to use Boxer Indemnity funds for the construction of the road, so the Zhushao Section Engineering Bureau was established in Guangzhou, and Ling Hongxun was appointed as the director. The first section to be built was from Shaozhou to Lechang, which is 50 kilometers long. Construction started in the 19th year and was completed and opened to traffic in June of the 22nd year. In September of that year, the Engineering Bureau moved from Guangdong to Hengyang in Hunan Province, and actively planned the construction work. It was divided into three sections, north, south, and middle, and carried out simultaneously. It was originally limited to four years to complete, and then Tai Ling reduced the knowledge by half a year, limited to the end of the 25th year of the Republic of China to complete and open to traffic.</p>
<p>Sectional Construction</p>
<p>For the convenience of construction, the Engineering Bureau divided it into seven general sections. The first general section is from Shaozhou to Lechang, 50 kilometers (completed and open to traffic). The second general section is from Lechang to Luojiadu, a little over 46 kilometers (completed). The third general section is from Luojiadu to Shuitoudong, a little over 66 kilometers. The fourth general section is from Shuitoudong to Gaotingsi, a little over 59 kilometers (currently under construction). The fifth general section is from Gaotingsi to Guanyinqiao, 75 kilometers (two-thirds completed). The sixth general section is from Guanyinqiao to Fengtang, a little over 67 kilometers (one-third completed). The seventh general section is from Fengtang to Zhuzhou, 90 kilometers (eighty-nine tenths completed). In total, about 76 percent of the entire project has been completed.</p>
<p>Track Laying Situation</p>
<p>The southern section is being laid northwards from Lechang, the middle section is being laid southwards from the south bank of the Lei River in Chongzhou territory, and the northern section is being laid southwards from Zhuzhou. Because the Lu River Bridge has not yet been completed, the southern section is being laid southward across the Lu River. It is estimated that by the end of August next year, it will be laid to the border between Hunan and Guangdong provinces, and will connect with the middle section. The middle section reached Leiyang from the south of the Lei River in mid-August this year. It is estimated that it will reach Chenzhou in February next year, and will connect with the southern section in August. The northern section has reached Lukou this year from the south of Zhuzhou, and will continue to advance south from Lukou. By the end of this month, it can reach Shishan Hengshan, and it is estimated that it will reach the north bank of the Lei River in June next year, and will connect with the middle section.</p>
<p>Bridges and Tunnels The entire line passes through the three tributaries of the Lu, Mi, and Lei rivers. There are three steel bridges built, each with a length of more than three or four meters. There are also five large arch bridges, including the Xin Yan Xia Bridge with six arches, 190 meters long, the Duiwei Chong Bridge with two arches, 105 meters long, the Provincial Border Bridge with three arches, 105 meters long, the Fengchui Kou Bridge with three arches, 88 meters long, and the Yantang Bridge with two arches, 75 meters long. All projects have been completed by six or seven tenths. There are also 17 tunnels in the southern section, the longest being more than 400 meters long and the shortest being 46 meters long, all of which have now been completed.</p>
<p>Traffic Situation</p>
<p>The completed sections of the Yuehan Road have been opened to traffic in sections by engineering trains, and passenger and freight business is being handled. The northern section from Zhuzhou to Lukou, Lukou to Zhaoling, was opened to traffic in March and May of this year, with a total length of 66 kilometers. The middle section from the south bank of the Lei River to Leiyang, was opened to traffic in mid-August, with a length of 79 kilometers. The southern section from Shaozhou to Lechang, 50 kilometers, has long been open to traffic. From Lechang to Pingshi, 56 kilometers, was opened to traffic in September of this year. At the same time, in order to facilitate traffic, the Hunan-Guangdong Road Administration Bureau and the Hunan and Guangdong Provincial Highway Bureaus jointly organized the Yuehan entire line railway and highway intermodal transport, and preparations are complete and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Guangdong Provincial Construction Bonds Postponed <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The face value of the bonds has also been finally decided. The operating profits of the cement plant will be used as a fund.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondent: Since the bankruptcy of the Guangdong National and Two Banks in Guangdong Province, the social finance has been greatly affected, and the capital of various places is short. However, the credit of the provincial bank notes is consolidated, and it is also planning to expand the currency, and decided to expand the scope of circulation of the provincial bank haoquan to regulate the rural economy of various counties and cities. On the one hand, it welcomes the investment of Shanghai's silver industry in rural industries. At the same time, in order to actively handle the construction of the entire province, the government issued construction bonds of 5 million yuan, originally scheduled to be issued on August 1, but due to the rush to print, it has been postponed to December 1. Previously, the face value of the bonds was planned to be divided into four types: 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. Recently, it has been decided to change the small denominations into larger ones, and the face value has been changed to three types: 100 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan, to facilitate sales. It is now found that the bonds with a face value of 100 yuan are printed in 20,000 sheets, totaling 2 million yuan; the bonds with a face value of 1,000 yuan are printed in 1,000 sheets, totaling 2 million yuan; the bonds with a face value of 10,000 yuan are printed in 100 sheets, totaling 1 million yuan. This bond is printed by the Shanghai Commercial Press, and will be transported to Guangdong within days. In the future, half of the bonds will be sold by Shanghai banks. The total amount of the bonds is 5 million yuan, with a fixed interest rate of 7 percent per year. The operating profits of the Guangdong Xicun Shimin 10th factory will be used as a fund to form a fund management committee. The remaining profits of the factory will be allocated to the committee every month for special reserves. The Guangdong Provincial Bank will be responsible for the repayment of principal and interest. The repayment period is from May 25th of the Republic of China to November 29th, repaying in five years. As for the use of the bond funds, they will be used to expand Guangdong's sugar factories, textile factories, fertilizer factories, and to establish paper mills and soda factories. May of next year will be the first time for drawing lots to repay the principal and pay interest. After that, lotteries will be held every five months to repay the principal and pay interest. It is estimated that the principal and interest can be repaid by November 29th. This case was presented to the Nanjing Executive Yuan by the Guangdong Provincial Government in May of this year, requesting that it be allowed to issue in accordance with the precedent of the construction bonds issued by Zhejiang and Hunan provinces. The Executive Yuan replied by telegram, stating that the case had been approved by the 38th Yuan affairs meeting and sent to the Central Political Conference for approval. On July 13, a telegram was received from the Legislative Yuan, stating that the case had been jointly presented to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and had been passed by the Central Political Conference and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Guangdong Provincial Government recently reported to the Executive Yuan again for the record the reasons for postponing the issuance to December 1 due to the time required for printing the bonds. Yesterday, it received a reply from the Yuan, approving the implementation. (October 26th)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Escaped Prisoner Captured and Sent to Songjiang</p>
<p>Zhong Shaoyun, the bandit involved in the Huang Guoxiang case in Shanjiaqiao, a county under the jurisdiction of the former, was sentenced to 15 years in prison by the court and sent to prison. Unexpectedly, he escaped from prison on March 18. He had been wanted for a long time without success. Until recently, he was spotted in the Jiaofu teahouse in Shanyang. Because the prisoner had a record of escaping from prison, he was arrested. He has now been sent to Songjiang and returned to the local court for retrial.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Silver and Money Industry Calls Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The silver and money industries in Suzhou received a telegram from the Shanghai Banking Association on the evening of the 4th, stating that the Ministry of Finance was implementing the legal tender system. Special emergency meetings were convened by the banking and money industries respectively at 9:00 am on the 5th to discuss everything. Since there is no branch of the Central Bank in Suzhou, the exchange of legal tender will be handled by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. According to people in the money industry, the silver reserves of the silver and money industries in Suzhou are about 300,000 yuan. The exchange rate of various cigarette stores inside and outside the city on the evening of the 4th was 3,400 copper coins per yuan. Small foreign coins could be exchanged for 12 jiao and 250. From 8:00 am on the 5th, there was a sudden chaos, and the exchange rates varied. Some even removed the foreign exchange price signs. By noon, it had calmed down a little. The exchange rate was 3,000 copper coins per yuan, and small foreign coins were 12 jiao. In order to stabilize the market, the county government decided to hold a meeting with representatives from the county chamber of commerce and the silver and money industries to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Copper Coins Suddenly Plunge on the Market</p>
<p>After the news that the Ministry of Finance stipulated that banknotes from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were legal tender reached Wuxi, people on the market told each other. It was expected that the market for copper coins would take a sharp turn for the worse. Before the opening of the copper coin market in the morning, those with good information bought up copper coins, making huge profits. At noon, the Money Industry Association discussed the market. The purchase price of copper coins was 3,000 wen, and the selling price was 2,990 wen, which was 260 wen more than yesterday, which was a dramatic change that broke the record. The market for small foreign coins, yesterday's purchase price was 759, and the selling price was 763. Yesterday's purchase price was 77 percent, and the selling price was 77.4 percent, with each jiao worth 203 wen.</p>
<p>Silk Cocoon Prices Soar</p>
<p>Since the autumn of this year, the European and American markets have suddenly seen active Chinese silk. Foreign firms stationed in Shanghai are also purchasing Chinese silk, leading to soaring silk prices. The current price per dan for silk of the highest grade has risen to 850 yuan in national currency, which is more than double the previous silk price. This has not happened since 1930. Silk factories and silk merchants in various places have made huge profits, especially Yongtai in our county and Baotai in Shanghai. The price of dried cocoons has risen to 270 yuan per dan. At the same time, silk cocoon by-products have also risen. There are currently about 12,000 silk reeling machines in our county. Assuming that each machine uses 4 jin of cocoons per day, 412 dan of dried cocoons are needed every day. It is found that the cocoons stored in warehouses and stockers throughout the county are only enough for the factories for one month, and the dried cocoons in the hands of the stockers are waiting for a good price. Therefore, by the end of this month, various factories will reduce the number of machines they operate to maintain business.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Female Political Police Transferred to the General Bureau for Service</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Bureau's political police training class, the first class of political police, graduated last year and have now been dispatched to serve in various places. The second class began training in May of this year, with a total of 50 male and female police officers. They were sent to various sub-bureaus for two weeks of practical training at the beginning of last month, and the term has now expired. A graduation ceremony was held a few days ago and certificates were issued. The General Bureau, headed by Director Chuan, will transfer a part of the female police officers in this class to the General Bureau for service. It is reported that the class was ordered to transfer all the female police officers to the General Bureau for service on the 4th.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>County Magistrate Personally Destroys Red Pill Factory</p>
<p>Lu Bingzhong, a resident of Yangjian Town, which is located at the junction of Xichang, secretly set up a large-scale red pill manufacturing factory, selling and transporting it to Xichang, Suzhou, Cheng, and other areas. The business was very prosperous. In the summer of this year, Lu was arrested and sent to the province. On September 18, he was executed by shooting in the town. His son, Lu Fenglin, who had been on the run, is still hiding in the countryside and manufacturing privately. The authorities have been investigating repeatedly for more than two months. A few days ago, Sun Daxing, Zhang Xiqing, and other investigators secretly dispatched by the county disguised themselves as sailors and arrived in the countryside to Lu's place.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Jiangsu Gentry Please Block the Yellow River Breach</p>
<p>Korean Jun, Ma Shijie, Leng Yu, and Zhang Yipeng, gentry from Jiangsu, submitted a joint request to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Relief Committee, and the Economic Committee regarding the Dongzhuang Yellow River breach, stating that on July 10 of this year, the Huangnan Zhulin Dyke between Heze and Juancheng in western Shandong had not yet been completed, and the Min Nian Guandi under Dongzhuang suddenly breached one, two, three, four, and five mouths, diverting seventy-eight tenths of the Yellow River water and pouring down. The breach reached dozens or hundreds of feet. Tracing back to the Lisheng Tun breach in 1925, it still returned to the main river at Taojiabu, and the disaster area did not expand. This time the situation is different. The water divides into two branches, flowing northeast and southeast, entering the Dongping and Weishan Lakes, and advancing from western Shandong to northern Jiangsu. Recently, because the Yishui and Wenshui rivers in southern Shandong were flooded by the Yellow River water, the disaster area in northern Jiangsu is twice as large as that in western Shandong. The autumn harvest is reduced, and spring farming is hopeless. Therefore, Jun and others only hope to block the breach. It is expected that the authorities will never procrastinate or underestimate the breach. Now, there are less than three months before the ice melts. If the surveying, planning, funding, personnel, materials, and all matters that should be handled can be completed by the time of the Frost's Descent solar term, waiting for the water level to drop, working day and night, there may be hope of closing the gap before the ice melts. It is also said that the Yellow River migrated north to Jiangsu only eighty years ago, and a part of the riverbank is in danger. The guards have prior responsibility and contingency plans. If there is danger, the river should be diverted. Then, in the four thousand years of the Yellow River, there have been no less than six changes, and the north-south division has been a precedent since the Song Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty. Based on the history of the Yellow River breach in 1933, it is requested that the supervision and control of breach blocking and diversion be implemented separately, which is a virtue and convenience.</p>
<p>Contact was made to purchase a large number of red pills. Lu believed it to be true, and agreed to deliver the goods at Yanjiaqiao on the third night at 11:00 pm. The investigators found out the truth and immediately reported it to the county government by telephone. At 9:00 pm, County Magistrate Zhai personally led Geng Boyang, the head of the Anti-Smoking Section, and 40 security team members, including all the bailiffs, to the village in three large trucks overnight, surrounded Lu's factory, arrested the principal offender Lu Fenglin, his wife Zhou, and two accomplices, and returned to the city that night. From 2:00 am to 9:00 am on the 4th, County Magistrate asked Lu personally. Lu admitted to manufacturing red pills without denial, and said that the raw materials were purchased through Chen Junying's introduction. The county government will now transfer the case to the provincial garrison headquarters for review.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The National Situation of Abyssinia <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Ang Ro</p>
<p>——Race, Politics, Military——</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Abyssinia is an ancient feudal country. Almost all the people in the country are illiterate, there are virtually no roads, and the annual foreign trade is less than 25 million U.S. dollars. The Abyssinian natives rule many dependent tribes, and those belonging to the ancient Abyssinian race probably account for no more than one-third of the total population. The rest do not believe in any Christian religion, nor do they speak Amharic. The Abyssinian natives live in the central plateau, while the dependent tribes live in the surrounding lowlands. It is difficult to determine the total population, and estimates generally range from 5 million to 20 million. Scholars familiar with the Abyssinian national situation estimate it to be between 7 and 8 million. However, any statistics on Abyssinia are scarce and completely unreliable.</p>
<p>The racially complex people of the Abyssinian Empire can be distinguished in several ways. Physical characteristics are the most difficult to rely on. The Abyssinian natives consider themselves to belong to the white race and are descendants of the North African Hamitic people. This is correct, but thousands of years of contact with black people in Central and East Africa have dyed their skin coffee-colored, or even a dark chocolate color.</p>
<p>Language is a more reliable standard for distinguishing ethnic groups. The people of the central plateau speak a Semitic language. The Galla people, who live in the south of the central region, are black and have their own language. They migrated from the south in the early modern period. They also account for one-third of the total population. The remaining one-third is divided into several small tribes, scattered in the border provinces of Danakil, Somalia, and Sidamo. Based on this linguistic distinction, we can say that the one-third of the population in the highlands (Semitic) rules the two-thirds of the population in the lowlands (non-Semitic).</p>
<p>Religion is also a way to distinguish ethnic groups. The Abyssinian natives are Christians, but at least nominally some of the Galla people have also converted to Christianity. The total number of Christians accounts for about half of the total population. Muslims account for three-eighths and live in the east and southeast. In addition, there are the Falasha people—Abyssinian Jews—about 100,000 to 200,000 people, whose Jewish teachings are very corrupt and who do not understand Hebrew. The rest of the people are non-religious.</p>
<p>The Christians in Abyssinia belong to the ancient Egyptian Church. The archbishop is appointed by the patriarch of Alexandria and is often an Egyptian. The Abyssinian emperor wants to replace him with a local, but it is not easy to break the customs in Abyssinia, so he has to set up several local bishops to assist him. There are many pastors, some say they account for one-third of the adult population. This is of course an exaggeration, but in a static society (such as Tibet), the number of people who hold world-weary ideas must exceed the needs of the church. The pastors in Abyssinia are rich in land. They are uneducated and quite superstitious. They have thus created a great conservative force. For 1,500 years, religion has been a great force in maintaining Abyssinia's independence.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>The Abyssinian Empire is the best example of a feudal state today. The society within its borders is based on strict layers of classes, each class having its traditional economic and political functions. The foundation of the social organization is military. Those who can lead troops against the enemy in wartime are the national elite and receive the supreme honor of the country. In peacetime, these soldiers are the officials who govern the country. This system has been passed down for centuries without much change. Before the end of the 19th century, Abyssinia was isolated from the outside world. However, in the 16th century, it was briefly invaded by the Portuguese, but only for a short time. By the reign of Menelik (Emperor Menelik died in 1913), Western civilization had invaded Abyssinia again. However, to this day, this force has only reached the king's side. Although the king has tried his best to reform, he is still inflexible.</p>
<p>The current Emperor Haile Selassie is implementing a system of centralized monarchy. In the past, unless the monarch was as powerful as Menelik, the feudal lords of the four directions often wanted to become arrogant and not be restrained by their nominal monarch. Because the territory was vast and mountainous, local ideas developed, and mutual suspicion often made it difficult for weak leaders to rule. The current emperor's centralization movement has achieved great success. Several hereditary feudal lords have already submitted, and those who are not supervised by the capital have been replaced by the king.</p>
<p>After Menelik's death, the disintegrating monarchy is now gradually recovering. This movement took a sharp turn in 1926 due to the death of Grand Marshal Fivives. Fivives commanded the national army for 30 years. Once he died, Crown Prince Tafari Makonnen (now the Emperor) seized the opportunity to seize his fiefdom, take over his military power, and merge it with his hereditary Harar province army, leaping to become the most powerful prince in Abyssinia. He made a thunderous announcement to the feudal lords who had the same right to inherit the throne, expressing his determination to take power alone. In 1928, Empress Zewditu (Menelik's daughter) made him king. In 1930, the empress died and he ascended the throne, with the national title Haile Selassie. In 1932, General Hailu of the once independent Gojjam province rebelled, and the king sent troops to put him down. Thus, the most important and fertile area located in the loop of the Blue Nile also came under the jurisdiction of the central government. However, on the whole, the hereditary feudal lords have not abolished their fiefdoms, and the centralization movement is limited to the eastern and southern border provinces, where the people are mostly Muslims or non-religious, and the land was only conquered during Menelik's reign, so there has not been time for assimilation.</p>
<p>Abyssinia also has a constitution, which was promulgated by the emperor in 1931. The constitution also stipulates that the "Parliament" must meet regularly. It is needless to say that this "Parliament" cannot be compared with the legislative bodies of European and American democratic countries. The so-called "representatives" have no power to supervise legislation and administration. Their terms of office are completely controlled by the king. This "Parliament" can only be regarded as a registry. If the king has an edict to make known at home and abroad, he will personally announce it at this "Parliament." These members of parliament cannot be regarded as representing the ignorant masses of Abyssinia. At best, they can only be regarded as representing the feudal lords.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Because Abyssinia is a feudal state, even a powerful king must rely on the cooperation of the feudal lords to resist foreign aggression. In theory, every soldier in Abyssinia must be loyal to the king, but this is not always the case. The king is high above, and the power of the government has not been completely centralized. The soldiers are only controlled by the feudal lords. Although the feudal lords cannot rebel, they can still sabotage the central government's plans through passive resistance.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent reports that many border chiefs have surrendered to the Italian army, but this cannot be without considerable conditions. This kind of thing of buying over the Abyssinian dependent tribes has always failed in the past. At the end of the 19th century, the Italians secretly helped King Menelik of Shoa to resist King Yohannes. In 1889, Yohannes died, and Menelik succeeded to the throne and implemented an anti-Italian policy. After that, Italian Prime Minister Crispi wanted to instigate a rebellion by the northern dependent tribes, but in the Battle of Adwa, the northern feudal lords all worked for Menelik and defeated the Italian army. This is a prominent historical example.</p>
<p>The Abyssinian army is an outdated force. If there were no dangerous terrain as a natural barrier, it would be difficult to maintain national independence.</p>
<p>The Abyssinian Imperial Guard is the only modern force, with a strength of about 2,500 to 30,000 men. Since 1929, this army has been trained by Belgian and Swedish officers. They wear uniforms, are barefoot, carry modern weapons, and drill according to military science. This army can be said to be a strong force. The emperor is unwilling to send them to the front unless it is a critical moment.</p>
<p>In addition to the Imperial Guard, the emperor also has his own Imperial Army, which is composed of armed subjects within his jurisdiction. The current emperor's jurisdiction includes the three provinces of Harar, Wollo, and Shoa. These Imperial Armies are stationed in various places, serving as guards and enforcing edicts. There are no accurate statistics on the number of Imperial Armies, probably between 50,000 and 100,000. This kind of army can only be regarded as a mixed army in other countries. Their military equipment and organization are very outdated.</p>
<p>The feudal lords' conscription is also the same outdated. All able-bodied men must join the army. Only monks, priests, merchants, shepherds, and guards of noble women can be exempted from military service. If the population decreases in the future, these people will inevitably have their exemption qualifications revoked.</p>
<p>There are different opinions on the actual number of troops that the emperor can mobilize. Some say that one million people have already been mobilized. This is probably an exaggeration. There may be this number of people in service, but the overall mobilization, supplies, and weapons are insufficient, which is detrimental to the military. Therefore, mobilizing 500,000 people is probably closer to the truth. Eritrean former governor 石禮 estimated that Abyssinia could mobilize at most 250,000 troops to the front line. In Tigray Province, supplies are difficult, and it would be unwise for Abyssinia to concentrate a large army. ;</p>
<p>It is also difficult to count Abyssinia's military equipment. There are probably 500,000 to 600,000 rifles of various types, hundreds of machine guns, and dozens of cannons. The so-called cannons are probably just exhibits in museums. Although there are a few airplanes, they cannot be used for combat. There are certainly no gas equipment, tank fleets, and other modern tactical weapons.</p>
<p>In terms of military equipment, although Abyssinia is far inferior to the Italian army, it has several advantages. First, they have the advantage of terrain. Second, they are familiar with the terrain for combat. Third, their actions are more convenient than the enemy's. They do not need auxiliary teams that European military departments consider indispensable, such as baggage trains and ambulance teams. The Abyssinian army does not need to bring much food and pay for its progress, and they can eat on the spot. This is very convenient for a quick battle. The Italian army, which is accustomed to European life, cannot eat African food, so it must bring enough bulky military supplies. The Abyssinian army does not have front-line hospitals or rear-line hospitals. Women servants who go out with the army to bandage wounds must help themselves.</p>
<p>In a protracted war, this advantage in mobility loses its value. The food requisitioned on the spot will soon run out, and the courage of the armies collected from various places will also decline. Moreover, Abyssinians are unwilling to leave their homes for several months. They are especially unhappy about joining the army during the rainy season. What they hope for is a victory in one battle. Once the enemy army is defeated, they will disperse and return home, no longer eager to take advantage of the victory. The defeats of the Egyptian army in Gonder and Gura in 1875, and the defeat of the Italian army in Adwa in 1896, all came to an abrupt end in this way. If the Abyssinians still have this old temper in this war, then when the rainy season arrives, we will see hundreds of thousands of Italian troops stationed in the Abyssinian mountains, but no Abyssinian army fighting against them. However, Mussolini has various concerns, and his military operations cannot last for a long time. (Excerpt from RcbertGajcWoolbert's thesis)</p>

<p>Jiangbei Remote Ports Blockaded</p>
<p>The small and remote ports along the river and sea in the six counties under the jurisdiction of Nantong District are being blockaded by the public security teams of the District Security Command, both on water and land, to prevent bandits from intruding. The blockade will remain in effect until the end of the winter defense period, and will then be lifted. The Department of Civil Affairs is also adding patrol boats and assigning them to the command of the First Water Police District.</p>

<p>Yongxing Town Pillaged by Bandits</p>
<p>Yongxing Town in Qidong was suddenly attacked by more than 20 bandits armed with box guns at around 7:00 PM on the first day of the month. They broke into various shops and looted them at will. The Huang Yuantai Yuchunxiang, Ding Taiyuan, and Zhu Julang families suffered the heaviest losses. ...... They marched north in formation. Many villagers beat gongs to pursue and arrest them. ...... They shot and wounded four people: Zhang Zhiren, Lu Baohua, Lu Hongfu, and Lu Shun. Zhang Zhiren died soon after due to excessive blood loss. On the morning of the second day, the merchants of the town reported the incident to the Qidong County Government. County Magistrate Li personally inspected the scene and instructed the merchants to continue their business as usual. The family members of the deceased were instructed to prepare coffins and bury the body. At the same time, the police were ordered to strictly arrest the bandits and bring them to justice for interrogation.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Gangster Group Arrested and Paraded</p>
<p>Sixteen people, including orderlies from government offices and corrupt police officers, swore blood oaths and formed a secret society called the "We Ethnic Group Affectionate Society." Even female gangsters like Mao Wenying joined the group. It was reported that their subordinates and henchmen numbered in the hundreds, and that they had elected a certain Lu as their leader. Two photos of the group were also submitted for verification. Director Yu was furious upon receiving the report. He pointed out that with the winter defense period about to begin, these gangsters dared to form secret societies, which would inevitably lead to trouble. He personally issued an order to all sub-bureaus and teams to strictly investigate and arrest them by name and send them for investigation. Subsequently, the sub-bureaus and teams successively arrested six male and female gangsters and sent them to the bureau. After interrogation, they were ordered to denounce their accomplices. In the afternoon, the six men and women were bound and paraded through the streets as a warning. Meanwhile, the remaining criminals and their ringleaders were still being strictly apprehended to maintain social security.</p>
<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>Police Training Institute to be Re-established</p>
<p>County Magistrate Wang Hao of this county, in view of the past corruption of police affairs, has decided to re-establish the Police Training Institute to cultivate police talent. Starting today, recruitment will begin. A total of 30 male police officers and 5 female police officers are needed. Registration will be open until the 15th of this month, and the examination will be held on the 16th. The instructors have been appointed as Wang Yixing and Zhou Dun. It is said that female police officers are treated better and their work is simpler.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Incoming Mail: A Humble Opinion on Salt Administration Reform <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Li Youyi</p>
<p>(Continued from Part Three)</p>
<p>(4) Appropriately reduce the salt tax and rectify smuggling suppression so that no grain of illegally produced salt escapes and tax revenue can still maintain its original state. Salt tax is a major source of national income. Besides customs duties, salt tax is the most important. Recent average figures are about 13 to 14 million yuan. The reason for such a huge amount is because the tax is fixed. Unlike other goods, which are taxed a few percent of their assessed value, let us try to compare the price sold by salt farmers with the tax. In areas with heavy taxes, it is almost ten times the price, and in lighter areas, it is several times. Even in terms of the selling price, the tax accounts for most of it. This is truly a deformed method of taxation. Some may think that although salt is necessary for people, the amount consumed is very small and the impact on livelihoods is light. It doesn't hurt to increase the tax and make the people bear it universally. However, I do not know that this burden falls particularly heavily on the poor. It is appropriate to reduce it to alleviate their plight. In this autumn of national events and urgent need for money, even if it cannot be taxed a few percent of the assessed value like other goods, it is appropriate to carefully consider possible methods to reduce it. The new salt law stipulates a tax of five yuan per 100 kilograms, and all surcharges are waived. A kilogram is larger than a market catty, and each dan is about two market catties. The tax rate is thus reduced a lot, which can be said to benefit the poor a lot (but the price paid to salt farmers should be raised even higher). Some may argue that with the treasury strapped for cash, reducing the salt tax will only make the Ministry of Agriculture look up at the roof and struggle to cope. I would say that the only way to remedy this is to earnestly rectify smuggling suppression and eliminate all private sales in the country, so that the tax lost to illegal sales can be used to offset the reduction. Let us elaborate on this point. China's population is over 470 million (according to statistics from the Ministry of Interior), and based on the amount of salt consumed per person, each person consumes about five coins of salt per day, which amounts to one catty per month and twelve catties per year. Multiplying this by the population of 470 million, the total annual sales of salt can reach 56.4 million dan (and that doesn't include salt used in agriculture and industry, fishing salt, pickling, vegetable sales, and sauce sales). Based on the new salt law's tax rate of five yuan per dan, the annual revenue can be 182 million yuan. As mentioned earlier, the average salt tax revenue in recent years is about that amount. According to the statistics of the auditing office, the total amount of salt sold by the government in recent years is weak at an average of 37 million dan (including salt used in agriculture and industry, fishing salt, pickling, vegetable sales, and sauce sales). Compared with the sales based on the amount of salt consumed per person, there is a shortage of about 19 million dan. That is to say, the amount of salt sold privately throughout the country is about that number. Every year, about 95 million yuan in salt tax is lost. Even if the tax rate per kilogram stipulated in the [Salt] Law were halved, it would not break the average number of current income. Strict smuggling suppression is indeed the key to remedy. Please further discuss the disadvantages of illegal salt as follows: The value of table salt includes the majority of central and local surcharges, followed by transportation costs, and then by all expenses. The purchase price of salt is very low. The profit from private sales is that they are avoiding significant taxes, and even if they are caught by the smuggling suppression team after ten trips, they can still make a profit. The implementation of smuggling suppression in various provinces has always been corrupt, and the firearms are not complete. The large gangs of salt smugglers are all powerful figures with sophisticated firearms. It is easy to arrest fixed bandits. Moreover, after the smugglers are arrested and interrogated, they are sent to the county courts for trial. Although there are laws against smuggling to base on, county courts are not aware of salt matters and often consider it as a case of trying to make a living by evading taxes, so the sentences are reduced or even pardoned out of pity. Smugglers have high profits to gain and no strict laws to fear, so they are unscrupulous and the number of smugglers is increasing day by day (in 1933, when salt affairs administration was transferred to the auditing office and the offices for hearing salt cases were cut off, I once sent a letter to the Salt Affairs Office to discuss the advantages and disadvantages. At that time, the director of the Salt Affairs Office, Zhu Tingqi, seemed to adopt the idea and asked the deputy of Songjiang to review it, but it was rejected due to lack of funds). In this transition period of reform, I believe that we should revise the laws for the punishment of smugglers through the Legislative Yuan, pay attention to the judicial organs, and also heavily revise the regulations for smuggling suppression, practice reorganizing the national smuggling suppression team, and purchase sophisticated firearms to enrich its strength (although the Ministry of Finance previously formed a tax police regiment in the Song District, it is only limited to one corner, and I heard that it has not been used to replace the old smuggling suppression team for smuggling suppression). The production areas are garrisoned near the location, and the sales areas are stationed on the borders of each district, so that smugglers cannot escape the net. Arrest and severely punish the offenders to serve as a warning. Then, reduce the tax and reduce the price to combat private sales. Again, raise the price of salt to maintain the livelihood of salt farmers so that they are not happy to sell privately. Treat the root and the branches, and proceed on both sides. If we can earnestly reorganize and implement it for several years, I do not believe that smugglers will not be eliminated. The government will not only gain the reputation of benefiting the poor, but also will not lose the revenue from salt tax. I sincerely hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible, and the blessings will spread to the common people, which will bring infinite benefits to the country and society. (5) Formulate methods for merchants to pay taxes and contract transportation in order to facilitate tax collection. Article 1 of the general principles of the New Salt Law (Salt is taxed at the location, allowing the people to buy freely, and no one should monopolize it.) According to the meaning of taxing at the location, when salt farmers produce table salt, they should pay taxes before they are allowed to sell it. Since salt farmers have no untaxed salt, private salt will naturally be eliminated. It is indeed a good strategy to prevent private sales. However, it is difficult to do this in reality because salt farmers are all poor and have no ability to pay taxes. It is still necessary for merchants to pay taxes. That is to say, salt merchants who contract transportation must first pay taxes and prepay packaging and transportation costs, and all expenses must be pre-paid by those who are wealthy. The government can fix the sales amount in each district and recruit merchants to contract transportation, and pay the tax first according to the number, and not allow them to change transportation without authorization. This will not only continuously provide people with food, but also obtain the entire tax revenue. Some may argue that contracting transportation may still follow the same path of exclusive merchants, but it is not known that exclusive merchants rely on the Qing Dynasty's paper permit as a hereditary occupation. If they do not willingly sell the permit to others, even the wealthy cannot engage in salt trade. They rely on it and monopolize it very much. They manipulate it and think that no one else can do it. Even if the government knows it, it cannot cancel its business and find a replacement. If it is changed to contracting transportation and strictly supervised, there will be no way to monopolize it. Even if there is fraud, the punishment will be light and another merchant will be recruited to continue the contract. Merchants have considerable benefits, and there is nothing more stable than the salt business. Those who seek profits with money will undoubtedly rush to it. The disease of the old system lies in giving special exclusive privileges and setting low salt prices. Natural wealth comes to people, and for a long time, those with long sleeves are good at dancing. Since the Qing Dynasty, all salt merchants have amassed wealth. Those who are good at planning gain even more profits and take the world's benefits as their own. This is what is criticized by the world. However, salt tax revenue cannot be scattered and difficult to manage. The disease is recognized by the government to be where exclusive merchants are located and the old system is to be abolished. Then, the detailed methods for paying taxes and contracting transportation will be set in order to facilitate tax collection. As for the government's occasional emergency needs, it used to collect and borrow from salt merchants in advance. This was originally an expedient measure for temporary relief and should not be regarded as a normal practice. Moreover, this kind of action is not only a foolish policy of financial overdraft, but it is also enough to inspire merchants to hope for non-profits, which is not appropriate.</p>
<p>In summary, it can not only remove all the difficulties in implementing the new salt law, but also not be stubborn and difficult to implement. I believe that it is the best method for the initial reform in the transition period from the old to the new. As for the salt administration policy after the national treasury is abundant in the future, it is better to adopt Liu Yan's method of salt administration: people produce, officials collect, and merchants transport. Although it cannot be tax-free like in ancient times, it should be set at the lightest tax rate so that most of the salt profits belong to the people and are popularized. This is the final ending of thoroughly governing salt. Because the salt problem has a profound impact on everyone's interests, and looking around at people in the community, many still regard it indifferently. Since I know something, I cannot remain silent, so I do not hesitate to speak in detail. The people of the country should pay attention to it.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Citizen and the Law (Part 2) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Bin, Member of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>(Lectures given to the national public on October 30th and October 1st)</p>
<p>(4) The Rights People Should Legally Enjoy</p>
<p>What is called a right? A right is the power granted by law to a specific person to enrich their recognized interests. To break it down into two aspects: The content of a right is the interest recognized by law. The form of a right is the power granted by law. With this legal power, one can thoroughly assert their claims and obtain legal benefits. The rights enjoyed by the people are diverse, with the most important ones stipulated in the constitution. The constitutions of various countries are generally similar. The constitutional provisions regarding the rights of the people are sometimes designed solely to restrict the executive and judicial powers to prevent them from infringing upon the people. Others are designed solely to restrict the legislative power to prevent it from infringing upon the people. In most countries, the constitutional articles include phrases such as "the freedom of the people shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law," and "the people shall have a certain freedom within the scope of the law." These wordings are designed to restrict the executive and judicial powers because the enactment of laws is the prerogative of the legislative body. If the legislative body has not enacted a specific law to restrict the rights of the people, the executive or judicial bodies have no basis to arbitrarily restrict the rights of the people through orders or judgments. The U.S. Constitution, in its amendments added in 1791, states that "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." Article 25 of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China states that "laws restricting the rights and freedoms of the people shall be limited to those necessary to safeguard national security, avert imminent danger, maintain social order, or promote public interest." These wordings are designed to restrict the legislative power because, although the legislative body has the power to enact laws, it shall not arbitrarily enact laws to restrict any freedom or right of the people if such restriction is not necessary. If the executive, judicial, or legislative bodies violate these provisions, the laws they enact shall be invalid, and the dispositions or judgments they make shall be revoked. The people, for the harm they suffer as a result, may also request compensation in accordance with the law. This is what is meant by the statement that rights are protected by the constitution. The Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China and the draft constitution prepared by the Legislative Yuan stipulate the basic rights of the people, which can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>1.  The right to equality, which means that all citizens of the Republic of China are equal before the law, regardless of gender, race, religion, or class. The meaning of equality has already been discussed above.</p>
<p>2.  The right to freedom, which means the right of the people to be free from interference in their person, property, speech, etc., except within the scope prescribed by law. The person of the people shall not be arrested, detained, interrogated, or punished except in accordance with the law. This is the freedom of the person. Any disposition of arrest or detention made without legal basis, or any disposition made without following the procedures prescribed by law even if there is a law, is an illegal disposition. The public officials who make such illegal dispositions shall be liable under the Disciplinary Law, the Criminal Law, and the Civil Law. The residences of the people shall not be entered, searched, or sealed except in accordance with the law. This is the freedom of residence. For example, if a prosecutor or judicial police officer searches the residence of a person or seals their residence, they shall do so in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law and other relevant laws and regulations. Any violation of this is an infringement on the freedom of the people, and they shall also be liable under the Disciplinary, Criminal, and Civil Laws. The movement of the people shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law. This is the freedom of movement. People should be allowed to move freely as necessary for their livelihood in order to achieve a satisfactory life. Restrictions may be imposed in accordance with the law only when necessary. For example, prohibiting the movement of people with infectious diseases in accordance with laws and regulations to prevent the spread of infection is one example. People's freedom of religious belief shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law. This is the freedom of religion. Freedom of religion originally includes both freedom of belief and freedom of religious practice. Pure belief is a psychological activity that cannot be externally enforced. One cannot be forced to believe or not to believe. As for religious practices, such as attending religious services and spreading religious doctrines, they are also free in principle. However, if these practices are used as a pretext to disrupt society or offend public morals, the state may naturally intervene. To say that religious belief has absolute freedom and is absolutely unrestricted by law is a misunderstanding. Therefore, the wording of the draft constitution differs slightly from the Provisional Constitution. The freedom of speech, writing, and publication of the people shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law. This is the freedom of speech, writing, and publication. Speech refers to speeches, talks, debates, etc. Writing refers to the production of documents, paintings, etc. Publication refers to the printing and distribution of documents, paintings, etc. These three are all methods by which human beings express their thoughts. Thought is an essential element for promoting civilization and social development, and the freedom of thought of each person should be recognized. However, speech, writing, and publication may be restricted if they endanger public order or harm the state. Therefore, the Criminal Law, the Emergency Penalties Law for Endangering the Republic of China, and the Publication Law contain explicit restrictions. The private communications of the people shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law. This is the freedom of private communication. Communication refers to expressing intentions by means of telegrams, telephones, letters, etc. Private refers to a situation where it is more advantageous not to be known to others or not to be known to the majority. If people express their intentions through communication and wish to keep them private, the state has no reason to interfere. However, in order to protect the interests of the state and society, restrictions may sometimes be imposed in accordance with the law. For example, inspecting mail and telecommunications in accordance with martial law, inspecting letters of criminals in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law, and inspecting letters of bankrupts in accordance with the Bankruptcy Law are all legal. The assembly and association of the people shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law. This is the freedom of assembly and association. Assembly refers to a temporary gathering of many people, and association refers to a permanent group of many people. The thoughts of many people are exchanged, compromised, and expressed through assembly, which is indeed of great importance to communal life. Since the freedom of individuals to express their thoughts through speech has already been permitted, then assembly and association, which are merely ways to gather and express the thoughts of the people, must also be permitted. Assemblies and associations may have political purposes or non-political purposes. The laws of various countries often impose stricter restrictions on assemblies and associations with political purposes. In China, during the period of political tutelage, assemblies and associations must first obtain permission from the local party headquarters, must comply with the provisions of the Organizational Regulations for People's Organizations, and must not violate the provisions of the Criminal Law and the Emergency Penalties Law for Endangering the Republic of China. As for the police, they may supervise them for the purpose of maintaining public order, which goes without saying. The property of the people shall not be examined or confiscated except in accordance with the law. This is the freedom of property. Property is the material basis for the livelihood of the people. No illegal interference shall be made in any aspect of property rights. Even sealing or confiscation must have a legal basis. For example, requisitioning the land of the people in accordance with the Land Requisition Law and confiscating the property of the people in accordance with the Criminal Law are legal dispositions. In addition, there is freedom to choose employment and freedom to enter into contracts, which shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law. The above is an analysis and explanation of the right to freedom.</p>
<p>3.  The Right to Benefit. The right to benefit is the right of the people to enjoy special benefits from the state. Its purpose is to enjoy benefits, and it can require the state to take certain actions. It is active, not passive, and therefore different from the right to freedom. The right to freedom is passive, merely requiring the state not to interfere. If there are only passive rights without the active right to request the state to take certain actions, then the so-called right to freedom may be difficult to protect in practice. Therefore, the constitutions of various countries contain provisions regarding the right to benefit.</p>
<p>The scope of the right to benefit varies from country to country. Generally speaking, it can be divided into four types. One is the right to benefit in judicial matters, such as the right to civil and criminal litigation. Litigation can be brought to the judicial authorities in accordance with the provisions of the procedural law. The judicial authorities must then adjudicate the case. Another is the right to benefit in administrative matters, such as the right to bring administrative lawsuits, file petitions, or make requests. If the disposition of a public official is illegal and harms the rights of the people, the people may file a petition. If they are still not satisfied after the petition, they may bring an administrative lawsuit. As for the facilities of the state's political affairs, the people may also state their wishes to the state, which is called a request. Another is the right to benefit in education. Educational opportunities are equal for all people. Children of school age have the right to demand free education, and out-of-school people have the right to demand supplementary education. Private schools may request encouragement and subsidies, and school teachers and staff may request encouragement and protection. These are all benefits that can be enjoyed in education. Another is the right to benefit in economic matters. For example, poor people have the right to receive relief, and working people have the right to receive special protection. Special industries have the right to receive encouragement and protection. These are all rights that the people can be protected by the state in terms of livelihood.</p>
<p>4.  The Right to Participate in Politics. The right to participate in politics is the right of the people to participate in the political affairs of the state, which is different from other rights that are exercised solely for individual benefit. On the one hand, it is called the right to participate in politics, and on the other hand, it can also be called the obligation to participate in politics. The types of political participation rights stipulated in the constitutions of most countries are limited to the right to vote and the right to hold public office. According to the Founding Program of the National Government of China, the people have four political participation rights in addition to the right to take examinations: the right to elect, the right to recall, the right to initiate legislation, and the right to referendum. These four political rights can only be fully exercised by citizens after the promulgation of the constitution. The right to elect occupies a major position in the political participation rights of the people. People can elect the members of the people's representative bodies. They can elect the administrative personnel. Even the highest administrative head must be elected by the people. Because there is the right to elect, the spirit of democratic politics can be realized. The right to recall is the right of the people to directly remove members of state organs or officials, which complements the right to elect. If the elected members or officials are deemed to have violated the law or neglected their duties, they can be recalled in accordance with legal procedures. Because the people have this right, government personnel cannot neglect their duties and must faithfully represent the will of the people in order to seek the interests of the people. The right to initiate legislation is the right of the people to initiate a certain law or to change or abolish a certain law in accordance with public opinion. If the people believe that a certain matter cannot be handled without a certain good law, they must initiate legislation in accordance with public opinion. If the people believe that a certain law is harmful to the interests of the people, they must change or abolish the law in accordance with public opinion. This right to create and abolish laws is called the right to initiate legislation. The right to referendum is the right of the people to vote on the bills of the legislative body. If the people approve the bill, the law can be established. This is different from the right to initiate legislation. It does not create laws, but approves laws. The scope of which bills of the legislative body do not require a referendum and which must be submitted to a referendum by the people is determined by law. The political affairs of governing a country cannot only have the governance of people without the governance of law. The above-mentioned rights to elect and recall are methods for seeking the "governance of people." The rights to initiate legislation and referendum are methods for seeking the "governance of law." For a detailed explanation of good laws and beautiful intentions, please refer to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lectures on political power.</p>
<p>The right to take examinations is the right of the people to take examinations. The state implements examinations in order to select talent and enable them to engage in public service. All people who have certain qualifications can take the examinations. The right to take examinations is also the right to voluntarily serve as a member of the government. Although it is the same as the four political rights mentioned earlier as a right to participate in politics, it is actually different. The four political rights mentioned earlier are the rights to manage the government. The right to take examinations is only the right to voluntarily obtain the qualifications of an official to be a member of the government.</p>
<p>The rights of the people that are explicitly stipulated in the constitution are roughly as described above. The following will discuss the obligations that the people should fulfill.</p>
<p>(5) The Obligations That People Should Legally Fulfill</p>
<p>The people are the constituent elements of the state. In order to achieve the purpose of the state, it is natural that they cannot simply enjoy rights without assuming obligations. The scope of the people's obligations to the state varies with the times. In the past era of individual liberalism, the constitution emphasized the protection of individual rights, so the scope of the people's obligations was relatively narrow. Later, legal concepts changed, and the protection of social interests became the main focus. As a result, the constitutions of various countries also expanded the scope of the people's obligations. The Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China and the draft constitution of the Republic of China also have provisions on the obligations of the people, which can be divided into the following categories for discussion:</p>
<p>1.  The obligation to pay taxes. It is natural that the state collects taxes from the people to pay for the expenses of governance. The obligation to pay taxes is a kind of responsibility for the people to bear the expenses of the state. Those with more resources pay more taxes, and those with fewer resources pay fewer taxes, which is still in line with the principle of equality. The people only have the obligation to pay taxes within the scope stipulated by law. Taxes and levies not stipulated by law are miscellaneous taxes and oppressive taxes, and cannot be called legal.</p>
<p>2.  The obligation to perform military service. That is, the obligation to engage in military service to defend the state. The rise and fall of the state is the responsibility of every citizen. In order to maintain the survival of the state, the people must each assume military service. It also means that all citizens are soldiers. However, this refers to countries that adopt a conscription system. If a voluntary military service system is adopted, where soldiers are recruited, the so-called obligation of citizens to serve in the military may not be realized.</p>
<p>3.  The obligation to perform public service. Public service includes official duties, labor services, etc. Although it is a right for civil servants to perform official duties, it can also be called an obligation. If lawfully appointed, one should be selfless and not forcibly shirk responsibility. When labor services are assigned according to law, such as building roads and dredging rivers, the people also have an obligation to obey. The so-called there is only social freedom, no individual freedom, is what this means.</p>
<p>4.  The obligation to obey the actions of government agencies. When state government agencies legally perform their duties, the people have an obligation to obey. This is because government agencies are organs that exercise the power of governance. Obeying the lawful orders and dispositions of government agencies is obeying the power of governance, which is only natural.</p>
<p>The above discusses the obligations of the people stipulated in the constitution. The following will discuss:</p>
<p>(6) What is a state ruled by law?</p>
<p>For thousands of years, China has practiced autocratic monarchical politics. The will of the monarch was equivalent to the law, and the monarch could change the law. Whether there was a law or whether the law was appropriate was not considered important. This was a method of relying on people rather than on law, and emphasizing the governance of people rather than the governance of law. Most officials also acted expediently and arbitrarily. The obligations of the people were not subject to definite limitations, and the rights of the people were not subject to definite guarantees. When there were virtuous monarchs and good officials, they were not without a heart for the people and did things that benefited the people. However, virtuous monarchs and good officials were rare. Because the monarch and officials were not often good, and there was no definite law to restrain them in their actions and orders, they could give or take life and property at will. There was only the authority of the monarch and officials, and no benefit to the people. It was using the world to serve one person, without regard to the original purpose of the state. It cannot even be called the governance of people. The rule of law is even less of a consideration. The so-called rule of law is using law to govern the country, using law as a tool for governing the state. Not only must the organization and powers of state organs be stipulated by law, but all matters concerning the exercise of the power of governance must be in accordance with the law. The rights and obligations of the people to the state are clearly stipulated in law, and there are also definite laws and regulations to resolve the relations of rights and obligations between people. This is a method of relying on law and not emphasizing the governance of people. If the officials governing the country are competent, it would be good for everyone. Then, using good people to use good laws would be the best phenomenon in politics. In case of incompetence, the officials may not all be good, but with laws as a standard for their actions, they would not be allowed to abuse their power and do whatever they want, so politics would not necessarily be badly affected. If the rule of law is emphasized, the obligations of the people are limited to a certain extent, and the burdens are fair. The rights of the people are guaranteed by law, so that there will be no abuses such as class oppression. From the perspective of the state, only by respecting the law can it be open and honest, gain the sympathy of the people, and promote its policies. The old saying that there is only the governance of people without the governance of law is flawed. Which modern country that can stand on the world stage with honor does not emphasize the rule of law? The rule of law is superior to the governance of people. This can be believed. The following will discuss the last point:</p>
<p>(7) What kind of people should a modern state have?</p>
<p>Modern states all emphasize the rule of law. It can be said that those who do not emphasize the rule of law are not worthy of being called modern states. Generally speaking, the strength and weakness of a country and the excellence or inferiority of its politics are related to the strength and weakness and excellence or inferiority of its people. A strong and excellent people will not constitute a strong and excellent state, and will not produce good politics. Foreign countries and China both have governments and officials. Why can they respect the law and create a state ruled by law, while we cannot? Is it that our government and officials should be responsible, and our people have no responsibility? I think not. I think our people should also bear a great responsibility. We know that the people of a state ruled by law should have the cultivation of legal knowledge. The most important of these can be mentioned in two points. The first point is to know why people have rights. If a person has no responsibility in society and no mutual obligations in the crowd, then he has no legal status. The reason why a person is a person is entirely because he is a member of society, contributes to society, and exerts his efforts to share the goals and life of society with other people. His personal status comes from society's recognition of him as a member. His rights can only exist because of the recognition of society. In other words, the reason why the law protects the life, property, and interests of individuals is because they are related to society. Protecting the interests of individuals is protecting the interests of society. If an individual is completely unrelated to social life, such a person has no legal significance. Understanding this point, then every person, every citizen, should first fulfill his obligations, not forget his relationship to society and the state, and all want to serve society and the state. If everyone has this thought and this spirit, is there still a country that is not united and not progressive? The second point is to know what constitutes a violation of the law. The distinction between violating the law and not violating the law is indeed a difficult matter, but in general, there should be a general understanding. When there is an obligation that should be fulfilled, one knows that it should be fulfilled by law, and will not delay or make excuses. When there is a right that should be enjoyed, one knows that it should be enjoyed by law, and will not give up or willingly suffer bullying. When there are orders from government agencies and dispositions from officials, one knows that they are legal and will naturally obey and comply. One knows that they are illegal and will have legitimate claims. When one is handling public affairs, one knows to adhere to the principle of handling them according to law and will not have illegal behavior. If everyone has this ability to distinguish and this ability, are there still people who are not sound and law-abiding? Are there still public officials who are unscrupulous and corrupt? From this, it can be seen that the foundation of a state ruled by law lies in the legal knowledge of the people. It goes without saying that citizens should have legal knowledge. China is to keep pace with modern states on the track of the rule of law. If our people are willing to pay more attention to legal knowledge, then there will be faster progress, and the future of the rule of law is very promising. (End)</p>

<p>Kong's Explanation of the Committee's Mission</p>
<p>Minister Kong, in his capacity as President of the Central Bank, delivered a speech, stating, "Today is the first meeting of this committee. The mission of this committee has a significant relationship with China's financial and economic history. Regarding the reform measures, the detailed announcement has already been made public, and you all are aware of it, so there is no need to elaborate. However, everything must have a good foundation to gradually develop and flourish. How to consolidate the credit of legal tender, stabilize foreign exchange, revitalize industry and commerce, and revive the economy in the future all depend on the efforts of this committee. The government's organization of this committee is for this reason. You are all domestic financial leaders, so you have been specially appointed as members of this committee, bearing this mission. I hope everyone will do their best and work together to achieve this grand plan for the benefit of the country and the people."</p>
<p>Ministry's Regulations on Currency Exchange Procedures in Various Regions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Central Bank (Shanghai Money Character No. 61), and also instructed various bank associations, money industry associations, chambers of commerce, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, all tax revenue agencies under the Ministry's direct control, financial commissioners in various provinces, and financial departments, stating, "The Ministry announced today that, starting from November 4th, the banknotes issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications would be designated as legal tender. All payments and receipts for taxes and all public and private funds shall be limited to legal tender, and cash shall not be used. Violators will have their funds confiscated. It is also stipulated that those holding silver coins, raw silver, and other silver types shall exchange them for legal tender." These announcements and instructions have been issued separately. However, considering that China has a vast territory and transportation is often inconvenient, the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, and other bank notes, may not be circulating in all regions. In order to facilitate the people of various regions and to effectively implement the announcement regulations, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and various banks are hereby instructed to quickly transport legal tender to various regions so that there is sufficient supply. In areas where it is temporarily impossible to exchange for legal tender, the existing customs of the market may be temporarily maintained. The various associations and tax revenue agencies shall temporarily collect and exchange silver coins, raw silver, and other silver types, and transport the collected silver coins, raw silver, and other silver types to areas with legal tender for exchange, so as to avoid inconvenience to the people's daily use. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the various banks, associations, and chambers of commerce must further carefully plan convenient ways for the people and effectively implement laws and regulations based on the actual situation of the local area, and consult with the local government at any time to handle the matter. National laws are originally intended to benefit the people, and the Ministry will take into consideration any slight difficulties and address them accordingly. It is hoped that everyone will adhere to this principle, earnestly handle the matter, and report back." This is addressed to (Instruction). Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance also separately instructed the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to order local silver and money industry associations to investigate the inventory and cash reserves of various banks as of the 3rd and report them to the Ministry of Finance. The three banks have already separately instructed their respective branches in various regions to handle the matter.</p>
<p>State-Run Institutions to Exchange Coins</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Communications, and also sent letters to the Central Bank, various silver and money industry associations, chambers of commerce, and various banks, stating, "Currency is originally the standard for transactions. In ancient times, goods were exchanged for goods. Later, there were springs and cloths. With the increase in imports and exports and the growth of transactions, gold, silver, and copper were cast into coins. With the development of industry and commerce and the evolution of society, the number of credit currencies exceeded that of metal currencies. In modern civilized countries, there is no country that does not use banknotes instead of coins as the standard for transactions. The Ministry's decision to designate the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications as legal tender is based on this principle. Considering that China has been using silver for a long time, and the population is large, savings are mostly in silver. At a time when new laws are being promulgated, remote areas may feel slightly inconvenienced, and the banknotes of the three banks may not have been widely circulated, or there may be cases where people holding silver coins and silver types have nowhere to exchange them for legal tender. The three banks, various banks, various money shops, various associations, various tax revenue agencies, and state-run enterprises, such as postal services, telegraph services, railways, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and various bureaus, are hereby instructed to uniformly exchange them on behalf of the people, in order to facilitate the general public and provide a clear explanation, so as to dispel doubts and facilitate implementation. It is hoped that you will investigate and instruct your subordinates to comply." This is addressed to (You are to comply with this order immediately).</p>
<p>Instructing the Three Banks to Stabilize Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, stating, "On the 4th of this month, the Ministry announced six regulations, which have been communicated (ordered) to you. The three banks should be responsible for stabilizing foreign exchange rates. It is hoped that you will promptly observe the market situation and coordinate with the circumstances, so as not to allow any changes outside the norm. This is what is hoped for (this is of utmost importance)." This is addressed to (This order).</p>
<p>Municipal Government's Proclamation for Uniform Compliance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government issued a proclamation yesterday, stating, "For the purpose of proclamation, it is found that the monetary policy announced by the Ministry of Finance on November 4th of this year is to seek the permanent stability of currency and finance, in order to achieve the goal of economic revival. All measures have been announced in detail by the Ministry of Finance. All our citizens should understand this principle and comply uniformly. Anyone who deliberately obstructs, spreads rumors, or attempts to speculate and raise prices will be severely arrested and dealt with without leniency. This proclamation."</p>

<p>The meeting process continued as the time was already late, it was decided on the spot to hold another temporary executive committee meeting at 12:00 noon yesterday. Committee members Chen Guangfu and others all proposed three resolutions (see the notice). It did not disperse until afternoon.</p>
<p>Three Resolutions on Business Measures</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Banking Association issued a notice to various banks, stating, "Dear Sirs, today (the 4th) at noon, this association convened a temporary executive committee meeting to discuss banking business issues after the government stipulated the legal police. Two measures were resolved as follows: (1) From today onwards, the receipt and payment of funds will be limited to legal tender as stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, and cash shall not be used. All colleagues must transfer the silver dollars to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to exchange for legal tender for circulation. (1) If colleagues have more remittances than transfers, silver dollars can be temporarily remitted, and the details will be settled with the Central Bank and Bank of Communications. The detailed procedures will be discussed jointly by the reserve of this association, the reserve of the money industry, and the Central Bank and Bank of Communications. (3) In the future, all kinds of bills issued by colleagues (such as fixed deposit certificates, promissory notes, etc.) should be uniformly marked with the words 'national currency' to show uniformity. The above resolutions are hereby notified separately, and it is hoped that you will take note and handle them accordingly."</p>
<p>Money Industry Meeting Resolves to Comply</p>
<p>The Money Industry Association held a meeting of managers of various shops at 9:00 PM on the 3rd to discuss important matters. Managers from 54 shops, including Cun Jia, Yuan Sheng, Wufeng, Yi Da, Zhentai, Shen Yuan, Ruichang, Henglong, Chun Yuan, Hongxiang, Zhixiang, Shunkang, Tongrun, Tongyu, Xinfu, Baofeng, Qingda, Qingcheng, and Fuyuan, attended. Sixty people including Zhang Wenbo, Chen Yutang, Zhang Mengzhou, Hu Chun. Jin Shaojun, Qian Yuansheng, Chen Zuben, Yao Yongchang, Lin Yousan, Qin Zhenfu, Yu Zuoting, Xi Jiming, Zhao Songyuan, Tian Ziqing, Zheng Quan, and Shen Jingliang were present. Chaired by He Zhongxiao, Qin Runqing first reported that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi convened a meeting to work hard to save themselves, revive the economy, and seek permanent stability of currency and finance, and stipulated six measures for compliance. On the spot, it was unanimously resolved to notify all member money shops to comply, and the meeting adjourned at around 10:00 PM. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance's announcement was copied and distributed to various shops and announced in the market.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Cooperate with Us</p>
<p>This time, the government, in order to stabilize the market and revive the economy, decided to avoid inflation by exploring central reserves, so that silver would not flow out, in order to consolidate the monetary system and improve finance. Since yesterday's implementation, the impression has been very good. The gold standard and the foreign exchange market have also been very stable. Now, foreign banks in this port, such as HSBC, have been ordered by the British government to work hard with our country and instruct HSBC banks and other British banks and nationals in various places to send all their inventory and holdings of silver coins to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to exchange banknotes for circulation. Regarding debt, they are also ordered to comply with our government's orders and not to pay in cash, otherwise they will be punished separately. It is heard that other foreign banks also exchanged banknotes for cash with the three banks yesterday, and the number was quite large. This policy of bank employees will undoubtedly benefit our national economy.</p>
<p>Announcement by British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen</p>
<p>British Ambassador to China, Knatchbull-Hugessen, issued an announcement yesterday to prohibit the payment of silver. The translation is as follows. The original text reads, "For the purpose of notification, the following regulations are hereby formulated by this Ambassador. It is necessary to copy and issue them to your people for uniform compliance. Do not violate them. This announcement is made by British Ambassador to China, Knatchbull-Hugessen, November 4, 1935. The Prohibition of Payment of Silver Regulations of 1935, No. 2, are hereby promulgated in accordance with the granting of powers under Article 209 of the "Six An Act Concerning China" of 1925. Whereas the National Government of the Republic of China has ordered the nationwide prohibition of the use of cash silver, and the use of cash silver is an illegal act. Furthermore, in accordance with the Extraterritoriality Acts of 1890 and 1913, and the Act Concerning China of 1925, this Ambassador may formulate various regulations to manage the people of this country so that they can live and work in peace. Now, in order to promote the implementation of the aforementioned order issued by the Chinese government, the following regulations are hereby formulated. All legal persons, firms, and companies under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of this country shall comply without violation. (1) In these regulations, the term "legal person" refers to people, firms, and companies of British nationality residing in China, doing business in China, or within the scope of the aforementioned Act Concerning China of 1925. (2) Anyone who, alone or jointly with other British or non-British people, repays all or part of a debt with cash silver shall be deemed to have violated the law and shall be subject to imprisonment for up to three months, or with hard labor, or a fine of up to fifty pounds, or both imprisonment and a fine. (3) These regulations shall be named the Prohibition of Payment of Cash Silver Regulations of 1935. According to this decree, silver clauses in British bonds, leases, or other financial instruments are all illegal. In short, the central government has ordered the recovery of circulating silver and made it state-owned, and made the Chinese government's paper currency the legal tender for public and private obligations. Therefore, British commercial banks can have the right not to pay any silver. The effect of this move is indeed not insignificant."</p>
<p>Market Announcement of Subsidiary Coinage Prices</p>
<p>The Ningbo Road Money Market, in addition to announcing the Ministry of Finance's announcement yesterday morning, also issued an announcement on the fixed prices for subsidiary coinage. The announcement stated, "For the purpose of notification, by face-to-face instruction from the Minister of Finance, starting from October 4th, the price of subsidiary coinage shall be limited to twelve cents per standard coin, and no increase or decrease is allowed. This is specially notified to you for compliance." Therefore, the transaction of the market is different from the past, and in the future, it will be in accordance with this price, without increase or decrease.</p>
<p>Soaring Exchange Rates for Subsidiary Coins and Copper Coins</p>
<p>The money market announced yesterday that the price of Jiangnan and Guangdong subsidiary coins was 10,000 cents per 833.33 yuan, and 300,000 copper coins per 100 yuan. However, the exchange rate of 100 yuan for copper coins in the Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Public Concession, and French Concession exchange shops was not uniform. The maximum was 12 cents per yuan, and the minimum was 10 cents, 240 wen, and 200 wen. The maximum for copper coins per yuan was 3,000 wen, and the minimum was 2,800 wen.</p>
<p>Three Banks Busy Exchanging Banknotes</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance officially announced that cash silver was state-owned, and that the banknotes issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications were legal tender, and that cash silver was not allowed to be used in the market to prevent outflow, various industries such as the silver and money industry, and merchants, all held silver coins to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to exchange for banknotes. They came and went in large numbers, and the staff of the three banks were very busy. It is expected that the number of people who will request to exchange for legal tender in the future will be even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Stabilization Tax Rate Higher Than Before</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee announced the equalization tax rate at 10:00 AM yesterday through the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications committee members Xi Demao, Bei Songsun, and Zhang Peishen at the Central Bank's Business Bureau meeting, which was 57.25%, which was 50.5% more than the equalization tax rate of 6.75% announced the day before.</p>

<p>Silversmiths' Association Resolves to Seek Remedy</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance stipulates that all silver and money shops, firms, and other public and private institutions or individuals holding silver standard coins or common silver coins, raw silver, and other such items, should be handed over to the Currency Reserve Management Committee or its designated bank to exchange for legal tender starting from November 4th. The Shanghai Silversmiths' Association held an emergency general meeting of members at 8:30 AM yesterday. The attendees included Qing Fuxing, Lao Fengxiang, Qiu Tianbao, Qingyun, Yang Qinghe, and others. The meeting was chaired by Fu Shengmao, who reported the contents of the Ministry of Finance's announcement. The meeting then began to discuss the matter. It was decided on the spot to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Ministry of Finance to request remedies. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM, and the document group was instructed to draft the letter.</p>

On the morning of the 4th, he also returned to Shanghai on the same ship and took the early express train to Beijing to visit his father. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>

Before leaving Japan, he met with the Japanese authorities to bid farewell. He also talked about the Sino-Japanese issue during the meeting. The opinions of the two countries are now very close. Ambassador Jiang continued to talk about the news of President Wang's assassination attempt, which he learned about in Nagasaki. At that time, there were various rumors in Japan. He learned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegram that President Wang's injuries were not serious, and his heart was slightly relieved. As for the date of his return to office, it has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Went to Beijing Last Night</p>
<p>Ambassador Jiang and his party of five took the night express train to Beijing at 11:00 PM last night to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report. When Ambassador Jiang arrived in Shanghai, he was very concerned about President Wang's injuries, so he planned to visit him immediately after arriving in Beijing. As for President Wang's son, Meng Jin, who went abroad at the end of last month, originally planned to go to Germany via Japan to study. Unexpectedly, when he passed through Japan, he learned about President Wang's assassination attempt, so he hurriedly returned to China with Ambassador Jiang. After disembarking, he went straight to the North Railway Station to take the early express train to his hometown to visit his father.</p>

<h3 id="e58">National Labor Organization Our Country's Director Li Pingheng Returns Home Yesterday <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Lin Kanghou, Guo Shun, and others went to welcome him, and the Shanglian Association and other groups hosted a banquet that evening.</p>
<p>Li Pingheng, our country's director of the International Labor Bureau, left the country on January 15th of this spring to attend the 19th International Labor Conference in Geneva. After staying abroad for nearly ten months, he left Europe last month and returned home on the Italian postal company's Conte Rosso. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 4:45 p.m. yesterday, berthing at the China Merchants Northern Dock on East Broadway Road. Those who went to the dock to welcome him included Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce; Guo Shun, Chairman of the China Industrial Federation; Qian Chengxu, the Director-General; Cheng Haifeng, Director of the Chinese Branch of the International Labor Bureau; Zhu Xuefan, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai General Labor Union; Lu Jingshi, Chairman of the Chinese Labor Association; Yang Youren, representative of the National Labor Comrades Association; and Gu Bingyuan, a capitalist consultant who had recently returned from attending this International Labor Conference, totaling more than ten people. After landing, Mr. Li went to his lodgings to rest. At 7 p.m. that evening, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the China Industrial Federation, the General Labor Union, the National Labor Comrades Association, and other groups, including Lin Kanghou, Guo Shun, and Gan Haifeng, specially held a banquet at the Yiyou Society on Hankou Road to welcome Mr. Li. According to Mr. Li when he arrived in port yesterday, he told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency that he was unable to speak freely due to the hurried journey.

After completing his social engagements in Shanghai, Mr. Li will go to Beijing to meet with the Minister of Industry and other authorities to report everything.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Niu Huilin Returns to Shanghai and Talks <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>President Wang's injuries are very good. Noel goes to Beijing to diagnose internal disorders.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after President Wang was shot in Beijing, he was sent to the Central Hospital for treatment. Because the bullet lodged in the intercostal space has not yet been removed, a special telegram was sent to orthopedic surgery masters Niu Huilin and Miller, requesting both doctors to take a plane from Shanghai and Guangdong to Beijing on the 3rd to diagnose and treat Wang, so as to restore his health as soon as possible. After Niu and Miller arrived in Beijing and diagnosed Wang once, they took the night express train out of Beijing that evening and arrived in Shanghai at 7:15 a.m. yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Niu at his clinic. According to him, President Wang's injuries have been progressing well since Liu Ruiheng and Shen Kefei devoted their efforts day and night to treatment. The swelling on his face has gradually subsided, and he is in good spirits, but his appetite is slightly less. The bullet lodged in the intercostal space is currently not convenient to be removed surgically. According to my experience, the bullet remaining in the body is not dangerous, so it doesn't matter whether the bullet is removed or not. President Wang suffers from diabetes, and his old illness has been newly cured, and he has suffered this injury, so more attention should be paid to treatment and recuperation. Dr. Noel, who has been treating Wang's internal disorders, has already set off from Bao Cheng and is flying to Beijing, where he will arrive on the 4th to diagnose and treat Wang, so as to improve his appetite and restore his health as soon as possible. The Central Hospital does not receive visitors to President Wang, except for those with special permission, so that he can rest peacefully. The hospital has also assigned three nurses to take turns day and night to care for him by his bedside. Wang's relatives live on both sides of the ward, and a telephone has been installed to report his injuries to the outside world at any time. All the facilities are very complete, he said. Mr. Niu also plans to go to Beijing again in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e60">China Merchants Liangjiang Ship Aground in Liuhe Yesterday <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Jiangxin has been rescued and returned to Shanghai. Jianxian is currently being towed.</p>
<p>There was fog on the sea outside Wusongkou yesterday. The state-run China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River ships, Jian Guo and Jiang Xin, ran aground at the mouth of Liuhe one after the other. The Shanghai General Bureau only received a special telegram from the Navy Department at noon and immediately sent a ship to rescue them. In the evening, the Jiang Xin ship had already been towed out and returned to Shanghai, while the Jian Guo ship had not yet left the shoal and was still being rescued.</p>
<p>Jian Guo Encountered Fog and Ran Aground</p>
<p>The Jian Guo has a load capacity of 2,770 tons, registered as 1,588 tons. The ship is 278 feet and 2 inches long, 42 feet and 9 inches wide, and has a draft of 12 feet. It was built in 1905. On the 3rd of this month, it was fully loaded with goods and passengers in Shanghai and set off for the Yangtze River. It left Jinliyuan Wharf at 2:00 a.m. on the 4th. By the time it left Wusongkou, it was already after 5:00 a.m. At that time, the fog outside Songkou was very heavy, making navigation extremely difficult. Captain Huang Youshi has always been careful, so when sailing to Liuhe port, near a place called Spit Buoy, about nine nautical miles from Wusong, he went off course in the heavy fog, causing the ship to run aground on a sandy beach. The captain tried to reverse the ship to try to get out on its own, but because the draft was deep and the ship was heavily loaded, the bottom of the ship was stuck in the shallow sand and could not move, losing its sailing ability.</p>
<p>Jiang Xin's Rescue Also Runs Aground</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River ship Jiang Xin, which was returning to Shanghai from Hankou, passed by Liuhe yesterday and discovered that the Jian Guo was aground. After Jiang Xin inquired, Jian Guo asked Jiang Xin to come forward to help and tow it off the shoal. Jiang Xin stopped and sailed to where Jian Guo was aground, intending to use a wire cable to hold Jian Guo and try to tow it down. However, the draft there was very shallow, and Jiang Xin was also heavily loaded. Before it had sailed near Jian Guo, it itself ran aground. Although the situation was lighter than that of Jian Guo, it had also lost its ability to move, causing both Yangtze River ships to run aground.</p>
<p>Qingtian Warship Asks for Help</p>
<p>The Qingtian surveying ship of the Navy Department's Hydrographic Bureau sailed to the outside of Wusongkou after noon yesterday. Seeing that the Jiang Guo of Jian Guo was aground in Liuhekou, it sailed closer to inquire. The captains of the two ships asked it to send an urgent telegram to the Shanghai General Bureau on their behalf, requesting that a ship be sent to tow them. The Qingtian warship did so. This telegram was sent to the Navy Headquarters, and at 12:00 noon, the Navy Headquarters forwarded it to the China Merchants Bureau, instructing it to quickly go to the rescue. After receiving the report, the bureau immediately sent a ship to tow them.</p>
<p>Baohe's Rescue Fails</p>
<p>The British-owned Jardine Matheson's Baohe ship was returning to Shanghai from Yichang and Hankou yesterday. After passing the outside of Wusongkou, it discovered that Jiang Xin and others were aground and unable to move. When the Baohe ship approached, Jiang Xin asked it to help tow it. The Baohe ship had the intention of helping with navigation, so it went forward to tow it. However, the tide was ebbing at that time, and the water was very shallow. The Baohe ship failed to tow the Jiang Xin ship, so it sailed to Shanghai. Another ship sent by the China Merchants Bureau went to tow.</p>
<p>Jiang Xin Leaves Shoal and Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the bureau received the telegram from the Navy Headquarters, it contacted Kang Zhengji about a tugboat and rushed to rescue the two Yangtze River ships. Kang Zhengji dispatched the Beiyang tugboat with the largest horsepower, which rushed from Shanghai to Wusong at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. After arriving at the mouth of Liuhe, it first towed Jiang Xin. The Beiyang had great towing power and a shallow draft. When it went to tow Jiang Xin, it was also high tide, so Jiang Xin was towed out of the shoal. Because Jiang Xin's hull was not damaged, it sailed back to Shanghai on its own. It had already returned to Shanghai at around 5:00 p.m. and arrived at Jinliyuan Wharf to unload passengers and goods.</p>
<p>Jian Guo is Being Towed</p>
<p>The Beiyang tugboat is currently towing the Jian Guo ship. Because the place where Jian Guo ran aground is shallower than the Jiang Xin ship, the towing work is relatively more laborious. According to the bureau's spokesman, it is generally expected to be rescued. At the latest, it will be able to be towed away from the shoal this morning. If the Jian Guo's hull is not badly damaged, it will still be ordered to go upstream to Hankou and not return to Shanghai to avoid delaying the schedule.</p>

<p>Li Tingan, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, departed for Europe on the Japanese Empress of Changxing Company at 1:30 p.m. yesterday at the invitation of the League of Nations and the appointment of the Municipal Government to study health administration in various European countries. Representatives from various agencies and organizations in the city went to see him off, and the number was very enthusiastic, including Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau; Shen Yi, Director of the Public Works Bureau; Section Chief Zhang Binghui, representative of the Social Bureau; Yuan Liangzou, representative of the Public Security Bureau; Wu Liguo, Acting Director of the Health Bureau; Shen Gao, Chief of the First Section; You Jihua, Director of the Shanghai South Health Office; and students from the training class of the People's Welfare Undertakings Management Committee, totaling more than 100 representatives from various agencies and organizations. According to Mr. Li on the ship, this trip abroad for study is half invited by the League of Nations and half appointed by the Municipal Government, and he has received various assistance and introductions from the Health Department, making future study much more convenient. During the journey, it is planned to first pass through Japan, staying in Kobe and Tokyo for one or two days to study on the way, then pass through Canada, also staying for one or two days, then go to the United States, staying for five days, and then go to Europe to study. The study period is about two months. He will conduct a detailed study of the health administrative undertakings of various countries, and will pay special attention to the health administration of emerging European countries such as Poland. Compared with various undertakings in European countries, our country is far behind, especially in health undertakings. This trip abroad for study will focus on urban health administration, so as to use it as a reference for reforming my country's health undertakings after returning home. The study period will be more than four months, and he will definitely be able to return to Shanghai by mid-March next year. During his absence, all bureau affairs will be handled by Wu Liguo, Chief of the Third Section, on his behalf.</p>

<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, a person in charge of the Cotton Control Committee of the National Economic Council told reporters yesterday that in order to solve the question of which varieties are most suitable for various cotton areas, the Central Cotton Improvement Institute and the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry have collected Asian cotton and American cotton varieties, formulated plans, and cooperated with agricultural farms and cotton farms in various provinces to carry out large-scale regional trials. A total of 21 trial sites are distributed in the provinces of the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins. There are 32 varieties of Asian cotton and 35 varieties of American cotton. Now is the cotton harvesting season, and the trial results of each variety are easiest to observe. The association specially sent Feng Zefang, Deputy Director of the Central Cotton Improvement Institute and Director of the Cotton Planting Department, to inspect the cotton trial results in various fields in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins at the end of last month. It is expected that it will take about one and a half months to complete the work in the ten provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hubei.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Ministry of Finance Approves: Red Account Statements Do Not Need Stamps <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce notified all members yesterday: Previously, the association stated that stores issue various items of deposits and debts at the end of each year for shareholders to review, called red account statements. This is completely different from the account statements in Article 3 of the Stamp Tax Law Tax Rate Table. According to the law, it seems that there is no need to affix stamps. The Ministry of Finance was requested to verify and instruct. Now, on the 2nd of this month, the Ministry of Finance's Tax Character No. 7680 instructed that: Qing Dai Dian rest assured that the red account statements issued by stores after the end of each year to send various items of deposits and debts to shareholders for review are different in nature from the account statements given to customers as proof of payment. Naturally, there is no need to affix stamps. We should be informed, so we recorded the approval and notified, and we hope that we will check and inform, and send separate letters to the same industry to let them know.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Silk Factory Industry Association Discusses Zhejiang Province's Unified Cocoon Collection <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Lianna Foreign Firm Refuses to Pay Silk Money. It is decided to send separate letters to the Wuxi and Zhejiang Associations to form a raw silk exchange.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association held a re-election of the committee on the 27th of last month. Party and government agencies sent people to "supervise the election on the spot. After performing the ceremony as usual, Shen Huachen, Chairman of the Association, first reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Zhu Yangwu, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Hu Yuqi, representative of the Social Bureau, and Yuan Hongjun, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, who gave instructions and speeches, and then began the election. Chen Zezhong, Wu Shengshan, Zhang Chucai, Xu Zuchun, Xu Peichui, Cao Jinke, Huang Jiwen, and other eight people were elected. Shen Huachen, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Jing'an, Zhang Peishen, Zhang Yunsheng, Sun Rongchang, Tang Yeqin and other seven people remained in office. The newly elected committee members" were immediately sworn in and took office. The association held its first meeting yesterday and re-elected five standing committee members. Shen Zangchen, Zhu Jing'an, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Yunsheng, and Zhang Peishen were elected. Shen Huachen was elected as the chairman of the committee. Then the association affairs were discussed. (1) A proposal to raise funds for flood relief was discussed and it was decided that staff would be sent to various factories today to contact them for donations. (2) A proposal that raw silk exporters and silk factories should register uniformly was discussed and it was decided that it would be discussed again after Chairman Shen attends the joint meeting next Thursday (i.e. the 7th). (3) A proposal to organize a raw silk exchange was discussed and it was decided to continue the previous proposal and send separate letters to the Wuxi and Zhejiang industry associations to schedule a meeting to proceed. (4) The Zhejiang Sericulture Control Association's restriction on cocoon collection was discussed. This case was discussed for a long time, and it was generally believed that government-run private enterprises compete with the people for profit, which is somewhat inappropriate. For example, during the autumn cocoon season, only five Shanghai silk factories were approved to collect cocoons. This time, during the late autumn cocoon season, Shanghai silk factories were restricted from going to purchase cocoons at all, which clearly violates the legal provisions that people have the freedom to buy and sell. Over the years, the losses have been quite large. This year's silk market has improved slightly, but it is being suppressed, resulting in a lack of raw materials, which will force factories to stop work one after another, which will greatly affect the livelihoods of workers. It was decided that after each factory submits a written report to the association on the registration of cocoon collection and the actual situation of the lack of raw materials, it will be discussed again. (5) The Lianna Foreign Firm's refusal to pay for silk was discussed. When this case was discussed, the atmosphere suddenly became tense, and it was considered that the situation was very serious. It was decided that Chairman Shen would be sent to Lianna Foreign Firm to demand payment first. If there is no satisfactory solution, all factories will be notified to stop trading with Lianna Foreign Firm. It was decided to stop all shipments to them. The meeting adjourned at 8 o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e69">China Foreign Famine Relief Committee Reports Drought in Shangying, Anhui <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief Committee on Renji Road has received so many telegrams requesting relief due to the recent river floods that they are like snowflakes. The need for rescue is more urgent than fire, and they are already overwhelmed. Not only have several counties in Anhui Province suffered from accumulated floods, but also from severe droughts. According to Mr. Ma Zhuqing, representing the French in Yingshang, he personally came to the association to report the drought and brought letters from various French groups requesting relief. They are recorded as follows: "Enlightened ones, unfortunately, our Yingshang has suffered repeated calamities. The suffering from the disaster is especially the most severe in this severe drought. It is estimated that the entire territory of hundreds of miles is a barren land, showing cracks. No grain can be obtained, and ten rooms are empty. There is no way to call for help, and the chance of survival is forever cut off. It is truly a rare famine in a hundred years. Since the flood of the 20th year, followed by banditry, the situation in the rural areas is about to collapse. We were hoping that the three seasons would not be harmful and that we would have funds to make up for it. However, since the beginning of summer this year, there have only been three slight rains, and the wet land is less than an inch. A cup of water is like firewood, how can it help? The disaster is like burning, and there is no green grass in the fields. At this time of the three autumns, it is still not raining, and there is no hope of sowing wheat. People are becoming more and more panicked. Therefore, the strong escape to seek survival, while the old and weak remain to wait for death. Eating bran and chewing kernels is difficult to describe in pictures. Their faces are thin and their bodies are deformed, who can tell their suffering? Since the current situation is already like this, what can we imagine for the future? In addition to sending the disaster map, we are sending this letter to mournfully inform you and beg for your rescue."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association sent a letter to the national lawyers associations yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, the Seventh National Lawyers Association of the Republic of China Representatives Conference was originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai on September 23, 1935. Later, we received a notice from the Lawyers Association stating that the meeting date, rules, and facts were all obstructive, and we were asked to change the date. We immediately cancelled it and sent a letter. We believe that we will be able to check it in detail. Now we have received a letter from the Lawyers Association No. 361, which states that the Seventh Representatives Conference is now rescheduled to be held in Shanghai on February 16, 1936. Please check and prepare." After checking, the date of the conference has been determined by the association, and we should continue to prepare. We have borrowed the Chinese Xueyi Society on Jin Shenfu Road, Aimei Xian Road, French Concession of Shanghai as the venue, and agreed on a hotel that will give preferential treatment to the attending representatives. In addition to the Lawyers Association handling the preferential treatment for the attending representatives to take the bus, we have directly sent letters to the lawyers associations. We have also listed the date and address of the conference and the specially priced preferential hotels in the letter. We hope that you will check and recommend the representatives to come to Shanghai in advance to report to the meeting (No. 572, at the intersection of Belle Road and Lafayette Road, French Concession of Shanghai), so that they can attend the meeting at that time."</p>

<h3 id="e71">Devouring Puffer Fish Three People Died Tragically <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Those Who Heard It Could Not Help But Feel Sad</p>
<p>Zhou Agen, a native of Changshu, who lived at No. 1, Lane 5, Zhangjiabang Road, Pudong, was 56 years old. He used to run a distiller's shop, but after the shop closed, he worked on a ship. He is now unemployed. His wife, Ms. Feng, is 41 years old and from the same hometown as Zhou. His son, Rong Sheng, is 14 years old and is still studying. Zhou has a friend named Wu Zigen, nicknamed Little Wuxi, who works as a watchman at the nearby Changde Oil Factory. On the morning of the previous day, Wu bought two puffer fish in Puxi for 1,200 yuan and took them to Zhou's house to cook and eat. At lunch, Zhou and Wu drank and devoured the fish, and Ms. Feng also ate a lot of fish. Only Zhou's son, Rong Sheng, refused to eat it. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 p.m., Wu suddenly felt severe abdominal pain and his expression changed drastically. After a while, he fell to the ground and died. Zhou then felt pain and knew that he had been poisoned by the fish. He immediately hired a car to rush to Pudong Hospital for treatment. After arriving at the hospital, his poisoning had worsened and he became unconscious. The hospital doctor determined that it was too late to save him and ordered the driver to pull him back. Before he could reach home, he died on the way. At this time, Zhou's wife, Ms. Feng, also felt severe abdominal pain. Seeing the danger of her husband and Wu, she rushed to a hospital across from the Great World on Edward Road for treatment. She died at 11:00 p.m. that night. After the tragedy occurred, Director Yang of the Yangjiadu Police Station ordered Internal Affairs Police Chief Dai Guanqing to go to investigate. He ordered the local security guard, Yang Baobao, to report to the local court, which appointed Prosecutor Zhang to come to the scene to examine the bodies of Wu and Zhou and determine that they had died from poisoning. Because Wu's body had no family members, it was ordered to be collected by the Charity Hall. Zhou's body was ordered to be collected by his brother and sister-in-law with a coffin, and another coffin was prepared to go to Puxi Hospital to collect Ms. Feng's body and carry it back to Pudong so that she could be buried with her husband. The incident caused a sensation in the neighborhood, and the spectators could not help but feel sad.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Water Disaster Relief Association Holds Event: Boy Scouts Mobilize to Fundraise <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Boy Scout Fundraising for Chrysanthemum Appreciation and Relief Efforts Achieves Excellent Results Starting from the 9th</p>
<p>This year, mountain floods and widespread inundations have caused disasters, especially in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins, where the suffering is particularly severe. The Shanghai Disaster Relief Association for various provinces, recognizing the magnitude of the impending disaster, has been advocating for the victims. They have successively organized various entertainment events and appealed for donations from all parties for relief. All sectors of society consider this work important and are enthusiastically supporting it. Mr. Li Ruotao, the general manager of the Sun Sun Company, mindful of this situation, has arranged various famous chrysanthemums in one corner for a mixed competition. All proceeds from the ticket sales will be donated to relief efforts. Starting on the 2nd of this month, the event lasted for three consecutive days and concluded yesterday. The number of visitors each day was exceptionally high. According to the person in charge, the income from this event has been good, thanks to donations from various parties. As the event has already closed and all related work is being completed, it is hoped that all sectors will promptly submit their ticket payments to the temporary office of the fundraising team on the third floor of the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area for compilation and public announcement. Furthermore, the city's Boy Scouts have decided to launch a full-scale fundraising campaign, from the 9th to the 17th of this month. Details regarding the fundraising methods have already been published in various newspapers. According to reports, Boy Scout teams participating in this fundraising effort must report the number of participants to the council before this month to facilitate work allocation and area assignment. The council has also prepared a "Proclamation to Compatriots" and numerous slogans to inspire enthusiastic donations from the public. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) More than ten provinces, including Hubei, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangxi, have starving disaster victims eagerly awaiting our assistance. (2) Saving our compatriots in the disaster areas is saving ourselves. (3) Disaster relief is saving people; saving people is saving ourselves. (4) Disaster relief and caring for the people are the duties of every Chinese citizen. (5) A donation of one yuan saves a life. (6) Universal disaster relief relies entirely on the strength of the masses. (7) Disaster relief is a national rejuvenation movement. (8) Compatriots of the whole city, come quickly and contribute generously. (9) Donating to disaster relief is a great act. (10) Please, all sectors of society, work hard to donate to the general disaster relief effort. The Shanghai Disaster Relief Association for various provinces respectfully proclaims to all citizens: Our country has suffered frequent disasters for many years. This year, since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain, mountain floods, and successive disasters in the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Han rivers. Disaster areas encompass more than ten provinces, including Hubei, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangxi, with tens of millions of victims. The situation is worse than in the twentieth year of the Republic. The starving people are gaunt and emaciated, lying prostrate on the roadside. The tragedy is unprecedented. As autumn ends and winter approaches, considering the poor and destitute, wandering and displaced, suffering from hunger and cold, enduring death and waiting for rescue, feelings of compassion arise in everyone's heart. If we put ourselves in their place, how could we not be saddened? Shanghai is the wealthiest area in the country, but in recent years, the market has been sluggish, and all industries are depressed. Coupled with the decline of the rural economy in the interior, the once prosperous Shanghai is almost like a setting sun. However, even if society is poor, we should show the spirit of mutual assistance and self-help among Chinese people. Moreover, Shanghai society today has not been able to avoid extravagance and consumption. With a little frugality, there is still surplus capacity. We live comfortably by the sea, with clothing and food. If we do not pity and care for the compatriots in various places who are groaning in distress in the floodwaters and after the floods, needing clothing, food, and medicine, who else can we expect to pity and care for them? This year, the disaster area is vast, and there are many disaster victims. Without unified donations and the contribution of the masses, how can we overcome the difficulties? Therefore, this association is organizing a city-wide Boy Scout fundraising campaign for water disasters, divided into one-jiao, two-jiao, one-yuan, and small ocean two-jiao amounts. We hope that all compatriots and people from all walks of life in the city will generously donate, regardless of the amount. We only ask that everyone does their best, embracing the principle of "treating the drowning of others as our own," and "saving others is saving ourselves." We rely on this enthusiastic contribution for the future of the country, society, and nation.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Mother and Daughter Commit Suicide by Poison <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>No Means of Livelihood, Economic Hardship, Deeply Affected by Poison, Life Difficult to Save</p>
<p>A Chaozhou woman, Qian Chen, 38 years old, has a daughter named Yuying, 17 years old. Since her husband's death and due to rural bankruptcy in recent years, life has been difficult. She and her daughter came to Shanghai to make a living, residing at the home of her brother, Chen Xincheng, at No. 4, Lane 551, North Shansi Road. Recently, due to her daughter's inability to find work, coupled with her brother's business failure and economic hardship, conflicts arose between the sister-in-law and the mother and daughter, and they both conceived a desire to end their lives. The other day (the 3rd), at about 1 pm, Wang Yuying went alone to the Eastern Hotel on Tibet Road, intending to book a room. The receptionist led her to the sixth floor and booked Room 606. The tea boy, Hu Qian, took out a pencil and asked the woman to write down her name, age, and place of origin. Wang Yuying took the pen and wrote "Wang Yuying, 17 years old, Suzhou." The tea boy, noticing that Wang's accent was not Wu dialect, questioned her. Wang claimed to have lived in Shanghai for a long time. The tea boy then asked her to write "local." Seeing that Yuying's hands were trembling and she looked flustered, fearing something was amiss, he politely refused and told her to book a room elsewhere. Yuying resentfully went to the fifth floor and booked Room 507 in the east wing, paying the rent. She went out and returned in the evening with an old woman (Wang Yuying's biological mother, Wang Chen), about 40 years old, to the room, where they ate dinner together. At around 9 pm, Yuying left. Her mother closed the door and went to bed. At 10 am yesterday, the tea boy called the room (Room 507 had a private phone) because the occupant had not opened the door. After a long time without an answer, he pried open the door and found the woman lying on the bed. She had new shoes on her feet. The bedding was stained with vomit after taking poison. Three empty bottles of sleeping pills were beside the pillow. When called, her limbs were cold, but her chest was still warm. The tea boy informed the cashier, who immediately reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station. An ambulance was dispatched and sent to Renji Hospital at about 11 am. When the car arrived at the hospital, Wang Yuying, who had booked the room at the Eastern Hotel yesterday, had also been sent to the hospital by a Xiang Sheng taxi due to poisoning. After emergency treatment by Western doctors, both mother and daughter were deeply affected by the poison, and their lives are feared to be unsalvageable.</p>

<p>Gao Yunlong, from Nanjing, who works as an antique broker, went to the home of antique dealer Wang Zhongcai at No. 3, Lane 33, Houjiabang, Nanshi, on the 15th of last month. Claiming to sell on consignment, he obtained twelve ivory carvings of the Three Flower Gods and four beauties, valued at 525 yuan. On the 19th and 21st of the same month, he went to the Qiugu Antique Shop at No. 69, Jiangxi Road, and obtained eighteen ivory Arhats, eight ivory horses, and ivory statues of beauties, totaling 1,290 yuan, using the same words. After obtaining the above items, Gao sold some to Westerners and pawned others, using all the proceeds for himself. He avoided meeting with Wang Zhongcai and others.

<p>Discuss Fundraising and Promotional Strategies; Exhibition Set for 10th in Southern Shanghai</p>
<p>The office of the general team leader of the Shanghai Municipal Recruitment Team of the Chinese Aviation Association held its 32nd administrative meeting the day before yesterday (the 2nd) at 4 pm to discuss fundraising and promotional strategies. Attendees included General Secretary Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Wei Jianxin, Liu Songtao, Chen Shuo, Li Jimin, Song Zheng, Lu Zhangyan, Zhang Xiamin, Zhu Shengyang, Bao Lengxue, Gu Shangrui, Yang Peiwen, etc. General Secretary Li chaired the meeting, and Chen Shuo took the minutes. The chairman reported that the administrative meetings had been suspended four times in the past month due to the opening of the 6th National Games and the urgency of disaster relief work. He briefly reported on the work done during these four weeks. The Chinese Flying Club was formally established on Double Tenth Day and started operations at No. 146, Lane 1, Rue Lupan. Part of the fundraising proceeds was allocated to cover expenses. Secretary-General Yao and the chairman jointly oversaw the related matters. Currently, they are recruiting members, with a target of 5,000 people. Young people with potential, enthusiastic about saving the country, and deeply interested in aviation will be given training in flying skills to create grassroots civilian pilots. The location is the Longhua Flying School, which will start soon. During the National Games, the office organized the Chinese Aviation Association's Aviation and National Salvation Simple Exhibition in the city center sports field. Many secretaries and staff were assigned to take care of it. Although it only lasted ten days, it was visited by 200,000 to 300,000 people. The venue was almost impassable, which shows the city's compatriots' deep interest in aviation and national salvation. Shanghai has a population of over 3 million. During this time of national crisis, people should be made more aware of aviation and air defense. In order to popularize this, a simple mobile aviation and national salvation exhibition is being prepared. The city is divided into five areas: Southern Shanghai, Northern Shanghai, Eastern Shanghai, Western Shanghai, and the Special District. Each area's exhibition will last about 20 days, including preparation time. It has been decided that Southern Shanghai will be held first at the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road, opening on the 10th of this month. The work of each recruitment team depends on the efforts of the team leaders, deputy team leaders, and team members. Reports of progress are encouraging. A circular has been issued for phased completion, and the teams are actively recruiting. The outside secretaries should assist in the process to increase progress and complete it as soon as possible. Also, all industries are working hard to collect aviation and national salvation donations based on business income. The results of the fundraising have been announced repeatedly. It is planned to launch the collection of aviation and national salvation donations from the shipping industry, and contacts have been made and are ready. It will start soon. In addition, the aviation variety show and antique auction will be held this month to raise funds for aviation and national salvation. After the reports from each outside secretary on the progress of contact and inspection, a number of fundraising and promotional plans were discussed. The meeting adjourned at 6 pm.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Chongren, a native of Shanghai, studied painting at the St. Luke's Art Gallery in Xujiahui from a young age and possessed a remarkable artistic talent. He once served as an editor for the Illustrated Times and studied at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts for a long time. Four years ago, with the introduction of his uncle, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, and Mr. Chu Minyi and Mr. Wang Jingqi, he was recommended by the Sino-Belgian Geng款 Committee to study abroad and was admitted to the painting department of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels. He also studied at the Fine Arts Department of the National University of Brussels. The following year, in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts painting competition, Mr. Zhang's works all ranked first or second, adding glory to the Chinese art world. Major newspapers in Brussels reported on the matter, and art magazines published his works, earning him widespread praise in the art world. The Chinese Embassy in Belgium specially awarded him an honorary certificate to encourage him. Mr. Zhang continued to study in the oil painting department, studied in the sculpture department, and was admitted to the National Chemical College to study industrial chemistry, hoping to contribute to production upon his return to China. During the summer vacation last summer, he went to Paris and admired the masterpieces of past generations in the National Museum.

In June this summer, he obtained a diploma as a sculptor from the Belgian government and received a bonus of 3,000 francs. Mr. Zhang had been in Belgium for four years and made plans to return. Before returning east, he traveled to the capitals and famous cities of countries such as England, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy, especially Florence and Rome in Italy, where he enjoyed the masterpieces of art from past generations, greatly broadened his horizons, and advanced his art. He boarded the Italian ship Count Rosso on October 11 in Venice and returned home. He arrived in Shanghai last night (the 4th). Friends and relatives who went to the Jianggan wharf to welcome him all requested to hold a solo art exhibition.

They were arrested by Hua Detective Hou Fulin and Detective Ji Xiucheng of the Yangshupu Police Station, along with a wooden replica handgun. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieffen of the Third Criminal Court sentenced Tang Naikun and Wu Junshou to five years imprisonment each, and the replica handgun was confiscated.</p>
<p>French Police Arrest 13 Male and Female Armed Robbers; Seize Handguns, Bullets, Handcuffs, Iron Chains, etc. These Criminals Are Involved in Numerous Major Cases of Robbery and Kidnapping.</p>
<p>French Police Detective Jiang Futian received a tip on the 20th of last month and led detectives Wang Rusong, Zhang Daorong, Liu Jinrong, Guo Shaorong, and others to arrest Han Jinshu (21 years old, from Pudong) and Huang Caigen (23 years old, apprentice at a woolen suit shop at No. 101 Guba Road) near the intersection of Pingji Road and Lafayette Road. After questioning at the police station, based on Han’s confession, they went to No. 4 Shenyu Lane, Huacheng Road, north of Fangban Bridge, and arrested Jiang Zhian (also known as Jiang Wu, 25 years old), Jiang Anguo (20 years old, Jiang Wu’s younger brother), Wang Fuyan (20 years old), Li Jianzhi (25 years old), and others. In Jiang Zhian's room, they seized a handgun (No. 129100), 25 bullets, a pair of handcuffs, an iron chain, a handgun holster, a diamond ring, 235 yuan in cash, a gold-backed pearl ring, a Chinese Bank deposit slip for 1032 yuan, 14 pawn tickets, and 3 seals. They then proceeded to No. 5 Tongyi Lane, Beile Road, and arrested Ma Bosheng (45 years old, a detective in the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police Team in Minhang), seizing a handgun and 4 bullets, and brought them back to the police station for detention. Accompanied by detectives dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, they went to the Rixin Inn on Diandang Street in the Nanshi district, and escorted Lu Wangshi (43 years old), Lu Xiuying (20 years old), Wang Jingfang (25 years old), Wang A'er (48 years old), and Wang Kangzhang (49 years old) back to the police station. In total, 12 male and female robbery suspects, all from Nanhui and Fengxian, were arrested. The next day, they were sent to the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the First Criminal Court for interrogation. The police lawyer Chen stated that the defendants were arrested for robbery and kidnapping, and because the case was complex and involved many criminals, he requested a two-week extension for investigation before prosecution. Detective Liu Jinrong reported the arrest of the defendants and submitted the seized items as evidence. Jiang Zhian confessed that the handgun was sent to his house by Ma Bosheng, and the handcuffs and iron chain were found by his cousin when digging soil and kept at his house. The cash was entrusted to him by his maternal uncle to buy gold jewelry for his daughter's wedding, the deposit book belonged to his adopted grandfather Wang Yongxiang who sold cotton in the countryside and asked him to deposit the money in the bank, and the diamond ring and pearl ring belonged to his concubine. He denied committing robbery, but admitted to lending the handgun twice in the past. The first time, Yang Chunsheng, Jin Fusheng, Li Baorong, and Zhu Fuxiang went to rob No. 5 Xidou Lane, Ximen Road, and later gave him 150 yuan, of which he used 50 yuan and gave 100 yuan to Ma Bosheng. The second time he lent the gun, it was in a teahouse, and he did not know where they were going to rob. Ma Bosheng claimed that he was a former water police detective who was dismissed in May of this year. He was planning to surrender the handgun when the detective came to arrest him. He claimed he had never committed robbery and had never lent the handgun to anyone. He accused Jiang Zhian of falsely accusing him because he had once handled Jiang Zhian's smuggling of soil when he was a police officer. Han Jinshu confessed that he had not committed robbery, but Jiang Zhian had asked him to deliver the handgun twice. The first time, Yang, Jin, Li, Zhu, and Jiang Zhian went to rob No. 5 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road. The second time they robbed No. 101 Guba Road but failed. Huang Caigen confessed that he was an apprentice at No. 101 Guba Road. He drew the plans, and they (referring to Jiang et al.) went to rob, but failed. The other defendants all denied knowing about the robbery. The court adjourned the hearing to the 4th of this month (yesterday). The defendants were remanded in custody. At the time, because key figures were at large, the details could not be disclosed. The case is still under investigation by the police. However, two robbery cases in the French Concession have been uncovered: one attempted kidnapping, at No. 101 Guba Road, where the shop owner was grabbed, but he grabbed the kidnapper's leg and shouted for help, causing the robbers to flee. There were also two cases in Fengxian and the Caizhaoqiao village in western Shanghai. One victim has been ransomed. Because the case is complex and accomplices need to be arrested, the investigation will take time. In the interim, accomplice Chen Arong (39 years old, from Nanhui), Ma Bosheng’s partner, was arrested upon returning to Shanghai from his hometown and visiting Ma Bosheng’s house. Yesterday, the hearing resumed. The police brought the 13 male and female defendants to the Second Special Court at noon, where Judge Zhang presided over the Second Criminal Court for interrogation. The lawyers hired by the defendants, Wang Shizong, Xu Wufang, and Zhu Dianliao (represented by Lu Kaisheng), were also present. The police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that the case involved robbery and kidnapping, and was very complex, so he requested another eight-day extension for investigation. Although several defendants were not related to the case, because key figures involved in negotiating ransoms in the kidnapping case were still at large, he requested that the innocent defendants be temporarily detained in the police station for a few days until the key figures were arrested and the case was thoroughly investigated. He requested that the innocent defendants be released. The court approved the request and only questioned Chen Arong about his age and origin before adjourning the hearing to 9 a.m. on the 13th. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Four-Year-Old Case Resolved Satisfactorily</p>
<p>China's Ya Pu Er electric light bulbs have always enjoyed good sales in the Nanyang region. In 1931, because their quality and design were similar to Philips bulbs, the Dutch East Indies government used the pretext of patent issues to restrict their import, which attracted the attention of the Chinese people at the time. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs directly negotiated with the Dutch government, while instructing Song Faxiang, the Consul General in Batavia, to argue the case with the local government. After four years, the case has not been resolved. Now, it is learned that Mr. Hu Xiyuan, General Manager of Ya Pu Er Factory, has received formal notice from Consul General Song that the case has been resolved satisfactorily. Ya Pu Er electric light bulbs can still be sold freely in the Dutch territories without obstruction.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayer Association sent a letter to Mr. Philip, Acting General Manager of the Public Concession's Public Works Department, yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding a letter received from the Suzhou Native Association in Shanghai, concerning the case of Mr. Li Chuanbin, a telegraph operator at the Central News Agency, who was walking on the south sidewalk of Hankou Road on his way to work from his residence at No. 8, Tong'an Lane, on October 8th of this year at 1:55 p.m., when he was run over by Mr. Li Quewei, an employee of the Public Works Department's Taxation Office, who was driving car No. 8497 in the same direction, violating traffic regulations by driving onto the south sidewalk. Our fellow native association member Mr. Li Chuanbin was struck from behind, his leg was crushed, and he suffered internal injuries, resulting in his death. Our association has protested to the Public Works Department regarding this matter. We now find that prosecution is the standard procedure in traffic accidents, and the police authorities should handle it accordingly. However, the Public Works Department handles cases of traffic accidents involving Chinese people with extraordinary diligence, but claims insufficient evidence or lack of witnesses in cases involving foreigners, especially accidents involving public buses. Now, in the case of an accident involving an employee of the Public Works Department, they are doing everything possible to exonerate the perpetrator, disregarding the life and body of the victim. If cars can drive on the sidewalk and kill pedestrians, where is safety to be found? Are the traffic regulations of the Public Works Department not binding on Public Works Department employees? We do not know under what law this is based. In light of the above, we request your assistance in upholding justice and enforcing the law."</p>

<p>Zuozhe Bookstore Files Lawsuit</p>
<p>Pudong Middle School in this city was founded by Mr. Yang Sicheng with his own funds and is one of the leading middle schools, known for its mathematics, physics, and chemistry departments. Over the years, it has focused on improving the academic atmosphere. In 1932, a new board of directors was established, including Wu Xingya, Du Yuesheng (Chairman of the Board of Directors), Wu Kaixian, Wang Yansong, Yu Zuoting, Xu Jiqing, Zhang Shouchong, Zhu Baozhang, Zhang Xiaoliang, and other celebrities. The school quickly attracted a large number of students, reaching over 800. It is reported that the school lacks funds, so its finances are often strained. At the end of each semester, it must borrow money to maintain operations. In February of this year, the old principal of the school resigned, and the school's external borrowing was not clarified. Zuozhe Bookstore in this city has a close relationship with the school due to the sale of books. In November 1933 and January of this year, the school repeatedly and earnestly requested interest-free loans of 3,200 yuan, promising to repay them after receiving tuition fees at the beginning of the spring semester of this year. In addition to the promissory note, the school also issued four Shanghai Bank checks that expired in February. Now, the bookstore is filing a lawsuit in the local court for legal relief because the checks have expired and cannot be cashed. The bookstore has repeatedly sent letters to the school principal and directors, such as Mr. Du Yuesheng, requesting repayment. The directors, such as Mr. Du Yuesheng, sympathized with the bookstore's sincerity in supporting the school and promised that the new principal would be responsible for repayment. However, after a delay of more than half a year, the school has not repaid the debt. The bookstore has limited capital and is approaching the end of the year, so it has filed a lawsuit in the local court for legal relief. It is reported that the court will hold a hearing soon.</p>

<p>A fire broke out in the kitchen of Wang Shengtin's house at No. 48, Lane 964, Route Béteille, in the French Concession at about 7:15 a.m. yesterday. Thick smoke filled the air, and sparks flew everywhere. In the midst of the fire, Mrs. Yin Zhang (40 years old) and her daughter Yin Fenhou (12 years old), tenants on the upper floor, quickly put on their clothes and jumped out of the window, injuring their hands and legs. They were taken to Guangci Hospital by firefighters. The fire was extinguished by the firefighters, and only the kitchen was burned.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Continued Hearing in the Yan Shengquan Case of Killing Tang Akun <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Tang Akun (also known as Tang Yongshan), who resided at No. 491, Kang Nao Tuo Road, in western Shanghai, once served as the captain of the Changzhou Opium Suppression Bureau. After his dismissal, he had been unemployed. On the morning of November 16th of last year, at about 8 a.m., Tang Akun was walking on the coal cinder road near Yan's house when he was axed to death. His wife, Tang Zhu, sued the local court prosecutor, alleging that her husband was murdered by Yan Shengquan, who lived nearby, along with Zhao A'er and two others. The court arrested Yan based on the complaint. Prosecutor Xie Lian interrogated Yan and charged him with joint murder, stating that Yan Shengquan had a long-standing grudge against the deceased Tang Akun. On the morning of the incident, at about 8 a.m., Tang Akun went to Yan Shengquan's house by rickshaw. Yan had arranged for Zhao A'er and an unknown person to hide an axe and wait by the coal cinder road near Yan's house. Yan Shengquan then accompanied Tang Akun to the destination and together they axed Tang Akun in the head, causing serious injuries. Yan and the others fled without a trace. Tang Akun was rescued by the police and sent to the Red Cross Hospital, but he died of his injuries. Moreover, Yan Shengquan fled with his family immediately after Tang Akun was killed, which is strong evidence that the murder was premeditated. The crime constitutes a violation of Article 284, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Criminal Law. A trial was held once but not concluded. Yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., Judge Wu Detang specially opened the Third Court for trial. First, the plaintiff, the deceased's wife Tang Zhu, 40 years old, from Shanghai, testified that her husband, Tang Akun, was invited by Yan Shengquan to his house on the morning of the tenth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year, at around 8 a.m., claiming there was something to discuss. He left but never returned. Shortly after, the rickshaw puller Xiao Houcai returned home to report that her husband had been axed to death. Her husband had said that if anything happened to him in the future, Yan Shengquan would be the one to ask. She pleaded for justice and requested private compensation of 7,600 yuan. Next, Xiao Houcai, 32 years old, from Yancheng, testified that he was a rickshaw puller for Yan's family. On the morning of the incident, his employer took the rickshaw to Yan's house. About ten minutes later, his employer left with Yan Shengquan and three other people, heading east. His employer told him to wait there. A moment later, he suddenly heard that his employer had been axed to death. He immediately went home and told the mistress. Then, Shao Jingfan, the current Chinese Detective Chief of the Jiading Road Police Station in the Public Concession, testified that after the incident, he immediately transported the injured party to the hospital. The injured party said that he was axed by Yan Shengquan. Finally, the defendant Yan Shengquan, 36 years old, from Shanghai, testified that he was a chauffeur. He was seeking employment elsewhere but returned to Shanghai after losing his job and was suddenly falsely accused. The judge adjourned the hearing for further investigation and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>

<p>— Jinhua Ting</p>
<p>Three Departments of Work</p>
<p>Generally, a dairy farm is divided into four main departments: milk production, dairy processing, business, and accounting. The Freedom Farm is naturally no exception. Now, I will roughly describe the work situation of the farm's four departments.</p>
<p>(1) Milk Production Department (A) Matters concerning the feeding and mating of cows; (B) Research on breeding and selection; (C) Management and protection. All the above departments require expert management, but there is a real shortage of this type of talent. Even veterinary talent is scarce. Shanghai's dairy cows are also prone to many infectious diseases: (1) Pleuropneumonia, (2) Foot-and-mouth disease, (3) Rinderpest. It is worth mentioning the sources of these three diseases. Pleuropneumonia was transmitted from Russia three years ago, and dairy cows are most susceptible to this disease. Foot-and-mouth disease was transmitted from the United States last year. Rinderpest is most prevalent in Shanghai and Qingdao. Currently, there are various serums to prevent and control the above infectious diseases, but the cost is several thousand yuan per year.</p>
<p>(2) Dairy Processing Department (A) The bottle washing procedure is divided into four parts: (1) Degreasing, (2) Washing inside and out, (3) Rinsing, (4) Steaming. The same applies to milk cans. (B) Capping: The capping procedure is also divided into four parts: (1) Dust removal machine, (2) Sterilization machine, (3) Automatic temperature recording device (the milk is cooked at 145 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes), (4) Cooling machine (the hot milk must be cooled to 45 degrees). (C) Bottling machine: As long as the fingers do not touch the bottle during bottling, it is fine.</p>
<p>(3) Business Department The farm has more than a thousand subscribers. In addition to the original work, there are also the following three movements, hoping to reduce prices on the one hand and popularize milk on the other.</p>
<p>(A) Children's Milk Drinking Movement Mr. You believes that milk is the best food for children, so the children's milk drinking movement has been implemented since October 1st. His method is roughly: (1) Temporarily set a quota of one thousand people. Milk bottles are divided into two types: small bottles, half a pound, priced at 12 cents; medium bottles, one pound, priced at 20 cents. The farm has also recently shipped nineteen cows from the United States, all of which are very healthy, and plans to use the milk from these nineteen cows specifically to supply this children's milk drinking movement. In addition, a female nurse has been hired to visit the children drinking milk in various families every day on a rotating basis.</p>
<p>(B) School Milk Drinking Movement This movement aims to make milk popular in schools. It is done in two stages. The first time was last year, starting with universities. Fudan, Shanghai, St. John's, Jiaotong, Tongji, Daxia, Guanghua, and Shanghai Medical College, among other eight universities, have already succeeded. The second time is this year, proceeding from the perspective of middle school students and faculty. Many middle school students and faculty are already drinking milk.</p>
<p>(C) Institutional Milk Drinking Movement This movement has also been implemented. A quarter of a pound of milk is mixed with a quarter of a pound of black tea, then sweetened with white sugar and packaged in cans for distribution. In addition, two biscuits are provided, so that public servants in the agency can enjoy tea and snacks without leaving their office, priced at 10 cents. To avoid trouble, a voucher will be issued for easy exchange with the milk delivery person at any time.</p>
<p>(4) Accounting Department The accounting department has five staff members. In addition to managing various accounts in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, they are also responsible for compiling various statistical tables: daily reports, monthly summaries, and annual reports. This is the most important work from a management perspective.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. You also talked about the establishment process of his farm, its current situation, and future plans. The Freedom Farm was established around 1920, with a start-up cost of only ten thousand several thousand yuan. Initially, it could only do a few dollars of business a month. Now, it can do ten thousand several thousand yuan. At the same time, our capital has also increased to sixty thousand yuan. In 1926, with a capital of twenty thousand yuan, a branch farm was established in Suzhou, and the business was very good. In 1931, another branch farm was established in Hangzhou with thirty thousand yuan, and the business was only enough to maintain itself, a bit worse than Suzhou. Recently, preparations are being made to set up another branch farm in Nanjing, which is still in preparation. At the same time, twenty-four acres of land have been leased long-term in Longhua, preparing to build the main farm next year. In addition, there are two attached projects: one is the "Family Service Society," headed by Mr. Shen, whose main purpose is to handle household affairs for subscribers, such as paying water, electricity, and housing donations. The other is the "Rural Research Office," headed by Mr. Li. Currently, there are over a hundred types of Chinese and foreign newspapers, dozens of rural magazines, and hundreds of agricultural books, collecting various materials in preparation for improving the countryside. A trial run has started in Xuejiawan, Suzhou, and some progress has been made.</p>
<p>This Mr. You has a great interest in agricultural affairs, so once he started talking, he was eloquent and tireless. He graduated from the agricultural department of Cornell University in the United States, which is the most prestigious university in the world, and is particularly familiar with the situation of agricultural affairs in the United States. He made a few statistical comparisons between New York milk and Shanghai milk. He said that there are a total of 24 million dairy cows in the United States, with an annual output of about 90 million pounds. If a cow's annual output is less than 6,000 pounds, it will be slaughtered. New York receives about 5 million pounds of milk daily from all directions. There are 55 million milk transport vehicles and 32 trains with 259 carriages. The farthest distance is 450 miles, and the nearest is 44 miles. There are a total of 3,000 dairy cows in Shanghai, selling 30,000 pounds per day. If we talk about the freshness of milk, Shanghai milk is much better than New York milk, but the sales volume is far different.</p>
<p>Corrigendum In yesterday's published "Visit to the Freedom Farm," the twelve lines from "Starting with expert talks" to the sentence "Allowing the superior to survive" should be placed in the "Full Farm Tour" section, after the twenty-fourth line of the "Three Disinfection Departments," after the sentence "Not allowing development and survival." This is hereby corrected.</p>

<h3 id="e105">The Malaysian Chinese Football Team's Two Matches in the Philippines The First Match Victorious Against the Ateneo Team <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Xie Qingfu scored three goals, Yao Shenghua scored four goals. The next day, they lost to the Rizal Team with a score of 1-3.</p>
<p>(Manila News) The Malaysian Chinese football team, runner-up in this year's National Games football competition, arrived in Manila yesterday morning (26th). Five hours after unloading their luggage, they made a stunning debut at the Rizal Memorial Sports Field, defeating the famous Ateneo de Manila University team by a score of 7-0.</p>
<p>A Great Victory Over Ateneo</p>
<p>At half-past four, the Western referee blew the whistle to start the match. The Ateneo team kicked off the attack. Both sides wore the same blue shirts and white pants, making it difficult for the players to distinguish each other. After three minutes of melee, Yin Jinzhen dribbled in from the right wing. The opponent's left back rushed out to intercept, and Yin immediately passed to the center. Xie Qingfu rushed forward to meet it with his head, and the ball flew into the net, scoring the first goal amidst cheers. After losing this goal, the runner-up immediately counterattacked, but our defense was tight, and they retreated without success many times. Afterwards, the Malaysian Chinese also attacked several times, but they were too impatient, so many long shots either bounced off the crossbar or went over the goal. While the overseas Chinese community was sighing, Xie Qingfu suddenly received a pass from Yao Shenghua and again used his old trick to head the ball, and the ball flew into the net again, making the score 2-0. Because they were eager to win, the opponent's movements inevitably became irritable. Our Xu Houkun was even scratched on his left eyebrow, and blood flowed profusely. Fortunately, it was not a vital part, and Ji Youling replaced him. In the continuing battle, although the Malaysian Chinese took the upper hand, the Ateneo team's central defense line was quite tight, and the Malaysian Chinese failed to score many times. Two minutes before the end of the first half, Yao Shenghua suddenly shot fiercely with his left foot in front of the enemy's goal, 15 yards out, but it was caught. Xie Qingfu intercepted it and passed it back to Yao Shenghua. Yao did not fail his mission, using his left foot to pass the enemy defender, and then shooting fiercely with his right foot. The ball brushed in from the right corner of the goal, with a beautiful momentum. The Ateneo goalkeeper could only shake his head and sigh. At the end of the first half, the Malaysian Chinese led 3-0.</p>
<p>After the lemon break, the opponent changed sides to continue the fight. With the victory in the first half in hand, the Malaysian Chinese's attack became more fierce, and the other side also knew that they could not counterattack, so they switched to defense. This field gave the Malaysian Chinese quite a tenacious resistance. However, the Malaysian Chinese were an experienced team, and they became more courageous as they fought. Li Yiyao shot from ten yards in front of the enemy's goal, but the ball was slightly high and went over the goal. Before long, the Malaysian Chinese got a forty-yard free kick, which Xie Qingfu took. Xie lifted his foot and shot a low, fast ball. Although the goalkeeper dived, it was too late. The ball was strong and fast, winning applause from the whole field, making the score 4-0. After the center kick-off, Qingfu's ambition was not dead, and he rushed in again for a goal, but the referee ruled this goal offside, so it was not counted. At that time, the Malaysian Chinese's arrogance was at its peak, and the other side could only parry but could not counterattack, so Qingfu turned around and kicked in another goal. Yao Shenghua did not let Qingfu monopolize the glory. With the help of Xie Qingfu and Yin Jinzhen, he scored two consecutive goals, creating a half-dozen number. In order to break this goose egg record, everyone held the ambition of burning the boats. Sure enough, the war situation changed. At that time, the five forwards were invading the Philippine hinterland. Although Huang Jinbo had twice caught dangerous balls, afterwards, with the strong defense of Xie Fayu, Jian Dehui, Lin Zhiquan, and Chen Qiwan, the goal was extremely leisurely. On the contrary, Yin Jinzhen, Xie Qingfu, and Yao Shenghua successively attacked the goal, but they were all caught. In the melee, Xie Qingfu and Yao Shenghua advanced side by side into the enemy area. Yao aimed and shot fiercely from ten yards in front of the enemy's goal. The ball was like an arrow from a bow. The goalkeeper knelt to catch it, but the ball leaked out and rolled in, causing the whole field to exclaim. Until the end of the game, neither side gained anything. The Malaysian Chinese returned triumphantly with a score of 7-0.</p>

<p>Defeated by the Rizal Team</p>
<p>Another quick report on the 28th: The Malaysian Chinese football team made its first appearance at half-past four yesterday afternoon, fighting the Rizal team, the champion of all Philippine universities. As a result, they suffered a disastrous defeat with a score of 1-3. Now the competition schedule has been temporarily changed. The team is scheduled to return to Singapore on the "Cafete" wheel at twelve o'clock tonight, and will play a farewell battle against the Santo Tomas University football team at eight o'clock in the evening. The price of admission tickets has been reduced to 50 cents, 1 dollar, and 3 dollars. The originally scheduled battle against Hang Fei University has been cancelled. There are about four reasons for yesterday's failure: (1) Lack of strength, (2) Only the right forward attacked, (3) Xie Qingfu was monitored by three fierce enemy players, (4) The enemy team had better contact, and the central defender had strong skills. The battle situation was tense from beginning to end. Twenty minutes after the start of the first half, the Malaysian Chinese team's Sheng Hua took the lead in creating a record. Five minutes later, the Philippine team's Austria kicked in a goal. The first half was evenly divided, with a score of 1-1. In the second half, the Rizal team bravely attacked, and their momentum was fierce. The Malaysian Chinese team's strength had declined, and they gradually became depressed. After Austria scored another goal, they were even more panicked, causing them to lose many excellent opportunities. About fifteen minutes before the end of the game, they were shot fiercely by the enemy's center forward Austria, and the ball flew into the net, making the score 3-1. At that time, the general situation had passed, so although the Malaysian Chinese made a desperate struggle, they ultimately failed.</p>

He arrived in Xiamen at the end of August after accepting the appointment. Since taking office, he has spared no effort in library affairs, such as revising various regulations, establishing a self-service storage area, extending opening hours, and organizing card catalogs. Readers have found these changes convenient. To facilitate communication, the library also publishes a monthly newsletter, edited by Director Yu. Two issues have already been published, containing reports on library affairs, newly added books, and several academic papers on library science. The content is accurate and the editing is novel and worth reading. Furthermore, a reading competition is planned to be held soon. The details of the competition have been finalized and announced, and donations of prizes are being solicited from the university's faculty and staff to be awarded to outstanding students to encourage them.</p>

<p>— Original work by American author Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Mr. Pei had hinted that they should have academic competitions. Nannen, however, felt that using her quick wit and excellent memory was no less interesting than using her active legs and eloquent tongue. The boys also had to try their best to maintain their inherent status because Nannen had clearly shown that most of what boys could do, girls could also do, and some things they could even do better. There were no prizes in the school, but Mr. Pei's "Well done!" and Mrs. Pei's good reports in her conscience book made them happy to do their duty and work diligently, not calculating their achievements but knowing that success would inevitably come. Little Nannen had long noticed this new realm, liked it, and proved that this was exactly what she needed because there were many fine flowers in this small garden, but they were half-covered by weeds. Later, after the nurturing and cultivation of kind hands, various green shoots sprouted everywhere, blooming with brilliant flowers. The only requirement was to be able to get the loving care of the flower lover. This love and "care" is also the timely rain and sunshine for all young minds in the world.</p>
<p>Chapter 6: The Weary Birds Return to Their Nests</p>
<p>July had arrived, and the work of cutting hay had begun. The crops in the small gardens were flourishing, and the long summer days were filled with interesting embellishments. The doors of the house were open from morning till night, and the children lived outdoors except when attending classes. The homework was not long, and there were many holidays because the Pei family believed that a lot of exercise was needed to cultivate a strong body, and summer was not long, so it was best to use it for outdoor work. The children had become tanned, rosy-cheeked, and strong team; they had good appetites; very developed arms and legs, and the sleeves and trouser legs of their previous clothes were all too short. They jumped and laughed in Mei Village; they did very interesting things in the house; they went everywhere in the mountains and fields. How happy the wise Pei family was to see their group of children developing both physically and mentally!—All these, I cannot describe in detail one by one. In fact, two things were enough to make them infinitely happy, and the discovery of this matter was entirely unexpected and also most accidental.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Finance: Official Announcement of Silver Nationalization, Standard Gold Price Drops <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Multiple Parties Selling Off Results in a Decline of 15 Yuan and 7 Chous, Total Number of Chips Decreases to 12,614</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a major stabilization of sentiment due to the Ministry of Finance's official announcement of silver nationalization, the circulation of banknotes, the intention to stabilize the exchange rate against the British pound between 1 shilling and 2 pence to 3 pence, a strict ban on speculators excessively raising prices, and the Central Bank's efforts to buy and sell foreign exchange. Buyers stopped at the appropriate time, and speculators generally believed that the consecutive rumors about financial matters had come to an end and sold off their long positions. Therefore, after opening, the trend reversed and declined. Fortunately, with the support of the Central Bank, the final situation turned mediocre. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw a slight decline in London and was flat in the United States. The price of deferred silver in Montreal remained unchanged or declined by varying degrees. Exchange rates rose slightly, and the price of raw gold in London fell by half a penny. However, due to the order for silver nationalization, which had been officially announced by the newspapers, the market was extremely chaotic, with conflicting views on whether to be bullish or bearish. However, both sides did not dare to take arbitrary action and waited quietly. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with declines in both British and American currencies. The customs gold unit surged by 1 jiao, 1 fen, and 2 li, and the standard gold price was listed at 250 yuan and 3 jiao, which was well-received. However, there were no buyers at the high price, and there was a lack of supply at the low price. Therefore, the opening was delayed. After opening, major players rushed to cut their long positions, and Chinese merchants sold off as much as possible. American banks were struggling to cope. Near and far-term foreign exchange swaps were leveled out, but the situation turned loose, and a sudden downward trend appeared, falling to 115 yuan. The Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Bank of China, and others came to support it, and the exchange rate stabilized, rising back to above the 50 yuan mark. Major players continued to cut their long positions, and it was still easy to fall. The silver equalization tax had been increased to 57.25%. Buyers saw activity and repeatedly improved, but because major players sold strips at a limit price, the 50 yuan mark could not be broken. The Indian silver forecast was a small 8 annas. At noon, major events hovered, and the market situation was idle, with few buyers. Yesterday, swaps were offered by multiple parties at 25 yuan. The following is a record of the market situation for half a day.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 1160 yuan, a decrease of 3 yuan from last Saturday. Dada Yifeng Yongwan Fenghengyu Yingxiang Fuyu sold strips, falling to 35 yuan. Dadecheng Hengyu Wanxing Yifeng Yonghui Xiangyuan Chang Yongyuan Yifuxing Yongchunyuan Yong all progressed. The Central Bank bought American dollars at 30 yuan, gradually rising back to 54 yuan. Qingyu Yongfuxing Yongtong Taichang sold off, falling to 47 yuan. Huixiang Yicheng still advanced to 50 yuan. Tong Taichang Shunli sold strips, falling to 47 yuan. Dada Huixiang delivered strips, rising to 50 yuan. Fuxingyong Hengyu Yifengyong Yongli sold off, falling to 4 yuan and a half. The bank still bought American dollars, Yuanmaoyong Yicheng Hengxing delivered strips, rising back to 8 yuan. Yuanmaoyong Fuxingyong seized the opportunity to sell strips at a high price, falling to 4 yuan. Dadecheng Dada Yicheng Hengyu still delivered, rising to 7 yuan and a half. Tong Taichang Shunli still sold to 5 yuan and a half. The equalization tax suddenly announced an increase, Hengyu Dada Tongchang took the opportunity to purchase, rising to 50 yuan. Yifengyong Yuanmaoyong sold strips, falling to 48 yuan. Dadecheng delivered strips, rising to 50 yuan. Fuxingyong Yifengyong Yongli sold off, falling to 46 yuan and a half. Deli Huixiang Shenkang delivered strips, rising to 8 yuan and 8 jiao. Richang Yongli sold off, falling to 7 yuan. The Indian silver forecast was a small 8 annas, and there was still hesitation. Fuxingyong Richang sold off, and the noon closing price was 247 yuan and 3 jiao. The situation was stable after the market closed.</p>
<p>The closing price was announced by the Central Bank as the standard gold price, rising to 1150 yuan and 3 jiao. In terms of the closing price, it was 3 yuan lower, which was 71 yuan lower than last Saturday. The registration for this month was 1122 yuan, and for December it was 1147 yuan. The water replenishment in the morning was 1122 yuan. The price of pure gold decreased by 20 yuan to 1140 yuan. The spot market situation turned flat. The buying price for Tianjin goods decreased by 18 yuan, but there was no transaction. The price for smelted red gold decreased by 16 yuan, Ying Fenheng bought out, decreased by 20 yuan, Ying Fenheng bought in, all of which were done by Yin Biang Bang against 100 taels or so. The swap slightly decreased yesterday. Ying Fenheng affixed to Chunyuanyong 7 strips at 26 yuan, and another 7 strips at 25 yuan.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was extremely rare. In summary, Dadecheng Yuqingyong Dada Yicheng Huixiang Tianchengxiang Chunyuanyong Wanxing Hengxing and others were on the buying side, while Yuanmaoyong Yifengyong Tongtaichang Hengyu Shunli Shunmao Richang Fuyu Yongli and others were on the selling side. Yuqingyong Qingtiaozhi was transferred by Yicheng Yifengyong, and all others were watching. Dalian Bang Wanxing entered more than 500 strips, and Shunli did a total of more than 800 strips, with 500 strips轧 out. Guangdong Bang Shengda Pingping, Hengxing entered about 100 光景.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the market situation for half a day was extremely idle. The opening price in the morning was 1160 yuan, the noon price was 1147 yuan and 3 jiao, the highest price was 1160 yuan, and the lowest price was 1135 yuan, with a difference of 15 yuan.

<p>Chinese Merchants Selling US$5 Million</p>
<p>Central, Bank of Communications, and Other Banks Making Efforts to Absorb</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegrams, the London big strip was nearly flat, while the far-term strip shrunk by 125. The New York silver market remained unchanged, and Montreal remained unchanged or decreased by 2 li. The London raw gold fell by half a penny, the British pound rose by 375 against the US dollar, the British pound rose by 6 pounds against the French franc, the US dollar rose by 375 against the British pound, and the US dollar continued to rise by 125 against the French franc. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling and 2 and a half pence for the British pound and 29 yuan and 75 for the US dollar, which was 5625 tighter for the British pound and 1 yuan tighter for the US dollar compared to the previous closing. However, the far-term price was the same as the spot price, because the government had already announced the silver nationalization order, and it was difficult for far-term speculation to take place. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced with a decrease of 75 for the British pound and 1 and a half yuan for the US dollar. The customs gold unit rose by 1 jiao, 1 fen, and 2 li. Although the banks' buying appetite was smooth, Chinese merchants were selling off in large quantities, so the market turned from tight to loose after opening. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced a listing with a decrease of half a penny for the British pound and a decrease of 1 yuan for the US dollar, and it stabilized slightly. The Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Bank of China, and others were buying heavily. The equalization tax was raised and then leveled out, but there were still no swaps in the near and far terms. Chinese merchants came to supply, and the process hovered. The forecast for Indian silver was a decrease of 8 annas. At this moment, the general trend lacked change. The noon closing near-term selling price was 1 shilling and 2 and 75625 for the British pound and 119 yuan and 875 for the US dollar, which was half a penny tighter for the British pound and 875 tighter for the US dollar compared to last Saturday. The far-term price was the same as the spot price, which was looser compared to last Saturday. Foreign banks and the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, etc., were buying heavily, but Chinese merchants were selling off about US$5 million and 87,000 pounds. The following is a record of the transactions for half a day.</p>
<p>The British pound opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling and 2 and a half pence. The Bank of Communications bought November at 625, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation delivered December at the same price, Huabi bought November at 6875, the British Bank bought December at 625, and Lisesai had a spot price of half a penny.

<h3 id="e127">Major Changes in the Silver and Money Industry, Clearing House Closing Has Reached 2 Jiao <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Regulations on the Exchange Rate of Silver Jiao and Copper Coins are 12 Jiao for Copper Coins and 3,000 Wen</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance officially announced last night that cash would be centralized and the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications would be the legal currency, the financial industry authorities were inevitably shocked and uncertain due to the sudden changes. Therefore, they convened an emergency meeting that night to discuss maintenance measures. Minister Kong also attended the meeting and provided guidance and personally instructed the silver and money industry that if they needed chips or collateral, they could do so to the above-mentioned two banks. The prices of various subsidiary coins must be balanced and a fixed price must be stipulated. It was stipulated that the price of each jiao ocean, regardless of single or double (i.e., Jiangnan and Guangdong), would be exchanged for 12 jiao, and 3,000 wen for copper coins, without any increase or decrease. From then on, silver funds could be slightly activated. For fan industry pledges, a large number of them will probably be opened tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Therefore, the market opening prices yesterday morning were the same for both the early and noon markets at 2 jiao. The clearing house closing price also decreased accordingly. The initial opening price was 7 jiao, then 4 jiao, 3 jiao, and then 1 jiao. The final closing price was 2 jiao, and the head position was much looser than the previous day. The turnover of the clearing house bills was more than 4.4 million in the early market, more than 500,000 in new transactions, more than 300,000 in the noon market, more than 600,000 in transactions at the small general meeting, and more than 500,000 in 洋押欵 transactions. The new transactions were more active, with more than 900,000. It is expected that a large number of banknotes can be made today to convert into legal currency. Very little was recovered after the conversion into legal currency, only more than 800,000 yesterday. More than 3 million were issued. The 暗記券 will no longer be used, so there is no amount issued. According to bank news, although yesterday was Monday, and by convention there would be many collections, because it was the Western merchants' autumn race, the banks were only open for half a day in the morning. Chinese banks were open all day as usual. However, the 外汇 and other settlement relationships were not inferior. Western banks collected more than 4.2 million in bills, various goods and foreign exchange, and more than 8.45 million in the freight deposit. 1.1 million were put into storage. Chinese banks collected more than 4.67 million in bills, various goods, exchange tax, deposit, and special industry miscellaneous charges totaling more than 12 million, and 600,000 were taken out of storage. Japanese banks collected more than 4 million in bills, various miscellaneous charges totaling more than 5.34 million, and special settlement and foreign settlement charges totaling about 3 million. 50 were put into storage. Money shops and 洋公單 collected more than 52 million, 洋數頭 款 collected more than 5.3 million, various remittance charges totaled more than 800,000, and more than 1.1 million were collected in cash. Because the market price was balanced, there was no market price to record for coins. Yesterday, 111,000 strings of copper coins were traded, with a total price of 7,000 洋. Also, the total number of bills at the Clearing House on the 4th was 20,058,295 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen in national currency. The total number of exchanges was 12,887,918 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6 fen. The total number of collections was 4,461,537 yuan, 4 jiao for money shops, and 3,232,739 yuan, 8 jiao, and 6 fen for foreign banks.</p>
<h3 id="e128">4.45 Million in New Coins in October <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Central Mint Review Committee announced: For the purpose of announcement, the new coins sent by the Central Mint for review in October of this year totaled 4.45 million yuan. The committee assigned chemical inspector Ge Laide to conduct random inspections in accordance with the regulations. The fineness and weight were found to be in accordance with the silver standard coin minting regulations. A total of 890 certificates, from (23) 17881 to (23) 18771, were issued.

<h3 id="e129">Securities Except for '96, Bonds All Hit the Upper Limit <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the government's sudden announcement of currency control reform, both bullish and bearish sides frantically scurried about, and the atmosphere on the trading floor was extremely tense. Whether this measure is beneficial to public bonds is a matter of opinion, with each person having a different perspective. All sorts of extreme views were expressed. Since this is a pioneering initiative in China, the soaring of commodity prices is naturally to be expected. Public bonds, being government debt contracts, are similar in nature to paper money. Whether they will also follow the path of soaring prices is a matter of general consensus. This type of measure by the government has in fact been implemented for some time, the only difference being cash nationalization. Observing the informal market, the bulls of "78" were most active. A certain bank sold millions of units, a very large amount, with repeated fluctuations that are still ongoing. Yesterday, at the opening bell, most traders only bought and did not sell. The majority of listed bonds were pegged at a 4-yuan increase limit, but there were actually no transactions. Only '96 rose by slightly over 1 yuan and continued to be traded. All others, starting from the "Bian Yi" bonds, were once again pegged at a 4-yuan increase limit and trading was suspended. In the informal market, they initially rose by 1 or 2 yuan, but later, due to the emergence of large institutional bulls and large sales by the financial sector, the trend flattened. During this major currency reform, rumors were rampant, and it is best to remain calm and handle the situation with composure. Trading resumed at 11 o'clock at the closing bell, and "96" suddenly plummeted, dropping by 2.5 yuan, due to a sudden new rumor from the outside. As a result, except for "96", all other bonds hit the upper limit. The total transaction volume was approximately 10 to 20 million yuan. A comparative list of the resulting increases and decreases is shown below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e130">Yarn and Cotton Drastic Changes in Yarn and Cotton <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Benchmark Yarn Rises and Falls by 9 Yuan, Spot Cotton Jumps by 3 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market is experiencing wild surges and plunges, with tumultuous waves. The Ministry of Finance's announcement that banknotes from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are legal tender and that cash cannot be used has caused extreme market chaos, with various rumors spreading and widespread panic. Short sellers are in a state of disarray. Chang Feng and Da Feng are aggressively buying, further strengthening the upward momentum. Second-round prices for all months have simultaneously broken through the 200-yuan mark, reaching a new high since the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan. Subsequently, as the trend in spot gold eased, Tong Ji began to release their holdings, and Yu Da reversed course and sold short, causing prices to fluctuate sharply. The price difference reached as high as 9 yuan, indicating the anxiety of both bullish and bearish sides.</p>
<p>Near Months Weak, Distant Months Firm in Benchmark Yarn</p>
<p>The benchmark yarn market opened with a surge in all months. The market situation was extremely serious, and the atmosphere was heated to a boiling point. Buying orders were deafening, and bid prices were chaotic. Later, Tong Ji suddenly appeared and sold into the market, maintaining the situation. All months rose by more than 2 yuan. The April contract soared by 4 yuan. By the second round, the market situation became even more volatile. The intensity of both bullish and bearish sides was extremely fierce, especially the panic of the short sellers. As spot cotton soared by 2 yuan, the cotton-yarn ratio should have risen by 10 yuan, triggering a surge in buying interest. The November contract jumped by 6 yuan compared to the second round, and all months simultaneously broke through the 200-yuan mark. However, Tong Ji, Yu Da, Da Ji, and securities firms suddenly started selling in large quantities, slightly easing the pressure on the trading floor. The spot gold price remained stable, and a sudden reversal occurred. Prices in the third round fell back by 1 yuan. By the closing bell, selling pressure suddenly intensified, and prices plummeted. The February contract fell by 4 yuan compared to the third-round price. As a result, near months closed with gains of 2.40 to 2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while distant months fell by 1.50 yuan. The afternoon session opened with near months still falling by 1 yuan, but distant months rebounded. After the second round, the market turned more moderate, and trading volume decreased.</p>
<p>As a result, near months fell by 3.80 to 1.40 yuan compared to the morning closing price, while distant months rose by 0.10 to 1.30 yuan. Tong Ji sold 3,700 bales, Heng Yi 1,900 bales, Yu Kang 750 bales, Yu Da 4,650 bales, Da Ji 3,350 bales, Jin Chang 2,550 bales, Ming Hua 800 bales, Tong He 1,300 bales, He Xing 700 bales, and Ren Feng 700 bales. Da Fu bought 1,350 bales, Da Feng 3,550 bales, Sen Kang 1,250 bales, Chang Feng 7,050 bales, Xin Cheng 1,800 bales, Rui Da 1,100 bales, and Geng Lan 750 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Total       227,250</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Are Also Extremely Chaotic</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. The selling prices of factories and yarn merchants differ by tens of yuan, indicating extreme market confusion. Various groups bought a total of 500 bales. Morning prices rose by 2 yuan, and line prices rose by 4 yuan. Prices were flat in the afternoon. The purchase amounts of various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 235  Fellow Traders 30  Jiujiang 5 Nanjing 5</p>
<p>Guangdong 205  Jiangxi 10  Wuhu 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is advancing sharply and retreating quickly, with the market conditions becoming increasingly turbulent. Spot cotton jumped by 3 yuan in the first round. Such a dramatic rise is rare in history. Rumors are still rampant, and short sellers are panicking. Buying interest is active, and the pulling force is particularly strong. Chang He and Chang Feng are especially aggressive in raising prices. Later, as profit-takers released their holdings, prices plummeted. Ultimately, the trend still turned upward.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Finally Rises</p>
<p>Before the opening of the benchmark cotton market, there were rumors that trading would be difficult to open today and that there might be a settlement price. Opinions varied. Before the opening of the spot gold market, panic was even more pronounced, leading to some news that a large bull was willing to release a large amount to maintain the market. Thus, the market opened as usual at 9:30. Only buying was seen in the first round of trading. Tong Ji and Yu Da actively sold. Prices for this month and next month surged by 3 yuan. At one point, the sound of trading was deafening. Chang Feng and Chang worked to pull in more orders, and the price jumped even higher. By the time the Ministry of Finance announced that spot gold would be settled according to customs gold, the market turned to a flat trend. Yu Da and Yuan Xing were still selling in large quantities, easing the pressure on the trading floor. Prices suddenly fell by 0.70 to 1 yuan. At the closing bell, cotton yarn plummeted, and the situation changed drastically. Prices for each month fell sharply by 1 yuan. As a result, prices for each month rose by 0.40 to 0.80 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session opened with a firm tone, and prices stabilized in the second round. As the yarn market weakened, sentiment eased slightly. However, most of the bulls remained unmoved. At the closing bell, market sentiment turned upward again. As a result, prices for each month rose by another 0.05 to 0.15 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Da Chang Cheng sold 1,700 dan, Da Fu 1,000 dan, Tong Fu 1,000 dan, Tong Ji 10,000 dan, Heng Yi 4,600 dan, Yu Da 4,100 dan, Da Ji 1,500 dan, Ming De 1,100 dan, Zhen Chang 4,700 dan, Yi Cheng 2,700 dan, Yong Da 2,800 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 5,900 dan, Xin Cheng 1,900 dan, and He Xing 3,600 dan.

<p>At the beginning of the week, fluctuations largely followed US cotton. Later, due to unstable weather, prices were firmer. The November and January contracts for Oomra cotton were trending upward due to damage and delayed shipments. If inland arrivals are not abundant, it will be difficult to cover previously sold amounts. The spot market is featureless due to empty inventories and holidays. Kapas cotton is good. Other cotton-growing areas have been slightly damaged by recent rains. The statistics for the previous week are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>

<p>Flour market opened in the morning due to announcement of the legal tender, and the market was shaken up. Second round opened with extremely high prices, outside traders bought and speculators entered, each month's contract saw new record highs. The price of current month was as high as 2 yuan, 9 jiao, 9 fen and 7.5 li, December was 3 yuan, 0 jiao, 4 fen and 2.5 li, January was 3 yuan, 0 jiao and 9 fen, February was 3 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 fen, March was 3 yuan, 1 jiao and 3 fen and 5 li, April was 3 yuan, 1 jiao, 4 fen and 7 yuan and 5 li. Compared to last week's closing price, it rose sharply by 7, 8, 9 fen and more. When the market was rising sharply, Da Qing had large sales of over 400,000 to 500,000 bags, which accounted for half of the transaction volume in the afternoon. Therefore, people's sentiment was hit, and the price retraced by 3, 5, 6 fen and more from the highest price. In the afternoon, it initially recovered by 3, 5 fen, but then fell 2, 3 fen because the buying interest was not as strong as in the morning. 400,000 bags were traded in the afternoon. If there are no exchange rate disturbances, it may gradually quiet down.</p>

<p>Wheat market, because the Ministry of Finance announced banknotes as legal tender, the exchange feared the impact on various prices, and due to the compulsory requisition relationship, had to suspend the market for half a day. In the afternoon, due to the weakening of gold prices, sentiment inside and outside the industry felt stable. Only because foreign wheat was not traded, it seemed that the supply was not sustainable, and buyers were confident, so each month's price rose by an average of 7 and 8 fen. The future is uncertain. If the government wants to rescue the market, maintain people's food, it must count factory needs and order at any time, and then there is hope for easing.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, ship number 39 arrived, and the market situation was chaotic due to the government's announcement of restricting cash. At one time, it rose by about 1 yuan. After the persuasion of the Zhu and Yan members, it slightly retracted, and as a result, all goods rose by 6 and 7 jiao. The guest gang's baozi had not been opened.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, ships number 48 and 49 arrived from various gangs in Hexia. Because the Ministry of Finance announced the implementation of banknotes as legal tender, people's sentiment turned upward. The stores' morning market had good appetite, and the afternoon market slightly turned lax. The river's storage was almost empty. New indica, straight Ge kiln type, broken indica and other prices suddenly rose by 6, 7 and 8 jiao and more. Baiyuan also jumped by 6 and 7 jiao, Yangbu tip by 6 and 7 jiao, Dujian guest tip also rose by 5 and 6 jiao, and the rest of the goods also rose by 4 and 5 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market situation for Ke Xian rice suddenly changed drastically. The Ministry of Finance's announcement of the inconvertible paper money order caused excitement in all parties. The asking price for Ke Xian rice rose immediately by 8 and 9 jiao. Yonghu white rice soared by 1 yuan and 1 jiao. Foreign rice suddenly called out a high price of 1 yuan and several jiao, and the high increase made the local customers wait and see. The market turned dull in the afternoon. Jiangxi Ji Early fell from 10 yuan and 3 jiao to 10 yuan. Taizhou Liu Xian called out a high price of 11 and a half yuan in the morning, but no one was willing to buy. It was only 11 yuan in the afternoon, falling by about half a yuan. Others also need to be 3 and 4 jiao, but transactions are very small. In the morning, various parties rushed to handle a total of only about 5,000 bags. Foreign rice hoarders hope for good, so there were no transactions. Only 60 bags of Siam Xuan Yuan rice were traded, and the price was also more than half a yuan higher.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Coarse Grains All Soar <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Grain prices have been rising sharply in recent days, and people have already been impatient. Yesterday, the legal tender policy was announced, and various market prices turned sharply upward. Foreign zhuang sesame rose by 5 jiao, opening at 11 yuan, and 500 tons were traded, still with a fixed-term delivery. Spot sesame rose by 3 and 4 jiao, and more than 5,500 bags of sesame were opened. Soybeans rose by 1 jiao, and 4,000 bags of various soybeans were traded. In addition, various grains rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the Ministry of Finance announced the monetary policy, the prices of various goods rose by several jiao to 1 and 2 yuan. Prices of goods such as bamboo-joint copper bars, white lead sheets, white lead, tinplate, and company iron all rose by 1 and 2 yuan. Plain white, corrugated iron, black iron sheets, new lead wire, I-beams, and angle iron increased by 2, 3 jiao to 4, 5 jiao. In addition, goods such as Dongbai iron also rose by several fen to a jiao. Although actual transactions were not strong, the people's sentiment was quite good.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Oil Market Raw Soybean Oil Soars <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Standard soybean oil has been rising continuously since the end of last month, with no end in sight. The increase in January is as high as 5 or 6 yuan. On the first day of last month, the market price for this month was only 13 yuan, for December only 12 yuan and 9 jiao, and for January and February 12 yuan and 9 jiao and a half. Unexpectedly, the price has been rising due to consecutive telegrams and the sharp rise in gold prices. The increase has been difficult to stop. By the end of last month, the market inventory was very low, and the people's sentiment became stronger. Those who had goods recently were unwilling to sell. The prices opened yesterday were all new records: 19 yuan for this month, which is 6 jiao and a half higher than last week, 5 jiao and a half higher for December, 5 jiao higher for January, 7 jiao and a half higher for January, and 4 jiao and a half higher for March. Spot soybean oil rose sharply by 1 yuan, raw oil rose by 8 jiao, and the general trend is still tight. There is little downward movement at the moment, and transactions were not high due to low inventory. 850 units of soybean oil and 650 units of raw oil were traded.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Sugar Market Native Sugar and Foreign Sugar Rise Together <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw customs gold reach 2.274, and with the announcement of legal tender, people's sentiment rose sharply.

Re-export goods called for 7 yuan and 1 jiao, also up 4 jiao. The factory's cotton white Shi Ji number 1 called for 21 yuan and 2 jiao, up 1 yuan and 4 jiao compared to (February 2nd), but there were no transactions. Numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 were retired as is. There was a new arrival of 57 packages of new Chao Qing (number goods), the goods were of average quality, and the substance was very soft. The price opened at 11 yuan and a half. More than 400 packages of Chen Jiang Qing (goods), from 10 yuan to 10 yuan and 2 jiao, did not rise or fall much. More than 100 packages of Xinghua Chi opened, from 16 yuan to 15 yuan and 6 jiao, up about 1 yuan.

<p>Asking Prices Rise But Do Not Succeed</p>
<p>After the announcement of legal tender yesterday, the prices of dried goods such as daylily vegetables and melon seeds rose due to high demand. There was no intention to sell temporarily. At the same time, the asking prices of the trading houses also rose. Both importers and exporters are watching and waiting. But according to actual observation, the native goods and customs gold should not have problems. Although there is a possibility of rising prices, it is unlikely to reach a high level.</p>

<p>— (Zhongshe)</p>
<p>A person often picks roses far away, but tramples on the chrysanthemums at his feet. You need to know that great careers start from small things.</p>
<p>The most valuable spirit of a person is the determination not to turn back when you encounter any obstacles or blows.</p>
<p>A person's strong determination will scare away many demons who can confuse the minds of the weak; it will eliminate many difficulties and obstacles.</p>
<p>The tributary will never be higher than the source. The success of your career will never be higher than your self-confidence.</p>
<p>What can develop our strength and talents is not external help, but self-help; not dependence, but self-reliance. People sitting on the "cushion of convenience and happiness" will fall asleep.</p>
<h3 id="e142">A Record of Burying a Cow <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Shaou</p>
<p>The Agricultural Experiment Field of Jiangsu Provincial Educational College, in order to test and improve livestock breeds, once spent a lot of money to purchase multiple superior breeds of cattle, sheep, chickens, and pigs from abroad. I don't know if it's because they couldn't adapt to the water and soil, or because the breeding was not good. These foreign cattle and foreign pigs are not as prosperous as the foreigners who live in China.</p>
<p>On Double Tenth Day, the National Rural Work Discussion Conference, with 169 representatives from 99 groups in 19 provinces and cities, was held in the college. A large bull raised on the college's farm happened to die at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon. Fearing to disturb the guests, the farm's administrators secretly kept the news quiet. They dug a hole in the highlands outside the college, directly facing Mount Hui, to serve as the "resting place for the cow." After the lights were turned off at night, they quietly asked the farmers to carry it away. But they didn't know that fifteen strong farmers couldn't move it. (This "bull" weighed about 1,600 pounds.) They had to temporarily call a group of short-term workers to help. After tying it up, they were about to put it on their shoulders when the single pole (thick wood) couldn't bear the weight and suddenly broke in the middle. They had to replace it with another wooden bar, but it broke again. So they knocked on the wood shop in the middle of the night to buy wood to make a bar. It was already about 2:00 a.m. After midnight. With the strength of twenty-two people, they wanted to carry the foreign cow's body away. By the time it was buried, the sky was already turning white, and the morning rooster was crowing. It was truly "rushing to the funeral at night and crawling to the road."</p>
<p>This cow was a pure Holstein breed, worth 800 yuan. It was specially used for mating. Mating female cows outside the college requires a fee of two yuan per time. It is no different from a "male prostitute."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Waiting for Crabs <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>The seasonal winds have painted the maple leaves crimson and whitened the reeds' beards. Under the eaves of the ancient temple, decaying leaves cling to cobwebs, while the ocher hues of the autumn mountains rise distantly. Across the lonely stream lies a solitary log bridge, gazing leisurely at the thin clouds drifting by—it is once again the season for fat crabs.</p>
<p>On the slippery mudflats, scoured by the stream, crab claw marks resembling sunflower seeds are left, disorderly and crisscrossing, indicating the crab swarm's bustling activities of the previous night. However, precisely because of these visible traces, the villagers are stirred with the intention of waiting for crabs. This is something crabs themselves would never anticipate—that humans would use light to lure their lives, satisfying their appetites or imprisoning them to be sold in towns for profit, thereby enriching themselves with the lives of these aquatic beetles.</p>
<p>As the second watch's gong sound sinks into the distant village dwellings, here, a mast lamp has quietly been lit. By the creek, reeds rustle, seemingly sighing for the crabs' impending fate. Perhaps a lone wild goose slices through the long loneliness of the autumn night, but the crab-waiter pays no attention. He even holds his breath, waiting, waiting...</p>
<p>The crabs, finally, are lured onto the mudflats again, just like the previous night. However, they do not know that what lured them last night was the bright moonlight, while tonight it is the fire of the crab-waiter's mast lamp. Sadly, though the crabs possess two eyes, they still crawl toward the crab-waiter's hand. One enters the bamboo cage, while another continues to approach, one after another... The crab-waiter's face reveals a triumphant joy, and in his mind, he calculates the next day's rice wine, dry tobacco, oil, and salt—all the necessities of life. Thus, crabs are sold in the market, pickled, boiled, and pan-fried with batter.</p>
<p>All this is thanks to the crab-catchers' efforts, right? But the lives of the crabs go unnoticed. A four-year-old son picks up two crabs from somewhere, pins them to the wall, and claps his hands. Is it that humans are cruel from a young age? If so, then I must not blame the crab-waiters.</p>

<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>For the sake of my job, I sit in a guiltless prison all day long. Normally, I am not easily allowed to step beyond the bounds. Therefore, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, besides changing my clothes like everyone else, I live so mechanically throughout the year, never having the opportunity to stroll through the spring countryside or enjoy the autumn scenery.</p>
<p>Now, I have finally obtained a more leisurely occupation, which often allows me to go to the park for a walk or a quiet sit. Thus, I have seen the bare branches on the old trees, and I have stepped on the yellow leaves in the grassy paths. However, although all these scenes inevitably carry a heavy sentimental tone, and every corner seems to be piled up with infinite feelings of desolation, the people visiting the park are still so active. I believe that the hearts of most young people must be filled with excitement and joy. Whenever I sit on that chair by the pond, musing or daydreaming, I always hear the laughter of young men and women and the singing of children, drifting gently in my ears, drifting. But loneliness in my heart cannot be driven away.</p>
<p>"Can I also return to childhood and forget the traumas of life?" I ask myself, but besides a bitter smile, there is no comforting answer. I still stare at the white clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>"Autumn!" A yellow leaf floats down from above and falls on my lap. I carefully push it to the ground, where it happens to be crushed by the high heels of a modern girl. At this moment, a wave suddenly stirs in my heart, as if her step was stepping on my heart. My heart is also crushed: "Life is short, life is limited. How am I going to pursue my life? But, but my youth has already been driven away by life!" I silently stood up, walked through the woods, and stared at a group of children by the pond in a daze.</p>

<h3 id="e146">A Brief Record of Shooting Riddles <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Mei</p>
<p>There is a poetry society at sea, initially named Seeking Sound, later called Singing Society. Recently, on the occasion of its twentieth anniversary, it specially sent letters to summon society members from far and near for a gathering to reminisce about the past. After the drinking and singing, Sun Shushi and Yao Jinqiu prepared riddles as rewards, hanging lanterns for subtle shooting. It reached a peak of popularity for a time.</p>
<p>Among the society members who are good at shooting riddles, Ye Youqin and Yao Zhuxuan should be mentioned. Yao even has the nickname of "Tiger-Fighting General." Others such as Jia Shuxiang, Zhu Dake, and Zheng Zhian are all skillful as well. Guests from outside the society who are adept at this skill, such as Shi Jiqun, Lu Dan'an, and Xu Xingsu, also came to attend. They rubbed shoulders and stood around the riddles, focusing their minds and pointing at their palms, their elegant interests, how wonderful!</p>
<p>The wife of society member Wu Qinmu is quite skilled in calligraphy and painting, and is particularly clever at solving riddles. She correctly answered five of Jinqiu's riddles in a row. I noted their solutions: "One son Shu serves in government" was a riddle from Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. "Shang Sanguan" was the answer. "One by one east" was a riddle for a character name from Water Margin: Dong Ping. "Young couple" was a riddle for a character: Sha. "Evil guest" was a riddle for a character: Fan. "A blind man riding a blind horse" was a riddle for a dialect: "Scolding the monk for being bald." From this, readers can imagine her hand waving and eyes following, with wonderful thoughts arising continuously. At that time, I was on the side and suddenly had a flash of inspiration and got a riddle, intending to tease Qinmu, it read: "Mrs. Wu guessing riddles, riddle from the Four Books:" The answer was: "A wife does not speak, but when she does, she is always right." But my friendship with Qinmu was still shallow, and I was afraid he would be angry, so I did not dare to reveal it! I also saw a riddle: "Fond of ancient prose, riddle from Peking Opera:" Kaitian Pidi (The Creation of the World), because "good" in ancient times was written with the characters Zi and Chou. According to tradition, the sky opened at Zi time and the earth split at Chou time, hence the saying. It was correctly answered by his daughter, Wen. It can be said that the whole family is elegant, which is enviable!</p>
<p>My brain has been injured for a long time and cannot withstand thinking, so I only solved one riddle, fortunately successfully. It was: "A dream, a phantom, a bubble, a shadow, dew, lightning, pull up the blindfold, riddle from the Thousand Character Classic:" "Like the Six Classics." The gift I received was a standing scroll of reed geese by Jinqiu, which is extremely valuable, and my heart was extremely happy.</p>
<p>In two days, no fewer than a hundred riddles were solved. I have copied some of them to share with everyone. However, for the sake of length, I will not list the names of those who solved them. For example: "Society, riddle from the Three Character Classic:" "The Xiahou clan used pine, the Yin people used cypress, and the Zhou people used chestnut." "Thousands of wrongs, ten thousands of wrongs, all are the fault of the young student, collection of Kunqu opera titles:" "Till Dawn, Carrying Thorns. Visiting Fan Xie's concubine's tomb three times, collection of Kunqu opera titles:" "Bowing to the Moon, Visiting the Grave." "Asking the man about the matter of welcoming Peach Leaf? Eyes slowly approach the stream and row the oars. Collection of Kunqu opera titles:" "Interrogating the Husband, Taking a Concubine, Aunt Blocking, Crossing the River. One Luo Yin, riddle from the Six Arts:" "Autumn clouds roll across the sky." "Word, riddle from the Six Arts:" "How can someone come to send a message?" "Once dusk arrives, one is no longer lonely, names of two beauties:" "Yelai, Shuangcheng." "Unintentionally not creating sin, with a mouth it is difficult to speak, riddle character:" "Asia." "Easy to collect county names: Two: Golden Chest, Wuxi." These were all written by Master Shushi. Also, for example: "No, virtue is unworthy of the imperial throne, riddle from the Four Books chapter:" "Yao Said Twentieth." "Peerless beauty, collection of rhyme titles thirty-one You, five objects, fifteen Shan." "Fisherman, collection of two county names: Fenshui, Shangyu." "Give it a piece, riddle character:" "Servant." "Riddle from Ming rhyme titles:" "Eighteen Skillful." "March spring, riddle character:" "Agriculture." "Gongsun Qiao's great-grandfather, riddle from Changli prose, roll up the blindfold:" "National Son." "Classic collection of Kunqu opera titles, visiting the grave, later demanding." "Make the ruler, make the teacher, collection of Kunqu opera titles:" "Former Relative, Later Relative." "Only Zhongshu's situation is not broad, and his appearance is particularly haggard, riddle from the Four Books, names of three people:" "Meng Gongchuo, Ji Sunfei, Gongsun Yan." "Goods, riddle from the Four Books chapter:" "For Government Second." "Not fallen to the ground, riddle from Jin prose:" "Born child six months." "A promise is naturally extraordinary, riddle character:" "Although." "Eldest grandson, second grandson, riddle from the Four Books, names of two people:" "Zi Zhi, Meng Zhongzi." "Leaving home young, returning old, riddle from the Four Books, names of two people:" "Ji Lu, Meng Zhifan." "Bow knife, riddle from the Six Arts:" "Embroidered shoes are just half folded." These are the works of Jinqiu.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-One: Gently Relying on Others, Appreciating the Moon's Beauty in the Courtyard; Angrily Scolding the Son-in-Law, Listening to the Lion's Roar from the Next Room</p>
<p>After a wave of distress in her heart, Yueying had paused for some time, and naturally collected the tears that were about to flow out. She continued to him: "My father, seeing that situation, naturally dared to stop them. But he couldn't help but feel sad when they insisted on cutting all the wheat in the field, so he shouted loudly and fell to the ground. The officer was also in the wheat field, watching the soldiers cut the wheat. Seeing my father fall to the ground, he felt compassionate and said to my father: 'Don't be sad, when our pay arrives, we'll reward you with some money.' My father lay on the ground unconscious for a while, then woke up, and said: 'If you're waiting for future pay to reward me with money, it's better to reward me with some grain now. I worked so hard to grow so much wheat, but I haven't tasted a single grain. Don't you think I'm wronged?' The officer laughed and said: 'Since that's the case, why don't you join my camp as a soldier? We have plenty to eat, and you'll naturally have plenty to eat too.' My father said, 'My family has several mouths to feed, all relying on me alone. If you take me to be a soldier, who will take care of my family?' The officer said it well, 'Which soldier doesn't have a family? Do you think you're the only one with a family?' When the officer said this, the soldiers under his command thought he was going to enlist my father, so without allowing any explanation, they dragged my father away. At that time, we were all at home and didn't know about this. We only found it strange when we didn't see my father return in the afternoon. These soldiers lived in our fort, constantly going in and out. One of the quick-tongued ones sent us a message, and we learned that the grain was gone and the person was gone too." (355)</p>

<p>"Hurry up! Don't delay any longer!" Finally, she urged us on, in a reversed manner. No matter how unfavorable this omen is, we must go out immediately! I think something must happen in this morning's court, at least a piece of bad news. Perhaps at this moment, that old man Qing Shun (i.e., Grand Councilor Prince Qing) already has an memorial in his sleeves that is greatly unfavorable to us.</p>
<p>Her extremely arbitrary prediction was originally not permitted by reason, and I didn't dare to believe it at the time, but what happened later was exactly as expected, truly a coincidence! Now let me slowly describe it, and readers can believe it or not as they please.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager always took a group of us out with her to court every day, as usual. She was doing the same this day. I carefully watched her from behind, only to see that she was walking much faster than usual today, but although fast, her steps were very hurried and sometimes crooked, unlike her usual stability. Instead, she fully displayed the walking posture of an ordinary old woman. From this point of view, that magnolia flower that suddenly bloomed in the garden had indeed threatened the Empress Dowager, revealing her old age!</p>
<p>When we entered the main hall, the Empress Dowager's ministers were already waiting below the hall. As soon as they saw the Empress Dowager arrive, they knelt down together without hesitation, respectfully kowtowing and reporting their names to pay their respects. This was an old routine that I was tired of watching, so there is no need to describe it in detail. After everyone had paid their respects, Prince Qing remained kneeling, waiting for the Old Buddha to grant him the special permission to speak. (451)</p>

<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Issue of Salaries for Elementary School Teachers in Our Country <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Everyone acknowledges that elementary school teachers in our country live in great poverty. Their meager salaries are barely enough to sustain their personal lives.</p>
<p>Salaries of elementary school teachers in all countries are superior to those in any part of our country. The lowest salary in our country, such as in Shaanxi, is twenty-four yuan per year. The highest salary, such as in Hubei, is one thousand eight hundred yuan per year. But these refer to the lowest and highest salaries in the entire country. In general, an elementary school teacher can earn an annual salary of two hundred to four hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Education is the fundamental plan for establishing a nation. Whether a country's education is developed or not is of great importance to the rise and fall of the country. Nowadays, countries around the world, such as England, America, and France, are becoming increasingly powerful. In addition to strengthening their military forces, the development of education is undoubtedly the greatest reason. Investigating the underdevelopment of education in our country, although there are many reasons, the meager salaries of teachers should be a fatal problem. Therefore, if our country does not talk about reforming education, then so be it. If we want to reform education, we must first start with improving the salaries of elementary school teachers. Because if the salaries of elementary school teachers are not improved, our country's education will not be improved for a single day. I hope the education authorities will pay close attention to this point.</p>
<p>It is said that Italy requires elementary school teachers to pass a national examination before they can be employed. Once employed, it is a lifelong position, and the state cannot change their position without reason. The situation in Japan is the same as in Italy. Thus, teachers' salaries are superior, and they are dedicated to their work. Having such a solid and superior guarantee in life allows them to fully develop their talents and devote themselves to the education cause they are engaged in.</p>
<h3 id="e150">The Government Inspector <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>—Amateur Actors Performing in Jin City—</p>
<p>"The Government Inspector" appeared before my eyes for the first time, but I have been yearning for "The Government Inspector" to appear for several years. I had this thought when I read the play.</p>
<p>There are many difficulties in staging this play: the characters' personalities are not easy to grasp, one; the tone is not easy to unify, two; the costumes, props, and sets must match the Russian court of the early nineteenth century. Although it is not difficult to find reference materials, it is difficult to make them realistic. When this play was first staged in Russia, its poor performance provoked the original author, Gogol, to protest angrily.</p>
<p>Although Gogol's plays are not many, since "The Government Inspector" was published, it was as if a bomb had been dropped on the Russian theater scene, sweeping away the clownish jokes and the boring nonsense, and turning into serious laughter and scolding, the scourging of life, and the punishment of ugliness. He used his unrestrained and sharp pen to fully display the corruption and foolishness of the feudal officials of Russia at that time, as well as the ugliness of the group affiliated with that class, in a short five-act play. Gogol put a lot of effort into this, fulfilling the responsibility of a midwife transitioning from feudal society to capitalist society. He is a great "critical realist." The postures of the characters, such as the county magistrate, principal, hospital director, judge, postmaster, shrew, merchant, and the fake government inspector, are the entire foundation of the Russian superstructure at that time. This outline of a hater of the world is typically and dialectically imaged, is it not? Even the "smell of alcohol" on the juror's body is because "his mother harmed him when he was a child." He has a particularly sensitive "nose" and has smelled all the stench on the bodies of officials all over Russia after only being a low-level official for a month or so, and from here he issued a critique that even Emperor Nicholas felt stank. If you remember the judge repeatedly mentioning selling dogs, you will smile knowingly! This is no different from his method of writing novels. In terms of structure, apart from the monologue in the first act, which is now considered inappropriate, the entire play is tight, and each act is tighter than the last, so that the audience's heart is constantly disturbed by the progress of the tense plot. If you compare Molière's many comedies with "The Government Inspector," not only are the styles different, but the structures are also very different. I dare not say</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>that Molière's works are inferior to Gogol, but Molière's works are sometimes too relaxed due to looseness, and the depth of portrayal is not as venomous as Gogol's, which is obvious to all.</p>
<p>Speaking of this performance, the overall achievement is above "Nora." The allocation of roles, the composition of the stage, the design of the costumes, and the coordination of the sound effects were carefully crafted, especially the personalities of the characters and the tone between the acts, which were done to more than eighty percent. Of course, there are also shortcomings, such as sometimes being too exaggerated and close to civilized drama. For example, that character Yin Xiucen is a vulgar clown, and it is unlikely that he would be among the gentry of the county. In terms of sound effects, when Ye Luxi looked at the "Government Inspector" and danced and sang, there was a lack of musical accompaniment and footsteps. Using drums to accompany the slapping was not realistic enough.</p>
<p>In terms of the actors, Gu Eryi was good in everything except for occasional inaccurate pronunciation. He seemed to have more than enough energy for such a heavy play. Jin Shan was too weak in the first act, playing the character of a playboy into a coy woman. Hunger will never change a person's character in an instant, but after that, each act was more vivid than the last. Wang Ying and Ye Luxi played the mother and daughter's jealousy, and every word and movement struck people's hearts. The facial expressions were particularly flexible—but Miss Wang's makeup was a little too beautiful. Compared with her daughter Ye Luxi, it was impossible to tell that they were mother and daughter, but rather a pair of sisters. Zheng Junli looked very much like a capable Russian official, but his words and actions were so weak. A judge in the feudal era should still have a considerable amount of majesty. He was a competent one, without any characteristics. Zuo Ming's old servant, he performed with skillful techniques, from which we can see that he probably did not rehearse much, because sometimes his movements were very flustered, but when I went to see it again on the second night, he was much calmer than the first time. Gu Menghu does not have many plays, but apart from a slight lack of posture in walking, both times he read the letter were quite funny, and that kind of seemingly true but not true attitude is precisely Gogol's style. Yin Xiucen and Liu Mang had already announced in the instructions that they were a pair of Laurel and Hardy, but unexpectedly they really acted as Laurel and Hardy. Gogol arranged this pair of characters to complete the epitome of feudal politics with laughter and tears, but they completely acted as laughing characters, which was wrong. Shi Chao almost turned into an idiot when he saw the government inspector, and the scene of eating a cigar, forcibly spitting the smoke on the ground, seemed too exaggerated, but this is the director's responsibility. In addition, Lan Pin, Zhu Mingxian, Jin Yi, and He Kangli were all competent, but I could not even hear what Ms. Wu Ling was saying.</p>
<p>All in all, the result was not ordinary.</p>

<p>— Wang Youhou</p>
<p>As soon as the sky began to brighten, Little Sanzi's mother called him up. She was an abandoned middle-aged woman who had been struggling to make a living with her only asset—Little Sanzi—since her husband fled. Now Little Sanzi could also pick up some trash to help her. But when she saw the fatigue on her son's face every day when she called him awake, she always felt a hidden pain in her heart.</p>
<p>"Have you washed your face? Hurry up! It's already late!" she said, looking at Little Sanzi's face, then raising her head to look at the sky, and continuing to mend the unfinished torn clothes in her hand.</p>
<p>Little Sanzi didn't say a word from beginning to end, carrying the trash basket on his back with an empty stomach, and left!</p>
<p>She rushed out, calling,——calling him back to eat, but he left without turning his head.</p>
<p>Little Sanzi had a good companion, Ah Hu next door. They went to pick up trash together every day and played together.</p>
<p>"Hey! Look! There's something over there!" Ah Hu discovered something new, it seemed.</p>
<p>"Ah! A doll!" Little Sanzi ran over and picked it up, thinking it was his good luck.</p>
<p>"I saw this doll! Why did you take it? Give it back to me quickly!" Ah Hu argued with Little Sanzi, with a threatening tone.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Give it back to you! You wish! I picked it up." Little Sanzi said stubbornly.</p>
<p>"Hmph! You won't give it to me? Look! Look at the bomb that your ancestors brought from overseas! Can you handle it?" Ah Hu took out a foreign bottle from the broken basket, making a fighting posture.</p>
<p>"I won't give it to you, I definitely won't give it to you, I've never been afraid of fighting!" Little Sanzi stubbornly said.</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>The sound of crying resonated next to the trash can in the alley. Little Sanzi's head was broken by Ah Hu; he lay in a pool of blood with his eyes tightly closed. The trash basket was also crushed by others. Many people surrounded him. Finally, an ambulance took him to the hospital, but his mouth was mumbling——"My doll! My doll!"</p>
<p>At lunchtime, his mother waited for him at the door, but she never saw her son's shadow until evening.</p>
<h3 id="e153">On Wheels <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Le Jian</p>
<p>The ocean liner rested in Xiamen harbor for a while, re-filled its belly with rouge powder fragrance, suits, and English, then slowly cranked up its iron anchor again, heading straight for Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the steerage, clusters of young men and women gathered, mixed together, exhaling powder fragrance, permeated by a peculiar stuffy air unique to the ship's cabin, suffocating people's lungs like a worn-out cloth. Precisely because of this, and out of curiosity towards the singing and laughter of a group of men and women at the stern, my aimless legs invariably led me to the stern, where I leaned against the railing, breathing in the refreshing sea breeze, and silently counting the waves bursting from each swell; or I would feign a weary expression, turn my body, lean sideways on the railing, and observe the entertainment of that group of young men and women.</p>
<p>There was a solitary White Russian, a healthy and sturdy tall man, with a face the color of bread crust, his clear gold and brown pupils fixed in the middle of light blue eyeballs, wooden and expressionless. His luggage consisted of a small trunk, covered with baggage tags from many ports, which was enough to prove his drifting and unsettled life. Moreover, from his coarse clothing, one could infer that he was a worker.</p>
<p>In his wooden gaze, there seemed to be a deep-seated stern and cold light, fixed and sharp, making me afraid to look him directly in the eye.</p>
<p>Several times, I stared blankly at the white gulls on the sea, fluttering and soaring, shattering wavelets one after another, and catching drops of water. Lost in thought, my gaze was drawn back by the delightful laughter behind me, and I watched that group of innocent children of the South Seas perform kissing gestures. But the corner of my eye felt an inexplicable threat, piercingly approaching, and I timidly glanced sideways, only to discover it was her two wooden yet sharp eyes, as if they were watching me.</p>
<p>Finally, I couldn't suppress my anger, and I angrily shouted at him:</p>
<p>"What are you looking at..." I looked him in the face, but at a glance, I found his eyes were kind, with a simple and wooden luster.</p>
<p>This embarrassed him, he went from astonishment to unease, looking around, but there was no one else. His embarrassment aroused my regret. I fled awkwardly from the stern, returning to the nauseating cabin.</p>
<p>After that, I never strolled over there, I didn't want to see him, until—</p>
<p>The next afternoon, the ship was filled with clamorous noise, and I finally ran there, squeezing in and craning my neck to look. I heard an old ticket inspector expounding his theory.</p>
<p>"No ticket, no ride. We can't be careless!"</p>
<p>"I have a ticket," he said haltingly in broken Cantonese.</p>
<p>"I have a ticket, I'm going to Xiamen to find my wife and son." Everyone else spoke a hundred sentences, but he only had this one sentence; until several heavy slaps landed on his cheeks, he still only had this one awkward sentence.</p>
<p>"Haha, Xiamen is long gone, left behind!" Everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>He was clearly a little confused, and let the ticket inspector search his pocket for the only four foreign coins he had to pay for the fare.</p>
<p>"I do have a ticket, I'm going to Xiamen to find my wife and son!"</p>
<p>At this moment, I vaguely saw several clumps of small birds in the horizon, predicting that the ship would dock at the Shanghai pier early tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Beihai Park <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ni</p>
<p>"In the eighth month, the barbarian sky flies snow," beyond the pass, it should be a season of wind and snow, covered roads, and ice everywhere. In the old capital, protected by the Western Hills like a screen, although it hasn't reached the severe cold of breathing and turning into ice, the chilling north wind and the sight of falling leaves flying all over the sky cannot help but evoke a bit of desolate and lonely power.</p>
<p>Wrapped in that old camel-hair robe, dragging my heavy steps, surrounded by dust, I entered the gate of Beihai Park alone.</p>
<p>Strolling, strolling, I climbed the White Pagoda. Looking up, the golden glazed tiles of the Forbidden City emitted a brilliant light in the setting sun, the towering ramparts of the Forbidden City were so somber and magnificent. Coal Hill, which once left a tragic page in Chinese history, was especially gray in the midst of swirling smoke. Then, expanding my vision; the towering greatness of Zhengyang Gate may make your emotions tense, and the blue roof of the Peking Library may evoke a bit of poetic and artistic feeling.</p>
<p>Facing the wind, letting the falling leaves hit my face, I forgot my homeland thousands of miles away. Sorrow, depression, and boredom were all blown away by the north wind.</p>
<p>After gazing for a while, seeing that the sun was about to hide behind the Western Hills, I hastily descended the pagoda and quietly slipped into Yilan Hall. The lotus flowers of Beihai had withered long ago, and the lake water couldn't withstand the blowing of the north wind last night, it was frozen.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the height of summer, how lively it must have been here! Women in cicada-wing-like clothes, arm in arm with gentlemen, strolling back and forth, how vibrant! At this time, you might find a few short-bearded Japanese people sitting under the green willows, fishing. Yilan Hall was even more indispensable for those petty bourgeoisie to put on a show of talent. Gathering in small groups, sitting around, sipping tea, and letting the cool breeze drive away the heat from their bodies, what a leisurely scene. But how long ago was it that the north wind drove away the gentlemen and ladies? Leaving this cold and desolate hall to be occupied by those sparrows, jumping freely and without restraint.</p>
<p>With a desolate heart, I strolled out of the long corridor, and my hand would involuntarily caress the jade stone railing again. This feeling was truly like reluctantly parting with a departing lover.</p>
<p>Leaving Yilan Hall, treading along the avenue lined with ancient cypress trees, even though it was winter, the needle-like cypress leaves were still so green and lovely. No wonder tourists from afar, upon reaching this place, couldn't help but praise them.</p>
<p>The darkness of night made my steps quicken. Walking to the Nine Dragon Wall, I stopped, panting, and carefully observed this ingenious creation. The lifelike dragons seemed about to soar into the clouds. Knowing that I was not an artist, I dared not arbitrarily criticize this precious wall, but it certainly made me never tire of looking at it.</p>
<p>The Five Dragon Pavilions became even more exquisite and lovely in the dim night. The golden yellow of the glazed tiles and the green of the cypress leaves, intricately mixed, with clear lines, were the best picture.</p>
<p>Night was gradually falling, and the chattering of the birds in the treetops and the mournful cries of the crows drove me out of the gate of Beihai Park like an eviction notice. Looking back, the Five Dragon Pavilions, leaning quietly by the water's edge, looked like a few fireflies lying there.</p>

<p>Forever Dear</p>
<p>I remember; that year's winter: the cold wind was blowing, the white snow was falling, the sparrows under the eaves, quietly and silently, perched on the beams of the building, happy and safe, stirring in my brain. I remember; I remember; I remember my love, she has a beautiful face and a clever talent, which truly makes me intoxicated with love. Forever dear, forever dear, forever dear.</p>
<p>I remember; that year's autumn: the morning breeze was brushing, the dewdrops were twinkling, the autumn insects in front of the courtyard, chirping and chirping, surrounding the front of the steps, infinite joy, faintly imprinted on my heartstrings, I remember; I remember; I remember my love, she has a beautiful face and a clever talent, which truly makes me intoxicated with love. Forever dear, forever dear, forever dear.</p>
<p>I remember; that year's summer, the evil wind was howling, the dark clouds were piling up, the swallows in front of the window, coming and going, occupying the beams and the hall, building nests for self-comfort, a sound stimulating my chest, I remember; I remember; I remember my love, she has a beautiful face and a clever talent, which truly makes me intoxicated with love, forever dear, forever dear, forever dear.</p>
<p>I remember; that year's spring: the clear wind was gentle, the drizzle was gradual, the bees and butterflies outside, fluttering and dancing, flying among the flowers and grass, you and I lingered. A pair stirring my eyes, I remember; I remember; I remember my love, she has a beautiful face and a clever talent, which truly makes me intoxicated with love, forever dear, forever dear, forever dear.</p>

<p>Page 19</p>
<p>Much intent is but foolish affection. Ill-fated beauties have been so called since ancient times. Pitiable is the fate of the ghostly beauty, after she is departed; the Xiaoxiang is always without spring. The Yi Hong's young gentleman has given his affections; crying before the coffin, his heart is crushed. One only sees that; the grass and trees are withering, the sounds are still, the desolate scene is full of shadows. The parrot does not know the feelings of the heart; chanting the burial of flowers. Seeing the saddle, one must think of the horse. Gambling on objects, how can one not think of the person. Sister ah. Your unparalleled talent and beauty have disappeared. Only leaving relics. You went to the underworld bearing resentment. Thinking back. As children together. Today we cannot be as intimate as before. Thinking back. Playing, watching the moon and writing poetry. Today we cannot sing and compose. Thinking back. Our hearts were closely linked. Today we cannot be together. Thinking back. Your every smile was beautiful. Today we cannot see your face and hear your voice again. I am silently praying before you. Do you know it in the underworld. Sorrowfully, tears are flying. Drunk and in a trance. This is really so. Wealth and glory are like a spring dream. Life is like autumn clouds. It is better to jump out of this land of worry. And cut off this unfinished love. A free and unrestrained man.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhou Jiaoqing was hired by Zhonghua Book Company two years ago to broadcast basic English on the Yongsheng Radio Station, which was probably the earliest to teach English over the air in Shanghai. Recently, Yongsheng Radio Station has stopped broadcasting for many days due to license issues. The original educational programs of Mr. Zhou Jiaoqing's Shuangshi Culture Society, professional English, and correct pronunciation, etc., will be broadcast on the Li Shutang Radio Station starting this month, from 6:30 AM to 7:30 AM every day. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, teaching professional English, "Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, teaching English E sound, and every Sunday from 7:00 to 8:00 at the Zhongxi Radio Station teaching E sound. The textbook is 30 cents per volume, available at the Li Shutang Radio Station on Baike Road, the Zhongxi Radio Station on Fourth Avenue, and major bookstores. Mr. Ma Xingtao, greetings: Your manuscript is too long, and there is no space to publish it at the moment. However, the editor feels that it is necessary to say a few words about those untrue messages. Although Mr. Shen stated the "Recent Events in the Singing Stage" in the New Night News on the 28th. Adding "Aftersounds" is for the readers' request to publish a little more news and interesting things, but often for a trivial piece of news, (the editor thought it was irrelevant when sending the manuscript) it caused great disputes, so I declare again, I hope that the contributors, when "spreading rumors and creating trouble", first ask their own "conscience"; although there are indeed "facts", I want to "shirk responsibility" and cause trouble. Regarding Mr. Ma's statement this time, it is for the "buying a suit on Wusong Road" issue. If it is true, it is not a very indecent thing, otherwise it seems that the "rumormonger" has ulterior motives. I think they are waiting for your correction letter to laugh for a while. It is not necessary to waste precious time to answer those rumors that are obvious at a glance. What do you think, sir? Finally, I hope the contributors to Yuyin will forgive me for often not knowing what to do with the correction letter. "Yuyin" needs accurate news and harmless interesting things. (Editor)</p>

<p>Old Woman Gong Jianong plays a villain selling poison pills in "The Emerald Horse". When his poison mechanism was discovered by Wang Zhengxin and checked, he became very flustered, which seemed to be a warning to him, so if he wanted things to go smoothly, he had to punish Wang Tiemin.</p>
<p>One night, the moonlight was so dim, making it feel particularly quiet and terrifying. The old woman, carrying a pistol, secretly sneaked into Wang Weixin's residence. At this time, Old Wang was sitting under the lamp, studying the methods of solving the case. The old woman took advantage of his solitary meditation and shot a bullet at him from outside the window. But Wang Zhengxin's shrewdness was truly like a divine being, unpredictable. He tilted his head and dodged it. At the same time, he very shrewdly slammed the table lamp to the ground with a "bang", and the whole room was immediately dark. Although the old woman outside the window was shooting bullets like a string of pearls, because she lost her target, none of the shots were effective. Of course, at this time, the old woman panicked, and the situation was no small matter. While continuing to fire a few shots, she hurried away. By the time the great detective's men arrived fully armed, the old woman had escaped without a trace.</p>
<p>When "The Emerald Horse" was being screened at the central location, several Misses and little angels almost screamed when the scene was shown on the screen. Of course, the thrilling scenes in "The Emerald Horse" are not limited to just this one scene. This is just one example.</p>

<p>Qin Tong Humiliates Wang Yin, Yuan Meiyun Cries</p>
<p>Yihua Company's new sound film, directed by Yue Feng, "Night of the Wedding Candles," filmed the following scene yesterday.</p>
<p>A rural house surrounded by green mountains and clear waters is where the famous writer Wang Xitao's writing career is located. On this day, Xitao was buried at his desk, engaged in writing a lengthy romance novel with marriage issues as the main theme, when suddenly his lover, Ye Caiyun, ran over to see him. Caiyun is a beautiful girl with an unspoiled innocence, and she lives not far from Xitao's house. Xitao quickly pushed the manuscript aside and stepped forward to greet Caiyun and sat her down on a chair. But at this time, Xitao suddenly found her eyes filled with tears, so he asked her in surprise what it was for? At first, Caiyun refused to tell the reason, but later, unable to resist Xitao's gentle persistence, she slowly complained, "Our affair has already been known to the Li family (Caiyun's fiancé's family). Just now, my father was called to scold them, and when he came back, my father vented his anger on me, even severely beating me and scolding me for being cheap and calling you a con artist and a bad guy. Later, he also said that if he found me with you again in the future, he would kill me." As Caiyun said this, she began to cry sadly. Looking at Wang Xitao, his teeth were clenched tightly, and he glared in one direction in grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Caiyun continued, "Now that my father has gone out, my mother, feeling sorry for me, secretly let me out and told me to ask if you have a solution?"</p>
<p>"In a few days, after I finish writing this novel, I'll take it to a bookstore in Shanghai to exchange it for money, and wouldn't that be enough to return the money to the Li family?" Xitao comforted her in this way.</p>
<p>But just when the two were talking very happily, Caiyun's father had tracked them down. Seeing the intimate situation of the two, he couldn't help but be furious, scolding Xitao for being a bad guy, a con artist, a vulgar thing, and a lecher, and angrily dragged Caiyun away. What about Xitao? He could only stand there blankly, watching her go.</p>
<p>Because of the director's efforts, the atmosphere was very tense. And Yuan Meiyun, who played Ye Caiyun, Wang Yin, who played Wang Xitao, and Qin Tong, who played Ye's father, were all skilled performers, so there was a special success in the performance, which goes without saying.</p>

<p>— Written by Takuo Hoto, Translated by Guangzheng Zhang</p>
<p>The Suburban Life Urgently Needed by City Dwellers</p>
<p>The complexity of the city increases daily. People in noisy and bustling places rush about to pursue their goals, constantly striving with various tools of civilization. Vehicles stir up dust, and the smell of kerosene fills the streets; the smoke emitted by various factories covers the sky and the earth. Modern urban life is in such a state. In this kind of noisy sound, foul odor, and intense red glow, it is impossible to rest from the day's fatigue. From a health perspective, urban life is extremely bad. Conversely, the air is fresh, the lush green is captivating, the trees sprout tender yellow buds in spring and wear beautiful red leaves in autumn, and the scenery changes with the seasons; at the same time, one can listen to the delicate and melodious songs of birds in a gentle environment. Such suburban life is abundant.</p>
<p>If we do not only think about profit and desire but broaden our horizons to see the interesting natural beauty, then suburban life is a very meaningful thing. In short, for people who want to develop interests and improve their health, the suburbs are the best place to go. So, what are the characteristics of houses built in the suburbs, especially for middle-class families? Of course, just as ten people together have different appearances, everyone has different perspectives on houses. And people are accustomed to having dissatisfaction with their own things. Therefore, objectively examining the superior characteristics of suburban houses is a very interesting and painstaking task. Now, briefly speaking from the facts, there are approximately the following points.</p>
<p>Harmony Between the House and its Surroundings</p>
<p>1. Light: What distinguishes the suburbs from the city is the ability to fully capture light. Modern European architectural structures pay close attention to this point. Glass can be used that allows ultraviolet rays to pass through, so you can bathe in the grace of the sun. That is to say, the currently popular sunbathing can already be done indoors. In short, good lighting must be considered when building.</p>
<p>2. Scenery: The suburbs have suitable conditions for enjoying the scenery to your heart's content. In the city, except for special environments, it is almost impossible to see far. This characteristic can be said to be enjoyed only by those who have lived in the suburbs. Accordingly, skillfully considering the arrangement of the house's position can receive extremely beautiful scenery. The joy of seeing the graceful posture of high mountains through a small window is difficult to describe. Closer views, such as forests and fields, are also very nostalgic scenes. As such, the body and mind fatigued from urban life can get full rest.</p>
<p>3. Ventilation: Open on all sides, with plenty of space. In summer, if planned properly, cool breezes will often come leisurely, which can eliminate a lot of heat. In countries where south winds often blow in summer, ventilation from south to north can better enjoy the benefits of suburban life.</p>
<p>4. House Form: Living in the city, there are few opportunities to look around. But in the suburbs, because the fields are open, it is good to look near and far. In this kind of situation, the form of the house must be paid considerable attention. Especially for the distant view, the surrounding forests must be considered. At the same time, research must also be done on the harmony of color and the environment. Among the interlaced old trees, the shadow reflects a corner of the red wall; in the dense trees, the white wall appears faintly, which will give people a very beautiful feeling.</p>
<p>However, how can the kind of environment described above be created? What is the appropriate way to handle the surrounding garden? Indeed, the environment is not easy to create. First of all, when selecting land before starting construction, you should draw your ideal house in your mind, so that you can choose the appropriate place.</p>
<p>In the suburbs, there are many gentle slopes, winding streams, rocks, forests, and other natural gifts. If they can be used appropriately and cleverly, a house that people praise incessantly can be created. Generally, it is slightly higher, convenient for water, with good drainage, and sufficient sunlight. There must be lush forests above, and the view will naturally be suitable.</p>
<p>Using these naturally given materials to arrange the garden according to the terrain is the most appropriate thing to do. Accordingly, not only will daily life get great comfort, but visiting friends will also be very happy. This kind of facility cannot be done by human power alone.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Matters to Pay Attention to in the Design of People's Theaters <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongchao Liu</p>
<p>Drama and film inherently have the mission of imparting knowledge and assisting education. Therefore, in culturally developed countries, there are countless theaters. In our country, except for a few major cities, the cities with theater facilities are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. If there are any, they are just simple straw mats and wooden frames with simple equipment. The theaters in big cities are mostly magnificent and beautiful, and the huge construction costs and expensive ticket prices cannot be popularized among the public. Therefore, all parts of our country need the establishment of people's theaters.</p>
<p>The construction of people's theaters must pay attention to both drama and film. So that the invested funds will not be stagnant. The structure of the building must be strong, because inland theaters often collapse due to carelessness, resulting in tragedies. Therefore, it is best to use steel-reinforced concrete or T-shaped steel to make it durable and fire-resistant. Although the cost is high, it is also a safe solution for once and for all. The support of the theater's floor should not be done with large beams or very long cantilevers that cross the theater, as is often the case in Shanghai's grand theaters. This method is particularly dangerous. It should still be supported by pillars. Although the audience may have the regret of "eating the pillars," it only takes up a dozen seats. As for equipment and decoration, there is no need for air conditioning, hot water radiators, in-wall electric lights, spring chairs, patterned doorposts, carved ceilings, silk velvet curtains, carpets, etc. Just keep it simple and clean.</p>
<p>Too many seats will inevitably waste capital, and too few will hinder future development. It is best to have between 1,000 and 1,300, distributed on two levels, with the ratio of about three above and seven below. The distribution of one floor or three floors is not correct in terms of sight lines, so it cannot be used. The volume of the theater must be such that each seat has a space of one or two cubic feet. Ventilation equipment must use exhaust fans and indirect air vents. The number of windows must be reduced to avoid disturbing the sight lines. The number of doors must be one for every 120 people, with a minimum width of four feet. The position of the doors must be scattered on all sides and not concentrated in one place.</p>
<p>The seats downstairs must be arranged in an oval shape. The widest point should not exceed 35 seats, and each seat should be 15 inches wide. The number of rows should not exceed 30. The distance between each row should be at least two and a half feet. If the seats in the Rongguang Cinema are about 60 or 70 rows, the viewers at the very back seem to be too straining their eyes, which is not appropriate. It is best to have four aisles, each wide enough for two people to walk side by side. This road must be a few inches lower than the ground, so that the guests coming and going will not obstruct the sight of the audience. (This method has not been seen in Shanghai theaters.)</p>
<p>The structure of the floor must allow the sight lines of the rear rows downstairs to reach the top of the screen, and the rows upstairs to reach the edge of the stage, without being blocked by the heads of the people in the front rows. If the floor is too close to the stage, the slope will be steep, and the feet of the audience in the rear rows will often bump into the heads of the audience in the front rows, which is very annoying. If it is far from the stage, the rear rows of the floor seats will be too far from the stage, otherwise the floor seats must also be reduced. Therefore, the position of the floor and the two corridors must have an appropriate distance, height, and slope. This is closely related to the area and height of the theater. The projection room should not be too far or too high from the screen. It is best to protrude into the middle of the floor seats, so that the light is clearer and the angle with the screen is more accurate. The above are just superficial points, but they are also what should be paid attention to when designing a people's theater.</p>
<h3 id="e167">On the Crisis of Highly Developed Architecture <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Ouyang Gu</p>
<p>Chinese culture is one of the earliest in the world. Even in terms of architectural art alone, it has influenced foreigners. However, if someone talks about the history of Chinese architecture, it is pitiful to shake their head and say: nothing. Until recently, not only have I not seen a single special book, but even the term "Chinese architectural history" seems impossible to establish. Countries like Japan and Korea have directly or indirectly received Chinese architecture in the past, so their temples and houses have an oriental color. After the Middle Ages, foreign forces and influences transformed all the inherent art in architecture, overturning all the original old buildings. At the same time, the capitals also felt the increase in population and the development of commerce. In the fixed and limited land, there was a shortage of application. Therefore, the potential for upward development has become a necessity.</p>
<p>Although high-rise development is indeed the best way to solve the problem of densely populated cities, the so-called "occupying the sky but not the land" does not hinder anything. But the facts are not so. We can understand by looking at the survey below:</p>
<p>Last year, the New York Health Bureau investigated 1,062 offices in commercial areas, with a total of 5,833 office workers. Among them, 79% of the offices were located in extremely high buildings. The indoor air and light were poor, and lights had to be turned on even during the day, resulting in reduced physiological functions, pale complexion, weak eyesight, and weight loss. It can be seen that the impact on health is extremely great.</p>
<p>For this reason, the United Kingdom and the United States have clear regulations to divide regions and absolutely restrict the upward development of houses. Some use the width of the road as the standard. Japan has geological reasons, so tall buildings are rare, fearing that earthquakes would cause even greater harm. The tall buildings of apartments and banks in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession must occupy at least a quarter of the land, and the light shining on the opposite roof must also form an angle of 56 degrees to avoid affecting the neighboring houses. In addition, Chicago, the city with the highest building restrictions in the world, is above 260 feet, but it must not exceed two and a half times the width of the road in front. Ordinary residential buildings, especially the Shikumen alleys in the Public Concession of this city, are not even allowed to build three floors. It can be seen that the defense is precise, so the reduction of all kinds of dangers is naturally expected. If high-rise buildings are used instead, elevators must be used up and down. If there is a fire, the danger will be even more unspeakable.</p>
