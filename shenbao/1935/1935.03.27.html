<h3>裁減轉口兩稅問題</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>邇來財政部有裁撤轉口稅分別减免出口稅之計畫。已提經中政會通過。（見孔財長與中央社記者談話）此固爲吾人所渴望而亦最切要而最賢明之舉措也。蓋對外貿易無辦法。旣不能减少入超之逆勢。自不能杜貨幣之不外洩。而在國際商業劇烈競爭之下。人方以管理貿易。貶抑幣值。建築關稅壁壘。以絕外貨之輸入。促自國產品之輸出。而吾則猶是轉口有稅。出口有稅。障得重重。以阻出口貿易之發展。安得不一敗塗地。增加貿易入超之數字。本年美商會年會中。巴沙嘗謂「中政府向不顧念出口商。對於商人增進中國出口貿易之企圖。輒以捐稅並增加出口稅以困之。雖出口貿易之發達。可使若干萬華人獲得職業。且可使新資本流入中國。然中國不以鼓動此舉爲務」云。而今我政府已能注意及此。寧不爲我工商業欣然色喜耶。</p>
<p>出口徵稅。原爲財政之收益起見。早年尚有復進口稅及內地子口稅兩種。甫於民二十年一月起停止徵收。而現行之出口稅則。凡視爲向在出口貨中佔重要位置而今則逐漸式微。以及新興工業品有待保育者。亦未嘗不予以免稅輸出之利。求之稅則中。共約三十八種。爲列於後。表中所列之數字。卽出口稅則中之列號也。</p>
<p>四六喬　麥四八高粱　四九玉蜀黍　五〇小米</p>
<p>五一米穀　五三小麥　五四未列名雜糧　二三紅茶</p>
<p>一二三磚茶　一二四緣茶　一二五茶末　一二六毛茶</p>
<p>一二七花燻茶　一二八茶片　一二九梗　一三〇未列名茶</p>
<p>一八〇同宮絲　一八一白絲　一八二灰絲　一八三黃絲</p>
<p>一八四廢絲　一八六絲綿　一九二棉線襪　一九六抽紗品等</p>
<p>一九七花邊　一九九究絲紗綫　二〇四綢緞　二〇五爾綢</p>
<p>一二二絲製衣着　二一七外幣　二五〇書籍　二五一圖畫</p>
<p>二五二各種刊物　二五四草帽等　二五七包裝容器　二六二髮網</p>
<p>二六四傘　二六六漆器</p>
<p>據最近消息。轉口稅之裁撤。似已勢在必行。籌補辦法。亦已擬就。正在審核中。至出口稅如何減免。內容尚未揭布。竊以爲年來出口稅在關稅收入中之地位。以出口衰退。逐漸低落。自二十年之四千七百萬元。浸降至二千三四百萬元。迄未有回復之象。前去兩年。竟未及進口稅額百分之十。觀下表卽可知其概况矣。（單位國幣千元）</p>
<p>進口稅　出口稅　轉口稅</p>
<p>二十年　三一四、六八六　四七、八三一　一五、六四六</p>
<p>二十一年　二三六、二九一　二六、七七七　二〇、五五二</p>
<p>二十二年　二六五、六一一　二三、二四五　一八、〇〇三</p>
<p>二十三年　二六一、〇二一　二四、七〇〇　一六、九〇〇</p>
<p>旣出口稅爲對外輸出之障碍。而其爲值在整個稅收中。又甚微渺。卽使盡行裁廢。雖於財政上少一筆收入。而於國家財富上安知不增加許多。若以兩者完全裁撤。一時籌補維艱。則凡爲現在出口貨物中佔重要地位之商品。除爲本國所必需。或爲本國之特產外。概應予以免稅。若蛋品年來輸出大减。豆及豆餅。在輸出商品中已無地位可言。桐油棉花。亦見减退。凡此若不急籌補救。其失敗自可立待。茲據國際貿易導報（七卷三號）所載民國二十三年出口商品數值之百分比。（對是年出口總值之百分比）列其順序如下。以見出口貨之大勢。</p>
<p>（一）　茶六·七四　（二）棉紗　五·八五　（三）五金玉·七四</p>
<p>（四）蛋品　五·六五　（五）皮貨　五·四四（六）絲經　五·三一</p>
<p>（七）桐油　四·九〇　（八）綢緞　三·六四（　九）棉花二·八四</p>
<p>（十）猪鬃　二·八三　（十一）羊毛　二·四三　（十二）花生二·三一</p>
<p>（十三）藥材　一·八九　（十四）烟草　一·七六（十五）棉布　一·六四</p>
<p>（十六）其他　四一·〇三</p>
<p>表中除（一）（六）（八）三項業已免稅外。餘如棉紗·棉布·粗細夏布·蛋及其製品·花生仁·熟皮·皮貨·毛鬃·桐油·茶油·棉花·烟草·乾鮮製菜·藥材·香料·以及各色毯子·地毯·地蓆之類。至今猶　徵稅。其他各品之有待於减免者。自亦不少。現財政當局旣在審議之中。必能早日實施。以慰工商界喁喁之望。至進口稅自應同時增加。以資抵補。（若稅率增加在一成之數。已可抵補盡免出口轉口諸稅所損。）如是出口稅廢。進口稅增。而工商界又能努力改進。以求本身事業之發展。經濟恐慌或有來蘇之望乎。</p>

<h3>英德賡續談話　希特勒闡明立場　反對東歐中歐公約　重返國聯附有條件　昨日談話集中軍備問題</h3>
<p>（柏林）法國向國聯申訴德國重整軍備一事、如能滿意處置、則德國有復返國聯之可能、德國視其陸海軍之數額、仍有在某種情由下談判以定之、聞此爲希特勒今日直接答復英外相西門掌　大臣艾登問談所發者、據消息靈通方面聲稱、希特勒今日曾詳細釋明德外交政策之某某數點、尤其爲對東歐與瑙河公約之反對、希氏並切實聲明德國志在和平、而願合作以緩靖歐洲、惟關於德國重整軍備與其强迫軍役計畫問題、未多涉及云、明晨十時將續作談話、屆時將暢談德國陸海軍數額與德國復返國聯之可能問題、在西門離此之前、不致有驚人之宣佈、柏林人士皆覺其他各國今當需勞力工作、而後任何大問題之最後解决始克宣佈云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>昨晨集議情形</p>
<p>（柏林）英德兩國當軸今晨十時三十分續開會議、以軍備問題爲討論之主要點、英方仍以外相西門掌璽大臣艾登爲代表、駐柏林英大使費浦士亦與會、西門昨日勞碌後今日狀已安適、德方代表亦仍爲希特勒、助以外長牛賴特與軍縮專使田賓特羅浦將軍、</p>
<p>軍備為主要話題</p>
<p>（柏林）英德談話至午後一點二十分、暫時停止、英德兩國閣員、齊赴英國大使館午宴、希特勒總理亦親自參加、宴畢仍繼續談話、據本社特派員所得消息、本日談話當涉及陸海空軍各項問題、英國方面消息靈通者、已將希特勒總理之主張、作一歸納、謂各國如一律完全解除軍備、則德國亦依樣辦理、倘有一國不允裁軍、則德國必須儘量擴充軍備、德國陸軍定爲三十六師、乃係各國共同分配某礎、其幹部名額、則未</p>
<p>德方取兩重攻勢</p>
<p>關於軍備問題、德國將視他國之行動如何、而後決定其自己方案之任何限制、向英代表建議德國外交政策之大要、與其建設性之提案、應由希特勒併合成一書面之備忘錄」、衆信希特勒對軍備問題之主張、爲如各國皆實行軍縮、則德國亦願步其後塵、如一國開始擴大軍備、則德國亦將效其所爲、關於海軍問題、聞希氏曾聲明德國重整海軍之備至廣大之程度、無論如何必需數年之功云、英人方面預料德國欲以軍備競爭之責任、諉諸英國談判者、故於本日談話中採取兩重攻勢、計分三種步驟、其規模基大、卽（一）希特勒並不堅持海軍重整軍備之要求、所謂海軍四十萬噸、並非確定數字、（二）希特勒堅决贊成天空公約、藉以證明德國空軍有與最大空軍國相等之理由、（三）空軍旣可對等、則海陸軍自當依照辦理、至於德國所提議訂結保障公約一事、英國高級人員中認爲含有重大危險、蓋此種保障制度、可使德國若干鄰國避免侵略、而其他鄰國或將受其累也、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>對俄軍備不讓步</p>
<p>聞今晨談及蘇俄軍備情形後、希氏聲明苟非俄國允諾、（一）將其西疆軍力之主要部分調至遠東、（二）減低其軍額、則德國於軍備不能作大讓步、</p>
<p>談話進行欠平順</p>
<p>談話將於午後四時賡續進行、聞今晨之談話、遠不如昨日之平順、希特勒對於軍備問題、似未提出特殊建議、</p>
<p>今日討論將依或下列之方針進行、</p>
<p>（一）東歐公約　德國不願加入現式之該公約、或願照波蘭德國協約之辦法締結若干區域協約</p>
<p>（二）米美爾　德國可與立陶宛締結互不侵略協約，惟立陶宛關於德少數民族、須恪守米美爾條例</p>
<p>（三）國聯　如法國對國聯提出反對德國重整軍備之訴案、能滿意解决、則德國願返國聯、</p>
<p>（四）軍備　德國陸海空軍之數額、可在倫敦談判之、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>對東歐約提對案</p>
<p>（柏林）今晨英德兩國代表談話時、德國方面拒絕訂結東歐互助公約、並提出對案、主張由領土毘連各國訂結互不侵犯公約、復由其他各國訂結保障公約、英國閣員以德國此種對案、有自相矛盾含糊不明之處、頗爲詫異、聞已要求希特勒元首以書面說明其概要、（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英嚴防消息外洩</p>
<p>聞今晨之集議專討論軍備與軍縮問題、西門與艾登出會塲時、面呈嚴肅之色、午宴後、二人留署若干時與費大使深談、英代表現嚴事戒防、以杜談話消息之外洩、德警務人員亦作嚴密戒備、以保護英貴賓、聚宴時有警察一隊準備聽調、並有便衣偵探雜於民衆中、</p>
<p>艾登準備赴俄京</p>
<p>西門謂會議終止後、擬接見外報代表、同時艾登已束裝準備於午夜首途赴莫斯科、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>米美爾法庭判案增強希特勒手腕</p>
<p>談話開始未久、卽接立陶宛京城柯夫諾來電、謂被控陰謀推翻國家將米美爾交還德國之國社黨員一百二十六人、經立陶宛當局審訊後、均處以重刑、判處死刑者四人、終身苦役者二人、餘處徒刑八年至十二年不等、諸人財產均被沒收、此電所傳之消息、或將影響米美爾問題之解决也、米美爾法庭之判案、眾視為足以強　希特勒對米美爾問題之手腕、衆料米美爾之審判案、將引起柏林之公憤、而向主陶家嚴厲要求减刑、希特勒在會議中接此消息後、卽停止討論、而向英代表陳述米美爾問題、歷時頗久、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>威廉街民眾麕集狂呼德元首萬歲</p>
<p>午後一時二十分、卽由英外長西門在英大使署開宴欵待國社黨諸領袖、維時有民衆千餘人集於威廉街、以俟西門艾登之抵、戈林將軍衣天藍色鑲金邊之空軍大將制服先抵、衆皆揮手狂呼「萬歲一以迎之、無何希特勒亦至、羣衆歡呼益烈、希氏行國社黨敬禮以答之、西門接踵至時亦受熱烈之歡迎、與宴者共五十人、國防軍領袖佛里志將軍亦在其列、席上女子僅費浦士夫人一人、聚宴處乃在大使署金碧輝煌之跳舞室、希特勒入席時狀殊疲憊、（路透電）</p>
<p>德願和平合作</p>
<p>（柏林）關於英德兩國談話情形、據聞希特勒總理曾向英國閣員說明、德國甚願以平等權利及集體安全制度爲基礎、立卽訂立限制軍備之公約、</p>
<p>視蘇聯為大敵</p>
<p>對於在擬議中之西歐天空公約亦準備予以簽訂、惟任何安全制度由蘇聯參加者、則德國皆表示反對、</p>
<p>奧應有自決權</p>
<p>至於多瑙河公約計畫、（中歐洲各國互不干涉內政之公約）則凡維持德奧兩國間現狀之任何制度、　德國皆所反對、德國將堅持奥國人民　在政治方面有自决之權、（指德奧合併問題）</p>
<p>重返國聯條件</p>
<p>又聞希特勒總理贊成德國重返國聯會、惟以改組國聯、使盟約與凡爾塞和約脫離關係、而同時完全承認德國平等權利爲條件、</p>

<p>（日內瓦）國　對法國中訴德國破壞凡爾賽和約事、今日已開始行動、俾此事得由國際最高和平機關處理、凡屬國聯行政院之國家、今日已接得秘書長愛文諾之通知、於四月十五日召開特別會議、國聯高級方面預料、如以此項問題正式表决、則行政院或將斥責德　、惟現在已竭力設法避免此舉、同時國聯已另　困難問題、因據美聯社自可靠方面得悉、奧國亦已發動要求恢復徵兵制、而設置常備軍隊十萬人、聞奧國已向英法意三國表示、謂如不將聖日耳曼條約之軍事條欵修改、奧國將不能再維持其地位云、意國對此當然贊成、因此舉可增加抵禦德國在南歐擴張之力量、小協商國則反對此議、蓋恐此舉將引起匈牙利及保加利亞要求同等待遇也、消息靈通方面則謂、奧國要求增軍、實與哈布斯堡皇室復辟運動大有關係、此間得悉、奧國內衛軍現正醞釀政變、而以其少年頒袖史泰亨堡親王爲奧國執政、惟此項計畫大概將取和平方法、由修改憲法入手、俟史泰亨堡親王執政之後、則去沃都大公卽位當更近矣、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>布達佩斯　匈牙副總理貢博斯昨日在選區集會演說、謂德國對於重整軍備問題、要求已多年、惟以他國對之不置可否、遂出於自决之途徑、以達平等之目的、匈牙利爲國聯會員國之一、卽擬向之要求平等權利、且意大利及各友邦亦願爲之助、則其所求者定可達到目的、政治問題之外、匈牙利更擬提出財政經濟問題、各國担負歐洲安寗之重任、亦應予以提携也云、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>意國增兵奧邊　奧整軍備不欲反對　認為抗德南進壁壘</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）共和黨參議員波拉爲胡佛總統時代外交委員會主席、今日以其向來簡短爽利之語調宣稱、「予並不以爲有戰爭之危險、德國自能爲所欲爲、協約國亦自將屈伏、凡爾賽和約雖將成爲廢紙、然此亦大佳事也」云、此言一出、於是歐洲之戰雲立時消散矣、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）歐戰時英國郵船「魯西丹尼亞」號、被德國潛艇轟沉、致使美國乘客多人罹難、威爾遜總統遂因此事向德國宣戰、頃美國政府鑒於歐洲各國若果開釁、則此種情事、不難再度發生、因而美國或致再度牽入漩渦、亦未可知、現方考慮在戰時停發旅客出國護照、以資防範、並研究禁止軍用品出口辦法、但一般人對於禁止軍用品出口之舉能否實行、表示懷疑、以爲棉麥兩項在現代戰爭中、確可認爲軍用品、倘若禁止出口、則美國農民勢必激烈反對云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）國聯秘書長愛文諾今日在此發表一文、言及日本自明日起與國聯脫離關係事、謂日本爲國聯最初會員、與國聯合作約十五年、竟與國聯脫離、極可抱腕、今脫離已成事實、所有日本與國聯間之法律上關係、不復存在、日本對于國聯不復享何權利、亦不復負何義務、故不幸日本不復保持其前所有關于國聯之地位、惟吾人聞日政府擬以二年前日皇諭旨之精神進行國際合作之政策、此種意旨、使人欣幸、吾人不能言日本將採何種形式、但就余個人而言、余已决定不作可妨害日本與國聯關係之舉動、吾人不能預測將來、余不，以爲吾人應放棄國聯普遍化之希望云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日退出國聯之預吿期間、以今日吿終、從明日起、日與國聯斷絕關係、據東報所載、日對退盟後之方策及態度如左、（一）國聯仍取不承認「滿洲國」、故决不復歸國聯、（二）委任統制之南洋羣島、因受任國不一定須聯盟國、故决不歸還、而僅提出統治年報、（三）軍縮會議、因其目的在促進世界和平、主减輕國民之負擔、如美俄亦參加、故日亦參加、（四）世界法庭及國際勞工局、因其性質與國聯獨立而存、故日方仍參加協力、（五）鴉片諮問委員會、婦孺孩童買賣委員會、交通總會、經濟諮問委員會、財政委員會、保健委員會租稅委員等各機關、因聯盟指派委員不公正、故日决不以政府資格參加之、（二十六日華聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）日本之脫離國聯應於二十七日午前零時發生效力、在名實上均須實現、曾於中日糾紛之際、最後在國聯理事會以日本全權主席之任務、行使縱橫活躍、復於昭和八年二月二十四日聲明脫離國聯之松岡洋右氏、對此感慨甚深、茲據其發表談話如下、通吿在脫離國聯今日發生効力、亦不過完成脫離國聯之形式而已、世界各國早知日本在兩年前脫離國聯、且曾於發出通吿之際、已由日皇賜以詔書、此項詔書之精神、卽可謂爲日本國民全體之胸襟、但雖云正式脫離、而爲世界和平計、仍須與各國協力、並無仍何變更、會內會外完全同樣、日本决不能在世界上處於孤立地位、而世界各國亦不致使日本處於孤立、蓋在此小範圍之世界以內、當無此項舉動之可能也、余以爲日本脫離以後之國聯、僅爲歐洲之和平機關、深望其能發揮機能、世界各國至少以今日之國聯不能認爲尚屬全世界之和平機關、因其未能達到使命、故均爲之覺醒也、保障世界和平之道、當以分別地域、而行使分工合作爲宜、首應保障區域上之和平、講求斯道、開設區域上之會議、以便疏通意見、捨此不圖、另無善策、總之、日本之脫離國聯、或係命運有關、結局對於關係各國惟有講求最善之道耳云云、（二十六日日聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）議會會期竟未延長、米穀關係之法案卒被擱置、山崎農相對此頗爲憤慨、昨夜語記者曰、會期未延長者、由於政府認爲無此必要、然農林省則極威困難、農村政策因此無法遂行、卽受世間之非難、亦非得已、善後方法不能簡單言之、惟此僅農相、應由全內閣負責、（二十六日電通社電）</p>

<p>安敦玉廣原荒漠、一望無涯、孟浩然詩「野曠天低樹」之句、不啻爲此間寫照、迨入嘉略關、則景象全非矣、</p>
<p>酒泉南山、爲祁連最高峯、終年積雪不消、俗有天山之稱、夏季紅日高照、積雪消融、灌溉田地、利若水渠、故有終年不雨亦可豐收之諺、但據友人劉曉泉談、「民國十七八年、甘陝大旱、飢民掘草根、剝樹皮、與皮革共熬、勉以果腹、富者購食饃饃、恐爲飢民搶奪、輙涕唾其上、不自嫌髒、餓殍無人掩埋、乞丐抬遊商舖、不給食物、則停尸不去、賣女　子、初有受主、後無顧者、蓋初買人子女者、後來亦求自賣而不得、種種慘狀、不忍罄述、酒泉同屬災區、自亦不能例外、」然則無雨豐收之說、實乃形容過甚、近年雨水稍好、問諸農民、則所答異口同聲、仍不外一「旱」字、某農民且謂、「我們在大饑荒時、曾自誓若幸得不死、以後縱討吃化吃、每日也要少吃一口、預先貯下些食糧、以防再災、誰知近年以來、老天也不大賞雨、依然述喝小米粥都難喝上、旁的不說、請你看看這冷的天氣、我們還穿這一身、何况還有……談話至此、卽截然中斷、窺其意似苦「旱」之外還苦「捐稅」、故欲解除農民痛苦、積極的須修治水利、消極的尚須取消苛捐、二者均極切要、且不僅一縣如此也、</p>

<p>信譽卓著　無可竊議者也、在篤信放賬制度之舊商人、對於進貨時、有人以商業承兌匯票請其簽字承兌之際、或竟認爲有損信譽、有碍體面、蓋中國商業之習慣、篤重口頭信義、不特任何賬欵、均須年底清結、甚至平時送貨收貨、並回單而無之、在昔商業情形簡單時、自無問題、而近代之商業日臻繁複、尤非個人之交割、而爲公司團體之往來、且金融狀態、異常錯綜繁密、則運用票據之需要、亦日益急切、故進貨若干、約期付欵、爲極通常之商業信用、如能到期付欵、則非特不損體面、抑且信譽卓著、例如在三四十年前、工商界之以自己的貨物、向人押欵者、每視爲恥辱、有損牌面、故極秘密行之、而目前則以瞭解商業經濟之原理、以自己所有的貨物、向人押欵者、實爲信用可靠、故押欵已成爲商業上經濟運用之普通行爲、故余信商業承兌匯票推行後、必可逐漸亦成習慣無疑、蓋此項商業承兌匯票、並可</p>
<p>輾轉貼現　例如甲以貨售與乙、出票由乙簽字承兌、甲即可持票向A銀行貼現、A銀行並可向B銀行重貼現、而乙收到甲之貨物、轉售於丙、亦得出票、由丙簽字承兌、乙即可持票向銀行貼現、俾自己所承兌之貨欵、到期而照兌無誤、如此輾轉貼現、則僅一轉手之間、呆貨已立變爲資金、同時各方之賬面債權、亦僅一轉手之間、而盡變爲票據債權、在經濟上之運用活潑孰甚、是以凡與敝廠用商業承兌匯票交易之客戶、以三年之經騐、今已知其便利、樂於推行、而不願再沿用舊式之放賬制度、此爲明證、或謂、承兌匯票、似以推行於本地爲宜、而不宜於外埠、但敝廠推行承兌匯票、非特本外埠皆已推行、而外埠用承兌匯票交易之客戶、亦從未有所誤事也、現在上海市綢緞業同業公會·暨上海市電機絲織廠業同業公會·正在極力推行、而國貨產銷合作協會、亦在勸告各產銷者、一律推行、且中國·交通·國貨·上海·綢業·及新華·等銀行、亦已表示對於此項承兌匯票、可以收受貼現、聲勢益壯、則推行尤易、故尤希望各業</p>
<p>一致提倡　第一步、先打破一年一結之放賬制度的舊觀念、瞭解推行承兌匯票後、可以使金融籌碼增加、（即同時以呆滯之賬面、即可運用爲流動之資金、）以賬面債權、變爲票據債權、在票據法上、更有確切之保障、則自皆樂於推行、惟初創之時、不免有種種之困難、但以努力邁進之結果、必可全國實行、但事屬初創、一業一家之實施、困難目多、尤賴各埠各業之同業公會、一致起而開會決議、共同實行、則更易爲力、現在上海綢業同業公會及電機絲織廠業同業公會、已議決自四月一日起實行、則尤望本外埠之各大公司商店、協力提倡、一致推行、俾承兌不致發生任何問題、則不特上海對各埠可以推行無阻、而他埠對他埠、並可繼起推行、於是全國工商之貨物、隨時可用票據的方式、貼用現金、金融流轉無滯、事業　進不已、自屬可操式券者也</p>

<h3>金城銀行二十三年份營業報告（十三）</h3>
<p>本年之內匯行市、變化亦極劇烈、昔者因貿易關係、各地銀元價格、向高於滬洋、　之民國十九年上海津匯爲一〇〇六·九元、靑滙一〇〇四·四元、漢匯一〇〇七·六元、二十年以後、農村衰落、農產品出口减少、國內貿易之差、不得不以現銀　付、滬　價漲、故民國二十二年上海內滙之全年平均數、津滙落至一〇〇一·四元、漢匯落至一〇〇一·三元、靑酒則爲一〇〇〇元、本年一月至九月間、此種趨勢未變、且現銀流滬較多、匯市因而跌落甚鉅、平滙津匯、七月間曾落至九九八元、靑匯亦曾落至九九九元、漢匯尚能維持千元數角上下、不過十月以後、瀕海口各埠之匯價暴漲、如平匯津匯、本年十一月二十六日、皆升至一〇一七元、靑島及烟台十一月二十八日亦高至一〇一四元、而漢匯則仍在一〇〇二元上下、蚌埠長沙等內地匯價之變化亦少、　沿　各埠、因運輸之便利、於徵銀稅後、走私甚多、　底稀薄、向上海求匯、及由上海寄匯者、皆有增加、故匯價日趨上漲、</p>
<p>本年外匯、受美國白銀政策、及各國匯兌傾銷之影響、一致放長、銀出口徵稅後、方稍受限制、年初尚覺平庸、二月放長甚劇、以美日爲最甚、六月以後、銀價逐漸抬高、各匯亦一致上升、十月十三日、而至最高峯、國幣百元、可兌英金七·五磅、日幣一三臨風元、美幣三七元、與民國二十年九月之匯價相較、美匯長百分之四三、英匯長百分之六七、日匯竟長百分之二一〇、銀出口徵稅後、我國銀價與世界銀價、失所聯繫、而較世界銀價爲低、各匯乃一致收縮、美滙至三十二元、英滙至一先令三便士、日滙至一一〇日元、唯十一月以後、趨勢仍感疲軟、</p>
<p>至於金融業本身、於　　中、亦有進展營　業方向、頗多新　、唯　替變　、亦頗激烈、去年度銀錢業新成立者十六家、復業者三家、分支行之增設者四十九處、倒閉者上海十二家、他如　波南京天津蘇州安慶揚州等地之銀錢號倒閉亦時有所聞、際茲經濟衰敝時期、稍一不愼、即有失敗之虞、政府對金融之設施、則有取締國外匯兌之投機、儲蓄銀行法之施行、標金之改按關金計算、白銀出口稅之徵收、外匯平市會之設立、　大端、皆爲切要之圖、唯世界經濟與國內經濟、息息相關、處今日國際經濟勢力支配之地位、應如何外察世界經濟大勢、內審我國情形、在不蒙受損失之條件下、妥爲應付、是吾人所企望者也、（二）物價本年中國物價各地皆急驟下跌、如以本年之平均批發物價、與去年之平均物價相較、上海凡跌落百分之七、華北跌落百分之九、南京則跌落百分之十二、以工業而為之分類上海物價有如下表、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （汪嘯麟）</p>
<p>西洋人進食用刀叉，國人吃飯用圓筷　刀叉象徵侵略，筷可象徵圓滑，中外人的個性之不同，在這小小的「吃」的姿勢上，也可看出。</p>
<p>用花鳥等字眼形容女人。說是男性侮辱女性。但一般新興女作家過去曾經，而且現在繼續在探用這種字眼描寫女人。這，該算是什麽呢？是女性侮辱女性嗎！？</p>
<p>天下雨，地濕了；他愛伊，她墮落了。此中奧妙，只要你腦子一轉，便能理會。</p>
<p>目下妓女生涯一落千丈，而從良做人姨太太的喜劇，也「久已未聞」，在另一方面，女學生的姦案層見疊出，新女子降身爲變相姨太太的把戲、，也一幕幕的在我們眼前展開。哈！滑稽的對照。</p>
<h3>遊無名英雄墓</h3>
<p>— 一心</p>
<p>從沒有下過雪的冬天裏溜了過來，很快的，世界又佈置成一幅靑葱的可愛的圖畫。</p>
<p>太陽是這樣暖和地照着，風是這樣爽神地拂着；的確，春是太神秘了，正像一位美麗的少女，隨時散放着誘人的魔力。</p>
<p>再也忍耐不住了，上罷課，忙拍去了襟袖上的粉筆灰，拉了老胡，用着爽快的步調，走出了校門。</p>
<p>走着，走着，穿過綠色的原野，聽著潺潺的水聲，最後我們停住在一塊佈成壕形的荒塚上；從被雨水衝刷成祇剩了　一些墨痕的木板上，發現了、這便是我們忠勇的將士埋骨之所。</p>
<p>「四年了」我這樣想著，「可憐壯士為國而流出的熱血，在人們的心目中，已變成一杯紅色的葡萄酒」。</p>
<p>我們徘徊在這被人遺忘了的無主的荒塚上，送了夕陽歸去，四處的炊烟，織成了一幅戰時的烟幕，想起了四年前的今。正是我們忠勇的戰士，利用著這天然的掩護，衝殺敵人，不竟有些淒灰</p>
<p>踏着暮色歸來，春的，少女般的誘惑，在我的腦海裏，已換了一幕戰爭的回憶。</p>
<h3>明少爺</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>明少爺，是我的老鄰居，是我在小學裏念書時的同學。</p>
<p>他的爸是很有錢的，他又是獨生子，所以在小時候，他的生活，不只是我們鄰居的孩子們都十分羨慕，在同學之中，也沒一個不羨慕他。不錯，他老是穿着美麗的衣服，吃着可口的糖果，玩着高貴的玩具。</p>
<p>他在十八歲上，就娶妻了。他的妻又是那麽的美麗。</p>
<p>他娶了妻，便不念書了·也不做生意，整天的聽戲，打牌。厭了，到外面去玩女人。</p>
<p>在他二十歲上，他爸死了。隔了不上一年，他媽也死了。於是他更舒服了，錢是隨意的花着，沒人可以干涉他。</p>
<p>在一年之中，把上海的股票存欵，濫嫖濫賭。從第二年起，開始出賣鄕間的田產。在第三年上，向親友借貸着過活。第四年是無法維持了，變賣着傢具衣服。他的老婆，便在這一年上，和他脫離了夫婦關係。</p>
<p>從此，明少爺便剩了孑然一身。偕　是借不到了。昔日的知交密友，是誰都不和他招呼了。暑天赤着膊，冬天穿着一件討來的破棉襖，有時還坐　階沿上，對着太陽捉虱子。</p>
<p>去年一年，沒見過他的面，滿以爲他是不在人世了。却不道這一回在老閘橋上，又瞧見他來給我拉車兒。</p>
<p>瞧他的神氣，怕的還沾染上了毒物的嗜好了呢。</p>
<h3>大都會怪物岀現</h3>
<p>— 江敉</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回　夜話凄凉生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺人</p>
<p>浣花道；瞎！不要提起，所以我想到社會上的女子，脚跟站不穩，是很可怕的。這位小姐，父親由前淸就到西安來了，聽說是個老官僚。這位小姐，是最小的一個，當然很疼愛，讓他讀書。可是不作官多年了，在西安遇過圍城八個月的大難，接上又是兩年大旱災，家境也就窮得很可以。本打算回安徽原　去，可是多年不通消息，不知已經怎麽樣。而且這裏還有破屋可住，第一就省下一筆房錢。這裏生活程度是兩樣，過東方人的生活，比東方還要高。因爲東西是由潼關外來的。過本地人生活，每日吃些鍋塊，喝點米湯，甚至於油鹽都可以省了，一家人幾塊錢就可以混一個月。因爲如此，所以他們遲疑了沒有走。到了後來，索興要走也走不動，因爲川資籌不出來了。這姑娘呢，還是往下念書。可是，摩登害了他了。這兩年，交通便利了，東方的人，紛紛的向這裏來，時裝的女子，常常可以在街上碰到。小姑娘們，那個不愛好看，也就跟着東方來的女人學。可是這就不容易了，一雙皮鞋，由上海運到鄭州，由鄭州運到潼關，由潼關再運到西安，恐怕就要七八塊錢一雙，平常的人家，七八塊錢，可以過一個月，誰肯買這樣貴東西，給小姑娘們去穿，他們愛上了摩登，總是要學的。家裏弄不到錢，就到外面去找，這小西天就是他們第一個找錢的地方，賈多才道：原來如此。可是這不是報名投考的事，他們是怎樣入門的呢？浣花道：這又是交壞朋友的壞處了。譬如都是窮姑娘，誰也穿不起綢裙子，光皮鞋。可是其中有一兩個突然的摩登起來，手表也有了，綢衣服也有了，絲襪子也有了。（一六七）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>祇有一件東西，可算是遊戲於實用之中。就是當那些春蠶快要吐絲的當　，揀取一兩條放在，張糊在茶杯口上的薄紙上，讓它們把原是要用以結繭子的絲，一起吐在這紙上，於是就把這滿佈着蠶絲的薄紙剪成整圓形或長圓形，用絨布做墊子，取來作爲粉撲，或搽抹香油，倒確然是最細軟爽滑的。我至今還在每次撲粉的時候想到它。</p>
<p>雖然太后本人是只把蠶當做一種玩意兒，但那些給伊雇用來照管育蠶的女孩子們，却因受了那許多傳統的迷信觀念的影饗，還是非常鄭重地從事着的。伊們好像是一羣熱心于宗敎的聖女，而蠶就是伊們心目中的神聖。</p>
<p>第二十五章　各業藝工</p>
<p>在宮裏頭，可說是自成一個社會。不但有專管育蠶的女孩子，還有其他各業的藝工咧！這些藝工的技術當然都是很優良的，比起外面的普通工人來，相去自不可以道里計了。太后也深信他們是不可多得的高手，往往引爲很得意。而且伊自已對於這幾種細巧的工業也極感興趣，不時要走去看看：恰巧我也是一人，最愛參觀人家做些精細生活的，——雖然我自已是一些都做不來的——於是太后便每次必帶我同去，去了之後，還要像看到了什麽新奇的戲文似的，依戀着不肯就走。（二七八）</p>
<h3>兩腳申報</h3>
<p>— 顯微生</p>
<p>市上刋行的報紙，何北數十種，內容如何，姑且不論，但所難能可貴者，不論××報」，「××報」，人家都混在一起呌做申報，好似申報是一切報紙的通稱，不是他資格頂老，那會這樣入人之深，我常聞得人家說：「你今天看過申報麽」「今天申報上有沒有什麼消息」「謝謝你，送幾張申報我，讓我包包東西」等等是。</p>
<p>我說的兩脚申報，那是我鄕的特殊名稱，要够上這個資格，倒也不很容易，多分是一班無事卅里的仁兄們，飽食終日，東逛逛，西走走因此，耳聞目擊，比人家特別來得多，得不到什麽新聞則已，偶得了一些新聞，就喜歡東吿訴，西傳佈，屑屑瑣瑣，甚或西街狗相打，東街倒翻餛飩擔，也是他們資料之一，那班人在實際講起來，雖可說得絲毫沒有什麽價值，但消息靈通的頭銜，實當之無愧，進一步說起來，人家怎麼不說兩脚××報，偏要說兩脚申報，不是申報消息的敏捷，別有勝常之處，又那得如此。</p>
<h3>碗泥粉</h3>
<p>— （寗自强）</p>
<p>景德鎮的瓷器，是最出名的，雖然不能遠駕歐美，可是在國中要算首屈一指的了！</p>
<p>大凡一種物件，製造成功，技藝一半，原料一半，苟有技藝，而無材料，則無所施其技，苟有原料，而沒有技藝，則無所用其材，相得益彰，相需益切，在人類是如此，在物類也何嘗不如此！</p>
<p>就像景德鎭瓷器的原料，原出在安徽祁門，即俗稱碗泥粉的便是；惟其有這精細的原料，乃能造成精美的陶器，飲水思源，又豈可忘其所以呢。</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>書畫與裝潢（上）</h3>
<p>— 吟秋</p>
<p>我國書畫，爲才人墨士精靈之所寄，賴楮素以傳世；惟楮素性柔，必經裝潢，庶便展玩，而易保存。何也？書畫家興到之時，拈毫濡墨，任意揮灑，一幅旣成，付之裝池，則神采墨妙，躍然生動，必視未裝時爲出色。故靡論寸楮尺素，成須講求裝潢，一　西畫之必須配置畫架也。</p>
<p>江浙裱工，夙負美譽，在昔競推湯强二氏，今雖不乏名手，而能參用古法者，十無二三，珍藏家與鑒賞家咸優禮焉！因同一書畫，裝裱精美，則錦上添花；反之，則佛頭着糞；或有前代傑作，名家珍品，傳壓旣久，殘脫剝落，而須重行改裝者，則必非庸工所能爲矣。昔人以書畫改裝，比之疾病求醫，洵不誣也！</p>
<p>改裝書畫，必先審視紙絹之氣色，如色黯氣沉，須使浣淋，紙質絹素，完好無損者，須揭净後，徐徐浣洗，以去塵汚。若黴損有病者，則須連托紙同洗，善加調護，亦有枇杷核錘浸滾水，冲洗重汚者，惟洗後必用消水淋之，否則難免斑漬也。</p>
<p>揭裱非易事，揭絹尚可，揭紙實難，紙薄而糊重，或用白芨爲糊者，俱須審慎。書畫破損，必用原絹補之，補時對紙之厚薄，絹之粗細，務使無異，即紙紋絲縷，亦未可少忽也。　揭裱之件，必用飛襯，其法即於襯邊時，四圍空去二三分，今謂之「出座」，俾裁瓖用糊之時，可於原心無傷。古舊書書而有殘缺時，可用陳墨，略加接筆，其名曰「全」，惟必求藝術高妙者全之，可使毫髮無憾耳。</p>
<p>裝潢種類甚多，現時最通行者，不外續裱絹裱紙裱等數種。其式有全綾半綾邊綾等，絹錦如之，或鑲，或嵌，或挖，其價值之高下，視工料之省費而定。卷軸昔時多用紙殼裝沙，取其重垂，惟易斷毀，故今已少，均用木桿代之，最好取質重而豐實者，檀香為上，老杉次之，杉取性燥，檀可辟蟲也。</p>
<p>軸之兩頭平者，說曰平軸，裝以軸頭者，則又有紅木軸頭牛角軸頭等，牙及柴檀，用者亦多，間有裝以磁軸者，質脆易碎，不若用白竹雕者，反爲文雅可取耳。玉軸多用於手卷，其裝亦平，而卷首綴以牙　，蓋舊制也。</p>
<p>裝裱之格式，必求其美，上下鑲嵌之尺度，左右邊緣之寬窄，尤須配置得宜，或狹而長，或寬而闊，務使與書畫本身相稱，或懸掛之地位相當，未可一槪論也。惟忌用「詩堂」，精究裝潢之人，無一用「詩堂」者，即小幅亦不宜用，用之便俗，俗不可醫，今人多喜「詩堂」，殊不可解！</p>

<h3>蔣百里發表　對於一十宣言之感想　續</h3>
<p>陶希聖先生在遊伙研究裏、指出了兩種不同的團體、我見了歡喜的了不得、這是歷史上的大發明、</p>
<p>而我以爲就是這一點是三千年來民族衰敗的致命傷、項羽的士挨團體旣失敗、而韓信死、張良辱逃、蕭何、自此以後活動份子與智識分子不絕的暗鬥（莽換之纂與歷代的文字獄）智識分子之內又每形成兩派自相殘殺、（歷代的黨爭）一民族中的最重要的細胞、始終在晤門的狀態下、因此養成了智識階級的兩件不可救藥的痼疾、一·就是不負責任（讀書人的最理想是宰相不是皇帝）二·就是不切事實、（自禮樂射御書數的六藝而改爲詩書禮樂易象春秋的六經是一大關鍵）譬如釀酒酵素壞了、　如爆炸、電管濕了、舉天下之良法美意無上妙品、一一須經過這一道腐敗幽門、而後能入於中國社會、百藥罔效之總因、　非在此</p>
<p>歷史上也曾發見幾次沉痛的呼聲、如淸初顧亭林之提倡樸學、就是對於不切事實的反抗、但這種運動、因爲活動分子與智識分子暗鬥之結果、事實派的顏元李剛主、終歸失敗、而變相的成爲考據、考據派的精神果然是科學的、但實際上還是幾句死話、太平天國時代、胡文忠的包攬把持、曾文正的挺經第一章、就是對於不負責任的反抗、但僅僅能做到一部分的成功、而從暗鬥出身之李鴻章、仍爲這不負責任不切事實的大潮流所打倒、以演成今日刻骨傷心的外交局面、活動分子的性格、就是根本與智識分子相反、他的長處是肯負責任、但是結果流爲武斷、能切事實、但是結果流爲投機、武斷則不能集衆人之長、投機則不能定久長之計劃、這兩件事於近代式國家發展是不相宜的、秦漢以後、政權武力智識分裂了、</p>
<p>（從前集中於貴族階級）所以政治上有不斷的競爭。而華族就漸趨於衰弱、但是我華族在這種壓迫之下、（竭力奮鬥繼續了三千年）還做一件驚人的大事、就是對於物的工作（我還有一篇專章題目是華族與物質）就其奮鬥的精神言、仍乎蒸氣機關的發明、未必算這麼一回大事、從造紙·印刷·陶磁·漆·建築·雕刻·乃至水車、機織、件件有獨到的發明、不過為智識階級所瞧不起、故不能有文字的記載、而學術的積聚性不能發揚罷了、近五十年來、社會受環境之影響、發生了大變化、但其政治的演進可以分作幾步說、第一步、是智識與武力的合作、（（一）智識分子投身為軍人、（二）軍人入學取得智識、（三）社會中智識分子與活動分子的合作）這中間的聚散成敗、有事實的證明、不必詳述、第二步、當然是政權·武力·智識的一致、但應當切實注意者、就是智識分子還是不能切實的統制物質、所以民族的生活上根本發生了問題、而其所以不能統制物質的原因、也仍是因不負責任不切事實的兩大弱點而來、</p>
<p>從顧顏的樸學精神、曾胡的負責態度、或許可以在酵素雷管中、加入一點新生命罷、但是新式的社會、更有一樣要素名曰「組織」的、這組織兩字的意義、就是說一件事、不是一個人、一個機關負責任、而是各最小單位（個人）各負各的特別責任、而運用上得到一種互助的成功、這就是新經濟的要點、也就是國防的元素、我們現在可以說有强兵而國不富者唉、未有富國而兵不强者也、</p>
<p>說一句牢騷的話、商店的學生、工匠的藝徒、要是夜間能讀上一點鐘的書、（就是在實際的事物中過生活的人而能攫取智識）恐怕倒可以負起復興民族的責任、而每天坐汽車包車、在中小學上六時以上的功踝的、還不過是一種附屬品、而書本上的科學家、只好讓爲禮敎所束縛的、爲農業宗法精神所統制的華僑、每年匯欵回來替他養老罷了、</p>
<p>最後、蔣氏並以極豐富的感情、說出下面幾句話、他說近諸位宣言、譬如古寺深山鐘聲回響、其代表此時寂寞凄凉之感耶、仰將爲黎明之先導也云云、是晚直至談深夜方散云、（完）</p>

<h3>糧食　粉麥市況稍分榮辱</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、大致平穩、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近小四分、遠好一二角左右、坎拿大小四分左右、洋麥報價上落旣微、惟以北路客帮、略有交易、又因本月份交割在邇、而現粉仍加五分、故一部分頗有收貨之意、遠期以廠方未出、亦呈定局、迨至下午開盤、初見略軟、旋則業外客戶、因迷信洋麥加稅之風聲、遠期買氣稍　、市面亦見挺勢、後來局面、如無意外變化、當難過昂也、結果本月份好二釐半、四月份好半分、五月份好七釐半、六月份好半分、七月份好七釐半、八月份好一分二釐半云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、大致呈冷寂盤旋之象、業內外買賣、均多觀望、賣戶方面、行家及內地稱、一致未套、故市況更見沉寂、迨至下午開盤、以粉市穩定、普市場有洋麥加稅之謠、人心遂見活動、買戶亦稍興奮、但須事實明瞭後、脚地方能固定也、結果本月份好二分、七八月份好四分、現麥市面、因廠　尙活、客戶扳售、髙貨喊髙二三分、中次不動、開山東麥三元六角九分、次六角六分、蚌埠麥三元六角六分、計一千包、由福新辦去云、</p>

<h3>北幫略動辦粳米　—市面終爲天雨遜色—</h3>
<p>粳米昨日各帮來源、與前相仿、共到二十三四號（貨共四千餘石）、本街銷塲、以雨阻　　、客路包　、則以輪運有便、稍動　、計天津威海衛兩帮共辦有一千二三百包、但結果終　非正色胃口、對於吃盤問題、　　苛刻、致無　大局、市態猶呈垂軟之色、其各晚稻價與各厚粳等同見貶修數分也、餘外若杜尖及陰變元等、則悉現平疲耳、滬北米市河下各路來源十餘艘、市上各貨去胃、因天宮陰雨、各店上市無幾、致胃納淸淡、市價各貨均小近角譜、</p>
<p>黃豆市況平庸、人心散漫、交易不暢、廠胃祇立德油廠辦去歸德荳四百餘包、價為三元七角、其餘去路推本街爲最、昨辦去漢口乍荳七百餘包、價自三元四角七至三元三角、又沙市荳三百餘包、價爲三元四角四至四角、及牛莊白眉荳七十五包、價爲四元一角二、內地去安東荳四百包、價爲四元八角、泉州帮採漢口乍荳三百餘包、價爲三元五角二、寗波帮取去乍荳一百餘包、價爲三元五角、刻下荳市、惟漢口高乍荳因貨稀而市穩、其餘仍疲軟之形耳、</p>
<p>洋米市况依然堅定、照目下存底充實與來源不絕而論、市面終不易上展、惟近日市上盛傳洋米加稅、一部份囤戶已不亟亟求脫、昨日內地去西貢轉淡、但九江幫突起暢辦、胃口甚濃、辦去西貢小絞各米五千多包、南京幫續有問津、本街內地亦有應酬、全市開出現洋米近萬包、期貨二百五十噸、客秈由内地辦去八百包、行情均與前市相似、</p>

<h3>南北貨　泉桂圓新苗有歉象</h3>
<p>泉州桂圓、近日到貨不多、査前日福東輪進口僅來四百餘箱、因地頭有外帮採辦、泉價又升二三元、據貨客函訊、均須加價、且聞現在桂圓新苗僅及去年一二成之譜、故意思頗高、無如此間銷路迄未旺動、行家進胃不貪、趨勢反呈軟象、致無成交、</p>
<h3>油市　柏油市面漲跌靡定</h3>
<p>柏油銷塲、春季極關重要、因燭淘家夏作開製、所用之貨、自非最髙品不可、即皂廠所用低貨、亦在此時採辦、所以春季銷路之旺、本駕冬令之上、近年來自製皂用　、泰半改用牛油椰子油等進口貨品、國產製皂原料之柏油、反棄之如遺、其原因係柏油價髙、皂廠家擇廉而用、亦當然之理也、然則柏油之賴於走化者、厥惟製燭淘家而已、不料自上冬起、牛油椰子油價亦漲至每擔二十元以外、與柏油不相上下、故自去冬迄今、各皂廠亦將有採辦柏油者、因是今春柏油價格與去春相較、每擔須加起六七元光景、但其致漲之因、並不全在皂用之旺、而上年因卒災、各省產拍區城年令大欠、關係甚大、年令旣欠、用塲又旺、自應漲風迭見、詎知浙省　荒遍地、燭淘用度、大减特减、浙省　塲之久、有更甚於年令、因此市面雖漲、依然供過於求、上週漢市麻城油突漲一兩、而浙油仍售原價、蓋浙油全賴向蘇省頃銷、否則存積將至如何擁擠、近日漢麻　復由十五兩回跌至十四兩四錢、　花一現、爲時　暫、本埠行家現無木重荊公議爲每擔二十四元、然恐未必依據公槃而售、乃習慣使然耳、</p>

<h3>「風雅遺音」</h3>
<p>— 白苧</p>
<p>宋林正大（敬之）風雅遺音一卷，淸刻本，去年在舊書肆裏買到，好像彊村叢書中沒收羅進去，這是一卷很別緻的詞集，其中全以古人詩賦文章隱括爲詞，作者在序裏這樣說着：「世嘗以陶靖節之歸去來，杜工部之醉時歌，李謪仙之將進酒，蘇長公之赤壁賦，歐陽公之醉翁記，類凡十數，被之聲歌，按合宮羽……而酒酣耳熱，往往歌與聽者交倦，故前輩爲之隱括，稍入腔律，如歸去來之爲哨遍，聽穎師琴爲水調歌，醉翁記爲瑞鶴仙，掠其語意，易繁而簡，便於諷吟，不惟可以燕寓懽情，亦足以想象昔賢之髙致，余酷愛之，每輒效顰而忘其醜也……」云云。</p>
<p>這集子裏，隱括了許多古人的詩文，如杜甫，韓愈，李白，歐陽修，茫仲淹等人的作品共三十餘篇，我們隨便舉出他一首來看看，這是隱括蘭亭記的，調寄賀新凉。</p>
<p>「蘭亭當日事。有崇山茂林修竹，羣賢畢至。湍激淸流相映帶，旁引曲觴流水。但暢叙幽情而已。一詠一觴眞足樂，厭管絃絲竹紛塵耳。春正暮，共修禊。惠風和暢新天氣。騁髙懷仰觀宇宙，俯察品類。俯仰之間因所寄，放浪形骸之外。曾不知老之將至。感慨舊游成陳跡，念人生行樂都能幾？後視今，猶昔爾。」</p>
<p>技巧的確還不錯，可是我們除了看到作者這麼「巧妙地」把原作用另一種形式表現出來以外，所得到的還有什麽？王羲之的情感决非他的情感，王羲之個人的社會環境和蘭亭修禊時的自然環境也與他全不相干，他只是把那「紙面上的」原作搬到另一張「紙面上」罷了。旣不與原作者有由衷的共鳴，又不能給原作灌注以新的生命，目的只是在「付諸管絃」而已。這正如花瓶中的絹花，噴水池中的人工泉水，全是假的。</p>
<p>但「始作俑者」並不是林正大，過去蘇軾的哨遍就是人所共知的例子，黄庭堅把醉翁亭記括爲「環滁皆山也。望之蔚然深秀，瑯琊山也……」那首瑞鶴仙也很有名。此外如南宋的蔣捷在他竹山詞中一也有隱括杜詩的一首賀新郎，開頭是：「絕代幽人獨。掩芳姿深居何處，觀雲深谷。自說關中良家子，零落聊依草木…」依然沒有脫去前人的窠臼。南來遺民劉尙友的養吾齋詞中沁園春一首亦是隱括了前赤壁賦的，那起調的句子是：「壬戍之秋，七月旣望，蘇子泛舟……」這種風氣到援來是愈來愈普遍流行了。</p>
<p>對於這種隱括的方法，援人毁譽不齊，就我所知，沈雄的柳塘詞話中有這樣一段：「東京士人隱括東坡洞仙歌爲玉樓春，以記摩訶池上之事，見張仲素本事記。魯直隱括子同漁父詞爲鷓鴣天，以記西塞山前之勝，見山谷詞。是眞簡而文矣。」可是反對的也不乏其人，如賀裳的皺水軒詞筌裏說：「東坡隱括歸去來詞，山谷隱括醉翁亭，皆墮惡趣，天下事爲名人所壞者，正自不少。」劉體仁在他七頌堂詞繹中也說云隱括體不可作也，不獨醉翁如嚼　，卽子瞻改琴詩琵琶字不見，畢竟是全首說夢。」這正可說明一些人的意見。實在說，這種體裁最不易用，如果你不能給原作灌注以新的生命的話，則比聯句和　還易「墮入惡趣」，我不反對借固有的材料來再度表現，只不要「侷促轅不」，毫無推陳出新之處，因爲如果那樣的話，我們有原作一篇已經够了。</p>
<p>像這類「風雅遺音」，只是那時士大夫「燕寓歡情」的消閑東西而已。</p>
<h3>閔行行（一）</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>被人想着許會有的卷寒，終於沒有來，三月的氣息，使人放棄是不是已經春天的愚問。很妙的驚蟄的這一個節令名稱，不僅運用到冬眠的蟲豸上是適當的，人類這動物，大概也脫不出這驚的範圍吧。固然人向不注意驚蟄，但却過上已，自把上已改定在格歷的三月三日，其時間更近了。這一個節令，倒是很可提倡的，因這已是可以旅行去的時季。今年，這天剛好是星期日，天氣又那末好，無待注意到這是個佳節，人也會想出去走走，我就在一天去了　行。</p>
<p>雖然曾走過不少地方，而對於住了經十年的上海的鄰境，却異常生疎，閔行也就是未到過的一處。或者這是並不足奇怪的，在江灣，有幾十歲的老人，竟從未到過上海，那末上海人對於那無足注意的閔行，未去過的當更多吧。我的選定到閔行去，也沒有什麽理由，大概只因爲牠位在黄浦江邊，坐船去就可看到黃浦上游的兩岸風景。旅行的趣味，在旅途上的恐怕比在目的地的還要多些。水上又比陸上更好。當我遲滯在一個地方太久的時候，我常去坐一次短程的渡船，以獲取一點旅行意味。香港深水埠間，漢口徐家柵間的渡船，都是我曾經留戀過的。我也這樣往來於上海髙橋間過，那渡船上的乘客，純然是當作游覽的怕也很多吧。我時常幻想，倘若能有一個水上旅館，每夜從熱閙的都市駛開，航行適當的水程，到次早再轉回都市，當有很多人願以這旅館爲家的。上海怕就有住在閔行，而每天坐船來往的人吧。</p>
<p>去年那酷熱的夏天，市輪渡開着游浦特班的時候，也另有去閔行的特班，是不是同機關辦的，我當時沒有注意，後來却誤記爲是一起，這次去閔行之先，竟先去銅人碼頭間航行時間。　航上的人告訴我去　家渡。到董家渡只見上南輪渡，再問，說要去開橋。要細問那人却煩躁地說，一去了自然知道，船就要開，快去。」來不及叫車拉去，却是兼攏閔行的平湖班，因爲也正約一刻鐘後就開，决意就搭牠去。在當時總還以爲另有輪渡的，直到後來到了閔行，才知道以前想錯了。</p>
<p>踏上船，內河輪船上慣有的小販，立刻使人起旅途之感。船沒按鐘點開，這不能怪船公司，大概旅客根本就歡喜不緊不慢，就算他肯按鐘點到碼頭，那末爭論車價，招呼行李，從最貼身的衣袋裏　錢買票，同送客的謙讓上不上船，再慢條斯理地踱上船，船能不等一回嗎。同艙裏像我一樣地僅是玩玩去的人看來並不多，而大家的態度都比我更悠然，大概就因爲他們更富於中國風度。最特色的是後艙的幾個客人或船家了，船一開，馬上拖開桌子打起馬將來。他們的馬將開始，我們　裏的坐位逐漸寬綽，因爲有些躺下的人放棄地盤，犧甡腿力去立着看和了。</p>
<h3>長路</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>自己最愛的是旅行。</p>
<p>也許是正因爲旅行機會之少而更喜歡着它。人總是在心底憧憬着一些自己所沒有經騐過或經騐得很少的事物的，「新鮮」吸住人們的心。</p>
<p>可是我愛的並不一定是靑山綠水和異地風光，更使我髙興的是用作長途旅行的工具：舟車之類的東西。</p>
<p>當踏上車廂或是跳板的時候，自己捫撫得出心是在跳躍，於是即使不是春天，自己臉上也會掛起春天的笑來了。</p>
<p>一月來，每星期總有三天要在傍晚跳上電車作一個來回近二十里地的征途。電車有和火車類似的地方，那長長的車廂，那上車下車地方的踏板和扶手，所差的只是司機者脚下的鈴聲代替了汽筒的長鳴而已。</p>
<p>但這　—也有它自己的風趣的。</p>
<p>當耳朶裏振　着　　的　，眼睛瞅着在快被黑暗罩住的街市時，張着眼的夢開始了。好像自己是縮在長途火車的車廂的一個角落裏，隨着車輪的碾動，自己在荒凉的山野　馳，並且是望不見一顆燈火，包着的是黑暗，觸着的是黑暗。於是帶來了一串猜想。</p>
<p>揣摸着那未知的地土和陌生的人們。如果不盡爲的是玩，一個新的希望就更　長在心底了：拋下了舊的，開始一個新的行程呢。</p>
<p>在電車裏我却更耽於猜度了。</p>
<p>這趟長途車特別價廉，自宣武門到崇文門，人多是不用說，但如果不是自沿路熱閙站上車，依然不會擁得沒處坐的。</p>
<p>因爲自己是按着時間趕車，於是便也會巧起來逢着一些熱客：按着時間下班下學的職員與學生，大家熟稔地點點頭，却不想交換話語。</p>
<p>每次是有那麽多的陌生的臉：穿着制服的軍警，拖包挾袋的女人，在電車裏還悠閒得捻核桃的老者，送貨的徒弟，甚至去趕夜塲戲的三等優伶……</p>
<p>你用耳朶聽：</p>
<p>今天發了幾塊錢餉，幾點鐘×城發生了搶案，（於是再把捕盜的經過描叙一番，引得鄰坐們都挿話。）女人們碰到女人們便曉舌起來，問一問「貴幹」，問一問兒孫，說不定便來一句帶笑的奉承：</p>
<p>「好福氣！好福氣！」</p>
<p>那一個便扭動了癟嘴微笑了。</p>
<p>在掌中捻核桃的悠閒的老者却會和商人徒弟們問問行情，聽到物價又往上漲時便捋着鬍子：</p>
<p>「這還了得，人快沒命兒啦！」</p>
<p>上等優伶起碼有一輛包月車的，在這裏混着的大都只是唱頭二三齣的小將們。由他們的眼角眉梢和說話的神情可以斷定他們誰唱旦，誰唱花面……　　「明晚還得趕「中和」哪！」</p>
<p>「排定了什麼，你？」</p>
<p>「桑園會，今晚你是草橋關吧？」</p>
<p>唱慣了旦角，連平日言談神色都帶點女味了。</p>
<p>滿身油漬的肉店老板在靠在窗櫺上打盹嘴角上涎下口水來，這是他的安息吧。孩子們啾着他笑，一些大人們瞅着童子軍裝的碩健的孩子們也笑。孩子們在車裏還是不能安靜，走來走去，撞倒在人們身上。老女人們驚怯地瞅着他們單薄短俏的衣服：</p>
<p>「不冷麽，乖孩子？」</p>
<p>每站，換上幾個旅人。報販在車窗外叫賣着一大枚一張的小報或晚報，很僥倖的，才會接着從車裏仲出手來的銅子。</p>
<p>車一直開到盡頭，人們下來各奔自己的目的地，賣票員下來和站上的同僚們招手。</p>
<p>司機人又把車向後轉了。</p>
<h3>作為時代作家的任務</h3>
<p>— 梅君毅</p>
<p>中國文壇曾經有人說過：凡好像一片荒蕪底沙漠那般的寂寞：這兒沒有紫丁香底芬芳及百合花底苗條。這兒沒有婉轉的杜鵑歌聲及悲悽的蟬鳴。然而，也有人說過：中國的文壇好像一個嘈雜的市塲：有種種不同的玩藝兒。有「新時代的「前衛」有舊骸骨的「迷戀者。」總之萬花撩亂，彷彿五光十色的市集那樣樣各有各的貨色，手法，及其欺騙雇客的手段。</p>
<p>這都是不錯的。在質的方面來看：中國文壇的「出品」，其質料能够「耐用」，「美觀」，使人看得「上眼」的；簡直是鳳毛麟角。在量的方面呢，雖然「貨色」並不算少，擺得也够五花八門，但都是「冒牌貨」，「劣貨」，「陳貨」，「不合時宜的剩貨」。眞正能够適合於大衆口胃的東西確實很少。所以，這樣祗見雜而不精了。</p>
<p>也許，這就是中國社會現象的一種反映吧。在畸形的現象下必然有畸形的東西產生的。</p>
<p>然而，作爲時代作家的。他就必得看淸這些現象。看淸了自己的工作及任務，看淸了讀者大衆的要求，口胃，和需要。</p>
<p>在荒蕪雜陳的文壇裏，作爲時代作家的，他就應該下上番苦功，將野草除淸，垃圾掃蕩，用血心來培植出美麗茁壯的花果。這就是園丁的任務。所以英勇的奮鬥是必需的。虛心的學習是緊要的。努力的工作是應當的。一個時代文藝作家的創作，應該而且能够「反映時代」，「鼓舞時代」，「推進時代」，强有力地去表現人生的眞實的意義，强有力地去創造生活的新形式。</p>
<h3>戰爭雜記（十二）</h3>
<p>— 德永直作葉蔭譯</p>
<p>阿熊哥是個極端的戰爭否定論者。在那時候還殘留了一些些的疎稀鬍子，就是阿熊哥當兵時候的紀念。他是個中日戰爭和日俄戰爭都曾出征的勇士，一隻手和足部的創傷，就是在首山堡戰時受到的。</p>
<p>靑色銅葉章和一百多塊錢的獎金，變成了長遠在一塊生活的妻子和一隻手的代價；親屬很少的阿熊哥，就變成了無妻無子的廢人。</p>
<p>沈默寡言的阿熊哥，有一次曾對父親講過這樣的故事。</p>
<p>那是首山堡之戰的四五日前的事情。是在爲着援救前綫的，屬於同一團的三連兵士而徹宵行軍的時候。正當大衆沿着鐵路，穿過髙粱地前進着的當兒，就遠遠地聽到了不絕的槍聲。</p>
<p>一聽到那越近越激烈的槍聲，在大家的因爲四五日來的强迫行軍和食糧不足而弄得疲乏得像棉花般的頭腦裏，都感到恰似緊縮着般的緊張意味，不期然而然地覺得好像運自己的足音都在鼓膜上面響着。</p>
<p>『立定！』</p>
<p>連長用尖銳的聲音。當大家都覺得莫明其妙，停止下來的時候，在遙遠的前面的戰綫上，那似乎是在衝鋒的「哇」的喊聲，就突然蓋住了槍聲跟其他的聲音響了起來。</p>
<p>連長好像沈思了一些時：但，在派出了五名斥候之後，馬上又命令全隊「開步走」。</p>
<p>衝鋒的不知道是敵人還是同夥：但狀勢却似乎的確吿了一個段落，槍聲漸漸地衰微下去了。</p>
<p>一氣踏過髙梁地，就是髙低不平得很厲害的稍爲寬闊的原野：右邊可以看見鐵軌在寂寞地發亮，在那像是窪地的黝暗的對面，仍是高梁地在起伏着。</p>
<p>這時候，一種「哇哇」的許多人的喊聲，又從三百多米突的前面傳過來了。</p>
<p>「臥倒！」</p>
<p>連長馬上喊着這樣的口令；大家就作臥放的準備，等待着第二個命令。</p>
<p>「哇哇　……」</p>
<p>可是，這種音聲，一靠攏，就令人覺得實在奇怪。連長在這樣地思索：不用說，這並不是衝鋒；但，如是日本軍的話，那在退兵的時候，自然也沒有發出喊聲的必要。這時候，兩名斥候就跑回來向他報吿：</p>
<p>「前綫給敵人占去了。×　和×連好像是已被全滅的樣子……」</p>
<p>連長遠望着走近來的約莫一連人的黑影，似乎是下了决心一般地叫着「臥倒預備放」的口令；他自己也把指押刀握好，躺了下去。</p>
<p>從三百米突的地方漸漸地跑近來，走到二百米突的地方來了……但，速畏沒有發出第二個命令　　　　　在覺得可笑的，就是那種喊聲。在距離得遠的時候並不是那個樣子；但，一走近　，却實在　　　沒有神氣的　喊。</p>

<h3>俄青年團犯法行樂</h3>
<p>— 小民</p>
<p>廿三日路透電，俄莫斯科，有靑年一團，專以犯法爲務，並設一總會訓練孩童行竊伎倆，其首領三人，年皆在十八歲至二十歲之間，均經發覺處決，當審訊時，據諸人供稱，彼輩並非爲貧困而爲盜，特藉以「行樂」耳，近來當局，大舉淸除全國匪徒，僅列寗格勒一處，已拘獲匪徒四千，小竊二千，據這樣看來，俄國的小竊匪徒，也着實不少。</p>
<p>蘇俄是共產主義的國家，他們是公妻，公產，公養，公育，社會的經濟，完全集中央，個人無絲毫之積蓄，衣食住行，絕不發生問題，游戲行樂，自有公共塲所，別國的老百姓，正在呼號失業，據羅蘇人自誇，他們的工人，還有求過於供之勢，故做蘇俄的人民，大有日出而作，日入而息，道不拾遺，夜不閉戶之概，無懷氏之民歟，葛天氏之民歟，我雖沒有到過俄國，然而心向往之。</p>
<p>今觀以上所載新聞，殊出我人意料之外，靑年的「行樂」，大牴不外觀劇看電影，踢球，賭博，追逐異性等等，從沒有聽見以「行竊」爲「行樂」的工具，我國雖爲共產國家，但其人民，並不是三頭六臂，別具肺腑，亦恐與尋常歐亞　民相同，何以他們的「行樂」別出一調，墨翟見楚王，，問於王曰，人有舍其文軒，鄰有敞與而欲竊之、舍其錦肅，鄰有短褐而欲竊之，此爲何若人也？王曰是必有「竊疾」矣，這僅僅是墨子一種寓言，今不料竟有這樣一類人物，眞是奇怪得很。</p>
<p>可知俄國青年的行竄團，決不為「行樂」而「行竊」，不是為經濟的壓迫，便是為政力重壓所難堪，無可說，不能說，只可說是為「行樂」了，這是共產人民，實為共產政府逼迫不堪的現狀，已可概見，並且就列寗格勒一處，土匪和小竊已有六千名之多，則全國的土匪小竊，其總量亦可想而知矣。</p>
<p>俄國不但人民如此，而其政府，亦都是行竊手段，自九一八後，俄國利用。</p>
<h3>深淵之前</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>空閒的，灰白色的園道，曲折地伸展在枯萎的草灘上，正如一支思貧血女人的胳膊扔在暗黃的絨毯上面，是反襯得更其憔悴可憫了呵。那徘矮小黝綠的冬靑，是常年被囚於粗長的黑鐵鍊索裏面，只要有一支枝桿特別長了起來，或是伸出鐵鍊外面時，就會被利刃兇猛地截去，它們，永久生長在嚴肅的制裁中而消失了自由發展的機能，它們雖有着整齊的行列，但究竟它們是殘廢者，是爲着舖張這園林而生長着的點綴品，可是，在這一切草木都枯萎凋零了的冬季，還祇有冬靑能熬住季節風的摧殘，吐露若青蔥向榮之色。</p>
<p>「有忍耐性的植物呵！」走完了冬青和黑鐵鍊索的並行列，便悄悄地從納悶的胸膛裏噓出了一個含有同情之感的嘆息。天空是陰沉得要下雨的樣子，大塊的灰白色的雲迅疾地飄浮着。呵呵，自己的心境裏不亦像這麽個陰沉的天嗎，老擠着層層愁雲，鬱塞和苦悶盤据在靈感裏，似霧般的迷茫不易消散，儘痴呆呆的站在園道邊的那株刺柏下，有三四個孩子嘻嘻哈哈的帶跳帶奔的經過我面前，那麼活潑地，如白鴿飛撲在微風裏，這剎那的眼前的形象，如一支刺柏咽進了喉管，刺痛着。想到了自己已消逝了的童年，便悄然地湧溢起年華的惆悵。</p>
<p>移着懶慢的步子，越過暗黃的絨毯似的草地，來到了溪流的邊沿，溪水毫無牽戀地在自己愁情的目光下流過，—</p>
<p>年華嗎！年華如溪水流過，年華如波面的片片雲絮的影，參透了多少事物的明滅興　，那星辰，節序，身軀，戀愛，事業，綠卉和薔薇！澈悟了一切偶現的浮生。處於世紀末的靑年該是蟄伏的時期吧？否則，不甘苦悶和寂寞，便流於放浪不覊的生活裏去。好吧，水總是要流的，不流的死水就會發生穢臭和孑孓，。年輕的人兒；冬靑哪，在這冷酷的雰團裏，還祇有年輕人挨得了環境的煎迫，我望着溪流，我望着溪流裏自己的影子，說：「忍耐着呵！」</p>
<p>忍耐着呵，在厄境中忍耐着呵！祇須是每刹那的沉默，便是每個果熟的機會，意外的喜遇總要來的，一陣微風，一隻白鴿，一個輕倚的少婦，一切最微弱的搖撼，都會給予苦悶的人一種輕鬆的欣然之感。</p>
<p>一時的迷茫，我漠然感覺着自己是躺在深淵之前，溫若枯澀的夢——這夢是恍惚的，如漂渺於黝黯的深淵裏的浮萍，似乎每個時辰都只隨波逐流底地飄浮着，到東到西？完全失去了我自己的意志，然而，這確實並不是夢，而是眞實的境遇，這人世，這人生，深淵呵，夢呵。我徘徊於溪流之前，我覺得平穩的流水太無意義了，我想拾起一塊傳角向水面扔去，激濺一些水花，可是，那勇糾糾的園警不時向我注視，「這許是有犯條律的吧！」於是，我就失去了這種勇氣，而終於拖着迂慢的步子，仍沿着那冬靑和黑鐵鍊索的行列，蹩出園門，「有忍耐性的植物呵！」仍悄悄地從納悶的胸腔裏噓出一個嘆息。</p>
<h3>菜花黃</h3>
<p>— 穆</p>
<p>二月中旬，是莊稼人最閑散的時候田中荳麥，及一望無際的菜花，隨着一陣和風拂過，像黃金一樣的擁湧着。在這般風和日暖的天氣，大多的莊稼人，吃過了午飯，上茶館聊天去了。卽有幾個在山邊割　靑草來喂養家畜的，也時作時息，隨意唱着「姐呀，郎呀」的調情山歌，看羊的姐兒們也毫無着澀地和唱着。歌聲自朝至暮似乎沒有歇息的時候。</p>
<p>近山的燕莊，其實是因燕山而得名的；說是山，不過是一個比較高大一點的土阜而已。靑草滿地皆是，有十來頭羊在陽光底下徘徊，看羊的姐兒躺在山陰，和那割草的漢子打混，笑聲和歌聲被春風送到每一個角落里去。</p>
<p>山脚下一泓淸溪圍繞着半個燕莊，在將要出莊的地方，是王老太的家。她家媳婦穿着士布夾衫褲，蹲在河前洗尿布，彷彿不勝其懶似的幾條尿布半天沒有完工。突然屋里喊起她的名字來，她知道是孩子醒來要吃奶的時候了，放棄了手中的工作敏捷地奔回家去。婆婆王老太一臉不自然的地把孩子遞到她手里，嚕咕着進房誦佛去了。她哄着孩子吃奶，目光不由沿溪水望去：那地方是她和丈夫定情之處。她是對莊的看羊姐兒，爲了燕山靑草豐盛，她每天隔莊趕到這里來，那樣地和一個年輕漢子結識了，這一堆土阜就和她發生了密切關係。</p>
<p>是去年菜花黄的時節呵，他們結婚了。做親時候異常熱閙，兩村的親戚，鄰居粗野地閙房到夜半，做出各種他們在燕山調情時的舉動以博她的嬌笑。那情形彷彿延長了四五天。</p>
<p>不到三個月，她懷了孩子。丈夫在農忙的時候，總一次二次偸歸來瞧望。鄰舍們碰着，作爲取笑的話兒全莊宣揚，她一方面覺得害羞，另一方面有一種說不出的愉快。</p>
<p>春天不知不覺地送走了，而她的快樂日子也曇花一現地消滅了，酷毒的夏</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>天奪去了她的丈夫。昔日的親友都變成了仇敵，就是萬分痛愛她的婆婆也常白虎星白虎星的滿街咒了。一個死了丈夫的妻子，在鄉間是認爲不祥的人物的。</p>
<p>從此她擠到地獄里，她不敢出臥房一步，她怕無數像蛇舌一般的目光。但是不盡不實的閑話還是每天送進她的耳里來。有時她婆婆故意大聲和人家談天，白虎星的聲浪是那樣刺耳地，甚至說她不守婦道。於是，她唯一的希望是腹中這塊肉，飲泣吞聲生下一個男孩子來。</p>
<p>鄕間自然重男輕女的，生了個男孩，她此援被人重視。但是這不是她的希望，她希望孩子長大起來，她把愛丈夫的心完全灌在孩子身上……</p>
<p>但是第二個菜花時節來了，燕山的歌聲每天送來，她見了成對粉蝶在菜花間穿梭，懷中的孩子只知吃奶，睡覺，她往往呆住了私下流淚。這遙遠的希望不能塡補眼前的寥寂，未亡人的寥寂歲月呵！</p>
<h3>上北高峯</h3>
<p>— 白山</p>
<p>從岳王墳出來，在碧血丹心的石牌樓旁小飯店裏用了午飯。這都是遊湖指南告訴我們的，半日的遊程至此結束。</p>
<p>吃飽了肚子，很想鼓着勇氣跑上靈隱去，但是恐怕如指南上說的要不及上北高峯。從飯店裏擁出來的遊客都是我們同程的，公共汽車在岳王墳前停住的時候，爭先恐後的把車肚子塞得喘不氣來。車上吊手的皮帶不够分配，不過不必祖憂，卽使車身轉側顚簸，大家已像夾板似的，决不致有站不住的脚的危險</p>
<p>車行約十分鐘，抵靈隱寺。人羣從許多地攤中進寺，經過長長的石砌行人道，兩旁亦是發售念佛珠，香袋等的雜物攤。親愛的丈夫每都爲妻子購唸佛珠縣在胸前。這種不調和的影像，只要在日落時候，到白堤上去散步，掛了朝山進香的黄布袋的摩登女子觸目皆是：卽是我們一行三人，那種上軍事訓練的服裝，也不是寺裏在平常時候可以發見的人物。所以淡掃蛾眉的西子湖畔，建築起紅瓦洋裝的別墅來，大家以爲是應有的點綴了</p>
<p>我們的目的在爬山，亦購了三支爬山杖。進了宏大巍峨的大雄寳殿，那裏的香烟，使人幾乎墮入濃霧叢中，入羅漢堂，同樣使我們掛下眼淚來：雖然同伴中有問起濟公募木建寺時的那個井，大家忽忽地從左側上韜光去了。</p>
<p>沿石級前進，兩旁修竹萬千，並聞潺淤的流水聲，審視之，乃山泉自剖竹間消涓而下也。近韜光寺，發現無數的竹枝上，刊着××放生等字，這玩意兒至今還是個悶葫蘆。假如當時問諸掛黃布袋的老太太，一定有一番長長的來歷吿訴我們的；但是我們誰都不願意這樣做，在韜光寺前休息的時候，大家就作爲談話的資料，結果自然還是等於零。不過我暗想情下次有重遊的機會，這沒有答案的猜測還是可以鼓動我們的興趣的：而且少知道一點事未始不是做人的幸福，我個人是這般想。</p>
<p>上北高峯的途中，遇見了不少虔誠的茅山道士。他們都盤坐在路角，目不斜視，篤篤的敲着木魚，面前的竹篾中是進香人施佈的雙毫銅元，爲數甚是可觀，出家確是救濟失業的一個至上辦法。沿途多甘蔗攤，售價甚貴，但是他們爬了那未許多石級來求厚利，與不勞而獲的茅山道士比較起來，總覺得這些人太可憐了。然而坐了山轎修福的太太們，很多和那些小販討價還價來着，那模樣兒很像上海小菜塲上掂斤簸兩的情形。</p>
<p>抵北高峯，杭城附近盡收眼底；那邊靑綠色的玉帶，漁帆出沒其間者，錢塘江是也。相與對峙的是南髙峯。所惜沒有把指南簿帶來，否則某也某也指點着的時候，或者更有一番髙興。移時，紅日西沉，那錢塘江映成金光燦爛，彷彿數十萬條小金蛇從水底湧擁着，要是能在這裏歇宿一宵，觀日出，更有一番奇觀。</p>
<p>臨行時，大家「抽」了一支籤，我的是上上，，菩薩吿訴我前程萬里，好自爲之！</p>
<h3>獅江散絃</h3>
<p>— 丁蔚南</p>
<p>自己的生活是那樣的終年潦倒，一下子東，一下子西，像天空中的流雲一樣，爲了朋友的和親戚的，與乎家裏的，一趟二趟的亟催着，敎我趕快的動身，回到這作爲是我們的故鄕的故鄉來，雖然距我生長的土地，有三四十里之遙，然而總算是我的故鄉呵！</p>
<p>被像跳躍着的汽車，把我駝到我的獅江來了。幾年的契闊，在熟悉的輪廓裏，雖然有七八年之久，可是記憶究竟是會長刻在心頭，縱使有些變了形態，而不是可以辨得出的。不過從前的，當我還在孩提的時代，曾號稱過八省的通衢，就是當七八年前，我還未被生活拋上潦倒之途的那時，也還有很多的新興的暴發戶。狹窄的街衢，浮滿着人頭的蝟集。可是現在是變了另一種情調，像一架支起了它自己的一把骨頭的肺結核患者。</p>
<p>不能回鄉的難民，在街上白着眼睛，等着好的消息。</p>
<p>生意是十分淸淡，布疋店裏，老長的一日，很少有幾個人會跑進去，夥計們是閑得要死：可是店門開啦，總得要有生意才好，大家只得把兩隻手，伏在櫃台上，眼巴巴地望着街上走來走去的人。好多店裏都換了老闆，自然是經過好幾度的滄桑。有幾家老牌店舖，仗着往年賺來的資本，忍痛地支持到現在，徼倖沒有關門，可是元氣是大傷了，雖然他有很大的店面，不過這種帶有刧援餘灰的痛苦，是祇有啞子吃黄　而已！</p>
<p>眞是奇怪，可是一點也不奇怪，素來很出米的地方，現在也貴得要拾多元一石了，窮人眞是呌苦連天，很多的農民又不能回去種田，讓肥沃的良田。到荒蕪的境地。自己的這樣亂動，幾年來的造孽，加緊了農村的崩潰！</p>
<p>河下的船隻，也都沒有什麼生意了，從前河沿停泊的桅檣的林立，現在是那麽地的稀疏：聽說舟子很多都改了行了，因爲公路通進了內地。和尙洲上，蘆葦依然存在，對岸人家的房屋，現出了它支離碎的情調！泛泛的河水，在灘頭滾下茫茫，灰白的天空，像裹不住這裏的破落似的。</p>

<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3>業餘如何娛樂呢！</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我們現在有一個對於個人生活最有關係的問題，也是一個有關一般人生活的嚴重的問題，特來請敎你，想你定能給我們一個明確的指示吧。</p>
<p>我們都是在一家銀行裏服務，每星期六的下午和星期日是不辦事的。我們在平常工作很緊張之援，得了這一天半的　暇，當然都要去尋求娛樂去了。但是我們看見那些同事在休息的時候，不是看影戲，就是看牌，或者竟跳舞到深夜才回家，這種生活實在太不對了。雖然有些人是比較好一些，但是能够去找正當的娛樂以消遣這種休息日的人，還是很少。</p>
<p>我們覺得在過度疲勞的工作後，是很需要一種娛樂以調劑枯燥的生活。不過像別人一樣、看戲·跑狗·看牌的胡鬥，我們當然不肯這樣做、同時却又難找到我們所認爲適當的娛樂，所以到了休息日，我們只好坐在家裏，看看書，反覺終日無所事事，煩悶已極。</p>
<p>先生，像我們這種情形，在現在一定很多吧，我們覺得一定有許多靑年，因爲找到正當娛樂，而走到墮落的路上去，這是太危險了！</p>
<p>我們爲了自己，也爲了一般人，所以特寫這封信給先生，希望洗生指導我們如何去覓取正當的消遣，以恢復工作的疲勞。專上、敬請</p>
<p>撰安</p>
<p>聞養秋</p>
<p>魯殿臣仝上</p>
<p>程龍</p>
<p>編者按：聞魯程三君所提出的業餘娛樂問題，誠然是一個，對於一般人生活最有關係的嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>娛樂的目的，是在使我們心力疲勞之後，能得着一種安慰精神和舒暢心情的效用。因爲一個人一天到晚忙個不止，以致身心十分疲倦，精神不濟，而娛樂就能興奮我們的精神促進我們身體的健康，忘去我們工作上的疲勞：同時正當的娛樂，却更可免除志氣的消行沉，爲的墮落，而增加工作的效率以求，事業的進展。</p>
<p>娛樂的含義和效用，旣是這樣的大，但是什麽娛樂才算是正當的娛樂呢？我們可以看到上海是如此的奢華，環境是如此的惡劣，一般人所認爲的娛樂却是看牌，賽馬，跑狗，吸烟，飲洒，尋花問柳等等。這是我們的正當的娛樂嗎？不！這些東西不過是使我們耗費時間，消磨精神，浪費金錢，這種娛樂是在引誘我們走墮落的路上走去。在過去和目前，被它所引誘而墮落的靑年實在不知凡幾。</p>
<p>關於正當的娛樂，種種很多，現在特舉幾種很易實行的寫在下面，以供一般人的參考。</p>
<p>（一）運動——運動能使身體强健，精精，舒爽。但是也不限於在什麼大的運動塲，才可以實行運動。我們在早晨，可以在空氣新鮮的地方，做做早操，或在工作之後，在比較淸靜的地步散散步，或是找個地方打打球，這都是運動。</p>
<p>（二）音樂——它具有很大的魔力，它能使人心暢神怡，陶冶性情，音樂實在是調劑精神的最好的工具。在工餘之暇，隨便頑頑，誠有無限趣味在內。</p>
<p>（三）旅行——旅行更是一種了不得的娛樂。在旅途中，我們欣賞那大自然的美境，我們可以得着許多書本所沒有的知識。雖然長時間的時期的旅行，不能辦到，但休息的時候，能約幾個朋友”到附近鄉村裏去跑跑，也是一件好事。</p>
<p>（四）看戲——有人說，看戲是不正當的娛樂。我却不敢贊同這種說法。我認爲內容腐敗，或不正當的戲，雖不値得去看，但那表演優美，有感化能力的，題材正確的戲，却不妨去看看。因爲它能陶冶身心，調劑精神，並且可以給你許多經騐和知識。</p>
<p>此外如閱讀書報，攝影，象棋，狩獵，等等都是很有趣味的正當娛樂，爲了篇幅所限，不能細讀了。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望這般人能改革過去不良的習慣，避免過去無聊的行爲，而去選擇一二正當的娛樂，以求完美的生活。至於你的經濟環境許可你做那一種娛樂，則須要你自己决定了。</p>

<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午十一時至十二時</p>
<p>開篇「春愁曲」</p>
<p>斜陽入院峭寒生。空寂繡房寳鴨溫。惜別思春春　照。侵尋夢影够消魂。懨　病起梳妝懶。中酒扶頭瘦不禁。想到昨夜燈花纔報喜。但是佳期淺淡不分明。可喜鸚哥意重吟詩澀。但是燕子心痴訴恨頻。早已是廿四番風花寄信。只是游絲亂絮閣紗　。曾記得自在簾鈎書館靜。棠唸送過打棋聲。曾記得十三鈿柱琴挑剔。玉潤珠圓眞是白　音。曾記得屛底獨兒窺醉眼。瑤　人醒鳳欽横。那一日匆匆掩袂陽關道。馬滑　濃月下行。到如今欲遣靑靑河畔草。將愁直到短長亭。只落得裁衣蜂蝶無聊賴。偷買胭脂抱落英。取以目斷橋邊烟水綠。本蘭堂北踐殘春。埋怨東皇忒費心。</p>

<h3>戲院中的領座人亦有做電影明星的希望</h3>
<p>— 宜吉</p>
<p>我們普通稱他們爲「看座兒的，」或是「案目，」但是我們每次提到了這種「看座兒的」，尤其是上海各大舞台的「案目，」未免覺得有些頭疼，因爲他們需索陋規的方法，層出不窮，什麽瓜子哩，水菓哩，手巾把哩，簡直他們拿的比票價還多，並且這般人根深蒂固，無法可以剷除的。但是我們現在所要講的，却不是這種濃眉大眼，手撑着腰，惡狠狠等着你掏腰包，等到黑眼珠子看見了花花綠綠的鈔票，就笑逐顏開的「案目。」我們要說的是年紀輕輕，鬍子剃得光光，穿着整整齊齊的制服，手裏拿着電筒，在電影塲的門口，接過了你的票子，很客氣領你到座位上的人。我們要將他們和舊戲舞台所用的那種案目，分別開來，所以就呌他們爲「領座人」。</p>
<p>這種領座人，亦是戲院的職員或工役，他們靠工錢吃飯，並不需索敲詐，所以他們雖然談不到受人家崇敬，卻也並不討人厭惡。當門路伐羅，從前就是其中的一個。已故的范侖鐵諾亦是其中的一個。喬治賴甫脫從前亦是其中的一個。這三位紅極一時的風流小生，想不到都是出身於影戲院的領座人，還有許多其他的男女明星，當然這件事值得我們提一提了。</p>
<p>雷門諾伐羅（Ramon-Novarro）在沒有被大導演殷格蘭（Rex　Ingram）提拔起來，拍了那張「僧塔囚徒」（The　Prisoner　of　Zenda）之前，他在落杉磯的寬街影戲院做着領座人。但是那時誰認識他？他一天帶領了幾百幾千個看客，到他拉座位上，帶了多少個禮拜，多少個年月。但是誰知道這位黑赤赤的墨西哥少年，一旦會發出光輝，比他手裏拿的電筒還亮，而成爲電影蒼穹之中的一顆星體呢？</p>
<p>那時范侖鐵諾（Rudolpoh　Valentino）早已紅極一時了。他的星運昇到了空前的高度。他是千萬女子所崇拜的偶像。千萬家戲院爭奪着他的作品。他的榮名，超過了四騎士的速度，傳遍了全世界。許多軼聞逸事因此而發生起來，有些是確實的，有些是亳無根據的。但是歸根到底，有兩件事是確鑿不移的。一件是他曾做過公共汽車的司機。一件是他曾做過影戲院的領座人。</p>
<p>什麽事業的歷史中，都有許多羅曼斯，可作茶餘酒後的談座的，而這兩位大明星，范侖鐵諾和雷門諾伐羅，却都前後出身於同一影戲院的領座人，亦就是影史中談話之一。但是事惰的離奇，却還不止這一端。</p>
<p>大導演殷格蘭的「僧塔囚徒，」在開拍的前夕，殷格蘭忽然和范侖鐵諾爭吵起來。范侖鐵諾本是殷格蘭一手提拔起來的人，殷格蘭給他一氣，就立誓再造就一個同樣的男明星，並且因爲范侖鐵諾從前不過是一個戲院裏的平凡的領座人，他忽然想起了雷門諾伐羅，寬街影戲院的一個領座人，有熱烈的電影慾望，苦於不得門路的人。他立即去將雷門叫了來，毅然决然地派了他做「僧塔囚徒」的主角。他對於范侖鐵諾的氣憤，却更使他對於雷門諾伐羅期望殷切。果然，殷格蘭具有魔術的手腕，竟不崇朝而造就了一位亮晶晶的新星。</p>
<p>雷門諾伐羅上昇的速度，竟追蹤了他的前驅者。他在幾個月之內，成了范侖鐵諾的勁敵。他們競爭著，都要做銀幕上最大的情人。這樣一來，一個墨西哥人，弄得全美國的婦女們神魂顚倒，坐臥不安起來，全影界充滿了臘丁派羅曼斯的空氣，使一般男子們亦相習成風起來。</p>
<p>他們怎麽會有這種籠絡女子的本領的？他們怎麼會深切了解女子的心理的？原來是因爲他們做過影戲院的領座人，他們在做領座人的時候，首先和觀衆接觸了，知道了他們喜歡看銀幕上什麽樣子的男子。他們在穿堂中，過道上，聽見了一般女子對於男子的批評，比別人要淸楚些。他們一天一天的看着聽着，耳濡目染，久而久之，銀幕上男明星的所以能博得大衆歡心的動作，都印在他們的心裏，使他們自己表演的時候，居然出神入化起來。、</p>
<p>這並不是空話。我們再拿一個風流小生來作證。喬治賴甫脫（George　Raft）就是一個。他不是墨西哥人，亦不是意大利人，但是他活像范侖鐵諾，因此他的作風，竟亦追踪了已往的意大利大情人。但他從前亦是紐約一家Capitol　Theate的領座人。他的The　Trnmpt　Blows”不是和范侖鐵諾的“Bloodandsand”一個風味的嗎？這樣看來，影劇院却是造就電影明星的職業學校。因此，我奉勸一般做領座人的，不要輕視了自己的地位。他們可以這樣…，舜亦人也，吾亦人也，吾何畏彼哉！</p>

<h3>「逃亡」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 茅棣</p>
<p>「逃亡」是一部具有健全意識，極力暴露現實的優秀作品。不消說，劇作者的目的，是在反帝抗日，同時又反映着在帝國主義壓迫之下，這些難民　轉困苦地逃亡的悲痛情狀。</p>
<p>茫茫的廣大沙漠上，流浪着許多旣凍且餒，無家可歸的難民，他們前無去處，後無歸路，顚沛困苦的慘狀，這使誰見了，都感覺傷心，憤怒，而爲之悽然下淚啊！</p>
<p>其他如寫投機的大善士，把募捐得來的振災欵子，只輕輕的在算盤子上撥下幾擋，便穩穩的入了自己腰包；如花花公子的恣意享樂，蹂躪女子；如難民吃不到薄粥，反受鞭打，等等，都是使人憤恨而激起奔放的熱血，恨不得把這些敗類都一個個的「白刀子進，紅刀子出」</p>
<p>但是最後王引慷慨激昂的演說，和難民拿起鋤鈀向前綫開發去收復失地，成了一條不重要的尾巴。</p>
<p>導演的乎法，是非常技巧的，一半也得歸功於背景的眞實，如大火，逃亡等，而幾個比擬化入的小地方也頗能動人。</p>
<p>幾個演員的純熟演技，自然也帮助了劇情的進展，而使其能格外生色：不過二支歌曲似乎是勉强挿入。</p>
<p>我們可以這樣說：「逃亡」有「大路」的風味，但後者的刺激人們，沒有前者那樣的深刻。</p>
<h3>觀「逃亡」後感</h3>
<p>— 呆</p>
<p>「逃亡」，我承認這劇本是現實的，在整個的民族麻木得不知痛癢，把九一八東北失地千里，一二八閘北葬送在砲火之中都完全忘懷了的時候，這劇本尤其是需要的。</p>
<p>「逃亡」開始就展開了塞外的一幅農民遊牧生活的圖畫，使我們感到這種生活比都市生活的塵囂要純潔得多，在不知不覺中由羨慕而很想把這種生活去體騐一下，但這幅圖畫終於破敵人的飛機大砲撕得紛碎，而安居樂業的農民，也一變而爲無家可歸的逃亡者，這是誰給予我們的痛苦呢！</p>
<p>農村中的男女，對於老夫的侍奉，竟有如是的孝道，就是在逃亡之中，也拚命的掙扎而爲老父作護衛，以及兄妹間的愛，鄰居中的義，均使都市中的觀衆感到自嘆弗如！</p>
<p>「逃亡」更寫出了難民在逃亡之中，會有一般殺人不貶眼的惡人利用他們的無家可歸，去拐騙和引誘良家的少女，正和閘北之戰，會有漢奸爲敵人而活動一樣，這種非人的行爲是多麼的可恨啊！</p>
<p>慈善家雖然不能一概抹煞，但至少有一部份是假借了慈善而飽私囊，擅作威福的，在「逃亡」中是毫不留情的寫出了這種僞慈善家的醜態。</p>
<p>最後「逃亡」更明白的揭示我們，敵人得步進步的侵略，我們祇是逃亡，祇是去依賴慈善家，並不是我們的出路，而我們唯一的出路，乃是在於不怕一切的去收回失地。</p>
<p>無疑的，「逃亡」在導演上，在演出上，還不免有很多不滿人意的地方，但劇本的編製，我們無論如何認爲是有意識的，這和那些不關痛　，不能針對中國病態的電影劇本，自然是不能相提並論了。</p>
<h3>「逃亡」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 恒光</p>
<p>在帝國主義者殘暴横行，而用飛機大砲去侵奪我國領土的今日，「逃亡」的獻映，的確是一部暴露現實的作品。</p>
<p>「逃亡」給看衆的印象是痛恨帝國主義的兇殘，厭惡戰爭的慘酷；而引起人們反帝反戰爭的情緒，這點乃是「逃亡」的成功。但可惜，在這農村經濟破產的時候，正有整千整萬的失業者在逃亡，許許多多的災民在流蕩，這普遍現實的逃亡，却是「逃亡」的劇作者沒有注意到的事實。</p>
<p>至於「逃亡」題材的剪接，暴露的恰當，演技的圓熱，外景的罕見，這些都值得注意，讚美的。更如惠善家假面具的拆穿，女童子軍之易於募捐，難民的搗毀董公館表示羣衆力量的偉大，難民生活之凄慘等也都很巧妙而恰當的暴露着了。</p>
<h3>「美人玩物」主角朗白的「心笑」的故事</h3>
<p>— 國城</p>
<p>現在南京開映卡洛兒朗白主演的「美人玩物」，而下面所記的，就是關於朗白個人的一叚「笑」的故事。</p>
<p>這件事情發生在一九二四年。那是非常駭人的一輛汽車遇禍而撞碎了，朗白正坐在車廂裏。於是她受了極重的傷，她的臉面和頸脖流著很多的血，性命十分危險。那時醫生也爲她擔憂，生怕她卽使不死，也將一生成爲一個面部殘缺的人。</p>
<p>她自己一人住在病院中，精神上極感痛苦，特別是當有什麼人走進她房中，看見她頭上面上頸上纏縛着許多绷帶的怪模樣。她知道他們會離開了她在她背後去談論的。她一心只想恢復原有的容貌。所以她什麽也不管，成天使自己心裏去想許多快活而有趣的事情；但是她却不能笑出來，因爲如果一笑，就會使得面部的肌肉活動，而這種肌肉的活動，却是不利於她的創傷的，或是會使她的皮膚起裂紋的。</p>
<p>這只有一條辦法，就是在她的朋友向她講一些可笑的事情的時候，她便努力去學習一種所謂「心笑」，而不令她面部的表情動一動。她這樣過了八個月，她的朋友們簡直連她的性情也摸不出了。</p>
<p>後來她傷勢痊愈從病院出來！你們能知道她第一件事是做的什麼嗎？那就是：她用盡了吃奶的力氣，狠狠地大笑了一場。因為她有多久未做過有面部的口部出聲的笑了！</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>印度亡國恨（Clive　Of　India）（十一）</h3>
<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>克萊夫正在和總督畢格德談話之際，他忽然聽見外面有一個印度賣芒果的婦人，在外面號哭。他忽然心有所觸，連忙拔步向外走去。總督亦在後面跟着。克萊夫走到外面，問着克拉克隊長，那個衣服破爛的老太婆要什麼。克拉克說道：「她來到此地，一下午不肯走開。她口口聲聲說對岸的芒果比此地的好，亦不知道她是什麼意思。」克萊夫聽了，心中突然一動。他微笑對着總督望了一眼，就將那婦人引到他自己的帳幕前面，總督和艾德蒙亦就隨即跟了來。</p>
<p>那婦人到了帳幕的前面，就將一簍的芒果，恭而敬之地獻給了克萊夫。艾德蒙在一旁喊道：「勞伯特，不要動它，恐怕是有毒的！」但是克萊夫却講着一口印度話，和那老太婆談着話。那老太婆，回又走進了克萊夫的身旁，從那簍芒果下面，抽出一雙拖鞋來，塞在克萊夫的手裏。克萊夫接了那雙拖鞋，就叫克拉克多多給她錢，打發她走了。</p>
<p>克萊夫手裏拿着那雙拖鞋，四面摸了一回，然後抽出一把小刀來，將其中一隻鞋的鞋底，割了開來，從裏面抽出一張紙條來。他就對着總督和艾德蒙拋了一個眼色，大家走進了帳幕。克萊夫捋那張紙條打開一看，原來是密爾耶法送來的密信，上面寫着：「快渡河。如果可能，我將以三萬人和你會合。我還沒有敢動。速度河。下攻擊令。等到可能的時候，我就來和你會合。」</p>
<p>「如果可能……等到可能的時候……」克萊夫自言自語地念着。總督畢格德突然喊道：「不差的！一定是個狡計！現在信風快要發了。信風一發，潮水一漲，你前面有强敵，後面是洪水横流。到了那時，你就入了天羅地網了！」克萊夫亦自言自語道：「不錯，不錯。」總督於是揮着手，呌艾德蒙立即後退。他並且吩咐克萊夫道：「克萊夫上校，你萬萬切勿渡河！如果密爾耶法不來和你會合，你前面就有六萬步兵，和兩萬馬兵，和你作戰。你祗有八百名英軍，和兩千個土兵，你切不可將我們全體的生命，作孤注一擲……再則，你的夫人亦在其中！」</p>
<p>克萊夫惘然道：「你當我不知道這個嗎？我問你，我從來敗過沒有？」總督遲疑着不即加以答覆。信風或者在兩天之內不來……機會還沒有全失……他於是說道：「你先送一個信給密爾耶法，呌他帶了兵在淫雨未降之前，在此處會合。不然條約就取消了。這是我最後的訓令！」他說着，又縐着眉對着克萊夫道：「我現在要回去了。你有什麽話，或是什麽信，帶給你的夫人的沒有？」克萊夫道：「我沒有功夫寫信了。請你和她說一聲，我現在已經到了站在歧途上的時候了。她聽了會明白的……我很想會她。」總督道：「我親口替你傳這個口信。」他說着，和克萊夫道了一個晚安，就走出去了。</p>
<p>總督走了之後，艾德蒙走了進來。克萊夫歎着氣說道：「艾德蒙，好像舉世的人都在反對我。我問你……你吿訴我……」他說着，又歎了一口氣，因爲艾德蒙囁嚅着不開口，而他的意思却很明顯地表示了。克萊夫於是一個人走了帳幕的門前站着，悵然望着前面一片汪洋的河面。（未完）</p>

<h3>汽車用電須知</h3>
<p>— 陳星</p>
<p>汽車上。每一機件的使用。都應有正當的方法。合理的手續。對於用電。也是如此。茲將有關汽車用電各點。分述如下。</p>
<p>（一）開水的時候。以鑰或鈕接通發火電路。電表上的指針。應指向「Discharge」（耗電）一邊。如表針仍屹然不動。則發火系必有弊病。須加診治。</p>
<p>（二）掀或踩起動馬達鈕。應着實。不得忽鬆忽緊。時間幾秒鐘已够。不可過久。致損電池。天寒時可將克拉子同時踏下。這樣。馬達更易搖動引擎。引擎發動後。應立卽鬆去。使恢復原狀。</p>
<p>（三）車子開出後。速率達每小時十至十二英里。雖不燃燈。而電表指針。仍不指至「Charge（充電）」一邊。卽宜將車停下。施以檢査。並加修理。</p>
<p>（四）喇叭。大聲用於曠野。小聲用於閙市。宜遵照施行。勿得有誤。無必要時。不得多欽。尤其在熱閙處。更應如此。</p>
<p>（五）夜晚行車。郊野用大光燈。街巿用小光燈。勿可顚倒亂用。交車時。大光應調小光。或竟熄去。使對方司機視綫。不致爲燈光所擾亂。而免禍端。</p>
<p>（六）發電機充入電池之電。宜斟酌需要。而定增减。如日間行駛長路。則充電率可以减少。反之。如停車的次數很多。則充電率應該增加。但普通平均充電率。均不能超過十安培。</p>
<p>（七）要增减發電機的充電率。可將發電機蓋移開。移動第三電刷，向旋轉之方向移過。如增加充電率。向逆轉之方向移過。爲减低充電率。冬日用電較多。應將第三電刷向旋轉方向移過少許。以增充電率。</p>
<p>（八）發電機的導電體及電刷。每三個月。應作一次打磨與整潔。使發電機可以順利工作。</p>
<p>（九）電池宜每週察看。如發覺水量不足。須卽以蒸溜水加滿之。但勿加以電液。冬季加水。應在用車之前。</p>
<p>（十）電池之安培時若干。及伏爾脫多少。（例如福特V形八缸車。所用爲八十安培時。六伏爾脫的電池）應照規定。調換電池時。須加注意。</p>
<p>（十一）引擎停止動作。須卽將發火電路離斷。不得燃燈。撳喇叭。使電池蒙受意外的損失。</p>
<p>（十二）電池蓄電多寡。可以比重表測知。比重在L275—L300。密度之間。則蓄電充足。若爲L265—L260。密度。則所蓄之電。已漸消耗。普通用鉗子柄。橫接電椿。使發火花。以　蓄電量之方法。須盡可能避免。</p>
<p>（十三）電池之各電瓶塞蓋。上有氣孔。須時加注意。使不爲污垢所堵塞。電池外面。應常洗凈。遇汚穢不堪的時候。可以阿母尼亞與蘇打水洗之。</p>
<p>（十四）電椿頭四週。宜常使淸潔。如發生汚垢。可用平細銼刀。刮除淸潔。再以凡士林塗上。以减腐蝕至最小限度。</p>
<p>（十五）電池耗水過多。係充入之電率太甚。此時應將發電機之充電率减低。比重過低時。係發電機所供之電率不足。此時宜將充電率增高。</p>
<p>（十六）車輛長期不用時。須將電池陰陽電椿所裝之電綫鬆去。各電瓶中。並須加滿蒸溜水。於裝回時。則其搭鐵（或陽極或陰極）應遵原來規定。不得有誤。裝回後。宜將鐵鋏鎖緊。勿使電池受劇烈之搖蕩。</p>
<p>（十七）冬季電池應常保其有充足之電量。比重至少須在L250密度。否則。卽有冰凍之危險。</p>
<p>（十八）各電瓶之塞蓋。須絞緊。防止電液溢出。電液含有酸性。勿使傾注於車漆及座塾上。以免被損。</p>
<p>（十九）分電器蓋上連接火星塞之皮綫。係依汽缸發火次序裝上。切勿任意調換。</p>
<p>（二十）新式車輛。火星遲早。多係自勁調節。若非自動。則發動引擎時。火星鈕須置於最遲處。引擎轉動速率增加則火星鈕亦應隨之置於較早地位。</p>
<p>（二十）（一）分電器內之斷電點。倘被燒損壞。以致發火不勻。可以製鐘錶或飾物之銼刀。揷入接觸點。以手指用力將兩觸面壓平。此爲最妥方法。應避免時以銼刀磨刮。</p>
<p>（二十二）分電器蓋上所特製之管狀皮綫接頭物。若被油液或水漬浸入。則可阻碍發火工作。故須留心防免。如無意被沾。則卽應以乾布揩凈。</p>
<p>（二十三）火星塞須常加騐視。磁體如被炭積蓋塞。則須以小刀刮去之。並以汽油洗凈。間隙若太闊。或過月狹。則宜加以調節。其正當間隙。約爲千分之二十五英寸。</p>
<p>（二十四）車行一萬英里後。最好將火星塞換新。因火星塞易壞。換新可使引擎工作順利。及所產動力增强。</p>
<p>（二十五）燈泡之電壓與燭光。須照原來之規定。當調換時。應加留意。切勿隨便換上。</p>
<p>（二十六）發電機及分電器旁。設有油孔與汕杯。車行五百或一千英里。應加滿引擎油一次。</p>
<p>（二十七）洗車之水。不得使浸沾電綫。汽缸蓋裝火星塞處。及電系其他各伴上。致生漏電。而妨碍其工作。</p>
<p>（二十八）電綫電索。稍有破損。卽須調換。否則。以膠布包扎之。亦暫時可用。</p>
<p>（二十九）應不時檢視所有電綫接頭。有無鬆脫。A檢查連接火星塞各綫。B檢査連接升電盒各綫。C檢査發電機及斷電器之連綫。D檢査起動馬達與電池之連綫。L連接於表板上之各綫。</p>
<p>（三十）引擎如已停止勁作。電燈亦已熄滅。而電表表針。仍指「Discharge」。則可於電池上擇一電椿。取去其連綫。此時如表針至「0」處。則電系必有漏電處。應加修理。</p>

<h3>Unfinished River Works to be Handed Over to Kong and Li; Hu Yuanhui Departs Work Site; Qi Shou'an Oversees Reinforcement of Taihang Dike; Shouzhang County Seat Surrounded by Water</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Hu Yuanhui telegraphed Tianjin stating he has departed the Yellow River construction site and arrived in Handan on the 25th. He is expected to return to Tianjin by the 28th. All unfinished work matters will be handed over to Li Yizhi and Kong Xianrong. The Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee telegraphed nine counties in southern Hebei, including Changyuan, Puyang, Qingfeng, Nanle, and Daming, to assist the Central Yellow River Engineering Bureau in diligently repairing the Jin Dike and completing it before the flood season to ensure the safety of southern Hebei. A separate telegram was sent to the Changyuan County Magistrate, instructing him to inform the public that the Guantai breach closure project and the construction of the Jin Dike will continue to be handled by the Central Government to satisfy public expectations. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Changyuan County Magistrate Zhang Qinglu telegraphed the province stating that the Yellow River's water level remains unchanged, but the wind remains strong, with whitecaps rising several feet high, impacting the bank and eroding the revetments increasingly. The Taihang Dike is currently being overseen by River Bureau Director Qi Shou'an, who is stationed there to supervise the emergency repairs. The Ying Shui dam outside Changyuan's east gate is awaiting materials before construction can begin immediately. The water depth outside the city remains above eight feet.

<h3>The Economic Commission No Longer Participating in the Salachi Irrigation Project; Explanation of Reasons</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Commission issued the following statement today: "The Commission's decision to cease participation in the Salachi irrigation project in Suiyuan Province has elicited external criticism. Therefore, we hereby state the reasons as follows: The Salachi irrigation project in Suiyuan began in the 17th year of the Republic [1928]. The following year, due to severe droughts in various provinces, the China International Famine Relief Commission urgently sought to provide work for disaster victims and consequently loaned funds to the Suiyuan Provincial Government and oversaw the project. By the 21st year [1932], the Relief Commission deemed its mission complete and transferred the responsibility of management to a mixed committee jointly formed by the Provincial Government and local groups affiliated with the Commission. The project cost a total of 860,000 yuan at the time. However, the actual results were quite disappointing, and it was understood that even more capital would be needed to achieve greater benefits. Therefore, in January of the 23rd year [1934], the Suiyuan Provincial Government requested assistance from this Commission. As the Commission's purpose is to assist economically sound enterprises, it immediately began studying the Salachi project's engineering status and the necessity of expanding it. However, due to a lack of reference materials, progress was difficult. It was subsequently learned that when the project began, the local topography had not been thoroughly surveyed, and the Yellow River's water volume as a source of irrigation had not been deeply studied. Therefore, in the summer and autumn of the 23rd year, this Commission specially sent personnel to Sa to conduct an investigation and sought the opinion of the League of Nations Technical Cooperation Engineering Committee. Committee members such as Walmodou were all hydraulic experts. Mr. Walmodou and construction engineering expert Sa Douli personally went to Sa from December 12th to 26th of last year to conduct an inspection. Upon returning to Beiping, they thoroughly discussed the matter with all related parties. By this time, the Commission's investigation had also been completed. After consulting with the League of Nations experts upon Mr. Walmodou's return to Beijing, they unanimously recommended ceasing participation. The Commission's decision was originally based on this detailed investigation and the advice of impartial experts. As for the technical report, it will be published when the League of Nations experts return to Geneva, sometime this summer." (Guomin News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Sui-Mongol Tax Dispute; Opinions Gradually Converging; Fu Zuoyi Refutes Various Points Stated by Prince De</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Sui-Mongol tax dispute, Sui representatives Li Zhizheng and Shi Huayan visited He Yingqin twice yesterday to seek instructions on everything. They also visited Song Zheyuan multiple times yesterday and today for discussions. Opinions from all parties are gradually converging, and formal consultations are expected in the coming days. Fu Zuoyi also sent a telegram to He, refuting various points stated by Prince De. The original text was over 700 characters, and the gist is as follows: (1) The Mongol Political Council is responsible for handling local autonomous government affairs of various leagues and banners. That is, the autonomous system is subordinate to the Council, while the administrative system is subordinate to the Executive Yuan's Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the Provincial Government, etc. (2) The seventh article of the principles of autonomy stipulates that a certain percentage of various local taxes collected by the province and counties in the leagues and banners must be allocated to the leagues and banners. It is clearly stipulated that the province and counties can collect local taxes in the Mongol territories. However, the Council mistakenly interprets this as meaning that the province and counties have no right to establish checkpoints in the Mongol territories and even claims that if counties have been established and local taxes are collected, a certain percentage must still be allocated to the Mongols, which is a misunderstanding of the facts. Moreover, the allocation is for the league and banner governments, not the Mongol Political Council. (3) The eighth article of the principles of autonomy states that no new counties or administrative bureaus will be established in the leagues and banners in the future. This is a principled regulation regarding the establishment of new counties and has nothing to do with the issue of tax allocation. Furthermore, the stationing of troops is for national defense and bandit suppression, and the Council has no right to interfere. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He [Yingqin] is scheduled to host a banquet for Mongol and Sui representatives Li Zhizheng, Shi Huayan, and Bao Yueqing tomorrow evening, uniting the prestige of all parties. Song Zheyuan is scheduled to return to Cha tomorrow afternoon, accompanied by Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Prince De sent Mongol Political Council member and prince Guoer Zhuoerzhapu to Mount Wutai to pay respects to Zhangjia Buddha, report on the recent situation of Mongol politics, and urge him to return to Mongolia. Zhang is scheduled to leave Mount Wutai the day after tomorrow and first go to Ping. Various Mongol princes and important officials have been flocking to Mount Wutai to offer incense recently. Prince Suo visited the Bingyuan Northwest Company's various factories today. Zhu Jia and others all visited the hotel to meet with him. Prince Suo presented cabinet with twelve fine horses, which have already been transported to Bing yesterday. Yan [Xishan] reciprocated by giving Prince Suo many kinds of local products as gifts, and personnel have already been dispatched to transport them to Cha. Prince Suo has decided to go to Ping the day after tomorrow. The Zhengtai and Pinghan railway bureaus have both prepared special trains. Prince Suo dispatched personnel to Shizhuang today to prepare everything. Prince A is currently traveling from Sui to Ping and is scheduled to come to Bing within the next few days to visit Mount Wutai. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Alatan Oqir, Deputy League Leader of Yike Zhao and member of the Mongol Political Council, arrived in Ping from Sui at 6 PM on the afternoon of the 26th with his family and over ten attendants. Fu Zuoyi's representative Ma Ren and Shi Huayan's representative Kang Guoping, as well as Zhang Zirong, section chief of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's Beiping office, and over twenty others welcomed him at the station. Alatan Oqir told reporters at the station that he was here to visit Chairman He [Yingqin] and present his views on the Sui-Mongol tax issue. The Mongol Council has decided to obey the Central Government on this matter. He himself will stay in Beiping for two weeks before returning to Sui. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Mongol-Sui tax dispute has been discussed repeatedly in Ping, and the opinions of both sides have gradually converged. Both sides are currently seeking instructions from their superiors. Shi Huayan and Li Zhizheng visited Mo Zheyuan and Xiao Zhenying again on the morning of the 26th to discuss everything. After receiving replies and expressions of opinion from all parties, the two sides will formally consult again to discuss specific measures. It is expected that a resolution will be reached soon.

<h3>Disobedient Militia in Yutian Defeated by Security Forces; Wang Chengzhu's Troops Forced to Withdraw; Zhou Yuying Increases Troop Deployment for Joint Defense; Yin Rugeng and Yi Wo Go to Handle the Matter</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The conflict between the Yutian security forces and the militia began early on the 25th.

The four city gates have been tightly closed since the night of the 24th, and pedestrians are being inspected during the day. The illegal militia occupied various locations, including Liujiaqiao, Ya Hongqiao, Lin Nancang Bo, Zhushu Wu, and Zhao Jiapu, and built solid trenches to resist. Gunfire erupted early on the 25th, and contact occurred simultaneously in various towns and villages. Residents fled one after another. Traffic between inside and outside the city and between Zunhua, Tangshan, Yutian, and Fengrun was cut off. Telegraph and telephone lines were all out of service. Wang Jizong led 1700 men to occupy Ya Hongqiao, engaging in fierce fighting with Zhou Yuying's main force. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhou Yuying's Security Third Regiment has increased the deployment of a battalion to Yutian for joint defense, which has been agreed to by the Japanese side. It arrived in Yutian from Funing on the 25th. Yin Rugeng negotiated with the Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters to transport eight heavy machine guns to Yutian for use by Zhou Yuying's troops. They have already been transported. At 2:40 PM on the 25th, Yin Rugeng and Senior Staff Officer Obokura Yoshiyuki of the Tianjin Japanese Army arrived in Tangshan together. Yi Wo, Chief of the Shanhaiguan Japanese Special Service Agency, also arrived in Tangshan at 9:45 AM on the 25th. Tao Shangming hosted them at the Commissioner's Office on the evening of the 25th. On the morning of the 26th, they took a long-distance bus to Yutian to monitor Zhou Yuying's troops' resolution of Wang Jizong's illegal militia. They will then travel to Tong County on the 28th or so to investigate the current status of the reorganization of Li Yunshang's security forces. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The battles in Ya Hongqiao and Lin Nancang Bo have ceased. On the afternoon of the 25th, Wang Jizong's troops and Liu Guitang's bandits suffered heavy casualties under the fierce attack of the security forces. A large fire raged in Ya Hong Town. Wang could not resist and led his troops to break through the encirclement and retreat to Qianjiagou, on the border of Fengrun and Yutian counties, where they dug trenches to defend. Liu Guitang's bandits retreated towards Liujiaqiao and Zhao Jiapu. The security forces split up to pursue. Zhou Yuying's troops, newly arrived from Wenning and Xinkai, have dispatched a portion of their forces to pursue and suppress in all directions. Militias have been dispatched to garrison the borders of Fengrun, Yutian, Tangshan, and Zunhua to prevent Wang Jizong's troops from fleeing into them. The Yutian Post Office's statistics show that the Security Supplementary Force stationed in the county for the past year extorted a total of 1,267,000 yuan in property from wealthy households and remitted it abroad. Of these remittances, those made by Japanese and Korean drug trading firms totaled 100,000 yuan, the most. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The War Zone Clearing Committee will convene a regular meeting tomorrow morning to discuss methods for reorganizing security forces and militias, as well as bandit suppression issues. Notices were issued today. With the exception of Yin Rugeng, who is not in Ping, all other commissioners will attend. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After arriving in Tangshan from Tianjin yesterday, Yin Rugeng is scheduled to go to Yutian today. Staff Officer Obokura of the Tianjin-based Japanese Army and Yi Wo, chief of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Yushu, will also go with him. Yin and others will stay in Yutian for several days to be responsible for handling the reorganization of the militia. After inspecting places like Xiadian and Yanjiao, they will return to Ping. Related sources said that over a hundred bandits from Zunhua had fled into Qian'an County yesterday. Wang Chengzhu's troops from the Ya Hongqiao militia were disarmed by Zhou Yuying's security forces and were forced to withdraw the night before last. In this battle, four security force members were killed and thirteen were injured. They are currently being tracked and encircled. A portion of the rebel Ya Hongqiao militia, about two hundred men, have fled into the Jingyu area of Zunhua County and have been surrounded by security forces and militias, making them easy to deal with. A small portion of the rebel Ya Hongqiao militia has also been discovered in Fengrun County, and security forces and militias have been dispatched to intercept them. Tong County has temporarily declared martial law for the past two days to prevent bandits from fleeing into the area. Dozens of bandits were discovered in Wanggezhuang in Shunyi County yesterday and can be easily dealt with. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Kailuan Miners' Conflict</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Five hundred workers at the Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Tianqiao, because they were prevented from working by the force of the contractor's hired gangsters, causing the miners underground to be unable to transport coal out, also declared a strike on the evening of the 24th. On the morning of the 25th, hundreds of Tianqiao workers, armed with weapons, clashed with the contractor's hired gangsters. As a result, seven or eight people were killed or injured on both sides. A police brigade arrived and used force to mediate before the crowd dispersed. The Tianqiao workers demanded that the system of workers contracting work for themselves not be abolished, and that the mining bureau compensate them for the wages of the days they were prevented from working. On the evening of the 25th, the crowd gathered and surrounded the mining area's Third Police Station. They dispersed only after the station made great efforts to persuade them. Yu Xifan of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau rushed to the scene on the morning of the 25th with Chief Inspector Li Jianzhang to handle the matter, and telegraphed the mining bureau to quickly dispatch important officials to assist. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Zhaogezhuang miners' unrest has subsided. After Yu Xifan's persuasion, he took responsibility for accepting the workers' conditions on behalf of the mining bureau and absolutely guaranteed that the system of workers contracting work for themselves would not be abolished. The workers agreed to resume work at 6 AM on the 26th, but demanded that the conditions be fully implemented within three days, otherwise they would go on strike again. The Third Police Station of the Zhaogezhuang Mine Police arrested six counter-revolutionary elements who were inciting workers to strike for a long time. They were sent to the Tangshan Public Security Bureau on the 26th for interrogation. The Kailuan Mining Area Police Team, under the provincial order, will be reorganized on April 1st into the Kailuan Mining Industry Police Headquarters, with Yu Xifan as the Director and Wei Dong, recommended by the Kailuan Mining Bureau, as the Deputy Director. Each station will be renamed a branch, with each branch having four police squads of forty men per squad. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Cadogan Visits Xu Mo to Continue Discussions on Various Sino-British Cases</h3>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Discusses the Situation of Financial Relief</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi received British Ambassador Cadogan at 5 PM on the afternoon of the 26th and talked for about twenty minutes. Someone met with Kong and inquired about the situation of China's contact with international parties to borrow funds, and the issuance of 100 million yuan in financial public bonds by the central government. Kong Xiangxi replied that in recent years, due to the dumping policies adopted by various countries in China, the interior has experienced banditry and natural disasters, rural areas have gone bankrupt, finance has been depleted, and both export and import trade have declined. Recently, the financial situation has become even more dangerous due to the impact of the US silver policy. In order to stabilize finance and seek to restore foreign trade, the central government has contacted various countries to borrow funds in order to save the situation. The contact is still ongoing. The status of all the contact is not yet at the stage for release. As for yesterday's news from London, that the Chinese government is seeking to borrow ten million pounds in British gold from the British government, this matter is obviously true. Kong continued, "At a time when the central government's military, administrative, and political expenses are strained, the central government is issuing 100 million yuan in financial public bonds to stabilize society and revitalize industry and commerce. I have been in Shanghai for several days to contact the responsible persons of the Central Bank and other banks. All banks have expressed their agreement with the government's move. In the future, the financial issue will gradually move onto the right track." (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Sichuan Transportation Commissioner to Reorganize Sichuan Province's Salt Affairs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 26th, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Sichuan Salt Transportation Commissioner to reorganize salt affairs in Sichuan Province, to dredge the Sichuan salt sales routes during the communist suppression period, stabilize the workers, and avoid stockpiling the products.

(Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Judicial Yuan Interprets Ambiguity in Sealed Property</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan now interprets the ambiguity of whether the national tax authority obtains priority of payment when sealing the property of a tax defaulter as follows: An administrative agency, based on the function of its administrative power, sealing the property of the people, and a court, based on the request of a party, implementing a provisional attachment on the property of a debtor, are two different things. If a court implements a provisional attachment on property that has already been sealed by an administrative agency, it is implementing it on property other than the purpose of the administrative agency's sealing. In the future, when this provisionally attached property is used for distribution, even if there are many creditors, they can only handle it within the scope of their attachment.

<h3>Zhang Fakui Visits Mausoleum Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Fakui led his entourage to visit the mausoleum on the morning of the 26th. He was guided by Ma Xiang to the auditorium, performed all the rites, and returned. Zhang said that he had traveled around Europe and the United States earlier this year, visiting 22 countries. He resided in London and Paris for a longer period of time. In all the countries he visited, he saw that they spared no effort in preparing for national defense. Germany's national defense equipment was especially advanced, and the entire country had become militarized. Recently, Germany's cancellation of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and the implementation of compulsory military service have made the European situation particularly uneasy. However, since the Great War, all countries have felt the danger of war. The majority of Europeans psychologically desire peace. To say that a second world war is about to break out seems premature, because today's European powers are actively expanding their armies on the one hand and advocating disarmament on the other hand, a contradictory phenomenon. As for China's future path, the only way forward is to strive for unity from top to bottom and to work hard. Zhang will fly to Chongqing after receiving a reply telegram from Chairman Chiang.

<h3>The Issue of Reducing the Transit and Export Taxes</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Finance has a plan to abolish transit taxes and reduce or exempt export taxes, which has been passed by the Central Political Council. (See the conversation between Minister Kong and the Central News Agency reporter.) This is indeed a measure that we have been longing for, and it is also the most essential and wisest. Without a solution to the trade deficit, the outflow of currency cannot be stopped. In the face of fierce international commercial competition, other countries are using managed trade, devalued currencies, and high tariffs to block imports and promote exports. Yet we still have transit taxes and export taxes, creating layers of obstacles to the development of export trade. How can we avoid a complete defeat and an increase in the trade deficit? At the annual meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce this year, Mr. Basha once said: "The Chinese government never considers exporters and often hinders the efforts of merchants to promote Chinese exports by increasing taxes and export duties. Although the development of export trade can provide jobs for tens of thousands of Chinese people and bring new capital into China, China does not make it its business to encourage this." Now that our government has paid attention to this, how can our industrialists and businessmen not be delighted?</p>
<p>Export taxes were originally levied for the sake of fiscal revenue. In earlier years, there were also two types of taxes: re-import tax and inland transit tax. These were abolished starting in January of the 20th year of the Republic. The current export tariff also grants tax-free exports to goods that were once important in exports but are now gradually declining, as well as emerging industrial products that need protection. Looking at the tariff schedule, there are about 38 categories listed below. The numbers listed in the table are the item numbers in the export tariff.</p>
<p>46 Broad beans, 48 Sorghum, 49 Maize, 50 Millet</p>
<p>51 Rice, 53 Wheat, 54 Unlisted miscellaneous grains, 23 Black tea</p>
<p>123 Brick tea, 124 Green tea, 125 Tea dust, 126 Raw tea</p>
<p>127 Scented tea, 128 Tea leaves, 129 Tea stalks, 130 Unlisted tea</p>
<p>180 Doupion silk, 181 White silk, 182 Gray silk, 183 Yellow silk</p>
<p>184 Waste silk, 186 Silk floss, 192 Cotton socks, 196 Drawn work, etc.</p>
<p>197 Lace, 199 Spun silk yarn, 204 Satin, 205 Tussah silk</p>
<p>222 Silk clothing, 217 Foreign currency, 250 Books, 251 Paintings</p>
<p>252 Various publications, 254 Straw hats, etc., 257 Packaging containers, 262 Hairnets</p>
<p>264 Umbrellas, 266 Lacquerware</p>
<p>According to recent news, the abolition of the transit tax seems inevitable, and a supplementary plan has been drafted and is under review. As for how to reduce or exempt export taxes, the details have not yet been revealed. In my opinion, the position of export taxes in the customs revenue has been gradually declining in recent years due to the decline in exports, from 47.831 million yuan in the 20th year of the Republic to 23.245 million yuan, and there has been no sign of recovery. In the past two years, it has not even reached 10% of the import tax amount. The following table shows the general situation. (Unit: thousands of national currency)</p>
<p>Import Tax, Export Tax, Transit Tax</p>
<p>20th Year of the Republic: 314,686 47,831 15,646</p>
<p>21st Year of the Republic: 236,291 26,777 20,552</p>
<p>22nd Year of the Republic: 265,611 23,245 18,003</p>
<p>23rd Year of the Republic: 261,021 24,700 16,900</p>
<p>Since export taxes are an obstacle to foreign exports, and their value is very small in the total tax revenue, even if they are completely abolished, although it will reduce a source of income for the treasury, who knows if it will not increase the national wealth? If it is difficult to completely abolish both taxes at once, then all goods that occupy an important position in current exports, except those that are necessary for the country or are special products of the country, should be granted tax exemption. If egg products have decreased significantly in exports in recent years, and soybeans and soybean cakes no longer have a position in export commodities, and tung oil and cotton have also declined, if no urgent remedy is sought, failure can be expected immediately. According to the International Trade Guide (Volume 7, Number 3), the percentage of the value of export commodities in the 23rd year of the Republic (as a percentage of the total export value of that year) is listed in the following order to see the general trend of export goods.</p>
<p>(1) Tea 6.74%, (2) Cotton yarn 5.85%, (3) Metals 5.74%</p>
<p>(4) Egg products 5.65%, (5) Hides 5.44%, (6) Raw silk 5.31%</p>
<p>(7) Tung oil 4.90%, (8) Silk fabrics 3.64%, (9) Cotton 2.84%</p>
<p>(10) Hog bristles 2.83%, (11) Wool 2.43%, (12) Peanuts 2.31%</p>
<p>(13) Medicinal materials 1.89%, (14) Tobacco 1.76%, (15) Cotton cloth 1.64%</p>
<p>(16) Other 41.03%</p>
<p>Except for items (1), (6), and (8) in the table, which are already tax-exempt, the rest, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, coarse and fine ramie cloth, eggs and their products, peanuts, tanned leather, hides, bristles, tung oil, tea oil, cotton, tobacco, dried and fresh vegetables, medicinal materials, spices, and various carpets and rugs, are still subject to taxation. There are certainly many other products that need to be reduced or exempted. Now that the financial authorities are in the process of deliberation, they will surely implement it as soon as possible to comfort the eager expectations of the industrial and commercial sectors. Import taxes should also be increased at the same time to compensate for the losses. (If the tax rate is increased by 10%, it can offset the losses from the complete exemption of export and transit taxes.) If export taxes are abolished, import taxes are increased, and the industrial and commercial sectors can work hard to improve and seek the development of their own businesses, there may be hope for economic recovery.</p>

<p>(Washington) It was learned today that how the United States will deal with naval bases in the Philippines after independence has not yet been decided. The issues of guaranteeing the neutrality of the Philippines and the United States' guarantee of the territorial integrity of the Philippines are also pending. Some observers predicted today that this issue may be related to the future policy of the United States dealing with the League of Nations' entrustment of Germany's islands to Japan. However, Japan has declared that it has no intention of returning these islands after its formal withdrawal from the League of Nations takes effect tomorrow. Therefore, this unresolved issue and the return of the trusteeship islands may seriously affect the naval and political situation in the Western Pacific. Senate Speaker Quezon of the Philippines declared today that the Philippines intends to invite Secretary of War Dern, Senator Tydings, Representative Mcduffie, members of the Senate Committee on Territories and the House Committee on Insular Affairs to attend the inauguration ceremony of the autonomous government.

<h3>Mei Lanfang in the Eyes of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>(Moscow) After the official performance of the Chinese Opera Troupe, the Soviet newspapers commented extensively on Mei Lanfang's performance. Izvestia believes that the dance and gestures of the troupe are of great artistic significance. The famous Soviet female writer San Jining wrote an article published in Pravda, praising Mei's high level of performance cultivation. Literaturnaya Gazeta welcomes Mei as the representative of Chinese ancient opera for hundreds of years, and believes that Mei's performance can be used by the Soviet drama community to acquire cultural heritage from previous generations with a critical attitude. The Industrialization News said that during Mei's performance, the true understanding between the actors and the audience was not only established, but also enhanced. This point is completely opposed to the theory of fascism that the cultures of different races are incompatible. The newspaper commented on Mei's own performance: "Dr. Mei Lanfang plays female roles with subtlety and detail. He uses the richest emotions, patterns, and rhythmic movements to form an incomparably charming female image. Moscow has seen another world artist." (TASS Telegram on the 25th)</p>

<h3>The London Times Discusses the Mongolian Issue</h3>
<p>(London) The Times published an editorial today titled "The Revival of Mongolian Nationalism," discussing the existing triangular competition in Mongolia, saying that the Russians have more experience in Mongolia and the climate is more suitable, which is not something the Japanese can match, so they can have an advantage. However, the Soviet Union's hatred of religion is its weakness. Prince De may use China's fear to reject Japan's ambitions, so as to put himself in a more stable position. In short, the future of Mongolia is now an international issue. The Mongolian people, who previously seemed to be figures of the past in history, are now gradually emerging. They may not be willing to be puppets in the Far East diplomatic game forever. (Reuters Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Response to Britain on the Oil Monopoly Issue</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to semi-official sources, the Japanese government yesterday responded to the British government's protest of November 24 last year regarding the oil monopoly rights in Manchuria, stating, "From Japan's point of view, the establishment of the oil monopoly rights by 'Manchukuo' is not considered to violate any treaties or violate its declaration of the Open Door Policy. The United Kingdom completely disregards the reality of 'Manchukuo's' independence, but also cites the part of 'Manchukuo's' declaration that is beneficial to the United Kingdom's argument. In any case, the Japanese government cannot agree to any theory that makes Japan responsible for 'Manchukuo's' actions, nor can it accept any opinions based on non-recognition of 'Manchukuo.' Japan is prepared to mediate, but cannot interfere in 'Manchukuo's' internal affairs." (Reuters Telegram on the 26th)</p>

<h3>Anglo-German Continued Talks: Hitler Clarifies Stance, Opposes Eastern and Central European Pacts, Conditions Attached to Returning to the League of Nations, Yesterday's Talks Focused on Armaments</h3>
<p>(Berlin) France has appealed to the League of Nations regarding Germany's rearmament. If dealt with satisfactorily, Germany may return to the League. Germany views its army and navy size as still negotiable under certain circumstances. This is reportedly Hitler's direct response today to British Foreign Secretary Simon and Minister Eden's inquiries. According to well-informed sources, Hitler today extensively explained certain points of German foreign policy, particularly opposition to Eastern European and Danube River pacts. He also emphatically stated Germany's commitment to peace and willingness to cooperate in easing tensions in Europe. However, he did not elaborate much on the issue of German rearmament and its compulsory military service plans. Talks will continue tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM, when Germany's army and navy size and the possibility of Germany returning to the League of Nations will be discussed in detail. There will be no sensational announcements before Simon departs. People in Berlin believe that other countries now need to work hard before any final resolution of major issues can be announced. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning's Meeting</p>
<p>(Berlin) The British and German authorities continued their meeting at 10:30 this morning, with the issue of armaments as the main point of discussion. The British side was still represented by Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden. British Ambassador to Berlin, Phipps, also attended. Simon looked well after yesterday's efforts. The German side was still represented by Hitler, assisted by Foreign Minister Neurath and Special Envoy for Disarmament, General Ribbentrop.</p>
<p>Armaments as Main Topic</p>
<p>(Berlin) Anglo-German talks temporarily stopped at 1:20 PM. The British and German cabinet members all attended a luncheon at the British Embassy. Chancellor Hitler also personally participated. After the lunch, talks continued. According to information obtained by our correspondent, today's talks involved various issues related to the army, navy, and air force. British sources have summarized Chancellor Hitler's proposals, stating that if all countries completely disarm uniformly, Germany will do the same. If one country refuses to disarm, Germany must expand its armaments as much as possible. The size of the German army is set at 36 divisions, which is a common basis for distribution among countries, but the number of officers is not.</p>
<p>Germany Adopts a Two-Pronged Approach</p>
<p>Regarding the armaments issue, Germany will decide on any restrictions to its own plans based on the actions of other countries. Germany suggested to the British representatives that the main points of German foreign policy and its constructive proposals should be compiled by Hitler into a written memorandum. It is widely believed that Hitler's position on the armaments issue is that if all countries implement disarmament, Germany is willing to follow suit. If a country begins to expand its armaments, Germany will do the same. Regarding naval issues, it is reported that Hitler stated that the extent of Germany's naval rearmament, no matter what, requires several years of effort. The British side anticipates that Germany intends to shift the responsibility for the arms race onto the British negotiators. Therefore, they adopted a two-pronged approach in today's talks, consisting of three steps. The scale is very large, namely: (1) Hitler does not insist on the naval rearmament request, and the so-called 400,000 tons of navy is not a definite figure. (2) Hitler firmly supports the Air Pact, thereby proving that the German air force has the reason to be equal to the largest air force country. (3) Since the air force can be equal, the army and navy should be handled accordingly. As for Germany's proposed guarantee pact, senior British officials believe that it contains significant dangers, as this type of guarantee system could protect some of Germany's neighbors from aggression, while others may suffer as a result. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>No Concessions on Russian Armaments</p>
<p>It is reported that after discussing the situation of Soviet Russian armaments this morning, Hitler stated that unless Russia promises (1) to transfer the main part of its western border military force to the Far East and (2) to reduce its troop numbers, Germany cannot make major concessions on armaments.</p>
<p>Talks Not Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>Talks will continue at 4:00 PM this afternoon. It is reported that this morning's talks were far less smooth than yesterday's. Hitler did not seem to offer any special suggestions on the armaments issue.</p>
<p>Today's discussions will proceed according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p>(1) Eastern European Pact: Germany is unwilling to join the current form of the pact or is willing to conclude several regional pacts in accordance with the Polish-German agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Memel: Germany can conclude a non-aggression pact with Lithuania, provided that Lithuania adheres to the Memel Statute regarding the German minority.</p>
<p>(3) League of Nations: If France's lawsuit against Germany's rearmament to the League of Nations can be resolved satisfactorily, Germany is willing to return to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(4) Armaments: The size of the German army, navy, and air force can be negotiated in London. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Counterproposal to Eastern European Pact</p>
<p>(Berlin) During this morning's talks between British and German representatives, the German side refused to conclude the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact and proposed a counterproposal, advocating that countries bordering each other conclude non-aggression pacts, and that other countries conclude guarantee pacts. British cabinet members were quite surprised by Germany's counterproposal, which they found self-contradictory and ambiguous, and reportedly requested Head of State Hitler to explain its outline in writing. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Britain Strictly Prevents Information Leaks</p>
<p>It is reported that this morning's meeting focused on armaments and disarmament issues. Simon and Eden looked stern when they left the meeting. After lunch, the two stayed at the embassy for some time to talk deeply with Ambassador Phipps. The British representatives are now strictly on guard to prevent the leakage of information from the talks. German police officers are also on strict alert to protect the British guests. During the gathering, a police squad was prepared to take orders, and plainclothes detectives were mixed among the crowd.</p>
<p>Eden Prepares to Go to Moscow</p>
<p>Simon said that after the meeting ends, he plans to meet with foreign press representatives. At the same time, Eden has packed his bags and is preparing to depart for Moscow at midnight. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Memel Court Verdict Strengthens Hitler's Hand</p>
<p>Not long after the talks began, a telegram arrived from Kaunas, the capital of Lithuania, stating that 126 National Socialist Party members accused of plotting to overthrow the government and return Memel to Germany were severely punished by the Lithuanian authorities after interrogation. Four people were sentenced to death, two were sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, and the rest were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from eight to twelve years. All their property was confiscated. The news conveyed in this telegram may affect the resolution of the Memel issue. The Memel court's verdict is widely regarded as sufficient to strengthen Hitler's hand on the Memel issue. It is widely expected that the Memel trial will cause public outrage in Berlin and lead to strict demands on the Lithuanian authorities to reduce the sentences. After receiving this news at the meeting, Hitler stopped the discussion and presented the Memel issue to the British representatives for a considerable period of time. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Crowds Gather on Wilhelmstrasse, Wildly Cheering "Long Live German Head of State"</p>
<p>At 1:20 PM, British Foreign Secretary Simon hosted a banquet for National Socialist Party leaders at the British Embassy. At that time, more than a thousand people gathered on Wilhelmstrasse, waiting for Simon and Eden to arrive. General Goering, wearing a sky-blue, gold-trimmed air force general's uniform, arrived first. Everyone waved and wildly shouted "Long Live" to greet him. Soon after, Hitler also arrived, and the crowd cheered even more enthusiastically. Hitler responded with the National Socialist Party salute. Simon arrived immediately after and also received a warm welcome. A total of 50 people attended the banquet, including General Fritsch, a leader of the defense forces. Only Mrs. Phipps was a woman at the table. The gathering place was in the embassy's magnificent ballroom. Hitler looked particularly tired when he entered. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Germany Desires Peaceful Cooperation</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the Anglo-German talks, it is reported that Chancellor Hitler explained to the British cabinet members that Germany is very willing to immediately conclude a pact to limit armaments on the basis of equal rights and a collective security system.</p>
<p>Considers the Soviet Union a Great Enemy</p>
<p>It is also prepared to sign the proposed Western European Air Pact. However, Germany opposes any security system that includes the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Austria Should Have the Right to Self-Determination</p>
<p>As for the Danube River Pact plan (a pact of non-interference in the internal affairs among Central European countries), Germany opposes any system that maintains the status quo between Germany and Austria (i.e., the issue of German-Austrian merger). Germany will insist that the Austrian people have the right to self-determination in political affairs.</p>
<p>Conditions for Returning to the League of Nations</p>
<p>It is also reported that Chancellor Hitler supports Germany's return to the League of Nations, but only on the conditions that the League of Nations is reorganized, that the covenant is separated from the Treaty of Versailles, and that Germany's equal rights are fully recognized at the same time.</p>
<p>Does Not Forget the Memel Region</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Memel region, it is reported that Chancellor Hitler denied that Germany intends to take violent action in the area but stated that as long as the Memel system is not changed, the Memel issue will continue to be a point of contention. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to the Associated Press today, Germany may demand the autonomous region of Memel, which currently belongs to Lithuania. It is generally believed that although European countries may not immediately agree to this demand, the fate of Memel may be decided by a popular vote similar to that of the Saar. It is also reported that Germany may propose a popular vote in Memel as a condition for Hitler to make concessions on the issues of rearmament and security. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>The First Day of the Meeting</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the visit of British Ministers Simon and Eden to Berlin, the German government issued the following simple press release today:</p>
<p>Issued a Brief Communiqué: Head of State Hitler received British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden this morning. Foreign Minister Neurath and British Ambassador Phipps also participated in the talks. Meetings were held immediately in the morning and afternoon. All the points mentioned in the London Declaration were raised and discussed, and the talks will continue tomorrow. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Both Sides Meet with Sincerity</p>
<p>(Berlin) In yesterday's meeting between Britain and Germany, both sides were able to meet with sincerity. Therefore, the exchange of opinions was quite friendly. However, what Head of State Hitler and British Foreign Secretary Simon discussed yesterday mainly focused on eliminating misunderstandings and laying the groundwork for today's discussion of details. As of now, the situation of the negotiations can be said to be mostly optimistic. There is also one point, namely that a pending issue has been involved in the outline of yesterday's general discussion, namely the Eastern European Pact. Hitler expressed lengthy opinions on this. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Resolved Many Difficulties</p>
<p>According to newspaper reports, during today's talks, both sides clearly showed enthusiasm for fully stating their positions and seeking understanding. Mr. Hitler spoke the most and also explained in detail the German government's basic position on the Eastern Pact. According to general impressions from the outside world, the Anglo-German exchange of opinions has actually resolved many difficulties with all the issues, and there is no doubt that the UK is willing to explore the German viewpoints with impartial expectations. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Simon Refuses to See Guests</p>
<p>(Berlin) Many journalists gathered at the British Embassy, waiting to meet Simon, but their wish was not fulfilled. Eden announced that the British Foreign Secretary could not see guests due to overwork. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Banquet by German Foreign Minister</p>
<p>(Berlin) Tonight, Foreign Minister Neurath hosted a banquet to welcome British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden. About 90 people were invited to accompany them. Chancellor Hitler also came to participate. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Summarize Opinions on Current Issues</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Tonight, the Deutsche Tageszeitung summarized Germany's attitude towards the issues currently being discussed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Armaments: Germany must not be discriminated against. If other countries are willing to implement disarmament or restrictions, Germany is also willing to do so.</p>
<p>(2) Eastern European Pact: This is the source of disaster. Germany does not want to risk joining the struggles of other people. Germany feels that countries which should not be involved in regional agreements are those countries geographically located in a way inappropriate to hear about it.</p>
<p>(3) Danube River Pact: This pact must not prevent the development of natural relations between Germany and Austria or cause other countries to interfere in Austria's internal affairs.</p>
<p>(4) Air Pact: Germany has long declared its agreement to the League of Nations. Before the fundamental issues regarding security and equality are resolved, no decision can be made on this matter. This 'pact must not become a tool for one-sided debate. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Britain Clearly Opposes Germany's Breach of Treaty: Prime Minister's Words Relieve Doubts</h3>
<p>(London) The rumor that Britain has peacefully acquiesced to Germany's restoration of armaments was completely dispelled today by Prime Minister MacDonald in the House of Commons. In response to questioning, MacDonald declared that Germany has no right to abandon the treaty and said that there are no provisions in the treaty for repeal. "To say that Germany or any country's unilateral action can cause the treaty to be abandoned is a mistake." It is generally believed that the Prime Minister's words have swept away any doubts about the consensus of opinion among Britain, France, and Italy. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>French Premier Publishes an Article Calling for National Unity, Citing Soviet Russia's Military Expansion as an Example</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Flandin published an article tonight calling on the people of the country to unite to deal with the crisis caused by Germany's rearmament, saying that for the sake of patriotism, let us not be caught off guard. Feeling threatened, Soviet Russia is now actively expanding the Red Army, and the number of its people serving national defense has greatly increased. It is no wonder that Soviet Russia is proud of it. Soviet Russia is indeed giving us a better patriotic lesson. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>After the League of Nations Meeting, French Foreign Minister Goes to Moscow</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Council of the League of Nations is now scheduled to meet on April 15 to discuss the issue of Germany's rearmament. Foreign Minister Laval is scheduled to depart for Moscow on April 20, after the end of the meeting, to hold talks with the Soviet authorities. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Herriot Urges Cooperation Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>(Paris) Minister without Portfolio Herriot said in a speech in Limoges that Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles, he vigorously stated that his political opponents had previously launched fierce attacks on him for his strong support for the French-Soviet rapprochement policy. Now, they are summoned by the limitations of the situation and have to realize that they were wrong and embark on the path of consolidating French-Soviet friendship. (TASS, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Lord Privy Seal Talks with Russian Reporter</h3>
<p>(London) Before leaving for Berlin, British Lord Privy Seal Eden gave a speech to a TASS reporter. Mr. Eden was delighted about his upcoming trip to the Soviet Union, saying that it was a first for a British cabinet minister, so he cherished it very much. He was very willing to meet with those responsible for the fate of the great Soviet state and conduct effective cooperation. Mr. Eden believes that Britain and the Soviet Union, as advocates of the ideals of the League of Nations and cooperative security, jointly play a leading role in world politics. He believes that this trip will definitely make his beliefs even more solid. (TASS, 26th)</p>
<h3>France Vigorously Implements Air Defense, Expansion of Air Force Bill Passed by the Chamber of Deputies</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Chamber of Deputies passed a bill with 453 votes to 11, according to which the whole country will vigorously implement defenses against aerial attacks. A special revenue defensive committee will be set up to manage the affairs of civilians and volunteers who cannot be mobilized. The case stipulates that in the event of enemy air raids, the population in densely populated areas must be scattered in nearby villages, and orders will be issued at any time to conduct air defense exercises to train the people so as to avoid being caught off guard at the last minute. The case also stipulates that those who hear the alarm and do not immediately comply shall be subject to imprisonment of six days to one month. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies has passed a bill to expand the air force with 451 votes to 11. The bill stipulates that 99 percent of the expenses for constructing bomb shelters will be borne by the state, and the rest will be recognized by various agencies. According to estimates by socialist members of parliament, the total amount of this burden will be about 4 million francs. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>France Prohibits the Export of Military Raw Materials</h3>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet decided today to prohibit the export of a military raw material to maintain national defense. It is reported that this move was caused by Germany's purchase of large quantities of raw materials such as magnesium. Cotton and wood are also subject to the ban. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>The Second Meeting Place for Britain, France and Italy is Selected as Isola Bella in Northern Italy; Italian Vice-Minister Reports on Paris Talks, Seeks Comprehensive Solution to Armaments Issues, No Other Option than Agreement Guarantees</h3>
<p>(Paris) Italian Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Suvich returned to Rome today from Paris and immediately reported to Prime Minister Mussolini on the results of his talks with French Foreign Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Simon. It is learned that Isola Bella in Lake Maggiore has been selected as the future meeting place for the three countries. According to Italian observers, a real decision on the issue of German rearmament must be made at that meeting. Today, the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia reiterated in its editorial that there is no other good solution to the comprehensive solution to the arms issue in the future except for the necessary safeguards generated by common agreement. These safeguards are already outlined in the proposed Mutual Assistance Pact and the Danube River Non-Intervention Pact. The solution to the arms issue will not exceed this range in the future either. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Austria-Hungary Follows Germany's Lead, Demands Equal Rights, Italy Sympathizes, Little Entente Opposes, League of Nations Meets New Difficulties</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations began action today on France's lawsuit against Germany for violating the Treaty of Versailles so that the matter could be dealt with by the highest international peace organization. Countries belonging to the Council of the League of Nations have received a notification today from Secretary-General Avenol to convene a special meeting on April 15. Senior League of Nations officials expect that if the issue is formally voted on, the Council will rebuke Germany, but they are now making every effort to avoid this. At the same time, the League of Nations has another difficult problem because, according to the Associated Press from reliable sources, Austria has also launched a request to restore conscription and establish a standing army of 100,000 people. It is reported that Austria has expressed to Britain, France and Italy that unless the military clauses of the Treaty of Saint-Germain are amended, Austria will no longer be able to maintain its position. Italy, of course, agrees with this, because this move can increase the strength to resist Germany's expansion in Southern Europe. The Little Entente opposes the proposal, fearing that this move will cause Hungary and Bulgaria to demand equal treatment. Well-informed sources say that Austria's request to increase its troops is closely related to the Habsburg restoration movement. It has been learned here that the Austrian Home Guard is currently brewing a coup, with its young leader, Prince Starhemberg, as the Austrian ruler. However, this plan will probably take a peaceful approach, starting with amending the constitution. After Prince Starhemberg takes power, Archduke Otto's accession to the throne will be even closer. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Budapest - Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Gömbös said at a rally in his constituency yesterday that Germany had been demanding the issue of rearmament for many years, but because other countries did not comment on it, it took a path of self-determination to achieve its goal of equality. Hungary, as a member of the League of Nations, plans to demand equal rights, and Italy and other friendly countries are willing to help, so what it seeks can certainly be achieved. In addition to political issues, Hungary also plans to raise financial and economic issues. Countries that assume the heavy responsibility of European security should also be promoted.

<h3>Italy Increases Troops on Austrian Border, Does Not Want to Oppose Austria's Rearmament, Considers It a Bulwark Against German Southern Advance</h3>
<p>(Rome) The conflict between Italy and Abyssinia has temporarily subsided due to the tense situation in Europe. Italy has turned its attention to the north. The Associated Press learned today that Italy's mobilization plan against Germany intends to deploy a large number of troops on the Italian-Austrian border. There are currently nine regiments of troops in that area. Rome is maintaining silence on the rumors circulating in Geneva that Austria plans to triple its military strength, but it has not denied it either. Some senior officials said that Italy does not want to oppose Austria's rearmament, believing that it will create a bulwark against the development of German National Socialism in Southern Europe.

<h3>U.S. Senator Borah Observes that European War Can Be Avoided, Germany Does What It Wants by Violating the Treaty, Expects Allies to Eventually Succumb</h3>
<p>(Washington) Republican Senator Borah recently declared that the United States is not at risk of being drawn into a European conflict. Germany's rearmament is the prelude to the abolition of the Treaty of Versailles, which will help ease the European situation. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Republican Senator Borah, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee during President Hoover's era, declared today in his characteristically brief and straightforward tone, "I do not believe there is a risk of war. Germany will be able to do what it wants, and the Allies will succumb. Although the Treaty of Versailles will become a piece of waste paper, that is a good thing." As soon as these words came out, the war clouds in Europe immediately dissipated. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) During the European War, the British mail ship "Lusitania" was sunk by a German submarine, causing the deaths of many American passengers. President Wilson then declared war on Germany because of this. Recently, in view of the fact that if European countries were to start a war, this kind of thing could easily happen again, which could cause the United States to be drawn into the vortex again, the United States government is considering suspending the issuance of passports to travelers going abroad in wartime to prevent this from happening. It is also studying measures to prohibit the export of military supplies, but the general public is skeptical as to whether the prohibition of the export of military supplies can be implemented. It is believed that cotton and wheat can indeed be regarded as military supplies in modern warfare. If exports are prohibited, American farmers will inevitably strongly oppose it. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Pacific Situation is Urgent, Canada's Position, Safety Depends on Compromise between Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>(New York) Today, the New York Times editorial column published an article commenting on Canada's position in the Far East incident, saying, "The British Imperial Conference in 1921 decided not to renew the Anglo-Japanese alliance, which was due to Canada's proposal and was supported by Newfoundland and Australia. Because, from the geographical location of Canada, if a war occurs between the United States and Japan, Canada will be the only way for both sides to fight. If British policy is linked with Japan, the danger of Canada's position is unimaginable, and Canada's security depends on the compromise between Britain and the United States. Now that the United States has not joined the League of Nations, a regional collective security system should be established, that is, to continue or expand the Nine-Power Treaty, which is enough to prevent problems before they occur. As for Canada, as a British Dominion and a country along the Pacific Ocean, it should, based on the ideal of international collective action, seek to solve various problems in the Pacific Ocean by various methods. If this kind of attempt fails, Canada will also do its best to ensure that the friendly relationship between Britain and the United States is not harmed in the slightest." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Avenol's Statement: Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations Takes Effect Today; League of Nations Secretary-General Expresses Regret; Matsuoka States Japan Cannot Be Isolated</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's formal notice of withdrawal from the League of Nations, issued on March 27, 1935, takes effect tomorrow. From tomorrow onwards, all legal relations between Japan and the League of Nations will be severed. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol issued a statement here today regarding Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, stating that it is regrettable that Japan, an original member of the League, has severed its ties after fifteen years of cooperation. Now that the withdrawal is a fact, all legal relations between Japan and the League of Nations no longer exist. Japan no longer enjoys any rights or bears any obligations to the League. It is unfortunate that Japan no longer maintains its former position with regard to the League. However, we are gratified to hear that the Japanese government intends to pursue a policy of international cooperation in the spirt of the Imperial Rescript issued two years ago. We cannot say what form Japan will adopt, but personally, I have decided not to take any action that could hinder relations between Japan and the League. We cannot predict the future. I do not believe we should abandon hope for the universality of the League. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The period of advance notice for Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations concludes today. From tomorrow onwards, Japan will sever relations with the League. According to the Tokyo Newspaper, Japan's policies and attitudes after withdrawing from the League are as follows: (1) The League of Nations still refuses to recognize "Manchukuo," so Japan has decided never to return to the League. (2) Japan will not return the South Pacific Islands under mandate, because the administering country does not necessarily have to be a member of the League, but will only submit annual reports on governance. (3) Japan will participate in disarmament conferences, as their purpose is to promote world peace and reduce the burden on the people, and the US and Russia are also participating. (4) Japan will continue to participate and cooperate with the World Court and the International Labour Bureau, as their nature is independent of the League of Nations. (5) Japan will not participate in the Opium Advisory Committee, the Committee on the Traffic of Women and Children, the General Conference on Communications and Transit, the Economic Consultative Committee, the Finance Committee, the Health Committee, the Fiscal Committee, and other agencies in an official government capacity, because the League's appointment of commissioners is unfair. (China United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota declined to comment on Japan's formal withdrawal from the League of Nations today, saying that Japan wishes this day to pass quietly, without much ado. Other officials from the Foreign Ministry also declined to express their opinions, but stated that Japan will abide by the policies stipulated in the Imperial Rescript of March 1933. Observers now believe that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations is a very legitimate move, as it allows Japan to break free from the internationalism embraced by Britain and the United States. They also believe that the dangerous situation has now passed, and the political situation in the Far East is now more tranquil than last year. Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, Foreign Minister Hirota's criticism of the Washington Naval Treaty, and his conciliatory policy towards Russia have greatly increased Japan's prestige in the Far East. According to observers, the events of the past two years have made the Japanese government aware of the dangers of multilateral treaties, and it is expected that Japan will advocate bilateral agreements in the future. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will take effect at midnight on the 27th, both in name and in reality. Mr. Yosuke Matsuoka, who had been fully empowered as the chairman of the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations Council during the Sino-Japanese conflict, and who had declared Japan's withdrawal from the League on February 24, 1933, is deeply moved by this. His statement is as follows: The notice of withdrawal from the League of Nations taking effect today is merely completing the formality of withdrawing from the League. The world has known for two years that Japan was withdrawing from the League, and when the notice was issued, the Emperor granted an Imperial Rescript. The spirit of this Rescript can be said to be the aspiration of the entire Japanese nation. However, even though we are formally withdrawing, we must still cooperate with all nations for the sake of world peace, and there is no change in this. Inside or outside the League, it is all the same. Japan must not be isolated in the world, and the nations of the world will not allow Japan to be isolated, for such a move is impossible in this small world. I believe that after Japan's withdrawal, the League of Nations will only be a peace organization for Europe, and I hope that it can fulfill its function. The nations of the world, at least as of today, cannot regard the League of Nations as a global peace organization, because it has failed to fulfill its mission, and they are all aware of this. The way to safeguard world peace is to divide the world into regions and practice division of labor and cooperation. We should first safeguard peace in each region, study this path, and hold regional conferences to facilitate the exchange of views. There is no better solution than this. In short, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations may be related to fate, and in the end, it is up to the countries concerned to seek the best way forward. (Japan United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government will completely sever relations with the League of Nations at midnight on the 27th. According to a report from Consul-General Yokoyama in Geneva on the 25th to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese government's contribution to the League of Nations, amounting to 483,294.85 Swiss francs, was paid to the League of Nations Secretariat on the 9th.

<h3>Important Bills Remain Unresolved; Japanese Diet Adjourns; Minister of Agriculture Expresses Indignation, Economic Circles Disappointed; Seiyukai Criticizes Cabinet's Inability, Trouble Ahead</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The turbulent 67th Diet session has finally come to an end. The closing ceremony was held in the House of Peers at 11:00 a.m. on the 26th. Prime Minister Okada and other cabinet members, Prince Konoe, Speaker Hamada, Vice-Speaker Matsudaira, and all members of both houses attended. The Emperor did not attend in person. The Prime Minister, on Imperial command, read out the Imperial Rescript for the closing ceremony. After bowing deeply towards the Imperial Throne, he received the Imperial Rescript from the secretary and stated, "I, the Minister, have the honor of reading the Imperial Rescript for the closing ceremony on Imperial command." Amidst the deepest respects of all members, he read the gracious Imperial Rescript. Upon completion, Speaker Konoe received the Imperial Rescript, and the ceremony concluded. All members left the chamber. (Dentsu News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The eventful 67th Diet session concluded last night. The closing ceremony was held in the House of Peers today. Secretary-General Wakamiya of the Seiyukai, recalling the political battles of the past three months, expressed his impressions: "Looking back on the Diet session, I feel even more keenly the incompetence of the current cabinet. The reason why the important bills proposed by the government were not passed is because the cabinet's foundation is not based on political parties. Not extending the session to pass the Rice Control Law further demonstrates its incompetence. Therefore, the future of the cabinet is predictable." Chief Secretary Raimu of the Minseito stated that half of his time was spent dealing with the aftermath of the bomb incident, which resulted in the adjournment without completing deliberations on important rural issues, which is regrettable for the nation. We express our dissatisfaction with the achievements of this Diet session. Chief Secretary Noda of the Kokumin Domei told reporters that the current cabinet's poor performance in the Diet is due to the fact that the cabinet members are not suited to a time when the entire nation should be united, so it is no surprise that they have not achieved good results. Even if they continue to shamelessly remain in power, they will inevitably collapse soon. However, political parties should also fundamentally reform at this time to prepare for the future of the Diet. Member of the Research Society, Oka Buchikageko, told reporters that the fact that all important bills were shelved is evidence of the weakness of the cabinet, which is due to the government's lack of firm beliefs and its failure to engage in compromise with political parties. Unless the current cabinet undergoes major reform, it will be difficult for it to continue until the next Diet session. (Dentsu News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) With the Diet adjourning without completing deliberations on important bills related to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the question of Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki's resignation and Prime Minister Okada's political responsibility has become the focus of attention. The government will now devote its full efforts to realizing the Cabinet Deliberation Council and recruiting influential figures from various sectors to compensate for the authority lost in the Diet. Whether it can be established and its capabilities will not only affect the current cabinet, but also have a significant impact on Japan's political structure. Another difficult issue for the government in this Diet session was the aftermath of the so-called Emperor Organ Theory. Although discussions in the Diet have been completed, the external opposition movement is becoming increasingly fierce. If the method of resolution is not appropriate, unexpected waves will occur in the political world, which is predictable. In short, optimism is not warranted for the future of the government, which revealed its weaknesses in the Diet, and the Seiyukai. (Japan United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) With the Diet session not extended and the bills related to rice control shelved, Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki expressed considerable indignation. Last night, he told reporters that the reason why the session was not extended was because the government did not consider it necessary, but the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is in great difficulty. Rural policies cannot be implemented as a result, and even if we are criticized by the world, it cannot be helped. The aftermath cannot be easily discussed, but this is only the Minister of Agriculture's responsibility and should be borne by the entire cabinet. (Dentsu News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the economic circles generally expected that the economic-related bills would be completely defeated, the fact that the Diet adjourned in this way has caused a great shock, leaving them disappointed. (Japan United Press, 26th)</p>
<h3>New Belgian Cabinet Formed; Prime Minister Theunis Concurrently Serves as Foreign Minister; Currency Policy to Implement Devaluation; Advocate Restoring Diplomatic Relations with Russia</h3>
<p>Brussels: The Vice-Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, Theunis, announced last night that the formation of the cabinet was completed. It is reported that the new cabinet will be composed of the Catholic, Liberal, and Socialist parties. Theunis will concurrently serve as Foreign Minister. The previous cabinet of Prime Minister de Broqueville was overthrown due to strong opposition to its fiscal policies. Therefore, the public is eagerly awaiting the new cabinet's formal announcement of its position on maintaining the gold standard. It is likely that Theunis will oppose reducing the value of the Belgian franc. However, as the Socialist party, which supports devaluation, is participating in the cabinet, it is difficult to predict what will happen. Business leaders generally support devaluation, while the banking sector and the government generally oppose it. (National News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Brussels: The new cabinet has now been formed with the following personnel: "Prime Minister and Foreign Minister" Theunis (Catholic Party, new appointment), "Minister without Portfolio" Vandervelde (Socialist Party, incumbent), Hymans (Liberal Party, former Foreign Minister), de Broqueville (Catholic Party, former Minister of Interior), "Minister of National Defense" Devèze (Catholic Party, incumbent), "Minister of Finance" Max-Leo Gérard (Liberal Party, new appointment), "Minister of Colonies" Rubbens (Catholic Party, former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs), "Minister of Education" Bovesse (Liberal Party, former Minister of Justice), "Minister of Economic Affairs" Isaac (Catholic Party, incumbent), "Minister of Interior" Ziwa Nave (Catholic Party, former Minister of Transportation), "Minister of Justice" Soudan (Socialist Party, new appointment), "Minister of Transportation" Spaak (Socialist Party, new appointment), "Minister of Public Works" de Man (Socialist Party, new appointment), "Minister of Labor" Troclet (Socialist Party, new appointment). (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Among the fifteen members of the new cabinet formed today, there are six from the Catholic Party, four from the Liberal Party, and five from the Socialist Party. Among the Socialist Party members, there are Vandervelde, a leader of the Second International, and de Man, an economist famous for creating a rationalization plan. The new Prime Minister, Theunis, made a cautious statement regarding currency policy, refraining from making any definitive statements. Therefore, it is possible that the new cabinet will implement currency devaluation. The new cabinet's domestic policy aims to control banking operations, implement the conversion of public debt interest, and reduce working hours for laborers. In foreign policy, it will restore diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. Theunis will also strive to stabilize the international situation, realize an international monetary standard system, and reduce barriers to relations. As for restricting import quotas, it will oppose them. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>New Conflict in East Africa; Italy Protests to Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Rome) Relations between Italy and Abyssinia have become even more tense due to another conflict in East Africa. According to news received here today, an Italian deputy brigade commander, accompanied by a local junior officer, encountered 400 armed Abyssinian soldiers near Womagh this morning. The Italian officer ordered the Abyssinian soldiers to withdraw from Italian territory, but they refused. The Italian officer then drew his pistol and shot and killed one Abyssinian soldier, and the rest retreated. The Italian government has now lodged a protest with Abyssinia regarding this incident and is demanding compensation for the losses. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Abyssinian Legation issued a communiqué, stating that the Abyssinian government is committed to peace and that Abyssinian troops have not concentrated along the border of Italian East Africa. It also stated that the outstanding issues between Italy and Abyssinia will be resolved peacefully. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Old Religious Customs Gradually Eliminated; Turkey's Westernization; Abolition of Friday Sabbath; Changed to Sunday Rest</h3>
<p>Angora: The Westernization of the new Turkey is still proceeding rapidly. The last vestiges of the old etiquette with religious characteristics are now being gradually eliminated. Recently, the government issued another reform decree, namely, Turkey used to follow the Islamic custom of taking Friday as the Sabbath, but now it will be changed to Sunday, making the lives of the Turkish people consistent with those of European and American countries.

The price trended lower after opening, and only returned to the opening price at 2:00 p.m., which was $4.78125.</p>
<p>British-French: The French exchange rate opened at 72.53 francs, fell to 73.40 francs, but later returned to 72.50 francs, which is the most recent price.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>American Cotton: The New York cotton market opened slightly higher. Although there were not many transactions, the rising trend continued. The spot situation remained strong, and there was still talk of inflation in the market. The Northeast weather report indicated that preparations for cotton fields are currently suspended. Indian and Bombay cotton markets fell slightly today due to selling by Japanese merchants and poor Liverpool telegrams. The market closed weaker, with the price for April-May at 220.25 rupees, down 25.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market was calm today, and sentiment was somewhat weaker. At 1:00 p.m., the price for the May contract was 6.24, down 4 pounds.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market rose slightly today. At 1:00 p.m., the price for the May contract rose 375 to 5 shillings and 2.25 pence.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The Chicago wheat market opened stable, with prices rising slightly, expressing sympathy for overseas market conditions. The market sentiment became firmer after the rubber price increased, and the price continued to rise. Eastern demand was good, and it was reported that the drought in the southwestern wheat region had not been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: This morning, the London rubber market adopted a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting the resolution of the International Rubber Regulation Committee. The opening was quiet, and prices did not move, but later became slightly more stable. At noon, the price for the July-September contract was 5.4375 pence, up 0.0625.</p>
<p>New York: Today, the rubber market was the focus of attention for general merchants. Before the opening, the news was received that the Rubber Regulation Committee stipulated that the quotas for April, May, June and July were set at 70%, and the other months were at 65%. This news was favorable to the bulls. At the opening, merchants competed to buy, and the momentum was frantic, causing prices to rise by 100 pounds higher than yesterday. After a slight pause, the price rose again half an hour after the opening, and the market situation was quite firm. With the rubber market showing signs of improvement, other commodities also became firm and stable.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: There was very little news of interest on Wall Street today. Securities opened quietly and unevenly, with prices mostly unchanged. The Dow Jones 30 Stock Average opened at 99.56, up 6 pounds. Copper mining stocks are expected to rise in price today due to the prospect of copper production restrictions. The remaining stock prices hardly changed today. The New York securities market prices are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Major Dust Bowl Disaster in Western US; Tens of Thousands of Acres of Farmland Affected; Many Farmers Abandon Their Homes and Relocate</h3>
<p>Kansas: The plains of the western United States are suffering from a dust bowl disaster, and this year's harvest is feared to be unusually poor, which is rare in the past. The number of acres of farmland affected in Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, and Oklahoma is unknown, but farmers have abandoned their homes and relocated, and many livestock have also died. According to statisticians from the Department of Labor, the losses are in the millions, and tens of millions of acres in southeastern Colorado may not be suitable for farmland or pasture for the next hundred years.

<h3>Northwestern Inspection Report</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ya</p>
<p>Gold and Silver Mines of Ejin and Alxa</p>
<p>The plains of Andunyu are vast and boundless. The verse from Meng Haoran's poem, "The wilderness vast, the sky low, the trees," is truly a depiction of this place. However, upon entering Jialue Pass, the scenery is completely different.</p>
<p>The southern mountains of Jiuquan are the highest peak of the Qilian Mountains. Snow accumulates year-round and does not melt, commonly referred to as the Heavenly Mountains. In summer, the red sun shines brightly, and the melting snow irrigates the fields, as beneficial as a water channel. Hence, there is a saying that even without rain throughout the year, a bountiful harvest can be achieved. However, according to my friend Liu Xiaoquan, "During the great drought in Gansu and Shaanxi in the seventeenth and eighteenth years of the Republic of China, starving people dug up grass roots and peeled tree bark, cooking them together with leather to barely sustain themselves. The wealthy bought steamed buns, fearing they would be snatched by the starving, and would spit on them without concern for cleanliness. Starving corpses were left unburied, and beggars would carry corpses to merchants' shops, refusing to leave unless given food. Selling daughters was common, but initially there were buyers, but later no one cared. Those who initially bought daughters later sought to sell themselves but could not. The various tragic scenes are too unbearable to fully describe. Jiuquan, being in the same disaster area, was no exception." Therefore, the saying of a bountiful harvest without rain is an exaggeration. In recent years, rainfall has been slightly better, but when asking the farmers, the answer is still unanimously "drought." One farmer even said, "During the great famine, we swore that if we were lucky enough to survive, even if we had to beg for food, we would eat one less mouthful each day to save some food in preparation for another disaster. Who knew that in recent years, Heaven has not blessed us with much rain, and it is still difficult to even have thin millet porridge. Not to mention anything else, just look at this cold weather, and we are still wearing these clothes. Besides, there is also..." At this point, the conversation abruptly stopped. It seems they are suffering not only from "drought" but also from "taxes." Therefore, to alleviate the suffering of the farmers, it is essential to actively repair water conservancy and passively abolish exorbitant taxes. Both are extremely crucial, and this is not limited to just one county.</p>
<p>Wei Yunzhi, the magistrate of Jiuquan County, said that the Northwest is rich in treasures and the people are honest and simple. Although it is said that the culture is backward, it is not without solutions. The most concerning issue is the increasingly serious border crisis. In areas north of Jiuquan, such as Weiyuan City and Pingshu Camp in the Ejin Torghut banner, foreigners often disguised as Mongols, speaking the Mongolian language, travel back and forth to scout and inquire. They also present gifts such as tea bricks and silk to the princes to curry favor, which seems suspicious. Yu Dianfen, the director of the Jiuquan station of the Xin Sui Automobile Company, who was present, also said that on the company's routes through the Mongolian grasslands, similar situations are indeed often seen. Regarding the border situation and mineral resources of Ejin, according to those familiar with the matter, the following is said:</p>
<p>From the northwest of Ejin to the Malimenzhade Mountain, it borders the Hooqin Torghut. This mountain rises steeply for twenty li and has a Bodhisattva temple, called Darik by the Mongols, which is the name of the Bodhisattva. The mountain is about three hundred li from the Ejin Wangfu (Prince's Residence). Several dozen li past this mountain is the Beizi (minor prince) residence of the Hooqin Torghut. From Hooqin to Altai, it is about one thousand and several hundred li. Passing Ejin, there is an endless plain with many springs, fertile land, and a mild climate, similar to Ningxia and Gansu. The locals grow highland barley and there are abundant mineral resources, especially gold. In the Juyanhai Lake in the northwest of Ejin, several rivers flow in, and the Weak River of Gansu (i.e., the Shandan River) also flows into it. The lake is one hundred and several tens of li in circumference, and the water does not overflow, but flows underground for thousands of li until it reaches the Altai border northwest of Hooqin Torghut, where it flows out and becomes a huge river, flowing northwest. There is a large silver mine in Alxa, about a thousand li northwest of Dingyuan, which takes eleven days to reach. It is called the Kala Zeng Huzha Mountain. The mine is about fifty li from east to west and thirty li from north to south. The quality of the silver ore produced is excellent. During the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty, a Mr. Su from Gulang, Gansu, mined it once with a capital of over ten thousand, but using old methods for two years only covered the capital. In the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu, his son Su Chao gathered shares again, but both times, due to the distance of the required water and firewood, making transportation inconvenient, the operation was stopped. Now, with automobile transportation of water and firewood, it is more convenient than before, and using Western mining methods will surely yield substantial profits. Forty li away from this mountain, there is a kind of firewood called Zhagechai by the Mongols, which can burn even when wet and is specially used for smelting silver. The territory of the Zhasaktu Khan of Outer Mongolia was originally not large, but now it is mistakenly marked as part of that banner on maps in many places. Currently, wealthy Mongols from the Zhasaktu Khan who are avoiding communism have fled to Alxa and Ejin, each with several hundred households.</p>
<p>About a hundred li from Jiuquan City, there are stones produced in the mountains, some as large as a dou (unit of volume) and some as small as a fist, with fine texture and beautiful colors. They are called Suzhou stones. Stone craftsmen carve them into utensils such as wine cups, bracelets, and pen holders. Their colors include yellow-red, black-green, milky white, and various mixed colors. The luster is beautiful and jade-like. Local people use them as gifts for distant guests, and those who receive them are all delighted. There is a large Buddhist temple in the county, with two notable items: one is a large pot for cooking porridge for a thousand people, and the other is a stone vase that can hold a hundred flowers, which are renowned far and wide.</p>
<p>Traveling to Zhangye (Ganzhou), the car broke down at Twenty Li Fort and stopped for repairs for a day. The next day, wanting to reach Wuwei (Liangzhou), they got up in the middle of the night to pack. Outside the inn, ox carts rumbled one after another, attracted by the electric light of the car, forming groups of three or five to watch. The reporter went up to talk to them. At first, they hesitated to speak, but later they spoke freely without restraint. According to them, "In the villages of this county, rainfall and snowfall are timely, and on average, one shi (unit of volume) of millet sown can yield six shi. The price of grain is usually five or six yuan per shi, but when the new grain is harvested, taxes are pressing, and everyone rushes to sell in the city, selling only two yuan per shi. Those from villages farther from the city who come to sell grain either travel overnight to return on the same day or stay overnight in the suburbs because they cannot return, enduring hunger and cold, all to save a little money. Unfortunately, they often encounter gamblers who drag them away to gamble, losing everything. Alas, these days farmers shouldn't have any money anyway." When asked why the magistrate doesn't ban gambling, they replied that gambling is not banned during the Lunar New Year and the donkey and horse fairs. The donkey and horse fair is during the autumn harvest and is supposed to be for people to buy and sell donkeys and horses, but in reality, everyone openly gambles for dozens of days. If they lose and don't pay, they can report to the Public Security Bureau. People from distant villages also go to set up gambling stalls, but if no one enters, the village chief and headman have to maintain order or offer travel expenses to invite them to other villages. The magistrate of a certain county once issued a ban on gambling after the fair, but the gamblers moved the gambling stalls in front of the county government, so rampant was their power, naturally relying on the army," and so on. Later, in Wuwei, it was indeed heard that Ma Buqing's division had banned gambling, which shows that what the farmers said was not false.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Vigorously Implements New Policies; Chengdu, Chongqing, and Wanxian Three Cities Strive for Reform; All Inland Tax Bureaus Completely Abolished</h3>
<p>Chongqing dispatch: This time when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek visited Chongqing, he was very serious about the various reform movements in Sichuan. Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, and general administrative personnel have been especially diligent in promoting them. Currently, the three major cities of Chongqing, Chengdu, and Wanxian have been completely transformed, presenting a new and rising atmosphere. The recent reforms in these three major cities are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Smoking</p>
<p>Since March, all opium dens in Chongqing City have been eliminated, and the number of opium pipes confiscated has reached five or six thousand. Opium addicts in the two cities of Jiangbei and Bachi are required to completely quit within this month. Those who do not comply with the regulations or have not quit by the deadline will be punished for disobeying orders. All stores selling opium quitting pills are experiencing a tenfold increase in sales. In order to prevent opportunistic merchants from profiting, the authorities have specially organized chemical tests by the Health Committee to prevent them from mixing in toxic substances and harming society. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was also requested to send a telegram to Liu Ruiheng, the Director of the National Health Administration and Chairman of the Opium Prohibition Committee, urgently requesting him to send trustworthy and reliable personnel to Sichuan to handle the opium quitting work in Sichuan Province. It is heard that after receiving the telegram, Liu is in the process of selecting personnel, and they are expected to arrive in Sichuan around the end of the month. The cities of Chengdu and Wanxian are also working hard on the opium prohibition movement, and it is expected to be completed in the shortest possible time. According to news from important officials of the Provincial Government, the chairman deeply hates the people's opium smoking and has made a firm determination to require all addicts in Sichuan Province to quit opium this year, otherwise the responsible officials in each locality will be punished without leniency.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Police Administration</p>
<p>The Provincial Government believes that the three cities of Rong (Chengdu), Yu (Chongqing), and Wanxian are located at important land and water transportation hubs, with a mix of Chinese and foreigners, and are the focus of attention both at home and abroad. Therefore, public security matters should be specially reorganized in order to correct perceptions and establish a good reputation. It has specially presented five key points to the three cities of Rong, Yu, and Wanxian, urging them to intensify their efforts. The key points are as follows: (1) Cleanliness of clothing. Whether or not the clothing is clean is the best indication of the diligence or laziness of the police officers and is related to the entire police administration. Therefore, the clothing worn by the police must be neat and clean, and no negligence is allowed, so as not to affect appearances. (2) Eliminating the old and weak. Since the police are responsible for serving society and leading the general public, they must be energetic and serious in attitude in order to be competent in their duties. All those who are old and weak, lack energy, or are addicted to bad habits should be immediately eliminated and replaced with strong and well-trained personnel. (3) Maintaining traffic. Maintaining traffic is one of the basic tasks of the police and is very important as it relates to social order and safety. Therefore, various methods must be used to guide the traffic of various vegetable carriers, sedan chairs, and vehicles, so that they travel according to the prescribed routes, so as not to hinder traffic. Police booths must also be set up at wider intersections to facilitate police officers in directing traffic. (4) Cleaning the streets. Health is the mother of career success, and cleanliness is essential for health. Upon investigation, the main roads in various cities are generally clean, but the streets and alleys are often filled with garbage and are extremely dirty. This is due to the lack of cleanliness among the people, but also due to the dereliction of duty by the police. In the future, regardless of sunny or rainy weather, heat or cold, all levels of officials must personally inspect the streets, wells, ponds, ditches, toilets, food, and items. If any uncleanliness is found, it must be immediately prohibited or guided for correction. (5) Improving toilets. It is found that the cleanliness of toilets is of great importance to the public health of citizens. In the past, due to poor construction and the people's non-compliance with the law, people would defecate and urinate at will outside the toilets, and the foul odor spread everywhere, causing pedestrians to cover their noses. Now that summer is approaching, there are especially many diseases. Ways should be found to improve the toilets and conduct serious inspections to curb the source of disease. Yesterday, a special order was issued to change the Public Security Office of the Chongqing Garrison Command to the Public Security Bureau, appointing Fan Chongshi as the director and urging him to immediately take office, strictly enforce the regulations, and correct perceptions. Fan has already taken office that day and is implementing reforms.</p>
<p>Abolishing Tax Bureaus</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Provincial Government, all old taxes and levies in Sichuan Province have been abolished, and a single tax system is implemented. The Sichuan Provincial Local Tax Bureau is established in Chongqing, the Local Tax Sub-bureau is established in Wanxian, and Local Tax Collection Offices are established in counties bordering other provinces, such as Yibin, Jiangjin, Hejiang, Gongjiang, and Nanchuan. All other inland tax bureaus are abolished. The Chenghua, Hechuan, and Fuling County Tax Bureaus, the Fuhe Merchant Protection Office, and the Jiangna Collection Office are immediately stopped from collecting taxes and are required to close down within a time limit. The original telegram stated, "Upon investigation, all old taxes and levies in Sichuan Province have been abolished, and a Provincial Local Tax Bureau is established in Chongqing, a Local Tax Sub-bureau is established in Wanxian, and Local Tax Collection Offices are established in counties bordering other provinces, such as Jiangjin, Yibin, Hejiang, Gongnan, Fengwu, Youxiu, Peng, etc., and a single tax system is implemented, which have been ordered separately and telegraphed to the county bureaus for compliance. It is now found that the Chenghua, Hechuan, Fuling, Luxian, and Jiading Tax Bureaus, the Fuhe Merchant Protection Office, the Jiangna Collection Office, as well as the Neijiang Sugar Tax, the concurrent handling of merchant prohibition of opium, and the merchant protection and opium suppression investigation office in Fushun, the merchant protection part, are all located in the inland of Sichuan Province and there is no need to establish them. They should be abolished immediately and stopped collecting taxes by the afternoon of March 20th of this year. The matter of knowing how to levy taxes on goods and packages transported to neighboring provinces shall be taken over by the county tax collection bureau, except for Chengdu, and one or two staff members for handling neighboring transportation shall be retained and sent to the tax bureau for supervision. In addition to paying the salaries of the officials and staff of the office at all levels who have left their posts this time, a one-month gratuity will also be given to show concern. You are required to comply with the instructions and forward them to your subordinates for compliance, and report the compliance situation for verification." In addition, the Sichuan Provincial Government has recently determined that during the period of bandit suppression, the intelligence of public officials should be improved urgently in order to achieve maximum efficiency in a short period of time. It is planning to establish a training class for public officials, gathering administrative personnel from various counties for training. This method is currently being discussed by the Department of Civil Affairs, using the public official training regulations promulgated by the Central Government as a guideline.</p>
<h3>Shandong Telephone Network Completed</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The province's long-distance telephone network, which has been actively constructed by the Department of Construction for the past three years, has largely completed the connection of all provincial and county long-distance telephones. Only the counties of Yanpu, Wendeng, and Rongcheng are still in progress, and construction will begin recently, scheduled to be completed by the end of April. The entire provincial telephone network can be connected. In the future, the Department of Construction will seek to improve and reorganize the province-owned telephones, and make the county-owned telephones more widespread in rural areas. The Long-Distance Telephone Management Office is now ordered to edit a three-year work report statistics and the Long-Distance Telephone Chronicle. The general situation of long-distance telephones and the subsequent reorganization plan are recorded below separately.</p>
<p>Province-Owned Telephones</p>
<p>The province-owned telephones in the province are divided into seven major trunk lines, namely Jinan-Qingdao, Jinan-Tai'an-Tengzhou, Jinan-Dong'a-Jinan, Jinan-Liaocheng, Jinan-Dezhou, Jinan-Hui, and Jinan-Yi. Its administrative area is divided into five districts: Jinan-Dong'a, Jinan-Wu, Lai, Jinan-Yi, and Jinan-Cao. There are 116 telephone bureaus and 19 agency offices. The total length of the lines is 14,612 li, of which 4,676 li are copper wires and 9,945 li are iron wires. The total length of the wires is 17,892 li. There are 288 telephones, 110 switchboards, and 120 long-distance machines. In addition, there are three submarine cables from Putai to Boxing, Luokou, and Dong'a, as well as a Hojia Liu water line.</p>
<p>County-Owned Telephones</p>
<p>County-owned telephones belong to each county and are managed by the Department of Construction. Each county has a long-distance telephone office. The total length of the county-owned telephone network in the province is 5,691 li. Together with the existing lines, the total length is 30,378 li, with 39,837 li of overhead wires. There are a total of 2,963 telephones. All villages and towns can directly communicate with the county, and can also be connected to the province-owned telephones.</p>
<p>Business Situation</p>
<p>Since the telephones in the province are divided into province-owned and county-owned, the revenue is also divided into province-owned and county-owned. The payment is made once a month, which is a zero-payment method. The monthly revenue is around 40,000 yuan. During the peak business season, it can reach more than 50,000 yuan, while in the off-season, it ranges from 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Of this, accounting takes up two-thirds. It is estimated that after the establishment of the Wendeng County Telephone Bureau, its revenue can be more than doubled, because the coastal areas will be connected to various counties in the future, and its telecommunications business will naturally be busy.</p>
<p>Reorganization Plan</p>
<p>Now that the entire provincial telephone network has been completed, the Department of Construction and the Long-Distance Telephone Management Office are focusing on reorganizing the province-owned and county-owned telephones. The reorganization plan is as follows: (1) Reorganizing the telephone poles on each line, starting with the counties in southern Shandong. All existing telephone poles that are too short or rotten will be replaced with Sha wood poles with a diameter of 5 inches at the top and 7 inches at the bottom. (2) Each county's county government will supervise the people's corps and the united village associations to be responsible for protecting the line poles. The village near the province-owned telephones will be responsible by the county government. If there is any loss, the village will be responsible. The county government's Fourth Section will order each village to be responsible for the county-owned telephones. This method has been implemented in all counties.</p>
<h3>Hua County, Henan Province, Appeals for Relief for Disaster Victims; Providing Disaster-Stricken Children and Women with Work as a Long-Term Relief Measure</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The flood in Hua County, Henan Province, has caused widespread disaster to the people. Xie Suian, the magistrate of the county, and others have recently sent a telegram to the Shanghai Drought Relief Association, appealing for relief. The telegram stated: "Unfortunately, Hua County has suffered repeatedly from war and famine, leaving ten houses empty of nine. Refugees are everywhere. The Relief Institute was established in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The poor and helpless gathered at the news, but due to the small amount of funds, it was difficult to accommodate many people. Therefore, we divided the areas and strictly admitted people. Within a day, the old, weak, and disabled who were admitted to the hospital numbered over eighty. They had no clothes or food, and the tragic situation was indescribable. We were planning to raise funds from various sources and勉强勉强(mian qiang): barely/forcefully sustain them with amaranth and糟糠糟糠 (zao kang): chaff and bran to prolong their remaining lives. Who knew that the heavens would not have mercy, and the Yellow River has flooded for years, and the eastern half of Hua County is sighing about becoming fish food. The fields are completely gone, regardless of whether they are poor or rich households, and the water fills the entire area. We only hear the sound of crying and the sound of water, and there is no time to count those who have become wave fodder and buried in the belly of fish. And those who were lying in collapsed houses, rescued by boat boards, perched on tall trees, jumped into the water and swam, and thus escaped, are estimated to be more than 100,000 people. They eat in the wind and sleep in the dew, only stretching their necks to cry. They break their hearts and pierce their eyes, only gazing at the ocean and sighing. When they see people asking for help, they only shed tears and bow their heads. They beg along the villages, but who can take off their clothes and share their food? They are lucky to have saved a life and avoided becoming drowning ghosts, but who knows that a moment later they will become starving corpses. It is painful to speak of, and those who hear it are heartbroken. Alas, how much ancestral misfortune has our Hua people suffered, that they have suffered such a heavy and tragic calamity? At the end of the lunar year, we were fortunate to have your association come to Henan to provide relief and allocate 20,000 yuan to Hua for relief, which was distributed in full. The surviving remnants were able to prolong their remaining lives. However, because the number of disaster victims is large, the distribution is difficult to cover. The remainder are still displaced and wandering, with the ditches and ravines in sight. And the most painful of these is that the young and strong have drowned, leaving only frail old men and women. Fathers and brothers have drifted away, leaving only young girls and children crying alone, with no relatives to look up to. The Relief Institute can hardly sit idly by and not admit them. In addition, last year Hu, the general manager of the Zhengzhou Youth Association, came to Hua to inspect the disaster and witnessed the tragic situation. He raised 1,000 yuan to set up a women and children's training home to accommodate 200 disaster-stricken women and children. The funds have been雏雏 (chu chu): budding/preliminary dissolved and they have no home to return to. Among them, the most miserable and pitiful ones were allocated 30 to the Relief Institute. What we lament is that the funds are too small and have never been enough. After the great disaster, income has decreased even more. The number of people has increased, but the amount of money has decreased. Not to mention buying equipment and engaging in production, it is difficult to even maintain two meals of thin porridge. Suian and others racked their brains and made a concrete plan to have the disaster-stricken children reclaim the wasteland in the fourth district of Hua County and learn carpentry and mud work. The disaster-stricken women learn weaving and straw hat braiding. We raise funds for the construction of thatched houses, the purchase of agricultural tools and livestock, and industrial equipment. It is estimated that we need 5,000 yuan. So that the old and weak can engage in profitable work. With this 5,000 yuan as a fund, we use the interest they generate to save their remaining lives. So that the relief money will not be wasted and the relief can be long-lasting. However, Suian and others have empty宏宏 (hong): grand/great ambitions and have not量薄量薄 (liang bao): measure thin strength. They lack the technique of點金點金 (dian jin): alchemy/turning into gold and sigh at the屋頂屋頂(wu ding): roof. We have always admired your association for your compassion and your care for all. We are now planning agricultural relief to补救补救 (bu jiu): repair/remedy/make up for spring耕耕 (geng): plowing. We earnestly beseech you to generously解解 (jie): understand/untie/ explain the仁囊仁囊 (ren nang): benevolent bag/donation bag and擎擎 (qing): lift/hold up this善举善举 (shan ju): charitable act. Please allocate 5,000 yuan to support this endeavor. Then the鲫鲫 (ji): crucian carp in the涸辙涸辙 (he zhe): dry tracks will be庆庆 (qing): celebrate their苏苏 (su): revive/recover. And the海海 (hai): sea of孽孽 (nie): sin/evil people can sail the航航 (hang): voyage of 慈爱慈爱 (ci ai): love/affection/compassion to彼岸彼岸 (bi an): the other shore.

<h3>Jiangsu Merchants Association Requests Suspension of New Regulations on House Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial General Chamber of Commerce, regarding the new regulations on house tax in Jiangsu Province, telegraphed the National and Provincial governments on the 23rd based on the opinions of the chambers of commerce in various counties, requesting a suspension of implementation and a return to the old regulations. The original telegram is as follows: "To Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of Nanjing; Kong, Minister of Finance; Chen, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang; Yu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs; Zhao, Director of the Department of Finance; and the Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee: We have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from the chambers of commerce of Yixing, Zhenjiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Qingpu, Gaoyou, Fengxian, Taicang, and Wujiang, stating that the Provincial Government meeting passed a new chapter on the collection of house tax in various counties on February 26 of this year, arbitrarily changing the donation rate and increasing the burden on the local government, and requesting to strive for its abolition in order to alleviate the people's suffering. At the meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the affiliated association on the 21st of this month, the opinions were collected and it was unanimously agreed that since the house tax in Jiangsu Province is the funding for each county, and the province and counties are both local governments, each has its own system. Even if there is a change in history or an increase is necessary, it should be discussed publicly by the county in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Provisional Law on Central Supervision of Local Finance before being presented to the province for a decision, which is in accordance with legal procedures and also shows solemnity. Jiangsu Province is close to the capital and guards the central government. How should it show special respect for the regulations of the central government and set an example for other provinces and become a local model? How can the Jiangsu authorities, who have always been known for their virtuousness, disregard the central government's clear regulations and summarily pass them through a provincial government meeting? Previously, it was reported that at a meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee, the Director of the Department of Finance attended and reported that the house tax donation rate was the highest standard, and the actual collection in the future would be determined based on the needs of each county. This time, it is only to整理整理 (zheng li): arrange/sort out/reorganize and统一统- (tong yi): unify/harmonize the names and standardize the tax rate, and it is not to increase the people's burden. We should虚虚 (xu): modest/false/empty纳纳 (na): accept suggestions from all parties. This shows that the Jiangsu authorities respect the central government's regulations and重视重视 (zhong shi): value/attach importance to local public opinion. Why dare we have any objections? In accordance with Article 7 of the Provisional Law on Central Supervision of Local Finance, local governments at all levels shall not implement any changes in tax items, increases or decreases in tax rates, or raising of public debts without approval in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of this law, and shall not be included in the budget. According to Article 2 of the Provincial Government Organization Law, the provincial government may issue provincial orders and formulate provincial single-line regulations and rules for provincial administrative matters within the scope of not conflicting with central laws and regulations, but regarding restricting people's freedom and increasing people's burden, it shall not be implemented without the approval of the National Government. Self-implemented is not allowed. This is with regard to central laws and regulations and should be abolished to show respect, and this is the first reason. It was reported that the person in charge of the Department of Finance said that the new chapter on house tax in the province is entirely based on the local income set by the central government. The counties have sent telegrams and inquiries, all saying that they have not seen the明文明文 (ming wen): written rules. As for the central government's principle of整顿整顿 (zheng dun): consolidate/rectify/reorganize taxes in various provinces, this only refers to固有固有 (gu you): inherent/established taxes. If the tax item has been changed and the donation rate has increased, it is not another new tax, but it is no longer within the scope of整顿整顿 (zheng dun): consolidate/rectify/reorganize. Regardless of whether Article 2 of the new章程章程 (zhang cheng): regulations/rules of the 苏苏 (su): revive/recover省订房捐苏省订房捐(Su Sheng ding fang juan): Jiangsu Province's house tax章程章程 (zhang cheng): regulations/rules 明明 (ming): 明明 (ming)明 (ming)：clearly/explicitly states that those who have not办办 (ban): do/manage it should办办 (ban): do/manage it uniformly, so it cannot be said that it is not increasing the people's burden.

<h3>Inspection of Various Counties Along the Huai River: Desolate Scenery North of Qingjiang and Stagnant Customs; Bandits Rampant in Huai'an, Lian'shui, Yancheng and Other Counties</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: Zhao Dihua, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, and Shen Baixian, Director of the Department of Construction, along with Zhu Ping, Director of the Provincial Land Bureau, and Li Jixin, a member of the Reclamation Design Committee, and a dozen others, departed for northern Jiangsu on the 13th of this month to inspect the Huai River guiding project and the supervised reclamation area. This reporter went to Qingjiangpu on business and traveled together with them. What I saw and heard is recorded below:</p>
<p>Jiangsu is known as the wealthy region of Southeast China. People living along the Yangtze River, traveling between Beijing and Shanghai, see fields and forests as dense as tents, and bustling towns and cities with merchants. They believe Jiangsu deserves its reputation. However, once one steps into the northern Jiangsu area, the impression fades. South of Gaobao still retains some of the Jiangnan atmosphere, but north of Huai'an is completely different. North of Qingjiangpu, the scenery is utterly desolate, like heaven and earth compared to Jiangnan. The old course of the Huai River, after the Yellow River moved south, was silted up and shifted northward, burying the Huai River's flow path. Yellow sand stretches for miles, the north wind roars furiously, and one cannot distinguish objects a few steps away. We inspected the land and found that the people along the Huai River guiding area struggled for drinking water, let alone irrigation. The car bumped along on the levee. Trees are scarce south of the Huai River, and north of the Huai River, there is barren white land (alkalinity not removed) everywhere. The further northeast the journey, the more difficult the lives of the people become. The car stopped at the boundary between Funing and Lianshui counties. We saw that in the countryside, five or six out of ten children had trachoma or scabies. When the wind blew their hair, nineteen out of ten had lice eggs in rows. Girls seven years old and above had already bound feet. The backwardness can be imagined. The chief engineer of the Huai River guiding project, Mr. Ge Hanlou, said that the success of guiding the Huai River would not only eliminate the water volume of Hongze Lake, but also introduce fresh water for irrigation. The desolate scene of today can be transformed into a fertile area like Jiangnan in the future.</p>
<p>Funing is the largest county in northern Jiangsu. According to recent surveys, it has about ten million mu of land. The area of ten counties such as Chuansha in Jiangnan is not comparable to its size. Yancheng County also has six million mu of land, but less than one-third of it has been reclaimed. For this Huai River guiding project, Funing should provide 25,000 laborers. According to County Magistrate Zhang, 21,000 laborers have already arrived and are still being recruited. It is expected that the quota will be exceeded by the end of the month. Yancheng's quota is 15,000, and 11,000 have already arrived. Looking at all the counties, from the county government to the township chiefs, all their energy and financial resources are concentrated on the Huai River guiding project. For counties with smaller populations, such as Jiangyan, Taixing, Gaoyou, etc., funds have been provided, or labor or machinery are used, and the engineering office can handle it themselves, which saves even more time. Last year, the counties had different methods, but after a meeting in the province this spring, they have been changed and standardized. In addition to conducting on-site inspections of the construction sites, Zhao and Shen also went to Funing, Jiancheng, Dongtai, and other counties to discuss implementation with the county government and local figures, and to solve specific problems such as bank loans, food regulation, public security, and hygiene. In order to explore other aspects, the reporter asked local people in each place, in addition to talking with the county magistrate, to inquire about everything from an objective perspective. The main points are as follows: (1) The most serious problem in Funing is bandits. Its northern district borders Xiangshui County, with land like a belt, penetrating into the coast, too far from the county seat, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. It can be said to be a "three no-care" zone. If the police brigade is slightly weak, it will be threatened by bandits. People are wary of bandits, not only travelers are cautious, but also merchants in the counter also need to have inserted guns in the waist when trading with people. The day after the reporter passed Gangshang Town in Jiancheng, there was news that bandits resisted arrest and were shot dead. (2) In Jianyin, Lianshui, Funing, and other counties, there are tens of thousands of guns scattered among the people in each county, but they still feel insufficient to defend against bandits, and the bandit problem is worrying. (3) There are more than ten million mu of wasteland in the counties. Funing Huacheng Reclamation Company has 600,000 mu of land, which can become a county, but less than one-third of it has been reclaimed. There are 6 million mu of saline land, but only about 3 million mu are taxed. Land east of Fantai and low-lying land in the lake are not subject to taxation. (4) The sea is shifting eastward, and the salinity of the land is decreasing, but the central government still requires the old salt producers to produce salt at the same amount as before. Those who produced ten catties a year can now only produce three catties, which is not enough for food and clothing. On the one hand, private salt is promoted, and on the other hand, salt producers are forced to survive. There are still more than a thousand households in Yancheng County who are homeless.</p>
<h3>The Progress of the Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Experiment Station - Work Plan Has Been Drafted -</h3>
<p>Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, in order to develop the province's aquatic resources and save the decline of the fishing industry, has planned to establish an aquatic products experiment station to conduct basic research and experiments in fisheries, as a foundation for the national aquatic products construction in the province. At the same time, he plans to organize a new type of fishing industry to guide the people. Chen Tongbai, former technical officer of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction and director of the Department of Aquatic Products, has been appointed as the director of the station. It is reported that the station has been officially established in Dinghai, and Chen Zhuanshou, Lin Shuyan, and Wu Zhongyuan have been appointed as technicians, Chen Qiongzhang, Lin Maochun, and Zhang Naigao as technicians, Lü Xianying as the general affairs director, and Wang Xi, Li Fangqi, and others as clerks and accountants.</p>
<p>The work plan proposes to conduct a detailed survey and statistics of the province's fishing conditions, fishery administration, fishing methods, and economic aspects within one or two years. At the same time, it will study important fisheries in Zhejiang Province, such as cuttlefish, yellow croaker, and ribbonfish, in order to improve them. The problem of fish fry, which is related to the national aquaculture industry, is also planned to be included in the work. In terms of manufacturing, it will focus on the cold storage and drying experiments of cuttlefish and yellow croaker. In addition, Zhejiang raises clams, with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of yuan. The station has already started research and experiments to increase production. The seaweed business is currently extremely declining, and the station also plans to have a revival plan.</p>
<h3>Nanhui's Gentry Enthusiastically Support Education</h3>
<p>Yang Shunquan, a native gentry living in Shanghai, believes that education is the foundation of a country, and rural education is the foundation of education. He has witnessed a sharp increase in the number of school-age children in the Sanjieqiao area of Beicai Town in the county. The county schools are far away. In order to fulfill his advocacy of national salvation through education, he spent money last summer to build two large school buildings and established a complete primary school. It has only been open for half a year, and the number of students has reached more than 300, with remarkable results. This semester, the school's affairs have been further improved, and the number of students has increased sharply. The original classrooms are not enough to allocate, so he has invested more money to build two more classrooms and opened a farm to implement life education. He has also submitted an application to the Education Bureau for registration. Such efforts to promote education are enough to improve the morality of the world.</p>
<h3>Continued News of Fire Brigade Members Resigning in Songjiang</h3>
<p>The resignation of the fire brigade members in this county was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The county chamber of commerce convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members and the chairmen of the industry guilds on the 26th, chaired by Cai Zhongyu, to discuss the resignation of the fire brigade members. It was publicly decided that the dredging of the city river and fire prevention are important, and the fire brigade members should all be reinstated. Cai Zhongyu and seven others were appointed to visit the county magistrate to petition. County Magistrate Jin received them and scheduled another meeting for tomorrow, which County Magistrate Jin will personally attend to guide.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Anti-Smoking Association Sets a Deadline to Investigate and Summon Smokers</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Anti-Smoking Association has set the end of March as the deadline for the first and second batches of summoned smokers to quit smoking. There are still ninety smokers in urban and rural areas who have refused to be summoned. In addition to the investigation and summons by the public security bureaus and offices, it has been decided that starting from April 1st, photos of the smokers who resist summons will be enlarged and hung in the streets. At the same time, an order will be issued to arrest and detain them for compulsory rehabilitation.</p>
<h3>The Li Guojie Case is About to Be Retried</h3>
<p>The case of Li Guojie of the China Merchants Bureau has been tried by the Jiangsu High Court and Li has been brought to the Shanghai Court for interrogation, but it has not been concluded. Hu Shancheng, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the High Court handling this case, has now scheduled to retry the case on the 30th of this month and will go to Shanghai on the morning of the 27th with Judge Shen Bingci and Clerk Zhang Yuren to prepare to bring Li to court on schedule.</p>
<h3>Spring Inspection of Water and Land Police</h3>
<p>The spring inspection of the water and land police in Jiangsu Province, the second district of Wu, Xi, Chang, Kun, Yu, Jiang, Cheng, Tai, Yi, and Dan ten counties, is scheduled to be held in Suzhou on April 3rd. The water police ships in the second district have been transferred from various counties and are moored at Panmen Baodai Bridge, divided into three infantry companies and one machine gun company. The general commander, Zhang Hanwei, head of the Wuxian District, has established a preparatory office to divide the police from various counties who are participating in the inspection in Suzhou into six shares. Yu Jingtang, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, is scheduled to come to Suzhou on April 2nd and inspect the local agencies after the inspection on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Strange News of an Elderly Couple in Their Seventies Divorcing</h3>
<p>Qin Afu, a resident of Maojing Bridge outside the North Gate, is over sixty years old, and his wife, Fang, is about the same age. They make a living by running the Qin Genji tofu shop and have some savings on hand. Recently, Afu felt that he was approaching seventy years old and still had no children, so he planned to adopt his nephew. Fang strongly opposed this, which led to a big dispute between the elderly couple. They went to extremes. Later, after mediation by Ding and others, Afu paid Fang 250 yuan for living expenses and divorced, and the storm finally subsided.</p>
<h3>Most of Jiangyin's Telephones Are Damaged</h3>
<p>There are more than 300 telephone subscribers in Jiangyin County, and the news is quite well-informed. After the recent snowstorm, many telephone poles and lines were damaged, and the long-distance telephones were also damaged and could not be used. Recently, although the county telephone bureau has ordered workers to repair them, because there is more damage, only a dozen households have been repaired, and the rest will take half a month to repair. The total loss is more than ten thousand yuan. The long-distance telephone line from this county to Jiangyin has also been damaged and is currently being repaired.</p>
<h3>Cremating Funeral Items Causes a Fire</h3>
<p>Yu Xiangzhou, a resident of Dongguanshe Mountain in front of Mei Garden, has opened an iron shop in Shen Town and has some savings. Recently, Yu died of illness, and his son, Jiasheng, hired monks to chant scriptures to fulfill his filial piety and burned a large number of ghost money and funeral items outside the door. Unexpectedly, the embers flew into the firewood in front of the mountain, causing carelessness. For a time, the wind helped the fire's power, and it was extremely fierce, spreading to the three neighboring families of Yu Jurong, Yu Zhirong, and Yu Xianglin, burning down a total of twelve houses, causing significant losses. Also, in Chenxiang Shanghoubei in the fourth district, yesterday morning, a child playing with fire burned down the houses of Yang Zhirong and Gu Er.</p>
<h3>Pessimism About Mulberry Buds Suffering From Frost and Snow</h3>
<p>This county is a silkworm and mulberry area. In addition to cultivating rice fields, farmers generally cultivate mulberry fields. During the three seasons of silkworm farming in spring, summer, and autumn, they make considerable profits. In recent years, silkworm and mulberry farming has failed, and farmers have declared bankruptcy. They have all turned mulberry fields into rice fields. Although the provincial government is making every effort to promote it and rehabilitate them, it is not as prosperous as in the past. Since the sudden snowfall on the 21st of this month, the weather has been severe, followed by heavy frost, so that the newly sprouted mulberry buds have been hit and have become withered. According to old farmers, this year's mulberry buds will be difficult to develop, and the price of leaves will definitely be expensive in the future. There is also the wheat crop, which has been crushed by the snow, and the future harvest is expected to be unfavorable.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Fine Salt Sales</h3>
<p>The Salt Affairs Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance issued instructions to the audit offices in Changlu, Shandong, Huaibei, Liangzhe, and Songjiang, as well as the Yangzi Patrol Bureau and the five tax police bureaus in Su, saying, "Since the promulgation of the fine salt sales method, all fine salt within the jurisdiction of the audit offices in Yangzi and the five districts of Su, within the prescribed sales quota in each port, can be sold smoothly without obstruction. However, if lightly taxed fine salt is transported to areas with higher tax rates, the difference in tax rates should be paid in full and officially released and collected from the place of departure; otherwise, it will be regarded as illicit salt in accordance with Article 5 of the method. Furthermore, since the promulgation of the fine salt sales method, this office has repeatedly warned against tax police interfering with fine salt. Now, we reiterate the previous order that all fine salt sold within this area, within the prescribed sales quota, regardless of the location, if it is not lightly taxed fine salt, the tax police shall not interfere. In addition to separate orders, you should comply with and handle accordingly." It is reported that the tax police authorities stationed in Xi have also received this instruction.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Lishui-Wujin Road to Open to Traffic on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Lishui-Wujin Road in Jiangsu Province is an important transportation route for the five counties of Lishui, Jurong, Jintan, and Wujin. The Department of Construction, eager to prepare for the opening of traffic, has sent a special commissioner to supervise the road construction. As of recently, the roadbeds have been rolled and compacted, and it has been decided that the entire road will be opened to traffic on April 1st. As for the vehicles, the Provincial Highway Administration is allocating them, and they will be increased or decreased depending on the business.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Two Agencies Investigate and Release Emergency Relief in Yizheng</h3>
<p>Yizheng suffered a severe drought last year, with no harvest. The number of disaster victims in the first, fourth, and fifth districts reached more than 20,000 households, who ate vegetables, bark, and roots every day. They have repeatedly appealed to charitable organizations in Beijing and Shanghai, and Zhu Zhongjian was sent by the Drought Relief Association of various provinces to Yizheng to investigate the disaster. Pan Dingzhang, a staff member from the Relief Association, and Peng Wanzan, a team leader from the Red Cross Society, came to Yizheng on the 19th to investigate and release emergency relief. It is reported that the relief funds are 8,000 yuan, and the local fundraising is 2,000 yuan, totaling only 10,000 yuan. With 10,000 yuan for relief for more than 20,000 disaster victims, it is a drop in the bucket, and the benefits are limited. It is now reported that various agencies and organizations have again requested the Shanghai Provincial Drought Relief Association and the Wuxi Red Cross Society to increase the allocation of relief funds in the hope of providing universal relief.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Anti-Smoking Standing Committee Member Comes to Cheng to Inspect</h3>
<p>Ye Xiufeng, a standing committee member of the Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee, in view of the fact that the first half-year quit-smoking licenses for anti-smoking in various counties of Jiangsu Province must be changed by the end of this month, and that the anti-smoking crime control regulations have been set to be implemented from the first day of next month, and in order to better understand the anti-smoking policy of various counties, came to Cheng from Xi yesterday (25th) afternoon at about 3:00 pm with Xu Yongji, the director of the Investigation and Suppression Division, and Zhang Gongren, a member of the Provincial Party Department. They met with County Magistrate Yan at the County Government to investigate the results of the Anti-Smoking Association's self-surrender and summons of smokers, and inspected the County Rehabilitation Center. The results were satisfactory. At about 6:00 pm, they took the Provincial Government's No. 12 car to Wujin for inspection before returning to the province.</p>
<h3>Early Trial Officer Zhou Xiang Takes Office</h3>
<p>Trial Officer Jiang Cihua was ordered by the High Court to be transferred to Fengxian, and will go to take office on the 27th. The vacancy will be filled by Zhou Xiang, a trial officer from Wujiang. Zhou came to Cheng on the 26th and officially took office.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Disaster Victims Disturb the District Office</h3>
<p>Shen Zengqi, an assistant in the first district office of Qidong, privately purchased more than ten loads of dried sweet potatoes the day before yesterday (23rd) and distributed them to poor villagers nearby. However, the disaster victims from various villages learned about this and came in droves, with about 3,000 people pouring into the district office, demanding that they be distributed by name. Seeing the large number of people, Shen said that he was not enough to distribute, so he politely refused. The disaster victims, failing to achieve their goals, cursed loudly and arbitrarily, causing trouble. The situation at the time was extremely serious. Later, District Chief Yang reported to the County Government, which dispatched a number of armed police officers to suppress them, and the disaster victims gradually dispersed.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Bandits Rob Shouchang Temple</h3>
<p>Shouchang Temple in Yongbu City, located between Nandalu and Kaiming Street, is home to the abbot Monk Shichi. There are a total of sixteen monks in the temple. Their Buddhist services are usually quite good. At about 7:00 pm yesterday (24th), four bandits suddenly came, holding white l郎lin pistols. They entered directly from the main gate and went to the bedroom of the abbot Monk Baochi. One of the bandits held Baochi's hand, raised his gun and threatened him, asking if he was the head of the household. Baochi lied that he was not, and struggled to escape to the back, shouting for robbery. Shen Liangkai, the temple's cook, heard the abbot shouting for help and went out to investigate. He met the bandits and was immediately grabbed by them. Because he stubbornly refused to yield, the bandits opened fire, hitting the cook in the lower right breast. The bullet came out from the back, and blood flowed profusely. The cook fell to the ground in agony. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the bandits fled back the way they came. Afterwards, the cook was taken to Kangning Hospital for treatment. Because of his serious injuries, his life is in danger. The military and police authorities were informed and searched everywhere. The third branch of the Public Security Bureau arrested a suspect, Chen Zigui, on Nandalu and took him to the headquarters.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: New Life Movement Inspection Group Leaves Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Four members of the New Life Movement General Association Inspection Group, including Leader Qing Yu, came to Hangzhou on the 23rd to inspect the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government's departments and offices. On the 24th, they inspected the municipal and county governments and party headquarters, and convened representatives of students from secondary and higher schools for discussions, and inspected various schools such as aviation, air defense, and Zhejiang University. On the 25th, they continued to inspect various schools. Today (26th), they inspected the provincial relief home and orphanage. At noon, Huang Shaoxiong hosted a banquet. In the afternoon, they toured the scenery of Gushan, and returned to Shanghai by train in the evening.</p>
<h3>The Survey of the Southern-Bo Railway Has Been Completed</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau is moving the engineering section to Yushan because the construction of the Nanchang-Yushan section is progressing rapidly. The entire section is scheduled to be completed and open to traffic on Double Ten Festival. To prepare for the construction of the Nanchang-Pingxiang section, a survey team was organized to survey the route of that section. The survey has been completed and the entire team returned to the province yesterday to report.</p>
<h3>Luhe: The County Government Investigates Public Servants</h3>
<p>There are quite a few public servants in this county who smoke opium. The provincial committee had secretly come to Luhe to investigate the details and reported back to the province. After learning about the situation, the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee immediately telegraphed the county to have Tang Jiayang, Da Shixin, Da Jixian, Zhang Haibo, Zhang Chengde, and Niu Kun of the county government, who smoke opium, investigated first. In addition, four county government officials, including Ye Jigao, are addicted to bad habits and should be transferred. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yang sent the above-mentioned personnel to the rehabilitation center for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Regular Squad Leader Beats a Deputy Squad Leader</h3>
<p>It seems that Squad Leader Lin Yu has been working hard for the local area since taking office. However, yesterday (22nd) morning, the squad leader invited more than 30 followers, each with a pistol and iron ruler, to gather at the Wenjin Teahouse outside the South City. Before long, Deputy Detective Squad Leader Ma Wu also arrived. For some reason, Squad Leader Lin did not say a word, but raised his hand and punched Ma Wu in the face. Then the followers surrounded and beat him. Squad Leader Ma was outnumbered and his head was broken, bleeding profusely. The two sides twisted each other to the county government. Upon hearing the news, the county government felt it was difficult to pursue the matter since both Lin and Ma were staff members of the government. Therefore, they sent Zhu Liangchen, the chief of the bailiffs, to mediate. It is said that both Squad Leaders Lin and Ma have formally filed lawsuits.</p>

<h3>Polish School Ship Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Polish Envoy Weidenthal Led Polish Nationals Aboard to Welcome; Tonight Going to Beijing to Meet Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Navy, etc., Staying in Shanghai for Five Days, Setting Sail for Hong Kong on April 1st</h3>
<p>The Polish government's large Dar Pomorze commercial training school ship, carrying 107 crew, professors, and students, departed from the port of Danzig, Poland, on September 16th last year, relying entirely on wind power to sail the ocean around the world, for practical exercises in maritime transport. It arrived in Honolulu on January 18th of this year, Yokohama, Japan, on March 1st, and departed from Nagasaki for Shanghai on the 23rd. It arrived safely in the Huangpu River yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, docking at buoy numbers 3 and 4 on the Bund. The Polish Ambassador to China, Weidenthal, personally led representatives of the Polish community to board the ship to welcome them and inquire about various matters, as follows:</p>
<p>Historically Interesting</p>
<p>The Dar Pomorze is not a warship but a school ship used by the Polish government to train merchant marine personnel. The ship is 78.5 meters long, 13.5 meters wide, has a draft of 6.85 meters, and a displacement of 1,566 tons. It is a steel-hulled ship with three masts, resembling the large sailing ships that navigate the oceans in our country in its upper part, but the hull is made entirely of steel, making it similar to a modern transport ship. The design is very artistic. Navigation relies entirely on full sails and wind power. Although it is equipped with a 560-horsepower engine, it is agreed that it will not be used unless it is extremely difficult. The ship's history is even more interesting. The ship was originally manufactured in Germany in 1909 as a commercial training ship for the German government. After the European War, the ship became the property of France. It was not until 1930 that the people of the Pomeranian Province of Poland donated funds to purchase it from France and presented it to the government, hence the name Dar Pomorze, as a permanent memorial.</p>
<p>Staying in Japan for Two Weeks</p>
<p>The ship departed from the port of Danzig, Poland, on September 16th last year, along the Baltic Sea, the islands of Santo Domingo, Cologne, and others, passing through the Panama Canal, and arriving in Honolulu on January 18th of this year, where it was warmly welcomed by the United States. It then crossed the Pacific Ocean and sailed directly to the Far East, arriving in Yokohama on March 1st. After staying for a week, it sailed to Osaka, where it docked for four days. It then stopped in Nagasaki for three days, departing from Nagasaki for Shanghai on the 23rd. The journey was smooth and calm, and it arrived at the Huangpu River at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, docking at buoys 3 and 4 on the Bund.</p>
<p>Envoy Personally Welcomed</p>
<p>When the ship sailed into the Huangpu River, its beautiful design and the fact that it was a ship rarely seen in the Far East attracted a large crowd of onlookers on the shore. The ship's hull is painted white, with a pointed bow and three masts. Full of rope ladders, the sails were all unloaded, and it would have been even more beautiful with the sails fully deployed. After docking in the center of the river, Polish Ambassador Weidenthal, accompanied by embassy counselor Wasser, embassy official Morozi, and Mr. and Mrs. Baierzi, chairman of the Polish community in Shanghai, Mr. and Mrs. Grozeski, chairman of the Polish Chamber of Commerce, and dozens of leading Polish nationals in Shanghai, held flowers and boarded the ship to welcome them. Miss Putis Jiaski, representing the Polish community in Shanghai, presented flowers to the ship's captain, Mr. Masic Zhijiyeji, to welcome them. The entire ship has a total of 107 people, including 66 naval students, a captain, training officers, German and English teachers, radio operators, a pastor, and a doctor, totaling 41 people.</p>
<p>Talks with the Captain</p>
<p>A reporter from this newspaper boarded the ship yesterday to visit and met with the captain. According to him, the ship departed from the port of Danzig, Poland, on September 16th last year, along the Baltic Sea, through the Panama Canal, and arrived in Honolulu on January 18th of this year. It then crossed the Pacific Ocean, traveling for 40 days, and arrived in Yokohama, Japan, on March 1st. When approaching the Sea of Japan, it encountered a storm, and the weather was extremely bad. It had no choice but to use the engine to arrive safely at the port. After staying in Yokohama for seven days, it toured famous scenic spots in Tokyo and Nikko. Then, it sailed to Osaka, docked for four days, and then stopped in Nagasaki for three days. It departed from Nagasaki for Shanghai on the 23rd. When sailing the ocean, it relied entirely on wind power and only used the engine near the waters of Yokohama and when entering the port. This is the first time a Polish ship has come to the Far East. He feels very happy to meet people from your country. It is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for five days and sail south to Hong Kong on April 1st, passing through Singapore, Batavia, Saint Helena, Ascension Island in South Africa, and finally, Dover, England, returning to Poland. The voyage is scheduled for one year, as anything longer would be winter, and the weather would be colder, making it inconvenient. Therefore, it cannot stay in each port for too long. As for the purpose of this round-the-world tour, it is to enable students to acquire more practical knowledge and skills. The students' studies focus on the driving skills of commercial liners. The graduation period is 48 months, including two years of classroom instruction and two years of external practice to cultivate specialized personnel for commercial liners. In China, they will visit various Chinese shipping agencies and shipping facilities.</p>

<h3>Cai Sheng Bai Discusses the Benefits of Acceptance Bills; China Communications Bank and Other Banks Also Agree to Discount Them as Much as Possible; It is Hoped That Both Local and Outlying Areas Will Promote and Implement Them Together</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in order to improve the credit sales system, increase commercial capital, and alleviate the stagnation of transactions, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association and the Shanghai Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association have established commercial acceptance bills this spring, and several companies have already implemented them. The Central Bank has also agreed to rediscount them. It is learned that the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association is also promoting them. However, some business circles have not fully understood the benefits of promoting commercial acceptance bills. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Cai Sheng Bai, General Manager of Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, who was the first to implement commercial acceptance bills. He explained the motives and processes of the promotion in great detail. The record of his talk is as follows:</p>
<p>Beneficial Without Harm</p>
<p>Mr. Cai said that commercial acceptance bills have become very common negotiable instruments in the markets of Europe and the United States. The amount on the bill ranges from tens of thousands of yuan to as low as tens of yuan. Because the credit of the acceptor is reliable and can be redeemed in full when due, banks everywhere can discount them. The discounting location is not limited to the local area. However, in our country, due to commercial habits, the credit sales system is generally valued. Therefore, very few commercial acceptance bills have been implemented in the past. However, Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory has been implementing them for three years and deeply feels that they are beneficial without harm. When the factory was first established, due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy after the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, the commercial markets in various parts of the country were unusually depressed. If the old-fashioned credit sales system were still used, not only would the danger be worrying, but the stagnation of transactions would be even worse. Therefore, he resolutely took the lead in establishing them. At that time, some silk merchants in various places did not understand the benefits of this type of negotiable instrument, so they inevitably had various concerns and difficulties. However, after making efforts to promote them and explaining them in detail, there are now no difficulties. During these three years, the value of goods traded by the factory using commercial acceptance bills has reached more than 800,000 yuan, and after each bill is cashed at the bank, not only</p>
<p>Dar Pomorze Polish Ship</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Has there never been an unexpected event, but there has never been a refusal to accept, etc. However, the general merchants value credit sales and it is difficult to change their habits. For this type of acceptance bill, there may be misunderstandings at first. In fact, those who can accept it when it is due show that this merchant</p>
<p>Has Excellent Credit and is Unquestionably Reliable. Old merchants who firmly believe in the credit sales system, when asked to sign and accept a commercial acceptance bill when purchasing goods, may even think that it damages their reputation and affects their dignity. The habit of Chinese commerce is to value verbal credit. Not only must all accounts be settled at the end of the year, but even the sending and receiving of goods at ordinary times do not have receipts. In the past, when the commercial situation was simple, there was no problem, but modern commerce has become increasingly complex, not just personal transactions, but the transactions of companies and groups, and the financial situation is unusually complicated and dense. Therefore, the need to use negotiable instruments is becoming more and more urgent. Therefore, purchasing goods for a certain amount and agreeing on a date of payment is a very common commercial credit. If the payment can be made when it is due, it not only does not damage one's dignity, but also has an excellent reputation. For example, 30 or 40 years ago, businesses and industries regarded it as a shame to pledge their own goods to others for money, which damaged their reputation, so they did it very secretly. But now, with the understanding of the principles of commercial economics, those who pledge their own goods to others for money are actually creditworthy. Therefore, pledging has become a common behavior in commercial and economic operations. Therefore, I believe that after the promotion of commercial acceptance bills, it will gradually become a habit without a doubt. These commercial acceptance bills can also be</p>
<p>Rediscounted in a Circular Manner. For example, A sells goods to B, and issues a bill that B signs and accepts. A can take the bill to Bank A for discounting. Bank A can also rediscount it to Bank B. And B receives A's goods and resells them to C. B can also issue a bill, which C signs and accepts. B can take the bill to the bank for discounting, so that the amount owed for the goods it accepts can be paid correctly when due. With such circular discounting, the stagnant goods can immediately be turned into capital with just one transaction. At the same time, the accounts receivable of all parties can also be turned into promissory notes with just one transaction. How much more lively is the application of this in economics? Therefore, customers who trade with our factory using commercial acceptance bills have known the convenience and are happy to promote it and do not want to continue using the old-fashioned credit sales system, which is clear evidence. Some say that acceptance bills seem to be suitable for promotion in the local area, but not in outlying areas. However, our factory has not only promoted acceptance bills in both local and outlying areas, but customers in outlying areas who trade using acceptance bills have never made any mistakes. Now, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association and the Shanghai Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association are vigorously promoting them, and the National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association is also advising all producers and sellers to implement them. Also, China, Transportation, National Products, Shanghai, Silk Industry, and Xinhua Banks have also indicated that they can accept and discount these acceptance bills. With increasing momentum, it is easier to promote them. Therefore, it is hoped that all industries</p>
<p>Will Promote Together. First, break the old concept of a one-year settlement of the credit sales system, and understand that after promoting acceptance bills, financial capital can be increased (that is, the stagnant accounts receivable can be used as current funds at the same time), and the accounts receivable can be turned into promissory notes, which have more precise guarantees in the bill law. Then, everyone will be happy to promote them. However, in the early stages of establishment, there will inevitably be various difficulties. But with the result of hard work and progress, it can definitely be implemented nationwide. However, this matter is a new beginning, and it is difficult for one industry and one company to implement it. In particular, it is necessary for the trade associations of various ports and industries to convene meetings to resolve and implement it together, which will be easier to do. Now, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association and the Electric Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association have resolved to implement it from April 1st. Therefore, it is hoped that the major companies and stores in this city and outlying areas will work together to promote and implement it together, so that no problems will occur in acceptance. Then, not only can Shanghai promote it to various ports without obstacles, but other ports can also continue to promote it to other ports. Then, the goods of national industry and commerce can be cashed at any time in the form of negotiable instruments, and the financial flow is not hindered, and the business progresses indefinitely. It is certain that the negotiable instrument can be manipulated.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Cotton Merchants from Three Provinces Request Increased Taxes on Foreign Cotton to Maintain the Domestic Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>A telegram from representatives of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan cotton merchants in Shanghai to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing states: Your Excellency, Ministry of Finance, our country is an agricultural country, and most farmers rely on cotton production for their livelihoods. In recent years, the government has spared no effort in developing the Northwest to improve cotton quality and increase production. Therefore, last year's output increased greatly, which is sufficient to meet the country's annual consumption. Now, foreign cotton is imported and sold at low prices, and various yarn factories are purchasing it in large quantities, resulting in a surplus of Chinese cotton and a daily decline in prices. If this is not stopped quickly, money will flow out, the countryside will go bankrupt, and the impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood will be profound and significant. Moreover, the number of cotton merchants in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, Shanghai, and Wuhan is no less than a thousand, with capital of no less than tens of millions, accounting for a large part of Shanghai's commerce. Now, they are being oppressed by foreign cotton and cannot sustain themselves. If they go bankrupt, not only will Shanghai be greatly affected, but commerce in various places will also decline, and there will be no hope for the revival of the rural economy. All countries in the East and West levy heavy taxes on imported foreign goods to resist them. Our country's tariffs are now autonomous. We should ask the Ministry to follow this example and quickly impose heavy taxes on foreign cotton to plug the leak and maintain the cotton industry. We are anxiously awaiting orders. Yang Yizhai, Guo Lizhai, Jie Qingxuan, Geng Zhijing, Zhang Yuwen, Mao Tingfang, Sun Ruitang, and Xiong Zhipu, representatives of cotton merchants from Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan in Shanghai, kowtow together. Sent on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Qian Chengxu Returns to Shanghai from Shandong; Suggests a Raw Material Loan Plan</h3>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Pao, Dr. Qian Chengxu, an official of the China Industrial Federation, was invited by Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, to go to Shandong on the 4th of this month to discuss the rescue of Shandong's rural economy and to plan the dredging of local products and the revitalization of commerce. After about two decades, he left Shandong on the 23rd and returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, reporters from the Ta Kung Pao visited the federation and Mr. Qian told them about his visit to Shandong and expressed his opinions on the raw material loan and the procedures for implementing it. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Material Loan According to Mr. Qian, he was invited by Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government to go to Shandong to discuss the rural economy and to ask for planning. In the current situation where Shandong's industrial capital is affected by the sluggish market, how should local products be dredged for sale in order to remedy the situation? After meeting with Han, I suggested unifying the industry, appropriately drawing a part of the property from farmers and businessmen, organizing a joint warehouse, issuing securities, selling them at low prices in the market, and absorbing cash. When the cash flowed back, the securities would be redeemed with cash to activate local product trade. After a long period of discussion, it was believed that Shandong's industry has not yet reached the stage of unification, and the proposed plan seems difficult to implement in practice. I was asked to come up with a second plan. Then I proposed estimating Shandong's raw materials and asking the financial community in the outlying markets to add accounting capital to facilitate turnover. While the issue was being discussed, the Shanghai China Industrial Federation published the Industrial and Commercial Finance Research Report written by financial experts Zhang Naiqi, Yang Yinpu, and Zhang Xiaomei. The principles for creating a modern capital market set forth in the report are relatively close. Therefore, in the end, I also suggested to Chairman Han that Shandong should issue a raw material credit loan of 25 million yuan, entrusting financial institutions with the existing cotton, tobacco, raw coal, peanuts, silk, and various important raw materials to make credit loans in the market to activate commerce. After six months, the original handling agency is responsible for repaying the loan. Chairman Han expressed great approval for this and contacted local merchants privately many times. The result was very satisfactory. I have telegraphed Mr. Han again, asking him to formally acknowledge and express his opinions on the suggestion in writing to complete the formalities. Once the reply arrives, I will collect all the documents and send them to the Shanghai Banking Association to ask for a special discussion on the matter. In short, Shanghai is short of cash, and industry and commerce are feeling the pinch. If Shandong can issue 25 million yuan of goods as credit, then Shanghai will have 25 million yuan more capital for turnover, which will be of great benefit to both production and sales.</p>
<p>Implementation Procedures As for the implementation procedures of the plan, they are tentatively set as follows: (1) From the private side, the intentions are orally explained to Chairman Han. After he agrees, contact the Jinan financial community to solicit their consent. (2) If the Jinan financial community thinks it is feasible, start consulting private opinions from the industrial and financial circles in Shanghai. (3) After the private contacts between Shanghai's financial and industrial circles are roughly on track, the private opinion is sent to Chairman Han in writing, asking him to express his approval. (4) After Chairman Han receives the private letter, he replies to the sender with his approval. (5) After the private person receives the written reply from Chairman Han, he/she visits the financial and industrial circles to make a general decision. (6) To make the opinions of all parties consistent, the industrial and commercial circles or the Industrial Federation officially issue an opinion, declaring their position, and at the same time, the points of the proposal are officially sent to Chairman Han of Shandong for consideration. (7) After receiving this official document, Chairman Han submits it to the Provincial Affairs Meeting for discussion of the principles, or convenes a meeting of local financial industry representatives to decide on a preliminary plan at any time without going through the Provincial Affairs Meeting. The plan is then officially sent to the person in charge of Shanghai's industrial circles in writing. (8) After receiving the plan set by Chairman Han, the person in charge in Shanghai officially convenes the relevant industrial leaders to jointly study and decide on detailed measures. At the same time, a joint meeting is held with financial leaders to negotiate on various conditions such as guaranteeing the loan. (9) After the conditions are decided, both parties begin to negotiate the organization. (10) When the organization of the institution is completed, the private task is over.</p>
<h3>Treasury Ministry's Telegram Reply to the Chamber of Commerce: Request to Abolish the Saltpeter and Sulfur Contractor System, and Order the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau to Comply with Established Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, along with the Porcelain Industry Trade Association, the National Goods Products Trade Association, and the Industrial Joint Stock Company, jointly sent a letter and telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, concerning the collection of fees from saltpeter and sulfur contractors. Yesterday, a telegram reply was received from the Ministry of Finance, the original text of which is as follows: "Regarding the telegrams previously received by this Ministry from Shanghai Tianli Company, Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Company, Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory, and the Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Trade Association, requesting the revocation of the Jiangsu Province Saltpeter and Sulfuric Acid Exclusive Sales Office, this Ministry has already instructed the Salt Affairs Department to order the Jiangsu Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau to state that sulfur and nitric acid are types of saltpeter and sulfur products, for which the Jiangsu Saltpeter and Sulfur Transportation and Sales Office has been collecting residual profits. Upon the expiration of the current contractor term, the area covered by the Saltpeter and Sulfur Transportation and Sales Office will be demarcated, and a separate office will be established to solicit merchants to handle the business, originally for the sake of convenient management and the elimination of monopolies. The previous regulation of one yuan per box for residual profits has not been increased. We immediately instructed the merchants to take note and ordered that the name of the Jiangsu Province Saltpeter and Sulfuric Acid Exclusive Sales Office be changed to the Jiangsu Province Saltpeter and Sulfuric Acid Transportation and Sales Office to avoid misunderstandings. Furthermore, the selling price of Chilean saltpeter is clearly stipulated in the contract undertaken by the Xinli Company, stating that in addition to the cost of remaining warehouse rent, insurance, and consumption, it shall not exceed 15% of the purchase price. The telegrams state that the price at which Xinli Company sells Chilean saltpeter is twice the price on the foreign market per ton, and that sulfur and nitric acid should not be used as an excuse to force manufacturers to pay double the price. After reviewing the original case, it is found to be inconsistent. In addition to ordering the Jiangsu Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau to investigate whether excessive residual profits are being collected and prices are being raised, and strictly instructing all transportation and sales offices to comply with established regulations, please take note. (Official seal of the Ministry of Finance)"</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Burial Team Reports on Recent Work in Jiangxi: Piles of Skulls, Tombs Built of White Bones, Such Heartbreaking and Tragic Sights</h3>
<p>Jiangxi Province is suffering from both banditry and drought, and the situation is dire. The World Red Swastika Society elected a president to lead three relief teams, carrying clothing, rice, and medicine, to various disaster areas to provide assistance. This has already been reported in various newspapers. It is also reported that the society found corpses and skeletons scattered everywhere in the disaster areas, and rudimentary graves that urgently needed to be taken care of. Previously, a burial team was organized and sent to the Guangchang and Ningdu areas to specialize in burial work. The team members were all selected for their perseverance, hard work, and experience in burial. Now, we have obtained a recent work report from the team, which is published below:</p>
<p>Our team departed from Nanchang on January 28th, and assigned team members to Ningdu and Guangchang counties to specialize in burial work. In Guangchang, many exposed corpses were buried in the Toupo Town area under the county's jurisdiction, and countless scattered remains and bones were collected along the way. In addition, graves buried in the riverbank area were scattered by flash floods. As spring approaches, there is a risk of epidemics. Team members have been dispatched to handle this matter. On January 30th, we arrived in Ningdu and stayed at the Liao Clan Ancestral Hall in Xuechi Lane, sharing the premises with the Second Relief Team. On February 3rd, we began work. For more than twenty days since then, we have been traveling to the mountains near the city every day to carry out burials. Except for days when we were unable to work due to rain, we have buried a total of 531 exposed corpses in places such as the mountains to the east, the Dongxue Ridge and Dapo to the south, the Weibei Ridge, Macao Ridge, Beauty Hair Dispersing Ridge (i.e., the execution ground), Fengyu Pavilion, Yinduo Mountain, Battery Mountain, Elephant Skin Beach, and Songpi Cheng to the west, and the Beitang Ridge to the north. There are also countless rudimentary graves that have been reinforced with soil. In addition, more than 400 skulls and thousands of dry bones have been collected and piled up at Beauty Hair Dispersing Ridge (it is said that thousands of people were killed here, making it the most tragic place in Ningdu), forming a bone mountain. All organizations passing by cannot help but sigh and pay their respects. Because General Chen Cheng of the 18th Army wants to build a White Bone Pagoda on the spot to leave a permanent memorial, we have not yet started construction. There are still many other mountains where we are continuing to work. Furthermore, more than ten li northeast of the city is Cuifeng Peak, a famous scenic spot in Ningdu. The solitary peak stands independently and soars into the clouds, with cliffs thousands of feet on all sides. However, there is a crack, only a foot wide, that leads directly to the top of the peak. It is only wide enough for one person to climb. There are no stone steps, and one must rely entirely on the strength of one's hands and feet, supporting oneself on the left and right. If one were to lose one's footing halfway, one would fall thousands of feet and one's bones would be crushed. The danger is enough to make one shiver. Curious people often try to climb to the top, but give up halfway due to exhaustion. It is said that there were more than 300 households on the top of the mountain, who were surrounded by bandits for more than two years. Due to lack of food, they either starved to death or were slaughtered, leaving many corpses. Our team, inspired by a spirit of charity, led all the team members to bravely go straight up, fortunately without stopping. The area at the top of the peak is two or three li, surrounded by trees, with hundreds of acres of fertile land and hundreds of houses, most of which have been burned down, with broken tiles and crumbling walls, a desolate sight. Bones are scattered everywhere. Our team collected more than twenty piles of large and small bones and buried them on the spot. Furthermore, seventy li northeast of the city, in the Changsheng Town Huangcun area of the Third District, it is said that more than a thousand people were killed and buried along the riverbank. Many of them were washed away by mountain floods, but several hundred remained unwashed. On February 21st, team members were sent to collect and bury them, building two large white bone tombs, and it is planned to mark them with stone tablets to make them permanent. Further details will be reported later.</p>
<h3>The 1927 Public Bonds Will Be Temporarily Suspended from Auction</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, a powerful figure in the financial market stated yesterday that the 1927 bonds, which have no principal or interest, have already been declared by the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance as impossible to manage due to the tight state treasury. If they are allowed to be auctioned again on the exchange, it would only encourage speculation and gambling. At the beginning of this new era, it seems that the auction should be temporarily suspended to stabilize the market and eliminate speculation. It can be auctioned again after a reasonable solution is found.</p>

<h3>International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestic Products: White Wax, Soybeans, Hair Nets, Bedspreads, Carpets, and Embroidered Goods</h3>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau, the bureau is a government agency that aims to promote direct foreign trade and is responsible for providing guidance and introductions, without any profit motive. Manufacturers should not misunderstand this. The domestic products recently requested by foreign merchants are listed below: Insect wax, also known as white wax, is a secretion of insects that live on trees and is a special product of Sichuan Province. The areas where the insects and the trees are produced are different. The insects are produced in Jianwei, Ya'an, and Huili, on the border of Sichuan and Yunnan, spanning hundreds of miles. Tens of thousands of people make a living by raising insect wax. The trees grow in Jiading, Sichuan, and the insect species must be transferred to Jiading every year to produce wax. China's candle-making industry must use white wax on the surface of candles to prevent them from melting easily. In addition, it is used in pharmacies to make wax shells to protect valuable medicines. In Europe and America, it is often used to manufacture cosmetics, decorations, and toys. A certain company in Mexico has sent a letter requesting 1,000 kilograms of white wax. Exporters can send a letter to the bureau for guidance and introduction. Furthermore, the Belgian Société Anonyme d'Importation et d'Exportation Quatre Soeurs needs shimmering large clam shells. The Cairo Brothers Company of Liverpool, England, needs soybeans. A certain company in Finland needs bamboo poles, coconut coir, and Manila hemp rope. A New York Italian Bedding Import and Export Company is seeking hair nets, bedspreads, carpets, bedding, and embroidered goods. Domestic manufacturers engaged in the above-mentioned goods can send a letter to the bureau for introduction. The address is the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building, New Rubbish Bridge.</p>
<h3>Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Society Organizes Mutual Aid Loans for Farmers and Improves Cotton Planting and Promotes Women's Production; General Meeting of All Members to Be Held on the Sixth of Next Month</h3>
<p>Since the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Society established an experimental zone in Xingang last year, it has spared no effort in improving rural education and other aspects. Now, in order to develop the rural economy, the society plans to organize mutual aid loans for farmers, improve rice planting, and promote women's production. A general meeting of all members will be held on a scheduled date. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing Mutual Aid Loans</p>
<p>In order to develop the rural economy, the society plans to organize small mutual aid loans for farmers. The society has already negotiated with the Shanghai Bank. The society will investigate farmers who actually need loans. If farmers need to purchase seeds, plowing cattle, and fertilizer, they can borrow mutual aid loans from the society, which will be underwritten by the Shanghai Bank. All interest rates will be extremely low, and it will be officially launched soon.</p>
<p>Improving Cotton Seeds</p>
<p>The society believes that the cotton seeds planted near Gaoqiao are not of good quality, which greatly affects farmers' income. In view of this, the society is improving cotton seeds and has purchased Jiangyin Baizi seeds, encouraging farmers to switch to planting them. If the harvest from planting this improved seed is less than that of ordinary cotton seeds, the society will be responsible for compensation. Therefore, the local people are willing to switch to planting Jiangyin cotton seeds.</p>
<p>Promoting Women's Production</p>
<p>The society also believes that it is necessary to reform the situation where women do not engage in production. It has formulated a plan to promote women's production, which will be gradually implemented. The women's supplementary school attached to the society will be the center for promoting this matter. The students in the class will encourage women to join. It has been decided to first organize embroidery and craftwork, which is currently being trained. It has been specially contracted with major embroidery factories. If this matter is implemented, women can earn six or seven yuan per month.</p>
<p>Scheduled General Meeting</p>
<p>The society has also scheduled a general meeting of all members for the sixth of next month. In addition to reporting on the society's affairs over the past year, the society's affairs will be discussed after the meeting. Mr. Wang Kuizheng, the general manager of the society, is currently drafting a plan to promote the society's affairs for discussion at the general meeting.</p>
<h3>Five Charitable Children's Organizations to Hold Children's Health Competition</h3>
<p>The five organizations in this city, namely the Chinese Charitable Children's Association, the Charitable Children's Education Center, the Charitable Children's Nursery, the Charitable Children's Sanatorium, and the Charitable Children's Treatment Center, are holding a Zhabei Children's Health Competition at the Charitable Children's Clinic on Xibaoxing Road on April 1st and 2nd, in order to promote children's health. At the same time, a recreational gathering will be held at the Common People's Education Center to celebrate Children's Day in advance.</p>
<h3>The Supreme Court Schedules a Continued Hearing for the Li Guojie Case on the Afternoon of the 30th of This Month at 2:00 PM</h3>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was charged with embezzling a large sum of money last year and sentenced to imprisonment. Li refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Supreme Court. After repeated hearings, it has been two years and a verdict has not yet been reached. The Supreme Court recently notified the Shanghai District Court that it will continue the hearing at the court on the afternoon of the 30th of this month at 2:00 PM. Li was previously sent to the Shanghai Hospital at the Santai Wharf in Nanshi for treatment due to illness. The Municipal Public Security Bureau was responsible for sending personnel to supervise him in shifts. Currently, Li is mentally exhausted and has not yet recovered. It is understood that Li originally lived in Ward 4, the first-class ward on the upper floor of the hospital. Room 3 next door was guarded by one sergeant and two police officers from the fourth squadron of the Public Security Bureau. Room 5 had service personnel and detectives on duty in shifts day and night. According to hospital sources, Deputy Director Sun Jiaqi plans to relocate Li to Ward 31, the infectious disease ward, because the first-class room, room 3 where Li is staying, will be converted into a drug rehabilitation center. After receiving the report, the court sent Chief Clerk Yang Cenggu to the Shanghai Hospital yesterday to conduct a site inspection as a precaution.</p>
<h3>The Principal Offender in the Tang Jiapeng Assassination Case Awaits Judgment After Interrogation; Wang Xinggao Still Vehemently Claims Innocence; Official Judgment Scheduled for April 1st</h3>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, also known as A Yu, the former manager of the Great World amusement park, was shot and killed in front of the Great World at 1:30 AM on June 18th, 1933. At the same time, a stray bullet killed a passerby, Wu Guangcai. The French Concession police arrested the assassins Zhang Xiaosizi, also known as Zhang Tinggui, and Zhao Guangfu. They were transferred to the Special No. 2 Court and sentenced to 20 years and life imprisonment, respectively. The Supreme Court's third and final trial concluded, and they were sent to prison. In December of last year, the French Concession police, based on a confession from Zhao Guangfu, arrested Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing, who was the principal instigator in the case, and sent him to the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Xiong Huiping interrogated him repeatedly and brought Zhao and Zhang to court to question Wang. Later, Judge Xiong was transferred to the High Court's Third Branch, and Judge Sun Pengxian took over the case, announcing a new trial and rescheduling it pending further study of the case. This was reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, Judge Sun continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 2. Attorney Gu Shouxi appeared in court on behalf of the Police Department. The defendant's defense attorneys, Shen Xingxia and Zhang Qikai, arrived in court on time. Zhao and Zhang were again brought to the stand for questioning. The defendant, Wang Xinggao, still vehemently claimed innocence, denying any involvement in the instigation and stating that he had been falsely accused. The official questioned Zhao and Zhang, who testified as before. The court then summoned West Constable Lang Bole, Detective Qian Yumin, and Informant Guo Shaorong, who handled the case for the police. The court found that the investigation and evidence were complete and ordered the start of the closing arguments. After arguments between the police attorney and the defendant's attorneys, the court announced the end of the closing arguments and scheduled a judgment for April 1st. The defendant was returned to the detention center, and Zhao and Zhang were sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>Hengyuan Shenji Fishmonger Shop's Closure Dispute: Shareholders' Opinions Differ; Lawyer Accused of Sealing the Business</h3>
<p>Hengyuan Shenji Pickled Fish Shop, located at No. 25, 16th Embankment, Nanshi, was established as a joint venture. Shareholder Wang Tingsheng was elected as manager. On the night of March 7th of this year, Wang Tingsheng entrusted lawyer Li Ming to send people with dozens of the lawyer's seals to seal the business. All goods and equipment were sealed. The shareholders considered this action by lawyer Li and Wang Tingsheng to be an obstruction of their rights. Therefore, they hired lawyer Lu Congzu to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the District Court, stating that Hengyuan Shenji Pickled Fish Shop is</p>
<p>a joint venture,</p>
<p>with each share costing 1,500 yuan, for a total of ten shares, with a total capital of 15,000 yuan. The first defendant, Wang Tingsheng, owns three shares, worth 4,500 yuan. The plaintiff, Hu Shaotang, owns two shares, worth 3,000 yuan. There are five other people: Zhu Jicai, Lu Wenping, Xu Yisheng, Lu Wenqin, and Mrs. Liu Hu (wife of Liu Huafeng), each owning one share. Now, the first defendant, in collusion with the second defendant, lawyer Li Ming, has sealed the business without authorization, suspending operations, which obstructs the exercise of rights. Therefore, they are filing a lawsuit according to law. The defendant, Wang Tingsheng, submitted a response, stating that the Hengyuan Shenji Pickled Fish Shop was founded by his late father and has been in operation for more than 40 years. After his father's death, Tingsheng took over as manager, also for nearly ten years. Later, some old shareholders withdrew and</p>
<p>new shares were recruited,</p>
<p>for a total of ten shares, with a capital of 15,000 yuan. Tingsheng owns three shares and is still elected as manager. Since the January 28th Incident, business has declined. For several years, he has been struggling to manage without loss. However, recently, affected by the sluggish market, by February 3rd of this year (the end of the lunar year), the losses were very large and he could not make ends meet. On February 7th, the fourth day of the first lunar month, known as the day to welcome the God of Wealth, the plaintiff, Xu Yisheng (associate), notified the rice cook and warehouse staff not to buy the festive items used to welcome the God of Wealth, saying that the shareholders had no intention of doing business. As a result, the God of Wealth was not welcomed according to custom, and the staff were alarmed. Tingsheng believed that</p>
<p>the store was founded by his father</p>
<p>and he could not bear to see the hard work of decades collapse in one day. That night, he invited the shareholders to a meeting to discuss ways to maintain the business. However, the plaintiffs, holding seven shares, unanimously stated that they had no intention of doing business. Tingsheng, for the sake of the shareholders' interests and the livelihoods of the staff, repeatedly pleaded, but the plaintiffs were resolute and nothing came of it. Tingsheng, in order to protect the interests of creditors and reduce the losses of shareholders, had no choice but to legally entrust lawyer Li Ming to liquidate the business, and his conscience</p>
<p>is clear.</p>
<p>As for the second defendant, lawyer Li Ming, responded according to the law and filed a counterclaim, alleging that the plaintiffs, Zhu Yicai and others, falsely accused him of colluding to obstruct the exercise of rights. In his response, he stated that Wang Tingsheng, as a shareholder and manager, is the legal representative of the shop and his appointment for liquidation is a legitimate act that he should perform in his capacity. How can it be considered illegal? The counterclaimant advertised the liquidation and implemented the sealing. This sealing is a necessary stage in the custody process and cannot be compared with the seizure enforced by a court or other official agency. Seizure is accompanied by legal coercion, while sealing is the same as the party's own</p>
<p>closing of the door</p>
<p>to stop trading, or the liquidator sending someone to guard it and stop entry and exit. It does not involve any coercion. The plaintiffs falsely accuse him of seizure, which is a deliberate attempt to frame him. When a liquidator seals and inventories assets, his authority originates from the appointment of the parties and is an act of custody. It is very different from the seizure of other people's property by a court or official agency, which involves detention. Parties are free to operate normally, but when they close their doors to stop business or seal their own property in their possession, there is no need to cooperate with police officers. The liquidator's</p>
<p>execution of the sealing</p>
<p>or guarding, and even the removal procedures, is no different in nature from what the parties themselves do, and there is no reason to cooperate with the police. The plaintiffs are distorting the law and deliberately fabricating facts of collusion, violence, and coercion in a civil dispute in order to subject the respondent to criminal penalties. The plaintiffs have clearly committed a crime under Article 180, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. After receiving the complaint, Judge Chen Kangsun summoned the plaintiffs and the defendant (the counterclaimant) Wang Tingsheng and Li Ming to court for questioning yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff Xu Yisheng, accompanied by a lawyer, and the defendants Wang Tingsheng and Li Ming, also hired three lawyers, Shen Junru, Ge Zhitan, and Li Shirui, to appear in court</p>
<p>to defend them.</p>
<p>The plaintiff Xu Yisheng, 28 years old, from Ningbo, testified that lawyer Li Ming sealed the business and demanded compensation for losses. Wang Tingsheng refused to hand over all the accounting books. Although the capital of 15,000 yuan has been reduced by more than 12,000 yuan, there are still more than 20,000 yuan in savings, which can still be maintained. Wang Tingsheng did not consult with the shareholders and closed the business rashly. The judge asked and obtained the testimony, saying, "Is it not that your shareholders did not intend to operate, and therefore closed down?" Xu replied, "That's not right. Wang Tingsheng did not consult with us. We posted a notice on the 9th, and he did not come to negotiate." Next, Li Ming testified that he was entrusted by Wang Tingsheng and acted entirely according to the wishes of the parties. Finally, Wang Tingsheng testified that he convened a meeting of the shareholders and they unanimously did not intend to continue the business. The judge asked, "If they agreed, why are they making things difficult for you?" He replied, "I don't know." The judge then said to the two lawyers, "Today, only one plaintiff, Xu Yisheng, is present, but Li Ming and others have already filed a counterclaim. The plaintiffs must appear in person at the next hearing." The hearing was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Operation Cracked in Southern Lane, Gaochang Temple; Chen Zuo and Xu Cao Arrested; Red Pill Case Transferred for Handling</h3>
<p>Chen Zuo, a young woman from Hunan, came to Shanghai this spring to look for her brother but failed. She lived with a man nicknamed "Little Leather Craftsman" at No. 25 Southern Lane, Gaochang Temple. The Little Leather Craftsman and Chen Zuo did not have a proper occupation and secretly established a red pill selling operation at home, specializing in red pills daily, which lasted two months. Recently, Chief Li of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau at that location learned of this and immediately led Inspector Fang Xing and six plainclothes police officers, together with Inspector Su Xin of the Gaochang Temple Police Station, all in disguise, to the address to conduct a secret search. As a result, 2,225 red pills were seized in Chen Zuo's room, and Chen Zuo and Xu Cao, an old woman from Xuzhou, were arrested on the spot. Together with the red pills, they were taken to the station and detained overnight. Yesterday, a formal document was sent to the headquarters for handling.</p>
<h3>Can Smoke Ash Cure Tuberculosis? Unscrupulous Doctor Accused; Case Transferred to the District Court for Investigation</h3>
<p>Cai Wanjie (the deceased) was 31 years old, a native of Yancheng, and resided at No. 25, Qiu'an Lane, Changan Road, under the jurisdiction of the Hengfeng Road Police Station in Zhabei. He worked as a rickshaw puller and had some savings. Unfortunately, Cai suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis in the second half of last year. Later, through an introduction, he was examined by Feng Xiaofu, a doctor from Taizhou (who did not have a license or a health bureau certificate), who lived at No. 134 Jinling Road. Feng instructed Cai to take pills. From last year until Cai's death, Feng charged him 40 to 50 yuan for pills. Until the morning before his death, the deceased's wife asked about her husband's condition, and Feng replied that he had passed the danger period. However, at around 9:00 PM that night, Cai passed away. After the remaining pills taken by the deceased were tested, it was discovered that the pills were made by Feng using opium smoke ash mixed with other harmless ingredients. They were heated over a lamp and had the smell of opium smoke. Therefore, it was known that Feng Xiaofu was using deceptive means to swindle money. The deceased's brother, Cai Shiduan, reported Feng Xiaofu's medical malpractice to the Hengfeng Road Police Station. After receiving the report, Director Lu Pei immediately summoned Feng for questioning, reported to the Inspectorate of the Public Security Bureau, and ordered Lu Abao, the local representative of the twelfth district, to file a report with the Shanghai District Court for an autopsy. At around 2:00 PM, Coroner Du Jiasheng, together with Recorder Jiang Shaojie, arrived at the scene and confirmed that the deceased, Cai Wanjie, had died of illness. The corpse was returned to the family for preparation of the coffin and burial. Feng Xiaofu and the plaintiff Cai Shiduan were questioned by Director Lu. Because the case involved allegations of medical malpractice causing death, the plaintiff and defendant were immediately sent to the Zhabei Branch of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau and were transferred to the Shanghai District Court yesterday afternoon for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Organization: People's Welfare Management Committee; Over Thirty Committee Members Selected; Two Sites Confirmed for Affordable Housing Construction</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government is about to establish the People's Welfare Enterprise Management Committee, and its list of committee members has already been finalized. It is understood that the number of members will exceed thirty, most of whom are leaders from the city's industrial and commercial sectors. Westerners have also been invited to serve as committee members. The list is expected to be officially announced within days. After the committee's establishment, its first priority will be planning the construction of affordable housing. The addresses for affordable housing have already been determined: one in the city center and one in Tanzi Bay. The committee's affairs will be managed by Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya. An official announcement of the committee's establishment will be made after the list of committee members is formally released. It is also learned that the Concession authorities have expressed their deep sympathy for Mayor Wu's efforts to promote people's welfare. Therefore, the Concession authorities are willing to do their utmost to assist the Municipal Government in promoting this endeavor in the future.</p>

<h3>Suicide of Upper-Class Traveler at the Fair Hotel; No Possessions or Suicide Note; True Identity Uncertain</h3>
<p>At 11:30 p.m. on the 24th, a middle-aged man with a local accent and neatly dressed checked into the Fair Hotel at No. 291, next door to Baoyu Lane on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. He claimed to be Liu Jihua, 32 years old, from Shanghai, and engaged in the foreign goods business. A receptionist led him upstairs and booked room 30 for him. After paying the room fee, he went out again and did not return to the hotel until 1:30 a.m., when he entered the room, closed the door, and went to sleep. It is unknown what caused him to take poison and commit suicide that night. After swallowing the poison, he lay on the bed fully clothed, waiting for death to arrive. At noon the next day, Han Yingguan (32 years old), a tea boy from Songjiang, noticed that he was still sleeping soundly and had not gotten up. Following routine, he knocked on the door and asked if the room was to be extended. After calling out for a long time, there was no response from inside the room. Realizing something was wrong, he managed to pry open the door, which was bolted from the inside. Upon entering, he found Liu lying supine on the bed, fully clothed. Upon touching him, he found that he had already died and his body was cold. He immediately informed the front desk and reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. An empty box of prepared opium was found next to the pillow. There were no other possessions or a suicide note left behind, so the reason for his suicide is unknown. There is also no way to contact his family. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall for preservation. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the Special No. 2 Court, and Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with forensic doctors Wei and Jiang, and Clerk Zhao, etc., were dispatched to the hall at noon to examine the body. It was confirmed that the deceased had died by taking poison before death. The court convened a hearing. After the detective reported the case, the witness, tea boy Han Yingguan, was questioned about the circumstances of the discovery. It was ordered that the body be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photographing, encoffining, and burial, pending identification by relatives. However, whether the deceased's name is genuine is still difficult to determine. The body was wearing a gray lined spring jacket, a melon-cap, coffee-colored woolen socks, and gray Walter's呢shoes. He had delicate features, a medium build, and appeared to be an upper-class person.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Receives YMCA Fundraiser Team Leaders</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 p.m., Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a tea party at his residence on Haig Road for the forty team leaders, deputy team leaders, and donation group leaders of the YMCA's current fundraising campaign, as well as members of the fundraising committee. Attendees included Yu Qiaqing, Wang Boyuan, Qiu Zhihao, Yao Mulian, Dong Kechang, Xie Baosheng, Cao Yunxiang, Fu Zhuozhao, Wu YunChu, Cai Jingjun, Hu Xiyuan, Ying Shugui, Jin Ketian, and over sixty others, along with the entire staff of the YMCA, including Lu Ganchen and Yang Yihui. Mayor Wu, along with Li Dachao, Zhang Tingrong, and Tang Shixuan from the Municipal Government, warmly received them. After the meeting, a commemorative photo was taken in front of the residence. It was not until the clock struck six that the guests and hosts dispersed, having enjoyed themselves. During the meeting, Mayor Wu also delivered a sincere speech, excerpts of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: Today, as a local official, I am honored to invite the team leaders and deputy team leaders of the YMCA's current fundraising campaign to this tea party. Last year, the YMCA's fundraising goal was 60,000 yuan, but the result reached over 80,000 yuan, exceeding the expected amount by one-third. This is sufficient to demonstrate that people in society have a deep understanding and enthusiastic support for the YMCA, which is why such a result was achieved. Based on last year's results, with Minister Kong as the overall team leader and effective leadership, even more amazing results can be expected this year. Recently, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the entire country, encouraging the people to engage in labor and service. The meaning of life is not merely to seek personal food, clothing, and shelter; there must be a spirit of labor and service. Food, clothing, and shelter are merely tools for living to serve society. As for various social undertakings, some rely on the government to organize, some rely on individuals in society to organize, and some rely on cooperation between the government and individuals in society. Depending on the nature of the undertaking, each should exert their full effort. Only then can various social undertakings advance rapidly. However, there are also many individuals who are enthusiastic about social welfare and public service. But the majority of people's views are not only limited to planning for their own personal lives, but even working like beasts of burden for their descendants. Therefore, many social undertakings cannot be organized, or cannot be completed due to insufficient strength, or cannot be perfected due to insufficient financial resources. Therefore, the people of our country should devote a portion of their spirit, financial resources, and time to serving society, to supplement the inadequacies of government agencies. The YMCA has a history of 35 years. Its various works are well known to us. It is not only a valuable social organization, but its spirit is also sufficient to serve as a model for general social undertakings. Since we acknowledge the YMCA as a valuable social undertaking, we should use our time, financial resources, and abilities to help it, so that its cause can develop day by day. This year, the YMCA's fundraising campaign has been joined by the sons of prominent social figures and the main forces. The results will definitely be more advanced than last year. Although I serve as the chief of staff, I sincerely hope that everyone will work hard and progress diligently. I will naturally strive to follow in your footsteps and achieve success together.</p>

<p>Brief Biography</p>
<p>Shi Qingyang was from Chongqing, Sichuan Province, and a licentiate. He studied at Chongqing Middle School and later studied sericulture in Japan. He joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) in Tokyo, Japan, and followed Sun Yat-sen in the revolution. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, he returned to Sichuan under Sun's orders and served as a director of the Tongmenghui in Chongqing. During the Chongqing Restoration in 1911, he led the suicide squad and later served as the commander of the Volunteer Army. He was reorganized as the commander of the 20th Regiment of the 5th Division of the Sichuan Army. During the anti-Yuan Shikai campaign in 1913, he served as the commander of the Guerrilla Forces in northern Sichuan. After the failure of the campaign, he fled to Japan and joined the Chinese Revolutionary Party. In 1915, during the so-called National Protection War against Yuan Shikai, our party first organized the Chinese Revolutionary Army. Despite the difficulties, the banner of the Chinese Revolutionary Army was still raised. Only Qingyang in Xiyang, Xiushan, and Pengshui in Sichuan, Zhu Zhixin in Xiangshan, Guangdong, and Ju Zheng in Ju County, Shandong, rose up. In 1917, during the National Pacification War, he was appointed by Sun Yat-sen as the Pacification Commissioner of northern Sichuan and fought bitterly against the enemy on the south bank of Chongqing with the Guizhou Army. He also served as the commander-in-chief of the guerrilla army and subsequently captured Shunqing, Guang'an, and other counties. In 1918, the Guangzhou Military Government specially awarded Qingyang the rank of Lieutenant General in the Army to commend his contributions. He then served as the Commander-in-Chief of the First Route Army of the Yunnan-Sichuan National Pacification Army in aid of Shaanxi, the Commander of the 6th Division of the Sichuan Army, and the concurrently as the Jialing Dao尹. In 1921, he followed Sun Yat-sen on the Northern Expedition and was stationed in Guilin, serving as a counselor in the General Headquarters. In 1922, he was ordered to return to Sichuan to comfort the troops, and then ordered to lead his old troops to suppress bandits, serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the First Route Army of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression Army and the concurrently as the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Sichuan Border Defense. In 1923, at the First National Congress of our party, he was appointed by Sun Yat-sen and elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee. At that time, Qingyang, with his two divisions and one mixed brigade, had been fighting in Sichuan for two years and was defeated and stationed on the border. He deeply felt the necessity of uniting the Southwest and suggested to Sun Yat-sen that Tang Jiyao be appointed as the Deputy Marshal, which was approved. He then left his troops and traveled to Guangdong and Guangxi. Just as things were about to succeed, Sun Yat-sen passed away shortly after going north, so he stayed in Beiping and formed the Zhongshe. Later, the youth in the North who adhered to the party's principles and resisted the Communist bandits actually had the Zhongshe as their core. In 1925, he returned to Sichuan and was arrested by Wu Peifu in Hankou because his bandit suppression army had intercepted the ships carrying arms and ammunition that Wu was transporting to Sichuan. People from all sides, both North and South, came to his aid, and he was spared from disaster. In 1927 and 1928, he traveled to the three provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, making various arrangements for the party's forces and mediating their disputes from time to time. In 1929, he came to Nanjing and was appointed as the Special Commissioner for the Development of Yunnan and Kangding, but he did not go. He was appointed as a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. In 1932, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. In March of this year, he resigned due to illness and sought medical treatment. At 5:05 p.m. on March 25th, he passed away at the Maierong Hospital in Shanghai at the age of 57.</p>

<h3>"Stop Spitting" Campaign to be Mobilized Tomorrow; Spitting is a Major Cause of Tuberculosis Transmission; 1.6 Million People Die from Tuberculosis Every Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association's "Stop Spitting" campaign rally is scheduled to be mobilized starting tomorrow. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration of the Rally: The Declaration of the "Stop Spitting" Campaign Rally states, "The harm of tuberculosis is well known to everyone. Because we lack common sense and are ignorant of prevention, the number of people sacrificed each year is about one million six hundred thousand, and there are even more patients. Why is there so much tuberculosis in China? There are many reasons, but we believe that spitting everywhere is the biggest reason. We can often see people spitting casually on buses, trams, roads, movie theaters, and public places. It must be known that spitting casually is the biggest cause of spreading tuberculosis bacteria, because the patient's bacteria can be spread on the ground or fly in the air, leading to the transmission of tuberculosis. If we want to prevent tuberculosis from spreading, we should try our best to eliminate the bad habit of spitting everywhere. Spitting should be done in a spittoon, gutter, handkerchief, or paper, because the sputum in the spittoon and gutter will not spread, and the handkerchief can be boiled in boiling water, disinfected, and then washed clean with soap, and the paper can be burned. The above words are our sincere advice to everyone in the "Stop Spitting Everywhere Campaign", and at the same time, we sincerely ask everyone to implement them conscientiously. Finally, please pay special attention: (1) Persuade against spitting everywhere on roads, buses, and public places. (2) Spitting everywhere is spreading tuberculosis. (3) Spitting everywhere is tantamount to murder. (4) Spitting should be done in a spittoon, gutter, handkerchief, or paper."</p>

<h3>An Old Thief with Gray Hair Commits Theft; Has Been Imprisoned Repeatedly but Remains Unrepentant; Deceives Women and Robs Them of Their Jewelry; Pretends to Be Senile and Answers Questions Irrelevantly During Trial</h3>
<p>Chen Fuqing from Nanjing, now sixty years old, has gray hair and a long beard. Since his youth, he has been idle and engaged in burglary, robbery, and fraud. He has been arrested by the police multiple times, but because his sentences were short, he was soon released after being imprisoned. It was not until 1931 that he was sentenced to five years in prison for a major fraud case, but he was soon granted amnesty, so he never remained a prisoner for long. Even after being released from prison, his bad habits persisted into old age, and he has become even more daring. Relying on his elderly appearance, he pretends to be a rustic peasant and loiters in various entertainment venues all day long. When he sees someone who can be deceived, whether male or female, he uses different tricks depending on the person, and most fall into his trap. Such a person is truly an old and useless man. Now, this scourge of society has been arrested again for committing a crime. The incident involves a woman named Zhong Yuan, who is thirty-four years old. Although she is middle-aged, she has not lost her alluring nature. Her husband, Zhong Jiaxin, is working in Zhenjiang, and the woman, unable to bear being alone, often goes to various entertainment venues in the evening, ostensibly for amusement, but her real intention is not for pleasure. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, the woman went to the Tianyun Building of Wing On Company as usual. While visiting the Civilization Theater, she happened to meet Chen Fuqing. Chen, being an experienced con artist, naturally knew at first sight what to do. He immediately put on various displays in front of the woman, making sure that she saw the ring on his finger and the watch hanging from his chest, and then he took out a huge wad of banknotes and pretended to be counting them. He spared no effort in showing off his wealth. The woman was indeed lured by the glittering gold and colorful banknotes, and sweet words soon made her follow Chen's lead. They went together to the Unity Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. Chen, using the alias Gu Liufa, booked room 22. After the waiter left the room, Chen immediately offered the woman a cup of fragrant tea. She took the cup and drank with him. As soon as the woman drank the tea, she became dazed and speechless, and Chen could do whatever he wanted with her. Chen did not bother to become intimate with her, but immediately took the only objects he was after - a gold ring and a ring with three small diamonds - from the woman's fingers and left. Half an hour later, the woman woke up and realized that Chen was gone and her jewelry was also missing. She realized that she had been conned and quietly left the hotel to report to the Old Zha Police Station, falsely claiming that she had been robbed by two bandits at No. 542 Lane on Avenue Edward VII and lost two rings worth a total of sixty-one yuan. She described in detail the appearance of one of the bandits. The woman also went to the Tianyun Building and told the receptionist Huang Apin what had happened, asking him to pay attention. Chen returned to the entertainment venue the day before yesterday and was arrested by the police and taken to the police station. After an investigation by Detective Zhang Yi, he was taken to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning for trial by Judge Qian. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer for the police station, explained the incident, stating that similar cases had occurred several times recently in the Old Zha area, and Zhong Yuan was not the only victim. He charged the defendant with Article 340 of the Criminal Code, but said that further investigation was needed and requested an adjournment. Detective Zhang then reported the circumstances of the arrest, stating that a ruby was found on his person, which Zhong Yuan recognized as the stolen item. In addition, the ring and watch chain worn by the defendant were all made of copper, and he had twenty-four yuan in banknotes, which he used to make the surface of each stack of banknotes, as he inserted waste paper in the middle of each stack. Zhong Yuan (named A Gui) also gave a detailed account of what had happened. However, the defendant, Chen Fuqing, pretended to be deaf and dumb, deliberately giving irrelevant answers to the questions asked by the court, revealing the cunning of an old fox. Judge Qian then ordered him to be detained for another hearing at a later date.</p>

<h3>Continued Trial of the Jiande Bank Case; Plaintiff's Lawyer Requests Another Auditor to Review the Points Raised by the Plaintiff to Clarify the Facts</h3>
<p>Following the collapse of Jiande Bank, all directors and General Manager Chai Chuangui et al. were sued by creditors for fraud and embezzlement. The First Special District Local Court has repeatedly held hearings and summoned the defendants for questioning, as reported in this newspaper on several occasions. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu continued the trial. Six of the defendants appeared in court: Li Jingwei, Tu Kaizheng, Chai Yousheng, Yan Ziyu, Xie Keming, and Ma Suizhi. The remaining defendants, Chai Chuangui, Chen Xifu, Ou Jiancheng, and Zheng Huaigu, did not appear. The court first questioned Chai Yousheng, who testified that there were eleven directors in the bank, and no executive directors were appointed. Chai Chuangui was responsible for the bank's affairs. Wei Haijiang's investment was voluntary, and he said that the bank's collapse was caused by Wei's lawsuit. The court, noting that he was distorting the facts, then asked him about the reasons for the collapse, but his answers were even more ambiguous. Judge Liu then instructed the defendants, saying, "Wei Haijiang's lawsuit is slightly different from ordinary cases. In addition to subscribing for shares, he also used real estate as collateral to support the bank, but now there is nothing he can do, causing him to suffer a major loss. It is not only unreasonable, but also legally speaking, you are all directors and should be responsible." The plaintiff's representative lawyer, Gao Junxiang, then stated, "The defendant Yan Ziyu claims that he never attended board meetings and denies being a director. In fact, attendance is irrelevant. If Yan had resigned as a director, there should be written proof. It has been found that the board of directors resolved that the directors should advance funds, and Yan also raised 4,500 yuan. If he was not a director, why would he advance funds?" The court then questioned the representative of accountant Pan Xiren about the bank's liquidation process. The representative stated that they only audited the accounts as of December 7th and found that the paid-up share capital was 500,000 yuan, and the losses were only slightly more than 130,000 yuan. However, the accounts before December 7th were never audited, so everything in detail cannot be clearly understood. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, then stated that the case had been heard many times, but the accounts had not been clarified, leading to an indefinite conclusion. Therefore, he requested that the court appoint another accountant to audit the accounts, saying that the accountant who appeared in court today did not provide detailed reports and his words were ambiguous. As far as the plaintiff knows, the bank's share capital was only 200,000 yuan. In order to be fair and accurate, another accountant should be appointed to review the points raised by the plaintiff, which would be easier to understand and would not delay the matter any further. Lawyer Gao also raised several points of doubt regarding the account books, such as the alterations in the capital book and the discrepancy in the account names, and requested that they be investigated together. Judge Liu then ordered an adjournment for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Protects Tea Merchants</h3>

It is hoped that tea merchants from various ports will come to do business without missing the opportunity."</p>

<h3>The Commodity Inspection Bureau Notifies Tea Merchants - Thick Paper Should Be Used to Line Tea-Packed Lead Casings to Prevent Lead from Mixing into Tea Due to Friction - The US Government Has Recently Issued an Order to Ban This</h3>
<p>When tea is packed for export, thick paper must be used between the tea and the lead casing (commonly known as tin cans) to prevent lead from mixing into the tea due to friction, which would affect hygiene. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau recently discovered that many tea boxes did not have lining paper in the lead casings, and lead was often mixed in, which is a major concern for hygiene. The US government has recently issued an order to ban this. According to the chemical analysis of the US Department of Agriculture, if the lead content in each pound of tea exceeds 0.019 grams cold, it will not be allowed to be imported (one gram cold is equal to 0.0648 grams gramme, and the above limit is equal to 2.7 pounds per million). This will have a significant impact on our foreign trade. A letter has been sent to the Tea Industry Association to inform all tea merchants that thick paper must be used between the tea and the lead casing when packing tea in the future to ensure hygiene.</p>

<h3>Jin Xingjian Invents Vacuum Fountain Pen</h3>
<p>Chinese people with sufficient financial resources usually purchase expensive products from the United States and other countries for fountain pens. The general public usually buys cheap and inferior goods from a certain country, resulting in a huge outflow of profits. Jin Xingjian, a Chinese man, foresaw this and traveled overseas many years ago to specialize in researching this manufacturing technology. In 1931, he returned to China and founded the Jin Xing Fountain Pen Factory in Shanghai to manufacture various domestic Jin Xing brand fountain pens, which are sold throughout the country. The quality and low price have long been recognized by the general public. However, Mr. Jin still felt that this was not enough and continued to delve into the technology. Now he has succeeded in inventing a vacuum fountain pen. The pen barrel is completely vacuumed, the color is transparent, the writing is smooth, and it never leaks. It holds four times more ink than ordinary products, and the quality is no less than that of Parker, but the price is several times lower. The raw materials are also purely domestic. A few months ago, he submitted it to the Industrial Technology Promotion Committee of the Ministry of Industry for examination and requested a patent. The committee has now completed the examination and recognized that it is a valuable invention of the Chinese people and officially announced that it will be granted a patent for five years. After receiving the patent, Mr. Jin ordered the factory to step up production of the first batch of new products (the factory is currently located at No. 390 Kang Nao Road). It is expected that they will be available to the public in one or two months.</p>

In the autumn of 1933, she fell ill in bed and died on April 4, 1934, at the age of 76. Four generations lived under one roof. Madam Liu was good at managing the household and teaching her sons to become famous. Her grandson, Rui Hongchu, is employed at Dasheng Silk Shop. On April 8th of this year (March 6th of the lunar calendar), Mr. Rui returned to his hometown (Wuzhen) to hold a memorial service for the anniversary of his grandmother's death and immediately removed the curtain and entered the ancestral hall that evening.

<h3>Jin Cheng Bank's Business Report for 1934 (13)</h3>
<p>Within this year, the exchange rate market fluctuated extremely drastically. In the past, due to trade relations, the prices of silver dollars in various places were higher than Shanghai dollars. The Shanghai Tianjin exchange rate in 1930 was 1006.9 yuan, the Qingdao exchange rate was 1004.4 yuan, and the Hankou exchange rate was 1007.6 yuan. After 1931, the rural areas declined, the export of agricultural products decreased, and the domestic trade deficit had to be paid with silver. The Shanghai dollar price rose. Therefore, the annual average of Shanghai's domestic exchange rate in 1933 dropped to 1001.4 yuan for Tianjin, 1001.3 yuan for Hankou, and 1000 yuan for Qingdao. From January to September of this year, this trend did not change, and more silver flowed into Shanghai, causing the exchange rate to fall sharply. The average Tianjin exchange rate fell to 998 yuan in July, the Qingdao exchange rate also fell to 999 yuan, and the Hankou exchange rate was still able to maintain around 1000 yuan. However, after October, the exchange rates of coastal ports soared. For example, the Tianjin exchange rate rose to 1017 yuan on November 26th, and Qingdao and Yantai also rose to 1014 yuan on November 28th, while the Hankou exchange rate remained around 1002 yuan. The exchange rates of inland areas such as Bengbu and Changsha also changed little. Due to the convenience of transportation along the coast, there was a lot of smuggling after the silver tax was levied, resulting in a shortage of silver and an increase in demand for remittances to and from Shanghai, so the exchange rate continued to rise.</p>
<p>This year's foreign exchange was affected by the US silver policy and the exchange rate dumping of various countries, and the prices all rose sharply. After the export tax on silver was levied, the prices were slightly restricted. The beginning of the year was still mediocre, but the prices rose sharply in February, especially for the US dollar and the Japanese yen. After June, the price of silver gradually increased, and the exchange rates of various currencies also increased uniformly, reaching a peak on October 13th. One hundred national currency could be exchanged for 7.5 pounds of British gold, 13 Japanese yen, and 37 US dollars. Compared with the exchange rate in September 1931, the US dollar exchange rate increased by 43%, the British exchange rate increased by 67%, and the Japanese exchange rate increased by 210%. After the export tax on silver was levied, China's silver price lost contact with the world silver price and was lower than the world silver price, so the exchange rates of various currencies all contracted uniformly. The US dollar exchange rate fell to 32 yuan, the British exchange rate fell to one shilling and three pence, and the Japanese exchange rate fell to 110 yen. However, the trend still felt weak after November.</p>
<p>As for the financial industry itself, there has also been progress in the current situation, and there are many new directions for business operations. However, the changes in the market are also quite drastic. In the past year, 16 new silver firms were established, 3 were restored, and 49 new branches were established. In Shanghai, 12 firms closed down. Bank closures were also frequently reported in Ningbo, Nanjing, Tianjin, Suzhou, Anqing, Yangzhou, and other places. In this period of economic decline, a slight carelessness could lead to failure. The government's financial measures include cracking down on speculation in foreign exchange, implementing the Savings Bank Law, changing the margin to be calculated based on customs gold units, levying export taxes on silver, and establishing a foreign exchange stabilization committee. These are all important plans. However, the world economy and the domestic economy are closely related. In today's position of being dominated by international economic forces, how should we observe the global economic situation externally and examine our own situation internally, and deal with it properly without suffering losses? This is what we hope for. (2) Prices In China, prices in all regions fell sharply this year. Compared with the average wholesale price this year and the average price last year, Shanghai fell by 7%, North China fell by 9%, and Nanjing fell by 12%. Classified by industry, Shanghai's prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— (Wang Xiaolin)</p>
<p>Westerners use knives and forks to eat, while Chinese people use round chopsticks. Knives and forks symbolize aggression, while chopsticks can symbolize smoothness. The difference in the personalities of Chinese and foreigners can be seen in this small "eating" posture.</p>
<p>Using words like flowers and birds to describe women is said to be male chauvinism. But generally, emerging female writers have used and continue to use such words to describe women. What should this be considered? Is it female chauvinism? !</p>
<p>The world rains, the ground is wet; he loves her, she falls. The mystery in this, as long as you turn your mind, you can understand.</p>
<p>At present, the life of prostitutes has plummeted, and the comedy of marrying into a good family as a concubine has "not been heard for a long time." On the other hand, cases of female students' adultery are emerging one after another, and the tricks of new women degrading themselves into disguised concubines are unfolding before our eyes. Ha! A humorous contrast.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Tomb of an Unknown Hero</h3>
<p>— Yixin</p>
<p>From a winter that never snowed, we slipped away, and soon, the world was arranged into a lovely picture of lush green again.</p>
<p>The sun shines so warmly, and the wind blows so refreshingly; indeed, spring is too mysterious, like a beautiful maiden, constantly exuding an enticing magic.</p>
<p>We could no longer bear it, so we skipped class, hastily brushed the chalk dust off our collars and sleeves, pulled Lao Hu, and walked out of the school gate with a brisk pace.</p>
<p>Walking, walking, passing through green fields, listening to the gurgling of water, we finally stopped at a barren mound arranged like a trench; from a wooden board washed by rainwater, with only a few ink marks remaining, we discovered that this was the burial place of our loyal and brave soldiers.</p>
<p>"Four years," I thought to myself, "Alas, the hot blood shed by the brave warriors for the country has become a glass of red wine in people's minds."</p>
<p>We wandered around this forgotten, ownerless barren mound, sent the sunset home, and the smoke from the chimneys everywhere wove a wartime smokescreen, reminding us of this day four years ago. It was our loyal and brave soldiers who, taking advantage of this natural cover, charged and killed the enemy. We couldn't help but feel a little desolate.</p>
<p>Returning in the twilight, the spring-like, maiden-like temptation in my mind had been replaced by a scene of war memories.</p>
<h3>Young Master Ming</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Young Master Ming is my old neighbor and was my classmate when I was in elementary school.</p>
<p>His father was very rich, and he was an only son, so in his childhood, his life was not only something all the children in our neighborhood envied, but also something none of the classmates didn't envy. Indeed, he was always wearing beautiful clothes, eating delicious candies, and playing with expensive toys.</p>
<p>He married at the age of eighteen. And his wife was so beautiful.</p>
<p>After he got married, he stopped studying and doing business, spending his days listening to operas and playing cards. When he got tired of that, he went out to play with women.</p>
<p>When he was twenty, his father died. Less than a year later, his mother also died. So he was even more comfortable, spending money as he pleased, with no one to interfere with him.</p>
<p>In one year, he squandered all his Shanghai stocks on gambling and whoring. From the second year, he began to sell the fields and properties in his hometown. In the third year, he lived by borrowing from relatives and friends. In the fourth year, he could no longer maintain himself and sold off his furniture and clothes. His wife, in that year, divorced him.</p>
<p>From then on, Young Master Ming was left all alone. He couldn't borrow any more money. His former close friends no longer greeted him. In the summer, he would go shirtless, and in the winter, he would wear a tattered cotton-padded jacket he had begged for. Sometimes he would even sit on the steps, catching lice in the sun.</p>
<p>I didn't see him all of last year, and I thought he was no longer among the living. But unexpectedly, this time, on the Old Zha Gate Bridge, I saw him pulling a rickshaw for me.</p>
<p>Looking at his demeanor, I fear he has also picked up the habit of using narcotics.</p>
<h3>Metropolis Monster Appears</h3>
<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: A Sad Night's Conversation Reveals Life as a Dream; Random Footprints, Wind and Rain are Too Oppressive</p>
<p>Huanhua said, "Don't even mention it! That's why I think it's terrifying when women in society can't stand on their own two feet. This young lady's father came to Xi'an before the Qing Dynasty, and it's said he was an old bureaucrat. This young lady was the youngest, so of course she was loved very much, and they let her study. But he hasn't been an official for many years, and in Xi'an, they experienced the great hardship of an eight-month siege, followed by two years of severe drought, so the family became very poor. They originally planned to return to their old home in Anhui, but they hadn't heard any news in many years, so they didn't know what had become of it. Besides, they still had a dilapidated house to live in here, so they could save on rent. The cost of living here is different; living like Easterners is even more expensive than in the East, because goods come from outside Tongguan. Living like the local people, they eat some Guokui (hard flatbread) every day, drink a little rice soup, and can even save on oil and salt; a family can get by on a few dollars a month. That's why they hesitated to leave. Later, they couldn't even leave if they wanted to, because they couldn't raise the travel expenses. This girl, though, continued to study. But modern fashion harmed her. In the past two years, transportation has become more convenient, and people from the East have been coming here one after another. Women in fashionable clothes can often be seen on the streets. Which young girl doesn't like to look good, so they follow the women from the East and learn to dress like them. But that's not easy. A pair of leather shoes, shipped from Shanghai to Zhengzhou, from Zhengzhou to Tongguan, and from Tongguan to Xi'an, would probably cost seven or eight dollars a pair. Ordinary families can live for a month on seven or eight dollars; who would be willing to buy such expensive things for the young girls to wear? They fell in love with modern fashion and always wanted to learn it. If they couldn't get money from home, they would go outside to find it, and Little Western Paradise was the first place they looked for money." Jia Duocai said, "So that's how it is. But this isn't a matter of applying and taking an exam. How do they get in?" Huanhua said, "This is the bad part of making bad friends. For example, they're all poor girls, and none of them can afford silk skirts or leather shoes. But one or two of them suddenly become fashionable, with watches, silk clothes, and silk stockings." (167)</p>
<h3>Royal Incense Vaguely Recorded</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>There was only one thing that could be considered both a game and practical. That was when the silkworms were about to spin silk, picking one or two of them and putting them on a thin piece of paper pasted over the mouth of a teacup, letting them spin the silk they were going to use to make cocoons onto the paper. Then, the paper filled with silk would be cut into round or oval shapes, with velvet as a pad, and used as a powder puff or to apply fragrant oil, which was indeed the softest and smoothest. I still think of it every time I put on powder.</p>
<p>Although the Empress Dowager herself only treated silkworms as a toy, the girls she hired to take care of the silkworms were still very serious about their work due to the influence of so many traditional superstitious ideas. They seemed like a group of devout nuns, and the silkworms were their sacred objects.</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Five: Artisans of Various Trades</p>
<p>In the palace, it could be said to be a self-contained society. There were not only girls in charge of raising silkworms, but also artisans of various other trades! The skills of these artisans were naturally excellent, far superior to ordinary workers outside. The Empress Dowager also firmly believed that they were rare masters and often took pride in them. Moreover, she herself was very interested in these delicate crafts and would often go to see them. Coincidentally, I was also someone who loved to watch people do fine work—although I couldn't do any of it myself—so the Empress Dowager would always take me with her, and after going there, she would linger as if she were watching some novel opera and be reluctant to leave. (278)</p>
<h3>Two-Legged Shen Bao</h3>
<p>— Xian Weisheng</p>
<p>There are dozens of newspapers published in the city. Regardless of the content, what is particularly commendable is that no matter what the name of the newspaper is, people lump them all together and call them Shen Bao, as if Shen Bao were a generic term for all newspapers. If it weren't for its senior status, how could it have penetrated people's minds so deeply? I often hear people say, "Have you read the Shen Bao today?" "Is there any news in today's Shen Bao?" "Thank you, give me a few copies of Shen Bao to wrap things with," and so on.</p>
<p>The "two-legged Shen Bao" I'm talking about is a special term in my hometown. It's not easy to qualify for this title. Most of them are idle brothers who have nothing to do and wander around all day long. Therefore, what they hear and see is more than others. If they don't get any news, that's it, but if they happen to get some news, they like to tell everyone, spreading even the smallest details, or even a dog fight on West Street or a overturned wonton stall on East Street, are part of their information. In practical terms, those people can be said to have no value at all, but they deserve the title of "well-informed." Furthermore, why don't people say "two-legged XX Bao" and insist on saying "two-legged Shen Bao"? If Shen Bao's news isn't particularly quick and superior to others, how could it be so?</p>
<h3>Bowl Clay Powder</h3>
<p>— (Ning Ziqiang)</p>
<p>Jingdezhen porcelain is the most famous. Although it cannot surpass Europe and the United States, it is considered the best in the country!</p>
<p>For any object, half of its successful creation depends on skill, and half on raw materials. If there is skill but no material, then there is no way to apply the skill. If there is material but no skill, then there is no way to use the material. They complement each other and are mutually indispensable. This is true for humans, and why shouldn't it be true for objects!</p>
<p>For example, the raw material for Jingdezhen porcelain comes from Qimen, Anhui, which is commonly called "bowl clay powder." Only with this fine raw material can exquisite pottery be created. When drinking water, remember the source; how can we forget the reason for its existence?</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Words</p>
<h3>Calligraphy and Painting and Mounting (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yin Qiu</p>
<p>Chinese calligraphy and painting are where the spirit of talented scholars resides, relying on paper and silk to be passed down through the ages. However, paper and silk are inherently delicate and must be mounted to facilitate display and preservation. Why? When calligraphers and painters are inspired, they pick up a brush and ink and wield them freely. Once a painting is completed, it is entrusted to a mounter, and its spirit and ink subtleties leap to life, inevitably appearing more outstanding than when it was unmounted. Therefore, whether it is a small piece of paper or a large piece of silk, mounting must be carefully considered, just like Western paintings must be fitted with an easel.</p>
<p>Mounters from Jiangsu and Zhejiang have long enjoyed a reputation for excellence. In the past, the Tang and Qiang families were highly respected. Although there are still skilled mounters today, few of them can follow ancient methods. Collectors and connoisseurs treat them with great respect! Because the same calligraphy and painting, when beautifully mounted, is icing on the cake; conversely, it is like putting dung on the Buddha's head. Or if there are masterpieces and treasures from previous generations that have been passed down for a long time and have become damaged and fallen apart, requiring re-mounting, then ordinary mounters cannot do the job. In the past, people compared re-mounting calligraphy and painting to seeking medical treatment for an illness; it is indeed not a false analogy!</p>
<p>When re-mounting calligraphy and painting, one must first examine the color and condition of the paper and silk. If the color is dull and the condition is poor, it must be rinsed and soaked. If the paper and silk are intact, they must be carefully peeled off and then slowly washed to remove dust and dirt. If they are moldy or diseased, they must be washed together with the backing paper, with careful attention. Some people use a loquat pit hammer to soak and boil the dirty areas, but after washing, they must be rinsed with deacidified water, otherwise stains are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Peeling off the mounting is not easy; peeling silk is still possible, but peeling paper is really difficult. If the paper is thin and the paste is heavy, or if white orpiment is used as paste, one must be cautious. If the calligraphy or painting is damaged, it must be repaired with the original silk. When repairing, the thickness of the paper and the fineness of the silk must be matched to be as identical as possible; even the paper grain and silk threads cannot be overlooked. The items to be peeled and mounted must have a "flying lining," which means leaving a two- or three-fen gap around the edges when lining, now called "leaving the seat," so that the original painting is not damaged when cutting and mounting with paste. When old calligraphy and painting have defects, old ink can be used to add a few strokes, which is called "completing," but it must be done by someone with high artistic skill to make it seamless.</p>
<p>There are many types of mounting. The most common ones nowadays are silk mounting, paper mounting, and sequential mounting. The style includes full brocade, half brocade, and edged brocade. The same applies to silk brocade, which can be inlaid, embedded, or hollowed out. The value depends on the cost of labor and materials. In the past, scrolls were mostly mounted with paper shells filled with sand to give them weight and make them hang down, but they were easily broken, so they are rarely used now, and wooden rods are used instead. The best ones are made of heavy and substantial wood, sandalwood being the best, followed by old fir. Fir is used for its dryness, and sandalwood can repel insects.</p>
<p>Scrolls with flat ends are called flat scrolls. Those mounted with scroll ends have mahogany scroll ends and horn scroll ends. Ivory and sandalwood are also often used. Occasionally, magnetic scroll ends are used, but they are brittle and easily broken. White bamboo carved scroll ends are more elegant and desirable. Jade scroll ends are mostly used for handscrolls, and the mounting is also flat, with ivory clasps attached to the beginning of the scroll, which is an old style.</p>
<p>The format of the mounting must be beautiful. The dimensions of the upper and lower inlays, and the width of the left and right borders, must be properly arranged, whether they are narrow and long or wide and broad, to match the calligraphy and painting itself, or to suit the location where they are hung. This cannot be generalized. However, it is forbidden to use a "poetry hall." Those who are knowledgeable about mounting never use a "poetry hall," even for small pieces. Using it makes it vulgar, and vulgarity is incurable. Nowadays, many people like "poetry halls," which is incomprehensible!</p>

<h3>Police and Garrison Basketball Team Defeated Donghua Last Night 52-28; Left Shanghai This Morning for Beijing</h3>
<p>The Wuhan Police and Garrison basketball team played Donghua last night in their final match in Shanghai. The Donghua players had not been on the court since the Shanghai Games ended, so they were extremely rusty. Their passing lacked connection, and their shooting was often ineffective. Their opponents, the Police and Garrison team, were all seasoned veterans, whose offense and defense were always under control. Their score steadily increased. At halftime, the Police and Garrison team led 32-14. In the second half, the Wuhan team brought in two new players, while Ge and Yin retired. With fresh troops on the field, Donghua became even more stressed. Guards Lu and Sun defended in panic, each committing four fouls and being sent off the field. The critical situation became even more difficult to sustain. At the end of the intense battle, the Police and Garrison team won 52-28.</p>
<p>The team played a total of five matches in Shanghai, with mixed results. Their performance can still be considered decent. The entire team took a train to Beijing this morning. Three matches have been scheduled: (1) vs. Lizhi Society, (2) vs. Central Military Academy, (3) vs. Military Art and Physical Education College. They will stay in Beijing for about five days and then take a boat back. The scores of both sides in yesterday's match are as follows:</p>

<h3>Public Exhibition Cup Handball, Third Round Starts Tonight at 6:00 PM at West Qing</h3>
<p>After the first two weeks of the Public Exhibition Cup international handball competition, the Chinese and Western teams have equal scores.

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Fund Office Sends Letter to the Finance Department Requesting That Provincial Education Funds Still Be Stored Separately in the Treasury</h3>
<p>Niu Yongjian, Director of the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office, recently sent a letter to Zhao, the Director of the Finance Department, requesting that provincial education funds still be stored separately in the Provincial Education Treasury. An excerpt from the original letter is as follows: "Upon investigation, the provincial education funds collected from the land tax of various counties have been directly transferred by the treasury to the commission for special fund storage for a long time, without any obstruction. Since the establishment of county treasuries last year, the accounting directors of Wu County, Changshu, Songjiang, Nanhui, Baoshan, and other counties have, under the pretext of unifying the county treasury system, refused to allow direct transfer by the treasury. They have instead submitted the provincial education funds collected from the land tax to the county treasury for storage, and then re-allocated them separately, just like local funds to be disbursed. Baoshan County even delayed the transfer of special funds collected in July of last year until recently. The other central counties also do not have a fixed schedule for allocation after the funds are deposited. According to the current new accounting system regulations in our province, the method for affiliated institutions and various collection offices to submit funds clearly stipulates that provincial funds should be fully submitted to the provincial treasury and stored in a separate account under the name of special funds. The county treasury is only responsible for the receipt and disbursement of county funds and does not extend to provincial taxes. Furthermore, Article 7 of the Interim Regulations for County Treasuries stipulates that county taxes, county education taxes, county construction taxes, county grain reserve taxes, and temporary taxes are all county taxes. If special accounts need to be added, the county magistrate should submit a request to the Finance Department for approval. Their accounting subjects do not allow for the existence of provincial education funds. This shows that their management scope is limited to the storage and disbursement of county funds. Why must the accounting directors of these counties overstep their authority and prevent direct allocation by the treasury, instead insisting on storing the funds in the county treasury? In the future, the reporting and transfer of provincial education funds will require the county government to sign checks and extract them from the county tax items, causing unnecessary trouble. Moreover, the boundaries are blurred. If the county government experiences financial difficulties, it will inevitably挪移 accumulate arrears. It seems that the establishment of the new accounting system is specifically to protect other provincial and county funds, while the provincial education funds, which have been divided independently for several years and have been managed effectively, are now losing their protection due to the establishment of the new system. This seems to be a misunderstanding. Therefore, I hereby request Director Zhao to investigate and instruct all counties and accounting directors to follow the various regulations and systems and continue to handle the allocation and transfer of provincial education funds according to the old methods, without any changes. If there are still any doubts, please refer to Article 5 of the Provincial Special Fund Custody and Disbursement Regulations, which states, 'The collected special funds should be fully submitted to the treasury by the second morning,' and submit the collected provincial education funds to the commission for separate storage by the second morning to maintain the needs of the provincial education funds. I also hope to receive a reply for the sake of convenience."</p>

<h3>Chunhui Middle School Will Be Closed Down</h3>
<p>Chunhui Middle School in Shangyu, Zhejiang Province, was founded by the late gentry Chen Chunlan, who invested 200,000 gold to create a school for the youth of the county. It has been established for thirteen years, nurturing talent. Recently, it was heard that a portion of the school board members have proposed to donate the school to the provincial government and transfer the funds to Datong Hospital. The Zhejiang Education Department sent Inspector Zhu to the school to investigate the matter. The teachers and students were in an uproar and organized a school protection association to seek help from all parties. It is learned that Yao Zantang, Yin Youlan, Chen Bangyan, Zhu Ziming, and other natives of the county living in Shanghai believe that the proposal of some Chunhui school board members goes against the original intention of the late Mr. Chen in founding the school. They have sent an urgent letter to the school board, requesting that it continue to operate, in order to benefit future generations.</p>
<p>Declaration of School Protection by Alumni: All Chunhui alumni, due to the recent proposal by the school board to挪移 funds and close the school, have organized a school protection association and issued a declaration stating: "Our school, Chunhui, was founded by Mr. Chen Chunlan and cannot be destroyed by others. The designated fund of 145,000 yuan cannot be embezzled by others. The school buildings belong to Chunhui, the facilities belong to Chunhui, and every plant and tree in the school belongs to Chunhui. Chunhui is the Chunhui of our alumni. All those who teach at Chunhui and study at Chunhui love and protect Chunhui. Since we love and protect it, we must preserve it. Now that some school board members are plotting to挪移 school funds and eliminate Chunhui, we, the alumni, vow to come out and oppose it with all our strength, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal. We hope that the education community and local people will be aware of this." Chunhui Middle School School Protection Association.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Student Circles Express: Since hearing the news of the closure of Chunhui, students from Shaoxing Private Jishan Middle School, Chengtian Middle School, Yuecai Middle School, and Junde Girls' Middle School have expressed dissatisfaction due to the matter concerning the future of students' education, and public opinion has been divided. Yesterday, the student self-government associations of the various schools held a joint meeting to discuss the course of action, telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, and telegraphed the Chunhui school board members.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Ningbo areas are also responding. Chunhui alumni in Shaoxing organized the Chunhui Shaoxing Alumni School Protection Association on the 10th of this month. Yuan Shunda and others initiated the effort, and they sent letters to alumni in other locations and telegraphed the Provincial Education Department. The telegram to the Education Department stated: "To Xu Junjian, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, Chunhui Middle School in Shangyu has a fund of 145,000 yuan. Some people are proposing to transfer and use the funds, destroying the school. Please immediately order a stop to this. Education is fortunate. Shun Da, He Minxing, Yao Xuanqing, Lu Zixiang, Ding Gongliang, Chen Hongda and others knock."</p>
<h3>Jiang Baili Publishes His Thoughts on the "Ten Declarations," Continued</h3>
<p>Mr. Tao Xisheng, in his "Wandering Fire Research," pointed out two different groups, which made me extremely happy. This is a major discovery in history.</p>
<p>And I believe that this point is the fatal wound of the national decline for three thousand years. After the failure of Xiang Yu's "gentlemen's society" and the deaths of Han Xin, the humiliation and escape of Zhang Liang, and Xiao He, an endless covert struggle between activists and intellectuals (莽换之's alterations and the literary inquisitions of past dynasties) has ensued. Within the intellectual class, there has also been constant infighting (the party strife of past dynasties). The most important cells of a nation have always been in a state of internal strife. Therefore, this has fostered two incurable maladies within the intellectual class: 1. Irresponsibility (The ideal for a scholar is to be a prime minister, not an emperor). 2. Detachment from reality (The transformation from the six arts of rites, music, archery, chariot driving, writing, and arithmetic to the six classics of poetry, books, rites, music, Yi, and Spring and Autumn Annals was a major turning point). For example, if the enzyme for brewing wine is bad, just like an explosion, if the electrical tube is wet, all the good laws, good intentions, and excellent products in the world must pass through this corrupt and dark door before they can enter Chinese society. The general cause of the ineffectiveness of all medicines is not here.</p>
<p>History has also seen a few painful cries, such as Gu Tinglin's advocacy of practical learning in the early Qing Dynasty, which was a resistance to detachment from reality. However, this movement, due to the covert struggle between activists and intellectuals, resulted in the ultimate failure of the factualist Yan Yuan Li Gangzhu, and it transformed into textual research. The spirit of textual research was indeed scientific, but in reality, it was still just a few dead words. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, Hu Wenzhong's monopolization and Zeng Wenzheng's "Upholding the Classics First Chapter" were both resistances to irresponsibility, but they only achieved partial success. And Li Hongzhang, who rose from the covert struggle, was still defeated by the great tide of irresponsibility and detachment from reality, leading to the heartbreaking diplomatic situation of today. The character of activists is fundamentally the opposite of intellectuals. Their strength is their willingness to take responsibility, but the result is often arbitrary. They are able to stay grounded in reality, but the result is often opportunism. Arbitrariness prevents them from gathering the strengths of the masses, and opportunism prevents them from establishing long-term plans. Both of these things are unsuitable for the development of a modern nation. After the Qin and Han dynasties, political power, military force, and knowledge were divided.</p>
<p>(Previously concentrated in the aristocratic class) Therefore, there was constant competition in politics, and the Chinese people gradually declined. However, under this oppression, our Chinese people (struggling for three thousand years) have done an amazing thing, that is, the work on things (I also have a special chapter entitled "The Chinese People and Material"). In terms of the spirit of struggle, it is no less important than the invention of the steam engine. From papermaking, printing, ceramics, lacquer, architecture, sculpture, to water wheels and weaving machines, there are unique inventions in every aspect. However, they are despised by the intellectual class, so there is no written record, and the accumulation of academic knowledge cannot be promoted. In the last fifty years, society has undergone great changes due to the influence of the environment, but its political evolution can be divided into several steps. The first step is the cooperation of knowledge and military force ((1) Intellectuals join the military, (2) Soldiers go to school to acquire knowledge, (3) Cooperation between intellectuals and activists in society). The gatherings, separations, successes, and failures in between have been proven by facts and do not need to be detailed. The second step, of course, is the unity of political power, military force, and knowledge. But what should be paid close attention to is that intellectuals still cannot effectively control material, so there is a fundamental problem in the life of the nation. And the reason why they cannot control material is still due to the two major weaknesses of irresponsibility and detachment from reality.</p>
<p>From Gu Yan's spirit of practical learning and Zeng Hu's responsible attitude, perhaps new life can be added to the enzyme detonator. But the new society has another element called "organization." The meaning of the word "organization" is that one thing is not the responsibility of one person or one institution, but each smallest unit (individual) takes its own special responsibility, and a kind of mutual assistance success is achieved in the application. This is the key point of the new economy and the element of national defense. We can now say that there are strong soldiers but the country is not rich, but there has never been a rich country with weak soldiers.</p>
<p>To say a complaining word, if students in shops and apprentices of craftsmen can read for an hour at night (that is, people who live in practical things and can acquire knowledge), I am afraid that they can bear the responsibility of reviving the nation. And those who take carpools every day and attend six hours of gong ke in primary and secondary schools are still just an appendage. And the scientists in books can only allow the overseas Chinese who are bound by etiquette and controlled by the agricultural patriarchal spirit to remit money back every year to support them in their old age.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Jiang spoke the following words with extremely rich emotion. He said that the declarations of you gentlemen are like the echo of a bell in an ancient temple in the deep mountains, which represents the feeling of loneliness and desolation at this time. I hope that they will be the pioneers of dawn. The conversation did not end until late at night. (The end)</p>
<h3>Letter from Jinan University, Published as Is</h3>
<p>The letter from Jinan University reads: "Dear Editor, I read the educational news in your newspaper on March 22nd, which contained a message about an academic lecture by the Vocational Education Society, in which it was mentioned that Zhang Yiping is the director of the Literature Department of Jinan University (according to the manuscript submitted by the China Vocational Education Society). It was also stated that Mr. Zhang is the secretary and professor of Jinan University. After investigation, our school has separate Chinese Language and Literature Departments and Foreign Language and Literature Departments. Mr. Long Muxun is the director of the Chinese Language and Literature Department, and Mr. Chen Linrui is the director of the Foreign Language and Literature Department. I am sending this letter to request a correction. Thank you very much.

<h3>Financial Markets: Foreign Banks Surge, Gold Price Plummets to $15.60, Foreign Banks' Rise Unabated, Gold Market Dominated by Buyers, Future Unpredictable</h3>
<p>The gold market experienced a sudden and surprising surge in overseas silver markets, causing panic. Yesterday's market decline was particularly severe. Banks and Sassoon maintained their positions, while other Chinese merchants were particularly cautious. The Indian silver market reported another sharp rise. Initially, overseas silver markets in England and America rose sharply in unison. It was also said that the United States would accept purchases at $0.0625 above the closing price. Forward silver prices also rose by more than one cent, and exchange rates all increased. London raw gold fell by 5.5 pence. Reports circulated that London was rife with rumors of a Sino-British loan of £10 million, further dampening sentiment. As a result, pre-market trading opened and immediately retreated within the $60 range. Major players emerged, short sellers gained momentum, and the situation appeared weak, with prices fluctuating downward. The Central Bank's benchmark price was announced, with both British and American currencies rising, and the Customs Gold Unit falling by 1.7%. The standard gold price was reduced to $897.80, leading to further declines after the opening. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to buy aggressively, and the foreign exchange market tightened. Major players actively bought, gradually pushing prices up, briefly breaking through the $60 mark. Foreign banks took advantage of slight gains and then reported a decline. At this point, because banks had offsetting positions, the market briefly stagnated, appearing stable for quite some time. Later, Dayun Company and others continued to sell, banks became sluggish, the foreign exchange market hardened, and Sassoon also sold. The market was inherently bearish, and the decline became more pronounced, with many parties liquidating positions, briefly approaching the $50 mark. Later, banks took advantage of the cheap prices to maintain their positions, floating short positions took profits, and major players also came to buy, gradually improving the situation. Sassoon then came back to cover positions. Rumors of favorable news suddenly caused prices to rebound. The market appeared stable at noon. The market opened slightly lower in the afternoon, but unexpectedly, Sassoon aggressively bought significant amounts of US dollars and shillings, causing panic. Prices rebounded briefly, but buyers, due to the Indian silver situation, were reluctant to linger. After rising, prices fluctuated. When the Indian silver market reported a rise of 1.5 rupees, selling pressure emerged, and Guangdong merchants also supplied shillings, leading to a decline. However, major players still came to buy at lower prices, stabilizing the market again. Unfortunately, Chinese merchants dumped foreign exchange, and Guangdong merchants also sold shillings, making it difficult to rally. Indian silver prices fell back slightly by 0.3 annas and rose again briefly, but sentiment was so weak that many closed their positions, and the market closed lower. After the close, the market even broke through the $50 mark. Although the overall trend was weak, there were many rallies along the way. The future is difficult to predict, mainly because the rise of foreign banks is still unabated. However, buyers still dominate the local market, with open interest reaching over 19,000 contracts, with 35 longs and 67 shorts. Here is a review of the day's market conditions.</p>

<h3>Recent Overview of the Hankou Cotton Market - Abundant Cotton Stockpiles Make Price Recovery Difficult -</h3>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The Hankou cotton market has been continuously affected by the sharp fall in foreign cotton prices. Market consumption has been greatly impacted, and all parties are hesitant to move forward. However, recently manufacturers have been actively purchasing. However, prices have fallen due to the dumping of foreign cotton. The four yarn factories listed on the market, namely Hankou No. 1 Factory, Minsheng Factory, Shenxin Factory, and Yuhua Factory, are all strengthening their efforts to purchase raw materials. As for the trading merchants, Chenfeng, Yihe, and Hexingyong three flower merchants, are also absorbing a considerable amount, but the number is very small. A total of 1,376 large bales, 865 medium-sized bales, 1,022 small bales, 320 large pieces, and 209 small pieces were transacted, equivalent to 7,791 dan and 90 jin in market weight. The sales volume was huge, the largest in nearly two months. Market prices are generally stable. The flower prices are listed below (price per dan in market weight):</p>
<p>Yuan</p>
<p>Tianmen Flower 32.45</p>
<p>Yuxin Flower 32.35</p>
<p>Fuchang Flower 32.40</p>
<p>Fancheng Flower 30.80</p>
<p>Dengxian Flower 34.70</p>
<p>Pengshi Flower 32.00</p>
<p>Xinye Flower 33.50</p>
<p>Xiaogan Flower 27.50</p>
<p>Furthermore, Hankou has 100,000 dan of cotton in stock, Tianjin has 400,000 dan, Zhengzhou has 200,000 dan, and Jinan has 200,000 dan. In Hubei alone, approximately 600,000 dan of cotton has not yet been transported out from the rural areas.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Rebound in US Cotton Prices - Short Covering... Japanese Merchants Purchasing -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with an increase of 2 to 7 points. Subsequently, with good news from Liverpool, Japanese merchants and economic merchants bought in, and prices continued to rise strongly. Midway through, due to selling by local and New Orleans traders and a sluggish stock market, the market appeared slightly weak. Then spot traders bought in near-month contracts, triggering short covering, which caused prices to rebound again. There was not much speculation, and traders were watching. In the afternoon, due to limit-price buying, short covering, and Japanese merchant purchases, there was another upward trend. Near the close, local players took profits, resulting in a slight weakening. The cotton exchange estimates that global US cotton consumption in February was 958,000 bales, a decrease of 158,000 bales compared to the same period last year. The close was firm. Spot prices rose by 20 points, and futures prices rose by 12 to 20 points. British cotton spot prices fell by one point, and futures prices rose by 3 to 4 points. Indian cotton fell due to selling by futures traders and profit-taking by bulls. Plain cotton fell by 3 rupees, and Oomra fell by 0.75 rupees. White Rawxi fell by 2 rupees. Original recordings are on the left (telegraph from the 25th):</p>

<h3>Rangoon Cotton Exports</h3>
<p>Mumbai telegraph of the 25th: The amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 2,230 bales, including 420 bales to Liverpool, 10 bales to Hamburg, and 1,700 bales to Japan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Market Conditions Show Some Differentiation</h3>
<p>The flour market opened this morning and was generally stable. Imported wheat was quoted, with Chicago near futures slightly down by a quarter of a cent, and distant futures up by one or two cents. Canadian wheat was down by about a quarter of a cent. With little fluctuation in imported wheat prices, only merchants from northern regions conducted some transactions. Furthermore, due to the imminent expiration of the current month's delivery and the current flour price being 5 cents higher, some parties were quite willing to take delivery. Distant futures remained unchanged due to the lack of offers from factories. By the afternoon opening, the market initially appeared slightly soft. However, non-industry customers, believing rumors of tariffs on imported wheat, showed some interest in buying distant futures, and the market also showed a firming trend. Unless there are unexpected changes in the situation, it will be difficult for prices to rise too high. The results were: current month up 2.5 cents, April up 0.5 cents, May up 7.5 cents, June up 0.5 cents, July up 7.5 cents, and August up 1.25 cents.</p>
<p>The wheat market opened this morning and was generally sluggish. Buyers and sellers, both within and outside the industry, mostly observed. On the selling side, dealers and those from inland areas uniformly did not hedge, making the market even more quiet. By the afternoon opening, due to the stability of the flour market and rumors of tariffs on imported wheat, sentiment began to stir, and buyers were also slightly excited. However, a solid footing can only be established after the facts are clear. The results were: current month up 2 cents, July and August up 4 cents. In the spot wheat market, due to the active operations of factories and sales by customers, high-quality wheat was priced two or three cents higher, while medium and low-quality wheat remained unchanged. 1,000 bags of Shandong wheat were quoted at 3 yuan 6 jiao 9 fen, and lower quality at 6 jiao 6 fen. Bengbu wheat was quoted at 3 yuan 6 jiao 6 fen, and were purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat</p>
<p>May 94.25 93.75 Down 0.375</p>
<p>July 91.25 91.50 Up 0.25</p>

<h3>Northern Merchants Slightly Active in Procuring Japonica Rice - The Market Ultimately Outshone by Rainy Weather -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of japonica rice from various groups were similar to before, with a total of about 23-24 boats arriving (a total of more than 4,000 shi). The local market was hampered by rain. Wholesale buyers were slightly active due to the convenience of shipping, with the Tianjin and Weihai groups procuring a total of 1,200-1,300 bags. However, in the end, the taste was not right, and the demands on the quality were stringent, so there was no major movement. The market remained weak, and the prices of various late-season rice and thick japonica rice were discounted by several cents. Other varieties such as Du Jian and Yinbian Yuan were generally weak. More than ten boats arrived from various routes in the Hebei rice market in northern Shanghai. Due to the cloudy and rainy weather, few shops put goods on the market, resulting in sluggish sales, and the market price of various goods was slightly discounted.</p>
<p>The soybean market was mediocre, sentiment was scattered, and transactions were slow. Lide Oil Factory bought over 400 bags of Guide soybeans for 3 yuan 7 jiao. The main destination was the local market. Over 700 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans were bought, with prices ranging from 3 yuan 4 jiao 7 to 3 yuan 3 jiao. In addition, over 300 bags of Shashi soybeans were bought, with prices ranging from 3 yuan 4 jiao 4 to 4 jiao, and 75 bags of Niuzhuang Baimi soybeans were bought, with prices at 4 yuan 1 jiao 2. Inland, 400 bags of Andong soybeans were bought, with prices at 4 yuan 8 jiao. The Quanzhou group purchased over 300 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans, with prices at 3 yuan 5 jiao 2, and the Ningbo group took over 100 bags of Zha soybeans, with prices at 3 yuan 5 jiao. Currently, only the Hankou Gao Zha soybean market is stable due to the scarcity of goods, while the rest remain weak.</p>
<p>The imported rice market remains firm. Given the current substantial inventory and the continuous supply, it will not be easy for the market to rise further. However, recently there have been widespread rumors of tariffs on imported rice, and some hoarders are no longer urgently seeking to sell. Yesterday, inland purchases from Saigon decreased, but the Jiujiang group suddenly became active, with a strong appetite, buying over 5,000 bags of various grades of Saigon glutinous rice. The Nanjing group continued to inquire. The whole city opened with nearly 10,000 bags of imported rice and 250 tons of futures. The Ke Xian rice was purchased inland at 800 bags. The market prices were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic and Imported Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend gradually stabilized. Regarding the tariff issue, sources from communication channels indicated that there seems to be a possibility of implementation. The guild's trading board quoted 17 yuan 4 jiao for spot 2-4 grade coarse granulated white sugar, but no transaction was made. Resale goods were traded at 5 yuan 3 jiao, down 5 fen from the previous day. Resale Dutch red sugar 8-9 grade was quoted at 4 yuan 8 jiao, but not sold. Taikoo Sugar B mark was quoted at 18 yuan 2 jiao. Mianbai Zhenyu No. 1 from the local factory remained at 16 yuan 9 jiao, and numbers 2, 3, and 4 were sold as before. There was a new batch of Chaoshan sugar on the market, about 300 bags. Ordinary Huanggang green sugar was priced at 10 yuan, and Huilai green sugar at 9 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen to 5 jiao. Over 400 bags of newly opened Zhizhiang white sugar were priced at 12 yuan 8 jiao for the higher quality and 12 yuan 4-5 jiao for the lower quality. In addition, over 200 bags of Qi white sugar were priced at 13 yuan 2 jiao, up 2-3 jiao from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Quanzhou Dried Longan New Seedlings Show Signs of Shortage</h3>
<p>Recently, not many Quanzhou dried longans have arrived. Upon investigation, only 400-odd boxes were imported on the Fudong Wheel the day before yesterday. Due to outside groups purchasing from the local source, the Quanzhou price has increased by 2-3 yuan. According to letters from freight customers, prices must be increased, and it is also rumored that the current longan seedlings are only 10-20% of last year's crop, so sentiments are quite high. However, as the sales here have not been strong, dealers are not greedy and their appetite is not great, the trend shows a reverse soft trend, resulting in no deals.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>The spring season is extremely important for the asphalt market because candle makers begin to prepare for summer production, and they must use the highest quality goods. Even soap factories, which use low-quality goods, also purchase at this time, so the spring sales are stronger than the winter season. In recent years, soap factories have mostly switched to using imported goods such as tallow and coconut oil for making soap. The domestic asphalt, the raw material for making soap, has been abandoned. The reason is that the price of asphalt is high, and soap factories naturally choose cheaper materials. Therefore, the only people who rely on asphalt are candle makers. Unexpectedly, since last winter, the price of tallow and coconut oil has also risen to over 20 yuan per dan, about the same as asphalt. Therefore, since last winter, soap factories have also been buying asphalt. As a result, the price of asphalt this spring is about 6-7 yuan higher per dan compared to last spring. However, the reason for the increase is not entirely due to strong soap demand. The large crop failures in various asphalt-producing regions last year also had a significant impact. With both the crop failure and strong demand, price increases should be expected. However, due to widespread droughts in Zhejiang province, the demand for candle-making has been greatly reduced. The drought in Zhejiang has had a greater impact than the crop failure. Therefore, although the market has risen, the supply still exceeds the demand. Last week, Machang oil in Hankou suddenly rose by one or two, while Zhejiang oil was still sold at the original price. If Zhejiang oil had not been selling to Jiangsu province, the stockpiles would have been extremely crowded. Recently, Hankou Machang oil has fallen back from 15 liang to 14 liang 4 qian. The brief price increase was temporary. Local dealers have no intention of following the Jing Gong agreement of 24 yuan per dan, but rather are selling based on habit.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Yellow Twill Sales Very Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wool trade was still strong, and the sales of yellow twill were very strong. Tianxiang Desheng pattern yellow twill was sold at 5 jiao 4 fen per yard, Yongle brand at 5 jiao 6 fen, Rongkang 55 brand at 5 jiao 1 fen, Hua Ji at 3 jiao 8 fen, and domestic Dafeng yellow twill sold at 4 jiao 6 fen.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Hard Lead Wire in Extreme Short Supply</h3>
<p>Hard lead wire, numbers 12 to 20, is a popular product for thermos bottle factories and the Ningbo group. Therefore, whenever they arrive, these groups must rush to purchase them. Although the actual sales volume is not large, it is a type of goods that plays a role in the market. Recently, although there has been a constant stream of arriving goods, the demand has been so strong that there is still not enough in the market to meet the sales volume, resulting in a shortage of circulating goods and high prices. It is quoted at 7 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen to 8 yuan 5 jiao per dan. However, due to the shortage of goods, dealers have very high expectations, and some are even asking for about 9 yuan. It is said that there are more than 260 loads for sale. Upon investigation, the goods expected to arrive in the next one or two weeks have already been sold, and the quoted price is said to be in the range of 8 yuan 1-2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Domestic Zhenmei Tea Sells Slowly at Low Prices</h3>
<p>The foreign-owned tea market in Shanghai has been unusually quiet recently. Domestic Zhenmei green tea still has over 7,000 boxes in stock. European merchants have been allowing Chinese tea merchants to lower prices to sell. Although telegrams have been sent, Morocco has not requested to buy much. Yesterday, only Xiehe, Tianxiang, and other companies bought 230-odd boxes, selling at 28-29 yuan, which is very cheap. In addition, Jinlong Foreign Company has also purchased odd lots of Fengmei Baozhu items split from large batches. There were no other transactions.</p>

<h3>"Remnants of Elegance"</h3>
<p>— Bai Zhu</p>
<p>Lin Zhengda (Jingzhi) of the Song dynasty wrote a volume of "Remnants of Elegance". It was a Qing dynasty carved edition that I bought from an old bookstore last year. It doesn't seem to have been included in the Qiangcun Series. This is a very unique collection of lyrics, all of which are paraphrased from ancient poems, fu, and essays. In the preface, the author says: "The world often takes Tao Jingjie's 'Returning Home', Du Gongbu's 'Song of Drunkenness', Li Taibai's 'Bring the Wine', Su Changgong's 'Red Cliff Fu', Ouyang Gong's 'Record of the Old Drunkard', and a dozen or so similar works, and sets them to music... But in the heat of drinking, the singer and the listener often become tired. Therefore, predecessors paraphrased them, slightly adapting them to the musical rhythm, such as 'Returning Home' becoming 'Shaobian', 'Listening to Ying Shiqin' becoming 'Shuidiao Ge', 'Record of the Old Drunkard' becoming 'Rui He Xian', capturing the meaning of the words, simplifying the complex, making them easier to sing and recite. Not only can they be used for entertainment, but they can also be used to imagine the high ideals of the ancient sages. I love them very much, and I often imitate them, forgetting my own ugliness..." and so on.</p>
<p>This collection paraphrases many works by ancient poets and writers, such as Du Fu, Han Yu, Li Bai, Ouyang Xiu, and Fan Zhongyan, totaling more than thirty pieces. Let's take a look at one of them. This is a paraphrase of "Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion," set to the tune of "He Xin Lang":</p>
<p>"The events of the Orchid Pavilion on that day. There were high mountains, lush forests, and tall bamboos, where all the wise men gathered. The turbulent currents reflected each other, leading to flowing cups of wine along the winding stream. They only spoke freely of their secluded feelings. Singing and drinking, it was truly a joy, tired of the sounds of pipes and strings. It was late spring, and they performed the purification ritual together. The gentle breeze was pleasant, and the weather was new. They spread their high aspirations, looking up at the universe, and observing the species below. Between looking up and looking down, they entrusted their feelings, releasing themselves from the constraints of their bodies. They did not know that old age was approaching. They lamented that the old travels had become relics, thinking about how many joys there were in life. Looking back from the future, it will be the same as the past."</p>
<p>The technique is indeed quite good, but besides seeing the author "skillfully" express the original work in another form, what else do we get? Wang Xizhi's emotions are definitely not his emotions. Wang Xizhi's personal social environment and the natural environment of the Orchid Pavilion purification ceremony are also completely unrelated to him. He simply moved the "paper" original to another "piece of paper." He neither resonates with the original author from the heart nor infuses the original work with new life. The purpose is only to "set it to music." This is like silk flowers in a vase, artificial fountains in a fountain pool, all fake.</p>
<p>However, the "originator" was not Lin Zhengda. In the past, Su Shi's "Shaobian" was a well-known example. Huang Tingjian paraphrased Ouyang Xiu's "Record of the Old Drunkard" as "Around Chuzhou are all mountains. They look verdant and beautiful. They are Langya Mountains..." That "Rui He Xian" is also very famous. In addition, Jiang Jie of the Southern Song dynasty also had a "He Xin Lang" in his "Zhushan Lyrics" that paraphrased Du Fu's poem, starting with: "A reclusive hermit alone. Hiding her beautiful figure in a deep place, watching the clouds and valleys. She herself said that she was from a good family in Guanzhong, and has fallen to living among the grass and trees..." It still did not escape the shackles of the predecessors. Liu Shangyou, a surviving citizen who came south, also had a "Qinyuan Chun" in his "Yangwu Zhai Lyrics" that paraphrased the "Former Red Cliff Fu," with the opening line: "In the autumn of Renxu, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, Su Zi sailed a boat..." This trend became more and more widespread as time went on.</p>
<p>People have mixed opinions about this method of paraphrasing. As far as I know, Shen Xiong's "Liutang Lyrics" says: "Scholars in Tokyo paraphrased Su Shi's 'Dongxian Ge' as 'Yulou Chun' to record the events of the Moha Pool, as seen in Zhang Zhongsu's 'Ben Shi Ji'. Lu Zhi paraphrased Zi Tong's 'Fisherman's Song' as 'Zhegu Tian' to record the scenery in front of Xisai Mountain, as seen in 'Shangu Lyrics'. It is truly simple and elegant." But there were also many who opposed it. For example, He Chang's "Zhou Shui Xuan Lyrics" said: "Su Shi's paraphrase of 'Returning Home' and Huang Tingjian's paraphrase of 'Record of the Old Drunkard' both fell into evil tendencies. There are many things in the world that are ruined by famous people." Liu Tiren also said in his "Qi Song Tang Lyrics": "The paraphrase style is not feasible. Not only is 'Drunkard's Pavilion' like chewing wax, but even if Zizhan changes the words 'qin' and 'pipa' in his 'Listening to the Qin' poem, it is still a dream from beginning to end." This can explain the opinions of some people. In fact, this genre is the most difficult to use. If you cannot infuse the original work with new life, it is even easier to "fall into evil tendencies" than couplets and rhyming. I don't object to borrowing existing materials to re-express, just don't be "confined to the old ways," without any innovation, because if that's the case, we already have the original work.</p>
<p>Such "Remnants of Elegance" were just the idle entertainment of scholars and officials at that time.</p>
<h3>Traveling to Minhang (1)</h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>The biting cold that people thought might come, finally did not arrive. The breath of March makes people abandon the foolish question of whether it is already spring. The name of this solar term, Awakening of Insects, is very wonderful. It is not only appropriate for hibernating insects, but humans, as animals, probably cannot escape the scope of this awakening. Of course, people usually don't pay attention to the Awakening of Insects, but they do celebrate the Spring Purification Festival, and they have changed the Spring Purification Festival to March 3rd on the Gregorian calendar, which is even closer in time. This solar term is very worthy of promotion because it is a season when people can travel. This year, that day happened to be a Sunday, and the weather was so good. Without even noticing that it was a holiday, people would want to go out for a walk. So I went to Minhang that day.</p>
<p>Although I have traveled to many places, I am unusually unfamiliar with the neighborhood of Shanghai, where I have lived for ten years. Minhang is one place I have never been to. Perhaps this is not surprising. In Jiangwan, there are elderly people in their decades who have never even been to Shanghai. So, there must be even more Shanghai residents who have never been to the unremarkable Minhang. There was no particular reason for my choosing to go to Minhang, probably only because it is located on the Huangpu River, and I could see the scenery on both sides of the upper reaches of the Huangpu River by taking a boat. The fun of traveling is probably more on the journey than at the destination. Traveling on water is even better than traveling on land. When I stay in one place for too long, I often take a short ferry ride to get a little taste of travel. The ferries between Hong Kong's Sham Shui Po and Hankou's Xujiazha have both been places I have lingered. I have also traveled between Shanghai and Gaoqiao in this way. There are probably many passengers on that ferry who purely regard it as a sightseeing trip. I often fantasize that if there were a floating hotel that would sail away from the bustling city every night, sail a suitable distance, and then return to the city the next morning, many people would be willing to make this hotel their home. There are probably people in Shanghai who live in Minhang and commute by boat every day.</p>
<p>During that sweltering summer last year, when the Shanghai Ferry Company was operating the tour boats on the Huangpu River, there were also special boats going to Minhang. I didn't pay attention at the time whether they were operated by the same organization, but later I mistakenly remembered that they were together. Before going to Minhang this time, I first went to the Tongren Pier to ask about the sailing time. The person at the pier told me to go to Dongjiadu. At Dongjiadu, I only saw the Shangnan Ferry. When I asked again, they said to go to the Kaiqiao Pier. When I wanted to ask more, that person said impatiently, "You'll know when you get there. The boat is about to leave, hurry up." I didn't have time to call a taxi to take me there, but the Pinghu bus to Minhang was also about to leave in about fifteen minutes, so I decided to take that one. At the time, I still thought there was another ferry. It wasn't until later, when I arrived in Minhang, that I realized I had been mistaken before.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the boat, the vendors, who are always present on inland river boats, immediately made me feel like I was on a journey. The boat didn't leave on time, but I can't blame the boat company. The passengers probably just like to take things slow. Even if they were willing to arrive at the pier on time, they would still argue about the taxi fare, take care of their luggage, take out money from their innermost pockets to buy tickets, and politely decline the farewell of their senders. Then they would slowly stroll onto the boat. How could the boat not wait? There didn't seem to be many people in the same cabin as me who were just going for fun, and everyone's attitude was even more leisurely than mine, probably because they were more culturally Chinese. The most distinctive were a few passengers or boatmen in the back cabin. As soon as the boat left, they immediately dragged out a table and started playing mahjong. As their mahjong game began, the seats in our cabin gradually became more spacious because some people who had been lying down gave up their seats and sacrificed their legs to stand and watch the game.</p>
<h3>Long Road</h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>What I love most is traveling.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is precisely because of the scarcity of travel opportunities that I love it even more. People always yearn in their hearts for things they have not experienced or have experienced very little; "freshness" attracts people's hearts.</p>
<p>But what I love is not necessarily green hills and clear waters and exotic scenery; what makes me even happier is the means of transportation for long journeys: things like boats and cars.</p>
<p>When stepping onto the carriage or the gangway, I can feel my heart jumping, so even if it is not spring, a spring smile will appear on my face.</p>
<p>For the past month, I have had to jump on the tram three days a week in the evening for a round trip of nearly twenty li. The tram has similarities to the train, with its long carriages, the steps and handrails for getting on and off, the only difference being that the driver's bell replaces the long whistle of the steam engine.</p>
<p>But this - also has its own charm.</p>
<p>When the rumbling of the wheels vibrates in my ears, and my eyes gaze at the city streets about to be enveloped in darkness, a waking dream begins. It feels like I am huddled in a corner of a long-distance train carriage, and with the rolling of the wheels, I am speeding through desolate mountains and fields, unable to see a single light, enveloped in darkness, touching only darkness. This brings a series of conjectures.</p>
<p>Imagining that unknown land and unfamiliar people. If it's not all for fun, a new hope grows even more in my heart: to cast off the old and start a new journey.</p>
<p>In the tram, I indulge even more in guessing.</p>
<p>This long-distance tram is particularly cheap. From Xuanwumen to Chongwenmen, there are many people, needless to say, but if you don't get on at a busy stop along the way, it's still not so crowded that there's no place to sit.</p>
<p>Because I catch the tram according to the time, I also happen to meet some frequent riders: office workers and students who get off work and school according to the time. Everyone nods familiarly, but doesn't want to exchange words.</p>
<p>Each time there are so many unfamiliar faces: soldiers and policemen in uniform, women carrying bags and bundles, old men leisurely twirling walnuts in the tram, delivery apprentices, and even third-rate actors going to catch a late-night opera...</p>
<p>Listen with your ears:</p>
<p>Today, they received a few dollars in salary, and at what time a robbery occurred in a certain city gate (and then they describe the process of catching the thief, which attracts the people sitting next to them to interject). When women meet women, they become eloquent, asking "Where are you going?" asking about their children and grandchildren, and maybe even saying a flattering sentence with a smile:</p>
<p>"Good fortune! Good fortune!"</p>
<p>That person then wiggles their pursed lips and smiles.</p>
<p>The leisurely old men twirling walnuts in their palms will ask the apprentice merchants about the market conditions, and when they hear that prices are rising again, they stroke their beards:</p>
<p>"This is terrible, people are going to lose their lives!"</p>
<p>First-class actors at least have a monthly chartered car; those who are mixed in here are mostly young actors who sing the first two or three acts. From the corners of their eyes and eyebrows and the expression in their speech, you can determine who sings the female role and who sings the painted face... "I have to rush to 'Zhonghe' tomorrow night!"</p>
<p>"What's scheduled for you?"</p>
<p>"The Mulberry Garden Meeting. You're the Caogiao Pass tonight, right?"</p>
<p>Having gotten used to playing female roles, even their daily speech and demeanor have a touch of femininity.</p>
<p>The butcher shop owner, covered in oil stains, dozes leaning against the window sill, drool seeping from the corner of his mouth; this is his rest. Children giggle at him, and some adults smile at the robust children in Boy Scout uniforms. The children still can't be quiet in the car, walking back and forth, bumping into people. Old women look at their thin, short clothes with trepidation:</p>
<p>"Aren't you cold, good children?"</p>
<p>At each stop, a few travelers get on and off. Newspaper vendors shout outside the tram window, selling small newspapers or evening papers for a large copper coin each. They are very lucky to receive the copper coin that is reached out from the tram.</p>
<p>The tram keeps going to the end, and people get off to go to their own destinations. The ticket seller gets off and waves to colleagues at the station.</p>
<p>The driver turns the tram around again.</p>
<h3>The Task of a Writer of the Times</h3>
<p>— Mei Junyi</p>
<p>Someone in the Chinese literary world once said: It's all as lonely as a desolate desert: there is no fragrance of lilacs or slenderness of lilies here. There is no melodious song of cuckoos or mournful chirping of cicadas. However, some have also said: The Chinese literary world is like a noisy market: there are all kinds of different playthings. There are "new era" "avant-garde" and "old bones" "enthusiasts." In short, it's dazzling, like a colorful market, each with its own goods, techniques, and means of deceiving customers.</p>
<p>All of this is true. From the perspective of quality: the "products" of the Chinese literary world, whose materials are "durable," "beautiful," and make people "look good" on, are simply as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. In terms of quantity, although there are not few "goods," and they are displayed in a dazzling array, they are all "counterfeit goods," "inferior goods," "old goods," and "untimely leftovers." There is very little that can truly suit the taste of the masses. Therefore, one only sees diversity without refinement.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a reflection of a certain Chinese social phenomenon. Under deformed phenomena, deformed things will inevitably be produced.</p>
<p>However, as a writer of the times. He must see these phenomena clearly. See his own work and task clearly, and see the requirements, tastes, and needs of the reading public clearly.</p>
<p>In the barren and cluttered literary world, as a writer of the times, he should put in hard work, remove weeds, sweep away garbage, and use his heart to cultivate beautiful and robust flowers and fruits. This is the task of the gardener. Therefore, heroic struggle is necessary. Humble learning is essential. Diligent work is appropriate. The creation of a writer of an era's literature and art should and can "reflect the era," "inspire the era," and "advance the era," powerfully express the true meaning of life, and powerfully create new forms of life.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on War (12)</h3>
<p>— Translation by Ye Yin from the work of Tokunaga Sunao</p>
<p>Brother Xiong was an extreme denier of war. The sparse beard that remained at that time was a souvenir of Brother Xiong's time in the military. He was a brave man who had served in both the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, and the wounds on one hand and foot were received during the Battle of Shou Shan Fort.</p>
<p>The blue bronze leaf medal and more than one hundred yuan in bonuses became the price of a wife who lived together for a long time and one hand; Brother Xiong, who had few relatives, became a disabled person without a wife or children.</p>
<p>The taciturn Brother Xiong once told his father a story like this.</p>
<p>It was four or five days before the Battle of Shou Shan Fort. It was when they were marching all night to rescue the soldiers of the Third Company, which belonged to the same regiment on the front line. Just as everyone was advancing along the railway, passing through the sorghum fields, they heard incessant gunfire from afar.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the increasingly intense gunfire, everyone's brains, which had been as tired as cotton from the forced march of four or five days and insufficient food, felt a sense of tension as if being tightened, and they naturally felt as if the sound of their own footsteps was echoing on their eardrums.</p>
<p>"Halt!"</p>
<p>The company commander said in a sharp voice. Just as everyone was feeling baffled and stopped, on the distant front line, the "wah" cries that seemed to be from a charge suddenly covered up the gunfire and other sounds.</p>
<p>The company commander seemed to ponder for a while: but, after sending out five scouts, he immediately ordered the whole team to "step forward."</p>
<p>It was unknown whether those charging were the enemy or comrades: but the situation did seem to have reached a conclusion, and the gunfire gradually subsided.</p>
<p>After stepping over the sorghum fields in one breath, there was a slightly wider plain that was very uneven: on the right, you could see the rails shining lonely, and on the opposite side of the dark depression, sorghum fields were still undulating.</p>
<p>At this time, the shouts of many people, a kind of "wah wah" sound, came from more than three hundred meters ahead.</p>
<p>"Lie down!"</p>
<p>The company commander immediately shouted such a command; everyone prepared to lie down, waiting for the second order.</p>
<p>"Wah wah..."</p>
<p>However, this kind of sound, as it approached, made people feel really strange. The company commander was thinking like this: needless to say, this was not a charge; but, if it were the Japanese army, then there would naturally be no need to shout when retreating. At this time, two scouts ran back to report to him:</p>
<p>"The front line has been occupied by the enemy. The × and × companies seem to have been completely wiped out..."</p>
<p>The company commander looked into the distance at the approaching dark shadows of about one company of people, and seemed to have made up his mind, shouting the command to "lie down and prepare to fire"; he himself also held his bayonet tightly and lay down.</p>
<p>Gradually approaching from three hundred meters away, and walked to two hundred meters away... but, he did not issue a second order... What was laughable was that kind of shouting. It was not like that when the distance was far; but, once they got close, it was really... an energetic shout.</p>

<h3>Russian Youth Gang Commits Crimes for Fun</h3>
<p>— Xiaomin</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 23rd, there is a gang of young people in Russia who specialize in committing crimes, and have even set up a general association to train children in the art of theft. The three leaders, all between the ages of eighteen and twenty, have all been discovered and executed. During the interrogation, according to the confessions of the individuals, they were not stealing because of poverty, but specifically to "have fun." Recently, the authorities have launched a large-scale crackdown on bandits throughout the country. In Leningrad alone, 4,000 bandits and 2,000 petty thieves have been arrested. Judging from this, there are indeed quite a few petty thieves and bandits in Russia.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia is a communist country. They have communal wives, communal property, communal care, and communal education. The social economy is completely centralized, and individuals have no savings whatsoever. There is absolutely no problem with food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. There are public places for games and entertainment. The people of other countries are clamoring about unemployment. According to the boasts of the Soviets, their workers are in a situation where demand exceeds supply. Therefore, being a Soviet Russian person is very much like working at sunrise and resting at sunset, not picking up things lost on the road, and not closing doors at night. Are they the people of the Wuhuai clan, or the people of the Getian clan? Although I have never been to Russia, my heart yearns for it.</p>
<p>Now, looking at the news reported above, it is completely beyond my expectations. The "fun" of young people generally consists of watching dramas and movies, playing ball, gambling, chasing the opposite sex, etc. I have never heard of using "theft" as a tool for "fun." Although our country is a communist country, its people do not have three heads and six arms, or different internal organs. I am afraid that they are the same as ordinary Eurasian people. Why is their "fun" so unique? When Mo Di saw the King of Chu, he asked the king, "Suppose there is someone who abandons their decorated carriage, and a neighbor has a dilapidated carriage that they want to steal; they abandon their brocade silk, and a neighbor has coarse clothing that they want to steal. What kind of person is this?" The king said, "This person must have a 'stealing disease.'" This is just a fable of Mozi's, but now I unexpectedly find that there are such people, which is really strange.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the Russian youth theft gang is definitely not "stealing" for "fun." It is either because of economic oppression or because of the unbearable pressure of political power. There is nothing to say, nothing that can be said, so they can only say that it is for "fun." This is the reality of communist people being forced to be unbearable by the communist government, which can already be generally seen. Moreover, in Leningrad alone, there are as many as 6,000 bandits and petty thieves, so the total number of bandits and petty thieves in the country can also be imagined.</p>
<p>Not only are the people of Russia like this, but even their government uses thieving methods. Since September 18th, Russia has taken advantage of...</p>
<h3>Before the Abyss</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>The empty, gray-white garden path stretches windingly across the withered grassy beach, like the arm of an anemic woman thrown upon a dark yellow velvet blanket, making it appear even more haggard and pitiful. The low, dark green junipers are perpetually imprisoned within coarse, long black iron chains; whenever a branch grows particularly long or extends beyond the iron chains, it is savagely lopped off by a sharp blade. They grow forever under stern constraint, losing their ability to develop freely. Though they stand in neat rows, they are ultimately cripples, decorative objects grown solely to adorn the garden. Yet, in this winter when all vegetation has withered and died, only the junipers can withstand the ravages of the seasonal winds, revealing a verdant and thriving color.</p>
<p>"Plants of endurance!" Having walked the length of the junipers and their parallel line of black iron chains, I quietly breathed a sigh of empathy from my brooding chest. The sky was overcast, threatening rain, and large masses of gray-white clouds drifted swiftly by. Alas, is not my own state of mind like this overcast sky, constantly crowded with layers of melancholy clouds, with depression and gloom entrenched in my inspiration, misty and difficult to dispel? I stood blankly beneath the Chinese juniper at the edge of the garden path, when three or four children, laughing and hopping, ran past me, so lively, like white doves fluttering in the breeze. This momentary image pierced my throat like a juniper branch, causing a sharp pain. Thinking of my own vanished childhood, a quiet surge of sorrow for the passage of time welled up.</p>
<p>Moving with languid steps, I crossed the grassy ground that resembled a dark yellow velvet blanket and arrived at the edge of the stream. The stream water flowed past indifferently under my melancholic gaze—</p>
<p>Time! Time flows like the stream water, time is like the shadows of wisps of clouds on the water surface, comprehending the rise and fall of so many things, those stars, seasons, bodies, loves, careers, green herbs, and roses! Awakening to all the occasional fleeting moments of existence. Should the youth of the end of the century be in a period of hibernation? Otherwise, unable to bear the melancholy and loneliness, they will degenerate into a dissolute and unrestrained life. Very well, the water must always flow, stagnant water will breed foul odors and mosquitoes. Young people; junipers, in this cold atmosphere, only the young can endure the pressures of the environment. I looked at the stream, I looked at my own reflection in the stream, and said, "Endure!"</p>
<p>Endure, endure in adversity! Every moment of silence is but an opportunity for a fruit to ripen, and unexpected encounters will always come. A breeze, a white dove, a lightly leaning young woman, all the slightest of tremors will give the afflicted a sense of effortless joy.</p>
<p>In a moment of confusion, I felt vaguely that I was lying before an abyss, dreaming a lukewarm and dry dream – this dream was vague, like duckweed floating in a dark abyss, seemingly drifting with the tide every hour, east or west? Completely losing my own will. However, this was certainly not a dream, but a real situation, this world, this life, an abyss, a dream. I hesitated before the stream. I felt that the steady flow of water was too meaningless. I wanted to pick up a stone and throw it into the surface of the water to splash some water, but the brave and upright park guard kept watching me. "Perhaps this would violate some regulation!" So, I lost this courage, and finally dragged my slow steps, still along the row of junipers and black iron chains, and limped out of the park gate. "Plants of endurance!" I still breathed a sigh quietly from my brooding chest.</p>
<h3>Rapeseed Flowers Yellow</h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>Mid-February is the most leisurely time for farmers. The beans and wheat in the fields, and the boundless rapeseed flowers, surge like gold with a gust of gentle wind. In this kind of warm and sunny weather, most farmers, after eating lunch, go to the teahouse to chat. Even the few who cut green grass by the mountains to feed livestock rest from time to time, casually singing love songs of "Sister, my love." The goat herding girls also sing along without any embarrassment. The singing seems to never stop from morning to night.</p>
<p>Near the mountains is Yan Village, which is actually named after Yan Mountain; it is said to be a mountain, but it is only a slightly larger earth mound. Green grass is everywhere, and a dozen or so goats wander under the sun. The goat herding girl lies in the shade of the mountain, messing around with the grass-cutting man, and laughter and songs are sent to every corner by the spring breeze.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, a clear stream surrounds half of Yan Village. Near the place where the village is about to exit, is the home of Old Lady Wang. Her daughter-in-law, wearing a serge jacket and pants, squats by the river washing diapers, as if too lazy, and several diapers have not been finished for half a day. Suddenly, her name is called from inside the house. She knows that it is time for the child to wake up and eat milk. She abandons the work in her hands and runs home nimbly. Her mother-in-law, Old Lady Wang, with an unnatural expression on her face, hands the child to her, muttering and goes into the room to chant Buddhist scriptures. She coaxes the child to drink milk, and her eyes involuntarily look along the stream: that place is where she and her husband pledged their love. She is the goat herding girl from the opposite village. Because the green grass of Yan Mountain is abundant, she comes here every day from the opposite village. In this way, she met a young man, and this pile of earth mounds became closely related to her.</p>
<p>It was during the season when the rapeseed flowers turned yellow last year that they got married. The wedding was exceptionally lively. Relatives and neighbors from both villages rudely made a ruckus in the bridal chamber until midnight, making all kinds of gestures they had made while flirting on Yan Mountain to win her coquettish smiles. The situation seemed to extend for four or five days.</p>
<p>In less than three months, she was pregnant. During the busy farming season, her husband always secretly came back once or twice to visit. When neighbors met them, they spread the news throughout the village as a joke. On the one hand, she felt ashamed, and on the other hand, she had an unspeakable joy.</p>
<p>Spring unknowingly passed away, and her happy days also disappeared like a flash in the pan. The cruel summer</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>day took away her husband. The former relatives and friends have all become enemies, and even her mother-in-law, who loved her so much, often cursed her on the street, calling her a jinx. A wife who has lost her husband is considered an unlucky person in the countryside.</p>
<p>From then on, she was squeezed into hell. She did not dare to leave the bedroom a step. She feared countless snake-tongue-like gazes. But endless, untrue gossip still poured into her ears every day. Sometimes her mother-in-law deliberately talked loudly to people, and the sound of the jinx was so harsh, even saying that she did not keep her chastity. Therefore, her only hope was the piece of flesh in her belly. She swallowed her tears and gave birth to a boy.</p>
<p>The countryside naturally values ​​boys over girls. Having given birth to a boy, she was given importance. But this was not her hope. She hoped that the child would grow up, and she poured all the love she had for her husband into the child...</p>
<p>But the second rapeseed flower season came. The songs of Yan Mountain are sent every day. She saw pairs of butterflies fluttering among the rapeseed flowers. The child in her arms only knew how to drink milk and sleep. She often stood still and shed tears in private. This distant hope cannot fill the loneliness before her. The lonely years of a widow!</p>
<h3>Ascending North Peak</h3>
<p>— Baishan</p>
<p>Having come out of the Yue Wang Temple, we had lunch at a small restaurant next to the Bixue Danxin stone archway. This is all that the lake tour guide told us, and the half-day tour ends here.</p>
<p>With a full stomach, I really wanted to pluck up the courage to run up to Lingyin, but I was afraid that, as the guide said, I would not be able to ascend North Peak. Tourists pouring out of the restaurant were all on the same trip as us. When the bus stopped in front of the Yue Wang Temple, they scrambled to stuff the bus until it could hardly breathe. The straps for hanging on to in the bus were not enough to be distributed, but there was no need to worry, even if the bus turned and swayed, everyone was already like a sandwiched board, and there was absolutely no danger of not being able to stand firm.</p>
<p>The bus traveled for about ten minutes and arrived at Lingyin Temple. The crowd entered the temple through many stalls, passing through a long stone pedestrian path, on both sides of which were also stalls selling miscellaneous items such as prayer beads and sachets. Dear husbands always buy prayer beads for their wives to hang on their chests. This kind of disharmonious image, as long as you go for a walk on Bai Causeway at sunset, is full of modern women with yellow bags for pilgrimage. Even our group of three, in that kind of military training uniform, are not people who can be found in temples at ordinary times. Therefore, the villas with red tiles and Western-style decorations are built on the shores of the lightly powdered eyebrow West Lake, and everyone thinks it is a necessary embellishment.</p>
<p>Our purpose was to climb the mountain, so we also bought three climbing sticks. Entering the grand and majestic Great Hero Hall, the incense smoke there almost made people fall into a dense fog. Entering the Arhat Hall also made us shed tears: although one of our companions asked about the well where Ji Gong raised wood to build the temple, everyone hurriedly went to Taoguang on the left side.</p>
<p>Moving forward along the stone steps, there are tens of thousands of bamboos on both sides, and the sound of gurgling water can be heard. Upon closer inspection, it is the mountain spring that has trickled down from the split bamboo. Near Taoguang Temple, countless bamboo branches were found with words such as ×× releasing life engraved on them. This thing is still a mystery to this day. If we had asked the old ladies with yellow bags at that time, they would definitely have told us a long history; but none of us wanted to do this. When we rested in front of Taoguang Temple, everyone used this as conversation material, and the result was naturally still equal to zero. However, I secretly thought that if there was a chance to revisit in the future, this unanswered guess could still stir our interest: moreover, knowing a little less is not necessarily the happiness of being a human being. I personally think so.</p>
<p>On the way up North Peak, we met many devout Maoshan Taoists. They all sat cross-legged on the corner of the road, without looking askance, and tapped the wooden fish rhythmically. The bamboo basket in front of them was filled with double-cent copper coins given by pilgrims, which was quite considerable. Becoming a monk is indeed a supreme way to relieve unemployment. Along the way, there are many sugarcane stalls, and the prices are very expensive, but they have climbed so many stone steps to seek high profits. Compared with the Maoshan Taoists who gain without labor, I always feel that these people are too pitiful. However, many of the ladies who take mountain sedan chairs to cultivate good fortune haggle with those vendors, and the scene is very much like the situation of weighing catty by catty in a small vegetable market in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Arriving at North Peak, the area near Hangzhou can be seen at a glance; that green jade belt with fishing sails coming and going in between, is the Qiantang River. Confronting it is South Peak. It is a pity that I did not bring the guide book, otherwise, if someone pointed out something, there might be more excitement. After a while, the red sun set in the west, and the Qiantang River was reflected in golden splendor, as if hundreds of thousands of small golden snakes were surging from the bottom of the water. If we could stay here overnight and watch the sunrise, there would be an even more wonderful sight.</p>
<p>Before leaving, everyone drew a lottery stick. Mine was the best of the best, and the Bodhisattva told me that I had a long way to go and to take good care of myself!</p>
<h3>Scattered Strings of the Lion River</h3>
<p>— Ding Weinan</p>
<p>My own life has been one of constant destitution, going east one moment, west the next, like drifting clouds in the sky. For the sake of friends, relatives, and even family, I was urgently pressed time and again to quickly set off and return to this place, our true hometown. Although it is thirty or forty *li* away from the land where I was born, it is still my hometown!</p>
<p>A leaping automobile carried me back to my Lion River. Several years had passed since I last saw it. Though it had been seven or eight years, familiar outlines were still deeply etched in my mind and could be recognized, even if some forms had changed. Back when I was a child, this place was known as a hub connecting eight provinces. Even seven or eight years ago, before life threw me into destitution, there were still many newly rich upstarts. The narrow streets overflowed with crowds of people. But now, it has transformed into a different scene, like a consumptive patient supporting itself with its own bones.</p>
<p>Refugees unable to return home wander the streets, eyes blank, waiting for good news.</p>
<p>Business is extremely slow. In cloth shops, very few people step inside during the course of a long day. The shop assistants are bored to death. But since the shop is open, there must be business. Everyone has to rest their hands on the counter, watching the passersby on the street with eager eyes. Many shops have changed owners, naturally after several vicissitudes. Several old established shops, relying on the capital earned in previous years, painfully persevere to this day, luckily avoiding closure, but their vitality is greatly diminished. Though they have large storefronts, the pain of carrying the ashes of disaster can only be understood by a mute who has tasted *huanglian* (bitter root).</p>
<p>It's truly strange, yet not at all surprising. A place that used to be known for its rice is now expensive, over ten *yuan* per *shi*. The poor cry out in misery. Many farmers cannot return to farming, leaving fertile land to fall into desolation. My own erratic movements and the transgressions of recent years have hastened the collapse of the countryside!</p>
<p>The boats on the river also have little business. The masts that once stood in a forest along the riverbank are now so sparse. I heard that many boatmen have changed professions because roads have reached into the interior. The reeds still stand on Monk Island, while the houses of families across the river reveal a scene of disarray and disintegration! The broad river water rolls down the beach in a vast expanse, and the gray-white sky seems unable to contain the desolation here.</p>

<h3>How to Find Amusement in Leisure Time!</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We have a question of utmost importance to personal life, a serious issue concerning the lives of ordinary people, and we seek your advice, hoping you can provide us with clear guidance.</p>
<p>We all work at a bank, and we are off on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. After a week of intense work, we naturally want to seek entertainment during this time of respite. However, we see our colleagues spending their time off watching movies, playing cards, or even dancing until late at night before returning home. This kind of life is simply unacceptable. Although some are better, very few can find proper entertainment to spend their days off.</p>
<p>We feel that after working to the point of extreme fatigue, we need entertainment to regulate our monotonous lives. However, we certainly don't want to do what others do, like watching plays, dog racing, or engaging in reckless card games. At the same time, we find it difficult to find what we consider suitable entertainment, so we end up staying at home on our days off, reading books, and feeling utterly bored and frustrated all day long.</p>
<p>Sir, we believe that there must be many people in our situation today. We feel that many young people are going down the path of depravity because they can't find proper entertainment, and this is very dangerous!</p>
<p>For our own sake and for the sake of others, we are writing this letter to you, hoping that you can guide us on how to find proper pastimes to recover from the fatigue of work. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Wen Yangqiu</p>
<p>Lu Dianchen (same as above)</p>
<p>Cheng Long</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The question about leisure entertainment raised by the three gentlemen, Wen, Lu, and Cheng, is indeed a serious one of utmost importance to the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>The purpose of entertainment is to provide us with a means to soothe our minds and spirits and to soothe our moods after we have become mentally and physically fatigued. Because a person is busy from morning to night, leading to both mental and physical fatigue and lack of energy, entertainment can invigorate our spirits, promote our physical health, and help us forget the fatigue of work. At the same time, proper entertainment can prevent the erosion of ambition, prevent depravity, and increase work efficiency to achieve career advancement.</p>
<p>Since the meaning and effect of entertainment are so great, what kind of entertainment can be considered proper? We can see that Shanghai is so extravagant and the environment is so terrible, but what ordinary people consider to be entertainment is playing cards, horse racing, dog racing, smoking, drinking, whoring, and so on. Is this our proper entertainment? No! These things only waste our time, wear out our spirits, and waste our money. This kind of entertainment is luring us down the path of depravity. In the past and at present, countless young people have been seduced by it and have fallen.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of proper entertainment. Here are a few easy to implement, for general reference.</p>
<p>(1) Exercise—Exercise can make the body strong, energetic, and refreshed. But we are not limited to large sports venues to exercise. In the morning, we can do morning exercises in a place with fresh air, or after work, take a walk in a quieter place, or find a place to play ball. These are all exercises.</p>
<p>(2) Music—It has great magic. It can make people feel happy and relaxed, and it can cultivate one's character. Music is indeed the best tool for regulating the spirit. In one's spare time after work, fiddling with it at will is truly full of infinite interest.</p>
<p>(3) Travel—Travel is an even more amazing form of entertainment. During the journey, we admire the beautiful scenery of nature, and we can gain a lot of knowledge that books don't provide. Although long-term travel is not possible, it is a good thing to be able to invite a few friends to run around in the nearby countryside during breaks.</p>
<p>(4) Watching plays—Some people say that watching plays is not proper entertainment. I cannot agree with this statement. I believe that plays with corrupt content or improper content are not worth seeing, but it is okay to watch plays with beautiful performances, edifying abilities, and correct themes. Because it can cultivate the mind and body, regulate the spirit, and give you a lot of experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition, reading newspapers and books, photography, chess, hunting, etc. are all very interesting and proper entertainments, but due to space constraints, I cannot read them in detail.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that this group of people can reform their past bad habits, avoid past boring behaviors, and choose one or two proper entertainments in pursuit of a perfect life. As for which type of entertainment your economic environment allows you to do, you must decide for yourself.</p>

<p>Opening "Spring Sorrow Tune"</p>
<p>The slanting sun enters the courtyard, piercing cold rises. In the empty, silent embroidered chamber, the treasure censer is warm. Reluctant to part, longing for spring, spring has grown old. Gradually, dream shadows are enough to dissipate the soul. Listless and ill, too lazy to put on makeup. Head drooping from wine, unable to bear being thin. Thinking of last night, when the lamp wick had just brought good news. But the joyous occasion is shallow and vague. How lovely the parrot, earnest, reciting poetry haltingly. But the swallow, sincere, telling of its sorrow again and again. Already the twenty-four seasonal flowers send messages. Only catkins and willow floss block the gauze window. I remember being carefree, the library quiet behind the curtain. I sent the sound of chess pieces being placed. I remember picking at the thirteen-stringed zither. The sound is as smooth as jade and as round as pearls. I remember peering with drunken eyes from behind the screen. The jade-like person awakes, the phoenix hairpin lying horizontal. That day, I hurriedly covered my sleeves on the Yangguan Road. The horse slipped, the fog dense, under the moon. Now I wish to send the luxuriant grass on the riverbank. To carry my sorrow straight to the short and long pavilions. I am only left with tailors like bees and butterflies, idle and listless. Stealing rouge to embrace the falling blossoms. Gazing until my eyes can no longer see the green of the smoke and water by the bridge. This year in the hall north of Botang, I tread on the remnants of spring. Resenting the Eastern Emperor for being so wasteful.</p>

<h3>Ushers in Theaters Also Have Hope of Becoming Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— Yiji</p>
<p>We commonly call them "seat watchers" or "usher," but every time we mention these "seat watchers," especially the ushers in major Shanghai theaters, we can't help but feel a bit of a headache, because their methods of extorting small favors are endless. What with melon seeds, fruit, handkerchiefs, they simply take more than the ticket price. And these people are so deeply entrenched that there is no way to eradicate them. But what we are going to talk about now is not this kind of person with thick eyebrows and large eyes, hands on hips, waiting fiercely for you to take out your wallet, smiling broadly as soon as their dark eyes see the colorful bills. We want to talk about the young men who shave their beards cleanly, wear neat uniforms, hold flashlights, and politely lead you to your seat after taking your ticket at the entrance of the movie theater. We want to distinguish them from the old-style ushers used in theaters, so we call them "ushers."</p>
<p>These ushers are also theater staff or workers. They earn their living with wages and do not need to extort or blackmail, so although they cannot be said to be respected, they are not annoying. Douglas Fairbanks used to be one of them. The late Rudolph Valentino was also one of them. George Raft used to be one of them. These three popular and handsome young men, unexpectedly, all came from movie theater ushers. There are also many other male and female stars, so of course this is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Before Ramon Novarro was discovered by the great director Rex Ingram and filmed "The Prisoner of Zenda," he was an usher at the Grauman's Broadstreet Theatre in Los Angeles. But who knew him then? He led hundreds or thousands of viewers to their seats every day, for many weeks and months. But who knew that this dark-skinned Mexican youth would one day shine brighter than the flashlight in his hand and become a star in the film firmament?</p>
<p>At that time, Rudolph Valentino was already extremely popular. His star had risen to an unprecedented height. He was the idol worshipped by millions of women. Thousands of theaters were vying for his works. His fame surpassed the speed of the Four Horsemen and spread throughout the world. Many anecdotes arose from this, some of which were true and some of which were unfounded. But in the end, two things are certain. One is that he used to be a bus driver. One is that he used to be a movie theater usher.</p>
<p>In the history of every career, there are many romances that can be talked about after tea and wine. However, the fact that these two great stars, Valentino and Ramon Novarro, both came from the same movie theater usher is also one of the talking points in film history. But the strangeness of the matter does not stop there.</p>
<p>On the eve of the filming of the great director Ingram's "The Prisoner of Zenda," Ingram suddenly quarreled with Valentino. Valentino was originally a person promoted by Ingram himself. Ingram was so angry with him that he vowed to create another male star of the same caliber. And because Valentino was just an ordinary usher in a theater, he suddenly remembered Ramon Novarro, an usher at the Grauman's Broadstreet Theatre who had a strong desire for film but was unable to find a way. He immediately called Ramon and resolutely decided to cast him as the protagonist of "The Prisoner of Zenda." His anger towards Valentino made him even more hopeful for Ramon Novarro. Sure enough, Ingram had magical skills and created a shining new star in no time.</p>
<p>Ramon Novarro's speed of ascent even followed in the footsteps of his predecessor. Within a few months, he became Valentino's rival. They were competing to be the biggest lover on the screen. In this way, a Mexican man caused women all over the United States to be in a state of infatuation and unease, and the entire film industry was filled with an atmosphere of Latin romance, which also made the average men follow suit.</p>
<p>How did they have this ability to win over women? How could they deeply understand women's psychology? It turns out that it was because they had been movie theater ushers. When they were ushers, they first came into contact with the audience and learned what kind of men they liked to see on the screen. In the halls and aisles, they heard the general public's criticism of men more clearly than others. Day after day, watching and listening, they were influenced by what they saw and heard, and over time, the movements of male stars on the screen that could win the public's favor were imprinted in their minds, so that they could perform with extraordinary skill.</p>
<p>This is not empty talk. Let's take another handsome young man as proof. George Raft is one of them. He is not Mexican, nor is he Italian, but he looks just like Valentino, so his style also followed the past Italian lover. But he used to be an usher at the Capitol Theater in New York. Isn't his "The Trumpet Blows" the same flavor as Valentino's "Blood and Sand"? In this way, the theater is actually a vocational school for creating movie stars. Therefore, I advise the average usher not to underestimate their position. They can say this... Shun was also a man, and I am also a man, so why should I fear him?</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Impressions After Watching "Escape"</h3>
<p>— Mao Di</p>
<p>"Escape" is an excellent work with a sound consciousness that strives to expose reality. Needless to say, the playwright's purpose is to oppose imperialism and resist Japan, while at the same time reflecting the painful situation of these refugees escaping in hardship under the oppression of imperialism.</p>
<p>On the vast desert, many refugees who were both frozen and starved, with no home to return to, were wandering. They had nowhere to go in front and no way back behind. The miserable situation of their颠沛 and hardship would make anyone who saw them feel sad, angry, and tearful!</p>
<p>Other things, such as the depiction of opportunistic philanthropists who only lightly moved a few beads on the abacus with the relief money they raised, and then safely pocketed it; the wanton enjoyment of playboys and the trampling of women; and the fact that refugees could not get thin porridge but were beaten instead, all made people feel indignant and aroused their passionate blood, wishing to take those scoundrels one by one and "stab them with white knives and pull them out with red knives."</p>
<p>But in the end, Wang Yin's慷慨激昂 speech and the refugees taking up hoes and spades to go to the front line to reclaim lost land became an unimportant ending.</p>
<p>The director's method is very skillful, and half of it must also be attributed to the authenticity of the background, such as the big fire and the escape, and a few small places where comparisons are made are also quite touching.</p>
<p>The skillful acting skills of several actors naturally helped the progress of the plot and made it even more colorful: however, the two songs seemed to be forcibly inserted.</p>
<p>We can say this: "Escape" has the flavor of "The Highway," but the former stimulates people more deeply than the latter.</p>
<h3>Reflections After Seeing "Escape"</h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>I admit that the script of "Escape" is realistic. Especially at a time when the entire nation is numb and insensitive to pain, completely forgetting the loss of thousands of miles of Northeast territory in the September 18th Incident and the destruction of Zhabei in the January 28th Incident, this script is particularly needed.</p>
<p>"Escape" begins by unfolding a picture of the nomadic life of farmers beyond the Great Wall, making us feel that this life is much purer than the noise of urban life. Unconsciously, we are filled with envy and a desire to experience this kind of life. However, this picture is eventually torn to pieces by the enemy's planes and artillery, and the farmers who lived and worked in peace are transformed into homeless refugees. Who has inflicted this pain upon us?</p>
<p>The men and women in the countryside show such filial piety in serving the elderly. Even in the midst of escape, they struggle desperately to protect their elderly fathers. The love between siblings and the righteousness among neighbors all make urban audiences feel inferior!</p>
<p>"Escape" also depicts how, in the midst of their flight, some villains with no regard for human life exploit the refugees' homelessness to abduct and seduce respectable young women, just as there were traitors who worked for the enemy during the Battle of Zhabei. Such inhumane behavior is so hateful!</p>
<p>While charities cannot be entirely dismissed, at least some of them use charity as a pretext to enrich themselves and abuse their power. "Escape" ruthlessly exposes the ugly face of these fake philanthropists.</p>
<p>Finally, "Escape" clearly reveals to us that the enemy is advancing step by step, and our only response is to flee and rely on charities. This is not our way out. Our only way out is to fearlessly reclaim our lost territories.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, "Escape" still has many unsatisfactory aspects in terms of directing and acting. However, we believe that the scriptwriting is conscious, and it cannot be compared with those film scripts that are indifferent to pain and unable to address China's problems.</p>
<h3>Reflections on "Escape"</h3>
<p>— Hengguang</p>
<p>Today, when imperialists are rampant and brutally seizing our country's territory with planes and artillery, the presentation of "Escape" is indeed a work that exposes reality.</p>
<p>The impression "Escape" gives to the audience is hatred for the ferocity of imperialism and disgust for the cruelty of war. The fact that it arouses anti-imperialist and anti-war sentiments is the success of "Escape." But unfortunately, at a time when the rural economy is bankrupt, there are tens of thousands of unemployed people escaping, and many disaster victims wandering. This widespread reality of escape is a fact that the screenwriter of "Escape" has not paid attention to.</p>
<p>As for the editing of the "Escape" theme, the appropriateness of the exposure, the round and passionate acting, and the rare outdoor scenes, these are all worth noting and praising. Furthermore, the exposure of Hui Shan's false mask, the ease with which girl scouts raise donations, the refugees' destruction of Dong's mansion showing the greatness of the power of the masses, and the misery of the refugees' lives are all cleverly and appropriately exposed.</p>
<h3>The Story of Carole Lombard's "Heart Laugh" in "The Runaway Bride"</h3>
<p>— Guocheng</p>
<p>Now, "The Runaway Bride," starring Carole Lombard, is showing in Nanjing, and what is recorded below is a story about Lombard's personal "laugh."</p>
<p>This incident happened in 1924. It was a terrible car accident in which the car was wrecked, and Lombard was sitting in the car. As a result, she suffered very serious injuries. Her face and neck were bleeding a lot, and her life was in great danger. At that time, the doctors were also worried about her, fearing that even if she did not die, she would become a person with a facial disfigurement for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>She lived alone in the hospital and felt very painful mentally, especially when someone came into her room and saw her strange appearance with many bandages wrapped around her head, face, and neck. She knew that they would leave and talk about her behind her back. She was determined to restore her original appearance. So she didn't care about anything and spent her days thinking about many happy and interesting things in her heart; but she couldn't laugh out loud, because if she laughed, it would cause her facial muscles to move, and this muscle movement would be detrimental to her wounds, or it would cause her skin to crack.</p>
<p>There was only one way, that is, when her friends told her some funny things, she would try to learn a so-called "heart laugh," without moving the expression on her face. She spent eight months like this, and her friends simply couldn't figure out her temperament.</p>
<p>Later, she recovered from her injuries and came out of the hospital! Can you know what the first thing she did was? That is: she used all her strength to laugh heartily. Because it had been so long since she had laughed out loud with her face and mouth!</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>India's National Humiliation (Clive Of India) (11)</h3>
<p>— Maode</p>
<p>While Clive was talking to Governor Pigot, he suddenly heard an Indian woman selling mangoes outside, wailing. He was suddenly touched and hurried out. The governor followed behind. Clive went outside and asked Captain Clark what the ragged old woman wanted. Clark said, "She has been here all afternoon and refuses to leave. She keeps saying that the mangoes on the other side of the river are better than the ones here, and I don't know what she means." Clive listened and suddenly had an idea. He smiled and glanced at the governor, then led the woman to the front of his tent. The governor and Edmund followed.</p>
<p>When the woman arrived in front of the tent, she respectfully offered Clive a basket of mangoes. Edmund shouted from the side, "Robert, don't touch it, it might be poisonous!" But Clive spoke in fluent Hindustani and talked to the old woman. The old woman then walked back to Clive's side and took out a pair of slippers from under the basket of mangoes and placed them in Clive's hands. Clive took the slippers and told Clark to give her more money and send her away.</p>
<p>Clive held the slippers in his hand and felt around them, then took out a small knife and cut open the sole of one of the shoes, pulling out a piece of paper from inside. He winked at the governor and Edmund, and they all went into the tent. Clive opened the piece of paper and saw that it was a secret letter from Mir Jafar, which read: "Cross the river quickly. If possible, I will join you with 30,000 men. I haven't dared to move yet. Cross the river quickly. Issue the attack order. When possible, I will come and join you."</p>
<p>"If possible... Wait until it's possible..." Clive muttered to himself. Governor Pigot suddenly shouted, "No doubt! It must be a trick! The monsoon is about to start. Once the monsoon starts, the tide will rise, and you will have a strong enemy in front of you and a flood behind you. At that time, you will be caught in a trap!" Clive also muttered to himself, "That's right, that's right." The governor then waved his hand and told Edmund to retreat immediately. He also instructed Clive, "Colonel Clive, you must not cross the river! If Mir Jafar does not come to join you, you will have 60,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry to fight against you. You only have 800 British troops and 2,000 native troops. You must not risk the lives of all of us on a single gamble... Besides, your wife is also among them!"</p>
<p>Clive said blankly, "Do you think I don't know that? I ask you, have I ever been defeated?" The governor hesitated and did not answer immediately. The monsoon may not come for two days... The opportunity is not completely lost... He then said, "First send a letter to Mir Jafar, telling him to bring his troops to meet here before the heavy rain. Otherwise, the treaty will be cancelled. This is my final order!" As he spoke, he frowned and said to Clive, "I'm going back now. Do you have anything to say or any letter to take to your wife?" Clive said, "I don't have time to write a letter. Please tell her that I have reached a crossroads. She will understand when she hears it... I really want to see her." The governor said, "I will deliver this message in person." As he said this, he said goodnight to Clive and walked out.</p>
<p>After the governor left, Edmund came in. Clive sighed and said, "Edmund, it seems like everyone in the world is against me. I ask you... you tell me..." As he spoke, he sighed again, because Edmund hesitated and didn't speak, but his meaning was clearly expressed. Clive then walked alone to the front of the tent and stared blankly at the vast river in front of him. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Two New Chrysler Airflow Cars</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Spacious and beautiful, famous in the market</p>
<p>According to Mr. Mardi of Mardi Motors, the 1935 Chrysler Airflow has long been famous in the market. Recognizing the increasing need for spacious and luxurious cars, two new car bodies with extended wheelbases have been manufactured to meet the demand.</p>
<p>The first is a refined and stylish seven-seater sedan. It is spacious and comfortable to ride in, providing unexpected pleasure. It can accommodate seven passengers without crowding. The overall trim and paint are extremely beautiful. It has the skills and economy of the Chrysler Airflow, and the seats are wide and comfortable.</p>
<p>The extended wheelbase is sufficient for manufacturing a more beautiful and convenient five-seater touring sedan. Therefore, the latest five-seater Chrysler Airflow touring sedan has been successfully manufactured and is on the market for sale. Its spaciousness is unprecedented for a car of the same type, which is exactly what is needed now. The car has a large trunk, which is part of the entire body. The car's beauty and practicality are thus further enhanced.</p>
<p>The Chrysler Airflow has been known in the market this year as a car with high skill and low cost. All its various features are also available in these two new models with extended wheelbases. Such as the simultaneous silent transmission, the new conical roof spring, the four-wheel hydraulic brake, the all-steel body, and the simplified ventilation system that does not obstruct the line of sight are the most prominent of its characteristics.</p>
<p>On the left is the newly released Chrysler Airflow seven-seater sedan with a long wheelbase of 128 inches.</p>
<h3>Dodge Also Releases Two New Car Bodies</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Freeman, the general manager of China Motors, Dodge engineers have always been known for manufacturing spacious and comfortable cars. In order to promote its established reputation, two new car bodies have been released. From now on, the various models of the 1935 Dodge cars will be even more beautiful.</p>
<p>The first is a seven-seater Dodge sedan. The second is a five-seater Dodge touring sedan. Both of the above cars use extra-long wheelbases. Other manufacturing is the same as those circulating in the market. The so-called seven-seater sedan is most suitable for those who need extra-large seats. Because it is spacious and can seat seven people, there is absolutely no crowding. Even the two passengers sitting in the passenger seat can enjoy unprecedented comfort. In addition, it offers many additional features that are very popular with passengers.</p>
<p>As for the five-seater Dodge touring sedan, its luxury is no less than that of the seven-seater sedan. It also has a trunk, which is an integral part of the car body. Because its wheelbase is extended, the space in the car has been enlarged. Not only is the legroom for rear passengers more comfortable, but the luggage space has also increased significantly. Therefore, it has truly discovered a new meaning in the comfort of car travel. At the same time, all the engineering features for which Dodge cars are famous this year are also available in these two Dodge cars. Such as independent front suspension, unibody all-steel body, four-wheel hydraulic brakes, new springs, fingertip transmission, and buoyancy engine installation.</p>
<h3>Car Electricity Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Chen Xing</p>
<p>Every component of a car should be used in the proper way and with the proper procedure. The same is true for electricity. The following are the points related to car electricity, divided into sections.</p>
<p>(1) When turning on the water, turn on the ignition circuit with a key or button. The pointer on the ammeter should point to the "Discharge" side. If the meter pointer remains motionless, there must be something wrong with the ignition system. It needs to be diagnosed and treated.</p>
<p>(2) When lifting or stepping on the starter motor button, it should be firm. Do not loosen or tighten it suddenly. A few seconds is enough. Do not overdo it, as it will damage the battery. In cold weather, the carburetor can be stepped down at the same time. In this way, the motor is easier to shake the engine. After the engine starts, it should be loosened immediately to restore it to its original state.</p>
<p>(3) After the car is driven out, even if the speed reaches 10 to 12 miles per hour, even if the lights are not turned on, the ammeter pointer still does not point to the "Charge" side. The car should be stopped and inspected and repaired.</p>
<p>(4) Use the horn loudly in the wilderness and quietly in the bustling city. It should be followed and must not be mistaken. Do not use it too much when it is not necessary, especially in crowded places.</p>
<p>(5) When driving at night, use high beams in the countryside and low beams in the city. Do not use them upside down or randomly. When meeting a car, the high beam should be adjusted to low beam, or even turned off, so that the other driver's vision is not disturbed by the lights and accidents are avoided.</p>
<p>(6) The electricity charged into the battery by the generator should be increased or decreased according to the needs. If you are driving a long distance during the day, the charging rate can be reduced. Conversely, if you stop many times, the charging rate should be increased. However, the average charging rate should not exceed 10 amps.</p>
<p>(7) To increase or decrease the charging rate of the generator, the generator cover can be removed and the third brush moved. Move it in the direction of rotation to increase the charging rate. Move it in the opposite direction to reduce the charging rate. In winter, when more electricity is used, the third brush should be moved slightly in the direction of rotation to increase the charging rate.</p>
<p>(8) The conductors and brushes of the generator should be polished and cleaned every three months so that the generator can work smoothly.</p>
<p>(9) The battery should be checked every week. If you find that the water level is insufficient, you must immediately fill it with distilled water. But do not add electrolyte. When adding water in winter, it should be done before using the car.</p>
<p>(10) The ampere-hour of the battery and the amount of volts. (For example, the Ford V-shaped eight-cylinder car uses an 80 ampere-hour, 6-volt battery) should be noted when replacing the battery according to the regulations.</p>
<p>(11) When the engine stops working, the ignition circuit must be disconnected immediately. Do not turn on the lights or press the horn, so that the battery does not suffer unexpected losses.</p>
<p>(12) The amount of electricity stored in the battery can be measured with a specific gravity meter. If the specific gravity is between L275 and L300, the power storage is sufficient. If it is L265-L260 density, the stored electricity has been gradually consumed. The method of using pliers handles to connect the electrical terminals horizontally to ignite sparks to determine the amount of electricity stored should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>(13) The vent holes on the plugs of each battery should be paid attention to at all times to prevent them from being blocked by dirt. The outside of the battery should be washed frequently. When it is extremely dirty, it can be washed with ammonia and soda water.</p>
<p>(14) The area around the electrical terminals should be kept clean at all times. If dirt occurs, use a flat fine file to scrape it off and clean it, and then apply Vaseline to minimize corrosion.</p>
<p>(15) If the battery consumes too much water, the charging rate is too high. At this time, the charging rate of the generator should be reduced. If the specific gravity is too low, the electricity supplied by the generator is insufficient. At this time, the charging rate should be increased.</p>
<p>(16) If the vehicle is not used for a long time, the wires installed on the positive and negative terminals of the battery must be loosened. Each battery should also be filled with distilled water. When reinstalling, the grounding (either positive or negative) should follow the original regulations. There must be no mistakes. After reinstalling, the clamp should be locked tightly to prevent the battery from being shaken violently.</p>
<p>(17) In winter, the battery should always be kept with a sufficient amount of electricity. The specific gravity must be at least L250 density. Otherwise, there is a risk of freezing.</p>
<p>(18) The plugs of each battery must be tightened to prevent the electrolyte from spilling out. The electrolyte is acidic. Do not pour it on the car paint and cushions to avoid damage.</p>
<p>(19) The leather wires connecting the spark plugs on the distributor cover are installed according to the firing order of the cylinders. Do not change them arbitrarily.</p>
<p>(20) For new cars, the timing of the spark is mostly self-adjusted. If it is not automatic, when starting the engine, the spark button must be placed in the latest position. When the engine speed increases, the spark button should also be placed in an earlier position.</p>
<p>(20) (1) If the power-off point in the distributor is burned out, causing uneven firing, a file for making clocks or jewelry can be inserted into the contact point, and the two contact surfaces can be pressed flat with your fingers. This is the best method. Avoid grinding with a file whenever possible.</p>
<p>(22) If the specially made tubular leather wire connector on the distributor cover is soaked in oil or water, it can hinder the firing work. Therefore, you must be careful to prevent it. If it is accidentally stained, it should be wiped clean with a dry cloth immediately.</p>
<p>(23) The spark plugs must be inspected frequently. If the magnets are covered with carbon deposits, they must be scraped off with a small knife and washed with gasoline. If the gap is too wide or too narrow, it should be adjusted. The proper gap is about twenty-five thousandths of an inch.</p>
<p>(24) After the car has traveled 10,000 miles, it is best to replace the spark plugs with new ones. Because spark plugs are easy to break, replacing them with new ones can make the engine work smoothly and increase the power produced.</p>
<p>(25) The voltage and candlepower of the bulb must be in accordance with the original regulations. When replacing, you should pay attention. Do not replace them casually.</p>
<p>(26) There are oil holes and oil cups next to the generator and distributor. Every five hundred or one thousand miles, the engine oil should be filled once.</p>
<p>(27) Do not allow the water used to wash the car to soak the wires, the spark plug installation on the cylinder head, and other electrical components, causing leakage and hindering their work.</p>
<p>(28) If the wires and cables are slightly damaged, they must be replaced immediately. Otherwise, wrapping them with tape can also be used temporarily.</p>
<p>(29) You should inspect all wire connectors from time to time to see if they are loose. A Inspect the wires connecting the spark plugs. B Inspect the wires connecting the step-up box. C Inspect the wires connecting the generator and circuit breaker. D Inspect the wires connecting the starter motor and battery. L Wires connected to the dashboard.</p>
<p>(30) If the engine has stopped running and the lights have also been turned off, but the ammeter pointer still points to "Discharge," then you can choose one of the battery's electrical terminals and remove its connection wire. At this time, if the meter pointer goes to "0," there must be a leakage in the electrical system. It should be repaired.</p>
