<p>時評</p>
<h3>中歐公約與德奧關係</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>自去年以來。歐洲多事之區。莫過於中歐。如德國國社黨之窺伺奧政。屢肇變故。意南南匈關係之緊張。幾釀戰禍。故此一區域。謂為歐洲之一火藥庫。亦不為過。再則回顧去年中歐糾紛中之共同現象。即無論德之對奧。意匈之對南。皆有援助異國政治徒黨。於他國境内造成恐怖局面。藉收漁利之跡象。唯奧國則獲意之助。故能屢靖内難。而意南南匈之關係。亦以法國之調解。得以化險為夷。然中歐和平之始基。實建於最近羅馬之注意恊定之上。而其具體表現。即為今日各方磋商中之中歐公約。此約之内容何若。今雖猶未詳悉。唯就歷次之歐電所傳。實含二大要義。即（一）為互不干涉他國之内政。（二）互相保障和平。觀此二義。可知中歐公約之産生。實為一年來中歐之國際形勢所招致。而其所標揭之二義。亦為針對中歐此種國際環境而發。故此約若能成立。則中歐局勢。自能趨於安定。蓋意匈若無陰庇南國恐怖黨干涉南國内政之行動。即不致以武力乘人之危。而發生嚴重之變故。而德國若能暫時放棄其援助奧籍國社黨之行動。及其合併奧國之野心。則中歐一切禍亂。自必無從發作也。</p>
<p>就今日意南南匈等之融洽關係而觀。可知此等國家。皆已凖備接受此一公約。唯德國目下是否甘於放棄其圖奧之野心。尚難下一斷言。蓋德奧為同文同種之民族。德奧合併。不僅為德國一方之願望。亦為不少奧人之願望。且自經濟上言。奧國亦以與德合併為得計。加之奧國人口。僅及德國十分之一。國力懸殊特甚。故德即圖奧。苟無國際阻力。取之極易。最近薩爾投票結果。物歸故主。奧人聞之。亦都欣喜欲狂。因此。德方遂有主張亦以投票方法解决奧國歸屬問題之宣傳。於此可見奧國安全之保障。實較中歐任何國家為難。亦唯如此。故中歐公約。雖為中歐全部國家之問題。然關心最切者。則為奧國也。觀此可知奧總理奧外長之分訪法英。不為無故矣。</p>
<p>據連日歐電所傳。謂休士尼格屢言奧若不得確實保障。行將復辟。以抗德國勢力之侵陵。並謂奧國復辟。目前實有必要。又傳中歐公約如列入條欵。禁止哈布斯堡皇室復辟。將遭奧政府之反對。由此可知德奧合併。絶難實現。奧國政局。不甚安定。而中歐公約之於奧。其利害關係。實在任何中歐國家之上。必俟將來中歐公約成立。並由列强予奧以確實之保障。則奧之政局方可進趨穩定也。</p>

<h3>讀賣新聞社長被刺之原因</h3>
<p>（日本通信）</p>
<p>二月二十二日午前八時四十分、讀賣新聞社長正力松太郎、在該社門口、忽遇暴客、用日本刀刺左耳一刀、傷勢甚重、當即由該社診療所醫士五人、施行包紥手術、流血雖多、幸未傷及頸動脈、故經輸血一次之後、經過尚不十分惡劣、</p>
<p>犯人名長崎勝助、原籍九州之熊本縣、年三十歳、曾在警察教習所卒業、任王子署廵查、柔道技術頗精、奉國家中心主義、故加入神武會、現住神武會柔道練習塲、該會會長熱田佐家内、岀事逃岀後、即自行往「丸之内」警署自首、</p>
<p>綜合官方公表及讀賣新聞社所推測之原因、長崎之刺正力氏、第一係借此沽譽、以為將來活動之起點、第二讀賣新聞去年招聘美國野球團在明治神宫外苑表演、冒凟神宫尊嚴、第三該新聞社對「人權蹂躪」問題、（即三土·中島·黑田·等被檢舉案、監獄中虐待拷打事、引起議院中質問、）特予同情、第四讀賣新聞社中有若干自由思想者、在言論難免有所表示、一九三二年十二月間、上智大學曉星中學為宗教關係、不肯參拜靖國神社、為軍部所不滿、當時讀賣新聞對於此事、曾予該校以多少同情、因此激動神武會反感、並曾散佈傳單、攻擊上智曉星兩校、令其登報謝罪、此次行刺該社社長正力氏之長崎、自認係個人單獨行動、絶未與熱田及其他任何人同謀、警廳如此公佈、讀賣新聞社亦如此承認、</p>

<p>近來日本各愛國團體中之活動分子、往往到處講演、宣傳一九三五六年之危機、除敷陳國際關係之嚴重、力贊軍備之擴張、對内則痛述都市上中小工商業者之苦痛、金融資本之横暴、農村經濟之困難、農民生活之不能維持、高倡「打倒特權階級、財産奉還天皇、」等口號、左傾的「地下運動」、表面上十分沉寂、思想之散佈則殊廣泛、而極右派之分子亦復廣播於各處、大都市固無論矣、即邊僻農村亦有組織、其勢力甚大、此亦留心日本社會情形者值得注意之事也、（二月二十三日於東京）</p>

<p>人員不主調動　至於内部人員、將來大致無甚調動、黄委員長治事態度、向主對事不對人、現除總務司長已經政府任命葛敬猷外、餘人均一仍其舊、繼續任用、俾資熟手、黄委員長以身體欠佳、臂鼻各症未痊、故往莫干山小住、作相當時間休養、何時晋京就任内長兼職、大約尚未决定、</p>
<p>華北日益安定　旋記者叩以華北情形、許氏初謂、本人在北方地位、僅為一政整會參議、乃帮忙性質、不負任何直接責任、惟可就從旁觀察所及、一一為君告、於是許氏乃暢談、現察東事件、經日方之諒解讓步、業已完全解决無事、自華北人心曾一度為之騷動之問題、得以解决後、復日益安定矣、有一點可資證明者、即廢曆新正之迎神賽會舊俗、四五年來、冷淡從事、獨今年熱閙非常、自元旦以至十五日、日日爆竹連天、甚或通宵達旦、是殆即人民心理已經安定之現象也、</p>
<p>河北去年豐收　若農村經濟、亦已漸次復興、去年河北豐收、河北本棉麥産區、自戰事失耕而後、年來以黄委員長之竭力安撫、人民恢復安居樂事、故去年河北棉産大熟、現河北佔全國各省産棉之首位、財政方面、亦以多方撙節、而不感恐慌、除地方本身税收範圍外、中央項下所撥予補者無多、現年不過約二三百萬、以上係就内政方面而言者、</p>
<p>戰區交涉進行　再就外交方面言、關於戰區各項未了交涉、自組織戰區淸理委員會進行以來、現大致均已成熟、日方人員、如梅津高橋若杉等氏、皆能諒解我方情形、希望和平解决一切、使中日外交、走入正軌、高橋並已定於三月初、岀關與關東軍方面接洽、所有各問題、俟高橋岀關接洽後返平、大約即可一一解决、而告完全結束、至所謂各該問題之中心、即戰區土匪之擾亂、舊保安之不良、及日鮮浪人之不軌、如販賣白麵等情事、</p>
<p>平政整會近况　許氏並談及平政整會近况、謂自黄委員長南下以來、現會務統由王總參議（克敏）代拆代行、王氏久歷政事、為人極穩健、與各方感情甚睦、自屬得人、其秘書長一職、何其鞏氏辭去後、由俞嘉基氏繼任、俞氏到任已久、治事亦頗具精神、黄膺白先生一身兼任整委會委員長及内政部長、亦猶何敬之部長兼任軍分會委員長及軍政部長、本無問題、將來大可隨時往來於京平間也云云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （妙神）</p>
<p>蘇州公安局雇用之掃街夫，每月工次僅五六元，除去伙食外，實際上每月僅得數角，且掃帚等掃街工具，尚須自備。</p>
<p>日昨淸晨，在新世界前候電車，有鄉人五六人，匍匐階前，狀殊觳觫詢之，謂由海門逃荒而來，家中有田十餘畝，本可，飽暖無憂，乃去歳旱魃為災，田中粒米無收，家無擔石之儲，三餐何能或缺，不得已來滬找尋親友，言下，不勝其唏噓歎息。</p>
<p>江西匪區，滿目荒凉，人民飄泊流離，終日難求一飽，賣孩鬻妻之事，司空見慣，而人口價格，每歳僅值一元云。</p>
<p>有人將年輕女子送入唐山之某當肆質當，某當肆竟視女子為貨物，允其所請，開典當界之奇聞。</p>
<h3>國産紙張的没落</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>近來，提倡國貨的聲浪，真是高唱得如入雲霄，去年公定為婦女國貨年，今年又公决為學生國貨年，大家拿岀全副的精神，為國貨謀生路，這自然是值得欽佩的。至於各大報紙呢？除了專岀國貨週刋之外，更儘量的刋載關於國貨方面的調查和統計，這當然是一件很有價值的事。</p>
<p>不過，我總覺得：提倡國貨的聲浪，雖如此高漲，然而國産紙張的没落，倒也有着顯著的表現，細推其因，實由於一般文友，喜用外國報紙以及外國道林紙來寫稿的原因，我覺得：最最矛盾的，便是用派克自來水筆，外國道林紙，來寫提倡國貨的文字，一方面固然是在勸人服用國貨，然而自己却在做外貨的推銷員，這不是一件滑稽的事嗎？</p>
<p>從前本欄沙君説：「中國的毛筆，已到了没落的程度，數千萬的毛筆工友，將有凍餓失業之憂。」這是的確的。可是，毛筆如此，國産紙張，又何甞不如此呢？大家都喜歡用外國貨的紙張來寫東西，國産的紙張，實在也到了没落的程度了，同樣，依靠着國産造紙廠吃飯的許多工友，以及他們的父兄妻子，不是也有了失業凍餓的危險嗎？</p>
<p>我很希望大家從今而後，不要忽略這種小地方，古人説：「勿以善小而不為。」個個人從小善做起，便是一個大善。又説：「勿以惡小而為之。」個個人存了這個念願，便是一種大惡。我們對於提倡國貨的毛筆和紙張上，也應該作如是觀。</p>
<h3>羊城三次會耆英</h3>
<p>— 望雲</p>
<p>在這敬老時代，廣州市政府舉行的耆英會，一而再，再而三，贏得會中這幾位克享大年的老古董，活蟹活蟹的笑個不住，幸而他們都没有牙齒，否則牙齒都要笑掉了。民二四年二月十五日，便是老公公老婆婆第三次岀風頭的日子，在市政府禮堂參加的約有三百人之多，由劉紀文市長及局長職員，擔任招待一切，所備的酒筵約有五六十席，在座的没有一個不是白髮飄飄的人，鳩杖上面，都貼了號數，以便散席後對號取杖，這盈束的拐杖聚在一處，好像擺了一個甘蔗攤兒。</p>
<p>居中一席，坐的是年嵗最高的百零七歳張蘇氏，及百零一嵗的黄偉。劉市長和夫人許淑珍殷勤進酒，市府音樂隊一再奏樂。張蘇氏的代表麥甯，登禮堂主席臺略致謝詞，恭頌本省市當局，陳總司令，林主席，劉市長的德政，以及愛護耆老的盛意。是日菜餚，都是軟性的東西，火候到界，合於没牙齒的人的口胃。席散以後，老人簡而文親書「錦市昇平」四個字。筆力蒼勁，是題贈劉市長的。吾想這四字還不算好，最好寫「没齒不忘」四字，表示没牙齒的不忘大德。那便來得貼切了。</p>
<h3>兒童年之先决問題</h3>
<p>— 作　士英</p>
<h3>撲滿</h3>
<p>— 吴雅非</p>
<p>我雖不是小孩子，然而却有小孩子的脾氣；的確，我的舉動太像小孩子了。</p>
<p>因為我的生活太隨便了的縁故，所以在經濟上時有入不敷岀之虞；手頭一有了錢，就任意揮霍，毫不肯加以儲積，也不會想到没有錢時的痛苦。吃，玩，穿，一些兒不吝惜的，把汗血換來的錢，從手裏滑岀去；等到囊空如洗的時候，正經錢反而要去向朋友挪借，向親戚告貸，甚至于當衣服。這樣一年一年的過去，所以每逢節邊年關，總是急的要命，無法應付的。朋友地方失去信用，親戚方面送我白眼；可是我雖然年年總要受一二次大窘，但老脾氣終于不知悛改，不知懺悔，依然我行我素，得過且過。</p>
<p>自從去年起，我肩頭上突然加了一條不輕不重的生活擔子，並且為了市面不景氣，錢又難找；而前年失業後，流浪街頭的滋味，還没有忘掉。因此便想到錢之得來不易，用去自應格外謹慎，於是下了一個决心，要設法積些零錢起來，以備不時之需。有一天，我從窑貨店裏去買來了三隻黄砂撲滿；祗須手頭一遇到有角子便丢在裏面，有時想去看電影或買零食吃，就也不看不吃，把錢放進撲滿。也有幾次，將省下來的車錢放在裏邊。待到去年年終，我將三只撲滿鄭鄭重重的敲破了，共得雙毫六百多枚，合大洋一百多元；所以這一個年關非但安然度過，而且還落得口袋裏麥克麥克。這些錢都是從日常消耗中省下來的</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咜未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>在旁邊坐着的張介夫，也不免去偷看賈多才的模樣，這兩位先生，先是没有話説。胡氏是個未投入現代社會的人，他也不能開口。月英呢，若是把這裏當商品交易而論，他就是商品，作商品的，那還有什麽可説呢？因之屋子裏雖然是坐着四個人，這聲音倒是寂然了。張介夫是心裏没有事的人，他首先醒悟過來了，這就向賈多才道，喂！仁兄，你不是可以替他想法子的嗎？賈多才身子一縮，好像吃了一驚的樣子，這就算是他真正的醒過來。因笑道：我那裏知道他娘兒兩個碰了釘子，還不是你説的嗎？我能够想的法子，不就是那麽一點？我是無所謂，有什麽説不岀來的，只是他們當了面，恐怕有些難為情。他吞吞吐吐的説了個半明白不明白，胡氏根本就不知所説什麽，只瞪了大眼睛望着。月英是明白他那話因的，依然是不便插嘴説話。張介夫見他桌上有現成的香烟火柴，就吸上了一根，噴岀兩陣濃烟之後，這才笑道：你那意思，我已經知道，其實你們已是當面談過一次的，就是明説，也没有什麽關係。説着，他眯了眼睛，向賈多才和月英都看了一下。賈多才也來抽一根烟，微笑着，月英低了頭去牽牽自己的衣襟。胡氏只有是瞪了大眼看人。介夫笑向胡氏道：大嫂子，大概你還不明白。你原來的意思，不是想把姑娘找一個人家嗎？胡氏道：是呵！説了好幾天，也没有説成。我們是在窮親戚家裏借住，那裏等得了？兩個程老爺好意，也勸我們説，把姑娘給人做二房，是要不得的事，和我們找個事吧。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>太后的態度也和來時截然不同了！伊只是默默地坐着，難得説話，並禁止我們各人，不准探岀頭去望後面看，就是所謂不吉利的縁故；伊自己當然是格外的嚴守着了。就是在車廂裏，伊也很謹慎，决不使伊的臉對着後方。但我不禁暗暗在懷疑，難道伊能約束伊自己的思潮，也一般不再往後去回想奉天的情形嗎？這恐怕是不可能的吧！</p>
<p>奉天現在是怎樣的情形呢？依我回想起來，當然是依舊恢復了太后未去以前的狀况。那些穿戴得十分講究的官員們，少不得紛紛散去，各回本衙，忙着料理每一個人日常的私事；而那些乾隆的，咸豐的，同治的遺物，也仍將繼續的安臥在各個玻璃盒内，給人們封鎖起來，和那陰森幽寂的古宫，同在相當的時期内歸于消滅。太后即使想到它們，也永遠不再能見到的了！</p>
<p>車輪不住的輾動，窗外的景物不住的後退，我們雖不知道此刻已到了那裏，後來又過了那裏；可是待到駛近山海關時，我們却就因遠遠地望見了那高聳着的萬里長城的影子而警覺了！漸漸地，這一列黄色的火車已打那長城的缺口裏駛進關來了。這關上的大門顯然是並不曾關上：我們先前所懷的一重無謂的恐怖，便頓時消釋了，大家不覺就把心上的一塊大石頭放了下來。深信這重關口一過，便不致再回不得京城了。（二五六）</p>

<h3>梅典</h3>
<p>— 芥子</p>
<p>梅花嶼　西湖為東南勝地，名滿天下，湖中古蹟名區，不勝枚舉，在裏外湖之間，一嶼聳立，碧波環繞，緑水縈廻，天然佳境，本名瀛嶼，亦名孤嶼，有曰孤山者，全嶼多梅，寒香稠疊，因名梅花嶼，宋林逋隱於此，植梅畜鶴，以梅為妻，以鶴為子，故世有妻梅子鶴之説。</p>
<p>梅花嶺　為江蘇揚州之名勝，嶺在江都縣廣儲門外，明秀才吴秀任揚州州守時，溶河積土而成，梅樹滿山，孤芳自賞，史可法殉國後，地方人為葬其衣冠於此，以為紀念，今則荒草封墓，梅花零落盡矣。其他以梅嶺著稱者，江西大庾縣之大庾嶺，因嶺上道路，紅白梅夾道，仰視青天，僅露一綫，梅花之盛可知，遂得名，甯都縣東北與新建縣西外，均有梅嶺，惟今已湮没不彰矣。</p>
<p>梅花山　安徽廬江縣東南三十里許，有山巍然，山上四時皆寂，惟届嚴多，處處梅花，因名之，世説云，魏武子行至此，失道，三軍口渴索飲，武下令曰，前有梅林，饒子甘酸，可以解渴，士卒聞之，口皆岀水，諺有望梅止渴一語，即本此。</p>
<p>梅花門　浙江蘭溪縣之大龍山，在入山隘口夾道皆梅樹，每届冬時，紅白花放，交义成門形，為一天然勝境，下臨大梅溪，土人遂名其地，明太祖曾敗元於此，遂陷婺州，立有梅花頌碑，久廢不存。</p>
<p>梅花屋　江蘇徐州之銅山縣北五里外許有九嶷山，俗呼九里山，明時，浙江諸暨才人王元章（名冕），以善畫梅著，晚歳，來隱山中，結茅廬三間於半山，拓地十畝植梅千株，梅繞屋際，自榜其居曰梅花屋，則號梅花屋主。</p>
<p>梅花妝　宋武帝女壽陽公主，人日臥宫簷下，梅花落於額上，成五岀之花，倍增嬌艷，後遂有梅花妝之名，或謂為壽陽妝，今日婦女額上覆髮作前留海，實濫觴於此耳。</p>
<p>梅花落　為漢時横吹曲名，本笛中曲也，按唐大角曲亦有大單於小單於大梅花小梅花之别，今其聲猶春，即梅花三弄耳。</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>近期紗反動最力</p>
<p>紗市大跌之後、繼續反動上漲、近期漲風異常激烈、市塲上有組織多頭公司傳説、故浮户活動抵補、市盤愈硬、午後聞徐某向恒豐廠開進二十支富貴紗有三千包、市塲議論極盛、此項棉紗、如果確實、與標紗市價、大有關係焉、</p>
<p>金雞市塲散空抵補　慓紗前市開盤、近月漲風即起、塲中買者雲集、市上傳説、買方對於標紗、有多頭公司組織、故散空抵補、市盤急騰、同時現紗銷塲、尚屬良好、結果各月均漲一元六·七·角至九角、午後開盤、漲氣仍在、後以塲中發生風説、謂徐某向廠方開進二十支富貴紗三千包、準備交解標準、市勢稍受影響而平定、結果本月未動、遠月漲一·三·四·五·角、查賣岀裕大一千○五十包、大孚一千七百五十包、源大一千包、達記九百包、振大一千四百五十包、合興二千七百五十包、賡豐一千包、恒德一千四百包、均昶八百五十包、買進大豐一千四百包、新昌一千三百包、元一三千六百五十包、長豐三千二百五十包、大昶一千包、潤康一千三百五十包、均昶九百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市積重難振</p>
<p>棉市始漲後疲、滬上存棉日見增厚、廠方因紗市不起、减工停工者迄今未能恢復、對於原料、需要减少、且海外棉價受匯兑放長影響、採算價愈廉、所以棉市顯現疲象、</p>
<p>鄭標漲時抛賣即起　標棉前市開盤、因美棉微漲、印棉續跌、但紗市趨漲、棉市帶昂一步、然上海存棉、均有一百萬担以外、廠方停車、原棉消費减縮、故逢漲時抛賣者較為踴躍、結果各月均漲五分至二角、午後開盤、形勢益緊、一般説者、比高峯時已跌三元、或須回高一元、再起變化、亦未可知、然大勢狀况、尚屬軟化、但至收盤時、又轉下墮、以金價回落、結果跌五分至一角、查賣岀長和一萬四千五百担、大豐二千九百担、合興三千五百担、潤康八千担、益康一千五百担、恒德一千四百担、振大三千二百担、源大三千三百担、穗隆二千一百担、大孚二千一百擔、吉豐二千六百擔、買進大孚二千擔、吉豐三千五百擔、通記一千六百擔、明德一千七百擔、慎昌三千四百擔、長餘一千六百擔、元一二千六百擔、生源二千擔、源興昌五千擔、穗隆二千一百擔、錦昌三千四百擔、信誠一千九百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>北帮白粳又小一二角</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源祗二十餘號、（貨共四千餘石）本街銷塲雖未爽、而客路包胃續有威海衛烟台龍口等帮辦一千餘包、故前平疲市况、今已稍可見定、但無十分起色、計蘇同南港等粳價無甚榮辱、晚稻雖中關貨尚短數分、然較高者稍能站住、餘外杜尖及陰變元等各花色、以去路不廣、尚帶軟象耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船二十餘號、市上各貨去路無幾、雖殺價而做開寥寥、市價白粳早稻價又小一二角、變元及薄稻短一角左右、其餘各貨亦小近角、</p>
<p>洋米續呈疲軟</p>

<p>麵粉交割三萬一千包</p>
<p>昨為二月份麵粉交割之日、計全月履行交割者、計三萬一千包、因月底現貨甚為緊軋、標準提高、一般套利者、不能再套、是以一部交岀、尚有一部分、則為客帮轉輾抽去、故履行交割者、純為回籠貨、聞阜豐之紅藍車計六千包、福新之緑兵船五千包、信大之緑砲台二萬包、又據業中人之意思、因目前現銷甚佳、廠家無貨應市、致標準與現貨、俏疲呈一反背、故廠家為應付此種困難計、三月份開始時、現貨有照標準加三分至五分之説云、</p>
<p>二月份雜糧交割額</p>
<p>海外麥價逐步上升</p>
<p>雜糧交割二月份之數量、尚覺熱閙、小麥之實在交割者、計四十七車、因内中有六七車、或因貨品不及格、或因客户自行收回、故减少數車、標準黄豆之交割量、計七十三車、大户收進者、為九號計四十五車、其次為三十五號收二十八車、豆餅共計七千片、由二十五號交五千片、六號交二千片、收進者計十五號收二千片、十七號收四千片、二十二號收一千片云、</p>

<h3>讀書會與「沙龍」</h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>最近北大教授朱光潛提倡了一種讀書會，這種讀書會的就是聚集許多研究文學的人在一起，擇定一個日期，大家在一處會面，互相讀自己的作品，以收切磋之功。最近曾在朱光潛的私宅開會一次，到會的人如沈從文，李健吾，朱自淸等皆到塲，淸華學生林庚亦到，當塲並讀其近作之詩兩首。這種讀書會雖然規模甚小，然在中國總不能不算是創舉。在法國這種讀書會却是很盛的，他們管這呌文藝客廳，（Salons　Literaires），普通都譯作「沙龍」。在這客廳裏聚會的文人很多，有詩人，有小説家，有戲劇家，大家互相的讀着作品。所以在文壇上，文人都能聯合起來，互相研究着種種的問題，文壇的空氣，也顯着特别濃厚。如果一個未成名的作家，有什麽傑作的時候，也必須將他的作品携到「沙龍」内去讀一遍，得到大家讚許之後，刋岀來必能一舉而成名。李金髮在人間世第十八期就有一篇「法國文藝客廳」的文章，他説：</p>
<p>「這種風氣是非常有趣，而值得提倡的，當代的作家，可以時常會面，聯絡感情，得切磋琢磨的益處，討論問題，演講，遊藝，甚至於組織政黨，新進的作家也可以有機會認識幾個老前輩，不致埋没天才。可惜我們中國没有這樣好客而有錢的夫人，女士，給我們大家認識的機會，不致再文人相輕，我笑你，你罵我，弄得大家以後不好意思，各築壁壘。—為今之計，至好有一個文藝聚樂部，給各派文人聚會，則以後各報紙屁股必可少打筆墨官司，當一八九五年，巴黎還有三四個比較大的文藝客廳，都是大文豪所留戀的。</p>
<p>原來當時法國文藝主廳的主人，多是一般夫人小姐，這種事我相信在中國是更不會有的。</p>
<p>這種文藝客廳在文壇上的影響是很大的，我們知道一千八百三十年的法國浪漫主義派，戰勝古典主義，「沙龍」的力量却很大，如果没有沙龍，他們便没有一個集合的地方，他們的問題便不能公開的討論，他們的力量也不能集中，文藝客廳這種東西，的確是現在各派文人所應當有的。在曾仲鳴著的「法國文學論集」中，有一節記載法國文人當時在文藝客廳中集會的情形，是非常有意思，所以我現在錄在下面：</p>
<p>「那夜自八時起，浪漫主義派的健將，接踵來到他們的總司令部了，大頭闊面的大仲馬，矮短肥壯的聖佩韋，團圓臉的巴爾札，瘦軀幹的梅希默，衣飾艷麗的米塞，形態嚴肅的維宜，還有二十多個少年，都争先恐後的進來。他們集在紅色的客廳，或坐，或立，或歡談，或狂呼，許峨夫人正在室的中央，大家都向她為禮。有穿紅半臂的，有披長髮的，有御入時的絨衣的，有戴寛濶的黑帽的。少頃許峨就開始誦讀他的新劇了，他的雙目閃閃作光，初念第一齣時，聲音頗微，不分高低，越念越有趣味，至沉痛處，音響劃然，忽變軒昂，如萬馬齊岀，奔赴敵塲，如狂風暴雨，震撼巖谷；末了，他已念畢，餘音嫋嫋，尚纒綿空間，在坐的二三十人，同時鼓掌，聲動屋樑。大仲馬大呌道：「好文章」！德拉克瓦狂喊：「妙哉！妙哉！」那些少年也同時呼道：「奇異的天才！」這一段文字形容法國文人當時在沙龍裏聚會時情形，真是痛快淋漓，令人看了，心中異常的舒服。當時法國的文人能在這種有趣味的地方，互相切磋，自然要在他們的隊伍裏增加很雄厚的力量。</p>
<p>不過在當時法國的文會中，也往往有許多是敷衍面子的，對於一個已成名的作家，有的却不敢正確的批評，比如當一個已成名的作家讀他一篇很平庸的作品，大家也要裝作大為感動的樣子，使他面子上好看些。在夏嘉駐夫人（Mme　Recmtier）的文會中，大家對於夏多布里痕便是這樣。一日夏嘉美夫人約法國當時的諸文人到她的「沙龍」，去聽夏多布里痕讀他的新著，這時夏多布里痕已漸衰老，所編的悲劇，也平庸無奇，所以列席者都感覺失望，但為尊敬夏多布里痕的生平，大家散後都裝作很受感動的樣子。不想這種虚僞的情形在法國也有。我以為中國如果要有文會的時候，第一應當避免的，就是這種虚僞。中國人最好有禮貌，所以也往往極虚僞。</p>
<p>在文章中一個年青漂亮的文人，也最易和文會中的女文人來戀愛。法國詩人拉馬爾丁便是這樣。他在夏嘉美夫人的文會中，便大岀了風頭，夏嘉美夫人也是約他去聽夏多布里痕的悲劇的。他的容貌淸秀，舉止飄逸，所以進到沙龍備受少年婦女的歡迎及愛慕，大家都忘了夏多布里痕，而都注目於這位美詩人拉馬爾丁了。後來他同女詩人斐吕凱（Detpbine　Gsy）認識了，他們兩人時常到風景很好的地方去遊玩，真是親密極了，但是拉馬爾丁已經是有妻的人了，所以没有能同她結婚。這一段段羅漫司，總不能不説是因為沙龍的介紹而得的吧。大仲馬在他的回憶錄中，有一段記載當時文人的留戀「沙龍」的情形，也頗有趣味。云：</p>
<p>「許峨常常念誦他的新著作，極有精神，羅致耶有時對拉馬爾丁，或許峨説：</p>
<p>「散文已聽得多了，念此二詩吧！」</p>
<p>他們或以手倚椅，或以首靠墻，或閉目而吟詠詩句，大家聽罷，便擊節讚賞，能琴者更鼓琴相和，直至夜半，尚不肯分散。</p>
<p>作這有趣的事，我相信總比無聊的消遣有意思吧！</p>
<h3>無題</h3>
<p>— 林熙</p>
<p>從前我曾打這兒走過，</p>
<p>寂寞的秃山雖也寂寞，</p>
<p>但遠樹還繞炊烟縷縷；</p>
<p>寂寞裏偶有雄鷄高啼。</p>
<p>如今我又打這兒走過，</p>
<p>寂寞的秃山依然寂寞，</p>
<p>但寂寞的已不止秃山，</p>
<p>何處見炊烟何處鷄啼？</p>
<p>從前我曾打這兒走過，</p>
<p>高粱地裏驚起過雀羣，</p>
<p>茅屋掛着的茅草半新，</p>
<p>疇隴旁時見牛屎泡泡。</p>
<p>如今我又打這兒走過，</p>
<p>不見高粱地不見雀羣，</p>
<p>没有屋但有茅草叢叢，</p>
<p>而疇隴我也尋不着了。</p>
<h3>故都寒宵</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>破了格兒的，今年的故都没有往年一樣嚴寒，到嚮午馬路上的冰會溶化，雖然到夜晚還有點冷勁兒，不過在趕古曆年關的跑街們會拿掉氈帽，讓腦袋的熱氣發散，嘴裏嚷：</p>
<p>「真煖和哪，不像是過年呢。」</p>
<p>是的，在街上，可以看見一些年景。</p>
<p>十字路口站着帶盒子砲的緑衣武士們，是維持治安的吧，不管這是「廢曆年」，然而警隊們也只好來盡一下責。</p>
<p>平日買賣淸淡的大餑餑舖門前搭起了玻璃喜棚，没油的板糕，墊着豆腐皮的蜂糕，嵌着棗子的玉米麵糕……大盤大盤的擱着，在吸引人們的視綫。待你才一低首瞧瞧的時候，伺在邊上的夥計便會歡欣地告訴你價錢，北平店舖就有這副能耐，用笑臉抓住顧客。</p>
<p>麵食舖前蓋着蘆簾的小桌上排滿着山似的白饅頭，圓的或是高的，頂上點着小紅點，這是過年饅頭的象徵。小夥計一個個把它們從蒸籠中取岀時，上面還冒着白汽。平日只知道北平人過年吃餃子，却不知還有這麽多饅頭在等着傾銷。</p>
<p>紅紅的紙燈籠掛在竹桿上岀賣，另外再陪襯着幾盞畫着紙人紙馬的走馬燈或方燈，全是那麽拙陋，但孩子們是不嫌不精工的，只消查看一下紙有窟隆没有和能插小紅腦燭便帶笑了。花砲店前的砌成行列的老砲也誘惑住了一對對的小眼睛，先得問問怎麽撕開紙拈兒，放起來烟花能竄多高。貪頑的孩子們是甯可把買糖吃的銅子省下來而換取一串小黄鞭的。</p>
<p>賣紅紙黑字春聯的又在每半的老地方停下來，自會有一些婆婆奶奶們熟悉地摸了上去。</p>
<p>「這張是：四季平安；這張是：抬頭見喜。……」</p>
<p>聽着售者的指示，用手掏着兜兒，交易成功了。一些中年以上的女人們是最愛討吉利不過的。</p>
<p>鐵器店把香爐蠟釺擺在門前。</p>
<p>小販們的擔子是那麽豐滿，使人疑惑他可會有賣乾净的一天。雜拌兒的挑子是多的，孩子們買時還求情：</p>
<p>「多放點海棠果！」</p>
<p>「我不要酸杏乾！要花生糖！」</p>
<p>切糕的推車上邊顯得那麽沉重，比平時的特别細巧，面上敷着白果，棗子，一些不敢上大餑餑舖問訊的便來照顧這兒。</p>
<p>水果桃子上特别墊了新的白紙，把漂亮而肥大的果子放在每堆的尖頂上。手裏揮動着鷄毛帚子：</p>
<p>「一毛錢一堆，果子是又漂亮又大啦！」</p>
<p>他們的買賣是很零碎的，因為成筐論蒲包的早有水果局攬去了。</p>
<p>冰糖葫蘆的擔子旁穿梭着人，從支着躱灰塵的布蓬底下的架子取下了一串串的山楂，海棠，葡萄，看那一串糖多，那一串果子大。</p>
<p>汽車電車都似乎增加了輛數與趙數，人們是忙碌的。洋車上，乘客脚旁堆滿了南果包和酒瓶。</p>
<p>要賬的一個個騎着自行車飛奔，肩上掛着白帆布口袋，如果走在幽暗的小胡同裏，這該是多麽饞人的魚餌呢？幸好這種還没有多少「剥猪玀」的。</p>
<p>在這千張萬張笑臉之外，也有着多少擠不岀一絲笑顔的人們呢。</p>
<p>他們用搓拳嘆息來詛咒這寒宵。</p>
<p>没法辦的漢子們徬徨在街角巷頭，盼着到了人靜的深夜，摸回家去，他們躱着那掛布口袋的要賬人。</p>
<h3>歷史小品脞談（八）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>這完全是心理的描寫，比柳永更細膩得多了。這個例子，我用來作渲染法的説明：我們從歷史上找到一個題材，要設身處地替古人着想，要和他一起周歷那悲歡離合的塲合；於是從某個焦點岀發，把整個故事調整過，渲染成一篇新的創作。從前法國寫實主義大匠佛倍爾（Flauberl）以十年長期寫那本著名的薩朗坡，（Salommbo）是這樣從瓦窑中燒岀來的；我想：一篇成功的歷史小品亦必得如此燒煉岀來的罷。</p>
<p>魯迅先生於民國十五年間，在厦門寫過幾個故事新編；在自選集中選存了「奔月」，「鑄劍」兩篇。我現在拿「奔月」來結束這個嚕囌的談話。「奔月」是以「嫦娥奔月」那個傳説作底子的，魯迅先生將這傳説現實化了。嫦娥是不滿足於現實生活圈子向美麗的幻想境中飛去了的；而碰在現實碑上的勇士——后翠，他只能吃吃「烏鴉的炸醬麵」，喝喝「碎爛了的麻雀湯」，對着結婚以前射得的文豹皮嘆氣；而那射封豕的强弓只能用以射隻老母鷄，讓老婦人去嘲笑；這是面着現實世界在扮鬼臉。其末叚，寫：</p>
<p>「羿懶懶地將射日弓靠在堂門上，走進房裏去。使女們也一齊跟着他。</p>
<p>「唉，」羿坐下，嘆一口氣，「那麽，你們的太太就永遠一個人快樂了。她竟忍心撇了我獨自飛昇？莫非看得我老起來了？但她上月還説：並不算老，若以老人自居，是思想的墮落。」</p>
<p>「這一定不是的。」女乙説，「有人説老爺還是一個戰士。」</p>
<p>「有時看去簡直好像藝術家。」女辛説。</p>
<p>「放屁————不過烏老鴉的炸醬麵確也不好吃，難怪她忍不住……。」</p>
<p>「那豹皮褥子脱毛的地方，我去剪一點靠牆的脚上的皮來補一補罷，怪不好看的，」女辛就往房裏走。</p>
<p>「且慢，」羿説着，想了一想，「那倒不忙。我實在餓極了，還是趕快去做一盤辣子雞，烙五斤餅來，給我吃了好睡覺。明天再去找那道士要一服仙藥，吃了追上去罷……」</p>
<p>我讀了，如北風裏淋了一頭冷水，渾身都在打戰呢！假使有人愛讀歷史小品的話，我先推薦這一篇。（完）</p>
<h3>嚮晚（十）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>「呵！哈哈！」胡一元二手抓起松白色綢褲子，拍呀拍的拍起腿來了。帶有刺的眼光，儘向大肚子臉上射。「是屬於娘子軍的呀！娘子軍——你知道嗎？」</p>
<p>「娘子軍。」步行半個全國，然而不曾找到半個娘子軍的李安可愕然了。</p>
<p>「是呀！你算我是娘子軍底師長，可是你呢！」大肚子立刻轉向胡一元那面來。「你少不了也是個旅長了吧！」</p>
<p>「可是我到現在還祗幹上半百零一個呢。」</p>
<p>「但我也不至有幾千吧。你——你，再説，年紀還輕呢。要是活到像我那樣年紀，你準有軍長——軍長資格了咯！」</p>
<p>胡一元立時變青了臉。「活到像他樣年紀，這是一句什麽話？這簡直是枚針，直穿入自己心裏。他現在四十六歳了，自己還祗二十四，還差二十二年。唉，别説這二十二個年頭没法打發，便是眼前，眼前——</p>
<p>「那我祗有再發幾次彩票横財！才辦得到哪。」胡一元揮着手，踱了起來。「像我爸爸那樣的，爸爸。……」</p>
<p>記起了爸爸，胡一元底臉又由青變白。爸爸便是在軍閥時代發行塘工劵，慈善劵之類起家的。直到他死時，大英租界，法蘭西租界，日本租界，全有舖子，大大小小不下十來家。自己身邊不帶錢，可跑遍這里全個地面。那條街上人，不認識自己，那家酒館，不認自己賬。就是一所同鄉會學校裏，爸爸也捐岀三萬元基金，而現在——</p>
<p>「他媽的。好事做不得。」胡一元又突兀地隨着自己想頭説岀來。「爸爸做的功德，到兒子時代，連一個掛名的校董都没份了！——我——我要問問你們，」説着在二把沙發椅前面站下來，「你們學校裏情形怎麽樣了？」</p>

<p>電信為國有事業，非私人所得經營，其理由：（一）私人以牟利為目的，此争彼奪，擇其有利者圖之，於是電信不得普遍發展；（二）消息之傳遞，首重秘密，若由私人辦理，關係重大且影響各方利益之電信，難保其不致露；（三）電信所以便利民衆，惟屬國有，相互挹注，乃能收費較廉，人民之負擔較輕，而各地定價，在統一主權下，亦得一致。</p>
<p>基斯原則，故電信之在各國，多歸國家辦理，間亦有組織公司者，亦必受政府之監督。若未經邀准，私自通電，是為私設。私設妨及電信主權，損害國營事業，按諸刑法，及電信條例，均必科以應得之罪。</p>
<p>我國境内之私設電台，自民國以來，發見不少，大都寄設於租界之内。較小者作兩地間金融及商業上之通報，其甚者兼收商報以牟利，影響所及，流弊滋多。天津永立永增合兩銀號，在日本租界私設電臺一案，偵查破獲後，訴諸法律，經法院判决號主范進功等連續結夥竊盗，各處徒刑三年，並賠償交部損失，此舉殊足懲一儆百。</p>
<p>或曰：「電波非物，不能謂為竊盗；而私收電波，對於交部電臺，亦無損失。」夫電波為傳遞電信用之一種能力，藉能力之發射，對方乃得收受以成電碼。能力放自國有電臺者，祗國有電臺，乃可收受，反之即為私收，非其所有而取之，是為竊盗，即不諳法律者，亦知之諗，烏能以狡辯掩其罪？若謂私收電波，電臺並無損失，則國家法令，以及電信條例，等於弁髦。凡屬私人，均可放膽設臺，收受無綫電信。國營電信事業，將見破壞無餘，而交部因受私設電臺之影響，歷年營業上所受損失，亦可謂為應得，世甯有此理耶？</p>
<h3>解决「時間問題」</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>西諺云：「時者金也。」凡科學家—無論經濟學家或物理學家莫不注意時間問題的重要性。良以時間為效率之母，效率為生産之源，苟工作時間無法計算，或計算而不凖確，則效率無從説起，生産何由發達？換言之，忽略時間問題，謂之反科學精神可也。</p>
<p>交通部為增進電政效率起見，訂定全國電政機關時刻校對辦法，按照中央天文研究所之規定，分全國為五大時區如左：</p>
<p>（甲）以東徑一百二十度之時刻為標準者曰中原區。蘇，浙，皖，鄂，湘，贑，閩，粵，魯，晋，豫，冀，熱，察，遼等十五省，及黑龍江之龍江，嫩江，璦琿，漠河以西呼倫等屬之。</p>
<p>（乙）以東徑一百零五度之時刻為標準者曰隴蜀區。綏，甘，甯，陝，川，黔，桂，滇等八省，及蒙古暨青海之西甯，與西康之德格以東等處屬之。</p>
<p>（丙）以東徑九十度之時刻為標準者曰回藏區。新疆，西藏，蒙古，及西康之昌都以西，並青海之西部，暨甘肅之安西以西等處屬之。</p>
<p>（丁）以東徑八十二度半之時刻為標準者曰昆侖區。新疆之綏定，伊甯，疏附等處及西藏之西部屬之。</p>
<p>（戊）以東徑一百二十七度半之時刻為標準者曰長白區。吉林及黑龍江之大賚，林甸，奇克特以東等處屬之。</p>
<p>上項時區之時差，以中原區為標準。（中原區與英國格林維區標準時刻相差八小時，即格林維區十二時，中原區為二十時。）如中原區為十二時，則隴蜀區為十一時，回藏區十時，昆侖區九時三十分，長白區十二時三十分。每日由南京局用有綫電，及上海局用無綫電於上午九時，將中原區時刻，分别通知，全國各局台。各局台依次按照時差校對時刻。此項辦法，自今日起實行，從此全國時間，均有一定標準矣。</p>
<p>此項辦法之復點有二，（一）屬於通信方面者，便於稽核報務時刻。縁電報通信，原貴迅速，商業情報，尤為注重。歐美電報，以分秒計算，偶有差誤，關係匪輕。我國各地電局時鐘，多照地方時刻校對，漫無標準，故電底上有收報時刻，早過發報時刻者。有發報時刻，遲至數小時收到者。偶經查詢，彼此均稱無誤，蓋各地時間不同，難於稽核。今對校辦法實行後，一掃前日之弊矣。</p>
<p>（二）屬於社會方面者，促進遵守時間習慣。社會人士，多不注意時間的重要性。試觀每一集會，常不按時到會，種種散漫性質，充沛無秩序無組織的表現。良以人各有時，無法一致。欲革除此弊，非注意時間的真確性不可。今由交通部規定校對時刻辦法，社會人士，如欲確知此時為何時，請向當地電報局，無綫電台式電話局詢問，當必據實答復。久之，全國時間，均有定規，俟時而動，决無延誤。對於促進新生活運動上，大有裨益也。</p>
<h3>論新聞電報欠費</h3>
<p>— 仲華</p>
<p>吾國電報事業，以歷年官軍電報費之鉅額積欠，經濟基礎，幾瀕於危。所幸近數年來，經電政當局之積極整頓，前項積欠，已逐漸减少，此後政治安定，更不難導入正軌，全數收費。顧在此整頓欠費聲中，尚有為一般人所未加注意而又為電政經濟上鉅額之損失者，則新聞電報欠費是也。</p>
<p>查新聞電報本與尋常電同一性質，照章須先行付現，始可拍發。但電局顧念新聞記者岀發各地，採訪新聞，未便隨帶鉅欵，按電付現，故訂有收報人付費辦法，以資便利。此項辦法，原訂定收報新聞機關，必須在收報電局預存足敷半月報費之存欵，方准拍發。是對於拖欠報費，已有預防，似不致再有積欠之虞。但考之事實，首都某大通信社積欠報費即已達三十餘萬元之鉅。其餘積欠萬餘以至百餘元者亦多。他如北平，漢口，長沙等處新聞機關欠費，為數亦屬不少，是則新聞電報欠費，已有官軍電欠費之嚴重程度，不容吾人等閒視之也。</p>
<p>新聞電報欠費之原因，就記者所知，約有下列數端：（一）國内新聞機關，除少數著名報館及通信社外，大都經濟不甚充足，電局向其收費時，每用種種方法推諉延宕，以致所欠報費，愈積愈多。（二）各電局歷來對於官軍報付費，新聞報費向抱放任政策，祗顧本局收支可以相抵，即不願多事催收，以增煩瑣。（三）電局負責人員，對於新聞電報章程，不加注意，不予照章預收存欵或發電超過存欵而不催續繳存欵，或催繳不到而未予停止送報及通知發報局拒收電報，以致任其電報源源而來，一旦奉令催收，則欠費已多，發生困難，有此三因，新聞電報欠費，遂成今日之嚴重狀態矣。</p>
<p>按電局為輔助文化事業，對於新聞電報，定價特廉，照現行章程，祗及尋常電報價四分之一。即國内新聞電華文每字二分五厘，洋文每字五分。此項低廉報價，尚不足抵電局工料之值。聞電政當局對於新聞電報欠費，將切實加以整頓，以免多所損失，深望新聞界，共體時艱，勿再有故意拖欠情事，是則記者所切盼者也。</p>
<h3>幣制與電政</h3>
<p>— 中明</p>
<p>吾國幣制，因歷來各省自由鼓鑄，省自為政之故，以致成色减低，不足法定標準，所以非常混亂。甲乙丙地之間，不但幣價不能一律，甚至易地就不通用，民衆因此所受痛苦與損失甚大，而各種國營事業也莫不大受影響。近閲報載：財政當局現正注意到此項問題，將逐漸整理改革，以期全國整齊劃一。過去曾聘請美國幣制專家甘末爾氏妥為設計，最近復延攬國内各專家從事研究，並廣徵各方意見，詳加討論。結果將由財部飭令造幣廠鼓鑄五厘，一分，五分，一角，二角，五角，等數種硬幣，即銀行發行輔幣劵，亦照此項制度規定，不得異於法定數目。以後便用此種法定輔幣，行使市面，將現在市面上流行之銀銅紙各種雜幣逐漸收回，並在事前先將各處散播着之劣幣加以適當的整理與淘汰。刻正照此擬具方案，以便呈請行院轉呈中政會核議，再交立法院通過，然後規劃實施。</p>
<p>上述問題，初閲之，似與電政無關，但仔細一想，則電信界因幣制混亂所受之損失，着實不少。最普遍者就是電報報費找零困難，因為輔幣價值不固定，時常變動，必須將銀錢行市隨時掛牌公告。同時因為法定的「厘」「分」「角」各種輔幣，尚未正式發行，找進岀數目，難期凖確，因此發報人或電報局之間，總不免要受些損失。現在有幾處電報局為使雙方均無損失起見，大都用郵票找零，但郵票一經着汚，便難使用，所以此項辦法，未能為每個發電報人所歡迎，根本的救濟方法，仍是在於迅速鼓鑄法定的標準輔幣。</p>
<p>其次如珠江流域所流行之毫洋，四川省區内通行之川洋，均因成色不足，價值低落。前者用時須打折扣，不能十足行使，且早晚之間，幣價不同，電報局計算報費，發生許多困難。後者在川省境内雖可十足行使，但省外匯兑，貼水有時高至百分之四十以上。而各項電信材料機械，均須以十足大洋購辦，故川省境内電報營業收入，無異打個六折。再如滇省紙幣充斥，價值跌至票面一折以下，電信機關為免除損失計，對於此項紙幣，只能照市折扣收受，因之民衆無力發電，電信營業遂一蹶不振。他如北方各縣，因輔幣缺乏，各商店任意濫發輔幣劵，流弊所及，不堪勝言！往往發行此種輔幣劵商號早已倒閉，甚至並無店號假名僞造者，電報局遇到此種雜色紙輔幣，當然慎重收受，因此生岀許多無謂的糾紛。近聞已經各地政府嚴厲取締，但因法定輔幣仍然缺乏，一時無法救濟也。</p>
<p>從上述各點觀之，足證電信界對於幣制之統一與整理，其有同情。希望財政當局努力進行，早觀厥成是已。</p>
<h3>倫敦實習記</h3>
<p>— 郭茂桐</p>
<p>余等於廿三年十月十五日抵倫敦。第二日，即往標準電氣公司接洽實習課程，並託其代覓住屋。初到的幾天，先由該公司導往Sonthgate及Woolwick工廠參觀，藉知該公司内部工作的大概情形。正式實習，隨即於十月廿二開始。其實習課程，與國内所擬者，大致相同。</p>
<p>標準電氣公司的工廠，原分設三處：一部設在Hendon，一部在Southgate，一部在Woolwick。現Hendon工廠，房屋合同期滿，被英政府收回，已於半年前分别遷併在Southgate及Woolwick處。Southgate廠内分四部：</p>
<p>（一）無綫電機製造部：收發報機之製造屬之。該部對於無綫電機之製造，均有專家日夜研究，聞最近發明一種五○五驚吵機，備船隻及海岸電臺用。凡船隻發救急呼號，其波長在六百米突左右時，此機即受感應，發驚吵信號，報員一聞此聲，即可另用一機從事搜尋，無須日夜看守。我國國内電臺，附設之海岸臺，其報務不忙者，如能裝用此機，無須派報員終日守值，可由其他機器報員兼管，人工方面，可减省不少。又該廠新岀一架M15發報機，係晶石振盪。天綫輸岀電力為二千華脱。波長為十五米突，至一百二十米突。全機之電力供給，完全用整流管，其强力放大真空管仍採用氣冷方法，不必如用水冷方法時之裝置抽水筒等設備，故裝置亦屬簡單，頗合我國内電臺之用。現國内電臺電力最高者，不過五百華脱，而此五百華脱機之天綫輸岀電力，實際不及二百華脱，故不能勝任過重之工作，一遇綫路發生障碍，即感受困難，此非偶然者也。</p>
<p>（二）電話機件製造部—以自動電話機件為多。</p>
<p>（三）木工廠—各機件之木架均在此製造。</p>
<p>（四）總辦公廳—全廠共有工人三千餘人，女工居多，每星期工作四十七小時。廠中備有醫院，及公共飯堂，均公家設備。每餐取費較之外處約便宜一半，故職員及工人，大都在此午餐。Woolwick廠分三部：</p>
<p>（一）電纜製造部—其原料銅綫係購自外處，並非該廠自製。</p>
<p>（二）燈泡製造部—收發報機之燈泡屬之。</p>
<p>（三）成音週波機件部—如無綫電話用之Jermina　Equipment，及有綫電用之Vokce　Frequency　Telepraph，均在此部製造。其中陳有一架最新式之Voice　Frequency　Telegraph，用此機件，能在二根銅綫上，同時拍發十八份電報，將來我國有綫電綫路上，大可採用也，該廠工人約二千餘人，其中女工亦不少。</p>
<p>我們在倫敦住了旅館十幾天，方始覓到比較便宜的住處。旅館既貴，且招待亦不好。我們原想住在Soutbgate附近，因為在那邊有四個月的實習，不過房子很難尋，結果是住在倫敦中心區，每天要坐四十五分鐘的地道車到廠。倫敦的地道車，論設備座位，固較之巴黎為佳，但是價目却較法貴；依距離的遠近而定票價。還有路綫的方向，亦没有法國淸楚，初到的人，頗感困難。</p>
<p>倫敦的郵電，亦是合設的，國内電報價目，非常便宜。殖民地不在内，每份電報僅收費一先令（約合滬洋七角）以十二字為限。每加一字，加一便士。另有夜信電一種，每份亦收費一先令，但字數以三十六字為限。每加一字至三字，增收一便士。</p>
<p>這次由滬至英共行了三十五日，因意大利船走的比較快一點，故船上路程祗有二十四日。在歐洲大陸因此耽擱了十日。要是走其他的郵船，船上就要耽擱三十幾天，沿路所走的地方，雖是很多，但停留時間甚短，故見聞有限，尤以電政方面，不能有比較精密的調查，即錄諸於筆者，亦大都得諸於傳聞，錯誤在所難免，是則不得不在本文之末，特别向讀者，申明者也。</p>
<h3>改訂國内電報計算抄費份數方法</h3>
<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>吾人有時為某項事故，要同時發電給兩個住在同一地方之親友，不必將電文相同之電報，分作兩張拍發，可以按照電報收發辦法，發寄分送電報。此項分送電報，除加抄費外，祗收電費一份，省費不少。按照國内電報向章抄費係將原電除外，每加抄一份，收取一份抄費。換言之即分送兩份之電報，祗次收取一份抄費。但按照現行國際電信公約附屬電報規則第六十一條第三節第四項：「抄費係按每份所含字數分别計算。所抄份數，等於收報人姓名住址之數」之規定，國際分送電報抄費份數，應照電報内所含收報人姓名住址之數目計算。例如列有兩個收報人姓名住址之分送電報，其抄費應照二份核收，因此與現行國内國際分送電報抄費份數計算方法，各有不同。一般發報人，不免要發生誤會。交通部有鍳於此，特通令全國各地電報局及無綫電台，飭自本年三月一日起，無論國内或國際分送電報，其應收抄費之份數，概照電報内所含收報人姓名住址之數目計算，以歸一律。兹試述其理由如次：</p>
<p>查分送電報投送之時，每份祗須抄錄一人之姓名住址，其餘收報人姓名住址及納費標識均不列入。如須將所有收報人姓名住址完全列入者，應由發報人另加Gta字樣納費標識，收報局台方可照辦。例如下列分送電報「TM2上海武定路六十三弄十四號張伯虞II馬霍路（Io79）號王毓英II事妥詳情俟返滬面談炯」拍到上海電報局後，投送之時應由該局分抄為兩電如下：其一「上海武定路六十三弄十四號張伯虞II事妥詳情俟返滬面談炯」，其二「上海馬霍路（Io79）號王毓英II事妥詳情俟返滬面談炯」，並將每份電報端應列之計算字數和實在事數分别計改正。按照上述規定辦法，發報人拍發一張分送兩個收報人之電報。收報台局收下之後，必須重行分抄兩份，並須將每份電報之字數分别核計改正。既然經過抄兩份手續，所以該電抄費應照兩份核收，理由極為正當。盤恩國際電報公會對於國際分送電報抄費份數之計算方法要照這樣規定，其理由當亦不外乎此。此項改訂辦法，自今日起實行，深恐各界不明真相，故為之説明耳。</p>
<h3>世界電信發明家小傳（續一）</h3>
<p>— 健</p>
<p>六，約翰威廉史脱特雷賴夫（John　Willian　Strutt,Radleigh）</p>
<p>雷賴夫氏為英國之物理學家。一八四二年生於愛塞克斯之蘭福特格林地方。嘗肄業於劍橋之神學院。一八七九年繼麥克斯威爾（Cterk-Maxwel）任卡文狄許學院之實騐物理學教授，在職五年。一八八七年任皇家學院自然哲學教授，一九○五年被選為皇家學會之主席。至一九○八年雷氏復膺劍橋大學之聘，任該大學校長之職，一九一九年卒。氏係十九世紀最著名實騐物理學家之一。氏非僅精擅數學分析，并善以試騐證明其理論。其試騐均用自製之器具作之。雷氏在物理學上之各部咸放一新曙光，自氣體論以至波形論及電磁説，皆其例也。氏恃其縝密之試騐工作，最先發現空氣中氛之存在，實為發現空氣中多數惰氣之嚆矢。他如測量絶對電流用之雷氏平衡機，亦甚著稱。</p>
<p>七，愛德華勃蘭萊（Edward　Branly）</p>
<p>勃蘭萊氏為法國無綫電專家。生於一八四四年法之亞敏司城（Amiens）。幼遊學巴黎，旋入巴黎大學肄業，繼獲物理學及醫學博士等學位。勃氏從事電磁波之研究其久，一八九○年及一八九一年復以無綫電電波使長距離間局部繼電器之電路動作。一九○○年因發明無綫電傳導體（Radio-conductors）由國際超然學術公律審查委員會（International　Jury　of　Superior　PreceptInstruction）授給大奬章。一八九○年氏發表研究鬆弛黏合之金屬導電性之結果，并測得在某距離間之電花，具有驟然改變粉狀導電體電導性之力。所謂黏屑檢波器者，亦為氏所發明。</p>
<p>八，湯姆斯愛廸生（Thomsa　Alva　Edison）</p>
<p>愛廸生氏生於一八四七年。為一實騐應用電學之大發明家。初從事於新聞事業，旋棄而研究電報學，於雙工制發明尤多。一八七一年至紐約，其技藝漸為人所稱道，翌年雙工電報試騐成功，又二年而四工電報成功；繼即於西方聯合電報公司製造大批岀品。一八七六年愛氏復棄其製造廠而築試騐室於紐約之門羅公園；於是致力研究電光者數年。一八八一年至巴黎展覧竹絲燈泡試騐亦告成功。一八七八年復發明留聲機。一八八二年監造紐約第一所電燈廠。旋將其試騐室遷至紐約之奧倫奇地方，以建築試騐及發明電氣之大發電所，經苦心研究，卒發明製造品四百種之多。愛氏發明物中尚有發電機一種，顯音器一種，化學電表，電筆一種，謄寫器，磁石分礦器，測電計，電氣魚雷，傳話機一種，及蓄電池一種。而其所以博得世人稱譽者，尤以改進電報及發明燈泡及留聲機為最。</p>
<p>九，亞力山大格雷享倍爾（Alexander　Graham　Bell,）</p>
<p>倍爾氏為蘇格蘭之科學家。生於一八四七年埃丁堡城。氏於中學及大學畢業後，得醫學博士學位。一八七○年至加拿大，越二年任波斯頓大學聲帶生理學教授。一八七六年氏以其發明之傳音器公於世，而電話始藉以蜕化創製焉。又以一種電氣發明物試騐與聾者交談。其法乃向一精薄之金屬片發話以振動之，并將電流傳至電綫之他端，使此片之振動，藉一磁石之動作，傳遞至另一金屬片，以發生重複之結果。倍氏試騐結果，斷定不僅能傳遞原來金屬片之振動，且可使次一金屬片，發生重複之聲浪。一八七八年倍氏發明光綫傳聲器—有聲電影—利用光綫之變化，以傳送聲音，繼創製留聲機。氏於科學論文著作甚多，一九○二年獲皇家學會亞爾倍奬章（Albert　Medal），一九一八又獲該會之赫斯奬章（Hughes　Meeld）。卒於一九二二年。</p>
<h3>半月消息</h3>
<p>保護電報電話桿綫　交部以各省電報電話桿綫經過之處，大都係鄉村僻野，行人稀少以是時有宵小竊盗電綫木桿，影響報話通信，妨礙政治軍事，關係甚鉅。爰經　訂保護國有電報電話桿綫規則，呈請行政院召集内政軍政交通三部，並邀司法行政部會同審查修正。現經行政院第一九七次會議議决通過，並通令各行政機關遵照。兹將該項規則擇要摘誌於下：</p>
<p>（一）國有電報電話桿綫及其附屬品，應由桿綫經過地方之行政機關負責督率所屬警團廵查保護，如發覺竊盗或毁損桿綫時，應嚴密緝辦，並通知電報局或電話局查勘修復。</p>
<p>（二）一個月内轄境發生竊盗桿綫三起以上，而不能緝獲者，該地方行政機關主管人員，應照公務員懲戒法，交付懲戒。如迅速破獲者，得由主管機關列入考成，予以奬勵。</p>
<p>（三）竊盗桿綫人犯，搬運寄藏或收買贓物者，及毁損桿綫者，一經緝獲，均送司法機關從嚴懲辦。如有知風報告，因而人贓並獲者，交部當酌給奬金。</p>
<p>訂定檢查電報辦法　交部以各地商民發寄國内國外密電，例須檢查，兹為避免商民誤會起見，特訂定交通部檢查電報辦法，其要旨為凡本國人民拍發密電，如發報人係殷實商號，應於電底上加蓋商號戳章，並由經理簽字保證，可免逐電檢查，惟遇必要時，仍須將密本交岀檢查。普通人民拍發密電，應將密碼所代字句，另紙錄岀，連同電本，送交局台檢查。至密電之内容，局台當絶對保守秘密。凡外國僑民拍發密電，應先由駐在地之領事具函聲明，或在電底上加蓋領事館之戳章保證，可免逐電檢查。惟遇必要時，仍須將密本交岀檢查。如當地無該國領事，則應將密碼所代字句，另紙錄岀，連同密本，送交局台檢查。再國内外發來之密電，遇必要時，亦應由收報人將密本交岀檢查後，始行投送。局台檢查時，當迅速辦理，務使電報免受稽延云。</p>
<p>國際電報法郎折合率更改　國際電報價目係以金法郎為單位，我國電局收費時，向按預先規定之法郎折合銀元率，折合銀元價目計算。此項折合率現時每法郎合國幣一元，兹因金價跌落，自三月一日起，改為國幣九角五分。例如前往歐洲尋常電報每字價目原為三元四角五分，自三月一日起每字祗收費三元三角云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談上海的學堂</h3>
<p>— 望樓</p>
<p>在上海，真是無奇不有，就如開學堂吧，説來好像近乎荒唐，但事實却是勝於雄辯，我們對上海的學堂且不要去從事調查，祗要在路上略略注意，學校招牌之多，也就够呌人吃驚了，但希奇的還不在數量的浩多，却是在學校地址的揀擇上。上海弄堂裏開學堂，大家早經知道，巴不為奇。可是烟紙店的樓上開學堂，亭子間裏開學堂，後門上釘招牌等等，到現在還没有一個地方的學校會跟他相比抗，所以還依然保有其新聞價值，成為上海開學堂史上的特色。</p>
<p>隨着年來上海居民數的激增，學堂的需要自然也祗日見其加多，為適應這些需要，學堂自然就如雨後春筍般的連二接三的産生了，有眼光的企業家，看到這個情形，自然刻不容緩地不放過一個良好機會，可是没有資本的窮朋友也都你拚我凑的弄一筆整數來試一下。不過『學堂是人人會開，各有巧妙不同。』有的就先造校舍，有的就先拉學生，有的用宣傳主義，有的標岀『介紹職業』的實在利益，有的校董吃硬，有的是設備齊全，有的説學費可免，有的講牌子最老，衆説紛紛，各盡招徠之能事，但可憐我們這些想追求一點真實學問的孩子們，就在這種情形之下頭昏眼暗了。</p>
<p>記得有一個學堂的廣告上，曾經標上校内一列用的是抽水馬桶，聽説，就這麽一來，便得着了許多學子的好感。根據了這個，我相信在不久的將來，學堂裏快要有着東方唯一的冷氣設備了。</p>
<p>其次，我們再把上海學堂的性質作一番檢討。</p>
<p>上海學堂的性質，説來却又頗費唇舌。我們這裏把一般性質的學校撇開不提，但説一點比較特殊的，那麽『女子教授英語』的學堂就有着好幾十家，其餘如無綫電自然就有着無綫電學校，修理或駕駛汽車，就有着汽車學校，拉提琴有提琴學校，學打字就有打字學校，跳舞便有着跳舞學校……概括一句話，祗要上海有這麽一種技能的存在，就有這麽的一樣的學堂的岀現。所以上海的學校數固是驚人的，學校的種類與性質也是同樣够人煩心呢。</p>
<h3>蓮花燈時節</h3>
<p>— 縱心</p>
<p>和已淪没了的東北遥對着的西南，僻處邊陲，那兒隱藏着佳麗秀絶的大理，好像全給人們忘記了的大理呵！我老遠是懷念着你那澄淸秀雅的姿色。懷念着蒼山雪，洱海月；尤是秋天的洱海月。想到了秋天，就不禁令人愛追憶起蓮花燈時節的洱海上那難忘的，洱海上的蓮花燈時節！</p>
<p>靠着没有化雪的時候的蒼山，却能終年温暖如春的臨望着洱海過日子的大理的人們，似乎還較安閒的過着自然的生活，做着閒逸的美夢。年年到了四月下旬，正是春老時，洱海上飄着傍晚的初夏的凉風。全大理的村村家家，羣集着無數的紅男緑女，三日趕南，四日趕北的繞拜三靈，過着為青年男女們所最歡欣的繞三靈節。夏夜的凉風，從洱海灘盪起，飄得最快人的時候，代表最普遍的農家樂的火把節，是在六月二十五那天晚上陶醉着。秋風起了，洱海月美化得更迷人的時分，七月二十三日，最熱閙的撩屍會，又在全大理的懷抱内，歌舞着快樂的音曲。就在這夜裏，洱海上閙放蓮花燈，多麽迷人的時節呵！旅人一顆疲倦了的心，怎不依依的泛起追戀的情懷？</p>
<p>洱海上的春天，春水盈美，極是可人，但五洱裏的夏天，却也更碧緑如天鏡，站在海灘呆望，會生了棄塵的念頭，追下洱海去，甘願沉落碧波裏呢！像美人的秋水的碧波喲！</p>
<p>泛舟浮玉洱，就在這蓮花燈時節最為熱閙適宜。這一天呌撩屍會節，洱海邊的臨水亭，集聚着許多念經者，在念經吊鬼。洱海上的龍舟，採菱船，幾乎充塞了海洱。碧波之上，輕盪馳飄，奔放超逸的神態，使舟上的人們，越飄越醉。</p>
<p>這也便是大理，民間的，偷看未婚夫妻的日子啦；少男少女，給别人代訂定了婚姻，要先看看那人如何，便只有在這例俗内，各泛舟海上，隔船相覷。所以萬舟瓢泛，羞澀私湧的傳情波，是比着洱海水，盪得更是「滿池春水」呵！這一天，誰也要上洱海一趟呢？</p>
<p>舟上的弦管歌樂，應着碧波漾盪。歌曲傳情，少年人們。這一天是歡樂得發狂了。洱海，全沉在歡狂的跳躍中。</p>
<p>盡情的飄了一天，醉迷晚歸，大理的人們的趣樂，還没有消散。夜風輕飄，快爽得這蒼山洱海懷抱的人們，心花更加怒放。於是，幽靜迷離的海夜，頓閃閃着萬盞的蓮花燈了。洱海好像給火繞着了，那美麗如星光的火點呵。洱海，換了新鮮的，更美妙醉人的衣棠：洱海在跳躍起舞了！</p>
<p>海灘上，站滿了遊人，放燈的，看燈的，大理的人們，大半跑到洱海邊來夜遊。蓮花燈，給輕盪的海水飄着，燈光閃動，一朶朶的，活像海上的蓮花。蓮花燈光，又照映得海水上跳躍着無限的金波。海灘，海灘上的人們，也給燈光閃得臉孔嬉亮，醉人的夜色。笑聲，歌聲，幽美的輕喚聲，海灘上，響着一片悦耳的夜曲！大理，這時節，真像天國之夜呢，人們是這樣歡樂？</p>
<p>蓮花燈時節，你歡樂的美夢呵！</p>
<h3>離散</h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>過了今天，我又要與家與一切的親生信人分别了，本來在自己久已習慣放浪生涯的情感上，人間世每當别離的種種悲傷和酸楚原就於我無有，因為我往往以為人好像一路没定向的風，在空中四處吹，吹到什麽地方便是什麽地方，都没有怎樣的牽連。可是此刻不知怎的，心底倒有點感到没着落的惆悵起來。</p>
<p>這次能够回家小住一些時日，算是種不易逢的意外的歡幸——如果不是為了自己沈重的心臟病想休養一下，無論如何是不至會那麽輕飄地回來的。而重新温味着只許在夢中温味的家園的聚樂。可是為着不願意使别人無端替自己增加一重憂懷自己便早决心把病信隱藏過</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>去，不露聲兒讓任何人知道，當第一天踏進門，娘於異常驚喜之後，隔半嚮，端詳到自己蒼白孱瘦的面容時候，於日陰鬱着臉殷切的問着：</p>
<p>—琪兒，你為什麽淸瘦得這樣，是不是身體不適。</p>
<p>心眼兒很精細的娘凖有幾分猜岀來了，但是我不忍在一種久别乍見的娘於驟然的喜悦之間復驟然的担負一份愁慮，我盡力按捺住脆弱的心靈的跳動，用着十分堅强的口氣回答：</p>
<p>—娘，没有的，總是旅途勞頓吧了。</p>
<p>那麽一説，娘也就不疑心信為真實的了。</p>
<p>這以後我又陷在不可告人的痛苦中，娘是知道自己這番回來只能作短促的逗遛的，因此所有的親人以及娘更加珍惜這短促的團聚的時日，而招呼我彷彿有如招呼一個尊貴的客賓那麽仔細體貼。在這樣過分的熱烈的愛撫的情感之下，我的精神反而覺着不舒服，因為一方面我還要極端謹慎着自己的起居言動，處處做到不露岀絲微的病的狀態來，處處得裝成没有病的健康人一樣嘻笑着跟弟妹調趣，以至於晚間合着娘長談，説着離家的中間許多事給娘聽，壓制着一切不能多於勞動的病症的苦楚，於是身體上載着一層枷鐐之外，心靈上又加上一層枷鐐了。</p>
<p>但我想，從我日常間繁密的接觸偶爾不留神表顯岀來的不同的舉措，娘多少還是疑慮着不放心。</p>
<p>——琪兒，我看你一定身子有點不好過，你説吧。</p>
<p>——不，我覺得很好。我仍然否認着。</p>
<p>——我總不信你的話，你回來已十幾天了，怎麽老是面色蒼白，越來越瘦了下去，琪兒，既然回到家裏，有什麽不好過，也該趕緊調養，在家一切都方便，不比在外的。</p>
<p>——娘，真是没有，我騙你做甚，我想，也許住不慣鄉村的生活哩。</p>
<p>夜間，待娘理完了好些雜務以後，時時是悄悄地來到我的房子裏，坐到床沿上，一壁輕輕地摸撫着我的手腕，一壁以着柔婉的温和的聲調反復地盤問着，在那青色的黯淡的瓦斯燈光下。娘的一面沈肅的臉龐，在那人間全部母性的照射下，有時幾乎使我感動得快要吊下淚來。</p>
<p>但我到底不曾吐岀埋在深心底處的心事。</p>
<p>日子駛得滿快，容許一個月的居住已經過去了。幸虧我的隱秘没給誰覺察岀來，我可以用力支持更沈重的身子跑岀去，而没教娘知道以致愁憂無止，却使我愉快，今天，是留住的最後一天，明天我即將抱着一個病身回來也仍然抱着一個病身辭家。</p>
<p>晚上，娘又用着包無限含的慰撫惋惜的口吻問我：</p>
<p>——琪兒，再住幾天也没關係吧，為什麽這樣怱怱來怱怱去呢，你想你没回來已好幾年了啊！</p>
<p>為着生活的鞭撻，使我無從應允娘的美意。明天只好在不願分離中走了。祗是娘啊！你永遠惦念着的兒子連他自己也不敢説這别離是短期的不見面，還是最後的永恒的分手？</p>
<p>那麽一縷微烟似的悲哀此時纒繞着我的思念。</p>
<h3>黄昏游真如</h3>
<p>— 李三郎</p>
<p>慘切的天空吊着粉緑的雨，宇宙裏顯得那麽凄迷的。大都會的上海底街頭，也跟着無情的雨而消沉下去，那麽冷靜地，除了一些不能不地在街頭上迎着雨水的飄擊的人們放着匆急的脚步，除了那老虎也似的車輛在路中怒吼地向着迷濛裏進行，便深深地顯現岀冬天的凄凉的景象來。</p>
<p>為了一點小事務，也是為了我天性</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>愛好在凄凉的烟雨重圍裏探求，於是决定在這樣的一個傍晚的時分裏向着我不大熟識的真如去，似乎要在這樣的短急的雨天裏旅行得到一點滿意的眼福，也可以説是要享受雨天裏郊野的詩意的風緻。下午四點鐘的時分，我跟了一個小朋友從北站坐了那很壞的公共汽車向着真如去。</p>
<p>公共汽車的慢行速度從平坦的士敏土的馬路上轉到閘北區那凹凸不平的小石塊的馬路上，那時冬天的冷風帶了郊野的氣息漸漸兒的從玻璃窗的空隙間透進來，掠過了我那曾給雨水濕潤了的臉孔，我的心胸似乎感到一點寒凉來，那沉重的雪衣加上了雨水質量，更給我感到一種莫名的不舒服來。那慢行的汽車帶着我們從繁華的市區轉到一條小冲濱同時又是火車路的旁邊的交通路上，漸漸兒不見店户，只是瞧見那非常迷糊的天色底下的一些菜圃或田塲，那麽死了一般的沉默，河邊長着的荒草，像孤獨的旅人似的在給無情的風飄蕩。那時已完全地離開市區，我們已在不平坦的鄉道上慢慢兒的給汽車抛動。有時可以從給雨水濛着的玻璃窗瞧見雨的黄昏的郊野的微動。那疏若孤星的行人或一些同樣殘舊的公共汽車放岀來隆隆的聲音，有時，火車路上有一個殘兇的老虎似的火車頭帶着幾個車廂隆隆地奔駛過去，然而郊野的黄昏，除了這些以外，什麽都找不岀來了。</p>
<p>到了真如，我們進了國立暨南大學裏去，那時已快要天黑的時候了，尤其是那凄迷的絲雨和灰黑色的天幕把大地上的一切都罩籠得緊緊的，更給人感到這時分的冷靜，那繁雜的大學裏也給雨水所侵襲，除了一些學生們穿着雨衣在不平坦的用小石塊砌成的路上穿來穿去以外，學校裏再没有一點的景象了。——那十九世紀式的半新半舊的校舍，在雨霧中展開得那麽遥遠的。我們兩個在小徑上慢慢兒的跑着的時候，總感到這兒是很陌生的。尤其是一些人們都把陌生的眼珠子撳着我們的時候，在這樣冷靜的黄昏而我們却這樣的踽行着，我們從學校裏跑了一週以外，便趁着天色還未黑透以前在真如市塲的小街道上跑了一回，那十八世紀式樣的小市鎮已給凄凉的雨所迷濛得没什麽好景了。於是，我們又從老遠的小河繞得鐵路歸到學校前邊，在廣東居吃了一頓夜飯——那兒真熱閙呢！全是廣東學生擠滿了，充滿了笑話的囂張，我們吃過了飯，岀門來的時候已是黑沉的，尤其是那狂暴的雨水滴滴地沙沙地侵襲着我的身上，皮鞋也給泥濘和雨水濕透了。</p>
<p>好容易，等到汽車來到的時候，我們又跳上車廂讓牠在黑夜的鄉村帶到市區裏來，那時，車廂裏再看不見外面的景物，只是黑沉的東西一團團地在眼眶掠裏過吧了。　　—二月廿一日。</p>
<h3>古直主張讀經救國</h3>
<p>— 丙</p>
<p>自胡適在港演説，反對廣州讀經後，頗若起各地大學教授的注意，燕大教授許地山，在北平發表談話，對中大文學系教授的讀經，有不滿之詞，該系主任古直，昨致校長鄒魯，反對許的談話，頗有脹脈憤興之感，此事關係甚鉅，贊成和反對的兩方，各有各的主張，兩不相下，我這裏並不是參加任何一方和反對任何一方，也並不是把兩者加以深刻地批判，不過我對於讀經的個人意見，略為解説解説。</p>
<p>現在的世界，完全是飛機大砲的世界，讀經之不足以救國，固無待論，即使因世風不古，人欲横流，而欲以讀經來作狂瀾的砥柱，恐怕也有鞭長莫及的趨勢，古人所謂衣食足而知榮辱，倉廩實而知禮節，現在在這樣經濟潮流，大大地不景氣之下，而欲使人從容論道，黌舍談經，此種别有天地的風趣，原是令人景仰不置的，奈何其太不時髦乎。衛人迎新婦，婦上車，問驂馬誰馬也，御曰借之，車至門，扶教送母，滅竈，曰將失火，入室見臼，曰徙之牖下，妨往來者，主人笑之，此三言者，皆要言也，然而不免於笑者，早晚之失時也。</p>
<p>不過既經是大學，而又為文學系，則經書原有一讀的價值，因為既稱文學系，自應以研究文學為對象，無論外國文學，中國文學，多應研究，即古代文學，和現代文學，也應研究，因為不研究非但不能深知其中的好處，亦並不能深知其中的壞處，惟研究方能洞知其中的奧妙，能比較得岀其中優劣也。</p>
<p>現在有一部份人，固執偏見，若一聽見讀經，便要頭昏腦脹，便視同蛇蝎，深惡痛詆。這也大可不必。並不是書中自有顔如玉，書中自有黄金屋，因為他們研究的對象，是文學。既經文學，經書自應有研究的必要，倘不讀經，文學怎樣可以研究呢？是否我國的文學絶對没有文學的意義呢？還是研究文學只能研究新的而不能研究舊的，只能研究外國文學而不能研究中國文學呢？這種見解，恐也不免有些矯枉過正吧。</p>
<p>因此我贊成讀經，原有相當的條件，並不是一味贊成讀經，至於中小學校，而並不專門研究文學的，本來可以不讀，也並不是讀了有多大的害處，因經書是不需要，過晦塞，並且也没有多大時間去研究，這些還是揀應用，而明白曉暢的文字去讀讀，較為得益。</p>

<h3>形形色色的明星們背誦對白的方法（上）</h3>
<p>— 蜜薺</p>
<p>如果你突然間做了一個電影明星，或是一個要開口説話的演員，你將用什麽法子來記熟你應當背誦的對白？這不是一個很有趣的問題嗎？現在我且告訴你些，好萊塢一般電影明星，怎樣背誦對白的方法，或者可以給你一些參考的資料。</p>
<p>第一次你背誦對白的時候，你或者會像一個小學生似的，先對着一本書，口誦心維的默默牢記着。但是不久，你就會得到了一種特别帮助你記憶的方法。這樣，你在不知不覺之中，就養成了一個特别古怪的脾氣。古怪的脾氣，是不一而足的。你或者喜歡坐着，你或者喜歡站著，或者喜歡走著那多算不了特别。但是照耐特施巴克斯所説的—他立誓那不是假話—他認識一個舞台名伶，那個名伶在每一次新戲排演的時候，他就一個人在夜半，手裏拿著一個電筒，跑到郊外墳塲裏，用電筒照著脚本背誦對白。這不是太奇怪了嗎，但是有許多電影明星所用的方法，亦有和以上所述的差不多有趣的。</p>
<p>劉亞理斯背誦對白的方法，是將對白譜成曲子唱着，才容易記住。所以他在新片子的對白發下來之後，他就坐就鋼琴前面，一頭彈，一頭唱，直到他背熱了為止。</p>
<p>威廉斐爾斯常常手執脚本，在他的橘園裏徜徉着。他一壁走，一壁背誦脚本，或重新翻閲着，將鳥和蜜蜂當作他的觀衆，時常試用著他奇怪的音調，問著自己這樣好不好？</p>
<p>保羅蒙尼是一位最刻苦用功的演員了。他練習對白的時後，他一定先要將他説的話，收進了收音機，然後再將那片子摇着，聽取上面的回音。他聽了再收，收了再聽，直到他認為滿意之後為止。據演員們説，這是頂好的法子，他可以聽見自己的口音正確與否，聲音的高低輕重如何。卡爾勃立生，他因自己是丹麥人，也是用這個方法，來糾正他的口音的。</p>
<p>琴妮麥唐娜記憶對白的方法，是將她的對白，親手抄寫若干次。她常常將自己鎖在書房裏，抄寫到幾個鐘頭，直等到爛熟流利為止。愛麗絲懷德也是採取這個方法的。她每天晚上臨睡之前，就抄寫明天用的對白多少次。明天一早起身之後，再自己默寫。她的記憶力普通是很强的，所以她到了明天早晨默寫的時候，總是一字不錯的。</p>
<p>在這裏，我可以順便聲明一句。每一個演員在每天下午離開攝影塲之前，他一定已經知道了明天拍的是那幾個幕序。所以他們亦祗要記熟那幾個幕序中的對白就够了，並不像舞台演員，一定要一下子背熟全劇的對白。當一個明星或演員接到了脚本之後，他就通篇讀了一下，了解了劇情的大致，和他自己所演角色的身份。他無庸先將全篇的對白背誦起來，不然他會勞而無功的，因為那裏面的詞句，往往要依了導演的意思，臨時變動增减的。</p>
<p>島格拉斯蒙高梅有一個特别的脾氣。他到背誦新對白的時候，就坐了自己的汽車，叫車夫開到郊外曠野無人之地，然後開足了馬力往前去。車越開得快，他的對白越容易記住。理查亞倫的脾氣，却和島格拉斯蒙高梅正相反。他先在家裏誦讀對白。等到讀熟了。就自己開了汽車岀去玩，旁邊坐著他的夫人，或他的秘書，由他的夫人或秘書將對白讀着，他就高聲地跟着，直到一部音調姿態完善了為止。還有一個潘弟派德森，亦是一定要坐在汽車裏温習對白的。她的侍女；就權充了她的提句子的人。</p>
<p>倘使你跑到雷門諾伐羅的花園裏，看見他揮著手，高聲談著話，你一定以為他是和朋友談話哩。但是他祗一個人，並没有什麽朋友。他走着路，演習着，作着各種形狀，如同他已經到了鏡頭前面一樣。瓊克勞馥和雷門諾伐羅差不多是個相反。她常常在攝影塲上，一個人喃喃自語着。她不喜歡像雷門的頭先表演。但是據許多人説，瓊的默誦的方法，都是最靠得住的方法。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「蓬島春光」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Legong——大光明</p>
<p>我們對於這一影片感覺相當的興趣，那便是其中大部份介紹了南洋巴利島的人物風光。在這裏有着那一島國的風土人情，在這二十世紀的三十年代，還保持中世紀的土風。女人們從事操作貿易，而男人們却是鬥鷄嬉遊。那邊有着可愛的和平，人們在嫵媚的風景之中，平和的生活着。那邊所有的是質樸，善良，和東方的，靜穆的，特有的民族性，都充分的由於銀幕上介紹岀來。明媚的陽光，澄淸的流水，多末可愛的自然影物啊！當我們在慘酷的現實中感覺極端痛苦的時候，幾乎以為那是人間仙境，而使我們飄然有着逃世之感。</p>
<p>但是事實上，我們不曾忘懷巴利島是荷蘭的殖民地，那些半開化的土人，在白種人的政治，經濟，以及文化的侵略之下，是如何的過着奴隸一般的生活，我們是可以想像岀來的。據説，荷蘭政府對於土人的法律，比較英國還更為殘酷，因而奴隸們被虐待的慘遇，自然是不言而喻。然而這一影片却完全漠視這些地方，在這裏我們看不到荷蘭國的對於殖民地統治的痕迹。這些應當作為被描寫之主要題材的，完全不與作品接觸，相反的只誇大那地方半開化的生活，習慣，以及男女間的戀愛。</p>
<p>自然，一般電影藝術家對於某一民族最感覺興趣的，便是男女戀愛，但是離開政治經濟之機構來單獨的描寫，决不會得着正確的輪廓。因而使我們聯想起取材於北極的「愛斯基摩。」在「愛斯基摩」中，劇作者没有忽視作為文明人的白種人，對於未開化的土人是如何壓廹與欺凌，那一種非人待遇的深刻而且真實的描寫，給與我們極深的印象，同時其電影藝術的真價也就在此，雖然也只能有一個人道主義的傷感的Endingo「愛斯基摩」的劇作者，對於那地方的戀愛，也感覺極大的興趣，作為主要的題財而採取，但是那裏所有的愛的悲劇，却是由於政治的聯繫，電影藝術的成功了的。可是「蓬島春光」却並不如此，祗是戀歌的畫面化，除了……Should　Love　enter　Thine　Eyes　and　go　to　thy　heart　beware……抒情詩的描畫之外，我們是看不到其他更重要的東西的了。那末作者之粉飾太平之用心，乃是至為明顯的了</p>
<p>在這裏僅有的是愛的悲劇，可是由於土人演員演技的生疏，以及劇作者或導演也没有好好的處理與安排，因此悲劇的情感，没有適當的表現岀來。不過看慣了有聲對白的美國影片的人們，對於這一默片配音的「蓬島春光」（其中有一段歌舞塲面是有聲的，）自然可以換換口味，何况因為五彩的原故，對於色調的欣賞，更可以使觀衆們能有某種程度之滿足的了</p>
<h3>評「楊柳春風」</h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>The　Gay　Divorcee—大上海映</p>
<p>在强調着一二主角的歌舞，與利用着廉價地批來多數肉感的舞女，作為大型的活動背景這類的歌舞片中，要求有較完整的劇情，這原是難以如願的空想。</p>
<p>這兒，「春風楊柳」和别的這類影片，没有多少不同地以一個所謂歌唱跳舞家何頓者上塲，在輪埠偶然的機會中見一少女美美，就好逑地終日在市井中奔波着，希望得遇伊人而戀愛之。後來居然男女相悦，發生了所謂愛的糾紛，拉長着歌舞的塲面，搬運着活動背景，一下子低靜了下去時，再來個熱舞甜吻作結。</p>
<p>「楊柳春風」因為是由舞臺劇改編的關係吧，在如上的歌舞片公式中，總算是多少還有點戲的成份存在着。開始時美美因衣裾被鎖在姑媽的行李箱内拉破了，不得不披了你頓的雨衣回去。作者用這個來使男女主角發生干係，展開戲來，雖不免有點笑話，但中間如在旅館中佈置一個假戀愛局面，讓美美的丈夫看了好同意離婚，而偏巧何頓也闖了進來，大演其真的愛劇，以及那位為丈夫者親眼看了妻子與人要好，却偏偏不在乎，這些倒是頗戲劇的。在激將不成，假局失去效力，大家反而弄殭之時，來一句侍者的話，無意地揭穿那位丈夫的秘密，讓劇情急轉直下，也是「柳暗花明又一村」的戲劇的手法。這兒劇作者也無心地譏諷了現行婚姻制度之可笑的實質與底面。至於這位歌舞家和至友大律師在酒館中因穿衣時忘了皮篋，付不岀錢，逼得當衆跳舞到昏倒過去，以抵欠賬這一穿插，也幽默地説明了如此紳士們在現下是演着怎樣的角色。</p>
<p>編劇者除能利用舞台劇的優點外，尚没有和别的那些改編劇本而被原作限制，或拘泥，以致妨害了電影藝術的特性之弊。那一句習語來作暗號這點，雖不很够電影的手法，可是在戲的展開與效果上，却是很有帮助的。</p>
<p>導演Mark　Sandrich的處理尚稱明快，寫何頓在各地獵尋美美一段複寫的鏡頭與織接甚好。幾個大舞蹈塲面的處理却未能免俗地浪費着，没有做到過人的地方。五支歌曲的唱岀也未能溶融於戲劇的必要中，為歌而唱，為舞而跳，這原是一般歌舞片的總缺點。倒是把那位老於情塲的姑媽寫得頗好，用她為姪女的事去托律師時對他的那股勁兒，伏下後來她居然取得了他的印象，可謂簡而實深。</p>
<p>演技以女角琴逑羅吉絲的美美較好，不見愛於丈夫，而羞怯與熱愛别個男人的少婦情態，演來頗細膩週到。男角茀雷亞司坦的何頓，那副流氓相，嬉皮笑臉雖博得不少觀衆的笑，可是因此也不免减低了由他口裏所唱岀的歌的効力了。</p>

<p>電影小説</p>
<h3>學童慈母（Grand　Old　Girl）（五）</h3>
<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>露蘭貝爾斯接連擲了三次，都是七點。戴德嘴裏喊着：「接連三個七」！心裏不覺詫異起來。他立即抓起了那兩顆骰子，仔細騐着。他看了半天，忽然眼火冒中岀光來，睁開了一對大眼，正想發作的時候，密司貝爾斯已經先開口了。她説：「克拉倫斯，那兩顆骨頭不至於有什麽毛病吧？那是你自己的東西啊」。她説了，自己覺得這事有些滑稽。趁着戴德張着隻大嘴，嚈了一口吐沫，説不岀話來的時候，她就將桌子上的鈔票，拾了起來，塞進了她的大布口袋，微笑着走了岀去。她臨走還説道：「謝謝你，克拉倫斯。你到底還是個正直的賭徒。我也可以放心了」。</p>
<p>不久，戴德地方旁邊，空房子前面的「召租」招牌，已經揭了下來，換上了一塊新招牌，上面寫着「前房」兩個字，却與戴德的「後房」針鋒相對。在克立克戴德「後房」贏來的錢，却都用在露蘭貝爾斯的「前房」的裝修陳設上，將它弄得煥然一新，準備和他那「後房」一較雌雄。在「前房」裏，那兒有温暖的地毯，顔色的窗帘，舒適的沙發和靠背椅，咖啡座，和一盤一盤的食物。學生們組織的音樂隊，供給了跳舞的音樂。地毯在屋子的一端，捲了起來，是光滑的跳舞地板。</p>
<p>密司貝爾斯站在那裏，四週張望着，不覺笑逐顔開起來。或者，最後她已博得勝利了……但凡事不可自滿得過早。不過，她聽着那些小孩子，擠滿了屋子嬉嬉哈哈的談論着，一個説：「為什麽再要上戴德那兒去呢？他那兒喝一杯麥芽冰淇淋，這裏可以喝兩杯，一樣的東西」。一個説道：「哼！通那魚，生菜三民治，六分錢一塊，還有真正的梅雲尼蛋漿，那兒買呀」？尼泊通，穿着一身侍者的衣服，腰上圍着白裙，嘴巴嬉開了，直到兩邊的耳朶旁十二分内行的端著食盤，行走如飛地奔忙着，嘴裏高聲喊着：「三個雙料巧可立麥芽冰淇淋……兩個波蘿蜜聖代……一個生菜三民治加酸黄瓜……」櫃檯裏面噭聲答應着：「馬上就到！」她看着，聽着，怎能使她不高興呢！她走到櫃檯口，問着那裏面的侍者道：「一切都順當嗎」？那侍者笑道：「再順當没有了！不過巧可立冰淇淋快完了」。密司貝爾斯道：「桑狄馬上就來，我已經打電話給他了」。</p>
<p>她説着就走了開來，心裏盼望着桑狄，因桑狄又想到了吉琍傑賴。桑狄亦是她的學生之一。他現在開着送冰淇淋的送貨車，但是他極有人品，並且極有志向，他决不永遠開送貨車的人。桑狄是亞芳臺爾地方青年之中，惟一的不受吉莉傑賴的支配和誘惑的。他從來没有進過戴德的門。他天天將冰淇淋送到戴德的門口，就掉首而去。</p>
<p>他從來没有到過戴德的「後房」，直等到露蘭貝爾斯自己突然侵入那個地方的時候。那時吉莉和許多小孩子，正在和戴德呼么喝六。他們看見露蘭貝爾斯突然走了進來，都覺得老羞成怒，大家要和她為難。桑狄却在這個當兒突然岀現了。吉莉是學生的頭腦，她譏諷着貝爾斯。桑狄於是挺身而岀，對着吉莉道：「你這種孩子所需要的就是一頓好好的生活，並且我頗有意思，我自己來給你那頓生活」他説着就保護着密斯貝爾斯岀來了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi Fly to Hankou</h3>
<p>Visiting Chairman Jiang the Same Evening</p>
<p>Discussing Matters of the Economic and Financial Committees</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Welcomes Song and Kong</p>
<p>[Hankou] Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi, upon receiving a telegram from Jiang, came to Hankou from Nanjing on the 28th via a Ford plane, arriving at Wangjiadun Airfield at 3 PM. Accompanying them were Li Yuwan, a consultant of the Ministry of Finance, and secretaries Chen Fengyi and Chen Kangqi. Song and Kong stayed at the Guohuo Bank. That evening, they visited Jiang. Kong stated that Jiang, Song, and Yu were all standing committee members of the National Economic Council and had come to Hankou to exchange opinions. They also discussed the new budget for the 24th year with Jiang and the funding for bandit suppression in Sichuan Province. Regarding the reorganization of Sichuan's finances, Liu Xiang had discussed a plan while in Nanjing, and the central government's subsidy of 2.4 million was being allocated in installments: 1 million in the first installment, 800,000 in the second, and 600,000 in the third. Song would return to Nanjing in a few days and then go to Sichuan at a later date. Yu had no immediate need to go to Sichuan and would return to Nanjing soon after a short stay. Kong concluded by saying that the issues of financial relief and silver required comprehensive planning, as the Chinese people only knew how to hoard silver and rarely circulated it. To prevent outflow, customs barriers should be built based on the fluctuations of banknote prices. The prohibition of prize-linked savings was also discussed. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Jiang received Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi on the evening of the 28th to discuss important matters of finance and the Economic Committee. Zhang Xueliang also crossed the river to visit and hosted a banquet to welcome Kong and Song. Kong and Song were scheduled to meet with leaders of the banking community in Hankou and heads of national tax agencies to give instructions. They were expected to stay in Hankou for three to five days before returning to Nanjing. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen flew to Hankou on a Ford plane at 3:30 PM on the 28th and stayed at the Guohuo Bank. Zhang Xueliang, Qian Dajun, and others visited for conversation. At 5 PM, Kong and Song visited Chairman Jiang. According to Kong, his and Mr. Song's visit to Hankou was to report to Chairman Jiang on the total calculation of the national income and expenditure and the financial problems of Sichuan Province, and to exchange views on the work of the National Economic Council. They would return to Nanjing together after completing their business in a few days. The guiding principles for the reorganization of Sichuan's finances had been largely decided after several discussions with Chairman Liu in Nanjing. Subsequently, Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, and Chen Shaogui, Special Commissioner of Finance for Sichuan, conducted a detailed study and formulated implementation steps, based on the principle of unified collection and expenditure, and divided the financial powers between the central and local governments. However, due to the initial stage of reorganization and the tense military situation of bandit suppression, there were concerns about insufficient funds. Therefore, the central government specially subsidized 2.4 million yuan, 1 million in the first month, 800,000 in the second month, and 600,000 in the third month. A branch of the Central Bank would be established in Chongqing to stabilize the province's finances. To prevent large amounts of silver from being exported, the government implemented balanced tariffs last year, which had been quite effective since its implementation, and the market price of silver had gradually stabilized. Now, in order to stabilize public sentiment and relieve market panic, the government specially purchased silver from London in order to activate finances. As for the prohibition of prize-linked savings, which is related to the interests of the people, the government is currently considering it deeply. Regarding the auction of Shenxin Factory No. 7, the Ministry of Finance is also seeking relief measures. The Economic Committee has established an office in Chongqing, and Standing Committee Member Song's inspection tour to Sichuan would likely take place about a month later. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Kong Xiangxi said before leaving that Song's trip to Hubei was at his invitation to discuss general financial issues and that they were scheduled to return to Nanjing on the same plane. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi flew to Hankou on a Ford plane at 12:30 PM on the 28th. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Two Ministries Discuss Remedial Measures for the Shenxin Factory No. 7 Incident</h3>
<p>The Beijing Chamber of Commerce Asks for Relief</p>
<p>Tang Youren Issues a Statement</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the HSBC auction of Shenxin Factory No. 7, Minister Chen Gongbo was dispatched to Shanghai to investigate. On the morning of the 28th, Chen sent a long telegram to the Executive Yuan, reporting in detail on the recent situation and the talks between Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and Mr. Hemmick, manager of HSBC Bank. The Executive Yuan replied to Chen in the afternoon, instructing him to inquire further about the relevant points. It was heard that the government's current attitude was to focus on preserving the foundation of this emerging industry. However, due to loan relations, the Shanghai Municipal Government was still responsible for negotiating repayment methods with the banking community and dealing with HSBC Bank. Liu Yinpu, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Industry, reported Chen Gongbo's telegram and the Ministry's relief measures for the factory to Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, this morning. In the afternoon, he visited Li Tang, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, to exchange initial opinions on remedial measures. As a result, it was decided that the two ministries would prioritize planning and implementation within their respective areas of responsibility and that the two ministries' Shanghai-based agencies should pay attention to developments and report them to their respective ministries for reference. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Judicial Administration telegraphed the Second Court of the Shanghai Special District on the 28th, instructing it to quickly cooperate with the administrative organs to handle the Shenxin Spinning Mill case according to law and to report the handling situation to the Ministry at any time. At the same time, it replied to the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, saying that it would review the situation at any time after receiving a report from the Shanghai court and handle it according to law. Furthermore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is studying various documents such as the nature of the loan contract between the Shenxin Factory and the British HSBC Bank in order to prepare a basis for negotiations. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] An official from the Ministry of Finance said that the Ministry and the Ministry of Industry are jointly discussing the HSBC auction of Shenxin Factory No. 7. The first step is negotiation, and the second step is economics. Judging from the current situation, negotiation is more important than economics, and the officials and Shanghai Municipality are handling it. However, the economic issues under the jurisdiction of the Ministry are also under discussion. The point that still needs to be studied is how much cash can Shenxin Spinning Mill itself afford to redeem, and how much cash will the government take care of. Also, Liu Yinpu said that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry are discussing detailed measures to remedy the auction of Shenxin Factory, with the content focusing on economic aspects. If the 2 million yuan borrowed by the factory from HSBC is now prepared for redemption, how much can the factory itself afford, and how much should the government raise? A thorough discussion is needed. The focus of the entire handling of this matter is first on investigation. The Ministry has telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to conduct a detailed investigation of the original loan contract between the factory and HSBC, as well as the auction process and the production value of the factory's land, buildings, and machinery, and submit it to the Ministry for research. As for negotiation, the Executive Yuan has instructed the Shanghai Municipality and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to proceed. The Shanghai Municipality has sent Yu Hongjun to visit Mr. Hemmick, and at the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also negotiate with the British Consul-General in Shanghai. The government's handling of relief for the factory will be studied after the investigation has some progress. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Beijing Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Economic Committee, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration on the 28th, saying that the British HSBC Bank's unauthorized auction of Shenxin Factory No. 7 was an illegal and tyrannical act that was ineffective in stopping it. Not only was it heartbreaking for our country's modern industry, but the dignity of the law was also swept away. The Chamber held a meeting yesterday and unanimously agreed that this matter would have a great impact on the future of industry and was related to the national system. It was decided that the illegal auction could not be recognized as valid. However, the method of rescue should be handled by serious government negotiations and by appropriating funds for assistance, in order to maintain industry and restore sovereignty. Therefore, a special telegram was sent to ask for consideration and swift maintenance. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Tang Youren issued a statement on the Shenxin Spinning Mill issue on the 28th, as follows: "Since Shenxin Factory No. 7 suffered from capital exhaustion and could not operate last year, the government invited banker Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, and Mr. Rong Zongjing's younger brother, the general manager of the factory, to Nanjing to discuss the government's coordination with the banking community to raise funds for assistance. The Cotton Control Association of the National Economic Council sent people to reorganize the factory in order to replace new machinery, adopt scientific management, improve products, and increase production. At that time, negotiations were already underway, but Rong suddenly overturned the previous proposal and refused to implement it, causing the original plan to be shelved. On the morning of February 26, the government suddenly received a telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Cotton Yarn Industry Association stating that HSBC Bank had decided to illegally auction the factory on the 27th due to debt disputes in order to offset the debt. At that time, the Executive Yuan held a routine meeting, and Yuan Director Wang proposed it for discussion. In addition to resolving to hand over the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance to discuss relief measures, he personally drafted a telegram and immediately telegraphed Mayor Wu to meet with the British Consul in Shanghai to find a way to stop it. Unexpectedly, when the telegram arrived, HSBC had already illegally auctioned it at 3:30 PM that afternoon. Although the government has always paid attention to the situation of the factory, the business content is confidential, and the factory has always been tight-lipped about it, so the government has no way to intervene. This matter happened, and the government did not receive any reports from any parties beforehand. When the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed, the deadline for disposal was February 27, but HSBC illegally disposed of it on the afternoon of the 26th. To figure out the truth, it must be very complicated. The government believes that this matter is very important to the future of the yarn industry in our country. In addition to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry personally going to Shanghai to investigate, and Yuan Director Wang telegrammed Mayor Wu again to investigate and report in detail, in order to maintain the domestic industry, it is determined to uphold the original intention of helping the factory in the past and use the power of politics, diplomacy, and economics to find ways to save it."

<h3>Talk Meeting of the Central Political Council</h3>
<p>Agreeing on Several Budget Principles</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After the conclusion of the Central Standing Committee meeting on the morning of the 28th, a talk meeting of the Central Political Council was convened, and all ministers of the various Yuan and Ministries attended. Under Chairman Wang, the basic principles of the budget for the 24th year were discussed. The discussion resulted in the decision to form a Budget Review Committee, with candidates to be designated by the three Standing Committee members, and stipulated that the budget for the 24th year of each agency must be submitted to the meeting before March 10 for review. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After the Central Standing Committee adjourned on the morning of the 28th, the Central Political Council held a policy discussion meeting on the 24th annual budget. In addition to the Central Committee members, heads of various agencies attended the meeting and listened to the financial report on the amount of budget revenue before agreeing on several principles, limiting the agencies to submit an outline of the budget summary before March 9, which would be reviewed and approved by a review committee organized by the Central Government.

<h3>Sui-Mongolian Tax Dispute</h3>
<p>Continued Negotiations in Peiping Approaching Agreement</p>
<p>[Beiping] Regarding the Sui-Mongolian tax dispute, negotiations have continued in Peiping for several days. The two sides' opinions are similar. On the 28th, responsible personnel from Suiyuan and Mongolia in Peiping stated that in this time of national crisis, there should be no disputes on the border and that the tax issue should be resolved fairly. The point of contention is that the Mongolian side demands that Wang Jingguo's troops be withdrawn from Bailingmiao, northwest of Uhei Asukhei, and Shatu, so that the Mongolian government can set up checkpoints in the Uyi two leagues to collect taxes. The Peiping authorities will handle it according to the seventh provision of the Inner Mongolia Autonomy Principle, allocating a portion of tax revenue from the province and county to the Mongolian government for construction purposes. It is impossible for the Mongolian side to set up checkpoints on the border to collect taxes. How to resolve it is still difficult to predict. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Bao Yueqing visited He on the morning of the 28th, and Wang Wei received him on He's behalf. Bao said regarding the Mongolian-Suiyuan tax dispute that De Wang sent a telegram hoping for a fair resolution, and Wang agreed to convey it. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Implementation Procedures for the Change of Defense of the War Zone Security Team</h3>

<p>[Tianjin] Recently, Japanese and Korean vagrants have been relying on their barbarity to board various trains on the Beining Railway without buying tickets, especially on the Luan-Yu section. Ticket inspectors are immediately confronted when they inquire. Yin Tong and Yi Wo have agreed that from the 28th, each passenger train will have two Japanese military police officers from the Shanhaiguan Japanese Military Police Detachment accompanying the train to cooperate with the inspection, limited to the Luan-Yu section. Most of the Japanese and Korean vagrants east of Tangshan who take the Beining Railway do not buy tickets, and those who do buy tickets do not go to the destination station. For example, from Yuguan to Tangshan, they only buy tickets for the Yuguan-Luan County section and force the pseudo-national banknotes to be valued at full price. Yin Tong telegraphed Yi Wo, hoping to inform the garrison commander to crack down. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Xi'an] According to a telegram from Nanzheng on the 26th, since Xu Xiangqian's bandits were repeatedly suppressed by our forces, there are currently no traces of bandits on the north bank of the Han River. The bandits west of Baocheng have been fatigued by days of fighting and oppressed by our large army. Most of them have also retreated to the area around Maoba Ji. The bandits used their main force to attack westward from the upper reaches of the two rivers, and our encircling and suppressing troops gave them a head-on blow, causing about 2,000 casualties. After the remnant bandits collapsed, they attacked westward from the Baishui River in an attempt to break through, but suffered heavy losses again. The bandits on the south bank of the Han River were also severely attacked by our army in the Lengshui River area and collapsed to Moujiaba Huangguanling. The bandits are now like turtles in a jar.

<p>[Xi'an] Yang Hucheng, Director of the Shaanxi-Suiyuan Appeasement Headquarters, returned to the province from inspecting defenses in southern Shaanxi earlier this month. Due to physical fatigue, his old illness relapsed, and he rested in the province. Recently, he received an order from Chairman Jiang to serve as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the three routes of the Bandit Suppression Army on the 23rd and concurrently as the Commander of the First Column. When reporters visited Yang on the 27th, he said that his illness had gradually recovered after medical treatment. After receiving the order to serve in the Bandit Suppression Army, he would go to southern Shaanxi after his illness improved slightly. Currently, the situation of bandit suppression in Shaanxi Province can be divided into two parts, in addition to the bandits in northern Shaanxi, which are being suppressed by the local army. One is the pseudo-25th Army of Cheng Zihua and Xu Haidong, which fled from Henan to Shaanxi and has been defeated by our army. Only a few hundred people are left, and they are currently fleeing in the Tianmen Mountains on the border of Hubei and Shaanxi. They have lost their ability to fight and are not harmful. They will be annihilated by the encirclement and suppression of the Shaanxi army and Xiao Zhichu's troops. The other is Xu Xiangqian's bandits, who fled from northern Sichuan to southern Shaanxi. During this northern invasion, our army repeatedly gave them heavy blows, and their fierce momentum was thwarted. They have now collapsed and retreated, and our army has been pursuing them for days, killing many bandits. According to recent reports, the remnant bandits have fled to the Phoenix Mountain area. Our army is currently approaching from all sides and intensifying the encirclement and suppression. The frontline bandit suppression military affairs have been implemented in accordance with the Chairman's telegram order, and a concrete plan has been drafted and is being actively promoted. I will go to the front to command after my illness improves slightly. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Central European Treaty and German-Austrian Relations</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Since last year, the most troubled area in Europe has been Central Europe. The German National Socialist Party's coveting of Austrian politics has repeatedly caused incidents, and the tense relations between Italy, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Hungary have almost led to war. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to call this region a powder keg of Europe. Furthermore, looking back at the common phenomenon in Central European disputes last year, it is that whether it was Germany's actions towards Austria or Italy and Hungary's actions towards the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, there were signs of aiding political factions of other countries to create a climate of terror within the territories of other countries in order to reap benefits. However, Austria was able to quell internal difficulties repeatedly because of Italy's assistance. And the relations between Italy, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Hungary were also eased through France's mediation. However, the foundation for peace in Central Europe is actually built upon the recent understanding reached in Rome. And its concrete manifestation is the Central European Treaty currently being discussed by all parties. Although the content of this treaty is still not fully known, according to the European dispatches received so far, it essentially contains two major points: (1) non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and (2) mutual guarantee of peace. Observing these two points, it can be seen that the emergence of the Central European Treaty is actually caused by the international situation in Central Europe over the past year, and the two points it advocates are also aimed at this kind of international environment in Central Europe. Therefore, if this treaty can be established, the situation in Central Europe will naturally tend towards stability. If Italy and Hungary do not covertly harbor terrorists from the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and interfere in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, then they will not take advantage of others' danger by force and cause serious incidents. And if Germany can temporarily abandon its actions of assisting Austrian National Socialist Party members and its ambition to merge Austria, then all the chaos in Central Europe will inevitably have no way to erupt.</p>
<p>Looking at the harmonious relations between Italy, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Hungary today, it can be seen that these countries are all prepared to accept this treaty. However, it is still difficult to make a definite statement as to whether Germany is willing to give up its ambition to take Austria. Because Germany and Austria are nations of the same language and ethnicity. The merger of Germany and Austria is not only the desire of Germany, but also the desire of many Austrians. Moreover, from an economic point of view, it is also advantageous for Austria to merge with Germany. In addition, Austria's population is only one-tenth of Germany's, and the national power is vastly different. Therefore, it is extremely easy for Germany to take Austria if there is no international resistance. Recently, the result of the Saar plebiscite, in which the property returned to its rightful owner, made the Austrians overjoyed. Therefore, Germany has made propaganda advocating that the issue of Austria's affiliation should also be resolved by a plebiscite. From this, it can be seen that the guarantee of Austria's security is actually more difficult than that of any other country in Central Europe. Only because of this, the Central European Treaty, although it is a problem for all countries in Central Europe, is most concerned with Austria. From this, it can be seen that the Austrian Chancellor and Austrian Foreign Minister's separate visits to France and England are not without reason.</p>
<p>According to the European dispatches received in recent days, it is said that Schuschnigg has repeatedly stated that if Austria does not receive a solid guarantee, it will restore the monarchy to resist the encroachment of German forces, and that the restoration of the monarchy in Austria is currently necessary. It is also reported that if the Central European Treaty includes a clause prohibiting the restoration of the Habsburg royal family, it will be opposed by the Austrian government. From this, it can be seen that the merger of Germany and Austria is extremely difficult to achieve, and the political situation in Austria is not very stable. The stakes for Austria in the Central European Treaty are higher than any other Central European country. The political situation in Austria can only move towards stability when the Central European Treaty is established in the future and the great powers give Austria a solid guarantee.</p>
<h3>Court Ruling on the Yi Peiji Case in Beijing</h3>
<p>Yi and Li's Assets Seized by Preliminary Attachment</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The court's public announcement of the ruling in the Yi Peiji case states that the whereabouts of the two defendants, Yi Peiji and Li Zongtong, are unknown. According to Article 199 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the ruling should be delivered by public announcement. All assets of the defendants will be subject to preliminary attachment up to the value of 5 million national currency each. The defendants may provide 5 million national currency to apply for suspension or cancellation of the preliminary attachment. It is found that the case of Yi Peiji and Li Zongtong's embezzlement, forgery, breach of trust, obstruction of official duties, and defamation has been prosecuted according to law, with the civil suit attached. In addition to public funds, which can be counted in gold and silver, the remaining jewelry and other items are of considerable value. However, the original stolen goods have not yet been recovered, and the estimated value is difficult to determine. Because Yi Peiji and Li Zongtong are absconding without a trace, if preservation measures are not taken in advance, there may be difficulties in enforcement in the future. It is proposed to temporarily seize the assets of Yi Peiji and Li Zongtong, each within the range of 5 million yuan. The deadline for filing an appeal is within seven days from the day after the delivery of this document to the court. Jiangsu High Court. (28th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Asks Britain and the United States to Reopen Naval Talks</h3>
<p>Proposing a Compromise Plan as a Probe</p>
<p>[London] It is reported that Japan has recently asked Britain and the United States to hold naval talks again in October of this year in order to inform each other of naval shipbuilding plans. It is also reported that Japan, in view of the large differences between the country and the United Kingdom and the United States during the last London Naval Conference, now intends to propose a compromise plan, which is to request naval nations not to expand naval capabilities specified in the Washington Naval Treaty as it comes to term this year and next year. The tonnage of warships built by Japan is closer to the extent permitted by the Washington Naval Treaty than that of the United Kingdom and the United States. If Japan's suggestion is accepted, the naval strength of the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan will be 5:5:4 by the end of 1936, instead of the original 5:5:3. The Japanese government believes that this suggestion will be agreed by the United Kingdom, but criticized by the United States. British political circles believe that Japan had not raised such a suggestion in the last London preliminary talks, and that if the Japanese government can formally propose it later, it must be studied. But at this moment, many people believe that the rumor is only to probe the intentions of the powers and are unwilling to comment on it. (28th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Naval Officers Must Not Interfere in Politics</h3>
<p>Swanson Reiterates Warning on Broadcast</p>
<p>[Washington] Navy Secretary Swanson issued a radio warning today to all US naval officers around the world to disengage from politics. This is the most important of Swanson's documents warning naval officers not to interfere in local and central politics. Swanson said that when he ordered naval officers to restrain themselves and avoid getting involved in the whirlpool, he suddenly heard that a company was surrounding naval officers and planning to finance the scum of the naval community, hoping to pass the big navy bill. This act is inconsistent with the US Navy regulations. The Navy Department has repeatedly warned naval officers not to interfere in politics, so although most of the residents of Long Beach and San Diego are naval personnel, few naval personnel are engaged in political activities. Although the Navy Department admits that naval officers want to increase naval funding, Swanson does not want them to take any action that would make people suspect that it is a self-serving advertisement.

<h3>UK New Budget Military Spending to Surge</h3>
<p>Totaling Approximately 100 Million Pounds</p>
<p>[London] According to the "Daily Herald" and "News Chronicle," the UK's upcoming budget allocates approximately 100 million pounds to the army and navy, representing one-eighth of the total budget expenditure. This is an increase of 7 to 10 million pounds compared to the previous budget's military spending. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>"London" The estimated expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year for various UK civil and tax revenue agencies were released for the first time today, totaling £430,210,024, an increase of £13,930,000 compared to the budget estimate. This is due to subsidies for the meat, shipping, milk, and sugar industries. The Labour Department will only require £23,390,000 for the next fiscal year, a decrease of £44,339,250, due to reduced unemployment insurance costs. However, there is a new relief fund of £50 million for uninsured unemployed workers, although this task has been transferred from the Ministry of Labour to the Unemployment Assistance Board. Most agencies have increased their expenditures, but the expenses for diplomatic and consular missions have decreased by £25,000. The UK's contribution to the League of Nations is £166,500, an increase of £3,100. The celebration expenses for the King's 25th Jubilee are only £50,000, the smallest item in the estimate. As for the estimated national defense expenditure, it will be announced next week, and the figure will certainly increase significantly, as new air force squadrons have been added, the expenses for which were not determined last year. The national revenue is currently quite good. As of the end of last week, revenue had increased by £4 million compared to the same period last year. Income tax revenue is also very strong. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain had budgeted for a shortfall of £9.5 million for the entire year, but based on the actual revenue collected so far, it has already increased by £2 million compared to the same period last year. Observers predict a slight surplus this year, but tax cuts are inevitable. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Members of Parliament Raise Questions One After Another</p>
<p>[London] As authorities from China and Japan have recently begun discussing ways to improve diplomatic relations, members of the British Parliament are increasingly paying attention to Far Eastern affairs.

Labour MP Mr. Mander asked whether the government had consulted with the Dominions regarding the situation in the Far East, in order to consider what actions could be taken to maintain peace and the international rights under related treaties.

<h3>US Liberal Students Promote Anti-War Strike Movement</h3>
<p>North and South American Countries Also Respond</p>
<p>School Authorities Do Not Plan to Interfere</p>
<p>[New York] 100,000 university students in the United States who believe in "freedom" are today witnessing a strike movement. This movement is against "the various forces in the United States that are currently coercing the nation into war and pan-isms." Currently, there are four types of university student organizations that are encouraging strikes, originally planned for one hour, but according to reports here, it may be more than that. Officials are paying no attention to this matter, because the number of students in "freedom" groups in universities everywhere is very small. A leader of the strike movement said that this movement is not against the school authorities, so there should be no problems with the schools, because this movement is against the tendency of domestic nationalism and the militaristic attitudes of some quarters. It is reported that Canada, Cuba, Argentina, and Chile also have similar student movements. Students from other countries who support the plan of the Student Anti-War Conference have all been invited to participate in this international strike movement. It is reported here that Wisconsin and New York are the centers of the movement, because "freedom" groups are most powerful there. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>[Washington] Negotiations for the settlement of Russia's war debts to the United States have recently failed. Congressman Dinham and Senator Babbitt have both proposed resolutions to sever diplomatic relations with Russia. The State Department does not think so.

<h3>Saar Officially Returns to Germany Today</h3>
<p>Head of State Hitler Will Personally Attend the Solemn Ceremony</p>
<p>No Fewer Than Several Hundred Thousand Germans Come from Afar to Participate</p>
<p>The Whole Country Prepares for a Grand Celebration</p>
<p>Saarbrücken Tomorrow is the day the Saar returns to Germany. Celebrations will be held here, and it is rumored that Head of State Hitler will personally come to participate. However, Hitler's decision and departure time are kept strictly secret as usual. It is generally believed that under the current circumstances, the number of people coming from the interior to participate will be large. In addition, the German authorities will officially preside over police affairs from today, so ensuring Hitler's safety will be particularly difficult. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken The sovereignty of the Saar region will be formally handed over to the German government by the Saar International Governing Commission on Friday. A solemn ceremony will be held in the office of the chairman of the Governing Commission on Friday morning. Mr. Aloisi, chairman of the League of Nations Saar Committee, will first deliver a speech in French on behalf of the League of Nations. His speech will be immediately translated into German. Then, the German government representative, Interior Minister Frick, will deliver a speech, which will also be immediately translated from German into French. The speeches of both sides will be broadcast wirelessly throughout Germany. In addition, no fewer than hundreds of thousands of Germans will travel from all over the country to Saarbrücken to participate in the ceremony on Friday. These guests have been transported from all over the country in a total of 110 train trips, including 50 special trains carrying stormtroopers, labor union members, and personnel from other Nazi Party organizations. In order to prepare beds for so many people, thousands of tons of firewood and paper scraps have been transported from other places and spread in public housing and barracks for the guests to stay in, as other facilities are difficult to arrange for the time being. On Friday night, Germans will hold a grand public rally in front of the government offices, with approximately 300,000 people expected to participate. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken The Saar region will formally return to Germany on March 1st. The people are now enthusiastically preparing for celebrations. The stationed Saar International Army and French customs officials have now completely withdrawn. British Lieutenant General Brind, the commander-in-chief of the international army, set off for his home country today. Personnel from the Saar Administrative Commission went to see him off, but the Saar personnel among them did not go. Tomorrow, police authority in the Saar will be formally transferred to the German authorities. Mr. Bürckel, the German commissioner for Saar affairs, has taken various preventive measures, fearing that some people will act out of line during the transfer of power and attack political enemies, causing disturbances. Bürckel has ordered the newspapers to publish warnings, saying that if the Saar people take inappropriate actions against political enemies, it will damage Germany's external reputation, and their crimes will be equal to advocating Saar secession. At the same time, the entire country of Germany is also preparing for celebrations. National flags will be hung everywhere on public buildings. Taverns and cafes across the country will be open all night, and bakeries will sell a special bread, baked in the shape of an "S" (i.e., the first letter of "Saar") to commemorate the occasion.

<h3>Abyssinia Expresses Willingness to Resolve Dispute Peacefully</h3>
<p>Abyssinian King Writes to Mussolini to Seek Amity</p>
<p>States He Has Never Attempted to Invade Italian Territory</p>
<p>Unswerving Commitment to Treaty and Preservation of League of Nations</p>
<p>Italian Troops Continue to Deploy to the East African Front</p>
<p>[Rome] The King of Abyssinia sent a letter to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today, expressing a willingness to appease Italy. The King stated, "Our country has never wanted to invade your country's territories in Somaliland and Eritrea, and our country is happy to be close to your country's territories, because your country can assist our country." This letter is the first document expressing a compromise since the two countries had a conflict. The King hopes that all issues can be resolved peacefully. Another copy of the letter was sent to Italian King Victor Emmanuel III. However, at the same time, Italian troops continued to deploy from Naples and Messina to the African front. Last night, the Arabia, carrying many military supplies, and the Da Vinci, carrying 110 officers and 1,200 soldiers, set off. Although Italy has now received a letter from the Abyssinian King seeking amity, it has not yet made any response. Observers believe that the majority of Italy's military operations are due to the indifference of the Abyssinian authorities to the Italian-Abyssinian conflict, which damaged the face of a great power, so this was done. As for the League of Nations Committee, it is still meeting in the Abyssinian capital to discuss ways to resolve the matter peacefully. (National News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires Declaration [Rome] Today, the Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires to Italy specially met with foreign journalists to issue a declaration regarding Italy's dispatch of troops to East Africa, and requested that justice be upheld. The Chargé d'Affaires stated, "I solemnly swear on my honor that the Abyssinian government has not at all considered attacking the neighboring Italian Somaliland and Eritrea counties beforehand, and will absolutely not infringe on Italian interests in the future. And the King of Abyssinia is personally writing to the Italian King and Prime Minister Mussolini with the same intent. However, the Italian government disregards this and has been continuously transporting heavy troops and military supplies to the neighboring Italian territories, and believes that these active military actions are necessary to protect the Somaliland and Eritrea counties, which is completely beyond the expectations of the Abyssinian government." The Chargé d'Affaires added that Italy can save the trouble of transporting troops and munitions, as it has repeatedly stated that Abyssinia has no intention of attacking Italian territory, nor does it intend to do so. Therefore, I (the Chargé d'Affaires) now further declare that even if Italy later withdraws its last soldier and last cannon from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea to Europe, Abyssinia will never forget to move a single blade of grass or a tree in Italian territory. As for the claim that Italian soldiers and civilians have been attacked by Abyssinian soldiers or nomadic locals, it is not true. But if the Italian government insists on another account, then the Treaty of Friendship and Arbitration signed between Italy and Abyssinia in 1928, which specifies methods for resolving disputes, can be applied. I now solemnly declare on behalf of my King that I am willing to always uphold the League of Nations and Western civilization and not deviate from them." (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Will Not Diminish [Rome] After the Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Yissous, issued a declaration to the press today, Italian authorities stated that Abyssinia's great peaceful aspirations should be proven by facts. The Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires has made such declarations many times, but unfortunately, the facts prove the opposite of what he declared. Italy has no choice but to take precautionary measures. Moreover, the Italian government's attitude has been very clear. The amount of compensation Italy is demanding is extremely small compared to the severity of the events that have occurred. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>UK Feels Uneasy [London] According to reports, the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has become a problem that is causing the UK to feel uneasy. Until recently, there has been no progress in the direct negotiations between the two countries, and what has been discussed is only limited to the issue of the neutral zone. As for the demarcation of the border and the resolution of recent unfortunate events, they are not mentioned at all. Judging from Foreign Secretary Simon's expression in the House of Commons, the British government intends to find an opportunity to discuss the matter slightly with Mussolini, as there are rumors circulating that Britain and France tacitly approve of Italy's freedom of action in Abyssinia.

He also said, "When I feel that for any reason, or unfortunately for many reasons, I am no longer satisfied with my ability to shoulder the heavy responsibility, then I will not need persuasion and will know what my responsibility should be."

The Chinese, Japanese, and Hawaiian residential areas in the city were all flooded. Residents in the area were rescued by the guards summoned by Governor Blount. At the same time, the commanders of the garrisons inside and around Honolulu have placed the troops under the command of the municipal authorities. Schofield Barracks has also prepared special personnel and equipment to drive into the city to provide assistance when necessary. Winter vacationers who come to visit hotels are now stuck, no one has been seen on the most famous Waikiki Beach for about five hours, which is also a new record for the island. Reports from rural areas state that sugarcane and pineapple have suffered heavy damage, but the pineapple on the surrounding mountains and the plains around Schofield Barracks has not been flooded. Traffic between several small towns on Oahu Island and Honolulu has been completely cut off, as bridges and telephone lines have been destroyed. The total amount of losses cannot be estimated until reports from the suburbs have been collected, but it is roughly more than 100 million yuan. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Now Awake and Able to Recognize Words and Distinguish Right from Wrong</p>
<p>China United Press, Chicago - A Western woman, Miss McGuire, 29 years old, from Oak Park, a suburb of Chicago, suddenly fainted while putting on her coat to go out on the street on February 15, 1932, and lay on the couch. Since then, she has been sleeping with her eyes closed, without speaking or waking up. Doctors are helpless, and it has become a rare disease in the world. Medical professionals from various countries often inquire about the cause of this disease. To date, she has been sleeping for thirty-three months and has been given the title of Sleeping Beauty. In January of this year, while her mother (Mrs. Milly) was sitting by her bedside, she noticed that her daughter had opened her eyes and was looking around, as if she wanted to observe the state of the bedroom. The mother thought her daughter had woken up and was very happy, but when she called her name, she did not respond, and seemed not to hear her mother's voice. The mother was very disappointed, but after paying closer attention, she saw her daughter's eyeballs moving. She took out paper and pen and wrote words on the paper, saying, "Raise one finger." The woman slowly raised one finger. The mother continued to write, "Raise two fingers." The woman again slowly raised two fingers. From this, it was known that she could wake up and recognize words. She then bought a slate and chalk to write words for her to show her, so that black and white would be easier to distinguish when she looked at them. This news has been spread far and wide again. Although the woman cannot speak or get out of bed, it is expected that the day of her recovery will not be far away.</p>

<h3>Reason for the Assassination of the President of the Yomiuri Shimbun</h3>
<p>(Japan Communication)</p>
<p>At 8:40 AM on February 22, Matsutaro Shoriki, President of the Yomiuri Shimbun, was suddenly attacked by a violent man at the entrance of the company. He was stabbed in the left ear with a Japanese sword, and his injuries were very serious. Five doctors from the company's clinic immediately performed bandaging surgery. Although there was a lot of bleeding, fortunately, the carotid artery was not injured. Therefore, after one blood transfusion, the condition was not very bad.</p>
<p>The perpetrator's name is Katsusuke Nagasaki, from Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu, 30 years old. He graduated from the police training school and served as a patrolman in the Oji police station. He was very skilled in Judo and adhered to national centralism. Therefore, he joined the Jinbu Association and currently lives in the Judo training hall of the Jinbu Association. The president of the association is Saika Ieta. After the incident, he fled and surrendered himself to the Marunouchi police station.</p>
<p>According to the official announcement and the speculation of the Yomiuri Shimbun, Nagasaki's assassination of Mr. Shoriki was, first, to gain fame for himself, as a starting point for future activities; second, the Yomiuri Shimbun invited the American baseball team to perform at the Meiji Jingu Gaien last year, desecrating the dignity of Meiji Jingu; third, the newspaper showed sympathy for the "human rights violation" issue (i.e., the cases of Mitsuchi, Nakajima, Kuroda, etc., who were indicted for abuse and torture in prison, which aroused questions in the Diet); fourth, some free-thinking people in the Yomiuri Shimbun inevitably expressed their views. In December 1932, Sophia University and Gyosei Junior High School, due to religious reasons, refused to worship at Yasukuni Shrine, which was dissatisfied with the military. At that time, the Yomiuri Shimbun gave some sympathy to the school, which aroused the Jinbu Association's resentment and distributed leaflets attacking Sophia and Gyosei schools, ordering them to publish an apology in the newspaper. Nagasaki, who assassinated Mr. Shoriki, president of the company, claimed that he acted alone and did not collude with Ieta or anyone else. The police department announced this, and the Yomiuri Shimbun also acknowledged it.</p>
<p>In recent years, politically motivated assassination incidents unique to Japan have occurred. The reason for this is that there are more than fifty patriotic groups, and their members are mostly impetuous and straightforward. Among them, there are inevitably people who take direct action, following the "one kill one principle" advocated by Nissho Inoue and others.</p>
<p>Recently, activists from various patriotic groups in Japan have been giving lectures everywhere, promoting the crisis of 1935 and 1936. In addition to elaborating on the seriousness of international relations and advocating the expansion of armaments, they also painfully describe the suffering of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses in cities, the tyranny of financial capital, the difficulties of the rural economy, and the inability of farmers to maintain their livelihoods. They loudly advocate slogans such as "Overthrow the privileged class, return property to the Emperor." The left-leaning "underground movement" is very quiet on the surface, but the spread of ideas is very broad. The extreme right-wing elements are also broadcasting everywhere. Large cities are no exception, and even remote rural areas have organizations, and their power is very strong. This is also something worth noting for those who are concerned about the social situation in Japan. (Tokyo, February 23)</p>
<h3>Hopei Province Establishes Bureaus by District to Collect Taxes</h3>
<p>The Tax and Donation Supervision Committee Begins Work as a Temporary Solution to Rural Relief</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: The Hopei Province Tax and Donation Supervision Committee was established on January 10. In accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government, the committee members are appointed from local gentry without pay. The chairman is Gu Zhongxiu, and the members are Shi Zizhou, Zhou Yichun, Bian Chucheng, Chen Fangxian, Xu Yong, and Yang Tianshou. The standing committee members are Shi Zizhou and Chen Fangxian. After the committee was established, it has convened several meetings recently to determine the internal organization. In addition to one secretary-general, two investigators, and one clerk, there are not many staff members. The funds have been approved by the Ministry of Finance and are allocated from the province's stamp tax revenue. The sorting out of donations and taxes in the province and the review of harsh and miscellaneous taxes are being studied in order. The abolition, increase, and decrease of these taxes will be communicated to the provincial government separately after the study is completed, and the provincial government will instruct the Department of Finance to implement them. In Hopei province, the collection of taxes in each county is handled by eleven collection bureaus established in prosperous areas, while the counties where bureaus have not been established are contracted out to merchants by the county governments, resulting in many malpractices. The Department of Finance recently received an order from the ministry, instructing them to follow the resolutions of last year's financial conference. All taxes in the province should be taken back and collected by the bureaus themselves, so that administration and taxation are separated. This matter has been submitted to the Tax and Donation Supervision Committee for review. The Department of Finance plans to divide the province into thirty districts and set up tax and donation collection bureaus to collect taxes separately. In the future, the miscellaneous taxes of each county will be handled by the collection bureau within the designated area, and the contracting system will be completely abolished. The total cost is 1.5 million yuan. Now that the provincial treasury is empty, it feels difficult to set up thirty tax and donation collection bureaus, which will increase the cost by more than one million yuan compared to the previous contracting system (the annual cost of the contracting system was 500,000 yuan). Once the Tax and Donation Supervision Committee has completed its review, the Department of Finance will submit a proposal to the provincial government's regular meeting to decide how to prepare the budget.</p>
<p>The Hopei Provincial Government, considering the frequent disasters and rural bankruptcies in the province in recent years, has formulated temporary and permanent measures for relief and ordered all competent authorities to comply. The provincial government believes that the temporary measures are urgent and should be implemented before the permanent measures. Important plans: (1) Increase the number of rural credit cooperatives. Considering the current situation in rural Hopei, financial relief is important. Each county is ordered to actively increase the number of rural credit cooperatives, and each village should establish at least one credit cooperative in the shortest possible time, and gradually expand them to facilitate financial turnover. If there is a shortage of capital to establish them, the county government may provide subsidies and loans to facilitate their establishment. (2) Increase the number of rural credit cooperative federations. Cooperative businesses should be carried out jointly. All village credit cooperatives should contact each other to establish federations, formulate regulations, and jointly manage them to increase strength. (3) Promote savings in rural credit cooperatives. That is, rural cooperatives should lend money to members to facilitate economic turnover on the one hand, and absorb deposits and promote savings on the other hand. (26th)</p>
<h3>Grand Opening Ceremony of Pingnan Village in Kwangsi Province</h3>
<p>Pingnan is the Site of Di Qing's Conquest of the Southern Tribes in the Song Dynasty, Occupying a Page in Our Country's History of Resistance to Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>Wuzhou Communication: Across the river from Yongyuan in Kwangsi Province, there is a village called Pingnan, which in history is a place where our nation's conquest of the southern tribes achieved brilliant military achievements. During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, the Jiaozhi tribal king Nong Zhigao saw that the Song Dynasty was weak and led his troops northward, invading the territory of Kwangsi and seizing the area of Yongzhou (now Nanning), establishing a kingdom called Danan. The imperial court was shocked. Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty immediately ordered Di Wu Xiang (Qing) to lead his troops southward, launching a large-scale punitive expedition. The army reached Binyang, and Zhigao occupied the Kunlun Pass, stubbornly resisting. Di's army attacked for a long time without success, and they were deadlocked for several months. The supply of food and pay was about to be cut off. Di then devised a plan to lure the enemy, attacking through a side road. Once the plan was set, it was the Lantern Festival. Inside and outside the city of Binyang, lanterns were raised to celebrate. Di's army also held a large banquet for the guests, drinking and dancing, pretending to be leisurely. The tribal soldiers mistakenly thought they were wasting time and were not prepared at all. However, that night, Di's army's elite troops entered Guiren (now between the Three and Four Tangs on the Yongbin Highway) through a side road, attacking the back of Kunlun Pass, and then using surprise troops to attack the tribal soldiers together with the Guiren army. Zhigao was caught off guard, and with fires breaking out in Guiren, he suspected that Yongzhou had been lost. He did not dare to fight and fled south in a panic. Di's army captured Kunlun Pass that night and pursued the enemy, seizing countless spoils. The next day, they recovered Yongcheng. This was the sixteenth day of the first month of the fifth year of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty. Di's conquest of the southern tribes was successful, and his troops were promoted and rewarded in turn. After the tribal soldiers withdrew from the country, they still did not surrender and repeatedly took the opportunity to harass them. To avoid worries in the south, the Song Dynasty left Di's troops to garrison the area across the river from Yongcheng. Di's troops were mostly from Lu Province. They garrisoned the far south, reclaimed land, cultivated crops, and multiplied. Over time, they formed villages. The village was named Pingnan, which was to commemorate Di Wuxiang's troops' achievements in conquering the southern tribes. Since the village was established, it has been more than 800 years. On February 19 of the current year (i.e., the sixteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar), the villagers of Pingnan held a grand opening ceremony to commemorate their ancestors and encourage future generations. The villagers pooled money to put on operas. The entertainment activities included singing, dancing, ball games, fireworks, national skills, lion dances, etc. The whole city was empty, and the cheers were frenzied. Representatives from various organizations in Nanning participated in the opening ceremony, and the number of people attending was no less than 20,000, which was unprecedentedly enthusiastic.

<h3>Swatow Nanyang Chamber of Commerce Urgently Hopes to Improve the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Swatow Communication: The number of people from Chaozhou and Meizhou living in various parts of Nanyang for a living is more than 5 million. They all regard Swatow as the throat for entry and exit. The goods exported from Chaozhou and Meizhou must also pass through Swatow. Therefore, Swatow has become a hub for foreign trade. Merchants have organizations such as the Siam Suburb Chamber of Commerce and the Nanyang Chamber of Commerce, which serve as the overall group for exporting merchants. Therefore, the people of Chaozhou and Swatow attach great importance to the commercial treaties signed between our country and Nanyang. Among them, such as the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty, since it expired in 1929, the renewal of the new treaty has gone through countless setbacks. It was not until 1931 that the main treaty was signed. There are still supplementary treaties that have not been fully resolved to this day. Therefore, the new treaty has not been formally signed by both parties at this time. Last August, the French side urged the conclusion of a supplementary treaty. After half a year of exchanging opinions and discussions, it is said that it will be signed this spring. It is found that there were more than 300,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam in the past. In recent years, due to the decline of industry and commerce, the number has decreased by 100,000. Therefore, unemployed overseas Chinese are often seen returning to Swatow one after another. The cargo transportation business in the southern suburbs has also shrunk. This is truly a regrettable thing. Before the old treaty expired in 1929, the value of the commercial goods imported by overseas Chinese in Vietnam was about 50 to 60 million Vietnamese currency, and the value of Vietnamese goods such as rice and timber exported to China reached 100 million Vietnamese currency. After the old treaty expired, the Vietnamese government treated Chinese goods as goods from countries without treaties, and levied the highest tax rate, which increased by more than 20 times. Silk fabrics, paper, porcelain, tea, vegetables, and fruits were suppressed by the highest tax rate, and their total exports to Vietnam fell from 50 to 60 million yuan per year to 3 to 4 million yuan, a drop of one-twentieth of the original amount. At the same time, due to the economic elasticity and common relationship, the export of Vietnamese goods to China also shrank sharply in proportion. In the past few years, industries and businesses on both sides have suffered losses. Therefore, the people of Chaozhou and Swatow have a new hope and expectation for the signing of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. The Swatow Nanyang Chamber of Commerce has also discussed this matter and made the following resolutions: (1) Improvement of new regulations for the entry of overseas Chinese. All inhumane regulations should be abolished in the spirit of Sino-French friendship, such as the fingerprinting of new customers at the entrance, the treatment of people entering iron fences, and the shifting of luggage to the clothing box pavilion. (2) The entry tax on Chinese goods should be reduced. The transit tax, such as those transported from Haiphong to Yunnan and Kwangsi, should be treated according to the Siberian Eurasian cargo transit method and should not be subject to transit tax. (3) Reduce the burden on resident overseas Chinese. The annual residence tax (head tax) should be at least as good as the treatment in Singapore and Siam. (4) China rules the country by party. Party affairs personnel must not be monitored by spies for their actions or meetings, and party-state documents must not be arbitrarily inspected or confiscated. (5) Do not interfere excessively with the education of overseas Chinese. The restrictions on the curriculum and the compulsory hours of French lessons, and the restrictions on not having party-oriented teaching, and the strict selection of teachers, etc. (6) The inspection of local Chinese newspapers should be limited to sending manuscripts at noon every day, and many important news are missed. In addition, news that is irrelevant to local laws and regulations is often randomly removed, and there are no standard restrictions on the entry of domestic newspapers, magazines, and books. (7) Do not abuse exit orders. Often, intellectuals come to reside in the local area. If they are considered radical elements, an exit order will be issued. In the future, there should be proper restrictions. (8) The treatment of overseas Chinese children. Children born to overseas Chinese and local women, if they want to return to China, must find a store to guarantee them and limit the time to return to Vietnam. If the time limit expires, they must return, and if they die in China, they must report to the French consulate for verification and be subject to all kinds of unequal restrictions. It is also heard that the chamber of commerce will present these resolutions to the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee as suggestions, and hopes that our government will propose improvements when revising the attachments.</p>
<h3>Bumper Tea Harvest in Southern Anhui Province</h3>
<p>—The Department of Finance Plans to Formulate Tax Collection Measures—</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication: In Anhui Province, in addition to rice and grain, tea is also a well-known product. Such as Lu'an tea and Hui tea, all enjoy a high reputation at home and abroad. Even if only the Hui region in southern Anhui is counted, the annual operating income reaches as high as 20 million yuan. The areas with the most abundant production are Tunxi, Shexian, Qimen, Taiping, Shidai, Jingxian, Ningguo, and other places. Every year around March in the spring, tea trees sprout green buds everywhere, and tea farmers start picking tender buds and selecting and roasting them before Qingming Festival, creating the highest quality red and green tea for sale at home and abroad. However, in recent years, the foreign market has been encroached upon by Japanese, Sinhalese, and Indian tea, and the trade volume has gradually declined and is far less than before. Now the authorities and tea merchants both feel that the future is dangerous, and they are actively improving the methods of production and roasting, so that foreign sales can be restored to their previous state. It is said that the tea market in southern Anhui will be launched next month. Although it is after the bandit disaster, the tea production is still abundant. Now the Wuhu-Tunxi, Huihang, and Tunqi highways have all been built, and cars run frequently, making transportation very convenient. Therefore, the transportation of Hui tea to the outside world will be faster than in previous years. In addition, the Department of Finance of Anhui Province, considering that the tea market this year is approaching, specially submitted a proposal to the provincial government to formulate a schedule of tax rates for tea business tax in each bureau and three tax collection measures, which have been submitted to the provincial government's regular meeting for deliberation and a decision has been made to collect taxes according to the two and three schedules.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Recent News from the Prohibition Committee</p>
<p>Since the County Prohibition Committee launched the campaign for opium addicts to surrender themselves, there has been no shortage of opium addicts from various townships who have applied to surrender. They have been successively sent to the rehabilitation center. Recently, they have been vigorously investigating and cracking down on unlicensed opium smoking, sparing no effort. They have repeatedly achieved results and have been sent to the Prohibition Committee for questioning. Today, Sun Zongxiang, an investigator from the committee, discovered a man named Mei Aqi, who had relapsed after quitting, in a smoking den in Socks Lane and sent him to the committee for questioning. Dai Shiying, chief of the general affairs section of the Provincial Prohibition Committee, was sent to Songjiang recently with the mission of promoting the prohibition work. Yesterday, he was accompanied by Yao Naixuan, secretary of the county committee, and Li Rusheng, section chief, to inspect the rehabilitation center for a week, and then went to the Gongji opium shop for inspection. He is still in Songjiang and will stay for a few days. Opium shops in the county that paid the first installment of license fees are instructed to calculate the fees on a daily basis from the date of issuing the license, according to the provincial instructions, up to December. The surplus payment is used to offset the fees due in the second installment. They have now been ordered to pay the remaining fees within five days of receiving the notice.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Arbitrary Arrests of Good People Incite a Strike</p>
<p>Five investigators from the Provincial Prohibition Committee, Xu Suilin, Wang Weizhi, Wu Yangzhai, and He Bingfan, etc., were ordered to come to Taicang to work. On the night of the 18th of this month, they led a large number of armed police and soldiers, as if facing a formidable enemy. They met lawyer Lu Qi on the way and ordered the police to take him to the bureau for questioning. They searched the home of Zhao Danyuan, the former director of the stamp tax bureau. Zhao happened to be out, and they found nothing. Before leaving, they took Zhao's son to the county bureau and detained him, claiming that they had to exchange him for his parents to be released. The manager of the Taicang Daily was working in the office. These people ordered the servants to falsely claim that the county magistrate had asked him to come for a talk and arbitrarily arrested more than a dozen men and women. They were detained in the Public Security Bureau for three days and nights. The investigators themselves held trials. Although there was no sufficient evidence or reason, they were all transferred to the County Prohibition Committee and then to the County Government. After the court hearing, they were detained pending investigation. In the following days, they successively arrested six more men and women and detained them in the Public Security Bureau, causing public uproar among the citizens. In the afternoon of the 27th, they broke into the Leyayuan teahouse in the city to search, but found nothing. They detained the owner, Lu Ruisheng. All the merchants in the city were outraged because these people harassed good people and falsely accused people of crimes. They automatically closed their businesses, posted slogans, and announced the reasons for the strike. The situation is extremely serious. Details will be continued later.</p>
<h3>Soochow</h3>
<p>Communists Send Letters to Threaten Theaters</p>
<p>Recently, theaters in the Soochow area have successively received threatening letters from a reactionary group calling itself the White Blood Group. Although officials have ordered an investigation, there are no clues. Zhang Zuyin, a member of the county party headquarters specially assigned to inspect mail at the post office, found an ordinary letter without an address addressed to the Zhenguang Theater the day before yesterday. He immediately inspected it and learned that it was a letter from the White Blood Group Communist General Assembly to the theater, stating that they had received several letters, and they believed that the group was borrowing 5,000 yuan from the theater. Please hand it over to the person in the fifth seat in the first row downstairs during the second screening on the afternoon of the 28th, etc. He immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau, and Director Zhang sent a large number of plainclothes detectives to the theater yesterday (28th) afternoon to wait, but there was no movement. On the one hand, they are strictly investigating the origin of the letters.</p>
<p>Verdict on the Peasant Riot Case</p>
<p>Last winter, in the Soochow countryside, such as Xietang, the peasants protested against rent and rioted, burning the houses of the rent collectors. After the rent collectors filed a complaint with the local court, more than 30 rioting peasants were arrested one after another. After a thorough trial, the verdict was announced on the afternoon of the 27th: Zhao Gujin and Xue Mulin were each sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, Deng Aiqing and Liu Yuntai were each sentenced to four years, Pan Changgen was sentenced to seven years, Zhao Fumei, Hu Abian, Ma Daode, and Qian Chuanzong were each sentenced to one year and six months, and the remaining defendants were sentenced to one year or six months of imprisonment, respectively.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Large Gambling Den Broken Up in East Main Street</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, gambling has been rampant in the county. At around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, acting on a tip, raided the Yao residence at No. 70 East Main Street, where a high-stakes gambling operation was being run for profit. They immediately dispatched police to the address, arresting the gambling boss, Yao A'da, and gamblers Shen Daguan, Yang Shunbao, and 22 others, for a total of twenty-five people. The gambling paraphernalia was also confiscated and taken to the bureau, then presented to the main bureau for transfer to the local branch court for interrogation. Meanwhile, Director Chen instructed the First Branch to seal up the gambling den to curb the gambling trend.</p>
<p>Bandit Luo Sanxing Executed</p>
<p>Han Wentai, the head of Xu Xie Township in the Third District, was kidnapped by bandits late in the evening of March 20, 1933. When the ransom demands were not met, he was murdered. On April 28th of the same year, his body was found by the bandits hidden in a badger den near Zhangjing Bridge in the Seventh District. Subsequently, Wu Zhengrong, the Political and Security Chief of the County Government, and Xue Furi, the Detective Captain of the Public Security Bureau, arrested several bandits involved in the case, including Yang A'bao, Zhou Zhihe, Li Zhiping, Jiang Hanchen, and Luo Sanxing, in various locations in this county, Shanghai, and Suzhou. Han Wentai's body was also recovered. The criminals were separately sent to the County Court for trial. After the facts were confirmed, Yang, Zhou, Li, and Jiang were successively executed by firing squad. Luo Sanxing was sent to the local branch court for interrogation and detention. In October of last year, Judge Lai, in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, sentenced him to death, and the case was submitted to the provincial government for review. The provincial government has now approved the sentence and sent a document to the Jiangsu Higher Court, ordering the local branch court in this county to carry out the execution and report back the previous evening. The Acting Prosecutor ordered the police to bring the prisoner to court at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 28th), verified his identity, and took him to the South Execution Ground for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Please Waive Former County Magistrate Wu's Debt</p>
<p>Zhao Junjian, Director of the Zhenjiang Finance Department, reported that former County Magistrate Wu Bogeng took office on July 1, 1927, and left office on April 30, 1928, serving for ten months. During his tenure, he incurred a deficit of 3,319.166 silver dollars due to official duties. The majority of this deficit was due to the cost of dispatching police and suppressing bandits during the communist disturbances in the county in April 1928, as well as providing for the troops stationed in Jiading. At that time, the situation arose suddenly, and the suppression and defense required immediate action. The deployment of troops required advance payments. Any delay would have risked the spread of the bandit scourge throughout the county. County Magistrate Wu had already been ordered to transfer to the province, and he could have shirked responsibility upon departure. However, he could not bear to see the local area devastated, and with a sense of compassion, he resolutely took on this heavy responsibility alone. He was able to quell the major upheaval, sparing the county from devastation. However, due to the urgency of the situation, the funds used could not be handled according to normal procedures, and the accounts and receipts were incomplete. After leaving office and settling accounts, he declared that he would submit a separate report to explain the situation. Subsequently, former County Magistrate Wu submitted a request to your department for review, but it was not approved. However, former County Magistrate Wu is a humble scholar who was honest and upright during his time in office. After leaving office, he had nothing to his name. Ordering him to repay this debt is truly impossible. In June 1931, Shi Zuo and others detailed the reasons and submitted a report through the county government to your department, requesting a review and approval for waiving the payment, which was duly recorded. In recent years, former County Magistrate Wu has been suffering from chronic illnesses and bedridden at home, making his circumstances even more difficult. Local residents often visit him, and he always mentions with regret that he has been unable to repay this debt. This shows that he has a loyal and honest heart and is not intentionally delaying payment of public funds. Recently, we read in the newspapers that your department is strictly pursuing county magistrates who have not cleared their accounts. Former County Magistrate Wu is among them. Rui and others have witnessed his old age, illness, and hardship as he is being pressed for payment, and we cannot bear it. Therefore, we dare to make a plea on his behalf. We earnestly request that you, sir, consider his contributions to the locality, sympathize with his plight, and recognize that this debt was incurred due to temporary and urgent needs under special circumstances. We ask that you grant a waiver of the debt in a spirit of understanding. We await your orders with utmost anticipation.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Gu Rui, Director of the Jiading County Public Funds and Property Management Office; Dai Chunian, Deputy Director; Huang Shizuo, Chief of the First District; Chen Peiqing, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce; Zhang [blank][blank], Chairman of the Nanxiang Town Chamber of Commerce; and citizens Gu Heshu, Jin Chengyong, Zhao Dingkui, Xu Baoshan, Zhu Xifan, and Wang Huaimin.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Disaster Victims Starve Themselves and Commit Suicide by Fire</p>
<p>The Jiangdu Red Swastika Society reports that the 8th and 9th districts of this county have suffered repeated disasters. Last autumn, there was another severe drought. Countless people have abandoned their families and children, and some have even taken their own lives. The most tragic case is that of Li Yongbao, a farmer in his mid-fifties from the Northeast 6th Jia Lane in Tiepai Dian, 8th District, who, after going without food for several days, set fire to his thatched hut and died in the middle of the night. In addition, the Da Yi Jieying Hall has returned as many as 20 adopted babies this year, which proves that the disaster is extremely severe. Therefore, separate telegrams have been sent to the Shanghai, Southeast, and other branch offices, requesting fundraising assistance.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>River Dredging Causes Boatmen's Uproar</p>
<p>The dredging project of the Huangtian Port South Canal has already dammed the river and started pumping water. In the first step of cleaning the river in front of the dam, all boats had to retreat north from Huangtian Port and south from Sihe Lock, causing severe congestion. The night before last, hundreds of civilian boats gathered over seven hundred boatmen from the Qingyang area, leading to conflicts with the district office and the sub-station. There was a potential obstruction of the waterway. The district office immediately telephoned the county government, which dispatched the 11th Security Brigade, led by Zhang Pinquan, to Qingyang by car. Zhang earnestly explained the situation to the boatmen, and the civilian boats began to retreat towards the south of Xijing. It will take until the 27th to complete the retreat. Squad leader Zhang immediately dispatched a squad of soldiers to Qingyang to maintain order and reported the incident to the city yesterday.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Four Bandits Executed in Yu Dong</p>
<p>Yu Dong Town's Sanlong Rice Shop was invaded and robbed by bandits, and the shop owner, Shao Ximing, and shop assistant, Ding Haitao, were injured. The main criminals in the case, Yin Jinmao, Wang Huitao, Lu Haiqing, and Chen Mutou, were arrested by the security team, handed over to the county government, and confessed to the crime. County Magistrate Jin sentenced them to death, and the sentence was submitted to the provincial government for approval. On the 27th, the provincial government approved the execution by telegram. The four bandits were then taken to the execution ground east of the city and executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Negotiations for Electricity Price Reduction</p>
<p>The cost of electricity in Nantong city is 25 cents per unit, with a guaranteed minimum of six units per month. The joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce decided to negotiate with the Tongming Electric Company to reduce the price to within 20 cents per unit and a guaranteed minimum of three units per household, to bring the electricity fees in line with those in other areas north and south of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Opposition to Dredging the Tongsha River</p>
<p>Nantong gentry Chen Baochu proposed last winter to dredge the Tongsha River, which would run directly through Tonghai and Qi counties. At that time, the people of Hai and Qi counties, believing that the terrain of the three counties was high in the west and low in the east, argued that if the river were dredged, Nantong's water would flow eastward in the event of flooding, turning Hai and Qi counties into a swamp. They vehemently opposed the plan, and the proposal was halted. Now, Chen Baochu has joined forces with Tan Juenong of Haimen and Zhu Chuliang of Qidong to convene a meeting to proceed with the project. Yesterday, county residents Chen Zhichao and others submitted a petition to the provincial government and the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments, urging them to promptly stop the project to avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Meningitis Rampant in the Northern Countryside</p>
<p>Meningitis has broken out in the Xixu浜 area of the northern countryside and has recently spread to Wudian浜, Lianhua涇 and other places, running rampant. As a result, forty to fifty people are dying every day, mostly children. Hospitals in the city are now trying to extinguish the outbreak.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Businesses Petition for Rent Reduction</p>
<p>Due to the bankruptcy of rural areas, social decline, and last year's severe drought, business conditions in the towns and villages of this county are generally worse than the previous year. Now, businesses such as Xingan Da in Heshang Town, in order to maintain market stability and social order, plan to contact shops in various towns and cities to jointly petition the county's Party and government organs for assistance, referring to the example of rent reductions in Shanghai and Hangzhou. They propose to notify the landlords to uniformly reduce rents by 50 percent to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Once commerce recovers, the original rent will be paid again.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Kong Boards Plane in Beijing for Joint Trip North</p>
<p>To Discuss Important Financial and Economic Matters</p>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, at the invitation of Chairman Chiang and Finance Minister Kong, departed from the Hongqiao Airport at 8:30 AM yesterday morning, accompanied by secretaries Cai Shouchun, Chen Fengyi, and two bodyguards, on a Ford aircraft sent by Chairman Chiang to meet him. He flew via Beijing to Wuhan. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi will board the plane in Beijing and travel with Mr. Song to Wuhan to meet with Chairman Chiang. Mr. Song will stay at the Hankou branch of the National Goods Bank after arriving in Wuhan and is expected to stay for several days before returning to Shanghai. According to sources in financial circles, the invitation to Kong and Song to go to Wuhan is for consultations with Chairman Chiang and other financial experts on effective measures to deal with the current economic crisis in China. Therefore, the task they bear is of utmost importance. Furthermore, according to yesterday's North China Daily News, Chairman Chiang will convene a financial conference in Wuhan to discuss major issues concerning China's finance and silk administration. Key figures invited to attend include Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, National Economic Council Standing Committee Member Song Ziwen, foreign financial advisor to the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Lockhart, and Dr. Young. The convocation of this meeting is highly regarded by all sectors. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held earlier but was postponed due to Finance Minister Kong's illness. It is now expected to open within the next day or two.</p>
<h3>China General Chamber of Industry and Commerce Studies Currency Inflation</h3>
<p>Decides to Establish Special Economic Committee</p>
<p>Employs Yang Yinpu, Qian Chengxu, and Others as Committee Members</p>
<p>Requests Government to Convene a National Production Conference</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reports that the China General Chamber of Industry and Commerce held its second Executive Headquarters meeting the day before yesterday afternoon at the Yiyou Society. Seventeen committee members attended, including Guo Shun, Wang Yaochen, Hu Xiyuan, Wu YunChu, Yan Qingxiang, and Qian Chengxu. Guo Shun chaired the meeting and discussed important cases such as currency inflation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shenxin Issue: (A) Regarding the auction of Shenxin's seven factories, it was recognized that HSBC was infringing on national legal rights and that the government should be requested to negotiate directly to stop it from exercising property rights. It was resolved to issue four urgent telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry to explain the legal position and request emergency handling.</p>
<p>Currency Inflation: (B) Recently, the separation of financial capital from industrial capital has caused national economic instability. The financial leverage in the market is insufficient for turnover. Whether inflating the currency can provide immediate relief was discussed at length. It was believed that the purpose of inflating the currency is to increase the amount of currency in circulation to raise prices, which would naturally benefit industry. However, the implementation method involves the national currency system, and the industrial sector is only in an advisory position. Therefore, experts should be employed to conduct in-depth research and develop concrete plans before submitting them to the government for consideration. The final discussion resulted in submitting a petition to the government regarding the handling of both hard and soft currencies. Regarding the credit portion, efforts should be made to encourage the financial sector to issue more notes, while the industrial sector itself should also prepare for the establishment of material storage warehouses and organizational systems in preparation for the future issuance of price securities, so that financial capital and industrial capital can be linked together. Regarding this section, it was decided to establish a special economic committee in accordance with the constitution, employing Dr. Yang Yinpu of Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Zhang Xiaomei of the Bank of China, Zhang Naiqi of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Qian Chengxu, secretary of the association, to be responsible for research and planning.</p>
<p>Protecting Industry: (C) Currency contraction directly affects the business operations of the native banks themselves. Indirectly, because native banks lack cash, the production sector has no credit leverage to move around. The native bank industry has been a customary old economic system in China for thousands of years. The problems now affecting them have had a major impact on the national economy. It was therefore resolved to actively maintain it from the perspective of the industrial sector. At the same time, a document should be prepared requesting the government to explain the actual internal situation of the current market finance and to determine a method so that it can restore its past ability to operate.</p>
<p>Production Conference: (D) To seek a way out for Chinese industrialists, it was resolved to adopt the method of convening a production conference in accordance with the resolution of the Third Plenary Session. The original text, signed by Guo Shun, Wu YunChu, Yan Qingxiang, Hu Xiyuan, Wang Yaochen, Qian Chengxu, and 11 others, will be sent to the central government for request. The original text is recorded below.</p>
<p>Petition to the Central Government: To the Nanjing Central Political Conference, Executive Yuan, and Ministry of Industry: We note that in the resolution on developing industry passed by the Third Plenary Session on December 19, 1932, items A and B included the points of rewarding production, improving transportation, and developing markets. These are summarized in item A for handling, while the methods for achieving them are in item B, under the guidance of the government, convening a national industrial production conference to solve their difficulties. On December 5, 1933, your ministry (the Ministry of Industry) designated 93 conveners in various provinces and cities to be responsible for convening. On January 15, 1934, the conveners from the Jiang, Zhe, and Shanghai regions held their first meeting at the association's headquarters, and Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Wu YunChu, Cai Shengbai, Qian Chengxu, Wang Yunwu, Mu Ouchu, and seven others were elected as preparatory committee members. The preparatory office was established and began work that day. Regarding its work, the preparatory committee has held several meetings. During the February 1, 1934 committee meeting, your (Industry) Ministry also sent the Director of the Industrial Department to attend and provide guidance. Later, due to the government's subsidized funding and the implementation of the future resolutions, which could not be determined, the industrial sector was not active in it. In October of the same year, the subordinate association presented a report to your ministry (the Ministry of Industry) outlining the difficulties and requesting the minister, with the qualifications of a Central Committee member, to submit the two issues of the implementation of the resolutions and the subsidized funding to the Central Political Conference for a decision. Subsequently, an instruction with the code 工字第一○九七三 was received, stating that the preparations should be advanced to an appropriate stage before being submitted. Since then, the preparatory work has effectively come to a halt, which is deeply regrettable. Upon investigation, the situation of industrial production in our country over the past year can be briefly summarized as follows: In the yarn industry, cotton is expensive and yarn is cheap, and the price ratio between production and sales is unbalanced. At the same time, it is also manipulated by speculative enterprises, and the losses are alarming. In the match industry, foreign companies have come to China to set up factories, while also lowering prices to compete with us. The national output has decreased by 20% compared to the previous year. The flour industry has been affected by three price drops, with the lowest market price only worth a little over 1 yuan and 9 jiao per bag, setting an unprecedented record. Other industries, such as raw silk and silk fabrics, are either suffering from severe price drops or being dumped by foreign goods, leaving them all on the brink of collapse. This year's situation is even more dangerous than last year's. In addition to the problems of the production sector itself, there is also the common decline in the market and the panic in the social economy. All kinds of unfavorable environments are simultaneously forcing the producers to have nothing to produce and the laborers to have nothing to work on. The entire national industrial production is in danger of grinding to a halt in an instant. The subordinate association has witnessed the difficulties of the times and believes that the complicated relationships lurking behind the scenes caused the current environment. If the government could have protected the industry in advance, without harming it, and if the industry could have understood the government's intentions, abandoning selfish ideas and avoiding useless competition, then, at the very least, even if industrial development was difficult to achieve in the short term, the old state could have been maintained, and the industry would not have collapsed. Now, our country is facing economic difficulties. Under its abnormal circumstances, production has been disrupted. At the same time, all national economic issues that should be dealt with immediately are left hanging. Therefore, the subordinate association advocates that under the guidance of the government, a national industrial production conference should be convened immediately, expanding the scope listed therein, convening Chinese merchants, and inviting government and leaders in various sectors experts to jointly decide on a comprehensive production and sales policy for the revival of Chinese industry. Thereafter, it will be promoted along that path and direction to achieve a fundamental solution. In this way, not only will the resolution of the Third Plenary Session be realized as soon as possible, but at the same time, all current obstacles and various abnormal economic situations will also be eliminated as soon as possible and put on the right track. It is about reviving our country's industry, so we dare to urgently report to your ministry and request your adoption of the report of the subordinate association to the Ministry of Industry in October 1934, handling the matter urgently for the sake of public convenience.</p>
<h3>Special Committee of the Local Assistance Association Reconvened Yesterday to Discuss Market Relief</h3>
<p>The discussion centered on four items, resulting in satisfactory outcomes</p>
<p>The three banks met yesterday and decided to continue lending to maintain stability</p>
<p>The special committee organized by the Local Assistance Association to provide market relief convened a meeting yesterday, resulting in satisfactory outcomes. The three banks met yesterday and decided to continue lending to maintain stability. The Ministry of Finance has instructed all banks to do their best to lend. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Special Committee Meeting: The Shanghai Local Assistance Association held a meeting yesterday noon at the China Exchange Bank building for the special committee organized to provide market relief. Attendees included Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Bei Songsun, Tang Shoumin, Qin Runqing, Yu Huancheng, and others. According to a committee member who attended, the discussion focused on concrete methods for developing various industries, mainly including silver and money industries doing their best to provide loans and accept real estate mortgages. It is said that a total of four items were discussed, resulting in satisfactory outcomes.</p>
<p>Three Banks Meeting: The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications designated a large sum of money to be lent to the silver and money industries before closing accounts after 1934 in order to maintain market stability. Yesterday, Hu Meian, Deputy Manager of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank; Feng Zhongqing, Deputy Manager of the Bank of China's Shanghai branch; Zhang Peishen, Manager of the Bank of Communications' Shanghai branch; and others met to discuss methods. It is said that a decision was made to continue lending to the silver and money industries. As of yesterday, the total amount of continuous loans, including those not yet repaid, was approximately 4.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Market Relief: Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has separately sent letters to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications regarding the requests for relief from various industries, instructing them to do their best to provide loans to industries that provide solid collateral in accordance with the law in order to maintain market stability and enable various industries to develop actively. It is said that the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will comply with the instructions of the meeting. According to a Xinhua News Agency reporter's investigation, Article 8 of the Central Bank's regulations stipulates that it may not engage in speculative business or the following matters, such as the first item being the purchase of real estate or the acceptance of real estate as collateral for loans, except for real estate necessary for business operations, and the third item being the acceptance of goods as security for loans. However, due to the special circumstances this time, adjustments will likely be made.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Citizens' Association Requests Ministry of Finance to Recognize Implementation</h3>
<p>No Need to Issue Further Orders</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Association resolved three methods at the end of last year to submit to the Executive Yuan for a one-year extension of the closure. The Executive Yuan handed it over to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Ministry of Finance for handling. It is now learned that, except for item C, which pertains to local administration, according to the Ministry of Finance's reply to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry believes that the closure period for items A and B has already passed and there is no special impact, so there is no need for discussion. As for the request to instruct the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to allocate large sums of money, in recent months, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have repeatedly released large sums of money to adjust the market, especially before the closure, so that the market has been able to pass smoothly. The Association's request has already been implemented, so there is no need to issue further orders.</p>
<h3>Xu Xiuzhi Passes Through Shanghai, Departs for Hangzhou Today</h3>
<p>To Visit Huang Fu at Mogan Mountain</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Society, the newly appointed Administrative Vice Minister of the Interior, Xu Xiuzhi, arrived in Shanghai via the Pinghu train the day before yesterday, having passed through Beijing from Ping. He is scheduled to take a train to Hangzhou this afternoon, then proceed to Mogan Mountain to meet with Huang and seek instructions. After that, he will return to Shanghai and then go to Beijing to assume his post. A reporter from the New Voice Society paid a special visit to his residence on Avenue Dubail yesterday, and the following is a record of their conversation:</p>
<p>Departing for Hangzhou Today to Visit Huang First, Mr. Xu stated that he had no prior knowledge of the government's appointment of him as Administrative Vice Minister of the Interior. He only learned about it when he saw the newspaper after arriving in Shanghai from Ping the day before yesterday. Since the Political Vice Minister Tao Luqian is already in Beijing, he will probably assume his duties before me. I will rest for a while and then take a train to Hangzhou this afternoon to meet with Chairman Huang at Mogan Mountain and seek instructions on everything. Then, I will return to Shanghai and set a date to go to Beijing to take office. Since Chairman Huang went south, I have not met with him for over a month, and I am unclear about various situations. Therefore, everything must be decided after this visit.</p>
<p>No Major Personnel Changes As for internal personnel, there will generally be no major changes in the future. Chairman Huang's attitude towards handling affairs has always been focused on the matter, not the person. Currently, except for the Director of the General Affairs Department, Ge Jingyou, who has already been appointed by the government, all other personnel will remain in their original positions to ensure familiarity. Chairman Huang's health is not good, and his arm and nose ailments have not fully recovered. Therefore, he is staying at Mogan Mountain for a period of rest. The date of his arrival in Beijing to assume the concurrent posts of Minister of the Interior is probably yet to be decided.</p>
<p>North China is Becoming Increasingly Stable When the reporter inquired about the situation in North China, Mr. Xu initially stated that his position in the North was only as a counselor of the Political Reorganization Committee, which was of a helping nature and did not carry any direct responsibility. However, he could report on what he had observed from the sidelines. Mr. Xu then spoke freely, stating that the Ch察dong incident has been completely resolved without incident thanks to the understanding and concessions of the Japanese side. Since the problem that once stirred the hearts of the people in North China has been resolved, the region has become increasingly stable. One point that can prove this is that the old custom of welcoming gods and holding festive gatherings during the abolished Lunar New Year has been lukewarm for the past four or five years, but this year it has been extremely lively. From New Year's Day to the fifteenth day, firecrackers were set off all day and even all night long. This is probably a sign that the people's minds have been stabilized.</p>
<p>Hebei Had a Bumper Harvest Last Year As for the rural economy, it has also gradually recovered. Hebei had a bumper harvest last year. Hebei is a cotton and wheat producing area. Since the loss of cultivation due to the war, Chairman Huang has been making every effort to appease the people and restore their peaceful lives in recent years. Therefore, Hebei had a great cotton harvest last year. Hebei now accounts for the largest cotton production of all provinces in the country. In terms of finance, it has also avoided panic through various austerity measures. Apart from the local tax revenue, the central government has allocated very little in subsidies, currently only about two to three million. The above refers to the domestic affairs aspect.</p>
<p>Negotiations in War Zones Proceeding Furthermore, in terms of foreign affairs, since the organization of the War Zone Clearance Committee to deal with the various outstanding negotiations in the war zones, most of them have now matured. Japanese personnel, such as Mr. Mezdu, Mr. Takahashi, and Mr. Wakasugi, can all understand our situation and hope to resolve everything peacefully and bring Sino-Japanese diplomacy back on track. Mr. Takahashi is also scheduled to leave for Guanwai in early March to discuss matters with the Kwantung Army. After Mr. Takahashi returns to Ping after the talks, all the problems will probably be resolved one by one and come to a complete end. The core of these problems is the disturbance caused by bandits in the war zones, the poor quality of the old security forces, and the unruly behavior of Japanese and Korean vagrants, such as selling white flour.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the Ping Political Reorganization Committee Mr. Xu also talked about the recent situation of the Ping Political Reorganization Committee, saying that since Chairman Huang went south, the committee's affairs have been handled by Chief Counselor Wang (Kemin) on his behalf. Mr. Wang has a long history in politics and is extremely prudent and has a good relationship with all parties. He is a good choice. After his secretary general, He Qigong, resigned, Yu Jiaji succeeded him. Mr. Yu has been in office for a long time and is also very energetic in handling affairs. Mr. Huang Yingbai serves concurrently as the chairman of the Reorganization Committee and the Minister of the Interior, just as Minister He Jingzhi serves concurrently as the chairman of the Military Branch Committee and the Minister of Military Affairs. There is no problem with this. In the future, he can travel between Beijing and Ping at any time.</p>
<h3>Gu Mengyu Recovers from Illness</h3>
<p>Needs More Rest as Advised by Doctor</p>
<p>Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu has been staying in Shanghai for over a month to recuperate from his illness. It is now known that Gu's illness has gradually improved after being treated by the German doctor Noel. Gu originally planned to return to Beijing to resume his duties as soon as possible, but due to his weak constitution, he needs more rest as advised by the doctor. Therefore, his return to Beijing is expected to be in mid-March.</p>
<h3>Yu Feipeng Returns to China and Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Vice Minister of Transportation Yu Feipeng, together with Xu Tingyao and others, went to Europe in May last year to inspect military transportation. He has now traveled to various countries for a total of ten months. Now that the inspection is complete, Vice Minister Yu has first led a group of his entourage to return home. Yesterday, a telegram was received stating that he will arrive in Shanghai today on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Wilson. The local postal, telegraph, aviation, and other agencies have all sent personnel to the new Customs Wharf at 11:00 AM today to welcome Vice Minister Yu's arrival in Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, he will rest for a few days and then inspect the local telecommunications, postal services, shipping, and aviation agencies. The inspection is scheduled to be completed in ten days. Recently, the agencies have been rushing to prepare statistical materials for the inspection and are very busy.</p>
<h3>Ma Heng Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>To Participate in the Preliminary Selection Meeting for the London Art Exhibition</p>
<p>Ma Heng, the director of the Palace Museum, left Ping to go south to participate in the preliminary selection meeting for the London Exhibition of Chinese Art. He arrived in Shanghai at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday morning. The Shanghai office sent personnel to the train station to meet him. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Ma stayed at a hotel. At 9:00 AM, he personally went to the First Warehouse on Tianzhutang Street to inspect the preliminary selection of antiquities. In the afternoon, he visited Cai Yuanpei to discuss the construction of the Palace Museum's Beijing warehouse and the sorting of antiquities. He also plans to visit Chu Minyi to discuss the funding for the Beijing warehouse construction. Mr. Ma's stay in Shanghai will be approximately one week.</p>

<h3>Chen Gongbo Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Seek Relief for the Seven Shenxin Factories</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Yarn Industry Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Seem to Have No Strong Desire to Purchase</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, all sectors of society are very indignant after the British HSBC Bank arbitrarily undervalued and auctioned off the seventh factory of the Shenxin Textile Company on the 26th. The atmosphere within the city has become even more tense. The Central News Agency reporter has compiled the following report on the situation from various parties yesterday:</p>
<p>Minister Chen Arrives in Shanghai After receiving the news of the auction of the seventh Shenxin factory, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo left Beijing the night before last and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. However, the representatives of the Yarn Association did not get to meet with Chen to personally present everything. He is actively considering relief, which is something he intends to do.</p>
<p>Guo Shun and Others Petition Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, representatives of the Yarn Factory Association, Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, Liu Mengqing, etc., together with the director of the seventh Shenxin factory, Li Jiyao, and the secretary of the Yarn Factory Association, Zhang Zemin, drove to the Municipal Government to meet with Mayor Wu. The mayor had a slight cold, so Secretary-General Yu Hongjun met with them on his behalf. Li Jiyao, representing Rong Zongjing, presented the whole story. The three representatives, Guo Shun and others, requested the mayor to find ways to provide relief, and especially hoped that the government would provide strong assistance in terms of material resources. Secretary-General Yu accepted everything one by one. The representatives left feeling satisfied.</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department Sends a Frugal Telegram The National News Agency reports that the Municipal Party Department of this city, in view of the illegal auction of the seventh Shenxin Yarn Factory in this city by the British HSBC Bank, which not only damages our rights and interests but also has a major impact on the future of China's yarn industry, specially raised the issue at the 162nd Executive Committee meeting of the department yesterday. It was resolved to appoint five committee members, Wu Xingya, Wang Yansong, Lu Jingshi, Wu Kaixian, and Tao Baichuan, to discuss relief measures, which Wu Xingya convened. A telegram was also sent to the Central Government requesting instructions on measures. The original telegram is recorded below: "Urgent, Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the Shanghai Shenxin Seventh Factory has been illegally auctioned by the British HSBC Bank, causing the only industry in our country to be destroyed and the independence of the judiciary to be undermined. Not only is the yarn industry deeply affected, but other industries that have loan relationships with foreign banks are also in danger. Once the property rights are transferred, the thousands of workers who depend on the factory for their livelihoods will be unemployed. All sectors of the city are indignant. How should it be handled? Please review and instruct so that we can respond and maintain the industry. Shanghai Special City Executive Committee, please examine the seal with frugality."</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of Employees All employees of the seventh Shenxin factory held an emergency meeting yesterday morning regarding the illegal auction by the British HSBC Bank to act as a backup for the factory. More than one hundred representatives attended and organized general affairs, propaganda, documentation, public relations, logistics, accounting, and discipline groups to actively carry out the work. Unanimously resolved: (1) to elect ten representatives, Sun Zhenyu, Ren Wenyu, Huang Longhua, Jin Jian, Tao Lianyuan, Ren Xian, Zhu Agen, Fan Zhuying, Zhang Jinxiu, and Li Zhaodi, to petition the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau to conduct serious negotiations; (2) to contact relevant public groups, agencies, and newspapers to request that they uphold justice and provide active assistance; (3) the expenses will be temporarily borne by the staff, each contributing one yuan, and if it is not enough, other plans will be made. The entire audience was extremely angry at HSBC's illegal economic oppression and expressed that they would coexist and die with the factory, not hesitating to make any sacrifices. The atmosphere was extremely tense.</p>
<p>Assistance from Various Organizations The Chinese Industrial Federation held an emergency executive headquarters meeting yesterday. More than ten committee members, including Wang Yaochen, Cai Shengbai, and Yan Qingxiang, attended. Guo Shun chaired the meeting to discuss the auction of the seventh Shenxin factory. It was recognized that HSBC Bank infringed on national legal rights and the government should be requested to negotiate directly to prevent it from exercising its property rights. It was resolved to send four urgent telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry to explain the legal position and request urgent handling. The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Federation telegraphed the National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Justice and Administration, saying: "Please note that the British HSBC Bank, disregarding the court's ruling, illegally auctioned off the seventh Shenxin factory on February 26, which is obviously destroying Chinese industry and disregarding our national legal rights. The news has spread and the public is indignant. We believe that the auction of Shenxin is only a small local matter. If the entire country is forcibly auctioned off due to foreign debt, then how can there be intact eggs under an overturned nest? We beg the government (Yuan) (Department) to provide relief quickly and find ways to stop it in order to maintain the industry and uphold national rights. Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Federation, please examine." The Shanghai Citizens Advocating National Products Association held a meeting at its meeting place at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the illegal auction of the seventh Shenxin factory by HSBC Bank. More than ten people, including Chen Binghui, Fang Jiange, Lu Xingzhuang, and Xu Jianruo, attended. Chen Binghui chaired the meeting and resolved the following motions: (1) to telegraph the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Ministry of Finance, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry to provide relief quickly; (2) to telegraph the British authorities to stop HSBC Bank's illegal actions in order to maintain friendly relations; (3) (omitted). The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation issued the following declaration yesterday: "The fixed assets of the seventh Shenxin Textile Factory, including land, buildings, and machinery, are valued at more than five million yuan. In order to facilitate the turnover of working capital, it once mortgaged two million yuan to the British HSBC Bank. Over the years, it has paid more than one million yuan in interest. This time, when the term expired and redemption was urged, it was willing to pay off all the interest and repay a part of the principal, but the bank refused to accept it and arbitrarily auctioned it off, which is obstructing the industry. Therefore, this association convened an emergency meeting of the executive supervisors on February 27 to discuss relief measures. Everyone agreed that the property rights have been approved by our court to be seized by the Chinese Shanghai Two Banks, the second creditor, and the British Consul has been notified to check. It is reasonable that no one should dispose of it without authorization. The bank has disregarded the law and acted recklessly. It not only destroys our industry but also despises our national legal rights. How can this be tolerated? Therefore, it was specially resolved to send representatives to petition the Municipal Government and send a letter to the bank to urge it to come to its senses, and to issue a declaration to the whole country. If the bank insists on its own way and does not automatically revoke this illegal act, all citizens should carry out a strong mass movement and adopt the principle of not cooperating with the bank, and work hard to the end. This is a special declaration, we hope for your public attention. Shanghai National Products Factory Federation."</p>
<p>Attitudes of the British and Japanese Sides The Central News Agency reports that HSBC Bank's chief manager, Mr. Hutchison, not only admitted that the auction was legal but also shifted the responsibility to the Japanese merchant who purchased it, seemingly trying to confuse the public and reduce the negative impact on himself. The attitude of the British Consulate is also vague. However, Okamoto Lawyer, the representative of the purchaser, said that he would pay the money immediately based on the contract. However, according to a Japanese resident, he had asked the purchaser that if the Chinese merchants refused to hand over the property, whether they would use force to seize it. It is said that the other party has property, and we have money. If the other party refuses to hand it over, then we will not pay the money either. He seems to have no strong desire to purchase. If this is true, then there will be less resistance in the future negotiations. As for who the purchaser is, the Japanese side has denied the Toyoda, Dalian Steamship Company, Mantetsu, and the Japan Textile Industry Federation mentioned in the Chinese newspapers. Although all parties admit that Mitsui &amp; Co., which provided the funds, is also avoiding expressing its position, the news that it is a joint venture of Japanese merchants is still reliable.</p>
<h3>Anxious Residents in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Tries to Refute Rumors</p>
<p>Demands Authorities to Suppress Rumors</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Daily reports that the arrival of Doihara in Shanghai has attracted the attention of both Chinese and foreigners in this city. However, because of this, unfounded rumors have spread. Ignorant Chinese people living in Zhabei believe it to be true and are moving their homes one after another. What are the rumors? That Japan will soon occupy Zhabei. Recently, Sino-Japanese relations have been improving, but now there are rumors of Japan using force to occupy Zhabei. Such an extremely contradictory phenomenon should not exist among modern people in the 20th century. However, the rumors are not without cause. A certain land company in the United States, because there are many empty houses in the concession, is releasing rumors as a business policy to attract residents from outside the concession. Coincidentally, Doihara came to Shanghai the other day, and the company took advantage of this opportunity, saying that Doihara's arrival in Shanghai is concrete evidence of the occupation of Zhabei. A certain party also misinterpreted this statement and spread it arbitrarily. It is necessary to ask the Chinese authorities to correct such disruptions to people's minds. At the same time, the concession authorities must also suppress the rumor-mongers in order to reassure the people.</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that in the wake of the January 28th Incident, the Municipal Government is planning to actively rebuild Zhabei, which was turned to ashes. However, in late January, malicious rumors spread, saying that the Japanese army would occupy Zhabei by mid-March at the latest. As a result, the people of Shanghai believed it to be true. Residents living in Zhabei were as if a great disaster was about to befall them and fled to the concession, fearing another tragedy. A certain private school also began to relocate, which is truly laughable. However, the source of the rumors has recently been completely identified. A certain American construction company, because of a temporary increase in empty houses, came up with a boring plan to move residents into the concession in order to seek private gain and to alienate the feelings of the people of China and Japan. They released malicious propaganda, and a certain Chinese party also vigorously spread the extremely foolish rumors, saying that "Suzuki revealed his intention to occupy Zhabei when he met with a certain person the other day." At a time when Sino-Japanese relations are gradually improving, such rumors are really not worth a knowing smile.</p>
<p>The Nichinichi Shimbun reports that since January, rumors have spread that the Japanese military will occupy Zhabei, which has become increasingly rampant. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, rumors spread among brokers in the gold and yarn exchanges that "the Japanese military demanded that the Chinese police in Zhabei be prohibited from carrying weapons." As a result, people's minds were shaken. This kind of unfounded propaganda came from a large construction company run by Americans and a certain party that is most opposed to Japan. Our authorities (referring to Japan) have remained silent on this groundless and fabricated propaganda, which is incomprehensible. At the same time, we (referring to the Japanese) should respect ourselves and not be used by their rumors.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Public Security Bureau Director Cai Jingjun Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Arrives at the Bureau This Morning to Assume Office</p>

<h3>International Trade Bureau Discusses Selling Bleached Cloth to Nanyang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Manufacturers Believe That Exchange Rate Balance Must Be Studied First</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the overseas Chinese in Nanyang miss their motherland at all times and are always thinking of buying domestic goods but cannot find a way to buy them. Bleached cloth is sold in large quantities in Nanyang. If our merchants can go to promote sales, it is a good opportunity. The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, fearing that bleached cloth merchants are not familiar with the Nanyang market situation, held a discussion meeting in the bureau's conference room at 2:00 PM yesterday. Seventeen factory representatives, including Hongzhang, Qinfeng, Yongfeng, Sanxing, Dafeng, Xinhua, Dingxin, Qitai, Limin, Renfeng, China, Guangzhong, Guanghua, Lixin, and Dagong, Yan Chengfa, Zhu Zhenhai, He Guozhen, Zhu Gengtao, and others, attended. Guo Weibai chaired the meeting and Ji Zejin recorded the minutes. First, the chairman reported on the situation in Nanyang, and then the representatives of the factories expressed their opinions. As a result, in view of the low exchange rate, if they go to Nanyang to promote sales, they will suffer huge losses. It is necessary to hire economic experts to study the exchange rate balance before they can go. Other issues such as production management and economy were also discussed. The meeting did not end until 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Alcohol Factory Opens Today</h3>
<p>Minister Chen Will Personally Preside</p>
<p>The China Alcohol Manufacturing Factory, jointly run by the Ministry of Industry and overseas Chinese Huang Jiangquan, has a total capital of 1.5 million yuan and occupies an area of 151 mu.

<h3>The Special Committee of the Mechanical Federation Studies the Regulations on the Management of Steam Engines</h3>
<p>Sends Letters to the Central Research Institute and Four Organizations</p>
<p>The Municipal Mechanical National Products Factory Federation previously organized a special committee to negotiate against the French Concession's management of our country's factories. Yesterday, it specially sent letters to the Central Research Institute, the Engineering Society, the Industrial Safety Association, and the Jiaotong University College of Engineering, inviting them to participate in the discussion. The original letter said: "Dear Sirs, our association previously organized a special committee because the French Concession authorities promulgated regulations on the management of steam engines, the content of which was obstructive and difficult to implement. Member factories in the French Concession have repeatedly appealed to the association. In addition to submitting protests and requests for guidance to the Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Government, the general assembly resolved to organize a special committee. The first special committee meeting was held on the 23rd of this month. In order to determine how the steam engine management regulations are obstructive and difficult to implement, it is necessary to rely on expert guidance so that the negotiations can proceed with convincing arguments. It was decided to invite the Central Research Institute, the Engineering Society, the Industrial Safety Association, and the Jiaotong University College of Engineering to send personnel to participate in the meeting to facilitate research and provide assistance. We look up to your association for its extensive research on steam engines and boilers and its enthusiasm for supporting the national industry. In addition to sending separate letters, we are also sending two copies of the tenth issue of National Products New Voice (containing the steam engine regulations) for your reference. Please approve the appointment of representatives to attend the research to facilitate negotiations, and we look forward to your reply."</p>

<h3>Japan Again Expels Chinese Laborers</h3>
<p>Chinese living in Japan have been repeatedly expelled by the Japanese. Now, the Japanese authorities have taken a further step by ordering Chinese laborers working in Japan to return to their country.

<h3>Emergency Relief General Donation Society Relocates to New Address</h3>
<p>Since its establishment in December of last year, the Emergency Relief General Donation Society has made great efforts in handling various general donations. The donated funds have been successively remitted to the drought relief associations in various provinces for distribution to disaster areas for relief. The society continues to handle various general donations, hoping to achieve universal relief for the people in disaster areas everywhere. The general affairs department of the society was originally located at the YMCA on Sichuan Road.

<h3>Enthusiastic Solicitation of Aviation Patriotic Donations</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhuping Transfers Birthday Celebration Funds to Aviation Patriotic Funds</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhuping, General Manager of the Continental Press, the Current Affairs News, the Great Evening News, and the Shenshi Telegraph Agency, has devoted himself to social and cultural undertakings for more than 20 years. He is particularly enthusiastic about the patriotic movement. This time, in the Shanghai solicitation movement of the China Aviation Association, he was appointed as the captain of the No. 61 solicitation team. The solicitation work is very hard. This year is his 50th birthday. Relatives and friends planned to celebrate his birthday, but he declined firmly and wished to transfer the birthday gift to the Aviation Patriotic Fund to express his patriotic feelings. It is believed that Mr. Zhang has many acquaintances, and transferring the gift to the Patriotic Fund will be very enthusiastic. It is reported that the China Aviation Association highly approves and plans to set another memorial method to commend him.</p>
<p>Wu, the General Captain of the Shanghai Solicitation Team of the China Aviation Association, sent a letter to the captains of the first solicitation team yesterday, asking them to find out the members who have already joined, collect the annual fee amount according to the regulations immediately, in order to comply with the regulations and benefit the Aviation Patriotic.</p>
<p>After the captains of the solicitation teams started the solicitation work, they worked hard separately. Recently, they have repeatedly requested additional solicitation documents because the various solicitation documents issued previously were insufficient. More than ten cases are reported every day. It is reported that the office of the General Captain issued hundreds of membership books, badges, etc. to Li Tingan, the captain of the No. 154 team, Xu Peihuang, the captain of the No. 151 team, Yao Xizhou, the captain of the No. 223 team, Yang Meinan, the captain of the No. 202 team, and Wang Peisun, the captain of the No. 316 team, as well as solicitation movement lists, membership fee receipts, and donation receipts. This shows that the captains are working hard to solicit.</p>
<p>In addition, Chai Zifei, the captain of the No. 369 team, is the principal of Xicheng Elementary School. After receiving the letter of appointment and various solicitation documents from the General Captain, he immediately started work. All the faculty and staff of the school joined as members, and some students also joined as members. The remaining students all raised donations separately, and expanded the solicitation of members and solicited aviation patriotic donations outside the school. Yesterday, he specifically asked the office of the General Captain to reissue 2,000 membership books and badges, 20 membership fee receipts, donation receipts, and solicitation movement lists.</p>
<h3>Wanguo Chamber of Commerce Changes to New Recruitment Method Due to Lack of Members</h3>
<p>Taking into Account Both Regiment Affairs and Commerce</p>
<p>According to the current staffing, the Wanguo Chamber of Commerce in the Public Concession should have 2,467 members, but there are actually only 1,715 members. Although it has increased by more than 100 people compared to a year ago, there are still many vacancies, especially in the American and British teams. The commander of the Chamber of Commerce believes that, in order to maintain the security of the concession and defend it when necessary, the Chamber of Commerce must be emphasized, and it is urgent to recruit the full number and actively train them. However, among the merchants and staff, although they meet the qualifications of a member, they are in key positions in the company, and it is not easy to spare time. The commander of the Chamber of Commerce has now drafted a new method to divide these members into reserve members of each team. In addition to receiving considerable training and practicing shooting outside of office hours, they are exempt from mobilization unless it is extremely urgent and the business is suspended, so that both regiment affairs and commerce can be taken into account, and the recruitment can be facilitated. As for the Chinese team of the Chamber of Commerce, the number of members is full, and there are many reserve members.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of Hua Zhongchu Case</h3>
<p>Two Prostitutes, One Released on Bail, One Still in Custody</p>
<p>The Agricultural and Industrial Bank Asks for a Judgment to Repay the Loan</p>
<p>Ding Chengfu, Pan Ruilin, Zhu Minggui, and Hua Zhongchu, trainees of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, recently colluded to cheat, replaced banknotes with white paper, and embezzled 42,305 yuan of bank funds. Hua also took the money and two prostitutes, Ying Hong and Er Yuan, and fled to Hong Kong. After the bank discovered this, it reported to the General Patrol Room and ordered detectives to arrest Ding and the other four criminals and the two prostitutes one after another, and handed them over to the First Special District Court. The details of the repeated investigations have been reported in this newspaper many times. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the criminal court president of the First Special Court, opened criminal court to continue the interrogation. In addition to Eryuan Yan Caizhen being released on bail, Sanyuan Wu Zhihua was still in custody because she could not find bail. Judge Qian stated that the facts have been clarified and ordered the debate to begin. The patrol room lawyer Wang Yaotang and the lawyers of the defendants Wu Linkun and Wang Peiyuan debated each other. After the lawyers' debates, the patrol room changed the charge against the two prostitutes to receiving stolen goods. After the lawyers finished their defenses, Ma Shouhua, the agent lawyer of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, stood up and clarified the incidental civil lawsuit part, requesting that the defendants be jointly ordered to repay more than 16,940 yuan (including more than 26,000 yuan recovered in Hong Kong). The defendants were interrogated. Ding was willing to repay 1,900 yuan, Pan 2,715 yuan, Zhu Minggui 1,800 yuan, and Eryuan and Sanyuan 260 yuan each. Hua was willing to repay the balance of Ding and others. Judge Qian reviewed the confessions and announced the end of the debate, scheduled for sentencing next Tuesday morning.</p>
<h3>Another Chinese Cook Dies Tragically in a Brothel and Wine Shop</h3>
<p>Beaten by a Japanese and Died Immediately</p>
<p>The Court Ordered an Autopsy</p>
<p>Zhang Asheng, a native of Tongzhou, 34 years old, was a cook in the Donghua Japanese brothel and wine shop at No. 23, Lane 173, Zhapu Road, for more than a year. Unexpectedly, at about 9 pm on the 23rd of this month, he was beaten by a Japanese, Kita Kagaki (also a cook there, Zhang's superior), and immediately went to bed. The next afternoon, another colleague, Xu Jiangqing (also from Tongzhou, 25 years old), saw that Zhang's illness was getting worse, and reported it to the Hongkou Patrol Room. Detective Hu Guangrong was ordered to investigate and sent him to Tongren Hospital and the Chinese Isolation Hospital one after another. The treatment was ineffective. He died the day before yesterday. The body was moved to the autopsy institute on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Tang, a supervisory officer appointed by the First Special District Court, together with two forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, secretary Wang Zuyi, etc. came to the institute to examine the body. According to Xu Jiangqing, he was also a cook there and a colleague of the deceased. On the evening of the 23rd of this month, the Japanese was dissatisfied with the deceased, which led to quarrels. Then he was beaten by the Japanese. The deceased saw that things were not good and fled to the accounting room to hide, and then went to bed. Until the next day, he could not get out of bed, so Yu reported to the patrol room, etc. In addition, the deceased's father, Zhang Yongen, said that he lived in his hometown of Tongzhou and lived by farming. Now someone told me that my son was beaten to death by a Japanese, so I rushed to Shanghai and asked for justice. I have no money for a coffin, etc. Because Tang could not see the cause of death from the appearance of the deceased, he informed the two forensic doctors Wei and Zhang to autopsy the body and then review it.</p>
<h3>Longhua Temple Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Yuan Zhao Sentenced to Six Years in Prison</p>
<p>And Fined Six Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The abbot of Longhua Temple, Monk Xingkong, and Monk Minfeng of Hongshan Temple in Nan Shi, West of Dananmen on Zhonghua Road, sued the former abbot Yuan Zhao for infringing on temple property in the District Court one after another, and they were publicly prosecuted. The examining officer believed that the case was clear, the debate was over, and the sentence was awaiting. Yan Wanglong, Yuan Zhao's nephew, claimed that the land of the Hongshan Temple base belonged to his family, and the newly built 24 buildings and 12 city houses, 32 yuan per building, and 12 residential buildings, 28 yuan per building, collected a total of 720 yuan per month, which he shared with Yuan Zhao. For the sake of caution, the examining officer secretly investigated the various places and the truth was revealed. Therefore, Yan Wanglong was detained and ordered to hand over his business license to facilitate the transfer to the procuratorate for investigation. It is now learned that the case was specially opened by Judge Shao Qinzhi in the Third Court at 3 pm yesterday. The plaintiff Xingkong did not arrive and entrusted lawyers Pan Zhensheng and Zou Yu to the court. The examining officer ordered the imprisoned Yuan Zhao to come to the case. After briefly interrogating his age and籍贯, he stood up in court and announced the sentence, saying that you committed two consecutive embezzlement crimes, and the embezzlement of the Longhua Temple part was quite a lot, while the Hongshan Temple part was completely inconsistent with the facts. You first said that the Hongshan Temple base belonged to the Hong family, then suddenly said that it belonged to the Yan family, and finally said that it belonged to Ling Guyu. The various contradictions before and after were self-defeating, which clearly showed that what you said before was all castles in the air. Moreover, you said before that the Hongshan Temple base was rented from the Hong family, and it would expire in the 16th year of the Republic of China, and you also said that the house was rented in the Xuantong era, but how could you know in advance that it would be changed to the Republic of China after Xuantong, which is very strange and the situation is clearly hypocritical. Now the sentence is four years imprisonment for each of your two embezzlement crimes, and a fine of 3,000 yuan, and a combined sentence of six years imprisonment and a fine of 6,000 yuan. The private prosecution part of Longhua Temple is transferred to the Civil Court for handling, and the incidental civil lawsuit of Minfeng is not in accordance with the law and the judgment is dismissed. Yuan Zhao, after hearing the judgment, immediately applied for dissatisfaction. The examining officer ordered that an appeal can be filed in accordance with the law, and ordered him to be taken back to custody to await instructions.</p>
<h3>Inhumanly Electrocuted Apprentice Tied Up</h3>
<p>Suspected of Stealing Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The Tailor Shop Partner Took Vengeance</p>
<p>Yan Lu, a woman from Jiading, is 47 years old and lives in Nanhongxiang countryside. Last year, she entrusted her 14-year-old son, Fusheng, to be introduced to Shanghai and recommended to Wu Yan, a relative from the same hometown (24 years old this year), who opened a tailor shop at No. 356 Xujiahui Road, French Concession, as an apprentice. Recently, the shop lost ten yuan, and it was suspected that the apprentice Fusheng stole it. He was tied up by Chen Awu, a tailor from the same hometown (39 years old this year), and electrocuted Fusheng's legs to intimidate him and hand over the stolen money. However, Fusheng did not steal and could not hand it over, resulting in being subjected to illegal punishment and injuring his legs. Now, Fusheng's mother, Yan Lu, learned about it in the countryside, came to Shanghai to visit her son, and knew that the leg injuries were very serious and could not bear the pain. So she reported to the French Patrol Room the day before yesterday afternoon, and sent detectives to arrest Chen Awu. Yesterday, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Special Second Court. Patrol Room lawyer Yuan Jiahong clarified the case and prosecuted him for injury under Article 293 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiff Yan Lu and the victim Yan Fusheng, mother and son, did not appear in court. After Judge Wu Fanglian reviewed the report and briefly interrogated the defendant, he ordered the defendant Chen Awu to be returned to custody and to be interrogated again on March 6. He also asked the detectives to notify the victim to come to the court tomorrow (today) to report to the forensic doctor for examination of injuries and review.</p>
<h3>Changshu Small Wheel Two Robberies Inland River Shipping Association Please Seriously Arrest</h3>
<p>The wheel boats traveling between Shanghai, Changshu, and Dangku have been robbed twice by bandits in Jiading County in the past month, resulting in heavy losses. The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Industry Association believes that the rampant banditry is related to the safety of travelers and specially presented it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Jiading County Government, and other agencies yesterday, requesting a serious arrest. The original submission is as follows: Commercial ships have been repeatedly robbed, a list of losses has been compiled, and the situation has been reported. Please order the subordinates to strictly arrest them, and be sure to investigate and deal with them, so as to ensure the safety of travelers and maintain the shipping industry. According to a letter from the Shenxi United Public Bureau, the Shenqinban (Shanghai to Changshu) and Shendangban (Shanghai to Dangku Pingjiang) wheel boats belonging to the bureau towed the ships of Tongxing and Yuanli companies with passengers leaving the port at 4 pm on January 28. At 9:15 pm, when passing Zhangjiabang, Yinxingshutou in Jiading County, a ferry boat suddenly came towards them, firing a gun to intercept them. More than ten people speaking the local dialect jumped onto the company's ship with guns, rummaged through boxes and cabinets, and searched everyone. None of the passengers on the two ships were spared, and they were not satisfied, and stripped the clothes off the people. When they heard the sound of a steam whistle in front, they knew that a wheel boat was coming, and then they carried the stolen goods and jumped back to the original ship and escaped. After checking the losses of the two ships, it amounted to more than 300 yuan. They immediately issued a list of losses and reported it to the Second Team of the Nanhongxiang Water Public Security Bureau of Jiading for strict arrest. Unexpectedly, less than two weeks later, the previous case was not solved, and new cases came one after another. On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, the bureau's Xie Mao wheel boat towed the ships of Taian and Tongyun companies, loaded with passengers and sailed. At 10:30 pm, when passing Panlonggang in Jiading County, a canopy-less boat drove in front, and the people in the boat shouted in unison to stop the boat. More than ten people wearing felt hats and long gowns, and one person wearing a Zhongshan suit, all speaking a mixed local dialect, most of them holding pistols, crowded onto the ship and searched wildly. First, the passengers on the Taian ship were searched, then Tongyun. None of the passengers on the ship were spared. All the money and ornaments were looted. After about a quarter of an hour, they screamed and escaped by boat. The location of the incident was six or seven miles away from the Wangmiao police station. It was because it was late at night and the place was barren, so they did not dare to drive back to report. It was found that the losses of the people who were robbed in this case amounted to more than 460 yuan. The bureau has been washed away twice in less than a month, the trauma is huge and it is difficult to control itself (omitted). According to this, the association sent personnel to investigate and found that the Zhangjiabang and Panlonggang areas are all in Jiading County. That place is an important road, and the number of boats coming and going is difficult to count. The losses are not mentioned for the time being, what about the local security? According to the previous report, in addition to reporting to the local county government, please strictly arrest them, and especially issue a list of losses and present it to the court for verification and order the subordinates to strictly arrest them, so as to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Formulates Road Plan</h3>
<p>Drawings Open for Public Objection</p>
<p>The Public Concession road plan for this year, including the extension, widening, and acquisition of land, has been drafted by the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council. It is now on public display in the office of the Third Road. From now on, for three months, all landowners concerned can submit objections in writing to the Municipal Council if they have any objections to the various items proposed in the drawings.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Plans to Build New Central Fire Station</h3>
<p>The Fire Department of the Municipal Council believes that the current Central Fire Station urgently needs to be rebuilt, and plans to use the Xiamen Road prison site to rebuild it. The entire plan is to combine the Central and Xinzha stations into one, equipped with a repair factory, storage warehouse, the general office of the Fire Department, and the residence of 250 Chinese staff members and their families. The total construction cost is estimated to reach 2.6 million yuan. After the proposal was discussed in the Police Committee, it was considered that part of the land on Xiamen Road is currently used as a branch and workshop of the Public Works Department, which is inconvenient to relocate. Moreover, the general office and residence of the Fire Department can be slowed down this year. After deliberation, it was decided to allocate 100,000 yuan for the construction of part of the Central Fire Station this year. The regular expenses of the Fire Department in 1935, after being reduced, were listed as 1,179,830 yuan, an increase of about 5.06% over the previous year. Regarding personnel, only four of the Chinese trainees recruited in 1931 are currently on duty, two of whom have been promoted to lower-level officers. Regarding equipment, the new cost of water hoses was reduced to 35,000 yuan. It is also planned to add a high-pressure machine to cope with fires in high-rise buildings. The machine costs about 48,000 yuan. It is found that there are quite a few high-rise buildings in the boundary that are more than 200 feet high, and the existing fire-fighting machine power is difficult to be effective above 130 feet. Most of the high-rise buildings have been equipped with sprinkler systems, which can generally suppress the fire, but the danger may inevitably arise from the surrounding flammable houses. The Public Works Department may consider revising the building regulations and also limiting the height of buildings facing the open space. It was then decided to purchase the high-pressure machine when there are funds, and the other budget items will be submitted to the Finance Department for amendment and then to the Finance Committee for review.</p>

<h3>Woman Accuses Husband of Forcing Her into Prostitution</h3>
<p>The Husband Narrates Her Unchaste Behavior</p>
<p>Zhang Yutang, a native of Ningbo, is 28 years old and lives at 18 Hongxiang Lane, Xinzha Road. On October 29 of the 17th year of the Republic of China, he married a fellow villager, Miss Yuan Xiuying, through a matchmaker. The feelings between the two were initially strong, but later Xiuying's heart suddenly changed. She was often dissolute outside and did not abide by the rules of a wife. Zhang once entrusted relatives to persuade the woman's family, but Xiuying refused. In December of last year, Zhang found out that she was hiding on the upper floor of a cigarette paper shop at 268 Route des Soeurs, with her lover, Mr. A. He was just about to start suing when Xiuying took the initiative and recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Zhang Yutang in the First Special District District Court, requesting a divorce. The lawsuit stated that her husband and his parents opened a brothel, and because she was young, they also intended to force her into prostitution, soliciting customers along the way. Because she was born pure, she did not want to follow the custom, so she strictly refused and was beaten and abused frequently. Helplessly, she went to a labor agency to work as a female worker. From then on, the couple seemed like strangers. It was found that the defendant's family raised many prostitutes, which had already violated the criminal law, and forcing her to join them was a complete break in affection and righteousness. Therefore, she requested permission for a divorce and an order for a one-time payment of alimony of 1,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the plaintiff failed to appear after being summoned. After the defendant Zhang Yutang stated the circumstances of his wife's unchaste behavior, Judge Zhang Qinglan ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Gang Robs Drunken Westerner, Sentenced to Punishment</h3>
<p>Recently, there is a kind of rickshaw puller who specializes in pulling drunken Westerners in the Hongkou area to brothels or酒排 (small drinking establishment) for entertainment. When they get out of the car, they gather a gang to rob their property and divide the spoils. This is truly endless. At about 3:00 AM on the 1st of last month, a Westerner named 剖生 from an American merchant ship hired a car on Broadway Road to go to a酒排 (small drinking establishment) on Zhoushan Road for entertainment. Just as he arrived at the door, he was robbed of a wallet by rickshaw pullers Wang Lüyang, Gu Hongsheng, Wang Dingtai, and Chen Deshun from Jiangbei, containing many American dollars worth 340 yuan. They fled. The Hongkou patrol房 (police station) in charge sent Chinese detective Wang Runhe to arrest Wang, Lü, Yang, and others one after another and escort them to the First Special District Court. The plaintiff 剖生 could not appear in court to testify because the ship was sailing to the United States. It was found that Gu was the leader.工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) lawyer Li Zhishan requested a severe punishment. He was ordered to wait for the sentence. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Gu Hongsheng to four years and six months of imprisonment, Wang Lüyang and Wang Dingtai to three years each, and Chen Deshun (receiving stolen goods) to eight months. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be reduced by one day for every two days of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Pharmacy Partner Comes to Shanghai to Purchase Award Tickets with Counterfeit Silver Dollars, Fined</h3>
<p>The World Pharmacy in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, recently sent partner Li Houfu to Shanghai to purchase goods. He resided at No. 2, Lane 5, Molifang Street, French Concession, Room 11 of the Heji Trading Company. On the evening of the 24th of last month, Li went to the Hui Li Qiu (回力球, jai alai) stadium on Avenue Albert, and put forth one copper dollar to purchase an award ticket. He was immediately caught, detained, and reported to the police station. Detective Sui Wenzhi went to arrest Li and found four copper counterfeit silver dollars and one yuan each of哑板药水 (a type of medicine) and secondary silver dollars on his person. The next day, he was escorted to the Second Special District Court. The police station charged him with the crime of using counterfeit currency in accordance with Article 212 of the Criminal Law. According to Li's confession, the silver dollars were brought from Xi'an to Shanghai to purchase goods. They can be used in Xi'an. He requested that Lu Haibo, the manager of Heji Trading Company, and Chen Ziliang, a fellow resident from Xi'an, be summoned to court for questioning. He was ordered to be detained and the hearing was postponed for further testimony and verification. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. According to witness Lu Haibo, the silver dollars are commonly used in Xi'an City, but cannot be used in Shanghai. Li Houfu did not know the situation in Shanghai, so he mistakenly used them. I can be responsible for guaranteeing him, etc. Chen Ziliang's testimony was the same as Lu's. Then, after a debate by police lawyer Zhang Shouxu, the court immediately announced the conclusion and sentenced Li Houfu to a fine of 20 yuan for receiving and using a general currency that he knew had a reduced weight. If he was unable to pay, one yuan would be deducted for each day of detention. Seven yuan of foreign currency was confiscated. During the appeal period, the defendant was ordered to provide a surety of 1,000 yuan to be summoned at any time. If no surety was provided, he would be detained.</p>
<h3>The Cheng Xu Mother and Daughter are Convicted of Fraud and Fined</h3>
<p>Kuang Cheng, the second daughter-in-law of Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai Market in this city, colluded with her mother, Cheng Xu, in November of last year to purchase two diamond rings from the Yin Cunfu family, who owned real estate in Xilinhou Road, outside the West Gate. The agreed price was 2,900 yuan, but only 1,000 yuan was paid, and the balance was delayed in being repaid. Yin repeatedly demanded payment, but the mother and daughter could not be found. In desperation, Yin sued the Second Special District Court. As a result, Cheng Xu was sentenced to two years of imprisonment, and because of jurisdictional issues, Yin Cunfu filed a lawsuit with the Nanshi District Court against Kuang Cheng, stating the facts. Prosecutor Wu Deying investigated and filed a public prosecution on the charge of defrauding property. Judge Chen Jingyi held an open trial, and Cheng Xu was transferred to court for interrogation. After questioning, he was ordered to be returned to custody. Kuang Cheng was ordered to provide a suitable surety to be released pending instructions. This was reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that the case was pronounced by Judge Chen at 4:00 PM yesterday. He ordered Cheng Xu to be brought to the case for a few words of questioning. He then stood up and announced the judgment, which stated that Cheng Xu was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for defrauding other people's property, and was ordered to return the 650 yuan of private prosecution. Kuang Cheng was sentenced to a fine of 400 yuan and was jointly liable with Cheng Xu for 900 yuan of the private prosecution. Cheng Xu refused to accept the sentence and asked the official, "You should submit reasons and appeal according to the law." After the order was completed, he was ordered to be returned to custody. Kuang Cheng did not arrive and will wait for the judgment to be served.</p>

While walking along a small river, she accidentally dropped the sickle in her hand into the river. Longbao was greatly alarmed, fearing that she would be blamed when she returned home. She bent down to pick it up, but unexpectedly fell into the river. Her head was submerged in the bottom of the river, and her feet were pointing towards the sky. She died instantly. Because there were few pedestrians in the area, it was not noticed at the time. It was not until evening that Yang Xiaoqi was deeply alarmed when he saw that Longbao had not returned home. He went out to follow and search. When he arrived at the small river, he found the bamboo basket that Longbao had been carrying abandoned there. Knowing that something was wrong, he looked around and found that Longbao had drowned in the river. He couldn't help but mourn greatly. The incident was discovered by the police station in charge.

<h3>New Life Movement Promotion Association Actively Organizes Service Corps</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Letter to Comrades in the City was Issued</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association of this city, in order to actively implement the New Life Movement, has planned to organize a New Life Movement Youth Service Corps. In order to make comrades in the city understand the meaning and join the plan as soon as possible, a letter to comrades in the city was issued yesterday. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Necessity of the New Life Movement: Life is the general term for all human activities. With the passing and changes of human life, times, and environment, the methods and approaches of its evolution must also be renewed day by day in order to thrive. Under the aggression and oppression of imperialism for a hundred years, the Chinese nation's culture has fallen into a whirlpool, and life has long been out of order. The four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame have gradually been despised. Corruption and degeneration have first rejected society, causing the country's status to decline and the nation's life to be in danger. At this time, if we want to save the crisis, we must use extraordinary means to eliminate the habits of our people that do not conform to the times and are not suitable for the environment, so that they tend to rationalize life. This is the life revolution of our entire nation and the necessary and fundamental condition for the revival of the nation.</p>
<p>The Meaning of the Youth Service Corps: Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement, various places have competed to promote it, and the results have been remarkable. However, this movement is not just a temporary enthusiasm and should be promoted for a long time. The organization of the Youth Service Corps aims at sustained movement, which will become stronger over time. Moreover, the New Life Movement contains the meaning of changing the atmosphere. It starts with oneself and responds to others, from near to far, from shallow to deep. It is especially important to persuade and supervise, and to move forward at the same pace. The organization of the Youth Service Corps hopes that our energetic youth will practically shoulder the responsibility of promoting the movement and engage in the work of persuasion and investigation in order to eliminate the dirty and chaotic bad habits in society and cultivate the vitality and integrity in society. The mission is important, and only the Youth Service Corps can fully undertake it.</p>
<p>Please Join Our Corps to Work: The urgency of the New Life Movement for China's current needs and the importance of the mission of the Youth Service Corps for the New Life Movement have been described above. All of us ambitious youths should recognize our responsibilities, follow the purpose of saving ourselves and others, rise up in unison, and join together. Moreover, our party members and comrades, believing in doctrines and devoting themselves to the revolution, have long held great ambitions. We should especially take the lead in joining, widely persuade friends, and come to serve together. Extend oneself to others and work together with one heart. This is a practical, effective, fundamental, and necessary work, so that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame can regain their glory today, and the country and nation can gain vitality. At the same time, resolutely correct deviations and save shortcomings, and bring the life of the entire nation back on track, so that life can flourish, survival can be guaranteed, and livelihoods can be developed. We will see the Chinese nation shining brilliantly and making a unique contribution. We must make our efforts not in vain. (To report your joining, please contact the branch near you (contact the party headquarters in each district).</p>

<p>Cancellation of Deposit: Users of the telephone bureau who use long-distance telephones are required to register and pay a deposit of 10 yuan in advance in accordance with the regulations of the telephone bureau. It is now learned that in order to facilitate users and promote business, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to cancel the method of paying the long-distance telephone deposit in advance. The Ministry of Communications also stipulates that users who want to connect to long-distance telephones should fill out an application form when applying to the bureau. After receiving the order, the bureau has notified all users to check and notify the Shanghai Telephone Company to discuss the handling.</p>
<p>Expansion of Pole Lines: Since the Longhua Telephone Branch of the bureau was renovated with automatic telephone switchboards last year, the number of users has increased dramatically, especially in the western Shanghai area outside the business area of the branch. In view of this, the telephone bureau has expanded the outer pole lines to the vicinity of Zhongshan Road to cope with the situation. The work has been going on for more than a month and has recently been completed. Yesterday, Mr. Yu Bingjian, the chief engineer of the bureau, personally visited to start installing users' telephone sets. At the same time, the original north-south relay pole lines of the bureau along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway have been in disrepair for many years and urgently need to be repaired, and construction will also begin.</p>
<p>Installation of Cables: The Central District Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and its internal automatic switchboard have been installed long ago. Later, due to the fact that many external line materials have not arrived, it has been waiting. The reporter of the New Voice News Agency met Mr. Yu Bingjian, the chief engineer of the bureau, yesterday. According to him, the underground cable and cement pipeline project in the district will start construction today and will be completed in about five or six months. At the same time, it is planned to renovate the old pole lines in order to ensure that the telephone service is smooth when the automatic switchboard is opened.</p>

<h3>Tangkou Woman Abduction and Sale Case</h3>
<p>Hou Axiang Sentenced to One Year, Suspended for Two Years</p>
<p>Zhou Genhai, a villager from Suzhou, is 29 years old this year. He lives by farming. He married a Tangkou woman, Ms. Xiang (25 years old this year). After many years of marriage, on the 14th day of the 5th lunar month of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Ms. Xiang was called out to Shanghai by her maternal uncle under the pretext of helping. She was immediately sold to others by a colluding party. Zhou was completely unaware of this in the countryside and repeatedly asked his wife's family about her whereabouts, but it was difficult to get any accurate information. It was not until the end of last year that he learned that Ms. Xiang was communicating with her parents and finally asked someone to find her. He then learned that Ms. Xiang had been sold to Hou Axiang, also known as Jinwen, who opened a teahouse in Chenhang Town, Nanxiang, as his wife, for a price of 120 yuan. He then went with his elder brother to find her and reported it to the local Public Security Bureau. Because the incident occurred in the French Concession, Zhou came to Shanghai and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District, accusing Hou Axiang and Zhou Xiang of disrupting the family and requesting investigation, with an incidental civil lawsuit seeking to recover the 120 yuan in search losses. The court accepted the lawsuit and Judge Li Changnian and Prosecutor Wang Ren held a hearing a few days ago. Hou Axiang confessed that he was introduced by his fellow villager Zhu Jintang who said that Ms. Xiang's husband was dead, so he dared to buy her. Ms. Xiang confessed that she was sold to Hou Axiang by her husband's elder brother Zhou Yinbao. It has been less than two years since. She now does not want to go home with her husband, fearing that she will be sold again. The court verified the confessions and announced the conclusion, ordering a scheduled sentencing. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday was the date of the judgment. The plaintiff arrived on time to wait for instructions, but the defendants did not arrive. Judge Li presided over the Fourth Criminal Court and sentenced Hou Axiang to one year of imprisonment with a two-year suspension for intending to marry a woman.</p>

<h3>Dr. Chen Su's Achievements</h3>
<p>Zheng Jun Baode, the nephew of Mr. Zheng Hongnian, studied diligently at Guanghua University. In the early summer of the year before last, he suddenly suffered from lung itching and coughing, which gradually led to blood in his sputum, palpitations, insomnia, night sweats, nocturnal emissions, tinnitus, blurred vision, loss of appetite, and muscle wasting. Initially, traditional Chinese medicine was ineffective, followed by Western medicine, and he was even admitted to a sanatorium for lung examinations. All said that his tuberculosis had reached the third stage and was incurable. Zheng's relatives and friends were all deeply worried and anxious. A relative, Mr. Li, recommended Dr. Chen Susheng of Shangxianfang, Xiafei Road, to visit him, saying that this disease was due to latent pathogenic factors rather than pulmonary tuberculosis and that ephedra should be used for treatment. His family thought that the patient was very weak and feared that sweating would hasten his exhaustion. They were also hesitant to take the medicine because Dr. Chen was young and his prescription was unique. Dr. Chen said, "Great fullness has the appearance of emptiness. How can there be a dry cough without seeing stagnation and a cough that is not relieved? Try taking it." Sure enough, after one dose, the night sweats stopped, and after the second dose, the bleeding stopped, and all signs of weakness disappeared. The ephedra was increased to one qian and five fen, supplemented with ginger, cassia, and asarum for eight doses, and the chronic illness was immediately cured. Recently, Zheng Jun has been working at the Chongqing Central Bank, saying that he has recovered for more than a year and that the signs of weakness have never recurred. It can be seen that ephedra is very effective. However, if Dr. Chen had not directly explored the source of the disease and used it skillfully, how could it have been so effective? In recent years, Dr. Chen has cured many rare and difficult cases and has already gained a reputation as a rising famous doctor. This is certainly not false praise.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Mental Hospital Relocated</h3>
<p>Gu Wenjun of Chuansha, based on the secret recipes for treating madness passed down by his ancestors for seven generations, and out of compassion for those suffering from madness, opened a specialized hospital for mental illness in Ren'an Lane, Guling Road. Since its opening, it has cured no fewer than two hundred and several dozen men and women with madness, earning an outstanding reputation and word-of-mouth praise. Subsequently, last summer, he added a branch in Chunjiang Villa on Kangnaiduo Road to expand medical services and facilitate patients. The premises there consisted of six Western-style three-story buildings, with more than sixty rooms converted into wards. The location was quiet, with ample air, making it very suitable for recuperating patients. Director Gu recently found that the two hospitals were too far apart, making it difficult to provide care. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, he moved the main hospital in Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, to merge with the branch in Chunjiang Villa, which is more convenient for patient care. Gu has lost a considerable amount of money on the hospital for two years, only seeking to benefit the patients, without considering anything else. His enthusiasm for medical work is truly commendable.</p>

<h3>Vocational Education Society Agricultural Study Group Organizes National Inspection Team, Departing on the 8th</h3>
<p>First Inspecting Six Provinces Including Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan</p>
<p>Ministry of Interior Affairs Specially Issues Inspection Passports</p>
<p>The National Rural Inspection Team, initiated and organized by five members of the Agricultural Study Group of the China Vocational Education Society, including Xiang Shang, Wang Benren, Li Tao, Zhong Tianshi, and Yao Huizi, has been approved by the Ministry of Interior Affairs for the issuance of passports and is scheduled to depart on foot from Shanghai on August 8th of this month. The details of its organization are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Motivation for Inspection: Although the members of the team have gained some experience in serving rural areas, they do not dare to be completely convinced of the propositions they hold. Researchers do not leave their desks and books, and the experiments they conduct are only within a few dozen or hundred miles. Whether all the theories are applicable to provinces and counties across the country, and whether the methods adopted are feasible in various rural areas, given the vastness of the country's territory and the complexity of the environment, there is a need for exploration and inspection in many aspects. Therefore, the National Rural Inspection Team was organized to conduct in-depth on-site inspections of rural areas in the country for a considerable period, hoping to gain an accurate understanding, which would serve as a standard for the team members to serve rural areas and provide a reference for comrades serving rural areas across the country.</p>
<p>Purpose of This Trip: The greatest purposes of this nationwide rural inspection undertaken by the team despite hardships and dangers are: (1) To truly understand the rural conditions across the country, as well as the county administration facilities, in order to gain a practical concept and provide a reference for rural movement activists across the country. (2) To understand the real living conditions of farmers across the country, paying particular attention to the farmers' economy and the status of income and expenditure throughout the year, as a common basis for improving farmers' livelihoods. (3) To inspect the characteristics of various ethnic groups across the country and seek the reasons for their historical disputes, in order to awaken the attention of the people.</p>
<p>Source of Funding: The team's funding for this trip comes from: (1) Membership fees paid by members, 300 yuan per person, one-third of which is set aside as a reserve fund. This amount will not be easily used unless it is possible to find a way. The funds are entrusted to the China Vocational Education Society to be stored in the bank. (2) Manuscript fees: All materials and records obtained by the team will be published separately by the team. The manuscript fees earned will be used to cover the team's expenses, and the copyright will still be retained. Expenditure will be made under the principle of extreme savings. The planned items for expenditure include meals, accommodation, transportation, postal services, photography, stationery, medicine, and others.</p>
<p>Planned Route: The team's inspection route was originally planned for a full circle around the country. However, due to funding constraints, this may be difficult to achieve. It is temporarily divided into five stages. The first stage is from Shanghai via Xiamen, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Wuzhou, Nanning, Baise, Nanlong, Kunming, and Xuanwei to Chengdu. The second stage is from Chengdu westward via Ya'an, Kangding, also An, Changdu, Taizhao, Lhasa Saga, to Ge Taike. The third stage...The fourth stage is from Ge Dake northward via Laiji Chiling, Luoduoke City, Zhugang, Teyu Wen and Hotan Shache Shule, Bachu, Aksu, Yining, Yili Jinghe, Wusu, Dihua, Qitai to Hami. Eastward via Kushui, Xingxingxia, Anxi, Jiuquan, Zhangye, Wuwei, Gaolan, Jingyuan, Zhongwei Ningxia, Wuyuan, Baotou to Guihuan. The fifth stage is from Guihuan via Beiping Qingdao back to Shanghai. The first stage of inspection is scheduled to be completed in ten months.</p>
<p>Inspection Objects: The team's inspection objects are rural economics, culture, politics, and other undertakings in various provinces. They will visit as much as possible within their reach. The economic aspects include agriculture, animal husbandry, special products, and handicrafts. The cultural aspects include education, religion, customs, the status of women. The political aspects include organization, security, transportation, and construction.</p>
<p>Creed and Covenant: The team's creed: (1) Solving the suffering of the farmers across the country is solving the suffering of the Chinese nation. (2) Only with a sound organization can there be a sound undertaking. (3) Improving the countryside requires practical and accurate investigation. (4) Loyalty to the organization is loyalty to the cause. The team's prohibitions: (1) No empty talk, no daydreaming, no empty action. (2) No gambling, no drunkenness, no belittling of women. (3) No violation of the will of the organization. The team's covenant: (1) Those who violate the prohibitions of the team will be punished by the team after public discussion. (2) Those who privately participate in secret societies will have their membership revoked.</p>
<h3>Academic Circles Organize "Save the Written Word Society" to Preserve Chinese Characters and Classical Chinese</h3>
<p>More Than Sixty People Listed as Initiators</p>
<p>To Be Submitted to the Party Headquarters for Record, to Be Established Soon</p>
<p>More than sixty celebrities from the academic circles of this city, including Wang Xishen, Jiang Kanghu, and Pan Gongzhan, have initiated the organization of the "Save the Written Word Society" to preserve Chinese characters and promote the use of Classical Chinese. Once approved by the Municipal Party Headquarters, the inaugural meeting will be convened. The preparations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Initiators: Including Wang Xishen, Wang Muzun, Mao Xiaocen, Jiang Kanghu, Zhu Xiangwan, Wang Jianyu, Li Zhongqian, Yao Minghui, Hu Pu'an, Hu Jichen, Ma Gongmian, Chen Yantong, Chen Yixian, Zhang Feng, Liao Shaoxian, Pan Gongzhan, Gu Shi, Jiang Jianbai, and 64 others.</p>
<p>Document Outlining the Goals of the Initiators: In the past, Yan Xizhai advocated "Four Preservations," namely, preserving people, preserving nature, preserving learning, and preserving governance. We believe that today, there is one more preservation needed, which is the preservation of the written word. Since the New Culture Movement, the effectiveness of popularizing education has not been seen, while the style of national language has deteriorated day by day, and the level of national learning has declined. Recently, there have even been advocates for abolishing Classical Chinese and even abolishing Chinese characters. We are fearful of Yi Chuan's fear of the Rong people and pledge our sincerity to serve the country through writing. At this time of survival and extinction, we must fulfill our responsibility to advocate and call for action. As long as this culture is not lost, the future is bright. We are willing to encourage each other with those who have aspirations.</p>
<p>Purpose and Work: Purpose: (1) This society is solely dedicated to preserving Chinese characters and Classical Chinese, and uniting comrades to strive forward. (2) This society recognizes phonetic notation as a symbol for recognizing characters, like the use of alphabets and fanqie, but opposes replacing Chinese characters with it. It recognizes Vernacular Chinese as a stepping stone to learning language, with the merit of enlightening and popularizing, but opposes abolishing Classical Chinese because of it. (3) This society advocates that the classics, official histories, and the works of various philosophers and schools are the highest standards of national language. (4) This society advocates that all compositions in textbooks for middle and higher schools should use Classical Chinese, and all writings should also use Classical Chinese unless there are special and necessary circumstances. Work: (1) Jointly petition the government authorities to promote the propositions of this society. (2) Present opinions to education, culture, academic, and publishing institutions in various places to arouse sympathy. (3) Contact teachers of national learning and national language in various schools to ask for their support and implementation. (4) Promote literacy campaigns, popularize Classical Chinese education, cultivate national learning teachers, advocate literary societies, and circulate literary works. (5) Edit and publish the "Save the Written Word" magazine with the following missions: (1) Seek out outstanding works and masterpieces by contemporary writers to set a trend and serve as models. (2) Select the best national language achievements from various schools to provide awards and observations. (3) Criticize and correct errors in published books and newspapers to avoid spreading misinformation and misleading future generations. (4) Publish news about the society and related news about national learning and national language.</p>
<p>Organization and Regulations: Organization: (1) Anyone who agrees with the purpose of this society may register as a member. An institution with ten members may establish a branch. A place with one hundred members may establish a sub-branch. (2) Members will not be charged any additional membership fees other than jointly maintaining local society affairs. (3) This society hopes that each member will subscribe to a copy of the society's magazine. (4) This society will hold a members' meeting in various places once a month and a joint representatives' meeting once a year. Regulations: (1) This society will not participate in any other activities except for the above items. (2) Members of this society may not participate in other activities in the name of the society or its members.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters: Regarding the request for permission to initiate the "Save the Written Word Society." We, Kanghu, etc., observe that since the New Culture Movement, the effectiveness of popularizing education has not been seen, while the style of national language has deteriorated day by day, and the level of national learning has declined. Recently, there have even been advocates for abolishing Classical Chinese and even abolishing Chinese characters. We are fearful of Yi Chuan's fear of the Rong people and pledge our sincerity to serve the country through writing. At this time of survival and extinction, we dare to fulfill our responsibility to advocate and call for action. Therefore, we are initiating the "Save the Written Word Society" solely dedicated to preserving Chinese characters and Classical Chinese. However, this matter concerns the organization of academic groups, so it should be officially submitted to your headquarters for approval, which is a matter of public convenience.</p>

<h3>Location of the 1940 World Olympics to Be Decided by Vote Today</h3>
<p>Rome Has Agreed to Hold It in Japan</p>
<p>However, Finland Is Still in Competition</p>
<p>(Reuters, Rome, 27th) The Italian government formally announced today that it has telegraphed its Oslo Olympic representative to withdraw its request to hold the 1940 Games in Italy and agree to hold them in Japan. This issue will be decided by a vote of representatives from various countries at tomorrow's conference. Although Italy has conceded to Japan, Finland is still in competition. According to the Finnish representative in Oslo, based on the past performance of Finnish athletes, the 1940 Games should be held in Helsinki.</p>
<p>(Japan Federation News Agency, Rome, 27th) The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement on the 27th regarding the issue of the Summer Olympic Games, clarifying the Italian government's position. According to reports, Italian committee members advocated at the Summer Olympic Committee meeting that the 12th Games should be held in Rome, etc. However, such rumors are completely different from the facts. The Italian government has already agreed to the request of the representatives of the Japanese Sports Association and expressed its agreement to hold the Games in Tokyo. However, this is not based on any political reasons.</p>
<p>(Havas, 27th, Nowei Capital) The Japanese representative to the International Olympic Committee, Ambassador to Italy Sugimura, recently gave an interview to the press, saying that the competition among Japan, Italy, and Finland for the venue of the 1940 World Games has not yet been decided. However, I will continue to work to ensure that the 1940 Games are held in Japan. The outcome is unknown. Italian representative Panagosa said that although the venue for the next Games cannot be determined at present, Italy has the most opportunities among the three countries in competition. In addition, Finnish representative Croges said, "Finland sincerely hopes that the next Games will be held in the Finnish capital. Finnish athletes have excellent achievements in past World Games, which are known to the world. When considering the next venue, this should also be taken into account. However, the two major countries, Japan and Italy, have expressed opposition. Whether major countries have priority, we will wait and see." According to general rumors, Italy has more hope when the International Committee votes on the next venue this Friday, but Japan is also working hard in all directions.</p>
<p>(Havas, 27th, Berlin) The current Olympic Games are scheduled to be held here next year. The German Olympic Committee has sent invitations to 55 countries, and 45 countries have expressed their acceptance. The dates have also been determined. All winter sports events are scheduled to be held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen from February 6th to February 16th next year. Other programs are scheduled to be held in Berlin from August 1st to August 16th. There will be 3,500 athletes from around the world participating in the competition.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou's Sixth Annual City-Wide Long-Distance Race</h3>
<p>Distance: 15,079 Meters</p>
<p>Time: 57 Minutes, 43.4 Seconds</p>
<p>—Also Held Martial Arts Competition—</p>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondence) The annual Guangzhou Sixth City-Wide Long-Distance Race was held on February 23rd. That day, the public sports ground in the eastern suburbs was packed with crowds. The organizers had set up checkpoints along the route in advance, with over two thousand military police and city Boy Scouts maintaining order at each station. When the athletes passed, traffic was temporarily stopped, and inspectors at each station checked whether the athletes were following the rules. The arrangements were extremely tight. On the day, 224 men and 21 women participated in the race. They gathered at the public sports ground, and at noon, the starter fired the starting gun. At the sound of the gun, the male and female athletes surged forward like ten thousand horses galloping. First, they ran three laps around the track inside the ground, then along Dadong Road, Huiai Road, Fengning Road, Longjin Road, Baohua Road, Datong Road, 623 Road, Xidi, Taiping South Road, Yide Road, Taikang Road, Yuexiu Road, Baiyun Road, and Dongchuan Road. The Public Security Bureau's inspection vehicle led the way, and a Red Cross vehicle followed behind to provide medical support. Those who fainted or encountered accidents along the way were helped onto the vehicle to rest. All the streets along the route were packed with people cheering and encouraging the athletes. The scene was extremely lively. When they exited Dadong Road, the athletes were neck and neck, each refusing to give way. Twenty minutes later, when they reached Longjin East Road, the situation changed slightly. Lu Futing took the lead, followed by Liao Ming, Chen Debiao, Liu Biao, and Chen Hansheng. When they reached 623 Road, Chen Debiao suddenly moved to the front. Liu Biao took the lead at Yide Road. By this time, two-thirds of the race was over, and the differences between the runners gradually became apparent. Chen Hansheng, who had been in seventh or eighth place for a long time, surged forward, overtaking Liu Biao and taking the lead. After that, he had a smooth run, and no one surpassed him. The others gradually ran out of steam, but Liu Biao still closely followed him. When they turned back to Dadong Road and entered the public sports ground, they ran another lap around the track. Chen Hansheng won the championship, completing the 15,079-meter long-distance race in 57 minutes and 43.4 seconds. The second place was Liu Biao, with a time of 57 minutes and 53 seconds. The third place was Xu Guoping, followed by Liao Ming, Li Deqing, Chen Debiao, Chen Ji, Lu Futing, Huang Hairu, Chen Guoqing, and others. More than twenty minutes later, the women also reached the finish line one after another. Dang Yuegui won the women's championship with a time of 81 minutes and 30 seconds. The second place was Chen Qixia, with a time of 82 minutes. The third place was Li Yunqing, followed by Situ Lingcui, Jiang Xiuyun, Lu Baoqin, Tang Daoqing, Liang Meiling, and others.</p>
<p>On the same day, in addition to the Sixth City-Wide Long-Distance Race, the public sports ground also held the First National Martial Arts Performance Competition.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Miaoshen)</p>
<p>The street sweepers hired by the Suzhou Public Security Bureau earn only five or six yuan per month. After deducting food expenses, they actually only receive a few jiao per month. Moreover, they have to provide their own sweeping tools such as brooms.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, while waiting for a streetcar in front of the New World, there were five or six villagers prostrating themselves on the steps, looking very distressed. Upon inquiry, they said they had come from Haimen to escape the famine. They had more than ten mu of land at home, which should have been enough to provide for them, but last year's drought caused a disaster, and the fields yielded no grain. They had no reserves of grain at home, so how could they survive three meals a day? They had no choice but to come to Shanghai to look for relatives and friends. As they spoke, they couldn't help but sigh and lament.</p>
<p>The bandit areas of Jiangxi are desolate, and the people are wandering and displaced, finding it difficult to get even one full meal a day. Selling children and wives is a common occurrence, and the price of a person is only one yuan per year.</p>
<p>Someone sent a young woman to a pawnshop in Tangshan as collateral. The pawnshop actually treated the woman as merchandise, agreeing to the request and creating a strange story in the pawnbroking world.</p>
<h3>The Decline of Domestic Paper</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Recently, the calls to promote domestic goods have been soaring like rockets. Last year was officially designated as the Women's Domestic Goods Year, and this year has been decided as the Students' Domestic Goods Year. Everyone is putting in their full effort to find a way for domestic goods to survive, which is naturally admirable. As for the major newspapers, in addition to publishing special domestic goods weekly supplements, they are also making every effort to publish surveys and statistics on domestic goods, which is certainly a very valuable thing.</p>
<p>However, I always feel that while the calls to promote domestic goods are so high-pitched, the decline of domestic paper is also showing a significant trend. The reason for this is that many writers prefer to use foreign newspapers and foreign woodfree paper to write their articles. I feel that the most contradictory thing is to use a Parker fountain pen and foreign woodfree paper to write articles promoting domestic goods. On the one hand, they are advising people to use domestic goods, but on the other hand, they are acting as salesmen for foreign goods. Isn't that a ridiculous thing?</p>
<p>Sha Jun, in this column, said before, "Chinese brushes have reached a point of decline, and tens of millions of brush workers will face the worry of freezing and starvation." That is indeed true. But if brushes are like this, how can domestic paper not be like this? Everyone likes to use foreign paper to write things, and domestic paper has really reached a point of decline. Similarly, many workers who rely on domestic paper mills for a living, as well as their fathers, brothers, wives, and children, are not also in danger of losing their jobs and freezing and starving?</p>
<p>I very much hope that everyone will not overlook these small things from now on. The ancients said, "Do not refrain from doing good because it is small." If everyone starts doing small good deeds, it will become a great good. They also said, "Do not do evil because it is small." If everyone harbors this thought, it will become a great evil. We should also view the promotion of domestic brushes and paper in this way.</p>
<h3>Three Gatherings of Elders in Yangcheng</h3>
<p>— Wangyun</p>
<p>In this era of respecting the elderly, the Guangzhou Municipal Government held gatherings for the elderly, one after another, winning over these few ancient relics who enjoy great longevity, who laughed incessantly, as lively as crabs. Fortunately, they all had no teeth, otherwise their teeth would have been laughed off. February 15, 1935, was the third day for the old men and women to show off, with about three hundred people participating in the municipal government auditorium. Mayor Liu Jiwen and bureau chiefs and staff were responsible for all the hospitality, and about fifty or sixty tables of wine and delicacies were prepared. Everyone present had white hair. Numbers were affixed to the top of each walking stick so that they could be claimed by matching the numbers after the gathering. This bundle of canes gathered in one place looked like a sugarcane stall.</p>
<p>Sitting in the middle seat was Zhang Su, 107 years old, the oldest, and Huang Wei, 101 years old. Mayor Liu and his wife, Xu Shuzhen, diligently offered wine, and the city's band repeatedly played music. Mai Ning, a representative of Zhang Su, took to the podium and gave a brief speech of thanks, praising the virtues of the provincial and municipal authorities, Commander-in-Chief Chen, Chairman Lin, and Mayor Liu, as well as their great care for the elderly. The dishes that day were all soft, cooked to perfection, and suitable for people without teeth. After the banquet, the elderly Jian Eryun personally wrote the four characters "Jin Shi Sheng Ping" (Prosperous Market and Peaceful Times). The strokes were vigorous and powerful, a gift for Mayor Liu. I think these four characters are not good enough; it would be best to write "Mei Chi Bu Wang" (Unforgettable Even Without Teeth), expressing the idea that those without teeth do not forget great virtue. That would be more appropriate.</p>
<h3>The Precondition of Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Author: Shiying</p>
<h3>Piggy Bank</h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>Although I am not a child, I have the temper of a child; indeed, my actions are too much like a child.</p>
<p>Because my life is too casual, I am often in danger of spending more than I earn. Once I have money in hand, I spend it arbitrarily, unwilling to save it, and not even thinking about the pain of having no money. Eating, playing, and dressing, I don't skimp on anything, letting the money earned with sweat and blood slip out of my hands. When my pockets are empty, I have to borrow money from friends, ask relatives for loans, and even pawn my clothes. This goes on year after year, so I am always desperately anxious every time the holidays and the end of the year approach, unable to cope. I lose credit with friends, and relatives give me the cold shoulder. But although I have to suffer one or two major embarrassments every year, I never change my old habits, never repent, and still go my own way, living from day to day.</p>
<p>Since last year, I suddenly had a not-so-light burden of life on my shoulders, and because of the economic downturn, money is hard to find. And I haven't forgotten the taste of being homeless after being unemployed the year before. Therefore, I realized that money is not easy to come by, and I should be extra careful in spending it, so I made a resolution to find a way to save some change to prepare for unexpected needs. One day, I went to a pottery shop and bought three yellow clay piggy banks. Whenever I came across a dime, I would put it in. Sometimes when I wanted to go to a movie or buy snacks, I wouldn't go or eat, and put the money in the piggy bank. There were also a few times when I put the bus fare that I saved into it. By the end of last year, I solemnly broke the three piggy banks and got more than six hundred dimes, totaling more than one hundred dollars. So I not only got through the year safely, but also ended up with some money in my pocket. This money was all saved from daily expenses.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Unable to Flatter, He is Reprimanded When Seeking Help; Unable to Return, He is Misled by an Exaggerating Guest</p>
<p>Zhang Jiaifu, who was sitting next to him, couldn't help but steal a glance at Jia Duocai's appearance. These two gentlemen had nothing to say at first. Mr. Hu was someone who had not entered modern society, so he couldn't open his mouth either. As for Yueying, if this was considered a commodity transaction, then she was the commodity, and what could a commodity say? Therefore, although there were four people sitting in the room, it was silent. Zhang Jiaifu was someone without anything on his mind, and he was the first to realize this. He then said to Jia Duocai, "Hey! Brother, can't you think of a way for him?" Jia Duocai shrank his body, as if he had been startled, and that was when he truly woke up. He smiled and said, "How would I know that he and his daughter had run into trouble? Isn't that what you said? The ways I can think of are just that little bit. I don't care, there's nothing I can't say, but they might be embarrassed if it's said in front of them." He said it vaguely, and Mr. Hu didn't understand what he was saying at all, only staring with wide eyes. Yueying understood what he meant, but still didn't find it convenient to interrupt. Zhang Jiaifu saw that there were ready-made cigarettes and matches on the table, so he lit one, and after puffing out two clouds of thick smoke, he smiled and said, "I already know what you mean. Actually, you've already talked about it once face-to-face, so there's no harm in saying it clearly." As he spoke, he squinted his eyes and looked at both Jia Duocai and Yueying. Jia Duocai also lit a cigarette, smiling slightly, and Yueying lowered her head and fiddled with her clothes. Mr. Hu could only stare at people with wide eyes. Jiaifu smiled and said to Mr. Hu, "Sister-in-law, you probably don't understand. Your original intention was to find someone to marry your daughter, right?" Mr. Hu said, "Yes! I've been saying it for several days, but it hasn't worked out. We are borrowing a place to live with poor relatives, how can we wait?" The two Master Chen were kind enough to advise us not to give our daughter to someone as a concubine, and to find a job for us instead."</p>
<h3>Glimpses of the Imperial Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager's attitude was also completely different from when we came! She just sat quietly, rarely speaking, and forbade each of us from sticking our heads out to look at the back, supposedly because it was inauspicious. Of course, she herself was especially strict in observing this. Even in the carriage, she was very careful, never allowing her face to face the back. But I couldn't help but secretly suspect, could she restrain her own thoughts, and no longer think back to the situation in Fengtian? That was probably impossible!</p>
<p>What was the situation in Fengtian now? As I recalled, it was of course back to the way it was before the Empress Dowager left. Those elaborately dressed officials would inevitably disperse, each returning to their own yamen, busy with their daily private affairs; and those relics of Qianlong, Xianfeng, and Tongzhi would continue to lie quietly in their glass cases, locked away from people, and, along with the gloomy and desolate ancient palace, would be extinguished within a considerable period of time. Even if the Empress Dowager thought of them, she would never be able to see them again!</p>
<p>The wheels kept turning, and the scenery outside the window kept receding. Although we didn't know where we had arrived at the moment, or where we had passed by later, when we approached Shanhaiguan, we were alerted by the sight of the towering Great Wall in the distance! Gradually, this yellow train drove through the gap in the Great Wall and into the pass. The gate of this pass was clearly not closed: the unwarranted fear we had previously harbored was suddenly dispelled, and everyone unconsciously let go of a heavy stone in their hearts. They firmly believed that once this important pass was crossed, they would not be unable to return to Beijing. (256)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>
<h3>Plum Blossom Dictionary</h3>
<p>— Jiezi</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Island: West Lake is a famous scenic spot in the southeast, renowned throughout the world. The ancient sites and scenic areas in the lake are too numerous to count. Between the inner and outer lakes, an island rises, surrounded by clear waves and verdant water. It is a natural beauty. It was originally named Yingyu, also known as Guyu, and some call it Gushan. The entire island has many plum trees, and the cold fragrance is dense and layered, hence the name Plum Blossom Island. Lin Bu of the Song Dynasty lived in seclusion here, planting plum trees and raising cranes. He took plum blossoms as his wife and cranes as his sons, hence the saying "wife plum and son crane."</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Ridge: A famous scenic spot in Yangzhou, Jiangsu. The ridge is located outside the Guangchu Gate of Jiangdu County. During the Ming Dynasty, the scholar Wu Xiu, while serving as the prefect of Yangzhou, used river silt to build it. Plum trees covered the mountain, appreciating their solitary fragrance. After Shi Kefa died for his country, the local people buried his clothes and crown here as a memorial. Today, however, weeds seal the tomb, and the plum blossoms have withered and fallen. Other places known as Plum Ridge include the Dayu Ridge in Dayu County, Jiangxi. Because the roads on the ridge are lined with red and white plum blossoms, and looking up at the blue sky, only a line is visible, the abundance of plum blossoms can be imagined, hence the name. There are also Plum Ridges in the northeast of Ningdu County and the west of Xinjian County, but they have now been submerged and are no longer prominent.</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Mountain: Located about thirty li southeast of Lujiang County, Anhui, there is a majestic mountain. The mountain is quiet at all times, but when winter arrives, plum blossoms are everywhere, hence the name. It is said that when Wei Wuzi was traveling here, he lost his way. His three armies were thirsty and asked for a drink. Wu ordered, "There is a plum forest ahead, with abundant sweet and sour fruits that can quench your thirst." When the soldiers heard this, their mouths watered. The saying "quench thirst by thinking of plums" originates from this.</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Gate: On Dalong Mountain in Lanxi County, Zhejiang, there are plum trees on both sides of the narrow entrance to the mountain. Every winter, the red and white flowers bloom, intersecting to form a gate shape, a natural scenic spot. Overlooking the Da Mei Creek, the locals named the place after it. Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty defeated the Yuan here, conquering Wuzhou. A Plum Blossom Eulogy stele was erected, but it has long been abandoned and no longer exists.</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Cottage: About five li north of Tongshan County in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, there is Jiuyi Mountain, commonly known as Jiuli Mountain. During the Ming Dynasty, Wang Yuanzhang (named Mian), a talented man from Zhuji, Zhejiang, was known for his plum blossom paintings. In his later years, he came to live in seclusion on the mountain, building a thatched cottage of three rooms halfway up the mountain, reclaiming ten mu of land and planting a thousand plum trees. The plum blossoms surrounded the cottage, and he named his residence Plum Blossom Cottage, also known as the Master of Plum Blossom Cottage.</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Makeup: During the Song Dynasty, Princess Shouyang, daughter of Emperor Wu, was sleeping under the eaves of the palace on Renri (the seventh day of the first month), and plum blossoms fell on her forehead, forming five-petaled flowers, greatly increasing her beauty. Later, the name Plum Blossom Makeup came into being, also said to be Shouyang Makeup. Today, women cover their foreheads with hair to make bangs, which actually originated from this.</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Fall: The name of a horizontal flute piece from the Han Dynasty, originally a melody in the flute. According to the Tang Dynasty Dajiao Music, there are also distinctions between Da Shanyu, Xiao Shanyu, Da Meihua, and Xiao Meihua. Today, its sound is still like spring, which is Meihua Sannong.</p>

<p>Gold Standard Fluctuates</p>
<p>Public Bonds Already Redeemed Ninety-Nine Percent</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Hardens, Weakens Mid-Way</p>
<p>Buying Activity Rises by 1.8 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw Western and Reuters dispatches reporting that Minister of Finance Kong and Mr. Song Ziwen were summoned by Chairman Chiang to Wuhan to discuss financial matters. Public sentiment was speculative, and the situation strengthened slightly. However, the exchange rate remained hard, repeatedly declining mid-way. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both England and America rose, the "big feet" (major players) were also firm, and forward silver prices also increased. Exchange rates slightly contracted. London spot gold rose by five pence, causing continued weariness in public sentiment. Off-market pre-market trading opened and then retreated to 71.12 yuan. The North China Daily News carried news of the meeting between Minister of Finance Kong and Mr. Song Ziwen in Hankou. Major players took advantage of low prices to buy, and retail investors followed suit, creating an upward trend. The Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with both British and American currencies rising, and customs gold units falling by seven li. The gold standard price was lowered to 930.1 yuan, a slight rebound, but the opening was still high. After the opening, the market fluctuated, hovering around 80 yuan. Public sentiment was optimistic, and Chinese merchants tried to push down the foreign exchange rate, gradually increasing it. However, because banks took advantage of the high price to sell, the price suddenly fell after reaching a high point. The psychology of supply and demand diverged, and the market situation was extremely unstable. The HSBC announced its exchange rates, which remained unchanged. Afterwards, buying interest revived, and the price rose again. Sassoon sold shillings, and the upward trend was again frustrated. After entering the market, banks continuously sold, and the exchange market gradually hardened. Sellers then became active from time to time. Despite some struggles mid-way, the overall momentum lacked strength, and it retreated into the 80 yuan range. At noon, a stalemate appeared. The afternoon market opened steadily. Then, due to the small report of silver coins being printed, and the Reuters dispatch stating that Minister of Finance Kong and Mr. Song Ziwen were summoned by Chairman Chiang to Hankou to discuss financial matters, public sentiment became speculative again, and an upward trend was seen. However, the banks continued to sell, and major players engaged in some profit-taking, retreating into the 80 yuan range. At this time, there was much fluctuation. Later, rumors spread that the Central Bank was shipping over 5,600 bars of cash to England, but the rumor that they lacked the appetite to open cash transactions caused public sentiment to suddenly become weary, and many parties came to cut losses, gradually falling back. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to buy, and buyers became active when prices were low, and then rose again. After the close, the price even rose to above 80 yuan. Cash delivery will begin today.</p>

Shengda Heng Changyong, although they bought, were all supplied by Yifeng Yong Qian Changxiang, and retreated into the 80 yuan range. After this, transactions were mediocre, retail investors came in and out from time to time, and the market situation hovered, once retreating to 8.3 yuan. The noon closing was 879.1 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 879.1 yuan. Yongli first entered, rising immediately to 81.1 yuan. Fuxing Yong Hongkangyong sold off, falling to 79.7 yuan. The report of silver coins being printed was small at 3.6.3 anna. Yingxiang Qian Changyong Lichang Da Hengyu and others bought one after another. Reuters reported that Minister Kong and Song Ziwen were summoned by Chairman Chiang to Hankou to discuss the restoration of financial affairs, and the price rose to 82.5 yuan.

McAlister still sold April US dollars at 1875. Although Yuan Changyong bought, Dalian Gang Dadecheng Dafa Yong Fuyu sold to 0.05 yuan. Hengyu still bought, rising to 1.6 yuan. The small increase in the report of silver coins being printed at 1.4.4 anna had little impact. After entering the market, Datong came out with April US dollars at 25. Dadecheng Fuchang Yongli Hengyu Dafa Yong Jinlong and others sold off one after another, gradually falling to 75.8 yuan. Huixiang Yuanyi Yongli and others still came to maintain, and at this time there were repeated rebounds to outside 7 yuan, but the rumor that the central government was shipping cash for export to purchase spot silver was repeated, and the buying appetite was stagnant. Wan Changyong Hengyu Jinlong Qian Changxiang Da Changxiang sold off one after another, and fell to 4.2 yuan. Yicheng Yifeng Yong Dafa Yong Hengyu Fuxing Yong and others came to buy. McAlister bought April US dollars at 375, and gradually rebounded. The closing price was 878.1 yuan. After the close, Yuan Da Dadecheng Fuyu Yiyu and others came to buy, and once rose to 81 yuan. Dalian Gang Yuan Maoyong took advantage of the high price to sell off, and stabilized. Checking the highest price of the day was 886 yuan, and the lowest price was 874.2 yuan, a total of 11.8 yuan in ups and downs. As a result, it rose 1.8 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>As a result, the Central Bank's standard gold price retreated to 930.1 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 52 yuan lower, which was more than 5 yuan less than the previous closing. March registration was 873 yuan, April was 879 yuan. Morning water capture was 861 yuan, afternoon water capture was 860 yuan. The price of pure gold was about 5 yuan more, at 883.5 yuan.

This was because the Central Bank's appetite suddenly stagnated, and since cash had to be collected today, many parties were panicked. For March bars, only 56 companies were left in addition to public bonds.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. In summary, Hengyu Dafa Yong Huixiang Shunli Da Changxiang Yuan Maoyong Jiarun Fuxing Yong Yuanyi Yuqing Yong Yuan Changyong and others were on the buying side, while Dadecheng Yifeng Yong Qian Changxiang Yiyu Ruixing Hanheng Fuchang Hongxing Tianfeng Fuyu Huixiang Heng Changyong and others were on the selling side.

After the opening, rumors spread that there were benefits, and the Chinese merchants' sentiment was tight. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates were announced, with the British pound rising by 0.125, and the US dollar rising by 0.1875. The customs gold unit fell by 7 li, but it did not have much impact. The Chinese merchants bought, and then became tight.

Sassoon also sold shillings, and the banks followed suit, and the process gradually hardened. Chinese merchants and others bought and sold unevenly. Jewish merchants Qiao Zhibu and the Central Bank also sold. At noon, the trend seemed to loosen. The afternoon market opened with a small report of silver coins being printed and a Reuters dispatch saying that Minister Kong and others arrived in Hankou at the invitation of Chairman Chiang to discuss financial matters. The Chinese merchants' sentiment was still firm and they were able to maintain it. However, the banks continued to sell. After entering the market, rumors spread that the central government was shipping cash for export to purchase spot silver, and the process became hard. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to replenish, and finally stabilized.

<p>Call Loan Rates Slightly Sluggish, Settlements Proceed Smoothly</p>
<p>Due to the small number of positions in the foreign market recently, each company has maintained a cautious attitude, resulting in a lack of willingness for easy interaction in the market, leading to a sluggish atmosphere. Yesterday was the end of the month settlement period, but aside from the smoother settlement, there was no improvement in other aspects. Affected by the sluggishness, the call loan rate was reduced by one cent from the previous day, with both the morning and afternoon markets at eight cents. The head was added and the market was divided into two points. Call loan transactions amounted to over 2.2 million in the morning and over 400,000 in new transactions.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Major Players Gradually Enter, Bond Market Rises Consistently</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market was firm in the morning and suddenly rose sharply in the afternoon. The market atmosphere was poised for either advance or retreat, but after this boost, public sentiment strengthened sharply. Major players gradually entered, with a particular focus on purchasing 23 Customs bonds, and the market appeared tense. There were also signs of significant fluctuations. If the rumors became reality, there was a possibility of continued upward trends in the future. In terms of finance, the government was determined to maintain stability. In terms of diplomacy, Sino-Japanese relations had clearly improved. With a stable environment, even the slightest movement by the short sellers would lead to higher prices, which was to be expected. Yesterday's experience, both morning sessions, showed signs of circling with firmness. All parties had some sporadic buying, and major players also had more buying than selling. April transactions were relatively active, and 23 Customs bonds also gradually recovered, rising by 0.45 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon opening, the military reduction rose sharply by 0.45 yuan, and the rest also rose by 0.2 to 0.5 yuan. The 23 Customs bonds had a surge at the beginning of the month, but were suppressed by the 4th number and failed to fulfill their wishes. Forward 46 Customs bonds had a lot of buying, continuing to rise by 0.45 yuan, with an excellent situation. The closing transactions were clear, and the market was flat, with slight differences. The 23 Customs bonds continued to be firm by 0.2 yuan. In summary, the market price results showed a consistent upward trend, ranging from 0.2 to 0.75 yuan. The total transaction amount was 9,365,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in comparison on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>Baby Bonds About to Be Issued, US Bond Market Uniquely Declines</p>
<p>New Finance Bank reported that yesterday (27th), the New York stock market saw a slight, uneven increase after the short selling of industrial stocks stopped. Railroad stocks were stronger than before because the Financial Construction Corporation announced that its lending policy would not change. Furthermore, according to New Haven Railroad Manager Paar Demer, the road did not want to consider reorganization again, so public sentiment also stabilized. Public utility stocks were also firmer than before, with New York Gas being the best. According to reports, the New York Gas Company has admitted that the prices in New York City are too high and there is an intention to reduce them. If so, the establishment of municipal power plants may not be realized. Due to the rise in silver prices, the purchase of silver stocks also increased. The copper stock market situation improved, as it was heard that foreign producers had agreed to meet in New York next week to discuss reducing production outside the United States. Apart from railroad bonds, the bond market was uneven and soft. US government bonds were declining because "Baby" bonds were about to be issued. Small exchange stocks did not fluctuate much. The total number of transactions for the day was 930,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Recent Strong Rebound in Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>After a sharp drop, the cotton yarn market has been continuing its rebound. Recently, the upward momentum has been exceptionally strong. There are rumors in the market of a well-organized bull company, leading to short covering by speculators and further firming of the market. In the afternoon, news spread that Mr. Xu had purchased 3,000 bales of 20-count "Fortune" yarn from the Hengfeng factory, causing much discussion in the market. If this transaction is confirmed, it will have a significant impact on the price of standard yarn.</p>
<p>Shanghai Yarn Exchange Sees Short Covering; Standard Yarn Prices Rise</p>
<p>The opening of the futures market saw an immediate surge in prices for near-month contracts, fueled by rumors of a bull company organizing to buy up standard yarn. As a result, speculators covered their short positions, leading to a sharp rise in prices. At the same time, spot yarn sales remained strong. Consequently, prices for all months rose by 1.6, 1.7, or 1.9 yuan. The upward momentum continued at the afternoon opening, but the market stabilized somewhat after rumors that Mr. Xu had purchased 3,000 bales of 20-count "Fortune" yarn from the factory, ostensibly for delivery against the standard. As a result, the current month contract remained unchanged, while prices for distant months rose by 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 yuan. Sales were as follows: Yuda 1,050 bales, Dafu 1,750 bales, Yuanda 1,000 bales, Daji 900 bales, Zhenda 1,450 bales, Hexing 2,750 bales, Gengfeng 1,000 bales, Hengde 1,400 bales, Junchang 850 bales. Purchases were as follows: Dafeng 1,400 bales, Xinchang 1,300 bales, Yuanyi 3,650 bales, Changfeng 3,250 bales, Dachang 1,000 bales, Runkang 1,350 bales, Junchang 950 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Active Spot Yarn Trading of 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain good. Including the transactions from the previous day, a total of 1,925 bales were traded, with prices rising by 5 jiao. Purchases by various groups were as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Market Remains Weak</p>
<p>The cotton market has been weak since its initial rise. Cotton inventories in Shanghai continue to grow. Due to the sluggish yarn market, factories that had reduced or halted production have yet to resume operations. This has reduced demand for raw cotton. Furthermore, overseas cotton prices are becoming more competitive due to the effects of extended exchange rates. As a result, the cotton market appears weak.</p>
<p>Selling Spree Follows Rise in Zheng Standard Cotton</p>
<p>The opening of the futures market for standard cotton saw a slight increase due to the slight rise in American cotton prices and the continued decline in Indian cotton prices, as well as the upward trend in the yarn market. However, Shanghai's cotton inventory is still above 1 million dan, and factory shutdowns have reduced raw cotton consumption. Therefore, there was more enthusiastic selling during the price rise. Consequently, prices for all months rose by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The situation tightened further at the afternoon opening. General opinion is that prices have already fallen 3 yuan from their peak, and it is possible that they will rebound by 1 yuan before another shift occurs. However, the overall situation remains soft. But by the closing bell, prices had fallen again due to the decline in gold prices, resulting in a decrease of 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Sales were as follows: Changhe 14,500 dan, Dafeng 2,900 dan, Hexing 3,500 dan, Runkang 8,000 dan, Yikang 1,500 dan, Hengde 1,400 dan, Zhenda 3,200 dan, Yuanda 3,300 dan, Suilong 2,100 dan, Dafu 2,100 dan, Jifeng 2,600 dan. Purchases were as follows: Dafu 2,000 dan, Jifeng 3,500 dan, Tongji 1,600 dan, Mingde 1,700 dan, Shenchang 3,400 dan, Changyu 1,600 dan, Yuanyi 2,600 dan, Shengyuan 2,000 dan, Yuanxingchang 5,000 dan, Suilong 2,100 dan, Jinchang 3,400 dan, Xincheng 1,900 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>No Large Demand for Raw Cotton</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is slightly active, but large-scale demand has yet to develop.</p>
<p>American Cotton Lifted by Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened flat. Near-month contracts rose by 2 points, while distant-month contracts fell by 3 points. The market situation was bleak in the morning. Although the liquidation of long positions in March futures has ended, traders remained cautious, awaiting the government's policy developments regarding new and surplus cotton. There were few new buyers and sellers. In the afternoon, wheat and stocks rose, leading to buying on Wall Street and a rebound in prices. Spot demand is sluggish, but the fundamentals remain strong. The outlook for the textile industry is bleak. According to Fanchuer, the cotton acreage for this year is estimated at 33,455,000 acres. The closing was firm, with spot prices rising 15 points and futures prices rising 2 to 11 points. The British cotton market was stable, with spot prices falling 1 point and futures prices falling 1-2 points. Indian cotton (Bai Luo Xi) was stable. Cotton farmers hedging by selling Pingguoer and Aomula. Pingguoer fell 1 rupee, Aomula fell 1.25 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi fell 0.25 rupees. The left is recorded from the original telegram. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Bai Luo Xi cotton on the 28th is 247.5 rupees, up 0.5 rupee from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>North Jiangsu White Rice Down Another 1-2 Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supply from all districts was only a little more than 20 firms, about 4,000 shi total in volume. Although the local sales were not brisk, customers from Weihaiwei, Yantai, Longkou and other districts continued to buy more than 1,000 packages. Therefore, the previously flat and weak market showed signs of stabilization, but without significant improvement. The price of Su, Tong, South Port and other japonica rice varieties did not change significantly. Although the late rice, especially the Zhongguan goods, was still in short supply by a few cents, higher-priced products were relatively stable. Other varieties such as Dujian and Yinbianyuan were soft due to limited demand.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived from the lower reaches of the river. Few customers were buying in the market. Even with price cuts, only a few transactions were made. The price of white japonica early rice fell by another 1-2 jiao, Bianyuan and thin rice were down about 1 jiao, and other grains were also down by about 1 jiao.</p>
<p>Imported Rice Continues Weak</p>
<p>Guest Xian Rice Temporarily Stabilized, Quanzhou and Jiujiang Continue Trial Purchases</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market continued to be weak due to ample inventories and continuous arrivals. However, in addition to the two local groups continuing to purchase, new groups from Jiujiang and Quanzhou also began purchasing, creating a bustling market atmosphere. However, the current financial situation is tight, and the purchasing power of various ports is inevitably affected by the economy. Many hoarders inside and outside the industry are also taking a wait-and-see attitude. In addition, continuous arrivals are expected, so high-grade imported rice continued to decline by a few cents yesterday. Medium and lower-grade rice inventories are relatively low, and the domestic market demand is eager, so prices are still able to hold. A total of 4,200 bags of Saigon rice, 800 bags of Xiaowen rice, and 3,000 bags of Siamese rice were sold. Except for nearly 1,000 bags purchased by Jiujiang and the local groups, all were purchased by domestic groups. Guest xian rice stocks are low and scarce. After the price fell the day before, merchants are unwilling to sell at a loss. Therefore, the market has stabilized. Yesterday, 850 bags of milled red rice were sold, and were divided among domestic, local, and Quanzhou groups.</p>
<p>31,000 Bags of Flour Delivered</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery day for February flour contracts. A total of 31,000 bags were delivered for the entire month. Because spot goods were very tight at the end of the month, and standards were raised, arbitrageurs were unable to continue. Therefore, some contracts were delivered, while others were transferred to out-of-town groups. Therefore, deliveries were purely for recovering capital. It is rumored that Fufeng's red and blue car brands accounted for 6,000 bags, Fuxin's green battleship brand accounted for 5,000 bags, and Xinda's green cannon platform accounted for 20,000 bags. According to industry insiders, because spot sales are currently very good, and factories have no goods to supply the market, standards and spot prices are inversely related. Therefore, factories are rumored to be considering adding 0.03 to 0.05 yuan to spot prices when March begins to cope with this difficulty.</p>
<p>February Coarse Grains Delivery Volume</p>
<p>Overseas Wheat Prices Gradually Rise</p>
<p>The delivery volume of coarse grains in February was still bustling. The actual delivery of wheat totaled 47 cars. However, because 6-7 cars were either unqualified or reclaimed by customers, the number of cars was reduced. The delivery volume of standard soybeans was 73 cars. The largest buyers were No. 9, with 45 cars, followed by No. 35, with 28 cars. A total of 7,000 pieces of soybean cake were delivered, with No. 25 delivering 5,000 pieces and No. 6 delivering 2,000 pieces. Buyers included No. 15, with 2,000 pieces, No. 17, with 4,000 pieces, and No. 22, with 1,000 pieces.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat markets are seeing excessive selling due to poor weather in the southwest. Short covering is pushing up prices.</p>
<p>Sorghum Sales Brisk, Price Up 1 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sorghum market saw a sharp rise in prices twice in one day due to the activity of the Changsha group. The morning opened with a car of Kaiyuan red husk sorghum at 4.08 yuan, followed by two cars at 0.1 yuan higher. Buying interest remained strong in the afternoon, and merchants, taking advantage of the shortage of goods, quoted 4.2 yuan, which was again purchased by the Hunan group for one car. The daily market price was 0.13 yuan higher than the previous day. Currently, Kaiyuan grain is the most sought-after because the price at the place of origin is high, transportation is not profitable, and supply is lacking. In addition, the local inventory is low. 700 bags of Kaibengbu grain were sold at 3.25 yuan and purchased by the Dongyang group from the Zhejiang-Shaoxing group at 4 yuan per car of Kaiyuan Chong red husk, and 200 bags of Guide grain were sold at 3.5 yuan, all of which were 0.03 to 0.04 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Chaoqing Continues to Open with Over 1,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended slightly stable. The association's price for No. 24 raw white sugar was quoted at 16.8 yuan, but no transactions were made. Transshipment goods were at 4.888 yuan, with 200 bags traded. The price of the local factory's refined white sugar fell again by 0.2 yuan. Zhenyu No. 1 was at 16.4 yuan, No. 2 was at 16.3 yuan, No. 3 was at 16.15 yuan, and No. 4 was at 16 yuan. Chaoqing continued to open with over 1,000 bags, with Tiqing at 10.6 yuan, Huanggangqing at 10.2-10.3 yuan, ordinary at 9.9-10 yuan, and Longqing at 9.4 yuan, with little fluctuation. All Shantou exchange telegraphic transfers have been changed. According to the reply, they only fell by 4-5 yuan, but further declines are expected. Hainan red sugar opened with another 100 bags at 10.4 yuan, a decrease of 0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods</h3>
<p>Raw Peanuts See Slight Activity in Guangdong and Shantou Markets</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Guangdong and Shantou groups continued to purchase raw peanuts. The Guangdong group purchased a car of Shandong raw peanuts at 7.15 yuan, the Shantou group purchased a car of Guide peanuts at 6.2 yuan, and two and a half cars of Dangshan peanuts at 6 yuan. The trend stabilized slightly. (The previous day's incorrect statement of a 1 yuan fall in the raw peanut market has been corrected, should be corrected to eleven yuan).</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>White Tung Oil Continues to Rise in Hankou and Foreign Firms</p>
<p>Since the conclusion of the accounts, there have been no large transactions in Hankou city foreign firms for white tung oil. Therefore, the market has been fluctuating between 30.02 and 30.03 yuan. However, in the past two or three days, Hankou has frequently telegraphed increases. As of the day before yesterday, the Hankou telegram had added up to 32 yuan. This was reported in this newspaper yesterday. Last night, local firms received another telegram from Hankou saying that foreign firms' oil has increased to 33 yuan per dan. The increase in telegraphic transfers is increasing daily, and the momentum is strong. It is also said that Hankou firms' wholesale prices for domestic sales have also increased to 18 taels. The price of Xiang tung oil may not be less than 26-27 yuan. The future market is still promising.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Black Iron Sheet Market Trend Firm</p>
<p>Although transactions by out-of-town groups for black iron sheets have not been high recently, factory sales have been good. Therefore, daily transactions are quite considerable. However, the exchange rate and the tight money supply have caused inconsistencies in quotations. For example, the price for 18-gauge black iron sheets ranged from 9.8-9.9 yuan to 10.5 yuan per bundle. However, due to low inventory and good market sentiment, there is no downward trend in quotations. However, most sellers have different intentions and are suffering from the tight money supply, resulting in forced price cuts to obtain cash. Consequently, some are quoting 9.8-9.9 yuan, while others are quoting 10.05 yuan. Therefore, it is difficult to unify the estimated price of the entire city. In addition, 3-gauge to 10-gauge black iron sheets of 3 feet by 6 feet are still priced at 9.5 yuan. It is said that only 70-80 bundles were traded, and most buyers were local factories.</p>

<h3>Reading Groups and "Salons"</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>Recently, Professor Zhu Guangqian of Peking University advocated a kind of reading group. This kind of reading group is gathering many people who study literature together, choosing a date, and everyone meeting in one place, reading each other's works, in order to achieve the effect of mutual learning. Recently, a meeting was held in Zhu Guangqian's private residence, and people such as Shen Congwen, Li Jianwu, and Zhu Ziqing all attended the meeting, and Qinghua student Lin Geng also attended, and read two of his recent poems on the spot. Although this kind of reading group is very small in scale, it cannot be considered a pioneering work in China. In France, this kind of reading group is very popular, and they call it literary salon (Salons Literaires), which is commonly translated as "salon." Many writers gather in this salon, including poets, novelists, and playwrights, and everyone reads each other's works. Therefore, in the literary world, writers can unite and study various issues together, and the atmosphere of the literary world is particularly strong. If an unknown writer has any masterpieces, he must also bring his works to the "salon" to read through, and after being praised by everyone, publishing them will surely make him famous in one fell swoop. Li Jinfang has an article "French Literary Salon" in the 18th issue of Ren Jian Shi, he said:</p>
<p>"This kind of atmosphere is very interesting and worth promoting. Contemporary writers can often meet, connect feelings, and get the benefits of mutual learning and polishing, discuss problems, give speeches, play games, and even organize political parties. New writers can also have the opportunity to meet some old predecessors, so as not to bury their talents. It is a pity that we in China do not have such hospitable and wealthy ladies to give us all the opportunity to meet, so as not to despise each other, I laugh at you, you scold me, making everyone embarrassed afterwards, building barriers. - For the sake of the present, it is best to have a literary club for writers of various schools to gather, so that in the future, various newspapers can hit fewer lawsuits with their pens. As of 1895, there were still three or four relatively large literary salons in Paris, all of which were missed by great writers.</p>
<p>It turned out that the owners of the French literary salons at that time were mostly ladies and young ladies, and I believe that this kind of thing will never happen in China.</p>
<p>The influence of this kind of literary salon on the literary world is very great. We know that in 1830, the French romanticism school defeated classicism, and the power of the "salon" was very great. Without the salon, they would not have a place to gather, their problems could not be publicly discussed, and their power could not be concentrated. The literary salon is indeed something that writers of various schools should have now. In Zeng Zhongming's "Collected Essays on French Literature," there is a section recording the situation of French writers gathering in literary salons at that time, which is very interesting, so I will now record it below:</p>
<p>"That night, starting at eight o'clock, the veterans of the romanticism school came one after another to their headquarters, the big-headed and broad-faced Dumas, the short and stout Sainte-Beuve, the round-faced Balzac, the skinny Mechemer, the gorgeously dressed Musset, the stern-looking Vieille, and more than twenty teenagers, all vying to enter. They gathered in the red living room, sitting, standing, chatting, or shouting, Mrs. Hugo was in the center of the room, and everyone greeted her. Some were wearing red half-sleeves, some were wearing long hair, some were wearing fashionable velvet clothes, and some were wearing wide black hats. After a while, Hugo began to recite his new drama, his eyes shining, at first reciting the first act, his voice was very weak, without high or low, the more he recited, the more interesting it became, and at the painful place, the sound was clear and sharp, suddenly changing to soaring, like ten thousand horses galloping, rushing to the enemy, like a hurricane and rainstorm, shaking the rocks and valleys; finally, he had finished reciting, and the aftersound lingered in the air, and the twenty or thirty people present clapped at the same time, the sound shaking the roof beams. Dumas shouted, "Good article!" Delacroix shouted, "Wonderful! Wonderful!" Those teenagers also shouted at the same time, "Amazing genius!" This passage describes the situation of French writers gathering in salons at that time, which is really enjoyable and makes people feel extremely comfortable in their hearts. At that time, French writers were able to learn from each other in this kind of interesting place, and naturally they had to add a very strong force to their team.</p>
<p>However, in the French literary circles at that time, there were often many who were perfunctory, and some did not dare to correctly criticize a writer who had already become famous. For example, when a writer who had already become famous read a very mediocre work, everyone had to pretend to be greatly moved to make him look good. In the literary salon of Mrs. Chateaubriand, everyone treated Chateaubriand in this way. One day, Mrs. Chateaubriand invited the writers of France at that time to her "salon" to listen to Chateaubriand read his new book. At this time, Chateaubriand was gradually aging, and the tragedy he wrote was mediocre and unremarkable, so the attendees all felt disappointed, but in order to respect Chateaubriand's life, everyone pretended to be very moved after the meeting. I didn't expect that this kind of hypocrisy also existed in France. I think that when China has literary salons, the first thing that should be avoided is this kind of hypocrisy. Chinese people are best at being polite, so they are often extremely hypocritical.</p>
<p>In the article, a young and beautiful writer is also most likely to fall in love with female writers in the literary salon. The French poet Lamartine was like this. He made a big splash in Mrs. Chateaubriand's literary salon. Mrs. Chateaubriand also invited him to listen to Chateaubriand's tragedy. His appearance was delicate and his behavior was elegant, so he was welcomed and loved by young women when he entered the salon. Everyone forgot Chateaubriand and focused on this beautiful poet Lamartine. Later, he met the female poet Delphine Gay, and they often went to scenic places to play, which was really intimate, but Lamartine was already married, so he could not marry her. I can't help but say that these romances were obtained because of the introduction of the salon. Dumas has a passage in his memoirs that records the situation of writers at that time who missed the "salon", which is also quite interesting. It says:</p>
<p>"Hugo often recited his new works, very energetic, and Rochejaque sometimes said to Lamartine or Hugo:</p>
<p>"I've heard enough prose, read these two poems!"</p>
<p>They either leaned against the chair with their hands, or leaned against the wall with their heads, or closed their eyes and chanted poetry, and after everyone listened, they clapped and praised, and those who could play the piano even played the piano to harmonize, until midnight, they were still unwilling to disperse.</p>
<p>I believe that doing this interesting thing is more meaningful than boring pastimes!</p>
<h3>Untitled</h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>I used to walk here,</p>
<p>The lonely bald mountain is also lonely,</p>
<p>But the distant trees still surround wisps of smoke;</p>
<p>In the loneliness, there are occasional roosters crowing loudly.</p>
<p>Now I walk here again,</p>
<p>The lonely bald mountain is still lonely,</p>
<p>But it is not only the bald mountain that is lonely,</p>
<p>Where can I see wisps of smoke, where can I hear roosters crowing?</p>
<p>I used to walk here,</p>
<p>Flocks of sparrows were startled in the sorghum field,</p>
<p>The thatch hanging on the thatched house was half new,</p>
<p>Cow dung bubbles were often seen beside the ridges.</p>
<p>Now I walk here again,</p>
<p>I can't see the sorghum field, I can't see the flocks of sparrows,</p>
<p>There is no house, but there are clusters of thatch,</p>
<p>And I can't find the ridges either.</p>
<h3>Cold Night in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>Breaking the pattern, this year's old capital is not as severely cold as in previous years. By noon, the ice on the road will melt. Although it is still a bit cold at night, the street runners rushing to the ancient New Year's customs will take off their felt hats to let the heat of their heads dissipate and say in their mouths:</p>
<p>"It's really warm, it doesn't seem like New Year's."</p>
<p>Yes, on the street, you can see some scenes of the New Year.</p>
<p>Green-clad warriors with box cannons stand at the crossroads, presumably to maintain law and order. Regardless of whether this is a "abolished Lunar New Year", the police team can only do their duty.</p>
<p>In front of the normally quiet big cake shops, glass sheds have been set up, piled with non-oily plate cakes, bee cakes padded with tofu skin, cornmeal cakes inlaid with jujubes... large plates are placed there, attracting people's attention. As soon as you bow your head to take a look, the clerk waiting beside you will happily tell you the price. The shops in Peiping have this ability to grab customers with smiles.</p>
<p>On the small tables covered with reed curtains in front of the noodle shops are lined up mountains of white steamed buns, round or tall, with small red dots on top. This is a symbol of the New Year's steamed buns. People usually only know that people in Peiping eat dumplings for the New Year, but they don't know that there are so many steamed buns waiting to be sold.</p>
<p>Red paper lanterns are hung on bamboo poles for sale, accompanied by a few lanterns painted with paper figures and paper horses, all of which are so crude, but children don't dislike them for being not refined, as long as they check whether the paper has holes and can insert small red candles, they will smile. The rows of old cannons lined up in front of the firecracker shops also tempt pairs of small eyes, who first have to ask how to tear open the paper twist and how high the fireworks can go. Naughty children would rather save the copper coins they use to buy candy and exchange them for a string of small yellow firecrackers.</p>
<p>Those who sell red paper and black character Spring Couplets stop at the same old place, and some old ladies will familiar touch them.</p>
<p>"This one is: Peace in all seasons; this one is: Look up and see joy. ..."</p>
<p>Listening to the seller's instructions, she reached into her pocket and the transaction was successful. Some middle-aged and older women love to ask for auspiciousness the most.</p>
<p>Iron shops put incense burners and candle holders in front of the door.</p>
<p>The peddlers' burdens are so full that people doubt whether he will have a day to sell them all. There are many mixed snacks peddlers, and children ask for it when they buy:</p>
<p>"Put more crabapple fruits!"</p>
<p>"I don't want sour dried apricots! I want peanut candy!"</p>
<p>The sliced cake carts seem so heavy on the side, especially delicate than usual, and the surface is covered with ginkgo, jujubes, and some who dare not go to the big cake shop to inquire will take care of it here.</p>
<p>The fruits on the peach are specially padded with new white paper, and the beautiful and fat fruits are placed on the top of each pile. Waving the chicken feather duster:</p>
<p>"One mao per pile, the fruit is beautiful and big!"</p>
<p>Their business is very fragmented, because the fruit bureau has already taken over the fruit early on.</p>
<p>People shuttle back and forth beside the candied hawthorn carts, taking strings of hawthorns, crabapples, and grapes from the shelves under the cloth sheds that support the dust. They look at which string has more sugar and which string has bigger fruits.</p>
<p>It seems that the number of cars and Zhao numbers have increased in both cars and trams, and people are busy. On the rickshaws, the passengers' feet are filled with South Fruit bags and wine bottles.</p>
<p>The debt collectors are all riding bicycles and dashing around, with white canvas pockets hanging on their shoulders. If you walk in a dark alley, this should be a tempting bait, right? Fortunately, there are not many "skinned pigs" of this kind yet.</p>
<p>Outside of these thousands and millions of smiling faces, there are also many people who cannot squeeze out a single smile.</p>
<p>They use clenched fists and sighs to curse this cold night.</p>
<p>The helpless men wander around the street corners and alleys, hoping to go home in the quiet late at night, and they hide from the debt collectors with the cloth bags.</p>
<h3>Random Chats on Historical Anecdotes (8)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>This is purely psychological description, far more delicate than Liu Yong's. I use this example to illustrate the method of embellishment: we find a subject from history and must put ourselves in the place of the ancients, experiencing the joys and sorrows of that setting with them; then, starting from a certain focal point, we adjust the entire story and embellish it into a new creation. In the past, the great French realist master Flaubert spent ten years writing his famous *Salammbô*, which was "fired" out of this "kiln"; I think a successful historical anecdote must also be "fired" out in this way.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun wrote several *Old Tales Retold* in Xiamen during the fifteenth year of the Republic of China; he selected and preserved "奔月 (Running Towards the Moon)" and "鑄劍 (Forging the Sword)" in his selected works. I will now use "Running Towards the Moon" to conclude this rambling conversation. "Running Towards the Moon" is based on the legend of "Chang'e Ascending to the Moon"; Mr. Lu Xun made this legend realistic. Chang'e was dissatisfied with the reality of her life and flew towards a beautiful fantasy realm; while the warrior—Hou Yi, who crashed into the monument of reality—could only eat "deep-fried noodles with crow," drink "mashed sparrow soup," and sigh at the leopard skin he shot before marriage; and the powerful bow that shot the giant boar could only be used to shoot an old hen, allowing the old woman to laugh at him; this is facing the real world and pulling faces. The last paragraph reads:</p>
<p>"Yi lazily leaned the Sun-Shooting Bow against the hall door and walked into the room. The maids followed him.</p>
<p>'Ah,' Yi sat down and sighed, 'So, your mistress will be happy forever alone. Did she have the heart to leave me and ascend alone? Could it be that she saw me getting old? But she said last month: It's not considered old, and if you consider yourself old, it's a decline in thinking.'</p>
<p>'That's definitely not it,' said Maid B, 'Someone said that master is still a warrior.'</p>
<p>'Sometimes he looks almost like an artist,' said Maid Xin.</p>
<p>'Bullshit—but the deep-fried noodles with crow are indeed not tasty, no wonder she couldn't resist...'</p>
<p>'The place where the leopard-skin cushion is losing hair, I'll cut some skin from the base of the wall to patch it up, it looks terrible,' Maid Xin walked towards the room.</p>
<p>'Wait,' Yi said, thinking for a moment, 'There's no hurry for that. I'm really extremely hungry, so hurry up and make a plate of spicy chicken, and bake five catties of pancakes for me to eat so I can sleep well. Tomorrow, I'll find that Daoist priest to ask for a dose of elixir, eat it, and chase after her...'</p>
<p>After reading it, I felt like I had been showered with cold water in the north wind, and my whole body was shivering! If anyone likes to read historical anecdotes, I would recommend this one first. (The End)</p>
<h3>Towards Evening (10)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>"Ha! Haha!" Hu Yiyuan grabbed the pale white silk trousers with both hands and slapped his legs. His piercing gaze shot directly at the fat-bellied face. "Belongs to the Women's Army! Women's Army—do you know?"</p>
<p>"Women's Army," Li Anke, who had walked half the country, but had not found a single Women's Army member, was stunned.</p>
<p>"Yes! You consider me the commander of the Women's Army, but what about you!" The big belly immediately turned to Hu Yiyuan. "You must be at least a brigade commander!"</p>
<p>"But I'm only half a hundred and one until now."</p>
<p>"But I don't have thousands. You—you, besides, you're still young. If you live to be as old as me, you'll definitely have the qualification of a army commander—army commander!"</p>
<p>Hu Yiyuan's face immediately turned green. "Live to be as old as him, what kind of words are these? It's simply a needle, piercing straight into my heart. He is now forty-six years old, and I am only twenty-four, still twenty-two years away. Alas, not to mention that these twenty-two years can't be gotten through, it's just right now, right now——</p>
<p>"Then I can only win several more lottery fortunes! That's the only way I can do it." Hu Yiyuan waved his hand and paced back and forth. "Like my dad, dad..."</p>
<p>Remembering his father, Hu Yiyuan's face turned from green to white again. His father started his career by issuing pond construction bonds and charity bonds during the warlord era. By the time he died, there were shops of all sizes in the British Concession, the French Concession, and the Japanese Concession, no less than ten or so. You can run all over this place without carrying money. The people on that street, don't know me, that tavern, doesn't recognize my bill. Even in a school of the same hometown association, my father donated 30,000 yuan in funds, and now——</p>
<p>"Damn it. Good deeds can't be done." Hu Yiyuan suddenly said out loud along with his thoughts. "The merits my father made, by the time of the son's era, even a nominal school director doesn't have a share!—I—I want to ask you," he said, standing in front of the two sofa chairs, "How is the situation in your school?"</p>

<p>Telecommunications Special Issue</p>
<p>The Voice of the Telecommunications Industry</p>
<h3>Illegally Established Radio Stations</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a state-owned enterprise, not to be operated by private individuals, the reasons for which are: (1) Private individuals aim to make profits, competing with each other, and seeking the most advantageous, so telecommunications cannot be universally developed; (2) The transmission of news, emphasizes secrecy first, if handled by private individuals, the telecommunications of great importance and affecting the interests of all parties, it is difficult to ensure that it will not be revealed; (3) Telecommunications is to facilitate the public, only belonging to the state, mutual support, can charge lower fees, the burden on the people is lighter, and local pricing, under unified sovereignty, can also be consistent.</p>
<p>Based on these principles, telecommunications in various countries is mostly handled by the state, and there are also organizations that organize companies, but they must also be supervised by the government. If operating telecommunications privately without approval, this is regarded as an illegally established facility. Illegally established facilities jeopardize the sovereignty of telecommunications, damage state-owned enterprises, and according to criminal law and telecommunications regulations, must be subject to the deserved punishment.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, many illegally established radio stations have been discovered within our country, mostly located within concessions. Smaller ones are used for financial and commercial communication between two places, and the more serious ones also collect commercial newspapers for profit, and the impact is multiplied, with many abuses. The case of the two silver firms, Tianjin Yongli and Yongzeng, privately establishing a radio station in the Japanese concession, after being investigated and solved, was brought to justice, and the court ruled that the owners, Fan Jingong, etc., were guilty of continuous group theft, each sentenced to three years of imprisonment, and compensation for the losses of the Ministry of Communications. This measure is sufficient to punish one as a warning to a hundred.</p>
<p>Some say: "Radio waves are not objects, so they cannot be said to be theft; and private reception of radio waves does not cause any loss to the Ministry of Communications' radio station." Radio waves are a kind of capability used to transmit telecommunications, and by emitting this capability, the other party can receive it and form a code. The capability emitted from a state-owned radio station, can only be received by a state-owned radio station, otherwise it is private reception, taking what does not belong to you, which is theft, even those who are not familiar with the law know this, how can they cover up their crime with sophistry? If it is said that private reception of radio waves does not cause any loss to the radio station, then national laws and telecommunications regulations are equal to discarded rubbish. All private individuals can boldly set up stations and receive wireless telecommunications. The state-owned telecommunications industry will be completely destroyed, and the losses suffered by the Ministry of Communications in business over the years due to the influence of illegally established radio stations can also be said to be deserved, is there any such reason in the world?</p>
<h3>Solving the "Time Problem"</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>As the Western saying goes: "Time is money." All scientists—whether economists or physicists—pay attention to the importance of the time problem. Because time is the mother of efficiency, and efficiency is the source of production. If working hours cannot be calculated, or calculated inaccurately, then efficiency cannot be discussed, and how can production develop? In other words, ignoring the time problem can be called anti-scientific spirit.</p>
<p>In order to improve the efficiency of telecommunications administration, the Ministry of Communications has formulated measures for time calibration of national telecommunications administrative agencies, according to the regulations of the Central Astronomical Research Institute, dividing the country into five major time zones as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The Central Plains Zone, which uses the time of 120 degrees east longitude as the standard. Including the fifteen provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, and Liaoning, and Longjiang, Nenjiang, Ai'hui, Mohe west of Hulun, etc., in Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>(B) The Longshu Zone, which uses the time of 105 degrees east longitude as the standard. Including the eight provinces of Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan, and Mongolia and Xining in Qinghai, and areas east of Dege in Xikang.</p>
<p>(C) The Huizang Zone, which uses the time of 90 degrees east longitude as the standard. Including Xinjiang, Tibet, Mongolia, and areas west of Changdu in Xikang, and the western part of Qinghai, and areas west of Anxi in Gansu.</p>
<p>(D) The Kunlun Zone, which uses the time of 82.5 degrees east longitude as the standard. Including Suiding, Yining, Shufu, etc., in Xinjiang, and the western part of Tibet.</p>
<p>(E) The Changbai Zone, which uses the time of 127.5 degrees east longitude as the standard. Including Jilin, and Dalai, Lindian, Qikete east in Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>The time difference of the above time zones is based on the Central Plains Zone. (The Central Plains Zone differs from the standard time of Greenwich, England, by eight hours, that is, when it is 12:00 in Greenwich, it is 20:00 in the Central Plains Zone.) For example, when it is 12:00 in the Central Plains Zone, it is 11:00 in the Longshu Zone, 10:00 in the Huizang Zone, 9:30 in the Kunlun Zone, and 12:30 in the Changbai Zone. Every day, the Nanjing Bureau uses wired radio, and the Shanghai Bureau uses wireless radio at 9:00 am to notify the time in the Central Plains Zone to each bureau and station across the country separately. Each bureau and station calibrates the time according to the time difference in turn. This measure has been implemented since today, and from now on, the time of the whole country will have a certain standard.</p>
<p>There are two advantages of this measure: (1) For communications, it is convenient for auditing report times. Because telegraph communication values speed, especially commercial information. European and American telegrams are calculated in minutes and seconds, and even slight errors are very important. The clocks in local telecommunications bureaus in our country mostly calibrate according to local time, without any standard, so there are cases where the receiving time on telegrams is earlier than the sending time. There are also cases where the sending time is delayed by several hours to receive the telegram. After inquiry, both parties claim that there is no error, because the time is different in each place, making it difficult to audit. Now, after the implementation of the time calibration measure, the disadvantages of the past have been swept away.</p>
<p>(2) For society, it promotes the habit of observing time. Most people in society do not pay attention to the importance of time. Looking at every gathering, people often do not arrive on time, which is a manifestation of a scattered nature, full of disorder and disorganization. Because everyone has their own time, it is impossible to be consistent. To eliminate this drawback, we must pay attention to the accuracy of time. Now that the Ministry of Communications has stipulated a time calibration measure, if people in society want to know exactly what time it is, please ask the local telegraph bureau, wireless radio station, or telephone bureau, which will definitely answer truthfully. Over time, the time of the whole country will have a fixed standard, and acting according to the time will definitely not be delayed. This is of great benefit to promoting the New Life Movement.</p>
<h3>On Outstanding News Telegram Fees</h3>
<p>— Zhong Hua</p>
<p>Our country's telegraph business, due to the huge arrears of official military telegram fees over the years, its economic foundation is on the verge of collapse. Fortunately, in recent years, after the active rectification by the telecommunications authorities, the aforementioned arrears have gradually decreased, and in the future, with political stability, it will not be difficult to return to the right track and collect all the fees. However, in this voice of rectifying arrears, there is still a huge loss in telecommunications economics that has not been paid attention to by the general public, and that is the outstanding news telegram fees.</p>
<p>It is found that news telegrams have the same nature as ordinary telegrams, and according to regulations, they must be paid in cash in advance before they can be sent. However, the telegraph bureau considered that it was inconvenient for news reporters to carry large sums of money when traveling to various places to collect news, so it stipulated a method for the recipient to pay the fees, in order to facilitate them. This method originally stipulated that the news organization receiving the telegram must deposit enough money in the receiving telegraph bureau to cover half a month's fees before it can be sent. This is to prevent arrears of fees, and it seems that there should be no further arrears. However, according to the facts, the arrears of a certain major news agency in the capital has reached more than 300,000 yuan. There are also many others with arrears of more than 10,000 to hundreds of yuan. In other places such as Beiping, Hankou, and Changsha, the news organizations also owe a considerable amount of fees, so the arrears of news telegrams has reached the severity of the arrears of official military telegrams, which should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>As far as the reporter knows, the reasons for the arrears of news telegrams are approximately as follows: (1) Domestic news organizations, except for a few famous newspapers and news agencies, are mostly not economically sufficient. When the telegraph bureau collects fees from them, they often use various methods to delay payment, so that the fees owed accumulate more and more. (2) Telegraph bureaus have historically adopted a laissez-faire policy towards the payment of fees for official military telegrams and news telegrams, only caring that the bureau's income and expenses can be offset, and are unwilling to bother to collect the fees, so as not to increase trivial matters. (3) The responsible personnel of the telegraph bureau do not pay attention to the news telegram regulations, fail to collect deposit money in advance or issue telegrams exceeding the deposit money without urging continued payment, or fail to urge payment and do not stop sending telegrams and notify the sending bureau to reject telegrams, so that telegrams continue to come in, and once ordered to collect the fees, the arrears are already large, causing difficulties. With these three reasons, the arrears of news telegrams has become the serious state it is today.</p>
<p>The telegraph bureau is to assist the cultural industry, and the price of news telegrams is particularly low, only a quarter of the price of ordinary telegrams according to the current regulations. That is, domestic news telegrams are 2.5 cents per Chinese character and 5 cents per foreign character. This low price is not enough to cover the cost of labor and materials for the telegraph bureau. It is heard that the telecommunications authorities will strictly rectify the arrears of news telegrams to avoid more losses. It is hoped that the news media will share the difficulties and not deliberately delay payment again. This is what the reporter earnestly hopes for.</p>
<h3>Currency System and Telecommunications Administration</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>Our country's currency system has become very chaotic due to the free minting of coins by various provinces in the past and the fact that each province governs itself, resulting in reduced purity and failure to meet legal standards. Between Provinces A and B, not only is the coin price not uniform, but it is even not commonly used in different places. The people have suffered greatly from this, and various state-owned enterprises have also been greatly affected. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the financial authorities are now paying attention to this issue and will gradually rectify and reform it, with the aim of making the country uniform. In the past, the American currency system expert Kemmerer was hired to design it properly, and recently, domestic experts have been recruited to conduct research and solicit opinions from all parties for detailed discussion. As a result, the Ministry of Finance will order the mint to mint several kinds of coins, such as five li, one cent, five cents, one dime, two dimes, five dimes, etc. That is, the auxiliary currency notes issued by banks will also be regulated according to this system and must not differ from the legally prescribed numbers. In the future, this legally prescribed auxiliary currency will be used for market circulation, and the various miscellaneous coins of silver, copper, and paper currently circulating on the market will be gradually recovered, and the inferior coins scattered everywhere will be appropriately sorted out and eliminated in advance. Currently, a plan is being drafted in accordance with this, so that it can be presented to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Central Political Council for review, and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval, and then planned for implementation.</p>
<p>At first glance, the above-mentioned problem seems to have nothing to do with telecommunications administration, but after careful thought, the losses suffered by the telecommunications industry due to the currency chaos are indeed not small. The most common is the difficulty in making change for telegram fees, because the value of auxiliary coins is not fixed and changes frequently, so the silver market price must be posted at any time. At the same time, because the legally prescribed various auxiliary coins of "li," "cent," and "dime" have not yet been officially issued, it is difficult to ensure the accuracy of the number of changes made, so there will inevitably be some losses between the sender and the telegraph bureau. Now, in order to ensure that both parties suffer no losses, several telegraph bureaus mostly use stamps to make change, but once the stamps are soiled, they are difficult to use, so this method has not been welcomed by every telegram sender. The fundamental solution is still to quickly mint legally prescribed standard auxiliary coins.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Hao Yang circulating in the Pearl River Basin and the Chuan Yang circulating in Sichuan Province are all of insufficient purity and low value. The former must be discounted when used and cannot be fully used, and the coin price is different between morning and evening, causing many difficulties for the telegraph bureau to calculate the fees. The latter can be fully used within Sichuan Province, but the exchange rate outside the province is sometimes as high as 40% or more. However, all kinds of telecommunications materials and machinery must be purchased with full silver dollars, so the telegraph business income within Sichuan Province is equivalent to a 40% discount. Furthermore, banknotes are rampant in Yunnan Province, and the value has fallen to less than 10% of the face value. In order to avoid losses, the telecommunications authorities can only accept these banknotes at a discount according to the market price, so the people have no ability to send telegrams, and the telecommunications business has declined. In other northern counties, due to the lack of auxiliary coins, various stores arbitrarily issue auxiliary coin notes, and the abuses are unspeakable! Often, the merchants who issue these auxiliary coin notes have already gone bankrupt, or even fabricate false names without store numbers. Of course, the telegraph bureau cautiously accepts these miscellaneous paper auxiliary coins, thus causing many unnecessary disputes. It is heard that the local governments have already severely cracked down on them, but because there is still a lack of legally prescribed auxiliary coins, it is impossible to provide relief for a while.</p>
<p>From the above points, it is sufficient to prove that the telecommunications industry has sympathy for the unification and rectification of the currency system. I hope that the financial authorities will work hard to carry out the project and see it completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>London Internship Diary</h3>
<p>— Guo Maotong</p>
<p>I arrived in London on October 15, 1934. The next day, I went to the Standard Electric Company to discuss the internship course and entrusted them to find a house for me. In the first few days after my arrival, the company guided me to visit the Sonthgate and Woolwich factories, so as to know the general situation of the internal work of the company. The formal internship began on October 22. The internship course is roughly the same as the one planned in China.</p>
<p>The Standard Electric Company's factories were originally located in three places: one in Hendon, one in Southgate, and one in Woolwich. Now the contract period of the Hendon factory has expired, and it has been taken back by the British government, and has been moved to Southgate and Woolwich half a year ago. The Southgate factory is divided into four parts:</p>
<p>(1) Wireless Motor Manufacturing Department: The manufacture of transceivers belongs to it. The department has experts studying the manufacture of wireless motors day and night. It is heard that they recently invented a 505 alarm, which is equipped for ships and coastal radio stations. When a ship sends a distress call, when the wavelength is around 600 meters, this machine will be sensitive and send an alarm signal. When the reporter hears this sound, he can use another machine to search, without having to guard it day and night. Domestic radio stations in our country, which are affiliated with coastal stations, whose reporting duties are not busy, if they can install this machine, do not need to send reporters to guard it all day, and can be managed by other machine reporters concurrently, which can save a lot of labor costs. Also, the factory has a new M15 transmitter, which is a crystal oscillator. The antenna output power is 2,000 watts. The wavelength is 15 meters to 120 meters. The power supply of the whole machine is entirely made of rectifier tubes, and the high-power amplification vacuum tube still uses air-cooling, so there is no need to install pumping cylinders and other equipment as when using water-cooling, so the installation is also simple, which is quite suitable for domestic radio stations in our country. At present, the highest power of domestic radio stations is only 500 watts, and the antenna output power of this 500-watt machine is actually less than 200 watts, so it cannot handle too heavy work, and it will be difficult once the line has obstacles, which is not accidental.</p>
<p>(2) Telephone Machine Manufacturing Department—mostly automatic telephone machines.</p>
<p>(3) Carpentry Factory—the wooden frames of each machine are manufactured here.</p>
<p>(4) General Office—the whole factory has more than 3,000 workers, mostly female workers, working 47 hours a week. The factory is equipped with a hospital and a public dining hall, all of which are public facilities. Each meal is about half the price of other places, so staff and workers mostly have lunch here. The Woolwich factory is divided into three parts:</p>
<p>(1) Cable Manufacturing Department—the raw material copper wire is purchased from other places, not manufactured by the factory itself.</p>
<p>(2) Bulb Manufacturing Department—the bulbs for transceivers belong to it.</p>
<p>(3) Sound Wave Machine Department—such as Jermina Equipment for wireless telephones, and Vokce Frequency Telegraph for wired radios, are all manufactured in this department. Among them, there is a newest Voice Frequency Telegraph. With this machine, 18 telegrams can be sent simultaneously on two copper wires, which can be used in the future on the wired radio lines of our country. The factory has about 2,000 workers, including many female workers.</p>
<p>We lived in a hotel in London for more than ten days before we found a cheaper place to live. The hotel was expensive and the service was not good. We originally wanted to live near Soutbgate, because there was a four-month internship there, but it was difficult to find a house. As a result, we lived in the central area of London and had to take the subway for 45 minutes to the factory every day. London's subway, in terms of equipment and seats, is better than Paris, but the price is more expensive than France; the fare depends on the distance. Also, the direction of the route is not as clear as in France, and it is quite difficult for newcomers.</p>
<p>The post and telecommunications in London are also combined, and the domestic telegram price is very cheap. Excluding the colonies, each telegram costs only one shilling (about 70 cents in Shanghai currency) for up to twelve words. Add one penny for each additional word. There is also a night letter telegram, which also costs one shilling per copy, but the number of words is limited to 36. Add one penny for each additional one to three words.</p>
<p>This time it took 35 days from Shanghai to England, because the Italian ship was faster, so the journey on the ship was only 24 days. We were delayed for ten days on the European continent. If we take other mail ships, we will be delayed for more than 30 days on the ship. Although there are many places to go along the way, the stay is very short, so the knowledge is limited. Especially in terms of telecommunications administration, there can be no more precise investigation. Even if I write it down, it is mostly hearsay. Errors are inevitable. Therefore, at the end of this article, I must specially declare this to the readers.</p>
<h3>Revised Method for Calculating Copy Fees for Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>Sometimes, when we have a certain matter, we want to send telegrams to two relatives or friends who live in the same place at the same time. We don't have to send two separate telegrams with the same text. According to the telegram sending and receiving regulations, we can send a split telegram. This type of split telegram only charges one copy of the telegram fee, in addition to the copy fee, saving a lot of money. According to the previous regulations for domestic telegrams, the copy fee is calculated by charging one copy fee for each additional copy, excluding the original telegram. In other words, for a telegram sent in two copies, only one copy fee is charged. However, according to Article 61, Section 3, Paragraph 4 of the current International Telegraph Convention's Telegraph Regulations: "Copy fees are calculated separately based on the number of words contained in each copy. The number of copies is equal to the number of recipients' names and addresses." Therefore, the number of copy fees for international split telegrams should be calculated based on the number of recipients' names and addresses contained in the telegram. For example, a split telegram listing two recipients' names and addresses should be charged for two copies. This is different from the current calculation methods for domestic and international split telegram copy fees. Ordinary senders are bound to be confused. The Ministry of Communications, in view of this, specially issued an order to telegram bureaus and radio stations across the country, instructing that from March 1 of this year, the number of copy fees to be charged for domestic or international split telegrams shall be calculated based on the number of recipients' names and addresses contained in the telegram, to standardize the process. The reasons are explained as follows:</p>
<p>When a split telegram is delivered, each copy only needs to transcribe one person's name and address. The names and addresses of other recipients and the payment identification are not included. If all recipients' names and addresses need to be fully included, the sender should add the "Gta" character payment identification, and the receiving bureau can handle it accordingly. For example, the following split telegram "TM2 Zhang Boyu, No. 14, Lane 63, Wuding Road, Shanghai II Wang Yuying, No. (Io79), Mahuo Road II Details are settled, waiting to return to Shanghai to discuss in person, Jiong" after being sent to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, should be copied by the bureau into two telegrams when delivered: one "Zhang Boyu, No. 14, Lane 63, Wuding Road, Shanghai II Details are settled, waiting to return to Shanghai to discuss in person, Jiong," and the other "Wang Yuying, No. (Io79), Mahuo Road, Shanghai II Details are settled, waiting to return to Shanghai to discuss in person, Jiong," and the calculated number of words and the actual number of events listed at the end of each telegram should be counted and corrected separately. According to the above regulations, the sender sends a telegram split between two recipients. After the receiving bureau receives it, it must re-copy it into two copies and separately calculate and correct the number of words in each telegram. Since the procedure of copying two copies has been carried out, the copy fee for the telegram should be charged for two copies, which is very reasonable. The Pan-American International Telegraph Union's calculation method for the number of copy fees for international split telegrams is also based on this reason. This revised method will be implemented from today. I am afraid that people from all walks of life do not understand the truth, so I am explaining it here.</p>
<h3>Short Biographies of World Telecommunications Inventors (Continued 1)</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>6. John William Strutt, Radleigh</p>
<p>Lord Rayleigh was a British physicist. Born in 1842 in Langford Grove, Essex. He studied at Cambridge Divinity School. In 1879, he succeeded Clerk-Maxwell as Professor of Experimental Physics at Cavendish College, a position he held for five years. In 1887, he was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy at the Royal Institution, and in 1905 he was elected President of the Royal Society. In 1908, Lord Rayleigh returned to Cambridge University as its Chancellor. He died in 1919. He was one of the most famous experimental physicists of the nineteenth century. He was not only proficient in mathematical analysis but also good at proving his theories with experiments. His experiments were all carried out with self-made equipment. Lord Rayleigh shed new light on various branches of physics, from gas theory to waveform theory and electromagnetism. Relying on his meticulous experimental work, he was the first to discover the existence of argon in the air, which was the beginning of the discovery of most inert gases in the air. The Rayleigh balance, used to measure absolute current, is also very well-known.</p>
<p>7. Edward Branly</p>
<p>Branly was a French radio expert. Born in 1844 in Amiens, France. He studied in Paris as a child and then entered the University of Paris, where he obtained doctorates in physics and medicine. Branly devoted himself to the study of electromagnetic waves for a long time. In 1890 and 1891, he again used radio waves to activate the circuits of local relays over long distances. In 1900, he was awarded a Grand Prize by the International Jury of Superior Precept Instruction for his invention of radio-conductors. In 1890, he published the results of his research on the electrical conductivity of relaxed adhesives and measured the ability of electrical sparks at a certain distance to suddenly change the electrical conductivity of powdered conductors. The so-called coherer detector was also invented by him.</p>
<p>8. Thomas Alva Edison</p>
<p>Edison was born in 1847. He was a great inventor in the field of experimental applied electricity. He initially engaged in the newspaper business, then abandoned it to study telegraphy, especially in the invention of duplex systems. He went to New York in 1871, and his skills gradually became recognized. The duplex telegraph experiment was successful the following year, and the quadruplex telegraph was successful two years later. He then manufactured a large number of products at the Western Union Telegraph Company. In 1876, Edison abandoned his manufacturing plant and built an experimental laboratory in Menlo Park, New York. He then devoted himself to the study of electric light for several years. In 1881, the bamboo filament light bulb experiment was also successful at the Paris Exhibition. In 1878, he invented the phonograph. In 1882, he supervised the construction of the first electric light plant in New York. He then moved his experimental laboratory to Orange, New York, to build a large power plant for experimental and electrical inventions. After painstaking research, he finally invented and manufactured more than 400 types of products. Edison's inventions also include a generator, a loudspeaker, a chemical meter, an electric pen, a mimeograph, a magnetic ore separator, a galvanometer, an electric torpedo, a telephone, and a storage battery. However, he is most praised by the world for improving the telegraph, inventing the light bulb, and the phonograph.</p>
<p>9. Alexander Graham Bell</p>
<p>Bell was a Scottish scientist. Born in 1847 in Edinburgh. After graduating from middle school and university, he obtained a medical doctorate. In 1870, he went to Canada, and two years later he became a professor of vocal cord physiology at Boston University. In 1876, he made his invention of the transmitter public, and the telephone began to transform and create it. He also experimented with an electrical invention to talk to the deaf. The method was to speak into a thin metal sheet to vibrate it and transmit the current to the other end of the wire, so that the vibration of this sheet was transmitted to another metal sheet through the action of a magnet to produce repeated results. Bell's experiment concluded that not only could the vibration of the original metal sheet be transmitted, but the next metal sheet could also generate repeated sound waves. In 1878, Bell invented the photophone—sound film—using changes in light to transmit sound, and then created the phonograph. He wrote many scientific papers. In 1902, he received the Royal Society's Albert Medal, and in 1918 he also received the Society's Hughes Medal. He died in 1922.</p>
<h3>Bi-Monthly News</h3>
<p>Protecting Telegraph and Telephone Poles and Lines: The Ministry of Communications believes that the telegraph and telephone poles and lines in various provinces mostly pass through remote rural areas with few pedestrians. Therefore, petty thieves often steal wires and wooden poles, affecting telegraph and telephone communications and hindering political and military affairs, which is of great importance. Therefore, the Regulations for the Protection of State-Owned Telegraph and Telephone Poles and Lines were drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan to convene the Ministries of Interior, Military Affairs, and Communications, and invite the Ministry of Judicial Administration to jointly review and revise them. The regulations have now been approved by the 197th meeting of the Executive Yuan and issued to all administrative agencies for compliance. The main points of the regulations are summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) State-owned telegraph and telephone poles and lines and their accessories shall be the responsibility of the administrative agencies in the areas through which the poles and lines pass to supervise their subordinate police and groups to patrol and protect them. If theft or damage to the poles and lines is discovered, they shall be strictly investigated and handled, and the telegraph bureau or telephone bureau shall be notified to investigate and repair them.</p>
<p>(2) If more than three thefts of poles and lines occur in a jurisdiction within one month and the perpetrators cannot be apprehended, the responsible personnel of the local administrative agency shall be handed over for disciplinary action in accordance with the Civil Servant Disciplinary Regulations. If the case is solved quickly, the competent authority may include it in the performance evaluation and give rewards.</p>
<p>(3) Perpetrators of theft of poles and lines, those who transport, deposit, or buy stolen goods, and those who damage poles and lines shall be sent to the judicial organs for severe punishment once they are apprehended. If anyone reports the incident and the perpetrators and stolen goods are recovered, the Ministry will grant a bonus at its discretion.</p>
<p>Formulating Telegraph Inspection Procedures: The Ministry of Communications believes that domestic and foreign encrypted telegrams sent by merchants in various places must be inspected. In order to avoid misunderstandings among merchants, the Ministry of Communications has formulated the Telegraph Inspection Procedures. The main points are: If the sender of an encrypted telegram is a reputable business, the business's stamp should be affixed to the bottom of the telegram, and the manager should sign it to guarantee it, which can exempt it from telegram-by-telegram inspection. However, when necessary, the cipher book must still be submitted for inspection. For encrypted telegrams sent by ordinary people, the words and phrases represented by the cipher must be recorded on a separate sheet and submitted to the bureau along with the telegram for inspection. The bureau shall absolutely keep the content of the encrypted telegram confidential. For encrypted telegrams sent by foreign nationals, the local consul should first issue a letter stating the facts or affix the consulate's stamp to the bottom of the telegram to guarantee it, which can exempt it from telegram-by-telegram inspection. However, when necessary, the cipher book must still be submitted for inspection. If there is no consul of that country in the area, the words and phrases represented by the cipher must be recorded on a separate sheet and submitted to the bureau along with the cipher book for inspection. Furthermore, when necessary, encrypted telegrams sent from home and abroad should also be submitted by the recipient for inspection after the cipher book is submitted, before they can be delivered. The bureau shall handle the inspection promptly to ensure that telegrams are not delayed.</p>
<p>Change in International Telegraph Franc Exchange Rate: The international telegraph rate is based on the gold franc as a unit. When our country's telegraph bureau charges fees, it calculates the silver dollar price based on the previously stipulated franc-to-silver dollar exchange rate. The current exchange rate is one yuan in national currency per franc. Due to the drop in the price of gold, it will be changed to 95 cents in national currency from March 1. For example, the price per word for an ordinary telegram to Europe was originally 3 yuan and 45 cents, but from March 1, the fee will only be 3 yuan and 30 cents per word.</p>

<h3>Talking About Schools in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wanglou</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there is truly nothing that doesn't exist. Take opening schools, for example. It sounds almost absurd, but the facts speak louder than words. We don't even need to conduct a survey of schools in Shanghai. Just by paying a little attention on the road, the number of school signs is enough to surprise people. But what's even more amazing is not the vast number of schools, but the choice of school locations. Everyone already knows that schools are opened in Shanghai alleyways and are no longer surprised. But opening schools on the upper floors of cigarette shops, in garret rooms, nailing signs on back doors, etc., still cannot be compared to by schools in any other place, so they still retain their news value and have become a unique feature in the history of opening schools in Shanghai.</p>
<p>With the surge in the number of Shanghai residents in recent years, the need for schools has naturally increased day by day. To meet these needs, schools have naturally sprung up one after another like bamboo shoots after a rain. Enterprising entrepreneurs, seeing this situation, naturally seize a good opportunity without delay. However, poor friends without capital also scrape together a round sum to try it out. However, "everyone can open a school, but each has different tricks." Some build school buildings first, some attract students first, some use propaganda, some advertise the tangible benefits of "job placement," some school directors are tough, some have complete facilities, some say tuition is free, some talk about the oldest brand, everyone has their own say and tries their best to attract customers. But alas, we children who want to pursue some real knowledge are dizzy in this situation.</p>
<p>I remember that an advertisement for a school once listed that the school had flush toilets. I heard that just this one thing won the favor of many students. Based on this, I believe that in the near future, the school will soon have the only air conditioning equipment in the East.</p>
<p>Next, let's review the nature of Shanghai schools.</p>
<p>The nature of Shanghai schools is quite difficult to describe. Here, we will put aside schools of a general nature and only talk about some more special ones. There are dozens of schools that "teach English to women." As for radio, there are naturally radio schools. For repairing or driving cars, there are car schools. For playing the violin, there are violin schools. For learning to type, there are typing schools. For dancing, there are dance schools... In short, as long as there is a certain skill in Shanghai, there will be a school for that skill. Therefore, the number of schools in Shanghai is indeed alarming, and the types and nature of schools are equally worrying.</p>
<h3>Lotus Lantern Season</h3>
<p>— Zongxin</p>
<p>Facing the already fallen Northeast from afar, in the remote border area of the Southwest, there lies the beautiful and secluded Dali, as if everyone has forgotten it! I miss your clear and elegant beauty from afar. I miss the snow on Cangshan Mountain, the moon on Erhai Lake; especially the moon on Erhai Lake in autumn. When I think of autumn, I can't help but recall the unforgettable Lotus Lantern Season on Erhai Lake!</p>
<p>The people of Dali, who live by Cangshan Mountain that never melts its snow, and enjoy the warm spring-like weather year-round while overlooking Erhai Lake, seem to live a more leisurely natural life and dream peaceful dreams. Every year in late April, when spring is old, a cool early summer breeze blows across Erhai Lake in the evening. Countless men and women from every village and family in Dali gather to worship the Three Spirits, traveling three days to the south and four days to the north, celebrating the Raosanling Festival, which is most joyful for young men and women. When the summer night breeze rises from the Erhai Lake beach and floats the fastest, the Torch Festival, which represents the most common rural joy, is intoxicated on the night of June 25. When the autumn wind rises and the Erhai Lake moon becomes even more charming, the most lively Liaoshihui (corpse touching festival) on July 23 dances to the happy sounds within the embrace of all of Dali. On this very night, lotus lanterns bloom on Erhai Lake, what a charming season! How can a weary traveler's heart not be filled with lingering nostalgia?</p>
<p>The spring on Erhai Lake is beautiful with its full and lovely waters, but the summer on Erhai Lake is even more green like a sky mirror. Standing on the beach and staring blankly, you will have the thought of abandoning the dust and rushing into Erhai Lake, willing to sink into the blue waves! Like a beauty's autumn waters, the blue waves yo!</p>
<p>Boating on the floating jade Erhai Lake is most lively and suitable during this Lotus Lantern Season. This day is called the Liaoshihui Festival. The Linshui Pavilion by Erhai Lake gathers many scripture chanters, chanting scriptures to mourn ghosts. The dragon boats and water chestnut picking boats on Erhai Lake almost fill the sea. Above the blue waves, the light boats float and gallop, and the free and unrestrained spirit makes the people on the boats more and more drunk.</p>
<p>This is also the day for the Dali people to secretly observe unmarried couples; young men and women, who have had their marriages arranged by others, want to see what the other person is like, so they can only do so in this customary way, each boating on the sea, looking at each other from across the boat. Therefore, with tens of thousands of boats floating, the shy and private waves of affection are more like the waters of Erhai Lake, "full of spring water in the pool"! Everyone wants to take a trip to Erhai Lake on this day!</p>
<p>The string and pipe music on the boat echoes with the rippling blue waves. The songs convey emotions, young people. This day is happy to the point of madness. Erhai Lake is completely submerged in the jumping of joy.</p>
<p>After a day of drifting to their hearts' content, the people of Dali return home drunk and infatuated, and their fun has not yet dissipated. The night wind is light and fluttering, making the people embraced by Cangshan and Erhai Lake more happy. Therefore, the quiet and dreamy sea night is suddenly dotted with tens of thousands of lotus lanterns. Erhai Lake seems to be surrounded by fire, those beautiful starlight-like fire dots yo. Erhai Lake has changed into fresh, more wonderful and intoxicating clothes: Erhai Lake is jumping and dancing!</p>
<p>The beach is full of tourists, those who release lanterns and those who watch lanterns, most of the people of Dali have run to Erhai Lake for a night tour. Lotus lanterns are floating on the gently rippling sea water, and the lights are flickering, like lotus flowers on the sea. The lotus lantern lights also illuminate the sea water with countless golden waves. The faces of the people on the beach are also lit up by the lights, intoxicating night colors. Laughter, songs, and beautiful light calls, a melodious nocturne rings on the beach! Dali, at this time, is really like a heavenly night, are people so happy?</p>
<p>Lotus Lantern Season, your joyous dream yo!</p>
<h3>Separation</h3>
<p>— Family member</p>
<p>After today, I will have to part with my home and all my beloved relatives again. Originally, in my long-accustomed wandering life, the various sorrows and pains of parting in the human world were absent from me, because I often thought that people were like a wind with no fixed direction, blowing everywhere in the air, wherever it blows is where it is, with no connection of any kind. But at this moment, for some reason, I feel a bit of a desolate feeling in my heart.</p>
<p>This time being able to come home for a short stay is a rare and unexpected joy -- if it weren't for my serious heart disease and wanting to rest, I would not have come back so lightly. And re-tasting the pleasure of reunion in the homeland that is only allowed to be tasted in dreams. But because I didn't want to needlessly add a burden of worry for others, I had already decided to hide my illness and not let anyone know about it. When I stepped into the door on the first day, after my mother's extraordinary surprise, after a while, when she looked closely at my pale and frail face, she asked with concern on her cloudy face:</p>
<p>—Qi'er, why have you become so thin? Are you feeling unwell?</p>
<p>My mother, with her keen eye, must have guessed a bit, but I couldn't bear to have my mother suddenly shoulder a burden of worry between the sudden joy of a long-awaited reunion. I tried my best to suppress the throbbing of my fragile heart, and replied in a very strong tone:</p>
<p>—Mother, no, it's just the fatigue of the journey.</p>
<p>Then, my mother no longer suspected that it was true.</p>
<p>After that, I fell into unspeakable pain. My mother knew that this time I could only stay for a short time, so all my relatives and my mother cherished this short time of reunion even more, and greeted me as carefully and considerately as if greeting a distinguished guest. Under such excessively warm and affectionate emotions, I felt uncomfortable instead, because on the one hand, I had to be extremely careful about my daily life, speech, and actions, making sure not to reveal the slightest trace of illness, and pretending to be a healthy person with no illness everywhere, joking and teasing with my younger siblings, and even having long talks with my mother in the evening, telling her about many things that happened while I was away from home, suppressing all the pain of the illness that could not be overworked, so that in addition to carrying a layer of shackles on my body, I added another layer of shackles on my heart.</p>
<p>But I think that from my different actions that I inadvertently revealed during my daily close contact, my mother was still a bit worried and uneasy.</p>
<p>—Qi'er, I think you must be feeling a bit unwell, tell me.</p>
<p>—No, I feel very good. I still deny it.</p>
<p>—I don't believe your words at all. You've been back for more than ten days, why is your face always pale and getting thinner and thinner? Qi'er, since you're back home, if you're not feeling well, you should quickly recuperate. Everything is convenient at home, unlike when you're away.</p>
<p>—Mother, really not, what would I gain by lying to you? I think, maybe I'm not used to living in the countryside.</p>
<p>At night, after my mother finished a lot of chores, she would often quietly come to my room, sit on the edge of the bed, gently stroking my wrist while repeatedly questioning me in a soft and gentle voice, under the blue and dim gas light. My mother's solemn face, under the irradiation of all the motherhood in the world, sometimes almost moved me to tears.</p>
<p>But I never revealed the secret buried deep in my heart.</p>
<p>The days passed quickly, and the allowed month's stay had passed. Fortunately, my secret was not discovered by anyone. I can use my strength to support my heavier body and run out, and not let my mother know so that she is endlessly worried, which makes me happy. Today is the last day of my stay. Tomorrow I will return home with a sick body, and still leave home with a sick body.</p>
<p>In the evening, my mother asked me again in a tone full of infinite comfort and regret:</p>
<p>—Qi'er, it doesn't matter if you stay for a few more days, why are you going back and forth in such a hurry? You haven't been back for several years, you know!</p>
<p>The whipping of life makes it impossible for me to agree to my mother's kind intentions. Tomorrow I will have to leave in unwillingness to separate. It's just that, Mother! Your forever-thinking son, even he himself does not dare to say whether this parting is a short-term absence or the final eternal farewell?</p>
<p>Such a wisp of smoke-like sadness is now entwined around my thoughts.</p>
<h3>Twilight Visit to Zhenru</h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>The dismal sky hung with a pale green rain, making the universe seem so desolate. Even the streets of metropolitan Shanghai were dampened by the relentless rain, sinking into a state of quietude. Aside from a few people forced to brave the rain-lashed streets, hurrying along, and the tiger-like vehicles roaring through the misty roads, a deep sense of winter's desolation prevailed.</p>
<p>Driven by a small errand and my innate</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>love of exploring in the dreary embrace of misty rain, I decided to venture towards Zhenru, a place not very familiar to me, at this late afternoon hour. I hoped to find some visual satisfaction in this short, hurried rainy day trip, or perhaps to savor the poetic charm of the countryside in the rain. At four o'clock in the afternoon, a young friend and I took a rickety bus from the North Station towards Zhenru.</p>
<p>As the slow-moving bus transitioned from the smooth cement roads to the uneven cobblestone streets of the Zhabei district, the cold winter wind, carrying the scent of the countryside, gradually seeped in through the gaps in the glass windows. It swept across my face, already damp from the rain, and a slight chill seemed to settle in my heart. The heavy snow coat, weighed down by the rain, added to an inexplicable feeling of discomfort. The slow-moving bus took us from the bustling city to a small riverbank, which also ran alongside a railway track. Gradually, the shops disappeared, replaced by glimpses of vegetable gardens or fields beneath the incredibly hazy sky, all in deathly silence. The wild grass growing by the river swayed in the merciless wind like lonely travelers. We had completely left the city, and the bus slowly jostled us along the uneven country roads. Occasionally, through the rain-streaked windows, we could see the subtle movements of the rainy twilight in the countryside. Sparse pedestrians, like lonely stars, or dilapidated buses emitted rumbling sounds. At times, a ferocious, tiger-like locomotive pulling several carriages roared past on the railway tracks. However, apart from these, nothing else could be found in the twilight countryside.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at Zhenru, we entered the National Jinan University. It was almost dark, especially as the dreary drizzle and gray-black sky enveloped everything on the ground, adding to the feeling of calmness. The bustling university was also affected by the rain. Apart from a few students in raincoats hurrying along the uneven, cobblestone paths, the school was devoid of activity. —The semi-new, semi-old buildings, in a 19th-century style, stretched far into the misty rain. As the two of us hurried along the paths, we felt very unfamiliar here, especially as people stared at us with curious eyes. In this quiet twilight, we walked around the school and then, before it got completely dark, hurried through the small streets of the Zhenru market. The small, 18th-century-style town was obscured by the dreary rain, offering little of interest. Thus, we circled a small river far away, bypassed the railway, and returned to the front of the school. We had dinner at Guangdong Ju—it was truly bustling there! It was packed with Guangdong students, filled with the boisterous sound of laughter. After our meal, it was dark when we came outside, and the fierce rain assaulted us, soaking my clothes and seeping through my leather shoes, which were already soaked with mud and rain.</p>
<p>Finally, when the bus arrived, we jumped back on board and let it carry us through the dark countryside back to the city. By then, we could no longer see the scenery outside the bus, only indistinct, dark shapes fleeting past the windows. —February 21st.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhi Advocates Saving the Nation Through Confucian Classics</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Since Hu Shi's speech in Hong Kong opposing the study of Confucian classics in Guangzhou, it has drawn the attention of university professors from various regions. Xu Dishan, a professor at Yenching University, made a statement in Beiping expressing dissatisfaction with the study of classics by professors in the Chinese Literature Department of Zhongda University. Gu Zhi, the head of the department, wrote to President Zou Lu yesterday, refuting Xu's statement, feeling quite agitated. This matter is of great importance, with each side, those in favor and those against, holding their own opinions and refusing to yield. I am not taking sides with or opposing either party, nor am I offering a profound critique of both. However, I would like to briefly explain my personal views on the study of Confucian classics.</p>
<p>The world today is entirely a world of airplanes and cannons. That studying the classics is insufficient to save the nation is self-evident. Even if one wishes to use the study of classics as a bulwark against the decadent social atmosphere and the rampant pursuit of material desires, it would likely be a futile effort. As the ancients said, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and shame; when granaries are full, people know etiquette." In the current economic climate, which is greatly depressed, attempting to engage in leisurely discussions of the Way and studying the classics in schools, while admirable, is simply out of touch with the times. When a person from Wei welcomed his new bride, she boarded the carriage and asked, "Whose horses are these?" The driver replied, "They are borrowed." When the carriage arrived at the gate, she instructed someone to help her mother, extinguished the stove, and said, "It will cause a fire." Upon entering the house and seeing the mortar, she said, "Move it under the window to avoid obstructing passersby." The host laughed at her. These three statements were all important, but she was laughed at because she was out of step with the times.</p>
<p>However, since it is a university and, moreover, a Department of Literature, the Confucian classics do have value in being studied. Because it is called a Department of Literature, its focus should be on the study of literature. Whether it is foreign literature or Chinese literature, both should be studied. Ancient literature and modern literature should also be studied. Without studying them, one cannot deeply understand their merits or demerits. Only through study can one fully understand their mysteries and compare their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Today, some people hold fixed prejudices, becoming dizzy and disoriented upon hearing the mention of studying classics, viewing it as a venomous snake and vehemently denouncing it. This is unnecessary. It is not that books inherently contain beautiful women or golden houses. They are studying literature. As literature, the classics should necessarily be studied. Without studying the classics, how can literature be studied? Does Chinese literature have absolutely no literary significance? Or can the study of literature only focus on the new and not the old, only on foreign literature and not Chinese literature? Such a view may be overly exaggerated.</p>
<p>Therefore, my support for studying classics comes with certain conditions. I do not simply support it without reservation. As for primary and secondary schools that do not specialize in literature, it is acceptable not to study them. It is not particularly harmful to study them either, as the classics are not entirely unnecessary, too obscure, and there is not much time to study them. It is better to select practical and easy-to-understand texts to read for benefit.</p>

<p>The north wind blows chillingly, the beast-charcoal brazier warms the painted building. The beautiful woman sighs softly as she awakens, lamenting that her husband is traveling far away. Frequent thoughts, tears flow, the long night adds to the sorrow. The flock of birds unconsciously chirps clearly, only because the solitary goose finds it difficult to rise above its desolation. The pair are good, but the boat has no rudder, the three-legged bed is a seagull on the water. The iron horse bells jingle, the ignorant rat nibbles at the pillow. At midnight, in the third watch, she dreams of embracing her husband head to head, hands around his waist, legs entwined. Her muscles soften, her bones grow weak, and she gasps softly. The rat comes forward, is she embracing him, are her legs entwined? She wakes up to find that it is just the night watch bell.</p>

<p>The issuance of lottery tickets is for aviation. The measures are appropriate and well-suited. The first prize is a huge sum of 500,000. No discounts, extremely accommodating. All surpluses and funds are used together for construction, not in vain. Those in charge are working hard. There are no malpractices within. Furthermore, the surplus benefits the country and is used for construction to facilitate transportation. Therefore, everyone is willing to buy them. They are popular throughout the country, possessing divine efficacy. From high-ranking officials and young masters to poor barefoot farmers, everyone has a ticket in hand, watching for happiness to descend from the stars. It can achieve two things at once. Buying them hopes to win a thousand zhong of grain. Fortunately, it can really be achieved. A sudden thunderclap shakes the ears. Those unable to buy the whole ticket buy three or five shares with the same number. Unless it does not win, it is still acceptable. When it wins, the aura is magnificent. The huge sum of 500,000 can be obtained, and everyone calls them a rich man. Carriages and horses gather like clouds in front of the door, relatives and friends come to congratulate and bow. Truly, aviation lottery tickets can cure poverty.</p>

Shi means this, or it is said, to examine. The bright decree of Heaven is what Heaven bestows upon us, and what enables us to practice virtue. Always keeping an eye on it means there will be no time when we are not enlightened.) The Emperor's Canon says, "Be able to illuminate great virtue." (The Emperor's Canon, Yao Canon, Yu Shu. Jun, great.) All from being enlightened. (Concluding the quoted books, all speak of the meaning of self-enlightenment.) The first chapter of the Righteous Commentary explains illuminating bright virtue.</p>

<h3>The Various Methods of Memorizing Dialogue by Stars (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Mi Ji</p>
<p>If you suddenly became a movie star, or an actor who had to speak, what method would you use to memorize the dialogue you should recite? Isn't this a very interesting question? Now let me tell you how Hollywood movie stars generally memorize dialogue, which may give you some reference material.</p>
<p>The first time you memorize dialogue, you might be like a primary school student, silently memorizing while reading a book. But soon, you will gain a special method to help you remember. In this way, you unknowingly develop a particularly strange temperament. The strange temperaments are endless. You may like to sit, you may like to stand, or you may like to walk, which is not particularly special. But according to Nat Sparks - who swore it was not a lie - he knew a stage diva who, every time she rehearsed a new play, would go alone to a cemetery in the suburbs in the middle of the night, holding a flashlight and reciting the dialogue while shining it on the script. Isn't that too strange? But many of the methods used by movie stars are also almost as interesting as those mentioned above.</p>
<p>Liu Yalis's method of memorizing dialogue is to set the dialogue to music and sing it, which makes it easier to remember. So after the dialogue for his new film is issued, he sits in front of the piano, playing and singing until he has memorized it thoroughly.</p>
<p>William Fairs often holds the script and strolls around in his orange grove. He walks and recites the script, or rereads it, treating the birds and bees as his audience, often trying out his strange tones and asking himself, "Is this good?"</p>
<p>Paul Muni is one of the most hardworking actors. When he practices dialogue, he always first records what he says into a recorder, and then plays the tape back to listen to the echoes on it. He listens and records, records and listens, until he is satisfied. According to the actors, this is the best way, he can hear whether his accent is correct and how the volume is. Karl Blysen, because he is Danish, also uses this method to correct his accent.</p>
<p>Jini McDonald's method of memorizing dialogue is to write out her dialogue by hand several times. She often locks herself in the study, copying for several hours, until it is thoroughly mastered. Alice White also takes this method. Every night before going to bed, she writes out the dialogue for the next day many times. After getting up early the next morning, she writes it again from memory. Her memory is usually very strong, so when she writes from memory the next morning, she is always word perfect.</p>
<p>Here, I can take this opportunity to declare something. Every actor, before leaving the studio every afternoon, must already know which scenes are being shot tomorrow. So they only need to memorize the dialogue in those scenes, unlike stage actors, who must memorize the entire play's dialogue at once. When a star or actor receives the script, they read it through to understand the general plot and the identity of the character they play. They don't need to memorize the entire script's dialogue first, otherwise they will work hard to no avail, because the wording in it often has to be temporarily changed or added to according to the director's wishes.</p>
<p>Douglas Montgomery has a special temperament. When he memorizes new dialogue, he sits in his car and tells the driver to drive to an uninhabited place in the wilderness, and then opens up the horsepower and goes forward. The faster the car drives, the easier it is to remember the dialogue. Richard Allen's temperament is the opposite of Douglas Montgomery's. He first reads the dialogue at home. When he has read it thoroughly, he drives out himself, with his wife or secretary sitting next to him. His wife or secretary reads the dialogue, and he loudly follows along, until the tone and gestures are perfect. There is also a Pandy Patterson who also insists on sitting in the car to review the dialogue. Her maid serves as her prompter.</p>
<p>If you run to Raymond Novarro's garden and see him waving his hands and talking loudly, you will definitely think he is talking to a friend. But he is alone and has no friends. He walks, rehearses, and makes various shapes, as if he is already in front of the camera. Joan Crawford is almost the opposite of Raymond Novarro. She often mutters to herself alone on the set. She does not like Raymond's first performance. But according to many people, Joan's method of mumbling is the most reliable. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Springtime in Bali"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Legong - Grand Theater</p>
<p>We feel considerable interest in this film, as most of it introduces the people and scenery of Bali in the South Seas. Here are the customs and people of that island nation, which in the 1930s of the 20th century still maintains the customs of the Middle Ages. Women engage in operations and trade, while men play games with cockfights. There is a lovely peace there, with people living peacefully amidst the charming scenery. All that is there is simplicity, kindness, and the unique ethnic character of the East, quiet and characteristic, which is fully introduced on the screen. The bright sunshine, the clear running water, so many lovely natural images! When we feel extreme pain in the cruel reality, we almost think it is a paradise on earth, which makes us feel a sense of escape from the world.</p>
<p>But in fact, we have not forgotten that Bali is a Dutch colony, and how those half-civilized natives live a slave-like life under the political, economic, and cultural invasion of the white race, we can imagine. It is said that the Dutch government's laws for the natives are even more cruel than those of the British, so the tragic encounters of the abused slaves are self-evident. However, this film completely ignores these places. Here we cannot see the traces of the Dutch Empire's rule over the colony. These, which should be used as the main themes to be depicted, do not touch the work at all. On the contrary, they only exaggerate the semi-civilized life, customs, and love between men and women there.</p>
<p>Naturally, what most film artists are most interested in for a certain ethnic group is love between men and women, but it is impossible to obtain an accurate outline by describing it alone away from the political and economic structure. Therefore, it reminds us of "Eskimo" taken from the Arctic. In "Eskimo," the playwright did not ignore how the civilized white race oppressed and bullied the uncivilized natives, and that deep and realistic depiction of inhumane treatment gave us a very deep impression. At the same time, the true value of its film art lies in this, although there can only be a humanistic and sentimental Endingo. The playwright of "Eskimo" also feels a great interest in the love there, and takes it as the main theme, but the tragedy of love that is there is due to political connections, and the film art is successful. However, "Springtime in Bali" is not like this, it is just a screen adaptation of love songs, except for……Should Love enter Thine Eyes and go to thy heart beware……Apart from the depiction of lyric poetry, we cannot see other more important things. Then the author's intention to whitewash peace is extremely obvious</p>
<p>All that exists here is the tragedy of love, but due to the natives’ actors’ unfamiliar acting skills, as well as the playwright or director not handling and arranging it well, the tragic emotions are not properly expressed. However, people who are used to American films with spoken dialogue can naturally change their tastes with this silent film dubbed "Springtime in Bali" (in which there is a sound stage of song and dance). What's more, because of the colorfulness, the appreciation of the color tone can make the audience have a certain degree of satisfaction.</p>
<h3>Review of "Yang Liu Chun Feng" (Willow and Spring Breeze)</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>The Gay Divorcee - Screening at Great Shanghai</p>
<p>In song and dance films that emphasize the lead actors' singing and dancing, and utilize cheaply hired, numerous, and sensual dancers as a large-scale active background, it is originally a difficult and unrealistic expectation to demand a relatively complete plot.</p>
<p>Here, "Spring Breeze and Willow" is not much different from other films of this kind. A so-called singing and dancing artist named He Dun appears on stage and happens to see a young girl named Mei Mei in the concession area. He then pursues her every day in the city, hoping to meet and fall in love with her. Later, the man and woman actually become fond of each other, and a so-called love entanglement occurs. The singing and dancing scenes are drawn out, the active background is moved around, and when everything suddenly becomes quiet, a hot dance and sweet kiss are used to conclude the story.</p>
<p>"Yang Liu Chun Feng" is probably adapted from a stage play, so in the above-mentioned song and dance film formula, it can be considered to have a bit of dramatic content. At the beginning, Mei Mei had to put on He Dun's raincoat to go back because the hem of her dress was caught in her aunt's suitcase and torn. Although it is a bit of a joke that the author uses this to create a relationship between the male and female leads and start the play, the scene where a fake love situation is set up in the hotel to make Mei Mei's husband agree to a divorce, and coincidentally, He Dun barges in and performs a real love drama, and the fact that the husband sees his wife getting along with another man but doesn't care, is quite dramatic. When the attempt to provoke him fails, the fake situation loses its effect, and everyone becomes awkward, a waiter's words unintentionally reveal the husband's secret, and the plot takes a sudden turn for the better. This is also a theatrical technique of "after the darkest willow trees, bright flowers and another village." Here, the playwright unintentionally satirizes the ridiculous reality and underlying nature of the current marriage system. As for the singing and dancing artist and his best friend, the great lawyer, forgetting their leather bags when getting dressed in the tavern, being forced to dance in public until they faint to pay off the debt is a humorous explanation of the roles such gentlemen are playing now.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to utilize the advantages of a stage play, the screenwriter has not suffered from the drawbacks of being limited or constrained by the original work like other adapted scripts, which hinders the characteristics of film art. The point of using a familiar phrase as a code, although not very cinematic, is very helpful in the development and effect of the play.</p>
<p>Director Mark Sandrich's handling is fairly brisk. The montage and interweaving of the shots of He Dun searching for Mei Mei in various places is very good. However, the handling of several large dance scenes failed to avoid vulgarity and wasted opportunities, not achieving anything outstanding. The singing of the five songs also failed to blend into the necessity of the drama. Singing for the sake of singing and dancing for the sake of dancing is a general shortcoming of song and dance films. However, the aunt, who is experienced in love affairs, is written quite well. The way she uses her influence to ask the lawyer for help with her niece's affairs foreshadows the fact that she actually makes an impression on him later, which can be said to be simple, practical, and profound.</p>
<p>In terms of acting, the female lead Qin Qiu Luoji's Mei Mei is better. She plays the demeanor of a young woman who is not loved by her husband but is shy and passionate about another man in a quite delicate and thoughtful manner. The male lead Fu Lei Ya Si Tan's He Dun, with his rogue appearance and smiling face, does win a lot of laughter from the audience, but this also inevitably reduces the effectiveness of the songs he sings.</p>

<h3>Tianyi Snippets</h3>
<p>...Chen Yan, this newcomer, proved that she is best suited to playing tragedies during rehearsals yesterday. She is indeed a tragic talent! When rehearsing the scene of her father's death, Zhang Zhenduo still forced her to marry Liu Er Yanwang—played by Ma Dongwu—she angrily scolded: "You people are truly heartless! You forced my father to death and now you're forcing me again! What exactly do you want?!" As she spoke, she shed real tears.</p>
<p>...Wen Yimin's new work has been planned for a long time, and it is said that a decision will be made soon. According to director Wen, his new work is an ethical and educational film with maternal love as its theme. The outline of the entire play has now been constructed, and the tentative title is "Mother."</p>
<p>...The Tianyi sound film "Arduous Struggle" has been in production for several months and has now been fully completed. The film is directed by Gao Lihen and stars Fan Xuepeng, Li Ying, Shen Yarlun, etc. The results are excellent, and it can be called a perfect domestic sound film.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>The Scholarly Mother (Grand Old Girl) (5)</h3>
<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>Lulan Beiers threw seven points three times in a row. Daide shouted, "Three sevens in a row!" He couldn't help but feel surprised. He immediately grabbed the two dice and examined them carefully. After looking at them for a long time, his eyes suddenly flashed with anger. Just as he opened his big eyes and was about to erupt, Miss Beiers spoke first. She said, "Kelalunsi, there shouldn't be anything wrong with those two bones, right? They're your own things." She said, feeling that this was a bit funny. Taking advantage of Daide opening his big mouth, swallowing a mouthful of saliva, and not being able to say anything, she picked up the banknotes on the table, stuffed them into her large cloth bag, and walked out with a smile. As she left, she said, "Thank you, Kelalunsi. You are still an honest gambler after all. I can rest assured now."</p>
<p>Soon, the "For Rent" sign in front of the empty house next to Daide's place was taken down, and a new sign was put up, with the words "Front Room" written on it, which was in direct competition with Daide's "Back Room." The money won from Kelike Daide's "Back Room" was all used for the decoration and furnishings of Lulan Beiers' "Front Room," making it brand new, ready to compete with his "Back Room." In the "Front Room," there were warm carpets, colorful curtains, comfortable sofas and armchairs, coffee tables, and plates of food. A music team organized by the students provided music for dancing. The carpet was rolled up at one end of the room, creating a smooth dance floor.</p>
<p>Miss Beiers stood there, looking around, and couldn't help but smile. Perhaps, she had finally won... But one should not be complacent too early. However, listening to the children filling the room, talking and laughing, one saying, "Why go to Daide's place anymore? You can drink two glasses of malt ice cream here for the price of one there, and it's the same stuff." Another said, "Hmph! Those tuna and lettuce sandwiches are six cents a piece, and they have real Mayonnaise. Where can you buy that?" Niputong, wearing a waiter's uniform, with a white apron around his waist, grinning from ear to ear, expertly carrying food trays, walking as fast as flying, shouting loudly, "Three double chocolate malt ice creams... Two pineapple sundaes... One lettuce sandwich with pickles..." A loud voice from behind the counter replied, "Coming right up!" Watching and listening to all of this, how could she not be happy! She walked to the counter and asked the waiter inside, "Is everything going well?" The waiter smiled and said, "Couldn't be better! But we're running out of chocolate ice cream." Miss Beiers said, "Sangdi is coming soon. I've already called him."</p>
<p>Saying this, she walked away, hoping for Sangdi, and thinking of Jili Jielai because of Sangdi. Sangdi was also one of her students. He now drove an ice cream delivery truck, but he was a very decent person with great ambition. He was determined not to be a delivery truck driver forever. Sangdi was the only young man in Afangtai'er who was not controlled or seduced by Jili Jielai. He had never entered Daide's door. He delivered ice cream to Daide's door every day and then turned around and left.</p>
<p>He had never been to Daide's "Back Room" until Lulan Beiers suddenly intruded into that place herself. At that time, Jili and many children were playing dice with Daide. When they saw Lulan Beiers suddenly walk in, they felt ashamed and angry, and everyone wanted to make things difficult for her. However, Sangdi suddenly appeared at this moment. Jili was the ringleader of the students, and she ridiculed Beiers. Sangdi then stood up and said to Jili, "What you children need is a good life, and I'm quite interested in giving you that life myself." Saying this, he protected Miss Beiers and came out.
