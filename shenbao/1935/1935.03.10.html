<h3 id="c38">日俄戰爭三十周年之回顧 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>日俄戰爭開始於一九〇四年二月六日。至翌年三月十日奉天（遼寗）一役。日本以三十五萬之衆。驅俄軍於北滿以外。遂獲得最後之勝利。是役也。日軍死傷達四萬餘名。戰事之烈。犧牲之鉅。爲日本對外戰爭中從來所未有。荏苒至今。恰恰已三十周年矣。</p>
<p>日軍部爲追憶其過去勝利之光榮。並鼓舞人民向外發展之情緒。特於今日開會紀念。且又發刊一種小冊子。歷舉日本國力發展之階段。與夫日俄戰爭之世界的意義。以及今後應進之路徑。藉以刺激日本國民對於所謂非常時期之覺悟。吾人膽前顧後。覺日俄戰爭爲决定今日亞東情勢之開端。而今日中國所處之地位與形勢。與三十年前相校。似無甚進步之可言。往者不諫。來者可追。爰舉數義。以告國人。</p>
<p>第一。日俄戰爭之地點在中國領土。其戰爭之原因興終極之目的。亦在中國。當是時也。日本乘戰勝中國之餘威。方有志於亞洲大陸。但向海面發展。被阻於帝俄在遠東之艦隊。向陸上發展。又見扼於帝俄在南滿一帶之旣成勢力。日本爲獲得其在東方之自由發展。對俄作戰。早具决心。以故當戰事發動之際。舉國若狂。羣謂帝國存亡。在此一舉。日本東鄉司。令身先士卒。指揮作戰。終以一年零三月之血戰。將帝俄在東方之勢力摧毀。其北進意志之堅強。足資吾人反省。而其抗敵精神之勇毅。實亦足爲吾人模楷也。</p>
<p>第二。戰事旣吿結束。而日人對滿之經營。乃逐漸開始。擴大南滿鐵道會社之機能。攫取我東北之鐵道敷設與礦山開採權。以及其他種種經濟權益。馴至沿綫之移民警察諸端。日人亦得任意支配。其後因經濟政治侵略之成熟。乃有九一八事變之發生。履霜堅永。决非偶然。而夷考史實。肇其端者。日俄戰爭之役也。日人謂日俄戰爭與滿洲事變具有一貫的歷史演變之意義。且含有轉變世界歷史之價值。良非過言。</p>
<p>第三。日俄戰爭以後。日本以國力之膨脹。加於中國之壓力與年俱增。彼其英日同盟之改訂。日法密約之成立。目的皆在中國。國際財團在華之活動。日本實左右其事。而在前我國國內軍閥之混戰。亦不無予日本以可乘之機。及至歐戰期間。我國所受之壓力愈深。而其獨霸東亞之雄心亦卽於此時更勃然怒放。浸浸有不可遏止之勢。</p>
<p>第四。日本獨霸東亞之企圖。雖於歐戰後之華府會議。曾受相當之打擊。然東亞方面之國際關係。後來反愈益複雜。因此列強在華經濟勢力之競爭。以及我國邊疆之受人侵略。在華府會議以後。均未緩和。洎乎今日。我東北四省之失地未復。而東亞和平之局勢亦亟亟可危。來日大難。正未有已。今後將如何努力。以求自立。挽救危機。實爲今日全國上下。所當鄭重反省之問題</p>
<p>由三十年來之史實觀之。中日兩國無論在政治上經濟上均處於壓迫與被壓迫之不自然關係中。今後中日兩國而果有提携之可能乎。日本宜如何改變其三十年來對我之態度與手段。中日兩國而果不能提携乎。吾人將作何積極的準備與犧牲。以求中國今後在國際間之自由與平等。此又吾人在日俄戰爭三十周年紀念之今日。不能不舉以詢問兩國之注意中日提携問題者。</p>

<p>（倫敦）巴爾幹戰雲瀰慢、惟可恃消息甚為缺乏、故現狀殊難確悉、雖因土耳其集軍保加利亞邊境而起之國際恐慌今已稍减、但南斯拉夫現有牽入漩渦之可能、據貝爾格勒傳來消息、南斯拉夫外部深信不致有國際糾紛因此發生之危險、謂保加利亞或土耳基决不致有干涉希臘叛變之狂妄舉動、但若任何外國加以干涉、則巴爾幹公約即將實施、而南斯拉夫將派兵援助希臘、驅逐入寇外兵云、據羅馬路透電訊、意當局聲明、意國並未援助希臘亂黨、亦未鼓勵保加利亞佔愛琴海之出路、意國完全中立、與希臘叛黨領袖維尼齊洛毫無聯絡云、又據日內瓦消息、保土代表今晨晤談後、保國已撤回送達國聯反對土軍集中於東塞萊斯之抗議書、聞士保間將進行直接談判、以謀此事之和平解决、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）保加利亞代表昨向國聯申請事、今日似已正式解决、國聯秘書長愛文諾與保加利亞代表二次會談時、决將保加利亞之備忘錄、視為一種情報、分交國聯行政院各理事參考、如土耳其政府同意、則土耳其之宣言亦將同樣處理、愛文諾旋復興希臟及土耳其代表相繼談話、結果已使大局和緩、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）歐洲人心今日已大和緩、蓋據正式消息、保加利亞與土耳其之爭、已和平解决矣、惟大戰危機、猶未完全消散、希臘方面、死於內戰者、已逾一千人、而土保兩國仍於邊境駐紮重兵、嚴密戒備、保加利亞代表安東諾夫宜稱、爭端現已解决、保土兩國均已向國聯表示和平志願、並謂現已信土國邊境之軍事行動、非對保加利亞也云、國聯觀察者稱、此事易釀成重大事變、今茲能得和平解决者、實係列強行使壓力所致云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）保如利亞駐國聯會代表頃向報界發表宣言、謂「保國於三月七日致國聯會秘書長愛文諾抗議土耳其軍隊集中保國邊境之備志錄、應作為「不收到」所論、蓋保國已從各方面接得各種必要之緩和辦法、因此認為三月七日之備忘錄無須遞交國聯會行政院」云、按保國此項决定、乃係保士兩國代表由國聯會秘書長居間相互解釋後之結果、又羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥則向羅京拉多爾通信社發表談話、謂保加利亞並無正當動機、遞向國聯會提出交涉、殊堪遺憾、又謂就目前巴爾幹方面之事變、巴爾幹協商公約各簽約國之團結一致、實顯而易見云、（九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會秘書長愛文諾本日延見保加利亞代表安多諾夫、說明該國備忘錄、有錄送土耳其代表閱看之必要、一俟士國答覆之後、即將兩國文伴提交國聯會行政院研究、據聞愛文諾對於保國昨日突然提出備忘錄一舉、認為不合慣例、曾向安多諾表示此意、又此間國際人士亦以為保國代表團事前並未熟權輕重云、本日傍晚、希臘代表拉法爾曾與愛文諾會晤、說明保國在希臘邊境所採軍事措置、不但無益、且有危險云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）土耳其京城傳來消息、謂希臟·土耳其·南斯拉夫·與羅馬尼亞等、巴爾幹協約國對於侵害巴爾幹半島領土現狀之任何企圖、决意予以限止、意國政界人士以為此係對保加利亞一種警告、故聞訊不無憂慮、惟仍深信士保等國、各將邊境防軍充實、僅為預防性質、而無其他用意云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>雅典　希臘內戰中、聞叛黨領袖維尼齊羅受傷、現由驅逐艦運赴亞力山大港、政府軍聞此軍心為之一振、亞力山大港方面宣稱、如叛黨領袖抵此、則將解除其坐艦之武裝、並暫時扣留其槍砲云、戰事仍在希臘各地進行、政府驅逐艦三艘、開砲攻擊克利地島、並猛轟在史特羅曼山谷負嵎之叛眾、聞過去數小時內、叛黨已佔據基奧斯及薩斯兩島、中央軍則俘獲叛徒七百人、其中二百人為軍官云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>雅典　伏洛灣有一南斯拉夫汽船截得無綫電報、謂希臘有名政治家維尼齊洛身受重創、已運往亞力山特里亞港云、此訊如確、則叛眾必為氣沮、叛眾雖經政府軍由海陸空三方面施攻、仍倔強未服、昨日希陸長孔狄列斯將軍親自指揮大軍、猛攻東馬其頓之叛軍、但大雪阻道、政府軍一時不易前進、故以轟炸機十二架轟擊敵陣地、孔氏自信必獲勝利、蓋政府軍有八萬、而叛眾僅六千也、聞叛眾糧食大缺、現赴各村搶刦、據中立方面消息、雙方激戰各負重創後、薩洛尼加乃受叛軍之猛轟、叛黨所據之五軍艦、今不知何在、聞已駛至愛翠海西克萊特斯島附近、政府方面之軍艦四艘、已駛出阻止敵艦駛近雅典砲程能及之地點、京中居民恐受敵艦轟擊、惶惶不安、多遷往比較安寗之鄉間、雅典譬拉曷斯港目下晝夜修固防禦工程、以防敵艦侵入、</p>
<p>希陸長孔狄列斯將軍發表公報稱、雨雪載道、大水氾濫、致政府軍未能渡斯特魯瑪河、叛眾處境殊屬可憫、飛機二十架以炸彈擲擊塞里斯敵軍屯集之處、該地車站、亦為天空轟擊之目標、飛機曾偵察塞里斯之情勢、共地一大部分現為水所淹云、希總理蔡爾達理今日在此晤客時曾承認政府軍為惡劣之氣候所阻、不能乘勝進攻、但謂叛眾終必自行潰散云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>雅典　叛黨艦隊頃已集中馬其頓半島之加伐拉港、要求查爾達里斯內閣立即辭職、而由叛黨領袖維尼瑞洛斯組織政府、不然、則將開砲轟擊雅典、據保加利亞京城消息、謂自昨夜起、離保國邊界二十英里處、叛軍與政府軍隊激戰甚烈、惟希臘駐法公使館發表公報、則謂「各項私人消息、應予極端保留、外間所傳拉里薩城已為叛軍攻陷、沙洛尼克城遭飛機轟炸等說、完全不足置信、政府軍隊現已集中馬其頓省、由陸軍部長頁第利斯指揮、現正偵察叛軍所處地位、貢第利斯業已表示欲儘量减少流血、至於各友邦同情希臘合法政府、希望希臘早平內亂、鞏固巴爾幹和平、此層甚為希臘政府所感激」云、叛黨軍艦「海拉號」與「伯薩拉號」已駛抵加伐拉港、加入該處之叛黨艦隊、並於沿途佔領愛琴海中大部分島嶼、加伐拉與塞拉斯兩地、本為烟草製造業中心、聞烟草廠工人、已成立蘇維埃組織、有共產化之勢、雅典城參議員及眾議員多人及前閣員柴維全亞諾斯將軍等均已被捕、但經宣誓反對叛亂後、即已釋放、總理查爾達利斯之夫人組織紅十字戰地醫院、即將出發赴馬其頓救治傷兵、閨閣少女多人、均志願應募擔任看護、聞維尼瑞洛斯、將在克萊德島及愛翠海若干島嶼內、宣佈獨立、（八日哈瓦斯）</p>

<p>（倫敦）有人建議希臘政府與叛黨、倘雙方自動向列強請求、則列強不妨出任調解、俾希臘亂事、得早歸平靜、英國政府對於此種建議、頗表贊同、據政界人士謂、此次希臘前總理維尼瑞洛斯叛亂事件、完全係關希臘內政、英國不欲加以干涉、惟英國希望巴爾幹半島和平、不至因此擾亂、故願有所盡力、惟英國行動、當絕對以和解為限云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c88">日蘇間的重要懸案 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>（日本通信）</p>
<p>日本與蘇聯的交涉、一張一弛、是遠東方面的危機、這種危機、雖自中東路出賣會議開始後、表面上已緩和了不少、可是現在日蘇間尙有幾件重要懸案、如（一）日蘇「滿」國境委員會的設立、（二）北洋漁業爭端、（三）北庫頁島石油開採權、（四）蘇「滿」間劃非武裝區、日要求蘇方撤退遠東軍備、是値得我們注意的、以上懸案之中、其第一案、蘇方已同意、而該委員會的設立、大約不久可以見諸事實、第二案中一部分、如盧布與日金折價已大體解决、祗漁區的劃定、尙成問題、不過也有解决的可能、但是第三第四兩案、恐怕終於會成日蘇間的懸案、甚至是釀成將來意外的糾紛、也未可知、現在請把關於這兩案的情形、約略報吿一下、</p>
<p>日本近來正在由高度的輕工業國家、轉變爲重工業國家、然而她特別缺乏重工業國家所必需的物資條件、尤其是石油、其本國所產、一九三三年度僅及其總需要的百分之七。八、去年還不及此數、而且沒有可以開發的區域、比較有希望而地域較近的、祇有北庫頁島、可是在那裏日本人的經營成績不良、遠不如蘇聯國營油井出產的數量多、再則就是開採的租約、到明年就要滿期、縱令蘇方准予續租若干年、日本也依舊沒有得到他預期的成績的把握、將來萬一發生戰端、則該處油礦、日本更不容易掌握著、</p>
<p>至於非武裝地帶的劃定、蘇聯是否能同意、還是問題、而日本軍部認爲這是不合日本國防原則的、因爲日本駐在中東路沿綫的軍隊、萬難撤退、所以另行提案、說是蘇聯對遠東方面增加的部隊須撤回原防、使遠東接壤各地歸復九一八以前狀况、從前蘇聯的遠東防務、自赤塔以至海參崴、駐兵不過五萬左右、太平洋師團所包含的人數、也沒有現時這樣多、如今沿阿木爾·烏蘇里鐵道、竟駐有赤軍二十萬人、幷附以有力的空軍、飛機數約六百架、其超重爆炸機有八十架、續航力都在三千公里左右、這些飛機非特可以威脅「偽滿」、幷且還足威脅東京·大阪·京都·名古屋·等日本重要都市、海參崴以前是一個無防備的海港、現時却藏有四十艘潛行艇、如此設防、决不是無的放矢、日本雖用外交辭令、要蘇聯撤防、但蘇聯就肯答應嗎、况且在中東路綫上、日方也駐着兩個巨大師團、一個飛行聯隊、一個坦克車聯隊、日蘇雙方又誰肯輕於先行退讓、退讓了、又那來確實的保障呢、</p>
<p>日本高唱和平、特別要保持遠東和平、但是一九三五年度日本的國防預算、陸海軍合計、竟有十萬零二千一百萬元日金、比日俄戰爭時一年的平均費用還大些、非常時期的緊張情形、更是遍佈於日本全國、蘇聯的國防費、也由五十萬萬盧布增加到六十五萬萬盧布、軍隊從六十萬增加到九十四萬、雙方都不肯示弱、都要策劃己國的安全保際、而且都又認定祗有充分的武裝纔能保安全、</p>
<p>然則日蘇間是否會因陳兵相待、過分準備的緣故將來一觸卽發爆發戰機呢、在半年以前、這是不敢担保的、現在「北滿」方面唯一的禍因、中東鐵道已不致爲戰爭的引綫、故至少在短時間內、是可以沒有問題了、蘇聯方面、向持「人不犯我、我不犯人」的態度、目下當然不會採取進攻的手段、日本呢、近來很明白進攻西比利亞决沒有利益、而且無故用兵也不見得有十分的把握、所以採用外交折衝的方式、想不用武力而達北進的目的、可是日本的現勢、却仍舊非向前發展不可、大陸政策還是要實行的、所以她現在進行的路綫已轉而西向南下了、這是我們不可以不注意的、</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>新疆軍隊與敎育</p>
<p>新省軍隊、楊增新時代、軍實不充、平時亦絕少訓練、在質的方面極爲簡陋、其後金樹仁筦新、頗思整頓、曾購進新軍器不少、及四一二政變後、現邊防督辦盛世才、以政敵派馬仲英張培元等次第剗除、省政亦漸吿統一、乃乘機整理軍務、將所屬尤得勝·孟煦·梁啓文·宋慶齡·沈世麒·等旅、縮編爲團、外加原有各團、約計步兵二十餘團、騎兵九團、團爲編制單位、皆直屬於督署、他如砲兵·工兵·飛機·鋼甲車·歸化軍·等組織、亦無不裁汰老弱、配備新稅武器、今日新疆軍隊之實力、確非昔時可比矣、</p>
<p>歸化軍之由來、先是民國八年、蘇俄革命事業、逐漸進展、皇黨（白俄）軍隊阿年闊夫·巴奇赤等股、各擁衆八九千人、駝馬數千匹、相繼潰竄入新、願內附而歸化、但居心叵測、未及三載、旋釀成阿山奇台等處之事變、槪被省當局繳械遣散、令分駐北疆各縣、幷遣送一部份入關、此卽所稱之歸化民也、二十年哈密事變爆發、省軍以戰事緊急、不敷防守、因復召歸化民二百數十人、編成二個砲兵特務連、歸前方總司令張培元指揮、在僚東包圍和加尼牙孜部、旋被縱出、衆傳歸化軍有異志、金樹仁乃令將武裝解除、遣散歸農、二十二年春迪化被圍、金氏又復召集歸化軍一團、以巴平古台爲團長、嗣歸化軍參加四一二政變有功、遂漸擴充成旅、是年秋、（二十二年）陶李陳等、聯絡巴平古台、倒盛失敗、盛感巴之部下別克迭也夫之吿密、因拘巴氏、而擢別爲旅長、尙有歸軍官切切諾夫、赫洛夫司克·二人、旋說擢任旅長、名義上歸軍已有三旅、實際人數尙不足也、二十三年春、馬仲英敗退南疆、省軍（歸軍在內）節節追擊、別克迭也夫任南疆勦匪總指揮、以新組阿山歸軍領袖沃列克副之、別氏不副民望、旋被調任前敵司令、遺缺由伊黎屯墾使劉斌接充、歸軍大部份、現駐喀什、其戰鬥力、向較其他省軍爲强、</p>
<p>新省敎育、一因占人口數十之六七之纏回、未領悟敎育之眞意義、對敎育之推進、往往加以阻力、一因過去當局之無遠見、對辦學敷衍了事、甚且實行孟祿主義、使書報不得自由輸入、遂致文化敎育、素有落伍之稱、省城現有學校·計俄文法政學院·中學·小學。纏文學校·各一所、女子學校、省縣立各一處、小學人數尙多、中學以上、雖給津貼、學生猶寥寥可數、外縣曾辦小學一二所、校名仍稱國民小學、且因戰事停閉、多數無法恢復、惟迪化所辦纏文學校、自省府任用纏民充任要職、幷得該校創辦人曹啓文等之努力、入學者大有蒸蒸日上之勢、南疆有數縣之纏族領袖、亦提倡願與官廳合辦纏漢合璧學校、使彼此子弟就學、互習纏漢語文、而阿克蘇、喀什、等地、在軍政界服務之纏族、尤多選送子弟、留學俄土各國、逆料纏族敎育觀念、不久必將丕變、民衆敎育、僅省城有一圖書館、陳列書報、多係舊物、民衆運動團體有二、一爲「反帝會、」一爲「婦女協會、」該會係由省立女子學校校長邱毓芳（盛世才夫人）·及股蘭淑（敎廳長張馨夫人）·陳淑敏（財廳長陳德立之妹）·鄭淑媛等主持、提倡女權平等·女子敎育·婚姻自主·婢妾解放等、工作頗力、</p>
<p>語言文字、爲敎育主要工具、新疆民族龐雜、語文各不相同、省城每開各族參加之民衆大會、一族要人、登台演講、必用數族舌人、相繼譯述、麻煩廢時、可以想見、準此以論敎育效能、難與內地並駕齊驅、蓋全非人謀之不臧、實亦有客觀條件之限制焉、惟新省各族語文、比較言之、首推漢纏兩種、最易通行於全疆、官廳公文佈吿、例用漢纏合璧之文字、民間經商交際、漢纏人直用漢纏語、固無論矣、他如蒙古哈薩等族之交接、亦多借用漢纏語文以達意、有時纏語之勢力、且超出漢語以上、各縣纏族薈萃之區、學校敎育、固不發達、但習誦穆敎經典之私塾、則所在多有、故今後新省敎育、苟仍循舊日軌範、僅知實行統一的普通敎育、而不謀變通的特種敎育、（如適應環境、試辦漢纏語文兼讀學校等）、恐必事倍功半也、</p>

<h3 id="c92">負新綏交通重責之　新綏汽車公司 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>由綏遠至哈密　十日內可到達</p>
<p>北平通信、新疆與綏遠之汽車交通成功後、負新綏交通之責任者、爲新綏汽車公司、其組織情况、頃據該公司總經理朱西亭談述如下、</p>
<p>新綏汽車創辦起緣</p>
<p>前數年、綏新商運、純係駱駝、每年兩地僅來往一次、路途稍有不靖、輙至一次往返亦不可得、益以沿途窒碍重重、更給予商運上種種不便、有一次、商人駝戶數十家爲避免沿途過甚束縛起見、繞走外蒙路綫、（俗呼大草地）結果被外蒙將所有駱駝兩千餘匹、商貨四千餘担、悉數扣留、後經竭力交涉、僅放還駱駝二三百隻、貨物四五百件、總計損失約在三百餘萬元、實爲新綏商業最大之致命傷、本人（朱自稱）於民十八九年間、約集同志、乘駝往來該路綫數次、考察所得、遂决定改善新綏貨物運輸、與新綏各同業集資創辦新綏長途汽車、此爲創辦之起緣、</p>
<p>公司股本擴爲百萬</p>
<p>公司股東、純係新綏商人、期以全力培養該路、爲新綏商業之命脈、詎意公司成立以後、卽遭新變、停頓年餘、原有藉通車收入爲流動資金之計劃、亦歸泡影、但在停頓期間、關於沿綫建設、仍未中輟、經濟方面、由舊股東陸續添加股本、並分別坦任週轉金、近來車雖通行、沿途建設、尙待增築、而汽油所需、其數亦復可觀、乃决定將股本擴充爲一百萬元、現已收足六十萬元、餘數現正募集中、希望政府曁有志西北建設事業者、予以匡助、新綏交通旣發達、則西北前途之發展、自可預下、</p>
<p>往返車輛將來增加</p>
<p>新綏間車輛往返、現祇有五十餘輛、以現在商運情形言、足敷應用、將來自當隨時增購新車、按以往統計、新綏貿易最盛年分、有車八十輛、卽可足用、至於往返開到次數、原定每月開車四次、嗣因新變方定、商業尙未復原、商貨無多、故每月開行、不過一二次、就現狀言、公司毫無盈餘、將來貨物數量增多、沿途設施完備後、可望起色、</p>
<p>修路工程分期實施</p>
<p>關於修路、本人（朱自稱）曾親往勘查、現在急應修築者、計爲松樹嶺附近之白莉墩、長約七八十里、居延海附近之軟沙地約三百餘里、均須分別加以平墊工作、百靈廟黑沙圖間、有小河數道、亦須修築橋樑、上英工程、均為大者、刻正積極設法進行、其餘各地之起伏不平者尙多、當隨時修治、現擬分爲三步辦理、第一步工程需時約一年、始可就緒、修路機器、已在滬定妥、下月運到後、卽按照計劃實施、而修路工人、規定分段招募、居延海二里子河附近人工、由金塔·天倉·兩地招募、綏遠至二里子河段、由綏遠招募、哈密附近者、在哈密招募、肅州支綫、在肅州招募、工人所需食料、均僱駝載送分存各站備用、</p>
<p>縮短時間發展業務</p>
<p>該路綫自綏遠至哈密、共長五千餘里、最初係走二十日、嗣减爲十六日、迭經縮减、最近已减爲十日而至八日半、遲緩標準、雖未能確定、但天氣如佳、則行車速率、自較確準、將來俟修路計劃完成後、可望减爲五日往返一次、較諸以往、自不可同日而語、中央及綏新各當局、前曾允予公司物質上之援助、如能實現、發展當更迅速、公司除已與郵局訂立郵件合同外、現正商訂包裹合同、不久卽可成立、如此、公司業務上、又得一種可靠保障、至於客運票價、前曾定有優待學生辦法、志在鼓勵西北學生來內地求學、最近義軍眷屬赴新一事、公司殊願優待、但因人數衆多、如仿照優待學生辦法應之、實非公司能力所能勝任、假定能足汽油所需、其他各費、公司均可免收、個中苦衷、當爲國人所能共諒者也云云、（七日）</p>
<h3 id="c93">銅蕭兩縣　聯合疏濬奎河 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>—宿人反對發生糾紛卽平息</p>
<p>徐州通信、徐屬水利不興、河道久失疏濬、是以每値大雨、農田卽行吿災、今春銅蕭兩縣、聯合疏濬奎河、皖北宿縣人民、起而反對、致發生糾紛、旋卽平息、茲紀情形如次、</p>
<p>奎河水利</p>
<p>奎河發源淤徐城西南之石狗湖、東北流穿蘇隄、經過城南門之東西夾墻、乃折而南下、經奎由·三官廟·十里堡·高營·徐三村·石龍橋·黃橋·伊橋·楊莊·始出銅入蕭、經蕭縣之賈橋·岸樓·鳳凰山·而入宿境、復經石鄉集以達時村、瀉入睢河、全河長約七十餘以里、在銅境者佔四十公里、在蕭境者佔六公里、在宿境者佔三十公里、其水利關係、發源處之石狗湖水涸、湖西杏山迤南之金鐘湖則水溢、灌入奎河、益增其來源、在黃橋之南、復有灌溝河入奎、至伊橋則又有郞溪河入奎、其他沿河渠溝之入奎者、不下七八道、是以專就銅境而言、則奎河已關係縣境東西南三面之水利、至蕭境則又有孤山湖之水入奎、至宿入睢、尤可助增睢河之水利、緣睢河至宿、分爲三股、在城北者曰北股河、在城南者曰中股河、在再南者曰南股河、奎河卽入時村西四里之北股河、足助睢水行舟、且資灌溉也、</p>
<p>聯浚起因</p>
<p>銅蕭聯浚、遠昉民八之蕭宿聯浚、緣當時蕭宿接洽、宿人以奎流經過鳳凰蛋、兩山束水、恐上流既濬、水勢必猛、提議繞鳳凰蛋之西、改開新河道、由蕭人助之、遂疏濬一次、詎蕭人助工之後、而宿人對蕭之濬河、仍取干涉態度、此次銅蕭聯浚、本係繼續以往成案、至預定之辦法、卽蕭境先於本月三日興工、兩週可竣、銅境則於八日興工、一月可竣、並由蕭縣知照宿縣、亦於此際接浚、以興徐屬皖北水利、如此、則前案既可澈底、銅境與奎流有關之金鐘灌溝郎溪諸河流、皆得以暢、蕭境與奎流有關之孤山諸水流、亦蒙其利、呈報專署而後、乃如期興工、</p>
<p>衝突經過</p>
<p>蕭人旣興工、宿人乃於四日集武裝民團及保安隊數百人於石鄉集、是晚、越境入蕭、當以蕭人浚河、集中岸樓、乃向岸樓襲擊、蕭人亦早料宿人必有此舉、業有準備、遂起而抵抗、雙方械鬥、激戰一日夜、至五日晚、宿人以越境勢孤、武力不支、退回宿境、雙方均有傷損、幸尙未有死亡、宿人退回之後、仍集於石鄉鎭、蕭人則集防於鳳凰山、宿縣長曲著勛、馳到石鄉集、電致銅山縣長王公嶼、託轉蕭縣長姚雪懷、相約在鳳凰蛋會晤、王轉姚後、均以未奉命令、不能出境、覆電謝絕、姚旋馳往岸樓督工、王亦於七日晨赴楊莊準備興工、緣銅蕭以預定工程、不能中止、仍須繼續進行也、</p>
<p>專員視察</p>
<p>銅區專員邵漢元、得蕭宿人民衝突報吿、乃於七日晨乘津浦車南下、至曹村下車、時蕭縣已派馬隊迎接、邵乘前往、東行至賈橋、循奎河西隄徒步往岸樓、沿途見蕭人之工作者、壯丁而外、婦孺亦均參加、徐人之苦水、於茲可見、旣抵岸樓、除姚縣長迎晤外、王縣長亦來迎謁、邵氏細察河工、新浚之河面約二十餘公尺、翻土築隄、工程甚固、蕭縣建設科長王念東、亦在岸樓監工、據談、現出三萬民夫、本擬兩週浚竣、茲經加緊開浚、十日卽可完工、此三萬民夫於鳳凰山掩護之下、努力工作、絕無念忽、俾此工完成、續浚其他水流、以解决全境之水利問題云云、王縣長由楊莊來時、率來鄉鎭多人參觀、俾資借鏡、歸去後、卽於明日（八日）開工、姚當向邵報吿當時衝突情形、邵當指示、衝突旣過、勿再起釁、應於正當防衛之下、一面採取和平交涉態度、一面完成浚奎工程、邵逐段巡視後、仍返曹村、趁津浦晚車回徐、至宿民回至石鄉集後、已多解散、惟由保安隊二百人駐守、風潮可望平息、宿縣長曲著勛。七日晚由宿來徐、詢知婦唱夫隨專員王縣長均已往岸樓、未能晤見卽行返宿、大約此事總可和平解决矣、</p>
<p>工程計劃</p>
<p>奎流在銅境最多、經縣府建設科測定、沿途標樁、以三百公尺爲一樁、新河底寬、零號爲四公尺、以下每號遞加六公分九、二三號有城河流入、加寬二公尺、九七號有灌溝河流入、加寬三公尺、一一二號有郞溪河流入、加寬二公尺、至一三一號銅境終點、底寬爲二十公尺、河底傾斜分三段、零號至十七號（蘇隄）爲二千五百分之一、十七號至三十五號（奎山）爲五千分之一、三十五號至一百三十一號（賈橋）為八千分之一、坡度除附城爲一比一外、餘均一比一·五、合計九十六萬土方、役一萬民佚、一月可竣、蕭境河工、略如銅境之終點、而工程十日可畢、迄今（八日）日已得其半、（八日）</p>

<p>—張達民控案昨仍繼續開審—</p>
<p>自電影明星阮玲玉自殺之噩耗刊諸報端後、不僅使阮之親朋哀痛逾恒、卽愛好阮之藝術者、亦無不同聲嘆息、茲將阮之自殺始末、探詢彙誌如下、</p>
<p>化為厲鬼</p>
<p>阮玲玉素富熱情、自與張達民仳離與唐季珊正式同居後、對張仍未稍棄舊情、仍月致津貼百元、共達二年、計洋二千四百元、最近張審知阮深懼訟事、在電影界之地位、又不宜再提過去各事、爲盛名之累乃以控訴方式爲要挾、向阮需索萬元、居間人往返談商、阮已允付給四千元、張不允、又增至六千元、張仍不允、阮以張迫人過甚、乃憤然日、彼（指張達民）誠欺人太甚、余今生雖不願與彼對薄公庭、死後必化爲厲鬼索命、但聽者固未料其卽萌短志也、</p>
<p>暗自服毒</p>
<p>七日晚十一時許、阮猶在聯華製片廠中、與衆友朋暢談、並聚餐宵夜、至十二時許、始返新閘路沁園邨九號寓所二樓臥室中、時唐季珊已入夢、阮未驚動、惟與母則曾談及訟事、謂九成九可勝訴、惟懼上公堂爲衆目所視、旋卽託言腹中飢餓、命侍役爲煮麵一碗果腹、殊不知阮卽以此麵和Barbitono　Sodium安眠藥片三瓶、共三十片服下、竟至不救也、服後並飲茶水、盡二壺、</p>
<p>賺得藥片</p>
<p>阮身體素弱、近數月來、旣卜畫卜夜、盡瘁藝事、而私人不如意事、纏累不休、致神經衰弱殊甚、每晚非服該項安眠藥片、不能入睡、家中原有五瓶、惟阮母爲免彼或於神智失常時發生意外、故迄由阮母保管、近數日中阮先後設計賺得乃母所存藥片三瓶、竟以此致命、然亦可見阮之死志早决、向未爲他人所知耳、</p>
<p>最後安慰</p>
<p>阮服毒後、並書就遺書二通、一致唐季珊、一致社會各界、（或謂一係致張達民者、致唐書、唐未允發表、另一錄後、）書就卽藏諸抽屜中、乃推唐醒、詢以是否眞愛本人、唐答謂確係眞愛、阮卽謂請你給我些安慰（意卽指接吻一次）因爲這是最後一次了、唐見其語氣神色均有異、亟起溫存之、謂何遽作些言、豈已服毒、阮曾佯笑謂未曾、唐不信、乃喚居住三樓之阮母下樓、阮母入室、而阮已不能言語、至是始發覺桌上置有安眠藥空瓶三枚、知已服毒、此前晨三時許事也、</p>
<p>無術回生初、阮曾服毒一次、曾送往北四川路日本福民醫院診治得救、惟時在日間、此次爲阮二次服毒、家人仍如法泡製、殊未知福民醫院晚間無醫生留院、且對國人不無歧視、而其時又在淸晨四時許、欲在北區另覓一完善醫院、竟不可得、最後乃送至一周姓德醫處、並電召老靶子路陳達明、陳繼堯、二兄弟醫師前往診治、至則阮已昏睡榻上、脂粉猶新、纖指因塗蔻丹、股紅欲滴、了無痛苦狀態、陳等卽亟以最新急救方法、每十五分鐘注射一次、並施以洗胃灌腸手術、昏而復甦者數次、然仍無生望、乃送蒲石路中西療養院、假用該院病房、施行人工呼吸及輸送養氣、並將阮裸體浸入熱水浴盆中、但卒因施救過遲、回生術盡、至八日下午六時三十八分氣絕、據某醫生謂、若阮於到達福民醫院時卽以手術方法救治、當有生望、蓋彼時毒性猶在腸胃之中、而未入神經各系也、</p>
<p>法院相騐</p>
<p>前晚、戈登路捕房得阮自殺畢命報吿後、卽飭派華副探長朱夢威等前往調查、卽將阮遺體自膠州路萬國殯儀館舁送斐倫路驗尸所、昨晨十時許、第一特區地方法院檢察處委派宋根山檢察官、偕同魏、張二法醫、書記官王祖翼、蒞所、騐明屍體、首據西副捕頭等稟明經過、又據唐季珊投稱、年四十一歲、廣東中山縣人、業茶商、死者係我女人、曾正式結婚、近因張達民控我夫婦通姦侵占等等、此實冤枉、致彼受此不名譽之事、怨忿自盡、昨晨、余歸家發覺、已無法挽救云云、又據阮何氏投稱、年五十歲、死者係我女兒、當彼自盡時、我睡於樓上、故事前並不知情、現其屍由其夫唐季珊收殮等語、宋君得供、遂諭驗得死者阮玲玉、女性、委係生前服安一眠藥片毒發身死、屍交其夫唐季珊具結領叵棺殮、</p>
<p>明日大殮　旋於十一時許、遺體仍由騐屍所運回萬國殯儀館、卽由該館至樓上手術室中、予以沐浴、並施以屍體美容術、至大殮時期、業已决定於明日下午五時、已由唐宅發出報喪條、分致唐阮生前之友好、報喪條上稱阮女士爲唐季珊夫人、除簡述其死由外、並謂定於十一日申刻大殮、至唐宅家人、昨均在殯儀館中籌備阮之飾終典禮、其沁園村九號住宅、祇有阮之養女小玉在內看守、</p>
<p>殯儀館內</p>
<p>昨日下午三時許、中央社記者復往萬國殯儀館一覘阮之遺體、其時門前車輛甚多、且有多數青年男女、正與守門人交涉、欲入內一瞻遺體、聞陸續前往瞻視者、不下三百餘人、遺容較前晚所見、尤見冷艷、屍體左近圍置花籃十數隻、相映之下、不禁興人面桃花之感、小玉喪服侍母側、尙少戚容、固猶未知此提携數載之養母、卽將成永訣矣、聯華公司總經理羅明佑·明星林楚楚·王人美·金燄·徐來·徐琴芳·劉繼羣·余光·攝影師王紹芬·舞星梁賽珠·賽珊姐妹·燕飛·等、均面現戚容、女星中更多以淚眼相看者、唐季珊衣黑色常禮服、神色沮喪、頻以親友所贈花藍送置阮遺體枕畔、阮母面色蒼白、似終日以淚洗面者、衆人正相歡慰、阮雖已天人永隔、然同情者固尙有人在也、</p>
<p>聯華通電</p>
<p>全國各報館·國內·及南洋·各戲院·暨聯華影片閱者·諸君均鑒、本公司演員阮玲玉女士、忽於三月八日在滬逝世、敝公司同人、一致哀悼、務請尊處各戲院如開演阮女士作品時、萬勿利用女士不幸事件、作爲廣告宣傳、至失敝公司歷來純正營業、尊重商德之旨、敝公司下期聯華盡報發行阮玲玉紀念專號、如有頒賜文字、請於三月十七日以前惠下、其最後作品「國風」亦經於前一日完成、女士在敝公司服務之忠誠、實足矜式、諸維亮鑒、聯華影業公司敬啟、</p>
<p>聯華鑄像</p>
<p>聯華公司同人、爲紀念女士起見、已决定在女士出殯之晶、全體前往恭送、並定期舉行追悼會、此外該公司决定籌集欵項、爲女士鑄一銅像、供於公司中、藉爲永久紀念、並决定該公司同人、對於無謂之輓幛花圈、概不致送、省下之欵、卽爲鑄像之用、又該公司最近由女士主演之國風一片、本已攝竣、近擬將內中二幕籌備重攝、但已無及矣、至該公司籌備攝取之有聲片春到人間、亦本由女士主演、正欲進行開攝、而女士遽作古人矣、</p>
<p>遺書兩通</p>

<p>九八比十八本季新紀錄　暨南六九比十九勝光綠光</p>
<p>江大籃球賽、昨復旦戰持志于復旦體育館中、　而觀者、可五六百人、一堂躋蹌、掌聲時起、復旦係上屆盟主、實力雄厚、持志多新進人物、技藝究欠一籌、相形之下、不營以卵擊石、結果復旦以九十八比十八大捷、比數之巨、堪稱本季新紀錄焉、</p>
<p>實力懸殊</p>
<p>裁判嗚笛啓戰後、復旦傳祥福即連中三元、持志頓現手足失措、攻即不能、守又不可、局勢一瀉千里、持志除由後衛陸止信遠中一球、罰得二分而外、竟毫無建樹、結果以五十五比四、結束上半時、</p>
<p>狂瀾難挽　檸檬過後、復旦馬開驊出場、易上沈崇教、競爭稍見興趣、惟持志前鋒投籃欠準、終難挽巳倒狂瀾、而復旦諸將則有投必應、銀笛長嗚之下、復旦以九十八比十八、旗開得滕焉、</p>
<p>復旦　得分</p>
<p>傳祥瑞　三一</p>
<p>周達雲　二九</p>
<p>丘廣燮　八</p>

<p>另一塲江大籃球光華在暨南比賽、上半時四十九比八、結果六十九比十九、爲一面之局勢、暨南大勝、</p>
<h3 id="c146">東華依舊處女　優游一比四再遭慘敗　雙方一團和氣動作清晰可觀　東華甲組錦標安穩如坐泰山 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>樂華優游、日下午在逸　重逢、作西聯足球甲組第二次循環賽、優游因一二健將之缺席、前鋒實力頓形薄弱、於是結果東華以四比一大勝、造成東華在甲組中、戰十勝之紀錄、昨日天氣和煦、陽光普照、春氣洋洋、逸園塲中、紅男綠女達三四千人之多、雙方表演淸晰、球迷咸爲滿意萬分也、</p>
<p>張榮才守門出色</p>
<p>勝負兵家常事、運動更須重乎精神、東華優游、咋日之表演、可謂極盡客客氣氣之能事、至於攻守作戰、亦各盡其能、絲毫無所偷懶、精神亦即在此、優游昨守勝於攻、張容才之守門、大受衆賞、假以時日、定當刮目、陳鎮祥亦鶴立儕輩、前鋒孫錦順孤掌難嗚、東華之勝、全在乎前鋒之合作較佳、守相仿彿、攻則勝之、賈幼良出步如飛、最爲賣力、五鋒中秦佐芝久疏此道、最爲平平、</p>
<p>相持達四十分鐘</p>
<p>優游開球、最初之十分鐘、雙方機會、極爲平均、五有攻守、各有得失、優游陳鎮祥表演出色、漸見東華佔取攻勢、惟以秦佐芝之動作過慢、徒然望機會而與浩嘆、優游鍾勇森亦與劉祖修互易位置、形勢稍佳、張榮才風頭大出、東華之攻門、可中者凡三次、均落張乎、賈幼良對門一腳、其重無比、亦爲張撲得、一時采聲大作、</p>
<p>陳家球施放冷箭</p>
<p>相持至上半時之最後二分鐘、秦佐芝在左角得球、東華五鋒、一擁進前、秦傳門前、戴麟經得球後送、陳家球在人叢之後、拉起一腳、送一高球、恰巧向球門落入、張榮才跳起捉球、巳落進網內、東華遂先開紀錄、再到中央開球、一轉身已吹休息之笛、上半時東華一對零佔先、</p>
<p>李戴又連中三球</p>
<p>易地再戰、優游全軍用命、努力振作、但前鋒缺少聯絡、每多半途被截、東華旋取猛烈之攻勢、秦佐芝開角球、在門前盤桓不去、李義臣突出重圍、對門力射、球中網角、未及二分鐘、賈幼良挑選中央、阿戴乘虛面攻、一蹴中的、守門無法可想、移時戴得秦傳、又建一功、造成三元、淨獲四球、</p>
<p>孫錦順挽回一腳</p>
<p>凍華不失一兵一卒、連獲四球、氣燄萬丈、光芒逼人、優游全軍憤慨、蓄意報仇、孫錦順衝出人叢、連陷二關、待至適當地點、鐵退一揮、飛入網窠、遂奪回一球、未幾時間吿畢、優游雖欲反攻、亦不能矣、東華以四對一獲勝、</p>

<p>俞同奎詞</p>
<p>次由該處副主任俞同奎致詞、略謂本處今日招待新聞界、有二點意思、（一）要使社會明瞭諮詢機關之性質、蓋本處對於介紹指導等工作固爲重要、而對於調查一項、尤爲注重、希望能達到預備政府統制人才之目的、（二）除希社會人士明瞭本處以外、尙須使社會人士明瞭靑年失業之痛苦情形、學非所用、據調查經騐所得、其咎不在靑年自身、乃是社會造成此種現象、將來擬統計起來、公布社會、使各注意、但同人能力有限、希望新聞界予以指導云云、</p>
<p>馬崇淦詞　最後由申報館馬崇淦致詞、略謂、學術工作諮詢處之工作、乃全民衆之事業、轉達宣傳、乃新聞界之責任、惟個人有數點感想、（一）人才太集中、比較有智識份子、多到都市來、農村中僅有婦孺、（二）學校多集中上海北平等處、內地學生來滬平求學畢業後、大多不願回內地去服務、故希望諮詢處在各省多設分處、一方面調查人才、一方面供給人才、使其普遍、再有業者、往往不能樂業、一受物質誘惑、道德隨而破產、失業原因、大多如此、故更希望諮詢處於介紹職業成就後、應時時指導其安業云云、</p>

<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>小朋友！你們都是學生。但學生和先生，本沒有一定的界限。你們一面可以做學生，但一面也可以做小先生！</p>
<p>我們要接受智識，最初的條件是識字，若不能識字，怎樣能接受多量的智識？即使在耳邊得到一些，也是極有限的。並且每人都需要智識，所以識字每人必需的工具。</p>
<p>我國識字的人是多麼的稀少！每十個人中只有二人能識字。這樣一個國家，怎麼能接受現代的文化？所以普及教育，是現在最切要的工作。</p>
<p>陶行知先生最近提倡普及教育的方法是小先生制。就是把小學生改爲小先生，去教不識字的人，使不識字的人識字，才可以接受多量的智識。</p>
<p>小朋友在一方面講，當然在求學；但和不識字的人比較，你們己是極有智識的人，你們就是十分之三識字人中一份子。你們應該把你們得到的智識，傳到不識字的人羣裏面去，使不識字的人，都能識字，多有接受智識的機會。你們最初把家庭裏不識字的人，都教育好了，最擴充到他家去。這才盡了你們的責任。小朋友們！起來！努力！</p>

<p>— 蓓曇女士</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友，你們瞧「小先生」這個名字，是多麼的淸脆好聽呵！如果有人喊你們一聲「小先生」，你們一定是十分快樂的。其實，我們該知道「小先生」這個名字有點不容易承受呢！</p>
<p>教你們讀書的是誰？當然是「先生」嘍！那末「先生」們不是天天很熱心地教導你們嗎？教你們怎樣寫字，讀書，演算術，唱歌，畫圖以及什麽游戲等等，「先生」是這樣的。不是賣糖果的張三，或學校裏看門的李四這般人都配稱做「先生」。「先生是非常尊嚴而有禮，並且是怪和善的。</p>
<p>「小先生」嗎，這和「先生」完全相同的。不過人家有什麼疑難或不懂的事物來請問你「小先生」時，你該用先生教你們那麽誠懇的態度回答他們；否則你們當不起做「小先生」呵！</p>
<p>雖然，有時或者回答不出人家的問題，或許你們從來所不知道的，哈哈，不要急，不要說先生，就是聖人有時也會被人難住，回答不出來哩。</p>
<p>「小先生」應該有高尙的禮貌，正直的態度，以及果敢，自信，坦白，誠實，仔細，敏捷等等優點。</p>

<p>伶和俐是一對很親愛的姊妹，伶是比俐大二歲，級次又比伊的妹妹高一級，故所以很懂得人事，在家裏便帮助伊的媽媽做些零碎的小事。</p>
<p>有一天，伊的媽媽呌伊去拿一桶水。一桶水是很重的，便去呌伊的妹妹來帮助伊，於是把這一桶水拿到廚房裏去了</p>
<p>「伶姊，你瞧，這一桶水是很淸潔，但是學校裏的先生說：「這裏面是有許多的細菌。」是不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，倘使我們有顯微鏡的話，祇要拿一滴水，放在顯微鏡裏，便能看見不知多少的細菌。」</p>
<p>「那麽我們倒掉了吧！倘使把這水燒了不是依舊有細菌的嗎？」</p>
<p>「不要倒掉，祇要把它燒滾。因爲燒滾了，把這許多的細菌，都燒死了。死的細菌，吃到肚子裏去，不要緊的。」</p>
<p>「燒滾，不行！可還有什麼方法？」</p>
<p>「還有三種方法：一過濾法：用一隻砂濾缸，缸裏是舖一層砂和一層炭屑，水從上面濾下，很淸潔，便可以喝了。二蒸溜法：把水燒熱，水熱了便化了氣，呌做水蒸氣。水蒸氣碰到了冷，便又變成水了。這種水是最淸潔。三化學處理法：倘使我們要把一池的水，都使淸潔，能不能用以前兩個方法？覺得太麻煩了。便可使用到化學處理法，祇要把明礬和其他的化學藥品，放在一池的水裏，一會　，池的水，便很淸潔了。」</p>

<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>春天到了！春天到了！小朋友們又都與高采烈的忙着放風箏了！關於風箏的話，似乎可以談一談：</p>
<p>風箏是用紙和篾子做的，所以又呌做紙鳶。它的形像很多，有美人：有金魚；有蜈蚣；有燕子：有……眞是五光十色，不勝枚舉，最普遍的，是用兩根竹篾子作交叉形，上面糊上一張紙：下面用兩根紙帶子，再繫上繩子，就是風箏了！像這種風箏，祇要兩三枚銅元就可以買到，但是我以爲小朋友大可以自己紮幾個頑，不是更來得經濟嗎？不過雖然同樣的是風箏，但是因爲紮的人的技巧，有的可以一放就起；有的是數放不起；這是因爲風箏的四角輕重不同，所以纔有這種現象。假如是四角輕重不一的風箏，就是能够放起來，也是要翻滾斗的啊！</p>
<p>比較大一點的風箏，上面可以掛上弓弦，放在空中，因爲風的壓力，可以使這弓琤然作聲，倒也好聽。更有人在風箏上燃蠟燭的。不過這都不是小朋友們所能頑的，小朋友力氣太小，祇能放小風箏啊！</p>
<p>據說放風箏要在淸明以前，因爲淸明前的風是向上：淸明後的風是向下；所以過了淸明就不能放了！</p>
<h3 id="c170">兒童科學講座昆蟲的色彩 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>昆蟲的身體，爲什麽總有色彩呢？他們的色彩，爲什麼又都不相同呢？這是值得我們研究的問題，而且也是有趣的問題。但簡單的說：昆蟲要有色彩，不外下面的四種需要：</p>
<p>（一）昆蟲爲要防禦和攻擊，所以他們身體上的色彩，常常和所棲息地方的色彩相同。這一種色彩呌做保護色。像蠡斯，他常在草地上住着，所以他身體的顏色是綠的，蝴蝶表面的顏色雖然美麗，但靜止的時候，却和樹枝的顏色相同，出產在琉球的木葉蝶，靜止的時候，也和一瓣枯葉相彷彿。（圖一）昆蟲有了保護色以後，使他種動物不易辨認，因而保障生命的安全。</p>
<p>（二）也是爲了防禦和攻擊，他們身體的色彩模擬着他種動物或樹枝的色彩，形態。像蜂有毒針，可以保護自己的生命，因此細腰蠅模仿蜂的形態色彩。尺蠖模疑樹枝一樣。（圖二）這種呌做擬態，借別種動物的色彩和形態來保護自己。</p>
<p>（三）警戒別種動物勿來侵犯的作用，而在身體上顯出特種的色彩來，這種色彩呌做警戒色。像蜂有毒針，步行蟲蛄蟖帶惡具，這種昆蟲，是他種動物所不食的，因此，他們就有一種色彩來警戒別種動物。蛄蟖帶長毛，蜂有色彩，步行蟲作金綠色，都是他們的特徵。（圖三）</p>
<p>（四）這一種作用，不但在昆蟲所有，其他各種動物也具有的。就雌雄相擇色。他們各具有着特異的色彩，以吸引異性的愛好。像小紫蝶，小灰蝶的雌雄蟲，都具有極美麗的色彩。豹腳蚊雌雄蟲的色彩，也全部不同，而且往往雄者較雌者美麗的。（圖四）</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們想，昆蟲是在動物中最微賤的，但是他們也會和人類一樣的有各種需要，你們覺得奇妙嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c171">自製坦克車 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 恒久乾綽</p>
<p>說明小朋友們！你們可知道坦克車嗎？這是歐洲大戰中發明的，式樣很多，他的唯一功能，就是能載着槍砲和兵士，爬行高低不平的地方，衝毀敵人的戰壕，他是戰爭中最厲害的機械，現在又有人發明水陸兩用坦克車，効用更大了，小朋友們！這裏我來教你們自製一架小坦克車好嗎？</p>
<p>做法先拿兩個洋綫軸，銼成鋸齒狀，旁邊一枚小釘（圖一；）再把洋燭一小段，鑽兩孔（圖二）和洋綫軸用較粗的橡皮筋運結起來，扣住在兩旁的小釘上（圖三；）然後照（圖四）那樣穿入一枚大釘，這便是坦克車的機器成功。然後再依照圖三綫軸的長短和粗細，配製一車身（圖五，）再加上色彩和名稱，就行了（圖六）。</p>
<p>玩法　把機器上大釘旋轉，絞緊橡皮筋，罩上車身，就能慢慢行動，就是放在高斜不平的地方，也能爬行像眞的一樣。</p>
<p>注意（一）橡皮筋不能太短太長，約比綫軸洋燭的長度略短；（二）橡皮筋不能絞得太緊，因爲太緊容易绷斷；（三）旋轉大釘要向外旋轉。</p>

<p>那黑人回來又處死了我們一個朋友，供他的飯膳了。他睡到第二天，早晨來了，他就像第一次般走了出去。我們當然是每天出去取水果和草本作食物，不然我們也許已死了。</p>
<p>我們害怕巳極，我的朋友們都說自願結果他們的性命了。但我有一個計劃，和他們說知，我們便决意一試。</p>
<p>我說：「朋友們，你知道我們可以覓得好多的木料。此刻我們就將這木料造成了筏，放在水上，臨時我們也可以應用。要是一切都順利，有遭我們的黑仇人死了，那我們儘可留在島上，等甚麽船來載我們回故鄉去。若是我的計劃失敗了，如此就得趕上我們所造的筏出海而去。我原知道道是冒着極大的危險，但我們誰也不願再給此人作下一頓的飯膳」。</p>
<p>天又入夜了，我們的仇人回來又把我們一個朋友作了一餐。接着他睡了，一聽得他的鼾聲，我們留下的十個人便各取了一枝燒紅的鐵义。於是我們爬到仇人跟前去，各將鐵义剌入他的眼睛，使他瞎了。</p>
<p>這一陣痛，使他呌喊起來；他大怒而起，四面摸索着，要捉住了我們一一殺死，但我們兀自避過他。於是他摸到了門，走出去了。</p>
<p>他一去之後，我們便急急地趕到岸邊，上了筏駛出海去。我們决意等到天明，倘見那黑人死了，那我們仍留在島上。</p>
<p>曉光來了，仇人也隨着同來，却另外來了兩個人像他一般高大。他們一見了我們，就把大石塊向我們的筏擲來，他們覷得很準，除了我的筏外，所有的筏全都擊沈了，所有我的朋友，除了兩人外，全都失散了。</p>
<p>我們急着還出海外，在波浪上度夜。這夜有大風潮暴發，海面上很不平靜，時時有大風浪襲住我們，心想我們的筏要碎裂而沈沒了。天明時風潮已過去，我們的筏却拋在一個美秀的島上，我們很快樂的發見樹上都生着佳果。</p>

<p>— 文</p>
<p>本月七日中華日報載：「上海女子趙留家裏，前日在宜昌路賣菜之際，被普陀路捕房六十二號英籍西捕干涉，並加凶毆，以致斃命，本市各界，對此事頗爲憤慨，已由市民聯合會，於昨日午後四時組織趙女被難後援會。……從事進行交涉，務必達到懲凶撫恤目的。」</p>
<p>記得一兩年前，有過與此相類似的一則新聞：「有漆匠劉明山興朋友們在大古瑪頭乘涼，忽被俄捕一腳踢入水裏，但俄捕則說，漆匠自行失足落水的。」</p>
<p>其實上海灘上，二這頭，三道頭們施點小惠——踢，拳，棍——給車夫，小販，苦力；車夫小販苦力身受了，不但不敢抵抗，還得磕頭禮拜，求洋老爺恕罪，這已是司空見慣，不算一回事。然而事情不凑巧，漆匠劉明山「會自行失足落水」賈菜女郎趙留家裏，竟會被石絆跌，流血身死（捕頭馬丁語—見六日本報）而實際上誰都知道前者被賜落水，後者被揮棍擊倒，這刺激太深了，雖看慣了這些把戲的人，也會感動。漆匠事已過去且不談，趙女案後援會已組織成就了，我們希望能達到上項目的，尤望本市婦女團體，起來響應這後援會。</p>
<p>懲兇撫恤，卽能辦到，已是大事小化了，因爲這不是趙女個人的受冤，而是整個民族的恥辱啊！白石</p>
<h3 id="c194">弔阮玲玉 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 白石</p>
<p>當大上海的婦女團體正各在某某大廳花香衣影歡談淸唱以盛大地紀念「三八」國際婦女節的當兒，而在影壇最負盛名的大明星阮玲玉女士，郤正服了安眠藥，呻吟喘息於病院，這是多麽地不和諧—固然，日來婦女自殺的新聞，直可以和叢生的春草競爭；然而爲了無恥的男性兇狗似的追逼，竟使前途有望經濟裕如的大明星，也不得不走上死路，這所含社會性的意義，似乎更深了。</p>
<p>前些時看了阮女士的婚姻訴訟，已彀呌人作嘔，心痛。一個女人和一個公子哥兒離了同居關係，還要她每月津貼百元；及至兩年之期已滿，而仍有意外的糾葛。這一個以金錢的優勢，佔領了阮玲玉的前半生的哥兒，竟以爲阮玲玉是他的囊中物，掌底珠；那一時的同居關係，而死釘住阮玲玉的終身。那是多麽的無聊！而社會人士不給那無聊蟲以制裁，反給阮玲玉以冷殘的刺激，這又是多麽無聊的社會！</p>
<p>眞正的封建時代，沒有厚着臉向女人討生活費的男人。眞正的資本主義時代，男人雖可以向女人要錢而不敢以已經離異的同居關係相強迫。惟有這時，已經離異了的男人，還能容他有保存夫權的理由，又能容他有向女入討錢的寬恕，這才是一個無以名之的鬼怪時代！</p>
<p>時代儘管鬼怪，男性儘管保持他的資本主義社會金錢優勢的男權，更加上墳墓裏挖出的封建意識的男權，以欺壓弱小的女人；女人無處可逃，逃入鬼國的地獄以避免地獄的人間。可是在女人身上發揮了權威的男人，在帝國主義者的眼中，又成了個甚麽呢？</p>
<p>鬼怪的時代，日甚一日地殘殺了弱者的女人，日甚一日建設了男性中心，我們明知大地要陸沈了呢！</p>
<p>阮玲玉女士出身寒微，在影壇雖有超羣的藝術，而仍是封「后」無分：不料在其許多苦悶之餘，竟又爲傖夫旦夕逼迫，致使她拋棄了藝術，拋棄了生命，雙層壓迫下的女同胞，能不同聲一哭嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c195">我們怎樣認識文藝 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 秦川碧</p>
<p>在這裏不能多發揮高深理論，也不曾藉此鼓吹許多女朋友努力做文學家藝術家，只覺得我們對於生活中所常遇到的小說，歌曲，繪畫，音樂，電影，戲劇等等，應有一點正確的賞鑑的法則，因此提出一點粗淺的討論。</p>
<p>在許多事業都不許女性參加的社會中徧藝術這個部門似乎比較地允許女性去接迎。封建社會要女性從事於刺繡，詩詞和繪畫，音樂，是爲了這些東西足以娛樂男子，也足以陶養女性的溫柔情操。詩詞中教女性工愁一善病，把女性比作花，比作烏，還用盡了種種侮弄的名詞形容詞，當時不覺醒的女性對於這種文藝也照樣欣賞，摹擬，以此自鳴得意。封建時代男性中心的一切藝術部門大多是出發於這種意識的，其作用自然在於造成女性的「弱質」與「媚物。」資本主義社會的婦女不再甘心潛伏在家庭中，她們要爭取平等和自由；可是資產階級的統治者照樣想把她們關回家裏去，要切斷她們和社會的一切聯繫；他們除了對於政治，法律，職業，教育各方面限制女性外，對於藝術，提倡女性應以文藝爲養性消逍之玩具，而謬說女性天性近於文藝，這當然是企圖女性醉心於文藝而放棄一切應有的社會職責。因此在資產階級治下，窮苦的婦女固然受不到教育，永遠與正當的文藝無緣；知識婦女對於藝術也因理解之錯誤而不能有正當之欣賞力。至於一般貴婦人當然只有領取些淫糜下流的所謂藝術品以滿足其爲媚物者之麻醉慾而已。</p>
<p>現在，婦女的生活隨着時代之變更而逐漸變史了；我們要以「人」的資格直接和社會的各方面發生關係。在新的社會中，藝術不是玩具，不是供人養性或消遺的，我們更不能承受別人之以此爲愚弄女性的工具，我們對文藝要求得正確的認識。</p>
<p>首先我們要曉得藝術是社會的上層結構，它隨時反映着社會的基本組織。封建時代，男性以領主，貴族，將軍，帝王之雄姿統治着全社會，於是有歌咏男性英雄的詩歌，有獎勵節婦烈女的戲劇，有描寫「才子佳人」「兒女私情」的傳奇。這種種藝術品是代表着當時社會的中心意識，很可能產生極高級的傑作，不但當時使人歌哭，留傳到後世也還足以感動人心，顯示出藝術之偉力，可是這種藝術品放在我們眼前時，我們就要曉得用現代人的眼光——就是說站在今日社會的立塲去理解它們；斷不當以現實的社會人去跟着古人歌哭憂喜。讀得「宮怨」「閨怨」以及無數的性愛的詩詞，我們要從中認出封建婦女是如何做了男性的犧牲，以及男性心目中婦女是怎樣一種柔弱可欺，嬌媚可玩的東西；可不要被那些纏綿幽怨所迷醉，把自己也弄得那麽神經衰弱。讀紅樓夢要認它是一部封建家庭的史書，要發見封建家庭之黒暗和那麽多的女性之可憐與可恥；要嚴防自己之「林黛玉化。」對着舊戲，我們要從那些節婦烈女的故事中認出幾千年來男子籠絡婦女　樣婦女之狠毒，以及幾干年來婦女含血帶淚的生活慘史，如果看了「霸王別姬」公然就也同情地讚嘆起英雄與美人來，那就是中了封建藝術之毒害。以眞覺的興趣來對待藝術，就必然是一個藝術腳下的無利的降伏者。</p>
<p>目前我們生活在中國封建藝術餘精及歐美輸入的資產階級藝術環境中。都市的人員每天聽着舊戲和彈詞的播音，每天看着外來電影的廣告，我們　說這些藝術品絕對不要去欣賞，反之，我們應當加意地給它們嚴正的理解和指摘。十九世紀的歐美寫實主義與自然主羲小說興戲劇，演奏着暴露資本主義罪惡的極偉大的任務；我們應當努力去欣賞，鑑別它們，在一切著名大文學家作品中，儘有着極其錯謬的見解，也很多比歷史讀本更眞確的歷史。託爾斯泰，屠格淫夫，巴爾札克，左拉，莫泊桑，易卜生，簫伯納這些人的作品幾乎比任何害籍都能帮助你瞭解近代歐洲的生活形狀。到了二十世紀的最近十年，電影成了一種最有力量都市教育工具；幾乎一切市民都直接間接受到它的影響，「應當怎樣鑑賞電影？」實在是現代市民應有的課題。尤其那裏面最多演奏着婦女生活的各方面，我們對於現代資產階級最有力的藝術的電影應當注意它是怎樣地教育資座階級婦女以淫靡的裝飾與表情，並且怎樣去迷惑男子；同時，資產階級男子又有如何實婪地玩弄女性。—從不合理的社會制度造出不合理的兩性關係，又由不合理的兩性關係造出多少罪惡與痛苦；這種種豐富又生動的材料只有電影供給我們的最多吧！資產階級的藝術產物中很難找到正確的人生指導；但我們以暴露醜惡和指摘錯誤爲信念而去賞鑑它們時，就可以有所心得。有許多人說，看電影就爲了娛樂，何必再苛求什麽理論問題，這是犯了把娛樂與生活割開的錯誤。人的知識，情操，意識，生活習慣很多處受他平日娛樂的影響；娛樂就是敎育。從娛樂的杯中飲進了毒酒，照樣會使人瘋狂和死亡的。</p>
<p>社會在前進，新興的藝術也在抬頭成長，從代表時代的藝術中　求對於社會的說明和人生的指導，已是逐漸可能的事了。究竟什麽樣的小說的歌曲，戲劇，電影等等才算是今日好的藝術品呢？道裏不是探討高深理論的時機，但也可以爲讀者試舉出一點基本的標準來。第一，只有現實是衡量藝術的標尺；為陳死的古代做宣傳，爲無稽的幻想　問題，都是無意義的。</p>
<p>第二，要以最普遍的事實中之典型物事的題村。在道個飢荒苦痛的世界與國家中，放棄了最廣大的羣衆生活，而專以富貴有閒的人的玩笑，戀愛爲題材，不是我們所需要的。</p>
<p>第三，也許是描寫古代史實，也許是記錄富貴有閒者的生活，但它的旨趣是在爲了帮助對現代的理解，爲了替大衆作暴露的工作，那是正當的，需要的。</p>
<p>第四，構成小說，歌曲的用語或構成戲劇電影的用具，都極其艱澀或昂貴，那不能成爲一般大衆所得享受藝術；也就不是我們應當稱頌的東西了。</p>
<p>第五，任何健全的時代藝術品對於時代中任何社會問題不當有錯誤的演奏。在小說，電影，戲劇，歌唱中發見了它們對女性不正確的說明，我們很可以貶摘了它們的價格。</p>

<h3 id="c196">第二節　由女性優勝到男性優勝 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>女性優勝的事實不祇限於單細胞動物，就是大部分無眷椎動物也是存在的。例如蜘蛛類，大的女蜘蛛拿小的男蜘蛛來交精後，卽刻把牠捕食。又蜜蜂是最顯明的女性中心的例子雄蜂是比雌蜂小到三分之一，而且數亦極少，牠除了執行交精任務外，祇會吃蜜而不會做工作，因此，養蜂者往往把牠殺死！</p>
<p>話雖如此說，但現在許多生物的男性已經進化到了和女性同等的程度，尤其高等動物，例如烏類及哺乳類乃至我們人類，是男性比較女性強大美麗，這是什麼原因呢？</p>
<p>本來男性是以交精爲唯一的生存任務，所以牠被賦與了活動的，猛烈的性慾，牠爲着把新的遺傳要素給與女性而不斷的追求女性，但女性是生物的根幹，是以種族的保存與繁殖爲其任務的，所以，在男性的競爭追求中，冷靜的選擇有利於自己種族的男性來做牠的對象，這種選擇心是女性特有的本能，和男性的性慾完全不同的。這種女性的選擇，遂引起了男性間的嫉妬心，更引起了他們間激烈的競爭，這競爭就有使他們的體格強大美麗的必要。一般高等動物乃至人類男性身體之所以那標強大美麗，可以說都是女性選擇的結果。同時也就是男性由一個無定型的睪丸進化到一斤重的頭　的歷史的原因。</p>
<p>可是，在一般動物界，這標的性優勝，決不是男一支配的意味，譬如說孔雀的優美強大，並不是要用來支配女性，剛剛相反，是要用來得中雌孔雀的選擇，卽是說，雄孔雀仍然保持她的選擇的權利。女性仍然是支配者。</p>
<p>我們時常可以聽到如下的男性優勝論：</p>
<p>『男子的頭腦是一斤，女子的頭腦是八兩』</p>
<p>『男子可以殺牛，女子祇能殺鷄！』</p>
<p>這固然是不可否認的事實，但女性中心說的著者瓦特先生却也吿訴我們如下的更眞確的事實：</p>
<p>『女性是生物的根幹，男性是派生物』</p>
<p>『最原始的男性是一個無定型的睪丸，祇有生殖器而沒有營養機關的小蟲！』</p>
<p>假使說以上兩件都是事實，那末保有一斤重頭腦的現在的男性必定是從「一個定無定型的睪丸」進化下來的東西無疑。但是一個無定型的睪丸怎樣會變化成保有一斤重頭腦的男子漢呢？這是非當有趣的問題，同時我們的課題也就是在於究明男性的這奧妙的進化過程。</p>
<p>瓦特的女性中心說是正確的給我們解决了生物學上男女兩性的優劣問題。據他的研究說來，一切生物都以種的生殖，種的保存及種的繁殖爲其唯一的絕對的任務，而這任務的屨行者便是女性，所以說女性是生物的根幹。</p>
<p>原來生物的生殖，未必就一定需要男性的存在，就是說，在生物界，除了兩性生殖外，還行着廣大的無性生殖的方法。例如所謂分裂生殖，出芽生殖，胞子出芽生殖，胞子生殖等都不經過交精作用而生殖的。這些無性生殖，雖無男性和女性之區別，但生物學者普通以產子者决定爲女性，例如在分裂生殖的塲合，往往使用「母細胞」，「娘細胞」等名詞。這樣看來，生物本來沒有男性也可以生殖的，但爲什麽產生出男性這們東西來使他担任交精的任務呢。這個理由是很簡單，本來生命不單需要量的增加，並且需要生命力的質的進步。就是爲着要繼績其原型，並要獲得其組織上的有利的變化，生命力在向各方面飛躍着的，於是由於適者生存的法則，發見了所謂交精作用的有利方法。所謂交精作用，不外是利用異質的混和，而使其個體的生命發達到更高階段的方法。這樣，男性的交精作用，原來不是生殖上根本的必要的條伴，而是爲了生物的有利的進化而發生的第二義的方去。實際上實行兩性生殖的生物，爲數不及全部生物中之一半。</p>
<p>如上所述，男性是中途派生的東西，並且牠的發生及存在意義，全在於執行交精的任務，所以，某種下等生物的男性，全身都以睪丸而成，旣無營養機關，也沒有自存力，交精的工作完了便先死亡。在某種寄生物方面，女性比男性大到數千倍，在人類，女性的卵子比較男性的精子大到三千倍。我們且看達爾文的一椿有趣的發見吧。他說：『蔓腳貝是祇有女性的，但生牠的兩個貝殼內有兩隻小袋，其中各藏一只小丈夫。更有趣的是具有兩性的蔓腳貝，雖然自身已具有了兩性，但此外還帶着幾只預備的小丈夫，甚至帶着七只的小丈夫』！</p>
<h3 id="c197">意大利的婦女生活 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— （意大利通信）（婉芳）</p>
<p>意大利婦女在「婦女回到家庭中去，工作留給男子去做」的口號下，意大利婦女的實生活怎樣，是值得我們介紹的。</p>
<p>意大利在現時有一百十三萬餘登記的　失業工人，其中婦女佔二十四萬一千左右。但這些多是官方的統計，實際上失業的人數比上面的數目字要多導多，失業的婦女更特別的多。</p>
<p>意政府為了進行反對工廠僱佣婦女的運動，現正從事下列的工作：（一）減低女性勞動的價值和減低工資到最小的數目；（二）使失業的重荷放在婦女的肩上，因為照規矩失業婦女是得不到一點好處的。</p>
<p>現在收稻女工資（十八萬多的農業女工是只做季候工的）從一九二五年二十五個里拉（意大利幣名）減至九·六〇個里拉（一九三三年）·意大利南部的農業女工，牠們的工資竟減到二個半里拉一天！（爲了使讀者知道意大利的工資的實在價值，應該把一公斤的麵包值一個半到一·九〇個里拉來比較）。這些還是汎繫主義的工資合同上的正式削減工資的情形，實際上，削減工資的程度比上述的還要低得多。</p>
<p>此外，勞動婦女的工資乃是會不斷減低的，因爲在工資合同中，已經包含了幾條可以使僱主儘量搾取她們的規則。如紡織業的工資合同（紡織業　佣意大利大部份的工人—六十萬）規定可以減低工資至二十五％—五十％，規定織布有進步可以有償（從減低女工工資那裏得來的），最後，規定工廠裏佔大多數的靑年工人的工資不得超過成年工人資的六十％。</p>
<p>她們在困苦生活中，有的是勇氣，譬如：在亞細亞戈地方，婦女和她們的孩子們組織一個示威運動，反對可強迫工人加入汎擊黨。</p>
<p>尤亭地方有一大羣婦女因救濟權被剝奪了，她們就到市長那裏去示威。事前曾散發了許多傳單。雖然有警察重重的戒備，但示威終於成功了，而他們的要求也得到勝利了。</p>
<h3 id="c198">訪俞慶棠先生 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>在學術界住過的人，誰都知道有俞慶棠這樣一個人吧。</p>
<p>俞先生，在中國是一位民眾教育的最早的提倡者，同時也是一位有數的學者。數年來，她是始終孜孜不倦的在努力着她的教育工作，她故事是却踏實地的，她並不像一般的所謂婦運動袖那樣高興自吹自擂，唱高調，喊口號……這也是她的朋友們所熟知的。</p>
<p>這遭兒，因爲本埠華龍路婦女教育館開幕，難得她先生親自不辭路遠的趕來出席，所以記者特地跑去向池作了三分鐘的訪問。</p>
<p>那天，俞先生的身上，是穿着一件淡灰色的布袍，外面呢，罩着一件豆色的呢大衣，樣兒眞顯得怪撲實誠懇的。</p>
<p>記者等她在台上講演完畢後，便過去向她自陳了來意，隨着，承她的允諾，彼此就痛快地作了下列的一些談話。</p>
<p>「俞先生對於「婦女應回家庭去」這問題的意見怎樣！」</p>
<p>「這問題，我個人的意見是這樣的：婦女跟男子同樣是國家的一個國民，婦女决不能放棄她對國家的責任，而回到家庭裏去幹那些瑣事的的——事實上，產業革命後，大批的婦女早被生活的謳策而參加了社會的生產活動，要回去也是不可能的，所以我總覺得莫索里尼的意見，未免太偏激一些。」</p>
<p>「最近鬧着的蓄髮問題呢？」</p>
<p>「這是一個很小的問題。」俞先生不自禁的笑起來了「無論怎樣，我以爲這是各人應有的自由，如今的中國，有很多很多的大問題，急待着當局的解决，這樣小的事情，當局大可不必操心吧。」</p>
<p>「中國婦女教育今後努力的途徑，先生覺得該如何？」</p>
<p>「婦女敎育是整個敎育問題中的一樣，它同樣是和受着社會的環境所規範的，因此，歸女教育單獨的尋找途徑，似乎是很難的。假定整個教育問題有一天能够得到解决，那末婦女教育當然也便不生問題，所以目前努力的途徑，總仍該以解决整個教育問題爲前題的。」</p>
<p>這時，婦教館方面又有人來跟她商量別的事情了，記者覺不便再多憂，乃興辭而出。</p>
<h3 id="c199">寡婦堂的生活 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>幾年前，我曾參觀過一個寡婦堂。　　這寡婦堂，是一個善堂的附屬事業，房宇便建在善堂的院落內，大門開處，就是善堂的內天井，可是這大門卻不當開，一年中聞不了三五次。這不但說明了住堂的寡婦不能外出，而也就保證她們是確確實實不會有軌外的行動。大門兩旁的墻上，各有一個直徑兩尺餘的圓洞，洞內安有一個側邊開門的活動圓桶，桶內不但能容物，而且坐得下一個十二三歲的孩子。有起事來，被甭在門內的寡婦，只須用手把轉桶一轉，轉桶的門便出現了，將物或小孩好好置於桶內，再把桶一轉，桶的門便又現在外面內天井裏　了。因此這兩個活動的轉桶，便是堂內寡婦女們傳遞消息溝通內外的交通要道。至於內面的信房，則是一棟連一棟的一一底的板壁房。每間房有一個號碼，而每一號碼則住一家人。</p>
<p>住堂的寡婦雖複雜，但我們可依據她們入堂的動機，將她們大別為兩種；一是欲解決非生活的，一是欲求名的。因為寡婦一進了堂，除每月可由本善堂發下的月錢以解決一已的生活外兒子可在內住到二三歲，女兒可住到出嫁的日子每個孩子在內又可領得大人二分之一的月錢，而孩子們尙可進善堂的義校讀書，這豈不等於全部生活負擔都解决了嗎？</p>
<p>經二種求名的人呢，那當然是富貴人家的寡婦了。她們進堂的動因，又可大別為三；一，那些食丰食足的富貴人家，有了一個年紀輕輕的寡婦集在家幾，性格老實的不用說，生得風騷點刁滑點的，那就成了娘婆兩家的大憂心。結果，大家惟有想盡方法，求她進堂，這麼一來，不但不會演出醜事，而在鄉黨鄰里間，又是一件名譽事。二，有些年輕的寡婦，因夫家的大家庭，人口多家規嚴，遂欲籍進堂以駾出這種家庭獄牢的，三，有些生今之世而心獨古的諸多了四書五經的女聖人們，她門是為守真守節流芳百世而入堂的。</p>
<p>此外，我也要講講堂內的生活以及入堂的現則和手續等。</p>
<p>寡婦除有特別事故請假——這是很不容易照准的——再計，每年定例只能放出外兩次，每次期限五七天不等。這兩次，便是三月清明掃墓，七月中元祭祖。她們平日在堂內生活，卻頗由已。伙食是由各人自理，各家管各家的，用水則歸公家供給，購買物品，公家有兩個專管採售的女僕包辦，堂內即有貧富兩種人，所以她們的生活也有兩樣。貧寡婦除做自已和孩子們的衣服鞋襪外，大都接有外面的活做，如做鞋花，縫衣，刺緒，縫羊蔑頭，　鞭引，以及旁的輕便乎工等。富寡婦呢？她們自身應做的一切事，都可用錢請貧寡婦代做，而選要不時偷偷摸摸打打牌。</p>
<p>講到進堂的規則和物續，除明文規定年齡麼在三十以下——即愈年輕，愈有資格——而外，餘則頗難說。因爲一方面它既不像學校招生似的，貼撾廣吿與簡章，外人無從知曉，一方面已進堂的人，似乎十之九是不合法的。因為我們知道寡婦堂之所以設立，無非是　於仁人君子們的「維持風化」「恤寡念貧」的善意。可是事實上，能打進寡婦堂的女人沒有一個不是與那善堂的首士（總經）或大施主有深關係的人。有錢人要進堂更是容易，只要馬上捐洋數百或數千就行。眞正貧苦無靠的年輕寡婦，寡婦堂的鬥對她們是緊緊閉着的！</p>
<p>講到這免，我們要問眞正窮苦無靠的年輕寡婦，如若寡婦堂的門對她們是敞開着的，她們可又有守節的可能嗎？在這買賣式的婚姻制度之下，中國社會的一般現狀，無論那一鄉村那一城鎮的窮家小戶，如若家裏有了一個年輕的寡婦，爲　婆，伯叔，或兄嫂的，十固中有九個，是想盡了方法，要把道可憐的寡婦再嫁（即轉賣）出去。從令寡婦本身。怎樣自願守節，也是不可能的。魯迅先生在他的小說祝福中，把這種情勢表現得很淸楚。當四太太聽說祥林嫂被她婆　強逼羞冉嫁出去了，而吃驚地說；</p>
<p>「啊呀，這樣的婆婆！」時，衛老婆子却答道</p>
<p>「啊呀，我的太太！你眞是大戶人家太大的話，我們山裏人，這算得什麽？她有小叔子，也得娶老婆。　嫁了她，那有這一注錢來做　禮？」所以說，做節婦守寡也不是一般人都　得到的事哦。</p>

<h3 id="c200">談經濟原理 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 宋旭東</p>
<p>這裏所說的「經濟原理」，並不是指的一般的經濟學上的原理而言，乃是指一切具有簡約，節省，便利的法則性的原理而言。這一「經濟原理」的名詞，只要是稍爲學過一點哲學的人，都知道那是馬赫的所謂新發明。「經濟原理」在馬赫哲學中的原義，是說一切客觀事物的認識，概念，知識，都只能歸納於主觀的威覺要素之綜合，不是客觀的反映，而這感覺要素與其綜合之可能和開式，則是預存於威覺和經騐中的先天的原理，我們的認識與知識，只根據這先騐的世界要素就可獲得一切，吸盡一切，並且也只能够根據它才能有所謂認識和知識，甚麽外界，客觀，在它看來都是沒有的，不知道的。這就是說認識這件事，惟戚覺是唯一的存在，一切繁複的外界可以經濟到唯一的主觀威覺之綜合，而這戚覺的綜合又可以經濟到先騐的世界要素或原理，這是多麽省事，節約，便利呢！馬赫的這種哲學，雖然王星拱先生在他的科學方法論中這樣稱讚他，說「我們研究科學是要獲思想之效，馬赫以思想經濟爲科學之唯一的職務，確是有見地的言論。」但我們覺得王先生不但沒有看出馬赫哲學之觀念論和信仰主義的馬腳，而且還把馬赫的經濟原理拿來和科學上的思想經濟等量齊觀，這恐怕是一種錯誤罷！我們也覺得在人類文化進展過程中，的確有所謂經濟原理存在着，但和馬赫的所謂經濟原理，却是風馬牛不相及的東西。因爲前者是玄學甚至信仰主義的，而後者則是科學的。</p>
<p>人類的知識之發展，其一定的知識體系和定律，在其形成之先，是要經過很多人的努力才能成功的。不但在人數上，一種定律要經過無數的實踐者，無數的學問家，在有意無意中，從無限的繁雜事實裏，去經騐，觀察，思索，實騐，才能抽出一個原則來定爲規律，而且在時間上也往往要或短或長的許多時間。比如由摩擦生熱這一節單事實來說，本可以得出熱爲一種運動與能力轉換和不減定律的，但是從野蠻人起早知用木或石摩擦生熱取火，却不能得出這種科學的結論。而且，就到文藝復興以後，科學已經開始昌明了，然而在十八世紀也還盛行着火質或熱素說。只有一直到了十九世紀，才由許多學者不斷的經騐，觀察，思考，實騐，知道熱爲一種分子運動，知道摩擦那種力學的運動能轉換爲熱，而摩擦那種運動能也沒有空空的喪失於無有，乃是變成了熱能。如此，則我們可以知道一種原理或定律的形成，是要經過如何不經濟的思維與勞力的浪費的了。但是，在前人的不經濟的努力中，獲得了一種知識體系，一種原理或定律，並遺傳給後人，於是後人在對於客觀世界的繼續探索中，就可以不必再去瞎莫瞎碰，再去把那些已爲這原理或定律所包括了的事實重複地經騐，觀察，思考，實騐，而可以直接採取那原理或定律去規範新的材料與事實，向新的眞理途中邁進了。這樣，我們眞可以說這是眞正的思想經濟原理，因爲它的確能使我們經濟思維，經濟勞力和時間。例如圓週與圓球的計算，在知道兀的常數等於31416以後，我們在計算任何圓週與圓球時，只用這常數代進去</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>就是，用不着再去演算了。他如物理學中的氣壓定律公式，萬有引力公式，化學中的原子量，生物學上的物競天擇，適者生存，社會學上的物觀的歷史定律等等，只要我們一經知道了，以後在需用它時，不必再去從每件事中重複計算，考察，推論，比較，卽可很便利省事地根據它去探求和發現新的眞理·科學，是人類知識的全部遺產，它能使承繼這遺產的後人，在繼續研究中經濟他的思想，勞力；科學定律就是人類思想上的經濟原理。</p>
<p>不特思想上有這樣的經濟原理，卽在人類的生產勞產動和物質生活過程中，也有這種經濟原理存在着；一切遠古人類直到現在的發明品，都是能使我們在對自然舉行鬥爭和克服自然時節省我們的勞力的經濟原理。因爲我們若不能利用前人的發明，樣樣都要靠自己發明出東西來去對付自然，那不但費力太多，並且不能收得大量的成效。前人發明了火，能使我們後人很經濟的把飯菜容易弄軟弄熟，把鐵燒軟便於製器；前人發明了船，能使我們不費力的得以渡過河海，否則，我們吃東西時便要多費精力和時間去咀嚼，我們要把生鐵磨捶成器不知要多費多少冤枉精力和時間，我們要泳過大河大海幾乎成爲不可能。近代人發明了機器代替人力，孤種省事和生產上的迅速功效，又不知節省了我們在生產上的多少體力，這不是經濟原理是甚麽？如果更進一步說，科學和生產的發達，就速自然的時間和空間，都使我們能蒙前人的恩賜而經濟地使用了。以前沒有輪船，火車，飛機時，這繞地球一週的事，在我們看來是很大的一個空間，但現在我們等於把它縮短縮小了，一週內卽可經濟地渡過這個空間。在時間上以前步行恐怕要經過幾年之久，但在現在則於一週的時間內卽能辦到。望遠鏡把遠在若千萬萬里外的星球弄得像在眼前一樣讓你觀察，無綫電報和有綫電報能使你在幾點鐘內得着數萬里外的消息，這不是時間空間都被人經濟地利用了嗎？</p>
<p>總之，科學的發達，人類生產的進步，都是使我們生活，思想經濟省事的，這是科學的經濟原理，不是馬赫的形而上學的經濟原理。人類在這經濟原理中被推進，文化在這經濟原理中才能發達。人類沒有這一經濟原理的作用，則如今必還在野蠻的階段，不能有多的思想和豐富的生活，所以精神與物質文明都產生於這經濟原理之中。</p>
<p>職業婦女的自白</p>
<h3 id="c201">枯骨 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 鵑女士記</p>
<p>女相士紅梅談</p>
<p>我是在十九年前的一個春天，托生在長虹　　的武書的一個「世家」裏面：當我誔生的那天，闔家都懷着一種說不出的愉快情緒。雖然重男輕女的觀念，在我們這個家庭裏還是根深蒂固的存在着，但是因了我父親結婚了七年，才有了我這樣的一個女孩子，所以當時也不免爲我熱鬧了一番。</p>
<p>父親是一個渾原質樸的中年人，他的一生，可以說是安你守己的過着平淡的生活；家庭裏一切對內對外的事務，都是由母親一個人單獨主特。母親雖是個思想陳舊的女子，但她的學問經騐和處世的閱歷，却要此父親高得多了；一　　着三十多人　　　家庭　　切收入　　　　賬　　都　由母親　　　　着支配的大權，這不能不說是要有相當的材幹的。</p>
<p>我生長在這樣一個家庭的環境裏，當時所享受的那種幸福，的確不是我這時可以用言語表現得出來；我父親他是寗可不問家事，但對我的生活環境却是一點也不肯漠然不顧的。他日常的生活，除了一小部分時間用在看書上面，其餘的時間差不多都是在和我嬉笑中溜過了；我可以說父親的一生是沒有過狂歡，同時也沒有過憂患。</p>
<p>父親是在一個冬天的晚上，拋棄了他妻女離開了這個世界，那時我還是一個六歲的小孩，眼看着父親的僵直的遺體，却不曾感到半點的悲痛，後來還是見　　　　　的哀　　　遞發　我　　的眼淚。</p>
<p>母親自從經過這一番過度的悲傷，身體便漸漸地瘦弱下來了。以前她對我的愛護，因爲有了父親成天的靠在我的身傍，在表面上看來，似乎是非常的淡薄；但從父親亡故了以後，她變得比父親在日更愛我了。她一天到晚不許我和她有一分鐘的間隔，差不多無論什麽事都要把我拉到她的身傍。在那麽兩年中，我的性情由天眞嬌憨逐漸變爲儒弱羞怯了。</p>
<p>家庭情景是一天不如一天，好像幸福之神也跟父親的亡故而亡故了；當父親亡故時，一切的喪葬費用，都是賣了幾十畝田地身祗維持下去的。往後的幾年來，　　　　　　禍交　　　逼我家的田產便一年一年的跟着易主了；母親處在這夫亡女幼的家產蕩然環境中，她那血肉的身軀便像油燈似的一天天地乾　了下去。</p>
<p>母親生命斷絕的那天，正是武昌闔城人民的生命在和死神作着最後掙扎的時候。城內的軍閥這時還在據城頑抗若城外正義的革命軍；雙方的砲火猛烈的　擊　　　　　　過　　　總有幾個　　　十着　　　　　　　　　　　　　邊緣。</p>
<p>幾十天血肉　飛的猛烈戰爭過後，武昌的城門終於開了。經過這一塲亘古未有的浩劫，城裏的景象，便像水洗過了似的蕭條；人們的臉上都帶着一層飢荒過度的幕罩，他們紛紛的携着妻兒離開這惡劣的環境。</p>
<p>在那一羣一羣逃荒的大隊中，也夾雜　了，一個　　　生命；那時　　出　的人，現在也說離了慘　　　　　走進了另一個世界。</p>
<p>這過去十年的一切所給予我的慘傷，本可不必再來撫弄，但一對着現實的遭遇，却又不免觸起兒時生活的甜密的幻影啊！</p>
<p>我會走上這條江湖生活的道路，現在想起來眞好像一塲夢景。記得我崇拜菱淸先生開始學「鑑人術」是在民國十六年問，介紹人就是把我從武昌帶出的那　　　　拜師　那天，我還　　是一個十一歲的孩子，那時不要說是不懂學習「鑑人術」是怎樣一回事，就連吃飯穿衣的日常生活也還得　淸先生護持的。</p>
<p>因爲　淸先生有己沒有孩子，所以我才能以學生的關係而享受子女的待遇；她對於我是和她自己養的一樣的寶貴，她給我受教育，造成我學習「鑑人術」的基礎。</p>
<p>自前年起，我開始「行道」。這兩年來，我　有　開　工　　因此聞名而來找我看相的人就一天夫地多了；從早上十點鐘到深夜十二點鐘我很少有機會休息。在每天十二小時的看相時間中，大概總有十個以上的顧客。在這許多顧客</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>中，當然是有不少的懷着疑難問題來請求决斷：但是以看相爲由而別具用心的人却也不是絕對沒有的。</p>
<p>說起這看相的職業，在一般不明白內情的人，總以爲是進益豐富的自由生活者；其實陰暗面的苦況却是說出來也不會使人相信的，尤其是談到我們的收入，那更是呌人頭痛的一個問題。一次看相的代價是兩元，假如一夭有十個顧客就有二十元的收入，這在一般的女子職業中自然是難得有這麽大的酬報。但是我們進賬雖大，支出却也不少。住在旅館裏的房間是一天兩元，另外還有廣吿，傳單和生活的費用，每天至少要花去十餘元，到了每月底結算起，有時章沒有十元可以餘刺的。</p>
<p>談到登廣吿的問題，却記起一椿有趣的事情來。有一次，我的照相廣吿在申新兩報登出後的第二天就有不少的人打電話問我，爲什麽登廣吿同時要把自己的照相刊出來。我爲了這樣一個問題却躇躊了半天，後來終於這樣的答覆他們說：「我登這張照片並沒有別的用意，不過我們是個江湖的自由職業者，爲了要使別人容易聽識起見，所以才把那張小照連帶的登了出來。如果一定要說是別有用意，那麽有許多電影明星還把自己的照片供給人家去賣錢，又爲的是什麼呢？」</p>
<p>那般打電話的人沒有話說，就把電話機掛了；但是接着幾天裏來找我看相的人，大半是「醉翁之意不在酒」的靑年。我的「太先生」釣鱉客，後來又替換了一張廣吿樣子；那張廣告上面是畫的一副人體的枯骨標本，並且在那底下還寫上了這樣一段話：「這一副枯骨，是往何人見了也不喜歡的，但是我紅梅如經了X光一照，也和這副枯骨沒有兩樣。我的志願是要替人家决斷窮通禍福，並不是籍我的色相來做騙人的幌子……」</p>
<p>這張廣吿登出沒有幾天，所有來看相的顧客便都是爲看相而看相的；這樁事實給予我的經騐，似乎又覺得這社會雖是那麼殘酷，但是，祇要你有方法，還是可以把牠改變過來的啊。</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3 id="c202">指導員 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 吳林</p>
<p>我因爲朋友的介紹，曾在河南的西邊陝州地方作過一番隴海鐵路工會陝州分會的指導員。在我沒有「走馬上任」之前，曾在鄭州洛陽等地看到過那些鐵路上段長監工們所住的漂亮的洋房，也曾看到過這些地方的鐵路工會的並不很壤的會所，所以在我的想像中，陝州分會的房子一定不是很壞的。但是，當我到達陝州，由分會的一個常務委員引着走到工會門口時，却使我幾乎不敢相信自己的眼睛；掛着工會牌子的並不是一所房屋，而是一個頗大的士洞！我站在這土洞的門口，仰起頭來仔細一看，我的老天，在洞的上面有一個丈把高的土崖，製着約有三四分寬的一條大縫，那樣子是快要塌下了啊！當下我是呆住了，不敢進去，但是那位常務委員却說：</p>
<p>「這就是工會，請進去！」</p>
<p>旣來了，還有什麽辦法呢？我想了一下，便冒着絕大的危險决心地走進去了。</p>
<p>說來恐怕你不會相信，就在那樣的土洞裏，安放了一張很大的長方形的餐桌，一張頭號大的寫字台，還有七八把椅子；兩面的圓斜的壁上是掛滿了什麽「天下爲公」的布帳之類；洞的裏面一層是臥室，放着兩架床舖；洞口雖不很寬，兩旁當然也沒有窗戶，但光綫却很充足，就是洞的裏面一層也不怎樣黑暗；如果我沒有在外面看到這是一個土洞時，那是會要把牠認爲是一個並不很壞的什麽辦公爲的。</p>
<p>我和那位常務委員在餐桌旁邊坐下，一個大概有二十歲的靑年聽差倒了兩盃茶來，於是那位常務委員便指着我向他說；</p>
<p>「這是張指導員，總會特派來的，你以後要聽他吩咐！」</p>
<p>我們談了一些這裏工會的情形後，那位常務委員便辭出走了。這裏剩下的只有我和那個靑年聽差兩人。因爲空氣很寂靜，使我又想起了這個土洞來。我不知道爲什麽工會不設在一所房子裏，一定要打這麽大一個土洞來做會所。於是我問那個靑年聽差，據他說：這土洞並不是新打的，已經是有三四年的歷史了；這裏的人，在城外的除鐵路上的站長監工們外，大半都是住在這樣的土洞裏過活的，並不僅是工會才設在土洞裏；而且這土洞還有牠的特別好處，就是冬天暖和夏天涼快，所以有些人還情願住土洞，不住房子。這的確是我從未聽到過的奇聞。</p>
<p>晚上，我正要脫衣睡覺的時候，忽然聽到一陣汽笛聲，由西開來了一趟火車，正從我住的土洞上面的鐵道上經過，整個土洞都被震動了，洞頂上的泥土也沙沙地掉了下來，嚇得我魂飛魄散，本能地一下跑了出來，看着土洞上面的那條裂縫似乎是漸漸地擴大起來了，「哎呀，快要塌下來了啊！」我不禁這樣呌着。但是那個靑年聽差却在洞裏笑、慢慢也走出來向我說；</p>
<p>「張先生，不要怕！洞是不會塌下來的。你看，這些人家不都是住的洞子嗎？」他甩手指羞住在我們兩旁的人家。</p>
<p>火車是早已過去了，土洞上面的縫還是和先前一樣，並沒有擴大，看來似乎還不會馬上就塌下來。於是我才定了神，又重復走進去。心裏雖還在忐忑的跳，恐怕今晚上就會被活埋在這士洞裏，但旣來了，又有什麼辦法呢？只得聽天由命，在這裏暫時地住下去了。</p>
<p>我的薪水是每月三十三元。這錢是從什麽地方來的呢？漸愧得很！工會的一切開支和我的薪水都是工友們出的。依據總會的規定，在工友們每月的收入中抽出百分之一·五來作爲各分會的費用。就是說每月有十元工資的工人，便要拿出一角五分給工會。因此，我的主要工作便是督促工人們按月繳費。在初去一兩月的時期內，收會費還不因難，一到期各處的工人們便把會費繳來了。但後來就漸漸地發生了問題，有的甚至幾個月不繳會費。對於這些不按期繳費的工人，在附近的倒還可以去要，惟有對於澠池觀音堂等地的鐵路工人却沒有辦法！他們離陝州有一兩百里地，是不能常去向他們討會費的。所以，後來我也就馬馬虎虎，那些實在繳不出會費的也就算了。好在工會的經費還可維持，不致有太的問題發生。</p>
<p>工人門常常發生衝突，只要是他們私下不能和解的，便到土洞裏來「吿狀」。這件事情是最難辦的。因爲那些工人都很直率，你在評論他們的衝突時，不能採用外交方式去向他們兩面說好，那是會要引起他們說你沒有魄力，不公正的；你必須明白地指出他們誰是誰非，才會使他們心服，說你是大公無私的。然而要判別他們的是非却不容易，倘若一旦弄錯了，那甚至有被他們罵爲「糊塗混蛋」的可能。不過，我還算是「有才幹」的人，處理過好幾次工人們的糾紛都沒有什麼大錯。所以他們對我還算好，只要有空便跑到土洞裏來和我談「三國」「水滸」，說東話西，或下象棋。有時他們還約我去飲上兩杯白乾，大大地歡樂一場。</p>
<p>這樣一來，我雖然是住在從未住過的土洞裏，成爲了「穴居野處」的野蠻人，但生活倒也不感到寂寞。只是一點使人不甚開心，卽每當火車在土洞上面駛過時，這洞子便要大大地震動起來，洞頂上的泥土也要沙沙地往下降落，使你卽刻發生「要被活埋在洞中」的恐怖。我記得，一天晚上，下了整夜的大雪，次晨起來，雪在洞外積起了一兩尺高，洞頂上也積了很厚的雪，那位靑年聽差走出門去看了一陣說：「好大的雪！下大雪，洞子便危險！不過咱們這洞還不怕！……；」「下大雪，洞子便危險！」我聽了這個警吿之後，不禁一顆小心又忐忑地跳了起來。我想，我還沒有享受人生的幸福，還沒有盡完我的責任，要是被活埋在這土洞子裏，那是太不值得了。——這樣的越想越恐怖，越想越心慌，好像覺得洞子馬上就要塌下似的，於是便急忙地收拾行李，决心離開這個危險的境地。當我乘着火車東返的時候，我心中還在那麽想着：那個土洞塌下來了嗎？那位靑年聽差已被活埋了嗎？分住在那兒的土洞中的人家還很平安嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c203">在文學上的古典主義 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 質生</p>
<p>自來中國的一部分文學研究者，對於過去歐洲的文學思潮，都是在一個錯誤的成見下解釋的？這個錯誤的成見，便是站在形式主義的立場，依據「古血」與「浪漫」這幾個字眼，以爲「古與」是封建的特質，「浪漫」則是市民的本性，因而說古典主義是封建貴族的意識的反映，浪漫主義則是新興市民的文學思潮。在一九三〇年以前，這個錯誤的成見，好像天經地義的眞理樣，只要一討論到過去歐洲的文學思潮，人們就公式似的地把這成見表現出來：同時對此也少有人提出疑問。及至弗里契的「歐洲文學發達史」被介紹到中國來時，才有一些人放棄了那種錯誤的成見，接受了弗里契的理論；但死抱着那種錯誤的成見不放的也還大有人在。不久以前，葉靑先生在「世界文學」創刊號上因爲武斷了古典主義是封建的，而被人理論地指出其錯誤，直到現在還未見什麼回答；這是大家知道的。不過以葉君那樣的人犯如此的錯誤，尙不足怪；最使人驚異的是有些新的文學研究者，指導一般靑年學習的文學理論家，直到現在都還在那種成見支配之下，說古典主義是封建的。譬如，辛人先生在其「兩種不同的浪漫主義」中，雖然正確地闡明了浪漫主義，但同時却依然在那種成見支配之下，</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>說古典主義是「封建制度的藝術形式」。又如，尹庚先生在「讀書生活」上，不僅說古典主義是封建的；同時更說「一直從前的時代都是封建社會」（見「讀書生活」一卷七期尹庚君的「寫些什麽？怎樣的寫？」）。由於這些事實，我們覺得現在還有討論古典主義所代表的究竟是什麽社會意識這問題的必要。</p>
<p>首先，在研究近代歐洲文學思潮時，我們必須理解文藝復興運動，因為這運動是由於中世紀的封建社會之崩潰，商業資本主義的發展所引出來的；如果要考究近代市民的成長過程，那便非理解文藝復興運動不可，這運動是近代市民走上歷史的舞臺，努力完成其歷史的任務之開始。文學是社會的產物，某一時代出現的佔有支配地位而又正在發展的文學思潮，必然是在那時代中佔有支配地位的正在向前發展的社會層之意識的反映。在文藝復興時代，中世紀的封建社會已經崩潰，社會的性質已是商業資本主義了，商業市民在任何方面都佔有了支配地位，在文化上當然也是一樣；所以文藝復興期的文化，文學，是商業資本主義的文化，文學，不是封建的文化，文學，此種文化，文學乃是近代文化，文學之淵源；自來一般學者在研究近代文明的發展，近代文藝思潮時，都從文藝復興開始，這並不是偶然的。</p>
<p>古典主義乃是隨著文藝復興運動而興起的文學思潮，即是由商業資本主義之向前發展所引發出來的文學思潮。事實上，在十七世紀的歐洲，由於商業資本主義之發展，成長中的市民爲了貿易上的便利，對於封建割據的政體當然極力反對；他們所急於要求的，乃是強有力的中央集權的政體，於是在當時歐洲有些國家中便出現了絕對主義的君主獨裁政治。此中成長中的市民的要求在文學上反映出來的，便是重理性，守紀律，反對新奇，描寫一般的人性的，也可說是絕對主義的古典主義。所以弗里契認為古典主義是成長中的市民的世界觀的反映。詩人波亞羅在其被稱為「古典主義的教科書」的「詩學」中不僅要作家「用理性的眼光來觀察人類的本性」，而且主張尊重現實與真理，主張「真理之外沒有美，衹有真理值得愛好」，這樣的見解，顯然不是抱著神學的沒落的封建貴族所具有的，而是成長中的市民意識的表現；說古典主義是對封建意識之反映者，顯然是與事實不合的錯誤之見。</p>
<p>如果我們考究幾個偉大的古典作家在其作品中所表現的社會意識時，那問題就更加容易明白了。第一個古典主義的作家高乃衣便是努力攻擊封建社會，服務于成長中的市民的，拉辛則是高乃衣的繼承者，也同樣是市民的文學上的代表；老巴爾紮克在其描寫羅馬市民時，更作了這樣的讚揚：「他不知道民族的羈絆，也不知道個人的傾向。他與虛榮及貪慾是無緣的。他與其和暴虐共分權利，不如消滅之為善。在他的身上，有英雄的勇氣和他的顔面上所捺着的偉大的刻印存在着。」；最後是偉大的喜劇創造者莫利哀，他在他的劇作中曾努力再養了「那鎮壓了強大的封建領主們的國王」，他把封建貴族描寫為「傲慢的」，「冷酷的」，「虛偽的」，「不道德的」人物，他借着農民的口向貴族抗議道：「你以為只要你是一個貴族，便能在我們的地方自由地勾引我們的妻子麼？」同時，他更利用貴族的僕人來痛駡貴族為犬，為惡魔。（請參看弗里契著的「歐洲文學發達史」第三章）——這樣，倘若人們不能否認這些事實，不能否認高乃衣，拉辛及莫利哀等在其作品中所表現的成長中的市民的意識，不是封建思想，那麼，說古典主義是「封建制度的藝術形式」，便是對於歷史的誤解的不合理的說法。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要特別喚起人們對於文藝復興以後的歐洲社會情形，文化狀況的注意。我們知道，文藝復興以後的歐洲社會是商業資本主義正在向前發展的社會，這時的文化特徵是絕對主義，人文主義，自然主義，古典主義；古典主義是絕對主義，人文主義乃至自然主義相結合着的。如果說古典主義是封建的，那麼，絕對主義，人文主義乃至自然主義也是封建的了，但任何科學的歷史家也不會把文藝復興以後的絕對主義與人文主義及自然主義當作封建的東西看待。自然，在我們說過的古典主義是成長中的市民的世界觀之反映那句話中的「市民」，並不是現存的企業家，銀行家，而是與希臘羅馬時代的市民相類似同時又較之更進步的商業市民；但不管怎樣，商業市民也是市民，總不是封建主，因而說表現商業市民的意識的古典主義是封建的這句話依然不對。同時，如果我們承認了文藝復興與以後的商業市民較希臘羅馬時代的更要進步，那麼，反映了他們之世界觀的文藝復興以後的古典主義便不是簡單地希臘羅馬時代的古典文學之復活，而是其更進一步的發展；也就是近代市民文學發展過程中的起初的一個階段。人們之所以把古典主義當作封建的文學思潮來看待者，乃是因其不理解文藝復興為何事的緣故，乃是因其不理解文藝復興以後的歐洲社會情形，文化狀況及古典主義之本體的緣故。</p>

<h3 id="c204">讀了「現代」「革新號」之後 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 歐任政</p>
<p>最近出版的「現代」六卷二期，在他們自己是由文藝雜誌改為文化雜誌的革新，在整個雜誌的內容上看，確有革新味。他們能夠抓住讀者底心，有把握着現實的論評，也有一般讀者渴望着的深刻的理論底淺近的解釋。</p>
<p>「現代論壇」中的短評，如馥泉的「手頭字運動」「一折六扣書」（今年不是翻譯年，應該是一折六扣年）「讀經救國」，少問的「目前中國爲什麽沒有偉大的批評家　走入牛角尖端的幽默」　這些目前文化界上的重要論題，他們都把握住，而且給與了深　的批判。</p>
<p>在政治經濟文化的論文中，唯明的「從法意妥協到倫敦協定」，在說明了這兩大事件底經過及內容之後加以論述，抓住了歐洲各帝國主義目前有暫時的及相當的和緩，而這和緩是在反蘇俄的一致之下成功的結論。錢澤夫的「現階段世界經濟恐慌的特性」，指摘出目前經濟恐慌的所謂「好轉」，只是因了「軍事工業」之發展，並不是人民的貧困不復存在了。漆琪生的「中國國民經濟發展的核心問題」　是檢討獨立評論的論　的，他批評陶希聖　　景超，梁漱溟，高踐四，鄭林莊等的主張，挑糞輪系，而主張以復興農村為核心，但只是批評，還　有看到他自己的具體的主張。傅逸生的「中國出版界到何處去」，從社會的變遷上，分析中國的出版界，並指摘出了將來的動向。</p>
<p>「通俗學術講座」中，少問的「文藝作品底價值問題」，我認為是最好的一篇，而王特夫的「電子論導出的世界觀」是最重要的一篇。前者綜合地論究內容與形式之關於文藝作品的價值，分析明確，論列周至。後者，因為在中國文化界上，是把自然科學離開了社會來觀察的，現在，他竟把電子論與世界觀揉合在一起了。</p>
<p>幾篇「隨筆」使讀者在用　　力讀了一些論文之後，鬆了一口氣，而且作者又是郁達夫，徐蔚南，陳子展，趙景深等老作家。</p>
<p>手頭字字彙，這個雜誌排得最好，如「太白」把字彙排成兩起，檢閱殊不便，這裏的，可以撕下來放在手邊檢閱。</p>
<p>「作家論」的王集叢的「梁實秋論」，是一篇用力的論文，他把梁實秋層層剝繭地剝了一個精光，暴露了梁教授等之所謂人文主義是怎樣的一個東西。但少了兩張梁實秋和白璧德的照片（因為他們很注意插圖，這裏，實是不可少的）。</p>
<p>兩篇創作，陳數旬似所屬新進作家，但也在這裏發表的「飯攤的悲劇」，在暴露了農民底「亂轉業」及亂轉業以後的仍無辦法之外，又寫出了窮人對於收租人的不平，並且說出了「老子同你拚命」，手法上也很可以，實是有望的作者。</p>
<p>「書報評論」中的三篇，李華卿的「介紹中國大學生日記」，題目最不使人注意，而內容却是値得注意的。他並不是在介紹一部書，而是在作文藝論。慧先的「先秦經籍考底胡譯」，讀了很痛快，這種譯品虧譯者有如此之厚臉皮來出版，也會有這種不負責任的書局替出版。</p>
<p>「婦女問題」中的執筆者碧遙，碧雲，似常為「女聲」週刊及「婦女園地」執筆的女作家，我覺得她們所談的問題，應該更現實點才行，有許多現實的婦女問題，要女作家自己來說話才行咧。</p>
<p>「青年生活導引」，態度很愼重，對於青年學子很有利益的文章。</p>
<p>文化界消息很豐富，這是一個小特色，很能逗引人去看的。</p>
<p>但是我有好幾點不滿意處。（一）照「革新號」實價三角，平常定價二角來看，將來篇幅要縮小三分之一，這種綜合的文化雜誌，再縮小來，便得減少幾部分，便難免使讀者失望。（二）封面紙太薄了，固然不必如「人間世」那麼奢侈，但是為保存討，也得厚一點。（三）排列方面，太省紙張，各長文應另起一面，各欄應另起一頁，不然，太小家氣了。辦一個大雜誌，要有一個大魄力，如此內容的雜誌，讀者自然會蜂踴地來的。（四）內容方面，尚有一些重要的現實問題，希望編者注意到，而提出來的論列。這幾點，不知「現代」編者及出版者能虛懷若谷地容納一得之愚否？</p>

<h3 id="c205">孔子聖地 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 常清</p>
<p>火　　　　　正好要通中間一段的時候，曲阜車站就到了。準備到曲阜去觀光的遊客，下曲阜車站時，照例是首先打聽：「孔廟，孔陵在　　？」</p>
<p>山東老鄉們會懇切地告訴你說：「不在這裡！離此還有十八裡地。由車站往東，轉彎過去，曲阜縣城到了，你便知道的。」</p>
<p>我們初次到曲阜的生客，從這裏算是打着路線的方向了。我們依照當地交　　　　　從車站向東走到大路上，各雇一輛轎車，　定價錢八毛大洋。於是騾子拉着轎車，顚簸震盪地被車夫驅馳着。我們領略這種封建式的風味在旅程中，愈加理想着所謂孔子聖地的古景　色　這時，心理上起着很　　的　　切盼望着瞻仰聖地的風光。穿過兩處村莊後，我喊着說：「呵！看得見了。遠遠地樹林頂　　邊，有兩　黃色屋頂。　綠色深黝的村落間露着那莊嚴偉大的建築：這不用說是曲阜縣的大成殿吧？」我一邊猜想，一邊問車夫。車夫說：「是的，從這裏望過去看見的黃色屋　是孔廟的大成殿。那兩幢大房子都是張宗昌督辦花錢裝修起來的。後面的一座是孔子夫人的神位；前面的是大成殿　」</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>騾車走得很快，再前進一個村莊，又看見了曲阜的城垣：相形之下，愈顯得孔廟的雄壯。單看城墻之橫亘的形式，已可以推測到曲阜至少是第一二等的縣城了但是，若從孔廟的大成殿方面看下去，一望就可知道整個曲阜縣城都好像是爲了孔廟而裝璜上去似的。骡車再穿過一個村莊後，我又问車夫；孔陵在那兒呢？』車夫說：『喂！還沒看見嗎？在城外—北門外，這裏望過去的—二里地的那個大林園便是。你看那邊很長的墻垣吧！裏面埋着孔家歷代的墳墓；孔子的陵墓就在那裏而……很可以去逛逛。』</p>
<p>在黃土大路上顛簸着，約模有一個鐘頭的途程。剎那間，我們的骡車已經到達縣城了。入城下車後，首先到縣政府去拜望一位朋友。在十二點鐘的時候，我們一同去逛孔廟。</p>
<p>從縣政府出來，穿過幾個轉灣的街口，崎嶇不平的街道走盡頭的地方，便是曲阜縣的南門。由南門轉角，便是一條平坦的巷道，中間豎立着『闕里』兩個大字的牌坊。『呵！這就是孔子的故里吧！現在還有什麽殘留的古跡嗎？」我問着。一位旅居曲阜多年的朋友說：『沒有什麽。就是剛才看見的牌坊也還是淸朝末年修建的。前面大門進去便是孔廟了。』說若我們走進了孔廟的大門。</p>
<p>孔廟宏大雄壯。內有古樹甚多，與重疊曲折的亭廊相陣列於四週，確實比其他許多的文廟要偉大得多。從北至南，由大成殿起，一直到大門爲止，橫斷曲阜城爲東西兩個部分。廟內有很多的碑石，多係歷代帝王名士所留的字跡。在大成殿前有『杏壇』名跡，這是一個石碑，有一所寬大的樓閣亭臺籠罩着，面前置有一個古鼎，四圍參雜着一些古樹。遊覽此地的人多半愛到這裏攝影留紀念。此外，特別值得記憶的，便是大成殿了。大成殿的建築，確是宏偉，不亞於北平淸宮的「太和殿』。殿內只有孔子　　一　，　常嚴　。左右　有　　　品及古樂，上浮灰　頗厚。殿前排列着十條雕龍的石柱，共大過於三尺直徑。石的質地細而堅，遊人多往撫摩環抱，其花樣　光澤也很美觀可愛。鏽說有西人曾以極大之價誘賣，但爲孔氏後裔所拒絕，故仍保存至今。這當然是孔廟裏極有藝術價值的珍貴品了。</p>
<p>逛完孔廟以後，我們出城到孔陵。從北門外起直到孔陵的一條大路，很是寬敞整齊，沿途都有古柏排列着。孔陵內的樹木更多，惜已砍伐過半，其新植者亦尙未成林。據說是由於孔家後人的生活困難，在不得已中伐賈了不少。孔陵裏的房屋比較簡單。裏面除了重疊陳列着的歷代碑誌而外，有子貢手植的槍樹古跡。這是一株高約丈餘，粗約兩尺的乾枯木材，直立於地上，罩以小屋，四圍是玻璃實，從窗上可以直看進去。在不知道道是古跡的人，往往錯認爲警察看守所，以爲那裏面是守衛孔陵的園丁！哩！從檜樹以北約數百步地，便是孔子陵墓。墓前有簡單的碑石，可是已風化得看不淸楚了。墓堆並不很大，四面栽種有靑木樹及其他雜樹，遠近都是孔氏後人的墳墓林立其間，但都荒蕪得可怕。</p>
<p>遊完了孔陵以後，我們承縣政府的介紹，參觀孔廟西旁的衍聖公府。衍聖公名孔德成，他是孔子七十二代的嫡裔</p>
<p>我們在公府門口等候有二十分鐘的光景，衍聖公府的招待員出來領我們參　公府內　。除了　　　列出來的一　孔氏一　跡物品之外，又到花園裏去逛了一遭。　裏的山石花草雖然不錯，但可惜太不整飭了。各處看了一下之後，我　被引到客　裏坐下。這時，行　　公被他的老師引出來了。我們看他的舉此很莊嚴。據說他的年齡還不到十六歲，但他的風度却是足够知書識禮的。我們同路去參觀的朋友吿訴我們說，曲阜的人都稱他爲『活聖人』。我們由招待員一一介紹後，有一位朋友就開始向衍聖公問他生活如何，求學興趣如何等等的問題，不知何故，竟不蒙回答。但是，立刻間，那位伴同出來的老師就開口說：「衍聖公現正在求學時期，對於來賓的詢問恐不能詳盡答覆，我可以酌量奉答一二。衍聖公除讀聖人書卷之外，也學英文數理化各科。公府內以衍聖公爲主體，管理財務則有管事；此外，關於醫藥，教書及管理孔廟孔陵亦均有專人各司其事……」</p>
<p>寒暄了一陣之後，我們吿辭出衍聖公府。據當地人說：『孔家的田地約佔曲阜縣的四分之三；雖然照例不上糧的，只因孔氏八府後人不大過問產業業，現在有許多佃戶都很難淸理出頭緒來。由於同樣情形，衍聖公的經濟也是很困難的。他的全部財產，單是供給各部員司及孔廟孔陵的園丁每月開銷都還不够。人們都担心着：不知道孔族要在將來那一年才有發旺的（發財的意思）希望咧？」</p>

<p>— 蟄</p>
<p>剛過了月底的初一日，下午一時四十分，我踅進靜安寺路郵局。</p>
<p>剛推開那扇厚重的玻窗，卽聽得轟轟響的，見櫃台口前擠滿了人。我剛佔到了一席地，背後面又壓上一堆人肉來。怎麽的，今天會有這麽多人在這裏等着匯寄銀錢的？</p>
<p>在我右邊，有兩個女人　噥着。那一個，滿臉皺紋，兩鬢斑白，嘴巴成了一個陷洞，膩膩的白眼污沾住了眼角。她把嘴唇一癟一癟的，向她旁邊的另一年輕女人談着正經，聲音都是安徽口音。</p>
<p>我把匯單寫好了，兩肘擱在櫃子上，望望這兩個女人，我注意她們的裝束，料定她們都是農村來的忠厚良民。不知怎麼的，那老女人也注意到了她旁邊的我了，又好似她從我的服飾上知道我還是個識字的人，突然卑謙地在皺皮的臉蛋上露出恭敬的笑，一隻手顫巍巍地擎着她的那張匯單，送到我面前，恭敬的說：</p>
<p>「先生，」她點着頭笑着。「請—噯噯先生，這信，噯，老黃是不是寫的安徽無爲縣××鎮……對不起先生！」</p>
<p>她說的老黃大概是她帮傭的那主人的同事吧，也許是主人的包車夫吧，也許是什麽，她也許昨天得了工錢啦，今天就一古腦兒寄回家去，她不用一　個錢；家，大概是渴望着海邊的上海，有錢寄回去吧，農村是破產啦，這老女人也許正因爲農村破產了才趕到上海的，—我想羞，就拿到她的匯單和信封讀了。上面寫的沒有錯，是「無爲縣××鎮××寶號—」只是沒有寫上省名，我想也許寫了省名可更淸楚一點，我就問她：</p>
<p>「無爲縣是不是在安徽？」</p>
<p>「是，是—老太婆滿臉是恭敬的卑謙的笑。</p>
<p>「哦，那麽我給你加上安徽兩個字吧，上面不寫有安徽。」</p>
<p>「啊，老黃寫錯了嗎？啊啊，怎麼的，怎麽的，錯了怎麽辦呢？洋錢—」她驚惶得沒血色的皺皮臉上泛了靑色。</p>
<p>「沒有錯，老奶奶，他沒有錯，無爲縣是對的，我說上面再加安徽兩字更淸楚點。」我微笑着，隨卽用自來水筆替他在墨筆字上端添了藍色的「安徽」兩字。旁觀的人，哄然笑了。</p>
<p>她感激地，眼眶流了淚水，點着頭，「謝謝，呵，先生，謝謝謝謝。」</p>
<p>她不斷的道着謝，我倒有點不好意思了，我不知道怎麼她會這樣的感激我呢，我並沒有大的恩惠給她。</p>
<p>玻窗外仍舊繼續有人進來，有的僅僅買幾分郵花就走了，有的走上包裏櫃打包去了，只有匯寄櫃前仍擠滿了人。照郵局章程，二點鐘才開始匯寄，還差二十分鐘。可是這時已擠滿人。老太婆嚕囌着，灰呢帽伏在櫃上寫匯票，碧眼的洋女人，同售郵票的郵務員打着「洋涇浜。</p>
<p>那老女人又將那匯單給旁邊的那商人模樣的人看去了，老女人說：</p>
<p>「剛剛那位好先生替我加的，」她指着藍色的字。「先生，是這樣寫嗎？老黃眞糊塗，先生！」</p>
<p>那瓜皮帽點了一點，「不錯！」</p>
<p>於是老太婆又朝向我這邊來：「先生，好先生，眞謝謝你。喀嘻嘻，先生，我家裏還有個二歲的小孫兒呢，你想，本來煩不着我老太婆趕到上海來作活，可是，先生，先生，小三子的媽，先生，我的媳婦兒，人是滿人強馬壯的，不過，她要在家管孩子呢！」</p>
<p>她嘮嘮叨叨地，訴說着，我靜靜的聽她訴說，我由微笑而轉爲嚴肅，眼前展開了一個荒漠的農村的幕，那些人爲着活命，東奔西馳，我敬佩着這個老女人「生的興趣」，我悲哀着這個瘦骨嶙峋的老女人的命運！</p>
<p>二點鐘了，老女人將兩個雪白的銀元，交給郵務員，噹的，丟在抽屜裏，老女人拿着紙條塞進信封去，帶着滿面歡容走出人堆。</p>
<p>「謝謝，先生，哦，謝謝謝謝！」</p>
<p>她又這樣謝我，我想不出什麽話回答她，很侷促地。我也做完了匯欵的手續，離開櫃臺，這時是二時十分。郵局半小時，我上了一課社會學課和人生哲學課。</p>
<p>走出那扇厚重的門，我看見了那安徽某一角鄉村中那幾個苦臉上浮起的歡笑。我也看到我的媽媽歡笑的臉，我也看到無數無數農村中抬着饑餓的眼翹望着海邊飛去的金錢，然而多數仍在失望中恢復了一張張難看的苦臉。</p>
<p>一串悲苦人頭的滾動。腦袋發了昏。</p>

<p>一九一四年，在德俄國境附近有可以觀測的全部日蝕，愛氏此時很希望自己的學說得到證明，但這年因爲大戰爆發，德國觀測隊成爲了俄國的俘虜，於是愛氏的機會失去。一九一八年里茲克天文台所試騐的，也終於失敗。英國的天文學者愛丁頓是相對論的研究者，一九一七年他把其解說發表了；同年三月以英國的亞斯托羅馬，羅亞爾的提議，因爲一九一九年五月的全部日蝕觀測，在皇家學會與皇家天文學會的聯合會上準備進行，顧慮氣候的結果，决定派遣觀測隊分赴在全部日蝕綫上的兩個地方去。愛丁頓參加在阿非利加隊中，在日蝕的一天，阿非利加方面是晴天，於是他們照了幾張照片，這是顯出了愛因斯坦效果之存在的。另外一隊也遇到了晴天，在那兒的大小兩台的望遠鏡的攝影之結果，小的方面是可信用的，但也明白地實證了愛因斯坦效果。一九一九年十一月六日，在倫敦的皇家學會及皇家天文學會的聯合會上的報吿，顯出示了愛因斯坦的法則比較牛頓的更被實證了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c214">悼阮玲玉女士 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>我們不能不以最大的悲痛來哀吊阮玲玉女士，當艾霞死後的一週年的現在，當勞働婦女解放的一九三五年的三八節這一天，又得著了她的死耗的時候。</p>
<p>一點也不誇大的說，阮玲玉女士的死，不是他個人的損失，也不是她的家屬或者某一部份認得損失，而是整個的中國電影的損失。這因為她是一個天才的演員。從她在聯華公司第一部份作品而且也是她開始被人們認識的作品「故都春夢」，以後是「野草開花」，「戀愛與義務」，「一剪梅」，「梅花泣血記」，「玉堂春」，「續故都春夢」，「三個摩登女性」，「城市之夜」，「小玩意」，「歸來」，「人生」，「神女」，一直到最後的「新女性」，（尚有「國風」未攝竣。）就她的演技來說，可以說沒有一部不表現他的演技之優秀。當然，我們不想現在來檢討她的每一部作品，可是一般地說，她對於中國電影留下了不少成績。特別是在作為中國電影第一部走向新的階段的「三個摩登女性」，她裝扮了一個自己毫無生活經驗的工作，以及在「城市之夜」中，在「神女」中，在「新女性」中，都表現了她奇特的天才。然而現在她是死了，我們再也不能看到她的新作品了。這一有著偉大前途的天才女伶啊！我們不能不為中國電影的損失而惋惜！</p>
<p>因為她的自殺而死，人們不會忘懷她在「新女性」中是扮裝了一個因生活和意志的矛盾；以至於衝社會所給與她的苦悶而自殺的小有產者的女性，因而詛咒「新女性」中自殺的「啟示」，對於她，對於整個的社會，有著不良的教唆。同時另一方面，人們也不會忽視連日來各報所刊載的，關於足以損害她的名譽的訟事。但是當我們深入「新女性」觀察一番後，「新女性」決不是啟示女人自殺，相反的劇作者是反對自殺的；這從女工阿英口中流露出劇作者的本意。反對自殺的作為劇的主題，正是劇作者成功的一點。同時據記者所調查得來的，阮玲玉遠在訟事發生之前，便買了安眠藥片半打之多，當時聯華二廠的諸人曾經通知阮女士的母親嚴密監視的，這足以證明她的自殺動機，決不是最近才有的。那末阮玲玉爲什麽自殺的呢？是「新女性」的教唆麼？是離婚案的名譽關系麼？除此二者以外，還有一般自殺之共同原因的經濟關系麼？這在她每月收入甚　的一點上看來，當然是不能成為理由的了。</p>
<p>一般的說來，處於現階段的中國女性，在在都可以感覺到極大的痛苦使她們有慘死的可能性。特別是小有產者女性，正如「新女性」中所說的一樣，她們每日在生活與意志的矛盾中痛苦的掙扎著。而比較有自覺性的如阮玲玉之流的女性，她們因著物質的誘惑想向上爬，可是事實上又不允許她們輕便的做到。同時她們想積極的與生產大眾合流走向抗爭的道路，但在生活上有自知受不了那般殘酷的折磨。她們需要精神上的向上，但同時也要生活的向上，於是這種內心的衝突與矛盾，再不能得著解決的當中，自殺以毀滅於矛盾當中，決不是偶然的結果。更進一步說，有不少女人以嫁人為「歸宿」，但當她們在嫁人之後並不能得著真摯的愛情安慰而衹有物質的麻醉。就阮女士個人來說，由於報紙上的記載，不能不使他受著忍受不了的苦痛和刺激，所以這雖然不是她自殺的動機，不過這也是促成自殺的主要原因之一。這樣說來，阮女士是勇敢的良心主義者，爲了自身生活的嚴肅，爲了人格的尊重，爲了精神向上的幻滅，爲了要脫除苦痛和煩悶，她的自殺，對於她自己正是勇敢的表現。</p>
<p>是的，她和艾霞女士的自殺，正是中國小有產女性苦悶的表現。她們都是良心主義勇敢殉難者，然而自殺者就是勇士麼？正相反，有著自殺的勇氣，還有什麽不可幹呢？我們堅決的反對自殺。我們相信殺害阮玲玉的不是某些個人，更不是「新女性」的教唆，而其真凶乃是萬惡的社會。那末不能反抗社會的惡勢力，反而成為社會的被犧牲者，正是弱者的表現。那末她既然不能殺身成仁，即使她死而有知的話，像「新女性」中所說的一樣，她將十分後悔的了。同時，三八節的意義，對於中國婦女的影響，又是何等薄弱啊！哦！這萬惡的現社會，願千萬的巾幗丈夫，爲了爭取被壓迫女性共同的出路，以自殺的決心變為革命的行動，為多少死難的姊妹勇敢的復仇！因為阮玲玉女士死在三八節這一天，記者不能不如此大胆呐喊了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c215">評「賽車笑史」 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>6　Day　Bike　Rider　大光明</p>
<p>不是說笑話：因為目前有幾位新進的軟性紳士，在強調著電影的藝術價値的時候，即是說當他們在要求電影完全作為娛樂而出現的時候，加入他們的理論也可存在的話，我幾乎要推舉著「賽車笑史」的作者作為他們的標準導師了。</p>
<p>可不是麼？在這一影片中，所有的是噱頭，噱頭，第三個還是噱頭。喬勃朗的大嘴巴，那末大的，只要這張大嘴，已經夠使你好笑了。他曾騎自行車，騎得非常巧妙，好像在大世界看騎車表演，真夠使人們　異。而且他能在車上脫衣，脫褲子，車子輾過香蕉皮，跌跤，，這更是使軟性紳士裂開大嘴笑，如有喬勃朗的一樣。總而言之，這影片能使人們大笑，不管這些噱頭是怎樣的勉強，生硬，然而觀眾們是在戲院中大笑一陣的。那末這便是娛樂了，這便是軟性紳士們所要求的無原則的藝術價値了。</p>
<p>但是啊，假使藝術價値僅僅是如此解釋的話，假使所謂藝術的快感便是不要內容而祇要生硬的技巧堆疊的話，那末電影藝術真應當從此毀滅了。</p>
<p>誰也知道，沒有內容便沒有形式，決沒有只憑著技巧而有藝術價値的。那末什麽是「賽車笑史」的內容呢？一個青年，不管他怎樣笨拙，只要勇敢，到底可以得著美人的青睞。而且那美人是銀行家的女兒，當然女婿的發財，乃是不成問題的。於是在最後我們看到那青年携着嬌妻愛子，快樂的散步了。</p>
<p>我想是不用再加解釋的了，其庸俗空虛到如此程度，我們還有什麽可說呢？但是軟性紳士卻說內容在其次，只要求所謂快感。不過這裏的快感在觀眾記憶中也是不會留下怎樣深刻的吧？</p>
<h3 id="c216">銀幕上的幾位笑匠 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 光毅</p>
<p>笑匠為普天下所歡迎的。他們的藝術無國界，且為人人所能了解。這裏告訴你們常見的幾位笑匠小史：</p>
<p>勞萊與哈台——這對笑匠是近年來風頭最健的，他們倆是老搭檔，演出的長片短片皆有，然而多數為短片。勞萊是英國人，一八九五年生，七歲時就隨著他底父母登台演戲，十六歲到美國，二十三歲入好萊塢影界。哈台是美國人，一八九二年生，比勞萊長三歲，你別看不起他，原來他還是喬其亞大學法科的畢業生哩！他對於電影早就有特殊愛好，雖然二十二歲時始入影界。勞哈合作，始於默片，現在合演的都是聲片，均堪發噱，近作「玩意世界」，業已於上月在滬公演。</p>
<p>卓別林——這是位名聞遐邇，最受歡迎的老牌笑匠。他在一八八九年生於倫敦，他父親是英國人，母親為生於西班牙的舞女，幼年時生活極貧困，八歲時即服役於歌劇團，一九零六年隨某英國劇團赴美。一九一三年，得名導演麥克塞納Mack　sendett之提拔而入影界。他於一九三一年春間，曾漫遊歐洲，法政府特贈以榮譽軍帶。聞彼近將繼「城市之光」後，作一聲片云。</p>
<p>羅克——一八九二年生於美國尼白拉斯加州，他是早年馳名的笑匠，近來却很少作品，因為他已經是腰纏萬貫的富翁了。他爲了所主演的辱華片「不怕死」曾向我國人道歉，聲明誤會，並稱彼對於中國之文物，原甚欽佩云。</p>
<p>裴斯開登——生於美國堪薩斯州，他以善於面部表情而著名。裴妻原為腦門塔文的堂妹，後卒因不睦離婚，而與病中在醫院所認識之看護梅女士結婚。</p>
<p>威爾羅吉士——為影界的老前輩，生於一八七九年。他有了十餘年的舞台經驗后，便踏入影界，他不僅是個笑匠，而且也是著作家兼政論家哩！現任好萊塢市名譽市長。他每拍攝一片，可得十二萬五千金元。他曾來過上海，為一有趣的典型美國人。</p>
<h3 id="c217">不堪回首阮玲玉的犧牲精神 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>一個藝人的成功雖然要有天才，但是也需要努力和勇于犧牲寶有無窮的希望。像阮玲玉她對工作不但誠懇忠實，同時對於藝術上所需要於她的犧牲她也是不顧一切地做到的。在「新女性」攝製時，會有一個要她從二樓的扶梯滾到樓下的鏡頭，蔡導演的意思是打算用遠景的畫面演出，另外找一個身材和她差不多的人來代替她失足。然而阮玲玉却以為這樣未免减了戲劇的力量，若是導演答應的話，她願意親自墜樓將遠景改成中景。當然，這是導演求之不得的意外收穫，結果：是那樣美滿了，不過，阮的膝蓋却被跌破。</p>
<h3 id="c218">皇姨胡珊重登銀壇 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>電影皇后胡蝶之愛妹胡珊，久未現身銀壇，不知者以為胡珊已脫離銀壇生活，其實胡珊對電影藝術，仍銳意求進。聞吉星公司新片「方芸英」，即由胡珊主演。此劇描寫藝人生活，細膩而脫俗，藝人為藝術而奮鬥能不為利誘，不為勢屈。胡珊飾藝人方芸英，有劇中串劇等表情。全片有聲對白，並有歌唱。攝影收音由專家強生担任。昨在該公司攝影場試映，成績非常完美。聞不日將在金城大戲院公映云。</p>

<p>— 信之</p>
<p>路易聽了，這才放心坐了下來說道：「就這樣辦吧。我們到琴脫去好了……」公爵夫人聽了，連忙想阻止他，但是他嘮嘮叨叨地說道：「咳……骯髒地旅館……我們一定要住……無味的飯菜……我們一定要吃……灰塵……泥土……」夫人無法，掉過身來對著南衣大將道：「將他生擒了來，交給我」，南衣大將鞠著躬道：「不錯。將他裝在鐵籠裏帶回來」。</p>
<p>南衣大將率領了四千精兵，區和拿破崙相會，但是他沒有將拿破崙生擒。拿破崙卻將他生擒了。南衣大將被拿破崙生擒之後，匍匐在他的故主足下，將他的生命，士兵—一切都獻給了他。軍士的服從心，克過了一切。在南衣大將沒有離開巴黎之前，他還是路易十八世的忠臣，但是拿破崙是他的故主。南衣大將的榜樣，全法國的人都效法了。全發過的人都歸順了拿破崙。不到兩個禮拜，拿破崙已經進了巴黎城，又做了法蘭西的皇帝了。</p>
<p>在不魯塞爾的大本營裏威靈登公爵，急速的將已經千三的各國聯軍，重新召集起來這時候，路易和他的侄女住在琴脫，而他的侄女呢，天天加他率領了皇室的羽林軍去攻巴黎。威靈頓聽見了這個消息，星夜趕到琴脫，去見路易王，叫他不要亂動，并告訴他拿破崙正在氣盛之時，就是各國聯軍，現在亦在按兵不動，徐代良機之中。</p>
<p>威靈登的到琴脫，不止一次，但是每次他去路易的時候，這位安諾列公爵夫人總是不離左右，並且她一些也不隱藏那仇視威靈登的態度。</p>
<p>一個月，兩個月，三個月，這樣地過去，歐洲已全部在人心惶惶之中，戰神重臨天空，俯視著沙場上死傷枕藉的人而獰笑著，喪歌四起，滿山滿谷的響應者。拿破崙的軍隊出發了，他急轉直下的攻擊聯軍，要將他們驅出法國國境之外。</p>
<p>在立治蒙公爵夫人的不魯塞爾的別邸之中，年少貌美的弗蘭西斯威伯斯特動爵夫人正幫助著公爵大發請柬。公爵夫人的邸中，不久將舉行一次跳舞大會，動爵夫人替她將請柬疊好了，塞進信封裏去。但是他的首顫抖著，十次有九次塞不進去的。公爵夫看了就說道：「弗蘭西斯你這樣幫忙，越幫越忙了。你給我擱著吧。動爵夫人歎了一口氣：「卻珞蒂，你亦不能怪我。他不是馬上就要來了嗎」？</p>
<p>公爵夫人啐著她道：「呸，你這小傻子。威靈登公爵是來吃晚飯。他這麼早來做什麽」？動爵夫人道：「哦，我崇拜他……」公爵夫人道：「但是你未嘗看見過他」。動爵夫人道：「我寢室裏有他的畫像。他的那副眼睛—多麼英俊可愛啊」！公爵夫人問道：「你的丈夫是不是亦覺得他的眼睛英俊可愛呢」？動爵夫人道：「他還在君士但丁呢」。公爵夫人道：「難道他永遠在那兒的嗎」？動爵夫人又歎了一口氣道：「卻珞蒂，我求你一樁事。回頭威靈登公爵加到的時候—請你不要離開我的左右—或者我會昏倒的」。</p>
<p>公爵夫人正想回答，忽然樓上起了一陣喧騰的聲音，她們頭頂上的燈架都震動了。公爵夫人不覺喊了一聲道：「不好了。我猜威靈登已經來了。他在樓上和小孩子玩呢。」她說著，立即站了起來，奔上樓去。</p>
<p>屋子裏喧鬧的聲音更加大了，當公爵夫人開門進入的時候。大家都爬在地上，除了小孩子之外，威靈登公爵，大家成為鐵公爵的，亦在地板上爬著。公爵夫人不覺笑道：「你這種樣子，要是給邦那巴看見了倒不差」。威靈登站了起來，嬉了一張嘴道：「那再好沒有了。至少可以幫助他知道些幽默的意味」。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e38">A Retrospective on the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Russo-Japanese War <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War began on February 6, 1904. The Battle of Mukden (Liaoning) ended on March 10 of the following year. Japan, with a force of 350,000, drove the Russian army beyond North Manchuria, thus achieving final victory. In this war, the Japanese army suffered more than 40,000 casualties. The intensity of the battle and the magnitude of the sacrifice were unprecedented in Japan's foreign wars. In the blink of an eye, thirty years have passed.</p>
<p>The Japanese military, in order to recall the glory of their past victories and to encourage the people's outward expansionist sentiments, held a commemorative meeting today. They also published a booklet listing the stages of Japan's national power development, the world significance of the Russo-Japanese War, and the path to be taken in the future, thereby stimulating the Japanese people's awareness of the so-called extraordinary times. Looking back and ahead, we realize that the Russo-Japanese War was the beginning of determining the situation in East Asia today. Comparing China's current position and situation with that of thirty years ago, it seems that there is not much progress to speak of. What is past cannot be remedied, but what is to come can be pursued. Therefore, we present several points to inform the people of our country.</p>
<p>First, the location of the Russo-Japanese War was on Chinese territory, and the cause, beginning, and ultimate purpose of the war were also related to China. At that time, Japan, riding on the residual power of its victory over China, was ambitious for the Asian continent. However, its development towards the sea was blocked by the Imperial Russian fleet in the Far East, and its development on land was also hindered by the established forces of Imperial Russia in the South Manchuria area. In order to obtain its freedom of development in the East, Japan was determined to fight against Russia. Therefore, when the war broke out, the whole country was ecstatic, believing that the survival of the empire depended on this one action. The Japanese General Togo Heihachiro personally led the troops and commanded the battle. Finally, after a bloody battle of one year and three months, he destroyed the Russian power in the East. The firmness of their will to advance northward is worthy of our reflection, and their courageous spirit of resisting the enemy is indeed a model for us to emulate.</p>
<p>Second, after the war ended, the Japanese gradually began to manage Manchuria. They expanded the functions of the South Manchuria Railway Company, seized our northeast's railway construction and mine exploitation rights, and various other economic interests. Gradually, the Japanese were able to arbitrarily control things like immigration along the railway lines and police matters. Later, due to the maturity of economic and political aggression, the September 18th Incident occurred. The freezing of the dew into ice is by no means accidental. Examining historical facts, the beginning of this can be traced back to the Russo-Japanese War. The Japanese claim that the Russo-Japanese War and the Manchurian Incident have a consistent historical evolutionary significance and contain the value of transforming world history. This is indeed no exaggeration.</p>
<p>Third, after the Russo-Japanese War, Japan's national power expanded, and the pressure it exerted on China increased year by year. The revision of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the establishment of the Franco-Japanese secret agreement were all aimed at China. Japan actually controlled the activities of international financial groups in China. Moreover, the internal warlord wars in our country provided Japan with opportunities to exploit. During the European war, the pressure our country suffered became even deeper, and Japan's ambition to dominate East Asia flourished even more at this time, gradually becoming an unstoppable trend.</p>
<p>Fourth, Japan's attempt to dominate East Asia, although it suffered a considerable blow at the Washington Conference after the European War, the international relations in East Asia became even more complicated. Therefore, the competition of economic forces of the great powers in China and the invasion of our country's borders were not eased after the Washington Conference. Until today, the lost territory of our four northeastern provinces has not been recovered, and the situation of peace in East Asia is in imminent danger. Great calamities are coming, and there is no end in sight. How should we strive for self-reliance and save the crisis in the future? This is a question that the entire country, from top to bottom, should seriously reflect on today.</p>
<p>From the historical facts of the past thirty years, China and Japan have been in an unnatural relationship of oppression and being oppressed, whether in politics or economics. Is there any possibility for cooperation between China and Japan in the future? How should Japan change its attitude and means towards us in the past thirty years? If China and Japan cannot cooperate, what active preparations and sacrifices should we make to seek freedom and equality for China in the international community in the future? This is another question that we cannot help but raise to ask those who are paying attention to the issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation on the 30th anniversary of the Russo-Japanese War.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Bulgaria's Understanding with Turkey; Balkan Situation Chaotic; Yugoslavia Issues Warning; Italy Declares Neutrality; League of Nations Secretary-General's Mediation <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(London) The war clouds are slowly spreading over the Balkans, but reliable news is very scarce, so the current situation is very difficult to ascertain. Although the international panic caused by Turkey's troop build-up on the Bulgarian border has now subsided slightly, Yugoslavia is now in danger of being drawn into the vortex. According to news from Belgrade, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry firmly believes that there is no danger of international disputes arising from this, saying that Bulgaria or Turkey will never have the reckless act of interfering in the Greek rebellion. However, if any foreign country interferes, the Balkan Pact will be implemented, and Yugoslavia will send troops to assist Greece and drive out the invading foreign troops. According to Reuters from Rome, the Italian authorities stated that Italy has not assisted the Greek rebels, nor has it encouraged Bulgaria to occupy an outlet to the Aegean Sea. Italy is completely neutral and has no contact with the Greek rebel leader Venizelos. According to news from Geneva, after the Turkish and Bulgarian representatives met this morning, Bulgaria withdrew the protest letter sent to the League of Nations opposing the Turkish troop build-up in Eastern Thrace. It is heard that direct negotiations will be conducted between the two countries to seek a peaceful resolution to this matter. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The matter of Bulgaria's application to the League of Nations yesterday seems to have been formally resolved today. When League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol met with the Bulgarian representative for the second time, he decided to regard Bulgaria's memorandum as a kind of information and distribute it to the members of the League of Nations Administrative Council for reference. If the Turkish government agrees, then Turkey's declaration will also be treated in the same way. Avenol then had successive talks with the Greek and Turkish representatives, and the result has eased the overall situation. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People's minds in Europe have greatly eased today, as according to official news, the dispute between Bulgaria and Turkey has been resolved peacefully. However, the crisis of war has not completely dissipated. On the Greek side, more than 1,000 people have died in the civil war, and Turkey and Bulgaria are still stationed on the border with heavy troops, closely guarding. Bulgarian representative Antonov declared that the dispute has now been resolved, and that both Bulgaria and Turkey have expressed their willingness for peace to the League of Nations, and said that they now believe that Turkey's military actions on the border are not directed against Bulgaria. League of Nations observers said that this matter could easily have led to a major incident, and that the peaceful resolution this time was due to the exercise of pressure by the great powers. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Bulgarian representative to the League of Nations recently issued a declaration to the press, saying, "The memorandum of protest sent by Bulgaria to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol on March 7 against the concentration of Turkish troops on the Bulgarian border should be regarded as 'not received,' because Bulgaria has received various necessary mitigation measures from all sides, and therefore believes that the memorandum of March 7 need not be submitted to the League of Nations Administrative Council." According to reports, Bulgaria's decision was the result of mutual explanations between the Bulgarian and Turkish representatives through the mediation of the League of Nations Secretary-General. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu also issued a statement to the Bucharest Lador News Agency, saying that Bulgaria had no legitimate motive to submit a negotiation to the League of Nations, which is regrettable. He also said that in view of the current events in the Balkans, the unity of the signatory countries of the Balkan Consultative Pact is obvious. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol met with Bulgarian representative Andonov today and explained that it was necessary for the country's memorandum to be sent to the Turkish representative for review. Once Turkey responds, the documents of the two countries will be submitted to the League of Nations Administrative Council for research. It is heard that Avenol believes that Bulgaria's sudden submission of a memorandum yesterday was unconventional and expressed this to Andonov. International figures here also believe that the Bulgarian delegation did not fully weigh the importance of the matter beforehand. This evening, Greek representative Rafael met with Avenol to explain that Bulgaria's military measures taken on the Greek border were not only unhelpful but also dangerous. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) News from the Turkish capital states that the Balkan Pact countries, including Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Romania, are determined to limit any attempts to infringe on the territorial status quo of the Balkan Peninsula. Italian political figures believe that this is a warning to Bulgaria, so they are worried upon hearing the news, but they still firmly believe that countries like Turkey and Bulgaria are only strengthening their border defenses as a precautionary measure and have no other intentions.

<h3 id="e40">Greek Government Forces Prepare for General Offensive Against Rebels; Advance Thwarted Earlier by Snow <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Salonika, Greece: Since this morning, the weather has begun to clear. Multiple government aircraft have flown to scout the positions of the rebel army. Minister of the Army Kondylis has gone to the Struma River front line to make the final preparations for the general offensive. It is likely that the general offensive will begin within a few hours. According to reliable news, the situation on the rebel side is becoming increasingly chaotic, and most of the rebels have surrendered to the government forces one after another. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Athens: In the Greek civil war, it is heard that rebel leader Venizelos was injured and is now being transported to the port of Alexandria by destroyer. The government army's morale has been boosted by this news. Alexandria sources claim that if the rebel leader arrives here, the weapons on his ship will be disarmed and his guns will be temporarily detained. The war is still ongoing throughout Greece. Three government destroyers opened fire on Crete and bombarded the rebels in the Strymon Valley. It is heard that in the past few hours, the rebels have occupied the islands of Chios and Samos, while the central army has captured 700 rebels, 200 of whom are officers. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Athens: A Yugoslav steamship in Volos intercepted a radio message saying that a famous Greek politician, Venizelos, had been seriously injured and transported to the port of Alexandria. If this news is confirmed, the rebels will be demoralized. Although the rebels have been attacked by the government army from the sea, land, and air, they remain stubborn and unsubdued. Yesterday, Greek Army Chief General Kondylis personally commanded the army to attack the rebels in Eastern Macedonia, but the heavy snow blocked the road, making it difficult for the government army to advance for a time. Therefore, 12 bombers bombarded the enemy's position. Kondylis is confident of victory, as the government army has 80,000 troops, while the rebels only have 6,000. It is heard that the rebels are suffering from a severe food shortage and are now looting villages. According to neutral sources, after fierce fighting between the two sides, Salonika was heavily bombed by the rebels. The five warships occupied by the rebels are now nowhere to be seen. It is heard that they have sailed to the vicinity of the island of Cyclades in the Aegean Sea. Four government warships have sailed out to prevent enemy ships from approaching the area within the firing range of Athens. Residents of the capital are fearful of being bombed by enemy ships and are moving to safer rural areas. The port of Piraeus in Athens is currently reinforcing its defenses day and night to prevent enemy ships from invading.</p>
<p>Greek Army Chief General Kondylis issued a communiqué stating that rain and snow were blocking the road and floods were rampant, causing the government army to fail to cross the Strymon River. The situation of the rebels is quite pitiful. Twenty aircraft dropped bombs on the enemy troops assembled in Serres. The local station was also the target of aerial bombardment. Aircraft reconnoitered the situation in Serres, and a large part of the area is now flooded. Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris admitted today while meeting guests here that the government army was hindered by the severe weather and could not take advantage of the victory to advance, but said that the rebels would eventually collapse on their own. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Athens: The rebel fleet has recently concentrated in the port of Kavala in Macedonia, demanding that the Tsaldaris cabinet resign immediately and that rebel leader Venizelos form a government. Otherwise, they will open fire and bombard Athens. According to news from the Bulgarian capital, since last night, fierce fighting has been taking place between the rebel army and the government army 20 miles from the Bulgarian border. However, the Greek embassy in France issued a communiqué stating that "all private news should be treated with extreme reservation. Reports that the city of Larissa has been captured by the rebels and that the city of Salonika has been bombed by aircraft are completely unbelievable. The government army is now concentrated in the province of Macedonia, commanded by Minister of the Army Kondylis. He is now scouting the positions of the rebel army. Kondylis has expressed his desire to minimize bloodshed as much as possible. As for the friendly countries' sympathy for the legitimate Greek government and their hope that Greece will soon end the internal turmoil and consolidate peace in the Balkans, the Greek government is very grateful for this." The rebel warships "Hellas" and "Psara" have arrived at the port of Kavala, joining the rebel fleet there, and have occupied most of the islands in the Aegean Sea along the way. Kavala and Serres are centers of tobacco manufacturing. It is heard that the tobacco factory workers have formed a Soviet organization, with a tendency towards communism. Many senators and deputies of the city of Athens and former cabinet members such as General Tsavellasianos have been arrested, but they have been released after swearing to oppose the rebellion. Prime Minister Tsaldaris's wife has organized a Red Cross field hospital and is about to depart for Macedonia to treat wounded soldiers. Many young women have volunteered to serve as nurses. It is heard that Venizelos will declare independence in Crete and some islands in the Aegean Sea. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>London: General Plastiras, who was once the dictator of Greece for one day, is still residing in Milan. It is rumored that Plastiras has bribed several airlines with heavy money, planning to travel to Crete by plane, but this has been denied. It is heard that the Italian authorities have prohibited Plastiras from traveling to Greece from Italy, even if transportation is convenient. Regarding the news about the overall situation in Greece, there are many contradictions. The unrest has lasted for a week. According to observers, the fact that the rebels have been able to maintain their position for so long proves the strength of their power. The recent news from Athens about the rebels' danger cannot be fully believed. It is heard that the key at the moment is in the Aegean Sea. The warships occupied by the rebels can transport supporting comrades from various islands and ports on the mainland. According to today's communiqué from Salonika, the war in Macedonia cannot proceed due to unfavorable weather conditions. Government aircraft bombed the rebels' barracks and the Serres station today. The communiqué also denies the report that General Garstes, commander of the Komotini Division stationed in the province of Serres, has defected. The activities of the rebels are still unpredictable. It is believed that they have sufficient military pay and ammunition. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e41">Great Powers Willing to Mediate in Greek Civil Strife; Prolonged War May Affect Trade <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(London) It has been suggested that if the Greek government and the rebels voluntarily request the great powers to mediate, the great powers may as well mediate to bring the Greek turmoil to an early end. The British government has expressed its approval of this suggestion. According to political figures, the rebellion of former Greek Prime Minister Venizelos is entirely a matter of Greek internal affairs, and Britain does not want to interfere. However, Britain hopes for peace in the Balkan Peninsula and does not want it to be disturbed by this, so it is willing to do its best. However, Britain's actions should be absolutely limited to reconciliation. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Britain has a very large interest in the Near East, so the events in Greece are of great concern to Britain. People here believe that the government and the rebels are evenly matched, and the period of struggle may be prolonged. If that is the case, trade will inevitably be affected. It is also heard that the rebels may detain foreign ships, all of which make the British people feel uneasy. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers here are deeply concerned that the prolonged Greek civil strife may cause international turmoil in the Balkan Peninsula. The London correspondent of the Paris Echo declares that, as observed by Londoners, the situation in the Balkan Peninsula is extremely serious, and it is feared that the Bulgarian government is supporting the Greek rebels behind the scenes, while Turkey openly supports the Tsaldaris government, because the four countries of Greece, Turkey, Romania, and Yugoslavia signed the Balkan Consultative Pact in February of last year, jointly guaranteeing the territorial status quo of each signatory country. This pact was opposed by former Prime Minister Venizelos, and Bulgaria has always refused to join the pact. Le Petit Journal writes, "Venizelos's anger may have a serious impact on diplomacy and military affairs. The existence and effectiveness of the Balkan Consultative Pact have been proven by the Greek turmoil. The Turkish government has sent troops to Eastern Thrace because Bulgaria has stationed troops on the border, and its intention is to prove that the Balkan Pact and the various treaties previously signed between Turkey and Greece cannot be despised. Therefore, if the Greek turmoil lasts for a long time, or even if the rebels succeed, there is a possibility of extremely serious disturbances in this corner of Europe, which had previously been gradually returning to peace." The newspaper's correspondent in Bulgaria believes that there will be no disputes, saying that "Some clauses of the European war treaty are indeed not willingly adhered to by Bulgaria, but Bulgaria's rearmament in violation of the treaty is, at most, a defensive measure. The Bulgarian authorities have stated that the dispatch of troops to the border is a precautionary measure. In addition, the country's military strength is ultimately limited. Those who cry out loudly can be believed to have no other intentions." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian cruiser "Brescia," the destroyer "Dario Mosto," and the "Pigafetta" have all been ordered to sail to the Italian-owned Dodecanese Islands in the eastern Mediterranean. People here believe that the Greek people are passionately patriotic. In this revolutionary turmoil, the country is divided into two halves, each unwilling to yield. There must be a fierce battle. As for Italy, it should maintain neutrality and never side with either party. When former Greek Prime Minister Venizelos was in power, he recognized Greece as a Mediterranean country and had good feelings towards Italy. Later, Greece joined the Balkan Consultative Pact, which Italy regretted. However, Italy maintains friendly relations with the current Greek government. The Italian government has advised former Greek dictator General Plastiras, who resides in Italy, not to use Italy's tolerant treatment to engage in political activities. Italy's friendly relations with the current Greek government can be proven by this. Moreover, Italy is currently negotiating with Abyssinia and has no time to take care of other matters, so Italy's only hope is for Greece to restore order as soon as possible. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) British and German officials today continued diplomatic talks. British Ambassador to Germany Phipps went to the German Foreign Ministry today and talked with Foreign Minister Neurath for a while. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign Minister Neurath recently declared to British Ambassador to Germany Phipps that Prime Minister Hitler will go to his private residence in Upper Bavaria for a rest of about two weeks in order to recover from his cold as soon as possible. Therefore, he hopes that British Foreign Secretary Simon will come to Germany for an inquiry after Hitler returns to Berlin. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) It is heard that Lord Privy Seal Eden is scheduled to visit Moscow and Warsaw to visit Russian and Polish government officials starting in the last week of March. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Privy Seal Eden recently issued a statement regarding his upcoming trip to Moscow and Warsaw, saying, "I am greatly honored to be able to undertake this task, because the greatest need in Europe at present is to seek the active improvement of mutual relations between countries. I would be very happy if I could contribute to the establishment of international frank understanding. The resolution of the issue of security on the European continent, the maintenance of peaceful and friendly relations, and the maintenance of the authority of the League of Nations for a long time are the only things that we in Britain hope for. However, in order to achieve these goals, it is necessary for the major countries to cooperate." (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Germany previously sent notes to the French and Italian governments, requesting detailed explanations of some of the proposals in the Franco-Italian Rome Accords of January 7. The Italian government has now sent a reply to German Ambassador to Italy Hassel, who will forward it to the German government. Although the contents of the reply are not fully known, it is generally believed that Germany requested explanations on two items. The first item asked how to interpret the so-called "agreement not to interfere in the internal affairs of the other country" in the Rome Accords. The Italian reply said, "According to the Franco-Italian Rome Accords, the signatory countries not only agree to respect other countries, especially Austria's independence and territorial integrity, but also agree not to take any actions that threaten the political and social system of the signatory countries." The second question raised by Germany asked whether other countries could also participate in the Danube River Convention in addition to the countries pointed out in the Rome Accords. The Italian reply said, "In principle, the Danube River Convention should first be signed by the countries that are directly connected by territory, namely Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Later, Poland, France, and Romania may also participate in the convention." Finally, the Italian reply also provided detailed explanations of the League of Nations' role in implementing the Danube River Convention. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>Leningrad: On "March 8" International Women's Day, newspapers pointed out that Soviet women are participating more and more actively in socialist construction. Now, materials on the participation of women in industry in Leningrad are presented, which are of great interest. In 1914, there were 76,413 women participating in industry in Petrograd. By 1934, this number had increased to 220,650, accounting for about 46 percent of all industrial workers in Leningrad. Women account for 13 percent of the local mechanical, technical, and scientific personnel. Before the revolution, one-third of the women in Petrograd were illiterate. Today, there are no illiterate women in Leningrad. (TASS, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Gan Meier Comments on China's Managed Currency System, Believing This System to Be a Stepping Stone to the Gold Standard, But Unsuitable for Chinese National Character <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Princeton - Princeton University Professor Gan Meier, a world authority on currency systems, declared today that China's implementation of a managed currency system may lead to a form of gold standard. Because China has imposed heavy silver export taxes and promulgated other prohibitions on silver exports, it has effectively abolished the silver standard. The silver policies of the United States should be held responsible for this. If the United States abandons its silver policies in the future, the price of silver will inevitably fall, resulting in a large amount of idle silver stored in the U.S. treasury, which will affect the market. The situation will be similar to the re-entry of India's huge silver reserves into the market in recent years, disrupting the world silver market. Gan Meier also stated that the rise in silver prices due to the U.S. silver policy has increased the value of Chinese silver dollars, increasing the debt burden of the Chinese people and severely impacting China's export trade. Furthermore, if China continues to use the silver standard, its finances will be subject to silver purchasers with political influence, and ultimately to the U.S. government's sale of silver, which no country can tolerate. Therefore, the United States has effectively forced China to abandon the silver standard, but it has not considered that a managed currency system is unsuitable for China's needs and national character. China's adoption of this monetary standard is merely a stepping stone to adopting some form of gold standard. Professor Gan Meier's criticism has attracted attention from all sides, as Gan was an economic advisor to China several years ago and suggested that China adopt the gold standard.

<p>(Washington) Experts in Washington, after hearing that China plans to use foreign capital for a managed currency fund, declared today that approximately 100 million U.S. dollars are required to stabilize any new Chinese currency system. They also stated that China should have sufficient funds to offset several years of trade deficits. After China adopts a new currency system based on the British pound or U.S. dollar, trade deficits may cease. Reforming the currency system is indeed beneficial for China, as price levels can be stabilized when calculated in British pounds or U.S. dollars. As for current prices, they fluctuate with the price of silver. However, another view suggests that a managed currency system may require the large-scale issuance of paper money, which is a major difficulty because the Chinese people are not accustomed to using paper money. Moreover, paper money can be manipulated by political forces, which is also an obstacle to gaining the Chinese people's faith in a managed currency system. However, according to the opinion of most experts, although currency reform has many difficulties, it may be beneficial to China. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to the opinion of most bankers in Hong Kong, stabilizing China's currency is indeed a necessary plan, but it requires at least 100 million pounds. Regardless of the fixed exchange rate, currency stability is indeed beneficial for China. (8th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) Sixty-three world economists, bankers, and business leaders, who attended the Carnegie Endowment Committee meeting here yesterday, passed many resolutions, the most important of which was to advocate that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France should immediately begin negotiations to restore the gold standard in order to achieve temporary international financial stability, with the aim of restoring the world gold standard. The committee also suggested that since Britain and the United States are leading creditor nations, they should immediately consult with each other and study with other governments how to enable debtor nations to repay their debts. The meeting lasted three days. Participants included Dr. Butler, President of Columbia University, Clay, Economic Advisor to the Bank of England, Chailan, Vice President of the National Bank of Belgium, and Trolenberg, Vice President of the German Chamber of Commerce, and other famous people.

<p>(London) Although the British government is currently maintaining its original position, refusing to hold negotiations in the near future to stabilize the currencies of various countries, some powerful figures in the financial community all hope to convene an international conference to jointly discuss and devise methods to cope with the consequences arising from the continued decline in currency values. The "Economist" weekly stated that although President Roosevelt cannot openly support international consultation on currency, debt, and tariff policies, now is the appropriate time to convene a second World Economic Conference in order to achieve results. However, before convening the meeting, it is essential that Britain and the United States fully agree on the main points. (8th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>New York - Because France and Belgium advocate using gold to immediately convene a meeting to discuss the exchange market situation, people generally hold hope for currency stability. However, after British Chancellor Chamberlain stated yesterday that Britain is currently unable to stabilize the price of the pound in gold, this hope gradually faded. American observers are convinced that the U.S. authorities will not be swayed by the currency stability movement, but when necessary, President Roosevelt will naturally take the steps he considers best. Therefore, the United States will not refuse any movement that can improve the U.S. domestic economy. However, there is currently no event that can induce the United States to change its current policies, so changes are unlikely to occur in the short term. Today, the pressure on the British pound in the foreign exchange market seems to have temporarily disappeared. Both the U.S. dollar and the French franc are weak. The fluctuation of the British pound is relatively narrow, within two points. The closing price is $4.7875, up one and a half points from yesterday. According to London news, the London foreign exchange market felt mixed again today, but there were fewer transactions. News of unrest in the Balkans caused a buying spree of British pounds and short covering, so the prices of the U.S. dollar and the French franc rose compared to the British pound. Although the London gold price was listed at 148 shillings and 3.5 pence, the price fell by 1 shilling in the afternoon. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e88">Important Pending Issues Between Japan and the Soviet Union <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>(Japan Communication)</p>
<p>The negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union, with their alternating periods of tension and relaxation, constitute a crisis in the Far East. Although this crisis has eased somewhat on the surface since the conference on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, there are still several important pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, such as: (1) the establishment of a Japan-Soviet-"Manchukuo" Border Committee; (2) the North Pacific fisheries dispute; (3) the oil exploitation rights in North Sakhalin; (4) the establishment of a demilitarized zone between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" and Japan's demand for the Soviet Union to withdraw its Far East forces. These are issues that deserve our attention. Of the above issues, the Soviet Union has agreed to the first, and the establishment of the committee will probably materialize soon. In the second issue, part of the problem, such as the exchange rate between the ruble and Japanese gold, has been largely resolved, with only the demarcation of fishing areas remaining problematic, but even that is likely to be resolved. However, the third and fourth issues will probably remain pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, and may even lead to unexpected disputes in the future. Now, please allow me to briefly report on the situation regarding these two issues.</p>
<p>Japan has recently been transforming from a highly developed light industrial country into a heavy industrial country. However, it particularly lacks the material conditions necessary for a heavy industrial country, especially oil. Its domestic production in 1933 accounted for only 7.8% of its total needs. Last year it was even less than that, and there are no areas that can be developed. The only relatively promising and geographically close option is North Sakhalin. However, the business performance of the Japanese there is poor, far less than the output of the Soviet state-owned oil wells. Furthermore, the lease for exploitation will expire next year. Even if the Soviet Union agrees to renew the lease for several years, Japan still does not have the confidence to achieve its expected results. In the future, if war breaks out, it will be even more difficult for Japan to control the oil mines there.</p>
<p>As for the establishment of a demilitarized zone, it is questionable whether the Soviet Union will agree. The Japanese military believes that this is inconsistent with Japan's national defense principles, because it is very difficult for the Japanese troops stationed along the Chinese Eastern Railway to withdraw. Therefore, it proposed another proposal, saying that the Soviet Union should withdraw the troops it has increased in the Far East back to their original defense and restore the border areas in the Far East to the situation before September 18th. In the past, the Soviet Union's Far East defense, from Chita to Vladivostok, had no more than 50,000 troops stationed there. The number of people included in the Pacific Division was not as large as it is now. Today, there are 200,000 Red Army troops stationed along the Amur-Ussuri Railway, with a strong air force attached, with about 600 aircraft, including 80 heavy bombers with a range of about 3,000 kilometers. These aircraft can not only threaten "Manchukuo", but also threaten major Japanese cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagoya. Vladivostok used to be an undefended seaport, but now it houses 40 submarines. Such defenses are definitely not without purpose. Although Japan uses diplomatic language to ask the Soviet Union to withdraw its defenses, will the Soviet Union agree? Moreover, Japan also has two large divisions, a flying regiment, and a tank regiment stationed on the Chinese Eastern Railway line. Which side will easily make concessions first? If concessions are made, where will reliable guarantees come from?</p>
<p>Japan sings the praises of peace, especially to maintain peace in the Far East, but Japan's national defense budget for 1935, including the army and navy, amounted to 1,021.1 million Japanese yen, which is larger than the average annual cost during the Russo-Japanese War. The tense situation in times of emergency is even more prevalent throughout Japan. The Soviet Union's defense expenditure has also increased from 5 billion rubles to 6.5 billion rubles, and the army has increased from 600,000 to 940,000. Neither side is willing to show weakness and both are planning for their own security, and both believe that only full armament can guarantee security.</p>
<p>Then, will the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union become so tense due to facing each other with troops and excessive preparations that a war will break out in the future? Six months ago, it was impossible to guarantee. Now, the only cause of trouble in "Northern Manchuria," the Chinese Eastern Railway, will not lead to war, so at least in the short term, there will be no problems. The Soviet Union has always held the attitude of "We will not attack unless we are attacked." Of course, it will not take offensive measures at present. As for Japan, it has recently realized that invading Siberia will not bring benefits, and it is not sure to use force without reason, so it adopts diplomatic negotiations to achieve the goal of northward advance without using force. However, Japan's current situation is that it must still develop forward, and the continental policy must still be implemented. Therefore, the route it is now pursuing has turned westward and southward. This is what we cannot fail to pay attention to.</p>

<p>—Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Xinjiang's Army and Education</p>
<p>During the era of Yang Zengxin, the Xinjiang army was poorly equipped, and rarely trained in peacetime. The quality was extremely simple. Later, when Jin Shuren managed Xinjiang, he tried to reorganize it, and purchased many new military weapons. After the April 12th coup, Sheng Shicai, the current Border Defense Commissioner, gradually eliminated political opponents such as Ma Zhongying and Zhang Peiyuan, and the provincial administration gradually became unified. He then took the opportunity to reorganize military affairs, reducing the brigades under his command, such as You Desheng, Meng Xu, Liang Qiwen, Song Qingling, and Shen Shiqi, into regiments. In addition to the original regiments, there were more than 20 infantry regiments and 9 cavalry regiments. The regiment was the organizational unit and was directly under the command of the Governor's Office. Other organizations such as artillery, engineers, aircraft, armored vehicles, and the Naturalized Army were also streamlining the old and weak and equipping them with new weapons and taxes. Today, the strength of the Xinjiang army is indeed not what it used to be.</p>
<p>The origin of the Naturalized Army: In the early years of the Republic of China, the Soviet Russian revolutionary cause gradually progressed. The royalist (White Russian) troops of Annenkov and Bachich, each with 8,000 to 9,000 troops and thousands of camels and horses, successively fled into Xinjiang, willing to surrender and naturalize. However, their intentions were unpredictable. Within three years, they caused incidents in Ashan Qitai and other places. They were mostly disarmed and dismissed by the provincial authorities and ordered to be stationed in various counties in northern Xinjiang, and a portion was sent into the customs. These were the so-called naturalized people. In the 20th year, the Hami Incident broke out. The provincial army was in urgent need of defense due to the emergency of the war. Therefore, more than 200 naturalized people were recalled and formed into two artillery special service companies, under the command of Zhang Peiyuan, the commander-in-chief of the front. They were surrounded by the forces of Hejia Niyazi in Liaodong and then released. It was rumored that the Naturalized Army had different intentions. Jin Shuren ordered them to be disarmed and dismissed to farming. In the spring of the 22nd year, Dihua was besieged. Jin Shuren once again gathered a regiment of the Naturalized Army, with Ba Pinggutai as the regimental commander. Later, the Naturalized Army participated in the April 12th coup and made meritorious service, and gradually expanded into a brigade. In the autumn of that year (22nd year), Tao, Li, Chen, and others contacted Ba Pinggutai and failed to overthrow Sheng. Sheng felt that Ba's subordinate Biekdiev had informed him, so he arrested Ba and promoted Bie to brigade commander. There were also Gui army officers Chechenov and Herovsky, who were promoted to brigade commanders in turn. In name, there were three Gui army brigades, but the actual number of people was still insufficient. In the spring of the 23rd year, Ma Zhongying retreated to southern Xinjiang, and the provincial army (including the Gui army) pursued them at every turn. Biekdiev was appointed commander-in-chief of the suppression of bandits in southern Xinjiang, with Wolek, the newly formed leader of the Ashan Gui army, as his deputy. Bie did not live up to the expectations of the people and was transferred to the front-line commander. The vacancy was filled by Liu Bin, the commissioner of the Ili Reclamation Area. Most of the Gui army is now stationed in Kashgar, and its combat effectiveness has always been stronger than that of other provincial armies.</p>
<p>In Xinjiang Province, one reason is that 60 to 70 percent of the population are Chantu, who do not understand the true meaning of education, and often obstruct the promotion of education. Another reason is that the authorities in the past lacked foresight and were perfunctory in running schools, and even implemented the Monroe Doctrine, so that books and newspapers could not be freely imported, resulting in cultural education being always behind. There are currently schools in the provincial capital, including the Russian Legal and Political College, middle school, and primary school. There is one Chantu school and one girls' school in each province and county. There are still many people in primary school, but above middle school, although subsidies are given, there are still few students. One or two primary schools have been set up in the outer counties, and the school name is still National Primary School, but most of them cannot be restored due to the closure of the war. Only the Chantu school run in Dihua has seen a booming trend in enrollment due to the appointment of Chantu people to important positions by the provincial government and the efforts of Cao Qiwen and others, the founders of the school. The leaders of the Chantu in several counties in southern Xinjiang also advocate their willingness to jointly run Chantu-Han combined schools with the government, so that their children can study and learn each other's Chantu and Chinese languages. In Aksu, Kashgar, and other places, the Chantu who serve in the military and political circles also send their children to study in Russia and Turkey. It is expected that the concept of Chantu education will soon change drastically. There is only one library for mass education in the provincial capital, and the books and newspapers on display are mostly old. There are two mass sports organizations, one is the Anti-Imperialist Association and the other is the Women's Association. The association is chaired by Qiu Yufang (Sheng Shicai's wife), the principal of the provincial girls' school, and Gu Lanshu (Zhang Xin's wife, the director of the Education Department), Chen Shumin (Chen Deli's sister, the director of the Finance Department), and Zheng Shuyuan. They advocate equal rights for women, women's education, marriage autonomy, and the liberation of concubines, and their work is very forceful.</p>
<p>Language and writing are the main tools of education. Xinjiang has a complex mix of ethnic groups, and their languages and writings are different. Every time a mass meeting is held in the provincial capital with the participation of all ethnic groups, a leader of one ethnic group must use several ethnic tongues to translate and narrate in turn, which is time-consuming and troublesome. It is conceivable that it is difficult for the effectiveness of education to be on par with that of the interior. It is not entirely due to poor human planning, but also due to objective conditions. However, comparatively speaking, among the languages and writings of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, Chinese and Chantu are the easiest to circulate throughout Xinjiang. Official documents and announcements from government offices use a combination of Chinese and Chantu characters. It goes without saying that Chinese and Chantu people use Chinese and Chantu languages directly in civil and commercial communication. Other ethnic groups such as Mongolians and Kazakhs also mostly use Chinese and Chantu languages to express their meanings. Sometimes the influence of the Chantu language even exceeds that of Chinese. In areas where Chantu people gather in various counties, school education is certainly not developed, but private schools that study and recite the Muslim classics are everywhere. Therefore, if Xinjiang's education in the future still follows the old norms, only knows to implement unified general education, and does not seek variable special education, (such as adapting to the environment and trying to run Chinese-Chantu bilingual schools), it is feared that it will be counterproductive.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Five Provinces' Armies Surround Zhu and Mao's Remnants <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Defenses on Both Sides of the Wujiang River are Consolidated, and Xu's Bandits' Attempt to Flee to Gansu is Repelled.</p>
<p>Hankou Telegram: Zhu and Mao's remnant bandits retreated into Guizhou, intending to secretly cross the Wujiang River and join forces with He and Xiao's remnant bandits in western Hunan. At that time, President Chiang was stationed in Chongqing, and the morale of the bandit suppression armies was doubled. They pursued, suppressed, and intercepted them separately. Although the bandits were brave, it was difficult for them to fly across the Wujiang River. In western Hubei, Xu Yuanquan, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the border area of the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan, had taken office in Feng County, and He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the first route of pursuit and suppression, had also arrived in Changde to supervise the army and continue to encircle and suppress the two bandits, He and Xiao. It is reported that in the area of Meitan and Sinan, the army has been in contact with Zhu and Mao's bandits, and the elite of the bandits have been almost completely lost. Judging from the situation, it will be difficult to break through again. The bandits in southern Shaanxi, after failing to attack Nanbao, defended Ninggui on the one hand, and retreated to northern Sichuan with the rear team. Recently, there has been an attempt to flee to Gansu with all their nests. The Guojun troops were prepared to meet the attack at Dapanyu, Yaojiadu, and other places, killing thousands of bandits. It is expected that they will still be trapped in Nanjiang and make plans for the future. President Chiang, considering the tense military situation of bandit suppression, decided to sit in Chongqing temporarily and personally command all the bandit suppression military affairs in the three provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, in order to unify the steps of the various armies and achieve the full function of eliminating the bandits as soon as possible. Yang Yongtai, the Secretary-General of the Executive Headquarters, Chen Bulei, the first director of the Attendant Room, and He Chengjun, the Chief Pacification Officer stationed in Hubei, were all summoned to Chongqing to participate in the military affairs. Yang left Hankou by car on the 4th, passed Yichang on the 5th, passed Wanxian on the 7th, and will arrive in Chongqing on the 10th. He left by mail plane on the 8th and arrived on the same day. Chen is scheduled to take a boat west on the 9th with his secretary Chen Qiuyang. He told reporters on the verge of leaving that this time he was summoned to Sichuan to participate in the military affairs and would stay for a longer period of time. In the bandit suppression in Sichuan and Guizhou, our army has won consecutive victories and its prestige has been shaken. It is not difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Xinsui Automobile Company, Responsible for the Important Transportation of Xinsui <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>From Suiyuan to Hami, It Can Be Reached in Ten Days.</p>
<p>Beijing Telegram: After the success of automobile transportation between Xinjiang and Suiyuan, the Xinsui Automobile Company is responsible for the transportation of Xinsui. According to Zhu Xiting, the general manager of the company, the organizational situation is as follows:</p>
<p>The Origin of the Founding of Xinsui Automobile</p>
<p>In the past few years, the commercial transportation between Sui and Xin was purely by camel. The two places only traveled back and forth once a year. If the road was slightly unstable, even a single trip back and forth was impossible. In addition, there were many obstacles along the way, which gave various inconveniences to commercial transportation. Once, dozens of merchants and camel households, in order to avoid excessive restrictions along the way, detoured through the Outer Mongolia route, (commonly known as the Great Grassland). As a result, all the camels of more than 2,000 heads and more than 4,000 loads of merchants' goods were detained by Outer Mongolia. After strenuous negotiations, only 200 to 300 camels and 400 to 500 pieces of goods were returned. The total loss was about 3 million yuan, which was the biggest fatal injury to Xinsui commerce. In the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China, I (Zhu said himself) gathered comrades and traveled back and forth on the route several times by camel. After investigation, I decided to improve the transportation of goods in Xinsui and raised funds with Xinsui colleagues to establish Xinsui Long-Distance Automobile, which was the origin of the founding.</p>
<p>The Company's Share Capital is Expanded to One Million</p>
<p>The shareholders of the company are purely Xinsui merchants, hoping to cultivate this road with all their strength, as the lifeline of Xinsui commerce. Unexpectedly, after the establishment of the company, it encountered new changes and stagnated for more than a year. The original plan to use the income from the traffic as working capital also disappeared. However, during the stagnation period, the construction along the line was still not interrupted. In terms of economy, the old shareholders continued to add share capital and assumed the responsibility for working capital. Although the cars have been running recently, the construction along the way still needs to be added, and the amount of gasoline required is also considerable. It was decided to expand the share capital to 1 million yuan. Currently, 600,000 yuan has been fully collected, and the remainder is being raised. It is hoped that the government and those who are interested in the construction of the Northwest will provide assistance. Since the transportation of Xinsui is developed, the development of the future of the Northwest can be predicted.</p>
<p>The Number of Round-Trip Vehicles Will Increase in the Future.</p>
<p>There are currently only more than 50 vehicles traveling back and forth between Xinsui. In terms of the current commercial transportation situation, it is sufficient for application. In the future, new cars will be purchased at any time. According to past statistics, 80 cars were sufficient for the most prosperous year of Xinsui trade. As for the number of round trips, it was originally scheduled to run four times a month. Later, due to the new changes, commerce has not yet recovered, and there are not many merchants' goods, so the monthly trips are only once or twice. In terms of the current situation, the company has no profit. It is hoped that the situation will improve after the number of goods increases and the facilities along the way are completed.</p>
<p>Road Repair Projects are Implemented in Stages</p>
<p>Regarding road repairs, I (Zhu said himself) personally went to investigate. The ones that urgently need to be repaired now are Bailidun near Songshuling, which is about 70 to 80 miles long, and the soft sandy land near Juyanhai, which is about 300 miles long. They must be leveled separately. There are several small rivers between Bailingmiao and Heishatu, and bridges must also be built. The above projects are all large. We are actively trying to proceed. There are still many ups and downs in other places, which should be repaired at any time. It is now planned to handle it in three steps. The first step of the project will take about one year to complete. The road repair machines have been fixed in Shanghai and will be shipped next month, and will be implemented according to the plan. The road repair workers are required to be recruited in sections. The labor near Erlizihe in Juyanhai will be recruited from Jinta and Tiancang. The section from Suiyuan to Erlizihe will be recruited from Suiyuan. Those near Hami will be recruited in Hami. The branch line in Suzhou will be recruited in Suzhou. The food needed by the workers is transported by camel and stored in each station for backup.</p>
<p>Shorten Time and Develop Business</p>
<p>The route from Suiyuan to Hami is more than 5,000 miles long. At first, it took 20 days. Later, it was reduced to 16 days. After repeated reductions, it has recently been reduced to 10 days and even 8 and a half days. Although the standard for delay has not been determined, if the weather is good, the speed of the car will be more accurate. In the future, after the road repair plan is completed, it is expected to be reduced to one round trip every five days, which is incomparable to the past. The central government and the Sui and Xin authorities have previously promised to provide the company with material assistance. If it can be realized, the development will be faster. In addition to the postal agreement that the company has signed with the post office, it is currently negotiating a parcel agreement, which will be established soon. In this way, the company's business will have a reliable guarantee. As for the passenger fare, there was previously a preferential method for students, aimed at encouraging students in the Northwest to study in the interior. Recently, the company is very willing to treat the families of the righteous army going to Xinjiang with preferential treatment, but because of the large number of people, if it is handled in accordance with the preferential treatment method for students, the company will not be able to afford it. Assuming that it can afford the gasoline needed, the company can waive all other expenses. The difficulties in the middle are understandable to the people of the country. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Copper and Xiao Counties Jointly Dredge the Kui River <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>—Disputes Arising from Opposition by People of Su County Subside Quickly</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Water conservancy in the Xuzhou region is underdeveloped, and river courses have long been neglected. As a result, farmland suffers whenever there is heavy rain. This spring, Copper and Xiao counties jointly dredged the Kui River, but the people of Su County in northern Anhui Province rose up in opposition, leading to disputes, which quickly subsided. The situation is described below:</p>
<p>Kui River Water Conservancy</p>
<p>The Kui River originates in the Shi Gou Lake southwest of Yuxu City, flows northeast through the Su Dike, passes between the east and west walls of the south gate of the city, then turns south, passing through Kui You, Sanguanmiao, Shilibu, Gaoying, Xusancun, Shilong Bridge, Huangqiao, Yiqiao, and Yangzhuang before entering Xiao County from Tong County. It then passes through Jiaqiao, Anlou, and Fenghuang Mountain in Xiao County before entering Su County, passing through Shixiangji and reaching Shicun, where it empties into the Sui River. The entire river is over seventy li long, with forty kilometers in Tong County, six kilometers in Xiao County, and thirty kilometers in Su County. Regarding its water conservancy relations, the water in the Shi Gou Lake at the source has dried up, while the water in the Jinzhong Lake south of Xing Mountain west of the lake overflows, pouring into the Kui River and increasing its source. South of Huangqiao, the Guanggou River also flows into the Kui River, and at Yiqiao, the Langxi River flows into the Kui River. There are no fewer than seven or eight other canals and ditches along the river that flow into the Kui River. Therefore, specifically in Tong County, the Kui River is related to the water conservancy of the east, west, and south sides of the county. In Xiao County, the water from Gushan Lake flows into the Kui River, and in Su County, it enters the Sui River, further increasing the water conservancy of the Sui River. The Sui River splits into three streams when it reaches Su County. The one north of the city is called the North Stream River, the one south of the city is called the Middle Stream River, and the one further south is called the South Stream River. The Kui River enters the North Stream River four li west of Shicun, which helps the Sui River for navigation and irrigation.</p>
<p>Reasons for Joint Dredging</p>
<p>The joint dredging by Copper and Xiao counties dates back to the joint dredging by Xiao and Su counties in the eighth year of the Republic [1919]. At that time, Xiao and Su counties were in contact, and the people of Su County believed that the Kui River flowed through the Phoenix Egg, where two mountains constricted the water. They feared that after dredging the upstream, the water flow would be too strong. They proposed diverting the river around the west side of the Phoenix Egg, with Xiao County helping. This was done once. However, after the people of Xiao County helped with the work, the people of Su County still interfered with Xiao County's dredging of the river. This time, the joint dredging by Copper and Xiao counties is a continuation of the previous agreement. The planned method is that Xiao County would start work on the third of this month and complete it in two weeks, while Copper County would start work on the eighth and complete it in one month. Xiao County would also inform Su County to start dredging at this time to improve water conservancy in the Xuzhou region and northern Anhui Province. This would thoroughly implement the previous agreement, and the Jinzhong, Guanggou, Langxi, and other rivers related to the Kui River in Copper County could all flow smoothly, and the Gushan and other water flows related to the Kui River in Xiao County would also benefit. The work began as scheduled after a report was submitted to the Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>Course of the Conflict</p>
<p>After the people of Xiao County started work, the people of Su County gathered hundreds of armed militia and security teams at Shixiangji on the fourth. That evening, they crossed the border into Xiao County. Seeing that the people of Xiao County were dredging the river and concentrated at Anlou, they attacked Anlou. The people of Xiao County had expected this action by the people of Su County and were prepared, so they resisted. The two sides fought fiercely for a day and a night. On the evening of the fifth, the people of Su County, being isolated across the border and unable to withstand the military force, retreated to Su County. Both sides suffered injuries, but fortunately there were no deaths. After the people of Su County retreated, they remained gathered at Shixiang Town, while the people of Xiao County concentrated their defenses at Phoenix Mountain. Qu Zhuxun, the magistrate of Su County, rushed to Shixiangji and telegraphed Wang Gongyu, the magistrate of Tongshan County, asking him to relay to Yao Xuehuai, the magistrate of Xiao County, to meet at Phoenix Egg. After Wang relayed the message to Yao, both declined, saying that they had not received orders and could not leave the border. Yao then rushed to Anlou to supervise the work, while Wang also went to Yangzhuang on the morning of the seventh to prepare for work. Because the planned project between Copper and Xiao counties could not be stopped, it still needed to be continued.</p>
<p>Commissioner's Inspection</p>
<p>Shao Hanyuan, the commissioner of the Copper District, received a report of the conflict between the people of Xiao and Su counties, so he took the Jinpu train south on the morning of the seventh and got off at Caocun. At that time, Xiao County had sent a cavalry team to greet him. Shao rode to Jiaqiao and walked along the west bank of the Kui River to Anlou. Along the way, he saw that the people of Xiao County who were working, in addition to the able-bodied men, women and children were also participating. The people of Xuzhou's hardships were evident here. After arriving at Anlou, in addition to Magistrate Yao greeting him, Magistrate Wang also came to pay his respects. Shao carefully inspected the river work. The newly dredged river surface was about twenty meters wide, and the overturned soil was used to build the dikes, making the project very solid. Wang Niandong, the head of the Construction Department of Xiao County, was also supervising the work at Anlou. According to him, 30,000 laborers were currently employed, and it was originally planned to complete the dredging in two weeks, but now that the dredging had been accelerated, it could be completed in ten days. These 30,000 laborers were working hard under the protection of Phoenix Mountain, without any negligence, so that this project could be completed and other water flows could be dredged to solve the water conservancy problems of the entire territory. When Magistrate Wang came from Yangzhuang, he led many people from the townships to visit and learn from it, and after returning, he would start work the next day (the eighth). Yao reported to Shao the situation of the conflict at that time. Shao instructed that since the conflict was over, no more quarrels should be started. He should complete the Kui dredging project while taking a peaceful negotiation attitude under legitimate defense. After inspecting the sections, Shao returned to Caocun and took the Jinpu evening train back to Xuzhou. After the people of Su County returned to Shixiangji, most of them had dispersed, but 200 members of the security team were stationed there, and the turmoil could be expected to subside. Qu Zhuxun, the magistrate of Su County, came to Xuzhou from Su County on the evening of the seventh. After inquiring and learning that Commissioner Wang and Magistrate Yao had both gone to Anlou and could not meet, he returned to Su County. It is estimated that this matter can be resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>Project Plan</p>
<p>The Kui River flows the most through Copper County. The Construction Department of the County Government measured and marked the route, with one marker every 300 meters. The width of the new river bottom was 4 meters at marker zero, and increased by 6.9 centimeters per marker thereafter. At marker 23, the Chenghai River flowed in, adding 2 meters in width. At marker 97, the Guanggou River flowed in, adding 3 meters in width. At marker 112, the Langxi River flowed in, adding 2 meters in width. At marker 131, the end point of Copper County, the bottom width was 20 meters. The slope of the river bottom was divided into three sections: 1 in 2500 from marker zero to marker 17 (Su Dike), 1 in 5000 from marker 17 to marker 35 (Kui Mountain), and 1 in 8000 from marker 35 to marker 131 (Jiaqiao). The slope was 1:1 except for the areas near the city, where it was 1:1.5. The total earthwork was 960,000 cubic meters, and it was estimated that 10,000 laborers could complete it in one month. The river work in Xiao County was similar to the end point of Copper County, and the project could be completed in ten days. As of today (the eighth), it is already halfway completed.

<h3 id="e94">Jiaoji Railway Bureau Holds Discussion Meeting on Improving Commercial Transport <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Over one hundred representatives from various places attended, with over one hundred proposals presented. Qingdao Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway convened a discussion meeting on improving commercial transport. Preparations had been made for many days in advance, and chambers of commerce along the line were notified to send representatives to Qingdao to participate. The Railway Bureau received over one hundred proposals from various places, and the representatives from various places have now arrived. At 10:00 am on the sixth, after the representatives signed in, the opening ceremony was held in the bureau's auditorium. Attendees included Zhang Honglie, the Director of the Shandong Construction Department; Shen Honglie, the Mayor of Qingdao; Chu Zhen, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau (representing Dong Zhidao); Ge Guangting, the Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee; Lu Mengxiong, Cui Shijie, Peng Dongyuan, Chen Yanwen, Tan Shukuai, the Director of the Military Affairs Department, and others. After the meeting began as scheduled, Chairman Ge Guangting delivered the opening speech, saying, "Today, the Jiaoji Railway's discussion meeting on improving commercial transport is being held. We are honored to have representatives from various places participating from afar, and to have Director Zhang of the Provincial Government, Mayor Shen of this city, and distinguished guests attending. Railway transport and commercial trade are as interdependent as the spokes of a wheel. The prosperity or decline of transport and the rise or fall of commerce are mutually dependent and closely related. Therefore, if we want to develop the railway and prosper commerce, we must have cooperation and assistance between the railway and businesses to be effective. I have been in charge of this railway for four years, and all the measures taken have been in line with the principle of mutual assistance between the railway and businesses. I have done my best to accommodate and strive for this goal. For example, I have repeatedly submitted proposals to the Ministry of Railways for approval to reduce freight rates for coal and major agricultural products, which are clear examples. Therefore, in recent years, even in the midst of the national economic depression, businesses along the line have generally benefited from considerable convenience, and the railway's transport has also increased slightly. This is the result of the sincere mutual assistance between the railway and businesses, which I am proud to report. However, in recent years, due to the impact of various environments, the changes in the commercial sector have been rapid. The rise and fall of commerce in various places, the increase and decrease in the production of goods, the urgency of needs, and the ebb and flow of sales have all undergone changes. Therefore, how can we ensure that the railway and businesses can meet each other's supply and demand and work together seamlessly? Only by the railway and businesses re-discussing and coordinating plans can we adapt to the times and jointly devise improvements. The railway, in view of this, has organized this improvement discussion meeting. We hope that the representatives will uphold the spirit of mutual assistance from the past, be open and honest, and conduct detailed discussions to arrive at a common conclusion. Within the possible scope, the railway will do its best to implement them to meet your expectations. Furthermore, since the 21st year of the Republic [1932], the production and sales of coal and major agricultural products in Shandong Province have been affected by various factors and have not been prosperous. Fortunately, Director Zhang of the Shandong Provincial Government and Mayor Shen of this city, as well as the Port Authority, the Social Affairs Bureau, the China Merchants Bureau, and various legal entities, have provided many protections and unanimously appealed, and last year there was a great improvement. To seek the welfare of commerce, I sincerely hope that Mayor Shen, Director Zhang, and all parties will express their views and guide the railway and businesses to cooperate so that we can follow their guidance. This is what I earnestly hope for." Next, the Director of the Traffic Department gave a report, saying, "The meaning of convening this discussion meeting on improving commercial transport has already been reported by the Chairman. Now, I will briefly report to you on the recent measures and improvements in traffic management. The main freight of this railway is coal, coke, peanuts, tobacco, and cotton, followed by wood, flour, wheat, cotton yarn, soybeans, and raw beef. Last year, the total transport volume was about 4.33 million tons, an increase of one time compared to the total transport volume of 2.44 million tons in the 18th year of the Republic [1929]. The reason why we were able to achieve this result is entirely due to the cooperation between the railway and businesses. The improvements in passenger and freight transport in the past and the distribution of vehicles are described below. (1) Passenger Transport: The improvements in passenger transport can be divided into twenty items: 1. Adding second-class sleeping cars; 2. Renovating first-class sleeping cars; 3. Renovating the seats in third-class passenger cars to make passengers more comfortable; 4. Adding arrival announcement systems to passenger trains; 5. Posting safety posters in stations; 6. Paying attention to cleanliness inside the cars; 7. Improving the dining car service to make it more affordable and building a railway hotel at Weixian Station; 8. Adding waiting rooms at each station; 9. Increasing or extending the platforms at each station; 10. Building rain shelters at major stations; 11. Extending ticket sales hours; 12. Adding passenger information desks; 13. Adding refrigerated cars; 14. Expanding passenger intermodal stations; 15. Organizing water-land intermodal transport; 16. Planning automobile intermodal transport; 17. Planning to open a Qingping direct train; 18. Extending the summer tour ticket time; 19. Adding second-class sleeping cars for group tours to Qingdao from Pingjin and other places; 20. Shortening daytime driving time. (2) Freight Transport: The improvements in freight transport can also be divided into twenty items: 1. Expanding the scope of responsible transport; 2. Organizing domestic intermodal transport; 3. Organizing water-land intermodal transport; 4. Implementing through transport between Luo and Huang; 5. Implementing railway collection of freight charges; 6. Issuing railway freight pickup cards; 7. Providing low-cost freight insurance; 8. Reducing freight rates for bulk goods; 9. Organizing economic surveys along the line; 10. Formulating special prices for intermodal goods; 11. Cooperating with academic institutions to improve agricultural products; 12. Adding or extending freight platforms at each station; 13. Adding freight houses and food storage at each station; 14. Adding sidings at each station; 15. Adding ninety-ton shunting engines; 16. Building shunting yards at Dagang and Zhangdian stations; 17. Increasing locomotives and rolling stock; 18. Increasing freight car accessories; 19. Shortening the time for freight handling; 20. Extending the summer freight car detention time. As for the railway's distribution of vehicles, it has always been based on the principle of fairness and impartiality for various commercial goods on trunk and branch lines. The railway's freight sources usually come from coal and coke from stations on the branch lines, local products from Jinan, and imported groceries from Qingdao. In terms of transport, more goods come from the east than from the west, with the west accounting for only half of the east. In the past, due to frequent military operations, many of the railway's freight cars were requisitioned. As of the end of the 18th year of the Republic [1929], more than 300 cars (more than 6,000 tons) had not been returned, accounting for one-sixth of the railway's original freight cars. Later, the railway successively purchased 150 coal cars and 50 covered cars of 40 tons each, totaling 8,000 tons, which restored the old appearance of the loss of transit vehicles. It is estimated that the total number of vehicles on the railway is more than 41,000 tons. Excluding the transit vehicles that have not been returned and those that are routinely repaired in the factory, the total number of vehicles that can be used is more than 35,200 tons. If calculated at an average turnover of once every three days, the daily practical loading capacity is about 10,000 tons. Therefore, it is difficult to cope with the busy freight transport in winter. Regarding the distribution of trains on the branch lines, the station is the unit first, and then the coal merchant is the unit for distribution. The method of allocating vehicles to each station is to allocate them according to a certain ratio. This ratio is determined based on the annual coal transportation volume of each station. Boshan accounts for 51%, Hongshan accounts for 27%, and Dakunlun accounts for 22%. The total number of coal trucks allocated to branch lines in the past three years has increased year by year. It is estimated that the number of vehicles allocated in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933] increased by about one-fifth compared with the 21st year of the Republic [1932], and the number of vehicles allocated in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] increased by more than one-fifth compared with the 22nd year of the Republic [1933]. This is due to the gradual increase in coal and coke transportation and sales, and the acceleration of vehicle turnover can also be seen. The tonnage loaded on the trunk line is usually more than 4,000 tons per day, and can reach 5,000 to 6,000 tons during peak periods. Combined with the tonnage of freight transported on the branch lines, the daily average is about 10,000 tons. Based on the above, the railway's daily practical loading capacity can only cope with the continuous transport, and it is difficult to have a sudden increase. If the transportation of bulk goods is booming and it is desired to fully transport a certain kind of goods, it is not possible. In addition, the demand for vehicles from merchants at various stations often increases or decreases with the rise and fall of market prices, that is, they are eager to clear the goods when the market price rises, and they hoard and wait and see when the market price falls, failing to continue average consignment, resulting in the supply and demand often failing to correspond, which is what the railway feels most difficult about and hopes to improve together. In total, the freight transport performance in the past six years has increased year by year, except for the 19th year of the Republic [1930] when the route was interrupted due to the war, resulting in a reduction in color due to the suspension of transportation for two months, and the most significant increase was in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], which was 49% more than in the 18th year of the Republic [1929]. This is proof that the performance of dispatching has increased year by year." Then Mayor Shen, Director Zhang, and Commissioner Lu gave speeches, and finally the Chairman gave a reply. It was already past 12 o'clock, and the meeting adjourned after taking pictures. The meeting is scheduled for two days, so the meeting will continue on the afternoon of the sixth and tomorrow (the seventh) to discuss the proposals of various industries. (the sixth)</p>

<h3 id="e104">Minister Kong Convened Leaders from All Sectors Yesterday to Discuss Measures to Aid the Market <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations Lasted Three Hours with Good Results; Another Meeting Will Be Convened Within Days</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, various groups in Shanghai jointly petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to provide relief to the market. Yesterday morning at approximately 9:00 AM, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi invited leaders from various sectors to a meeting at the Ministry of Finance office on Rue Mère Amable to discuss relief measures. The meeting lasted three hours and yielded satisfactory results. After individual sectors deliberate separately, another meeting will be convened to discuss implementation methods. Details are as follows:</p>

<p>Objectives of Discussion: The meeting focused on discussing how to alleviate the decline of various current businesses. It was emphasized that each sector should strive to find ways to help itself, while the government should also do its utmost to support the effort. The primary objective was to avoid alarming each other and creating unnecessary panic, and to maintain calm and unity to cope with the situation. It was believed that the current economic situation was not particularly difficult, and that as long as the objectives were clear, people were reassured, and development was jointly planned, the difficulties could be easily resolved.</p>

However, regarding concrete methods, it was decided that leaders of each sector would be responsible for convening individual meetings to discuss the details. Minister Kong would then convene another meeting to decide on implementation methods. Matters involving other areas were not discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p>Optimistic Outlook: The meeting concluded at 12:30 PM. The representatives felt that the results were satisfactory and were optimistic about the prospects for relief. It was reported that local associations, banking circles, and industrial and commercial sectors were scheduled to convene meetings within the next two days, led by responsible individuals, in order to ensure concerted effort and avoid mutual disruption and stagnation. It was heard that due to the suddenness of the matter, meetings had not been held last night.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Military Section of the Military Transportation Inspection Group, Including Xu Tingyao, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Group of Fourteen Arrived in the Afternoon; Will Stay for Two or Three Days Before Reporting to the Capital</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Xu Tingyao, the head of the military section of the Military Transportation Inspection Group, led a group of fourteen members on the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso, arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM after travelling from Europe. They will report to the capital within two or three days. The date of their trip to Sichuan to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will be determined after seeking instructions. Xu and his team spent nine months in Europe conducting a thorough examination of the military equipment of various countries. Details of their arrival in Shanghai are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival Situation: The transportation section of the group, including Yu Feipeng, had arrived in Shanghai on the first of the month, having travelled from America. The military section, since it did not inspect the United States, returned directly from Europe on the Conte Rosso. The ship entered the Wusongkou port at 2:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong at 3:30 PM. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau each sent special boats to welcome the group. Those present included Secretary Tang Shixuan, representing Mayor Wu; Chief of Staff Xu Jinyuan of the Songhu Garrison Command; Wang Zhinan and Wen Hongyin, secretaries of the Municipal Security Office; Cai Jinjun, head of the Municipal Police Bureau; Yu Feipeng, head of the transportation section of the Military Transportation Inspection Group; members Wu Baofeng, Wei Yifu, and Jiang Chuou; Zou Lun, representing Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; and dozens of relatives and friends of the group members.</p>
<p>Names of Group Members: The military section of the group consisted of sixteen members. Except for Ji Yongzhong (attached to the Transportation Corps), who remained in Germany to study military communications, and Jiang Chuou, who returned home earlier due to the death of his father, fourteen members returned home yesterday. They were: Xu Tingyao (head), Wang Jinglu, Hua Zhenlin, Si Li, Zheng Fangheng, Tian Gengyuan, Chu Song, Jin Keshao, Ren Runtian, Jia Xuan, Zhang Wen, Xi Wangqing, Zhang Shigang, and Peng Zifang. After landing at the New Customs Wharf, they dispersed to various hotels to rest. Xu, who is about forty years old, wore a black suit yesterday and had a gentle demeanor and the air of a scholar.</p>
<p>Xu's Remarks: According to Xu, who spoke to reporters from various newspapers on board, he and his team were assigned to visit European countries to inspect military equipment, including army organization, military institutions, military industry, military education, etc. They left the country on May 11 of last year. After arriving in Europe, they visited all European countries. Due to time constraints, they did not go to the Americas. Based on their observations, the military equipment of various countries cannot be clearly seen on the surface, so they focused on the development of heavy industry in various countries, as heavy industry is the foundation of military equipment. In any country, if its domestic heavy industry is developed, its military equipment will be impressive. A portion of the inspection report has already been sent back. The reports on Italy and small countries near Italy were sent to Beijing in August of last year. Reports on Germany, Russia, and Czechoslovakia were sent to Beijing in December of last year. Reports on the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, and other countries have been compiled and will be submitted to Beijing in the next two or three days. In addition to this report, a general report will be compiled and refined for reference. The date of the trip to Sichuan to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will be determined after seeking instructions. Xu continued to talk about the international situation, saying that after touring all of Europe, he felt that no country had the determination to go to war. Since the World War, people have been tired of war and chaos. However, the development of various industries in various countries can be used for war at any time, so countries are actively expanding their defense equipment. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, due to its colonial relations, it is actively expanding its military equipment, but its air force equipment is not as good as other countries. The United Kingdom has a population of 45 million, and London accounts for one-fifth of it. Various industries are also concentrated in London, so the British capital is the center of the country's essence. However, its air force equipment is not very thorough. Once an incident occurs, if the enemy air force attacks, it will inevitably suffer great losses. Therefore, the United Kingdom is now actively expanding its air force equipment.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Silk and Satin Trade Association Passes Commercial Acceptance Bill Procedures <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Letter requesting Shanghai Silk Industry Bank to promote discounting, sent by the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association, in order to improve the credit system and increase currency utilization, created commercial acceptance bills in accordance with the Bills of Exchange Law. After submitting the proposal to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Ninth Executive Supervisory Committee and receiving approval, it sent letters to various businesses, encouraging them to adopt the practice uniformly, and requested that banks and money shops discount the bills as much as possible, and that the Central Bank rediscount them according to law. This was previously reported in this newspaper. It is now understood that this acceptance bill has been studied by the association's chairman for a long time and is considered to be in line with legal principles and actual circumstances. It was unanimously approved at a provisional members' meeting on February 21st of this year and handed over to the association's Executive Supervisory Committee for active implementation. Preparations are now nearing completion. Yesterday, the association held a special standing committee meeting, where Chairman Luo Qinghua reported on the progress of the case and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's reply. The meeting resolved to approve the procedures for using commercial acceptance bills and sent a letter to the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank requesting its promotion and acceptance of discounting to facilitate circulation. Subsequently, Gao Shiheng, a representative of the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association, expressed his strong desire to proceed in unison. The usage procedures and correspondence are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptance Bill Usage Procedures: When customers inquire about payment methods for goods they have selected from this store, aside from cash transactions, there are four types of credit periods: (1) ten days, (2) twenty days, (3) thirty days, and (4) forty days. However, the maximum period should not exceed forty days. The price of the goods should be determined based on the length of the credit period. After the customer specifies the payment date, the price should be negotiated and calculated accurately. Then, the amount of money to be paid and the deadline should be clearly stated on the bill. The credit period is the number of days from the date of sight of the bill until it is due. The customer pays the amount of money listed above. This bill is issued by the seller, who first affixes an official seal. When the goods are delivered to the customer's home, the bill is presented to the customer for acceptance. Upon receiving the bill, the customer should verify the amount and due date. If there are no errors, the customer should affix an official and valid seal under the "Acceptor" section of the bill and return it to the original presenter. The "Presentation Date" on the bill is the date the customer received the bill and affixed their seal of acceptance. The right-hand section of the bill should be cut off by the customer for their records. After the seller receives the accepted bill with the customer's seal, they can sign or stamp the back of the bill and discount it at a bank or money shop to obtain funds for turnover. After receiving the bill, the bank or money shop should first present it to the acceptor for verification. When the bill is due, the acceptor should be asked to affix their original seal again on the blank space on the front of the bill to show their solemnity. On the due date, the holder of the bill (the seller or the bank/money shop) presents the bill to the payment location. The acceptor should immediately pay the full amount. After payment, the acceptor takes back the bill. The holder of the bill does not issue a separate receipt or stamp a return receipt. At this point, the procedures for both parties are complete, and the sales relationship is concluded. After the implementation of this commercial acceptance bill, there are two points that should be clarified. Please ask customers to understand: (1) The amount stated on the bill is the net amount of the transaction and should not be discounted at the time of payment. (2) Payment must be made in cash or immediate bank drafts on the due date to maintain credit. This acceptance bill is issued by the Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association, submitted to the Ninth Executive Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for resolution and has been reported to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for approval and record. All members of the trade, whether members or non-members, must purchase from this association at a set price and use it uniformly. Face Format of the Acceptance Bill.</p>
<p>Acceptance Bill Format: The front and back format of the acceptance bill are shown below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Reply: We acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 4th, stating that your association is planning to handle commercial acceptance bills to facilitate turnover. You requested that we send letters to various industries to adopt them uniformly, and that we send letters to banks and money shops to discount the aforementioned bills as much as possible, and that we send a special letter to the Central Bank to handle rediscounting. We have investigated the handling of commercial acceptance bills to facilitate turnover, and the Enameled Porcelain industry has once discussed handling it. At a time when funds are insufficient for turnover, it is urgent to promote and imitate. We have already sent letters to various industries, asking them to promote and try it out on their own. As for the extent to which banks and money shops discount and the Central Bank handles rediscounting, this association has this plan in the five rescue measures for the market, and now we have sent a special letter to the Central Bank and banks and money shops to ask them to do so.</p>
<p>Letter to Shanghai Silk Industry Bank: Dear Sirs, We believe that in our country's economic system, in addition to cash, most transactions rely on credit, which delays capital and hinders trade. Now, at a time of industrial and commercial decline and financial exhaustion, we should find ways to improve the credit system as a means of relief. Our industry has always relied on banks and money shops to lend funds to customers for turnover, which has been a long-standing practice. Now that the market is depressed, banks and money shops are tightening lending, resources are exhausted, and economic operations are more difficult than in other industries. If we use cash transactions, we are afraid that it will be difficult to promote in the customer sector because the habit has been entrenched. If we still grant credit, there is no way to attract investment, and we will become more impoverished. In order to plan for the benefit of both buyers and sellers, we have resolved at a temporary members' meeting of our branch to create commercial acceptance bills in accordance with the Bills of Exchange Law, with the aim of reducing the credit period and increasing the use of currency, and we have also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform all industries to implement it uniformly. According to the benefits of using commercial acceptance bills, the seller has a definite date for collecting the goods sold in a short time, and can also specially discount them with banks and money shops, so that the currency is increased invisibly, the turnover is flexible, and the business can gradually develop. For the buyer, the payment is fixed on a date so that there is no lack of preparation, and for banks and money shops, this acceptance bill has the joint responsibility of both the issuer and the acceptor, and the term is not too long. If discounting is accepted, it is safer and more reliable than ordinary credit lending. It not only obtains a safe way to invest and profit, but also supports the development of industry and commerce. There is nothing better than to do several good things at once. Moreover, commercial bills have been around for a long time in European and Western countries, and therefore, with the popularity of these bills, the discounting business has also followed suit, and even the establishment of a discounting market has been used as a central hub for operation. Our country is relatively late in adopting the trend, and there will inevitably be difficulties at first in the creation of the aforementioned commercial bills. We know that your bank is a rising star in the banking sector and spares no effort in adjusting finance and serving society, and our silk and satin industry has benefited even more because of its business relationship. Therefore, it has made rapid progress in business and reputation in less than a few years, and it has taken the lead in the trend, created new plans, and planned carefully. Industries and commerce have benefited a lot. Now the commercial acceptance bill created by our industry is the same as your bank's usual purpose, and we hope to invite you to sponsor it. We hope that when our industry implements it on a regular basis, we will allow commercial discounts to circulate, so that both industry and commerce can benefit, not just our industry alone. We sincerely hope for your understanding and a reply.</p>

<p>Hope to forward the consultation to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau for implementation</p>
<p>Shiye She reports that the Municipal Pawnshop Trade Association reported that the stamp inspection has been assigned by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to a commissioner responsible for the entire inspection of the territory. Recently, the Tobacco and Alcohol Unified Tax Bureau dispatched investigators to repeat the inspection, which is extremely harsh. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to Cai Jinjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting that he forward the consultation to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to stop sending repeated inspections in order to unify authority and save harshness. The original letter said: We respectfully report that our association has recently received reports from the member pawnshops in the Nanshi district, roughly stating that in addition to the commissioner sent by the Public Security Bureau, the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau also has investigators who come to the pawnshop to conduct the same inspection. When inspecting, they turn over boxes and cabinets and check every detail, which causes great anxiety to merchants. In addition, the Public Security Bureau's commissioner has just finished the inspection, and then the Tax Bureau's investigators come again. Shop assistants are too busy to welcome and send them off, and the business is affected. We hope that the主管官署 (zhuguan guanshu) will be applied to seek correction in order to relieve merchants' difficulties. According to this, we think that the Tax Bureau's levy is originally an inherent power, which cannot be criticized. However, when the authority is not unified, it is easy to cause misunderstandings. Abusing the search will inevitably involve disturbance. In the past, when the Tax Bureau conducted inspections, it was only with the Chamber of Commerce to show solemnity, and the Public Security Bureau only sent police officers to assist. Now, your bureau has established a commissioner to inspect stamps, and the entire inspection responsibility has been assigned. The Tax Bureau does not need to send another investigator. The unified and repeated inspection will inevitably be regarded as true by each party. The situation of the harshness and disturbance of the people is as our members have said. Moreover, which merchant is not willing to affix stamps to all the documents related to the business to prove its validity? Even if there are omissions, it is unintentional. Since there are commissioners who take turns inspecting, the fact is enough to be vigilant. Therefore, our association believes that the Tax Bureau's investigators can be abolished to save public funds and eliminate disturbances. If it is said that the investigators' salaries are meager and rely on the deduction of fines, then the purpose of the inspectors is here and not there, and it is easier to be harsh when performing their duties. At a time when the market is depressed and business is exhausted, if the fault of temporary negligence is suffered from the pain of being summoned for questioning and fined, it is enough to please those who can mention it, and the pain of the merchant's groaning is truly unbearable. This is not the original intention of the national levy. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan has amended the Stamp Tax Ordinance to reduce the punishment as much as possible, which has truly won the hearts of the people. We have long admired your voice and have been concerned about the people's suffering for a long time. The new ideas you have established are admired by all the people. We also ask you to adopt our humble opinion and transfer the document to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to stop sending repeated inspections in order to unify authority and save harshness. For stamp cases that are detected, those who have omissions or insufficient stamps are unintentional, and we hope to handle them leniently in order to relieve merchants' difficulties. Then, the pawnshop industry will not only feel your kindness. This is above Shanghai Public Security Bureau Director Cai, Shanghai Pawnshop Trade Association.</p>
<h3 id="e116">All Circles in This City Initiate the Construction of Statues of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Memorial Pavilion of Mayor Wu <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Confucius Youth Association,中華全國道路建設協會 (Zhonghua Quanguo Daolu Jianshe Xiehui) ,中華國貨維持會 (Zhonghua Guohuo Weichi Hui) ,中華航業互助會 (Zhonghua Hangye Huzhu Hui) , Shanghai Citizens Promoting National Goods Association, Zhongshan Shanghai Fellow Association, Shandong Guild Hall, Shanghai Yarn Industry Trade Association, Bean and Rice Trade Association, Copper and Tin Trade Association, Wood Trade Association, Fresh Pig Industry Trade Association, Clock and Watch Industry Trade Association, Egg Industry Trade Association, Frozen Fish Industry Trade Association, and dozens of other groups, with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Mayor Wu making special contributions to the country and local areas, jointly initiated the construction of bronze statues and memorial pavilions in this city to show respect and to encourage future generations. After hearing the news, all circles expressed their sympathy and joined the initiators enthusiastically. Individuals include Wu Yunzhai, General Manager of Shanghai Jin Cheng Bank, Huang Zaoxiong, Standing Director of the Shanghai Education Association, Ye Kaixin, former Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, Wang Tang, former Director of the Guangdong Department of Finance and current Philippine Consul General, He Dequi, Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau, Chen Yafu, Principal of Lehua Girls' Middle School, and Tang Jisan, General Manager of Shanghai Huacha Co., Ltd. For the convenience of the proceedings, the initiating groups have temporarily used 173 Gongjiazhai Road, Zhabei, as the preparatory office, and are now actively soliciting initiators, welcoming all groups and individuals to participate in order to collect the strength of the masses. The methods of soliciting initiators are divided into three types, including Type A, bearing 40 yuan, Type B, 20 yuan, and Type C, 10 yuan. Groups and individuals are subject to the same rules. A simple charter is available and is being sent to all circles. It is now heard that Mayor Wu stated that although the initiative of all circles to cast statues came from public opinion, he himself expressed that there was no need to cast statues and declined repeatedly, and has written to the initiating groups to stop the proceedings. However, he expressed extreme approval for the construction of a statue of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It is also heard that all circles believe that Mayor Wu has made contributions to the local area and should be expressed. Therefore, the proposal to cast statues has been cancelled, and it is planned to rebuild the Mayor Wu Memorial Pavilion in the city center area in the future to leave a memorial. The construction of a statue of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is still actively underway. The small announcement soliciting initiators is extracted as follows: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has been serving the party and the country and running for revolution for more than 20 years. He has repeatedly made extraordinary moves in the Northern Expedition and the battles against the rebellion, and he has been able to exhaust his personal spirit and strength to complete unification and achieve peace, dispel great difficulties, and brave all dangers. Recently, he personally led the soldiers to suppress the communists and eliminate the red scourge, benefiting the party and the country. He has not refused to complain about the abundance of great achievements, and the seas are the same. Mayor Wu was able to maintain local security after the Shanghai case became tragic. He then built the city center area and strived to realize the Greater Shanghai plan. He has made great achievements and is worthy of our worship and respect. Our association believes that Shanghai is the center of our country's economy, politics, and culture, and it is related to the views of all countries. How can we not express it? In order to promote virtue and reward merit and to encourage future generations, we will initiate the construction of bronze statues and memorial pavilions in this city to show respect and to leave a memorial. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is difficult to achieve practical results without uniting all circles and collecting the strength of the masses. We hope that all groups and comrades will actively participate, and the success of this matter can be expected soon.</p>

<h3 id="e118">New Deli North Sea Sand Ship Encountered Pirates in Qingkou Ocean <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Pirate ship opened fire to kill crew members, looted cloth worth 20,000 to 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>The New Deli, a North Sea sand boat, set sail on the 1st of this month and headed to Qingkou, at the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, returning after the fog cleared. It anchored and moored on the shore to avoid the fog. The next morning, as it was weighing anchor, two small boats suddenly sped towards it, firing more than a dozen shots into the sky to stop the ship from sailing. There were more than a dozen pirates on the two boats who used guns to threaten the crew and stop their actions. The captain, Mr. Liu, saw that there were only a dozen pirates and that there were more than 30 crew members on board who could resist. At first, he told the crew to pull up the sail and sail away quickly, but he saw one of the crew members fall to the ground after being shot. He was very frightened and hid in the cabin. Before long, a large three-masted pirate ship arrived, carrying a large gang of pirates. Seeing that there were many pirates, the crew could not risk it and had to stop the ship. The pirates boarded the ship and forced all the crew to stand in one place. The pirates held guns to watch them and searched them one by one. All the silver dollars were looted. They also went to Captain Liu's room to search and smashed open the leather box, looting more than 400 yuan in paper money. After searching, they ordered the ship to sail to the northeast coast of Qingkou to moor. They opened the cabin and forced the crew to carry the goods down to the cabin. Three crew members who were a little late were shot and killed by the pirates. The cloth was loaded onto the large pirate ship and looted for four or five hours. About half of the looted cloth was worth 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Before leaving, they fired several shots and fled east. After the pirates left, Captain Liu sent the accounts clerk to Shanghai yesterday to report to the merchants who hired the ship, and telegraphed Peng Liji, the shipowner in Nantong, to report the situation of encountering pirates.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Gong and Hou Sentenced to Death for Murdering Xie Aqiao <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Hou lost her color upon hearing this, her whole body trembling</p>
<p>Gong Shaoting, a Pudong native and owner of the Hongtai Construction Factory on Gongxing Bridge, Zhabei, was already in his sixties. He suddenly lost his wife when he was helping others get married. He was a carpenter and his income was very small. He lacked the funds to remarry, so he became acquainted with Xie Aqiao, a woman from Changshu (Xie Aqiao was an "Ah Ma" in a Westerner's house and had some savings). They rented a house and lived together for nearly 20 years and had always been at peace. Gong was usually very frugal and hard-working. Around 1921, he became a small contractor and his income gradually increased. He operated diligently and his business prospered day by day. He soon founded the Hongtai Construction Factory. Until recently, he accumulated about 100,000 gold. However, Gong Shaoting was inherently stingy and regarded money as his life. He often refused to lend money to relatives and friends, and he would also delay the wages of workers, so the workers were very dissatisfied. Gong became lecherous after getting rich. In the spring of the previous year, he met Mrs. Hou from the Xu family on the road in Caojiadu. They fell in love at first sight and built a new house. A love affair thus began, and a dismemberment tragedy occurred. The trial of this case has been completed by Zhang and Shao, the judges of the local court, and the verdict is pending. Yesterday, at 11:30 a.m., Judge Zhang took the seat in the 10th court and ordered the male and female criminals Gong Shaoting, Hou, Zhou Baoquan, and Li Baosheng, who were in custody, to be brought to the case. He also pre-assigned 10 court police officers to maintain order in the courtroom. The interrogator first briefly asked each criminal about their age and origin, and then stood up and announced the verdict in court. The main text roughly stated that Hou had premeditated murder and was sentenced to death. Damaging the corpse was sentenced to three years in prison. The sentence to be executed was death. Gong Shaoting premeditated murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Inciting abandonment of the corpse was sentenced to five years in prison. The total sentence to be executed was 14 years. Gong Shaoting did not participate in the destruction of the corpse, and the verdict was innocent. In the part of Xie Baolin's request for private prosecution, the verdict was to repay 180 yuan. The remaining requests of Xie Baolin were rejected. Zhou Baoquan and Li Baosheng were sentenced to one year in prison for damaging the corpse. After the interrogator finished the verdict, he said, "If you are not satisfied, you can file an appeal according to law within 10 days." After Gong Shaoting received the verdict, he claimed, "I don't owe him money, so how can you judge me to pay back the money? Of course I am not satisfied." Zhou Baoquan said, "The boss still owes me half a year's salary, totaling 36 yuan." Hou listened to the verdict but did not understand it. She asked the court police who was standing by, "How many years will the old man imprison me for?" The court police replied that she was sentenced to death. Upon hearing the word "death," her face turned pale, her body trembled, and she wanted to cry but had no tears. She greatly regretted it. The interrogator ordered the criminals to be taken away.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Widow Died Strangely After Abortion <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>To save face, a life was lost; The second landlord stole a receipt</p>
<p>Widow Sun Tang, 40 years old, from Gaoyou, lived in the back building of 21 Chunhongfang, Changchun Road, Xingjia Wood Bridge, Zhabei. Her husband had been dead for more than 10 years. After her husband's death, Tang was alone and went out to work as a helper to make a living. Over the past 10 years, she had accumulated some savings. Recently, Tang worked as a helper in the home of a certain family in the French Concession, and became acquainted with a chief steward named Sun Xiaowuzi. They lived together. Unexpectedly, Tang became pregnant, and her abdomen gradually became larger. She thought that if she gave birth, she would lose face, so on the first day of the lunar month, she went to 42 Zhexingli, Xingjiazhai Road, Qiujiang Road, with Sun Xiaowuzi, to eat vegetarian food with Buddhist grandmother Ma Gu (nicknamed Ma Dajie), and asked her to perform an abortion. She did not know that the surgery was not good. After returning home that evening, Tang died tragically at about 1:00 a.m. the next morning. The lover, Sun Xiaowuzi, saw that he had caused trouble, and immediately fled. The second landlord, Qi Songlin, (who lived in the front building) because the deceased still had a cousin, Jin Guoan, who lived at 41, Lane 189, Changchun Road, so he was called to inspect the deceased's belongings. There were two suitcases, 40 pieces of clothing, and 90 yuan in gold circles and paper money, which were taken away by Jin Guoan and his wife for safekeeping. However, it was recently discovered that the second landlord had stolen the deceased's receipt for 200 yuan that was lent to others. Jin Guoan reported to the Sichuan Road Police Station that the cause of Sun Tang's death was unknown. Yesterday, the reporter Jin Guoan, the second landlord Qi Songlin, the guarantor of the deceased's rented house Li Fengshuang, the abortionist Ma Gu who had fled, Gu Xiaoni, Ma Gu's nephew, and the related person Wan Guirong were summoned and questioned. Because the case was complicated and involved criminal cases, it was ruled that Jin Guoan, Qi Songlin, Li Fengshuang, Gu Xiaoni, and Fang Guirong, a total of five people, should be sent to the third section of the Public Security Bureau's Zhabei branch for dispatch.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Xiamen Road: Drug Den Case Opens <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zonglian is the Alias of Chen Minghua; Wen Zong'e Faces Additional Charges from the Police</p>
<p>On February 8th of this year, an explosion and collapse occurred at No. 48 and No. 46, Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, under the name of Xinglong Yufeng, which was in reality a heroin manufacturing den. Besides the deaths of drug-making workers Wang Yongfu and Ji Jinlong, the den's accountant, Tang Jiejun, and workers Wang Yonggui, Gao Guoqing, and Fan Wenxi were also seriously injured. They were arrested by detectives, who also apprehended Wu Guoxian, Gou Hechun, Chen Zonglian, and Wen Zong'e. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Qian Hongye, the criminal division chief of the First Special Court, continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, presented the case, stating that the police were prosecuting Tang, Wang, Gao, Fan, Wu, Gou, and Chen under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, while Wen Zong'e was being prosecuted under Article 216 of the Criminal Law for obstructing freedom and Article 129 for dereliction of duty. Wen, in his position as an inspector for the Jiang-Zhe Consolidated Tax Bureau, allegedly solicited bribes from Chen Zonglian and was involved in the detention of Chen by the Japanese. Therefore, he was being prosecuted in conjunction with the case. However, the lawyer requested that the drug-making case be tried first, followed by the interrogation of Wen on the charges against him. According to the police investigation, Chen Zonglian was the alias of Chen Minghua, the owner of the drug den. However, Chen only admitted to the name Zonglian, styled Zhaozhong, and claimed that Chen Minghua was not himself. The statements of the defendants were then presented to the court. Tang Jiejun confessed that his real name was Tian Jun, styled Jiemin, and that Tang Jiejun was a pseudonym used to avoid embarrassment. He admitted that he was introduced to the job as an accountant in Zunde Lane by the fugitive Li Ziqiang Hejian, and that all his work was completely under the direction of Chen Minghua. When asked in court if Chen Zonglian, who was apprehended, was in fact Chen Minghua, he replied that he was not Chen Minghua. Wang Yonggui, Gao Guoqing, and Fan Wenxi also testified that they were workers and that Chen Zonglian was not Chen Minghua. Wu Guozhi and Xun Hechun both denied any involvement with the drug den. Chen Zonglian testified that he was a counselor in the 26th Division and denied any connection to the drug den. After repeated questioning by the court, Chen firmly denied being Chen Minghua and hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Fan Gang, and Yu Quncui to defend him. Judge Qian then briefly questioned Wen Zong'e regarding the charges against him. As there was a need for further evidence, the judge ordered a postponement of the trial. Wu Guoxian and Gou Hechun were each granted bail of 2,000 yuan, while the rest were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Guangxi Woman Sues Post Office Employee for Bigamy <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Overruled Due to Improper Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Jiang Bingren from Songjiang, an employee of the International Exchange Department of the Shanghai Postal Headquarters, had a physical relationship with Lu Qiongzhen, a young married woman from Laibin County, Guangxi Province, when he was the director of the Liuzhou Post Office in Guangxi two years ago. Later, Jiang was ordered to return to the Shanghai office to take up his current position, thus separating from Lu. Towards the end of last year, Lu suddenly came to Shanghai from Guizhou Province, demanding to reunite with Jiang. She even went to Jiang's hometown for a time before returning to Shanghai. After negotiations, Jiang paid her 200 yuan to return home to avoid her wandering in a foreign land. Lu also wrote a statement declaring a permanent break and promising never to harass him again. Unexpectedly, before the ink was dry, Lu hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Jiang Bingren in the First Special District Local Court for bigamy, among other charges. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the court for a preliminary hearing. According to Lu Qiongzhen's testimony, she was 22 years old and married Jiang in Liuzhou on August 5th two years ago. At the time, she was unaware that Jiang had a wife. It was not until she came to Shanghai to visit him on December 29th last year that Jiang took her back to Songjiang the next day, where she learned that he had a wife. She was confined to a small room by his wife and daughters. That night, she seized an opportunity to escape, took a car to Shanghai, and stayed at the Asia Hotel in the French Concession, where she negotiated with Jiang. On January 11th, she signed a permanent separation agreement at the hotel and received 200 yuan. She claimed that Jiang had repeatedly sent people to threaten her, and she needed money for travel expenses, so she accepted the money. Jiang then sent her luggage back through someone, but the clothes in the suitcase had been taken, she said. Jiang Bingren testified that he was 48 years old and had been working in the post office for 22 years. He stated that the plaintiff's allegations were pure fantasy and not worth a laugh. He said that in August two years ago, he was appointed to work in Liuzhou alone. Through the introduction of a local bookseller, he hired the plaintiff as a maid, paying her ten yuan a month. Later, he found her diligent and had an agreement in writing, and then they had a relationship, what is called "za pian tou" (cohabiting) in Shanghai. He never agreed to take her as a concubine. He only gave her 200 yuan out of pity for her impoverished situation to cover her travel expenses. The statement was written voluntarily when she had a moment of conscience, he said. The defendant's lawyer presented the statement and the plaintiff's handwritten letter, arguing that the content of the letter clearly showed the plaintiff's character and that she knew that the defendant had a wife. Judge Liu then told Lu that the fact of the bigamy she was suing for occurred in Liuzhou, the obstruction of freedom and theft occurred in Songjiang, and the forced signing of the statement also occurred in the French Concession. Based on the legal proceedings, the case was not under the jurisdiction of the court. For the convenience of both parties, it would be appropriate to file the lawsuit in the Second Special District Court. After the announcement, the judge dismissed the self-accusation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau opened the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital last March at the former site of the Chinese Public Hospital on Tongji Road in Zhabei. The existing wards were not very spacious, so within the possible scope, 64 beds were set up first to temporarily accommodate diphtheria, smallpox, scarlet fever, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, and plague, a total of seven infectious diseases. Experts were hired to oversee medical affairs. At the same time, efforts were made to plan for expansion. In July of last summer, construction began on two new, modern infectious disease wards, as well as one office and one clinic. All have now been completed, and the equipment is new and modern, with extremely thorough isolation and disinfection measures. The new and old wards of the entire hospital can now accommodate more than 130 beds. Therefore, starting from March 1st, the scope of treatment will be expanded to fully accommodate nine statutory infectious diseases. In addition to the original seven, typhoid fever and dysentery will be added. In the future, when the economy is more prosperous, wards will continue to be added to achieve perfection. It is reported that the hospital will officially open this month, and invitations will be sent to all sectors to visit.</p>

<p>According to a statement released by Yongan Textile Company, there are many workers of varying quality in the cloth machine room of Yongan No. 1 Textile Factory on Yangshupu Road in Eastern Shanghai. Diligent workers can produce more than 50 yards of cloth per machine in eleven hours, while lazy workers only produce more than 20 yards. The difference is enormous. In order to improve technology and increase production, the factory dismissed workers with poor skills. These dismissed workers were dissatisfied and wanted to make things difficult for the factory, and attempted to prevent other workers from going to work. However, the workers were not moved, and all of them have resumed normal work yesterday.</p>

<p>For the sake of caution, the Social Bureau allows interested parties who have objections to the marriage of the marrying persons to report to the Social Bureau for review before March 28. However, the marrying persons shall, within five days before the marriage, go to the Social Bureau with the best man and the introducer to stamp the marriage certificate.

At the same time, the Bureau believes that the group wedding is a pioneering event. At that time, the number of spectators will be crowded. Although the city government auditorium is large, it can accommodate at most 3,000 people. Special attention should be paid to the order of the auditorium.

<h3 id="e127">Bitter Condemnation of Zhang Damin in Will: Ruan Lingyu Dies with Grievances; Ruan's Body to Lie in State Tomorrow at Funeral Parlor; Young Men and Women Alike Mourn and Pay Respects <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>—Zhang Damin's Case Continues to Be Heard Yesterday—</p>
<p>Since the tragic news of the movie star Ruan Lingyu's suicide was published in newspapers, not only have Ruan's relatives and friends been deeply saddened, but also those who loved Ruan's art have sighed in unison. The following is a compilation of inquiries into the beginning and end of Ruan's suicide:</p>
<p>Transforming into a Vengeful Ghost</p>
<p>Ruan Lingyu was always passionate. After separating from Zhang Damin and officially cohabiting with Tang Jishan, she did not abandon her former relationship with Zhang, still sending him a monthly allowance of one hundred yuan, totaling two years, amounting to two thousand four hundred yuan. Recently, Zhang learned that Ruan was deeply afraid of litigation, and that her position in the film industry was unsuitable for mentioning past events again. To avoid damaging her reputation, he used a lawsuit as a means of coercion, demanding ten thousand yuan from Ruan. Intermediaries negotiated back and forth, and Ruan had already agreed to pay four thousand yuan, but Zhang refused. It was then increased to six thousand yuan, but Zhang still refused. Ruan, feeling that Zhang was excessively oppressive, said indignantly, "He (referring to Zhang Damin) is truly deceiving people too much. Although I am unwilling to confront him in court in this life, I will transform into a vengeful ghost after death to seek retribution!" However, the listeners did not expect that she would immediately contemplate suicide.</p>
<p>Secretly Taking Poison</p>
<p>At about 11 p.m. on the 7th, Ruan was still at the Lianhua Film Studio, chatting with friends and having a late-night snack together. It was not until about 12 a.m. that she returned to the bedroom on the second floor of her residence at No. 9 Qinyuan Village, Xinza Road. At that time, Tang Jishan had already fallen asleep, and Ruan did not disturb him. However, she had talked about the lawsuit with her mother, saying that there was a 99% chance of winning, but she was afraid of being watched by the public in court. Soon after, she claimed to be hungry and ordered the servant to cook a bowl of noodles to satisfy her hunger. Little did anyone know that Ruan had mixed three bottles of Barbitono Sodium sleeping pills, totaling thirty pills, into the noodles and consumed them, resulting in an irredeemable situation. After taking the pills, she also drank two pots of tea.</p>
<p>Obtaining the Pills</p>
<p>Ruan's body was inherently weak. In recent months, she had been working day and night, exhausting herself in her artistic pursuits, and personal misfortunes had continued to plague her, causing severe neurasthenia. She could not fall asleep every night without taking those sleeping pills. There were originally five bottles at home, but Ruan's mother, to avoid any accidents if she lost her mind, had kept them in her possession. In recent days, Ruan had successively devised ways to obtain three bottles of the pills stored by her mother, and eventually used them to end her life. However, it can also be seen that Ruan's determination to die had been made early on, but it had not been known to others.</p>
<p>Final Comfort</p>
<p>After taking the poison, Ruan wrote two wills, one addressed to Tang Jishan and one to all sectors of society (or it is said that one was addressed to Zhang Damin and the other to Tang, but Tang did not allow it to be published. The other is recorded later). After writing them, she hid them in a drawer, then shook Tang awake and asked if he truly loved her. Tang replied that he did indeed truly love her. Ruan then said, "Please give me some comfort (meaning a kiss), because this is the last time." Tang, seeing that her tone and expression were unusual, quickly got up and comforted her, saying, "Why do you say such things? Have you taken poison?" Ruan pretended to laugh and said she had not. Tang did not believe her and called Ruan's mother, who lived on the third floor, to come downstairs. Ruan's mother entered the room, but Ruan was already unable to speak. It was then that they discovered three empty sleeping pill bottles on the table, realizing that she had taken poison. This was about 3 a.m.</p>
<p>No Way to Recover Initially, Ruan had taken poison once and had been sent to the Japanese Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment and was saved, but that was during the day. This was Ruan's second time taking poison, and the family still followed the same procedure, but they did not know that Fumin Hospital had no doctors on duty at night and that they were somewhat discriminatory against Chinese people. Moreover, it was about 4 a.m. at that time, and it was impossible to find another well-equipped hospital in the northern district. Finally, she was sent to a German doctor surnamed Zhou, and Chen Daming and Chen Jiyao, two brothers who were doctors on Old Bazhi Road, were telegraphed to come for treatment. When they arrived, Ruan was already sleeping on the bed, her makeup still fresh, her slender fingers red with henna, showing no signs of pain. Chen and others immediately used the latest first aid methods, injecting her every fifteen minutes, and performing gastric lavage and enema. She regained consciousness several times, but there was still no hope of survival. She was then sent to the Sino-Western Sanatorium on Pushi Road, using the hospital's ward to perform artificial respiration and oxygen delivery, and immersing Ruan's naked body in a hot water bath, but eventually, due to the delayed rescue, all revival techniques were exhausted, and she breathed her last at 6:38 p.m. on the 8th. According to a doctor, if Ruan had been treated with surgical methods when she arrived at Fumin Hospital, there would have been hope of survival, because at that time the toxicity was still in the stomach and intestines, and had not yet entered the nervous system.</p>
<p>Court Examination</p>
<p>The night before, after the Gordon Road Police Station received a report of Ruan's suicide, they ordered Deputy Inspector Zhu Mengwei and others to investigate, and immediately transported Ruan's body from the Wanguo Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. At about 10 a.m. yesterday, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body. First, the deputy chief of the Western District and others reported the process, and then Tang Jishan stated that he was 41 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong, a tea merchant by trade, and that the deceased was his woman, whom he had formally married. Recently, Zhang Damin had accused him and his wife of adultery and embezzlement, which was actually a false accusation, causing her to suffer this dishonorable matter, resentment, and suicide. Yesterday morning, he returned home and discovered that she was beyond saving, and so on. Ruan He's stated that she was 50 years old, and that the deceased was her daughter. When she committed suicide, she was sleeping upstairs, so she did not know anything beforehand, and now her body was being collected by her husband, Tang Jishan, and so on. After obtaining the statement, Song ruled that the deceased, Ruan Lingyu, was a female who had died of poisoning from an overdose of sleeping pills, and the body was handed over to her husband, Tang Jishan, to collect and coffin it.</p>
<p>Grand Funeral Tomorrow Around 11 a.m., the body was transported back to the Wanguo Funeral Parlor from the examination office. It was then taken to the operating room upstairs for bathing and cosmetic surgery. The date of the grand funeral has been decided for 5 p.m. tomorrow. The obituary has been issued from the Tang residence and sent to Tang and Ruan's friends. The obituary stated that Ms. Ruan was Tang Jishan's wife. In addition to briefly describing the cause of her death, it also stated that the grand funeral would be held at Shen time (3-5 p.m.) on the 11th. Yesterday, Tang's family members were at the funeral parlor preparing for Ruan's final rites. Only Ruan's adopted daughter, Xiaoyu, was inside guarding their residence at No. 9 Qinyuan Village.</p>
<p>Inside the Funeral Parlor</p>
<p>At about 3 p.m. yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency went to the Wanguo Funeral Parlor again to see Ruan's body. At that time, there were many vehicles in front of the door, and there were also many young men and women who were negotiating with the gatekeeper, wanting to go inside to see the body. It was heard that no less than three hundred people had come to pay their respects one after another. Her appearance was even more glamorous than the night before. A dozen flower baskets were placed around the corpse. Underneath, it was hard to resist the feeling of peach blossoms on a human face. Xiaoyu, wearing mourning clothes, was serving beside her mother, with little sorrow, still unaware that this adoptive mother, who had cared for her for several years, was about to part forever. Luo Mingyou, general manager of Lianhua Company, Lin Chuchu, Wang Renmei, Jin Yan, Xu Lai, Xu Qinfang, Liu Jiqun, Yu Guang, photographer Wang Shaofen, dance stars Liang Saizhu and Saisan sisters, Yan Fei, etc., all showed sorrowful expressions. Many of the female stars looked at each other with tears in their eyes. Tang Jishan, wearing a black formal suit, looked dejected, frequently placing flower baskets given by friends and relatives beside Ruan's pillow. Ruan's mother's face was pale, as if she had been crying all day. Everyone was comforting each other. Although Ruan had been separated from this world forever, there were still people who sympathized with her.</p>
<p>Lianhua Telegram</p>
<p>To all newspaper offices across the country, domestic and Nanyang theaters, and readers of Lianhua Films, greetings, Ms. Ruan Lingyu, an actress of our company, suddenly passed away in Shanghai on March 8. All of our colleagues at the company mourn in unison. Please ensure that when your theaters screen Ms. Ruan's works, do not use the unfortunate event of the lady as advertising promotion, so as not to lose the company's consistent pure business and respect for business ethics. Our company's next issue of Lianhua Jin Bao will publish a special memorial issue for Ruan Lingyu. If you have any text to contribute, please send it before March 17. Her last work, "National Customs," has also been completed the day before. The lady's loyalty in serving our company is exemplary. We hope you understand. Respectfully, Lianhua Film Company.</p>
<p>Lianhua Casting a Statue</p>
<p>For the sake of commemorating the lady, all colleagues of Lianhua Company have decided to go to pay their respects in full during the lady's funeral, and hold a memorial service on a regular basis. In addition, the company has decided to raise funds to cast a bronze statue for the lady and place it in the company as a permanent memorial. It has also been decided that the company's colleagues will not send any meaningless elegiac scrolls and flower wreaths, and the money saved will be used for casting the statue. In addition, the film "National Customs," recently starring the lady, has already been filmed. It was recently planned to re-shoot two acts of it, but it is too late. As for the sound film "Spring Comes to the World," which the company was preparing to shoot, it was originally planned to be starred by the lady, and it was about to start shooting, but the lady suddenly became an ancient person.</p>
<p>Two Wills</p>
<p>(1) Now that I am dead, people will surely think that I am afraid of guilt. In fact, what guilt do I have to fear? Because I have never done anything to wrong Zhang Damin. Leaving aside other things, just take the time when I was about to separate from him, I still gave him one hundred yuan every month. This is not just empty talk, there are receipts and vouchers. But he repaid kindness with hatred, and repaid virtue with injustice. What's more, the outside world doesn't understand, and they still think that I have wronged him. Alas, what can I do? After thinking and thinking, the only thing to do is to die. Alas, my death is not a pity, but I am still afraid of gossip. Gossip is terrible. Ruan Lingyu's last words, midnight on the evening of March 7, 24th year of the Republic of China. (2) If I don't die, I can't clear my grievances. Now that I am dead, I can finally fulfill his wishes. Although you did not kill Boren, Boren died because of you. Zhang Damin, I'll see how you escape this public opinion. Now you can't slander Tang Jishan anymore, because you have already killed me.</p>
<p>Trial Opens</p>
<p>Zhang Damin sued Ruan Lingyu, Tang Jishan, etc., for forgery of documents, encroachment, and theft. Although Ms. Ruan Lingyu had committed suicide by taking poison, the Second Special Court still opened the trial at 2 p.m. yesterday. The reason was that the defendant was not only Ruan alone. Since the plaintiff did not withdraw the lawsuit, it would naturally continue. The plaintiff, Zhang Damin, learned of Ruan's death the night before and rushed to the funeral parlor to pay his respects, which caused him to suffer a severe cold, so he was temporarily unable to attend the court for questioning. His attorney appeared on his behalf. The defendant, Tang Jishan, and Ruan's mother, accompanied by their hired defense attorney Jiang Yiping, arrived at the court at about 2 p.m. to report, sitting quietly in the lawyer's lounge waiting for the trial. Tang, who was over fifty years old, looked old and pale, with a short mustache on his upper lip. He was dressed in a Western suit and leather shoes, looking spiritless, due to the excessive stimulation the night before. Ruan's mother, who was about fifty years old, had short hair and wore a black cheongsam, with bound feet and anti-mouth velvet shoes, sitting silently to the side, showing a sorrowful expression. But although Ruan had committed suicide, those who paid attention to the case and went to the court to listen were still very crowded, not diminishing at all, especially women. In the audience seats of the Second Tribunal, there was no space left. The judicial police specially dispatched several policemen to maintain order in the court, which was well-organized. When the bell rang three times, Judge Zhang and the clerk took their seats to hear the case, ordering the court clerk to summon the parties and their attorneys to the case. Tang stood in the defendant's dock. First, the plaintiff's attorney stated that the plaintiff, Zhang Damin, was unable to attend the case today due to excessive cold stimulation, and requested permission to reschedule the date. Questioned by Tang Jishan, who testified that he was 41 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong, residing at No. 9 Qinyuan Village, Avenyi Road, a tea merchant by trade, and had never been criminally punished before. The official said that Ruan Lingyu had committed suicide by taking poison, as reported in the newspaper today. At this point, Jiang Yiping, the defense attorney hired by Ruan and Tang, stood up and declared to the court that after this case occurred, Ruan Lingyu's reputation was greatly damaged in society by the accusations of adultery published in the newspapers, and she was depressed and angry, leading to her suicide by poisoning. In fact, the adultery point was not accurate. Now there are several pieces of evidence and wills that can be submitted to the court for reference. The plaintiff suddenly claimed to be ill today and did not appear, and no evidence was presented, so the request to reschedule the date was unexpected. The plaintiff's attorney said that Ruan Lingyu's suicide, saying that it was caused by being accused of adultery, was just conjecture. Attorney Jiang also stated that Ruan Lingyu and Zhang Damin, in April of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, commissioned Attorney Wu Chengyu to prove and enter into a contract to terminate their cohabitation relationship, which was signed by Zhang in his own handwriting. After the contract was signed, Zhang paid Ruan 100 yuan per month. After the payment of this money ended, this unfortunate case suddenly occurred. Now there is written evidence of the termination of the relationship that can be presented. Jiang also held this evidence in his hand and requested that Attorney Wu be summoned to the case for questioning. Attorney Wu is now in Shanghai, residing on North Sichuan Road, and so on. The official then said to the defendant Tang Jishan, "Since the plaintiff has not arrived today, wait for a scheduled re-summon." He also instructed the defendant's attorney to submit copies of various pieces of evidence to the case at the next hearing. The plaintiff's attorney also stated that although Ruan had died, she had left behind property, which was related to the case of encroachment, and asked whether a disposition could be issued. The defendant Tang Jishan was about to leave Shanghai to do business in Hong Kong, and his whereabouts were uncertain. The court believed that it was necessary to provide bail, and requested that it be properly secured. The court ruled that there was no need to raise it now, and it would be verified at the next trial. The court then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Fruit Company Resolves Dispute over Dismissal of Warehouse Staff <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Xieyuan Fruit Company and others, during the Lunar New Year last year, repeatedly used reasons such as poor business and reduced scope, as well as poor performance of warehouse staff, to dismiss many warehouse staff without cause, causing disputes. The warehouse staff who were dismissed included Qian Along of Xieyuan Company, Cai Bingyao of Chengda Company, Xie Guorong and Lu Zhangfu of Huitai Company, Weng Jiancheng, Yan Xinlong, and Song Tulin of Yongxing Company, Yu Kunyu and Luo Gentu of Taifeng Company, Xiang Asi and Lu Afu of Jicheng Company, etc. They immediately reported to the Fruit Industry Warehouse Staff Association, requesting a transfer report, and the dismissed workers themselves petitioned the party and government agencies for relief. The association immediately transferred the report according to the situation, requesting that the relevant companies be ordered to reinstate all the dismissed warehouse staff to avoid disputes and maintain the difficult situation. At the same time, staff were sent to consult with the managers of the various companies, requesting reinstatement. The managers of Chengda, Huitai, Yongyu, Taifeng, Fucheng, and other companies, after considering the difficult livelihood of the warehouse staff and their special nature, and in accordance with the Municipal Party Department's Notice No. 203, published in newspapers, notifying all industrial and commercial firms not to dismiss workers without cause during the settlement period, so as not to cause disputes, especially reinstating all the dismissed warehouse staff of the relevant companies. The Fruit Industry Warehouse Staff Association and all its members expressed their deep gratitude to the companies that agreed to reinstate them. However, Xu Runsheng, the manager of Xieyuan Company, although repeatedly persuaded and mediated by Commissioner Lu (Jingshi) of the Municipal Party Department, and the Fruit Industry Warehouse Staff Association repeatedly sent staff to consult, was ultimately stubborn and resistant. In order to settle the matter, the labor side followed Commissioner Lu's instructions: (1) Issuing Qian Along with 30 yuan for travel expenses, waiting for work; (2) If there is a vacancy in the future, Qian Along must be given priority to work. It is heard that the labor side's method was purely to follow the Party Department's mediation intentions, receiving money was not their original intention, so they immediately sent the money received to the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Drought Relief in Various Provinces to relieve the victims. The dispute has been temporarily settled.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Rickshaw Pullers Demand Return of Confiscated Vehicle Licenses <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Public Concession Bureau's Rickshaw Affairs Committee confiscated ten licenses and suspended their issuance for half a month and one month due to rickshaw pullers overcharging fares. However, the rickshaw pullers said that they had previously contacted the Vehicle Committee, and in addition to the fare of eight jiao and five fen, they could also charge for the rickshaw puller's meals and rental deposit. Now the Vehicle Committee disregards everything, confiscates the licenses and does not allow them to operate. Therefore, the rickshaw pullers whose licenses have been confiscated have jointly sent a letter to the guild, requesting that they negotiate with the Vehicle Committee to return them.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Party, Government, and Military Representatives Publicly Commemorate Chen Shaobai Yesterday <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Presides, Tong Xingbai and Others Accompany; After the Ceremony, the Remains Are Sent to the Haili Wheel for Transportation to Guangdong for Public Burial</p>
<p>The coffin of Mr. Chen Shaobai, a pioneer of the Party and the country, was transported back to Guangdong by Pingyun. On the morning of the 8th, it passed through the capital, and central figures held a public memorial service in Xiaguan. At noon on the same day, it was attached to the Beijing-Shanghai fourth train and transported to the North Station of this city. The municipal government sent Zhou Guoping to take care of everything. Party, government, and military circles of this city held a public memorial service in front of the coffin flower car at the North Station at 9 a.m. yesterday. At 10 a.m., a coffin transport car was used to transfer it to Jinliyuan Wharf, where it was loaded onto the Haili Wheel, which set sail at 2 p.m. to transport it back to its hometown. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Dispatching Police Protection Chen's coffin flower car was parked at the Songhu branch line of the North Station. A public memorial altar was set up in front of the car. A portrait of Mr. Chen Shaobai was hung on the altar, with fruits offered and candles lit and incense burned. Flower wreaths sent by various circles surrounded it. At the entrance, there was a plain-colored archway made of silk. The military band dispatched by the Municipal Public Security Bureau stood to the right of the altar, and additional police officers were dispatched to stand around to provide protection. The situation was very solemn.</p>
<p>Participating Figures Among those who participated in the public memorial service were Mayor Wu, Tong Xingbai, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Department, Jiang Huaisu, Secretary-General, Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Yang Xiaotian, Director of the Security Office, Li Dachao, Chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government, Wu Shaohui, Deputy Director of the Two-Road Administration Bureau, Xu Yuanfang, Director of the General Affairs Office, Qiao Yisheng of the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office, Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, and other hundred people. Mayor Wu presided over the ceremony, Lin Yannan was the master of ceremonies, Zhou Tongping was the host, and Chen Tongjia read the memorial text.</p>
<p>Public Memorial Situation After Mayor Wu arrived at the venue, he expressed his condolences to the Chen family and began the public memorial service. Mayor Wu, the presiding officer, and Tong Xingbai, Jiang Aosu, Yang Xiaotian, and others, the accompanying officers, stood in front of the altar in order, facing the altar. The family members stood on the right side of the altar. The master of ceremonies stood on the left side, and the reader of the memorial text also stood on the right side. First, the military band of the Municipal Public Security Bureau played funeral music, and the whole body bowed three times to the portrait of Mr. Chen Shaobai. Then, the presiding officer presented a wreath, burned incense, and remained silent. Then, the reader of the memorial text read the memorial text, and the whole body bowed once to the family members. The family members returned the bow, and the ceremony was announced as complete. After the public memorial ceremony was completed, Mayor Wu and others boarded the car to view the coffin. The coffin was covered with flower wreaths and had a portrait of Mr. Chen Shaobai hanging on it. The family members, including Mrs. Chen, accompanied him on the side. Mayor Wu inquired about the situation of transporting the coffin back to his hometown, and the family members answered in detail. Mayor Wu, with other important matters to attend to, took his leave first and changed to a car to go to the Kong residence on West Aimes Road.</p>
<p>Party and Government Memorial Text On the ninth day of March in the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Wu Tiecheng and others, the representatives of the Shanghai municipal party, government, and military, respectfully offer incense, flowers, wine, and sacrifices to the spirit of Mr. Shaobai, saying, "In ancient times, sages and wise men, men of great talent, who intended to accomplish great things in the world, must have had outstanding heroes and heroines assisting and supporting them, planning and strategizing in the command tent, borrowing chopsticks at the side of the ash pan, so that they complemented each other and their merits became more obvious. Yao's relationship with the Four Mountains, Shun's relationship with Yuankai, Tang's relationship with Yi Yin, and Zhou's relationship with Lu Shang, all recorded in historical records, were all like this. As for those who pursue righteousness and do not admire profit, work diligently and do not count their merits, there has never been anyone like you, sir. In the beginning, Xiao He transported grain to Guanzhong, and ultimately revived the Han Dynasty. In the end, Yan Guang resided in the rocky mountains, and even moved the heavenly stars. Li Bi still held the position of Yuanfu, and Zhang Liang ultimately received the reward of Marquis Liu. Sir, your righteousness was deep in friendship, you dedicated yourself to the revolution, your heart was as firm as gold and stone, you personally braved dangers and ran around the seas and skies, secretly planning and raising arms and equipment for thirty years as if it were one day. The Premier regarded you as a teacher and friend, and the Party and the country revered you as a pioneer. Yet you did not speak of your merits and did not accept rewards. After the revolution was completed, you retired cleanly, which can be said to combine Zifang and Ziling into one person, and even surpass them. After the Premier passed away, your contemporaries also withered away. Only you, sir, with a scattered body, leisurely enjoyed the forests and streams, hoping that you could enjoy a long life, and stand巍然as the Lu Temple Lingguang. Then, the bad news came, the old and accomplished passed away, the whole country was shocked and mourned, and the whole world was in mourning. In your case, sir, you rode on Jiwei and traveled in the vastness of the universe. Your bright integrity and noble demeanor are recorded in historical records. The central government has the canon of commendation, and your hometown has the grand funeral rites, which are extremely honorable and leave no regrets. However, in this time of national crisis, we rely on the model of the advanced as a model for the people. The passing of a man is a national bereavement. Now, the Danliu returns south, and the spirit chariot passes through Shanghai. Tiecheng and others bear the responsibility of defending the land, obey the orders of the central government, remember the predecessors, admire the high virtues, and both public and private feelings are intertwined. Seeing the posthumous appearance, we shed tears. Touching the coffin, we swallow our voices. If the gods have spirits, we hope that they will come and be present. Alas, may you enjoy the sacrifice."</p>

The car was filled with smoke, and the ticket seller urgently instructed all passengers to disembark. He then quickly shut off the engine. The smoke and fire were caused by the motor pulley overheating, which ignited the undercarriage. Upon hearing the alarm, firefighters rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire, and the police dispatched officers to control the crowd around the burning tram. As a result, trams traveling east and west were blocked and unable to move forward, from Rue McGibbon all the way to the fire station on Avenue Dubail, numbering more than a dozen, like a long snake.

<p>98 to 18, a new record for the season. Jinan defeats Guanglu with 69 to 19</p>
<p>In yesterday's Jiangda basketball game, Fudan played against Chihchih at the Fudan Gymnasium. About five or six hundred spectators were in attendance, crowding together and cheering from time to time. Fudan was last year's champion and has strong strength. Chihchih has many new players whose skills are still lacking. The game looked like an egg hitting a stone. As a result, Fudan won a great victory with a score of 98 to 18. The magnitude of the score can be described as a new record for the season.</p>
<p>Disparity in Strength</p>
<p>After the referee blew the whistle to start the game, Fudan's Chuan Xiangfu immediately scored three consecutive goals. Chihchih suddenly appeared flustered and helpless, unable to attack and unable to defend. The situation deteriorated rapidly. Chihchih only scored two points from a long shot by its defender Lu Zhixin and managed nothing else. As a result, the first half ended with a score of 55 to 4.</p>
<p>Difficult to Reverse the Tide After the lemon break, Fudan's Ma Kaihua came on and replaced Shen Chongjiao, and the competition became slightly more interesting. However, Chihchih's forwards were inaccurate in their shots, making it impossible to reverse the already reversed tide. Fudan's players scored every time they shot. When the whistle blew, Fudan achieved a great victory with a score of 98 to 18.</p>
<p>Fudan Points</p>
<p>Chuan Xiangrui 31</p>

<h3 id="e146">Tung Wah Still Virgin, Yu You Suffers Another Crushing Defeat with 1 to 4. Both Sides Exhibited Harmony, with Clear and Watchable Moves. The Tung Wah First Division Championship Is Secure. <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Luo Hua and Yu You met again in Yi Yuan on the afternoon of the day for the second round of the Western Football First Division League. Due to the absence of one or two key players, Yu You's offensive strength was weakened. As a result, Tung Wah won 4 to 1, creating a record of 10 wins in the First Division. Yesterday, the weather was mild, the sun was shining, and the spring air was full of joy. There were as many as three or four thousand men and women in red and green in Yi Yuan Stadium. The performance of both sides was clear, and the fans were very satisfied.</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai's Goalkeeping Was Excellent</p>
<p>Victory and defeat are common in military affairs. Sports must emphasize spirit. The performance of Tung Wah and Yu You yesterday can be described as the ultimate in courtesy. As for offensive and defensive operations, they each did their best without any laziness. That is where the spirit lies. Yu You's defense was better than its offense yesterday. Zhang Rongcai's goalkeeping was highly praised. Given time, he will definitely be impressive. Chen Zhenxiang also stood out from his peers. Forward Sun Jinshun was unable to accomplish much alone. Tung Wah's victory was entirely due to the better cooperation of its forwards. The defense was similar, but the offense won. Jia Youliang moved like the wind and was the most energetic. Among the five forwards, Qin Zuo Zhi was the most average because he was inexperienced.</p>
<p>Stalemate Lasted for 40 Minutes</p>
<p>Yu You kicked off. In the first ten minutes, the chances for both sides were very equal. There was offense and defense, with each side gaining and losing. Yu You's Chen Zhenxiang performed outstandingly. Gradually, Tung Wah began to dominate the offense. However, because Qin Zuozhi's movements were too slow, he simply watched the opportunities and sighed. Yu You's Zhong Yongsen also exchanged positions with Liu Zuxiu, making the situation slightly better. Zhang Rongcai was in the limelight. Tung Wah's attacks, which could have scored three times, were all stopped by Zhang. Jia Youliang's shot at the goal was extremely powerful but was also saved by Zhang. Cheers erupted for a time.</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu Unleashed a Cold Arrow</p>
<p>The stalemate lasted until the last two minutes of the first half. Qin Zuozhi got the ball in the left corner. Tung Wah's five forwards rushed forward. Qin passed to the front of the goal. After Dai Linjing got the ball, he passed it to Chen Jiaqiu, who lifted his foot behind the crowd and sent a high ball that happened to fall into the goal. Zhang Rongcai jumped up to catch the ball, but it had already fallen into the net. Tung Wah opened the scoring first. Turning around to kick off in the center, the whistle blew for the break. Tung Wah was ahead by one goal to zero in the first half.</p>
<p>Li Dai Scored Three More Goals</p>
<p>Switching sides to fight again, Yu You used all its strength and made efforts to improve. However, the forwards lacked coordination and were often intercepted halfway. Tung Wah then launched a fierce attack. Qin Zuozhi took a corner kick and lingered in front of the goal. Li Yichen broke through the encirclement and shot powerfully at the goal. The ball hit the corner of the net. In less than two minutes, Jia Youliang selected the center. A Dai took advantage of the opportunity to attack and scored, leaving the goalkeeper with no way to stop it. After a while, Dai got a pass from Qin and scored another goal, making it three goals and a clean four goals.</p>
<p>Sun Jinshun Scored a Goal Back</p>
<p>Tung Wah, without losing a single soldier, scored four consecutive goals, its momentum soaring and its light shining. Yu You's entire army was indignant and determined to retaliate. Sun Jinshun broke through the crowd and crossed two hurdles. When he reached a suitable spot, he waved his iron leg and flew the ball into the net, regaining one goal. Before long, time was up. Although Yu You wanted to counterattack, it could not. Tung Wah won with four goals to one.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Ministry of Education: Interpretation of the Compilation of Educational Laws and Regulations <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has recently issued several interpretations of educational laws and regulations, which are summarized below: A. Regarding matters related to secondary school joint entrance examinations: (1) The Ministry of Education ordered the Hebei Education Department (regarding how to handle students who failed one or two subjects in the senior high school graduation joint entrance examination and have already been admitted to universities, and whether they can transfer schools during the trial study period), stating that students who failed one or two subjects in the senior high school joint entrance examination should be allowed to participate in the re-examination of the failed subjects for a maximum of two times. If they still fail, they should be ordered to withdraw from school. As for transferring schools, it should be approved only after they become official students. (2) To explain the standards for calculating the results of schools participating in the graduation joint entrance examination, the Ministry of Education ordered the Yi Education Department, stating that secondary schools with both senior and junior high school classes should list their senior high school students in the same list as other senior high schools, and their junior high school students in a separate list as other junior high schools. The three proportions stipulated in Article 12 of the joint entrance examination regulations should be calculated separately according to the regulations to determine the percentages of grades A, B, C, and D. (3) To explain the ambiguity in Article 10 of the Secondary School Student Graduation Joint Entrance Examination Regulations, the Ministry of Education consulted the Guizhou Provincial Government (details omitted). Students who fail one or two subjects in the graduation joint entrance examination should be allowed to participate in the re-examination of the failed subjects for a maximum of two times. Those who cannot participate in the re-examination due to unavoidable reasons may be issued a certificate of completion by the original school, stating the grades of each subject in the joint entrance examination and indicating the subjects that were failed. In addition, if the above-mentioned students who failed have already gone to school outside the province, the original education department may entrust the education department or bureau of the province where they are currently studying to conduct a re-examination on their behalf. B. The Vocational Supplementary School Regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education are different from the Merchant Supplementary School Regulations promulgated by the Central People's Movement Committee. The Ministry of Education ordered the Zhejiang Education Department, stating that Article 1 of the Vocational Supplementary School Regulations stipulates that the purpose of vocational supplementary schools is to provide those who are already engaged in or aspire to engage in a certain occupation with knowledge and skills in that occupation. Its sub-discipline methods and curriculum content are different from the general supplementary schools mentioned in the key points of the Merchant Supplementary School Regulations. If various groups or individuals want to establish the aforementioned vocational supplementary schools, they should still refer to the Vocational Supplementary School Regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>C. To explain the qualifications of graduates of one-year normal courses and graduates of public and private secondary schools before the Qing Dynasty or before 1927, the Ministry of Education ordered the Jiangsu Education Department, stating that the following is hereby approved after review: (1) Graduates of one-year normal courses who have served as elementary school teachers for more than one year may be exempted from examination and verification in accordance with Article 78, Paragraph 2 of the Elementary School Regulations. (2) The qualifications of graduates of public secondary schools before 1927 or the Qing Dynasty may be uniformly recognized. However, the recognition of the qualifications of students from private secondary schools registered by the former Beijing Ministry of Education should be handled in accordance with Announcement No. 9 of the Ministry in 1930. The Jiangnan Arsenal Vocational School is a military school, which is different from ordinary schools. Its graduates cannot be exempted from examination for ordinary elementary school teachers.</p>

<h3 id="e158">The National Academic Work Advisory Office Hosted the Press Yesterday <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Director Cheng Zhenji Reported on the General Situation of the Work</p>
<p>—The Employment Guidance Committee Also Held an Inaugural Meeting at the Same Time—</p>
<p>—Important Cases Were Discussed and He Qingru Was Elected as a Standing Committee Member—</p>
<p>The National Academic Work Advisory Office, a national talent coordination agency, has been established for five months. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the office held the inaugural meeting of the Employment Guidance Committee on the ninth floor of the Shanghai YMCA, and at 4:00 PM, hosted the Shanghai press at the same location to report on the general situation of the work. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Establishment of the Employment Guidance Committee</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the National Academic Work Advisory Office held the inaugural meeting of the Employment Guidance Committee on the ninth floor of the Shanghai YMCA, and the first meeting. Those who attended included Cheng Zhenji, director of the office, Yu Tongkui, deputy director, Zhao Enju, secretary, Li Zhaohuan, president of Jiaotong University, Liu Zhanen, president of Shanghai University, Pan Yangyao from the Vocational Guidance Institute, Jiang Wenyu (represented by Yang Chongfu) from the Vocational Education Society, He Qingru, Ou Yuanhuai, president of Daxia University, Cao Yunxiang, Ye Gongchuo, Dai Zhiqian, Wang Zhixin, etc. He Qingru was the chairman, and Zhao Enju was the secretary. Reporting items included: (1) The Advisory Office introduced the employment situation. (2) Liaison methods with domestic and foreign employment agencies.</p>
<p>Resolutions: (1) Revising and passing the rules of procedure for this meeting. (2) Deciding whether this committee should set up an office in Shanghai. It was decided that the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute would be the liaison office of this committee. (3) There are thousands of employment introduction matters. If there is no fixed guideline, it will inevitably take a lot of effort but achieve little results. How should the introduction work be carried out in the future? (4) Unemployment of academic personnel is a common phenomenon in China. Due to limited funding, this office cannot widely establish branch offices, so the introduction work has not been popularized throughout the country. How should we contact and promote domestic and foreign employment agencies? (5) The main task of this office is to coordinate talents so that both supply and demand have appropriate contact. However, in a scattered and chaotic situation, how should this task be carried out to achieve results? It was decided that the above three items would be handled together. A. This office should first contact and liaise with various administrative agencies and local trade associations, and ask them to give priority to employing the academic personnel introduced by this office. B. This office should urge schools above the specialized level that have not organized employment agencies to establish them as soon as possible, and conduct a detailed survey of the employment status of graduates of each school, compile statistics and reports, and provide appropriate introductions. (6) Temporary motion. Committee member Dai proposed to establish one standing committee member. It was decided to elect He Qingru to serve as the standing committee member. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>He Qingru Talks. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency asked Dr. He Qingru, a standing committee member of the committee, about the future work direction of the Employment Guidance Committee. According to him, various methods will be adopted, starting from multiple aspects, to promote and expand the introduction work of the Advisory Office, so as to make all parties have a clear understanding of the Advisory Office, and facilitate assistance and development, to achieve the ultimate goal of talent coordination.</p>
<p>(2) Situation of Hosting the Press</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the office hosted the Shanghai press at the same location. More than 30 people from various newspapers, including Ma Chonggan, Xia Kaiming, Zhu Zhiwu, Yu Jinkang, Zhu Zhongzheng, Hu Hanjun, Zhou Tianqiu, Xue Wubing, Wang Jinqi, and Yu Jiawei, attended. Yang Chongfu and others hosted the event. After refreshments, Cheng Zhenji, director of the office, first reported on the significance of the Advisory Office and the general situation of the work. Deputy Director Yu Tongkui continued to report. Finally, Ma Chonggan and others made speeches. The event ended at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Cheng's Report. Cheng Zhenji, chairman of the National Academic Work Advisory Office, reported on the general situation, saying, "I am very happy to be able to gather with you today. The office has only been established for five months, and the organization is very simple, but the cause is in its infancy and lacks guidelines. Most of the colleagues in the office have no experience in this work, so omissions and errors are inevitable. However, we can only bury our heads and work hard. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly report to you on the meaning of the establishment of this office and the general situation of the work in the past five months. I hope you will give us more advice."</p>
<p>Purpose of Establishment. "This office is a talent coordination agency jointly established by the National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Education. The purpose is to make the supply and demand of academic talents in the country have appropriate contact, so as to achieve the effect of 'getting the right person for the job and the right job for the person.' The country's construction requires talent urgently, and the authorities often have difficulty finding talent, while academic personnel cannot find jobs, and some are under economic pressure and have to choose jobs that are not suitable for them. Based on this understanding, the government established this office to coordinate and promulgated regulations as the basis for handling affairs."</p>
<p>Internal Work. "This office follows the internal work defined by the regulations, dividing it into four items: investigation, registration, introduction, and guidance. I will describe them in order: (1) Investigation, focusing on the supply and demand of talent. On the one hand, we are constantly conducting detailed investigations into the situation of central government, local governments, public and private organizations, cultural institutions, and industrial institutions that need academic talent. On the other hand, we are also constantly conducting detailed investigations into job seekers and employees among academic talents across the country, making records, compiling statistics, and deducing the relationship between supply and demand. The office has now drafted more than 20 kinds of forms and sent them to various public and private institutions across the country for investigation. Due to the wide range, it is feared that it will not be effective in the short term. If the government and all sectors of society actively support it, the progress will be very smooth."</p>
<p>Registration. "(2) Registration includes graduates of schools above the specialized level and specialized researchers. Among them, job seekers should be allowed to register to facilitate introduction, and the office will also register and preserve those who are currently employed based on the information obtained from the investigation, so that they can be checked at any time. Currently, it is estimated that about 1,000 people have been registered for job seeking and employment."</p>
<p>Employment Introduction. "(3) Employment introduction is one of the most important tasks of this office. When society lacks correct standards for employment, it is naturally difficult to proceed. However, this office strives for caution. Unless it is a suitable candidate, it will never introduce rashly. According to the past experience of this office, the social need for talent is extremely urgent, but the difficulty of this office lies in the lack of suitable talent to supply, or the difference in treatment cannot satisfy both parties, or the employment agency simultaneously seeks people in multiple ways and cannot entrust this office exclusively. All of these are temporary phenomena. In the future, with accumulated experience, increased credibility, and a large number of registered people, we firmly believe that employment introduction can be gradually promoted. Currently, those who have been introduced to jobs account for about 40% of the total in technical fields, 35% in education, 10% in general administration, and the remaining 0.5% each in law, libraries, and academic research. The workplaces range from Ningxia in the north to Nanyang in the south. There are about 200 people who have been introduced and are still in contact. The office is also in contact with the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute and entrusts it to handle various matters related to introduction and investigation in Shanghai, which has achieved good cooperative results. In terms of the government, the Executive Yuan has issued a notice to all agencies across the country to employ the personnel introduced by this office as much as possible. In the future, administrative employment will gradually become consistent."</p>
<p>Internship Method. "Related to employment introduction is the internship method formulated by this office. In the past, university graduates often had a wealth of book knowledge but lacked practical experience, especially those who studied practical subjects. As a result, it was not easy to get a more satisfactory job after graduation. In the industry, university graduates are also considered incapable of being entrusted with important tasks, and are even regarded as inferior to factory apprentices. If this mentality is not fundamentally changed, the industry itself and the graduates' career paths will be greatly affected. The internship method of this office allows both parties to have the opportunity to get to know each other. The internship lasts for three months, and both parties can freely negotiate after the expiration. Currently, more than a dozen well-known factories in Shanghai have agreed to accept interns introduced by this office. The Ministry of Railways has also issued a notice to various railway bureaus to do the same. In the future, this method will be gradually implemented, which may also be a way to connect learning and application."</p>
<p>Guidance. "(4) Guidance is limited to job seeking, employment, and further education. This office is preparing to handle it to meet the needs. In summary, the work of this office is multifaceted, meaningful, permanent, and concrete. Its task is not only to solve the current unemployment problem of university students, but also to study the method of coordinating the entire talent, so as to eliminate the contradictory phenomenon of 'everyone looking for a job, and everything looking for someone.' However, its work is closely related to all aspects of society. Only with social cooperation, the assistance of various government agencies, the supervision of the people, and the attention of the press can it be effective."</p>
<p>Yu Tongkui's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Yu Tongkui, deputy director of the office, made a speech, briefly saying that there are two meanings for the office to host the press today: (1) To make the society understand the nature of the advisory agency. The work of introduction and guidance is important, but the investigation is even more important. We hope to achieve the goal of preparing the government to control talents. (2) In addition to hoping that the public understands this office, it is also necessary to make the public understand the pain of youth unemployment. According to the survey experience, the fault lies not in the youth themselves, but in the society creating this phenomenon. In the future, we plan to compile statistics and announce them to the society so that everyone will pay attention. However, the colleagues have limited abilities, and we hope that the press will give guidance.</p>
<p>Ma Chonggan's Speech. Finally, Ma Chonggan from the Shen Bao made a speech, briefly saying that the work of the Academic Work Advisory Office is the cause of all the people, and the responsibility of conveying and promoting it lies with the press. However, I have a few thoughts: (1) Talents are too concentrated. More knowledgeable people come to the cities, and only women and children are left in the countryside. (2) Schools are mostly concentrated in Shanghai, Beiping, and other places. Students from the inland come to Shanghai and Beiping to study, and most of them are unwilling to return to the inland to serve after graduation. Therefore, I hope that the Advisory Office will set up more branch offices in various provinces to investigate talents on the one hand and supply talents on the other hand, so that they can be popularized. Furthermore, those who are employed often cannot enjoy their work. Once they are tempted by material things, their morals are destroyed. The reasons for unemployment are mostly like this. Therefore, I hope that the Advisory Office should also guide them to settle down after introducing employment achievements.</p>

<p>Newly Drafted One-Year Plan for the Future, Discussed Booklists for Self-Study in Various Subjects</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Circulation Library hosted a banquet at the YMCA on Baxianqiao Road the night before last (the 8th) at 7:00 PM for the specially appointed committee members of the library's Reading Guidance Department. Those who attended included Cai Yuanpei, Shen Xinqing, Du Dingyou, Wang Xiaoying, Chuan Donghua, Zhang Naiqi, Cao Zhongyuan, Sun Shiyi, Ding Shujing, Cao Liang, Wu Yaozong, Qian Bohan, Wang Chuntao, Guo Zixun, and others, totaling seventeen people. Li Gongquan, the director of the library, first gave a welcome speech and reported on the work of the Reading Guidance Department in the past year and the plan for the next year. He also put forward the library's reform opinions in various aspects and the booklists of national studies for various subjects compiled by the Reading Guidance Department, soliciting opinions from various experts. After the report, Cai Yuanpei immediately stood up happily and said that China had no libraries in the past, only private collections of books. Although libraries have gradually emerged later, there has never been a library as widespread among the people as the Shen Bao Circulation Library, and there has never been a Reading Guidance Department established to take on the responsibility of guiding people on how to read. Then, Shen Xinqing, an old veteran of the education community and currently serving at the Shanghai Hongying Library, Du Dingyou, a library expert, and Wang Xiaoying, the current principal of China Women's Middle School, gave speeches respectively. Next, Chuan Donghua and Chen Wangdao Sun Shiyi made many valuable suggestions on the selection and reading order in the literary booklist. Next, Du Dingyou briefly said about the booklist, saying that this kind of booklist is also common in foreign countries, and can be roughly divided into two types: one is for those who are initially learning a certain subject, so that readers know what the content and scope of a certain subject is, and the other is for those who are specializing in research to have a systematic booklist. After the meal, because everyone's interest was even stronger, dozens of experts changed to a circular seat, and everyone freely provided opinions. The discussion was still focused on the book list, and the director of the Reading Guidance Department explained in more detail the essentials of compiling the book list, briefly saying that this kind of book list is not the same as the national studies book list opened by Hu Shih and others in the past. They do not care about the actual needs of readers, and only open them subjectively. Now there are about five types opened, but it is only a part of the book list first opened by the Reading Guidance Department, which is also one of the types mentioned by Du Dingyou, and it is slightly more focused on the system. In the future, we also plan to compile some small booklists for various specialized issues. This kind of booklist is valuable in practicality, not in showing off. Compiling booklists is not the entire work of the guidance department. In addition, we have to do abstracts and continuations of various famous works to cooperate with the work of guiding the public to self-study, and not only meet the needs of readers in Shanghai, but also reach out to other places. Next, Zhang Naiqi proposed that the Shen Bao Circulation Library should contact small book stalls on the road and the secondary schools with incomplete libraries, and Ding Shujing said that the library must pay attention to those who are interested in reading but have no money to buy books. For example, there are 15,000 to 6,000 students in the current women's schools for the masses. After their studies, most of them cannot go on to further studies, so they need to have books to read to supply them. Next, Cao Liang said that in recent years, what I have been in contact with are some workers who have been forgotten by people. Their need for knowledge is even more urgent than that of ordinary petty citizens such as shop assistants and apprentices. I hope the library pays attention to this. Wang Chuntao briefly said that the YMCA is preparing to expand the existing library, and hopes that the Shen Bao Circulation Library will help it, and hopes that there will be a considerable connection between all the libraries in Shanghai. Therefore, the chairman asked Du Dingyou to report on the situation of the Shanghai Library. Du continued to report, finally saying that it is quite admirable that the Shen Bao Circulation Library can achieve such achievements in a short period of one year with very limited funds. Finally, the chairman reported on the treatment of the library staff and thanked the experts for their guidance. The meeting ended after ten o'clock.</p>

<p>It was previously reported that the Jiangxi Senior Vocational School and Jiangxi Junior High School in the South City of this city held an English recitation competition to promote English proficiency. It is now heard that the school believes that Chinese is also a major subject, and the current Chinese proficiency of students is very low, and it is particularly necessary to improve it. A Chinese language competition has been organized, and the best texts required by students, as praised by teachers, are posted at the school gate for public viewing. Those posted more than five times each semester are considered "special grade postings," and those posted more than three times are considered "excellent grade postings." At the end of the semester, prizes will be awarded accordingly to encourage them.</p>

<p>— Hanyu</p>
<p>Children! You are all students. But there is no definite boundary between students and teachers. You can be students on the one hand, but you can also be little teachers on the other!</p>
<p>The first condition for us to accept knowledge is literacy. If we cannot read, how can we accept a large amount of knowledge? Even if we get some information by ear, it is very limited. And everyone needs knowledge, so literacy is a necessary tool for everyone.</p>
<p>How few literate people there are in our country! Only two out of every ten people can read. How can such a country accept modern culture? Therefore, universal education is the most crucial task now.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao Xingzhi recently advocated the method of universal education is the little teacher system. That is to change primary school students into little teachers to teach illiterate people, so that illiterate people can read and accept a large amount of knowledge.</p>
<p>From the perspective of children, of course, they are studying; but compared with illiterate people, you are already very knowledgeable people. You are one of the three-tenths of the literate people. You should pass on the knowledge you have gained to the illiterate people, so that the illiterate people can read and have more opportunities to accept knowledge. First, you must educate the illiterate people in your family, and then expand to other families. This is fulfilling your responsibilities. Children! Arise! Strive!</p>

<p>— Ms. Bei Tan</p>
<p>Dear children, look at the name "Little Teacher", how crisp and pleasant it is! If someone calls you "Little Teacher", you must be very happy. In fact, we should know that the name "Little Teacher" is a bit difficult to bear!</p>
<p>Who teaches you to read? Of course, it is the "teacher"! Then aren't the "teachers" teaching you enthusiastically every day? Teaching you how to write, read, do arithmetic, sing, draw, and what games, etc., that's what "teachers" do. It's not like Zhang San who sells sweets, or Li Si who is the doorman at the school, who are worthy of being called "teachers". "Teachers" are very dignified and polite, and they are very kind.</p>
<p>"Little teacher", it's exactly the same as "teacher". However, when people have any doubts or things they don't understand and come to ask you "little teacher", you should answer them with the same sincere attitude that the teacher teaches you; otherwise, you are not worthy of being a "little teacher"!</p>
<p>Although, sometimes you may not be able to answer other people's questions, or perhaps you have never known them before, haha, don't worry, don't say teachers, even saints will sometimes be stumped by people and unable to answer.</p>
<p>"Little teachers" should have noble manners, upright attitudes, as well as decisive, confident, frank, honest, careful, agile, and other advantages.</p>

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Ling and Li are a pair of very close sisters. Ling is two years older than Li, and her grade is one level higher than her sister, so she understands things very well, and she helps her mother with some odd jobs at home.</p>
<p>One day, her mother asked her to fetch a bucket of water. A bucket of water is very heavy, so she asked her sister to help her, and then they took the bucket of water to the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Sister Ling, look, this bucket of water is very clean, but the teacher at school said: "There are many bacteria in it." Is it true?"</p>
<p>"Yes, if we had a microscope, we could take a drop of water and put it in the microscope, and we would see countless bacteria."</p>
<p>"Then let's pour it out! If we boil this water, won't there still be bacteria?"</p>
<p>"Don't pour it out, just boil it. Because when it's boiled, all these bacteria will be killed. It doesn't matter if you eat dead bacteria."</p>
<p>"Boiling, no way! Is there any other way?"</p>
<p>"There are three other methods: 1. Filtration: Use a sand filter jar, which is filled with a layer of sand and a layer of charcoal chips. The water is filtered down from the top, and it is very clean and can be drunk. 2. Distillation: Heat the water, and when the water is hot, it will turn into gas, called water vapor. When water vapor encounters cold, it turns back into water. This kind of water is the cleanest. 3. Chemical treatment: If we want to make a pond of water clean, can we use the previous two methods? It feels too troublesome. We can use chemical treatment. Just put alum and other chemical drugs in a pond of water, and after a while, the water in the pond will be very clean."</p>
<h3 id="e167">Strange Fish <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>Fish are inherently aquatic, but there are surprisingly strange fish, such as "flying fish," also known as shark, which seem to be able to fly into the air like birds, and "tree-climbing fish," which seem to be able to climb trees like beasts. The "Ishuili fish" that live on the seabed have pectoral and pelvic fins that are shaped like feet and walk very fast. This fish often comes out of the water and climbs onto the sandy beach or the rocks of the island to rest, jumping around like frogs. South of Tokyo Bay, when the tide recedes, you can see these fish. Also, in the Ariake Bay of Kyushu, Japan, there is a kind of "Mochigoro" fish that can also jump freely on the sand. The sharks in the South Seas reproduce in large numbers and are particularly strange. When the weather is clear, they will fly to the branches of trees by the sea. If they see someone coming, they will immediately fly into the sea. The "walking fish" produced in India, Australia, and Africa have mouths like frogs, and their eyeballs bulge and are free. Although they are small in size, if they are kept in a pond, they will also climb onto artificial hills. Other examples include the butterfly fish of Burma and Ceylon, which often come out of the water and fly into the air.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Flying Kites <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Spring is here! Spring is here! Children are busy flying kites again with great joy! As for kites, it seems we can talk about them:</p>
<p>Kites are made of paper and bamboo strips, so they are also called paper kites. They come in many shapes, including beauties, goldfish, centipedes, swallows... They are truly colorful and too numerous to mention. The most common one is made of two bamboo strips crossed, with a piece of paper pasted on top, and two paper strips attached below, with a string tied on, and that's a kite! This kind of kite can be bought for just two or three copper coins, but I think children can make a few of their own, wouldn't that be more economical? However, although they are the same kites, because of the skill of the person who made them, some can be raised as soon as they are released, while others cannot be raised no matter how many times they are released. This is because the four corners of the kite are different in weight, so this phenomenon occurs. If the four corners of the kite are uneven in weight, even if it can be raised, it will still tumble!</p>
<p>Larger kites can have a bowstring hung on them. When placed in the air, the pressure of the wind can cause the bow to make a clear sound, which is also pleasant to hear. Some people even light candles on the kites. However, these are not for children to play with. Children are too weak and can only fly small kites!</p>
<p>It is said that kites should be flown before Qingming, because the wind before Qingming is upward, and the wind after Qingming is downward, so you can't fly kites after Qingming!</p>
<h3 id="e170">Children's Science Lecture: The Colors of Insects <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Linyin</p>
<p>Why do insects always have colors on their bodies? Why are their colors all different? These are questions worth studying for us, and they are also interesting questions. But simply put, insects need to have colors for the following four reasons:</p>
<p>(1) In order to defend and attack, the colors on their bodies are often the same as the colors of the places they live in. This kind of color is called protective coloration. For example, the Lissus often lives on the grassland, so the color of its body is green. Although the color of the surface of the butterfly is beautiful, when it is still, it has the same color as the branches. The leaf butterfly produced in Ryukyu also resembles a withered leaf when it is still (Figure 1). After insects have protective coloration, it is not easy for other animals to recognize them, thus ensuring the safety of their lives.</p>
<p>(2) Also for the purpose of defense and attack, the colors on their bodies simulate the colors and shapes of other animals or branches. For example, bees have poisonous needles that can protect their lives, so thin-waisted flies imitate the shape and color of bees. Inchworms mimic branches (Figure 2). This is called mimicry, borrowing the colors and shapes of other animals to protect themselves.</p>
<p>(3) Warning other animals not to invade, special colors are displayed on the body, this color is called warning color. For example, bees have poisonous needles, and ground beetles have evil tools. These insects are not eaten by other animals, so they have a color to warn other animals. Ground beetles have long hairs, bees have colors, and ground beetles are gold-green, all of which are their characteristics (Figure 3).</p>
<p>(4) This function is not only found in insects, but also in other animals. That is the choice of color between males and females. They each have unique colors to attract the love of the opposite sex. For example, the male and female insects of the small purple butterfly and the small gray butterfly all have extremely beautiful colors. The colors of the male and female insects of the leopard-legged mosquito are also completely different, and often the males are more beautiful than the females (Figure 4).</p>
<p>Children, you think, insects are the most humble of animals, but they also have various needs like human beings, do you find it amazing?</p>
<h3 id="e171">Homemade Tank <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Hengjiu Qianzhuo</p>
<p>Explanation children! Do you know what a tank is? This was invented during the European War, and there are many styles. Its only function is to be able to carry guns and soldiers, crawl over uneven places, and destroy enemy trenches. It is the most powerful machine in war. Now someone has invented an amphibious tank, which is even more effective. Children! Here, I will teach you how to make a small tank, okay?</p>
<p>How to make it: First take two thread spools and file them into a serrated shape. Then nail a small nail on the side (Figure 1); then drill two holes in a small piece of wax candle (Figure 2) and connect it to the thread spool with a thicker rubber band, and fasten it on the small nails on both sides (Figure 3); then insert a large nail as shown in (Figure 4), and the machine of the tank is successfully made. Then, according to the length and thickness of the thread spool in Figure 3, make a car body (Figure 5), and add colors and names, and you are done (Figure 6).</p>
<p>How to play: Rotate the large nail on the machine to tighten the rubber band, cover the car body, and it will move slowly. Even if it is placed on a high and uneven place, it can crawl like a real one.</p>
<p>Note: (1) The rubber band cannot be too short or too long, it should be slightly shorter than the length of the thread spool and candle; (2) The rubber band cannot be twisted too tightly, because it is easy to break if it is too tight; (3) Rotate the large nail outward.</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Yellow Cat Also Agrees to Use National Products <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiyuan</p>
<p>Xin'er and many classmates and children were discussing the issue of using national products at home. Xin'er said: "This year is the student national product year. Since we are students, unlike those who have not received education, we should of course use national products; now that it is designated as the student national product year, which is to promote the awakening of students, we should use national products even more; especially we primary school students, everyone likes to buy some toys to play with. If we buy toys this year, we must check carefully to see if they are national products before buying..." While speaking, a big yellow cat raised by Xin'er's family suddenly jumped onto the table and repeatedly called "Miao—Miao—". Xin'er stroked the yellow cat and said: "Cat! Do you also agree to use national products?" The yellow cat seemed to agree and called "Miao—Miao—". Many children clapped their hands and cheered, "The yellow cat also agrees to use national products and repeatedly calls 'Miao'!" Xin'er then said: "This yellow cat of mine not only agrees verbally, but is indeed a practitioner who loves to use national products. I mixed the oriental fish that I mistakenly bought in previous years with rice and gave it to it, but it would leave it and not eat it after only smelling it. It would only eat one or two bites reluctantly when it was really hungry, as if it couldn't swallow it. But if I use fresh national fish steamed and mixed with rice, it eats it with relish and doesn't look up for a long time. You see how patriotic it is! Last year, the import of foreign seafood was reported to be more than 20 million yuan. A group of unpatriotic people only care about their appetite and don't care about the leakage, which is really not as good as my yellow cat." The yellow cat heard the little master call its name and responded as if agreeing and called "Sha—Miao—".</p>

<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>The black man came back and killed another of our friends to feed himself. He slept until the next morning and then went out as he had the first time. Of course, we went out every day to get fruit and grass for food, otherwise we might have died.</p>
<p>We were extremely afraid, and my friends all said they wanted to end their lives voluntarily. But I had a plan and told them about it, and we decided to try it.</p>
<p>I said, "Friends, you know we can find a lot of wood. Now let's make a raft out of this wood and put it on the water, and we can use it temporarily. If all goes well and our black enemy dies, then we can stay on the island and wait for a ship to take us back to our hometown. If my plan fails, then we have to hurry up and take our raft out to sea. I know it's taking a great risk, but none of us want to be the next meal for this man."</p>
<p>Night fell again, and our enemy came back and made another friend into a meal. Then he slept, and as soon as we heard his snoring, the ten of us who were left each took a red-hot iron fork. Then we crawled up to the enemy and stabbed each of his eyes with the iron forks, blinding him.</p>
<p>The pain made him scream; he rose up in great anger, groping around to catch us and kill us all, but we still avoided him. Then he groped for the door and went out.</p>
<p>After he left, we hurried to the shore, got on the raft, and sailed out to sea. We decided to wait until dawn to see if the black man was dead, and if so, we would stay on the island.</p>
<p>Dawn came, and the enemy came with it, but two other people as tall as him came with him. When they saw us, they threw large rocks at our rafts. They aimed very accurately, and all the rafts were sunk except for mine, and all my friends were lost except for two.</p>
<p>We hurriedly sailed back out to sea and spent the night on the waves. That night, a big storm broke out, the sea was very rough, and we were hit by big waves from time to time, thinking that our raft was going to break and sink. By dawn, the storm had passed, and our raft was thrown onto a beautiful island, and we were very happy to find that the trees were full of good fruit.</p>

<p>Amid rumors of spot goods drying up, the price broke through 90 yuan. The Central Bank sold Sterling at midday, and the price gradually fell. After struggling for half a day, it continued to rise by 9.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The gold market continued to rise yesterday, and morale was high. At one point, it broke through the 90-yuan mark, but due to the normal foreign exchange market and hedging sales, it retreated after peaking. Later, the Central Bank injected Sterling, which suppressed morale. Although it rose, it lacked momentum and eventually became weak again. The future is still uncertain. The turbulence in the morning was not as dangerous as in the past, and the market was quite stable. In the early morning, the overseas silver market showed a contraction in British currency and a rise in American currency, and the forward silver price slightly contracted, with both foreign exchange rates increasing. The price of raw gold in London fell by six and a half pence, and morale continued to be high. There were rumors of off-exchange pre-market trading, and it immediately rose to 68 or 69 yuan, then rose to above 70 yuan.

<p>The atmosphere in the Chinese Securities Exchange yesterday gradually flourished. There were signs of short positions being covered or turning into long positions.

Yesterday, from morning to night, the entire morning and afternoon gradually trended upward. The trend was firm and persistent. Short-covering and investment arbitrage trading were active. Although there was a surge of sellers in the market, it was not enough to absorb the large-scale buying. There was a lot of buying of the 16th Series, the 21st, 38th, and 48th Series.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (8th) the New York stock market was divided, with mixed gains and losses. In the early morning, the market was boosted under the leadership of American Telephone and Telegraph Co., as its president, Mr. Keith, stated that the number of telephones installed since 1935 was more than the same period last year, reflecting commercial progress. However, trading remained sluggish, and the enthusiasm of all parties diminished. Automobile stocks rose slightly under the leadership of General Motors, as 98,260 cars were sold in January. The bond market was firm, as the pressure on US government bonds had dissipated. Small exchange stocks showed little change. Wheat rose due to heavy dust storms in the Midwest. The total daily trading volume was 440,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market is stagnant again, but the bull companies are becoming more determined as their positions gradually shrink. They are reluctant to release locked-in profits. However, the overall trend seems to be weakening, coupled with the daily decline in foreign yarn prices. Japanese companies sell yarn whenever the price rises. It is estimated that their short positions amount to 20,000 bales, and they will continue to hedge monthly. The yarn market is under immense pressure.</p>
<p>Few buyers for long-term yarn: Before the opening of the marked yarn market, most people expected the price to rise, as the gold market rose again and there were many rumors in the market. Therefore, the market opened slightly higher, and bull companies continued to buy. However, the market suddenly fell after the second or third sessions. It was said that Japanese companies sold again when the price rose, so the market became loose and flooded. The market closed weak. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5. When the market opened in the afternoon, near-term bulls remained unmoved and the price rose, but long-term yarn prices declined slightly, as spot yarn trading was slightly quiet, so there were fewer buyers. As a result, the prices for near-term contracts rose by 0.4 and 0.5, leveling off. Da Ji continued to sell and add 1,000 bales. It is estimated that Tong Ji sold 1,150 bales, Dafeng 1,000 bales, Changfeng 2,900 bales, Da Ji 1,000 bales, Jinchang 600 bales, and Taichang 400 bales. Jun Chang bought 1,250 bales, Yi Chang 900 bales, Shengyuan 950 bales, Yuanda 550 bales, and Tongfeng 800 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Weak Yarn Sales of 1,000 Bales: Spot yarn sales remain quiet. According to statistics, all gangs bought 985 bales throughout the day. The market is similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of each gang are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market is still weak, because the Indian cotton market shows signs of instability. The price of April and May White Lo Cotton fell below the 240 yuan mark, reaching a new low. The US cotton market also remains weak. However, most people in this city are bullish and are holding tight to their locked-in profits. However, the inventory of cotton is still high. According to the market, 3,000 bales of Indian cotton Pingguoer were traded, but the price and factory name remain confidential for now.</p>
<p>No Change in Zheng Biao: The Indian cotton market opened lower at the start of the marked cotton session. Though continuing to fall by 0.025 Robi to a new low,</p>
<p>US cotton also fell by a small amount of 0.05 pounds, the mood in the market remained tense, and as gold recovered to a peak, reaching above 890 yuan again, buyers increased activity to push up prices. However, due to the selling off of foreign materials when the price of cotton rose, the long term saw a reverse, becoming dull and dropping by 0.05. This was in reality due to the fact that foreign cotton was not in good shape and there were fears that Indian cotton was still declining. The end result was that all contracts fell by 0.1 to 0.15. The market closed flat in the afternoon, but due to the fact that the 6th of July was a general retail holiday, people were more inclined to align for the purposes of risk avoidance, but trade was not flowing through the markets. All contracts grew by 0.05 to 0.15. It was found that the number of Jinxiu sold out was 3,600 dan, Changfeng was 1,500 dan, Xiecheng was 1,200 dan, Yongda was 1,500 dan, He was 800 dan, Tonghe was 800 dan, Changhe was 1,500 dan, Jifeng bought 3,500 dan, Dafu 800 dan, Shenji 900 dan, Yichang 1,100 dan, Suilong 1,700 dan, Yikang 1,900 dan, Yuanyuanchang 1,000 dan, while the highest prices and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e183">Public Tendency to Sell American Cotton <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, due to 1,200 bales of delivery notices for the March contract, bullish investors turned to selling. In addition, foreign firms sold their term contracts, causing each month's price to fall by one to four points. Subsequently, inter-dealer buying provided some firmness, but long-term bullish investors gradually liquidated their positions, leading to a loosening of sentiment. New Orleans and local dealers tended to sell because of rain forecasts in West Texas and Oklahoma. Public demand was flat, and market prices were uncertain. New cotton monthly contracts were very weak due to rumors that the government might hold 5.5 million bales, preventing cotton from being pledged this season. Heisd estimates this week's cotton withdrawals at 183,000 bales, with Liverpool stocks at 316,000 bales. The closing was flat and weak, with spot prices falling by 5 points and futures falling by 2 to 8 points. The British cotton market was sluggish, with spot prices down 2 points and futures down 4 to 5 points. Indian cotton was bought by European exporters, but this was offset by large-scale selling by futures traders and liquidation by bullish investors. Prices later recovered due to cross-buying. Flat Guord Electric fell 2 rupees, and Olaum and Bai Luo Creek fell 2.25 rupees. The original electric record is on the left (dated the 8th).</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on March 8 reported on the cotton market for the week: Foreign advancements have improved this week, but export figures still lag behind last year. According to private investigations, cotton fields are estimated to be between 31.48 million acres and 34.572 million acres. Soil in the southwest is still too dry, while elsewhere, cotton field work has been delayed due to rain or damp soil.</p>

<p>Flour Yesterday, the flour market was quoted based on foreign wheat prices. Chicago fell by 4 points or rose by 8 points, and Canada rose by about 23 points. When the market opened, because the current flour was expensive and sought after, some speculators were anxious to cover their positions, so the highest opening price reached 3.975. Distant months also rose by 1 to 1.5 points. In subsequent trading, as more floating orders emerged, and Nanjing factories sold off, the near-term contracts fell back by 1 point, and the distant contracts fell back by 0.5 points. By the time the afternoon market opened, the trend had stabilized, and trading was sparse. The number of shipments from inland factories had also decreased, but because the exchange rate was unfavorable, most people were waiting and watching. Looking at the future, after a big drop, the rebound has already approached a corner, and it is feared that it will have to hover again. As a result, the current month was slightly down by half a point, April was slightly down by 0.25, May was slightly down by 0.75, June was slightly down by half a point, July was slightly down by 0.75, and August was slightly down by half a point.</p>
<p>Wheat Yesterday, when the futures wheat market opened, trading in all months was quiet. Although foreign wheat saw a slight increase, the gold price was unpredictable, so buyers were not enthusiastic, and prices fluctuated. The current month was up by 1 point, April was slightly down by 0.4, and July and August were each up by 0.23. By the time the afternoon market opened, trading in all months was quiet again, and the market was not the same as in the morning. As a result, the current month did not open, April was slightly down by 0.2, July was unchanged, and August was up by 0.2. The current wheat market, because current flour is very popular, customer sentiment also brought up 0.23. It is heard that wheat from Sijing Nansu Prefecture is 3.8 yuan, wheat from Xinpu is 3.79 yuan, wheat from Yaowan Suqian is 3.74 yuan, wheat from Bengbu is 3.77 yuan, and wheat from Hankou is 3.48 yuan, or 3.45 yuan. Fuxin took 3,000 bags, and Xinda took 4,000 bags.</p>

<p>—Foreign Rice Continues to Flow into the Yangtze River—</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of twenty-seven or eight shipments arrived from various sources (nearly 6,000 dan), and sales were slow. Only Yantai dealers handled five or six hundred bags. The prices of various thick japonica rice increased slightly by a few cents, late rice remained flat, and Du Jian suddenly moved slightly. The market also appeared strong, but the shade change remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-four or five ships arrived from various routes downstream. Various types of rice were sold slowly, the price of white japonica rice fell slightly by one dime, thin rice fell a few cents, and the rest also weakened. There was not much Hakka rice arriving, and demand was scarce. Prices remained stable.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Initially, Nanjing dealers stopped operating, and the market softened slightly. Later, as Yangtze River dealers from Jiujiang, Hankou, etc., arrived to load, the market turned from weak to strong again. Inland sales remained active. This street only handled more than 2,000 bags of Saigon small-grain rice, etc. 4,000 to 5,000 bags were loaded from the Yangtze River, and more than 6,000 bags were handled inland. The digestion of Hakka indica rice has been average in recent days. Yesterday, both inland and this street were active. Although the transaction volume was less than 1,000 bags, most were small retail orders. The market was still lively, and prices also increased by two or three cents.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Soybean Factory Sales Continue Uninterrupted <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market rebounded compared to the previous day. The reason is that cake sales continue uninterrupted, so oil factories continue to demand soybeans. This led to an improvement in prices of three or four cents. Yesterday, it was estimated that more than 3,000 bags of Guide soybeans were handled, with prices at 3.8 yuan and 3.75 yuan. Five carts of Yingzhou soybeans were priced at 3.67 yuan and 3.62 yuan. Five carts of Haozhou soybeans were priced from 3.58 yuan to 3.5 yuan. Three carts of Bengbu soybeans were priced from 3.5 yuan to 3.4 yuan. Over 1,400 bags of Hankou beans were purchased by Wooden Street and inland areas, with prices ranging from 3.45 yuan to 3.3 yuan. Over 700 bags of inland late beans were priced at 3.4 yuan. The market price still remains in a state of high stability and secondary weakness.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Peanut Kernel Market Stabilizes Slightly <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Recently, because the Qingdao market is weak, the Shen market is also soft, and the trend has stabilized slightly. Bangshan kernels were once quoted at 5.95 yuan. Shantou dealers handled one cart, and high-quality goods were priced at 7.23 yuan, but there were few buyers. Yesterday, Xuzhou kernels continued to open at 100 tons, which Guangdong dealers purchased, priced at 5.75 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, the military authorities have been procuring garden galvanized wire, so transactions have been quite prosperous in recent days. However, the arrival of goods is not large, and the exchange rate has also shrunk, so costs have increased. The market standard has seen a rising trend again, with each bundle selling for 3.75 yuan, which is 0.25 yuan higher than before. It is heard that yesterday, a total of more than 600 bundles were shipped to various ports in Sichuan, Jiujiang, and Hankou. It is found that the circulating goods in the market are already scarce, so the internal trend is very solid.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of Indian pig iron in the market was 65 yuan, which has been offered, so the market sentiment feels more firm. It is heard that the reason for this upward trend is due to the impact of the rising exchange rate. It is heard that there are many transactions in foundries, so the market situation has been quite lively recently.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Case of Western Police Officer Beating a Vegetable Vendor to Death <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The China Daily reported on the 7th of this month: "Zhao Liujia, a woman from Shanghai, was selling vegetables on Yichang Road the other day when she was interfered with and brutally beaten by English Western Police Officer No. 62 from the Putuo Road police station, resulting in her death. All sectors of the city are quite indignant about this incident. The Citizens' Federation organized the Zhao Woman Disaster Relief Association at 4 PM yesterday... to conduct negotiations and ensure that the goals of punishing the perpetrator and providing compensation are achieved."</p>
<p>I remember a similar news item a year or two ago: "A lacquerer, Liu Mingshan, was enjoying the cool with friends at the Dagu Wharf when he was suddenly kicked into the water by a Russian police officer, but the Russian police officer said that the lacquerer had accidentally fallen into the water."</p>
<p>In fact, on the Shanghai Bund, the Second Heads and Third Heads bestow small favors—kicks, punches, sticks—on rickshaw pullers, vendors, and coolies; the rickshaw pullers, vendors, and coolies who suffer these indignities not only dare not resist, but also have to kowtow and pray for the foreign lords to forgive them. This is already commonplace and not considered a big deal. However, things did not go as planned: the lacquerer Liu Mingshan "would accidentally fall into the water," and the vegetable vendor Zhao Liujia "would trip over a stone, bleed to death" (according to Police Chief Martin—see the 6th of this newspaper). In reality, everyone knows that the former was given a bath and the latter was knocked down with a club. This is too stimulating. Even people who are used to these tricks will be moved. The lacquerer's matter has passed and will not be discussed, but the Zhao Woman Disaster Relief Association has been organized. We hope to achieve the above goals, and we especially hope that women's groups in this city will rise up to respond to this relief association.</p>
<p>Punishing the perpetrator and providing compensation, even if it can be done, is already turning a big thing into a small thing, because this is not Zhao Woman's personal grievance, but a disgrace to the entire nation! Bai Shi</p>
<h3 id="e194">Mourning Ruan Lingyu <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>While the women's organizations of Shanghai were grandly commemorating the "March 8th" International Women's Day in various halls with fragrant flowers, elegant clothes, joyful conversations, and clear singing, Ms. Ruan Lingyu, the most famous movie star in the film industry, had just taken sleeping pills and was moaning and groaning in the hospital. This is so discordant—of course, the news of women's suicides these days can compete with the lush spring grass; however, because of the shameless pursuit by male brutes, even a big star with a promising future and economic security had to take the path of death. The social significance contained in this seems even deeper.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I read Ms. Ruan's marriage lawsuit, which was enough to make people sick and heartbroken. A woman who ends a cohabitation relationship with a young master still has to pay him a monthly allowance of one hundred yuan; and even after the two-year period has expired, there are still unexpected entanglements. This young master, who occupied Ruan Lingyu's first half of her life with the advantage of money, thought that Ruan Lingyu was his possession, the pearl in his palm; that past cohabitation relationship had permanently tied Ruan Lingyu down for life. How absurd! And the public did not sanction that absurd worm, but instead gave Ruan Lingyu a cold and cruel stimulus. How absurd is this society!</p>
<p>In the true feudal era, there were no men who shamelessly begged women for living expenses. In the true capitalist era, men could ask women for money, but they did not dare to force them through a divorced cohabitation relationship. Only in this era can a divorced man still be allowed to have a reason to preserve his husband's rights, and can he be allowed to be forgiven for begging women for money. This is truly an unnameable and monstrous era!</p>
<p>Even though the era is monstrous, men, while maintaining their capitalist society's monetary advantage of male power, also add the male power of feudal consciousness dug out from the grave to oppress weak women; women have nowhere to escape, escaping into the hell of the ghost world to avoid the hell of the human world. But in the eyes of imperialists, what do men who exert authority over women become?</p>
<p>The monstrous era kills weak women more and more every day and builds a male-centered world more and more every day. We know that the earth is about to sink!</p>
<p>Ms. Ruan Lingyu came from a humble background. Although she has outstanding artistry in the film industry, she is still not "crowned" as queen. Unexpectedly, in addition to her many troubles, she was also forced by brutes day and night, causing her to abandon art and abandon life. Can female compatriots under double oppression not cry out in unison?</p>
<h3 id="e195">How Do We Understand Literature and Art? <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Chuanbi</p>
<p>I cannot elaborate on profound theories here, nor do I intend to encourage many girlfriends to strive to become writers and artists. I simply feel that we should have a correct appreciation of the novels, songs, paintings, music, movies, dramas, etc., that we often encounter in life. Therefore, I would like to propose a preliminary discussion.</p>
<p>In a society where many careers do not allow women to participate, the arts seem to be relatively open to women. Feudal society wanted women to engage in embroidery, poetry, painting, and music because these things could entertain men and cultivate women's gentle temperament. Poetry taught women to be melancholic and sickly, comparing women to flowers and birds, and using all sorts of insulting nouns and adjectives to describe them. At the time, unaware women appreciated and imitated this kind of literature and art, and took pride in it. Most of the artistic fields in the male-centered feudal era originated from this kind of consciousness, and their function naturally lay in creating women's "weakness" and "媚物." Women in capitalist society are no longer willing to lurk in their families. They want to fight for equality and freedom; but the rulers of the bourgeoisie still want to lock them back in their homes, to cut off all their connections with society. In addition to restricting women in politics, law, occupation, and education, they advocate that women should use literature and art as a toy to cultivate their character and pass the time, and falsely claim that women are naturally close to literature and art. This is, of course, an attempt to make women fascinated by literature and art and abandon all due social responsibilities. Therefore, under the rule of the bourgeoisie, poor women are certainly not educated and are forever out of touch with proper literature and art; intellectual women also cannot have proper appreciation because of misunderstandings of art. As for the general noblewomen, of course, they can only receive some obscene and vulgar so-called works of art to satisfy their麻醉欲as媚物.</p>
<p>Now, women's lives are gradually changing with the changes of the times; we want to have direct relations with all aspects of society with the qualification of "people." In the new society, art is not a toy, it is not for people to cultivate their character or pass the time, and we can no longer inherit others' use of it as a tool to fool women. We demand a correct understanding of literature and art.</p>
<p>First of all, we must understand that art is the superstructure of society, and it reflects the basic organization of society at all times. In the feudal era, men ruled the entire society with the heroic postures of lords, nobles, generals, and emperors, so there were poems singing the praises of male heroes, dramas rewarding virtuous women and martyrs, and legends depicting "talented scholars and beautiful women" and "love affairs between sons and daughters." These kinds of works of art represent the central consciousness of the society at that time. It is very possible to produce extremely high-level masterpieces, which not only made people sing and weep at the time, but also can still move people's hearts and show the power of art when they are passed down to later generations. However, when these works of art are placed before us, we must know how to understand them with the eyes of modern people—that is, standing on the position of today's society; we should not follow the ancients to sing, weep, worry, and rejoice as if we were realistic social persons. When we read "Palace Lament," "Boudoir Lament," and countless poems of sexual love, we must recognize from them how feudal women were sacrificed to men, and what kind of weak, deceptively weak, charming, and playful things women are in the minds of men; do not be fascinated by those lingering and secluded resentments, and make yourself so neurasthenic. Reading "Dream of the Red Chamber" requires recognizing that it is a history book of a feudal family, to discover the darkness of the feudal family and the pitifulness and shame of so many women; and to strictly prevent yourself from becoming "Lin Daiyu-ized." Facing the old plays, we must recognize from the stories of those virtuous women and martyrs the methods by which men have been trying to win over women for thousands of years, the viciousness of women, and the tragic history of women's lives with blood and tears for thousands of years. If, after watching "Farewell My Concubine," you openly sympathize and praise the hero and the beauty, then you have been poisoned by feudal art. Treating art with true interest will inevitably be an unrewarding surrender at the foot of art.</p>
<p>At present, we live in an artistic environment of the remnants of Chinese feudal art and the imported bourgeois art of Europe and the United States. Urban personnel listen to the broadcasting of old operas and Suzhou ballads every day, and see the advertisements of foreign movies every day. We are not saying that these works of art should never be appreciated; on the contrary, we should pay more attention to giving them a serious understanding and criticism. The novels and dramas of 19th-century European and American realism and naturalism played a very great task in exposing the sins of capitalism; we should strive to appreciate and identify them. In the works of all famous great writers, there are extremely erroneous views, and there are also many histories that are more accurate than history textbooks. The works of Tolstoy, Turgenev, Balzac, Zola, Maupassant, Ibsen, and Shaw almost help you understand the shape of modern European life more than any other book. In the last ten years of the 20th century, film has become one of the most powerful urban education tools; almost all citizens are directly and indirectly affected by it. "How should we appreciate movies?" is really a topic that modern citizens should have. In particular, there are the most performances of all aspects of women's lives, and we should pay attention to how modern bourgeois film, the most powerful art, educates bourgeois women in obscene decorations and expressions, and how to confuse men; at the same time, how bourgeois men wantonly play with women. —Unreasonable social systems create unreasonable gender relations, and unreasonable gender relations create so much sin and pain; perhaps only movies provide us with so many rich and vivid materials! It is difficult to find correct life guidance in bourgeois artistic products; but when we appreciate them with the belief of exposing ugliness and criticizing mistakes, we can learn something. Many people say that watching movies is just for entertainment, why bother demanding any theoretical problems. This is committing the mistake of separating entertainment from life. People's knowledge, sentiments, consciousness, and living habits are greatly influenced by their usual entertainment; entertainment is education. Drinking poisonous wine from a cup of entertainment will still make people mad and die.</p>
<p>Society is moving forward, and the emerging art is also raising its head and growing. It is gradually possible to seek from the art representing the era an explanation of society and guidance for life. What kind of novels, songs, dramas, movies, etc., can be considered good works of art today? Now is not the time to explore profound theories, but we can try to give readers some basic standards. First, only reality is the yardstick for measuring art; it is meaningless to advertise for the dead ancient times or to ask questions about unfounded fantasies.</p>
<p>Second, we must use the most common facts as the subject matter of typical things. In this world and country of famine and suffering, abandoning the lives of the vast masses and specializing in the jokes and love affairs of the rich and idle is not what we need.</p>
<p>Third, perhaps it is a description of ancient historical facts, perhaps it is a record of the lives of the rich and idle, but its purpose is to help understand the modern world and to expose the work for the masses. That is proper and necessary.</p>
<p>Fourth, if the language that makes up novels and songs or the tools that make up dramas and movies are extremely difficult or expensive, then it cannot become an art enjoyed by the general public; nor is it something we should praise.</p>
<p>Fifth, any sound era's artistic product should not have an erroneous performance of any social problem in the era. If we find incorrect explanations of women in novels, movies, dramas, and songs, we can devalue their prices.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Section 2 From Female Superiority to Male Superiority <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Junhui</p>
<p>The phenomenon of female superiority is not limited to single-celled organisms; it also exists in most invertebrate animals. For example, among spiders, the larger female spider captures and eats the smaller male spider immediately after mating. Bees are a clear example of a female-centric society: male drones are smaller than female worker bees by a third and are far fewer in number. Besides performing the mating task, they only eat honey and do no work. Therefore, beekeepers often kill them!</p>
<p>That being said, the males of many creatures have now evolved to be on par with females, especially in higher animals such as birds and mammals, even humans, where males are stronger and more beautiful than females. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Originally, the sole task of the male was mating, so it was endowed with active and intense sexual desire. It constantly pursues females to provide new genetic elements. However, the female is the root of the species, with the task of preserving and reproducing the species. Therefore, in the male's competitive pursuit, she calmly chooses the male that is beneficial to her species as her mate. This selective mind is a unique instinct of females, completely different from male sexual desire. This female selection has led to jealousy among males, and even more intense competition, which necessitates their physical strength and beauty. It can be said that the reason why the bodies of most higher animals, even human males, are so strong and beautiful is the result of female selection. At the same time, it is also the reason for the history of male evolution from an amorphous testicle to a one-jin head.</p>
<p>However, in the general animal kingdom, this so-called male superiority does not mean male dominance. For example, the peacock's elegance and strength are not meant to dominate females; on the contrary, they are meant to win the selection of the female peacock. That is to say, the female peacock still retains her right to choose. The female remains the dominant one.</p>
<p>We often hear the following arguments for male superiority:</p>
<p>'Men's brains weigh one jin, while women's brains weigh eight liang.'</p>
<p>'Men can kill cattle, while women can only kill chickens!'</p>
<p>These are undeniable facts, but Mr. Walter, the author of the female-centric theory, also tells us the following more accurate facts:</p>
<p>'The female is the root of the organism, and the male is a derivative.'</p>
<p>'The most primitive male is an amorphous testicle, a small worm with only reproductive organs and no nutritional organs!'</p>
<p>If both of the above are true, then the current male with a one-jin brain must undoubtedly have evolved from 'an amorphous testicle.' But how can an amorphous testicle transform into a manly man with a one-jin brain? This is a very interesting question, and our task is to investigate this mysterious evolutionary process of men.</p>
<p>Walter's female-centric theory correctly solves the problem of the superiority of men and women in biology. According to his research, all organisms have the sole and absolute task of species reproduction, species preservation, and species propagation, and the executor of this task is the female. Therefore, it is said that the female is the root of the organism.</p>
<p>Originally, the reproduction of organisms does not necessarily require the existence of males. That is to say, in the biological world, in addition to sexual reproduction, there is also a wide range of asexual reproduction methods. For example, so-called fission reproduction, budding reproduction, spore budding reproduction, and spore reproduction do not involve fertilization. Although these asexual reproduction methods do not distinguish between males and females, biologists commonly determine the female based on the producer of offspring. For example, in the case of fission reproduction, the terms 'mother cell' and 'daughter cell' are often used. From this perspective, organisms can reproduce without males. But why did males emerge to take on the task of fertilization? The reason is simple: life not only needs an increase in quantity but also needs a qualitative improvement in vitality. To continue its prototype and to obtain beneficial changes in its organization, vitality is leaping in all directions. Due to the law of survival of the fittest, the beneficial method of so-called fertilization was discovered. Fertilization is nothing more than using the mixture of dissimilar substances to develop the individual's life to a higher stage. Thus, male fertilization is not a fundamental necessity for reproduction but a secondary method that arises for the beneficial evolution of organisms. In reality, the number of organisms that practice sexual reproduction is less than half of all organisms.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, males are something derived mid-way, and the meaning of their occurrence and existence lies entirely in performing the task of fertilization. Therefore, in some lower organisms, the entire body of the male consists of testicles, with no nutritional organs and no ability to survive on its own. It dies after completing the fertilization task. In some parasites, the female is thousands of times larger than the male. In humans, the female egg is three thousand times larger than the male sperm. Let's look at an interesting discovery by Darwin. He said, 'Barnacles are only female, but the two shells that bear them have two small pouches, each containing a small husband. Even more interesting are hermaphroditic barnacles, which, although they themselves possess both sexes, also carry several spare little husbands, even up to seven little husbands!'</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Life of Women in Italy <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— (Italian Correspondence) (Wanfang)</p>
<p>Under the slogan of 'Women return to the home, work is left for men to do,' what the actual life of Italian women is like is worth introducing to us.</p>
<p>There are currently more than 1.13 million registered unemployed workers in Italy, of which women account for about 241,000. However, these are mostly official statistics. The actual number of unemployed people is much higher than the numbers above. The number of unemployed women is especially high.</p>
<p>In order to carry out the anti-factory employment of women movement, the Italian government is currently engaged in the following work: (1) Reducing the value of women's labor and reducing wages to the smallest possible amount; (2) Placing the burden of unemployment on the shoulders of women, because unemployed women are not entitled to any benefits according to the rules.</p>
<p>The wages of female rice harvesters (more than 180,000 female agricultural workers only do seasonal work) have been reduced from 25 lira (Italian currency) in 1925 to 9.60 lira (1933). In southern Italy, the wages of female agricultural workers have been reduced to only two and a half lira a day! (To let readers know the real value of Italian wages, it should be compared to the fact that a kilogram of bread costs one and a half to 1.90 lira.) These are still the formal wage reductions in the pan-fascist wage contracts. In reality, the degree of wage reduction is much lower than mentioned above.</p>
<p>In addition, the wages of working women are constantly being reduced because the wage contracts already contain several rules that allow employers to exploit them as much as possible. For example, the wage contract in the textile industry (the textile industry employs most of the workers in Italy—600,000) stipulates that wages can be reduced by 25%—50%, stipulates that there can be compensation for progress in weaving (obtained from reducing the wages of female workers), and finally, stipulates that the wages of young workers, who make up the majority in factories, cannot exceed 60% of the wages of adult workers.</p>
<p>In their difficult lives, some have courage. For example, in the Asiya Ge area, women and their children organized a demonstration against the forced membership of workers in the pan-fascist party.</p>
<p>In the You Ting area, a large group of women went to the mayor to demonstrate because their right to relief was deprived. Many leaflets had been distributed beforehand. Although there were heavy police guards, the demonstration was finally successful, and their demands were victorious.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Interview with Mr. Yu Qingtang <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Everyone who has lived in academic circles must know of a person named Yu Qingtang.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu is one of the earliest promoters of mass education in China, and also a prominent scholar. For several years, she has been diligently working on her educational work. Her stories are practical and down-to-earth. She is not like the so-called women's movement leaders who like to boast, sing high-sounding tunes, and shout slogans... This is also well-known to her friends.</p>
<p>This time, because the Women's Education Center on Hualong Road in this city opened, she rarely made the effort to come and attend in person, despite the long distance. Therefore, the reporter made a special trip to interview her for three minutes.</p>
<p>That day, Mr. Yu was wearing a light gray cloth robe, and outside, a bean-colored woolen coat. She looked very simple and sincere.</p>
<p>After the reporter waited for her to finish speaking on the stage, I went over to tell her my intention, and with her permission, we had the following pleasant conversation.</p>
<p>'Mr. Yu, what is your opinion on the issue of 'women should return to the home'?'</p>
<p>'My personal opinion on this issue is this: Women are also citizens of the country, just like men. Women must not give up their responsibility to the country and return to the home to do trivial things—in fact, after the industrial revolution, a large number of women have already been forced by life to participate in social production activities. It is impossible to go back. So, I always feel that Mussolini's opinion is a bit too extreme.'</p>
<p>'What about the recently debated hair-growing issue?'</p>
<p>'This is a very small issue.' Mr. Yu couldn't help but laugh. 'In any case, I think this is a freedom that everyone should have. There are many, many big problems in China today that urgently need to be solved by the authorities. The authorities don't need to worry about such small things.'</p>
<p>'Mr. Yu, what do you think should be the future direction of women's education in China?'</p>
<p>'Women's education is the same as everything in the entire education issue. It is also regulated by the social environment. Therefore, it seems very difficult to find a path for women's education alone. Assuming that the entire education issue can be solved one day, then women's education will naturally no longer be a problem. So, the current effort should still be based on solving the entire education issue as a prerequisite.'</p>
<p>At this time, someone from the Women's Education Center came to discuss other matters with her again. The reporter felt it was inconvenient to worry her any longer, so I bid farewell and left.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Life of a Widow's Hall <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>Several years ago, I visited a widow's hall. This widow's hall was an affiliated business of a charitable hall. The buildings were built in the courtyard of the charitable hall. The main entrance opened into the inner courtyard of the charitable hall, but this main entrance should not be opened, and it could not be heard three or five times a year. This not only showed that the widows living in the hall could not go out, but also guaranteed that they would not have extra-curricular activities. On each side of the wall on both sides of the door, there was a round hole with a diameter of more than two feet. A rotating barrel with a side opening was installed in the hole. The barrel could not only hold things, but also seat a twelve- or thirteen-year-old child. If something happened, the widows trapped inside the door only needed to turn the barrel with their hands. The door of the barrel would appear, and the objects or children would be placed in the barrel. Then, the barrel would be turned again, and the door of the barrel would appear in the outer inner courtyard. Therefore, these two rotating barrels were the main traffic routes for the widows in the hall to transmit messages and communicate with the outside world. As for the inner letter rooms, they were buildings connected one after another, with board walls at the bottom. Each room had a number, and each number lived in a family.</p>
<p>Although the widows living in the hall were complicated, we can roughly divide them into two types based on their motives for entering the hall: one is to solve non-life problems, and the other is to seek fame. Because once a widow enters the hall, in addition to the monthly money issued by the charitable hall to solve her own life problems, her son can live inside until he is two or three years old, and her daughter can live until the day she gets married. Each child can also receive half of the adult's monthly money inside, and the children can also go to the charitable hall's free school to study. Isn't this equivalent to solving the entire burden of life?</p>
<p>As for the second type of people who seek fame, they are of course widows from wealthy families. Their motives for entering the hall can be roughly divided into three: first, those wealthy families who have plenty of food and clothing have a young widow gathering at home. Needless to say, the honest ones, if they are a bit coquettish and cunning, will become a great concern for both the mother-in-law's family. As a result, everyone can only try their best to find a way to get her into the hall. In this way, not only will there be no scandals, but it will also be a matter of reputation among the villagers. Second, some young widows want to get out of this family prison by entering the hall because the husband's family is large, the population is large, and the family rules are strict. Third, some female sages who live in this world but have ancient hearts are entering the hall to preserve their chastity and pass on their fame for generations.</p>
<p>In addition, I also want to talk about the life in the hall and the current rules and procedures for entering the hall.</p>
<p>Widows can only be released outside twice a year, with a term of five to seven days each time, except for special accidents that require leave - which is very difficult to approve. These two times are the Qingming Festival in March to sweep the tombs and the Zhongyuan Festival in July to worship the ancestors. Their daily life in the hall is quite free. The food is taken care of by each person, and each family takes care of its own. Water is supplied by the public. There are two female servants in charge of purchasing and selling goods for the public. There are rich and poor people in the hall, so their lives are also different. In addition to making clothes and shoes for themselves and their children, poor widows mostly take on outside work, such as making shoe flowers, sewing clothes, embroidery, sewing sheep dung heads, drawing whips, and other light handiwork. What about the rich widows? Everything they should do themselves can be done by paying poor widows to do it, and they always want to secretly play cards.</p>
<p>When it comes to the rules and procedures for entering the hall, in addition to the express provision that the age must be below 30 - that is, the younger, the more qualified - the rest is difficult to say. Because on the one hand, it is not like a school recruiting students, posting advertisements and brochures, and outsiders have no way of knowing. On the other hand, it seems that nine out of ten people who have entered the hall are illegal. Because we know that the reason for establishing the widow's hall is nothing more than the good intentions of gentlemen to 'maintain morality' and 'care for widows'. However, in fact, none of the women who can enter the widow's hall do not have a deep relationship with the head of the charitable hall (general manager) or the big donors. It is even easier for rich people to enter the hall. As long as they immediately donate hundreds or thousands of dollars. The gate of the widow's hall is tightly closed to young widows who are truly poor and helpless!</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we want to ask young widows who are truly poor and helpless, if the gate of the widow's hall is open to them, is it possible for them to maintain their chastity? Under this transactional marriage system, the general situation of Chinese society, no matter which village or town, if there is a young widow in a poor family, the mother-in-law, uncle, or sister-in-law, nine out of ten of them will try their best to remarry (that is, resell) the poor widow. Even if the widow herself is willing to keep her chastity, it is impossible. Mr. Lu Xun clearly expresses this situation in his novel Blessing. When Mrs. Si heard that Xiang Lin's wife was forced by her mother-in-law to marry out in shame, she said in surprise;</p>
<p>'Oh, such a mother-in-law!' However, the old woman Wei replied</p>
<p>'Oh, my lady! You are really too big a household, what is this considered among us mountain people? She has a younger son, who also has to marry a wife. If she marries her, there will be this sum of money to use as betrothal gifts?' Therefore, being a chaste woman and keeping a widow is not something that everyone can do.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Talking About Economic Principles <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Song Xudong</p>
<p>The 'economic principle' mentioned here does not refer to the general principles in economics, but to the lawful principles of simplification, saving, and convenience. This term 'economic principle' is known to anyone who has studied a little philosophy as Mach's so-called new invention. In Mach's philosophy, the original meaning of 'economic principle' is that all knowledge, concepts, and knowledge of objective things can only be attributed to the synthesis of subjective sensory elements. It is not an objective reflection, and the possibility and opening form of this sensory element and its synthesis are innate principles pre-existing in sensation and experience. Our knowledge and knowledge can only be obtained and absorbed based on these prior world elements, and can only be based on it. There is no so-called external world, objective, in its view, and it does not know. This means that in recognizing this matter, only sensory awareness is the only existence. All complex external worlds can be economically reduced to the synthesis of unique subjective sensory awareness, and the synthesis of this sensory awareness can be economically reduced to prior world elements or principles. How simple, economical, and convenient is this! Although Mr. Wang Xinggong praised him in his Methodology of Science, saying that "We study science to obtain the effect of thought. Mach regards thinking economy as the only duty of science, which is indeed insightful remarks." But we feel that Mr. Wang not only did not see the idealism and fideism of Mach's philosophy, but also equated Mach's economic principle with the intellectual economy in science. This may be a mistake! We also feel that in the process of human cultural progress, there is indeed a so-called economic principle, but it is something that has nothing to do with Mach's so-called economic principle. Because the former is metaphysics or even fideism, while the latter is scientific.</p>
<p>The development of human knowledge, its certain knowledge system and laws, before its formation, requires the efforts of many people to succeed. Not only in terms of number, a law must go through countless practitioners, countless scholars, intentionally or unintentionally, from the infinite complexity of facts, to experience, observe, think, and experiment, in order to extract a principle and set it as a law, but also in terms of time, it often takes many times, either short or long. For example, from the simple fact of heat generation by friction, it is possible to derive the law that heat is a kind of motion and energy conversion and non-reduction, but from the barbarians who knew to use wood or stone to generate heat by friction to get fire, they could not draw this scientific conclusion. Moreover, even after the Renaissance, when science had begun to flourish, the theory of phlogiston or caloric was still prevalent in the 18th century. Only until the 19th century did many scholars constantly experience, observe, think, and experiment, knowing that heat is a kind of molecular motion, knowing that the mechanical motion of friction can be converted into heat, and that the motion energy of friction is not lost in vain, but is transformed into heat energy. In this way, we can know how uneconomical thinking and labor are wasted in the formation of a principle or law. However, in the uneconomical efforts of the predecessors, a knowledge system, a principle or law, was obtained and passed on to future generations. Therefore, in the continuous exploration of the objective world, future generations do not need to go back to groping around blindly, and go back to repeating the experience, observation, thinking, and experimentation of the facts already included in this principle or law. Instead, they can directly adopt the principle or law to regulate new materials and facts, and move towards the path of new truths. In this way, we can truly say that this is a true principle of intellectual economy, because it can indeed make us economize thinking, economize labor, and economize time. For example, in the calculation of circumference and sphere, after knowing that the constant of π is equal to 3.1416, when calculating any circumference and sphere, we only need to substitute this constant.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>That is, there is no need to calculate it again. Other examples include the gas pressure law formula in physics, the law of universal gravitation, atomic weight in chemistry, natural selection and survival of the fittest in biology, and the materialistic historical laws in sociology. As long as we know them once, when we need them in the future, we don't need to repeat the calculation, investigation, reasoning, and comparison from each event. We can easily and economically use it to explore and discover new truths. Science is the entire legacy of human knowledge. It can enable future generations who inherit this legacy to economize their thinking and labor in continued research. Scientific laws are the economic principles of human thought.</p>
<p>Not only is there such an economic principle in thought, but also in the process of human production and material life, there is also this economic principle; all inventions from ancient humans to the present are economic principles that can save our labor when we fight against nature and overcome nature. Because if we cannot use the inventions of our predecessors, and have to invent things ourselves to deal with nature, it will not only cost too much effort, but also will not be able to achieve large-scale results. The predecessors invented fire, which can enable us later generations to easily soften and cook rice and vegetables, and soften iron for easy manufacturing; the predecessors invented boats, which can enable us to cross rivers and seas without effort. Otherwise, we would have to spend more energy and time chewing when we eat, and we would have to waste a lot of time and energy to grind raw iron into tools. It would be almost impossible for us to swim across large rivers and seas. Modern people have invented machines to replace manpower. The ease and rapid effectiveness of single planting and saving do not know how much physical strength we have saved in production. What is this if not the economic principle? If we go further, the development of science and production, which is the speed of nature, time and space, allows us to economically use it through the gifts of our predecessors. Before there were steamships, trains, and airplanes, the matter of going around the earth once seemed to us a very large space, but now we are equal to shortening and shrinking it, and we can economically pass through this space within a week. In terms of time, it probably took several years to walk in the past, but now it can be done in a week. Telescopes make planets that are hundreds of millions of miles away seem to be right in front of you for you to observe. Wireless telegraphs and wired telegraphs can allow you to receive news tens of thousands of miles away in a few hours. Isn't this time and space being economically used by people?</p>
<p>In short, the development of science and the progress of human production are all about making our lives and thinking economical and simple. This is the economic principle of science, not the metaphysical economic principle of Mach. Humans are pushed forward in this economic principle, and culture can only develop in this economic principle. Without the effect of this economic principle, humans would still be in the barbaric stage, unable to have much thought and rich lives. Therefore, both spiritual and material civilization originate from this economic principle.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Bleached Bones <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Recorded by Ms. Juan</p>
<p>Female Fortune Teller, Hongmei, Speaks</p>
<p>I was born nineteen years ago, in a spring, into a "respected family" of Wu Shu in Changhong. On the day I was born, the whole family was filled with an indescribable joy. Although the idea of valuing boys over girls was still deeply rooted in our family, I was my father's only daughter after seven years of marriage, so they couldn't help but make a fuss over me.</p>
<p>My father was a simple and honest middle-aged man, and his life could be described as peacefully living a plain life. All the internal and external affairs of the family were handled solely by my mother. Although my mother was a woman with outdated ideas, her knowledge, experience, and worldly wisdom were much higher than my father's. A family of thirty people, all income and expenses, were all under my mother's control. It must be said that this required considerable talent.</p>
<p>I grew up in such a family environment, and the happiness I enjoyed at that time was indeed something I cannot express in words now. My father was willing to not ask about family matters, but he would never neglect my living environment. In his daily life, he spent a small portion of his time reading, and the rest was almost entirely spent playing and laughing with me. I can say that my father's life had no wild celebrations, nor did it have any worries.</p>
<p>My father abandoned his wife and daughter and left this world on a winter night. At that time, I was only a six-year-old child. Seeing my father's stiff body, I didn't feel any sadness at all. Later, seeing the mourning of relatives, it aroused my tears.</p>
<p>Since experiencing this excessive grief, my mother's body gradually weakened. Before, her love for me seemed very faint on the surface because my father was by my side all day. But after my father passed away, she loved me even more than when my father was alive. She didn't allow me to be apart from her for even a minute, and she wanted to bring me by her side for almost everything. In those two years, my nature gradually changed from innocent and charming to weak and shy.</p>
<p>The family situation deteriorated day by day, as if the god of happiness had died with my father. When my father passed away, all the funeral expenses were sustained by selling dozens of acres of land. In the following years, misfortune came one after another, and my family's fields were transferred to new owners year by year. My mother, in this environment of losing her husband, her young daughter, and the dissipation of her family property, her flesh and blood body withered away day by day like an oil lamp.</p>
<p>The day my mother's life ended was when the people of the entire city of Wuchang were making their final struggle with death. The warlords in the city were still stubbornly resisting the righteous revolutionary army outside the city. The intense artillery fire from both sides... constantly... There were always a few that landed on the edge of my house.</p>
<p>After dozens of days of fierce warfare with flying flesh and blood, the gates of Wuchang finally opened. After this unprecedented catastrophe, the scene in the city was as desolate as if it had been washed by water. People's faces were covered with a veil of excessive hunger, and they were taking their wives and children to leave this harsh environment one after another.</p>
<p>In that group after group of fleeing people, there was also a small life. At that time, the person who walked out died miserably, and now they have entered another world.</p>
<p>The misery that the past ten years have given me could have been avoided, but when faced with the reality of today, I can't help but be touched by the sweet illusions of my childhood life!</p>
<p>The fact that I embarked on this path of life in the world now seems like a dream. I remember that I started learning "the art of judging people" from Mr. Lingqing in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. The person who introduced me was the one who brought me out of Wuchang. On the day I became an apprentice, I was still an eleven-year-old child. At that time, not to mention not understanding what learning "the art of judging people" was all about, even daily life like eating and dressing was still taken care of by Mr. Qing.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Qing did not have children of his own, I was able to enjoy the treatment of a daughter while being a student. She cherished me as much as if she had raised me herself, and she educated me, creating the foundation for me to learn "the art of judging people."</p>
<p>I started "practicing my art" since the year before last. In these two years, since I opened shop and became famous, more and more people have come to me for fortune-telling every day. From ten o'clock in the morning to twelve o'clock at night, I rarely have a chance to rest. In the twelve hours of fortune-telling time each day, there are probably more than ten customers. Among these many customers...</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>...Of course, there are many who come with difficult questions seeking a resolution, but there are also those who have ulterior motives under the guise of fortune-telling.</p>
<p>Speaking of this fortune-telling profession, people who don't understand the inside story generally think of it as a free life with abundant income. But the hardship of the dark side is something that people wouldn't believe even if you told them. Especially when it comes to our income, that is an issue that gives everyone a headache. The price for one fortune-telling session is two yuan. If you have ten customers a day, you'll have an income of twenty yuan. This is naturally a rare reward in general women's professions. But while our income is large, our expenses are also considerable. The hotel room costs two yuan a day, and there are also advertising, leaflets, and living expenses, which cost at least ten yuan a day. When it comes to the end of the month, sometimes there isn't even ten yuan left over.</p>
<p>Speaking of the issue of placing advertisements, it reminds me of an interesting incident. Once, after my photo advertisement was published in the Shen Xin newspapers, many people called me the next day to ask why I published my photo at the same time as the advertisement. I hesitated for a long time about this question, and finally answered them like this: "I didn't have any other intention in publishing this photo. It's just that we are freelance professionals, and in order to make it easier for people to recognize us, I published the small photo along with it. If you must say there is another intention, then what about the many movie stars who provide their photos for people to sell for money?"</p>
<p>Those who called had nothing to say and hung up the phone. But in the following days, most of the young people who came to me for fortune-telling were "the drunkard's intention is not in the wine". My "Tai Xiansheng" turtle-fishing customer later replaced it with a different advertisement. That advertisement showed a human skeleton specimen, and below it was written: "No one likes this skeleton, but after an X-ray of Hongmei, it is no different from this skeleton. My ambition is to resolve people's fortunes and misfortunes, not to use my appearance as a deceptive facade..."</p>
<p>A few days after this advertisement was published, all the customers who came for fortune-telling were coming for fortune-telling. The experience that this fact gave me seems to make me feel that although this society is so cruel, as long as you have a method, you can still change it.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Instructor <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Lin</p>
<p>Because of a friend's introduction, I once worked as an instructor at the Shanzhou branch of the Longhai Railway Union in Shanzhou, western Henan. Before I "took office," I had seen the beautiful Western-style houses where the section chiefs and supervisors of the railway lived in Zhengzhou and Luoyang. I had also seen the not-so-bad meeting places of the railway unions in these places, so in my imagination, the Shanzhou branch's building would definitely not be too bad. However, when I arrived in Shanzhou and was led to the entrance of the union by a member of the branch's standing committee, I almost couldn't believe my eyes. The sign of the union was not hanging on a building, but on a rather large cave! I stood at the entrance of this cave, looked up, and, heavens, above the cave was a dirt cliff about ten feet high, with a large crack about three or four inches wide. It looked like it was about to collapse! I was stunned at that moment and didn't dare to go in, but the standing committee member said:</p>
<p>"This is the union, please come in!"</p>
<p>Since I was already here, what else could I do? I thought for a moment, then risked great danger and resolutely walked in.</p>
<p>You probably won't believe it, but in that cave, there was a large rectangular dining table, a first-class desk, and seven or eight chairs. The sloping walls on both sides were covered with things like "All under Heaven is for the Public" banners. The inner layer of the cave was the bedroom, with two beds. Although the entrance of the cave was not very wide, and there were certainly no windows on either side, the light was very sufficient. Even the inner layer of the cave was not very dark. If I hadn't seen from the outside that this was a cave, I would have thought it was a not-so-bad office of some kind.</p>
<p>The standing committee member and I sat down next to the dining table. A young errand boy, probably about twenty years old, poured two cups of tea. Then the standing committee member pointed to me and said to him:</p>
<p>"This is Instructor Zhang, specially sent by the general union. You must listen to his instructions in the future!"</p>
<p>After we talked about the situation of the union here, the standing committee member took his leave and left. Only the young errand boy and I were left here. Because the air was very quiet, it made me think of this cave again. I didn't know why the union wasn't set up in a building, but had to dig such a large cave to use as a meeting place. So I asked the young errand boy. According to him, this cave wasn't newly dug, but already had a history of three or four years. Most of the people here, outside of the station chiefs and supervisors on the railway outside the city, lived in such caves. It wasn't just the union that was set up in a cave. Moreover, this cave also had its special advantages, namely that it was warm in the winter and cool in the summer. So some people were even willing to live in a cave rather than in a house. This was indeed a strange story that I had never heard before.</p>
<p>At night, just as I was about to take off my clothes and go to sleep, I suddenly heard the sound of a whistle. A train was coming from the west, passing over the railway above the cave where I was staying. The entire cave shook, and the dirt from the top of the cave fell down with a rustling sound, scaring me out of my wits. I instinctively ran out, looking at the crack above the cave, which seemed to be gradually widening. "Oh no, it's about to collapse!" I couldn't help but shout. But the young errand boy laughed inside the cave, slowly came out, and said to me:</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang, don't be afraid! The cave won't collapse. Look, aren't these people all living in caves?" He pointed at the people living on both sides of us.</p>
<p>The train had already passed, and the crack above the cave was still the same as before, and hadn't widened. It seemed like it wouldn't collapse immediately. So I calmed down and walked back in. Although my heart was still beating nervously, fearing that I would be buried alive in this cave tonight, since I was already here, what could I do? I had to resign myself to fate and stay here temporarily.</p>
<p>My salary was thirty-three yuan per month. Where did this money come from? It was quite embarrassing! All the union's expenses and my salary were paid by the workers. According to the general union's regulations, 1.5% of the workers' monthly income was extracted as expenses for each branch union. That is to say, a worker with a monthly salary of ten yuan had to take out fifteen cents for the union. Therefore, my main job was to urge the workers to pay their dues on time. In the first month or two after I arrived, it wasn't difficult to collect the dues. Once it was due, the workers from all over would pay the dues. But later, problems gradually arose. Some even didn't pay their dues for several months. For those workers who didn't pay their dues on time, I could still go to those nearby to ask for them. But there was no way to deal with the railway workers in places like Mianchi Guanyintang! They were one or two hundred miles away from Shanzhou, and I couldn't go to them to collect dues often. Therefore, later I just let it go, and those who really couldn't pay their dues were just counted as unpaid. Fortunately, the union's funds could still be maintained, and there wouldn't be too many problems.</p>
<p>Workers often had conflicts. As long as they couldn't resolve them privately, they would come to the cave to "file a complaint." This was the most difficult thing to handle. Because those workers were very straightforward, you couldn't use diplomatic means to say good things to both sides when commenting on their conflicts. That would make them say that you were weak and unfair. You had to clearly point out who was right and who was wrong for them to be convinced and say that you were fair and selfless. However, it wasn't easy to judge their right and wrong. If you made a mistake, you might even be scolded as a "confused idiot." However, I was still a "talented" person, and I handled several disputes between the workers without any major mistakes. So they treated me quite well. Whenever they had free time, they would run to the cave to talk to me about "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Water Margin", chatting about this and that, or playing chess. Sometimes they would even invite me to drink a couple of glasses of baijiu and have a great time.</p>
<p>In this way, although I was living in a cave I had never lived in before, becoming a "cave-dwelling savage," I didn't feel lonely in life. The only thing that made people not very happy was that whenever a train passed over the cave, the cave would shake greatly, and the dirt on the top of the cave would fall down with a rustling sound, making you immediately feel the terror of "being buried alive in the cave." I remember that one night, it snowed heavily all night. When I got up the next morning, the snow outside the cave had accumulated one or two feet high, and the top of the cave was also covered with thick snow. The young errand boy went out to take a look for a while and said: "What heavy snow! When it snows heavily, the caves are dangerous! But our cave isn't afraid!..." "When it snows heavily, the caves are dangerous!" After hearing this warning, I couldn't help but feel a little nervous again. I thought, I haven't enjoyed the happiness of life yet, I haven't fulfilled my responsibility yet, if I were to be buried alive in this cave, it would be too unworthy. - The more I thought about it, the more terrified I became, the more panicked I became, as if the cave was about to collapse immediately. So I hurriedly packed my luggage and resolved to leave this dangerous place. When I was taking the train back east, I was still thinking in my heart: Has that cave collapsed? Has the young errand boy been buried alive? Are the people living in the caves there still safe?</p>

<h3 id="e203">Classicism in Literature <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Sheng</p>
<p>A segment of Chinese literary researchers have traditionally interpreted European literary trends in the past with a mistaken preconception. This preconception stands upon the position of formalism, relying on the terms "classical" and "romantic" to assume that "classical" possesses feudal characteristics and "romantic" represents the nature of the common people. Consequently, they argue that classicism reflects the consciousness of the feudal aristocracy, while romanticism signifies the literary trend of the emerging citizenry. Before 1930, this mistaken preconception resembled a self-evident truth. Whenever discussing past European literary trends, people would express this preconception in a formulaic manner, with few questioning it. It was only when Friche's "History of the Development of European Literature" was introduced to China that some individuals abandoned this erroneous preconception and embraced Friche's theory. However, many others stubbornly clung to this mistaken view. Not long ago, Mr. Ye Qing made an arbitrary claim in the inaugural issue of "World Literature" that classicism was feudalistic. This assertion was theoretically refuted, but no response has been seen to date. This is widely known. Yet, it is not surprising that someone like Mr. Ye would commit such an error. What is most astonishing is that some new literary researchers, theorists who guide young people in their study of literature, still operate under this preconception, asserting that classicism is feudal. For instance, in his "Two Different Romanticisms," Mr. Xin Ren, while accurately elucidating romanticism, still remains under the sway of this preconception...</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>...stating that classicism is the "artistic form of the feudal system." Similarly, Mr. Yin Geng, in "Reading Life," not only claims that classicism is feudal but also asserts that "all previous eras were feudal societies" (see Mr. Yin Geng's "What to Write? How to Write?" in "Reading Life," volume one, issue seven). In light of these facts, we believe that it is still necessary to discuss what societal consciousness classicism represents.</p>
<p>First, when studying modern European literary trends, we must understand the Renaissance movement, as this movement emerged from the collapse of medieval feudal society and the development of commercial capitalism. To investigate the growth of the modern citizenry, one must understand the Renaissance movement, as it marks the beginning of the modern citizenry stepping onto the stage of history and striving to fulfill its historical tasks. Literature is a product of society, and the dominant and developing literary trend that appears in a particular era must reflect the consciousness of the dominant and progressing social stratum in that era. During the Renaissance, the medieval feudal society had collapsed, and the nature of society had become commercial capitalism. The commercial citizenry occupied a dominant position in all aspects, including culture. Therefore, the culture and literature of the Renaissance were those of commercial capitalism, not of feudalism. This culture and literature are the origins of modern culture and literature. It is no coincidence that scholars have traditionally begun their study of the development of modern civilization and modern literary trends from the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Classicism is a literary trend that arose with the Renaissance movement, triggered by the advancement of commercial capitalism. In fact, in 17th-century Europe, due to the development of commercial capitalism, the growing citizenry naturally strongly opposed the politically fragmented feudal system for the sake of trade convenience. What they urgently demanded was a strong, centralized political system. Consequently, absolute monarchical autocracies emerged in some European countries at that time. The demand of the growing citizenry, as reflected in literature, was an absolute classicism that valued reason, upheld discipline, opposed novelty, and depicted general human nature. Therefore, Friche believes that classicism reflects the worldview of the growing citizenry. The poet Boileau, in his "Art of Poetry," which is considered the "textbook of classicism," not only urges writers to "observe the nature of mankind with the eyes of reason" but also advocates respect for reality and truth, arguing that "there is no beauty outside of truth, only truth is worth loving." Such views are clearly not possessed by the theologically inclined, decadent feudal aristocracy but rather represent the consciousness of the growing citizenry. To say that classicism is a reflection of feudal consciousness is clearly a mistaken view that is inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>If we examine the societal consciousness expressed by several great classical writers in their works, the issue becomes even clearer. Corneille, the first classical writer, strove to attack feudal society and serve the growing citizenry. Racine was Corneille's successor and also a literary representative of the citizenry. Balzac, in his depiction of Roman citizens, even offered such praise: "He knows no national bonds, nor personal inclinations. He is devoid of vanity and greed. He would rather eliminate tyranny than share power with it. In him, there exists the courage of a hero, and on his face, there is stamped a great mark." Finally, there is Molière, the great creator of comedy, who in his plays worked to revive "the king who suppressed the powerful feudal lords." He depicted feudal nobles as "arrogant," "cold-blooded," "hypocritical," and "immoral" characters. He used the mouths of peasants to protest to the nobility, saying, "Do you think that just because you are a noble, you can freely seduce our wives in our place?" At the same time, he even used the servants of nobles to scold the nobles as dogs and demons. (Please refer to Chapter 3 of Friche's "History of the Development of European Literature.") Thus, if people cannot deny these facts, cannot deny that Corneille, Racine, Molière, and others expressed in their works the consciousness of the growing citizenry, which is not feudal thought, then to say that classicism is the "artistic form of the feudal system" is an irrational statement based on a misunderstanding of history.</p>
<p>Finally, we must especially draw people's attention to the social conditions and cultural situation of Europe after the Renaissance. We know that the European society after the Renaissance was a society in which commercial capitalism was developing. The cultural characteristics of this period were absolutism, humanism, naturalism, and classicism. Classicism is a combination of absolutism, humanism, and even naturalism. If classicism is said to be feudal, then absolutism, humanism, and even naturalism are also feudal. However, no scientific historian would regard absolutism, humanism, and naturalism after the Renaissance as feudal things. Naturally, the "citizenry" in our statement that classicism is a reflection of the worldview of the growing citizenry does not refer to existing entrepreneurs and bankers but rather to commercial citizens similar to those in the Greek and Roman eras but more advanced. However, regardless, commercial citizens are still citizens, and certainly not feudal lords. Therefore, the statement that classicism, which expresses the consciousness of commercial citizens, is feudal is still incorrect. At the same time, if we acknowledge that the commercial citizens of the Renaissance and later were more advanced than those of the Greek and Roman eras, then the classicism of the Renaissance and later, which reflected their worldview, was not simply a revival of classical literature from the Greek and Roman eras but a further development. It is the initial stage in the development process of modern civic literature. The reason why people regard classicism as a feudal literary trend is because they do not understand what the Renaissance was about, because they do not understand the European social conditions, cultural situation, and the essence of classicism after the Renaissance.</p>

<h3 id="e204">After Reading "Modern" "Innovation Issue" <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Ou Renzheng</p>
<p>The recently published "Modern" Volume 6, Issue 2, in their own words, is a transformation from a literary magazine to a cultural magazine, and looking at the content of the entire magazine, it does indeed have the flavor of innovation. They are able to grasp the reader's heart, confidently offer commentary on reality, and provide easily understood explanations of profound theories that are generally desired by readers.</p>
<p>The short reviews in the "Modern Forum," such as Fuquan's "Handwriting Movement," "Sixty Percent Off Books" (This year is not the year of translation, it should be the year of sixty percent off), "Saving the Nation by Studying the Classics," and Shao Wen's "Why Are There No Great Critics in China Today? A Humorous Dead End," all grasp these important topics in the current cultural sphere and provide deep criticism.</p>
<p>In the political, economic, and cultural essays, Wei Ming's "From the Franco-Italian Compromise to the London Agreement" explains the process and content of these two major events and then discusses them, grasping the conclusion that the major European imperialist powers currently have a temporary and considerable reconciliation, which was successfully achieved under the unity of anti-Soviet Russia. Qian Zefu's "Characteristics of the Current Stage of World Economic Panic" points out that the so-called "improvement" in the current economic panic is only due to the development of "military industry," and the poverty of the people has not disappeared. Qi Qisheng's "The Core Problem of China's National Economic Development" is a review of the arguments of Independent Review. He criticizes the views of Tao Xisheng, Jing Chao, Liang Shuming, Gao Jian Si, and Zheng Linzhuang, considering their ideas as a tangled mess, and advocates taking rural revitalization as the core, but he only criticizes and has not yet presented his own concrete proposals. Fu Yisheng's "Where Is China's Publishing Industry Going?" analyzes China's publishing industry from the perspective of social changes and points out future trends.</p>
<p>In the "Popular Academic Lectures," Shao Wen's "The Value Problem of Literary Works" is, in my opinion, the best, and Wang Tefe's "The Worldview Derived from Electron Theory" is the most important. The former comprehensively discusses the relationship between content and form in the value of literary works, with clear analysis and thorough discussion. The latter, because in Chinese cultural circles, natural science is observed apart from society, now he actually integrates electron theory with worldview.</p>
<p>Several "Essays" allow readers to relax after reading some difficult essays, and the authors are also veteran writers such as Yu Dafu, Xu Weinan, Chen Zizhan, and Zhao Jingshen.</p>
<p>The handwriting vocabulary is the best arranged in this magazine. For example, "Taibai" arranges the vocabulary into two columns, which is very inconvenient to review. Here, it can be torn off and placed at hand for review.</p>
<p>Wang Jicong's "On Liang Shiqiu" in the "Writer Theory" is a strenuous essay. He peels Liang Shiqiu layer by layer, exposing what kind of thing the so-called humanism of Professor Liang and others is. But two photos of Liang Shiqiu and Babbitt are missing (because they pay close attention to illustrations, this is really indispensable here).</p>
<p>The two creations, Chen Shuxun, seem to belong to a new writer, but the "Tragedy of the Food Stall" published here also exposes the "chaotic change of occupation" of farmers and the continued lack of solutions after the chaotic change of occupation, and also writes about the injustice of the poor towards rent collectors, and says "I will fight you to the death." The technique is also very good, and he is a promising author.</p>
<p>Among the three "Book and Newspaper Reviews," Li Huaqing's "Introduction to Chinese University Student Diaries" has the least attention-grabbing title, but the content is worth noting. He is not introducing a book, but writing literary theory. Hui Xian's "Hu Translation of Pre-Qin Classics" is very enjoyable to read. It is a shame that the translator has such a thick skin to publish this kind of translation, and there will also be such an irresponsible publishing house to publish it.</p>
<p>The writers in "Women's Issues," Bi Yao and Bi Yun, seem to be female writers who often write for the "Female Voice" weekly and "Women's Garden." I think the issues they talk about should be more realistic. There are many realistic women's issues that need female writers to speak for themselves.</p>
<p>"Youth Life Guidance" has a very cautious attitude and is a very beneficial article for young students.</p>
<p>Cultural news is very rich, which is a small feature that can attract people to read.</p>
<p>But I have several dissatisfactions. (1) According to the "Innovation Issue" selling for three dimes, and the normal price being two dimes, the future length will be reduced by one-third. If this kind of comprehensive cultural magazine is reduced further, several parts will have to be reduced, which will inevitably disappoint readers. (2) The cover paper is too thin. Although it does not need to be as luxurious as "Human World," it must be thicker for preservation. (3) In terms of arrangement, it is too economical with paper. Each long article should start on a new page, and each column should start on a new page. Otherwise, it is too petty. To run a big magazine, you must have a big ambition. Readers will naturally flock to a magazine with such content. (4) In terms of content, there are still some important practical problems that the editors hope to pay attention to and present for discussion. I wonder if the editors and publishers of "Modern" can humbly accept my humble opinion?</p>

<h3 id="e205">The Holy Land of Confucius <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Qing</p>
<p>When the train was just about to pass through the middle section, Qufu Station arrived. Tourists who are preparing to visit Qufu, when getting off at Qufu Station, usually first inquire: "Where are the Confucius Temple and the Confucius Cemetery?"</p>
<p>The Shandong locals will earnestly tell you: "Not here! It's still eighteen li away from here. Go east from the station, turn the corner, and you'll reach Qufu County, and you'll know."</p>
<p>We, who are new to Qufu, can be considered to have found the direction from here. We followed the local custom, walked east from the station to the main road, and each hired a sedan chair, with a fixed price of eighty cents. So the mules pulled the sedan chairs, bumping and shaking, driven by the coachmen. As we experienced this feudal style on the journey, we idealized the ancient scenery of the so-called Holy Land of Confucius even more. At this time, a strong anticipation arose in our minds, eagerly looking forward to admiring the scenery of the Holy Land. After passing through two villages, I shouted: "Ah! I can see it. At the edge of the distant woods, there are two yellow roofs. Among the green and dark villages, that solemn and grand building is revealed: this must be the Dacheng Hall of Qufu County, right?" I guessed while asking the coachman. The coachman said: "Yes, the yellow roof seen from here is the Dacheng Hall of the Confucius Temple. Those two large buildings were renovated by Zhang Zongchang at the expense of money. The one in the back is the shrine of Confucius' wife; the one in front is the Dacheng Hall."</p>
<p>Continued on page five</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>The mule cart traveled quickly, and after advancing another village, we saw the city walls of Qufu again: in contrast, the magnificence of the Confucius Temple became more prominent. Just looking at the horizontal form of the city wall, one can deduce that Qufu is at least a first- or second-class county town. However, if you look down from the Dacheng Hall of the Confucius Temple, you can see at a glance that the entire Qufu county town seems to be decorated for the Confucius Temple. After the mule cart passed through another village, I asked the coachman again: 'Where is the Confucius Cemetery?' The coachman said: 'Hey! Haven't you seen it yet? Outside the city—outside the North Gate, that large forest garden two li away from here is it. Look at that very long wall! The tombs of the Confucius family from past dynasties are buried inside; Confucius' tomb is there and...it's worth a visit.'"</p>
<p>Bumping along the yellow earth road for about an hour. In an instant, our mule cart had arrived at the county seat. After entering the city and getting out of the car, we first went to the county government to visit a friend. At twelve o'clock, we went to visit the Confucius Temple together.</p>
<p>Coming out of the county government, passing through several winding street corners, the uneven streets end at the South Gate of Qufu County. Turning the corner from the South Gate, there is a flat lane, with a memorial archway erected in the middle with the words "Que Li" written on it. "Ah! This is Confucius' hometown! Are there any remaining historical sites now?" I asked. A friend who had lived in Qufu for many years said: "There's nothing much. Even the archway you just saw was built at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Going through the gate in front is the Confucius Temple." As he spoke, we walked into the gate of the Confucius Temple.</p>
<p>The Confucius Temple is grand and magnificent. There are many ancient trees inside, arranged around the overlapping and winding pavilions and corridors, which is indeed much greater than many other Confucian temples. From north to south, starting from the Dacheng Hall and ending at the gate, it divides the city of Qufu into east and west sections. There are many steles in the temple, mostly inscriptions left by emperors and famous scholars of past dynasties. In front of the Dacheng Hall is the "Apricot Altar" relic, which is a stone tablet, covered by a spacious pavilion, with an ancient tripod placed in front of it, surrounded by some ancient trees. Most of the people who visit this place like to take pictures here as a souvenir. In addition, what is especially worth remembering is the Dacheng Hall. The architecture of the Dacheng Hall is indeed magnificent, no less than the "Hall of Supreme Harmony" in the Qing Palace in Beijing. Inside the hall, there is only one Confucius statue, which is very solemn. On the left and right are ceremonial items and ancient musical instruments, covered with a thick layer of dust. Ten stone pillars carved with dragons are arranged in front of the hall, each with a diameter of more than three feet. The stone is fine and firm, and many tourists caress and embrace them, and their patterns and luster are also beautiful and lovely. It is said that Westerners once offered to buy them at a very high price, but were rejected by the descendants of Confucius, so they are still preserved to this day. This is certainly a valuable treasure with great artistic value in the Confucius Temple.</p>
<p>After visiting the Confucius Temple, we went out of the city to the Confucius Cemetery. The road from outside the North Gate to the Confucius Cemetery is very wide and neat, with ancient cypresses lined up along the way. There are even more trees in the Confucius Cemetery, but unfortunately, more than half of them have been cut down, and the newly planted ones have not yet become forests. It is said that due to the difficult lives of Confucius' descendants, they had no choice but to cut down a lot of them. The houses in the Confucius Cemetery are relatively simple. Inside, in addition to the overlapping and displayed inscriptions of past dynasties, there are relics of the elm tree planted by Zigong. This is a dry wood about ten feet high and about two feet thick, standing upright on the ground, covered with a small house, surrounded by glass, and you can look straight in from the window. People who don't know that it is a historical site often mistake it for a police guard post, thinking that the gardeners guarding the Confucius Cemetery are inside! Sigh! About a few hundred steps north of the cypress trees is Confucius' tomb. There is a simple stele in front of the tomb, but it has been weathered and cannot be seen clearly. The tomb mound is not very large, and blue trees and other miscellaneous trees are planted on all sides, and the tombs of Confucius' descendants are lined up in the vicinity, but they are all terribly desolate.</p>
<p>After visiting the Confucius Cemetery, we visited the Yansheng Duke Mansion next to the Confucius Temple with the introduction of the county government. The Yansheng Duke's name is Kong Decheng, and he is the 72nd generation descendant of Confucius.</p>
<p>We waited at the gate of the Duke Mansion for about twenty minutes before the receptionist of the Yansheng Duke Mansion came out to lead us to visit the Duke Mansion. In addition to the relics and items of the Kong family listed, we also took a walk in the garden. Although the rocks, flowers, and plants inside were good, it was a pity that they were not very neat. After looking around, I was led to sit down in the reception room. At this time, the Yansheng Duke was led out by his teacher. We saw that his demeanor was very solemn. It is said that he is not yet sixteen years old, but his demeanor is enough to show that he is knowledgeable and courteous. The friends who went to visit with us told us that the people of Qufu call him the "Living Sage." After the receptionist introduced us one by one, a friend began to ask the Yansheng Duke about his life and his interest in learning, but for some reason, he did not answer. However, immediately, the teacher who accompanied him spoke up and said: "The Yansheng Duke is currently in the period of studying, and I am afraid that he cannot answer the inquiries of the guests in detail. I can answer one or two as appropriate. In addition to reading the books of the sages, the Yansheng Duke also learns English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The Yansheng Duke is the main body in the mansion, and the management of finances is the responsibility of the steward; in addition, there are also special personnel responsible for medical care, teaching, and managing the Confucius Temple and the Confucius Cemetery..."</p>
<p>After exchanging greetings for a while, we said goodbye and left the Yansheng Duke Mansion. According to the locals: "The Kong family's land accounts for about three-quarters of Qufu County; although it is usually not subject to taxes, because the descendants of the Kong family do not care much about the industry, it is now difficult for many tenants to sort out the situation. Due to the same situation, the Yansheng Duke's finances are also very difficult. His entire property is not enough to supply the monthly expenses of the various department staff and the gardeners of the Confucius Temple and the Confucius Cemetery. People are worried: I don't know in which year the Kong family will have hope of prosperity (meaning to get rich)!"</p>
<h3 id="e206">Half an Hour at the Post Office <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Zhe</p>
<p>It was just after the first day of the month, and at 1:40 in the afternoon, I strolled into the Jing'an Temple Road Post Office.</p>
<p>As soon as I pushed open the heavy glass door, I heard a roaring sound and saw that the counter was crowded with people. I had just taken a spot when a pile of human flesh pressed against me from behind. What's the matter, why are so many people here today waiting to remit money?</p>
<p>To my right, two women were mumbling. One of them, with a face full of wrinkles, temples streaked with white, and a mouth like a sunken hole, had greasy white eye secretions stuck to the corners of her eyes. She pursed her lips and talked seriously to the other younger woman next to her, both speaking with an Anhui accent.</p>
<p>I finished writing the remittance form and rested my elbows on the counter, looking at the two women. I paid attention to their clothes and guessed that they were both honest and good people from the countryside. I don't know why, but the old woman also noticed me next to her, and it seemed that she knew from my clothes that I was still literate. Suddenly, a humble smile appeared on her wrinkled face, and she tremblingly held out her remittance form to me, saying respectfully:</p>
<p>"Sir," she nodded and smiled. "Please—oh, sir, this letter, oh, did Lao Huang write it from ×× Town, Wuwei County, Anhui...? Sorry, sir!"</p>
<p>The Lao Huang she was talking about was probably a colleague of the master she was working for as a domestic helper, or maybe the master's chauffeur, or something else. Maybe she had just gotten her wages yesterday and was sending it all home today. She didn't use a penny; her family was probably longing for Shanghai by the sea, hoping to have money sent back. The countryside was bankrupt, and this old woman had probably rushed to Shanghai because the countryside was bankrupt—I thought shyly, so I took her remittance form and envelope and read them. There was nothing wrong with what was written on it, it was "×× Store, ×× Town, Wuwei County—" but the name of the province was not written. I thought that maybe writing the name of the province would be clearer, so I asked her:</p>
<p>"Is Wuwei County in Anhui?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes—" the old woman's face was full of respectful and humble smiles.</p>
<p>"Oh, then I'll add the words Anhui for you, it's not written Anhui above."</p>
<p>"Ah, did Lao Huang write it wrong? Ah ah, what's the matter, what's the matter, what should I do if it's wrong? Foreign money—" Her wrinkled face, which had lost its color, turned green in panic.</p>
<p>"It's not wrong, grandma, he's not wrong, Wuwei County is right, I said it would be clearer to add the word Anhui above." I smiled and immediately added the blue words "Anhui" at the top of the ink-written characters with a fountain pen. The onlookers burst into laughter.</p>
<p>She was grateful, tears welled up in her eyes, and she nodded, "Thank you, oh, sir, thank you, thank you."</p>
<p>She kept thanking me, and I was a little embarrassed. I didn't know why she was so grateful to me, I didn't give her any great favor.</p>
<p>People continued to come in from outside the glass window. Some just bought a few cents of stamps and left, and some went to the parcel counter to pack. Only the remittance counter was still crowded with people. According to the post office regulations, remittances would not begin until two o'clock, and there were still twenty minutes left. But it was already crowded at this time. The old woman muttered, and the gray wool hat was lying on the counter to write the money order. The blue-eyed foreign woman was speaking "Pidgin English" with the postal worker selling stamps.</p>
<p>The old woman showed the remittance form to the businessman-like person next to her again, and the old woman said:</p>
<p>"The kind sir just added it for me," she pointed to the blue words. "Sir, is this how it's written? Lao Huang is really confused, sir!"</p>
<p>The melon-skinned hat nodded a little, "That's right!"</p>
<p>So the old woman turned towards me again: "Sir, kind sir, thank you so much. Heh heh, sir, I still have a two-year-old grandson at home, you know, I wouldn't have bothered to come to Shanghai to work if I didn't have to, but, sir, sir, the mother of Xiao Sanzi, sir, my daughter-in-law, is strong and healthy, but she has to stay at home to take care of the children!"</p>
<p>She babbled on, telling her story, and I listened quietly to her story. My smile turned to seriousness, and a scene of a desolate countryside unfolded before my eyes. Those people were running around for a living, and I admired this old woman's "interest in life," and I grieved for the fate of this thin and frail old woman!</p>
<p>It was two o'clock, and the old woman handed two snow-white silver dollars to the postal worker, who dropped them into the drawer with a clang. The old woman took the slip of paper, stuffed it into an envelope, and walked out of the crowd with a happy face.</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir, oh, thank you, thank you!"</p>
<p>She thanked me like this again, and I couldn't think of anything to say to her, and I was very awkward. I also finished the remittance procedures and left the counter. It was 2:10 at this time. In half an hour at the post office, I took a course in sociology and a course in the philosophy of life.</p>
<p>Walking out of the heavy door, I saw the smiles floating on the bitter faces of those in a corner of a village in Anhui. I also saw my mother's smiling face, and I also saw countless countless starving eyes in the countryside looking up at the money flying to the seaside, but most of them were still recovering from disappointment with ugly bitter faces.</p>
<p>A string of tragic human heads rolling. My head was dizzy.</p>

<p>— From Mu</p>
<p>In 1914, there was a total solar eclipse near the German-Russian border that could be observed. At this time, Einstein hoped that his theory would be proven, but this year, due to the outbreak of the war, the German observation team became prisoners of Russia, and Einstein's opportunity was lost. The experiment at the Ritzke Observatory in 1918 also ended in failure. The British astronomer Eddington was a researcher of relativity. In 1917, he published his explanation; in March of the same year, at the proposal of the British Astroma and Royal, because of the total solar eclipse observation in May 1919, preparations were made at the joint meeting of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society, taking into account the results of the climate, it was decided to send observation teams to two places on the total solar eclipse line. Eddington participated in the African team. On the day of the solar eclipse, the African side was sunny, so they took several photos, which showed the existence of the Einstein effect. Another team also encountered sunny weather, and the results of the photography of the large and small telescopes there were credible on the small side, but also clearly verified the Einstein effect. The report at the joint meeting of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society in London on November 6, 1919, showed that Einstein's law was more proven than Newton's. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening Passage "Ancient Tang"</p>
<p>There are myriad joyful things in the world, but the taste of romance is the sweetest. I advise people to indulge in prostitution, only to find themselves spending their fortunes in front of everyone. These pleasure-seeking libertines only need to sleep in a brothel once to feel like living immortals, as the saying goes. Where is the zither of Liu Xiahui after his death? The virtuous man has not been seen receiving incense. The ancients said that beauty is loved by everyone, and the immortal Lü Zu teased the peony three times. He has an immaculate heart of eighty-nine mysterious arts. The oil vendor runs a small business, grinding the mill with his feet and shoulders, exclusively favoring the courtesan, even paying extra. Zheng Yuanhe squandered his gold and silver and sold himself to Laixing, achieving the top scholar position through diligent study, but ultimately indebted to Li Yaxian. Do not regard gold and silver as precious as life. Tao Zhu's death leaves only empty fists. Only paper ashes are received before the spirit. Stealing half a day of leisure in fleeting life costs only a little flower powder money. The ancients said that romance is vast and boundless.</p>

<p>Opening Passage "West Lake Scene"</p>
<p>The West Lake scenery is truly extraordinary. The flowers on both banks are all unique. Let us all enjoy the road to Gushan together. The road out of Gushan leads to Bai Causeway. West of the causeway, Lingyin Temple and Yun Guang are remarkable. The carved beams and red lacquered doors of the temple face the high peaks of the South. From there, one can see the waters of the Qiantang River flying. Boats cross the three or five six bridges. After crossing the six bridges, the road is not lost. The most enchanting are the willows of Su Causeway, green willows and red peaches separated by bamboo fences. Next to the fence, one goes straight up Phoenix Ridge. At the ridge, there is Qingquan Creek with nine streams. The most famous on the creek is the Eighteen Creeks. The water flows strangely in the creeks, regardless of high or low steps. One walks towards Yue Fei's tomb with a heavy heart, feeling a sudden burst of anger, cursing the treacherous minister Qin Hui's wife. When the wife is not virtuous, the husband suffers misfortune. Misfortune arises unexpectedly and is difficult to escape. Leaving the body, one proceeds forward, reaching the lakeside and gazing around. One sees the wonderful scenery of the outer lake, the enchanting Three Pools Mirroring the Moon on the islet. On the islet, green moss is in the colors of spring. The beauties of the inner lake have fairylike faces. They slowly move along the Jade Belt Bridge. Shadows of flowers move as the setting sun shines, illuminating the seven-tiered pagoda of Leifeng. After climbing to the top, one looks far and sees the distant City God Temple and Tianzhu scenery vaguely. The scattered desolate village is in the setting sun.</p>

<p>The way to remonstrate is not to make the ruler fear our words, but to make the ruler believe our words. To make the ruler believe our words, it is better to make the ruler enjoy our words. To warn with disaster is to make the ruler fear. To explain with reason is to make the ruler believe. To awaken with the heart is to make the ruler enjoy. Raising the chaos of the Tianbao era could not stop Emperor Jingzong's trip to Lishan. Raising the siege of the capital could not alleviate Emperor Xianzong's infatuation with the Buddha's bones. Was it not because they only warned with disaster and never explained with reason? Discussing the principles of court assemblies could not stop Duke Zhuang from watching the community sacrifice. Discussing the essence of pitch pipes and musical scales could not stop King Jing from casting bells. Was it not because they only explained with reason and never awakened with the heart? Disaster can indeed make people fear, but when encountering arrogance, our arguments are exhausted. Reason can indeed make people believe, but when encountering confusion and disbelief, our arguments are exhausted.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Mourning Ms. Ruan Lingyu <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>We cannot but mourn Ms. Ruan Lingyu with the greatest grief, on this day of the March 8th International Women's Day of 1935, the one-year anniversary of Ai Xia's death, when we received the news of her death.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that Ms. Ruan Lingyu's death is not only a loss to her personally, nor to her family or a certain group of people who knew her, but a loss to the entire Chinese film industry. This is because she was a talented actress. From her first work at Lianhua Company, which was also the work that made her known to people, "Spring Dream in the Old Capital," to "Wild Grass Blossoms," "Love and Duty," "A Cut Plum Blossom," "The Plum Blossom's Tears of Blood," "Yu Tang Chun," "Sequel to Spring Dream in the Old Capital," "Three Modern Women," "Night in the City," "Little Toys," "Coming Home," "Life," "The Goddess," all the way to her last work, "New Woman" (and "National Customs" which was not finished), in terms of her acting skills, it can be said that there was not a single one that did not demonstrate her excellent acting skills. Of course, we do not want to review each of her works now, but generally speaking, she left behind many achievements for Chinese cinema. Especially in "Three Modern Women," which was the first Chinese film to enter a new stage, she played a role that she had no life experience in, and in "Night in the City," "The Goddess," and "New Woman," she demonstrated her unique talent. But now she is dead, and we can no longer see her new works. This talented actress with a great future! We cannot but lament the loss to Chinese cinema!</p>
<p>Because of her suicide, people will not forget that in "New Woman" she played the role of a woman from a small propertied class who committed suicide due to the contradiction between life and will, and the suffering given to her by society, thus cursing the "revelation" of suicide in "New Woman," which has bad incitement for her and for the whole society. At the same time, on the other hand, people will not ignore the lawsuits about damaging her reputation that have been published in various newspapers in recent days. But after we delve into "New Woman" for observation, "New Woman" is by no means an inspiration for women to commit suicide. On the contrary, the playwright is against suicide; this is revealed by the playwright's intention through the mouth of the female worker A Ying. Opposing suicide as the theme of the play is precisely one point of the playwright's success. At the same time, according to the reporter's investigation, Ruan Lingyu bought more than half a dozen sleeping pills long before the lawsuit occurred. At that time, the people of Lianhua Second Factory had notified Ms. Ruan's mother to keep a close watch, which is enough to prove that her suicide motive was definitely not recent. So why did Ruan Lingyu commit suicide? Was it the instigation of "New Woman"? Was it the reputational relationship of the divorce case? In addition to these two, is there the common economic relationship of suicide? From the point of view that she had a very high monthly income, it is of course impossible to be a reason.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Chinese women in the current stage can feel great pain everywhere, making it possible for them to die tragically. Especially small propertied women, just as "New Woman" says, they struggle painfully in the contradiction between life and will every day. And more conscious women such as Ruan Lingyu, they want to climb up because of the temptation of material things, but in fact they are not allowed to do so easily. At the same time, they want to actively merge with the masses of production and embark on the road of resistance, but they know that they cannot stand that kind of cruel torment in life. They need spiritual improvement, but at the same time they also need life improvement, so this internal conflict and contradiction cannot be resolved, and suicide to destroy oneself in the contradiction is by no means an accidental result. Furthermore, many women regard marrying as a "destination," but after they marry, they cannot get sincere love and comfort, but only material anesthesia. As for Ms. Ruan personally, due to the records in the newspapers, she could not but suffer unbearable pain and stimulation, so although this was not her motive for suicide, it was also one of the main reasons for her suicide. In this way, Ms. Ruan is a courageous conscientious objector. For the seriousness of her own life, for the respect of her personality, for the disillusionment of spiritual improvement, and for the desire to get rid of pain and boredom, her suicide is a courageous expression for herself.</p>
<p>Yes, her suicide and Ms. Ai Xia's suicide are the expression of the distress of Chinese small propertied women. They are all conscientious and brave martyrs, but are suicides warriors? On the contrary, with the courage to commit suicide, what else is impossible to do? We firmly oppose suicide. We believe that the murderers of Ruan Lingyu are not certain individuals, let alone the instigation of "New Woman," but the real culprit is the evil society. Then, not being able to resist the evil forces of society, but becoming a victim of society, is a sign of weakness. Then, since she could not die for a noble cause, even if she knew after death, as "New Woman" says, she would regret it very much. At the same time, how weak is the significance of March 8th for Chinese women! Oh! This evil present society, may thousands of heroines transform the determination to commit suicide into revolutionary action for the common way out for oppressed women, and bravely avenge the sisters who have died! Because Ms. Ruan Lingyu died on March 8th, the reporter cannot but shout so boldly.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Review of "Racing Smiles" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Jihan</p>
<p>6 Day Bike Rider Great Light</p>
<p>Not joking: because there are currently several new soft gentlemen who are emphasizing the artistic value of movies, that is, when they are demanding that movies appear completely as entertainment, if their theory can exist, I almost want to recommend the author of "Racing Smiles" as their standard mentor.</p>
<p>Isn't it? In this film, all there is are gimmicks, gimmicks, and the third is still gimmicks. Joe Brown's big mouth is so big that just this big mouth is enough to make you laugh. He used to ride a bicycle, riding very cleverly, like watching a bicycle performance in the Great World, which is enough to surprise people. And he can take off his clothes, take off his pants on the bike, the bike runs over banana peels, falls, and this makes the soft gentlemen crack their big mouths and laugh, like Joe Brown's. In short, this film can make people laugh, no matter how reluctant and stiff these gimmicks are, but the audience is laughing in the theater for a while. Then this is entertainment, this is the unprincipled artistic value required by the soft gentlemen.</p>
<p>But ah, if artistic value is only explained in this way, if the so-called artistic pleasure is just the stacking of stiff skills without content, then the art of film should really be destroyed from now on.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that without content, there is no form, and there is absolutely no artistic value based solely on skills. So what is the content of "Racing Smiles"? A young man, no matter how clumsy he is, as long as he is brave, he can always win the favor of a beauty. And that beauty is the daughter of a banker, of course, the son-in-law's fortune is not a problem. So in the end we see the young man walking happily with his lovely wife and children.</p>
<p>I think there is no need to explain it any further, it is so vulgar and empty, what else can we say? But the soft gentlemen say that content is secondary, and only ask for so-called pleasure. But the pleasure here will not leave any deep impression in the audience's memory, right?</p>
<h3 id="e216">Several Comedians on the Silver Screen <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Guangyi</p>
<p>Comedians are welcomed all over the world. Their art has no borders and is understood by everyone. Here I tell you the little history of several comedians you often see:</p>
<p>Laurel and Hardy - This pair of comedians are the most popular in recent years. They are an old partnership, and they have both feature films and short films, but most of them are short films. Laurel is British, born in 1895. He started acting on stage with his parents at the age of seven. He went to the United States at the age of sixteen and entered the Hollywood film industry at the age of twenty-three. Hardy is American, born in 1892, three years older than Laurel. Don't look down on him, he is actually a graduate of the Faculty of Law at the University of Georgia! He has had a special love for movies since early on, although he did not enter the film industry until he was twenty-two years old. The cooperation between Laurel and Hardy began with silent films. The films they co-star in now are all sound films, which are all laughable. Their recent work, "Toy World," has already been performed in Shanghai last month.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin - This is a well-known and most popular veteran comedian. He was born in London in 1889. His father was British and his mother was a dancer born in Spain. He lived in extreme poverty in his childhood. He served in the opera troupe at the age of eight. In 1906, he went to the United States with a British troupe. In 1913, he was promoted by the famous director Mack Sendett and entered the film industry. In the spring of 1931, he traveled to Europe. The French government specially awarded him an honorary military band. It is said that he will make a sound film after "City Lights."</p>
<p>Rock - Born in 1892 in Nebraska, USA, he was a famous comedian in his early years, but he has had very few works recently because he is already a wealthy millionaire. He apologized to our people for the anti-Chinese film "Fearless" he starred in, stating that it was a misunderstanding, and said that he admired Chinese cultural relics very much.</p>
<p>Pierce Caden - Born in Kansas, USA, he is famous for his facial expressions. Pierce's wife was originally a cousin of Noma Talmadge, but they later divorced due to discord, and married Ms. Mei, a nurse he met in the hospital while he was ill.</p>
<p>Will Rogers - A senior veteran in the film industry, born in 1879. After more than ten years of stage experience, he stepped into the film industry. He is not only a comedian, but also a writer and political commentator! He is currently the honorary mayor of Hollywood. He can get 125,000 gold yuan for each film he shoots. He has been to Shanghai and is an interesting typical American.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Ruan Lingyu's Spirit of Sacrifice is Unbearable to Recall <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Although an artist's success requires talent, it also requires hard work and the courage to sacrifice the boundless hope of treasure. Like Ruan Lingyu, she was not only sincere and loyal to her work, but also did everything she could for the sacrifices that art required of her. During the filming of "New Woman," there was a scene where she had to roll down the staircase from the second floor. Director Cai intended to perform the scene with a long shot, and find someone with a similar figure to replace her falling. However, Ruan Lingyu thought that this would inevitably reduce the power of the drama. If the director agreed, she was willing to fall down the building herself to change the long shot to a medium shot. Of course, this was an unexpected gain that the director could not ask for. The result: it was so satisfactory, but Ruan's knees were broken.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Imperial Aunt Hu Shan Returns to the Silver Screen <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Movie Queen Hu Die's beloved sister Hu Shan has not appeared on the silver screen for a long time. Those who do not know think that Hu Shan has left the silver screen life. In fact, Hu Shan is still determined to make progress in film art. It is said that Jixing Company's new film "Fang Yunying" is starred by Hu Shan. This drama depicts the life of artists, delicate and refined, artists strive for art and can not be tempted by profit and not be succumbed by power. Hu Shan plays the artist Fang Yunying, with expressions such as drama in the drama. The entire film has sound dialogues and singing. Photography and sound are handled by expert Johnson. The test screening was held at the company's studio yesterday, and the results were very perfect. It is said that it will be released at the Jincheng Grand Theater soon.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3 id="e219">Anecdotes of Wellington (The Iron Duke) (4) <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Louis, hearing this, finally sat down reassured and said, "Let's do it that way. Let's go to Ghent..." The Duchess, hearing this, immediately tried to stop him, but he kept grumbling, "Ugh... filthy hotels... we must stay... tasteless food... we must eat... dust... mud..." The Duchess, helpless, turned to the General in Southern Garb and said, "Capture him alive and hand him over to me." The General in Southern Garb bowed and said, "Certainly. Bring him back in an iron cage."</p>
<p>The General in Southern Garb led four thousand elite soldiers to meet Napoleon, but he did not capture Napoleon alive. Instead, Napoleon captured him alive. After being captured by Napoleon, the General in Southern Garb prostrated himself at the feet of his former master, offering him his life, his soldiers—everything. The soldiers' sense of obedience surpassed everything else. Before the General in Southern Garb left Paris, he was still a loyal subject of Louis XVIII, but Napoleon was his former master. The General in Southern Garb's example was followed by everyone in France. The entire country of France surrendered to Napoleon. In less than two weeks, Napoleon had entered Paris and once again became the Emperor of France.</p>
<p>At the headquarters in Brussels, the Duke of Wellington hastily reassembled the allied forces, already numbering over one thousand. At this time, Louis and his niece were living in Ghent, and his niece led the royal bodyguard to attack Paris every day. Wellington, hearing this news, rushed to Ghent overnight to see King Louis, telling him not to act rashly and informing him that Napoleon was currently at the height of his power and that even the allied forces were holding back, waiting for a good opportunity.</p>
<p>Wellington went to Ghent more than once, but every time he went to see Louis, the Duchess of Anorliet was always by his side, and she made no secret of her hostility towards Wellington.</p>
<p>A month, two months, three months passed in this way, and all of Europe was in a state of panic. The god of war descended upon the sky again, leering at the dead and wounded strewn across the battlefield, while funeral songs rose from all directions, echoed throughout the mountains and valleys. Napoleon's army set out, launching a swift and decisive attack on the allied forces, aiming to drive them out of French territory.</p>
<p>In the Brussels mansion of the Duchess of Richmond, the young and beautiful Duchess Frances Webster was helping the Duchess send out invitations. The Duchess was holding a dance party soon, and the Duchess was folding the invitations and putting them into envelopes for her. But her hands trembled, and nine times out of ten she couldn't get them in. The Duchess looked at her and said, "Frances, you're being more of a hindrance than a help. Just leave it to me." The Duchess sighed, "Charlotte, you can't blame me. Isn't he coming soon?"</p>
<p>The Duchess spat at her and said, "Tsk, you silly girl. The Duke of Wellington is coming to dinner. Why would he come so early?" The Duchess said, "Oh, I adore him..." The Duchess said, "But you've never even seen him." The Duchess said, "I have a portrait of him in my bedroom. His eyes—so handsome and lovely!" The Duchess asked, "Does your husband also think his eyes are handsome and lovely?" The Duchess said, "He's still in Constantinople." The Duchess said, "Is he going to be there forever?" The Duchess sighed again and said, "Charlotte, I beg you for one thing. When the Duke of Wellington arrives—please don't leave my side—or I might faint."</p>
<p>The Duchess was about to reply when suddenly there was a commotion upstairs, and the chandeliers above their heads shook. The Duchess couldn't help but cry out, "Oh no! I bet Wellington has arrived. He's playing with the children upstairs." As she said this, she immediately stood up and ran upstairs.</p>
<p>The noisy sounds in the room grew even louder. When the Duchess opened the door and entered, everyone was crawling on the floor. Besides the children, the Duke of Wellington, the one who had become the Iron Duke, was also crawling on the floor. The Duchess couldn't help but laugh and say, "If Bonaparte saw you like this, it wouldn't be bad." Wellington stood up and grinned, "That would be great. At least it might help him understand some sense of humor." (To be continued)</p>
