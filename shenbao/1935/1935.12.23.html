<h3 id="c22">英美關係之新趨勢 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>自華北間題嚴重化海軍會議開幕後英美二國關係顯有更新之趨向本月五日英國外務大臣與美國國務卿曾同時發表聲明一則表示對華北問題之關心認干涉中國內政爲不幸一則表示列强於中國問題有集體的義務對於九國公的務必嚴格遵守海軍會議席上英國對於其一向主張之中型兵艦主義竟示讓步而接受美國之大型主義願以三萬二千噸爲最大限度此項問題本爲英美二國對於海軍問題爭執之中心英國甘於讓步想亦必有其用意而近者英國上院某議員竟有英美二國訂結海軍防守條的之建議此議雖屬理想然亦可知英國一般意見之所趨矣</p>
<p>根據此項理想則英國應將其重耍海軍港如新嘉坡等處爲美國開放使美國艦隊得使用英國軍港美國對英亦開放美國軍港船塢及燃料站等如此則可以防止任何國家在海洋中實行侵略此理想之依據爲英法最近所訂之恊定卽法國允許於英國艦隊被攻之時英艦得使用法國軍港顧此議如適用於遠柬一隅或有實現之可能性如普通適用則非事實之所許遠東方而英美之利害一致英國缺乏艦隊而美國缺乏軍港論者謂一旦美國有事遠東使英國不許其借用香港則美國艦隊之力量必大爲减低海軍港之互相開放乃所以增强制止侵略之力量而使太平洋西岸得適當之警衛也</p>
<p>雖然英美合作已具體化至何程度吾人不得而知在談判此種軍事上合作方法之先尚有許多政治上問題亟待解决蓋遠東局面至於今日英國無單獨抗日之能力又無與日妥協之可能唯有聯美國以自禦事甚明顯美國欲維護其門戶開放政策及保持非列賓羣島之安全亦需要英國之助力然美國爲民主國家總統無訂立秘密條約之權而總統之答應又往往遭國會之否决英欲恃美國爲己助事實上殊多困難蓋國務院之保證並不完全可靠也且現時中立法案仍阻止總統與任何國家訂立軍事上同盟此美國方而之障礙也英國對於遠東素採實利主義聯日聯美每唯便利是視九一八以後西門之不接受史汀生之建議已使美國主張合作者寒心苟此種態度不變美國亦不願合作此英國方面之隙礙也雖然英美二國在遠東已達分則兩敗合則兩利之境想兩國之政治家必能努力打破此種障礙而積極合作也</p>

<p>— 羅淸生</p>
<p>犬瘋在我國已有二千年之歷史，左襄十七年（566B.C）巳有國人逐瘈犬之記載，所謂瘈犬，卽今之瘋犬也。</p>
<p>此病在我國流行甚廣，幾無地無之，野犬聚集之處，更爲傳播此病之媒介，犬染病之後，遇人噬咬，苟不迅速醫治，卽有性命之危，除人之外，其他家畜如猪馬牛羊貓以至家禽，俱有傳染之可能。</p>
<p>犬瘋病原，現尙未有人能分離培養，卽多數學者所承認之病原內基氏體（Negri　bodies），亦不能定斷爲何物。病之潛伏期長短不一，平均如下表：</p>
<p>若傷口深陷，病毒量多，而毒力强，且距離中央神經系近者，則潛伏期較短，反是則長，家畜爲瘋犬所咬而致病者，不過佔百分之二十至三十。</p>
<p>人有犬瘋病，百分之九十由病犬傳染，其餘則由貓狼及其他牲畜。人爲瘋犬咬後，死亡率的在百分之十六至二十。據Babes氏若爲瘋狼所傷，則死亡達百分之六十至九十。</p>
<p>犬爲傳染此病之重要媒介，而犬爲人之伴侶，已有數千年之歷史，降至今日，通都大邑，以至窮村僻野，犬與人雜處，苟對斯病無明瞭之認識，危險特甚，故將犬瘋徵狀，詳述於下：</p>
<p>先兆期　病犬沮喪，易受刺激，喜藏黑暗之處，不喜與人接近，亦有見熟人呈親熱狀態，而對於外人則作咬噬之狀，食慾起變化，嗜不消化物質，如泥土乾草木片碎石等，傷口奇癢，常以舌舐之或以齒嚙之，間亦有如常者，大小便之排泄，常感困難。</p>
<p>刺激期　病犬不安靜，性情忽變兇惡，對於動物或椅桌痰盂等，作無目的之衝擊。喜離家遠遊，毫不呈疲倦之狀，途遇他犬或牛馬羊猪，則奮力咬鬥，不作一聲，對人常存畏懼之心，但受刺激或恐嚇，則入亦在攻擊之列，在此時期常有神經麻痺之徵狀，最重要者爲聲音之改變，音粗響而長，異於常犬，有經騐之入聞之，卽知其染有犬瘋病，除此之外，食慾消失，飲水亦感困難。</p>
<p>麻痺期　在此時期麻痺狀態更顯，口常張開，舌下垂，唾涎流出口外，上瞼下垂，斜視，角膜暗加無光，瞳人放大，四肢麻痺初發現於後腿，行走不穩，不久後部完全麻痺，臥倒地下，麻痺進展甚速，而至體之前部，此時病犬極爲消瘦，衰竭，不久卽死，死前常有驚厥。貓染此病，其徵候與犬同。</p>
<p>病期普通爲四至七天，短者三日，亦有延長至二三星期者，犬瘋爲不治之症，自愈者極罕，瘋犬咬人後，卽宜設法將該犬捕捉或擊斃，（不可將腦全部毀壞，因檢查內基氏體，多取材於腦之海馬體），送至醫院或衛生機關，以便檢查是否爲犬瘋，若診斷確實，被咬者卽宜施行巴司德療治法，苟無治療設備，則傷口多放血，並用消毒藥水，如純酒精，百分之三石炭酸，百分之一昇汞等冲洗，俾將病毒消滅於無形，總之瘋犬咬後，愈早醫治愈有希望，數小時或數日之後，則毫無把握，待病狀發現，則挽救乏術矣，至於報紙上偶載醫治犬瘋奇方或秘方，細閱之下，令人失笑，旣不符科學原理，又無實騐之證明，誤人不淺。</p>
<p>現今外國都市，對於犬瘋一病，防之惟恐不周，皆訂有嚴厲章程，取締野犬及畜犬之家，反觀我國城市之區，野狗遍地，瘋犬咬人，時有所聞，人命損失，雖無確實統計，然以人口之衆，野狗之多，恐非少數也。</p>
<p>犬瘋預防菌苗，經各國學者數十年之研究，已有相當成效，我國北平中央防疫處，亦有犬瘋菌苗製造，每七公撮售價二元，足可注射一犬之用，免疫期的一年。</p>

<p>— 紀元</p>
<p>成渝渝道上雜寫</p>
<p>十月十五日晨、記者冒雨乘公路局長途公共汽車自重慶出發赴成都、同行者有袁君文彬、事前爲了搭乘汽車問題、頗費躊躇、成渝公路、雖有公路局之設立、對於車輛之管理、似欠週密、公路局之「特別快車」、旣無固定之班期、而私人營業之汽車公司以及野鷄汽車、各自兜攬乘客、車價旣無一定、又少十分安全的保障、加以成渝道東段、因秋雨連綿、道路泥濘、覆車之警訊頻傳、使我們無形中加上一層憂慮、最後終於鼓起勇氣、搭公路局的公共汽車西進、</p>
<p>是日、我們侵晨卽到通圓門外汽　車站入候車、抵站時、前幾排坐位、已被人佔滿、而乘客到站者、則仍寥寥無幾、記者問其原因、答稱、此係某參謀長太太預定的座位、太太等一回就要來的、」後經折衝結果、終算於前排讓出了一個位子、</p>
<p>車原定七時卽開、可是到了正式開時、已敲過九點、超過預定時間已達二小時餘、後經探悉、四川各交通機關、各團體聚集及宴會、往往多不遵守時間、譬如宴客、原定時間爲上午九時或下午三四時、但客人到時、總要遲半個點頭以上、據云、此乃表示客人地位的尊崇、非一呼卽至之流可比、此風迄今未變、川人生活習慣之守舊、於此可見、</p>
<p>車出重慶城時、照例須經過嚴密的檢查、翻箱倒篋、旅客叫苦不絕、可是檢查處之檢查員、對於「客」或「軍人」之行李、則不大加以檢查、記者因有公路局之介紹信、亦稍免檢查之煩、慚愧慚愧、</p>
<p>由重慶西行約六十里、卽達老　岩山麓、車行至此、須盤旋登山而上、山上公路、全由人工開鑿而成、有幾處地方且須鑿山而過、工程設計甚爲浩大、而形勢亦甚雄壯、爲四川公路建設最偉大的一部份、車由山麓盤旋至山頂、的須經一小時許、及至山巓、則盤旋登山時所經之公路綫歷歷可見、風景之佳、難以描寫、惟山高地低、俯瞰時頗令人心悸耳、</p>
<p>老鷹岩山巔面積頗爲廣闊、車行至此、蜿蜓曲折、四圍林木蒼鬱、墟里三五、下山時、仍須盤旋而下、危險之狀、則較上山時爲甚、因轉灣之處、皆係削壁、雖有少數土堆、低墻及巨石置諸路旁、以資防禦、待司機者偶一不愼、仍有覆車之虞、過老鷹岩卽抵靑木關、平原頗廣闊、聞附扳有溫泉、與北溫泉同出一源、惜未被利用、十二時半車過璧山縣、其時細雨仍浙瀝不已、路上泥濘盈尺、幸駕駛奢幹練、得履險如夷、所經各地、但見阡陌縱橫、邱陵起伏、山巓路旁亦遍種農作物、田畦之整齊、農夫操作之勤勞、爲他省所罕見惜因四川農民二十年未受盡軍閥·官僚·豪紳·地主之剝削、飲泣吞聲、生活困苦不堪、所以類皆而有菜色、衣服襤褸、農村住宅、十之七八、皆用稻草泥牆建築而成、問有磚牆瓦蓋之房屋、亦多半係三四十年前之建築、已有傾圯之象、農村經濟之凋疲、於此可見一斑、是晚因道路泥濘、車行甚緩、宿於榮昌麟春旅館、一夜幾全被臭蟲蚊子所困、</p>
<p>榮昌隆昌等縣、爲四川有名出產夏布之地、品質優良、數年以前、行銷於省內各縣及黔·滇·陝·鄂·等省、爲數頗多、近年以來、因農村購買力大形减退、而且外貨充斥、榮昌夏布銷路遂一蹶不振、營是業者、深有難以維持之勢、於是不得不跌價兜攬生意、每尺價錢僅達一角有奇、而各夏布店門口、依然門可羅雀、幸各商店開支皆不甚大、故關門奢甚少、</p>
<p>次日侵晨、我們由榮昌向隆昌出發、同車某軍參謀長太太有阿芙蓉癖、每到車停時間較久地點、必須尋覓售「川藥」處、吞雲吐霧、約一二小時始珊珊而來、躭誤行程時間不少、同車者殊感不快、過了隆昌以後、兩旁農作物、又成另一景象、平地高原、多半栽種甘蔗、爲四川著名之內江產糖區域、聞內江甘蔗可分紅白二種、而白甘蔗又分蘆毛甘及羅漢甘二種、種蔗農人、多屬貧苦、佃耕土地、每萬斤蔗士、年納租金五元至九元、借欵大半以甘蔗作抵、每萬斤蔗可抵借二三十元、將來以蔗價償還、利息自月息二分五釐至四五分不等、如所付甘蔗不足償淸、則來年之甘蔗、糖房有先收之優先權、</p>
<p>近年以來、糖業銷路不暢、四川桔糖出口、在二十一年度曾達二千七百萬斤、至二十三年已减少三分之二以上、內銷聞亦减少二分之一、其裏落原因、則爲（甲）運費太大、捐稅負祖過重、（乙）易損壞而不潔凈、（丙）不能與外糖相競爭、改進方法、似應從改良製法、减輕捐稅運費、與推廣銷路入手、</p>
<p>內江爲一帶有古風而幽雅之城市、街道頗整潔、兩旁遍植楊柳、與重慶相較、另有一種風味、民情淳厚、市塲交易、甚少叫囂凌亂氣象、房屋建築甚低、頗似北平、蓋已帶有成都之風光矣、此地離重慶五百里、而離成都則爲五百零八十里、可謂成渝道上之中點、亦爲成渝路所經各縣、商業最盛、人口最多、旅館飯店等設施較完備的地點、</p>
<p>在內江逗留二小時、車卽繼續而進、同行袁君、因不慣顚簸、已甚疲倦、過內江後、路漸乾燥、問諸當地農民、知內江以西一帶、已數日不下雨、氣候亦較凉爽而舒適、不若重慶之終日籠罩於迷霧細雨之中、下午三時過資中、該地亦以產糖著名、五時過資陽、是時已暮色蒼茫、因須趕至簡州投宿、車仍繼續前進、四川一般肩挑夫、多係日夜工作、故雖在深夜、路上來往肩挑者、仍絡釋不絕、若輩大都以肩販爲生、肩運貨物、以本地之粗製品及農產品爲最多、他如香烟等等亦復不少、八時許、車抵簡州、宿鄰龍賓旅館、該處離成都僅百八十里、</p>
<p>從簡州至成都、須經石經寺、我等在石經寺忽忽游覽一周後、卽上車、自後車漸上坡、過龍泉驛、山不甚高、而曲折頗多、車行其間、蜿蜓而上、又蜿蜓而下、不若老鷹岩之成螺旋形、聞上山爲三十里、而下山亦三十里、迨至龍泉釋山頂、遠望城都城市、歷歷在目、遠望盤地平原、廣闊無垠、從重慶至龍泉驛山麓、一路丘陵起伏、至此則平原無際、如入另一境界、胸襟爲之一暢、</p>
<p>第三日上午十一時許、車抵成都、最先印入眼簾者、爲嵯峨高聳之新建碉堡、特殊醒目之勦匪標語、記者此决乘輸溯江而上、一入四川境界、卽見碉堡密佈、惟十之七八皆係用泥土建築、不甚堅固、工作亦簡陋、成渝道上亦多建有碉堡、以防匪患、成都城外所建之碉堡、全係用磚塊疊成、建築堅固、形式亦甚壯觀、但所化經費聞不少、聞袁君文彬云、在江西各大城市郊外、所築之碉樓、亦均較鄉間所築者雄壯云、</p>

<h3 id="c93">人體之構造淺說及其功用 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 中央大學敎授孫宗彭</p>
<p>人爲最高等動物，其構造至爲複雜，誠非短時間內所能詳述一切，今只就其大概言之，人體各部之構成，皆以微小之細胞爲單位，合多數之細胞而成組織，由組織而成器官，由器官而成系統，體內各系統，各器官，各有專責，借分工合作以行使日常生活，由構造言之，人體可分爲肌肉，骨骼，消化，循環，神經，生殖，排洩，呼吸，內分泌等諸大系統，茲將各系統之構造及其功用，分述於後。</p>
<p>（一）肌肉系統</p>
<p>肌肉之主要功用，司動作，及組成體內各部柔軟器官，就其形態言之，可分爲三種，　有紋肌——即組成身體外部軀殼者，附着於骨骼，以使各骨骼團結，而在神經指導之下，以行使有意識之動作，　平滑肌——用以組成內部各器官者，若腸胃血管等是也，此等器官，在尋常狀態之下，行使無意識之動作，如機器之開動不能自由靜止，　心肌——此種肌肉，形狀如有紋肌，而功用則如平滑肌，用以組成心臟，肌肉之內，滿佈微細之血管，以供給養料，尙有神經俾得接受外界之刺激。</p>
<p>（二）骨骼系統</p>
<p>骨骼可分爲軀幹，及叫肢二大部，軀幹又分爲頭頸胸背腰尾等，而四肢即手足是也，骨骼之功用，一爲支持全體之姿勢，一爲保護內部柔軟組織，如頭　骨之保護腦，脊椎骨之保護脊髓，胸肋背骨合成心腔，保護心肺各器官，腰脊椎支持體腔，以保護腸胃等器官，就質地言之，骨骼可分軟骨及硬骨二種，年幼時多骨較多，因其尙未鈣化也，鈣化之程度與年俱增，至年老時骨因鈣質（俗名石灰質）多而性脆，故老年斷骨則不易接。</p>
<p>（三）消化系統</p>
<p>自口至肛門之路徑曰消化道，包括口腔，咽喉，食道，胃小腸，大腸，直腸等，此外尙有附屬腺體如肝膵等是，於大小腸之連接處，有盲腸，本系統之主要功用爲消化食物以滋養身體，食物除維他命及無機鹽類外，大別之可分三類，　炭水化合物，即糖與澱粉織維等是，　蛋白質如動物肉質鷄蛋白等是，　脂肪即油質是也。</p>
<p>食物入口後，即由口內所分泌之唾液，消化一部分之炭水化合物而成糖，蓋唾液內含有消化炭水合物之酵素也，然後食物經咽喉及食道而入於胃，胃液內含有消化酵素，曰蛋白質酵素，脂肪酵素，及炭水化合物酵素，以消化三種食物，未消化之食物，又轉至小腸內，由腸液內及膵腺所分泌之酵素以消化之，肝之膽液於消化亦有力焉，巳消化之食物，爲腸壁所吸收而入於血液，藉血液之循環，以分佈於身體各部，不能消化之渣滓，由大腸及直腸經肛門，而排洩於體外，盲腸在人身體中，尙未瞪明有何功用，但在下等動物如兎，其盲腸內臟有微菌，確亦參加一部分之工作，因有一種微菌有發酵作甩，可使食物易於消化。</p>
<p>（四）循環系統</p>
<p>循環系統，包括血液之循環，及淋巴之循環，血液之循環系統有心臟動脈管靜脈管及脾臟，脾臟爲淋巴腺體對於紅血輪紅血素有密切之關係，心臟分爲左右心房左右心室，心室之壁較諸心房爲厚，心室之收縮動作，可生壓力，使血液流入動脈管，而分佈於全體，動脈管之管壁，較諸靜脈管爲厚，故可以抵抗較强之壓力，動脈管內血液流動之方向爲離心者，靜脈管則反是，其血管離心越遠者，分枝越細，血液之循環，即由左心室而入動脈管，分佈全身，然後由靜脈管而入右心房，轉入右心室，而輸入肺部，如是濁血藉呼吸作用更換氣體而使血液澄淸，再由肺部輸入左心房而入左心室，藉心臟收縮之動作，使血液冉入動脈管而循</p>
<p>血液含有微小之血細胞，該細胞大致可分爲紅白二種，紅血細胞含有紅血素故名，富有吸收養氣之特性，白血細胞普通較諸紅血細胞爲小，而形狀不一，富有抵抗或消滅毒菌等特性，此外尙有小血板血液除分佈營養物質及熱力外，尙有抗毒之特性，淋巴管沿着血管而行，管內有流動之淋巴液，爲乳白色，蓋含有營養物質之故也，淋巴實爲吸收營養物質之主要機關，血液中營養物質蓋由淋巴而得來者。</p>
<p>（五）神經系統</p>
<p>神經系統，爲唯一傳遞刺激及指揮全身動作之主要機關，就生理上言之，可分爲感覺神經，及動作神經二種，就部位上言之，可分爲中央神經，及邊緣神經，中央神經司分爲腦與脊髓二大部，中空而有液體，邊緣神經乃由腦部及脊髓所發出之神經分佈於身體四周，用以與外界接觸者，內有十二對腦神經，及多數之脊髓神經，由解剖上言之，中央神經之腦部，叉可分爲大腦，中腦，小腦，橋腦及延腦，人爲最高等動物，故大腦特別發達，因爲頭　骨所限，不能向外伸張，而向內增加面積，故上有多數之縐紋也，大腦又分爲二部，曰前腦與間腦，前腦司全身之感覺及隨意動作，了解，記憶，思維，聯念等高尙作用，第一對腦神經（嗅覺神經）由此部出，間腦在前腦之後，爲全身感覺刺激之總匯，亦司反射動作，第二對腦神經，（視覺神經）及第三對腦神經（眼肌肉神經）由此部出，中腦司視與聽，及身體之反射動作，第四對腦神經（眼肌肉神經）由此部出，小腦司全身肌肉動作，調養全身之平衡，及肌肉之調和，小腦之崁，有橋腦，司面部皮膚之感覺，頭部所有肌肉之感覺，味覺，及咀嚼之動作，與汗綫唾液錢之分泌等，最後爲延腦，司反射及調節之工作，此外則司內臟之動作，如呼吸，嘔吐，吞嚥等第五對至第十二對腦神經，由此出也，在延腦之後，爲脊髓，司軀幹及四肢接受外界刺激與反射動作，脊髓神經，即由此出，此外尙有交感神經，出由脊髓神經之神經結，而達臟腑，司平滑肌及心臟肌之動作，除以上所述之神經外，尙有感覺器官，以接受外界之剌激，由邊緣神經傳達至中央神經，今將各感覺器官略述於後。</p>
<p>視覺器官　眼司視覺，爲圓球狀，眼之前部外面，有透明之角膜，內爲前腔，含有透明之液體，腔之後面爲虹彩，中有孔曰瞳，水晶體即貼於瞳孔之後，在人體內，，該水晶體爲橢圓形，水晶體之後，為後腔，亦含有液體，光自外來透入角膜，經前後腔之液體及水晶體射於內部之網膜而得物影，其原理如攝影機然，故不難明瞭，網膜爲視神經所組成，此爲視覺最重要之部分，其中有辦別光與色之細胞，眼球除前部被以角膜外，其餘部分，外層爲軟骨性體曰鞏膜，內層爲網膜，界於鞏膜及網膜之間者，爲色紫層與脈絡膜是也。</p>
<p>聽覺器官　耳司聽覺，分耳殼外聽道中耳及內耳四部，中耳與外聽道之間，有鼓膜，鼓膜之後，有小骨三塊，聲浪擊着鼓膜，由此傳入耳中與口腔之間，由歐氏喇叭管所通，其與內耳相接處有二小孔，內耳之構造極爲複雜，有曲折之管道嵌於聽　骨中，管之內外皆有淋巴液，此管分爲司平衡之三半月形管，及具聽覺之蝸牛殼，有聽神經附着焉。</p>
<p>嗅覺器官　鼻司嗅覺，鼻腔之壁，滿佈嗅神經細胞，鼻腔與口腔通，故鼻亦司呼吸。</p>
<p>味覺官器　舌司味覺，其表面有多數之突起物，內藏味覺細胞，與味神經相連。</p>
<p>觸覺器官　皮膚司觸覺，故全身皆有此功用，但以手指為最靈敏，除觸覺外，兼司冷熱疼痛等。（未完）</p>

<p>各位先生今天短期小學敎育研究會開會、本人有幾句話簡單的向各位說說、國家的義務敎育如中國規定是六年、就應該受六年敎育、必不得已求其决亦應受四年的敎育、不過因國家經費的困難、及失學兒童者之衆多、若嚴格的照六年或四年制度來辦、恐政府一時籌費困難、日費時較長、使一般兒童都受到敎育、不知要待多少年、但國家患難犬天嚴重起來、要想把許多失學兒童在最短期開受到敎育、非縮短年限不可、故敎育部規定此臨時應急的辦法、並不是正軌的辦法、道是我們應首先認識淸楚的、不要以爲短期小學敎一年就算滿足、這是第一點、</p>
<p>第二點要說明白、一年制短期小學、要在很短的期間使失學兒童可以輪流受釗敎育、如以四年制的辦法、則在一個可容二百人的學校裹、四年之中祇能畢業二百人、而用短期小學制、則在同一學校中可每年敎二百人、雖不能作如此正確計算、但至少增加一倍是可以保證的、故敎部規定此辦法、可在最短期間使失學兒童輪流受到粗淺的敎育第三點、有人說短期小學年限太短、敎學材料太少、是不够應付需要的誠然、但此點我們不必顧慮的、一則有勝於無、受一年敎育雖短、但比不受敎育總要好、二則我們要使他們求進一步也是可能的、因他們年長以後、仍可入民衆學校補習學校或其他受社會敎育的機會、有了此一年的某礎、將來也可逐漸進步起來、故短期小學就是給他們一點工具、使他們將來有機會受進一步的敎育、</p>
<p>總之、短期小學是適應現在國家很窮困、而失學兒童父如此之多、故有此變通的辦法、那末短期小學旣如此需要、我們担任短期小學敎員的工作應如何做法呢、故各位今天大家來研究討論、解决困難、求敎學效能的進步、不過我可把個人的意思來向各位說說、</p>
<p>我以爲擔任此種職務實在國家對各位的矚望非不够、而事業又重要、才辦此短期小學、故各位就要在此原則之下來服務、儘管工作多報酬少、而不能分別敎員之高低也、可說各位對國家社會的服務精神比他們還要好、故希望大家盡力去做、服務的精神還是要飽滿、才是眞正為國家社會做工作、第二在短期小學敎授學生與普通小學不相同、普通小學規定年齡入學、頗爲整齊、程度亦相差甚少、而在短期小學就年齡參差、而稈度亦不整齊、把他們合在一班敎授、而且在一定期限內收得同樣的效果、其應用何種方法去敎學、就値得注意了、故短期小學敎育要特別提出研究、就是這個緣故、第三短期小學的敎員比較難做、如招收學生、就比普通小學困難、因事先敎局在各區調查出不能入普通小學的兒黨人數、於是在各區支配設立短期小學、短期小學的敎員就要收這批無力、或無時間入普通小學而失學的兒童才是眞正辦短期小學的意思、如把原在普通小學贖書的學生招來、那就不對了、這點大家應當注意、故做短期小學的敎員、非有業於國家社會兒童有熱心、肯犧牲的精神不可、要把敎員一半當職業、一半當事業、職業與事業是不同的、職業是櫗械的求物質的生活、而事業是精神的生活、各位要把職業與事業打成一片、認此工作不僅是求生活的職業、而是爲國家社會最尊貴的事業云云、</p>

<p>萬國盃足球賽中華對俄國、咋日下午三時交鋒於延平路申園、中華出席戰士、泰半係東華隊球員、俄軍則以蘇壳爾爲基本軍、故實際上彷彿爲東華戰蘇壳兩、中華本係上屆盟主、曾以十一對一之巨大比數、大勝俄軍、是以此次俄軍之敗、早在一般人意料中、昨日作壁上觀者約千餘人、上半時中華聯絡稍欠純熟、屢屢失機、將至終了時間、纔由曹秋亭攻入一球、下半時中華稍見活躍、以俄軍主將鮑羅庭犯規被判罰出、順勢攻入二球、總結果三比〇中華凱旋、茲將昨賽詳情分誌於後、</p>
<p>俄軍有勇無謀　三時正裁判員　脫銀笛聲起、俄軍先取攻勢、小賈邊陲進兵、陳倉暗渡、短遞與鐵腿、對敵門力射、矢如閃電、守門揮拳擊出、戴中軍迎之以頭、惜用力過猛、越門而過、此後我軍旁敲側擊、時在俄軍門前、興風作浪、敵右翼卡羅力區、滿塲馳逐、勇冠三軍、俄軍五鋒　其鼓起勇起、猖獗殊甚、惜有勇無謀、加以鵠的欠準、未被攻下城池、俄而孫錦順崛起中原、單騎直入、施其强硬之鐵腿、箭出如矢、竟被俄門波賽維區臥地撲出接住、殊爲可惜、俄軍父乘勢進逼、前鋒五將、捲地而至、銳不可當轉瞬已入我軍腹地、幸江善敬救駕有功、未遭毒手、</p>
<p>曹秋亭開紀錄　戴中軍坐鎭中央、暗中指揮、孫李兩將左右包抄、李義臣巧施調虎孫鐵腿舉脚力射、鮑羅庭乖巧萬分、暫兼守門職司、擋出來球、小賈趕之不及、望門與嘆而已、曹秋事邊陲再起、暗遞戴中軍、連下敵軍防地、躍起一脚、又被俄門趕出接住、敵軍勞別司脫夫特別賣力、單人匹騎、連闖三關、相機傳遞、幸阿匹殼夫趕之不上、祇逼成角球、如是者相持不下、的四十分鏟、俄而球由戴中軍在海浮洛夫脚底截下、　傳給李義臣輕輕一撥、曹秋事奔上、　然一脚、球由綱角而入、始開紀錄、上半時結束、中華以一球佔先、</p>
<p>三對零克俄國　檸檬過後、易地再戰、俄軍抱破釜沉舟决心、前鋒猖獗異常、因之球勢常在我軍陣地盤旋、幸脚頭歪曲、未能成功、戴麟經一馬常先、至離門—碼處、軋拉山刦球犯規、曹秋亭主罰、脚頭太軟、孫鐵腿動作略遲、又失去大好機會、俄軍粗魯性成、動作更趨野蠻、孫錦順與鮑羅庭爭奪來球、互相碰撞、鮑竟揮臂動武、幸法官判鮑離塲、賞罰公乎、俄軍旣失大將、益覺不支、乃改攻爲守、藉以鞏固後防、我軍趁勢進逼、戴麟經盤球前驅、左右傳遞、孫錦順近水樓臺、帶球深入、一脚踢去、被麥令諾司擋住、曹秋亭趕上力射、恰中紅心、孫鐵腿眼見敵防空閑、乘虛而人、果然又見奇功、三對零大局已定、此後各無建樹、直至鳴金收軍、陣綫如下、</p>

<h3 id="c197">美銀政策與英美貨幣戰 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 森禹</p>
<p>———夾板中的中國貨幣———</p>
<p>繼中國新貨幣政策之後，這幾天來世界金融市塲上又產生一件非常値得注目的大事；即日前倫數銀市因美國停購白銀之故銀價突然慘跌，市况極其不安，本月十日甚至被迫停板，造成一九一四年歐洲大戰以來所未有的第一次紊亂現象。目下美國雖仍在倫教購銀，使倫敦人心稍安，但畢竟因着出售的與收買的數額上相距仍多，市價依然續見下跌。</p>
<p>美國白銀政策之回顧及其因素</p>
<p>按美國白銀政策之最初表現者，爲一九三三年五月緊急農業救濟及通貨增發法第三部所謂湯姆斯修正條欵，該條欵授總統以變更銀元量目，自由鑄造及採用複本位制度之權，並得在二億元之限度內，用銀收受戰債本息（但結果祇收到英國之一千萬元）。其後續有一九三三年七日倫敦銀協定，至十二月協定批准，公布國內購銀法。一九三四年一月金準備法中所謂畢特門修正條欵，以及六月之購銀法，八月之銀國有令等。其中允以一九三四年六月購銀法（Silver　Purchase　Act）爲最重要，該法規定貨幣準備應達七五銀二五，即依此項比率爲目標，在國內外收購白銀；又授權財政部長發行銀票，並授權大總統於必要時得不問銀之所有者及所在如何，命令納入造幣局。</p>
<p>美國對於白銀這樣積極，一方面自然是基於國內產銀諸州的利益，及欲間接的促使通貨膨脹之故。然而祇看到國內原因，顯然不够說明。實際上所謂銀礦主的利益，在政策中並不見得最重要；計自一九三四年六月起，迄本年七月止，十三個月中政府所收買的白銀達四億七千二百萬盎斯，其中國內新產銀僅二千六百萬盎斯，其餘向民間收買的一億一千二百餘萬盎斯，大部份也是從海外輸入的。由此可知國內礦卞所獲利益，並不如所說的怎樣了不得。我們研究美國銀政策，應該進一步擴展到國際關係的上面去，但若只以單純的所謂「提高用銀國的購買力」來解說，那也仍舊不够：美國的計劃除了確想藉銀價之提高以增進南美及遠東各國的消費能力，俾發展其貿易外，並企圖控制上述各國之採用銀本位制及金滙兌本位制者，允其是中國的貨幣權，以冀擴大美元集團。總括的說，白銀政策也正是國際金融鬥爭的武器；而其與英國的衝突，則允屬　烈也。</p>
<p>復次，我們又不得不談到國際金銀複本位制問題。近來卞張採用複本位制度（Bimetalism）的聲浪頗高，而允以美國方面爲甚。美國人主張複本位制的動機，除亦有如一般的理論根據所謂補賞作用（Eqilibratory　Action）即平準作用（Eqilibratory　Action）者外，其主要又不能不說連　於銀的特殊關係；美國不僅自身手中，計美國的資本支配世界每年產銀總額的百分之六十以上。所以，把白銀恢復作爲貨幣用，根本解决它的出路，是再妥適也沒有的事。美國黃金已經很多，若同時再把銀增集起來，則全世界金銀的大部分，都操在手中，而能壟斷裕如；本國之外，可復强迫各國一致的實行金銀複本位制度，而在國際複木位制度名義之下，操縱國際金融。</p>
<p>以上為美國銀政策的主要目標，可列表如次：</p>
<p>銀政策的失敗及其新的動向</p>
<p>美國白銀政策的目的旣如上述，那末它的結果怎樣呢？無可吾認的，在國內除了銀礦主確有獲利者外，大多數人民依然得不到好處；在國際上，複木位制度實現尙屬渺茫；用銀國的購買力不僅未行提高，相反的却因更形加深了它們的恐慌程度，使購買力愈形縮小，而中國·墨西哥·秘魯·等，受害允烈·抑且由此給英國造機會，使其有利於擴大金鎊集團的活動。</p>
<p>基於以上種種失敗，美國對於它的銀政策自不得不重行加以相當考慮。然而辦法却很難，它已處於騎虎難下的形勢，照舊邁進，旣爲事實所不許；陡然放染，又非所願，抑亦不可能，所以最近幾月來美國迄在彷徨不安之中。</p>
<p>但至目前，形勢益形加緊，十一月初，中國又以金融恐慌的危急，被迫不得不改變幣制，而宜布了新的貨幣政策。此外，最近英國在國際金融市塲上的活動又非常積極，因使美國不得不採取必要的應付步驟。</p>
<p>美國的策略，終於在幾天以前出現了，這便是今决倫教銀市的變動。當變動突然發生，各方所傳原因紛紜龐雜，莫衷一是，有謂美國目的欲以低價收購白銀，以减輕其所支付的價額；有謂白銀傾銷數量過多，美國一時不能吸收；有謂最近歐洲現金不復大批運至美國，使美國不願高價多購白銀；有謂中國白銀大量密輸日本，美國不得不出而加以打擊等等。這些，的確都有相當關係，允以最後二項爲無可抹殺之事實。然而僅僅這些還不够說明，未能認爲銀變的主要因素，我們必須同時注意到英美貨幣戰爭新的階段之展開。（詳下述）</p>
<p>至於有人推測這是美國故棄白銀政策的先聲，但我覺得未必盡然，根據以下幾點，美國或不致就此放棄白銀的；　美國在國內外之銀鑛投資極巨，如將白銀問題放棄不理，爲事實所不可能。　美國政府在已往十餘個月中購銀甚多，如中途放棄白銀政策程序，試問這些存銀如何處置？　白銀在目前仍不失爲一國際金融戰爭的武器，美國欲制勝世界經濟舞臺，勢非仍利用之不可。　美國對於國際複本位制度的計畫並未中輟，而白銀爲複本位制的主角，如到白銀消極，則複本位制之實現更覺無望。</p>
<p>所以，我覺得美國對於白銀政策恐怕不會就此放棄，問題祇在於實施的方式如何而已。至於銀價，倘非絕對必要，也許不致無限度在跌下去，因據上述各點，銀價過跌，於美國本身亦利少弊多。根據最近事實，美國此後對於銀政策的方略，大的可作如下的推測：　把國際白銀市塲中心由倫敦移至紐的，以打擊英國，而使有美國更進一步的操縱世界之白銀：此點已由財政都長毛根韜口中說明。　向遠東等地直接購買白銀，俾將各該處的金融直接置於美國手中。　盡力使中國不離開白銀，並進一步把中國貨幣圈入美元集團。　以貨物易白銀，俾旣可不化黃金而直接獲得白銀，又可推銷過剩生產品，聞衆議員銀派積極分子台斯氏已有此種主張。</p>
<p>以上各點，其前途成敗如何，乃為另一問題；要之，大致為此後美國銀政策的動向。其中最表現顯明的，乃係針對英國的貨幣挑戰：而英美貨幣戰爭不啻為此决銀變的道火綫。此就美國財政部長毛根韜之談話以及銀派議員湯姆斯畢特門等之言論，可為極重要的明證。但這裏我們又不能不提及中國的貨幣問題，很不幸的，中國的貨幣現正為美元英鎊新鬥爭中的對象；最近幣制改革，無可諱言的，客觀中又加强了英美的對立，而展開今茲美元英鎊兩大集團之新的貨幣戰爭。</p>
<p>（三）美元集團與英鎊集團的對立</p>
<p>要暸解美元英鎊戰爭的現勢，須先明白它們集團的陣容，以及已往鬥爭的情形。</p>
<p>貨幣是金融資本主義時代爭奪市塲的武器；幣集團是經濟集團所發展的必然的產物，它的結合比一般經濟集團更有重要的意義。或單以貨幣的共通性爲基礎；或基於貨幣的共同依存性，即以貨幣對外價値的相互依存爲紐帶，由經濟最優越的一國作經濟的甚至政治的支配。前者如以法國爲首的金集團；後者如以英國爲支配中心的英鎊集團，及以美國爲支配上心的美元集團是。</p>
<p>現世界中能够稱得起龐大貨幣集團的也就只有這三個。日本雖正和僞滿相結合而進行其遠東貨幣集團，但畢竟爲了它的金融勢力還太欠缺，尙不能具有世界性。就連上述三個集團中，金集團也僅能保持其「尙未崩潰」的境地，目前正在動盪徘徊之中，勢力一天一天的削弱，法郎地位亦搖搖欲墜，前途未可逆料。所以，實際在世界上爭雄最熱烈的就祇有美元和英鎊集團。美元集團以美國爲首，包括了中美洲的墨西哥·危地馬拉·宏都拉斯·藤爾瓦多·尼加拉瓜·巴拿馬·哥斯達立加，西印度羣島的古巴·海地·聖多明谷，南美洲的委內瑞拉·科倫比亞·秘魯·厄瓜多爾·玻利維亞·巴西·智利，以及斐列濱等·英鑛集團以英國爲首，包括帝國內諸自治領屬地及瑞典·挪威·丹麥·芬蘭·葡萄牙阿根廷等·加拿大雖然是英國的屬領，然而經濟關係和美國特別密切，一九三三年也曾跟隨着美兀把幣價下跌，也有人把它包括在美元之內；但英國現正極力拉緊這個環子，運用帝國中央銀行的活動，以加强英加的關係，而抵抗美國的勢力。這也可以說美元英鎊兩集團所爭奪的對象。</p>
<p>（四）美元與英鎊的戰爭</p>
<p>國際貨幣戰爭的歷史已經不淺，其具體表戰爭之開始奢爲一九三一年十月英國的禁金出口，放棄金本位。金本位放棄後，鎊價劇烈下跌，英國對外貿易以滙市的刺激，突占優勢，不僅歐洲各國受其壓倒，且侵奪了日本及美國的商品市塲。接着，日本也放棄金本位了。至一九三三年四月，美國也正式宜吿停止兌現，脫離金本位，實行貨幣貶値，以與英日抗戰。而美之和英鎊所表現的鬥爭，則更爲深刻。一九三三年夏倫教世界經濟會議卒以美國不願穩定滙價。英美對立無可協調爲其主因，宜吿破裂。自後，兩國貨幣爭霸迄未寗息。一方面運用巨額平準基金，作滙兌的傾銷；方面復結成龐大的集團，割取世界金融領域。美國且除了向世界大量收購黃金之不足，又制定上述的銀政策，公布購銀法令，實行積極購銀。</p>
<p>前面已經說過，美國實行白銀政策除了極少部分爲基於其國內的動機外，主要是企圖操縱世界銀市，以爲國際余融鬥爭的武器。並藉此以控制採用金滙兌本位制及銀本位制各國的貨幣樣，俾擴大美元集團的勢力圈。其中允以攫奪中國貨幣爲最主要的目標；如果中國貨幣加入了美元集團，則這一塊龐大的市塲，就不難由美國來操縱了。</p>
<p>（五）英美在華貨幣戰爭</p>
<p>美國對於中國貨幣權的野心很早就已表現，一九三〇年甘末爾計畫是預備把中國的貨幣單位和美元直接連繫，以便發展美國在中國的貿易和投資；但這個計書其後因種種關係，不曾實現。</p>
<p>至上决採用攻勢的銀政策以後，不幸反因加强中國金融恐慌太甚，而招致中國的恩感。那時却便宜了英國，英國一方面暗中作有計晝的搗亂，一方面在表面上討好中國；它也是計畫把中國的貨幣圈人英鎊集團，中國的貨幣單位去跟英鎊走。當時中國加入英鎊集團的聲浪已開始非常高漲，美國爲了顧慮中國之趨於極端，卒不得不稍稍緩和其購銀的程序。</p>
<p>然而，到了上月初，中國終於實行新貨幣政策了。這個政策雖然不是正式加入英鎊鎊集團，但至少對於英國是相當有利。而在美國方面，却並不發生好感，相反的，由於英國的活躍，顯然表示不歡的態度。因此，兩國在華的貨幣鬥爭，暗中又急劇地進行起來。</p>
<p>這次美國在倫敦减少購銀，主要的也可說是表現了以中國貨幣　爭奪對象的英美新的鬥爭階段之開始。日前銀派領袖湯姆斯曾公開發表攻擊英國的言論，他指斥英國吸收中國貨幣擴大英鎊集團的謀畫，並明白聲稱英鎊集團爲對抗美國的組織。美國不得不起而對付之。除了對英國開始正面攻擊以外，同時亦　美國對於中國的示威；美國或將以破壞中國余融市塲作爲威脅，與中國直接交涉，要求改變現行貨幣政策，俾有利於美國，至少須排斥英國的治動。這種發展並非絕無可能；倘使英美在華鬥爭眞的達到了沸點，並揪起一種更嚴重的金融風潮，則中國在夾板中所受的犧牲，實在太覺可怕了。我們不能絕對信任過份樂觀論奢，以爲中國現時金融狀勢頗爲穩固，外滙亦形安定，力足以打破浪潮的襲來。實質上，目下中國幣制雖名義上已經解除了白銀的束縛，但到底不能完全脫離白銀；中國的國際支付也依然是要用銀核算的。在承平時代，中國對於國際滙兌或可由中中交三行無限制買賣外滙來安定；可是貿賣外滙的基金還不曾離銀獨立，如果銀市有變，自將直接影響中國安定滙兌的基金量。幾日來滙市情形，實已露維持吃力之苦，而允以昨（二十日）今（二十一日）兩日爲最甚，其前途正未可逆料。或謂英國可以援助中國，而昨日（二十日）滙豐力拋遠期，似確有維持外滙之意義；但英國眞能爲中國賣力嗎？實際上還不是爲了維持它自已的利益！說得乾脆些，祇是利用中國的貨幣作抵抗美元的工具而已！終局對於中國究竟有甚麼好處？</p>
<p>自然，在另一方面我們也許可以找到英美暫時的妥協點；即雙方鬥爭發展到了某一階段時，或有暫時休戰的可能（但也祇是暫時的而已）。就英國現在處境，說不定將與美國實行和解，願意和美國開談判，訂立關於在華經濟利益的協定，或以其他交換條件（如海軍會議中英美合作等等），取得美國之停止攻勢。同時，在美方面似亦未必一定要硬幹到底，中國整個市塲攪得過於混亂時，對於美國之貿易與投資，也是有弊無利的；且銀價變動過劇，如上述對其國內本身亦有不良影響；此外加害於中南美諸國常亦非淺，間接亦即美國之害。所以倘使能取得英國某種讓步，也未始沒有妥協的可能性。然而，這種妥恊的某礎，又將以誰爲主要的犧甡品呢？</p>
<h3 id="c198">山東漁業之現狀及其改進（續） <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 丁逢白</p>
<p>日本在山東靑島之漁業</p>
<p>日本的漁業勢力之侵及山東，還不是近幾年來的事，在十幾年前，日本人在山東的漁業勢力，已就異常之大。山東的兩大產魚區——威海衛和靑島，早在日人的把持和操縱之中。這主要的原因，完全是由日人能利用最進步最新式的捕魚工具和方法，復有政治力量爲之後盾，我國舊式的漁業，當然難於競爭，因之，被敗衰落，乃是必然結果。</p>
<p>日本的漁業之侵及於山東省者，最早莫過於靑島，我們可以說，靑島直是日本在山東的漁業之大本營。考日人之來靑鳥捕魚，始自民國三年，日人從德人手中奪取靑島以俱來的。當時因我國官廳給予了種種的便利，所以在民國四五六年間，靑島的日本漁船，自一〇八艘增至一百三十餘艘，而漁夫的人數，以民國五年爲最多。計爲五百六十一名。民國七年，漁船减至九十三艘，人數减至四百四十人。至民國十四年據日在靑的領事署之調查，居留民之以漁爲業者，凡四十九人，漁業勞動者有三百〇九人。民國十七年據市府修志時調查，計共有日本漁船三十四艘，內計大型帆船三十艘，小型摩托船四艘，漁夫共的有三百各。據最近調查所得，日本在靑島計有漁船四十五艘，內大型帆船三十八艘，柴油發動機船七艘，漁夫的有五百名，常居靑島，從事捕魚，並組織有靑島水產組合爲其運銷機關。（註十一）</p>
<p>此處還應當說明的是：日本的漁船，爲什麼從一〇八艘减至四十五艘呢？這是表示了日本的漁業在靑島是逐漸减低麼？當然不是的！因爲日本在最近對於山東的漁業之經營，在黃海與東海之間是以靑島爲中心，在黃海與渤海之間則以威海衛爲中心，在過去他們是專以靑島爲中心，現在則除了以靑島爲根據之外，更向威海衛一帶發展，所以在靑鳥方面，就不能不稍稍分去一部分漁業的勢力；但這並不是證明了日本在靑鳥漁業的低落，反之，却恰恰證明了日本的漁業，已由靑島而發展到全山東的產魚區域了。</p>
<p>日本在靑島所捕的魚類，以加級魚爲最多。加級魚係用蠅釣，每到春季漁汎，日船之大者，都開赴到海州加級魚大漁塲去捕獲，小船則出沒於水靈山鳥及大公島附近。夏季範圍較廣，秋季則多在搭連島千里島………一帶，計每一大型船每年所獲，爲數在七千元左右，歉收亦在二千元左右。除了加級魚之外，次爲鐵魚，以台西鎭沙子口爲最多。在民國四年間，由日本大分縣來漁船十八艘，繼又由大連來十艘，其後每年有上數艘來去，如夏季加級魚少則捕鱔魚，入秋　魚散去則捕加級魚，每當漁期之始，日人則以大公島，水靈山島，沙子口，嶸山………等爲魚塲，漁期盛時，則以千里島附近爲最盛；漁期終時，亦有遠趨嶗山灣或搭連島南行漁者。計每船所獲，年的七百元至一千三百元左右。　之爲用甚大，其鰭晒乾爲魚翅，骨可製器皿，肉鹽乾可供食，皮可熬膠，或製肉翅，肝可熬油以之製燭。所以日人獲利之大，歲以萬計。</p>
<p>其决爲比目魚及銷魚之捕取，在每一漁期內每船至少可獲五百元左右；鰲魚在每一漁期內每船可獲亦在五百元左右。此外，日人更有潛水器捕取鮑魚及海參，每船可獲一千八百元，多則在二千數百元上下。據民國二十一年時代之調查，日人在靑鳥所獲之魚共爲三，九六五，二六四貫，（每貫合一〇〇，五三三五華兩）値洋則達一，九五五，七〇八圓。（註十二）山東喪失了這樣好的漁權，今後的漁業前途，難道還堪問麼？</p>
<p>註十：見靑島市社會局向實業部之報吿，載二十三年十一月二十四日上海申報。</p>
<p>註十二：同注六。</p>
<p>改革山東漁業之計劃</p>
<p>從以上各節看來，可知山東漁業的產量，確是斐然可觀；目前已達到破敗衰頹的地步，但若能急起直追，設法挽救，爲時尙不爲遲。年來山東省的建設廳爲整頓山東沿海漁業計劃起見，會指示出了挽救的辦法多條，但多着重在治標而忽視了治本，所以該廳在其整頓山東沿海漁業計劃中說：『……現今漁業行將破產，若不即謀治標，以維持現况，恐將來益難挽救。……』他們的辦法叉是怎樣的呢？『……爲今之計，可將本塲加以擴充，改爲漁業保護局，暫購保護艦兩艘，以防海盜之用，設立魚市塲，以免魚商之剝削，設立漁民貸欵所，以便利漁民之周轉。……』</p>
<p>這些辦法，可謂着重在治標，換言之，亦即是挽救山東垂危的漁業之有效的辦法。可是，這還不够，因爲治標是暫時的一種辦法，設不以治本方面下手，治標便失了依據，縱能收相當的效力，其作用也就微乎其微。所以我主張治本治標，應當同一進行，從治本的一。方面去潵底改革山東的漁業，從治標的一方面去盡量維持目前的現狀，實施挽救的方策。單注意治本，與單偏重治標，兩者都不是完善的辦法</p>
<p>在今天，我們要實施改革山東漁業的計劃，首先還應當要明白山東漁業衰落的原因，治本和治標的方法之施行，方能兩得其便。考山東漁業之所以每况愈下的原因，歸納言之，不外下列幾點：</p>
<p>受日本魚業的排擠。日人在近來又以大連爲漁業根據地，利用新式船網，常常越界到山東濱海一帶捕魚，每逢漁汎，輒結隊而來，我山柬漁民，以强弱懸殊，競相引退，以致良好之捕魚機會，遂爲別人佔去。</p>
<p>盜匪的刦掠。山東近年來農村經濟破　，多數失業漁民，遂嘯聚成羣，出沒無定，名爲捕魚，實則專事刦財盜網，甚則沉人於海，駕船遠去，或則威脅漁民，每年須繳納一定之資金。</p>
<p>魚商的剝削。山東沿海各港，除靑島有商辦魚市塲而外，他處均由魚商經售，壟斷魚價，操縱居奇，抽扣佣金，高利盤剝。漁民大感痛苦，莫可如何，致使漁業經濟，異常恐慌。</p>
<p>保守陳法，不知改良。山東漁民，因經濟困乏，知識錮蔽，缺乏改良能力。所有漁具漁法，皆襲多年舊制，與外人角逐，顯歸失敗無疑。因此，漁民生計，日益艱蹙，舶來海產，人超益鉅，除有少數江輪尙可支持外，所有貧苦漁民，改業謀生者日多一日。這更使山東漁業，走到破產的地步。</p>
<p>我以爲堅實自己，是今日改革山東漁業最好的信條。歷年來山東漁業衰落的原因，與其謂爲受外來的壓迫與外貨的傾銷，不如從自身的改革上着想。要改革山東的漁業，應自下面各照着手：</p>
<p>設立漁業保護局。此局之設立，專用以管理全省漁業行政，及領導一切技術事宜，以發展水產，改良製造，並保護漁民之安全爲職志。竊漁業爲山東一大經濟源流，理應有專門機關爲之設計和管理，若仍由建設廳主持，往往有事務上不及兼顧之弊。歷年來山東漁業，除靑島一地而外，大多無專門機關來管理，一切任其散漫，外來的侵略旣無人去交涉，而內在的組織又缺乏高級機關爲之督促和改良，所以漁業保護局的設立，在目前是必要的。</p>
<p>興辦漁業警備隊。這是專門爲防禦海盜及外國漁船的無理侵略而設的。大槪山東沿海一帶的漁塲，都應經常駐紮警備隊以資防備，務使漁戶有所保護，不至於更受異外的損失。此種警備隊的辦理，頂好直接附屬於漁業保護局的管轄之下，俾便於直接指揮。</p>
<p>建築漁港。因爲漁港之與漁業，有着密切的關係，漁港爲魚業的根據地，非特於魚獲物之搬運販賣加工貯藏等能予以很多的便利，且與漁船之建造，碇泊泊，漁具之製作，修理，風災之避免，以及種種必需品的供給，都是在漁業經營感覺必需的。（未完）</p>

<p>唐人有山鳥自呼名詩句，留意聽之，誠然不謬，如喜鵲麻鵲之類，其鳴聲似帶有鵲鵲字音；烏鴉鳴聲似帶有鴉字音；八哥嗚聲，似帶有八哥字音；餘如割麥插禾不如歸去等烏，均係自呼其名，脫口而出。竊念烏本無知，自嗚天籟，安解自呼其名。昔人又有「一林烏語失占詩」之句，鄙意謂必係先有各鳥，而倉聖造字時，聽各鳥嗚聲，摹繪而形容之，遂訂其名，故能名稱其實。孟子有云：當堯之時，洪水橫流，獸歸鳥跡之道，交於中國。可見人類始生時，鳥獸亦同時產生，所以倉聖造字，亦係先有是事，而後爲指事象形之凑合耳。</p>

<p>— 一震</p>
<p>最近父親不知在什麼地方買來了兩隻鴿子。這對鴿子有米粉一般全白的羽毛，一雙血紅的眼珠，正如嵌着一對紅寶石，是十分美麗和聰明的，並且它們的父母又給與一副剛强的翅膀，更加增長了它們的健美。</p>
<p>第一天，它們便認識了它們的住宅，食缸，水盆，和它們的慈愛的主人。</p>
<p>父親每天辦公回家，便靠着窗口，默默地看着那對東西，有時，撒一把穀粒在食缸裏，永久滿足的鴿子老是「哆哆哆哆」的飛了過來，雖然站在牆上或屋頂上。父親給它們的名字是「阿白，」「阿白」很能聽話，常常飛來站在父親面前，可是父親提起手來想撫弄一下那潔白得可愛的羽毛時，它們又「拍拍拍」地飛了。</p>
<p>「阿白」很會撒嬌，所以父親更愛護它倆。</p>
<p>這次，父親因事晋京了，鴿子便托給我，我很擔憂他倆會有逃走的一天。他第一封信來問起一家外，又特別提到阿白的起居，父親又說，不是阿白太年輕些，他將携了它倆作長期的旅伴，或許這一封信可使阿白帶來，那比掛號還穩快。</p>
<p>父親的對待阿白，可說是無微不至，不知阿白的心坎裏已留存了父親的印像麼？</p>

<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>野鴨，又名鳩，或水鴨；據說是滋陰的，所以一到冬天，那些住居一在靠近太湖邊的人家，大都是恃捕野鴨爲生的。因爲野鴨在故鄉是一種　味中的珍物，在冬令，凡是一些上等點的酒餐席上就少不了這麼一隻菜；而且也有將帶毛的鴨作爲敬獻親友們的禮品的呢。至於價格，大約是半塊多錢一斤，這數目在我們看來雖不怎樣貴，然而在一個生活程度極低的窮僻鄉邑中，實在是可以算得是不很尋常了。現在我且將它的捕捉和煮食方法寫在後面：</p>
<p>捕捉　鴨善於飛翔，所以捕捉不易，但在故鄉我所知道的却有三種：　用鳥槍射擊。可是這方法用者不多，因爲野鴨的肉內一經鉛珠遺留，共味便會失却鮮美，並且在吃的時侯還要當心給鉛珠損壞牙磁。　用天網捕捉。不過這方法很麻煩；必須預先捕得一隻小野鴨，和自已的家鴨一起飼養，待其長大，卽將它的翼毛尖端剪去，使得它雖能飛而不會高翔；這樣，再加一番訓練的工夫，然後便在湖上張起一個網，在網的領域裏放些穀類，同時把那隻「鴨媒頭」也放在中間，讓它去自由跳躍，等到有野鴨羣經這裏飛過，它也會在網邊上亂飛，於是往往有些野鴨會被誘引羅網裏來。那時預伏在蘆席中的捕捉者，就可將網門收煞，使許多活躍的野鴨都變成了他網中的囚徒。　是用仙人跳的；那是幾根竹爿和一條苧繩，他們隔夜在蘆席叢里去佈置好十個或二十個竹弓，在那彈簧機括上安放些食物，到第二天絕早去取，那末這幾十隻仙人跳上總會有一兩雙野鴨給軋住的。</p>
<p>煮食　要吃野鴨，關於野鴨的煮食是應當知道的；因爲野鴨不比家鴨，它常棲息水中，食魚蝦爲生，故腥味極重，允其是在拔毛時要注意。—野鴨毛要乾拔，不可打潮，軟毛及血管毛要拔得凈，不可讓它留下一根毛脚，然後方可下水開肚。不過煮法也有兩種，但須看吃的人的性情愛好，　用薺菜生炒，和肉絲或純鴨都可以。　買　豬肉半斤，塞在一隻鴨肚裏，以炒鍋在炭火上煨之，但是酒須放得多些，吃時最好趁熱，重燒的不但味遜，而且腥氣不堪。</p>

<h3 id="c211">談孔雀 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 紙帳銅瓶室主</p>
<p>羽禽中不乏允物，孔雀其一也。形略似雉，體長三尺餘，翼短小，雄者特壯麗，尾有長羽，金色有翠綠斑紋，作眼球形，排列於上，極絢爛，產於熱帶地，吾國園囿所蓄，多由印度羣島暹羅輸入。</p>
<p>孔雀之傳入我國，由來甚早，逸周書云：「方人以孔鳥。」古與雁及翡翠並稱，太玄經：「孔雁之儀，可法則也」，注：「雁飛成行，孔雀亦成行也」，通鑑：「齊和帝中興元年，以金銀爲鎧胄，具裝飾以孔翠」，注：「孔雀翡翠」，孔雀又有蛇偶之說，南越志：「孔雀不必匹合，止以音影相接便孕，亦與蛇偶」，茅亭客話云：「蛇與孔雀偶，有得其卵者，使雞抱伏即成，其名日都護」。</p>
<p>捕孔雀法，據云：「孔雀自喜其尾，凡欲山棲，必先擇有置尾之地，然後止。捕之者，輒候雨甚，尾霑雨而重，不能高翔，人雖至，因愛其尾，恐爲所傷，不複騫翥，捕者得而擒之</p>
<p>雀屏中選，此禽爲人媒也。然亦有同類爲媒者，北戶錄云：「以馴養之孔雀，誘致野孔雀，呼曰孔雀媒」。</p>
<p>孔雀性喜舞，不讓今之摩登士女也，紀聞云：「孔雀聞管絃笙歌，必舒張翅尾，盼睇自舞，畫斷云：「新羅國獻孔雀，解舞，德宗，召邊　於眞武門，寫貌」，異物志云：「孔雀拍手則舞」。晋公卿贊云：「世祖時西城獻孔雀，解人語，彈指應節起舞。李昉詞云：「孔雀雙迎日舞」。</p>
<p>異名甚多，如鐘會孔雀賦：「有炎方之偉鳥」。本草：「孔雀一名越烏，時珍曰：「孔大也」，梵書謂之摩由羅」。談苑：「李珣蓄五禽，孔雀曰南客」。</p>
<p>秘藏記：「孔雀王母菩薩，左手持開蓮，右手持孔雀尾」。蓋孔雀素有九德之號，佛以喻比丘之行儀也。</p>
<p>頃見前人佚書晝鑒，載：「徽宗命學人畫孔雀升墩障屏，大不稱旨。復命餘子决第呈進，有極盡工力亦不得用者，乃相與指闕陳請所謂，旨曰：「凡孔雀升墩，必先左脚，卿等所圖俱先右脚」，騐之信然，羣遂服其格物之精」。</p>
<p>孔雀見人美衣飾輒展翅，俗曰開屏，予曩在吳門，遊涵碧山莊。孔雀　於巨籠中，有靚裝少艾，姍姍行過其前，孔雀似不甘自晦，乃舒其華羽，綺錯晃耀，彷彿雲霞變色，詫爲奇觀。</p>
<p>前淸時之冠飾，以孔雀翎施於冠後，猶古之珥貂也。其初皆出於酬庸曠典，惟有功而蒙特恩者，始得賞戴。咸豐以後，名器倖濫，又定報捐花翎之例，於是五品以上之官，皆得援例捐納，不復重視。惟大臣之賞戴雙眼花翎，則仍出於特恩，若三眼花翎，惟親王貝勒始得戴之，與欽賜黃馬褂同爲貴重。前人詩云：「冠飄孔翠大風細，衣染鵝黃御氣濃」。即指此也</p>
<p>有所謂孔雀花者，其殆以形似而名歟。見南越筆記：「瓊州有孔雀花，苦熱詩：「葛衣半解方流汗，凍殺牆陰孔雀花」。花性宜陰濕，對之生寒。故云。又有所謂孔雀石者，色鮮綠有光，以綵紋如孔雀尾者允珍貴，用爲簪環等裝飾物，粉末可爲顏科。</p>
<p>「孔雀有金翠，初春乃生，三四月後凋與花萼俱哀榮」。見埤雅。「孔雀毛着龍腦則相綴，物類相感也」，見羣莊漫錄，「孔雀迎晨則鳴相和」，見異物志：「雲南郡出孔雀，常以二來翔，月餘而去」，見華陽國志，以上諸說，均爲近世動物學家所未道，足資研究者也。</p>
<p>古人詠歎孔雀，不乏名句，韓愈云：「翠角高獨聳，金花煥相差」。皮日休云：「强聽紫　時欲舞，困眠紅樹似依屏」，李郢云：「一身金翠畫不得，萬重山川來者稀」。薛能云：「曾處嶂中眞霧隱，每過庭下似春來」，皆可誦也。</p>

<p>貧愚　散，爲農村破產的最大原因，然而貧還可用種種䆅極的方法來使他富，愚　可用敎育力量來使他智，散還可用政治組織來使他團結：惟身體裏弱，精神不振，旣不能用腦力以求學問，又不能用體力以負重擔，更不能用餘力爲社會服務，影響之大，較貧愚散，不知要高出幾倍。故農民不講衛生，多生疾病，實佔農村破產各原因中的重要部分，試舉要言之：農民旣身弱多病，一年中消耗於迷信一途的金錢，不知要多少，雖借債典衣以過其迷信痴夢，亦所不惜；旣病，當然不能工作，不工作，卽不能生產，以勞力所人爲生活的農民，怎經得起長時期的坐食？再加以醫藥的消耗，萬一不幸，一命嗚呼，中產的農家，就可因此破家，其下者更不論了；凡此種種，僅就有形方面而言，其他無形的損失，更不可勝計，由此看來，農村需要衛生的急切，可謂十分嚴重，今將中華職業敎育社主辦的滬郊農村改進區衛生設施狀况，舉其大要，以供有志鄕村衛生事業者參考。</p>
<p>訓練衛生人　我國鄕村衛生事業，尙在萌芽時代，衛生人才，眞是十分缺乏，政府旣困於財力，勢難顧及鄕僻的衛生，醫生又因生活關係，鮮能深入農村，自非就本在農村工作人員，加以相當的衛生訓練，以謀衛生空氣，散佈於鄕村不爲功。該區有見及此，特設立衛生訓練班，每週集合全區工作同志，及地方靑年，訓練一全日；凡衛生的常識，急救的手續，預防的方法，醫藥的大要，均由專門醫生，詳爲指導，並加實習—繼續不斷的訓練並無限期—如是無形中，全區四十五方里之內，就可增加數十個有衛生智識的人員，辦理區內衛生工作，費省而效宏，是爲窮幹的一法。</p>
<p>實施衛生敎育　農民疾病之多，迷信之盛，實由缺乏衛生常識之故，醫藥是救急之一法，敎育乃根本之良圖，僅注意於醫藥的療治，而不注意於衛生的敎育，是無異舍本而逐末。敎育之法，先就區內小學，一律加授衛生功課，指示其常識，矯正其習慣，檢查其缺點，醫治其疾病，指導其簡易治療，如是全區小學生，都有一些衛生常識。同時就民衆敎育塲所，儘量利用機會，將日常衛生事項，普遍施敎，尤其注意於女子方面，蓋女子能明白衛生，對於家庭衛生就有辦法。</p>
<p>注重預防工作　在都市地方，春秋有牛痘的施種，夏季有霍亂瘧痢的預防，故一切傳染病，較鄕村爲少：蓋衛生最大的目的，重在預防於未病，若已病而救治，已是臨渴掘井，策之下者。然鄕僻之區，怎會有人來實施預防工作。鄕民死亡率之高，不爲無因；他們看到這點，一年以來，特別注意於傳染病的預防。對於天花霍亂的預防，已收到滿意的效果，惟於瘧疾的預防，比較複雜而費大，尙無相當方法，而今年滬閔路一帶的瘧患，特別嚴重，患者竟占百分之三十以上，尤其是發現惡性瘧疾，更爲危險，事實如此，他們的憂慮更甚，目前指定一地，實行騐血工作，根本治療辦法，還是求從滅蚊方面，加以努力。由是以觀，益可知疾病預防的重要。</p>
<p>勵行公共衛生、內地公共地方，不但毫無衛生設施，且隨處表示不衛生的惡現象，影饗所及，足以釀成可怖之疫癘。然鄕民素無衛生智識，公共衛生，更不在他們心上，惟有用敎育的力量，慢慢的移風易俗，同時帮助其改良一切設備。如隨地的露天坑，爲蒼蠅的大本營，具設法改良：齷齪的垃圾堆，為傳染病的製造所，則多設垃圾箱；公用水桶的不潔，足以妨礙全村村民的健康，則改進其設備，並訂公的以限制；，又如田中的浮厝，路旁的腐死的動物，力以取締，能如此，鄕村公共衛生，大致不差矣。他們對於這各方面，正在努力的做上去，並在區內適當地方，設立公共衛生實騐區，爲各村模範，尙有相當成效，得到中外衛生家的贊同。吾想公共衛生，能辦有成績，於民衆健康，一定可以增加極大的幸福。</p>
<p>診療疾病　鄕民貧窮者多，有了病，請不起醫生，更無錢買藥，於是不得不乞靈於神明的仙方，卒致不治者，往往有之。故在目前診療疾病，還是極占重要，現在全區已設診療所一處，簡易診療所三處，簡易藥庫七處，鄕民有病，都可就近求治，旣不需要診金，貧苦者，還要給藥，並得滬郊恊進會衛生委員會之助，每週有專門醫師，指導治療方法，解决一切困難問題，民衆受益不淺。</p>
<p>該區在去年工作開始之時，卽以醫藥爲入手，繼之以一切衛生工作，以後推行其他事業，均順利無阻，農村需耍衛生之重要，可以想見。而事實吿訴我們，農村需要衛生，實已萬分急切，苟能努力於衛生，小之足以减少民衆疾病，增加生產力量，大之足以强健民衆體魄，發揮愛國精神。故復興農村，復興民族，與衛生工作，隨處有直接間接的關係也。</p>

<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之十五—</p>
<p>在一座埃及人的陵墓的墻壁上，繪着許多人物。其中有一個少年，他有一隻成爲廢物的腿。生在現代的我們，能够看着那幅圖書而且說：書中的少年是患小兒驚風的。我們知道他的背髓的某部分是受了某程度的影響的；我們確切知道這個，正和我們知道畫中另一人手裏握着的一束麥是從植在地下的麥子長出來的一樣確切。可是古代的埃及人對那少年作如何想呢？你們以爲他們也像我們一般會想到他的身體的內部有了異於常人的變化嗎？他們是不會想到的；卽使想到，也是無法發見。因爲當時的僧人們不許　究者割裂死後的身體；他所能辦到的只是記錄身體外部的變化而已。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>在長久的時期內，病理學家們所能幹的，只是把他們能在身體上而察看出來的各種外部變化加以類別，把類似的變化綜合成組。當他們發見一組無變異或略有繼異的症候的時候，他們就給予一個名稱。這樣，以發疹的現象與隨伴的症候的不同爲基礎，雪定罕（Sydenham）定了「麻疹」這個名稱，以示與「猩紅熱」有別。阿里替斯（Aretaeus）加於糖尿病的解釋—「肉的消解，隨尿排出」—也是屬於此種病理研究方法的。在把各種常見的疾病如是分門別類和定了名稱以後，又把每一組症候的原因和結果—致死的頻數—加以測記。當疾病的進行是在身體表面或附扳身體表面—例如沾梁的創傷，或皮層毒瘤，或扁桃腺炎—的時候，關於大體的組織變化是可以給發見的。可是，假如當疾病的進行是藏匿在內部器官的時候，那就怎樣呢？遠在文藝復興期以後，禁止解剖入體的戒律，顯然是把對於死後人體更深一層的組織的任何察騐阻北了的。</p>
<p>自然，這樣的情况促成了關於疾病與研究方法的個人理論的幻想興起。這些理論與方法對於我們還有着某種凄鬱的興味，因爲牠們和今日的所謂「痊愈崇拜」，例如：折衷療治，推拿，不藥治療等—是這麼扳似。加於一切例子的聰明的法則，都是相同的。這些方法都是屬於演繹的—以理論起頭，然後搜尋事實以證明理論。要是他們發見了與理論不相符的事實，他們就以傲慢的漢視處置這事實—好像這事實並不存在的樣子。這情形的發生是難怪的，因爲當時的病理學者無法實施屍體檢騐，顯微鏡尙未發明，他們又不知道細菌學或生理化學。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（七十六）膽石症Cholelithiasis（中）</p>
<p>問　膽石症發生後起什麼麼病狀？</p>
<p>答　膽石存在時，臨症上有時不發什麼症狀的。但膽石增大的時候，在腹壁外可以觸和腫物的地位。最普通的病狀是疝痛。</p>
<p>問　膽石疝痛的發作，有怎樣的痛苦。</p>
<p>答　膽石疝痛的發作，是突然的：疼痛的部位是肝臟部；那時有穿刺性或破裂性激痛。病人因此有絕叫呻吟的痛苦。這是因爲膽石向膽道內移動而刺激排泄管黏膜而起：所以膽石愈大而愈尖銳，那末痛苦愈劇烈。</p>
<p>問　膽石怎樣能移動呢？</p>
<p>答　膽石移動的原動力，計有膽管肌的收縮，膽汁鬱積，腹壁緊張，腸蠕　等。此外還有因爲身體的劇動，騎馬，乘車，跳舞，攝食過量，姙娠，月經中，憤怒，驚愕等，做他的誘因。</p>
<p>問　疝痛的發作，有一定的時間和部分嗎？</p>
<p>答　疝痛的發作，大槪在晚間或深夜。痛的部分雖一定在肝臟部然往往放散到右肩，右臂和右胸部。</p>
<p>問　疝痛發作的時候，全身起有什麼另外的病狀？</p>
<p>答　體往往惡寒戰慄而發熱，有惡心嘔吐和冷汗。脈搏微弱，有時竟致人事不省，痙攣等。</p>
<p>問　在疝痛發作中，病人的呼吸和體位，有異狀嗎？</p>
<p>答　因爲要避免肝臟部的壓迫，所以呼吸很淺。體位大都屈膝而向右側蜷臥。</p>
<p>問　在身體的外表，對於膽石部分，有可以探知的情形嗎？</p>
<p>答　膽囊部稍隆起，有壓病，見膽囊和肝臟的增大。</p>
<p>問　膽石疝痛發作後，全身皮膚等有什麼異狀？</p>
<p>答　一二日之內，全體皮膚黏膜起黃疸；小便也呈薑黃色；大便却因爲膽汁缺乏而呈灰白色。</p>
<p>問　膽石的存在，可以用X光錢照出影像嗎？</p>
<p>答　因爲膽石的成分是不透光性，所以能用X光綫照射出陰影來的，並且藉此可以斷定膽石的地位，大小，和數目</p>
<p>問　疝痛發作的時期，有多少長久？</p>
<p>答　少的一二小時，多的數天；有時間歇的發作。</p>
<p>問　疝痛發作的消散，其原因何在？</p>
<p>問　疝痛發作的消散，不外乎膽石從輸膽管移到腸內，或反向膽囊進入，或安定停留在膽管內而黏膜和膽管肌的收縮休止時，也有膽石落入廣闊的輸膽管中時或膽石崩碎的時候。這些都是疝痛消散的原因。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（七十四）氣管及氣管枝異物</p>
<p>耳內異物，鼻內異物及咽喉異物。我已分別論過。現在最後所述的一瀰異物。就是氣管及氣管枝的異物。乃四種當中最危險的一種。牠　可由喉頭異物轉變醇成（參照上一期）。但是牠的最大原因。實在是基因於吸引的一個作用。當兒童遊戲時，口內常常含有物體。倘若突然發生啼泣，大笑或驚愕。則口內物體，卽可隨着吸氣。一同吸入氣管及氣管枝內。而成氣管及氣管枝異物。所以氣管及氣管枝異物的成立。必須倚賴吸引的一個作用。這是很明白的事實。成人口內含物的時候。通常是極少的。所以就是有吸引作用。亦無禍可惹。兒童則最好口內含物。而啼泣與驚愕的機曾亦多。以致口內物體，隨時可以憑着吸氣。一同吸入氣管及氣管枝。卒成氣管及氣管枝異物。故本症由事實上的瞪明及臨床上的報吿。概以五歲以下的兒童爲最多。</p>
<p>氣管及氣管枝異物的種類。要算竹製或白鐵製的小口笛（俗稱叫叫），果核，豆類，米粒，食物殘片，棋子及鈕扣等物爲最多。决爲金屬片，骨片及貨幣等類。</p>
<p>氣管及氣管校異物的卞耍症候。厥惟咳嗽的頻發。殆爲必發的症候。且多陷於呼吸障碍。此時若不立刻設法取出異物。卽能引起氣管枝炎，肺炎及窒息等等危險症狀。因此而致命的亦很多。此外有可注意的。就是小形異物深入氣管枝後。咳嗽發作可以暫時停止。往往疑心已無異物存在。但是結果依舊惹起氣管枝炎，肺炎等症候。這種異物在醫學上。特稱之爲慢性異物。</p>
<p>本症最確實的診斷。莫如應用愛克司光的透照及攝影。或行直接的氣管枝鏡檢查法。牠的惟一治療方法。就是在確定異物的部位後。先行挿入氣管鏡。再用鉗子摘除。若在呼吸困難著明的時候。則當首先施行氣管切開。以救呼吸。然後再爲設法摘出異物。</p>
<p>本症雖可設法急救。但是究屬危險。家族方面又多不願手術。且內地醫院亦未必具備此種特殊的醫用器械。所以牠的安全簡單辦法。還是注電預防法。預防法中最緊要的有四點。卽</p>
<p>哺乳兒尙未發生齒牙。對於咀嚼作用尙付　如的時候。切不可給與有核或硬固的食物（允以在啼哭的時候）。</p>
<p>父母應當敎導兒童。於遊戲時，勿以口笛，果核，豆類，棋子，鈕扣，金屬片及貨幣等物。含在口內。</p>
<p>竹製或白鐵的小口笛（俗稱叫叫），遊戲時乃完全靠着口唇的吸氣作用。方可發音。所以最易吸人氣道。希望爲父母的，切勿買給兒童爲要。</p>
<p>應當取締販賣這一類口笛的小販。</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第八一間）急性症候發作時面部起什麼變化？</p>
<p>（答）面部近患牙那邊，大槪浮腫高起。</p>
<p>（第八二問）急性症候怎樣歸結？</p>
<p>（答）大的不出一週，膿汁多自然的貫通牙床骨，向頰邊或唇邊牙肉穿出。膿汁排放盡後，一切症狀，迅速消失。　用手術切開或車開放膿，則症象可早日消退。然多數患者，腫痛消退後，以為病患已去，不再求醫治。以致病根未去，膿茵潛伏，流為慢性牙根膜炎，經年累月，遇身體虛弱抵抗力低時，又復發爲急性，循環往復，賊害健康。</p>
<p>（第八三問）急性發作時期，能够發生什麼危險？</p>
<p>（答）能發生三種危險：　如病患蔓延，不幸膿毒波及顎骨，則發生蜂窩組織炎，醫治不易。　如膿汁積蓄過久，其毒素常被血液吸收，致增加全身的症候如果膿茵自身入血，則變爲敗血症，熱度增高，脈弱，嘔吐，狀類虛脫，很爲危險。　當膿汁澎漲欲求出路時，並無一定方向，惟阻力薄弱之處是竄。有時竟會貫通顎骨，穿出面頰外邊或　部，永留疤痕，破壞容貌。或者會竄入頭向內部重要孔穴，如入上顎竇，則成上顆竇炎，醫治亦是很費力的</p>

<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>十六日路透電，德元首希特勒著「我的奮鬥」一書，內有一章，將「黑人與華人」並列而論，對我中國人，頗有侮辱之處，我駐德劉大使已向德政府作非正式之談話，德宣傳部長戈培爾之代理芬克，已允於該書冉版時將該章修正或予以取銷云。希氏爲今日歐洲幻想「第三帝國」之英雄，在他處，正有人「聞風而起」，英雄狂熱，現正瀰漫於世界，我們在他們的脚下，瞥見了無數仇　與怨恨。意大利的向阿比西尼亞進攻，就是要以希氏所稱爲「劣等民族」的黑人的血和肉，去凝成法西期英雄的寶座。據希氏在他所著「我的奮鬥」一書中，把全世界人民分成兩等：一等是所謂「劣等民族」，如現在正被意大利進攻的阿比西尼亞一類的黑人，和同樣正在被日本「親善」「提携」的「華人」，都屬於這一類。這類「劣等民族」，天然「注定命苦」，是應該被立在對面的所謂「優等民族」任意侵略宰割的，劣等民族，命定的是他們自稱優等民族的犧牲品。另一等便是希氏所自稱爲「優等的民族」這一類中，也有區別，全世界的白人（蘇聯除外（，雖然同是天定的優等民族，有「上帝」賜與的剝削劣等民族的天然權利，但在這許多優等民族中，還有「最優等的民族」。這全世界「最優等的民族」是在何處呢？希特勒得意的說：就甚德國！，於是，德國就天然是全世界上最優等的民族所組成的國家，它對於世界任何其他民族與國家，天定的都有任意侵入加以宰割剝削的權能。這是自命當代大英雄希特勒氏，在共所著「我的奮鬥」一書中，所竭力表現的他最正確的民族觀與世界觀。</p>
<p>希氏的民族觀與世界觀如上所述，自然，在他這一「原理」之下，我們一「苦命」的中國人，當然是現世界中的「最劣等民族」無疑的了。龐承希氏能「高抬貴手」，把我們這個在現世界中最不堪的劣等民族，還得和「高等白人」一向所最看不起的「黑奴」並列一起，致一般中國人認爲是侮辱，我國駐德大使去非正式向德政府提出了抗議，可是黑種的阿比西尼亞現在竟不甘再居於劣等，舉起了反帝國抗意的大旗，和意大利飛機炸彈，堅决抗鬥，它現在已想從「最劣等的民族」而飛躍進入於世界最優等的民族之隊裏去了。光榮的「最優等民族」的頭銜事實上是要從全民族的奮鬥血路中才奪得到手的！則可恥的「最劣等民族」的頭銜，也應從全民族的奮鬥血路中去洗刷才是。</p>
<h3 id="c219">東京之朝 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>一塊錢買來的小鐘，和我做了年餘的伴侶，而今在寂寞的屋子裏停止了答答作響。可是這回我忘了無鐘之苦，因爲每當我大淸早醒來時，一望見南向朝窗的畫壁上，我便辨淸了：太陽光映到畫裏的一派有如秋風蕭蕭吹過的松林處，大的是六點半時分，倘中間有橋有水的地方，已現着黃金色，黃金色裏又帶照到窗外的綠葉影，那是七點多，再斜上去，已八時外了。</p>
<p>雖然見畫裏樹影動，卽知窗外有些冷風在飄，可是看到黃金色的太陽光，牠便有力量使我爬起來。在這裏，我也就重新發覺了朝氣的鮮美，是最能使人淸醒的時候呢！爬起後首先胃了一陣冷，卽立刻望着窗外叢林縫裹，遙遙露閃紅霞，而使人不由不心神一新。我到這島國後，因此，便習慣了早起。洗過冷水臉，靜靜對着叢林縫間的紅光點點頭，就推過玻璃門，踏着悉悉作饗的沙石小路，沿國籬，木屋板走過去。小溝的水悠悠緩流着甜靜淸幽的朝氣裹，紅的，黃的，紅黃參半的，綠的樹葉，默默陪着沉息的溫雅的家家的牆窗，配着天上浩碧的藍雲。我這時全忘記了我的落拓，異國的流浪，和積重的哀感。只一邊走，一邊兒聽着自家的木展踏着沙石路的怪有意趣聲調，而沉醉在這靜謐的，有如秀美的農村的處所。久在翻騰的波濤裏打滾的流浪者，是能够獲得這一瞬的安息麼？有時自己發覺了自己時，還假做着夢兒醒來，驚問自家兒呵！</p>
<p>踏完沙石路，前而已有馬蹄聲鏗鏘，這兒是馬塲，隔一條曠長的大馬路，那面便是高田馬塲的山岡草原了。我從山岡的萋萋猶未黃的綠草上，再掠過碧空，望着鮮紅的太陽，脚步是更輕快而加緊了，爬上山岡，常因露水正溶，高斜而上的士地濕滑而跌下，可是登高在山岡綠草上，是太淸新了。</p>
<p>秋是殘了，天氣還是十分高爽，蔚藍的朝雲，浮在鮮白的淸瑩的晨空中。迎面飄來的風確是冷，但我只覺吹得我的腦袋輕鬆淸快，述身上的衣服都嫌笨重了。冷風在這時，變成値得人感謝的了。太陽光映醒木地上的生物。站花高原上，俯望火車路旁的一帶樹林，烏兒迎着太陽飛起，鴉聲雖不妙，總也跟着表徵向上的情調，林中狗兒揚長出現，後面便接着有人露臉。隱隱又有鷄啼聲，靜謐裏諦聽凝神，另有一種非都市問所有的意境。</p>
<p>山岡下，土洞前，蓬草爲門的窟邊，無家的流浪人，靜靜的，露着孤獨的臉容，坐着晒太陽。我細心注視，才知他面前已用亂草燒過了一堆火，灰燼還微微有烟。這時候，人們是升上火盆了，這些沒有家的流浪人的十窟，是倍加寒冷了！</p>
<p>再沿左側看過去，幾所低矮的破木屋，凄肅的現着，一家門口，站着一個小女孩，伸出一雙紅凍的冷顫的小手兒，大槪亦是在望着太陽吧！可惜太陽很難照到被山岡遮蔽着的山岡下。</p>
<p>我就常常沉醉在這淸秀，溫靜，鮮爽，幽潔的朝氣裏，默默望着整個籠罩在沉息的東京，而忘記了自己的哀傷。然而，靜靜的時候，正是深深落在沉思中，俯對着山岡下的破屋前的凄凉的小女孩，草窟旁的無家的流浪兒，自家一個拓落憔悴的影兒，重新搖幌着，這異國的鮮美淸澄的朝晨呵—雖會使我暫時忘記這無限的哀傷，但却埋葬不了牠！</p>

<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>那是兩年前的事，我還是剛離開學校不久，我悄悄地又流落在離自已的家不遠的台城。那時，從郊野和河面掠來的風多麼寒冷地在淸潔而齊整的馬路上飄襲着，我跟其他許多已失業和剛從學校跑出來的靑年們同樣地掛上了憂鬱和焦急的神情，在一羣一羣的知識分子的圈子里跑來跑去的。照例地，作新印刷公司里而做成了這許多不相識的人們來來去去的會集的地方了。</p>
<p>余老板是個樂天派的人，他總是咬着烟斗慢慢地噴出了一朶一朶的灰白色的烟圈，瞪着一些跑進來購買文具的學生們，和從鄉村里跑出來的婦女們，但是，他却能够一方面應一些收賬的來客和商店里的事務，一方面却很　轉地招呼這許多來來去去的己做過敎員或奢未曾做過敎員的年靑人，他的樣子，倒使我覺得他是極其忙碌的人了，可是，事實上，他又安閒得很，每天總有四五决的帶着這些客人們跑到茶室裏去消磨一些時光，這當然是他的闊綽的好處，事實上，整個縣鄉里，允共是整個縣城里，一切的學校用具和印刷物都集中在他的公司里，而且，這許多年靑人，中年人，都是他的顧客了。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，我那時還是剛剛認識他的，因爲我常常到他店里去睡一些在找職業的朋友，臂如有希望做到校長的人們，這樣，我就有幾决的被余老板「請客」了。而且，我每天都到他那裏去，除了跟老板談話以外，我很可以淸楚地看到許多比我遠要徬徨的人們的焦急的臉孔的。有一天，我從一個金融業家而同時又是縣議員的事務所裏帶着苦悶的氣息，同時叉是失望的影子跑到作新印刷所裏，余老板就笑着的對我說：</p>
<p>「鳳兄，你知道？平周有希望做日昇小學校的校長了，他跟你是兄弟，你總可以安穩地得到一個職位的，我祝賀你呵！」</p>
<p>說着，他的酒醉了似的紅紅的臉孔興奮地笑着，痙攣個不停　。</p>
<p>我給他這一說，就馬上拿着電話機，給平周打了一個電話：</p>
<p>「怎麼？你記着，我跟你是同樣患過苦難的人呵！」</p>
<p>可是，從電筒裏傳來給我的嚴重的打擊的話：</p>
<p>「這，實在不容易的，你知道，就是我做了校長了，請敎員也沒有我的權，現在，是由校董會指派的，根據族譜上的房份多少，每房佔幾個敎員，事實上，目前在家裏，賦閒着的知識分子，從上海，北平，廣州回來的，同時又有大批縣立中學，師範學校跑出來的，已有一百多個了，這十來個敎位，怎麼方可以分派得妥當呢？鳳弟，你是有志氣的，爲什麼會跑回來找這沒有出息的小敎員做呵！你須應努力，你可以有更好的出路呵！」</p>
<p>我怔着了，我歎了一口氣的把電話停下來，在我的腦袋裏盤旋着的盡是難過的影子……我到那兒去呢？沒有職業怎麼可以過活呢？鄕村里的敎育已滾到這樣險惡的圈子裏了。</p>
<p>「說起來也難怪，」余老板噴了一股烟，張着嘴兒輕笑了一下。望着我說「我們鄕族里也是一樣，爲了校長，敎員叨鬥打了起來，大家都做了仇人，學生少了，要做敎員的人却太多了。這世界，跟我們做生意一樣的難做了，我們的生意表面上還算不錯，但是，欠的賬是無法收結的。比方，這學校鬧風潮，一換了校長，新的校長就不管理，也不肯負責舊校長所欠下來的印費了。實在……。」</p>
<p>老板歎了一口氣，望着在座那些，我不認識的人們說：</p>
<p>「你們那邊怎麼樣子，酈先生，打架的事有了段落嗎？」</p>
<p>坐在我對面的一個高高的穿着西裝　人苦笑了一下說：</p>
<p>「這是天下的奇聞了，已上課的敎員也被無理由地驅逐走了，而且打鬥了起來，事實上，這是鄉族里有勢力的人們互相鬥爭的把戲！」</p>
<p>「把戲！」余老板笑着的望着我說：「鳳兄！你聽到嗎？縣立師範的校長是××總司令的命令委下來的呢？眞了不得，縣立第三小學的校長，也有十把個人在爭奪，內有大學生，有法政生，中學生，師範生，但是，介紹的都是耍人，終之，是××委員介紹的那一個得手了，但是，敎員呢？校長差不多沒有權了。」</p>
<p>我的腦袋昏沉着的我的謀職的希望已無踪無影地消失了。這樣徬徨地，在一羣然急的人們里混了許久，我方離開了台城，離開了余老板，又向着我的新的旅　上去了。</p>

<p>住在礜叻吧這個小地方的一夥人，是專門給人開拓吧山。他們除了勇敢地用着牛樣的蠻氣力開拓荊棘叢生的吧山之外，放佛沒有其他的生活本領與技能。</p>
<p>這些人的家放佛沒有固定似的。有時，人們來雇他們去開吧，於是，那極簡單的家也就跟着搬去了；開拓了幾里路，家就向前地遷徙了一回，好像古時的遊牧時代的過着逐水草而居的生活，自然，家庭裏的小孩子，和雞狗之類的一些家畜，也跟着前進，年紀較大一點的孩子，天一亮就和他們的父親或哥哥到前方去，搬運樹幹枯枝回到家裏來做燒飯和架房子的薪料。</p>
<p>遠遠地望見一片迷濛濃厚的黑烟，和舌頭似得殷紅的火焰，一團團的冒着，直聳到雲霄裏去，熱烈的火焰在蓬亂的叢林間燒着，蔓延的燒着，發出嗶嗶拍拍的聲響，交雜着斧斤的噹噹叮叮的清脆的伐木聲。女人們和小孩子們瞭望到這種黑烟和聽到這種聲音，就知道渠們的丈夫或者是父親哥哥在謀渠們的衣食，用着蠻氣力與剛毅果敢的勇氣，給人們開拓吧山了。</p>
<p>開拓吧山，原是一樁極艱難危險事情，所開拓的土地，不消說是偏僻不毛的，因此，他們的日用品與糧食，得預先從外面運進來，在吧山裏，時時因為飲水的不清潔，而害起肚脹病來，不能起來再做工作，靜靜地停止呼吸去了。</p>
<p>同時，還有二種使人覺得更可怕的，一稱是瘴氣，另一種却是毒蛇，開吧人碰見這兩種東西，就好像在黑漆漆的夜裏碰見鬼一樣的可怕，覺得眼前的生命離天國已是不遠了！可是，瘴氣並不是每個荒蕪的吧山都能碰到的，至於毒蛇，則時時有可能和肉腿光顧的危險。癩頭小二的祖父，爸爸就全都死在毒蛇的口裏，整個的　叻吧的人們都知道這事情，而且很清楚的明白開拓吧山是一件極危險的工作，可是，他們這一夥人除了用蠻氣力以生命來博取生活之外，又是什麽其他的生活本領呢！</p>
<p>有一天的午後，女人們和小孩子們正在簡陋的亞答屋前徜徉，瞭望着一團團的黑烟和殷紅的火焰從前面的林子裏冒起來，袅袅地浮蕩到天空裏，把半邊的天空也都燒紅了，陡然間，一陣鑼鼓聲急促的敲着，雜着一片嘈雜的人聲，這聲音溜進他們的耳朵裏，心，不由得卜卜的跳動起來，她們心里明白，他們又碰到了危險的事情了。（這是拓吧山的人的一種習慣，當他們在吧山裏碰到毒蛇的時候，他們就急促地敲着布鼓銅鑼，似乎敲鑼鼓可以抵抗毒蛇的進攻）？</p>
<p>後面的女人們懷着一顆跳動的心，跑到荒蕪的吧林裏去，鑽進人堆裏，問着：「是誰呀，誰給毒蛇咬着呢」？楞住眼珠子，短髮蓬亂地在額頭前飄著。</p>
<p>「癩頭小二，還，……一共三個人」。人叢中傳出來的聲音，低沉的，悲傷的。</p>
<p>「怎麼，可厲害嗎」？又有人很關切地問。</p>
<p>「唉，可憐極了，三代全都死在毒蛇的口裏！圍觀的女人們搖蕩着腦袋嘆氣，瞧著癩頭小二的媽發瘋似的，蓬着頭髮眼淚滿面抱着癩頭小二的屍體哭着，嚷着！</p>
<p>等到屍體一開吧山之後，這一幕悲劇，仿佛烟樣的消散了，拓吧人又繼續地做着他們未完了的工作，樹林間依然冒着團團濃烈的黑烟和殷紅的血焰，各處都響着拍拍的燒木聲，與噹噹叮叮的斧斤的聲音。</p>

<p>Beiping: Song Zheyuan hosted a banquet tonight at the Diplomatic Building for all members of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, as well as heads of military and political organs, and leaders from all sectors.

Tada, the Japanese military commander in Tianjin, made some representations to our authorities when he came to Beiping a few days ago. Tada and Doihara are currently negotiating these two issues in Tianjin. Although the puppet troops are still engaged in minor actions in the Chahar-North incident, a resolution may be easier because both China and Japan share the intention of not escalating the situation. As for the Hebei-East issue, the Japanese side's attitude is still in a period of hesitation. The extent to which they will concede in the future is still uncertain. It is reported that our authorities have decided to engage with the Japanese side sincerely, in order to fully secure the administrative power of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council.

<p>Tianjin: Zhangjiakou News, On the morning and evening of the 21st, three Japanese aircraft flew over Guyuan and Zhangbei twice, circling for a long time for reconnaissance before leaving.

<p>Tianjin: Doihara and Nagami plan to go to Beiping again on the 23rd.

The puppet regime insists that the six counties outside the Chahar Great Wall, Guyuan, Shangdu, Kangbao, Zhangbei, Baochang, and Wanquan, must be劃入 into the territory of Rehe or the Mongolian Autonomous Region and be garrisoned by the Mongolian Security Force under the command of Zhuoshhai. Therefore, negotiations are particularly difficult. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Recent Developments in Customs Revenue <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: According to the Customs Administration, customs revenue in the past year has been affected by the decline in the world economy, the lack of recovery in domestic rural areas, the decline in industry and commerce, and the lack of trade. On the one hand, the promotion of domestic goods has reduced the import of foreign goods. The Ministry of Finance estimates that the customs revenue for the 23rd year will increase by 12 million yuan compared with the actual revenue in the 22nd year. Among them, both import and export taxes have increased, while transshipment taxes have decreased slightly. The reason is that the import tariff implemented in July of the 23rd year aims to protect the domestic product tax rate. There are more increases and fewer decreases. Therefore, import taxes have still increased. As for the new export tax rate implemented in June of the 23rd year, most of them have been reduced compared to before, but tax revenue has still increased slightly. The decrease in transshipment tax is mainly due to the abolition of the transshipment tax on postal packages and the exemption of industrial products. However, since the beginning of this year, the import of goods from outside Shanhaiguan has been less, and domestic purchases are weak. In addition, the special circumstances in North China have greatly reduced import tariffs. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e22">New Trends in Anglo-American Relations <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Since the North China issue has become serious and the naval conference has opened, relations between Britain and the United States have shown a new trend. On the 5th of this month, the British Foreign Secretary and the US Secretary of State issued statements at the same time, one expressing concern about the North China issue and recognizing that interference in China's internal affairs is unfortunate, and the other expressing that the powers have a collective obligation on the China issue and must strictly abide by the Nine-Power Treaty. At the naval conference, Britain showed concessions on its long-standing advocacy of medium-sized warships and accepted the US's large-sized principle, willing to limit the maximum tonnage to 32,000 tons. This issue was the center of the dispute between Britain and the United States on naval issues. Britain's willingness to concede must have its own intentions. Recently, a member of the British House of Lords even suggested that Britain and the United States conclude a naval defense treaty. Although this proposal is idealistic, it can also be seen that this is the general trend of British opinion.</p>
<p>According to this ideal, Britain should open its important naval ports, such as Singapore, to the United States so that the US fleet can use British military ports. The United States should also open US military ports, docks, and fuel stations to Britain. In this way, any country can be prevented from carrying out aggression in the ocean. The basis of this ideal is the recent agreement signed by Britain and France, that is, France allows British ships to use French military ports when the British fleet is attacked. If this proposal is applied to a corner of the Far East, it may be possible to realize it. If it is generally applicable, it is not allowed by the facts. In the Far East, the interests of Britain and the United States are consistent. Britain lacks a fleet, while the United States lacks military ports. It is said that once the United States is in trouble in the Far East, if Britain does not allow it to borrow Hong Kong, the power of the US fleet will be greatly reduced. The mutual opening of naval ports is to enhance the power to deter aggression and to properly guard the western coast of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Although the extent to which Anglo-American cooperation has materialized is unknown to us, there are still many political issues to be resolved before negotiating this kind of military cooperation method. The situation in the Far East has reached the point where Britain has no ability to resist Japan alone and has no possibility of compromising with Japan. The only way is to ally with the United States to defend itself. It is very obvious that the United States wants to maintain its open-door policy and keep the Philippine Islands safe, and it also needs the help of Britain. However, the United States is a democratic country, and the president has no power to sign secret treaties, and the president's promises are often rejected by Congress. It is really difficult for Britain to rely on the United States for help. The guarantee of the State Council is not completely reliable. Moreover, the current Neutrality Act still prevents the president from signing a military alliance with any country. This is an obstacle on the American side. Britain has always adopted pragmatism in the Far East, and allying with Japan and the United States is always based on convenience. Simon's failure to accept Stimson's proposal after the September 18th Incident has made those in the United States who advocate cooperation feel chilled. If this attitude does not change, the United States will not be willing to cooperate. This is the gap on the British side. Although Britain and the United States have reached a point in the Far East where they will both lose if they are divided and both benefit if they are united, it is believed that the politicians of the two countries will be able to work hard to break this obstacle and actively cooperate.</p>

<p>Moscow. A detailed report was received from Kulun today stating that Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops looted in Bulun Tesen. After looting, they returned to Manchuria, burning down the entire派出所building before leaving and taking away supplies, food, and furniture. According to the report, Deputy Director of the派出所Soso Bai and four soldiers were killed by the Japanese, and several soldiers were taken captive to Manchuria. The Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops numbered about 300, with ten large trucks, each equipped with one or two heavy machine guns, and a passenger car carrying a Japanese officer and two White Russians. (21st TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow. According to a report from Blagoveshchensk, reliable information was recently obtained from Changchun, revealing the truth about the recent looting by Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops on the border of the Mongolian People's Republic. After the breakdown of the Japanese-Manchukuo-Mongolian negotiations, the Kwantung Army requested Tokyo to allow them to loot several places on the Mongolian border, even deep into the interior. However, before Tokyo could respond, the Kwantung Army, impatient, took responsibility for launching the operation themselves. A few days ago, Changchun received a statement from a Japanese military attache, saying that if the Kwantung Army remained still after the breakdown of the negotiations, Mongolia and the Soviet Union would think that Japan was showing weakness, or that the Mongolian People's Republic had won in the negotiations. Therefore, the attache believed that Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops should immediately invade the Mongolian border, in order to threaten them during the negotiations if their requests to recognize "Manchukuo" and exchange diplomatic envoys were not met. He also proposed a detailed plan to continuously loot various Mongolian border areas and insisted on taking away or even killing Mongolian soldiers. He insisted on this position, threatening the Kwantung Army headquarters with the idea that Japan would lose its prestige with the Soviet Union. He even suggested that Mongolia should not be allowed a moment of peace, even if it led to a Japanese-Soviet war. This statement made a strong impression on the Kwantung Army headquarters, which then decided to begin the looting operation without waiting for Tokyo's approval. The remaining parts of the plan are still being discussed in Changchun. (22nd TASS Dispatch)</p>

<p>Phoenix, USA. The speech made by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman in Las Vegas a few days ago regarding Japan has attracted national attention. Today, Pittman reiterated his words, saying, "I do not want others to think that I intend to incite war, because I really want to prevent Japan from inciting war against the United States, and the situation is pressing, so I have to speak frankly. Japan also knows that if it wants to compete for hegemony in the Pacific, it must do so through naval warfare. Today, only the United Kingdom and the United States have sufficient fleets in the world to blockade Japan. If the political elements currently in power in Japan continue to govern, then the blockade may be unavoidable. I will say this in the Senate. Peace-loving people think that frank discussion is inciting war, but in reality, it is the opposite, because preparation is to prevent war." Pittman also said that the League of Nations can never maintain world peace. "Since the United States has a responsibility to protect the people's territory, it must recognize this responsibility. If Japan does not encounter setbacks, it will continue to expand its territory and influence. What is there to hide, as evidenced by recent facts? Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States may soon hold naval exercises in the Pacific to slightly curb its ambitions for conquest and expansion." (21st National News Dispatch)</p>

<p>Security and Armaments Equality: Difficult Compromise as Britain, US, and Japan Argue</p>
<p>London: Following the adjournment of the Naval Conference, Norman Davis, the chief representative of the United States, and Admiral Standley, the Chief of Naval Operations, visited the Japanese representatives at Grosvenor House at 5:30 PM today. The talks lasted only half an hour and did not involve lengthy discussions about the future development of the Naval Conference. Davis is scheduled to travel to Switzerland with Mrs. Philips, the Under Secretary of State, on Monday to spend Christmas and will return here in early January to participate in the Naval Conference. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>London: The Japanese delegation released a statement on the 21st regarding the progress of the disarmament conference to date and Japan's position, stating: "The conference is proceeding as initially planned, and there have been ample opportunities to explain Japan's position. We are very satisfied that the common upper limit has been fully explored. Generally speaking, Japan's position is based on three points: 1. Establishing equal rights in armaments; 2. Ensuring that the common upper limit is set at the lowest possible level to achieve actual disarmament; 3. Abolishing or drastically reducing offensive weapons and establishing the principle of making defense easy and offense difficult, thereby avoiding threats and aggression. To date, the relationship between security equality and armaments equality has been the subject of debate. Although Britain has raised the issue of vulnerability, naval forces are highly mobile and can concentrate forces quickly. The voyage of the Baltic Fleet to the Far East and other examples are numerous. Tactically, a force of three cannot compete with a force of five. Determining quality without determining quantity benefits the UK and US, which have large quantities, but is extremely unfavorable to Japan. The British proposal only discusses principles and is not fully clear. However, its key point is that the military strength required by each country varies depending on the size of its responsibilities, which is fundamentally different from Japan's position. Therefore, Japan has reiterated that it must return to the Japanese proposal. However, a final rejection of the British proposal has not yet been expressed, but Britain should also understand that it is difficult for Japan to accept." (Dentsu News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: The Standard Evening News recently commented on Japan's demand for a common upper limit on naval forces, saying, "If this demand is realized, Japan's position in the western Pacific will inevitably become impregnable. If disputes arise with Britain and the United States in that region in the future, they will have to defer to Japan. Japan has vital interests in the Western Pacific, just as we do in the English Channel and the North Sea. This is undeniable. However, due to the constraints of current treaties, Britain and the United States cannot establish naval bases near the Japanese islands in the Pacific. Even if the naval ratio remains the same, Japan's naval power is already more than sufficient to resist attacks. How can it be granted equal rights? This so-called naval equality for Japan is not based on security concerns but is actually necessary for the country's prestige. All demands based on national prestige lead to mutual suspicion and jealousy, creating a general sense of insecurity, and the danger of war breaking out is also worrisome. Therefore, the Naval Conference should focus on the mutual security of all countries concerned, which would be beneficial in practice." (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>London: The Spectator Weekly recently commented on the Naval Conference, saying, "If the 'quantitative restriction' proposal put forward by Naval Minister Lord Monsell on behalf of the British government yesterday can be implemented, the unrestricted naval competition among countries can at least be prevented in the near future, and there can be a slight respite. Even if various agreements are unlikely to be reached at present, it is still possible to sign them in the future. As for the idea that each naval power should notify each other of future shipbuilding programs, the United States still believes that the original rationale has not been fully exhausted and that separate provisions can be formally agreed upon. However, this program may be slightly modified within certain limits. If the Naval Conference can achieve this, and limit the tonnage and gun caliber of various warships, it would be a truly worthwhile endeavor." (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Northern Counteroffensive Successful: Morale of Abyssinian Army Greatly Boosted <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>News of the Recapture of Magale Still Awaits Verification: Italian Aircraft Drop Incendiary Bombs, Destroying Abyssinian Army Camps</p>
<p>London: According to the Abyssinian capital's gazette, after the Abyssinian army's victory in attacking the Italian army north of the Tekeze River on December 15th, morale has been greatly boosted, and continued progress has been made on the northern front. In the battle on December 15th, thousands of Eritrean soldiers surrendered to the Abyssinian army. The Abyssinian army also captured ten tanks, many cannons, and countless bullets. News from the Abyssinian capital claims that the Abyssinian army has recaptured Magale, but the authorities are quite skeptical of this claim. According to unofficial sources, Abyssinian outposts have not yet been able to make contact with the "defeated" Italian army. At the same time, according to Italian sources in Asmara, Italian aircraft today used incendiary bombs to bomb the Abyssinian army between Coran and Lake Ashangi, south of Magale, and many camps were hit and caught fire. A squadron of Italian aircraft repeatedly bombed 3,000 Abyssinian soldiers, causing many casualties. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to a communiqué recently released by the Abyssinian government, as a result of fierce fighting between the Abyssinian and Italian armies on the northern front, ten tanks, twenty-eight machine guns, and two trucks were seized. Both sides suffered hundreds of casualties. Currently, the Abyssinian army is advancing towards the holy city of Aksum. The Italian army's right wing, under heavy attack from the Abyssinian army, has retreated to Donbegina and Medifanit. According to the latest news, the Abyssinian army has cut off transportation between Donbegina and Aksum and captured seven Italian soldiers, indicating that the Italian army is now using white soldiers to assist native soldiers in combat, no longer relying solely on black soldiers as it did at the beginning of the war. Well-informed sources believe that the Italian army is about to launch a large-scale counteroffensive. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Our special correspondent, O'Chana, reports that since the Abyssinian army made contact with the Italian army in the Shire region on the northern front starting on the 15th of this month, the fighting has now temporarily ceased. This is because the Abyssinian army's progress has brought them close to the defensive line set up by the Italian army south of the holy city of Aksum, and rather than venturing deep into enemy territory and courting danger, they have chosen to halt their advance. It is said that the initial fierce fighting took place near Daga Hamus, followed by close-quarters combat and hand-to-hand fighting. Although the Italian side had air power, they were unable to assist their troops for fear of harming their own forces. As a result of the fierce battle, the Abyssinian army finally occupied Daga Hamus. The Italian army retreated once to Antala Selassie, and then retreated from there to the defensive line south of the holy city of Aksum. The Abyssinian army then stopped its pursuit. In addition, the fighting on the western front of the Tigray front is also extremely fierce, the most intense since the start of the war. However, the southern front in the Ogaden region is calm.

<p>Dolo: The Abyssinian troops of General Nasibu of the southern front are concentrating here, preparing for a general offensive.

<p>Dire Dawa, Abyssinia: According to a telegram from our war correspondent, La Foya, the Abyssinian army on the southern front in the Ogaden region is continuing to prepare for large-scale military operations. The Abyssinian troops are being deployed to the south in batches. Although the number of people in each batch is not large, the number of teams sent out successively is considerable. The strength of the southern resistance line will soon be greatly supplemented, often reaching thousands of troops, and they are all hidden in various locations, making it difficult for enemy aircraft to detect them.

<p>Saving on Consumption, Concentrating Cash Reserves: Also Claims Victory is Assured in the East African War</p>
<p>Rome: According to our correspondent, Italian officials are confident that the country will be able to cope with the "sanctions front" formed by the 50 member states of the League of Nations, and that victory is assured in the war being waged in East Africa. The reasons are as follows: 1. The failure of the peace plan proposed by Britain and France, allegedly due to the strong speech delivered by Prime Minister Mussolini in Pontinia, is seen in Italy as not being Italy's responsibility since the Prime Minister delivered his speech before the resignation of the British Foreign Secretary Hoare, but at the time Hoare had already decided to retire. 2. Italy's economic strength is sufficient to cope with all difficulties, and the national consumption is lower than in any other European country. Since the government recently ordered the implementation of various austerity measures, consumption has further decreased. Based on the production capacity of various industrial organizations, it is expected that Italy will be able to achieve self-sufficiency in the near future. 3. Italy's financial cash reserves are sufficient to support the entire national economic organization. The government's current gold and foreign currency reserves, including those stored abroad, total 8 billion lira. In addition, the gold collection movement launched domestically is expected to raise another 1 billion lira. 4. Politically and diplomatically, Italy believes that the "sanctions front" formed by various countries will be difficult to sustain. France's attitude has become less firm than Britain's. In addition, several non-League of Nations members, such as Germany and Japan, are expected to support Italy. 5. Recent British comments about the country's naval strength have made an impression on the Italian government, leading to a strong belief in the country's own naval and military strength.

<p>Future Will Be Controlled by US Policy: Believe Chinese Currency May Join Hands with the US Dollar</p>
<p>London: Financial figures here are concerned about recent fluctuations in the silver market and the lower price offered by the United States for silver purchases. It is said that for two years, the US policy of raising silver prices has disrupted the economic organization of countries in the Far East. China protested to the United States last October, but to no avail, and had to impose heavy export taxes to prevent the outflow of silver. The Chinese government recently had no choice but to suspend the circulation of silver. This measure immediately aroused protests from Japan, and the so-called autonomy movement in North China followed. The purpose of Japan's protests was to prevent the silver in North China from being extracted by the central government. It is reported that the Chinese government proposed to the United States that it was willing to sell part of its 400 million ounces of silver reserves to the United States in exchange for US dollars or gold. This proposal was not accepted by the US government. When news spread on the 7th of this month that the US Treasury Department had not actually purchased silver in London, the silver market was panicked. In the following days, purchases were completely suspended, and it was announced that silver would no longer be purchased exclusively in London, but would be obtained from other markets. At the same time, it was learned here that China and the United States were negotiating in Shanghai to exchange Chinese silver reserves for US dollars or foreign currency. People generally believe that Chinese currency may join the US dollar group in the future, or indirectly link with gold or the gold standard. Financial circles in London also believe that the international monetary situation will be controlled by US policy in the future, and that the United States therefore bears a serious responsibility: to determine when to consider general measures for international monetary stabilization, as international economic recovery is mainly dependent on monetary stability.

<p>New York: Handy &amp; Harman did not publish silver prices today. The London silver market will also temporarily suspend trading every Saturday because the United States has announced that it will only trade for half a day on Saturdays, and the time is too short, so silver purchases will be suspended every Saturday. (Guomin News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The London silver bullion market has been falling for days. Japanese sources observe the following:</p>
<p>Although there are different views on the extent of the decline in silver bullion prices, if the Chinese government maintains the exchange rate with the British pound at one shilling and two and a half pence, the cost of transportation and interest from Shanghai to London would total one percent. If it is sold in the London market, a refining fee of three percent must be added, which is equivalent to 17.75 pence in the London market. As a result, the price is low, and if the price is even lower, silver will flow back to China. (Dentsu Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e84">Establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Xiao and Qin Visit Doihara to Exchange Views: The Nature of the Chahar Issue is Extremely Serious</p>
<p>Northern Communication, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council was announced on the 18th. In addition to Zhou Zuomin in Shanghai, Wang Kemin, Cheng Ke sick, and Jia Deyao who did not take office, a total of 13 people attended the inauguration ceremony. The time of the grand ceremony was 8:00 am, and the notification was received late on the 17th, so only more than 80 people attended the ceremony. Security was extremely tight inside and outside the Foreign Affairs Building, and special personnel were responsible for taking care of the guests and Chinese and foreign journalists, in order to prevent radical elements from taking any action. The Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council was originally scheduled to be established on the 16th, but was temporarily shelved due to circumstances. It was then contacted on the evening of the 17th, and it was decided to establish it on the 18th. Because the Japanese side has never abandoned its original position, there are two reasons why it was finally able to concede: 1. During the Naval Disarmament Conference, the Japanese side was fully engaged in dealing with the conference, so it temporarily relaxed its grip on North China. 2. The overall adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations has already begun. Japanese soldiers close to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs are holding strong opinions. After the establishment of the council, the most important task at hand is how to deal with the "Hebei East" and "Chahar North" issues, which is also the touchstone of the council's credibility with the people of the country. Therefore, after the completion of the inauguration ceremony, Chairman Song Zheyuan immediately sent Xiao Zhenying and Qin Dechun to the Fusan Hall to meet with Doihara Kenji, the head of the Japanese Kwantung Army's special agency, to discuss the matter. At that time, because the Chahar North issue was close to being resolved, only the solution of the Hebei East issue was discussed, and a long conversation of two hours was held. Xiao and Qin then returned to Wu Yiku Hutong to visit Song and report. Xiao Zhenying also decided to go to Tianjin on the morning of the 19th to take up the post of mayor of Tianjin.</p>
<p>The future disposition of the "Hebei East" puppet organization, according to indirect sources, is divided into three steps: 1. Yin Rugeng voluntarily abolishes the puppet organization. 2. The authorities here will speak to the government on behalf of Yin to ask for leniency. 3. Handle the aftermath. As far as the current situation is concerned, these three items can only be described as a proposal on our side. The Japanese side's expression, as of now, is only within the four words "can be considered". Therefore, the authorities here are prepared to continue contact in the short term, but it is heard that Doihara has left Ping for Tianjin today (20th) and will return to Shenyang within a few days. The military attache of the Japanese Embassy in Peiping, Imai, only arrived in Ping today (20th) to take over. When will the talks be resumed? It will be necessary to consult the Japanese side's opinion in advance before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, the outline has not yet been announced, but it is credible that in addition to the committee electing three standing committee members to be responsible for handling daily affairs, there will be three departments: Secretariat, Political Affairs, and Finance, which will carry out council affairs under the orders of the standing committee. When necessary, a number of specialized committees may be established. It is heard that in the near future, there will be three specialized committees: Foreign Affairs, Transportation, and Culture. These committees are research and design agencies, so they will recruit various specialized technicians to take on the responsibilities. As for the candidates for the heads of the three departments: Secretariat, Political Affairs, and Finance, the council decided at its second meeting this morning (20th) to appoint Ge Dingyuan as acting head of the Secretariat, Pan Yugui as acting head of the Political Affairs Department, and Guo Zhihan as acting head of the Finance Department, pending a clear order from the central government before they are formally appointed. The council has already sent a telegram to the central government recommending them.</p>
<p>Regarding the "Chahar North" issue, its seriousness is even greater than the so-called "autonomy movement". Therefore, the authorities' response has been quite painstaking. It is said that the Japanese side demands that the six counties of Guyuan, Bingchang, Kangbao, Zhangbei, Huade, and Shangdu be garrisoned by the Mongolian security forces, and that the administrative power of the six counties be ceded together. The reason is said to be the necessary action to complete its Manchuria-Mongolia policy. The authorities ordered the security forces defending the city to swear to coexist with the city and not to abandon it lightly, while negotiating with the Japanese side, arguing based on reason. Finally, our side expressed that in any case, both sides would make concessions at the same time. During the negotiations, Zhangjiakou frequently telegraphed information about the stalemate on the front line. Until the previous day (18th), it was proven that there was no more war on the front line, and the news also subsided. According to the Japanese side, the Mongolian security forces are organized by the Mongolian Political Affairs Council and led by Zhuo Shihai. The authorities therefore summoned Bao Yueqing, the resident representative of the Mongolian Political Affairs Council in Ping, to inquire about the truth. Bao said that he had not received any telegram from the Mongolian Council regarding this matter, so he could not answer. In order to clarify the truth and avoid misunderstandings among the people, Bao agreed to go to Pangjiang to meet with Prince De. The authorities were very pleased, so Bao left Beiping a few days ago. Tonight (20th), the relevant parties here received a telegram from Bao reporting that he had arrived in Pangjiang. The process of visiting Prince De was not mentioned, only that he would come to Ping in a few days. It is generally speculated that the truth about Chahar North will be clear after Bao arrives in Ping. (December 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Yin Ju-keng Tries Hard to Expand the Pseudo-Eastern Hebei Region <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Extending Occupation to Areas Around Xinhe and Tanggu / Customs and Salt Taxes Have Not Yet Been Intercepted</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Since the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, the issue of the pseudo-Eastern Hebei organization has not yet been resolved. Tanggu, Xinhe, Changping, and Ninghe have all been forcibly occupied by security teams dispatched by the pseudo-organization, who drove out officials of the provincial government. Furthermore, a pseudo-Eastern Hebei Bank was established in Tongzhou to issue banknotes. Judging from these events, the pseudo-Eastern Hebei organization seems determined to maintain its separatist power, making it extremely difficult to seek compromise or its voluntary abolition.</p>
<p>In the defense area of the 32nd Army at Tanghe, the Zhao Lei unit of the 4th Security Brigade of Eastern Hebei arrived within the past week and demanded the handover of barracks, leading to a brief conflict. After a battalion of the 961st Regiment of the 29th Army arrived, the 32nd Army relinquished the barracks, including the Xinhe railway station defense area. On the 18th, the 32nd Army began to concentrate from Bunan towards Shunde and Baoding. As the 29th Army was deploying to Tanggu and Xinhe, with the 653rd Regiment headquarters planning to proceed to Lutai and Ninghe for takeover, Yin Ju-keng again ordered Zhao Lei's unit to maintain vigilance and dig trenches in those two areas, preventing their advance.</p>
<p>Yin, accompanied by his Japanese advisor Ninomiya, secretly came to Tianjin by car and met with the new Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, Toshiyasu Nagami; the Chief of the China Section of the Japanese Army General Staff, Seiichi Kita; and the Head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan, Takeashita Yukiharu. He requested them to negotiate with Song Zheyuan to prevent the 29th Army troops from crossing Junliangcheng. The original defense areas of the 32nd Army in Ninghe, Lutai, Xinhe, and Tanggu were to be handed over to the security teams under the pseudo-organization's rule. Nagami then went to Peiping on the 18th to visit Song Zheyuan regarding this matter.</p>
<p>By the evening of the same day, the troops of the 29th Army that had already arrived in Xinhe and Tanggu were ordered to retreat to Junliangcheng for garrison. Not a single soldier of the regular army remained east of Tanggu. The various agencies in Ninghe had long been forcibly occupied by the pseudo-organization, which also appointed Zhu Yi, the former magistrate of Leting County, as the new magistrate. In Tanggu, the central and provincial government agencies were guarded by security teams, and official documents and funds were forced to be submitted to the Tangshan Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee of Eastern Hebei. Wu Longfu, the Director of the Tanggu Public Security Bureau, was expelled and replaced by Zhu Bo, the deputy commander of the 4th Security Brigade, dispatched by the pseudo-organization.</p>
<p>Currently, the pseudo-region of Yin Ju-keng is gradually expanding, already approaching Tianjin. Tanggu is less than 50 li from Tianjin. If the Hebei-Chahar Political Council is unable to abolish the pseudo-Eastern Hebei organization, Tianjin may also be engulfed, which is a matter of serious concern.</p>
<p>After the pseudo-Eastern Hebei organization intercepted the customs and salt taxes of eastern Luanhe, although the customs duties were not allowed to be remitted to the central government and were temporarily kept by the collecting agencies, in reality, the customs offices did not comply. The pseudo-organization, lacking a proper plan, did not resort to coercive interference. As for the salt taxes, the Changlu Salt Tax Inspection Office has two salt marshes under its jurisdiction, both located within the current pseudo-region: the Lutai marsh and the Fengcai marsh. The Lutai marsh is located on the coast of Lutai Town, while the Fengcai marsh is located in the Tanggu and Hangu area.</p>
<p>Last year, the two marshes collected over 20 million yuan in salt taxes. This year's performance is even better, with over 25 million yuan already collected. In the past, salt taxes were collected and paid by the marshes and agencies to the Tianjin Inspection Office and deposited in the Central Bank. The annual revenue, after repaying foreign debts secured by salt taxes and the interest on the post-Boxer Protocol loan of 1913, was used to subsidize military expenses in North China. Since 1934, due to war zone public debt collateral, an additional 1.5 million yuan has been spent annually.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that there is no need for excessive concern regarding the pseudo-Eastern Hebei organization's interception of customs and salt taxes, as the customs duty interception is difficult to achieve, and there is no salt tax to deduct. If the two marshes are controlled and salt production for external sales is prevented, Lu salt and Huai salt can be transported within the Changlu salt sales area as substitutes. The war zone public debt interest of 1.5 million yuan can be suspended. If Yin relies solely on the revenue from the 22 counties to sustain itself, it may be difficult to maintain for long.

<p>Six University Presidents Send Another Letter to Students Urging Resumption / Song Zheyuan Asks University Presidents to Strictly Manage Students</p>
<p>Peiping dispatch: The patriotic student movement in Peiping has slightly eased today (20th) after persuasion from various parties, but internal activities are still quite active. Here are the situations from various aspects:</p>
<p>Professors from Various Universities Visit Qin</p>
<p>Li Jianxun of Normal University, Yan Shutang of the College of Law and Commerce, and Zhu Jie of the China College visited Mayor Qin Dechun at 10 AM today (20th). After the professors explained their intentions, Qin immediately stated that student strikes and petitions are indeed patriotic movements but are detrimental to public order and should not be expanded. He asked the professors to persuade them, and so on.</p>
<p>Jiang Menglin Elaborates on Solutions</p>
<p>The reporter interviewed Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University, today (20th). According to his remarks: "This student patriotic movement is inherently pure. Students view petitions and marches as a way to arouse public patriotism. Local authorities feel the difficulty of maintaining order. We are willing to peacefully persuade the students to stop off-campus activities as soon as possible. The president's authority can use a peaceful attitude to guide the students to the best of his ability and will never use stricter methods to forcibly stop their actions. The president can give sincere advice to students based on the telegram from the Ministry of Education. If students have opinions on political current events, they can submit them in writing to the president, who will then forward them to the government. However, the president cannot expel students because of their patriotism; I think all parties can understand this. Since the student petition on the 9th, the presidents of the universities have jointly issued a letter to the students, advising them to resume their studies immediately. Today, a second announcement to the students was issued, still advising the students to resume classes immediately, which shows that the presidents have always been responsible for persuading the students."</p>
<p>Students Temporarily Do Not Demonstrate</p>
<p>According to sources on the student side, students from various schools in Peiping will not be passive because of the arrest of students by the military police, nor will they be afraid because of student injuries or deaths. They are now uniting internally, closely contacting students in various provinces and cities, and working together for a unified patriotic movement. They will temporarily not march or demonstrate in the recent few days and will not make sacrifices without any return. However, it does not mean that they will not sacrifice again; they will show their determination when the time is ripe. The authorities of various schools have tried hard to persuade them, and the students are not unreasonable, but this is a patriotic movement of the entire student community, which cannot be answered by one or two individuals or schools. Currently, all national and private universities in Peiping have gone on strike, and municipal and private middle schools have followed suit. The resumption of classes cannot be discussed at this moment. As long as the local authorities restrain the police, do not make things difficult for the students, and, even more so, do not make things difficult for the female students, the student movement can be eased.</p>
<p>Six University Presidents Send Another Letter to Students</p>
<p>The presidents of the six universities in Peiping issued a second letter to the students today (20th), which reads: "Dear students, after the student petition march of Peiping schools on December 9th, we jointly issued a letter to the students, pointing out that "the goals of your petitions and strikes can be said to have been achieved. We hope that you will not create complications, waste time, and resume your studies immediately." Unexpectedly, after that letter was issued, there was a large-scale student march in Peiping on the 16th, with thousands of participants and nearly a hundred injured. We, of course, sympathize with the expression of patriotic sentiments of the young students. However, such mass action has the function of protest, but it is not a practical method of saving the country. You are all in the learning stage. Two protests are enough to awaken the public and inform the world. The actual matter of serving the country definitely cannot be effective with bare hands, shouting slogans, and distributing flyers. Young students, after identifying the goal of serving the country, should strive to train themselves to become knowledgeable and capable talents to meet the needs of the country. If you waste your studies and time, not only will it be of no benefit to serving and saving the country, but it is simply young people abandoning their own responsibilities and destroying the future pillars of the country. Now all the arrested students have been released on bail, and the injured students are gradually recovering. We sincerely hope that you will resume classes immediately. The matter of serving the country is a heavy responsibility and a long road. Young people must not be misled by a momentary impulse and neglect the preparation for serving the country in the future.

<p>Song Zheyuan Writes to University Presidents</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan issued a letter to the presidents of the universities, which reads: "Recently, students from various schools in the city have been confused by rumors, leading to marches and strikes. Despite repeated persuasion and sanctions, classes have not been resumed. If this continues, not only will time be wasted, but it will also affect the local area. As I am responsible for security, how dare I sit idly by? I have previously informed the students of the schools in writing, but there are still things I cannot help but say. The future rise and fall of the nation depend entirely on the young students. The ability of the students to achieve success today depends entirely on the teachers of the schools. Because when students leave home to enter school, it is no different from entrusting their lives to the teachers in the school. On ordinary days, they use rewards and punishments to help them become talents. In an emergency, they should take on hard work and complaints to correct their mistakes. Today's student thinking cannot be guided by the government's painful explanations. Still, using administrative power to suppress and deter not only causes misunderstandings of destroying education but also raises suspicions of stepping into the shoes of others. Because the responsibility and authority for managing students all lie with the president. Even if stricter methods are used to force their actions, they should also be handled by the president according to the academy's regulations. Moreover, the number of students is large, and their qualities are uneven. Some even distribute communist leaflets. Such actions, if in normal times, the teachers in the school would seem to be inappropriate to let go, let alone at this time when the country is in difficulty. I do not mean to say that the presidents do not bear responsibility for the actions of these students. However, in today's situation, things are very difficult. Only by being in the same boat can we help each other. All sectors of politics and academia exchange opinions and are not afraid of details. I humbly take the meaning of the "Spring and Autumn Annals" to prepare for the worthy, and I sincerely hope that the teachers of the schools, together with the government, will take on the hard work and complaints and overcome the difficulties together. Each should adopt strict sanctions and effective methods based on the situation of their own school in order to return to normal as soon as possible, so that I can also fulfill my private desire to value the young people and protect the school. I am very fortunate, very fortunate. Song Zheyuan" (20th)</p>

<h3 id="e88">Talking About Rabies (Also Known as Madness in Dogs) <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Qingsheng</p>
<p>Rabies has a history of two thousand years in our country. There are records of the people chasing rabid dogs in the seventeenth year of Duke Zhao of Lu (566 B.C.). The so-called rabid dogs are the mad dogs of today.</p>
<p>This disease is widespread in our country, occurring in almost every place. Areas where stray dogs gather are even more of a medium for spreading this disease. After a dog becomes infected, if it bites someone and they are not treated quickly, their life is at risk. In addition to humans, other domestic animals such as pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, cats, and even poultry can be infected.</p>
<p>The pathogen of rabies has not yet been isolated and cultured. Even the Negri bodies, which are recognized by most scholars as the pathogen, cannot be definitively identified. The incubation period of the disease varies, with the average shown in the following table:</p>
<p>If the wound is deep, there are many viruses, the virulence is strong, and the distance to the central nervous system is short, then the incubation period is shorter; otherwise, it is longer. Only 20% to 30% of domestic animals that are bitten by rabid dogs develop the disease.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of human rabies cases are transmitted by rabid dogs, and the rest are transmitted by cats, wolves, and other livestock. The mortality rate of people bitten by rabid dogs is 16% to 20%. According to Babes, the mortality rate from being bitten by rabid wolves is 60% to 90%.</p>
<p>Dogs are an important medium for transmitting this disease, and dogs have been companions to humans for thousands of years. Today, in large cities and remote villages, dogs and humans live together. If there is no clear understanding of this disease, the danger is especially great. Therefore, the symptoms of rabies are described in detail below:</p>
<p>Prodromal Stage: The sick dog is depressed, easily irritated, likes to hide in dark places, and does not like to be approached by people. It may also be affectionate to acquaintances but bite at strangers. Its appetite changes, and it craves indigestible substances such as dirt, dry grass, wood chips, and gravel. The wound is strangely itchy, and it often licks it with its tongue or gnaws at it with its teeth. Sometimes it behaves as usual. Excretion of feces and urine is often difficult.</p>
<p>Excitation Stage: The sick dog is restless, and its temperament suddenly becomes ferocious. It aimlessly attacks animals, chairs, tables, spittoons, etc. It likes to roam far from home and does not show any signs of fatigue. When it encounters other dogs, cattle, horses, sheep, or pigs, it fights fiercely without making a sound. It often fears people, but when stimulated or threatened, it also attacks them. During this period, there are often symptoms of nerve paralysis. The most important symptom is the change in sound, which is rough, loud, and long, different from that of a normal dog. Experienced people can tell that it is infected with rabies simply by hearing it. In addition, appetite disappears, and even drinking water is difficult.</p>
<p>Paralytic Stage: During this period, the paralytic state is more obvious. The mouth is often open, the tongue is hanging down, saliva is flowing out of the mouth, the upper eyelid is drooping, there is strabismus, the cornea is dark and dull, and the pupils are dilated. Paralysis of the limbs is first discovered in the hind legs, and walking is unstable. Soon, the rear part is completely paralyzed and lies on the ground. Paralysis progresses rapidly to the front part of the body. At this time, the sick dog is extremely emaciated and exhausted, and it soon dies. Before death, there are often convulsions. When cats are infected with this disease, their symptoms are the same as those of dogs.</p>
<p>The course of the disease is usually four to seven days, but it can be as short as three days or as long as two or three weeks. Rabies is an incurable disease, and self-healing is extremely rare. After a rabid dog bites someone, it is advisable to try to capture or kill the dog (but do not completely destroy the brain, because the hippocampus of the brain is often used to examine for Negri bodies) and send it to a hospital or health agency for examination to determine whether it has rabies. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the bitten person should undergo Pasteur's treatment. If there is no treatment equipment, the wound should be bled profusely and washed with disinfectant water, such as pure alcohol, 3% carbolic acid, or 1% mercuric chloride, to eliminate the virus. In short, the earlier the treatment after being bitten by a rabid dog, the more hope there is. After a few hours or a few days, there is no certainty. Once symptoms appear, it is too late to save the person. As for the miraculous or secret formulas for treating rabies that are occasionally published in newspapers, after reading them carefully, they are laughable. They do not conform to scientific principles and have no experimental proof, misleading people.</p>
<p>Nowadays, foreign cities are extremely cautious in preventing rabies and have strict regulations to crack down on stray dogs and dog owners. In contrast, in the urban areas of our country, stray dogs are everywhere, and there are frequent reports of rabid dogs biting people. Although there are no accurate statistics on the loss of life, given the large population and the large number of stray dogs, the number is probably not small.</p>
<p>Rabies preventive vaccines have been studied by scholars in various countries for decades and have achieved considerable results. The Central Epidemic Prevention Office in Peiping, our country, also manufactures rabies vaccines. Each 7cc dose costs 2 yuan and is enough to inject one dog. The immunity period is one year.</p>

<p>On the 20th, they held a march and demonstration. However, students in Wuchang were unable to cross the river to Hankou for the march because the ferry service was suspended on that day. Feeling dissatisfied, a portion of the students camped out overnight under the Yellow Crane Tower at the Hanyangmen Wharf. Another portion of students stood vigil in front of the Provincial Government, petitioning overnight. By 2:00 AM on the 21st, students gathered in increasing numbers along Pingyue Road and Changjie, claiming that they would not stop until they achieved their goal of crossing the river. The residents near the Provincial Government and Hanyangmen felt that this action by the students was purely driven by patriotism and could not bear to stand by. As a result, all stores and households opened their doors all night, automatically providing tea and water. The Cao Xiangtai rice store even purchased a large batch of biscuits to comfort them. This shows that popular sentiment is aroused, and the desire to save the country and survive is a common feeling.</p>
<p>While the students were petitioning the Provincial Government, another group of more than 500 people was sent to the upper and lower wharves of Xujiapeng. A group was stationed at Pinghumen, and they all contacted the students at Hanyangmen, waiting for the ferry to start. However, the ferry was ordered to sail elsewhere, and no boats were available. They then negotiated with the Construction Department again and contacted the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau in Xujiapeng to dispatch transportation, but both were unsuccessful. Even the boatmen feared interference from the military police and avoided them as much as possible. Therefore, traffic in Wuhan was completely cut off on the 21st. The students who stayed at the Provincial Government waited until 3:00 PM, when Acting Chairman Lu Zhu and Education Director Cheng Qibao received student representatives. The representatives made three requests:</p>
<p>1. Request that the Central Government be notified and declare the true relationship and establishment process of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to the Central Government.</p>
<p>2. Request that the Central Government be notified, protect the patriotic student movement in Peiping, punish the military and police perpetrators, and release the arrested students.</p>
<p>3. Request that the Provincial Government protect the Wuhan student movement and order the Construction Department to restore the Wuhan ferry service so that they can cross the river for the march.</p>
<p>Lu Zhu replied that the first two points would be forwarded to the Central Government, and the third point of protecting the students was also not a problem, but the restoration of the ferry service would have to be requested from the Pacification Headquarters. It was rumored that Chen Shi, the president of China University, mediated the matter and agreed to allow the students to cross the river in batches for the march on the 22nd and 23rd. The student representatives were responsible for strictly observing discipline to avoid affecting public order. The students considered the result satisfactory and returned to school in formation.</p>
<p>When students in Hankou initially heard that students in Wuchang were blocked and camped out by the river, to help in aid, at noon on the 21st, they continued to gather in Yiyuan for a large-scale march. It is estimated that over two thousand people from ten schools, including Municipal No. 1 Boys' High School, Municipal No. 1 Girls' High School, Xinmian Girls' High School, Yixun Girls' High School, Peiwen Middle School, Luoyi Girls' High School, Jianghan Middle School, Hanjiang Middle School, Aurora Middle School, and Municipal Vocational School, participated. Ye Diya of the Municipal Vocational School served as the commander-in-chief, and Lai Shenxiong of Municipal No. 1 Boys' High School and Zhou Jueshan of Municipal No. 1 Girls' High School served as the deputy commanders.</p>
<p>As they were about to set off, all the students from four schools in Hanyang, including Hanyang Provincial High School of Technology, Hanyang Girls' Vocational School, Hanyang Middle School, and Yizhi Middle School, crossed the Xiang River to Hankou. All students from the Education College and its attached high school in Wuchang, who were blocked, found civilian boats several miles down from Xujiapeng Wharf to cross the river and participate, increasing their momentum. After the march, they went to the Pacification Commissioner's Office to see He Chengjun and petition. They nominated Commander Ye Diya, Zhou Jueshan, and Lai Zhongxiong, and student representatives Yang Zhuai, Xu Qingfeng, and Wang Shufeng from Hanyang, and Zhu Quanji, a representative from the Education College in Wuchang, and eight representatives from Yizhi Middle School to be received. After He Chengjun met with them, he advised them, and the representatives then left the office and announced the disbandment to the public and returned to school. After the students left the office, He Chengjun immediately convened an emergency meeting of responsible persons from the Provincial Government, including Director Wu Guozhen, to discuss maintaining order. Several ferries operated in Wuhan that night, and traffic gradually returned to normal. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Fujian Province Agricultural Improvement Plan <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Rural Cooperative Association Organizes Farmer Loans / Agricultural and Forestry Improvement General Field Works Very Actively</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: In order to develop agriculture and forestry, the Fujian Provincial Government has established a Rural Cooperative Committee, sending personnel to various counties to organize rural cooperative societies and organize farmer loans. A total of 1.5 million yuan was loaned out in 1934, all provided by the Farmers' Bank of China. 500,000 yuan has already been loaned out in 1935. Currently, the Rural Cooperative Committee, considering that it is cold and the end of the year, and poor farmers generally urgently need money, has specifically borrowed 200,000 yuan from the Farmers' Bank of China, distributed to rural cooperative societies in nearby counties, and loaned to farmers. 180,000 yuan to Minhou, and 10,000 yuan each to Pingtan and Fuqing.</p>
<p>In order to carry out winter national labor service, the Department of Construction has designated 18 counties, including Minhou, Fuding, Shouning, Pingnan, Minqing, Youxi, Anxi, Zhaoan, Changtai, Haicheng, Yunxiao, Dongshan, Ningyang, Huaan, Qingliu, Mingxi, Songxi, and Zhenghe, and the Fujian-Southern Fujian Fuzhou-Xinghua-Quanzhou, Fujian-Northern Fujian Pu-Ou-Yan, and Fujian-Western Fujian Zhang-Long-Ting three-line highways, as afforestation areas. The committee is limited to complete the work by the end of next March and report it to the department. Personnel will be dispatched to inspect and provide guidance. It has also been decided to hold citrus fruit evaluation meetings in Fuzhou and Zhangzhou on the 15th day of the first lunar month to improve quality. As for the establishment of agricultural improvement facilities, an agency has been established, namely the Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Improvement General Field, which is completely government-run, divided into general affairs, forestry, and agriculture three departments, and attached with two agricultural farms in Changle and Zhangpu, two forest fields in Fuzhou and Nanping, a seedling field in Fuzhou, and a tea field in Fuan.</p>
<p>The Changle agricultural farm focuses on rice cultivation and experiments and research on breeding work. The Zhangpu agricultural farm focuses on experiments and research on horticultural crops such as sugarcane, sweet potatoes, citrus, oranges, and bananas. The Fuan tea farm focuses on improving and breeding tea varieties, and researching improved tea-making methods. The Nanping forest field focuses on afforestation and improving seedling varieties, and researching the utilization of wood. The Fuzhou forest field focuses on experiments and research on forest protection, and research on the planting of coastal windbreak and sand fixation forests.</p>
<p>Those currently being organized include the Provincial Agricultural Improvement Association, which is jointly organized by technicians from the Department of Construction responsible for agricultural and forestry undertakings, and teachers from agricultural and forestry schools in the province, divided into four groups: general affairs, research, promotion, and investigation. And designated four types of rice, fruit trees, seedlings, and livestock as the current main agricultural work in the province. Each type has a design committee responsible for its responsibilities. Currently, the heads of each group and the design committee members have been selected, and the association affairs can be started immediately, and the steps are determined to be first investigation, second research, third experiment, and fourth promotion.

<h3 id="e90">Jinan Students: The Situation of Sending Them Back Home; All Middle Schools in Various Counties Also Have Vacations <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: All secondary schools and above in this city have been ordered by the provincial government to start their vacations early and students have been urged to leave the schools. The provincial government has prepared vehicles to send them back to their hometowns. Starting from the 20th, four vehicles were prepared at Jinpu Station, attached to slow trains, specifically for students to ride. On the morning of the 20th, one trip south was made, but because it was early, there were only a hundred or so students, who disembarked along the way in Tai'an, Yanzhou, Qufu, Yi, and Zou counties. In the afternoon, a trip north was made with a larger number of over three hundred students, who disembarked along the way in Pingyuan, Yucheng, and Dezhou. On the Jiaoji Railway, a special train was prepared, with a locomotive dispatched from the armored car unit, pulling several carriages. It departed east at 11:00 AM on the 20th, with over three hundred students disembarking along the way in Qingzhou, Weixian, and Gaomi. In addition, there were those who purchased tickets themselves. It is estimated that around one thousand several hundred students were sent out in one day on the 20th. The order was still good. The remaining students will continue to be transported on the 21st. However, on the morning of the 20th, a Japanese plane flew from Tianjin, circled the city at low altitude. At that time, several hundred students were concentrated at the Jiaoji Railway Station, in the process of boarding the train. All the students immediately shouted slogans, their voices shaking the heavens and the earth, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The Japanese plane then flew away. The Department of Education recently received an order from the provincial government, telegraphing all middle schools and above in all counties of the province, ordering them to start their vacations early. The telegrams were immediately sent to the schools as follows: "To the principals of all schools, by order of the Chairman, all secondary schools and above in the province are to start their vacations early. All students are to return to their hometowns immediately, and await early recall for the start of classes next spring, etc. You are urgently requested to order your principals to follow and implement this immediately, and provide a written reply, as required. (Signed) Department of Education," (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Sights and Sounds on the Journey West <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yuan</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Writings on the Chengdu-Chongqing Road</p>
<p>On the morning of October 15th, the reporter braved the rain and took a long-distance public bus from Chongqing to Chengdu. Accompanying me was Mr. Yuan Wenbin. Beforehand, there was much hesitation about taking the bus. Although the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway has a Highway Bureau, the management of vehicles seems to lack thoroughness. The "Special Express" of the Highway Bureau has no fixed schedule, and private car companies and "wild chicken" cars each solicit passengers. The fares are neither fixed nor is there sufficient safety guarantee. In addition, the eastern section of the Chengdu-Chongqing road is muddy due to continuous autumn rains, and there are frequent warnings of overturned vehicles, adding a layer of worry to us. Finally, we mustered our courage and took the Highway Bureau's public bus westward.</p>
<p>That day, we arrived at the bus station outside Tongyuanmen early in the morning to wait for the bus. When we arrived, the first few rows of seats were already occupied, but there were still very few passengers at the station. The reporter asked the reason, and was told, "These are seats reserved by the wife of a certain chief of staff. The wife and others will be here soon." After negotiation, a seat was finally made available in the front row.</p>
<p>The bus was originally scheduled to depart at 7:00 AM, but it was past 9:00 AM when it officially departed, exceeding the scheduled time by more than two hours. Later, it was learned that various transportation agencies and groups in Sichuan often do not adhere to time for gatherings and banquets. For example, for a banquet, the scheduled time is 9:00 AM or 3:00-4:00 PM, but guests always arrive more than half an hour late. It is said that this is to show the guest's high status, not comparable to those who arrive at the first call. This custom has not changed to this day, and the conservatism of the Sichuan people's lifestyle can be seen from this.</p>
<p>When the bus leaves Chongqing city, it must go through a strict inspection, overturning boxes and overturning baskets. Passengers complained endlessly, but the inspectors at the inspection station did not inspect the luggage of "guests" or "military personnel" much. Because the reporter had a letter of introduction from the Highway Bureau, I was also spared some inspection trouble. Ashamed, ashamed.</p>
<p>About sixty li west of Chongqing is the foot of Lao Yingyan Mountain. The bus must spiral up the mountain from here. The mountain road is entirely man-made, and some places must be chiseled through the mountain. The engineering design is very grand, and the terrain is also very majestic, making it the most magnificent part of Sichuan's highway construction. The bus takes about an hour to spiral from the foot of the mountain to the top. When you reach the top, the highway lines you have traveled when spiraling up the mountain can be seen clearly. The scenery is beautiful, difficult to describe. However, the mountain is high and the ground is low, and looking down is quite frightening.</p>
<p>The area on the top of Lao Yingyan Mountain is quite wide. The bus travels here, winding and twisting, surrounded by lush forests, with scattered villages. When going down the mountain, it must still spiral down, and the dangerous situation is even worse than when going up the mountain. Because the turning points are all cut cliffs, although a few piles of earth, low walls, and huge rocks are placed by the roadside for defense, if the driver is even slightly careless, there is still a risk of overturning. After passing Lao Yingyan, you reach Qingmuguan. The plains are quite vast. I heard that there are hot springs, originating from the same source as the Northern Hot Springs, but they have not been utilized. At half past twelve, the bus passed Bishan County. At that time, the drizzle was still pattering. The road was muddy, but fortunately the driver was experienced and able to overcome the dangers as if walking on flat ground. Everywhere we passed, we saw fields crisscrossing, hills undulating, and crops planted all over the mountain tops and roadsides. The neatness of the fields and the diligence of the farmers are rarely seen in other provinces. It is a pity that Sichuan farmers have been exploited by warlords, bureaucrats, local bullies, and landlords for twenty years, shedding tears and swallowing their voices, and their lives are unbearably difficult. Therefore, they all have a haggard look, their clothes are tattered, and seven or eight out of ten rural houses are built of straw and mud walls. The houses with brick walls and tile roofs are mostly buildings from thirty or forty years ago, and there are signs of collapse. The decline of the rural economy can be seen from this. That night, because the road was muddy, the bus traveled very slowly, and we stayed at the Linchun Inn in Rongchang. Almost the entire night was plagued by bed bugs and mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Rongchang, Longchang and other counties are famous for producing summer cloth in Sichuan. The quality is excellent. Years ago, it was sold in various counties in the province and in Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Hubei, and other provinces. In recent years, due to the sharp decline in rural purchasing power and the influx of foreign goods, the sales of Rongchang summer cloth have plummeted, and those engaged in the business have a difficult time maintaining it. Therefore, they have to lower prices to solicit business, with each foot priced at just over ten cents. However, the entrances of various summer cloth shops are still deserted. Fortunately, the expenses of each store are not very large, so there are very few closures.</p>
<p>The next morning, we departed from Rongchang to Longchang. The wife of a certain military chief of staff on the bus had an opium addiction. Every time the bus stopped at a location for a longer period, she had to look for a place selling "Sichuan medicine" to indulge in opium. It took about one or two hours before she came back slowly, delaying the travel time considerably. The other passengers felt very unhappy. After passing Longchang, the crops on both sides became another sight. The plains and plateaus were mostly planted with sugarcane, which is the famous sugar-producing area of Neijiang, Sichuan. It is said that Neijiang sugarcane can be divided into red and white varieties, and white sugarcane is further divided into rush hair sugarcane and luohan sugarcane. Most sugarcane farmers are poor, and they cultivate the land as tenants. They pay five to nine yuan in rent per 10,000 catties of sugarcane, and they borrow money mostly with sugarcane as collateral. Every 10,000 catties of sugarcane can be used to borrow twenty to thirty yuan. In the future, the loan will be repaid with the price of sugarcane, and the interest ranges from 2.5% to 4-5% per month. If the sugarcane paid is not enough to repay the loan, the sugar factory has the priority to collect the sugarcane in the coming year.</p>
<p>In recent years, the sales of the sugar industry have been sluggish. The export of Sichuan granular sugar reached 27 million catties in the 21st year, but by the 23rd year, it had decreased by more than two-thirds. Domestic sales have also reportedly decreased by one-half. The underlying reasons are: (A) excessive transportation costs and heavy taxes; (B) easy to damage and unclean; (C) unable to compete with foreign sugar. The methods of improvement should start from improving manufacturing methods, reducing taxes and transportation costs, and expanding sales.</p>
<p>Neijiang is a city with an ancient and elegant style. The streets are quite clean, with willows planted on both sides. Compared with Chongqing, it has a different flavor. The customs of the people are simple and honest, and the market transactions have very little clamor and chaos. The buildings are very low, quite similar to Beijing, and it already has the scenery of Chengdu. This place is 500 li from Chongqing and 580 li from Chengdu. It can be said to be the midpoint on the Chengdu-Chongqing road, and it is also the most commercially prosperous, most populous, and most well-equipped place with hotels and restaurants in the counties along the Chengdu-Chongqing road.</p>
<p>After staying in Neijiang for two hours, the bus continued to move forward. Mr. Yuan, who was traveling with us, was very tired because he was not used to the bumping. After passing Neijiang, the road gradually dried up. Asking the local farmers, we learned that it had not rained in the area west of Neijiang for several days, and the climate was cooler and more comfortable, unlike Chongqing, which was shrouded in mist and drizzle all day long. At 3:00 PM, we passed Zizhong, which is also famous for producing sugar. At 5:00 PM, we passed Ziyang. At this time, it was already twilight. Because we had to rush to Jianzhou for the night, the bus continued to move forward. Sichuan porters generally work day and night, so even late at night, there is a constant stream of porters coming and going on the road. These people mostly make a living by portering, carrying goods, mostly local crude products and agricultural products. Others, such as cigarettes, etc., are also quite common. At about 8:00 PM, the bus arrived in Jianzhou and stayed at the Linlongbin Inn. This place is only 180 li from Chengdu.</p>
<p>From Jianzhou to Chengdu, you have to pass through Shijing Temple. After a brief tour of Shijing Temple, we got on the bus. From then on, the bus gradually went uphill, passing through Longquan驿. The mountain is not very high, but it is quite winding. The bus travels through it, winding up and winding down, not as spiral-shaped as Lao Yingyan. It is said that it is thirty li uphill and thirty li downhill. When you reach the top of Longquan驿 Mountain, you can see the city of Chengdu clearly. Looking far away, the plains are vast and boundless. From Chongqing to the foot of Longquan驿 Mountain, the whole way is undulating hills. At this point, it is an endless plain, as if entering another realm, and the mind is refreshed.</p>
<p>On the third day, at about 11:00 AM, the bus arrived in Chengdu. The first thing that caught my eye was the towering new blockhouses, and the particularly eye-catching bandit suppression slogans. The reporter had already seen blockhouses densely distributed when I traveled upstream along the river. However, seven or eight out of ten were built of mud, not very strong, and the work was simple. Blockhouses were also built along the Chengdu-Chongqing road to prevent banditry. The blockhouses built outside Chengdu city are all made of bricks, the construction is strong, and the form is also very magnificent, but the cost is said to be quite high. Mr. Yuan Wenbin said that the blockhouses built in the suburbs of major cities in Jiangxi are also more magnificent than those built in the countryside.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Xiao He's Communist Bandits are Rampant; Guangdong Province Deploys Border Defense; The Second Army Headquarters Moves to Shao to Facilitate Command <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Xiao He's communist bandits have recently fled into Guizhou and Guangxi. One group entered Guizhou and is currently ravaging eastern Guizhou. More than 10,000 communist bandits attacked Zhenyuan on the 7th. The defending 93rd Division, led by Gan Lichu, met them in battle. After a fierce battle all night, Gan's troops decided to consolidate their defense at Zhenxiongguan on the 8th as part of a change in strategy. The communist bandits suffered heavy casualties in Zhenyuan. Currently, Guo Siyuan's troops have reinforced Zhenxiong, and Shangguan Yunxiang's division has also joined the blocking effort. The Guangxi army has moved to Guyi, Yongquan, Longsheng, and Ningyi. Bai Chongxi plans to go to Guilin to command. Because it is rumored that a unit of communist bandits from western Hunan has been discovered in northern Guangxi, the Guilin militia has also been mobilized. At the same time, Beijiang in Guangdong Province, which borders Hunan, is also actively deploying defenses. The various units of the First Army have been ordered to strengthen their defense deployments in their original garrisons and strictly prevent the activities of local communists. Deputy Army Commander Li Zhenqiu departed from Dayu on the 9th to inspect the defenses of various departments along the Jiangxi border and instruct the regimental commanders on bandit suppression. As for the defense of the Xiangbian area, the 4th Division of the Second Army, led by Wu Jianxiong, was dispatched to Lechang, Pingshi, Xingzi, and other places some days ago, choosing strategic locations to guard and ordering his troops to scout for communist bandits' movements at any time. During this winter defense period, anyone entering Guangdong from Xiangbian with suspicious behavior will be interrogated. Only those recognized as legitimate merchants will be allowed to pass through. The Second Army Headquarters was originally located in the provincial capital, but recently, in order to facilitate command, the army headquarters was also moved to Shaoguan. Chen Jitang, commander of the Second Army, personally went to the army headquarters on the 7th to give a speech to the officers, encouraging his subordinates to be public-spirited, abide by the law, cooperate with the people, and maintain local security. The army headquarters' staff, adjutant, military supplies, ordnance, military medical departments, and directly subordinate units, engineering battalion, special service company, machine gun company, communications platoon, etc., began to relocate to Shaoguan in batches from the 9th. The directly subordinate units and baggage went first, and the chief of staff led the members to depart, arriving in Shaoguan that evening. The army headquarters was located in the Guangzhou Guild Hall in Shaocheng, and it opened for business as usual the next day. Zhang Da, deputy commander of the Second Army, is scheduled to go to Shao on the 14th to convene a meeting of the subordinate division and regimental commanders to discuss the deployment of border defenses.

<p>Dispute Arises from Gun Inspection Case</p>
<p>Wang Mingfu, the director of the Ruose Hospital in this city, recently followed the order of the county government to hand over the gun to Jin Gentang, the head of Xiao Qianjing Township, for registration. After receiving the license, he took the gun back to Ruose Hospital, intending to hand it over to Wang Minfu. Suddenly, three people, including a certain Zhu, stepped forward to inspect it. Township Head Jin first showed them the gun license issued by the county government, but they wanted Township Head Jin to hand over the already marked pistol, so a dispute arose. They overturned the registration counter of the hospital, causing the patients to lose color and flee in panic. In the examination room, Sun Deji was having an intravenous injection. The doctor's hands trembled when he saw the police, and blood flowed profusely, posing a dangerous situation. Later, two officials, Lang Yinong and Yang Jingjiang, were dispatched by the district office and the Public Security Bureau to stop the dispute. They sent all the witnesses to the Public Security Bureau for disposal. It is said that the Ruose Hospital felt aggrieved for being humiliated for no reason as a charitable organization. On the 22nd, they specially presented a petition to the county party headquarters, the county government, and the Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation, and ordering the surrender of the fleeing offender who carried the gun and compensation for the loss.</p>

<p>Students Parade and Distribute Proclamations to the People</p>
<p>More than 500 students from Suzhou High School here on the 22nd were divided into nine teams. The student National Salvation Association organized by the student union was responsible for convening the students. At 10:00 AM, they gathered in the Zhongshan Hall of Wu Miaoguan, and then went to the bustling areas inside and outside the city to publicize. They distributed proclamations to the people and letters to all students in Suzhou along the way. The Public Security Bureau sent plainclothes detectives to protect them and to guard outside the Japanese concession and in front of the Japanese shops on Banmen Avenue to prevent petty thieves from taking the opportunity to make trouble and causing accidents. The local order was very peaceful.</p>

<p>The City Cracks Down on Extortionist Criminals</p>
<p>Liu Wei, a lawyer in Zhouxian Lane in Wuyi City, received a letter from a soldier through a maid at about 8:00 PM on the 18th of this month, instructing her to give it to a stranger. Liu Wei opened it and learned that he was being threatened to extort 300 yuan in silver dollars, to be placed in a nearby trash can covered with vegetable leaves at 10:30 PM on the 20th. If he did not comply, they would use force to set fire and kill people, etc., and an attached bullet. Liu Wei reported it to Si Daoping, the director of the Public Security First Sub-bureau, on the 19th. It was agreed to use grass paper and attach two yuan in foreign currency and write a reply on a piece of paper, wrapped in newspaper, and placed in the manner mentioned in the threatening letter. After the deployment, Director Si, Inspector Chen Rui, and other police officers went to wait at about 9:00 PM on the 20th. Director Si disguised as a rickshaw driver, and Chen Rui disguised as a worker, ambushing nearby. At that time, a soldier was seen taking a paper package from the trash can and putting it in his coat pocket. Director Si and others rushed forward and captured him, taking him to the bureau. It was found that his name was Wang Shaofu, who had served in the security team before. The bureau, considering that such a case had occurred in the city, sent him to the general bureau and transferred him to the county government for trial on the 21st.</p>

<p>Remedial Measures for Investigating Opium Offenders</p>
<p>The Provincial Anti-Opium Association believes that it is often difficult to be accurate in the investigation of opium offenders transferred by the opium addiction rehabilitation centers in various counties to the provincial government. There are often cases where fellow villagers know that someone is addicted to opium, but the investigation finds that they are not addicted. Now that the general inspection is about to be held, the investigation aspect is becoming increasingly important. Special remedial measures are proposed as follows: Anyone who is reported by someone and the responsible Baojia chief proves that they are indeed using opium, or who is reported by their direct relatives, even if the investigation finds that they are not addicted, will also be considered a suspect. They should be ordered to obtain a solid shop guarantee and guarantor, restricting their residence for one year for long-term observation. If it is discovered that they are using opium, they will be severely punished, and the guarantors will be held jointly liable. Those who cannot find a guarantor will be temporarily detained, and released after it is confirmed that they will not use opium. The above measures have been sent to the provincial government for handling.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Two Fires Claim Three Lives</p>
<p>At 9:15 PM on the 21st, Yao Hong, a 69-year-old resident of No. 142, Sibao, Hangzhou City, accidentally caused a fire while drying bedding. The fire spread rapidly. The fire brigade and other fire rescue organizations rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire, but three thatched houses had already been burned down. Yao Hong, due to her old age and frailty, was unable to escape and died in the fire along with her two three- or four-year-old grandsons. The loss was more than 200 yuan. Also, at 1:15 PM on the 22nd, the Xinxin Electric Materials Store at No. 37, Chenghuang Archway, caught fire because the store owner, Wang Xiqiu, accidentally caused a fire while drying it. The fire spread to the plank wall, and the wind caused the fire to blaze fiercely. The fire brigade and others tried their best to rescue it, but five stores, including the Jiji Fresh Meat Store, Xie Runtai Store, Changmao Fruit Store, and Tongxing Sauce Garden, were burned down, with a loss of more than 5,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e93">A Simple Explanation of the Human Body's Structure and Functions <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zongpeng, Professor at Central University</p>
<p>Humans are the most advanced animals, and their structure is extremely complex. It is impossible to describe everything in detail in a short time. I will only discuss the general aspects. The composition of various parts of the human body is based on tiny cells as units. A large number of cells combine to form tissues, tissues form organs, and organs form systems. Each system and organ in the body has its own responsibility, and they cooperate to perform daily life activities. In terms of structure, the human body can be divided into major systems such as muscles, bones, digestion, circulation, nerves, reproduction, excretion, respiration, and endocrine. The structure and function of each system are described below.</p>
<p>(1) Muscular System</p>
<p>The main function of muscles is to control movement and form soft organs in the body. In terms of shape, they can be divided into three types: striated muscle—that is, the muscle that makes up the external shell of the body, attached to the bones to unite the bones, and under the guidance of nerves, to perform conscious movements; smooth muscle—used to make up the internal organs, such as the stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. These organs perform unconscious movements under normal conditions, like a machine that cannot freely stop once it is turned on; cardiac muscle—this kind of muscle has the shape of striated muscle, but its function is like that of smooth muscle. It is used to make up the heart. The inside of the muscles is full of tiny blood vessels to supply nutrients, and there are also nerves to receive external stimuli.</p>
<p>(2) Skeletal System</p>
<p>The skeleton can be divided into two major parts: the trunk and the limbs. The trunk is divided into the head, neck, chest, back, waist, and tail, while the limbs are the hands and feet. The function of the skeleton is to support the posture of the whole body and to protect the internal soft tissues, such as the skull protecting the brain, the vertebrae protecting the spinal cord, the chest and ribs forming the chest cavity to protect the heart and lungs, and the lumbar vertebrae supporting the abdominal cavity to protect the stomach and intestines. In terms of texture, bones can be divided into cartilage and hard bone. Children have more cartilage because it is not yet calcified. The degree of calcification increases with age, and when people are old, the bones are brittle due to the high amount of calcium (commonly known as lime). Therefore, broken bones are not easy to heal in old age.</p>
<p>(3) Digestive System</p>
<p>The path from the mouth to the anus is called the digestive tract, including the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, etc. In addition, there are accessory glands such as the liver and pancreas. At the junction of the small and large intestines, there is a cecum. The main function of this system is to digest food to nourish the body. In addition to vitamins and inorganic salts, food can be roughly divided into three categories: carbohydrates, that is, sugar, starch, and fiber; proteins, such as animal meat and egg whites; and fats, that is, oils.</p>
<p>After food enters the mouth, the saliva secreted in the mouth digests part of the carbohydrates into sugar, because the saliva contains enzymes that digest carbohydrates. Then, the food enters the stomach through the pharynx and esophagus. The gastric juice contains digestive enzymes, called protein enzymes, fat enzymes, and carbohydrate enzymes, to digest the three types of food. Undigested food is transferred to the small intestine, where it is digested by intestinal juice and enzymes secreted by the pancreas. The bile from the liver is also helpful in digestion. Digested food is absorbed by the intestinal wall and enters the blood, and is distributed to various parts of the body through blood circulation. Undigestible residue is excreted from the body through the large intestine, rectum, and anus. It is not clear what the function of the cecum is in the human body, but in lower animals such as rabbits, the cecum contains bacteria, which do participate in some of the work, because a kind of bacteria ferments, which can make food easier to digest.</p>
<p>(4) Circulatory System</p>
<p>The circulatory system includes blood circulation and lymph circulation. The blood circulatory system includes the heart, arteries, veins, and spleen. The spleen is a lymphatic gland that is closely related to red blood cells and hemoglobin. The heart is divided into left and right atria and left and right ventricles. The walls of the ventricles are thicker than those of the atria. The contraction of the ventricles can generate pressure, causing blood to flow into the arteries and be distributed throughout the body. The walls of the arteries are thicker than those of the veins, so they can withstand stronger pressure. The direction of blood flow in the arteries is centrifugal, while the veins are the opposite. The farther the blood vessels are from the heart, the finer the branches. The circulation of blood starts from the left ventricle and enters the arteries, distributing throughout the body, and then enters the right atrium through the veins, turns into the right ventricle, and is input into the lungs. In this way, the turbid blood is exchanged for gas through breathing to make the blood clear, and then input from the lungs into the left atrium and into the left ventricle, and the action of heart contraction makes the blood re-enter the arteries to circulate.</p>
<p>Blood contains tiny blood cells, which can be roughly divided into two types: red and white. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, hence the name, and are rich in the characteristic of absorbing oxygen. White blood cells are generally smaller than red blood cells and have different shapes, and have the characteristic of resisting or eliminating bacteria. In addition, there are platelets. In addition to distributing nutrients and heat, blood also has the characteristic of resisting toxins. Lymphatic vessels run along the blood vessels, and the vessels contain lymph, which is milky white because it contains nutrients. Lymph is actually the main organ for absorbing nutrients, and the nutrients in the blood are derived from lymph.</p>
<p>(5) Nervous System</p>
<p>The nervous system is the only main organ that transmits stimuli and directs movements of the whole body. Physiologically, it can be divided into sensory nerves and motor nerves. In terms of location, it can be divided into the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system is divided into two major parts: the brain and the spinal cord, which are hollow and have fluid. The peripheral nerves are the nerves that emanate from the brain and spinal cord and are distributed around the body to make contact with the outside world. There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves and a number of spinal nerves. Anatomically, the brain of the central nervous system can be divided into the cerebrum, midbrain, cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. Humans are the highest animals, so the cerebrum is particularly developed. Because the skull limits it, it cannot extend outward, but increases the area inward, so there are a number of wrinkles on it. The cerebrum is divided into two parts: the forebrain and the interbrain. The forebrain controls the sensation and voluntary movement of the whole body, understanding, memory, thinking, association, and other noble functions. The first pair of cranial nerves (olfactory nerves) originate from this part. The interbrain is behind the forebrain and is the general meeting place for sensory stimuli of the whole body. It also controls reflex movements. The second pair of cranial nerves (optic nerves) and the third pair of cranial nerves (oculomotor nerves) originate from this part. The midbrain controls vision and hearing, and reflex movements of the body. The fourth pair of cranial nerves (oculomotor nerves) originate from this part. The cerebellum controls the muscle movement of the whole body, regulates the balance of the whole body, and the coordination of muscles. The pons is embedded in the cerebellum, and controls the sensation of facial skin, the sensation of all muscles in the head, taste, and the movement of chewing, and the secretion of sweat glands and salivary glands. The last is the medulla oblongata, which controls reflection and adjustment work. In addition, it controls the movement of internal organs, such as breathing, vomiting, and swallowing. The fifth to twelfth pairs of cranial nerves originate from this part. Behind the medulla oblongata is the spinal cord, which controls the reception of external stimuli and reflex movements of the trunk and limbs. Spinal nerves originate from this. In addition, there are sympathetic nerves, which come from the nerve knots of the spinal nerves and reach the internal organs, controlling the movement of smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. In addition to the nerves mentioned above, there are sensory organs to receive external stimuli, which are transmitted from the peripheral nerves to the central nervous system. The sensory organs will be briefly described below.</p>
<p>Visual organ: The eye controls vision and is spherical. The front of the eye has a transparent cornea, inside which is the anterior chamber, which contains transparent liquid. Behind the chamber is the iris, which has a hole called the pupil. The lens is attached to the back of the pupil. In the human body, the lens is elliptical. Behind the lens is the posterior chamber, which also contains liquid. Light comes from the outside and penetrates the cornea, passes through the liquid in the anterior and posterior chambers, and is projected onto the retina inside to obtain an image. The principle is like that of a camera, so it is not difficult to understand. The retina is composed of optic nerves, which is the most important part of vision. It contains cells that distinguish light and color. Except for the front part, which is covered with the cornea, the outer layer of the eyeball is a cartilaginous body called the sclera, and the inner layer is the retina. Between the sclera and the retina are the choroid and the choroid membrane.</p>
<p>Auditory organ: The ear controls hearing and is divided into four parts: the auricle, the external auditory canal, the middle ear, and the inner ear. Between the middle ear and the external auditory canal is the tympanic membrane. Behind the tympanic membrane are three small bones. Sound waves hit the tympanic membrane and are transmitted into the ear. Between the ear and the oral cavity, there is the Eustachian tube, which connects to the inner ear through two small holes. The structure of the inner ear is extremely complex, with tortuous ducts embedded in the auditory bone. Both inside and outside the ducts have lymphatic fluid. The ducts are divided into three semicircular canals that control balance and the cochlea that has hearing, to which the auditory nerves are attached.</p>
<p>Olfactory organ: The nose controls smell. The walls of the nasal cavity are covered with olfactory nerve cells. The nasal cavity communicates with the oral cavity, so the nose also controls breathing.</p>
<p>Gustatory organ: The tongue controls taste. Its surface has a number of protrusions, which contain taste cells connected to the taste nerves.</p>
<p>Tactile organ: The skin controls touch, so the whole body has this function, but the fingers are the most sensitive. In addition to touch, it also controls cold, heat, pain, etc. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e96">Year-End Settlement Period Approaching <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Banking and Financial Industries Prepare to Pass the Year-End; Loan Committee to Review Loan Applications Today</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the year-end settlement period for the second half of the year for various banks and the overall year-end settlement period for various industries for the 24th year of the Republic are approaching one after another. Various banks and financial institutions are making all preparations. The Loan Committee will meet on the 23rd to review credit loan applications, and the financial industry will meet on the 24th to prepare for the year-end settlement. The banking industry will meet on the 28th to report on association affairs. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Loan Committee to Review Small Loans</p>
<p>Since the Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee implemented credit small loans on August 1st, it has loaned out a total of approximately 400,000 yuan. Now, due to the approaching bank settlement period and industry year-end settlement period, the number of domestic goods manufacturers and companies applying to the committee for loans has surged. Loan amounts range from 500 to 5,000 yuan. The Loan Committee has separately dispatched personnel to complete the investigation. It is approved that a standing committee meeting will be held on the afternoon of the 23rd at 4 PM to review credit small loans. After approval, loans will be issued immediately. The allocation of funds to promote acceptance bills will also be discussed to submit to the ministry for approval.</p>
<p>Banks' Year-End Settlement to Pass Smoothly</p>
<p>The year-end settlement period for the second half of the year for various banks has arrived. The Savings Department started handling interest settlements on the 15th, and the Business Department started on the 20th, which is very busy. In recent days, various banks have extended office hours internally, some even extending to after 12 o'clock. The Bankers Association has scheduled a standing committee meeting for the afternoon of the 28th at 4 PM. In addition to approving new members, it will also report on association affairs and revise industry regulations. As for the stable passage of this year-end by various banks, there are no other concerns. It is heard that from next year, various commercial banks will tighten up to save expenses.</p>
<p>Financial Industry Ready for Year-End Settlement</p>
<p>In addition to scheduling an executive committee meeting for the afternoon of the 24th at 2 PM to prepare for this year's overall year-end settlement matters, the financial industry, in view of the fact that the members' regular meeting on January 2nd falls on the Gregorian calendar holiday, has decided to hold it earlier. The date will also be determined at the executive committee meeting on the 24th. The collection and remittance of funds by various financial institutions has also become more frequent than in the past. As for the request to the Financial Industry Supervisory Committee to transfer the 18 million yuan loan interest case to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications and the National Industrial Bank, no reply has yet been received.</p>
<h3 id="e97">After the Promulgation of the Sino-French-Vietnamese Treaty, Vietnam Imposes Heavy Import Duties on Chinese Silk <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the regular tax and capital tax, a balancing tax is also levied. The silk industry and others petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiations with France.</p>
<p>According to Hua Dong News Agency, the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Industry and the Silk Fabric Industry Associations jointly submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that after the promulgation and implementation of the Sino-French-Vietnamese treaty, Chinese silk sales to Vietnam should enjoy the lowest tax rate according to the attached schedule. However, the Vietnamese customs are creating tax items arbitrarily, arbitrarily assessing prices, and levying heavy taxes, which are heavier than the taxes paid during the period without a treaty. Overseas Chinese merchants are suffering greatly, and the sales of Chinese silk are on the verge of extinction. They urgently petition the association, earnestly requesting a swift and serious negotiation with the French government to cancel any surtaxes other than those stipulated in the commercial treaty, to comply with the original intention of reciprocity, and to help with foreign trade. It is noted that before 1926, the annual sales of Chinese silk imported into Annam reached more than 10 million yuan. Since the establishment of a commercial treaty between our country and Annam during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, Chinese silk enjoyed the most-favored-nation tax rate. Therefore, silk sales to Vietnam were very prosperous at that time. In July 1927, the Sino-Vietnamese commercial treaty expired, and the silk imported by our country had to be treated the same as countries without a treaty for ordinary taxation. Only one type of regular tax was levied. Since then, in addition to the regular tax, a capital tax (similar to our country's business tax) has to be added. Since then, the burden on overseas Chinese has increased, and the sales of Chinese silk have been greatly hit. In 1930, Wang Zhengting, our former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the French envoy Martel, negotiated a special treaty, but due to the relationship between Schedules A and B, the French side delayed approval, and it has been suspended until now for several years. During this period, the export of Chinese silk to Vietnam was almost completely extinct, and the business of overseas Chinese and the export of domestic silk merchants both suffered. On May 4th of this year, the Sino-French-Vietnamese treaty was fortunately announced. When Chinese silk continued to be transported to Vietnam, it was expected that the old foundation would be rebuilt, but suddenly urgent letters were received from the Annam Di'an and Xidi silk fabric industry associations, stating that since the promulgation of the commercial treaty, the Vietnamese customs has not only failed to reduce the import tax rate on Chinese silk, but has increased it compared to the period without a treaty, and has created many names to impose heavy taxes and levies arbitrarily. Taking Chinese silk as an example, only regular tax was levied in the old treaty to show preferential treatment. Later, when there was no treaty, according to the ordinary tax rate, a capital tax had to be added in addition to the regular tax. Now that a new treaty has been established, the capital tax should be abolished immediately to comply with the principle of reciprocity. However, recently, the Vietnamese customs has not only failed to remove the capital tax, but has also added a balancing tax, which is levied at 25% of the assessed value. For example, for every 100 kilograms of crepe-faced light-colored pure silk fabrics imported into Annam, the comparison of the old and new tax rates is as follows: A. Tax rate under the old treaty (regular tax): 1,360 francs. B. Tax rate without a treaty (regular tax): 10,000 francs; capital tax: 900 francs; total: 10,900 francs. C. Tax rate recently promulgated by the commercial treaty: regular tax: 8,500 francs; capital tax: 537.5 francs; balancing tax: 2,250 francs; total: 11,287.5 francs. According to the above examples, it can be proved that after the new treaty was signed, the Vietnamese customs' import tax rate on Chinese silk was not only heavier than that collected under the old treaty, but also more than that collected under the ordinary tax rate without a treaty. The added balancing tax, although claimed to be 25%, is assessed according to the exchange rate, which is actually an arbitrary floating assessment without any standards, and sometimes it is even levied at 50%. The capital tax is calculated by adding all costs and taxes paid, and then assessing the value, which is taxation within taxation. Therefore, the value of import taxes on Chinese silk is generally between 100% and 150% of the value. Overseas Chinese merchants cannot afford such harsh taxes and levies. If Chinese silk wants to be exported to Vietnam, its livelihood will be cut off. The association cannot remain silent in the face of such pain, so it submits this petition. It is hoped that the Executive Yuan and the Ministry will review and approve it, and promptly lodge a serious protest with the French government. All surtaxes other than those stipulated in the official treaty and the attached schedule should be stopped. It must also be guaranteed that no new taxes will be created and no floating taxes will be collected in the future. The regular tax levied should also be noted and should not be higher than the import tax of non-reciprocal countries, to comply with the principle of the lowest tax rate in the attached schedule, so as to realize the spirit of reciprocity in the treaty. If the French side delays and ignores the negotiations, it seems that our government can also levy other additional taxes on coal, rice and other items transported from Annam to our country to show retaliation. It is appropriate to decide, I am trembling to await orders, in addition to the attached comparative table of tax rates, respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Explanation: From May 1926, the tax was increased from 200 francs to 800 francs per 100 kilograms. After October of the same year, it was increased to 1,360 francs. From July 1927, in addition to the regular tax in the previous clause, a capital tax of 2% of the value was added, based on a minimum valuation of 18,000 francs per 100 kilograms, with a tax of 360 francs per 100 kilograms. From July 1929, the Sino-French commercial treaty expired, and our country lost the most-favored-nation tax rules and was treated according to the ordinary tax rate of countries without a treaty. In January 1933, the capital tax was increased to 5% of the value. On August 8, 1935, the new tax rules were implemented, and the regular tax was slightly reduced, but the capital tax was not abolished. The French side created another name for the balancing tax. Combining the various tax items, it was not only not reduced, but heavier than the tax paid without a treaty.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Ministry of Finance Adjusts the Banking System <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Central Bank to be Reorganized into a Reserve Bank; Mint to Start Minting Decimal Subsidiary Coins</p>
<p>According to Central News Agency, after the Ministry of Finance implemented the new currency system policy, it is determined to adjust the domestic banking system. The first step is to reorganize the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank. After the resolution of the plenary meeting of the board of directors, 40% of commercial shares will be raised. The matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Central Mint is minting decimal subsidiary coins. After the promulgation of the subsidiary coin regulations, minting will begin. After the reporter learned about the situation, the details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval</p>
<p>The reorganization of the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank was approved by the plenary meeting of the bank's board of directors last month. According to Article 7 of the current Central Bank Law, 40% of the commercial shares will be raised (the bank's current capital is 100 million yuan). The matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. At the same time, preparations for reorganization are being actively planned. It can be implemented as soon as the order from the Executive Yuan is received. In the future, all ordinary banking businesses of the bank, such as remittance, mortgage, trust savings, etc., will be transferred to specialized banks for exclusive operation, and the businesses of various banks will be adjusted according to their nature. The Ministry of Finance will also appoint experts from the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank to various banks to supervise and assist in the improvement of their businesses.</p>
<p>Decimal Subsidiary Coins to be Minted Soon</p>
<p>After the implementation of the new currency system policy, the national currency standard system has been unified. The consolidation of subsidiary coins is currently under study. The subsidiary coin models ordered by the Central Mint from the United States have been shipped, and trials are currently underway.

<h3 id="e104">A Visit to a 111-Year-Old Woman <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Such an Elderly Person Encountering Disaster and Displacement; Fortunately, a Great-Grandson Serves Her with Great Care</p>
<p>According to the "North China Daily News," a representative of the newspaper visited Zhang, a 111-year-old woman from Shandong, at the Renji Hospital yesterday (the 21st). The woman is almost blind and has lost all her teeth, but she is still in good physical condition and can get out of bed without assistance. Although her memory is almost completely gone, she can still understand the Shandong dialect and express her needs. The woman usually lies quietly and does not care much about food. She now mostly relies on liquids such as milk for nourishment. The hospital staff feels sorry for the woman who is so old and displaced and has raised money to help her return to her hometown of Jining. The representative of the "North China Daily News" sat by the old woman's bed and had a short conversation with her, shouting into her ear. The woman said she felt very comfortable. When asked what she wanted to eat, the woman shook her hand and replied, "What food is good to eat?" The woman also said that she came to Shanghai to find relatives but did not find them. She had lived in a village and had never been out before. When the representative asked her about some aspects of her life, the woman only smiled and shook her head frequently. The woman's forehead is wrinkled, but it does not hide her kind face. She always answers warmly to those who talk to her. The woman has only one great-grandson, who is already thirty-two years old. According to a certain doctor, the man serves his great-grandmother carefully and meticulously, which is touching. He is proud to have such an elderly great-grandmother and takes care of her in every possible way. It so happened that the man was also lying ill in the hospital, so the representative was able to ask about his family history and learned that his name was Zhang San. Because of the flood in his hometown, he took the old woman by train to Pukou and came to Shanghai to find his cousin Wen, who worked as a policeman in the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. After boarding the ship in Pukou, all of his luggage was stolen, and one of the old woman's clothes was also inside. The travel expenses of several yuan and the address of his cousin Wen were all sewn into the clothes. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, they had no money to buy food and no place to go, so they begged for food. Soon after, the old woman fell ill in the street. Just as they were worried and distressed, a Western patrolman from the Central Police Station happened to pass by, saw them, and took pity on them. After inquiring about everything, he sent the old woman to the hospital. A few days later, Zhang San also fell ill. Zhang San's grandparents and parents had all passed away, and his only relative was his cousin, who was said to be working as a policeman in the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. Zhang San was raised by the old woman since he was an infant. When he grew up, he opened a teahouse for a living. Recently, he lost everything due to the flood. He was overjoyed when he received a letter from his cousin in Shanghai and decided to come to Shanghai to find him. Zhang San recalled that his great-grandmother was born in the fifth year of the Daoguang reign (1825) and became a widow at the age of twenty-one, which is now ninety years ago. Her children and grandchildren had all died early. Zhang San is still a widower and depends on his great-grandmother. He had never left his village before the flood. According to the old woman's birth year, she was born in 1825 by the Gregorian calendar. When she got married, foreigners had just arrived in Shanghai. At that time, the Shanghai Concession was still a desolate area. Counting her life, she has lived through five emperors and entered the Republic of China for twenty-four years. Also, in hospitals, it is common to see babies, but it is rare to see elderly people over eighty years old. Now, Renji Hospital has received the patronage of this elderly woman, which can be considered a hard record to break.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Railway to Collect and Dispatch Postal and Telegraph Items: Three Bureaus Have Agreed on Implementation Measures; Official Implementation Starting Next Month on the 1st, with Postal and Telegraph Fees and Other Details Remaining Unchanged <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Ministries of Transportation and Railways are planning for railway stations to collect and dispatch postal and telegraph items for passengers. It has been decided that, starting from the 1st of next month, a trial run will be conducted at nine major stations along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. The postal and telegraph bureaus of these two railway lines have already agreed on implementation measures. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding Telegrams: Major stations that establish telegraph collection and dispatch services will have the railway bureau designate, within a possible scope, two windows—one near the ticket office and one near the platform. This will facilitate the sending and receiving of telegrams by passengers in waiting rooms and on trains. The railway bureau will also assign personnel to collect and dispatch telegrams on the train and deliver telegrams sent by passengers or to passengers on the train. This will allow passengers to communicate with others while traveling. The telegraph fee will be the same as for ordinary telegrams, charged according to regulations, without additional line fees.</p>
<p>Regarding Postal Items: For the sending and receiving of postal items, for example, if a passenger traveling from Shanghai to Nanjing wishes to communicate with Shanghai while passing through Suzhou or Zhenjiang, they can send postal items on the train and have the on-train personnel dispatch them. If someone in Shanghai wants to send something to a passenger on the train, they must specify the train time and the class the passenger is traveling in. The railway bureau's information office will notify the station by telephone to inform the passenger.</p>
<p>Trial Run Next Month: The railway postal and telegraph stations along the railway line have been regulated by the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways. The (Beijing-Shanghai Line) Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Shanghai North Station, (Shanghai-Hangzhou Line) Shanghai South Station, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and other nine major stations under the jurisdiction of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration will conduct a trial run first. The Shanghai Postal General Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, and the Railway Ministry's two Railway Administration bureaus have agreed to implement this from January 1, 25th year. Detailed measures for all stations' collection and dispatch of postal and telegraph items will be announced via press release in the coming days.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Ministry of Interior Informs the Municipal Government: Police Agencies to Increase Gas Gun Provisions; So That Police Officers Can Perform Their Duties; Immediate Orders to the Public Safety Bureau to Comply <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to the Industrial News Agency, the Ministry of Interior, in view of police cases, when the police are performing their duties of apprehending criminals, must consider preserving the lives of the criminals and suspects before the case has been judged. This often results in arresting officers watching the criminals escape or continuing criminal behavior. Even though they have weapons in hand, they find it difficult to enforce prohibition. To remedy this, the Ministry of Interior has adopted scientific police weapon equipment, similar to that used in other countries, and added gas guns to enable police officers to perform their duties. The Ministry yesterday sent a special notice to the municipal government, instructing its affiliated police agencies to uniformly add this type of equipment, and to impart scientific knowledge for its application, to increase the strength of maintaining local security. It is reported that after receiving the order, the municipal government immediately ordered the Public Safety Bureau to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e120">City Public Safety Bureau Submits to the Ministry of Finance: Urging Allocation of Stamp Tax Awards; The Ministry of Finance Has Forwarded the Consultation to the Ministry of Judicial Administration <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau previously submitted a request to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Ministry of Finance, which in turn forwarded it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, instructing the local courts to expedite the allocation of public expenses and bonuses that the Bureau had submitted for trial in the stamp tax violation cases, so that they could be allocated to the relevant personnel to reward them. Now, the Ministry of Finance has approved it and approved a consultation to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, instructing the Shanghai Local Court to promptly conclude the cases submitted for trial and to allocate the fines obtained. The original consultation of the Ministry of Finance Tax Character No. 19823 is as follows: It is found that since the stamp tax stamps were changed to be sold by the post office, the responsibility for inspecting stamp matters has been assigned to the municipal and county governments. This matter is purely of an obligatory nature and has no designated funds. In order to subsidize the inspection agencies and reward the inspection personnel, the Ministry has specially stipulated in the Rules for Inspecting Stamp Tax that if there are no informants in the case, 20% of the fines should be used to subsidize the operating expenses of the inspection agency, and 20% should be awarded to the personnel who have made efforts in handling the case. Subsequently, the 20% subsidy obtained by the inspection agency was very small and insufficient for office use. This Ministry has re-approved the agreement of your Ministry to revise the provisions for the distribution of fines in the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax Fines and Execution Rules of the Judicial Organs, stipulating that 40% of the cases obtained by the inspection agency should be used for the operating expenses of the judicial organs, 40% should be used for the operating expenses of the inspection agency, and 20% should be awarded to the personnel who have made efforts in the matter. This case is currently being submitted to the National Government by the Executive Yuan together with the Judicial Yuan for approval. The fines that the inspection agencies and inspection personnel should receive are very important for carrying out the inspection work and should be allocated as soon as they are received for office use. It is also found that in order to improve the methods for the court to hear stamp tax cases, your Ministry has issued a notice to all courts to comply with it. From now on, when handling such cases, except for those with doubts that cannot be concluded without investigation, they should be concluded within three days. The books and records should be returned immediately upon conclusion of the case. The local judicial organs should comply with this. In response to the consultation, a copy of the original consultation and a copy of the original submission are enclosed for your Ministry to review and instruct the Shanghai Local Court to promptly conclude the cases of violations of the Stamp Tax Regulations submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau and to send the fines due to the Bureau for distribution. In addition, according to the report of the Stamp Tax Inspection Committee of the Ministry, there are also delays in the trial of cases of violations of stamp tax laws by other judicial organs. Please reiterate the previous order and strictly order that the cases submitted for trial be concluded as soon as they are tried and that the fines received be allocated as soon as they are concluded, so that the stamp inspection work and the use of certificates by merchants and the public will be convenient.</p>

The Ximen Branch sent detective team leader 沈文达, along with detective squad leader 禹如海, and took the two suspects 王胡 to arrest 叶子才 at the residence, with the help of the French police. He was sent to the Second Special Court. Although he was summoned twice, he could not be brought to justice because the defendant's appeal period had not expired.

<p>陈耀先, from Chuansha County, Pudong, used to work in the foreign accounts department of Yongxing Foreign Firm. His deceased father and the father of his cousin 陈克扬 were both clansmen and close friends, so financial dealings were common. In 1925, 陈克扬's father borrowed 500 taels of silver from 陈耀先's father. Later, a person named 黄心一, with 陈耀先's father as guarantor, purchased goods from 陈克扬's father, totaling over 490 taels of silver, so the debts were offset at that time. Unexpectedly, after many years, since the death of 陈耀先's father, 陈耀先 suddenly filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special Court in July last year, suing 陈克扬's father to recover the loan of his deceased father. After several court sessions, because the defendant did not arrive, a public announcement was made, and a default judgment was made. It was found that 陈克扬's father also had real estate in Chuansha County, so he applied to the execution court of the First Special Court, requesting that the Chuansha County Government assist in the execution, sealing up and auctioning off his real estate. The Special Court approved the request. Now, 陈克扬, claiming that the real estate in Chuansha is not owned by his father, but is his personal property, has filed an objection to the execution with the Chuansha County Government and requested a suspension of the auction. He has also filed a lawsuit against 陈耀先, demanding compensation for the guarantee of goods worth over 490 taels of silver that his father often provided.</p>

<p>The Women's Reformatory, sponsored by the Chinese Women's Temperance Association on Liuying Road in Zhabei, has been accommodating orphaned and helpless women for many years, and there is a risk of overcrowding. The association is finding it difficult to provide for clothing and food, so it plans to publicly select spouses in the near future so that single men and women can conclude favorable marriages. However, the conditions are very strict on the protection of women's rights. In addition to conducting a thorough investigation of the applicant's origin, family, occupation, temperament, and appearance, it is also stipulated that there must be a monogamous system, the age must not exceed thirty, and a security deposit of 200 yuan must be paid. If no changes occur in the middle of the relationship, the security deposit will be used to pay for the association's upbringing. If, after the marriage, it is discovered that the husband's temperament is violent and unbearable to live with, or if there are unexpected circumstances, the adopted daughter can still return to the reformatory to live, and the security deposit will be used to provide a proper life. If there are any applicants from all walks of life, they can go to the association at the end of Yuanming Road to obtain photos and fill out application documents. Then, the association will send someone to guide them to meet at the reformatory. After that, the man will be investigated and the woman's consent will be obtained, and a satisfactory marriage can be concluded on a scheduled date.</p>

<p>This year's New Life Movement of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has already ended, and from next spring, it will begin to continue according to the planned plan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Work Completed: The Municipal Public Security Bureau, since its establishment this year, has stipulated a plan and followed it to promote the New Life Movement. There is only about one week left this year, and the end of the year is coming soon, so all New Life Movement work has ended. The promotion of the New Life Movement this year has been quite effective. The most outstanding achievements of the work are the training of police to familiarize them with the methods of promoting the New Life Movement, the general inspection of public places throughout the city, guiding and correcting them, and ordering them to pay attention to neatness and cleanliness, and the rectification of vendors, ordering them to set up in designated places, so as not to hinder traffic, and paying attention to hygiene. The above are the most outstanding achievements of the bureau after promoting the New Life Movement this year. After the end of this year's New Life Movement work, the New Life Movement work in the next year's plan will begin next spring. It is said that the most important points can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Hygiene: Actively promote public hygiene, such as paying attention to the freshness and rot of vegetables in the city's small vegetable markets and the order of display. Other places, such as tofu shops and cold drink shops, should also be ordered to pay attention to public hygiene, so as to avoid the risk of infection from eating.</p>
<p>Organize the City Appearance: The city appearance is closely related to the New Life Movement, so organizing the city appearance is also one of the important tasks of the New Life Movement next year. Shops should pay attention to the neatness of their plaques and the cleanliness of the miscellaneous items displayed in front of the shop. Vendors should be actively rectified, and the display of goods at major road intersections should be prohibited. Although display is allowed on branch roads, it must be absolutely based on the principle of not hindering traffic. All such work will be the New Life Movement work planned for next year.</p>
<p>Beggars' Shelter: The city's beggars' shelter was opened on the 15th of this month, but the scale is larger than before. This work was originally the New Life Movement work in next year's plan, but because the weather is cold, this work has started to be carried out this year. Next year, it will continue to be carried out and will be actively accommodated, so that the beggars in the city will be free from the risk of wandering and starvation.</p>

<p>A few days ago, when the Suzhou River was being dredged at Beixin泾, Zhoujiaqiao, Puxi, seven workers from Jiangbei, 徐茂人, 徐作贵, 蒋桂兰, 高连喜, 葛九金, 吴怀瑾, and 仇老头子, discovered a large paper package while digging mud there. Later, 徐作贵 snatched it. When they were about to distribute it at the Gao Shengchi Bathhouse in Caojiadu浜, a fellow bather, 殷大富, overheard them and secretly reported it to the detective squad there, who went to arrest them. Except for 徐茂人, 蒋桂兰, and 高连喜, who were arrested on the spot, 徐作贵, etc., had already escaped in advance. They have been strictly arrested and are on file. It is now learned that the fugitive 徐作贵 had been reported by an informant, 胡某, to have 700 yuan in foreign currency and two real and fake handguns. 梁钰, the captain of the detective squad of the Caojiadu Public Security Branch, and Deputy Captain 董申利 ordered detective 苏瑞亭, etc., to go to the address to arrest him at about 11 AM yesterday. They arrested 徐作贵, a 19-year-old from Baoying, and suspect 郭贵宝, a 20-year-old from Baoying, in a thatched shed. They were brought back to the team for questioning. According to their confession, there were only 35 yuan in foreign currency and 40 cents in small change in the paper package, which had already been distributed and spent. The rest of their statements were evasive. The team leader, believing that their words were cunning and that they were by no means good people, is currently conducting a strict interrogation.</p>

<p>吴发's kiln cargo ship from Jiangbei, fully loaded with 5,700 bricks and tiles, was passing near the Asia Wharf at about 6 PM on the 11th of this month when it was suddenly hit by a merchant ship, causing the entire ship to capsize. All the people on the ship fell into the river, and all the kiln cargo was sunk to the bottom of the river. Neighboring ships rescued the shipowner 吴长发 and five of the crew members, who were lucky enough to survive. 吴's wife, 吴陈氏, and crew member 陈二 (46 years old, from Jiangbei) tragically drowned, and their bodies were nowhere to be found. 吴长发 reported the incident to the water police station, who have been trying to salvage the bodies for days. It was not until the day before yesterday that the bodies of 吴陈氏 and 陈二 were recovered. Detective 徐爵禄 from the police station, accompanied by the deceased's husband 吴长发 and the deceased's son 陈长富, went to the local court prosecutor's office to request an autopsy.

<h3 id="e132">郭辅庭 Sued by Daughter-in-Law for Breach of Contract; Daughter-in-Law Suffered for Father-in-Law's Matters, But the Promised Funds Were Not Paid <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>潮州 businessman 郭辅庭, nearing 50 years old, owning a large fortune, and residing at No. 4, Fu'an里, South Chengdu Road, was recently sued by his eldest daughter-in-law, 郭俞氏, represented by lawyers 章士钊 and 吕世芳, in the civil court of the First Special Court for breach of contract. The main points of the lawsuit were that the plaintiff previously married 郭豫材, the son of the defendant, and lived in their original home in 潮州. In May of the Republic of China Year 22, the plaintiff came to Shanghai due to a matter, bringing with her a maid, 陈氏 (also known as 陈莲香), who lived in the defendant's home. Then, the defendant, 郭辅庭, saw that the maid 陈氏 was somewhat attractive and harbored malicious intentions, seducing her in every way, and eventually raping her. Before long, she became pregnant and gave birth to a son in June of the Republic of China Year 23, named 关鸿. 郭, having a son in his old age, cherished him, and on July 3 of the same year, entered into a contract with 陈氏, stating that 郭辅庭 would allocate real estate in this city worth 200,000 yuan, with 150,000 yuan as the inheritance of his son 关鸿 and 50,000 yuan as the alimony for 陈氏, and built a separate "fragrant nest" outside. However, before long, 郭辅庭's wife found out that her husband's affair with the maid was caused by the daughter-in-law 俞氏, so she transferred her anger to 俞氏, secretly ordering her son to write a letter to blame her, and even threatening to divorce her. Later, the defendant, feeling guilty that his daughter-in-law 俞氏 had offended her mother-in-law and husband and would have no means of support in the future, explicitly stated that he was willing to take one-third of the alimony of 50,000 yuan for 陈氏, totaling 16,700 yuan, and give it to the plaintiff, 郭俞氏, as living expenses, and a written agreement was signed on December 12 of the Republic of China Year 23 as proof. Unexpectedly, after signing the agreement, he did not fulfill it, and the monthly subsidy of 50 yuan that was to be given to the plaintiff was also stopped from August of this year, causing 俞氏 to lose her livelihood. She requested that the court investigate and pursue the matter according to law. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned both parties to the 13th court session at 4 PM on the day before yesterday (the 20th), presided over by Judge 黄大熙. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the case, and then the defendant's agent, lawyer 陈霆锐, stated that the lawyer still needed to study the case and requested a postponement. The court approved the request and adjourned the hearing to January 9.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Old Woman Discovers Rebellious Son Hiding Unlicensed Handgun, Case Concludes with Sentencing Pending, Gun Reported for Investigation <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Gu Qian, an 81-year-old local Catholic woman residing at No. 5, Lane 1177, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, recently filed a complaint with the French Police Department against her rebellious son, Gu Fengxiang (also known as Tianzhen, also known as Congling, 37 years old this year), accusing him of attempted extortion and assaulting his elders, requesting investigation. The arresting officer approved the request and dispatched Detective Liu Kunbao to detain Gu and escort him to Criminal Division 8 of the Special District Court. Judge Qiu Huan-ying's interrogation was adjourned to a later date. In the continued hearing the other day, the plaintiff, Gu Qian, stated that the defendant, Fengxiang, had been raised as her son since childhood, for over thirty years, costing a significant amount of money. Unexpectedly, this rebellious son not only does not work but frequently comes home to extort money, spending it wantonly. If he is not satisfied, he resorts to violence and assaults me. As a woman, my heart trembles when I see him come home, and I am very afraid even of his shadow. Over the past two years, he has used up as much as 20,000 yuan. The other day, he again came home and forcibly demanded 10,000 yuan, resorting to violence when unsuccessful. I truly cannot bear this burden and request a severe punishment. When questioned, Gu Fengxiang confessed that he has no occupation because his mother loves him and has kept him in school for thirty years. All the ancestral property, over twenty acres of farmland, was managed by his mother after his father's death. Recently, due to the Public Works Department's planning of road land, there was a notice, and people, upon learning of it, came to demand to see it from his mother, leading to disputes. He dared not commit violence. Following arguments by the police department's lawyer, the court ordered the sentencing to be scheduled for the 23rd. The defendant's request for bail was denied, and he was returned to custody. After leaving the court, Gu Qian returned home and discovered a handgun hidden in her rebellious son's writing desk drawer, without a gun license. Fearing potential danger, she was greatly alarmed and immediately reported it to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>Lawyer Bai Hongxun, together with a fugitive Cantonese man surnamed Xu, had conspired to contract for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway dining car business, defrauding Ningbo residents like Jiang Youtang out of 1,800 yuan in handling fees. After the incident, it was discovered by the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, which sent letters to the French Police Department to arrest Bai and bring him to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution. As a result of the trial, Bai was sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment and ordered to compensate the plaintiffs, Jiang Youtang, with 1,800 yuan. Bai, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Second Special District Court Collegial Panel, and lawyers Yu Hualong and Tang Hao defended him. Due to Bai's illness, orchitis, while detained in the detention center, which Judge Xiong Ping verified, permission was granted for Yu and Tang to bail him out for medical treatment, and the case was temporarily suspended. This was reported previously. The other day, Judge Xiong opened an investigation hearing and summoned him. According to lawyer Yu Hualong, he recently received a letter from the appellant's uncle stating that Bai Hongxun was planning to escape. Lawyers Yu and Tang did not wish to guarantee him and requested release from bail, submitting Bai's uncle's letter as evidence. The court instructed that the lawyers should hand Bai Hongxun over to the court to be relieved of their responsibility as guarantors. Lawyer Yu exited the court.</p>

<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the Ministry of Judicial Administration yesterday ordered the local court of this city to improve the instruction and education in new and old prisons. The original text of the order is excerpted as follows: "Prison instruction and education are fundamental to improving prison administration. Education enhances the intelligence of those in prison. Neither should be neglected. To achieve fulfillment, in addition to the original instructors and teachers who should continue to be fully responsible, talent from other fields should be borrowed to make up for deficiencies. The proposed measures are as follows: (A) Regarding enriching instruction and education in new prisons: The instructor is fully responsible for the instruction of prisoners. The instructor is also responsible for paying close attention to releases from prison, punishments, and inspection of letters. The supervising authority should also send a letter to the Chinese Buddhist Association, inviting monks or lay Buddhists to take responsibility for group instruction in the new prison, and provide an appropriate subsidy to the person sent by the Buddhist Association, limited to 20 yuan per month. The results of instruction should be reported monthly by the warden of each prison, stating the facts, and submitted to the supervising officer for random inspection. Literacy boards should be hung in each cell and workshop, changed every three days, and explained by a teacher. During education, practice should be ordered, so that they can write and use [the characters]. In addition to textbooks, more books on cause and effect should be prepared, and a library should be established to arouse good thoughts. (B) Regarding enriching instruction and education in old prisons: The local county magistrate and court president or chief prosecutor should select philanthropists who are enthusiastic about public welfare or sincerely practicing monks, with the consent of the Prison Cooperation Committee members, and appoint them as prison instructors, reporting to the Provincial High Court for record. Subsidies should be negotiated within a possible range. If it is effectively managed, a report can be submitted to the High Court at the end of the year for honorary awards. Educational matters must be undertaken by prison staff themselves, with the guards assisting. Prisons where instruction and education are effectively managed will be specially rewarded by the High Court after verification."</p>

<h3 id="e139">Gangs of Beggars Forcibly Seizing Food, a Worrying Trend, Eleven Violent Individuals Detained <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Recently, in areas such as the southern city and the inner city, there have been groups of scantily clad people, forming gangs and seeking food along the streets. Whenever they encounter pancake stalls or steamed bun shops, these individuals snatch food to fill their stomachs. The shop owners who are robbed can only resign themselves to their bad luck and not argue. These individuals, believing themselves to be successful and relying on their numbers, have become increasingly rampant. In recent days, these individuals have been seen loitering in the streets, cleverly seizing and forcibly taking food, acting without restraint. Everyone is surprised by this behavior, which is detrimental to local security. Therefore, instructions have been given to patrol officers to prohibit them at any time. The other day, a large group of emaciated young beggars, wearing ragged clothes and barefoot, snatched food in the Fangbang Road area. When the patrol officer saw them and tried to stop them, it was ineffective, and the atmosphere became tense. The officer had no choice but to call for assistance from neighboring patrols and detained eleven ringleaders, including He Jincun, Jin Nianbao, Li Yaoqing, Wang Yuxiao, Song Zuying, Chen Ziwan, Jiang Jikuan, Zhang Xinggeng, Sheng Yaoxian, Wang Zishan, and Wang Arong, taking them to the police station. The rest scattered. After a brief interrogation, the police station sent them to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau, who transferred them to the Procuratorate of the Local Court. Prosecutor Zhang Zi interrogated them and ordered them to be detained pending investigation. When the beggars were being led down from the courtroom, they smiled at each other, saying that their lives could be worry-free for the time being. Although they would have to endure the taste of iron bars, it was better than making a living in the piercing north wind all day long. The act of beggars joining together to seize food not only affects the small businesses of pancake stalls but also cultivates the habit of robbery. It is hoped that the authorities will take measures to ensure the peace and tranquility of society as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter Requesting Correction of Power Company's Disconnection and Orders Compensation for Losses <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Concession Bureau yesterday stating: "On the 20th of this month, we received a letter from Dechang Machinery Factory stating, 'Our factory's monthly electricity consumption is only about 30 yuan, and we paid a deposit of 75 taels of silver. Previously, electricity bills were collected every three months. Now, the company has changed to collecting monthly during this period of economic downturn. Our factory calculated the November electricity bill as 30 yuan and 8 cents. Because the manager was away, we notified the company that we would pay on December 16th, but we were unable to do so in time, resulting in a combined bill for November and December totaling 63 yuan and 9 cents, stating that payment was due by December 27th. If payment was not made by then, we would be notified according to regulations and given a seven-day grace period, after which the power could be cut off. However, the company did not comply with the deadline and, without exceeding the deposit of 75 taels of silver, suddenly sent someone to our factory on the morning of the 18th and immediately cut off the power line. The company not only does not sympathize with the hardships of the people and provide a grace period to users but also changed to collecting electricity fees monthly and did not notify all Shanghai users of the change in regulations or refund the excess deposits to profit from interest. This is unfair in terms of reason and principle. Our factory went to the company to negotiate on the same day and was told that the power line would be reconnected in the afternoon, and then we would be notified to recover the excess deposit and pay the electricity fee monthly thereafter. This type of user is mostly Chinese industry and commerce, which is already difficult to support in this economic downturn, and is now suffering this unexpected loss. It is unimaginable. Therefore, we specifically request your association to uphold justice and provide assistance, and send a letter to the company to prevent such unreasonable disconnections in the future, in order to assist users and warn the future,' etc. The deposit collected by the Electric Power Company from users for three months of electricity charges was originally to ensure that the company collected electricity fees every three months to prevent users from abusing electricity. Now that the company has changed to collecting electricity fees monthly, logically, the deposit paid by users should be reduced proportionally. As evidenced by the Dechang Factory incident, the arrears did not exceed the deposit, and the deadline had not exceeded the specified time in the notification. The company cut off the power line and stopped feeding electricity. Its absurd handling is already undeniable. If the deposit is reduced, the company is not unable to prevent users from abusing electricity. According to the aforementioned situation, we hereby request your bureau to order the company to return the deposit collected from users for two months of electricity fees after the company changed from annual to monthly collection, to correct the illegal disconnection of Dechang Factory, and to order compensation for the losses caused by the disconnection, in order to maintain the interests of users."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Public Concession, Health Status for November <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Public Health Department chief's report for November states that the health status of the Concession during the month did not have any significant or unusual changes. Respiratory diseases did have a general increase at times, but in terms of the season, this is not at all unusual. Generally speaking, the health status of the Public Concession in November can be considered satisfactory. However, one thing that can be considered unusual is that the number of reported malaria cases in November was almost the same as the previous month, with as many as 71 reported cases of malaria during the month. This may also be due to the fact that citizens are gradually becoming accustomed to reporting diseases. However, it is difficult to speculate whether this conjecture is reliable at this time. In addition, in addition to the residents of this city, there are also northerners who were building railways in Jiangxi and contracted malaria. They returned north and passed through this port, but were too weak to continue their journey, so they stayed in Shanghai. A total of 12 of these people were sent to the Public Concession Isolation Hospital, and 9 of them died soon after. The Concession health authorities have now agreed on a method of cooperation with the Chinese side to avoid the spread of malignant malaria everywhere. Furthermore, most of the above 11 people also suffered from dysentery at the same time, one suffered from typhoid fever, and one suffered from eczema, making treatment hopeless, resulting in death. A total of four cases of smallpox were reported this month, two Chinese and two Westerners. A total of 89 people were bitten by rabid dogs and requested treatment this month, 18 of whom came from other ports. The birth rate of Chinese and foreign residents in this port: a total of 92 foreign births were reported, 81 of whom lived in the Concession, divided into 38 boys and 43 girls. The number of Chinese children born and reported increased by about 400 from the same month last year, totaling 2,137, of whom 2,059 lived in the Concession, divided into 1,163 baby boys and 896 baby girls. In terms of deaths, there were a total of 31 foreigners, of which 68% were non-Chinese Asians. The major causes of death were pulmonary tuberculosis, heart disease, inflammation, and digestive system diseases. Among the Chinese, the major causes of death were old age, pulmonary tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and bronchitis.</p>

<p>The British-owned Baoding Insurance Sub-Company, located in Room 306, 3rd Floor, Citibank, 45 Jiujiang Road, all of the company's Chinese staff, from the compradore Qian Yanping down, are addicted to gambling. Therefore, they set up a gambling den in the room, equipped with gambling equipment such as Pai Gow and dice, and start gambling every day after the Western staff and the bosses return to their residences for lunch or when they stop working at dusk. Many of the Chinese staff in the Citibank downstairs who hear about it also take the opportunity to go upstairs and join the game, with heavy losses. Over time, the matter leaked out, and the competent General Patrol Room specially sent detectives Li Wenhan and Wang Bocheng to investigate and confirm. They immediately reported it to the First Special District Local Court. At 1:00 p.m. the other day, the two detectives secretly went to arrest them and arrested Qian Yanping, Li Wankang, Wu Cailong, Zhang Taoqi, Ma Zhanggen, Wu Youcai, and Zhang at the scene.

<p>Liao Aqian, a 61-year-old man from Chaozhou, had retired in Shanghai due to old age. He was lodging on a bed in the Qiacheng Food Store, owned by a fellow townsman, at 25 Rue Pessonnel in the French Concession, working as a street vendor from early morning until night. On the 21st, at 2 PM, Liao suddenly felt cold and unwell. Having no place to rest in the Qiacheng store during the day, he shivered restlessly. At that time, Gu Benlin (37 years old), a cook from Pudong working at the store, whose residence was in the overhanging building at 37 Yinhe Lane, Min'guo Road, saw Liao's discomfort and kindly invited him to rest at his home. He accompanied Liao there and, due to the cold weather, lit a coal briquette stove and placed it beside the bed for warmth. Unexpectedly, Liao was poisoned by the coal fumes. At 4 PM, Gu went to check on him and found that Liao, due to his old age and weakened state, was unable to resist. His breathing was faint. Gu immediately called for an ambulance and a doctor, who performed artificial respiration for two hours without success. At 6 PM, Liao was rushed to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late; he died. The French police were notified and sent detectives to investigate. Meanwhile, the body was taken to the Tongren Zhuan'yuan Funeral Hall for examination. The deceased had a son named Jin, currently 26 years old, working as a partner at the Jincheng Pawnshop at 113 Tongzhou Road in Hongkou. Detectives were sent to inform him.

<h3 id="e153">Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau to Install German-Style Gas Generators <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the highway system in Hunan Province has developed rapidly in recent years. The Highway Bureau, due to business expansion and increased routes, feels that the number of vehicles is insufficient for its application, therefore, it has specially ordered sixty "Wanguo" brand automobiles from Shanghai. The first batch of twenty vehicles has already arrived. The authorities, considering the excessive consumption of gasoline, are planning to convert to gas generators. The Finance and Construction Departments' Audit Committee and the Highway Bureau each sent representatives to form a Gas Generator Review Committee, which held a technical competition on Tanbao Road. Competitors included Li Baohe's Chinese Gas Engine Manufacturing Factory from Hankou, the Xiangde type from the Shanghai Chinese Gas Vehicle Manufacturing Company, and the Tang Zhongmin type from the Shanghai Zhongming Factory. After a month-long evaluation, the Xiangde type was deemed the best, followed by the Li Baohe type, and then the Tang Zhongmin type. The committee reported this to the Construction Department, and it is reported that the Construction Department has also decided to adopt the Xiangde type gas generator across the board. A contract is expected to be signed soon, and the conversion to gas generators will be implemented in the near future for use on various routes.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Rent Reduction Movement Summary <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>More than 30 tenants of Weishen Lane, Pingliang Road, joined the Shanghai Rent Reduction Association a few days ago. They immediately elected representatives, including Chen Delian, etc., six people, led by Association representative Zhuo Wen to negotiate rent reduction with the landlord Zhu Shien. It is heard that the landlord is only willing to collect 90% of the rent. The representatives considered that this result was not satisfactory. Now they have unanimously stopped paying rent and deposited the rent due in the bank, determined to fully achieve their goal. In Zhabei, Xibao and Baoxing Lanes had also independently organized rent reduction associations to demand rent reductions from the landlord, Tongfu Company. After more than a year of litigation, the court ordered an 85% rent payment. At that time, the Bao Le'an Road incident occurred, and rumors spread, causing uninformed tenants to flee. Less than a quarter of the tenants remained. Now, the second landlord of the lane, Jiang Zhu, etc., said that since most of the tenants had moved away, they were unable to cover the rent. Therefore, they joined the Shanghai Rent Reduction Association and convened a general meeting on the 15th. Zhuo Wen, sent by the Association, provided guidance and formed the Twelfth Branch. Jiang Zhu, Xu Xianggen, Zhao Hongsheng, and four others were elected as executive committee members. They proposed a complete waiver of the January rent and requested the landlord to reduce the rent by 40% across the board starting in February next year.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Shanghai Hunting Association Schedules a Major Hunt in Yushan <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yushan is located on the border of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, connecting to Xia. The high mountains and steep ridges form a natural hunting area abundant with tigers, leopards, muntjacs, wild boars, and other beasts. The Shanghai Hunting Association had long designated it as a major hunting area. However, for several years, the area had been disturbed by Communist bandits, who plundered people's belongings, causing unease day and night. Therefore, despite their courage, they dared not attempt a hunt. Recently, after President Chiang Kai-shek suppressed the remaining bandits and the local area was pacified, Zhang Yinxun, a prominent member of the association from Yushan, also returned to his hometown to rebuild his home. He found that the number of wild animals in the mountains and fields had increased significantly compared to before. He sent a letter to Liu Jiuwei and Yuan Yang'an, executives of the Shanghai Hunting Association, inviting them to organize an expedition. The timing coincided with the Shanghai Hunting Association's major hunting period. The executives sent a general notice to hunters from all sides, including Qian Hongliang from Qianjiang, Weng Wenyin from Hangzhou, Chen Anyu, Yu Jixian, Shen Tu Chen from Tonglu, as well as local comrades Zhang Yuan, Heng Fang, Heng Quan, Li Liangmei, Yi Zhenchang, and He Jingdi. They will depart on the 28th of the national calendar, gather in Jianggan, Hangzhou, and advance along the Hangjiang Road on the morning of the 29th to rendezvous in Yushan, vowing to conquer the beasts. They will return on January 3rd, passing through Zhuji and Jizhou, and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on Sunday. Non-members are welcome to join. Registration is at 431, 4th Floor, Continental Emporium.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Request for Flexible Measures Regarding the Movement of Dinghua Sulfur, etc. <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Military Affairs, stating that Dinghua sulfur is finely textured, different from ordinary sulfur. It meets the standards specified in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, making it a pure medicinal product. It is commonly used in the treatment of diseases, both internally and externally, and is sold by pharmaceutical merchants in very small quantities. However, it is currently prohibited from being transported and sold at will due to its use in the production of gunpowder. In reality, with the advancement of modern science, sulfur is no longer widely used for making gunpowder. Although potassium chlorate has explosive properties, it is also a necessary medicine for treating throat inflammation and other ailments. The regulations of the Salt and Sulfur Bureau require large-scale purchases for transportation and sales, such as a minimum purchase of 2,000 pounds of sulfur at a time. Although transportation permits can be issued, the need for such a large quantity is non-existent for medicinal purposes. Therefore, although there is a way to obtain a permit, there is no need to obtain a permit for such a large quantity. As for small-scale purchases, there is absolutely no way to obtain them. In fact, if the goal is to prevent the private manufacture of military firearms, the focus should be on restricting large-scale purchases. If small quantities of one, two, or three to five pounds are needed for medicinal purposes but cannot be purchased, wouldn't this be the opposite of the government's intention to prevent private manufacturing? Therefore, the Association has decided to request the relevant ministries to negotiate a method for the small-scale transportation and sale of Dinghua sulfur, potassium chlorate, and potassium nitrate for medicinal purposes, in order to facilitate business and benefit medical treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Minutes of the Sixth Branch Meeting of the Second Special District Municipal Federation <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Sixth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Municipal Federation held an executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. Executive committee members Zhang Gengshan, Gu Fuxiang, Qu Zhenhua, Wang Liquan, Hu Xilai, Hu Kaiyuan, Zhang Gaojin, and Wu Guowei, executive committee member of the Eighth District Branch, and more than ten others were present. Zhang Gengshan was publicly elected as chairman. After formal greetings, the following resolutions were passed: A. More than 50 domestic servant introduction agencies (i.e., tout shops) on Julaida Road, etc., in the French Concession, jointly wrote to the Federation stating that the French police had issued a notice requiring all domestic servants to submit photographs to the police for record-keeping. It is often said that the Public Concession has not yet adopted this measure. If the French Concession implements it, domestic servants, being generally uneducated, will view this with fear and are bound to turn to introduction agencies in the Public Concession for recommendations. Julaida Road requests that the Chinese Tax Association and the French police be asked to temporarily postpone implementation and consider the matter further. After careful discussion by the committee members, it was resolved: To send separate letters to the Chinese Tax Association and the Municipal Federation within the French Concession, requesting that they forward a letter to the French authorities to consider and discuss the matter and temporarily postpone implementation. Send a letter to the French police based on the incoming letter, requesting them to postpone the action. B. The residents of Lutongkang Lane near the Sacred Heart Convent, collectively signed and sealed a letter proving that Cao Mao, wife of the husband's mother was being abused by her husband, but was falsely reported to the police by the husband's mother, Cao Chengyao, claiming that the wife had injured her parents. The case has been brought to court. They request that justice be served. After sending Wu Guowei to investigate and confirm that the charges were indeed false, it was resolved: To send a letter to the Women's Association, to send a letter to the Legal Department of the French police, to appoint a lawyer to appear in court for the trial, and to request lawyers Wang Shizong and Huang Zengjie Yangwu to serve as advocates. C. The French Water and Electricity Company is increasing the deposit for tap water meters. At a time when the market is depressed and business is sluggish, citizens cannot afford unexpected burdens. Moreover, the deposit system has been in place for a long time without causing harm. There is no need to increase it. It was resolved: To write to the Water Company to strongly argue for the cancellation of the proposed increase, taking into account the livelihood of the citizens.</p>

<p>The Wei Ya Restaurant in this city is famous for its exquisite Cantonese cuisine. It was founded in the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty on Chongming Road in Hongkou. The manager, He Yuechi, has always been praised by people from all walks of life for his excellent cooking skills. Later, the building was renovated, and the main restaurant was relocated to the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Peng Road, with a branch on Sima Road. These are the only two locations. He registered his business name separately with the Industry and Commerce Registration Bureau. However, in recent months, a counterfeit Wei Ya Restaurant and Wei Ya Restaurant have been established in the Baliqiao Road area. The owner believes that these counterfeit restaurants threaten the reputation of the real Wei Ya, and sent separate letters to the owners of the counterfeit restaurants, demanding that they cease using the Wei Ya name. The owner of the counterfeit Wei Ya Restaurant acknowledged the unfairness of their actions and immediately changed their name. However, the Wei Ya Restaurant owner refused to comply. The real Wei Ya Restaurant filed a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court, requesting that the counterfeit restaurant be prohibited from using the Wei Ya name and be required to pay damages. The court issued a summons. The other day, He Yuechi, accompanied by his lawyer, He Qingyun, appeared in court. After questioning by Judge Li Liang, the defendant admitted to using the Wei Ya name without permission and agreed to change the name. A settlement was reached in court. The defendant will change the name of Wei Ya to Xu Ya within one week. If the defendant fails to comply within the deadline, they will be required to pay the plaintiff a daily loss of 20 yuan, starting from the date of the unauthorized use of the name. The plaintiff will be entitled to request and enforce the payment.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Improving Chinese Accounting Forms: Reducing Costs and Guiding Usage <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, many businesses have been paying attention to improving accounting practices and adopting the improved Chinese accounting system developed by accountant Xu Yongzuo. This improved Chinese accounting system, after being registered with the Ministry of Interior of the National Government in 1933, has been manufactured and sold by the Standard Account Book and Form Manufacturing and Sales Office. Purchasers have found it very convenient, as they can refer to the "Introduction to Improved Chinese Accounting." Recently, accountant Xu has also compiled a book titled "Examples of Improved Chinese Accounting," which provides specific account formats for various account book entries, postings, and closings, printed as a book. Its contents are clearly organized, consistent from beginning to end, and resemble the account books and forms actually used by various industries and businesses. Those who adopt the improved accounting system will find it easier to understand its usage. The Standard Account Book and Form Manufacturing and Sales Office, recognizing the increasing number of adopters, has prepared a large stock of new products to meet the needs of various industries at the beginning of the New Year. The paper, printing, and binding are even better, and the cost has been reduced somewhat due to the use of mass production methods. Therefore, the selling price has also been slightly reduced compared to before. New Year's gifts related to improved Chinese accounting are also being given to those who purchase account books and forms, allowing them to refer to them at any time. In the past month, many companies and firms have pre-ordered new books or specially printed new books, and they have now been successively delivered. According to reporter investigations, accountant Xu has been working very hard on the improved Chinese accounting movement in recent years. The Standard Account Book and Form Manufacturing and Sales Office, which distributes improved Chinese account books and forms, has also made significant improvements to its production methods. This is indeed good news for the industrial and commercial circles of our country. The following are the improved features of the account books and forms and the New Year's preferential measures:</p>
<p>Improved Features of Account Books and Forms: According to accountant Xu, there are ten special features of improved Chinese account books and forms: Each account book has a fixed format printed on it, with clear divisions for the item to be recorded, the amount, the date, and the page number for cross-referencing. This makes recording and reviewing very convenient. There are many kinds of account books with separate spaces for recording amounts, with the amount columns divided into places for recording amounts in a more organized way. The end of each account book provides detailed instructions on how to use it, based on the format of that account book. The bookkeeper can follow these instructions. At the end of each account book, there are 32 bookkeeping instructions, specifying opening, recording, posting, settlement, and other procedures, so that the bookkeeper has a certain set of rules to follow. The beginning of each account book includes a list of managing personnel, which should include the name of the account book, the name of the bookkeeper, and the date of handover before bookkeeping can begin. This clarifies the responsibilities of the bookkeeper. Each account book is numbered page by page using a numbering machine to prevent missing or torn pages. The numbers can also be noted during posting for easy review. There are many types of account book formats, from primary books to subsidiary books, totaling ten types of paper. The formats required by various industries are complete. There are also a dozen types of accounts and vouchers, and the accounts required for settlement are all complete. Vouchers used for signing off on receipts and payments and for transmitting accounting information, whether for cash or transfers, are also available. The paper used is all domestic goods, with Luo Di paper used for various copying books and Hai Yue paper and Mao Bian paper used for journals. They are finely printed and bound in cloth, making them attractive and durable. Manufacturing is done using scientific methods and mass production, so delivery is fast and the selling price is lower than that of ordinary account books. There are books such as "Introduction to Improved Chinese Accounting" and "Examples of Improved Chinese Accounting" to provide detailed explanations of accounting principles and methods, as well as concrete examples. There is also a service department set up within the accountant Xu's office to provide services to users at any time. Anyone who adopts the improved Chinese accounting system can consult with the department at any time if they have any questions. They are always happy to provide guidance.</p>
<p>New Year's Preferential Treatment for Users: According to a key employee of the Standard Account Book and Form Manufacturing and Sales Office, the selling price has already been reduced due to mass production, which is already a preferential treatment for users. However, it is feared that adopters may not be fully aware of the accounting principles and methods. Therefore, they have agreed with accountant Xu to include books related to improved Chinese accounting as gifts. Anyone who purchases account books and forms totaling 5 yuan will receive a copy of "Introduction to Improved Chinese Accounting". Those who purchase account books and forms totaling 10 yuan will receive two copies of "Introduction to Improved Chinese Accounting" and "Examples of Improved Chinese Accounting". Those who purchase account books and forms totaling 15 yuan will receive three copies of "Introduction to Improved Chinese Accounting," "Examples of Improved Chinese Accounting," and "Collected Essays on Improved Chinese Accounting". These books are all written for improved Chinese accounting. The "Examples" book alone has a total of 750 pages and concretely displays account books with their postings, trial balances, and closings. It shows all the various formats, and is a very practical book. However, this gift offer is limited to the next two months. Anyone who purchases account books and forms from the general distribution office at 123 Aidaoya Road on the third floor, or from authorized distributors such as the Scientific Instrument Museum, World Bookstore, Yuanyi Printing House, Qiatat Paper Store, or Gaoshengda Paper Store, will also receive the gifts. If users need the Manufacturing and Sales Office to design an account book organization or specify the types of account books to be matched, the Office will be happy to provide such service.</p>

<p>Huaying Pharmacy Auctions Off Inventory: Since the Huaying Pharmacy on Nanjing Road in this city opened on the 20th to sell off its inventory, buyers have been unusually crowded every day. The threshold has been worn through. It is reported that the prices are indeed especially cheap compared to the market. However, the number of staff in the business department is small, so customers are often unable to be served in a timely manner, and the store closes and settles accounts at night, so those who arrive late are disappointed. An investigation of its internal inventory shows that it is still abundant. On one hand, the main store continues to sell at reduced prices to thank customers. On the other hand, letters have been sent to colleagues in other places to sell off a large batch of goods through bidding in order to end the sale as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e167">A Letter to Students of Beiping Schools from the Principal of a Jiangsu Province Middle School <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial United Association of Secondary Schools yesterday sent a letter to the students of various schools in Beiping, which read: "To the students of all schools in Beiping, greetings. Recent newspaper reports have revealed your magnificent movements for the sake of national territorial integrity and sovereign independence. You have not feared knives and axes or brute force. This spirit of indomitable power is truly the lifeblood of the nation and the glory of national revival. We, located far away in Jiangnan, upon hearing of this, cannot help but feel inspired by the righteousness of your determined movement and admire your fortitude. However, the national crisis is not yet over, and wolves are at our side. The peace of the entire nation cannot be hoped for overnight. The task of saving the nation and seeking survival in the future rests upon our shoulders. We must share the same hatred against the enemy, endure what must be endured, and speak out when we must speak out. If we do not slacken in this resolve, we will surely succeed in the end. While demonstrations and marches can arouse people's hearts for a time, they are not the key to saving the nation and seeking survival. Your spirit has already been displayed in this determined movement. May you continue this spirit and take a further step to dedicate yourselves to the country. We believe that because the national populace lacks education and has a shallow understanding of the nation, righteousness has waned, and selfishness abounds, leading to the emergence of traitors, which is heartbreaking to say. We have several points of self-encouragement to share with you, hoping you will adopt them:</p>
<p>1.  Cultivate the spirit of avenging humiliation and the idea that adversity strengthens a nation. Those who are in distress should know their responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. We must have the determination of Goujian to destroy Wu, and we must strive for advancement. Not avenging hatred or wiping away humiliation is a disgrace for a scholar. Without composure and fortitude, one cannot shoulder great responsibilities. Today's enemy may be strong, and we may be weak, but we must not be afraid. If all of us are willing to be like Tian Heng's loyal retainers, then even the might of Qin cannot do anything to us. We should be wary of the cunning of traitors. We should first demand excellence from ourselves and then extend it to others. How can we allow ourselves to be at the mercy of others forever?</p>
<p>2.  Strengthen our physical fitness. A difficult task cannot be accomplished by relying on extraordinary people. National crises cannot be resolved overnight. In the future, we will need to work tirelessly. Without strong physical fitness, how can we maintain a persevering spirit? The scholarly habit of weakness has been around for a long time. We should learn from past mistakes and recognize that physical training is more important than all other forms of self-cultivation. We should encourage each other to create a national atmosphere of valuing martial arts. Do not think that this is a roundabout way when disaster is imminent. We must know that the places where we will shed blood and sacrifice ourselves are not just one place or one time.</p>
<p>3.  Engage in extensive work to train the populace. The foundation of the nation lies in the people. Without a strong organization of the people, the nation cannot prosper. Everyone knows this. China has endured thousands of years of autocratic rule. The people only know how to be obedient and regard national affairs as the responsibility of the government. Therefore, how can we rely solely on the government to shoulder the task of saving the nation and seeking survival and resist strong enemies? To understand shame and teach warfare, one must be able to fight for oneself. If the organization of the populace can achieve this, then even if the enemy has strong troops pressing the border, what do we have to fear? Therefore, our efforts to save the nation and seek survival are not without active work. In the future, we should go deep into the grassroots, engage in training and organizing the people, and create a strong foundation for the people. This can not only resist foreign aggression and seek survival but also make traitors disappear. If we move in a unified direction, we can advance on multiple fronts, training and organizing the people of one village in one village, and training and organizing the people of one county in one county. After ten years of growth and training, what do we have to fear that the nation will not prosper? We, the undersigned, encourage ourselves with this principle and also lead tens of thousands of young people in Jiangnan to strive for this goal. As long as we have one breath left, we will surely seek the revival of the Chinese nation and wash away the deep shame. We offer our sincere thoughts, hoping for your consideration. We remain, the Jiangsu Provincial United Association of Secondary Schools, respectfully."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education has already compiled statistics on the number of people currently enrolled in education at all levels and compared it with the national population.

<h3 id="e170">Director Pan Gave a Speech Yesterday at the Short-Term Elementary Education Research Conference, Explaining the Urgency of Short-Term Elementary Schools in China's Current Situation and Hoping that All Teachers Will Integrate Their Profession and Career <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Short-Term Elementary Education Research Conference of this city held its second general meeting at Shangwen Elementary School at 2 PM yesterday. More than 80 representatives from various schools attended. Zhang Zeng'an chaired the meeting, and Huang Fengming recorded the minutes. Regarding the results of various studies, representatives from Wan Zhu, Shangwen, He'an, Meixi, and Xicheng schools were recommended, and Wan Zhu was recommended as the convener. The conference chairman was given a deadline of January 15th to submit the research results to the Education Bureau. Afterwards, Director Pan of the Education Bureau gave a speech, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, today's meeting of the Short-Term Elementary Education Research Conference is taking place, and I have a few words to say to you briefly. The national compulsory education, as stipulated in China, is six years. One should receive six years of education, and if it is absolutely necessary, one should also receive four years of education. However, due to the financial difficulties of the country and the large number of out-of-school children, if we strictly follow the six-year or four-year system, the government may have difficulty raising funds for a while, and it will take a long time for most children to receive education, and we don't know how many years we will have to wait. But when national disasters become serious, we want to get many out-of-school children educated in the shortest time possible, and we must shorten the time limit. Therefore, the Ministry of Education stipulates this temporary emergency measure, which is not a regular method. This is what we should first recognize clearly. Don't think that one year of short-term elementary school is enough. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The second point to make clear is that the one-year short-term elementary school allows out-of-school children to be educated in shifts in a very short period. For example, with the four-year system, a school that can accommodate 200 people can only graduate 200 people in four years. However, with the short-term elementary school system, the same school can teach 200 people every year. Although we cannot make such an accurate calculation, we can at least guarantee that it will double. Therefore, the Ministry of Education stipulates this method, which can allow out-of-school children to receive a superficial education in rotation in the shortest period. The third point is that some people say that the short-term elementary school has too short a time limit and too little teaching material, which is not enough to meet the needs. Indeed, but we don't have to worry about this. One is better than none. Although one year of education is short, it is better than no education at all. Second, we want to make it possible for them to seek further education. Because they can still enter community schools, tutoring schools, or other social education opportunities when they grow up. With this one year of foundation, they can gradually improve in the future. Therefore, short-term elementary school is to give them some tools so that they will have the opportunity to receive further education in the future.</p>
<p>In short, short-term elementary school is to adapt to the current situation that the country is very poor and there are so many out-of-school children. Therefore, there is this flexible method. Then, since short-term elementary school is so necessary, how should we, who are short-term elementary school teachers, do our work? Therefore, everyone is here today to research and discuss, solve difficulties, and seek the progress of teaching effectiveness. However, I can tell you my personal thoughts.</p>
<p>I think that taking on this kind of position is really the country's expectation of you, which is not enough, and the career is important, so this short-term elementary school is set up. Therefore, you must serve under this principle, even if the work is more and the reward is less, and you cannot distinguish the level of teachers. It can be said that your spirit of service to the country and society is better than theirs. Therefore, I hope that everyone will do their best, and the spirit of service must be full, so that you can truly work for the country and society. Second, teaching students in short-term elementary schools is different from ordinary elementary schools. Ordinary elementary schools stipulate age of admission, which is quite neat, and the levels are also very similar. In short-term elementary schools, the ages vary, and the levels are uneven. It is worth noting what methods to use to teach them in the same class and achieve the same results within a certain period. Therefore, special research should be conducted on short-term elementary education for this reason. Third, it is more difficult to be a teacher in a short-term elementary school. For example, recruiting students is more difficult than in ordinary elementary schools. Because the Education Bureau first investigates the number of children in each district who cannot enter ordinary elementary schools, and then distributes short-term elementary schools in each district. Teachers in short-term elementary schools must recruit these children who are unable or have no time to enter ordinary elementary schools, which is the real meaning of running short-term elementary schools. It would be wrong to recruit students who are already studying in ordinary elementary schools. Everyone should pay attention to this point. Therefore, teachers who work in short-term elementary schools must have enthusiasm for the country, society, and children, and a spirit of willingness to sacrifice. Teachers should regard half of their work as a profession and half as a career. Profession and career are different. Profession is to mechanically seek material life, while career is spiritual life. Everyone should integrate profession and career, recognizing that this work is not only a profession for seeking life but also the most noble career for the country and society."</p>

<p>In the International Cup soccer match between China and Russia, the two sides clashed at Shen Garden on Yanping Road at 3 PM yesterday. Most of the Chinese players were from the Donghua team, while the Russian army was based on the Su-Ker army, so in fact it seemed to be Donghua vs. Su-Ker. China was the champion of the previous session, and had defeated the Russian army by a huge score of eleven to one, so the defeat of the Russian army this time was expected by most people. About a thousand people watched the game from the sidelines yesterday. In the first half, the Chinese team's coordination was slightly lacking, and they missed opportunities repeatedly. It was not until the end of the time that Cao Qiuting scored a goal. In the second half, China was slightly more active, and because Russian general Baurudin fouled and was sent off, they took the opportunity to score two goals. The overall result was three to zero, and China triumphed. The details of yesterday's game are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Russian army has courage but no strategy At 3 o'clock, the referee's whistle sounded. The Russian army took the offensive first. Xiao Jia advanced to the frontier, Chen Cang crossed secretly, and short passes and iron legs shot hard at the enemy's goal. The arrow was like lightning, and the goalkeeper punched it out. Dai Zhongjun greeted it with his head, but unfortunately, he used too much force and crossed the goal. After that, our army attacked from the side, stirring up trouble in front of the Russian goal. Kaluoli District, the right wing of the enemy, galloped across the field, and his courage was the champion of the three armies. The five forwards of the Russian army were very courageous and rampant. Unfortunately, they had courage but no strategy, and they were not accurate, so they failed to capture the city. Then Sun Jinshun rose up in the Central Plains, went straight in alone, applied his hard iron legs, and the arrow shot out like an arrow. He was actually caught by the Russian goalkeeper Posevik lying on the ground to save it, which was a pity. The Russian army took advantage of the situation to advance, and the five forwards rolled in, unstoppable. In a blink of an eye, they had entered our army's hinterland. Fortunately, Jiang Shanjing saved the situation and was not killed.</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting opens the record Dai Zhongjun sat in the center and commanded in secret. Sun and Li flanked from left and right. Li Yichen巧sh施调虎孙 Tie Legs raised his foot and shot hard. Baurudin was very clever and temporarily served as the goalkeeper, blocking the incoming ball. Xiao Jia was too late to catch up and could only sigh at the door. Cao Qiu was on the rise again on the frontier, secretly passing Dai Zhongjun, and successively conquered the enemy's defense. He jumped up and kicked, and the ball was driven out by the Russian goalkeeper. The enemy army, Laobiersituofu, was particularly hardworking, breaking through three levels by himself, and transmitting the camera. Fortunately, Apikev was too late to catch up and only forced a corner kick. After a stalemate like this for forty minutes, the ball was intercepted by Dai Zhongjun from under Haifuluofu's feet and passed to Li Yichen, who gently flicked it. Cao Qiu ran up and then kicked, and the ball entered from the corner, opening the record. At the end of the first half, China took the lead with one goal.</p>
<p>Three to zero overcomes Russia After the lemon, the two sides changed places and fought again. The Russian army was determined to break the boat, and the forwards were unusually rampant. As a result, the ball often hovered in our army's position. Fortunately, their feet were crooked and they did not succeed. Dai Linjing took the lead and went to 离门. At the — code, Gala Mountain steals the ball and fouls. Cao Qiuting takes the penalty, but his foot is too soft, and Sun Tie Legs is slightly slow in action, losing a great opportunity again. The Russian army is rough and naturally savage, and its movements are becoming more barbaric. Sun Jinshun and Baurudin competed for the incoming ball and collided with each other. Bao actually waved his arm and used force. Fortunately, the judge ruled that Bao was off the field, and the reward and punishment were fair. The Russian army lost a general and felt more and more unsupported, so they changed from attack to defense in order to consolidate the defense. Our army took advantage of the situation to advance, Dai Linjing dribbled the ball forward, passing from left to right, Sun Jinshun was close to the water tower, took the ball deeply, and kicked it, but it was blocked by Mailings. Cao Qiuting caught up and shot hard, hitting the bullseye. Sun Tie Legs saw that the enemy's defense was idle and took advantage of the opportunity. Sure enough, he saw another miracle. The overall situation of three to zero was set. After that, there were no achievements until the gold was called in. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese team</p>
<p>Xu Heng, Li Ning, Jiang Shanjing, Gu Shangdong, Feng Yunyou, Liu Shizan</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Sun Shun, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Russian team Posevik, Baurudin, Mailings, Stadden Bamboo, Haifuluofu, Gala Mountain</p>

<h3 id="e188">Chinese Central Script Group Football: Railway Tied with Zhenru Three-on-Three Yesterday <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Last year's Chinese Football Association Chinese Script Group champions, the Railway team, played against the Zhenru team in the Chinese Script Group competition at the Mackie Road field yesterday. The remaining ice had just melted, and the ground was as slippery as oil, greatly affecting both sides' progress. In addition, the north wind was strong and sharp, and it was difficult to score with kicks that were easily blown off course. After the start of the game, the Railway team had the upper hand at times, but missed many good opportunities, and instead gave Zhenru a penalty kick opportunity. Shi Yongnan successfully scored one penalty kick, and Wang Sunjing also succeeded. The Railway team used all their strength, and Lu Qifu also scored a goal with a penalty kick, and Liu Ximeng's fierce attack also yielded good results, forcing a 2-2 tie to end the first half. After the lemon break, the Railway team still controlled the situation. Soon, Lu Longfu broke through the defense and scored, but Zhenru's Chen Chunxi immediately created a 3-3 tie. After that, there was no progress for more than ten minutes, and until the end of the game, it was still a 3-3 draw. Railway goalkeeper Li Chuanxin saved many dangerous shots. This team was newly promoted to the Chinese Script Group this season and is still in its initial debut. The overall coordination is still quite skilled, but it is a pity that the kicks are too soft.</p>
<p>Railway Team: Li Chuanxin, Jiang Songhua, Lin Gendu, Yang Shengwu, Huang Jinquan, Zhao Weixian, Feng Songqian, Song Zhenhe, Liu Ximeng, Lu Longfu, Chen Guorui. Zhenru Team: Huang Shideng, Zhang Lianzhuang, Guan Zhiyang, Cai Daojian, Chen Xiu, Lin Tianen, Xu Hongyin, Wang Sunjing, Shi Yongnan, Huang Shihua, Xu Yongpo.</p>

<h3 id="e198">American Monetary Policy and the Anglo-American Currency War <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Sen Yu</p>
<p>———Chinese Currency in a Vice———</p>
<p>Following China's new monetary policy, another significant event has occurred in the world's financial markets in recent days: the sudden and severe drop in silver prices on the London silver market due to the United States' cessation of silver purchases. The market situation became extremely unstable, and trading was even suspended on the tenth of this month, causing an unprecedented disruption since the European War of 1914. Although the United States is still purchasing silver in London, easing concerns somewhat, the market price continues to fall due to the significant difference between the amounts sold and purchased.</p>
<p>A Review of American Silver Policy and its Factors</p>
<p>The initial manifestation of American silver policy was the so-called Thomas Amendment in Part 3 of the Emergency Agricultural Relief and Currency Inflation Act of May 1933. This amendment authorized the President to change the silver dollar's quantity, freely mint coins, adopt a bimetallic system, and receive war debt principal and interest with silver up to a limit of 200 million yuan (but only received 10 million yuan from the UK). Subsequently, there was the London Silver Agreement of July 1933, which was approved in December, followed by the promulgation of the Domestic Silver Purchase Act. The Bitman Amendment in the Gold Reserve Act of January 1934, the Silver Purchase Act of June, and the Silver Nationalization Order of August followed. Among these, the Silver Purchase Act of June 1934 was the most important. It stipulated that currency reserves should be 75% gold and 25% silver, aiming to achieve this ratio by purchasing silver domestically and internationally. It also authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates and empowered the President to order silver to be deposited into the mint, regardless of the owner or location.</p>
<p>The United States' active approach to silver was naturally based on the interests of domestic silver-producing states and the desire to indirectly promote currency inflation. However, focusing solely on domestic reasons is clearly insufficient. In reality, the interests of silver mine owners are not necessarily the most important aspect of the policy. From June 1934 to July of this year, the government purchased 472.2 million ounces of silver in thirteen months. Of this, only 26 million ounces were newly produced domestically, and the remaining 112.2 million ounces purchased from the public were mostly imported from overseas. This shows that the benefits gained by domestic mine owners were not as significant as claimed. To study American silver policy, we should extend it to the international relationship, but if we simply explain it as "increasing the purchasing power of silver-using countries," that is still insufficient. In addition to aiming to increase the consumption capacity of South American and Far Eastern countries by raising silver prices to develop its trade, the United States also attempts to control the currency rights of the above-mentioned countries that use silver standard and gold exchange standard, especially China, to expand the dollar bloc. In summary, silver policy is also a weapon in international financial struggles, and its conflict with the United Kingdom is particularly fierce.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must also discuss the international gold-silver bimetallic system. Recently, there has been a high demand for adopting a bimetallic system, especially from the United States. The motivation for the Americans to advocate for the bimetallic system, in addition to the general theoretical basis of the so-called equilibratory action, is mainly related to the special relationship with silver. The United States not only holds a significant amount of silver itself, but American capital also controls more than 60% of the world's annual silver production. Therefore, restoring silver as a currency and fundamentally resolving its outlet is the most appropriate thing to do. The United States already has a lot of gold, and if it accumulates more silver at the same time, it will control most of the world's gold and silver, allowing it to monopolize resources. In addition to the country, it can also force all countries to uniformly implement a gold-silver bimetallic system, and under the name of the international bimetallic system, manipulate international finance.</p>
<p>The main objectives of American silver policy are listed below:</p>
<p>The Failure of Silver Policy and its New Trends</p>
<p>Given the above objectives of American silver policy, what are the results? Undeniably, apart from the silver mine owners who have indeed profited domestically, the majority of the people still do not benefit. Internationally, the realization of the bimetallic system is still slim. The purchasing power of silver-using countries has not only failed to increase, but has instead deepened their level of panic, causing the purchasing power to shrink even further. China, Mexico, Peru, etc., have suffered the most. Moreover, this has created opportunities for the United Kingdom to expand the gold-pound group's activities.</p>
<p>Based on the above failures, the United States has to reconsider its silver policy to a considerable extent. However, it is difficult to find a solution. It is in a difficult position. Continuing as before is not allowed by the facts, and suddenly abandoning it is neither desirable nor possible. Therefore, the United States has been uneasy in recent months.</p>
<p>However, as of now, the situation has become increasingly tight. In early November, China was forced to change its currency system and announce a new monetary policy due to the urgency of financial panic. In addition, the United Kingdom's activities in the international financial market have been very active recently, which has forced the United States to take necessary countermeasures.</p>
<p>The American strategy finally emerged a few days ago, which is the current change in the London silver market. When the change suddenly occurred, the reasons spread by all parties were complex and confusing, and no one could agree. Some said that the United States intended to purchase silver at a low price to reduce the amount it paid; some said that the amount of silver dumped was too large, and the United States could not absorb it for a while; some said that European cash no longer flows to the United States in large quantities, making the United States unwilling to purchase silver at a high price; some said that a large amount of Chinese silver was smuggled to Japan, and the United States had to come out and crack down on it, etc. These do have considerable relevance, and the last two are undeniable facts. However, these alone are not enough to explain and cannot be considered the main factors of the silver change. We must also pay attention to the unfolding of a new stage of the Anglo-American currency war. (Details below)</p>
<p>As for some people's speculation that this is the prelude to the United States' abandonment of silver policy, I don't think that's necessarily the case. Based on the following points, the United States may not abandon silver: The United States has huge investments in silver mines at home and abroad. If the silver issue is abandoned, it is impossible in practice. The U.S. government has purchased a lot of silver in the past ten months or so. If the silver policy is abandoned halfway, how will these stored silver be disposed of? Silver is still a weapon in the international financial war. If the United States wants to win the world's economic stage, it must still use it. The United States' plan for the international bimetallic system has not been interrupted, and silver is the protagonist of the bimetallic system. If it is negative about silver, the realization of the bimetallic system will be even more hopeless.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that the United States will probably not abandon its silver policy. The problem is just how to implement it. As for the price of silver, unless absolutely necessary, it may not fall indefinitely, because according to the above points, the excessive drop in silver prices has more disadvantages than advantages for the United States itself. Based on recent facts, the future strategy of the United States on silver policy can be roughly speculated as follows: Transfer the center of the international silver market from London to New York to combat the United Kingdom and allow the United States to further manipulate the world's silver. This point has been explained by Finance Minister Morgenthau. Purchase silver directly from the Far East and other places, so as to directly place the finance of those places in the hands of the United States. Make every effort to prevent China from leaving silver, and further encircle China's currency into the dollar bloc. Exchange goods for silver, so that it can directly obtain silver without spending gold, and also promote the sale of surplus products. Representative Thais, a silver faction activist, has reportedly made this claim.</p>
<p>The future success or failure of the above points is another issue. In short, they are roughly the trend of American silver policy in the future. Among them, the most obvious manifestation is the currency challenge against the United Kingdom, and the Anglo-American currency war is nothing more than the fuse of this silver change. This can be a very important proof from the remarks of U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and the remarks of silver faction members such as Thomas Pittman. But here we must also mention China's currency problem. Unfortunately, China's currency is now the target of the new struggle between the dollar and the pound. It is undeniable that the recent currency reform has objectively strengthened the confrontation between the United States and the United Kingdom and launched the new currency war between the two major groups of the dollar and the pound.</p>
<p>(3) The confrontation between the Dollar Bloc and the Pound Bloc</p>
<p>To understand the current situation of the dollar-pound war, we must first understand the lineup of their groups and the situation of past struggles.</p>
<p>Currency is a weapon in the era of financial capitalism to compete for markets. The currency group is a natural product of economic groups, and its combination is more important than general economic groups. Either based solely on the commonality of currency; or based on the common interdependence of currency, that is, taking the mutual dependence of the external value of currency as a link, with the economically superior country exercising economic and even political dominance. The former is like the gold group led by France; the latter is like the pound bloc centered on the United Kingdom and the dollar bloc centered on the United States.</p>
<p>In the current world, only these three can be called huge currency groups. Although Japan is combining with the puppet Manchuria to carry out its Far East currency group, its financial power is still too lacking, and it cannot be global. Even among the above three groups, the gold group can only maintain its "not yet collapsed" state. It is currently in turmoil, and its power is weakening day by day. The position of the franc is also precarious, and its future is unpredictable. Therefore, the most intense competition in the world is only between the dollar and the pound groups. The dollar bloc is led by the United States and includes Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica in Central America, Cuba, Haiti, Santo Domingo in the West Indies, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and the Philippines in South America. The pound bloc is led by the United Kingdom and includes the self-governing colonies and territories of the empire, as well as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Argentina, etc. Although Canada is a British territory, its economic relationship with the United States is particularly close. In 1933, it also followed the United States in devaluing its currency. Some people also include it in the dollar bloc; but the United Kingdom is now trying its best to tighten this ring, using the activities of the Imperial Central Bank to strengthen the relationship between the United Kingdom and Canada and resist the power of the United States. This can also be said to be the target of the dollar and pound blocs' competition.</p>
<p>(4) The War Between the Dollar and the Pound</p>
<p>The history of the international currency war is not short. The specific beginning of the war was the United Kingdom's prohibition of gold exports and abandonment of the gold standard in October 1931. After the gold standard was abandoned, the pound fell sharply. With the stimulus of the exchange rate, the United Kingdom's foreign trade suddenly took the advantage, not only overwhelming European countries, but also encroaching on the commodity markets of Japan and the United States. Then, Japan also abandoned the gold standard. In April 1933, the United States also officially announced the cessation of cash payments, withdrew from the gold standard, and implemented currency devaluation to fight against the United Kingdom and Japan. The struggle between the United States and the pound is even more profound. In the summer of 1933, the London World Economic Conference ended in a breakdown mainly because the United States was unwilling to stabilize exchange rates, and the confrontation between the United States and the United Kingdom was irreconcilable. Since then, the two countries' struggle for currency hegemony has not stopped. On the one hand, they use huge equalization funds to dump exchange rates; on the other hand, they form huge groups and seize the world's financial territory. The United States has not only purchased a large amount of gold from the world, but also formulated the above-mentioned silver policy, announced the Silver Purchase Act, and actively purchased silver.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the United States implemented the silver policy mainly to manipulate the world's silver market and use it as a weapon for international financial struggle, except for a small part based on its domestic motives. It also uses this to control the currencies of countries that use the gold exchange standard and the silver standard, so as to expand the sphere of influence of the dollar bloc. Among them, seizing China's currency is the most important goal; if China's currency joins the dollar bloc, this huge market will not be difficult for the United States to manipulate.</p>
<p>(5) The Anglo-American Currency War in China</p>
<p>The United States' ambition for China's currency rights has been expressed for a long time. The Kemmerer Plan in 1930 was prepared to directly link China's currency unit with the U.S. dollar in order to develop American trade and investment in China; however, this plan was not realized due to various reasons.</p>
<p>After the offensive silver policy was adopted, unfortunately, it caused too much financial panic in China and led to China's discontent. At that time, it was advantageous to the United Kingdom. On the one hand, the United Kingdom secretly carried out planned sabotage, and on the other hand, it pleased China on the surface. It also planned to encircle China's currency into the pound bloc, and China's currency unit followed the pound. At that time, the demand for China to join the pound bloc had begun to rise very high. In order to consider China's trend towards extremism, the United States had to slightly ease its silver purchase procedures.</p>
<p>However, at the beginning of last month, China finally implemented a new monetary policy. Although this policy is not formally joining the pound bloc, it is at least quite beneficial to the United Kingdom. On the American side, it did not generate a good impression. On the contrary, due to the United Kingdom's activity, it clearly expressed displeasure. Therefore, the two countries' currency struggle in China has intensified dramatically in secret.</p>
<p>This time, the United States' reduction of silver purchases in London can also be mainly said to be a manifestation of the beginning of a new stage of the Anglo-American struggle, with China's currency as the target. The leader of the silver faction, Thomas, publicly attacked the United Kingdom, accusing the United Kingdom of absorbing Chinese currency to expand the pound bloc, and clearly stated that the pound bloc is an organization to counter the United States. The United States had to rise up to deal with it. In addition to launching a frontal attack on the United Kingdom, it is also a demonstration by the United States to China; the United States may use the destruction of the Chinese financial market as a threat to directly negotiate with China, demanding a change in the current monetary policy to benefit the United States, and at least to exclude British activities. This development is not impossible; if the Anglo-American struggle in China really reaches a boiling point and triggers a more serious financial storm, the sacrifices made by China in the clamp are really terrible. We cannot absolutely trust excessive optimism, thinking that China's current financial situation is quite stable, and the foreign exchange rate is also stable, and it has the power to break the onslaught of the tide. In essence, although China's currency system has nominally lifted the shackles of silver, it cannot completely get rid of silver after all; China's international payments still have to be calculated in silver. In peacetime, China can stabilize international exchange rates by the unlimited purchase and sale of foreign exchange by the three major banks; however, the fund for trading foreign exchange has not yet been independent from silver. If the silver market changes, it will directly affect the amount of China's stable exchange rate fund. The foreign exchange market situation in the past few days has already revealed the difficulty of maintaining it, and the most severe days are yesterday (20th) and today (21st), and its future is still unpredictable. Some say that the United Kingdom can assist China, and yesterday (20th), HSBC sold long-term contracts, which seems to have the meaning of maintaining foreign exchange; but can the United Kingdom really work hard for China? In fact, it is not just to maintain its own interests! To put it bluntly, it is just using China's currency as a tool to resist the dollar! What good will it ultimately do for China?</p>
<p>Naturally, on the other hand, we may be able to find a temporary compromise point between the United States and the United Kingdom; that is, when the struggle between the two sides develops to a certain stage, there may be a temporary truce (but it is only temporary). Based on the United Kingdom's current situation, it may reconcile with the United States, be willing to negotiate with the United States, sign an agreement on economic interests in China, or obtain the United States' cessation of offensive with other exchange conditions (such as Anglo-American cooperation in the naval conference, etc.). At the same time, it seems that the United States may not necessarily be tough to the end. If the entire Chinese market is too chaotic, it will also be detrimental to American trade and investment; and the dramatic changes in silver prices, as mentioned above, will also have adverse effects on its domestic situation; in addition, it often harms Central and South American countries, which is indirectly harming the United States. Therefore, if it can obtain certain concessions from the United Kingdom, it is not impossible to compromise. However, who will be the main sacrificial object of this compromise?</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Current State of Shandong Fisheries and its Improvement (Continued) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Fengbai</p>
<p>The Fisheries of Qingdao, Shandong Under Japanese Control</p>
<p>The encroachment of Japanese fishing power into Shandong is not a recent phenomenon. More than a decade ago, the Japanese presence in Shandong's fishing industry was already exceptionally large. The two major fish-producing areas of Shandong – Weihaiwei and Qingdao – were already under Japanese control and manipulation. The main reason for this was that the Japanese were able to utilize the most advanced and modern fishing tools and methods, backed by political power. Our old-fashioned fishing industry was naturally unable to compete, and therefore, its decline and decay were inevitable.</p>
<p>The earliest Japanese fishing presence in Shandong Province was undoubtedly in Qingdao. We can say that Qingdao was the headquarters of Japanese fishing in Shandong. It is recorded that the Japanese came to Qingdao to fish starting in 1914, when they seized Qingdao from the Germans. At that time, due to various conveniences granted by our government, the number of Japanese fishing boats in Qingdao increased from 108 to more than 130 between 1915 and 1917, with the number of fishermen peaking in 1916, totaling 561. By 1918, the number of fishing boats had decreased to 93, and the number of fishermen had decreased to 440. According to a survey by the Japanese consulate in Qingdao in 1925, there were 49 resident fishermen and 309 fishing laborers. In 1928, according to a municipal survey, there were a total of 34 Japanese fishing boats, including 30 large sailing vessels and 4 small motorboats, with a total of 300 fishermen. According to recent surveys, there are 45 Japanese fishing boats in Qingdao, including 38 large sailing vessels and 7 diesel-powered vessels, with 500 fishermen. They reside in Qingdao year-round, engage in fishing, and have organized the Qingdao Aquatic Products Cooperative as their marketing agency. (Note 11)</p>
<p>It should also be noted here: why has the number of Japanese fishing boats decreased from 108 to 45? Does this indicate that Japanese fishing in Qingdao is gradually declining? Of course not! Because Japan's recent fishing operations in Shandong have Qingdao as the center between the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, and Weihaiwei as the center between the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea. In the past, they focused solely on Qingdao, but now, in addition to Qingdao as a base, they are also developing towards the Weihaiwei area. Therefore, in Qingdao, they have inevitably had to slightly divert some of their fishing power; but this does not prove that Japanese fishing in Qingdao has declined. On the contrary, it precisely proves that Japanese fishing has developed from Qingdao to all fish-producing areas of Shandong.</p>
<p>The most commonly caught fish by the Japanese in Qingdao is Spanish mackerel. Spanish mackerel are caught using fly fishing. Every spring, the larger Japanese ships sail to the Spanish mackerel fishing grounds of Haizhou, while the smaller boats operate near Mount Shuiling and Dagong Island. In summer, the range is wider, and in autumn, they are mostly in the vicinity of Dalian Island and Thousand Li Island... It is estimated that each large ship catches about 7,000 yuan worth of fish annually, and even in lean years, they catch about 2,000 yuan worth. Besides Spanish mackerel, the next most common fish is swordfish, which is most abundant in Shazikou, Taixi Town. In 1915, 18 fishing boats came from Oita Prefecture in Japan, followed by 10 boats from Dalian. Since then, several boats have come and gone every year. If there are fewer Spanish mackerel in summer, they catch eel, and when the hairtail fish scatter in autumn, they catch Spanish mackerel. At the beginning of each fishing season, the Japanese use Dagong Island, Mount Shuiling, Shazikou, Rongshan... as fishing grounds. At the peak of the fishing season, the area near Thousand Li Island is the most prosperous; at the end of the fishing season, some also venture far to Laoshan Bay or south to Dalian Island. It is estimated that each boat catches about 700 to 1,300 yuan worth of fish annually. Sharks are very useful; their fins are dried to make shark fins, their bones can be used to make utensils, their meat can be salted and dried for food, their skin can be boiled into glue or made into meat wings, and their livers can be rendered into oil to make candles. Therefore, the Japanese make huge profits, totaling tens of thousands of yuan annually.</p>
<p>As for the capture of flounder and halibut, each boat can catch at least 500 yuan worth of fish in each fishing season; each boat can also catch about 500 yuan worth of sea bass in each fishing season. In addition, the Japanese also use diving equipment to catch abalone and sea cucumber, with each boat earning 1,800 yuan, and up to 2,000 yuan or more. According to a survey from 1932, the total amount of fish caught by the Japanese in Qingdao was 3,965,264 guan (each guan is equal to 100.5335 taels), valued at 1,955,708 yuan. (Note 12) Shandong has lost such good fishing rights. Can the future of its fishing industry still be asked about?</p>

<p>Plans for Reforming Shandong's Fishing Industry</p>
<p>From the above sections, it can be seen that the output of Shandong's fishing industry is indeed remarkable. Although it has now reached a state of decline and decay, it is not too late to catch up and find ways to save it. In recent years, the Shandong Provincial Department of Construction, in order to rectify the coastal fishing industry in Shandong, has issued many measures for salvation, but most of them focus on treating the symptoms while neglecting the root cause. Therefore, the Department stated in its plan for rectifying the coastal fishing industry in Shandong: "...The fishing industry is now on the verge of bankruptcy. If we do not immediately seek to treat the symptoms to maintain the current situation, it will be even more difficult to save in the future..." So what are their methods? "...For the present, we can expand this place and change it into a Fisheries Protection Bureau, temporarily purchase two protection warships to prevent pirates, establish fish markets to avoid exploitation by fish merchants, and establish fishermen's loan offices to facilitate fishermen's turnover..."</p>
<p>These methods can be said to focus on treating the symptoms. In other words, they are effective ways to save Shandong's endangered fishing industry. However, this is not enough, because treating the symptoms is a temporary measure. If we do not address the root cause, treating the symptoms will lose its basis. Even if it can achieve considerable results, its effect will be minimal. Therefore, I advocate that treating the root cause and treating the symptoms should be carried out simultaneously. We should thoroughly reform Shandong's fishing industry from the root cause, and strive to maintain the current situation and implement salvation strategies from the perspective of treating the symptoms. Focusing solely on treating the root cause or solely emphasizing treating the symptoms are not perfect solutions.</p>
<p>Today, if we want to implement a plan to reform Shandong's fishing industry, we must first understand the reasons for the decline of Shandong's fishing industry. Only by implementing methods to address both the root cause and the symptoms can we achieve both goals. The reasons for the decline of Shandong's fishing industry can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Squeezed out by Japanese fisheries. The Japanese have recently used Dalian as a fishing base and used modern fishing nets to frequently cross the border to fish in the coastal areas of Shandong. Every fishing season, they come in groups. Shandong fishermen, due to the disparity in strength, retreat one after another, so the good fishing opportunities are seized by others.</p>
<p>Looting by bandits. In recent years, the rural economy in Shandong has been devastated, and many unemployed fishermen have gathered into gangs, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. They are nominally fishing, but in reality, they specialize in looting wealth and stealing nets, and even sinking people into the sea and sailing away, or threatening fishermen to pay a certain amount of money every year.</p>
<p>Exploitation by fish merchants. In the coastal ports of Shandong, except for Qingdao, which has a commercially-run fish market, the rest are managed by fish merchants who monopolize fish prices, manipulate the market, deduct commissions, and practice high-interest exploitation. Fishermen feel great pain and can do nothing about it, causing the fishing economy to be extremely panicked.</p>
<p>Conservative and outdated methods, unaware of improvement. Shandong fishermen, due to economic difficulties, ignorance, and lack of ability to improve, use fishing gear and methods that have been inherited for many years. Competing with foreigners is undoubtedly a failure. Therefore, fishermen's livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult, and imported marine products are becoming increasingly large. Except for a few Jianglun boats that can still support themselves, more and more poor fishermen are changing their professions to make a living. This has further pushed Shandong's fishing industry to the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I believe that strengthening ourselves is the best creed for reforming Shandong's fishing industry today. The reasons for the decline of Shandong's fishing industry over the years should be considered from the perspective of our own reform, rather than attributing it to external pressure and dumping of foreign goods. To reform Shandong's fishing industry, we should start with the following aspects:</p>
<p>Establish a Fisheries Protection Bureau. The establishment of this bureau is dedicated to managing the administrative affairs of the fishing industry in the entire province, leading all technical matters, developing aquatic products, improving manufacturing, and protecting the safety of fishermen. Fishing is a major economic source in Shandong, and there should be a specialized agency to design and manage it. If it is still under the jurisdiction of the Department of Construction, there will often be problems of insufficient attention to affairs. Over the years, Shandong's fishing industry, with the exception of Qingdao, has mostly lacked a specialized agency to manage it. Everything is left to its own devices. External aggression has not been negotiated, and internal organization lacks a high-level agency to supervise and improve it. Therefore, the establishment of a Fisheries Protection Bureau is necessary at present.</p>
<p>Establish a Fisheries Police Force. This is specifically designed to defend against pirates and unreasonable aggression by foreign fishing boats. Roughly, the fishing grounds along the coast of Shandong should be permanently stationed with police forces to provide defense, so that fishermen can be protected and not suffer more external losses. The management of this police force should preferably be directly subordinate to the jurisdiction of the Fisheries Protection Bureau, so as to facilitate direct command.</p>
<p>Build fishing ports. Because fishing ports have a close relationship with the fishing industry, fishing ports are the base of the fishing industry. They not only provide many conveniences for the transportation, sale, processing, and storage of fish catches, but also are necessary for the construction, mooring, and repair of fishing boats, the production and repair of fishing gear, the avoidance of wind disasters, and the supply of various necessities for fishing operations.

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, banks were not receiving settlements as usual, the financial market remained sluggish, and market transactions were sparse. The overnight interest rate remained the same as the previous day, at one jiao in the morning and afternoon. Interbank bill trading saw 3.2 million yuan transferred in the morning, with 300,000 yuan in new transactions. Afternoon trading saw 2 million yuan recorded, and the Small General Association traded over 600,000 yuan. Private banks received over 45 million yuan in settlement drafts for foreign public bills, and remittances from various routes totaled over 500,000 yuan. In auxiliary currency trading, only 25,000 jiao of Guangdong small silver coins were traded in the morning market, with an off-market rate of 1.14 yuan, a slight increase of 0.002 yuan from the previous day. 22,500 strings of copper coins were traded, equivalent to 7,500 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Securities: Bullish Sentiment Emerges in the Bond Market Last Week; Returns Slightly Up 0.2-1.56 Yuan <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Last week, from December 16th to December 21st, the market conditions at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange deteriorated due to adverse environmental factors and an oversupply of chips, leading to a reaction and a downward trend. The rumors of bond prices reaching 90% of face value collapsed and dissipated. The bulls who had been shorting aggressively emerged, using Jinbang as their proxy. First, No. 34 began selling, followed by Nos. 69 and 78. Most of them adhered to a consistent strategy. While this was a rational trend, it was also a reaction to the previous price increases. Furthermore, with the settlement date approaching and tight credit conditions, large-scale trading was difficult. Therefore, many believed that No. 78, which had reduced its exposure in this month, would inevitably have to deliver the goods but would ultimately be forced to dump them. Troubles in North China, the approaching New Year, and excessively high chip prices were all factors contributing to the downward trend. As for the future, with only one day left in this month, there might be a temporary short squeeze due to the continuous shorting in recent days, but it is ultimately feared that there will be no power to raise prices. Over the past week, troop increases in North China on Monday led to Jinbang starting to emerge and reducing their positions steadily, while the rest rose slightly from 0.2 to 1 yuan. On Tuesday, Jinbang switched to selling through No. 34, and the troop reduction also fell slightly by over 1 yuan at one point, but those covering short positions were also quite enthusiastic. The market saw more declines than rises. On Wednesday, most of the major players emerged. Because the current price of Zhengliu was relatively high, the bulls first sold off as much as possible, falling by over 1 yuan alone. On Thursday, there were many swap transactions, and the market conditions were erratic, with most of the front-month positions falling and the back-month positions rising, with fluctuations ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 yuan. On Friday, the troop reduction emerged, with Nos. 35 and 69 selling one after another, falling by 2.2 yuan alone, and the rest also fell by several jiao to over 1 yuan due to short squeezes. There were rumors of reducing bond interest rates. On Saturday, the troop reduction fell again, then quickly rebounded slightly. There was a slight short squeeze on the surface, and the market price gradually rose, slightly better by 0.3 to over 1 yuan. Even if there is a rebound in the future, it will still be difficult to stabilize. As a result of the weekly market prices, the total number of transactions was 15,417 million yuan, ranging from 0.2 to 1.56 yuan. A comparison of the resulting gains and losses is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e205">Birds Naming Themselves <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhezun)</p>
<p>There are poems from the Tang Dynasty about mountain birds naming themselves. Paying close attention, it is indeed not a mistake. For example, magpies and sparrows, their calls seem to carry the sound of the word "magpie"; the crow's call seems to carry the sound of the word "crow"; the myna's call seems to carry the sound of the word "myna." As for other birds, such as the cuckoo, which calls "Cut wheat, plant rice, better to return," they are all calling out their own names, blurting them out. I believe that birds are inherently ignorant and simply produce natural sounds. How could they understand how to call themselves by name? An ancient person also wrote a line, "A forest of bird language misses divination with poetry." My humble opinion is that the various birds must have existed first, and when Cangjie created the characters, he listened to the calls of the various birds, copied and depicted them, and then determined their names. Therefore, the names could match the reality. Mencius said, "In the time of Yao, the flood raged, and the paths of beasts and birds crossed in China." This shows that when humans first came into being, birds and animals were also produced at the same time. Therefore, Cangjie's creation of characters was also based on pre-existing things, and then a combination of indication and pictography was made.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Father's Pigeons <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zhen</p>
<p>Recently, my father bought two pigeons from somewhere. These pigeons have feathers as white as rice flour, and a pair of blood-red eyes, as if inlaid with a pair of rubies. They are very beautiful and intelligent, and their parents have given them a pair of strong wings, which further enhances their health and beauty.</p>
<p>On the first day, they recognized their home, food trough, water basin, and their loving owner.</p>
<p>Every day when my father returned from the office, he would lean against the window and silently watch the pair of things. Sometimes, he would sprinkle a handful of grains in the food trough, and the always content pigeons would always fly over "dodo dodo," whether standing on the wall or on the roof. My father named them "Abai." "Abai" was very obedient and often flew to stand in front of my father. But when my father raised his hand to stroke their adorable white feathers, they would "flap flap flap" and fly away.</p>
<p>"Abai" was very good at acting cute, so my father loved them even more.</p>
<p>This time, my father went to Beijing for business, and the pigeons were entrusted to me. I was very worried that they would run away one day. In his first letter, he asked about the family and also specifically mentioned Abai's living conditions. My father also said that if Abai were not too young, he would take them as long-term travel companions. Perhaps this letter could be brought by Abai, which would be even more secure and faster than registered mail.</p>
<p>My father's treatment of Abai can be said to be meticulous. I wonder if Abai's heart has retained my father's impression?</p>
<h3 id="e207">Duck <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Jiaoxin</p>
<p>Ducks were called "wu" in ancient times; those smaller than ducks are called "fu," and "fu" are wild ducks.</p>
<p>Nanjing's "pressed duck" is famous, but in fact, Nanjing's production is not very large, and most of it comes from the Qinghuai area north of the Yangtze River. It is said that the annual sales of ducks are over 40 million, and at 8 jiao per duck, the annual cost is 32 million yuan. This figure is quite alarming. Some people say that if the money spent on eating ducks were used to buy airplanes, 320 airplanes could be bought, which would have some effect on national defense. This is certainly true, but on the other hand, what about the people who rely on it for a living?</p>
<p>According to traditional Chinese medicine, ducks are extremely cold in nature and are the mother of malaria, so those suffering from "gentleman's disease" (a euphemism for malaria) should never eat them.</p>
<p>In Qidong County, Jiangsu, when inviting guests, it is customary to offer the duck's head to the guest of honor. When asked why, they are also mystified, but it is simply a custom that has been passed down.</p>
<p>There are two small glands in the duck's anus that are said to have the fragrance of pine nuts, so many people like to eat them, but I have never dared to try them.</p>
<h3 id="e208">God's Spoiled Children <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>When the revolutionary army first came, women rushed to cut their hair. At that time, women who cut their hair were called "duck's butt." This is very similar in shape! (Nanjing constructs "two-way fur," but I don't know where the meaning comes from.)</p>
<p>Although ducks are not often seen in poetry, the memorable one is "Spring river water warms, ducks know first." As for the two words "duck stove," they are often seen, because ancient incense burners were duck-shaped, so the word "duck" was used in conjunction.</p>
<p>Ducks are fat and bloated, and they waddle when they walk, with a great deal of gentlemanly demeanor.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Wild Duck <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Xiafei</p>
<p>Wild ducks, also known as "jiu" or "water ducks," are said to be nourishing to yin. Therefore, in winter, those who live near Taihu Lake mostly rely on catching wild ducks for a living. Because wild ducks are a delicacy in their hometown, in winter, almost every high-end wine and dinner banquet will have one such dish; and some people also give ducks with their feathers as gifts to relatives and friends. As for the price, it is about half a yuan per jin. Although this number does not seem very expensive to us, it is really considered unusual in a poor and remote rural area with a very low standard of living. Now I will write down the methods of catching and cooking them:</p>
<p>Catching: Wild ducks are good at flying, so catching them is not easy, but in my hometown, I know three kinds: Firing with a shotgun. But this method is not used by many, because once lead bullets are left in the wild duck's meat, the flavor will lose its freshness, and you have to be careful not to damage your teeth with the lead bullets when eating. Catching with a net. However, this method is very troublesome; you must first catch a small wild duck and raise it together with your own domestic duck. When it grows up, cut off the tips of its wing feathers so that it can fly but not soar. In this way, with some training, you can then spread a net on the lake, put some grains in the net's area, and put the "duck decoy" in the middle to let it jump freely. When a flock of wild ducks flies past, it will also fly around the edge of the net, so some wild ducks will often be lured into the net. At that time, the catcher, who is lurking in the reed mat, can close the net door, turning many active wild ducks into prisoners in his net. It is to use "fairy traps"; they are a few bamboo strips and a ramie rope. They arrange ten or twenty bamboo bows with a spring mechanism in the reed mat overnight, put some food on the spring mechanism, and go to retrieve them early the next morning. Then one or two pairs of wild ducks will be caught in these dozens of fairy traps.</p>
<p>Cooking: If you want to eat wild duck, you should know about the cooking of wild duck; because wild ducks are not like domestic ducks, they often live in water and eat fish and shrimp, so they have a very heavy fishy smell, especially when plucking feathers. - Wild duck feathers should be plucked dry and not moistened. The soft feathers and blood vessel feathers should be plucked clean, and no feather stubs should be left behind. Then you can put them in water to open the belly. However, there are also two ways to cook them, but it depends on the personality and preferences of the person eating them: Stir-fry with shepherd's purse, with shredded meat or pure duck. Buy half a jin of pork and stuff it in a duck's belly, then stew it in a wok over charcoal fire, but you need to put more wine. It's best to eat it while it's hot. Not only does reheating taste inferior, but the fishy smell is unbearable.</p>

<p>— (Ziwei)</p>
<p>Chickens are domestic fowl, with two wings and two feet. Everyone knows this, but it is strange to have a chicken with four wings.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I visited the Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing. After admiring the brocade carp and red maples, I encountered a chicken coop. In the middle was a rooster with plump, brocade feathers. At first glance, it was no different from ordinary chickens, but upon closer inspection, there were long hairs like brooms between its feet, and two wings were growing between them. They were displayed all day long, just like a fan, yellow in color, and slightly smaller than the original two wings. Is this a deformed development among chickens?</p>
<p>According to Mr. Someone, a receptionist at the farm, this chicken was given as a special gift by Mr. Shen, the director of the Yuhang Pasture of the Hangzhou West Lake Milk Company. Since the arrival of the four-winged chicken at the park, people from far and wide have flocked to see it, and everyone praised it for its uniqueness.</p>

<p>Chapter 22: Heroic Words Move Painted Lips, Beautiful Women Gather to Discuss; False Affection Startles Jade Wrists, Suffering Woman Flees Imprisonment</p>
<p>This sudden turn of events captivated Bei Hai, making him unable to resist following them to see what would happen. He quickly ran to the front hall, sat down at the table where newspapers were kept, and while pretending to flip through the newspapers, he kept his eyes fixed on the window of that room. He saw Mrs. Zhou and Mrs. Liu both leaning sideways, sitting by the window, while Jia Duocai was sitting on the bed, his face turned slightly away from the window. Just by looking at the two deep wrinkles slanting down his cheeks, one could tell that he was extremely displeased, constantly displaying a forced smile to his guests. The young Mrs. Yueying was sitting there, but not visible. He only heard Mrs. Liu say, "Of course, you both are willing. But the woman's willingness is just a facade, isn't it?" Jia Duocai laughed, "It's good that you all can say that. Anyway, I'm not forcing her to marry me." Mrs. Liu's shrill voice rose a little higher as she said, "Although you're not forcing her to marry you, you've treated her like a prisoner since she married you. Even her grandmother, who longs to see her granddaughter and is near death, you don't let her out to meet her. This is only the beginning of her being in your house, and you're already treating her like this. In the future, when you take her away from this place, won't you devour her alive? So, for the sake of humanity, we can't help but stand up and save her life." Jia Duocai laughed, "You're exaggerating. I have no grudge against Miss Zhu, why would I want her life?" Mrs. Liu said, "If you continue like this, it's worse than killing her with a knife. You're simply cutting her flesh bit by bit." Just then, a sobbing sound was heard, as someone cried out. But the crying didn't last long and stopped immediately. Mrs. Zhou said, "Don't cry. Now that we're here talking to you, we'll definitely come up with a solution." Mrs. Liu said, "Mr. Jia, you see, she can't help but cry when we get to this point. This is definitely not something she can fake. She's only with you because she has no other choice. If you keep her locked up, she'll suffocate to death." Jia Duocai didn't say anything, but sat there with a sullen face. (381)</p>

<h3 id="e212">On Peacocks <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— By the Master of the Paper Curtain and Bronze Vase Studio</p>
<p>Among feathered creatures, few are as outstanding as the peacock. Its form is somewhat like a pheasant, with a body length of over three feet and short, small wings. The male is particularly magnificent, with long tail feathers adorned with golden and emerald green patterns in the shape of eyes, arranged on the upper part, extremely dazzling. It is native to tropical regions, and those raised in our country's gardens are mostly imported from the Indian archipelago and Siam.</p>
<p>The introduction of peacocks into our country dates back very early. The "Yi Zhou Shu" says, "People from afar present peacock birds." In ancient times, it was mentioned alongside geese and kingfishers. The "Tai Xuan Jing" says, "The etiquette of peacocks and geese can be emulated," with a note saying, "Geese fly in formation, and peacocks also form lines." The "Comprehensive Mirror" says, "In the first year of Zhongxing during the reign of Emperor He of Qi, gold and silver were used to make armor, decorated with peacock and kingfisher feathers," with a note saying, "peacock and kingfisher feathers." There is also a saying that peacocks mate with snakes, as the "Nan Yue Zhi" says, "Peacocks do not necessarily pair up for mating, they can conceive simply by connecting through sound and shadow, similar to mating with snakes." "Mao Ting Ke Hua" says, "Snakes mate with peacocks, and some obtain their eggs. If a chicken incubates them, they hatch, and the offspring is called 'Duhu'."</p>
<p>Regarding the method of catching peacocks, it is said that "Peacocks take great pleasure in their tails. Whenever they want to perch on a mountain, they must first choose a place to put their tails, and then stop. Those who catch them often wait for heavy rain, when the tail becomes heavy with rain and cannot fly high. Even if people arrive, the peacock loves its tail and fears it will be injured, so it no longer flies. The catcher can then capture it."</p>
<p>The phrase "chosen from the peacock screen" refers to this bird acting as a matchmaker. However, there are also instances of the same species acting as matchmakers. The "Bei Hu Lu" says, "Tame peacocks are used to lure wild peacocks, called 'peacock matchmakers'."</p>
<p>Peacocks enjoy dancing, no less than modern fashionable women. "Ji Wen" says, "When peacocks hear the sounds of pipes and songs, they must stretch their wings and tails, glancing around and dancing." "Hua Duan" says, "The Kingdom of Silla presented dancing peacocks. Emperor Dezong summoned Bian Guang at Zhenwu Gate to paint their portraits." "Yi Wu Zhi" says, "Peacocks dance when people clap their hands." "Jin Gong Qing Zan" says, "During the reign of Emperor Shizu, the Western Regions presented peacocks that could understand human speech and dance to the beat of finger-snapping." Li Fang's poem says, "Peacocks dance in pairs to welcome the sun."</p>
<p>There are many different names for peacocks, such as Zhong Hui's "Ode to the Peacock," which says, "There is a magnificent bird from the fiery region." "Ben Cao" says, "The peacock is also called Yue Wu." Shi Zhen said, "Kong means 'large'." In Sanskrit, it is called Mayura. "Tan Yuan" says, "Li Xun kept five birds, and called the peacock 'Southern Guest'."</p>
<p>"Mi Zang Ji" says, "The Peacock King Mother Bodhisattva holds an open lotus in her left hand and a peacock tail in her right." This is because peacocks have long been known as having nine virtues, which Buddhism uses to symbolize the conduct of monks.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw in the lost book "Hua Jian" that "Emperor Huizong ordered scholars to paint peacocks ascending a pier as screen decorations, but was greatly displeased. He then ordered the remaining sons to submit their best work, but even those who put in their utmost effort were not used. They then pointed to the emperor and pleaded, and the emperor's decree said, 'Whenever a peacock ascends a pier, it must first use its left foot. All of your paintings show it using its right foot first.' Upon verification, this was indeed the case, and all were convinced by the emperor's exquisite understanding of things."</p>
<p>Peacocks spread their wings when they see people wearing beautiful clothes, which is commonly called "opening the screen." I once visited Hanbi Villa in Wumen. Peacocks were kept in a large cage. When a beautifully dressed young woman gracefully walked past them, the peacocks seemed unwilling to hide their beauty, and spread their magnificent feathers, their intricate patterns shimmering, resembling the changing colors of clouds and mist, which was admired as a spectacle.</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, peacock feathers were used as decorations on the back of official hats, similar to the ancient practice of wearing sable tails. Initially, this was done to reward meritorious service, and only those who had made significant contributions and received special favor were granted the honor of wearing them. After the Xianfeng era, the practice became abused, and a system of purchasing peacock feathers was established. As a result, officials of the fifth rank and above could purchase them, and they were no longer highly valued. However, the wearing of double-eyed peacock feathers by senior officials was still a sign of special favor. Triple-eyed peacock feathers could only be worn by princes and beiles, and were considered as valuable as a bestowed yellow riding jacket. A previous poem says, "The hat flutters with peacock feathers in the gentle breeze, the goose-yellow robe is imbued with imperial aura," referring to this.</p>
<p>There is a so-called peacock flower, likely named for its similar shape. The "Nan Yue Bi Ji" says, "In Qiongzhou, there is a peacock flower," and a poem about the summer heat says, "The linen garment is half-untied as sweat flows, freezing to death the peacock flower in the shade of the wall." The flower thrives in shade and dampness, and brings a chill when facing it, hence the saying. There is also a so-called malachite, which is bright green and shiny, with those whose patterns resemble peacock tails being considered most valuable, used as decorations for hairpins and bracelets. The powdered form can be used for eye treatments.</p>
<p>"Peacocks have gold and emerald feathers, which grow in early spring and wither after March or April, withering and flourishing together with the calyx." This is seen in "Pi Ya." "Peacock feathers stick together when dragon brain is applied, as things of the same kind are attracted to each other," seen in "Qun Zhuang Man Lu." "Peacocks chirp in harmony to greet the morning," seen in "Yi Wu Zhi." "The Yunnan region produces peacocks, which often fly in pairs and leave after more than a month," seen in "Hua Yang Guo Zhi." All of the above statements have not been mentioned by modern zoologists and can be used for research.</p>
<p>Ancient people often praised peacocks with famous lines, such as Han Yu's, "Emerald horns stand tall and uniquely, golden flowers shimmer in contrast." Pi Rixiu says, "Forcibly listening to purple birds, they often want to dance, sleepily leaning on red trees, resembling relying on a screen." Li Ying says, "A body of gold and emerald cannot be painted, few come from ten thousand mountains and rivers." Xue Neng says, "Once lived in the mountains, truly hidden by mist, every time passing under the court, resembling the arrival of spring," all of which are worth reciting.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Sanitary Facilities in the Improved Rural Area of Shanghai Suburbs   Xiao Shi <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Poverty, ignorance, and disunity are the biggest causes of rural bankruptcy. However, poverty can be addressed with various proactive methods, ignorance can be combatted with education, and disunity can be resolved through political organization. But physical weakness and lack of mental energy are far more influential. They prevent the use of brainpower for learning, physical strength for bearing burdens, and spare energy for serving society. Thus, farmers' lack of hygiene and proneness to illness are a major contributor to rural bankruptcy. Here are some key points:</p>
<p>Farmers who are weak and often sick spend a great deal of money on superstition each year. They would even borrow money or pawn their clothes to indulge in their superstitious dreams. When sick, they naturally cannot work, and without work, there is no production. How can farmers who rely on labor for a living withstand prolonged idleness? Add to this the cost of medical treatment, and if misfortune strikes and someone dies, even a middle-class farming family can be ruined. The situation is even worse for the poor. These are just the tangible aspects. The intangible losses are countless. From this, it is clear that the need for hygiene in rural areas is extremely urgent. I will now present a summary of the sanitary facilities in the improved rural area of the Shanghai suburbs, organized by the China Vocational Education Society, for reference by those interested in rural sanitation work.</p>
<p>Training Sanitary Personnel: Rural sanitation in our country is still in its infancy, and there is a severe lack of sanitary personnel. The government, constrained by financial resources, cannot address the sanitation needs of remote areas. Doctors, due to living conditions, are rarely able to penetrate deep into rural areas. The only solution is to provide adequate sanitary training to personnel already working in rural areas to spread sanitary practices. Recognizing this, the area has established a sanitary training class, where all working colleagues in the area and local youth gather for a full day of training each week. Sanitary knowledge, first aid procedures, prevention methods, and basic medicine are thoroughly taught by specialized doctors, with practical exercises included. This continuous and indefinite training will invisibly increase the number of people with sanitary knowledge in the 45-square-mile area by dozens, enabling them to handle sanitation work in the area. This is a cost-effective method for poor management.</p>
<p>Implementing Sanitary Education: The high incidence of disease and the prevalence of superstition among farmers are due to a lack of sanitary knowledge. Medical treatment is a temporary solution, while education is a fundamental remedy. Focusing solely on medical treatment without paying attention to sanitary education is like abandoning the root and chasing the branch. The method of education is to first add sanitary courses to all primary schools in the area, imparting knowledge, correcting habits, checking for deficiencies, treating diseases, and guiding simple treatments. In this way, all primary school students in the area will have some sanitary knowledge. At the same time, opportunities are maximized in public education venues to universally teach daily sanitary matters, especially paying attention to women, as women who understand sanitation can manage household hygiene.</p>
<p>Emphasizing Prevention Work: In urban areas, vaccinations are administered in spring and autumn, and prevention measures are taken against cholera and malaria in summer. Therefore, infectious diseases are less common than in rural areas. The greatest goal of sanitation is to prevent diseases before they occur. Treating them after they have already occurred is like digging a well when already thirsty, the worst of strategies. However, how can prevention work be implemented in remote areas? The high mortality rate among rural residents is not without reason. Seeing this, they have paid special attention to the prevention of infectious diseases over the past year. Satisfactory results have been achieved in the prevention of smallpox and cholera. However, the prevention of malaria is more complex and costly, and there are no adequate methods. This year, the incidence of malaria in the Shanghai-Minhang Road area is particularly severe, with patients accounting for more than 30% of the population. The discovery of malignant malaria is even more dangerous. Faced with this situation, their concerns are even greater. Currently, a location has been designated to implement blood testing and fundamental treatment methods, with efforts primarily focused on mosquito control. From this, the importance of disease prevention can be further understood.</p>
<p>Promoting Public Health: Public places in inland areas not only lack sanitary facilities but also exhibit unsanitary phenomena, which can lead to terrible epidemics. However, rural residents lack sanitary knowledge, and public health is not on their minds. The only way to change customs is through the power of education, while also helping them improve all facilities. For example, open-air pits everywhere are the main breeding grounds for flies, so measures are taken to improve them. Filthy garbage heaps are the source of infectious diseases, so more trash cans are set up. Unclean public water buckets can harm the health of all villagers, so their equipment is improved, and public rules are established to limit usage. In addition, floating coffins in the fields and the rotting corpses of animals along the roads are strictly prohibited. By doing so, rural public health will be generally good. They are currently working hard on these aspects and are establishing public health demonstration areas in appropriate locations within the area as models for various villages, with considerable success, which has been praised by domestic and foreign health experts. I believe that if public health can be managed successfully, it will definitely increase the well-being of the public.</p>
<p>Treating Diseases: Many rural residents are poor and cannot afford to hire doctors or buy medicine. They often have no choice but to seek help from the divine and end up dying untreated. Therefore, treating diseases is still extremely important at present. Currently, there is one clinic and three simple clinics in the area, as well as seven simple pharmacies. Rural residents can seek treatment nearby when they are sick. There is no need for consultation fees, and medicine is provided to the poor. With the help of the Shanghai Suburban Advancement Association's Health Committee, specialized doctors provide guidance on treatment methods and resolve all difficult problems each week, benefiting the public greatly.</p>
<p>When the area began its work last year, it started with medicine, followed by all sanitation work. Subsequently, the promotion of other projects proceeded smoothly without obstacles. The importance of rural sanitation is evident. The facts tell us that rural sanitation is extremely urgent. If efforts can be made in sanitation, it can reduce public illness, increase productive capacity, and strengthen public physique, thereby promoting patriotism. Therefore, rural revitalization and national rejuvenation are directly and indirectly related to sanitation work.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Amidst the Anti-Tuberculosis Voice, Our Understanding of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Part 2) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhihe</p>
<p>Since the severity of pulmonary tuberculosis is so great, we must make proper plans to prevent it in advance. If we have already been infected, we should find ways to treat it properly so that our nation of the sick will not be destroyed by tuberculosis. Therefore, I will list the prevention and treatment methods as follows, which I believe the readers are eagerly waiting to read.</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>(A) Stopping Spitting: Since sputum is the most important cause of tuberculosis transmission, stopping spitting should be dealt with strictly and urgently. This is because sputum is spat everywhere, and through the flying of dust, it unintentionally enters people's respiratory tracts, leading to tuberculosis infection. The methods to stop spitting are: 1. Penalties: (A) The health administrative authorities should issue penalties prohibiting spitting everywhere. Anyone who violates the sanitary regulations and spits everywhere should be managed by well-trained sanitary police, with fines ranging from 30 cents to half a yuan as a warning. All fines should be allocated to tuberculosis prevention funds. (B) In schools and organizations, those who do not pay attention to hygiene, do not value themselves, and spit everywhere should be fined and ordered to examine their own sputum. They should also be ordered to write tuberculosis prevention slogans and draw tuberculosis prevention pictures. This can give offenders a deep impression of tuberculosis and provide materials for the public. Wouldn't this be a perfect strategy? 2. Rewards: Regardless of whether it is in schools, organizations, or institutions, those who carefully and honestly adhere to not spitting everywhere should be encouraged by the authorities with material rewards or certificates. Starting with elementary schools, developing good habits from childhood will have a greater effect.</p>
<p>(B) Expanding Tuberculosis Prevention Propaganda: 1. Film Propaganda: The development of film has become the cutting edge of modern business. The rapid progress of all industries relies on the power of film to promote, cultivate, and implement success. Tuberculosis prevention work can also use film to give our compatriots a proper understanding. 2. Written Propaganda: United tuberculosis prevention associations, national medical journals, and newspapers should publish tuberculosis prevention articles and illustrations to awaken people's attention. Tuberculosis prevention slogans should be posted in busy streets, public places, trains, trams, and buses. 3. Public Lectures: Invite medical experts to give lectures on tuberculosis issues, or go to organizations, schools, and factories to promote tuberculosis prevention, so that compatriots understand the fearfulness of tuberculosis and can prevent its invasion early. Or organize costumed drama troupes and propaganda teams for round-the-clock lecture teams to enhance propaganda strength. 4. Issue tuberculosis prevention calendars, so that compatriots can read tuberculosis prevention knowledge every day. 5. The government should designate a tuberculosis prevention year to conduct large-scale tuberculosis prevention campaigns, such as holding exhibitions, contacting various hospitals and health agencies, providing free physical examinations, and reducing the cost of X-rays to give compatriots the opportunity to examine themselves. 6. Organize a sputum prevention team, which goes to small vegetable markets and other places every morning to politely and gently tell the public the harm of spitting.</p>
<p>(C) Implementing Sanitary Education: 1. Compile sanitary teaching materials and tuberculosis prevention education materials. 2. The health administrative authorities should consult with the education authorities to add sanitary courses and tuberculosis prevention education in schools. 3. Schools should hold tuberculosis prevention debates or offer awards for essays to arouse students' attention to tuberculosis prevention. 4. Train public health personnel and pay attention to the implementation of tuberculosis prevention work.</p>
<p>(D) Sputum Disposal: 1. Spit sputum into a basin containing disinfectant solution, with a lid on the basin to prevent flies from perching on it and spreading tuberculosis. 2. Spit sputum into cloth or paper and burn it with fire. 3. Cover the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing to avoid spraying sputum on others. 4. For sputum scattered on the ground, the health administrative authorities and the tuberculosis prevention association should bring small signs to paste near the sputum, cover the sputum with lime, and mark it with eye-catching symbols to indicate danger. 5. Set up more sputum collection points in public places to facilitate sputum collection.</p>
<p>(E) Personal Hygiene: (1) Quit all bad habits that are harmful to the body to avoid reducing the body's resistance. 2. Pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, breathe fresh air outdoors, practice deep breathing, and get plenty of sunlight, because the sun is rich in ultraviolet light, which can enhance the body's resistance and has a bactericidal effect. 3. Consult a specialist doctor for early treatment of any diseases in the mouth or nose that may hinder breathing, because breathing through the mouth is harmful to lung health. 4. Eat more nutritious food, reduce worries, and avoid overwork. 5. Promote separate eating and implement sleeping alone. 6. Do not have contact with patients. If contact is unavoidable, wear a mask. Wash hands with hot water, soap, or disinfectant after contact. 7. Those who work with powder, dust, and dirt should wear a mask. It is best to wear a mask when traveling. 8. Prohibit kissing. 9. Join the tuberculosis prevention association and work together. 10. Ask a doctor to check your health once a year.</p>
<h3 id="e215">The Development of Pathology (Part 1) <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>—Medical Stories, No. 15—</p>
<p>On the wall of an Egyptian tomb, there are many figures painted. Among them is a young man with a leg that has become useless. Living in modern times, we can look at that picture and say: the young man in the book suffers from infantile paralysis. We know that a certain part of his spinal cord has been affected to a certain extent; we know this for sure, just as we know for sure that the bundle of wheat held by another person in the painting grew from wheat planted underground. But what did the ancient Egyptians think of that young man? Do you think they, like us, would think of the changes inside his body that were different from ordinary people? They would not think of it; even if they did, they would not be able to find out. Because the monks at that time did not allow researchers to dissect the body after death; all he could do was record the external changes of the body.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>For a long period of time, pathologists could only categorize various external changes they could observe on the body, and combine similar changes into groups. When they discovered a group of symptoms with no variation or slight succession, they gave it a name. In this way, based on the differences in the phenomena of rashes and accompanying symptoms, Sydenham defined the name "measles" to distinguish it from "scarlet fever." Aretaeus's explanation of diabetes—"the dissolution of flesh, discharged with urine"—also belongs to this method of pathological research. After classifying and naming various common diseases in this way, the causes and consequences of each group of symptoms—the frequency of death—were measured and recorded. When the disease progresses on the surface of the body or attached to the surface of the body—for example, injuries with splints, or dermal tumors, or tonsillitis—information about general tissue changes can be discovered. But what if the disease is hidden inside internal organs? Long after the Renaissance, the prohibition against dissecting the body clearly blocked any deeper examination of the tissues of the human body after death.</p>
<p>Naturally, this situation promoted the rise of personal theories about diseases and research methods. These theories and methods still have a certain desolate interest for us, because they are so similar to today's so-called "healing worship," such as: eclectic healing, massage, drug-free treatment, etc. The clever rules applied to all examples are the same. These methods all belong to deduction—starting with theory, then searching for facts to prove the theory. If they found facts that did not match the theory, they would treat the facts with arrogant contempt—as if the facts did not exist. This situation is not surprising, because pathologists at that time could not perform autopsy examinations, microscopes had not yet been invented, and they did not know bacteriology or physiological chemistry.</p>

<p>(76) Cholelithiasis (Continued)</p>
<p>Q: What symptoms occur after cholelithiasis develops?</p>
<p>A: When gallstones are present, there may be no symptoms clinically. However, when gallstones enlarge, a mass can be felt outside the abdominal wall. The most common symptom is biliary colic.</p>
<p>Q: What kind of pain is experienced during a biliary colic attack?</p>
<p>A: The onset of biliary colic is sudden: the pain is located in the liver area; it is a piercing or bursting pain. The patient suffers excruciating pain as a result. This is caused by the movement of gallstones within the bile duct stimulating the lining of the excretory duct. Therefore, the larger and sharper the gallstones, the more intense the pain.</p>
<p>Q: How do gallstones move?</p>
<p>A: The driving force behind the movement of gallstones includes contraction of bile duct muscles, bile stasis, abdominal wall tension, intestinal peristalsis, etc. In addition, strenuous physical activity, horse riding, car rides, dancing, overeating, pregnancy, menstruation, anger, and fright can also be triggering factors.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a specific time and location for the onset of biliary colic?</p>
<p>A: Biliary colic usually occurs in the evening or at night. Although the pain is usually in the liver area, it often radiates to the right shoulder, right arm, and right chest.</p>
<p>Q: What other systemic symptoms occur during a biliary colic attack?</p>
<p>A: The body often experiences chills and fever, nausea, vomiting, and cold sweats. The pulse is weak, and sometimes it can even lead to unconsciousness and convulsions.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any abnormalities in the patient's breathing and posture during a biliary colic attack?</p>
<p>A: Breathing is very shallow to avoid pressure on the liver area. The posture is mostly fetal position on the right side with knees bent.</p>
<p>Q: Can anything be detected externally in the area of the gallstones?</p>
<p>A: The gallbladder area is slightly raised and tender to pressure, indicating enlargement of the gallbladder and liver.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any abnormalities in the skin after a biliary colic attack?</p>
<p>A: Within one or two days, the entire skin and mucous membranes become jaundiced; the urine also turns yellowish-brown; the stool, however, becomes grayish-white due to lack of bile.</p>
<p>Q: Can the presence of gallstones be detected by X-rays?</p>
<p>A: Because the components of gallstones are radiopaque, they can be visualized by X-rays, which can also determine the location, size, and number of gallstones.</p>
<p>Q: How long does a biliary colic attack last?</p>
<p>A: From one or two hours to several days; there can be intermittent attacks.</p>
<p>Q: What are the reasons for the resolution of a biliary colic attack?</p>
<p>Q: The resolution of a biliary colic attack is due to the gallstone moving from the bile duct into the intestine, or back into the gallbladder, or settling in the bile duct while the mucous membrane and bile duct muscle contraction cease. It can also be caused by the gallstone falling into a wider bile duct, or the gallstone crumbling. These are all reasons for the resolution of biliary colic.</p>

<p>(74) Foreign Bodies in the Trachea and Bronchi</p>
<p>I have already discussed foreign bodies in the ear, nose, and throat separately. Now, the last type of foreign body I will discuss is foreign bodies in the trachea and bronchi, which is the most dangerous of the four types. They can be transformed from foreign bodies in the larynx (see previous issue). However, its biggest cause is really due to a sucking action. When children are playing, they often have objects in their mouths. If they suddenly cry, laugh, or get startled, the object in their mouth can be sucked into the trachea and bronchi along with the inhaled air. Thus, the formation of foreign bodies in the trachea and bronchi relies on a sucking action. This is a very clear fact. When adults have objects in their mouths, it is usually very small. So even if there is a sucking action, no harm will be caused. It is best for children not to have objects in their mouths, and they are more likely to cry and get startled, so objects in their mouths can be sucked into the trachea and bronchi at any time along with inhaled air, resulting in foreign bodies in the trachea and bronchi. Therefore, this disease, according to factual demonstration and clinical reports, occurs most often in children under the age of five.</p>
<p>The types of foreign bodies in the trachea and bronchi most commonly include small bamboo or white iron flutes (commonly known as "jiao jiao"), fruit pits, beans, rice grains, food scraps, chess pieces, and buttons. Metal pieces, bone fragments, and coins are less common.</p>
<p>The main symptoms of foreign bodies in the trachea and bronchi are frequent coughing, which is almost always present. And it often leads to breathing difficulties. If the foreign body is not removed immediately at this time, it can cause dangerous symptoms such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and suffocation. Many people have died as a result. Also worth noting is that after small foreign bodies enter the bronchi, coughing may temporarily stop. People often suspect that there is no foreign body present. But the result still causes symptoms such as bronchitis and pneumonia. In medicine, this type of foreign body is specifically called a chronic foreign body.</p>
<p>The most accurate diagnosis of this disease is to use X-rays for fluoroscopy and photography, or to perform a direct bronchoscopy. Its only treatment method is to first insert a bronchoscope after determining the location of the foreign body, and then use forceps to remove it. If breathing difficulties are obvious, then a tracheotomy should be performed first to save breathing, and then try to remove the foreign body.</p>
<p>Although this disease can be treated with first aid, it is still dangerous. Furthermore, families often do not want surgery, and inland hospitals may not have this special medical equipment. Therefore, the safest and simplest way is to pay attention to prevention. The most important preventative measures are four points:</p>
<p>Infants who have not yet developed teeth should not be given foods with pits or hard foods (especially when they are crying).</p>
<p>Parents should teach children not to put flutes, fruit pits, beans, chess pieces, buttons, metal pieces, and coins in their mouths when playing.</p>
<p>Small bamboo or white iron flutes (commonly known as "jiao jiao") rely entirely on the sucking action of the lips to make sound during play. Therefore, they are most easily sucked into the airway. I hope that parents will not buy them for their children.</p>
<p>Vendors selling this type of flute should be banned.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Common Knowledge Q&amp;A About Teeth (14) <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 81) What changes occur on the face when acute symptoms erupt?</p>
<p>(Answer) The side of the face near the affected tooth is generally swollen and raised.</p>
<p>(Question 82) How does an acute symptom resolve?</p>
<p>(Answer) Usually within a week, pus naturally penetrates the alveolar bone and breaks through the gum on the cheek or lip. After the pus is completely drained, all symptoms quickly disappear. Surgical incision or drilling to release the pus can alleviate the symptoms earlier. However, many patients believe that the disease is gone after the swelling and pain subside, and no longer seek medical treatment. As a result, the root cause is not removed, and pus remains dormant, developing into chronic periodontitis. Over the years, when the body is weak and resistance is low, it recurs as acute, cyclically harming health.</p>
<p>(Question 83) What dangers can occur during the acute eruption period?</p>
<p>(Answer) Three dangers can occur: If the disease spreads and pus unfortunately affects the jawbone, cellulitis will occur, which is not easy to treat. If pus accumulates for too long, its toxins are often absorbed by the blood, leading to increased systemic symptoms. If the pus itself enters the blood, it becomes sepsis, with increased fever, weak pulse, vomiting, and a condition similar to collapse, which is very dangerous. When the pus expands and seeks a way out, there is no fixed direction, but it will burst through the weakest point of resistance. Sometimes, it will penetrate the jawbone and break out on the outside of the cheek or chin, leaving permanent scars and ruining the appearance. Or it may spread into important cavities inside the head, such as the maxillary sinus, resulting in maxillary sinusitis, which is also very difficult to treat.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Hitler Insults Chinese People <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch on the 16th, German leader Hitler, in his book "Mein Kampf," has a chapter that discusses "Blacks and Chinese" together, which is quite insulting to the Chinese people. Our ambassador to Germany, Mr. Liu, has already held informal talks with the German government. Mr. Fink, the representative of German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, has agreed to revise or remove the chapter in the next edition of the book. Herr Hitler is today's European hero of the illusion of the "Third Reich." Elsewhere, some are "rising with the wind." Heroic fervor is currently permeating the world, and at their feet we catch a glimpse of countless hatreds and resentments. Italy's attack on Abyssinia is precisely to use the blood and flesh of blacks, whom Herr Hitler calls "inferior races," to congeal the throne of fascist heroes. According to Herr Hitler in his book "Mein Kampf," he divides the people of the world into two classes: one class is the so-called "inferior races," such as the Abyssinian blacks, who are currently being attacked by Italy, and the "Chinese," who are also being "befriended" and "assisted" by Japan, all belong to this class. These "inferior races" are naturally "destined for suffering" and should be arbitrarily invaded and slaughtered by the so-called "superior races" on the opposite side. Inferior races are destined to be the victims of those who call themselves superior races. The other class is those who Herr Hitler calls the "superior races." Within this class, there are also distinctions. All white people (except for the Soviet Union) are, although equally ordained superior races with the natural right to exploit inferior races bestowed by "God," there are "most superior races" among these many superior races. Where is this "most superior race" in the world? Hitler says proudly: It is Germany! Thus, Germany is naturally the country composed of the most superior race in the world, and it is divinely entitled to arbitrarily invade, slaughter, and exploit any other nation and country in the world. This is Herr Hitler, who claims to be the great hero of our time, and in his book "Mein Kampf" he has worked hard to express his most correct national view and world view.</p>
<p>Hitler's national view and world view are as described above. Naturally, under this "principle" of his, we, the "miserable" Chinese, are undoubtedly the "most inferior race" in the world today. It is a great honor that Herr Hitler is able to "raise his noble hand" and place us, the most unbearable inferior race in the world, together with the "black slaves" who have always been looked down upon by the "superior white people," which many Chinese people consider an insult. Our ambassador to Germany has made an informal protest to the German government. However, Abyssinia, a black race, is now unwilling to remain inferior and has raised the banner of anti-imperialist resistance, resolutely fighting against Italian airplanes and bombs. It now seeks to leap from the "most inferior race" and enter the ranks of the world's most superior races. The title of glorious "most superior race" must in fact be seized from the bloody struggle of the entire nation! Then the shameful title of "most inferior race" should also be washed away from the bloody struggle of the entire nation.</p>

<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>The little clock that I bought for one yuan has been my companion for more than a year, and now it has stopped ticking in the lonely room. But this time I forgot the suffering of not having a clock, because every time I wake up early in the morning, when I look at the painted wall of the south-facing morning window, I can clearly tell the time: when the sunlight shines on the pine forest in the painting, where the autumn wind seems to be rustling, it is usually half past six; if there is a bridge or water in the middle, it is already showing golden color, and the golden color also reflects the green leaves outside the window, it is more than seven o'clock, and when it slants further up, it is past eight o'clock.</p>
<p>Although seeing the shadow of the tree in the painting moving, I know that there is some cold wind blowing outside the window, but seeing the golden sunlight, it has the power to make me get up. Here, I also rediscovered the freshness of the morning, which is the most sobering time! After getting up, I first feel a burst of cold, and immediately look at the red glow faintly revealing through the gaps in the jungle, which cannot help but make people feel refreshed. Since I came to this island nation, I have become accustomed to getting up early. After washing my face with cold water, I silently nod to the red light flickering between the gaps in the jungle, and push open the glass door, stepping on the rustling gravel path, and walk along the fence and wooden house boards. The water in the small ditch flows slowly, wrapping the sweet and quiet morning air, red, yellow, half red and half yellow, green leaves, silently accompanying the calm and elegant walls and windows of each house, matching the vast blue clouds in the sky. At this time, I completely forget my frustration, my wandering in a foreign country, and my accumulated sadness. I just listen to the strange and interesting tone of my own wooden clogs stepping on the gravel road, and revel in this quiet place, like a beautiful countryside. Can a wanderer who has been rolling in the turbulent waves for a long time get this moment of rest? Sometimes when I realize myself, I pretend to wake up from a dream and ask myself in surprise!</p>
<p>After stepping on the gravel road, there is already the clanging sound of horses' hooves, this is the horse field, separated by a wide road, and on the other side is the mountain grassland of Takadanobaba. I glide across the blue sky again from the still not yet yellow green grass on the mountain, looking at the bright red sun, and my steps are lighter and faster. Climbing the mountain, I often fall down because the dew is still melting, and the ground is wet and slippery, but climbing high on the green grass on the mountain is too refreshing.</p>
<p>Autumn is waning, the weather is still very high and refreshing, and azure morning clouds float in the bright white morning sky. The wind blowing in my face is indeed cold, but I only feel that it makes my head light and refreshed, and I feel that my clothes are cumbersome. At this time, the cold wind becomes something worth thanking. The sunlight awakens the creatures on the ground. Standing on the flower plateau, overlooking the belt of trees beside the train tracks, birds fly up to meet the sun, and although the sound of crows is not wonderful, it always symbolizes an upward mood. Dogs emerge from the forest, followed by people showing their faces. There are also faint sounds of roosters crowing, and listening intently in the tranquility, there is another kind of artistic conception that is not found in the city.</p>
<p>Under the mountain, in front of the earthen cave, by the den with weeds as a door, the homeless wanderers sit quietly, exposing their lonely faces, basking in the sun. I carefully observe and realize that they have already burned a pile of fire in front of them with messy grass, and the ashes still have a slight smoke. At this time, people are turning on the fire basins, and the burrows of these homeless wanderers are even colder!</p>
<p>Looking over to the left, a few low, dilapidated wooden houses appear desolate. A little girl is standing at the door of one of the houses, stretching out a pair of red, frozen, shivering little hands, probably also looking at the sun! It is a pity that the sun is difficult to shine under the mountain, which is blocked by the mountain.</p>
<p>I often revel in this beautiful, calm, fresh, pure morning air, silently watching the whole of Tokyo shrouded in stillness, and forgetting my sadness. However, in quiet times, it is precisely when I am deeply immersed in contemplation, facing the desolate little girl in front of the dilapidated house under the mountain, the homeless wanderer beside the grass burrow, and my own frustrated and haggard shadow, shaking again. This beautiful and clear morning in a foreign country - although it can make me temporarily forget this infinite sadness, it cannot bury it!</p>

<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>That was two years ago. I had just left school not long ago, and I was quietly stranded in Taicheng, not far from my home. At that time, the wind sweeping in from the suburbs and the river was so cold as it blew along the clean and tidy streets. Like many other unemployed young people who had just run out of school, I wore a look of melancholy and anxiety, running around in groups of intellectuals. As usual, the Zuoxin Printing Company became a place where many strangers gathered.</p>
<p>Boss Yu was an optimist. He always bit on his pipe and slowly puffed out gray-white smoke rings, glaring at the students who came in to buy stationery and the women who came out of the countryside. However, he was able to handle the bill collectors and the affairs of the store on the one hand, while very deftly greeting the many young people who had been or had not been teachers, who came and went. His appearance made me feel that he was extremely busy, but in fact, he was very leisurely. Every day, he would always take these guests to the teahouse four or five times to pass the time. This was of course due to his generosity. In fact, in the entire county and township, or rather in the entire county seat, all the school supplies and printed matter were concentrated in his company, and these many young and middle-aged people were his customers.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I had only just met him then, because I often went to his store to sleep with some friends who were looking for jobs, such as those who hoped to become principals. In this way, I was "treated" by Boss Yu several times. Moreover, I went to his place every day. Besides talking to the boss, I could very clearly see the anxious faces of many people who were much more at a loss than I was. One day, I ran into the Zuoxin Printing Company from the office of a financier who was also a county councilor, carrying a sense of depression and disappointment. Boss Yu smiled and said to me:</p>
<p>"Brother Feng, do you know? Pingzhou has a good chance of becoming the principal of Risheng Elementary School. He's like a brother to you, so you can definitely get a job safely. I congratulate you!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, his drunk-looking red face smiled excitedly, twitching non-stop.</p>
<p>When he said this to me, I immediately picked up the telephone and called Pingzhou:</p>
<p>"What? Remember, you and I have suffered the same hardships!"</p>
<p>However, the words that came from the telephone dealt me a serious blow:</p>
<p>"This is really not easy. You know, even if I become the principal, I don't have the right to hire teachers. Now, the school board appoints them based on the seniority of the family in the genealogy. Each family occupies several teacher positions. In fact, there are currently more than one hundred intellectuals at home who are unemployed, who have returned from Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou, and at the same time, there are a large number of graduates from the county high school and normal school. How can these dozen or so teaching positions be properly distributed? Brother Feng, you have ambition, why would you run back to do this unpromising little teacher! You must work hard, you can have a better future!"</p>
<p>I was stunned. I sighed and hung up the phone. All that was swirling in my head were sad shadows... Where can I go? How can I live without a job? Rural education has rolled into such a dangerous circle.</p>
<p>"It's no wonder," Boss Yu puffed out a puff of smoke, and chuckled lightly. He looked at me and said, "Our clan is the same. They fought for the principal and teacher positions, and everyone became enemies. There are fewer students, but there are too many people who want to be teachers. This world is as difficult to do business in as it is to do business. Our business seems to be pretty good on the surface, but the debts that are owed cannot be collected. For example, if the school has a disturbance and a new principal is replaced, the new principal will not manage it and will not be responsible for the printing fees owed by the old principal. Really..."</p>
<p>The boss sighed and looked at the people sitting there, whom I did not know, and said:</p>
<p>"How is it on your side, Mr. Li? Has the fighting stopped?"</p>
<p>A tall man in a suit sitting opposite me smiled bitterly and said:</p>
<p>"This is the wonder of the world. The teachers who have already started teaching have been expelled for no reason, and they have even fought. In fact, this is a trick for the powerful people in the village to fight each other!"</p>
<p>"Trick!" Boss Yu smiled and looked at me and said, "Brother Feng! Did you hear that? The principal of the county normal school was appointed by order of Commander-in-Chief ××! It's amazing. There are also ten people competing for the principal of the county's third elementary school, including university students, political science students, high school students, and normal school students, but the introducers are all playing tricks. In the end, the one introduced by Commissioner ×× succeeded, but what about the teachers? The principal has almost no power."</p>
<p>My head was dizzy and my hope of finding a job had disappeared without a trace. After wandering in a group of anxious people for a long time, I left Taicheng, left Boss Yu, and set off on my new journey.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Clearing Barren Hills <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— From Long</p>
<p>The group of people living in the small place called Yu Le Ba specialize in clearing barren hills for others. Aside from bravely using their ox-like brute strength to clear barren hills overgrown with brambles, they seem to have no other life skills or abilities.</p>
<p>These people's homes seem to be unfixed. Sometimes, people hire them to clear land, and then their extremely simple homes move along with them; for every few miles cleared, the home moves forward once, like the nomadic life of ancient times, living by water and grass. Naturally, the children in the family, and some livestock like chickens and dogs, also move forward with them. The older children go with their fathers or brothers to the front as soon as it dawns, carrying tree trunks and dry branches back home to use as firewood for cooking and building houses.</p>
<p>From afar, one sees a hazy, thick black smoke, and tongue-like crimson flames, rising in clusters, soaring straight into the clouds. The raging flames burn and spread among the tangled jungles, making crackling sounds, mixed with the clear, crisp sound of axes and adzes cutting wood. When women and children see this black smoke and hear this sound, they know that their husbands, fathers, or brothers are earning their food and clothing, using their brute strength and resolute courage to clear barren hills for others.</p>
<p>Clearing barren hills is originally an extremely difficult and dangerous thing. Needless to say, the land cleared is remote and barren. Therefore, their daily necessities and food have to be transported from outside in advance. In the barren hills, they often suffer from bloating due to unclean drinking water, unable to get up and work again, quietly ceasing to breathe.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are two things that make people feel even more afraid. One is called miasma, and the other is poisonous snakes. When land clearers encounter these two things, it's as terrifying as encountering a ghost in the pitch-black night, feeling that their life is not far from heaven! However, miasma is not encountered in every barren hill. As for poisonous snakes, there is always the danger of them visiting bare legs. Lai Tou Xiao Er's grandfather and father all died in the mouths of poisonous snakes. Everyone in Yu Le Ba knows this, and clearly understands that clearing barren hills is an extremely dangerous job. However, what other life skills do these people have besides using brute strength and life to earn a living!</p>
<p>One afternoon, the women and children were strolling in front of the simple attap houses, watching clusters of black smoke and crimson flames rising from the forest in front, floating slowly into the sky, turning half of the sky red. Suddenly, a burst of gongs and drums beat urgently, mixed with a clamorous human voice. The sound slipped into their ears, and their hearts couldn't help but pound. They knew in their hearts that they had encountered a dangerous thing again. (This is a habit of the barren hill clearers. When they encounter poisonous snakes in the barren hills, they beat cloth drums and copper gongs urgently, as if beating gongs and drums can resist the attack of poisonous snakes)?</p>
<p>The women in the back, with pounding hearts, ran to the desolate barren forest, squeezed into the crowd, and asked, "Who is it, who has been bitten by a poisonous snake"? Staring with bulging eyes, short disheveled hair fluttering in front of her forehead.</p>
<p>"Lai Tou Xiao Er, and… a total of three people." The voice coming from the crowd was low and sad.</p>
<p>"How is it, is it serious"? Someone asked with great concern.</p>
<p>"Alas, it's so pitiful, three generations all died in the mouths of poisonous snakes!" The women around shook their heads and sighed, watching Lai Tou Xiao Er's mother, like a madwoman, with disheveled hair and tears all over her face, holding Lai Tou Xiao Er's body and crying and shouting!</p>
<p>After the corpse was carried out of the barren hill, this tragedy seemed to dissipate like smoke. The barren hill clearers continued to do their unfinished work. Clusters of thick black smoke and crimson blood flames still rose between the trees, and everywhere there were the sounds of wood burning, and the sound of axes and adzes.</p>

<p>Topic: "Random Notes from Chun Zai Tang"</p>
<p>The poetry topic was "Smoky Vegetables, Falling Flowers Large." My opening line was, "Flowers fall, but spring remains." Xiangxiang deeply appreciated it, saying, "This is similar to 'A general will fly, but also performs a returning wind dance. Fallen, yet still make up half a face.' His future achievements are immeasurable." However, I ended up being abandoned for life, failing my teacher's expectations. How shameful! Xiangxiang entered and exited the positions of general and minister, personally stabilized the southeast. His achievements were unparalleled at the time. He was especially good at physiognomy. Those he recognized and promoted are countless famous ministers and generals. Only I am worthless. My teacher's ability to judge people is clear. In the fourth year of Tongzhi, I was in Nanjing, staying with Mr. Yu. He mentioned the previous line and said, "Thinking about it now, arriving at Pengshan for the first time, the wind leads back to the country. It truly fits the falling flower. However, I have been living in seclusion, writing about my life, already reaching eighty volumes. Although I dare not hope for a famous mountain altar, if a single word of my poor and sorrowful writing is passed down, perhaps one can also say that spring remains." This is meaningless talk, just to make light of it. What is meant is, "Chun Zai Tang." When I see my teacher in the future, I should ask him to write these three words.</p>

The seasonal salary is fifty gold. Living, and doing the monkey king. In the daytime, I sit quietly by the west window to teach. In the evening, I trim the candles and correct the papers, my mind is distraught. Sometimes, the wind and rain are so wet. I, burn wine to dispel sorrow, but my sorrow is full. Sometimes, the moon is bright and the stars are sparse and clean. I, burn incense and tell heaven. I am afraid that my parents are sick and I cannot serve them. I cannot bring them medicine in front of the window. Parents miss their son, their liver and intestines are broken. The son misses his parents, tears are flowing.

The sun shines on the bamboo pole, shining on the gauze hall.</p>

<p>"Aftermath of the Robbery, Peach Blossoms" written by Hong Shen, directed by Zhang Shichuan, and starring Hu Die, has been filming for four months. During which, filming was temporarily stopped due to Hu Die's honeymoon. Now Ms. Hu has returned to the studio and is working again. The set is a purely oriental-style mansion garden, which is very sophisticated. The walls and pillars are carved with dragons and phoenixes, which took four weeks and cost more than a thousand yuan to complete. Filming started the other day. In addition to Hu Die, the actors include Sun Min, Xu Xinyuan, etc. The first shot was Sun Min moving into Hu Die's new apartment. There are as many as fourteen large and small suitcases. It is expected that all the scenes on the set will take two weeks to film, and work is continuing day and night.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Shen Xiling is about to leave, and friends held a farewell dinner at Zheng Yingshi's house in Renhe Lane last night.</p>
<p>The end of the year is approaching, I wonder how many companies will issue a month's worth of back wages? If back wages cannot be issued by the end of the year, then most employees will live in the "company".</p>
<p>(Currently, most employees still live outside. If there is no money at the end of the year, they will be evicted and have to live in the "company".)</p>
<p>"Imperial Envoy" has been restaged in the Central Theater, and Miss Lan Ping, the "Carpenter's Wife", has suddenly recovered from her illness before the public performance, as per "customary practice". If you encounter Tang Na, please take the trouble to inquire.</p>
<p>Prediction: This Christmas, the volcano will be very crowded with people in the circle. (The reason is self-evident) Whether the New Year will be the same as Christmas depends on whether the back wages are paid.</p>
<p>According to "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside", the Wan brothers' mosquito advertisement is attached to the film, but this is not a good business.</p>
<p>Some people saw Xue Menglang wearing a bra and briefs while swimming in "Peach Blossom Dream" and thought it was Yang Xiaojun.</p>
<p>It is said that Li Pingqian's "Love Letter" has been renamed "Peach and Plum are Abundant".</p>
