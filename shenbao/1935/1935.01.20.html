<h3 id="c22">民食問題中之洋米問題　柳 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>我國之食糧問題。至今猶爲一啞謎。爲盈爲絀。爲勉可自給。無有能確切言之者。照歷年進口糧食論。固無人不知其爲不足。然如二十二年秋收之後。二十三年旱災未發生以前之各産米省分。焦思苦慮於穀賤傷農之爲患。迨乎旱災逐漸進行。禁止米糧輸出。於是皇皇然又以不足爲慮。誠所謂曾幾何時。而前後矛盾若是。是眞不可索解者矣。</p>
<p>自災象成後。在上海方面。米價日貴。此日貴之原因。多半尙爲人心恐慌作用。因慮食糧不足。乃紛紛訂購洋米。以補不足。最近聞登記之洋米。已達四百六十萬包。有以爲今年缺米最甚者爲浙。約少一千萬包。江南約少二百萬包。江西約少一百萬包。合共一千三百萬包。出産方面。江北約有二百萬包。安徽約有二百萬包。湖南一百五十萬包。湖北宜沙一帶有五十萬包。福建泉漳等地。亦有五十萬包。浙温屬約五十萬包。共計七百萬包。供求相較。不足六百萬包。除已登記之四百六十萬包。則不足之數。僅爲百餘萬包。况尙有未登記之洋米。併合計算。所缺無幾。靑黃不接時期。糧食似可無問題。此一派樂觀論調。與不久以前恐將不得食及慮價昂之狀態。又截然不同。以此相推。更安知不數月後。不又將以糧食不敷。春熟不登。蟲害復作。稻作不利之種種藉口。而糧價大漲特漲乎。</p>
<p>近來米價。曾有一度小挫。其原因不外（一）洋米定貨之到期者。陸續將於舊歷年内趕到。（二）河下到米甚旺。因内地銀根緊急。咸思出售米穀。備總結賬期結束之用。</p>
<p>（三）滬上銀根明鬆暗緊。一方急於出糶。一方無意多存。米價遂呈疲茶之狀。然此尙爲一時現象。紅盤開出後米價如何。又非預先所能測度耳。吾人以爲目前所應考慮者。有左列各點。</p>
<p>（一）上海之米。除自用外分運南北各埠。而浙西居多數。浙西本缺米。大旱之後。所缺更巨。查民國十八年蘇浙一帶。蟲害爲災。十九年上海洋米進口。有七百十三萬八千四百零六担。本年如以四百六十萬包計算。（每包作二百磅折算）折合爲六百九十萬担。與十九年全年進口之數。相差無多。如再繼續訂購。勢必超過十九年之最高額。然一觀浙西農民經濟。更不如十九年矣。自絲繭失敗。農産低賤。更繼之以稀有之旱災。室如懸磬。面有菜色。不啻爲今日之浙西農民寫照。故浙西固缺食。固需米。然實無購買力。滬上雖多米。浙西恐仍多餓莩。卽此四百六十萬包洋米。能否如十九年順利出售。尙有考慮之餘地也。如洋米陷於過剩。其必然之現象。一爲米價下跌。連帶牽動本米之行市。二則民國二十一年米商所受定米之損害。元氣未復。斷難再度虧損。設以此波及金埠之商業。担保之金融業。則其所關。非僅米業之本身而已。故於未來洋米之訂購。宜應加以相當節制者也。</p>
<p>（二）余嘗謂貿易問題無辦法。白銀問題亦無辦法。耿愛德氏曾謂解决貿易入超問題。祇要糧食不進口。足可抵銷。（原文見經濟專刋第九五期）去年以來。白銀輸出甚鉅。固有一部分爲販運牟利者。然大宗爲應付之貨欵也。現在已非節用洋貨，提倡土貨，無以解目前困厄之時。若仍有大宗糧食付欵支出。不更增加白銀流出之速率乎。卽以訂存之洋米論。貨價（稅除外）每包估十元。已有四千六百萬元。訂額再增。則付出之欵亦增。故從貿易着想。對於續訂洋米。自有審愼顧慮之必要。然此非爲已訂有洋米者圖利益也。以今冬之奇暖。菜豆著華。麥苗雄長。近三日來天氣寒冷冰結。早發育之豆麥。不禁寒威之摧殘。勢必凍死。春熟失望。災民將又受打擊。設想及此。則未來之民食問題。誠爲莫大之急務。應由中央於國計民生雙方兼籌之下。確立方針。早作準備。洋米之應否續訂。亦不難隨以解决。若欲以地方之力。處置不准登記之洋米。勢必多所糾葛。不觀夫越南商約之遲遲未成。非即爲洋米徵稅之一點乎。吾人誠宜以萬分鄭重之態度。以考慮此一問題矣。</p>

<p>小恊商集團團結益固</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　薩爾問題解决之後、各方面所發生之希望、於昨日各國代表在國聯會行政院會議交換竟見時、胥已自由發揮、在此多種私人談話中、德國回返日内瓦之問題、亦曾爲各國代表所提及、此外法國所剏議之東歐互助公約計劃、又復成爲一時討論之中心、法國外交部長賴伐爾昨晚曾與蘇俄及巴爾幹恊商各國代表、作長時間之商討、巴爾幹恊商各國政府對於此一問題、原已表不贊同意見、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙某軍事機關報對於法外長賴伐爾及波外長貝克在日内瓦之談話、表示樂觀之意見、謂兩國外長之談話已能泯除兩國之異見、雖兩外長談話之實際結果、僅能增進法國對於波蘭原則上之諒解、但在波蘭視之、其政策已佔勝利矣、兩人之談話與羅馬恊定及東歐羅迦諾公約有關、質言之、解决東歐問題之政治基礎、必須顧全波蘭之利益、波蘭外長旣已一再鄭重申明此意、故此點必須列入東歐問題之任何討論也、苟能達此、則波蘭對於各種恊定或抱積極態度云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>華沙半官性之波蘭日報、今日以顯著地位登載日内瓦電訊、謂自消息靈通方面得悉、日内瓦之談判並未提及東歐公約問題、並標其題曰、「東歐公約之僵局」、電文雖甚含糊、但華沙方面政界則認此爲賴伐爾與貝克談話之結果、若然則法報日内瓦電訊所稱波蘭與法外長賴伐爾談判後、仍未改變其拒絶加入東歐羅迦諾公約態度之說、似已證實矣、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　據每日電聞所載、法外長賴伐爾與小恊約各國·巴爾幹各國·及蘇俄代表等討論後、羅馬恊定中關於多瑙河流域之不干涉公約問題、已發現許多難題、法外長所接洽之各國、暫時尙未就範、蓋三小恊約國之外長業已發一議定書、規定小恊約國或巴爾幹各國、非俟賴伐爾能於德國或波蘭拒絶簽訂東歐公約時與蘇俄訂立合作條約、將不參加多瑙河公約、小恊約及巴爾幹各國且保留權力、自議如何參加多瑙河公約之手續、並聞李維諾夫亦抱同樣態度、各國均須賴伐爾偕佛蘭亭總理至倫敦前、予以堅决之保證、此事可證蘇俄小恊約及巴爾幹各國間之團結、故賴伐爾須於日内决定態度也云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>— 笠萊</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們不是都想成就你們的欲望，或想在將來做個大人物嗎？我可以斷定地說一句「欲望是成功之母」，只要你們有毅力，具有大無畏的精神去幹，早晚能成就的。假如你們不信的話，我可以舉一個榜樣給你們聽：</p>
<p>從前麥丹的國王因失敗後躱在一所破舊的茅屋内，這時候他很懊悔，於是他復仇的心以此漸漸地消滅了。後來他忽在一根橫豎的棟樑上看見有一隻蜘蛛在做網，它吐了六次的絲終於失敗，可是它毫不悔心，依舊努力地向着它選中的地方吐絲，到第七次它成功了，這一種舉動，具有毅力的舉動，感動了國王，這時候國王振起了精神，召集了百名勇士去抵抗敵國，果然不上幾天，就將喪失的國土給他收復了。</p>
<p>小朋友呀，「人皆可以爲堯舜」，你們不要輕視自已，你們是將來的偉人呀，假如你們具有百折不撓的毅力的話。前進吧！你們的祖國在向你們求救呀！</p>
<h3 id="c268">牛頓的童年 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 希旦</p>
<p>英國的大科學家—牛頓先生，他幼小的時候體質很弱；他的母親，費盡了心力去撫養他。惟恐他不能自立。却想不到他後來竟發揮他的天才，造成大業，永遠受人家的稱讚和崇拜。</p>
<p>牛頓在十二歲的時候，在一個公立學校肄業；但是，不肯用功，而成績也不好。後來，因爲同學欺侮他，他覺得非常痛苦，纔立志發憤去求學。</p>
<p>他對於一切學問，都想應用到實際上去，刀·鋸·斧·鎚·這些東西，是他常常使用的器具，而且手法練得非常精熟，他年紀雖小，却常常想拿自已的技能來試騐試騐。</p>
<p>在他村落附近的一條路上，有人建設了一架風車，他仔細的去偵察，把那工程的佈置，機器的構造，都完全參透了，不多幾時，他就照樣造起一架風車，建在他的屋頂上，一息不停的在那裏旋轉。他這風車的内部各機關，簡單和原物没有絲毫差異。</p>
<p>小朋友，我們要知道他後來能做出驚人的事業，不完全是倚賴天才，還是因爲他能够立志呀！</p>
<p>（註一）偵察，就是觀察而加以思考的意思。</p>
<h3 id="c269">不怕冷 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>小英雄，肯吃苦，也肯不避艱難的努力。不過這種魄力，也須日積月累的修養。驕養慣的公子哥兒，脆弱的身體，怎會有這般的毅力呢！</p>
<p>過這寒天，不怕寒冷，人人知道，也人人會說，可是實行的能有幾人呢？我瞧見租界上異國的小英雄，在寒風雪陣中，披着短大衣，露着膝蓋，提着書包，跳跳蹤蹤的上學去了。返觀我們的小英雄呢，父母溺愛一些的，早已呌他們在屋子裏烤火，不讓他們上學去了。平常的孩子，也穿得像駱駝一般的臃腫，没精打彩地拖曳着笨重的脚步。</p>
<p>英國的海軍偉人納爾遜，是歷史上有名的人物。他在小時，因爲風雪載道，怕冷不去。他的爸爸說道：「去不去任你，不過畏首畏尾，不是大丈夫應有的態度」。他聽了這話，立刻拖了哥哥，一同到學校裏去。</p>
<p>小朋友們，在這寒天，不怕冷，也和納爾遜一樣。那末將來的成就，也未必不及納爾遜咧！</p>
<h3 id="c270">敏兒的寒假消寒法 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 菱湖昭</p>
<p>光陰過得很快。一霎時又是放寒假了。許多小朋友們都挾着書包回家。那眞是好像一羣脫籠的小鳥一般，活潑潑地跳躍着。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們，你們在這長長的假期内，你們所讀過的書，或許因爲没有先生的督促而忘記的。就是你們的爹媽也以爲假期而放任你們了。那你們便很危險了，我想信你們再進學校考試時，一定不及格，不能升班，這是多麽可怕可恥呵！</p>
<p>那末，我們一味用功嗎？那也不對的。讓我把敏兒的寒假消寒法介紹給你們吧！</p>
<p>（一）七點鐘起身，寫大小楷二張，到門外作呼吸運動。</p>
<p>（二）九點鐘做做算術，畫圖畫，和弟弟踢鍵子。</p>
<p>（三）午後一個鐘點内同哥哥按按風琴，唱唱歌曲。</p>
<p>（四）午後二點鐘讀國語，寫生字，和背書。</p>
<p>（五）四點鐘時到同學處玩玩。（或呌哥哥領我出去遊公園。）</p>
<p>（六）晚飯後，請爹爹講故事，或和弟猜謎子，最後寫日記睡覺了。</p>
<p>小朋友，你們也可自已定一張表來實行的。</p>

<h3 id="c274">動物怎樣過冬天？ <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>天冷了，什麽蟲兒，鳥兒都不大看見了，它們到那裏去了？小朋友們，你們想到過麽？</p>
<p>動物像人一樣，也是怕冷的，它們也有過冬的方法。你們看第一圖，螳螂雖然死了，但是它在秋天，已經産卵在樹枝上面，卵的外面有一層膠質包着，呌做蛸螵，裏面的許多卵子，經過冬天不死，到了次年夏天，小螳螂又生出來了。再看第二圖，一到冬天，螞蟻（蜜蜂也是如此）不再出來了，躱在窠裏過冬。因爲它們平時積蓄了許多糧食，在冬天也不會餓死了。再看第三圖，蛙，蛇，龜之類是睡在泥土裏過冬的，這呌做冬眠，他們在這時候，一點也不吃東西，可是不會餓死，因爲它們身體裏藏好了許多補養的東西，慢慢地在那裏消化的緣故。再看第四圖，鳥和獸一到了冬天，增加它們的羽毛，它們的身體就不覺得冷了。我們人到了冬天要多穿衣服，原來鳥獸自已會加添衣服的啊，再看第五圖，水中的魚蝦大都躱到冰下的泥裏，不再游到水面上來，和冰上的冷空氣接觸了。再看第六圖，燕子預先知道冬天要來，早於秋天飛到温暖的南方過冬了，同時，雁却由北方飛到我們這個地方來，因爲北方比我們這裏冷得多呢。</p>

<h3 id="c275">下雨前的預兆 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>小朋友！你到學校去的時候，忽然在途中下雨了，落得頭淋水滴，好似一隻落蕩鷄，你想：這是多麽没趣呢？本來我們要看天氣晴不晴，祇要看氣壓表好了，但我們是否個個有一個呢？我想：不見得罷！諸位小朋友！對於老天下雨前的現象，的確是値得我們討論一下的。然而我們未看下文以前，在下雨前的天氣，我甚麽變化，有何與晴天不同而特殊的地方，這種啓示，就叫預兆。</p>
<p>一·燕雀高飛，是晴天的預兆，反之則爲下雨。</p>
<p>二·遠山看得近，則爲下雨。</p>
<p>三·遠處鐘聲聽得明，則爲下雨。</p>
<p>四·煤烟不能上昇，則爲下雨。</p>
<p>五·東虹日頭，西虹則爲雨。</p>
<p>六·東方日出，天色帶紫則雨。</p>
<p>七·蛤螟叫，下雨不久便開始。</p>
<p>八·螞蟻歸穴，是爲久雨的預兆。</p>
<p>九·稻菓着露，就是晴天，反則下雨。</p>
<p>十·地上潮濕，出汗珠，就要下雨。</p>
<p>十一·汽笛從遠處鳴叫，聽得明亮，則爲下雨。</p>
<p>十二·月有　則爲下雨的預兆。</p>
<h3 id="c276">鉛筆的研究 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 苦</p>
<p>我我們現在用來寫字的鉛筆，有許多人没有詳細的研究過，都以爲它是用鉛來製造的，這是大錯而特錯了。其實鉛筆是用石墨來製造的。</p>
<p>石墨是從鑛裏採出來的，所以是一種鑛物，質地黑而輕鬆。</p>
<p>鉛筆的材料是石墨，泥土，柏木，橡皮四種，它的製法：是把石墨和泥土混合成漿，放到水壓機上。機上有模，模上有許多洞，洞的圓徑，和所要的鉛筆心的粗細相同。石墨和泥土的漿，就從這模壓過去，於是就成爲一條一條的鉛筆心，把它截斷，拿到火爐邊去烘乾，就可以使用了。</p>
<p>至於鉛筆心的軟硬，並不是石墨自已，是泥土成分多少的緣故。此外保護鉛筆心的木，必須木質柔軟，不易彎曲，才可合用。</p>
<p>小朋友，你們不要看輕了這一支小小的鉛筆，是不値研究的。其實在這宇宙間的一事一物，都有研究的價値。</p>
<h3 id="c277">電燈泡變爲金魚缸 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 道生</p>
<p>金魚缸可以利用壞了的電燈泡製造，方法很簡單：最先將燈泡上的黑質硬物用尖鐵器去掉。這部工作並不困難，黑質硬物去掉以後，可以看到一層玻璃連着燈泡内的玻璃小棒用，尖釘小心將那層玻璃打破，玻璃小棒即可取出，燈泡内便没有東西而且同外界相通了，水加到裏面以後、便可以養小金魚</p>
<p>燈泡頭上原有兩個小釘，平常用以安置在燈頭上的，現在可以很容易的取去，所遺下的兩個小洞，可以穿上一根細繩子，以便將這自製的小魚缸吊起來。</p>

<p>— 文譽揚</p>
<p>馬類</p>
<p>（一）角馬　産在菲洲，是脊椎動物反芻偶蹄類，它的鬃毛尾巴都很像馬。所不同的，它却長着角，從前有人說馬出角希奇的，現在我們可以知道馬中也有角馬。小朋友覺得奇怪嗎？</p>
<p>（二）河馬　也是馬的一種，但不反芻，它的身體有一丈多長，眼睛和耳朶很小，嘴很闊，腿很短，每條腿上有四隻爪，有蹼連在爪上。它的性情喜歡住在水裏，並且能游泳，白天睡覺，晚上出來尋東西吃。</p>
<p>（三）駱馬　産在南美洲，是反芻動物偶蹄類，有人說它是美洲的駱駝，身體和驢差不多大小，能載運東西經過險要的山嶺。</p>
<p>（四）斑馬　産在南菲洲是脊椎動物奇蹄類，它的身體有六七尺長，四條腿很細，全身銀白色，身上一道一道的黑條紋，視覺，嗅覺，聽覺，都很靈敏，跑得很快，不容易捉到它們。它們的樣子又像驢，所以又呌斑驢。小朋友在電影上可曾看見過没有？</p>
<h3 id="c279">水手辛白德傳（三） <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 心青</p>
<p>我正在講述我的故事，船中有幾個人走上來了。他們一見我，就知道我是辛白德，曾有好多時和他們同在一船的；所以我也不用更費許多時光，向船主證明我不是騙子了。末後他便說道：「該感頌上帝，你正平安着。這裏是你的貨物；你取去由你如何擺佈好了。」</p>
<p>那些包子因又歸到我的手中，我便深深地感謝此人。</p>
<p>我對他說：「請取我一部分的貨物去，作爲禮物；因爲你是個公正的人！」但他却對我說並没想到這樣的事。</p>
<p>於是我把貨物中最好的東西贈與梅勒奇王，因爲他如此的厚待我。那時他聽了我這幸運的事，也很快樂。</p>
<p>不上幾時，我便搭着那載我貨包來的船出發，仍回到我的故鄉。</p>
<p>我家裏的人都樂於見我，因爲我出去了多時，他們都以爲我已死了。我造了一所華屋，買了奴隸和田地，因爲我已决意在巴克達度我的餘年了。</p>
<p>辛白德的第二次航行</p>
<p>不久我就想改變我的生活狀况了。我志願再做一次賣買，於是買了貨物運到海上，以備下一次的旅行。我們經行各地，我的貨物賣得很好。</p>
<p>一天我們來到一個島上，長滿着各種果樹的，我們上岸去，但是在我們走到的所在，却不見此地有人畜的踪跡。</p>
<p>我離開了我的朋友們，在一條溪旁坐下，把我所帶來的食物飽餐了一頓。按着便躺了下來，一會兒已沉沉入睡了。</p>

<h3 id="c322">華羅深女士講中國婦女問題 <a href="#c322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— 謝靑</p>
<p>據本月十三日「時事新報」所載北平各界婦女聯合會最近請到一位前北平市公務局長華南圭夫人講演，聽說她是法國籍，擅長文學，曾有聯華所採用之電影劇本「戀愛與犧牲」以及「文星」等名著云。</p>
<p>講題是「中國婦女問題」，照她想中國婦女有三個成問題的地方：（一）中國婦女不注重衛生，（二）有不良的嗜好，不歡喜讀書看報。</p>
<p>這就呌做問題！</p>
<p>這的確也是問題，不過大抵不是我們中國大多數的婦女問题吧？這只是中國的貴婦人，太太的問题罷了。她們吃得好，穿得好，不用勞作，不學會點不良的嗜好如打麻將，吸鴉片烟，喝酒……等，你却呌她們怎樣過活？吸鴉片喝酒自然是不大合衛生，但讀書看報對於她們又有何用？—也許會看看報的，不過看的大概是什麽跑狗賽馬的盛會，什麽香豔肉感的電影廣告，與中國社會或中國的婦女解放無關的。</p>
<p>問題是這樣的爲華羅深女士所認識，那問題的解决自然是高明得有限了，據說「作出一種類似郵票的小票子，貼在信封上，寄到各處，呌人見到，就知道有所警惕……」</p>
<p>這就是解决婦女問題的方案！如果這麽一來，眞能「警惕」了那些堕落的婦女羣，而有所覺悟，那也眞是省力得很；不過，我想，問題還得延長下去的，卽使她們想改變了這種生活吧，但往後又呌她們怎麽去過日子呢！—歷史命定她們，她們是上流女人，不需勞作的。</p>
<p>中國的婦女問題，决不是呌一位「擅長文學」的女人，來在這般浮面的現象上所能够捉摸到的。婦女問題，原來只是整個的社會問題的一環，要追問牠發生的根源，是必需追究到形成婦女問題的社會制度的。</p>
<p>中國婦女的悲慘情况，想來或者不是一個公務局長的夫人的眼睛所能見到的。差不多不用誰個去「警惕」她，生活的越歷就會指示給她們：她們覺得苦痛，覺得難受！</p>
<p>的確，中國大多數的婦女是不衛生的：她們的生活條件不容許她們「衛生」一點兒，中國的女士，在未到發育完滿以前，早就要開始每日十多小時的勞働；中國的女工在懷孕的時期，廠主不容許她們告假去休養，中國的失業的女人，從鄉村拐賣來的女子，她們被迫充當爲娼妓之類，因而爲適應上等人的需要，習慣了一些不良的嗜好……凡這些，是她們願意的嗎？是她們本身的罪惡嗎？</p>
<p>中國的大多數的婦女，她們在「女子無才便是德」的封建意識的教育原則上長成，或者資本主義的商業式的學校拒絶了她們，使她們大多數都是文盲，對她們談什麽讀書看報，不顯然是捨本逐末嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c323">衡陽的知識婦女羣 <a href="#c323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>衡陽是湖南湘水之濱的一個縣城，在文化</p>
<p>上，並不是十分落後的地方，反之，牠以緊扼着湘水上游各城市的交通總匯，顯得非常動躍，僅次子省會的長沙；人民富有野蠻的氣質，時常因細故毆鬥而流血。——這樣環境之下成長着的婦女，在學校裏，因自身利益常常發生驅逐飯桶教員的鬥爭；在社會上，也鳳毛麟角的有爲革命而犧牲的。但這些，現在似乎都成爲過去的陳迹，和當時爭取縣議會女議席的民權運動，一樣寂寞的消沉了。知識婦女變得更庸俗，更腐化，—革命婦女的鮮血，不曾鼓起她們自覺的自信和光榮的紀念，而榮繞她們羔羊般的心神的：「那種犧牲是可怕的，我們應該明哲保身；甚麽意思？人生不過百年呀！」由于民主口號所給與她們的幻滅，使她們徬徨無路，只有更深的鑽到「自私」的年角尖裏，消磨那可憐的，卑怯的生命。但是，時代的經濟恐慌，不容她們「與物無爭」的活下去，幾個小學校的職位，她們相互的明爭暗鬥來奪取牠，因此，女生們的利益鬥爭，常被蒙混被利用爲某某私人位置的爭奪工具。政府各機關，没有一兩個婦女的點綴，婦運團體，更不用說，完全是一個零。</p>
<p>這樣，離鄉背井，獲得高等教育文憑的婦女，没有豪紳或更硬板的後台靠山，休想插進衡踢的教育界去。而這寥若屢星的高等知識婦女，眞也太遭——大學文憑和愛人，就是她們追求知識的目的和意義，是她們生命的歸宿。每天悠閒的坐在家裏，雅緻點的，吹吹唱唱，吟吟詠詠；世俗的，紙牌四十跑，麻雀十六　；「良妻賢母」談不到，大學文憑却像塊金字招牌，足以使她們藐視一切的寄生着。</p>
<p>幾乎是普遍的，衡陽的知識婦女的意識是封建的。對于自身的種種問題，没有較深切的理解，也没有自覺的行動。婉轉承歡于翁姑和厭惡的丈夫之下的一羣且不說，就是曾從從家長乎裏奪到婚姻自主的婦女，常常背着人眼睛哭腫，而没有勇氣跳出那已成的圈套。竟有旣不爲「愛情」，也不爲「獨身」的靑年寡婦教員。毫不害羞的在人羣裏訴說着，一陣讚美跟在嘆息後面，滑稽的塲面展開了，像演「木偶戲」。—自然，這「木偶戲」的玩弄者，不是賣藝的流浪漢，而是吃人的「禮教」。「命運論」主宰了她們，無論中年婦人或靑春少女，將一切自身的悲苦，常在一種劇烈的難堪糾緾之後，無助的低𠻨着：「註定的，没有改善的可能！」</p>
<p>因此，許多十年以前是活生生的學生或先生，而現在，除却床舖和爐灶没有天地；生的消沉，夢樣活着，不願被一個老同學看見，躱藏着如同死去一般，完全爲社會所遺忘了。</p>
<p>而活躍在社會的一羣，不曾聽過有一頁光輝生活的人。封建的威脅，「命運論」是她們的解救。憧憬于政治苦悶的，可以說，搜盡此刻的衡陽城，不會有那麽個婦女。在她們活動的範圍——學校——裏，充滿着沉滯的，没有生氣的抑壓。可憐一些受業的學生們，坐在教室裏简直是些木偶，或者靜聽一點鐘，或者照黑板抄寫一點鐘；没有自動發問的；答先生的話，那聲音是畏怯的顫抖的，怪　悶的。禮堂掛着學生們的作文圖畫和手工等等成績，刻板的模仿外，很少，甚至没有吧，創造的表現的作品。假如有提議到教育改革上，這個外來多事的傢伙便將受到冷嘲：她們不是避開正面的話鋒，一笑了之，便回答：「行不通啦，先生！這裏是一遇新奇便遭摧殘，你還想吃飯不啦？大家都一樣，馬馬虎虎的。能注入些固有知識給學生們，在我們，也算是滿意了。」這種「得過且過」的主義，就是衡陽知識婦女的人生觀，事業精神。</p>
<p>但她們的待遇，是異樣可憐的！一個縣立小學的校長，整天勞動着在學生没有自治能力的學校裏，而所得的薪資，却只有廿元多點；教書的是論鐘點算，每星期卅來往點鐘的，大堆大堆的卷子堆在案頭，夜裏要看到深夜的，也不過四十元上下。——然而，這是可觀的數目啦！幾元，十幾元的，多着多着呢。</p>
<p>簡直令人想不來，她們的生海是如何節儉着的；有些人，仍能有餘不買置産業。在她們刻苦計算的靈魂裏，閃耀着一種怎樣没落的傾向呵！……</p>
<p>說到她們的娛樂，就是消遣吧，都很少願意拿書做對象——自然她們時問很少也是原因。無聊的是，學浪蕩詞人玩弄女人的故技，」粉菊花」，「金艶紅」，津津有味的，着了迷般的，也掛在她們嘴邊，每天四開的報紙來了，首先爭看這種消息，並且朗讀着那些輕狂的捧角詩詞；興緻來時，便相率的上戲院了。此外，也有偶爾玩着牌的。世俗的餽贈和宴請，一例是，怎樣難子生活，也掙扎得起來；「體面」在她們，却是很要緊的東西。</p>
<p>庸俗，腐化，——衡陽的知識婦女們呵！我不能更詳盡的寫下去；同情梗塞着我的心，我的筆僵硬了。回憶着，總角的嬉邊，難忘的或多或少情愛的友誼，這裏，朋友們，在較高的意義上，希望着雲山遠隔的你們，視這篇輕描淡寫的東西，是一種愛的更進表現，是夢　中的一個提示。祝你們勇敢的生存！願我們更有力的再見！</p>
<h3 id="c324">剷除女子的嫉妒心 <a href="#c324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— 韻霓</p>
<p>假使我們承認心理現象是社會現象的反映，那麽，女子的嫉妒心當然也是一定的社會環境所造成的。嫉妒心不但女子有，男子也一樣地有，不過女子表現得更厲害些罷了。不用說，嫉妒是一種最没出息的卑鄙心理，因這種心理，差不多純粹是依據自私自利的個人主義，而且常常是在最狹隘的範圍或死巷内兜圈子，甚至流於最卑劣殘忍的舉動。然而最後說來，嫉妒心還不外是現社會制度之産物，私有觀念之最尖銳化與惡劣化之具體表現。所以在現社會中，凡我所没有的，或人家比我好的東西，都能引起嫉妒。在工商業中的「同行生嫉妒」，是人所共知的，甚至人家有知識，有能力，有天才，乃至生得美麗，或發明一種科學和機械等發明品，都能招來嫉妒心的光顧。利已心越重，知識越淺薄，心性越狹小（心性的狹窄與寬大有一部分是遺傳得來的）的人，嫉妒心也就越厲害—這差不多可以成爲定律。反之，能透視私有制度的構造，了解其中的關係及其必然的因果規律，具有遠大的眼光和改造社會的志願，决心犧牲自我而爲人類共同幸福奮鬥的人，則嫉妒心也就降低到最微弱的地位，甚至完會洗掉。</p>
<p>女子之所以特别富於嫉妒心，則反是由於女子之特别的歷史和特别的社會環境，家庭環境使然。在歷史上，女子是投在一種多重被壓迫被凌辱的境域中，又常被拘束於最狹小的家庭圈子之内，首先就養成了一種最狹隘的心理，其次就是種種不平和不滿的鬰積，再加是感情的豐富和理智的缺乏……，這些與私有觀念互相結合而繁榮滋長起來，便形成了嫉妒之特别活動猖狂的巢穴了。所以，女子不但看見别人比她有戲有勢要嫉妒，看見别人多有幾件衣服和首飾要嫉妒，看見别的女人比她美麗和聰明也要嫉妒，甚至大嫂子看見二嫂子生了個好看或聰明的孩子也要嫉妒，最妙的是：如守寡的母親，看見兒子同媳婦要好也要嫉妒……嫉妒之極，其至大嫂子將二嫂子的孩子害死或傷殘，母親磨折或害死媳婦種種殘忍卑劣的行爲無奇不有。抬頭現在受過所謂新式教育的女子，嫉妒心當然要减少了許多，但就一般說來，傳統的習慣還是很深，這只從機關中，學校中……女同事間之不和，團體中之互爭領袖地位，或背後互相毁謗的種種事實中，就足以證明，不過在形式上表現得文雅些聰明些，或者不現形些罷了。自然，女子中也有因改造社會志願的堅决，及自我犧牲精神的英勇而脫離了那狹小卑劣的嫉妒心的。然而這究竟是少數，女子的嫉妒和人們一般的嫉妒心，旣是屬於心理現象之一，是私有觀念的卑劣化，是社會現象的反映，那麽，我們便不能像道德家或宗教家一樣，只是單纯咀咒這人類的惡根性！嫉妒心，而應了解這種「惡根性」不過是這一定社會制度下反映出來的必然結果。要剷除這種「惡根性」，當然要從根本上改造社會入手。但從個人方面說來，尤其從女子方面說，亦應從主觀上學悟嫉妒心之可鄙，應該認識嫉妒心是破壞我們女性團結力的惡魔，是婦女解放運動途程中的大障碍，我們非從根剷除牠不可</p>
<h3 id="c325">全節堂 <a href="#c325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— 莊啓東</p>
<p>—松江旅行記之一—</p>
<p>一重門又一重門，緊緊地鎖着少婦的靑春，這封建的古宫全節堂呀！</p>
<p>當我們走到最後二重大門的時候，誰都會覺得陰深深的没一點生氣，每一重大門一都加着大鎖，大鎖以外還要加一個看守的人。</p>
<p>這一天因爲是元旦，全節堂的小孩子特别多，這些孩子是寡婦從前養的，現在，有的在學校裏念書，晚上回來，有的是整天在那裏玩的。他們的膳宿都由會節堂担負，而男孩子一到十三歲，心須離開那裏了。</p>
<p>院子裏的空氣是非常沉寂，不要說由她們看起來這是没有變化的，就是我們看來連這幾株蕭條的小樹也好像永遠是那麽没有季節地苟生着，苟生着！</p>
<p>院子的對面是一間間鄉下式的房子，一樓一底，這便是寡婦們臥室，性的拘留所。樓上和底下一樣大小，縱橫約莫有二丈左右的寬闊，據說每一間要住二份人家呢。</p>
<p>一個十六七歲的女人，坐在樓窗邊觀望着，不，說得正確點，她是在凝望着，凝望着這羣不速的旅行者，凝望着天上的幻變的雲。她若有所思地將木板窗半掩起來，失望地輕輕地搖着頭，她是在回憶啦，或者她是在想着自已以後的命運啦！</p>
<p>「這裏有多少人呀？」我問一個在我近傍的老太婆，她已經四五十歲光景，她正在一針針地縫一件男人的長袴，她停下針來，胆怯地回答：</p>
<p>「很多呀！」</p>
<p>「年紀大小都可以進來嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，不，三十以上就不能够進堂呀！</p>
<p>「那末你呢？」</p>
<p>「我嗎，」她笑起來，「從前年輕時候進堂的呀。這裏許多老太婆那一個不是年輕時候進堂的呢！」</p>
<p>這麽着，她又繼續縫起衣服來。她的臉色頓然陰沈下去，大槪她感觸到從小寡婦到老寡婦這一過程的艱難和無爲了。</p>
<p>片刻的沈默以後，我又貪婪地問她：</p>
<p>「這裏一天吃几餐呢？」</p>
<p>「三餐。」</p>
<p>「幾碗菜呢？」</p>
<p>「兩個人只有一碗菜。」</p>
<p>「葷菜還是素菜呢？」</p>
<p>「平常都是素菜。十天内有兩次大葷，四次小葷。不過節頭節面另外還加點菜。」</p>
<p>「你們可以回去嗎？」</p>
<p>「不能够，只有清明上墳時候可以回去一次。」</p>
<p>「你們的衣服，小孩子的衣服，由誰來管呢？」</p>
<p>「都是自已的。」</p>
<p>「你們那裏來錢呢？」</p>
<p>「有的是從家裏送來，有的是靠自已做活計的」</p>
<p>做活計的工鈿大嗎？」</p>
<p>「那裏會大呢，比平常總要少好幾倍。」</p>
<p>因爲我們又要到别處去參觀了，所以我提出最後一個問題來問她：</p>
<p>「你一生的希望是什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「在孩子！」</p>
<p>她驚惶地猶豫地終於這樣回答着。但是不久，她又好像否認自已般，她沮喪地搖搖頭，她不再作聲了。</p>
<p>在歸途上，我們的同伴們都滿意地偶談着：「可惜時間太怱，不能再詳細地參觀一下。」</p>
<p>「我們很運幸，能够看到這個人類的秘密了。」</p>
<p>「這裏是一面鏡子，照出女人的命運，照出一個女人的生命是怎樣歸宿的！」</p>
<h3 id="c326">杏妹妹的悲劇 <a href="#c326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>— 蓮蕊</p>
<p>前些日子接到姊的來信，知道大舅父家的杏妹妹，已到她婆家去守望門寡了。張家有錢，杏妹妹的生活費用自然不成問題，但十七歲就做寡婦，到底是很可憐的。而且她婆婆因爲要保守家産管理權的緣故，過去旣然會運動大舅母騙杏妹妹去演抱牌成婚的悲劇，現在杏妹妹說「自已願意終生守寡」，怎能担保不是她婆婆運動她說的？一個活潑的姑娘，怎麽能看一眼躺在棺材板上的未婚夫，發生愛情，願意爲他守寡呢？杏妹妹很天眞，這樣小小年紀，想必還不會使用什麽詭計。一定是她婆婆的甜言蜜語，說得她動了心，她就說是她自願的罷？</p>
<p>「大舅母眞是糊塗虫，還在希望大總統頒給節婦碑。斷送了女兒一生的幸福，去換一塊節婦碑？」這是姊信上的結語。我看了信後，呆了五六天。杏妹妹去年暑假已畢業初中，難道奾的學校教育連這一點人生知識也没有給她嗎？我幾乎不能相信這是事實。</p>
<p>在十多年以前，那是五四運動以前，我的母校也曾有過這樣的一回事。那位被騙的同學，是全校最美的一位姑娘，因爲那時還没選校花舉學校皇后等風習，所以大家祇在心裏暗羡她，並没有對她什麽榮稱。騙她的主犯是她的胞姊，原因是想將自已的兒子承嗣給她以便取得那份豐富的遺産。結果是在數年之後，原來想做節婦的貞女，因爲受不慣寡居的寂寞，一變而爲某軍閥的姨太太，頑固的父親竟登報和她脫離父女關係。但那到底是十多年前的事，我怎能相信十多年後再會有「望門寡」的犧牲者呢？不過不信儘管不信，事實終還是事實呵！這呌我深深地懷疑到現在的女子教育了。</p>
<p>「二表姊愛見，去年我逃到杭州做工，不願嫁癆病鬼，九月因跟人罷工受開除，回家後爹說他癆病已好，要我過去，我信以爲眞，兄嫂手下飯不她吃，就嫁過去，拜好天地送進新房，我得知他連拜堂的力氣都没有，我就哭着不肯同房，婆婆好說歹說，求我做好事，爲她兒子留下一塊肉，一條命根，我不要害自已，夜夜和小娘同床，爹狠心肝，不好同他商量，哥回來過年，我借他幾塊</p>
<p>錢，想逃到上海做工，不論粗工細工我都願做，總比做寡婦好，求你代我問小嬸娘，她廠裏怕要用雜工，我想寡婦不做，不如自做自吃快活，你說對嗎，祝</p>
<p>你</p>
<p>幸福。　　表妹愛蓮手上」</p>
<p>我再三再四讀蓮妹一年前給我的信，竟愈讀愈覺懁疑，爲什麽一個祇在小　讀過三年半書的表妹，反而比初中畢業的表妹有見識呢。難道是越讀越湖塗嗎？</p>
<p>我想，如果不是學校教育不同的話，一定因爲二舅父，蓮妹的父親，是種田的，大舅父是教書的從小教杏妹妹讀多了古書的緣故。可憐的杏妹妹，不知道幾時才能學悟過來？一想她到抱牌成婚的悲劇，我的心就緊縮得像喘不過氣來似的難過。</p>
<h3 id="c327">婦女與文學 <a href="#c327" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e327" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">327</a></h3>
<p>— 錢子衿</p>
<p>（一）古文學的中所反映的婦女</p>
<p>（二）婦女靈魂的發現者易卜生</p>
<p>（三）易卜生以後的婦女</p>
<p>（四）未來的婦女</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>文學反映是社會生活的一面鏡子，同時又是呼醒人類生活改進的信號。文學家用了靈妙的筆尖，反映了社會生活，暴露了社會的一切。同時又提示了社會大衆尙未認知的，新的問題給人去注意，去認識。</p>
<p>歷來人類之半數的婦女的生活，留存下來的印痕，我們可以從文學中去找尋，發現婦女人格，靈魂，使婦女覺醒而起來改進自已生活的新鮮的事跡，我們也可以到文學中去搜求。從文學以映出來的婦女的形象，我們可以清楚地看出幾千年來婦女所經過的歷程。</p>
<p>古文學中所表現的婦女，全是些没有獨立人格，没有靈魂的可憐蟲。她們不是玩物，便是奴隷。樂府子夜歌有：</p>
<p>「腕伸郎膝上，何處不可憐」，這是說明女子的目的，只是要男子覺得「可憐」。</p>
<p>再看一首古詩：</p>
<p>「上山採藦蕪，下山逢故夫；長跪問故夫，新人復何如」？是說一個女子被丈夫丢棄了，受了許多痛苦。後來上山去採野菜，回來途中遇着那無情的丈夫，她還跪下來問丈夫說「新娘子好不好」？丈夫回答她說：「新人不如你漂亮，織布也没有你快速」。</p>
<p>從這首詩看來，那被丢棄的女子，不但不敢怨恨，遇着了丈夫夫還跪下來詢問新人如何。這簡直不將自已當人看了。丈夫回答她也只說不如你漂亮，織布不如你快速。這不是明明將女人看成了奴隷？</p>
<p>西廂記裏面的崔鶯鶯，也只是一個十足的玩物，她是從頭到脚從肉體到靈魂都獻給了那色情狂的張生。</p>
<p>紅樓夢中的林黛玉，雖然寫得十分聰明，十分自重，但她處處叫人覺得可憐。那樣多愁多痛，那樣弱不禁風，可說是舊式女子的代表，舊式女子的典型。没有半介獨立的精神。一旦失却了男子的保護，或玩弄，竟不能活下去了。</p>
<p>我們再能在西洋文學中看到同樣的舊時代的没有靈魂與獨立人格的女人。屠格湼夫和柴霍甫的小說中，我們可以認識許多嫵媚而多感的女性，從左拉莫泊桑的小說中，能够看到不少優柔順從的奴隷。託爾斯泰的小說裏面，有着一個做了運命的奴隷的婀娜，克萊尼娜，湯麥斯·哈代的小說中，可以看見一個永遠逃不出惡漢手掌的台絲。</p>
<p>以往的女子，正如耶穌聖經裏面所說的「是男子身上的一枚肋骨」，附屬於男子，没有靈魂，没有人格。可知不論中外，在野蠻時代女子是同樣的不幸，同樣的做着另一種人的奴隷或玩物。她們向主子小心討好，慇懃侍候。或故作嬌態，柔順，無人憐憫。丈夫却隨心所欲，橫行一時。或使用些靈巧的本領，甜蜜的稱呼，麻醉婦女。使之堕落而不自覺。如此婦女就處在暗無天日的地下，度送他們的一生。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>婦女並不是天生的奴隷或玩物。她們原來是有着優美的靈魂與獨立的人格的。不過被長時期的壓迫與傳統的思想習慣所淹没，被瓨妙的手段本領所迷醉，而偶然的鬱憤，也就在她們自已的苦哭聲中壓平了。於是她們便變成了無靈魂的動物。她們這種非人生活，經過了一個漫長的時期，一直到偉大的文學家易卜生出世。</p>
<p>易卜生的問題劇挪拉。誰也知道是給與婦女的警鐘，使婦女覺醒的信號。點醒了數千年來婦女的迷夢，盡情地暴露了冷酷橫暴的男性的外表與内幕。他將向來男子之問的一切罪惡與欺詐，揭開　虚僞的假面，讓婦女去認識。於是從來不被人注意而婦女自已也忘却了的婦女的靈魂，驟被這位偉大的文學家發見而喚醒了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c328">靑年讀什麽書？ <a href="#c328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>— 莊明夷</p>
<p>讀書的目的在獲得知識。書籍是一種工具，人要能運用工具，駕駛工具，斯得工具的妙用。譬如木匠，須選擇銳利的鑿子斧頭等等，才能對他的業務有所帮助。讀書須精選書籍，實爲必要的工作。</p>
<p>前一時，梁啟超先生曾經發表過他的「國學必讀書目錄」，民國二十二年十月裏大晚報徵求「我所要介紹於靑年的書」，應徵的人不少，施蟄存先生就以「莊子」和「文選」兩書推薦於靑年之前。因此曾引起了一塲熱閙的筆戰。</p>
<p>所以「靑年應讀什麽書？」這種答案，實不易遽下斷語的。我以爲與其列舉一本本撒野的書名，倒不如大家來研究出幾個「應讀的書籍的選擇原則」，使有志的靑年，得根據原則去找尋適合的書籍。</p>
<p>根據吾人日常生活，應讀的書籍大槪可分三方面：（一）人生修養方面的，（二）業務智識方面的，（三）休閒教育方面的。</p>
<p>靑年正當人生改造期，個人生活和事業隨時都有修養的必要，我們雖不必崇拜偶像，但我們可以從過去的名人中，求他們所以成名的特殊的所在，所以修養方面的書籍，讀了之後，能使我們得一反省機會，作改變本人氣質的張本</p>
<p>在學生時代所求的知識，多半屬於普通教育上的智識，大學功課雖有較屬專門的研究，而實際上也因爲尙未與眞正的業務發生關係，所求的未必爲業務上有用的智識，一個出了學校門的人，他才會感覺到自已知識的缺乏，許多實用的知識太覺不够，這是什麽緣故呢？原來以前所求的知識，是空洞的，到了現在，與實際生活接觸了，才發現以前空洞學習的未必實用，或未必爲當時所注意，故欲求業務的精進，非獲得與業務有關係的智識不可。</p>
<p>關於欣賞的書籍，也同樣不能棄如敝　，眞如吃了飯，决不能不吃水。人的生活，不僅須過物質的枯燥的數目字的生活，同時也須過精神的愉快的美感的生活。文藝美術，都足以補救人生的缺憾。它們表現更眞切的人生，足以使吾人瞭解更有意義的人生。文學藝術雖不能如科學一樣有物質上的貢獻和發明，但它已盡了涵養人們情感，慰藉人們靈魂的責任。所以當每天公餘之暇，欣賞這類書籍，實是最好的休閒教育。</p>
<p>莊子說：「吾生也有涯，而知也無涯。吾人旣不能將生命有限的光陰，完全消耗在無窮的書堆中，則又豈可不從浩如烟海的書籍中，找出我們所需要的書籍來？</p>
<p>霍勃斯曾封人說：「我倘若也像别人一樣多讀書，恐怕也將像别人一樣的没有學問了。」他並不是呌人不要讀書，實在是呌人不必濫讀書，就是說，讀書應謹愼選擇。</p>

<h3 id="c329">「鉛桶」 <a href="#c329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>— 孫福山</p>
<p>鉛桶是什麽東西，用不着我來說明了，你看那一家不用着鉛桶，眞是一種普遍到無以復加的物事了。我是怎樣地和鉛桶發生關係的呢？說來話長。那是在鄉裏，去年遇着大旱災，没有辦法的人，聽說上海容易生活，都跑到上海來了，我就是這逃荒羣中的一個。</p>
<p>自然在街頭站着，或者是踱來踱去的看人們的臉色不是一個長久的辦法，因此，找職業的念頭就跑到我腦子裏來了。窮親戚們也覺得我很聰明，費了不少的力氣，托人又再托人的算是在鉛桶店裏替我補上了一個學徒的職位。條件是：跟着師傳做，有飯吃，每月給我二十個銅子的剃頭費。這還是親朋們多方面的說情，鉛桶老板認爲當作好事似的才肯收留的。</p>
<p>起先老板教我把裁好的鉛皮用木方敲成一個圓形，不到幾分鐘我就學會了。經過一個禮拜的光景，他才教我剪鉛皮；只要你會拿剪刀，會在鉛皮上畫綫，這有什麽困難呢！後來經過了一個月吧，他才教我「滾邊」，「敲底」，至於「走漢」他却始終不肯教我。我知道他在做鬼，他深怕我學會了要逃跑的一樣，我眞氣極了，這简直是一種侮辱。其實要學會做一個鉛桶有什麽難呢，總共不到半點鐘我都學會了。我以前還在高等小學校畢過業哩！有一天，師傳不在家，我就偷偷的做了一個完完全全的，居然走了漢，不漏水，和師傳做的一樣。我眞高興極了。你道後來師傳曉得了怎麽樣？他駡道：「他媽的！你倒很聰明！」很不耐煩的樣子，有當天晚上，借個故，把我痛痛快快的打了一頓。</p>
<p>在剛進店的幾天我很歡喜，過後就不同了。做鉛桶的時間並不多，大槪每天有七八個鐘頭，或則是五六個鐘頭。也有趕夜工的時候，那是要一天忙到晚，要到夜間兩三點鐘才得睡覺的，我們呌這樣的日子做「闖鬼」。在不「闖鬼」的時候，也是一樣不得閒的，總有許多事要做。不過，可以早一點睡覺罷了。晚上十點半鐘睏，第二天早晨不到六點鐘就要起來，去倒馬子，掃地，打開舖門。做一點鐘的活，又要去生火爐替老板和老板娘燒水洗臉。買菜回來，做早飯的事也要我去動手。總之，一天除了做活，燒飯，就是抱小孩子。我自已雖然還是個小孩，我總喜歡小孩子，但是老板這孩子我非常恨，眞是嬌養得不成個樣子，三歲多了還成天的要人抱，要吃什麽就得吃什麽，假如他一不高興哭起來，老板娘凖有幾個巴掌會打在我臉上的。和我一樣吃着苦頭的在店裏還有一個，也是十五歲，同我是「老根」，我們兩個很要好</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，甚麽事都是商商量量的做。他們的算盤眞就精明呢，買小菜也不能讓我和他同去，總是不讓誰閒着的。</p>
<p>大槪是因爲趕了夜工，和買菜着了雨的緣故吧，我的「老根」生病了。起初他們都没有說什麽，在第三天上，他們說：「病老是不好，睡着吃，還要别人服侍他，呌他滾吧！」我聽着這些話眞是傷心，我想我們在做「鉛桶」，自已就眞像一隻「鉛桶」，「鉛桶」假如生了鏽出個洞的時候，總是被人扔在一邊，有誰來理他哩！</p>
<h3 id="c330">看了「桃李刧」 <a href="#c330" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e330" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">330</a></h3>
<p>— 慶音</p>
<p>「桃李刧」在近頃的影壇上可算是一個相當優異的收獲。這不只是牠在技術上有相當的成　，也是牠在内容上接觸到了現實的問題。這個戲的能够激動觀衆並賺取人們的眼淚，到底是並非偶然而有着牠不同凡響的所在的。</p>
<p>首先我們不能忘懷的，是舞臺人在這裏的努力及其成績的難能。作爲這個戲的演出特色的是無臺人初登銀幕大會串的這件事。實際，從編劇，導演，以至演員，舞臺人都幹了自已的脚色，並且都幹得没有塌自已的臺。本來，舞臺演技和銀幕演技就没有什麽本質上的不同，從舞臺得來的訓練和修養，同樣是可以帮助一個演員在銀幕上成功的。「桃李刧」的成績恰好就說明了這一事實。「桃李刧」中的主要演員演技的不穏及情感過程的充分，都是得之於舞臺的賞賜的。雖表演中不乏過火和誇張的地方，這也許是一個小毛病，但實際這種塲面有時反能獲得意外的效果，這在「桃李刧」中是找得出這種地方，在歐美的許多由舞臺劇改編的影片中，特别是在名片「二十世紀快車」中，也是可以很容易的找得出這種地方的。</p>
<p>編劇技術上値得一提的是追叙法的運用和歌曲的安插。從老校長探監而使故事在回憶的叙述中進行，比平舖直叙要顯得曲折有致而不落凡俗。「畢業歌」在行畢業禮時唱來只是作爲故事的進展而顯得必需，在男主人公犯罪卽將行刑的回憶塲合中唱來，却喚起了人們對於「畢業卽失業」這一事實的感慨。這不但增加了這個戲的悲劇的氣氛，同樣也因了那嘹亮的聲音而很自然的在觀衆的腦膜上刻下了一層沉痛深刻的印象。</p>
<p>導演稱職。爲了是第一次戲身銀幕，免不了的有部分的缺點，例如對於人物個性，特别是陶建平的個性，把握得不够明確，情感過程有時也嫌過速了一點，但這都是小毛病，他在心理描寫和空氣上不也是顯得很有能力的嗎？</p>
<p>最後，不能無言的是這個戲所代表的不甚健全的内容。我們不能否認，劇作者在剪取題材上是看到現實了，但可惜的是他並不曾合理的解釋並反映這現實。他只看到現實的浮面，而没有從根本上去探究現實的本質。「畢業卽失業」的事實，只是作爲一個偶然的事象而解釋着；只是因爲主人公陶建平自視甚高，不肯忍耐，才招致了失業的悲慘和不幸。假設他是能够「忍耐」的，失業的浪潮就不會捲到他的身上來了。這何異於痴人說夢？在現社會體制下，絶難容許人們這末樂觀。假設大中學生都能像陶建平那樣先後找到了輪船公司的職位，建築師，或勞力的工作，那「畢業卽失業」這句話，就無異是一句可笑的謊語。可是不幸得很，這句話恰好代表了一件難於改變的嚴重的事實。這一點正好說明了劇作者對於社會認識的膚淺和浮面。可是電影藝術是不該停留在這種膚淺的浮面上的，牠應該往事象的裏層探究，闡明事象的内在，指明事象發展的方向。不然的話，在整個作品的評價上，就不能不打一些折扣了。我認爲「桃李刧」就該打這末些折扣，因爲牠的技術上的若干的成就到底不是整個作品的成就。——雖說牠仍不失爲一部値得推薦，値得一看的片子。</p>

<h3 id="c331">法意協定之剖視 <a href="#c331" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e331" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">331</a></h3>
<p>— 少門</p>
<p>大戰以後，法意衝突的表現在其程度上，幾乎不亞於德法的矛盾。無論在地中海，在北非洲，在中歐，在巴爾幹，法國和意大利的衝突都鮮明地表現了出來。馬賽慘劇發生以後，法國的三大衛星之一的南斯拉夫更鮮明而又具體地表示了仇意態度，同時莫索里尼也不示弱，採取了對南的强硬政策，一時之間，歐洲形勢又行嚴重起來，大有再來一次大戰之勢。乃此慘劇所流的血跡尙未乾去，法新外長賴伐爾行抵羅馬的消息卽被傳了出來，隨卽全世界的報紙都刋出了「歐戰後一頁新史」—法意恊約簽字的新聞；而仇意的南斯拉夫也與羅馬尼亞和捷克一同表示了維護此項恊約的態度。此種情形，當然是要引起人們的驚異的。</p>
<p>本來，歐戰的結果，法國卽挾凡爾賽和約以壓制德人，稱覇歐洲，力主維持戰後的現狀，對此不僅德國拚命反對，卽意大利也因爲這和約所造成的現狀於已不利，而　成了修約的主張。但希特勒登臺以後，一方面因其大唱重整軍備，廢除和約的高調，使法國受到了極大的威脅，另一方面又困其積極進行合併奧大利，復使意國深感不安。在此情形下，法國爲要保持其戰後的勝利品，便努力緩和法意間的衝突，以阻止德國的毁約企圖。至於意大利，則亦因爲要保持其在中歐的現有地位及其發展途徑，不願德奧合併成爲現實，一時之問，也想聯結法國以對付德人。雖然法意的矛盾非常複雜尖銳，但它們在某一相同的利害關係上，却是隨時都在設法有條件地緩和其矛盾以謀一時之妥恊的。最近在羅馬簽字的法意恊約，就是法意兩國在德國對外的不穏趨勢之下，而相互地以各種條件來緩和其矛盾，謀得一時之妥恊的表現。</p>
<p>據報載，法意恊約共分四部，其内容大意如下：</p>
<p>一·法國允以意屬里比亞以南十一萬四千方公里之士地讓與里比亞；並以法屬索謀里蘭所轄巴貝爾曼特海峽對面之海岸綫讓與意屬愛里德里。……</p>
<p>二·意大利得參加自法屬古布底至阿比西尼亞京城阿提斯阿巴巴之鐵道經營權。</p>
<p>三·法意共同建議，凡奧國各隣邦及奧國應相互訂結不干涉及不侵略之恊定，法國，波蘭，羅馬尼亞，亦得加入該恊定，俾遇奧國土地完整遭遇威脅時，各國得與奧國舉行磋商。……</p>
<p>四·關於軍備權平等問題，法意兩國政府根據一九三二年十二月十一日英美法德意五强宣言，共同承認無論何國</p>
<h3 id="c332">觀冷燕歌舞團表演後 <a href="#c332" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e332" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">332</a></h3>
<p>— 萍遙</p>
<p>冷燕歌舞團跑了北平天津靑島等幾個碼頭之後，現在又到了上海，他們已在東南，華德，恩派亞等幾個影戲院裏表演過了。他們這次的表演，代表了歌舞界的另一傾向，就是他們不以肉感號召觀衆，而傾全力於歌舞本身的技術上的注意這件事。這是可注目的一點。</p>
<p>說到技術，則無論在歌，舞，音樂方面，都頗有値得一提的地方。前「霞影」歌舞團臺柱現爲冷燕要角的路易斯小姐就是賦有歌喉的，她的「獨唱」，就够惹人注意。舞蹈方面，該團曾在天津請了一個俄國舞蹈師教授了多時，故演來堪稱熟練，而舞姿亦多帶有一種異國風味。節目中如「哥薩克舞」，「俄宫艶舞」，「探戈舞」，「吉潑西舞」，「法蘭西舞」……等大都代表了一個民族性，又具有一種種健而有力的舞姿，都頗能引人曯目。音樂方面，該團樂隊組織尙稱完備，隊員七人大都有樂藝素養，故成績不下於上海之歌舞團。此外，話劇「千方百計」（這個戲是在上海演過多次的），由該團劉茫路易斯女士二人主演，雖佈景方面不免嫌簡單一些，但二人的演技則頗有可觀處。至於這個戲内容的陳舊，那是另外一件事，這裏且不去說牠。</p>
<p>最後，我想說一說對該團的希望。歌舞的宜改變傾向，該團是已經看到的了，但歌舞的宜有新的創造，則該團怕尙未十分注意及之。模仿别人無論如何是不够的。自已應當有藝術化的，適合大衆欣賞而又健美有力的新的創作的創製，方能適合廣大觀衆的要求。不然的話，則在營業上將難取得勝利，在歌舞藝術本身的發展上也難以有什麽表現。不知該團諸公其亦以鄙意爲然否？</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>不得以單方之行動，變更關於軍備之義務；關於此一問題，遇有必要時，兩國政府得相互磋商。</p>
<p>這很顯然地表示着：一面由法國讓與一些在非洲的殖民地的土地和權利給意大利，以相當地滿足其急於擴張非洲殖民地之慾望；同時由法國及其衛星小恊約國與意大利共同保障奧國之獨立，阻止德奧合併，以保持其由奧國走向巴爾幹之出路；另一方面則是意大利不侵擾南斯拉夫，不傷害法國在巴爾幹的利益，與法國及小恊約國共維持奧國獨立及歐洲和平（卽是共同維持歐洲的現狀），以保障那早已被人撕毁了的凡爾賽和約的某些效用，使法國在大戰中所得的利益因以保存。——所謂法意恊定，便是在這樣的條件下成立的。其第一作用，當然是在緩和法意間的衝突，並於某一點上共同監視德國。</p>
<p>然而，戰後的德國却非向外找出路不可。在這中間，德國所走的道路不外兩條：一是實現德奧合併，進窺巴爾幹與法意抗爭，一是北向波羅的海，東侵蘇聯。但最近的事實表現，却說明了前一途徑阻碍甚大，不易走通，使其不得不把眼光全移東方，走後一道路。如德國之結好波蘭，希特勒之删去其自傳中仇法的語句，國社黨人之一再發表「和平」言論，德法退伍軍人之聯歡等等，都是德國這一傾向的顯然例證。法國呢？自然要保障其自身之「安全」，不讓德國起來復仇，但倘使德國眞的不走西出的道路，直向東方前進，那它也是贊同的，這裏的問題，乃是在於法國不能相信德國眞的放棄其復仇的懷抱，不攻打巴黎，假如在歐陸上能得到意大利乃至英國之贊助，一同來監視德國實行其東進政策，那法帝國主義便可在有力的帮助之下躱開了他的敵人，使之與他人爭鬭，這對於牠又有什麽不好呢？本來法國對德的辦法不外這兩者間之一：在德國未恢復元氣之前，先對德國舉行一個防禦戰，使之無法再起；希望德國東進，避去德法間的正面衝突。但前者是很危險的，因爲不能得到英意之贊助；後者易於得到英意之贊助和保障，却是很「安全」的。所以，只要可能，法國當然要採取後一政策。最近簽字的法意恊定，除了法意兩國用以監視德國不傷害它們的利益外，更有使德國的外出由西向東的意味：這當然是英法意外交政策之結果。蘇聯「伊斯維斯太」報贊同了英報對這問題的分析，說道：「羅馬談判，正如英報所言，將爲一種願爲德法之間建設橋樑創製若干有利條件之表現，英國外交家正循此方向努力，此事無他，僅爲獲取德國方面適量之高調與文件，而允許德國軍擴之合法權利耳。」在公布的法意恊約中雖未見有許可德國重整軍備的條文，但我們相　法意乃至於英國對此問題必有具體的談論。如事前英外相西門之遊行法國，事後英國之表示歡慰，法總理與外長之將往訪倫敦，賴伐爾之擬遊柏林，法國最近對於東歐互助公約之冷淡，英人之公然主張廢除和約中的軍事條欵，已死的軍縮會議之「甦生」表現，德國重返軍縮的聲浪之遍傳歐美，……——所有這些，都透露出了羅馬恊定之另一作用：「爲法德之間建設橋樑創製若干有利條件」，「允許德國軍擴之合法權利」，以便其東進。</p>
<p>然而，夜長夢多，一切事件之發展是否如歐洲列强的打算，却還是一個値得研究的問題。</p>

<h3 id="c333">現實與希望 <a href="#c333" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e333" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">333</a></h3>
<p>— 飛鵬</p>
<p>希望和現實是人類生存的兩重活力。不管現實怎樣使你不美滿，使你厭倦，失望，但再壞的現實你仍不能突然離開它。因爲人是已經生活於現實中了，絶没有完全無現實而可以生活的道理。現實是人類所不能擺脫的。穿衣，吃飯，住房子，交朋友，過性生活，做你正做和想做的事，說你正說和想說的話，都是現實。每個人就在這現實中生活，每個人的生活也表現爲他個人的現實。没有現實就没有人生。</p>
<p>現實雖是每一個人的生命内容和生活條件，可是任何時代和任何個人的現實，都會使他不能滿足，因而不能不有另一種希望作爲生活的動力。否則人類不但不能進步，而且卽連這已有的現實也要保持不了，生活不下去了。因爲不管一個人所希望的能否在將來成爲現實，但他總要有一個希望才成功，也總已有一個希望。一個掌握最高權力的人，那怕他已爬上了人類社會的塔形組織之最高尖頂，但他還是有他的未來希望。所以古代的帝王如秦始皇漢武帝之流，他們還希望長生不老，遣人入海或築露臺以求神仙。别的最高權力的掌握者，則希望自已能够永保他的地位不至動搖。商人在賠本後固然希望把本撈轉來，就是賺了錢的人也希望能更多賺些。工人希望着明天能加工資，一月多有點收入。農民希望着明年比今年更能豐收。寫文章的人希望稿費高點，每篇文章都能賣得出去。女人找着了丈夫，還希望早生兒子，再娶媳婦，抱孫子。總之，一大堆的未來生活的憧憬，是成爲每一個人的希望和幻想，而縈繞在腦海裏，搆成了他的生命和生活的一部分。希望，簡單地說來，它是人類在不滿現實中要求安慰自已，補足現實的缺陷的慾求。人們有了一種希望，卽可以安慰自已，繼續活下去。希望是憧憬未來，但它就以此增加了人類的奮鬥力和勇氣。人類必須要有希望，要有引誘他的未來憧憬，然後他才能向前猛進。人類的進步在這裏，生活的燃燒力和推進力也在這裏。如果人類没有希望心，恐怕他早就停留在野蠻社會而不能前進了。如果個人没有希望心去燃燒他的内心，因而成爲失望者，那他必定會走到自殺的前途的！</p>
<p>這樣看來，希望和現實又是矛盾的又是恊調的。因爲没有現實，你是已經不存在的了，那裏還有甚麽希望呢？没有希望，你亦不能生活着享受現實，繼續創造現實，一切已有和未來的現實，也都在你的失望中消失下去了。而且一方面是只有現實給你以經騐，才能感覺滿足或厭棄，因而發生希望。他方面則只有希望才能使你去創造不斷的現實，創造起來作爲你的生活延續中的現實。然而現實和希望又是矛盾的。因爲没有對於現實的不滿，就不會使你發生希望，而把握未來的希望向它走去，也就是使你抛開現實。反之，如果你安於現實的滿足而把握着它不願放棄，那就是說你没有别的希望，抛棄了未來。換一句話説，就是完全站在現實上一步也不肯離去，那就没有希望的必要，希望就消失了，現實是如此否定着希望。又如完全空想着未來的希望，或簡直不講現實，那你是没有生活的内容和生存的可能，現實就消失下去了，希望亦如此否定着現實。現實要你停留在它懷裏不讓你離開，而希望却要你離開現實跟着它向前跑，它們就這樣互相矛盾互相否定着。因爲如此，所以正當的人生，經常是脚踏在兩條船上的：旣要把握現實，也要樹立希望，追求未來。現實與希望的恊調，在維持你的生命，現實與希望的矛盾，也在創造你的生命。人是生活在矛盾中的，矛盾就是生命之流，就是引導生命的火炬。</p>
<p>然而，世界上却有着兩種可怪的人：一種人則專門教人安於現實，說你們不要不滿於現實來和現實對立，你們的希望是幻想，不要離開實際而趨於幻想，應該抛開希望，抛開幻想而完全聽命於現實的安排。現實呌你怎樣生活就怎樣生活，雖然在現實中蒙着很深的痛苦，也得這樣生活下去，對抗現實就是罪惡。可是他們不知道没有對於現實生活的不滿，厭倦，抗爭和將它抛棄，就不會由此憧憬將來而發生希望，以此作爲他的推進力，這樣，人類就不會進化，個人就會因失望而消極甚至自殺。亦有一種人則專門教人希望未來，特别是宗教家是如此。他們說現實誠然是痛苦，但你們應該完全忘掉現實的痛苦，忍受着現實的捉弄，去希望將來的補償罷。這完全是拿將來的希望作爲催眠劑，催眠病人使他忘却疾病的痛苦的辦法，這辦法同樣是不許人和現實對立的。他們不知道完全不講現實而希望未來，這是使人們立刻失掉生存的依據，使人們失掉現實的立足地以後，亦不能創造未來，達到希望。很顯然的，比如吃飯，穿衣都是現實，如果没有飯吃，没有衣穿，人都餓死，凍斃了，還有甚麽將來可希望的呢？</p>
<p>總之，人類不是單生活於現在，也不是現在的生活就是美滿的止境。他還要生活於將來，生活於較爲美滿的生活中。所以他應當生活於現實中，亦當生活於希望中。要能對現實不滿才能發生希望，也要能在現實中生活才能去創造將來，實現他的希望。要現實也要未來的希望，要對抗現實也要不專門幻想未來。這雖似乎是矛盾的，然而這矛盾就是人類的生活法則，也是人類的歷史演進法則。</p>

<p>五四運動以來，詩的形體算已得了解放，然而除了早期的急就章而外，還有什麽收獲呢？</p>
<p>我們的詩壇沈寂極了，我們只一返顧那些濫觴於北歐的沈雄豪偉的詩篇，西歐的　　温馨的歌章，島國的纎麗藴藉的誹句，不禁悲苦我民族精神的消沉和堕落。詩歌是一個民族靈魂的呼聲，她會喊出大衆苦悶的情緒，她會表揚出一個民族獨特的精神，然而我們的詩壇沈寂得幾至没有動靜了。</p>
<p>中國是個不適於爲文化努力者生長的土地，只要看近數年來社會對待文人的薄倖，甚至虐待，卽已瞭然這種悲慘的事實。詩人朱湘投江自殺了，彭家煌在貧病交迫的日子中消逝了。文化水凖一般的落低，讀者購買力一般的薄弱，出版界自一九三三年起，也泛濫着不景氣的怒潮，新書以一元三斤作估計，文章以一元千字作代價；詩人生當這個時代，他的一行行的詩句，更有誰來顧惜呢？詩壇的沈寂，這是一個原因。</p>

<h3 id="c335">耍燈 <a href="#c335" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e335" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">335</a></h3>
<p>— 濤人</p>
<p>在貴州，新年裏，最快樂，最熱閙而又最有趣的一件事，怕就要算是「耍燈」吧。燈有若干種，如像「龍燈」「獅子」，「花燈」，「車車燈」等等。這差不多是貴州任何一縣或鄉　裏都熱烈地舉行着的。「耍燈」的意義有兩個：一則是慶賀新年，凑凑熱閙，再則是這些「燈」都各自代表了一種神，這些神的責任，是在「保一街清潔，佑四海平安」的。</p>
<p>耍「龍燈」是一個極其隆重的曲禮。龍是用竹篾造形，糊上紙，再畫上所謂龍應該具備的彩色條紋，龍衣子是布做的，身段長有十二洞或十五洞。出龍是從初九到十五爲止。在龍的前面有若干排燈，紥成蝦兵蟹將水族類奇奇怪怪的樣子，還另外紥有八仙。接着，鑼鼓喧天中，「龍燈」出現了。耍龍是耍「放花」的，你祗見「龍燈」在火熖裏打滾，而「花」也有很多的巧妙，有的放出來顔色是藍的，也有白色的，也有紅色的，人們在製「花」的時候，或者在當中隔上一層紙頭，使牠放得正帶勁時忽然中斷，或者在火藥裏擱下一點「潮瑙」，使牠放時發出劇烈的吼聲，幾乎要爆裂的樣子。在這許多陪襯之下，「龍燈」的「龍」眞像是活生生地出現，有遨遊千里的氣慨。觀衆是途爲之塞的，往往因爲「龍柄」打壞了人，要惹起不少的糾紛。</p>
<p>「耍獅子」是在白天，到初二你就可以見着。耍「平地獅子」倒没有甚麽，不過是將獅子的一切生活習慣，表演一番罷了。但「台上獅子」可眞要令人呌絶的，「越角」，「穿台」不算希奇，最使人胆寒的是爬上四十一顆板櫈，或者七十一顆板櫈架成的高台，還要在上面做很多戲，而台又戰戰兢兢的幾乎要倒下來的樣子。從下面玩上去，可從上面玩下來。除獅子外，還有一個「笑頭羅漢」和一個「孫猴子」。在頂上一顆一顆的把板櫈拆下來是「孫猴子」的責任，在每一顆板櫈上總要打一個翻觔斗，或者是舉鼎。呵，我忘記告訴你獅子是怎樣做成的了，獅子的頭是硬紙做的，頭上有九色，有鈴，嘴巴是活動的，身子是用布剪成個渾圓有弧樣的形接在頭上，用兩個人披上獅子的假面，一人耍頭，一人耍尾，人足就等於獅子的四隻足。這裏我得把我的幾位「老表」誇奬一番，他們的玩藝是鐵鍊純靑的，假如你造新房子要獅子去踩樑的話，他們可以穿上釘鞋（在木上極滑，很重。）在樑上打滾，轉彎，掉頭看不出絲毫破錠。</p>
<p>「花燈」和「車車燈」是比較平淡的，但也有牠低級的趣味。兩種燈的主角都是一個少女，一個小丑，也喊呌「兜么妹」，有說有唱的，簡直是亂七八糟的話都說得出來；不過也得有個系統，有個故事。他們要到人家户去玩燈，遇着門關上的話可就麻煩了，那得耍「說接連」；倘兩方都是内行的話，眞是犖犖大言，可以談到二三點鐘，從「天上有幾顆星」，一直談到「爲什麽耍玩燈」，和「請主人家開財門」，是應該口若懸河，不能打頓的，不然，可名譽掃地了。這也是初九出燈到十五日爲止。「車車燈」和「花燈」不同的是，「車車燈」的么妹老是在紙糊的車箱裏不能下地，而且是不能進人家堂屋的，因爲牠代表的神最小，據說是一個産婦的緣故。</p>

<p>然而，這偌大的地域上，到底還有刻苦蠻幹的人存在着。「火山」詩刋，終於在少數年靑詩人的奮鬥中，於一九三四年的歲尾，以嶄新的姿態出現於我人的眼前。</p>
<p>這一件事，將成爲一九三五年的奇蹟。</p>
<p>我讀她的創刋號，在一個人靜的午夜。讀罷，腦海裏充滿着一幅幅人間苦悶的圖畫，她唱道：</p>
<p>牠們無風而自落了</p>
<p>落在多垢的枕上</p>
<p>棕金色的古舊的棉袍上</p>
<p>翻開的書頁上</p>
<p>塗滿了果醬的熱烘烘的麵包上XXXX</p>
<p>秋來了</p>
<p>梧桐樹撒下她的絳色的小小的舟</p>
<p>而我的樹頂上</p>
<p>落下一根根長長的絲狀的葉</p>
<p>黑色的，無光澤的，柔而細的葉</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>這些落葉啊</p>
<p>從我的樹頂上落下來的</p>
<p>使我深深地留戀而悲哀</p>
<p>—路易士的「髮」</p>
<p>路易士的作品，以往在「現代」上已有不少的貢獻。他的抒情詩，雖然罩上一重悲哀的濃霧，但纖細的筆觸，幽抑的音調，是他特有的作風。</p>
<p>天</p>
<p>滴你的藍色的瓊漿在我眼中</p>
<p>灑你的藍色的香粉在我頭上</p>
<p>啊，可愛的十月天</p>
<p>翻你的藍色的軟軟的浪</p>
<p>掀你妙齡女的藍色的長長的裙</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>你以無限奧秘的藍色</p>
<p>覆蓋着我</p>
<p>覆蓋着梧桐樹和大地</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>傾聽你無限奧秘的</p>
<p>藍色的催眼歌</p>
<p>我逐徐徐地閉上沈醉的眼</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>梧桐樹顫抖於你的催眠歌</p>
<p>不停地搖着</p>
<p>她的金色的肩膀</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>於是</p>
<p>這個灰色而無言的大地</p>
<p>也快入睡了</p>
<p>我聽到了我們的詩人底心靈的震顫了。</p>
<p>烏鴉來了</p>
<p>唱黑色之歌</p>
<p>投我的悲哀在地上</p>
<p>碎如落葉</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>片片落葉上</p>
<p>駄着窒息的夢</p>
<p>疲憊煩重的心</p>
<p>乃乘鴉背以遠颺</p>
<p>這是我們終日閉塞在勞苦悲哀的鐵桶中的慘呌，借着詩人美化的筆，由低沈的節拍中發洩出來了。</p>
<p>不必再多舉這種例子，總之，讀過了這種詩，心頭雖是感到無限的沈重，但肉體上却反得到無限的舒徐，像四肢百骸都已酥散似的。</p>
<p>「火山」中路易士丁辛老邁等，都是有前途的靑年熱情詩人，我望他們除在刻苦中自勵外，更須豐富他們自已的生活體騐，找到新詩的新的途徑，更希望社會不再給這一顆新栽的鮮葩以冷酷的摧殘。我寫本文時，心腔裏是包含着多少的熱望啊！</p>

<h3 id="c339">愛因斯坦傳（一） <a href="#c339" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e339" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">339</a></h3>
<p>— 從木</p>
<p>亞爾巴特，愛因斯坦，是世界聞名的現代科學上的大革命家。他的「相對性原理」出世，不僅推翻了在科學上曾經支配二百餘年的有名的牛頓力學，在物理學上在整個自然科學上投下了一顆足以變動一切的劇烈的炸彈，而且對於近代哲學近代思想都起了莫大的影響，使各種觀念論的理論各種機械的玄妙的思想都不得不更加顯示其謬誤的姿態。所以，我們可以說，不知道愛因斯坦的學術及其生平的人，是不會全部地了解現代科學哲學現代思想之變遷發展的。</p>
<p>關於愛因斯坦的傳記及其學術的有系統的著作，在我們的出版界中我至今還没有見到。我現在要向大家介紹愛因斯坦，是依據最近日本出版的「愛因斯坦傳」（桑木或雄著）來做我的工作的；但這是一本較大的書，我不能把牠全部地翻譯出來，當作一篇文章來發表，所以我只能依據此書簡要地來編述「愛因斯坦傳」，如果因此能使大家對於這位現代的偉大的科學家—愛因斯坦有相當的了解時，那就算是我的精力没有白費了。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>愛因斯坦於一八七九年三月十四日生於南德意志的甫爾母市。這地方是在流貫德奧的多腦河上流的左岸，向來是一個交通的要地。五六百年以前，在這裏建立了一個哥提克式的大寺院，其尖塔有百六十一米突高，實是世界最高的寺院建築。愛因斯坦是被認爲達到世界科學史上最高峯的人，而他就是在有世界最高寺院的建築地方誔生的，這不是很有趣味的事情嗎？</p>
<p>愛氏誔生六年以後，他的全家便遷到　恩去了，共少年時代卽是在此度過的。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦才四五歲時，他的父親就把一個小小的羅盤給他玩，當時他對於那盤中磁針之搖動就發生了不可思議的感覺，待他父親作了一番說明之後，他仍覺不能解釋其驚異。又，也是在那時候，他的一個從妹由基那到來，談了一些關於意大利的土地，人物，港灣，船舶等等的事情，他聽了之後，始則驚異着世界之廣大，隨卽從他父親的工塲中取出一隻舊箱子來，做倣傚航海的遊戲。—這雖不能算是他之成爲偉大的科學家之徵兆，但他的這樣的性格與其成就多少總是有點關係的。</p>
<p>可是，由於這些事情的刺激，由於他之感到自然的不可思議與廣大，把他引導到統一自然與神的汎神教的宗教心裏去了。他的父親受了功利的時代思想，是一個自由思想家，不重視宗教，在自已的家庭中不行猶太的儀式，但對於愛因斯坦，郤是希望其嚴格地遵守猶太的規律的。</p>
<p>待到滿六歲的時候，愛因斯坦就進小學讀書了。但他對於他所處的小學校的規則，對於學校的設備，對於學校之對貧富兒童待遇不平等現象，在那時就深深地感到了不滿。同時，因爲他是猶太人，在小學生活中，也就開始受到了反猶太人的痛苦。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦自小就嗜好藝術，尤其喜歡音樂。他的母親也好彈鋼琴，喜歡古典的東西，他在六歲的時候就開始學梵啞鈴了，所以待他成人時，他的音樂知識也就有了相當的根底。</p>
<p>他的中學教育也是在廟恩受的。他所住的學校，是以實行希臘，拉丁的古典教育爲主的中學。但他對於這個中學的感印，也和他對其所住的小學的感印一樣，是機械的，施行無靈魂的教育的學校。不過，那裏有一個呌做吕斯的教師，曾發了一些希臘，羅馬，古典的德意志文學的講義，這引起了他對於古典文學的興味。據他在三十歲時所說，在他已經發表了關於相對論的最初論文的兩三年之後，在他的名字已爲學術界的一部分人注意了的時候，他曾特别去訪問過這位舊老師；但這位老師向來就未把他記在心裏，反而露出怪他何故來訪問的神色，於是，他感到了大大的幻滅，怱怱地辭去了。</p>
<p>少年時代的愛因斯坦，在數學的才能上顯示了早熟的情况。他在十三歲時，就把初等幾何學的教科書，學到學校的課程的前面去了。可是，他與楊格和哈米爾頓不同；這兩人不但是早熟科學家，而且語學的才能也是早熟的，愛因斯坦的數學才能雖顯示出驚人的早熟，但其語學郤是很平庸的。他在某次考試時，曾因語言和博物的成績太壞而失敗過。</p>
<p>對於哲學書籍，愛因斯坦也很喜歡，當時流行的畢希那的「力與物質」曾給了他以很深的印象，他日益接近唯物的一元論，但他從小就有的宗教心理郤還未被完全消滅；在他的學校也有猶太教的教育，教師德克特爾，勃爾來斯給與了他難於忘記的宗教的銘感。</p>
<p>在他快要卒業中學的時候，他的家庭發生了一個大的變化。他父親所經營的電氣事業蹉跌了，使他的一家不得不離開廟恩，而遷到了意大利，但愛因斯坦仍要留在廟恩　直到共卒業的時候。</p>
<p>愛氏對他父親的事業木無興趣，他從不到他父親的工塲裏去。對於廟恩的街市生活的一切，也是没有什麽興味的。他只是想着意大利，因爲他曾經聽到過由　　來的他的從妹的一些關於意大利的話，他卽以爲意大利是今世的樂土；而他的雙親那時是在這個樂土的地方，在其通信中使他想像着意大利是如何的光明，如何的自由，一天，他竟迅速地走到他的雙親面前了。因爲他很想到意大利去，所以不待卒業，他就乞求醫師，以神經衰弱的理由得到了休學證明書。自此以後，半年中，他是完全脫離了學校生活的。在光明的大陽之下，在色彩濃艶的北意大利的風景之中，與米拉羅的自由的靑年人交遊。</p>

<h3 id="c345">情聖乎？浪子乎？范朋克氏心目中的唐璜 <a href="#c345" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e345" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">345</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>唐璜Don　Juan，恐怕大家都知道的吧。他到底是什麽的一種人，英雄嗎？流氓嗎？抑或他是冀望着得到美滿愛情的風流聖手？還是以女人爲娛樂的色情狂者？像這樣。問題，倘若對唐璜没有深切的研究和了解，實在是不容易下斷語的。他有這麽多的嬌妻美妾，風流韻事，廣播塵環。像這樣的一個人，你可以說他是上述的怎樣的一個呢？</p>
<p>不久以前，范朋克氏離開了好萊塢到歐洲製片。在名導演亞力山大柯達之領導下，他已攝竣一張關於唐璜一生風流事實的巨片「美人心」“Tbe　PrivateLife　of　Don　Juan”，（將在本埠南京大戲院公映）。爲了這事，他實地的走到西班牙的西衛爾—唐璜的故居—去詳究他一生的事跡。他了解唐璜一生的苦悶，知道他的情衷並不是外人們所想像的這麽瘋狂浪漫。他知道唐璜是一個唯心論者。一個思想過敏，情感獨富的大情人。他終身的光陰都化在追求他心目中的一位十全十美的女人。比較的他以住在西衛爾的時間爲最長久，但這是没有甚麽重要的，祇是因爲西衛爾是他的故鄉罷了。他終其一生的去追求他理想中十全十美的愛人，可是這種追求，始終都給他失望。因爲他所理想的女人，是太好了，太完美了，根本就没有這樣的一個女人，而且是永遠不會有的。他日夜所追求的，祗是詩人所幻想的，音樂家所奏出的，和一般藝術家們所創造的，並不是眞實有存在的人兒。他一生所得到的女人，雖然是不可勝計，但都祇是一班的普通人。固然她們都具有沈魚落雁之容，閉月羞花之貌，但是仍然和他所理想的差得太遠了。</p>
<p>唐璜是貌美。外面可看見的是英俊豐姿，心裏所藴着的是豐富熱情。女人們遇見了他，就會向他追求，而不肯離開他。爲了這個原故，他就不得不四方流浪了！他這麽一來，就給人家說是「狂蜂浪蝶」了！可憐的唐璜！他費了一生的精力，始終都找不着他所愛慕的女人，我們怎能說他是犯了色情狂呢？他爲了要避免許多女人，才四方逃避，我們又怎能說他是狂蜂浪蝶？造成他一生的缺點就是因爲他太愛惜女人了，他不忍使她們愛到失望的痛苦，所以就承受了「不忠實」的批評。世人們又怎了解到他内在的隠痛？</p>
<p>雖然在我們看來，他所追求的女人是太理想化了。但是然唐璜在西衛爾的時候，生活的組織，並不像現在我們這麽機械化。他所生活的地方在詩般的環境裏和浪漫的情緒中。所以他對於理想實現的希望是太重了。我們實在不能怪他。</p>
<p>英國大詩人拜倫也曾爲唐璜的一生寫了不少的記述，但所寫的事跡，並不見得都是眞正的事實。我們如果要眞正的認識唐璜，就不得不實地去搜集一切關於他的傳記以及一切的遺事，把他分析出來，才可以明　唐璜的眞面目。人的一生當然是有長有短有善有惡，但是作書的往往喜歡吹毛求疵地把他的短處寫出，把他的惡行擴大。他本來所有的眞面目反而一筆抹煞了。</p>
<p>總之我們要明白唐璜的一生是想從浪漫的過程中，尋求到他理想中十全十美，毫無缺陷的美人，但是他終於失望了。</p>

<h3 id="c346">評「憐香惜玉」 <a href="#c346" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e346" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">346</a></h3>
<p>— 華綸</p>
<p>One　Exciting</p>
<p>Adventure—大上海</p>
<p>屈就了郎德川奏技的伴演品的這一「憐香惜玉」，在許多不够高明的偵探片中，倒並不因牠的短而减少牠之缺點的。</p>
<p>牠虚搆了一羣莫明其妙的人物。少女莉娜以絶世的嬌艶天人，而到處行竊，說是由於神經衰弱症的嬉戲態度。靑年萊佛沙却坐了汽車跟着她跑。到處給她付償失主的損失，說是因爲愛她。在這近於神秘，怪誕的設置下，劇情展了開來。偵探福斯理由她在一次行竊中做關子的手套的芬芳上，拉出了香水商華爾德，華一見傾心地愛上了她，和萊佛沙三人大閙其愛的糾紛，加上那個壽頭壽腦的神斯理的噱頭。結果在案卷中間發覺萊佛沙原來是著名的大騙子。於是出了錢給兩個辦事探案的人，算她舞罪。同時莉娜改去宿疾，和香水商結婚。</p>
<p>從牠的演出方面來說，自然，在如此這般的劇本中，要求什麽特别的成績是不會有的。和没落期許多平凡的偵探片一樣，演出上儘量避免着一些枯燥的探索與嚴肅的偵察，而以戀愛，歌舞來交織案子的進行。甚至把辦案的偵探等人物，也丑角化，噱頭化了以增加輕鬆與趣味的空氣。這是一般製作者藏拙之道，也正是技窮的必然表現。</p>
<p>導演E·Franke在這兒並不見過人的地方，只是寫女主角莉娜那種神秘，飄忽的地方，儘量用氛圍來烘托性格這點上較成功。</p>
<p>Binnje　Barnes的莉娜，在冷靜時不够神秘與潇洒。在熱情時也不够奔放與沸躍。演華爾德與萊佛沙兩人，更是平平而已。倒是飾福斯理的GrantMitchell把社會上的某一種人，刻劃得頗能入木三分。</p>
<h3 id="c347">評「羅敷艶史」 <a href="#c347" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e347" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">347</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Elinor　Norton—國泰</p>
<p>少女愛麗娜抛棄了愛着她的華利，而遵從祖母的意見去嫁了唐納。丈夫的生性好妒，使她非常的感着婚姻上的痛苦。唐納從軍出征後，她愛上了另一少年林茵。可是，她事不常，唐納回來了，除了本性的好妒脾氣外，戰爭又把他造成了一個神經病的患者。愛麗娜從此在憐惜丈夫與戀愛情人中，成爲愛與妒交攻下的俘虜。幾經波折與糾紛，結果達到了愛之結合的歸宿。</p>
<p>原著者Mfary　Roberts　Reinhart這一作品已經是庸俗淺薄的了。Rose　Franken更未能電影藝術的地來處理牠，只是依據着原作搆成了一部冗長，散漫的影片。承受着好妒的丈夫會願竟和妻子的情人提出合夥經營牧塲的要求，與對情敵商訂六個月愛的試騐期等笑話外，更强調地發揮了丈夫堕馬荒郊，情人汽車趕到救護這一巧合，來作着全劇的重要關鍵。於柔和的劇調中，插着幾段不必要的戰爭塲面。這也許是故意安排了來增加劇的力量，與襯托愛麗娜與情人馳馬的戲吧，可是突然與生硬，足以破壞全劇的情緒，這是顯然的缺點。</p>
<p>導演Hamilton　Mac　Fadden算是努力地獲得了一些成績的。除了受着編劇方面的限制外，個别的若干塲面，是頗見功夫與聰敏的。如妒性未發作前，那股新婚夫婦的愛勁，寫得極神秘潔凈。發生勃谿後，妻的心理的苦痛與對丈夫的表白，以及雪中的情景，都精細地把劇中人的心境，寄托在四週的事物上去，乃是可取的。高潮的設置與處理，也較適合與充份，獲得效果不少。頂點的突變後，來一段清新的結束。同樣是寄心情於景物，昭示着另一境地的開展。只是戰爭中的描寫，有偷工减料之嫌，不是嗎？旣是兇惡的一戰，傷亡决不會如畫面上那樣的，只唐納等一二人的。</p>
<p>演員中，以（laire　Trevor的愛麗娜較好。愛與憐的矛盾心理演來頗爲動人，比之在「小娃娃」中是進步了的。飾林茵的原是容易成功的角色，可是Gilber　Roland没有做到應有的成績。Hugh　Williams好像是很會做戲的，但在這兒却未能把愛妻子，妒情仇的性情表現得够。在神經病患者的可以發揮下，也只是平平地過去而已。</p>

<p>記憶好的電影觀衆，一定還能够記着這位在默片時代享着盛名的玻拉納格里吧—從銀幕上銷聲匿跡了三年左右的她，現在又回到好萊塢重作馮婦了。</p>
<p>她的第一部影片聽說將根據十九世紀波蘭聞名的作曲家弗特立卓賓（Frederic　Chopin）、的一生爲題材云。華納公司目下正和她談判着各種條件，因爲玻拉非常喜歡那故事，所以大槪不至於發生什麽問題的。</p>
<p>可是事實上，波拉對於重登銀壇的事情，好像不大注意着似的，她目今專門致力的是，怎樣去佈置新近買下的范倫鐵諾的房屋。</p>
<p>「我已經决定把我的餘生在這裏過去，」玻拉這樣對新聞記者說，「並且只有在這房子裏，我才能够快樂地過日子—時常能够回味當時我和范倫鐵諾的甜蜜的愛。我想他亦一定喜歡我這樣住在這裏的吧！」</p>

<p>— 素因</p>
<p>迭倫又哎唷了幾聲，呻吟着道：「因爲我…喔…吃了太苦了…燒壞了…並且…倒霉的事，接一連二的來到我身上，頭一次，車子掉在溝裏。後來天又下雨，淋得我浸濕。後來又燒了一下子。現在我又傷了風了。這一天吓…這一晚吓…」傑弗雷怪模怪樣地看着他，然後假意的問道：「曼麗呢？她怎麽樣了？」迭倫撅着一張嘴道：「曼麗！還問她作什麽。我想她很舒服在那兒。她擲開我就走了。她亦没有被燒…她連風都没有傷。恐怕昨天晚上，睡得一生一世没有那麽舒服過呢…我亦不知道她是睡在那兒的」</p>
<p>傑弗雷聽着，起初不敢相信他自已的耳朶。過了一回，她忽然仰天大笑起來。他笑了又笑，笑得不可遏止起來。迭倫問道：「什麽事？這樣高興？」傑弗雷搖着頭道：「你不會知道的。起來吧，喀生諾伐。」他於是將迭倫扶了起來，帮助着他穿好了衣服，預備回家去。</p>
<p>他們在歸途之中，本來可以安然無事的。但是他們在半道，又遇見了康妮。康妮是和莊生一同來尋找她的丈夫的。可是在路上，車胎爆裂了。康妮下了汽車，在路上來往地走着發火，莊生爬在地下整理車胎。傑弗雷的汽車來到這個地方，連忙將車閘住了。康妮惡狠狠地看了迭倫一眼。這時迭倫正坐在前面汽車夫旁邊，一路說不出來的痛苦。他眼大無神地望着康妮帶着哀求的神氣說道：「康妮…有話慢慢說…」康妮聽了，暴躁如雷地嚷道：「我？慢慢說？你這渾蛋！你看你們，多好的一個家庭大團圓呀！」他嚷着吵着，連坐在後面的葆拉，曼麗和傑弗雷，都給她駡在一起了。「到底這是怎麽一回事呀？你說給我聽聽。可是你不說，我亦猜不出來的嗎？」</p>
<p>傑弗雷，當然又祇有他來出頭。他很客氣的對着康妮說道：「杜達夫人現在路上不好說話。你要是肯坐上我們的車子，我們到了城裏，自然有辦法想出來的。」康妮很不願意似的，祇得聽了他的話，坐上了他們的汽車，傑弗雷一路上就和康妮開始談判起來。曼麗還時時對着傑弗雷，不斷地熱嘲冷駡。可是傑弗雷不理她。他不久就和康她談判好了。叫迭倫給她一百萬元的赡養費，他們就此離婚。迭倫在前面聽着，亦無可如何，祇好含胡答應了。曼麗當然亦無話可說。</p>
<p>他們不久已經來到迭倫寓所的門前。一切問題都已解决了。迭倫祇好進去，拿了他自已的東西搬到俱樂部裏，或是到醫院裏去養傷。康妮呢？亦定了明天到墨西哥去立理離婚手續。傑弗雷將迭倫扶下了汽車，扶上了台階，走了進去，直扶到電梯裏。但是等到他退了出來，走到大門外面的時候，曼麗和葆拉，已經坐着原車開走了，已經開出了一箭之路，追不上了。</p>
<p>傑弗雷不覺暗暗駡了一聲，連忙喚了一輛街車追趕上去。等到他追上曼麗，曼麗已經要進她的屋子了。傑弗雷跳下了汽車，搶上一步，拉住了曼麗的臂膊道：「曼麗…你和我生氣嗎？」曼麗掙扎着，想推開他的手，但是掙扎不脫。她喊道：「放手…我的臂膊痛了…」傑弗雷央求道：「那是不得已的。康妮是準備着將這事閙大的。我没有法子，祇可以先穏住她…讓她以爲你情願嫁給迭倫的。」曼麗突然回過頭來，對着他道：「讓她以爲我情願嫁給迭倫？我準定要嫁給他了。你覺得怎樣？」（未完）</p>

<p>Changliang and Wumin Rivers Are Our Territory</p>
<p>And Only Local Militias Maintain Order</p>
<p>Japanese Army Claims It Belongs to Fengning</p>
<p>And Deploys Land and Air Forces in an Attempt to Occupy It</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, there have been reports that Japanese and puppet troops in Rehe are active in the Changliang and Wumin River areas under the jurisdiction of Guyuan County, Chahar Province. A reporter made a special trip to interview a member of the Chahar Provincial Government to inquire about the truth. According to the official, the Japanese and puppet troops will be moving towards the Changliang and Wumin River area, which is completely unexpected. Upon investigation, the areas of Changliang, Wumin River, North Shizhuzi, South Shizhuzi, and Yong'an Fort originally belong to Guyuan County, Chahar Province. The boundaries are clearly marked on maps both domestically and internationally. Moreover, there are no stationed troops in the above areas, only local militias maintaining order. At a time when Sino-Japanese relations are improving, the Japanese troops stationed in Rehe claim that the above areas are under the jurisdiction of Fengning County, Rehe Province, and will take military action, which is regrettable. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that the main force of the Japanese army in Chengde is now assembled in Fengning County, Rehe. The frontline troops are stationed in the Datian area, with approximately 3,000 puppet troops under Zhang HaiPeng, and a thousand Japanese troops as their rearguard. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan hosted a banquet for Takahashi, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, tonight. He may return to Chahar in the next day or two. There have been some recent movements of Japanese and puppet troops in eastern Chahar. The puppet troops under Zhang HaiPeng, currently stationed in the Datian area, number approximately 2,000, with about 1,000 Japanese troops. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) According to reports, the Kwantung Army believes that the areas where Chinese troops are stationed from Dushikou to Guyuan belong to Fengning County, Rehe. Lieutenant Colonel Takahashi, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, issued a warning to Song Zheyuan, who was passing through Beiping in a certain direction last night, demanding the immediate withdrawal of the troops stationed in eastern Chahar, or they will take decisive action. (Hualian News Agency Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) According to today's news, two units of the Japanese army have advanced to Dagge Town and Datian. The main force in Datian has advanced towards Guyuan, and a unit in Dagge Town has also advanced towards Dushikou, both sending out pickets and advancing slowly. Japanese reconnaissance planes are flying frequently over the provincial border. Their base has shifted westward from Chengde. (Hualian News Agency Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) All sectors of the Chinese community here are silent about the Chahar incident. No newspapers have published news about this issue. The Dagong Bao published an editorial today discussing Huang Fu's departure from Beiping, viewing the overall situation as very serious. They hope that the Chinese authorities will negotiate with the Japanese side immediately and not delay. Military authorities here claim that the overall situation has not yet developed. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This afternoon, the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Changchun issued a statement saying that they have now assembled Japanese military aircraft to immediately repel Song Zheyuan and his cavalry, who entered the Datang area near Guyuan, Rehe Province, last year and disrupted local administration. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Immediately after the Kwantung Army issued its statement, it began military action. (Japan United Press Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) According to reports, the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Changchun issued a statement at 8:00 PM last night, saying that the Kwantung Army will soon use the main force of the Japanese army stationed in Rehe and a portion of the army and air force to attack Song Zheyuan's troops in Fengning County.

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese are consolidating their control over veterans in various parts of North China, including their administration and training. The military headquarters has ordered veterans in Jinan, Qingdao, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, and other areas in eastern Luan to organize branches and be under the command of Meijiro Umezu, the commander of the Japanese garrison in North China. The veteran associations are striving to become stronger. On the 18th, Umezu also dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Kawaguchi, a staff officer, to various places to convey his intentions and inspect the organizational content of the branches.

<h3 id="e22">The Problem of Foreign Rice in the People's Food Supply, by Liu <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The food supply issue in our country remains an enigma to this day. Whether there is a surplus or deficit, or whether we can barely manage self-sufficiency, no one can say for sure. Judging from the grain imports over the years, it is undoubtedly insufficient. However, after the autumn harvest of the 22nd year, before the drought of the 23rd year, the rice-producing provinces were deeply troubled by the low grain prices that harmed farmers. As the drought gradually worsened and rice exports were banned, everyone was alarmed by the potential shortage. It is truly a case of "how quickly things change," with such contradictions, which is genuinely incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Since the emergence of the disaster, rice prices in Shanghai have been rising daily. The reason for this price increase is largely due to panic. Fearing a food shortage, people rushed to order foreign rice to make up for the deficit. Recently, it has been reported that registered foreign rice has reached 4.6 million bags. Some believe that Zhejiang will experience the most severe rice shortage this year, estimated at about 10 million bags. Jiangsu is expected to be short about 2 million bags, and Jiangxi about 1 million bags, totaling 13 million bags. On the production side, Jiangbei is expected to produce about 2 million bags, Anhui about 2 million bags, Hunan 1.5 million bags, the Yisha area of Hubei 500,000 bags, and Quanzhou and Zhangzhou in Fujian also 500,000 bags, with the Wenzhou area of Zhejiang producing about 500,000 bags, totaling 7 million bags. Comparing supply and demand, there is a shortfall of 6 million bags. After deducting the already registered 4.6 million bags, the shortage is only a little over 1 million bags. Moreover, there is still unregistered foreign rice. Taking everything into account, the shortage is minimal. It seems that there will be no food problem during the lean season. This optimistic view is in stark contrast to the fear of starvation and high prices not long ago. Based on this, who knows if in a few months, the same old excuses of insufficient grain, poor spring harvest, renewed insect plagues, and unfavorable rice cultivation will not be used to justify another surge in grain prices?</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices have experienced a slight dip. The reasons are nothing more than: (1) The foreign rice orders are due to arrive successively before the Lunar New Year; (2) Rice arrivals from the north of the river are abundant because the domestic silver market is tight, and everyone wants to sell rice to prepare for the year-end accounting period;</p>
<p>(3) The Shanghai silver market appears loose but is secretly tight. One party is eager to sell, while the other has no intention of storing much, so rice prices are sluggish. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon. What will happen to rice prices after the stock market reopens is impossible to predict in advance. In our opinion, the following points should be considered at present:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai rice is shipped to various ports in the north and south, with Zhejiang accounting for the majority. Zhejiang itself lacks rice, and the shortage is even greater after the severe drought. According to records, in the 18th year of the Republic, Su and Zhejiang suffered from insect plagues. In the 19th year, Shanghai imported 7,138,406 dan of foreign rice. This year, if we calculate based on 4.6 million bags (each bag weighing 200 pounds), it is equivalent to 6.9 million dan, which is not much different from the total import volume of the 19th year. If we continue to order, it will inevitably exceed the highest amount of the 19th year. However, a look at the economic situation of farmers in western Zhejiang shows that they are even worse off than in the 19th year. The failure of silk cocoons and the low prices of agricultural products were followed by a rare drought. The farmers' homes are empty, and their faces are pale. This is a true picture of the farmers in western Zhejiang today. Therefore, western Zhejiang certainly lacks food and needs rice, but it has no purchasing power. Although Shanghai has a lot of rice, western Zhejiang is still likely to have many starving people. Whether these 4.6 million bags of foreign rice can be sold as smoothly as in the 19th year is still questionable. If foreign rice is in surplus, the inevitable phenomena will be: first, rice prices will fall, which will affect the market for domestic rice; second, the rice merchants who suffered losses from ordering rice in the 21st year of the Republic have not recovered their vitality and can hardly bear another loss. If this affects the commerce of Jinbu and the financial industry that provides guarantees, then the impact will not be limited to the rice industry itself. Therefore, there should be appropriate restrictions on future foreign rice orders.</p>
<p>(2) I have always said that there is no solution to the trade problem, and there is no solution to the silver problem. Mr. G.E. Anderson once said that to solve the problem of trade deficit, simply stop importing grain, which would be enough to offset it. (The original text can be found in the 95th issue of the Economic Journal.) Since last year, there has been a large outflow of silver. Some of it is indeed for transportation and profit, but most of it is to pay for goods. Now is not the time to save on foreign goods and promote domestic goods to solve the current difficulties. If there are still large payments for food, will it not increase the rate of silver outflow? Taking the ordered foreign rice as an example, the price (excluding tax) is estimated at 10 yuan per bag, which is already 46 million yuan. If the order amount is increased, the amount paid will also increase. Therefore, from a trade perspective, there is a need for careful consideration regarding continued orders for foreign rice. However, this is not for the benefit of those who have already ordered foreign rice. With the unusually warm winter this year, vegetables and beans are in bloom, and wheat seedlings are growing vigorously. In the last three days, the weather has been cold and freezing. The early-growing beans and wheat cannot withstand the destruction of the cold and will inevitably freeze to death. The spring harvest will be disappointing, and the disaster victims will suffer another blow. Thinking of this, the future food supply problem is a matter of great urgency. The central government should establish a policy under the dual consideration of national economy and people's livelihood and make preparations early. Whether or not to continue ordering foreign rice will not be difficult to resolve accordingly. If you want to use local forces to deal with unregistered foreign rice, there will inevitably be many entanglements. Does not the delay in the Vietnam trade agreement arise from the issue of taxing foreign rice? We should seriously consider this issue with utmost caution.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Affairs Advisory Council, an advisory body to the Foreign Minister preparing for extraordinary diplomacy, held its first meeting at the Foreign Minister's residence at 11:00 AM today. Attendees included Foreign Minister Hirota, Vice Minister Shigemitsu, heads of various departments, former ambassador to Germany Nagai, former ambassador to the United States Debuchi, former ambassador to France Nagaoka, ambassador to Russia Ota, former ambassador to France Matsushima, former ambassador to Brazil Hayashi, former envoy to Portugal Kasama, and former envoy to Greece Kawashima, among other veterans of the diplomatic world. Foreign Minister Hirota explained the reason for establishing the council and expressed his hope for cooperation. He then explained the disarmament issue, the transfer negotiations of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the diplomatic progress with Manchuria, the United States, and China. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM. Matters for consultation will be submitted at the next meeting, and the council is expected to be a valuable diplomatic advisory body. (Dentsu, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e25">British Newspaper Reveals Conspiracy <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Labour Party newspaper "Daily Herald" published a commentary stating that the Japanese Ambassador to China, Arima, will go to Nanjing in the coming days to seek the restoration of friendly relations between China and Japan. This move is of particular importance because Japan is now preparing a new action to implement its grand plan to dominate the Far East. This is very obvious. Every time Japan engages in military aggression on the Manchurian border, it simultaneously sends a very friendly impression to Nanjing, hoping to negotiate everything with Nanjing. This has been the case in the past, and it is the same now. Japan is now inviting China not to regard Japan as an enemy, but to see it as protecting China from the invasion of the "White Peril." Moreover, since China and Japan are of the same culture and race, they should cooperate closely. While Japan is showering honeyed words, it is also displaying poison gas, tanks, and aircraft in Chahar to warn China of the dangers that may arise from disregarding Japan's wishes. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>Franco-Polish Talks Far from Understanding</p>
<p>Solidarity of the Little Entente Strengthened</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the settlement of the Saar issue, the hopes that have arisen from all sides were freely expressed yesterday when representatives of various countries exchanged views at the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations. During these various private talks, the issue of Germany's return to Geneva was also mentioned by representatives of various countries. In addition, the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact proposed by France has once again become the focus of discussion. French Foreign Minister Laval held lengthy discussions with representatives of the Soviet Union and the Balkan Entente last night. The governments of the Balkan Entente countries have already expressed their disapproval of this issue. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>A military newspaper in Warsaw expressed optimism about the talks between French Foreign Minister Laval and Polish Foreign Minister Beck in Geneva, saying that the talks between the two foreign ministers have been able to eliminate the differences between the two countries. Although the practical result of the talks between the two foreign ministers can only increase France's understanding of Polish principles, Poland views its policy as having won. The talks between the two are related to the Rome Accords and the Eastern European Locarno Pact. In other words, the political foundation for resolving the Eastern European issue must take into account Poland's interests. Polish Foreign Minister has repeatedly stated this solemnly, so this point must be included in any discussion of the Eastern European issue. If this can be achieved, Poland will take a positive attitude towards various agreements. (National News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>A semi-official Polish newspaper in Warsaw today prominently published a Geneva dispatch, saying that it has learned from well-informed sources that the Eastern European Pact issue was not mentioned in the Geneva negotiations, and headlined it "Stalemate of the Eastern European Pact." Although the telegram is very vague, political circles in Warsaw believe that this is the result of talks between Laval and Beck. If so, the French newspaper's Geneva dispatch, which stated that Poland has not changed its refusal to join the Eastern European Locarno Pact after negotiating with French Foreign Minister Laval, seems to have been confirmed. (National News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Telegraph, after French Foreign Minister Laval discussed with the Little Entente countries, the Balkan countries, and representatives of the Soviet Union, many difficulties have been found in the Rome Accords regarding the non-interference pact in the Danube region. The countries contacted by the French Foreign Minister have not yet agreed, as the foreign ministers of the three Little Entente countries have already issued a protocol stipulating that the Little Entente countries or the Balkan countries will not participate in the Danube Pact unless Laval can conclude a cooperation treaty with the Soviet Union when Germany or Poland refuses to sign the Eastern European Pact. The Little Entente and the Balkan countries also reserve the right to decide how to participate in the Danube Pact, and it is heard that Litvinov also holds the same attitude. All countries must give Laval a firm guarantee before Prime Minister Flandin goes to London. This proves the unity between the Soviet Union, the Little Entente, and the Balkan countries, so Laval must make a decision in Geneva. (National News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives of the four Balkan Entente countries (namely Greece, Turkey, Romania, and Yugoslavia) recently held a meeting here, chaired by Greek Foreign Minister Maximos. No communique was issued after the meeting, but the meeting recognized the benefits of expanding the Rome Accords and advocated the establishment of broad understanding, which would not harm the proposal of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. The Balkan Entente meeting was very satisfied with the speech of French Foreign Minister Laval at the Council of the League of Nations yesterday. (Havas, 18th)</p>

The Council of the League of Nations is requested to pay greater attention to the records regarding this matter in Japan's next report. It is heard that Japan is building a new wharf on Saipan Island, costing 150,000 Japanese yen; building a mooring place in the port of Palau Island, costing 215,000 Japanese yen; and a mooring place on Rota Island, costing 115,000 Japanese yen.

<p>(London) The current session of the Council of the League of Nations is coming to an end. If no unexpected events occur, Lord Privy Seal Eden can return to London from Geneva on the afternoon of tomorrow. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) In September of last year, Polish Foreign Minister Beck notified the General Assembly of the League of Nations that Poland would no longer cooperate with the committee appointed by the League of Nations to implement the guarantee of protecting ethnic minorities within Poland. Poland has long believed that the provisions on ethnic minorities in the Treaty of Versailles should be universally implemented and should not be applied exclusively to Poland and other countries, and cited the fact that Russia and Germany are not bound by this clause as unfair. At the time, European political circles were quite surprised. Subsequently, Poland made various arguments regarding the issue of ethnic minorities within Poland, but the reasons given were very weak. Poland apparently remains firm in its determination. When the Council of the League of Nations discussed this issue today, the Polish representative rose and left the room, only to return to his seat when the next issue on the agenda was discussed. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The dispute between Italy and Abyssinia will be negotiated directly by the respective countries in the hope of reaching a friendly solution. This was determined after French Foreign Minister Laval, British Lord Privy Seal Eden, and Italian representative Aloisi consulted last night. There is no need for the current session of the Council of the League of Nations to discuss it. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) An agreement in principle has been reached on the Somali border dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. The terms stipulate that the status quo remains unchanged. It is expected that the Council of the League of Nations will pass a resolution today to leave the issue for consideration during the next session. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Difficulties are currently being encountered here regarding the dispute between Persia and Iraq over demarcation of the border.

<p>(Geneva) Italian representative to the Council of the League of Nations Aloisi and Saar Governing Commission Chairman Knox both denied this afternoon that the withdrawal of the Saar International Police Force had been decided. The date of withdrawal has not yet been specified, but it is not without the possibility of starting the withdrawal within a month. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The international police force stationed in the Saar region to maintain security during the vote will be withdrawn next month. According to today's resolution of the Council of the League of Nations, the international police force will begin to withdraw on the first of next month, with Italian troops being the first to return. The issue of Saar refugees has been included on the agenda of the current session of the Council at the proposal of the French representative. According to Paul Rohrbach, a Saar leader who opposes the National Socialist Party, it is estimated that 20,000 refugees will leave the country. The French government submitted a memorandum on the issue of Saar refugees to the League of Nations today, stating that the League of Nations has a moral responsibility to guarantee the safety of the people it has governed for fifteen years. The League of Nations should be responsible for the resettlement expenses of Saar refugees. It also requested that this issue be included on the agenda of a future meeting of the Council of the League of Nations. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Laval recently submitted a memorandum from the French government to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, requesting that the Saar refugee issue be included on the agenda of the current session of the Council, because if the cooperation of the League of Nations cannot be obtained, France will not be able to implement an open-door policy for Saar political refugees.

<p>Specifying Method for Coal Mine Redemption Payment</p>
<p>(Geneva) An agreement was reached between France and Germany yesterday on the issue of the aftermath of the Saar region, as reported in the previous telegram. After official publication, there are the following supplementary items. According to the agreement on the Saar issue concluded between France and Germany in Rome on December 3 of last year, the Council of the League of Nations registered it. This agreement has determined the most important principles, which stipulate that Germany should pay 900 million francs as a redemption payment for French state-owned coal mines. The payment method was specified yesterday. Germany will first pay France in francs circulating in the Saar region, and then remit in marks. Any shortfall will be paid annually at the price of coal produced in the Saar region, in installments over five years. In addition, after Germany recovers the businesses invested and operated by French private individuals in the Saar region, Germany recognizes its obligation to repay the capital invested by French private individuals, but the method of repayment is limited to when Germany has a trade surplus with France. Therefore, France and Germany must conduct more complete commercial negotiations. After joint decision by the two countries, all French economic relations will be negotiated directly by the two countries without the need for the League of Nations to manage them. The League of Nations will only handle the clearing of all past pending cases and the establishment of new systems. The German and French governments also pre-recognize that the resolutions of the Council of the League of Nations are of a mandatory nature and must be implemented. Finally, regarding the disarmament of the Saar region, Germany recognizes that the clauses on disarmament in the Treaty of Versailles apply to all other Rhineland regions, including the Saar region.

<p>(Paris) Talks between France and Germany on the aftermath of the Saar plebiscite will begin on the 21st of this month, as noted in yesterday's telegram. The French delegation responsible for these talks will be led by Pomaret-Foucault, Director of Commercial Treaties of the Ministry of Commerce, and will depart from here tonight for Berlin. The aftermath issues are numerous and complex, and it is feared that negotiations will not be completed before the deadline of February 15 set by the Council of the League of Nations. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Diplomatic Political News reported that there should be no problems that cannot be easily resolved regarding the issues related to the return of the Saar. The clear resolution of the Council of the League of Nations yesterday has dispelled all doubts. If France and Germany can still approach future issues in the spirit of negotiation of the Saar Committee chaired by Aloisi, Germany does not share the view that future issues are complex and difficult, as stated by the French Foreign Minister. The newspaper expressed respect for Laval's fair attitude in Geneva yesterday in respecting the treaty and acknowledging the residents of the Saar's strict adherence to order, and said that Laval's remarks are completely consistent with Hitler's statement that there are no territorial disputes between the two countries, so it is enough to be a wake-up call to those who mistakenly believe that political conspiracies can still achieve their goals.

It is learned that the French interior has issued this in order to ease the public sentiment in France, because the separatist factions in the Saar region, as reported in various newspapers, intend to use Paris as a base to carry out propaganda, which has caused considerable unease among the people.

The report said that although the commission had withdrawn from the disputed site, Italian military aircraft soared alone over the commission's tents, which were flying the British flag, and prepared to open machine guns on them. The British representative worked hard to get a fair resolution to the border dispute, but the Italian commander repeatedly obstructed it and threatened that if the commission did not comply with his request, he would mobilize hundreds of troops. Italian commander in Ualual, Cinno Meiru, today denied that he had prepared to open machine guns on the commission's tents. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>After the Dutch East Indies government in Batavia declared its free trade policy on November 1 of last year, it formulated an import restriction order for fifty-six kinds of goods and an import permit system. At that time, as a result of Japan's serious protest, implementation was temporarily suspended. Now, the Dutch East Indies government still intends to announce this restriction order, planning to take the opportunity of the adjournment of Dutch-Japanese talks to announce and implement it. The contents of the new restriction order are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The goods subject to the new restriction order reach more than sixty kinds, but due to administrative procedures, orders are issued in several batches, each time specifying five or six kinds. The first items to be restricted are glassware, porcelain, bicycles, and other items. It will take at least half a year to implement the restrictions on all sixty-plus kinds of goods. (2) The new restriction order does not apply to the quota system of various countries, with a few exceptions. Furthermore, the import quantity is based on the quantity needed domestically. (3) Restrictions on Japanese goods are based on the import situation in 1933, with 25% being the maximum limit. (18th Japan Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) Colonel Lindbergh, a famous aviator, is currently in Miami City. According to his friend, once the trial of his young son's kidnapping case is over, Lindbergh will fly a "Clipper" aircraft to cross the Pacific Ocean, in order to establish a foundation for the Pacific air route. This Pacific air route is jointly operated by Watson Company and Pan American Railway Company, and is managed by Yang Ge, the former Director of the Aviation Department of the State Department. It is expected to open in April of this year, with the starting point being either Los Angeles or San Francisco, passing through the Hawaiian Islands, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, or Yap Island, and Manila, stopping at various locations, and finally reaching Guangzhou. Among them, the section from the United States to Hawaii is the longest, reaching 3,860 kilometers. The American female aviator Earhart recently flew this section in eighteen hours. If a "Clipper" aircraft is used, it will only take twelve hours. The entire journey from the United States to Guangzhou is 14,480 kilometers. Ordinary mail ships take four weeks, but after the Pacific air mail route is opened, it will only take sixty hours to arrive. (18th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Seventeen Trunk and Branch Lines in Total</p>
<p>Used for Mail Delivery in Peacetime and Military Purposes in Wartime</p>
<p>According to information received by the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Shenyang from the China United Press, due to the slightly improved negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Russian-Japanese relations seem to have greatly eased. However, Soviet Russia's military preparations against Japan are becoming increasingly consolidated. Along the border line centered on Suifenhe, Hailar, and Manzhouli, Soviet Russia has deployed a large military force, and military supplies are being continuously transported by railways in the Far East. These land-based military preparations are being systematically prepared in conjunction with the Second Five-Year Plan. In particular, the expansion of the air force has been secretly carried out since 1932. Now, it has completed its aviation spider web in various parts of the Far East, that is, the trunk line connecting Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, and Moscow, with more than ten branch lines set up in the east, west, north, and south. Currently, these lines are used exclusively for mail transportation, but once war breaks out, they will immediately become military lines. It is found that the branch lines include the Aleksandrovsk and Yanuzhno lines centered on Vladivostok, the Hailar, Piyon, Komsomolsk, Okha, and Aleksandrovsk lines centered on Khabarovsk, the Pokzhi Gari Ao and Pok Yaer Ge Ao lines centered on Hailar, and the Tigas Dehli, Kerbin, and Geer Jiang lines centered on Nikolaevsk, totaling fifteen lines including other short lines. The flight status of these lines is extremely smooth, completely surrounding the northern sky of the Far East. In particular, the two branch lines centered on Hailar and Boli have very large transportation capacity. The North Sakhalin line between Okha and Aleksandrovsk also flies once a day or every two days, and this line and the Vladivostok line, together with the various lines gathered in the Primorsky Krai, constitute an encirclement line of the Japanese mainland, confronting the Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Chita, and Moscow lines, completely surrounding Japan and the Eastern Provinces.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Investigation of Kala-azar in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Widespread Disease Area; Patients Totaling 100,000</p>
<p>Research Team Establishes Office, Provides Daily Treatment</p>
<p>Qingjiangpu Correspondence: Kala-azar is spreading in northern Jiangsu, with a very large number of sufferers. The most severely affected areas are east of Xuzhou, including Suqian, Huaiyin, and Lianshui. The Health Experiment Office of the National Economic Council organized a Kala-azar research team last year to conduct on-site investigations and establish an office to begin treatment. Recently, Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government has also paid extraordinary attention to this disease, sending personnel to Jiangbei to investigate and research in order to find ways to treat it, which is truly good news for those suffering from this disease. The distribution of Kala-azar in northern Jiangsu, the analysis of patients, the current status of diagnosis and treatment, and the details of the disease are described in detail below for the reference of those who are concerned about this disease. (1) Distribution of the Disease Area: Kala-azar, the English name for Kala-azar, is commonly known as 症塊病 ["Zheng Kuai Bing", roughly "lump disease"]. In the past, this disease was prevalent in the Mediterranean and India, and patients were all black-skinned and feverish, hence the name Kala-azar. This disease is rare in China. The black fever phenomenon that attracts attention is that the patient's spleen and liver harden into lumps, and the lump refers to the spleen lump. Kala-azar has only entered China for less than twenty years. At that time, a British soldier who had been stationed in India died in Beiping, and after autopsy and research by Xiehe Hospital, it was discovered to be Kala-azar. This was the first patient in China. From then on, it moved south and spread to Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces. Although Beiping is the origin of Kala-azar in China, there are not many patients. Xiehe Hospital treats only forty or fifty Kala-azar patients each year. The most severely affected areas are along the old Yellow River channel. The number of Kala-azar patients diagnosed and treated by Qingjiangpu Renci Hospital and the church hospitals in Suqian, Xuzhou, and Suining are as follows:</p>
<p>Year 　1931　 1932　 1933</p>
<p>Qingjiangpu 3,383 people 2,904 people 2,200 people</p>
<p>Suqian ———— 350 people 650 people</p>
<p>Xuzhou ———— ———— 700 people</p>
<p>Suining ———— ———— 350 people</p>
<p>In addition, Donghai, Siyang, Huaian, Lianshui, Guanyun, Funing, Shuyang, Pixian, Xiaoxian, Fengxian, 𥓘shan, Peixian, etc., are also areas with a large number of Kala-azar patients. Taking Donghai alone, the number of patients exceeds 1,500. According to statistics, there are nearly 100,000 Kala-azar patients in northern Jiangsu. Qingjiangpu Renci Hospital treated a total of 2,904 Kala-azar patients in 1932. According to the analysis of the patients' origin, the numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingjiangpu 881 Shuyang 390</p>
<p>Lianshui 1,287 Qiaoning 1</p>
<p>Xuzhou 2 Siyang 228</p>
<p>Suqian 3 Huaian 86</p>
<p>Guanyun 6 Funing 15</p>
<p>Donghai 2 Other 3</p>
<p>(2) Kala-azar Research Team: Kala-azar patients are mostly poor people. If new methods of injection are used, whether Tartanr Emali Neostan or Neostidoean is used, each person must spend at least 15 yuan. Poor patients cannot easily raise this huge amount of money. They often gather into fifteen people, each contributing one yuan to get fifteen yuan. A lottery method is used to decide who will use the money for treatment. Only one person out of fifteen can get the money for treatment, and the other fourteen can only sit and wait for death. Rural sorcerers take the opportunity to deceive people with lies, using sharp iron and porcelain objects to draw lines on the patient's abdomen to draw blood, claiming to treat the disease, but in fact, they are deceiving people for money, charging up to six yuan. The villagers are ignorant, wasting money and delaying treatment, which is the worst thing. In view of this, the Health Experiment Office of the National Economic Council organized a Kala-azar research team to conduct investigations and research in Qingjiangpu, and to provide treatment at the same time. The team is headed by Yao Yongzheng, Director of the Department of Parasitology of the Health Experiment Office, and Pu Nangu, Doctor of Medicine, is the Medical Director. There is also one medical officer, two technicians, one technical student, and two nurses. The Kala-azar Research Team arrived in Qingjiangpu in late April 1934. The office is located in the People's Education Center. They first started the investigation, and then started the treatment on June 31. Outpatient clinics are held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm. On Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, they go out for investigation. Those with severe illness or long distances can stay in the team, and food and drink are also provided by the team without additional charges. In terms of equipment, the Kala-azar Research Team currently has a registration room, an outpatient examination room, a waiting room, an examination room, a waiting room for injections, an injection room, a research examination room, an animal room, a drawing room, and an underground storage room. There are five microscopes, the highest magnification being 1,200 times. There are 430 voles, 15 rabbits, and many white flies. There are many hanging pictures and photographs on the walls. The equipment cost is more than 15,000 yuan, and the monthly use of Nootib'an is about 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Analysis of Kala-azar Patients: The Kala-azar research team has investigated nine villages in Qingjiangpu and one village in Siyang. The investigation items are very detailed, including the number of households, patients, deaths, wells, ponds, pigs and dogs, and other health conditions and living environment, all of which are included in the investigation, and drawings are used to illustrate. The number of households in the ten villages and the percentage of patients are published below. (Liu Village belongs to Siyang, the rest belong to Qingjiangpu)</p>

<h3 id="e115">Spring Famine Feared in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Fields Untilled</p>
<p>Villages Prohibit Rice Exports</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi Province was originally a rice-producing area. Before 1926, the annual rice exports from Jiujiang amounted to several million or even ten million yuan. In 1928, it also reached 8,493,154 customs taels. However, since the spread of the bandit scourge, over sixty of the province's eighty-one counties have been captured or partially captured by bandits. In these six years, the rural economy has been completely destroyed by the bandits. More than half of the rural able-bodied men have been drafted and died. Rice production, which is the center of the economy, has also been largely destroyed. The areas that have been fortunately recovered and are safe also have their production greatly affected due to the guerrilla looting by the Red bandits and the draft for joint suppression. Therefore, from 1930 to 1934, not only were there no rice exports, but Annam Saigon rice needed to be imported continuously to provide disaster relief. Especially in southern Jiangxi, there was an unprecedented rice shortage the year before last, with each dan of rice soaring to over forty yuan in silver dollars. As if misfortunes never come singly, last year there was also an unprecedented drought, with the entire territory suffering. Among them, northern Jiangxi was the worst affected. In the eighty-one counties, the average harvest of the upper and lower years, river villages, and mountain villages was less than 60%. A rice shortage occurred in various places where even the roots of the rice stalks were harvested. Due to the drought, it was difficult for one village to protect another and one township to protect another in the safe areas of the province. As a result, many places independently banned exports, while there was not a single grain left in the bandit areas and newly recovered areas, and people were crying out for food. Moreover, Ruijin, Ningdu, Yudu, Hengfeng, and even various bandit areas not only have no food, but even the seeds have been exhausted, and the fields are all barren, with lush grass up to the knees. Local accumulation societies are recruiting people to cultivate the barren land, but because the able-bodied men are listed as wounded, have fled, or have been coerced away by bandits, no one is interested. The Ningdu Rehabilitation Association has ordered the Baos and Jias to cultivate the barren land on behalf of the owners. Therefore, the food problem in the bandit areas is not just this year's famine problem. According to people who have traveled to the Fuhe and northern Jiangxi areas, the farmers who still have food to eat are estimated to be no more than 30-40%. However, there will be no grain to harvest until July, making this six-month spring famine a great calamity and difficult to overcome. In the past, rice prices in Jiangxi were always one, two, or three yuan lower than in Shanghai and Hankou, but now the price of rice in various places is over twelve yuan per dan, while agricultural products and their by-products have plummeted in value, and no one is interested in them. Therefore, the countryside can only accelerate its decline. The Civil Affairs and Finance Departments are investigating the food situation in various places to carry out adjustments to provide relief for the spring famine. The Four Provinces Farmers Bank is also transporting and selling food under the intention of the central government to adjust the food supply, as a drop in the bucket. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e116">Definite Death of Xun Weizhou, Pseudo Army Commander of Anhui Bandits <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Body Exhumed in Jing County</p>
<p>Head Cut Off and Displayed to the Public</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The bandits Luo Binghui and Fang Zhimin joined forces and fled to Anhui, but were fiercely attacked by the National Army and almost completely annihilated. It was found that these two groups were commanded by Xun Weizhou, the former pseudo 7th Army Corps Commander and later pseudo 10th Division Commander. The bandit Xun was only twenty-four years old, short in stature, and brave in combat. Last year, in the battle of Tanjiaqiao on the Yintun Road in southern Taiping, he was fiercely attacked by the Wang Yaowu Brigade of the National Army and almost completely collapsed. The bandit Xun, taking the lead, gave orders to the bandit crowd and was seriously wounded and killed by bullets. At that time, the Wang Brigade was making smooth military progress and advancing to pursue the bandits. Later, the Provincial Government Chairman's Office received information from Hu Yungen, the surrendered pseudo-Hygiene Minister, and Chen Daonan, the Management Squad Leader, stating that the bandit Xun was indeed killed in action in this battle and that they personally supervised the burial in Maolin Village, Jing County. In order to verify the confession, the Administrative Office ordered Zheng's Regiment of the 78th Division and dispatched Deputy Officer Du Jingtang and Wang Brigade Deputy Officer Huang Wenzhi to go with Hu Yungen and Chen Daonan to excavate. They were indeed exhumed in Pantun Tushan, three miles south of Maolin. The upper body was naked, and the lower body was wearing Western-style wool pants, a black-blue hat, and a red cloth five-pointed star hat flower. An examination of the bandit's corpse revealed a bullet hole in the upper part of the right thigh, and there were also scars on the arm. The neck injury was the most severe, presumably the fatal point. Deputy Officer Du and others cut off the bandit Xun's head and brought it back to report. In addition to displaying the bandit's head to the public, Liu Zhenhua also heavily rewarded the troops who fought in Tanjiaqiao to encourage them. (18th)</p>

<p>Jixi Correspondence: The 468th Regiment of the 78th Division of the Army was originally reorganized from the 19th Route Army and won considerable honors during the Shanghai War. In the spring of last year, it was transferred from Fujian to Wu. At that time, eight or nine thousand Red bandits fled to Taihu. The regiment was ordered to go to suppress the bandits and recover Taihu. However, the Red bandits detected that the strength of the Taihu city was weak and fled back with their main force, attempting to retake Taihu. The regiment commander, Fu Zhaoqian, led all his directly subordinate troops to rush to Taihu overnight, and finally resolved the siege of Taihu without a fight. On November 15, he personally led the 5th Infantry Company and a part of the directly subordinate team to venture into the search and suppression north of Gucheng. Chairman Liu believed that the regiment was brave and good at fighting, and deterred the bandit crowd, so he specially allocated more than 20 platoons to be under the unified command of Regiment Commander Fu. Later, he was ordered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to transfer defense. During the period of suppressing bandits in Anhui, the regiment had excellent military discipline, so when it left Qianshan, the surrounding people gave flags to promote it. When stationed in Tai, in addition to giving flags to reward them, merchants and people also erected monuments to commemorate them. Chairman Liu relied on them very much and frequently issued rewards and punishments, and made various efforts to retain them when ordered to transfer defense. During the ten days when the regiment was stationed in Changhua, in addition to paying attention to building defenses to prevent the bandits from fleeing east, it also revived local officials and people, devoted themselves to the New Life Movement, and promoted local construction, working tirelessly day and night. Therefore, when leaving Changhua, the local people also gave flags to praise them. In total, the regiment received ten flags from various counties. General public opinion said that it was a model army regiment. (19th)</p>

<h3 id="e117">Tax Collection Difficulties, Vegetable Tax Suspended <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Ji Xiaosong and Cheng Ganqing, prominent figures in the Suzhou business community, opposed the vegetable tax levied by tax collector Wei Du, believing it to be an arbitrary levy that caused disturbances. The details of the matter have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that tax collector Wei Du has recently been opposed by Ji and others and publicized in newspapers. Most vegetable vendors have refused to pay the vegetable tax, so tax collection has become difficult. From now on, he can only suspend the collection and report the difficulties to the county government for approval. County Magistrate Wu intends to report the matter to the Finance Department for approval.</p>

<p>Changshu lawyer Xi Dehe, who practices in Suzhou, was arrested in the city and taken to the Public Security Bureau for owing more than three thousand gold in land tax to the Changshu County Government. The Changshu County Government sent police to Suzhou, together with the public security organs, to arrest Xi in front of the temple in the city on the previous day. He was escorted to Changshu County yesterday (19th) to handle the matter.</p>

<p>Liu Hangsu, the second son of the late painter Liu Quran from Dongxiatang in Wuyi City, is wealthy and owns hundreds of acres of fertile land in Xizizhou in the third district. Liu Hangsu recently went to the island to collect rent rice and hired a boatman to accompany him. However, at about 1:00 am on the 17th, while Liu was sleeping soundly in the teahouse, many bandits suddenly broke into the house. Four bandits holding box guns kidnapped Liu. Afterwards, the boatman came to the city to report to his family, but the family had not received a letter from the bandit's den and had no way to rescue him. The police station in charge reported the kidnapping to the Public Security Bureau yesterday (18th) and requested assistance in the arrest.</p>

<p>The new prison in Wuxi, completed at the end of last year, was reported by President Xu and Chief Prosecutor Qian to the Jiangsu Provincial High Court, and then forwarded to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The ministry dispatched technician Zhou Cengzuo to Wuxi yesterday morning to inspect the project. County Magistrate Yan, President Xu, Chief Qian, and Cheng Jingtang, a member of the new prison construction committee, accompanied him on the inspection. Commissioner Zhou expressed great satisfaction. He departed for Suzhou at 3:00 PM to handle official business.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Spring Implementation of Cocoon Exchange Control <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Sericulture Improvement and Management Committee, in order to supervise the collection of improvement fees from various counties and to strictly enforce cocoon exchange control, has established a Wuxi office in this county, appointing Cai Jingde as director. In addition, Zhou Yuanxun, deputy director of the Yixing district, has been transferred to serve as the deputy director of the model district in this county. The committee also sent Secretary Guan Yida to Wuxi from the province the day before yesterday to visit Yan Shenyu, deputy director of the county's model sericulture district, Cai Jingde, Tang Xixiang, director of the Provincial Sericulture Experiment Station, and Ye Shaochun, chairman of the Cocoon Exchange Association, to discuss the implementation of cocoon exchange control. The results were satisfactory to all parties, so the implementation of cocoon exchange control in the spring is inevitable and considerable results are expected. Director Guan has now returned to the province to report.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Reaction to Changes in Business Tax Collection <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The business tax for this spring recently received an order from the Department of Finance to shorten the collection period, setting the collection period for the first month of each quarter and ending it in the second month. Late payments will be subject to late fees, and businesses overdue for more than two months will be required to suspend operations. The county chamber of commerce reported that, according to past practice, the collection period was from the first month of each quarter to the last day of the last month, for a period of three months, which was extremely fair. Given the current drought, the decline of all industries, and the extreme tightness of money, paying taxes on a quarterly basis is already considered compliance with the law. It seems inappropriate to shorten the period to two months and impose penalties for late payment. Therefore, yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Department of Finance requesting approval to withdraw the order and continue to operate in accordance with the old regulations in order to avoid disputes. In addition, the county government issued a notice yesterday stating that rice shops, flower shops, wood shops, bamboo shops, and similar businesses must still pay business tax after paying taxes and obtaining licenses in accordance with the tooth tax regulations and must not avoid or take advantage of loopholes.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Abolition of Farmland Tax Collection Fees <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Dihua, Director of the Department of Finance, recognizing that the accumulated problems in farmland tax collection in various counties in Jiangsu Province are deep and vary, and that a thorough reform is necessary to alleviate the suffering of the people and increase revenue, previously ordered all counties to earnestly rectify the situation. Now, in order to resolve difficulties and actively rectify the situation, it has been decided to abolish the principle of collecting all fees and expenses from the collection fee, starting in the 24th year of the Republic, and to set the following four measures: (1) The collection fee expenditure budget must be prepared and submitted early; (2) The collection fee income over the years should be submitted in detail in a list for review; (3) Collection fee income and expenditure should be included in the general budget; (4) If the collection fee is insufficient in a county, the county's various agencies should hold a meeting to discuss supplementary measures and submit them to the department for approval. Yesterday, County Magistrate Yan of Wuxi was instructed to conduct a detailed study and discussion immediately and to prepare a budget within ten days for approval.</p>

<p>The "Hengyu" ship of the Fu Huai Shipping Bureau's Qingjiang class, which was sailing downstream, was passing through the Qilipu area of Shiying Sishui Town at 8:30 PM on the 17th when six or seven bandits, disguised as passengers, suddenly fired shots into the air with pistols. Two bandit ships were lying in ambush at a nearby port connected to the lake. More than ten bandits jumped onto the ship and searched the purser's office and passengers, causing losses of over 3,000 yuan. While the bandits were searching the ship, the "Datong Huo" ship of the Qing class, which was also sailing downstream, arrived. The bandits fired shots again and boarded the ship to rob it, which lasted for an hour before they roared away into the lake.</p>

<p>Chen Hongzhou's daughter, Zhenbo, a 17-year-old villager from the Rixin River area of the sixth district, was seduced by her neighbor Zhou Muyuan last autumn, resulting in a pregnancy. Zhou, fearing that the girl's father would find out, instigated Zhenbo to have an abortion on the 15th of this month. However, after taking the medicine, she suffered severe abdominal pain and unstoppable bleeding, and died the next day (the 16th). Her father discovered the truth and turned Zhou over to the township office for custody and requested the county government to investigate. After receiving the report, the county government sent Judge Chen to conduct an autopsy yesterday (the 17th) and confirmed the facts. The adulterer Zhou Muyuan was taken to the county and detained after a court hearing.</p>

<p>In Changlai Town, the third district, villager Peng Linfu wanted to borrow 50 yuan from his aunt Peng Shi by mortgaging 1,000 steps of farmland because his 70-year-old grandfather was bedridden and lacked medical funds. They were scheduled to sign the contract the day before yesterday (the 16th). However, when the time came, Peng Shi suddenly reneged, and the two sides began to argue. Linfu, unable to contain his anger, took a kitchen knife and砍 (kan, chop/hack) Peng Shi's head, causing blood to flow like a river and causing her to fall to the ground in pain. Neighbors who heard the commotion turned Linfu over to the district office and sent him to the county government for investigation. Peng Shi was carried to the county yesterday (the 17th). It is said that her injuries were severe and she may die.</p>

<p>The family of Lu Yubo, residing at No. 13 Zhou'anbang, Liuta Township, East Gate of Jiaxing, was visited by three bandits wearing blue short shirts and pants and carrying sharp knives at around 6 PM on January 15th. They kidnapped Yubo's second son, Laowu (in his twenties), towards the railway. Because Laowu refused to walk, the bandits hit his head with a brick, causing serious injuries. Finally, they killed him with a sharp knife and hid him in a tomb. The next day, Lu reported the incident to the Fourth Police Station for investigation. However, the day after that, the Lu family received a letter from the bandits demanding 1,000 yuan and arranging a meeting at Qixing Bridge on the 18th, with sugarcane and cigarettes as the signal. They reported it to the Public Security Bureau, and detectives disguised themselves and waited at Qixing Bridge. A bandit came to inquire and was arrested. He confessed that his name was Wu Er'a (aka Wu Yongcheng), residing at the home of Wu Peihao, Dalong, Jianqiao River, in this city. He also confessed that Wu Yongda and Wu Chengfa were involved in the kidnapping of Lu Laowu. The Public Security Bureau sent police to the home of Wu Peihao in Dalong and arrested Wu Chengfa and Wu Peihao. They confessed the details of Lu Laowu's murder and the hiding of his body in a tomb near Tanghui. On the 19th, the court was requested to conduct an autopsy, and a search was launched for the fugitive Wu Yongda to bring him to justice.</p>

<p>The counties under the jurisdiction of Nantong District suffered severe drought last year, and the current situation in the countryside is extremely miserable. The poor people have started抢食 (qiangshi, to snatch food), called "eating sparrow rice," which is a serious situation. Currently, local communities are gathering to raise funds to go to rice-producing areas to purchase food for spring relief. The commissioner's office also discussed dredging rivers in Tonghai County on the 18th as a work-for-food program.</p>

<p>The Xitangqiao Xiyizhuang in the fourth district of the county belongs to the Pang family in the city. The Zhuang is located in a remote area of the country and the houses are large and unoccupied. The Pang family assigned Si Zhang Lu Junlian to reside in the country to collect rent. Lu brought his son, Dabao, with him. Dabao, who is only five years old, was burning reeds in the wasteland outside the door the other day. The northwest wind was extremely strong, and the fire spread to the Pang family's Zhuang. Soon, it affected neighboring houses. For a time, smoke filled the air and the fire was fierce. Because the countryside lacked fire-fighting equipment, it was impossible to save the situation, resulting in the complete burning of all the nearby neighbors, causing untold losses.</p>

<p>One-sided advocacy is not enough to alleviate commercial difficulties</p>
<p>Deeply afraid that the impact will disrupt the market</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that regarding the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation's proposal to postpone the current general industrial and commercial closing for one year and delay the payment of rent for six months, yesterday, this reporter specially visited Mayor Wu to inquire about his opinion. He gave the following statement: "In recent years, Shanghai has been affected by frequent disasters in various places and the decline of the rural economy. It has also been hit by the combined pressure of global financial and economic pressures. The economic downturn and the difficulties of various industries are unavoidable phenomena. However, recently, due to the efforts of all parties, the economic situation has become increasingly consolidated, and the social sentiment has become increasingly secure. In this environment of significant progress, if we want to gradually restore industry and commerce, we only need people from all walks of life to maintain and work together from the standpoint of the overall social welfare, and it will not be difficult to turn the tide. However, the development of industry and commerce should have basic conditions, namely, the protection of legal rights and the maintenance of industrial and commercial conventions. At present, the advocacy of postponing the general industrial and commercial closing and delaying the payment of rent for six months by some citizens are not in line with legal principles or human sentiment. This kind of one-sided advocacy is not only insufficient to alleviate commercial difficulties, but also may disrupt the market. It is not the way to prosper this city, and it is not what an orderly and disciplined society should have. This mayor cannot sympathize with it."</p>
<h3 id="e137">Japan Resolved to Invade Chahar <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Japanese military publicly issued a statement</p>
<p>Chahar troops have minor contact with puppet troops</p>
<p>The External Affairs News Agency reports that Japan's attempt to invade Chahar has been a fact for two years since the fall of Jehol. At the beginning of the new year, Japan's position in the world fell into a desperate situation of international crisis, so it focused its diplomatic and military efforts on aggression against us. Military actions and diplomatic progress cooperated with each other. In diplomatic terms, people such as Suma and Luye were busy on the road between China and Japan. Suma was particularly active, even hurriedly touring various parts of Northeast and North China on his way to China. In military terms, the special meetings of resident military attachés held twice in Shanghai and Dalian in November last year and early this spring were particularly tense. Until recently, the Japanese navy and army stationed in Shanghai have repeatedly conducted armed exercises and parades, and in North China, they have found excuses to criticize the authorities of Hebei Province and directly provoked the Song Zheyuan troops in Chahar Province. Their evil intentions have almost become apparent. According to a report from Changchun, at 8:00 PM on the 18th, the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army publicly issued a statement, claiming that they would attack our army in Jehol Province, and the wording of the statement about Song Zheyuan's troops was perverse and ridiculously sophistical. It can be seen that the denial of the tense situation in North China by the Japanese embassy in this port was just deceiving themselves.</p>
<p>The External Affairs News Agency reports from Beiping that the news that the Japanese army has been mobilized has been spread everywhere, which shows the tension in Chahar Province. The air force has already moved, and a large number of troops have been transferred from Gubeikou, Luanzhou, Kaiping, and other places to various places on the border of Jehol, including Guyuan. Because of the tense situation in Chahar, Song Zheyuan has sent Qin Decun back to Chahar to deal with it. Song himself is temporarily staying in Beiping because he still needs to meet with He Yingqin. Song told reporters that on January 13, the Chahar army and the miscellaneous troops of the puppet state had a small conflict in Zhangling near Guyuan in eastern Chahar. As a result, the invading puppet troops were repelled. As of now, the situation in Chahar is very peaceful.</p>
<p>The External Affairs News Agency reports from Beiping that according to today's news, the Japanese infantry stationed in Chengde was transferred to Daning and Daguzhen in western Jehol yesterday. Several Japanese aircraft have also been concentrated near Chengde. It is said that this action is the prelude to the joint expulsion of Song Zheyuan's troops by the Japanese and "Manchukuo" armies. The commander of the Japanese army stationed in Chengde recently sent an ultimatum to Song, urging him to withdraw his troops from Jehol as soon as possible. This ultimatum was conveyed to Song by the Japanese military attaché in Zhangjiakou. The Japanese officials in Beiping did not criticize this news, only saying that even if there is action, it will be limited to the local area. Daguzhen is 110 kilometers northwest of Chengde and only 80 kilometers north of Gubeikou.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Central Bank Loans Fully Repaid Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Money Market Eases and Foreign Exchange Rates Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Loans will continue to be issued if requested</p>
<p>In December of last year, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications jointly prepared to release 10 million yuan in cash in order to meet the needs of the market and adjust the financial situation. Anyone with sufficient collateral could apply to the Central Bank for a mortgage, but it was limited to 100,000 yuan per household and stipulated that settlements were made every two days, and every Friday was a three-day settlement. Since the implementation of the loan, more than 50 banks and money houses have applied for loans, totaling more than 4.3 million yuan. After the New Year, the accounts have been returned one after another. Recently, the money market has eased, foreign exchange rates have continued to fall, and the market has become stable. As of the 19th, all borrowing accounts have been fully repaid. If there is a request for a mortgage, it will continue to be lent.</p>

<p>Totaled 3.02 million yuan</p>
<p>Issued a monthly bonus to employees</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, in order to issue bonuses to employees for the 23rd year of the Republic, specially instructed its subordinate departments and offices yesterday, saying, "According to the instruction No. 2626 from the Ministry of Railways on January 11, 24th year of the Republic, it is reported that the net profit of the two railways for the 23rd year of the Republic totaled 3.02 million yuan, and a request was made to evenly distribute the amount of one month's simple salary and wages to the employees of the two railways. After checking, the railway has a large amount of foreign debt, and it is still difficult to raise funds to repay the principal and interest on time. Considering the financial resources, the annual bonus should be stopped. However, considering that the employees of the two railways have worked diligently and selflessly for a year, they have made no small achievements. The various totals in the original calculation table are hereby approved for an annual bonus of one month's simple salary and wages to be granted as an incentive, so as to encourage the future. It is not allowed to be used as a precedent in the future. The rest shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry's Instruction Nos. 2896 and 2897 of the 18th year of the Republic. As for the railway's accounting office's proposal to first issue bonuses to employees with monthly salaries of 100 yuan or less before the lunar New Year, and then issue bonuses to employees with monthly salaries of more than 100 yuan, it should be approved in order to adjust the financial resources, and no loans should be borrowed to increase the railway's burden. Except that we have already informed you by telegram, we hereby order you to comply with this order. In addition to distributing it to the various departments, we hereby urgently inform you of this matter."</p>

<p>4 million yuan pledged for 2 million yuan</p>
<p>Method agreed upon with an annual interest rate of 6%</p>
<p>Zhang Muxian went to Beijing yesterday to report to Hunan and return to his post</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that, according to news from the local banking industry, the Hunan Provincial Government has issued provincial bonds worth 10 million yuan this time, which is an extremely large amount. Selling to the public will take time and the effect is difficult to predict. Therefore, Yu Jichuan, the director of the provincial Department of Finance, and Zhang Muxian, the host of the bond issuance, have come to Shanghai several times to underwrite with the local banking industry. Now, the banking industry has agreed to temporarily pledge 4 million yuan of the bond face value for 2 million yuan in cash, and will continue to underwrite within a possible range in the future. The interest rate is set at 6% per annum. Mr. Zhang Muxian is going to Beijing by car yesterday because he has negotiated a result. He will visit Chairman Chiang and report on the recent financial situation in Hunan Province. After staying for one or two days, he will fly from Beijing to Hunan to return to his post.</p>

<p>Examining the Administration of Various Provinces, Cities, and Counties</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, since Mr. Fu Zuoyi took office as Chairman of Suiyuan Province, he has been working diligently and has achieved remarkable results. Recently, in order to thoroughly reform the administrative organization and train the people for self-defense, he specially appointed Mr. Fan Ku, the director of the First People's Education Center of Suiyuan Province, to go to Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces to investigate county administration. Mr. Fan then set off on the 23rd of last month, passing through Beijing, Jinan, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places, and arrived in Shanghai the night before last. With the introduction of socialite Mr. Huang Jingwan, the reporter met Mr. Fan at the hotel and asked about the mission of his coming south. According to him, he was ordered by the Chairman of the Province to come south to investigate, and the goals were focused on: (1) the organization and training of "defense" people's corps; (2) the basic organization of "autonomy"; (3) "education" of rural teachers and methods of training the people; (4) "cooperation" of production and marketing joint transportation; (5) how to concentrate power and increase efficiency in "administrative organization"; and (6) "new social undertakings" such as production and construction.

<p>According to the Shijie News Agency, Dr. Nagayama, Director of the Astronomical Observatory of the Imperial University of Tokyo, Japan, wrote a pre-discussion on last night's lunar eclipse, which is recorded for reference. Nagayama said that this lunar eclipse is the first since Showa 6 (Republic of China 20). The initial eclipse began at 10:53 pm on January 19, and the restoration occurred at 2:41 am on the 20th, lasting a total of 3 hours and 48 minutes. The total eclipse lasted from 12:03 am to 1:31 am, for a total of 1 hour and 28 minutes. During the eclipse, the moon will appear purple-copper red, because the atmosphere around the earth will be like a prism in a camera, transmitting only red light from the moon to the human eye. As for the cause of this phenomenon, it is because the earth travels between the sun and the moon. When the moon is totally eclipsed, sunlight cannot reach the moon, and the moon only receives light reflected from the earth, so people see it as purple-copper red.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Legislative Yuan has scheduled a joint review meeting of the Finance and Economics Committees on January 24 to discuss the draft exchange tax law. The notice has already arrived in Shanghai, and representatives of the five exchanges have decided to go to Beijing on the 22nd of this month. A preparatory meeting was held yesterday to discuss various important cases and hold an expanded petition. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Notice from the Legislative Yuan <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>

<p>The brokerage associations of the five exchanges, namely, gold, cloth, securities, flour, and miscellaneous grains, held a preparatory meeting at the Cloth Exchange at 5:00 pm yesterday. More than 20 people, including Wang Zhengzhuang, Xie Liansheng, Shao Wenmei, Zhang Weiyun, Xue Chengzhang, and Wu Limen, attended. Bian Futang, the chairman, reported on the Legislative Yuan's notification of attending the review meeting, and then the discussion began. (1) In addition to the chairmen and committee members of the five exchange brokerage associations being representatives to go to Beijing, additional representatives should be selected to attend the meeting for consultation. (Resolved) Each exchange should select its own representatives. (2) The central government should be requested to consider the difficulties of businesses and abolish the original tax collection plan.

<h3 id="e150">Scheduled Trip to Beijing <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, after repeated petitions from the exchanges, the authorities accepted the request and submitted it to the relevant committee of the Legislative Yuan for review. It is now heard that the review meeting has been scheduled for the morning of the 24th in Beijing. The five representatives, namely, Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Miscellaneous Grains Exchange, Zhang Wenhuan, Chairman of the Securities Exchange, Wang Yiting, Chairman of the Flour Exchange, Xu Busun, Chairman of the Gold Exchange, and Mu Ouchu, Chairman of the Cloth Exchange, have scheduled to go to Beijing on the evening of the 23rd to attend the meeting and petition again. Yesterday, there was a rumor that the representatives had already gone to Beijing, which was a misrepresentation.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Petition from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on letters from the Shanghai Chinese Securities, Cloth, Flour, Gold, Miscellaneous Grains Oil Cake and other five exchanges, and the brokerage associations of each exchange, requesting to forward a petition to the Yuan and Ministries to abolish the collection of exchange tax, yesterday submitted a document to the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, stating (excerpt): It has been detailed in the letters from the brokerage firms to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Finance last year and this time to the association members that the business of each exchange has been declining in recent years and it is difficult to bear the new tax burden. What the association wants to supplement and state is that although this exchange tax is taken from Japan's transaction tax, Japan only taxes futures transactions and does not tax spot transactions. Also, their tax amount is based on the difference between the buying and selling prices to prevent sharp rises and falls in the market, while we tax both spot and futures at the same rate, and the tax rate is higher than the Japanese system. All of this is not suitable for the current business situation in our country. Moreover, the main point of this case is not in this. Exchange tax is a type of behavior tax, and its nature is no different from the current business tax and stamp tax in various provinces. After the exchange completes the sale of goods, it is taxed separately with exchange tax, and there is no explicit exemption for other business taxes and stamp taxes that should be levied. In this way, the sale of goods must be taxed at least three times with a repeated behavior tax. In fact, for those that fall under the scope of business tax, one tax for wholesale and another tax for retail, combined with the exchange tax, will definitely be more than three times the tax. In this way, goods are taxed every time they change hands, which is no different from the fact that goods were taxed every time they passed through a place when the likin tax was not abolished. However, in the past, the tax was based on location, and now it is based on people. Therefore, before the system of repeated taxation is corrected, it is not appropriate to implement the exchange tax in a hurry. This is the general expectation of businesses. Furthermore, our country's tax rights do not extend to foreign businesses. Last year's National Finance Conference had a proposal to collect business tax from foreign businesses across the board, but it was not resolved due to the impossibility of implementing coercion. Chinese businesses in Guangzhou also expressed strong opposition to this matter, and the British even expressed their support in Parliament. In the end, the local Chinese businesses had no other choice. If the exchange tax is indeed implemented, it will also be a continuation of the business tax, only levied on Chinese businesses and not on foreign businesses, and the harm will be even greater. Foreign businesses in China only engage in wholesale and rarely in retail, and their territory is limited to treaty ports. Therefore, although the business tax is collected and exempted, it does not have a significant impact on the lifeline of commerce. As for the exchanges, they are the hub for leveling goods and have the ability to control the national market. No independent country would ever allow this power to be granted to foreign businesses. Now, because of the shackles of legal rights, we are powerless to restrain them and can only let them do as they please. Fortunately, the exchanges set up by Chinese people compete in the market, and their momentum has been slightly suppressed. In the future, if the exchanges run by Chinese people are successively subject to exchange tax, while those set up by foreign businesses cannot be taxed, people will be attracted to them like ducks to water. In this way, the ups and downs of the national market will be monopolized by foreign businesses. From the standpoint of the national economy, the disaster, which ancient people called floods and beasts, cannot exceed this. The state's tax revenue will not be enough to compensate for its losses. Therefore, before foreign businesses in China can be taxed across the board, this exchange tax should be delayed for the sake of reason and situation. This is purely from the standpoint of the national economy and is not just pleading for the exchanges. Based on the above two reasons, it is reasonable to submit this request to your Yuan and Ministries for review and approval, and to temporarily suspend the decision and implementation of the exchange tax law that is currently under review. This is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Mingxing to Sail Tomorrow <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Inland Transit Tax to be Exempted Soon</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Dispute Resolved, Sanbei Company Fulfills Agreed Terms, Renting New Ship Mingxing to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Officially Opening Ningbo Route Next Tuesday. Yesterday, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has contracted the passenger tickets of the ship to Zheng Chengye, the comprador of Taikoo New Beijing. Mr. Zheng is scheduled to take over the ship tomorrow. Yesterday, Yu Qiaqing also negotiated the ship delivery procedures at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Mr. Yu has been painstakingly planning the Shanghai-Ningbo line, opening the Zhenhai inland port, so that goods can be duty-free in the future. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e153">Mingxing Officially Begins Service <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Sanbei Mingxing ship, after public discussion, will first be rented by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for one month to replace the Xinjiangtian ship, which is undergoing repairs. The rent is 450 yuan per day. All salaries of crew members and sailors will be borne by Sanbei. Coal on the ship will be borne by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The rent for the first month, calculated at 31 days, is a total of 13,950 yuan. The second month will be re-rented by Ningshao Company for one month to replace the Xinning-Shao route. After two months, if the Yangtze River United Company is established, Mingxing will sail the Yangtze River. If it does not work out, Sanbei will run the Ningbo route on its own. The Mingxing ship will be rented by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company tomorrow, and will officially start sailing on Tuesday.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Zheng Chengye Contracts Passenger Seats <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, originally intended to handle the passenger tickets of the Mingxing ship on a cost-plus basis. Looking around the bureau, Mr. Wu Delin is the most experienced and capable. It is most commendable. When the Mingxing ship starts sailing, it is planned to have Mr. Wu handle the passenger tickets. Mr. Wu is too busy with the public affairs of the business department to take care of this matter. Therefore, the passenger tickets of the Mingxing ship were contracted to Zheng Chengye, the comprador of Taikoo New Beijing, at a daily contract price of 1,150 yuan. A three-week trial run will be conducted first. Mr. Zheng has accepted and has negotiated a contract with the bureau yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Start to Eliminate Bad Practices <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The deepest-rooted bad practices on the Ningbo route are the waiters' tips for drinks, which have the most adverse impact on passengers. Often, the ticket price is 3 yuan, and the waiters' tips for drinks also require 3 yuan. If it is a little less, there will be expressions of dissatisfaction. Various companies have repeatedly discussed reforms, but they have not been able to eradicate this deep-rooted practice. This time, the waiters on the Mingxing ship will implement a new system. The tips for drinks given to each passenger in the steerage class will be limited to one dime and a half to two dimes and a half, and no excessive demands will be allowed. The implementation of this new regulation breaks the decades-long practice of Shanghai-Ningbo ships and benefits the shipping industry.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Yu Announces Statement <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, General Manager of Sanbei, told reporters yesterday that the Mingxing ship's addition to the Shanghai-Ningbo route is purely to help the farmers of Ningbo, the second step is to help Ningshao Company, and the third step is to save the endangered shipping industry and recover a part of the shipping rights. Mr. Yu said that he has been planning this matter for six months and spent more than 400,000 yuan. A wharf has been built in Zhenhai, and a road has been opened to connect Ningbo inland. Ningbo is an important treaty port for the five ports of commerce. In the past, all goods entering and leaving had to pay customs duties. Zhenhai is an inland port. Once shipping is increased, Ningbo goods can use the road to directly reach Zhenhai to disembark and be treated as inland goods, which can be exempted from customs duties. Therefore, I opened the Mingxing ship to help the farmers of Ningbo. As for helping Ningshao, the opening of Mingxing will inevitably lead to competition. After the competition is formed, I plan to replace the Ningxing ship so that the agreement can still be signed and the Ningxing ship can be transferred to Ningshao to help its business development. The third step of saving the shipping industry is even more important.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Promote Tax Exemption <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The government now exempts taxes on goods transported by trains, cars, and even civilian ships, but it still levies customs duties on goods transported by ships. For example, goods from Zhenhai to Shanghai can be duty-free as inland goods, but if the goods are transported to the northern and southern ports, they will still be subject to transit duties in Shanghai. This matter has been repeatedly contested with the government by all parties, and the request for exemption of transit tax on domestic goods has been approved by the central government. It is expected to be realized in the near future. This move will be of great benefit to the entire shipping industry.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Chairman Chiang Praises <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yu also said that when Chairman Chiang came to Shanghai this time, I mentioned to him during the audience that opening Zhenhai would enable the export of inland agricultural products to be exempt from taxes. Chairman Chiang praised this move greatly, saying that the recovered area of Jiangxi is planning to revive the rural areas. After the establishment of the Hangzhou-Jiangxi Railway, in the future, Jiangxi agricultural products can be shipped from Zhenhai and loaded onto ships. Therefore, the importance of Zhenhai port is the gateway to Zhejiang-Jiangxi shipping. It is predicted that Zhenhai port will become an important seaport in the future.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. After getting off the train, he returned to his residence on Gansi East Road to rest. He came here to take care of private affairs and is scheduled to enter Beijing on Tuesday.

<h3 id="e161">Shifted Longevity Gifts from Shi Shenzhi to Famine Relief Donated <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Urgent Famine Relief General Donation Association will soon be established for two months. It has handled various general donations and has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life in the city. Donations have been enthusiastic. It is heard that Mr. Shi Shengzhi's seventieth birthday recently, he specially entrusted the Buddhist Pure Land Society and Wing Hang Bank to collect longevity gifts and donate all of them to public welfare and charitable causes. Yesterday, someone was sent to pay the association 1,000 yuan. Mr. Shi's enthusiasm for urgent famine relief is admirable.</p>
<p>Since the Wealthy Donation has been handled, the wealthy have been able to take the relief of disaster victims as their top priority and enthusiastically pledged donations. However, there are a few wealthy people who treat money like their lives and ignore the disaster victims. It is heard that the Urgent Famine Relief General Donation Association has sent another letter to explain in detail the suffering of the disaster areas, hoping to inspire their conscience and urge them to pay to the association as soon as possible so that the funds can be allocated to the disaster areas for relief. Otherwise, the society will be notified and other countermeasures will be determined.</p>
<p>Since the China Merchants Electric Company received the letter from the Urgent Famine Relief General Donation Association requesting to solicit general donations, it has separately solicited donations from employees and workers. It is heard that the employees have donated 480 yuan and paid it to the Bank of Shanghai. As for the workers, they are still deducting it and will pay it again in the next few days. The Qinfeng Textile Factory deducted 100 yuan from the workers' donations. The Urgent Famine Relief General Donation Association received 600 yuan from the Oil Pressing Industry Association and 3 yuan from Yide Elementary School yesterday.</p>

<p>Severe winter has arrived, and the number of disaster victims in various provinces crying for hunger and cold is increasing. The work of the local Drought Relief Association has also suddenly become tense in recent days. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e163">Survey and Release Personnel Telegraph the Disaster Situation <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Drought Relief Association's second allocation of relief funds to various provinces includes thirteen provinces: Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Fujian (Putian County). The allocation of relief funds is determined by considering the severity of the disaster. The last allocation was a total of 500,000 yuan, and it was decided on the spot that the previously selected survey and release personnel would all be dispatched within three days so that the disaster relief could reach the disaster victims as soon as possible to avoid being forced to death by hunger and cold. Therefore, after the survey and release personnel were dispatched to various provinces, they sent telegrams to the association one after another reporting the disaster situation in various provinces. Many articles are long and detailed, which is heartbreaking to read. Last year's severe drought was a tragic disaster unprecedented for compatriots.</p>

<p>The Two Railway Bureaus launched a campaign to collect winter clothes last year. Within a few months, employees serving in the railway bureaus were able to enthusiastically contribute, totaling more than a thousand pieces. Although the winter clothes are slightly old and tattered, the hearts of the benevolent cannot be erased. Yesterday, the Railway Bureau used cars to transport the Drought Relief Association for counting.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Rural Loans Difficult to Realize Temporarily <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Xu Shiying and others initiated a proposal for government, business, and banking circles to organize a rural loan group to provide fundamental and thorough disaster relief. According to a certain private person, Mr. Xu once discussed this matter with the government authorities during his trip to Beijing last time. Due to various reasons, the government agreed to consider it, but it is difficult to realize it temporarily. This is because the amount of money required for this move is huge and cannot be achieved with a small amount of money. Because the scope of the disaster area is too wide, there are nearly a hundred counties in a dozen provinces, and nearly a hundred villages in a county. The loan for farmers in one village is at least several hundred yuan. Extrapolating to a dozen provinces, the amount required is at least tens of millions, and at most tens of millions. This huge amount of money cannot be borne by the financial community at this time. Therefore, Mr. Xu's previous proposal of 30 million has been temporarily shelved. The only way to thoroughly relieve the rural areas is this. If money can flow back to the country, the rural revival is promising, and the national economic bottleneck can be solved easily.</p>

<p>The Red Swastika Society has previously sent many relief specialists to various provinces to handle urgent relief. It is now heard that the Zhenwu of Hai'ning County, Zhejiang has been completed, and the Zhenwu of Yixing, Danyang, and Jintan in Jiangsu is also actively underway. The report of the Hai'ning County Specialist of the Association and the Zhenwu situation of the Zhenji Team of Yixing, Danyang, Jintan, and Lishui are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Hai'ning Relief Report Yulin and others were dispatched this time to be responsible for the investigation and release of urgent relief in the fourth district of Hai'ning County. They traveled through various villages and towns, investigated household by household, and spent up to 40 days. From December 6 to 10 last year, relief funds were distributed at the Linggong Temple in Chang'an and the Jixiang Temple in Xucun. The relief funds were divided into three levels of morality, goodness, and kindness for distribution, totaling 694 households with the word "morality" receiving 2,809 yuan, 3,784 households with the word "goodness" receiving 11,755.5 yuan, and 4,242 households with the word "kindness" receiving 8,667.3 yuan, totaling 8,720 households receiving 23,231.8 yuan. Also, 1,000 relief tickets from the Jiaxu Jinzhe Disaster Relief Association were distributed, totaling 1,000 yuan. The total amount of relief funds distributed was 24,231.8 yuan. The clinic set up by the Association in the disaster area of the county averages about 200 patients per day, mostly suffering from dampness and malaria. There are also jaundice and lump diseases. It has been open for nearly 50 days and will be closed soon.</p>
<p>Yixing Relief Report The Red Swastika Society Relief Team, led by President Li Tianzhen, Director Ji Baozhen, Xu Yili, Captain Ouyang Dulin, and 16 team members, arrived in Yixing on the 2nd of this month. On the 3rd and 4th, they reviewed the districts and created a disaster victim investigation register. On the 5th, the whole team set off and reviewed the sixth district, giving out relief tickets along the way. The text was completed on the same day, totaling 5,260 households and more than 20,000 people receiving relief tickets. The review of the seventh district will continue on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Danyang Jintan Lishui Relief The Red Swastika Society is handling relief in various counties of Jiangsu. Because the relief team is insufficient to allocate, it specially telegraphed Tianjin to transfer team members south to help handle the relief in Danyang, Jintan, Lishui, Jurong and other counties. After receiving the telegram, the Tianjin Swastika Society immediately sent 12 team members to Shanghai on the Xinming Wheel. After arriving at the port a few days ago, they transferred to Xixi to concentrate and, together with the inspectors from various associations, set off on Qiaori to Danyang, Jintan, Lishui and other counties to carry out the work.</p>

The size of the disaster area is only seen in various counties and urgently needs to be relieved as soon as possible. It is known that Huang Renwang, the administrative commissioner of the Sixth Special District, and Ma Chengji, the county magistrate of Jiande County, came to Shanghai yesterday to beg for relief from major charitable organizations such as the Jiaxu Disaster Relief Association and the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Association. They will stay in Shanghai for about one or two days and then return to Hangzhou to beg for relief from charitable organizations in Zhejiang Province.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce announced to the industry associations yesterday: In this month, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued order 11977, which reads, "The Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued business letter 30947, which reads, "The Executive Yuan issued order 6750, which reads, "The Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee issued official letter 16740, which reads, "I recently received a submission from the Executive Committee of the Hanyang Arsenal Area directly under the Standing Committee, which stated, "I found that the second case of the 33rd meeting of this association stated, "According to the proposal of Fang Jigen, the manufacture and use of party and national flags have been issued and stipulated by the Central Committee, and should be observed. However, the fourteenth article stipulates that the design of the party and national flags shall not be used as any exclusive trademark in commerce, or made into any undignified products." I found that there are currently twelve-pointed sunlights on the market, arbitrarily changing colors, with the store name in the center, similar to the party emblem.

After the resolution, I respectfully submitted it to your association for review, please give an explanation and follow it.

<p>The Judicial Yuan previously approved the Central Executive Committee's Mass Movement Guidance Committee's request for an interpretation of the eligibility of representatives and committee members of trade associations from the Jiangsu Executive Committee. The Council's Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Committee has resolved the interpretation and replied by letter, which is recorded as follows: "If a company or firm sends representatives to attend a trade association, is elected as a committee member of the trade association, and is appointed by the trade association as a representative to attend the chamber of commerce, and the company or firm that originally sent him has closed down, according to the second item and fourth clause of the Revised Guidance Program for Mass Movements, the constituent members of people's organizations are prohibited from participating if they are not currently engaged in the industry. , his qualifications as a committee member and representative should be lost accordingly. This program was resolved on February 2, 22nd year. This Yuan's explanation No. 636 was December 10, 20th year. Before this program was resolved, if a businessman of a company or firm was appointed by the trade association as a representative to attend the chamber of commerce and was elected as a committee member of the chamber of commerce, and the company or firm had changed to another business with different characteristics and joined another trade association, although he is still engaged in commerce, he has changed his affiliation to another trade association and is not allowed to participate in the original association. His appointment to attend the chamber of commerce has also lost its basis. The spirit of the above program is that the qualifications of the representative and committee member should also be lost.

<h3 id="e170">Mr. Nie Lusheng Discusses the Reasons for the Failure of Cotton Mills <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Burdened by Heavy Interest</p>
<p>Hopes for Government Interest Subsidies</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that in recent years, Chinese commerce has been affected by the global economic downturn, leading to a persistent decline. The situation is now particularly precarious, with bank closures, cotton mill shutdowns, and shop bankruptcies being heard of almost daily. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited Mr. Nie Lusheng, a leader in the cotton industry, to inquire about new plans for the development of the cotton industry in the 24th year of the Republic. According to him, the reasons for the failure of the Chinese cotton industry are twofold: on the one hand, it is affected by the global economic downturn and the dumping of inferior goods; on the other hand, it is actually burdened by heavy interest. For example, cotton mills currently borrow a certain amount of money from banks, and the lowest interest rate is 0.9% per month, with some rates reaching as high as 1.1% per month, which is far higher than in foreign countries. Taking countries like the UK and the US as examples, the government provides meticulous protection for various industries. For instance, loans from national banks are interest-free, so factories can naturally strive for development. Looking back at our country, the opposite is true. Therefore, I (Mr. Nie referring to himself) hope that banks that already have dealings with cotton mills can form a banking syndicate and provide loans at lower interest rates, with the highest rate for cotton mills not exceeding 0.4% per month. If this is not possible, then the government should subsidize the excess beyond 0.4% to give cotton mills an opportunity to develop. In addition, experts in the cotton industry should be hired and sent to various cotton mills to investigate whether there are any shortcomings in the factory's work, with the aim of gradual improvement. Only then can the future of cotton mills be hopeful.</p>

<p>This local World Bookstore has always been concerned about the water and drought disasters in various provinces over the years, raising funds for disaster relief with great effort. This time, the drought in various provinces was particularly severe, and the bookstore notified the Shanghai General Distribution Center and all branches nationwide to hold a half-price day successively, donating all the day's retail proceeds to disaster relief. This effort has now been completely concluded. It is reported that a total of 6,945.72 yuan has been raised and entrusted to five charitable organizations separately, including the Shanghai Drought Relief Association for Various Provinces, the China Moral Improvement Society, the Chinese济生会, the Renji Hall, and the Zhenjiang Charity Relief Association, to distribute the funds to disaster areas. It is said that the bookstore is not only working hard to develop itself, but also actively involved in general social undertakings. Even in the current economic downturn, it is still able to sell books to help with disaster relief, fulfilling its duty to help those in need, which is truly commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Releases a Survey Report on Workers' Living Standards <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has always paid close attention to the living conditions of workers in this city. The recently released analysis of the living conditions of workers in the city is particularly detailed. The average income for a family of five is approximately 416.51 yuan per year, while the expenditure is 454.38 yuan, resulting in a deficit of 37.87 yuan. The average percentage of families that need to borrow money to maintain their living is 88%, those who pawn items account for 78%, and those who participate in mutual aid societies account for 69%. Among them, those who live on loan sharking are the most miserable. Food accounts for 53.2% of the total family expenditure, rent accounts for 8.3%, clothing accounts for 7.5%, fuel accounts for 6.4%, and miscellaneous items account for 24.6%. Although food accounts for more than half of the expenditure, the nutritional components mainly come from plants, the quality is poor, and there is also a lack of quantity. Although the percentage of miscellaneous expenses is not too low, the proportion of unnecessary expenses, such as hobbies and superstitions, is too high, while education, hygiene, entertainment, and savings are too low. In large cities, the increase in living standards is actually faster than the increase in wages. Therefore, proper allocation of expenses is particularly important. If attention can be paid to this, the living conditions should not be so difficult.</p>

<p>Entrusting Lawyer Xu Jie and Accountant Xu Chao to Handle the Liquidation</p>
<p>Ruichangxiang Heji Leather Goods Store, located at No. 45 Jiuxiaochang Road in the city, is a sole proprietorship established by Hu Shuxun from Cixi. It has a large scale with a three-bay storefront, specializing in buying and selling fur, tanned leather, and sheepskin from peers in Shunde, Zhangjiakou, Beiping, and this city for more than ten years. It was previously operated by his father. After Hu's father passed away, Hu Shuxun continued the business. In the past, transactions were considered good, but since the January 28th Incident, it has gradually declined. Recently, it has also been affected by the economic downturn, making it difficult to collect payments and causing a severe shortage of funds. Yesterday, due to a lack of financial flexibility, it entrusted Lawyer Xu Jie and Accountant Xu Chao to declare liquidation. However, according to Lawyer Xu Jie, the liquidator of the store, the store's assets, inventory, and claims are sufficient to offset its debts.</p>

<p>The Five Convicts Were Calm and Composed, Leaving No Last Words</p>
<p>Before Execution, They Agreed to Embark on the Journey to the Afterlife Together</p>
<p>—The Convicts Also Petitioned for Fellow Suffering Prisoners—</p>
<p>Ou Zhiguang (27 years old), from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province; Zhang Yushan (30 years old), from Shaanxi Province; Yuan Youfang (32 years old), from Chongming; Zhang Dexin (24 years old), from Panyu, Guangdong Province; and Dong Jiquan (25 years old), from Xuzhou, were all important members of the Communist Party. They organized a "Dog Beating Gang" with the sole purpose of assassinating public officials and surrendered Communist Party members. Ma Shaowu and Huang Yongqing, inspectors of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, were among those killed by them. Subsequently, detectives from the Municipal Police Bureau and the Public Concession Police arrested the five convicts. After investigation by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, they were sentenced to death on November 7th of the previous year. The convicts appealed to the Supreme Court, but their appeal was rejected. Now, the Second High Court has submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval, and it was decided that yesterday morning they would be</p>
<h3 id="e179">Executed by Hanging <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, yesterday morning, the Public Concession Police took the five convicts from the Western Prison and escorted them to the First Criminal Court of the Second High Court. Judge Zhao Zhengcheng and Prosecutor Zhong Qing were seated and ordered each convict to be brought forward and asked if they had any last words to convey to their families. According to Ou Zhiguang, he lived at No. 40 Longmen Road and worked as a cook. "Today I have shed blood, it doesn't matter, there is no need to notify my family." He had a bitter smile on his face. Zhang Yushan stated that he had no address in Shanghai and there was no message to send to his family. Yuan Youfang said he lived at No. 54 Pishao Nai Road, "I can't even take care of myself, why bother with my family? But prisoners in the prison can't get enough to eat. The court should pay attention to this." Zhang Dexin stated that he lived at No. 88 Dede Lane, Chengdu Road, and had</p>
<h3 id="e180">No Last Words <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>He only requested to see his sister, Chen Zhangshi (convicted in the same case and sentenced to three years in prison, currently serving her sentence). The court stated that since she was currently serving her sentence, the request could not be granted. Zhang then continued, "Currently, the prisoners in the Western Prison receive food rations in four grades. The first grade is slightly more, for those who work. The remaining second and third grades are extremely small and insufficient to satisfy hunger, causing prisoners to be pale and emaciated. The south-facing windows in the cells are tightly closed, while the north-facing windows are wide open. In this freezing north wind, prisoners are suffering from hunger and cold. Furthermore, the Western Indian constables in the prison often beat prisoners without asking the reason, even causing them to bleed. When they complained to the warden, they were blamed instead. Sometimes, prisoners would casually chat, and if the constable heard them,</p>
<h3 id="e181">They Would Be Beaten Severely <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>One day, I was beaten by Constable No. 40 in the Western Prison, causing my head to bleed and my chest and back to be injured. Sometimes they even use hanging as torture. Therefore, I ask the court to go and investigate to alleviate the suffering of the prisoners." Dong Jiquan stated that he had no last words, but requested that the five of them be buried together after death and declared the purpose of organizing the Dog Beating Gang. Lawyer Gan Jingxian of the Public Concession Police then presented to the court photos of the convicts and the cash found during the arrest, totaling more than ten yuan. The convicts all stated that the money should be given to Zhang Dexin's sister, Chen Zhangshi, for her use. Judge Zhao verified the confessions and ordered them to be sent to the Shanghai District Court for execution. The Chinese and Western constables then escorted the five convicts onto a car and drove directly to the Jiangsu</p>
<h3 id="e182">Second Prison <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Execution ground for hanging. The Nanshi District Court was notified in advance to send personnel to the execution site for supervision. Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin appointed Prosecutor Ouyang Shu as the supervising officer and led the clerk Zheng Jiyu and inspector Xuan Zhiming. Meanwhile, Judicial Police Chief Chen Junfang and Police Inspector Chen Xihui supervised the execution police Xue Bingzhang, Xu Guoguang, Zhu Baochang, Gao Jinsheng, Zhou Qiwu, Cao Ziqian, Zou Zhendong, Zhou Lianghua, Wang Zhiqing, Zhang Cheng, Zhu Zhiqi, Song Changgui, and Zhao Mingyuan to arrive at the scene by car. By 10:50, the Chinese and Western detectives arrived with the prisoner cars. The execution police had already prepared</p>

<p>Mr. Lu Bohong first ordered the Western detectives to bring each convict out of the prisoner car one by one, sprinkle them with holy water, and have them confess their sins. The convicts bowed their heads and whispered the Catholic prayer, "My soul ascends to heaven." After Mr. Lu finished sprinkling the holy water, the convicts shouted in unison, "Down with imperialism!" Supervising Officer Ouyang Shu took the seat and ordered Ou Zhiguang to be brought forward. He was 27 years old, from Guangdong, and worked as a cook, living at No. 40 Longmen Road. He was asked if he had any last words. He replied, "No need to notify." Next, Zhang Dexin stated that he was 24 years old, from Panyu, Guangdong, and had no occupation, living at No. 88 Dede Lane, Chengdu Road. He had parents and a wife in his hometown. "Our</p>
<h3 id="e184">Current Situation <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>It is not appropriate for our parents to know, as it would only increase their sorrow." Dong Jiquan stated that he was 24 years old, from Xuzhou, Jiangsu, and had no occupation. Although he had parents, there was no need to write a letter. Zhang Yushan stated that he was 29 years old, from Yuncheng, Shanxi, and worked in the fur business. Yuan Youfang stated that he was 32 years old, from Chongming, and lived at No. 54 Pishao Nai Road. All stated that they had parents and wives, but did not wish to be notified. The judge ordered them to be taken down for execution by hanging. The execution police then helped each convict onto the stakes, put hemp ropes around their necks, and tied red cloths on their foreheads. With a whistle from Police Chief Chen Junfang, the five hanging rods were activated simultaneously, slowly tightening. After about five minutes, all five convicts</p>
<h3 id="e185">Died <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The supervising officer personally verified that there were no errors. The execution police then rubbed the convicts' abdomens and felt their heartbeats and pulses, all of which had stopped. The hanging rods were then tightly tied to the stakes. The tongues of two of the convicts were sticking out of their lips, about an inch long. After the hanging procedure was completed, the inspector Xuan Zhiming examined them. The convicts' heads were covered with rush bags, and the bodies were left exposed overnight. The bodies would be collected by the court the next day (today). When the convicts were first brought to the stakes, they greeted each other, saying, "We are embarking on the journey together, so we won't be lonely. If anyone dies first, wait for those who die later, so that we don't betray the meaning of being in the same prison while alive and going to the underworld together after death." They also said, "Please wait a moment, let us talk a few more words." The execution police laughed and replied, "You should go to the gates of hell and have a long talk." When the hanging rods were activated, the convicts were silent. The convicts' attitude was calm and composed, truly unafraid of the law.</p>

<p>Employees Will Return to Work Today</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Shishi News Newspaper laid off a group of employees at the end of last year. The Shanghai Journalists Association held several emergency meetings on this matter and organized a special committee, sending representatives to negotiate with Zhang Zhuping, the general manager of the Shishi News Newspaper, multiple times. The issue has now been resolved, and the employees are scheduled to return to work today (the 20th). The letter from Mr. Zhang to the Journalists Association is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, since our newspaper stopped mailing, our business has been declining daily, and our income has also been dwindling. Our newspaper fears that if this continues, all employees will inevitably perish together. Therefore, we are temporarily implementing a partial downsizing to maintain the status quo. This was truly a last resort. Unexpectedly, this has led to misunderstandings. Representatives from your association have kindly come to discuss the matter in a friendly manner. All misunderstandings have now been cleared up. In this unavoidable situation, our newspaper is pleased to comply with your request and hopes that you will immediately inform the employees to return to work. Sincerely, Zhang Zhuping, January 19th of the 24th year of the Republic."</p>

<p>Lu Xihou, Chairman of the China Industrial and Commercial Bank, was approved for bail by the First Special District Court's Criminal Division on the 17th. However, Judge Yu Changzi, who was responsible for the liquidation process, placed Lu under custody. Yesterday, Judge Yu held another hearing to review the ordinary creditor claims (approximately 400,000 yuan). The representing lawyers Wu Peng, Wang Zhonghuan, and Tang Mingzhi all expressed hope that if Lu could be released, he could raise half of the 400,000 yuan within fifteen days. However, the court stated that since Lu's total debt reached over 940,000 yuan, although the creditor claims of over 400,000 yuan agreed to exempt Lu from custody, if Lu were to flee in the future, the remaining creditor claims would have no recourse. Therefore, it was ordered that Lu post a surety bond of 200,000 yuan to be exempt from custody. Lu's representing lawyers Wu Linkun and others stated that of the 900,000 yuan in creditor claims, excluding the 400,000 yuan in court today, 300,000 yuan belonged to Lu himself and 140,000 yuan belonged to the Siming Bank, with substantial collateral. Therefore, the amount of the surety bond should be reduced, as the 50,000 yuan bond paid to the Criminal Division could only cover creditor claims of less than 100,000 yuan. After Judge Yu considered this, he reduced the amount to 100,000 yuan. Lu claimed that in this economic downturn and at the end of the lunar year, it was impossible to obtain such a large surety bond. He requested that the amount be reduced to 50,000 yuan and that his three defense lawyers and eight or nine lawyers representing the creditors be jointly and severally responsible for the temporary guarantee before finding a surety bond. If a surety bond could not be found within three days, he would still be taken into custody by the court. Judge Yu then adjourned the court. After a detailed calculation of the accounts, he reopened the court and approved Lu to post a surety bond of 80,000 yuan. In addition to finding a new surety bond of 50,000 yuan, the remaining 30,000 yuan was approved to be added to the business guarantee provided to the Criminal Division. Before finding a surety bond, the creditor's representative lawyer and the defendant's representative lawyer were temporarily responsible for the guarantee. A guarantee letter would be submitted to the court within three days. Lu was then released from prison.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Bicycle Industry's Two Associations Petitioned Yesterday <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Repair and Rental Industry Requests Public Utilities Bureau to Withdraw Order</p>
<p>Manufacturing Industry Convened an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shiye News Agency reports that the two bicycle industry associations in this city, the repair and rental bicycle industry association and the manufacturing bicycle industry association, petitioned the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, separately sending representatives to request the repeal of three issues: vehicle registration, stamping hard seals, and increasing the donation by one yuan. They also convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss solutions. The details are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e189">Repair and Rental Industry's Petition to the Public Utilities Bureau <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Repair and Rental Bicycle Industry Association submitted a document to the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, stating: "We are submitting a document to report difficult circumstances and request changes to the measures in order to alleviate business difficulties and maintain operations. Since our association received the Public Utilities Bureau's Announcement No. 226 regarding the implementation of bicycle stamping procedures, we have complied with the order and notified all members to follow the procedures. Now, member companies have jointly submitted a petition, stating that there are many difficulties with the bicycle stamping procedures. We hereby present a detailed explanation to the Public Utilities Bureau: (1) Additional stamping. Bicycles are made up of various parts, such as the frame, handlebars, and wheels. Rental bikes are easily damaged, and the various parts are often exchanged and reassembled. The handlebars of bicycle A are sometimes installed on bicycle B, and the frame of bicycle B is sometimes installed on bicycle C. This kind of mutual assembly and complex circulation means that businesses renting ten bicycles must have fourteen or fifteen bicycles in order to maintain operations. This is because four or five bicycles are needed daily for repair and replacement. Once stamped, if bicycle A is damaged, the parts of bicycle B cannot be used for assembly, which will inevitably lead to a situation where circulation is impossible. The inconvenience is extreme. Therefore, the additional stamping point has practical difficulties and cannot be treated in the same way as privately owned vehicles. We should ask for a flexible approach to alleviate business difficulties; (2) An additional one yuan donation per year. Operating a bicycle shop is originally a small business operation, relying on this small profit to make a living. A donation of two yuan per bike is already a heavy burden. At a time when the market is sluggish, maintaining the status quo is already difficult. If the donation is increased again, it will be difficult to bear. We should ask for the repeal of the order and continue to pay the original donation to alleviate business difficulties." Based on this, the association has already convened an executive and supervisory committee to discuss the matter in detail. They all agreed that the stamping procedures have practical difficulties. Therefore, we are submitting this document to the Public Utilities Bureau for review, earnestly requesting compassion for business difficulties, and humbly requesting approval to repeal the order. This would truly be a benefit for both parties.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Manufacturing Industry Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Manufacturing Bicycle Industry Association sent Mr. Wang to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to petition yesterday morning. He was received by Mr. Xiao, a staff member of the bureau. However, because he did not get to the point, he resigned and returned to the association. The association convened an emergency meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the association's headquarters to report on the petition process and discuss countermeasures. Resolutions were made, but they will not be announced for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Xu Jianhou Accused of Embezzling a Large Sum of Money <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>More Than 20,000 Yuan in Banknotes Stolen</p>
<p>The Defendant Denies Everything</p>
<p>Xu Jianhou, from Dantu, is 24 years old. He used to work as a banknote counter at a certain bank. In May of last year, Xu suddenly left without saying goodbye. After an inspection by the bank authorities, it was discovered that Xu was suspected of embezzling 22,800 yuan in banknotes. They reported this to the police. Because Xu's whereabouts could not be determined, they requested the First Special Court to issue an arrest warrant and offered a reward for his arrest. It wasn't until 9:15 AM on the 17th of this month that Detective Wang Shenqing of the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Xu at No. 2 Baishou Lane, Penglai Road, Nanshi. He was taken to the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. The day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Kang Zengxiang of the General Patrol Room went to take Xu back to the patrol room for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court for prosecution under Article 357 of the Criminal Law regarding embezzlement in the course of business. The defendant hired lawyers Dai Jien and Yin Jingxuan as his defense attorneys. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Concession Police then rose to state the facts of the case, saying that the defendant, Xu Jianhou, was a banknote counter. On May 17th of last year, the head of the bank's cashier department gave Xu 100,000 yuan in banknotes to count. According to practice, if the work could not be completed in one day, the banknotes would be locked in the drawer and the work would continue the next day. However, the defendant left the bank the next day and went elsewhere. It wasn't until June 2nd that he formally requested sick leave. The bank authorities became suspicious. Because it was close to closing the accounts, they conducted a detailed investigation and discovered that 22,800 yuan in banknotes were missing. However, because they did not know the defendant's whereabouts, the bank reported it to the police on July 3rd, requesting that the court issue an arrest warrant. It wasn't until 9:00 AM on the 17th of this month that Detective Wang Shenqing of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to investigate the population in the area. When they checked No. 2 Baishou Lane, Penglai Road, they suddenly felt that the number of people in the house did not match. There was one more person than usual, named Xu Jisheng. He was taken to the Public Security Bureau and identified as Xu Jianhou, who was wanted with a reward. Xu Jisheng was his alias. The patrol room was notified to take him back. However, the defendant only admitted to 6,000 yuan at the patrol room, saying that it was all lost due to unsuccessful gold speculation. The patrol room is requesting that the case be postponed in order to clarify the truth. Zhu Peiqing, the head of the cashier department, then filed a complaint about everything. When questioned, the defendant stated that he had been working at the bank for two years. He denied all the facts stated by the patrol room lawyer and Zhu Peiqing, saying that because his salary was meager, he wanted to seek other developments. Therefore, he requested leave in May and returned to Huizhou to discuss investing and starting a business in Shanghai with his friend Hu Butang. However, after arriving in Anhui, the market was sluggish due to the Communist bandits' ravaging. Hu also had no intention of investing. Because of traffic interruptions, he did not come to Shanghai until January 2nd of this year. What I said at the patrol room was all forced and not factual, etc. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confession and ordered Xu Jianhou to be taken into custody. The trial was rescheduled for seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Public Concession Health Conditions <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The Health Officer of the Public Works Department's December report states that general health this month was good, as in the previous month, so both isolation hospitals were relatively idle, and the mortality rate was very low. The number of foreigners was 7.56 per thousand, the lowest record in history.</p>
<p>In December, one case of smallpox was discovered in the concession, the first discovery since September. The number of vaccinations decreased due to public relaxation and bad weather. However, this disease cannot be guaranteed not to occur again, so it is imperative that those who have not been vaccinated or have not been vaccinated in the past three years seek vaccination for protection.</p>
<p>This month, foot-and-mouth disease was found in livestock transported from the interior, and even in slaughterhouses. This disease did not previously exist in the concession. Now, in conjunction with the Veterinary Division of the Municipal Government and the French Concession, measures have been implemented to restrict imports, which may stop its spread. However, given the severity of the infectiousness of this disease, we cannot be overly optimistic. At the beginning of the month, about 25 to 30 percent of the cattle found in the slaughterhouse were infected, but by the end of the month, they were rarely seen. Presumably, cattle dealers have changed their purchasing locations.</p>
<p>Chinese residents reported 1,124 births, including 608 males and 461 females. As for the mortality rate, it was 9.58 per thousand, a decrease of 8.30 compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>This month, except for a slight increase in diphtheria among the Chinese, other infectious diseases were less prevalent. Sixty people sought treatment at the rabies clinic, of which fifteen were from other cities.</p>
<p>Regarding the health of schoolchildren, 463 students were absent from school due to illness this month, of which only 29 were due to infectious diseases. An ophthalmic trachoma clinic has now been established and is treating many students free of charge.</p>
<p>The average daily milk production was 33,865 pounds, an increase of 4.77 percent compared to the previous month. Two milk samples were found to not meet chemical standards, and five did not meet bacterial standards, all from Class B dairies. The number of slaughters this month decreased due to seasonal factors and increased livestock prices.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Gao Maogong, Strapped for Cash, Was Kidnapped in a Bizarre Incident <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Factory Director Ma Rongguan Was Dragged Down</p>
<p>Mistress Shi Temporarily Leads the Investigation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:50, a kidnapping occurred near the Dada Rubber Overshoe Factory on Zhongshan Road North, Fanhuan Ferry, West Shanghai. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Employed as an Engineer at a Lime Factory <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Gao Maogong, a native of Xinchang, Zhejiang, is 31 years old and resides at No. 12, West End, Zhongshan Bridge North, Fanhuan Ferry, West Shanghai. His wife, Wang, passed away more than four years ago. He has a son named A'da, who lives in his hometown. Gao, not used to living alone in Shanghai, cohabitated with Shi (named Lanxuan, currently 36 years old), a woman from his hometown whom he met two years ago. Gao originally worked at Kong Shiyang Foreign Firm. On September 1 last year, he was transferred to the position of engineer at Shunchang Lime Factory on Zhongshan Road. Because of his meager income, he was very strapped for cash.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Accompanying the Factory Director Out by Car <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Since Gao joined the factory, he has been exceptionally diligent in his duties, and thus highly valued by the factory director. Yesterday morning, after Gao arrived at the factory at around 8:00 AM, the factory director, Ma Rongguan, needed to discuss business and instructed Gao to go out with him in Ma's private City License No. 1741, Concession License No. 4676 Austin car, driven by chauffeur Li Amao. They planned to go to an office in Chengde Lane, Gordon Road. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the vicinity of the Dada Overshoe Factory, four bandits suddenly appeared.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Dragged Ma Down and Drove Off with Gao <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>All four bandits were dressed in black, three holding pistols. Two bandits first rode bicycles and, seeing the car coming from the north, rode forward to block the car. The driver, fearing trouble, immediately braked. At that moment, two more bandits jumped out from the roadside and got into the car, dragging the factory director Rongguan down. The bandit driver drove south across Zhongshan Bridge and turned into Kaixuan Road. At the intersection of Daxi Road, the car slowed down, and the two bandits expelled the chauffeur Li Amao, driving west and fleeing. The two bandits on bicycles also fled without a trace.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Detectives Mobilized to Pursue <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>After the factory director Ma Rongguan was dragged down by the bandits, he ran to a nearby girls' middle school and used the telephone to report to the Caojiadu Branch Bureau. Director Wang received the report and immediately ordered Inspectors Yang and Long to lead all the patrol officers and detectives, including Squad Leader Geng Shouchun, Foreman Cao Chuqiao, Detectives Wang Yixin, Shi Yulin, Li Changfa, Zhang Shaoming, Zhu Bengui, and Zhang Wenbin to pursue in all directions. At the same time, he reported to Director Wen and notified all police stations to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Kidnapped Car Still Not Found <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The entire detective team set out to pursue until evening, but there was no trace of them, and the car was not found either. The chauffeur Li Amao and Gao's mistress Shi were taken into custody. According to Li's statement, he is 23 years old, from Haizhou, and has been working as the factory director's chauffeur for more than a year. He described Gao's kidnapping in detail. According to Shi's statement, she is 36 years old, from Xinchang. She had previously cohabitated with Lü Zhongxu, operating a catering business on Zhongshan Bridge. After separating from Lü three years ago, she cohabitated with Gao. Her remaining words were evasive. Squad Leader Geng suspected her and took her to the headquarters for interrogation. It was then learned that she was naturally flamboyant and proficient in Japanese. She previously worked at the old Toyoda factory, a Japanese company, and now works at the new Toyoda factory as a clerk and translator, earning a monthly salary of fifty yuan. Nearby workers call her a female tycoon.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Dispute Arising from Trivial Matters, Judge Advises to Avoid Litigation <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Plaintiff Accepts Advice</p>
<p>Both Parties Withdraw, Ceasing Dispute</p>
<p>Lu Xingyuan, former President of the Provisional Court and the Court of Appeal, has been practicing law in Shanghai since leaving office, collaborating with British lawyer Gao Yi to establish an office at No. 39 Beijing Road. Last year, due to handling a rent increase case for landlord against tenant Wang Xiqing, the case was litigated in the First Special District District Court. The first instance ruled that the plaintiff's request to increase the rent was insufficient and rejected it. Lawyer Lu, still representing the landlord, appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. On January 4, the Civil Division of the High Court summoned Wang Xiqing and others to appear for questioning. After the judge concluded the trial and announced the adjournment, Wang and others claimed that the remarks made by Lawyer Lu Xingyuan in court that day slandered the appellants. Therefore, they, together with other tenants Yuan Rongyi, Zhang Jingqing, Wang Shizhen, Wang Hu, Wang Meifang, Zhao Helin, Li Jitao, Shi Shouhong, Fan Dingzhang, Zhang Weixian, and ten others, filed a criminal self-accusation against Lu Xingyuan and Sun Guchen, who commissioned Lu to represent the rent increase, for obstructing their reputation, requesting that they be interrogated and punished according to law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special Court opened the trial. Only Wang Xiqing, Wang Hu, Zhang Jingqing, and Zhang Weixian appeared as plaintiffs; the rest appointed Wang Xiqing as their representative. The defendants Lu and Sun both appeared. According to Wang Xiqing's statement, at the trial of the rent increase case in the Civil Division of the High Court on January 4, Lawyer Lu Xingyuan, as the representative of the appellant, stated to the court that the tenants could have increased the rent, but some tenants, as unethical elements, used the rent increase issue to solicit bribes of more than a thousand yuan from the landlord. If the landlord could sacrifice this amount of money, these unethical elements would have no objection. However, the landlord refused their request, so these unethical elements organized a tenant union to obstruct the rent increase and engage in sabotage, eventually leading to litigation. Lawyer Lu repeatedly said this argument up to five times. Who exactly are these unethical elements? Who solicited bribes from the landlord? Lawyer Lu should clearly announce and present evidence, and so on. Lu Xingyuan absolutely denied making such remarks, requested to obtain the record of the trial from the High Court, and specifically filed a counterclaim because Wang Xiqing's allegations were untrue. Sun Guchen claimed that he did not appear at the High Court trial and that the plaintiff's statement that Lawyer Lu's remarks were instigated by him was even more speculative. Judge Huang believed that since people were involved in litigation in court, it was inevitable that they would attack each other. This case arose from trivial matters, and there was no need for litigation. He then advised the plaintiff to withdraw the self-accusation. After the plaintiffs present expressed that they would not accept the advice, he turned to advise the defendant to also withdraw the counterclaim. Thus, both parties ceased the dispute.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Letter to the Provincial Drought Relief Associations</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Temporary Shelter of the Joint Association of Charity Organizations in this city is experiencing severe cold weather and an increasing number of people being sheltered. The existing stock of cotton clothing is insufficient for distribution. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Drought Relief Associations of various provinces requesting donations of clothing to be distributed to help the poor. The original letter is transcribed as follows: "To the esteemed Associations, our shelter is housing poor people and unemployed workers at the Chaozhou Guild Hall and Chaozhou-Huishan Villa, totaling more than 2,400 people. More people are crowding in every day. All the cotton clothing donated by various charity organizations and philanthropists, including the amount saved from last year, totals less than a thousand sets, making it difficult to fully distribute to the poor and causing a great shortage. Moreover, our shelter has no fixed funds. In addition, the drought in various provinces last year was severe, and in recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt and industry and commerce have declined, making fundraising difficult. The number of unemployed poor people is greater than in previous years. The weather is getting colder, and the number of people being sheltered is increasing. We are unable to purchase cotton clothing ourselves. Therefore, we are writing to earnestly request your esteemed association to grant assistance. We hope that you will donate some of the cotton clothing donated by various sectors to be distributed to the poor to help them through the severe winter and get through the end of the year. Your merit will be immeasurable."</p>

It was originally scheduled to be published on August 1 last year. Later, due to the temporary increase in the number of pages, waiting for inscriptions from celebrities, and repeated changes in the color version to achieve authenticity, it has been delayed until now and has not yet been published. It is now heard that all the paintings, manuscripts, and inscriptions are about to be completed. Once the binding is complete, it can be seen by the world.

<p>The weather in this city was warm at the beginning of the month, with continuous rain, still in the spring season of winter. The thermometer often resided between 46 degrees. Unexpectedly, the weather suddenly changed a few days ago, suddenly dropping to about 27 degrees. The north wind howled coldly. Therefore, wool scarves became very popular. The Lianhua Woolen Mill on North Henan Road, in addition to the large output of Three Wheel brand swimwear and real silk socks in the spring and summer seasons, is known for its coarse and fine wool sweaters, vests, and socks for men and women in the autumn and winter seasons. Recently, the north wind has risen, and the cold has attacked the bones.

<p>Held at Paramount Yesterday Afternoon at 4 PM</p>
<p>There are many Chinese people living in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. The number of people returning to China over the years has been increasing day by day. In Shanghai alone, there are already four to five hundred people. The returned overseas Chinese from the area feel deeply isolated and have no achievements, and there is an urgent need to organize a club. Therefore, a tea dance was held at the Paramount Hotel yesterday afternoon to raise funds to serve as a foundation. After a week of effort, the ticket sales were absolutely satisfactory. Yesterday, thousands of people unexpectedly gathered, shocked by the Honolulu music, in one hall, with fragrant clothes and beautiful hair, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. During the dance, there was Honolulu music and songs, enthusiastic and exciting, with a unique flavor. The hula dance of the Honolulu women won the enthusiastic welcome of the ladies in the hall. The flexibility of their waists and the flirtatious dance made people feel out of control. The Paramount singers performed as usual without a program. The guests enjoyed both their appetites and their visual and auditory entertainment, and everyone returned home happily. This afternoon at 5:00, Paramount will hold a tea dance as usual. If you want to get a good seat, please call 30050 to make a reservation.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Termination of Debate Was Revoked</p>
<p>After the Guangzhou Five Hua Bank Shanghai Branch at No. 130 Ningbo Road, Public Concession, and the Baxianqiao Branch at No. 162-168 Mai Gao Baolu Road, French Concession, simultaneously went bankrupt on August 22 last year, ten depositors and current account creditors of the two banks, Chu Longgen, Chen Xianji, Luo Lihua (female), Shi Pengfei, Du Zhiji, Shi Bilong, Shen Peng, Zhou Delin, Wang Fulin, and Pan Yuanji, retained lawyers to file a self-accusation with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District District Court against Fan Shaoliang, Wang Jian'e, Ye Haitian, and Wu Yousan, the vice-managers of the two branches, Xie Shunzhi and Tang Songshan, the assistant managers, and Tang Shoumin and Chen Bingqian, the consultants, for the crime of fraud and breach of trust. They pointed out that the two branches were established and operated in Shanghai without prior approval from the Ministry of Finance for registration, and that they used advertisements for five-year and ten-year plans to lure and absorb savings deposits, and then transferred property and documents before closing down and fleeing, requesting that they be investigated, punished, and fined according to law. The court accepted the case and repeatedly held hearings. The defendants retained lawyers such as Wu Kaisheng and Hua Maosheng for defense. On the 12th of this month, the presiding judge Zhang Chaozuo announced the termination of the debate and that the date for sentencing would be announced later, as previously reported. Yesterday was the scheduled date for sentencing. The plaintiffs and their lawyers arrived at the court to await instructions. The defendants did not arrive. Judge Zhang arrived at Criminal Court One and announced that the case still required detailed research on both factual and legal points, revoking the termination of the debate and reopening the debate, awaiting further summons for trial.</p>

<p>Co-organized by Saint Anna Dance Hall and Yunshang Clothing</p>
<p>The history of dance halls in Shanghai is nearly twenty years, but there has never been a costume ball. This is because organizing such an event is costly, and it is difficult to collect costume samples. Therefore, although there are many dance halls in Shanghai, costume balls have been difficult to realize. The owner of Saint Anna Dance Hall, realizing that a costume ball could increase the interest of dancers, consulted with the famous Yunshang Clothing Company in Shanghai. He received the approval of the company's owner. Many costume samples were ordered from famous European and American fashion designers, all of which are in the 1935 style, with more than 500 styles. Mr. Wang selected 70 styles from the 500 styles and ordered all the dancers in the dance hall to make them separately. The cost is about 2,000 yuan. This matter has been in preparation for nearly two months. More than half of the costumes have been made. Both parties are now preparing everything, and the event is expected to be held in early February. This is also a new atmosphere in the dance world in the new year. It is also heard that Yunshang is offering special discounts to dance enthusiasts and welcomes custom-made costumes of various styles at special prices.</p>

<p>Fulu Garden Restaurant Offers New Year's Eve Dinner. As the end of the year approaches, families traditionally eat New Year's Eve dinner. The dishes cooked by those skilled in cooking are mostly familiar, which is a fact. Those who are not in the culinary industry have limited knowledge, so they cannot innovate. Those who are not skilled in cooking will waste good ingredients, which is a pity. Recently, Fulu Garden (located at the intersection of Niuzhuang Road and Laohe Road, next to Yousheng Travel Agency, phone number 95365) has been particularly prosperous in this seasonal business because the prices are fair, the quantity is large, and the quality is good. The six yuan, eight yuan, and ten yuan "banquets" are most suitable for New Year's Eve dinners at home. Just a phone call is enough to have them delivered on time. This saves the trouble of buying and cooking and allows one to taste different flavors. It is no wonder that those who order dishes are overwhelmed, and their business is booming, surpassing all others in the industry.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Chen Jingzhang's Private Opium Den Was Discovered, He Refused to Appear in Court, and a Rascal Impersonated Him <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The Judge Saw Through the Impersonation in Court and Was Furious</p>
<p>If He Fails to Appear Next Time, an Arrest Warrant Will Be Issued</p>
<p>Recently, Detective Bao Tai of the New Zha Police Station received a tip that Chen Jingzhang (also known as Wan Xie), a runner for the Yongfeng Money Shop on Ningbo Road, is from Shangyu, Zhejiang. In addition to running the money shop, he secretly runs a large-scale opium den at No. 9 Xiangfu Lane, Kader Road, in the Public Concession, exclusively for the consumption of opium by wealthy merchants and financiers from the upper class. His business is thriving, and his customers are always full. Therefore, the police obtained a search warrant. On the morning of the day before yesterday, Detective Bao Tai led Chinese detectives and constables to the opium den. First, they guarded the front and back doors and rushed upstairs. At that time, because it was still early, most opium smokers had not yet arrived to indulge. Therefore, only Chen Jingzhang himself was lying on a couch, smoking opium. He was arrested on the spot by the detectives. In the rooms, they found seven opium lamps, more than ten opium pipes, six opium guns, and more than thirty taels of opium paste. There was also a jade opium gun worth a lot of money, which was presumably used to supply special smokers. With the evidence in hand, they were taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation, Chen only admitted that he smoked it himself and did not provide it to others. Later that afternoon, a lawyer posted bail and released Chen. Yesterday morning, the police filed a public lawsuit, and the case was brought to the First Special Court. Judge Wu Tingqi opened the Eighth Criminal Court for trial. The police lawyer presented the case. However, Chen Jingzhang, fearing punishment, did not appear in court and instead hired a rascal whose name is unknown to impersonate him and appear in court. Judge Wu saw through the impersonation in court and was furious. The police also filed a public lawsuit under Article 10 of the Anti-Opium Law. If Chen Jingzhang fails to appear in court next time, a warrant will be issued to arrest him and punish his illegal activities. Judge Wu then ordered that the hearing be postponed to next Tuesday (the 22nd).</p>

<p>Referee He Chunhui blew the whistle, and the athletes from both sides began to compete. Youyou had the opportunity to kick off and immediately took the offensive, but failed to score. East China took the opportunity to counterattack and penetrated deep into Youyou's territory. Shanfu Zhibin shot at the goal quickly and accurately, and the ball went into the net, only ten minutes after the start of the game.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Ji Liang Adds the Finishing Touch <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>After losing a goal, Youyou worked hard to counterattack. The five forwards were like hungry tigers devouring eagles. East China's goal became a scene of chaos. Xi Qiaosheng and Mao Hongfa had many opportunities to shoot at the goal, but they all missed. East China rose again and made a comeback. Jia Jiliang received a pass from Xu Jingcheng and shot fiercely, hitting the target again. The first half ended here, with East China winning 2-0.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Hongfa Scores Again <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>After Youyou regained a goal, their offensive was even fiercer than before. East China's goal was in a precarious situation. Mao Hongfa received a pass from the center, dribbled slightly to the appropriate position, gritted his teeth, and shot with a bang, the ball entering from the right corner. At this time, the score was 2-2.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Wen Kui Penalizes Twelve Yards <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>

<h3 id="e266">Perseverance and Success <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Li Lai</p>
<p>Little friends, don't you all want to achieve your desires, or want to be a big figure in the future? I can say definitively that "desire is the mother of success," as long as you have perseverance and the spirit of fearlessness to do it, you will be able to achieve it sooner or later. If you don't believe me, I can give you an example:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the king of McDunn hid in a dilapidated thatched hut after failing. At this time, he was very regretful, and his heart of revenge gradually disappeared with it. Later, he suddenly saw a spider making a web on a horizontal and vertical beam. It spat silk six times and finally failed, but it did not regret it. It continued to work hard to spit silk towards the place it had chosen. On the seventh time, it succeeded. This kind of action, an action with perseverance, moved the king. At this time, the king regained his spirits and summoned a hundred warriors to resist the enemy country. Sure enough, in a few days, he recovered the lost territory.</p>
<p>Little friends, "everyone can become Yao and Shun," don't underestimate yourselves. You are the great men of the future, if you have the perseverance of never giving up. Move forward! Your motherland is asking you for help!</p>
<h3 id="e267">Newton's Childhood <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Dan</p>
<p>The great British scientist - Mr. Newton, was very weak when he was young; his mother spent all her efforts to raise him, fearing that he would not be able to support himself. Unexpectedly, he later developed his genius, created a great cause, and was always praised and worshipped by people.</p>
<p>Newton studied at a public school at the age of twelve; however, he was unwilling to study hard and his grades were not good. Later, because his classmates bullied him, he felt very painful, and then he made up his mind to study hard.</p>
<p>He wanted to apply all his knowledge to practice. Knives, saws, axes, and hammers were his commonly used tools, and he practiced his skills very skillfully. Although he was young, he often wanted to use his skills to try them out.</p>
<p>On a road near his village, someone built a windmill. He carefully investigated it, and completely understood the layout of the project and the structure of the machine. In a short time, he built a windmill in the same way and built it on his roof, rotating there non-stop. The internal mechanisms of his windmill were simple and had no difference from the original.</p>
<p>Little friends, we must know that he was able to do amazing things later, not entirely relying on talent, but because he was able to make up his mind!</p>
<p>(Note 1) Investigation means observing and thinking.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Not Afraid of the Cold <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The little hero is willing to endure hardships and is also willing to work hard without avoiding difficulties. However, this kind of courage also requires accumulated cultivation. How can a pampered young master with a fragile body have such perseverance!</p>
<p>In this cold weather, everyone knows not to be afraid of the cold, and everyone will say it, but how many people can actually do it? I saw the foreign little heroes in the concession, wearing short coats, exposing their knees, carrying their schoolbags, and jumping to school in the cold wind and snow. Looking back at our little heroes, some of the parents who love them too much have already told them to warm themselves by the fire in the house and not let them go to school. Ordinary children also wear as bulky as camels, dragging their heavy steps listlessly.</p>
<p>The great British naval hero Nelson is a famous figure in history. When he was a child, he was afraid of the cold and did not go because of the wind and snow. His father said, "It's up to you whether you go or not, but being timid is not the attitude that a real man should have." He listened to these words, and immediately dragged his brother to school.</p>
<p>Little friends, in this cold weather, not being afraid of the cold is the same as Nelson. Then the future achievements may not be inferior to Nelson!</p>

<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. In a flash, it's the winter vacation again. Many little friends are going home with their schoolbags. It really seems like a group of birds out of a cage, jumping around lively.</p>
<p>Dear little friends, during this long vacation, you may forget the books you have read because there is no teacher to supervise you. Even your parents think it's a vacation and let you go. Then you are in great danger. I believe that when you go back to school for the exam, you will definitely fail and not be able to move up to the next grade. This is so terrible and shameful!</p>
<p>Then, do we just study hard? That's not right either. Let me introduce you to Min'er's winter vacation cold relief method!</p>
<p>(1) Get up at seven o'clock, write two sheets of large and small regular script, and do breathing exercises outside the door.</p>
<p>(2) Do arithmetic and draw pictures at nine o'clock, and kick shuttlecocks with my younger brother.</p>
<p>(3) Play the organ and sing songs with my older brother within one hour in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(4) Read Chinese, write new words, and recite at two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(5) Play with classmates at four o'clock. (Or ask my brother to take me to the park.)</p>
<p>(6) After dinner, ask my father to tell stories, or guess riddles with my younger brother, and finally write a diary and go to sleep.</p>
<p>Little friends, you can also make your own schedule and put it into practice.</p>

<h3 id="e273">How Do Animals Spend the Winter? <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>It's getting cold, and we don't see many insects and birds anymore. Where did they go? Little friends, have you thought about it?</p>
<p>Animals, like people, are also afraid of the cold, and they also have ways to spend the winter. Look at the first picture, although the mantis is dead, it has already laid its eggs on the branches in the autumn. The outside of the eggs is wrapped in a layer of gelatinous substance, called the ootheca. The many eggs inside will not die after winter, and little mantises will be born again next summer. Look at the second picture again, as soon as winter comes, ants (so are bees) no longer come out, and hide in their nests to spend the winter. Because they have accumulated a lot of food in peacetime, they will not starve to death in winter. Look at the third picture again, frogs, snakes, turtles, etc. sleep in the soil to spend the winter, which is called hibernation. They don't eat anything at this time, but they won't starve to death, because they have stored a lot of nourishing things in their bodies, and they are slowly digesting there. Look at the fourth picture again, birds and beasts add to their feathers in winter, and their bodies don't feel cold. We humans have to wear more clothes in winter, but birds and beasts will add clothes themselves. Look at the fifth picture again, most of the fish and shrimp in the water hide in the mud under the ice and no longer swim to the surface of the water to come into contact with the cold air on the ice. Look at the sixth picture again, swallows know in advance that winter is coming, and fly to the warm south in the autumn to spend the winter. At the same time, geese fly from the north to our place, because the north is much colder than here.</p>

<h3 id="e274">Omens Before Rain <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Little friends! When you go to school, it suddenly rains on the way, and your head is wet, like a lost chicken. Do you think: How boring is this? Originally, we could just look at the barometer to see if the weather is clear, but do we all have one? I think: Not necessarily! Little friends! The phenomena before it rains are indeed worth discussing. However, before we look at the text below, what changes in the weather before it rains, and what are the different and special places from sunny days? This kind of enlightenment is called an omen.</p>
<p>1. Swallows and sparrows flying high are omens of sunny days, and vice versa for rain.</p>
<p>2. Seeing distant mountains as near is an omen of rain.</p>
<p>3. Hearing distant bell sounds clearly is an omen of rain.</p>
<p>4. Coal smoke not rising is an omen of rain.</p>
<p>5. An eastern rainbow at sunrise, and a western rainbow is an omen of rain.</p>
<p>6. Eastern sunrise with a purple sky is an omen of rain.</p>
<p>7. The call of the hylid is an omen of rain soon to begin.</p>
<p>8. Ants returning to their nests is an omen of prolonged rain.</p>
<p>9. Dew on rice is an omen of a sunny day, and vice versa for rain.</p>
<p>10. Damp ground with sweat is an omen of rain.</p>
<p>11. Steam whistles sounding clearly from afar are omens of rain.</p>
<p>12. A halo around the moon is an omen of rain.</p>

<p>— Bitter</p>
<p>Many people today who use pencils for writing have not researched them in detail, assuming they are made of lead, which is a big mistake. In fact, pencils are made of graphite.</p>
<p>Graphite is mined from the earth, so it is a mineral, black and light in texture.</p>
<p>The materials for pencils are graphite, clay, cedarwood, and rubber. The manufacturing process is as follows: graphite and clay are mixed into a slurry and put into a hydraulic press. The machine has a mold with many holes, the diameter of which is the same as the desired thickness of the pencil lead. The graphite and clay slurry is pressed through this mold, forming long strips of pencil lead. These are cut, dried by a stove, and then they can be used.</p>
<p>The hardness or softness of the pencil lead is not due to the graphite itself, but to the amount of clay in the composition. In addition, the wood that protects the pencil lead must be soft and not easily bent to be suitable for use.</p>
<p>Children, don't look down on this small pencil, thinking it is not worth studying. In fact, everything in this universe has value for research.</p>

<p>— Daosheng</p>
<p>Fish tanks can be made from broken light bulbs. The method is very simple: first, remove the black, hard material on the bulb with a sharp iron tool. This part of the work is not difficult. After the black, hard material is removed, you will see a layer of glass connected to a small glass rod inside the bulb. Carefully break that layer of glass with a sharp nail, and the small glass rod can be taken out. There will be nothing inside the bulb, and it will be connected to the outside world. After adding water, you can raise small goldfish.</p>
<p>There are two small nails on the head of the bulb, which are usually used to attach it to the light socket. Now they can be easily removed. The two small holes that remain can be threaded with a thin string to hang up this homemade small fish tank.</p>

<p>Equine Animals</p>
<p>(1) Hartebeest: Found in Africa, it is a vertebrate, ruminant, even-toed ungulate. Its mane and tail are very similar to a horse. The difference is that it has horns. In the past, some people said it was rare for a horse to grow horns. Now we know that there are horned horses. Do you children find this strange?</p>
<p>(2) Hippopotamus: Also a type of horse, but it does not ruminate. Its body is more than ten feet long, its eyes and ears are very small, its mouth is very wide, its legs are very short, and each leg has four claws with webs connecting them. It likes to live in the water and can swim, sleeping during the day and coming out at night to look for food.</p>
<p>(3) Llama: Found in South America, it is a ruminant, even-toed ungulate. Some people say it is the camel of the Americas. Its body is about the size of a donkey, and it can carry goods through dangerous mountain ridges.</p>
<p>(4) Zebra: Found in South Africa, it is a vertebrate, odd-toed ungulate. Its body is six or seven feet long, its legs are very thin, and its entire body is silvery white with black stripes. Its vision, smell, and hearing are very sensitive, and it runs very fast, making it difficult to catch. Its appearance is also similar to a donkey, so it is also called a striped donkey. Have you children ever seen one in a movie?</p>

<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>As I was telling my story, several people came up on the ship. As soon as they saw me, they knew that I was Sinbad, who had often been on the same ship with them; so I didn't need to spend much time proving to the captain that I was not an imposter. Finally, he said, "Thank God, you are safe. Here are your goods; take them and do as you please."</p>
<p>When those packages were returned to my hands, I deeply thanked this person.</p>
<p>I said to him, "Please take some of my goods as a gift, because you are a righteous man!" But he said that he had no such intention.</p>
<p>So I gave the best of my goods to King Melechi, because he had treated me so kindly. He was very happy to hear of my good fortune.</p>
<p>Before long, I boarded the ship that carried my packages and returned to my hometown.</p>
<p>The people in my house were happy to see me, because I had been gone for a long time and they all thought I was dead. I built a magnificent house, bought slaves and land, because I had decided to spend the rest of my years in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Sinbad's Second Voyage</p>
<p>Soon I wanted to change my life. I volunteered to do business again, so I bought goods and transported them to sea in preparation for the next trip. We traveled to various places, and my goods sold very well.</p>
<p>One day we came to an island covered with various fruit trees. We went ashore, but wherever we went, we could not see any traces of people or animals.</p>
<p>I left my friends and sat down by a stream, eating a hearty meal of the food I had brought. Then I lay down, and soon I fell fast asleep.</p>

<h3 id="e279">Major Financial Players Watch as Gold Market Falls 2.1 Yuan <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>The gold market is quiet, lacking change, and major players are watching, resulting in only 1.9 jiao fluctuations in half a day. This is a typical phenomenon for the end of the lunar year. Since the morning, overseas silver markets saw the British pound rise and the US dollar remain flat. Deferred silver prices in Monterrey decreased, exchange rates remained steady, and spot gold in London rose by 2.5 pence. Off-site preliminary trading initially reached 71.2 yuan, but due to rumors of US purchases after the close of large transactions, most speculative long positions immediately adopted a selling strategy. Major players provided a slight supply, and at one point supply exceeded demand, causing a sharp decline and retreating to within 70 yuan. Low opening prices were heard in the morning, slightly weak. Subsequently, the official announcement of the central bank's listing, with both British pound and US dollar flat and customs gold units rising by 0.3%, and the benchmark gold price at 993.1 yuan, stimulated speculative buying. Major players seized the opportunity to buy at low prices, causing a rebound. However, the major barrier of 70 yuan was never breached, and the banks' appetite seemed full. Buyers returned to activity, and prices fell after rising. However, due to the banks' short-covering, many buyers also bought at low prices, causing a rebound. It was learned that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing showed the British pound up 1.25 and the US dollar up 0.25. The banks still had a selling appetite. At this time, prices hovered around 9 yuan. Later, as more positions were released, the number of sellers increased temporarily, leading to weakness. However, major players bought aggressively at low prices, allowing prices to be maintained. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, still at 6%. Calculated at 1 shilling and 5 pence and 71875, although there was no stimulus, prices subsequently rebounded. The banks' appetite went from full to short-covering. Market prices rose from low to high, but because major players were supplying at the 70 yuan level, it was difficult to break through, and the rising trend was hindered. Supply became abundant, and prices fell back. Trading was limited. Thereafter, supply and demand balanced, and prices hovered between 9.1 jiao and 9.5 jiao, making the situation extremely boring. The overall trend was dull until the noon close. The market situation was mediocre in the first half of the day, making it extremely difficult to stir up any waves. This was because there was a lack of stimulus for prices to rise, and there were concerns about the central bank releasing cash after prices fell, which contributed to the situation. The swap spread was still around 7 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 969.9 yuan, down 1.7 yuan from the previous close. Hengchangyong first sold and retreated to 8.8 yuan. The central bank's listing was announced, and customs gold rose by 0.3%. Yongli, Hengyu, Yuanchangyong, and others increased positions, rising to 70 yuan. Mitsui sold US dollars for February at 0.5 yuan, and speculative investors, as well as Changda, Hengxingyuan, Chenyu, and Hengyu sold, retreating to 68.2 jiao. Fuxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Dacheng, and others bought at low prices. Wahbi short-covered February sterling at 0.5 pence, gradually rising to 9.9 jiao. It was learned that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing showed the British pound up 1.25 and the US dollar up 0.25. Dafayong and Yongli sold positions and retreated to within 9 yuan. Hengyu increased positions and fluctuated around 9 yuan. Wahbi, Mitsui, and Shanghai sold US dollars for March at 0.375. Zhaofengchang, Fuxingyong, Dafayong, Shunli, Qianheng, and others sold positions, falling to 8.1 jiao. Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Hengchangyong, Yicheng, and others bought on behalf of others, gradually rebounding. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Subsequently, prices rebounded to 9.7 jiao. Fuxingyong tried hard to sell positions, and Dingchang and others also sold, retreating to 8.5 yuan. Wahbi bought February US dollars at 0.625. Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, Fuyu, and others bought, rising again to 9.9 jiao. Dadecheng, Yuanyi, Ruixing, and others sold, retreating to 9.1 jiao. Thereafter, the overall trend was stagnant. Fuxingyong, Shenkang, Yongli, Dafayong, Fuyu, and others gradually maintained positions at low prices. The trend was up, but the range was extremely narrow, extending to the noon close at 969.5 yuan. After the close, Fuxingyong, Dadecheng, Yicheng, Qingyu, and others competed to buy, once rebounding to 71 yuan. Fuyu, Hengxingyuan, Wanxing, and others sold positions at high prices, retreating again to within 70 yuan. The final struggle was around 70 yuan. The fluctuations in the first half of the day were narrow, with the highest price at 970 yuan and the lowest price at 968.1 jiao, a difference of only 1.9 jiao. As a result, the price fell 2.1 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the central bank's benchmark gold price, rose to 993.1 yuan, about 23 yuan higher than the closing price, more than 3 yuan higher than the previous close. The registered price for February was 963 yuan, and for March 970 yuan. The water supplement in the morning was 953 yuan. The price of pure gold was 96.9 yuan. The spot market was stable, with only 800 taels sold by the Tianjin group to Dafengheng, with an additional 4 yuan. The swap spread was 7 yuan and 7.1 jiao, sold by Fuchang to Ruixing for 770 positions and Tongfengheng for 175 positions. Huixiang had 7 positions, at 7.1 jiao. Yingfengheng short-covered 21 positions, at 7 yuan. Xiangfeng sold. The central bank's appetite was stable. Trading in the market was limited. In total, Hengyu, Dafayong, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Hengchangyong, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Yongli, Shenkang, Fuxingyong, and others were on the buying side. Dachangxiang, Shunmao, Fuyu, Yuanyi, Hengxingyuan, Dingheng, Tongfu, Shunli, Wanxing, and others were on the selling side. Qingyu and Fuxingyong first sold and then bought. Fuyu and Yuanmaoyong first bought and then sold. The Dalian group's Wanxing did a total of around 500, slightly more short-covering. Shunli did a total of more than 200 positions, slightly more short-covering. The Guangdong group's Shengda and Hengxing still lacked wholesale transactions. The total number of transactions for the day was only 15,456 positions.</p>
<p>The number of positions for February is decreasing daily. In total, Hengyu had more than 900 positions on the buying side, Futaiheng and Dingyong had more than 700 each, Fuxingyong had more than 300, and Fuchang and Ruikang had more than 200 each.

The total number of remaining positions was 4,543.</p>

Deferred silver prices in Monterrey fell by 0.5 hao to 0.04. London's spot gold rose by 2.5 pence. Sterling to US dollar remained unchanged. Sterling to French franc fell by 13 pounds. US dollar to British pound remained unchanged. US dollar to French franc rose by 1.25 fen. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices: sterling at 1 shilling and 5 pence 1875, and US dollar at 34.9375 yuan. Futures were tighter at 0.0625, compared to the previous close, sterling remained flat and US dollar tightened by 0.0625. The central bank's listing was announced, with both sterling and US dollar flat, and customs gold units rose by 0.3%. However, domestic banks still had a selling appetite, leading to early signs of easing. However, thanks to Chinese merchants short-covering US dollars and shorting sterling, the situation was maintained. After the listing by Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, sterling rose by 1.25 and US dollar rose by 0.25. The underlying trend was still slightly easing. However, due to the lack of large transactions, banks had different supply and demand appetites, so the situation remained stable. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, and had little impact. However, banks traded against each other thereafter, and the process was extremely mediocre. The balance of power between supply and demand resulted in a lack of change. Until the close, the near-term selling prices were: sterling at 1 shilling and 5 pence 1875, and US dollar at 35 yuan. Compared to the previous close, both sterling and US dollar were flat. Chinese merchants slightly short-covered sterling and more than 100,000 US dollars. Banks' appetites were normal, with a slight trend of short-covering near-term and shorting far-term. The half-day transaction records are listed below.</p>

<p>Interbank Lending Rate Drops Again by 0.03... All "Floating" Loans Are Ultimately Meaningless</p>
<p>In recent days, the silver dollar market has been gradually declining, returning to its former state. The interbank lending rate in the market has also been falling daily. Yesterday, it fell to 0.12 yuan, a further decrease of 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day. The practice of adding water to "floating" loans, due to the loose and excessive funds, is ultimately meaningless. Interbank lending transactions are also extremely sluggish. In the early morning, transfer transactions were only over 1.7 million, new transactions were over 300,000, and in the afternoon, there were over 500,000. Transactions in the Small General Association were over 600,000. Silver-backed loan transactions included over 600,000 in redemptions and over 800,000 in new loans. Banknote transactions included over 500,000 in collections and over 800,000 in issuances, plus over 900,000 in marked banknotes and over 600,000 in cash collections. Bank receipts and disbursements included over 1.7 million in foreign banks' receipts and disbursements of bills, over 3.7 million in various foreign exchange and collateral miscellaneous receipts and disbursements, over 1.3 million in year-end settlements, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlements, over 600,000 in special foreign exchange, and over 500,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks' receipts and disbursements included over 2.0 million in receipts and disbursements of bills, over 3.8 million in various foreign exchange, collateral, tax, and miscellaneous receipts and disbursements, over 500,000 in foreign exchange settlements, over 800,000 in special foreign exchange, over 1.5 million in year-end settlements, and over 300,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Japanese banks' receipts and disbursements included over 1.8 million in receipts and disbursements of bills, over 1.3 million in year-end settlements, over 3.3 million in various goods and foreign exchange miscellaneous receipts and disbursements, over 500,000 in special foreign exchange, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and over 400,000 in warehouse entries. Qianzhuang's silver public receipts and disbursements were over 35 million, silver "floating" receipts and disbursements were over 4.2 million, various exchange receipts and disbursements were over 500,000, inbound sources were 200,000, and outbound disbursements were 350,000.</p>
<p>On the 19th, the total number of exchanges at the local bill exchange was 7,775,362.41 silver dollars, including 2,878,255.14 silver dollars in cash and 4,897,107.27 silver dollars in interbank transfers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan silver dollars were still 857 yuan in the morning market. Trading was brisk in the afternoon market, rising by 2.5 yuan to 859.5 yuan, resulting in an increase of 2.5 yuan from the previous day. Trading volume was 3,000 silver dollars in the morning market and 8,000 silver dollars in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars also rose by 2 yuan in the morning market, to 756.5 yuan. The afternoon market slightly retreated by a fraction of a yuan, to 756.2 yuan, resulting in an increase of 1.7 yuan from the previous day. Trading volume was 220,000 silver dollars in the morning market and 60,000 silver dollars in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 306,000 wen, a decrease of 2,000 wen from the previous day. The trading volume was 28,886 strings of wen, equivalent to 9,600 silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Securities and Bond Market Increasingly Anxious <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>Supply Exceeds Demand, Market Sentiment More Weak</p>
<p>Prices Drop Gradually by About 0.5 Yuan Per Transaction</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange's market sentiment remained extremely weak. The overall situation seemed very tense. Despite the interbank lending rate easing to 0.13 yuan, the silver supply became increasingly tight. This contradictory trend further weakened the long positions. As the end of the year approached, those needing funds were reducing arbitrage trades, further diminishing trading. Major short players only made some swap deals and did not continue to cover their positions. The situation on the trading floor also felt increasingly anxious. Trading was gradually becoming more active. Numbers 4, 47, and 48 were consistently selling, while numbers 11 and 16 had more selling than buying. Numbers 5, 23, and 50 also had more selling. Buying interest was stronger from numbers 14, 43, 77, and 78. Buying and selling was still unbalanced, with supply exceeding demand. The future may be difficult to stabilize. Throughout the day, prices trended downwards. Fortunately, buying interest pulled up the market, slowing the decline. The market opened down by 0.5 yuan in the morning. Selling pressure remained in the second transaction, falling another 0.02-0.03 yuan. Afternoon news was unfavorable. The opening and closing prices continued to decline, with each transaction falling by 0.02-0.03 yuan. As a result, market prices continued to decline by 0.12-0.67 yuan. The total trading volume was 15,116,000 yuan. The resulting increases and decreases are listed in the comparative table on the left (units in yuan, trading units in hundreds of yuan).</p>

<p>According to a report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm, the New York stock market yesterday (18th) was firm and trading was slightly more active. American Wireless Corporation announced the payment of accumulated dividends of $9.625 on its Class A preferred stock. The stock price soared, breaking its highest record since 1928. Steel and precious metal stocks both rose. Wall Street speculators' fear of the Supreme Court's gold clause ruling was not as great as before, but their attitude remained cautious. Most wanted to wait and see the announcement of the ruling and its consequences, so they adopted a wait-and-see approach. Furthermore, speculators did not want to comment on Roosevelt's social security plan before it was enacted into law. According to experts, the plan did not include heavy taxation of industries, so it would not affect the market. Speculators seemed more fearful of other plans, such as the 30-hour workweek and the establishment of a central bank. The bond market trended higher, and the small exchanges were stable. The total trading volume for the day was 680,000 shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e285">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Hit by Rumors <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen for two consecutive days, turned downward again. According to rumors in the market, Tongcheng Company would not accept delivery of goods sold this month. Another rumor was that more than 1,000 bales of 20-count Fugui yarn would be delivered. Furthermore, news reports indicated that the situation in Chahar suddenly became tense, leading to increasingly despondent sentiment. Selling pressure suddenly increased, and speculative long positions sold off their holdings, causing market prices to fall.</p>
<h3 id="e286">This Month's Tongcheng Company Closed Out Long Positions <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the yarn market, the market sentiment was still firm due to the intense rise in Indian cotton and the good situation of the previous day. When the price was bid to 32, signs of softening gradually appeared. This was because Tongcheng Company closed out its large amount of sales for this month. The morale suddenly turned sluggish. The near-term futures fell 3.5 jiao, and the far-term futures fell 1 jiao. In the afternoon, there were rumors in the market that Tongcheng branch not only did not receive goods for this month but also delivered 1,200 bales. Most people's attention was also focused on the Chahar issue. As a result, the market sentiment for this month was particularly weak. The near-term futures loosened, and the far-term futures fell even more. In the end, the current month fell another 7 jiao, and the far month fell 4.6.7 jiao. It was found that Dafu sold 1,100 bales, Junchang 300 bales, Dachang 300 bales, Dafeng 1,150 bales, Daji 1,050 bales, and Hengde 300 bales.

<p>The cotton market suddenly weakened, and the situation was unusually sluggish. It was said that the amount of cotton released by the Inspection Office for this month increased to 4,000 dan. Therefore, although Indian cotton rose 7.75 rupees, American cotton fell. At the same time, the yarn market news was not good, and long positions were closed out. As a result, the market price was not strong and declined.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Zheng Biao Closed Out Long Positions <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the cotton market, Indian cotton White Loch rose 7.75 rupees alone, but American cotton fell back 15 points. The market sentiment was not tense. At the same time, the yarn market was sluggish, and deliveries for this month continued to be released at 2,000 dan, totaling approximately 4,000 dan. The gold price was flat, and the exchange rate was slightly higher. The market became looser as the bidding progressed. As a result, the current month fell 2 jiao, and the far month fell 5 fen to 1 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that the off-exchange price of Indian cotton fell back 4-5 rupees, and the market was particularly weak. The selling pressure was strong, and long positions were closed out. All months fell 1 jiao to 1.5 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, prices for all months rose 3 to 5 points due to good news from Liverpool and purchases by foreign merchants. Subsequently, the Bankhead Act set a quota of 10.05 million bales, which, calculated at 478 pounds per bale, was actually 11.7 million bales. Long positions were closed out, and local merchants sold, resulting in a softening. At the same time, there were rumors of organizing a cooperative association to resist the 1935 loan program, causing long-term selling. Industry peers still bought, but most demand was poor, as the gold clause issue was difficult to grasp. The closing price was flat, with spot goods falling 15 points and futures falling 12 to 14 points. (Haest reported that British mills used 18,000 bales of American cotton this week, and British cotton stocks were 292,000 bales.) American cotton initially rose following American news and then returned to stability. Spot goods rose 2 points, and futures rose 4-5 points. Indian cotton rose sharply due to large purchases by futures traders and short covering. Phalgur rose 3.25 rupees, Omra rose 4.25 rupees, and White Loch rose 7.75 rupees.

<h3 id="e293">Grain and Flour Market Pulled Up by Foreign Wheat <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for all months turned stable. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago rose about 4 to 16 points, and the price in Canada rose about 8 points. When the prices opened, the slightly better price of foreign wheat stabilized morale. The current month's trend was stable due to slight buying by merchants. For the far-term months, factories continued to sell, but merchants from the north also continued to absorb them, so the market gradually became profitable. When the market opened in the afternoon, the trading volume for all months was slightly light. Although the opening price was slightly better than in the morning, it softened again due to further sales by factories. It was found that the market had fallen more than 1 jiao in the past half month. If there is no support from foreign wheat in the future, it should be able to stabilize in the past. In the end, the current month rose slightly by 2.5 li, February rose 5 li, March rose 2.25 fen, April rose 2 fen, May rose 1.75 fen, and June rose 1.25 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Futures Wheat First Fell, Then Stabilized <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the prices for all months showed a trend of first falling and then stabilizing. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago rose 4 to 16 points, and the price in Canada rose 8 points. When the prices opened, the current month was approaching delivery, and the previous day's loose spot wheat caused morale to feel extremely weak. The lowest price fell to 6.3 jiao, a drop of 4 jiao compared to the initial opening of the market this month. The far-term futures remained stable because short covering did not move. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was still flat at first, but then the market gradually improved as the flour market rose. However, near-term and far-term trading became sluggish. In the end, the current month did not move, February rose 2 fen, March rose 2 fen, and the rest did not open. Since the mills did not move, there was no spot trading.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat market: Argentine supply prices were slightly firmer, and the Far East continued to need Australian wheat. The southwestern market was slightly firm. The winter wheat area was dry, and the snow cover was not thick. However, the surplus of Canadian wheat available for export reached 275 million bushels, and the price was too high. This matter should also be considered. The amount of buying was still too small.</p>

<p>24,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Continued to Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market: the market was still good in the morning. Foreign merchants intended to call for higher prices by selling goods because the production was still firm and there was no interest to be gained from the current orders. However, the importers were unwilling to lower prices, so futures were not sold. Spot foreign rice was still handled smoothly by local and inland merchants. There seemed to be a rising trend in the morning. In the afternoon, 20,000 bags arrived from Saigon and another 4,000 bags were transferred from Hong Kong. The importers' appetites turned sluggish, and the market also held steady. The total daily trading volume was 3,500 bags of Saigon rice and 1,700 bags of rice. Recently, there has been a slight arrival of customer rice, and the sales have also been active. The market is in a stable situation. More than 3,000 bags were opened yesterday and were still handled by local and inland merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The market price did not move.</p>
<h3 id="e296">The River Down Rice Market Turned Weak <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources for various merchants were scarce again, with only over 30 ships arriving (a total of 5-6,000 shi). The retail market and the mill's appetites were also sluggish, so the market was particularly flat. Fortunately, the arrivals were scarce, and the arrivals and sales were balanced, so the market could still be stable. However, the environment was poor, and morale was relatively low. Although the prices of various grades of thick japonica rice and late rice did not fluctuate much, the situation was inevitably soft. The market for varieties such as Dujian and Yinbian Yuan was also weak because the sales channels turned sluggish.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 ships arrived from various routes down the river. The market's appetite for various colors of glutinous rice was still weak. Bian Yuan was slightly traded, and the prices of thin rice and early rice were slightly reduced. The remaining goods were sluggish. The market price of white glutinous rice was also stable. The middle and lower grades were slightly weaker. Bian Yuan fell in price by 1-2 jiao. The remaining goods, except for the continued slight decline in thin rice, showed a downward trend.</p>
<h3 id="e297">Foreign Sesame Rose Another 3 Jiao <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>—Yellow Bean Factory Demand Still Strong—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the appetite for foreign sesame was still strong. A total of 1,400 tons were traded in the market, with delivery scheduled for January and February. Most of it was handled by Yige, and the rest was handled by Sassoon. The market price rose another 3 jiao, opening at 10.05 yuan. The overall trend was still strong. Spot trading was extremely lively. A total of 1,6-700 bags of various sesame varieties were traded in the market. The market price increased by 6-7 fen. The situation followed the strong trend of foreign merchants' net goods.</p>
<p>Recently, several factories had strong demand for yellow beans, so the price continued to rise by 8-9 fen. It was estimated that there were about 18-9 vehicles of Dalian beans, 800 silk bags of Hankou vehicle beans, over 3,000 bags of Gui beans, 2 vehicles of Yingzhou beans, 2 vehicles of Bengbu beans, 300 bags of Tancheng beans, over 300 bags of Shashi beans, 2,500 bags of Hankou beans, 580 bags of Hankou late beans, and 1 vehicle of Niuzhuang white flat beans. Most of the sales were to oil mills, and the rest were for export and to local inland areas.</p>
<h3 id="e298">Sugar Market Chaoqing Sugar and Foreign Plates Slightly Decreased <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat. Due to Saturday, there was not much trading. Moreover, the Lunar New Year is approaching, and sales after that may be difficult to be smooth. The association's plate for 24 coarse sand white and spot goods was 18.73 yuan, which was 3 fen better than before. Dutch red was quoted at the original price but not traded. Taikoo sugar B mark was 19.15 yuan, down 5 fen from the previous day. The local factory's first-grade fine white sugar was 18 yuan. The current goods that could be delivered from Chaoqing were 10.8 yuan, followed by 10.45 yuan to 9.8 yuan. The middle and lower grades were 1-2 jiao lower than before.</p>
<h3 id="e299">North-South Goods Haikou Branches Opened 2,600 Boxes <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>Decreased by 5 Jiao</p>
<p>Haikou branches had not been opened for a long time due to the poor market. However, the total number of goods arriving before and after was less than 3,000 boxes. Now that the end of the total settlement period was approaching, there was no hope of rising prices. Therefore, after both the merchants and the dealers contacted each other, their opinions gradually converged. In the past two days, after evaluating the various goods, they decided to open all of the remaining 2,600 boxes, which was 5 jiao lower than the previous plate. The distribution was handled by various firms.</p>
<h3 id="e300">Oil Market <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>Asphalt Arrivals Scarce, Market Tight</p>
<p>The arrival of asphalt from various places was scarce, especially from Hankou. This was because after strict management by Zao, there was even more shortage of spot goods in the Hankou market. It was also heard that dealers still had a certain amount of orders, so even with a small number of arrivals, dealers and agents competed for them, resulting in a tight market. Heavy Jing oil had already reached over 12 liang, and those with wood also required 12 liang. As such, it was undeniable that there were not many arrivals in the Hankou market before the final settlement, and the inventory was low. Local dealers in this port also did not have any accumulation. Fortunately, the sales market this winter was not as strong as in previous years, so it was barely able to cope. If it had been as strong as in previous years, the shortage would have been even more severe. Due to only 30% harvest this year, the local vehicle oil from Jiaxing in western Zhejiang has not yet arrived in Shanghai. According to the current market price, it costs 22 yuan per dan to deliver to Shanghai, which is more than 2 yuan higher than Hankou Jing oil. Although the quality is said to be better, the price feels too high and seems not cost-effective. However, there are occasional candle makers who need it and must use it, so they purchase a small amount to add some embellishment.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Metal Bamboo Steel Bars' Arrivals and Sales Are Smooth <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>—White Lead Skin Market Still Sluggish—</p>
<p>Although the new arrivals of bamboo steel bars are smooth, the sales are also strong, so the market is very lively. The prices for various styles are between 170 yuan and 120 yuan. Among the trading merchants, those from Fuzhou, Hankou, and Qingdao are the most active. Among the local businesses, the construction industry is the most enthusiastic. It was found that a total of 3-400 tons have been traded in the past few days. It was heard that over 100 tons of next year's goods have also been thrown out, and the price is 1-2 yuan better than the current market.</p>
<p>Although industry peers are working hard to promote white lead skin these days, there is still little development due to the approaching settlement period and tight credit. Although the foreign price is rising, there is still no possibility of improvement. Therefore, the best-selling style is estimated at 26.5 yuan per dan, the ordinary style is estimated at 25 yuan, and the best fruit tea color is still quoted at around 24 yuan. It is heard that when the tea merchants and printing houses start business next year, the market price may increase.</p>

<h3 id="e321">Ms. Hua Luoshen Speaks on Chinese Women's Issues <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Qing</p>
<p>According to the "Shishi Xinbao" of the 13th of this month, the Beiping Women's Federation recently invited Madam Hua Nan Gui, former Director of the Beiping Municipal Bureau, to give a lecture. It is said that she is of French nationality, proficient in literature, and has written famous works such as the film script "Love and Sacrifice" and "Wen Xing," which were adopted by Lianhua Film Company.</p>
<p>The topic of the lecture was "Chinese Women's Issues." According to her, Chinese women have three problematic areas: (1) Chinese women do not pay attention to hygiene, (2) they have bad habits, and (3) they do not like to read books and newspapers.</p>
<p>This is what is called a problem!</p>
<p>This is indeed a problem, but generally speaking, isn't this the issue facing the majority of Chinese women? This is just a problem for the wealthy women and ladies of China. They eat well, dress well, and do not need to work. If they do not learn some bad habits such as playing mahjong, smoking opium, drinking alcohol, etc., how do you expect them to live? Smoking opium and drinking alcohol are naturally unhygienic, but what use is reading books and newspapers to them? - Maybe they will read newspapers, but what they mainly read is probably about dog racing, horse racing events, and sensational, erotic movie advertisements, which have nothing to do with Chinese society or the liberation of Chinese women.</p>
<p>If the problem is understood in this way by Ms. Hua Luoshen, then the solution to the problem is naturally limited. It is said that she suggested "creating a type of small ticket, similar to a postage stamp, and affixing it to envelopes, sending them everywhere, so that people will see it and be alerted..."</p>
<p>This is the solution to women's issues! If this can really "alert" those degenerate women and make them realize something, that would indeed save a lot of effort. However, I think the problem will have to be prolonged. Even if they want to change this kind of life, how will they live their lives in the future! - History has destined them to be upper-class women who do not need to work.</p>
<p>The issue of Chinese women cannot be grasped on such superficial phenomena by a woman who is "proficient in literature." The women's issue is originally just a link in the entire social issue. To trace the root of its occurrence, it is necessary to investigate the social system that forms the women's issue.</p>
<p>The tragic situation of Chinese women, I think, cannot be seen by the eyes of a public official's wife. Almost no one needs to "alert" them. Life experiences will show them: they feel pain, they feel uncomfortable!</p>
<p>Indeed, the majority of Chinese women are unhygienic: their living conditions do not allow them to be "hygienic" at all. Chinese women have to start working for more than ten hours a day before they are fully developed. Chinese female workers are not allowed to take leave to rest during pregnancy by factory owners. Unemployed women in China, women trafficked from rural areas, they are forced to work as prostitutes, and thus, to meet the needs of the upper class, they become accustomed to some bad habits... Are all of these their wishes? Are they their own sins?</p>
<p>The majority of Chinese women grow up under the educational principle of the feudal consciousness that "a woman's lack of talent is a virtue," or they are rejected by capitalistic commercial schools, making most of them illiterate. Talking to them about reading books and newspapers is clearly putting the cart before the horse, isn't it?</p>
<h3 id="e322">The Intellectual Women of Hengyang <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Hengyang is a county town on the bank of the Xiang River in Hunan.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is not a very backward place. On the contrary, it is very dynamic because it is a transportation hub that tightly controls the upstream cities of the Xiang River, second only to Changsha, the provincial capital. The people are rich in barbaric temperament, and often fight and shed blood over trivial matters. - Women growing up in such an environment, in schools, often launch struggles to expel incompetent teachers because of their own interests; in society, there are also rare cases of sacrificing for the revolution. But all of these now seem to have become relics of the past, and like the civil rights movement to win female seats in the county council at that time, they have faded away lonely. Intellectual women have become more vulgar and more corrupt. The blood of revolutionary women has not inspired their self-awareness, self-confidence, and glorious memory, but what revolves around their lamb-like minds is: "That kind of sacrifice is terrible, we should protect ourselves wisely; what does it mean? Life is only a hundred years!" Due to the disillusionment given to them by democratic slogans, they are at a loss and can only drill deeper into the "selfish" corner, wasting that pitiful, cowardly life. However, the economic panic of the times does not allow them to live a life of "non-contention with things." They fight each other openly and secretly to seize the positions in a few small schools. Therefore, the interest struggles of female students are often confused and used as a tool for the struggle for someone's private position. In various government agencies, there are not one or two women as decorations. As for women's organizations, not to mention, they are completely zero.</p>
<p>In this way, women who have left their hometowns and obtained higher education diplomas, without the backing of wealthy gentlemen or even tougher backstage supporters, can't even think of entering the educational circles of Hengyang. And these few highly educated women are really too unfortunate - university diplomas and lovers are the purpose and meaning of their pursuit of knowledge, and they are the destination of their lives. They sit leisurely at home every day. The elegant ones blow and sing, chant and recite; the vulgar ones play cards, and mahjong; they can't talk about being a "good wife and loving mother," but the university diploma is like a golden signboard, enough for them to despise everything and live as parasites.</p>
<p>Almost universally, the consciousness of intellectual women in Hengyang is feudal. They have no deeper understanding of their own problems, nor do they have conscious actions. Not to mention a group that flatter their in-laws and hateful husbands, even women who have snatched marital autonomy from their parents often cry with swollen eyes behind people's backs, but do not have the courage to jump out of the established trap. There are even young widowed teachers who are neither for "love" nor for "singlehood." They shamelessly tell in the crowd, with a burst of praise following the sigh, the funny scene unfolds, like a "puppet show" being performed. - Naturally, the manipulators of this "puppet show" are not wandering performers, but man-eating "rites." "Fatalism" dominates them. Whether middle-aged women or young girls, after a violent and embarrassing entanglement of all their own sorrows, they helplessly lower their heads: "It's destined, there is no possibility of improvement!"</p>
<p>Therefore, many who were lively students or teachers ten years ago now have nothing but beds and stoves; they live in a state of depression, living like in a dream, unwilling to be seen by an old classmate, hiding as if they were dead, completely forgotten by society.</p>
<p>And the group that is active in society has never heard of a page of glorious life. Feudal threats, "fatalism" are their salvation. It can be said that after searching the entire city of Hengyang at this moment, there will not be such a woman who yearns for political suffering. In their scope of activity - schools - there is full of stagnation and lifeless depression. Pitiable are some of the students attending classes, sitting in the classroom, they are simply puppets, either listening quietly for an hour, or copying from the blackboard for an hour; there is no automatic questioning; when answering the teacher's words, the voice is timid and trembling, strangely dull. The auditorium is hung with students' compositions, drawings, and handicrafts, etc., but apart from stereotyped imitation, there are few, or even none, creative expressions. If there is a proposal for educational reform, this nosy outsider will be ridiculed: they do not avoid the frontal attack, but laugh it off, or answer: "It won't work, teacher! This place is destroyed as soon as it encounters something new, do you still want to eat? Everyone is the same, so-so. We are satisfied if we can inject some inherent knowledge into the students." This "get by" doctrine is the outlook on life and the spirit of career for intellectual women in Hengyang.</p>
<p>But their treatment is unusually pitiable! The principal of a county elementary school, working all day in a school where students have no autonomy, receives a salary of only a little more than twenty yuan; teachers are paid by the hour, with thirty or so hours per week, and piles and piles of papers are stacked on the desk, which they have to read until late at night, but they only earn around forty yuan. - However, this is a considerable amount! There are many who earn several yuan, or a dozen yuan.</p>
<p>It is simply unimaginable how they are saving in their lives; some people are still able to have surplus and buy real estate. What kind of decadent tendency is shining in their soul that is calculating painstakingly! …</p>
<p>Speaking of their entertainment, that is, pastime, few are willing to take books as their object - naturally, they have little time is also a reason. What is boring is that they learn the old tricks of licentious poets playing with women, "powdered chrysanthemum," "golden rouge," relish them with relish, fascinated, and hang them on their lips. When the daily four-page newspaper comes, they first compete to read this kind of news, and recite those frivolous poems praising the actors; when they are in the mood, they go to the theater together. In addition, there are occasional card games. Secular gifts and banquets, without exception, no matter how difficult life is, they can struggle to get up; "decency" is very important to them.</p>
<p>Vulgar, corrupt - intellectual women of Hengyang! I can't write in more detail; sympathy blocks my heart, and my pen is stiff. Recalling, the joys of childhood, the unforgettable or more or less affectionate friendships, here, friends, in a higher sense, hoping that you, who are far away from the mountains, regard this lightly sketched thing as a more advanced expression of love, a hint in a dream. I wish you a brave survival! May we have a more powerful reunion!</p>
<h3 id="e323">Eradicating Women's Jealousy <a href="#e323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Ni</p>
<p>If we acknowledge that psychological phenomena are a reflection of social phenomena, then women's jealousy is certainly created by a certain social environment. Jealousy is not only found in women, but also in men, but women express it more intensely. Needless to say, jealousy is the most unpromising and despicable psychology. This is because this psychology is almost purely based on selfish individualism, and often circles in the narrowest range or dead end, and even leads to the most base and cruel actions. However, in the final analysis, jealousy is still a product of the current social system, a concrete manifestation of the most acute and deteriorated private ownership concept. Therefore, in the current society, anything that I do not have, or that others have better than me, can arouse jealousy. "Colleagues are jealous of each other" in industry and commerce is well known. Even if people have knowledge, ability, talent, or even are born beautiful, or invent scientific and mechanical inventions, they can attract the attention of jealousy. The heavier the selfishness, the shallower the knowledge, the narrower the mind (the narrowness and breadth of the mind is partly inherited), the more intense the jealousy - this can almost become a law. Conversely, people who can see through the structure of the private ownership system, understand the relationships within it and its inevitable causal laws, have far-sighted vision and the ambition to transform society, and are determined to sacrifice themselves and strive for the common happiness of mankind, will have their jealousy reduced to the weakest position, or even completely washed away.</p>
<p>The reason why women are particularly rich in jealousy is due to women's particular history and particular social environment, and family environment. Historically, women have been thrown into a realm of multiple oppression and humiliation, and often confined to the narrowest family circle, first of all, they have cultivated a very narrow psychology, and secondly, the accumulation of various inequalities and dissatisfactions, coupled with the abundance of emotions and the lack of reason... These, combined with the concept of private ownership and flourishing, have formed a particularly active and rampant nest of jealousy. Therefore, women not only see others being more dramatic and powerful than themselves and become jealous, see others having more clothes and jewelry and become jealous, see other women being more beautiful and smart than themselves and become jealous, even the elder sister-in-law sees the second sister-in-law giving birth to a good-looking or smart child and becomes jealous. The most wonderful thing is: such as a widowed mother, seeing her son being good with his daughter-in-law and becomes jealous... In the extreme of jealousy, even the elder sister-in-law kills or maims the second sister-in-law's child, and the mother torments or kills the daughter-in-law, all kinds of cruel and base behaviors are not uncommon. Nowadays, women who have received so-called new-style education certainly have much less jealousy, but generally speaking, traditional habits are still very deep. This is enough to prove it only from the disharmony among female colleagues in agencies, schools... the mutual competition for leadership positions in groups, or the various facts of slandering each other behind their backs, but they are expressed more elegantly and smartly in form, or they are not visible. Naturally, there are also women who have escaped from that narrow and despicable jealousy because of the firm will to transform society and the heroic spirit of self-sacrifice. However, this is ultimately a minority. Since women's jealousy and people's general jealousy belong to one of the psychological phenomena, are the degradation of the concept of private ownership, and are reflections of social phenomena, then we cannot simply curse this evil root of humanity like moralists or religious figures! Jealousy, but we should understand that this "evil root" is only the inevitable result reflected under this certain social system. To eradicate this "evil root," we must of course start from fundamentally transforming society. However, from an individual point of view, especially from a woman's point of view, we should also subjectively learn the despicableness of jealousy, and we should recognize that jealousy is the demon that destroys our female unity, and is a major obstacle in the course of the women's liberation movement. We must eradicate it from the root.</p>
<h3 id="e324">Quan Jie Tang <a href="#e324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Qidong</p>
<p>— One of the Travelogue to Songjiang —</p>
<p>One door after another door, tightly locking the young woman's youth, this feudal ancient palace, Quan Jie Tang!</p>
<p>When we walked to the last two major doors, everyone felt gloomy and lifeless. Each major door was added with a large lock, and in addition to the large lock, a guard was added.</p>
<p>Because it was New Year's Day, there were especially many children in Quan Jie Tang. These children were raised by the widows in the past. Now, some are studying in school and come back at night, and some are playing there all day long. Their board and lodging are borne by the Quan Jie Tang, and the boys must leave there when they reach the age of thirteen.</p>
<p>The air in the courtyard is very silent. Not to mention that it seems to them that there is no change, even to us, these few desolate small trees seem to be surviving forever without seasons, surviving!</p>
<p>Opposite the courtyard are rows of rural-style houses, one floor and one bottom, which are the bedrooms of the widows, the detention centers of sex. The upstairs and downstairs are the same size, about two zhang wide and long. It is said that two families live in each room.</p>
<p>A woman of sixteen or seventeen years old was sitting by the upstairs window, observing. No, to be more precise, she was gazing, gazing at this group of uninvited travelers, gazing at the changing clouds in the sky. She seemed to be thinking about something, half-covering the wooden window, shaking her head lightly in disappointment. She was recalling, or she was thinking about her future destiny!</p>
<p>"How many people are there here?" I asked an old woman near me. She was forty or fifty years old. She was sewing a man's long trousers stitch by stitch. She stopped her needle and answered timidly:</p>
<p>"A lot!"</p>
<p>"Can people of all ages come in?"</p>
<p>"No, no, people over thirty cannot enter the hall!"</p>
<p>"Then what about you?"</p>
<p>"Me," she laughed, "I entered the hall when I was young. Which of these old women didn't enter the hall when they were young!"</p>
<p>With that, she continued to sew the clothes. Her face suddenly became gloomy, probably because she felt the difficulty and uselessness of the process from being a young widow to being an old widow.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, I greedily asked her again:</p>
<p>"How many meals do you eat here a day?"</p>
<p>"Three meals."</p>
<p>"How many bowls of vegetables?"</p>
<p>"Two people only have one bowl of vegetables."</p>
<p>"Is it meat or vegetarian?"</p>
<p>"Usually it's vegetarian. There are two big meat meals and four small meat meals every ten days. But there are also extra dishes for festivals."</p>
<p>"Can you go back?"</p>
<p>"No, we can only go back once during the Qingming Festival to sweep the tombs."</p>
<p>"Who takes care of your clothes and the children's clothes?"</p>
<p>"It's all our own."</p>
<p>"Where do you get the money?"</p>
<p>"Some is sent from home, and some is earned by doing work."</p>
<p>"Is the pay for doing work big?"</p>
<p>"How can it be big, it's always several times less than usual."</p>
<p>Because we were going to visit other places again, I asked her the last question:</p>
<p>"What is your hope in life?"</p>
<p>"In the children!"</p>
<p>She answered in a startled and hesitant way. But soon, she seemed to deny herself, shaking her head in frustration. She stopped talking.</p>
<p>On the way back, our companions were all satisfied, occasionally talking about: "It's a pity that time is too hasty, we can't visit in more detail."</p>
<p>"We are very lucky to be able to see this secret of mankind."</p>
<p>"This is a mirror, reflecting the fate of women, reflecting how a woman's life ends up!"</p>
<h3 id="e325">The Tragedy of Xing Meimei <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— Lian Rui</p>
<p>A few days ago, I received a letter from my sister, knowing that Xing Meimei, from the family of my uncle, has gone to her husband's house to guard the door as a widow. The Zhang family is wealthy, and Xing Meimei's living expenses are naturally not a problem, but it is very pitiful to be a widow at the age of seventeen. Moreover, since her mother-in-law wanted to retain the right to manage the family property, she would have persuaded my aunt to trick Xing Meimei into performing the tragedy of marrying a spirit tablet in the past, how can it be guaranteed that it was not her mother-in-law who persuaded her to say that "she is willing to remain a widow for life" now? How can a lively girl fall in love by looking at a fiancé lying on a coffin board, and be willing to remain a widow for him? Xing Meimei is very naive. At such a young age, she must not know how to use any tricks. It must be her mother-in-law's sweet words that moved her heart, so she said it was her own will, right?</p>
<p>"My aunt is really confused, and she is still hoping that the President will award her a chaste widow's memorial tablet. She is ruining her daughter's lifelong happiness in exchange for a chaste widow's memorial tablet?" This is the conclusion in my sister's letter. After reading the letter, I was stunned for five or six days. Xing Meimei graduated from junior high school last summer vacation. Could it be that even this bit of life knowledge was not given to her by the so-called school education? I can hardly believe this is true.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, before the May Fourth Movement, my alma mater also had such an incident. The classmate who was tricked was the most beautiful girl in the whole school. Because there was no custom of electing school flowers or school queens at that time, everyone just secretly envied her in their hearts and did not give her any glorious titles. The main culprit who tricked her was her elder sister, because she wanted to adopt her son to her so as to obtain that rich inheritance. As a result, several years later, the virgin who originally wanted to be a chaste widow, because she could not bear the loneliness of widowhood, changed into a concubine of a certain warlord. The stubborn father actually published a notice in the newspaper to sever his relationship with her as a father and daughter. But that was after all more than ten years ago, how can I believe that there will be a victim of "waiting for a spirit at the door" more than ten years later? But although I don't believe it, the fact is still a fact! This makes me deeply suspicious of the current women's education.</p>
<p>"Second cousin Ai Jian, last year I escaped to Hangzhou to work because I didn't want to marry a consumptive ghost. In September, I was expelled for going on strike with others. After returning home, my father said that his consumption had been cured and asked me to go over. I believed it was true. My brother and sister-in-law wouldn't let me eat. I got married, worshipped heaven and earth, and was sent into the bridal chamber. I learned that he didn't even have the strength to worship the hall, so I cried and refused to share a bed. My mother-in-law said good things and begged me to do good deeds and leave a piece of flesh and blood for her son, a lifeline. I don't want to harm myself. I sleep in the same bed with the young maid every night. My father is ruthless and cannot discuss it with him. My brother came back for the New Year. I borrowed a few dollars from him and wanted to escape to Shanghai to work. I am willing to do any kind of rough work, it is better to be a widow. Please ask my aunt for me, I am afraid that her factory needs odd jobs. I want to be a widow and not do it. It is better to make my own living and be happy. Do you think it's right, I wish you</p>
<p>Happiness. Cousin Ai Lian's hand"</p>
<p>I read Lianmei's letter to me a year ago again and again, and the more I read it, the more suspicious I became. Why is it that a cousin who has only read for three and a half years in elementary school is more knowledgeable than a cousin who graduated from junior high school? Is it getting more and more confused the more you read?</p>
<p>I think, if it is not because of different school education, it must be because my second uncle, Lianmei's father, is a farmer, and my uncle is a teacher, and has taught Xing Meimei to read more ancient books since she was a child. Poor Xing Meimei, I don't know when she will be able to learn and understand? Whenever I think of her tragic marriage to a spirit tablet, my heart contracts so tightly that it is as uncomfortable as if I can't breathe.</p>
<h3 id="e326">Women and Literature <a href="#e326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Zijin</p>
<p>(1) Women Reflected in Ancient Literature</p>
<p>(2) Ibsen, the Discoverer of the Female Soul</p>
<p>(3) Women After Ibsen</p>
<p>(4) Women of the Future</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Literature is a mirror reflecting social life and a signal calling for the improvement of human life. Writers use their ingenious pens to reflect social life and expose all aspects of society. At the same time, they suggest new problems that the public has not yet recognized, drawing people's attention and understanding.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the lives of half of humanity, women, have left traces that we can find in literature. We can search literature for the discovery of female personality and soul, and the fresh accounts of women awakening and rising to improve their lives. From the image of women reflected in literature, we can clearly see the journey women have taken over thousands of years.</p>
<p>The women depicted in ancient literature are all pathetic creatures without independent personalities or souls. They are either playthings or slaves. The Yuefu "Midnight Song" says:</p>
<p>"Her wrist extends upon her lover's knee, what place is not pitiable?" This explains that the purpose of women is simply to make men feel "pitiable."</p>
<p>Consider another ancient poem:</p>
<p>"I go up the mountain to gather weeds, and down the mountain, I meet my former husband; I kneel and ask my former husband, how is the new bride?" It tells of a woman who was abandoned by her husband and suffered much pain. Later, she went up the mountain to gather wild vegetables, and on her way back, she encountered that heartless husband. She even knelt down and asked her husband, "Is the new bride well?" The husband replied, "The new bride is not as beautiful as you, nor as fast at weaving."</p>
<p>From this poem, we can see that the abandoned woman not only does not dare to resent, but when she meets her husband, she kneels down and asks about the new bride. This is simply not treating herself as a human being. The husband's reply only says that she is not as beautiful or as fast at weaving. Isn't this clearly treating women as slaves?</p>
<p>Cui Yingying in "Romance of the West Chamber" is also simply a complete plaything. She is dedicated from head to toe, from body to soul, to the lustful Zhang Sheng.</p>
<p>Although Lin Daiyu in "Dream of the Red Chamber" is written as very clever and self-respecting, she makes people feel pity for her everywhere. So melancholic and painful, so frail, she can be said to be the representative and typical of old-fashioned women. She lacks any independent spirit. Once she loses the protection or play of men, she cannot survive.</p>
<p>We can also see the same soulless and independently-personality women of the old era in Western literature. In the novels of Turgenev and Chekhov, we can recognize many charming and sensual women. From the novels of Zola and Maupassant, we can see many gentle and obedient slaves. In Tolstoy's novels, there is Anna Karenina, who is a slave to fate. In Thomas Hardy's novels, we can see Tess, who can never escape the clutches of a villain.</p>
<p>Women of the past, as the Bible says, "are a rib from man," attached to men, without soul or personality. It can be seen that whether in China or abroad, women in savage times were equally unfortunate, equally serving as slaves or playthings of another kind of people. They carefully flattered their masters, serving them diligently. Or they deliberately feigned coyness and obedience, without anyone's pity. The husbands, however, did whatever they wanted and acted tyrannically for a while. Or they used some clever skills and sweet names to anesthetize women, causing them to fall without realizing it. Thus, women lived their lives in a dark and sunless underground.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Women are not born slaves or playthings. They originally had beautiful souls and independent personalities. However, they were submerged by long-term oppression and traditional thoughts and habits, intoxicated by ingenious tricks and skills, and the occasional depression was flattened in their own bitter cries. So they became soulless animals. This inhuman life of theirs went through a long period until the great writer Ibsen was born.</p>
<p>Ibsen's problem play "A Doll's House," everyone knows, is a wake-up call for women, a signal to awaken women. It awakened women from their millennia-long dreams, and fully exposed the cold, tyrannical exterior and interior of men. He uncovered the hypocrisy of all the sins and deceptions that men have always asked of them, allowing women to recognize them. Thus, the soul of women, which had never been noticed and which women themselves had forgotten, was suddenly discovered and awakened by this great writer. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e327">What Books Should Young People Read? <a href="#e327" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c327" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">327</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Mingyi</p>
<p>The purpose of reading is to gain knowledge. Books are a tool, and people must be able to use and control them to get the most out of them. For example, a carpenter must choose sharp chisels, axes, etc., to help him with his work. It is essential to carefully select books to read.</p>
<p>Some time ago, Mr. Liang Qichao published his "Must-Read List of Books for National Studies." In October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the "Dawan Bao" newspaper sought "Books I Would Like to Introduce to Young People," and many people responded. Mr. Shi Zhicun recommended the books "Zhuangzi" and "Selections of Refined Literature" to young people. This caused a heated debate.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not easy to make a definitive statement about the answer to "What Books Should Young People Read?" I think that rather than listing a bunch of wild book titles, it would be better for everyone to study and come up with several "principles for selecting books to read," so that ambitious young people can find suitable books based on these principles.</p>
<p>Based on our daily life, the books we should read can be roughly divided into three aspects: (1) those related to personal cultivation, (2) those related to professional knowledge, and (3) those related to leisure education.</p>
<p>Young people are in a period of personal transformation, and it is necessary to cultivate personal life and career at any time. Although we do not need to worship idols, we can seek from the famous people of the past the special qualities that made them famous. Reading books on cultivation can give us an opportunity for reflection and be the basis for changing our temperament.</p>
<p>The knowledge gained in school is mostly general education knowledge. Although university courses have more specialized research, in reality, because they are not yet related to real business, the knowledge gained may not be useful for business. A person who leaves school will feel his lack of knowledge. Many practical knowledge feels insufficient. Why is this? Originally, the knowledge gained before was empty. Now, when it comes into contact with real life, it is discovered that what was learned emptily before may not be practical or may not have been noticed at the time. Therefore, to seek the improvement of business, it is necessary to obtain knowledge related to business.</p>
<p>Books for appreciation should not be discarded either. It is like eating rice and definitely needing to drink water. People's lives must not only be a monotonous life of material and numbers but also a happy and beautiful life of the spirit. Literature and art can make up for the shortcomings of life. They express a more genuine life, which is enough to enable us to understand a more meaningful life. Although literature and art cannot make material contributions and inventions like science, they have fulfilled the responsibility of cultivating people's emotions and comforting people's souls. Therefore, when you have spare time every day after work, appreciating these kinds of books is the best form of leisure education.</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said: "My life has a limit, but knowledge has no limit." Since we cannot completely consume the limited time of our lives in the endless pile of books, then how can we not find the books we need from the vast sea of books?</p>
<p>Hobbes once said to people: "If I also read as many books as others, I am afraid I will also be as ignorant as others." He is not telling people not to read, but he is telling people not to read indiscriminately, that is to say, reading should be done with careful selection.</p>

<h3 id="e328">"Tin Bucket" <a href="#e328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Fushan</p>
<p>What a tin bucket is, I don't need to explain. Look, which household doesn't use a tin bucket? It's really a thing that's so common that there's nothing more to say. How did I get involved with tin buckets? It's a long story. It was in the countryside. Last year, there was a severe drought, and people who had no way to survive heard that it was easy to live in Shanghai, so they all ran to Shanghai. I was one of these famine refugees.</p>
<p>Naturally, standing on the street or pacing back and forth looking at people's faces is not a long-term solution. Therefore, the idea of finding a job came to my mind. Poor relatives also thought I was very smart and spent a lot of effort to ask people to help me get a position as an apprentice in a tin bucket shop. The conditions were: follow the master to work, have food to eat, and get twenty copper coins a month for barber fees. This was only because relatives and friends pleaded in many ways, and the tin bucket boss thought he was doing a good deed before he was willing to take me in.</p>
<p>At first, the boss taught me to hammer the cut tin sheets into a circle with a wooden square. I learned it in less than a few minutes. After a week, he taught me to cut tin sheets. As long as you know how to hold scissors and draw lines on tin sheets, what's so difficult about that! Later, after about a month, he taught me "rolling the edges" and "knocking the bottom." As for "soldering," he never wanted to teach me. I knew he was being sneaky. He was afraid that if I learned it, I would run away. I was really angry. Isn't it easy to learn to make a tin bucket? I learned it all in less than half an hour. I even graduated from a higher elementary school before! One day, the master was not at home, so I secretly made a complete one. I even soldered it, and it didn't leak. It was the same as the master's. I was so happy! Do you know what the master did when he found out later? He cursed, "Damn it! You're very clever!" He looked very impatient and, that night, using an excuse, he gave me a good beating.</p>
<p>In the first few days of entering the shop, I was very happy, but later it was different. The time for making tin buckets is not much, probably seven or eight hours a day, or five or six hours. There are also times when we have to rush to work at night. Then we have to be busy all day and night, until two or three o'clock at night before we can sleep. We call these days "ghosting." When we are not "ghosting," we are just as busy. There are always many things to do. However, we can go to sleep a little earlier. We go to bed at 10:30 at night and have to get up before 6:00 the next morning to empty the chamber pots, sweep the floor, and open the shop door. After working for an hour, we have to make a fire to boil water for the boss and his wife to wash their faces. When I come back from buying vegetables, I also have to start making breakfast. In short, all day long, besides working and cooking, I am holding the child. Although I am still a child myself, I always like children, but I hate the boss's child very much. He is really spoiled. He is more than three years old and still wants people to hold him all day long. He has to eat whatever he wants. If he cries when he is unhappy, the boss's wife will definitely slap me a few times on the face. There is another person in the shop who is suffering like me. He is also fifteen years old and the same "old hand" as me. We two are very close</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, and we discuss everything before doing it. Their calculations are really shrewd. They won't let me and him go to buy groceries together. They always don't want anyone to be idle.</p>
<p>Probably because I rushed to work at night and got caught in the rain while buying groceries, my "old hand" got sick. At first, they didn't say anything. On the third day, they said, "He's been sick for a long time and is still not getting better. He sleeps and eats and still needs someone to serve him. Tell him to get out!" I was really sad when I heard these words. I thought that we were making "tin buckets," and we were really like a "tin bucket." If a "tin bucket" is rusty and has a hole in it, it will always be thrown aside, and no one will pay attention to it!</p>
<h3 id="e329">After Watching "Peach and Plum Tribulation" <a href="#e329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>— Qingyin</p>
<p>"Peach and Plum Tribulation" can be considered a rather excellent harvest on the film scene recently. This is not only because it has considerable achievements in technology but also because it touches on realistic issues in its content. The fact that this play can move the audience and earn people's tears is not accidental and has its extraordinary qualities.</p>
<p>First of all, we cannot forget the efforts of the stage performers here and the rarity of their achievements. The performance feature of this play is the grand gathering of stage performers making their debut on the silver screen. In fact, from the screenwriter and director to the actors, the stage performers did their jobs and did not ruin their stage. Originally, there is no essential difference between stage acting and silver screen acting. The training and cultivation gained from the stage can also help an actor succeed on the silver screen. The achievements of "Peach and Plum Tribulation" happen to illustrate this fact. The instability of the acting skills of the main actors in "Peach and Plum Tribulation" and the fullness of the emotional process are all gifts from the stage. Although there are not a few places in the performance that are excessive and exaggerated, this may be a small flaw, but in reality, this kind of scene can sometimes obtain unexpected effects. This can be found in "Peach and Plum Tribulation." In many European and American films adapted from stage plays, especially in the famous film "Twentieth Century Express," it is also easy to find this kind of place.</p>
<p>In terms of screenwriting technique, what is worth mentioning is the use of flashbacks and the placement of songs. Starting with the old principal visiting the prison and allowing the story to unfold in the narrative of memories, it appears more tortuous and tasteful than a straightforward narrative and does not fall into mediocrity. The "Graduation Song" is sung during the graduation ceremony only as a necessary part of the story's progress, but when sung in the memory scene of the male protagonist committing a crime and about to be executed, it evokes people's feelings about the fact of "graduation is unemployment." This not only increased the tragic atmosphere of the play but also naturally engraved a painful and profound impression on the audience's eardrums due to the loud voice.</p>
<p>The director is competent. Because this is the first time directing for the silver screen, there are inevitably some shortcomings, such as not grasping the personality of the characters, especially Tao Jianping's personality, clearly enough, and the emotional process sometimes seeming a little too fast, but these are all minor flaws. Isn't he also showing a lot of ability in psychological descriptions and atmosphere?</p>
<p>Finally, what cannot be left unsaid is the not-so-healthy content represented by this play. We cannot deny that the playwright saw reality in his selection of materials, but unfortunately, he did not reasonably explain and reflect this reality. He only saw the surface of reality and did not fundamentally explore the essence of reality. The fact that "graduation is unemployment" is only explained as an accidental phenomenon; it is only because the protagonist Tao Jianping thinks too highly of himself and is unwilling to be patient that he incurs the tragedy and misfortune of unemployment. Assuming that he is able to "be patient," the tide of unemployment will not sweep over him. Isn't this just a fool's dream? In the current social system, it is difficult to allow people to be so optimistic. Assuming that all college and university students can find positions in shipping companies, architects, or labor jobs like Tao Jianping, then the phrase "graduation is unemployment" would be nothing more than a laughable lie. But unfortunately, this phrase accurately represents a serious fact that is difficult to change. This point just illustrates the superficiality of the playwright's understanding of society. But film art should not stay on this superficial level. It should explore the inner layers of things, elucidate the inner nature of things, and indicate the direction of the development of things. Otherwise, some discounts must be given in the evaluation of the entire work. I think "Peach and Plum Tribulation" should be given these discounts because some of its technical achievements are not the achievements of the entire work. — Although it is still a film worth recommending and worth watching.</p>

<h3 id="e330">An Analysis of the Franco-Italian Agreement <a href="#e330" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c330" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">330</a></h3>
<p>— Shaomen</p>
<p>After the Great War, the expression of Franco-Italian conflict was almost no less severe than the contradiction between Germany and France. Whether in the Mediterranean, in North Africa, in Central Europe, or in the Balkans, the conflict between France and Italy was clearly expressed. After the Marseilles incident, Yugoslavia, one of France's three satellites, expressed its hatred more clearly and specifically. At the same time, Mussolini did not show weakness and adopted a tough policy towards the South. For a time, the European situation became serious again, with a tendency to have another war. However, before the traces of blood shed by this tragedy had dried, the news that French Foreign Minister Laval had arrived in Rome was spread. Immediately, newspapers all over the world published the news of the signing of the Franco-Italian agreement, "a new page in European history after the European War." At the same time, Yugoslavia, which had harbored hatred, also expressed its attitude of maintaining this agreement together with Romania and Czechoslovakia. This situation is, of course, bound to cause surprise.</p>
<p>Originally, as a result of the European War, France used the Treaty of Versailles to suppress the Germans and dominate Europe, and strongly advocated maintaining the post-war status quo. Not only did Germany desperately oppose this, but Italy also formed the idea of amending the treaty because the status quo created by this treaty was unfavorable to it. However, after Hitler came to power, on the one hand, he greatly threatened France because of his high-profile call for rearmament and the abolition of the treaty. On the other hand, he actively carried out the merger of Austria, which made Italy feel deeply uneasy. In this situation, in order to maintain its post-war spoils of victory, France worked hard to ease the conflict between France and Italy in order to stop Germany's attempt to break the contract. As for Italy, it also wanted to maintain its existing position and development path in Central Europe and did not want the merger of Germany and Austria to become a reality. For a time, it also wanted to unite France to deal with the Germans. Although the contradictions between France and Italy are very complex and sharp, they are constantly trying to conditionally ease their contradictions to seek temporary compromise on a certain shared interest. The Franco-Italian agreement recently signed in Rome is a manifestation of the fact that France and Italy, under the unstable trend of Germany's foreign policy, are mutually easing their contradictions and seeking temporary compromises with various conditions.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Franco-Italian agreement is divided into four parts, and the main content is as follows:</p>
<p>1. France agrees to cede 114,000 square kilometers of land south of Italian Libya to Libya; and to cede the coastline opposite the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait under the jurisdiction of French Somaliland to Italian Eritrea. ...</p>
<p>2. Italy may participate in the operation of the railway from French Djibouti to Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>3. France and Italy jointly propose that all neighboring countries of Austria and Austria should mutually conclude an agreement of non-interference and non-aggression. France, Poland, and Romania may also join the agreement, so that when the territorial integrity of Austria is threatened, all countries may hold consultations with Austria. ...</p>
<p>4. Regarding the issue of equality of armament rights, the French and Italian governments, based on the declaration of the five powers of Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy on December 11, 1932, jointly recognize that no country</p>
<h3 id="e331">After Seeing the Performance of the Leng Yan Dance Troupe <a href="#e331" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c331" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">331</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Yao</p>
<p>After touring several ports like Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao, the Leng Yan Dance Troupe has now arrived in Shanghai. They have already performed in several cinemas, including the Southeast, Huade, and Empire. Their performance this time represents another trend in the dance world, which is that they do not appeal to the audience with sensuality, but devote all their efforts to the technical aspects of the dance itself. This is a noteworthy point.</p>
<p>Speaking of technique, there is much to mention in terms of singing, dancing, and music. Miss Louise, the former leading figure of the "Xiaying" Dance Troupe and now a key member of Leng Yan, is gifted with a beautiful voice, and her "solo" is enough to attract attention. In terms of dance, the troupe hired a Russian dance teacher in Tianjin for a long period of instruction, so their performances can be described as skilled, and the dance postures also have a foreign flavor. Programs such as "Cossack Dance," "Russian Court Dance," "Tango," "Gypsy Dance," "French Dance," etc., mostly represent a national character and also have a kind of healthy and powerful dance posture, which are quite eye-catching. In terms of music, the troupe's orchestra is relatively well-organized, and the seven members are mostly well-versed in music, so the results are no less than those of Shanghai's dance troupes. In addition, the drama "By Hook or by Crook" (this play has been performed many times in Shanghai), starring Ms. Liu Mang and Louise from the troupe, although the scenery is inevitably a bit simple, the acting skills of the two are quite remarkable. As for the outdated content of this play, that is another matter, and I will not discuss it here.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say something about my hopes for the troupe. The troupe has already seen the need to change the trend of song and dance, but I am afraid that they have not paid enough attention to the need for new creations in song and dance. Imitating others is never enough. They should have artistic, audience-pleasing, healthy and powerful new creations in order to meet the needs of the vast audience. Otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve success in business, and it will also be difficult to have any performance in the development of song and dance art itself. I wonder if the gentlemen of the troupe agree with my humble opinion?</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Unilaterally changing the obligations regarding armaments; regarding this issue, when necessary, the two governments may consult with each other.</p>
<p>This clearly shows that: on the one hand, France ceded some land and rights in African colonies to Italy, to satisfy its eagerness to expand its African colonies to a considerable extent; at the same time, France and its satellite Little Entente countries jointly guaranteed Austria's independence and prevented the German-Austrian merger, in order to maintain its access to the Balkans through Austria; on the other hand, Italy did not harass Yugoslavia, did not harm France's interests in the Balkans, and jointly maintained Austria's independence and European peace with France and the Little Entente (that is, jointly maintained the status quo in Europe), in order to protect some of the effects of the Treaty of Versailles, which had long been torn up, so that the benefits France gained in the Great War could be preserved. - The so-called Franco-Italian agreement was established under such conditions. Its primary function, of course, was to ease the conflict between France and Italy and to jointly monitor Germany on a certain point.</p>
<p>However, post-war Germany had to find a way out. In the meantime, Germany had only two paths to take: one was to realize the German-Austrian merger and compete with France and Italy to gain access to the Balkans; the other was to head north to the Baltic Sea and invade the Soviet Union to the east. But recent facts have shown that the former path is greatly hindered and not easy to follow, forcing it to shift its gaze entirely to the east and take the latter path. For example, Germany's befriending of Poland, Hitler's deletion of anti-French phrases from his autobiography, the repeated publication of "peace" speeches by National Socialists, and the reunion of German and French veterans are all obvious examples of this German tendency. What about France? Naturally, it wants to guarantee its own "security" and prevent Germany from rising up to take revenge, but if Germany really does not take the westward route and goes straight to the east, it will also agree. The problem here is that France cannot believe that Germany has really abandoned its revengeful intentions and will not attack Paris. If it can get the support of Italy and even Britain in Europe to jointly monitor Germany's implementation of its eastward policy, then French imperialism can hide from its enemies with powerful help and make them fight with others. What's wrong with that for it? Originally, France's approach to Germany was nothing more than one of these two: before Germany recovered its vitality, it would launch a defensive war against Germany to prevent it from rising again; it hoped that Germany would move east and avoid direct conflict between Germany and France. But the former is very dangerous because it cannot get the support of Britain and Italy; the latter is easier to get the support and guarantee of Britain and Italy, but it is very "safe". Therefore, as long as possible, France will of course adopt the latter policy. The recently signed Franco-Italian agreement, in addition to being used by France and Italy to monitor Germany and prevent it from harming their interests, also has the implication of making Germany's outward path from west to east: this is of course the result of British and French diplomatic policy. The Soviet Union's "Izvestia" newspaper agreed with the British newspaper's analysis of this issue, saying: "The Rome talks, as the British newspaper said, will be an expression of creating some favorable conditions for building a bridge between Germany and France. British diplomats are working in this direction. This is nothing more than obtaining an appropriate level of rhetoric and documents from the German side and allowing Germany's legal right to expand its military." Although there are no provisions in the published Franco-Italian agreement to allow Germany to rearm, we believe that France, Italy and even Britain must have concrete discussions on this issue. For example, British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to France before the event, Britain's expression of joy afterwards, the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's visit to London, Laval's plan to visit Berlin, France's recent indifference to the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, the British openly advocating the abolition of military clauses in the peace treaty, the "resurrection" of the dead disarmament conference, the widespread rumors of Germany's return to disarmament in Europe and the United States... - All of these reveal another function of the Rome Agreement: "to create some favorable conditions for building a bridge between France and Germany", "to allow Germany's legal right to expand its military", so that it can move east.</p>
<p>However, long nights are fraught with dreams, and whether the development of all events is as planned by the European powers is still a question worth studying.</p>

<h3 id="e332">Reality and Hope <a href="#e332" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c332" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">332</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Peng</p>
<p>Hope and reality are the two vitalities of human survival. No matter how reality makes you unfulfilled, makes you bored, and disappointed, you still cannot suddenly leave it, no matter how bad it is. Because people are already living in reality, there is absolutely no reason to live completely without reality. Reality is something that humans cannot get rid of. Wearing clothes, eating, living in houses, making friends, having sex, doing what you are doing and want to do, and saying what you are saying and want to say are all reality. Everyone lives in this reality, and everyone's life is expressed as their own personal reality. Without reality, there is no life.</p>
<p>Although reality is the content of every person's life and the conditions of life, the reality of any era and any individual will make him unable to be satisfied, so he cannot but have another kind of hope as the driving force of life. Otherwise, not only will mankind not be able to progress, but even the existing reality will not be able to be maintained, and life will not be able to continue. Because no matter whether a person's hope can become a reality in the future, he always needs to have a hope to succeed, and he already has a hope. A person who has the highest power, even if he has climbed to the highest spire of the pyramid-shaped organization of human society, still has his future hopes. Therefore, ancient emperors such as Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty still hoped to live forever and sent people to the sea or built terraces to seek immortals. Other holders of the highest power hope that they can permanently maintain their position without being shaken. Merchants certainly hope to recover their capital after losing money, and even those who have made money hope to make more money. Workers hope to get a raise tomorrow and have more income in a month. Farmers hope that next year's harvest will be better than this year's. People who write articles hope that the稿費 is higher and that every article can be sold. Women who find a husband also hope to give birth to a son early, marry a daughter-in-law, and have grandchildren. In short, a lot of future life aspirations become everyone's hopes and fantasies, and linger in their minds, forming a part of their lives and lives. Hope, simply put, is mankind's desire to comfort itself and make up for the shortcomings of reality in the midst of dissatisfaction with reality. When people have a hope, they can comfort themselves and continue to live. Hope is looking forward to the future, but it increases mankind's fighting spirit and courage. Mankind must have hope, must have the future aspirations that lure him, and then he can move forward. Mankind's progress is here, and the burning and driving force of life are also here. If mankind had no hope, I am afraid that he would have stayed in primitive society and would not have been able to move forward. If an individual does not have a hope to burn his heart and become a disappointed person, then he will definitely come to the future of suicide!</p>
<p>From this point of view, hope and reality are contradictory and harmonious. Because without reality, you would have already ceased to exist, so where would there be any hope? Without hope, you cannot live to enjoy reality and continue to create reality, and all existing and future realities will disappear in your disappointment. And on the one hand, only reality gives you experience, so that you can feel satisfied or disgusted, and thus have hope. On the other hand, only hope can make you create continuous reality and create it as your reality in the continuation of life. However, reality and hope are also contradictory. Because without dissatisfaction with reality, you would not have hope and move towards the future that you grasp, which means that you abandon reality. Conversely, if you are content with the satisfaction of reality and grasp it and are unwilling to give it up, it means that you have no other hope and have abandoned the future. In other words, you are completely standing on reality and are unwilling to leave it even one step, so there is no need for hope, hope disappears, and reality negates hope in this way. Just like completely fantasizing about the hope of the future, or simply not talking about reality, then you have no content of life and no possibility of survival, reality disappears, and hope also negates reality in this way. Reality wants you to stay in its arms and does not allow you to leave, but hope wants you to leave reality and run forward with it, so they contradict and negate each other in this way. Because of this, a proper life is often stepping on two boats: you must grasp reality and also establish hope and pursue the future. The harmony of reality and hope is in maintaining your life, and the contradiction of reality and hope is also in creating your life. People live in contradiction, contradiction is the stream of life, and it is also the torch that guides life.</p>
<p>However, there are two strange people in the world: one kind of people specializes in teaching people to be content with reality, saying that you should not be dissatisfied with reality and oppose it, your hope is a fantasy, do not leave reality and tend to fantasy, you should abandon hope, abandon fantasy and completely obey the arrangements of reality. Reality tells you how to live, and you should live like that, even if you suffer deeply in reality, you must live like this, and resisting reality is a sin. But they do not know that without dissatisfaction, boredom, resistance, and abandonment of real life, you will not be able to yearn for the future and have hope, and use it as your driving force. In this way, mankind will not evolve, and individuals will become passive or even commit suicide due to disappointment. There is also a kind of person who specializes in teaching people to hope for the future, especially religious people. They say that reality is indeed painful, but you should completely forget the pain of reality, endure the teasing of reality, and hope for future compensation. This is completely taking the hope of the future as a hypnotic, a way to hypnotize patients to make them forget the pain of disease, and this method also does not allow people to oppose reality. They do not know that completely ignoring reality and hoping for the future is to make people immediately lose the basis of survival, and after making people lose the foothold of reality, they cannot create the future and achieve hope. Obviously, for example, eating and wearing clothes are reality. If there is no food to eat and no clothes to wear, people will starve to death and freeze to death. What future can there be to hope for?</p>
<p>In short, mankind does not only live in the present, nor is the present life the perfect end. He also has to live in the future, live in a more perfect life. Therefore, he should live in reality, and he should also live in hope. You must be dissatisfied with reality to have hope, and you must be able to live in reality to create the future and realize your hope. You must have reality and also the hope of the future, you must resist reality and also not specialize in fantasizing about the future. This may seem contradictory, but this contradiction is the law of human life and also the law of human historical evolution.</p>

<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, the form of poetry has been liberated, but what has been achieved other than the early hastily written articles?</p>
<p>Our poetry world is extremely silent. When we only look back at those majestic poems originating in Northern Europe, the warm songs of Western Europe, and the delicate and蕴藉诽句 of the island country, we cannot help but feel sad about the decline and depravity of our national spirit. Poetry is the voice of the soul of a nation. It will shout out the emotions of the masses' suffering, and it will praise the unique spirit of a nation. However, our poetry world is so silent that there is almost no movement.</p>
<p>China is a land not suitable for cultural workers to grow. Just look at the thinness and even abuse of the society towards intellectuals in recent years, and you can already understand this tragic fact. The poet Zhu Xiang committed suicide by throwing himself into the river, and Peng Jiahuan passed away in days of poverty and illness. The general decline in cultural standards, the general weakness of readers' purchasing power, and the publishing industry have also been flooded with the angry tide of depression since 1933. New books are estimated at one yuan for three pounds, and articles are priced at one yuan per thousand words; when a poet is born in this era, who will care about his lines of poetry? The silence of the poetry world is one reason.</p>

<h3 id="e334">Playing with Lanterns <a href="#e334" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c334" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">334</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Ren</p>
<p>In Guizhou, during the New Year, the happiest, most lively and most interesting thing is probably "playing with lanterns." There are several kinds of lanterns, such as "dragon lanterns," "lion lanterns," "flower lanterns," "cart lanterns," and so on. This is almost enthusiastically held in any county or village in Guizhou. There are two meanings to "playing with lanterns": one is to celebrate the New Year and join in the fun, and the other is that these "lanterns" each represent a god, and the responsibility of these gods is to "keep the streets clean and protect the peace of the four seas."</p>
<p>Playing with "dragon lanterns" is an extremely grand ritual. The dragon is shaped with bamboo strips, pasted with paper, and then painted with the colorful stripes that the so-called dragon should have. The dragon coat is made of cloth, and the body is twelve or fifteen sections long. The dragon comes out from the ninth to the fifteenth day of the New Year. In front of the dragon, there are several rows of lanterns, tied into strange shapes of shrimp soldiers, crab generals, and aquatic creatures, and there are also eight immortals tied up separately. Then, amid the sound of gongs and drums, the "dragon lantern" appears. Playing with the dragon is playing with "fireworks." You only see the "dragon lantern" rolling in the flames, and the "fireworks" also have many tricks. Some of them are released in blue, some in white, and some in red. When people make "fireworks," they either put a layer of paper in the middle to make them suddenly interrupt when they are released with full force, or they put a little "tide nao" in the gunpowder to make them make a loud roar when they are released, almost like they are about to explode. Under these many embellishments, the "dragon" of the "dragon lantern" really seems to appear vividly, with the ambition to travel thousands of miles. The audience is blocked on the way, and often causes many disputes because the "dragon handle" hurts people.</p>
<p>"Playing with lions" is in the daytime, and you can see it as early as the second day of the New Year. Playing with "ground lions" is nothing, but just performing all the living habits of the lion. But the "stage lion" is really amazing. "Crossing the corner" and "passing through the stage" are not uncommon. What makes people shudder the most is climbing a high platform made of forty-one or seventy-one benches, and still doing many plays on it, and the stage is trembling and almost about to fall down. You can play up from below, and you can play down from above. In addition to the lion, there is also a "smiling arhat" and a "Sun Wukong." It is the responsibility of "Sun Wukong" to dismantle the benches one by one at the top, and he always has to do a somersault or lift a tripod on each bench. Oh, I forgot to tell you how the lion is made. The lion's head is made of cardboard, with nine colors and bells on its head, and the mouth is movable. The body is made of cloth cut into a round, arc-shaped shape and connected to the head. Two people put on the lion's mask, one playing the head and the other playing the tail. Human feet are equal to the four feet of the lion. Here I have to praise my several "old cousins." Their playing is purely skilled. If you are building a new house and want a lion to step on the beam, they can put on spiked shoes (extremely slippery on wood and very heavy) and roll, turn, and turn their heads on the beam without showing any flaws.</p>
<p>"Flower lanterns" and "cart lanterns" are relatively plain, but they also have their low-level fun. The protagonists of both types of lanterns are a girl and a clown, also called "Dou Meimei." They say and sing, and they can say anything nonsense; however, there must also be a system and a story. They have to go to people's houses to play with lanterns. If they encounter a closed door, it will be troublesome, and they have to play "connecting words"; if both sides are experts, they can really talk eloquently and talk for two or three hours, from "how many stars are in the sky" to "why play with lanterns" and "please open the door for wealth for the host," they should be eloquent and not pause, otherwise, they will lose face. This is also from the ninth day of the New Year to the fifteenth day. The difference between "cart lanterns" and "flower lanterns" is that the Meimei of the "cart lanterns" is always in the paper-pasted cart box and cannot get off the ground, and cannot enter the hall of people's houses, because it represents the smallest god, said to be a parturient woman.</p>

<p>However, in this vast area, there are still people who work hard and diligently. The "Volcano" poetry magazine finally appeared before us in a brand-new posture at the end of 1934, thanks to the struggle of a few young poets.</p>
<p>This event will become a miracle of 1935.</p>
<p>I read her inaugural issue on a quiet midnight. After reading it, my mind was filled with pictures of human suffering. She sang:</p>
<p>They fell by themselves without wind</p>
<p>Falling on a dusty pillow</p>
<p>On a brownish-gold old cotton robe</p>
<p>On an opened book page</p>
<p>On a hot loaf of bread covered with jam XXXX</p>
<p>Autumn is coming</p>
<p>The parasol tree shed her crimson little boat</p>
<p>And from the top of my tree</p>
<p>Falling long threadlike leaves one by one</p>
<p>Black, lusterless, soft and fine leaves</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>These fallen leaves</p>
<p>Falling from the top of my tree</p>
<p>Make me deeply nostalgic and sad</p>
<p>—Louis's "Hair"</p>
<p>Louis's works have made many contributions to "Modern" in the past. Although his lyric poems are covered with a thick fog of sadness, his delicate brushstrokes and melancholic tones are his unique style.</p>
<p>Heaven</p>
<p>Drip your blue nectar in my eyes</p>
<p>Sprinkle your blue fragrant powder on my head</p>
<p>Ah, lovely October day</p>
<p>Turn your blue soft waves</p>
<p>Lift the blue long skirt of your young girl</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>You cover me with infinite mysterious blue</p>
<p>Cover the parasol tree and the earth</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>Listen to your infinitely mysterious</p>
<p>Blue hypnotic song</p>
<p>I gradually close my drunken eyes</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>The parasol tree trembled in your hypnotic song</p>
<p>Shaking non-stop</p>
<p>Her golden shoulders</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>This gray and silent earth</p>
<p>Is also about to fall asleep</p>
<p>I heard the trembling of our poet's heart.</p>
<p>The crows came</p>
<p>Singing a black song</p>
<p>Casting my sorrow on the ground</p>
<p>Crushed like fallen leaves</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>On the pieces of fallen leaves</p>
<p>Weighing down suffocating dreams</p>
<p>A tired and heavy heart</p>
<p>Then take a crow's back to fly far away</p>
<p>This is the miserable cry of us who are confined in the iron barrel of labor and sorrow all day long, vented from the low beat by the poet's beautifying pen.</p>
<p>There is no need to cite more such examples. In short, after reading this kind of poem, although the heart feels infinitely heavy, the body gets infinite comfort instead, as if the limbs and bones are all crisp and scattered.</p>
<p>Louis, Ding Xin, Lao Mai, etc. in "Volcano" are all promising young and enthusiastic poets. I hope that in addition to self-encouragement in hardship, they must also enrich their own life experiences, find new paths for new poetry, and hope that society will no longer cruelly destroy this newly planted fresh flower. When I wrote this article, my heart was filled with so many hopes!</p>

<h3 id="e338">Biography of Einstein (1) <a href="#e338" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c338" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">338</a></h3>
<p>— From Mu</p>
<p>Albert Einstein is a world-renowned revolutionary in modern science. The emergence of his "theory of relativity" not only overturned the famous Newtonian mechanics that had dominated science for over two hundred years, throwing a powerful bomb into physics and the entire natural sciences, but also had a tremendous impact on modern philosophy and modern thought, forcing various idealistic theories and mysterious mechanical ideas to further expose their fallacies. Therefore, we can say that those who do not know Einstein's scholarship and life cannot fully understand the changes and development of modern science, philosophy, and thought.</p>
<p>I have not yet seen any systematic works on Einstein's biography and scholarship in our publishing industry. I am now introducing Einstein to everyone based on the recently published Japanese book "Biography of Einstein" (written by Kuwaki Otohiko); however, this is a rather large book, and I cannot translate it in its entirety to publish as an article. Therefore, I can only briefly compile a "Biography of Einstein" based on this book. If this can enable everyone to have a considerable understanding of this great modern scientist—Einstein—then it will not be in vain.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in the city of Ulm in southern Germany. This place is located on the left bank of the upper reaches of the Danube, which flows through Germany and Austria, and has always been an important transportation hub. Five or six hundred years ago, a large Gothic monastery was built here, with a spire 161 meters high, which is the tallest monastery building in the world. Einstein is considered to have reached the highest peak in the history of world science, and he was born in a place with the world's tallest monastery building. Isn't that interesting?</p>
<p>Six years after Einstein's birth, his family moved to Munich, where he spent his childhood.</p>
<p>When Einstein was only four or five years old, his father gave him a small compass to play with. At that time, he had an inexplicable feeling about the movement of the magnetic needle in the compass. Even after his father explained it, he still could not explain his surprise. Also, at that time, a cousin of his came from Genoa and talked about the land, people, harbors, ships, etc. of Italy. After listening to it, he was first amazed by the vastness of the world, and then he took an old box from his father's workshop to imitate a sailing game—although this cannot be regarded as a sign of his becoming a great scientist, his character and achievements are somewhat related to it.</p>
<p>However, due to the stimulation of these things, due to his feeling of the inexplicability and vastness of nature, he was led to a pantheistic religious heart that unified nature and God. His father, influenced by the utilitarian ideas of the time, was a free thinker who did not value religion and did not perform Jewish rituals in his own family. However, he hoped that Einstein would strictly abide by Jewish rules.</p>
<p>When he turned six, Einstein went to elementary school. However, at that time, he deeply felt dissatisfied with the rules of the elementary school he was in, the school's facilities, and the unequal treatment of rich and poor children in the school. At the same time, because he was Jewish, he began to suffer from anti-Semitism in his elementary school life.</p>
<p>Einstein loved art since he was a child, especially music. His mother also played the piano and liked classical things. He started learning the violin at the age of six, so when he became an adult, his musical knowledge had a considerable foundation.</p>
<p>His secondary education was also received in Munich. The school he attended was a secondary school that mainly implemented classical education in Greek and Latin. However, his impression of this secondary school was the same as his impression of the elementary school he attended: a mechanical school that implemented soulless education. However, there was a teacher there named Louis who distributed some lectures on Greek, Roman, and classical German literature, which aroused his interest in classical literature. According to what he said at the age of thirty, two or three years after he had published his first paper on relativity and his name had been noticed by some people in the academic community, he had specially visited this old teacher; but this teacher had never remembered him, and instead looked at him strangely as to why he came to visit, so he felt greatly disillusioned and hurriedly left.</p>
<p>In his youth, Einstein showed early maturity in mathematical talent. At the age of thirteen, he had already learned the elementary geometry textbook ahead of the school curriculum. However, he was different from Young and Hamilton; these two were not only precocious scientists, but also precocious in linguistic talent. Although Einstein's mathematical talent showed amazing precocity, his linguistic skills were very mediocre. He had failed an exam because his grades in language and natural history were too bad.</p>
<p>Einstein also liked philosophy books very much. Bichner's "Force and Matter," which was popular at the time, gave him a deep impression. He increasingly approached materialistic monism, but the religious psychology he had since childhood had not been completely eliminated; in his school, there was also Jewish education, and teachers Dr. Tochter and Borlai gave him unforgettable religious inspiration.</p>
<p>When he was about to graduate from secondary school, a major change occurred in his family. The electrical business run by his father failed, forcing his family to leave Munich and move to Italy, but Einstein had to stay in Munich until he graduated.</p>
<p>Einstein had no interest in his father's business and never went to his father's factory. He also had no interest in the life of the Munich streets. He was only thinking about Italy, because he had heard some things about Italy from his cousin who came from Genoa, and he thought that Italy was the paradise of this world; and his parents were in this paradise at that time, and in their correspondence, they made him imagine how bright and free Italy was. One day, he quickly went to his parents' side. Because he really wanted to go to Italy, he asked a doctor for a leave of absence certificate with the reason of neurasthenia without waiting for graduation. Since then, for half a year, he completely left school life. Under the bright sun, in the colorful scenery of northern Italy, he socialized with the free young people of Milan.</p>

<h3 id="e344">Saint of Love? Prodigal Son? Don Juan in the Eyes of Douglas Fairbanks <a href="#e344" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c344" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">344</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Don Juan, everyone probably knows him, right? What kind of person is he after all? A hero? A rogue? Or is he a romantic master who hopes to get perfect love? Or a pornographic pervert who uses women for entertainment? Like this, it is really not easy to make a judgment if you don't have a deep understanding of Don Juan. He has so many concubines and beauties, and his romantic affairs are widely spread. What kind of person can you say he is?</p>
<p>Not long ago, Douglas Fairbanks left Hollywood to produce films in Europe. Under the leadership of the famous director Alexander Korda, he has completed a giant film about Don Juan's life of romance, "The Private Life of Don Juan" (which will be shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater in Shanghai). For this matter, he actually went to Seville, Spain—Don Juan's former residence—to study his life in detail. He understood Don Juan's life of distress, and knew that his love was not as crazy and romantic as outsiders imagined. He knew that Don Juan was an idealist. A big lover with oversensitive thoughts and rich emotions. He spent his life pursuing a perfect woman in his mind. Comparatively, he lived in Seville for the longest time, but this is not very important, just because Seville is his hometown. He spent his entire life pursuing his ideal perfect lover, but this pursuit always disappointed him. Because the woman he idealized was too good, too perfect, there was simply no such woman, and there never would be. What he pursued day and night was only what poets fantasized about, what musicians played, and what artists created, not a real person. Although the number of women he got in his life was countless, they were just ordinary people. Of course, they all had the beauty of sinking fish and falling geese, and the appearance of closing the moon and shaming flowers, but they were still far from his ideal.</p>
<p>Don Juan is handsome. What can be seen on the outside is his handsome appearance, and what is contained in his heart is rich passion. When women meet him, they will pursue him and refuse to leave him. For this reason, he had to wander around! In this way, he was said to be a "playboy"! Poor Don Juan! He spent his life's energy and never found the woman he admired. How can we say that he is a pornographic pervert? He avoided many women to escape, so how can we say that he is a playboy? The shortcoming of his life is because he cherished women too much. He could not bear to make them suffer the pain of disappointed love, so he accepted the criticism of "unfaithfulness." How can the world understand his inner hidden pain?</p>
<p>Although in our view, the woman he pursued was too idealized. However, when Don Juan was in Seville, the organization of life was not as mechanized as it is now. The place where he lived was in a poetic environment and romantic mood. Therefore, he had too much hope for the realization of his ideal. We really can't blame him.</p>
<p>The great English poet Byron also wrote a lot of descriptions of Don Juan's life, but the events written are not necessarily true facts. If we want to truly understand Don Juan, we have to actually collect all the biographies and anecdotes about him, analyze him, and then we can understand Don Juan's true face. Of course, a person's life has its length, its good and its evil, but the writer often likes to nitpick and write about his shortcomings, and magnify his evil deeds. His original true face is wiped out with one stroke.</p>
<p>In short, we must understand that Don Juan's life was to seek the perfect, flawless beauty in his ideal from the romantic process, but he was finally disappointed.</p>

<h3 id="e345">Review of "One Exciting Adventure" <a href="#e345" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c345" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">345</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Lun</p>
<p>One Exciting</p>
<p>Adventure—Great Shanghai</p>
<p>This "One Exciting Adventure," which condescended to have Lande Chuan perform his skills as an accompanist, does not reduce its shortcomings due to its shortness in many mediocre detective films.</p>
<p>It concocts a group of inexplicable characters. The girl Lina goes everywhere to steal with her unparalleled beauty, saying that it is due to the playful attitude of neurasthenia. The young man Le Fo Sha sat in the car and followed her around. He paid the losses of the owners everywhere, saying it was because he loved her. Under this almost mysterious and bizarre setting, the plot unfolded. Detective Fox used the fragrance of the gloves she lost in a theft to pull out the perfumer Walder. Walder fell in love with her at first sight, and the three of them made a big fuss over their love affairs, plus that idiotic and silly Sin Sili's gag. As a result, it was discovered in the file that Le Fo Sha was originally a famous swindler. So he paid money to the two investigators to acquit her. At the same time, Lina recovered from her old illness and married the perfumer.</p>
<p>From the point of view of its performance, naturally, in such a script, there will be no special achievements. Like many mediocre detective films in the period of decline, the performance tries to avoid some boring exploration and serious investigation, and interweaves the progress of the case with love and song and dance. Even the detectives and other characters who handle the case are caricatured and gagged to increase the relaxed and interesting atmosphere. This is the way for general producers to hide their clumsiness, and it is also the inevitable manifestation of poor skills.</p>
<p>Director E. Franke is not seen here to be outstanding. He is only more successful in writing the mysterious and elusive parts of the heroine Lina, and trying to use the atmosphere to set off her personality.</p>
<p>Binnje Barnes' Lina is not mysterious and unrestrained enough when she is calm. She is also not unrestrained and fervent enough when she is passionate. The actors who play Walder and Le Fo Sha are even more mediocre. Grant Mitchell, who plays Fox, portrays a certain type of person in society quite incisively.</p>

<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Elinor Norton – A Cathay Production</p>
<p>The young girl Elinor abandons Harley, who loves her, and follows her grandmother's advice to marry Donald. Her husband's jealousy causes her great marital pain. After Donald goes off to war, she falls in love with another young man, Lynn. However, things don't always go as planned. Donald returns, and in addition to his jealous nature, the war has turned him into a neurotic patient. Elinor is now torn between pity for her husband and love for her lover, becoming a prisoner of love and jealousy. After much turmoil and conflict, they eventually reach the destination of love's union.</p>
<p>The original author, Mary Roberts Reinhart, already created a vulgar and superficial work. Rose Franken failed to treat it with cinematic artistry and simply created a lengthy and rambling film based on the original. In addition to jokes such as a jealous husband willing to partner in a ranch with his wife's lover and agreeing to a six-month trial period of love with his rival, the film emphasizes the coincidence of the husband falling off his horse in a remote area and the lover arriving by car to rescue him, using this as a key element of the entire drama. Unnecessary war scenes are inserted into the gentle tone of the play. Perhaps this was deliberately arranged to increase the play's power and to set off the scene of Elinor and her lover riding horses, but the abruptness and awkwardness are enough to disrupt the mood of the entire play, which is an obvious shortcoming.</p>
<p>Director Hamilton MacFadden has worked hard to achieve some success. Apart from being limited by the script, some individual scenes show considerable skill and cleverness. For example, the passionate love of the newlyweds before the jealousy erupts is written in a very mysterious and pure way. After the quarrel, the wife's psychological pain and her confession to her husband, as well as the snow scene, delicately entrust the mood of the characters to the surrounding things, which is commendable. The setting and handling of the climax are also more appropriate and sufficient, achieving considerable effect. After the sudden change at the climax, there is a refreshing ending. Similarly, feelings are entrusted to the scenery, showing the development of another realm. However, the depiction of the war has a hint of cutting corners, doesn't it? Since it was a fierce battle, the casualties would certainly not be like the scene on the screen, with only Donald and one or two others.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Claire Trevor is better as Elinor. Her portrayal of the conflicting emotions of love and pity is quite moving and represents progress compared to her role in "Little Miss Broadway." The role of Lynn was originally easy to succeed in, but Gilbert Roland did not achieve the deserved results. Hugh Williams seems to be very good at acting, but here he failed to adequately express the character's love for his wife and his jealous hatred. He was able to let the neurotic patient play out as well, but it passed by uneventfully.</p>

<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Moviegoers with good memories will surely still remember Pola Negri, who enjoyed great fame in the silent film era. After disappearing from the screen for about three years, she has now returned to Hollywood as an actress once again.</p>
<p>Her first film is said to be based on the life of Frederic Chopin, the famous 19th-century Polish composer. Warner Brothers is currently negotiating various conditions with her, and because Pola likes the story very much, there probably won't be any problems.</p>
<p>But in fact, Pola doesn't seem to be paying much attention to returning to the screen. She is currently focusing on how to arrange the Valentino's house that she recently bought.</p>
<p>"I have decided to spend the rest of my life here," Pola told reporters, "and only in this house can I live happily, often reminiscing about the sweet love between Valentino and me. I think he must like me living here too!"</p>
<p>Did you know that Pola and Valentino were a couple in the past?</p>

<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Lang Deshan, a native of Shandong, has traveled the world for thirty years, promoting China's inherent technology abroad and gaining great renown. Three years ago, he returned to China once and performed at the Nanjing Grand Theater in this city. The success of ticket sales was unparalleled. Foreign residents in Europe and America have long admired Mr. Lang's technology and were eager to see it. And we Chinese people also hoped to see Mr. Lang's accomplishments in promoting national quintessence for the country. Mr. Lang's two daughters have reached the age of marriage, and he himself has reached retirement age. Three years ago, he intended to spend his remaining years in his homeland. However, due to the firm invitation of overseas theaters to perform for the last time, Mr. Lang reluctantly agreed. Over the past three years, he has traveled across Europe and America. Now he is returning home. His performance at the Grand Shanghai Theater in this city will probably also be his last time to meet the people of Shanghai. It is said that whether Mr. Lang will live in Shanghai for a long time is still undecided. After his two daughters are married off, he may return to his hometown to live out his days.</p>

<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Dillon groaned a few more times, moaning, "Because I... Ooh... Ate something too bitter... Burned it... And... Bad luck came one after another. First, the car fell into the ditch. Then it rained, soaking me through. Then I burned myself. Now I've caught a cold. This day... This night..." Geoffrey looked at him strangely, then asked insincerely, "What about Marie? How is she?" Dillon pouted, "Marie! Why even ask about her. I think she's very comfortable there. She left me and left. She wasn't burned... She didn't even catch a cold. I'm afraid she slept more comfortably last night than ever before... I don't even know where she slept."</p>
<p>Geoffrey listened, at first not daring to believe his own ears. After a while, she suddenly burst out laughing. He laughed and laughed, laughing uncontrollably. Dillon asked, "What's wrong? So happy?" Geoffrey shook his head, "You wouldn't understand. Get up, Casanova." He then helped Dillon up, helped him get dressed, and prepared to go home.</p>
<p>On their way home, they could have been safe and sound. But halfway, they met Connie again. Connie and Johnson were looking for her husband together. But on the way, the tire burst. Connie got out of the car and paced back and forth on the road, fuming. Johnson crawled on the ground to fix the tire. Geoffrey's car arrived at this place and quickly slammed on the brakes. Connie glared at Dillon fiercely. At this time, Dillon was sitting next to the driver in the front, indescribably miserable. He looked at Connie with wide, unfocused eyes and a pleading expression, saying, "Connie... Let's talk it over..." Connie heard this and roared like thunder, "Me? Talk it over? You bastard! Look at you, what a wonderful family reunion!" He shouted and argued, even Paula, Marie, and Geoffrey, who were sitting in the back, were scolded along with him. "What exactly is going on? Tell me. But even if you don't tell me, can't I guess?"</p>
<p>Geoffrey, of course, had to step forward again. He politely said to Mrs. Duda, "It's not good to talk on the road now. If you're willing to get in our car, we'll naturally come up with a solution when we get to the city." Connie reluctantly listened to him and got into their car. Geoffrey started negotiating with Connie along the way. Marie was constantly mocking and scolding Geoffrey from time to time. But Geoffrey ignored her. He soon negotiated with Connie. He asked Dillon to give her one million dollars in alimony, and they would divorce. Dillon listened in the front and had no choice but to vaguely agree. Marie, of course, had nothing to say.</p>
<p>Soon, they had arrived in front of Dillon's residence. All the problems had been solved. Dillon had no choice but to go inside, take his belongings, and move to the club or go to the hospital to recover. Connie, on the other hand, scheduled to go to Mexico tomorrow to complete the divorce procedures. Geoffrey helped Dillon out of the car, up the steps, and into the elevator. But when he backed out and walked outside the gate, Marie and Paula had already driven away in the original car and were already out of reach.</p>
<p>Geoffrey couldn't help but curse inwardly and quickly hailed a streetcar to chase after them. By the time he caught up with Marie, Marie was already about to enter her house. Geoffrey jumped out of the car, rushed forward, and grabbed Marie's arm, saying, "Marie... Are you angry with me?" Marie struggled, trying to push his hand away, but couldn't break free. She shouted, "Let go... My arm hurts..." Geoffrey begged, "That was unavoidable. Connie was prepared to make a big deal out of this. I had no choice but to stabilize her first... Let her think you were willing to marry Dillon." Marie suddenly turned around and said to him, "Let her think I was willing to marry Dillon? I'm definitely going to marry him. What do you think?"
