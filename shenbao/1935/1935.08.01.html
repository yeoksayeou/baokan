<h3>廢除比率制後之英美海軍競賽</h3>
<p>— 緯</p>
<p>今日英國外交政策。已大白於世界矣。英國素來矯飾其紳士態度。强自辯解其外交政策。曰謀集體安全。曰謀維護歐洲和平。對遠東方面。則曰謀英美合作。以維持太平洋之安寗。前如南菲斯末資將軍及羅先侯爵皆竭力鼓吹英美合作。呼籲遠東和平。近則現內閣不管部大臣艾登。亦謂『英國獲得美國之親密合作。乃英國政府之特別目的。』此種高唱入雲之聲浪。吾人聞之。恍若保守黨控制下之英國政府。眞能為遠東和平之有力支持者然。然而按其實際。則　謂集體安。全維護歐洲和平。對遠東合作。皆不兌現之空頭支票耳。盎格羅撤克遜。固一實利主義民族也。方其外交家奔走歐陸和平。世人心目中皆以為不列顚外交政策。已放棄其狹隘的孤立主義矣。曾幾何時。英國突然擺脫倫敦協定斯脫萊薩會議之束縛。對德成立海軍協定。實行廢棄凡爾賽和約海軍條欵矣。英國斯舉。直接放棄其集體安全之主張。復返皮佛洛克卿所主張之光榮孤立。間接亦予海軍限制以重大打擊。乃為明顯之事實。此種政策。在英國自身。自屬躊躇滿志。在國際實足以引起險惡之波瀾。今者一波未平。一波又起。英海相孟珊兒在英國下院宣佈廢除海軍比率制矣。英國此舉之目的果何在乎。比率制之廢除。日之所歡迎。而非美之所樂聞也。今英徇日之意而公開宣吿廢除比率制。使尙留殘喘之華盛頓五國海軍限制條欵。壽終正寢。其英日合作又將復活耶。</p>
<p>英國廢除比率制宣言。足使各國海軍競賽。益趨積極。母庸諱言。據最近消息。美國將於兩年間造艦六十八艘。其中去年度開工者。有航海母艦兩艘。乙級巡洋艦七艘。驅逐艦二十九艘。潛水艦六艘。共四十四艘。本年開工者。驅逐艦十五艘。潛水艦六艘共二十四艘。他如飛機之積極建造。汎太平洋航空路綫之積極開闢。皆深可注意。同時英國之擴充海軍。自亦不後人。路透消息傳來。謂英國擬以一萬五千萬鎊增造新軍艦。共擬增之軍艦為巡洋艦五十至七十二艘。驅逐艦八十四至一百艘。潛艇三十九至五十二艘。飛機母艦八至十艘。盎格羅撤克遜兩民族之實行海軍比賽。其聯合固足以對付其共同敵人。而其對立亦適足以予有野心者可乘之機會。惟就事實觀之。對立之形勢。殆遠過於聯合之形勢。此其英美之不拳乎。抑遠東之不幸乎。在目前囫非吾人所能逆睹者也。</p>

<h3>充滿緊張空氣　國聯行政院開會　英法合力圖弭東菲戰禍　根據條約對意提新建議　意反對阿國歸國聯代管</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）日內瓦今晨充滿緊張空氣、蓋舉世矚目之國聯行政院會議、定於今日在此開會、或將成為國聯成立以來最嚴重之會議也、行政院主席李維諾夫昨晚自加爾斯巴德抵此、繼之者為阿樂西爵士率領之意國代表團、其間相距不過數小時、艾登爵士及賴伐爾總理可望於今晨蒞此、俾在今日下午五時開會前、得有充分時間、舉行初步談話、國聯方面注意各國代表對於程序問題之態度、卽行政院是否僅限於調解、抑應直接干涉、第二辦法大槪將使意國代表退出會議、聞英國或將堅持討論衝突之根本原因、如不能獲得折衷辦法、當可獲得奧國·丹麥·葡萄牙·西班牙等國之援助、惟南美代表大槪將嚴守中立、若干方面預測、李維諾夫及土爾其代表將建議意阿兩國應重行聲明遵守凱洛格非戰公約及一九二八年意阿條約中之第五欵、該欵規定一切爭端均應付調解云、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）本日午後法國總理兼外長賴伐爾與英國不管部大臣艾登會晤、兩人交換今晨與意阿兩國代表談話後所得之印象、對於本日午後五時國聯會行政院開會時所採取之態度、賴伐爾與艾登似已有所商定、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院非常會議、法國代表卽法國國務總理兼外長賴伐爾一行、業於今晨九時抵此、英國不管部閣員艾登亦同時到達、賴伐爾總理當卽前往法國代表團辦事處、與行政院各會員國代表相接洽、此項接洽、業由辦事處人員預先約定行政院第一次會議、仍定於午後五時舉行、係屬絕對非公開性質、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）參加國聯行政院會議之各國代表今日已連袂抵此、準備對於避免意阿戰爭作最後之努力、各代表亦準備要求意國允許於平和交涉尙在進行之際、不卽以武力攻擊阿國、目前各代表最大之希望、僅為展緩最後之决裂、而並不希望能將根本問題予以解决、此點實堪注意、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）因英閣員艾登與法總理賴伐爾昨在巴黎談話之結果、現已有解决意阿爭執之新動作、今日已向羅馬提出一種辦法、主張成立英法意阿代表之少數人委員會、根據一九〇六年之條約開會研究全部地位、意國担任在此談話繼續之時、不得採行敵對行為、上述提議、可為國聯會員國所歡迎、因彼等於此可不與聞意阿爭議、而使大國負其全責也、查一九〇六年條約、英法意三國担任、（一）尊重並設法保全阿國之土地完整（二）任何一方面所得之實業讓與權、不得損害他國權利、（三）不干涉阿國內政、（四）共同行動以保障彼此在毘連阿國之領十內利益、（五）彼此協定阿國境內之鐵路建築、及三國人民在貿易與運輸上之同等待遇、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>艾登幕後活動　和平希望仍微</p>
<p>（日內瓦）英閣員艾登今晨十一時偕法國顧問往見阿國代表哈華利特、其人乃阿國駐法公使也、午時艾登又往見意代表阿洛錫、後與國聯秘書長愛文諾午餐、故意阿爭議雖未正式開會討論、然幕後現已有不少談話矣、意總代表阿洛錫在接見艾登時已與法總理賴伐爾　談良久聞各方面之談話進行尙佳、但若謂其希望甚好、則時機猶早意國接受國聯指派義務伸裁員加入調解委員會之說、現已不為人所輕信艾登欲有所作為、以壓滿輿論、使知國聯行政院不欲專偏重無關重要的邊境細故、而忘却主要之問題、</p>
<p>國聯代管阿國　羅馬認爲奇談</p>
<p>據羅馬電訊、國聯行政院今日之會議、有展緩之可能、因聞意相墨索里尼已續有各平之運也、據羅馬所傳之最近消息、意相現準備放棄其反對國聯指派第五仲裁員之主張但若調解手續卒歸無效、則行政院開會時、意國保留詳述意國理由之權、在此屆國聯行政院會議中、意國將繼續不允發表此種言論、至於以阿國為國聯保護國之說、羅馬不歡迎之、認為奇談、意國反對之最大理由、為英法二國在國聯中有極大勢力、將來對於國聯保護國之行政、握甚大權力、不能使意國滿意、且此舉在實際上等於以一九〇六年條約之三簽字國、成立英法意混合保護國、　　視條約同廢紙　不願他國分羹</p>
<p>查此條約意相早已視同廢紙矣、意國在阿進行已遠、不願他國分享其進取之利益、意國欲支配其所缺少之原料、此亦爲其對阿主要野心之一、意國梯維亞報今日載一挿畫、表示意人仇央之情感、圖中繪一阿國裸足在日內瓦議事桌下與着褲之英人腿親善狀、（卅一日路透電）</p>
<p>戰時封鎖運河　各代表付討論</p>
<p>（巴黎）據此間消息、出席國聯行政院會議之代表、今日曾積極討論意阿戰事爆發後封鎖蘇彝士運河、禁止意大利或他國船隻運輸軍火之問題之辦法、大約將由行政院授權英國或各國組織委員會、禁止任何國家開往任何地點之軍火通過蘇彝士運河、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>英法立塲　較前更見接過　艾登賴伐爾會談結果</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據巴黎路透電社消息、英法現對意阿爭議之立塲、已較三星期前更見接近、此為昨日艾登與賴伐爾兩要人會談一小時之結果、兩人曾透澈討論該問題之各面、今日艾登已赴日內瓦出席國聯行政院會議矣、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）聞昨日艾登與賴伐爾在巴黎舉行談話後、英國主張已有變史、英國本要求國聯會行政院立卽討論意阿爭執之整個問題、以免戰爭危險日見增加、但自經賴伐爾勸吿後、英國主張已不若曩時之堅執、賴伐爾以為如和平解决之希望一綫未絕、則英國所主張之程序、殊無採用之必要、蓋五月二十五日行政院决議案、本已規定非俟各項和解程序完全歸於失敗、則不應將意阿爭端作整個之討論也、英國政府因國內一般輿論要求、雖尙未完决定採納法國之觀點、然英法兩國、旣能作更進一步之合作、則行政院會議前途、自更可樂觀、大約艾登當俟與出席行政院之重要各國代表舉行談話後、方可最後决定英國之態度、但無論如何、無阻止戰爭之保隙、而遽將意阿爭端延期討論、則必為英國所堅决反對、又目前最大困難、則在阿比西尼亞方面、則以阿國政府堅持行政院立卽討論整個問題、而不允接受恢復意阿仲裁委員會之工作故也、惟阿比西尼亞雖堅持此種主張、然一般人仍以為倘能保障阿國之安全、則阿國政府或可望接受一種調和方法、且阿國安全之保障、則又為英國之所期望者也、（三十一日哈瓦斯電電）</p>
<h3>阿比西尼亞　委由國聯統治　英法談話考慮及此　倫敦官塲聲明否認</h3>
<p>（倫敦）本日泰晤士報登載巴黎消息、謂不管部大臣艾登與法國兼外長賴伐爾、曾考慮以阿比西尼亞作為國聯會委任統治地、此間官方人士、頃否認此說、（三十一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據泰晤士報駐巴黎訪員探悉、不管部大臣艾登與法國總理兼外長賴伐爾對於意阿爭執、曾考慮一種解决方法、卽不使阿比西尼亞直接向意大利作有損主權之讓步、而由國聯會以阿國自由權利保護人與歐洲利益保障人之資格、接受阿國之讓步、英法兩國、茲擬向阿國政府聲明、阿國係屬國聯會會員國、自有應監之義務、該國苟不能自行整飭內政、則國聯會當出而代謀、此項觀念現正具體化、欲以阿比西尼亞作為國聯會各會員國委任統治地、而以高級委員一員行使統治權其地位當與國聯會駐但澤高級委員相類似、然後由阿國以地方性質之讓與權給予意國、但治理之權仍操之國聯會、同時國聯會為阿國擔任保護、並在財政上予以援助、以為交換條件云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>（倫敦）現有人建議國聯應代管阿比西尼亞、藉以解决意阿之爭議、此項計畫已由未經宣露之方面達諸阿王、主張由國聯以特別經濟讓與權給予意國、而以保衛阿國免受外國侵略爲諒解、據阿京路透訪員電稱、阿王現僅表示感謝、惟阿王曾語某進見者、謂渠對於歐人勢力之原則、如純爲經濟的、則並無異議、阿人寗願在歐人指導之下而得繁榮、雅不欲獨立而貧苦云、</p>
<p>英國殖民專家裴爾氏投函泰晤士報、贊助此議、謂國聯應宣布臨時代管阿比西尼亞、而使意國合法之訴怨與權利得遂欲望云、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）晨報接獲倫敦消息、據云、頃有人向阿比西尼亞國政府提出新建議、主張由國聯會委任歐洲各國會同統治該國、而以經濟利益畁予意大利、但不畁以政治上或頒土上之特權、阿國皇帝得在國聯會各會員國中、自由選聘顧問相助爲理、阿國皇帝聞已答復、謂歐洲各國勢力、並非阿國所反對、但當純以經濟爲限、爲阿國計、與其在完全獨立之下厄於窮困、毌寗在歐洲各國頒導之下趨於繁榮云、至此項新建議係由何方提出、晨報訪員並未指出、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>抱軍事佔領决心　願推行埃及治制</p>
<p>（倫敦）有人向意國負責方面詢問對於保護領計畫之意見、據答、此尚不足解决意阿爭議、墨索里尼近曾聲明、任何國或列强對阿實施保護制、實不可能云、意人之意見、意國必須軍事佔領阿比西尼亞、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）墨索里尼之機關報意大利民報載有一文、建議阿比西尼亞應施行同於埃及之治制、謂此殊與阿有榮、蓋埃及爲古文明地、而阿比西尼亞古時流行野蠻主義也、（三十一日路透電）</p>

<p>出席聯國代表　與東京通電話　所談何事費人猜疑</p>
<p>（日內瓦）阿比西尼亞出席國聯行政院之首席代表哈華略特、今日於行政院開會前、以長途電話與東京通話、所談何事、哈氏秘不宣露、此事現巳引起外界種種之猜測、皆謂與最近日意交惡猜忌之事不無關係、（三十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>歐洲合作遇試金石　法報評論表樂觀</h3>
<p>（巴黎）「時報」登載評論、研究國聯會行政院處理意阿爭端之可能、略謂「此次行政院會議、其首要之舉、當在保全國聯會之前途、毌令意阿爭端、遽在日內瓦破裂、蓋留得靑山在、不愁沒柴燒也、就此層而論、目前趨勢似頗可樂觀、關係各國所爭執之各點、似確有成立妥協之希望、縱使英國以爲欲維持國聯會之權威與聲望、必擴大行政院討論範圍、將意阿爭端作通盤之審議、方爲有益、然國聯會行政院先行恢復意阿仲裁委員會之工作、然後靜待時機、以作最後决定、實更爲妥善、此層不久當必爲英國所瞭解、夫國聯會行政院從緩討論全部爭端、幷非故意延宕坐失時機、反之、惟有以充裕之時間、方足謀和平之解决、意阿爭端對於一般和平、其危險程度究屬何如、此惟於今後數星期內方足以覘之、總而言之、關係各國倘咸具良善之志願、妥協之精神、則任何艱難之政治問題、未有不可獲得解决者、本屆行政院會議、其或將爲合作與和平政策之一重大試騐乎」云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>人·作品與批評</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>作品是人造的。所以每一篇作品，除却公文程式似的八股文外，沒有不滲透作者底人格的。作者底人格在作品里越滲透得深切，那作品便也越使人感動。同時，那作者底人格底社會性越大，那麽，被其人格所滲透的作品底價値也越高。所以，我以爲如其一個頂好的批評家，必能從其作品中把握作者底人格。評書，卽所以評其人。實無搜羅作者無關緊要的私生活，加以中傷的攻擊底必要。</p>
<p>固然，人格不免有分裂的時候。所以在世間常常可以看到有二重人格的人。</p>
<p>形成一個人的人格底要素，大槪也就是所謂「言」和「行」吧。但比較確實的說，是「思想」和「行爲」。有了某一種思想，於是以某一種行爲表現出其思想；那就是那個人知行合一之處，也就是那個人人格統一之處。反之，有了某一種思想，却因爲社會的阻礙，使那人不能，而且不敢給表現在行爲上；甚或自暴自棄地與世浮沉，以求苟全。那便是知行不能合一，人格分裂的人。也就是所謂二重人格的人。</p>
<p>在他方面，社會亦有其最高標準的特定的道德與思想，在某一特定的社會里，常常會責求生活在這社會里的人們，秉有其特定的道德與思想。但另抱有別一種的道德與思想的人，每每跟這特定社會不相融和；但是那特定的道德與思想底壓力太大了，使他又不得不在形式上表示屈服。這種人從特定社會的視角來看，無疑是人根分裂了的二重人格的入，同時，自己根本沒有理想的；生在這個特定社會里，就以其特定的道德思想爲自己底道德思想。如其這個特定社會改變過來了，他便也跟着改變。這種人，從這特定社會的視角來看；無疑是人格完整的。在歷史上給判定爲奸雄的曹操，其所作短歌行諸樂府，我們至今讀之，尚能把握其分裂了的人格底可愛的一面。「明明如月，何時可掇；憂從中來，不可斷絕。』總屬頗近人情的話。同樣，從特定的封建社會底視角看來，十足地表現了他那忠心主人的完整人格的陳孔璋，其檄豫州文，也就因爲它發揮了封建道德與思想底最高的標準，所以直到今日，還流傅下來；萬人傳誦。但『父嵩乞匄携養，竊盜鼎司…，操整閹遺醜，本無懿德…』云云，在我們看來，實未足爲曹操罪。所以，人格分裂了的人，不一定沒有好作品；人格完整的人，不一定會有好作品。但其中也有個限度，卽人格分裂了的人，是指那時之能在自我檢閱中而意識到其分裂的痛苦的人。往古不少文學家，怕有不少人在這一種痛苦中產生其偉大作品的。</p>
<p>而且，更進一步說，一篇作品，旣已用鉛字排了出來，出現在大衆面前；那作品本身，已經作爲一個社會的存在而存在着了。這不特是那些滲透了作者的人格底作品如此，卽如公文程式似的八股文，也可看作爲一種「社會的存在」。我們讀者，皆能透過這作品，找出其產生的社會的根據。這種藝術底社會根據，雖然在複雜多態的社會裏，也可很正確而客觀地把提到。中國現在小品文底發展的社會根據，卽存在於社會的政治的不安日益深化，與其寄思於小說而從事著作，不若取直接表達思索的方式，更爲痛快，這一個原因上。批評者，如果能在其作品中，指出社會的根據時，早己更深入地給予作者一個致命的打擊了。實無再進一步攻訐作者私生活的必要。</p>
<p>能少引起些無謂的爭端，在作品本身中指摘出傾向藉此以改進文壇的批評家，我以爲，是中國現階段需要的批評家。而且我希望着有這樣的批評家底出現！</p>
<h3>白樸的金鳳釵</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>元孫季昌正宮瑞正好「集雜劇名詠情，」我曾仔細分析過，計含有元代雜劇五十七種，其中有五十五種已被我考出，詳載拙編「修辭講話」面一一一至一一五（北新版）。惟有二種不曾考出，即『「金鳳欽一斜簪在鬢影』和『他便似「竹林寺」有影無形。』</p>
<p>到了明代，沈伯英翻吳昌齡詞作「集雜劇名」，載在太設新奏卷一，頁三，四「附雜劇名」即列有「金鳳欽」和「竹林寺」兩個雜劇名；益可見孫季昌所作此二名均爲雜劇。「竹林寺」的來源不曾我到，「金鳳釵」却巳有了解决。因爲我今天偶爾翻檢北詞廣正譜，無意中竟在卷三的目次上發見了「金鳳釵」一套的排列：</p>
<p>點綘唇　混江龍　穿窗月</p>
<p>寄生草　元和令</p>
<p>上馬嬌煞</p>
<p>接着再翻正文，竟發現了兩支「金鳳釵」的曲文。頁二九（北京大學本）「穿窗月」云：</p>
<p>「憶疎狂遠隔天涯，怎知人埋怨他？吟鞭醉裊靑驄馬。莫喫秦樓酒，謝家茶。不思量執手臨岐話。」</p>
<p>題作「今　釵分」，當爲「金鳳釵分」之誤。頁四一「上馬嬌煞」云：</p>
<p>「上馬嬌歡會少，煩腦（憐）多，心緒亂如麻。偶然行至東籬下，煞自嗟自呀，冷淸淸和月對黃花。」</p>
<p>太和正音譜卷下頁六（古書流通處影印）也收有「穿窗月」；惟「遠」作「阻」，題作「白仁甫散套」。太和正音譜較北詞廣正譜先出，似較可靠。可是怎麼元人孫季昌和明人沈伯英都說是雜劇呢？總要能見到全套的原文纔好。我再翻任訥所輯的白樸散曲，（元人散曲三種本）見到他從「樂府新聲」裏輯出來的「金鳳釵分」的全套，上舉的「穿窗月」和「上馬嬌煞」都在內：</p>
<p>（仙呂點綠唇）金鳳釵分，玉京人去秋瀟灑。晚來閒暇，針綫收拾罷。獨倚危樓，十二珠　掛。風簫颯，雨晴雲乍，極目山如畫。</p>
<p>（混江龍）斷人腸處，天邊殘照水邊霞。枯荷宿驚，遠樹棲鴉。敗葉紛紛擁砌石，修竹珊珊掃窗紗。黃昏近，愁生砧杵，怨入琵琶。</p>
<p>（穿窗月）憶疎狂阻隔天涯，怎知人埋怨他？吟鞭醉裊靑驄馬。莫喫秦樓酒，謝家茶，不思量執手臨歧話？</p>
<p>（寄生草）凭闌久歸繡幃下，危樓强把金蓮撒。沉深院宇朱扉　，立蒼苔冷透凌波　襪。數歸期空畫短瓊簪，揾　啼痕頻濕香羅帕。</p>
<p>（元和令）從絕雁書，幾度結龜卦。翠眉長是鎖離愁，玉容惟悴煞。自元宵等待過重陽，甚猶然不到家？</p>
<p>（上馬嬌煞）歡會少，煩惱多，心緒亂如麻。偶然行至東籬下，自嗟自呀，冷淸淸和月對黃花。</p>
<p>此套次序與北詞廣正譜全同；李玉所見，當即此套。</p>
<p>但據我的推測，此套似非雜劇，因爲：</p>
<p>一，雜劇用仙呂點綘唇，例隨八聲甘州；而本套點綘唇，並不跟隨八聲甘州。</p>
<p>二，雜劇用點綘唇套，最短者七章，而本套則僅六章。</p>
<p>三，雜劇點綘唇套常用的曲子有油葫蘆·天下樂·哪吒令·鵲踏枝·金盞兒·後庭花·醉中天·村裏　鼓·六么序·靑哥兒·賺煞·賺煞尾·尾聲等，這些都是「金鳳釵分」套中所沒有的。</p>
<p>四，白樸此套極爲聯貫，祇是閨怨的老調。不像是戲曲中多變的情節。</p>
<p>有此四點證明，所以我認爲白樸的「金鳳釵分」不過是仙呂點綠唇套的首句，並非雜劇的一折，被孫季昌誤認爲雜，便編進「集雜劇名詠情」裏；而後人沈伯英以訛傳訛，也就認金鳳釵爲雜劇名了。</p>
<h3>白靈廟之夜</h3>
<p>— 袁塵影</p>
<p>在一個作爲我們臨時飯廳的蒙古包中，我們的男孩子女孩子們都坐了下來。爐中的火發着熊熊的光，一天吃了兩頓羊肉炒菜，饅頭，白米稀飯，那一股羊羯的味道還刺着我的鼻子發嘔。這兩頓飯眞是不好吃；羊肉炒這個，羊肉炒那個………都是羊羯的味道。在我這不健壯的人吃起來，眞是一種苦頭。我不知在荒漠中過活的蒙古人是怎麽過日子下去的。</p>
<p>吃罷了飯，夜色開始籠罩了蒙古大地，蒙古包內點起洋燭，榣曳不定的燈光使得包內的男孩子女孩子們都沉默起來，我却在愁着晚間的睡覺了；不磕睡，在冷冰冰的蒙古包中一下子怎麽能睡得着呢！</p>
<p>可喜的是這時候蒙古包中進來了四個蒙古樂師。</p>
<p>蒙古包中頓時又添了不少的我們的男孩子女孩子們，掛着門帘的包口站着一堆喇嘛，在荒漠中他們大槪也是像我們一樣，很難聽到這悲壯的蒙古樂曲聲吧？</p>
<p>黯淡的燭光，照着那四個臉發着紅光的年靑的蒙古樂師，一個吮着笛子，一個拉着四絃胡琴，一個弄着不知名的古樂器，另外一個是唱蒙古曲的年靑蒙古人。</p>
<p>樂聲起了，起先是悠長的，緩慢的，那樂聲是不同於我所聽過的一切的樂器發出的聲音；漸漸地樂聲一聲緊一聲快一聲了，恍忽間我似乎聽到蒙古包外的北風與這樂聲相和着，像一陣狂風，像一陣暴雨，它使我們這些從遠遠地地方來到這少人烟的蒙古大地中的男孩子女孩子們，都不禁悽楚起來，但這並不完全是悲哀的，悽楚中帶着壯烈！我默默地想着：假如這時候蒙古兵和着這曲拍，樂聲前進，在夜的茫茫中衝向前去；那景象該是多麽雄壯而偉大呢。</p>
<p>我胡思亂想着，我不知自己置身在什麼地方；然而歌聲起了，和着那特有的笛聲，四胡琴聲，古樂器聲，像是在唱別離曲，也像是在唱求愛曲，過後却變爲憤怒的，悲壯的行軍曲了。它使我們時而哀傷，時而歡欣，終而至於奮發起來，像是前面有着敵人要我們衝殺過去似的。……</p>
<p>在我沉浸在音樂歌聲的氛圍中的時候，一個帶着酸楚的女孩子的聲音，在我的耳邊低低的響着。「他唱的什麽歌曲？」我回頭看了看這女孩子，她眼眶子潤濕濕的，我又望了望那年靑的歌唱者，掙扎，絕望，奮發，一大串聽不懂的蒙占歌聲從他。裏吐出來，我搖搖頭；我也不曉得呵！</p>
<p>歌聲，樂聲停止了，男孩子在孩子們的掌聲辟辟乒乓的響起來，四個蒙古樂師帶將笑容，但不久又變得沉默起來了，那個唱蒙古曲的年靑人低微地嘆了一口氣，接着便在燈光中默默地向着黑暗的包外一齊走出去了。</p>
<p>從蒙古包內走出來，喇嘛們也都走散了，荒漠中原野的夜是茫茫的一片，天空被黑雲遮滿了，望不見一顆星兒，散落的蒙古包黑暗中看去，像是些圓丘，多數的蒙古包巳經熄了燈了，只有幾個包還漏出一些黯弱的燈光，間或還有手電筒一閃似的照着，發出長長的光亮，但很快地却又熄滅了。</p>
<p>我抬起頭來，向着四面望去，我看不到前面是些什麼。北面吹來的冷風像針一樣刺進了我穿着毛布大斃（註一）的皮膚，蒙古大地中似乎死絕了的一般，蒙古狗汪汪的叫，更給我添了無限的悽寂。</p>
<p>我想到白日間來這裏求生的那位日君，和那位郵局局畏的訴苦，剛才奏着樂的幾位蒙古樂師的沉默的走出去，和那一個年靑的歌唱者低微地嘆氣，我想像着這一個蒙古民族的將來和我們的命運，在黑暗中佇立了好一陣。猛然間想到聽過一位友人說晚間在這蒙古地方不一定有野獸出來的時候，我便踉蹌地走回了自己睡的蒙古包中；趕快鑽進了被中。</p>
<p>註一，毛布大氅係用毛布做成，爲綏遠特有，毛布則係用羊毛織成者。</p>
<h3>送行</h3>
<p>— 歐陽凡海</p>
<p>送你回故國，</p>
<p>故國何堪回首！</p>
<p>焦士萬里殷殷血，</p>
<p>彈壳中，難道借問白骨</p>
<p>那兒是故人的忠魂？</p>
<p>看你一身塵土，</p>
<p>只留得蕭條一副瘦骨！</p>
<p>你踽踽海外，如今隻身回去，</p>
<p>往那兒找尋那曾經十載患難的舊友？</p>
<p>嚴霜煎不熟孤傲，</p>

<h3>大學時代（三五）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>然後她走回家去、當晚一夜，第二天又一天她總坐着，縫着，直至那件貴重衣裳完全做成功為止。</p>
<p>『第二天就是星期日，』女裁縫繼續說，當她把一條綫穿進針眼　以後，「晚間，已經晏了時候，她挿上幾朶白色的五月白合花在黑頭髮裏面，就走向跳舞館去。</p>
<p>「底下事情是我的姨姪吿訴我的，」他添加上去說，「他也是一個不肯放過跳舞機會的人。——她起初很長久坐着，因爲那些靑年工匠簡直不敢走到她跟前，至於大學生，她又一個個拒絕了。似乎又要爲她鬧出亂子了。那個蒼白面色的高貴大學生，你們呌他做甚麽呢？」—</p>
<p>「『土伯爵』！」我說。陳隱之譯</p>
<p>「他當然也在那裏。但他簡直沒有理會她。後夾他不得不走來了，因爲她這晚裝得太好看；他們說她好像是從地中海東岸來的。然他走到她面前時候，她滿臉變得通紅，全身戰慄起來。但是現在她站起來了，幷把手給了他。我的姨姪說，他眼睛瞪視着她，彷彿要把她吞下肚去似的。她也再不同別的人跳舞了，一直到音樂家把提琴收拾起來時候，他們二人才離開跳舞檯。」</p>
<p>跛脚瑪麗說到這裏便沉默了；她祇還哼了兩聲，彷彿給她說的故事做了一個結論。然後她比前更加用心地繼續她的工作。</p>
<p>我知道的已經够多了；我於是决定今天晚上去赴這「魔術師底聚會」，爲的親眼去看這件故事怎樣進展。</p>
<p>郊外林中</p>
<p>天已經黑了；當我在樹叢中尋找那上山的小路時候，森林中正佈滿鬱悶的空氣。</p>
<p>我踏上石階，便不由已意地停止了脚步。我看見旁邊有幾個穿白衣服的姑娘在樹林中間穿來穿去，然後從側面走進屋子裏去。此時似乎是跳舞休息的時候；我聽見屋內，在燈火輝煌的大廳裏面，那些音樂家正在調弄他們的提琴。學生們和姑娘們活潑地談着話經過那打開的雙扇門。我禁不住要立刻走進去。那個小女孩底可愛姿態出現在我的腦筋裏頭，我在思想中又看見她掛在她那可憐父親底頸項上面；我回想起她那時怎樣執拗地拒絕了我這童眞的熱情。我的心胸突然感覺一種痛苦，我不知道究竟是由於同情呢，還是由於嫉妬？</p>
<p>最後我走上那個小柱廊底二個階級，不受人注意地站立在開着的門扇旁邊。休息時期還未完畢，但應內幷不比跳舞時少熱鬧些。學生們在牆邊棹旁或側房裏坐着，談說着，並碰着酒杯；姑娘們則滿臉笑容走來走去；時常又有一聲放蕩的呌喊響徹了全廳。</p>
<p>這些姑　中間有幾個活潑可愛的面孔，稚氣未脫的姿態，又具熱情的圓大的眼睛，——這種眼睛　　無憂無慮一味享樂的感情或者一種暫時懊惱的感情，更加使人感受她們的魔力。她們雖然是窮苦人家女兒，但都穿得很乾凈，一律淺白色的透明的衣裳，一朶花或一個新鮮花環挿在那細心編織起來的頭髮裏面。</p>
<p>但那些男舞伴並不像她們那樣整潔和文雅，尤其是那些年輕的學生以及這俱樂部底幾個所謂『頭腦』，簡直不害怕在他們的女舞伴面前就把大腿輕肆地仲到棹子或凳子上面去。</p>
<p>我用眼睛我尋娜麗，不久就把她尋到了。她在幾個年輕的姑娘中間對着彈子房坐着：她們正在活潑地談話，但她則不言不語向前直視。她的頭上挿一朶白玫瑰，這花在這季候是很希罕的；但她臉上底玫瑰季候也巳經過去了：已經沒有一點紅暈現出在她那溫柔的蒼白的面頰上了。</p>

<p>兒童年實施辦法大綱之訂定、</p>
<p>民國二十三年十月教育部擬訂兒童年實施辦法大綱草案、咨請內政部核奪、</p>

<p>內教兩部、奉到行政院訓令後、即召集內教實三部主管人員、於三月十六日十九兩日、舉行兩次籌備會議、訂定兒童年實施程序、並通過全國兒童年實施委員會組織規程及經費概算書、</p>
<p>三月三十日·內教兩部將修正之兒童年實施辦法大綱及委員會組織規程會呈行政院、請予備案、</p>

<h3>兒童年與兒童福利　教育部王部長代表馬宗榮　昨晚在中央廣播電台講演</h3>
<p>昨晚爲兒童年開幕前夕日、教部簡任秘書馬宗榮代表教長王世杰在中央廣播電台講演「兒童年與兒童福利」演詞如下、</p>
<p>諸位、政府已經宣告從民國二十四年八月一日起到二十五年七月三十一日止是中華民國的兒童年、明天就是舉行全國兒童年開幕典禮的一天、這是值得爲我們全國的兒童祝福、值得爲我們中華民族慶賀的一件事、所以今天特提出這個問題——兒童年與兒童福利——和諸位講講、</p>
<p>什麼呌做兒童年呢、簡單的說、就是想在這一年中努力於兒童福利運動、俾兒童今後的生活、一天比一天幸福的意思、這種運動、不是中國才新創出來的新花樣、美國政府曾於民國七年舉行過大規模的兒童保護運動、民國十二年前後、日本也舉行過兒童保護運動、其他各國、也曾有過同樣的運動、</p>
<p>我們何以要舉行兒童年呢、其理由很多、現在姑舉出四項理由向諸位說說、</p>
<p>（一）從人類本能的欲求上說、我們要舉行兒童年、因爲生物均有自己保存與種族保存的兩種慾望、所謂自己保存的慾望、就是要求長命的意思、所謂種族保存的慾望、就是要求子孫繁榮的意思、有這兩種慾望、生物永遠可以存續、無限的發展、這兩種慾望中、無論那一種均屬重要、但從生物學的見地而觀、則以種族保存較自己保存重要、人類既屬生物之一、應該爲種族保存而有所活動、這是我們舉行兒童年的理由之一</p>
<p>（二）從人類的理想上說、我們要舉行兒童年、因爲人類是有理想的動物、所謂理想者、爲人類得到達的最高文化的完成、人類社會應該達到這種理想、而常好好的努力、爲到達這個目的計、除需要現在的人好好的努力外、還要後繼者的繼承奮鬥、即是說頗需要優秀的後繼者——兒童——、這是我們要舉行兒童年理由之二、</p>
<p>（三）從鞏固國家社會的基礎上說、我們要舉行兒童年、因爲人民的強弱、和其國家的消長隆替、有密切的關係、而人民的強弱、與兒童之健康與否、適成正比例、所以美國於一九一八年舉行大規模的兒童保護運動時、其標語有「健全的兒童是偉大國家的基礎」、一語、民國十二年前後、日本舉行兒童保護運動、其標語有「健國的基礎、自兒童始」、語、故欲樹立健全的國家之基礎、非先謀其後繼者的兒童之健康不可、這是我國要舉行兒童年理由之三、</p>
<p>除了上述的三種理由之外、還有一點是要附帶說明的、誠然天下無不愛其子的父母、所以有人以爲父慈母愛的事、是用不着大吹大擂的來提倡的、可是從來爲父母的人、多存以兒童爲自己的私有物的觀念、爲國家爲社念而養育兒童的思想、比較缺乏、且有不能充分盡其教養之義務的、但衹近時、兒童享有作為國家社會之一員養育的權利、若家庭不能充分盡其養育的義務、國家社會應出面親自養育他、惟有必需注意的一點、即兒童的教育、本來雖爲國家社會的本務、但在家庭教養兒童、是最自然最適當的、故兒童的教育不能說非由國家社會直接教育之不可、惟家庭不能充分履行兒童的愛護時、或兒童無適當的家庭時、國家社會始出血擔負教育他的任務、所以我們舉兒童年的意義、第一、是要努力於宜傳兒童愛護的必要與方法、以期全國民眾愛兒童的意識濃厚化、有一種正確的認識、且知所教養之道、第二、要想鼓勵家庭、社會和國家三方面分工合作起來、從事兒童福利事業的建設、這是我們舉行兒童年理由之四、由政府出來規定學曆二十四年度爲兒童年的意義、即在乎此、</p>
<p>兄弟在前節的講稱中、用了一個兒童福利事業的名辭、什麼呌做兒童福利事業呢、可大別爲兩項來說、第一、是力未「兒童義務教育的普及」、第二、力事「兒童保護事業的提倡」、</p>
<p>先說「兒童義務教育的普及」問題、掃除中國文盲、實在是緊要的工作、但要掃除文盲、一方面固然要使幼年失學的成人受成年補習教育、一方面務求兒童人人能受義務教育、而兒童的義務教育、較成年的補習教育尤爲重要、因爲幼年失學的成人、其數固然眾多、然茍文盲的兒童不再加多、則其數目自當有限、及之、兒童是繼續誕生的、若兒童的義務教育不能普及、便不能斷絕文盲的來源、阻礙國家社會的文化的發展、自然甚大、而兒童本身、因目不識丁、其一生所受的痛苦也很厲害、</p>
<p>因此之故、本年五月二十八日行政院第二一四次會議已修正通過實施義務教育辦法大綱、自二十四年度起開始實施、其目的在使全國學齡兒童逐漸出受一年制或二年制的短期小學等訓練達於一律受四年制的初級小學的義務教育、實施程序分爲三期、自民國二十四年八月起至二十九年七月止五年間爲第一期、在此期內、除擴充四年制初級小學、並將現有小學的改爲二部編制、現有學級擴充學額、現有私塾整理改良外、各省市應辦理一年制的短期小學、俾一切年長失學兒童及未入學的學齡兒童於少應受一年義務教育、經費已嚴令地方籌備、中央並得酌量補助、二十四年度已經決定分別補助二十四萬元、師資的養成、校舍的籌措、也規定有相當的計劃、務期於民國二十八年度終了時、一年制的義務教育普及全國各省市、受一年制義務教育的兒童達學齡兒童數百分之八十、假若我們的理想能逐漸實現、兒童社會國家所受的福利很大、在這兒童年開的當兒、兄弟謹爲全國兒童請命、希望我父老兄弟諸姑姊妹直接間接地援助政府完成義務教育第一期的計劃、廣設一年制的短期小學、不收學費、供給書籍學用品、一面仍努力於四年制初級小學的擴張、使全國兒童有受教育機會、文盲滅絕、則造福於全國兒童及社會國家很大、</p>
<p>其次講「兒童保護事業、」兒童保護事業、其中所包含的事業很多、大致可分爲六種、就是（一）母性保護事業、（二）乳幼兒保護事業、（三）兒童勞動保護事業、（四）不幸兒童救護事業、（五）虛弱兒童養護事業、（六）不良兒童感化事業、</p>
<p>母性保護就是保護有孕的婦人及產婦、因爲胎兒的安產、不僅是做父母的人所希望的、也是全社會所希望的、故社會當然應盡保全兒童生命的義務、但照統計看來、兒童生出時、往往發生障碍、考其原因所在、不外對於母性保護事業尚未能充分的顧及、對於母性的教育、未能徹底之故、所以母性保護、是兒童保護事業上不可忽視的、</p>
<p>其次、乳幼兒雖已安全的產生、如不能健全的長成、像死亡或身體虛弱、造成孳弱的國民、不僅爲乳幼兒父母的損失、故乳幼兒有充分保護他們的必要、</p>
<p>又次說勞動兒童的保護、所謂兒童勞動的保護、是不使兒童爲不適當的勞動的意義無論從事自家的業務、或幫人做工、凡有礙兒童心身發育的勞動、皆在禁止之列、</p>
<p>再說不幸兒童的救護、所謂不幸兒童、如被虐待的兒童、孤兒、遺棄的兒童等、這種兒童的環境、十分意劣、若將他置之不顧、不僅是人道所不許、即從社會的發達上說、也受其障碍、故不幸兒童的救護、是值得注意的兒童保護事業、</p>
<p>再說虛弱兒童養護事業、所謂虛弱兒童如貧血、心臟弱、肺弱、的兒童等、這兒童因身體虛弱的緣故、一切活動、不能與普通兒童並駕齊驅、甚至於有夭折生命的危險、故以此項兒童爲對象、而加以特殊的養護、使他們恢復健康、與普通兒童爲伍、這也是必要的兒童保護事業、</p>
<p>最後說不良兒童的感化事業、因爲兒童的犯罪、近年以來、有增加的傾向、這是世界各國共有的事實、雖加以刑罰、但改過向善的效果很小、故對於這些兒童、與其加以刑罰、不如加以保護、極積地感化他們、教育他們使知犯罪爲可恥、並培養他戰勝惡劣的誘惑的意志力、俾完成有教無類、物無棄材的理想、</p>
<p>其他如身體異常精神異常的兒童即盲兒、聾啞兒、殘廢兒、低能兒、白痴兒等的教育、也可看作廣義的兒童保護事業、</p>
<p>根據以上所說兒童年的意義、從兒童年開幕後、我們要逐步的努力於以下所說的實際　設、以促進兒童的福利、</p>
<p>（一）實施父母教育、以宣傳愛護兒童的思想、並使其保護方法科學化、</p>
<p>（二）普及兒童義務教育、以期兒童能得着教育機會均等的福利、</p>
<p>（三）廣設母親諮詢處、產院、乳兒院、牛乳供給所、托兒所、兒童健康諮詢處、等以事保護乳幼兒、</p>
<p>（四）制定童工法、努力於勞動兒童的健康保護、廣施徒弟教育、廣設職業指導所、以事保護兒童勞動、</p>
<p>（五）廣設兒童虐待防止令、盲兒院、制定兒童虐待法、以事救護不幸兒童、</p>
<p>（六）廣設夏季健康營、林間學校、臨海學校、以事養護虛弱兒童、</p>
<p>（七）設立感化院、制定少年保護法、以事保護不良兒童</p>
<p>（八）廣設盲啞學校、殘廢學校等、以事異常兒童的保護、</p>
<p>以上所舉各項施設、如能逐步實現、中國全國兒童受福無疆、兄弟謹在全國兒童年行將開幕的當兒、預爲全國兒童祝福、</p>

<p>第一章　新境界</p>
<p>一輛公共馬車從遠處得得而來，到一所大宅的門前，馬夫勒住了馬，放下了一個衣服襤褸的童子。便有人開着柵欄大門迎接出來。這童子忙問那人道，「先生，請你告訴我。這是梅荘嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，誰派你來的？」</p>
<p>「勞先生。我並帶了一封信，是送給這裏的女東家的。」</p>
<p>「行；那所屋子，把信給她；她就會照顧你的，小把戲。」</p>
<p>那人說來具有一種愉快的情調。乃德一便是這童子的名字——被這幾句話所鼓舞，就一路走去，心裏好不舒暢。其時天已下着稀疏的雨點，灑着茸生的細草和含苞的花樹。從那如酥的春雨裏望去，乃德已見到一所方形大屋在他的前面，—看去卻自有一番欣悅的氣象，令人樂於接近，因爲它有廣闊的走廊，寬敞的階陛，還有許多窗，窗裏又見許多燈照着。裏面分明沒有裝設百葉片或幔幕，所以那歡樂的光芒自會透窗而出；他在沒有叫門以前，略有停佇，見裏面墙上映着無數小影子在旋舞，又隱約聽到許多少年人和悅的聲音私忖屋內這般的光明溫暖及安樂，像他那樣的一個孤苦令仃的「小把戲」總是沒分的吧。</p>
<p>雖然如此，他還自己想道，「我望那女東家，真會照顧的；」於是就拿起門上的大銅鈕，——一個嬉嬉笑臉的老人頭形——作輕輕的一聲。</p>
<p>接着一個玫瑰色臉兒的女僕開了門，他一聲不響只遞過那封信，她接了過來，微笑着，她彷彿慣於接受陌生童子的，因爲她指點門內小間的一個座位、向他一點頭、說道：</p>
<p>「坐在那裏，就在席上歇一歇，讓我把這個送給太太去。」</p>
<p>乃德等着的時候，見得有許許多多的東西，足資娛賞，他以奮異的神色張眼四望，覺得這景象甚是有味，同時卻私幸能躱在門邊一個收藏的角落裏去觀察一切，自己倒不會被人暼見的。</p>

<h3>紗花　籌碼鬆濫　紗市漲勢遭打擊　實銷滯鈍…多頭了結…反動歷起</h3>
<p>紗市上日飛五元外、引起獲利者了結矣、今則反動歷起、市盤下落、此種情形、完全一般投機商發生狂熱心思、多數在市播放空氣、人氣恍惚不定、市場審碼充足、市價起伏不一、但銀行界之多頭、略有吐出、惟某方面拉緊仍不放鬆、不過現紗生意、益覺滯遲、</p>

<h3>漢埠棉市微堅銷路則滯</h3>
<p>（漢口通信）、最近漢市棉花狀況、仍屬疲憊、但上海標花步漲、每擔提高四元外、然漢埠因水災劇烈、奉安廠因被水淹停車、第　民生兩紗廠因紗市不振而停工、現僅裕華申新兩廠照常開工、當地銷量頓減、出口本可有起色之望、以買方資金不易調撥、成交仍少、廠銷申新購　城產　百大件、價　十八元四角、出口　亦僅松茂長購新野產　百件、價爲二十七元八角、黃　義興購厲山環潭一百十包、價爲二十七元七角、合計市秤八百二十擔、價提漲五角左右、存棉共約十一萬擔、盛星堆棧約　萬擔、郵儲局提存打包廠外、尚有九萬餘擔之譜、市面仍有步漲之勢云、</p>

<h3>湖北新棉產因水災受損</h3>
<p>湖北省產棉地、因水災所受損害不少、最近估計產量約一百八十萬擔、其後水退甚速、似可樂觀、據最近調查所得、約有百九十萬擔之希望、查去年同類之估計爲二百二十萬擔、但實收爲一百七十萬擔、今年棉田較去年約增成、漢口附近平漢　　沿長江一帶、本年本可豐收、惟因水災約損失　成、較去年同期並無減少、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米約存六十萬包</h3>
<p>洋米源源進口以後、米市常居平局、但目下到貨已斷、存底漸減、昨據米業中調查其各棧存貨如下、</p>
<p>和興棧一萬一千包、義泰興十八萬包、公司棧一萬二千包、鴻升　萬七千包、其昌三萬包、太古四千包、招商南棧五千包、大來棧一千六百包、元　棧二萬一千包、華通棧一萬八千包、隆茂七萬包、華棧一萬包、中棧　萬八千包、未經列入上述各棧者尚有十萬餘包、總數存底約有五十七八萬包、此外另有　船開出在途、大約在二三天後　中、計裝有西貨米二萬包、共計尚有六十萬包以上云、</p>
<h3>杜粳洋米俱見回好</h3>
<p>本米（滬南）昨日各幫來源共到十七號、（貨共一千五六百石、）銷塲本街雖屬未爽、然售方只有不顧　小之心、故形勢平定、各厚粳價無榮辱、而薄稻包胃有天津龍口烟台等都辦一千餘包、零胃亦有動動、是其市色呈定中帶緊之象、鮮高貨已同起數分、至東新粳自初盤開後、曾一途下跌、已達　元之數、故在此十元關口、或可稍事盤旋、蘆尖貨之帶秀沂角、變元未開、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源十四五號、市上去胃白粳走化平常、價形平疲、東新粳到有二百四五十石、市價定勢、薄稻到銷兩和、價轉軟勢、白元及其餘各貨和平之勢、</p>
<p>洋米昨市形勢更見挺俏、因存底遂減、後定不划、新到已絕、國戶與行商均一致望好、戶與內地長江各幫問津、行情乃立漲一角半至一角不等、全日開出西貢八千包、小絞高貫暹邏各米一千多包、貨主尚在看高喊大、如今明日本客去化再旺、則市價或須步砌若干也、</p>
<h3>粉麥豆餅割無多　現麥市況仍屬良好</h3>
<p>雜糧交易、未見暢旺、小麥交割、共祇七車、計仁成交二車、慎昌文三車、潤德交一車、鼎泰交一車、收進者、計志誠永收六車、恒盛久收一車、豆餅交割四千片、由內地幫收去、標油一百擔由本街收去云、</p>
<p>現麥市面、仍舊良好、特高貨又喊高三五分中次如常、開宿州山東麥三元六角四分、張八嶺瑤灣麥三元六角二分、大利集麥三元六角、大橋高郵麥三元五角七八分、次五角、實應麥三元五角八分半、次八分、六合麥三元五角四分、次五角二三分、鎮江麥三元四角七分、南京麥三元三角七分、丹陽麥三元五角半、江新州麥三元五角三五分、由福新去七千包、申大去二千包、信大去一千五百包云、</p>
<p>昨爲上月份期粉交割、實在數量、殊見淡寞、祇九豐之山鹿交進七千包、由本街掮客、零星收去、至津幫方面、聞月底曾收進十餘萬包、價照當時標準、市面前途、據傳通貨之諳、未有可據、人心當可緩和、不過廠家未見旺積、或者暫能址住、亦未可知云、</p>
<p>美國小麥據電訊稱、歐州作物狀況頗佳、又廠市於末後呈疲、致市況亦起鬆動、預測私人估計之數目將見激減、價再軟時可以買進、</p>

<h3>九江新豆市面穩固由來　客豆餅貨稀市漲</h3>
<p>九江新豆、爲勢頗穩、原因到頭不多、昨日祇到四十五包、貨品與前相仿、價開原盤三元八角、由寗波幫辦去、刻下大勢各地新豆登塲延遲、但銷塲已在佇望、而祇九江等豆應市、市況頗穩、豆餅晨市平定、午後因客餅來源不接、致市氣激升分許、統市成交客餅九千餘片、各廠四牌餅二萬四千餘片、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲價過廉大有轉機　橫濱紐約絲市漸復常　本埠絲織廠亦已漲價　B級白廠經已漲起五〇—八〇元</h3>
<p>邇來絲市、因國外需求頗殷、且得銀價低落之助竟有扶搖直上之勢、B字等級二零至二二分之白廠經、較前月漲五十元至八十元不等、滬埠絲商均竸相拋售、期貨已開至十月份、故各絲廠雖在酷暑中、仍開全工趕製、絲業前途似頗可樂觀、據目前人心及蘭本推算、絲價漲風尚有餘勁可持也、</p>
<p>橫濱紐約絲市、亦曾一度狂漲、甚至近遠期相距六十元者、現在已漸入常軌、然市氣消堅、正如本埠</p>
<p>本埠各絲織廠亦因絲價漸貴、於本月（八月）起亦酌量漲價、故非上月可比、</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油漢市飛騰　洋荘每擔售至四十七元</h3>
<p>白桐油市面之漲跌、完全緊於出口之盛衰、本年國外貿易、似較往年爲旺、故自春至夏、半年來每擔已漲起十四五元、漲風之勁、已爲最近四五年來所未有、而上週漲風尤烈、前週漢口售洋荘每擔價格僅由三十九元五六角加至四十元零七角、迨入上週駐漢各洋行均開始採辦、此爭彼奪、形同搶辦、以致一週間價格無日不加、至前日已加至四十七元、時僅一週、漲起六元三四角、漲風之盛、已突破最新紀錄、且各產地已早被洋荘搜羅殆遍、故存積自入夏後、已有單薄之報告、近且更甚、在洋莊方面觀察、需貨尚殷、其再接再厲之形勢、一時尚難休止、故市面之漲、亦不能砥定也、兼之內銷亦在發動、數雖有限、不無助其勢燄、聞浙桐之欠度者、亦須售每砠三十九元以外、已可見其物稀爲貴矣、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮青糖略有回好</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、雖值關金微鬆、趨勢仍緊、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨呌升一角、爲十六元七角、轉口貨呌五元一角、均未成交、本廠綿白、振裕一號昨十五元八角、已有成交、二號七角、三號五角半、四號四角、潮青號盤久乏做開、茲值轉機之候、稍有帶好、昨開二百餘包沖提荘九元九角半、黃崗青九元八角、隆青九元三角、次稍減比升角許、聞海南赤暗盤續有開出一千餘包、價乏上落、蓋貨品較爲普通故耳、</p>

<h3>兒童年與學生國貨年</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>拍手哈哈笑！今天是兒童年開幕的一天，許多小朋友，歡歡喜喜來歡迎這可愛可貴可慶可喜的兒童年，大家小腦子裏，當然有說不出的快樂。不過回過頭來，諸位小朋友，還不要忘記今年不但是兒童年，還是很可紀念很可寶重的學生國貨年。尤其是不要忘記中國兒童，應服用中國貨。記者凑了幾句不成文的短歌，來貢獻許多小朋友之前；</p>
<p>小朋友！愛國方法萬萬千，</p>
<p>愛用國貨最居先。</p>
<p>制止入超，挽回外溢金錢。</p>
<p>一大半的責任，在我們的小仔肩。</p>
<p>任他華麗美觀，不是國貨，我不愛憐。</p>
<p>任他時鬆漂亮，不是國貨，我不垂涎。</p>
<p>我愛國貨，我志極堅，</p>
<p>我用國貨，我心坦然。</p>
<p>我要勸人，我該走在人前。</p>
<p>猛着先鞭，保我利權。</p>
<p>下辜負這學生國貨年，</p>
<p>便對得起這可愛的兒童年。</p>
<p>小朋友！你看看各國的兒童，自小養成四不主義，到死遵守不失的。什麽四不呢？</p>
<p>非國貨不喫，</p>
<p>非國貨不穿，</p>
<p>非國貨不用，</p>
<p>非國貨不玩。</p>
<p>這是在他們小腦子裏，從小便有進偶思想，可說是與有生俱來。我們做父母的，固然要訓練小孩子有這種習憤，做小朋友的，更不可不從小養成這種觀念。正是「欲求國富民强日，孩子母忘國貨心」。</p>
<h3>學生國貨年與大學生</h3>
<p>— 若愚</p>
<p>一九二八年世界經濟發生恐慌，可說無遠弗屆的席捲了所有國家，迄今愈演愈烈的彌有底止。落後的與失去一切保障的中國，剛行發展不久的工商業，遭受到這種狂潮猛浪的襲擊，還那裏能支持住呢！所以近幾年來大量現金之外溢，眞是江河似的滔滔不息，眼看着國內雪白的銀子一天枯竭一天，以致弄得工商業凋弊，農村破產，使得全社會走到普遍窮困的境地。有識之士，看到這種危殆情形，覺得非根本上提倡國貨，實不足以救亡圖存，而今年之定爲國貨年，用以來作進一步的從學生做起，以期收獲成效，也就是這個原因了。良以今日之中國學生，受國人之一般的尊重，雖不必再能如往昔之一萬般皆下品，惟有讀書高」的年頭那麽崇貴，但今日之學生——特別是大學生，仍是國家之精英，其一言一動，無不可以轉移國人耳目，而領袖羣倫，依然是一確切事實。</p>
<p>因之，在現時學生國貨年當中，每一個學生——特別是大學生，應若何的秉承斯旨，脚踏實地的做去，以作爲國人之表率，然而事實上，今日之學生——特別是大學生，反多不能做到這個地步。平時的衣，食，住行，祗看到他們是西裝革履一味的使用外貨，恰恰弄到相反的情形。這眞是一伴痛心的事。我說這話，絕非無中生有，而故造謠言，以聳人觀聽。因爲我最近看到一個大學敎授，我問到他今日的大學生生活如何？他趕卽搖着頭說：是每况愈下的簡直不願多讀書，祇想混個資格，找個出路便算完了。當其剛從鄉村出來考進學校時，還能很刻苦的讀書，老布長衫也可穿着。但不過三月，則無不西其裝，革其履，司丹康塗滿頭髮了。至於讀書，更是與時俱進的味淡下去。有的且或足尖不離舞塲與終日追求女性。我聽這話後，眞有點惘然了！同時又聯想到今年是學生國貨年，所以於不知覺間便寫了這麽一段話，用以揭示於國人——特別大學生，最好是能「有則改之，無則加勉。」而對於目前的中國現狀，還能仰觀俯察的仔細深思一番，在日常生活上，服用上，去作如何的儘量採用國貨，以爲國人倡。庶纔不有負這個學生國貨年的喲！</p>
<h3>「國貨統制」的我見</h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>「產業統制」，「經濟統制」的呼聲，在最近來又甚囂塵上，自上月本市市商會和國貨大同盟會連呈中央，請實施國貨統制後，接着又有樹膠業的自動請求政府統制的呈文，在黯澹的國貨前途，有許多人却已集中在國貨的統制，去謀打開出路，雖然照一般人的議論，仁者見仁，智者見智，對於國貨統制的毁譽，還是紛紛不一，但大家對實施國貨統制的研討，却無疑地起一致的重視，在這裏，因此我也，敢稍申一些管見。</p>
<p>目下一般人對於中國當前是否要實施國貨統制，大都抱着很懷疑的態度，他們以爲我國是一個生產落後的國家，所以恐怕國貨施行統制後，會影響到萌芽時代的新工業的不能自由發展，而在華外廠，因有特殊關係，反得擴展起來，這一點，確是値得我們深加研討的。</p>
<p>不過，我們要曉得國貨統制的最大目的，並不是單要在生產和消費上，完成國貨的自給自足，並且更要在交換上，完成對外貿易的發展，和反對洋貨傾銷政策，促進國貨運動尖銳化，所以，以我的意見，假定國貨統制能在「以計劃的國貨生產，」和「國貨的自給自足」這兩個原則下進行，那是十分正確的動向，現在我就寫出我的二個實施辦法來：</p>
<p>一，積極的統制；舉凡一切須仰給外人的原料和製造品，必須於一個嚴密的計劃下，限制集中全國人民的財力，來完成經濟的自給自足。</p>
<p>二，消極的統制：一般已在生長着的國貨新工業，年來因自由競爭太烈，斵傷殊甚，現在須用國家的力量，去施行生產的統制，就現在的狀態，規定各業各廠的生產量和標準價格，並限止新廠漫無秩序的產生，使調整和穩定現實的國貨界基礎。</p>
<p>總之，我很肯定的認爲要實施國貨統制，務須切實的注意，第一要計劃的規定生產，使生產數量適應消費數量，常保持均衡的狀態，第二調劑國貨生產品的流動，規定市價，以達到分配社會化，卽對於同業競爭，也務給以合理的控制，第三努力促進開拓國外市塲，同時阻止外貨在華傾銷，本國境內的外廠，也都應由政府予以制裁及取締，這樣，我想黑暗籠罩着的當前國貨工業，纔有抬頭的餘地呵！</p>
<h3>毅廬漫筆</h3>
<p>— 徐幹</p>
<p>「國貨」這二個字，未被人拉在一起成爲一個名詞的時候，我疑心中國是一樣貨物都沒有出產的，是一個十十足足的無貨之國。</p>
<p>中國人用中國貨，要大吹大擂的提倡，勸吿，這眞是世界上罕聞的滑稽大奇事。</p>
<p>「提倡國貨」，要規定「婦女國貨年」「學生國貨年」，一年年努力地作一種有效的運動，這也是煞費苦心的辦法，然而已非常的引人驚嘆了，而所謂努力運動的結果，却又等於零，那還有話說嗎？</p>
<p>賣洋貨的人說：「倘然無人來買，我當然也就不賣了」買洋貨的人說：「倘然無人售賣，我自然不會買的」，一樣是絕頂聽敏的回答，但中國就壞在這些聰敏人太多了。</p>
<p>國貨產商都痛恨國家人民的不知撫助愛護，使國貨廠商不能和外商競爭，而一般的人們又怨恨國貨廠商的出品，不能如外貨的價廉物美，使人不得不購用外貨，這種矛盾的現狀，我願雙方都打破主觀的立塲互相諒解才好。</p>
<p>一個時髦的口號，給愛出風頭的一陣子大喊大叫，過了些時，便不知不覺的變了老生長譚起初時雖然有人當作新歌曲聽，到後來聽的也聽怨了，自然唱的也就自己覺得减興了。</p>
<p>中國因入超的增加，金錢外溢，以致國訐民生日見窮蹙，但總有一天窮蹙到購買力完全盡絕時，我想入超也定會减少吧？</p>
<h3>新中工程公司參觀記</h3>
<p>— 黃鍵</p>
<p>新中位閘北寶昌路嚴家閣，一二八戰前，資本額計二十五萬，上海事發，閘北幾於燬滅。幸該廠職工於事前，將重要機器，悉行搬出，雖房屋等損失尚小，而戰後復興，資本只十五萬耳，言之曷勝痛心！</p>
<p>循廠長魏如君之約，於翌日上午八時至該廠，承親爲領導，首至裝配間，內有已竣工之柴油引擎，竣工而未噴漆者，尚未裝配者，約二十餘架之多，動力數自十匹至七十五匹不等，承將已竣工之一架，當塲試騐，成績極佳，詢之用油量，則每小時僅三磅，較之外貨過無不及。惟因震動甚烈，只宜用於有堅固底脚之處，如欲携帶作托動抽水機，則不宜矣。</p>
<p>次至工作間，途經抽水機試騐池，方可二丈許，其時正試騐一口徑十四吋之螺旋式抽水機，以十六匹馬力電動機推動之，每小時可出水四千五百加侖。以之抽送汚水，而地面差不鉅者，更屬合算，或以相當馬力之柴油引擎托動之，尤適於我國內地之用，其時但見巨流由管中奔出，潺潺然若科學向人力示威者焉。</p>
<p>抵工作間，諸如鑽床，刨床，洗床，羅列滿目，其時只三四人電銲氣缸，一人立大刨床上修整抽水機殼，蓋廠中爲眷念工人辛苦，是日循例放假故也，餘惟裝箱待運之引擎數架，視之運往雲南等處者。</p>
<p>轉趨翻沙間，有翻沙機一，熔鐵爐二，工具盡各置一處，與木工間同因例假無工，未作何細玩，只於窗際一窺，見其中模形壘壘，盡屬零件翻沙之用。</p>
<p>再前爲曠地一方·魏君言：「方着手建一汽車引擎研究間·俟落成後，開始工作，備竭同人等微力，有以國貨汽車引擎問世也。」聞言益深欽佩。該廠於種種困難狀態之下，作艱苦之掙扎，深願同胞共勉，國貨或不爲外來勢力所摧殘歟！</p>
<p>廠之南爲大料裝配地，備聯結鐵橋水塔等用，杭江路金華鐵橋卽該廠所承造，他如江蘇雲南陝西等處，推銷甚廣，余願其出品與日俱增，亦所以慶國貨前途之愈形光明也。</p>
<h3>國貨界應注意的二點</h3>
<p>— （趙士鐸）</p>
<p>在此提倡國貨救國之聲，囂嘩全國的時候，余希望一般國貨廠商。對提倡國貨，能從大處着想，小處着手。因爲余感到有幾家廠商，太忽視小處，太洋化，太矛盾了。最顯明的，就是每一種國貨，所裝璜的盒子及說明書，等有時且印上兩句中國人應用中國貨的標語，但是考究考究其所用的盒紙，却都是外國貨居多，余不過略舉一二，其他種種，眞是不勝枚舉。似應改革的。還有希望每一家廠商的經理先生，能以身作則，監視下面的職工，一律服用國貨，遇到穿非國貨的，則應予以相當懲戒，以重威信，此二點，余想是急應改革而實行的。（却酬）</p>

<p>從洋酒的大量輸入，不禁使我們記起紹興老酒。現在把我所知道的，寫在下面：</p>
<p>紹酒之所以醇美，可以說完全是由于水的關係。紹興酒作坊所用以釀酒的水，差不多都取之於鑑湖，這水含鹽，燐酸，鐵，等成分極少，其硬性只有二·四左右，極適合於釀造酒類。</p>
<p>釀酒的原料，自糯米，麥麯，和酒藥。糯米大都購自無錫，丹陽一帶。酒藥分二種：一種是白藥，來自寗波；一種是黑藥，來自富陽。麥麯則極少來自外縣，多用本地製造者。</p>
<p>釀酒的方法，也有二種：一種是攤飯，一種是淋飯。因爲用攤飯方法釀成的酒，此較得耐久一點，所以多採用這一種。</p>
<p>酒家多在近鑑湖一帶，尤集中於阮社，及西郭附　，總數約有一千八百餘家，其中最着名者，當推沈永和，章東明，及王友梅等。沈永和發明以酒代水，釀成善釀酒，味頗甜美。</p>
<p>紹酒之銷於本地者，曰本莊；銷於外埠者，曰路莊。路莊酒多從寗波，杭州，及上海一帶，轉運至珠江，長江，黃河流域；間有運銷外洋，如南洋羣島，及印度等地。亦不在少數。</p>
<p>有二三千年的歷史，年產十萬八千餘缸的產額，紹酒的範圍，也不能算是小了；但終於抵制不住外酒的　入，其最大原因，在對釀造者之墨守舊規，不加改進，二千年前的釀造方法，與目前所應用，實無十分差別，深願紹酒業同人，留意及之。同時，更希望政府能减輕稅額，使其得與洋酒，自由競爭，以挽回金錢之外溢。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨手冊的我見</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>簽名手姍，盛行一時，雪泥鴻爪，留爲日後紀念，彌足珍貴！</p>
<p>古之孝子，以保存父母口澤所遺器皿爲珍物，今之情侶，以留得愛人墨蹟爲可貴！最近周旋社交者，鑒於交換名刺之麻煩，且易散落遺忘！於是競尚簽名手册，名流，要人，影后，校花，包羅禺象！可稱「册中自有黃金屋」「冊中自有顏如玉」者矣！</p>
<p>惜精美，富麗的手冊，都爲舶來品！國貨製造之手冊，絕無僅有，以用者之廣，漏巵當亦可觀！</p>
<p>余意國貨手冊，顯及時興起，希望江南，天章等造紙廠積極籌劃，如潔白之江南連史，中襯以國貨報紙，使在前後同頁上簽名，不致透濕！封面糊以美亞廠出品之綢，五光十色，當極可觀！稍挽漏巵！勿以利少而不爲也！</p>
<p>記者更希望名流，要人，影星，校花，曁一般社交人物，如遇非國貨簽名手冊，切勿輕於落筆，我敬以十二萬分的誠意盼禱！</p>
<p>一週間國貨新訊</p>

<h3>兒童年開幕致辭</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>今天是兒童年開幕之日，實在是小朋友們最可紀念的一日，我以春秋兒童周刊編者的資格，得向小朋友們說幾句至　的話。</p>
<p>小朋友要知道那些主持敎育而訂定這兒童年的人，大半是中年人或老年人了；那麽他們為甚麽不來一個中年人年或老年人年，而偏要定出這兒童年來呢？喏！這都為的是愛重你們小朋友的緣故。小朋友們也該愛重你們自己，更愛重你們的祖國。</p>
<p>怎樣的愛重你們自己呢？就是去除惡習慣，奉行新生活；在家遵守父母的命令，在校聽從師長的訓誨；隨時努力，以增進你們的智識，培養你們的德性，鍜鍊你們的體格，在目前做一箇敦品立行的小學生，在將來做一箇福國利民的大人物。</p>
<p>怎樣的愛重你們的祖國呢？就是要認識自己與祖國的關係，而啟發愛國的思想；不要以為自己年幼，而放棄了救國的工作。第一步以提倡國貨救國：要喫國貨的糖果糕餅，要用國貨的文具玩物，要穿著國貨的衣服鞋帽，不但自己要用國貨，幷且要勸別人用國貨；多用一件國貨，就是給祖國多一分元氣，第二步以注意科學救國：要知道世界中每一國家的富强，全靠著科學的力量，科學落後的國家，將不能立足於今後的世界。所以你們應將全副精神，都放在科學上面，在小學時代，先將算學自然常識諸課，打下了科學的基礎，將來進中學進大學，就得以全心力著在物理化學諸科，隨時作學理研究，隨處作實地試騐。將來發明新事物，開闢新富源，造福民衆，充實國防，救國之道，無過於此。</p>
<p>小朋友，今天是兒童年的第一日，就請你們從今天起，腳踏實地的做去。</p>
<h3>嬰兒乎？老人乎？</h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>現代的中國可算是個龍鐘老人，雖然他還掙扎著要想返老還童。可是被特殊的環境束縛着，不許你睜眼開口。</p>
<p>現代的中國也可算是個乳臭嬰兒，有些不懷好意的婦人們爭著來當我們的保姆。扯着伊胸口的肥乳來强迫喂你，要叫你「似我！似我！」不許你離手學步。</p>
<p>我們究竟要做什麽？</p>
<p>我們决不願做靜候死神光降的龍鍾老人；我們也决不甘心永遠做個聽人擺佈的乳臭嬰兒。我們當然要做個活潑壯建自由自主的有為少年。</p>
<p>南宋時代的愛國詩人陸放翁有首詩：「自昔英雄有屈伸，危機變化亦逡巡。陰平窮寇非難禦，如此江山坐付人？」</p>
<p>我們是否能把這錦繡江山坐付與外人呢？</p>
<p>不能！便是四萬萬人死個乾凈也還是不能！</p>
<p>中國的兒童們！中國的兒童年！</p>
<p>莫做龍鍾老，死滅在眼前；</p>
<p>莫甘乳臭兒，哭笑受人憐；</p>
<p>要做個活潑壯健自由自主的有為少年！</p>
<h3>兒童年裏的好兒童</h3>
<p>— 以德</p>
<p>小朋友！從今天開始的一年，是你們的一年，是你們特別快樂的一年，是你們享受幸福的一年。你們看，官署為你們開放，商店為你門廉價，人人為你們慶祝……整個的社會，都在為你們辛苦；為你們忙碌，總說一句，他們都在為你們謀幸福。</p>
<p>但你們可曾想過，從今天起，應該怎樣做一個好兒童，以報答社會的盛意，使社會更看重你們，更希望你們呢？</p>
<p>所謂好兒童，並不是規行矩步的算好兒童，也不是讀書用功的算好兒童。你們應該要認淸楚：我們的國家，是國難緊急的國家，現在的世界，是弱肉强食的世界。我們應該養成一種特有的眞精神，才算是一個好兒童。</p>
<p>怎樣才算得好兒童呢？我以為第一，要有自强不息的精神，我們必須經過理智的裁判，對於合理的，要竭誠擁護，對於不合理的，就起來對抗。這種可貴的精神，應在平時加意培養才對。第二，要有犧牲的精神：要對抗，就難免犧牲；怕犧牲，就不配對抗。只要有利於公衆的事，我們就得努力去做，犧牲金錢，犧牲幸福，甚至犧牲性命，也不可惜。否則，沒有犧牲的精神，做起事來，就有多方的顧慮，有了多方的顧慮，就不能達到成功的目的了。所謂犧牲，也要有代價，如僅為個人的利害而犧牲，那是毫不足取的。</p>
<p>小朋友！這兩種精神，是我們最缺少的，但為我們最急需的。就從今天起，請你們多多養成了這兩種眞精神，再去做將來國家的主人翁。今日的好兒童，才是將來的好主人翁呢。</p>

<h3>兒童年與現代父母</h3>
<p>— 黃寄萍</p>
<p>國定兒童年，今天開幕了。但我們應當切記，不是今天慶祝就算完了，也不是說在這一年中，全國人民都注意兒童的敎養問題，過了這一年就算完了的。須知從今兒童年之後，為師長的，尤其為現代父母的人，就要幾歲年年，時時刻刻，都要為兒童的敎養着想，為兒童的幸福着想，簡括的說：（一）兒童日常的生活，「衣」「食」「住」「行」，完全依賴父母的供給，（二）兒童平時的修養，「智」「德」「體」「群」「美」，尤其需要父母的指導：可見為現代父母者的責任，眞是萬分重大，簡直一刻不能放鬆，一些不能忽略的。回想過去一般為父母的，也曾注意到這些問題的麼？歷史上吿訴我們的，如朱柏唐先生，曾文正公，如孟母，岳母，可算最光耀的父敎與母敎：但普通一般人，不論是父是母，只着重兒童的「養」——衣食飽暖，並未研究到「敎」——、德智體方面。所以我們追念過去，認為未盡家庭敎育的能事：推想未來，絕對不能長此忽略；兒童年以後的父母，除了物質供養兒童之外，又加一層精神敎導的功夫，而且後者比前者更是重要得多多呢。</p>
<p>在我們中國，不論城市與鄕村，家庭與學校，有合理化的兒童敎養方法與設備，能作為標準，値得大家模仿的，可以說很少發現，那末只好把別人家的事實，給大家作為參考吧。號稱物質文明的英，美，德，法，意，日，俄，各國，上自政府，下至細民，在他們的社會組織裏，對於兒童問題，都有相當完備的設施。卽使流浪的苦兒，（包括孤獨，殘廢，貧苦等兒童）也處理得井井有條，不像我國流浪兒終年過着地獄的非人生活，這就値得研究的。但看英國的情形：「英國是兒童的王國」日本某敎育家已經這樣說過。眞的，英國的一切社會生活，都是以兒童為中心的。假如走到倫敦的書店裏面，便可看見堆積如山的兒童讀物，一般人到了書店，總是買幾本兒童書籍給子女，或是購贈親友的小孩。倫敦市民，對於兒童都非常愛護，也很尊重兒童的人格。卽在貧窮的家庭裏面，也會有一個兒童的房間，這是神聖區域，兒童成為眞正的主權者。當然那裏便是兒童的王國，大人走入王國裏面，須十分尊敬和嚴肅。倫敦的家庭，大半都有一個小的庭園，兒童遊戲的器具，是不會缺少的。又因倫敦老是烟霧　濛，妨害兒童的身體發育，於是許多人想移居郊外，使兒童盡其可能地接近自然境界，這當然是愛護兒童的心理之反映。英國兒童之母親，為着子女成為英國民族的繼承者起見，都不辭勞苦的，使子女鍜鍊於風霜雨雪之中，希望他們在北極的冰島之上，也能榭起大英帝國的旗幟。英國的政府社會，家庭，如此周到的為兒童造福，的確使我們感動，在現實的我國，要是模仿他們，自然不是容易的。但依我主張，此後的父母，萬不能給子女豐衣足食，養成他們養尊處優的惡習；任意放縱，漸入驕奢淫佚的歧路。必須依照「孝悌忠信，禮義廉恥」的古訓，使子女於「德」「智」「體」「羣」「美」五育方面，下一番苦練的功夫，希望未來的主人翁，來改造衰微的中國！</p>

<h3>科學先生變戲法</h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>——白紙上燒出字畫——</p>
<p>兒童年開幕了」科學先生也來參加慶祝。看啊！他上台了，他同他的助手携着兩介很大的白紙圈上臺了。</p>
<p>這時臺的中央放着兩隻椅子，他們把這兩個白紙圈擱在椅子靠背上。</p>
<p>「諸位小朋友，」科學先生向臺下鞠了躬之後說：「今天是兒童年開幕的一天，我希望全中國的小朋友因爲得到社會的帮助，和靠着自已的努力，而造成一個新兒童——有强健的身體；科學的頭腦；會做工的雙手的新兒童。我今天在戲法裏，也表示一點慶祝和勉勵的意思罷。」</p>
<p>他說罷就叫助手從後　取了二根香來，用火點着了，各人分執一根，他接着說道：</p>
<p>果然，科學先生和助手用香把紙的上端一點，紙便燒着了，而且使人更吃驚的是，那火會在紙上蜿　的走動，不多一會，一個「慶」字顯出來了，又一會，一個「祝」字顯出來了，不到片刻，「慶祝兒童年」五個字完全擺在小朋友們的眼前了。</p>
<p>另一個白紙圈上，最初顯出的，好像是一個人的頭頂的樣子，後來眉毛現出來了，眼睛，耳朶，鼻子，嘴吧陸續顯出來了，原來是一個微含笑容的孩子的半身像啊！</p>
<p>臺下的小朋友們看得有趣，連連鼓起掌來。</p>
<p>「小朋友，你們覺得這套戲法有趣麼？你們願意試試麽？學校或家庭開什麼慶祝會或紀念會的時候，表演這套戲法是很適宜的。材料是只須三樣東西：（一）硝酸鉀（藥房裏有得買）的溶液，（要濃一些才好）（二）厚一些的白紙，（三）鋼筆。</p>
<p>「材料預備好了，就用鋼筆蘸着溶液，在白紙上寫了字，或畫了畫，把牠陰乾，白紙便一點痕跡也沒有了。不過要在起筆的地方，預先做好一個暗記，免得到了表演的時候，不知從什麽地方點起頭。</p>
<p>「表演時，用燒着的香從做着記號的地方點起，碰着筆劃有隔斷的地方，仍用香點起，所以香是應該始終握在手裏的。——最好是從頭到尾用一筆畫成，中間沒有隔斷，那末就可以一直從頭燒到尾，不必再用香去點了。」</p>
<h3>兒童年與航空</h3>
<p>— 韻華</p>
<p>兒童年！兒童年！是我們的幸福年，也是我們的努力年！慈兒正在拍手唱這支歌的時候，忽然聽得天空軋軋的饗聲，抬頭一望，原來是飛機散放慶祝兒童年的五彩傳單；這時他跳躍若狂，內心有說不盡的愉快。恰巧給他的李老師看見，喊一聲：「王慈！你爲什麽這樣高與？」「噢！老師！我看那飛機散放傳單，爲我們兒童慶祝，所以分外高興。」那好了，停一會舉行慶祝兒童年開幕大會，我要你講個航空故事給大家聽。慈兒一想，這倒有些難爲了，但是，老師的命令，豈敢違抗，因此他沉思了許久。</p>
<p>慶祝會開得很熱烈，有校長致開會詞，有來賓演說，有各級同學的歌舞，音樂，體育等表演，最後有一節兒童演說，李老師便介紹王慈講航空故事，全塲掌聲四起，王慈在人叢中走上講臺，態度很莊重，行了一個九十度的鞠躬醴，從容的說道：</p>
<p>「校長，各位老師，各位同學，今天兒童年開幕，我不說關於兒童本身的話，而講航空故事，似乎牛頭不對馬嘴，請老師們，特別原諒！我國航空事業很幼稚，很落後，已往好像沒有什麼故事可講，我想報吿兩件國際的航空新聞，也許諸同學還不曾注意到的。（一）法國有一位聰明的木匠，名叫米宜安，費了多年的心血造成別出心裁的飛機，構造簡單，完成後命名命「飛虱」，預算一年內可造一萬架之多，法國人現正大宣傳「飛虱」的功能。（一）意大利和阿比西亞兩國備戰已久，血戰恐難倖免，最近意國航空隊已出動，首相墨索里尼的公子，長年十九歲，次年十七歲，自願入伍，為國捐軀，首相大為稱贊，允許他兄弟二人任征阿的先鋒。我們雖不同情這種恃強凌弱的勾當，但他們年少志高，勇敢愛國的精神，可以做我們的模範！</p>
<p>諸位同學！在我們這個隊伍裏，要如說將來沒有像法國的木匠，意相的公子那樣的人才，我就不相信；如其眞沒有的話，那我們都是中華民國的罪人！」</p>
<p>王慈話還沒講完，台下已掌聲如雷，大家對他行個很隆重的敬禮。</p>
<p>兒童書局慶祝兒童年紀念刊</p>
<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 張一渠</p>
<p>兒童——這是一個可愛的天眞的、充滿着一切的安慰與希望的生物的名詞。可是自有史以來，他們就被成人們壓迫着蔑視着，以爲他們是個只會吃只會享受，不會獨立生活的「成人縮影」。直到二十世紀以來，成人們纔覺悟，纔一變從前壓迫兒童蔑視兒意的錯誤觀念而爲愛護兒童尊重兒童：知道兒童是　組織社會的重　新份子，不是具體而微的成人；現在雖然不能直接參加種種的社會活動，但當他們的生理心理發育至相當程序時，他們也是社會活動的要角。這眞是人類史上最値得慶幸的事。</p>
<p>今年爲國定兒童年，又適値兒童書局成立五週紀念，所以從現在起，我們敢竭誠地跟蹤着爲兒童的父母教師和社會諸人士們，天天認識兒童，引導兒量，希望兒童，供給兒童們必需的新知識；使全國的兒童們，具備着：健康的體魄，創設的能力，服務社會的精神；使全國兒童都成爲新兒量。這也就是我們發刊的一點意思。</p>
<p>但是兒童書局是個好像剛五週歲的孩子，能力還很薄弱，一切進行還望海內外教育者加以教正提攜！</p>

<p>— 陶行知</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>大家來過年！大家來過年！過的什麽年？過的兒童年。你不要快樂，想一想那個孩子不能過年？流浪的孩子不能過年。沒有飯吃，沒有衣穿，沒有工做，沒有書念。霹拍一聲，是巡捕的皮鞭。要這樣的孩子能過年，才算是快樂的兒童年。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>大家來過年！大家來過年！過的什麽年？過的兒童年。你不要快樂，想一想那個孩子不能過年？奶媽的孩子不能過年。沒有奶吃，不知糖甜。你胖如東瓜，他瘦得可憐：追本推原，只因少幾文錢。要這樣的孩子能過年，才算是快樂的兒童年。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>大家來過年！大家來過年！過的什麼年？過的兒童年。你不要快樂，想　一想那個孩子不能過年？拐去的孩子不能過年？離開家裏，拐到天邊。不許啼哭，不許談天。一生一世，那裏尋得爹爹？要這樣的孩子過得年，才算是快樂的兒童年。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>大家來過年！大家來過年！過的什麼年？過的兒童年。你不要快樂，想一想那個孩子不能過年？做工的孩子不能過年。整天煤煙，幾文工錢，一不小心，軋掉指尖，死去活來，有誰代他伸寃？要這樣的孩子過得年，才算是快樂的兒童年。</p>

<h3>兒童讀物上的五大問題</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>——編　，選擇，利用，指導，攷查——</p>
<p>兒童讀物，是兒童知識上的食糧。沒有食糧，會餓壞了肚子！沒有適宜的食糧，也會吃壞了肚……</p>
<p>要使兒童讀物成爲兒童知識上適宜的食糧，幷能消化自如，就需要把五個問題來解决，那便是「兒童讀物的編撰」、「兒童讀物的選擇」、「兒童讀物的利用」和「兒童閱讀的指導」、「兒童閱讀的攷查」。</p>
<p>兒量讀物的編撰，是研究兒童讀物中最重要的問題，無論是材料的選擇，文字的組織，體裁的編制，在在足以影響及於讀物的整個功能。——怎樣編撰完全適宜於兒童的讀物？這，我們該期望於作者和書肆。</p>
<p>兒童讀物的選擇，是因爲第一個編撰問題沒有完全解决才產生的，同時也因爲除了內容的編撰以外，還有紙張、字體、印刷、裝釘等種種問題，未必能盡合我們的理想，所以在購置兒童讀物的時候，還需要經過一番選擇的工夫。——怎樣選擇完全適宜於兒量的讀物？這，我們該期望於學校、家庭以及負有發行責任的書肆。</p>
<p>兒童讀物的利用，也是兒童讀物上的重要問題。因爲兒童讀物是教育上的一種工具，要這種工具表現其功能，必須有相當的利用方法，正如一種銳利的武器，在武器的本身，是有偉大的功能。可是要這武器把偉大的功能表現出來，第一要懂得運用的方法，否則武器的本身，根本是一件死的東西，决不會自己發揮出偉大的功能來。——怎樣利用兒童讀物？這，我們該期望於負有指導兒童責任的敎師及父母。</p>
<p>兒童閱讀的指導，是謀增進兒童閱讀效能上的重要問題。所謂指導，當然不是一字一字的教，一句一句的講，只要對子閱讀的方法，作精詳的指示，對于讀物的內容，作槪括的提示，使兒童不致茫無適從。——怎樣給兒童以合理的指導？這，我們又該期望於應負責任的教師和父母。</p>
<p>兒童閱讀的玫查，是最後一步診斷效率的手續。教育上無論那一種設施，求的是效率：指導兒童閱讀，旣是教育上的一種設施，在我們實施以後，當然要加以診斷，一方面攷察兒童閱讀的能力，一方面又可以測量自己指導方法的是否合度，作以後改進的根據。——怎樣給兒童以合理的攷查？這，我們又該期望於應負責任的教師和父母。</p>
<p>總之，要改進兒童讀物以增進兒童閱讀的效能，該從各方面共同努力，方克有濟。</p>
<h3>蒙養心</h3>
<p>— 汪兆銘題</p>
<h3>有功蒙教</h3>
<p>— 王士杰題</p>
<h3>由兒童年說到父母教育</h3>
<p>— 梁士杰</p>
<p>兒童是最可愛最可尊重的，他們將來的造就，比較任何成人來得遠大，來得有希望，今年八月一日起至明年七月卅一日止爲國定兒童年，這就是國家尊重兒童希望兒童的意思。</p>
<p>我們尊重兒童希望兒童，就要給兒童以良好的教育。可是兒童一生的品格，性情，大都於幼小時就受到父母的影響。蝸遜（JohnB．Watsou）曾說：「觀察了幾百個嬰兒以後，我們相信一個人的未來模型，已於滿足二歲的時候養成。……兒童將來有沒有高尚的品格？是不是儒弱者？有沒有許多的懼怕？有沒有暴燥的脾氣？是富於感情者抑缺乏感情者？……等問題，在生下第二年己經決定了。」由這段話可知道要尊重兒童希望兒童，應先注意父母教育。</p>
<p>美國是先進國，他們對於父母教育的推行，不遺餘力，他們有：（1）預備式的父母教育——把「父母教育」編列在中小學，大學及補習學校的課程中，使一般未結婚的靑年男女，都受到「父母教育」的訓練：（2）補習式的父母教育——在全國各地的公立的，私立的、教育的、慈善的、宗教的、學術的等團體機關中，組織父母教育兒童教育研究會，或設立父母教育訓練班，或派員探訪家庭間教育兒童的狀况，或編印兒童教育的小册子，以費宣傳。囘顧我們中國「父母教育」的廢弛，令人不禁啞然。斯賓塞說：「兒童的生存死亡成就毀敗，都依賴着父母的教養。而現有的教育，對於將爲兒童的父母的人，和兒童教育的方法，竟一字不提，這不是一椿奇事嗎？他們把兒童一生的命運，完全交給了盲目的風俗，與成情的街動，再參加愚蠢的乳母的意見或頑固的祖母的主張，這又不是一件怪謬的事情嗎？」這些話正針對着我們中國舊式家庭教育的弊端。願全國慈幼機關、學術團體，乘這兒童年的時機，對於「父母教育」起而作大規模的提倡推行；更望父母們對於兒童教養法加以研究！</p>
<h3>今日的兒童讀物</h3>
<p>— 陳伯吹</p>
<p>「兒童年」的意義：直接地說，增進兒盡的幸福和康健；間接地說，强化民族復興的動力。但是怎樣完成這重大的意號，簡捷地說，唯有兒童教育！</p>
<p>兒童教育是多方面的，但以我編輯的立場上說，是這樣：</p>
<p>John　Dewey說“Education　is　Life”根據這一個教育原則，我們應該多多出版關於兒童生活的書；兒童的好奇心與求知心，特別發達，他們要求充實經驗，認識事物，對於自然故事，動物故事，生活故事等，非常需要，我們應該設法滿足他們。</p>
<p>教育家和心理家都一致承認“Learningbydoing”by　doing”在這一方面的出版物，兒童書局做得最有點成績，一百零一册的兒童科學叢書，都是一些最簡易的科學把戲，是一種逗人趣味的小實驗，可能的話，我們應該再多出版一些。但家庭裏的父母，學校裏的教師，應該怎麼去輔導兒童自學呀！</p>
<p>今後的世界，是科學的世界，神學的、玄學的時期都過去了！廿世紀的兒童，應該是科學的兒童，所以他們的讀物也應該是不違反自然現象；且使他們瞭解自然現象與勢力，進而指示他們怎樣征服自然。負着兒童文化事業，教育事業的兒童書局，它的出版方針準對着這個方向，所以低級常識叢書，兒童活葉常識，我們的中心活動等叢書，繼續兒童科學叢書而出版了。</p>
<p>Aristotal說：「人是政治的動物」。不錯，嬰兒一生下來，卽受法律的保護，在社會有了地位。所以今日的兒量」不僅是裝滿了科學智識的小獃子，他們必須具有一點社會智識的頭腦，才不致用智識坑害人。在這方面，兒童書局也已出版了兒童社會叢書，兒童新史地叢書，衛國健兒叢書，中國名人</p>
<p>篇幅有限，不能暢說，敬請讀者指教！</p>
<h3>兒童年對兒童們進一言</h3>
<p>— 馬靜軒</p>
<p>——用功讀書</p>
<p>兒童年開幕了這一年，完全是你們兒童的了！你們看：全國各處都組織了兒童保護恊會，研究兒童教養和保障的方法；各報紙各雜誌，都出版兒童週刊或兒童研究論文；各機關各團體各家庭都在爲兒童們謀幸福，都想在兒童年裏，爲兒童們做些事情。但是，兒童，是國家的主人翁，負有救國的責任，我要對兒童們進一言：從現在起，應該「用功讀書」！因爲用功讀書，就是救國。</p>
<p>兒童書局，是供給兒童良好讀物的書局，在過去　年間，出版兒童讀物，約八九百種。今年是兒量年，兒童書局自然也要做些事情，便分幼稚園小學初中高三組，分編三套叢書：卽低級兒童常識叢書，我們的中心活動，兒童半角叢書這三套叢書和以前出版的八九百種兒童讀物，都是兒童教育專家編輯的，全國教育家公認爲良好的兒童讀物。</p>
<p>希望兒童們自動的用功讀書，自動的選擇良好的書讀：從良好的讀物中，獲得良好的知識，將來長大起來，擔任救國工作，國家便可變弱爲强了。</p>
<p>「諸位小朋友，這兩個白紙糊成的圈，上面一點痕跡也沒有，不是麼？但是你們看着：等我們用香把它點燒，它們上面便會顯出字和畫來。」</p>
<p>臺下小朋友們聽說白紙圈上一經用香點着，便會顯出字畫來，覺得非常有趣，便一個個提起精神看着。</p>
<h3>應時的兒童科學</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>今天是兒童年開幕日，到處開慶祝會演講兒童問題，到處播送兒童節目，趁這個時節來研究科學中「聲」的問題，决不是沒有意義的事。</p>
<p>在沒有談到原理以前，我們可以先做幾個小試騐玩玩，在試騐中也許就會懂得，什　是聲了。你站在池邊，或則水缸邊，用手把池水或缸水拍起幾個水浪，這水浪就會漸漸的漸漸的向前行進着，可是當這水浪碰着缸邊或池邊的時候，這水浪就立刻回返過來，（圖一）我們就可以明白聲的成功是空氣因着我們發聲或震動而發生波浪，像你用手撥水一樣。所以聲的進行，和水浪相彷彿的。所以演講臺的上面或後面有的裝着饗板，就是利用這種作用的，使演講者的聲浪。達到響板時，聲浪就會反射下來，達到聽衆的耳鼓中，而且會得更響亮些。有的用報吿話筒，在廣大的會塲中報吿一切說話。（圖二）原理也和上面說過的一樣。聲浪碰到話筒的邊沿，反射下來，和原來發出的聲浪混合，使聲浪更響亮的傳達到聽衆的耳鼓裏。</p>
<p>聲浪進行的情形，在上面已經說過了。但是，除了空氣，就是固體的東西，也可以傳達聲浪，而且比較空氣爲速。你玩過用火柴盒做的電話機嗎？（圖三）用紙把火柴盒的一端糊沒，穿過一根細綫，同樣做兩隻，就可以拿來打電話了。不過要注意的，綫必須拉緊，否則綫在空氣中擺動，妨碍聲浪的進行，話也聽不淸楚了。</p>
<p>我們還可以玩一個另外的試騐，你把兩手掩着耳，敎另外一個人用麻繩繞着你的頭和手，再敎他用一隻手拉住繩的兩端，拉得緊緊的，而用另一隻手的手指：輕輕地在繩上擦着，（圖四）那你就會聽到一種極大的聲浪在響着，像雷響一樣。這個試騐，也是證明固體傳聲的實例。</p>
<p>過了幾個實騐以後，我們總可明白，聲是空氣振盪而成的波浪，他的進行和水波一樣，而且固體傳聲更速，幾個聲浪合一的時候，便更響亮了。</p>

<h3>兒童年中之精神建設</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>今之謀兒童福音，咸致力於物質事業之建設，在兒童事業十分衰落之中國，此固爲吾人應有之努力，顧所謂兒童事業之建設决非僅賴少數人提倡所能爲力，必也全國上下，人人具有慈幼之觀念，人人以慈幼為應盡之義務，通力合作，方克有濟。吾國兒童事業，雖經提倡有年，而迄今無若何建樹者，國人慈幼觀念薄弱，未能以慈幼為應盡之義務，對於兒童事業，未能盡扶植之責任耳。故於今日而欲謀兒童幸福之增進，於物質建設之外，猶應先謀精神建設之完成。</p>
<p>所謂精神建設者，一言以蔽之，提倡國人之慈幼觀念而已。而今而後，政府應以慈幼爲國家主要施政之一，以發展慈幼事業爲立國大計之首，國庫雖虛，慈幼應撥專欵，國難愈重，慈幼愈不可廢，以言國民，則應知兒童地位之重要，與國家民族之關係，以慈幼爲國民應盡之天職，有力者出力，有錢者出錢，於自顧子女之外，猶應兼及一般兒童，「幼吾幼，以及人之幼」，允宜奉爲圭臬，夫然後精神建設之意義乃克完成。</p>
<p>精神建設完成以後，則政府倡導於前，國民扶植於後，物質事業之建設，庶幾有豸。今日爲國定兒童年開幕之日，其郎精神建設之開始乎？企予望之！</p>
<h3>兒童年之感想</h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>中國古之治理，敎養兼施：育幼養老。夙所重視。誠以兒童有敏慧之天資，純潔之天良；活潑之天機；其智，其德，其體，均在成人之上，誠能教之養之，各得其方，自易蔚爲社會之長才，改進民族之質素。</p>
<p>近世各國政治革新之趨勢，對於人民生活之保育，備極注重；而於兒童生活，兒童權利，且予以憲法的保障。如戰後德國新憲，其顯例也。德憲第一二二條規定曰：『對於兒童之過勞，以及道德上，精神上，身體上之怠棄，當加以保護。聯邦，邦，公共團體，對此當爲必要之措置』。其次如一一九條及一二零條，又有關於家庭衛生，以及義務敎育之規定。至於各國勞動法典，對於兒童之保護，更爲周密，如工作年齡，工作時間，敎育程度。身體康健諸項，莫不於法律爲嚴密而特別的限制與愛護。</p>
<p>吾國先哲，對於兒童問題，初未漠視。如曰「男有分，女有歸，壯有所用，幼有所長，鰥寡孤獨疾廢者，皆有所養』，又曰「男有分，女有歸，壯有所用，幼吾幼，以及人之幼』，其愛護兒童，注意兒童之精神，概可想見。惜乎晚近以來，敎化廢弛，非但國家社會，漠視兒童；甚至身為父母長者，亦均不知，其敎養之責任。羣居終日，言不及義：行爲放浪，心身日壤。兒章爲將來民族之精魂，國家之基石，長此以往，不加注意，則其所貽民族國家之患，何堪設想。</p>
<p>茲値全國兒童年開幕之日，因就公餘，略布所感。深望今之從事於兒童運動者，對於兒童心理。兒童敎育，兒童思想，兒童習慣，兒童道德，兒童身體，兒章生活，兒童衛生，兒童一福利等，加以切實注意與研究，俾活潑，純潔，敏慧的無數兒童，均不致爲惡劣環境所腐化，而蔚爲國家社會之長才。則其有裨於我民族前途者，將無可限量矣！</p>
<h3>告全市兒童</h3>
<p>— 上海市兒童年實施委員會</p>
<p>可愛的全市小朋友們！</p>
<p>今天是全國兒童年開幕的一天，本會負着本市兒童年實施的職責，自然要趁着這個機會，和全市的小朋友們說幾句話。</p>
<p>我們中國定四月四日爲兒童節，從今天起至明年七月止又定爲兒童年，中央政府提倡於上，各省市推行於下，像這樣的注重兒童，是何等値得紀念的一樁事，尤其在這兒童年開慕的一天，是全年工作實施的開始，大家要如何欣歡鼓舞來慶祝這兒童福利的到來。</p>
<p>何况兒童年是創議於本市的中華慈幼協會，兒童年實施辦法又是擬訂於本市兒童幸福委員會？可見本市對淤兒童年，更有特殊意義的了。</p>
<p>「兒童爲民族的基礎，社會的繼承者，國家的柱石」這幾句話，人人知之，人人能言之。兒童在民族的地位，在社會的地位，在國家的地位，關係何等重大，同時也是兒童將來對民族的責任，對社會的責任，對國家的責任，何等重大！</p>
<p>我們覺得都市的兒童，因爲敎育機會的容易取得，和物質文明的濡染，環境戚化力量的偉大，其內在蘊伏的智識，往往優於內地一般的鄉村兒童，上海市爲吾國文化薈萃之區，係全世界六大　商埠之一，全市人口總數達三百五十三萬三千五百九十七人之多，（根據市公安局本年六月份統計）再以全市學齡兒童而論（特區待查）達十一萬零六百七十五人，（根據市敎育局二十二年度調查）推測全市的兒童總數，大槪不下八十萬人，其數量超過國內任何一個都市。在這偌大的社會裏包含着如許的兒童，我們希望全上海市的兒童，一致努力上進，將來爲全國各省市兒童的領導者！</p>
<p>兒童：不是家庭的私有物；乃是社會的民族的國家的一份子。今日的兒童，也就是將來爲社會民族國家負荷責任的一份子，所以家庭社會對於兒童的保育敎養，應該如何地注意，俾將來負起繼往開來的責任。</p>
<p>本會同人不敏，旣負着兒童年實施的職責，不得不兢兢業業地盡我們力量做去，我們擬有實施方案，大要在（一），督促社會注意兒童問題。（二）提倡兒童幸福事業。（三）改善兒童敎養。（四）努力於苦兒私生兒及低能兒童的救濟。同時促進一般兒童對於自身地位的覺悟：和瞭解吾國前途的困難。不過這種重大的責任，不是少數人能够勝任的，所以不得不希望全市民衆共同努力協助達到這個偉大的使命。</p>
<h3>中華慈幼恊會宣言</h3>
<p>今天是兒童年正式開幕的一天。全國方面，在林主席領導之下，各地有熱烈盛大的慶祝，上海方面，在吳市長領導之下，全市有優美雄壯的表現，一般的成人們，固然在注視兒童，表示親切的關懷，而所有的兒童們，更是在歡天喜地的，慶祝他們的第二生日。這眞是民國成立以來僅有的現象，在中國歷史上，値得大書特書的一筆。廻憶民國二十年三月七日，本會呈請規定兒童節之制度，二十二年十一月十五日，復呈請規定兒童年之制度，在事變紛乘，萬幾待理的情形之下，本會先後兩次的呈請，都蒙政府予以採納並頒行，這眞是叫我國萬分欽感，爲之振奮不已的。在賢明政府的領導提倡之下，再加上全國人民的努力奮鬥，我們相信：中國兒童的幸福，是沒有涯涘的，而中國民族的發展，更是沒有涯涘的。當前的沉悶的局面，固然令人愛心如擣；可是我們看到新興的一代快要起來，將追隨着我們的血踪，走向爭取民族生存的戰綫上去，我們却不能不感覺到無限的安慰，與無限的希望。共產黨主政的俄國，是怎樣嚴格地，在訓練他們的少年先鋒隊，汛繫黨主政的意國，是怎樣認眞地，在訓練他們的童軍團，國社黨主政的德國，是怎樣勤苦地，在訓練他們的少年團，其他如英美法日諸國，又是怎樣努力地，在敎育他們的兒童，我們主張：國民黨主政的祖國，也應該以同樣的嚴格，認眞，勤苦與努力，去訓練並敎養我們的兒童。這是救國的大道，也是養成大國民的基礎工作，想來，我全國的同胞，當能予以贊同的。兒童年中，我們所應進行之工作，在政府所頒怖的全國兒童年實施辦法大綱裏面，己經有了極詳盡的指示，本會唯當追隨國人之後，希望促成其澈底的實現。兒童年開幕之日，是兒童幸福事業展開之日；但兒童幸福事業是沒有心境的，絕不以兒童年之期滿而吿終，所以我們認爲，今後的兒童幸福事業，是應該由整個的國家，永遠担負責任的，對於兒童的「敎」「養」，應由敎育部與內政部負完全責任，至於如何聯絡並恊同全國各地之兒童幸福機關，學術研究機關，醫藥衛生機關，以及同情兒童幸福事業的人士，追隨政府之後，來努力完成兒童幸福的建設，這種責任，本會似覺義不容辭，責無旁貸。在今日過渡的時代，本會凜於所負責任之重大，自當黽勉驅馳，勇往邁進；唯以責重道遠，遺大投艱，尚祈國人隨時賜予最嚴厲的監督，最坦百的指示，以及最有效能的協助！</p>
<p>（說明）（中）全國兒童年實施委員會常委顧樹森（右）常委吳研因（左）總幹事薛天漢（下）該會全體職員（南京中華攝）</p>

<p>電界之聲</p>
<h3>為振務電報敬告辦理振務機關</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>兩週以來，長江流域一帶，天氣放晴，各埠水位，均告减退，被災之域，自可着手振濟，防汛之區，已過嚴重時期，鄉村雖已破壞，都市尚能保全，雖曰天意可迴，究係人事得力。然以災區之廣，幾被大江南北，受災之衆，不下數百萬戶，哀鴻遍野，待振方殷！故今後政策，治標的着重於振濟，治本的着重於疏溶，傳遞此項政策之消息，國有賴於電信者矣。</p>
<p>交通部爲扶助振務起見，曾規定振務電報一種，免費傳遞。此項電報之定義，歸納於振務電報規則之內，凡有權發寄之機關，爲國民政府或各省政府核淮之案之中國及外國振務團體，因辦理臨時或特別急振者。對於含有永久性質之尋常振務，或地方慈善團體及私人振濟所發之電報，均不能適用。</p>
<p>振務機關欲發寄此項電報，必須注意下列各點：（甲）請領執照時，應先向交通部呈明下列各欵：（一）振務團體之名稱及其住址，（二）代表人之姓名及職業，（四）呈准立案之機關及立案之年月日，（四）被災地點及其區域，（五）災區之情况，（六）辦振之目的及其辦法，（七）辦振期限之約計，（八）發寄電報之地名，（九）請領執照之數目。經交通部核准後，始得領給執照。（乙）執服有效期間，由交通部核定之，自核准給照之日起，以三個月或六個月爲限。如因災情重大，必須展期者，應呈經交通部核准另發執照。但此項展期，至多不得逾六個月，如振務業巳辦竣，無論執照已否滿期，應卽呈部註銷。（丙）振務電報之電文，限於下列各項緊急事務，不得夾雜他事：（一）關於報吿災區危急情形事項，（二）關係採辦振務急需各物及其轉運事項，（三）關於籌捐及催撥振欵事項，（四）關於振務上其他緊急事項，電文幷應力求簡短，限用中文或英文明語。中文每電不得逾百字，英文每電不得逾五十字。</p>
<p>以上係振務電報規則內容之大致也。查各國振務電報，無免費轉遞情事，與普通商報同等遇待，故亦無振務電報條文之限制。我國天災流行，年須振濟，是以頒行振務電報規則，以資遵行。其目的一則使發寄此項電報之機關，不致濫發，而得傳遞上之效率，一則使傳遞此項電報之綫路，不致擁擠，而增加報務上之困難。希望振務機關，嚴守範圍，發寄振務電報各電局自願樂於接收，决無拒絕之理。若不顧一切，濫予發寄，超過各局綫路上之容量，使之無法傳遞，恐亦難於維持此項規則之實行矣。</p>
<h3>水災聲中之電信交通</h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>近兩月來，長江及黃河流域各省，洪水汜濫，低窪縣市，淪爲澤國，爲害之烈，可稱空釁　民之生命財產受犧牲者，以千萬計，是誠我中華民族之大不幸也！</p>
<p>水災聲中，國營事業之受影響最鉅者，厥爲電信交通，蓋我國電信交通之設備，在內地各省以陸綫爲多，無綫電次之。此次沿長江及黃河各省被災各縣市之電報局所，或被冲毁，或將桿綫冲斷，或桿浸水中，漏電甚重，不能通報，使國內電信交通大受威脅，幸賴交通當局盡力維護，善爲調度，各地通信交通，始得維持不斷，或阻斷未久而卽吿恢復，爰將經過情形探述於次：</p>
<p>此次交部對於被水冲毁之電報桿綫，應付辦法計有四端：（一）爲派工搶修，凡電桿因大風雨或水流而折斷者，均立派大批綫工前往冒險搶修，雖在浸水之處，亦必設法豐桿，俾可恢復通報。（二）爲繞道建築臨時綫接通，以維通信，如湖北漢陽及沙市附近水勢甚大，原有桿綫幾全浸水中，修復無期，而川鄂電信交通異常重要，乃不得不設法繞去被災區域，建設臨時電報綫，以便接通原有電綫恢復通報。（三）爲調度綫路以維通報，如滬漢及京漢電報直達綫路，均曾數次被水阻斷，乃設法利用南京·徐州·鄭州。以至漢口之電綫，使滬漢京漢，仍可維持通報，不因原路阻斷而停止工作，此爲最經濟而有效之方法。（四）爲增加無綫電報機及工作時間，如滬漢電路一度因鄭漢間電綫同時被水冲毁，以致有綫電無路可走，乃不得不增加無綫電機，滬漢畫夜雙機工作，俾免報務積壓。其餘各地因水災而不能維持有綫電通信者，亦增加每日工作時間，以疏報務。此外如漢渝陸綫，在沙市宜昌間阻斷，一時無修復之望，除漢渝無綫電雙機通報外，復令南京與萬縣電臺專機日夜通報，將長江下游各處與川省往來電報分一部分由京萬路傳遞，萬縣以西，則仍利用陸綫傳遞，（因漢渝無綫電路雙機尚不能應付巨量報務），如此南京至重慶電報，雖因京漢及漢渝兩幹綫阻斷，仍可有兩路傳遞，一經京漢及漢渝無綫電路，一經京萬無綫電路及萬渝陸綫，報務庶不致受重大之稽延。</p>
<p>此次交部盡全力維持災區之電信交通，其意義殊爲重大，受其益者，不僅在防汛與救災通信上之便利，卽商民因水災而停購停運貨物之電報，以及慰間與報吿災情之通信，均得藉以迅速傳遞，不致感受無法通信之苦，亦受益之一端也。尤有進者，邇來川省勦匪軍事正在吃緊之際，中央與軍事當局之通訊，至爲重要，在此水災聲中，電信交通能勉爲維持，不致妨礙勦匪軍事之進展，此則尤塔吿慰者矣，</p>
<h3>談談「專送電報」</h3>
<p>— 中明</p>
<p>……請收發報人注意……</p>
<p>發報人所發電報，如所發的地方，雖設有電局或電台，而距離收報人所在地途程遙遠時，則此項電報，須由收報局雇用專差送達收報人，這種電報，就是專送電報。此項電報註有「專送」或「Express」字樣之納費標識，收報局於投送時，照例須按交通部所訂送報專力章程，向收報人收取專力費。如發報人願預爲收報人繳付專力費者，可以（專付……或XP……）爲納費標識，括弧內所繕虛點係代表國內電報之銀元或國際電報之法郎數目。至於專力費微收，其規定有如下述：</p>
<p>凡收報人住址與電局或電台（以下簡稱局台）在同一城市之內者，不收專力費。如不在同一城市之內，而距離局台五里以內者，不收專力費。五里以外至十里，收銀一角五分。十里以外至五十里，每多十里加收銀一角五分。五十里以外，每多十里加收銀二角。例如六十里，應收銀九角五分，餘類推。十里以外，其零數不及十里者，亦按十里計算。上述收取專力費數目之規定，一方爲使局台有所依據，一方爲使收報人便於查考。至於投送專送電報局台所以欲向收報人收取專力費的緣故，甚爲簡單，因爲局台報差之雇用，皆有定額，其主要任務爲投送一般電報，工作已够繁忙，如果這種專送電報，也由電局報差投送，勢必因路途遙遠往返費時之故，而躭誤其他電報，又如果這筆專力費由局台担負，則又因電費往往較專力費爲小，電局賠貼甚多，甚不合理」。因此之故，專送電報的專力費，必須由收報或發報人付給，國際電報業務規則內，業經規定。</p>
<p>至於局台在專送電報上所能給予公衆的便利，就是規定專力費用，防止專差額外需索，致收報人增加負担。並規定凡投送同一收報人之專送電報，如在同一時間一次投送者，不論若干封，均作一次計費。交通部有見及此特製專送報封並專力費收據各一種，凡局台投送專送電報，必須應用此特種電封，並須將專力費數目塡入專力費收據，交由專差帶交收報人收執，作爲憑證。如果此項電封及收據遇用馨或尚未發到時，則可改用尋常電封投送，惟局台須另行開具正式專力費收據，向收報人收取專力費，以昭愼重。</p>
<p>最後，吾們竭誠希望收報人收受專送電報繳付專力費時，務須注意下列四點：</p>
<p>（一）必須向專差索取專力費收據，然後付給專力費；</p>
<p>（二）來電電底有無（XP……）字樣，</p>
<p>（三）所開專力費收據，是否與規定數目及路程相符；</p>
<p>（四）所開專力費收據，是否蓋有局台戳記，並由經手人簽名或蓋章。</p>
<p>收報人對於此項收據，如發生疑義時，儘可詳叙原委，連同收據，逕寄南京交通部電政司，請求查核。電政司接到此項請求函件，定會嚴密查核辦理給予一個滿意的答復。</p>
<h3>交通部取締私設電台之意義</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>邇來各大日報，常有「交通部懸賞吿密私設電台」之廣吿，映觸於吾人之眼簾，究竟私設電台之性質何若？取締之原因何在？一般讀者似尚未作深切之注意，無正確之認識。記者不敏，願藉本刊之篇幅，一爲申論之。</p>
<p>夫電信交通，爲一國神經之所繫，非有統制之管理，難收指臂之功效。故國民政府公怖之電信條例，對於公私團體或個人設置之電信設備，規定須經交通部或其委託機關之核准。並於必要時，得派員檢查電信或出價收用之。蓋非如此，難免有不法之徒，假借電信設備爲圖謀不軌之工具，而貽國家社會莫大之隱憂。交通部爲遵行國家法令，維持公衆安寗起見，自不得不對於非法之私設電台，加以嚴密之取締，藉維電信管理之完整。此其一。</p>
<p>考無綫電信力傳遞，乃籍電波振盪之作用。而接收方面與發射方面，又須有和諧之振盪週率，始能收聽淸晰。故各台週率，必須高低不一，方可避免干擾，否則雜聲紛亂，必致無法工作。是以空間秩序之維持爲無綫電信必要之條件。最近交部因本埠民營廣播電台設置過多，所有週率，已支配無餘，故已公吿停發設台許可證，卽其一例。彼祇知營私不顧公益之私設電台者，旣不受交部之監督，其發射之週率，自無法加以規定，空間之干擾，必致愈增嚴重，交部爲維持無綫電通信效率起見，對於不顧大體之私設電台，必須加以嚴厲之制裁，自不待言。此其二。</p>
<p>按一般私設電台，除圖謀不軌，另有法律制裁姑置不論外，大都私自通信兜攬商報，並竊聽公家電臺電報，藉以牟利。此種非法行爲，不特電局方面，蒙其損失。金融界新聞界方面，亦必感受嚴重之威脅。按照刑法「電氣以物論」，此輩私設電台者，卽構成盜竊侵佔之罪。上年天律永立永增合兩銀號私設電台一案，天津檢察處卽以盜竊罪提起公訴。有關係各界，亟應共同檢舉，務使不法之徒，盡行剷除。固不僅交部方面之取締而已也。此其三。</p>
<p>吾人嘗觀世界先進各國，不論其政體何若，政府所頒之法令與政策，必得人民之忠誠合作，實施無阻。故政府得發揮其權能，爲人民謀福利。彼私設電台者，其營私，盜竊，不法之罪惡，旣如上述。吾信國人必能擁護交通部此種取締之政策，共謀實施制裁之方而國人對於公家服務之興趣與努力，亦將於此</p>
<h3>試述國內華文密語新聞電報暫行辦法</h3>
<p>— 儲浩</p>
<p>——今日起實行，請新聞界注意——</p>
<p>近月以來，各地新聞機關或其訪員，以所發新聞電報之經由無綫電路傳遞者，每被他報竊聽登載，權利多所損失，籲請交通當局設法取締。交部據請，卽通令各局台一體嚴密注意，當地新聞機關如有偷抄新聞刊載情事，應依法處理；並規定凡有有綫電路可通之處，其新聞電報應儘量交由有綫電路傳遞；更頒行國內密語新聞電報暫行辦法，俾可用密語拍發，使他人無法了解其文義。此外並擬擇定重要無綫電路，改裝高速度自動無綫電收發報機，使收發電符速率非常提高，外人根本無術竊聽。（按國際電台所用收發報機，均係高速度自動裝置，極爲秘密可靠。）至前項密語新聞電報辦法，定於本日起開始施行，茲摘錄其內容大要於次，以供新聞界之參考：</p>
<p>（一）密語新聞電報以交由北平，南京，上海，漢口，長沙，天津，濟南，南昌，福州，廣州，厦門靑島，烟台，成都，巴縣，貴陽，昆明，長安，張家口，蘭州電報局國內無綫電路傳遞者爲限。其辦法除本辦法特別規定者外，其餘一律遵照訂新聞電報章程辦理。</p>
<p>（二）凡新聞報館　期刊報館，或新聞經理處，或其記者，下文簡稱新聞機關或其記者）如欲發寄密語新聞電，應遵照新聞電報章程第二條之規定，填具願書，連同密語電本一份，由收電新聞機關與當地電報局接洽，轉呈交通部電政司核辦。一經核准發給據照後，該新聞機關應再備具同樣密電本。分別寄交或送交收報及發報電局各一份備查，始准發寄該項電報。該項密電本，如使用日久，或有其他事故，要求更換時，應由原新聞機關或其記者，備具同樣密雷本，分別寄交或送交收發報局存查，並呈報交通部電政司備案。</p>
<p>（三）密語新聞電電文除用密語書寫外，並應將原文按字開列於電碼之旁，以便查閱。所用密電碼，以四碼代表華文明語一字爲限，按照明語新聞電報價目同樣收費。</p>
<p>（四）密語新聞電之收電機關名稱及地址，除已掛號者外，須用明語書寫。收報人姓名往址之前，並應加註Copress字樣之納費標識，作一字計費。</p>
<p>（五）密語新聞電電碼如經查明與繳存之密電本不符，或有不合情事時，收發報局應予扣留，並呈報交通部電政司取銷其拍發新聞電報憑照。</p>
<p>按十八年六月間，交通部訂有無綫電台傳遞密語新聞電報暫行規則之公布，內容與現行辦法，無甚出入。第以公布之後，新聞界利用之者。甚屬寥寥，遂於二十二年八月間將該規則明令廢止。不謂時隔兩稔，而新聞界所發國內無綫電新聞電報時以被竊聞，足證密語新聞電報辦法，確爲新聞業所需要，而當初新聞界之不知利用爲失計矣。深望新聞界諸君子今後儘量援用此縝密安善之密語新聞電辦法，以保全本身之利益也！</p>
<h3>新訂納費公電收費辦法之優點</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>收發報人對於所收或所發電報之任何部份，如有必須查問，或更正補充，或註銷原電者，照章均可要求電局拍發納費公電。但收發報人往往因未知利用納費公電辦法，尚有逕自電致對方查詢，或自行電請更正補充原原電之任何部份或聲明註銷原電者，以致損失電費，竟向電局交涉退還原電，或所發查問電報之報費。在電局方面，根據定章，對於　此項事件，並無退回報費之義務。然在收發報人方面，以爲電局服務不週到，不能給予公衆充分便利，因此不免發生種種誤會。最近交通部重訂劃一納費公電收費辦法一種，定自二十四年八月一日起實行。愛將此項辦法之優點，詳爲申述，俾公衆對於拍發納費公電辦法，可以深切明瞭盡量利用。</p>
<p>（一）收報人對於所收來電之任何部份，（包括住址，電文，署名等項）發生疑義，認爲傳遞有誤，可將來電持往電局要求拍發納費公電，向原發報局或轉向發報人查復者，除原電電文係由發報人外，所有往來公電，均免收費。此項免費查問來電電文疑字辦法實行以來，各界稱便。</p>
<p>（二）收報人如因來電並無發報人署名，未知係何人所發，或因未悉發報人現在住址，無法拍發回電者，均可要求電局代爲拍發納費公電，向發報局查詢。此項發出之公電，免予計費，祇須由請求人預付六字之回電報費。（原電如係國內華文或洋文電報，不論屬於何種報類或電文，其回電報費槪按國內華文明語，或洋文商電價目計費。如係國際電報不論屬於何種報類或電文，其回電報費，槪照國際商電全價計費。但請求人如不欲由發報局電復，僅須用郵函答復者，國內祇須付掛號信之郵資，國外祇須付掛號郵資八十生丁）。此項納費公電，向例應由請求人按字柳費，自新訂辦法實行以後，請求人可省一筆去電報費矣。</p>
<p>（三）發報人所發電報，如經收報局來電通知因收報人姓名住址欠詳或有錯誤，以致無法投送。發報人可立卽要求電局代爲拍發納費公電，通知收報局，將原電之收報人姓名住址補充或更正後，再行照送。所有補充或更正之字，係按字計費。例如補充收報人住址五字，祇收五字之報費。疋正收報人姓名或住址一字，祇收一字之報費。此項公電，如照舊章，須由發報人按全電所含字數納費，自新訂辦法施行後，發報人亦可减省一部份報費也。</p>
<h3>國際無綫電話之發展</h3>
<p>— 光</p>
<p>本篇所述，僅及以英京倫敦爲中心之無綫電話網，其他各國，槪無與焉。</p>
<p>國際間長途無綫電話之發軔，遠在西歷一九二三年，當時英國郵電局與美國電報電話公司合作研究，擬在大西洋兩岸建設無綫電話業務，斯時對於短波之傳播特性，尚未闡明，故决用長波通訊。</p>
<p>此項計劃决定後，雙方卽在此綫路內，從事觀測電波傳播特性，究屬如何，藉以决定適用之波長，及發射機之電力，務使於終年內，無論時季晝夜，均可暢通無阻。觀測結果，認爲以二百基羅華特電力之發射機。採用單邊波帶無載波方式，Single　Sideband　Suppressed　CarierSystem，而收話方面，復採用定向天綫，則商用業務，定可實現。於是英美兩方，努力進行，以期早觀厥成，藉利商業。英國方面，發話台裝設於路倍，（Rugby）而收話台初設於勞頓，（Wionghton）後遷至克白法，（CuparEfei）控制機件則均裝在倫敦之國際交換所。美國方面，發話台裝於洛磯坡，（Rocky　poin　long　Island）收話台裝在好頓，（Houlton　Maine）控制機伴則裝於紐約交換所。一九二七年一月，倫敦紐約間，正式開放商用無綫電話，從此兩地居民，在普通電話機上，便可互視談話，其便利可知矣。</p>
<p>英美無綫電話開放未久，成績非常圓滿，綫路卽向兩端擴充，英端擴充至英國全部及歐洲大陸，美國則接連加拿大墨西哥古巴等國。因此業務驟增，原有長波綫路，竟吿不敷應用。當此之時，短波無綫電發展極速，其適用於長途通訊，已屬極明顯之事實，英美兩國，因郎於大西洋兩岸，進行短波無綫電話試騐，以期得一適當短波無綫電話之設備。</p>
<p>一九二八年六月短波無綫電話試騐，已吿成功，商用綫路，卽行正式開放通話，翌年六月及十二月，復添設短波電話綫路二個，以應商業上之需要，</p>
<p>一九三零年二月，英國與船舶問之無綫電話業務正式開放。四月與南美洲亦開始通話。</p>
<p>一九三二年至三三年問，英國與南非洲加拿大埃及印度等處，先後開放無綫電話業務。今春三月，倫敦東京間，亦吿正式通話。</p>
<p>觀夫上述無綫電話發展情形，可知倫敦已成爲世界無綫電話網中心之一，其原有收話台，自屬不敷應用，遂於一九三零年遷至白特克，（Baldcck）新台占地九百英畝，定向天綫，數逾三十，規模之大，可見一般。</p>
<p>倫敦除爲世界無綫電綱之中心外，復有水綫接連歐洲各大都會，於是世界各大都會間，凡與倫敦互通電話者，不論無綫水綫，均可由倫敦　接通話，世界電給交通，更形利便。</p>
<p>無綫電話技術上之困難，經數年來默美各國製造家之努力，均吿解决。現以無綫電通話者，其淸晰程度，與城市電話，毫無分別。</p>
<p>水綫電話，因加負荷（Loading）之困難，僅適合於較短距離通話之用，已屬公認之事官，故無綫電實爲長途電話（在數千英里以上者）之專用品。其成本旣輕，通話又復淸晰，前途發展，未可限量也。</p>
<p>我國無綫電事業之發展，雖較默美爲遲，然與歐美各國通話事宜，經交部當局積極籌備，不久卽可見諸事實。國際通訊發達可預卜也。</p>
<h3>交通部電政司二十三年度統收支報告</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>過去一年，交通部電政司整頓各項業務，力求電信事業商業化，對於財務方面之整理，如改良收支辦法，淸還內外債欵，報費存欵給息（卽報費保證金辦法）等等，亦經一一見諸實施，其中以實行統收統支一項，辦理尤著成效，茲將經過情形，及一年來收支報吿略述於後，</p>
<p>統收統支辦法，係於上年七月一日起實行，由交通部電政司與郵政儲金匯業總局簽訂代理收付合同，及代收報話費辦法各一種，所有部轄一二等以上電報電話局及無綫電台，共計八十餘處報話費收入，統應逐日解繳當地郵政儲匯局暫解上海儲匯總局，收入電政司統字戶，各該局台按月經常開支，核實造具請欵書，呈送電政司詳加查核後，通知儲匯總局轉飭各地儲贓局如期發放。儲匯總局收到各地匯來報話費，每日塡造報吿單，並於月終彙造收支總結單，寄交電政司，俾與各局台報吿互相核對，隨時登帳。稽核方法，至爲嚴密，從前浮支濫報，挪用虧欠之弊，幾已全部廓淸，此爲電司方面最顯著之利益。至郵局方面運用此項存欵，以作各種報資，所獲利益，當亦可觀。該項辦法實行以來，雙方經辦人員，均能權誠合作，應付一切難題，合同期限，原定試辦六個月，上年十二月庇試辦期滿，經雙方同意，展期六個月，本年六月底又屆期滿，復經商定展期一年。</p>
<p>自上年七月份起，至本年六月底止，總計收入八百十三萬四千餘元，支出約九百三十五萬五千元，收支兩抵實在不敷一百二十二萬元，每月平均不敷十萬元，此項不敷之欵，卽照合同規定向儲匯總局暫行透支，所有透支本息均經隨時付淸。茲將全年收支細數開列於下。</p>
<h3>答鎭江康君鼎基問</h3>
<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>頃承　台端惠函，垂詢關於電話號碼代替收報人住址計費辦法各節，隨擇要答復如次：</p>
<p>答（一）凡用電話號碼代替收報人住址之電報，例如；「北平話東二一零五王誠」或「上海話租界九四零一三涂筱巢」作四字計費。但如須由收報局用電話傳送於收報人者，應由發報人於納費標識欄內，加註「話傳」或（TF）字樣標識，連同電話號簿作爲一宇，其書寫格式如下：「TF話租界八一二三三一一上海高秉鈞」。作五字計費。依據上述舉例，凡用電話號碼代替收報人住址，而由收報局用當地電話局號碼查明收報人住址復交報差投送者，連同收報地名及收報入姓名共作四字計費。如須由收報局用電話傳送於收報人者，則另加「話傳」或（TF）字樣納費標識，連同電話號碼，收報地名及收報人姓名等項共作五字計費。至代替收報人住址之電話號碼，連同TF字樣納費標識，在洋文電報內，可作一字計算、但收報人名及收報地名，均須另行按字計費。例如TFSettlement　79542=Smith　Shangbai應按三字計費。</p>
<p>答（二）查電話碼代替收報人住址辦法第五條條文稍嫌含糊，已由電政司於二十三年九月十　日通電各局飭知，「凡照電話號碼代替收報人住址辦法第四條甲項第一例格式書寫之收報地名及收報人住址姓名，卽「北平話東二一零五王誠，」應作四字計費，每二例仍作五字計費。」各電局自經上項通電明白解釋後，當可不至再有誤會矣。上述舉例之畫寫格式，雖有不同，然其區別甚為　　　　　對於辦法。並無前後矛盾之舉也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>寫在兒童年開幕日</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>愛倫凱說：「二十世紀是兒童的世紀」。世界各文明國家，早有兒童節的規定。它們對於兒童事業，莫不加以深切的注意，使兒童在社會的懷抱下，獲得充分的幸福。就是我們落後的中國，舉行兒童年，也有四年的歷史。迨至今年，中央政府為擴大兒童本為運動，又規定自本年八月一日起，至明年七月三十日止，為兒童年，從事於各種宣傳。這意義是更重大的。今天便是中國兒童年的開幕日。</p>
<p>中國的兒童，素來不大為社會所重視。他們的地位，只是家庭的私產。豈知兒童乃社會國家民族的主人翁，未來社會的進展，國家的強旺，民族的興盛，都寄託在現在的兒童身上。二十世紀的社會，以兒童為中心，這是人類最大的覺悟。</p>
<p>兒童年對於兒童的期望，概括言之，不外是想使中國的兒童，他日能成為一個健全的國民，以便為社會國家民族謀福利。但如何才可以使兒童成為一個健全的國民？這就是要留心兒童的教養方面。我們對於每個中國兒童，應給以相當的教養，使他們的身心，都能得到自由的發展。</p>
<p>關於兒童的教養，這責任中國一向是放在家庭。本來家庭教養兒童，是最適宜的。但我國家庭既將兒童當作私產，因之家庭之為父母者，每依自己的願望，任意把他們塑成一個模型。在富有家庭只能養成一些驕奢惰逸的兒童，普遍家庭則不過製造一批無知無識的子女。這於社會都是不利的。</p>
<p>故今後的兒童，應從家庭解放出來，使他們由家庭私產，變成社會分子。兒童年的實現，首先要提高兒童的地位和權利。然後由社會以最善的方法，教之養之，使他們成為一個知慧充實，生機活潑，精神飽滿，體格強壯，思想豐富，品行純正的健全國民。</p>
<p>但我這樣的主張，并不是說，兒童的教養，應全由社會擔負，家庭可以一概不過問。我的意思是，兒童既是社會組織的核心，則凡關於兒童的教養問題，當由社會予以指導和處理。而家庭則需改變原來的觀念，以人羣的福利為前提，各盡其對於子女應盡的義務。</p>
<p>至社會要教養兒童，對於各種社會事業，如兒童公園，兒童圖書館，兒童運動場，兒童教養院，托兒所，以及兒童感化院等，都應有充分的設備。這種事業，在外國已成習見，在我國則尚未舉辦。這是我們應當注意的。</p>
<p>這裏有一事是必須特別提起來說的，即兒童年應是普遍的，而不是部份的。社會要教養兒童，并不限於少數特殊階級，大多數窮苦家庭的兒童，我們也不能忽略。這才是中國兒童的幸福，亦才是今年政府舉行兒童年的真意義。</p>
<p>現在的中國，已陷入一個危機四伏的境地，未來的大難，或有甚於今日者。故救國的工作，成年人固不能辭其責，兒童又應奮發努力。蓋此後復興民族的重任，正待今日一般兒童來肩承。我們在這兒童年的開幕日，以此期望於我國親愛的兒童。</p>
<h3>褪色的故事</h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>故事是關於枇杷，但枇杷早已過時了，且故事的發生在遼遠的十年以前，所以我想，這故事一定是褪色的。</p>
<p>初來上海，家裏人便要我在枇杷時節返里一次，當初我滿口答應，原意不是敷衍，我倒的的確確想返里大吃一頓枇杷的。可是到滬後，日子着實過得糊塗，看着金黃色的枇杷一簍一簍的上市了，我的心着實想飛過揚子江北的枇杷院里去。家裏人又幾次來信，說枇杷快要熟了，說枇杷纍纍滿樹了，可是我一味懶，打不起興緻回去。</p>
<p>最近，炎日當空，我決意要回到鄉下去。明知此去枇杷無論如何是吃不到的了，可是使我日夜想起的還是枇杷，甚至在夢裏也會見到一顆顆的金黃色的枇杷滿掛在樹枝上…</p>
<p>十年以前，還是孩子時候，從枇杷的開花時起，我便天天關心着枇杷的成長。那時祖母還不曾去世，她老人家一天到晚沒有事做，像孩子樣的天天關心着枇杷。從枇杷轉黃時起，她便用全心力對討着幾顆枇杷樹了。白天，她側着門躺在一張熟到紅色的竹椅子上，終朝的瞟看着枇杷樹。晚上，連煤油燈也不點，還是側着門躺在一張熟到紅色的竹椅子上看守着枇杷樹。本來用不到看守的，只是我們這一般孩子太撒野了，青枇杷尚還要吃，黃枇杷當然要出險了。於是祖母只有看守，於必要時用她唯一的武器——一支手杖來敲打偷枇杷的孩子們。</p>
<p>當然我是絕端害怕的。心裏雖然想偷，可是在祖母面前我是假裝着十分馴</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>服，十分聽話的孩子，因此，在孩子們中祖母特別寶貝着我，但所謂寶貝也只是口頭上說說而已，並不因此，我便可以得到黃金色的枇杷。不得已，還是出之「偷」的一道。晚上因爲太疲憊了，一到牀上便沉沉地睡去，一覺醒來，萬籟俱寂，當然那還是深夜時分。於是偷偷地起來爬到枇杷樹上去，那時除了和我熟識的狗對我搖搖尾巴外一切都是靜靜的。在星子底下不十分淸楚的摘着大而黃的枇杷吃。一顆顆，一顆顆，直吃到下頜酸了纔爬下來倒在牀上，酣暢地睡去。第二天在祖母的面前我還是一個十分馴服，十分聽話的孩子。</p>
<p>父親和母親太勤儉了，所以出了　去買水菓是不允許的。正因如此，我惟有在深夜的一剎那滿足我僅有的慾望。</p>
<p>祖母把黃金色的枇杷摘了進去，秘藏着，連自已也不高興暢暢地吃，當然，在當時我是不瞭解這些的。等到枇把轉色，形將枯爛了，於是用手招着我，給我五六顆，這在她已是極大的賜予了，因爲她是寶貝着我的。至於別的孩子呢，連枯燜的也沒有份兒。</p>
<p>如今祖母已去世，故事也早已褪色，只是每年看到黃金色的枇杷時把這故事咀嚼一回罷了。假使近年來在枇杷時節回去，我當然可以把枇杷吃個痛快的。但年齡一大，興緻淡了。挽不回的童心正如西去的挽不回的落日…。我急着返里，祖母墳上的蔓草大槪又一度靑靑了，不久，盛夏去，淸秋到來，靑靑的蔓草又該枯黃的吧。</p>
<h3>趕賭</h3>
<p>— 丁蔚南</p>
<p>拐一個彎，深長的巷，給丟在屁股後啦。步伐給拖長着自己的影子，漫黑的廣塲，兜上了眼膜，老遠的林子裏，有狗嗥嗥的在叫。</p>
<p>亮通通的光，在那邊鎭上照着。</p>
<p>到那邊還有二三里路呢！</p>
<p>「老三，帶起點脚，不早了吶，也許倒了幾攤了，我們也得沾沾呢」！喊老三的那個人，一口子的酒氣，顚顚瘋瘋的，揚了揚手，雖然是天黑，看不見他逼眞的臉孔，可是影子的輪廓，是看得見的。脚下踢着一顆石子，谷的一聲，他踣了一下，像有點微微的痛。</p>
<p>「嘿，酒鬼，昨夜黃老大的一寶靑龍，眞够我算準了，的確是有「路」的，一寶就給我打翻了攤，眞够本領兒，你如果不是跟我，準會輸錢的」。老三的喉嚨。在黑影裏看得見他在惹大的指。</p>
<p>「別吹牛了，計得準嗎？那你不發了財，爲什麽老婆還要駡你死猪呢」？老三背後的黑影子挿嘴，糊糊地，好像他的頭偏了幾偏，又好像帶着（？）的號式，攤攤手。</p>
<p>怎麼計不準呢？你這飯桶，老子在外面打流，比你們資格老吶。……老婆駡，嘿，她敢」。</p>
<p>「別嘴老了，我們都看得見」！</p>
<p>「酒鬼倒是怕老婆的」，老三打趣着，「今夜他偷偷地吸了些酒，我打從他門過，他偷偷地送眼色，自然老婆是在傍邊吃飯，然而我是曉得的，當然　他是叫我等他啦，酒鬼：是不是」？他把頭搖轉後頭來，他是打先鋒的。</p>
<p>「可不是嗎？昨夜眞吵死啦，幸喜他還沒有輸錢，拿得出來給她看，才算了事吶，眞管得緊，的確是個老婆「娘」，哈哈，酒鬼一！</p>
<p>酒鬼不肯響了，歪着頭，走着。</p>
<p>的鑼鼓聲，是敲進了他們的耳朶了。星子躱在老高的天空裏眯着眼睛，月亮給地球瞧着，還沒有滾出來。</p>
<p>大踏步的展過去，黑暗是給阻在光芒的刺圈外。康王廟的門前，許多的小販，在地下擺着攤子，一地的瓜子壳，和悶人頭昏的油煎氣味。數不出的面孔，老的，少的，男的，女的，都一齊朝若台上開，把屁股供向着殿上的菩薩。空氣是怪氤氳的。</p>
<p>三個人頭給夾在一家設着賭攤的人羣裏，挺亮的煤汽燈，高懸在頭上，照得出地下落着的針子。骰子在寶盒裏，叮噹叮噹的跳着，給一聲「靑龍」或者「老虎」，壓的人的面孔上，有的通紅，有的慘白。</p>
<p>像泡沫匯進了大海中一樣，找不出他們的影子，一切都在呼盧喝雉的聲中！</p>
<h3>竹嗡嗡（上）</h3>
<p>— 天鵠</p>
<p>回家幾天之後的一天下午，搖着芭蕉扇在一顆大槐樹下納凉，忽見我的四弟在刷布塲上，簸着膀子，怪起勁的抖着竹嗡嗡玩。</p>
<p>「嗡嗡……」不絕的聲響，漸漸地破裂了這草地上靜寂的空氣，在四弟的身後，有許多孩子用鹽羨的神氣看着那似乎是一件怪東西的竹嗡嗡。</p>
<p>四弟是怎樣的驕傲，他在停止抖嗡之後，同伴們用謟媚的神氣圍着他，和他講話，他用着一種高壓式的語氣吿訴他同伴以這個竹嗡嗡的來歷。</p>
<p>的確，在我們村上，這竹嗡嗡還是件不常見的物事，四弟這一個是從聖堂頭老坤和的茶館店裏買來的。不知怎樣，老坤和這一回也異想天開，會從城裏催了這一項貨物來；昨天我帶四弟到茶館裏去，偶然看見了便買了個給他。</p>
<p>四弟似乎玩疲了，他將二根竹棒和一個竹槓，用抽的綫紮成球形，捧在頭上，神氣怪驕傲的，在同伴艷羨的視綫中他到屋子裏去了。</p>
<p>情形使我看了似乎很有些反威，我見了四弟便對他說，「你有了個竹嗡嗡就顯寶似的在人面前驕傲，你有，人家沒有，留心引記人家的不樂意，他們會不和你玩呢！」</p>
<p>「他們沒有，都眼熱我，尤其是小火根……」四弟頭轉側得很快，他像知他像知道說滿話要愛我的訓責，便用溫柔的笑意，結束他想說而不曾說出的話。</p>
<p>又是隔了二天的一個午後，我正坐在西窗下讀書，忽地空氣裏傳來大陣的嗡嗡聲，孩子們的喧鬧。擾亂了我的神情，便信步走到塲，只見村裏常聚在一起的八九個小孩，都拿了竹嗡嗡，在繞　抽綫玩的怪有味，四弟也在裏面，跳躍得最忙，但離他們一羣的十來步外，站着一個很醜陋的小孩，　着大拇指，看着熱鬧的一羣痴笑，他那吊着左眼的小臉，我一看就認得他，他就是小火，—村裏挑鹹湯炳生的兒子。（未完）</p>

<h3>The Subei Embankment is Completed: The Rising Waters of Weishan Lake Flood Southward to Pêi East. Representatives from Shandong Return to Heze After Inspection. Both the Yun and Yi Rivers are Rising.</h3>
<p>T'ungshan Dispatch: Following the rapid rise of the Weishan Lake waters, they are now flooding southward from the north bank, having reached Pêi East. Within days, they are expected to flood the south bank. The Weishan Lake Embankment has been fully completed. After inspection, representatives from Shandong believe that the Subei Embankment is located on the west bank of Weishan Lake and is unrelated to the Yellow River's entry into the Grand Canal, resolving the misunderstanding. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hsüchow) Shao Han-yüan, Wang Kung-yü, Yü Shu-fang, and Shandong representatives Sun Tse-jang and others, after inspecting the Weishan Lake Embankment in Pêi yesterday, returned to Hsüchow that night.

Sun and others returned to Hoze this afternoon. Shao is scheduled to go to Linchia Dam with Wang Kung-yü and Yü Shu-fang tomorrow for inspection. The reconstruction of the dam has been completed, and after inspection, a request will be made to the province to install a sluice gate for opening and closing. Construction of the Chingshan Embankment outside of Linchia Dam has begun. The embankment is seven li long and is expected to be completed in one week. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanking) The Yellow River is rapidly flowing into Weishan Lake, endangering the Kiangsu Embankment.

<h3>The Yungting River Rose Three Feet in Half a Day. The River Authority Cables Each Section to Take Strict Precautions.</h3>
<p>(Tientsin) Before 7:00 AM on the 31st, the water level at Huilung Temple on the Yungting River was 9 feet.

The Lungfeng River, affected by the floodwaters from the North Grand Canal, also rose significantly. The Lungfeng Control Sluice on the river has not been completed, and the riverbed has been silted up for a long time, preventing it from being used as a dike, causing the floodwaters to be trapped. On the night of the 30th, the water also overflowed. More than a thousand acres of fertile land were submerged in thirty villages along the river, including Huangchuang, Lao Mi Tien, San Li T'un, and Tungchou. The water level is still rising. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Luan River Raged, Washing Away Both East and West Banks.</h3>
<p>(Tientsin) There were two days of heavy rain in Locheng County. By the 30th, flash floods had washed through, and the Locheng River continued to rise by three feet on the 30th, with white waves surging skyward and the river being unusually turbulent. Due to the rapid flow of water, a newly built section of the rear bank made of stones was washed away. There was a breach of about 16 feet on the east bank and a breach of 21 feet on the west bank. Officials and citizens are gathering to try to close the breaches. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tientsin) The heavy rain in eastern Tientsin stopped on the 30th. The water levels of each river have receded slightly, and the danger has been averted. However, a large number of wheat seedlings and cotton plants have been washed away, making the autumn harvest hopeless.

<p>(Nanking) Of the two million yuan allocated for disaster relief preparedness in the second budget reserve for this year, the original plan was to allocate just over ten thousand yuan per month, so that two million yuan would be fully allocated within a year. Now, because the Yangtze River flood is so severe, it has been decided to allocate one million yuan at once, to be distributed to the four provinces of Hunan, Hupeh, Kiangsi, and Anhwei for disaster relief. As for the counties in the four provinces that have been affected, according to reports from the Accounting Committee, there are seven counties in southern Hunan, fifty counties and the city of Hankow in Hupeh, forty-eight counties in Kiangsi, and thirteen counties in Anhwei.

The Yüan ordered Chekiang, Chahar, Shantung, and Suiyuan Provinces, as well as Tientsin City, to reply by telegram, and each department is being notified to comply. C.

They will begin work this month and report to the Executive Yüan for the record. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanking) Hsü Shih-ying went to the Executive Yüan at 5:00 PM on the 31st to visit Acting President K'ung Hsien-hsi to discuss ways to relieve the flood in the four provinces of Hunan, Hupeh, Kiangsi, and Anhwei. Hsü said that the situation of the flood in the provinces along the river was dire and pitiful, and that the vitality of the people had been exhausted, and relief could not be delayed. Of the four provinces he had visited, Hupeh was the most severely affected, followed by Hunan and Kiangsi, and Anhwei was the least affected. The disaster relief measures he had presented included both short-term and long-term relief. The fundamental solution lies in reorganizing, and he is currently drafting a fundamental solution that includes all water conservancy issues of the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Han Rivers, as well as those that should be repaired and reorganized. The draft will be completed in two days and submitted to the central government for adoption. Due to the severity of this disaster, in addition to government allocations for relief, all parties must also contribute. Philanthropists and the municipal government in Shanghai have launched a fundraising campaign. He is scheduled to take the Chiang An ship to Shanghai on the 2nd to report the disaster situation to all parties and plan for fundraising. He will not stay in Shanghai for long and plans to go to P'ing and Yü to inspect the Yellow River's water situation and disaster situation.

<h3>The National Economic Council Received a Report Regarding the Breach of the Yellow River Embankment.</h3>

At the same time, a section of the embankment between the Fifth and Sixth breaches suddenly collapsed, covering a large area and creating a serious situation. It is said that although the water volume is currently increasing, the riverbed is very shallow and the water force is not turbulent. If the autumn flood arrives, it will be even more dangerous. Efforts are currently being made to construct and maintain the embankment. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Ordered Each Province to Recruit Labor to Dredge Rivers and Build Embankments.</h3>
<p>(Hankow) Chiang telegraphed the provincial governments along the river, stating that this year's major flood has caused disaster, and he has already telegraphed all armies to donate funds for relief. However, the way to govern and bring peace is still to dredge rivers and build embankments, which is a matter of urgency. During this flood, the recruitment of labor should be prepared according to the regulations of the Executive Headquarters for dredging rivers and building embankments. Refugees should also be recruited for work relief, treating both the symptoms and the root causes, as a permanent solution. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Shantung River Affairs Bureau Plans to Block the Breaches in the Embankment.</h3>
<p>(Tsinan) The River Bureau telegraphed the provincial government reporting that the breaches in the embankment are being severely eroded. The head of the eastern embankment has not collapsed. Chang Lien-chia will return to Tsinan to discuss blocking and building measures. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Amoy) There was a violent storm with wind and rain all night on the 30th. The rain stopped after daybreak on the 31st, but the wind did not diminish. After the planes from Shanghai and Kwangtung passed through Amoy, the sky darkened again in the afternoon, and the wind and rain intensified, not stopping at 9:00 or 10:00 PM. The ships in the inner harbor, as well as the trains to Changchow and Chuanchow in Amoy, were still stopped. The water in Changchow rose again. The water depth along the Chiu-lung River and the Kiangtung Bridge was 2 feet. Small boats between Amoy and Kulangsu were taking risks to ferry passengers, charging 2 jiao per person. The temperature dropped to 77 degrees in the evening. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Amoy) According to a telephone call from Changchow, there was heavy rain on the 30th and 31st. On the 31st, the water in the Chiu-lung River rose by more than 10 feet.

<h3>The National Economic Council Issued Two Major Demerits Against Yang Szu-lien.</h3>
<p>(Nanking) During the tense flood control situation in Hankow caused by the major flood, Yang Szu-lien, Director of the Chiang Han Public Works Bureau, requested sick leave and went directly to the hospital, which drew criticism from all sides. The National Economic Council sent personnel to investigate and found that although he had been telegraphed to work diligently despite his illness, he still delayed, resulting in the abandonment of bureau affairs. Although Wuhan did not suffer a major disaster, it is difficult to absolve him of the blame for negligence. On the 21st, an order was issued to give the bureau director two major demerits as a warning, but during the major flood season, he is still responsible for earning merit to offset his demerits, supervising his subordinates, and strictly defending the area. It must also be thoroughly investigated and punished whether civil servants have been negligent in their duties. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The German Reporter Müller Arrived in Changyuan After Being Released.</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Ch'in Te-ch'un received a telephone report from Changyuan stating that the German reporter Müller, who was kidnapped by bandits in Paoch'ang, had been released by the bandits and arrived in Changyuan at 3:30 PM on the 31st. He is scheduled to return to P'ing on the 1st for rest and recuperation. After receiving the telegram, Ch'in immediately notified the German Embassy and reported to both the Military and Political Affairs Committees. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the kidnapping of British and German reporters Jones and Müller, there were rumors yesterday that Müller had left the bandits' lair and would arrive in Changyuan today, but as of this afternoon, there has been no official report. Relevant parties are still trying their best to rescue them. After the British and German reporters were kidnapped, the P'ing Military Branch sent a telegram this afternoon to the Chahar Provincial Government, asking them to take responsibility for a swift rescue. Ch'in Te-ch'un inquired about the rescue situation with Chen Ying in Changyuan by long-distance telephone this afternoon and also asked Hsiao to inquire about whether the German reporter was out of danger. Hsiao was originally scheduled to leave Changyuan for P'ing this morning, but because he had to handle the rescue in Chahar, he changed his departure to tomorrow morning. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Rumors have it that after the German reporter Miller was kidnapped by bandits, the bandits saw that he was unusually weak and feared for his life if he stayed in the bandits' lair for too long. Therefore, they released him yesterday morning. After regaining his freedom, Miller rushed to Paoch'ang and reported to the German China Automobile Company in Changyuan by long-distance telephone, saying that he had escaped danger and arrived in Paoch'ang and would be able to go to Changyuan from Paoch'ang today. However, as of this afternoon, neither the Chinese nor foreign parties have received an accurate report of Miller's whereabouts. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Mr. Sa, a counselor at the British Embassy, visited Wang K'e-min at the Political Reorganization Committee at 10:00 AM today, asking the Chinese government to quickly find a way to rescue Jones. Wang promised to telegram the Chahar Provincial authorities to do their best to rescue him. After Mr. Sa visited Wang, he told people that the news that the German reporter Miller had left the bandits' lair was only seen in the newspapers, and the details were still unknown. But in any case, Jones is still not out of danger. Mr. Sa, a military officer at the British Embassy, is currently traveling in the Lei-tien Ranch in Outer Mongolia. This morning, he telegraphed P'ing, saying that he would rush from Lei-tien to Changyuan to assist the Chinese government in finding a way to rescue him. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Japanese Military Attaché Takahashi stated that the kidnapping location of the British and German reporters was on the border of Chahar Province, 50 li east of Paoch'ang. If the Japanese side needs to contribute to the rescue, the Japanese side will do its best to assist so that the reporters can escape danger as soon as possible. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Feng Chih-an came to P'ing from Changyuan at 6:00 PM on the 31st. According to him, the German reporter has been released, but the British reporter is still not out of danger. The Chahar Provincial Government is intensifying its rescue efforts. The Magistrate of Paoch'ang County reported that there were no Chinese security teams at the kidnapping location. No formal contact has yet been made, so the conditions demanded by the bandits are not very clear. Hsiao Chen-ying still has matters to deal with in Chahar, and it is uncertain whether he will be able to return to P'ing on the 1st. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to news from Chinese sources in Changyuan, the commander of the Paoch'ang militia has contacted the bandit leader who kidnapped Jones. It is said that the bandit leader is demanding a ransom of 50,000 yuan. Dr. Müller, who escaped danger yesterday, has not yet made any statements today. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to Japanese Deputy Military Attaché Takahashi stationed in P'ing today, the Kwantung Army has ordered the Japanese army in Jehol and the Japanese Military Affairs Group in Changyuan to assist the Chinese authorities in rescuing Mr. Jones.

However, the bandits are demanding a ransom of 50,000 yuan, and it is still unknown whether he can escape danger safely. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Riotous Bandits Attacked Tungchow; The Luho Middle School Was Unsuccessful.</h3>
<p>(Peiping) At around 3:00 AM this morning, there were sudden gunshots in the Tungchow area, saying that a dozen or so riotous bandits attempted to attack the Luho Middle School. Because the school was heavily guarded, they were unsuccessful. Although the residents were alarmed for a time, they have returned to normal. According to another telephone call from Tungchow, at around 3:00 AM this morning, gunshots suddenly rang out quite densely at the North Gate, West Gate, and South Gate of Tungchow. Residents were extremely frightened by the sudden attack by the riotous bandits. By the time the garrison from Nanyuan arrived, the bandits were gone. It is said that the bandits' target was the Luho Middle School, but the school had its own self-defense police, so the bandits were unsuccessful and retreated to the northeast. According to the Luho Middle School police and the railway workers in Tung County, there were very few bandits. Because the Luho Middle School police fought back very hard, the gunshots were very dense. The security of Tung County has returned to normal this morning. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) According to a telephone call from Tung County, a large group of bandits suddenly appeared outside the South Gate of Tung County early on the 30th, attempting to surround Luho Middle School and rob it. A fierce battle broke out with the school's guards. For a time, gunshots rang out loudly, and residents were startled awake from their dreams, fleeing in panic. Later, with the joint attack of the security team and the militia, the bandit forces could not resist and fled into the green gauze tents. Order was not restored until 10:00 AM. (31st Dispatch)</p>

Secretary-General T'ang Yu-jen met them. After the representatives stated that the content of the law placed excessive restrictions on the press, it would be difficult to be effective if only remedial measures were sought in the implementation regulations. They requested a re-determination of principles and submission to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration in order to implement the purpose of supporting public opinion. T'ang said that the Central Political Conference fully understands your intentions and will take into account the opinions of the press in various places. It would be good if remedial measures could be found in the implementing regulations, but if the implementing regulations cannot provide remedies, further discussions will be held on reconsideration.

<h3>Anglo-American Naval Race After the Abolition of the Ratio System</h3>
<p>— Latitude</p>
<p>Today, British foreign policy is thoroughly clear to the world. Britain has always feigned a gentlemanly demeanor and strenuously defended its foreign policy, claiming to seek collective security, to maintain European peace, and, with regard to the Far East, to seek Anglo-American cooperation to maintain peace and tranquility in the Pacific. Previously, figures such as General Smuts of South Africa and Marquis Rhodes had all vigorously promoted Anglo-American cooperation and appealed for peace in the Far East. More recently, even Eden, the Minister without Portfolio in the current cabinet, stated that "obtaining the close cooperation of the United States is the special purpose of the British government." We hear such loud pronouncements and are led to believe that the British government under Conservative Party control is truly a strong supporter of peace in the Far East. However, in reality, the talk of collective security, maintaining European peace, and Far Eastern cooperation are all empty promises that will not be honored. The Anglo-Saxons are, after all, a pragmatic people. When their diplomats were working for peace in Europe, the world generally believed that British foreign policy had abandoned its narrow isolationism. But before long, Britain suddenly broke free from the constraints of the London Agreement and the Stresa Conference, and concluded a naval agreement with Germany, effectively abolishing the naval clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. Britain's move directly abandoned its claim to collective security and returned to the "splendid isolation" advocated by Lord Beaverbrook. Indirectly, it also dealt a major blow to naval limitations. This is a clear fact. This policy, in Britain's view, is naturally cause for self-satisfaction, but internationally, it is enough to stir up dangerous waves. Now, before one wave subsides, another rises. British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell has announced in the British House of Commons the abolition of the naval ratio system. What is the purpose of Britain's move? The abolition of the ratio system is welcomed by Japan but not by the United States. Now, Britain, in deference to Japan's wishes, has publicly announced the abolition of the ratio system, bringing the last vestiges of the Washington Five-Power Naval Limitation Treaty to its final demise. Is Anglo-Japanese cooperation about to revive?</p>
<p>Britain's declaration of abolishing the ratio system is enough to make the naval race among nations more active. This cannot be denied. According to recent news, the United States will build 68 warships in two years. Among those that began construction last year were two aircraft carriers, seven light cruisers, twenty-nine destroyers, and six submarines, totaling forty-four ships. This year, construction will begin on fifteen destroyers and six submarines, totaling twenty-four ships. Active construction of aircraft and the active development of trans-Pacific air routes are also noteworthy. At the same time, Britain's expansion of its navy will certainly not lag behind. Reuter's news reports that Britain plans to spend 150 million pounds to build new warships. The planned additions include fifty to seventy-two cruisers, eighty-four to one hundred destroyers, thirty-nine to fifty-two submarines, and eight to ten aircraft carriers. The naval competition between the two Anglo-Saxon nations, while their union is certainly sufficient to deal with their common enemies, their antagonism is equally sufficient to give ambitious individuals an opportunity to exploit. However, from the perspective of the facts, the situation of antagonism is far greater than that of union. Is this fortunate for Britain and the United States? Or is it unfortunate for the Far East? At present, it is not something we can foresee.</p>
<h3>British Economic Expert Sir Arthur Salter to Visit China</h3>
<p>(London) It is reported that Sir Arthur Salter will travel to China with an expert from the Bank of England. Salter's trip is without any preconceived notions. He has been studying Chinese affairs for several weeks, but does not wish to predetermine any plans before arriving in China. British individuals involved with China are continuing to study various methods to assist China. Public opinion generally believes that the necessary conditions include reducing military spending and reorganizing debt credit. Many emphasize the importance of seeking Japanese cooperation. Observations of the Japanese official stance on loans to China suggest that they believe it is neither necessary nor timely at present. (Reuter's Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Yalu River Flooding: Extraordinary Disaster in Antung, Unseen in Sixty Years; Over 10,000 Houses Flooded; Refugees Wail for Rescue</h3>
<p>Antung: The Yalu River's water level increased even further, reaching 28 feet at 9:00 PM on the 30th, a new record in sixty years. At 10:00 PM, 3,351 houses were flooded in Shin-Gishu. Emergency bells rang loudly across the river to both cities, their sound extremely mournful. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Antung: In Antung City, the water level was 24 feet at 6:00 PM on the 30th. Houses of all sizes collapsed one after another, with 15,000 houses flooded, causing losses of 10 million yuan. The city of Nakashima, between Antung and Shin-Gishu, was 21 feet under water. 1,500 residents have been rescued, but 4,500 remain in the area. The water level is gradually increasing, and houses are continuing to be washed away. Due to the rapid currents, rescue boats cannot operate. Refugees are wailing for help in the darkness, their situation extremely dire. (Japan United Press Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Thanks to the efforts of the garrison, the "Manchukuo" army, Japanese and Manchukuo police teams, and defense corps in Shenyang City, the embankments of the Hun River continue to be fortified, avoiding a flood. However, in the suburbs, over a thousand houses of Manchus have been flooded. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Bartholomew Appointed Commander of British Forces in China; Repeatedly Decorated During the European War; to Arrive in China at the End of the Year to Assume Office</h3>
<p>(London) The War Office announced that it has appointed Lieutenant General Bartholomew as Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in China, succeeding Lieutenant General Paget.

He is currently 57 years old. (Reuter's Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Distributing Pamphlet; Attempting to Disrupt Control; Army Minister Hayashi Reports to Prince Kan'in; Decides to Strictly Enforce Military Regulations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi suddenly visited Hakone Mountain on the 30th to meet with Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in, and then went to Hayama to meet with the Emperor, reporting on internal army affairs, attracting considerable attention from various quarters. It is investigated that the content of the Army Minister's report concerns a pamphlet jointly written by Captain Kōtarō Muranaka and First Class Paymaster Asaichi Isobe, who were ordered to be suspended from their positions during the previous change of the Inspector General of Military Education. The pamphlet, entitled "Opinion on the Shaw Army," has been distributed to various quarters, with the army investigating its number to be over 3,000 copies. Army Minister Hayashi met with Inspector General Watanabe on the evening of the 29th to discuss countermeasures. Because the pamphlet exposes the contents of the so-called October Incident and March Incident, attempting to disrupt army control, it was decided to strictly enforce military regulations. Therefore, after determining the method of punishment, the Chief of Staff was reported. (Japan United Press Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the change of the Inspector General of Military Education, pamphlets and opinions on the army, drafted by the military or other names, have been distributed to various quarters. The content contains many inappropriate and distorted aspects of the army. The Army Central Department has investigated the actual situation and studied the aftermath. It has now been discovered that it was issued by a certain officer who was implicated in a certain incident last autumn. It has been decided to order the relevant authorities to confiscate the pamphlets in question and, within a day or two, punish the active duty officers involved.

<h3>League of Nations Council Meeting Filled with Tension; Britain and France Join Forces to Stifle East African Warfare; New Proposals to Italy Based on Treaties; Italy Opposes Placing Abyssinia Under League of Nations Trusteeship</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Geneva is filled with tension this morning, as the League of Nations Council meeting, watched by the entire world, is scheduled to convene here today, possibly becoming the most serious meeting since the League's founding. Council President Litvinov arrived here last night from Carlsbad, followed by the Italian delegation led by Sir Aloisi, with only a few hours between them. Sir Anthony Eden and Prime Minister Laval are expected to arrive this morning, allowing sufficient time for preliminary talks before the meeting commences at 5:00 PM today. The League is paying attention to the attitudes of the various national representatives on procedural matters, namely, whether the Council should only mediate or directly intervene. The second method would likely cause the Italian representative to withdraw from the meeting. It is rumored that Britain will insist on discussing the root causes of the conflict. If a compromise cannot be reached, it can obtain the assistance of Austria, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, etc. However, the South American representatives will likely remain strictly neutral. Some quarters predict that Litvinov and the Turkish representative will suggest that both Italy and Abyssinia should reaffirm their commitment to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and Article 5 of the 1928 Italo-Ethiopian Treaty, which stipulates that all disputes should be submitted to mediation. (National Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met with British Minister without Portfolio Anthony Eden. The two exchanged impressions gained from their talks with representatives from Italy and Abyssinia this morning. Laval and Eden seem to have reached an agreement on the attitude to be adopted at the League of Nations Council meeting at 5:00 PM today. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of the countries participating in the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council, including the French delegation led by French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, arrived here at 9:00 AM this morning. British Minister without Portfolio Anthony Eden also arrived at the same time. Prime Minister Laval immediately went to the offices of the French delegation to meet with representatives of the member states of the Council. These contacts were arranged in advance by the staff. The first meeting of the Council is still scheduled for 5:00 PM this afternoon, and it will be strictly private. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of the countries participating in the League of Nations Council meeting have arrived here together today, preparing to make a final effort to avoid an Italo-Ethiopian war. The representatives are also preparing to demand that Italy allow the process of peaceful negotiations to continue without resorting to armed attacks on Abyssinia. Currently, the greatest hope of the representatives is only to delay the final break, and they do not hope to resolve the fundamental issues. This is indeed noteworthy. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) As a result of talks between British Cabinet Minister Eden and French Prime Minister Laval in Paris yesterday, there is now a new move to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. A method has been proposed to Rome today, advocating the establishment of a small committee of representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and Abyssinia to meet and study the overall situation based on the 1906 treaty. Italy would undertake not to take hostile actions while these talks continue. The above proposal may be welcomed by the member states of the League of Nations, as they can avoid involvement in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and make the major powers take full responsibility. It is investigated that the 1906 treaty stipulated that Britain, France, and Italy were responsible for (1) respecting and seeking to preserve Abyssinia's territorial integrity; (2) industrial concessions obtained by any party should not harm the rights of other countries; (3) not interfering in Abyssinia's internal affairs; (4) acting jointly to protect each other's interests in territories bordering Abyssinia; (5) agreeing on the construction of railways within Abyssinia and equal treatment of the three countries' people in trade and transportation. (Reuter's Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Eden's Behind-the-Scenes Activities; Hopes for Peace Remain Slim</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Cabinet Minister Eden visited Abyssinian representative Haile Haywarte, the Abyssinian minister to France, at 11:00 AM this morning, accompanied by a French advisor. At noon, Eden visited Italian representative Aloisi, and later had lunch with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. Although the Italo-Abyssinian dispute has not been formally discussed in meetings, there have been many talks behind the scenes. It is heard that the talks are progressing well, but it is too early to say that hopes are high. The idea that Italy would accept the League of Nations' assignment of an arbitrator to join the mediation committee is now generally disbelieved. Eden wants to do something to appease public opinion, letting them know that the League of Nations Council does not want to focus solely on unimportant border details and forget the main issues.</p>
<p>Rome Considers League of Nations Trusteeship of Abyssinia a Strange Tale</p>
<p>According to Rome dispatches, the League of Nations Council meeting today may be delayed, as it is heard that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has continued to work towards various peaceful solutions. According to the latest news from Rome, the Italian Prime Minister is now prepared to abandon his opposition to the League of Nations appointing a fifth arbitrator. However, if the mediation procedures ultimately fail, Italy reserves the right to detail its reasons when the Council meets. Italy will continue to refuse to make such statements at this session of the League of Nations Council. As for the idea of making Abyssinia a protectorate of the League of Nations, Rome does not welcome it, considering it a strange tale. The biggest reason for Italy's opposition is that Britain and France have great influence in the League of Nations and will have great power in the administration of the League of Nations' protectorate in the future, which cannot satisfy Italy. Moreover, this move is practically equivalent to the three signatory countries of the 1906 treaty establishing a mixed Anglo-French-Italian protectorate.</p>
<p>Regard the Treaty as Scrap Paper; Unwilling to Let Other Countries Share the Spoils</p>
<p>It is investigated that the Italian Prime Minister has long regarded this treaty as scrap paper. Italy has already progressed far in Abyssinia and is unwilling to let other countries share its benefits. Italy wants to control the raw materials it lacks, which is also one of its main ambitions for Abyssinia. Italy's *Tribuna* published an illustration today, expressing the feelings of hatred among Italians. The drawing depicts a barefoot Abyssinian under the Geneva negotiating table, befriending the leg of a trouser-clad Englishman. (Reuter's Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Wartime Blockade of the Canal; Representatives Discuss</p>
<p>(Paris) According to sources here, the representatives attending the League of Nations Council meeting today actively discussed methods to block the Suez Canal and prohibit Italian or other countries' ships from transporting munitions after the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian war. It is likely that the Council will authorize Britain or various countries to organize a committee to prohibit munitions from any country heading to any location from passing through the Suez Canal. (National Telegram, 31st)</p>
<h3>Britain and France's Stance Closer Than Before; Results of Talks Between Eden and Laval</h3>
<p>(London) According to Reuter's dispatches from Paris, Britain and France's stance on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is now closer than it was three weeks ago. This is the result of yesterday's one-hour talks between the two important figures, Eden and Laval. The two thoroughly discussed all aspects of the issue. Today, Eden has gone to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Council meeting. (Reuter's Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is heard that after the talks between Eden and Laval in Paris yesterday, there has been a change in Britain's position. Britain originally requested that the League of Nations Council immediately discuss the entire Italo-Ethiopian dispute to avoid the increasing danger of war. However, after Laval's advice, Britain's stance is no longer as firm as before. Laval believes that as long as there is still a glimmer of hope for a peaceful resolution, the procedure advocated by Britain is not necessary, as the Council's resolution of May 25th already stipulated that the Italo-Ethiopian dispute should not be discussed in its entirety until all conciliation procedures have completely failed. Although the British government has not completely decided to adopt the French view due to general public opinion at home, the fact that Britain and France can cooperate further makes the prospects for the Council meeting more optimistic. It is likely that Eden will make a final decision on Britain's attitude after holding talks with important representatives of the countries attending the Council. However, in any case, the postponement of discussion on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute without a guarantee to prevent war will be firmly opposed by Britain. Furthermore, the greatest difficulty at present lies in Abyssinia, as the Abyssinian government insists that the Council immediately discuss the entire issue and refuses to accept the resumption of the Italo-Ethiopian arbitration committee. However, although Abyssinia insists on this position, it is still generally believed that if Abyssinia's security can be guaranteed, the Abyssinian government may be expected to accept a conciliatory method, and the guarantee of Abyssinia's security is also what Britain hopes for. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Entrusted to League of Nations Governance; British and French Talks Consider This; London Official Statements Deny It</h3>
<p>(London) Today, *The Times* published a Paris dispatch stating that Minister without Portfolio Eden and French Foreign Minister Laval had considered making Abyssinia a League of Nations mandated territory. Officials here have denied this claim. (Havas Agency Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) According to *The Times*' Paris correspondent, Minister without Portfolio Eden and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval have considered a solution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute: not to have Abyssinia make sovereignty-damaging concessions directly to Italy, but rather to have the League of Nations, as the protector of Abyssinia's freedom and rights and the guarantor of European interests, accept Abyssinia's concessions. Britain and France intend to declare to the Abyssinian government that Abyssinia is a member of the League of Nations and has the obligations it should oversee. If the country cannot reorganize its internal affairs on its own, the League of Nations should step in to help. This concept is now being materialized, intending to make Abyssinia a mandated territory of the member states of the League of Nations, with a High Commissioner exercising governing power, whose position would be similar to the League of Nations High Commissioner to Danzig. Then, Abyssinia would grant Italy local concessions, but the power of governance would still be held by the League of Nations. At the same time, the League of Nations would act as Abyssinia's protector and provide financial assistance in exchange. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>(London) It is now suggested that the League of Nations should administer Abyssinia on its behalf, in order to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. This plan has been communicated to the Ethiopian King from undisclosed sources, advocating that the League of Nations grant Italy special economic concessions, with the understanding that it will protect Abyssinia from foreign aggression. According to the Reuter's correspondent in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian King has only expressed gratitude. However, the King told a person who met with him that he had no objection to the principle of European power, as long as it was purely economic. The Ethiopian people would rather prosper under European guidance than be independent and impoverished.</p>
<p>British colonial expert Mr. Bell wrote to *The Times*, supporting this proposal, saying that the League of Nations should declare a temporary mandate over Abyssinia, allowing Italy's legitimate grievances and rights to be fulfilled. (Reuter's Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris) *Le Matin* received news from London stating that a new proposal has been made to the Abyssinian government, advocating that the League of Nations entrust European countries to jointly govern the country, while granting Italy economic interests but not granting it political or territorial privileges. The Abyssinian Emperor can freely select advisors from among the member states of the League of Nations to assist in governance. It is heard that the Abyssinian Emperor has replied that Abyssinia does not oppose the power of European countries, but that it should be purely economic. For Abyssinia's sake, it is better to prosper under the guidance of European countries than to be impoverished under complete independence. However, *Le Matin*'s correspondent did not indicate from whom this new proposal came. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Prepares for War</h3>
<p>People with Guns Facing Outward; Strong Anti-Italian Sentiment</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Abyssinia is currently in a state of war frenzy. One million Abyssinians are now preparing for war, sharpening their swords and cleaning their guns, ready to fight. Even children are learning to wield swords and fire guns, and women are also preparing to replace men in their duties when they go to war. Italian expatriates are leaving the country one after another. Several officials from the Italian legation returned home yesterday, escorted by guards from the legation, because the Abyssinians have extremely strong anti-Italian sentiments. There is currently only one Italian woman in Addis Ababa. The Italian envoy's refusal to attend the Ethiopian King's birthday celebration is seen as a major insult by the Abyssinians. Some quarters are now demanding a severance of relations with Italy. However, the Ethiopian King wants an honorable peace, and this strategy is supported by the masses. Therefore, as far as Abyssinia is concerned, the Ethiopian King is now the master of the situation. According to reliable sources, the entire Abyssinian territory unanimously supports the Ethiopian King's proposition that, in times of national crisis, all men and women, regardless of their religion, should defend Abyssinia against foreign aggression. People here currently know nothing about the views of the League of Nations and the great powers. (Reuter's Dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3>Italy Excludes Great Powers from Involvement in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Holds Firm Resolve to Military Occupation; Willing to Implement an Egyptian System of Governance</p>
<p>(London) Someone asked the Italian authorities for their opinion on the plan for a protectorate. The answer was that this is not enough to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Mussolini recently stated that it is impossible for any country or great power to implement a protectorate over Abyssinia. The Italian view is that Italy must militarily occupy Abyssinia. (Reuter's Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) Mussolini's newspaper *Il Popolo d'Italia* published an article suggesting that Abyssinia should implement a system of governance similar to that of Egypt, saying that this is honorable for Abyssinia, as Egypt is an ancient civilization, while Abyssinia was historically rife with barbarism. (Reuter's Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Italy Busy Transporting Troops and Armaments; Over a Hundred Ships in May; Passing Through the Suez Canal</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to reliable sources, in the recent month of May, Italy transported troops and armaments to East Africa, with 179 ships passing through the Suez Canal. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) According to Reuter's correspondent in Rome, General Graziani, the commander of the Italian forces in East Africa, issued a proclamation in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, denouncing those who spread rumors, saying that if anyone expresses dissatisfaction with the colonial system, they will be immediately deported back to their country after being identified. At the same time, General Bōno, the Italian commissioner stationed in Eritrea, has established a special court and issued a declaration, stating that Italy has no issue of requisitioning land from the natives. The arrival of Italians there is solely for the development of the colony for the benefit of the masses. General Bōno has also established a bonus system, with the hope that those who serve diligently will be rewarded. (Reuter's Dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Haile Haywarte, the chief representative of Abyssinia attending the League of Nations Council meeting, spoke with Tokyo by long-distance telephone today before the Council meeting.

<h3>European Cooperation Faces Acid Test: French Newspaper Expresses Optimism</h3>
<p>(Paris) "Le Temps" published a commentary studying the possibility of the League of Nations Council handling the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, stating that "The primary task of this Council meeting is to safeguard the future of the League of Nations and prevent the Italo-Ethiopian dispute from breaking down in Geneva. Keeping the green hills is more important than worrying about firewood. In this respect, the current trend seems quite optimistic. There seems to be a hope for compromise on the points of contention among the countries involved. Even if Britain believes that to maintain the authority and reputation of the League of Nations, it is necessary to expand the scope of the Council's discussion and conduct a comprehensive review of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, it would be more appropriate for the League of Nations Council to first restore the work of the Italo-Ethiopian Arbitration Committee and then wait for the opportunity to make a final decision. Britain will soon understand this point. The League of Nations Council's gradual discussion of the entire dispute is not a deliberate delay or missed opportunity. On the contrary, only with ample time can a peaceful solution be sought. To what extent the Italo-Ethiopian dispute poses a danger to general peace will only be seen in the coming weeks. In summary, if all the countries involved have good will and a spirit of compromise, there is no difficult political problem that cannot be solved. This Council meeting may be a major test of cooperation and peace policies." (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>

It is heard that the ambassador will submit his resignation on the occasion of this return to make way for younger generations.

<h3>German Military Academy Principal Predicts Future War Scenarios: Mobilization Must Strive for Speed: Surprise Attack Without Declaration of War</h3>
<p>German Sengcheng: Lieutenant Colonel Siebel, principal of the Sengcheng Military Academy in Germany, recently gave a speech to 2,000 university students, predicting the situation of future wars. He said: "Future wars will be wars of all-out struggle, and mobilization must strive for speed, so that once war is declared, all units are properly deployed, and even begin contact without waiting for a declaration of war. All fighter planes, bombers, motorcycle artillery, and long-range artillery will immediately begin fighting in the border areas, while using powerful radio stations to broadcast to the enemy to disrupt their morale. The main task of the war is to strike the enemy's heartland before the enemy country has fully mobilized the defense equipment prepared after the war, and to conquer it in one fell swoop. At the start of the war, the country should promulgate laws to concentrate all national power, solicit all scientific inventions and new technologies for war purposes, and conscript national scientists to assist the country in its operations day and night."

<h3>British-American Cooperation: Stabilize International Currencies: Morgan Visits Downing Street: Generally Believed to Be Related to This Matter</h3>
<p>(London) The idea that the world's major financial countries will find ways to stabilize currencies is becoming more powerful here today, because American banker and former Treasury Secretary Morgan met with Prime Minister Baldwin.

<h3>The Issue of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in the Dutch East Indies: The Progress of Negotiations by the Envoy. The Focus of Negotiations is on the Legal Status of Overseas Chinese and Restrictions on Entry. The Dutch Side Has Already Provided a Formal Response on the Issue of Legal Treatment.</h3>
<p>Text of a Note to the Dutch Government: Our envoy to the Netherlands, Mr. Jin Wensi, sent a note to the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, Graeff, regarding issues such as restrictions on Chinese immigrants in the Dutch East Indies, stating: (1) Regarding the matter of this note, concerning the recently submitted measures to the Dutch East Indies Parliament for restricting immigration, I, as the envoy of my country, hereby provide a more detailed explanation of the views of my government to Your Excellency the Minister. The Consul General of my country in Batavia has, under the instructions of my government, repeatedly met with the Secretary-General of the Dutch Governor-General. Furthermore, the Chargé d'Affaires of my country in the Netherlands also sent two letters to Your Excellency the Minister on June 29 and August 22 of this year, requesting that the government of your country consider the views of my government, hoping that the restrictive measures submitted to the National Assembly at that time would not be passed, or that, even if passed, other measures more favorable to the Chinese than the average quota could be used as the standard for restriction. To this end, I, as the envoy, have also held repeated negotiations with Your Excellency the Minister and the Director in charge of Your Excellency's Ministry. Moreover, during my meeting with Your Excellency the Minister on September 6 of this year, Your Excellency the Minister stated that a response would be provided immediately to the aforementioned two letters. A note was sent on November 18 of this year requesting Your Excellency the Minister to expedite the response. (2) I, as the envoy, have repeatedly received reports from various consulates of my country in the Dutch East Indies, learning that these restrictive immigration measures, after being passed by the National Assembly on September 6 of this year, have been submitted to the government of your country for approval, in the form of amendments and supplementary clauses to the Edict of October 15, 1915, as amended by the Edict of April 21, 1931. (3) I, as the envoy, hereby explain the views of my government on the following points: In recent years, the government of my country has not ignored the special difficulties encountered in the Dutch East Indies. On the other hand, it seems that one of the reasons for the new clauses passed by the National Assembly is to safeguard the existing economic interests of the Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies, and that the implementation of these clauses will not unduly hinder the interests of the Chinese. This is another argument. (4) However, it must be pointed out that there is a long-standing and close relationship between the Dutch East Indies and the Chinese community. Any measures to restrict the subsequent migration of Chinese will inevitably have an unfortunate impact on the interests of the Chinese and the Dutch East Indies. For hundreds of years, the Chinese have worked hard to create enormous and important interests of an economic nature, which have become an inseparable part of the economic life of the Dutch East Indies since ancient times. This is an undeniable fact. It must also be pointed out that in several uncivilized areas of the East Indies, the Chinese have developed these areas through arduous efforts. If Chinese immigrants to the Indies are subject to restrictions, the freedom to choose hardworking young people from our country to assist in maintaining or improving existing businesses, or in establishing new businesses, will be stripped or diminished by these restrictions. Moreover, there are still many undeveloped areas in the Malay Archipelago. If Chinese immigration is restricted, it will inevitably hinder the development of these areas, which will be detrimental to the interests of China, the Netherlands, and the Dutch East Indies. (5) Moreover, the Chinese have never harbored any political intentions in migrating to the Dutch East Indies since ancient times. This restrictive immigration measure seems even more unnecessary for the Chinese. The Chinese who reside there support themselves and contribute to public happiness and prosperity, obeying local laws to live peacefully. Our interests are of the most important and purely economic or commercial nature. Moreover, it is sometimes said that our residence in the Dutch East Indies is in economic competition with the indigenous people, but this is not the case in reality. The Chinese do not own land in the Dutch East Indies. The agriculture of West Borneo has been improved through our efforts, which has greatly benefited indigenous landowners. (Omitted content) (6) In addition to the aforementioned practical points, this issue of immigration restrictions has also attracted the deep attention of the Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, during the meetings of the National Assembly, respected members representing the interests of the Chinese strongly requested that the proposed measures be reconsidered. Even after the assembly passed the measures, thirty Chinese chambers of commerce in various ports of the Dutch East Indies, despite knowing that the case had passed, jointly submitted a petition to the Governor-General on October 28 of this year, requesting further consideration. This is sufficient to demonstrate the deep concern of the Chinese about this matter, which is shared by my government and the Chinese in my country and elsewhere. This is also what I, as the envoy, wish to add. (7) Regarding the section on the equal distribution of annual quotas for each ethnic group, while the purpose is to ensure equal and fair treatment for each ethnic group, it is feared that in practice, the situation of the Chinese will be much more unfavorable than that of other ethnic groups. This should not be ignored. From 1923 to 1932, the average number of Chinese immigrants to the Dutch East Indies accounted for 76% of the total number of immigrants from all ethnic groups. Now, 24% of foreign ethnic groups are being allocated the same annual immigration quota as the 76% of Chinese. The unfairness of this seems clear. Upon investigation, Section 1 of Article 18 of the new regulations stipulates that if the actual number of immigrants in any year is lower than the total number stipulated, each ethnic group may increase its immigration to one-tenth of the total number of immigrants from that ethnic group in the ten years prior to the implementation of the new regulations. Leaving aside the rarity of such circumstances, even the content of this provision is difficult to adapt to the needs of the Chinese. Moreover, there are difficulties in how to apply this provision. In my view, the shortfall in any year cannot be known until after that year has passed. Once it is known, there is no way to make up for it in other countries. Therefore, there must be a provision that allows the shortfall of one ethnic group in the previous year to be made up for by another ethnic group in the following year. (8) In view of the various reasons mentioned above, the government of my country cannot but hope that your government and the government of the Dutch East Indies will take a special attitude towards the issue of immigration. I, as the envoy, hereby invoke the various statements made by the representatives of the Dutch East Indies government at the meeting of the National Assembly on September 6 of this year. The main point of these statements was that people with assets or industrial knowledge and experience are welcome to enter the country, and that, for the sake of developing certain industries, a fixed number of workers may be allowed to enter the country, exceeding the prescribed annual quota. Furthermore, the new regulations are a pioneering undertaking, and the Dutch East Indies government is prepared to carefully examine the political and economic aspects of the implementation of these regulations. If, in practice, experience shows that it is necessary to adopt other methods, it will not hesitate to do so. (9) Therefore, I, as the envoy, hereby submit this note to Your Excellency the Minister to supplement the two previous letters from my embassy on June 29 and August 22. I, as the envoy, am convinced that regardless of the reasons for these new regulations, once these reasons no longer exist, the government of your country will change its attitude towards this matter. Therefore, I, as the envoy, request to reserve the right to raise this issue again at an appropriate time in the future. At the same time, I request Your Excellency the Minister to inform the government of your country in the East Indies of the contents of this note, hoping that the Governor-General of the East Indies will consider the views of the Chinese government when stipulating the annual quota for immigration, and will adopt measures deemed necessary to make the various provisions of Section 1 of Article 18 mentioned above practicable, or to facilitate their implementation, and to enable the various statements made by the representatives of the Dutch East Indies government in the National Assembly to be implemented. Respectfully requesting your consideration. Jin Wensi, Envoy of the Republic of China to the Netherlands, December 14, Year 23."</p>
<p>Reply Note from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied, "Regarding the inquiry in Letter No. 769 from the Chinese Embassy on March 31 of last year, concerning the legal treatment of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies and elsewhere, the Ministry hereby respectfully responds to the aforementioned letter as follows: The legal status of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies can be said to be equal to that of Europeans. A portion of the laws there allows Overseas Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies to be subject to the laws previously applied to Europeans, while another portion is completely newly established and applies to all ethnic groups without any discrimination. Therefore, the legal status of Overseas Chinese is similar to that of Europeans. For example, civil law, commercial law, civil procedure law, and the most important part, criminal law, do not differentiate between Europeans and Chinese. In addition, there are laws specifically for Chinese, and special circumstances among Overseas Chinese (such as adoption). Even Europeans in the East Indies once had such laws. From this, it can be seen that the government of the Dutch East Indies is now striving to ensure equal treatment for all people. On the one hand, the Dutch East Indies government will continue in this direction, striving to eliminate disparities that are unsuitable for the new era, while on the other hand, it will retain any remaining disparities between ethnic groups that are necessary. Based on the aforementioned principles, the Dutch East Indies government has been studying the improvement of criminal procedure for a long time, because there are still disparities between ethnic groups in this matter. This shows that the principles of peace repeatedly declared by the government are still being pursued. However, the complex nature of this endeavor and the technical (legal expertise) difficulties do not allow us to complete it all at once, but only in several stages. The order of priority and the timing must be determined by the local government according to the situation. One point that must be paid particular attention to as to why it must be done in stages is to avoid financial sacrifices. Progress on criminal procedure law has been shown in two ways: Firstly, not long ago, the criminal procedures for Europeans were simplified (as published in the Dutch East Indies Legal Gazette Nos. 460, 580, and 581 in 1932). Secondly, the criminal procedures of the local courts are non-discriminatory for all ethnic groups. The government hopes that it will be able to continue its efforts to improve criminal procedure in the future. The government is very pleased to be confident that improvements will be achieved in accordance with the above principles, which the government regards as its sole goal, to satisfy the desires of all the people of the Dutch East Indies. Graeff, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, May 2, 1934." (End)</p>
<h3>Flood Statistics in Anhui Province: Over 410,000 Mu of Farmland Flooded, Losses Estimated at Around 6 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Before the beginning of last month, Anhui Province had experienced a prolonged drought in various counties, with drought conditions reported in each county. However, in less than ten days, continuous rainfall caused the river water to rise sharply, flowing down torrentially, coupled with flash floods. The dikes along the river in various counties were in imminent danger. It is estimated that 78 dikes have collapsed due to the inability of manpower to resist. According to statistics from the Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, over 410,000 mu of farmland have been flooded, with the value of crop losses estimated at 15 yuan per mu, totaling around 6 million yuan. The number of houses, livestock, and sundries swept away is not included. Breaking it down by county, Huaining County had 11 dikes collapse, flooding over 86,000 mu, affecting over 55,000 people. Tongcheng County had 7 dikes collapse, flooding over 19,000 mu, affecting over 13,000 people. Wangjiang County had 21 dikes collapse, flooding over 111,000 mu, affecting over 88,000 people. Susong County had 6 dikes collapse, flooding over 14,000 mu, affecting over 9,000 people. Dongliu County had 5 dikes collapse, flooding over 15,000 mu, affecting over 7,000 people. Tongling County had 2 dikes collapse, flooding over 41,000 mu, affecting over 34,000 people. Fanchang County had 6 dikes collapse, flooding over 32,000 mu, affecting over 29,000 people. Nanling County had 6 dikes collapse, flooding over 8,900 mu, affecting over 9,000 people. Wuhu County had 9 dikes collapse, flooding over 33,000 mu, affecting over 13,000 people. Guichi County had 2 dikes collapse, and flash floods caused flooding of over 23,000 mu, affecting over 16,000 people. Dangtu County had 2 dikes collapse, flooding over 23,600 mu, affecting over 13,000 people. In Zhide County, farmland along the lake and river was flooded by tidal backflow, with the number of mu lost unknown. In Qianshan County, flash floods in Xingjiu Township along the two banks caused flooding of over 5,000 mu, affecting over 3,000 people. In total, 13 counties are affected, with over 300,000 victims. The survivors are extremely poor and have no one to turn to, and are only groaning and haggard under the scorching sun and hot wind, their suffering is unspeakable. To organize urgent relief, a minimum of three yuan per person is needed, requiring no less than eight or nine hundred thousand yuan. In addition, repairing dikes and organizing work relief will require over one million yuan. The Provincial Disaster Relief Committee has already consulted with the provincial government to finalize a work relief plan, and has also submitted a report to the Central Relief Committee, requesting that the disaster in Anhui Province be listed together with the provinces upstream, such as Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and that 800,000 yuan be allocated for urgent work relief to help the victims. The provincial government has also received an order from Chairman Chiang, instructing the three departments of civil affairs, finance, and construction to consult and form a General Anhui Flood Relief Association, modeled after the successful case of Jiangsu Province, first establishing a general affairs and flood control group, to be undertaken separately by the departments of civil affairs and construction, to save costs. The three departments of civil affairs, finance, and construction have jointly drafted the organizational regulations of the association and submitted them to the provincial government for approval and implementation.

<h3>Jining: The Zhao Wang River Breached Again - The Water is Vast and Spreading North -</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Nanyang, Hunanwang, and Wanghu Lakes in Jining were unable to contain the continuous inflow from the He Yong Irrigation Canal. The Wang Guitun Dike in Xinian first breached, and the water has flowed to the Xin Tiao River. The lower reaches of the Grand Canal also cannot discharge the water due to the rising water level and rapid flow. At the breached area of the eastern dike near Xindian, the water has reached the base of the Jining-Yanzhou Railway branch line. Yesterday, the Zhao Wang River in Jining County suddenly breached again, and the entire Jining County was flooded. The water level of the Zhao Wang River had already reached the canal bank, and on the 28th, it suddenly rose another four inches. The surrounding area was all water, and there was no place to get soil for emergency protection. The dikes continued to collapse. On the 29th, the water level rose another two inches, and the water became even greater. The northern dike east of Tangjiakou and west of Liangqiao was breached in two places, each over ten feet wide. The overflowing water mixed with the sloping water from the Wang Guitun breach and passed through the Jining-Jiaxiang automobile road. The water level is now increasing continuously and there is a danger of it overflowing the road and continuing to spread north. Jining County Magistrate Zhen Guangyuan has telegraphed a report. The water levels in other counties are still high, and the houses have been completely collapsing after prolonged soaking. Inspector Wang Shaochang has telegraphed a report that over ten thousand victims have been continuously arriving in Jining waiting for trains to transport them to various counties for shelter. The provincial government allocated four more trains on the 29th for transportation. The fifth and sixth batches of victims who arrived in Jinan on the 28th were transported to Dezhou (1,200 people) and Pingyuan and Yucheng (750 people each) on the 29th. After the counties are filled with refugees, they will be transported to counties along the Jiaoji Railway for shelter and relief. (July 29)</p>
<p>Songjiang: Verdict on a Large Gambling Den in Songhui Village</p>
<p>The large gambling den at No. 8 Songhui Village in this city, after being raided by the Public Security Bureau, resulted in the arrest of thirteen gamblers, but the ringleader escaped and has not been apprehended. The county government has sealed off the ringleader's house, pending apprehension for further investigation. All thirteen gamblers and gambling money of 320 yuan were sent to the local court. After investigation by the prosecutor's office, a clear indictment was filed in the corresponding criminal court. Yesterday, the court convened, but the defendants did not appear in court and jointly appointed lawyer Zhu Shanqing to defend them. It was verified that the verdict would be announced on the 31st. The text of the announced verdict is now disclosed: Wang Yongsheng, also known as Li Hongsheng; Li Ersheng, also known as Lu ; Wang Benyuan, also known as Fang Benyuan; Wang Pinzhu, also known as Fang Pinzhu Da Dayuan; Wang Boyuan; Xu Erquan, also known as Ye Wenqing; Wang Sizhi, also known as Wang Shenlin; Wu Guisheng; Ye Baozhen, also known as Geng Haoqin, were all found guilty of gambling for money in a public place and were each fined 300 yuan. If they are unable to pay the fine, they will be sentenced to one day of labor for every three yuan. Gambling paraphernalia such as mahjong tiles, playing cards, chips, and dice were confiscated. Since the crackdown on this large gambling den, smaller gambling dens have successively disappeared.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Rioters in Shengze Smash the Business Tax Bureau</p>
<p>Due to dissatisfaction with the Business Tax Bureau's dispatch of personnel to investigate accounts, the rice industry in Shengze Town, Wujiang County, went on strike on the 29th. It is learned that on the morning of the 30th, dozens of villagers, unable to purchase grain, went to the town to petition. The town's Chamber of Commerce and district office and other agencies immediately summoned four representatives of the rice industry, including Yan Fu, to hold a meeting for investigation and mediation. The rice industry, considering the matter involved the people's food, accepted the mediation and agreed to resume business at 2 pm that afternoon. The villagers were also satisfied and dispersed. However, at noon that day, dozens of rioters suddenly rushed into the town's Business Tax Bureau, arbitrarily causing trouble and smashing objects. The responsible Public Security Sub-bureau immediately dispatched police to suppress them, but because the number of rioters was large, the police dispatched to suppress them were mostly beaten by the rioters. The rioters even rushed to the Public Security Bureau and smashed the doors and windows before leaving. Whether there is a background to this matter is still unknown. Afterwards, the director of the Business Tax Bureau, Gao Yuncheng, and the provincial commissioner, He Fuzong, both went to the province to request instructions. Wujiang County Magistrate Xu sent Section Chief Tang, together with Public Security Director Zheng and Security Team Captain Yang, leading a detachment of the Security Team, to Shengze at dawn yesterday (31st) to suppress the situation and investigate the truth of the rioters' riot. County Magistrate Xu also telegraphed the Department of Civil Affairs to request instructions.</p>

<p>Wuxi: Journalists' Association Calls for Revision of New Publication Law</p>
<p>The Wuxi Journalists' Association, advocating for the Central Government to reconsider and revise the Publication Law, held its third special committee meeting yesterday (30th) at 4:00 PM. Committee members Sun Dexian, Yuan Hegao, Zhang Xiyin, Chen Hongjun, Hua E, Sun Chunpu, Shi Qinglin, Sun Xiangfeng, Yang Chusun, and eight others attended. Six lawyers, Zou Binghu, Zhou Beiwu, Tang Ying, Zhang Tong, Wang Tinghuai, and Zhou Jiapu, were invited to attend and provide preliminary advice. Chairman Sun Dexian reported that the Legislative Yuan had passed amendments to the Publication Law, restricting the industry and hindering its development. Two special committee meetings were held on July 10th and 16th, resolving to submit separate petitions to various central government departments, seeking relief, and issuing a declaration regarding the defamation charges against three newspapers in the Caoqiao murder case. A month had passed, and the draft petitions and declarations had been prepared, but they were repeatedly delayed due to seeking opinions from legal experts and revisions. Colleagues in Shanghai and other regions had already voiced their concerns. This association initiated the process early but has fallen behind. Today's meeting aims to discuss and research this matter together.</p>
<p>After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) Revise the petition: (a) (Omitted); (b) Regarding the points of non-punishment for defamation due to negligence and the triple penalty for one offense in the Publication Law and Criminal Law, request clarification and request that the implementing regulations of the Publication Law explicitly stipulate that journalists' negligent acts, in addition to being sanctioned by the Publication Law, should not be punished under the Criminal Law; (c) Still request the Central Political Council and the Legislative Yuan to reconsider and revise the Publication Law; (d) Publicly recommend Yang Chusun to draft a telegram, and distribute it to colleagues nationwide, urging them to advocate for a unified position (original text recorded below); (2) The petition will be released immediately, and representatives will be sent to Jingjiang, Jiangyin, Yixing, Liyang, Wuxian, Wujin, Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Changshu, and other counties to seek signatures; (3) (Omitted); (4) The association will send letters to colleagues in various counties of Jiangsu Province, recommending representatives to jointly petition in Beijing, gathering in Wuxi on August 9th and departing early on the 10th; (5) (6) (Omitted). At approximately 6:00 PM, tea and snacks were served, and the meeting adjourned. The telegram is recorded as follows: To the Nanjing Central Political Conference, the Propaganda Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Interior: It is believed that the late Premier established the political program with freedom of speech and freedom of the press to proclaim to the world. This time, the Central Government has revised the Publication Law, presumably adhering to this principle with reverence and diligence. However, since newspapers published the full text of the revised Publication Law, the journalistic community across the country has been alarmed, rushing to tell each other, claiming that the Northern Warlords in the past controlled public opinion with stringent measures, and comparing them, there seems to be a distinction. Recently, the news industry in Beijing and Shanghai has telegraphed for reconsideration and submitted petitions. Although the authorities have agreed to provide relief in the implementing regulations, it is found that the implementing regulations can only be a transitional form of the old law and a supplement to the present law. Under the principle of not conflicting with this law, it can be relied upon for remedy. If the revised Publication Law has many points that are difficult to implement, most of them are related to principles. It seems that it is not enough to request a redefinition of principles and reconsideration of the revision. It is feared that it will still be difficult to eliminate implementation obstacles. Moreover, the news industry in the inland areas is particularly fearful of the amendment made by the competent official to the county government. The recent incidents of Jingjiang and Tongshan sealing newspapers and arresting people are not far away. From now on, when writing records, there will always be a shadow of imprisonment swaying before us, and we will have to avoid changing a single word to avoid guilt. Moreover, advertisements and announcements have responsible parties, and the revised laws are subject to the same restrictions. Then, in the future, the business operations of newspapers will also be in fear of being punished. The association believes that the interests are closely related and cannot remain silent. It is working with colleagues in neighboring counties to draft a detailed presentation. In addition to submitting it separately, we first send a telegram to present it respectfully, hoping for your examination and understanding. Wuxi County Journalists' Association.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Education Circles of Wujin Come to the Provincial Capital to Petition</p>
<p>The decision made by the 764th Committee Meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government last week to reassign Qian Hao, Director of the Wujin County Education Bureau, and appoint Sun Youguang to fill the vacancy has been reported in various newspapers. The education circles of Wujin were extremely indignant upon hearing this news. They petitioned on the previous day (29th). Secretary Yan received them and representatives, including Zhuang Quan, presented a petition and stated the reasons for the petition, earnestly requesting the reassignment of capable individuals to maintain education in Wujin. Secretary Yan found the reasons presented to be quite legitimate and promised to forward the petition to Chairman Chen. The representatives considered the reply satisfactory and left. Subsequently, they petitioned the Education Department. Director Zhou was in Shanghai for official business and had not yet returned to the province. Secretary Chen received the representatives, who stated their intentions. Secretary Chen replied that he would convey the representatives' opinions after Director Zhou returned to the department. The petition representatives, including Zhuang Quan, expressed satisfaction and left. According to the representatives of the Wujin education circles, the purpose of this petition was entirely because the new director, Sun Youguang, could not set an example for the education circles with his daily conduct. The entire county's education circles were unwilling to remain silent and expressed that they would not stop until their goal was achieved. The petition is as follows: Regarding the matter of petitioning, it has recently been reported that at the 764th meeting of your government, Qian Hao, Director of the Wujin County Education Bureau, was reassigned, and Sun Youguang was appointed to fill the vacancy. Upon hearing this, colleagues in the education circles were extremely shocked. Since Director Qian took office last June, he has reformed the bureau's affairs and reorganized education, sparing no effort in planning. Moreover, the early drought caused disaster, the rural areas collapsed, and the scenery was in ruins. The source of education funding was exhausted, and the primary schools had no rice to cook, already in a state of virtual stagnation. However, Director Qian, amidst hardship and distress, did not shy away from labor and complaints, making every effort to raise funds and distribute them monthly. His benefits to education are truly not insignificant. Recently, he handled private school advancement and displayed great ambitions. Unexpectedly, out of the blue, it was decided to reassign Director Qian and appoint Sun Youguang to fill the vacancy. Regarding the retention of Director Qian, the province and department naturally have the power, but Sun Youguang's selected conduct is vile, running to powerful figures, speculating in the revolution, and engaging in partisan strife, causing local disputes for years. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, the former provincial party department Minister Ni Bilai came to Changzhou to investigate the case. Sun knelt down in public to beg for forgiveness for failing to coerce. His personal corruption is extreme. Since then, he has been disdained by local people. Moreover, when Sun Youguang served as the county school supervisor in this county last year, he only inspected more than twenty schools in the first year of his term. In the half year of his successor, he did not inspect a single school. The Education Department has recorded two demerits. Knowing that he was uneasy in his position, he submitted his resignation. The records are all there and can be verified. Sun Youguang currently serves as an executive committee member of the county party department, concurrently as the director of the Dayou Seed Breeding Farm, and the manager of the Wuyi Road Automobile Company. With multiple positions and selfish motives, if he is appointed as the Director of the Education Bureau, he will inevitably repeat the same mistakes. Colleagues, learning from the past, for the sake of maintaining education in Wujin and considering the department's assessment, dare not avoid punishment and brave the summer heat to petition in the province, earnestly requesting your government to review the situation, swiftly propose a review, and reappoint capable individuals to maintain education and quell disputes, which is for the public good. Respectfully presented to Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government and Director Zhou of the Education Department.</p>

<p>Xiaoshan: Three Families Robbed by Bandits in Pengshan One Night</p>
<p>Ni Xiaoyuan, a resident of Pengshan, near Linpu in the southern countryside of Xiaoshan, is a farmer. His family is reasonably well-off. His elder brother, Shi Lü, is a businessman in Shanghai. His family is also relatively prosperous. Recently, his eldest daughter returned home to spend the summer, bringing many suitcases with her, which attracted the attention of bandits. The previous night (28th), more than a dozen bandits armed with shotguns and flashlights, their faces painted black, broke into the house by digging through the wall. They then went upstairs and into the rooms, ransacking boxes and chests, and carrying out a major robbery. At that time, the family members were all tied up and did not dare to speak out. Fortunately, the neighbors heard the noise and sounded an alarm, and the bandits did not dare to stay long and left with a howl. As a result, three families were robbed, with losses exceeding 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Good Cotton Harvest Expected in Dongxiang</h3>
<p>Dongxiang, Xiaoshan, has always grown cotton. This year, the weather has been sunny and clear, and rain has been frequent, so the cotton harvest is very good. Most of the cotton plants are now forming bolls, and new cotton will be seen after the beginning of autumn. After last year's drought and famine, when there was no harvest at all, the general farmers are now overjoyed and singing songs of harvest and prosperous years.</p>

<h3>Journalists' Association Telegraphed Central Political Conference Yesterday to Request Reconsideration of Revised Publication Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists' Association, believing that the revised Publication Law passed by the Legislative Yuan is difficult to implement, brought it up for discussion at the fifth standing committee meeting the day before yesterday. It was resolved to telegraph the Central Political Conference, requesting the Legislative Yuan to reconsider it. The original text of the telegram is as follows: To the Nanjing Central Political Conference: It is believed that the recently passed revised Publication Law by the Legislative Yuan is too restrictive on the news industry. Once implemented, it will inevitably cause many obstacles. The Shanghai Daily Association and the Nanjing Journalism Society have listed the various points and submitted petitions. We sincerely invite you to examine it carefully, hoping that you will comply with the situation and re-examine it and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. This would be most fortunate. Shanghai Journalists' Association.</p>

<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, in order to reorganize Sichuan's finances and reduce the burden on the people, the Ministry of Finance has designated the province as a unified tax area and will open a unified tax office, scheduled to take effect today. The original text of the Ministry of Finance's instruction to each district's unified tax bureau is recorded as follows: Regarding the case of preparing to open a unified tax office in Sichuan Province, the Ministry has previously telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government and telegraphed the Sichuan Financial Commissioner to negotiate with the Provincial Government nearby to prepare.

From that date, all goods entering the country that have been subject to the unified tax will be exempted from local tax. The goods within Sichuan Province that are subject to the unified tax will be handed over to the organs appointed by the Ministry of Finance to collect the unified tax from that date. It is found that the Sichuan Provincial Government has requested the Ministry to set a date for the implementation of the unified tax in Sichuan Province. The province should be designated as a unified tax area immediately, and the unified tax office should be opened on August 1st of this year.

There should be no further double taxation upon arrival in the province. For unified tax goods such as cotton yarn and its woven products, matches, cement, wheat flour, beer, foreign wine, and fire wine, which were previously subject to the unified tax when transported to the province, if there is evidence of double taxation after being delivered to Sichuan Province, the Ministry will be requested to refund the tax. Now that the unified tax office has been opened in Sichuan Province, the double taxation should be stopped to comply with the tax policy. For various unified tax goods manufactured in factories within Sichuan Province, the Sichuan Financial Commissioner should send personnel to the factory to audit and collect the unified tax in accordance with the regulations before they are allowed to be sold. In addition to the distribution, the bureau chief and director are ordered to comply immediately and order all subordinates to comply. This order.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to Inspect Imported Livestock Starting Today; Imported Cattle and Sheep Must Pass Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's livestock inspection has previously only covered exported livestock products, not imported livestock. Following an order from the Ministry of Industry, stating that diseases previously unseen in our country's livestock have recently been introduced from abroad, spreading inland and causing significant harm, measures should be prepared to inspect livestock imports as soon as possible to prevent these diseases. The bureau decided to start with imported cattle and sheep, and drafted detailed implementation rules and supplementary measures, which were submitted to the Ministry of Industry and then to the Executive Yuan for approval. The ministry issued a decree for promulgation. Subsequently, to conduct this inspection, the assistance of the Customs was required, and consultations took some time. It is now reported that the bureau has agreed with the Jianghai Customs Superintendent on provisional measures for livestock import inspection, effective August 1st (i.e., today).

<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway's Gongchen Bridge branch line passenger train, since it was changed to stop at the Gongchen Bridge Station's Dengyun Bridge freight platform, has had its timetable slightly altered due to the lack of a turning line facility at the platform, which made shunting time-consuming.

<h3>Grain Exchange Resumes Auctions of Japanese Wheat Today</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the case of the Grain Exchange resuming auctions of Japanese wheat has been decided by the exchange's board of directors to start from August 1st. A reporter learned the details from the exchange as follows:</p>
<p>Previously Suspended Auctions.  Japan originally did not produce wheat. The so-called "Japanese wheat" is wheat that Japanese merchants transship to China for sale from wheat-producing countries. Previously, due to various reasons, the Grain Exchange decided to stop trading in wheat shipped to China by Japanese merchants or Japanese ships. Factories in our country used to order foreign wheat directly from wheat-producing countries.</p>
<p>Resumes Today.  Recently, relations between China and Japan have improved, and the Yarn and Cloth Exchange first accepted the circulation of Japanese yarn on the market. The Grain Exchange is also resuming trade with Japanese merchants. It has been found that Japanese merchants ship foreign wheat to China from wheat-producing countries at lower freight costs, so the prices are also cheaper. From August 1st, foreign wheat transported by Japanese merchants will be officially auctioned on the market.</p>
<h3>China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association Hosts Tobacco Dealers from the Entire City Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association has been working quite intensively recently. Yesterday afternoon, it hosted tobacco dealers from the entire city at the Central Western Restaurant on Fourth Avenue, with over a hundred attendees, including Shen Qixiang, Jie Chengxian, Shen Dehua, and Chen Fuqi. Members of the association, Lao Dixiu and others, were in charge of the reception. The chairman of the association, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Liangyu, and Shen Weiting, delivered speeches. Teng Zhixiang, a representative of the tobacco dealers, expressed his opinions. Shen Weiting then spoke on behalf of the tobacco dealers, followed by individual talks by tobacco dealers present. They unanimously expressed their determination to rise up in cooperation and maintain national goods cigarettes. Tea and snacks were served, and the meeting adjourned. The speeches are listed below: (1) Member Yuan Ludeng stated, "I am deeply grateful that everyone has come despite the heat. The highest goal of our association is to maintain and then develop the city. The development of national cigarettes is also in the interest of tobacco dealers. Our association and the tobacco dealers are as dependent as arms and teeth. In these difficult times, our association deeply expects the tobacco dealers to make efforts to support us, and not just to go through the motions." (2) Member Chen Liangyu stated, "The gradual decline of Chinese cigarette factories is due to many reasons, and the encroachment of privately-made hand-rolled cigarettes on the market is one of them. I dare to hope that manufacturers will petition the tax bureau to strictly ban them, so that tobacco dealers can devote their full efforts to the sales of Chinese cigarette factories. Now, various industries related to national goods cigarettes, such as cigarette factories, tobacco leaves, and color printing, have organized maintenance associations, which can pool their wisdom and efforts. Tobacco dealers should not be an exception and should contribute their modest efforts, while also seeking to benefit themselves and others." (3) Member Shen Weiting stated, "Today, tobacco dealers have gathered together, with some coming from afar. Seeing this good sign, it is worthy of celebration for the future of our national goods cigarettes. Our association plans to conduct a large-scale publicity campaign to awaken the determination of compatriots across the country to smoke national goods cigarettes. I deeply hope that all tobacco dealers will assist in our association's publicity work and devote their full efforts to promoting national cigarettes, so that Chinese cigarette factories can have a chance to survive. I now ask everyone present to express their views, and all tobacco dealers are always willing to provide guidance to our association's work, so as to achieve speedy and great results. I cannot but hope for this." (4) Guest Teng Zhixiang inquired, "The Maintenance Association is hosting us tobacco dealers today, with high expectations for our industry to cooperate in promoting national goods cigarettes. It is believed that difficult times build a nation. Today, the national cigarette industry is also in a difficult situation. People are thinking of striving, so there is the organization of the Maintenance Association. If practical work is implemented, the difficult situation can be overcome. In my humble opinion, to seek the prosperity of national goods cigarettes, one is to research and refine the quality of the product itself, and the other is to resist and ban privately-made hand-rolled cigarettes. If the tobacco leaf industry can refuse to trade with them, and the tax bureau can severely punish them, the scourge of private cigarettes can be eliminated. As for the Maintenance Association's wish for our industry to assist in publicity, if there are practical measures, our industry will be happy to devote our efforts to running errands." (5) Representative Shen stated on behalf of the tobacco dealers, "Now, I, representing the tobacco dealers, have something to present. The tobacco dealers are happy to promote national goods cigarettes. Even small shop clerks have the same feeling. It is believed that everyone will share in the glory of seeing national goods come to light. The current business of tobacco dealers is also in a state of decline. Although the market is sluggish, the encroachment of tax-free private cigarettes on the legitimate retail business of tobacco dealers is one of the reasons. In summary, cigarettes and tobacco dealers are like arms and hands. If the two sides can exchange opinions at any time and jointly plan the development of the business, it will be twice the result with half the effort, and everyone will benefit. Just as the Maintenance Association needs our tobacco dealers to assist in its work, our tobacco dealers will also strive to move towards it."</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Sells Guangji Steamship for Scrap; Purchased by Hualun Foreign Firm; Sale Price 9,500 Yuan</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Wenzhou liner Guangji, due to its old age, was opposed by various public groups in Yongjia last year after the electricity department protested its navigation. The bureau was ordered by the Ministry to stop its northern sailings and was left idle in the Huangpu River for a year. The bureau has repeatedly tendered it for sale, but the bid prices were too low and did not meet the limit, so it was unsuccessful. Now the bureau has changed its approach and is selling the Guangji for scrap. The purchase is restricted, and it is not allowed to be repaired and sailed on any route. It can only be dismantled and sold for steel and machinery, distributed and sold separately, or converted into a hulk. The sale price has been reduced to the lowest amount. Now it has been purchased by Hualun Foreign Firm for 9,500 yuan, and the payment has been made. The bureau sent a letter to the firm yesterday, asking them to send someone to take over the ship. However, all other expenses will be borne by the firm. It has been found that although the Guangji is old, the quality of the hull is excellent and it is the oldest and most historical ocean-going vessel of the bureau.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Red Swastika Society Raises Funds to Help with Rice Crust Porridge and Fried Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Nanjing Red Swastika Society Raises Funds to Help with Rice Crust Porridge and Fried Indica Rice for Flood Relief: This year's floods are severe, and emergency relief is most important. However, for emergency relief, how can it be effective and how can it save lives? There must be in-depth research. The Swastika Society has handled floods for many years, and based on its experience, the most important thing is to go deep into the flooded areas at the time of the flooding, hire boats to rescue refugees, and distribute dry food and medicine. The most effective dry food for emergency relief and saving lives is rice crust porridge or fried indica rice. This is because the disaster victims are in the water, and they can chew on this rice crust porridge or fried rice at any time. Not only can it save lives, but it can also prevent epidemics. Because rice crust porridge and fried rice have a fragrant and dry taste and help with moisture and water, they are sufficient to treat diseases. Now, we loudly appeal to the public, hoping that all rice-eating areas in the north and south of the Yangtze River, provinces, counties, cities, and villages, will show great compassion and donate some rice crust porridge or fried indica rice, and hand them over to the Red Swastika Society in various places, or local organizations, to collect them, pack them into sacks, and transfer them to this society at any time for distribution in the disaster areas. In a very short time, millions of catties of dry food can be accumulated, saving the lives of millions of disaster victims. This kind of merit is easy to do, so why not do it? It is more beneficial than subsequent general relief. If you are willing to donate, please send it to our society at Xiaohuowa Lane in Nanjing for acceptance. Receipts will be issued according to the weight in catties to show trustworthiness. We bow our heads nine times to the disaster victims and ask for your consideration. Sincerely, the Nanjing Red Swastika Society.</p>
<h3>Sailing Vessels Operating To and From The Huangpu River Form A Joint Small Tugboat Company; Offices Set Up In Wusong</h3>
<p>This city is a major port for domestic and foreign trade, with numerous factories and increasingly frequent freight traffic.

<h3>Suffering Due to Public Service: Wang Bin'yan Bankrupt, Forced to Sell Home to Repay Debt; Third Trial Concludes with August 10th Auction of Residence</h3>
<p>Wang Bin'yan, the head of the Zhabei Defense Corps, is known throughout Zhabei for his enthusiasm for public welfare and defense of the area. During the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War in the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), Zhabei suddenly saw an influx of over 40,000 soldiers and 20,000 refugees. The people were panicked and order was disrupted. Fortunately, the then-Governor of Jiangsu Province and Superintendent of Military Rehabilitation, Han Guojun, repeatedly telegraphed Wang to take responsibility for maintaining local supplies and military provisions to prevent local devastation. Wang, in the name of the Zhabei Charity Association, sought to borrow money, totaling 228,649.70 yuan in advances. He submitted a register, and the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, Zeng Pu, came to Shanghai to sign a contract. It was reported to the Ministry of the Army for record-keeping, with all the land of the state-owned Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau as collateral. Among these advances, the title deeds to Wang's private residence in Zhabei on Mei Road, Tongde Lane, and nine mu (approximately 1.5 acres) of land were mortgaged to the Guangdong Bank, the Hong Kong National Bank, and the Cunde Money Exchange for 30,000 taels of silver. Over the past ten years, the principal and interest have not been repaid, with a total debt exceeding 84,000 yuan. Repeated demands for payment from Wang have been unsuccessful, leading to a lawsuit in court, which has now been judged in a third trial, ordering full repayment. However, Wang, who has served as the head of the Zhabei Charity Association and the head of the Defense Corps, is known for his integrity and has no savings. Previously, the Hong Kong National Bank auctioned Wang's house on Hua Mu Land to settle the debt. Now, due to the Guangdong Bank's lawsuit and the third trial verdict, the Shanghai Local Court of Jiangsu Province has issued a summons for execution at 8:00 AM yesterday. Although Wang hired lawyers Wang Liangqing and Zhu Chengxun to request a temporary postponement of execution, it was denied, with a deadline of August 10th to auction Wang's residence to repay the mortgage debt. Recently, prominent figures such as Lin Kanghou, Fang Jiaobo, Chen Bingkun, Lu Bohong, Shen Lianfang, and Xu Qianlin, as well as Shen Huachen representing the Silk Industry Association, She Xipin representing the Timber Industry Association, Qiang Zisheng representing the Rice Milling Industry Association, and Fu Qiangeng representing the Bean and Rice Industry Association, have witnessed Wang's entire family facing bankruptcy due to public service. They have repeatedly requested the Local Association and Minister Kong to provide swift assistance. The Chairman of the Local Association, Du Yuesheng, as well as Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, and Zhou, are making every effort to help, and have personally requested Minister Kong for relief. It is also reported that the Cunde Money Exchange at 316 Ningbo Road has also hired lawyer Wang Youling to sue Wang in the Local Court, with a hearing scheduled for August 10th.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Rent Reduction Dispute in Hengmao Lane; Both Parties Sign Rent Reduction Agreement</h3>

(2) For the two months of rent reduction from October to December of this year, the landlord will still collect the original amount due to other considerations. The tenants will deduct the amount of the two months' rent reduction when paying the rent in November 1936. (3) The landlord shall not sublet individual rooms in either the double-unit or single-unit houses in the lane. (4) This committee will, to the extent possible, dispatch personnel to assist in the collection of rent arrears owed by the tenants in the lane.

<h3>Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor Zhu Shuping Found Not Guilty; Sun Hu's Family Also Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Zhu Shuping, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor residing at No. 57 Changsha Road, prescribed medicine containing Ephedra and Aconite for the two-year-old child of the woman Sun Hu, who was suffering from lingering symptoms after being treated for measles. Unexpectedly, after taking the medicine, the child's condition deteriorated and death could not be averted. Sun Hu blamed Zhu, accusing him of negligence in his practice, and filed a criminal lawsuit against Zhu. However, Zhu argued that his treatment was proper and denied any negligence, and accused Sun Hu of false accusation and defamation, and filed a counterclaim against her.</p>
<p>Under the jurisdiction of the Special District Local Court, with both parties holding to their own claims and the question of whether Dr. Zhu was negligent only being determinable by those with specialized knowledge, it was agreed by both parties that the prescription written by Zhu would be sent to the National Medical Association for evaluation. The association replied to the court that the prescription was not improper. The presiding judge Liu summoned both parties for questioning, and yesterday afternoon announced the verdict: Zhu Shuping was not guilty, and Sun Hu's family was also not guilty.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Repatriating Unemployed Hunanese</h3>
<p>Due to the poor economic situation, the number of unemployed people is increasing daily. Since the Dragon Boat Festival, over 500 unemployed people from Hunan have been living in Shanghai without any means of support. They have gone to the Hunanese Association in Shanghai to request relief and assistance in returning to their hometowns. The association has specially dispatched Zhou Zhenlin to negotiate with the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting them to provide preferential treatment as with the repatriation of refugees. It is proposed to charter a special ship starting today to transport all these unemployed Hunanese back to Changsha within half a month. The company stated that according to the regulations issued by the ministry for the repatriation of refugees, official documents must be provided by the competent authorities, such as the Relief Committee, the Provincial Government, the Municipal Government, or the Public Security Bureau, before the company can proceed accordingly. The relevant regulations have now been sent to the Hunanese Association, asking them to follow the procedures. As soon as notification is received from the competent authorities, a ship will be dispatched for repatriation.</p>
<h3>Suicide Attempt Due to Poverty; Rescued and Given a New Chance</h3>
<p>Yan Huaiqing, a 42-year-old from Jiaxing, used to work as a female laborer in a cotton mill in Nantong. Recently, due to crop failures and famine, she borrowed over ten yuan last month and came to Shanghai to look for her younger brother but was unsuccessful. Recently, her wallet was stolen by a pickpocket, leaving her penniless. Yesterday morning, she walked to Zhuanqiao Town, where, overwhelmed by resentment and hunger, she conceived the idea of ending her life. She hanged herself from a tree by the roadside. Later, a villager spotted her and managed to rescue her, giving her a new chance. She was immediately taken to the local police station, and the police chief arranged to purchase a train ticket to send her back to her hometown in Jiaxing to prevent her from becoming destitute in another place.</p>
<h3>Inmates of the Second Special District Did Not Request Improved Meals</h3>
<p>On the 28th of last month, this newspaper reported that inmates from the printing room, miscellaneous affairs room, main prison, and political prisoners in the Second Special District Prison on Route Massenet in the French Concession requested improved meals on the 24th. Upon investigation, this was found to be untrue, and may have been a rumor.</p>
<h3>Double Suicide Attempt at the Great China Hotel; Truth Awaits Investigation</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a male guest checked into the Great China Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Xizang Road. The hotel accountant led him to Room 431, where he stayed. The guest was wearing a white silk long gown and short shirt and pants, and identified himself as Zhang Mingfu, 22 years old, from Songjiang. He did not go out during the day and seemed relaxed. Until around 9:00 PM that night, a woman, claiming to be Ms. Zhang, 21 years old, from Songjiang, went to Room 431 to meet with Zhang Mingfu. They were very intimate. Shortly after, they closed the door and went to bed, with nothing else unusual happening. Until around 12:00 PM yesterday, a tea boy on the floor, seeing that they had not gotten up, went to knock on the door. He received no response for a long time, which aroused his suspicion. He managed to open the door and found the man and woman lying on the bed, both pale and unconscious. Remnants of poison were found beside the pillows, indicating that they had taken poison. He immediately reported to the police station, and the two were rushed to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the poisoning, they were unable to speak even late into the evening. Therefore, the truth remains to be investigated.</p>
<h3>Fire on Foreign Ship in Huangpu River; Firefighters Injured</h3>
<p>A foreign ship, with only the Western letters "Darents" visible, was berthed in the Huangpu River at the Lanzhou Road Wharf in Yangshupu. At 7:45 PM last night, a fire broke out in the coal bunker of the ship, and thick smoke and flames erupted immediately. The Yangshupu Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire. However, one firefighter, No. 553, was injured by the fire while bravely fighting the blaze, suffering severe burns to his head, back, and arms. He was taken to the hospital for treatment by his colleagues.</p>
<h3>Woman Drowns After Falling into River</h3>
<p>Ms. Xu Xue, a woman from Haimen residing at the Xu Xuefa teahouse at the Xiaomu Bridge on Longhua Road, and her younger sister, Zhang Xiuying (30 years old), were carrying coal ash on a coal boat in the Caohujing River in Longhua at 1:30 PM yesterday. For some reason, Zhang Xiuying suddenly jumped into the river and committed suicide. Due to the strong current, rescue was impossible, and she drowned. Xu Xue reported the incident to the local police station. It was reported that Zhang Xiuying had been suffering from mental illness for over two months. Inspector Liu Songjian, upon receiving the report, ordered the local ward head, Zhang Liqing, to report the incident to the hospital for an autopsy. In the afternoon, the hospital dispatched prosecutor Li Fen and an examiner to the scene to conduct the autopsy. It was determined that the deceased was female and had died by drowning. The autopsy report was completed, and the body was handed over to Xu Xue for burial.</p>

<h3>Robbers Simultaneously Loot Three Businesses at the Intersection of Yangshupu Road and Linqing Road; Divided into Two Groups, Robbing in Different Directions, Then Converging to Continue the Robbery; Police Apprehend Three Robbers After Strict Pursuit</h3>
<p>At approximately 8:35 PM last night, a robbery occurred at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Linqing Road. The robbers were incredibly audacious, continuously robbing as many as three businesses. According to eyewitnesses, there were a total of eight robbers, six of whom were wearing black Guangdong silk shirts and pants, each carrying a handgun. The other two were wearing blue cloth shirts and pants and were unarmed. They spoke in various local, Shandong, and Jiangbei accents. All were of short stature. During the robbery, the robbers split into two groups. Four robbers robbed the Dachang Woolen Shop at No. 2061 Yangshupu Road. The robbers wearing blue cloth shirts and pants jumped over the counter and into the shop, snatching all the silver dollars and several hundred small coins from the cash register and fleeing. When one of the shop employees saw this and tried to run out to call for help, he was spotted by a lookout, who fired a shot into the air to scare him back. At the same time, the other four robbers had already broken into the Yuantai Chang Southern Goods Shop at No. 2057 Yangshupu Road. The shop was in the process of distributing salaries to the employees, so all the cash and banknotes, totaling about 300 yuan, were taken. The robbers quickly retreated and rejoined the robbers who had looted the Dachang Shop, and headed to the Hudong Shoe Shop at No. 15 Linqing Road, where they robbed again. However, the shoe shop did not have much money, so only 25 yuan in banknotes was stolen. Still not satisfied, the robbers smashed the display window and snatched two bolts of Guangdong silk and four pairs of slippers before shouting and fleeing north towards the Xiangyin Road area. By the time the patrolling police arrived, the robbers had long since fled. The three shops then checked their losses and reported the robbery to the local police station, requesting an investigation. It was learned that when the robbers were carrying out the robbery, the area had not yet closed for the day, and many residents and shop employees had witnessed the event. Some had followed the robbers secretly, intending to investigate their actions, but the robbers showed no concern. Their audacity was unparalleled. When the robbers retreated from the Hudong Lujiazhuang area, the crowds watching the robbers were unable to avoid each other, causing a girl to be knocked to the ground and break her nose. She has now been sent to the hospital for treatment. The fact that people, knowing it was a robbery, did not attempt to capture the robbers but instead followed them as if watching a strange and exciting event is truly incomprehensible. As of the time of this writing, it has been learned that the local police station has apprehended three robbers and is currently interrogating them.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Creditors of China Industrial Bank; Creditors Refuse to Vote; Creditors Oppose, Meeting Adjourns Without Results; Xu Yongzuo Announces Assets, Liabilities</h3>
<p>Since the China Industrial Bank went bankrupt on October 11th of last year, a lawsuit has been filed in the First Special District Local Court. The court appointed accountants Xu Yongzuo, Li Ding, and lawyer Qian Shusheng to conduct liquidation. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, a meeting of creditors was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Because the creditors unanimously opposed the settlement plan proposed by Lu Xihou, the meeting adjourned without results. The details obtained by the China News Agency reporter are as follows:</p>
<p>Creditors Present: Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, a meeting of creditors of the China Industrial Bank was held to solicit the creditors' agreement to the settlement plan proposed by Lu Xihou. A total of 1,214 creditor representatives, including Xiang Xun, Luo Jiaheng, Tang Mingshi, Yu Zhongluo, Dong Yu, Wang Shuxun, Hu Yaocheng, and Zheng Zhaoding, attended, representing claims totaling 382,745.89 yuan. The debtor Lu Xihou was represented by lawyer Lu Ruizheng. The chairman group consisted of Li Jiashan, a clerk dispatched by the First Special District Court, and liquidators Xu Yongzuo, accountant Li Ding, and lawyer Qian Shusheng. Zhang Shourang served as the recorder.</p>
<p>Meeting Order: The order of the meeting was as follows: (1) Ringing the bell to open the meeting; (2) Reporting the number of attendees and the amount of debt; (3) Reporting the progress of the liquidation; (4) Reporting the asset and liability situation; (5) Electing supervisors; (6) Deciding on the settlement plan; (7) Other proposals; (8) Adjourning the meeting. However, when the chairman group took the stage to report, most of the creditors had already expressed their opposition, and discussions arose. The meeting became chaotic, and people began to shout. Li Ding reported on the meaning of the meeting, and Li Jiashan, a clerk from the court, explained that if the creditors opposed the settlement plan proposed by Lu Xihou, they could cast a negative vote. If they agreed, they could cast a positive vote. They were urged to calm down.</p>
<p>Refusal to Vote: During the meeting, creditor lawyers Yu Zhongluo, Tang Mingshi, and others raised questions to the chairman group, which can be divided into three points: (1) Is this liquidation truly a liquidation of the China Industrial Bank, or is it a liquidation of Lu Xihou and Lu Mengxiang, two people related to the China Industrial Bank? (2) The China Industrial Bank was established in 1923, with an authorized capital of 20 million yuan and a paid-up capital of over 2.5 million yuan. How was this 2.5 million yuan of capital used? (3) The shareholders, directors, and supervisors of the China Industrial Bank include many reputable or wealthy individuals, and they should all be responsible for repayment. Before the lawyers finished speaking, some creditors proposed to refuse to vote, and they all left one after another. The meeting adjourned without any results.</p>
<p>Total Liabilities: The China News Agency reporter went to the accounting firm of liquidator Xu Yongzuo to investigate the total liabilities of the bank. The Nanjing Road Head Office had 741,172.32 yuan, the Nanshi Branch had 106,872.81 yuan, the Tianzhutang Street Branch had 97,190.89 yuan, the Foch Road Branch had 148,411.33 yuan, the Songjiang Branch had 51,796.43 yuan, the Suzhou Branch had 122,309.75 yuan, and the Dongshan Branch had 25,446.20 yuan, totaling 1,293,769.74 yuan. After deducting outstanding payments, the actual liabilities were 812,981.90 yuan.</p>
<p>Total Assets: The estimated total assets were 694,760.47 yuan for the Nanjing Road Head Office, 61,727.70 yuan for the Nanshi Branch, 22,228.09 yuan for the Tianzhutang Street Branch, 6,676.03 yuan for the Foch Road Branch, 15,043.37 yuan for the Songjiang Branch, and 4,993.37 yuan for the Dongshan Branch, totaling 850,506.91 yuan. After deducting the amount of collateralized deposits and bad debts, the actual assets were only 193,199.38 yuan, which was far short. According to Xu Yongzuo, the creditors present did not reach the legally required three-quarters. He will have to consult with the court tonight.</p>
<h3>Worsening Problem of French Concession Rickshaw Puller Registration; Rickshaw Pullers to Petition Today; Rickshaw Owners Unanimously Oppose</h3>
<p>The issue of the French Concession periodically registering rickshaw pullers has been met with opposition from both rickshaw owners and pullers since the news came out. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have mediated, but to no avail. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. Rickshaw puller representatives launched a major petition yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>French Municipal Council: The registration of rickshaw pullers has been underway for a month, but rickshaw owners and pullers, considering their vital interests, have resolutely opposed it. To date, no one has registered at the registration office. The police department of the French Municipal Council plans to ban unregistered rickshaws from operating starting August 1st (today) and requested the assistance of the municipal government the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Petition: After the French authorities decided to ban unregistered rickshaws from operating starting today, rickshaw owners and pullers were extremely panicked, fearing that their livelihoods would be cut off. Rickshaw puller representatives, including Shi Changsheng, led over 40 representatives to the Nanshi Rickshaw Trade Association at No. 34 Sanmin Lane, Caoyudong Road, to petition, stating that the rickshaw pullers unanimously opposed registration. The association representatives promised to relay the message to the rickshaw owners. It is reported that a large-scale petition will be held again today.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owner Meeting: The rickshaw owners, sympathizing with the demands of the rickshaw pullers, oppose registration. It is reported that the French police department will ban unregistered rickshaws from operating starting today, and the rickshaw owners, considering the importance of the matter, have decided to hold a meeting today to discuss how to respond.</p>
<p>Representative's Remarks: Yesterday, a spokesperson for the rickshaw owners stated, "The relationship between the rickshaw owners and the concession authorities is limited to paying taxes and operating. Regarding the rickshaw puller registration issue, the main stakeholders are the rickshaw pullers. Whether to register or not is up to the rickshaw pullers to decide, and the rickshaw owners have no need to make any claims. However, the relationship between the rickshaw owners and the rickshaw pullers is close, like lips and teeth. Most of the rickshaw pullers in Nanshi are ignorant and lack social experience. Not only do they not understand the true meaning of registration, but they also spread various unfavorable rumors. Previously, when registration was rumored, the rickshaw pullers fled back to their hometowns, as if a major disaster was about to happen. This caused a great blow to the rickshaw owners' business. Later, the situation calmed down slightly after the rickshaw owners provided firm guarantees that there would be no registration. Now that registration is actually being implemented, the rickshaw pullers will flee again, and the rickshaw owners' business will be hit hard first. To protect their own business, the rickshaw owners sympathize with the rickshaw pullers and oppose registration. As for the French Municipal Council, they previously allowed the rickshaw owners: (1) to register freely without time limit; (2) to hold registration procedures in batches. (All to be publicly announced by the French authorities in the newspaper.) Unexpectedly, the ink was not yet dry, and the French authorities broke their promise. Starting from August 1st, they immediately banned unregistered rickshaws and forced all rickshaws in the French Concession, whether they should register or not, to register, with all sorts of threats. This situation is regrettable. If the French authorities take drastic measures against the rickshaw pullers starting today, and provoke an unexpected incident, who will be responsible? Anyone with clear eyes can see it at a glance. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life will rise up and provide assistance so that the livelihoods of tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers can be preserved, which would be a great blessing for society."</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang Arrives in Shanghai on the Morning of the Third; Sailed on the Conte Verde, Passing Hong Kong on the First; Expected to Arrive at the China Merchants North Wharf at 8:00 AM on the Third</h3>
<p>——Grand Welcome Reception to Be Held at Shanghai World College on the Fourth</p>
<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang, having accepted an invitation from Soviet Russia this spring to perform Chinese symbolic drama arts, was warmly welcomed by the people there. After the performances, Mr. Mei, accompanied by Dr. Yu Shangyuan, detoured through various Central European countries to study dramatic arts. At the beginning of last month, they embarked on the Conte Verde from Italy to return to China. According to reliable sources, the ship is expected to arrive in Hong Kong at 7:00 AM today (the first), where it will dock for three or four hours before setting sail for Shanghai. Sir Robert Ho Tung originally intended to hold a grand welcome reception after the ship's arrival, but after consulting with the company, it was stated that due to the tide in Shanghai, the ship must set sail from Hong Kong at 11:00 AM sharp, and could not stay in Hong Kong for long. The company expressed its deep apologies, and therefore the welcome reception could not be held due to time constraints. It was decided to hold a small gathering at the Hong Kong Hotel at 9:00 AM on the second, with simpler arrangements and fewer people, in order to have a good meeting. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the morning of the third, and will dock directly at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf. On the way back, the ship passed through Singapore, Penang, and other places. Since the local consuls were all old acquaintances, they were very pleased with Mr. Mei's triumphant return, and specially coordinated with the local Chinese communities to hold warm welcomes. All arrangements were made in advance via wireless telegraph to the ship, and the receptions along the way were very busy.

<h3>A Gambler Turns Out to Be a Prisoner: Beautiful Women in Front of Him, Wine to Pay Respects, Pretending to Be a Big Shot, Issuing Bad Checks, Fraud and Breach of Trust, Meeting in Court</h3>
<p>Xie Wenyun, a 24-year-old native of Nanjing, works as a messenger at the Jian Da Silver Store in Ruyi Lane, Henan Road. He usually likes to frequent brothels and is familiar with the prostitute Liu Di, a former popular prostitute (Kresler), at No. 22 Huile Lane, Yunnan Road. They sing and drink together almost every night. On June 20th of this year, Xie invited many friends to have a banquet at Liu Di's brothel. Although Xie is a messenger at a silver store, his monthly income is limited, so how can he indulge in wine and women and spend money arbitrarily? However, with beautiful women in front of him, he cannot help but pretend to be a big shot. At that time, although Xie did not have cash on hand, he issued two Jian Da Silver Store promissory notes, one due on July 5th, for 100 yuan, and one due on July 10th, for 150 yuan, to Liu Di. The issuer of the notes was Xiang Kang Hao, and it was stated that Xiang Kang Hao was located at No. 17 Yong'an Street in the French Concession. On June 29th, Xie went to Liu Di's place again to drink and pay respects, and gave her another Jian Da Silver Store promissory note due on July 20th, for 80 yuan. However, Xie knew at the time that the three notes he had issued could not be cashed, and the first note was about to expire soon, so he used a perfunctory method and asked Liu Di's brothel to collect the second note on July 10th at the same time as the first note. At that time, the brothel did not know Xie's bottom line, so they agreed. When the time came, Shen Qiao, the manager of the brothel, instructed someone to take the note to the Jian Da Silver Store to find Xie, but he was not there. By July 13th, the Jian Da Silver Store had changed its name to Jin He Silver Store, and the manager had also been replaced by Guo Yun Gong. Because they did not see Xie, they could not negotiate. It was not until the 16th that they met Xie. After negotiations, Guo Yun Gong paid 40 yuan on behalf of Xie, and the remaining amount was to be paid later. Unexpectedly, Jin He Silver Store suddenly closed down a few days later, and Xie Wenyun also avoided meeting. Until the afternoon of the day before yesterday, when Xie was passing by Fuzhou Road, he was spotted by Bai Sheng, a rickshaw driver from Liu Di's brothel, who reported him to Chinese Constable No. 2359 and detective Xia Shikuai, who arrested Xie and detained him in the Zhabei Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed charges of fraud and breach of trust under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and presented the above situation, requesting legal action. According to Shen Qiao, the manager of Liu Di's brothel, the defendant had twice held banquets there and issued checks, but when they went to collect the money, they could not find it. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was vague. Judge Ye Shengchao verified the testimony and sentenced Xie Wenyun to one year and six months in prison for forging valuable documents.</p>
<h3>Local Court: A Strange Woman Arrived Yesterday, Speaking English and Dressing Strangely, Seeming to Have a Mental Illness</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 AM yesterday, a strange woman wearing unusual clothes, about 20 years old, with disheveled hair, wearing a short, bare-armed shirt and blue-striped trousers, and wooden clogs, suddenly broke into the local court. She was stopped by the gatekeeper, who asked her why she was there. The woman spoke in English, saying that she had been wronged and had come to appeal. Wang Rusong, a translator at the court, questioned her. She claimed to be a national of a certain country, and her father's name was Wang, who lived in Hepingfang, Zhabei. Her father had embezzled a large sum of money from her and driven her out, so she had nowhere to go. She had reported it to the water police station, and the police had told her to come here to appeal. When Mr. Wang asked her what nationality she was and how old she was, the woman stared blankly and did not answer, and her words were incoherent, seeming to have a mental illness. Mr. Wang told her that if she really had been wronged, the court had no jurisdiction and she should submit an appeal to her country's consulate. The strange woman thanked him and left.</p>
<h3>Counterfeiting Whiskey: Four Bottles of Counterfeit Liquor Mixed into Each Dozen; Those Involved Sentenced or Fined</h3>
<p>Lu Su Kui, Chief Chinese Inspector of the General Police Station, Detectives Feng Zhiming, Liu Shaokui, and Chen Yonggui, Detective's Assistant, etc., previously discovered that someone was secretly organizing the counterfeiting of "whiskey" for sale in the city. The method of manufacturing was to first collect hundreds of empty whiskey bottles, and then spend money to buy genuine whiskey, which was mixed with Chinese whiskey. Because according to market prices, each bottle of whiskey costs eight or nine yuan, while each bottle of Chinese whiskey costs one yuan, these people mixed eight bottles of genuine whiskey with four bottles of Chinese whiskey in each dozen for profit. Therefore, last month, they first purchased three dozen bottles of counterfeit liquor from Chen Heting in Room 305 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road, at a price of 75 yuan per dozen (genuine whiskey costs 86 yuan per dozen). Chen was arrested, and then his accomplices Feng Jialuo and Gan Songlin were arrested at No. 27 Zhengde Lane, Zhaofeng Road, and Chen Qinshi and Xue Guisheng were arrested at No. 12 Houde Lane, Kunming Road. Jiang Baoheng was arrested at No. 44 Wufu Lane, Tangshan Road. Qin Baohua, Weng Qiaquan, and Chen Jingui were arrested at No. 67, 3-chome, Kitayongdori, Kobe City, Japan, and Nagoya Port, and transferred to Shanghai. A machine for manufacturing counterfeit liquor and other liquor materials and equipment were found in the upstairs of the Xindan Primary School at No. 373 Yuezhou Road. Three hundred empty bottles were seized at No. 50 Fengsheng Lane, Maohai Road, and taken to the police station and sent to the First Special Court. After several interrogations, the defendants hired many lawyers, including Chen Tingrui and Yan Yinwu, to defend them. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed charges under Articles 339, 253, and 254 of the Criminal Law. After the interrogation was concluded, Judge Ye announced the verdict in Criminal Court No. 2 yesterday morning. The main text of the verdict stated: Qin Baohua was sentenced to four months in prison for jointly and continuously intending to deceive and counterfeit a registered trademark. Feng Jialuo and Weng Qiaquan were sentenced to a fine of 300 yuan each for the same crime. Jiang Baoheng was fined 240 yuan. Chen Heting and Zhao Songlin were each fined 200 yuan for continuously selling goods knowing that they were counterfeit trademarks. Chen Qinshi, Xue Guisheng, and Chen Jingui were each fined 100 yuan for helping others to counterfeit trademarks. If the fine is commuted to labor, it will be calculated at three yuan per day. Two dozen and twelve bottles of counterfeit whiskey, as well as machinery and other items, were confiscated. The remaining items, except for contracts and letters, were returned separately.</p>

<h3>The Sad Story of a Woman, Lu Fengbao: Two Childhood Fiancés Died of Illness; Finally Married a Man Who Turned Out to Be a Bigamist—Failed Attempt to Become a Nun</h3>
<p>Lu Fengbao, a woman from Anhui, is 25 years old this year and currently resides at No. 25 Pi Shao Nai Road, outside the Little North Gate of the French Concession. Her father died when she was only three years old. Because her family was poor, her mother had no way to make a living, so she lived with Wang A'lian (48 years old this year), a fellow villager from Anhui. Wang ran a Wang Gui Ji shoe store on Xinzha Road, Xujiazhai, in the International Settlement. At that time, because Fengbao was young, she was not allowed to work at the store, so she was introduced to the Zhang family in Zhenru Township as a daughter-in-law, and became a childhood fiancée. Before long, the Zhang family's son unfortunately died young. Wang A'lian returned eight yuan to the Zhang family as a refund for the betrothal gifts, and took Fengbao back. When the girl was 13 years old, she was once again engaged to the Liu family in Zhenru Township as a childhood fiancée. At the age of 17, her fiancé, the Liu family's son, fell ill and died again. Wang A'lian again returned sixteen yuan to the Liu family as a refund and took Fengbao back to the Wang Gui Ji shoe store he ran. Unfortunately, Fengbao's mother also died at this time. Wang ordered Fengbao to help take care of household affairs. Over time, in the spring of the 22nd year, Fengbao had an affair with Yang Zhaochang, a shop assistant. It was discovered by her de facto father, Wang A'lian. Since what's done is done, he gave his daughter to Yang Zhaochang as his wife. On the 19th day of the sixth lunar month of that year, he had Fengbao marry Yang and officially live together. At first, the couple's relationship was very close, but good times don't last forever, and the moon is not always full. Fengbao learned that Yang already had a wife living in his hometown. From then on, the couple often quarreled and their relationship broke down. Last month, Yang secretly had an affair with a concubine surnamed Someone and ran away with her, abandoning Fengbao and leaving her alone. At this time, Wang A'lian wanted to rape Fengbao and take her as his wife, but she refused. At this point, Fengbao thought about the hardships she had suffered from childhood to adulthood, and lamented her ill fate. At the end of last month, she went alone to the Tianzhu Nunnery in Hangzhou, intending to ask the head nun to take her in and shave her head to become a nun, wishing to spend the rest of her life with the ancient Buddha and a clear lamp. However, the nun demanded a filial piety fee of 200 yuan, otherwise she would refuse to take her in. Because Fengbao had no money to pay, she had to return to Shanghai and live with a little sister at No. 25 Pi Shao Nai Road. After all, the days are long, and she has no one to rely on. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Yang Zhaochang and her de facto father Wang A'lian of bigamy, abandonment, and offenses against morality, requesting that they be investigated according to the law. She also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting that Wang A'lian be ordered to return the 200 yuan in betrothal gifts she gave to Yang Zhaochang, and the 300 yuan in cash and jewelry that her mother had accumulated over the years and deposited with Wang, for a total of 500 yuan. Based on the complaint, the court summoned the plaintiff Lu Fengbao to the Second Criminal Court for questioning at 10:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Judge Li Changnian. The plaintiff Lu Fengbao arrived on time and stated the above. The defendant Yang Zhaochang was on the run and did not appear. Wang A'lian appeared with his defense lawyer and denied all the allegations. After verifying the testimony in court, he ordered the debate to begin and announced the conclusion. He instructed that the trial of Yang Zhaochang be suspended, and the verdict on Wang A'lian would be announced on the morning of August 6.</p>

In western Shanghai, a store site has been found near Haige Road and Jing'an Temple Road, and preparations are underway. It is heard that the branch there needs to recruit several female employees who can speak English. Those who wish to apply can register at the general store of Zhongxi Pharmacy on Sima Road.</p>
<h3>Good News for Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>The Dazhong Accounting Firm at No. 16, Lane 376, Baker Road, has seen that the call for domestic goods is growing stronger, and the domestic products are becoming more and more complicated. There are many products with excellent quality, but there are also many imitations, which make it difficult for buyers to distinguish between the genuine and the fake, and they often buy inferior goods at high prices. Therefore, the reason why domestic goods cannot be sold well is the crux of the problem. The only way to solve this problem is to register trademarks. After registration, not only the product itself is protected, but also the reputation of the product is improved. Therefore, trademark registration is the only fundamental strategy to promote domestic goods. The firm has taken this into consideration and has made it its responsibility to specialize in trademark registration. Since its establishment, it has been less than half a year, but because of its speed and reliability in handling affairs, and its comprehensive and stable consideration, the number of industrial and commercial circles that have entrusted the firm to handle trademark registration and pharmaceutical inspections has been no less than several hundred. The address of the firm is No. 16, Lane 376, Baker Road, telephone number 34094. Those who need to entrust can go to the firm directly or contact it in writing. The fees are low.</p>

<h3>Zhu Wu Sets Up a Traditional Chinese Painting Studio in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Wu, a famous painter from Shandong, courtesy name Fei Wu, alias Fei You, was skilled in painting at an early age. After entering the school at the age of seventeen, he deeply studied Buddhism but hated superstition. His paintings are mostly inspired by the Tao. In his later years, his reputation became more and more prosperous. His landscapes initially followed Shigu, and later learned from Dong Ju, entering Yuan from Song, and has reached the realm of transformation, doing whatever he wants without losing the rules. He often said to his colleagues that it is biased to learn from people, things, and heart. He should take the image from nature, learn from the ancients, and use his heart. It is not easy to start after Mo Jie. His works are supernatural and consummate. Mr. Zhu has high character and appreciates himself. All the dignitaries in the country want to get Mr. Zhu's handwriting as an honor. Since arriving in Shanghai, he has closed his doors to thank guests and does not want to interact with the world. This summer, at the request of many people, he temporarily set up a traditional Chinese painting studio at No. 314, Xinxin Nanli, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, because it was difficult to refuse. The purpose is to focus on intensive study and practical learning, and not to engage in false fame and embellishment. Although there are already students, other people who are interested in art, regardless of gender, can contact Mr. Gao Ziyu at No. 118, Shanxi Road for simple inquiries.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>After reading your newspaper on July 31, which published a news item titled "The Chief of the Xinzha Public Security Bureau Was Sued by a Woman, Tu Xushi, in the Local Court for Illegal Arrest and Abuse of Power," it was found that Kaiji had not received a summons from the court in this case, and had not entrusted the lawyers Fan Gang and Zhang Fukang to appear in court for defense. The statement in your newspaper that "Lawyer Lu Qi said that Ruan Kaiji has not arrived today, and the court summons has been received. The presiding judge then instructed Lawyer Fan Gang that Ruan Kaiji must obey the summons and appear in court next time. Lawyer Fan said yes," does not conform to the facts. I hereby send a letter to request a correction in order to show the truth. Sincerely, Ruan Kaiji, Chief of the Xinzha Branch Bureau, July 31.</p>

<h3>People, Works, and Criticism</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>Works are man-made. Therefore, every work, except for the stereotyped essays like official documents, is permeated with the author's personality. The deeper the author's personality is permeated in the work, the more the work touches people. At the same time, the greater the social nature of the author's personality, the higher the value of the work permeated by his personality. Therefore, I believe that a top-notch critic must be able to grasp the author's personality from his work. Reviewing a book is to review the person. There is no need to collect the author's irrelevant private life and add malicious attacks.</p>
<p>Of course, personality may have moments of division. Therefore, we can often see people with dual personalities in the world.</p>
<p>The elements that form a person's personality are probably what we call "words" and "deeds." But more precisely, they are "thought" and "behavior." With a certain thought, it is expressed in a certain behavior; that is where the person's knowledge and action are unified, and that is where the person's personality is unified. On the other hand, with a certain thought, but because of social obstacles, the person cannot and dares not express it in behavior; or even gives up on himself and goes with the flow, seeking only to survive. That is when knowledge and action cannot be unified, and the personality is split. That is what we call a person with a dual personality.</p>
<p>In other aspects, society also has its highest standards of specific morality and thought. In a specific society, it often requires the people living in this society to have its specific morality and thought. However, people who hold different kinds of morality and thought often do not blend with this specific society; but the pressure of that specific morality and thought is too great, so he has to express his submission in form. From the perspective of a specific society, this kind of person is undoubtedly a person with a split personality. At the same time, he has no ideals at all; living in this specific society, he takes its specific moral thought as his own moral thought. If this specific society changes, he will also change. From the perspective of this specific society, this kind of person is undoubtedly a person with a complete personality. In history, Cao Cao, who was judged as a traitor, still allows us to grasp the lovable side of his split personality when we read his short songs and other Yuefu poems. "The bright moon is like a mirror, when can it be picked? Sorrow comes from within, and cannot be cut off." It is always a very humane thing to say. Similarly, from the perspective of a specific feudal society, Chen Kongzhang, who fully expressed the complete personality of his loyal master, has had his檄豫州文 passed down and recited by thousands of people to this day because it embodies the highest standards of feudal morality and thought. But "Father Song begged for adoption, stealing Ding Si..., Cao was an ugly eunuch, and had no good virtue..." In our view, it is not enough to be Cao Cao's crime. Therefore, people with split personalities do not necessarily have good works; people with complete personalities do not necessarily have good works. But there is a limit to this, that is, people with split personalities are those who can realize the pain of their split in self-examination. In ancient times, there were probably many writers who produced their great works in this kind of pain.</p>
<p>Moreover, to go a step further, once a work has been typeset with lead type and appeared in front of the public; the work itself has existed as a social existence. This is not only the case for those works that permeate the author's personality, even stereotyped essays like official documents can be regarded as a "social existence." We readers can all find the social basis for its production through this work. Although this social basis of art can be mentioned very accurately and objectively in a complex and diverse society. The social basis for the development of Chinese essays now lies in the fact that the political unrest in society is deepening day by day, and it is more pleasant to express thoughts directly than to think about novels and engage in writing for this reason. If a critic can point out the social basis in his work, he has already given the author a fatal blow more deeply. There is no need to attack the author's private life any further.</p>
<p>I believe that a critic who can cause less unnecessary disputes and point out tendencies in the work itself to improve the literary world is the kind of critic that China needs at this stage. And I hope that such critics will appear!</p>
<h3>Bai Pu's Golden Hairpin</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Yuan Sun Jichang's "Collection of Famous Yongqing Songs from Miscellaneous Dramas" has been carefully analyzed by Zheng Gong Ruihao. It contains 57 kinds of Yuan Dynasty Zaju, of which 55 kinds have been identified by me, and are detailed in my "Rhetoric Lectures" pages 111 to 115 (Beixin Edition). However, there are two kinds that have not been identified, namely "The golden hairpin is slanted in the temple" and "He is like the "Bamboo Forest Temple" with a shadow but no form."</p>
<p>In the Ming Dynasty, Shen Boying translated Wu Changling's words into "Collection of Famous Drama Names", which was published in the first volume of Tai She Xin Zou, pages 3 and 4 "Attached Drama Names", which listed the two drama names "Golden Hairpin" and "Bamboo Forest Temple"; it can be seen that these two names made by Sun Jichang are both Zaju. The source of "Bamboo Forest Temple" has not been identified by me, but "Golden Hairpin" has been resolved. Because today I accidentally flipped through the Beici Guangzhengpu, and unexpectedly found the arrangement of the "Golden Hairpin" set in the table of contents of Volume 3:</p>
<p>Dian Jiangchun Hun Jianglong Chuan Chuangyue</p>
<p>Jishengcao Yuanheling</p>
<p>Shangma Jiao Sha</p>
<p>Then I turned to the text and found two quwen of "Golden Hairpin". Page 29 (Beijing University edition) "Chuan Chuangyue" said:</p>
<p>"Remember the recklessness far away, how can you know that people are complaining about him? Singing and whipping drunk Qing Cong horse. Do not eat Qin Lou wine, thank the tea. Do not think about holding hands and parting."</p>
<p>The title is "Today's hairpin parting", which should be a mistake for "Golden Hairpin parting". Page 41 "Shangma Jiao Sha" said:</p>
<p>"Shangma Jiao has less joy, more troubles (pity), and the heart is chaotic like hemp. Accidentally walking to the east fence, Sha sighs and groans, cold Qing Qing and the moon face the yellow flowers."</p>
<p>Taihe Zhengyinpu Volume 2, page 6 (reprinted by Gushu Liutongchu) also contains "Chuan Chuangyue"; only "Yuan" is made "Zu", and the title is "Bai Renfu Santao". Taihe Zhengyinpu was published earlier than Beici Guangzhengpu, so it seems more reliable. But how could the Yuan Dynasty's Sun Jichang and the Ming Dynasty's Shen Boying both say it was a Zaju? It would be best to see the full text of the set. I then flipped through the scattered songs of Bai Pu compiled by Ren Ne (the three kinds of Yuan Dynasty scattered songs), and saw the full set of "Golden Hairpin Parting" compiled from "Yuefu Xinsheng", including the above-mentioned "Chuan Chuangyue" and "Shangma Jiao Sha":</p>
<p>(Xianlv Dian Jiangchun) Golden Hairpin Parting, Yujing people went to autumn Xiaosa. Coming late at leisure, needlework to tidy up. Leaning alone on the dangerous building, twelve beaded curtains hung. The wind Xiao is bleak, the rain is clear and the clouds are beginning, and the mountains are like paintings.</p>
<p>(Hun Jianglong) The place where the intestines are broken, the remnant sun in the sky, the sunset glow by the water. The withered lotus sleeps in shock, and the distant trees perch on crows. Fallen leaves are densely crowded with stone, and slender bamboos gently sweep the window screens. As dusk approaches, sorrow arises from the pestle, and resentment enters the pipa.</p>
<p>(Chuan Chuangyue) Remember the recklessness that is separated from the horizon, how can you know that people are complaining about him? Singing and whipping drunk Qing Cong horse. Do not eat Qin Lou wine, thank the tea, do not think about holding hands and parting?</p>
<p>(Jishengcao) Leaning on the railing for a long time, I went back to the embroidered curtain, and on the dangerous building I forcibly waved the golden lotus. The deep courtyard, the vermilion gate, stood on the green moss, and the cold penetrated the Lingbo socks. Counting the dates of return, I drew short Qiong hairpins in vain, and wiped away the tears and often wet the fragrant Luo handkerchief.</p>
<p>(Yuanheling) From the wild goose book, how many times did you make the turtle divination. Cui eyebrows are always locked with sorrow of parting, jade face is only haggard. Since the Lantern Festival, I have waited for the Chongyang Festival, why haven't I returned home?</p>
<p>(Shangma Jiao Sha) Less joy, more troubles, and the heart is chaotic like hemp. Accidentally walking to the east fence, sighing and groaning, cold Qing Qing and the moon face the yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The order of this set is completely the same as that of Beici Guangzhengpu; what Li Yu saw should be this set.</p>
<p>But according to my speculation, this set does not seem to be a Zaju, because:</p>
<p>1. Zaju uses Xianlv Dian Jiangchun, which usually follows Bazheng Ganzhou; but this set of Dian Jiangchun does not follow Bazheng Ganzhou.</p>
<p>2. The shortest set of Zaju using Dian Jiangchun is seven chapters, while this set is only six chapters.</p>
<p>3. The commonly used tunes in the Zaju Dian Jiangchun set include You Hulu, Tianxia Le, Nezha Ling, Qu Tazi, Jin Zaner, Houting Hua, Zui Zhongtian, Cunli Qiugu, Liuyao Xu, Qing Geer, Zhansha, Zhanshawei, and Weishi, none of which are in the "Golden Hairpin Parting" set.</p>
<p>4. Bai Pu's set is extremely coherent, just the old tune of boudoir grievances. It does not resemble the ever-changing plot of a drama.</p>
<p>With these four points as proof, I believe that Bai Pu's "Golden Hairpin Parting" is just the first sentence of the Xianlv Dian Jiangchun set, not a Zaju, which was mistaken by Sun Jichang as a Zaju and compiled into "Collection of Famous Zaju Names"; and Shen Boying, a later person, spread the error and also recognized the Golden Hairpin as a Zaju name.</p>
<h3>Night at the Bailing Temple</h3>
<p>— Yuan Chenying</p>
<p>In a yurt, serving as our temporary dining hall, our boys and girls all sat down. The fire in the stove blazed brightly. After two meals a day of stir-fried mutton, steamed buns, and white rice porridge, the smell of mutton still stung my nose, making me nauseous. These two meals were truly unappetizing; stir-fried mutton this, stir-fried mutton that... it all smelled of mutton. For someone as weak as me, it was truly a hardship. I don't know how the Mongols living in the desert manage to survive.</p>
<p>After the meal, the night began to envelop the Mongolian land. Candles were lit in the yurt, and the flickering light made the boys and girls inside fall silent. I, however, was worrying about sleeping at night; without being drowsy, how could I possibly fall asleep in the cold yurt!</p>
<p>Fortunately, at this time, four Mongolian musicians entered the yurt.</p>
<p>The yurt was instantly filled with more of our boys and girls. A group of lamas stood at the entrance, hanging the door curtain. In the wilderness, they were probably like us, rarely able to hear such tragic and magnificent Mongolian music.</p>
<p>The dim candlelight shone on the four young Mongolian musicians with ruddy faces. One was sucking on a flute, one was playing a four-stringed fiddle, one was playing an unknown ancient musical instrument, and the other was a young Mongolian man singing Mongolian songs.</p>
<p>The music began, at first long and slow. The sound was different from anything I had ever heard from any instrument. Gradually, the music became tighter, faster, and more urgent. In a daze, I seemed to hear the north wind outside the yurt harmonizing with the music, like a gust of wind, like a rainstorm. It made us, the boys and girls who had come from afar to this sparsely populated Mongolian land, all feel sad. But it wasn't entirely sadness; it was sadness mixed with heroism! I thought silently: if at this moment the Mongolian soldiers marched forward to the beat of this music, in the darkness of the night, what a magnificent and great scene it would be.</p>
<p>I was lost in wild thoughts. I didn't know where I was. Then the singing began, harmonizing with the unique flute sound, the four-stringed fiddle sound, and the ancient instrument sound. It seemed to be singing a farewell song, and also like singing a love song, but then it turned into an angry, heroic marching song. It made us sometimes sad, sometimes happy, and finally inspired, as if there were enemies ahead waiting for us to charge and kill...</p>
<p>As I was immersed in the atmosphere of music and song, a girl's voice, tinged with sadness, sounded softly in my ear. "What song is he singing?" I turned to look at the girl. Her eyes were moist. I looked again at the young singer. Struggle, despair, striving forward. A whole string of Mongolian songs I couldn't understand poured out of him. I shook my head; I didn't know either!</p>
<p>The singing and music stopped. The boys and girls applauded loudly. The four Mongolian musicians smiled, but soon became silent again. The young man who sang the Mongolian song sighed softly, and then, in the lamplight, silently walked out of the yurt together into the darkness.</p>
<p>Coming out of the yurt, the lamas had also dispersed. The night in the wilderness was a vast expanse. The sky was covered with dark clouds, and not a single star could be seen. The scattered yurts looked like round hills in the darkness. Most of the yurts had turned off their lights. Only a few yurts still leaked some dim light, and occasionally a flashlight shone, emitting a long beam of light, but it quickly went out.</p>
<p>I raised my head and looked around. I couldn't see what was ahead. The cold wind blowing from the north pierced my skin, which was covered by a woolen cloth gown (Note 1), like needles. The Mongolian land seemed to be completely dead. The Mongolian dogs barked, adding to my infinite loneliness.</p>
<p>I thought of the Japanese who came here to make a living during the day, and the post office director's complaints, the silent departure of the Mongolian musicians who had just played, and the young singer's soft sigh. I imagined the future of this Mongolian people and our fate, standing in the darkness for a long time. Suddenly, I remembered a friend saying that there might be wild animals coming out in this Mongolian place at night, so I staggered back to the yurt where I slept and quickly crawled into the quilt.</p>
<p>Note 1: A woolen cloth gown is made of woolen cloth and is unique to Suiyuan. The woolen cloth is woven from wool.</p>
<h3>Farewell</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Fanhai</p>
<p>Sending you back to your homeland,</p>
<p>How unbearable is your homeland to recall!</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of miles stained with the blood of the Jiao soldiers,</p>
<p>In the shell casing, may I ask the white bones,</p>
<p>Where is the loyal soul of my old friend?</p>
<p>Look at your body covered in dust,</p>
<p>Leaving only a desolate, thin frame!</p>
<p>You traveled alone overseas, and now return alone,</p>
<p>Where will you find the old friends who shared ten years of hardship?</p>
<p>Severe frost cannot tame your solitary pride,</p>
<p>Where is not a deserted island?</p>
<h3>University Days (35)</h3>
<p>— By German Storm, Translated by Chen Yinzhizhi</p>
<p>Then she went home. That night, and the next day, she sat and sewed until the valuable garment was completely finished.</p>
<p>"The next day was Sunday," the seamstress continued, after threading a line through the needle eye, "In the evening, when it was late, she inserted a few white May lilies into her black hair, and went to the dance hall.</p>
<p>"What follows, my nephew told me," he added, "He was also someone who wouldn't miss a chance to dance. – At first she sat for a long time, because the young artisans simply didn't dare approach her, and as for the university students, she rejected them one by one. It seemed like trouble was going to break out over her again. That pale-faced, noble university student, what do you call him?"—</p>
<p>"'Count Tu,'" I said. Translated by Chen Yinzhizhi</p>
<p>"Of course, he was also there. But he simply ignored her. Later, he had to come over, because she was dressed too beautifully that night; they said she looked like she was from the eastern Mediterranean coast. But when he walked up to her, her face turned red and her whole body trembled. But now she stood up and gave him her hand. My nephew said that he stared at her, as if he wanted to swallow her whole. She didn't dance with anyone else until the musicians packed up their violins, and then they both left the dance floor."</p>
<p>Lame Mary fell silent here; she only hummed twice, as if to give her story a conclusion. Then she continued her work more diligently than before.</p>
<p>I knew enough; so I decided to go to this "magician's gathering" tonight, in order to see with my own eyes how this story progressed.</p>
<p>In the suburban forest</p>
<p>It was already dark; as I searched for the mountain path in the bushes, the forest was filled with a depressing atmosphere.</p>
<p>I stepped onto the stone steps and couldn't help but stop. I saw several girls in white clothes walking back and forth through the woods, and then going into the house from the side. It seemed like it was time for a dance break; I heard the musicians tuning their violins inside the house, in the brightly lit hall. Students and girls were chatting lively as they passed through the open double doors. I couldn't help but want to go in right away. The little girl's lovely appearance appeared in my mind, and in my thoughts I saw her again hanging on her poor father's neck; I recalled how stubbornly she had rejected my innocent enthusiasm at that time. My heart suddenly felt a kind of pain, and I didn't know whether it was due to sympathy or jealousy?</p>
<p>Finally, I went up the two steps of the small portico and stood unnoticed next to the open door. The break was not over yet, but the inside was no less lively than during the dance. The students sat at tables along the wall or in side rooms, talking and clinking glasses; the girls walked around with smiling faces; and from time to time a dissolute shout echoed throughout the hall.</p>
<p>Among these girls were several lively and lovely faces, immature postures, and passionate, round eyes – emotions of carefree enjoyment or temporary annoyance further enhanced their charm. Although they were daughters of poor families, they were all dressed very cleanly, in uniformly light-colored, transparent clothes, with a flower or a fresh wreath inserted in their carefully woven hair.</p>
<p>But the male dance partners were not as neat and elegant as they were, especially those young students and a few so-called "leaders" of the club, who were simply not afraid to casually stretch their legs onto the tables or stools in front of their female dance partners.</p>
<p>I searched for Nali with my eyes, and soon found her. She was sitting across from the billiard room among several young girls: they were talking lively, but she was silent and looking straight ahead. She had a white rose in her hair, a rare flower in this season; but the rose season on her face had also passed: there was no blush left on her gentle, pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Children's Year Officially Opens Today, Implementing Children's Welfare, the National Government Issues a Special Notice on Two Matters: Implementing Free Education and Providing Relief to Children in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st) The first day of National Children's Year is the 1st. The National Government issued an explicit order on the evening of the 31st, instructing the entire country to earnestly implement matters related to children's welfare. The original order is as follows: Children are the foundation of national life. On the occasion of the beginning of Children's Year, matters related to children's welfare should be implemented according to laws and regulations. An examination of our country's matters regarding children's welfare reveals that school-age children should receive compulsory education, in-school children should receive excellent intellectual and physical training, pregnant women should receive new-method obstetrics, and infants and all children should have increased health and prevention of infectious diseases. Existing provisional laws and various educational regulations, health plans, and sports plans each have explicit provisions. The protection of children's right to life, the employment age and work hours of child laborers and apprentices, etc., have been detailed in special articles in the current criminal law and factory law. International conventions prohibiting the trafficking of women and children have also been signed by our country and various other nations. If they can be implemented, the benefits to children will be considerable. As for the improvement of children's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the rescue of orphans and vagrants, the education of the disabled and mentally retarded, and the improvement of infant care institutions, either there are no laws and regulations to rely on, or although there are some provisions, there are still many omissions. Now, in order to enhance children's welfare and consolidate the foundation of national survival, where there are laws and regulations to rely on but the implementation is weak, all agencies should lead their subordinates, supervise the people of the country, and earnestly comply. Those that have not yet been stipulated or have omissions should be drafted by relevant agencies during the Children's Year and submitted for approval. Compulsory education is of great importance to children's welfare and wisdom and will be implemented starting this year. Currently, disasters are occurring frequently in various places, and the number of children displaced and in need of relief is undoubtedly not small. These two matters should be given special attention. The matter concerns children's welfare and the future of the nation. It is hereby ordered that the entire nation, from top to bottom, be informed and diligently comply. This order.</p>

<p>Preparations</p>
<p>Xue Tianhan, Secretary-General of the Congress, wrote about the preparations for the National Children's Year as follows:</p>
<p>Formulation of the Outline of Implementation Measures for Children's Year</p>
<p>In October of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education drafted an outline of implementation measures for Children's Year and consulted the Ministry of Interior for approval.</p>
<p>In February of the 24th year, the Ministry of Education approved the Ministry of Interior's revised opinions on the outline of implementation measures for National Children's Year. After several consultations between the two ministries, the outline of measures was revised and jointly presented to the Executive Yuan. After receiving the joint presentation from the two ministries, the Executive Yuan convened the heads of the three ministries of Interior, Education, and Industry for detailed review, and also sent letters to the Central Propaganda Committee and the Mass Movement Guidance Committee to send personnel to participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>On March 8th, the two ministries of Interior and Education received instructions from the Executive Yuan: "The outline of implementation measures for National Children's Year presented by the two ministries of Interior and Education has been submitted to the 202nd meeting of the Yuan. It was decided that "the duration of Children's Year shall be from August 1, 1935, to July 31 of the following year, and the rest shall be passed according to the review opinions." The two ministries should promptly draft implementation procedures and submit them to the Yuan for approval."</p>
<p>After receiving the instructions from the Executive Yuan, the two ministries of Interior and Education immediately convened the heads of the three ministries of Interior, Education, and Industry to hold two preparatory meetings on March 16th and 19th to formulate implementation procedures for Children's Year and to pass the organizational regulations and budget estimates of the National Children's Year Implementation Committee.</p>
<p>On March 30th, the two ministries of Interior and Education jointly presented the revised outline of implementation measures for Children's Year and the organizational regulations of the committee to the Executive Yuan for record.</p>
<p>On April 12th, the two ministries of Interior and Education received instructions from the Executive Yuan: "The outline of implementation measures for Children's Year and the organizational regulations of the National Children's Year Implementation Committee have been submitted to the 206th meeting of the Yuan and resolved to be amended and passed. In addition to ordering the provincial and municipal governments to strictly abide by the outline of measures and to publicize the organizational regulations by the Yuan for notification and distribution, the ministry should comply."</p>
<p>The outline of implementation measures for Children's Year, from the drafting of the draft to its promulgation, took a total of seven months. The original draft stipulated that the implementation period would be from April 4, 1935—Children's Day—to April 3 of the following year. Later, due to the limited time and insufficient preparations, the Executive Yuan decided to revise it to be from August 1, 1935, to July 31 of the following year, which is in line with the academic year. In terms of organization, the original draft stipulated that "the implementation of Children's Year shall be jointly led by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, together with the Ministry of Industry, to organize the National Children's Year Implementation Committee." The Executive Yuan revised it to "the implementation of Children's Year shall be jointly led by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Industry, together with the China Child Welfare Association." There are no other major differences.</p>
<p>II. Establishment of the National Children's Year Implementation Committee</p>
<p>After the two ministries of Interior and Education received the instructions from the Executive Yuan approving the outline of implementation measures for Children's Year and the organizational regulations of the committee, they immediately followed the provisions of the regulations to start organizing the National Children's Year Implementation Committee, and drafted the committee's budget estimates - totaling 42,860 yuan - and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review.</p>
<p>On April 26th, the two ministries of Interior and Education received instructions from the Executive Yuan: "The budget estimates for Children's Year have been submitted to the 209th meeting of the Yuan and resolved to be passed."</p>
<p>The budget estimates for the committee have been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the members and staff designated by the three ministries of Interior, Education, and Industry and the members proposed by the China Child Welfare Association have also been decided one after another. On May 14th, the committee announced its 21 members, one secretary-general, and five staff members. The members were appointed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, with five each, two appointed by the Ministry of Industry, three recommended by the China Child Welfare Association, and six appointed. The secretary-general and five staff members were jointly appointed by the two ministries of Interior, Education, and Industry, with two each from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, and one from the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>On May 15th, the two ministries of Interior and Education decided to appoint Gu Shusen, Wu Yanzhou, and Lu Xirong as standing members of the National Children's Year Implementation Committee.

<h3>Children's Year and Children's Welfare: Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, Representing Ma Zongrong, Gave a Speech at the Central Broadcasting Station Last Night</h3>
<p>Last night, on the eve of the opening of Children's Year, Ma Zongrong, a Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Education, representing Minister Wang Shijie, gave a speech at the Central Broadcasting Station entitled "Children's Year and Children's Welfare." The speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the government has already declared that from August 1, 1935, to July 31, 1936, is the Children's Year of the Republic of China. Tomorrow is the day of the national Children's Year opening ceremony. This is a matter worth blessing for the children of our country and celebrating for our Chinese nation. Therefore, today, I would like to raise this issue—Children's Year and Children's Welfare—and discuss it with you.</p>
<p>What is called Children's Year? Simply put, it means striving for children's welfare movements during this year so that children's lives will be happier day by day in the future. This kind of movement is not a new invention unique to China. The United States government held a large-scale child protection movement in 1918. Around 1923, Japan also held a child protection movement. Other countries have also had similar movements.</p>
<p>Why do we want to hold a Children's Year? There are many reasons. Now, I will list four reasons for you.</p>
<p>(1) From the perspective of the inherent human desire, we want to hold a Children's Year. Because all living things have two desires: self-preservation and species preservation. The so-called desire for self-preservation means the desire for a long life. The so-called desire for species preservation means the desire for prosperous descendants. With these two desires, living things can continue to exist and develop infinitely. Both of these desires are important, but from a biological point of view, species preservation is more important than self-preservation. Since humans are one of the living things, they should engage in activities for species preservation. This is one of the reasons we hold a Children's Year.</p>
<p>(2) From the perspective of human ideals, we want to hold a Children's Year. Because humans are animals with ideals. The so-called ideal is the completion of the highest culture that humans can achieve. Human society should reach this ideal and always work hard. In order to achieve this goal, in addition to the hard work of the current people, we also need successors to inherit and strive. That is to say, we need excellent successors—children. This is the second reason why we want to hold a Children's Year.</p>
<p>(3) From the perspective of consolidating the foundation of the nation and society, we want to hold a Children's Year. Because the strength or weakness of the people is closely related to the rise and fall of their country. And the strength or weakness of the people is directly proportional to the health of the children. Therefore, when the United States held a large-scale child protection movement in 1918, its slogan was "Healthy children are the foundation of a great nation." Around 1923, when Japan held a child protection movement, its slogan was "The foundation of a healthy nation begins with children." Therefore, to establish a solid foundation for a healthy country, we must first seek the health of the children, who are its successors. This is the third reason why our country wants to hold a Children's Year.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three reasons, there is one more point to be explained. It is true that all parents in the world love their children. Therefore, some people think that the love of fathers and mothers does not need to be promoted with great fanfare. However, parents in the past mostly held the view that children are their private property. The idea of ​​raising children for the sake of the country and society is relatively lacking, and they cannot fully fulfill their duty of upbringing. Only recently have children enjoyed the right to be raised as members of the nation and society. If the family cannot fully fulfill its duty of upbringing, the nation and society should come forward and raise them personally. However, one thing that must be noted is that although the education of children is originally the primary responsibility of the nation and society, it is most natural and appropriate for families to raise children. Therefore, it cannot be said that the education of children must be directly provided by the nation and society. Only when the family cannot fully fulfill the care of children, or when the children do not have a suitable family, does the nation and society bear the task of educating them. Therefore, the meaning of our holding a Children's Year is, first, to strive to publicize the necessity and methods of child care, in order to deepen the awareness of child care among the people of the country, have a correct understanding, and know the way of upbringing. Second, we want to encourage families, society, and the nation to cooperate and engage in the construction of children's welfare undertakings. This is the fourth reason why we hold a Children's Year. The significance of the government's decision to designate the 24th year of the Republic of China as Children's Year lies in this.</p>
<p>In my previous speech, I used the term "children's welfare undertakings." What is meant by children's welfare undertakings? It can be broadly divided into two categories. First, striving for "the popularization of compulsory education for children." Second, striving to "promote children's protection undertakings."</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the issue of "the popularization of compulsory education for children." Eliminating illiteracy in China is a crucial task. However, to eliminate illiteracy, on the one hand, we must provide adult literacy education to adults who lost their schooling in childhood. On the other hand, we must ensure that all children receive compulsory education. And children's compulsory education is even more important than adult literacy education. Because the number of adults who lost their schooling in childhood is indeed large, but if the number of illiterate children no longer increases, then their number will naturally be limited. As for children, they are born continuously. If the compulsory education of children cannot be popularized, then the source of illiteracy cannot be cut off, hindering the cultural development of the nation and society, which is naturally very large. And the children themselves, because they are illiterate, suffer a lot of pain in their lives.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Executive Yuan's 214th meeting on May 28th of this year has revised and approved the Outline of Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education, which will be implemented starting from the 24th year of the Republic of China. The purpose is to gradually train school-age children across the country through one-year or two-year short-term primary schools, etc., to achieve compulsory education in four-year elementary schools. The implementation process is divided into three phases. The first phase is five years from August 1935 to July 1940. During this period, in addition to expanding four-year elementary schools, existing elementary schools will be converted into two-part systems, existing classes will expand enrollment, existing private schools will be reorganized and improved. Provinces and cities should also run one-year short-term primary schools so that all older out-of-school children and school-age children who have not yet entered school should receive at least one year of compulsory education. Funding has been strictly ordered to be prepared locally, and the central government may provide appropriate subsidies. It has been decided that a subsidy of 240,000 yuan will be allocated in the 24th year of the Republic of China. The training of teachers and the preparation of school buildings are also stipulated in corresponding plans, striving to popularize one-year compulsory education in all provinces and cities by the end of the 28th year of the Republic of China, and for the number of children receiving one-year compulsory education to reach 80% of the number of school-age children. If our ideals can be gradually realized, the benefits to children, society, and the country will be great. At the start of this Children's Year, I would like to plead for the children of the country, hoping that our elders, brothers, sisters, aunts, and uncles will directly and indirectly assist the government in completing the first phase of the compulsory education plan, widely establish one-year short-term primary schools, provide tuition-free education, provide books and school supplies, and continue to work hard to expand four-year elementary schools, so that children across the country have the opportunity to receive education, and illiteracy is eradicated, which will greatly benefit children, society, and the nation.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about "children's protection undertakings." Children's protection undertakings include many things, which can be roughly divided into six types: (1) Maternal protection undertakings, (2) Infant and toddler protection undertakings, (3) Child labor protection undertakings, (4) Rescue undertakings for unfortunate children, (5) Nursing undertakings for weak children, and (6) Reform undertakings for delinquent children.</p>
<p>Maternal protection is to protect pregnant women and maternity women. Because the safe birth of the fetus is not only what parents hope for, but also what the entire society hopes for. Therefore, society should naturally fulfill the obligation to protect children's lives. However, according to statistics, there are often obstacles when children are born. The reason for this is that maternal protection undertakings have not been fully considered, and maternal education has not been thorough enough. Therefore, maternal protection is an indispensable part of children's protection undertakings.</p>
<p>Secondly, although infants and toddlers have been safely born, if they cannot grow up healthily, such as death or physical weakness, creating weak citizens, it is not only a loss for the parents of infants and toddlers. Therefore, infants and toddlers need to be fully protected.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the protection of working children. The so-called protection of child labor means not allowing children to engage in inappropriate labor. Whether it is engaging in their own family business or helping others with work, any labor that hinders the physical and mental development of children is prohibited.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the rescue of unfortunate children. The so-called unfortunate children, such as abused children, orphans, abandoned children, etc., have very poor environments. If they are ignored, it is not only intolerable from a humanitarian point of view, but also hinders the development of society. Therefore, the rescue of unfortunate children is a noteworthy children's protection undertaking.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the nursing of weak children. The so-called weak children are children with anemia, weak hearts, weak lungs, etc. Because of their physical weakness, these children cannot keep pace with ordinary children in all activities, and may even be in danger of dying young. Therefore, targeting these children and providing them with special care to restore their health and join ordinary children is also a necessary children's protection undertaking.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the reform of delinquent children. Because the crime rate of children has been increasing in recent years. This is a common fact in all countries. Although punishment is imposed, the effect of reforming and doing good is very small. Therefore, for these children, it is better to protect them and actively reform and educate them, so that they know that crime is shameful, and cultivate their willpower to overcome bad temptations, in order to complete the ideal of educating everyone regardless of their background and making the best use of everything.</p>
<p>Other things such as the education of children with physical or mental abnormalities, such as blind children, deaf-mute children, disabled children, mentally retarded children, and idiotic children, can also be regarded as children's protection undertakings in a broad sense.</p>
<p>Based on the meaning of Children's Year mentioned above, after the opening of Children's Year, we must gradually work hard on the following practical facilities to promote children's welfare:</p>
<p>(1) Implement parental education to publicize the idea of ​​caring for children and to make their protection methods scientific.</p>
<p>(2) Popularize compulsory education for children so that children can have equal opportunities for education and welfare.</p>
<p>(3) Widely establish mother consultation centers, maternity hospitals, infant homes, milk supply stations, nurseries, children's health consultation centers, etc., to protect infants and toddlers.</p>
<p>(4) Formulate child labor laws, strive to protect the health of working children, widely implement apprenticeship education, and widely establish vocational guidance centers to protect child labor.</p>
<p>(5) Widely issue children's abuse prevention orders and establish orphanages for the blind, and formulate children's abuse laws to rescue unfortunate children.</p>
<p>(6) Widely establish summer health camps, forest schools, and seaside schools to care for weak children.</p>
<p>(7) Establish reformatories and formulate juvenile protection laws to protect delinquent children.</p>
<p>(8) Widely establish schools for the blind and deaf, schools for the disabled, etc., to protect children with abnormalities.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned facilities can be gradually realized, children across China will enjoy boundless blessings. I would like to bless all the children in the country on the eve of the opening of the National Children's Year.</p>

<p>Chapter One New Boundary</p>
<p>A public carriage came clattering from afar and stopped in front of the gate of a large mansion. The coachman reined in the horse and let down a scantily clad child. Someone opened the fenced gate to welcome him. The child hurriedly asked, "Sir, please tell me, is this Plumfield?"</p>
<p>"Yes, who sent you?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Laurie. I also brought a letter to the lady of the house here."</p>
<p>"Alright; that house, give her the letter; she will take care of you, little shaver."</p>
<p>The man's tone had a pleasant quality. Nat Blake—for that was the child's name—was encouraged by these words and walked along feeling very comfortable. At that time, it was drizzling, sprinkling on the soft grass and budding flowers and trees. Looking from the soft spring rain, Nat saw a large square house in front of him—it had a pleasant and welcoming atmosphere, because it had wide verandas, spacious steps, and many windows, and many lights were shining through the windows. There were obviously no shutters or curtains installed inside, so the joyful light would shine through the windows; before he knocked on the door, he hesitated slightly, seeing countless small shadows dancing on the wall inside, and vaguely hearing the pleasant voices of many teenagers. He thought to himself that such brightness, warmth, and comfort inside the house, a lonely and helpless "little shaver" like him would not be a part of.</p>
<p>Even so, he still thought to himself, "I hope the lady of the house will really take care of me;" so he picked up the big brass knob on the door—in the shape of a laughing old man's head—and knocked lightly.</p>
<p>Then a rosy-cheeked maid opened the door. He silently handed over the letter. She took it, smiling. She seemed used to receiving strange children, because she pointed to a seat in a small room inside the door, nodded to him, and said:</p>
<p>"Sit there and rest on the mat for a while, let me take this to Madam."</p>
<p>While Nat was waiting, he saw many things that were entertaining. He looked around with an excited expression, feeling that the scene was very interesting. At the same time, he secretly rejoiced that he could hide in a corner near the door to observe everything, and he would not be seen by others.</p>

<h3>Finance: Rumors Dispelled; Gold Prices Plunge by 18 Yuan; Bullish Sentiment Weakens, Reaching the 880 Yuan Level; Government Bonds Collected at a Rate of Just Over 32 Percent</h3>
<p>The gold market has recently experienced repeated sharp price increases, even breaking through the 900 Yuan mark. Unexpectedly, yesterday, rumors of government intervention suddenly spread, causing a reversal in sentiment and a sudden drop. Some long positions were liquidated, buying interest waned, and the downward momentum was extremely strong, nearly reaching the 880 Yuan level. It was observed that the overseas silver markets in both England and the United States were stable in the morning. Furthermore, there was talk in the big trading circles of demand exceeding supply at the closing price. The forward silver price in Menterley rose by 1.5 to 2%, and although the exchange rate contracted slightly and the price of raw gold in London fell by 2%, confidence was difficult to restore. A report from the Shanghai News Agency stated that, according to the results of an inquiry by the Jardine Matheson Bank to the authorities, the actual inflation rate was still far off, which fueled selling interest. The opening price for off-exchange forward transactions immediately dropped to 945 Yuan. Fuxing, Yongchun, Yuan, Yonghui, and Lu sold at 90 Yuan. Dadecheng, Yongli, Fuxing, Yonghong, Kang, Yongwan, Xing, Hengyu all came to purchase contracts, rebounding to over 5 Yuan. After the opening, the Central Bank's posted exchange rate was announced, and both England and the United States reported heavy losses. The customs gold unit rose by 2.2%, and the standard price for the bid gold rose even further to 907.1 Yuan, stirring up sentiment and driving prices higher for a time. However, the foreign exchange market continued to be weak, and large players jointly divested their holdings, soon retreating into the 90 Yuan range. Buyers took advantage of the low prices, anticipating that the HSBC exchange rate would be stable for both England and the United States and that prices could rise. Unfortunately, Sassoon and other firms blocked the rise, the foreign exchange market remained firm, and the upward momentum was weak. Sentiment remained pessimistic, and selling interest continued to increase, causing prices to decline further. After the Hong Kong market eased and then strengthened, although prices fell at this time, they remained stable and occasionally rebounded to over 90 Yuan. However, with confidence difficult to restore, large players repeatedly sold off, causing some wavering among the long positions. The rise was only temporary, and selling pressure soon followed. Although the prediction for Indian silver was for a rise, the market still lacked support, and rumors of government intervention spread throughout the venue. By noon, prices had fallen to nearly the 80 Yuan range, before stabilizing somewhat at the end. The situation for the first half of the day was quite pessimistic, which was a reaction to the continuous price increases in recent days. The collection of government bonds for August began today, with just over 32 percent of the bonds released by short positions yesterday. Below is a record of the market situation for the first half of the day:</p>

<h3>Banks Have More to Offer Than Demand; The Foreign Exchange Market Suddenly Becomes Loose and OverSupplied</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign news agencies, large sterling in London and Milesyuan were stable, and the silver price in New York did not change. The forward silver market in Menterley rose by 1.5 to 2%, the price of raw gold in London fell by 2%, the GBP/USD shrank by 125, the GBP/FRF fell by 10 pounds, the USD/GBP shrank by 125, and the USD/FRF rose by 125.

The opening price of the foreign exchange market was 1 shilling 6 pence 0625 for near-term sterling and 27.3125 for USD, with sterling losing 0625 and USD strengthening 125 compared to the previous close. The hard continued, but the Central Bank's posting was announced, with sterling shrinking by 25 and USD shrinking by 5615, and customs gold rising by 2.2%, boosting confidence. However, there was a market without transactions in the domestic market, and banks and Sassoon had some blocking, which hardened the situation. However, because it was anticipated that HSBC would post the same price for both sterling and USD, HSBC was still struggling and making some efforts. However, with banks having more to offer than demand, the situation remained loose. Even with HSBC's occasional support, there was only slight hovering. The Hong Kong market initially eased and then tightened, with the process being even more hesitant. Overall, Chinese merchants were psychologically weak, and banks lacked much buying interest. Ultimately, without support, the trend gradually became harder. By the noon close, the selling price for near-term sterling was 1 shilling 6 pence 175 and the selling price for USD was 27.38 Yuan, with sterling easing 375 and USD strengthening 8215 compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants initially dug and then blocked, rolling out about 50,000+ pounds sterling and 200,000+ USD. HSBC was inclined to dig, below is a record of the achievements for the first half of the day:</p>
<p>The morning opening price for near-term sterling was 1 shilling 6 pence 0625. Three days were sold to Huayidewahu in October 5 pence 175.

As for the collection aspect, due to the month-end settlement period and the large influx of Japanese goods this month, there were also many foreign exchange transactions. Although the liquidity situation did not tighten, it did not loosen either, causing considerable constraints and making it difficult to sort things out in the short term. It was expected that things would ease by 8 or 9 pm. It was anticipated that the total amount settled for the day would be around 60-70 million, but the exact number would be reported the next day.</p>
<p>As for Jiangsu rain small silver dollars, the morning market would increase by 1.5 Yuan, opening at 838 Yuan, but the afternoon market closed with few transactions, retreating to Yuan, changed to 836 Yuan, so the result was still 0.5 Yuan smaller than the previous market.

<h3>Securities: Major Players Cutting Long Positions; Government Bonds Plunge by Over One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sharp cutting of long positions by No. 48 at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange caused considerable indigestion among the long positions. General retail investors, following the movements of No. 48, also followed the trend, causing the number of chips to increase. The wind of decline suddenly arose, and the momentum was quite fierce. In the morning, as soon as the news of consolidation was announced, prices plunged by over one Yuan. Layoffs followed, and prices plunged by another 1.5 Yuan, with the forward price plummeting by a significant 1.8 Yuan. With No. 48 having a strong selling intention, the selling from No. 9 also surged. The front generally followed the trend and sold off, with each of the 20-year customs consolidated tax revenue dropping by about 1.5 Yuan. Later, No. 4 made strenuous efforts to pull prices up, and No. 33 also absorbed some of the selling, and the decline slowed somewhat. No. 4 continued to sell off 96 public bonds, and the market price fell by another half a Yuan. The second session was still sluggish at the beginning. After entering, No. 48 slightly stopped selling, and the short positions on the floor replenished their positions, and each bond slightly rebounded by about 2-5 tenths of a Yuan. However, based on the observation of the situation, it was not yet an official turning point. In summary, the results of the two sessions were a uniform sharp drop of 2.5 to 7 tenths of a Yuan, with a total transaction volume of 24,940,000 Yuan. The high and low results are listed in the comparative table on the left (unit: Yuan, transaction unit: 100 Yuan).</p>

<h3>Gauze Yarn: Chip Slackness and Abuse Strike Gauze Market Rise, Actual Sales Stagnate...Bull Market Concludes...Reaction Initiates</h3>
<p>The gauze market rose by five yuan the previous day, prompting profit-takers to close out. Now, a reaction has begun, and the market has fallen. This situation is entirely due to speculative merchants developing fanatical thoughts, with most releasing empty promises into the market, making people uncertain. The market is full of chips, and prices fluctuate. However, the bulls in the banking sector have slightly reduced their positions, but some parties are still tightening and not letting go. Nevertheless, current gauze business feels increasingly sluggish.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Falls Back Around Two Yuan: Before the opening of the marked yarn market, most discussions were unanimously bullish due to the organization of a bull company by certain parties. This led general speculative merchants to be bullish and their thoughts to be fanatical. Unexpectedly, upon opening, the market suddenly loosened, and chips were abundant. It was heard that the marked price fell below the 900 yuan mark, and public bonds also fell. At the same time, there was talk of currency issuance, which was difficult to realize immediately. Sellers surged like a tide, as many had been in a profitable position after days of frantic rises. Upon receiving bad news, they naturally rushed to close out and sell. As a result, prices for all months fell by 1.5 to 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw rumors unfavorable to the bulls, causing a slight drop. By the third closing, Changfeng made purchases, and the market price rebounded. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.2 to 1.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 1,350 bales of Tongfu, 2,500 bales of Tongji, 750 bales of Dafeng, 2,550 bales of Jinchang, 1,650 bales of Changyu, 2,200 bales of Shenji, 1,450 bales of Yuan Yi, 2,200 bales of Run Kang, 1,200 bales of Suilan, and 850 bales of Tong Ge. Purchases included 1,050 bales of Dafeng and 2,600 bales of Dafu. 1,800 bales of Yida, 2,250 bales of Suilong, 9,050 bales of Mingde, 1,250 bales of Da, and 6,250 bales of Changfeng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn: Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Change, Account Balance</p>
<p>August: 177.7, 177.7, 177.6, Down 1.10, 41.85</p>
<p>September: 177.9, 176.6, 177.9, 1.70, 42,190</p>
<p>October: 177.7, 176.7, 177.7, 1.70, 65,490</p>

<p>Sales of Local Yarn Do Not Reach 600 Bales: Spot yarn sales are sluggish. Total purchases for the day are estimated at 570 bales, with flat prices. 300 bales of Japanese yarn were traded, with prices rising by 1.2 yuan. Purchases by various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Changsha: 158, Guangdong: 210, Mainland: 45</p>
<p>Jiangxi: 0, Tianjin: 10, Xuzhou: 10</p>
<p>Counterparts: 100</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Fall Back, Cotton Reacts and Declines</h3>
<p>After a continuous surge in the cotton market, a reaction and decline were expected. However, the concept of squeezing the shorts for the August contract deepened the decline, while the situation for distant months eased slightly. According to some, bull companies bought the August and October contracts and hedged out the November and December contracts. However, the overseas cotton industry situation remains weak.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao and Others Drop by Half a Yuan: At the opening of the marked cotton market, it was heard that the marked price also entered the 900 yuan mark. The situation changed drastically, and rumors of currency issuance resurfaced. As a result, a reaction suddenly occurred, and the market was flooded with chips. This situation was entirely a reflection of the excessive bullishness of the previous day. As a result, near months fell by 0.4 to 0.6 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and distant months fell by 0.8 to 0.85 yuan. At the afternoon opening, the market suddenly tightened, and most people still tended to buy, causing prices to rebound. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 2,600 dan of Changhe, 1,500 dan of Xincheng, 2,400 dan of Jifeng, 3,200 dan of Tongfu, 1,000 dan of Tongji, 6,100 dan of Dafeng, 1,200 dan of Hexing. 2,000 dan of Chang. 8,600 dan of Shenji, 5,900 dan of Changfeng, 10,600 dan of Run Kang, 1,600 dan of Xieceng. Purchases included 10,000 dan of Dafu, 10,800 dan of Suilong, 1,800 dan of Tomorrow, 1,500 dan of Zhenda, 6,000 dan of Ruida, 1,500 dan of Yicheng, 1,700 dan of Dachangcheng, 5,100 dan of Yichang, and 6,700 dan of Yifeng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Marked Cotton: Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Change, Account Balance</p>
<p>August: 25.80, 25.50, 25.80, Down 0.10, 236,600</p>
<p>October: 24.0, 24.50, 24.15, 0.45, 38,200</p>
<p>November: 24.30, 24.00, 24.15, 0.5, 194,200</p>
<p>December: 24.45, 24.10, 24.55, 0.60, 145,800</p>
<p>Total: 694,900</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Sales Stagnate: Spot cotton mills need to stop. Sources include 470 bales of Yao cotton and 549 bales of Tongzhou cotton.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton: 49.15, Tongxing Factory Received: 82 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton: 19.00, Gongda Factory Received: 10 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<h3>Hankou Cotton Market Slightly Firm, Sales Lag</h3>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The recent situation of cotton in Hankou is still sluggish. However, the Shanghai marked cotton has risen, increasing by more than four yuan per dan. However, in Hankou, due to severe flooding, the Feng'an factory has stopped production due to being flooded. The Minsheng and No. 1 yarn factories have stopped work due to the downturn in the yarn market. Currently, only the Yuhua and Shenxin factories are operating as usual. Local sales have decreased sharply. Exports could have improved, but buyers have difficulty transferring funds, so transactions are still small. Factory sales: Shenxin purchased 100 large pieces of Chengzhan product, priced at 18.4 yuan. Exports: Songmao Chang also purchased 100 pieces of Xinyue product, priced at 27.8 yuan, and Huang Yixing purchased 110 bales of Lishan Huantan, priced at 27.7 yuan. Total market scale: 820 dan, with prices rising by about 0.5 yuan. Total cotton in storage is about 110,000 dan. Shengxing warehouse has about 20,000 dan. In addition to the Postal Savings Bureau's storage and packing factory, there are still more than 90,000 dan. The market still has a tendency to rise.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Production Expected to Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with sluggish conditions, with monthly changes up to a few points per pound. In the early morning, it weakened due to profit-taking and hedging. At the same time, the weather continued to be favorable, and private estimates suggested an increase in production. Therefore, although Liverpool news was firm, it could not reverse the weak trend. New Orleans was selling heavily. It is rumored that there may be an extension of the old loan before the announcement of the new loan. However, there has been no news from official sources. Spot cotton deliveries are not high, and textiles are calm. The closing was stable. Spot goods fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 1 to 5 points. British cotton spot goods fell by 6 points, and futures fell by 2 points. Indian cotton transactions were not high, and speculators made slight purchases. Pingguo'er fell by 0.75 rupees, Aomula remained unchanged, and Bairoxi fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees. Original telegrams are recorded on the left (telegram of the 30th):</p>
<p>US Cotton: Compared to Previous Day (Equivalent National Currency), British Cotton: Compared to Previous Day (Taiwan National Currency)</p>
<p>October: 11.46 (Down 4), 23.80, Spot: 678 (Down 6), 41.50</p>

<p>Aomula: 195.25 (Flat), 27.80</p>
<p>Bairoxi: 219.25 (Down 0.75), 22.40</p>
<p>April/May: 36.50, 0.50, 30.40</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for April/May Bairoxi cotton on the 31st was 216.5 rupees, the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3>Hubei New Cotton Production Damaged by Floods</h3>
<p>Cotton-producing areas in Hubei Province have suffered significant damage due to floods. Recent estimates put production at around 1.8 million dan. However, the floodwaters have receded quickly, which seems optimistic. According to recent surveys, there is hope for about 1.9 million dan. Last year's estimate was 2.2 million dan, but the actual harvest was 1.7 million dan. This year, the cotton fields have increased compared to last year. The areas along the Pinghan and Yangtze Rivers near Hankou could have had a bumper harvest this year, but the floods caused about 30% of the loss, which is no less than the same period last year.</p>
<h3>Grains: About 600,000 Bags of Imported Rice in Stock</h3>
<p>Since the continuous import of foreign rice, the rice market has remained stable. However, current arrivals have stopped, and the stock is gradually decreasing. Yesterday, according to a survey of rice merchants, the stock in each warehouse is as follows:</p>
<p>Hexing Warehouse: 11,000 bags, Yitaixing: 180,000 bags, Company Warehouse: 12,000 bags, Hongsheng: 17,000 bags, Qichang: 30,000 bags, Taikoo: 4,000 bags, China Merchants Southern Warehouse: 5,000 bags, Dalai Warehouse: 1,600 bags, Yuan Mao Warehouse: 21,000 bags, Huatong Warehouse: 18,000 bags, Longmao: 70,000 bags, Hua Warehouse: 10,000 bags, Zhong Warehouse: 18,000 bags. There are more than 100,000 bags in other warehouses not listed above, with a total stock of about 570,000 to 80,000 bags. In addition, there is another ship en route, expected to arrive in two to three days, carrying 20,000 bags of Saigon rice. In total, there are more than 600,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Both Dugen and Imported Rice Show Improvement</h3>
<p>Local rice (South Shanghai): Yesterday, the total arrival from various sources was the 17th (a total of 1,560 shi). Although sales in the local market were not good, sellers only focused on minimizing losses, so the situation was stable. The price of thick japonica rice did not fluctuate, while thin indica rice, including more than 1,000 bags from Tianjin, Longkou, and Yantai, also saw some movement, indicating a stable but tight market. Fresh high-quality goods have already risen by several points. The Dongxin japonica rice, after the initial opening, has been falling all the way, reaching a price of 10 yuan. Therefore, it may hover around this 10-yuan mark. The Luxian goods with Daixiu Yijiao have not yet opened at a price below 10 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai): Yesterday, there were 14 or 15 arrivals from various sources along the river. The market for ground white japonica rice was average, with prices flat and weak. 240 to 250 shi of Dongxin japonica rice arrived, and the market price was stable. The arrival and sales of thin indica rice were balanced, and prices turned soft. White Yuan and other goods were stable.</p>
<p>Imported rice: Yesterday, the market situation became firmer due to decreasing stock, unfavorable prices for future orders, and the cessation of new arrivals. Both domestic and merchant houses were unanimously optimistic. Domestic and Yangtze River groups inquired, and prices immediately rose by 1.1 to 1.2 yuan. 8,000 bags of Saigon, Xiaojiao, and Gao Guan Siamese rice were sold throughout the day. Cargo owners are still bullish. If local customers buy more in the next day or two, market prices may rise further.</p>
<h3>Little Volume of Flour, Wheat, and Soybean Cakes Traded; Spot Wheat Market Still Good</h3>
<p>Transactions of miscellaneous grains have not been brisk. Wheat deliveries totaled only seven cars, including two cars of Ren Cheng, three cars of Shen Chang Wen, one car of Run De, and one car of Ding Tai. Purchasers included Zhi Cheng Yong, who received six cars, and Heng Sheng Jiu, who received one car. Soybean cake deliveries totaled 4,000 pieces, which were received by domestic merchants. 100 dan of marked oil was received by the local market.</p>
<p>The spot wheat market remains good. High-quality goods have risen by another 0.03 to 0.05 yuan, while mid-quality goods remain unchanged. Prices include Suzhou Shandong wheat at 3.64 yuan, Zhangbaling Yaowan wheat at 3.62 yuan, Daji Ji wheat at 3.60 yuan, Daqiao Gaoyou wheat at 3.57 to 3.58 yuan, and mid-quality goods at 3.50 yuan. Shiying wheat at 3.585 yuan, and mid-quality goods at 3.58 yuan. Liuhe wheat at 3.54 yuan, and mid-quality goods at 3.52 to 3.53 yuan. Zhenjiang wheat at 3.47 yuan, Nanjing wheat at 3.37 yuan, and Danyang wheat at 3.55 yuan, Jiangxin Zhou wheat at 3.535 yuan. Fuxin purchased 7,000 bags, Shenda purchased 2,000 bags, and Xinda purchased 1,500 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery of last month's flour futures. The actual quantity was very small. Only Jiufeng's Shanlu delivered 7,000 bags, which were received by local brokers in small quantities. According to Tianjin sources, more than 100,000 bags were received at the end of the month, priced according to the standard at the time. The market outlook is rumored to be related to currency issuance, which is unreliable. Public sentiment may ease, but manufacturers have not accumulated much inventory, so they may be able to temporarily hold on.</p>
<p>According to telegrams, the condition of European crops is quite good, and the market was weak at the end, causing market conditions to loosen. It is predicted that private estimates will decrease sharply, and purchases can be made when prices soften again.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat (July 29th, July 30th, Change)</p>
<p>September: 92.75, 91.875, Down 0.875</p>
<p>December: 93.50, 92.875, Down 0.625</p>
<p>Spot: 106.25, 104.25, Down 1.875</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat</p>
<p>August: 85.375, 84.875, Down 0.20</p>
<h3>Jiujiang New Bean Market Stable, Arrivals Limited, Bean Cake Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The Jiujiang new bean market is quite stable because arrivals are limited. Yesterday, only 45 bags arrived. The goods were similar to before, and the price opened at 3.8 yuan, purchased by the Ningbo group. Currently, the new bean market in various regions is delayed, but sales outlets are already waiting. Only Jiujiang and other beans are on the market, so market conditions are quite stable. The bean cake market was stable in the morning, but in the afternoon, because the source of guest cakes was cut off, market sentiment rose slightly. A total of more than 9,000 pieces of guest cakes and more than 24,000 pieces of various brands of factory cakes were traded.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Prices Too Low, Major Turnaround Expected, Yokohama and New York Silk Markets Gradually Return to Normal, Local Silk Weaving Factories Also Raise Prices, B-Grade White Filature Already Up 50-80 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the silk market has been soaring due to strong foreign demand and the help of low silver prices. B-grade white filature with a grade of 20 to 22 is 50 to 80 yuan higher than last month. Shanghai silk merchants are vying to sell, and futures have already opened until October. Therefore, although the silk factories are in the hot summer, they are still running at full capacity to catch up. The future of the silk industry seems quite optimistic. According to current sentiment and Lanben's estimates, the rising trend of silk prices still has some momentum to maintain.</p>
<p>The Yokohama and New York silk markets also once soared, even with a difference of 60 yuan between near and far months. Now they are gradually returning to normal, but market sentiment is not strong, just like the local market.</p>
<p>Local silk weaving factories have also moderately raised prices this month (August) due to the rising price of silk, so it is not comparable to last month.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Soars in Hankou, Foreign Firms Sell for 47 Yuan per Dan</h3>
<p>The rise and fall of the white tung oil market are entirely tied to the prosperity of exports. This year's foreign trade seems to be more prosperous than in previous years. Therefore, from spring to summer, in the past six months, the price has risen by 14 to 15 yuan per dan. The strength of the rise is unprecedented in the past four or five years. And last week's rise was even more intense. The price of foreign firms in Hankou last week only increased from 39.56 yuan to 40.07 yuan. But since the foreign firms stationed in Hankou started purchasing last week, vying with each other, it was like a scramble, so the price increased every day for a week. It has increased to 47 yuan the day before yesterday. In just one week, it has increased by 6.34 yuan. The strength of the rise has broken the latest record. And all the producing areas have already been almost completely searched by foreign firms. So since the summer, there has been a report of insufficient storage. And recently it is even more so. From the perspective of foreign firms, the demand for goods is still strong, and their efforts to continue are difficult to stop for a while, so the rise in the market cannot be determined. In addition, domestic sales are also starting, and although the number is limited, it does not help its power. It is heard that those who owe money for Zhejiang Tung oil also have to sell for more than 39 yuan per cu, which already shows that things are rare and expensive.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Sugar Slightly Improves</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, although the tariff was slightly loose, the trend was still tight. The guild's closing price for No. 24 raw granulated white spot was raised by 0.1 yuan to 16.7 yuan, and the price for re-exported goods was 5.1 yuan, but there were no transactions. This factory's cotton white, Zhenyu No. 1 yesterday was 15.8 yuan, and there were transactions. No. 2 was 7 yuan, No. 3 was 5.5 yuan, and No. 4 was 4 yuan. The Chaoqing number plate has lacked activity for a long time. Now it is the opportunity for a turnaround, and it has improved slightly. Yesterday, more than 200 bags of Chongti Zhuang opened at 9.95 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 9.8 yuan, and Long Qing at 9.3 yuan. Secondary products were slightly reduced, but they rose by a few points. It is heard that more than 1,000 bags of Hainan red secret plate continued to open, and the price did not fluctuate, because the goods are more common.</p>

<h3>Children's Year and Students' National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Clap your hands and laugh! Today is the opening day of Children's Year. Many children are happily welcoming this lovely, precious, celebrated, and joyful Children's Year. Everyone's little mind is filled with indescribable happiness. But looking back, children, don't forget that this year is not only Children's Year but also the very memorable and precious Student National Goods Year. Especially, don't forget that Chinese children should use Chinese goods. I've put together a few short, unpolished songs to present to all the children:</p>
<p>Children! There are countless ways to love your country,</p>
<p>Using national goods is the most important.</p>
<p>Stopping import surpluses and recovering outflowing money,</p>
<p>A large part of the responsibility lies on our little shoulders.</p>
<p>No matter how gorgeous and beautiful, if it's not a national product, I won't cherish it.</p>
<p>No matter how fashionable and beautiful, if it's not a national product, I won't crave it.</p>
<p>I love national goods, my determination is extremely firm,</p>
<p>I use national goods, my heart is at peace.</p>
<p>If I want to persuade others, I should lead the way.</p>
<p>Go ahead, protect our rights.</p>
<p>Don't let down this Student National Goods Year,</p>
<p>Then we'll be worthy of this lovely Children's Year.</p>
<p>Children! Look at the children of other countries. They've developed a "four no" principle from a young age and adhere to it until death. What are the four "no"s?</p>
<p>No eating non-national goods,</p>
<p>No wearing non-national goods,</p>
<p>No using non-national goods,</p>
<p>No playing with non-national goods.</p>
<p>These are deeply ingrained ideas in their little minds from a young age, you could say they're innate. We as parents should train our children to have these habits, and as children, we must develop these concepts from a young age. It's exactly: "If you want a prosperous and strong nation, children, mothers must never forget the national goods in their hearts."</p>
<h3>Student National Goods Year and University Students</h3>
<p>— Ruoyu</p>
<p>The global economic panic of 1928 can be said to have swept across all countries, and it has become more and more intense without any signs of stopping. China, which is backward and has lost all its guarantees, and its industry and commerce, which had only recently begun to develop, have suffered such a blow from this狂潮猛浪. How could they be able to withstand it! Therefore, in recent years, the outflow of large amounts of cash has been like a滔滔不息 river. Watching the snow-white silver in the country dry up day by day, resulting in the decline of industry and commerce and the bankruptcy of rural areas, the entire society has reached a state of universal poverty. People of insight, seeing this dangerous situation, feel that fundamentally promoting national goods is the only way to save the nation and survive. This year is designated as the National Goods Year to take a further step, starting with students, in order to achieve effective results. Because today's Chinese students are generally respected by the people. Although it is no longer as noble as in the old days when "all other professions are inferior, only studying is superior", today's students - especially university students - are still the elite of the country. Their words and actions can still influence the people's eyes and ears, and leading the masses is still a definite fact.</p>
<p>Therefore, during the current Student National Goods Year, how should every student - especially university students - adhere to this purpose and do it practically, as a role model for the people? However, in fact, today's students - especially university students - often cannot achieve this. Usually, in their clothing, food, housing, and transportation, they only see them in Western suits and leather shoes, using foreign goods. They have ended up in the opposite situation. This is truly a painful thing. I say this not without reason, and not to create rumors to sensationalize. Because I recently saw a university professor, and I asked him how the life of today's university students is? He immediately shook his head and said: "It's getting worse and worse. They simply don't want to study more, they just want to get a qualification, find a way out and be done with it. When they first came out of the countryside and entered school, they could still study very hard, and they could still wear old cloth gowns. But after only three months, they all put on Western suits, leather shoes, and filled their hair with Stanco. As for studying, it is becoming increasingly tasteless. Some even spend their days at the ballrooms and pursuing women." After hearing this, I was really a little dazed! At the same time, I thought of this year being the Student National Goods Year, so I unconsciously wrote this passage to reveal it to the people - especially university students. It is best to be able to "correct it if you have it, and strive to do better if you don't." And for the current Chinese situation, we can also carefully reflect on how to use national goods as much as possible in our daily lives and use them as an advocate for the people. Only then will we not fail this Student National Goods Year!</p>
<h3>My View on "National Goods Control"</h3>
<p>— Xiaobai</p>
<p>The calls for "industrial control" and "economic control" have become increasingly loud recently. Since the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Goods League presented a joint petition to the central government last month, requesting the implementation of national goods control, followed by the rubber industry's voluntary request for government control, in the bleak future of national goods, many people have focused on the control of national goods to find a way out. Although, according to general discussion, the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom, the praise and criticism of national goods control are still mixed, but everyone undoubtedly attaches importance to the study of implementing national goods control. Therefore, I also dare to express some of my humble opinions here.</p>
<p>At present, most people hold a very skeptical attitude towards whether China should implement national goods control. They believe that our country is a country with backward production, so they are afraid that after the implementation of national goods control, it will affect the free development of the new industry in the bud, and foreign factories in China, due to special relations, will expand instead. This point is indeed worthy of our in-depth study.</p>
<p>However, we must know that the greatest purpose of national goods control is not only to complete the self-sufficiency of national goods in production and consumption, but also to complete the development of foreign trade and oppose the dumping of foreign goods in exchange, and to promote the sharpening of the national goods movement. Therefore, in my opinion, assuming that national goods control can be carried out under the two principles of "planned national goods production" and "self-sufficiency of national goods", it is a very correct direction. Now I will write out my two implementation methods:</p>
<p>1.  Active control: For all raw materials and manufactured goods that must be imported from foreigners, we must, under a strict plan, restrict the concentration of the financial resources of the people of the whole country to complete economic self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>2.  Passive control: The general new national goods industries that are already growing have suffered greatly in recent years due to excessive free competition. Now we must use the power of the state to implement production control. According to the current state, we must stipulate the production volume and standard prices of each industry and each factory, and limit the disorderly emergence of new factories, so as to adjust and stabilize the foundation of the current national goods industry.</p>
<p>In short, I firmly believe that to implement national goods control, we must pay close attention to the following: First, we must plan and stipulate production so that the production quantity adapts to the consumption quantity and always maintains a balanced state. Second, we must adjust the flow of national goods products and stipulate market prices to achieve the socialization of distribution. Even for competition among the same industry, we must give reasonable control. Third, we must strive to promote the development of foreign markets and at the same time prevent the dumping of foreign goods in China. Foreign factories within the country should also be sanctioned and banned by the government. In this way, I think the current national goods industry shrouded in darkness will have room to rise!</p>
<h3>Random Jottings from Yi Lu</h3>
<p>— Xu Gan</p>
<p>Before the two words "national goods" were put together to become a noun, I suspected that China didn't produce any goods at all, that it was a completely goods-less country.</p>
<p>That Chinese people have to vigorously promote and urge the use of Chinese goods is truly a rare and comical wonder in the world.</p>
<p>"Promoting national goods" requires designating a "National Goods Year for Women" and a "National Goods Year for Students," making year after year a kind of effective movement; this is also a painstaking method, yet it already causes much astonishment. But if the result of the so-called energetic movement is equivalent to zero, then what else is there to say?</p>
<p>The person selling foreign goods says, "If no one comes to buy, I certainly won't sell them." The person buying foreign goods says, "If no one sells them, I certainly won't buy them." Both are supremely clever answers, but China is ruined by having too many of these clever people.</p>
<p>National goods producers all bitterly resent the national people's ignorance of how to support and cherish them, which prevents national goods manufacturers from competing with foreign merchants. But the general populace resents that national goods manufacturers' products are not as cheap and good as foreign goods, forcing people to purchase foreign goods. Regarding this contradictory situation, I hope both sides can break away from their subjective positions and understand each other.</p>
<p>A fashionable slogan, shouted by those who like to show off for a while, after some time unknowingly turns into stale platitudes. At first, some people might listen to it as a new song, but later, they tire of hearing it, and naturally, those who sing it will also feel less enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Because of the increase in China's trade deficit, money flows out, leading to the daily impoverishment of the national economy and people's livelihoods. But I think there will come a day when impoverishment reaches the point where purchasing power is completely exhausted, and then the trade deficit will definitely decrease, right?</p>
<h3>A Visit to the New China Engineering Company</h3>
<p>— Huang Jian</p>
<p>Xinzhong is located at Yanjiage, Baoxing Road, Zhabei. Before the January 28th Incident, its capital was 250,000. After the Shanghai Incident, Zhabei was almost destroyed. Fortunately, the factory's employees moved out important machinery beforehand, so although the loss of buildings was still small, the capital for post-war reconstruction was only 150,000, speaking of which, one can't help but feel pained!</p>
<p>Following the factory director Wei Rujun's appointment, I arrived at the factory at eight o'clock the next morning. He personally led the tour, first to the assembly room, which contained more than twenty diesel engines that were either completed, completed but not yet painted, or not yet assembled, with power ranging from ten to seventy-five horsepower. He personally tested a completed unit on the spot, and the results were excellent. When asked about fuel consumption, it was only three pounds per hour, no less than foreign goods. However, because the vibration was very strong, it should only be used in places with solid foundations. It is not suitable for portable water pumps.</p>
<p>Next to the workshop was a water pump testing pool, about two zhang square. At that time, a spiral water pump with a 14-inch diameter was being tested, powered by a 16-horsepower electric motor. It could pump 4,500 gallons of water per hour. It is more cost-effective to use it to pump sewage when the ground difference is not significant. It is especially suitable for inland China to use it with a diesel engine with equivalent horsepower. At that time, a huge stream of water rushed out of the pipe, demonstrating the power of science to mankind.</p>
<p>Arriving at the workshop, drilling machines, planing machines, and washing machines were arranged everywhere. At that time, only three or four people were electric welding cylinders, and one person was repairing the water pump casing on a large planer. The factory cared about the hard work of the workers, so it was a day off as usual. The rest was several engines packed and waiting for shipment, some of which were going to Yunnan.</p>
<p>Turning to the sand casting room, there was one sand casting machine and two iron smelting furnaces. The tools were placed in one place. Like the woodworking room, there was no work due to the holiday, so I did not examine it in detail. I only glanced at it from the window and saw that there were many molds inside, all for sand casting parts.</p>
<p>Further ahead was an open space. Wei Jun said, "We are starting to build an automobile engine research room. After it is completed, we will start work and do our best to contribute to the birth of a national automobile engine." Hearing this, I admired him even more. The factory is making arduous struggles under various difficult conditions, and I sincerely hope that my compatriots will encourage each other so that national goods will not be destroyed by foreign forces!</p>
<p>To the south of the factory is a large material assembly area, prepared for connecting iron bridges and water towers. The Jinhua iron bridge on the Hangjiang Road was built by the factory. Its products are widely sold in Jiangsu, Yunnan, Shaanxi and other places. I hope that its output will increase day by day, so as to celebrate the increasingly bright future of national goods.</p>
<h3>Two Points that the National Goods Industry Should Pay Attention To</h3>
<p>— (Zhao Shiduo)</p>
<p>At a time when the voices of advocating national goods to save the country are clamoring across the country, I hope that the general national goods manufacturers can think big and start small in promoting national goods. Because I feel that several manufacturers are too neglecting of small details, too Westernized, and too contradictory. The most obvious is that the boxes and instructions of each national product, etc., sometimes even print two slogans of Chinese people using Chinese goods, but after careful investigation, most of the box paper used is foreign goods. I only cited a few examples, and there are countless others. It seems that they should be reformed. I also hope that the managers of each manufacturer can lead by example and supervise the employees below to use national goods uniformly. Those who wear non-national goods should be given appropriate punishment to emphasize prestige. I think these two points should be reformed and implemented urgently. (Courtesy)</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Old Wine</h3>
<p>— Yi Sun</p>
<p>The large-scale import of foreign wine can't help but remind us of Shaoxing old wine. Now I will write down what I know below:</p>
<p>The reason why Shaoxing wine is mellow can be said to be entirely due to the water. The water used by Shaoxing wineries to brew wine is almost all taken from Jian Lake. This water contains very little salt, phosphoric acid, iron, and other ingredients, and its hardness is only about 2.4, which is very suitable for brewing wine.</p>
<p>The raw materials for brewing wine are glutinous rice, wheat koji, and wine yeast. Glutinous rice is mostly purchased from Wuxi, Danyang and other places. Wine yeast is divided into two types: one is white yeast, which comes from Ningbo; the other is black yeast, which comes from Fuyang. Wheat koji rarely comes from outside the county and is mostly made by local manufacturers.</p>
<p>There are also two methods of brewing wine: one is to spread the rice, and the other is to pour the rice. Because the wine brewed by spreading the rice is more durable, this method is mostly used.</p>
<p>Most wineries are located near Jian Lake, especially concentrated in Ruanshe and Xiguo, with a total of about 1,800. Among them, the most famous are Shen Yonghe, Zhang Dongming, and Wang Youmei. Shen Yonghe invented the use of wine instead of water to brew Shan Niang wine, which tastes quite sweet.</p>
<p>Shaoxing wine sold locally is called Benzhuang; wine sold to other ports is called Luzhuang. Luzhuang wine is mostly transferred to the Pearl River, Yangtze River, and Yellow River basins from Ningbo, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. Some are transported to foreign countries, such as the South Pacific Islands and India, which are also not in the minority.</p>
<p>With a history of two or three thousand years and an annual output of more than 188,000 vats, the scope of Shaoxing wine cannot be considered small; but it can't resist the import of foreign wine. The biggest reason is that the brewers stick to old rules and do not improve. The brewing methods used two thousand years ago are not much different from those currently used. I sincerely hope that the Shaoxing wine industry colleagues will pay attention to this. At the same time, I hope that the government can reduce taxes so that it can compete freely with foreign wine to reverse the outflow of money.</p>
<h3>My Opinion on the Handbook for Promoting National Goods</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Signature handbooks were popular for a while, leaving a fleeting trace to be cherished for future remembrance!</p>
<p>In ancient times, filial sons cherished utensils left behind by their parents, and today, lovers cherish keeping their loved one's handwriting! Recently, those who socialize have seen the trouble of exchanging business cards and their easy scattering and forgetting! So they compete for signature handbooks, including celebrities, important people, movie queens, and campus beauties! It can be said that "there are golden houses in the book" and "there are beautiful women in the book"!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, exquisite and magnificent handbooks are all imported goods! There are very few handbooks made of national goods. With the wide range of users, the leakage should also be considerable!</p>
<p>I think that the national goods handbook is obviously timely to rise. I hope that paper mills such as Jiangnan and Tianzhang will actively plan. For example, use Jiangnan Lian History with white paper and insert national goods newspapers in the middle so that signatures on the front and back pages will not seep through! The cover is pasted with silk produced by the Maya factory, with various colors, which should be very impressive! Slightly reverse the leakage! Don't do it because of small profits!</p>
<p>The reporter further hopes that celebrities, important people, movie stars, campus beauties, and general social figures, if they encounter non-national goods signature handbooks, should not easily write on them. I sincerely pray with 120,000 points of sincerity!</p>

<p>Shen Bao Special Issue Celebrating the Opening of Children's Year</p>
<h3>Opening Speech for Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Today is the opening day of Children's Year, which is really the most memorable day for children. As the editor of Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly, I have a few sincere words to say to the children.</p>
<p>Children should know that most of those who preside over education and set this Children's Year are middle-aged or elderly people; then why don't they have a middle-aged year or an elderly year, but insist on setting up this Children's Year? Well! This is all because they love you children. Children should also love themselves and cherish their motherland even more.</p>
<p>How to love yourselves? It is to get rid of bad habits and practice a new life; obey your parents' orders at home, and listen to your teachers' instructions at school; work hard at all times to increase your knowledge, cultivate your virtues, and strengthen your physique. Be a well-behaved elementary school student now, and be a great person who benefits the country and the people in the future.</p>
<p>How to love your motherland? It is to recognize the relationship between yourself and the motherland and inspire patriotic thoughts; do not think that you are young and give up the work of saving the country. The first step is to promote national goods to save the country: eat national goods candies and pastries, use national goods stationery and toys, and wear national goods clothes, shoes, and hats. Not only should you use national goods yourself, but you should also persuade others to use national goods. Using one more national good is giving the motherland one more point of vitality. The second step is to pay attention to science to save the country: you must know that the wealth and strength of every country in the world rely on the power of science. A country with backward science will not be able to stand in the world in the future. Therefore, you should put all your energy into science. In elementary school, first lay the foundation of science in arithmetic and natural common sense, and then in middle school and university, you can focus on physics, chemistry, and other subjects, and conduct academic research and practical experiments at any time and place. In the future, inventing new things, opening up new resources, benefiting the people, and strengthening national defense are the best ways to save the country.</p>
<p>Children, today is the first day of Children's Year, so please start doing it step by step from today.</p>
<h3>Infant or Old Man?</h3>
<p>— Kang Jianzhai Fu</p>
<p>Modern China can be regarded as a decrepit old man, although he is still struggling to rejuvenate. But he is bound by a special environment that does not allow you to open your eyes and speak.</p>
<p>Modern China can also be regarded as a suckling infant, and some ill-intentioned women are vying to be our nannies. They pull on the fat milk on their chests to force you to feed, wanting you to "be like me! be like me!" and not allow you to walk away and learn.</p>
<p>What do we want to do after all?</p>
<p>We are determined not to be decrepit old men waiting for the arrival of death; we are also determined not to always be suckling infants who are manipulated by others. We should of course be lively, strong, free, and independent promising young people.</p>
<p>Lu Fangweng, a patriotic poet of the Southern Song Dynasty, has a poem: "Since ancient times, heroes have had ups and downs, and crises and changes also linger. It is not difficult to resist the poor bandits of Yinping, but to let such a country be given to others?"</p>
<p>Can we give this beautiful country to foreigners?</p>
<p>No! Even if 400 million people die cleanly, we still can't!</p>
<p>Chinese children! Chinese Children's Year!</p>
<p>Don't be a decrepit old man, dying before your eyes;</p>
<p>Don't be a suckling infant, crying and laughing, pitied by others;</p>
<p>Be a lively, strong, free, and independent promising young person!</p>
<h3>Good Children in Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Yi De</p>
<p>Children! The year starting today is your year, your especially happy year, and your year to enjoy happiness. You see, government offices are open for you, stores are selling at low prices for you, everyone is celebrating for you... the whole society is working hard for you; they are busy for you, and they always say in one sentence that they are all seeking happiness for you.</p>
<p>But have you ever thought about how you should be a good child from today onwards to repay the society's kindness and make the society value you more and hope more from you?</p>
<p>The so-called good child is not a good child who follows the rules, nor is it a good child who studies hard. You should clearly recognize that our country is a country in urgent national crisis, and the world today is a world where the strong prey on the weak. We should cultivate a unique true spirit to be considered a good child.</p>
<p>How can you be considered a good child? I think first, you must have the spirit of self-improvement. We must go through rational judgment. For what is reasonable, we must sincerely support it. For what is unreasonable, we must stand up to confront it. This precious spirit should be cultivated with care at ordinary times. Second, we must have the spirit of sacrifice: to confront, sacrifice is inevitable; to be afraid of sacrifice is not worthy of confrontation. As long as it is beneficial to the public, we must work hard to do it, sacrificing money, sacrificing happiness, and even sacrificing life, it is not a pity. Otherwise, without the spirit of sacrifice, there will be many considerations when doing things, and with many considerations, the goal of success cannot be achieved. The so-called sacrifice must also have a price. If it is only for personal interests, it is not worth taking at all.</p>
<p>Children! These two spirits are what we lack most, but what we need most urgently. Starting today, please cultivate these two true spirits more, and then be the masters of the country in the future. Today's good children are the good masters of the future.</p>
<h3>Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Wei Bingxin</p>
<p>Children's Year, a happy year for children across the country! Family life is full of interest, and schoolwork is fresh every day. Now the status is gradually improving; now the status is gradually improving: I also hope that welfare will be further increased. Children's Year, a happy year for children across the country!</p>
<p>Children's Year, a working year for children across the country!</p>
<p>Superstitions are reformed with effort, and health campaigns are undertaken by each shoulder; social illiteracy must be eradicated, and the world's poverty should be pitied. Children's Year, a working year for children across the country!</p>
<p>Children's Year, a striving year for children across the country!</p>
<p>Seeking knowledge is rich and not self-satisfied, working hard and moving forward. Inspiring ambition should be to learn from the predecessors; how can patriotism allow the former sages? Children's Year, a striving year for children across the country!</p>
<h3>Children's Year and Modern Parents</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>The state-designated Children's Year opens today. But we must remember that it is not over with today's celebration, nor does it mean that during this year, people across the country will pay attention to the education of children, and it will be over after this year. It must be known that from now on, after Children's Year, teachers, especially modern parents, must think about the education of children and the happiness of children every year and every moment. In short: (1) Children's daily life, "clothing," "food," "housing," and "transportation," completely rely on the supply of parents, (2) Children's usual cultivation, "wisdom," "virtue," "physical fitness," "group," and "beauty," especially need the guidance of parents: It can be seen that the responsibility of modern parents is really very important, and they simply cannot relax for a moment, and they cannot ignore anything. Thinking back to the past, did ordinary parents ever pay attention to these issues? History tells us that people like Mr. Zhu Baitang, Zeng Wenzheng Gong, Meng Mu, and Yue Mu can be regarded as the most glorious fatherly and motherly teachings: but ordinary people, whether fathers or mothers, only focus on children's "nurturing" - clothing, food, and warmth - and have not studied the "teaching" - the aspects of virtue, wisdom, and physical fitness. Therefore, we reminisce about the past and think that we have not done our best in family education: Thinking about the future, we must never ignore it any longer; parents after Children's Year, in addition to materially supporting children, must add a layer of spiritual guidance, and the latter is much more important than the former.</p>
<p>In our China, whether in cities or villages, families or schools, there are very few rationalized methods and equipment for children's education that can be used as a standard and are worthy of everyone's imitation. Then we can only give others' facts as a reference. In the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and Russia, which are known as material civilizations, from the government to the common people, have relatively complete facilities for children's problems in their social organizations. Even the wandering orphans (including lonely, disabled, poor, etc. children) are handled in an orderly manner, unlike the wandering children in our country who live an inhuman life in hell all year round, which is worthy of research. But look at the situation in the UK: "The UK is a kingdom of children" a Japanese educator has already said this. Really, all social life in the UK is centered on children. If you go to a bookstore in London, you can see piles of children's books. Generally, people go to bookstores and always buy a few children's books for their children or buy them as gifts for their friends' children. London citizens are very fond of children and respect children's personality. Even in poor families, there will be a children's room, which is a sacred area, and children become true sovereigns. Of course, that is the kingdom of children, and adults must be very respectful and serious when entering the kingdom. Most families in London have a small garden, and there will be no shortage of children's play equipment. Also, because London is always foggy, which hinders the physical development of children, many people want to move to the suburbs to allow children to get as close as possible to the natural world, which is of course a reflection of the psychology of protecting children. The mothers of British children, for the sake of their children becoming the successors of the British nation, do not hesitate to work hard to train their children in the wind, frost, rain and snow, hoping that they can also raise the banner of the British Empire on the icy island of the North Pole. The British government, society, and families are so attentive to creating well-being for children, which really moves us. In reality, it is not easy to imitate them in our country. But according to my opinion, parents hereafter must not give their children abundant food and clothing and develop their bad habits of pampering themselves; arbitrarily indulging them, gradually leading them into the wrong path of pride, luxury, and licentiousness. They must follow the ancient precepts of "filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" and make their children work hard in the five aspects of "virtue," "wisdom," "physical fitness," "group," and "beauty," hoping that the future masters will transform the declining China!</p>

<h3>Mr. Science Performs Magic Tricks</h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>——Burning Characters and Paintings on White Paper——</p>
<p>"Children's Year has opened!" Mr. Science also came to participate in the celebration. Look! He's on stage. He and his assistant are carrying two very large white paper circles onto the stage.</p>
<p>At this time, two chairs were placed in the center of the stage, and they placed these two white paper circles on the backs of the chairs.</p>
<p>"Hello everyone," Mr. Science said after bowing to the audience, "Today is the opening day of Children's Year. I hope that all the children in China, with the help of society and through their own efforts, will create a new child - a new child with a strong body, a scientific mind, and hands that can work. Today, in my magic trick, I will also express a little bit of celebration and encouragement."</p>
<p>After he said that, he called his assistant to take two incense sticks from behind the scenes, lit them with fire, and each held one. Then he continued:</p>
<p>Sure enough, Mr. Science and his assistant lit the top end of the paper with incense, and the paper burned. What was even more surprising was that the fire would move meanderingly on the paper. Before long, a character "Celebrate" appeared, and then a character "Celebrate" appeared. In a short while, the five characters "Celebrate Children's Year" were completely displayed in front of the children.</p>
<p>On another white paper circle, what first appeared seemed to be the top of a person's head. Later, eyebrows appeared, and then eyes, ears, nose, and mouth appeared one after another. It turned out to be a half-length portrait of a smiling child!</p>
<p>The children in the audience watched with interest and applauded continuously.</p>
<p>"Children, do you think this set of magic tricks is interesting? Would you like to try it? It is very suitable to perform this set of magic tricks when schools or families hold celebrations or commemorations. The materials only need three things: (1) a solution of potassium nitrate (available at pharmacies) (it should be a little thicker), (2) thicker white paper, and (3) a fountain pen.</p>
<p>"Once the materials are prepared, use the fountain pen to dip in the solution, write characters or draw pictures on the white paper, and dry it in the shade. The white paper will not show any traces. However, you must make a mark in advance at the starting point to avoid not knowing where to start when performing.</p>
<p>"When performing, use the burning incense to light the paper from the marked place. When you touch a place where the strokes are disconnected, use the incense to light it again. Therefore, the incense should always be held in your hand. - It is best to draw it from beginning to end with one stroke, without any gaps in the middle, so that it can be burned from beginning to end without having to use incense to light it again."</p>
<h3>Children's Year and Aviation</h3>
<p>— Yunhua</p>
<p>Children's Year! Children's Year! It is our year of happiness, and also our year of hard work! As Ci'er was clapping and singing this song, he suddenly heard a rattling sound in the sky. Looking up, he saw airplanes scattering colorful leaflets celebrating Children's Year. He jumped for joy, his heart filled with indescribable delight. It happened that his teacher, Mr. Li, saw him and called out, "Wang Ci! Why are you so happy?" "Oh, Teacher! I saw the airplanes scattering leaflets to celebrate Children's Year for us children, so I'm especially happy." "That's good. We'll hold an opening ceremony for Children's Year in a little while, and I want you to tell a story about aviation for everyone to hear." Ci'er thought to himself, this is a bit difficult, but how could he disobey the teacher's orders? So he pondered for a long time.</p>
<p>The celebration was very lively, with the principal giving an opening speech, guest speakers, and various performances of songs, dances, music, and sports by students of all grades. Finally, there was a children's speech segment, and Mr. Li introduced Wang Ci to tell a story about aviation. The whole place erupted in applause. Wang Ci walked onto the stage from the crowd, his manner very solemn. He gave a ninety-degree bow and said calmly:</p>
<p>"Principal, teachers, classmates, today is the opening of Children's Year. It may seem irrelevant to speak about aviation instead of children themselves, so please forgive me! Our country's aviation industry is very young and backward. It seems there aren't many stories to tell. I'd like to report on two international aviation news items that perhaps some of you haven't noticed. (1) There is a clever carpenter in France named Mignet who spent many years creating an ingenious airplane. Its structure is simple, and after completion, it was named the "Flying Flea." It is estimated that as many as 10,000 of these can be built in a year, and the French are now widely promoting the functions of the "Flying Flea." (2) Italy and Abyssinia have been preparing for war for a long time, and a bloody battle may be inevitable. Recently, the Italian Air Force has been deployed. Premier Mussolini's sons, aged nineteen and seventeen, have volunteered to join the army and die for their country. The Premier praised them greatly and allowed the two brothers to be the vanguard in the campaign against Abyssinia. Although we do not sympathize with this act of bullying the weak, their youthful ambition and courageous patriotism can serve as a model for us!</p>
<p>Fellow students! In our ranks, I don't believe that there won't be people like the French carpenter and the Italian Premier's sons in the future. If there really aren't, then we are all sinners of the Republic of China!"</p>
<p>Before Wang Ci finished speaking, the applause under the stage was thunderous, and everyone gave him a solemn salute.</p>
<p>Children's Book Bureau's Commemorative Publication for Children's Year</p>
<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Children—this is a lovely, innocent, and hopeful noun full of comfort. But since the beginning of history, they have been oppressed and despised by adults, who thought of them as just "miniature adults" who only know how to eat and enjoy themselves, and don't know how to live independently. It wasn't until the twentieth century that adults realized and changed their previous erroneous concepts of oppressing and despising children to loving and respecting children: knowing that children are important new members of society, not simply miniature adults; and although they cannot directly participate in various social activities now, when their physical and mental development reaches a certain stage, they will also be key players in social activities. This is truly the most fortunate thing in human history.</p>
<p>This year is the nationally designated Children's Year, and it also marks the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Children's Book Bureau. Therefore, from now on, we dare to sincerely follow the parents, teachers, and members of society who care for children, recognizing and guiding them every day, hoping for children, and providing them with the necessary new knowledge, so that children across the country have: healthy bodies, creative abilities, and a spirit of service to society; so that all children in the country become new strengths. This is also a bit of what we mean by publishing.</p>
<p>However, the Children's Book Bureau is like a five-year-old child, and its capabilities are still very weak. We hope that educators at home and abroad will provide guidance and support in all our endeavors!</p>

<p>Everyone, let's celebrate the New Year! Everyone, let's celebrate the New Year! What kind of New Year are we celebrating? Children's Year. Don't be happy yet. Think about which children can't celebrate the New Year? The homeless children can't celebrate the New Year. No food to eat, no clothes to wear, no work to do, no books to read. Crack! That's the police officer's whip. Only when these children can celebrate the New Year can it be considered a happy Children's Year.</p>

Think about which children can't celebrate the New Year? The wet nurse's children can't celebrate the New Year. No milk to drink, don't know what sugar tastes like. You're as fat as a winter melon, they're pitifully thin. Tracing the source, it's only because they're short a few pennies. Only when these children can celebrate the New Year can it be considered a happy Children's Year.</p>

<h3>Five Major Problems in Children's Literature</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>—Editing, Selection, Utilization, Guidance, Examination—</p>
<p>Children's literature is the food for children's knowledge. Without food, they will starve! Without suitable food, they will also get sick...</p>
<p>To make children's literature a suitable food for children's knowledge, and one that can be easily digested, we need to solve five problems, namely "the editing and writing of children's literature," "the selection of children's literature," "the utilization of children's literature," "the guidance of children's reading," and "the examination of children's reading."</p>
<p>The editing and writing of children's literature is the most important issue in the study of children's literature. Whether it is the selection of materials, the organization of words, or the composition of the style, everything is sufficient to affect the overall function of the literature. -- How to compile and write literature that is completely suitable for children? This, we should expect from authors and bookstores.</p>
<p>The selection of children's literature arises because the first problem of editing and writing is not fully resolved, and also because in addition to the editing and writing of content, there are various problems such as paper, font, printing, and binding, which may not fully meet our ideals, so when purchasing children's literature, we still need to go through a selection process. -- How to select literature that is completely suitable for children? This, we should expect from schools, families, and bookstores that have the responsibility to publish.</p>
<p>The utilization of children's literature is also an important issue in children's literature. Because children's literature is a kind of tool in education, to make this tool perform its function, there must be a corresponding method of utilization, just like a sharp weapon, in the weapon itself, there is a great function. But to make this weapon show its great function, the first thing is to understand the method of using it, otherwise the weapon itself is simply a dead thing, and it will never exert its great function on its own. -- How to use children's literature? This, we should expect from teachers and parents who have the responsibility to guide children.</p>
<p>The guidance of children's reading is an important issue in increasing the effectiveness of children's reading. The so-called guidance is certainly not teaching word by word, or explaining sentence by sentence, as long as you give detailed instructions on the method of reading, and give a general overview of the content of the literature, so that children will not be at a loss. -- How to give children reasonable guidance? This, we should again expect from responsible teachers and parents.</p>
<p>The examination of children's reading is the final step in diagnosing efficiency. In education, whatever kind of facility is used, what is sought is efficiency: guiding children's reading is a kind of facility in education, and after we implement it, we should of course diagnose it, on the one hand to assess children's reading ability, and on the other hand to measure whether our own guidance methods are appropriate, as a basis for future improvement. -- How to give children a reasonable examination? This, we should again expect from responsible teachers and parents.</p>
<p>In short, to improve children's literature to increase the effectiveness of children's reading, we should work together from all aspects to achieve success.</p>

<h3>Speaking of Parent Education from Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Liang Shijie</p>
<p>Children are the most lovely and respectable. Their future accomplishments are far greater and more promising than those of any adult. This year, from August 1st to July 31st of next year, is the nationally designated Children's Year. This is what the country means by respecting and hoping for children.</p>
<p>If we respect and hope for children, we must give them a good education. However, a child's lifelong character and temperament are mostly influenced by their parents from a young age. John B. Watson once said: "After observing hundreds of babies, we believe that a person's future model has been formed by the time they are two years old. ... Whether a child will have a noble character in the future? Will they be weak? Will they have many fears? Will they have a violent temper? Will they be emotional or lacking in emotion? ... These questions are already decided in the second year after birth." From this passage, we can know that to respect and hope for children, we should first pay attention to parent education.</p>
<p>The United States is an advanced country, and they spare no effort in promoting parent education. They have: (1) Preparatory parent education -- including "Parent Education" in the curriculum of primary, secondary, universities, and remedial schools, so that unmarried young men and women receive "Parent Education" training: (2) Remedial parent education -- in public and private educational, charitable, religious, academic, and other organizations and institutions throughout the country, organize parent education and child education research associations, or set up parent education training classes, or send people to visit families to investigate the state of child education, or compile and print small booklets on child education to promote it. Looking back at the negligence of "parent education" in China, people can't help but feel dumbfounded. Spencer said: "The survival, death, success, and failure of children all depend on the upbringing of their parents. But the existing education does not mention a word about the parents of children and the methods of child education. Isn't this a strange thing? They completely entrust the fate of children's lives to blind customs and emotional impulses, and then add the opinions of stupid wet nurses or stubborn grandmothers. Isn't this an absurd thing?" These words are aimed at the shortcomings of traditional Chinese family education. May children's welfare organizations and academic groups across the country take advantage of the opportunity of this Children's Year to launch large-scale advocacy and promotion of "parent education"; and hope that parents will study the methods of child rearing!</p>
<h3>Today's Children's Literature</h3>
<p>— Chen Bochui</p>
<p>The significance of "Children's Year": directly speaking, to increase children's happiness and health; indirectly speaking, to strengthen the driving force for national revival. But how to complete this major meaning? Simply put, only through children's education!</p>
<p>Children's education is multifaceted, but from the perspective of my editorial position, it is like this:</p>
<p>John Dewey said "Education is Life". Based on this educational principle, we should publish more books about children's lives; children's curiosity and thirst for knowledge are particularly developed, they require enriching experiences and understanding things, and they have a great need for natural stories, animal stories, life stories, etc., and we should find ways to satisfy them.</p>
<p>Educators and psychologists all agree "Learning by doing". In this area of publication, the Children's Book Bureau has done the best, the 101-volume Children's Science Series are all some of the simplest science tricks, a kind of interesting little experiment, if possible, we should publish more. But how should parents at home and teachers at school help children learn on their own!</p>
<p>The world of the future is a world of science. The times of theology and metaphysics are over! Children of the 20th century should be scientific children, so their reading materials should not violate natural phenomena; and should enable them to understand natural phenomena and forces, and then teach them how to conquer nature. The Children's Book Bureau, bearing the children's cultural and educational undertakings, its publishing policy is aimed at this direction, so the Elementary Common Sense Series, Children's Loose-Leaf Common Sense, Our Central Activities and other series, are published following the Children's Science Series.</p>
<p>Aristotle said: "Man is a political animal." That's right, as soon as a baby is born, they are protected by law and have a place in society. So today's children are not only little fools filled with scientific knowledge, they must have a bit of social knowledge in their minds, so as not to use knowledge to harm people. In this regard, the Children's Book Bureau has also published the Children's Social Series, the Children's New History and Geography Series, the National Defense Hero Series, and Chinese Celebrities</p>
<p>Due to limited space, I cannot speak freely, please give readers your advice!</p>
<h3>A Word to Children on Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Ma Jingxuan</p>
<p>——Study hard</p>
<p>Children's Year has opened! This year is entirely yours, children! You see: children's protection associations have been organized all over the country to study methods of child rearing and protection; newspapers and magazines are publishing children's weeklies or children's research papers; organizations, groups, and families are all seeking happiness for children and want to do something for children in Children's Year. However, children are the masters of the country and have the responsibility to save the country. I want to say a word to children: from now on, you should "study hard"! Because studying hard is saving the country.</p>
<p>The Children's Book Bureau is a bookstore that provides good reading materials for children. In the past five years, it has published about eight or nine hundred kinds of children's reading materials. This year is Children's Year, and the Children's Book Bureau will naturally also do something, so it has divided into three groups for kindergartens, primary schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools, and compiled three sets of series: namely the Elementary Children's Common Sense Series, Our Central Activities, and the Children's Half-Angle Series. These three sets of series and the eight or nine hundred kinds of children's reading materials published previously are all edited by children's education experts and recognized by educators across the country as good children's reading materials.</p>
<p>I hope that children will automatically study hard and automatically choose good books to read: gain good knowledge from good reading materials, and grow up to take on the work of saving the country, so that the country can change from weak to strong.</p>
<p>"Little friends, these two white paper circles don't have any traces on them, do they? But you watch: after we light them with incense, words and pictures will appear on them."</p>
<p>The little friends under the stage heard that words and pictures would appear on the white paper circles once they were lit with incense, and they found it very interesting, so they all perked up and watched.</p>
<h3>Timely Children's Science</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Today is the opening day of Children's Year. Celebrations are being held everywhere, lectures on children's issues are being given everywhere, and children's programs are being broadcast everywhere. Taking advantage of this occasion to study the problem of "sound" in science is definitely not without significance.</p>
<p>Before talking about the principles, we can do a few small experiments to play with. In the experiments, we may understand what sound is. You stand by the edge of a pool or a water tank and use your hand to slap up a few water waves. These water waves will gradually move forward, but when these water waves hit the edge of the tank or the pool, the water waves will immediately return (Figure 1). We can understand that the success of sound is that the air generates waves due to our sound or vibration, just like you use your hand to slap the water. Therefore, the progress of sound is similar to water waves. Therefore, some lecture stages have sounding boards installed above or behind them, which use this effect to make the speaker's sound waves. When the sound waves reach the sounding board, the sound waves will be reflected down and reach the eardrums of the audience, and it will be louder. Some use report microphones to report everything spoken in a large venue (Figure 2). The principle is the same as what I said above. The sound waves hit the edge of the microphone, are reflected down, and mix with the original sound waves, making the sound waves louder and transmitted to the eardrums of the audience.</p>
<p>The situation of sound wave progress has been said above. However, in addition to air, solid things can also transmit sound waves, and they are faster than air. Have you played with a telephone made of matchboxes? (Figure 3) Glue paper to one end of the matchbox, thread a thin wire through it, make two of the same, and you can use them to make a phone call. But you should pay attention, the wire must be pulled tight, otherwise the wire will swing in the air, hindering the progress of the sound waves, and the words will not be heard clearly.</p>
<p>We can also play another experiment. You cover your ears with your hands, teach another person to wrap your head and hands with a hemp rope, and then teach him to hold the two ends of the rope with one hand and pull it tightly, and rub the rope lightly with the fingers of the other hand (Figure 4), then you will hear a very loud sound wave ringing, like thunder. This experiment also proves the example of solid sound transmission.</p>
<p>After a few experiments, we can always understand that sound is a wave formed by air oscillation, its progress is the same as water waves, and solid sound transmission is faster, and when several sound waves combine, it will be louder.</p>
<p>— Wu Bixi, age eleven</p>
<p>On behalf of the children of the country I thank the authorities for promoting the special kindness of the Children's Year I beg the authorities on behalf of the children of the country who are out of school to implement universal education as soon as possible so that all children have the opportunity to go to school.</p>

<p>Children's Year Opening Special Issue</p>
<h3>Spiritual Construction in Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>Today, those who seek the blessings of children are all committed to the construction of material undertakings. In China, where children's undertakings are very weak, this is indeed an effort that we should make. However, the so-called construction of children's undertakings cannot be done by relying on the advocacy of a few people. It must be that the whole country, from top to bottom, has the concept of loving children, and everyone regards loving children as a duty that should be fulfilled, and only through cooperation can we achieve success. Although the children's cause in our country has been advocated for many years, there has been no progress to date, because the people of the country have a weak concept of loving children, fail to regard loving children as a duty to be fulfilled, and fail to fulfill the responsibility of supporting children's undertakings. Therefore, if we want to improve the happiness of children today, in addition to material construction, we should first seek the completion of spiritual construction.</p>
<p>The so-called spiritual construction, in a word, is to promote the concept of loving children among the people of the country. From now on, the government should regard loving children as one of the main governing policies of the country, and regard developing children's undertakings as the top priority of the country. Although the national treasury is empty, special funds should be allocated for loving children. The more difficult the national crisis, the more loving children cannot be abandoned. As for the people, they should know the importance of the status of children and their relationship with the country and the nation, and regard loving children as a natural duty that should be fulfilled by the people. Those with strength should contribute their strength, and those with money should contribute their money. In addition to caring for their own children, they should also care for general children, and "love my young, and extend it to the young of others" should be regarded as a guiding principle. Only then can the meaning of spiritual construction be completed.</p>
<p>After the completion of spiritual construction, the government advocates in the front, and the people support in the back. The construction of material undertakings will be promising. Today is the opening day of the nationally designated Children's Year, and it is the beginning of spiritual construction! I look forward to it!</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>In ancient China, governance and education were combined: nurturing the young and caring for the elderly. This has always been valued. It is true that children have the innate qualities of quick wit and wisdom, pure goodness, and lively nature; their intelligence, virtue, and physical fitness are all above those of adults. If we can teach and nurture them, each in its own way, it will be easy to cultivate them into talents for society and improve the quality of the nation.</p>
<p>In recent times, the trend of political reform in various countries has paid great attention to the protection of people's lives; and children's lives and children's rights are even guaranteed by the constitution. This is evident in the new constitution of Germany after the war. Article 122 of the German Constitution stipulates: "Overwork of children, as well as moral, spiritual, and physical neglect, shall be protected. The Federation, the States, and public organizations shall take the necessary measures for this." Secondly, Articles 119 and 120 also have provisions regarding family hygiene and compulsory education. As for the labor codes of various countries, the protection of children is even more comprehensive, such as working age, working hours, education level, and physical health, all of which are strictly and specially restricted and cared for by law.</p>
<p>Our country's sages did not neglect the issue of children at the beginning. As it is said, "Men have their duties, women have their homes, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, disabled, and sick are all cared for," and "Men have their duties, women have their homes, the strong are employed, and love my young, and extend it to the young of others." Their spirit of caring for and paying attention to children can be imagined. It is a pity that in recent times, education has been neglected, and not only the state and society have neglected children; even parents and elders do not know their responsibility for education and upbringing. They live together all day long, and their words do not touch on righteousness: their behavior is dissolute, and their minds and bodies deteriorate day by day. Children are the future spirit of the nation and the cornerstone of the country. If this continues without attention, the harm it will cause to the nation and the country is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Now, on the opening day of the National Children's Year, I would like to briefly express my feelings during my spare time. I deeply hope that those who are engaged in the children's movement today will pay close attention to and study children's psychology, children's education, children's thoughts, children's habits, children's morality, children's bodies, children's lives, children's hygiene, and children's welfare, so that countless lively, pure, and intelligent children will not be corrupted by bad environments, but will be cultivated into talents for the country and society. Then their contribution to the future of our nation will be immeasurable!</p>
<h3>Notice to All Children in the City</h3>
<p>— Shanghai Children's Year Implementation Committee</p>
<p>Adorable children of the whole city!</p>
<p>Today is the opening day of the National Children's Year. Our committee, bearing the responsibility of implementing the Children's Year in this city, naturally wants to take this opportunity to say a few words to all the children in the city.</p>
<p>Our China has designated April 4th as Children's Day, and from today until July of next year, it is also designated as Children's Year. The central government advocates from above, and various provinces and cities promote from below. Such emphasis on children is such a memorable thing. Especially on this opening day of Children's Year, which is the beginning of the implementation of the year's work, everyone should celebrate the arrival of children's welfare with joy and excitement.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Children's Year was initiated by the China Child Welfare Association in this city, and the implementation measures for the Children's Year were also drafted by the Children's Welfare Committee in this city? It can be seen that this city has a special significance for the Children's Year.</p>
<p>"Children are the foundation of the nation, the inheritors of society, and the pillars of the country." Everyone knows these words, and everyone can say them. Children's position in the nation, their position in society, and their position in the country are of great importance. At the same time, the children's future responsibility to the nation, their responsibility to society, and their responsibility to the country are equally important!</p>
<p>We believe that children in cities, because of the easy access to educational opportunities, the influence of material civilization, and the great power of environmental change, their inherent knowledge is often superior to that of ordinary rural children in the inland. Shanghai is the area where culture of our country converges, and it is one of the six major commercial ports in the world. The total population of the city reaches 3,533,597 (according to the statistics of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in June of this year). Furthermore, considering the number of school-age children in the city (special zone to be investigated), which reaches 110,675 (according to the survey conducted by the Municipal Education Bureau in the 22nd year of the Republic of China), it is estimated that the total number of children in the city is probably no less than 800,000, a number that exceeds any other city in the country. In this vast society that contains so many children, we hope that all the children in Shanghai will work hard to make progress and become the leaders of children in all provinces and cities across the country in the future!</p>
<p>Children: are not the private property of the family; they are a part of the society, the nation, and the country. The children of today are the part of the society, nation, and country that will bear responsibility in the future. Therefore, how much attention should families and society pay to the protection and education of children, so that they can take on the responsibility of inheriting the past and opening up the future.</p>
<p>We, the members of this committee, are not talented, but since we bear the responsibility of implementing the Children's Year, we have to do our best diligently. We have drafted an implementation plan, the main points of which are: (1) urging society to pay attention to children's issues; (2) promoting children's welfare undertakings; (3) improving children's education; (4) striving for the relief of abandoned children, illegitimate children, and children with disabilities. At the same time, promoting the general awareness of children about their own position and understanding the difficulties of our country's future. However, this significant responsibility cannot be undertaken by a few people, so we have to hope that all citizens will work together to help achieve this great mission.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the China Child Welfare Association</h3>
<p>Today is the official opening day of Children's Year. On the national level, under the leadership of Chairman Lin, there are enthusiastic and grand celebrations in various places. On the Shanghai level, under the leadership of Mayor Wu, the city has excellent and magnificent performances. Adults are certainly watching children, expressing sincere care, and all the children are celebrating their second birthday with joy. This is truly a unique phenomenon since the establishment of the Republic of China, a moment worthy of special mention in Chinese history. Recalling that on March 7th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, our association requested the establishment of a Children's Day system, and on November 15th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, we requested the establishment of a Children's Year system. Under the circumstances of frequent incidents and numerous urgent matters, the two requests made by our association were adopted and promulgated by the government. This is truly something that fills our country with gratitude and excitement. Under the leadership and promotion of the wise government, coupled with the efforts and struggles of the people of the whole country, we believe that the happiness of Chinese children is boundless, and the development of the Chinese nation is even more boundless. The current depressed situation certainly makes our hearts ache; but when we see the emerging generation about to rise up, following our bloodstained footsteps to march towards the battle line for the survival of the nation, we cannot help but feel infinite comfort and infinite hope. How strictly communist-led Russia is training their Young Pioneers, how seriously fascist-led Italy is training their Boy Scout groups, how diligently the National Socialist Party-led Germany is training their youth groups, and how hard other countries such as England, America, France, and Japan are working to educate their children. We advocate that the motherland led by the Kuomintang should also use the same strictness, seriousness, diligence, and effort to train and educate our children. This is the great way to save the country, and it is also the basic work of cultivating great citizens. We believe that our compatriots across the country will agree with this. The government's outline of the National Children's Year implementation measures, which should be carried out during Children's Year, already contains very detailed instructions. Our association should follow the people of the country and hope to promote its thorough realization. The opening day of Children's Year is the day when children's welfare undertakings begin; but children's welfare undertakings are endless and will never end with the expiration of Children's Year. Therefore, we believe that the entire nation should bear the responsibility for children's welfare undertakings forever. The "education" and "nurturing" of children should be the full responsibility of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior. As for how to contact and coordinate with children's welfare organizations, academic research institutions, medical and health institutions, and people who sympathize with children's welfare undertakings across the country, following the government to work hard to complete the construction of children's welfare, this responsibility seems to be our association's inescapable duty. In today's transitional era, our association is aware of the great responsibility it bears and will certainly strive forward diligently; but because the responsibility is heavy and the road is long, and the task is difficult, we hope that the people of the country will provide the most severe supervision, the most candid instructions, and the most effective assistance at any time!</p>

<h3>Respectfully Informing Agencies Handling Disaster Relief Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, the weather in the Yangtze River basin has cleared up, and the water levels in various ports have decreased. The disaster-stricken areas can begin to provide relief, and the flood control areas have passed the critical period. Although the countryside has been destroyed, the cities have been preserved. Although it can be said that the will of heaven can be turned, it is ultimately due to human efforts. However, given the wide scope of the disaster, affecting almost both sides of the Yangtze River, and the large number of people affected, no less than hundreds of thousands of households, with wailing sounds spreading across the fields, and urgent relief needed! Therefore, the future policy should focus on relief in the short term and dredging in the long term, and the country relies on telecommunications to transmit the news of this policy.</p>
<p>In order to support disaster relief, the Ministry of Transportation has stipulated a type of disaster relief telegram that is transmitted free of charge. The definition of this telegram is summarized in the Disaster Relief Telegram Regulations, which applies to temporary or special urgent relief efforts handled by the National Government or Chinese and foreign relief organizations approved by the governments of various provinces. It does not apply to ordinary relief efforts of a permanent nature or telegrams sent by local charities and private relief organizations.</p>
<p>Relief agencies that wish to send this type of telegram must pay attention to the following points: (A) When applying for a license, they should first submit the following information to the Ministry of Transportation: (1) the name and address of the relief organization, (2) the name and occupation of the representative, (3) the agency that approved the establishment and the date of establishment, (4) the disaster-stricken location and its area, (5) the situation of the disaster area, (6) the purpose and method of the relief effort, (7) the estimated duration of the relief effort, (8) the place name of where the telegrams will be sent from, (9) the number of licenses requested. After being approved by the Ministry of Transportation, the license can be issued. (B) The effective period of the license is determined by the Ministry of Transportation and is limited to three or six months from the date of approval. If an extension is necessary due to the severity of the disaster, an application should be submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for approval to issue another license. However, this extension shall not exceed six months. If the relief effort has been completed, regardless of whether the license has expired, it should be immediately reported to the Ministry for cancellation. (C) The text of the disaster relief telegram is limited to the following urgent matters and must not be mixed with other matters: (1) matters concerning reporting the critical situation in the disaster area, (2) matters relating to the procurement of urgent relief supplies and their transportation, (3) matters concerning fundraising and urging the allocation of relief funds, (4) other urgent matters related to relief. The telegram should also be as concise as possible, limited to Chinese or English clear text. Each Chinese telegram must not exceed one hundred characters, and each English telegram must not exceed fifty characters.</p>
<p>The above is a general outline of the Disaster Relief Telegram Regulations. It is noted that disaster relief telegrams in other countries are not transmitted free of charge and are treated the same as ordinary commercial telegrams. Therefore, there are no restrictions on the provisions of disaster relief telegrams. Natural disasters are prevalent in our country, and relief is needed every year. Therefore, the Disaster Relief Telegram Regulations are promulgated for compliance. The purpose is to prevent agencies sending this type of telegram from abusing it, thus improving the efficiency of transmission, and to prevent the lines transmitting this type of telegram from becoming congested, thus increasing the difficulty of telegram service. It is hoped that relief agencies will strictly adhere to the scope and that all telegraph offices will be willing to receive and will never refuse to send disaster relief telegrams. If they disregard everything and send them indiscriminately, exceeding the capacity of the lines of each office, making it impossible to transmit them, it may be difficult to maintain the implementation of these regulations.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications and Transportation Amidst the Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>In the past two months, floods have occurred in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins, and low-lying counties and cities have been turned into wetlands. The severity of the damage can be described as unprecedented. The sacrifice of people's lives and property is in the millions, which is truly a great misfortune for the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>Among the state-owned enterprises, the most affected by the flood disaster are telecommunications and transportation. The telecommunications and transportation equipment in inland provinces in our country mostly use land lines, followed by wireless communications. The telegraph offices in the disaster-stricken counties and cities along the Yangtze River and Yellow River were either washed away, or the poles and lines were broken, or the poles were submerged in water, causing severe leakage and preventing the transmission of telegrams, which greatly threatened domestic telecommunications and transportation. Fortunately, the transportation authorities made every effort to maintain and properly manage the situation, and communication and transportation in various places were maintained without interruption, or were restored shortly after being interrupted. The process is described as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation has four approaches to deal with telegraph poles and lines washed away by floods: (1) dispatching workers for emergency repairs. Whenever telegraph poles are broken due to strong winds, rain, or water flow, a large number of linemen are dispatched to risk their lives for emergency repairs. Even in flooded areas, they must find ways to support the poles in order to restore communication; (2) constructing temporary lines to bypass and reconnect the communication to maintain communications. For example, the water level in the vicinity of Hanyang and Shashi in Hubei Province is very high, and almost all of the original poles and lines are submerged in water, making repairs impossible for the time being. However, the telecommunications and transportation between Sichuan and Hubei are extremely important, so they had to find ways to bypass the disaster-stricken area and construct temporary telegraph lines in order to reconnect the original lines and restore communication; (3) scheduling lines to maintain communication. For example, the direct lines between Shanghai and Hankou and between Beijing and Hankou were interrupted by water several times, so they found ways to use the lines from Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Zhengzhou to Hankou to maintain communication between Shanghai and Hankou and between Beijing and Hankou without stopping work due to the interruption of the original lines. This is the most economical and effective method; (4) increasing wireless telegraph machines and working hours. For example, the Shanghai-Hankou line was once interrupted because the lines between Zhengzhou and Hankou were washed away by water at the same time, so there was no way to travel by wire. Therefore, they had to increase the number of wireless machines, with Shanghai and Hankou working day and night on dual machines to avoid the backlog of telegrams. In other places where wired telecommunications could not be maintained due to the floods, the daily working hours were also increased to clear telegrams. In addition, the land line between Hankou and Chongqing was interrupted between Shashi and Yichang, and there was no hope of repair for the time being. In addition to the Hankou-Chongqing dual-machine wireless communication, the Nanjing and Wanxian radio stations were also ordered to communicate day and night, and a portion of the telegrams between the downstream of the Yangtze River and Sichuan Province was transmitted via the Beijing-Wanxian route. The land line was still used to the west of Wanxian (because the dual machines of the Hankou-Chongqing wireless line could not handle the huge amount of telegrams). In this way, the telegrams from Nanjing to Chongqing could still be transmitted via two routes, one via the Beijing-Hankou and Hankou-Chongqing wireless lines, and the other via the Beijing-Wanxian wireless line and the Wanxian-Chongqing land line, so that the telegram service would not be severely delayed.</p>
<p>The significance of the Ministry of Transportation's efforts to maintain telecommunications and transportation in the disaster area is very significant. Those who benefit from it are not only the convenience of flood control and disaster relief communications, but also the telegrams of merchants who have stopped purchasing and transporting goods due to the flood disaster, as well as the communications of condolences and reporting disaster situations, which can be transmitted quickly, so they do not suffer from the inability to communicate. Moreover, the military suppression of bandits in Sichuan Province has been tense recently, and the communication between the central government and the military authorities is extremely important. In the midst of this flood disaster, the ability to maintain telecommunications and transportation, so as not to hinder the progress of the military suppression of bandits, is even more gratifying.</p>
<h3>Talking About "Special Delivery Telegrams"</h3>
<p>— Zhongming</p>
<p>...Please pay attention to the sender and receiver...</p>
<p>If the place where the sender sends the telegram, although there is a telegraph office or radio station, is far away from the location of the receiver, then this telegram must be delivered to the receiver by a special messenger hired by the receiving office. This type of telegram is a special delivery telegram. This telegram is marked with the fee identification of "Special Delivery" or "Express". When delivering the telegram, the receiving office must collect the special delivery fee from the receiver in accordance with the special delivery charter established by the Ministry of Transportation. If the sender is willing to pay the special delivery fee for the receiver in advance, they can use "(Special Payment...or XP...)" as the fee identification, and the dotted lines in the parentheses represent the silver dollars for domestic telegrams or the francs for international telegrams. As for the small amount of special delivery fee collected, the regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>No special delivery fee is charged if the receiver's address and the telegraph office or radio station (hereinafter referred to as the office) are within the same city. No special delivery fee is charged if they are not in the same city but are within five li from the office. From five li to ten li, the fee is 15 cents. From ten li to fifty li, the fee is increased by 15 cents for every ten li. Beyond fifty li, the fee is increased by 20 cents for every ten li. For example, for sixty li, the fee should be 95 cents, and so on. Beyond ten li, the remainder less than ten li is also calculated as ten li. The above regulations for collecting special delivery fees are intended to provide a basis for the office and to make it easier for the receiver to check. As for the reason why the office wants to collect a special delivery fee from the receiver for delivering a special delivery telegram, it is very simple, because the number of messengers hired by the office is fixed, and their main task is to deliver general telegrams. If this type of special delivery telegram is also delivered by the office messenger, it will inevitably delay other telegrams due to the long distance and time-consuming round trip. Also, if the office bears this special delivery fee, it is very unreasonable because the telegram fee is often smaller than the special delivery fee, and the office will have to pay a lot of compensation. Therefore, the special delivery fee for special delivery telegrams must be paid by the receiver or sender, as stipulated in the international telegram business regulations.</p>
<p>As for the convenience that the office can provide to the public on special delivery telegrams, it is to regulate the special delivery fee, prevent the messenger from demanding extra money, and thus increase the burden on the receiver. It is also stipulated that all special delivery telegrams delivered to the same receiver at the same time will be charged as one delivery, regardless of the number of telegrams. The Ministry of Transportation has seen this and specially made a special delivery envelope and a special delivery fee receipt, and all offices must use this special envelope when delivering special delivery telegrams, and must fill in the special delivery fee amount in the special delivery fee receipt and hand it over to the special messenger to deliver to the receiver as proof. If this envelope and receipt are used up or have not been sent, the ordinary envelope can be used for delivery, but the office must issue a formal special delivery fee receipt separately to collect the special delivery fee from the receiver to show caution.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely hope that the receiver will pay attention to the following four points when receiving a special delivery telegram and paying the special delivery fee:</p>
<p>(1) Be sure to ask the special messenger for a special delivery fee receipt before paying the special delivery fee;</p>
<p>(2) Whether there is (XP...) in the telegram bottom;</p>
<p>(3) Whether the special delivery fee receipt issued is consistent with the stipulated amount and distance;</p>
<p>(4) Whether the special delivery fee receipt is stamped with the office seal and signed or stamped by the handler.</p>
<p>If the receiver has any questions about this receipt, they can send a detailed account of the matter, along with the receipt, directly to the Telegraph Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing for verification. The Telegraph Administration Department will definitely verify and handle it strictly and give a satisfactory reply upon receiving this letter of request.</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Ministry of Transportation's Crackdown on Privately Established Radio Stations</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Recently, major daily newspapers have often carried advertisements from the "Ministry of Transportation offering rewards for reporting privately established radio stations," which has caught our eye. What is the nature of privately established radio stations? What is the reason for the crackdown? The general reader does not seem to have paid close attention to this or have a correct understanding of it. The reporter is not talented and would like to use the pages of this publication to elaborate on it.</p>
<p>Telecommunications and transportation are the lifeline of a country, and without unified management, it is difficult to achieve the effectiveness of using arms and fingers. Therefore, the telecommunications regulations promulgated by the National Government stipulate that the telecommunications equipment established by public and private organizations or individuals must be approved by the Ministry of Transportation or its entrusted agency. And when necessary, personnel may be sent to inspect the telecommunications or the equipment may be purchased at a price. If this is not the case, it is inevitable that unscrupulous people will use telecommunications equipment as a tool for plotting wrongdoing, causing great hidden dangers to the country and society. In order to comply with national laws and maintain public security, the Ministry of Transportation must strictly crack down on illegal privately established radio stations to maintain the integrity of telecommunications management. This is one reason.</p>
<p>The transmission of wireless telecommunications relies on the oscillation of radio waves. The receiving and transmitting sides must have harmonious oscillation frequencies in order to receive clearly. Therefore, the frequencies of each station must be different in order to avoid interference, otherwise, the noise will be chaotic and it will be impossible to work. Therefore, maintaining spatial order is a necessary condition for wireless telecommunications. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation stopped issuing licenses for the establishment of stations because there were too many private broadcasting stations in this city and all frequencies had been distributed, which is one example. Those privately established radio stations that only know how to operate for personal gain and disregard the public interest are not subject to the supervision of the Ministry of Transportation, and the frequencies they transmit cannot be regulated, and spatial interference will inevitably become more serious. In order to maintain the efficiency of wireless communications, the Ministry of Transportation must severely punish privately established radio stations that disregard the overall situation. This goes without saying. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>In addition to plotting wrongdoing, which is punished by law, most privately established radio stations communicate privately to solicit commercial reports and eavesdrop on public radio stations' telegrams for profit. This type of illegal behavior not only causes losses to the telegraph office, but also poses a serious threat to the financial and news circles. According to the criminal law, "electricity is considered a property," and these privately established radio stations constitute the crime of theft and occupation. In the case of the privately established radio station of the Tianjin Yongli Yongzeng Joint Silver Company last year, the Tianjin Procuratorate filed a public prosecution for theft. All relevant parties should jointly report them and make sure that the unscrupulous people are completely eliminated. This is not only a matter of the Ministry of Transportation's crackdown. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>We have observed that in all advanced countries in the world, regardless of their political system, the laws and policies promulgated by the government must be implemented without obstruction with the sincere cooperation of the people. Therefore, the government can exercise its powers and seek welfare for the people. The crimes of privately established radio stations, such as operating for personal gain, theft, and illegality, have been described above. We believe that the people of the country will definitely support the Ministry of Transportation's crackdown policy, jointly seek ways to implement sanctions, and the people's interest and efforts in serving the public will also be reflected in this.</p>
<h3>Provisional Measures for Domestic Chinese Cipher News Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Chu Hao</p>
<p>——Effective Today, Please Note, News Media——</p>
<p>In recent months, news organizations or their reporters in various locations, transmitting news telegrams via wireless circuits, have frequently experienced eavesdropping and publication by other newspapers, resulting in significant losses of rights. They have appealed to the transportation authorities to take measures to stop this. The Ministry of Communications, upon request, immediately issued orders to all bureaus and stations to pay close attention. If any local news organization is found to be copying and publishing news, it should be dealt with according to the law. Furthermore, it has been stipulated that wherever wired circuits are available, news telegrams should be transmitted via wired circuits as much as possible. A provisional measure for domestic cipher news telegrams has also been promulgated, allowing for transmission in cipher, making it impossible for others to understand the text. In addition, plans are underway to select important wireless circuits and convert them to high-speed automatic wireless transmitting and receiving machines, greatly increasing the speed of transmitting and receiving electrical signals, making it virtually impossible for outsiders to eavesdrop. (It is noted that international radio stations all use high-speed automatic transmitting and receiving equipment, which is extremely secure and reliable.) The aforementioned cipher news telegram measure is scheduled to take effect today. Excerpts of its main content are listed below for the reference of the news media:</p>
<p>(1) Cipher news telegrams are limited to those transmitted via domestic wireless circuits of the telegraph bureaus in Peiping, Nanking, Shanghai, Hankow, Changsha, Tientsin, Tsinan, Nanchang, Foochow, Canton, Amoy, Tsingtao, Chefoo, Chengdu, Ba County, Kweiyang, Kunming, Chang'an, Kalgan, and Lanzhou. Except as specifically stipulated in these measures, all other matters shall be handled in accordance with the regulations for ordering news telegrams.</p>
<p>(2) Any news agency, periodical publisher, news management office, or its reporter (hereinafter referred to as news organization or its reporter) wishing to send cipher news telegrams shall, in accordance with Article 2 of the News Telegram Regulations, fill out an application form, together with a copy of the cipher codebook, and submit it through the receiving news organization to the local telegraph bureau for forwarding to the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications for approval. Once approved and a certificate issued, the news organization shall prepare another identical copy of the cipher codebook and send or deliver one copy each to the receiving and transmitting telegraph bureaus for record before being allowed to send such telegrams. If the cipher codebook is used for a long time or there are other reasons for replacement, the original news organization or its reporter shall prepare an identical copy of the cipher codebook and send or deliver it to the receiving and transmitting bureaus for record, and report it to the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications for filing.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to writing the text of cipher news telegrams in cipher, the original text shall be listed next to the code to facilitate review. The cipher code used shall be limited to four digits representing one Chinese character, and the fee shall be the same as for plain language news telegrams.</p>
<p>(4) The name and address of the receiving organization for cipher news telegrams shall be written in plain language, unless already registered. The word "Copress" shall be added before the name and address of the recipient as a paid identifier, counted as one word for billing purposes.</p>
<p>(5) If the cipher code of a cipher news telegram is found to be inconsistent with the deposited cipher codebook, or if there is any impropriety, the receiving and transmitting bureaus shall detain it and report it to the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications for cancellation of the news telegram transmission certificate.</p>
<p>According to the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations for Wireless Transmittal of Cipher News Telegrams issued by the Ministry of Communications in June of the eighteenth year of the Republic (1929), the content is not much different from the current measures. However, after the promulgation, very few news organizations utilized it, so the regulations were explicitly abolished in August of the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933). It is unexpected that after two years, domestic wireless news telegrams sent by the news media are often eavesdropped on, proving that cipher news telegram measures are indeed needed by the news industry, and the news media's initial failure to utilize them was a miscalculation. It is hoped that gentlemen of the news media will make full use of this meticulous and secure cipher news telegram measure in the future to protect their own interests!</p>
<h3>Advantages of the Newly Revised Regulations for Paid Official Telegram Fees</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>If senders or recipients have any questions, corrections, supplements, or cancellations regarding any part of a telegram received or sent, they can request the telegraph bureau to send a paid official telegram according to the regulations. However, senders and recipients often do not know how to use the paid official telegram method and instead directly telegraph the other party for inquiries or request corrections, supplements, or cancellations of any part of the original telegram, resulting in the loss of telegram fees. They then negotiate with the telegraph bureau to refund the fees for the original telegram or the inquiry telegram sent. From the telegraph bureau's perspective, according to the regulations, there is no obligation to refund the fees for such cases. However, from the sender's or recipient's perspective, they believe that the telegraph bureau's service is inadequate and does not provide sufficient convenience to the public, which inevitably leads to various misunderstandings. Recently, the Ministry of Communications revised and standardized the regulations for paid official telegram fees, which will take effect on August 1, 1935. I would like to explain the advantages of this measure in detail so that the public can thoroughly understand and fully utilize the paid official telegram method.</p>
<p>(1) If the recipient has any doubts about any part of the received telegram (including the address, text, signature, etc.) and believes that there is an error in transmission, they can take the telegram to the telegraph bureau and request the sending of a paid official telegram to inquire with the original sending bureau or forward the inquiry to the sender. All official telegrams back and forth are free of charge, except when the text of the original telegram was provided by the sender. The implementation of this free inquiry method for questionable words in incoming telegrams has been praised by all sectors.</p>
<p>(2) If the incoming telegram does not have the sender's signature and the recipient does not know who sent it, or if the recipient does not know the sender's current address and cannot send a reply telegram, they can request the telegraph bureau to send a paid official telegram on their behalf to inquire with the sending bureau. This official telegram is free of charge, and the requester only needs to prepay the fee for a six-word reply telegram. (If the original telegram is a domestic Chinese or foreign language telegram, regardless of the type or text, the reply telegram fee is calculated according to the domestic Chinese plain language or foreign commercial telegram rates. If the original telegram is an international telegram, regardless of the type or text, the reply telegram fee is calculated at the full rate for international commercial telegrams. However, if the requester does not want the sending bureau to reply by telegram and only needs a postal reply, the domestic postage is only the cost of a registered letter, and the international postage is only 80 centimes for registered mail). According to the old regulations, the requester had to pay the official telegram fee word by word, but with the implementation of the new regulations, the requester can save a telegram fee.</p>
<p>(3) If the sending bureau informs the sender that the telegram could not be delivered because the recipient's name and address are incomplete or incorrect, the sender can immediately request the telegraph bureau to send a paid official telegram to notify the receiving bureau to supplement or correct the recipient's name and address in the original telegram and then resend it. The words added for supplementation or correction are charged word by word. For example, supplementing the recipient's address with five words only costs the fee for five words. Correcting the recipient's name or address by one word only costs the fee for one word. According to the old regulations, the sender had to pay for the entire telegram based on the total number of words it contained. With the implementation of the new regulations, the sender can also reduce part of the telegram fee.</p>
<h3>Development of International Wireless Telephony</h3>
<p>— Guang</p>
<p>This article only covers the wireless telephone network centered on London, the capital of England. Other countries are not mentioned.</p>
<p>The beginning of international long-distance wireless telephony dates back to 1923 in the Western calendar. At that time, the British Post Office and the American Telegraph and Telephone Company cooperated in research, planning to build wireless telephone services on both sides of the Atlantic. At that time, the propagation characteristics of short waves had not yet been clarified, so it was decided to use long-wave communication.</p>
<p>After this plan was decided, both parties began to observe the propagation characteristics of radio waves in this line to determine the applicable wavelength and the power of the transmitter, so that it could be smooth and unobstructed throughout the year, regardless of season, day or night. The observation results showed that a transmitter with a power of 200 kilowatts, using a single-sideband suppressed carrier system, and a directional antenna on the receiving side, could realize commercial operations. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States worked hard to achieve success as soon as possible to benefit commerce. On the British side, the transmitting station was installed in Rugby, and the receiving station was initially installed in Wionghton and later moved to CuparEfei. The control components were all installed in the international exchange in London. On the American side, the transmitting station was installed in Rocky poin long Island, and the receiving station was installed in Houlton Maine. The control machine was installed in the New York exchange. In January 1927, commercial wireless telephone service was officially opened between London and New York, so residents of the two places could talk to each other on ordinary telephones, which shows its convenience.</p>
<p>The Anglo-American wireless telephone service was opened not long ago and achieved very satisfactory results. The lines were immediately expanded to both ends. The British end expanded to the entire United Kingdom and the European continent, while the American end connected to countries such as Canada, Mexico, and Cuba. As a result, business increased sharply, and the original long-wave lines were insufficient. At this time, short-wave radio developed extremely rapidly, and its applicability to long-distance communication was a very obvious fact. The United Kingdom and the United States conducted short-wave wireless telephone experiments on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to obtain appropriate short-wave wireless telephone equipment.</p>
<p>In June 1928, the short-wave wireless telephone experiment was successful, and the commercial line was officially opened for communication. In June and December of the following year, two more short-wave telephone lines were added to meet commercial needs.</p>
<p>In February 1930, the British wireless telephone business with ships was officially opened. In April, communication with South America also began.</p>
<p>Between 1932 and 1933, the United Kingdom successively opened wireless telephone services with South Africa, Canada, Egypt, and India. In March of this year, communication between London and Tokyo was also officially opened.</p>
<p>Observing the above-mentioned development of wireless telephony, it can be seen that London has become one of the centers of the world's wireless telephone network. The original receiving station was not sufficient, so it was moved to Baldcck in 1930. The new station covers an area of 900 acres, with more than 30 directional antennas, which shows the scale.</p>
<p>In addition to being the center of the world's wireless network, London also has submarine cables connecting major European cities. Therefore, major cities in the world that communicate with London, whether wireless or submarine cable, can be connected through London, making global electrical communication more convenient.</p>
<p>The technical difficulties of wireless telephony have been resolved by the efforts of manufacturers in the United States and other countries over the past few years. The clarity of wireless communication is now no different from that of urban telephones.</p>
<p>It is generally recognized that submarine cable telephony is only suitable for shorter distances due to the difficulty of loading. Therefore, radio is the exclusive product of long-distance telephones (over thousands of miles). With its low cost and clear communication, its future development is limitless.</p>
<p>Although the development of my country's radio business is later than that of Germany and the United States, the communication with European and American countries is being actively prepared by the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Communications and will soon be a reality. The development of international communication can be foreseen.</p>
<h3>Revenue and Expenditure Report of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications for the Twenty-Third Year of the Republic (1934)</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>In the past year, the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications has been rectifying various businesses, striving to commercialize the telecommunications industry. The reorganization of financial aspects, such as improving revenue and expenditure methods, repaying domestic and foreign debts, and paying interest on telegraph fee deposits (i.e., the telegraph fee deposit guarantee system), have also been implemented one by one. Among them, the implementation of unified revenue and expenditure has been particularly effective. The details of the process and the revenue and expenditure report for the past year are briefly described below:</p>
<p>The unified revenue and expenditure method was implemented on July 1 of last year. The Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications signed an agency payment contract and a method for collecting telegraph and telephone fees with the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. All telegraph and telephone bureaus and radio stations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, totaling more than eighty locations, should remit their telegraph and telephone fee revenue to the local Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau for temporary deposit into the Telecommunications Department's unified account in the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau. The bureaus and stations make a request form based on their actual monthly operating expenses and submit it to the Telecommunications Department for detailed review. After verification, the Savings and Remittance Bureau is notified to instruct the local Savings Bureaus to disburse the funds on schedule. The Savings and Remittance Bureau receives the telegraph and telephone fees remitted from various places, fills out a daily report form, and compiles a monthly summary of revenue and expenditure, which is sent to the Telecommunications Department for mutual verification with the reports from various bureaus and stations and for timely accounting. The auditing method is extremely strict, and the previous abuses of excessive withdrawals, fraudulent reporting, misappropriation, and arrears have been almost completely eliminated. This is the most significant benefit for the Telecommunications Department. The Postal Bureau can also use these deposits as various investments, and the benefits obtained are also considerable. Since the implementation of this method, the personnel involved on both sides have been able to cooperate sincerely and deal with all difficulties. The original contract period was set for a trial period of six months. The trial period expired in December of last year, and both parties agreed to extend it for another six months. The period expired again at the end of June of this year, and it was agreed to extend it for another year.</p>
<p>From July of last year to the end of June of this year, the total revenue was over 8.134 million yuan, and the expenditure was approximately 9.355 million yuan. The difference between revenue and expenditure was actually a deficit of 1.22 million yuan, with an average monthly deficit of 100,000 yuan. This deficit was temporarily overdrawn from the Savings and Remittance Bureau in accordance with the contract. All overdrawn principal and interest have been paid in full from time to time. The detailed figures for the annual revenue and expenditure are listed below.</p>
<h3>Answering Mr. Kang Dingji from Zhenjiang's Question</h3>
<p>— Zhong Xian</p>
<p>I recently received your letter, inquiring about the charging method of using telephone numbers to replace the recipient's address. I will provide a summary of the answers as follows:</p>
<p>Answer (1) Telegrams using telephone numbers instead of the recipient's address, such as "Peiping telephone East 2105 Wang Cheng" or "Shanghai telephone concession 94013 Tu Xiaochao," are charged as four words. However, if the receiving bureau needs to transmit the telegram to the recipient by telephone, the sender should add the word "telephone transmission" or (TF) in the fee identification column, which is counted as one word along with the telephone number book. The writing format is as follows: "TF telephone concession 8123311 Shanghai Gao Bingjun." Charged as five words. According to the above examples, if the telephone number is used to replace the recipient's address and the receiving bureau uses the local telephone bureau number to find the recipient's address and then delivers the telegram by messenger, the location and recipient's name are counted as four words. If the receiving bureau needs to transmit the telegram to the recipient by telephone, an additional "telephone transmission" or (TF) fee identification is added, and the telephone number, location, and recipient's name are counted as five words. As for the telephone number replacing the recipient's address, along with the TF fee identification, it can be counted as one word in foreign language telegrams. However, the recipient's name and location must be charged separately word by word. For example, TFSettlement 79542=Smith Shangbai should be charged as three words.</p>
<p>Answer (2) Article 5 of the method for using telephone numbers to replace the recipient's address is somewhat ambiguous. The Telecommunications Department has already telegraphed all bureaus on September 10, 1934, instructing that "the format of the location and recipient's name and address written in accordance with the first example of item A of Article 4 of the method for using telephone numbers to replace the recipient's address, that is, "Peiping telephone East 2105 Wang Cheng," should be charged as four words, and the second example should still be charged as five words." After the above telegram was clearly explained, the various telegraph bureaus should no longer have any misunderstandings. Although the writing format of the above examples is different, the distinction is very clear regarding the method and there is no contradiction.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>Written on the Opening Day of Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Ellen Key said: "The 20th century is the century of children." All civilized countries in the world have long had regulations for Children's Day. They all pay close attention to children's causes, so that children can obtain full happiness in the embrace of society. Even our backward China has a four-year history of holding Children's Year. Until this year, the Central Government, in order to expand children's activities, has stipulated that from August 1 of this year to July 30 of next year, it will be Children's Year, engaging in various promotions. This meaning is even more significant. Today is the opening day of China's Children's Year.</p>
<p>Chinese children have never been valued by society. Their position is only the private property of the family. How do we know that children are the masters of society, the country, and the nation? The future progress of society, the strength of the country, and the prosperity of the nation are all entrusted to the children of today. The 20th century society takes children as the center, which is humanity's greatest realization.</p>
<p>The expectations of Children's Year for children, in general, are nothing more than wanting Chinese children to become healthy citizens in the future so that they can seek welfare for society, the country, and the nation. But how can children become healthy citizens? This is to pay attention to the education of children. We should give each Chinese child a considerable education so that their body and mind can develop freely.</p>
<p>Regarding the education of children, China has always placed this responsibility on the family. Originally, family education was most suitable for children. But Chinese families treat children as private property. Therefore, parents in the family arbitrarily mold them into a model according to their own wishes. Wealthy families can only raise some pampered and lazy children, while ordinary families only produce a batch of ignorant children. This is detrimental to society.</p>
<p>Therefore, children in the future should be liberated from the family so that they can become social members instead of being private property of the family. The realization of Children's Year must first raise the status and rights of children. Then, society should teach and nurture them in the best way so that they can become healthy citizens with full wisdom, vibrant life, full spirit, strong physique, rich thought, and pure character.</p>
<p>But my proposition does not mean that the education of children should be borne entirely by society and that the family should not be involved at all. What I mean is that since children are the core of social organization, society should guide and handle all issues related to the education of children. And the family needs to change its original concept, take the welfare of the people as a prerequisite, and fulfill its due obligations to its children.</p>
<p>As for society to educate children, there should be sufficient facilities for various social undertakings, such as children's parks, children's libraries, children's sports fields, children's training institutions, nurseries, and juvenile reformatories. These undertakings have become commonplace in foreign countries, but they have not yet been held in our country. This is what we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>There is one thing that must be specially mentioned here, that is, Children's Year should be universal, not partial. Society should educate children, not only a few special classes, but also the children of most poor families. This is the happiness of Chinese children, and it is also the true meaning of the government's Children's Year this year.</p>
<p>Today's China has fallen into a crisis-ridden situation, and the future disasters may be even worse than today. Therefore, adults cannot shirk their responsibility for the work of saving the country, and children should also strive hard. Because the important task of revitalizing the nation in the future is waiting for the children of today to shoulder. On this opening day of Children's Year, we expect this from our beloved children in China.</p>
<h3>Faded Story</h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>The story is about loquats, but the loquat season has long passed, and the story took place a distant ten years ago, so I think this story must be faded.</p>
<p>When I first came to Shanghai, my family wanted me to return home once during the loquat season. At first, I agreed wholeheartedly. My original intention was not to perfunctory, but I really wanted to return home to eat a big meal of loquats. But after arriving in Shanghai, I really lived a muddled life. Watching baskets and baskets of golden loquats go on the market, my heart really wanted to fly over the Yangtze River to the loquat courtyard in the north. My family wrote several times, saying that the loquats were about to ripen, saying that the loquats were full of trees, but I was lazy and couldn't muster the interest to go back.</p>
<p>Recently, the scorching sun is in the sky, and I am determined to return to the countryside. Knowing that I will not be able to eat loquats anyway on this trip, I still think of loquats day and night, and even in my dreams I see golden loquats hanging on the branches...</p>
<p>Ten years ago, when I was still a child, from the time the loquats bloomed, I cared about their growth every day. At that time, my grandmother had not yet passed away. The old lady had nothing to do all day long, and she cared about the loquats every day like a child. From the time the loquats turned yellow, she used all her strength to deal with the loquat trees. During the day, she lay sideways on a bamboo chair that was so ripe it was red, and watched the loquat trees all day long. At night, she didn't even light the kerosene lamp, and she still lay sideways on a bamboo chair that was so ripe it was red, guarding the loquat trees. Originally, there was no need to guard them, but we children were too wild. We still wanted to eat green loquats, and of course the yellow loquats were in danger. So grandmother had to guard them, and if necessary, use her only weapon - a cane - to beat the children who stole loquats.</p>
<p>Of course, I was extremely afraid. Although I wanted to steal them, I pretended to be very docile in front of my grandmother.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>a very obedient child. Therefore, grandmother especially treasured me among the children, but the so-called treasure was only said verbally, and I could not get golden loquats because of it. In desperation, I still had to resort to "stealing." Because I was too tired at night, I fell asleep deeply as soon as I got into bed. When I woke up, everything was silent, and of course it was still late at night. So I secretly got up and climbed up the loquat tree. At that time, everything was quiet except for the dog who knew me well wagging its tail at me. I picked big and yellow loquats and ate them under the stars. One by one, I ate until my jaw was sore before climbing down, falling on the bed, and sleeping soundly. The next day, in front of my grandmother, I was still a very docile and obedient child.</p>
<p>My father and mother were too frugal, so buying fruit was not allowed. That's why I could only satisfy my only desire in a moment of the night.</p>
<p>Grandmother picked the golden loquats and hid them inside, not even willing to eat them freely herself. Of course, I didn't understand this at the time. When the loquats turned color and were about to rot, she beckoned me and gave me five or six, which was a great gift in her eyes, because she treasured me. As for the other children, they didn't even get the rotten ones.</p>
<p>Now my grandmother has passed away, and the story has long faded, but I chew on this story every time I see golden loquats every year. If I go back during the loquat season in recent years, of course I can eat loquats to my heart's content. But as I get older, my interest fades. The irretrievable childhood is just like the irretrievable setting sun going west... I am anxious to return home, the weeds on my grandmother's grave are probably green again, and soon, the hot summer will pass and the clear autumn will come, and the green weeds should be withered and yellow again.</p>
<h3>Gambling Rush</h3>
<p>— Ding Weinan</p>
<p>Turning a corner, the deep, long alley was left behind. My footsteps stretched my shadow long, the vast, dark square covered my vision, and in the distant woods, dogs howled.</p>
<p>Bright light shone from the town over there.</p>
<p>It was still two or three li to get there!</p>
<p>"Old Three, pick up the pace, it's getting late! Maybe some stalls are already closed, and we need to try our luck too!" The one calling out to Old Three reeked of alcohol. He was staggering and waving his hand. Although it was dark and his face couldn't be seen clearly, the outline of his shadow was visible. He kicked a small stone, and with a thud, he stumbled, as if in slight pain.</p>
<p>"Hey, drunkard, Old Huang's 'Azure Dragon' game last night, I really predicted it accurately. There really was a 'way' to win! One bet, and I overturned the whole stall! I really have the skill. If you weren't with me, you'd surely lose money!" Old Three's voice echoed in the darkness, and you could see him gesturing with his big fingers.</p>
<p>"Stop bragging! Are you really that accurate? If you were so rich, why does your wife still scold you like a dead pig?" The dark shadow behind Old Three interjected, indistinctly. It sounded like he was tilting his head a few times, and perhaps making a mocking sound, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>"How could I not be accurate? You useless fool, I've been hustling outside longer than all of you... As for my wife scolding me, hah, she wouldn't dare!"</p>
<p>"Stop running your mouth, we can all see it!"</p>
<p>"The drunkard is actually afraid of his wife," Old Three teased. "He secretly drank some wine tonight. When I passed his door, he secretly winked at me. Of course, his wife was eating beside him, but I knew he was telling me to wait for him. Drunkard, isn't that right?" He turned his head to look back, leading the way.</p>
<p>"Isn't that the truth? Last night was really noisy. Luckily, he hadn't lost any money and was able to show her some, which calmed things down. She really keeps a tight rein on him. He's definitely a wife-dominated man! Haha, Drunkard, you!"</p>
<p>The drunkard didn't respond, walking with his head tilted to the side.</p>
<p>The sound of gongs and drums reached their ears. The stars hid in the high sky, squinting their eyes. The Earth was watching, the moon had not yet rolled out.</p>
<p>They strode forward, the darkness kept at bay by the circle of light. In front of the Kang Wang Temple, many small vendors had set up stalls on the ground, with a scattering of melon seed shells and the suffocating, dizzying smell of fried oil. Countless faces, old, young, male, and female, were all facing the gambling tables, turning their backs to the bodhisattvas in the temple. The atmosphere was strangely murky.</p>
<p>The three men's heads were squeezed into the crowd around the gambling stalls. Bright gas lamps hung high above, so bright you could see a fallen needle on the ground. Dice jumped around in the treasure box, clanging and tinkling. With a cry of "Azure Dragon" or "Tiger," the gamblers' faces turned either flushed or pale.</p>
<p>Like foam merging into the sea, their shadows disappeared, everything lost in the shouts and cheers of the gambling game!</p>
<h3>The Bamboo Buzz (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tian Hu</p>
<p>One afternoon, a few days after returning home, I was fanning myself with a palm leaf fan under a large locust tree, enjoying the cool. Suddenly, I saw my fourth younger brother in the threshing ground, flapping his arms and energetically spinning a bamboo buzz toy.</p>
<p>"Buzz... buzz..." The continuous sound gradually broke the silence of the meadow. Behind my fourth brother, many children watched the bamboo buzz, which seemed like a strange object, with envious expressions.</p>
<p>My fourth brother was very proud. After he stopped spinning the toy, his companions surrounded him with flattering expressions, talking to him. He used an assertive tone to tell his companions about the origins of the bamboo buzz.</p>
<p>Indeed, in our village, this bamboo buzz was still a rare object. My fourth brother's was bought from Old Kunhe's teahouse in Saint Hall. I don't know why, but Old Kunhe had a flash of inspiration this time and ordered this item from the city. Yesterday, I took my fourth brother to the teahouse and happened to see it, so I bought one for him.</p>
<p>My fourth brother seemed tired of playing. He tied the two bamboo sticks and a bamboo rod into a ball shape with a drawstring, held it on his head, and went into the house with a very proud expression, while his companions watched with envy.</p>
<p>The scene made me feel somewhat disgusted. I saw my fourth brother and said to him, "Just because you have a bamboo buzz, you act like you've found a treasure and show off in front of others. You have one, and they don't. Be careful of making others unhappy; they might not want to play with you!"</p>
<p>"They don't have one, they're all jealous of me, especially Little Fire Root..." My fourth brother quickly turned his head. He seemed to know that if he said too much, I would scold him, so he ended his sentence with a gentle smile, ending what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>Two days later, in the afternoon, I was sitting by the west window reading a book when suddenly, a loud buzzing sound and children's chatter filled the air. Disturbed, I strolled to the threshing ground and saw eight or nine children from the village, who usually gathered together, all with bamboo buzz toys, having a great time spinning them with the drawstrings. My fourth brother was also among them, jumping around the busiest. But ten steps away from the group, stood a very ugly child, sticking out his thumb, watching the lively group with a silly grin. As soon as I saw his left eye drooping, I recognized him: it was Little Fire, the son of Bing Sheng, who sells salty soup in the village. (To be continued)</p>
