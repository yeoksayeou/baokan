<h3>公務員考績之意義</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>考績法施行細則。已由考院通過。並經國府公布。各地公務人員之應受考核者。銓部正在研求步驟。預計年終必可實施。會見濫竽之徒。無由復充下陳。精良之士。愈益顯其效能。較之專就資格爲甄別之標準者。不更爲切合實際之辦法乎。</p>
<p>由來獵官者以依附爲能事。忘夤緣之非正。故一人發迹。親屬彈冠。淮南得道。雞犬同升。亦旣蔚爲相承之風氣矣。自經國民政府嚴厲取締。以保障原來人員之任用。上下相喩。淩知自斂。一般走馬上任者。已不復有大批夾袋之人物。爲漫無限制之遷調。然而赫赫權貴。猶多以薦牘相投。攻瑣姻婭。難免申浸潤之想。其不能無局部之安揷。亦意計中應有之現象也。平心而論。一官綢繆責任匪輕。祗憑個人之力量。深慮耳目之難周。其必欲借重親信之人物。以謀指使之便利。非唯爲人情所容許。抑亦應專實之需要。其爲他方汲引來者。果有肆應之才。亦復不妨試用。若無片技可取。便應置而不問。內舉原不在乎避親。權勢詎足以滙吾事。所部人才主義。固選士之唯一原則也。</p>
<p>方今職業恐慌。瀰漫全國。懷才求售者。比比皆是。而各機關競以人滿爲言。絕無通融餘地。顧按諸實際。在大批公務人員中。其眞能實心辦事者。殆十不二三覯。至少有一部分爲坐領巨俸優游無所事事者。此輩冗衍人員。大都經過相當煊染。挾有奧援而來。論資格非不堂皇。相舉北亦多活潑。徒以憑藉獨厚。甘自趨於沉淪。寖且妨及他人之程作。坐陷機構於停滯。影響所曁。固不僅尸位素餐而巳。主持其上者亦非不知形勢之僵持。而卒碍於情面之難却。徒懷才難之歡。莫平寮屬之憤。一方有不堪調劑之工作。一方有旁皇求事之人才。而横來無用之傖荒壅關其間。使之無法接近。在公家爲妨碍賢路。對自己爲戕賊本能。言綱紀則廢頓黜陟。論主計則慮縻國帑。非事之深堪扼腕者乎。考績法之施行。卽在就事實所指示。謀澈底之澄淸。使資格無可掩護。奧援難爲申請。當局不必瞻徇。同僚得免湮抑。是有望於銓郎之切實執行矣。</p>

<h3>科學叢談</h3>
<p>— 中國科學社主編李寅恭　馬大浦</p>
<p>森林與人生</p>
<p>大陸之上，產生材木之樹種所叢生之地，謂之森林，其樹木稱林木，土地稱林地。故森林者，實合林木與林地之總稱也。</p>
<p>上古之時，人口稀少，茫茫大地，幾全爲森林所被覆，故森林主副產物，大有取之不盡，用之不竭之概，此爲森林極盛時代。其後人口日增，森林產物漸感供不應求，於是游牧農耕，次第發展，開墾林地，蠺食林木，此爲森林初衰時代。復次，森林因農業之發展，旣日見减少，而人類以森林爲開墾陣碍，誤解森林爲無用之物，乃肆意濫伐焚燬，致木材之取得，漸生困難，此爲森林漸衰時代。及至民智大開，工商業發達，木材之需要日增，用途日廣，市儈之輩，乃大肆砍伐，遂至森林荒廢，山石暴露，影響所及，河塞山崩，氣候失調，不僅感覺木荒已也。</p>
<p>森林因人類之滋繁，而遭催燬，略如上述。惟人類之生活，有賴於森林者，　繁，至森林缺乏之害顯著之後，森林建設之科學方始濫觴。茲將森林與人類之關係，分直接與間接二項述之如后。</p>
<p>（一）森林與人生之直接關係</p>
<p>生產木村木材爲森林主要產物，亦即人類生活上不可或缺之品，舉凡建築用村，交通用材，以及吾人一切日用品所需，鮮有能缺木材而可成者。近年科學進步，木材之用途漸見推廣，如分解木材而爲木漿，以供製紙織布及製造人造絲與假象牙之原料，或乾餾木材以取柏油，木醋，木精，與阿歇通等工業原料。近且有以木材用爲製糖釀酒之原料者。是木材之用途日見擴張，關係吾人之衣食住行，至重且大也。</p>
<p>供給副產　森林除主產木材之外，尙能產生副產，如楮皮造紙，桐實取油，椿葉供食，松液製脂。其他如香蕈，銀耳，肉桂，厚朴等貴重食品藥品，亦莫非樹木之產物。至林中棲息之鳥獸，林地生長之食菌與下草，亦爲林間重要之副產也。</p>
<p>發展资本容納勞工森林爲大企業之一種，佔國民經濟重要之部分，其資本包括林木和生長林木之林地。凡不宜於農作物生長之土地，均可造林。據估計世界森林面積約有七十五萬萬英畝，以如此廣大之林地，每年對於造林，採運，造材，等工作，及其副產之製造，所需資本之大，與容納工人之多，自可想見。據聞美國於一九三三年度，曾招失業未婚靑年三十萬名，從事林業工作，是年經費預算爲二萬五千萬元，此外中央常年林業經費，尙有美金三千六百三十二萬五千三百二十三元之多。</p>
<p>（二）森林與人生之閒接關係</p>
<p>調和氣候　據歐美各國專家之試騐，林閒氣溫常較林外氣溫畫間凉而夜閒暖，夏季凉而冬季暖。因林地被樹冠所蓋，陽光未能直射林地，因之陽光之熱不易侵入。及至夜間，林內之熱，亦因枝葉之覆蔽，難於放散，故因空氣之漸漸流動，林內之氣溫因得調和，即林外附近之氣溫，亦受其影響，而成一種森林之溫和氣候。至於濕度，因森林能滿養多量水分，故亦比無林地爲高，因之能增加該地方降雨之度數，而减除久旱久雨之害。此森林之所以能調和氣候也。</p>
<p>涵養水源　森林因樹　　茂，故當降雨之際，雨水先注樹冠，再徐徐滴入林內。因雨水遲滯流下之結果，除地被物能盡量吸收水分外，復使多量水分，得滲透地中，被樹木之根鬚吸蓄潛伏，緩緩流出。故雖逢久早，而森林附近，亦有源源不斷之湧泉也。</p>
<p>障固泥土森林因林木之根鬚散蔓，故能强固泥土之結合力，雖傾斜坡地之土砂，亦不致因雨崩溜。且森林之樹冠及林內之地被物，蔽蓋地面，使不受雨水之直接打擊，其降雨經樹冠徐徐注入林內，除被林被物吸收及滲入土中者外，流出之雨水量少而流綏，無冲刷泥土之力。故有森林之地，决無剝蝕之虞也。</p>
<p>减少水旱災査水災成立之原因，不外水量驟漲，河道淤塞。森林旣能涵蓄水源，則當大雨久雨之際，一部分降水被森林所吸收，河川水量，自不致驟增。復因森林能障固泥土，自森林流出之水，則不致挾帶砂土，塡塞河身。至於早災之造成，厥因不外缺乏雨水，與缺乏地下水二端。森林能增加降雨之度數，又能滿蓄多量之地下水，使之漸次流入溪澗。故森林防水防旱，均具相當之效力也。</p>
<p>防止風砂及頽雪在遼闊之海岸，或廣大之平原，若無森林爲之遮蔽，則當暴風之時，砂土飛揚，害物傷人，危險實大。若森林繁茂，則林木枝葉之擴張，必足减殺風砂之遷移能力。如能在砂原之地，建造森林，因樹根之機械作用，沉定土砂，尤爲上策。如法國之加斯可內地方，有八十萬法畝之土地，完全爲一砂原，自一千八百零十年開始營造此項飛砂防止林，現已成爲法之第一森林區域矣。又當氣候寒冷之山地，冬季積雪不化，待春季氣候溫和，則雪塊溶解，向山下移動，而損害人民之生命財產。如有林木爲之障蔽，則山上之雪，受林木之支持，自不至下墜而發生頽雪矣。</p>
<p>點綴風景森林爲構成風景之要素，具特有之美觀，故能陶養吾人之性情。復因森林景象莊嚴靜肅，因之森林附近之居民，亦被其感化而富於沈勇質朴之精神。故古人云，山川秀麗出偉人，又云，山中心自在，即此意也。</p>
<p>裨益衛生空氣爲吾人生活中不可或缺之要素，故空氣淸潔與否，影響人類生活實大。林木因光合作用，旣能遊離氧氣，供給人類之需要，復因林內含有多量之臭氧，能消滅不潔之氣體，煤烟，及有害之細菌等類。故山居人民，多康健而壽長者，要非偶然也。</p>
<p>保護漁獵森林爲野生禽獸棲息養食之所。如無森林，則鳥獸無所依據。故森林與鳥獸之關係易爲吾人所認識。至謂森林與漁類之關係，則因森林落下之果葉，隨水流入河川，足供魚類食餌，森林陰影投入水面，可資魚類休憇。又森林能調節河川水量，以防河床埋沒，且能使水苔水草及微生物生育繁殖，佛如椿業蘋之屬，供魚類樓餌，復能調節河川之溫度，防止河水挾帶砂泥，裨益魚類衛生非淺。</p>
<p>改良土琅森林能將低濕地及乾燥地化為適當生產地。如同沼澤的地方，只須一次將水排除之後，種植適宜樹種，造成濕地林，藉樹冠之蒸發作用，可使土中的水分適宜。至於輕鬆乾燥草木不長之砂地，亦可栽植抗旱的樹種，或豆科植物，藉林內的落葉枯枝及豆科植物根瘤固定氮素之作用，土埌亦可改良。如德國東普魯士之海岸，係一不毛之砂原，嗣經政府勵行造林，現亦成爲生產利源之地。森林改良土琅之效足見一斑。</p>
<p>便利航行現今航海事業發達，重要之港灣島嶼及岬角，莫不設置燈塔及浮標，以圖航路之安全。惟無此項目標之處，仍多以陸地形狀爲標準。森林高於陸地，實爲最善之航行目　也。</p>
<p>森林關係人生之重要，已如上述。據實業部發表吾國宜林荒地之面積，不下五十餘萬萬市畝之多，幾佔國十總面積三分之一。此　大面積之荒地，吾人應如何努力從事造林及愛護野生樹，以增生產，直接使吾人之衣食住行，不感覺原料之缺乏，間接使吾人生活上得着安全也。</p>

<h3>青年與國家（下）</h3>
<p>（十月二十九·三十一日對全國中等學校學生講）</p>
<p>中央大學教授錢端升</p>
<p>我們民族第三個缺點是冷酷性的普遍。冷酷與自私是有連帶關係的，我們國人有一句成語呌做「明哲保身」，又有一副聯語呌做「各人自掃門前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜」，這都可以形容一班人民持躬接物的精神。我記得前幾年有一位姓翁的先生，因事從南京坐汽車到杭州中途汽車翻了，這位翁先生也受了重傷，過了數十分鐘，有一部汽車從後疾駛而過，對於這呻吟乞救的翁先生竟理也不理，這種冷酷，在中國是極普遍的現象。然而這種缺點深足以使我們的民族成爲少進取心缺乏勇氣且缺乏團結力的民族。</p>
<p>講到我國的土地，也是有好有壞，好的地方是我國的面積廣大，寒熱溫三帶之地我們都有。但我們也不能不知道我們的短處，我們常自稱地大物博，實則我們地雖大而物則並不博，我們與蘇聯及美國雖同爲大國，但論地面上的產品與地下的蘊藏，我國與美國蘇聯俱不能相比。地下的煤鐵及石油地上的森林，都是近代富國强兵的要素，但我國的供給俱不當裕。即以農產品而言，我國的產量在兩國之下，而且美國不常有水旱災，蘇聯少有水旱災，而我國的水災旱災又一爲常見之事。黄河的水患，歷數千年，而未有解决的方法，長江的水患，在從前本是不常見的事，近年因爲諸大湖的淤塞，及土豪劣紳之侵略湖田，江水乃亦常常汜濫。所以我們萬萬不可以地大物博自豪。我們地雖大而生產力並不大。爲增進我們國家的地位起見，我們尙須努力於水患的防止，植林的運動，農產力的增加，以及石油代用品的發明專等。</p>
<p>講到主權，我們應熟知近幾十年來主權被優害的歷史，以及取近主權喪失的過程。剛纔已經講過，主權為獨立國家的原素之一。但是我們在近幾十年來，外國的領事官吏或司法官吏在中國國土上享有審判權，外國人在中國犯罪不歸中國法院審理，而歸外國官廳審理。外國人在中國又有駐兵之權。到了最近，外國人可以破壞我們領土的完整，及行政權的統一；更可硬要我們做這件事，或不許我們做那件事。這樣地侵害主權，實足以剝奪我國的獨立，而便成為一個半獨立的國家。</p>
<p>知道了我國人民土地及主權的狀態，才能知道我國的可愛，並且也知道我國的可憂。我國有衆多的人民，偉大的民族及廣表的面積，這種國家着實値得我們的愛護，我們也着實可以自傲。但是我國的民族有缺點，土地的蘊藏不大富，而主權又不完全；這些又着實値得我們的憂慮。靑年們—你們對國家的第一任務，旣在愛國救國，你們便不得不力求熟知國家的一切。認識中國才會愛中國；認識中國，才能救中國！</p>
<p>（二）要做一個好國民</p>
<p>對於國家的認識愈深切，愛國心也自然愈會濃厚，不過僅僅有濃厚的愛國心，還是負不了救國的大任。靑年們更要努力做一個好國民，努力取到國民的修養。上面已經說過我們民族本有許多重大的缺點，要中國的人民能有進步，能成爲較好的國民，居於未來主人翁地位的靑年自然應以模範國民自期。</p>
<p>要做中國的好國民，要做未來的模範國民，條件甚多、嚴重要的有下列六個：</p>
<p>第一，青年應有合作的精神。合作的精神就是從前所謂合羣的精神。中國人向來缺乏這種精神，中國人的不能合作，隨處均有表現，在政治的方面，政黨不容易在中國發展，因爲中國人是向來「朋而不黨，」的少數人的政治結合是容易有的，多數人的共同政治生活是難能的，在商的方面，健全的公司制度也是不容易發達的。中國人不是不能經商，中國人僅是不能合作經商，中國人所以缺乏合作精神的理由，並不簡單，敎育的不發達，也是一個重要的原因，但其最大原因有二：一是缺乏合作的訓練，一二是缺乏遵守規律，迷信規律的習慣。所以要養成合作的精神，在靑年時代，即須有名作的訓練，且須絕對服從規律。</p>
<p>現在的靑年正在受着學校的敎育，學校　訓練合菜的最好塲所。學校裏頭少不了種種的會，種種的團體，設立這種會及團體的目的也許很簡單，很平凡，但是靑年們不應有所輕視，應充分加入活動，因爲在這種好像沒有什麽目的的會或團體中，靑年最易得到團體生活的經騐及合作的訓練，這種經騐和這種訓練，是將來一切合作的基礎。</p>
<p>恪遵規律的精神也是人羣合作的基本條件：沒有恪遵規律的精神，合作即不能有恃久性，也不能有較大的規模。少數人的團結尙可以感情爲維繫衆多人的結合，則非有共同遵守的規律不可。再以政黨及公司爲醫喻，政黨要維持黨組織，推行全賴黨綱，黨員之能服從黨的規律就是黨紀，如果黨員不遵守黨紀，則黨的組織便不免四分五裂而黨的政綱也無從推行。公司要維持公司的地位，股東對於公司的章程也不能不絕對遵守。假如股東不肯邀守一定的章程，而處處爲自己打算，則公司也未有不衰敗或破產者。如果政黨與公司的繁榮需要遵守規律的精神，其他一切羣的生活更無不需要這精神，如果規律是這般的規定，我們便應這般地　做，即使於自己不利，也應有犧牲的精神　即使妨害友誼私交，也只能不顯，我國人民向來最重私情，這與遵守法規的精神根本衝突，靑年們應縣爲勵戒，不然合作的精神是無從發揮無從養成的。</p>
<p>第二靑年應有尙武的精神，我中華民族素性好和平，和平也是一種極好的民埃性，我們當然應保存着。而且要世界大同，全世界的民族　得崇尙和平，不過現在的世界，尙不是和平的世界，而我們中國是被壓迫的國家，這些都是事實，總理極力提倡世界大同主義及和平主義，但他也主張我們應先爭得民族的平等。他所以有這樣的主張，就是因爲中華民族，如不能爭得平等，則絕對不能爲世界上被壓迫的民族打不平，他說：「我們受屈民族必要把我們民族自由平等的地位，恢復起來之後，才配講世界主義」。這裏所謂世界主義就是世界大同的意思。我敢說：我們如不知尙武不能自衛，則這個世界中將絕對沒有我國立足的餘地，更談不到大同。</p>
<p>提倡尙武精神在我國也已經有了三四十年的歷史了，自光緒甲午年中國敗於日本而後，一班有識之士即提倡尙武，到了日俄之戰，日本戰勝俄國而後，受過新敎育的人更是極力提倡這種精神，體操這門功課，就從這個時候流行起來，開學堂也必設立體操課目。但尙武精神的提出　管　這末長的歷史，實際上我們民族仍是十　分的缺乏尙武精神，這到底是什麽原因呢？這是因爲一方面中國讀書人瞧不起當兵的傳習太根深而蒂固，又一方面則這幾十年的軍隊也着實使人瞧不起，現在國家的生命旣危險萬分，而軍隊的名譽又遠比從前爲佳，則正在讀書的靑年們自應痛改從前讀書人的錯誤看法。讀書人應當把當兵看做一件最榮譽的事，所謂尙武精神决不是參加加運動，鍜鍊體格的意思，多作運動練成强健體格，固然也狠重要，但是現在的靑年應當準備當兵，準備枕戈衛國；不然，就不能做一好國民。這是尙武精神的眞意義。</p>
<p>第三靑年應有樂於勞力的精神，中國過去的所調士大夫階級，中國從前的讀書人，旣瞧不起當兵，也瞧不起做工，有智識的人不肯當兵足以亡國，有智識的人瞧不起勞働，同樣的可以亡國，我們要知道中國是工業農業落後的國家。工農業的落後，其足以亡國絲毫不亞於軍備的落後，或者還在軍備落後以上。因爲工農業發達的國家，武備是極容易補充的，只消國民有尙武的精神，工農業如不發達，則國民縱然有尙武精神，也是不易有好的軍備，我們可以舉幾個例，美國是工農業極發達而不設常備軍的國家，但美國於一九一七年向德國官戰後，在一年之內即訓練出來了三百多萬極好的軍隊，阿比西尼亞人是冉尙武冉好戰不過的了，但是因爲工農業極不發達，所以意大利敢加欺侮，我敢說阿比西尼亞的工農業如果有意大利工農業一半的程度，意大利就不敢欺侮他。我國也是工農業落後的國家。這也就是我國被人欺侮的主因。</p>
<p>所以僅有軍隊，而沒有工農業做後盾，民族的自由平等是决然得不到的，但要發展工農業，則單靠無智識的人去努力去做工人農夫，也是不成的，一定要有智識的人不怕做工，不怕耕種，工農業才能發達，近代的工業農業不是簡單的事情，近代的工農業是技術的工作。如果有智識的人畏懼勞力，老不動手，則工農業决然不易有進步的。我們常常看見國內外大學工學院農學院，或工農專門學校畢業的學生，因爲怕勞力，所以只知工農業方面的一些理論，而不能勝任担負實際的事業。這種現象是十二分可以悲觀的，所以現代的靑年務須痛改從前讀書人這種短處，現代的靑年務須有樂於勞力的精神，才能做好國民，才能救中國。</p>
<p>第四，靑年要有急公好義的精神，冷酷爲我們民族性上的一大缺點，上面已經說過，路上有人被汽車撞傷了，大家圍觀而不知救護，是冷酷性的表現，甲地方有了水災旱災，乙地方的人，甚或甲地方富有的人，儘管取樂，不知解囊相助，也是冷酷性的表現。國家亡了，準備做亡國奴，不知廉恥的人甚且靦顏事敵，做僞國的臣子，也是冷酷性的表現。這種劣根性一日不驅除民族一日不會有希望。但是怎樣的驅除這冷酷的省根性呢？那只有提倡念公好義的精神。童子軍中提倡這種精神甚爲有力，我以爲現代的靑年，無論加入童子軍與否，都應養成急公好義的精神，面且更貴躬自實行，遇到人家有災難，務須出力相助，遇到旁人被人欺侮務須打不平。做人要有些　氣，不要太聰明，不要只管一己的利益，而不講義氣。</p>
<p>我們更要知道，急公好義的精神是和合作的精神與尙武的精神有連帶關係的。如果不急公，不好義，合作的困難便要增加；而尙武的精神也不易養成。</p>
<p>第五，靑年應各習職業。我國從前的讀書人，在消極方面，不肯當兵，不肯做工；在積極方面，却又太喜做官，無論其是否爲科舉制度的流毒，在現在的世界，實有痛改的必要。做官本不是一件壞事，行政也可說是一種職業，但不想有一專門的職業，而專想在官塲中混混，則是一件極壞的事情：大家如果想做官，則第一必定官太多，人浮於事，政治不會弄好，第二必定優秀的人多往官塲走，別的職業受影響，第一種現象就是中國現代的現象，不必再有說明。第二種現象，我們可以美國的情形來說明。美國人的喜歡賺錢，等於中國人的喜歡做官。如果中國人是官迷，美國人可說是財迷。在美國，做商意，做律師，俱是極賺錢的事，而做官是極不賺錢的事，比做大學敎授還要不如。所以美國的政界無傑出的人材。中國則反是中國的政界實在不少才智之士。不過政界的人不能太多，因爲中國政界的人太多，其他各界固然感到人才的缺乏，而政治則因人太多而渾沌。如果靑年們能自今日起各就其性之所近，修習一種職業，則各種職業方面，旣可藉供求相應律的施行，而不感人材的缺乏，政界方面，也不致有人浮於事之弊。</p>
<p>第六，靑年應預備參加政治。習了職業並不是就不須管政治。政治是人人應管的事。習職業的意思僅在附制做官的人。管政治則與做官的人不同。不可多一人想做官，却不可有一人不管政治，中國從前的毛病，就是讀書人？人想做官，而不識字的人沒有一個會管政治；結果，做官的人太多了，管政治的人却少了。要除去這種流弊，一方面固須希望人人有專門的職業。庶幾做官的人不會太多，另一方面則不論操那種職業的人，都須對於政治有興趣，都須管政治。古人云「天下興亡匹夫有責」這就是說國家的事，任何人都有現任　這也就等於說國家的政治，人人都得過問。</p>
<p>那末怎樣才配管政治呢？第一要留心國事，國內之事及國際之事都在內；第二要受關於四種政權的訓練。</p>
<p>國事要留心，現在的靑年一方面想做官的人仍嫌太多另一方面留心國事的人則嫌不够多。就學生們看報的一事而言，我可以套孔子一句話，『我未見好讀政治新聞如好讀運動親聞或社會新聞者也』這不是一個好現象。要管政治，必須熟知政治的情形。我國一般中學生對於本國政治的了解遠及不上英美一般中學生對於英美政治的了解：此所以我國國民管政治的能力及興趣俱遠趕不上英美國民管政治的能力及興趣。</p>
<p>但僅知政治上的情形，而不知連用四權也是無濟於事。所謂四權即創制，複决，選舉，及罷免，創制爲人民提出法律案，請求立法機關議决通過之權。複决爲人民對於立法機關已通過的法律案投票贊否之權。選舉即選出公務昌之權，罷免爲人民對於，公務員投票表示是否令其去職之極：依照總理的五權憲法，這四種政權。操之於國民，由國民用投票的方式行使，或舉出國民大會，由國民大會代國民行使。無論如何解釋，要有管政治的能力，自然須先有運用這四種政治的能力。所以運用這四種的訓練，是靑年們所萬萬不可忽視者。</p>
<p>以上所舉出的六點均爲中國好國民所不可缺少的條件。如果靑年們能身先領導，努力具備上述六種條件，則十年二十年而後，中國國民的智識與能力必可大大提高，救國的工作亦不難領導起來。固然除了這六點之外，靑年國民尙有共他應行注意之點，但上述六個確最重要。</p>
<p>現代有志的優秀的靑年，對於國家有不少人抱悲觀的態度。國家的危念及社會的粉亂，我也承認，但悲觀不是辦法。我奉勸諸位靑年要努力認識我們的國家，努力做一好國民，愈是努力，愈是無暇悲觀，好國民愈多，國家也愈有望。靑年們，你們要盡你們應盡的資任，才對得起國家。</p>

<h3>輪船業呈六中全會　請速發行航業公債</h3>
<p>民營航業已陷絕境　坐視不援勢必</p>
<p>上海輪船業同業公會、呈中央執行委員會第六次全體會議、瀝陳航業衰頹、請准予發行公債一千萬元、茲錄其原呈如下、</p>
<p>瀝陳困難請賜援助</p>
<p>呈爲民營航業、陷于絕境、現狀難維、勢將崩潰、瀝陳困難各點、仰祈鑒核、迅賜援救事、竊査航運事業、負有重大使命、在在與國家有深切關係、非其他商業可比、宜爲政府所重視、冀有以維護之扶植之也、我國民營航業、本極幼稚、加以經營是業者資本多不充實、在昔運輸暢旺時期、不過勉以維持、殊少發展能力、頻年以來、時局多故、災患迭乘、以致屢遭打擊、元氣受傷、近更因百業蕭條、運輸减少、輪船無貨裝載、停止航行者日見增多、航商丁斯時會、營業衰微、借貨吿絕、山窮水盡、無法圖存、長此以往、將見民營航業、一蹶而不可再振、瞻念前途、實堪痛惜、茲特舉目前所最困難各點、爲鈞會陳之、</p>
<p>限制航綫引起糾紛</p>
<p>（一）輪船行駛航綫、各航業先進國、本無限制規定、大都以其輪船本身狀况與能力、而分爲遠洋·沿海·江湖·三種、並無列舉各口岸地名者、我國輪船、現在行駛航綫、須在所領航綫證書上、臚列各處地名、若未列入、不准行駛、考其立法初意、大槪以我國受不平等條約關係、外輪暢行內地、所以列舉地名，而略示限制之、不料現在外輪、反不受此拘束、只須臨時憑該管領事之一紙公函、便可隨意開航、而受拘束者、獨我國人航商矣、航商受此束縛、耗時間金錢、已屬匪細、乃近來主管航業之交通部對內港數航綫、有「在整理航業方案未公布前暫維現狀」之命令、對未領有航綫證書及已領有航綫證書各船、均不准加入行駛、其目的雖欲弭止糾紛、但供求旣未相應、苦樂愈見不均、糾紛反因是而引起、此困難之點一也、</p>
<p>國營民營自相競爭</p>
<p>（二）自招商局收歸國營之後、航業始有國營民營之分、政府舉辦國有航業、而同時獎勵與保護民營航業、均為約法所明定、今對國營與民營間、既無分工合作之規定、已有自相競爭之事實、而各項應得之權利、國營有優先獨享、應盡之義務、反民營負担較多、長此以往、不但航權之收回無期、民航之破產立待、此困難之點二也、</p>
<p>水陸聯運不應獨攬</p>
<p>（三）鐵路與輪船之水陸聯運、旣便利貨物之運轉、復關係交通之銜接、各國均早實行、我國自廿二年度瓶辦以來、民營再三請求、始准一律參加、但國營招商局始終意欲獨攪、奉交鐵兩部核、准參加之後、一味延宕、百般阻撓、故奉准雖已有年餘、而民營仍未沾　瀝、此困難之點三也、</p>
<p>噸鈔附捐無力續擔</p>
<p>（四）交通部恢復吳淞商船學校、因復興之需費較鉅、而國家預算、不及列入、故派員蒞商、航商爲造就人才、冀挽國權起見、勉担噸鈔附捐三成以促成、原爲一時權宜捐助之計、但十八年迄今、繼繽已經六載、年在十萬元以上、外籍商輪旣無此担負、相形之下、已覺困難、近更自顧不遑、委實無力續担、國家敎育經費、年支甚鉅、對此國立唯一之商船學校、當不難加入預算、歷呈交通部尙未蒙俯准停征、此困難之點四也、</p>
<p>航業公債宜速發行</p>
<p>（五）十九年間、航商以營業凋敝、金融窘迫、呈准政府發行航業公債一千萬元、以資救濟、其辦法以輪船低利押貸、十年之後、復備充開闢國際航綫之用、乃核准有案、而發行無期、近受市面影響、航業衰頹、更甚於前、爰又屢申前請、以救垂亡、財政部始終以基金無法移撥、一時未便議及發行相批答、而就航商所知、噸鈔餘欵、年在數十萬元、以之撥充基金、綽有餘裕、且以航商所繳之欵、而救濟航業、尤屬允當、按諸各國政府對於民營航業、無不力予維持、卽以近鄰日本而言、定期行駛之船、有减船鈔之保護政策、剏建新船、除有四分之一貼欵、其餘四分之三復可低利押借、而最近規定、舊船改換新船、每舊船一噸、得以替換新船一噸之造價而補助、津貼保息之事不與焉、若推之歐美、則英國有維持不定期船津貼、每年二百萬鎊、新船補助費、每年一千萬鎊、而復有免除船舶檢査等手續費之救濟、德國有每年二千萬馬克之專維航業費用、法國有五萬萬法郎長期低利借欵、意國有每年三萬萬呂拉之獎勵金、美國除對民營航業、年備二萬萬美金、專供航商借用、年息僅收三釐、航商尙在要求年息五毫之舉、而近來羅斯福總統之咨請國會年撥三千萬美金、以津貼航業、其他腦芬葡西各國、均有獎勵或津貼、重視優待、無微不至、無怪其蓬蓬勃勃、日增發展也、我國約法雖有獎勵及保護民營航業之文、而無行施之惠、加以金融界對於輪船押款向不收受、況當此存亡危急之秋、政府對於核准有案之航業公債、始終不予發行、是航商所仰求政府急施救濟之一綫生機、已告絕望、此困難之點五也、</p>
<p>垂絕民航仰荷成全</p>
<p>航商處境、旣有上述各點之困難、加以目前營業、益見衰頽、現狀難維、實已陷於絕境、若再坐視不拔、則民營航業、必致崩潰至無可收拾、職會爲航商團體、見聞確切、自屬難安緘默、無如迭向政府請命、迄無以應、徬徨瞻顧、莫展一籌、茲因憂慮結中、迫不得已、呼籲於鈞會之前、懇乞賜予援救、俾使垂絕民航、得有來蘇之慶、仰荷成全、實不僅航商銘感已也、爲此備文呈請、仰祈鑒核俯准施行、無任惶悚待命之至、謹呈、中國國民黨中央執行委員會第六次全體會議、上海市輪船業同業公會常務委員主席虞和德、</p>

<h3>電話專家委員報告書後補充各點</h3>
<p>按具收費辦法倘須繼續　商用家用話費增加程度</p>
<p>工部局電話專家特別委員會電話問題報吿書後附帶書、茲已提出、昨日曾由工部局公用委員會加以討論、各專家向董事會提出該附帶書時、聲明上月二十八日公用委員會開會時、曾面請各專家對於調査電話事宜職權範圍第三節詢問事項、予以答復、茲已照辦、至前此在總報告書中所以不予置答之原因、則已於總報告書第一頁中說明之矣云云、茲復將該附帶書之原文、譯錄如下、職權範圍第三節載、倘按具收費辦法、仍予維持、則（一）商用電話、（二）家用電話、及（三）其他各項之價目、應各增加若干、查接具收費制之價目表、其逐步取得之辦法、正與總報吿書第十五頁（公報　六二二及六二三二頁）中詳載者相同、據上述之記載、公司營利資本之純利、在本年年終、恐將降爲百分之八六二、再則至本年年終、話機總數之减少、恐亦將達四百具之譜、故翌年公司在此項話機租費上之收支、亦必較本年爲低、此外則本年投資之支出旣已增加、自明年一月一日起、應提存之折舊、亦必略見加增也、（公報第六一四頁第二段）現欲規定按具收費辦法之價目、求其能與報吿書所載月費十一元、及七元相抵者、則商用電話、每月須付十五元五角、住宅電話、每月須付九元二角五分、而現在按次付費之用戶、此後應以每月十一元、通話一百五十次計算、桌機附加費應增至一元五角、分機費應增至二元、吾等在總報吿書中、已詳論按具收費辦法如何不適宜於上海之理由、吾等深信此種辦法、此後若繼續行之話機之數目、亦必日益减少、並據吾人所知、現有許多較小用戶、預計將來按次收費辦法、勢將實行、至今尙未取消其電話、但一日按次收費辦法中止施行、彼等恐亦即將停止其電話、吾等前此對於按次收費辦法之主張、不僅在保留現有之用戶、並在吸引未來之新用戶、因其中小用戶覺新行價格、較舊有者低廉也、因此吾等對於擬具按具收費價目之請求、於答覆時所能言者、即吾等非但不主張沿用按具收費辦法、且在其反面、不得不毅然指斥其非、</p>

<h3>橡膠工業參觀記——正泰橡膠廠——</h3>
<p>— 婁立齋</p>
<p>橡膠工業在我國，不但是新興工業之一，且爲年來發展最速的工業，我國最初經營這項工業的都在廣州，後來上海也有人經營，而發展的速度反超過了廣州民國八年，上海有中華橡膠廠，製造鞋底，這是上海有橡膠工業的開始，不過該廠僅開設一年，就因虧本停歇，此後，江灣模範工廠等相繼設立，由製造鞋底而進製套鞋，風起雲湧，盛極一時，到民國二十年，更爲發達，全市有橡膠工廠四十八家，資本約共四百萬元，工人一萬二千名，出品總値達一千萬元以上，這是過去上海橡膠工業的最盛時代，可是好景不長，一二八淞滬戰爭爆發，一部份工廠被燬，生產力减退，外貨乘機傾銷，侵奪國貨市塲，戰後，市况蕭條，銷路呆滯，流動資本週轉不靈，因而相繼倒閉停工的很多，民國二十二年以後，更爲衰落，大有江河日下之勢，至去年上半年，其能維持開工的僅十餘家了，到十一月間，因停工倒閉的過多，出品减少，求過於供，市塲漸漸活躍，於是停工各廠，又復相繼開工，前途似尙樂觀。</p>
<p>九月三十日下午二時，我們一行五人，到正泰橡膠廠去，參觀橡膠工業，承該廠楊少振·和洪福眉·兩先生熱忱招待，首先吿訴我們該廠的歷史，、</p>
<p>該廠於民國十五年成立，廠址在塘山路，專製大喜牌套鞋，後受盤義昌橡膠廠，那時義昌所產的萬年靑·三八牌、套鞋，仍由他們繼續生產，繼因營業發達，塘山路工廠不敷應用，就在大連灣路增設第二廠，稱塘山路原有的工廠爲第一廠，民國二十二年二月，第一廠因走電被燬，生財存貨損失達二十萬元，營業上的損失，尙不在內，誠是該廠的浩刦，此後就第二廠擴充範圍，盡力整頓，設備方面，更求安全穩妥，生產方面，因那時套鞋的銷路已漸呆滯，便减少產量，停製萬年靑和三八牌套鞋，而增製回力球鞋，以和舶來品Redo籃球鞋相競爭，最近更增製萬里鞋，「萬里」是用以形容鞋的堅固，甚言其穿了雖行萬里也不破的，該廠災後，經這樣的整頓以後，現在始漸復舊觀。</p>
<p>楊先生和洪先生講完了該廠的歷史，就領導我們去參觀生產的過程。</p>
<p>套鞋·回力球鞋·和萬里鞋·的主要原料是樹膠，樹膠是用橡樹的脂做成的，橡樹產在熱帶，我國祇有瓊崖出產，但數量很少，且未經開發，故各橡膠廠所用的橡膠，都從外洋購來，該廠所用的是從新加坡購來的。</p>
<p>把購來的橡膠，加入石灰·炭酸鎂·和亞鉛華等混成的白粉，硫黃及其他有機性的促進劑，用熱和壓力使它混和，製成熱橡膠，這種橡膠，又分做厚藍兩種，前者是做鞋底用的，後者是做鞋面用的。</p>
<p>製套鞋，祇要把這厚薄兩種橡皮，黏上來裏，劃成鞋底鞋面，把底面膠在一起，再上光烘乾，便算完工，至於回力球鞋和萬里鞋，就比較複雜，須把鞋面的裏面，分別黏在薄的橡膠的兩面，製成鞋面，把厚的橡膠用電刀劃成鞋底，再把底面膠在一起，在蒸缸間裏烘幹了，才算完工。（未完）</p>

<h3>沙灣的傍晚</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>沒有預想到要在香港停留，勉強的滯住使人起固執的煩燥。雖然是剛剛從不滿十家鄉村中出來，對於孤寂該已相當習慣，但在有幾十萬居人的都市裏，却總不能用寗靜騙過自己的寂寞。在路上看見路人互相打招呼，乃至或者並非打招呼的相視一笑，都覺有點嫉妬。出去散步時每每都是感觸地重又闌珊跑回去，可是不久就又跑出去行街，心上總想或者能碰到一個認識的人，演一下他鄉遇故知的喜劇。這期望多少是可能的，經過梧州時曾聽說誰已去香港，誰還不久再要去。在聽說時，因爲這些人我都不很熟，在忽促的經過中，我當然不會去訪問，所以並不怎樣留心，這時却不免失悔了。其實就當時留意了，按地址特別去訪問，也是頗嫌兀突的，還是希望在路上碰到，可以隨便應酬。眞是他們見到也只淡淡地招呼一下，我就只有仍回去守我的孤寂。所以當時雖一面急切想遇到相識，一面也担心着希望被事實消毁。</p>
<p>坐渡船去消磨時間，已經成了我日常生活的習慣法。四分錢的船費，載行四五十分鐘的航程，幷且可以恢復躑躅很久以後的疲勞，讓我到對岸好再開始一新的躑躅。在香港的滯留中，我消磨在對岸九龍的時間，耍遠比消磨在香港的爲多。九龍的整齊的道路，比香港易認識，而且沒有洶湧的行人，有時甚至冷淸淸地，比較更適合我當時的心境。彌敎道和愛華德太子路，我都不知道走過多少遍。因爲我如是由深水浦渡來，一定從這兩條路走到九龍城渡回，由九龍城渡來，就一顚倒。渡船加上行路，每每是一個下午。是九龍城上岸甲的一次，因爲折到宋王臺吿玩，不覺勾留了很久，怕走到深水浦太晚，就坐了道車去，這樣就又比往常到時略早，因還不願就回香港，便在碼頭上看人網魚。這網魚者隨時做着買賣，共方式也很奇特，因爲每網是都不會落空的，遂定下每網打上的魚的，都是賣一先錢，誰先付了錢，這打上了的魚就給誰，多寡不論。如此，購買者就在這一先錢上，也可碰碰他的幸運，我可說楚爲這賭博的趣味所誘惑了，也化了一先錢，而我居然很幸運，得到空前之多，於是我遂爲其他購買者所欣羨，談論，這頗使我覺得我在他們中間可以不算一個生份的人了。</p>
<p>但這忽然的不生份却逐漸使我發窘。我這時是包取了我的幸運走的，而我却對這一大堆小魚無辦法，我本來沒有裝取他的東西，於是有人給我一張報紙，然而我包起他來帶到那裏去？所以我拿着報紙仍是對着小魚發怔。這樣我這時的行動，就比網魚者的網中魚更成爲注意的中心，我覺得四圍的人逐漸多起來，或者甚至圍外的人竟覺這圍內出了什麽花樣。　眞希望這些從海裏網上的魚可以回到海裏去，但我發眞推下去　要更引起　異的，於是我遂逼　非包納這幸運不可。幸運到底幸運，就這時我碰到熟人。</p>
<p>是C女士，剛坐了渡船回來，確竟是因爲這裏圍着人才來一看，到看見是我，竟忍不住驚叫了。記不得她當時是怎樣驚問了，我却趁答話的機會，立起來逃出人圍，招呼着C走開。我不知那堆魚到底怎樣結束，恐怕這小小的怪事，總還有人記憶着。</p>
<p>C是我的朋友的學生，以前沒有見過幾次，但她似以這樣熱悉以上的態度招呼我，援來知道是因爲我的朋友常提到我的綠故。不知道我的朋友，把上海的無聊而又混亂的學校生涯，對她們描繪得如何生動燦爛。內地的學生，往往把上海看作一理想世界，景仰着現代的都市，憎惡着內地，時時尋着向都市跑的機會，能到上海固然好，不能也想到廣州香港。這虛幻的理想，往往改變一個人的性格，使他在內地實在也無法住下，就沒有走的機會也得走，自然這樣夢也就往往幻滅，而幻滅也未嘗不是幸運，但正在幻滅時怕總是痛苦的。</p>
<p>C的生活狀况，不知道是她以爲我知道，抑或是她不願多說，只略略提到居在那裏，那時正是回去，因邀我去坐，但走到門前，忽轉念邀我同去看那路上提到那個居在長沙灣的朋友。雖然她那個朋友我幷不認識，因她的力說，剛剛在路上是答應了過一天同去看她的，忽然她改在當天，倒也想不出理由回絕。於是隨着她走向彌敦道去。</p>
<p>彌敦道和長沙路是連接着的，依一條橫路劃分，似沒有什麽特要的理由，大槪只因爲以下都是新開的處女地，還很少人姻。這長沙路我以前沒有走過，聽C講還是通往鄉間的大道。中途有一個灣是很好的游泳的地方。本可以去看看，但她的朋友住的地方很遠，所以得坐街車去。實在坐街車到終站援，還走了約二十分鐘才到她朋友的家。蒼茫的暮色裏，立着幾座衰老的屋子，C很熟悉地走上中間一座的扶梯，在二層樓的門口叫了一聲，裏面走出一憔悴中年婦人，C叫了她聲伯媽，就邀我同進去，那中年婦人雖注視了我一眼，却也沒有說什麽。過道上本立着一工人樣的靑年，見了人來，却一閃躲入後房，C的朋友還沒有出來，當C帶我走入前房時，看出她是顯然剛收拾完一伴零碎的事。</p>
<p>大槪她正耍向C詢問我是誰吧？C却先對我問道：「認識吧？」這一問却使我起恍惑，本來我知道的所訪是L女士的姊姊，但這時不能不懷疑是C故意捏造的話，而或實就是L自己，在容貌上我實在無法分別，因之我無法回答。C笑了，這位L也笑了，同時她似乎悟到我是誰，她吿訴我她的名字，對我說聽她妹妹說我耍來看她，於是C又笑了起來。大槪她對於自己所弄的狡猾已感到滿足，就把遇見我的情形說明。她吿訴她由我可以知道我那朋友的近况，又說我對於塡築海岸的工程很具與味，所以順便也好帶我去看一看塡築工程。</p>
<p>大槪那被喚作伯媽的女人，正在援面張羅什麽，C到援面去阻止了，隨回來提議海岸邊散步一回。一出門，他就吿訴我，從前這屋就在海岸邊，現在外邊却更塡出幾百丈闊的陸地了。她對於塡築的經過和方法都很淸楚，但對於港政府的用意和辦法都也只能揣測。這使我約略測得她的環境，但我當面固不便問，就援來對C也沒有問起。不過C後來曾吿訴我那工人樣的男子，就是L的丈夫。他們的婚姻是從小就定下的，他們都不料L會終接受這件盲婚，結婚時的情形，她不知道，但她知道L現在幷不失悔與不安，她總覺得有點奇怪。當C講這些話時，完全改變了平時的活潑的態度，每說一個字似乎都帶着點痛苦。使我想C帶我去看L的家，或者是借L的家顯示她自己的。</p>
<p>雖然在沙灣的那個傍晚，各人都沒有說什麽關於自己的話，但正如記憶中的暮色一樣，留下的印象是很陰黯的。L女士的生活，簡直等於埋葬。他的妹妹後來由於不同的路徑，差不多成爲被崇拜的美人的偶像了。而姊姊恐怕永遠埋葬在沙灣吧。曾以偶然的機會再見到小L過，但在極度的忽促中，我竟沒有來得及問她的姊姊。而C女士却久已眞埋葬在地下，沙灣的風景還依舊嗎？</p>

<h3>東京美術秋展印象記</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>方洵</p>
<p>到了東京後，美術的秋展，已經像有惰性似的展開在我們的前面了。</p>
<p>美術的秋季，照例是以「帝展」爲中心的，但是今年却因為帝國美術院的改組爭執，决定了展期到明年，於是本來算是「在野」的「二科」展覽會就當了這一美術季的先鋒。在一個陰森得像初冬一般的下午，穿過了上野的森林，在不很雜沓的會場裏走了一轉，在這兒，請讓我僭越地引用一句海湼的話吧！「我想儘可能地避開對於技術上的長處和短處的批評，……我簡單地寫一點這些繪群的題材及其意義，也許比較的有意義地。（海湼：法闌西畫家）</p>
<p>講題材，好像有一家報紙的批評說本年「二科」的特徵是取材方面的比較的廣泛，除出定型的裸婦，靜物，近郊風景之外，漸次的開始了求「盡因」於市井生活的諸相，但是我要補充的是除出這種市井生活的諸相之外，和這「非常時」很相稱地日本的畫家們已經開始了「求　因于殖民地生活之諸相」！隨手可舉的例子如栗原信的「夏天的喇嘛塔」，「夏天的滿州」，藤井二郞的以北平爲背景的「織物工塲」，「賣菜」，山尾薰明的以南洋爲題材的一拿塔拉潑的女人」，田口省吾的「吸阿片之圖」（二幅），「看戲」，藤田嗣治的「北平的力士等等，這說明了日本的畫家們雖則和海湼（上述害）所說一樣的「很遠地和嚴肅的社會運動分開一，但是他們可還不曾「自認爲自己的協力的無用」（當然，這協力的方面，是和海湼所指明是正反對的）！第二，我們覺得歷來在二科很占優勢的想要美化這醜怪的世界，而在這美的裏面陶醉自己的超現實主義的作品，已經漸次的下火，而且，即使在他們的觀點，也已經很少有可注意的作品，同時，使我們覺得有興味的是這一流派的作家奇妙地還可以看出漸次的移行到實用美術的傾向。至於旣成的大家們，如正宗得三郞，高岡德太郞，宮本三郎，淸水刀根，…我們祇能說在技術益瑧圓熟，但是反面却也「漸次的失却了大胆和力量」！正宗氏的「波濤」，高岡氏的「婦人」，淸水氏的「睡着的母子」，都是本年度的傑作，但這也祇是用他們入神的筆融和色彩，眩惑了我們的眼睛，當然這些作品是不會給你以任何時代的脈動與感激的。　帶便講到，本年二科入選了很多中國作家的作品，尤其是彫刻部的金學成（三點）和蔣治民兩位的作品都博得了相當的好評，不過，當我經過第六室（彫刻）的時候，不知是什麽因緣，蔣治民先生的那座若干古風的沒有頭部的男子立像正陳列在渡邊義知「日本刀」的前面！這眞是一個偶合的諷嘲了。</p>

<h3>債（續）</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>疋和這一樣，我的債台也高高地築起，四面蔓延起來了。還是沒有那耐性來等這病慢慢磨去，我咀咒着自己的不健強的體子，在暗夜，在深宵。不願意把朋友們的也是不容易得來的金錢澆在病上，肥料粉對於一株已然爛了根的樹木有什麽用呢？</p>
<p>我的討債鬼便是我的性命。我已經不憐惜它，不挽留它，存着「死掉他」的心情了！</p>
<p>然而我竟喘過氣，復蘇了。</p>
<p>開始能够緩步，能够邁出門檻了，那一絲靑天對我是個陌生者，是個奇蹟。</p>
<p>朋友們用善意的微笑來祝賀我，在這時，猛地記起；我的責任來了！</p>
<p>還有未了的債務來了！雖然我不是不知好歹的賴皮，但眼前這一絲靑天一片雲又在我心葉上變暗了。</p>
<p>我工作，我又在大街小胡同蹀蹼。</p>
<p>在沒法中，當街白牆上的大「當」字勾住了我的無神的眼睛，我的救星！</p>
<p>不過，我沒有勇氣在那高櫃台上張望。</p>
<p>「還有什麼可賣的呢？」時常在翻着那兩隻無亂的箱籠，我計算着債還有多少，於是緊縮撙節，並且狠駡那五個月的病</p>
<p>同時却又想：有債可借總還是幸福的，這世界，正有着千千萬萬求貸無門的人，怨誰呢</p>
<p>債，救了人，也逼死人。人世的威脅在眼前擴大了。（完）</p>
<h3>兄妹祠</h3>
<p>— 吳讓三</p>
<p>廣東民間流傳着許多戀愛故事。在農民們底簡單的叙述裏，有些是悲慘而動人的。關於這，一個在各處鄉村和縣城流浪着的朋友劉禮知道很多，有一次，爲了鼓勵一對懦弱的戀人，他給他們講了「兄妹祠」。</p>
<p>平時，劉禮談到各地的風俗的時候，我能夠——幾乎是用手觸到，他對那些鄉村的人民的眞摯的愛。他底愛是廣大而普泛的。完全不掩飾自身的偏好，他愛着一切人，連聰明和愚蠢的界限都沒有。</p>
<p>故事是從西江沿岸的魚鼓崗那里發生的。</p>
<p>在那條村子底河邊，有一間兄妹祠。鄉民對牠非常地敬愛和誇耀。那兒祀奉着一對表兄妹，男的呌做　淸，女的呌做何明珠，都是本村的人。在三十年前，他們熱烈地互相愛戀着，而他們的父親却有着幾世的仇恨，時時存心破壞他們底幻夢。何明珠是女歌手中間的領袖，但在和她底情哥做了一次盡興的酣唱之後，就讓家裏的人禁閉起來了。</p>
<p>那時候村裏的大人們都變成惴惴不安，憂慮着會有什麽禍事；年輕伙子都變成瘋狂，因爲誰奪去了他們底偶像。姓虞的和姓何的都是有錢有勢的人家，都養着同樣多的打手，貯藏同樣多的檢械。</p>
<p>從黑暗裏傳出了驚人的消息，明珠第一次懷了孕了。明珠底父親在何祠召集了族人會議，他自己提議把明珠裝在豬籠裏浸下河底，他自已親手執行了這種酷刑。</p>
<p>虞明拒絕了一切的勸吿，一個人在河邊唱了三天三夜的哀歌然後用短劍刺殺了那殘酷的父親。爲了避免無辜的悲慘的械鬥，他找着明珠被溺死的地方，自己也沉下去了。沒有人敢下水去打撈他們，也沒有人看見過他們底浮屍，除了歌聲以外，他們不曾在魚鼓崗留下過一點痕迹。……故事是這樣結束了。</p>
<p>在聽故事的人中間，洗衣匠阿漢和阿喜以一種剛強的表情微笑着，他們在親暱的喜悅之中，和那兩個過去了的南蠻的自出的靈魂融和了。那對懦弱的戀人：男的猴子般的瘦小的臉興奮得非常鮮紅，目光混濁而飄閃，哀憐着自己的渺小。女的完全出了神，像已失了視覺和聽覺動都不動地麻痺了。</p>
<h3>Boileau論詩</h3>
<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>近來讀到一冊日譯本法國十七世紀詩人鮑羅的詩學，覺得頗有些警闢的處所。本來，這是一冊總亞里斯多德的詩學而產生的名著，這里所謂頗有些警闢的處所，不免有點失敬。但我的意思，是因爲那里有些話，大可以作現代中國新詩的針砭，說的非常警闢。大概任何古典書籍，叫人談了歡喜，一定有二個原因。其一是：「深獲我心。」一其二是：它能替讀者向「時風」刺謬。我歡喜這冊詩學，就是第二個原因。詩學里所表現的鮑羅的思想，日譯本解說里有一段很好的說明，現在節譯如：</p>
<p>「這書一共有四篇。一半是論一般的敎訓（第一篇，論文學的敎訓，第四篇論道德的敎訓。）一半是詩的樣式論。（第三篇論叙事詩，悲劇，喜劇三大樣式樣式。知一篇論各種短形的詩）除可作令篇的序論看的第一篇最初二節論述天才外，全體　徹着一個精神。這一種精神是什麽呢？曰：理性之尊重。先從第一篇看，全篇二百餘行的着眼處，即是如次二行詩句，「…愛理性呵！諸君的著作應該常常從理性借得它的光輝與面　纔好。」（第三節）這以下約七十行（到十節止）都是敷陳他的理性的敎條。避免搜求珍奇的思想，避免陷於冗浸，避免文體的單調，尊重溫雅的趣味，注意詩的形熊；這些，是他的大要。……可是到底鮑羅所說的理性（也可呌良識）是怎麽個東西呢，在此我們應該想到笛卡爾底哲　及於鮑羅底美學的影響。例如鮑　常常說：置之外無美。一這就全是笛卡　的想法。因爲笛卡爾說過美是非個人的理性之一形式。然而鮑羅的理性，不是笛卡爾般純粹的理性。這是近代進步的笛卡爾的理性與文藝復興以來傳統的膽怯的古代尊重思想相混和的。……本來不過是一個有潔癖的市民鮑羅，像笛卡爾那麼個崇高的理性與精神的獨立性，是不得有的。他的理性，多少是疑慮的謙遜的。他是與其愛奔放的詩風與幽玄的詩美，寗可愛典雅而端正的詩品的。……鮑羅把理性別名良識（即很好的判斷力的意思）他止如笛卡兒一般以良識爲一世上頂好的分配者」，在這良識的名義下，他力說藝術之自然與素樸，完美與勻整，力說古代的模傲。這說法是全佛蘭西古典主義的說法。他底功績，是在把文　思想與笛卡爾的舉說相結合，給予它哲學的根底，再加強古典主義的基礎以便於傳播這一點上……」</p>
<p>這一節說明，給我們二個印欺。鮑維在文藝內容上是要求理性的充實的。在其形式上，又是個古典主義者。這樣的一冊詩論，一定會被人有作太方巾氣了的。也許有人會說他是洋載道派。但實際上呢，我在看不懂　人所作那　印象派的詩的時候，却也情願唸唸　道派如杜甫等人的古詩。除却形式不講，我覺得就是內容也比較來的結實。至少那些人是很深切地歷練過人生的。我是不大懂得靈感的。如其靈感可解作　詩人對於事物的感應。那麽詩人總當有個去感應事物的個性。個性大槪是意識（也許可說是理性）的表現吧。那麽鮑雜的話，也有着落。而對於主張作　　然的　詩的詩人，也不無補益吧。他說：「無論你採有趣的詩題，崇高的詩題或任何詩題，務使良識常與韻相協和。這兩者看來雖然相互排他的，但韻是從僕。……在理性之軛下，韻即唯唯諾諾屈身了。……諸君愛理性呵！諸君之著作，要常從理性借取他的光輝興面目纔好。許多世人，全因爲長着一分沒分別的血氣，常與正識相遠的彼方求自己詩思。在那怪奇的詩中所盛的思想，若說是他人想得到的思想，他們便以爲是損失自己名譽的。我們可不要陷入這般的極端的外道哪。」他又說：「恐怕一種缺點，反而陷入大缺點里，那是常常會有的事。比如爲了某一句力量太弱，反而弄得生硬，爲避冗長，反而文意不明。」這些雖則都是十分普通的常識，但也是最不易做到的事，同時，他還說到作詩須大衆化。在第七節里，他說：「要是希望大衆愛好呢，寫東西時，應把那調子不時予以變化。詩體過於平板，或常是單調的，它雖如何燦然，也還是沒用的。一定會叫讀者入眠的。」他又晚：一在詩中，能以輕和之聲從嚴肅移行到優和，從滑稽移行到峻嚴，那樣的詩人，是有幸的。那樣人的著作，是爲天所愛，也爲讀者所愛的。一他頂討厭那些以作詩爲遊戲的人。他說：「無論寫什麽東西，千萬不要陷於下品。就是卑俗的風體詩，也還有相當的品格。祇有厚臉的戲作者，他蔑視良識，首先是欺罔別人眼睛，以珍奇而玩世。此後，世人祇見卑野的挿　，詩作上所特訐的文法的破格，也已經完全沒有限制了。一他在這里赴將矯揉浩作興卑野　視的。他要求於詩人的是合理。合理的，便是真實的。他在第三篇，第五節里說：「不實在的車物，决不能爲觀客所看到的。固然，有時，真實的事，看來像不眞實的塲合也有。但是不合理的奇怪事，對我總沒有什麼魁力的。人是不會對那連自己也不以爲實在的事理而感動的。」</p>
<p>統觀他底詩論，大致總不出以下幾點。一，詩須從理性出發，守道德敎訓，母敎人爲惡。如為四篇，他呌着：「作家諸君呀，請聽予之垂訓。諸君如以豐富的想象力寫出作品，欲叫人人愛讀，則諸君之詩應富有很好的敎訓常常把堅實有用與愉快相伴。」「在作品中所描出的諸君底心與行爲，應表現出諸君品格高尙的姿態呵。如在詩里不知羞恥，沒却名譽，罪惡深重地寫着違反善德的事，使讀者起了親近惡德的心情，那樣危險的作家余全不重視。」故即對於詩中的靈感，他也以爲必須有良識與讀書爲根底的。（見第三篇二十六節）其二，詩須有整然的形式，鏗鏘的音節。他在第二篇里，完全是論詩的形式的。同時他還說：「巧妙地選擇諧調的單語，不是不可能的。任何充實的詩句，高尙的詩思，不能悅耳的，總不討人歡喜。」其三，在詩作的氣分上，他是主張與其憂　的，寗可快活的。他說…「作品中的一切，要有陽氣呵！做那莊嚴的同時而又快活的詩，不是不可能的。我對於無論如何崇高但到處顯出抑　苦重的詩，是討嫌的。」</p>
<p>這些論議，雖然已經是十分舊了的，但我總覺得對於現在中國過分炫奇耀新以平凡爲可恥的詩作，却可當作公正的批評着的。我們冉聽一聽他的話作結吧：「放膽的詩人底心，儘有陶然彷徨於夢勾恍惚之境的時候，自己不禁打破了煩襟的格律。然而出了格却敎諸君再很好地入格的，實在是如上所述的批評家呢。」</p>

<h3>規定本市輔幣價格</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>本市日來一方因謠言紛紜，投機份子大事操縱，一方因財政部頒布緊急法令，實行新貨幣政策，致各貨相繼狂漲。卽幣制中的輔幣如角子銅元，亦莫不大漲特漲。銀元兌價，在兩星期前，每洋一元，可換銀角十二角四百文左右，銅元亦至三千四百二十文。最近兩屋期，則銀角上下在十二角二百至三百文之間，銅元盤旋在三百四五十文左右。及至近日，忽然大跌。每洋一元，易銀角最大爲十二角，最小爲十角二百四十文，銅元最大爲三千文，最小爲二千八百文。以故一時市面，頓呈混亂。這影響於市民賣買，十分重大。</p>
<p>本市輔幣，平時漲落不定。卽同一日內，銀洋兌價，各姻兌店，亦復彼此不一。一逢特殊事情發生，更覺不能安定。如近日狀况，角子銅元的飛漲，雖自有其所以飛漲的原因，但投機份子的從中操縱，亦有以致之。卽烟兌店，亦一乘機居奇，隨時增减。這不但在銀洋兌換上，易起糾紛，卽市民生活，亦受甚大影響。幾個月來，銀洋兌價的高漲，一般經營小本生意者，因售物槪以小洋計算，莫不叫苦連天。及至近日，銀洋突然狂跌，且每洋跌至一角之多。這又足以影響居民的生活。</p>
<p>對於這種市面恐慌，如何設法安定洋價，銀錢業必須加以一番考慮。聞昨日錢業市塲，已發出通吿，謂奉財長面諭，自本月四日起，輔幣價格，每本位幣一元，祇准兌換十二角，以援均照這價格兌換，不增不减。這辦法是極善的。但錢業市塲雖有這規定。以後各姻兌店能否一致實行，還是値得注意的。至本市輔幣，若能因這次的變動，而漸趨於安定，實爲我們的希望。</p>
<h3>隣家</h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>市簍嫂那家人：大小四五個兒子的爭吵打鬧，男人的粗莽兇暴，和市簍嫂她自己的曉舌根子嚕囌，潑悍，一夥子合在一起，簡直成爲一窩蜂那麽自早及晚，不繼地喧擾着鄰舍的人們。</p>
<p>他們父子母女一大羣，都好像前輩子結下來的孽障，現在打在一堆互相索怨債的。碰着面總是沒好嘴臉，丈夫是個做粗活的下作人，滿身子野蠻勁兒，一開口便是「你娘你媽拉巴子，戳你祖宗」地，什麽穢猥的字眼全一古腦吐出來。可是市簍嫂並不是薄弱傢伙，儘讓男子去駡，閉着嘴巴不敢回響。男子擺牛勁子，她也一樣拿出強硬口氣抬扛。</p>
<p>「雜種子，沒好死塲的，動不動便臊人家的宗祖這是什麽話。」</p>
<p>「娼窩子，狗入的，誰叫你跟老子不値一文的賤貨，倒了霉，你還敢說你好出身，天曉得。」</p>
<p>市簍嫂是頂怕人提起那回事的，因爲她剛在二年前死去男人，眼前這男人是軋姘頭弄上的，而亦爲了這回事，隣居的人都看她做淫蕩娼，誰也瞧她不入眼。是的，別人用這個來奚落她，輕蔑她，她沒法的。但做丈夫的倒應該代遮住這點兒，然而市簍那混賬，偏是沒好心眼，天良滅盡，反而抓着做把柄似的，逢着拌嘴的時候便一五一十搬出來，</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>大加挖苦，更其是侮辱，市簍嫂到底還要顏面，雖然過去的劣行是藏不了，但有如丈夫那樣成心要觸她的傷疤，她却不得不冒火了。</p>
<p>「臭雜種，我是娼子，你就是烏龜，枉你亦說得。」</p>
<p>她額上的靑筋像蚯蚓一根根的暴漲起來，嗓子越提得高，如同打破鑼子的叫嚷着。</p>
<p>市簍那男人呢，的確是個鐵石心肝的漢子，他瞧見女人的模樣怎麽着，並不表示釘點兒憫憐或同情，而且跟着火性更騰上來，他獰着雙目，陰險地笑着；一邊一攢勁骨碌地冲過去，揪着女人的頭髪，恰如猛虎攫小兎一樣，接着脚呀手的亂揍起來，</p>
<p>市簍嫂跌倒在地，一行掙扎，一行咒詈，又一行啼呀哭的。</p>
<p>叫打的聲昔鬧出去，隣居一個個跑進來看把戲了。看着的人是無什麽感觸的，只是覺得有趣而已。又是這一套兒，這一套兒眞的不知演過多少趟了。</p>
<p>對於圍觀的人，市簍同樣是憎惡，沒好感的，他瞧見人越來越多，於是吼叱着：</p>
<p>「媽的，滾，這有甚看頭，王八羔子的孫子。」</p>
<p>看着的人都怒目瞅住他，沒趣地散去。</p>
<p>在隣人的心眼中，對市簍嫂第二次改嫁後的遭遇都是認爲活該的，因爲一個不守婦道的女人，自然沒好結煞。市簍嫂所受的苦楚正是天理，應有的責罰，何况那男子早便是不是東西之流的人，他酗酒，闖事，賭博，許多凡是閒蕩者的壞事他全有一手，而酒一喝下肚，便回到家裏找女人發洩出性子，儘够女人消受的。</p>
<p>爲什麽耍跟那末的惡棍呢，還不是自作自。</p>
<p>早時男人開一家專販竹筐市簍的店子，人家叫他市簍兄，女人也便是市簍嫂了。爲着市簍沒出息，糊像過日子，活計全不想做，店子關門好久了。伯以後便替莊稼人做短工。可是做短是有一定的時候，並非長年做下去。再加他惡名遠近都知，漸漸地弄得沒人敢雇用了　。</p>
<p>一家子六七口，活計當然更不易支撑，於是打架，鬧嚷，幾乎每日裏傳到村人的耳際去。</p>
<p>除他們倆一對尷尬夫妻，四個全在十歲上下的兒女都是市簍的前失養下，跟她一塊帶來的。</p>
<p>沒處想法的時候市簍把念頭轉到兒女身上了。</p>
<p>「那小鬼子賣掉，撈幾十塊再說。」</p>
<p>酒落下肚，男人是結實地說着。</p>
<p>「天呀，死你去的，什麽都吃盡，連兒子也想吃了。」</p>
<p>「誰是老子的兒子，鳥龜養的。」</p>
<p>女人無話可說，光有低頭淌眼淚。</p>
<p>給生計迫得無路可走，不賣兒子也只得賣。賣兒子過日，村中的人差點騷亂着，可是他們對外面的一切却全不理睬，繼着又是一個，而市簍嫂到像健產的母猪似的，隔一年便養一個兒子，養一個便吃落一個，到現在他們大約還在一邊養着一邊吃落着。</p>
<p>市箕嫂將來死後，準得打入十八層地獄，上刀山，入油鍋子受刑，老年人都這樣說。</p>
<h3>天氣感話</h3>
<p>— 胡思</p>
<p>風</p>
<p>昨夜接連地吹起大風，屋外的樹叢像暴雨般地響着，門窗不住地被吹得篤篤地做聲。望着窗外，天氣怪陰沈的，黑雲瀰邊在天上。路上寂無行人，街燈都黯淡無光了。一種無言的哀怨沈浸在心間，人間似乎怪無情味似的，生似乎有點厭倦了。</p>
<p>對於風，從來似乎不曾生起冷寂之感的。也曾遠飄過大海，海洋的巨風雖然怕人，也曾被困在舟中，平臥了三天三夜，却不　令我生起惡感。倒在風浪稍小的時候，掙扎起來眺望海景，看到浪濤滾着白花，覺到船身在海浪中跳躍，更是好看，因是反生起另一種快感來。在別的平坦的海行中，看海平如鏡，一點風絲都沒有，海中蚤無皺紋，會覺得全無意味，而對於海的與味和愛戀，倒因之减少了。</p>
<p>孩童時曾遭遇風的巨災。扷木倒屋，那時損失了人畜不少。海也嘯了，海水淹上陸地，衝倒了屋宇，漂沒了船舶；那風是大得可以把一個人吹走：從陸地吹向江河，或從屋頂吹落地下的。可是我幸而免羈於難。我只記得那時我們一家人都蓆地躺臥在堪固的木牀底下，母親緊緊地抱住我，似乎屋子被風吹倒時，我們也可被堅牢的牀板檔住而得救一般。那夜風聲凄厲，像鬼號，像野獸成羣在叫。屋樑時時必剝地在響着，而舊家一副堅厚的木門，被風撞得陣陣地在響。父親和母親面色灰白，像大禍將近臨頭般，時時發出顫聲的對話。我却被裹在被裏，受着母親的擁抱，倒覺得沒有什麽可怕，有時還會溫暖地熟睡一陣的。朝晨時風息，見郊外一片迷茫，有的樹折了，有的屋坍了，全是一片迷茫的灰白色的世界。雖然在童心里也會發生凄凉之感，倒也茫然地便把這印象放過了。</p>
<p>十年前曾寄宿在一個濱海的友人的家裏。那夜因爲老友們聚會，朋友們談得很爽快。大家喝了一點酒，面紅耳赤，天南地北，大說了一番。待到夜靜時，聽濤聲澎湃，大風從海上掃過。我們竟有興會提起手電簡去巡視海灘。看波浪直噴上海岸，幾乎把褲管的下綠濡濕了。大家看大海一片黑暗，而迷茫的夜色中却不住地泛起靑白色，都樂得歡笑和跳動起來。風對於我們少年人，想不到倒是這麼地喜愛！</p>
<p>南洋橋叢中的微風，却是更爲我所愛好了。在長日的炎熱的炙晒後，能够在叢林中歇一歇息，或在晚飯援散一散步，吹吹黃昏底風，聽馬來的情歌輕輕地從風中透過，是很爲愉快的。如果在海濱，那更妙了。海的風是鮮而甜的，能令人沈醉，也能令人做夢。這種海風的滋味，實在是在別的地方很難嘗到的。</p>
<p>所以風在我以往的生活中，是愛好的成分，比嫌惡的部分多的。可是人一過了中年，心情都覺變了。昨夜的大風，伴着我的失眠，竟令我整個夜晚都沈入陰沈沈的悶思中，活像陰晦的天氣一樣。不住地聽着風吼，不住地聽着樹葉搖擺的聲息，自己也挨着嘆氣，一種不能自解的煩悶與抑鬱伴着風聲擴大，心情像被巨風吹向茫漠的天空中一樣，不能自解。說天氣是能轉變人的心情的，我以前不信，而今却信了。然而對於生活所磨折去了的少年人的潑辣的活氣，我將因之感傷呢？還是慶幸人生經騐的有所獲得？</p>
<h3>虎</h3>
<p>— 吉彖</p>
<p>生活像一頭猛虎，它老是不息地張着大嘴，擺起搏噬的姿勢，眈眈地望着我，準備在「一千個小心中的一個不小心」的剎那間，用它底暴殘的利爪來撕碎我底胸膛，用它底粗糙如沙　的毛舌頭來吮盡我所有的血液。</p>
<p>不知道從什麽時候起，生活對我失掉了它底美麗，而盤據在我底周圍像一頭不息地窺伺着的猛獸了，而朝朝夜夜的，我戚到我是處身在僻無人姻的荒山裏，面對着那可怕的猛獸。</p>
<p>可是，猛獸就猛獸好啦！老虎也沒有什麽可怕呀；要生活，自己不是有的是年靑，有的是勇氣嗎？那個時侯（可是已經不知道是什麽時候了），我是那樣的像過的；於是，我對迎着我的猛虎開始微笑起來了—笑得那麼驕傲啊！像一個有把握的獵人，過分地自信他確能用了他底赤手空拳把這兇猛的畜生屈服下來，做自己的勞力的顯耀與獎勵似的—「初生之犢不畏虎」，不是有人那麽講過的嗎？</p>
<p>我說：「我是站在猛虎（假如生活眞是一頭猛虎的話）的前面了。我願意看一看它心樣地把人一片一片的撕開；我也願意看一看那沒有選擇的最後的結果：不是我殺死了它，便是它吞噬了我，它不是我的主人，便得是我的奴隸！」</p>
<p>於是，我看到了它底殘酷的搏噬的動作：於是，我也看到這絕對沒有調和的結果！那結果！我怕，我失掉了所有的思索的勇氣了。</p>
<p>是的，還思索什麽，還述說什麼呢？早晨與夜晚，呆呆地坐着，在鏡子中映着的是一付枯萎的形容，消瘦的，蒼白而陰沈的，像山谷中的卑地，笑的太陽是永遠不會照到的了——沈思，勞作，奔走，忍耐，多少年來，我用盡了所有的精力來對付那隻猛虎的利爪，它緊抓住了我，越來越緊：而我自己則越來越感覺到疲倦與衰乏了，我漸漸地開始感到它底力量—永遠是不斷地緊緾住我，威嚇着我；於是，一天天地，讓它底利爪挿進我底肉體中去、，讓它底粗糙的舌頭放到班班的創口上來：我得被它撕碎了，吮吸了的—一定的！—現在那最援的結果已經來到：那便是，生活的猛虎已經做了我底主人！一個喜歡把人的掙扎當作最好看的舞踏的，一個喜歡用別人的血液來當作甜美的紅酒之代用品的，無上的暴君了。</p>
<p>一聲聲的怒吼，不是够叫在生活的利爪下面的人打抖的嗎？生活可並不是一件小的事情，它是猛虎一樣的兇暴，大蟒一樣的緊纏着的可怕的東西。一夫天的人在它下面奔忙着：人疲勞了，人的笑朵兒消失了，人衰老了，人死亡了—悄悄地躺在地底下，可是身上與心頭，却帶了一簇永遠磨滅不去的猛虎的爪痕，班班的。</p>
<p>也許還有人以爲自己的年靑是驕傲的吧？是的，驕傲吧—當你一天天地在虎一般的生活的牙齒與爪鋒間生存下去的時候，你會哭的。</p>
<p>於今，從對生活的有把握的自信中，自己是留得了一生的猛獸的爪痕了。這像是烙過了一樣的永遠磨滅不去。我知道我總有一天是會被這猛虎撕裂成碎片而噬嚙着—而且，這日子一定不會很遠，一定不會很遠。</p>
<p>又一次地，我打抖起來了。</p>

<p>The County Magistrate Issue is Difficult to Resolve Immediately; Kobayashi Arrives in the County Town to Negotiate; Rioters in Yongqing County Incited by Ronin, Petitioned to the County Government and Were Dispersed</p>
<p>(Beiping) After discussions by relevant parties for several days, the Xianghe incident is expected to be resolved peacefully. The rebel people of Xianghe have raised three more demands: 1. Request compensation for the three poor people who sacrificed during the incident; 2. Request that the leaders of the poor people's movement not be punished; 3. The county magistrate be elected by the people. It is heard that the authorities have agreed to the first two demands, but the county magistrate issue must be appointed by the provincial government.

Otherwise, it would also be acceptable to transfer Lu Yinchang, the current county magistrate of Xiong County, as the county magistrate. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 5th, several hundred rioters in Yongqing County, incited by ronin, petitioned to the county government.

<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen plans to come to Tianjin from Beiping on the evening of the 7th to meet with Doihara and deal with the Tianjin-Dagukou Security Department. Regarding the Xianghe incident, he will discuss solutions again with Tada and Takeshita. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>

Councillor Chen was assigned to meet on his behalf, saying that the negotiations on this matter have a clue and are gradually entering the path of resolution, and it will be completely resolved within days.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Significance of Performance Appraisals for Civil Servants</h3>
<p>— Dou</p>
<p>The detailed rules for the implementation of performance appraisals have been passed by the Examination Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. The Ministry of Personnel is studying the steps for assessing civil servants in various regions, and it is expected that it can be implemented by the end of the year. Those who hold positions without merit will have no way to continue in their roles, and outstanding individuals will demonstrate their effectiveness even more. Is this not a more practical approach than relying solely on qualifications as the standard for selection?</p>
<p>In the past, those who sought official positions excelled at currying favor, forgetting that relying on connections was not legitimate. Therefore, when one person became successful, their relatives all celebrated their impending promotions. When one gained enlightenment in Huainan, even the chickens and dogs ascended to heaven. This had already become an established trend. Since the National Government strictly cracked down on this, to protect the employment of original personnel, those above and below understood each other and restrained themselves. Those who took office no longer had a large number of followers for unlimited transfers and promotions. However, powerful figures still often sent recommendation letters, and it was difficult to avoid the thought of using connections. The insertion of some individuals into positions was an expected phenomenon. In all fairness, the responsibility of an official is not light. Relying solely on one's own strength, one is deeply concerned about the difficulty of overseeing everything. They inevitably want to rely on trusted individuals to facilitate instructions. This is not only tolerated by human nature but also a necessary requirement for practical work. If those who are drawn from other places have the talent to respond to situations, they can be tried out. If they have no skills to offer, they should be ignored. Internal recommendations should not necessarily avoid relatives, and power cannot guarantee success. The principle of talent-based personnel management in one's department is the only principle for selecting officials.</p>
<p>Currently, occupational anxiety pervades the country, and those seeking employment are numerous. However, various agencies claim to be full and offer no room for flexibility. Considering the reality, among the large number of civil servants, very few actually work diligently. At least a portion are sitting idle and collecting large salaries without doing anything. These redundant personnel have mostly been heavily promoted and have powerful backing. Their qualifications are not necessarily outstanding, and they are often praised. However, they rely on their unique advantages and willingly sink into mediocrity, hindering the progress of others and causing the organization to stagnate. The impact is not limited to holding a position without contributing. Those in charge are also aware of the situation but are hindered by the difficulty of refusing requests based on personal connections. They feel frustrated by the lack of talent and resent the incompetence of their subordinates. On one hand, there are jobs that cannot be properly handled, and on the other hand, there are talented individuals seeking employment. However, useless and incompetent individuals are blocking the way, preventing them from approaching each other. For the public, this hinders the path of the talented. For oneself, it is a destruction of innate abilities. Speaking of discipline, there is neglect in rewarding and punishing. Discussing budgeting, there is concern about wasting national funds. Is this not a deeply regrettable situation? The implementation of the performance appraisal system aims to clarify the situation based on the facts, so that qualifications cannot be concealed and backing cannot be used for applications. The authorities do not have to compromise, and colleagues can avoid being suppressed. It is hoped that the Ministry of Personnel will implement this system effectively.</p>

<p>(London) Foreign sources are rumored that the British-Iranian Oil Company (i.e., the Anglo-Persian Oil Company), the Dutch Oil Company, and the Mobil Oil Company are currently discussing the possibility of stopping the shipment of kerosene to Italy. However, people in the London oil industry do not believe this, saying that the United States cannot even control its domestic oil market. Therefore, Mobil Oil Company does not seem prepared to stop exports to Italy and allow small independent oil companies in California and Texas to rise up and replace them. Then their position would be enough to eliminate the effect of the oil embargo. Political observers consider the chance of banning kerosene shipments to Italy to be very slim. They believe that the United States will never do this. The only way is for the major oil companies to negotiate an agreement, but judging from the phenomenon, the companies seem to have no intention of doing so. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

After the Italian vanguard retreated from the town, the Abyssinian army re-entered and appears to be preparing to resist. Fierce fighting is taking place southwest of Hozien, approximately thirty miles north of Makale. Two Italian officers were wounded, two Italian colonial soldiers were killed, and ten were injured. Both sides engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with bayonets for a long time. The Abyssinian soldiers eventually fled, leaving many dead behind. This is the first time the Italian army has suffered casualties since adopting the new offensive. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome): According to news received here today from Asmara, an Italian regiment arrived in Makale last night. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Abyssinian authorities expect the Italian army to launch a major offensive on both the northern and southern fronts. Although the current Italian advance is not very rapid, officials have acknowledged that the vanguard of the Italian army has reached the vicinity of the city of Makale. The city is about to be subjected to a large-scale attack. On the forward line in the Wogga Dan area, the weather has cleared, making military operations more convenient. The Abyssinian military preparations are actively underway, and a large number of foreign munitions will soon arrive. It is generally expected that in mid-November, the Italian and Abyssinian armies will have a major battle. The purpose is to seize several important strategic locations, or even to determine the outcome of the war in the middle of this month. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Stalemate in Anglo-Italian Negotiations</h3>
<p>Easing the Mediterranean Situation; Further Talks at an Appropriate Time</p>
<p>(London): The Cabinet today thoroughly considered the report from British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Eric Drummond, regarding his talks with Mussolini yesterday. It was decided that further discussions are needed before a concrete plan to end the tense situation between Britain and Italy can be determined. However, it is generally felt that some progress has been made towards establishing mutual goodwill. It is said that the tension between Britain and Italy and the situation in the Mediterranean are merely offshoots of the larger issue of ending the Italian-Abyssinian War. The talks between the British Ambassador to Italy and the Italian Prime Minister are still in the preliminary stages. Because both sides desire to achieve satisfactory progress, they will continue to meet when appropriate opportunities arise. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome): Prime Minister Mussolini has held repeated talks with the British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Eric Drummond. According to responsible sources here, these talks have not resulted in any solution to the situation between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris): French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval today again attempted to mediate the Mediterranean crisis between Britain and Italy. Laval met separately with Italian Ambassador Cerruti and British Ambassador Clerk. It is reported that the Mediterranean issue was the most important topic discussed, but the content of the talks was not released. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Predictions for the British General Election</h3>
<p>(London): The general election campaign is now entering its final week. Judging by the current situation, the current government will still hold a majority of seats in Parliament. The Reuters parliamentary correspondent predicts the chances of the three major parties in the November 14th vote, stating his impressions as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Government party is confident of winning a majority. 2. The Labour party also admits that it would be very lucky to win. 3. The Liberal party is deeply concerned that the number of Liberal seats, already few, may continue to decline. The correspondent also stated that the reason for holding this election early is the result of the Abyssinian war. When Parliament adjourned for the summer recess in July, the government did not want to go to the people before next spring. At that time, the government had just been reorganized and deeply desired to wait a while to present concrete reasons regarding domestic policy to request the nation to grant it power. Several months ago, the current government was not absolutely secure. The opposition parties, taking advantage of the difficult unemployment situation and the government's calls to increase national defense forces, lobbied voters, which was quite unfavorable to the government. However, the Italian-Abyssinian conflict broke out, and the British government maintained peace and was regarded as the leader in Geneva. As a result, the most powerful tool used by the opposition parties to attack the government no longer existed. Because advocating for military preparations to defend peace, the government was supported by the opposition parties within a few weeks. As the election date approached, the position of the Labour and Liberal parties was not as good as before. All of their main tools used to attack the government were no more than the following five points: (1) The government is now taking advantage of the international situation to rush through its hoped-for winning election. (2) The government still has warmongering views and argues that the current situation shows that British military preparedness is insufficient, which is very dangerous, and will propose expanding military preparations if it regains power in the future. (3) The government is indecisive. If it had acted earlier in Geneva, the current crisis would not have occurred. (4) The government is implementing the Ottawa policy, which is economic imperialism, otherwise the current crisis would not have occurred. (5) The government's policy of relieving unemployment has failed. In normal times, this kind of tool used by the opposition parties would be enough to endanger the government's security. Industrial areas may favor the hardship of unemployment and disregard the Geneva peace talks during the election, and London has shown a tendency towards the Labour party in the recent city elections. However, international and domestic circumstances have made the government able to control the odds of winning. Supporters of the government believe that the government's policy of maintaining peace has received the support of the majority of organized labor, and the Liberal party also supports the government's measures in Geneva. Moreover, if the League of Nations fails, there will be all kinds of terrible possibilities for war. Therefore, the people must again grant the government great power before Christmas to help its prestige. Moreover, the government has promised (1) that if the League of Nations remains an effective organization, the United States will continue to support it; (2) to make the country fully prepared; (3) to propose new measures to relieve unemployment; (4) to provide special relief to disaster areas; (5) to improve social services. Furthermore, the government, which previously opposed raising the age of children leaving school, is now willing to reconsider it. All of these points should be understood by the people.

<h3>London Naval Conference to Open on December 5th; British Military Experts Begin Discussions; U.S. Secretary of the Navy Advocates Expanding Naval Forces</h3>
<p>(London): Britain has proposed postponing the Naval Conference to December 5th. The conference will likely take a temporary break during Christmas and then reconvene early next year. The Italian representatives who arrived here yesterday have consulted with naval officials on naval limitation issues. It is understood that these discussions did not involve the current situation in the Mediterranean. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington): Secretary of the Navy Swanson stated today that he intends to maintain approximately 85% of the forces of all surface warships in peacetime, and the forces of submarines must be maintained in full. In the next budget, the Navy Department will recommend increasing the number of naval personnel to 100,000. As for whether the battleship Arkansas, which has exceeded its age, will be replaced by a new ship in 1937, this has not yet been decided. Swanson also stated that Secretary of War Dern, on his way back from the Philippines, will tour the key points of the Philippines, as well as Guam, Wake Island, Midway Island, and Honolulu, before returning to San Francisco in mid-December.</p>
<p>(Tokyo): The Ministry of Finance announced today that the expenses for Japan's participation in the London Naval Disarmament Conference will be 419,973 yuan. (Japan United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva): League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently forwarded a note from British Foreign Secretary Hoare to all member states of the League of Nations and the countries attending the Disarmament Conference. The note stated: "The governments of the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, which signed the Washington and London Naval Treaties, have accepted the invitation of the British government to participate in the London Naval Conference, which will open on December 5th. The purpose of the conference is to limit the navies of various countries and revise the new treaty to replace the Washington and London Naval Treaties, which will expire at the end of 1936. The British government hopes that after the signatory countries of the Washington and London Naval Treaties have established a naval agreement, it will immediately invite representatives of other naval powers to participate in the conference."

<h3>Shih Chao-chi's Speech: Promoting Sino-American Friendship</h3>
<p>Boston: Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shih Chao-chi delivered a speech to the China Society here today, stating that American goodwill towards China has promoted American trade with China since 1931 and has achieved the leading position of Britain and Japan, accounting for more than 22% of China's foreign trade. It increased to 26% in 1934, at which time Japan accounted for only 12.5% and Britain accounted for 12%. Americans have never taken advantage of China's crisis to seek selfish gains. We are very satisfied. American businessmen and manufacturers deeply know that goodwill is the key to trade. Americans spend huge sums of money annually to establish schools and hospitals in China, creating psychological factors of goodwill. This is purely out of charitable motives. However, it is also a fact that Chinese goodwill towards America promotes Sino-American trade. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome): According to news received by various newspapers here from Asmara, East Africa, it has been confirmed that the Abyssinian garrison of Makale has begun to withdraw. Italian aircraft flying over the city have discovered a white flag hanging in the central square, indicating surrender. At present, two vanguard teams of the Italian army have arrived under the city of Makale, but it is not expected that they will occupy it until tomorrow morning. After the Italian army captures Makale, it will continue to advance south to Lake Ashangi, 100 kilometers away, to place the entire province of Tigray under Italian control. A large force is currently advancing towards Makale, but is proceeding cautiously, fearing ambush by Abyssinian troops. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>International Financial Circles Pay Attention to the Dynamics of the Chinese Exchange Market</h3>
<p>No Change in British Policy towards China; Denies Establishment of Loan Between China and Britain</p>
<p>(London): International financial experts today are paying close attention to the dynamics of the foreign exchange markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong to judge whether China's nationalization of silver and currency management policies can succeed. In general, China's currency is currently quite stable, but it is generally believed here that this is due to British support. As for the real results, they cannot be seen until after a long period of time. However, since British merchant banks can assist, China's exchange rate with Britain and the United States should be able to maintain a stable price for a considerable period of time. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo): According to semi-official Japanese sources, British Ambassador to Japan Clive, when meeting with the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs today, firmly denied the claim that Britain had loaned China 10 million pounds. He also said that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, a British economic expert currently in China, has nothing to do with China's decision to nationalize silver. As far as the Chinese incident is concerned, Britain is willing to continue to exchange opinions with Japan on China's financial and political situation. In short, Britain does not want to have any history of changing its policy toward China. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo): Regarding China's currency reform, the meeting between Ambassador Arima and Minister Kong Xiangxi, as well as the talks between the British Ambassador to Japan and Vice Minister Shigemitsu, have clarified that there is no agreement between China and Britain to establish a loan or set up credit. At the same time, the British Ambassador to Japan stated that in the economic assistance of Britain to China, it will definitely respect the intention of Japan and cooperate with Japan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now understood the true intention of Britain. (Dentsu, 7th)</p>
<p>(London): Today's Times editorial stated that the Chinese government's financial and monetary reforms should receive the unanimous support of all countries that care about China's welfare. Unfortunately, the first reports transmitted to Tokyo immediately caused misunderstandings. In any case, it has been partially dispelled by the declaration that no British loan has been made and that Japan's rights have not been ignored. Japan must know that if China can reorganize its currency system through its own efforts, Japan can also benefit, no different from others. There are still many thorns in the road ahead, and China still needs all the support it can get to implement this reform. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington): A Washington Daily News political reporter, after inspecting silver-producing states, announced today that the U.S. silver purchase plan is disappointing everywhere. Comparing China's monetary contraction with the benefits promoted by those who support the government's silver policy, he said that even silver merchants across the country do not like this policy. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Controversy Over U.S. Silver Purchase Policy</h3>
<p>(Washington): It was heard today from well-informed sources that amid an atmosphere in which some people have doubts about China's ability to implement the national silver policy, the U.S. Treasury Department is now watching foreign developments and does not want to draw any conclusions about the final outcome arising from the U.S. silver policy. Although the U.S. government is closely watching the situation, it is not issuing criticisms. It appears that the question of whether the U.S. has driven China to adopt this policy has aroused behind-the-scenes controversy. Those who defend the U.S. government say that China's troubles are its internal affairs, while those who criticize the government say that the U.S. silver policy is responsible for China's steps. As of now, the U.S. government has not received any documents from American banks and other businessmen in China requesting assistance to protect their silver holdings. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(New York): The Bank Daily published a long article today ridiculing the government's silver policy, saying that the government's silver policy has not only failed to restore the monetary prestige of silver, but has harmed it. China's national silver policy is a response to this policy, and its impact has shattered illusions. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Organize International News Agency</h3>
<p>Minister Mochizuki Expresses Permission</p>
<p>(Tokyo): Japan plans to establish a large allied news agency to operate internationally and become the world's first-class news agency. The applicants have organized a corporation and have received approval from the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, the preparations were slightly delayed due to the sudden death of Tokonami. Now, because news agencies such as Reuters and Havas are very active in the Italian-Abyssinian War, and Japanese news agencies cannot compete with these major news agencies, it is even more necessary to establish one as soon as possible. Recently, Minister of Communications Mochizuki hosted the heads of national news and communication circles at his official residence. Those who attended included Minister of Communications Mochizuki, Vice Ministers Aoki and Ohashi, Councilor Hirano, Director of Telecommunications Bureau Shindo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu, and Director of the Intelligence Department Amau, etc., to discuss specific measures and urge their speedy implementation.

<h3>Scientific Musings</h3>
<p>—Edited by Li Yinkong and Ma Dapu of the Science Society of China</p>
<p>Forests and Human Life</p>
<p>On land, areas where trees that produce timber grow densely are called forests. The trees are called forest trees, and the land is called forest land. Therefore, a forest is actually the general term for forest trees and forest land.</p>
<p>In ancient times, the population was sparse, and almost the entire vast land was covered by forests. Therefore, forest products, both primary and secondary, could be taken without end and used inexhaustibly. This was the golden age of forests. Later, as the population increased, forest products gradually became insufficient to meet demand. As a result, nomadic herding and farming gradually developed. Forest land was reclaimed, and forest trees were consumed. This was the initial decline of forests. Furthermore, forests gradually decreased due to the development of agriculture, and humans, misunderstanding forests as useless objects that hindered reclamation, wantonly cut down and burned them, making it increasingly difficult to obtain timber. This was the gradual decline of forests. By the time people became wiser, and industry and commerce developed, the need for timber increased daily, and its uses became more widespread. Merchants then engaged in large-scale logging, leading to forest devastation, exposed mountains, and consequent impacts such as river blockage, mountain collapse, and climate imbalance, making people feel not only the timber shortage.</p>
<p>Forests were destroyed due to the increase in human population, as briefly described above. However, as human life depends on forests and the harm of forest depletion became apparent, the science of forest construction began to emerge. The relationship between forests and humans is divided into two categories, direct and indirect, as described below.</p>
<p>(1) Direct Relationship between Forests and Human Life</p>
<p>Producing timber is the main product of forests and an indispensable item in human life. Whether it is construction timber, transportation materials, or anything needed for our daily necessities, few can be made without timber. In recent years, with scientific progress, the use of timber has gradually expanded, such as decomposing timber into wood pulp for papermaking, weaving, and manufacturing rayon and artificial ivory, or dry-distilling timber to extract tar, wood vinegar, wood spirit, and acetone as industrial raw materials. Recently, timber has even been used as a raw material for making sugar and brewing wine. Therefore, the use of timber is expanding daily and is extremely important and significant to our clothing, food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>Providing Byproducts: In addition to timber as its main product, forests can also produce byproducts, such as paper made from mulberry bark, oil extracted from paulownia seeds, edible toon leaves, and rosin made from pine resin. Other valuable foods and medicines such as shiitake mushrooms, silver ear fungus, cinnamon, and magnolia bark are also products of trees. The birds and animals that inhabit the forest, and the edible fungi and undergrowth that grow on the forest floor, are also important byproducts of the forest.</p>
<p>Developing Capital and Accommodating Labor: Forests are a type of large enterprise and an important part of the national economy. Their capital includes forest trees and the forest land where they grow. Any land unsuitable for crop growth can be afforested. It is estimated that the world's forest area is about 7.5 billion acres. With such a vast area of forest land, the large amount of capital required each year for afforestation, harvesting, logging, and other work, and the manufacturing of its byproducts, and the large number of workers accommodated, can be imagined. It is reported that the United States recruited 300,000 unemployed unmarried young people in 1933 to engage in forestry work. The budget for that year was 250 million yuan. In addition, the central government's regular forestry budget was as much as US$36,325,323.</p>
<p>(2) Indirect Relationship between Forests and Human Life</p>
<p>Harmonizing Climate: According to experiments by experts from Europe and the United States, the temperature in forests is usually cooler during the day and warmer at night, cooler in summer and warmer in winter, compared to outside the forest. Because the forest floor is covered by tree crowns, sunlight cannot directly shine on the forest floor, so the heat of the sun is not easily penetrated. At night, the heat inside the forest is also difficult to dissipate due to the coverage of branches and leaves. Therefore, due to the gradual flow of air, the temperature inside the forest is harmonized, and the temperature near the forest is also affected, forming a mild forest climate. As for humidity, because forests can store a large amount of water, they are also higher than non-forested areas, which can increase the amount of rainfall in the area and reduce the harm of prolonged drought and prolonged rain. This is how forests harmonize the climate.</p>
<p>Conserving Water Sources: Because forests have lush trees, when it rains, rainwater first falls on the tree crowns and then slowly drips into the forest. As a result of the delayed flow of rainwater, in addition to the ground cover being able to absorb as much water as possible, a large amount of water can also penetrate into the ground, be absorbed and stored by the roots of trees, and slowly flow out. Therefore, even in prolonged droughts, there are constant springs near forests.</p>
<p>Protecting Soil: Because the roots of forest trees spread and extend, they can strengthen the binding force of the soil, so even the soil on sloping hillsides will not collapse due to rain. Moreover, the tree crowns of forests and the ground cover in the forest cover the ground, preventing it from being directly hit by rainwater. The rainfall slowly enters the forest through the tree crowns. In addition to being absorbed by the forest cover and penetrating into the soil, the amount of rainwater flowing out is small and slow, and there is no force to erode the soil. Therefore, there is no risk of denudation where there are forests.</p>
<p>Reducing Flood and Drought Disasters: The reasons for the formation of floods are nothing more than a sudden increase in water volume and river channel siltation. Since forests can conserve water sources, part of the rainfall is absorbed by the forest during heavy rain and prolonged rain, so the amount of water in rivers will not increase suddenly. Moreover, since forests can protect the soil, the water flowing out of the forest will not carry sand and soil to fill the riverbed. As for the causes of drought disasters, they are nothing more than a lack of rainfall and a lack of groundwater. Forests can increase the amount of rainfall and store a large amount of groundwater, which gradually flows into streams. Therefore, forests have considerable effectiveness in preventing floods and droughts.</p>
<p>Preventing Wind and Sand and Avalanches: On vast coasts or plains, if there are no forests to provide shelter, sand and soil will fly around during storms, harming people and property, which is very dangerous. If forests are lush, the expansion of tree branches and leaves will inevitably reduce the ability of wind and sand to move. If forests can be built on sandy land, the mechanical action of tree roots to settle soil and sand is the best strategy. For example, the Gascony region of France has 800,000 acres of land that is entirely a sandy area. Since 1810, this wind and sand prevention forest has been built and has now become the first forest area in France. Also, in cold mountainous areas, snow accumulates in winter and does not melt. When the weather warms in spring, the snow melts and moves down the mountain, damaging people's lives and property. If there are trees to provide shelter, the snow on the mountain will be supported by the trees and will not fall and cause avalanches.</p>
<p>Enhancing Scenery: Forests are an element that makes up scenery and have a unique aesthetic, so they can cultivate our temperament. Moreover, because the forest scene is solemn and quiet, the residents near the forest are also influenced by it and are rich in a spirit of courage and simplicity. Therefore, the ancients said that beautiful mountains and rivers produce great people, and also said that the heart is at ease in the mountains, which is the meaning of this.</p>
<p>Benefiting Hygiene: Air is an indispensable element in our lives, so whether the air is clean or not has a great impact on human life. Trees can separate oxygen through photosynthesis to meet human needs, and the forest contains a large amount of ozone, which can eliminate unclean gases, smoke, and harmful bacteria. Therefore, it is no coincidence that people living in the mountains are often healthy and long-lived.</p>
<p>Protecting Fishing and Hunting: Forests are the place where wild birds and animals live and feed. Without forests, birds and animals would have no place to rely on. Therefore, the relationship between forests and birds and animals is easily recognized by us. As for the relationship between forests and fish, the fruits and leaves that fall from the forest flow into rivers with the water, which is sufficient for fish to eat. The shadows of the forest cast on the water surface can be used for fish to rest. Moreover, forests can regulate the amount of water in rivers to prevent riverbeds from being buried, and can also promote the growth and reproduction of aquatic mosses, aquatic plants, and microorganisms, such as the genus Aponogeton distachyos, to provide food for fish. They can also regulate the temperature of rivers and prevent river water from carrying sand and mud, which is of no small benefit to fish health.</p>
<p>Improving Soil: Forests can transform low-lying and dry land into suitable production land. For example, in marshy areas, only the water needs to be drained once, and then suitable tree species can be planted to create a wetland forest. The evaporation of the tree crowns can make the moisture in the soil suitable. As for loose, dry, and barren sandy land, drought-resistant tree species or legumes can also be planted. The soil can also be improved by the action of fallen leaves, dead branches, and root nodules of legumes fixing nitrogen in the forest. For example, the coast of East Prussia in Germany was once a barren sandy area. After the government vigorously implemented afforestation, it has now become a source of productive benefits. The effectiveness of forest soil improvement can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Facilitating Navigation: With the development of modern navigation, lighthouses and buoys are installed in important harbors, islands, and capes to ensure the safety of waterways. However, in places without these targets, the shape of the land is often used as a standard. Forests are higher than the land and are actually the best navigation targets.</p>
<p>The importance of forests to human life has been described above. According to the Ministry of Industry, the area of wasteland suitable for forestry in our country is no less than 500 million mu, accounting for almost one-third of the total area of the country. How should we work hard to engage in afforestation and protect wild trees in this large area of wasteland to increase production, directly prevent our clothing, food, housing, and transportation from lacking raw materials, and indirectly ensure our safety in life?</p>

<h3>The Situation in Wuhan After the Implementation of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Commodity Prices Rise, Copper Coins Scarce; Authorities Order Strict Crackdown</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Since the 4th, upon receiving the order from the Ministry of Finance to implement legal tender, the market in Wuhan has been relatively stable. Various commercial banks, such as the Yanye (Salt Industry), Siming, Dalu (Continental), Nonggong (Agriculture and Industry), Guohuo (National Products), Nongshang (Agriculture and Commerce), Shangye (Commerce), Meifeng, Jin Cheng (Gold City), Shanghai, Shiye (Industry), Zhongnan (Central South), Tongshang (Trade), Nongmin (Farmer), Dafu, Dazhong (Great Central), Bianye (Border Industry), Juxingcheng, Zhejiang Xingye (Zhejiang Development), and Zhejiang Shiye (Zhejiang Industry) banks, as well as the Hubei Provincial Bank, have all complied with the order to submit detailed reports of their cash reserves and the amount of banknotes issued up to November 3rd. Foreign banks, such as Citibank of the United States and HSBC of the United Kingdom, are also accepting and disbursing legal tender. It is reported that the total silver reserves in the city are approximately 20 million yuan. The Central, China, and Communications Banks, in addition to accepting cash at their branches, are uniformly exchanging the silver reserves of various commercial banks for legal tender, which is expected to be completed within about a week. Today, the Central Bank headquarters transported several million yuan of legal tender to assist various banks in meeting withdrawals. The Bankers Association held an emergency meeting today and decided on six points: (1) Each bank shall prepare three separate tables listing in detail their cash, savings, and issuance reserves as of November 3rd, and submit them to the Bankers Association for forwarding to the Municipal Government and the Central Bank. The types of banknotes shall be classified as "Shen" banknotes, "Han" banknotes, and subsidiary currency notes, and the cash shall be classified as raw silver, silver dollars, and copper coins. If there are items held in trust for others, they shall be reported separately in accordance with the above procedures and submitted to the Association within seven days; (2) Hereafter, all bills and contracts issued by banks shall be written with the words "National Currency." Bills and contracts issued previously, as well as bills and contracts issued by customers hereafter, which still use words such as "Ocean Silver," "Silver Dollar," "Shen Banknote," and "Han Banknote," shall be regarded as National Currency and accepted using banknotes from the Central, China, and Communications Banks and banknotes approved by the Ministry of Finance for continued circulation by banks other than the three banks; (3) Once the inventory of each bank has been reported, if there is any exchange for legal tender thereafter, the inventory amount must be changed. The three banks shall prepare a two-part exchange certificate, with one part kept as a stub and the other given to the exchanger as proof. Before the exchange certificate is printed, a temporary slip shall be used as proof. For exchanges made in the previous two days, a receipt shall be issued retroactively; (4) Interbank accounts shall be consolidated into National Currency accounts, and interest shall be calculated up to the date of consolidation; (5) Due to the scarcity of copper coins in the market, the government is requested to prohibit imports and exports and stipulate the legal exchange rate; (6) The three banks should not limit the remittance of banknotes only to their own branches. The three banks shall accept all remittances using banknotes from the three banks and banknotes approved by the Ministry of Finance for continued circulation by banks other than the three banks. As for the Reserve Fund Custody Committee, there is no need for it in Wuhan at present, and the banking sector has not made any requests. The three banks have not yet considered handling real estate mortgages and will decide based on future developments. During this period of sudden implementation of legal tender, the Wuhan market is extremely panicked by two things: one is the rise in commodity prices, and the other is the lack of copper coins. The prices of various commodities are rising, especially the prices of food such as rice and flour, which are rising sharply, causing losses to the common people. The lack of copper coins is particularly difficult, and disputes arise from time to time in retail trade. Today, government officials and merchants held a special joint emergency meeting to discuss relief measures. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Huang Wenzhi, committee members Zhou Xingtang, Chen Jinghui, Zhu Yongzhai, Cao Yanxiang, Zhu Futian, Deng Xizhou, Bankers Association Chairman Wang Xipu Xinya, and Money Dealers Association Chairman Wang Xinfuli attended. It was resolved to prohibit the outflow of copper coins from the Wuhan urban area, and violators will be investigated and punished, and the copper coins will be confiscated. The legal price of copper coins will be permanently fixed at 6 strings of cash per National Currency yuan, and violators will be prosecuted for disrupting the financial order. Those who deliberately hoard large amounts and manipulate the market will be severely punished, and if necessary, 100-wen subsidiary currency will be printed for circulation. As for the increase in commodity prices, strict measures will also be taken. After the meeting, the Municipal Government issued a proclamation stating: "Regarding the matter of this currency reform and the centralization of reserves, we have forwarded the telegrams from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Ministry of Finance, and announced them to the public. Since the implementation in recent days, market transactions have been as usual, indicating that people from all walks of life thoroughly understand that this policy is a necessary measure to improve finance, save the nation, and preserve its existence. However, there are occasional cases of a few citizens raising commodity prices and hoarding copper coins, thinking that the centralization of cash is still the same as in 1926 and 1927. It must be known that the measures determined this time are completely different from those in 1926 and 1927. In 1926 and 1927, the centralization of cash in Wuhan was only limited to Wuhan, and cash was still used elsewhere. Even in Wuhan, foreigners refused to accept banknotes, so banknotes and cash formed two kinds of market prices, the paper currency depreciated, and commodity prices rose. Now that legal tender is implemented, the whole country is unified, and all foreign banks also comply with it, and the customs duties are standardized. People holding legal tender can exchange goods everywhere. In the past, the currency system was not unified, and those who remitted funds to various places had to pay a surcharge, but now they can all be used. Therefore, after the implementation of legal tender, commodity prices not only cannot rise but are also more balanced than before. In recent years, the domestic economy has been affected by silver externally and by major droughts and floods internally. The purchasing power of the people is weak, and the market is becoming increasingly sluggish. The increase in commodity prices depends on the existence of economic strength. With weak purchasing power, even if commodity prices are raised, there will be no market and losses will inevitably be incurred. At present, due to the initial misunderstanding of the legal tender policy, there is a rush to hoard goods, and commodity prices have risen as a result. It is important to know that this is only a temporary phenomenon. If hoarding continues, the market will be stable as usual, and commodity prices will eventually fall. Who will bear this loss? As for copper coins, they are a kind of subsidiary currency. If the price of legal tender is stable, how can subsidiary currency be raised independently? Knowing that hoarding is a foolish idea. As the mayor serving my hometown, it is my duty to send personnel to secretly investigate unscrupulous merchants who raise commodity prices and hoard copper coins, and severely punish them according to law at any time. It is necessary to issue a sincere proclamation to inform the public." Moreover, the Pacification Commissioner's Office ordered the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters and the Hankou Municipal Government to immediately consult with responsible personnel from the Chamber of Commerce to properly plan measures to restore the original state, stating: "After the implementation of the new currency policy, the economic situation in various places has been very stable. However, in Wuhan, a few merchants are taking the opportunity to profit, manipulating copper coins, purchasing goods with small banknotes, refusing to give change, and privately setting up dark markets to raise commodity prices. If this continues, the market and finance will stagnate, and the people's livelihood will become more difficult. The state's currency reform was originally intended to save the crisis and revive the economy, but the general public has not fully understood the truth, resulting in unscrupulous elements taking the opportunity to hoard goods. If this is not stopped immediately, it will undermine the currency system and affect public security. Considering the future, it is very dangerous. The said commander and mayor are instructed to immediately consult with responsible personnel from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce to properly plan measures and quickly restore the original state. If it is found that there is hoarding of copper coins, seeking to profit, and raising commodity prices while depreciating legal tender, they will be treated as crimes against the Republic of China. This matter concerns public security and is not trivial. It is ordered that the said commander and mayor handle it together and report back as necessary." (6th)</p>

<h3>Youth and the Nation (Part 2)</h3>
<p>(Lecture to secondary school students nationwide on October 29th and 31st)</p>
<p>Qian Duansheng, Professor at Central University</p>
<p>The third flaw of our nation is the pervasiveness of callousness. Callousness is related to selfishness. We Chinese people have an idiom that says "Mingzhe baoshen" (wise men protect themselves), and a couplet that says "Each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and cares not for the frost on his neighbor's roof." These can both describe the spirit with which a class of people conducts themselves in their dealings with others. I remember a few years ago, a Mr. Weng was traveling by car from Nanjing to Hangzhou when the car overturned, and Mr. Weng was seriously injured. After several tens of minutes, a car sped by, completely ignoring Mr. Weng, who was groaning and begging for help. This kind of callousness is extremely common in China. However, this shortcoming is enough to make our nation one that lacks initiative, courage, and unity.</p>
<p>Speaking of our country's land, it has both good and bad aspects. The good aspect is that our country has a vast area, and we have lands in the cold, temperate, and hot zones. But we must also be aware of our shortcomings. We often boast that our land is vast and abundant, but in reality, while our land is large, our resources are not abundant. Although we, the Soviet Union, and the United States are all large countries, in terms of surface products and underground deposits, our country cannot compare with the United States and the Soviet Union. Underground coal, iron, and oil, as well as above-ground forests, are all essential elements for modern wealthy and powerful countries, but our country's supply is not abundant. Even in terms of agricultural products, our country's output is lower than that of the two countries, and the United States does not often have floods or droughts, the Soviet Union rarely has floods or droughts, while floods and droughts are common occurrences in our country. The Yellow River's floods have persisted for thousands of years, and there has been no solution. The Yangtze River's floods were not common in the past, but in recent years, due to the siltation of the major lakes and the encroachment of local bullies and gentry on lakeside fields, the river water often overflows. Therefore, we must not be proud of our vast land and abundant resources. Our land is large, but our productivity is not. To enhance our country's position, we must work hard to prevent floods, promote afforestation, increase agricultural productivity, and invent substitutes for petroleum.</p>
<p>Speaking of sovereignty, we should be familiar with the history of how sovereignty has been violated in recent decades, as well as the process of losing sovereignty. As I just mentioned, sovereignty is one of the elements of an independent country. But in recent decades, foreign consular officials or judicial officials have enjoyed jurisdiction over trials on Chinese territory. Foreigners who commit crimes in China are not tried in Chinese courts, but in foreign offices. Foreigners also have the right to station troops in China. More recently, foreigners can undermine the integrity of our territory and the unity of administrative power; and can insist that we do something, or not allow us to do something else. This kind of infringement on sovereignty is enough to deprive our country of its independence and turn it into a semi-independent country.</p>
<p>Knowing the state of our people, land, and sovereignty is essential to understanding our country's loveliness, and also its worries. Our country has a large population, a great nation, and a vast area. This kind of country is worthy of our love, and we can be proud of it. But our nation has shortcomings, the land's resources are not abundant, and our sovereignty is not complete; these are truly worthy of our concern. Young people—your first task to the nation is to love and save the country, and you must strive to be familiar with everything about the nation. Only by understanding China can you love China; only by understanding China can you save China!</p>
<p>(II) Be a Good Citizen</p>
<p>The deeper the understanding of the country, the stronger the patriotism will naturally be. However, merely having strong patriotism is not enough to shoulder the great responsibility of saving the country. Young people must work harder to be good citizens, and strive to attain the cultivation of a citizen. As mentioned above, our nation has many major shortcomings. If the Chinese people are to progress and become better citizens, the young people who will be the future masters of the country should naturally aspire to be model citizens.</p>
<p>There are many conditions for being a good Chinese citizen, and a model citizen of the future. The following six are especially important:</p>
<p>First, young people should have a spirit of cooperation. The spirit of cooperation is what was formerly called the spirit of collectivity. The Chinese have always lacked this spirit. The inability of the Chinese to cooperate is evident everywhere. In the political sphere, political parties are not easy to develop in China, because the Chinese have always been "friends but not partisans." Political associations of a few people are easy to have, but common political life of many people is difficult. In the commercial sphere, sound company systems are also not easy to develop. It's not that the Chinese are incapable of doing business, but that they simply cannot cooperate in doing business. The reasons why the Chinese lack a spirit of cooperation are not simple. The lack of development of education is an important reason, but the biggest reasons are two: one is the lack of training in cooperation, and the other is the lack of a habit of obeying rules and believing in rules. Therefore, to cultivate a spirit of cooperation, one must have training in cooperation in youth, and must absolutely obey the rules.</p>
<p>Today's youth are receiving education in schools, and schools are the best place to train in cooperation. In schools, there are various meetings and various groups. The purpose of establishing these meetings and groups may be very simple and ordinary, but young people should not despise them. They should fully participate in activities, because in these seemingly purposeless meetings or groups, young people can most easily gain experience in collective life and training in cooperation. This experience and this training are the foundation of all future cooperation.</p>
<p>The spirit of adhering to rules is also a fundamental condition for cooperation among people. Without the spirit of adhering to rules, cooperation cannot have sustainability or a larger scale. The unity of a few people can still be maintained by emotion, but the union of many people must have rules that are commonly observed. To use political parties and companies as metaphors, for a political party to maintain its party organization and promote its platform, it relies entirely on its platform. The ability of party members to obey the party's rules is party discipline. If party members do not abide by party discipline, the party organization will inevitably be divided and the party's platform will be impossible to promote. For a company to maintain its position, shareholders must also absolutely abide by the company's articles of association. If shareholders refuse to follow certain articles of association and always plan for themselves, the company will inevitably decline or go bankrupt. If the prosperity of political parties and companies requires a spirit of adhering to rules, then all other group life even more requires this spirit. If the rules are prescribed in this way, we should do it in this way, even if it is unfavorable to ourselves, we should have a spirit of sacrifice; even if it hinders friendship and personal relations, we can only not show it. The Chinese people have always valued personal feelings most, which is fundamentally in conflict with the spirit of complying with laws and regulations. Young people should be warned in the county, otherwise the spirit of cooperation cannot be developed or cultivated.</p>
<p>Second, young people should have a martial spirit. Our Chinese nation is inherently peace-loving, and peace is also an excellent national characteristic. We should of course preserve it. Moreover, we want a world of universal harmony, and all the world's nations should advocate peace, but the world today is not a peaceful world, and our China is an oppressed country. These are all facts. The Premier strongly advocated universal harmony and pacifism, but he also argued that we should first strive for national equality. The reason why he has this view is because the Chinese nation, if it cannot achieve equality, can never stand up for the oppressed nations of the world. He said: "We oppressed nations must restore our nation's free and equal status before we are qualified to talk about cosmopolitanism." Cosmopolitanism here means universal harmony. I dare say: if we do not know martial arts and cannot defend ourselves, then there will absolutely be no place for our country in this world, let alone universal harmony.</p>
<p>The advocacy of a martial spirit in our country also has a history of thirty or forty years. Since China was defeated by Japan in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, a group of enlightened people have advocated martial arts. After Japan defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, people who had received a new education even more strongly advocated this spirit. Gymnastics as a subject became popular at this time, and schools were required to set up gymnastics classes. However, despite the long history of promoting a martial spirit, in reality our nation still lacks a martial spirit. What is the reason for this? This is because, on the one hand, the traditional disdain of Chinese scholars for soldiers is too deeply rooted, and on the other hand, the military in these decades has really made people look down on them. Now that the country's life is in extreme danger, and the reputation of the military is far better than before, young people who are studying should correct the past mistakes of scholars. Scholars should regard being a soldier as the most honorable thing. The so-called martial spirit does not mean participating in sports and training the body. Doing more sports and training a strong body is certainly very important, but young people today should prepare to be soldiers, prepare to defend the country with their weapons; otherwise, they cannot be good citizens. This is the true meaning of a martial spirit.</p>
<p>Third, young people should have a spirit of enjoying labor. The so-called scholar-officials of China in the past, the scholars of China in the past, not only looked down on being soldiers, but also looked down on working. People with knowledge are unwilling to be soldiers, which is enough to lead to the demise of the country. People with knowledge look down on labor, which can also lead to the demise of the country. We must know that China is a country with backward industry and agriculture. The backwardness of industry and agriculture is no less than the backwardness of military equipment in leading to the demise of the country, or even more than the backwardness of military equipment. Because countries with developed industry and agriculture can easily replenish their military equipment, as long as the people have a martial spirit. If industry and agriculture are not developed, even if the people have a martial spirit, it is not easy to have good military equipment. We can cite a few examples. The United States is a country with extremely developed industry and agriculture that does not have a standing army, but after the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, it trained more than three million excellent troops within a year. The Abyssinians are a very martial and warlike people, but because their industry and agriculture are extremely underdeveloped, Italy dares to bully them. I dare say that if Abyssinia's industry and agriculture had half the level of Italy's industry and agriculture, Italy would not dare to bully them. Our country is also a country with backward industry and agriculture. This is also the main reason why our country is bullied.</p>
<p>Therefore, with only a military and without the backing of industry and agriculture, the freedom and equality of the nation can never be obtained. But to develop industry and agriculture, it is not enough to rely on people without knowledge to work hard as workers and farmers. There must be people with knowledge who are not afraid of working and not afraid of farming in order for industry and agriculture to develop. Modern industry and agriculture are not simple matters. Modern industry and agriculture are technical work. If people with knowledge are afraid of labor and do not move, industry and agriculture will certainly not be easy to progress. We often see students who graduate from engineering and agricultural colleges or vocational schools at home and abroad, because they are afraid of labor, so they only know some theories of industry and agriculture, and cannot be competent to take on practical careers. This phenomenon is extremely pessimistic. Therefore, modern young people must correct this shortcoming of scholars in the past. Modern young people must have a spirit of enjoying labor in order to be good citizens and save China.</p>
<p>Fourth, young people should have a spirit of public service and justice. Callousness is a major flaw in our national character, as mentioned above. Seeing someone injured by a car on the road, and everyone watching without knowing how to help, is a manifestation of callousness. When there are floods or droughts in area A, people in area B, or even wealthy people in area A, indulge in pleasure and do not know how to contribute, which is also a manifestation of callousness. When the country is destroyed, those who are prepared to be slaves to the invaders, and even shamelessly serve the enemy and become ministers of a false country, are also manifestations of callousness. If this kind of inferiority is not eliminated, the nation will not have hope. But how to eliminate this callousness? Only by promoting the spirit of public service and justice. The Boy Scouts' promotion of this spirit is very powerful. I believe that modern young people, whether they join the Boy Scouts or not, should cultivate a spirit of public service and justice, and even more so practice it themselves. When people encounter disasters, they must help. When bystanders are bullied, they must stand up for justice. Be a person with some backbone, don't be too clever, don't just care about one's own interests, and don't talk about loyalty.</p>
<p>We must also know that the spirit of public service and justice is related to the spirit of cooperation and the spirit of martial arts. If one is not eager for public service or justice, the difficulty of cooperation will increase; and the spirit of martial arts will not be easy to cultivate.</p>
<p>Fifth, young people should learn various professions. In the past, Chinese scholars, in the negative sense, were unwilling to be soldiers or work; in the positive sense, they were too fond of being officials. Whether it is the poison of the imperial examination system or not, in today's world, it is necessary to correct this. Being an official is not a bad thing in itself, and administration can also be said to be a profession. But not wanting to have a specialized profession, and only wanting to muddle through in the officialdom, is a very bad thing. If everyone wants to be an official, then first, there must be too many officials, and people are doing more than they should, and politics will not be done well. Second, excellent people will go to the officialdom, and other professions will be affected. The first phenomenon is the modern phenomenon of China, and there is no need to explain it further. The second phenomenon can be explained by the situation in the United States. Americans like to make money as much as Chinese like to be officials. If the Chinese are obsessed with being officials, the Americans can be said to be obsessed with money. In the United States, doing business and being a lawyer are very lucrative, while being an official is very unprofitable, even less than being a university professor. Therefore, there are no outstanding talents in the American political world. China is the opposite. There are indeed many talented people in the Chinese political world. However, there cannot be too many people in the political world, because there are too many people in the Chinese political world, and other sectors feel a lack of talent, and politics is chaotic because there are too many people. If young people can, from today onwards, according to their interests, learn a profession, then in various professions, the law of supply and demand can be implemented, and there will be no lack of talent, and there will be no problem of too many people in the political world.</p>
<p>Sixth, young people should prepare to participate in politics. Learning a profession does not mean that you do not need to care about politics. Politics is something that everyone should care about. The meaning of learning a profession is only to restrict those who want to be officials. Caring about politics is different from being an official. There cannot be one more person who wants to be an official, but there cannot be one person who does not care about politics. The problem in China in the past was that scholars wanted to be officials, and illiterate people did not care about politics. As a result, there were too many officials, but too few people cared about politics. To eliminate this abuse, on the one hand, we must hope that everyone has a specialized profession, so that there will not be too many officials. On the other hand, no matter what profession you are in, you must be interested in politics and you must care about politics. The ancients said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." This means that everyone has a responsibility for the affairs of the country. This also means that everyone must care about the country's politics.</p>
<p>Then how can you be qualified to care about politics? First, you must pay attention to national affairs, including domestic affairs and international affairs; second, you must receive training in the four political powers.</p>
<p>You must pay attention to national affairs. Today's youth, on the one hand, still have too many people who want to be officials, and on the other hand, not enough people pay attention to national affairs. Judging from the matter of students reading newspapers, I can paraphrase a saying of Confucius: "I have not seen anyone who likes to read political news as much as they like to read sports news or social news." This is not a good phenomenon. To care about politics, you must be familiar with the situation of politics. The general understanding of Chinese middle school students of their own country's politics is far less than the general understanding of British and American middle school students of British and American politics. This is why the ability and interest of our Chinese people to care about politics is far behind the ability and interest of British and American people to care about politics.</p>
<p>However, knowing only the political situation and not knowing how to use the four powers is also useless. The so-called four powers are initiation, referendum, election, and recall. Initiation is the power of the people to propose legislation and request the legislative body to pass it. Referendum is the power of the people to vote for or against legislation that has been passed by the legislative body. Election is the power to elect public officials. Recall is the extreme of the people voting on whether to remove public officials from their posts: According to the Premier's Five-Power Constitution, these four political powers are exercised by the people, or exercised by the National Assembly on behalf of the people by voting. No matter how you explain it, to have the ability to care about politics, you must first have the ability to use these four political powers. Therefore, the training to use these four powers is something that young people must not neglect.</p>
<p>The six points listed above are all indispensable conditions for good Chinese citizens. If young people can take the lead and strive to possess the above six conditions, then in ten or twenty years, the knowledge and ability of the Chinese people will be greatly improved, and the work of saving the country will not be difficult to lead. Of course, in addition to these six points, there are other points that young citizens should pay attention to, but the above six are the most important.</p>
<p>Today's ambitious and outstanding young people, many of them hold pessimistic attitudes towards the country. I also acknowledge the dangers of the country and the chaos of society, but pessimism is not a solution. I advise you young people to work hard to understand our country, and work hard to be good citizens. The more you work hard, the less time you have to be pessimistic. The more good citizens there are, the more hope the country has. Young people, you must fulfill your responsibilities to be worthy of the country.</p>

<h3>After the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee Closed, Li, Huang, and Others Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central Committee members Li Shizeng, Huang Jilu, Li Renren, Deng Qingyang, Zhan Jusi, and Cui Guangxi, et al., went to Beijing a few days ago to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Now that the plenary session has ended, they took the night train together from Beijing to Shanghai on the evening of the 11th. They arrived at the North Station at 7:15 yesterday morning and got off the train. Li immediately returned to his private residence on Fucaissen Road. Huang, Li, Deng, Zhan, Cui, et al. went to their respective hotels to rest and decided to stay in Shanghai for a while before going to Beijing again to attend the Fifth National Congress.</p>
<h3>Fujian Chairman Chen Yi Flew to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Go to Beijing Today</p>
<p>Chen Yi, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, accompanied by Li Jiaju, Chief of Staff of the Fujian Provincial Pacification Office, flew from Fuzhou to Shanghai on a China Aviation Corporation Luoling aircraft at 11:25 yesterday morning. He arrived in Shanghai at about 3:00 in the afternoon. After getting off the plane, Chen returned to the Qi residence in Zhangjia Garden on Jing'an Temple Road to rest. Then, at about 4:00, he met with a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency to talk about the recent situation in Fujian Province. Chen is scheduled to take the night express train to Beijing tonight. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel: When Chen arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, those who went to welcome him in the local area included Li Zeyi, advisor to Fujian Province, Wang Changchun, commissioner of the municipal government, Wang Dasui, inspector general of the municipal public security bureau, Gan Hailan, adjutant of the garrison headquarters, Japanese Lieutenant General Banshi, and many relatives and friends. After Chen got off the plane and exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel, he immediately changed to a car and went directly to the Qi residence to rest.</p>
<p>Fujian Province's Finances: A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Chen at his Qi residence. According to the conversation, the province's finances are quite difficult, with a monthly shortage of about 10 million yuan. However, education, military affairs, etc., are not reduced due to the economic impact, and progress is still being made step by step. As for the legal tender issued by the Ministry of Finance this time, the market in Fujian Province has not been affected much, and prices have not increased. This is because there are fewer speculators spreading rumors in Fujian Province, which is not comparable to Shanghai. The Fuzhou Bank has branches of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Southeast World Bank, etc., which will of course handle matters in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Finance without any problems.</p>
<p>Mission to Taiwan: The situation in Fujian Province is extremely peaceful. The remnant bandits in the Fujian-Zhejiang border area will soon be eliminated. Because there were disturbances in Taiwan from time to time, I went to Taiwan at the end of last month to visit the expo, and conveniently had some contact with the authorities in Taiwan. Therefore, the public security in Fujian Province will become more stable in the future.</p>
<p>Going to Beijing Tonight: It is also learned that Chen is scheduled to take the night express train to Beijing at 11:00 tonight to attend the Fifth National Congress, visit the authorities, report on the political situation in Fujian Province, and is expected to stay in Beijing for two weeks before returning to Fujian to take charge of affairs.</p>
<h3>Minister Kong Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Stay for Three or Four Days Before Going to Beijing to Preside Over the Affairs of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Acting Premier of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, took the night train from Beijing on the evening of the 6th and arrived at Zhenru at 7:05 on the morning of the 7th. He immediately returned to his private residence on West Aixiansi Road to rest. Then, at noon, he went to the Central Bank to handle important official business. Kong is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for three or four days before going to Beijing to preside over the affairs of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Xue Dubi Returned to Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Talked about Feng Yuxiang Going to Guangdong, Said He Had Not Heard of It; Li Zongren Definitely Intends to Come North</p>
<p>Central Committee member Xue Dubi went to Beijing a few days ago to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Now that the plenary session has ended, he took the night train from Beijing to Shanghai on the evening of the 11th and arrived at the North Station at 7:15 yesterday morning. He immediately returned to his residence on Masnan Road to rest. Then, he met with reporters from various newspapers and made the following remarks.</p>
<p>Good Impression: According to Xue, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee was held in Beijing this time, and the impression was exceptionally good. Since 1928, the number of attendees at the plenary session has been the largest this year, because there is no way to save the country without national unity. Although there were few proposals at this plenary session, all the Central Committee members were able to concentrate and study them in detail, and they will be implemented one by one in the future.</p>
<p>Feng Staying in Beijing: Mr. Feng Huanzhang has now decided to stay in Beijing for a long time. Mrs. Feng has also arrived in Beijing from Shandong. If there is an opportunity in the future, Feng plans to visit various places to inspect the construction situation in various provinces. As for the rumor of going to Guangdong, it has not been heard in Beijing, and I am afraid it is not accurate.</p>
<p>Li Will Come North: Mr. Dai Jitao and Mr. Ma Chaojun went south this time to exchange opinions, and the results were quite satisfactory. The Southwest will send several people to Beijing to attend the Fifth National Congress. The plan for the National Assembly is that the candidates from the North have not been heard of yet. Mr. Li Zongren definitely intends to come north, but the date of departure has not been decided.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Standing Committee Members Including Song Ziwen and Xu Dong Meet with Finance Minister Kong to Report</p>
<p>Following the Ministry of Finance's announcement of the new monetary policy and its implementation nationwide, the financial situation in various regions has gradually stabilized. The Issuance Reserve Management Committee, responsible for overseeing the issuance, continued its Standing Committee meeting yesterday morning, after which they met with Finance Minister Kong to report on the various regulations for managing the reserve fund. It is expected that these regulations will be announced and implemented within a few days. A summary of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Reserve Committee Holds Standing Committee Meeting. The Issuance Reserve Management Committee, which supervises the issuance by the three banks, held a Standing Committee meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday in the Board of Directors' office on the third floor of the Central Bank. Standing Committee members Song Ziwen, Chen Guangfu, Hu Bijiang, Qian Xinzhi, and Li Jue were present. Drafting committee members Xu Kan, Zhang Gongquan, and others were also in attendance. Mr. Xu presented the draft regulations prepared by the drafting committee, which were discussed in detail. The plan is to convene a full committee meeting to pass the regulations and submit them to the ministry for implementation. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Xu Kan and Chen Xing Meet with Finance Minister Kong. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi left Beijing the night before and arrived in Shanghai around 7:00 AM on the 7th. After returning to his residence to rest, he went to the Central Bank around 11:00 AM to handle official business. Xu Kan and Chen Xing immediately met with Mr. Kong to report on the progress of drafting the various regulations and to seek his instructions. It is said that the draft operational regulations include several items, such as measures for the custody of the reserve fund, methods for the exchange of legal tender, and regulations for the inspection of the reserve fund.</p>
<p>Investigation of Bank Reserves Continues Yesterday. The Issuance Reserve Committee has been dispatching personnel to various issuing banks since the day before yesterday to investigate the amount of issuance and reserves (excluding the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications). Ye Zhuotang and others have completed their investigation of banks such as Zhejiang Industrial Bank. Yesterday morning, they continued their investigation at banks such as China Industrial Bank, completing it in the evening. It is reported that once the investigation of the reserve amount of each bank is completed, the Reserve Committee will notify each bank to transfer the reserve fund to the central, Chinese and Communications Reserve Depository for safekeeping. Although the banknotes already issued by the banks are still allowed to circulate, they are not allowed to continue issuing after the new system is implemented. The exchange of old banknotes will be handled by the Reserve Committee.</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Market is Very Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee announced the equalization tax rate as 57.25%. The Central Bank announced the foreign exchange rates as follows: London one shilling and two and a half pence (equivalent to one yuan in national currency), New York 29.75 yuan, Berlin 73.5 marks, Paris 450 francs, Japan 103 yuan, Hong Kong 80 yuan (all above rates are per 100 yuan in national currency). Customs gold is equivalent to 2.276 yuan in national currency, 33 pence in British gold, and 67.75 cents in American gold per yuan. The rates were the same as in previous days and differed very little from the rates quoted by HSBC. After the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications made every effort to sell foreign exchange to regulate the market, the exchange market has become very stable.</p>
<p>Special Margin for Gold Market Cancelled. The Shanghai Gold Exchange, due to the sharp rise in gold prices a week ago, had announced the collection of a special margin of 50 yuan per tael. Now that the new system has been implemented, financial stability has been achieved, and the upward trend has disappeared. Prices are now below 1,150 yuan. Therefore, an announcement was issued yesterday canceling the special margin. As market prices are gradually stabilizing, the special margin will be canceled from today. Only the original margin of 50 yuan in legal tender per tael will be required. This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<p>Full Cash Exchange for Legal Tender. After the Ministry of Finance announced that silver could no longer be used, it immediately sent personnel to various banks and the joint reserve of money shops to investigate the silver reserves and ordered them to be exchanged for legal tender. The Central Bank also sent letters to various foreign banks instructing them to submit their silver deposits for exchange for legal tender. The regulation for exchanging legal tender stipulates that one yuan of silver is exchanged for one yuan of legal tender, or silver is converted at a rate of 71.5%. It must be at full value. For example, the money shops previously sent more than one million yuan of silver from their reserves to the three banks for exchange for legal tender, all at full value. Reuters Shanghai, 7th: The Governor of the Central Bank today denied the rumor that 60% of silver and 40% of other securities could be exchanged for banknotes of government banks, saying that the three banks controlled by the government are now issuing banknotes at a rate of one yuan of paper money for one yuan of silver. He also said that all silver dollars held by various institutions and banks, including the three government banks, are now being taken over by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee without any deductions.</p>
<p>Premium on Hong Kong Dollars in Guangdong Expected to Increase Significantly. National News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: A well-known foreign exchange banker in the city told a reporter from the National News Agency that the premium on Hong Kong dollars in Guangdong is expected to increase significantly. However, this is not surprising. Firstly, because the Guangdong Provincial Government has only now begun to implement a ban on the export of silver. Secondly, the Guangzhou dollar is often 25 cents less than the central silver dollar.</p>
<p>Shanghai General Labor Union Sends Telegram in Support. The Shanghai General Labor Union, believing that the Ministry of Finance's resolute reform of the currency system this time will benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday to express its support. The text of the telegram is as follows (titles omitted): Since the global economic crisis in recent years, countries have successively revised their monetary policies, leading to a surge in silver prices. As a silver-using country, we have been the first to bear the brunt of the impact. The huge trade deficit and the outflow of large amounts of silver have caused domestic currency to contract, and the national economy has been declining day by day. The entire financial foundation has been on the verge of collapse, and the industrial and commercial sectors have been withering, unemployment has been increasing, and people have been anxious, feeling that the situation cannot continue. The Ministry deeply knows that if it does not seek urgent solutions, the silver will inevitably flow out completely, and the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, it has acted bravely and decisively and resolutely announced the reform of the currency system and the implementation of currency management. The news has spread, and the people are rejoicing, and it is expected that financial stability and smooth currency circulation will be achieved in the future, and the prosperity of the market and the revival of industry and commerce can be expected. The Union respectfully represents all the workers in Shanghai in expressing unanimous support. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Labor Union.</p>
<p>He Bingxian Hopes for National Support. Central News Agency: This time, the new monetary policy implemented by our government has a great impact on our country's foreign trade. The reporter specially visited Mr. He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, to seek his opinion. He provided detailed answers as follows: The new monetary policy promulgated by the government this time is closely related to our country's foreign trade. The major aspects are as follows: (1) As a result of our country's implementation of the new monetary system, exchange rates can tend to stabilize, and at the same time, the domestic price level is expected to be balanced with foreign price levels. Those engaged in foreign trade no longer need to bear the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, import and export trade can be expected to be stable and developed, sweeping away the impact of exchange rate speculation in the past. (2) After stabilizing the foreign exchange rate of the national currency, our country's exchange rate will be lowered, and the prices of our country's goods in foreign markets will be cheaper. Therefore, export trade is expected to increase. Conversely, in terms of imports, the prices of imported goods may be higher. (3) The stability of the currency can attract foreign capital inflows to seek the revival of the domestic economy. At the same time, our country does not need to immediately repay the import goods from various countries, but can keep them in our country to earn interest or engage in investment. In this way, our country's trade deficit can be compensated, and capital outflow can be gradually avoided. (4) As a result of the implementation of the new monetary policy, prices will tend to rise, so agriculture, industry, and commerce can gradually prosper. On the one hand, people's purchasing power will increase, and on the other hand, export capacity will increase. If a comprehensive calculation can be made, it will not be difficult to achieve a mutually adaptable increase in import and export trade, and our country's position in international commerce can also be improved. (5) Since foreign exchange is purchased and sold by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications without any restrictions, it will naturally generate an adjustment function for our country's import and export trade. In this way, our country's foreign trade will be brought back on track in the future. In short, the monetary policy promulgated by the government this time is the best policy for revitalizing our country's foreign trade. We only hope that the people of the country will support it unanimously so that we can achieve prosperity together.</p>
<p>Various Industries Separately Stabilize Commodity Prices. Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the implementation of legal tender, the chips have been able to move and revival is expected. Industrial and commercial circles are all pleased. The Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association specially convened a meeting of all members yesterday to discuss various issues to cope with the environment. Representatives from 37 employee factories attended, chaired by Hu Xituan and recorded by Lin Chao. There were detailed discussions on issues such as raw material financing and commodity prices, and in particular, a more detailed study was made on stabilizing commodity prices. It is reported that other industries will also hold meetings separately to discuss issues such as stabilizing commodity prices.</p>
<p>Sir Ross Gives a Talk. The China Press reports that rumors circulating abroad that the currency system recently announced by the Chinese government was the result of an agreement with the United Kingdom to borrow money have been firmly denied by Sir Ross, the Chief Economic Advisor to the British government. He has also allowed overseas newspapers to publish his statement. The Japanese envoy, Arimasa, based on this denial, gave a talk on the 2nd of October. Sir Ross acknowledged that he had discussed the possibility of borrowing money with the Japanese and American ambassadors. However, Sir Ross told the China Press yesterday (6th) that the Chinese government was forced by market conditions to resolutely implement the new currency system without waiting for the guarantee of loans from various countries. However, for a country in China's position, borrowing money would be very beneficial, and he hoped that in the future, it would be possible to negotiate a solution through the cooperation of other countries, including Japan. Sir Ross then reiterated the Chinese government's monetary plan, saying that, on the whole, this move was not surprising, as abandoning the silver standard had long been expected by the general public. What is surprising is that it was launched suddenly without external assistance. This move is based on the principle of self-reliance, and he hoped that it would be fully successful. The reserves now held by the three banks are sufficient for the government to cope with the situation comfortably. Gradually, China will be in a better position in import and export trade. For the success of the new plan, the reform of the banking system, especially the establishment of an independent central reserve bank, is essential. He had discussed this with the Chinese government and regarded it as part of any monetary plan. The Chinese government has now begun to implement it, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>American Banking Circles Are Very Willing to Cooperate. American Ambassador Johnson told a representative of the China Press yesterday (6th) that he had no comments to make at present regarding the attitude of the American government towards the currency reform implemented by the Chinese government. Johnson has gone to Beijing yesterday and plans to return to Shanghai at the end of the month. Other American government officials stationed in Shanghai said that only the ambassador can express opinions on this issue if it is necessary to make any comments. According to reports, there are three American banks with branches in Shanghai, namely Citibank, Chase Bank, and American Express Bank. It is reported that all three banks reported everything to their head offices yesterday. Mr. Mackay, Vice President of Citibank, said that Citibank is very willing to cooperate with the Chinese government on the currency reform in China, but Washington must provide appropriate protection.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of the Anniversary of Martyr Xia's Sacrifice</h3>
<p>Solemn Family Sacrifice Held.</p>
<p>Heroic Deeds of the Martyr.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of the martyrdom of General Xia Renqing. Xia Xiaoxia, the son of Martyr Xia, specially came to Shanghai from Beijing the night before and held a family sacrifice. Many relatives and friends came to pay their respects, and the situation was quite solemn. Mr. Xia was an advanced member of the Party and the country. He supported the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, organized the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and worked hard for the revolution. He made great contributions. In 1915, he was martyred at No. 1 Hongyi Lane, Pobo Road, French Concession, Shanghai. The deeds of Martyr Xia are recorded below. Xia Zhiqi, styled Renqing, was from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province. At the age of seventeen, he was selected to enter the Jiangnan Military Academy. After graduation, he served successively as an instructor at the Wusong Fort, a training officer in the Jiangxi Standing Army, an instructor at the Jiangxi Military Academy, an instructor at the Nanjing Military Research Institute, a supervisor at the Anhui Training Office, a superintendent of the Jiangxi Army Primary School, and the head of the Jiangxi Military Academy. In Anhui, he met Xu Xilin, Xiong Chengji, and other comrades. He advocated revolution, contacted comrades, and served in education for a total of fifteen years. He was well-known wherever he went. Active military officers who came from his school include Li Liejun, Xiong Shihui, Cao Haosen, and Zhou Hunyuan. During the Wuchang Uprising, Jiujiang responded. At that time, the martyr was serving as the superintendent of the Jiangxi Army Primary School. He summoned the students to encourage them with great righteousness. He personally supervised and led the students, united with the standard battalion artillery team, and attacked and captured the Fuzhou government. He was recommended by the public as the temporary governor, but he declined and recommended Wu Jiezhang to take the post. He himself took charge of military affairs. In March of the Republic of China, Li Liejun was appointed governor of Jiangxi. He sent telegrams to urge and invite him. Due to the friendship between teacher and student, he strongly declined but could not refuse. He returned to take charge of the Military Academy and also served as a senior advisor. In March of the second year of the Republic of China, the Yuan government borrowed 25 million pounds of foreign debt in the name of good settlement. Coincidentally, the Song case broke out suddenly. The martyr knew that Yuan Shikai would revive the ashes of autocracy and betray the trust of the people. Li Liejun came to Shanghai to contact five provinces and planned a second revolution. He appointed the martyr as the chief of staff and rushed back to Hukou to declare war on Yuan Shikai. At that time, the northern soldiers were stationed everywhere, and Li Chun and Duan Zhigui also went south. However, the two provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian were still watching and not moving forward, resulting in failure. The martyr's calculations returned to nothing. Later, Yuan Shikai dissolved the National Assembly, established the Senate, and abolished provincial autonomy. The martyr went to Japan to support Mr. Sun Yat-sen and organized the Chinese Revolutionary Party, urgently planning a third revolution. The public believed that Yuan's power was strong and wanted to wait, but he insisted that it was not possible. He returned to Shanghai to contact comrades. In April of the third year of the Republic of China, the martyr went to Japan again and, under the orders of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, returned from Japan with Chen Qimei, Zhu Zhixin, Ju Zheng, Xu Chongzhi, Shi Qingyang, Fan Mingxian, and other comrades. He was assigned military affairs in Zhejiang, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, and Sichuan provinces. The martyr was ordered to be the Director of Military Affairs, focusing on Zhejiang. The Zhejiang officials detected it and sent Wang Donglu and others to Shanghai to persuade him. The martyr calmly declined and said, "You gentlemen are planning for me very well, but shouldn't I plan for my 400 million compatriots?" Wang and others were speechless and left. As a result, the Zhejiang officials became more vigilant, and the martyr's determination became stronger. He set up agencies everywhere in Hangzhou and decided to launch an uprising on November 24th of that year. One day before, the matter was leaked, and more than 30 comrades died or were imprisoned. At that time, the Qingdao war was urgent, and he was even more indignant. He vowed to raise a different army and go to Japan again to discuss the progress. In the spring of the fourth year of the Republic of China, under the orders of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, he was appointed Director of Military Affairs in Jiangxi. Xia Ciyan was appointed to take charge of Zhejiang affairs. Before long, Xia Ciyan went to Japan, and he took charge of Zhejiang affairs himself. As a result, new and old comrades gathered and competed to be under his command, and his influence grew day by day. The agencies in the two provinces were destroyed and rebuilt, and those who died for the country followed one another without complaint. The martyr always treated people with frankness and without suspicion, so the soldiers were happy to be used by him. At that time, the spies from Jiangxi and Zhejiang came to Shanghai, and Yuan Shikai offered 100,000 gold to buy the martyr. Xiang Lan, who was greedy for money, took the opportunity to assassinate him. He was seriously injured and died. The martyr was only thirty-eight years old at the time.</p>

<h3>Boy Scouts Start Disaster Relief Fundraiser Tomorrow</h3>

It is hoped that all sectors of society will think of the disaster victims and donate generously to benefit the disaster victims. In addition, the association's universal donation campaign has been underway for several days. It is reported that the results of the donations are quite good. Because the various places acting as fundraising agents are enthusiastic, donors feel that it is convenient because of the universal relationship, so they are happy to recognize the donation. In addition, the association received 40 yuan from Wang Zhengxu, 3,053.20 yuan from the Southeast Daily, and a total of 510 yuan from Gu Xinyi's fundraising from Cheng Xuzhao Hall.</p>

<h3>Shipping Industry Submits to Sixth Plenary Session: Requesting Expedited Issuance of Shipping Industry Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Private Shipping Industry in Dire Straits: Inaction is Doomed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association submitted a report to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, detailing the decline of the shipping industry and requesting approval for the issuance of public bonds worth ten million yuan. The original report is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Detailing Difficulties, Seeking Assistance</p>
<p>The submission is regarding the private shipping industry, which is in dire straits. The current situation is unsustainable and on the verge of collapse. We respectfully present the various points of difficulty, and beseech your esteemed committee to review and grant swift assistance. We believe that the shipping industry bears a significant mission and has a profound relationship with the nation, unlike other commercial enterprises. It should be valued by the government, with the hope that it will be safeguarded and nurtured. Our nation's private shipping industry is inherently immature, coupled with the fact that the capital of those engaged in this business is often insufficient. In the past, during periods of smooth transportation, they could barely maintain themselves, with little capacity for development. In recent years, due to frequent turbulent times and repeated disasters, they have suffered repeated blows, injuring their vitality. More recently, due to the recession in all industries, transportation has decreased, and the number of ships without cargo loading and ceasing navigation has been increasing daily. Shipping merchants are facing difficult times, business is declining, loans are impossible to obtain, and they are at the end of their rope, unable to survive. If this continues, the private shipping industry will be seen to collapse beyond recovery, and its future is truly lamentable. We now specifically present to your esteemed committee the most difficult points currently facing us.</p>
<p>Restricting Shipping Routes Causes Disputes</p>
<p>(1) There are no restrictive regulations on the routes that ships can travel in advanced shipping nations. They are mostly divided into three types—ocean-going, coastal, and inland river—based on the condition and capacity of the ships themselves. There is no listing of the names of each port. Currently, ships in our country must list the names of each location on their shipping route certificate. If a location is not listed, they are not allowed to travel there. The original intention of this legislation was likely due to the unequal treaties our country was subjected to, which allowed foreign ships to travel freely inland, so the names of locations were listed to slightly restrict them. Unexpectedly, foreign ships are now not subject to this restriction. They only need a letter from their respective consuls to freely set sail, while only our nation's shipping merchants are subject to this constraint. Shipping merchants are already spending a lot of time and money being bound by this restriction. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation, which is in charge of the shipping industry, has issued an order regarding several inland port routes: "Maintain the status quo before the announcement of the shipping industry reorganization plan." All ships, whether they have a shipping route certificate or not, are not allowed to join in operation. Although the purpose is to quell disputes, the supply and demand are not aligned, the disparity between prosperity and hardship is increasing, and disputes are instead being caused by this. This is the first difficulty.</p>
<p>State-Run and Private Compete Against Each Other</p>
<p>(2) Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was taken over by the state, the shipping industry has been divided into state-run and private. The government's establishment of state-owned shipping and the simultaneous encouragement and protection of private shipping are both clearly stipulated in the Provisional Constitution. However, there are no regulations for division of labor and cooperation between state-run and private, and there is already a reality of competition against each other. State-run companies have priority and exclusive access to all due rights, while private companies bear more of the obligations. If this continues, the recovery of shipping rights will be indefinite, and the bankruptcy of private shipping is imminent. This is the second difficulty.</p>
<p>Water-Land Intermodal Transportation Should Not Be Monopolized</p>
<p>(3) Water-land intermodal transportation between railways and ships facilitates the transfer of goods and is related to the connection of transportation. All countries have implemented it long ago. In our country, since the pilot implementation in the 22nd year of the Republic, private companies have repeatedly requested to participate equally, but the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has always intended to monopolize it. After the Ministries of Transportation and Railways reviewed and approved participation, they continued to delay and obstruct it in every way. Therefore, although approval has been granted for more than a year, private companies have not yet benefited from it. This is the third difficulty.</p>
<p>Tonnage Surcharge and Additional Donations: Unable to Continue Bearing the Burden</p>
<p>(4) The Ministry of Transportation re-established the Wusong Merchant Marine School. Because the costs of restoration were high and the national budget was insufficient to include it, officials were sent to negotiate with merchants. For the sake of cultivating talent and regaining national rights, shipping merchants reluctantly agreed to shoulder 30% of the tonnage surcharge and additional donations to facilitate its completion. This was originally a temporary expedient measure. However, from the 18th year of the Republic to the present, it has continued for six years, amounting to more than 100,000 yuan per year. Since foreign merchant ships do not bear this burden, it has already become difficult in comparison. Recently, they are finding it hard to take care of themselves, and are truly unable to continue bearing this burden. The national education budget has a large annual expenditure, and it should not be difficult to include this only national merchant marine school in the budget. Repeated submissions to the Ministry of Transportation have not been approved to cease the levy. This is the fourth difficulty.</p>
<p>Shipping Industry Public Bonds Should Be Issued Quickly</p>
<p>(5) In the 19th year of the Republic, shipping merchants, due to business depression and financial distress, submitted a request to the government to issue 10 million yuan in shipping industry public bonds to provide relief. The plan was to use the ships as collateral for low-interest loans, and after ten years, the funds would be used to develop international shipping routes. However, although approval was granted, the issuance has been indefinite. Recently, affected by the market, the shipping industry has declined even further than before. Therefore, they have repeatedly reiterated their previous request to save themselves from impending demise. The Ministry of Finance has consistently responded that the funds cannot be transferred and it is inconvenient to discuss the issuance at this time. However, as far as shipping merchants know, the surplus tonnage surcharge amounts to hundreds of thousands of yuan per year, which would be more than enough to allocate to the fund. Moreover, it would be particularly appropriate to use the money paid by shipping merchants to provide relief to the shipping industry. According to the governments of various countries, they all vigorously maintain the private shipping industry. Even in neighboring Japan, there is a protection policy of reducing ship taxes for ships operating on regular schedules. For the creation of new ships, there is a subsidy of one-quarter of the cost, and the remaining three-quarters can be borrowed at low interest rates. And recently, it has been stipulated that for old ships replaced with new ships, each ton of the old ship can be used to subsidize the construction cost of one ton of the new ship, excluding subsidies for insurance and interest. If we extend this to Europe and America, the United Kingdom has subsidies to maintain irregular ships, amounting to 2 million pounds per year, and new ship subsidies amounting to 10 million pounds per year, as well as relief in the form of exempting ship inspection fees and other procedures. Germany has 20 million marks per year specifically for maintaining the shipping industry. France has 500 million francs in long-term low-interest loans. Italy has 300 million lira in annual subsidies. The United States allocates 200 million US dollars per year to private shipping merchants, specifically for their use, with an annual interest rate of only 3%. Shipping merchants are even requesting an annual interest rate of only 0.5%. And recently, President Roosevelt requested Congress to allocate 30 million US dollars annually to subsidize the shipping industry. Other countries such as Norway, Finland, Portugal, and Spain all have rewards or subsidies, valuing and favoring them in every possible way. No wonder they are flourishing and developing day by day. Although our country's Provisional Constitution has articles on rewarding and protecting the private shipping industry, there are no actual benefits. In addition, the financial community does not accept ship mortgages. Moreover, at this critical time of survival, the government has consistently refused to issue the shipping industry public bonds that have been approved. This lifeline that shipping merchants have been relying on the government to provide for urgent relief has been declared hopeless. This is the fifth difficulty.</p>
<p>Private Shipping on the Verge of Extinction: Hoping for Your Accomplishment</p>
<p>The circumstances of shipping merchants have the above-mentioned difficulties, coupled with the fact that current business is increasingly declining. The current situation is difficult to sustain, and is truly in dire straits. If we continue to sit idly by without taking action, the private shipping industry will inevitably collapse beyond recovery. Our association, as a shipping merchant organization, has accurate information and feels it is difficult to remain silent. However, repeated requests to the government have been unsuccessful. Pacing back and forth, we are unable to devise a plan. Now, due to overwhelming worry, we have no choice but to appeal to your esteemed committee, earnestly begging for assistance so that the dying private shipping industry can have a chance of revival. We hope for your accomplishment, which will not only be appreciated by shipping merchants. Therefore, we respectfully submit this document, hoping that you will review it, approve its implementation, and await your orders with utmost trepidation. Respectfully submitted to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Yu Hede, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary Figures' Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng took the night train out of Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai at 7:15 this morning. Chen Diaoyuan and Yuan Liang took the night train to Beijing yesterday. Wu Zhihui and Miao Bin took the express train out of Beijing yesterday morning and arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Additional Points Following the Report of the Telephone Expert Committee</h3>
<p>Discussing the Extent of Increase in Business and Residential Telephone Charges If the Metered Billing Method is to be Continued</p>
<p>The addendum to the report on the telephone problem by the Special Committee of Telephone Experts of the Public Works Department has now been submitted. Yesterday, it was discussed by the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department. When the experts submitted the addendum to the board, they stated that during the meeting of the Public Utilities Committee on the 28th of last month, they had been asked to respond to the matters inquired about in Section 3 of the terms of reference for investigating telephone matters. This has now been done. As for the reason why it was not answered in the general report before, it has been explained on the first page of the general report. The original text of the addendum is translated and recorded below. Section 3 of the terms of reference states: If the metered billing method is maintained, then (1) business telephones, (2) residential telephones, and (3) other items should each increase by how much. The method by which the metered billing rate schedule is gradually obtained is the same as that detailed on page 15 of the general report (Public Bulletin 622 and 623). According to the above-mentioned record, the net profit of the company's operating capital may fall to 8.62% by the end of this year. Furthermore, by the end of this year, the total number of telephones may decrease by 400. Therefore, the company's revenue and expenditure on these telephone rental fees next year will inevitably be lower than this year. In addition, since the expenditure on investment has increased this year, the depreciation that should be accrued from January 1 next year will also slightly increase (Public Bulletin 614, paragraph 2). Now, in order to determine the price of the metered billing method that can offset the monthly fees of 11 yuan and 7 yuan stated in the report, business telephones must pay 15.5 yuan per month, and residential telephones must pay 9.25 yuan per month. And users who currently pay per call should henceforth be charged 11 yuan per month for 150 calls. The surcharge for desk phones should increase to 1.5 yuan, and the fee for extensions should increase to 2 yuan. In the general report, we have discussed in detail the reasons why the metered billing method is not suitable for Shanghai. We firmly believe that if this method continues to be implemented, the number of telephones will inevitably decrease day by day. And as far as we know, many smaller users are anticipating that the per-call billing method will be implemented in the future, and have not yet canceled their telephones. However, if the per-call billing method ceases to be implemented, they will probably also stop using their telephones. Our previous advocacy for the per-call billing method was not only to retain existing users, but also to attract new users in the future, because small users feel that the new prices are lower than the old ones. Therefore, when responding to the request to draft a metered billing price schedule, all we can say is that we not only do not advocate the use of the metered billing method, but on the contrary, we must resolutely criticize its flaws.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Government Bonds Collateral Loan Successful</h3>
<p>Totaling Six Million Yuan, Various Banks Undertake to Borrow Separately: Section Chief Zhou Carries the Loan Agreement Back to Beijing for Approval and Signature</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation's telecommunications government bonds, worth 10 million yuan, have been in contact with Shanghai banking circles to mortgage a loan of 6 million yuan. Since the positive and negative directors of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Shen Shuyu and Zhou Shouliang, and the Ministry of Transportation's representative, Zhou Wenduan, section chief of the Telecommunications Department, have been actively proceeding, a successful agreement has already been reached. The total amount is 6 million yuan, which is undertaken by banks such as the Central Bank. The interest rate is 8%, and it is planned to be paid off in one year. International telephone fee revenue is used as the guarantee. The loan agreement has already been agreed upon. Zhou Wenduan, section chief of the Ministry of Transportation, took the night express train to Beijing last night to request instructions from the Ministry of Transportation and report on the progress. After the Minister of Transportation, Zhu Jia-hua, first signs and affixes his seal, he will then take it to Shanghai and send it to each bank for signature, and then the loan can be disbursed. The amount undertaken by each bank is roughly allocated as follows: the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications jointly acknowledge 3.1 million yuan; the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, 1.2 million yuan; Shanghai, 300,000 yuan; the Continental Bank, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Zhongnan Bank, and the Yanyeh Bank jointly acknowledge 800,000 yuan; Zhejiang Industrial Bank and Kenye Bank each acknowledge 150,000 yuan; Guohuo Bank and Siming Bank each acknowledge 100,000 yuan; Shiye Bank and Guohua Bank each acknowledge 50,000 yuan; totaling 6 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Submit to the Fifth Plenary Session: Clearly Order a Reduction in Rent</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Rent Reduction Association Decide to Go to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that over forty trade associations in this city, including the salted fish industry, have submitted a joint petition to the Fifth Plenary Session, requesting that the relevant authorities be instructed to clearly define rent reduction standards. At the same time, the Municipal Rent Reduction Committee has decided to send representatives to Beijing to petition. Yesterday, a meeting of the petition delegation was convened to discuss petition procedures. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Submissions from Various Industries: Over forty trade associations, including the salted fish industry and the sauce and wine industry, jointly submitted a document to the Fifth Plenary Session yesterday, stating: "The submission is for requesting a prompt and clear definition of rent reduction in order to alleviate the people's difficulties and eliminate disputes. We believe that our country's economic decline has reached its extreme point. The rural economy has already fallen into bankruptcy, and the urban commercial sector is also declining daily. Even just looking at the corner of Shanghai, business is sluggish, far from what it once was. There are many unemployed, and it is difficult to provide employment. Purchasing power is weak, and price indices are therefore gradually decreasing. However, only the rent item remains at the level of five or six years ago, with no hope of reducing the burden. Is this not a kind of abnormal phenomenon? Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are the four necessities of life. At this time of chaos, famine, and increasingly severe recession, in order to maintain life, one can indeed reduce clothing and food, and walk instead of taking transportation, to strive for self-help. However, only the rent for housing, because the power is in the hands of the owners, is a particularly heavy burden that cannot be resolved. It is still impossible to adapt to the environment and slightly alleviate the difficulty. Those owners are people who own assets, and their lives are certainly better than those of ordinary tenants. If they could slightly reduce the rent, it would certainly not harm them in the slightest, while the tenants would have benefited greatly. However, in recent years, despite the appeals and requests of tenants, there are very few who have considered the overall situation and granted rent reductions. Therefore, looking around, all that can be seen is a sluggish market, rows of empty houses, and several businesses forced to close every day. Those who have been sued for rent arrears and ruined their families are countless. If we do not urgently seek to save the future of society, we do not know where it will end. Fortunately, the Plenary Session has opened in Beijing, and representatives from the entire party are gathered together. They should have detailed discussions on national and people's livelihoods. Especially Shanghai, as the commercial center of the country, should strive to make it prosperous. In addition to the representatives sent by the Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee to petition, we humbly submit the following details, begging for your review. We earnestly request that you consider the decline of Shanghai's commercial sector and the crisis of the social economy, and promptly and decisively issue a clear order to reduce rent in order to alleviate the difficulties of the entire Shanghai population. We cannot express our eagerness and anticipation enough. Respectfully submitted to the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party."</p>
<p>Decisions of the Rent Reduction Association: The Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee's Beijing petition delegation held a public temporary meeting in the association hall at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss matters related to the Beijing petition. Nine people, including Li Aokui, Wang Hesong, Ge Futian, Chen Jiufeng, Wang Jingdong, and Jin Chuxiang, attended. Li Aokui was publicly elected as chairman. The chairman first reported, and then the matters for discussion were discussed. (1) The proposal to schedule a petition to Beijing was resolved. It was decided that the petition would be held in Beijing on the morning of the 11th of this month, gathering at the North Station to take the express train. (2) The proposal to select a drafter for the Beijing petition submission was resolved. It was decided that Ge Futian would be responsible for drafting, with the following content: (1) Requesting a clear order to reduce rent by 40%. (2) Once the market recovers, the original state will be restored. (3) The funds obtained from the rent reduction in the first two months will be used to help disaster relief. (4) After three months, the tenants will enjoy the benefits. (5) It is stipulated that the interest on real estate leases must not exceed 5%.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Anniversary of the Soviet Russian October Revolution</h3>
<p>Russian Ambassador Celebrates at the Embassy in Beijing</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 18th anniversary of the Soviet Russian October Revolution. The Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Dmitry Bogomolov, held a celebration at the embassy at No. 32 Gaoloumen, Nanjing, and invited people from all walks of life to visit. As for the Soviet Russian Consulate on the Bund Huangpu Road in Shanghai and the commercial firms run by Russians, they all flew flags to celebrate. It is heard that the authorities of the Chinese Concession temporarily imposed martial law.</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspection Group Leaves Shanghai to Return Home</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the fourteen-member Chinese Investigation Group organized by the Japanese Telecommunications News Agency has completed its mission after visiting North China and places such as Beijing and Shanghai. They departed from Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 7th by the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru to return home. Representatives from the Japanese Consulate General in this port and the militia went to the port to see them off. The group left Japan at the end of October and visited Qingdao, Jinan, Tianjin, Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Hankou, Nanjing, Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other ports, and received enthusiastic hospitality from our country along the way and were given convenience in their investigations.</p>
<h3>Consul General to the Netherlands, Song Faxiang, Arrives in Shanghai After Attending the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that Song Faxiang, Chinese Consul General in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, arrived in Shanghai on the Zhini Canadian ship to attend the Fifth National Congress, accompanied by Wu Weida, Supervisor of the General Branch of the Nationalist Party in the Dutch East Indies. He plans to go to Beijing that night to attend the Congress. The reporter visited Mr. Wu and Mr. Song during their trip. According to Consul Song, he has no special proposals to attend the Congress this time. There are ten representatives from the Dutch East Indies in total, who have already reported to Beijing one after another. The lives of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are quite stable, and there has been no anti-Chinese tide recently. The rumors from the outside world are somewhat exaggerated. In recent years, the Dutch East Indies has restricted the import of 58 kinds of foreign goods, which is beneficial to our country, because if genuine Chinese goods are imported into the Dutch East Indies, there will be no obstacles. As for the economic situation of overseas Chinese, although it has improved slightly recently, it has still not been able to get rid of the impact of the recession. This situation is the same in all parts of Nanyang, not only in the Dutch East Indies. What overseas Chinese feel most painful about is the local government's levy of business income tax. According to the regulations of the Dutch government, the business income tax is levied at 45%. At a time when the world economy is in recession, overseas Chinese are really unable to bear this heavy burden.</p>
<h3>Singaporean Overseas Chinese Tycoon Li Zhendian Returns to the Country and Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that Mr. Li Zhendian, a Singaporean overseas Chinese tycoon, has been engaged in various industries in Singapore for more than 30 years, and is extremely famous in Singapore. He also played a very strong role in overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and establishing the revolution. In recent years, Mr. Li has been actively paying attention to the development of industrial plans in the motherland. It is learned that Mr. Li left Singapore on a French mail ship a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday. After a short rest in Shanghai, he plans to go to various parts of the country to inspect the current situation of industrial construction and mineral deposits as a reference for future organization. It is heard that there is also one representative from the local overseas Chinese attending the Fifth Plenary Session who came with him. Huang Jianzhong of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation and Zhang Gongti of the Central Representative Reception Office in Shanghai personally went to the Xinguang Wharf to welcome them.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Hengfeng Road Police Station Cracks Down on Robbery Gang</h3>
<p>Ten Men and Women Apprehended, Large Quantity of Stolen Goods Recovered: One Browning Handgun and Seven Bullets</p>
<p>At around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, the director of the Zhabei Hengfeng Road Police Station, Lu Pei, led police chief Lu Youcun, policemen Wang Yuntang, Chai Enyuan, Chen Fengqi, Chen Mingsheng, and Shao Xueying, and detectives Mao Gongzhao and others, to inspect pedestrians at the intersection of Meiyuan Road and Hanzhong Road, which borders the Xinza Police Substation. They encountered a person wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, who looked flustered. Knowing that something was wrong, Lu and others pretended not to know. When the person approached, they immediately ordered him to stop and raise his hands. A six-inch Browning handgun was found on his body, with seven bullets inside. Knowing that he was a member of a robbery gang, they immediately took him to the station. According to his confession, his name is Gao Youcai, 36 years old, from Jiancheng. With his accomplices Zhu Asi, Xiaojinzi, Gu Longfei, and Shunzi, he carried two handguns and had fired a shot at No. 1 Yuanfang Lane, Changan Road. They also robbed the Jin Chen family at No. [number missing] in the bamboo fence inside Meiyuan Road, which is Lane 108, and obtained two [type of item missing], 93 yuan in paper money. They also robbed the Yue Tian family of one gold ring, worth 8 yuan in paper money, the Ren Hengji family of 4 yuan in paper money, the Xue Zhang family of one watch, 2 yuan in silver, and 25 yuan in paper money and one silver-inlaid gemstone ring. They then distributed the loot at No. 116, Tongshang Hotel, Nicheng Bridge. Director Lu immediately dispatched patrol officer Sui Guoqing and police chiefs Shao Zhenhong and Lu Youcun to investigate and verify that it was true. According to the victims, the four robbers were all wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants, entered through the front door, exited through the front door, and fled east. According to the thief's confession, his accomplices were hiding in the Dongxin Hotel in the French Concession and the Xizang Hotel in the British Concession.

The accomplices had all fled upon hearing the news, and only Chen Chunlin, 34 years old, from Taizhou, was apprehended. All are currently under interrogation.</p>

It is also reported that Mr. Lin will go to Hangzhou to solicit after finishing business here.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request to Abolish the Collection of Pig Tax at the Gaoka Checkpoint in Jiangbei</h3>
<p>Taxing Goods as the Object is Actually Repeating the Mistakes of the Former Likin System</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying, "To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: On the sixth of this month, we received a letter from the Fresh Pig Vending Trade Association, stating that the pig merchants Zhang Yiyuan, Xue Dawu, etc., from Dongtai wrote, 'Since we merchants suffered from the disturbance of the communist bandits, and then added frequent water interest, rural bankruptcy, and those who maintain a line of livelihood rely entirely on the pigs produced in Dongtai, which are transported to Shanghai for sale. We scrape for meager profits to avoid hunger for several family members. After Jiangbei Special Tax sent Chang to collect business tax on transporting pigs, we merchants tried our best to bear the burden and abide by the rules. Unexpectedly, this spring, the Dongtai Business Tax Bureau had a whimsical idea and privately set up checkpoints, intercepting our pig boats along the way and coercing us to collect pig tax again. If one pig pays one tax and passes through the special tax collection office, the ticket should be verified and released. However, the special tax collection office not only does not verify and release, but also needs to count the number and report the payment, which means one pig pays two taxes, and the people's strength is really unimaginable. It is found that the Dongtai Business Tax Bureau privately uses the Tai Dong Business Tax ticket to collect business tax on transporting pigs. The ticket is written in blue ink, and there are words on the ticket specifically for cattle tax. Since it is a cattle tax ticket, how can it be used for pig transport tax? This is a certain and unchangeable principle. It also uses a note to collect pig tax. Inspecting the stamp on the ticket is a long strip shape. This kind of shady scene, layer by layer of malpractices, is known to those who do not need to be enlightened. We merchants are at a time when we are forced by livelihood and it is difficult to bear this one pig and two taxes. We especially present the facts with tears, and ask your association to examine and approve, and to take pity on the merchants' difficulties, and to allow us to transfer the facts to the authorities and strictly order the Dongtai Business Tax Bureau to stop collecting the tax and punish the director of the bureau, Chen Yunzhang, in accordance with the law, in order to rectify the law and discipline and pay attention to the people's livelihood. (Omission) The business tax is a behavior tax, so the same business entity and the same business behavior must not be taxed repeatedly. The tax should be collected at the business location and should not be collected at the passing place. This is the fundamental difference between the business tax and the likin. It is now found that the attached photographic receipt shows that the bureau did not collect taxes on a monthly basis in accordance with the short-term business regulations. It is true that the tax is collected once every time the goods pass. It is obvious that it is a likin checkpoint. Furthermore, the Zhang Yiyuan company paid the tax in Dongtai on August 29th, and the next day, August 30th, the tax was collected again in Rugao, where the ship passed. It is even more obvious that checkpoints are set up along the way to intercept, and the business entity is not the object of taxation, but the goods are the object of taxation. Recently, merchants have complained about the business tax, saying that the tax has not been implemented for a long time, and it has already followed the mistakes of the former likin system. Other places are not mentioned for the time being. Jiangsu Province is close to the capital, and the national government orders should be implemented without hindrance. The illegal handling of the pig business tax has been telegraphed to your ministry by the association, and a case has been filed for strict correction. After several months, the order is still being played with. Where is the national code of conduct? It is appropriate to re-attach the photographic receipt and telegraph it to your ministry for verification. We hope that you will strictly investigate and correct it, and must abolish the checkpoints along the way and dismiss and punish the contractors. How can we express our public gratitude? Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows."</p>

<h3>Gu Zhuxuan Appeals</h3>
<p>The Special Second Court Has Received the Appeal Petition and Will Send it to the Higher Third Branch Court for Review</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage, was accused of instigating murder by Zhao Guangfu, a criminal in the case of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, who was assassinated and died. The police department sent Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Gu and filed a public prosecution with the Special Second Court. After several court hearings by Wang Gangxu, the chief of the criminal court, and Xiong Huiping and Zhang Chaozuo, the two judges, together with prosecutor Wang Ren, the court concluded that Gu Zhuxuan was guilty of instigating murder and sentenced him to 15 years of imprisonment and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights on the 28th of last month. His family members and Gu expressed their dissatisfaction with the initial trial and have appointed a lawyer to file an appeal. The judgment and other documents have been detailed in this newspaper. It is now learned that after receiving Gu's appeal petition, the Special Second Court has had the clerk in charge of the case sort out the case file and send it to the higher Third Branch Court for review within the next day or two. Tang Youmei, the younger sister of the victim Tang Jiapeng, has filed a petition, which is currently being drafted by the acting lawyers Zhou Yongding and Wang Shizong, etc., to file a separate lawsuit. However, the amount of the lawsuit is not yet known in detail and will be recorded after visiting and clarifying.</p>
<h3>Rumors Again Emerge of Elevated Railway Construction in this City</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that last year, it was rumored that the Chinese side intended to connect the Nanshi and the city center by constructing an elevated railway. On the 4th of this month, foreign merchants from Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, and other countries presented a plan to establish the Shanghai Elevated Railway Company with a capital of 200 million yuan and persuaded Japan to join. However, it has not yet been determined whether the plan set by the foreign merchants this time has anything to do with China. It is reported that the plan is an attempt by Britain. If Japan refuses to participate, then France, the United States, Belgium, and other countries will definitely agree. If this huge plan is realized, it will not only exceed the scope of profitable facts, but also contain profound political implications.</p>
<h3>Patrolman Shoots and Kills Thief in Zhifeng Lane, Huanlong Road</h3>
<p>Victim Robbed Once in July</p>
<p>Yao CaiTing, a local resident of No. 6 Zhifeng Lane, No. 88 Huanlong Road in the French Concession, is 57 years old. His son, Shu Min, works as a clerk in the Dafeng Foreign Firm on Avenue Edward VII. At around 7 pm last night, Shu Min returned home from work. As soon as he entered the gate, he suddenly caught sight of white light on the glass window upstairs, which was quite strange. He immediately shouted loudly, "Who is there?" Unexpectedly, there was indeed a thief upstairs. Upon hearing the sound, he fled in a panic over the wall and into the adjacent house at No. 9. Yao, upon seeing this, then shouted for help. At that moment, the Chinese patrolman No. 626 from the French police station was patrolling the area. Upon hearing the alarm, he rushed in with his gun and encountered the thief. The patrolman then fired a shot at him, hitting the thief in the head, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. The patrolman immediately reported to the police station. The police chief sent detectives to investigate and then transported the thief's body to the coroner's office for examination and reporting to the Second Special District Court for inspection. Afterwards, according to the victim Yao CaiTing, his home was robbed once in July of this year, and the losses were quite large.</p>
<h3>Korean Assassinated in Qianjia Lane</h3>
<p>Inner Details Cannot be Ascertained</p>
<p>No. 97 Qianjia Lane, Guangfu Street, Jixi, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, was formerly rented by a Chinese who opened a clothing store, and then transferred it to a Korean named Li Wei (32 years old). The monthly rent was 25 yuan. Li had a close friend named Li Taixi, about 30 years old, also of Korean nationality, who had been living in the kitchen shed for a month. Unexpectedly, at about 2:15 pm yesterday, a thug riding a bicycle broke into Li's house. Upon seeing Taixi, he immediately opened fire, hitting him in the head and killing him instantly. Someone then called the French police station, who immediately sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. Because the deceased was Korean, they immediately notified the Japanese Consulate, which ordered criminal division officers to rush to the scene for inspection. However, the French police station kept the case strictly confidential. According to neighbors, the deceased was probably not a legitimate businessman. The personnel sent by the Japanese embassy and the detectives stationed by the French police station not only kept their mouths shut, but also prohibited anyone from entering the house to investigate, so the detailed circumstances and the reason for the attack could not be ascertained. The deceased's body has been taken to the Tielast Road Coroner's Office for examination.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Inland River Steamer: Interrogation Record of the Bandits</h3>
<p>There was an Inside Line on the Steamer; Collective Discussion to Rob Together</p>
<p>—Three Women Released as Unrelated—</p>
<p>Laozha Police Station Chief Detective You A'gen, Detective Liu Junqing, Detective He Xiaozhi, Yang Guanying, etc., previously arrested nine people at No. 46 Xiangfu Lane, Carter Road, No. 91 and No. 131, Lane 36, Zhangjiazhai, Avenue Evenue Edward VII., etc.: the thieves Li Rongsheng, Xi Genan, Li Arong, Chen Fusheng, Yang A'da, Lin Genxing, and the women Wang Xiubao, Shen Chenshi, Zhu Yangshi, etc., and confiscated two pistols and 230 bullets. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The detectives found that Li and the others had robbed passengers of the inland river steamer Yuanfeng near Youjiagang, Huzhou, at around 9 pm on September 30 of this year, taking valuables worth 500 yuan. Yesterday morning, it was the date for continued interrogation. Judge Feng Shide opened the first criminal court for interrogation. Wang Yaotang, the police station lawyer, stated that in addition to the women Wang Xiubao, Shen Chenshi, and Zhu Yangshi, the police station would not prosecute and requested that they be released first. The remaining defendants were all prosecuted for robbery under Article 330 of the Criminal Law and endangering public safety under Article 187 of the same law. The defendants held a meeting at Li Rongsheng's house, No. 46 Xiangfu Lane, Carter Road, on September 29 to plan the robbery of the Yuanfeng steamer. They then waited in a small boat at Youjiagang, which the Yuanfeng had to pass through, at 9 pm on the 30th. When the Yuanfeng arrived, the defendants all blackened their faces and fired a shot to stop it from moving forward. They jumped onto the steamer one by one and robbed it, obtaining banknotes, clothes, and other items worth about 500 yuan. The police station has arrested them and confiscated a box of ginseng, 95 yuan in banknotes, three woolen hats, a bolt of cloth, and a red quilt, all of which are part of the stolen goods. Each defendant has a confession at the police station and should be tried, etc. Li Rongsheng confessed that someone named Jia Fanglong, who worked on the Yuanfeng steamer, invited Xi Genan, Chen Fusheng, Yang A'da, and Lin Genxing to my house on September 29, and the next day, they went to rob together. At that time, they first set off a firecracker, and did not fire a shot. Only Arong, Genan, and A'da and I, four people, Arong held the gun, and they all took the money and goods, etc. After Judge Feng interrogated the other defendants, they all confessed without denial. The court then ordered a postponement for further interrogation. Wang Xiubao, Shen Chenshi, and Zhu Yangshi, who were not prosecuted by the police station, should be released immediately, and the rest were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Extortionist Zhao Jingting Once Served in the Military</h3>
<p>Wanted to Mortgage a Box Cannon for Cash, But Denied Intimidation and Coercion</p>
<p>Zhao Furong's family in Xiantang, No. 3 Dasheng Lane, No. 54 Avenue Paul Beau in the French Concession was visited by a thug at around 8 am on the 28th of last month. Zhao was worshipping Buddha and chanting scriptures in front of the Xiantang in the parlor when suddenly a bandit rushed in with a gun, threatening Zhao and attempting to extort 500 yuan. Zhao's family then went outside to call for help. The bandit panicked upon hearing the sound and fell down the stairs while running outside. At the intersection of Rue Picard Destelan, Detective Zhou Bingcheng, Detective Le Sixiang, and others passing by, together with a patrolman, stopped the bandit and confiscated a box cannon. They were taken to the police station for investigation, as reported in previous newspapers. The bandit was taken to the police station and identified himself as Zhao Jingting, 25 years old, from Shaoxing, who had previously served as a scribe in the Sixth Army. A military certificate from the Sixth Army Fourth Division Headquarters was found on his body. The next day, he was sent to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention. The police station has concluded its investigation. Yesterday morning, the chief of the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court held a trial in the first criminal court. The police department lawyer prosecuted him for intimidation. Detective Le Sixiang, who was in charge of the case, reported the process of the defendant's carrying a gun and intimidation, and presented the box cannon. The plaintiff, Zhao Furong, also came to court to testify that the defendant came and demanded money with a gun, saying that he wanted 500 yuan at the time, at least 300 yuan, and if he didn't give it, he would use coercive means. The defendant Zhao Jingting confessed that he had served in the military before. This box cannon was obtained when fighting the communists in Guizhou. Now in Shanghai, he was in extreme distress. Because he knew the plaintiff, he went to him to borrow three or five hundred yuan and then rejoin the army. He wanted to mortgage the box cannon to the plaintiff and there was no intimidation or coercion. The witness, Buddha's wife Hu Guiying, 53 years old, a vegetarian who chanted the Buddha's name and lived in the plaintiff's pavilion, confessed that he (referring to the defendant) came that day to borrow 500 yuan from the plaintiff, and I went out to report to the police, and did not push him down, etc. After the court verified the confession, it was decided to reschedule the trial for the 16th, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Passenger on Xinningshao Steamer Commits Suicide En Route to Shanghai</h3>
<p>In the Waters of Qilishiyu Outside Zhenhai Port; the Person Spoke with a Jiangbei Accent and Claimed to be Named Zhang</p>
<p>The Xinningshao steamer of the Ningshao Merchant Shipping Bureau sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai at 5 pm on the 2nd of this month. At about 8 pm that night, when the ship was passing through the Qilishiyu waters outside Zhenhai Port, a middle-aged passenger in the fourth-class cabin of the steamer suddenly jumped into the sea from the deck and committed suicide. Afterwards, the steward found a long robe and a woolen hat in his cabin, but no suicide note. It is reported that the person spoke with a Jiangbei accent and claimed to be named Zhang.</p>
<h3>Sisters Sue Each Other</h3>
<p>Younger Sister First Sues Older Sister of Suspicion of Theft; Older Sister Then Accuses Younger Sister of Defamation</p>
<p>Wang Yulan, also known as Zheng Liumei, a woman from Huangyan, Taizhou, Zhejiang, lived at No. 5 Pingle Lane, Xizang Road. On the 18th of last month, she reported to the Laozha Police Station that the piggy bank hidden in her box had disappeared, containing more than 1,000 silver coins. On the 16th, her older sister Zheng Simei came to her house and asked the maid A'bao to fetch something from her house at about 7 pm when she went out, so she was quite suspicious. Detective Wu Qilan went to Zheng Simei's house at No. 12 Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, for investigation, but Zheng was not there. Zheng then turned herself in to the police station. The detectives did not accept the case because the two parties were sisters and there was no concrete evidence. Recently, Zheng Simei hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution against Wang Yulan in the First Special Court, accusing her of false accusations and defamation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao XieFen opened the second criminal court for interrogation. Zheng Simei stated that in addition to falsely accusing her of theft, the defendant also accused her of specializing in theft, running salted meat shops, and engaging in prostitution to provide her husband with money to smoke opium, which caused her husband to break off their cohabitation relationship, so she filed a lawsuit, etc. Witness Wu Qilan, a Chinese detective, filed a case to prove the investigation situation, and said that he did not hear any quarrels at the police station at that time. The defendant then said that she had been stolen money, which was a fact. The defendant had a major suspicion, which was undeniable. Now, she is suing me, and I am really unwilling. If I have to file a counterclaim, I will accuse the plaintiff of smoking red pills. After Judge Xiao ordered the two parties to debate, he immediately announced the verdict that Wang Yulan was not guilty.</p>
<h3>Chatting While Walking on the Roof; One Foot Stumbled and Fell</h3>
<p>Fan Heng, a native of Jiangbei, lives at No. 4 Tiande Road, Zhabei, and works as a coolie in the Public Works Department Hygiene Department. At about 3 pm yesterday afternoon, Fan was sweeping the roof of the triangular vegetable market in Hongkou, chatting with his companions while sweeping. Unexpectedly, he retreated to the edge of the roof and did not realize it, so one foot stumbled and his whole body fell from the roof. His head and feet were severely injured. Fortunately, the guard caught sight of him and sent him to the hospital for treatment. His situation is very critical.</p>
<h3>Dissected Arm to be Examined</h3>
<p>Two Arms to be Studied by Forensic Doctors; Police Station to Investigate the Source</p>
<p>In the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Cemetery, east of the First Special District Court and near Avenue Alapeyron, a scavenger boy, Cai Shuangtao, discovered two dissected left arms, one after the other, in the bushes the day before yesterday. The skin color was already yellow. Huisi Police Station of the district ordered detective Chen Kezhang and others to go to the scene. After investigation, since there was nothing else to be found, the two arms were sent to the Feilun Road Coroner's Office, etc., as reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, prosecutor Guo Tong from the First Special Court, together with two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., arrived at the office for inspection. They then ordered that the two left arms be temporarily stored in the court for forensic doctors to study, and the police station continued to investigate the source of the two arms.</p>
<h3>Telephone Expert Explains the Attitude When Drafting the Report</h3>
<p>Matters for Discussion Limited to the Scope of Authority; Land Price Estimation Based Solely on Expert Opinion</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily published an interview with Mr. Lin, a professor of bookkeeping at the Tongwen Academy of this port, who criticized the report of the Public Works Department Telephone Expert Committee. Yesterday, the four national experts of the Expert Committee sent an official letter to the newspaper to respond to Mr. Lin's opinions. The main points of the expert's official letter are excerpted as follows: "We were very pleased to read Mr. Lin's great argument the other day. However, since Mr. Lin is dissatisfied with our report, we also have considerable regrets about what Mr. Lin said. There are several words in Mr. Lin's thesis that have greatly alarmed us, which can be briefly stated. It seems to say that "the numbers are not credible and can be arbitrarily increased or decreased to distort any facts," etc. We do not want to be too demanding on Mr. Lin, but it is strange that what Mr. Lin said was actually said by a bookkeeping professor, because the first duty of a bookkeeper is to audit the accuracy of the numbers and represent concrete and unchangeable facts. Furthermore, we especially want to share with people that we have stated one by one the matters within the scope of our authority, but Mr. Lin claimed in the interview that the public's position should not be ignored in the report, etc. In fact, when we were drafting the report, we not only did not ignore this point, but also exceeded the scope of our authority in fact. However, the matters that we were ordered to investigate must first be answered one by one before we can involve other points. Taking the first point that we should answer as an example, the question is "Does the telephone company have the right to increase prices?" After investigating, we found that the company does have the right to increase prices if the profits are insufficient after fulfilling certain conditions. According to the express provisions of the franchise contract, it should have the right to increase prices. As for other issues, such as whether the interest rate is appropriate, whether the public can afford it, etc., are indeed not within the scope of our authority and there is no way to add any opinions. Moreover, the franchise contract clearly stipulates that the interest rate on operating investment should be percentage plus percentage two, and also specifies what is operating capital, so we have no way to criticize the company's fundraising methods. As for items such as income tax and management fees, we did not comment on them because we were ordered not to discuss them. Furthermore, as for the land price, what we relied on was a certificate from the land price estimator at the time, and the valuation had been approved by the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau. Of course, the evaluation of land price cannot be as accurate a science as bookkeeping. At most, it can only accept the opinions of signed experts, which is also what we have already done. We are very grateful to Mr. Lin for explaining the complicated procedures in the report, but we feel that there is no need to add any further in-depth discussion other than this reply."</p>
<h3>Discovery of Three Kidnapping Cases on the Mingsheng Steamer</h3>
<p>Kidnapped Women Severely Abused; Perpetrators Awaiting Court Interrogation</p>
<p>On the morning of the day before yesterday, around 10 a.m., Customs and Water Police, upon orders, dispatched Huang Zhencun, Wang Haiquan, and Xu Jueul, together with Chen Shaoting, an investigator from the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, to inspect the Mingsheng steamer of the Yihe Company's Northern Seas route. They successfully uncovered three kidnapping cases in the steerage section. Liu Xiangsheng and Zhong Wanshi were found to have jointly kidnapped a thirteen-year-old girl from Yangzhou, Liu Xiaolianzi. Hu Wangshi was found to have lured and kidnapped a twelve-year-old girl from Danyang, Lin Xiuying. Su Bao was found to have kidnapped Xu Zhangshi (19 years old), a young married woman from Changzhou. All were intended to be sold in Qingdao. They were immediately taken to the police station for separate interrogations. According to the first case, the defendant Liu Shengxiang confessed: "I am thirty-nine years old, from Anhui. Zhong Wanshi lured Liu Xiaolianzi from the street to her home. Jiang Guifang, who lives with her, planned to sell her to Qingdao. Last night, after Wanshi and I escorted Liu Xiaolianzi onto the ship, I tricked her into an empty room and raped her; this is true." Wanshi's confession was similar to Liu Xiangsheng's. According to the kidnapped Liu Xiaolianzi, "Since I was a child, I was raised as a child bride in the home of a certain family in the Sun Temple of Zhabei. Because I was abused by my parents-in-law, I escaped once last year and was sent to the Qiliang Shelter, where I stayed for over a year before my parents-in-law took me back. Now, my parents-in-law have resumed their old habits, beating me so badly that I urinate blood. Unable to bear the pain, I took another opportunity to escape and met the defendants, who offered to arrange a marriage for me as a child bride in Qingdao. I didn't know I was being deceived. I bled a lot during the rape," and so on. According to the second case, the defendant Hu Wangshi confessed: "I am thirty years old, from Suzhou. The girl I brought, Lin Xiuying, was bought by my husband's friend, Wang Jiesan, in Danyang from her parents for 120 yuan. He sent her to my home ten days ago to stay for a few days. On the morning of the fifth of this month, he told me to send her to a small inn on Avenue Joffre. In the afternoon, three people from Shandong, Wang Jinsheng and Cao Zurong, and Zhang Bingxiao from Changzhou, claimed to have come to Shanghai from Qingdao and planned to take Xiuying to Qingdao for marriage. They told me to send her to Qingdao, falsely claiming that she was born when I was eighteen, and promising to reward me with ten yuan after the matter was completed. That night, at 9 p.m., Wang Jiesan, Wang Jinsheng, and Cao Zurong brought Lin Xiuying to the Mingsheng steamer. Wang Jiesan returned first. When inspectors arrived, Wang and Cao also took the opportunity to escape," and so on. The kidnapped Xiuying also said that her parents had arranged to sell her to someone else. According to the third case, the defendant Cao Subao confessed: "I am thirty-one years old, from Changzhou, and live near the Public University Yarn Factory in Yangshupu. I know the female worker Xu Zhangshi. I conspired with my friend Jin Liugen to kidnap Zhangshi and sell her to Qingdao. We were caught on the ship," and so on. According to the kidnapped Xu Zhangshi, also known as Sanmei: "I work at the Public University No. 1 Yarn Factory. I met a female coworker named Xiaomei a month ago. Half a month ago, Xiaomei introduced me to her husband, Cao Subao. Xiaomei said that the wages in Shanghai were low and the wages in the Qingdao factory were high, and that she would like to go to Qingdao with me to work. On the afternoon of the 31st of last month, at 6 p.m., I received four yuan in wages. When I left the factory, I saw Cao Subao and his friend Jin Liugen already waiting. They said that the ship to Qingdao had already arrived in Shanghai. Jin accompanied me by car to a small inn to stay. That night, Jin raped me once. The next day, Cao also came to the inn. Jin then excused himself and left. Cao raped me again. By the 5th of this month, Cao had raped me three times, and Jin raped me every night. Unable to bear the pain, on the morning of the 6th, Cao accompanied me onto the ship. Jin said he would come in four days, but suddenly we were arrested," and so on. After the detectives obtained their confessions separately, they ordered the kidnapped women to be temporarily sent to the Relief Association for care, and the defendants were all detained. They also ordered the original detectives to strictly arrest the accomplices. Yesterday afternoon, they ordered detectives from the Putuo Road Police Station to arrest Jin Liugen, an accomplice of Cao Subao, and bring him back for joint trial. The three kidnapping cases will be transferred to the District Court for trial today.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu and Others Initiate the Establishment of the New Yongding Construction Association</h3>
<p>Hu Wenhu Elected President, Lin Luming General Manager; General Association Established in Shanghai, Branch Associations Established in Nanyang and Other Places</p>
<p>Shanghai News reports that Hu Wenhu, Lin Luming, Hu Guigeng, Su Lezhen, and others, in view of the fact that their hometown of Yongding County in Fujian Province has suffered from banditry for years, houses have been burned, fields have been deserted, and the economy has been depleted, initiated the organization of the New Yongding Construction Association to strive for a hometown rescue movement. The inaugural meeting was held yesterday morning at 9 a.m. on the ninth floor of the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge. More than eighty people attended. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department, Mao Yun, and the Social Affairs Bureau, Rao Qiangsheng, attended to provide guidance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Lin Luming, master of ceremonies Li Guangteng, performed the formalities. First, the chairman reported on the preparations, stating that today's inaugural meeting of the New Yongding Construction Association would briefly report on the motivation for the establishment of the association and future plans. Yongding was a good paradise twenty years ago. In the past twenty years, banditry has been continuous, and people have been unable to make a living, causing many fellow villagers to be homeless or unable to return home. Whenever they gather and talk about it, they feel extremely painful. Therefore, we initiated the organization of the New Yongding Construction Association to restore past prosperity. We rely on the efforts of the people themselves and the assistance of the government to build a new Yongding, which will surely be twice as effective with half the effort. We hope that everyone will unite together and use a spirit of sacrifice to carry out the hometown rescue movement, without fear of difficulties, without complacency, and without selfishness. Only then will the future be bright.</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion: Representatives from the Municipal Party Department, Mao Yun, and the Social Affairs Bureau, Rao Qiangsheng, delivered speeches successively. Hu Guigeng gave a speech. Then, the association's charter was discussed and a general outline of the plan was adopted. The association's general association is located in Shanghai, and branch associations are established in Singapore, Batavia, Yangon, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other places. The New Yongding Construction Three-Year Plan covers six major plans: security, transportation, education, industry and commerce, hygiene, and agriculture and forestry, which are quite comprehensive.</p>

<h3>Verification of Self-Rehabilitated Opium Addicts; Twenty-Six Designated Hospitals</h3>
<p>Opium Addicts Willing to Pay Fees Should Go to Various Hospitals for Examination as Soon as Possible; Those Unable to Pay Fees Will Be Sent to Drug Rehabilitation Centers for Verification</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau is handling the registration of opium addicts. Previously, the number of opium addicts who applied for self-rehabilitation was very large. It is difficult to determine whether their rehabilitation is genuine. The bureau is deeply concerned that cunning individuals may use the name of self-rehabilitation to secretly smoke opium, which would be a profound malpractice. The bureau has drafted measures and notified all subordinate units that opium addicts who apply for self-rehabilitation must be examined by a hospital designated by the Health Bureau to obtain a certificate and submit a pledge not to smoke opium again, all of which should be submitted to the bureau for record. If they commit opium smoking again, the bureau may send them to a temporary drug rehabilitation center for verification at any time. The bureau had previously requested the Health Bureau to designate various hospitals to undertake this opium cessation examination work. It has now been learned that a reply has been received from the Health Bureau yesterday, designating a total of twenty-six hospitals. Upon receiving the reply, the bureau immediately ordered all sub-bureaus to notify all opium addicts who are voluntarily undergoing rehabilitation that those who are willing to pay fees may go to the Municipal Opium Cessation Hospital and the designated hospitals for examination to obtain a certificate and submit it to the bureau for record. Those who are unable to pay fees will be summoned to the bureau for transfer to the Municipal Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center for verification. It is also heard that in order to facilitate general opium addicts who voluntarily undergo rehabilitation, the bureau intends to send a letter to the Health Bureau requesting that the fees for opium cessation and examination be charged by the designated hospitals at a minimum limit. The names and addresses of the registered hospitals designated by the Health Bureau are listed below:</p>

<h3>Zhao Anzhi Opens Painting Exhibition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Zhao Anzhi, a painter from Wujin, is from a prominent family in Lanling. In his youth, he was known for his scholarly achievements. In his spare time, he often used the court styles of the Song Dynasty as his model, incorporating the changes of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and integrating the achievements of various schools. He combined various schools into one, while still creating his own unique style. Whether he paints figures or landscapes, his images are always extraordinary. His meticulous paintings of flowers, birds, grasses, and insects are particularly famous for their gorgeous colors. In the spring of the 18th year, he was specially invited to exhibit his works at the National Art Exhibition, ranking among the best. In the winter of the 19th year, he won a gold medal at the Belgian Centennial Progress World Exposition. In the mid-spring of the 22nd year, he responded to the Chicago Exposition and received great praise from the people of that country. He participated again when it reopened the following year. In the early spring of the 23rd year, he responded to the invitation of the Sino-German Painting Exhibition and toured through England, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, France, and Czechoslovakia. Many of his works were purchased. It is hoped that his fame will rival that of great artists. This is not only the extension of his reputation in painting, but also a major event for our country internationally. Chu Minyi and others, considering that many men of letters have gathered in Beijing recently, specially advised him to display his fine works of the past ten years at the Martyrs' Shrine in the First Park of Nanjing for public exhibition for five days, from the 9th to the 13th of this month. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Rubber Industry—Zhengtai Rubber Factory—</h3>
<p>—Lou Lizhai</p>
<p>The rubber industry in our country is not only one of the emerging industries, but also the fastest-growing industry in recent years. The first people in our country to engage in this industry were in Guangzhou. Later, some people in Shanghai also engaged in it, and the speed of development has exceeded that of Guangzhou. In 1919, Shanghai had the Zhonghua Rubber Factory, which manufactured shoe soles. This was the beginning of the rubber industry in Shanghai. However, the factory only operated for one year and then closed down due to losses. After that, the Jiangwan Model Factory and others were established one after another, transitioning from manufacturing shoe soles to making galoshes. They rose up like a storm, reaching their peak for a time. By 1931, it was even more developed. There were 48 rubber factories in the city, with a total capital of approximately 4 million yuan, 12,000 workers, and a total output value of over 10 million yuan. This was the most prosperous era of the Shanghai rubber industry in the past. However, the good times did not last long. The January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out, some factories were destroyed, production capacity declined, and foreign goods took the opportunity to dump their products, seizing the domestic market. After the war, the market was sluggish, sales were slow, and the turnover of working capital was inflexible. As a result, many factories closed down and stopped work one after another. After 1933, it became even more declining, with a tendency to go from bad to worse. By the first half of last year, only a dozen or so were able to maintain operation. By November, because too many factories had closed down, production decreased, and demand exceeded supply. The market gradually became active, so the factories that had stopped work resumed work one after another, and the future seems promising.</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. on September 30th, a group of five of us went to the Zhengtai Rubber Factory to visit the rubber industry. Mr. Yang Shaozhen and Mr. Hong Fumei of the factory warmly received us and first told us about the history of the factory.</p>
<p>The factory was established in 1926, with the factory site on Tangshan Road. It specializes in manufacturing Daxipai galoshes. Later, it was acquired by Panyi Chang Rubber Factory. At that time, the Wannianqing and Sanba brands of galoshes produced by Yichang were still produced by them. As business developed, the Tangshan Road factory was no longer sufficient, so a second factory was added on Dalianwan Road. The original factory on Tangshan Road was called the First Factory. In February 1933, the First Factory was destroyed by an electrical fire, and the loss of assets and inventory reached 200,000 yuan. The business losses are not included, which was truly a catastrophe for the factory. After that, the second factory expanded its scope and made every effort to reorganize. In terms of equipment, it sought safety and stability. In terms of production, because the sales of galoshes had gradually become sluggish at that time, it reduced production and stopped making Wannianqing and Sanba brand galoshes, and increased the production of Huili ball shoes to compete with the imported Redo basketball shoes. Recently, it has increased the production of Wanli shoes. "Wanli" is used to describe the sturdiness of the shoes, emphasizing that they will not break even if worn for ten thousand miles. After such a reorganization after the disaster, the factory is now gradually recovering its former appearance.</p>
<p>After Mr. Yang and Mr. Hong finished talking about the history of the factory, they led us to visit the production process.</p>
<p>The main raw material for galoshes, Huili ball shoes, and Wanli shoes is rubber. Rubber is made from the sap of the rubber tree. Rubber trees grow in the tropics. In our country, only Qiongyai produces it, but the quantity is very small and has not been developed. Therefore, the rubber used by various rubber factories is purchased from overseas. The rubber used by this factory is purchased from Singapore.</p>
<p>The purchased rubber is mixed with white powder mixed with lime, magnesium carbonate, and zinc white, sulfur, and other organic accelerators, and mixed with heat and pressure to make hot rubber. This rubber is divided into thick and thin types. The former is used for making shoe soles, and the latter is used for making shoe uppers.</p>
<p>To make galoshes, you only need to glue the thick and thin rubber to the inside, cut them into shoe soles and uppers, glue the soles and uppers together, and then polish and dry them. As for Huili ball shoes and Wanli shoes, it is more complicated. The inside of the upper must be glued to both sides of the thin rubber separately to make the upper, and the thick rubber must be cut into the sole with an electric knife. Then, the sole and upper are glued together and dried in a steaming room to complete the process. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Outsiders Opening and Closing are More Troublesome</h3>
<p>The financial trend is gradually stabilizing, and the market's Chinese and foreign interbank lending rates are gradually falling. Yesterday, it fell another small 0.02, to only 0.16. The clearing balance is sufficient, and it remains a white clearing throughout. The autumn sports half-day holiday for banks has passed, and yesterday they were open all day. The closing situation is relatively trivial and complex. Among money industry colleagues, the bill trading is gradually leveling off, and credit precautions have slightly eased. Yesterday, the transfer amount slightly increased, totaling over 4.2 million, with over 500,000 in new transactions, over 300,000 in noon market transactions, over 600,000 in small general assembly transactions, over 800,000 in foreign firm loan redemptions, and over 1.6 million in loans made. Among these, real estate was less, and securities and goods were more. Banknotes were still not recovered. The number of loans issued by local financial and foreign firms in exchange totaled over 3.5 million, with over 1.2 million shipped to other cities, including 100,000 in 1-yuan notes, 700,000 in 5-yuan notes, and 500,000 in 10-yuan notes. Money shops and foreign public bill closing totaled over 5.1 million, and foreign clearing balance closing totaled over 4.6 million, with over 600,000 in remittances from various routes. As for bank closing, foreign banks' closing totaled 3.3 million in bill funds, over 3.5 million in various goods exchange pledge miscellaneous funds, over 900,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 600,000 in special transfers, and over 900,000 in exchange settlement funds. Chinese banks' closing totaled over 3.3 million in bill funds, over 4.6 million in various goods exchange tax pledge miscellaneous funds, over 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 700,000 in special transfers, and over 1.4 million in exchange settlement funds (including last month's closing amount). Japanese banks' closing totaled over 3.2 million in bill funds, over 3.4 million in various goods exchange miscellaneous funds, over 800,000 in special transfers, and over 600,000 in telegraphic transfers. The amount of exchange settlement funds is unknown due to the settlement of the Japanese exchange rate. Furthermore, the total number of checks cleared by the clearing house on the 7th was 23,930,709.90 yuan in national currency, including a total of 18,250,399.30 yuan in clearing, a total of 3,594,878.71 yuan in collections for money shops, and 2,085,431.89 yuan in collections for others.</p>
<h3>Auxiliary Coins Traded at Twelve Jiao on the Black Market</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the legal tender system, the market price of auxiliary coins has been discussed by Minister Kong, who stipulated a uniform market price to avoid confusing the market situation. Therefore, since the 4th, it has been repeatedly stipulated that each 12 jiao of silver coins is equivalent to 1 yuan, and each 3,000 copper coins is equivalent to 1 yuan. Unexpectedly, small money shops have recently been heavily involved in black market trading, opening up boards and making deals in the market at prices that deviate from the fixed market price of 12 jiao. The price decreased by 0.01 the day before yesterday to 11.9 jiao, and increased by 0.02 yesterday morning to 12.1 jiao. It decreased by 0.006 in the afternoon to 12.004 jiao. The industry leaders in the money business believe that the small money shops are not members of the same industry association, so they are not concerned and ignore the issue. However, if this continues, it is bound to disrupt the market situation of auxiliary coin manipulation.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Worsening in All Three Sessions</h3>
<p>--Declines Ranging from Over One Yuan to Over Three Yuan--</p>
<p>The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market still has not stabilized yesterday. Because the rumors have not subsided, the long positions sold off. The market conditions were rather weak. Throughout the day, in all three sessions, market prices worsened. This is also a reaction to the large increases of many days, and there is nothing particularly profound about it. The majority of the demobilization long positions have concentrated in house number 78, with a total transaction volume of over 10 million. The long positions of house number 78 alone accounted for over 8 million. Apart from the demobilization positions, the other various positions were mostly short positions, amounting to several million. The largest long positions were still in house number 48, totaling approximately 16 million. House number 16 had the largest short positions, with a transaction value of over 92 million. Market price prospects are very volatile, especially the fluctuations of public bonds, which are the most significant. The course of yesterday was as follows: in the morning session, houses 43, 51, 54, and 69 were all selling, with the Northern Clique making some purchases, while houses 48 and 78 were all buying. The entire 61 item was sold by house number 48. Market prices declined sharply, from 8 or 9 jiao to 2.5 yuan. Demobilization bonds declined by 1.9 yuan, and short-term gold bonds declined the most, by 2.5 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, demobilization bonds fell another 1.8 yuan, and the rest also fell by a small number of jiao to over 1 yuan. The Northern Clique and house number 16 sold bravely. Before the final session, because houses 43 and 54 and others were buying vigorously, the market rebounded slightly by about 3 or 5 jiao. Since the forward market rotated, the Northern Clique and house number 33 and others sold, uniformly turning to declines. Short-term gold bonds fell sharply again by 1 yuan. House number 48 uniquely advanced with the entire 6, still falling by half a yuan. The results of market prices were consistent declines, apart from the 18 Customs bonds, ranging from over 1 yuan to over 3 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be approximately 30 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>
<h3>New York Industrial Stocks Reached Repeated Peaks</h3>
<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market rose by 1 to 4 yuan yesterday (the 6th), with extremely active trading. New peaks were reached repeatedly for industrial stocks. Utility stocks and railroad stocks also advanced uniformly. Automotive stocks and steel stocks were particularly strong. Traders' initial interpretation of the election results was that they represented a condemnation of Roosevelt's New Deal. Small exchange stocks and the bond market also rose. The total trading volume for the day was 2.08 million shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>|             | 4th     | 6th     | Change |</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Reaction in Yarn and Cotton is Also Fierce</h3>
<p>--A Large Number of Securities Firms are Selling--</p>
<p>The yarn market has fallen drastically, and the declines are severe. Previously, the upward trend was wild and violent, but now the reaction is also fierce. The local authorities in this city have strictly cracked down on raising prices, and public sentiment in the market has calmed down. As the market sentiment leveled out, floating long positions were sold off. It was also reported that public bonds had turned down, and securities firms were selling in large quantities, causing further public panic. The market price then plummeted in a straight line, with this month's prices breaking through the 90 yuan barrier.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices for This Month Break Below 90 Yuan</p>
<p>The opening prices for standard yarn in the forward market declined uniformly, and a slight downward trend began. The local authorities in this city have strictly cracked down on raising prices, and public sentiment has become more stable. As a result, buying interest has been calm. Each month fell by 1.7, 8 jiao. During the second and third trading sessions, Changfeng continued to try to pull up prices, rebounding slightly. However, by the closing, the prices had resumed their downward trend. As a result, each month fell by 1.4, 6, 7 jiao to 2 yuan. The downward trend was even more intense when the market opened in the afternoon. It was said that securities firms were spitting out long positions, and Tongji made some offers. At the same time, rumors also arose, all of which were beneficial to short positions. Retail investors competed to sell off, and market prices became more difficult to support, declining step by step. The 42-count thread prices on the warehouse receipts plummeted by 10 yuan. The decline this month was particularly severe. As a result, near-month prices fell by 4.4 jiao to 3.7 yuan compared to the morning closing prices, and far-month prices fell by 1.7 and 8 jiao. Upon inspection, Tongji sold 1,300 bales, Daji 1,550 bales, Gengfeng 1,700 bales, Xincheng 1,100 bales, Yuda 650 bales, Jinchang 1,100 bales, and Changfeng 800 bales. Dafu bought 1,100 bales, Ruidai 2,900 bales, Dachangcheng 1,500 bales, Changfeng 2,200 bales, Runkang 1,100 bales, Dafeng 750 bales, Shenji 1,700 bales, and Tonghe 550 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>The Market for Spot Goods is Dull</p>
<p>Due to the sharp decline in the futures yarn market, the buying interest of various firms has turned sluggish. Upon investigation, the statistics for the total purchases of spot goods by various firms for the day are only 368 bales. Prices fell by 2 yuan, thread prices fell by 4 yuan, and thread warehouse receipt prices fell by 10 yuan. The purchase amounts for various firms are as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland 200, Hankou 15, Colleagues 77</p>
<p>Ningbo 16, Changsha 50, Nanjing 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending weak. This month, due to Tongzhou spot cotton merchants heavily selling short in batches for days, the market outlook has become loose. Near-month prices are weak, and far-month prices have been dragged down. The outbound route for spot cotton is blocked, while the sources are relatively strong. Generally, floating traders, recognizing the unfavorable situation, have been selling off in succession. Tongji long positions have also been making offers. Public sentiment is increasingly affected, and market prices are trending lower.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao and Yuanxing Chang Sold Short</p>
<p>The opening prices for standard cotton in the forward market declined sharply for the near-month contracts. Because Dafu has been heavily selling short in batches for days, with amounts reaching 23,000 dans, the floor has been quite loose. Far-month prices have been dragged into the vortex. Market prices have been increasingly suppressed. Although Changhe and Ruidai have been purchasing in large quantities, the Ningbo firms Yuanxing Chang have been selling short even more vigorously. As a result, each month's closing price was higher than the previous day's closing price by 7 jiao to 1.1 jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, rumors arose, stating that there were 23,000 dans of spot cotton, and the banks were unwilling to provide loan security. There was a lack of receivers, and at the same time, the cotton yarn prices were falling, making the cotton market decline even more sharply. As a result, each month's prices fell by 0.25 jiao to 0.4 and 6 jiao compared to the morning closing prices. Upon investigation, Yuanyi sold 2,200 dans, Yuanxing Chang 19,300 dans, Changfeng 6,500 dans, Runkang 4,600 dans, Yongda 2,400 dans, Yicheng 2,000 dans, Taixing 5,400 dans, Daji 3,200 dans, Dafeng 2,900 dans, Tongji 3,800 dans, Dafu 2,700 dans, Senkang 2,000 dans, and Jinchang 1,800 dans. Ruidai bought 12,700 dans, Changhe 17,800 dans, Yichang 2,500 dans, Yikang 2,100 dans, Xincheng 4,700 dans, Runkang 3,900 dans, Changfeng 2,300 dans, Dafu 4,500 dans, Tongji 3,100 dans, Yuanda 2,900 dans, and Tongxing 1,600 dans.

<h3>Reduced Collection of Special Guarantees for Yarn and Cotton</h3>

<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced the revised legal tender issue, the markets in various industries have been trending towards stability. The Yarn and Cotton Exchange will reduce the increase in the collection of special guarantees for standard yarn and cotton by half starting tomorrow. The collection for cotton yarn will be changed from 16 yuan to 8 yuan per bale, and the collection for cotton will be changed from 6 yuan to 3 yuan per dan. Both deposit accounts will be charged one-sidedly.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Yarn and Cotton Prices Also Soared</h3>
<p>Yarn Jumped 5.6 Yuan - Cotton Jumped 2 Yuan</p>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) Since the Ministry of Finance announced the policy of replacing cash with banknotes, the cotton industry market in this city has suddenly become tense. The cotton market principles have been firm and strong. This surge has been particularly intense. The black market price for fine-staple cotton is stubbornly high. Coarse-staple cotton from Xihe jumped 2 yuan. Japanese firms have been vigorously advancing. Yisheng Sanchang Firm purchased 730 bales, with an opening price of 42 yuan. Matsumoto Firm purchased 100 bales, and Qingxi Firm purchased 200 bales, with opening prices all at 42 yuan. Furthermore, the market prices for cotton yarn have soared even more.

<h3>American Cotton Actively Rises After Holiday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened actively. Prices rose because of frost in the southwest region, positive news from Liverpool, and a strong stock market. After the close of overseas markets, some long positions were liquidated and southern hedging took place, resulting in a slight reaction. Consequently, spot prices increased by 10 points, and futures prices increased by 7 to 12 points. British cotton spot and futures both increased by 1 point. Indian cotton market was calm, slightly weak due to local sellers. Pingle and Bai Luo Xi fell by half a rupee, and Oumula remained unchanged. Original telegram from Luozuo (dated 6th).</p>

<h3>Rumor of Foreign Merchants Purchasing Spot Grain, Flour Futures Rebound Strongly</h3>
<p>The flour market opened calmly in the morning. Although foreign ports reported good prices of 2.25 to 2.3, the market sentiment was mostly wait-and-see due to limited targets. Only this month had slightly more demand, up 7.5 cents, while the rest fluctuated by only about half a cent. By the afternoon opening, near and deferred contracts gradually became more expensive again. There were rumors that foreign merchants purchased 20,000 bags of spot goods to be shipped to Xiamen. As a result, trading had improved, and speculators also took advantage of it to buy in. Compared with the previous day, prices rebounded by 3, 4, and 5 cents. As for the exchange, because the market has gradually calmed down in recent days, special margins have been canceled. From now on, the margin for both buyers and sellers will only be 250 yuan.</p>

<p>The wheat market saw sluggish trading in the morning. Market sentiment was stable, and prices for each month were roughly the same as the previous day. However, by the afternoon opening, near and deferred contracts suddenly rose sharply again. This was due to rumors in the market that the external situation was about to change, and news that Eastern merchants were paying attention to grain prices. Furthermore, the rebound in flour prices greatly boosted market buying. Deferred contracts, which had fallen sharply the previous day, rebounded strongly yesterday, with prices for January and later contracts all rising by over 10 cents. Spot wheat remained stable. Kaishan Dongxi Ping wheat was 4.8 yuan, Daqiao wheat was 4.8 yuan, and secondary was 7.9 cents. Guandian wheat was 4.79 yuan, Shaoxing wheat was 4.68 yuan. Xin Da and Shen Da each sold 600 bags.</p>

<h3>He Xia Rice's Declining Trend Stabilizes</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the origin of various brokers was nearly 60 (goods totaling more than 12,000 dan). After seeing vitality during midday, yesterday's opening was ordinary. Brokers handling Tianjin and other regions continued to handle nearly 1,000 bags. The prices of various goods slightly increased, showing a pattern of large declines and small rebounds. Early new indica rice increased by 12 cents, while thin new increased slightly. Dujian high angle was permissible, but the evening market remained wait-and-see. Broken rice, due to seasonal and other factors, showed no glory or disgrace. Foreign round rice alone had difficulty standing due to slow sales. Yinyuan was flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The origin was quite strong, about 60 to 70. The market's various goods were being consumed, and the morning market for new indica rice continued to move. Prices were high and materials were firm. Middle and secondary grades increased by 12 cents. At midday, another slight easing trend emerged. Yangdu and Bujian were still not bad for separate dismantling, and prices were also firm. Baige closely held near corners. Late rice was stabilizing, kiln seeds were sluggish. New and old changing yuan sold sluggishly, prices were slightly lower by 12 cents. Custom tip slightly took, other goods didn't have much rise and fall.</p>
<h3>Customer Indica Rice Initially Falls, Then Rises</h3>
<p>Fluctuations Reach 56 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for customer indica rice were quite varied. The market opened in the morning continuing the previous day's downward trend. Market sentiment was very weak, and arrivals gradually increased. Stockholders were nervous and sought to sell. All rice suddenly fell by 23 cents. The decline in Jiangxi early rice was even sharper, with prices suddenly falling by 56 cents, nearly 1.5 yuan lower than the highest price a few days ago. However, this was a sell-off by floating stockholders and not an official market. By midday, there were many rumors in the market, such as stockpiling by a certain party or collection by a certain country. Although these were completely unconfirmed rumors, market sentiment had been stirred. Retail sales in this street were booming, and retailers were purchasing from wholesalers. Trading was particularly active, and prices were rising step by step, already 34 cents higher than the morning's low price. Taizhou Liu indica rice was quoted at 10.06 yuan in the afternoon, but was not sold. At this price, it would be up more than 6 cents. Throughout the day, 6,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 500 bags of Ningbo rice, 4,800 bags of Wenzhou and Taizhou rice, and 1,200 bags of Hankou rice were sold. 800 bags of Saigon foreign rice were also sold, initially priced at 11.05 yuan, but later rose to 11.2 yuan. All were bought by this street.</p>
<h3>Tea Sales Weaken Due to Shortage of Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market for foreign firms was slightly quiet. European firms were still in high demand for high-quality Zhenmei and Mazhu green teas due to active overseas routes. However, the inventory of each tea warehouse was exhausted, and there were no goods available for the market. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson, Concordia, China Tea, and Yongxing foreign firms purchased a total of more than 500 boxes of Zhenmei, Mei Shrimp Eyes, Xi, and Qimen black tea. The market was generally stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Sales Decline, Brown Sugar Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend remained flat. The guild's market price for 25 coarse sand white spot was 22 yuan, and transit goods were 6.9 yuan, but no transactions were made. Zhenji No. 1 refined white sugar from this factory was 21.2 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were sold according to rebates. Dong Chi and Dong Bai were both quoted at the original price without success. However, the price of transit goods slightly decreased. YT mark was 6.75 yuan, and URP mark was 6.45 yuan, with some transactions. Only over 100 bags of domestic Chaoqing were released, Gao Huanggang Qing at 11.8 yuan. The other Diao Qing, etc., were still in negotiations and have not yet been released.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Honey Dates Turn Upward Due to Low Inventory</h3>
<p>Although honey dates have recently experienced a slow sales period, there are not many inventories in the market. Owners are guarding their goods and selling less, so market prices have rebounded. Yesterday, the market price was 28 yuan for Zheng Gong Tutu Xing, and 24 yuan for Lanxi goods. Upper and lower grades were routinely rebated. The trend is stable.</p>
<h3>Metals, Door Number 5 and 6 White Lead Sheets Are in Great Shortage</h3>
<p>No. 5 and 6 white lead sheets are essential for battery factories. Since overseas prices have soared, local peers have rushed to hoard and speculate. However, battery factories are actively purchasing, so the circulating goods are in danger of being exhausted. The price per barrel has increased from 28 yuan to 30 yuan, and recently opened at 32 yuan. However, there is a large shortage of inventory, so the public demands 34 yuan to sell. It is reported that Yaohua and Huiming and other battery factories reluctantly made transactions yesterday, selling 15 or 16 barrels at a price of 34 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, No. 2 and 3 opened at 30 yuan, No. 4 at 29.75 yuan, and No. 7 and above at 32.2 yuan, but the trading volume is not as active as No. 5 and 6.</p>

<h3>Evening in Sha Wan</h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>I hadn't expected to stay in Hong Kong. The forced stay made me stubbornly irritated. Although I had just come out of a village of fewer than ten houses and should have been quite used to solitude, I couldn't deceive my loneliness with quietude in a city with hundreds of thousands of residents. Seeing people on the road greeting each other, or even just exchanging a smile without greeting, I felt a bit jealous. I often went out for walks but would dejectedly run back, only to run out again soon after, always hoping to run into someone I knew and act out the comedy of meeting an old friend in a foreign land. This expectation was somewhat possible. When passing through Wuzhou, I had heard that someone had gone to Hong Kong, and someone else would be going soon. Because I wasn't very familiar with these people, I didn't pay much attention during the hurried passage. Now, I couldn't help but regret it. Actually, even if I had paid attention at the time and made a special visit according to the address, it would have been quite abrupt. I still hoped to run into them on the road and be able to casually greet them. Even if they saw me and greeted me faintly, I would still have to return to my solitude. So, while I eagerly wanted to meet an acquaintance, I was also worried, hoping that the reality would destroy my hope.</p>
<p>Taking the ferry to pass the time had become a habit in my daily life. The four-cent fare carried me on a forty- or fifty-minute voyage, and it could restore the fatigue after wandering for a long time, allowing me to start a new wandering on the other side. During my stay in Hong Kong, I spent much more time in Kowloon on the opposite shore than in Hong Kong. Kowloon's orderly roads were easier to recognize than Hong Kong, and there were no surging crowds. Sometimes, it was even deserted and more suitable for my state of mind at the time. I don't know how many times I had walked along Nathan Road and Prince Edward Road. Because I always came by ferry from Sham Shui Po, I would walk along these two roads to Kowloon City and take the ferry back. If I came by ferry from Kowloon City, I would reverse the route. Ferry rides and walking often took up an entire afternoon. Once, I landed at Kowloon City and, because I went to play at Sung Wong Toi, I lingered for a long time. Afraid that it would be too late to walk to Sham Shui Po, I took a tram. This way, I arrived slightly earlier than usual. Unwilling to return to Hong Kong just yet, I watched people fishing with nets at the pier. These fishermen were selling their catch at any time. The method was also very peculiar. Because every net was sure to catch something, they set the price of each net of fish at one cent, regardless of the quantity. Whoever paid first got the fish that came up in that net. In this way, buyers could try their luck for that one cent. I could say that I was lured by the gambling spirit and also spent one cent. And I was actually very lucky, getting an unprecedented amount. So, I was envied and talked about by other buyers. This made me feel that I could be considered not an unfamiliar person among them.</p>
<p>But this sudden sense of belonging gradually embarrassed me. I had now taken my luck and walked away, but I had no way to deal with this pile of small fish. I didn't have anything to carry them in. So, someone gave me a newspaper. But where could I carry them wrapped in a newspaper? So, I continued to stare blankly at the small fish, holding the newspaper. In this way, my actions at this time became more of a center of attention than the fish in the fisherman's net. I felt that the people around me were gradually increasing, or perhaps even those outside the circle felt that something strange had happened inside the circle. I really hoped that these fish caught from the sea could return to the sea. But I realized that pushing them back would attract even more attention. So, I was forced to accept this luck. Luckily, I ran into an acquaintance at this time.</p>
<p>It was Ms. C. She had just returned on the ferry. She had come to take a look because there was a crowd gathered here. When she saw it was me, she couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. I don't remember how she asked in surprise at the time, but I took the opportunity to answer and immediately escape the crowd, calling C to walk away. I don't know how that pile of fish ended up. I'm afraid someone still remembers this small oddity.</p>
<p>C was a student of my friend's. I hadn't met her many times before, but she greeted me with such warmth, which I later learned was because my friend often mentioned me. I don't know how vividly and brilliantly my friend depicted my boring and chaotic school life in Shanghai to them. Students in the inland areas often see Shanghai as an ideal world, admiring the modern city, hating the inland areas, and constantly looking for opportunities to run to the city. It's good to be able to go to Shanghai, but if not, they think of Guangzhou or Hong Kong. This illusory ideal often changes a person's character, making it impossible for them to stay in the inland, so they have to go even if they don't have the chance. Naturally, these dreams often shatter, and shattering may not be unlucky, but it's always painful while it's happening.</p>
<p>C's living situation, I don't know if she thought I knew or if she didn't want to say much, she only briefly mentioned where she lived. It was time to go back, so she invited me to sit there, but when she got to the door, she suddenly changed her mind and invited me to see that friend she had mentioned on the road who lived in Cheung Sha Wan. Although I didn't know her friend, because of her strong persuasion, I had agreed on the road to go see her one day. Suddenly she changed it to that day, and I couldn't think of a reason to refuse. So, I followed her towards Nathan Road.</p>
<p>Nathan Road and Cheung Sha Road are connected. They are divided by a cross street, seemingly for no particular reason. Probably just because the following are newly opened virgin lands with few inhabitants. I had never walked this Cheung Sha Road before. C told me it was still a main road leading to the countryside. There was a bay in the middle that was a good place for swimming. We could have gone to take a look, but her friend lived very far away, so we had to take a streetcar. After taking the streetcar to the terminus, we still walked for about twenty minutes to reach her friend's house. In the vast twilight, stood several decaying houses. C walked familiarly up the stairs of the middle one, called out at the door of the second floor. A haggard middle-aged woman walked out. C called her "Auntie," and invited me in with her. The middle-aged woman looked at me for a moment, but didn't say anything. A young man resembling a worker was standing in the hallway, but he dodged into the back room when he saw people coming. C's friend had not yet come out. When C led me into the front room, I could see that she had obviously just finished tidying up some odds and ends.</p>
<p>Probably she was about to ask C who I was, but C asked me first, "Do you recognize her?" This question made me confused. Originally, I knew that we were visiting Ms. L's sister, but at this time, I couldn't help but suspect that C had deliberately fabricated the story, or that it was actually L herself. I couldn't tell the difference in appearance, so I couldn't answer. C laughed, and this L also laughed. At the same time, she seemed to realize who I was. She told me her name and said that she had heard her sister say that I was going to come to see her. Then C laughed again. Probably she was satisfied with her trickery, so she explained the situation of meeting me. She told her that she could learn about my friend's recent situation from me, and also said that I was very interested in the coastal reclamation project, so it would be good to take me to see the reclamation project by the way.</p>
<p>Probably the woman called "Auntie" was busy preparing something in the back. C went to the back to stop her, and then came back to suggest taking a walk by the coast. As soon as we went out, she told me that this house used to be right on the coast, but now hundreds of yards of land have been reclaimed outside. She was very clear about the process and method of reclamation, but she could only speculate about the intentions and methods of the Hong Kong government. This allowed me to roughly guess her circumstances, but I didn't ask her directly, and I didn't ask C about it later. However, C later told me that the worker-like man was L's husband. Their marriage had been arranged since childhood. Neither of them expected that L would eventually accept this blind marriage. She didn't know the situation at the time of the wedding, but she knew that L didn't regret or feel uneasy now, which she always found a bit strange. When C spoke these words, she completely changed her usual lively attitude. Every word she said seemed to carry a bit of pain, making me think that C brought me to see L's home, or was using L's home to show off her own.</p>
<p>Although no one said anything about themselves that evening in Sha Wan, the impression left was very dark, just like the twilight in memory. Ms. L's life was simply like being buried. Her younger sister later became an idolized beauty due to different paths. And the older sister is probably buried in Sha Wan forever. I had a chance to see little L again by chance, but in the extreme hurry, I didn't have time to ask about her sister. And Ms. C has long been truly buried underground. Is the scenery of Sha Wan still the same?</p>

<h3>Impressions of the Tokyo Autumn Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Fang Xun</p>
<p>After arriving in Tokyo, the autumn art exhibitions have unfolded before us with a kind of inertia.</p>
<p>The autumn art season is usually centered on the "Teiten" (Imperial Art Exhibition), but this year, due to the dispute over the reorganization of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, the exhibition has been postponed to next year. Therefore, the "Nika" (Second Section Society) exhibition, which was originally considered "unofficial," has taken the lead in this art season. On an afternoon that was as gloomy as early winter, I walked through the Ueno forest and took a turn in the not very crowded venue. Here, please allow me to presumptuously quote a sentence from Heine: "I want to avoid as much as possible criticisms of technical strengths and weaknesses. ... It may be more meaningful to simply write a little about the themes and meanings of these paintings." (Heine: French painter)</p>
<p>Speaking of themes, it seems that a newspaper review said that the characteristic of this year's "Nika" is that the themes are relatively broad. In addition to stereotypical nudes, still lifes, and suburban landscapes, it has gradually begun to seek "cause and effect" in the various aspects of city life. But I want to add that in addition to these various aspects of city life, and very much in line with this "extraordinary time," Japanese painters have already begun to "seek cause and effect in the various aspects of colonial life"! Examples that can be readily cited include Shin Kurihara's "Summer Lama Pagoda," "Summer Manchuria," Jiro Fujii's "Weaving Factory" and "Vegetable Seller" set against the background of Beiping, Kaoruaki Yamao's "Woman with a Natara Pot" with a South Seas theme, and Seigo Taguchi's "Opium Smoking Picture" (two works), "Watching a Play," Tsuguharu Fujita's "Wrestler in Beiping," etc. This shows that although Japanese painters, as Heine (cited above) said, "are far removed from and separate from serious social movements," they have not yet "recognized the uselessness of their cooperation" (of course, the aspect of this cooperation is the opposite of what Heine is referring to)! Secondly, we feel that the surrealist works that have historically dominated Nika, which want to beautify this ugly world and indulge themselves in this beauty, have gradually cooled down, and even from their point of view, there are few noteworthy works. At the same time, what we find interesting is that these writers can strangely still see a gradual transition to applied art. As for the established masters, such as Tokusaburo Masamune, Tokutaro Takaoka, Saburo Miyamoto, Ton Shimizu, ... we can only say that their technology is becoming more and more consummate, but on the contrary, they are also "gradually losing boldness and strength"! Masamune's "Waves," Takaoka's "Woman," and Shimizu's "Sleeping Mother and Child" are all masterpieces of this year, but they only dazzle our eyes with their masterful brushwork and colors. Of course, these works will not give you any sense of the pulse and excitement of the times. By the way, this year's Nika selected many works by Chinese artists, especially the works of Kim Hak-seong (three pieces) and Jiang Zhimin in the sculpture department, which have won considerable praise. However, when I passed through Room 6 (Sculpture), I don't know for what reason, Mr. Jiang Zhimin's somewhat ancient-style headless male statue was being displayed in front of Yoshitomo Watanabe's "Japanese Sword"! This is truly an accidental satire.</p>

<h3>Debt (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>Like this, my debt was also built up high, spreading in all directions. I still didn't have the patience to wait for this disease to slowly wear away. I cursed my unhealthy body, in the dark night, in the deep night. I was unwilling to pour the money that my friends had also gotten with difficulty onto the disease. What's the use of fertilizer for a tree that has already rotted at the roots?</p>
<p>My debt collector is my life. I no longer cherish it, no longer try to keep it, with the mindset of "killing it off"!</p>
<p>However, I breathed again, I recovered.</p>
<p>I was able to walk slowly, to step out of the threshold. That ray of blue sky was a stranger to me, a miracle.</p>
<p>My friends congratulated me with kind smiles. At this time, I suddenly remembered: My responsibility is coming!</p>
<p>There are still unfinished debts coming! Although I'm not a shameless rascal, this ray of blue sky and a piece of cloud darkened the leaves of my heart again.</p>
<p>I work, I plod through the streets and alleys again.</p>
<p>In desperation, the big "Pawn" character on the white wall on the street caught my listless eyes, my savior!</p>
<p>However, I didn't have the courage to look around at that high counter.</p>
<p>"What else can I sell?" I often turn over the two messy boxes, calculating how much debt there is, so I tighten the belt and save, and scold the five months of illness fiercely.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think: It's still fortunate to have debt to borrow. In this world, there are tens of thousands of people seeking loans without success. Who do you blame?</p>
<p>Debt saves people, and also forces people to death. The threat of the world is expanding before my eyes. (End)</p>
<h3>Ancestral Shrine of Brother and Sister</h3>
<p>— Wu Rangsan</p>
<p>Many love stories circulate among the common people of Guangdong. In the simple narratives of the farmers, some are tragic and moving. Regarding this, a friend named Liu Li, who wanders through various villages and county towns, knows a great deal. Once, to encourage a pair of timid lovers, he told them the story of the "Ancestral Shrine of Brother and Sister."</p>
<p>Usually, when Liu Li talks about the customs of various places, I can almost touch with my hand his genuine love for the people of those villages. His love is vast and universal. Without concealing any personal preferences, he loves everyone, without distinguishing between the intelligent and the foolish.</p>
<p>The story begins at Yugu Hill along the West River.</p>
<p>Beside the river in that village, there is an ancestral shrine of brother and sister. The villagers deeply respect and boast about it. The shrine is dedicated to a pair of cousins, the male named Yu Qing, and the female named He Mingzhu, both from the same village. Thirty years ago, they loved each other passionately, but their fathers held generations of hatred and were constantly determined to destroy their dreams. He Mingzhu was the leader among the female singers, but after a hearty and satisfying singing session with her beloved, she was confined by her family.</p>
<p>At that time, the village elders became anxious, worrying about what disasters might occur; the young men went mad, because someone had taken away their idol. The Yu and He families were wealthy and powerful, each harboring an equal number of thugs and storing an equal amount of weapons.</p>
<p>A shocking news spread from the darkness, Mingzhu was pregnant for the first time. Mingzhu's father convened a clan meeting at the He ancestral hall, and he himself proposed to put Mingzhu in a pig cage and drown her in the river, and he personally carried out this cruel punishment.</p>
<p>Yu Ming refused all persuasion and sang a lament by the river for three days and three nights, then stabbed his cruel father with a dagger. To avoid a senseless and tragic armed conflict, he found the place where Mingzhu was drowned and sank himself. No one dared to go into the water to retrieve them, nor had anyone seen their floating corpses. Except for the songs, they never left a trace on Yugu Hill. … The story ends here.</p>
<p>Among those who listened to the story, the washermen A Han and A Xi smiled with a strong expression, and in intimate joy, they merged with the free souls of those two ancient southern barbarians. The timid lovers: the male's monkey-like small face was excitedly flushed, his eyes turbid and flickering, lamenting his own insignificance. The female was completely entranced, as if she had lost her sight and hearing, paralyzed and motionless.</p>
<h3>Boileau on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>Recently, I read a Japanese translation of "The Art of Poetry" by the 17th-century French poet Boileau, and I found some of the points to be quite incisive. Originally, this is a famous work that arose from Aristotle's "Poetics", so saying that there are some incisive points here might seem a bit disrespectful. But my meaning is that some of his words can be used as criticism for modern Chinese new poetry, and they are very insightful. Generally, any classic book that makes people happy must have two reasons. One is: "It deeply resonates with my heart." The other is: It can satirize the "fashions" for the reader. I like this book of poetics for the second reason. The Japanese translation of the poetics has a good explanation of Boileau's thoughts, which I will now excerpt and translate:</p>
<p>"This book has four chapters. Half of it discusses general lessons (Chapter One discusses literary lessons, and Chapter Four discusses moral lessons.) The other half discusses the style of poetry. (Chapter Three discusses the three major styles: epic, tragedy, and comedy. Chapter One discusses various short forms of poetry.) Except for the first two sections of Chapter One, which can be seen as an introduction to the whole book and discuss genius, the whole book is permeated with one spirit. What is this spirit? It is the respect for reason. Looking first at Chapter One, the focus of the entire chapter of more than two hundred lines is the following two lines of poetry, “…Love reason! The works of you gentlemen should always borrow their splendor and appearance from reason.” (Section Three) The following seventy lines or so (up to Section Ten) are all elaborations of his doctrine of reason. Avoid seeking bizarre ideas, avoid falling into redundancy, avoid monotony of style, respect elegant taste, pay attention to the form of poetry; these are his main points. … But what exactly is the reason (also called good sense) that Boileau is talking about? Here we should think of the influence of Descartes' philosophy on Boileau's aesthetics. For example, Boileau often says: There is no beauty outside of it. This is entirely Descartes' idea. Because Descartes said that beauty is a form of impersonal reason. However, Boileau's reason is not the pure reason of Descartes. It is a mixture of the modern progressive Cartesian reason and the timid ancient respect for thought since the Renaissance. … Originally, Boileau, just a fastidious citizen, could not have the lofty reason and spiritual independence of someone like Descartes. His reason is somewhat hesitant and humble. He would rather love elegant and upright poetic qualities than unrestrained poetic style and profound poetic beauty. … Boileau uses the alternate name of "good sense" (meaning good judgment) for reason, and he believes, just like Descartes, that good sense is "the best distributor in the world." Under the name of good sense, he vigorously promotes the naturalness and simplicity, perfection and harmony of art, and vigorously promotes the imitation of antiquity. This statement is the statement of the entire French classicism. His contribution lies in combining literary thought with Descartes' theories, giving it a philosophical foundation, and strengthening the foundation of classicism to facilitate its spread..."</p>
<p>This section of explanation gives us two impressions. Boileau requires the fulfillment of reason in the content of literature and art. In its form, he is a classicist. Such a book of poetics is bound to be considered too square. Perhaps some will say that he is a Western "Way-Bearing" faction. But in reality, when I can't understand the impressionist poems written by some people, I would rather recite the ancient poems of "Way-Bearing" people such as Du Fu. Leaving aside the form, I feel that the content is also more solid. At least those people have deeply experienced life. I don't understand inspiration very well. If inspiration can be interpreted as a poet's response to things, then the poet should always have a personality to respond to things. Personality is probably the expression of consciousness (perhaps it can be said to be reason). Then Boileau's words have a basis. And for poets who advocate writing "naturally" poems, it is not without benefit. He said: "Whether you choose an interesting poetic subject, a sublime poetic subject, or any poetic subject, be sure to make good sense always harmonize with rhyme. Although these two seem mutually exclusive, rhyme is subservient. … Under the yoke of reason, rhyme becomes obedient and submissive. … You gentlemen love reason! The works of you gentlemen must always borrow their splendor and appearance from reason. Many people in the world, entirely because they are born with a blood that lacks distinction, often seek their poetic thoughts in a direction far from correct knowledge. In those bizarre poems, if the thoughts contained in them are thoughts that others can think of, they will think that they have lost their reputation. We must not fall into such extreme heresy." He also said: "I am afraid that a shortcoming will instead fall into a big shortcoming, which is often the case. For example, in order to avoid a certain sentence from being too weak, it is made stiff; in order to avoid redundancy, the meaning is unclear." Although these are all very ordinary common sense, they are also the most difficult things to achieve. At the same time, he also said that writing poetry must be popular. In Section Seven, he said: "If you want the public to like it, when writing, you should change the tone from time to time. If the poetic form is too flat or always monotonous, it is useless no matter how brilliant it is. It will definitely put the reader to sleep." He also said: "In poetry, it is fortunate for a poet to be able to shift from seriousness to gentleness with a light and harmonious voice, and from humor to severity. The writings of such a person are loved by heaven and loved by readers." He hates those who write poetry as a game the most. He said: "No matter what you write, never fall into vulgarity. Even vulgar-style poems still have considerable character. Only shameless playwrights, who despise good sense, first deceive the eyes of others, with novelty and cynicism. From then on, the world only sees vulgar illustrations, and the grammatical violations specifically denounced in poetic works are completely unrestricted." Here he condemns affectation and vulgar contempt. What he requires of poets is reason. What is reasonable is true. In Chapter Three, Section Five, he said: "Unreal things can never be seen by the audience. Of course, sometimes real things seem unreal. But unreasonable strange things have no charm for me. People will not be moved by things that even they themselves do not believe are real."</p>
<p>Looking at his poetic theory as a whole, it generally does not go beyond the following points. First, poetry must start from reason, abide by moral lessons, and not teach people to do evil. As in the fourth chapter, he shouts: "Writers, gentlemen, please listen to my instructions. If you gentlemen write works with rich imagination, and want everyone to love reading them, then your poems should be rich in good lessons and often accompany the solid and useful with the pleasant." "The minds and behaviors depicted in your works should show the noble posture of your character. If in poetry you do not know shame, lose your reputation, and write about things that violate virtue with deep guilt, making readers feel close to evil, I do not value such a dangerous writer at all." Therefore, even for inspiration in poetry, he believes that it must have good sense and reading as its foundation. (See Chapter Three, Section Twenty-Six) Second, poetry must have an orderly form and sonorous rhythm. In Chapter Two, he is entirely discussing the form of poetry. At the same time, he also said: "It is not impossible to skillfully choose harmonious words. Any full poetic sentence, noble poetic thought, that cannot be pleasing to the ear, will never please people." Third, in terms of the atmosphere of poetic creation, he advocates being happy rather than melancholy. He said… "Everything in the work should have yang energy! It is not impossible to write poems that are solemn and happy at the same time. I dislike poems that are sublime in any way but show everywhere suppression and heaviness."</p>
<p>Although these arguments are already very old, I still feel that they can be used as fair criticism for the current Chinese poems that are overly flaunting novelty and taking ordinariness as shameful. Let us listen to his words one more time to conclude: "The heart of a daring poet is full of moments of intoxication, wandering in a dreamlike and trance-like state, and he cannot help but break the rhythm of his melancholy feelings. However, it is critics like those described above who can teach you to enter the rhythm well again after breaking it."</p>

<h3>Regulations on the Prices of Subsidiary Currency in this City</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, in this city, on the one hand, rumors have been spreading, and speculators have been manipulating prices on a large scale; on the other hand, the Ministry of Finance has promulgated emergency laws and implemented a new currency policy, causing the prices of various goods to rise sharply one after another. Even subsidiary currencies in the monetary system, such as dimes and copper coins, have also risen sharply. Two weeks ago, the exchange rate for silver dollars was about 12 dimes and 400 cash per silver dollar, and copper coins even reached 3,420 cash. In the past two weeks, dimes have fluctuated between 12 dimes and 200 to 300 cash, and copper coins have hovered around 3,340 to 350 cash. Recently, however, there has been a sudden drop. Each silver dollar can be exchanged for a maximum of 12 dimes and a minimum of 10 dimes and 240 cash, and copper coins can be exchanged for a maximum of 3,000 cash and a minimum of 2,800 cash. As a result, the market has suddenly become chaotic. This has a very significant impact on citizens' purchases and sales.</p>
<p>The prices of subsidiary currency in this city are usually unstable. Even on the same day, the exchange rate for silver dollars varies from exchange shop to exchange shop. Whenever special events occur, it becomes even more unstable. As in the recent situation, the soaring prices of dimes and copper coins have their own reasons, but the manipulation of speculators also contributes to it. Even exchange shops take the opportunity to hoard goods and increase or decrease prices at will. This not only easily causes disputes in the exchange of silver dollars, but also greatly affects the lives of citizens. In recent months, the high exchange rate of silver dollars has caused general small business operators to complain constantly, because the sale of goods is generally calculated in small silver coins. Recently, however, the price of silver dollars has suddenly plummeted, with each silver dollar falling by as much as one dime. This is also sufficient to affect the lives of residents.</p>
<p>In response to this market panic, the silver and money industry must consider how to stabilize silver dollar prices. It is said that yesterday the money market issued a notice stating that, according to the instructions of the Minister of Finance, from the 4th of this month, the price of subsidiary currency will be restricted to 12 dimes per standard currency unit of one dollar, and all exchanges must be carried out at this price, with no increases or decreases. This approach is excellent. However, it is still worth paying attention to whether the exchange shops can implement this regulation consistently in the future. As for the subsidiary currency in this city, it would be our hope that it can gradually become stable due to this change.</p>
<h3>Neighbors</h3>
<p>— Jia Ren</p>
<p>The family of the bamboo basket maker, Old Woman Shi Lou: the quarrels and fights of four or five sons, the man's crude and violent nature, and Old Woman Shi Lou's own gossiping, shrewishness, all put together, simply become a swarm of bees that incessantly harass the neighbors from morning till night.</p>
<p>That big group of them, father, sons, mother, and daughters, all seem to be evil karmas from previous lives, now hitting each other, mutually demanding repayment of debts. When they meet, they never have good faces. The husband is a coarse laborer, full of savage strength. As soon as he opens his mouth, it's "Your mother this, your mother that, poke your ancestors," spitting out all kinds of filthy words. But Old Woman Shi Lou isn't weak, letting the man curse her as he likes, keeping her mouth shut and not daring to respond. When the man acts like an ox, she also puts on a tough attitude to argue back.</p>
<p>"Bastard seed, may you die a bad death, always insulting other people's ancestors, what kind of talk is that?"</p>
<p>"Whore's nest, dog's breeding, who told you to follow an old man, you worthless slut, unlucky, you still dare to say you come from a good background, heaven knows."</p>
<p>Old Woman Shi Lou is most afraid of people bringing up that matter, because her husband died just two years ago, and the man she's with now is from a secret affair, and also because of this, the neighbors all see her as a promiscuous whore, and no one can stand the sight of her. Yes, other people use this to ridicule her, despise her, and she can't do anything about it. But her husband should cover up this point, yet that scoundrel Shi Lou has no good intentions and is completely devoid of conscience, and instead grabs it as a handle, and whenever they quarrel, he brings it up in detail.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>He digs at her even harder, and insults her more. Old Woman Shi Lou still has to save face. Although the bad deeds of the past can't be hidden, she can't help but get angry when her husband deliberately touches her scars like that.</p>
<p>"Stinking bastard, if I'm a whore, then you're a turtle, you can say that too."</p>
<p>The veins on her forehead swelled up like earthworms, her voice rising higher and higher, yelling like a broken gong.</p>
<p>That man Shi Lou, is indeed a man with a heart of stone. When he sees the woman's appearance, he doesn't show a trace of pity or sympathy. Instead, his anger flares up even more. He glares with his eyes, smiling sinisterly; and while gathering strength, he rushes over, grabbing the woman's hair, just like a fierce tiger snatching a small rabbit, and then starts beating her with his feet and hands.</p>
<p>Old Woman Shi Lou falls to the ground, struggling and cursing, and crying and wailing.</p>
<p>The sounds of the beating spread out, and the neighbors ran in one by one to watch the show. The onlookers have no feelings, just find it interesting. It's that same old thing again, that same old thing has really been performed countless times.</p>
<p>Shi Lou is equally disgusted with the onlookers, and has no good feelings for them. When he sees more and more people, he roars:</p>
<p>"Damn it, get out, there's nothing to see here, you grandsons of tortoises."</p>
<p>The onlookers all glare at him and disperse bored.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the neighbors, Old Woman Shi Lou's fate after remarrying is considered deserved, because a woman who does not abide by marital fidelity will naturally have no good ending. The suffering Old Woman Shi Lou endures is precisely the justice of heaven, the punishment she deserves. Besides, that man was already a no-good person, he drinks, causes trouble, gambles, he has all the bad habits of idlers, and once he drinks alcohol, he goes home to vent his temper on the woman, which is enough for the woman to suffer.</p>
<p>Why did she have to follow such a rogue? It's all her own doing.</p>
<p>Early on, the man opened a shop specializing in selling bamboo baskets, and people called him Brother Shi Lou, and the woman was also Old Woman Shi Lou. Because Shi Lou was useless, muddling through life, and didn't want to do any work, the shop closed down a long time ago. Later, he worked as a day laborer for farmers. But doing day labor has a fixed time, it doesn't last all year round. Plus, his bad reputation is known far and wide, and gradually no one dares to hire him.</p>
<p>A family of six or seven people, of course it is even more difficult to support themselves, so fighting and arguing are almost daily occurrences in the ears of the villagers.</p>
<p>Besides the awkward couple, the four children around the age of ten were all brought by her from her previous failed marriage.</p>
<p>When there was nowhere to turn, Shi Lou turned his thoughts to the children.</p>
<p>"Sell those little devils, make a few dozen dollars and be done with it."</p>
<p>With the alcohol in his stomach, the man said firmly.</p>
<p>"Heavens, you should die, you've eaten everything, you even want to eat your sons."</p>
<p>"Who are my sons, turtles' breeding."</p>
<p>The woman has nothing to say, just lowers her head and sheds tears.</p>
<p>Driven by livelihood, there is no way to go, so selling the sons is the only option. Selling sons to survive, the villagers almost rioted, but they ignored everything outside, and then another one was sold, and Old Woman Shi Lou seemed like a prolific sow, having a son every year, having one and selling one, and now they are probably still raising and selling at the same time.</p>
<p>After Old Woman Shi Lou dies in the future, she will surely be thrown into the eighteenth level of hell, made to climb mountains of knives and enter oil cauldrons to be punished, the old people all say this.</p>
<h3>Musings on the Weather</h3>
<p>— Hu Si</p>
<p>Wind</p>
<p>Last night, a strong wind blew continuously, and the trees outside the house sounded like a heavy rain, and the doors and windows kept making soft sounds as they were blown. Looking out the window, the weather was strangely gloomy, and dark clouds filled the sky. There were no pedestrians on the road, and the streetlights were dim. A kind of unspoken sadness was immersed in my heart, the world seemed strangely unfeeling, and life seemed a little tiresome.</p>
<p>As for the wind, I never seemed to have felt a sense of loneliness. I have also drifted far across the sea. Although the ocean's strong winds are frightening, and I have been trapped in the boat, lying down for three days and three nights, it did not make me feel disgusted. Instead, when the wind and waves were slightly smaller, I struggled to get up and look at the sea view, and seeing the waves rolling with white flowers, and feeling the ship jumping in the waves, was even more beautiful, and it caused another kind of pleasure. On other flat sea voyages, seeing the sea as flat as a mirror, without a trace of wind, and no wrinkles in the sea, I would feel that it was completely meaningless, and my taste for and love of the sea would decrease because of this.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I encountered a great disaster of wind. Trees were uprooted and houses were knocked down, and many people and animals were lost at that time. The sea also roared, the sea water flooded the land, knocking down houses and sinking ships; that wind was so strong that it could blow a person away: from the land to the rivers, or from the roof to the ground. But I was fortunate enough to escape the disaster. I only remember that at that time, my family all lay on the floor under a solid wooden bed, and my mother held me tightly, as if when the house was blown down by the wind, we could also be saved by the strong bed board. That night, the sound of the wind was shrill, like ghosts howling, like a group of wild beasts roaring. The beams of the house kept cracking from time to time, and the thick wooden door of the old house was撞得阵阵地在响被风撞得阵阵地在响by the wind. My father and mother's faces were gray, as if a great disaster was about to befall them, and they made trembling conversations from time to time. But I was wrapped in a quilt, embraced by my mother, and didn't feel anything scary, and sometimes I would even sleep soundly for a while. When the wind stopped in the morning, I saw a blur in the suburbs. Some trees were broken, some houses were collapsed, and the whole thing was a blurry gray and white world. Although a sense of desolation would also arise in my childhood heart, I vaguely let the impression go.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I stayed at the house of a friend by the sea. That night, because old friends gathered, the friends talked very happily. Everyone drank a little wine, their faces flushed, and they talked about everything under the sun. When the night was quiet, I heard the roaring of the waves, and a strong wind swept from the sea. We even had the interest to pick up a flashlight and patrol the beach. Seeing the waves spraying directly onto the shore, almost wetting the bottom hem of our trousers, everyone laughed and jumped for joy seeing the sea all dark and a hazy night constantly showing Qing-white. The wind was so fond of us young people!</p>
<p>The breeze in the rubber tree forest in the South Seas is even more beloved by me. After the scorching heat of the long days, being able to rest in the forest, or take a walk after dinner, blowing the wind at dusk, and listening to the Malay love songs gently passing through the wind, is very pleasant. If it is by the sea, it is even better. The wind of the sea is fresh and sweet, it can intoxicate people, and it can also make people dream. The taste of this kind of sea breeze is really hard to taste in other places.</p>
<p>Therefore, in my past life, the components of love for the wind are more than the components of dislike. But once a person passes middle age, they feel that their mood has changed. Last night's strong wind, accompanied by my insomnia, made me sink into gloomy brooding all night, just like gloomy weather. Constantly listening to the roar of the wind, constantly listening to the sound of the leaves swaying, I also sighed, and a kind of inexplicable boredom and depression expanded with the sound of the wind, and my mood was like being blown by a strong wind into the vast sky, inexplicable. I used to not believe that the weather could change a person's mood, but now I believe it. But will I feel sad because the lively spirit of youth that has been ground away by life? Or will I rejoice that I have gained something from the experiences of life?</p>
<h3>Tiger</h3>
<p>— Ji Tuan</p>
<p>Life is like a fierce tiger, it constantly opens its big mouth, strikes a predatory pose, and watches me intently, ready in the moment of "one carelessness among a thousand cautions," to tear my chest with its brutal claws, and to suck all my blood with its rough, sandpaper-like tongue.</p>
<p>I don't know when, life lost its beauty for me and settled around me like a constantly lurking beast. Day and night, I felt like I was in a desolate mountain, facing that terrifying beast.</p>
<p>But, so be it, it's a beast! There's nothing to fear from a tiger; if I want to live, I have youth and courage, don't I? At that time (but I don't know when that was), I used to think that way. So, I began to smile at the tiger facing me—smiling so proudly! Like a confident hunter, overly confident that he could subdue this ferocious beast with his bare hands, making it a display and reward for his labor—"A newborn calf fears no tiger," as some people say, right?</p>
<p>I said, "I am standing in front of the tiger (if life is really a tiger). I want to see how it tears people apart piece by piece; I also want to see the inevitable final result: either I kill it, or it devours me. It is not my master, but must be my slave!"</p>
<p>So, I saw its cruel predatory actions: and I also saw this absolutely irreconcilable result! That result! I was afraid, I lost all courage to think.</p>
<p>Yes, what's there to think about, what's there to say? Morning and night, sitting blankly, reflected in the mirror is a withered appearance, thin, pale, and gloomy, like a low-lying area in a valley, where the smiling sun will never shine—contemplation, labor, running, endurance, for many years, I exhausted all my energy to deal with the tiger's claws, it gripped me tightly, tighter and tighter: and I myself felt more and more tired and exhausted, I gradually began to feel its power—constantly缠绕me, threatening me; so, day by day, letting its claws sink into my flesh, letting its rough tongue touch the numerous wounds: I will be torn apart and sucked dry—definitely!—Now the worst result has come: that is, the tiger of life has become my master! A supreme tyrant who likes to see people's struggles as the best dance, who likes to use other people's blood as a substitute for sweet red wine.</p>
<p>Aren't the roars enough to make people tremble under the claws of life? Life is not a small matter; it's a terrifying thing, as fierce as a tiger, as tightly缠绕as a python. Countless people are rushing about under it: people get tired, people's smiles disappear, people get old, people die—lying quietly under the ground, but with a cluster of indelible tiger claw marks on their bodies and in their hearts.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people still think their youth is something to be proud of? Yes, be proud—when you live among the teeth and claws of a tiger-like life day by day, you will cry.</p>
<p>Now, from a confident grasp of life, I have been left with a lifetime of beast claw marks. It's like being branded, forever indelible. I know that one day I will be torn to pieces and devoured by this tiger—and that day must not be far away, definitely not far away.</p>
<p>Once again, I trembled.</p>

<p>Modern Girl</p>
<p>Modern girls, afraid to get out of bed in the cold, with drowsy eyes, emerge from their boudoirs after noon, delicate and languid, waiting for their willow waists to be propped up, leaning on the sofa with tea, designing elaborate makeup, painting eyebrows and applying lipstick, with faces as white as frost. Imported goods, greasy with fragrant powder, sisters, enthusiastically promote them, willing to transport the blood of compatriots to foreign lands, look at the machine guns in their hands, all are gifts from modern girls. Alas! Sadness.</p>
<p>Modern girls, hating long days of painting in the heat, call friends and companions, busily making phone calls, electric fans humming, carefree and happy, enjoying cold drinks and chewing white ice, yawning lazily, exposing chests and arms, enjoying the evening breeze. Cicada-wing skirts, unrestrained forms, sisters, lighthearted and unrestrained, making appointments at the movie theater, intoxicated in the dance hall, forming the appearance of fallen willows and remnant flowers, all are the brewing of modern girls. Alas! Heartbreaking.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "National Flower"</p>
<p>Plum blossom, though not the king of flowers. Is noble and outstanding. From ancient times, poets have praised it. The reputation of flower leader is unparalleled. The chrysanthemum is the hermit among flowers. The lotus is called the gentleman, also suitable. Zhouzi loved the lotus, Tao loved the chrysanthemum. Their interests are very similar. I don't know that the plum is both hermit and gentleman. With a virtuous nature, high character, and dignified appearance. People in the world mostly praise peach and plum. Peach blossoms are charming, plum blossoms fragrant. The plum blossom. Only seeks stability. Unwilling to be fashionable, learning new makeup. With extraordinary elegance and no vulgarity. Ashamed to compete with peaches and plums for fragrance. Without a good matchmaker. Also without harm. The fairy of Miaogu is originally without a partner. Mountain friends are pine and bamboo. Half-night clear wind, moon, and different frost. Those common flowers can only listen to commands. Who can take the lead in embracing the spring light? Therefore, it is said. Newly sprouted eyebrows, stars shine. Old plum blossoms open their mouths, hundreds of flowers are busy. Who knows when the world is barren? Only to say that the human eye is blind. Unexpectedly. There is still the affectionate Lin Hejing. A confidant wants to talk about Meng Xiangyang. Now. The national flower is determined to be even more glorious.</p>

<h3>Aftersounds</h3>
<p>The Radio Wireless Station of the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Four Horse Road is broadcasting a special program from 8:00 AM to 2:00 AM on the 12th of this month, as the Jing'an Temple branch of the pharmacy is opening. The program includes Peking Opera from the Elegant Song Collection, Southern Opera by Shen Weinong, Records of Emperors of Past Dynasties by Yi Fangshuo, instrumental music by famous artists, Shanghai Opera by Xiaowenbin, Shi Chunxuan, Wang Xiaoxin, etc., Suzhou Opera "Zhaojun's Journey to the Frontier" by Wang Xiuyan, Shi Xiaoyun, Zhu Guoliang, etc., singing by the Bright Moon Society, storytelling and singing by female artists, a small song collection by female Suzhou Opera artists, and other programs such as Beng Opera and drum performances. The details will be announced after the time allocation is finalized.</p>
<p>The Rose Troupe has made a big move, with the return of Jiang Manli, the protagonist of the Hancode scandalous news, the lively and social butterfly Wang Manjie, and Wu Taili, who has a familiar but unfamiliar nickname "Pocket".</p>
<p>About seven or eight members of a certain society recognized Yang Zengshu, the music teacher of the Rose Troupe, as the author "Copper Thunder" of this magazine at the Oriental Radio Station. Xie×62 came "ferociously", but in the end, the misunderstanding was resolved by Xie and Yao, who acted as mediators, turning a big problem into a small one, and a small problem into nothing.</p>
<p>Yin Shuang Copper Thunder has an irreconcilable hatred with several singing groups, all saying he should be killed. I don't know if it's because of detailed and factual reporting.</p>
<p>Miss Wang Manjie said to me: "Mr. Yao, the news about me outside is all wrong. Please correct it for me." I don't know what she wants me to correct? (Above by Yao Ying)</p>
<p>(Editor's note: This Yao Ying is not Miss Yao Ying who looks like the old woman Zhang Xianlin, but Mr. Yao Ying, the "original" editor. Please recognize the trademark so as not to be mistaken).</p>
<p>According to a letter from "Jinshi": Jiang Manli joined the Rose Troupe because Zhou Gong repeatedly pleaded, and it was difficult to refuse due to friendship, so he had to help for a few days. The implication is that it will not be long before Jiang Manli's own Manli Song Club will be realized. (Editor)</p>
<p>Those who cut out the full version of the Peach Blossom Fan plot from this newspaper and mail it to "Buddha Voice Radio Station via Era Opera Broadcasting Society, 418 Hart Road" will receive a beautiful group photo. (Era)</p>

<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>It is said that the Electrics Bimonthly will be published separately, and Zhao Gongbang is said to be in charge.</p>
<p>"The Government Inspector" was advertised in the 7th issue of the Five-Day Newspaper, but in reality, it has stopped showing. The news has been seen in a certain newspaper. The reason for its suspension is that "Magistrate" Gu Eryi was too invested in the play (each performance lasted four hours, and he was in the play from beginning to end), resulting in a loss of voice and inability to perform again. Various rumors are mostly speculations.</p>
<p>Following "The Government Inspector," "Modern Wife" was seen, which was extremely stimulating.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Chen Dabe visited during the public performance of "The Government Inspector." If so, then Chen Gong should know the difference between civilized drama and spoken drama.</p>
<p>It is said that "Modern Wife" will only fill in the three-day gap, and from the 9th, "The Jade Horse" will be shown.</p>
<p>After "Little Aunt", the New Light may be changed from a domestic film theater to a foreign film theater. If so, then the only domestic film theater will be Jincheng.</p>
<p>Even if there is only one, the Jincheng authorities still have the pain of not being able to release good films. Speaking of which, isn't it miserable?</p>
<h3>"Les Misérables" Publicly Screened in Nanjing</h3>
<p>The greatest literary creation of the year by United Artists 20th Century Company, "Les Misérables," is now being publicly screened in Nanjing. Its original author is the great French writer, poet, playwright, and novelist Victor Hugo. This immortal treasure has been translated and spread all over the world. It describes sad life, cold cruelty, slaughter, etc., which is indeed heartbreaking. The two great artists who starred in the film, Frederic March and Charles Laughton, have shown their acting talents in blockbusters such as "Resurrection" and "Min Yuan." In short, a great work has its own undeniable greatness, and intelligent moviegoers will be able to appreciate this artistic crystallization and give it the value it deserves.</p>
