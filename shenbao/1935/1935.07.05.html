<p>— 恒</p>
<p>白德國希特勒運動成功而後法國對德卽驚皇萬狀縱橫捭闔欲以集團式之外造成對德之包圍陣勢故其政策利在成立立多邊恊定藉以約束德國唯德國方面則為突破此種包圍陣勢計利在訂立雙邊協定德與波所訂之十年不侵條約卽其濫觴斯特拉薩會議期間德國曾宣露此意閉會以西門與艾登訪德希特勒又以此為言卽五月十三日希氏在國會中之演辭亦注重此點德國對英頻送秋波而對意留一轉圜餘地皆可視為此一政策之表現今次英德海約之吿成可謂德波不侵條約以選此一政策之又一成功故德報於此約成後卽謂德國之孤立已成過去之名詞按諸事實洵非虛語二年以來法國對德之包國外交雖已著有成效然至英德海約一成此一包國陣綫殆難免幾許動搖矣</p>
<p>自來法國對德之外交常以能否拉攏英國為要着蓋英若站在法國方面則對德卽不虞有他唯英若兩無所袒或竟出而袒德則法必寢饋難安今次英國對於德國海軍要求之妥恊雖不能視為英國之袒德然其不欲歧視德國之意固已無可掩飾矣法國對於英國此種態度之突變雖極憤慨然事已至此法亦無可如何也此約成後論者卽謂法德直接談判之機或將從此開展近來此種空氣日漸濃厚政界耍人如法總理賴伐爾及參院外交委員會主席柏倫傑均有此項主張退伍軍人方面進行尤力依此而觀則法德談判或有成為事實之可能</p>
<p>自一九二五年洛迦諾條約成立而後法國對德實際上已不能訴諸武力今英之態度又復模稜如此則欲德之就　自不能純出以强力故法德直接談判不失為無辦法中之一辦法　此辦法白里安曾著效於往昔今再用之固有前例可援也</p>
<p>雖然法德談判能否成立殊未可必蓋法國日夕欲求實現者乃東歐中歐之多邊公約而德國之所反對者卽在此等多邊公約耳再則德國不欲與蘇俄締結任何恊定希特勒亦曾屢言之此點當興法國之意最相鑿枘故多邊雙邊問題之如何調和蘇俄問題之如何處置實為法德能否協調之關鍵就希特勒歷次之表示而觀與法妥恊似乎不成問題所可慮者彼始終不願捨棄東向發展之國策耳蓋和平何能分割德若東向發展卽有牽動西歐之虞此法國所以堅持訂立多邊之東歐公約也以勢言之今次法德談判之能否有成雖視雙方之誠意如何而定然德國若能埋頭於國內之建設不斤斤於國外之發展則雙方庶有接近之可能矣</p>

<p>（倫敦）內閣今晨開會討論阿比西尼亞問題、結果議决對於國聯會處理意阿爭端之威權、在原則上予以援助、一般人以為內閣此項决定、係因　登與墨索里尼談話失敗、及下議院反對以阿國土地割讓意國之故、此外最近英國國聯會協會、提出若干國際問題、舉行公民投票、結果贊成英國援助國聯會之政策者、佔極大多數、此事對於內閣態度、亦有重要影響、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據此間消息、英內閣决請法國合作、以約東意大利在阿比西尼亞之行動、蓋英國欲岡以國聯之力壓迫意國、必須獲法國之助、否則必無效果也、以此一般人預料英國將轉變其袒德之熊度、力謀與法接近、據可靠方面消息、英法密切談話不久卽將實現、（三日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）意大利政府最近拒絕英國不管部大臣艾登所提出和平解决意阿爭端之建議、並繼續在東菲洲作軍事準備、外交局勢因此突形嚴重、今晨內閣閣議對於此事極為注意、據消息靈通方面所稱、英國外交政策、必須視集體安全制度行之切實有效、方司確定以集體安全制為基礎、因此則阿比西尼亞事件、斷不能令其與滿洲事件獲同一結果、國聯會對於此次爭端、必須獲得勝利、然欲逹到此項目的、則必須令巴黎興倫敦、意見行動完全一致而後可、欲求法國與英國意見一致、其事頗為困難、英國方面亦未隱諱、但當竭力為之、因此政府或將再行在國會明白宣言、重行申明信守二月三日倫敦宣言書及斯德萊薩會議之公報、藉以獲取法國之諒解云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）今日下院開會時、自由黨議員狄基言及七月一日不管部閣員艾登所稱英國擬以領士讓與意國、以助成意阿間爭案之解决事、追述一八八四年與一八八六年之條約、據此約文、索瑪里倫之回教士王與人民在埃及撤回其對索保護權時、曾自動聲明願將其土地置於英女皇維多利亞治權之下、狄基根據此約詢問英國旣擬將此地讓與他國、曾否與該地長官及人民舉行談判、殖民大臣馬爾康麥唐納答稱、艾登向墨索里尼所提出之建議、係試騐性質、故此種談判並未舉行、若此建議續有進展、則自當商諸當地有關係者、以顧全各部落之利益、殖民大臣又謂英屬索瑪里倫之主要口岸、為白白拉而非才拉、英國允以才拉割讓阿國、而此地遂為人所注意云、保守黨懷愛斯請殖民大臣注意於一九一五年英國將索瑪里倫讓與意國時之憤懣人氣、艾登起而答復、詳述作此建議時之環境、並謂意相如對此建議表示滿意、英國自當立卽商諸法國、總之、讓予士地之說、苟未事先通知下院、决不見諸實行云、大約此事下星期四日在討論外交事件時當再透澈辯論之、（四日路透社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）消息靈通人士相信英國內閣斷不能坐視意國進攻阿比西尼亞、而不令國聯會出而干涉、英國與論在道義上亦不容許政府袖手旁觀、因此如意相墨索里尼謀進攻阿比四尼亞、則出席國聯會之英國代表勢必援引國聯會盟約第十六條、要求對意國施以經濟制裁、此說雖經官方加以否認、然一般人相信此種否認、完全係外交上之掩飾作用、惟英國倘要求國聯會採取經濟制裁、則無法國之贊助殊鮮成功之望、但最近不管部大臣艾登由意返法與法總理賴伐爾商談阿比西尼亞問題時、賴伐爾表示、英國向意國提議由意國建造鐵路通過阿此西尼亞領土、並以英屬索謀里蘭一部分領土讓與阿國、作為阿國通至紅海之走廊、此陣耳提議不應在事前不與法國外部磋商、且此種提議實有損法屬直布地城至阿國京城之鐵道利益、此外賴伐爾更表示法國决計保待法意聯合陣綫云、因此賴伐爾與艾登之談話陷於僵局、似此則法國與英政府能否採取一我行動、殊成疑問、消息靈通方面以為英國政府似尙將作最後努力、將阿比西尼亞問題列入集體安全制度之範圍、而請法國重行加以考慮、英國深知法國竭力主張集體安全制度、故擬向法國政府表示、如欲保持集體安全制度、則必使國聯會威權不受動搖而後可、國聯會倘不能解决意阿爭端、則英國一部分輿論將反對集體安全制度、而要求與德國訂結類似海軍協定之天空協定、而使政府無術解辯、此種說法、其理由亦未充分、蓋英國旣欲將阿比西尼亞問題置於集體安全制度之基礎上、則對於距離較近之中歐問題及奧國獨立保障、英國何以不願出而干涉乎、消息靈通方面最後則謂、縱使法國距絕在國聯會投票贊成經濟制裁、英國亦仍擬援引國聯會第十六條提出要求、藉以向英國與論表示英國維持國聯會原則之决心云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）自英國不管部閣員艾登前日在下議院發表宣言、說明渠在羅馬談話結果後、英意兩國為阿比西尼亞問題、雙方對立愈益加甚、意國各報繼續謂、英國所提之建議、僅足增長阿比西尼亞之氣燄、增高英國自身之地位、而意國地位則反為之减削、各報又根據英國少數報紙消息、斷定一只意阿開戰、英國確有在經濟方而抵制意大利之意、在此種情形下、今晨首相墨索里尼特召集海軍大將最高諮詢委員會、舉行非常會議之一舉、饒有意味可尋、一般人認為意阿爭端及國際時局均有關係、謂諮詢委員會所研究者、卽（一）英德海軍協定所產生之技術上局勢、（二）意阿一旦開戰、地中海海軍問題是也、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 吳大業</p>
<p>沿革</p>
<p>本局設立之動議、在前清光緒三十三年。初經財政處奏設、續由度支部議奏一切章則專為印行紙幣、以期統一圓法、挽回利權。故當時籌劃鋼版一科、種種設計、特較其他各部為詳備。同時并以重金延聘美國技師五人、專任　　及傳授此項技術。第事屬始創、範圍旣隘、淮行亦緩。至宣統　年六月、鋼版印刷品、始克自行鐫製、不假手於外人。民國肇建繼續前功、益加充實、遂得規模宏闊、綱舉目張。自是而後、設備愈臻完善、事業日趨發達、而鋼版技術、　馳聲於東亞焉。</p>
<p>溯自本局設立以至今歲、蓋已二十七年之久。中經國體之鼎革、政局之紛更、影響局務、實非淺鮮。允以局長之更替、幾於年易一人。以營業之機關，等升遷之傳舍。於是因循茍安，顧目前之利益者為多，而興時俱進，具遠大之眼光者蓋尠。此敘述沿革之餘，不免令人感慨者也。</p>
<p>（一）局廠之創建，前清光緒三十三年，度支部奉請設立專局，印製紙幣，以期統一圓幣，挽回利權，廷議準行，是為本局胚孕之始。以　屬新創，諸多茫眯。除一面覓定地址於白紙坊，先建園墻，及東西舊式平房數院，作籌備辦公之所外。面遴派專員，赴美調查，以資取法。故全局構築設計，係由美國米拉奔公司繪圖製案。土木工匠，係由日商華勝包修，機械配裝，係由美國老旗昌洋行承攬。一切設置，悉仿美京國立印局之成規。并增建東院之三座樓，以為職員居住及休息之所。於宣統　年夏，開始造。中間復奉詔，以郵傳部奏設之印刷局，歸併本局辦理。乃同時添築活版印刷完成三工廠，期年落成。大樓工程，則至民國三年，方得全部竣功，而東方唯一之印刷局，規模於以人定矣。</p>
<p>（二）局址之位置，在北平彰儀門內　紙坊，居平市極西南之角隅，本清工部火藥局　址，局墻后方及後方，均距外城城墻僅數十步。全局面積，共約一百　　萬方尺，合一百五十餘畝之廣。</p>
<p>（三）局名之遷改，初名度支部印刷局。國體更新後，度支部改為財政部，本局隨改名財政部印刷局，至上年國部南遷，又增　平，字，　財政部北平印刷局。</p>
<p>（四）局制之更動，本局長官，初定為簡職，民國改　任職。主理者先稱總辦，設坐辦，辦為之　。民國總辦改稱局長，裁撤坐辦會辦放諸名義。下設事務工務　所，各轄六科。民國改兩所曰總務工務兩科，改科曰課。民十九又改曰事業處工務處，所轄各課，復稱為科，至今仍之。</p>
<p>（五）技藝之進步，本局初設時，先　準印製大清銀行鈔票及郵票，印花，車票，公債，官照，文憑，契單，糧串，鹽茶引單，牙帖，各項官用證券，統　承印。當即頒訂郵局與印刷局交接辦法，釐定頒發行及防檢各章程，是為本局印刷之始基。比時關於雕刻鋼版，印製鈔票。以國內向無此種技術，乃在美國延聘雕刻及鋼版各專家五人，招募藝徒訓練雕刻大清鈔。</p>
<p>（七）局章之修訂　宣統　年，本局籌備略就，開始工作，當經奏定章則二十八條，以為辦事準繩。至民五，規模全備，事務益繁，於是加以增改，呈部備案，但未刊行專本。民十五年，濮任復加訂止，乃編印成冊。沿用至今，已越十載，時移　異，諸感不適。不能不參採最新之科學管理法，斟酌損益，詳密修正，以期與時俱進，而免落伍之譏。前已呈奉部令核準，</p>
<p>一年回顧</p>
<p>（甲）往年顧累實況，本局為國勞印刷機關，成立憶　七年，投資逾數百萬，日廠屋之建築，機器之設備，技術人才之訓練，種種經營，已具述於沿革章中，茲不再贅。惟局務因屢經政變，管理失宜，債累日積，景象不振。此去年四五日聞情　也。大業等適奉部令。來此承乏，彼時詳查本局已往新增之積虧，約可分為四項：（一）欠交之印品，（子）印花稅票共欠交二批，計六百萬張，已收價款約二十餘萬元。（丑）各種有價證券，已收定品金約二十餘萬元，并指未收之印價抵借十萬餘元。兩共七十餘萬元，并指未收之印價抵借十萬餘元。兩　七十餘萬元。（二）銀行借款，抵借各銀行之款必須即行歸還者，約　千餘萬元。（三）工薪積欠，欠發員司薪水工人工資共約七萬餘元。（四）貨款所虧不下一百餘萬元。斯時正當凋敝之餘，又有若許鉅額急債，環境之不景氣，實已達於極點。兼以政府南遷，一切印品已就近付印。各銀行之總行，紛紛遷往上海，華北生意較少。敝局每慮人多事少。不敷　支。以言整理，殊非易易。惟職員　在，努力整頓，懸鵠以待，一年之間，雖無顯著之邁進，然亦漸有端緒矣。</p>
<p>（乙）一年抽之整頓情形，（一）工廠整理，本局匠徒千數百人，分子複雜，過去時代，稽查員向來不敢認真督查，因之工作漫無統制。時因材料缺乏，局部停止工作，他部分趕制成品者，又須另外加工。各科機器半　半停，而　停者加，薪工損失甚鉅，實為以前賠累之主要原因，近為整理起見，將各部分鄧緊適當之支配。對於所有局工，擇相當者分作兩班，輪流工作，務使印機無時之空閒，各工有相當之休息。至於　用材料，并令先行備足，所有印品，已可如期完成，工資并可節省。一面并飭稽查科認真督查。一年以來，頗收效果。（二）增進工作速率，試以　　年六七八九等月，工廠中品，與已往各年互相比較平均計算，每月工作出品，約合十八萬元左右，較之往年增加三分之　，為本局近　年出品速率之最高紀錄。（三）廢票核減，　往年工廠所出廢票，約值百分之　五。近經飭工務處嚴密督查，　行獎懲，現已減至百分之十三，全年節省工料甚鉅。（四）核減燃料，查從前燃料，係全部採購開灤礦煤，因係零星購用，故每月所費甚鉅。茲者改向大同口泉寳恒公司，大批訂購。其他零星爐塊用煤，暫向開灤購用。寳恒礦煤，事前曾將煤樣飭由主管科詳細試驗，煤質甚佳，火力極旺。實用燃燒結果。較開灤礦煤，每月所需數量，約可減省十分之三，而價格則相等。全月較用閒灤煤，至少可省一千餘元。至於每日開爐架數，并飭由工務處視印品額數之多少，臨時分別規定，以節虛灤。其他取締收煤員司及燒煤工人各辦法，責成倉庫機器稽查各科科長負責隨時查報。（五）設立購料委員會，從前購料，均係由採辦者自己主持，考查難免不周。對於料質之優劣，旣不加選擇，而料價又復昂貴。近乃設立購料委員會由各處長科長共同組織之。凡購辦一切材料，均以公開投標方法，擇價格最低而品質優良者採用之。旣免受商人之準斷，復得痛掃以前之陋習。茲將已往所用材料價格及現在所用材料價格，略舉數項，列表比較於後，藉考今昔之進退升降焉。（表從略）（六）設立會計審查委員會，本局以前收支各款，從未經詳密審核，致各年度預算決算不能如　編造，嚴格實行。茲設立會計審查委員會，舉凡收支各款，曁預算決算等，均須交會審核，以期款無虛糜，簿據正確。（七）制定辦事細則，各科從前僅有暫行辦事章程，旣未切實遵行，且與實際狀況，又多不相符合，致辦事時往往發生窒疑。當即擬琮規則，俾各科辦事有所遵守，以利進行。（八）核減開支，查往年每十萬元出品，所需工資數目，為二萬九千三百元，所需材料價款，約六萬餘至七萬元。茲經力事節約，現在毎十萬元出品所需工資數目，為二萬二千六百餘元，實較前減省六千餘元，所需材料價款約五萬元，實較前減少一萬餘至下萬之多。（九）設立藝術研究會，本局印刷品，　於美術方面，未能得到社會十分歡迎。致各大銀行票券，均向外國訂印。此不特為印局鋼版雕刻之缺憾，抑亦我國最大漏卮。茲設立藝術研究會，對現代工作之新潮，歐美技術之優良，何者可以仿照，何者可以採取，互相觀摩，切實改進。務斯推陳除新，俾　營業之擴充，　拘利權之外溢。已有進步者為各　細紋　　及防止偽造之複色套印。近月所印之件，似有新穎貢獻矣。（十）彌補積虧，查　任欠交印花稅票　百萬張，合價款約三十四萬餘元。各種有價證券，已收　品金，約三十餘萬元。押借各銀行之款，必須即行歸還者，約　餘萬元。欠發員司之薪水工資，約七萬餘元。拖欠貨款約　餘萬元。統計一百餘萬元。茲者於一年之內，代前任歸還中央中國金城河北各銀行　款本息，并其他零星債款，約九萬餘元，補發積欠薪水工資計五萬餘元，補發各處印價計　　五萬餘元，其　彌補積虧約五十萬餘元。倘此後營業發達，國內銀行票券，槪由本局承印，則已往之負債，不難逐漸清償矣。</p>
<p>鋼版印刷與其他印刷之區別，印刷品製成之要件，全賴版面，儀器與油墨。每一　版面之印刷，專有其機器與油墨以應之。而每一版面之製造，又分為雕刻過版等種種手續。雕刻為原版之所由成，俱鋼版雕刻與普通雕刻不同，并日較難，其刻法大致分三種，（一）單由粗細橫綫分陰陽，（二）以粗細經緯綫分陰陽，（三）又加以點之餘元舒密分陰陽。請試以顯微鏡考驗各國之鈔票郵票，當可得其區別。惟僅以目力觀察，絕難洞見其奧妙。從前鋼版最著名之雕刻家，為一美國人名海趣，我局曾以每月　千五百美金之重資，聘為教授，在局五年之久，此人現時已作占。過版為拼刻原版上大小　紋鋼軸及大版，版面之開數所由成，工作更為重要，有專造之機器。如今世界各國所用之印刷品，以銀行鈔票及郵稅票等為最重要。但各國對於　　重要之印刷品，每因其習慣之不同，所用版面亦各有異。如美國多為鋼凹版銅凸版合併印刷。舊俄時代，羅布票上所印之五彩花紋，精美絕倫，舉世無匹，歐美各國與　國，均仿印之，而終不及其精美，以其所用之機器，至今未公開於世界也。於此可以證明，印刷上版面機器油墨三種并重，不可缺一。機器油墨今姑不論。先就其版面之種類，性質，用途，約略言之。按版面有凸版，平版凹版，三種。凸鳳者，其文字圖案等，皆凸出於鳳面之上，如普通鉛版木版等是也。平版者，其文字圖案隨版面而俱平。其製版時，另用一種藥水，使版面有迎拒油墨之作用，如今之石版橡皮版等是也。凹版則文字圖案，皆凹陷於版面之下，與凸版適相反。印刷時，由紙張吸取此下陷之油墨而成文，即今之鋼版是也。原夫凹版之所以用鋼者，以具質堅靱而綢密，銅則稍遜於鋼，故雕刻時，在銅版上所刻之文字圖案，決不能如鋼版之深且細。如刻檢細且密之紋綫，在鋼版上能分得極清，若在銅版，則決不能如鋼版上之分清，有時或竟兩綫變為一綫，以其質地，無鋼版之細密故也。寬窄如此。深淺亦然。且風景圖案等之雕刻，最要莫如光綫之顯晦，賴乎綫路之深淺，綫路之能分深淺，實由乎版質之稀密。鋼版則以其版質之細密，而能深刻，銅質則否。在印刷方面言，銅質堅於銅質。銅版版面，印刷　多，其所刻花紋，皀有糢糊莫辨之象，甚而版面磨光，花紋消失。鋼版版面，則以其質之堅強，不易發生此種現象。且版面之印刷，決非不塊所能敷用，故有上述原版　版等種種手續，鋼版以其質之堅能，將原版　軸，為圓形之滾筒式，再由所上之軸，將其過成大塊銅版或六開八開，各開花紋，同　無異。若銅版，版質極軟，在原版製成之後，決不能上軸，所賴者，惟照相或以蠟版電鍍，照相與蠟版所過之大版，　開數亦可分，俱其花紋必不能絲　不爽。再則鋼版在雕刻與過版時，用特製之軟鋼版，待版製成後，加以火煉，使其堅硬勝於常時。俱煉炎之機器與手術。又非數言所能盡。若銅版則絕不能製羅而複煉硬，獨鋼有此效能。　版煉　後，能勝印刷機之重壓，銅版則決難重壓。版面經壓，則花紋不易變動，不經壓則花紋易起變化。故我國與美國，對於國家最重要鈔票及郵稅票等，寗用鋼凹版印刷，而不願用銅凹版者，　其去要也。現在印刷　極　發達，一般對於銅版鋼版之分別，不甚明晰，故不　煩瑣，約略述之。</p>
<p>票，及指　印製郵票稅票各種鋼版。至民國三四年，學徒成　大著，漸能自出心裁。民五復添於藝徒　班，繼續學習。隨後僅留外國技師　蘭一人，以備砥礪苔詢而已。民十六年，格蘭亦解約而去。自是　後，本局鋼版工作，完全為國人自製，不復假手於外人。所有出品，　諸歐美所製毫無遜色。歷次參加蔥頭各國世界物產賽會，均得最優待獎狀獎章在案。</p>
<p>（六）機器之購備　本局設立之議旣定，首先派員赴美，購運全部機器。而建築大樓，同時即裝配完妥。以後雖有增置，　係小宗，或局部機件，并未續添重大建設。其可記者有宣統三年領得寳泉局船　塊九十　萬斤，藉以添鑄鉛字。民　添購切紙機，鉛印機，石印機，打孔機，石彩石印機。民四，又添購得第　圖書分局鉛印機件，并訂購美國鋅版印刷機，電印機，過版機，始應用鋅版機印刷。民十，添貝購電話交換機。民十一，技十沈永彬研究複色印刷成功，設置複色機，是為本局應用複色印刷之始。</p>

<p>— 胡天宇</p>
<p>對於飄泊，我是感到最深的疲倦了。</p>
<p>我現在需要休息。我想，只耍有三間房子和一個天井；房子一間做書室，一間做臥室，一間做會客室；天井里可以種幾樣心愛的花草，擺幾具精緻的盆景。每天，我從臥室到書室，又從書室到天井，朋友來，我可以陪他在會客室坐着，談着。在這和平精雅的環境中，我將成為一個幸福的人。我畢生的希望也就是這一點，而這一點幾時才能實現？噫嘻！</p>
<p>我疲倦了，是的，確實的疲倦了。然而疲倦有甚麼用呢？</p>
<p>在蔚藍的天空中，打若盤旋，找尋食糧的烏兒，整天的飛翔，使它感到不能支持的疲倦，但，在它沒有把肚子裝飽以前，它是沒有法子可以使它安適地棲止在樹林中的窩里的。</p>
<p>這暗示了我的疲倦只能忍耐，不能休息在我理想的安樂窩中。</p>
<p>我聽見姑娘的嬌喉在唱：「你忙了多年了，一直到今天……你太辛勞，你應該休息了！……MyDarling!不要動，一動也不要動一動，快休息五分鐘」！然而，我連五分鐘的休息也不能，雖然我已疲倦到了這樣！</p>

<p>中國的歌舞，雖然還不曾完全離開了幼稚的階段，但是，由見童歌劇，進而至成人歌舞，由童話的材料進而至現實的劇情，到底有了顯著的進步</p>
<p>前年，梅花團以「戀愛學堂」等歌舞劇出演於南洋羣島，營業總收入為三十餘萬盾（合華幣六十餘萬元）引起了南洋羣衆的歌舞熱，於是，國內各歌舞團都一致地向南洋開投，現在，已到逹南洋的計有梅花，薔薇，萬花，三班，正在途中的計有銀花，蝴蝶，梨花，三班，所以，國內的歌舞消息是沉寂了，現在，我把已在南洋各地表演的三大團體的近况，約略地報吿給關心歌舞者。</p>
<p>梅花：去年十一月出發，經星加坡，暹擺，馬萊半島，現在已在檳城演出，主要角兒張仙琳，蔡一鳴，徐粲鶯，范里香等，主要節目為「一塲春夢」「玩弄」二齣，號召力殊雄厚，到處受狂熱歡迎，在暹羅，一日之營業，售進五千餘盾，演員均發五倍薪，打破梅花團歷來賣座紀錄，其盛况當可想見。</p>
<p>薔薇：今年二月出發，經香港，九龍，安南堤岸，暹羅，現在星加坡獻藝，擁有曾經轟動南洋之潘氏姊妹花文霞文娟二人為台柱，號召力亦殊不弱，在安南堤岸一埠，賣座一月不衰，實潘氏姊妹之色藝有以致之，主要節目為：「一塲春夢」「轉變」等，潘文娟之「紅舞」「脚尖舞」亦紅極一時。</p>
<p>萬花：今年三月出發，經星加坡，馬萊，煞哈臘，現在安南西貢，女角人材頗齊，為張麗娟，李媚媚等十六人，但以無名角號召，營業較遜於梅花與薔薇。</p>

<p>待藥方一送到伊手內，伊就急急的逐一翻看；但見伊忽而皺皺眉，忽而搖搖頭，忽而微笑，忽而呻吟，像是對於這四張藥方都極懷疑的樣子。</p>

<p>— 轉陶</p>
<p>沿京滬路綫固然有不少名勝之區，江南的風景，可說被京滬路綫所佔盡；加着近年以來，地方當局的整理手腕，不遺餘力；譬如：靑陽港，崑山，雖然都是極小的範園，因為風景好的緣故，也成了中西人士休沐日游觀之地了。可是我們嚴格的說起來，京滬路許多名勝中，當然以蘇州同無錫，最為一般人所欣賞而贊美。</p>
<p>三吳淸嘉之地，在歷史上已經吿訴我們了。關於古來名人的遺跡，蘇州是很多的；山水和風景，都值得贊美，試觀前人的詩文，稱揚蘇州的，不知多少，蘇州可稱文物之邦，那是無可疑義了。而且蘇州的妙處，風景好還是第二，第一是幽靜，就是蘇州的居民，也像是與世無爭的樣子；一個人如能長住蘇州，淸福是最可羨慕的，無怪近年以來，許多退居林下的名宦，都要買宅吳下，可見蘇州之適合於居處，已是一般人所公認了。所以稱蘇州是住宅區，再確當也沒有。</p>
<p>蘇州固然是好地方方，但是我的意見：蘇州只宜於居家，講到風景，應讓無錫，這句話大家或者也可以相信；凡是到過蘇州的人，總可以知道，好的風景在那裏？就是生長在蘇州的本地人，恐怕也回答不出；虎邱山祇好算是土丘，天平山不過是虛有其名，此外什麼山什麼山，那一處是值得流連玩賞的！至於像寒山寺一般的古蹟，更是荒凉得可憐，只合騷人逸士的憑吊，談不到風景！無錫的風景，在京滬綫上，可稱獨一，那沿太湖的一帶，范頭渚，小箕山，梅園，螽園，那一處不是仙境一般的可愛；至於無錫人的整理風景區，精神也着實可使人佩服，蘇州那裏及得到他萬一！</p>
<p>所以我覺得：「蘇」「錫」雖然時常聯稱，地方情形，實在是不同的。游山玩水，是到無錫好；居家，當然推蘇州獨一；而且蘇州的「住」範圍也狹得很，他的好處，除了幽靜和恬適之外，別的也得不到什麼了。有人說：「蘇州的吃，是遠近聞名的，住在蘇州，口福總得享受了。」啊喲！這句話我可反對，蘇州的吃，那裏及得來無錫？不必說無錫，就是別處也及不上，因為無論是怎樣一處小地方，對於「吃」上，總有一兩樣特產，是別地方所及不上的，試問：蘇州那一件是有名的特產，所有的東西，壞雖說不上，好也不敢說，只不過是平常而已！若說蘇州的菜餚新鮮，又是及不來無錫，因為無錫的菜館，都把魚蝦養在河裏，蘇州那裏辦得到。很有許多上海朋友，到蘇州去玩，吃了東西回來，大不滿意的，這是鐵一般的事實。</p>
<p>我並不是鄙薄蘇州而贊美無錫，不過就我觀察之點，姑妄言之罷了。</p>

<p>天津南開大學體育主任章輯五、於民國二十二年、暑期出洋專攻體育、并考寄歐美各國體育施設狀況、在德國國立專已得有體育碩士學位、同時對於各國社會經濟政治及教育等、亦甚關心、原擬再作進一步之研究與考察、因其夫人染病甚重、乃於日前（二日）晚間乘日本皇后輪返國抵滬、下榻於新亞酒店、與滬上體育界同志有所酬應、并參觀新建之市體育場、即於三日夜間乘車北上、記者叩以此行印象、因時間忽促、承章君略述大槪、茲敘述如下、</p>
<p>出國經過</p>
<p>章君出國後、先至德國、入德國國立體育專門學校、專門研究體育行政及社會體育、而後復在歐洲各國考察、一年後又赴美國考察、總計在歐洲一年、在美國一年、返國途中、又至日本稍作勾留、以時間關係、未能作周密之視察、在德國體專得有體育碩士學位、在美曾參加體育博士學位考試、但論文未及交卷、因其夫人病訊、即待返國、歸國後繼續撰述、然後將稿卷寄美云、</p>
<p>德國體育</p>
<p>德國體育首重社會、學校其次、由法莤斯蒂統轄之下、組織十分周密、不論男女老幼、均須受體育訓練、尤以歐戰以後、德國受各國壓迫甚深、如限制軍備、不準有軍事訓練等等、希脫拉總統有鑒於斯、乃強迫實行體育訓練、其體育訓練之方法、除練習體操及各種運動外、關係軍事上之常識等等、亦均包括在內、故全國任何各界民眾、均能運動、皆有軍事常識、名為體育訓練、實為軍事訓練、而其收效、較之單獨之軍訓尤為廣大、且不致受各國之干涉、國家一旦有事、全國民眾均能捐軀衛國、</p>
<p>意大利等</p>
<p>意大利之體育完全重要於社會方面、莫索里尼對於體育訓練、尤為重視、工作時間之餘、人民均須往運動場、所有體育行政、均由政府主持、關於一九三六年之世界運動會之出席選手、莫索里尼已命積極訓練、為國爭光、芬蘭專重社會體育、所有出席世界運動會之選手、幾無一學生在內、丹麥瑞典等國、仍守舊法、着重於柔軟體操、美國之體育國內人士、均甚熟悉、社會與學校并重、選手制尤為重視、日本與美國之情形略同、但小學體育、特別注意、任何小學、對於體育之設施及行政、無不十分完美、俄國則專重社會體育、統由共黨主持之、提倡甚力、遍及全國、人民一有餘暇、則群往運動場上去活動、</p>
<p>所得感想</p>
<p>章君又談及國內優育、甚多感想、吾國體育專重學校、而忽視社會、人民視體育運動、仍若無關輕重這事、體育若專賴校來提倡、實為最消極之辦法、即如建築偉大之體育場、僅僅為開運動會而設、意義似不十分深切、外國體育場到處林立、然猶有人滿之患、是因體育已普及、有得不有多量之體育場引誘運動、其意非不可取、但究係一種畸形之現象、故在國內之情形、第一步工作、還須先從下層做起、然後再應設法將上層與下層工作、勾結起來、如是收效成可較速云云、</p>

<h3 id="c220">論瀟洒 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 姚雪垠</p>
<p>瀟洒，無論在中國人的生活上或藝術上，都是個好的形容詞。它的含義是閒散，淸雅和飄逸。究竟什麽時候它就被用作代表一種美的觀念，我們沒有完備的詞典，一時很難查出；大槪說來，它被人們熱烈的提倡，崇拜，是開始在魏晉時代。在當時，它足以反抗禮敎與權臣高壓而出現，和淸談有着同樣的意義。雖然淸談受老莊的影饗最大，瀟洒是由於五石散的服用，但淸談之祖也就是最先服用五石散的何晏，這就明白的吿訴我們二者的關係了。</p>
<p>據魯迅先生的研究，五石散幾乎等於淸末的鴉片，成了一種很普遍的嗜好。服了五石散以後，須吃冷食，喝熱酒，並以冷水澆身和出外散步。服五石散的人，因皮膚易於擦破，便不穿鞋而穿展；因身上發熱，便寬衣緩帶。至於服了五石散的人是否就淸瘦起來，魯迅先生雖沒有說明，但想來是不會不淸瘦的。人一淸瘦了，再寬衣緩帶起來，又不參加筋肉勞作，於是就自然瀟洒了。所以提到「瀟洒」一字，我們便不由的聯想到隱士，詩人，和魏晉人物來。魯迅先生說魏晉時服五石散的都不是窮人；其實不惟不是窮人，連商人也同樣不配。因爲過去的文化是封建地主的文化，大腹商人被認做惡濁俗物，講瀟洒的只是封建地主階級，尤其是由這階級出身的士大夫之流。</p>
<p>瀟洒不僅以反抗的姿態在歷史上出現，並且直接與封建的身分觀念相關聯，也和封建地主的物質生活密切的結合着。在封建時代，地主階級的生活是　散的，且以參加筋肉勞作爲有失身分，比如養長指甲，和男人的包脚，穿長衫，都是要表示他自己是有　的，有身分的人。生活規定習尙，習尙影響美的觀念，於是在那時，一切閒散的嗜好，如品茗，養鳥，賦詩，以及琴，棋，書，畫之類，都成爲高雅的了。在繪畫上，山水畫特別發達，又被人重視，便表現了人們對於瀟洒生活的嚮往。山水畫是地主階級對於閒散慾求的擴展，希望擺脫擾攘的塵寰，到山林里邊與淸風明月其處。他們又用自己的眼光來觀察事物，竹子就成爲瀟洒的代表，可憐的漁夫樵子也都是美的詩畫題材了。</p>
<p>在音樂方面，我們看見在歷史上淸唱與簫板之特別流行。中國音樂以纏綿和淸雅爲正宗，一方面是由於地主與士大夫生活之優美關係，一方面不能不是受愛瀟洒觀念的影響。唐朝人歌七言絕句，旗亭畫壁的故事，千古令人神往。至於提到宋朝人歌詩時，我們便馬上會想到月明之夜，詩人們携妓泛舟，和「小紅低唱我吹簫」的情景來。宋以後，散曲取代了詞的地位。但它也以緾綿淸雅爲主，多是文靜細曲，唱時沒有鑼鼓和科白，所以又叫做淸曲。最講究瀟洒的袁中郞在「虎丘記」上說：「比至夜深，簫板亦不復用。一夫登坊，四座屏息，音若細髮，嚮徹雲際。」這是多麼的淸雅！</p>
<p>瀟洒表現在文學上，是冲淡和性靈爾種風格相結合。本來二者原是互相關聯，很難單獨分開。在歷史上，這二者都有着反抗的意義。陶淵明和袁仲郞，都是當時文藝上的叛徒。在陶淵明時代，宮廷文人把文學領到一條死路上去，徒有華麗的軀殻而沒有靈魂。在袁中郎時代，摹古之風特盛，文人作文，也忘掉了還有個自我存在。因此陶淵明和袁仲郞都盡力的追求自然。自然有二：一是風物上的自然，一是人性上的自然。偏於風物上的自然，便多表現山水田園的愛好。偏於人性上的自然，便反對摹古與無謂的規律。二者結合起來，便是現實桎梏的解脫，便是瀟洒之極致。</p>
<p>但瀟洒雖是一個好的名詞，却不能忘掉它是封建時代的淤物，宅的擁護者是封建地主階級與由此階級出身的士大夫之流。現在適應它的社會條件已經崩潰，如果再來提倡，就不會得到多數人的同情了。</p>

<p>— 洛之</p>
<p>日本文壇的純粹小說論和實錄文學論</p>
<p>社會生活的變化，影響到文學上的變化，這是一種自然的公理。現在日本，由於社會生活的流轉的變化，所以在文壇上也起着無限的更替，初春的話題——行動主義，現在行將成爲人們的記憶中的東西，可是現在正如同夏天來繼續春天一樣，文擅上的舊話題，又有新的話題來替代了。這種新的話題我們可以舉出所謂「純粹小說論」和「實錄文學論」來，前者的首倡者是橫光利一，後者的首倡者是貴司山治。現在分述於下：</p>
<p>純粹小說論</p>
<p>「純粹小說論」本是帶有一種文學方法論的性質的東西，所以自從橫光利一在「改造」四月號上發表了那篇「純粹小說論」之後，曾惹起了很大的騷動，所有的作家，批評家，都從各種的角度上下着評論。例如森山啟在解明文學上的偶然性與必然性上，痛斥了橫光利一的關於偶然性與必然性的意見，如寺岡峰夫，站在文學的通俗性上，指摘了純粹小說論的非通俗性。所謂純粹小說論的要義按橫光利一自己說來，便是要使現在的通俗小說和純文學融和調和起來，在那裏構成陀斯妥也夫斯基或巴爾扎克風的那種巨大的浪漫的世界，要從那種從來的狹隘的固陋的日記吿白文學中脫出，進一步來創造十九世紀所遺留下來的那種像小說的小說，即是宗而有虛構的地方，而也要被文學的眞實貫徹着的，藝術創造較高的純粹小說。所以其中說到了「通俗性與純粹性」，「偶然性與必然性」，「長篇小說與短篇小說」的等等問題；同時還發案了「四人稱」的表現法的問題。這樣看來純粹小說論，好像是專在探求文學的技法了，其實按一般的理解看來，橫光利一的這種表現技法的探求，也是有着他所要表現的東西，使得他如此的即是也有着一定的內容的。那麽他所要表現的東西是什麽呢？這即是支配着人們的內面的「自意識」。所謂自意識便是人們對於現實的生活方法，意慾。這種東西在日本的現代文學上表現出來的很多，有的是與歷史的方向結合着，來鞭打自己，盡力使自己和客觀的現實一致起來，然而橫光利一的所謂自意識並不是這樣的，他的自意識是一種觀照的，是和客觀現實離開的向自己內部的探求。根本沒有一點主體的意義。請看他在他的長篇小說「紋章」中借山下久內這個人說的話。</p>
<p>「所謂自由者，便是使自己的感情和思想獨立而能冷然地觀望的一種闊達自在的精神。雁金君對於我是敵人，可是只有因爲是敵人，他的行勁才是强烈地敎給我所謂自由這種精神的……！」</p>
<p>這表現得很明白山下久內的這種闊達自在的精神——自意識，除去能以從對象獨立着冷然地觀照之外，是不能成爲鞭打自己，變革自己的一種强烈的自由精神的。</p>
<p>所以橫光利一爲了表現這種內部的自澈識，而發案了小說中的四人稱的問題，並且還因爲「這麼作起來……用短篇，作家是只有死的」（橫光氏語），所以希望着長篇小說。又因爲這種白意識的動法是非常偶然性的，所以希望着導進通俗文學中那稱偶然性來。如此便作成所謂純粹小說論了。</p>
<p>以上算是將純粹小説，它的發生，內容，給了一個槪括的說明，現在再移到第二個問題來。</p>
<p>實錄文學論</p>
<p>實錄文學的提倡，由來很久，自從去年十一月就醞釀，不過到了最近，貴司山治在文藝五月號中發表了一篇「實錄文學的主張」，才在文壇上成爲問題了。這一點問題，並沒有前一個問題那麽熱鬧，在目前參加這種討論只有德永直一個人。所謂實錄文學便是健康的通俗文學。請看貴司山治說：</p>
<p>「將被虛僞埋沒着的歷史掘出來，川現實的觀點，將其移動的方向和我們現代的有着一種連繫的。而將這描寫出來。這樣的有趣的通俗文學，是非寫成對於展開大衆的眼上有效力那樣不可的。……它是遵從着明顯地敎給歷史遺留下來的現實的意義的現實主義文學的一根並行綫。這是文學者驅使文學的機能的一部而想助力於通俗的文化的向上的親切的願望。……實錄文學仍然是一種創作。但它非作爲通俗文學而製作不可。如此，便不可荒唐無稽。它是一種將現實的意義從題材中拿出來的一種十分有趣的小說不可。……這决不能成爲現代最高的藝術文學。所以我從藝術文學的見地，將這種通俗文學，可以稱之爲啟蒙大衆的生活的文化讀物——即「般讀物」</p>
<p>這差不多是貴司山治的實錄文學論的全部了。即是用歷史的題村，用新的觀點，作成一秤新的通俗文學，——藝術性校低的文學。關於貴司提倡這種實錄文學的根據，他自己也表明道：</p>
<p>「譬如，你向一個人說：「你不是人！」這種攻擊可有什麽用呢？所以爲着克服這種「惡傾向」的大衆文學，除了創作健全的通俗文學之外沒有旁的道路。」</p>
<p>因爲在貴司山治的這種提倡裏，包含著文學通俗化的問題，所以德永直便起來反對他，說他是卑俗化的文學大衆化論。進而主張「實錄文學」並不能是藝術性較低的文學，而也非是藝術文學不可。這一種藝術文學只不過是歷史的題材罷了。</p>
<p>關於這個問題，現在沒有更多的人參加討論，所以至于究竟應該如何，只好等以後再說了。</p>

<p>— 德國托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>但此時我大槪走到一個凹地來了，因爲空氣　加寂靜了，我好久就在　密的山楂樹中間走着。有時，起了一點微風的時候，我就　得一陣農烈的香味，但不知從什么東西發出來的，因爲兩旁樹叢遮住了我的視線。右邊的界堤突然折向後面去，我的面前便呈獻出一個山丘形的小荒原。木莓和黑莓蔓生在地面上；中央，在一股黑色流泉旁邊，有一株細長的樹在在明亮的陽光裏面孤立着。無數的白色花球從滿樹眩人眼目的綠葉中突路出來。一羣野蜂在樹杪上像堅琴聲音一樣嗡嗡呌着。無論在城內花園或在遠處林中，我從未曾兌過這樣的緻景。我驚愕地觀看這株樹，牠在這幽靜地方站着，好像一件奇跡。</p>
<p>前面一段路遠，祇有一些稀少田地從我身邊隔開的地方，就是那個褐色的大荒原，向前展開去，直至眼睛看不見的的地方；地面最外的界綫在空氣中顫動着。看不見一個人，一隻獸，在眼光所能及的地方。——我躺在泉水旁邊草叢中，在這美麗的高樹遮蔭之下。一種甜蜜的神秘感覺侵襲了我；野雀在遠處溫柔地如夢境般唱着，頭上野蜂在花蕊間嗡嗡地呌；有時微風吹動，便有一陣花香襲我而來；除此以外一切都是寂靜的，直至極遠的地方。我看見蝴蝶在泉水旁邊飛舞；但我現在不注意這些了，我的捕蝶機懶懶地在我身旁躺着。—我想起不久以前看見的一幅畫圖。在一個廣闊無邊的背景裏，就像這裏一樣，一個年輕的牧人倚靠一根牧杖站着，像創世不久以後的人類那種模樣，一張粗糙的山羊皮常作圍裙，圍束他的下體；在他脚下，坐着一個美麗的小姑娘，他的眼睛垂下去看她；她幸福地無思無慮地把黑而大的眼睛觀看那朝日底下的幽靜景致。——畫圖底下寫着「獨在世間」幾個字。——我把眼睛閉起來；我幻想有個第二人從虛空中到我身旁來，同着她我甚麼需要都停止了，甚麼願望都滿足了。「娜麗！」我低低呌一聲，並把兩臂向溫和的空氣中伸出去。</p>
<p>此時太陽已經下山了，我的面前晚霞在荒原上發着光。樹上已經沒有聲昔，野蜂都飛去了。正是回家的時候。我的手抓着捕蝶機。但這個玩意兒現在對我有什麽用處呢？我跳了起來，把捕蝶機掛在樹上，高高地盡力所能及地掛在葉子稠密的樹枝上，然後，裁縫底美麗女兒底畫像在我的陶醉的眼睛前面晃動着，我便這樣慢慢地走回家去。</p>
<p>暮色已經深深垂下來了，當我踏出宮邸花園大門時候。門外，裝木馬盤地方，已經點了燈；手風琴聲，笑聲以及喧嘩的人聲，我都可以聽到，這中間還有一種假劍與鐵環相碰擊的聲音。我站着，從那圍繞廣塲的菩提樹中看過去，看這轉動的影子。木馬盤正在轉得起勁；坐位和木馬都有人佔了，老的少的男的女的擁擠了一大羣，在周圍觀看。現在愈轉愈慢了，我從綠葉枝間已可認出了幾一人影。</p>
<h3 id="c224">菜塲小景（續完） <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>回過頭，一個爪哇婦人的笑臉迎了上來：</p>
<p>「娘惹，我的烏拉散（註）是新鮮的，你看——」</p>
<p>「很對不住，今天我不吃——」</p>
<p>「噢……」</p>
<p>於是那爪哇婦重又坐在水門汀地板上，應付別的人的買賣了。</p>
<p>巴殺里人很多，用着各種不同的語言在爭論他們的價錢。一個由唐山初來的新客因爲話不投機跟那麻臉的馬來人衝突着，新客被那些最下賤的話咒咀着。我們的鄰舍大嫂逢到姑母就駐了足滔滔講述她的家常瑣事。一張馬來孩子的嘴凑在我的耳朵邊咕嚕着：「我們要到×××游水去，你要不要——」看見姑母反過臉來忙閃開去了。</p>
<p>有一個六十歲的新會人在巴殺的角落裏擺賣他的小菜。姑母說：「這新會叔公的兒子和媳婦在菜園裏耕種，每天淸早担了靑菜來給他賣。」並且她很稱道他的靑菜比人家的好。</p>
<p>「新會叔公，你老了啰，什麽時候回唐山去？」有的人和他交易，順便這麽跟他閑扯起來。</p>
<p>「你是說回唐山享福么？」摸着斑白的胡鬚，笑瞇瞇地說，「兒子還沒有發財呢。」</p>
<p>另一個人把一堆辣椒放在秤盤上，要他看看多少重。於是新會公公又把他的話移到交易上去了。</p>
<p>冰結淋還沒有做好，不然我可以要求姑母給我幾個銅子。看看再也沒有什麽可以買的了，「我們回家去吧！」她又走在前面，我提着盛滿了魚和肉，靑菜和蠶豆的笨重的籃子跟着回來。</p>
<p>而表妹已經在廚房裏候着了。</p>
<p>我又寂寞起來，拿起Ukalele到芒菓樹下去，唱着寂寞的歌。表妹的年輕的臉時常在窗子裏向我望；當我看見她的時候她却又吐出舌頭來了。我用最適意的微笑，回憶起有一次祖母的病狀達到極危險的夜間，她把我偷偷地呼喚到床前，用沙啞的聲音對我說；「小鬼！記好：我如果不幸今天夜裏就得死去，我沒有別的話說，只是將來姑母出主意要表妹嫁你，爲了我的緣故，千萬不要鬧蹩扭呵！」這樣，我要祝福祖母的康健……</p>
<p>「喝吓，喝吓，飯也不想吃了麽？小鬼，你眞是怎樣一個奇怪的傢伙哇！」</p>
<p>姑母的聲音推醒了我的夢幻。一骨碌爬起身，便回到屋裏吃飯去了。</p>

<h3 id="c225">研究小便處 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>昨日我至某處訪一朋友，回來走到某一廣闊的馬路，實在便急得很，於是竄進一條小里，因爲便急，也無暇考察牠的里名。一進該里，便見牆壁上用煤水寫着十個大字，文曰，「此處不准小便，如違送捕。」</p>
<p>但是奇怪得很，在此十個大字之下，對着十個大字站立在小便者，到有二三人之多，我到此無奈，也做了一次犯法的勾當，我起初有些疑心，恐怕我因便急，眼花撩亂，所以看差了或者此處寫的是「此處只准小便，不便送捕。」但是事畢之後，揩揩眼鏡，仔細再看，的確不差。</p>
<p>我想我們中國人，爲什麽專幹違法亂紀的勾當，明明寫着此處不准小便，爲什麽一般人偏要在這地方小便，我深爲不解，難道寫這十字的意義，就是請人在此小便，以廣招徠的意思，但是小便要人便得出，不比做生意，可以寫着歡迎參觀的招牌，請人小便，到底有甚麽意義，也是情理所必無。因此我對於這小便問題，下以深刻的研究。</p>
<p>第一，該處是否可以小便，假定果眞不可以小便，爲什麽在該處小便者，並不加以逮捕，送捕究辦。若該處可以小便，爲什麽偏要寫這發個大字嚇人。</p>
<p>第二，在小便者，爲什麽偏要在寫着「此處不准小便」的地方去小便，里弄中果然寫着「不准小便」的地方，確是很多，但是沒有寫着的，也並非沒有，爲什麽不到不寫着「不准小便」的地方去小便，偏要到寫着「不准小便」的地方去小便，這是很爲奇怪的一件事。</p>
<p>是否違怯亂紀，我國人的劣根性呢？還是此種禁令的不適當，也足以引起一般急於小便者違法亂紀的心理和習慣？故在該處小便者，固屬差誤。而在寫此十個大字者，也須鄭重出之，不可輕易亂寫呢。</p>
<h3 id="c226">古城的夏天 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 吉篆</p>
<p>雨像傾倒一般的不斷地落下來，打在一簇簇的茅屋上，聲音像有千萬匹野馬在奔騰。粗大的水點子從屋頂上與鬆鬆的土牆上滲漏到屋子裏面去，於是一種難受的潮氣便充塞了這些小小的古舊而蕭條的小屋。然而在這些屋裏沈睡着的那些被年月與勞作所剝蝕了的靈魂，却更放心，更安定地打起鼾來了：這夏天，到五月末還不曾好好地下過一塲雨呢，人整天在太陽裏受罪，也救不過田裏的一根半根兒秧苗來。這一天望見了濃密的烏雲，年老的連心花兒都喜得笑開了；夢不知有多深，夜不知有多長；夢裏是長起了一望無邊的肥大的油綠的稻桿，與隨着微風而起來麥浪，於是，樸實的，勞作下，希望的笑也在黑夜裏開起了。「一個好夏天，一個豊盛的夏天，一個平安而順利的夏天啊！」人依舊那麽想，那麽祈禱；不管這年頭是多麽凶險，這小小的城是多麼古舊與荒凉，這一輩子的命運是被安徘得多暗淡而可怕。</p>
<p>昏暗的中天的月亮被遮在幾重的灰雲裏面，用了灰白而懦弱的微光隱隱地</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>照着這破落的古城，照着田野裏的半枯萎的作物，照着古舊的水跡淋漓的幻夢，照着整個的古城的夏天。）</p>
<p>近來戚覺到：靈魂是幼小的，生命是脆弱的，那麼一個兒空蕩蕩地在人堆裏活下去，可眞有點可怕啊！爲了這，我打算把生活安排得簡單一點，輕便一點，便趕着這大熱天氣，悄悄地一個人也不給知曉，獨自溜進這跟着時代的病態的進展而顯得破落與荒凉的古城裏來住下了；在這兒，人底靈魂也許會伴着這地域的破落與寂寞，而漸漸地老了起來的。</p>
<p>這兒是有着五十來份人家的，可是大部份已經沒了壯年的男子了——他們在一連串的災荒的磨折之後，死的死了活着的已經不知浪向那方去了。剩下，就祗是一些給死所遺忘下的枯萎了的古老靈魂，他們，在一個自己所永遠不會明白的世界中生活着，讓灰白的平凡來相伴了他們，而他們則又去相伴着那些一個接着一個而來的死沈沈暗淡的日子。</p>
<p>然而，我是終於在這兒住下了；初來的當兒，塘裏剛有點斷續的蛙鳴，天是已經熱透了：早上天還沒亮透，灰白的天邊橫綴着一簇簇的赤金色的雲霞，跟着一股金色的光流緩緩地昇上來，一個好太陽已在當空掛起，地上便頓時熱起來了。這一陣已經好久沒雨水了，這些被侵蝕的靈魂是在困苦中生活慣了的，憂急對於他們已經是太平常了。祗是瞧着田裏頭的險象，整天地吊上水車上喘得暈了過去。到下了雨，則人們也許稍稍帶了點興頭去鬆鬆土。有的春上在田角裏種了的小水瓜，淋了一塲雨，不多幾時也就豐滿地長成了，自己是不肯吃的，祗是挑着擔子上鎭裏去賣；到晚來把一碟子鹹瓜放到塲上的竹筿上，大家把半　的豆米飯塞飽了（其實，已經是少見的了），瞧着天上的星星，嘆一口氣，無數的蚊子在四週嗡嗡地打圈子。那樣，一天的生命又滑過去了。</p>
<p>日子一天天地爬過去，我覺到，古城的夏天是和它的居民一樣地古舊，消沈，而破落的。</p>
<p>古城的夏天哪。</p>
<h3 id="c227">七星巖 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>是夏天了，靠着赤道綫的南方該是很炎熱的吧。</p>
<p>到了這個時節，我又想到了童年的時代的生活來，譬如我在南方，每到了這個時節裏，不是跑回靜穆的鄉村裏便是找一個蔭凉的山林裏去旅行。那蘊藏着可怕的炎烈的鬱悶的氣息的都市裏實在不會令我留戀的。——我愛慕着鄉村呵！</p>
<p>一個夏天，我有機會到肇慶的鼎源山去一趟，回來的時候又繞着肇慶城到有名的七星巖去流浪。</p>
<p>早上，未曾透出火焰來的太陽好像可愛的處女似的含羞地披着粉紅色的外套，輕沙似地飄　着的，張着溫柔而可愛的笑臉，好像慈母的撫愛似的駕臨着靜靜的鄉間小市鎭的郊野外，疏遠地排列着在山野間蒼老的村莊也披上了鮮紅的衣裳，叢林的梢間給風吹響了的哨聲跟小鳥兒們咬咬喳喳的歌聲充滿了愉快的氣息，綠葉也染上了可愛的色彩，好像所有的東西都變成年靑而帶着處女性似地。</p>
<p>我們離開了小市鎮，繞着狹小的路穿過田野。靜靜的河水很單調似的幽幽地淙流着，兩岸的蘆草給風吹盪得輕輕地搖晃着，我睜大的眼睛，感到鄉村裏的早晨是最難得的，新鮮的，上進的。那廣漠的田野上的露珠反映着早晨的太陽光，水晶似的透明。</p>
<p>我們向着黑色的山洞跑去，經過了許多山丘和渡過小的河中，碰見了許多有趣的鄉村小孩子，他們都是赤着腿兒的跳躍着，那麼天眞的，而且，他們會用驚奇的眼珠子瞪着我們，怪有味兒的笑着。</p>
<p>在路上，跑了不久，太陽已喪失了處女的美麗的臉孔，她已高高掛作半天空了。而且，大地上已漸漸地反映出炎烈的光芒，給人們感到夏天的酷暑，臉孔上很快地消下汗珠來了。</p>
<p>到了一座殘塌了的大廟宇，裏面儘是叢生的荒草，密密地，那也許是七星巖的山麓大廟，然而，經過許多風雨的摧殘，已顯露出冷靜的凄凉來，好像一個頹喪了的人在太息似的。我們帶着輕輕的步調跨了進去，看不到一點香火的影子，不禁地害怕了起來，所以，很快地拐了出來，又拐上了山峯，溜進了黑漆的山洞裏去了。</p>
<p>七星巖的神話很多的，但那不管牠，我們只要帶着探險家的心情地踏遍了黑漆的冷靜的水洞裏。也許因爲這兒是很淸凉的緣故，每到了炎烈的夏天，從都市裏來了無數的游侶，往往是不想離開的吧。</p>
<p>在一個灣曲的巨大乾洞裏，有神廟，有香火，那兒很熱鬧，但是完全做了我們的「摜砲」的地方，弄得洞裏好像戰塲一樣作響着。從這個洞裏出來，我們又溜進了一個像黑河似的水洞裏去。我們駕着輕小的艇兒。慢慢兒的掉進去的時候，已漸漸地感到全是一種秋凉的氣息，甚至是嚴寒的氣息。那一團黑漆的影子，實在敎人害怕的。當我們用燈電照着潤濕的壁上的時候，可以看到一點一點的斑紋，一絲一絲的水痕吊在半空。點滴的聲很淸楚而幽怨似的，那天然的藝術的畫圖好像劊子手似的凶狠，好像殘毒的鞭子，盡是死般沉靜的，令人感到無限的難過，當我們感到寒冷的時候，很快地把艇子跟着原來的路掉了出來。——沒有太陽的地獄裏實在不可以久溜的呵！</p>
<p>流浪過這樣的山洞，傍晚的太陽又照耀地送着我們回去了。</p>

<h3 id="c228">白蘭花 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 小紅</p>
<p>每天早上，正是從睡夢中醒過來在床上翻讀當天的報紙的時侯，寂寞的長巷中飄起了一陣銀鈴似的聲音：</p>
<p>「阿要白蘭花，珠子花……」</p>
<p>每天，每天，銀鈴似的賣花聲從遠而近的叫喊過來，再由近而遠的逐漸在空氣中消失，像難以捉摸的綺情的夢，從模糊中去追憶淸新的逝跡，再由淸新轉入到模糊裏去。</p>
<p>偶爾，因爲醒過來早的緣故，當翻完了報紙，還聽不到那銀鈴似的叫喊，心裏便會感到不安起來，「怎麼賣花的還沒來呢」？像預感着有什麼不幸，降到了有一串銀鈴似的嗓子的賣花女的身上似的。</p>
<p>一直到衖口飄起了那一串熟悉的聲音，我的心纔安定下來。</p>
<p>但是，我沒有向她買過一朶花，甚至賣花的是一個怎樣的面貌我也不知道。我祗是每天躺在床上欣賞着那一串銀鈴似的聲音。</p>
<p>直到這樣的事情發生了之後，我纔每天向她買一朵白蘭花，一直到現在。……</p>
<p>每天，是的，差不多是每天，祗要是有錢，我總在瘋狂的爵土樂裏去消磨難換的多情的晚上。除了跳舞，除了喝酒，多情的夜對我是難堪的。</p>
<p>在酒精的麻醉中，在爵士樂的麻醉中，我認識了一個女人，這個女人是有明亮的眼睛和深黑的睫毛的。</p>
<p>「怎麽你每天總是佩着白蘭花的呢？」</p>
<p>「我歡喜它。」</p>
<p>「還有別的原因嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有，就單祗是爲了歡喜它」。過了一會兒，又：「哦，也許爲了買不起香水。」</p>
<p>「你的意思是說，有了香水就想不佩它了。」</p>
<p>「不，有了香水我還是要佩的，我歡喜它。」</p>
<p>「那么，爲什麽又說爲了買不起香水呢？」</p>
<p>「不是同樣的有着濃郁的香味的嗎？」</p>
<p>我明白了她爲什麽每天佩白蘭花的原因了，也就在這天，她送了我一朶，那朶花因爲已經佩了一天，葉尖上已露出了焦黃的顏色。</p>
<p>但是我還是珍貴地把它帶了回來，掛在書桌一尊銅佛的頭上。</p>
<p>第二天，焦黃的顏色染遍了整月花瓣，第三天，第四天，第五天……它已焦黃得成了乾了。</p>
<p>但是我沒有把它丟掉，我還是讓它掛在銅佛的頭上。因爲這是對於一個舞女的最好的說明。</p>
<p>自從這樣的事情發生了之後，我每天買起白蘭花來，一直到現在。</p>
<p>現在，我對於那銀鈴似的賣花聲，不僅是欣賞了，我還每天化幾個子兒去領略一下濃郁的白蘭花的香味。</p>
<p>而在偶爾早醒過來的早上，在沒有聽到那串銀鈴似的賣花聲的時候，也就格外的會引起我的不安，悵惘。</p>
<h3 id="c229">暮 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 葉賓</p>
<p>從書架上選揀了一冊錦匣裝的小說，臥身到沙發裏，免强鎭平了心頭底煩悶，緩緩地啟了牙籤，抽出那冊彩色封面的書本來。</p>
<p>封面是一個少女的塑像，染上彩色，一幀高等攝影師手底的像片，她最近嗜好攝影，著名的照相館都留着她一幀或數幀的底片了，但是沒有一幀是她滿意的。她臥室的彩紙墻壁上，差落地懸看各種不同式樣的鏡框，是從畫報中剪裁下來的藝術攝影，或者好萊塢的電影明星，是她滿意的像片；却沒有她自己的。</p>
<p>她購回那冊錦匣的小說，因爲愛好封面上的彩色少女塑像，在書店中她就想隨手撕下來，但是伙計敏捷地包紮定當了。歸家已近黃昏，在乳白色的電燈光下，她再打開錦匣的牙籤，一種歇斯底里底衝動，她不忍由自己的手指摧殘那冊裝製美的的書本了，雖然她有意把那彩色少女的塑像，在墻壁上佔一個地位。</p>
<p>她謹愼地放置在書架上，眞是拂意的事。</p>
<p>她病了兩個星期，是醫生不能診察的病症。她母親疼愛這位獨生的千金，著名的醫生診治沒有效力的結果，她規勸女兒住醫院去。她更舉出不少例子，好像醫生沒有把握的病症醫院都能醫治的。女兒却更懂得醫道，她要求母親不要到房裏來多說多話，並且禁止他人來騷擾她需要安靜的心：她能自己醫治自家的病。</p>
<p>母親是不懂得女兒的「醫道」，她寢食俱廢地在女兒臥房門外竊聽，或者在鑰匙孔中偷望。女兒是安靜地睡着，房裏沒有聲屑，彷彿是不幸的事件襲來的預兆。但是門下了餓，女兒的脾氣母親却是懂得的。</p>
<p>女兒的病痊愈了，母親放下了心。</p>
<p>她下床的第一天，她想起封面上的彩色少女塑像，當她緩緩地抽出那冊書來的時候，她發見少女的面部上被蠹虫蛀蝕的傷痕。這使她大大的生氣，她對於愛好的像片第一次撕了個粉碎。</p>
<p>像春天的粉蝶似的，彩色的畫片在空中飛舞。</p>
<p>她站起身向窗前走去，揭開圖案形的長紗窗帘，窗外是梅雨天，細斜的雨絲飄着，和她的心一樣，那樣飄忽地。</p>
<p>父親的汽車，從車房中間出來，經過冬靑列的砌道向大門外駛去，她望見車後的玻璃上映着她爸和姨母的影子。</p>
<p>她想起了自己的婚事：</p>
<p>父親是滬上的體面商人，他所顧慮着的是經濟的操縱及自己事業上不正當的發展。家，妻，女兒，他彷彿是不需要似的，他每月在母親的床頭放了若干鈔票就盡了做主人，丈夫，父親的義務；女兒的婚姻，在他嫖妓宿娼娶姨太太的腦筋中再沒有空餘的地位來安放這件並不重要的責任了。母親是做女兒出身的，她託汽車夫，梳頭娘姨……替女兒選一位適合的丈夫。她鄭重地徵求意見於人與神之間，却沒有女兒自己的。在丈夫遺棄了她又沒有兒子，她選擇女婿的標準是具備了普通一切沒有兒子的母親底條件的。</p>
<p>但是條件沒有滿足她理想的時候，女兒的年齡是駭人的增加了。</p>
<p>她再不能支持自己震盪着的血壓，昏昏然地倒坐到梳妝台前沙發椅上，鏡中映着她靑春消逝了的灰黃的少女的面頰。</p>
<p>母親悄悄地推門進求了。</p>
<p>「梅，今天更好一些嗎？」像情人的喁語似的那樣溫柔，「燕窩湯煮好了」。</p>
<p>身體靠着臥室的門，等侯着女兒的答覆，或者女兒微微頷首，她立卽可以退身出去捧一碗新煮的燕窩進來。</p>
<p>女兒沒有做過母親，她不知道母親愛護子女的忠心，她沒有做到母親所希望的。</p>
<p>「媽，我不喜歡吃甜的，膩得要嘔！」女兒搖着頭，媽你吃罷」。</p>
<p>母親故意笑着。</p>
<p>「是的。黃梅雨沒有停的時侯，眞討厭！梅，明天請個醫生來瞧瞧吧」。她提出了這意見之後，恐怕女兒反對，馬上接口說：「娘也是腰痛背酸，大槪是什麼節氣，又要吃幾帖藥了」。</p>
<p>握着拳頭，反手到背後輕輕槌着腰部，退出房門去。</p>
<p>女兒向地上的彩色紙屑瞥了一眼，合上眼，想把一切痛苦的現象像母親一樣地驅逐到門外去。。</p>
<p>窗外雨絲漸密，又是一天的黃昏了</p>

<p>娜拉，並不是一個現階段的問題劇；但在請全世界的婦女們回到廚房，同到傀儡家庭的當兒，它還有着特殊的意義，尤其當業餘劇人在金城大戲院聯合公演後，對沉默着的中國婦女運動，又提起一道備忘錄。可是這劇本所給她們的印象，是出走後的娜拉到底怎樣，因此會使她們恐怖，顫慄，徬徨，畏怯。這在葛雷克登夫的「士敏土」中的　莎，在艱難困苦生活中長成，已有了正確的解答。至於電通司徒慧敏編導的「自由神」，對於這一點更積極地正確地指示了出走後的娜拉，不是在歧路徘徊，训練自己，是做一個獨立的堂堂的人，是爲社會去服務。</p>

At 10:00 AM on the 4th, it also hosted the Soviet Russian ambassador to China, Bogomolov, at the West Garden Hall of the Academy for the second conversation. As many as thirty-three people, including Sun Ke, Chuan Bingchang, Jiao Yitang, Wu Shangying, and He Sui, were present. Bao arrived as scheduled with his secretary, Oshanin Ratzeff, and brought a lot of reference materials. Sun was slightly delayed in attending the meeting because he was attending the Central Standing Committee. After Chairman Fu made a brief introduction, Bao stood up and spoke in English, first expressing his humility and gratitude, and then described the Soviet Union's second five-year plan, education, culture, democracy, international trade, and diplomatic policy in detail. Xia Jinlin, a member of the Legislative Yuan, served as the translator. After more than an hour, he concluded his remarks and then answered questions from the members of the Legislative Yuan in detail. They discussed Sino-Soviet issues in detail and were extremely interested. It was not until 12:00 PM that they dispersed. After the meeting, Chuan led Bao and others to the president's office to meet Sun Ke and exchange greetings, and then took a car to Lingtuan Xincun to attend Sun's banquet. They enjoyed themselves until they dispersed. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e22">The Brewing of Franco-German Negotiations <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>After the success of Hitler's movement in Germany, France was shocked and tried to create an encirclement against Germany by forming a group-style alliance. Therefore, its policy was to establish multilateral agreements to restrain Germany. However, Germany's plan was to break through this encirclement by entering into bilateral agreements. The ten-year non-aggression treaty signed between Germany and Poland was the beginning of this. During the Stresa Conference, Germany expressed this intention. After the close of the conference, when Simon and Eden visited Germany, Hitler also mentioned this point, and Hitler's speech in the National Assembly on May 13 also focused on this point. Germany's frequent overtures to England and its allowance of a turning point for Italy can all be seen as manifestations of this policy. The completion of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement can be said to be another success of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty in choosing this policy. Therefore, German newspapers said that Germany's isolation has become a thing of the past after this agreement was reached. This is by no means an exaggeration of the facts. Although France's encirclement diplomacy against Germany for two years has been effective, it is difficult to avoid some shaking of this encirclement after the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is reached.</p>
<p>France's diplomacy towards Germany has always relied on whether it can win over England, because if England stands on France's side, there will be no fear of Germany. However, if England does not take sides or even protects Germany, France will have trouble sleeping and eating. Although England's compromise on Germany's naval demands this time cannot be regarded as England's protection of Germany, its intention not to discriminate against Germany cannot be concealed. Although France is extremely angry at this sudden change in England's attitude, there is nothing France can do about it. After this agreement was reached, it was said that the opportunity for direct Franco-German negotiations may open up from this. Recently, this kind of atmosphere has become increasingly strong, and political figures such as French Prime Minister Laval and Chairman Belinjer of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee have also advocated this. The veterans are making even more efforts. Based on this, Franco-German negotiations may become a reality.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Locarno Treaty in 1925, France has been unable to resort to force against Germany in practice. Now that England's attitude is so ambiguous, it is impossible to force Germany to submit by force alone. Therefore, direct Franco-German negotiations are one of the only options. Briand had achieved success in the past with this method, and now it can be used again with precedents to follow.</p>
<p>However, it is still uncertain whether Franco-German negotiations can be established. What France wants to achieve day and night is the multilateral convention of Eastern Europe and Central Europe, and what Germany opposes is these multilateral conventions. Furthermore, Germany does not want to conclude any agreement with Soviet Russia, and Hitler has repeatedly said this. This point is most incompatible with France's intentions. Therefore, how to reconcile the multilateral and bilateral issues and how to deal with the Soviet Russian issue are the keys to whether France and Germany can coordinate. Judging from Hitler's previous expressions, it seems that there is no problem in compromising with France. What is worrisome is that he is always unwilling to abandon the national policy of developing eastward. Peace cannot be divided. If Germany develops eastward, there is a risk of affecting Western Europe. This is why France insists on concluding a multilateral Eastern European convention. In terms of the situation, whether the Franco-German negotiations can succeed this time depends on the sincerity of both parties, but if Germany can focus on domestic construction and not focus on foreign development, the two parties may be able to approach each other.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Resolving the Italy-Abyssinia Dispute: Britain Leans on the League of Nations to Assert Itself; Will Request Economic Sanctions If Necessary; Strives to Get Closer to France for Support <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet met this morning to discuss the Abyssinian problem. The result was a resolution to, in principle, assist the League of Nations in handling the authority of the Italy-Abyssinia dispute. It is generally believed that the Cabinet's decision was due to Eden's failed talks with Mussolini and the House of Commons' opposition to ceding Abyssinian land to Italy. In addition, the recent plebiscite held by the British League of Nations Association on several international issues showed that the vast majority supported Britain's policy of assisting the League of Nations. This also had a significant impact on the Cabinet's attitude. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to sources here, the British Cabinet has decided to seek cooperation from France to restrain Italy's actions in Abyssinia. Britain believes that to compel Italy with the power of the League of Nations, it must obtain France's assistance; otherwise, it will be ineffective. Therefore, it is generally expected that Britain will change its pro-German attitude and strive to get closer to France. According to reliable sources, close talks between Britain and France will soon be realized. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to United News, the British government is seeking to cooperate with France to implement the London Declaration of February and March and to deal with the Italy-Abyssinia conflict. It is constantly consulting with the French government on solutions. It is said that the British Ambassador to France, Sir George Clerk, visits French Prime Minister Laval daily for this purpose. However, apart from France, Britain is temporarily unwilling to consult with other League of Nations member states. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian government recently rejected the proposal by British Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden for a peaceful resolution to the Italy-Abyssinia dispute and continues to make military preparations in East Africa. As a result, the diplomatic situation has suddenly become serious. The Cabinet paid close attention to this matter at its meeting this morning. According to well-informed sources, British foreign policy must be determined on the basis of the effective implementation of the collective security system. Therefore, the Abyssinia incident must not be allowed to end in the same way as the Manchurian Incident. The League of Nations must achieve victory in this dispute. However, to achieve this goal, Paris and London must have complete agreement in opinions and actions. Seeking consensus between France and Britain is quite difficult, and the British side has not concealed this, but will do its best. Therefore, the government may once again make a clear declaration in Parliament, reaffirming its commitment to the London Declaration of February and March and the communique of the Stresa Conference, in order to obtain France's understanding.

<p>Abyssinian Minister of War Declares: Addis Ababa. The Abyssinian Minister of War stated that the recent report in the Paris Morning Post that the Abyssinian army has a total of 140,000 men is far from the truth. The army actually has 350,000 men. If forced to mobilize, 900,000 men can be conscripted within two to four weeks. Some have modern weapons, while others have old-fashioned guns, but all are familiar with modern tactics.

<p>Arbitration Committee: The Hague. After continuing its meeting today, the committee investigating the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia decided to listen to the opinions of the Italian and Abyssinian representatives tomorrow. In the debate between the representatives of the two countries, Italian representative Professor Giszti will use the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Clifford, a British army officer who was near Walwal on December 5 when the conflict occurred. He will also present an Italian map to prove that Walwal is located far from the border between Italian Somaliland and Abyssinia. At the same time, the Italian delegation has increased to fifteen people, all of whom are heavily guarded by Dutch police. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>(London) During today's House of Commons session, Liberal MP Mr. Dingle Foot referred to the statement made by Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden on July 1 that Britain intended to cede territory to Italy to help resolve the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. He recounted the treaties of 1884 and 1886, according to which, when Egypt withdrew its protection over Somaliland, the Muslim king and people of Somaliland voluntarily declared their willingness to place their land under the rule of Queen Victoria. Based on this treaty, Mr. Dingle Foot asked whether Britain had held negotiations with the local leaders and people before intending to cede this land to another country. Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald replied that Eden's proposal to Mussolini was exploratory in nature, so no such negotiations had taken place. If this proposal continues to progress, the relevant parties in the area will naturally be consulted to safeguard the interests of all tribes. The Colonial Secretary also said that the main port of British Somaliland is Berbera, not Zeila. Britain agreed to cede Zeila to Abyssinia, and this is why this area has attracted attention. Conservative MP Sir Henry Page Croft asked the Colonial Secretary to note the popular resentment when Britain ceded Somaliland to Italy in 1915. Eden rose to respond, detailing the circumstances under which the proposal was made, and said that if Mussolini expressed satisfaction with this proposal, Britain would immediately consult with France. In short, the cession of territory will not be implemented without prior notification to the House of Commons. It is expected that this matter will be thoroughly debated again next Thursday during the discussion of foreign affairs. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e25">Britain Will Not Stand Idly By Regarding Italy's Actions <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources believe that the British Cabinet cannot stand by and watch Italy attack Abyssinia without the League of Nations intervening. British public opinion also does not allow the government to stand idly by on moral grounds. Therefore, if Mussolini plans to attack Abyssinia, the British representative attending the League of Nations will inevitably invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant and demand economic sanctions against Italy. Although this has been officially denied, it is generally believed that this denial is purely a diplomatic cover. However, if Britain requests the League of Nations to adopt economic sanctions, it will be difficult to succeed without the support of France. But recently, when Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden returned from Italy to France to discuss the Abyssinia problem with French Prime Minister Laval, Laval indicated that the British proposal to Italy to build a railway through Abyssinian territory and to cede part of British Somaliland to Abyssinia as a corridor for Abyssinia to reach the Red Sea should not have been made without prior consultation with the French foreign ministry, and that this proposal would actually damage the interests of the railway from Djibouti City in French Somaliland to the Abyssinian capital. In addition, Laval further stated that France is determined to maintain the Franco-Italian alliance. Therefore, the talks between Laval and Eden reached a stalemate. It is questionable whether France and the British government can take the same action. Well-informed sources believe that the British government seems to be making a final effort to include the Abyssinia problem within the scope of the collective security system and to ask France to reconsider it. Britain is well aware that France strongly advocates the collective security system, so it intends to express to the French government that if it wants to maintain the collective security system, it must ensure that the authority of the League of Nations is not shaken. If the League of Nations cannot resolve the Italy-Abyssinia dispute, part of British public opinion will oppose the collective security system and demand that an air pact similar to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement be concluded with Germany, leaving the government unable to explain. The rationale for this argument is not entirely adequate, as Britain is placing the Abyssinia problem on the basis of the collective security system, so why is Britain unwilling to intervene in the closer Central European problems and the guarantee of Austrian independence? Well-informed sources finally said that even if France refuses to vote in favor of economic sanctions in the League of Nations, Britain still intends to invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to express to British public opinion Britain's determination to uphold the principles of the League of Nations.

<h3 id="e26">Mussolini Convening: Supreme Naval Conference; Studies the Situation Created by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement; The Antagonistic Relationship Between Britain and Italy Becomes More Apparent <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Supreme Naval Military Conference, convened by Prime Minister Mussolini, opened today. Chaired by Mussolini, it discussed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the situation created by Eden's visit to Rome and his statement to the British House of Commons. The conference is scheduled to last two days. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Abyssinian Embassy here denied that there were any further conflicts on the Italian-Abyssinian border and expressed surprise at Eden's proposed solution to the Italian-Abyssinian problem, as it had not been consulted with Abyssinia beforehand. It is also heard that Mussolini is currently discussing with the Naval Committee how to maintain contact between the East African territories and the mainland, and that the Anglo-German Naval Agreement has also been studied. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Since British Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden made a declaration in the House of Commons the day before yesterday, explaining the results of his talks in Rome, the opposition between Britain and Italy over the Abyssinia issue has intensified. Italian newspapers continue to say that Britain's proposal only serves to increase Abyssinia's arrogance and elevate Britain's own position, while Italy's position is diminished. The newspapers also, based on reports in a few British newspapers, determine that once Italy and Abyssinia go to war, Britain will indeed intend to economically resist Italy. Under these circumstances, Prime Minister Mussolini's convening of the Supreme Advisory Committee of Naval Admirals for an extraordinary meeting this morning is highly significant. It is generally believed that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute is related to the international situation, and that the Advisory Committee is studying (1) the technical situation created by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and (2) the naval problems in the Mediterranean once Italy and Abyssinia go to war.

<p>Milan. Italian newspapers are becoming increasingly resentful of the British newspapers' talk of economic sanctions regarding the Italian-Abyssinian issue. The Rome People's Newspaper said that London's talk of economic sanctions does not know the meaning of economic sanctions, which is war. Another newspaper claimed that if British public opinion advocates that the British government interfere in Italy's legitimate actions in East Africa, it is enough to worry about the future of relations between the two countries. Fortunately, the British government's policy is not entirely in line with the British newspapers' advocacy, so the friendship between the two countries can still be maintained. The British should know that no matter whether Britain adopts the means of blockading the Suez Canal or economic sanctions, it will ultimately not be able to prevent Italy from maintaining the dignity of its national flag, even if Britain leans on the League of Nations to assert itself.

<p>(Paris) The British Cabinet's proposal that Britain, France, and Germany should exchange naval programs is not generally approved by French political circles. The most opposed are the countries that have not yet approved the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, which is of a bilateral nature between Britain and Germany. If France now approves the British Cabinet's proposal, it seems to have already approved the agreement. However, France believes that the British government should follow the agreements of London and Stresa and notify the French government of any information regarding Germany's intentions. As for France's future naval program, it must be determined after the German naval program is known. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers are competing to publish the remarks made by British First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Bolton Eyres Monsell in the House of Commons yesterday when discussing the abolition of submarines. At that time, Monsell said that in his declaration on May 21, Hitler guaranteed that if other countries were willing to abandon submarines, Germany would also be willing to do so. The British government fully agreed with this. The German representative who participated in the London talks also confirmed this statement. Unfortunately, other countries were unwilling to adopt this method. Several MPs then immediately asked the First Lord of the Admiralty to point out the countries that were hindering the Anglo-German proposal to abolish submarines. The First Lord of the Admiralty then replied that several major countries, such as France and Japan, did not approve of this proposal. (National News Agency, 4th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee, Pierre-Étienne Flandin, commented on Franco-German relations in the Radical Socialist Party organ, La République, saying that the current situation is actually better than before. France no longer opposes direct negotiations with Germany and said that France should have started negotiations with Germany at the beginning of the establishment of the Hitler government, and that it was a mistake to vainly hope for the collapse of the National Socialist movement. Flandin said that France has already missed a good opportunity. If it starts direct negotiations with Germany now, it will only follow Britain and Poland and lose the initiative. The facts of the past few weeks clearly show that any policy of encircling Germany will inevitably cause disputes. It is unwise to want Germany to join the European Convention without its consent. Germany will never compromise in this situation. Germany's position is increasing day by day, and its influence in the Balkans is also expanding day by day. France still holds the reins in the Balkans. Are we going to wait until France's influence is completely eliminated before we negotiate? Germany now needs France's cooperation, but this opportunity may not last long. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>

Le Journal believed that the Polish government's strategy is to strive to maintain a balance between Russia and Germany. As this strategy becomes more difficult to implement, Poland will increasingly need to seek strong support from France.

<p>Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia.

The government will cooperate with other countries to consolidate the peace organization, and it will continue to maintain all attempts to limit armaments. However, the government will still pay close attention to the country's military strength. In terms of domestic affairs, the government will formulate laws in accordance with the wishes of the people so that the majority of the people can participate in political power. In terms of economic and financial matters, the government will pay attention to budget balance and protect the country's currency.

<p>(Vienna) The State Council passed a bill this afternoon to abolish the law on the confiscation of the private property of the royal family when the republican government was established. When the bill was passed, members of the State Council unanimously cheered to express their welcome. In order to dispel the fears of those who oppose the restoration of Austria, the authorities made it clear that the law only applies to property rights and has no political impact, so it has nothing to do with the restoration of the Habsburg royal family. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The Cabinet decided to repeal the law that was made at the end of the war to abolish the Habsburg dynasty. This decision brings the restoration a step closer. A draft proposal has now been drawn up so that the Cabinet's plan can be implemented. It is expected that the First Chamber will pass it, as this is only a formality. The date is July 9. The political world is skeptical of the government's claim that it does not want to set far-reaching plans, and they all believe that if there are no unexpected events, the restoration will be implemented within this year. At the same time, State Councilor Karl Karwinsky and Baron Weiszner will go to Steenokkerzeel in Belgium, where Archduke Otto currently resides, to discuss the return of the royal property that was previously confiscated. It is heard that the restoration will also be involved. According to Austrian newspapers, the government plans to abolish the Habsburg dynasty's loss of rights law in the near future and return property worth millions of pounds to the former royal family. If so, the famous Vienna Museum and twelve palaces and several villas that were confiscated by the Austrian government in 1918 will all be returned to the Habsburg royal family. It is believed that the first step of this action by the Austrian government will be to allow Archduke Otto to return to Austria as a private citizen, and then a major publicity campaign will be launched to highlight the benefits of the restoration to the country. All powerful circles regard this move as the best way to curb the National Socialist movement. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Édouard Herriot's conflict with the members of the Radical Socialist Party has ended in victory. At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Radical Socialist Party yesterday, the followers of both Herriot and Daladier debated fiercely. At 11:30 a.m., the committee, under Herriot's eloquent arguments, passed his method of taking into account the national interests and not making demonstrations that would benefit the right wing. Herriot's plan was first reviewed by the party's core members before it was published, so it was accepted by the entire audience when it was put to a vote. At that time, a member stood up to protest cooperation with the Communist Party, but was suppressed by the crowd. It can be seen from this that the Radical Socialist Party is now completely controlled by the left wing. The Radical Socialist Party is now scheduled to hold a party congress in August, so before August, Herriot's leadership position will not be a problem. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The "Croix-de-Feu" (Cross of Fire), an organization of veterans with extreme nationalist tendencies in France, announced that it had abandoned its plan to hold a demonstration in front of the Arc de Triomphe on the 7th of this month, but plans to take action on the 14th of this month to commemorate the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. This temporary change was provoked by the government's refusal to allow the demonstration to be held on the 7th of this month and the permission to allow only left-wing parties to hold demonstrations on the 14th. The leader of the association, Lieutenant François de La Rocque, claimed that the "Croix-de-Feu" demonstration was a healthy expression of French patriotism. However, the left-wing parties will hold a grand demonstration there, so maintaining order and preventing conflicts between the left and right depends on the police authorities' ability to prevent them.

<p>(London) People in London believe that the United States should not be criticized from a purely political standpoint with a short-sighted view. However, President Roosevelt's failure in the public works case and the declaration that the National Industrial Recovery Act is in conflict with the constitution make people hope that American business will not be hindered by official interference. The American processing tax has already made $900 million in revenue for the Treasury to subsidize farmers. Now that the question of whether it is legal has arisen, it is even more noteworthy. In order to avoid another crushing defeat, the authorities may prepare to accept smaller concessions regarding the bank amendment. President Roosevelt is in a difficult position between two people: Senator Huey Long, who advocates wealth redistribution, and Father Charles Coughlin, an influential conservative, who uses radio to attack the central relief measures and is highly trusted by the South and Southwest. At the same time, the issue of black people is gradually attracting attention, and it is believed that this matter will soon occupy an important position in politics. All kinds of situations in the United States are uncertain, especially the Agricultural Adjustment Administration.

(4th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of strict punishment for undermining the national currency, the principles were repeatedly resolved by the Central Political Council and sent by the National Government to the Legislative Yuan for compliance. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan and Kong Xiangxi submitted opinions to the Central Government on the case one after another, which were again discussed by the Central Political Council. All the members believed that the government's policy of abolishing taels and adopting yuan was not implemented for long. However, some unscrupulous merchants tried to profit and destroyed national currency in batches to privately mint silver ingots and precious silver. Moreover, they took advantage of the rising world silver prices to smuggle them abroad for sale. Currently, many such cases have been cracked, and the impact is that the losses suffered by the national treasury are not small, and the currency will never be stable. During this transition period, a separate set of regulations should be formulated to strictly ban and remedy this situation. At the same time, Kong Xiangxi submitted a draft of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Acts Undermining National Currency, which was resolved and passed by the Central Political Council and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.

<p>(Hankou) Yuan Shu, who was arrested in connection with the case of the strange Westerner and the Communist Party, has been escorted from Shanghai to Hubei for interrogation. It has now been learned that Yuan Shu confessed that he was absorbed by the Communist Party organization due to his leftist ideology and was responsible for promoting communism. He also submitted a declaration of self-confession, describing in detail his leftist ideology and his experience of joining the Communist Party. The court has now concluded its investigation and believes that there is indeed evidence of promoting doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. He is being prosecuted in accordance with Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China. The original text of the indictment has been obtained and is recorded below. Indictment by the Prosecutor of the Hubei High Court. Defendant: Yuan Shu, male, 25 years old, editor of the Foreign Commentary Translation Agency, residing in Shanghai. The defendant listed on the right is being prosecuted for endangering the Republic of China. The facts of the crime, evidence, and applicable legal articles are listed below. (1) Facts of the Crime: Defendant Yuan Shu is also known as Yuan Xueyi and Yuan Xiaoyi. He received a considerable education. Due to his poor family background and heavy burden, he contributed to newspapers to make a living. He initially approached anarchists and participated in the "Black Youth" movement. He already harbored a sense of hatred towards society. Later, reading social science books aroused his leftist ideology. Because he had a considerable knowledge of journalism, he gathered young leftist elements and founded the Literary and News Weekly. His work was entirely centered on the leftist cultural movement. In the winter of 1931, the date is unknown, when foreign aggression and internal troubles occurred, the defendant was motivated by fanaticism and excitement, believing that only the Communist Party could save China from danger. He often made radical remarks. At that time, the leftist cultural movement developed more and more, and the defendant's appeal to the strength of the young masses became greater and greater, so he was absorbed by the Communist Party organization and served as the editor-in-chief of the Chinese edition of the China Forum Weekly, engaging in communist propaganda work. He also received special training. In May of this year, Joseph Gredon, the head of the Communist Party's Third International Shanghai office, was arrested in Shanghai. The defendant's name and address were found. After receiving the news, the defendant went to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters on the 23rd of the same month to surrender himself. After being interrogated and suspected of being a Communist Party member, he was escorted here. During the investigation, the defendant submitted a declaration of self-confession. The investigation by this court is as described above. (2) Evidence of the Crime and Applicable Legal Articles: The above facts are described in detail in the defendant's declaration of self-confession and repeatedly confessed during the investigation, which can be taken as evidence. The materials collected by the China Forum Weekly are entirely propaganda for communism, which has been clarified by the defendant. Therefore, his promotion of communism, which is incompatible with the Three Principles of the People, for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, is very obvious. In light of his actions, he is a joint offender of Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China in accordance with Articles 11 and 28 of the Criminal Law. He is prosecuted in accordance with Article 1 of the Implementing Regulations of the same law, Article 230, Paragraph 1, and Article 243 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

The ministry explained that although the new Criminal Law does not have special articles on conspiracy offenders, their actions should still be punished as instigation or assistance, depending on the circumstances, and should not be exempted from execution in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. As for those who have been sentenced to crimes under the Regulations on Punishing Evil Gentry, the Regulations on Punishing Kidnappers, and the Special Criminal False Accusation Punishment Law, the nature of the crimes committed under each article should be examined first. If the criminal behavior does not constitute a crime that is punishable under the criminal laws and regulations in effect at the time of the implementation of the new Criminal Law, it should be exempted from execution. The ministry has submitted this interpretation to the Judicial Yuan for approval and has issued a notice to all courts to comply with it. (4th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Changting reports that after being captured by the 36th Division, Qu Qiubai, the former member of the Central Committee and Minister of Education of the Red Bandits, was imprisoned at the division headquarters in Changting for over a month. He received preferential treatment and was given a special cell. Qu was addicted to tobacco and alcohol, consuming a bottle of liquor daily and constantly smoking cigarettes. I visited him twice and saw him writing articles or carving seals at his desk. He wrote a booklet titled "Superfluous Words," filled with melancholy. He was fond of writing poetry, including poems like "Remembering Home," "Puzzled Feelings," and "Self-Deprecation," often quoting lines from Tang Dynasty poets. He carved no fewer than sixty seals, with elegant calligraphy. Qu's face was thin and pale, his body frail, and his head had well-developed nerves. In prison, he wore a blue cotton shirt and pants, resembling a merchant. He spoke with refinement, like a scholar. I had the following conversation with him: (Question) Mr. Qu, what are your thoughts on being captured this time? (Answer) I have been busy with the revolution all my life and longed for a short rest. Being imprisoned is what I expected. (Question) In your opinion, what led to the failure of the Red Bandits this time? (Answer) This failure is purely due to the success of the National Army's policy of "three parts military, seven parts political." The construction of blockhouses, roads, and material blockade also caused difficulties for the Red areas. (Question) Where is your wife, Yang Zhihua, and do you have any communication with her? (Answer) When I left Shanghai for Fujian last February, Yang originally intended to accompany me, but she couldn't due to illness. The situation in Shanghai has deteriorated this year, and the secret organizations have been completely destroyed. I fear she is also a prisoner. (Question) Will you change in any way in the future? (Answer) I am ultimately a scholar and love literature. I hope to translate more literary works in the future. (Question) What are your thoughts on pseudo-communism? Qu smiled without answering and took a drink. Knowing he didn't want to express anything, I excused myself.</p>
<p>On June 15th, Qu went to the New Life Club to read the newspaper. The guards closely attended him. He saw me again, nodded in greeting, and smiled amiably before busily reading the newspaper. I did not speak with him. On the 17th, he received a telegram from the central government ordering him to be executed on the spot. The next morning (the 18th) at 8 AM, Liao Xiangguang, the company commander of the special service company, went to the prison to take Qu to Zhongshan Park for a photograph. Qu gladly accompanied him. After the photo was taken, Commander Liao showed him the order. Qu nodded and said heroically, "Death is the greatest rest in life." Commander Liao asked if he had any last words. Qu replied, "I have a poem that I haven't written down yet." He returned to his cell, took up his brush, and wrote the following poem and preface: "Evening of June 17, 1935, I dreamed of walking on a mountain path. The setting sun flickered, and the cold stream gurgled, as if I were in a fairyland. The next day, reading a Tang Dynasty poem, I suddenly saw the line 'The setting sun flickers amid the chaotic mountains.' I then composed a poem with collected lines: 'The setting sun flickers amid the chaotic mountains; the falling leaves and cold spring sound different; I have endured ten years of loneliness; my heart holds half a verse of emptiness.' I was about to write it out</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>when the order for my execution arrived. It is lamentable." Qiubai once wrote, "When the clouds and mist pass from my eyes, it will be my time of leisure." "These are not lyrics but words expressing my feelings in prison." Not signed, Qiubai's last writing completed. He then walked to Zhongshan Park, drank a catty of baijiu in a pavilion, talked and laughed freely, and sang the Russian Internationale and the Red Army Song, his voice trembling and barely audible. After singing, he slowly walked to the execution ground, holding a cigarette and remaining calm. Upon reaching the execution ground, he sat cross-legged on the grass, nodding and smiling. A moment later, a shot rang out, and he fell dead. The onlookers thronged the streets, expressing their satisfaction. The charges against him are listed below: "Regarding the announcement of the charges, the bandit leader Qu Qiubai joined the Communist Party in Moscow, Russia, in 1921 and has been working for the party ever since. In 1923, he was sent back to China to join our party, harboring sinister schemes to turn the whole country into a bandit state, and willingly becoming a dog for the Third International. After our National Revolutionary Army reached Wuhan in 1927, the bandit's schemes became increasingly exposed. The leaders of our party began to declare their opposition to communism with decisive measures. At that time, the bandit was in charge of the pseudo-Central Political Bureau, the highest leading organ of the bandit party. Seeing that his schemes were not succeeding, he advocated for adventurism, advocating for the seizure of power through bandit-style actions. As a result, countless innocent civilians in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Anhui were unjustly killed under his oppression and threats, numbering in the hundreds of thousands. The provinces suffered horrific destruction of burning and killing, which has its origins here. In 1928, the bandit returned to Russia, serving as a representative of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1930, he returned to China, still serving as a member of the pseudo-Central Committee, hiding in Shanghai and handling supplies to bandits in Jiangxi. Last February, he sneaked into Ruijin, serving as a pseudo-Education People's Commissioner of the bandit party, attempting to turn the children of Jiangxi and Fujian into bandits to serve as a bandit base. Last August, the main force of the bandit army fled westward, and the bandit stayed in the countryside of Ruijin, organizing a pseudo-Central Office to command the remnants of bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi to continue their harassment. This February, due to our army's suppression, he realized that his efforts would fail and attempted to move to Shanghai. On March 20th, he attempted to deceive us in the hope of being released, and only confessed after strict interrogation. In short, all the actions of the Communist bandits in various regions since 1927 are due to this bandit's instigation. The lives and property of the provinces of Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Sichuan have been directly or indirectly subjected to this bandit's killing and destruction, and the numbers cannot be counted. His crimes are heinous and unforgivable, especially since the bandit's conspiracies and disruptions have led to this □□□□, □□□□, even more so he is a thousand-year criminal against the country and the nation. It is not enough to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin to atone for his crimes. Fortunately, the bandit's brutal tricks have been witnessed by the people of the country and are intolerable to the world. That is why, over the years, through the efforts of our army and people in encirclement and suppression, most of them have been wiped out. Especially since the bandit was captured, the Communist bandits have lost their leadership, and the remaining bandits will easily be eliminated. The ministry reported to the chairman of the military committee, Chiang, for instructions, and received the winter telegram, 'Qu Qiubai to be executed by firing squad in Fujian and photographed for verification,' etc. In addition to verifying the bandit's identity and tying him to the execution ground for execution by firing squad, this proclamation is hereby issued so that the public knows. Bandit leader Qu Qiubai, 38 years old, from Changzhou, Jiangsu."</p>

<p>A dispatch from Wuhu reports that in recent days, the counties of southern Anhui have experienced violent winds and heavy rains. The river tides have risen sharply, causing reverse flow, and mountain torrents have rushed down, causing the water level to increase by several feet. Although the weather has fortunately been clear and calm recently, the temperature has dropped, and the water volume continues to rise unabated. In the hinterland, Xuanzhou, Jingxian, and other places have experienced flood dragon disasters, with water flowing downstream and rising by more than three feet in a single day. As of last night, the water volume at the junction of the Wuhu inland river and the Yangtze River has reached 26 feet 5 inches on the customs water gauge, only four feet away from the great flood of 1931. Therefore, low-lying areas along the riverbanks of Nanmen and Jinmamen in Wuhu have been completely submerged. As for the embankments, the Wuzhang Lake in the fourth district, the Gaoyan, Zhangqiu, and Duxing dams in the sixth district, the Donghu beach in the seventh district, and the Zhucun embankment in the entrance district were breached last night due to the impact of mountain torrents, inundating more than 20,000 acres of farmland. Furthermore, Wan Chun and Xing Chun, each in the enclosure, have also experienced major dangers. The embankments encompass 80,000 to 90,000 acres of farmland, and thousands of people are working day and night to rescue them, with the situation extremely tense. Gao Wenbo, the commissioner of the Second District Administrative Inspectorate and concurrently the magistrate of Wuhu County, has led Construction Commissioner Hou Hongkai and hydraulic engineering personnel to inspect and assist in rescue efforts in various districts. He has also dispatched a large security team to garrison along the Yangtze River embankments, assisting the civilians in defense. Furthermore, the embankments along the west bank of Datong and Yuezizhou are of great importance to the water conservancy of Tongling, Shidai, and Qingyang. However, a portion of them suddenly collapsed the night before due to strong winds and rain, submerging nearby farmland. Datong and other places have largely been submerged. Fortunately, the inner embankments are high, thick, and sturdy. The local public security bureau led the security team, gathering hundreds of people, and prepared wooden piles, reed mats, and other materials to intensify the rescue efforts, preventing flooding. As for transportation, the impact has been even greater. On the Jiangnan Railway Company's Jin-Sun section, several sections of track between Xuancheng and Sunjiapu have been submerged, preventing traffic. Trains from Nanjing can only travel to Xuancheng via Wuhu. The Wutun Highway has been submerged near Wanzhi, and traffic has been interrupted. Buses have been suspended. It is reported that Xuancheng to Tunxi can still barely operate. The Huizhou-Hangzhou Highway has also been damaged, obstructing traffic. People's hearts in various places are now extremely uneasy. If it continues to rain for the next ten days, there is a great risk of complete submersion. (3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Shandong: Unprecedented Crisis in the Cotton Industry; Severe Drought in Cotton Areas; Cotton Harvest This Year Is Almost Hopeless; More Than 100,000 Bales of Cotton Stockpiled in Jinan Are Stagnant <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that cotton production accounts for a large proportion of Shandong's rural production. The annual output ranks first in the province's economic income. The banking industry in Jinan handles more than 10 million yuan in cotton mortgage loans each year, not including Qingdao. The relationship between the cotton industry and Shandong's economy can be imagined from this. The Department of Construction, in order to develop Shandong's economy, has devoted itself to the expansion of cotton and the improvement of the trial planting of American No. 36 Drilles cotton for several years, and has achieved great success. Therefore, this year, more than 2 million catties of cotton seeds will be distributed to various counties without charge to expand cotton fields in order to develop the cotton industry and relieve the rural economy. Unexpectedly, due to the impact of the domestic economic downturn, cotton in Jinan is stagnant and prices have fallen. The cotton accumulated on the market reached 130,000 to 140,000 bales. Although it has gradually become active in the past three to five days, there are still 110,000 to 120,000 bales that are stagnant and unsalable. Cotton merchants and flower shops are all crying out in pain. The most dangerous thing is the poor cotton harvest this year. This year, there has been a severe drought in various counties in Shandong. Although there has been rain in eastern and southern Shandong recently, there has been no rain in the cotton area of northern Shandong, including Linqing, Weihai, Gaotang, Tangyi, Xiajin, Qiuxian, Guanxian, Tangyi, Qingping, and Wucheng. Most of the cotton has not been planted, and the land is barren for thousands of miles. The harvest is hopeless, and the loss is no less than tens of millions of yuan, which has a huge impact on the rural economy of Shandong. Han Fuju, the chairman of the provincial government, has ordered the Department of Construction to quickly seek relief measures for the stagnant cotton and unplanted cotton fields, and set a deadline for implementation before the 15th of this month. Therefore, Zhang Honglie, the director of the Department of Construction, specially convened personnel related to the cotton industry throughout the province to Jinan to discuss everything. A meeting was held in the Department of Construction this morning (the 1st). Those who attended included Zhang Honglie, the director of the Department of Construction, Zhu Zhuxun, the chief of the First Section, Chen Shican, the technician, Wang Tengyun, the director of the Gaotang First Branch of the Shandong Cotton Talent Water Talent Miscellaneous Management Office, Zhu Zigui, the director of the Linqing Second Branch, Yang Dongtai, the director of the Zhangdian Third Branch, and the inspectors from Xiajin, Qiuxian, Guanxian, Tangyi, Qingping, Wucheng, and other six counties. Generally, the directors of the branches and the inspectors first reported on the cotton industry in their respective areas and whether the personnel in the office had any difficulties in their work. After the directors and inspectors finished their reports, it was noon, and the adjournment was announced. It was decided to continue the meeting tomorrow (the 2nd) to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Reporters interviewed Zhu Zigui, Wang Tengyun, and Yang Dongfeng separately about the situation in the cotton area of northern Shandong. According to them, northern Shandong is a cotton-producing area. This year, there was a severe drought without rain, and most of the cotton seeds have not been planted. The harvest is hopeless, and the loss is no less than tens of millions of yuan. The cotton-producing areas include Linqing, Gaotang, Xiajin, Qiuxian, Guanxian, Tangyi, Qingping, and Wucheng. Linqing County has more than 10,000 hectares of farmland, of which cotton fields account for 7,000 hectares. The average yield per mu is 80 catties of cotton, and the total output can reach 56 million catties of cotton. The price is 15 cents per catty, with a total value of 8.4 million yuan. Last year, due to the spring drought and poor harvest, each mu only yielded 60 catties, which was only 70% of the previous year. In addition, the price of cotton has fallen, and the loss has been not small. This year, not a drop of rain has fallen, and the cotton has not been planted. Even those who have watered and planted cotton only account for a very small number. The loss cannot be calculated. Gaotang County has more than 7,000 hectares of farmland, of which cotton fields account for more than 4,000 hectares. In previous years, each mu produced 80 to 90 catties of cotton, with a total output of about 32 million catties. At 15 cents per catty, the total value is 4.8 million yuan. Last year, due to the drought and poor harvest, only 60% to 70% was harvested. This year, the cotton planted only accounts for 60% to 70% of the 4,000 hectares. In other counties, the cotton was not planted due to the drought. As for Zhangdian, it is the place where cotton from Binzhou, Putai, and Lijin in northern Shandong is concentrated for export. The annual cotton concentrated passing through is within 200,000 dan. At present, flower shops in northern Shandong are mostly fleeing due to the low price of cotton, and the situation is extremely pitiful. (July 1st)</p>

<p>Pan Jinxian, the judicial secretary of the county government, and Zhang Shuhau, the assistant of the First District Office, were suddenly accused of smoking opium. The Department of Civil Affairs secretly ordered County Magistrate Yang Zhuomao to personally search their residences on the night of April 18, but no evidence was found. On the 20th, Pan and Zhang were summoned and sent to the county's drug rehabilitation center for examination, but no drug addiction was found. Last month, Pan and others petitioned for a thorough investigation. The county submitted the case to the Department of Civil Affairs, which returned the case for investigation. According to the address provided by the plaintiffs Jiang Yunwang and Hu Jingen, and the Yongtai store that guaranteed them, the police were sent to Ruan Lane to investigate, but no such person was found. However, the handwriting on the original petition appeared to be the work of Ye Fengshu, a doctor from that area. The county government summoned him, verified the handwriting, and he confessed that he was asked to write it by Jiang's younger brother. When Jiang was arrested last month and questioned with Ye, both parties confessed the truth of the case, which was entirely fabricated by Zhu Zhenhua and Wang Yifeng, who ran pharmacies in the area. Therefore, County Magistrate Yang, in addition to arresting Zhu Zhenhua on the 2nd and sentencing him to six months in prison for false accusation, ordered the arrest of Wang Yifeng, who was on the run.</p>

<p>Chen Chunsheng from Guangfu Town stabbed his father, Xiangzhou, five times in the chest, abdomen, neck, and legs with a sharp knife the day before yesterday. Xiangzhou immediately bled profusely, fell to the ground, and cried for help. When Xiangzhou's wife, Gu, and neighbor Zhang Yaochun arrived, he had already died. Chunsheng had also taken the opportunity to escape. Xiangzhou's father, Yongqing, reported the incident to the town's guardhouse, which reported it to the county government. The county government went to examine the body and confirmed that Chen Xiangzhou had died from stab wounds. An order was issued to the family to prepare the coffin and to arrest the murderer for investigation.</p>

<p>The Wuxi Sericulture Model Area established 80 branch guidance centers in various townships throughout the county for spring sericulture this year. Recently, due to the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Association's reduction of funding for autumn sericulture, it was decided to convene a meeting of the directors of the central guidance centers on the 6th to determine the reduction of 60 centers. In order to stabilize the market and resist the high-handed manipulation of seed vendors, the area ordered 100,000 sheets of silkworm eggs and distributed them to various townships for silkworm farmers to purchase. The Silkworm Seed Industry Association also convened a general meeting of members on the 4th and resolved: (1) to establish a silkworm seed promotion department to handle the sales of silkworm seeds; (2) the model area plans to order 100,000 sheets of autumn seed and should be asked to purchase as much as possible from the association, at least 50%; (3) to hold a re-election on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e94">National Goods Market Building Collapses <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The National Goods Market on Gongyuan Road was organized by Fan Jingwen and others in the winter of 1933. Not long after its opening, Fan was imprisoned for the Xie Sheng commemorative edition fire case. The market also closed due to poor business. Last year, it was rented to a Shanghai national goods manufacturer for a period of time to promote its inventory at the original site, but it closed again in less than a month. The building has been closed ever since, with only the three front rooms rented to Cheng Zhiliang, a fortune teller. Cheng Bingruo, the landlord, and Wang Shouji, the contractor who built the building, sued the court one after another for rent and short-paid construction fees, and the remaining buildings were sealed. Unexpectedly, due to continuous moldy rain recently, the building, which was originally very shoddy, completely collapsed on the afternoon of the 4th. Fortunately, it was during the day and no one was injured. The high wall in front is also crumbling and may be dangerous. The Construction Bureau has hired workers to demolish it.</p>

<p>At about 10 PM on the 2nd, five men dressed in civilian clothes and speaking in mixed accents suddenly came to the Jichang Oil Factory in Magong Bridge, a suburb west of Wujin. Two of them entered the door, ostensibly to talk about business, and then pulled out pistols, forcibly borrowing silver dollars. Three people stood guard outside and cut the telephone line. They forced Shao Zhizhen, a partner, to hand over the hidden silver dollars and robbed him of more than 50 silver dollars and 670-80 cents in small silver coins. Before leaving, they instructed the factory workers to close the door tightly and not to make any noise. The public security authorities only received a report of the robbery on the morning of the 3rd and went to investigate and confirmed that it was true. Special detectives were sent out to investigate. In order to prevent robberies from occurring recently, it was decided that from the night of the 3rd, all night guards would carry guns for patrol to prevent accidents.</p>

<p>Recently, the Jiahe Cloth Factory in the north of Jiaxing City has been experiencing sluggish sales, and the price of goods has been affected by the poor market conditions, gradually declining. Therefore, the wages have been temporarily reduced by five cents. That is, the wages are set at 55 cents per bolt of flannel, 45 cents per bolt of factory cloth, and 40 cents per bolt of striped bleached cloth. All workers opposed this because it affected their livelihood and went on strike. They also requested assistance from the Party headquarters. Xu Jingxing was dispatched to the factory by the county Party headquarters to mediate. After much negotiation, it was agreed that the wages for striped cloth and factory cloth would be reduced by five cents per bolt, and the wages for flannel would be paid at the original price. The workers also agreed and unanimously resumed work in the afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Recent Brief Report from the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Daye</p>
<p>Origin</p>
<p>The proposal to establish this bureau was made during the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign in the late Qing Dynasty. It was initially proposed by the Finance Department and subsequently discussed and approved by the Ministry of Revenue to establish regulations specifically for printing banknotes, with the aim of unifying currency and reclaiming economic rights. Therefore, the planning of the steel engraving department at that time was particularly detailed compared to other departments. Simultaneously, five American technicians were hired at great expense to be responsible for and teach this technology. However, the matter was in its initial stages, the scope was limited, and implementation was slow. It was not until June of the Xuantong reign that steel engraving printing could be done independently without foreign assistance. After the founding of the Republic of China, the bureau continued its previous work and further improved, achieving a large scale and clear organization. Since then, the equipment has become more complete, the business has become more developed, and the steel engraving technology has gained a reputation in East Asia.</p>
<p>From the establishment of this bureau to the present year, it has been twenty-seven years. The change of the national system and the turmoil of the political situation have had a significant impact on the bureau's affairs. The replacement of bureau directors has been almost annual. A business organization has been treated like a relay station for promotions. As a result, many have followed old habits and sought immediate benefits, while few have been forward-thinking and kept pace with the times. This description of the origin cannot help but evoke emotion.</p>
<p>(1) Establishment of the Bureau: In the 33rd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the Ministry of Revenue requested the establishment of a special bureau to print banknotes to unify currency and reclaim economic rights. The court approved the request, marking the beginning of this bureau. Since it was a new undertaking, many things were unclear. In addition to selecting a site in Baizhifang, first building a surrounding wall and several courtyards of old-style bungalows as preparation and office space, special personnel were appointed to investigate in the United States for guidance. Therefore, the overall construction design was drawn up by the American Miller &amp; Brown Company. The civil engineering and construction were contracted to Japanese merchant Hua Sheng, and the mechanical installation was contracted to the American Lao Qichang foreign firm. All installations followed the regulations of the U.S. National Printing Bureau in Washington, D.C. In addition, three buildings in the east courtyard were built for staff accommodation and rest. Construction began in the summer of the Xuantong reign. During this time, an imperial decree was issued to merge the printing bureau established by the Ministry of Posts and Communications with this bureau. Simultaneously, three factories for letterpress printing were added and completed within a year. The main building project was not fully completed until the third year of the Republic of China, and the scale of the only printing bureau in the East was thus determined.</p>
<p>(2) Location of the Bureau: Located in Baizhifang inside Zhangyi Gate in Beijing, it occupies the extreme southwest corner of the city. It was the former site of the Qing Ministry of Works' gunpowder bureau. The rear and sides of the bureau wall are only dozens of steps away from the outer city wall. The total area of the bureau is about one million square feet, equivalent to more than 150 acres.</p>
<p>(3) Changes in the Bureau Name: It was initially named the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Revenue. After the national system was updated, the Ministry of Revenue was renamed the Ministry of Finance, and the bureau was renamed the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. When the National Government moved south last year, the character "Ping" was added, becoming the Beiping Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>(4) Changes in the Bureau System: The head of this bureau was initially designated as a simplified position. In the Republic, it was changed to an appointed position. The person in charge was initially called the Director-General, with seated managers to assist. In the Republic, the Director-General was renamed the Bureau Director, and the titles of seated manager and co-manager were abolished. Underneath were the affairs and engineering departments, each governing six sections. In the Republic, the two departments were renamed the General Affairs and Engineering Sections, and the sections were renamed departments. In 1920, they were renamed the Business Office and Engineering Office, and the departments under their jurisdiction were renamed sections, which remains the case today.</p>
<p>(5) Advancement of Technology: When this bureau was first established, it was primarily responsible for printing banknotes of the Qing Bank, as well as stamps, revenue stamps, train tickets, public bonds, official documents, diplomas, contracts, grain receipts, salt and tea permits, broker licenses, and various official securities. At that time, regulations for the handover between the Post Office and the Printing Bureau were issued, and various regulations for distribution and anti-counterfeiting were formulated, which served as the foundation for printing in this bureau. At that time, regarding the engraving of steel plates and the printing of banknotes, since there was no such technology in the country, five engraving and steel plate experts were hired from the United States, and apprentices were recruited to train in engraving Qing banknotes.</p>
<p>(7) Revision of Bureau Regulations: In the Xuantong reign, when the preparation of this bureau was almost complete and work began, twenty-eight regulations were enacted to serve as guidelines for handling affairs. By 1916, the scale was complete, and the affairs became more complex, so they were added and amended and submitted to the ministry for record, but no special edition was published. In 1926, when Pu was in charge, revisions were added, and they were compiled into a book. It has been in use for over ten years, and with the passage of time and changes, it feels inappropriate. It is necessary to adopt the latest scientific management methods, carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages, and make detailed revisions in order to keep pace with the times and avoid falling behind. An order from the Ministry has been submitted for approval.</p>
<p>One-Year Review</p>
<p>(A) Review of the Previous Year's Situation: This bureau is a state-owned printing institution, established for twenty-seven years. Investments have exceeded millions, including the construction of factory buildings, the equipment of machinery, and the training of technical personnel, all of which have been described in the Origin chapter and will not be repeated here. However, due to repeated political changes and improper management, the bureau's debts have accumulated daily, and the situation is bleak. This was the situation reported last year on April and May. When Daye and others were ordered by the Ministry to take charge here, they investigated the accumulated losses of the bureau in the past and divided them into four categories: (1) Undelivered printed products: (A) A total of two batches of stamp tax tickets were owed, totaling six million sheets, with approximately over two hundred thousand yuan already collected. (B) Various valuable securities, with approximately over two hundred thousand yuan already collected in deposit money, and over one hundred thousand yuan designated for outstanding printing fees. The total is over seven hundred thousand yuan. (2) Bank loans: Loans from various banks that must be repaid immediately amount to over one million yuan. (3) Wage arrears: Unpaid salaries and wages for staff and workers total approximately seventy thousand yuan. (4) Losses on goods are no less than over one million yuan. At that time, in the midst of decline, there were such huge and urgent debts, and the unfavorable environment had reached its extreme. In addition, with the government moving south, all printed products were printed nearby. The headquarters of various banks moved to Shanghai, and there was less business in North China. This bureau worried that there were too many people and too few jobs, and it was not enough to cover expenses. Restructuring was not easy. However, the staff persisted, worked hard to reorganize, and set goals to be achieved. Although there has been no significant progress in one year, there have been gradual beginnings.</p>
<p>(B) Reorganization Situation in One Year: (1) Factory Reorganization: This bureau has thousands of craftsmen and apprentices with complex backgrounds. In the past, inspectors dared not seriously supervise, so the work was unorganized. At times, due to a lack of materials, some parts of the factory stopped working, while others rushing to produce finished products had to be processed separately. Half of the machines in each section were operating and half were stopped, and the losses in salaries and wages were huge, which was the main reason for previous losses. Recently, for the sake of reorganization, the various parts have been tightly and appropriately allocated. For all bureau workers, suitable ones are divided into two shifts, working in rotation, so that the printing machines are never idle and each worker has adequate rest. As for the materials used, they are ordered to be fully prepared in advance, so that all printed products can be completed on time, and wages can be saved. At the same time, the inspection section is ordered to seriously supervise. Over the past year, it has been quite effective. (2) Increasing Work Rate: Comparing and averaging the products of the factory in June, July, August, and September of the past year with those of previous years, the monthly output is approximately 180,000 yuan, an increase of one-third compared to previous years, which is the highest record of output rate in recent years for this bureau. (3) Reduction of Defective Products: In previous years, the defective products produced by the factory were worth about five percent. Recently, after ordering the engineering office to strictly supervise and implement rewards and punishments, it has now been reduced to thirteen percent, saving a lot of labor and materials throughout the year. (4) Reducing Fuel Consumption: Previously, all fuel was purchased from Kailuan Coal Mines. Because it was purchased in small quantities, the monthly cost was very high. Now it has been changed to bulk orders from Datong Kouquan Baoheng Company. Other scattered lump coal for furnaces is temporarily purchased from Kailuan. Beforehand, samples of Baoheng coal were ordered to be thoroughly tested by the responsible section, and the coal quality was excellent and the firepower was very strong. The actual burning results show that the monthly quantity required can be reduced by about 30% compared to Kailuan coal, while the price is the same. The full month can save at least more than one thousand yuan compared to using idle Kailuan coal. As for the number of furnaces opened each day, it is ordered by the engineering office to be determined temporarily according to the amount of printed products, in order to save fuel. Other measures to crack down on coal receiving staff and coal-burning workers are assigned to the section chiefs of the warehouse, machinery inspection, and other sections to be responsible for reporting at any time. (5) Establishment of a Material Purchasing Committee: Previously, the purchase of materials was all controlled by the purchasers themselves, and the examination was inevitably incomplete. There was no selection of the quality of the materials, and the prices were also expensive. Recently, a material purchasing committee has been established, jointly organized by the directors and section chiefs of various offices. All materials purchased are adopted using the method of open bidding, selecting those with the lowest price and excellent quality. It avoids being subject to the merchant's judgment and completely eliminates previous malpractices. Here are a few examples of the prices of materials used in the past and the prices of materials currently used, listed for comparison to examine the progress and decline of the past and present. (Table omitted) (6) Establishment of an Accounting Audit Committee: Previously, the revenue and expenditure of this bureau had never been carefully audited, so the annual budget and final accounts could not be prepared, strictly implemented. Now, an accounting audit committee has been established. All revenue and expenditure, as well as budgets and final accounts, must be submitted for review in order to ensure that no funds are wasted and that the accounts are accurate. (7) Formulation of Detailed Rules for Handling Affairs: Previously, each section only had temporary rules for handling affairs, which were not strictly followed and were mostly inconsistent with the actual situation, so there were often doubts when handling affairs. Rules were immediately drafted so that each section could follow them in handling affairs to facilitate progress. (8) Reducing Expenses: Previously, the amount of wages required for every 100,000 yuan of products was 29,300 yuan, and the price of materials required was approximately 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Now, through efforts to save money, the amount of wages required for every 100,000 yuan of products is 22,600 yuan, which is actually a reduction of more than 6,000 yuan compared to the past, and the price of materials required is approximately 50,000 yuan, which is actually a reduction of more than 10,000 yuan to over 10,000 yuan compared to the past. (9) Establishment of an Art Research Association: The printed products of this bureau have not been very well received by society in terms of art. As a result, major banks order banknotes from abroad. This is not only a shortcoming of steel plate engraving in the printing bureau, but also the biggest leak in our country. Now, an art research association has been established to mutually observe and earnestly improve what can be imitated and what can be adopted in the new trends of modern work and the excellent technology of Europe and the United States. We must promote the elimination of the old and bring forth the new in order to expand business and prevent the outflow of economic rights. The progress that has been made includes various fine lines and multi-color overprinting to prevent counterfeiting. The items printed in recent months seem to have new and innovative contributions. (10) Making Up for Accumulated Losses: Previously, 600,000 stamp tax tickets were owed, with a total price of approximately 340,000 yuan. Various valuable securities, with approximately 300,000 yuan already collected in deposit money. Loans from various banks that must be repaid immediately amount to over 600,000 yuan. Unpaid salaries and wages for staff and workers total approximately 70,000 yuan. Overdue payments for goods amount to over 100,000 yuan. The total is over one million yuan. Now, within one year, the current director has repaid approximately 90,000 yuan in principal and interest to the Central Bank, China Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, and Hebei Bank on behalf of the previous director, as well as other scattered debts, paid 50,000 yuan in arrears of salaries and wages, and paid 150,000 yuan for printing costs in various places, with the accumulated losses being made up for being approximately over 500,000 yuan. If the business develops in the future and all domestic bank banknotes are printed by this bureau, then the previous debts can be gradually paid off.</p>
<p>The difference between steel engraving printing and other printing. The essential elements for the production of printed matter rely entirely on the printing surface, equipment, and ink. Each printing surface has its own machine and ink to match it. And each printing surface is divided into various procedures such as engraving and plating. Engraving is the process by which the original plate is made. Both steel engraving and ordinary engraving are different and more difficult. The engraving methods are roughly divided into three types: (1) using thick and thin horizontal lines to distinguish between yin and yang, (2) using thick and thin warp and weft lines to distinguish between yin and yang, and (3) adding dots to vary the density to distinguish between yin and yang. Please try examining the banknotes and stamps of various countries with a microscope, and you will be able to see the difference. However, it is impossible to see the mystery with the naked eye. The most famous steel engraving artist in the past was an American named Haichu. This bureau once hired him as a professor at a high cost of 1,500 US dollars per month, and he stayed in the bureau for five years. This person is now deceased. Plating is the process of engraving the size of the original plate on the steel shaft with large and small patterns and the size of the large plate, which is more important work and has special machines for it. Nowadays, the most important printed products used in various countries around the world are bank banknotes and tax stamps. However, countries have different habits for important printed products, so the printing surfaces used are also different. For example, the United States mostly combines steel intaglio and copper relief printing. In the old Russian era, the five-color patterns printed on the ruble notes were exquisite and unparalleled in the world. European, American, and countries all imitated them, but they never achieved the same level of exquisiteness because the machines they used have not been made public to the world. This proves that the three types of printing, printing surface, machine, and ink, are equally important and indispensable. We will not discuss the machine and ink for now. Let's first talk about the types, properties, and uses of the printing surface. The printing surface has three types: relief, planographic, and intaglio. Relief prints are those where the text and patterns are raised above the surface of the printing surface, such as ordinary lead plates and woodblocks. Planographic prints are those where the text and patterns are level with the printing surface. When making the printing surface, another kind of chemical is used to make the printing surface have the effect of attracting and repelling ink, such as today's lithographic and rubber printing surfaces. Intaglio prints are those where the text and patterns are recessed below the surface of the printing surface, which is the opposite of relief prints. When printing, the ink absorbed by the paper from this depression forms the text, which is today's steel printing surface. The reason why steel is used for intaglio prints is that it is strong, tough, and dense, while copper is slightly inferior to steel. Therefore, the text and patterns engraved on a copper printing surface cannot be as deep and fine as those on a steel printing surface. If you engrave fine and dense lines, you can clearly distinguish them on a steel printing surface, but you cannot distinguish them on a copper printing surface. Sometimes two lines may even become one line because the material is not as dense as steel. The same is true for width and depth. In the engraving of landscape patterns, the most important thing is the contrast of light and dark, which depends on the depth of the lines. The ability of the lines to distinguish between depth depends on the density of the printing surface material. Steel printing surfaces are able to engrave deeply because of their fine and dense material, while copper is not. In terms of printing, copper is stronger than copper. If a copper printing surface is printed too many times, the engraved patterns will become blurred and unrecognizable, and even the printing surface will be polished and the patterns will disappear. Steel printing surfaces do not easily have this phenomenon because of their strong material. Moreover, the printing surface is definitely not something that can be used by a single block, so there are various procedures such as the original printing surface. Steel printing surfaces can be used to engrave shafts with original printing surfaces, which are cylindrical rollers. Then, the engraved shaft is used to plate large copper printing surfaces or six-open or eight-open printing surfaces, each with the same patterns. If it is a copper printing surface, the material is extremely soft. After the original printing surface is made, it cannot be mounted on a shaft. What it relies on is photography or wax plating electroplating. The large printing surfaces plated with photography and wax plating can also be divided into several parts, but their patterns must not be accurate. Furthermore, steel printing surfaces use specially made soft steel printing surfaces for engraving and plating. After the printing surface is made, it is hardened by fire, making it harder than normal. The machines and operations for hardening with fire are difficult to describe in a few words. Copper printing surfaces cannot be hardened by smelting, but only steel has this effect. After the printing surface is smelted and hardened, it can withstand the heavy pressure of the printing machine, but copper printing surfaces cannot withstand heavy pressure. If the printing surface is pressed, the patterns will not change easily. If it is not pressed, the patterns will change easily. Therefore, countries like China and the United States use steel intaglio printing for the most important banknotes and tax stamps, and are unwilling to use copper intaglio printing because this is the key. Nowadays, printing technology is extremely developed, and the distinction between copper printing surfaces and steel printing surfaces is not very clear to the general public, so I will briefly describe it without being too tedious.</p>
<p>notes, and pointing to the printing of stamps, tax tickets and various steel plates. By the third and fourth years of the Republic, the apprentices had made great progress and were gradually able to come up with their own ideas. In 1916, another class of apprentices was added to continue learning. Afterwards, only one foreign technician, Gellan, was retained to provide advice and consultation. In 1927, Gellan also terminated his contract and left. Since then, the steel plate work of this bureau has been entirely made by Chinese people and no longer relies on foreigners. All the products are no less inferior to those made in Europe and the United States. They have won the best award certificates and medals in various international product competitions in Tsintao.</p>
<p>(6) Purchase of Machines: Once the proposal to establish this bureau was decided, personnel were first sent to the United States to purchase and transport all the machines. At the same time, the building was built, and the machines were installed and completed. Although there were subsequent additions, they were small-scale or partial machine parts, and no major construction was added. Notable events include receiving 900,000 jin of ingots from the Baoquan Bureau in the third year of Xuantong to add to the casting of lead type. In 1912, paper cutting machines, lead printing machines, lithographic printing machines, punching machines, and color lithographic printing machines were added. In 1915, lead printing machines from the first library branch were purchased, and American zinc plate printing machines, electroplating machines, and plating machines were ordered, and zinc plate printing machines were first used. In 1921, telephone switchboards were added. In 1922, technician Shen Yongbin successfully researched multi-color printing and set up multi-color machines, which was the beginning of multi-color printing for this bureau.</p>

<p>To the reporter, I have recently read a news item in your newspaper on May 16 entitled "Pointing to the Good as Prostitutes and Inciting a Strike." After investigation, many of the facts do not match the truth. Banning prostitution and gambling is the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau. Inciting a strike on this pretext and gathering crowds inside the Public Security Bureau to carry out coercion is a crime under Articles 142 and 143 of the Criminal Law. This bureau is now investigating the instigators and sending them to the county for legal action in order to warn the stubborn and deter the prestige. As for destroying the sound waves, it was originally the section chief of the second section of this bureau. Because the branch director Zhang Jue asked for a week's leave, Yin was temporarily appointed as a substitute. He has now been transferred back to his original position and there is no matter of dismissal or investigation. I am hereby informing you, hoping that you will correct it accordingly. Sincerely, the editor-in-chief of the Central Daily News, the Public Security Bureau of Haimen County, July 1st.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth, Miscellaneous Grain, Flour, Gold Industry, and Securities Exchanges, etc., believing that the government planned to levy a transaction tax starting on July 1st, repeatedly sent representatives to request the authorities to postpone the levy. The Ministry of Finance approved the request. The chairmen of the five exchanges sent a joint letter to Minister of Finance Kong to express their gratitude. The original text of the letter read: "To Minister Yonggong: With utmost respect, we, the representatives of the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth, Miscellaneous Grain, Flour, Gold Industry, and Securities Exchanges, are submitting this letter. We previously requested your ministry to postpone the transaction tax due to the economic panic and depression in all industries. We are grateful for your consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses and your care for industry and commerce.

<h3 id="e106">Shipping Fees for Goods to the United States Will Increase; To be Implemented from August 1st <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The shipping of goods from Shanghai to the United States is divided into two routes: the Pacific Line and the New York Line. The shipping fees for each route are determined by the Shipping Fee Conference composed of various foreign shipping companies. All member companies that join the conference must charge according to the fixed rate and are not allowed to increase or decrease the fees without authorization. Recently, due to the relationship between gold prices, the exchange rate has changed compared to before, and the shipping rates set for each route are mostly based on US dollars, which is not very cost-effective when converted into Shanghai silver dollars. Therefore, various shipping companies, such as Dollar, Changxing, Nippon Yusen, Osaka, Blue Funnel, Jardine, and Pacific, sent representatives to a meeting to increase the shipping fees for goods on each route, otherwise the exchange rate would be too low. After discussion, the representatives of the companies decided that the shipping prices for goods on both the Pacific Line and the New York Line will be increased uniformly from August 1st, by approximately one to three US dollars per ton. All goods must be fully increased. The amount to be increased is currently being proposed, and the amount of the increase will be determined based on whether the goods are essential or secondary.</p>

In order to facilitate travel for passengers, as soon as the station starts operation, it is proposed to join the domestic passenger intermodal ticketing system.  Furthermore, Xintangbian Station on this railway is a transit point for people traveling to and from Guangfeng, Jiangxi, and the surrounding areas, so passengers often request to purchase intermodal tickets at that station.  It is now proposed to join the domestic intermodal transportation system at the same time as Shangrao Station.  Apart from the ticket prices, which will be submitted later after the implementation date is determined, all the reasons for proposing to add Shangrao and Xintangbian stations to the domestic passenger intermodal ticketing system are hereby submitted for your review and approval, and it is requested that they be forwarded to all intermodal railways for their information, etc.  In addition to instructing that it be approved and implemented, it is urgently ordered that the railway comply accordingly.</p>

<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the World Bank at 400 Fuzhou Road was established on January 5, 1930, and registered with the government on April 2, 1931, with a capital of 200,000 national currency units. It has a history of six years. It engages in both commercial and savings operations, and its lending activities have been relatively stable. Recently, due to the economic downturn, loan repayments have been difficult to collect, causing a temporary inability to circulate funds. The bank's board of directors decided to temporarily cease operations yesterday morning. It has been found that the bank currently has savings deposits of approximately 500,000 units, and the government bonds deposited with the Central Bank are valued at approximately 130,000 to 140,000 units at current market prices. The assets are sufficient to cover the liabilities, so there should be no problem for depositors to withdraw their savings in the future. The manager of the bank was originally Xie Yuru, but since Mr. Xie left office due to personal reasons, the deputy manager has been temporarily acting as manager.</p>
<p>Entrusted Public Notice of Temporary Suspension of Business:  Jiang Yiping, Lawyer, and Jiang Wanping, Accountant, Represent the World Commercial Savings Bank in Announcing the Temporary Suspension of Business:  "It is now stated by the Board of Directors of the World Commercial Savings Bank that due to the economic downturn and the severe credit crunch, the bank is temporarily unable to circulate funds.

In 1926, it was reorganized into a Chinese limited liability company, and all French shares were repurchased. In 1934, it applied to the Ministry of Finance to establish ordinary savings operations, with a capital of 450,000 national currency units. The head office was located in Beiping, and branch offices were established in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shantou, Tianjin, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Anqing, Changsha, and other places. Since the National Government promulgated the Savings Bank Law, which prohibited prize-linked savings, the Society immediately followed the instructions of the Ministry of Finance to terminate prize-linked savings and, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, transferred the depositors to ordinary savings.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Instruction: The Society received Qian Zi No. 10 from the Ministry of Finance, stating: "A document is submitted to the effect that, in order to comply with laws and regulations, the Savings Society is voluntarily terminating its savings operations and urgently needs cash for application purposes, and proposing solutions to be reviewed and instructed on.

The directors, supervisors, and managers of the Society can only be relieved of their responsibilities after the Trust Bureau has clarified the assets and liabilities and the assets are sufficient to offset the debts.

<p>Public Notice of Transfer: The Society's head office in Beiping and all branch offices temporarily suspended all collection and payment activities from yesterday to expedite the transfer. The Shanghai branch of the Society at 175 Guangdong Road in this city posted a public notice of temporary suspension of collection and payment at its entrance yesterday morning, stating: "This Society has recently received Order No. 10 from the Ministry of Finance, instructing that all assets and liabilities of Parts A and B of this Society be handed over to the Trust Bureau of the Central Bank for takeover.

It is reported that the Sino-French Savings Society temporarily suspended collection and payment activities to the public yesterday, but continued to work internally to expedite the closing of accounts in order to facilitate the transfer. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Chen Zhongsheng and others brought an official letter from the Trust Bureau of the Central Bank to the Sino-French Savings Society to conduct a formal takeover. It is estimated that the entire assets, etc., can be taken over completely today. After the Central Bank Trust Bureau completes its review, the business will revert to the Trust Bureau. It is understood that the Society has decided to transfer all assets and liabilities of the two types of savings to the Central Bank Trust Bureau and then proceed with the liquidation. After the Trust Bureau completes its review, the Central Bank Trust Bureau will take over, so depositors will not suffer any losses, and there will be no impact on Shanghai's financial market.</p>

The details are as follows:</p>
<p>President Wang's Treatment is Progressing Well: President Wang's old illness recurred, so he requested leave to come to Shanghai for diagnosis and treatment at the Noel Hospital. Mr. Wang is suffering from both diabetes and liver disease, and his bile ducts are blocked by stones, causing inflammation in the bile ducts. While I was in Beijing, I received a telegram from President Wang, stating that his fever had gradually subsided and that his treatment was progressing well. I expect that he will recover in the short term. I plan to visit him in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Kong Temporarily Replaces Wang in Political Affairs: During Mr. Jiang's leave, all affairs of the Executive Yuan will be temporarily handled by me. As for the affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vice Ministers Xu Tan and Tang Youren will be responsible for handling them under the supervision of President Wang. As for the 13th Standing Committee Meeting of the National Economic Committee and other committees, it was originally scheduled to be held in Beijing at the beginning of the month, but it has been postponed due to Mr. Wang's illness. Mr. Kong also said that the Chahar incident has been completely resolved.</p>
<p>Increased Prevention of Yangtze River Flooding: Mr. Kong continued, "Regarding the prevention of the rising water level of the Yangtze River, the government authorities are paying close attention to it due to the recent continuous heavy rains and the rising water level in various sections of the Yangtze River. For precautionary purposes, Fu Rulin, Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, and Mao Yisheng, Director of the Water Conservancy Department of the National Economic Committee, have been strictly ordered to supervise all technical personnel and the section chiefs of various sections of the Yangtze River to carry out prevention work, so as not to cause flooding. According to the observation of general hydrologists, although the water level of the Yangtze River is rising, if it is sunny and there is no rain in the coming days, the river water can recede and will not reach the shore."</p>

<h3 id="e128">Headquarters of the Aviation Association Calls Meeting of Hotel Industry Fundraisers <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Solicitation Team Headquarters of the Chinese Aviation Association started soliciting donations from the city's hotel industry based on 5% of their business income, the results have been excellent. However, some smaller hotels in categories C and D have not been diligent in their contributions. Therefore, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, a meeting of the Hotel Industry Fundraising Committee was convened on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to discuss the way forward. Attendees included Chuan Zhiyuan (Juelu Hotel), Chen Wenda (New World Hotel), Zhang Renliang (Wugong), Xu Wenzhao (Hongfu), Chen Yuanling (Nanjing), Cai Genyue (Ronghua), Zhu Linfeng (Zhongshan), Ren Heshan (Siming), Gao Weifu (Meng), Yang Yizhang (Xin Luming), Lu Youqiao (Zhongnan), Xi Rongpei (Da Hu), Yan Rongxiang (New Dongfang), Zhang Qiyuan (Da Zhonghua), Sun Qiuping, Zou Xieqing (Zhongzhou), Shi Xi (Dongfang), Wang Changgeng (Far East), Huang Renhe (Da Zhong), Shi Ming (Shenzhou), Li Jiemei (Da Shanghai), Yao Zhaoji (Chunjiang), Zhou Songxi, Yao Songnian, Gu Peiyuan, etc., as well as Li Dachao, Executive Director of the Team Headquarters; Zhang Yuliang, Chen Shuo, Zhu Shengyang, Lu Zhangyan, and Gu Shangrui, staff members; Chairman Li Dachao; and Recorder Chen Shuo. Chairman Li Dachao briefly reported that the hotel industry has been collecting donations according to business income since last year, thanks to the enthusiastic support and joint efforts of the industry association and various hotels, and the results have been very good. Even during the economic downturn, there has been monthly progress. The strength and spirit of the hotel industry are rare and commendable. The Team Leader expressed great pleasure and gratitude for the efforts of the hotel industry in this movement. The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss how to continue efforts in the future. After the fundraising began in the hotel industry, the effort by all the industry led to progress day by day. The average monthly revenue collected is around seven or eight thousand yuan. However, some smaller hotels in categories C and D have not been diligent in their contributions, and sometimes they collect and sometimes they stop. It is hoped that the fundraising committee will pay attention to this, and persuade them separately. As for category D hotels, if their business is indeed poor, they can follow alternative methods and make monthly donations. Even for small hotels, exemptions can be granted as appropriate to alleviate business difficulties. Furthermore, hotels that have not yet joined the industry association should be encouraged to join, so as to concentrate efforts, strengthen the organization, consolidate the foundation, and jointly seek the welfare of the industry. This office will do its best to assist, and so on. Subsequently, Chen Wenda, Gu Peiyuan, Gao Weifu, Sun Qiuping, Yao Songnian, and others from the hotel industry association spoke one after another, saying that they were very grateful for the Chairman's great remarks. Under the leadership of the China Aviation Association, the industry has worked hard to achieve today's results, and they are not complacent. In the future, they will be even more enthusiastic and work hard at all times to fulfill their national duties. As for the small number of hotels in categories C and D that are not diligent in collecting donations, they should be responsible for working with the China Aviation Association to send personnel to persuade them separately to collect seriously in order to fulfill their mission. Finally, the following matters were discussed: 1. Increase the promotion of solicitation: The Team Headquarters will list the collection status of each hotel and send it to the industry association for separate persuasion. 2. Assist the hotel industry association in expanding its solicitation of new members and strengthening the organization. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>

<p>Shen Fengming, from Chongming, was working as an informant for a Western detective at No. 26 Xuehuali Road, a property of the Public Works Department Company. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, at 12:00 PM, he went out shopping and encountered a bandit, Peng Yu Kui (27 years old, from Jiangbei), at the intersection of Kangti Road and Malong Road, who stopped him and falsely claimed, "I am Liu Ziqian, a detective from the police station. I am dispatched to inspect pedestrians." At that moment, Shen's friend, Zhu Hongqing, arrived. Peng pulled Shen into Lane 362, forcibly searched Shen's body, and robbed him of seven yuan and six jiao in cash. Shen realized that he had encountered a bandit and chased after him, blowing his whistle and shouting for thieves. A French Concession detective, Wu Lianrong, happened to pass by, heard the alarm, and caught up with Peng, recovered the stolen goods, and took him to the police station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. First, the police officer presented the case and requested a postponement to allow the police to investigate whether the defendant had committed other crimes.

<p>Yesterday's Reception for the Press</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Sports Garden at the intersection of West Sports Association Road is actively being arranged. Various ball fields, swimming pools, etc. have been completed one after another, and the opening will be held on the 10th of this month. Yesterday, the garden hosted the city's press for a tour, and business director Mr. Fang Lixiang and Mr. Zhang Yuliang reported. The internal equipment is detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Summer Resort</p>
<p>The Sports Garden is located at the intersection of West Sports Association Road, north of the Hongkou Swimming Pool. Public buses go directly to the entrance, making transportation very convenient. The garden covers dozens of acres, with lush grass and ancient trees. Based on its location, various ball games, entertainment, and places for banquets, dances, and rest are set up. Sitting in the breeze is truly a summer resort. The dance hall in the garden can accommodate hundreds of people and is the largest dance hall in Shanghai. The arrangement resembles a garden, with beautiful lighting. It is most suitable for daytime dancing. The cleanliness and deliciousness of its food and drink are all the more worthwhile.</p>
<p>Swimming Facilities</p>
<p>The swimming pool is located on the north side of the entrance. The area of the pool is smaller than the Hongkou Swimming Pool, but the sanitary equipment is more complete. There is also a medical room with eyewashers, sphygmomanometers, and various disinfectants for visitors to use. Two female nurses are hired to serve inside. Experts are also hired as instructors and coaches. Other facilities such as diving platforms, diving boards, slides, men's and women's changing rooms, shower rooms, storage rooms, and toilets are all very complete.</p>
<p>Various Entertainments</p>
<p>In terms of sports and entertainment, there are golf and hockey fields, ice skating, donkey riding, etc. Hockey is already a popular game in Europe and America. Although some Chinese people are familiar with this game, there has been no establishment of such a ball field. The garden's equipment is truly pioneering. There is also a maze, with a novel design that is captivating. Other new forms of entertainment are all original creations in China.</p>
<p>Purpose of Establishment</p>
<p>According to the person in charge, Mr. Sou, speaking to the reporter, the garden was originally the private garden of Mr. Zhou Suqun, a wealthy merchant from Guangdong. In view of the progress of construction in the city center and the relatively quiet market in the northern part of Shanghai, and the existing entertainment venues are all concentrated in the western part of Shanghai, in order to develop the market in this area, he specially opened the private garden and spent tens of thousands of yuan to set up various entertainments for the public to enjoy after work. After the opening, the entrance ticket will only cost four jiao, and with the ticket, one can enjoy one of the various entertainments in the garden with preferential treatment. The food and drink in the area are especially inexpensive and beautiful, and so on.</p>

<p>The pottery cargo ship Tao Jisheng recently loaded bricks and tiles in the interior and transported them to Yinxiang Port to unload. In order to make up for lost time, it was sailing day and night. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, it was sailing near the Liu River in the Southern Huangpu River. It was sailing fast with the wind. The Zhu Gendi ship, loaded with sugar and groceries from Shanghai to Jiahu, was also sailing with the wind. When the two ships saw each other, they both steered to avoid a collision. However, due to the strong wind and waves, they could not avoid it in time. The two ships collided violently. The Zhu ship was hit and retreated more than ten feet. The ship immediately capsized on the shore, and the people on board all fell into the water. The Tao ship was larger. There was a hole in the bow of the ship. Tao and his group also fell into the water at that time. The Tao ship's crew immediately lowered a sampan to rescue them. Tao and Zhu and their partners were rescued on the spot, but one crew member from each of the Tao and Zhu ships was missing. Zhu immediately hired a boat to try to right the ship. However, the sugar and groceries in the ship were all wet, and the bow of the ship was damaged. The two people came to Shanghai yesterday to report to the cargo owners and negotiate. Both sides have their own reasons and are unwilling to take responsibility. However, Zhu believes that the loss of the ship and cargo was great due to the collision and has detained the Tao ship, intending to sue for compensation for the loss.</p>

Wang Chongren, an officer of the bureau, questioned Lu Senlin, who stated that he was 31 years old, from Pudong, lived at No. 444 Gonghe Xin Road, and worked as a cook. Lu Tan was his legal wife and had fled eight years ago. Recently, she returned to his home and deceived his 12-year-old son, named Cai Bao, and hid him. He requested that Tan be ordered to live with him again, go back with him, and hand over Cai Bao. Lu Tan stated that she was 32 years old this year and had fled eight years ago because her husband beat her. Cai was indeed her biological son, but she did not know where he was at the moment. Today she came with her employer. Her employer lives at No. 16 Huanlong Road in the French Concession. Today she cannot go back with him. She has been helping in this employer's house for five years, so she wants to ask her employer to make the decision. Moreover, she has more than 200 yuan in debt that has not been cleared up, and so on. After reviewing the statements, the interrogating officer believed that the case concerned a marital dispute and that the sub-bureau was not in a position to handle it without authorization. Therefore, he ordered that they be sent to the Public Security Bureau for a decision.</p>

<p>Mr. Ma Shouyi, a famous Chinese magician, caused a sensation in Shanghai more than ten years ago with his excellent equipment and agile skills. At that time, in order to pursue perfection, Mr. Ma led his entire troupe of actors to perform in various countries in Europe, the West, and Southeast Asia. Wherever he went, tens of thousands of people flocked to watch. Whenever Mr. Ma took the stage, he always took it as his responsibility to promote party ideology and promote popular education. Therefore, people from all walks of life were happy to appreciate it. This time, he has returned from overseas with hundreds of the latest magic tricks. When the major theaters in Shanghai heard about it, they competed to invite him. Mr. Ma politely declined, agreeing to perform at the New Light Theater for three days starting tomorrow (the 6th). There are more than 40 programs, all of which are amazing, such as "Medical Examination of the Human Body", "Rapid Transformation", "Electric Escape", "Soul Transmigration", etc. In the Royal Theater in Paris, tickets were priced as high as twelve yuan. This performance will also feature the latest songs and dances by Mr. Ma's beloved daughters, Miss Jia Li and Miss Li Jun, and more than ten others, as well as Hai Rongfu and Peng Zuankui's "Light Body Technique", and many other exquisite programs, all of which are rarely seen by people in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Confirmation that Kidnapped Crew Members of Jiahe Wheel, Shen Qinxiang, etc. are Safe, China Merchants Bureau Has Received Telegram from Guangzhou Branch, But the Whereabouts of Accountant Li Xiaobin are Still Unknown <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Jiahe Wheel, which was hijacked by pirates in Dapeng Bay between Xiamen and Shantou on November 4 last year, and the three officers kidnapped, Shen Qinxiang, head of business; Ge Liangchen, accountant; and Li Xiaobin, etc. After the family representatives went to Hong Kong to negotiate in vain, Guangzhou police captured the Jiahe pirates in Huiyang on the 1st of this month, and rescued two hostages. Yesterday morning, a reporter from New Voice met Chen Weiqing, head of the general affairs department of the China Merchants Bureau. According to the discussion, the Guangzhou branch manager, Tang Yinghua, telegraphed that Shen Qinxiang and Ge Liangchen had been rescued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. Li Xiaobin's whereabouts are unknown. After the Public Security Bureau has completed the inquiry, the Guangzhou branch will release them on bail and they will return to Shanghai. The families of those who were kidnapped went to the China Merchants Bureau yesterday morning to inquire, and were very relieved after receiving accurate information. However, Li Xiaobin's wife is very worried.</p>

<p>A Hangzhou woman named A Feng, real name Fu Zhen, 18 years old, lived with only her elderly mother. Due to difficult living conditions, she was introduced to work as hostess number 67 in the rooftop garden of the New New Company on Nanjing Road. She was usually very lively, so her colleagues got along well with her. She was also naturally charming and innocent, like a young woman who had not experienced much of the world. However, for some unknown reason, this fragile girl suddenly became pessimistic and conceived a desire to end her life. At around 8:40 PM last night, when tourists were bustling about, A Feng suddenly ran to the balcony of the rooftop garden near the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road, climbed over the cement railing, stepped over the iron fence, and threw herself down to the street below, committing suicide. At the time, no one noticed, so it went undetected. It was only when a patrolman at the street intersection saw her that an alarm was raised. He rushed forward to check and found that her head, feet, hands, and other parts of her body were all seriously injured. She barely had any breath left, so he urgently reported to the Old Zha gate police station, which rushed her to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of her injuries, she died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Her body has been sent to the morgue for examination. Her name and address could not be immediately determined because the garden's tea sales were not directly managed by the company but were contracted out to a man named Shen Changgeng. As for the reason for her suicide, her colleagues said it was probably due to the pressure of making a living, or perhaps it was due to romantic love or family misfortune. They are currently searching for her family to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Shanghai Ferry Company: Complete Sale of Property, Eight Company Motorboats Sold for 24,000 Yuan, Contract Signed on the 1st <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Ferry Company sold all of its assets and business rights to Song Wenkui, who was previously employed by the British company Moutai Yanghang on Hankou Road, on the first of this month. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Eight Motorboats: The company has been established for more than three years and is a joint-stock venture. The general manager is Mr. Gu Fujiang, and the office is located at No. 244 Zhonghui Building. The business office is located at the floating pier on Jiujiang Road. There are a total of eight small motorboats (two of which are mortgaged to the company by the American company Shishi He Yanghang).</p>
<p>Complete Sale: The motorboats are temporarily rented to shipping companies to transport passengers to and from Shanghai-bound foreign ships berthed at the floating docks on the Huangpu River, which is a major part of the business. Due to the impact of the widespread economic downturn, the business has been poor, so the shareholders decided to sell all of the company's assets and business rights.</p>
<p>Contract Signed: The buyer of all the company's assets is Mr. Song Wenkui, who previously worked for the British company Moutai Yanghang (specializing in transshipment business) on Hankou Road (his position was equivalent to that of a Chinese manager). The selling price is 24,000 yuan. The contract was signed by both parties on July 1 at the law firm of Xu Shihao at No. 33 Sichuan Road, and the buyer paid the seller 8,000 yuan in advance. The remaining amount will be paid in full after one month.</p>
<p>Foreign Company Dominance: According to statistics, there are four companies operating ferry services in Shanghai. In addition to the Shanghai Ferry Company, which sold its property rights this time and is wholly Chinese-owned, the other three are American company Shishi He, Huangpu (British company Moutai Yanghang), and Tingmao (also British). Therefore, the complete sale of Shanghai Ferry Company's property rights is deeply regrettable to outsiders.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Diao Fengchun, Body Tattooed with Flower Dragon, Also Tattooed with "Thirteenth Brother of Baishuitan", Diao Arrested for Cutting and Wounding Causing Death <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yan Ronghai, a native of Zhenjiang, residing at No. 13, Qiujiazhai, Dongjiadu, Pudong, 29 years old this year, stayed overnight at No. 15 Jinling Hotel, Taiyuanfang, Caishi Street, French Concession, the day before yesterday. On the morning of the 2nd, at 3:00 AM, Yan left the hotel to have some refreshments. As soon as he arrived at the entrance of Taiyuanfang Alley, six strangers suddenly appeared, each wielding a sharp axe. Without asking any questions, they slashed at Yan's body, inflicting more than ten axe wounds on his left hand and more than ten axe wounds on his left leg. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The murderers fled in a panic. Later, when the police arrived, they took Yan to the police station and sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Although his injuries were serious, they were not life-threatening. Later, Detective Cui Zhenguo of the police station discovered that the murderer was hiding in Room 12 of the Chunxi Hotel on Beihai Road in the Public Concession. He immediately joined forces with the police of the Public Concession and arrested Diao Chunfeng, seizing an iron rod. He was taken back to the police station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The police lawyer stated the case, saying that the police station still needed to arrest accomplices and requested an extension of the interrogation. The defendant, Diao Chunfeng, denied the assault. Detective Cui Zhenguo then testified that the defendant had no occupation and had a tattooed flower dragon on his body, with the dragon's head on his chest, circling his body and arms. The official ordered Diao to take off his clothes for inspection. The defendant did indeed have a tattooed flower dragon on his body. Next to the dragon's head on his chest was a likeness of the character "Thirteenth Brother" from the old drama *Baishuitan*, which looked quite heroic. After the court verified the confession, Judge Sun Pengxian ordered a postponement to the 18th of this month for further trial. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>The Criminal Investigation Team of the Xinzha Branch previously broke up a gang of thieves consisting of Chen Weibao, Ma Liming, Wu Qikun, Feng Shoushan, and Ji Xueke while checking pedestrians on Guoliao Road. A handgun was found on Chen Weibao, and so on. This was reported in the newspapers. It is now known that in the past two days, Police Officer Luo Siwei of the Wuzhen Road Police Station led detectives Zhong Da, Mao Gongzhao, Zang Ding, and Zhou Deming to successively capture five more thieves and suspects on Liuying Road, Pushan Road, Jinling Road, and Guangfu Road. All of them confessed during interrogation. Therefore, together with Chen Weibao and the others, a total of ten people were escorted to the Public Security Bureau yesterday morning. The names, ages, and hometowns of the thieves are listed below: Chou Guangcheng, 37 years old; Guan Jinao, 22 years old. The above two were arrested in a shed on Liuying Road. Wang Dazhong, 37 years old, was arrested in a shed near the Yangzhou Guild Hall on Pushan Road. Wang Kaiyu, 49 years old, was arrested in a shed on Jinling Road. Meng Xinshan, 32 years old, was arrested on a boat across from Deshunli on Guangfu Road. The above five are all from Funing.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Impersonating Fire Brigade Officer, Repeatedly Extorting, Chen Zhaoshun, Defying the Law, Arrested and Sentenced to Await Trial <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zhaoshun, a native of Shaoxing residing at No. 90 Guishi Lane, Tiantong Road, North Fujian Road, impersonated a representative of the Public Works Department Fire Brigade on October 15th of last year. He broke into a coppersmith shop at No. 100 Pike Road, claiming that the loft built by the shop had not been approved by the Fire Brigade and was illegal. He extorted twenty yuan. The shop's treasurer, Mr. Zhang, negotiated with him, and they settled for fifteen yuan. However, Zhang was suspicious afterward because Chen did not look like a fireman. He sent his apprentices, Ding Zhiming and Xu Changhai, to follow and investigate, but they soon lost track of him. They then went to the Xinzha Fire Brigade to inquire, but there was no one named Chen Zhaoshun. Only then did they realize they had been deceived. However, because they did not know Chen's address, they could not investigate. Until 3:15 PM the day before yesterday, Chen used the same trick again, impersonating a Fire Brigade member from No. 288, to extort from Ji Zhaorong, the owner of the Yongxingtai Hotel at No. 88 Pike Road. He was seen by Ding and Xu, the apprentices from the nearby coppersmith shop, who knew that Chen had extorted fifteen yuan from their shop last year. They reported to Chinese Constable No. 2914, who arrested Chen Zhaoshun and detained him at the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police filed charges of extortion under Article 346, Section 1 of the Criminal Code. The police lawyer, Qian Goujiu, stated the case, saying that the defendant denied extortion at the police station, claiming that he was a detective stationed in Shanghai by the Public Security Bureau of Yuyao County, Shaoxing. Yesterday, he went to No. 88 Pike Road to investigate a case. However, the police have now found that the defendant had been arrested and punished four times for fraud and gambling offenses. Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the trial to investigate whether the defendant was a public servant. The witnesses, Ding Zhiming and Xu Changhai, testified about the circumstances of the defendant impersonating a Fire Brigade member and extorting fifteen yuan from their shop on October 15th of last year. Ji Zhaorong, the owner of the Yongxingtai Hotel, also reported that the defendant arrived yesterday afternoon, claiming that the loft built in his shop was illegal and that the workers had to demolish it. However, if he could buy cigars and alcohol, he could intercede with the foreigners. He refused. While they were arguing, Ding and Xu, the two apprentices from the coppersmith shop next door, arrived, saying that the defendant had extorted fifteen yuan from their shop last year, so they immediately called the police to arrest him. The defendant, Chen Zhaoshun, claimed that he was a detective stationed in Shanghai by the Public Security Bureau of Yuyao. He came to the hotel yesterday to investigate a theft case after receiving a letter from Yuyao instructing him to investigate the case with another detective, Chen Xizhou. He was falsely accused of extortion. He also hired lawyer Chen Maoxuan to defend him and requested bail. Judge Yang Shengxin ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and postponed the trial for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Cause of Death of Boy in Xiaobang Lane: Three Scavenging Children Robbed Silver Necklace, Little Dog Lost His Life in Vain <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the body of a 14-year-old boy, Su Xiaogouzi, was found in Xiaobang Lane, Wangdao Port, Gaochang Temple, South Shanghai. He had been murdered and had knife wounds on his head. He was rescued by the police, sent to Shanghai Hospital, and died after ineffective treatment. It is now known that the deceased, Su Xiaogouzi, was 14 years old, a native of Xinghua, Jiangbei. He usually carried a bamboo basket to scavenge for scraps. Because his parents loved him, he had worn a silver necklace (worth about three yuan) since he was a child. The day before yesterday (the 2nd), after finishing his meal at home, Xiaogouzi carried his basket out as usual. Unexpectedly, he met with this tragedy. According to people, the cause of the tragedy was greed for money. Three other scavengers, older than the deceased, ganged up on him to snatch the silver necklace from Xiaogouzi's neck. Xiaogouzi refused to let go and resisted. However, he was no match for the gang, and they forcibly snatched it and tried to escape. Xiaogouzi cried and shouted, "I know you! I won't let you get away with this!" When the bad kids heard this, they feared the consequences and, without considering the consequences, immediately turned back, pulled out sharp blades, and slashed wildly at Xiaogouzi's head. Then, they used ropes to tighten around Xiaogouzi's neck. Finally, they dragged Xiaogouzi to a small river and drowned him in the mud. The stories vary, and no one knows for sure. Then, the police discovered that Xiaogouzi had not completely died, so they tried to rescue him and rushed him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The boy's mother, Su Chen, heard the news and rushed to the hospital. She confirmed that it was her son. Unfortunately, Xiaogouzi was seriously injured and could not speak. He only used gestures to describe how he was robbed of his necklace by the children. Yesterday morning, Zhang Hongxun, the local headman, reported the case to the local court and requested an autopsy. In the afternoon, Commissioner Lei Binzhang and Inspector Yi Zhiming arrived at the court. The autopsy revealed that the deceased Su Xiaogouzi had three knife wounds on the back of his head, his skull had been shattered, and there was a knife wound in his right eye socket, penetrating deep into the brain. There were also marks on his neck from being strangled. It was confirmed that he died from his injuries. The death certificate was filled out, and the family was instructed to prepare a coffin and wait for the arrest and punishment of the murderers. It is astonishing that a mere silver necklace could cost someone their life. No wonder glittering gold attracts so much attention and can lead to death.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Yulin Road Police Station Intercepts Nine Robbers, Confiscates Real and Fake Handguns, Commits Crimes in the French Concession <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Pan Yunlong, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, and Chinese Constable No. 3222, discovered that thieves were hiding at No. 22, Xinhua Lane, No. 1296 Pingliang Road, and plotted to rob a cigarette and paper store on Meizhou Road the night before last at 6:00 PM. They then cooperated with Chinese and Western detectives to secretly arrest nine people at the address: Liu Yikuan and Ai Qinggui from Anhui, Jiang Shixiang from Jiangbei, and women Cai Xiuying, Zhou Cai, Sun Cai, Liu Sheng, Ai Wu, and Yang Xiuzhen. A real and a fake handgun and a gold bracelet were confiscated and taken to the police station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated the previous situation, saying that these people were found to be staying in the French Concession, living as outlaws. The gold bracelet found was robbed from the home of Qi Zhang, a resident of No. 4, Lane 39, Kangti Road, French Concession, on the morning of the 2nd of this month at 9:30 AM. Before escaping, she threatened that she could not report to the police. She was too afraid to report. When the police detectives went to arrest them, the defendant Cai Xiuying was about to hide the real and fake guns and the gold bracelet in a box and under the bed when she was discovered. Qi Zhang has identified the gold bracelet as the original stolen item. The French police have already arrested two robbers in the case, Chen Jinyou (the defendant Yang Xiuzhen's lover) and Liu Yide. The Second Special Court is interrogating them. The defendants Zhou Cai, Liu Yikuan, and Yang Xiuzhen previously lived in the French Concession (Kangti Road, Fuli Lane, etc.) and recently moved to the cigarette and paper store on Meizhou Road in the Public Concession. The defendant Jiang Shixiang was the "dragon head," ordering them to rob. He requested a postponement of the case for detailed investigation. Detective Pan Yi then reported the process of solving the case and presented the handgun and gold bracelet for inspection. Judge Wu Zehan questioned each of the defendants and ordered them to be returned to custody separately for further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Announces the Recovery of the Dateli Wharf <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has been planning to take over the Dateli Company for a long time. Recently, both parties reached an agreement. The bureau sent personnel to take over. The process is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Implement Reorganization Plan: Except for the Dateli Company Wharf, all private wharves in the South Shanghai Wharf area have been taken back by the city in accordance with the reorganization plan. In November 1933, in order to implement the wharf reorganization plan and reorganize the traffic on the outer roads, the Public Utilities Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Land Bureau decided to take back the company's private wharf.</p>
<p>Decide on Recovery Method: After the company's private wharf is taken back, it will be reorganized and rented to the company or other companies by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to increase the city's revenue and improve the city's appearance. This decision was approved by the bureau and filed with the municipal government.</p>
<p>Estimate Wharf Assets: The price of the wharf was jointly determined by the Public Utilities Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and experts, and discussed and decided with the company. The floating wharf, floating bridge, cement part, and the area occupied by the sheds were estimated to be worth 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Handle Takeover Procedures: After the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the company reached an agreement on all takeover procedures, on June 24th, the bureau dispatched Secretary Kong Huai and Technical Officer Li Yongqing to the company to take over the wharf assets and its ancillary buildings. The wharf price of 30,000 yuan was also paid to the company by the bureau. In addition, the company paid 1,000 yuan for outstanding dredging fees, line fees, and 1,357 yuan and 2 jiao for beach and public land rent.</p>
<p>Continue to Rent the Wharf: After the Dateli Wharf was taken back, the company requested to rent it. The amount of the wharf rental fee and deposit has been negotiated between the company and the bureau. A wharf rental contract was signed on June 24th, and the rental began on that day. All procedures have been completed by the bureau and reported to the municipal government for filing.</p>
<p>Implement Reorganization Work: The houses attached to the wharf protrude into the embankment line and occupy the road surface of the outer roads, which greatly hinders vehicle traffic. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the Public Works Bureau previously planned to draw a straight line from the garbage wharf to the Dangguan Wharf, which would be the embankment line. All sheds within the embankment line will be demolished. Now that the takeover of the Dateli Wharf has been completed, the sheds within the embankment of the Dateli Wharf, together with the Minnan Wharf, will be demolished. The road surface will be widened, and the embankment line between the Dateli and Minnan wharves will be extended outward.</p>

<p>Lawyer Wang Xianggu, a taxpayer in the Public Concession, wrote to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday, saying: "I am writing to inform you that the taxpayer was cut off his phone line due to the Public Works Department's tax collection office overcharging general tax. I sent two letters to your association, requesting that you forward them to the department to immediately restore the phone service and compensate for all losses, and so on. Since the second letter was sent, more than a year has passed, and the department has not replied. Instead, it filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai First Special District Local Court last autumn to recover the tax. The taxpayer believed that the department's illegal phone cut-off affected the legal interests of the entire citizenry of the concession. To maintain the taxpayer's position, he filed a counterclaim, demanding compensation for damages. The department argued in the litigation process that the counterclaim could not be filed. The judge in the first instance ruled in favor of the department. The taxpayer, based on the interpretation of the former Supreme Court's Tong Zi No. 97, argued that although the plaintiff was not subject to our country's jurisdiction under the treaty, it should not be treated as an ordinary defendant in the case of a counterclaim. He filed an appeal. After several court hearings, the department was willing to waive the tax and offset the losses, withdrawing the original lawsuit. The taxpayer also withdrew the appeal. The two parties jointly petitioned the court to dismiss the case, and the court issued a notice approving it yesterday. The taxpayer is grateful that the resolution of this phone cut-off incident is largely due to the department's willingness to admit its mistakes. But it cannot be separated from the efforts of your association to uphold justice, support the citizens, and be worthy of the voice of the taxpayers of the concession. It is hoped that the department will administer according to the law from now on, demonstrating that it is the only municipal organization that embodies the spirit of the rule of law. Work together with your association, which represents the public opinion, to benefit not only the taxpayers but also the citizens of the concession. Because the incident has come to an end, I am writing to inform you of the process and thank your association, and I ask that you close the case. Yours sincerely, Wang Xianggu, taxpayer of the Shanghai Concession."</p>
<h3 id="e150">He Fu Petitions the American Court to Order Raven to Return the Gift Money, Xie Fuzi, Manager of the American Eastern Bank, Returns to Shanghai <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The *China Press* reported that yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon, Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of the American Feng Bank and three other companies, petitioned the American Court in China again, ordering Mr. Raven to return 135,000 taels of silver that the American Eastern Bank and the Puyi Real Estate Company had each given him in 1932, plus interest at 6% per annum from the date of receipt to the date of return. He Fu claimed that the board of directors of the two companies passed resolutions to grant the silver that were worded the same as those passed by the board of directors of the American Feng Bank, saying that Mr. Raven had served faithfully for a long time without receiving any salary or other remuneration. It is now found that Mr. Raven was paid a monthly salary of 2,000 yuan for some time before the board of directors of Puyi Real Estate Company passed the resolution, and he continued to receive it after the resolution was passed. Therefore, his acceptance of the gift was improper and deceptive. The resolutions passed by the two companies stipulated that the gift would be written off in the books over six years. Judging from the situation, Raven must have known that the company was empty and on the verge of bankruptcy at the time. The two newly filed cases do not require Raven to increase the security deposit, because the bond guaranteed by the American Feng Bank case is sufficient to prevent him from leaving China. These three cases will not be heard in one or two weeks, because Mr. Hillmiche, the chief judge of the American Court, is currently handling cases in North China and cannot return to Shanghai for a while. He Fu also mentioned yesterday the liquidation of the Tianjin branch of the American Feng Bank, saying that he had received some money from the branch's fraud. If all the outstanding money can be recovered, it is hoped that half of the depositors' money can be returned. It would be too extravagant to hope for a full return. As for the liquidation of the Hong Kong branch of the American Eastern Bank, it should naturally be handled by the American court. The same is true for the company in Manila. Therefore, he cannot interfere with the affairs of the Shanghai liquidation office. He is very busy now. Although today is American Memorial Day, he will still be working as usual. The bank's supplies, such as electric fans and typewriters, are now being sold cheaply to raise more cash. The *Continental Daily News* reported that Mr. Xie Fuzi, the former manager of the American Eastern Bank, took leave to return to the United States at the beginning of this year. He set off to return to China last month and arrived in Shanghai the night before last. While in the United States, he had not heard that the company had gone bankrupt. When he happily returned to the company yesterday morning, he found that it was closed for liquidation. He was greatly dismayed. He told people that if he had known that the company had closed, he would not have returned to Shanghai in such a hurry.</p>

<p>Among domestic light bulbs, the Appler brand is often the oldest and largest. The light bulbs produced are also the most energy-saving, durable, and have accurate lighting. Now, after testing by the Research Institute of National Jiaotong University, Report No. 105 states that the Appler light bulb has the following advantages: (1) After 12 light bulbs were continuously powered for 1,000 hours, the filaments were not damaged, and the candlepower did not drop below 80%. (2) The power consumption rate of light bulbs with the same standard code is very uniform. (3) The power consumption rate per candlepower and the number of lumens per watt meet the standards. (4) The degree of candlepower reduction after continuous power for 1,000 hours also meets the standards. Therefore, users in various places have recently been sending letters and telegrams to order, and although they have been jealous and slandered by the industry, they can now produce in large quantities.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Record of the Opening Trial of the Lu Guixing Murder Case: Complex Situation Still Requires Investigation; Defendants Remanded for Further Questioning <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Lu Guixing, a 45-year-old man from Anhui, lived in the Triangle Street of the South City. He had previously served as a detective for the Public Security Bureau. After being dismissed from his position in June of last year, he had been unemployed at home. In the spring of this year, Lu's apprentice, Chen Liaotou, and Fan Guangyu, Gao Yusheng, Shu Jinbao, etc., had a conflict due to contracting the shoulder-carrying of foreign pine work for the Renhe Lumber Company. As a result, Lu intervened and mediated, and the matter was settled. On June 4th (i.e., the fourth day of the fifth lunar month), Fan Guangyu invited Chen Liaotou to Lu Jiabang's No. 1 Teahouse to settle the remaining profits. Chen Liaotou then accompanied Lu Guixing to the teahouse at 2 PM to negotiate. However, they disagreed and started fighting. As a result, Lu Guixing was stabbed to death. His wife, Lu Li, sued in court, and the local court sent personnel to verify the coffin and burial. Meanwhile, the police successively arrested the murderers Li Guitian, Fan Guangyu (who was also cut in the left arm), Shu Sanbao, and others, and detained them for investigation. It is now known that this case has been thoroughly investigated by Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, who has prosecuted the case in the criminal court for causing death by injury. At 10 AM yesterday, Judge Shao Qinzhi specially opened the Third Tribunal to hear the case. First, the deceased's wife, Lu Li, testified, stating that she was 42 years old and that her husband, Lu Guixing, was stabbed to death by Li Guitian and others. She demanded justice. Next, Chen Liaotou testified, stating that he was 40 years old and from Gaoyou. On the fourth day of the fifth lunar month, he and Lu Guixing sent wages to the teahouse, but Fan Guangyu and others, without asking the reason, attacked them with stools. Seeing that the situation was not good, he ran away to avoid danger. Fan Guangyu testified that he was 44 years old and from Shandong, working as a foreman at the Renhe Lumber Company. He, Chen Liaotou, Lu Guixing, and others signed a contract, stipulating that if they earned 100 yuan, Lu Guixing wanted to deduct 20 yuan. On that day, Lu Guixing and others had ambushed many thugs and forcibly deducted the 20 yuan remuneration. He and others refused to accept this, which led to a fight. In desperation, he resisted with a stool. His arm was injured by Chen Liaotou with an iron rod. As for how Lu Guixing died, he did not know and asked for investigation. Li Guitian testified that he was 39 years old and from Shandong, working as a small laborer. His testimony was the same as Fan Guangyu's. Shu Sanbao testified that he was 28 years old and from Xinghua, Jiangbei. On the morning of the fourth day of the fifth lunar month, he went to Tangqiao for something and did not return home until 4 PM. Lu Guixing's apprentice came to his house and said that "Three Companies" (referring to the contract signed by the three of them) had killed someone and asked him to pay 400 yuan for funeral expenses. He believed that this share was handled by his brother, Shu Jinbao, and had nothing to do with him. He refused to pay, so he was arrested late at night and asked for investigation. The judge, after hearing the testimony, believed that the case was complex and still needed investigation. Therefore, he ordered all defendants to be remanded. Chen Liaotou was still released on bail to await further trial.</p>

<h3 id="e157">General Situation of the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The manufacture of condensed milk was invented by Mr. Borden in the United States as early as 1856. However, its manufacture in Switzerland was pioneered by Mr. Page, who was the American Consul to Switzerland at that time. On August 6, 1866, he founded the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company in Switzerland, with a capital of 100,000 francs. This was gradually increased to over 20 million francs, and factories were established in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States, and other places.</p>
<p>The Nestlé Milk Powder Factory was founded in 1875 in Vevey, Switzerland, for the purpose of taking over the milk powder workshop established by the chemist Henri Nestlé. From 1878 onwards, this company also manufactured Nestlé brand condensed milk. The company progressed very rapidly, and soon its activities expanded to foreign countries such as Spain, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The initial capital of the company was 1 million francs, which was increased to 2 million francs in 1881. In 1904, the company entered into a contract with the Swiss Chocolate Factory to manufacture Nestlé brand milk chocolate, and invested 1 million francs in that company, thus increasing its capital from 2.5 million francs to 3.5 million francs. At the same time, the company also became the sole agent for the export of all brands of chocolate produced by that factory in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The current Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company was formed in 1905 by the merger of the Nestlé Factory and the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company. Since then, its business has flourished. New factories have been established in various important producing countries. Today, the company's business has spread all over the world. On the one hand, sales offices have been established, and on the other hand, many independent companies have been entrusted with managing sales. The company's capital increased to 160 million francs after the merger in 1905. After the European War, the world economy declined greatly, and the company was also affected, suffering heavy losses. Therefore, it had to reduce its capital to 80 million francs. After this reorganization, the company's products were well-known, and it was able to develop greatly in the following years. In 1929, the company also acquired the Peter-Cailler-Kohler Swiss Chocolate Factory. This merger was based on a stock exchange calculation, i.e., each share of Anglo-Swiss Company stock worth 200 was exchanged for four shares of the above-mentioned company, each worth 100 . As a result, the company's capital increased by 17.5 million to 97.5 million francs, and the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company became the world's largest manufacturer of condensed milk and chocolate. This development has increased, and its activities have also expanded to other products, such as milk powder and etc. Currently, the company has 6,000 employees and 17,000 workers. The board of directors has twelve members in Switzerland, with Mr. Davel as the chairman.</p>

<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao: I recently read the "Local News" column of Shen Bao, which mentioned the suicide by drowning of Wang Zhaochang. It was said that he was an employee of the ginseng and swallow's nest department of Wing On Company. We have checked and there is no such person as Wang Zhaochang in our ginseng and swallow's nest department, nor is there anyone with this name in the entire company. It is obviously a false rumor. Please correct it tomorrow to avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, Wing On Company, July 4th.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Reporter: I recently read the newspaper report by the reporters of Shenshi News Agency regarding my inquiry about the financial situation, saying that the crisis is very deep and will inevitably collapse, which is not true. I am afraid it will cause misunderstandings in all walks of life, so I solemnly declare as follows: The reporter of the news agency came to the meeting yesterday afternoon to ask me how the financial situation was after the bank's half-year closing. I said, "It has gradually become stable, but if the fundamental solution is found, the future development will be more promising." At that time, there were many guests, and only these few words were discussed. I hope it will be included in the "Letters to the Editor" column to correct it. Sincerely, Lin Kanghou, July 4th.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Special Feature: Liu Haisu Reports on His European Tour (6) <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>This exhibition of modern Chinese paintings and large-scale works from various countries is not only a powerful cultural dissemination in our country but also an important contribution to the Western academic community. It has also aroused the interest of young scholars from various countries in studying Chinese painting. For example, Dr. Contag from Germany and Ms. Sebeke from England have already visited China. The Bali Art Museum in Berlin has opened a hall dedicated to modern Chinese paintings. All these things have created a new record in the history of international culture. The benefits gained are also worth mentioning, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Changing the Previous Misconceptions of European Scholars: Oriental scholars and art historians in various European countries consistently praise the value of ancient Chinese art in their writings. However, they believe that there is no art to speak of in China after the Yuan and Ming dynasties. This preconceived notion holds that the splendid and beautiful art of ancient China has become a thing of the past. In addition, the government of our Eastern neighbor has repeatedly allocated huge sums of money in recent years to vigorously promote its modern art, seemingly claiming the highest position in the East. Therefore, Europeans generally regard China as a thing of the past. Regarding modern Eastern art, they only know Japan and do not know China. This has even created the fallacy that China has no modern culture. The exhibition of modern paintings in various countries has given scholars from various countries a deep interest in research and provided people from various countries with an opportunity for universal contact. It has changed the previous misconceptions of various countries and made them deeply believe that Chinese art is constantly progressing. They admire and learn from it. Such discussions have been published in newspapers in various countries. Here are a few excerpts: On May 16, 1934, the German "East and Wheel Report" published a lengthy article reviewing the Chinese modern painting exhibition, which included a passage saying, "We used to say that Chinese painting is nothing more than a weak review of ancient masterpieces, and that ancient paintings are far-sighted and insightful. How frivolous and superficial is this view! Naturally, even with the paintings of famous modern Chinese painters such as Liu Haisu, Qi Baishi, Ren Bonian, and Wu Changshuo, it is not enough to surpass the masterpieces of the Song and Yuan dynasties, just like the works of modern German masters compared to Dufort Holdim or Gounwald. Here, we can't say which is higher or lower, but we must pay attention to the differences, because the creative goals of today's Chinese painters are different from those of the past, and they have new tendencies and new expressions. This can only be discovered by studying carefully, but I am not only talking about its influence by Europe. Soon, the European art scene will be influenced by it..." In addition, the British art authority, Binyon, also said in the preface to our book exhibition, "European and Western collectors and connoisseurs all love ancient and rare objects, so there are many barriers to modern Chinese art. They all believe that this art, which has been passed down for two thousand years, has become a thing of the past. Today, thanks to the efforts of artists, it is confirmed that Chinese painting has been revived, and it is not only continuing its long history, but also able to break free from the old Chinese style and absorb the essence of European and Western famous paintings. Mr. Liu Haisu once came to Europe and the West to study art, and he has a deep understanding of Chinese ink painting and Western oil painting techniques. He is proficient in using them freely and can be compared with modern European masters. This time, he brought paintings to Europe for exhibition. His personal masterpieces are magnificent and elegant, and they are truly extraordinary, which is especially admirable. The masterpieces in the exhibition, whose style and themes are in line with Chinese customs and can open up new paths, Western superficial views often regard innovation as creation, while Chinese writers do not all follow the ancients, because the rebirth of art lies in the great personality of the artist, renewing his vision and soul, and revitalizing customs, has completed his mission..." Lourence Binyon is a British master of literary criticism who has studied Chinese art for forty years and has written books such as "Painting of the East" and "History of Chinese Art". He once said that Chinese art had declined after the Yuan and Ming dynasties, but now he has changed his tune. (To be continued)</p>

<p>A man sitting in a rickshaw can only accommodate up to two people, but a woman sitting in a rickshaw can sometimes pile up to three, which shows that urban women are indeed light-boned.</p>
<p>In the hearse, you can often see a few pretty smiling faces with rouge and powder.</p>
<p>The most unsightly thing on a person is the face of a gentleman and the feet of a Jiangbei grandma.</p>
<p>From a husband's clothes, you can see the diligence or laziness of his wife.</p>
<p>Youth is like the green grass of spring, adulthood is like the peony of March; old age is the remnant chrysanthemum of autumn; and old age is the withered leaves waiting to fall.</p>

<p>— Hu Tianyu</p>
<p>I feel the deepest weariness for drifting.</p>
<p>I need rest now. I think, as long as there are three rooms and a courtyard; one room as a study, one as a bedroom, and one as a guest room; in the courtyard, I can plant some favorite flowers and plants, and place some exquisite bonsai. Every day, I go from the bedroom to the study, and from the study to the courtyard. When friends come, I can sit with him in the guest room and talk. In this peaceful and elegant environment, I will become a happy person. My lifelong hope is this, and when will this be realized? Alas!</p>
<p>I am tired, yes, really tired. But what is the use of being tired?</p>
<p>In the blue sky, the birds circling, looking for food, flying all day, making it feel unbearably tired, but before it has filled its stomach, it has no way to settle comfortably in the nest in the woods.</p>
<p>This suggests that my weariness can only be endured and cannot rest in my ideal comfortable nest.</p>
<p>I heard the girl's delicate voice singing: "You have been busy for many years, until today... You are too tired, you should rest!... My Darling! Don't move, don't move, rest for five minutes"! However, I can't even rest for five minutes, even though I am so tired!</p>
<p>Say less! Tomorrow, tomorrow I will continue my drifting!</p>
<h3 id="e176">Song and Dance in Southeast Asia <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Intention</p>
<p>Although Chinese song and dance have not completely left the stage of immaturity, there has been significant progress from children's opera to adult song and dance, and from fairy tale materials to realistic plots.</p>
<p>The year before last, the Meihua Troupe performed song and dance dramas such as "Love School" in the Nanyang Islands, with a total business income of more than 300,000 shields (equivalent to more than 600,000 Chinese currency), which aroused the song and dance fever of the Nanyang masses. Therefore, domestic song and dance troupes have unanimously invested in Nanyang. Currently, the Meihua, Qiangwei, Wanhua, and Sanban troupes have arrived in Nanyang, and the Yinhua, Hudie, and Lihua troupes are on the way. Therefore, the domestic song and dance news is silent. Now, I will briefly report on the recent situation of the three major groups that have performed in various parts of Nanyang to those who care about song and dance.</p>
<p>Meihua: Departed last November, via Singapore, Siam, and the Malay Peninsula, and is now performing in Penang. The main characters are Zhang Xianlin, Cai Yiming, Xu Canying, Fan Lixiang, etc. The main programs are "A Spring Dream" and "Playing". It has a strong appeal and is enthusiastically welcomed everywhere. In Siam, the business income in one day was more than 5,000 shields, and the actors were paid five times their salary, breaking the Meihua Troupe's all-time box office record. The grand occasion can be imagined.</p>
<p>Qiangwei: Departed this February, via Hong Kong, Kowloon, Annam Di'an, and Siam, and is now performing in Singapore. It has the Pan sisters, Wenxia and Wenjuan, who once caused a sensation in Nanyang, as its pillars. Its appeal is also quite strong. In Annam Di'an, the box office was undiminished for a month, which was due to the Pan sisters' beauty and art. The main programs are "A Spring Dream" and "Transformation", etc. Pan Wenjuan's "Red Dance" and "Toe Dance" were also very popular for a while.</p>
<p>Wanhua: Departed this March, via Singapore, Malay, and Sahara, and is now in Saigon, Annam. The female actors are quite complete, with 16 people including Zhang Lijuan and Li Meimei, but it is calling with no famous character, its business income is inferior to Meihua and Qiangwei.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Record of the Orchid of the Valley <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yuan</p>
<p>The orchids in the empty valley always emit a strange fragrance, which is a blessing unique to the disciples of Yufu. Urban people cannot enjoy it, and even if they are occasionally moved to a crowd, they do not make a startling sound or offer a flattering look. However, if people approach them, they will naturally feel happy. Isn't art the same? I once went to Songjiang and visited the New Songjiang Society. The Songfeng Painting and Calligraphy Society happened to gather there. The gentlemen expressed their aspirations and entrusted their lofty feelings to painting and calligraphy. The dazzling array of treasures made me sigh that they were enough to make Yufu proud in this world. And recently, this society suddenly quietly exhibited its superb structures in the northern commercial market of the New World. The viewers rubbed shoulders and stepped on each other's heels. Is this also the orchid of the valley, not seeking to be known by others, but people come to it themselves? During my spare time, I often linger and admire it. I write down a glimpse to tell those who have not seen it, and to confirm it with those who have already seen it.</p>
<p>The landscapes of Fei Longding, Zhang Shutong, Zhuocheng brothers, Wang Shilin, and Min Ruizhi are full of spirit and harmony, and they look like old hands. Young painters such as Yu Xiaolian's landscapes are elegant, ancient, and can be called the authentic school of Songjiang. The ladies also got the essence of Yuhu, which is impossible without a solid foundation in learning. Zhang Xiaoshi's beasts are vividly depicted. Li Zhongjie's landscapes are rigid and vigorous, and Lou Yuqing's flowers and birds are elegant and interesting. Huang Zongxiang's landscapes are victorious in ink rhyme. Sang Boyin's figures capture the true essence of Xiaomei. His younger brother Zhongming's landscapes follow Shigu. Xue Shifang's flowers resemble his teacher Jia'an very much. Tang Yifang imitates Gu Ximei's ladies, and his brushwork is quiet and solemn. Yu Yinzhan is the only female painter in this society. Her landscapes are colored and free from smoke and fire. Her calligraphy has the styles of Yu Yiweng, Song Jin, Yang Shen, Si Qi, Chen Taoyi, and Yu Luxue, all of which are like dragons and snakes flying, with strength penetrating the paper. These are all orchids in art, moved to the seaside, and emitting a unique fragrance. Moreover, there are many ancient paintings and calligraphy collected by a certain member of the Yong Society. Wandering among them is like looking at each other and smiling with artists from ancient and modern times. We urban people are immersed in red lights and green wine every day. In this sultry weather, do we want to wipe away ten buckets of vulgar dust and wash away the mounds in our hearts? Why not go there? This is a cooling and calming agent.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Earnest Words of Advice Without Slapping the Table in Vain; The Sound of Money and Shadows Pitifully Selling People</p>
<p>Jia Duocai folded his arms in front of his chest, sneered, and snorted from his nose. Yang Wanhua also put on a stern face and said, "Sister-in-law Hu, you are too ungrateful. Master Jia is spending money to marry a concubine, how can he give you a paper receipt? In front of Master Jia, I want to reveal the truth, as long as the girl passes the door and gets Master Jia's favor, then there is nothing that cannot be done." To Zhuhushi, "You should sign the paper, it's getting late, you should go back early to pack up for the girl." A full set of pens and ink were placed next to the paper. Yang Wanhua helped her up, dipped the pen in ink, and handed it to Zhu Hushi. She took the pen and kept trembling. Yang Wanhua said! "Just draw a cross, why are you trembling?" Zhu Hushi said: "Hey! Yang, once I sign, my child..." She suddenly stopped here. Cheng Zhiqian, who was outside the window, felt that these words were extremely pitiful, and could not bear to listen or watch, so he returned to his room to sit and watch. After about ten minutes, footsteps passed by on the corridor, it was Sister-in-law Hu and Zhu Hushi talking. Zhu Hushi said: "His aunt, do you think Master Jia will let us come and go in the future? Otherwise, today is killing my child. Although she is a girl, I will keep my widowhood for a lifetime, and there is no second one in front of me." He mumbled and bit, and walked over. Zhiqian couldn't bear to hear the words of this pitiful woman. Then, with a giggling sound, Zhang Jia Yang, a man and a woman, also passed by. (257)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As soon as the prescription was delivered to her hand, she hurriedly flipped through it one by one; but she saw her frowning, shaking her head, smiling, and groaning, as if she was extremely suspicious of the four prescriptions.</p>
<p>"This is what we dislike the most, why is it written down?" The Empress Dowager pointed to each medicine name with her finger and criticized it very casually: "This is not worth anything; this is very common, everyone knows it is used to refresh the mind, we don't want to use it either! Look at this, I don't know what it's for?"</p>
<p>The old eunuch, who had a thorough knowledge of various Chinese medicines, leaned over and looked at the Empress Dowager's finger. Fortunately, his eyesight was not bad. He immediately opened a medicine book and replied:</p>
<p>"This is for cooling the blood, back to the Old Buddha!"</p>
<p>"Good!" The Empress Dowager nodded and replied: "This one can be used, write it down! What does this one mean?"</p>
<p>She pointed out another medicine name, and the old eunuch leaned over again, looked clearly, and turned out a medicine book as evidence.</p>
<p>"This can clear people's heads and eyes, Empress Dowager."</p>
<p>When the Empress Dowager heard him say this, and looked at the medicine book, it was written in the same way, so she nodded again and waved to the eunuch in charge of writing, telling him to write down this medicine as well. (357)</p>

<h3 id="e181">The Viewpoint of "Suzhou" and "Wuxi" <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Transferred from Tao</p>
<p>Along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, there are indeed many scenic spots, and the scenery of Jiangnan can be said to be occupied by the Beijing-Shanghai railway line; in addition, in recent years, the local authorities have spared no effort in sorting out the landscape; for example, Qingyang Port and Kunshan, although they are very small areas, have become places for Chinese and Western people to visit on holidays because of the good scenery. However, strictly speaking, among the many scenic spots on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Suzhou and Wuxi are naturally the most appreciated and praised by the general public.</p>
<p>The land of Qingjia in Sanwu has already told us in history. There are many ancient relics of famous people in Suzhou; the mountains and rivers and scenery are all worth praising. Looking at the poems and articles of the predecessors, I don't know how many praised Suzhou. Suzhou can be called a state of cultural relics, which is beyond doubt. Moreover, the beauty of Suzhou, good scenery is still the second, the first is quiet, that is, the residents of Suzhou also seem to be indifferent to the world; if a person can live in Suzhou for a long time, Qingfu is the most enviable. No wonder in recent years, many retired officials have to buy houses in Wuxia, which shows that Suzhou is suitable for living, and has been generally recognized. Therefore, it is more accurate to call Suzhou a residential area.</p>
<p>Suzhou is indeed a good place, but in my opinion: Suzhou is only suitable for living, when it comes to scenery, it should be left to Wuxi, everyone may also believe this sentence; anyone who has been to Suzhou can always know, where is the good scenery? Even the locals who grew up in Suzhou may not be able to answer; Tiger Hill can only be regarded as a mound, Tianping Mountain is just a false name, and what other mountains are worth lingering on! As for the ancient relics like Hanshan Temple, they are even more desolate and pitiful, only suitable for poets and scholars to mourn, and not to mention the scenery! The scenery of Wuxi can be called unique on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Along the Taihu Lake, Yuantouzhu, Xiaoji Mountain, Meiyuan, and Zhongyuan, which one is not as lovely as a fairyland; as for the spirit of the people of Wuxi in organizing the scenic area, it is also really admirable, and Suzhou is only one in ten thousand!</p>
<p>Therefore, I think: Although "Suzhou" and "Wuxi" are often referred to together, the local situation is really different. To travel and enjoy the mountains and rivers, it is better to go to Wuxi; to live, of course, Suzhou is the only one; and the "living" scope of Suzhou is also very narrow, its benefits, in addition to quietness and comfort, you can't get anything else. Someone said: "The food in Suzhou is famous far and wide, and living in Suzhou, you will always enjoy the taste of food." Oh my! I object to this sentence. Where can the food in Suzhou be compared to Wuxi? Not to mention Wuxi, even other places can't be compared, because no matter how small a place is, there will always be one or two specialties in "eating" that other places can't match. May I ask: What is Suzhou's famous specialty? Everything, although it can't be said to be bad, you can't say it's good, it's just ordinary! If you say that the dishes in Suzhou are fresh, they are still not as good as Wuxi, because the restaurants in Wuxi raise fish and shrimp in the river, how can Suzhou do that? Many Shanghai friends go to Suzhou to play, and come back dissatisfied after eating, this is an ironclad fact.</p>
<p>I am not despising Suzhou and praising Wuxi, but just speaking my observations.</p>

<p>On the 4th, the Ministry of Education issued an instruction to the private Railway College, the original order roughly stating: "The college was previously prompted by the Ministry to improve according to key points. Now, according to the inspector's report, the college buildings are extremely unsuitable, there are still many teachers, the part-time salaries are meager, the students' level is low, the enrollment is excessive, the usual training is not serious, important personnel fail to take practical responsibility, various forms and statistics are mostly missing, the economic and educational situation cannot be investigated, equipment additions are extremely economical, books are still lacking, and the equipment of the attached secondary vocational classes is particularly simple. Recently, internal disputes have arisen in the college. Upon inspection of the submitted information, the college has not made any improvements regarding the Ministry's orders and prompts for the past year, and other handling situations are mostly unsuitable. It should have its establishment revoked, but it is given a final opportunity for improvement. It is temporarily ordered to suspend enrollment this year. All the following points must be strictly rectified within one year to observe the subsequent effect. The rectification situation should still be reported to the Ministry for review at any time. 1. School buildings and school equipment are not applicable and should be repaired, built, and purchased separately. 2. The accounting department of the college was approved by the Ministry to set up secondary vocational equipment. The equipment is simple and should be discontinued to concentrate efforts and enrich the content. 3. Students' coursework should be seriously assessed and training equipment must be added according to the designated funds for teaching and reference needs. 4. Teachers should still focus on full-time teachers and improve their salaries. Those who teach up to thirty hours per week should be restricted. Office staff must be vigorously rectified to improve administrative efficiency, management and hygiene, and should be improved. This order," and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Teng Baiye's Opinions on Municipal Museum, Collections Should Focus on National Cultural Heritage and Efforts Should Be Made to Transplant the Tang Dynasty Murals of Dunhuang <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The construction of the municipal museum in the city center is nearing completion. Its scale will be unique in the country. Mr. Teng Baiye, director of the Department of Fine Arts at Shanghai Hujiang University, is very familiar with the museum's situation. He has interned at the Chicago Field Museum, the New York Museum of Natural History, and the Harvard University Fogg Museum for many years. He has also visited and inspected major museums in various countries around the world and has a wealth of knowledge. He has contributed many opinions on the municipal museum. Mr. Cai Yuanpei, a director of the museum, is very satisfied and will submit them to the board of directors for adoption. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) The collection of the municipal museum should focus on the national cultural heritage. To revive the nation, it is necessary to promote the crystallization of the nation and create a kind of combined psychological symbol among the people. Moreover, the national cultural heritage will become less and less in the future. If it is not preserved, it will be exported abroad as much as possible and will not return. (2) The collection must have some items that can occupy a superior position in museums around the world, so that scholars from all over the world can come to the country to study. (3) The museum should petition the National Government to send people to Dunhuang, Gansu, to completely transplant the Tang Dynasty murals to preserve the antiquities. These murals have long been coveted by foreigners and half of them have been lost. Moreover, the local residents have limited knowledge and cause much damage. During the Russian Revolution, soldiers who fled and stayed in this area suffered looting. If there is another Russo-Japanese or world war, China will no longer have ancient murals. (The transplant method can be provided when necessary.) (4) The municipal museum should reserve the absolute sacred right of selection for the collection. The donation of individual works of art by artists or the personal collections of collectors should be considered or refused. (5) When the municipal museum has the resources to collect Western art for the purpose of providing the people with a noble and correct education in Western art, it is essential to not buy original works. Because the value of original works is very expensive, it is not within the capacity of the current national economic strength. Baiye believes that a full set of colored Western prints and plaster models of most Greek sculptures can be purchased as much as possible. (1) The value is cheap, (2) they can be freely selected, (3) they can provide the people with concrete and systematic opportunities to appreciate and educate Western art, and (4) artists who study Western painting can also learn from them. (The success of this kind of plan also requires about 100,000 yuan.) (6) Within three years of its establishment, the municipal museum should focus on mobile loan exhibitions and borrow items from domestic collectors and shops for public exhibition to prepare for purchases. (7) When the municipal museum holds exhibitions, it should display the exhibits separately according to the topic, such as ancient and modern fish painting exhibitions, Southern Song ink painting exhibitions, blue and green landscape painting exhibitions, orchid and bamboo painting exhibitions, etc., so that the public can have the opportunity to conduct systematic research and appreciation, in order to increase general knowledge and concrete appreciation. (8) The municipal museum should hold regular lectures and screenings of art films under the guidance of the Municipal Education Bureau. (9) The municipal museum should cooperate with the Antiquities Preservation Association to investigate and register the Chinese cultural relics scattered abroad. (Baiye can provide 50% of the materials, as he has taken this as his responsibility when he was abroad.) (10) The municipal museum should cooperate with the provincial governments to excavate antiquities for preservation. (11) The municipal museum should ask the Academia Sinica for donations of some of the antiquities they excavated from the ruins. (12) The municipal museum can borrow some cultural relics from the Palace Museum, either for three years or one year, rotating borrowing and returning them for the research of the people of Shanghai. (13) The municipal museum should contact collectors abroad, borrow and exhibit each other, or exchange collections, or purchase or exchange important representative treasures of our country scattered abroad. (14) The municipal museum should cooperate with art schools to restore various kinds of old Chinese arts that have been lost or are about to be lost, such as printing, lacquer painting, bamboo carving, jade carving, etc. (15) The municipal museum should have air humidity and temperature control. (16) The municipal museum should hire specialized personnel to be in charge of exhibition matters. This work seems easy, but it is very difficult to do well. Hanging pictures all over the wall cannot be called a good exhibition. The hanging of a painting, high or low, near or far, is closely related to the ink color, newness, size, mounting, and light, as well as the walls and colors of the neighboring paintings. (The cluttered hanging of the London pre-exhibition is ridiculed by professionals.) (17) The walls of the municipal museum should be earth gray, and the floors and other wood materials should be light brown Phoebe nanmu. Otherwise, it will inevitably lead to a counterproductive result. The word "simple" is the highest theory in art.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Sports Expert Zhang Jiwu Talks About His Impressions of Overseas Inspection, Germany Uses Sports Training Instead of Military Training, Sports are Very Popular in Various Countries as Part of Daily Life, China's Sports are Still in a Distorted State of Development <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jiwu, the director of physical education at Nankai University in Tianjin, went abroad during the summer of 1933 to specialize in physical education and examine the status of sports facilities in various European and American countries. He obtained a master's degree in physical education from the German National Institute and was also very concerned about the social, economic, political, and educational aspects of various countries. He originally intended to conduct further research and inspection, but due to his wife's serious illness, he returned to the country on the Japanese Empress wheel on the evening of the 2nd and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. He socialized with colleagues in the sports world in Shanghai and visited the newly built municipal stadium. He then took a train north on the night of the 3rd. When asked about his impressions of this trip, Mr. Zhang briefly described the general situation due to the suddenness of the time. The narration is as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Experience</p>
<p>After going abroad, Mr. Zhang first went to Germany and entered the German National Academy of Physical Education, specializing in the study of physical education administration and social sports. Then he went to various European countries for inspection. After a year, he went to the United States for inspection. He spent a total of one year in Europe and one year in the United States. On the way back to the country, he stayed in Japan for a short time. Due to time constraints, he was unable to conduct a thorough inspection. He obtained a master's degree in physical education from the German Sports Academy. He participated in the doctoral degree examination in the United States, but he did not submit the thesis in time because of the news of his wife's illness, so he waited to return to the country. He continued to write after returning to the country, and then he would send the manuscript to the United States.</p>
<p>German Sports</p>
<p>German sports emphasizes society first, followed by schools. Under the jurisdiction of Fathesti, the organization is very thorough. Regardless of men, women, old or young, all must receive physical training. Especially after the European War, Germany was deeply oppressed by various countries, such as restricting armaments and not allowing military training. President Hitler, in view of this, forced the implementation of physical training. The methods of physical training include not only practicing gymnastics and various sports, but also including knowledge related to military affairs. Therefore, people from all walks of life in the country can exercise and have military knowledge. It is called physical training, but it is actually military training, and its effect is even greater than that of independent military training, and it will not be interfered with by various countries. Once the country is in trouble, the people of the whole country will be able to sacrifice themselves to defend the country.</p>
<p>Italy, etc.</p>
<p>Italy's sports are completely important in the social aspect. Mussolini attaches great importance to physical training. After work hours, people must go to the sports field. All sports administration is presided over by the government. Regarding the attendance of athletes at the 1936 World Games, Mussolini has ordered active training to win glory for the country. Finland specializes in social sports. Almost none of the athletes attending the World Games are students. Denmark, Sweden, and other countries still adhere to the old methods, focusing on soft gymnastics. The domestic people in the United States are very familiar with physical education, and social and schools are equally important. The athlete system is particularly valued. Japan is similar to the situation in the United States, but special attention is paid to elementary school physical education. Every elementary school is very perfect in terms of physical education facilities and administration. Russia specializes in social sports, which is presided over by the Communist Party. The promotion is very strong and has spread throughout the country. As soon as people have free time, they go to the sports field to participate in activities.</p>
<p>Thoughts and Feelings</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang also talked about his many thoughts on domestic education. Our country's sports emphasize schools and neglect society. People still regard sports as unimportant. If sports rely solely on schools to promote, it is the most passive method. For example, building a great stadium is only for the purpose of opening a sports meeting, and the meaning does not seem to be very profound. Sports fields are lined up everywhere abroad, but there is still a problem of overcrowding. This is because sports have been popularized, and there is a need for more sports fields to induce exercise. The idea is not undesirable, but it is ultimately a distorted phenomenon. Therefore, in the domestic situation, the first step is to start from the bottom level, and then we should try to link the upper and lower level work together. If so, the results can be faster.</p>

<p>The Tokyo Table Tennis League, recognizing the increasing development of table tennis in our country and the considerable combat power in terms of skills, invited our team to Japan in the spring of the 16th year of the Republic, due to the Shanghai Chinese team's renowned reputation. As a result, our country defeated Japan's strongest Osaka Kota Spinning Factory team with a superior score of four to one, which was widely reported in newspapers, shocking the entire country. Although our country suffered a disastrous defeat in the Far Eastern Games demonstration match later, the Japanese people's belief in and fear of our players' skills remained unchanged, regarding us as Japan's imaginary enemy, practicing diligently day and night, all with the goal of being able to defeat our country, as if there could be no greater honor. Therefore, the planning of the Japanese team's expedition to Shanghai never ceased. Due to international trends, the event was suspended. Now, they plan to take advantage of the summer vacation in August to travel across the ocean for an experimental exploration, to fulfill their ambition. Their ambition is so great that it is no different from annexing mountains and rivers. The greatness of their spiritual and financial sacrifice can be seen here. Therefore, our country's table tennis authorities should plan ahead, prepare their troops, and have proper plans to counter strong enemies in order to protect international glory. Because this matter is of great importance, a meeting must be convened to discuss the organization, selection, training, and combat arrangement of Shanghai's elite players with a spirit of collective wisdom and effort, so that there may be hope of victory against the formidable enemy.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Finance: Foreign Banks Bullish on Long-Term Trends, Gold Bidding Sees Many Buyers, Once Reaching $30 - Falling Back $5.60 <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw foreign banks unable to satisfy demand, and there were rumors of aggressive buying by the United States, leading to the clearing of floating long positions. The outlook for silver prices was bullish, prompting some long positions to be cleared, pushing prices back below $30. Prices then recovered slightly at the end. In the morning, it was reported that the overseas silver market had contracted, but not by much, and that the United States was aggressively buying after the close at posted prices, with India also making slight purchases above the posted price of 0.0625. Forward silver prices in Monte Carlo rose and fell by varying amounts. Exchange rates were normal, and the price of raw gold in London fell by one penny, causing market sentiment to turn weak. The preliminary trading outside the market opened lower, falling to $36.67. Reuters reported that the London silver market saw the gradual clearing of floating positions, and the news that the outlook was stabilizing caused selling pressure to increase, continuing to fall to $31.11. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with both British and American rates unchanged. The Customs Gold Unit fell by one cent, and the standard gold bidding price was posted at $866.70, which had little impact. The morning opened lower, but after opening, large players began to buy aggressively, causing the market to stabilize slightly. Unexpectedly, the bank's selling was enthusiastic, and the exchange rate hardened, leading to activity by sellers in the market, and prices finally fell below the $30 mark, becoming very weak. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to maintain support, allowing prices to rise. It was learned that the HSBC Bank's posted rates for British and American currencies were unchanged, and the bank was still placing orders, leading to a lot of maneuvering and struggling around $30. However, there were many players in the market taking advantage of the low prices to buy bars, and prices recovered slightly, but the rise was weak and very temporary. The bank continued to place orders at high prices, and prices soon fell back below $30. Sellers watched from the sidelines at the low prices, and it was easy for prices to rise, but the supply remained strong even after the high prices. After that, prices rose and fell frequently, and the situation was confusing, but the trading range was very narrow. Later, the off-market price fell to $28.89 due to retail selling. After opening, large players worked hard to buy bars, breaking out of the $30 barrier and gradually stabilizing. However, due to the bank's selling and the Morning Post of India reporting a long three annas, trading was still difficult. Large players continued to buy aggressively, and the exchange rate gradually tightened. The Indian silver price recovered slightly by two annas for the second time. After that, prices continued to rise, and the final situation was bullish. The market was initially weak but then stabilized throughout the day, hovering around $30. Buying interest has not been completely extinguished, and the bullish trend is still strong. A record of the day's market situation is provided below.</p>

The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, the British and American rates were flat, the Customs Gold Unit fell by one cent, and the impact was not significant. After opening, the banks slightly made pairs, but soon the banks took advantage of the situation to sell out because the Central Bank had some appetite, and the process hardened again.

<h3 id="e210">Securities: Market Sentiment Uncertain, Government Bonds Fluctuate Differently <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was extremely chaotic. Due to the uncertain sentiment in the market, prices often moved in opposite directions before and after a transaction. Although the market showed a slight increase at the close, the situation was not yet firm. Looking at the overall market situation, it seemed to be gradually showing signs of hovering, and if there were no new fluctuations in the future, it was feared that it would stabilize for a while. Yesterday, the market opened in the morning, and 18 Customs Bonds fell by 40 cents, while administrative reorganization decreased slightly by 10 or 20 cents. Disarmament bonds, due to the needs of retail investors, were raised by about 20 cents in the forward market, while the 19 Customs Bonds decreased slightly. The 19 Customs Bonds forward market had not opened for several days, falling by 70 cents. The 20th Series started at number 54 and number 20, and the demand was gradually increasing. The supply was greater than the demand, and all prices uniformly rose by 30 or 40 cents. In the secondary market, the preceding bonds continued to be absorbed, and the market price continued to rise. The 20th Series suddenly turned weak again, and numbers 75 and 1 were sold off, and all prices suddenly fell back by 20, 30 cents to half a yuan. The gold short-term bonds rose sharply by one yuan the day before, but yesterday all fell back, because there were few transactions at that price and it failed to enter the right track. The afternoon opening was still chaotic. The preceding bonds decreased slightly by 5 cents or 30 cents. The value-added tax bonds rose back by 20 or 30 cents, and the close rose by 5 cents to 40 cents due to rumors, but the sixth issue rear bonds saw no strength. Overall, the market price for the day showed mixed results, with increases and decreases only amounting to 30 to 50 cents. The 19 Customs Bonds forward market fell sharply by 60 cents. The total transaction volume was 12.23 million yuan. A comparison table of the high and low results is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday's (3rd) New York stock market was mixed but firm. Because there was no market the next day, it was very sluggish. Public utility stocks were quite strong before the close. The rise of bank stocks was due to the hope that the bank case might allow banks to underwrite securities. The bond market and small exchange stocks also rose slightly in a mixed manner. The total transaction volume for the day was 720,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and weakened in the afternoon, making the situation increasingly chaotic. The market sentiment was divided. Because the Japanese yarn sales market showed improvement and various parties were buying enthusiastically, market prices were mutually inflated. However, Chinese yarn business was flat, although more active than the previous day. Japanese merchants' standard open positions were still insufficient to offset the situation. The overseas cotton industry situation was particularly high.</p>
<p>Yarn Up One Yuan This Month</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, all months showed an upward trend due to the continued rise in foreign cotton. A large number of transactions in Japanese yarn and the gradual increase in prices improved sentiment slightly. However, prices fell again in the second session, and recovered at the third closing. As a result, each month rose by 6, 7, 8 cents to 1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening in the afternoon, market interest was still flat. Prices suddenly fell in the second session, with many saying that Japanese merchants were selling short again (but after the closing, an investigation of the market accounts showed that there was no large-scale selling). At the third closing, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were good, and the cotton market was firm. As a result, the current month remained unchanged from the morning closing, while distant months fell by 2, 4, and 6 cents. Sales records show that Tongji sold 2,300 bales, Dafu 1,950 bales, Yida 850 bales, Jinchang 2,550 bales, Xincheng 500 bales, Gengfeng 600 bales, and Changfeng 400 bales. Purchases include Jifeng 550 bales, Minghua 750 bales, Changfeng 450 bales, Shenji 850 bales, Yida 1,250 bales, Runkang 800 bales, Yongda 750 bales, Hexing 500 bales, and Xincheng 500 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Open Interest</p>
<p>July Future 164.1 161.3 164.0 Up 1.00 31,150</p>

<p>Total 205,050</p>
<p>Large Transactions in Japanese Yarn</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still smooth. Statistics show that various guilds bought a total of 895 bales throughout the day. More than 2,000 bales of Japanese yarn were transacted. The market for domestic yarn was flat, while Japanese yarn thread rose by about 2 yuan. The purchase amounts of various guilds are as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing 5 Henan 10 Guangzhou 315 Xuzhou 20</p>

<h3 id="e213">Near-Month Cotton Still Subject to Squeeze <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market remained firm, and the clamor for squeezing near-month positions grew louder. General short covering activities tightened the market further. The July contract had already broken through the 2-yuan barrier. At a time when spot cotton inventories were abundant, this squeeze was actually occurring. In fact, after a long period of decline, once a rebound occurs, it is temporarily difficult to relax.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Short Covering Competition</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, U.S. and Indian cotton markets continued to rise, but gold prices fell back by 10 yuan. The near-month market was relatively flat, while distant months were seen to be rising. By the second and third sessions, the market suddenly tightened. This was because Runkang was buying heavily, and it was also said that Dong Cotton Firm was also buying, which further boosted the market. As a result, each month rose by 2.5 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening in the afternoon, the current month was quite firm, with bulls buying more, and the market price rose. Prices softened again in the second session, but suddenly rose at the third closing. As a result, each month rose by 0.5 to 1.5 cents compared to the morning closing. Sales records show that Tongji sold 3,800 dan, Gengfeng 1,000 dan, Dafu 5,900 dan, Yuanda 2,000 dan, Mingde 1,900 dan, Shengyuan 1,000 dan, Yikang 1,300 dan, Yifeng 1,400 dan, Changhe 1,700 dan, Junchang 2,800 dan, Taichang 1,400 dan, and Yichang 1,300 dan.

<p>Factory Demand Suddenly Active</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption has shown slight development. This is because foreign cotton is gradually rising, and the Japanese yarn sales market has suddenly become active. Therefore, there has been a large purchase of raw materials, with a total of about 1,800 pieces transacted. However, there were no transactions by Chinese factories. Sources include 160 bales of Yao cotton and 61 bales of Tong cotton.</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with declines in all months of 3 to 6 points due to poor Liverpool news and good weather. Subsequently, the July contract rose sharply, and brokers bought in, while shorts covered. Japanese merchants and spot traders bought the October contract, and market prices gradually rebounded. There were not many new accounts, and peers were still watching. The closing was firm. Spot prices rose by 10 points, and futures prices rose by 6 to 12 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures prices rose by 5-6 points. Indian cotton initially firmed due to speculative buying and short covering, but then weakened as bulls took profits. Phalgool rose by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Oom rose by 1.25 to 2.25 rupees, and Broach rose by 1.75 to 2.5 rupees. Original telegram (dated 3rd).</p>

<p>The flour market rose and then fell, and the market sentiment was mixed. Although foreign wheat was quoted at small prices from 48 cents to 1.20 yuan, and the weather had cleared up, the floodwaters in the Yangtze River area had not receded. Although the mills had seen smooth sales the previous day, they stopped afterwards. Therefore, the opening prices for all months rose by about one cent. By the afternoon opening, all months turned down again, especially the distant months. Furthermore, the dumping of spot foreign wheat became increasingly rampant. Fu'ao wheat was quoted at only 4.52 yuan, resulting in a large volume of selling. Many bulls also unloaded their positions, falling by nearly 1-2 cents compared to the morning closing price, and distant months falling by 3-4 cents. Observing the subsequent movements, there is a fear that changes may still occur due to foreign wheat. As a result, the current month was unchanged, August fell by 1 cent, September fell by 1.5 cents, October fell by 0.5 cents, November fell by 2 cents, and December fell by 2.25 cents.</p>
<p>The wheat market opened in the morning with a rather positive sentiment. Because foreign wheat fluctuated very slightly and gold prices also had little change, brokers, considering that floodwaters had not receded in various places and fearing that deliveries would be obstructed, saw active standard buying. The current month was up 5-6 cents from the previous day. Distant months, however, were affected by the dumping of spot foreign wheat, and sentiment was also weak. Observing the dull situation in subsequent trading, there is a fear that it will be broken again by foreign wheat. As a result, the current month rose by 3 cents, August was unchanged, September fell by 1 cent, and October fell by 2 cents. Spot wheat was raised by 3-4 cents due to mills releasing shipments of ship wheat. Train wheat was not taken up for other reasons. It was heard that Zhenjiang wheat from Wai Tu was 3.41 yuan, Danyang wheat was 3.41 yuan, second-grade wheat was 3.06 yuan, Yangzhou wheat was 3.42 yuan, second-grade wheat was 3.40 yuan, Daqiao wheat was 3.45 yuan, Zhitang wheat was 3.46 yuan, Benniu wheat was 3.44 yuan, Guandian Mingguang wheat was 3.49 yuan, Yanghe Chuzhou wheat was 3.47 yuan, Kunshan wheat was 3.45-3.46 yuan, and Penglai wheat was 3.42-3.44 yuan. Fufu and Liang factories each took 3,000 bags, and Xinda took 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>The bran market has been in a state of sluggishness for a long time. The purchasing power in the inland is really thin, and the prices of various commodities have been falling continuously. As a result, most farmers who use it as feed have stopped buying, and the mills' stockpiles have been thickening step by step. Therefore, the current asking price has fallen to as low as 1.93-1.94 yuan.</p>

<p>The source of domestic (Shanghai South) yesterday was similar to before, with more than 20 firms arriving (nearly 5,000 shi of goods). The market situation was not good. The sales in the local market were slack. The Qingdao, Yantai, and Weihaiwei firms only bought around 500 bags, and all chose fresh goods. The market price fell. The prices of thick japonica and thin indica rice fell by varying amounts. After a sharp drop in the dark rice price for days, there is now a slight movement and a chance to stabilize. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, 11-12 boats arrived from the river. White japonica rice transactions in the market are still flat, and prices have fallen by several cents to a dime. Early thin indica rice arrived in small quantities, and sales were still acceptable. The market situation is stable. White rice shipments continue to arrive, and those picking up short lots can trim another 10-20 cents. The remaining goods also show a sluggish trend.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market is more active in local sales, and the market has turned from sluggish to brisk. If future sales increase further, the market price will still need to rise. Yesterday, the local market was already active, and inquiries were coming from Jiujiang and Hankou firms, and sales in Nanjing were also good. The prices of various types of rice have turned from sluggish to brisk. Throughout the day, 8,000 bags of Saigon rice, 3,500 bags of small-grain Siam, Jiangsu japonica, and local rice, and 800 bags of Hakka rice were shipped. The main destinations were inland and local markets.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cake market continued to flourish, and prices rose by another two cents. However, there were already Dalian bordered cakes being sold in the market, with a price of 1.42 yuan for delivery in ten days. 2,500 pieces were transacted. Yesterday, more than 17,000 pieces of fourth-grade cake from various factories were opened at prices from 1.38 yuan to 1.42 yuan. Also, more than 6,000 pieces of fourth-grade cake for delivery in the first half of July were transacted at prices from 1.375 yuan to 1.385 yuan. In addition, 800 pieces of Hankou Fukang third-grade cake, 500 pieces of Niuzhuang Xiyishun cake, 2,500 pieces of Niuzhuang black bean cake, 2,500 pieces of land-route Shahe light-bordered cake, 2,000 pieces of Shahe bordered spot cake, 2,700 pieces of ship-route medium cake, 500 pieces of ship-Qing medium cake, and 1,000 pieces of ship-Qing medium cake were transacted. The market prices are detailed in the market price column. Soybeans remained stable while soybean cake sales were active. There is little certainty about future changes. Yesterday, it was estimated that factories took three trainloads of all-river beans, two trainloads of Yingzhou beans, and two trainloads of Bengbu beans. Local garden square transactions included 1,000 bags of Niuzhuang Baimei beans, two trainloads of spot beans from Siping Street, three trainloads of beans for delivery in two or three days. Jiangbei firms took 100 bags of Guide beans and 100 bags of Andong mixed flower beans. There was one trainload of Siping cake with spot beans.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market continued to be strong and smooth. The market price of middle-grade precious eyebrow green tea from Yushan, Kaihua, and other routes suddenly rose by 4-5 yuan because the market lacked precious eyebrow green tea from Suian. The prices of upper and middle-grade goods from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other routes also generally hardened. However, current sources from various routes are mostly unable to be transported smoothly due to flooding, and the arrival of goods is scarce. There is a considerable shortage of goods suitable for sale on the market. Judging from the current situation, the precious eyebrow green tea from various routes is expected to continue to rise.</p>

<p>The lychees produced in Zhangzhou originally had 70% of the yield, but when they were about to mature, they were hit by continuous wind and rain, resulting in a large reduction, only about 40%. The black leaf lychees even led to a crop failure, and the early red lychees were also limited. Only the Lanzhu lychees were harvested in relatively large numbers. Yesterday, the first batch of early red lychees imported from Xiamen by Guangdong ship was only a dozen pieces, and a total of 63 pieces including Lanzhu lychees. It is heard that sales areas in the Upper River area have recently had clear weather and receding water, and if there is purchasing power, the market situation may be slightly better.</p>

<h3 id="e220">On Elegance <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Xueyin</p>
<p>Elegance is a good adjective in both Chinese life and art. Its meaning is leisure, purity, and etherealness. We don't have a complete dictionary to find out exactly when it was used as a representative of a beautiful concept, but generally speaking, it was enthusiastically advocated and worshiped starting in the Wei and Jin dynasties. At that time, it was enough to resist the high pressure of rituals and powerful ministers, and it had the same meaning as pure conversation. Although pure conversation was most influenced by Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi, elegance was due to the use of Five Stone Powder. However, He Yan, the ancestor of pure conversation, was also the first to use Five Stone Powder, which clearly tells us the relationship between the two.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lu Xun's research, Five Stone Powder was almost equivalent to opium in the late Qing Dynasty and became a very common addiction. After taking Five Stone Powder, one had to eat cold food, drink hot wine, and bathe in cold water and go for a walk. People who took Five Stone Powder did not wear shoes but sandals because their skin was easily broken. They wore loose clothing because they felt hot. As for whether people who took Five Stone Powder became thin, Mr. Lu Xun did not specify, but I think they would not be fat. Once a person becomes thin, wears loose clothing, and does not participate in physical labor, he naturally becomes elegant. Therefore, when we mention the word "elegance," we cannot help but associate it with hermits, poets, and figures from the Wei and Jin dynasties. Mr. Lu Xun said that those who took Five Stone Powder during the Wei and Jin dynasties were not poor. In fact, not only were they not poor, but even merchants were not worthy of it. Because the past culture was the culture of feudal landlords, pot-bellied merchants were regarded as vulgar things. Only the feudal landlord class, especially the literati from this class, talked about elegance.</p>
<p>Elegance not only appeared in history in a posture of resistance, but was also directly related to feudal status concepts and closely combined with the material life of feudal landlords. In the feudal era, the life of the landlord class was leisurely, and participating in physical labor was considered a loss of status. For example, growing long fingernails, foot binding for men, and wearing long gowns were all ways to show that they were leisurely and had status. Life determined customs, and customs influenced the concept of beauty. Therefore, at that time, all leisurely hobbies, such as tasting tea, raising birds, composing poems, and playing the qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting, became elegant. In painting, landscape paintings were particularly developed and valued, which expressed people's longing for an elegant life. Landscape paintings were an expansion of the landlord class's desire for leisure, hoping to get rid of the hustle and bustle of the world and live in the mountains and forests with the clear breeze and bright moon. They also observed things from their own perspective. Bamboo became a representative of elegance, and the pitiful fishermen and woodcutters were also beautiful subjects for poems and paintings.</p>
<p>In music, we see the special popularity of Qingchang and Xiao board in history. Chinese music takes mellowness and purity as its orthodox style. On the one hand, it is due to the beautiful relationship between the lives of landlords and literati, and on the other hand, it cannot be unaffected by the concept of loving elegance. The story of the Tang Dynasty people singing seven-character quatrains and painting on the walls of flag pavilions is eternally fascinating. As for mentioning the Song Dynasty people singing poems, we immediately think of poets carrying prostitutes on boats on moonlit nights, and the scene of "Little Red singing softly and me playing the xiao." After the Song Dynasty, Sanqu replaced the status of Ci. However, it is also based on mellowness and purity, mostly quiet and delicate tunes. There are no gongs and drums or dialogue when singing, so it is also called Qingqu. Yuan Zhonglang, who paid the most attention to elegance, said in "A Record of Tiger Hill": "By late at night, the Xiao board was no longer used. When one person took the stage, the audience held their breath, and the sound was like a fine hair, echoing through the clouds." How pure and elegant this is!</p>
<p>Elegance is expressed in literature as a combination of light and spiritual styles. Originally, the two were interrelated and difficult to separate. In history, both had rebellious significance. Tao Yuanming and Yuan Zhonglang were both literary rebels of their time. In the era of Tao Yuanming, court literati led literature to a dead end, with only a gorgeous shell and no soul. In the era of Yuan Zhonglang, the trend of imitating the ancients was particularly prevalent, and literati forgot that there was still a self when writing. Therefore, Tao Yuanming and Yuan Zhonglang both tried their best to pursue nature. There are two kinds of nature: one is the nature of scenery, and the other is the nature of human nature. Leaning towards the nature of scenery, one tends to express the love of landscapes and pastoral gardens. Leaning towards the nature of human nature, one opposes imitation of the ancients and meaningless rules. Combining the two is the liberation from the shackles of reality and the ultimate in elegance.</p>
<p>However, although elegance is a good noun, we cannot forget that it is a vestige of the feudal era, and its supporters are the feudal landlord class and the literati from this class. The social conditions that adapt to it have now collapsed, and if we advocate it again, we will not get the sympathy of most people.</p>

<p>— Luo Zhi</p>
<p>The Pure Novel Theory and Veritable Record Literature Theory in the Japanese Literary World</p>
<p>The change in social life influences changes in literature; this is a natural axiom. Now in Japan, due to the changing currents of social life, endless replacements are also occurring in the literary world. The topic of early spring—Activism—is now becoming a thing of people's memories. However, just as summer comes to succeed spring, old topics in the literary world are being replaced by new ones. These new topics we can point to are the so-called "Pure Novel Theory" and "Veritable Record Literature Theory." The former was first advocated by Riichi Yokomitsu, and the latter by Sanji Kisaki. A separate account is given below:</p>
<p>Pure Novel Theory</p>
<p>The "Pure Novel Theory" is essentially something with the character of a literary methodology, so since Riichi Yokomitsu published his essay "Pure Novel Theory" in the April issue of "Kaizo," it caused a great commotion. All the writers and critics commented on it from various angles. For example, Keiyama Moriyama, in elucidating the accidental and inevitable nature of literature, severely criticized Riichi Yokomitsu's opinions on accidentality and inevitability. Similarly, Mineo Teraoka, standing on the commonality of literature, pointed out the non-commonality of the Pure Novel Theory. According to Riichi Yokomitsu himself, the essence of the Pure Novel Theory is to harmonize and integrate the current popular novels and pure literature, creating a grand romantic world like that of Dostoevsky or Balzac. It is to break away from the narrow and limited diary confession literature of the past and further create the kind of novel that the 19th century left behind—that is, fiction in the true sense, yet permeated with literary truth, a pure novel with higher artistic creation. Therefore, it addresses issues such as "commonality and purity," "accidentality and inevitability," and "long novels and short novels." At the same time, it also proposes the issue of the "fourth-person" expression method. In this view, the Pure Novel Theory seems to be solely exploring literary techniques, but in general understanding, Yokomitsu's pursuit of these expressive techniques also has something he wants to express, which makes him do so, that is, it also has a certain content. So what is he trying to express? This is the "self-consciousness" that dominates people's inner selves. So-called self-consciousness is people's method of dealing with real life and their desires. This kind of thing is expressed a lot in modern Japanese literature. Some combine it with the direction of history to whip themselves, trying to align themselves with objective reality. However, Yokomitsu's so-called self-consciousness is not like that. His self-consciousness is contemplative; it is a quest for one's inner self, detached from objective reality. It lacks any subjective meaning. Please see what he says through the character of Kyunai Yamashita in his novel "Crest."</p>
<p>"A so-called free person is someone who has a broad and unfettered spirit that allows them to independently and coolly observe their own emotions and thoughts. Mr. Karigane is an enemy to me, but only because he is an enemy, his behavior strongly teaches me what this spirit of freedom is…!"</p>
<p>This clearly expresses that Kyunai Yamashita's broad and unfettered spirit—self-consciousness—cannot become a strong spirit of freedom that whips and transforms oneself unless it can independently observe from the object in a cool manner.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to express this internal self-awareness, Yokomitsu proposed the issue of the fourth person in the novel and also hoped for long novels because "doing it this way…the writer can only die with short stories" (Yokomitsu's words). And because the movement of this white consciousness is very accidental, he hopes to introduce the accidentality of popular literature. Thus, the so-called Pure Novel Theory is created.</p>
<p>The above is a general explanation of the Pure Novel, its origin, and content. Now let's move on to the second issue.</p>
<p>Veritable Record Literature Theory</p>
<p>The advocacy of veritable record literature has a long history, brewing since last November, but it was not until recently that Sanji Kisaki published an essay, "The Proposition of Veritable Record Literature," in the May issue of "Bungei," that it became an issue in the literary world. This issue was not as lively as the previous one. Currently, only Nao Tokunaga is participating in this discussion. Veritable record literature is healthy popular literature. Please see what Sanji Kisaki says:</p>
<p>"Digging out the history buried by falsehoods, connecting its direction of movement to our present from a realistic perspective and depicting this. Such interesting popular literature must be written to be effective in opening the eyes of the masses… It follows a parallel line with realistic literature that clearly teaches the realistic significance left by history. This is a kind wish of literary scholars who mobilize a part of the function of literature and want to help the improvement of popular culture… Veritable record literature is still a creation. But it must be produced as popular literature. In this way, it cannot be absurd and unfounded. It must be a very interesting novel that extracts the realistic meaning from the subject matter… This can never become the highest artistic literature of the present. Therefore, from the standpoint of artistic literature, this kind of popular literature can be called cultural reading material that enlightens the lives of the masses—that is, 'public reading material.'"</p>
<p>This is almost all of Sanji Kisaki's theory of veritable record literature. That is, using historical subject matter, using new perspectives, to create a new type of popular literature—literature with lower artistic qualities. Regarding the basis for Kisaki's advocacy of this veritable record literature, he himself also stated:</p>
<p>"For example, what use is it to say to someone, 'You are not human!'? Therefore, in order to overcome this 'evil tendency' of mass literature, there is no other way than to create healthy popular literature."</p>
<p>Because Kisaki Sanji's advocacy contains the issue of popularizing literature, Nao Tokunaga stood up to oppose him, saying that he was advocating a vulgarized literature massification theory. He further argued that "veritable record literature" cannot be literature with lower artistic qualities, but must also be artistic literature. This artistic literature is only historical subject matter.</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, not many people are participating in the discussion at present, so as for what it should ultimately be, we can only wait and see.</p>

<p>— Zheng Hua</p>
<p>Lying under the shade of the willow, wiping away sweat, stretching out my legs only to feel them ache, looking up at the blue sky and taking a deep breath of relief, wondering if there is any sign of rain in the floating clouds? Putting the dry tobacco pipe in my mouth, closing my eyes, a gust of fresh wind disperses the tiredness from my face, turning over, patting the dust off my body, and bursting forth with new strength, struggling to stand up.</p>
<h3 id="e223">University Days (18) <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Written by German Tomo, Translated by Chen Yin Zhi</p>
<p>But at this time, I probably walked into a depression, because the air became quieter, and I walked for a long time among the dense hawthorn trees. Sometimes, when a slight breeze arose, I smelled a burst of strong fragrance, but I didn't know where it came from, because the bushes on both sides blocked my view. The boundary dike on the right suddenly turned back, and a small barren area in the shape of a hill was presented in front of me. Raspberries and blackberries grew all over the ground; in the center, next to a stream of black spring water, a slender tree stood alone in the bright sunlight. Countless white flower balls emerged from the tree's dazzling green leaves. Whether in the city garden or in the distant forest, I had never seen such a delicate scene. I watched the tree in amazement, standing in this quiet place as if it were a miracle.</p>
<p>The section of the road ahead, with only a few sparse fields separating me, was the large brown wilderness, stretching forward to where the eye could not see; the outermost boundary of the ground trembled in the air. Not a person, not an animal, could be seen within the range of sight. —I lay in the grass next to the spring, under the shade of this beautiful tall tree. A sweet, mysterious feeling invaded me; the wild finches sang softly in the distance like a dream, the wild bees buzzed in the stamens above my head; sometimes the breeze blew, and a burst of floral fragrance came to me; other than that, everything was silent, even to the farthest places. I saw butterflies dancing beside the spring water; but I didn't pay attention to them now, my butterfly net lay lazily beside me.—I remembered a painting I saw not long ago. In a vast, boundless background, just like here, a young shepherd stood leaning on a shepherd's staff, like humans just after creation, a rough goatskin often used as an apron, binding his lower body; at his feet, sat a beautiful little girl, his eyes drooping to look at her; she watched the quiet scenery under the morning sun with happiness and without thought, with her black and large eyes.—Under the picture were written the words "Alone in the World."—I closed my eyes; I imagined a second person coming from the void to my side, and with her, all my needs ceased, and all my desires were satisfied. "Nali!" I called softly, and stretched my arms out into the gentle air.</p>
<p>At this time, the sun had already set, and the evening glow in front of me was shining on the wilderness. There was no sound on the tree anymore, and the wild bees had all flown away. It was time to go home. My hand grasped the butterfly net. But what use was this thing to me now? I jumped up and hung the butterfly net on the tree, as high as I could reach on the leafy branches, and then, the portrait of the tailor's beautiful daughter swayed before my drunken eyes, and I slowly walked home like this.</p>
<p>Dusk had already fallen deeply when I stepped out of the garden gate of the mansion. Outside the gate, the wooden horse carousel, was already lit; the sound of the accordion, laughter, and the noise of people, I could hear them all, and in the middle there was also the sound of fake swords clashing against iron rings. I stood, looking through the linden trees that surrounded the square, watching the rotating shadows. The wooden horse carousel was spinning vigorously; the seats and the wooden horses were all occupied, and a large crowd of old and young, male and female, were crowded around watching. Now it was turning slower and slower, and I could already recognize a few figures from between the green leaves.</p>

<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>Turning around, the smiling face of a Javanese woman greeted me:</p>
<p>"Nyonya, my ulam (note) is fresh, look—"</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry, I'm not eating it today—"</p>
<p>"Oh…"</p>
<p>So the Javanese woman sat back down on the cement floor, dealing with other people's business.</p>
<p>There were many people in the pasar, arguing over their prices in various different languages. A newcomer from Tangshan (China) was clashing with the pockmarked Malay man because they couldn't agree on the price. The newcomer was being cursed with the most vulgar words. Our neighbor, the sister-in-law, stopped to chat with her aunt, talking endlessly about her household chores. A Malay child's mouth was close to my ear, mumbling: "We're going swimming at ×××, do you want to come—" Seeing his aunt turn her face around, he quickly slipped away.</p>
<p>There was a 60-year-old Xinhui man selling his vegetables in the corner of the pasar. My aunt said, "This Xinhui uncle's son and daughter-in-law farm in the vegetable garden, carrying the green vegetables early every morning for him to sell." And she praised his green vegetables as being better than other people's.</p>
<p>"Xinhui uncle, you're old, when are you going back to Tangshan?" Some people who were doing business with him casually chatted with him like this.</p>
<p>"Are you talking about going back to Tangshan to enjoy life?" Touching his white beard, he said with a smile, "My son hasn't made a fortune yet."</p>
<p>Another person put a pile of chili peppers on the weighing pan, asking him to see how much it weighed. So the Xinhui grandfather shifted his conversation back to the transaction.</p>
<p>The ice jelly wasn't ready yet, otherwise I could have asked my aunt for a few coppers. Seeing that there was nothing else to buy, "Let's go home!" She walked ahead again, and I followed behind carrying the heavy basket filled with fish and meat, green vegetables and broad beans.</p>
<p>And my cousin was already waiting in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I became lonely again, picked up the ukulele, and went under the mango tree to sing lonely songs. My cousin's young face often looked at me from the window; when I saw her, she stuck out her tongue again. With the most appropriate smile, I recalled that one night when my grandmother's illness reached a very dangerous point, she secretly called me to her bedside and said to me in a hoarse voice; "Little devil! Remember: If I unfortunately have to die tonight, I have nothing else to say, except that in the future, if your aunt comes up with the idea of marrying your cousin to you, for my sake, don't make a fuss, okay!" Like this, I wanted to bless my grandmother's health…</p>
<p>"Hey, hey, don't even want to eat rice? Little devil, what a strange fellow you really are!"</p>
<p>My aunt's voice woke me from my reverie. I scrambled to my feet and went back into the house to eat.</p>
<p>(Note) Ulam is a kind of food in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Research on Places for Urinating <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to visit a friend at a certain place. On the way back, I walked to a certain wide road and was really desperate to urinate. So I dashed into a small alley because I was in a hurry, and I didn't have time to check its name. As soon as I entered the alley, I saw ten large characters written on the wall with kerosene, which read, "Urinating is prohibited here; offenders will be sent to the authorities."</p>
<p>But strangely enough, under these ten large characters, there were two or three people standing and urinating directly in front of them. I was helpless, so I also did an illegal thing. At first, I was a little suspicious, fearing that because I was desperate, my eyesight was blurry, so I misread it, or perhaps it was written, "Urinating is only allowed here; offenders will not be sent to the authorities." But after finishing, wiping my glasses, and looking carefully again, it was indeed correct.</p>
<p>I thought, why do we Chinese people specialize in doing things that violate laws and regulations? It is clearly written that urinating is prohibited here, so why do people insist on urinating in this place? I am deeply puzzled. Could it be that the meaning of writing these ten characters is to invite people to urinate here, with the intention of attracting customers? But urinating requires people to be able to urinate, unlike doing business, where you can write a sign saying "Welcome to Visit." What is the meaning of inviting people to urinate? It is certainly illogical. Therefore, I conducted an in-depth study on this urinating problem.</p>
<p>First, is it permissible to urinate in that place? Assuming that it is indeed not permissible to urinate, why are those who urinate there not arrested and sent to the authorities for investigation? If it is permissible to urinate there, why insist on writing these big characters to scare people?</p>
<p>Second, why do those who urinate insist on urinating in places where it is written "Urinating is prohibited"? Indeed, there are many places in alleys where it is written "Urinating is prohibited," but there are also places where it is not written. Why not go to places where it is not written "Urinating is prohibited" and urinate there? Why insist on going to places where it is written "Urinating is prohibited" to urinate? This is a very strange thing.</p>
<p>Is it a violation of laws and regulations, the inferior nature of our people? Or is this kind of prohibition inappropriate, and is it enough to arouse the psychology and habits of those who are anxious to urinate to violate laws and regulations? Therefore, those who urinate there are indeed mistaken. But those who write these ten big characters must also take it seriously and not write them casually.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Summer in the Ancient City <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Zhuan</p>
<p>The rain poured down incessantly, hitting the clusters of thatched roofs, the sound like thousands of wild horses galloping. Coarse raindrops seeped into the houses from the roofs and loose earthen walls, and a kind of uncomfortable dampness filled these small, old, and desolate little houses. However, the souls sleeping in these houses, eroded by years and labor, slept even more peacefully and securely: this summer, it hadn't rained properly until the end of May, and people suffered in the sun all day long, unable to save even half a seedling in the fields. On this day, seeing the dense dark clouds, even the old Lianxin flowers were happy and smiled; the dream was so deep, the night was so long; in the dream, there grew boundless, fat, oily green rice stalks, and wheat waves rising with the breeze. Thus, the simple, hardworking, hopeful smile also opened in the dark night. "A good summer, an abundant summer, a peaceful and smooth summer!" People still thought so, still prayed so; no matter how dangerous this year was, how old and desolate this small city was, and how dim and terrible their destiny in this life was arranged.</p>
<p>The dim midday moon was obscured by layers of gray clouds, faintly illuminating</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>the dilapidated ancient city with gray-white and weak light, illuminating the half-wilted crops in the fields, illuminating the old, water-stained, dripping dreams, illuminating the entire ancient city's summer.)</p>
<p>Lately, I feel that the soul is young, and life is fragile, so living aimlessly among people is a little scary! Because of this, I plan to arrange my life a little simpler, a little lighter, so I took advantage of this hot weather and quietly, without letting anyone know, slipped alone into this ancient city, which has become dilapidated and desolate following the progress of the era's pathology, and settled down; here, the soul of a person may gradually age along with the dilapidation and loneliness of this region.</p>
<p>There are about fifty households here, but most of the men in their prime are gone—after a series of disasters and hardships, the dead have died, and the living have gone, not knowing where. What remains are just some withered, ancient souls forgotten by death, living in a world they will never understand, letting gray-white ordinariness accompany them, and they, in turn, accompany those dim, dull days that come one after another.</p>
<p>However, I have finally settled down here; when I first came, there was just a bit of intermittent croaking of frogs in the pond, and the weather was already thoroughly hot: in the morning, before the sky was fully bright, clusters of crimson-gold clouds were horizontally stitched on the gray-white horizon, and a stream of golden light slowly rose, a good sun was already hanging in the sky, and the ground suddenly became hot. It had been a long time since there had been any rain, and these eroded souls were used to living in hardship, and anxiety was already too common for them. They just watched the dangerous situation in the fields, all day long hanging on the waterwheels, panting until they fainted. When it rained, people would perhaps be a little more excited to loosen the soil. Some small watermelons, planted in the corner of the field in the spring, grew plump soon after a rain. They were unwilling to eat them themselves, but picked them up and carried them on poles to the town to sell; in the evening, they put a plate of salted melons on the bamboo mat in the threshing ground, filled themselves with half-cooked bean and rice (in fact, it was already rare), looked at the stars in the sky, sighed, and countless mosquitoes buzzed around in circles. In that way, another day of life slipped by.</p>
<p>As the days crawled by, I felt that the summer in the ancient city was as old, depressed, and dilapidated as its residents.</p>
<p>Oh, the summer in the ancient city.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Seven Star Crags <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>It is summer, and the south, near the equator, must be very hot.</p>
<p>At this time of year, I think of my childhood life again. For example, when I was in the south, I would either run back to the quiet countryside or travel to a shady mountain forest. I really wouldn't be attached to the city, which is full of terrible heat and depressing atmosphere. - I admire the countryside!</p>
<p>One summer, I had the opportunity to go to Dinghu Mountain in Zhaoqing, and when I came back, I wandered around Zhaoqing city to the famous Seven Star Crags.</p>
<p>In the morning, the sun, which had not yet revealed its fiery heat, seemed like a lovely virgin, shyly wearing a pink coat, drifting like light sand, with a gentle and lovely smile, like a loving mother, descending on the quiet countryside and suburbs of the small market town. The old villages, distantly arranged in the mountains and fields, were also covered with bright red clothes. The whistle blown by the wind through the treetops of the jungle and the twittering songs of the little birds filled the air with pleasant atmosphere. The green leaves were also dyed with lovely colors, as if everything had become young and virginal.</p>
<p>We left the small market town and passed through the fields along a narrow road. The quiet river flowed murmuringly like a monotonous melody. The reeds on both sides were gently swaying in the wind. I opened my eyes wide and felt that the morning in the countryside was the most precious, fresh, and progressive. The dew on the vast fields reflected the morning sunlight, as clear as crystal.</p>
<p>We ran towards the black cave, passed many hills and crossed small rivers, and met many interesting village children, who were all jumping around barefoot, so innocent. And they would stare at us with surprised eyes, laughing strangely.</p>
<p>On the way, after running for a while, the sun had lost its beautiful virgin face, and it was hanging high in the middle of the sky. Moreover, the earth had gradually reflected the fiery light, making people feel the heat of summer, and sweat quickly disappeared from their faces.</p>
<p>We came to a dilapidated temple, full of overgrown weeds, densely packed. It might be the large temple at the foot of Seven Star Crags, but after being ravaged by many storms, it had revealed a calm desolation, like a dejected person sighing. We stepped in with light steps and could not see a trace of incense, which made us feel frightened, so we quickly turned out, turned up the mountain peaks again, and slipped into the dark cave.</p>
<p>There are many myths about Seven Star Crags, but we don't care about them. We just want to tread through the dark and quiet water cave with the mood of explorers. Perhaps because this place is very cool, every summer, countless tourists come from the city, and they often don't want to leave.</p>
<p>In a winding and huge dry cave, there were temples and incense, which was very lively, but it became our "cannon firing" place, making the cave sound like a battlefield. Coming out of this cave, we slipped into a water cave like a black river. When we drove the small boat slowly into it, we gradually felt a sense of autumn coolness, even a sense of severe cold. That dark shadow was really scary. When we shone the electric light on the moist walls, we could see spots and traces of water hanging in the air. The sound of dripping was very clear and resentful. The natural artistic paintings were as fierce as executioners and as cruel as whips, all silent like death, making people feel infinitely sad. When we felt cold, we quickly turned the boat back along the original road. - It's really not good to linger in a sunless hell!</p>
<p>After wandering through such a cave, the evening sun shone and sent us back.</p>
<p>— Hu Kao</p>
<p>Let me tell you, there are still such prostitutes in Shanghai!</p>
<h3 id="e228">White Orchids <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Hong</p>
<p>Every morning, just as I woke up from my sleep and was turning over the newspaper of the day on the bed, a silver bell-like sound floated in the quiet long alley:</p>
<p>"Do you want white orchids, beaded flowers..."</p>
<p>Every day, every day, the silver bell-like flower-selling sound called out from far to near, and then gradually disappeared in the air from near to far, like a fickle dream that is difficult to grasp, recalling the fresh traces from the blur, and then turning from fresh to blur.</p>
<p>Occasionally, because I woke up early, when I finished reading the newspaper, I couldn't hear the silver bell-like cry, and I would feel uneasy in my heart, "Why hasn't the flower seller come yet?" It was as if I had a premonition that something unfortunate had happened to the flower girl with a silver bell-like voice.</p>
<p>It wasn't until that familiar sound floated from the alley that my heart settled down.</p>
<p>However, I have never bought a flower from her, and I don't even know what the flower seller looks like. I just lie in bed every day and admire that silver bell-like voice.</p>
<p>It wasn't until this happened that I bought a white orchid from her every day, and I still do...</p>
<p>Every day, yes, almost every day, as long as I had money, I would always spend my hard-earned passionate evenings in crazy jazz music. Besides dancing and drinking, passionate nights were unbearable for me.</p>
<p>Under the influence of alcohol and jazz music, I met a woman, a woman with bright eyes and dark eyelashes.</p>
<p>"Why do you always wear white orchids every day?"</p>
<p>"I like it."</p>
<p>"Is there any other reason?"</p>
<p>"No, just because I like it." After a while, again: "Oh, maybe because I can't afford perfume."</p>
<p>"You mean, if you had perfume, you wouldn't want to wear it."</p>
<p>"No, even if I had perfume, I would still wear it, I like it."</p>
<p>"Then why did you say it was because you couldn't afford perfume?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it the same as having a strong fragrance?"</p>
<p>I understood why she wore white orchids every day, and that day, she gave me one, and because it had been worn for a day, the tip of the leaf had turned yellowish-brown.</p>
<p>But I still cherished it and brought it back, hanging it on the head of a bronze Buddha on the desk.</p>
<p>The next day, the yellowish-brown color spread all over the petals. The third day, the fourth day, the fifth day... it had turned yellowish-brown and dried up.</p>
<p>But I didn't throw it away, I still let it hang on the head of the bronze Buddha. Because this is the best explanation for a dancer.</p>
<p>Since this happened, I have been buying white orchids every day, and I still do.</p>
<p>Now, I not only admire the silver bell-like flower-selling sound, but I also spend a few cents every day to enjoy the rich fragrance of white orchids.</p>
<p>And occasionally, on mornings when I wake up early, when I don't hear that silver bell-like flower-selling sound, it will especially cause me uneasiness and disappointment.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Dusk <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Bin</p>
<p>I selected a boxed novel from the bookshelf, lay down on the sofa, reluctantly calmed the boredom in my heart, and slowly opened the toothpick to pull out the book with the colored cover.</p>
<p>The cover was a statue of a girl, dyed in color, a photo from the hand of a high-end photographer. She had recently taken a liking to photography, and famous photo studios kept one or several of her negatives, but none of them were satisfactory to her. On the colored paper walls of her bedroom, various styles of picture frames hung down, which were artistic photographs cut out from pictorials, or Hollywood movie stars, which were photos that satisfied her; but none of them were her own.</p>
<p>She bought back the boxed novel because she liked the colored girl statue on the cover. In the bookstore, she wanted to tear it off, but the clerk quickly wrapped it up. It was almost dusk when she returned home. Under the milky white electric light, she opened the toothpick of the box again. With a hysterical impulse, she couldn't bear to let her own fingers destroy the beautifully bound book, although she intended to let the colored girl statue occupy a place on the wall.</p>
<p>She carefully placed it on the bookshelf, which was really frustrating.</p>
<p>She was sick for two weeks, a disease that doctors could not diagnose. Her mother loved this only daughter, and the famous doctors did not work. She advised her daughter to stay in the hospital. She even gave many examples, as if the hospital could cure diseases that doctors could not handle. The daughter understood medicine even better. She asked her mother not to come to her room to talk too much, and forbade others to disturb her need for a quiet heart: she could heal her own illness.</p>
<p>The mother did not understand her daughter's "medical skills." She stopped eating and sleeping, eavesdropping outside her daughter's bedroom door, or peeking through the keyhole. The daughter was sleeping quietly, and there was no sound in the room, as if it were a harbinger of an unfortunate event. But the mother knew her daughter's temper.</p>
<p>The daughter recovered from her illness, and the mother was relieved.</p>
<p>On the first day she got out of bed, she thought of the colored girl statue on the cover. When she slowly pulled out the book, she found worm-eaten marks on the girl's face. This made her very angry, and she tore up her beloved picture for the first time.</p>
<p>Like spring butterflies, colorful pictures flew in the air.</p>
<p>She stood up and walked to the window, opened the patterned long gauze curtains. Outside the window was the plum rain season, with fine slanting rain, as fluttering as her heart.</p>
<p>Her father's car came out from the garage, passed through the paved road lined with wintergreen, and drove towards the gate. She saw the shadows of her father and aunt reflected in the rear window.</p>
<p>She thought of her own marriage:</p>
<p>Her father was a reputable businessman in Shanghai, and what he was concerned about was economic manipulation and the improper development of his own business. Family, wife, daughter, he seemed not to need them. He put some banknotes on his mother's bedside every month and fulfilled his obligations as master, husband, and father. The marriage of his daughter, in his mind of whoring and taking concubines, there was no space to put this unimportant responsibility. The mother was born as a daughter. She entrusted the driver, the hairdresser... to choose a suitable husband for her daughter. She earnestly sought opinions from people and gods, but not from her daughter herself. Since her husband had abandoned her and she had no son, her standard for choosing a son-in-law was to meet all the ordinary conditions of a mother without a son.</p>
<p>But when the conditions did not meet her ideals, the daughter's age increased alarmingly.</p>
<p>She could no longer support her shaking blood pressure, and collapsed into the sofa chair in front of the dressing table. The mirror reflected her gray and yellow face of a young girl whose youth had passed away.</p>
<p>The mother quietly pushed the door open and asked.</p>
<p>"Mei, are you better today?" As gentle as a lover's whisper, "Bird's nest soup is cooked."</p>
<p>Leaning against the bedroom door, waiting for her daughter's reply, or a slight nod from her daughter, she could immediately step back out and bring in a bowl of freshly cooked bird's nest.</p>
<p>The daughter had never been a mother, and she did not know her mother's loyalty to her children, and she did not do what her mother hoped for.</p>
<p>"Mom, I don't like sweet things, it's too greasy to vomit!" The daughter shook her head, "Mom, you eat it."</p>
<p>The mother deliberately smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes. It's really annoying when the yellow plum rain doesn't stop! Mei, let's ask a doctor to see you tomorrow." After she made this suggestion, she was afraid that her daughter would object, so she immediately added: "My back also aches, probably because of some seasonal changes, and I have to take some medicine."</p>
<p>Clenching her fists, she gently tapped her lower back with her backhand, and went out of the room.</p>
<p>The daughter glanced at the colorful paper scraps on the ground, closed her eyes, and wanted to drive all the painful phenomena out of the door like her mother.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the rain became denser, and it was dusk again.</p>

<p>After the premiere of "Dizziness and Madness, A China Expert Makes a Big Splash", it is indeed true. Those who watched "Dizziness and Madness" all spoke clearly and praised: "You listen to the second part."</p>
<p>Some people mistakenly think that Yueming's China Expert is Zhonghua Expert. Indeed, this is easy to confuse. Here is a special explanation that Yihua's is Zhonghua Expert, and Yueming's is China Expert.</p>
<p>Li Qixi invited you to return from his travels. The outline of the film script about the frontier written at the invitation of Ren Pengnian has been completed.</p>
<p>Yueming's Tibetan film will attract great attention from the government and the public.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Shanghai Company Recruiting Actors <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Sound Film Company is now in need of three female leads for a film directed by Du Yu and seven male and female leads for a film directed by Gao Mangsheng. Therefore, those who aspire to the screen and can speak fluent Mandarin can bring their recent photos to the Shanghai Sound Film Company, Jande Building, Fuxing Road, Laobazi Road, every day from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM to register (no registration fee, photos will not be returned if not selected, registration deadline is July 10).</p>
<h3 id="e235">From "Nora" to "Statue of Liberty" <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>"Nora" is not a problem drama in the current stage; but at the moment when women all over the world are asked to return to the kitchen and to the puppet family, it still has a special meaning. Especially after the joint performance of amateur actors at the Jincheng Theater, it raised a memorandum to the silent Chinese women's movement. However, the impression this play gives them is what Nora did after she ran away, which will make them terrified, trembling, and hesitant. In Gladkov's "Cement", Dasha, who grew up in a life of hardship, has already had a correct answer. As for Situ Huimin's "Statue of Liberty", which was compiled and directed by Diantong, it actively and correctly pointed out that Nora, who ran away, was not wandering on a forked road, but training herself to be an independent and dignified person, serving the society.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Bu Wancang Directs "Triumphal Song", Tu Yin and Wang Guilin <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>

This play writes about folk stories and is full of content and powerful, deeply moving, and is truly a famous and responsible work.
