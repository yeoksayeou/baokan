<p>時評</p>
<h3>禁油運意問題</h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>墨索里尼之遠征東菲。雖不以國聯制裁而停止。然因此所受之困難。固至顯然。現十八國委員會又定本月十二日開會。表决對意禁油日期。英內閣經三小時之閣議决定參加。法政府聞亦與英成立默契。倘墨索里尼仍不就範。則禁油及其他類似之嚴峻計劃。必可於極短期問。逐步實行。此於資源貧乏之意國。殊有極嚴重之威脅性也。</p>
<p>據國聯進一步之制裁計劃。禁止運意者首為煤油汽油。次及銅鐵媒棉此類主要物產。在平時為工業所必需之原料。在戰時亦為機械化軍隊之原動力。而意國均感缺乏。如燃燒之油。九分之三仰給於美國及羅馬尼亞。煤則端賴英德之供給。如來源一旦斷絕。則工業之停滯固不待言。而軍事方面。飛機之動作與輪船之運輸尤將因缺乏燃料而失其靈活。墨索里尼鑒於前途之危機。日前决定設立國營金屬鑛產管理局。負責開採國內鑛產。並限令瓦斯廠煤鑛。儘量出產。且有以火酒代燃料之計劃。卽此己足顯露其捉襟見肘之窘態矣。</p>
<p>禁油一案。原以加拿大代表之動議為根據。乃加拿大政府日昨竟突然宣佈。其代表之建議。不足以代表政府意見。此固無足怪者。蓋不列顚帝國中。加拿大之政策素稱穩健。歷來集體保安運動。如一九二二年之互援草約及一九二四年之日內瓦議定書。莫不以加拿大之反對而功敗垂成。當國聯舉行第一屆大會時。加拿大代表曾云。「於此互保火險之團體。各國所負之責任頗不平等。吾人所處境地。固無燃燒性質。且與引火之物。距離甚遠者也。」似不願為國際安全。而多盡義務。加拿大對於國際問題之態度。始終奉此旨為圭臬。此次否認其代表在日內瓦之言論。固未嘗違反其一貫精神。且據昨日電訊。加拿大政府仍將擁護對意制裁云云。可知此事對於制裁政策之進展。並未發生多大影響也。</p>
<p>然此項制裁有效與否。還須視各國合作之程度如何。就當今情勢以觀。處重要地位之美國。雖不屬國聯。且受本國中立法之束縛。然其內政部長伊克斯已首先勸告出口商。停止售油與意。國務總理赫爾最近復表示。美棉亦有不輸往交戰國之可能。其他主要產油國如羅馬尼亞。似稍意存猶豫。然亦準備追隨各國一致行動。伊拉克惟英之馬首是瞻。蘇俄與伊朗。則更顯然贊成進一步之制裁。是則各國之合作殆可不復發生若何問題矣。</p>
<h3>解決意阿爭端　和議空氣又濃厚　英法專家談話順利　霍爾將會晤賴伐爾</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據巴黎消息、英法專家志在解决意阿戰爭之談話、進行殊為順利、聞兩國現意見不同者，並非根本要點、諸專家或可於星期秒完成其工作、衆信彼等並未商討涉及對意大土地讓與權之方案、僅討論前國聯五人委員會所提出以阿國巨大經濟利益及南部沃迦登省給予意國建議之細則、法總理賴伐爾隨時以談話進行情形告知駐法意大使塞稱蒂、此事殊可惹人注意、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間今日消息、英法兩國已决定於實施煤油禁令之前、再向意國另提和平條件、該項計劃仍將以八月中意相墨索里尼所拒絕之建議為根據、卽以阿比西尼亞由國聯代管、而以意國擔任最大之代管責任、此外尚有意阿交換土地一項、俾使阿國得一海口、據稱墨氏於此項解决辦法、頗有願意研究之表示、至於計劃本身、則猶未正式起草‘惟今日各方面對於歐洲時局之空氣已顯有樂觀之象矣、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據晨報接得倫敦消息、英國外相霍爾爵士、本星期六日由倫敦抵法、與賴伐爾總理兼外長會晤之時、將向賴伐爾提出多種建議、其性質於迅速解决意阿爭端、甚有婢益、足使英法兩國之意見、完全趨於諧和云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英法見解愈趨接近</p>
<p>（倫敦）外相霍爾爵士、本星期末前往瑞士、作若干日休憇、將於星期六日道出巴黎、與法國賴伐爾總理舉行談話、據本社訪員所知、英法兩國專家所擬解决意阿爭端之辦法、將由霍爾與賴伐爾共同加以討論、關於此項辦法、英法兩國意見現已益見接近、聞兩國已同意將阿國領土分為本部與非阿姆哈利克區域之兩部份、而以非阿姆哈利克區域歸意國控制、惟對於控制之程度、則英法兩國見地仍難一致、英國主張該區行政權雖可由意國參加、惟其主權仍當由阿國皇帝職掌、至於意國對蒂格里省之領士要求亦可予以滿足、惟以使阿國在紅海獲一海口為交換條伴云、一般人以為此種計畫、决非意相墨索里尼與阿皇所能接受云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬胸襟爲之一舒</p>
<p>（羅馬）本社外交記者消息、此間政界方面對於意阿爭端之解决辦法至昨日始覺胸襟一舒、蓋自巴黎方面洩露非正式消息、英國外務部阿比西尼亞問題專家潘德遜與法國外交部菲洲司司長聖岡旦及其他諸專家之談話、足以產生解决爭端之建議、而為意大利所可接受故也、關於解决爭端之辦法、意大利之觀點、以為阿國北部蒂格里省旣為意軍佔領、卽不應放棄、蓋該省人民到處傾心意方、自願歸降有時不及意軍開抵、而若干鄉村居民卽已紛紛來歸、一旦意軍開離其地則阿比西尼亞政府卽將濫施報復手段、是棄該省人民誠敝、屣之不若也、至在意屬索謀里蘭方面、則此間官塲人士相信巴黎專家談話、必曾談及意屬索謀里蘭與阿國南部區域間之劃界問題、新界綫將由自東北至西南之斜綫、改為自北徂南之直綫、専管殖民地問題之人士對此方面之發展情形、現方密切注意、蓋該處之山嶽地帶、易於墾闢、實最關重要也總之、截至現在為止、由巴黎傳至羅馬之消息、雖均屬非正式性質、但大都可以振奮人心、而使沉悶之空氣為之漸形淸朗云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>盛傳意與美商　成立煤油協定　羅馬與美油公司否認　美政局當局不願批評</h3>
<p>（羅馬）美聯社今日可靠方面得悉、意國政府已與美孚油公司之分行意美油公司成立「紳士協定」以應付國聯之對意煤油禁令、倘國聯制裁？整委員會通過該項禁令、則意美煤油公司將盡量以煤油供給意國、而以意國市塲之三十年煤油專賣權為交換條件、所有煤油將由美國以外之美孚油井供給、最大之來源為羅馬尼亞假道匈牙利運往意國、以免抵觸美國政府之中立政策、該項協定並規定意屬伊利脫里可由遠東方面直接供給、如此卽可無須通過英國控制之蘇彝士運河、此項計畫題已保證東非意軍之煤油供給可以永無匱缺、此間並悉美孚公司已允許對意放欵十萬萬金呂爾、俾使意國得以該欵購買煤油、一俟國聯通過實行禁油、此項協定即將生效、按此種消息宣布之後、大概將受官塲及有關係方面之否認、惟美聯社經過詳細調查三日之後、已深信其為可靠矣、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）官方今日文告宣稱、美聯社所傳意國已與意美油公司訂立契約之說完全無稽、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅馬消息謂意國政府已與美孚油公司成立媒油協定、此間官塲聞悉之後、大為震驚、國務院當局對於此項消息、顯甚注意、惟不願批評、彼等仍　美國政府之政策與國聯毫無關係、而其目的、僅為使美國免受戰禍而已云、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）美孚煤油公司董事長梯格爾今日對於羅馬消息所稱該公可已與意國政府成立協定、借給煤油之說、完全否認、梯氏謂此項協定將無法履行、並稱聆之「似為一種荒謬之宣傳」云、據稱以彼所知該公司之意國分行且絕未接得此種協定之建議、因「該地公司當局、明知此種合同、為本公司所絕對不能接受者」云、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）此問國際方而對於外傳意國政府已與美孚油公司成立協定之說、視為一種「欺人之談」蓋設或確有其事、則當事者决不致在國聯實施禁油之前、任令協定之詳細情形、洩露於外也、外交家謂、如羅馬尼亞假道匈牙利、而以煤油輸入意國、則國聯儘可以迅疾之方法阻止之云、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間消息婁通之觀察者不信羅馬所傳煤油協定之說、因羅馬尼亞早已表示願意參加對意實施煤油禁令、而伊朗美商所有之媒油將由政府當局禁止輸出云、（三日國民電）</p>
<h3>加拿大不贊成禁油</h3>
<p>（羅馬）據羅馬負責方面之意見、禁油運意之舉、因加拿大政府不以其在日內瓦代表提出此議之行動為然、故將作罷、同時駐羅馬法大使昨曾與意外次蘇維志作長談、聞法使曾請蘇氏提出解决對阿爭案之建議、惟蘇氏現尚無行動、（四日路透電）</p>
<h3>對意製裁匈國受損</h3>
<p>匈牙利京城　匈牙利商業部長狄文克爾頃向哈瓦斯社訪員宣稱、「各國實行對意制裁後所造成之局勢、對於匈國國民經濟、不特毫無利益、且至目前為止、已產生有害之結果、蓋匈牙利牲畜對意輸出、實有關匈國經濟之命脈、今匈國因不參加制裁、雖可照常輸出、然因意國方面限制消費肉類、故匈國輸出仍不免减少、且無利可得、現有大批匈國肉食貯存意國、迄未獲售」云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對國內軍火商　赫爾再發警告　勒令登記違則刑事起訴　內長表示不欲對意禁油</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）國務總理赫爾今日嚴詞警告迄未遵照中立法令登記之經營軍火貿易各商行與個人、赫爾希望彼等之未登記、乃由於疏忽所致、惟稱、在短限期之後違法者將加以刑事起訴云、（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美內務部長伊克士今日發言、變更其前所發贊成對意禁油輸出之言論、據謂渠於十一月二十一日所發關於對意阿輸出品之言論被人誤會、實則渠僅請國人遵守政府停運軍火與小麥之計書耳云、國務院對於伊克士此言、不願有何批評、但謂政府不鼓勵對交戰國大批輸出各種戰具之政策、迄今未有變更、但非欲完全禁油輸出云、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>抵抗禁油　意國有恃無恐　積極開發本國礦產　並儘量利用替代品</h3>
<p>（羅馬）各國倘實行對意禁運煤油時、意國當用兩種方法、加以抵抗、一為積極開發本國地底所蘊藏之鑛苗、俾增加本國所產煤油、一為盡量利用其他燃料、以代替媒油、國內如畢亞桑柴油井、去年全年出產煤油三萬噸、此後自當積極開採以期增加產量、此外西西里省。畢蒙省·及亞德利亞海沿岸地方、尚有油井數處、亦將加以開採、至煤油之替代品、則據研究結果、國內伐爾達諾·亞勃魯西·撒丁·恩勃里亞·薩倨柴·脫朗多·瑪傑拉·瑪爾琪朗等地所產之岩石、均含有褐炭成份、此種褐炭、卽可用以提煉媒油、此外、薩爾沙瑪傑奧地方所產沼氣、亦可用作燃料、目下多數卡車及公共汽車、已以炭氣為發動燃料矣，除此以外、木精與崁化水素精、均為最佳之媒油替代品、政府且巳採取各項措置、籍以增加酒精產量、其方法係由酒類·穀類·及甜菜中提煉酒精、然後以此種酒精與媒油摻和、製成一種新流質燃料、名為『羅波爾、』此種新燃料含有媒油百分之五十、酒精百分之四十八、目下全國各地皆有出售、同時並以炭化鈣用作汽車燃料、試騐結果成績極佳、且價格低廉尤易普及、總之、意國對於煤油供給、業已有恃無恐、證以本年汽車競賽、並未停止舉行、足見意國當局對於各國一旦禁運煤油後所發生之情形、並不認為十分困難也、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）意后今日電致墨索里尼、願以其夫婦定婚戒充戰費、電文略謂余之婚戒乃余所有物中之最珍貴者、因其使余永不忘却余幸為意人之日也云、按意后為黑山國希倫宮主、（四日路透電）</p>

<h3>日本海軍政策　堅持平等原則　倫敦會議涉及政治</h3>
<p>表示準備予以考慮　意代表團人選決定</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間負責日員今日對路透海軍會議特訪員表示意見、謂日本海軍政策之基本原則、在謀取安全、依日方之觀念、此種安全必英美日海軍之平等、及攻勢軍備如主力艦飛機母艦與萬噸巡艦之廢除、或積極限制、始可達到、日本以為各國海軍力量平等、可予人以安全、因攻方將常處於不利之地位也、日本反對造艦程序之互相宣佈、以其不承認至少在原則上之海軍平等也、日本將以和靄精神參加此次會議、如美國不採取强硬態度、則日本亦不欲有此態度、日本之參加此會、目的在成立一種妥協、而不欲負會議破裂之責、至於政治問題、則不在日代表團所奉訓令範圍之內、但日本準備考慮繼續華盛頓公約第十九條關於日本與美國不得在太平洋若干烏嶼上設置防禦工程之條文、一九二一年四國公約之考慮、為日本代表團職權範圍所不及、惟日本代表團雖未奉關於遠東不侵犯公約之訓令、然會議時如提出締結此種公約之建議、則日本亦可贊成之、日本主張廢除潛艇、但須此次會議發表不再建造潛艇之宣言、而不參加會議之德俄二國亦作同樣之依允云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）倫敦海軍會議意國代表團人選、頃已决定如下、首席代表為意國駐英大使格蘭第、其他代表則為海軍少將畢尼·海軍副參謀長皮西亞少將·海軍專家馬谷蒂尼·李卡鐸波爾哥尼三人、及陸軍中校法里那、此外並以德西里斯任代表團顧問、又駐英大使館參事維特蒂亦加入代表團服務、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯政府　計畫提高幣價　實施新經濟制度</h3>
<p>（倫敦）一般人相信蘇聯現正準備實施大批新計畫、以提高貨幣價格實行新經濟制度、自明年一月起、零售物價、將抑低百分之十五至百分之四十、工資亦將减低、但减低之比率、不如製造品及食糧價格减低之甚、換言之、表面工資雖見减低、而實際工資、則反見增加、在生產方面、蘇聯當局擬提高每一工人之平均生產標準、以此項標準作為核計工資之基礎、現行貨幣則將改定新單位、使成為健全之通貨、蓋因蘇聯金鑛開採事業之進步、與一般生產之激增、其紙幣之準備率、巳可大見提高也（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法意三國對阿角逐的史實</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>和阿比西尼亞最有關係的二大强國，要推法國最不虛憍，只在阿國中央東部佔地一小隅，為其勢力範圍，但是她對於阿國經濟發展的成就，却比任何外國為多，並且目前仍在推進不已。阿國的唯一大實業，便是法人所築長五百哩的狹軌鐵道，由索瑪里倫法國小殖民地的吉波蒂海口通至阿國京城阿狄斯阿巴巴。法人曾稱，這是不必有政治統治亦可獲得經濟成功的一個明徵。這句話的確有充分的理由。法國在阿經營百年，冀成一重要分子，直至這條鐵路造成，並目可以獲利，才收全功。法阿兩國第一次條約，成於法國統治員費理浦和阿國局部君主寒拉西之手，是一種友交協定，許法人在阿受最優惠的待遇，並享有豐富的通商特殊利益。其實，這種協定和雙方都無什麼益處，凡和阿王簽定的條約，大都是這樣的。</p>
<p>一八六二年法人以美金萬元購得太約拉灣邊的一個村莊，名叫沃波克。這灣正在紅海下端，和英屬亞丁港相對，並隣近阿國疆界。本想把這村莊作為法國殖民地的中心，後來因為其地不宜居住，便在海灣對面覓得一個完全新鎭，名叫吉波蒂的代之，於是法蘭西帝國的建設家便不辭勞瘁，前往經營，使它成為阿比西尼亞和外界交通的唯一門戶。</p>
<p>一八九四年有一法國公司靠了阿皇米尼里克朝廷法國顧問的勢力，得到由吉波蒂築造鐵道，橫貫阿比西尼亞，通至蘇丹境內白尼羅河的讓與權。這是央法兩國互相角逐以爭中菲士地所有權的第一步驟。當時蘇丹和尼羅河上游流域，都是無主的荒土，强有力者隨便可以覇佔，大家都以為誰先攫得，卽屬誰有，在這角逐中，法國為得阿國援助起見，許阿皇米尼里克擴張版圖至尼羅河；英國為得意國援助起見，許將阿國全部作為意國的活勤範圍，以為報酬。英國計謀攫取蘇丹，同時並不及對意國佔據阿國的土地一部分，意國後來曾實行這一着。</p>
<p>英國在一八八二年已佔有埃及，因此由北方發軍，越埃及而進，在前進的當兒，便征服了蘇丹。英國滿望一軍由開羅南發，一軍由好望角北推，而在白尼羅河上游會師。於是便可囊括橫亘菲陸的整片士地。但法軍也由她的西菲殖民地和東菲彈丸領土同樣猛進，也希望會師中途，席捲菲陸自西徂東的土地，而打成一片。</p>
<p>法代表在阿京簽定關於吉波蒂鐵道協定時，他夢想將來定有一天，他可在印度洋濱步入法國火車，橫越菲陸全部，而於一兩星期後在大西洋濱下車。英國所希望的，是由好望角至開羅，法國所希望的，是由印度洋達大西洋。兩國都把這種計畫委任能員進行。他們都抖擻精神，竭盡智謀，實行國家的使命。他們互爭菲洲中部名叫法旭達的一個小村莊，如同賽跑，捷足先登，那獎品是面積一百萬方哩的十地。吉靑納勳爵代表英國，率領大軍，由北方而進，遇險鑿路，遇水造橋，一路把兇悍的土人征壓帖服，法國方面，一軍由馬向德大尉統帶，從西而進發，所過一路，很多沼澤叢林，一軍由龐香浦候爵統帶，從東面經阿比西尼亞高原的峽谷而進。當時適在雨季，大雨如注，曾有一時，兵士服裝濕透，因而發抖，往往用盡氣力，每日只行六哩，如是者數星期之久。一八八九七年五月，龐香浦進抵阿京，離他的目的物約六百哩，這時馬向德已進抵烏班奇河上游，河水暴漲，不易渡過，並且前途還有許多極難通過的沼澤，吉靑納却遠距一千二百餘哩，中間還隔着三道絕大的瀑布，並且有大隊兇悍的敵人擋住進路。到了八月間，阿比西尼亞的遠征隊忽由最大的山嶺中出現，離開法旭達不足三百哩，馬向德已入尼羅河流域，距他的目的地不足五百里，吉靑納却被回敎徒所阻，相距極遠。隔了約一年之久，阿比西尼亞遠征隊進至拒尼羅河一日路程以內，忽然因故開回。但另外一隊，有阿兵萬名者，接踵而至，一八九八年六月二日，該隊在法旭達村上部數哩處揷阿比西尼亞國旗於尼羅河右岸，又在左岸揷了法蘭西國。，於是阿皇米尼里克擴張他的帝國界綫至菲洲臣流的夢想，居然實現。後十八天，馬向德率軍開入法旭達，升起法蘭西國旗。這時吉靑納還在四百哩外等候水漲，準備惡戰，法人在賽跑中，可算已獲勝利。靠了阿人援助，展開一條跨越菲洲的大路，並且佔有從尼羅河發源地到埃及中間河流一段，英國却已遭遇挫敗，最關重要的河流，竟被他人截斷。當馬向德宣布尼羅河西面的廣區為法國領土時，巴黎曾舉行奏凱的慶祝。（未完）</p>

<p>包爾溫答稱、渠願國會詳細討論甚重要的國外局勢、惟外相霍爾抱恙在家、明後日或可出席下院、届時不妨從事討論、故渠今日不願多言、本國任何政治家如不會同國聯他國舉辦有榮譽的事件、致陷本國於戰局、則其人將為衆所唾駡、條約尊嚴誠當擁護、但非條約一經成立、卽始終不可修改之謂、修改條約為一事、而取銷條約又為一事、片面取銷是謂强暴、而非同意的修改也、歐洲現决計欲阻止之者、為條約之撕毀、今年事實已證明此點、蓋歐洲各國皆與友善之一國今已被宣佈為侵略國矣、各國毅然不顧友誼、而允參加已實施之經濟制裁、並考慮將來運用之制裁辦法、人有明英國過於出人頭地者、要知英國不得不隨他國行使其本分、具有勢力之國家如英國者、不得不負起責任、而於滴當時機發表。意見、英國將會同他國研究有無榮譽的方法、以　阿與國聯所可接受之條件結束此戰爭云、</p>

<h3>上海棉布業槪况　（續）</h3>
<p>中國徵信所主編（上海工商業槪況之四）</p>
<p>四，外貨輸入激减之檢討</p>
<p>海通以後，外洋棉布輸入，數額年有增加，恒為各種輸入品之冠。惟近八年來，棉布進口數字，有逐年遞减減之象。按民國十五年棉布在輸入品中猶佔第一位，計國幣二六八·一百萬元。民十九年起退為第二位。計國幣一〇二·二百萬元。民二十仍保持原有地位。惟數量减為國幣一六七·一百萬元。二十一年又降為第三位，計國幣一一百萬元。二十二年更降至第七位。計國幣五八·二百萬元。二十三年竟降至第十位以下，計國幣一三·一百萬元。棉布輸入，在八年之間，竟由第一位降至第十位以下，數量由國幣二六八·一百萬元激减至一三。一百萬元，故一般人咸沾沾自喜，以為我國棉織業有畏足之進步。然若一究其內容，仍未許吾人過分樂觀也。蓋棉布進口激减，除民族紡織華確有相當進步外，尚有下列二大原因在。</p>
<p>（一）在華外廠激增在資本主義發展至帝國主義階段時，其對殖民地或半殖民地之經濟侵略恣態，已進一步由「商品輸出」轉變為「資本輸出」。英日諸國，在我國棉布市塲，旣已占相當之優勢，而又取得租界之特權，其須在華設廠製造，自為事勢所必然。蓋就地設廠，旣可利用低廉之華工，又可减少關稅與運費之支出、使棉布成本，降至最低限度，以增其侵銷之力量。查英日在華所設之紡織廠，以上海為最多，英商凡三廠，日商凡三十廠，其規模之宏大，資本之雄厚，均非華廠所能望其項背。依據華商紗廠聯合會本年三月所調查之數字，其比較有如下表。</p>
<p>華廠所占百分數　日廠所占百分數　英廠所占百分數　共計</p>
<p>織機四七·九六四五·九〇六·一四一〇〇</p>
<p>據上表觀察，華廠之織機，已較日廠為少，可見年來華廠基礎動搖，日廠進展不息之一斑。在華外廠日趨發達，故棉布進口雖見激减，而我國利源外溢，則依然如故也。</p>
<p>（二）購買力低落棉布為我國平民之主要衣料，棉布消費之增减，即可覘平民生活之消長。年來農村經濟破產，都市日趨衰落，平民困苦顚連，食且不給，遑論乎衣？故棉布購買力，極度縮减，本廠貨猶供過於求，外洋進口，自須激减。茲再就近三年來上海一埠之棉布進口數，列表比較如下。（單位關金千元）</p>
<p>埠別　民國二十一年　百分比　民國二十二年　百分比　民國二十三年　百分比</p>
<p>上漲　一七，〇六二　二七·六八　一三，六〇〇　四五·六〇　六，九五三　五一·〇一</p>
<p>其他　四四，五六六　七二·三二　一六，二二二　五四·四〇　六，六七八　四八·九九</p>
<p>總數　六一，六二八　一〇〇·〇〇　二九，八二二　一〇〇·〇〇　一三，六三一　一〇〇·〇〇</p>
<p>從上表觀察，無論上海或其他各埠，棉布進口均年見减少，而减少之程度，則他埠較上海為烈。是蓋內地平民消費力之低落，較沿海各省為劇烈也。</p>
<p>此外如東北四省之淪陷，亦足使我國棉布進口額激减，蓋自「九一八」事變後，東北市塲已為日貨所獨占，無須再由津滬諸埠轉口矣。</p>
<p>五·進貨情形</p>
<p>滬市棉布業，以經銷機織棉布為主要業務，其進貨來源，歷年頗有變遷，以前多仰給於經營進口業之洋行。晚近以來，因本埠及鄰近各縣，紡織廠染織廠日見發達，本廠貨幾已足敷需要。故進貨來源，與前逈不相同。據滬市棉布業公會統計，本年上期取給於紡織廠染織廠者，約占進貨全額百分之九十五，取給於巡口洋行者，約占進貨全額百分之五。茲就棉布之出產國別，分述於後。</p>
<p>（一）國貨　全市棉布業，今年上期經銷國產棉布，平均每日約有白貨一萬餘件。花色貨三四千件。與上年同時期比較。有减少一二成者，亦有减少二三成者。截至本年五月止，滬市約存白貨三萬四五千件。花色貨二萬二三千件</p>
<p>（二）西洋貨　本年截至五月止。滬市僅進口西洋貨三千件左右。其中洋紗·麻紗等，約占五六百件·府綢·膠布等約占二百餘件。漂布·西緞·羽綢·紅標·花布等約占，一千四百件。元絨約占四五百件。原布，細布等約占二三百件。全市存貨，若連同上年度已到未售者計之。約共三千餘件。其營業總額，較之二十一年度，僅及十分之一，其减退之速，實至足驚人也。俄國花標，滬市除舊存二千餘件外；今春曾進口一次，約計二百餘件。惟英商在華所設之怡和紡織廠，所出輕磅布，仍行銷市上·日出二百餘件。滬市存四千餘件。</p>
<p>（三）東洋貨查上年關稅增高後，東洋貨之五枝直貢呢，單綫嗶嘰及花布等，已無進口。惟印花貨之色子貢。印花直貢，明星呢；摩登縐；雪花小格嗶嘰等，及大路貨之元羽綢，八枚緞面直貢呢，八枚直貢緞，雙幅傘面羽綢，中山呢，元洋紗。月華絨，棉法蘭絨等，仍進口約一萬二三千件。且聞日商為减輕繳納關稅計。故將原疋棉布，剪成零段，而以零布名目，報裝入口。近年華北各地，此種零布巳充斥市塲。一般平民，以其價格低廉，莫不爭相購買。即華南各埠，亦見日增，若不設法取締，其影響於國布前途，良非淺尠。至於在滬設廠之製品。則除五枚直貢·單綫嗶嘰·漂布·粗布·市布·花布·八面布·花直貢等外，以細布·細斜·坯布為最多。每日出品數約共二萬餘件·滬市存貨，約有一萬餘件。（未完）</p>

<p>西靑籃球昨賽、海賊出馬戰約翰、形勢極為緊張、約翰同學幾全體出動、前往助威、四座宣告客滿、人氣滿騰、但交綏未及十分鐘、約不支、主將許文奎又犯規四次出塲、逐告振、結果為六十對二十二、約翰慘敗、乙組賽兩場、（一）國光力挫猶太、上半時十一對六、下半時曾打成十七對十七、勝來頗見吃力、（二）約中敗於慕爾、上半時十三對八、慕爾遠射多命中、約中陣綫凌亂、球藝確遜一籌、今晚休息無比賽、昨晚結果及甲組戰況述下、</p>
<p>慕爾勝約中（乙組）　結果三四對十九</p>
<p>國光勝猶太（乙組）　結果二二對十八</p>
<p>海賊勝約翰（甲組）　結果六十對二二</p>
<p>乙組賽後、甲組約翰與海賊繼之登塲、比賽甚的熱烈掌聲中開始、前五分鐘、局勢極為緊張、肉搏多時、許文奎罰中一分、首開記錄、海賊連加二分、王振給命中後、約翰又以三對二領前、此後局勢即轉變、海賊推行打刦、氣炳萬丈、片刻間、即成十五對五之比、約翰健兒因求勝心切、致犯規纍纍、主將許文奎即於是時被罰離塲、大勢遂不可為、上半時成三十三對九、下半時中、約翰陣容更見散漫、最後結果、成六十對二十二、觀昨賽海賊之表演、新將辟西爾、驍勇異常、其鋒芒不在卡遜之下、全隊表演較去年尤見整齊、</p>

<h3>九屆公展杯國際手球　中華保持冠軍</h3>
<p>兩循環之勝利均為中華所得　昨日雙打又以三對二敗西人</p>
<p>第九屆國際公展杯手球賽、第一循環為中華所勝、第二循環之單打賽中華又以七對三佔先、五組之雙打、中華祇需勝其一、即可奪得錦標、昨日五塲雙打、除朱寬與孫道勝組因孫君夫人病故棄權外、其他四塲均按時登塲、結果三對二中華果不負衆望、獲得勝利、本届錦標仍舊安然保持、此不得不歸功於各隊員之努力也、昨賽嚴兆容與黃克素不幸敗北、不然竟可全勝、</p>
<p>西人懦弱不堪不擊</p>
<p>第四組首先登塲、中華蔡同壽華岡鳳對西人客許納能可與列勃、蔡華聯絡佳妙、攻守合拍、西人受同壽之智取、鳳岡之勇猛、節節敗退、一籌莫展、故蔡華之勝來、亳不費力、西人眞不堪一擊、</p>
<p>嚴黃之敗十分可惜</p>
<p>來金與蓋司登為西人隊之健將、實力甚强、近來勤加練習、合作功夫、已凑佳境、華人嚴兆容與黃克素亦非弱者、聯絡已能入化、故兩雄相遇、戰來更形劇烈、比數至接近為從來所未見、然至緊要關頭之最後二分、嚴黃終失之交臂、以致見敗、可惜之至、</p>
<p>第二組賽戰爭劇烈</p>
<p>第二組由孫家綠何碩慶出塲、戰安德魯與斯密士、兩組實力相等、戰爭殊為劇烈、中華上塲後、氣勢極甚、以二十一對九之鉅數獲第一局、第二局安德魯與斯密士竭力反攻、臂殺每見得利、孫何亦報以顏色、惟失分太多、不幸失敗、第三局之生死關頭、孫何豈敢輕易放過、節節進攻、果獲勝利、</p>
<p>高孫勝於最後努力</p>
<p>高子受與孫寳琦之擊球、素稱精妙、聯絡亦佳、而西人克來滿和格禮納兩人、昨日打來每多險球對中華孫高、甚是旗鼓相當、比數亦茶接近、中華雖失第二局、但得力於最後之努力、勝利終歸孫高、茲將各組成績錄後、</p>
<p>第四組　蔡同壽　　鳳岡　二十一——十　二十一——四　客許納能可列勃</p>

<h3>國貨界之南洋考察團</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>南洋，為華僑彙集的區域，地面的廣闊，人口的繁多，富力的深厚，是很有悠久歷史的，加以僑胞愛國心的熱烈，和喜用國貨的心理，的確是國外暢銷國貨的最好市塲。本刋年來貢獻此意於國貨界，已非一次，而華僑中熱心國貨的，也是竭力鼓吹，荷印宋發祥總領事，便是最熱心的一人。勸告指導，不遺餘力。歷次在全國商會聯合會，上海市商會，中華國貨產銷合作協會，商榷討論，已有很完美的方法。最近出席中華工業國外貿易協會，報告在南提倡國貨的經過，來滬徵求各工廠出品，參加明年四月間開幕之南洋國貨巡迥展覽會，以求南洋貿易的擴大和發展。同時以此次新加坡國貨展覽會之成績，當地華僑，均說祖國工業有這樣的進步，出品有這樣的精良，個個表示歡迎，各廠運往的出品，全數銷罄，還覺有供不應求的氣象。故出席的國貨界同人聽了宋君的報告，一致認為各工廠對於南洋方面的宣傳和接洽，目前應該努力進行，因有組織南洋商業考察團的舉動，這是應着時勢的要求為國貨謀出路的根本方策。記者極盼其在國際貿易局與宋總領事指導之下，早日觀成，聯袂前往，此團此行的任務，就記者所見，應有如下的七點。</p>
<p>（一）宣述祖國國貨界的最近現狀，並各工廠的製造情形，能携帶各廠所攝的工業影片，前往開映，眞知灼見，尤覺印象深刻。</p>
<p>（二）考察南洋僑胞之生活情形，和他們日常所習用的品物，研究他們的心理和嗜好，以便製品時侯，投其所好，適合應用。</p>
<p>（三）考察南洋市塲的趨勢，和一般社會購買力的程度，以定貿易的步驟和方針</p>
<p>（四）考察南洋的貨幣與匯兌情形，以定物價的標準。</p>
<p>（五）考察南洋的運輸手續，和稅則的徵收標準，俾貨物的起運與送達，有一定的計算，不致失信僑胞。</p>
<p>（六）接洽南洋的販賣商和他們訂定經銷國貨的辦法。</p>
<p>（七）設立南洋國貨介紹听，以便僑胞的諮詢與採辦，並隨時任國內外通訊的責任。</p>
<p>最近交通部已應南洋華僑的請求，積極籌闢南洋航線，以便國貨流通。這件事與南洋國貨的發展，很有關係，目前雖需經費二千五百萬元之巨，可是以僑胞的愛國情殷，營業上極有把握，當然須早早實行的。</p>
<h3>中國化學工業社參觀記</h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>十一月二十七日下午二點鐘，我們拿了中國化學工業社的參觀証，六個人一同到上海檳榔路該社的廠房門前，招待我們是一位姓范的，談話非常詳細，印象非常之好。</p>
<p>我們先到製皂間，有幾隻大鍋子，正在煮脂肪，溶化後，再放在攪拌機內把鹼類溶液加入，再不停地攪拌，使脂肪鹼化。這便叫做皂漿，普通洗衣皂就是這種皂漿冷却後，放在木框內，印成商標就可以了。我們去時，他們正在做香皂，方法是把皂條切成薄片，再移入烘機把牠烘乾，再放入適當的顏料和香料，待牠完全勻和後，再壓成長條，於是放在軋印機內，軋成商標，就是了。</p>
<p>第二部份，我們到製牙膏和雪花膏的部份去，廠房很整潔，製牙膏的原料是炭酸鈉Na2Co3炭酸鈣CaCo，甘油（glycerineC3H5(OH)3……CH2（OH）-CH（OH）-CH2（OH）副料常用膠粉，酒精（CH7CH2OH）硼酸，糖漿等，香料用的是茴香油薄荷精，玫瑰精等。第一次手續是先煉膠，漸漸加熱，約相當時後，便移入軋膏機碾軋，使得成功黏稠如飴。第二步手續是裝罐，做這工作的須要三人，第一人把機伴一扳，把牙膏裝入錫罐裏，第二人接來，用機械把管底壓平，再把底邊捲轉，傳給第三人，然後加裝底夾，用機械打牢。這便是我們所買的一樣了。動作十分熟練，我們看了好一會見。</p>
<p>製雪花膏的原料是硬脂酸，炭酸鈉，炭酸鉀等物，最先是放入大鍋子內加熱，一面擣和，使其溶和成功糊狀，再放在大鉛桶中，用人工擣和，這時的顏色和形狀和普通所用的漿糊一般，並不美觀，於是在待其半冷時，放入香料，再把牠擣成勻和，便是雪花膏了，該廠出品有時代霜，芳澤脂，三星原質雪花膏等，市面上是十分流行的。</p>
<p>該廠出品除了上面三種之外，還有調味粉，（市上最普遍是「味生」和「觀音粉」（一種），醬油精，焦糖醬色，及蚊香，澱粉等出品，尤其是三星蚊香，我們在夏天裏差不多日常所接觸到的，差不多牠的足跡已到國內各小城市和鄉鎮，成為大衆的樂用品了。可惜我們沒有一一參觀到，這是引為遺憾的。</p>
<p>在中國化學工業社沒有創始之前，外國的貨品，充滿了國內市面，後來慢慢地給三星牌奪了過來。該社除了中國沒有的原料品，祇好向德國購買外，其餘都採用國貨，近年來營業發展，在上海的共有二個發行所，天津，杭州，南京，靑島等處又先後開設分店，全年營業額，約三百餘萬元。</p>
<p>參觀完了後，我們感到異常滿意。末了，我們對於殷股招待的范君，表示十分感激。</p>

<h3>言論自由的要求</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>國難後的中國，言論的不自由，簡直己變成一個無聲的中國。不但眞正的民意，未能充分表現，即各種內政外交的狀况，也不敢盡量披載。這結果，一般國民都給蒙在鼓裏，等待着亡國！</p>
<p>言論自由，本為國法所容許。邇來當局之所以對言論取監視的態度，當有其不得已的苦衷。但取締言論，應有明白辦法，規定一定的範圍，許人民以發表所見的機會，若言論果有越軌的地方，則加以禁止，自無不可。若一味箝制，速正確的評論也不許發，眞實的消息也不准載，便算過分的壓迫。這不惟有剝奪人民的言論自由，抑且於國家不利！</p>
<p>今日的中國，己臨於生死存亡的關頭。要救亡圖存，自非全國人一致奮起，共赴國難不可。但要人民救國，至少也應讓他們明白一點國事，及對國事發表一點意見。這便非開放言論不成。蓋自言論為一種有力的無形武器，政府的外交，沒有言論作後盾，是容易失敗的！</p>
<p>這次五全大會，一部分中委提出一開放新聞恢復言論案，這是極切要的。最近南京中央日報也有請當局變更新聞政策之論，可見言論自由，己為國人迫切的要求。該報社評結論云：「時局嚴重到今天，我們想到的初步根本補救辦法，是政府趕快改變新聞政策，黨部或政府主管新聞的機關，趕快應該與言論界商量一個簡明的辦法，明確的規定幾條嚴格的限制外，凡是關於危害國家的陰謀舉動及人物，毒害政治毀壞綱紀的各種事實及行為，人民愛國行為的表示及行動，尤其外國報紙的各種批評，及確為事實的記載，應請一律准許本國的報紙登載，這個辦法能够施行，我們相信三個月以後，我們內政及外交上的形勢，必能氣象一新，到那時候政府必能直接問接得着意想不到的力量，來輔助他推行各種政業刷新政治上的陣容，這决不是空談，更不是書生之見，十二萬分真誠祈禱當局即時採納這個意見，更希望全國言論界共同努力實現這個理想來報國。」這些話說得非常透澈！</p>
<p>我們在這裏向當局擔保，人民爭取言論自由，只有好意，决沒有惡意。人民要求言論自由，志在救國，絕不想害國。故我們希望政府能言念時艱，俯納民意，開放言論，使人民得到一個報國的機會。更願全國言論界起來努力，以期逮到實現言論自由的目的！</p>
<h3>讀「中國土地新方案」</h3>
<p>— 曾建屛</p>
<p>殷震夏著　正中書局出版</p>
<p>自閻錫山發表他的土地主張之後，國內各方面的學者，一時忽然都起來討論這個久已閒置着的問題。狠明顯的，土地問題，不論在什麼時候，始終是占着二千年來中國治亂的中心，是怎麽也不輕易給人棄置及廻避的。</p>
<p>但是，中國的土地問題，雖然非常重要，而書坊間對於這個問題之一般的著作，却甚為貧乏。因為書坊間對於這類書籍出版的貧乏，於是遂使商務所出版的『中國土地制度』及「中國土地叢考』，新生命所出版的『中國農村經濟研究」，「中國土地制度研究」『兩宋田賦制度』，以及黎明的『中國古代社會』，正中的『中國田制史』等等，成為目前一般研究中國土地問題的靑年的主要讀物。而同時，這些讀物，又多是關於中國過去各代的土地制度的研究，絕少觸到目前我們正在論爭的問題。然而正在鬧着缺乏這些書籍的時候，僥倖得很，殷震夏先生的「中國土地新方案，」却為筆者所讀到了。</p>
<p>首先我們要求承認殷震夏先生道一著作，是一本以很大的精力來完成的，而且是以闡明中山先生根本主張的著作。因為陳立夫先生給它序的時候，即說：「本土地方案乃能闡明均富之道，去寡貧之息，讀此當更瞭然於民生主義之偉大』。而安若定先生也以為。『披讀之下，對於土地之如何分畫，人口之如何支配，地制之如何改革，田賦之如何整……一一條分縷析，具有切實之辦法」。可見該書在其立論方面，確具有相當的正確性。</p>
<p>但，殷先生這一著作，雖原則上具有相當的正確性：而在筆者仔細閱讀之下，却認為尚有下列幾個應該討論的地方。例如：</p>
<p>第一：在該書第四章第二節『井田制度』裏面，作者在引用杜佑通典所載：『昔黃帝始經土設井，以塞爭端，立步制畝，以防不足，，使人家為井，井開四道，……迄乎夏殷不易其制』之後，即無疑問地斷言：『此為黃帝時代的井田制度『黃帝井田之制，是採大農經營，八家共同生產，共同分配……』。同時更引孟子所說的「八家皆私百畝」及其所引詩經之「雨我公田，遂及我私」一語，因而斷定周時的土地制度，是由黃帝之「共有公營遽變為周初以迄春秋之『共有公營』。這種肯定的態度，是我們所不敢同意的。</p>
<p>因為杜佑的通典關於黃帝時代田制之記載，可謂完全是由於附會孟子的意見而偽造出來的。這種材料之不可靠，識者早有定評，而且所謂黃帝時代，在歷史上乃是中國之初期氏族社會。氏族社會之共同占有土地，乃是土地私有的第一種形式。這種土地的占有形式下，即使是採取農村公社的形式來經營當時的土地，也决不能有所謂『八家』共同生產共同分配之制度產生。但是殷先生在本書中，却無疑問的予以肯定的判斷，這是我們所不敢同意的。</p>
<p>第二：周代以至春秋，我們也不能認那時的土地制度，是無條件的「共有私營」。因為周初以至春秋，中國的社會，己經由民族社會而漸走入封建社會的時代。封建的地主貴族所形成的國家握有土地，乃是土地私有的第二種形式。那時的統治者，旣然不斷地爭田奪地，並以土地不斷地賜其臣僕；那麼，我們又何能斷定春秋以前的土地共有制之存在！故殷先生對於中國古代田制之引述，不能採用較新的理論及考證，徒信古人古書，遽下斷語，我們也是不敢贊同的。</p>
<p>第三：作者在該書第四章第七節「均田制度」中之犯了一個錯誤。他所引的「男子授田四十畝，名曰倍田，女子授田二十畝名曰露田」。這一點，與事實不符。因為元魏九年的均田令，明明說：「諸男夫十五以上，受露田四十畝：婦人二十畝。…所授之田，率倍之：三易之田，再倍之。以供耕作，及授受之盈縮」。（見魏書食貨志）可見當時一個男夫所受之四十畝，乃是露田，而非倍田。所謂倍田，乃是當時在桑田露田之外的附加田。是以地之良惡為增减的。今作者乃以每男夫所受之四十畝為倍田，顯係與當時事實不符。這是筆者敢請作者注意的。</p>
<p>第四：作者在其第四章十五節的「結論」裏，也同樣重複着上述的錯誤，他說：「總合以上所述歷代的土地制度，概括言之，可以分為五個時期：（一）土地公有公營時期，三代以前。（二）土地公有私營時期，自三代至周末。（三）土地私有時期，自戰國至南北朝。（四）土地國有中興期，自後魏孝文帝至唐代中葉…」。（見該書四六頁）這一結論，在我看起來，也是不大妥當的。因為所謂土地國有，本來是土地私有制度的第二種形式。元魏至唐之所謂土地國有，實際上乃是當時的封建地主貴族的私有，與現代所謂土地國有的內容完全不同。當時各代貴族強豪之占有廣大土地，貴族地主莊園制度之存在，以及皇帝之不斷以大量的土地賜予權臣，均足證明中國在元魏至唐代不能有什麽土地國有制度，更不能有什麼土地國有的中興期。作者在本書却把這種一國有土地」與「私有土地」對立起來，顯然在方法論上是有點不正確的。</p>
<p>第五：同時，作者其下編第六章，也犯了一個小小的毛病。即是作者在徽引各種統計統計未證明中國本部各省耕地减少之後，即結論說：「豫，鄂，湘，贛，粵五省農地農戶的劇烈减縮，大概受A天災，B匪禍，C政治不良，D農村經濟衰落等影響；致農民無法維持，逃避死亡，因此己耕晨地各任其荒棄一。（見八（買）這一結論，無疑的，是輕輕把帝國主義者對於中國的侵略，因而加深了中國的天災人禍及造成了中國的政治不安這一主要的因素抹煞了。假使如作者所說一樣，則很容易使讀者把上述諸原因看成中國自發的現象，與帝國主義無關。那麽，不是輕輕地放過了一個最大的罪魁了嗎？</p>
<p>關於這一點，筆者希望殷先生能在其第二版時予以修正。</p>
<p>總之，「中國土地新方案」這一本書，其下編是比較勝於十親。因為上編比較重於理論，下編比較重於實際。作者在其第六章以後，尤其是在農村耕地的改革這一方面，曾給我們提出許多切實的辦法：故在目前中國土地制度問題已經從理論迫於實際的時候，這本書還是可以一讀的。</p>
<h3>讀中國郵政上卷</h3>
<p>— 莊心在</p>
<p>張標任著　商務書館出版</p>
<p>眼前中國革命已從吶喊的過程，進展到實幹的過程，破壞的工作己需要建設的工作來替代。不必說中國為當世各國所稱揚贊許的，全在於近年來堅苦奮鬥創立的種種實際成績：就說是要使中國邁進了現代式新國家，也亟待於棟種新事業的舉辦推行。近百年來，中國革命工作，所最足以具體表現者，實際還在於交通事業方面，而交通事業中，成績彰明卓著者，則首推郵政。說起郵政，簡直同衣，食，住，行一樣平常，與人民日常生活保有密切的關係，誰不曉得郵政是傳遞信件的機關，誰不和郵的發生直接聯繫，誰不知道郵政是花中國辦理得最好的新事業。但是進一步問郵政辦理成績好在何處？比較關心的人士，會曉得郵政事業之為中外稱譽，原因在於組織之完整嚴密，足為全國最富於統一性的行政機關；用人之考覆精審，足稱最適合歐美文官制度的精神：辦事之敏捷可靠，而富於責任心，足以為談行政效率的模範：而且郵政事業實能使人民以最低的犧牲來獲取最大的享受，可說是最合於福利主義的一種新事業。這些話誠然很對，可是如果再進一步問中國郵政為什麼能造成這樣的成績和令譽？恐怕誰也瞠目不知所對，但是郵政成績之卓著，又豈是偶然倖致的呢？</p>
<p>年來中國朝野上下頗知努力於交通事業，但交通事業之長足推進，必先使人民對於交通事業其有充分的知識，才能知利用之方，而盡愛護之責。譬如說郵政：論歷史，試辦迄今垂六十餘年，論範圍，自廣大都市以至於窮鄉僻壞，遍及於全國：論與人民之關係，又最為普遍，最為密切重要。然而迄未有專篇鉅著，對此作系統之叙述，俾人民對之有眞確之認識，而明郵政辦理成績所以良好之方，即他項新事業之舉行，亦可因以獲良好之借鏡，實在是新國家新事業創建中的一大憾事。但是現在，這件缺憾却以張著中國郵政的出版而得以補足了。</p>
<p>中國郵政全書約五十萬言，分為上中下三卷，上卷已於最近出版，共分四編十七章，專論中國郵政之行政部門者。翻閱一過，本書於郵政之過去沿革，溯源窮委，確實詳明；於現行組織，縱的統屬橫的連繫，及其購態運用權限任務，無不有精密深湛之觀察，不僅止於表面之析述介紹而己。至於人員之任用，薪給，攷績班次，獎懲，職責，退休等等一一詳為叙述，剖析入微，且繩之以人事行政方面之學理，以衡其得失；末篇詳論郵務人員團體之組織及其功能以為之殿。各種法令，規章，舉凡有關於郵政者，窮披力索，無不具備。讀了這樣一本關於中國郵政的鉅著，不能不想到著者所耗精力之可觀了。（未完）</p>
<p>本書著者張樑任先生以留德經濟學博士，歸國服務交通郵政行政機關多年，而且曾親與郵政法規之修訂，自然像這樣專門性質的鉅著，必得要學識與經騐兩臻豐富的作者來執筆，方能將學理與事實雙方並顧，融會貫通，而不致有浮泛空疎或是枯燥膚淺的弊病。</p>
<p>讀了本書以後，我發了三點感想：第一凡事决無倖致之理，中國郵政事藥成績之優越，自有她能够優越的原因，這原因便在於郵政行政組織方面，動靜機搆嚴密合理，而能依軌道內靈活運行，人員方面，選用待遇種種都能使人人盡其材用，安心致力於公務的發展。第二，郵政的成績所昭示於我人者可以推論及之於其他事業，甚至於政府，機關，如果欲求事業進行之經濟合理，效率增加，富責任，少浪費，不能不於行政組織機搆及人員之任用待遇種種方面三致意焉。因此本書不但是中國郵政事業行政方面的唯一有系統的典籍，而且在謀管理完善合理使事業發達的人士，以及留心行政機關組織與人事行政之改善的人士，中國郵政一畫，都是最有價值的實鑑。第三點，我因此覺中國的出版事業很有進展的希望，逐漸能够向着比較專門件質深入研究方面進步，而不再以社會學概論政治學總論之類，教科書本自限。由此更希望出版界有更多的性質上比較專門而涉及於本國新事業的各方面有系統的著述收獲，這將於新中國的創建，有無限的裨助。</p>
<p>以上僅僅就披覽中國郵政上卷以後想到要說的話。中卷專論郵政業務，下卷專論郵政經濟，我很熱烈的希望能早日出版，以完成中國郵政事業整個的要典。</p>
<h3>書店雜景（續）</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>（七）校對員</p>
<p>在新書店的編輯中，除了總編輯以外，我們不提其他人員而即說校對員的緣故，是因為校對這一件工作比較不為人注意，而事實上却很有趣而重要。書業中人當然知道校對是怎樣的一回事，但業外人也許知道得不多。所以，我得先告訴你，所謂校對，簡單的說，便是在書籍排印的過程中，根據原稿，改正印刷所送來，已排好而尚未印好的未定稿。這工作不是很簡單嗎？於是在新書業發生的初期，各書店中由校對而發生的趣事，眞是太多了。</p>
<p>「校對」可以說比「剪報」還難的一件工作。剪報，不是很容易的嗎，有什麼難呢？但根據有過剪報經騐的人的報告，最初是沒有不失敗的。譬如，第一你得知道材料的取捨，第二又得知道材料的分類，這種工作要是由沒有經騐的人來做，就是你告訴他那段新聞要剪他也曾祇剪前一段，把刊在另版或另行的下半段忘了，校對的情形固然不同，但其困難，在原則上實是一樣。</p>
<p>沒有經騐的書店老闆（或總經理，總編輯，總之，是負責人），以為校對是易事，起初大多不肯出較高的錢去請校對員，有的甚至即命學徙担任，以致新書中錯誤百出，一般著作家，有的不滿意別人的校對，又以為校對是易事，常要求書店把稿件自校，結果比較書店中學徒所校對的還糟。校對似乎多少有些神秘的事，學力欠缺，文字程度欠佳的人，以為校對袛須一字一字地對照就得，自然會錯得不堪設想，反之，就是由原著者來校對，在其校對的時候，覺得很滿意了，但待書出版後，也會錯得連自己都不能相信，有的甚至以為是印刷所改錯了。</p>

<h3>美飛機「中國號」橫渡太平洋成功</h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>最近在太平洋上有一件使人注目的事情，便是美國大飛機「中國號」橫渡的成功。這飛機共有引擎四架，馬力每引擎八百匹，載重五萬一千磅。從美國西海岸阿拉麥達起飛，經檀香山，半程島威克島及關島，而飛抵菲律賓的馬尼剌港。全程共八千哩僅飛五日之時間，這可說是太平洋自有交通以來第一次的壯舉。所以美國人民對此舉予以極大的鼓舞歡欣，而世界各國也都予以非常的注視了。</p>
<p>就科學對於人類的利益說，這件事是非常值得人類贊美的。人類在科學上的發展與利用，原是以增進人類幸福為目的。像這次「中國號、橫渡太平洋，把太平洋本來很遼遠的交通，大大縮短，很迅速的促進了世界人羣的密切聯繫關係，這對於人羣的幸福是很大的。不獨這件事如此，卽是其他方面，像炸藥可用以開闢礦藏和峻險的山路，毒氣可用以殺菌及其他醫學上農業上之應用等等，卽是人們認為最危險的東西，只要利用的目的不錯，都於人類有益。至於飛機無綫電等於人類有益，更不必說了。現在却無辜被少數自私自利者利用了去。於是，本來於人有益的一切東西，就樣樣都變成有害於人類的毒物了。像飛機用以拋擲炸彈，炸藥和毒氣用以為大規模殺人的利器，輪船可以改造成戰艦，而無綫電更可作為軍用，無綫電發明的老祖馬可尼，並且已跟着墨索里尼去帮助他到非洲做殺人的劊子副手去了。這許多事件，都可見現代的科學，正在怎樣被一些自私者利用了作害人的事業。卽如這次美國飛機「中國號」的橫渡太平洋，美國政府的動機，是否在促進太平洋交通着想，我們無從懸猜，但是在再開海軍會議備聲中，日本已老實對於此事發出不滿意的抗議了。在「中國號」經過的空中路綫中，我們可以聞到了很濃重的火藥氣味的。</p>
<p>只有站在「受害地位的人羣合力起來，對少數自私者抗戰，把本是有益於人羣的一切科學利器，從他們獨佔的毒手中，奪回過來，然後人羣才可以利用一切科學，來重行替人羣造福。而中國人民，在這一使命上，更負有最大的責任，原來，中國民衆，現在是世界上「受害」最深的一羣人民，美國橫渡太平的洋大飛機，所以要命名為「中國號」，正是暗示着這個嚴重的意義在內了。</p>
<h3>南國雜憶</h3>
<p>— 璜</p>
<p>每天淸早，當滿含寒意的秋風吹進小樓來時，每每帶着一陣陣悲壯的喇叭聲，間或雜着得得的蹄聲同沙沙的整齊的步調。這時候，我的心亦就隨着它一齊陰沉起來了。</p>
<p>「又有人的性命要完結了！」我聽到這不吉利的聲音時就這樣想。有時更不自覺地走近樓前，憑欄俯望，下面那整齊的行列—一個仗旗的人走在前頭十幾個步兵隨在後面，他們槍桿上雪白的刺刀在朝陽中閃耀着。再次就是待刑的人了，他們有些是坐在洋車上，有些是坐在一二個人槓着竹筐里，有的却是自己走路。行列的最後就是監刑的長官，騎在一匹矮小的馬匹上。</p>
<p>過路的人有的偶而駐足看看，不過大多是翻過臉去，不願意看一看這些在人世上只有幾分鐘或十幾分鐘的彌留的人們。</p>
<p>在幾年之前，這樣的行列的後面，時常是簇擁着一些閒人，嘴里不停地嚷着：「看打靶去呀！看打靶去呀！」可是現在，這光景也少見了。是習慣了呢？還是旁的什麼原因呢？我不知道。不過，入秋以來，正在辦冬防的時候，喇叭聲又時常隨着晨風吹到這小樓來了。</p>
<p>我怕看那些灰白的臉孔，我怕看他們臨死的戰顫，我更怕看那凄絕的眼光！是他們向人世所投射的最後的一瞥！</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>我更加怕看追在他們後面號嚎着的人們—是他們的父母，兄弟，妻子，親戚，或友朋，那種死別的凄凉的哭聲，聽了叫人腸斷。</p>
<p>願他們！」我時常要為這般死者祝福，假如有上帝的話，我要代他們祈禱，因為他無論如何，總是我們的同胞呀！但我時常只唸到「願他們！」這三個字而已，我說不出以下的請來，因為他們是被稱為盜同匪的人呵！</p>
<h3>銀練</h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>每次回到家里時，我的六歲的孩子總是翹起了嘴唇問：「爸，帶什麽東西來給我吃哪?」</p>
<p>一聽到這姣小的聲音，我的那顆申年的心兒癮疼了。我想着：為什麼我沒有東西給他吃吓？—先前，當我有着一份職業的時候，我時常為我的孩子們買餅乾，巧克力，杏仁糖去滿足他們的食慾的。可是，現在呢，我貧窮了，我失業了；他們非但吃不到那些甜美的餅乾，就是一天三餐也不能使他們吃飽呵。</p>
<p>三歲的女孩，，時常為了飢餓而啼哭。而，六歲的孩子却時常帶了一副奇怪的神情來觀看我。</p>
<p>有一天，我正悶沉地在寫一對找職業的自薦書時，那六歲的孩？揹有書包回來了。</p>
<p>「爸，我回來了。」他歡喜地跟我說着。</p>
<p>「今天書背得出嗎？」我隨口問他。</p>
<p>他笑了笑，點頭，跳躍地走到他的媽那兒去了。</p>
<p>我繼續寫着我的信，忽然他又來了，他帶着一副沒有笑的臉兒的我：</p>
<p>「為什麼在這麽多的日子中，你一些東西也不買給我們吃哪？爸。」</p>
<p>我苦笑了，我幾乎從苦笑中流出眼淚來。我沒有什麽可以回答他，我只是向他苦笑，苦笑……</p>
<p>妻拿了兩塊餅，抱着三歲的女孩子進來了。她問我肚飢不，她把那女孩子交給我抱，她輕輕地跟我說：</p>
<p>「今天在箱橱抽屜里，找到一根金練條！</p>
<p>「唔，那是銀的呵！那是我爸爸給我的呵！……」我猶疑着，我對於那根我的父親給我的銀練條不知道應該如何處置。</p>
<p>「媽吓，我肚子餓，那兩個餅給我吃了吧！」</p>
<p>於是妻就把那兩塊餅交給了剛從學校里回來的孩子。然而，倚在我懷里的孩子忽然哭起來了。她叫着：</p>
<p>「我也要吃……媽…」</p>
<p>我聽到這種飢餓的擾紛時，就從猶疑中抬起頭來，沉痛地對妻說：</p>
<p>「讓我拿那根銀練條去變換錢吧，反正窮苦人是沒有留藏紀念物的福份的。」</p>
<p>我立刻走到箱橱那兒，從抽屜裏拿出了那根塗着金的銀練條。心里忖着：</p>
<p>「牠至多只能維持我們二天的肚餓呵！」</p>
<h3>馬鞍山麓</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>悶鬱於都市炭酸氣的沉重生活中，祗須偶然嗅着一些草和泥土氣息，便會如喝了蘇打水暖氣般的鬆暢起來，何况，在靑松株株，一灣碧色的溪水，滿山散佈着紅葉的初冬田野的自然景色中呢！黃色石子和靑色碎磚相互舖成小徑的無規律圖案，籬笆裏面爬出錯綜的南瓜籐，大葉子下面躺着怕風的硃色老南瓜，有着一種充實豐滿之欣悅灌輸於旅者的情戚中。</p>
<p>我們揮動手裏的山柴枝，　　美妙的，輕鬆，淡澹的牧歌，而踱過了低矮的柴門。在我們背後，頓有了無數奇覺的目光，跟隨着，跟隨着，直等我們把歌聲帶過了半月形的古石橋，於是，才從黃色乾癟的嘴唇裏吐出「上海客人哪！」這句枯澀的話，於是，又贊進那點低矮的破瓦屋裏去了。</p>
<p>薄薄的白雲慢慘地在銀杏樹梢上移動着。步子是失意者的帶着鬱沉的彳亍。連白雲亦感覺着悶損嗎，人們以為你在那廣闊無涯一片蔚藍的天空，是儘可自由自在地趕完你的路程的……而你却，你却寗願浸沉於冷冷的漬流中，讓幾個不懂事的鄉童蹲在溪岸上向水而扔着尖角的碎瓦片，甚至被一羣鴨的爪劃破了你的冷冷的靜靜的容顏。一塊渙散了，另外一塊又徐徐地過來。</p>
<p>能整塊不改變形態而飄過山嶺的就却很少很少。能在人生旅送上，不受生活巨風的摧阻，而走至盡頭的，當亦是一樣，一樣很少吧？呵呵，有多少旅途的夥伴，有多少幸福的結合，未至中，途就那麼苦惱地走散了，走散了。馬鞍山空際的白雲呵，暮年的白髮蘆葦亦在對你搖頭而嘆息了。</p>
<p>滿山紅葉在中午溫暖的陽下貶着金色的眸子，褐色的眸子，呈現着悵惘之色。半山的古庵屋頂上逗息着幾隻白鴿和灰鴿，時或飛起在黑色的屋脊上打一迴旋又息下，牠們沒有遠走高飛的意念，或許牠們就生活在那古庵裏，小小的禽鳥尚不忍離開古舊的巢穴，常年懷着家鄕病約我，不禁亦因此而被挑起一些哀愁之感了。</p>
<p>在寺塔松，美人蕉，雜色菊，光禿的梅技，所綴誠的園林中，大家都跌坐於點綠夾着灰黃的草坪上，而我却獨喜那隻冷陰的石櫈，他們在預計着一個歸去的時間，和一班比較空閒的火車，「呵，多麽忙碌急忽的蠢俗者啊。」我這樣暗暗咒詛着我的夥伴。可是再轉念一想，我錯了，他們是都有着家室在外邊的，不像我獨處着硬把烟捲薰黃了父母所賜賦與我指甲。我又何嘗不想歸去呢？祇因我的家太遠了，太遠了。我不能離開生活的牢棚！</p>
<p>太陽雖那麽好，可總照不進我陰黯而冷冷的心坎。我有着紅葉的悵惘，白蘆的暮年戚…可是，我是年輕的人哪，為什麼不比擬着那些挺秀的靑松呢？為什麼不比擬那塊雄偉的岩石呢？「弱！弱！」這譏駡似乎就從靑松岩石上激過來的。我眞受不了。我恨命地抽着烟捲。</p>

<h3>Decisions of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee: Date for Convening the National Assembly</h3>
<p>—November 12, Year 25—</p>
<p>May 5 of Next Year: Announce Draft Constitution</p>
<p>Establish a Constitution Draft Review Committee Composed of 19 Designated Individuals</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee held its second meeting at 9:00 AM on the 4th. Attendees included Executive Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Feng Yuxiang, Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Zou Lu, and others, totaling eighty individuals. Alternate Executive Committee members Wu Kaixian, Xue Dubi, and others, totaling forty-two individuals, were also present. Supervisory Committee members Lin Sen, Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Jingheng, and others, totaling twenty-four individuals, were present. Alternate Supervisory Committee members Lu Dangping, Lei Zhen, and others, totaling twenty individuals, were also present. Ju Zheng served as chairman, and Ye Chucong served as secretary-general.</p>
<p>Reporting Items: (1) Reading of the minutes of the first meeting; (2) Secretary-General's Office report on documents: A. Two letters from committee members; B. Four congratulatory telegrams.</p>
<p>Discussion Items: (1) The Presidium proposed the date for convening the National Assembly and the method for announcing the draft constitution. 1. Announce the draft constitution of the Republic of China on May 5, Year 25; convene the National Assembly on November 12; the election of representatives to the National Assembly should be completed before October 10. 2. Establish a Constitution Draft Review Committee composed of 19 members designated by the Presidium to be responsible for reviewing the draft and for formulating amendments to proposals deemed worthy of adoption by the assembly within two months, to be submitted to the Standing Committee for delivery to the Legislative Yuan for further revisions. This committee may appoint several experts for consultation. 3. The law on the organization of the National Assembly and the law on the election of representatives should be submitted to the Review Committee to draft principles, which should be submitted to the Standing Committee for prompt deliberation and promulgation. The members of the Review Committee are Ye Chucong, Li Wenfan, Zhou Fohai, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Luyi, Liang Hancao, Wang Shijie, Chen Bulei, Shao Yuanchong, Liu Luyin, Fu Bingchang, Wang Yongbin, Peng Xuepei, Wu Jingxiong, Chen Gongbo, Mao Zuquan, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Zhiben, and Le Jingtao. Ye Chucong and Li Wenfan are the conveners. Resolution passed. (2) Ju Zheng, Chiang Kai-shek, Feng Yuxiang, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Zou Lu, Ding Weifen, and other seven committee members proposed that the Standing Committee and the National Government should inform all comrades and the people of the country about the purpose of this currency reform. The original proposal stated: "The disorder of our country's currency system has been long-standing. Since the late Qing Dynasty, there have been calls for reform, but it has never been implemented. In addition, the global economic recession in recent years has affected our country. The market is depressed, and industry and commerce are declining. The international market price of silver has soared, and a large amount of silver has flowed out of the country. The financial situation has become increasingly panicked. The silver and money industries are in a precarious situation, and economic collapse is imminent. In order to thoroughly rectify the currency system, restrict the outflow of silver, stabilize the market and financial situation, and regulate social capital, the Ministry of Finance has resolutely planned to reform the current monetary system, announced the suspension of the use of silver and unified issuance methods on November 4, and reported it to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee, which was accepted by the assembly. Since January, the domestic implementation has been quite smooth, and friendly countries have also expressed their support and are making every effort to implement it. In the future, the national economy can move from security to improvement. It is proposed that the assembly hand over the reform of the currency system and the stabilization of financial measures to the Central Standing Committee and the National Government to inform all party members and the people of the country, so that they can understand the purpose of this currency reform, which focuses on concentrating reserves and consolidating currency confidence. All rumors of expanding currency and indiscriminate issuance of banknotes are not credible. Only in this way can we work together to promote it without hindrance. Under the guidance of the government, national economic construction can be revived through self-reliance and struggle. Is this appropriate? Please vote on it." Resolution: Passed. (3) The four groups of the proposal review committee, Party Affairs, Politics, Economy, and Education, reported on the review of the cases submitted by the Fifth National Congress. Result: Resolution: All passed according to the review opinions. Adjourned at 11:00 AM. (Report from the Central News Agency on the 4th)</p>

In general, the fourth meeting will be held on the morning of the 6th to elect the responsible persons of the central party and government. The meeting can be closed in the afternoon of the 6th. (Report from the Central News Agency on the 4th)</p>
<p>The Party Affairs Group Studies Various Proposals</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The various proposal review groups of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee have generally reviewed the proposals submitted by the Fifth National Congress. However, the Party Affairs Group needs to specifically review the organization of the Central Party Headquarters and various party affairs work. Therefore, Chen Lifu, Chen Gongbo, Wang Luyi, Fang Zhi, Hong Lanyou, Xu Enzeng, Shi Zizhou, Gu Zhenggang, Yu Jingtang, Zhou Qigang, Wu Kaixian, and other eleven committee members were specially appointed to conduct preliminary research.

<p>The First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee Will Not Issue a Declaration</p>

<p>Shandong Residents in Beijing Request Major Plans</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shandong Residents Association in Beijing telegraphed the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee on the 4th, requesting consideration of the crisis in North China and the rapid formulation of major plans. The original telegram stated: "To the First Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China: Since the traitor Yin Rugeng betrayed the Party and the country, and ordinary traitors are thinking of using his name to disrupt North China, such retrograde acts are extremely heinous. All of us, descendants of Yan and Huang, are unanimously indignant and swear to oppose them to the death. Now that all the central officials are gathered together, we earnestly request that you consider the crisis in North China and quickly formulate major plans so that territorial sovereignty will not be lost again. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. The Shandong Residents Association in Beijing bows its head. (Report from the Central News Agency on the 4th)</p>

<h3>Ross Leaves Beiping and Heads South</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Lees-Ross has completed his inspection in Beiping and is scheduled to head south on the 5th. He will visit our authorities in Nanjing to discuss matters. (Report from the Central News Agency on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Amidst the Development of the Situation, the Situation in North China Gradually Stabilizes. Chen Xiong and Others Had Important Discussions Yesterday. The Final Approval Will Be Made by He and Song. The New Administrative Organization Will Be Realized Soon.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since He Yingqin went north to North China, he has indeed brought a plan to deal with and resolve the situation. On the external front, Chen Yi and Xiong Shihui, who came to Beiping with He, have made considerable progress after conducting preliminary contacts in Beiping and Tianjin for several days. On the internal front, He summoned Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and others last night to discuss how to deal with the internal temporary problems and exchange opinions. There are also preliminary solutions. Chen, Xiong, Qin, and Xiao held another meeting at a certain place this afternoon to conduct important discussions on the situation, hoping to obtain appropriate solutions, and then He and Song will make the final review and implementation. Chen is scheduled to go to Tianjin again if necessary. (Special Dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiong Shihui and Chen Yi held a meeting with Xiao Zhenying and Qin Dechun at Jurentang this afternoon to have important discussions on the situation, hoping to find a suitable solution in the absence of a solution, and then He Yingqin and Song Zheyuan will make the final decision. (Special Dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After He Yingqin arrived in Beiping last night, he telegraphed Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, and Qin Dechun at 10:00 PM to have an important meeting. Xiong Shihui and Chen Yi were also present. The meeting did not end until late at night. A certain important Japanese guest who has been staying in Beiping for a long time has not seen He for a long time and is scheduled to visit him this afternoon to discuss everything. It is heard that He has a definite way to deal with the situation. After sincere contact with all relevant parties, it can be concretized. All parties are optimistic. (Special Dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After He Yingqin arrived in Beiping, the situation in North China has become optimistic. It is expected that the so-called autonomous movement can be resolved peacefully. He will follow the example of the Mongolian Autonomous Council to establish an administrative organ called the North China Committee to manage the five provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, Shanxi, and Suiyuan. Song Zheyuan will be the first chairman. It is expected that the association will be established before the end of this week. This time, the North China authorities dealt with the Japanese military authorities with resolute diplomatic means, which has gradually aroused an impression. Since He arrived in Beiping, this impression can be even more profound. It is heard that the representative of the Chinese authorities met with Doihara yesterday and felt that his attitude was more moderate than before. Last night, He had a secret talk with the main Chinese military authorities here for a long time, but the result is unknown. The most important thing is that Japanese military officer Takahashi and Song Zheyuan had a meeting yesterday, which lasted for an hour. The content is unknown, but it is heard that important negotiations were conducted. When He arrived here from Baoding yesterday, in addition to Chinese dignitaries, there were also diplomatic corps staff and many foreigners at the station to welcome him. (Report from Reuters on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan went to Jurentang last night to meet He Yingqin to explain the current situation and ask him to forward it to the Central Government to quickly show effective measures. Song met with reporters at his private residence this afternoon and said that there is no concrete way to deal with the current situation in Hebei so far. The Central Government sent He Yingqin north, and he personally felt that his responsibility had been reduced a lot. Regarding the situation in Hebei, he has telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to detail everything. Similar incidents of independence and autonomy by Yin Rugeng and disturbances in Dacheng and Jinghai have also been reported to Chiang. As for the current situation in Hebei, it cannot be achieved by empty words. He hopes that the government will quickly set effective measures. He personally obeys the Central Government in everything. (1) Do not succumb to others. (2) Obey the guidance of the Central Government. Under the leadership of He, deal with everything and fulfill personal responsibility to the country. He visited He last night and explained in detail the various situations from the time he left Zhangjiakou until now. Regarding the solution to the entire current situation, Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying are now discussing concrete measures in detail with Chen Yi and Xiong Shihui. (Special Dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan told reporters on the afternoon of the 4th that Minister He resolutely came to Beiping at a time when there was no way to deal with North China, which made him very happy, and the people of North China were also greatly relieved. He believes that a large country will eventually have a final solution in times of crisis. Recently, people in the society have been quite ignorant of him. In fact, the current meetings between the two sides are only private exchanges of opinions, and neither can represent the country, because neither side has been entrusted by the country. As for the results of the exchange of opinions, it is only a temporary reference. Therefore, the final decision still needs to be made by the Central Government. He has great faith in Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, because he is indeed the only leader of China. When he visited Minister He on the evening of the 3rd, he reported in detail the environment of the 29th Army and the current difficult situation. In the future, if Minister He takes office as the new head of the Executive Yuan in Beiping, he will take up the new post of Director of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Office, otherwise, he will not be able to bear the heavy responsibility of North China. The current issue is being carefully studied by the two chairmen, Chen Yi and Xiong Shihui, and Qin and Xiao. After concrete results are obtained, Minister He and he will make the final discussion. (Report from the Central News Agency on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan told guests today that he is loyal to the Central Government and will never succumb to external forces. The situation in North China can be resolved soon. Chen Yi, Xiong Shihui, and Qin Dechun are about to draft a plan, which will be finalized by him and He Yingqin. He is very pleased that He has come to Beiping, because his responsibility has been reduced a lot. If He takes the post of Commissioner of the Executive Yuan, he can reconsider taking up the post of Director of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Office. Song's statement is considered by the public to be a realistic expression of the optimism and trust that arose in the political circles after He's arrival in Beiping last night. The saying that the central government's proposals brought by He Yingqin, Chen Yi, and Xiong Shihui can be accepted by the Japanese side is becoming more and more credible. It is believed that the agency in North China, which is similar to the Mongolian Autonomous Committee, will peacefully resolve the dispute. Japanese planes have not been to Beiping for several days, but three Japanese planes flew around He Yingqin's residence this morning to show off. (Report from Reuters on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After He Yingqin arrived in Beiping, a telegram arrived in Nanjing on the 4th, reporting to the Central Government on the situation of arriving in Beiping from Baoding, and the discussions with generals such as Shang Zhen, Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, and Qin Dechun. The generals expressed their satisfaction. It is heard that the negotiations have also eased. The Central Government telegraphed on the 4th to instruct everything at any time. Shang Zhen telegraphed Nanjing on the 4th in the morning and afternoon to report on the local situation. As soon as his illness improves, he will go to Beiping to meet with He, Song, and Xiao Qin. Chen Yi and Xiong Shihui also telegraphed Nanjing separately, and the content was generally the same as what He Yingqin reported. It is also heard that a certain country is ready to negotiate frankly with our side and does not insist on unilateral prejudices, but there is no information on the extent of the limit. As of now, the Japanese army on the Beining Line has not started moving. (Special Dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After He Yingqin and Chen Yi arrived in Beiping, there is hope for the development of the overall situation in North China, and the people of Tianjin are becoming more and more stable. Although there are many rumors in the city, no one believes them. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 4:00 PM on the 4th, Cheng Ke, accompanied by Secretary-General Sun Runyu, went to Beiping to meet He Yingqin. According to reports, they will stay in Beiping for two or three days and then return to Tianjin. This trip is to respond to Minister He's call to discuss the overall strategy. Tianjin has made strict preparations for public security to prevent other incidents. Liu Yushu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, has been instructed to take responsibility. (Special Dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to the current hope for the situation in North China to turn around, the traitors feel that there is no hope for activities and are gradually becoming negative. (Special Dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Actions in China Apparently Violate the Nine-Power Treaty; Our Ambassador Urges Britain and the United States to Pay Attention; London and Washington Plan Close Liaison</h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi visited British Foreign Secretary Hoare today, urging him to pay attention to the extremely serious nature of Japan's significant diplomatic and military pressure on China outside of North China. Ambassador Quo stated that Japan's actions not only violate the Nine-Power Treaty but also infringe upon the League of Nations Covenant, for which Britain has obligations. Hoare responded with sympathy, saying that talks are currently underway between London and Washington regarding this issue. The British Chargé d'affaires in Tokyo was recently instructed to inquire at the Japanese Foreign Ministry about everything. British political circles have so far refrained from commenting on these talks. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to information obtained by our correspondent, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, visited Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare today and explained that Japan's actions in North China violate the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty, urging the British government to pay attention.

<h3>Hu Hanmin Discusses the Situation with a Dutch Reporter: Japan's Economic Cooperation with Us Lacks Sincerity; Why Does the League of Nations Neglect Events in the Far East?</h3>
<p>Batavia, China United Press: According to a Dutch newspaper, a Dutch reporter from Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant asked the Chinese politician Hu Hanmin for his opinion on the political situation. Mr. Hu responded as follows (the questioner is the Dutch reporter, and the respondent is Mr. Hu):</p>
<p>(Question) What are your thoughts on the current situation in Europe and the League of Nations? (Answer) Are you asking for my personal opinion? I am very sorry, but I dare not trust the League of Nations. Why is it that the League of Nations imposed sanctions on Italy for attacking Abyssinia, but it has not adopted concrete measures regarding China? (Question) What are your thoughts on Japan's recent proposal for economic cooperation with your country? (Answer) At present, Japan still does not respect the independence and equal rights of the Chinese nation and is even trying to resolve economic issues together with political and military matters, which shows a lack of sincerity. (Question) Does that mean that you intend to reject Japan's cooperation? (Answer) How can you say that? China certainly needs cooperation, but it will never allow only one country to cooperate; it needs joint investment from all countries that treat us equally. (Question) In your opinion, how can cooperation with Japan be achieved? (Answer) As I said before, we must first stand on an equal footing before we can talk about cooperation. Now, Japanese troops are stationed inside and outside the Great Wall, and Manchuria has a large army. Can we say that our positions are equal? (Question) Do you also want China to open its doors? (Answer) I believe that China must plan for itself and not allow others to use the name of "open door" to carry out aggression and monopolization. That would be ideal. (Question) What about the economic relationship between the Dutch East Indies and China? (Answer) According to our observation, your country does not seem to welcome Chinese intellectuals to come south.</p>
<p>After the questions and answers were finished, there was a long silence. Then, Mr. Hu slowly said, "The above conversation is my personal opinion. Please do not regard it as the political view of a certain faction."</p>

<h3>Reasons for Establishing Children's Courts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A professor at Xiamen University suggested the following reasons for the judicial conference to establish children's courts: The handling of children's crimes should focus primarily on education and not on punishment. The emphasis should be on reforming and educating them, and they should not be publicly tried or regarded as criminals. Furthermore, the incident should not be published in the newspapers to expose their crimes. Otherwise, it would only exacerbate their shame and block their path to self-renewal. Such actions, if taken at the spur of the moment, would inevitably contradict modern criminal policy. Civilized countries in Europe and the West have established special children's courts to specialize in such trials, and our country should follow suit. The Ministry of Justice is currently considering this matter. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Issue of Banning Oil Shipments to Italy</h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>Mussolini's expedition to East Africa, although not stopped by the League of Nations' sanctions, has clearly faced significant difficulties as a result. The Committee of Eighteen is scheduled to meet again on the 12th of this month to vote on the date for banning oil shipments to Italy. The British cabinet has decided to participate after a three-hour cabinet meeting. It is heard that the French government has also reached an understanding with Britain. If Mussolini still refuses to comply, then the ban on oil and other similar severe plans will be gradually implemented in the very short term. This poses a very serious threat to Italy, which is poor in resources.</p>
<p>According to the League of Nations' further sanctions plans, the first to be banned from being shipped to Italy are kerosene and gasoline, followed by major products such as copper, iron, coal, and cotton. These are raw materials necessary for industry in peacetime and the driving force of mechanized armies in wartime, all of which Italy lacks. For example, nine-thirds of the oil burned is supplied by the United States and Romania, while coal depends entirely on supplies from Britain and Germany. Once the source is cut off, the stagnation of industry is a given, and in terms of military affairs, the operation of aircraft and the transportation of ships will lose their flexibility due to the lack of fuel. In view of the crisis ahead, Mussolini decided a few days ago to establish a state-run metal mining bureau to be responsible for the exploitation of domestic mines and ordered gas plants and coal mines to maximize production. There is also a plan to use alcohol as a substitute for fuel, which is enough to reveal his awkward predicament.</p>
<p>The ban on oil was originally based on a motion by the Canadian representative, but the Canadian government suddenly announced yesterday that its representative's proposal was not representative of the government's opinion. This is not surprising. In the British Empire, Canada's policies have always been known for their stability. Throughout history, collective security movements such as the 1922 Mutual Assistance Treaty and the 1924 Geneva Protocol have failed due to Canada's opposition. At the first session of the League of Nations, the Canadian representative said, "In this group of mutual insurance, the responsibilities of each country are quite unequal. Our situation is certainly not combustible, and we are very far from the flammable materials." It seems unwilling to assume more obligations for international security. Canada has always followed this principle in its attitude towards international issues. The denial of its representative's remarks in Geneva this time has not violated its consistent spirit. Moreover, according to yesterday's telegram, the Canadian government will still support sanctions against Italy, so it can be seen that this matter has not had a major impact on the progress of the sanctions policy.</p>
<p>However, the effectiveness of this sanction still depends on the degree of cooperation of various countries. Judging from the current situation, the United States, which is in an important position, although not a member of the League of Nations and bound by its own neutrality law, its Interior Minister Ickes has first advised exporters to stop selling oil to Italy. Secretary of State Hull recently reiterated that it is also possible that US cotton will not be exported to warring countries. Other major oil-producing countries, such as Romania, seem to be hesitant, but are also prepared to follow the united action of various countries. Iraq is only looking to Britain for guidance. The Soviet Union and Iran are even more obviously in favor of further sanctions. Therefore, the cooperation of various countries is unlikely to encounter any problems.</p>
<h3>Resolving the Italian-Abyssinian Dispute: The Atmosphere of Peace Talks Intensifies; Smooth Discussions Between British and French Experts; Hoare to Meet with Laval</h3>
<p>(London) According to news from Paris, discussions between British and French experts aimed at resolving the Italian-Abyssinian War are proceeding very smoothly. It is heard that the differences of opinion between the two countries are not fundamental. The experts may complete their work in a matter of days. It is widely believed that they did not discuss plans involving the cession of land to Italy, but only discussed the details of the suggestions made by the former League of Nations Committee of Five, which would grant Italy significant economic benefits in Abyssinia and the southern province of Ogaden. French Prime Minister Laval is keeping the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerruti, informed of the progress of the talks, which is noteworthy. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) News from here today indicates that Britain and France have decided to offer Italy further peace terms before implementing the oil embargo. The plan will still be based on the proposals rejected by Mussolini in mid-August, namely, placing Abyssinia under League of Nations trusteeship, with Italy assuming the greatest responsibility for the trusteeship. In addition, there is a proposed land swap between Italy and Abyssinia to provide Abyssinia with a sea outlet. It is claimed that Mussolini is willing to study this solution. As for the plan itself, it has not yet been formally drafted, but today the atmosphere surrounding the situation in Europe has become noticeably more optimistic. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a London dispatch received by Le Matin, British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare will arrive in France from London this Saturday to meet with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval. During the meeting, he will present Laval with several proposals that are very helpful in quickly resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute and will bring the opinions of Britain and France into complete harmony. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>British and French Views Increasingly Converge</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare will travel to Switzerland at the end of this week for a few days of rest and will arrive in Paris on Saturday to hold talks with French Prime Minister Laval. According to sources at our agency, the solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute drafted by British and French experts will be jointly discussed by Hoare and Laval. Regarding this solution, the opinions of Britain and France are now increasingly converging. It is heard that the two countries have agreed to divide Abyssinian territory into two parts: the core area and the non-Amharic areas, with the non-Amharic areas coming under Italian control. However, Britain and France still find it difficult to agree on the extent of control. Britain argues that while Italy can participate in the administration of the area, its sovereignty should still be held by the Emperor of Abyssinia. Italy's territorial claims in the Tigray Province can also be satisfied, but in exchange for Abyssinia gaining an outlet to the Red Sea. It is generally believed that this plan will not be acceptable to either Mussolini or the Abyssinian Emperor. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome Feels a Sense of Relief</p>
<p>(Rome) According to our agency's diplomatic correspondent, political circles here only began to feel a sense of relief yesterday regarding the solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. This is because unofficial news from Paris suggests that the talks between British Foreign Office expert on Abyssinian affairs, Mr. Patteson, and the head of the African Department of the French Foreign Ministry, Mr. Saint-Quentin, and other experts, are sufficient to produce a proposal for resolving the dispute that is acceptable to Italy. Regarding the solution to the dispute, Italy's view is that the northern province of Tigray should not be abandoned, as it has been occupied by Italian forces. The people of that province are wholeheartedly devoted to the Italian side, and their voluntary surrender sometimes precedes the arrival of Italian troops. Some villagers have even come to pledge allegiance before the arrival of Italian troops. If Italian troops were to withdraw, the Abyssinian government would implement retaliatory measures. To abandon the people of that province would be a dereliction of duty. As for Italian Somaliland, officials here believe that the Paris experts' talks must have touched on the demarcation of the boundary between Italian Somaliland and the southern regions of Abyssinia. The new boundary line will be changed from an oblique line from northeast to southwest to a straight line from north to south. Specialists in colonial administration are closely monitoring developments in this area, as the mountainous terrain there is easy to develop and is of utmost importance. In short, as of now, the news from Paris to Rome, although unofficial, is largely encouraging and has dispelled the gloomy atmosphere. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Widespread Rumors of Italy and the US Reaching an Oil Agreement; Rome and US Oil Companies Deny It; US Political Authorities Unwilling to Comment</h3>
<p>(Rome) Today, the Associated Press learned from reliable sources that the Italian government has reached a "gentleman's agreement" with the Italian-American Oil Company, a branch of Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso), to cope with the League of Nations' oil embargo against Italy. If the League of Nations Sanctions Committee passes the embargo, the Italian-American Oil Company will supply as much oil as possible to Italy in exchange for a 30-year monopoly on the Italian oil market. All oil will be supplied from Esso oil wells outside the United States, with the largest source being Romania, transported to Italy via Hungary, in order to avoid violating the US government's neutrality policy. The agreement also stipulates that Italian Eritrea can be supplied directly from the Far East, thus avoiding the Suez Canal controlled by Britain. This plan has guaranteed that the oil supply to the Italian forces in East Africa will never be depleted. It has also been learned here that Esso has agreed to extend a loan of 1 billion lire to Italy so that Italy can purchase oil with the loan. Once the League of Nations passes the oil embargo, this agreement will take effect. It is expected that this news will be denied by officials and related parties, but after a thorough investigation of three days, the Associated Press is convinced that it is reliable. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) An official statement today declared that the Associated Press's report that Italy has entered into a contract with the Italian-American Oil Company is completely unfounded. (National News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) News from Rome that the Italian government has reached an oil agreement with Esso has caused great shock here. State Department officials are paying close attention to this news but are unwilling to comment. They maintain that the US government's policy has nothing to do with the League of Nations and that its sole purpose is to keep the United States out of war. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(New York) Walter Teagle, chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey, today completely denied the Rome news that the company had reached an agreement with the Italian government to lend oil. Teagle said that this agreement would be impossible to fulfill and called it "a ridiculous piece of propaganda." He claimed that to his knowledge, the company's Italian branch has not received any proposal for such an agreement because "the authorities of the company in that region know that such a contract is absolutely unacceptable to this company." (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) International circles here regard the rumors of the Italian government reaching an agreement with Esso as "a deception." If it were true, the parties involved would not allow the details of the agreement to be leaked before the League of Nations implements the oil embargo. Diplomats said that if Romania imports oil into Italy via Hungary, the League of Nations can quickly prevent it. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Observers familiar with the situation here do not believe the Rome rumors of an oil agreement because Romania has already expressed its willingness to participate in the oil embargo against Italy, and the Iranian government will prohibit the export of oil owned by American companies. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Canada Disapproves of the Oil Embargo</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to responsible sources in Rome, the move to embargo oil to Italy will be abandoned because the Canadian government does not approve of its representative in Geneva proposing this motion. At the same time, the French Ambassador to Rome had a long conversation with Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich yesterday. It is heard that the French Ambassador asked Suvich to present proposals for resolving the dispute with Abyssinia, but Suvich has not yet taken action. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Hungary Suffers from Sanctions Against Italy</h3>
<p>Budapest, Hungary: Hungarian Minister of Commerce de Wynckler recently told a Havas reporter, "The situation created by the implementation of sanctions against Italy by various countries is not only of no benefit to the Hungarian national economy, but has so far produced harmful results. The export of Hungarian livestock to Italy is critical to the lifeblood of the Hungarian economy. Although Hungary can continue to export as usual because it is not participating in the sanctions, Hungarian exports are still inevitably reduced because Italy restricts meat consumption, and there is no profit to be made. A large amount of Hungarian meat is currently stored in Italy and has not yet been sold." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Hull Issues Another Warning to Domestic Arms Dealers; Orders Registration; Criminal Prosecution for Violations; Secretary of the Interior Expresses Unwillingness to Ban Oil to Italy</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull today sternly warned all businesses and individuals engaged in the arms trade who have not yet registered in accordance with the Neutrality Act. Hull hopes that their failure to register is due to negligence but said that violators will be subject to criminal prosecution after a short deadline. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of the Interior Ickes spoke today, changing his previous remarks in favor of banning oil exports to Italy. He said that his remarks on November 21 regarding exports to Italy and Abyssinia had been misunderstood. In fact, he only asked Americans to comply with the government's plan to stop transporting arms and wheat. The State Department did not want to comment on Ickes's remarks, but said that the government's policy of not encouraging the large-scale export of various war materials to belligerent countries has not changed to this day, but it does not want to completely ban oil exports. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Italy Is Fearless in Resisting the Oil Embargo; Actively Developing Domestic Minerals; and Maximizing the Use of Alternatives</h3>
<p>(Rome) If various countries implement an oil embargo against Italy, Italy will use two methods to resist it: one is to actively develop the minerals buried underground in the country to increase domestic oil production, and the other is to maximize the use of other fuels to replace oil. Domestic oil wells such as the Byasan diesel well produced 30,000 tons of oil last year, and active mining will naturally be carried out in the future to increase production. In addition, there are several oil wells in Sicily, Piedmont, and the Adriatic coast that will also be developed. As for alternatives to oil, according to research results, the rocks produced in Valdarno, Abruzzo, Sardinia, Umbria, Saggio di Tolando, Magella, and Marche contain lignite components, which can be used to refine oil. In addition, the marsh gas produced in Salsomaggiore can also be used as fuel. At present, most trucks and buses use carbon gas as fuel. In addition, wood alcohol and hydrogenated spirits are the best oil substitutes. The government has also taken various measures to increase alcohol production, which involves extracting alcohol from wines, grains, and beets, and then mixing this alcohol with oil to produce a new liquid fuel called "Lopol." This new fuel contains 50% oil and 48% alcohol and is currently sold throughout the country. At the same time, calcium carbide is used as automobile fuel, and the results of the experiment are very good, and the price is low and easy to popularize. In short, Italy is fearless about the oil supply, and the fact that this year's automobile race has not been stopped shows that the Italian authorities do not consider the situation after various countries impose an oil embargo to be very difficult.

<h3>Italian Queen Donates Wedding Ring to War Effort</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Queen telegraphed Mussolini today, expressing her willingness to donate her and her husband's wedding rings to the war effort. The telegram stated that her wedding ring was the most precious of all her possessions because it would never let her forget the day she was fortunate enough to become an Italian. It is noted that the Italian Queen is Helen of Montenegro. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Naval Policy Insists on the Principle of Equality; London Conference Involves Politics; Expresses Readiness to Consider; Italian Delegation Selected</h3>
<p>(London) A responsible Japanese official today expressed his opinion to a special Reuters naval conference reporter, saying that the basic principle of Japanese naval policy is to seek security. According to the Japanese view, this security must be achieved through the equality of the British, American, and Japanese navies and the abolition or active restriction of offensive armaments such as battleships, aircraft carriers, and 10,000-ton cruisers. Japan believes that the equality of naval power between countries can provide security because the attacker will always be at a disadvantage. Japan opposes the mutual announcement of shipbuilding procedures because it does not recognize naval equality, at least in principle. Japan will participate in this conference in a spirit of harmony. If the United States does not take a tough stance, Japan does not want to take this attitude. Japan's purpose in participating in this conference is to establish a compromise and does not want to be responsible for the breakdown of the conference. As for political issues, they are not within the scope of the instructions given to the Japanese delegation, but Japan is prepared to consider continuing Article 19 of the Washington Treaty regarding Japan and the United States not being allowed to set up defense projects on certain desert islands in the Pacific. The consideration of the 1921 Four-Power Treaty is beyond the scope of the Japanese delegation's authority. However, although the Japanese delegation has not received instructions on a Far East non-aggression pact, Japan can also approve the proposal to conclude such a pact if it is proposed at the conference. Japan advocates the abolition of submarines, but this requires the conference to issue a declaration that it will no longer build submarines, and Germany and Russia, which are not participating in the conference, should also make the same commitment. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The members of the Italian delegation to the London Naval Conference have recently been decided as follows: the chief representative is the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Grandi. The other representatives are Rear Admiral Bini, Deputy Chief of Naval Staff Rear Admiral Pissia, naval experts Marcutini and Riccado Borgoni, and Lieutenant Colonel Farina. In addition, de Siris will serve as a delegation advisor, and Mr. Vitteti, counselor of the British Embassy, will also join the delegation. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Government Plans to Raise Currency Value; Implement New Economic System</h3>
<p>(London) It is generally believed that the Soviet Union is now preparing to implement a large number of new plans to raise currency prices and implement a new economic system. From January next year, retail prices will be reduced by 15% to 40%, and wages will also be reduced, but the rate of reduction will not be as great as the reduction in the prices of manufactured goods and food. In other words, although nominal wages will be reduced, actual wages will instead increase. In terms of production, the Soviet authorities plan to increase the average production standard of each worker, using this standard as the basis for calculating wages. The current currency will be revised to a new unit to make it a sound currency, because the progress of the Soviet gold mining industry and the sharp increase in general production have greatly improved the reserve rate of its banknotes.

<h3>The Historical Facts of the British, French, and Italian Rivalry in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Among the two major powers most closely related to Abyssinia, France is the most unassuming, occupying only a small corner in the central-eastern part of Abyssinia as its sphere of influence. However, its achievements in the economic development of Abyssinia are greater than those of any other foreign country, and it is still making progress. Abyssinia's only major industry is the 500-mile narrow-gauge railway built by the French, which runs from the port of Djibouti in the small French colony of Somaliland to the Abyssinian capital of Addis Ababa. The French have claimed that this is a clear indication that economic success can be achieved without political rule. This statement is indeed well-founded. France has been operating in Abyssinia for a century, hoping to become an important player, and it was not until this railway was built and could be profitable that it achieved complete success. The first treaty between France and Abyssinia was concluded between the French administrator Philippe and the local Abyssinian monarch Han Lasi. It was a friendly agreement that allowed the French to receive the most preferential treatment in Abyssinia and to enjoy rich commercial privileges. In fact, this agreement was of little benefit to either side, and most treaties signed with the Abyssinian king were like this.</p>
<p>In 1862, the French purchased a village on the shores of the Gulf of Tadjoura called Wobok for 10,000 US dollars. This gulf is located at the lower end of the Red Sea, opposite the British port of Aden, and adjacent to the Abyssinian border. They originally wanted to use this village as the center of the French colony, but later, because the land was not suitable for habitation, they found a completely new town on the opposite side of the bay called Djibouti to replace it. Thus, the builders of the French Empire did not hesitate to work hard to operate it, making it the only gateway for communication between Abyssinia and the outside world.</p>
<p>In 1894, a French company, relying on the influence of the French advisor to the Abyssinian Emperor Menelik's court, obtained the concession to build a railway from Djibouti across Abyssinia to the White Nile in Sudan. This was the first step in the rivalry between France and Britain to compete for possession of the central African land. At that time, Sudan and the upper reaches of the Nile were unclaimed wasteland, and the powerful could seize it at will. Everyone believed that whoever seized it first would own it. In this competition, France promised Emperor Menelik of Abyssinia to expand his territory to the Nile in order to gain Abyssinian assistance; Britain promised Italy to make all of Abyssinia the sphere of activity for Italy as a reward in order to gain Italian assistance. Britain plotted to seize Sudan, while Italy occupied part of the land of Abyssinia, which Italy later implemented.</p>
<p>Britain occupied Egypt in 1882, so it sent troops from the north, advancing across Egypt, and conquering Sudan along the way. Britain hoped that one army would be sent south from Cairo and another army would be sent north from the Cape of Good Hope, and that they would meet in the upper reaches of the White Nile. In this way, they could encompass the entire land spanning the African continent. However, the French army also advanced aggressively from its West African colonies and East African territories, hoping to meet in the middle and sweep across the land from west to east across the African continent, forming a whole.</p>
<p>When the French representative signed the Djibouti Railway Agreement in the Abyssinian capital, he dreamed that one day he would be able to board a French train on the shores of the Indian Ocean, cross the entire African continent, and get off on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean in a week or two. Britain hoped to reach Cairo from the Cape of Good Hope, and France hoped to reach the Atlantic Ocean from the Indian Ocean. Both countries entrusted capable personnel to carry out this plan. They all perked up their spirits, exhausted their intelligence, and carried out the mission of the country. They competed for a small village in central Africa called Fashoda, like a race. The prize for being the first to arrive was one million square miles of land. Lord Kitchener represented Britain, leading a large army from the north, chiseling roads when encountering dangers, building bridges when encountering water, and suppressing the fierce natives along the way. On the French side, one army was led by Captain Marchand, advancing from the west, passing through many swamps and jungles along the way. Another army was led by the Marquis de Bonchamps, advancing from the east through the canyons of the Abyssinian Plateau. At that time, it was the rainy season, and it was raining heavily. At one time, the soldiers' clothes were soaked through, causing them to shiver. Often, they used all their strength to travel only six miles a day, for several weeks. In May 18897, Bonchamps arrived in the Abyssinian capital, about 600 miles from his destination. At this time, Marchand had advanced to the upper reaches of the Ubangi River, where the river was flooding, making it difficult to cross, and there were still many extremely difficult swamps to pass ahead. Kitchener was more than 1,200 miles away, separated by three huge waterfalls and a large number of fierce enemies blocking the way. In August, the Abyssinian expedition suddenly appeared in the largest mountain range, less than 300 miles from Fashoda. Marchand had entered the Nile River basin, less than 500 miles from his destination. Kitchener was blocked by Muslims and was very far away. About a year later, the Abyssinian expedition advanced to within a day's journey of the Nile River and suddenly returned for some reason. However, another team of 10,000 Abyssinian soldiers followed closely. On June 2, 1898, the team planted the Abyssinian flag on the right bank of the Nile River a few miles above the village of Fashoda, and the French flag on the left bank. Thus, Emperor Menelik's dream of expanding the borders of his empire to the African continent was realized. Eighteen days later, Marchand led his army into Fashoda and raised the French flag. At this time, Kitchener was still 400 miles away, waiting for the water to rise and preparing for a fierce battle. The French can be considered to have won the race. With the help of the Abyssinian people, they opened a road across the African continent and occupied a section of the river from the source of the Nile to Egypt. Britain had suffered a setback, and the most important river was cut off by others. When Marchand announced that the vast area west of the Nile was French territory, Paris held triumphant celebrations. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Baldwin Vigorously Defends Foreign Policy; Strives to Promote Reconciliation in the Italian-Abyssinian Affair; Treaties Can Be Amended but Unilateral Cancellation is Intolerable</h3>
<p>(London) In the British House of Commons today, following the reading of the King's Speech, a debate on the response took place. Prime Minister Baldwin vigorously defended the government's foreign policy, stating that he did not want to miss any opportunity for Britain to secure peace instead of war. The League of Nations is currently undergoing a trial, but if it can end the Italian-Abyssinian war, all peace-loving Europeans will be grateful, provided that the terms of peace are those it has stipulated.</p>
<p>The proposer of the motion for the response was Conservative Member of Parliament Wakefield, known as a football player, so many speakers used sporting terms in jest. The seconder was Sir Barrie, who praised Wakefield's excellent ball-handling. Labour leader Attlee said that since Mr. Chamberlain joined the government team, he has been getting the ball and kicking it. He also said that it was strange that the King's Speech used the same wording to refer to both aggressor nations and nations fulfilling their treaty obligations. The government should report in detail on the progress of all matters in the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. He did not know how a solution acceptable to Italy, Abyssinia, and the League of Nations could be achieved. Upon close examination of the King's Speech, its true focus is on increasing armaments, with everything else being merely window dressing.</p>
<p>Baldwin replied that he wished Parliament to discuss the very important international situation in detail, but Foreign Secretary Hoare was ill at home and may be able to attend the House of Commons tomorrow or the day after, at which time discussions could be held. Therefore, he did not wish to say much today. Any politician in this country who does not hold honorable events with other countries in the League of Nations, causing this country to fall into war, will be condemned by all. The dignity of treaties should indeed be upheld, but it is not the case that once a treaty is established, it can never be amended. Amending a treaty is one thing, while canceling a treaty is another. Unilateral cancellation is called violence, not consensual amendment. Europe is now determined to prevent the tearing up of treaties, and this year's events have proven this point, as all European countries, even though one friendly nation has now been declared an aggressor, have resolutely disregarded friendship and agreed to participate in economic sanctions that have been implemented and are considering future sanction measures. Some people believe that Britain is being too forward. It should be known that Britain has to follow other countries in fulfilling its duty. Powerful countries like Britain have to take responsibility and express their opinions at the right time. Britain will study with other countries whether there are honorable ways to end this war on terms acceptable to Abyssinia and the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Baldwin then spoke about domestic affairs, saying that the government's industrial policy over the past four years has been fundamentally about creating a state of trust among the people, protecting it with appropriate tax rates that can promote industrial prosperity. Regarding the coal mining issue, he hopes that the current discussions can not only establish understanding but also promote progress in reform. The government, in accordance with the policy stipulated in the 1930 Coal Mines Act of the previous Labour government, has decided to submit a bill immediately, agreeing to coal mine rents, as a necessary prerequisite for future work, and as part of a policy to assist the coal industry. Regarding national defense, he hopes that the House of Commons can debate this extremely important and difficult matter after the Christmas recess. The government also hopes to pass a bill to expand unemployment insurance during this parliamentary term, so that agricultural workers can benefit from this bill in the coming winter.

<h3>Northern and Southern Fronts: Abyssinian Forces Switch to Offensive; Skirmishes Near Magaal; Southern Route Forms "Hindenburg Line"</h3>
<p>(London) According to sources from Asmara, a large number of Abyssinian troops, well-equipped with armaments, are now advancing towards Magaal, their aim apparently being to attack Italian forces. It is reported that these troops are from the command of General Gasa, commander-in-chief of the Abyssinian forces in the north, assisted by the regular army of General Mulugheta. It is reported that the Abyssinian forces plan to strike at the southernmost point about fifteen miles south of Magaal. According to Italian bulletins, the Abyssinian advance has boosted the morale of Italian troops. If the Abyssinian forces are indeed determined to engage in a concentrated battle with Italian forces, the Italian command will have an opportunity to achieve a great victory, which will certainly be more fruitful than numerous guerrilla engagements. (4th Reuters)</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Abyssinian capital, Harar, reports that the "Hindenburg Line" constructed by Abyssinian forces between Daga Bur and British Somaliland, and between Harar and Jijiga, has now been completed. This project was supervised by Turkish advisor General Vehip Bey. The Abyssinian forces originally planned to hold this line to defend against a major Italian offensive that was expected to be launched shortly after the outbreak of war. However, the troops under General Nasibu, commander-in-chief of the Abyssinian forces in the south, are impatient to wait for the Italian attack. Many officers under his command are now advocating taking the offensive along the Daga Bur line, with the troops under General Lesta on the southwestern front providing support. However, several senior officers do not support this strategy, believing that Abyssinia's terrain favors defense over offense, especially because Italian weapons are sophisticated, so it is not advisable to engage in a large-scale direct confrontation with them. (4th Reuters)</p>
<p>Asmara: According to a communique released here today, Italian forces and the troops of Abyssinian General Seyoum have made contact twice in the past two days. In the second encounter, Italian forces again emerged victorious. Italian forces began to enter the Tembien Plateau three weeks ago, and have now engaged in their fourth skirmish near the Abaro Pass. One column of Italian forces defeated 200 Abyssinian soldiers, killing several. Italian forces suffered one white officer and five soldiers wounded. The fighting in the Tembien region has been limited to small-scale battles, but has been quite intense. So far, there has been no large-scale battle. Italian forces claim to have repeatedly emerged victorious, suffering fewer casualties than the enemy. The Abyssinian forces were scheduled to attack yesterday, as it was the feast day of Saint George, an ancient Abyssinian warrior. At the same time, one battalion of Eritrean troops in the Italian forces has advanced and reached the town of Melfa, ten miles from Gherza Moro, now within the borders of Abbi Addi, the capital of Tembien province. A small detachment of Abyssinian soldiers attacked an Italian outpost between Dolo and Magaal, but were driven back by Italian soldiers. One Italian soldier was wounded. Italian forces claim to have captured half of the Tembien region. Abyssinian General Seyoum is still leading approximately 1,000 soldiers to hold the remaining territory. (4th Reuters)</p>
<h3>A Photo of Battlefield Misery</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters special correspondent Collins cabled from somewhere south of Jijiga as follows: I have just witnessed the most tragic scene I have ever seen in my life. Abyssinian soldiers wounded on the battlefield have been sent to hospitals in Daga Bur and Jijiga, all suffering from severe injuries, many of whom have not received treatment for a week or more. There are no hospitals or temporary treatment stations south of Daga Bur, and the means of transporting the wounded from the front lines back behind the lines are also insufficient. Doctors and the wounded alike describe the horrors of the battlefield, saying that wounded soldiers often lie on the battlefield for days, sometimes dying from exposure, sometimes dying from festering wounds. There is a great lack of hemostatic equipment, personnel to transport the wounded, and workers skilled in first aid. However, one very special characteristic is admirable, that is, the wounded have no complaints. I spoke with a wounded non-commissioned officer who had a bullet lodged two inches deep in his lower leg. It was only today, after twelve days, that he received his first treatment. Doctors may be able to save his life, but his leg must be amputated. If not treated quickly, there is a risk of poisoning. However, two things are particularly pleasing: one is that there are relatively few wounded, with fewer than 200 in the hospitals in Jijiga and Daga Bur combined; the other is the excellent work of the Egyptian Prince Taufiq's ambulance service, which includes many British and American doctors working together with some Abyssinian doctors.

<h3>Debate on Party Strife Disrupts French Parliament; Left and Right Wing Deputies Engage in Heated Arguments; Discussion to Continue Today</h3>
<p>The Final Fate of the Cabinet is at Stake</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies was greatly disrupted today during the debate on the issue of outlawing French fascist parties, leading to a temporary suspension of the session. Left-wing Deputy Roucaud claimed that Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval had failed to prohibit the Croix-de-Feu organization, allowing it to "practice civil war." Laval defended himself. Later, Justice Minister Penard also rose to speak, but was shouted down in the Chamber, and the session adjourned. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, the Chamber of Deputies continued its session to discuss the activities of fascist groups. Deputies from the left and right wings engaged in fierce arguments, and the atmosphere in the Chamber was extremely tense. Radical Socialist Deputy Luca and Socialist Deputy Valliere spoke successively, criticizing the Laval cabinet for being too lenient towards fascist groups, and stating that extreme right-wing newspapers had repeatedly "incited murder," but Justice Minister Bérard had not ordered them to be punished. By 7:00 PM, the Chamber officially announced adjournment. Tomorrow is a holiday, so the issue of fascist group activities will not be able to continue to be discussed until Thursday. The final fate of the government will not be decided until then. Furthermore, opinions within the Radical Socialist Party are still very divided, with most advocating opposition to the government, so the outcome of the debate is currently uncertain. However, it is possible that the government's situation may improve after Laval makes a statement in the Chamber. (3rd Havas)</p>
<h3>British Minister of Works Praises Chinese Art; Exhibition of Antiquities Allows Understanding of the Chinese Soul; Hopes for the Flourishing of the National Spirit</h3>
<p>(London) The British government hosted a banquet at Lancaster House today for those involved in the International Exhibition of Chinese Art. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi gave a speech, mentioning the enthusiastic support of Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei for this exhibition, and stating that the British people have a deep and genuine appreciation for Chinese art, such as painting and sculpture. He believes that the Chinese people will only feel more precious their own national art from seeing this. Strange ideas between China and the West on matters other than art have been forever eliminated by this exhibition. Chairman and Minister of Works Gore gave a speech, stating that we know more about the Chinese soul from this exhibition than from reading many books. We have long known that China is the source of pleasing and delightful things, but few know that China is a fountain from which spiritual and religious art arises. Although circumstances change and the world is constantly changing rapidly, we hope that what Chinese art has left behind will not only be preserved but will also be developed and expanded, and we hope that China will produce great artists in the future. The Times commented on Gore's remarks today, calling them to the point, stating that in the case of China, the word "soul" is particularly appropriate. The virtues expressed by various Chinese artists, no matter how noble, the solemn or interesting emotions they reveal, no matter how profound, all seem to arise from self-awareness, which is beyond the reach of Western art. We now understand Chinese art more thoroughly than our ancestors because we have approached a psychological habit that allows for the convergence of European and Asian ideas. Making common understanding between the peoples of East and West, this is the highest goal of the Royal Academy's exhibition this winter, needless to say. (3rd Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Debt Conversion Surplus to Fund Defense Spending</h3>
<p>(London) The Treasury Department recently implemented interest rate swaps on public bonds, which are expected to yield a surplus of approximately £50 million to be used for defense spending. This expenditure will be submitted to Parliament for discussion in the near future. Most of this money will be allocated to the Admiralty to immediately implement naval shipbuilding programs, with only a small portion used for the construction of industrial works in "depressed areas." Those responsible also believe that after this £50 million of defense spending is allocated, the government will issue a smaller amount of debt to supplement defense spending. (3rd Havas)</p>

<h3>Hubei Natives Association in Beijing Plans to Petition the Central Government on Three Matters</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Hubei Natives Association in Beijing proposed to petition the central government on three matters: 1. This year's devastating floods in the Xiang River and the Yangtze River caused a loss of 50,000 to 60,000 lives and property damage of more than 10 million, with crop losses reaching over 100 million. With winter approaching, if no relief measures are taken, it is feared that people will resort to desperate measures, endangering the country. The dikes and embankments that need to be repaired and heightened are no less than several thousand miles long. If this work is not completed within three months, it is feared that more disasters will occur when the spring flood arrives. 2. The Xiangqi Mountain iron mine was requested to be opened by Zhang Zhidong to supply iron and steel to the Hanyang Iron Works. In the past, it was sold to Shanghai. After the September 18th Incident, Li Fanyi, as the director of the Construction Department, refused to sell it. At the same time, the scope of the mine was reduced. Recently, the ban was lifted and an exclusive sales contract was signed with a certain country. Regardless of the profits, the lifeline of a modern country is entirely dependent on coal and iron. We should not cut our own strength to make up for the shortcomings of others, thereby forfeiting our own advantages. 3. Joint office work and streamlining government expenses are well-intentioned. Why is it that after joint office work in Hubei Province, a Wuchang Municipal Office was established, and some of the responsibilities of the Construction, Education, and Finance Departments were transferred to the jurisdiction of the office, with monthly expenses reaching 27,000 yuan, or over 300,000 yuan per year? The locals believe that there is no need to establish a municipal government in Wuchang. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>New Yu Section of the Beining Railway: The Establishment of a Puppet Supervisory Office, Appropriation of Passenger and Freight Charges, and Illegal Infringement on Railway Rights</h3>
<p>A Tianjin dispatch reports that Yin Tong returned to Tianjin from Beijing on the morning of the 2nd. Although he accompanied Chen Yi, he also bears certain missions regarding the current North China diplomacy. Furthermore, the urgent need to address the important affairs of the Beining Railway itself is also the main reason for his hasty return north. In the afternoon of the 2nd, the Railway Bureau held an important bureau affairs meeting, attended by staff above the section chief level. Although this reporter was unable to attend in person due to other commitments, the points to be discussed had already been instructed to Deputy Bureau Chiefs Lu Mengxiong and Zheng Shi Zhao. The core of the important discussions at the meeting revolved around the illegal infringement on railway rights by the establishment of a supervisory office for the Xin Yu section of the Beining Railway by the puppet Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee, and a contingency plan was formulated. The section from Xinhe to Yu Guan on the Beining Railway is over 270 kilometers long, accounting for about two-thirds of the entire length of the current Beining Railway mainline. It has always been the main source of revenue for railway freight and passenger transport. Recently, the Railway Bureau's revenue, coinciding with the peak season, has averaged about 2.4 to 2.5 million per month, with the Xin Yu section accounting for over 1.3 million. All railway materials and rolling stock, except for those in Tianjin and Ping, are mostly located in this section. Important facilities such as the Xinhe Station material factory, Tangshan rolling stock factory, and the Chegong branches in Luoxian and Shanhaiguan are all crucial construction sites for the entire railway. If the puppet organization implements its supervision and directly severs this section, it would be fatal to the Beining Railway. However, until recently, although the puppet organization had established a railway supervisory office, it had not actually infringed on railway administration. Only the daily income from freight and passenger transport at Tangshan Station was being appropriated, but the amount was still small. Some materials and furniture stored at the Tangshan rolling stock factory were also being requisitioned. The local rolling stock section chief and stationmaster were powerless to resist and could only allow them to take what they wanted. The Luoxian Iron Bridge, Xinhe, Tangshan, and other rolling stock and material factories were being monitored by personnel dispatched by Zhao Lei's 4th Security Brigade. Apart from this, the order at other stations remained normal. According to the Beining Railway Bureau's speculation, the reason why the puppet organization has not taken over the stations is because it is concerned about the British capital invested in the railway and because the division of the Xin Yu section from the Beining mainline would inevitably lead to a sharp decline in revenue, at most only 700,000 per month. And even from that amount, the freight charges for coal transport recorded in Kai Luan, about 300,000 per month, would have to be deducted. The remaining amount would not be sufficient to cover expenses, so they could not help but be hesitant and wavering. The puppet supervisory office head, Lu Qiu, originally served as the secretary of the Beining Railway Bureau. His real name is Zhen Huan. In July, he was hired by Yin Rugeng to serve as the chief of the General Affairs Section of the Luan Yu District Administrative Commissioner's Office. Now, seeing that he has turned traitor, his puppet supervisory office is located in Tangshan and is divided into six sections. The personnel for each section have already been announced: Bo Zhu is the chief of the General Affairs Section, Han Zikui is the chief of the Accounting Section, Chen Juesheng (current chief of the Tangshan rolling stock section of the Beining Railway) is the chief of the Rolling Stock Section, Xie Zhen (current director of the Tangshan Iron Factory of the Beining Railway) is the chief of the Machinery Section, Xu Kaixian (Tangshan Station engineer) is the chief of the Works Section, and Qu Shihe is the chief of the Police Section. Although some current Beining Railway employees have been appointed by the puppet organization, they have not accepted the appointments and are not subject to their control. Lu Qiu secretly came to Tianjin a few days ago and had secret contacts with the Tianjin office of the South Manchuria Railway. Over the past three days, dozens of senior employees of the South Manchuria Railway have come to Tianjin together, supposedly to accept the appointment of the puppet organization, under the guise of entrusted management, to take over the railway affairs of the Xin Yu section. The Beining Railway is paying close attention to this matter and has formulated preventive measures. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Central Government Loan to Aid Jiangxi Province's Finances</h3>
<p>The Economic Commission Will Also Provide Loans to Aid Rural Areas</p>
<p>A Nanchang dispatch reports that due to economic depression and market recession in Jiangxi Province, the Chamber of Commerce, the Money Trade Association, and the Remittance Exchange Association have successively appealed to the central government to allocate legal tender to save the dying industry and commerce and avoid an unmanageable collapse. According to financial circles, the matter of the province borrowing funds from the central government has been successfully resolved through the efforts of Chairman Xiong and Finance Director Wu, who have repeatedly contacted Minister Kong and the Central, China, and Communications Banks in Beijing and Shanghai. The Bank of China will allocate 1 million yuan in legal tender to the Remittance Exchange Association as a fund for discounting acceptance bills, 1.4 million yuan will be handed over to the provincial Yumin Bank for lending to various industries, and another 2 million yuan will be handed over to the Central, China, and Communications Banks for exchange into legal tender. With these 3.4 million yuan, the market in the province should be able to become somewhat active. As for the year-end settlement period, the funds will be lent by the banks to the money shops, and then by the money shops to various industries, to cope with year-end expenses and resources for the opening of the market next year. Furthermore, the National Economic Commission previously planned to establish cooperative banks in four provinces, setting up branches in Jiangxi, Hubei, Anhui, and Hunan to lend to rural cooperatives in those areas, which in turn would lend to farmers to aid rural areas, with a capital of 10 million yuan. Recently, the Economic Commission decided that setting up separate banks would involve excessive expenses, and the loan to cooperative societies to aid rural area item will be entrusted to the Central, China, and Communications Banks.

<h3>Mr. Hu Mingchun Returned to Shanghai Yesterday from Tibet</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Mingchun, a native of Zhejiang, went to study at the International University in India in 1933 with his own funds. Recognizing that the government was actively handling Mongolian and Tibetan border affairs, he went to Tibet to specialize in studying Tibetan and took the opportunity to investigate the situation in Tibet, so as to be of service to the government. Since entering Tibet, it has been two years. Mr. Hu felt that he had mastered Tibetan, so he took a ship Conte Verde of Italian lines, returning home via India, arriving in Shanghai yesterday. The reporter of Guowen News Agency met with Mr. Hu yesterday. According to him, the details of his entry into Tibet and the attitude of Tibetans towards Chinese people are as follows:</p>
<p>Entry into Tibet</p>
<p>Mr. Hu originally studied at Tagore's International University in India, where he met Tibetan students and got along very well with them. He studied Tibetan and Tibetan writing. When Huang Musong and others were sent to Tibet, he accompanied them as a staff member. While in Tibet, he received guidance from the famous monk Tu Tian Sang Pei and gained a good understanding of Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p>Tibetan Thinking</p>
<p>Tibetan thinking is still consistent with traditional thinking. They have a deep understanding and faith in the head of state. They respect the Chinese people very much. In ordinary conversations, they generally regard the Chinese as being one level higher than Tibetans. Since Special Envoy Huang entered Tibet, the Tibetan people's view of the Chinese people has been better, and their faith has also been very strong.</p>
<p>Departure from Tibet</p>
<p>When Mr. Hu left Tibet this time, he encountered the British political officer in Sikkim, Williamson, and others heading towards Tibet when he passed through Kalimpang on the border between India and Tibet. It is said that their entry into Tibet this time was to undertake some mission regarding the development of Indo-Tibetan transportation.</p>

<p>It Has Been Decided to Implement This First at the Nine Major Stations of Jinghu, Huhang, and Ningbo. The Establishment of Other Stations Will Be Discussed by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways.</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that after discussions between the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways, three measures have been decided upon regarding the establishment of postal and telegraph agencies along railway stations: (1) The establishment of postal and telegraph agencies at railway stations by the Ministry of Railways will be trialled first on the Jinghu and Huhangyong lines, based on the three conditions proposed by the Ministry of Railways; (2) The temporary measures for the establishment of railway station postal and telegraph agencies originally stipulated by the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Bureaus, the Shanghai Postal Bureau, and the Telegraph Bureau are considered to be in line with the three conditions proposed by the Ministry of Railways and may be approved for trial implementation; (3) The Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways will separately instruct the two Railway Bureaus and the two bureaus in Shanghai, the Postal Bureau and Telegraph Bureau, to consult and set a date for implementation, and will separately order the two Railway Administrations, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, and the Postal Administration to comply with the implementation. It has now been decided that the postal and telegraph station agencies will first be piloted on the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Bureaus, and it has been stipulated that (A) the Jinghu Line: (1) Nanjing, (2) Bojiang, (3) Changzhou, (4) Wuxi, (5) Shanghai North Station; (B) the Huhang Line: (1) Shanghai South Station, (2) Songjiang, (3) Jiaxing, (4) Hangzhou, etc., are nine major stations. In the future, if the operation is successful, they will be increased at any time. Other railway stations such as Pinghan, Jinpu, Longhai, Jiaoji, Zhengtai, and Beining will continue to be established. It is reported that the three bureaus will proceed with consultations on the joint establishment of agency measures and internal procedures as soon as the Ministry's orders arrive in Shanghai, and will decide on the implementation date after everything has been settled.</p>
<h3>Premier Wang's Back Wound Has Not Healed Yet; It Will Recover with Rest</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that there have been various rumors recently about Premier Wang's condition, some saying that it is trending towards becoming serious and others saying that he has gotten out of bed to walk and even strolled in the garden. In fact, both are overly speculative. According to reliable sources, when Dr. Wang underwent surgery on the 29th of last month, his spirits weakened and his breathing became weak due to the excessive amount of time it took. An examination of his urine that afternoon showed that the sugar content had increased eightfold compared to the morning, and acetone was found in it (the presence of acetone in the urine of ordinary people can cause dizziness). Fortunately, Dr. Noel treated him carefully and he gradually improved. However, there was still a pulse stop phenomenon on the 2nd, and he still felt stomach pain on the 3rd. These were all due to the effects of the injury and surgery, so the wound on his back has not healed yet. Not only is he unable to walk, but he is also unable to sit up. He has been confined to bed all day. Dr. Wang recently sent a telegram to Ambassador Guo Fuchu (Taiqi), saying that his injury will not lead to death or disability, and that he has emerged from danger. As for the injury and the recurrence of old illnesses, it will only recover with rest. Judging from this telegram, Wang's condition can be clearly seen, and the overly speculative rumors are not credible.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that Premier Wang has not seen guests for many days since coming to Shanghai for treatment, in accordance with the doctor's orders. On the afternoon of the previous day, he received Chen Gongbo and Gu Mengyu at his bedside. Although the conversation was very short, he felt insomnia that night. At around 11:00 AM yesterday, he received Tang Youren once. After a doctor's examination in the afternoon, it was discovered that he had inflammation and swelling of the bile ducts and also felt stomach pain. Therefore, all three doctors firmly instructed Wang not to see guests.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul-General in Beijing, Suma, Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday and Visited Ariyoshi and Met with Isogai Yesterday for Talks</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that Suma, First Secretary and Consul-General in Beijing of the Japanese Embassy in China, visited Vice Foreign Minister Xu Mo the day before yesterday afternoon and then took the 5:00 PM express train from Beijing to Shanghai, arriving at 11:30 PM that night. He stayed at the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road. At 9:00 AM yesterday, he first went to the Japanese military attaché's office on Baoding Road to visit Army Attaché Isogai for about an hour. At 10:00 AM, he went to the Japanese Embassy Office on Huangpu Road to visit Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi, reporting on his visits to the two Vice Foreign Ministers, Xu and Tang, and his consultations. Important instructions were sought for diplomatic negotiations on the situation in the north. The talks lasted for an hour and a half, until 11:30 AM. Horiuchi, the embassy's First Secretary, and Arino, the Chinese Secretary, also participated in the talks. According to the Japanese Embassy, a considerable resolution has been reached after discussions between Ariyoshi and others. It is said that Suma will first give an oral reply to the protests previously raised by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Suma is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Beijing on the Shanghai-Ping express train at 4:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>A Good Opportunity to Promote National Products in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that trade between China and Southeast Asia is currently being actively planned and developed by the government and famous manufacturers. Since the implementation of the new currency policy, domestic finance has become stable and the exchange rate has also stabilized due to the government's efforts. Therefore, developing foreign trade is a good opportunity. Chinese exporters to Southeast Asia have always lacked a complete organization. In the past, some merchants, tempted by petty profits, mixed in inferior products and reduced quality, so their credit was not outstanding and they could not compete with foreign merchants with complete organizations. This time, Song Faxiang, our Consul-General in Batavia, has returned to China and has repeatedly discussed matters with domestic industrial, commercial, and financial circles. According to Wang Xingyao, director of the China National Products Promotion Association, international trade development must have a complete organization, such as the promotion of goods and the investigation of local market conditions, and must rely on banks to guarantee payments, so as to avoid losses due to the difficulty or delay in collecting payments. Consul-General Song has returned to China and reported that the failure of national product quality to meet standardization is an important reason for the decline in trade. Therefore, manufacturers themselves should strive for excellent and uniform quality to ensure outstanding credit. In terms of promotion, setting up sample display centers in important areas would not be too costly and would be very effective. As for the investigation of local market conditions, he has requested Song's assistance in guaranteeing the collection of payments and has contacted the Overseas Chinese Bank. If all aspects proceed smoothly, it can be realized in the shortest time. This is a major innovation in China's foreign trade, and the development of trade can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Germany: New Initiatives in Scientific Academy Awards</h3>
<p>The German Academy of Sciences, in commemoration of the scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt, recognizing his contributions to science and his spirit of sacrifice in linguistics, has decided to donate the "Humboldt Medal" on the centenary of Humboldt's death. This is intended to reward those from various countries who are deeply engaged in the study of the German language. This medal will be awarded by the Academy once a year.

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Order: Register Opium Addicts Within a Deadline, Mobilize Land and Water Forces Today to Investigate Opium Addicts, Expand Propaganda to Promote Awareness Among Opium Addicts in the Concessions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau is enforcing the compulsory registration of opium addicts. Yesterday, it received an order from Chairman Chiang to complete the registration within the year and report on the progress of the registration. The Bureau has decided to launch a full-scale land and water mobilization today to investigate opium addicts. The details are as follows, as reported by a reporter from Dagong News Agency:</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Order Sets a Deadline for Completion</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang recently sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating that the registration of opium addicts must be completed within this year. The telegram stated: "The strict prohibition of opium, to the extent that all provinces and cities across the country completely eradicate opium poppies and opium addicts by 1940, has been repeatedly regulated and urged by this Chairman. The results have gradually improved, and the international community has praised this. This year, the Central Government has again issued a clear order, with this Chairman concurrently serving as the National Opium Suppression Commissioner, to ensure the thorough implementation of the deadline for the ban. The simultaneous intensification of banning cultivation and smoking is essential, and no delay is permitted. The registration of opium addicts in various provinces and cities is a crucial key to the strict enforcement of the ban on smoking. This has been repeatedly ordered by the Headquarters. Therefore, I reiterate this clear order: all provinces and cities must thoroughly complete this task by 1935, and all must report the registration progress and detailed numbers of opium addicts to the Headquarters for verification by the end of January 1936. No procrastination is allowed. Otherwise, the responsible officials will be held accountable. It is hoped that you will comply accordingly." After receiving the order, the Municipal Government instructed the Public Security Bureau to comply.</p>
<p>Land and Water Mobilization for Investigation Today</p>
<p>In order to completely eliminate opium and complete the registration of opium addicts, the Municipal Public Security Bureau began a second round of investigations. In recent days, more than 900 unregistered opium addicts have been detained and sent to drug rehabilitation centers. Starting today, a full-scale land and water mobilization will be implemented throughout the city for strict investigation. The Opium Addict Registration Section of the Bureau will send personnel to work with the police stations in various districts to search house by house. The Water Patrol Team, led by Captain Wu Xingbo, will assist in the water areas. It is essential to register all opium addicts within this year and persuade them to quit in stages.</p>
<p>Opium Addicts in the Concessions Should Register Quickly</p>
<p>Regarding opium addicts in the Concession areas, an agreement has been reached with the Concession authorities that opium offenders will be sent to the municipal drug rehabilitation hospital for confinement. After 20 days, they will be sent back to the court for execution. To facilitate poor opium addicts, a simplified method of voluntary registration for poor opium addicts in the Concession areas has been established. Those who have registered have been enthusiastic, but due to the vastness of the area, many are still waiting to see what happens. The Bureau emphasizes that this compulsory registration period will not be extended after it expires. If unregistered opium addicts are found in the future, their travel will be restricted, and the Concession authorities will resolutely assist in strict prohibition. There will be no more opportunities to escape the law. Therefore, it is hoped that opium addicts in the Concession areas will quickly register with the Municipal Public Security Bureau. A liaison office in the Chinese area is sufficient for acceptance. To ensure that opium addicts in the Concession areas deeply understand the importance of opium prohibition, the Bureau has specially arranged for the screening of opium prohibition films in various cinemas and entertainment venues before the main feature. It has also scheduled Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun and Chief Inspector Wang Dasui to take turns broadcasting propaganda on various radio stations within days, hoping that opium addicts residing in the Concession areas will quickly realize the situation.</p>
<h3>US Marines: Shipped to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Bao reports that the US Navy transport ship USS Chaumont arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday morning (the 4th), carrying a number of soldiers from the 4th Marine Regiment stationed in the Far East whose terms have expired. Within a few days, it will sail to Hong Kong and Manila to collect approximately 600 naval soldiers, and then return to the United States via Guam. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Manila before the US-Philippine military exercises. According to sources in the US Navy in Shanghai, these exercises are an annual event. Although the Philippines has been transformed into a republic, the exercises will still be held as usual. The USS Augusta, the flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Manila two weeks ago. Most of the fleet, including submarines and destroyers, has arrived in Manila Bay. For nearly twenty years, these exercises have been held every January. The army usually conducts them in the interior of Luzon, while the navy conducts them along the coast. All available warships will participate. Approximately 10,000 members of the US and Philippine armed forces will participate.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Architectural Chinese Pavilion Plan: Reply to the China Chamber of Commerce Liaison by the Two Chambers of Commerce</h3>
<p>Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the China National Chamber of Commerce, and Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, jointly replied to the Dutch East Indies China Chamber of Commerce Liaison, stating: "Regarding your letter stating that you plan to construct a Chinese pavilion in Batavia, following the Annam model, and hold a national goods exhibition during the night market in August next year, and that you have specially invited Consul General Song to return to China to discuss preparations, this Chamber has convened a meeting of major factories in Shanghai and Consul Song to discuss the matter. As a result, it is generally believed that in this time of extreme decline in Shanghai's industry and commerce, manufacturers are unable to bear the costs of constructing a Chinese pavilion. It is still requested that your Chamber and this Chamber jointly petition the Ministry of Industry for a subsidy. Regarding the invitation to manufacturers to come to the south for the exhibition, this Chamber will convene a meeting of all manufacturers in Shanghai to organize a solicitation committee to prepare for the event. In addition to this Chamber petitioning the Ministry of Industry for funding and convening a meeting of Shanghai manufacturers to discuss progress, this reply is being sent to your Chamber for your information. It is hoped that you will again petition the Ministry of Industry for a subsidy to construct the Chinese pavilion in order to realize the plan. Sincerely yours."</p>

The meeting lasted until 10:30 AM before they left. They then proceeded to the Municipal Government in the city center to pay respects to Mayor Wu. As Mayor Wu was in Beijing attending the First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received them on his behalf. The meeting lasted until 11:30 AM, after which they departed. Prior to the visit, the Security Department specially dispatched a guard of honor to welcome and escort them at the gate of the Municipal Government, according to protocol.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Instructions: Stamping Required for Renewed Extended Contracts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the Zhonghan Glass Factory, instructing that stamping is required for renewed extended contracts. The letter stated: "Regarding your letter asking whether stamp duty should be affixed to mortgage loan extensions, according to Article 9 of the Stamp Duty Law, if a document with already affixed stamp duty is modified due to a change in circumstances and continues to be used, the changed portion should still be supplemented with stamp duty. In this case, your factory and the original mortgagor have agreed to a one-year extension due to the expiration of the original one-year term and the inability to redeem the mortgage. Although it is stated that the previous contract remains valid, the term of the original contract has changed. In fact, a new contract has been established, and the previous contract has lost its validity. The previous stamping of the contract is no longer valid and should be stamped according to Item 19 of the Stamp Duty Law Tax Rate Table.</p>
<h3>Guoyang Representatives Beg for Relief from Drought Disaster</h3>
<p>The Renji Road Chinese and Foreign Relief Society has been actively working on disaster areas along the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and winter relief will continue to be provided to Tianmen in Hubei. However, northern Anhui is uniquely suffering from continuous drought. Ying Shang, Fuyang, Linquan, Taihe, Fengtai, and Mengcheng counties have all reported severe drought and no harvest. Relief is urgently needed. This has been reported in previous news. The Society has now received Mr. Wang Cibin, a representative from Guoyang, who has personally come to Shanghai to beg for assistance, his report is recorded below: "Guoyang has suffered from years of famine, and resources are exhausted. This year is even worse. Since the beginning of summer, the drought demon has ravaged the land, and the autumn crops have been burned to ashes. The entire county of 187,000 acres has no harvest. Even if wheat is replanted, it will take six months. As winter approaches, the famine victims will suffer even more from hunger and cold. Currently, approximately 330,000 people are awaiting relief. We earnestly request that assistance be allocated before the New Year to provide emergency relief, and that work relief be provided in the spring. Your examination and implementation of assistance are requested." Northern Anhui has always been known for its poverty, and now it is suffering from both drought and floods. Winter is also approaching. How can the people survive? It is a pity that people are focusing on the floods and are unaware of the severity of the drought. The greatest virtue is saving lives. It is urgently hoped that all sectors will hear the news and quickly provide assistance.</p>
<h3>China Shipping Mutual Aid Association: Held a General Membership Meeting Yesterday, Electing Executive and Supervisory Committee Members After Reorganization</h3>
<p>The China Shipping Mutual Aid Association has been reorganized by personnel dispatched by the Municipal Party Headquarters for two months. Internal work and member registration have been completed one after another. The General Membership Meeting was held at the Association's headquarters yesterday afternoon. Some of the members are business directors of various Jianghai vessels. Due to their duties, they sent representatives to participate, except for those who were unable to attend in person. The meeting was lively and unprecedented. Shen Huating was elected as Chairman, and Zeng Shanren and Tang Qingpeng were the recorders. The Chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting and the progress of the reorganization. Huang Tiren, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, supervised the voting. As a result of the election, Zhang Yanling, Lang Fukang, Shen Yougeng, Shen Huating, Cao Suchen, Cheng Heng, Liu An, Zheng Renye, and Chen Yanqing were elected as Executive Committee members.

Many proposals from various vessels were discussed. The newly elected Executive and Supervisory Committee members are scheduled to be sworn into office at 3:00 PM on December 10.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Railways Agreed: Both Railways Will Act as Agents for Postal and Telegraph Services</h3>
<p>Measures for Cooperation between the Two Railways and the Shanghai Telegraph and Postal Services; Postal and Telegraph Agencies to be Established at Each Station to Benefit Passengers</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways, in order to facilitate railway passengers sending telegrams and mailing letters at any time, have specifically planned to establish postal and telegraph agencies at each station. Regarding the issue of sending and receiving telegrams, the Railway Administration has discussed the procedures with the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, and they have been officially implemented. Stations such as the Shanghai North Station and the major stations along the two railways have been gradually established. It is now known that the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways have consulted and decided to approve the trial operation. The postal services will be handled jointly by the two railway bureaus and the Shanghai Postal Bureau. Three measures have been decided: (1) Railway stations will establish postal and telegraph agencies. Based on the three conditions proposed by the Ministry of Railways, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways will be the first to trial the operation. (2) The original agreement between the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus and the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau and Postal Bureau to establish railway station postal agencies is consistent with the items proposed by the Ministry of Railways and may be approved for trial operation. (3) The Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways will separately instruct the two railway bureaus and the Shanghai Postal and Telegraph Bureaus to consult.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau: Operating Automobiles at the Xiaguan Station in Beijing; Passengers Will Be Picked Up and Dropped Off by the Public Automobile Company</h3>
<p>The Xiaguan Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is an important transportation hub for passengers. In the past, dozens of cars picked up and dropped off passengers at the station. These cars were operated by various automobile companies in Beijing that were licensed by the Railway Bureau. However, due to the dilapidated equipment and inconsistent management of these companies, the Railway Bureau decided to improve the situation. Last summer, the Nanjing Communications Automobile Company collected various unlicensed "chicken cars" and obtained more than 20 licenses to operate at the Xiaguan Station. After more than a year, the results were not satisfactory. It is said that they also failed to obtain a license from the Ministry of Industry. After investigation, the Bureau terminated their licensed operation at the end of November this year and selected the Beijing Public Automobile Company to send cars to the station to pick up and drop off passengers in accordance with regulations starting on December 1. However, when the public automobiles arrived at the station, the Communications Automobile Company suddenly sent cars to enter the station area and surround the public automobiles, preventing them from operating. At that time, a passenger train arrived, and the railway police on duty, in order to maintain passenger traffic, advised the Communications Automobile Company. The company ignored the advice and sent more cars to rush into the station, injuring a railway policeman. The Bureau detained three drivers involved in the incident and used force to suppress the situation, and the drama was finally settled. Currently, the pick-up and drop-off of passengers at the Xiaguan Station is handled by the Public Automobile Company. It is reported that the company's vehicles are better equipped, and passengers are very satisfied.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Branch of the National Medical Association: Telegram Urges Prompt Promulgation of the Chinese Medicine Regulations; Issue of Equal Treatment for Chinese and Western Medicine</h3>
<p>After the directors of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the National Medical Association took office, they actively carried out various tasks. Recently, they sent a telegram to the First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, stating: "The opening of your meeting is a pivotal event for the central authorities. Your contributions to national construction are admired by all. We are fortunate to read in the newspapers the review report of the proposals of the Fifth Plenary Session, in which the first proposal, 'The government should treat Chinese and Western medicine equally to promote academics and benefit the people,' and the review opinion, 'Whether the Chinese Medicine Regulations should be properly revised is to be discussed and considered by the Central Executive Committee as soon as possible,' are highly appreciated. Medical treatment concerns the lives of the people, regardless of wealth or poverty. It is considered essential and should be based on practical use. There should be no boundaries. In recent years, misunderstandings have led to disputes. There are no established rules for management, and opinions are often biased. Improvements are slow. The chairman and members are compassionate and fair. We hope that the regulations will be promulgated soon so that there is something to follow. We are extremely grateful. Xia Yingtang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the Central National Medical Association, and Deputy Directors Ding Zhongying and Gu Weichuan."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Circle Chunqiu Society telegraphed the First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang a few days ago, stating, "To the Honorable Members of the First Plenary Session in Nanjing, medicine is an academic discipline that protects the health of the nation and has no national boundaries. Chinese medicine has been passed down for thousands of years, and scholars from the East and West have paid close attention to it. However, due to the lack of adequate protection and promotion by the government, it has not been fully developed. The Fifth Plenary Session passed a proposal for 'The government to treat Chinese and Western medicine equally to promote academics and benefit the people.' The Chinese Medicine Regulations were drafted by the Legislative Yuan in December 1933, but the Executive Yuan has not yet promulgated them. Whether this policy is implemented or not has a significant impact on academics and people's livelihood. We request that this matter be promulgated as soon as possible to appease the people. We anxiously await your reply. Zhang Zanchen, Chairman of the Shanghai Medical Circle Chunqiu Society."</p>
<h3>Charitable Organizations Petition the Municipal Government: Increase Subsidies for the Shelter for the Poor and Report on the Progress of the Collective Discussions</h3>
<p>The Federation of Charitable Organizations in Shanghai petitioned the Municipal Government yesterday for funds to operate the Shelter for the Poor. The original text stated, "Regarding the report on the preparations for operating the Shelter for the Poor and requesting an increase in funding, the reason is: The market in Shanghai has declined this year, rural areas are bankrupt, industry and commerce are depressed, and the number of unemployed civilians has increased. In addition, after the floods in various provinces, disaster victims have come to Shanghai in droves, lacking food and clothing and urgently needing relief. The Civilian Shelter for the Poor, which has been established by this Association for many years, should be operated according to the previous case. The Social Affairs Bureau has also sent a letter requesting early preparations. A meeting of various charitable organizations was convened on the 21st of this month to discuss the matter. It was decided to follow the method of the previous year and borrow the Chaozhou Guild Hall on South Railway Station Road as the first shelter and the Chaohui Mountain Villa on Xietu Road as the second shelter. After the two shelters are full, they will be expanded. However, the Chaohui Mountain Villa is currently occupied by a security team. This Association will find a house on behalf of the team and negotiate their relocation. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau will be requested to send personnel to contact the team to facilitate the process. Because the Chaohui Mountain Villa has larger houses, it can accommodate more than 3,000 people. At this time of financial difficulty, it is more economical to concentrate the shelters in one place. Therefore, it is necessary to relocate the security team. The start of admission is expected to be around December 10. If the weather turns cold suddenly, it will be advanced at any time. Currently, the necessary preparations are being made in advance. Regarding the admission expenses, the various charitable organizations pledged to donate approximately 11,000 yuan at the meeting on the 21st. However, according to previous expenses, at least 20,000 yuan is needed. This year, the number of admissions is expected to increase, and the expenses will also increase. The amount pledged by the charitable organizations is far from sufficient, and fundraising is extremely difficult. The Municipal Government allocates 1,000 yuan annually. We earnestly request that the difficult situation this year be considered, which is even more difficult than in previous years. In addition to the allocation according to the previous case, an additional 2,000 yuan is requested. This Association will strive to raise the remaining funds to cope with the situation. In addition to submitting another report when admissions begin on a regular basis, this document is prepared and submitted to you. We hope that you will review and order compliance. Thank you."</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company: Changes to Driving Schedules Starting on the 8th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Taicang Bus Company has recently experienced shorter days. The original scheduled last bus times have resulted in later arrivals, causing inconvenience to passengers. It is reported that starting on December 8, all last buses departing from Shanghai to Liuhang, Shanghai to Jiading, and Liuhang to Shanghai at 5:00 PM will be advanced by half an hour. In addition, the Shanghai to Liuhang bus departing at 3:30 PM will also be advanced by half an hour. The Luodian to Jiading bus departing at 4:20 PM will be changed to 3:50 PM due to connection issues. All other schedules will remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>French Concession: Preparations for Re-election of the Chinese Ratepayers Association</h3>
<p>Standing Committee Meeting</p>
<p>With the re-election of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association imminent, internal work is extremely tense. The Association originally held regular meetings every Saturday, but due to the urgent need to prepare for the election, a temporary meeting of the Standing Committee was convened this afternoon. Attendees included Huang Xianggu, Jin Jingyan, Li Weiliang, Mao Yun, and Zhu Shengmao. Zhang Shishi attended as an observer. The contents of the meeting are summarized as follows: (1) Approval of the election rules, (2) Approval of the budget for the Delegates' Congress, (3) Approval of the hiring of temporary staff, (4) Confirmation of the start of the investigation on December 5, (5) Confirmation of the generation of delegates before December 20, (6) Notification to various groups to elect representatives to attend. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel for Investigation</p>
<p>As the terms of the Chinese Directors, Chinese Committee Members, Executive Committee Members, and Supervisory Committee Members of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association are about to expire, preparations for the re-election are actively underway. The process begins with an investigation. A form has been created, and the area has been divided into districts. The investigation will be carried out separately according to the original plan. All investigators will wear badges made by the Association for identification. Detailed investigation guidelines have been established.</p>

<h3>Organized by Charity Groups: Temporary Shelter Established on the 26th</h3>
<p>Helpless Paupers Request Assistance with Letters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Group Federation, in response to the urgent need to establish a temporary shelter in the Hu Nan area for receiving ordinary people, convened a meeting of various charity groups at the Renji Ying Tang yesterday at 4:00 PM. Attendees included Yu Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Qin Yanqi, Feng Yangshan, Chen Liangyu, Weng Yinchu, Wang Zhongfu, and over twenty others. They resolved to establish the shelter on the first day of the twelfth lunar month (the 26th of this month) and urged the various charity groups to submit their pledged donations as soon as possible to facilitate preparations. Secretary Zhang Ziqi was instructed to expedite the arrangements. It was also reported that yesterday, about two hundred poverty-stricken individuals gathered in front of the Chaozhou Guild Hall, without clothing or food, seeking accommodation. As the shelter was not yet fully prepared, they were politely dissuaded and dispersed. However, some paupers still held letters requesting accommodation. The original text read: "Respectfully submitted, it has come to our attention that every winter, your esteemed institution, out of compassion for the poor, opens a shelter at the Chaozhou Guild Hall near the South Railway Station, providing accommodation to the destitute, preventing unrest and ensuring public safety, which is truly benevolent. We, the poor, have been unemployed for a long time, and have been afflicted by both natural and man-made disasters, one after another, leaving us destitute, with starvation rampant. We have been wandering in Shanghai, unable to make a living. Last year, we were fortunate enough to be accommodated by your institution, allowing us to prolong our lives. Recently, we have been loitering in the streets, exposed to the piercing north wind, suffering unbearable chills. We, the poor, cannot but earnestly request your esteemed institution to open the shelter as soon as possible, as it is a matter of utmost urgency. We, the poor, may then be able to live in peace, and the locality will be tranquil, which would be truly beneficial. Submitted by helpless paupers Li Siquan, Lou Ziyun, Han Hanzhang."</p>

<h3>Local: Snow Pellets Began to Fall Yesterday, Bitter Wind, Freezing Cold, Snow Stopped by Evening with Intermittent Rain</h3>
<p>The local weather, since the beginning of winter, had been extremely warm. The south wind blew gently, as warm as spring. The flowers, grass, trees, and plants in the suburbs showed no signs of withering. The growth of crops and vegetables in the fields was relatively easy. However, insects thrived. Normally, by this deep winter period, even if they were not frozen to death, they would have already hibernated. Now, they remained active, causing significant damage to the fields. Until the end of last week, it gradually turned cold. Yesterday morning, dark clouds gathered, and the sunlight disappeared. The north wind was bitter, and the cold was biting. At around 12 noon, snow pellets suddenly fell, making a pattering sound on the roofs. Later, the snow was mixed with light rain, which continued intermittently until evening. This first snow in the suburbs of Shanghai should be enough to kill pests and benefit farmers.</p>

<h3>Flat-Bed Cart Mutual Aid Society Expresses Opinions on Wheel Modifications</h3>
<p>Requests that the Weight Limit for Vehicles Remain as Previously Agreed and Writes to Police Station to Not Detain Carts Without Reason</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council previously deemed that flat-bed carts and rickshaws hindered traffic and damaged road surfaces and planned to increase vehicle taxes to restrict and ban them. This decision was cancelled only after strenuous negotiations by the local Flat-Bed Cart Industry Mutual Aid Society. Recently, the Municipal Council suddenly issued an order limiting cart owners to modifying their wheels to protect road surfaces. However, the Flat-Bed Cart Industry Mutual Aid Society found the specified design inconvenient for work and increased the burden. Therefore, it notified its members, collected opinions, and decided at a meeting to write to the Municipal Council expressing its opinions and to write to the Lao Zha Police Station to negotiate the issue of the unwarranted expulsion of rickshaws. The original letters are recorded below.</p>
<p>Expressing Opinions on Wheel Modifications</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flat-Bed Cart Industry Mutual Aid Society writes to the Municipal Council expressing its opinions on wheel modifications, stating: "We have recently learned that your esteemed authorities have stipulated that, from July 1st of next year, the wheels of flat-bed carts and rickshaws must be modified to three and a half-inch wide angled iron wheels or two-inch solid rubber tires. Our members are deeply concerned about this. They all say that if three and a half-inch angled iron wheels are installed, they will be clumsy and heavy, making business extremely difficult. Installing rubber tires would also have the same drawbacks. Moreover, at a time when business is sluggish and our members are all on the verge of bankruptcy, they will be unable to modify these new wheels to comply with the regulations, which is even more obvious. However, for the benefit of traffic and the public roads, it is certainly necessary to protect them. After careful review by our association, we would like to express the following opinions to your esteemed bureau regarding the modifications: Flat-bed carts should be modified to three and two-eighths-inch angled iron wheels, and rickshaws to two and two-eighths-inch angled iron wheels. This would both maintain road protection and not hinder the work of cart owners or increase their burden, this is one. Regarding the weight limit for rickshaws, we request that it remain as stipulated in 1925, which stated that a single person could carry 500 pounds and two people could carry 1,000 pounds, which is more suitable and reasonable, this is two. We have always admired your bureau's concern for the hardships of laborers, and we hope that you will adopt, reconsider, and amend these measures for implementation. We would be very grateful. Sincerely, to the General Manager of the Municipal Council."</p>
<p>Requesting No Unwarranted Expulsion of Vehicles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flat-Bed Cart and Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Society also sent a letter to the Lao Zha Police Station yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, we have recently learned that more than twenty rickshaw owners, including Zhang Li Fu and others from the Huichang Association, have reported to our association that, at around 10:00 AM today, while they were resting in the open space in front of the Zhongnan Hotel at the intersection of Edward Road and Hubei Road, they were suddenly expelled without cause by Chinese Constable 1956, and one rickshaw belonging to Zhang Li Fu was detained and sent to the police station, accused of obstructing traffic and fined. This is causing insecurity and livelihood problems. We are requesting that you negotiate with the police station to prevent further unwarranted expulsion and to release the detained vehicles so that they can make a living. After investigation, the open space in front of the Zhongnan Hotel is quite large, and parking vehicles does not obstruct traffic. Cart owners have been parking here for many years and it should not be considered a restricted area. Moreover, since the Municipal Council has not announced a prohibition on parking, it should not be rashly expelled and arrested. If this is considered obstructing traffic, then our flat-bed cart and rickshaw industry will have nowhere to go. This concerns the livelihood of laborers. We dare to ask your esteemed police station to understand the difficulties of the times, immediately release the detained vehicles, and allow cart owners to continue parking and resting in the open space in front of the Zhongnan Hotel, so as to prevent accidents caused by high pressure. We would be very grateful. Sincerely, to the Lao Zha Police Station." It is reported that the police station released the detained vehicle after receiving the letter and allowed the cart owners to continue parking and resting in the original location.</p>
<h3>Another Case of Child Abuse: Mistress's Cruel Methods</h3>
<p>Left Arm of Maid Tied Securely with White Cloth; Right Arm Curled Up, Tied Securely, and Stitched Shut</p>
<p>Li Shaoping, a Cantonese residing on the upper floor of No. 9, Lane 7, Deqing Lane, Muir Road in this city, and his wife, Li Lu, purchased two maids last year, Chun Mei, age eleven, and Lai Xi, age seven, both from Danyang. Li Shaoping runs a tea shop in Hongkou, leaving early and returning late. Li Lu is addicted to mahjong and also goes out frequently. She often beat and abused the two maids, Chun Mei and Lai Xi. On the 3rd of this month (December), a righteous person reported the case to the Chinese Child Welfare Association. The Association immediately sent Zhao Jian, a staff member from the Protection Group, together with Western Detective Harvey and Chinese Detectives Li Wenzhao and Wang Shanqing from the Chengdu Road Police Station, to investigate. Upon entering the room, they saw that Chun Mei had already been tied to the bed leg by Li Lu with a strip of white cloth on her left arm. Her right arm was curled up, tied securely, and stitched shut, making her unable to move from the kneeling position on the ground. Furthermore, she had told the girl that if she tried to stand up and accidentally damaged the stitching, she would be beaten to death. At that time, Western Detective Harvey ordered her to stand up, but the maid did not dare to, fearing that she would be beaten to death by her mistress. Li Shaoping and Li Lu were not at home. The female servant, Pan Xishi, and the two maids were taken to Guangren Hospital for examination. According to the examination, the maid had injuries on her head and arms and was very pitiful. They were immediately taken to the police station for handling. Subsequently, the female servant, Pan Xishi, testified and the two maids confessed that they were often abused by their mistress, Li Lu. Yesterday (the 4th) at 9:00 AM, the female servant, Pan Xishi, and the two maids were escorted to the First Special District Court for questioning. According to the two young maids' testimony, the perpetrators were not present. The court ordered that the two maids be sent to the Jiliang Asylum for care and will be dealt with when Li Shaoping and his wife are detained.</p>
<h3>Widow Dies Miserably After Abortion for Affair with Uncle</h3>
<p>Court Sends Personnel for Autopsy Yesterday; Paramour and Midwife Arrested</p>
<p>Wang Lu, a local widow residing at No. 1, Lane 62, Route Lafayette in the French Concession, is 37 years old. Her husband died more than ten years ago. She has a small amount of assets and vowed to remain a widow. Because she had no children, she adopted a daughter this year, who is fifteen years old. Unexpectedly, although Mrs. Lu is old, she still has charm. Starting a year ago, she suddenly became unwilling to live alone and started an affair with a distant uncle, Wang Xinggen (32 years old this year, with one lame leg, works as a track lever worker No. 34 in the French tram company, usually stationed at the entrance of Baoanfang, Xinqiao Street to manage the shifting of trams on lines 5 and 6). The two became intimate. To facilitate his work, Wang Xinggen rented a spare room from a Ningbo tailor, Li Changgen, at No. 4, Baoanfang, Xinqiao Street, as his residence. Since Wang Xinggen rented a residence outside, Wang Lu took the opportunity to claim that she was going to her mother's home on Hongqiao Road in Shanghai to help take care of her younger brother's wife who was giving birth, as there were too many people in her own home and it was inappropriate. She went to Wang Xinggen's residence for a rendezvous and stayed overnight before going home. Who knew that after several encounters, a fetus had secretly formed in her womb, which had been four months. Her abdomen gradually increased in size. Fearing being exposed, she secretly discussed the matter with her paramour Wang Xinggen. On the morning of the 27th of last month, Wang Xinggen accompanied her to a midwife in Fa Hua Town, north of Xujiahui in western Shanghai, to request an abortion. Mrs. Lu first claimed at home that her younger brother's wife was giving birth and she had to go back to help take care of her. After leaving the house, she went to the paramour's residence. After the midwife gave her medicine, the fetus was aborted. Unexpectedly, the inside was injured. Medical treatment was ineffective. At 1:30 PM on the 3rd, she died in the paramour Wang Xinggen's residence. Wang, seeing the disaster, was at a loss. Therefore, the second landlord, Li Changgen, inquired Wang Xinggen to find out the location of Mrs. Lu's family and went to notify her husband's younger brother, Wang Guanjin, (31 years old this year, previously worked in the Sanitation Department of the French Municipal Council, now works as an accountant at the Republic Automobile Company at 549 Edward Road). He heard that his sister-in-law was helping to take care of her younger brother's wife who was giving birth, and her body was healthy when she left. Why did she suddenly die in Xinqiao Street? He was very strange. First, he went to her mother's house to inquire. They said that she went home the next day and there was nothing unusual. Guanjin then rushed to No. 4, Baoanfang, Xinqiao Street to check and learned that Mrs. Lu had been having an affair with her uncle Wang Xinggen for more than a year and recently died from an abortion due to pregnancy. Wang Guanjin was shocked when he learned the truth and immediately reported to the French Police Station in charge, and sent detective Bu Zhenglong to arrest the adulterer Wang Xinggen. At the same time, the body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for autopsy. Yesterday at noon, he reported to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren and forensic medical officers arrived at the scene, and it was verified that Wang Lu died from an abortion. The case investigator reported the investigation. The official asked Wang Guanjin a question and ordered the body to be handed over to Wang Guanjin for burial. One side, the detective and Wang Xinggen rushed to Fa Hua to find the midwife who performed the abortion and reported to the local Public Security Bureau for assistance to arrest the midwife and take her back to the police station for detention. Today, he will be taken to the Second Special Court for trial along with Wang Xinggen.</p>

<p>Representative Officiation</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Xingya were attending the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Nanjing and were unable to return.

<h3>Destitute and Helpless: Mother and Son Commit Suicide Together</h3>
<p>Mother Addicted to Opium Survives, Son Unable to Resist and Dies</p>
<p>Zhao Wen, a woman from Ningbo, 45 years old this year, married Zhao, a native of the area outside Ximen in Yin County, as a concubine in her early years, and gave birth to a son named Zu'en, 22 years old this year. After Zhao and his first wife died one after another, Zhao Wen discriminated against the eldest son born to the first wife, who was expelled at the age of fifteen. From then on, all the inherited property fell into Zhao Wen's hands. Mrs. Zhao became addicted to smoking and indulged in opium. She did not educate or teach her own son, and let him roam freely. In a few years, the meagre legacy was squandered. Her eldest son, Zuyi, was expelled to Shanghai, completed his apprenticeship, worked diligently in business, and developed year by year, married and started a family. He is now over forty and works as a clerk at the Gold Exchange, residing at No. 198, Xiangfu Lane, Carter Road. The mother and son of Mrs. Zhao ran out of property in their hometown and eked out a living as vendors. Recently, Mrs. Zhao's physical strength has declined with age, so she quit her addiction and stopped working because she could not do it anymore. Her son Zu'en also had no capital to make a living, so the mother and son were always worried and had no face to see her eldest son and daughter-in-law to ask for help. Also, because the weather was getting colder, their clothes were thin, and they were starving. They wandered to Shanghai and could not find a way to make a living. The mother and son committed suicide on the 2nd at night. They bought four boxes of raw opium worth two jiao a box with their remaining capital. That night at 11 o'clock, they went to the Xinxin Hotel at No. 138, West Zilai Huo Street in the French Concession. The mother and son used aliases. Zhao Zu'en changed his name to Zhao A Da and Mrs. Zhao changed her name to Wang Wen. They checked into Room 10 on the pretext of borrowing a room to stay overnight, and swallowed half of the four boxes of raw opium each to commit suicide. After taking the poison, Zu'en wrote a suicide note in pencil to the hotel owner and newspaper reporters, stating that the mother and son committed suicide at the same time because of the long period of poverty due to the brother not providing assistance. After his death, please notify his brother to buy two coffins for burial. After writing, he lay on the bed waiting to die. By the afternoon of the next day, Zu'en died from the poison. Mrs. Zhao was originally an addict and could resist the force of two boxes of opium, which was not enough to kill her. By 6:00 PM the next evening, Mrs. Zhao woke up from the poison and saw that her son was dead, but she had not died. Seeing her son's tragic state, she couldn't help but cry loudly in the room. The tea room waiter Tan Fuxian went upstairs to inquire and learned that the mother and son had taken poison and the son had died. He immediately reported to the French Police Station and sent detectives to investigate. Mrs. Zhao cried and refused to tell the reason for the suicide. Later, a suicide note was found, and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for an autopsy. Zhao Wen was taken to the police station. According to the address on the suicide note, her eldest son Zhao Zuyi was notified, and his wife Zhao Wang came to the police station for questioning. After questioning, they learned that Mrs. Zhao and her son committed suicide in the world, and ordered Mrs. Wang to take her concubine home. At first, Mrs. Wang refused to take her, but after the detective's persuasion, Mrs. Zhao was taken away and went to the autopsy station the next day to wait for the hearing to collect the body. Yesterday, the police reported to the Second Special Court, and Prosecutor Wang Ren and the medical examiner arrived at the station at noon to verify that Zhao Zu'en, Zhao A Da, committed suicide by poisoning. The body was handed over to Zhao Wang and Zhao Wen for burial.</p>
<h3>The Chief of the 60th Division's Communications Office Embezzles Over 70,000 Yuan, Flees to Shanghai with a Prostitute for a Life of Pleasure, Then Meets Another Prostitute and Spends Money Like Water, Enjoying Himself Immensely, Truly Embodying the Spirit of "Amassing Hundreds of Thousands and Riding a Crane to Yangzhou," but the Revelry Is Short-Lived as the Crime Is Discovered and He Is Arrested</h3>
<p>Lin Chengwei, a Guangdong native, currently twenty-two years old, served as the chief of the Sichuan communications office of the 16th Division of the National Revolutionary Army. On the 28th of last month, Lin stole a seal belonging to Pan Wei-fu, the chief of the division's quartermaster department, in Chengdu, Sichuan, along with a blank check. After fraudulently obtaining 76,000 yuan from the Chengdu branch of the China Farmers' Bank, he immediately purchased two plane tickets on the 30th of the same month with a Sichuan woman named Wang Yuqing (age 19), using the alias Liu Sheng. They flew to Shanghai, renting room 309 at the Great Eastern Hotel on Yinghua Street, Nanjing Road, in the Public Concession, still using the name Liu Sheng. However, Lin Chengwei, having</p>
<p>Embezzled a Huge Sum,</p>
<p>deposited 50,000 yuan in the Juxingcheng Bank on Jiujiang Road. He kept the rest close by, spending it recklessly, indulging in the pleasures of theaters, dance halls, and women all day long. He believed he was beyond the reach of the law and could live happily ever after. Guo Shengzhao, a tea boy at the hotel, seeing Lin's extravagance and lavish spending, regarded him as a wealthy benefactor and became obsequious, even introducing him to a local prostitute named Jiang Yueying to keep him company, agreeing on a daily fee of 20 yuan. Lin, finding Jiang</p>
<p>Quite Beautiful, Was Pleased.</p>
<p>In addition to renting room 429 at the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road as a place to enjoy himself with Jiang, he also rented a car, number 18017, from the Huali Motor Company nearby for transportation, to show off his wealth, paying 18 yuan per day in car fare. He and Jiang went out to play together, and to please Jiang, he bought her a gold bracelet and a diamond-studded platinum watch as gifts. He enjoyed himself immensely, showing off his wealth. Unexpectedly, Lin's actions had been exposed in Sichuan, discovered by Pan Wei-fu, the chief of the quartermaster department, who</p>
<p>Telegraphed the Division's</p>
<p>office in Nanjing. The director of that office, Wu Xiangrong, reported to Chen Pei, the commander of the 60th Division, who ordered a strict search. At the same time, he checked with the Chengdu branch of the China Aviation Corporation and confirmed that a person named Liu Sheng, accompanied by a woman, had flown to Shanghai. Director Wu then tracked them to Shanghai and reported to the Shanghai Municipal Police, requesting assistance in the investigation. He also worked with Huang Peilin, the head of the detective team, and detectives Gao Quchuan and Cai Baotai, first investigating at Hongqiao Airport, where it was confirmed that Liu Sheng had arrived in Shanghai by plane. They then began a secret search of the various</p>
<p>Hotels in the Foreign Concession.</p>
<p>Until the night before last, when they searched the Great Eastern Hotel and found a person named Liu Sheng in room 309. However, at that time, they learned that Lin was with Jiang and the tea boy Guo Shengzhao, watching a play at the Grand Guangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. At 11 p.m., they cooperated with Ding Huaguo, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Patrol Station, and arrested Lin Chengwei, Jiang Yueying, and Guo Shengzhao at the entrance of the Grand Guangming. They found 4,113.40 yuan in cash on Lin, as well as a</p>
<p>Bank Draft for 50,000 Yuan</p>
<p>from the Shanghai Juxingcheng Bank.</p>
<p>They also arrested Wang Yuqing at the Great Eastern Hotel. During the search, they found 14,850 yuan in cash in her suitcase, as well as Pan Wei-fu's seal and the gold bracelet and watch on Jiang's person. All were taken to the Xinzha Patrol Station. After investigation by the chief, Jiang Yueying and Guo Shengzhao were found to be uninvolved and were released. Lin and Wang were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the patrol station's lawyer, stated the above facts and did not oppose the Shanghai Municipal Police's request</p>
<p>To Transfer the Case.</p>
<p>According to Wu Xiangrong, the director of the 60th Division's Nanjing office, and a detective from the Shanghai Municipal Police who had turned himself in, a request was made to transfer the case. When questioned, Lin Chengwei confessed that he had committed the crime in Sichuan with a woman named Li Yueying, who received 1,500 yuan. However, he claimed that Wang Yuqing was a prostitute from Sichuan and knew nothing about the matter. Judge Wu Zehan briefly questioned Wang and then ordered that Lin Chengwei be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Police detectives to be taken back. The evidence was also transferred. Wang Yuqing was also allowed to be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Police to be taken back.</p>
<h3>Defaulting on Goods Delivered and Pawned, the Store Announces Liquidation, and Ye Chuanhan and Others Surrender to the Patrol Station and Are Detained.</h3>
<p>Ye Chuanhan and Yu Lanxin, natives of Ningbo, jointly opened the Qiafeng Department Store at No. 7, Donghuali, Tangshan Road. Recently, they had ordered goods worth 1,452.06 yuan from the Yisheng Weaving Factory at No. 47, Yongchengli, East Broadway Road, and goods worth 312 yuan from the Rongji Store in Yongfengfang, North Sichuan Road. After Ye and others obtained the goods, they pawned them at various pawnshops to convert them into cash. On the first of this month, they announced liquidation. The Yisheng Factory and others reported the matter to the Huishan Patrol Station. Chinese Detective Cai Liu and Detective Xu Decheng investigated. The day before yesterday, Ye and Yu, accompanied by a lawyer, surrendered to the patrol station and were detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Jiang Baolian, the patrol station's lawyer, stated that the two defendants, Ye and Yu, had never ordered more than 100 yuan worth of goods from Yisheng and others before. However, starting from October 20th, they continuously ordered goods, up to four times. The value of the goods from Yisheng exceeded 1,400 yuan, and the value of the goods from Rongji also exceeded 300 yuan. In addition, there were five or six other businesses from which goods had been obtained, with a total value of about 4,000 yuan. The defendants pawned goods worth over 3,000 yuan for over 1,000 yuan. The pawn tickets were taken away by a Zhao Yongkang, who has been detained by the French Concession police for fraud. As the case requires detailed investigation, no charges have been filed, and a request is made to allow detention. The lawyer hired by Ye and others stated that the liquidation of Qiafeng was due to the inability to maintain operations and that there was no fraud. On the 26th of last month, over 1,600 yuan was paid for goods. If there was intent to defraud, why not close down before the 20th, which would have resulted in an additional profit of over 1,000 yuan, rather than going bankrupt on the first of this month, and so on. Judge Zhan Liangce briefly questioned Ye and Yu and ordered that the case be heard again in a week.</p>

According to his testimony, he and the plaintiff and defendant were all neighbors. This time, Song's daughter was entrusted to Yang Shengji, which I introduced. The court immediately presented the guarantee written on red paper and asked if the signature under the guarantor's name was signed by him. He replied that it was indeed his signature, but at the time, the defendant said it was a betrothal certificate and did not know it was a guarantee. The defendant, Yang Shengji, immediately attacked the witness, claiming that she was the daughter of the plaintiff, Song Guisheng, from a different mother, but both Song Guisheng and Yang Shengji denied it, saying that because they were neighbors, they called each other "godfather" and "godmother" but had no father-daughter relationship. The court, with the facts clear, ordered the start of the debate. After mutual debate by the lawyers of the two sides, Judge Jiang immediately announced the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for next week.</p>

<h3>The Trial of the Tang Akun Murder Case Concludes</h3>
<p>Tang Akun, a local resident living at No. 491, Kangnaotuo Road, West Shanghai, was walking with his friend Yan Shengquan near the Yan Family House on Difeng Road last winter when he was hacked to death with an ax. Later, the family of the deceased filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office of the local court, stating that Tang Akun was murdered by Yan Shengjing, who had arranged for Zhao Arer and others to wait for him on the road. The court, after receiving the complaint, ordered the arrest of the criminals, but they could not be found. Recently, Yan secretly returned to Shanghai and was sent to the local court by the police. After investigation by Prosecutor Xie, it was determined that he was guilty of murder and prosecuted in the criminal court. Judge Wu Deying has presided over several trials, but the case has not been concluded, as detailed in previous reports. It is learned that the case was heard again yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM by Judge Wu. Tang Jishi, the plaintiff, appeared in court and stated that the deceased was her husband and requested that the law be enforced and that private compensation of 7,600 yuan be sought.

<h3>Disturbance at the Da Hu Hotel Last Night</h3>
<p>Gathering in a Room and Teasing Women, Ignoring Warnings and Beating Up the Inspector</p>
<p>A guest checked into a room at the Da Hu Hotel on Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession yesterday afternoon. The hotel assigned him room 411 on the fourth floor. In the evening, a large group of men came to the room, shouting and making a lot of noise. The hotel was afraid that the people were too mixed and would cause trouble, so they instructed the tea boys to pay extra attention. At around 9:30 PM, three men in plain clothes were loitering in the lobby of the floor, teasing women coming in and out. The tea boys felt that this was offensive to public morals and tried to persuade them to stop. Unexpectedly, the three men not only refused but even made things difficult for the tea boys and went straight up to the sixth floor, automatically breaking into room 608, which caused a commotion. The accountant downstairs heard the noise and ordered Sun Zhaobei, the hotel's inspector, to go upstairs to mediate. However, the men continued to act unreasonably and ran back to room 411, calling the others in the room to rush to the lobby. They attacked the inspector without asking questions, causing Sun Zhaobei to be beaten. Seeing this, the accountant urgently notified the Daziwuzhong Patrol Station, which sent detectives to the scene and arrested all those who had caused the trouble, including Xue Hesheng, Hu Yigong, and others, totaling six people. After questioning by the patrol station, they were transferred to the Lujiawan Patrol Station on the grounds that the case involved a mob causing trouble and disrupting public order, and were scheduled to be sent to court this morning.

<h3>The Dongya Paint Factory Creates National Lithopone</h3>
<p>Lithopone is the English name for lithopone, commonly known as "foreign zinc white," which is a major raw material for paints, coatings, painted cloth, and rubber. Its use is very broad. The goods have been imported from overseas, and the outflow of money is alarming. Gao Enhong, the former Minister of Communications, in view of this, gathered comrades to establish the Dongya Paint Factory to manufacture Taiji brand lithopone from domestic raw materials. Through long-term research and gradual refinement, it has surpassed imported products. The goods are divided into six grades: 12 degrees, 15 degrees, 22 degrees, 30 degrees, 40 degrees, and 50 degrees. The grades are very accurate, and the powder is very fine and white, which is in line with the needs of the industrial community. It is truly an excellent and complete national product. Now, the factory has entrusted the Tongrenhe Paint Sundries Store at No. 80, Minguo Road, as the sole distributor for promotion. It is heard that the Tongrenhe Store was established more than 80 years ago and is the pioneer of the paint and sundries industry. It also has a branch, Tongtaixiang, on Minguo Road, which has a history of more than 30 years. The store is famous far and wide for its complete range of styles and fair prices. In the past, it sold Tiger brand lithopone manufactured by a German factory, which had a wide sales network. Now, in order to promote national goods, it also sells Dongya lithopone. The factory has promoted the right people, and its future achievements will be remarkable, which is also a blessing for national goods.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have read the article in the "Local News" section of your newspaper on the 3rd of this month entitled "Kangti Road Vegetable Vendors Provisionally Allowed to Set Up Stalls by the French Concession Public Works Department." It includes the following passage: "The stallholders publicly elected three representatives, including Zhou Wenxian, to bring a petition to Mr. Lu Bohong of the Chinese Directorate. Mr. Lu personally met with them and immediately telephoned the French Concession Public Works Department to discuss the matter with Director Wei Zhiren. The department agreed to temporarily allow the vendors to set up stalls before the market is built to provide relief, etc." This is not in accordance with the facts.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, representatives of the Kangti Road vegetable vendors came to petition. I telephoned Director Wei to ask how to handle the matter. Director Wei replied that the case should be handled by the relevant police station. I immediately informed the representatives accordingly. There was no mention of "agreeing to temporarily allow the vendors to set up stalls before the market is built to provide relief." I am deeply concerned that this might cause confusion. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lu Bohong</p>

In 1926, cotton fabric still held the top position among imports, totaling 268.1 million national currency. From 1930, it fell to second place, totaling 102.2 million national currency. It maintained its original position in 1931, but the amount decreased to 167.1 million national currency. In 1932, it further dropped to third place, totaling 110 million national currency. In 1933, it dropped to seventh place, totaling 58.2 million national currency. In 1934, it fell below tenth place, totaling 13.1 million national currency. The import of cotton fabric, in the span of eight years, dropped from first place to below tenth place, with the amount decreasing sharply from 268.1 million national currency to 13.1 million national currency. Therefore, many people are gleeful, believing that our country's cotton weaving industry has made considerable progress. However, upon closer examination, we should not be overly optimistic. The sharp decline in cotton fabric imports is due to the following two major reasons, in addition to the genuine progress made by the national textile industry.</p>
<p>(1) The Sharp Increase in Foreign Factories in China. As capitalism develops to the stage of imperialism, its economic aggression towards colonies and semi-colonies has further shifted from "commodity export" to "capital export." Since Britain and Japan have already occupied a considerable advantage in China's cotton fabric market and have also obtained concession privileges, it is inevitable that they will set up factories in China. Setting up factories locally allows them to utilize cheap Chinese labor, reduce tariffs and transportation costs, and lower the cost of cotton fabric to a minimum in order to increase their sales power. According to statistics, the most textile factories set up by Britain and Japan in China are in Shanghai. There are three British factories and thirty Japanese factories. Their scale and capital are far beyond the reach of Chinese factories. According to the figures surveyed by the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association in March of this year, the comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>Percentage Occupied by Chinese Factories Percentage Occupied by Japanese Factories Percentage Occupied by British Factories Total</p>
<p>Looms 47.96 45.90 6.14 100</p>
<p>Based on the above table, the number of looms in Chinese factories is already less than that in Japanese factories, which shows the erosion of Chinese factories and the continuous progress of Japanese factories in recent years. As foreign factories in China become increasingly developed, cotton fabric imports may see a sharp decline, but the outflow of our country's resources remains the same.</p>
<p>(2) Decline in Purchasing Power. Cotton fabric is the main clothing material for Chinese civilians. The increase or decrease in cotton fabric consumption reflects the rise and fall of civilian life. In recent years, the rural economy has collapsed, cities have declined, and civilians are struggling with poverty and cannot even afford food, let alone clothing. Therefore, the purchasing power of cotton fabric has been greatly reduced. The output of local factories is already greater than the demand, and foreign imports must be drastically reduced. The import numbers of cotton fabric from Shanghai in the past three years are listed for comparison as follows. (Unit: 1,000 Customs Gold Units)</p>
<p>Port 1932 Percentage 1933 Percentage 1934 Percentage</p>
<p>Shanghai 17,062 27.68 13,600 45.60 6,953 51.01</p>
<p>Other 44,566 72.32 16,222 54.40 6,678 48.99</p>
<p>Total 61,628 100.00 29,822 100.00 13,631 100.00</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be observed that cotton fabric imports have decreased year by year in Shanghai and other ports, and the degree of decrease is more severe in other ports than in Shanghai. This indicates that the decline in consumption power of civilians in the interior is more drastic than in the coastal provinces.</p>
<p>In addition, the fall of the four northeastern provinces has also led to a sharp decline in our country's cotton fabric import volume. Since the "September 18th" incident, the northeastern market has been exclusively occupied by Japanese goods, eliminating the need for re-export through Tianjin and Shanghai.</p>
<p>5.  Inventory Situation</p>
<p>The cotton fabric industry in Shanghai mainly deals in machine-woven cotton fabric. Its sources of inventory have changed considerably over the years. In the past, it relied heavily on foreign firms that engaged in import businesses. In recent years, as textile and dyeing factories have become increasingly developed in this city and neighboring counties, locally produced goods have been sufficient to meet the needs. Therefore, the sources of inventory are significantly different from before. According to statistics from the Shanghai Cotton Fabric Industry Association, in the first half of this year, approximately 95% of the inventory came from textile and dyeing factories, and approximately 5% came from foreign firms engaged in import businesses. The breakdown by country of origin is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Domestic Goods. This year, the average daily sales of domestically produced plain cotton fabric in the city's cotton fabric industry during the first half of the year were approximately 10,000 pieces, and the sales of colored fabric were approximately 3,000 to 4,000 pieces. Compared with the same period last year, some decreased by 10-20%, and others decreased by 20-30%. As of May of this year, the city's inventory was approximately 34,000 to 35,000 pieces of plain cotton fabric and 22,000 to 23,000 pieces of colored fabric.</p>
<p>(2) Western Goods. As of May of this year, Shanghai only imported approximately 3,000 pieces of Western goods. Among them, foreign yarn and linen yarn accounted for approximately 500-600 pieces, poplin and tarpaulin accounted for approximately 200 pieces, bleached cloth, Western satin, feather satin, red labels, and printed cloth accounted for approximately 1,400 pieces, flannel accounted for approximately 400-500 pieces, and grey cloth and muslin accounted for approximately 200-300 pieces. If we include the unsold inventory from the previous year, the city's total inventory is approximately 3,000 pieces. The total sales volume is only one-tenth of that in 1932, and the rate of decline is truly alarming. In addition to the existing inventory of more than 2,000 pieces, Shanghai imported approximately 200 pieces of Russian printed cloth this spring. However, the lightweight cloth produced by the British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill in China is still selling in the market, with a daily output of approximately 200 pieces and an inventory of more than 4,000 pieces in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) Japanese Goods. Since the increase in customs duties last year, Japanese goods such as five-branch worsted cloth, single-ply serge, and printed cloth have no longer been imported. However, printed goods such as colored jacquard, printed jacquard, star flannel, modern crepe, snowflake small-grid serge, and mass-market goods such as plain feather satin, eight-piece satin-faced jacquard, eight-piece jacquard satin, double-width umbrella-faced feather satin, Zhongshan flannel, plain foreign yarn, moon velvet, and cotton flannel are still imported, totaling approximately 12,000 to 13,000 pieces. It is also said that Japanese merchants are cutting the original pieces of cotton fabric into smaller pieces and declaring them as remnants for import in order to reduce customs duties. In recent years, this type of remnants has flooded the markets in northern China. The general public is competing to buy them because of their low prices. This trend is also increasing in the southern ports. If no measures are taken to curb this, its impact on the future of domestic cloth will be significant. As for the products manufactured in Shanghai factories, in addition to five-branch jacquard, single-ply serge, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, market cloth, printed cloth, eight-sided cloth, and printed jacquard, the most common are muslin, twill, and unbleached cloth. The daily output is approximately 20,000 pieces, and the inventory in Shanghai is approximately 10,000 pieces. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Educational Circles in Peiping Telegraph Support for the Central Government</h3>
<p>Chinese and History Textbooks for Primary and Secondary Schools Will Be Revised to Avoid Hindering Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) The educational circles in Peiping are affected by the current situation. Some university students have requested leave, and some have staged city tours. Although the principals of various schools have repeatedly advised them, it is difficult to cope with the environment. Lei Sichang, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, has decided to automatically revise the Chinese and history textbooks for primary and secondary schools to express the intention of not hindering diplomatic relations. The principals of the four national universities and leaders of cultural and educational circles have sent out a telegram expressing that the people of all circles have no intention of breaking away from the Central Government and seeking autonomy. Bai Lafei, Dean of the College of Law and Commerce of Peiping University, and Xu Shoushang, Dean of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences, represented Principal Xu Songming to go to Beijing to contact the Ministry of Education. Bai returned to Peiping today (the 3rd), and Xu will return north a few days later. Li Zheng, President of National Peiping Normal University, in order to stabilize the students' emotions, also convened a student meeting to report on the current situation. The situation of each party is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from Educational Leaders</p>
<p>The principals of various universities in Peiping and leaders of the educational and cultural circles have issued a telegram expressing their attitude towards the current situation. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Recently, newspapers in Peiping and Tianjin have published articles openly claiming that there is public opinion in North China demanding autonomy or self-determination. This is sufficient to confuse the public. What we have personally seen and heard is that, apart from a few villains on the street who have been used by others to issue leaflets and fabricate public opinion, the people of all circles have no intention of breaking away from the Central Government and seeking autonomy. We hope that the government and the people of the country will not be deceived. We especially hope that the central government and the authorities in Peiping, Tianjin, and Hebei will eliminate the source of chaos and use all their strength to maintain the integrity of the country's territory and administration." Xu Songming, Li Zheng, Jiang Menglin, Mei Yiqi, Lu Zhiwei, Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, Yuan Tongli, Tao Mengzhi, Liu Yunchou, Liu Tingfang, Yang Likui, Wu Wenzao, Zha Liangzhao, Zhang Xiruo, Zhou Binglin, Jiang Tingfu, and dozens of others.</p>
<p>Dean Bai's Talk After Returning to Peiping</p>
<p>Bai Pengfei, Dean of the College of Law and Commerce of National Peiping University, and Xu Shoushang, Dean of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences, previously represented Xu Songming, President of Peiping University. They took the Peiping-Shanghai train south on the 27th of last month to go to Beijing to discuss important school affairs with the Ministry of Education. Some progress has been made in Beijing. Except for Xu, who is still staying in Beijing to continue handling unfinished matters, Bai Pengfei took the Peiping-Shanghai train back to Peiping at 10:24 this morning. The reporter met Bai at the station and asked about the trip. According to Bai, after arriving in Beijing with Dean Xu (Shoushang), they first visited Wang Shijie, Minister of Education, to discuss Peiping University's school affairs and ask for instructions on everything. They talked for more than three hours. Minister Wang instructed them to tell the students to study with peace of mind. Dean Xu had matters to discuss and decided to return north tomorrow, and it is expected that he will arrive in Peiping on Friday. Then Bai left the station with his wife and welcomers, took a car back to his private residence, rested for a while, and then visited Xu Songming, President of Peiping University, to report on the trip to the south.</p>
<p>Li Zheng Advises Students</p>
<p>Li Zheng, President of National Normal University, convened a student meeting today to make a speech and report on the current situation. He said that the current situation in North China is showing an extremely urgent trend. The authorities in charge in Peiping and Tianjin are struggling to support it, which is admirable. He Yingqin's coming north is hoped to break the current situation. Commander Song (Zheyuan) expressed his firm responsibility for local security, so there should be no problem. The students are naturally worried about the urgency of the situation. At this time of crisis, the actions of university students must be more cautious. Any opinions can be discussed with the school at any time to maintain close contact. Do not take any rash actions that may lead to unexpected disputes. At this critical time, if students have any opinions, they must consult with the school and take responsibility together. Thoughts and actions must be calm and cool to get through this crisis.</p>
<p>Revision of Teaching Materials in Various Schools</p>
<p>There are more than 200 primary and secondary schools and more than 80,000 students in Peiping. The teaching materials of Chinese and history in various schools are related to diplomatic relations. Lei Sichang, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, is responsible for the education of Peiping. He will carefully review the teaching materials of Chinese and history used in various schools. If there are any statements that hinder diplomatic relations, they will be revised to comply with the law. It is heard that this matter is now underway and will soon be seen in fact.</p>

<p>Children's Education Novel</p>
<h3>Little Boy</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Another long trek in the quickly deepening twilight, another deep disappointment, because when they reached the tree, they saw that it was not the one Neidai had climbed before. Looking around, they could not find a path.</p>
<p>"Are we lost?" Robert asked with a trembling voice. In despair, he couldn't help but hug his little bucket tighter.</p>
<p>"Not too bad yet. I just don't know which way to go. I think we should try shouting."</p>
<p>So the two of them shouted together until their throats were hoarse, but there was no response. Only the frogs in the wilderness competed in a chorus of croaking sounds.</p>
<p>Lai tried hard to muster courage, but her heart felt like it was sinking.</p>
<p>"I don't think I can walk anymore; my boots are so heavy, I can't drag them anymore," Robert said, and then sat on a stone, truly exhausted.</p>
<p>"Then we'll just have to stay here all night. I'm not too worried, as long as snakes don't come."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid of snakes. I can't stay here all night. Oh, I really don't want to be lost," Bob said, pouting his face and crying. Suddenly, an idea came to him, so he said with a very confident tone:</p>
<p>"Mommy will come and find me, she always does; I'm not afraid now."</p>
<p>"She won't know where we are."</p>
<p>"She didn't know I was locked in the icehouse, but she found me. I know she will come," Robert replied, saying it so confidently that Nan'en felt a lot more relieved, just sitting by his side, but still couldn't help but regret it, sighing and saying:</p>
<p>"We really shouldn't have wandered off."</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Inter-University Cross-Country Race: Fudan Wins Championship, Jinan Second, Guanghua Absent Yesterday, Jinan's Li Jiqing First Individually</h3>
<p>The Jiangda Sports Association's 9th Cross-Country Race was held at National Jinan University in Zhenru at 12:00 noon yesterday. Guanghua withdrew due to circumstances. Only Jinan and Fudan participated. As a result, Jinan's Li Qingji finished first with a time of 18 minutes and 20 seconds, and Fudan also won the championship with a strong team. In total, Fudan scored 32 points and Jinan scored 46 points. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Silver Whistle Signals Athletes Forward</p>
<p>At 12:00 noon yesterday, all team members gathered at the back gate of Jinan University, including seven from Fudan (including No. 4 Zhang Huiyuan, who joined as a guest and was not scored) and six from Jinan. The Jinan Boy Scouts maintained order, led by Chen Bingde leading several Boy Scouts. Shen Kunnan gave the signal, and with a silver whistle, the athletes rushed forward. Yang Qingxie, Lan Shijie, Chen Tianru, and others led the way. The ground was overgrown with weeds, the road was rugged, and there was a lot of accumulated water, so they all dragged through the mud and water. At this time, Lan Shijie quickened his pace and took the lead, followed by Yang Qingxie. Li Jiqing also caught up to third place. The other athletes followed closely behind.</p>
<p>Li Jiqing Bravely Takes the Lead</p>
<p>As they advanced to Gujiazhai, the road gradually became flat. Jinan's Li Qingji began to stand out, catching up from second to first place, and took the lead. When passing Jiaotong Road, Li Qingji was in the lead, Yang Qingxie had passed Lan Shijie and was in second place, and Zheng Boyi was also closely ranked fourth. The distances between each person were very close, only three or four meters apart, while the rest were far behind. Afterwards, Li Qingji ran faster and faster, and Yang Qingxie could not surpass him. Until the front gate of Jinan University, Li finished first with a time of 18 minutes and 20 seconds, Yang Qingxie was second, about 35 feet behind, Lan Shijie was third, and Zheng Boyi was fourth, with similar distances. The fifth place and beyond were far behind.</p>
<p>Fudan Wins This Year's Championship</p>
<p>The referee at the finish line, Yu Hengzhi, and all the referees determined the rankings. Except for Fudan's Zhang Huiyuan, who was not scored, the rest were announced in order.

<h3>Yesterday Evening's Xiqing Basketball: John Loses to Pirates, 22 to 60</h3>
<p>In yesterday's Xiqing basketball match, the Pirates played against John, and the situation was very tense. Almost all of John's classmates turned out to cheer them on, and the venue was packed with people, creating a lively atmosphere. However, John was unable to hold on for even ten minutes. Their main player, Xu Wenkui, committed four fouls and had to leave the court, leading to a collapse. The final score was 60 to 22, a crushing defeat for John. In the two Group B matches, (1) Guoguang narrowly defeated Jewish, with the score at 11 to 6 in the first half, and tied at 17 to 17 in the second half, winning with considerable effort, (2) Yuezhong lost to Moore, with the score at 13 to 8 in the first half. Moore made many long-range shots, Yuezhong's formation was chaotic, and their skills were indeed inferior. There are no matches tonight. The results from last night and the Group A match are described below:</p>
<p>Moore Defeats Yuezhong (Group B): Result 34 to 19</p>
<p>Guoguang Defeats Jewish (Group B): Result 22 to 18</p>
<p>Pirates Defeats John (Group A): Result 60 to 22</p>
<p>After the Group B matches, John and the Pirates took to the court for the Group A match, which began amidst enthusiastic applause. The first five minutes were extremely tense, with a lot of physical play. Xu Wenkui scored one point from a free throw, opening the scoring. The Pirates added two points in a row, and after Wang Zhengge scored, John took a 3 to 2 lead. After that, the situation changed immediately. The Pirates implemented a pressing defense and were full of momentum. In a short time, the score became 15 to 5. Because John's players were eager to win, they accumulated fouls. Main player Xu Wenkui was penalized off the court at that time, and the situation became impossible to salvage. The score at halftime was 33 to 9. In the second half, John's formation became even more disorganized, and the final result was 60 to 22. Watching the Pirates' performance yesterday, new player Pi Xier was exceptionally brave and skillful, and his brilliance was no less than Carson's. The team's performance was even more organized than last year.</p>

<h3>9th Public Exhibition Cup International Handball: China Retains Championship</h3>
<p>China Wins Both Cycles; Yesterday's Doubles Also Defeats Westerners 3-2</p>
<p>In the 9th International Public Exhibition Cup Handball Tournament, China won the first cycle. In the second cycle's singles matches, China also took the lead with a score of 7 to 3. In the five doubles matches, China only needed to win one to win the championship. In yesterday's five doubles matches, except for Zhu Kuan and Sun Daosheng's team withdrawing due to Mr. Sun's wife's illness, the other four teams appeared on time. As a result, China lived up to expectations and won 3 to 2. The championship was safely retained. This must be attributed to the efforts of all the team members. Unfortunately, Yan Zhaorong and Huang Kesu lost yesterday's match, otherwise they could have achieved a complete victory.</p>
<p>Westerners Were Weak and Unable to Attack</p>
<p>The fourth team took to the court first, with China's Cai Tongshou and Hua Gangfeng facing Westerners Ke Xuna and Nengke Lieb. Cai and Hua coordinated wonderfully, and their offense and defense were well-coordinated. The Westerners were outwitted by Tongshou's intelligence and defeated step by step by Fenggang's bravery, and were at a loss. Therefore, Cai and Hua's victory was effortless, and the Westerners were truly unable to attack.</p>
<p>Yan and Huang's Defeat Was a Great Pity</p>
<p>Lai Jin and Gai Siden were strong players on the Western team, with strong strength. They had been practicing hard recently, and their teamwork was improving. The Chinese players Yan Zhaorong and Huang Kesu were also not weak, and their coordination had become very skillful. Therefore, when the two sides met, the battle became even more intense, and the score was closer than ever before. However, in the final two points of the critical moment, Yan and Huang ultimately missed the opportunity, leading to their defeat, which was a great pity.</p>
<p>The Second Team Match Was Fiercely Contested</p>
<p>The second team consisted of Sun Jialu and He Shuoqing, facing Andrew and Smith. The strengths of the two teams were equal, and the battle was particularly fierce. After the Chinese team took to the court, their momentum was very strong, and they won the first game with a large score of 21 to 9. In the second game, Andrew and Smith tried their best to counterattack, and their arm kills were often effective. Sun and He also responded in kind, but unfortunately lost too many points and failed. In the critical moment of the third game, Sun and He dared not let go easily, and attacked step by step, finally winning.</p>
<p>Gao and Sun Won with a Final Effort</p>
<p>Gao Zishou and Sun Baoqi's ball-striking skills have always been known for their excellence, and their coordination is also good. However, the Westerners Ke Laiman and Ge Linna played many risky balls yesterday, and were very evenly matched against the Chinese team Sun and Gao. The scores were also very close. Although the Chinese team lost the second game, they won thanks to their final effort, and victory ultimately belonged to Sun and Gao. The results of each team are recorded below:</p>
<p>Fourth Team Cai Tongshou Fenggang 21-10 21-4 Ke Xuna Nengke Lieb</p>
<p>Third Team Yan Zhaorong Huang Kesuo 22-20 22-20 Lai Jin Gai Siden</p>
<p>Second Team Sun Jialu He Shuoqing 21-9 19-21 21-16 Andrew Smith</p>
<p>Fifth Team Sun Baoqi Gao Zishou 21-19 16-21 21-7 Ke Laiman Ge Linna</p>
<p>First Team Zhu Kuan Sun Daosheng (Withdrew) 0-2 Hao Keli Bao Shulai</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market Does Not Break Out of Range-Bound Situation</h3>
<p>Midday Difference of Three and a Half Yuan; Ultimately Falls Slightly by Two Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market was quite peaceful yesterday. The overall trend fluctuated within a limited range in the first half of the day. Although it rebounded due to strong demand for oil settlements, recent exports of domestic sesame and tung oil have kept bank selling healthy, making it difficult for the exchange rate to tighten. Ultimately, it closed with a slight decrease. In the morning, the overseas silver market showed no change in both the UK and the US. The forward silver price in Montreal was unchanged or down by up to five hao. The exchange rate rose, and the London spot gold price rose by one penny. The Central Bank's posted rates showed no change in both the UK and the US, and the customs gold unit was unchanged, with the standard gold price posted at 1147.3 yuan, which slightly stabilized sentiment. Off-market pre-market trading opened higher at around 46 yuan. After opening, it rose and fell erratically, and the situation was uncertain. Later, the settlement demand from oil companies such as Mobil and Asiatic was still strong, and the exchange rate weakened, gradually pulling it up. The HSBC posted rates showed no change in both the UK and the US. The market was still in a mid-day consolidation, but Zhejiang also came to settle, and the flying price was quite stable. Banks took advantage of the high price to sell, and there were many sources of supply after the rise, making it difficult to rise further. However, the pullback was also slight, because the Hong Kong market was repeatedly tight. It is said that the banks were desperately buying, lacking sellers. At this time, the gold market was still stable, hovering between 46 and 47 yuan, lacking change. Later, large accounts turned more bearish, and the China South Bank vigorously sold spot US dollars, causing the market to collapse and gradually move downstream, falling to 44.1 yuan. The forecast for Indian silver to rise by two annas lacked impact, and the market returned to consolidation at noon. The outflow of funds from the industry meant that there was no progress in the market, and the future range-bound situation was difficult to break. The spot premium was about 8 yuan strong yesterday. Currently, the chips are still around 12,000, with the long side exceeding the short side by 13. The midday market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 1145.9 yuan, up nine jiao from the previous close. Hengyu, Fuyu, Chunyuan, Yonglai, and Jin rose to 6.7 jiao.

Chunyuan and Yongjin re-emerged, falling to 6.2 jiao. The HSBC posted rates were expected to show no change in both the UK and the US. At this time, the market was consolidating, Decheng was still selling, falling from 6.8 yuan to 6 yuan. Huixiang, Hengyu, Qingfa, Yonghong, Kangyong, and Shangjin rose to 7 yuan. Although Chunyuan, Yongda, Fengheng sold at 6.4 jiao, Huixiang, Hengchang, and Yongshang bought, rising to 7.2 jiao. Zhejiang settled the US dollar for December at 75. Dafa and Yonghuixiang sold off at high prices, falling to 6.2 jiao. At this time, the Hong Kong market was repeatedly tight. According to Reuters, this was because the banks were settling and there were few sellers, so the market was still stable. Later, Chunyuan, Yonghuixiang, Yifeng, Yongyu, Xinxian, and Hengyu sold off, falling to 4.7 jiao. Yongli, Jinjiang, Fuyu, Tongtaichang bought at low prices, rising to 5.6 jiao. China South Bank vigorously sold spot US dollars at 8125, and Decheng and Hengyu vigorously sold, falling to 4.1 jiao. The forecast for Indian silver to rise by two annas had no impact.

Then 42 more at 8 yuan 1 jiao were issued by Dingtai to Yicheng before moving to the more stable ground that Yinfenheng and Hengyu had issued at. Spot premiums are now less relevant to pricing as the cost of funds has stabilized.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were normal. In total, Chunyuan, Yongfengchang, Shenfeng, Yuanmao, Yonghuixiang, Fuxingyong, Qingfayong, etc. were on the buying side, and Decheng, Yicheng, Shunmao, Richang, Fuyu, Yifengyong, Wanfengding, Kang, etc. were on the selling side.

Zhejiang Mobil continued to settle, and the situation was relatively soft. The silver balance tax was announced to be unchanged. The process was hovering, but because the banks were still selling, and China South Bank vigorously selling spot US dollars, it gradually eased back.

<h3>Bulls Halt Rally in Securities Market, Bond Market Feels Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, market sentiment turned weak. The He clan liquidated their positions, initially believing there might be a turning point in the North China situation. However, the bullish rally suddenly stopped, and the market atmosphere immediately darkened. Market prices could not rally, with bullish barriers too high and the environment constantly striking blows, leading to the pain of being caught between advancing and retreating. The changes in the future are just beginning. Yesterday's trading saw buying of the 4th, 16th, and 48th bonds at the opening, and selling of the 5th, 33rd, 69th, and 78th bonds. Initially, the rally was strong, with administrative reduction bonds rising 6.5 jiao, troop reduction bonds rising 7.9 jiao, and the 19th Customs, Good Deeds, and 20-volume bonds rising 3 to 4 jiao. From the 20th Customs bond onwards, selling pressure increased, gradually weakening, and becoming more intense later on. Currently, the short-term decrease of 8 jiao was the highest, followed by a general decline of 3 to 4 jiao. Only the salt tax bonds saw a unique rise of 3, 5, or 6 jiao. In the afternoon session, the news was unfavorable, and trading was light, with supply far exceeding demand. The 3rd, 69th, and 78th bonds were sold, but acceptance was scarce, and market prices uniformly declined, from 1 to 2 jiao to 6 to 7 jiao, showing a weak situation. The future remains pessimistic. The daily market price results, except for administrative reduction and troop reduction bonds rising 5 fen to 2.5 jiao, showed a uniform decline, slightly from 4 to 5 jiao to 1 yuan. The total trading volume was 22,246,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Prices Soar</h3>
<p>A report from Sin Fung Foreign Firm stated that yesterday (the 3rd), the New York stock market surged. The Dow Jones Railroad Stock Index reached a new high since 1935, as the prospects for railway freight improved. Investors had a strong need for high-quality stocks, and prices soared. Stocks on the small exchange rose slightly, and the bond market was quite strong. The total daily trading volume was 1.93 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Financial Circles Repeatedly Absorb, Yarn and Cotton Prices Surge</h3>
<p>Forward Yarn Breaks the 210 Yuan Mark, Cotton Rises to Over 46 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market surged, and the situation continued to advance, due to the development of actual demand, the Sichuan merchants gradually becoming active, and the inland merchants purchasing smoothly. The central thinking of the peers also felt a shift. The financial circles' bullish view on bidding yarn reached its peak. The Jinzi gang also came to buy wildly, causing the chips in the market to dry up, and the market surged wildly. New highs for forward months appeared one after another.</p>
<p>Rubber Yarn Jumps Three to Four Yuan</p>
<p>Bidding yarn opened higher across all months in the forward market. The situation is tight, and the price surge is sharp. Due to good news on American cotton, and the Jinzi gang coming to buy again, the market feels particularly lacking. The amount pulled in by the financial circles has not been released. General floating shorts, seeing the unfavorable environment, had to reluctantly cut their losses. As a result, buying was strong, and market prices advanced steadily. However, Changfeng turned from bullish to bearish, and the selling volume was quite sufficient. General outsiders swept and absorbed, resulting in each month rising from 1.9 jiao to 1.6 jiao. The market remained strong at the opening in the afternoon, with Yuan Yi and Yongchang purchasing in large quantities, and the market situation remained serious. However, Changfeng frequently moved to sell, and the amount was huge, reaching 5,000 bales, but it was still difficult to curb the buying trend. As a result, each month rose from 1.1 jiao to 1.8 or 9 jiao compared to the morning closing price. The high for forward months has reached 213.5 yuan. According to the investigation, Dafu sold 900 bales, Yudai 450 bales, Senkang 450 bales, Taichang 2,050 bales, Yichang 1,800 bales, Changfeng 5,000 bales, Xincheng 1,750 bales, Changji 400 bales, Yuanda 550 bales, Hengde 550 bales, and Runkang 750 bales. Buyers: Tongfu 1,050 bales, Hengyi 500 bales, Dafeng 1,600 bales, Mingde 110 bales, Zhenda 500 bales, Renfeng 1,200 bales, Yuan Yi 1,400 bales, Gengfeng 600 bales, and Yongchang 2,000 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Bidding Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Compared to Previous Day Inventory</p>
<p>December 203.0 200.0 202.0 Foreign 5.10 29,750</p>
<p>January 204.3 202.5 204.3 3.0 58,750</p>
<p>March 210.0 208.1 210.0 58.0 59,800</p>
<p>April 211.5 209.5 211.5 4.10 62,550</p>
<p>May 213.3 212.1 215.4 4.50 7,800</p>
<p>Total 253,800</p>
<p>Yarn Sales are Remarkably Strong, Thread Prices Rise Sharply</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are becoming more active. According to statistics, various guilds bought a total of 1,860 bales throughout the day. Prices rose by 2 yuan, and thread prices rose by 5 yuan. The buying amounts for each dealer are listed below:</p>
<p>April 325 Nanjing 15 Nanyang 40</p>
<p>Inland 815 Peers 655 Guangdong 10</p>
<p>Ningbo 5 Hankou 10</p>
<p>The rise in the cotton market is extreme. Because of good news on American cotton, foreign firms are absorbing and hoarding heavily, and the calculated price of foreign cotton is too far apart. As a result, speculators are pulling up strongly, and the number of deliveries from various sources is gradually decreasing. Chips are particularly lacking, and the Jinzi gang is also coming to buy wildly, so market prices are surging straight ahead.</p>
<p>Bidding Cotton Rises Sharply by One and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>Bidding cotton rose across all months in the forward market. Market prices are extremely serious. Buyers in the market are like swarms of bees coming. The market is moving higher and higher. General floating shorts are once again showing a frightened appearance. Fortunately, Changhe sold in large quantities as prices rose, but it was still difficult to suppress the buying trend. As a result, each month rose from 8 or 9 jiao to 1.5 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market remained strong at the opening in the afternoon, because the Jinzi gang came to buy again, and foreign firms were holding tight in the near months, resulting in extremely depleted chips in the market. Yuan Yi, Dachangcheng, and Mingde purchased wildly in unison, but the shorts Shenchang and Changhe also threw out additional amounts. In fact, there was absorption by new speculators. As a result, each month rose again by 3, 5, or 6 jiao compared to the morning closing price. The new high for forward months has reached 46.3 yuan. According to the investigation, Meiji sold 1,600 dans, Dafu 3,400 dans, Tongji 2,000 dans, Minghua 2,900 dans, Shenji 1,000 dans, Taichang 5,300 dans, Yichang 7,900 dans, Xincheng 1,800 dans, Changhe 10,900 dans, Yuanda 1,700 dans, Hexing 1,800 dans, Shenchang 2,400 dans, and Yikang 1,100 dans. Buyers: Dafeng 3,1200 dans, Gengfeng 5,000 dans, Tongfeng 2,900 dans, Yuan Yi 9,700 dans, Changfeng 1,800 dans, Runkang 3,700 dans, Yikang 1,700 dans, Yuanxingchang 4,300 dans, Mingde 4,700 dans, Dachangcheng 3,200 dans, Yongchang 3,100 dans, and Tonghe 1,600 dans, Xiecheng 1,200 dans. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Bidding Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory</p>
<p>December 42.85 42.10 42.85 Up 1.0 113,500</p>
<p>January 43.65 42.95 43.65 1.40 106,500</p>
<p>February 44.80 44.15 44.80 1.55 119,900</p>
<p>March 45.50 44.70 45.50 1.70 131,600</p>
<p>April 45.95 45.10 45.95 1.55 137,000</p>
<p>May 46.30 45.60 46.30 1.30 16,700</p>
<p>Total 635,000</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Prices High, Transactions Few</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales: due to the wild jump in forward cotton, holders of goods are very tight-lipped, so it is difficult for both sides to approach each other, and transactions are decreasing. However, Japanese merchants are still purchasing. Prices have risen by 1 yuan compared to yesterday. The source: Yao cotton 620 bales, Tong cotton 800 bales.</p>
<p>Flexible-Sale Cotton 64.00 Domestic and foreign factories take in 82 pieces for spot delivery to factories</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 45.50 Dongmian firm takes in 3,000 bales, for immediate packing and delivery</p>

<h3>Distant American Cotton Prices Rise the Most</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with a constructive interpretation of next year's cotton program, and favorable Liverpool news. Traders, foreign firms, Wall Street, and shorts all bought, especially in the distant months. Prices rose 14-25 points across all months. Subsequently, as production households sold January contracts and longs liquidated, cotton farmers' hedging led to slight weakness, but the amount sold was immediately absorbed. Market conditions were mixed in the afternoon. Traders sold nearby months and bought distant months. At the same time, buyers hesitated due to concerns that an unfavorable ruling from the High Court would affect the cotton field program. The closing was firm. Spot prices rose 15 points, futures rose 12-33 points, British spot cotton rose 9 points, futures rose 10-11 points, Indian cotton European exporters and longs liquidated, and small investors mostly bought. Phalguni rose half a rupee, Oomra rose 0.25-0.5 rupee, and Broach fell 0.25 rupee. Original telegrams are on the left (telegram dated the 3rd):</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Broach cotton on the 4th was 225.5 rupees, up 2.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grain Wheat Prices Plunge Over One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market: trading was very quiet at the opening in the morning. Later, due to rumors of cotton and wheat loans and the loosening of the flour market, the market atmosphere became slightly smoother. The prices for January, February, and March fell by 5-7 fen. At the opening in the afternoon, trading was more active, but prices still fell. Some longs, fearing that the rumors would become reality, believed that the future situation would be unthinkable. Recalling the disastrous fall two years ago, they were unwilling to resist again, so they sold a lot, and prices fell another 3-5 fen. On average, the drop was over one jiao, and January alone fell a huge 1.4 jiao. In view of this situation, it can be seen that the sharp rise in recent months was deeply influenced by people's emotions. The actual supply and demand cannot be used as a definitive conclusion. Spot wheat prices have also fallen drastically due to futures and flour prices declining.</p>

<h3>Flour Market Plunge Erupts</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: trading was still visible at the opening in the morning, then gradually and sharply fell. Because the quote for foreign wheat was slightly better in Chicago by 4 fen, and better in Canada by 1 or 2 jiao, the initial prices remained stable. But after that, there was a sharp fall, because the expansion of cotton loans, although not recognized by the US government, was nonetheless sudden. As for the foreign firms, the asking price for spot wheat was still 6 jiao, but if you wanted to settle, you could compromise, so the big players and longs released their positions, and the fall was very sharp, falling 3-5 from the previous day's closing price. At the opening in the afternoon, things were initially flat, then shorts covered their positions. As this news had not yet become a reality, the market temporarily stabilized.</p>

<h3>Tianjin-Area Rice Continues to be Handled</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from all guilds arrived, totaling over 40 suppliers (goods totaling over 8,000 dan), most of which was thin-grain rice. The sales market for thin-grain rice was very active, and almost all the goods on the market were purchased, totaling over 3,000 bags, so the market conditions for thin-grain rice rose by 5-6 fen.

<h3>Jiangxi Rice Has Hoarders Buying</h3>
<p>Although there were many customer fragrant rice arrivals yesterday, the market was lively because the appetite on this street increased, and hoarders inquired from a certain source, the situation turned lively. All grades of high and medium rice turned lively. Jiangxi rice was raised by several fen because hoarders were present. If the local merchants and hoarders' appetite continues to grow, then prices are still expected to become lively. However, the appetite of the Northern ocean guilds has been flat recently. Apart from handling loaded He Xia rice, customer fragrant rice has lacked smooth sales for a long time. A total of 6,500 bags of Jiangxi rice, 785 bags of Hunan rice, 770 bags of Shahan rice, 640 bags of Fujian rice, over 2,000 bags of Zhejiang rice, and 6,000 bags of Jiangxi aircraft rice were opened throughout the day. Apart from being purchased by hoarders, they were all bought by local merchants.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods Black Dates Open Higher by Half a Yuan</h3>

<h3>Sugar Market Refined Red Sugar Prices Rise by 5-6 Jiao</h3>

Guangdong coarse white spot was 21.7 yuan, and re-exported Dutch coarse white was 6.75 yuan, with a small amount of extra .05 yuan, all of which had been marked. The local factory's refined white Zhenji No. 1 was 20.8 yuan. The standard prices for various sugars marked by the Sugar Industry Cooperative Company remained unchanged, with only 100 bags of coarse white sand Wuyang traded, and there was a lack of buyers. A few dozen bags of new Chaoqing were opened by the Chao gang, priced at 10 yuan. According to the investigation, there are only a little over a thousand bags remaining in storage, and the production price is hard to write. People's hearts have turned firm. Refined red sugar goods have already opened, and according to the production telegram, they have already risen by 5-6 jiao. Good goods marked in Shanghai must be outside 13 yuan. The future market looks higher. Dongchi small grades of 2 jiao were 17 yuan, followed by 16.8 yuan, and East White grades 8-9 were unchanged, and there were also a lack of transactions.</p>

<h3>Nanyang Inspection Group of the National Goods Circle</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Nanyang is an area where overseas Chinese gather. The vast land, the large population, and the deep wealth are all very long-standing. In addition, the patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese and the psychology of favoring national goods are indeed the best market for national goods sold abroad. This publication has contributed this idea to the national goods circle more than once over the years, and those who are enthusiastic about national goods among overseas Chinese have also tried their best to promote it. Consul General Song Faxiang of the Dutch East Indies is one of the most enthusiastic people. He spares no effort in advising and guiding. He has discussed and discussed perfect methods several times at the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association. Recently, he attended the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association and reported on the progress of promoting national goods in the South, and came to Shanghai to solicit products from various factories to participate in the Nanyang National Goods Touring Exhibition, which will open in April next year, in order to expand and develop trade in Nanyang. At the same time, based on the achievements of the Singapore National Goods Exhibition, local overseas Chinese all said that the motherland's industry has made such progress and the products are so sophisticated that everyone expressed their welcome. All the products shipped by various factories were sold out, and there was still a shortage of supply. Therefore, the national goods people who attended listened to Mr. Song's report and unanimously believed that the publicity and contact with Nanyang by various factories should be carried out vigorously at present, because there is an organized action of the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group. This is a fundamental policy to seek a way out for national goods in response to the needs of the times. The reporter very much hopes that under the guidance of the International Trade Bureau and Consul General Song, it will be completed as soon as possible and go together. As far as the reporter can see, the tasks of this group and this trip should include the following seven points.</p>
<p>(1) Describe the latest situation of the national goods circles in the motherland, and the manufacturing situation of various factories. It is best to bring the industrial films taken by various factories to be screened. The true knowledge and insight are especially impressive.</p>
<p>(2) Investigate the living conditions of overseas Chinese in Nanyang and the items they usually use, and study their psychology and preferences, so that when making products, we can cater to their preferences and suit their application.</p>
<p>(3) Investigate the trends of the Nanyang market and the degree of purchasing power of the general society, so as to determine the steps and policies of trade.</p>
<p>(4) Investigate the currency and exchange situation in Nanyang to determine the standard of prices.</p>
<p>(5) Investigate the transportation procedures in Nanyang and the collection standards of tax regulations, so that the shipment and delivery of goods have a certain calculation, so as not to lose the trust of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(6) Contact Nanyang vendors and agree with them on the method of distributing national goods.</p>
<p>(7) Establish a Nanyang National Goods Introduction Office to facilitate the consultation and procurement of overseas Chinese, and to be responsible for domestic and foreign communications at any time.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Communications has responded to the request of overseas Chinese in Nanyang and is actively planning to open Nanyang routes to facilitate the circulation of national goods. This matter is closely related to the development of Nanyang national goods. Although it currently requires a huge amount of 25 million yuan in expenses, with the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese and a high degree of certainty in business, it should be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the China Chemical Industry Society</h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>On the afternoon of November 27th, at 2 o'clock, we took our visitor's passes from the China Chemical Industry Society, and six of us went together to the factory gate on Pinlang Road in Shanghai. We were greeted by a Mr. Fan, who gave us a very detailed explanation, leaving a very good impression.</p>
<p>We first went to the soap-making room. There were several large pots cooking fat. After it was melted, it was put into a mixer where an alkaline solution was added, and it was continuously stirred to alkalize the fat. This is called soap stock. Ordinary laundry soap is made by cooling this soap stock, putting it in a wooden frame, and stamping it with a trademark. When we went, they were making perfumed soap. The method was to cut the soap bars into thin slices, then move them into an oven to dry them. Then, appropriate pigments and fragrances were added, and after it was completely mixed, it was pressed into long strips. Finally, it was stamped with a trademark in a stamping machine.</p>
<p>In the second part, we went to the toothpaste and cold cream production area. The factory was very clean. The raw materials for toothpaste are sodium carbonate Na2Co3, calcium carbonate CaCo, glycerine (glycerine C3H5(OH)3……CH2(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2(OH)). Auxiliary materials commonly used are gum powder, alcohol (CH7CH2OH), boric acid, syrup, etc. The fragrances used are anise oil, peppermint essence, rose essence, etc. The first step is to refine the gum, gradually heating it. After a suitable amount of time, it is moved into a cream-rolling machine to be rolled until it achieves a sticky, toffee-like consistency. The second step is to fill the cans. This work requires three people. The first person pulls a lever to fill the tin cans with toothpaste. The second person takes it, uses a machine to flatten the bottom of the tube, then rolls the bottom edge, and passes it to the third person, who then adds a bottom clip and fastens it with a machine. This is the product that we buy. The movements are very skilled. We watched for quite a while.</p>
<p>The raw materials for cold cream are stearic acid, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, etc. First, they are put into a large pot and heated, while being stirred, until they dissolve into a paste. Then, they are placed in a large lead bucket and stirred manually. At this time, the color and shape are like ordinary paste, not very attractive. Then, when it is half-cooled, fragrance is added, and it is stirred until it is evenly mixed. This is cold cream. The factory's products include "Era Cream," "Fragrant Ze Zhi," and "Three Stars Original Cold Cream," which are very popular on the market.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three types, the factory also produces seasoning powder (the most common on the market are "Wei Sheng" and "Guanyin Powder" (a type)), soy sauce essence, caramel coloring, and mosquito coils, starch, etc. In particular, "Three Stars" mosquito coils are something we come into contact with almost daily in the summer. Their reach has almost extended to small cities and towns across the country, becoming a popular product for the masses. Unfortunately, we did not get to visit all of them, which is a regret.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the China Chemical Industry Society, foreign goods filled the domestic market. Later, the "Three Stars" brand gradually took over. Except for raw materials that China does not have, which have to be purchased from Germany, the rest are made with domestic products. In recent years, business has developed, and there are two distribution centers in Shanghai. Branches have also been opened in Tianjin, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao, and other places. The total annual turnover is about three million yuan.</p>
<p>After the visit, we felt extremely satisfied. Finally, we expressed our deep gratitude to Mr. Fan for his enthusiastic hospitality.</p>

<h3>The Demand for Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>In China after the national crisis, the lack of freedom of speech has simply turned it into a silent China. Not only is genuine public opinion unable to be fully expressed, but also the various situations of internal and external affairs are not dared to be fully reported. As a result, the general public is kept in the dark, waiting for national subjugation!</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is inherently permitted by national law. The reason why the authorities have recently taken a monitoring attitude towards speech must have its own unavoidable difficulties. However, suppressing speech should have clear methods, stipulating a certain scope, allowing people the opportunity to express their views. If speech really goes beyond the bounds, then it should be prohibited, which is naturally permissible. If it is simply suppressed across the board, not allowing even correct commentary or truthful news to be published, then it is an excessive oppression. This not only deprives the people of their freedom of speech, but is also detrimental to the country!</p>
<p>Today's China is facing a critical juncture of life and death. To save the country and seek survival, it is necessary for the whole nation to rise up together and jointly face the national crisis. But to get the people to save the country, they should at least be allowed to understand a little about national affairs and express their opinions on national affairs. This cannot be done without opening up speech. Because speech is a powerful intangible weapon, the government's diplomacy is prone to failure without speech as its backing!</p>
<p>At this Fifth Plenary Session, some members of the Central Committee proposed a motion to open up the press and restore freedom of speech, which is extremely necessary. Recently, the Nanjing Central Daily News also published an article asking the authorities to change the news policy, which shows that freedom of speech has become an urgent demand of the people. The editorial conclusion of the newspaper said: "The situation is so serious today that the preliminary and fundamental remedy we have in mind is for the government to quickly change its news policy. The party headquarters or the government agencies in charge of news should quickly discuss with the press a simple method, clearly stipulating a few strict restrictions. Apart from that, all conspiracies and actions and people who endanger the country, all facts and behaviors that poison politics and destroy the principles, the expressions and actions of the people's patriotic behavior, especially the various criticisms of foreign newspapers and the factual records, should all be allowed to be published in domestic newspapers. If this method can be implemented, we believe that after three months, the situation in our internal affairs and diplomacy will be refreshed. At that time, the government will be able to directly and indirectly obtain unexpected strength to assist it in promoting various political undertakings and renewing the political lineup. This is by no means empty talk, nor is it the view of a scholar. We sincerely pray that the authorities adopt this suggestion immediately and hope that the entire press will work together to realize this ideal to serve the country." These words are very insightful!</p>
<p>We guarantee to the authorities here that the people's struggle for freedom of speech is only with good intentions and no malicious intent. The people's demand for freedom of speech is aimed at saving the country and they absolutely do not want to harm the country. Therefore, we hope that the government can be mindful of the difficulties of the times, listen to the people's opinions, and open up speech, so that the people can get an opportunity to serve the country. We also hope that the entire press will rise up and work hard to achieve the goal of realizing freedom of speech!</p>
<h3>Reading "A New Land Program for China"</h3>
<p>— Zeng Jianping</p>
<p>By Yin Zhenxia, published by Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>Since Yan Xishan announced his land proposal, scholars from all walks of life in the country have suddenly started to discuss this long-idle issue. Obviously, the land issue, no matter when, has always occupied the center of China's governance and chaos for two thousand years, and it is not easily abandoned or avoided.</p>
<p>However, although China's land problem is very important, the general works on this problem in bookstores are very scarce. Because of the scarcity of this type of book published in bookstores, the "Chinese Land System" and "Collection of Studies on Chinese Land," published by Commercial Press, "Research on Chinese Rural Economy," "Research on Chinese Land System," and "Land Tax System of the Two Song Dynasties," published by New Life, and "Ancient Chinese Society" by Liming, and "History of Chinese Land System" by Zhengzhong, etc., have become the main reading materials for young people who generally study China's land problem. At the same time, these readings are mostly about the study of the land system of past dynasties in China, and rarely touch on the issues we are currently arguing about. However, while there is a shortage of these books, fortunately, Mr. Yin Zhenxia's "A New Land Program for China" has been read by the author.</p>
<p>First of all, we must acknowledge that Mr. Yin Zhenxia's work is a book completed with great energy and is a work that clarifies Mr. Sun Yat-sen's fundamental proposition. Because Mr. Chen Lifu said in his preface to it: "The local land program can clarify the way to equal wealth and eliminate the poverty. Reading this, one will be more aware of the greatness of the Principle of People's Livelihood." And Mr. An Ruoding also believes that "After reading it carefully, the book analyzes how to divide the land, how to allocate the population, how to reform the land system, and how to reorganize the land tax... one by one, with practical methods." It can be seen that the book has considerable correctness in its argumentation.</p>
<p>However, although Mr. Yin's work has considerable correctness in principle, the author believes that there are still several points that should be discussed after careful reading. For example:</p>
<p>First: In the second section of the fourth chapter of the book, "The Well-Field System," the author quotes Du You's Tongdian, which says: "In the past, the Yellow Emperor began to manage the land and set up wells to stop disputes, and established steps and acres to prevent shortages, making people's homes into wells, and wells opening four roads... and the system was not changed until Xia and Yin," then unquestioningly asserts: "This is the well-field system of the Yellow Emperor's era. The Yellow Emperor's well-field system adopted large-scale agricultural management, with eight families jointly producing and jointly distributing..." At the same time, he further cites Mencius's saying that "eight families all privately owned 100 acres" and the saying in the Book of Songs that "the rain wets our public fields, and then our private fields," thus concluding that the land system of the Zhou Dynasty changed dramatically from the "public ownership and public management" of the Yellow Emperor to the "public ownership and public management" of the early Zhou Dynasty until the Spring and Autumn Period. We dare not agree with this affirmative attitude.</p>
<p>Because Du You's Tongdian's records about the field system of the Yellow Emperor's era can be said to be completely forged by associating with Mencius's opinions. The unreliability of this material has long been determined by knowledgeable people, and the so-called Yellow Emperor's era was historically the early clan society of China. The common possession of land by clan societies is the first form of private land ownership. Under this form of land ownership, even if the rural commune form is adopted to manage the land at that time, there can never be a system of "eight families" jointly producing and jointly distributing. However, Mr. Yin, in this book, unquestioningly gives an affirmative judgment, which we dare not agree with.</p>
<p>Second: From the Zhou Dynasty to the Spring and Autumn Period, we cannot recognize that the land system at that time was unconditionally "public ownership and private management." Because from the early Zhou Dynasty to the Spring and Autumn Period, Chinese society had gradually moved from a tribal society to a feudal society. The country formed by the feudal landlord aristocracy holding land is the second form of private land ownership. Since the rulers at that time were constantly fighting for land and constantly granting land to their subordinates, how can we determine the existence of the land communal system before the Spring and Autumn Period! Therefore, we cannot agree with Mr. Yin's citation of ancient Chinese field systems, which does not adopt newer theories and research, but only believes in ancient people and ancient books and draws conclusions hastily.</p>
<p>Third: The author made a mistake in the seventh section of the fourth chapter of the book, "Equal Field System." He cited the statement that "men are granted 40 acres of land, called 'double field,' and women are granted 20 acres of land, called 'exposed field.'" This point is inconsistent with the facts. Because the equal field order of the Yuanwei Year 9 clearly stated: "All men over the age of fifteen are granted 40 acres of exposed fields; women are granted 20 acres... The fields granted are generally doubled; fields with three rotations are doubled again to supply cultivation and the increase and decrease in grants." (See Wei Shu Shi Huo Zhi) It can be seen that the 40 acres received by a man at that time were exposed fields, not double fields. The so-called double fields were additional fields outside the mulberry fields and exposed fields at that time. It was increased or decreased according to the quality of the land. Now the author regards the 40 acres received by each man as double fields, which is obviously inconsistent with the facts at that time. This is what the author dares to ask the author to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Fourth: The author also repeats the above-mentioned mistakes in the "Conclusion" of the fifteenth section of the fourth chapter of the book. He said: "Summing up the land systems of the past dynasties mentioned above, generally speaking, they can be divided into five periods: (1) the period of public land ownership and public management, before the three dynasties; (2) the period of public land ownership and private management, from the three dynasties to the end of the Zhou Dynasty; (3) the period of private land ownership, from the Warring States period to the Northern and Southern Dynasties; (4) the period of national land ownership revival, from Emperor Xiaowen of the Later Wei Dynasty to the middle of the Tang Dynasty..." (See page 46 of the book) In my opinion, this conclusion is also not very appropriate. Because the so-called national land ownership is originally the second form of the private land ownership system. The so-called national land ownership from Yuan Wei to Tang is actually the private ownership of the feudal landlord aristocracy at that time, which is completely different from the content of modern so-called national land ownership. The vast land occupied by the nobles and powerful people of the past dynasties at that time, the existence of the manor system of the noble landlords, and the emperor's constant granting of large amounts of land to powerful ministers, all prove that there could not have been any national land ownership system in China from Yuan Wei to Tang, let alone a revival period of national land ownership. In this book, the author opposes this kind of "national land ownership" to "private land ownership," which is obviously a bit incorrect in methodology.</p>
<p>Fifth: At the same time, the author also made a small mistake in the sixth chapter of the second part. That is, after the author cited various statistics to prove the reduction of arable land in the provinces of mainland China, he concluded that "the drastic reduction of farmland and farm households in the five provinces of Yu, E, Xiang, Gan, and Yue is probably affected by A natural disasters, B bandits, C poor governance, and D the decline of the rural economy, resulting in farmers' inability to maintain themselves and escape death, so they abandon their cultivated morning land." (See page 8). Undoubtedly, this conclusion lightly glosses over the fact that the imperialists' aggression against China has deepened China's natural and man-made disasters and created China's political instability, which is the main factor. If it were as the author said, it would easily lead readers to regard the above-mentioned reasons as spontaneous phenomena in China, unrelated to imperialism. Then, wouldn't it be letting go of a major culprit?</p>
<p>Regarding this point, the author hopes that Mr. Yin can correct it in his second edition.</p>
<p>In short, the second part of the book "A New Land Program for China" is better than the first part. Because the first part focuses more on theory, and the second part focuses more on practice. In the sixth chapter and beyond, especially in the reform of rural arable land, the author has given us many practical methods. Therefore, when the problem of China's land system has been forced from theory to practice, this book is still worth reading.</p>
<h3>Reading the First Volume of China Post</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Xinzai</p>
<p>Written by Zhang Biao Ren, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>The current Chinese revolution has progressed from the process of shouting to the process of practical work, and the work of destruction needs to be replaced by the work of construction. Needless to say, China is praised by all countries in the world for the various practical achievements created through hard work in recent years: just to say that to make China advance into a modern new country, it is urgent to organize and implement various new undertakings. In the past 100 years, the most concrete manifestation of the Chinese revolution has actually been in the field of transportation, and among the transportation undertakings, the most outstanding achievement is the postal service. Speaking of the postal service, it is as common as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and maintains a close relationship with people's daily life. Who doesn't know that the postal service is an institution for delivering letters, who doesn't have a direct connection with the postal service, and who doesn't know that the postal service is the best new undertaking run by China. But further ask where the postal service's performance is good? More concerned people will know that the reason why the postal service is praised by China and foreign countries is that its organization is complete and strict, and it can be the most unified administrative organ in the country; the examination of personnel is precise and prudent, and it can be called the most suitable for the spirit of the European and American civil service system: the handling of affairs is quick and reliable, and it is full of a sense of responsibility, which can be called a model for talking about administrative efficiency: and the postal service can really enable the people to obtain the greatest enjoyment with the lowest sacrifice, which can be said to be a new undertaking that is most in line with welfareism. These words are certainly correct, but if you ask further why the Chinese postal service can create such achievements and reputation? I am afraid that no one knows what to say, but how can the outstanding achievements of the postal service be accidental?</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese government and the public have known to work hard on the transportation industry, but the substantial advancement of the transportation industry must first make the people have a full knowledge of the transportation industry, so that they can know the way to use it and fulfill the responsibility of loving it. For example, the postal service: in terms of history, the trial has been carried out for more than 60 years, in terms of scope, from large cities to remote and dilapidated areas, covering the whole country: in terms of its relationship with the people, it is the most universal, the most close and important. However, there has been no special work that systematically describes this, so that the people can have a true understanding of it, and understand why the postal service is doing well, that is, the implementation of other new undertakings can also get a good mirror for this, which is really a major regret in the creation of a new country and new undertakings. But now, this regret has been made up for by the publication of Zhang's China Post.</p>
<p>The whole book of China Post has about 500,000 words, divided into three volumes: upper, middle, and lower. The upper volume has been published recently, divided into four parts and 17 chapters, focusing on the administrative department of China Post. After reading it, this book traces the past evolution of the postal service in detail and clearly; the current organization, the vertical subordination, the horizontal connection, and its procurement, operational powers, tasks, all have precise and profound observations, not only superficial analysis and introduction. As for the appointment, salary, performance evaluation, shifts, rewards and punishments, duties, retirement, etc. of personnel, they are described in detail, dissected in depth, and measured with the academic principles of personnel administration to weigh their gains and losses; the final chapter discusses the organization and function of postal personnel groups as its final. Various laws, regulations, and anything related to the postal service are fully equipped. After reading such a great work about the Chinese postal service, I cannot help but think of the considerable energy spent by the author. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Liangren, the author of this book, is a PhD in economics from Germany. He has served in transportation and postal administrative agencies for many years after returning to China, and has personally participated in the revision of postal laws and regulations. Naturally, such a specialized work must be written by an author with rich knowledge and experience, in order to take care of both academic theory and facts, integrate and connect them, and avoid the drawbacks of being superficial or dry and shallow.</p>
<p>After reading this book, I had three feelings: First, there is no reason for anything to be lucky. The excellent performance of China's postal service has its own reasons for being excellent. This reason lies in the postal administrative organization, the dynamic and static mechanisms are strict and reasonable, and can operate flexibly within the track. In terms of personnel, the selection, use, and treatment of personnel can enable everyone to make the best use of their talents and devote themselves to the development of public affairs with peace of mind. Second, the achievements of the postal service can be extrapolated to other undertakings, and even to government agencies. If you want to make the operation of the undertaking economical and reasonable, increase efficiency, be responsible, and reduce waste, you must pay attention to the administrative organization mechanism and the appointment and treatment of personnel. Therefore, this book is not only the only systematic classic in the administrative aspect of the Chinese postal service, but also for those who seek to improve management, make operations economical and reasonable, and develop undertakings, as well as those who are concerned about the improvement of administrative agency organization and personnel administration, China Post is the most valuable practical example. Third, I feel that China's publishing industry has great hope for progress, and can gradually move towards more specialized and in-depth research, and no longer limit itself to general introductions to sociology and general discussions of political science, textbook books. From this, I further hope that the publishing industry will have more systematic writings of a more specialized nature that involve all aspects of the new undertakings of this country, which will be of infinite help to the creation of a new China.</p>
<p>The above are just the words I thought of saying after browsing the first volume of China Post. The middle volume focuses on postal business, and the lower volume focuses on postal economics. I hope very much that they can be published as soon as possible to complete the entire canon of the Chinese postal service.</p>
<h3>Bookstore Miscellany (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>(7) Proofreaders</p>
<p>In the editorship of a new bookstore, the reason we mention proofreaders immediately after the editor-in-chief, without mentioning other personnel, is because proofreading is a task that is relatively unnoticed, but in fact, it is quite interesting and important. People in the book industry certainly know what proofreading is all about, but people outside the industry may not know much. So, I must first tell you that proofreading, simply put, is the process of correcting the unedited proofs sent by the printing house, which have been typeset but not yet printed, according to the original manuscript. Isn't this work very simple? As a result, in the early stages of the new book industry, there were just too many interesting things happening in bookstores due to proofreading.</p>
<p>"Proofreading" can be said to be an even more difficult task than "clipping newspapers". Isn't clipping newspapers very easy, what's so difficult about it? But according to the reports of people who have experience with clipping newspapers, no one succeeds at first. For example, first, you must know how to choose and discard materials, and second, you must know how to classify materials. If this kind of work is done by someone without experience, even if you tell him which section of the news to clip, he may only clip the first section and forget the second half published on another page or in another line. Although the situation of proofreading is different, its difficulty is actually the same in principle.</p>
<p>Bookstore owners without experience (or general managers, editors-in-chief, in short, those in charge) think that proofreading is easy, so at first, most of them are unwilling to pay higher wages to hire proofreaders. Some even assign apprentices to do it, resulting in countless errors in new books. Some writers are dissatisfied with other people's proofreading and think that proofreading is easy, so they often ask the bookstore to proofread the manuscripts themselves, but the result is even worse than what the apprentices in the bookstore proofread. Proofreading seems to be somewhat mysterious. People with insufficient academic ability and poor writing skills think that proofreading only requires comparing word by word, so naturally, they will make unimaginable mistakes. On the other hand, even if the original author does the proofreading, he may feel very satisfied when he is proofreading, but after the book is published, there will be mistakes that even he cannot believe. Some even think that the printing house made the mistakes.</p>

<h3>The American Airplane "China Clipper" Successfully Crosses the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a noteworthy event in the Pacific Ocean: the successful crossing of the Pacific by the American airplane "China Clipper." This plane has four engines, each with 800 horsepower, and a carrying capacity of 51,000 pounds. It took off from Alameda on the west coast of the United States, passed through Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam, and flew to Manila, Philippines. The entire journey of 8,000 miles took only five days, which can be said to be the first great feat since the advent of transportation in the Pacific. Therefore, the American people have been greatly encouraged and delighted by this event, and countries around the world have also paid great attention to it.</p>
<p>In terms of the benefits of science to mankind, this event is very worthy of praise. The development and utilization of science by mankind is originally aimed at increasing human happiness. Like this time, the "China Clipper" crossed the Pacific Ocean, greatly shortening the originally vast transportation in the Pacific and rapidly promoting the close relationship between the world's people. This is of great benefit to the happiness of the people. Not only is this event so, but in other aspects, such as the use of explosives to open up mines and steep mountain roads, and the use of poison gas for sterilization and other medical and agricultural applications, even the things that people consider the most dangerous are beneficial to mankind as long as the purpose of their use is correct. As for the benefits of airplanes and radios to mankind, it goes without saying. Now, however, they have been innocently used by a small number of selfish people. As a result, everything that was originally beneficial to people has become a poisonous substance harmful to mankind. For example, airplanes are used to drop bombs, explosives and poison gas are used as weapons for large-scale killing, ships can be converted into warships, and radio can be used for military purposes. Marconi, the founding father of radio, has even followed Mussolini to Africa to be his assistant in killing people. These many events show how modern science is being used by some selfish people to harm people. As for the American airplane "China Clipper" crossing the Pacific this time, we have no way of guessing whether the US government's motive is to promote Pacific transportation, but in the midst of preparing for another naval conference, Japan has honestly issued a dissatisfied protest regarding this matter. In the air route of the "China Clipper," we can smell a very strong smell of gunpowder.</p>
<p>Only by standing on the "victim's position and uniting to resist the few selfish people, and taking back all the scientific weapons that are beneficial to mankind from their exclusive poisonous hands, can the people use all science to re-create blessings for the people. And the Chinese people bear the greatest responsibility in this mission. Originally, the Chinese people are now the group of people in the world who are most deeply "victimized." The American large airplane crossing the Pacific Ocean wants to be named "China Clipper," precisely implying this serious meaning.</p>
<h3>Memories of the South</h3>
<p>— Huang</p>
<p>Every morning, when the autumn wind full of coldness blows into the small building, it often brings a burst of tragic trumpet sounds, occasionally mixed with the sound of hooves and the rustling of orderly footsteps. At this time, my heart also sinks along with it.</p>
<p>"Another person's life is about to end!" I think like this when I hear this ominous sound. Sometimes, I unconsciously walk closer to the front of the building, lean on the railing and look down. Below, there is an orderly line—a flag bearer walks in front, followed by a dozen infantrymen. The snow-white bayonets on their gun barrels shine in the morning sun. Next are the people waiting for execution. Some are sitting in rickshaws, some are sitting in bamboo baskets carried by one or two people, but some are walking on their own. The last in the line is the supervising officer, riding on a small horse.</p>
<p>Some passers-by occasionally stop to watch, but most turn their faces away, unwilling to take a look at these people who only have a few minutes or ten minutes left in this world.</p>
<p>A few years ago, behind such a line, there were often crowds of onlookers, shouting non-stop: "Go watch the shooting! Go watch the shooting!" But now, this scene is rarely seen. Is it out of habit? Or for some other reason? I don't know. However, since the beginning of autumn, during the winter defense season, the sound of trumpets often blows to this small building with the morning breeze.</p>
<p>I am afraid to see those pale faces, I am afraid to see their trembling before death, and I am even more afraid to see those desolate eyes! It is their last glimpse projected towards the world!</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>I am even more afraid to see the people chasing after them and wailing—their parents, brothers, wives, relatives, or friends. The desolate cries of that kind of death separation are heartbreaking to hear.</p>
<p>"May they..." I often want to bless these dead, and if there is a God, I want to pray for them on their behalf, because he is always our compatriot! But I often only recite the three words "May they...", and I can't say the following requests, because they are called bandits and robbers!</p>
<h3>Silver Chain</h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>Every time I return home, my six-year-old child always pouts and asks: "Dad, what did you bring for me to eat?"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this charming voice, my heart, which has been running around for years, aches. I think: Why don't I have anything for him to eat? — Previously, when I had a job, I often bought biscuits, chocolates, and almond candies for my children to satisfy their appetites. But now? I am poor, I am unemployed; not only can they not eat those sweet biscuits, but they can't even eat their fill for three meals a day!</p>
<p>The three-year-old girl often cries because of hunger. And the six-year-old child often looks at me with a strange expression.</p>
<p>One day, I was silently writing a self-recommendation letter to find a job when the six-year-old child came back with his schoolbag.</p>
<p>"Dad, I'm back," he said to me happily.</p>
<p>"Did you recite your books today?" I asked him casually.</p>
<p>He smiled, nodded, and jumped to his mother.</p>
<p>I continued to write my letter. Suddenly, he came back again. He showed me a face without a smile:</p>
<p>"Why haven't you bought us anything to eat these many days, Dad?"</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly, and I almost shed tears from my bitter smile. I had nothing to answer him, I just smiled bitterly at him, smiled bitterly...</p>
<p>My wife took two biscuits and came in holding the three-year-old girl. She asked if I was hungry. She handed the girl to me and said to me softly:</p>
<p>"Today, I found a gold chain in the drawer of the cabinet!"</p>
<p>"Um, that's silver! That was given to me by my father!... I hesitated. I didn't know what to do with the silver chain that my father gave me.</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm hungry, let me eat those two biscuits!"</p>
<p>So my wife gave the two biscuits to the child who had just returned from school. However, the child leaning in my arms suddenly cried. She shouted:</p>
<p>"I want to eat too... Mom..."</p>
<p>When I heard this hunger turmoil, I raised my head from my hesitation and said to my wife with grief:</p>
<p>"Let me take that silver chain to exchange for money. Anyway, poor people don't have the blessing of keeping souvenirs."</p>
<p>I immediately walked to the cabinet and took out the gold-plated silver chain from the drawer. I thought to myself:</p>
<p>"It can only sustain us for two days at most!"</p>
<h3>Foothills of Ma'anshan</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Suffocating in the heavy carbon dioxide life of the city, one only needs to occasionally smell some grass and soil, and one will feel as relaxed as if drinking soda water. What's more, in the natural scenery of early winter fields with green pine trees, a bay of clear water, and red leaves scattered all over the mountains! The irregular pattern of yellow pebbles and blue broken bricks paved the small path, the intricate pumpkin vines crawled out of the fence, and the wind-fearing vermilion old pumpkins lay under the large leaves, instilling a kind of fulfilling and joyful feeling into the traveler's emotions.</p>
<p>We waved the mountain firewood sticks in our hands, singing beautiful, relaxed, and light-hearted pastoral songs, and walked through the low firewood gate. Behind us, there were countless strange gazes following, following, until we brought the singing over the crescent-shaped ancient stone bridge. Then, from the yellow, dry lips, the astringent words "Shanghai guests!" were uttered, and then, they went back into the low, dilapidated tile house.</p>
<p>Thin white clouds moved slowly on the treetops of the ginkgo trees. The steps of the frustrated are filled with melancholy. Even the white clouds feel bored? People think that you are in the vast and boundless blue sky, and you can freely finish your journey... but you, but you would rather immerse yourself in the cold water flow, letting a few ignorant village children squat on the bank and throw sharp-cornered broken tiles at the water, and even have your cold, quiet face scratched by a group of duck's claws. One piece scatters, and another piece slowly comes over.</p>
<p>Very few can pass over the mountains without changing their shape as a whole. Similarly, in the journey of life, very few can walk to the end without being hindered by the great winds of life, right? Haha, how many travel companions, how many happy unions, have broken up so distressingly before reaching the middle of the journey, broken up. White clouds in the sky above Ma'anshan, the white-haired reeds of old age are also shaking their heads and sighing at you.</p>
<p>The red leaves all over the mountains are blinking their golden eyes and brown eyes in the warm afternoon sun, showing a look of melancholy. Several white and gray pigeons rest on the roof of the ancient temple halfway up the mountain, sometimes flying up and circling on the black ridge before resting down again. They have no intention of flying far away, perhaps they live in that ancient temple. Small birds can't bear to leave their old nests, and I, who am chronically ill with homesickness, can't help but have some feelings of sorrow stirred up by this.</p>
<p>In the garden decorated with temple pagodas, pine trees, canna flowers, variegated chrysanthemums, and bare plum branches, everyone sat down on the green and yellowish lawn, but I alone liked the cold and shady stone bench. They were planning a time to go back and a relatively free train. "Ah, what busy and hurried vulgar people," I cursed my companions secretly. But then I thought again, I was wrong, they all have families outside, unlike me, who is alone, stubbornly using cigarettes to stain the nails that my parents gave me yellow. Why don't I want to go back? It's just that my home is too far away, too far away. I can't leave the prison of life!</p>
<p>Although the sun is so good, it can't shine into my dark and cold heart. I have the melancholy of red leaves and the old age emotions of white reeds... but I am a young man, why not compare myself to those tall and handsome green pine trees? Why not compare myself to that magnificent rock? "Weak! Weak!" This ridicule seems to be coming from the green pine trees and rocks. I really can't stand it. I smoked cigarettes desperately.</p>

<p>Dunben (800) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Widow Visiting the Grave"</p>
<p>Cultivated good fortune to be fortunate for three lifetimes. Married a husband who was perfect in every way. A loving couple like fish and water. A jade girl and a golden boy complete a good deed. A perfect marriage envied by others. With talent, looks, and money. Who can compare with the joy of others? Nothing in the world can compare with this affection. Envy the mandarin ducks, even the immortals are not envious. Just teaching them to enjoy a lifetime of happiness. Unexpectedly, this perfection was resented by heaven. Disaster struck and illness befell. Gods and Buddhas were ineffective, and medicine was useless. Surprisingly, they snatched away the heart's desire. There was no way to grab the ground and call out to the heavens. From then on, I lived alone and sighed in solitude. Cold pillows and blankets saddened the Qing Dynasty. Feelingless and listless facing the curtain. Time passed quickly like a gap in a colt. The spring light in March is clear and bright. Another Qingming easily passed in a year. A sad person faces a sad festival. Feels even more grieved at this good time. Paper money burned everywhere on the tips of the grass. Every family offered wheat rice to mourn the dead. Look at the young widow. Carrying a grass basket to her husband's grave. Dressed in plain white, she looks elegant. The sad and mournful look is captivating. Personally threw the torches to burn. Bowed down to the tomb door. Rolling tears flowed from her eyes. The nightingale voice was soft and gentle. Telling her recent suffering in guarding. The more she cried, the more miserable and sad. The passers-by on the road shed tears together. Every sound is heart-breaking. If the souls in the ground are conscious. Should understand the servant's heart. Not eating fame and false reputation. Only because of not forgetting the old feelings. It's only pitiful. The white bones in the tomb have no spirituality. Never a word to comfort the widow. It teaches him that this hatred is endless and deep.</p>
<p>Na Ruiting's Hairpin Phoenix</p>
<p>Huiling (1380) 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Homesickness"</p>
<p>Went to the imperial court for fame. Good to sell talent and learning to the king. Young people enter the path of Qingyun. White-haired parents are desolate in the past. Marriage in the Prime Minister's mansion is not my wish. It only falls. Long departed from my hometown, leaving my hometown behind. Hometown. Who to rely on. Cai is, Zhang Lao. Xiao is also difficult to last long. Going on the road. Wanting to break my heart. Twelve hours thinking of my hometown. Ah, my parents. It's not that the children abandoned their parents. Forgetting the kindness of nurturing once and for all. But poetry and books delayed me. Now regret the shortcut article. Wife is young. Zhao Wuniang. Marriage in February broke the mandarin ducks. Locking up the charming body of the skirt. Why bother to offer delicious food to the venerable hall. Thinking in my heart. So miserable and hurt. Niu's father-in-law is ruthless. Holding my body tight. I should be the one with the name of unfilial piety. Sighing for a long time. Telling the blue sky. Ah, my parents. I don't know if my body is healthy. Wanting to go home but can't. Pitifully looking at my hometown every moment. One day, at Lu Shi, nine turns in my intestines.</p>

<p>Movies</p>
<h3>Grand Cathay Presents "Break of Hearts"</h3>
<p>One of RKO's Great Productions</p>
<p>Actress Katharine Hepburn, known as the "Second Greta Garbo" in Hollywood, has starred in such blockbusters as "Little Women" and "The Little Minister." This poignant and magnificent work, "Break of Hearts," considered a great production by RKO, also stars her. The film tells the story of a female composer and a famous musician's romance, full of love, separation, joy, and sorrow. The lines "Passionate love is often misled by affection, deep love breeds deep resentment" perfectly describe the characters in the play. The role played by Katharine Hepburn in this film is very suitable for her personality, making her performance particularly moving. The costumes are also lavish and magnificent, unmatched by any other film or star. The film is scheduled to premiere at the Grand Cathay today (Thursday).</p>
<h3>"The Boatman's Daughter" Continues to be a Hit</h3>
<p>Adding Newsreel of Hu Die's Wedding Today</p>
<p>The latest sound film "The Boatman's Daughter" from Mingxing Film Company has been playing to packed houses at the Jincheng Grand Theatre since its premiere. Yesterday, despite the snowfall, the audience remained crowded, proving that the film is truly moving. Some have praised it as Gao Zhanfei and Xu Lai's most successful work to date, and this is no exaggeration. To please the audience, the theater will also be adding a special screening of "Sound Newsreel of Hu Die's Wedding Ceremony" to each show starting today (Thursday). Everything from the various scenes in the ceremony hall to the trivial details in the bridal chamber is captured as much as possible. This is indeed a very interesting gift for the audience of "The Boatman's Daughter."</p>
<h3>Mingxing Diary</h3>
<p>Gao Zhanfei teases Hu Die in "Brothers," but in "Flowers of Spring," he is teased by Yan Rijian. Constantly switching emotions while filming "Brothers" and then "Flowers of Spring" requires a well-trained actor to handle.</p>
<p>Yan Yuexian plays a flirtatious singer in "Flowers of Spring" who loves to dress up and has countless boyfriends. Later, she falls into prostitution and commits suicide. During the filming of this scene the other day, Yan Yuexian's hand was injured by gunpowder, almost turning fiction into reality.</p>
<p>"Brothers" has a large-scale school set currently under construction, with more than ten scenes scheduled to be filmed there. It is expected that Hu Die's honeymoon vacation will be over by the time the set is completed.</p>
<p>"Flowers of Spring" satirizes the current crop of unethical male and female celebrities. The other day, while filming a scene where Gao Zhanfei played a temporary extra, a certain actress mistook him for the male celebrity she loved and pursued him vigorously, resulting in a humorous situation.</p>
<p>Xie Yunqing's portrayal of a blind man in "Flowers of Spring" is excellent.</p>
<p>Shu Xiuwen plays an old man in "Brothers," taking three hours each time for makeup.</p>
<p>Because Yan Yuewen plays a noble singer in "Flowers of Spring," several new costumes have been specially made for her.</p>
<p>Filming of "Peach Blossom After the Calamity" has been temporarily suspended due to Hu Die's honeymoon. "Love Letter" was filmed on location in western Shanghai the other day.</p>
<h3>Yihua News</h3>
<p>Difficult Shots in "Triumphant Song"</p>
<p>"Triumphant Song"—is Bu Wancang's latest masterpiece. The main body of the work has already been filmed. All that remains are the levee opening scenes.</p>
<p>But the opening scenes of this historical drama are proving difficult because they require seven or eight hundred actors, all of whom must be shirtless. The reason, needless to say, is related to the plot. But in this cold weather, getting these actors to strip naked to film the scenes is problematic. Therefore, Bu Wancang feels greatly challenged. But the scene must be filmed. Yes, as soon as the weather clears, they will have to grit their teeth and work.</p>
<p>"Wedding Night" Breaks Work Records</p>
<p>Yue Feng's new work, "Wedding Night," which focuses on marital problems, depicts domestic disputes, and analyzes love affairs between young men and women, is being actively pursued with extreme intensity every day. Over eighty percent has now been completed. According to people in the company, it is breaking all previous records in every aspect. Therefore, not only is Yue Feng complaining bitterly, but all the staff members are also complaining endlessly because they have not had a moment's rest.</p>
