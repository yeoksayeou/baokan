<p>阿斯瑪拉　意軍前綫來電報告意軍已攻克阿杜華鎭、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>阿斯瑪拉　意軍於已往四十八小時內在阿杜華附近作極猛烈之戰鬥後、已於今日攻克阿杜華古城、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）伊利特里之阿斯瑪拉意軍戰報雖稱阿杜華業已陷落、但今日羅馬發表之公報紀阿比西尼亞戰事進行情形者、並未述及此節、據公報宣稱、桑蒂尼將運統率之第一軍團已樹意旗於阿杜華北面之阿狄拉特。古砲臺遺址、居民與敎士均已降服、第二軍團進抵阿杜華山谷之邊者、今晨續向前進、東南部之意軍短戰後、已佔據傑洛古比鎮（六日路透電）</p>

<h3>日內瓦急轉直下　孰爲侵略國亟待判定　國聯組成六人委會研究　爲對意行施制裁之聲</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）阿代表哈華利特今日於國聯行政院舉行重要會議時正式謂求對意採用國聯盟約第十六條規定之制裁辦法、行政院考慮十三人委員會之報吿書、但尙未通過之、因意阿雙方代表甫接此報吿書原文、須向本國政府請訓故也、行政院指定英·法·西班牙·羅馬尼亞·葡萄牙·智利·六國代表組成六人委員會、就爭議國之報吿研究局勢、而决定孰爲侵略國、大約星期一日六人委員會可决定此點、俟侵略國判定後、國聯方可採行第二步驟、卽考慮制裁是也、日內瓦一般人士以爲目前局勢終必趨入採用制裁之途、此誠國聯有史以來之創舉也、</p>
<p>國聯大會已定期於星期三午後四時開會、屆時或將採行關於制裁之第一步驟、英代表艾登主張新組織之六人委員會立卽着手工作、此項主張現已實現、足見行政院决計不再延宕、六人委員會今夜集議一小時、推定葡代表孟悌羅爲主席、定明日午後再行集議、同時並諭令秘書處預備關於此案之全部案卷一份、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯今日開始確認意國爲對阿戰爭之戎首、是爲實施制裁之先聲、國聯行政院今夜另推英·法·俄·葡·丹麥·及智利六國爲起草委員會、另製報吿書、限於星期一提交行政院正式討論、國聯大會亦决星期三開會、日內瓦方面頗有急轉直下之勢、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）衆意制裁將否實行、今已不成問題、惟制裁應取何種性質、尙待作决耳、昨日國聯行政院所指定研究新局勢並决定孰爲侵略國之六人委員會、其報吿書將必致判决意國之違背國聯盟約第十條第十二條第十五條條文、此爲確然無疑者、預料此報吿必由行政院一致通過、於是將移送國聯大會　而由該大會於星期三日午後四時開會、成立委員會、以决定在目前之情勢中能實施何種制裁、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>行政院前日開會　空氣極形緊張　十一委會提出報告書　國聯大會星期三召集</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）今晚六時行政院開會接受十三人委員會之報吿書時、會塲爲之人滿、空氣甚形緊張、時局之嚴重、觀各人之面色卽可知之、意代表阿洛錫與阿代表哈華利特在馬蹄形之案相對而坐、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院於本日午後開會、首先舉行非公開會議、由英·法·蘇聯·羅馬尼亞·阿根廷·赤道國·智利·西班牙·澳洲·波蘭·丹麥·等十三國代表出席、意大利代表阿洛錫及阿比西尼亞代表哈華利特則在會塲鄰室等候、至午後六時舉行公開會議、意阿代表始出席會議、</p>
<p>意代表力自辯護</p>
<p>首由意國代表阿洛錫宣讀長篇演說、略謂國聯行政院不願就實際觀點審察局勢、此層最爲意國政府所遺憾、意國政府認爲意大利在多年來遭阿國繼續不斷之俊略、今若不明阿比西尼亞之實際情形、僅作表面之判斷、則勢必誤認侵略者爲被侵略者、至於外國一部分輿論仇視意國、係別有用意、與意阿衝突無關、此次意國軍事行勁、則係因阿國動員所引起之反響云（五日哈瓦斯電）末謂意政府深感行政院之努力、惟國聯當已明悉並盼望第一事所須考慮者、厥爲阿比西尼亞無參加國聯之資格云、（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>阿代表請求制裁</h3>
<p>次由阿國代表哈華利特宣讀本日午後所發表阿比西尼亞政府致國聯會之照會、（見另電）並謂阿國雖屢受意國軍事威脅、然阿國動員令、則延遲至最後一分鐘始行頒發、阿國茲請求國聯會行政院採取盟約第十六條所載之程序、並立卽命意國政府停止軍事行動云、至是、行政院主席阿根廷代表齊那格宣稱、行政院於下星期一日績行開會、投票通過行政院關於意阿爭端之報吿書、行政院乃於六點四十五分散會、又聞本日行政院非公開會議、根據十三國委員會之建議、次定於下星期三日召集國聯大會、俾令犬會判定侵略屬於何方、國聯大　判　侵略國以後、並將另行組織起草委員會、起草制裁方案、又本日行政院會議、已委託英。法。蘇聯·葡萄牙·智利。丹麥六國代表、根據十三國委員會所擬之報告書、（見另電）另行編撰行政院報告書、俾於下星期一日會議中提付表决、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>十三國委員會　報告書會文　阿國內情已今非昔比　證明意方行動之不當</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）十三國委員會本日向國聯行政院提出關於意阿爭端起源及經過情形之報吿書、該報告書、歷陳意阿兩國關係之過去現在情形、備極詳盡、其中分析九月四日意國向國聯會提出之備忘錄及阿國之答辯、尤富於興味、略謂意國備忘錄中、表示不滿於阿國共有三點、（一）東菲洲意屬邊境未獲安全、（二）阿國不履行該國加入國聯會時所担任之義務、（三）阿國內部擾亂不寗、嗣後阿國政府於九月十四日送致國聯會照會、提議由國聯會派調査團、赴當地調査意國所認爲不滿之點、惟十三國委員會則以就目前情勢、無法派遣調査團赴該處、實堪遺憾、至意國備忘錄所稱意屬邊境未獲安全一層、報吿書指出英法兩國東菲洲屬地昆連阿國之邊境、亦時遭侵犯、發生事端、然英法兩國輒就外交途徑、設法解决、十三國委員會相信卽有侵犯邊境情事、亦並未具有侵略性質，且均係當地部落之所爲、阿國中央政府從未加以鼓勵、關於意國備忘錄之第二點、報吿書承認阿皇雖以一切可能方法、禁絕奴隸制度、然實際上仍少進步、關於意國備忘錄之第三點、報吿書謂一九二三年阿國加入國聯會時、阿國國內擾亂情形、本爲當時担保阿國加入國聯會之國家所諗悉、目前阿國內部情形、則並未較一九二三年更爲惡劣反之、就表面觀察、阿國內部確已較曩時更爲統一而强固、阿國需要外國合作及援援助、以改善其國內情况、此層則阿國代表於本年九月十一日在國聯大會所發表之演說中、固已加以承認矣、總之關於阿國之</p>

<p>問題、苟不以尊重國聯會各會員國之獨立完整及安全爲基礎、殊無其他解决之道、又査意國備忘錄、係於本年九月四日送達國聯會、然阿國則係於去年十二月十四日第一次向國聯會提出申請、當阿國提出申請後、意國政府反對由國聯會行政院討論意阿問題、而繼續派遣軍隊赴東菲洲、自意阿爭端開始以來、阿比西尼亞政府始終謀和平解决、阿國並接受且請求派中立觀察員、赴當地調査、反之、意國於華爾華爾衝突事件仲裁解决以後、仍要求對阿國自由行動、且再三聲明、阿國情形、係屬特殊、不能滴用國聯會盟約、以謀解决云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>兩項建議</p>
<p>十三委員會之報告建議就上述之建議觀之、如意國停止戰爭、而撤退其在阿軍隊、現方可根據盟約第十五條卽規定以行政院機關和平解决爭議者進行談判、如盟約第十二條果如預料、査明實被侵犯、則制裁辦法自當採行、而辦理採行制裁事之委員會亦卽將成立、</p>
<p>制裁步驟</p>
<p>第一步之制裁將爲經濟與財政之性質、而會員國與按略國間之外交關係之斷絕、亦在此計畫之內、第二步將爲被侵略國軍火接濟禁令之取消、與侵略國各種接濟之禁絕、（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>阿政府致文國聯　請對意施制裁　援用盟約第十六條二節　保衛國土誓必抵抗到底</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）阿比西尼亞政府頃復向國聯會秘書處送遞照會一伴、內稱、「阿比西尼亞政府敬向國聯會行政院堅决申請、請其根據阿國皇帝前電所報吿之事實、官佈依照國聯會盟約第十六條之解釋、意大利業已從事戰爭、因此盟約第十六條第一節所規定之後果、（卽從事侵略之國家、應視爲對於國聯全體會員國有戰爭之行爲、其他會員國卽應施以經濟金融的制裁）事實上應作爲業已成立、阿比西尼亞政府更請求行政院履行盟約第十六條第二節所載明之義務、（卽行政院應建議各關係國政府、作有効之軍事措施、以維持盟約之効力、）以使破壞法紀及神聖約束之武裝衝突、迅卽終止、阿比西尼亞政府茲宣佈阿國人民準備流最後一滴之血、以保衛阿國獨立與領土完整、堅强不屈、以抵抗此不義之戰爭、彼敵國軍隊縱具有優越之武器、且殘忍暴戾誅戳無厭、然阿國民衆亦斷不俛首於暴力之前、蓋阿國民衆深知不僅爲保衛阿國而犧牲、實亦爲一切弱小國家之獨立而犧牲、被强暴之侵略國家苟任其獲得勝利、不加抵抗、則凡世界上弱小之國家、其將咸爲魚肉矣、職是之故、阿國政府茲再申請國聯會、重行聲明條約必須尊重、戰爭實爲非法、不勝迫切待命」云（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國實施　軍火禁令　予國聯制裁以便利　倫敦日內瓦表歡迎</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅總統今日發出通吿、謂意阿間現有戰爭狀熊之存在、故美國中立案所規定禁止軍火運往交戰國之辦法、當然實施有效云、此項禁令以軍火爲限、但不及於原料、其所禁者包括各種來復槍與機關槍·各種彈藥·各種戰艦·各種飛機·不分軍用或民用·整個或零件·及飛機引擎·芥末瓦斯·與火熖噴發器等物、據國務院近所發表之統計觀之、美國軍火素鮮運往阿國者、故阿國不受此項禁令之影響、惟意國則將喪失飛機配件與引擎之來源、至於其他軍火對意之輸出、殊無關重要、羅總統刻仍在賀斯敦號巡艦上、旣接國務院關於意阿戰爭之正式報吿後、卽决定發表上述文吿、於是發無綫電致國務總理赫爾囑其依此辦理、羅總統同時發表下述言言論、「吾人雖抱戰爭可以避免之希望、吾人雖作在此方面之努力、但吾人現惟有承認意阿軍隊刻已交綏之簡單確實的事實、而中立案所指之戰爭狀熊現已存任、在此種特殊環境下、余欲使國人了解者、仟何人民凡自動與交戰國任何一方作任何形式之交易者自冒危險云」、羅總統此言、對於與交戰國交易之國人不予以任何保護、較諸中立案所規定者更進一步、按參議員克拉克等前曾有此種提議、但未爲國會所通過、細繹羅總統之言論美國不欲正式保護開往交戰國之船貨、不欲反對國聯或任何他國之封鎖行爲、亦不欲堅持中立國通商之權利、（五日路透電）美政府之决計厲行軍火運往意阿兩國之禁令、英政界與國聯各界皆熱切歡迎、覺美國此舉已予國聯行政院重要之頒導、並視之爲一種「邀請進制裁、美國不加干涉」之供獻、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>柏林報紙　觀察東菲戰局　意軍限於地理制勝匪易　有擴爲英意衝突之可能</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國各界人土、對於意阿衝突、均感極大之興味、德國各大報紙均特派訪員、赴意阿前綫觀戰、德國軍事專家對於意國能否戰勝、頗多懷疑、以爲意國雖具備新式武器、然阿國地理上之困難、將使新式武器失其效用、若干人士則以爲英意兩國或有引起武裝衝突之可見？苟然、則自必有利於德國、至於一般德人則均反對意大利、以爲如因一國文化落後、卽可藉口加以進攻、則理由殊未充分、蓋若然、則數年以後德國亦可假借法國採用民主制度、較德國政治更爲落後、而向法國進攻矣、國社黨方面亦不贊成意國、則以墨案里尼反對德國合併奥國故也、若干國社黨報紙對於意國本多不滿、以爲意國之法西斯主義與德國之國社主義並不相同、在歐洲方法意國之法西斯制度名譽較佳、故不免加以忌嫉、但意阿衝突發生後、斯德萊薩會議所建立之英法意三國聯合綫一旦破裂、頗爲國社黨所欣喜、惟見英法兩國關係愈益增進、則又不免快快也、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>國際制裁之困難問題</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>國際聯盟自成立至气。對於盟約十六條中關於制裁之規定。從未應用。滿洲事件。以英國之不願負責。國聯工作。至調解失敗。侵略事實成功而止。今意軍已攻陷阿杜華。國聯之報吿書。亦已發表。盟約十五條之工作旣竟。十六條中之工作。必須開始。制裁之是否實施。爲一問題。實施之程度及範圍。又一問題。實施之有否效果。有否危險。更成問題。近者。英國方面。爲喚起法國及美國之注意。曾表示對此問題之態度。一則曰如實施制裁。凡有勢力之國家皆須圈入。二則曰制裁實施後。必不可因非會員國之行爲而致失敗。前者蓋對在國聯以內之法國等言。深慮其取隔牆觀火或下井投石之伎倆。後者蓋對國聯以外之美國等言。深恐其幸災樂禍。趁火打刦。因博漁人之利。而爲　牆之爭。英國之處境良苦。國聯之弱點已甚顯露。而制裁問題之困難。亦彰彰矣。</p>
<p>按盟約十六條之規定。乃所以使盟約第十條得維持其神聖。第十條內容。爲國聯之會員國。對於每一會員國之領土完整及政治獨立。均予以尊重及保障。國無大小。一旦受他國之侵略。則國聯全體。負責盡此項保障之義務。所謂制裁者。卽對侵略國之懲罰。使其事先有所懼。而事後有所悔也。十六條所列之制裁方法。為經濟之制裁武力之制裁。及政治之制裁。政治制裁者。開除侵略國之國聯會籍也。其無損於侵略國。吾人可於日本之。往事證明之武力制裁。向爲一部分國家所反對。以爲以暴易暴。非和平之本意。故盟約中僅規定國聯得建議某某數國之捐助海陸空軍。及諸國之不遏止國際軍之過境。然捐助與否。固各國之自由。無服從之義務也。經濟制裁。乃制裁諸法中之較有希望者。然依歷屆國聯人會之决議。各國之參加制裁與否。概由各國政府自行决定。參加之程度。亦不勉强。如地理上事實上有困難。亦可免予參加。觀乎此。則制裁條文之無力。顯而易見。而欲以十六條維持第十條之神聖。蓋亦難矣。</p>
<p>然國際制裁困難之重心所在。非爲條文法律。而爲實際之政治。第一。世界最强有力國家。如美國如日本。非國聯之會員。無維護盟約之義務。第二。國聯以內各强國。因環境之不同。安全要求之迥異。寗以國聯爲外交及政治之工具。而不以國聯爲理想及目的。故滿洲事件。英以借日本自重而拒絕美國之要求。阿比西尼亞問題。法以借意大利自重而無接受英國領導之决心。同床異夢。各是其是。第三。連帶責任及集體和平之觀念。尙不能戰勝國家主權至上之觀念。世界五十餘　。有五十餘最髙意志。各以為本國利益爲最後决定之條件。如欲加拿大之封　意大利。欲挪威之援助阿比西尼亞。均寧實上之不可能者。第四。各國經濟之互相依賴。與日俱進。如封鎖意大利。則許多國家之藉意大利之原料及意大利之巿塲爲生者。將見失業增加。工廠閉門。第五。戰爭之原因未消滅。帝國主義諸國中。有滿意者。有未得滿意者。民族主義諸國中。有侵及他民族者。有被他民族俊及者。而此種現狀之維持。其中難免有不公平原因存在。而制裁規定。又僅爲維持此現狀耳。凡此諸因。均爲政治性質。固非條文之修改。一二國家之効忠所可救濟者也。</p>

<h3>意阿戰爭之展望　爲維持國內統治權故作攻阿戰　事件若擴大英法將先加入漩渦</h3>
<p>法之庇意、於前次英德定海軍恊約、亦有關係英德定海軍協約、直不啻英助德興起與法國爲難、是以法國對於此次意阿糾紛之態度、轉若無視英之利害者、對於英之提議共同戰綫問題、不置可否、愈足見法庇意之露骨表示矣、</p>
<p>（四）事件擴大下去則如何</p>
<p>惟意阿戰爭　長下去、事件擴大、若英國捲人漩渦、則法國亦必將與英合流、共同制意、</p>
<p>英國外交、素以狡狐　稱、英意間若發生戰事、法國不予爲力、則英國必亦將置身於歐洲大陸事件之外、專力應付殖民地、如是、則歐洲大陸集圑之和平機構將完全崩潰、而保障法國之羅加諾條約、必被撕毀無餘、是以法國在外交原則上、仍以與英國協力維持歐洲之現狀爲前提、英法聯合戰綫制意之可能性、仍較大也、</p>
<p>法外相曾訊問英外相云、「英政府旣堅持擁護國聯規約、設若一旦歐洲大陸發生侵略行爲、例如第三國（指德國）侵略奧國之獨立和平、於時英國仍能表示决意乎、」論者又謂法已允許於意擊英時、立予援助云云、確亦爲可信之言、總之、意阿戰爭、若英被牽入漩渦、法亦必立時出動、意阿戰爭、雖未必即直接牽起歐洲大戰、但成爲將來歐亂之因了、則爲毫無疑義、觀於德國沈默無言、意大利之、味蠻幹，蓋可見信矣、</p>
<p>（一）意攻阿戰之必然性</p>
<p>意阿戰爭業已爆發、推原厥始、無寗謂爲意大利企圖遠王阿比西尼亞而發、觀於未接觸前、阿比西尼亞俯首聽英國向國聯提議和平解决之態度可知、實則阿比西尼亞自一九〇六年被英法意一國對阿劃分勢力範圍以來、不啻已成爲國際共管之屬地、讓步旣至於極、然意大利此次又何故必欲征阿歟、</p>
<p>綜合各方面之報道及內測意大利內部所蘊結之矛盾、可知意之攻阿、綠有所出、（一）意大利本國、缺乏天然資源、爲缺乏帝國主義之人口問題、故需要施行國家膨脹政策刦略殖民地、（二）在意獲得資源之　利及因緣關係上、以阿爲最適宜之目的地、（三）意之西政權樹立之近數年來、財政經濟上、屢見破綻、又對國民漸取高壓政策、因而國民漸生反感、莫梭利尼擬以對外作戰籍移國民　綫、（四）莫梭　尼欲增高國民對彼之信仰、　鼓吹意民之復仇思想藉　三十餘年前　阿戰敗之　、並以　阿意　民地、（五）　國脫離國以來歐洲均勢　倒、法國爲對德不得不與意妥恊意　此時機、征阿最宜、</p>
<p>意人利自决定攻阿以來準備已一年有餘、在過去年間所用去之軍費、旣逹八億黎拉、遣派之兵力亦有二十萬、因而財政上之赤字續增、輸出貿易亦漸衰、是以莫氏乃以殖民政策、國家膨脹、人種鬥爭、阿杜華復　仇　巧妙之詞、爲攻阿之口實、實際上另有必然性在也、</p>
<p>（二）意攻阿戰與英國</p>
<p>意攻阿之最大障碍、即爲英國、意躁躇甚久者、亦　因不知對英之策峪如何耳、惟英國反對意大利攻阿之理由、謂意之侵略行爲、直破壞歐洲集團之和平機構云云、前於九月四日國聯開理事會時、英代表艾登一再陳言、願擁護國聯之和平原电調解意阿糾紛、實　國聯不過為英法作倀之機關、果能擁護和平、前之中日糾紛、又何會發生、</p>
<p>英之不願意攻阿者實因自已之領土與阿昆　、保全阿之形式獨立、即所以維護在菲之殖民權益、試觀阿比西尼亞地理之情勢、槪可以見、蓋阿在英·法·意·三國殖民地環繞之中、三國在阿之權益關係、極爲錯綜複雜、十九世紀中葉阿　梭馬利蘭及埃利托利亞與意、當時對阿關係、幾有意大利獨佔權益之勢、後經一九〇六年之英、法·意·二國條約、乃　阿爲三國均勢之範圍、亦即英法共同牽制意大利之舉、今日英對意之態度、亦仍在維持其在阿之固有勢力耳、</p>
<p>一九二三年、法國引阿入國聯之時、吾人尙記憶英國表示反對之意、其所持理由、正與今日莫索利尼對阿詆毀之言辭相侔、謂阿爲野蠻國家、尙有奴隸制度存在、奚足以齒列幽聯諸文明國家之中、言猶在耳、豈英人之健忘、特英國不願意之攻阿、意若勝阿、則英國在阿之權益、將岌岌不保、阿若不　、而英在菲之殖民地、將續起反抗、並足以影響其他英殖民地弱小民族之反抗意識、俱與英不利、英所願者、在維持現狀、</p>
<p>（三）意攻阿與法國</p>
<p>冉申言法對意阿糾紛之態度、先須明瞭法在阿權益之性質、法在阿之權益、與意英不同、意在領土埃利托利亞與意屬梭馬利蘭間、設有鐵路、始則欲奪取阿比西尼亞之鑛產及資源、繼則欲阿成爲意之保護領地、而英國在尼羅河沿岸之埃及·蘇丹、栽種棉花、為英本國棉業原料之供給地、坎蘇兩地之灌溉、取水於尼羅、尼羅河之宣洩、史出自阿之茲那湖、若斷茲那湖之水源、英之埃蘇　區、將成爲荒土、故英對阿權益之爭亦烈、惟法對阿之熊度則　不同、法在阿已有專利之　路、目對阿多文化施設、發展之途尙遠、對阿不若意英之積極、但不願阿為意英任何　所專有、</p>
<p>法　惱　爲德、至希特拉　葉　、愈覺不能安枕、故對於殖民地之關心寗可謂較對歐洲大陸爲次要、而自德脫離國聯、復活　兵、並企圖對奥合併以　、法對德之　手投足、無不敏憾危急、於是對於此次意阿糾　、論謂意早已得法之諒解、蓋亦由法之因對德政策而庇意所見以得也、</p>

<p>車戶會議堅决反對</p>
<p>査本市塌中老虎中　、兩業相較、老虎車較塌車多至四分之三、老虎車約計一萬三千輛、塌車約計三千躲輛、故此次反對加捐、亦以老虎車業較爲激烈、迭經同業磋商之下、乃由車戶代表沈　·鄒世松·陳實祥·等數十人、發起召集全市老虎車、業代表大會、討論反對工部局增捐辦法、於七月七日下午二時、假南通旅滬同鄉會會所、召集全市車戶代表大會、到五百餘人、經討論結果、决定辦法、（一）組織上海市老虎車業互助會、以資增厚實力、一致團結對外、（二）推定代表向租界納稅華人會請願、要求代向工部局交涉、停止加捐、（三）秋季捐待交涉解决後繳納、（四）必要時通吿全體老虎車戶、携帶車輛至工部局請願、不達加捐目的、誓不讓步、（五）發表宣言、</p>

<p>自塌車與老虎車聯合組織後、反對加捐空氣、愈趨尖銳化、致頗爲工部局注意、爰每日派探至本會籌備處、探視動靜、而各捕房竟以各車戶各車抗捐爲由、扣押車輛、日漸增多、致各車戶車戶均營業難安、効形恐怖、紛紛至本會籌備庭、要求救濟保護、乃於十八日特派沈鏞·程中道·高有餘·等、率領被扣車戶、前赴納稅華人會再度請願、要求工部局轉飭各捕房、根據何會辦虞華董論知、在交涉未解决之前、老執照准予通用、勿得扣留車輛、故意留難、當承該會主席王曉箱先生、允爲代向工部局解釋被扣車輛、始得由各捕房先後開釋、</p>

<p>自經本會在籌備期內、本百折不撓冉接再厲之精神、向各界籲請交涉後、工部局方面、始於七月十九日委員會議、議决、准予取消加捐、經提交該局七月二十四日董事會採納通過、函復租界納稅華人會轉知本會查照、於是本會籌備處即通吿全體車戶、仍照章繳納秋季車捐、至此反對增捐、始得工都局諒解、達到圓滿目的、</p>

<h3>李惠堂勇健不减當年　香港足球隊小試脚頭　十比零昨大勝西捕　港隊實力堅强表演有聲有色　一萬五千觀衆看得色舞眉飛</h3>
<p>出席全運會之香港足球隊、實力雄厚、對本屆全運、頗具奪標、爲練習脚頭起見、昨日特爲本埠西捕作友誼賽於申園、港隊隊長球王李惠堂、與滬人關別五年、昨日亦出塲作戰、一時聞風慕名往觀者、自午後起、已絡綵於途、未曾開賽、中園四座、已擠得水洩不通、人山人海、後來者竟無立足之地、人數當在一萬五千以上、爲近來罕見之盛况、比賽結果、港隊不費氣力、牛刀小試、以十比零之鉅數、將西捕打得落花流水、上半時七比零、李惠堂英勇如昔、獨進六隻、其技藝之佳、一萬五千觀衆、看得五體投地大呼滿意、</p>
<p>一點球百出不愧大王</p>
<p>李惠堂之技般藝如何爲一般人所急於知道李爲全隊之靈魂、率領三軍、指揮一切、設無李在、局面或不至如此、其盤球之妙、使對方無從捉摸、呌好之聲、不絕於耳、在門前之不慌不亂、鎮靜之工夫、殊非一般人所及、六球之中、妙球凡三、第一次門前迂迥而進、守門顧左失右、李以曲綫式之路綫射入、下半時二次守門衝出、李之巧避輕挑、在守門回身一顧之時、豈料球已進網、其妙無比、射門尙佳、勁力不減、砰砰作響、難怪比賽之後、尙有千餘觀衆、追隨李後、以一見爲榮也、李惠堂之次、印象最深者、當爲左翼鄭季良、輕巧如飛、難得之人才也、</p>
<p>個人技術　各有千秋</p>
<p>個人技術、除李惠堂雄健如昔、獨進六球外、其他如包家平、臨危不亂、迭救險球、後衛以客串譚江柏（因譚氏此來係代表廣東、出席全運會、）英勇可取、而梁賢贊、亦無瑕可疵、中衛綫當推李國威爲最取佳、黄美順梁榮照亦穩健果敢、前鋒球王李惠堂、自嘸啥話頭、鄭季良慓悍英俊、卓金石、黎兆榮、後生可長、造詣不凡、惟曹桂成昨日表演、似較爲遜色耳、西捕在滬西人足球隊中，尙屬勁旅、昨日交鋒之下、全處被攻地位、雖有數次反攻、但終未能如願、球殊難逼近香港隊後防、開西捕在滬上空前慘敗之紀錄、比數之鉅、殊非該隊始料所及、</p>
<p>三分鐘內　一連兩隻</p>
<p>銀笛一鳴、香港隊即在中綫開球、球王李惠堂率領前鋒、一擁而入、當由黎兆榮攻入一球、旋又由卓石金照樣一隻、兩球之得、前後僅三分鐘、誠驚人之作、李惠堂在二十碼處罰任意球、未能得手、乃賣弄解數、現出眞實本領、單檢獨入、將抵門前、翻身下馬、臥地射入、愛德門初試球王絕技、抵禦無方、祗得點頭稱讀、目送入網、</p>
<p>勢如破竹　共進七球</p>
<p>西捕連失三球、拚命反攻、費盡九牛二虎之力、始得攻進香港隊防地、伍萊拉起一脚、被包鋼門擋出、惠律又來一腿、家平左右開弓、雙拳齊舞、化險爲夷、李球王得黎兆榮之傳球、提起鐵腿、又射中一隻、此球之進、淸晰美觀、黎兆榮再來一個、李惠堂單槍匹馬、盤進三關、建功而返、鄭季良殺進邊境、如出入無人之境、李惠堂漁人得利、造成上半時七比零</p>
<p>相差太遠　戰情漸鬆</p>
<p>戰幕再揭、香港隊以勝利在握、而西捕亦鑒於反攻無效、未免志氣頽喪、故雙方均不若上半時之激烈周旋、久之黎兆榮得黄美順之接濟、攻入第八球、卓石金兩次妙射、鄭季良隔山探寳、愛德門生意興隆、迎送不暇、推納竭力撑持、方始暫以偏安、無何球王帶劍長驅、終被闖入、愛德門當前迎奪、李球王避開鋒頭、輕起一脚、從容入網、</p>
<p>球王妙技　計射空門</p>
<p>西捕此次乃亡命反攻、香港隊稍為客氣、至累及包鋼門手脚交運、久已冷落之香港隊門前、又呈熱帽、李國威救球出險、李惠堂馬上進入西捕防地、愛德門救球心切、被他調虎離山、輕離防地、祗望向前迎截惠堂來球、不料惠堂計上心來、以脚將球挑過愛德門、射入空門、下半時結果三比零、</p>
<p>總結果十比零、香港隊勝、茲將雙方陣綫列後、</p>

<h3>海行勞頓行裝甫卸　林望蘇陳其安昨受挫　王文正以逸待勞戰勝陳其安　林望蘇精神不振敗於徐煒培</h3>
<p>參加本屆全運大會之馬華網球錦標選手林望蘇陳其安、及阮國英楊龍章、昨日出席上海網球會表演、二時起、在康悌路上海會球塲舉行、是以競爭興趣、較第一日之表演、更爲濃厚、左臂將軍林望蘇、爲歷年馬華冠軍、林寳藥邱飛海、均曾一度敗於其手、陳其安乃新進名將、去年馬華錦標、此次返國出席全運、錦標大有探之囊中之勢、但昨二人表寅失常、竟相繼參敗、實因每行勞頓、行裝甫御、精神猶未恢復之故、比賽共有四塲、競爭頗烈、尤以林徐單打、更爲精彩、自始至終、局勢緊張、惟觀衆不多、僅百餘人而已、藍受申園香港對西捕足球賽之影響也、茲將比賽結果列後、</p>
<p>王文正克陳其安</p>
<p>午後二時、馬華全體蒞塲、競賽於是開始、馬來亞上屆單打冠軍陳其安、球藝尙佳、正反手亦均可取、惟發球軟弱、每予王文正截擊之機會、致敗之因、亦稽於是、王文正底綫長抽、重而有力、或深入兩角、或沿邊直入、使對方不及挽救、第一盤開始、雙方勢均力敵、各得兩局、入後王文正振作精神、一氣呵成四局、遂以六比二獲勝、第二盤起、王復抰戰勝餘威、長驅直入、連下三城、繼被陳其安奪回一局、王以三比一領前、後王再加三局、以五比一局佔絕對優勢、是時王以爲穩取荊州、隨便應付、不　陳其安沉淸應戰、乘　而入、亦運勝三局、僅以四比五落後、下局陳發球、滿望一舉成功、打成平手、惟王見良機不可再失、何能再事數衍、遂奮起力抗、果然得勝而帿、結果六比四、</p>

<p>單打賽畢、天忽下雨、遂停賽片刻、是時卡爾生德孚等尙未到塲、臨時拉夫、由徐潤培陳志强、与马华选手阮国英楊龍章客串雙方球藝、軒輊難分、比較楊阮稍髙一籌、競爭尙稱劇烈、一球勝負、須來往十數次、而每局又須數度平等、方判高下、故鏖戰二盤、費時二小時、第一盤徐陳聲勢極盛、以六比三得勝、第二盤阮楊竭力掙扎、小心應付、以六比四奪回、第三盤徐陳極有獲勝可能、先以三比零局佔前、後徐陳心急慌忙、野球迭見、自殺頻仍、乃被阮楊追成各三平手、繼徐陳雖曾以四比三再度超出、但好景不常阮楊連下三局、以六比四結束第三盤、</p>
<p>徐煒培巧取望蘇</p>
<p>渴望已久之林望蘇、對徐煒培之單打賽、繼之登塲、林爲馬來亞冠軍徐爲香港盟主、兩雄相遇、一决雌雄戰情緊張、早在意中、望蘇左手執拍揮動自如、惟因到滬朱久、舟車勞頓且塲地生疏、故其表演不能裝滿人意、小徐昨日表演特佳、出球峻急、且善奔跑、而切球更爲巧妙、每使望蘇望球興嘆、徒喚奈何、開賽之初、徐煒培連勝二局、繼以三比一、四比二、五比三、一路領前林望蘇見時機危急、力自振作、奮勇直追、兩角長抽、顏施壓迫、果然不負衆望、亦勝三局、反以六比五超前、下局林發球、因其球勢軟弱、被徐造成和局、後徐再加二局、以八比六歸徐獲勝、第二盤起、林鑒於第一盤之慘敗鎭靜應戰、以三比一局佔先、徐亦顯以顏色、打成各三平手、林又取得徐之發球局、再以四比二三領前、惟林似已力竭、奔跑遲慢、對於徐之切球、無法應付、遂被徐連勝三局、六比四由得第二盤、</p>
<p>卡德雙打勝邱何</p>
<p>壓軸戱爲卡爾生德孚、對邱飛海何家　之雙打賽、開賽時已五時有餘、卡德均係沙塲健將、大刀闊斧、出球淸晰、邱何雖亦名手、但人老珠黄、體格欠强、且天時不早、黑白難分、更覺應付爲難、幸卡爾生因爲表演性質、敷衍對付、未出全力、否則邱何實不堪一擊也、第一盤開始、何發球失利、卡德連勝繼造成四比一之局面、邱何追上二局、卡德照樣還敬、以六比三結束、第二盤邱何竭力　作、曾以二比一、三比二、四比三佔前、卡德打成各四平手後、再各加一局成各五和局、是時天色黑暗、就此停賽、</p>

<p>這一番話也便是他對童子們告別之辭，因爲他下來時他們正在穀倉殺討論這件事，他郤不要乃德去呌他們。門口停了　輛車子，裴夫人出去向唐恩說話，她臉上一種的　傷使他看了心裂，他於是輕　問道：</p>
<p>『許我再和坦第一面嗎？』</p>
<p>『當然可以；進去吻他一下罷。他不見了他的唐納，也要難過得很。』</p>
<p>他俯身在搖籃上面，只見那小臉兒一見他便亮了起來，　至於　恩自己眼裏的神色急樣，郤沒人看見　同時他又聽見　夫人哀求道：</p>
<p>『我們不能再給這個可憐的孩子一個　會嗎？　力子：』接下，裴先生即以其果斷的語氣回答道：</p>
<p>『親愛的，這不是頂好的辦法，所以讓他姑且到無害於人有益於已的地方，去住多少時候，他不久會歸來的，你看罷。』</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （吉人）</p>
<p>「惟女子與小人，爲難養也，近之則不遜，遠之則怨」。涉世未深的我，一　不明瞭這幾句「聖言」的分量，可是，這幾年來，四處跑跑，與社會接觸的機會也比較多了，始信孔孑的言論，雖遠隔幾千年，還是沒有兩樣，的確「一語論定」的了。試問：女子與小人的行徑，是不是社會上所剷除不盡的？是不是沒有了這種人物，就要不成其爲社會的？敢以質諾高明。</p>
<p>「人攙了不走，鬼　了直跑」，這是兩句個語，做人的擇交，不可不愼，有擔當的人和不甘沒落的人，更應當有一種「知人」和知」之明。眼江是要緊的。</p>
<p>「臨深履薄」，是謙謙君子之風，今人一旦得志，大有「惟我獨尊」，「舍我其誰」之概。要知樹大招風，有朝錯誤，方悟風帆扯得太足，其危險就更甚於一切。</p>
<p>出身貧苦，往往會得成功大事業，大偉人。</p>
<p>慣於「偸鷄剪綹」的朋友，一旦捏到職權，就會防人家也要學它那般的「偸雞剪綹」起來，所以着着防人，惟恐不週，不過，一個人有一個人的「品格」一個人有一個人的「來歷」，枉費心計；徒討沒趣，何苦來</p>
<h3>總動員令</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>聼到『動員』兩個字，不由得心頭就要跳躍起來，因爲這是開戰的陣綫上，一道火把向前燒去，不論那日內瓦的國聯，很莊嚴的一座和平機關，也就立刻衝破，而許多的盟約，更似霎時間摧毁得凈盡；唉！何况現在『動員』兩字上下，又加了『總』和『令』那末：可見全國一致的向敵方殺出，而沒有一個不走集在這個命令之下，所以可伯的是『動員』，最怕的尤其是『總動員令』。</p>
<p>你！不聽得意阿雙方，都下了一個『總動員令』，大家準備着向東菲州開始進攻麽？這一回的戰事，和二十年前的第一次歐戰，多麽加進了許多的利器，現在統通要拿出來，像把阿比西尼亞做個戰塲，首先實騐一下；那一國勝，那一國敗，眼前雖然不能够預料，而『兵兇戰危』，這一句老古話，恐怕誰也不能否認：並且這一回戰爭，聽說：軍備上一切的一切，還是虛幌子那科學上秘密發明的，一旦在兩軍對壘拼命撕殺的當兒，哼！放出死光來，無論什麽堅城和防禦的建築，立時失效，就是上空的一羣戰鬭機，像飛蚊一樣，也要變爲烏有了，你！想這種打仗，不是世界上和人類遭了一個大刦麽？</p>
<p>可憐，和平！和平！喊了許多年數，被他一道『總動員令』，就此絕望。所以不定那一個國家，倘然是常常抱着息事寗人的態度，怕和敵人去戰，總是犯了怯弱的病症，不過歡喜起衅，甘心作戎首，自己認爲可無敵於天下，這一來，也不算眞正是『師出有名』的義戰；你！看從前拿翁左手抱了經，右手握了劍，到後雖是屢戰屢勝，稱雄一世，咦！他的結果，終拘囚在希利納島，試問他倒底博得勝利在那裏呢？</p>
<h3>蜜雪絲騷先其</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>本欄裏曾發表過一篇「蜜絲朱古力」，不料天下事無獨有偶的在某大學附近，却有一個「蜜雪絲騷先其」，譯其意，便是「臘腸夫人」。</p>
<p>在那大學的附近，共有三家小規模的番菜館，蜜雪絲騷先其，便是這三家小番菜館中某一家的老闆的太太。雖然這家小番菜館，和其他二家一樣的有店號，而且一樣的有搪瓷招牌，但大學生們，上這一家番菜館，總是說「上蜜雪絲騷先其家去。」</p>
<p>蜜雪絲騷先其，是老闆的續弦，只有二十一二歲光景。身材不高也不矮，不胖也不瘦。左頰上長着一個笑渦，右頰上長着臭虫大的那麽一顆灰色痣。於是大學生們都承認伊的笑渦，像某明星，伊的灰色痣，像某明星。</p>
<p>伊招待顧客眞周到，使顧客可以感到像在家中甩勝同樣的舒服。伊會說各種菜的英文名，更其是「騷先其」一字，說得純熟，於是遂成了「蜜雪絲騷先其」。</p>
<p>每餐，在「蜜雪絲騷先其」招待之下的顧客，總在一百人左右。因爲蜜雪絲騷先其的招待周到，小賬都給得很多。所以蜜雪絲騷先其也總是燙着髮，穿着髙跟鞋，挺糜登。</p>
<p>三家番菜館，蜜雪絲騷先其的最小，但那大學中的吃客的十之六七，都是伊的主顧，其餘二家，「减價」，「記賬」，「也用女招待」，但蜜雪絲騷先其的營業，一些兒都不受影響。</p>
<p>近來，在下午三四點鐘左右，大學生們，又流行着一個口號，——「上蜜雪絲騷先其家，喝牛奶咖啡去！」</p>

<p>第二十回　掙命看嬌孫抱頭落淚荒年憶往事種麥招殃</p>
<p>士廉這才搔搔頭髮，笑道；我有一件事很爲難。剛才我到這後門口去，看到一位老太婆，坐在對過門框下，快要死了。我想着，那就是賈先生那位新太太的奶奶罷。我看見了，自然要去吿訴他們才對。茶房笑道：那爲什麽不去吿訴呢，李士廉道：我又怕那新太太聽到了，心裏頭要不好過。茶房笑道：他心裏難過，讓賈先生去心疼他，李先生擔什麼心？茶房說着向前走，李士廉一把將他抓住，問道：你們這西安城裏，有借了害病訛人的沒有？茶房道？那裏來的過話？我沒有聽到說過。他不曾把話答復得完全，人巳經是走去了很遠。士廉一想，糟了，也到了前面去，一定把話吿訴　多才去。說不定老賈自己會到後面來看看的。朱家那個老太太，縱然是把死來訛我，有他孫女婿在當面，我也不怕他。而况茶房說了，西安城裏，並沒有　種事情的，如此想着，似乎還是到後門去看看爲妥。好在和對門還隔了一條街呢，他要訛我，也訛不上。如此想着，又轉身到後門口來。遠遠看到月英的母親和那胡嫂子，全在門框上坐着。那位老太太斜靠在兒媳婦身上，還微微的睜了眼睛，那是决計沒有死。他兒媳同胡嫂子正捧了一碗水，送給他喝。（三三四）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>尤其是我們的太后，日常老是很注意地修飾着伊的容貌，又很動緊地更換着伊的衣服，想來斷乎不會甘心讓伊的身體獨爲藏垢納汚之所的道理；但最初我竟猜不透伊的洗澡問題究竟是怎樣解决的。</p>
<p>現在先說我自己又是怎樣解决的呢？幸而太后特別的優待我們，雖是先進去的那幾位女官都是一起住在太后寢宮後的一座偏殿內的，六個人一起合住着，爲的是太后便於呼喚的緣故；可是我們進去的時候，太后便知道我們决不願意住得那樣擠的，因此不僅在宮內特地指定了兩間小屋子給我們，便是在頤和園內，我們也另有隔別的居處。有了這一重便利，我們便儘可自置浴具了，却也不能十分完備，我祗打發一個太監到我家裏去送了一封信；隔不到五六天工夫，我父親便托人給我們帶來了一只頗有幾分像西式浴缸的木盆，而且用的木料很輕，移動絕不費力，這樣就把我們姊妹倆的洗操問題解决了。</p>
<p>其次讓我再來吿訴你們太后的洗澡方法。</p>
<p>過了幾天，有一個晚上，突然有一位女官來知照我說：今晚太后又要洗操了，　後來我方始知道太后不但决非常年不洗操的人，而且是每隔幾天必須要洗一次澡的，正和伊每天晚上必須塗雞子淸和耐冬花露的一伴事相同，都是不會變更的刻板文章。—今天是正輪到我値班，所以我必須趕快上去服侍。（四三一）</p>

<h3>從邑廟到內園</h3>
<p>— 火雲明</p>
<p>凡是久居在上海的人，沒有一個不知道小東鬥內的城隍廟。知道城隍廟的人，也沒有一個不知道廟後的豫圓。生長在附近的，黎明去湖心亭或春風意樓喝茶，路上遇見熱人，問；「上那見去呀？」他的回答是：「　裏吃茶去！」把「園裏」兩字，代替「豫園」，幾乎已成了普通熟知的名稱。</p>
<p>髙等華人自有他們的逸園跑狗塲，回力球塲，以及琉璃地板的跳舞塲之類。。難道就不許一般的人溜向城隍廟來找覓貧弱的娛樂？黄铜戒子發出晶瑩的光，溸看不差眞金。，酒醲圓子飽嚼一碗，滋味不遜，國際皇家飯　和沙利文；倚在九曲闌于的紅花崗石上，悠悠地鑑賞濃碧波紋中的鳥龜，風情也不差華懋飯店高樓上凝眸思索的幽雅。然而這裏面還不舍有苦淚？而且在鋼骨水泥支　住的華麗的廟堂上，供有大明衣冠的神像，被身洒巴黎香水的女人和西裝挺漂亮的靑年　膜拜；這又不是民族敎育的一種反映嗎？然而人們批評城隍廟，以爲是民衆的遊散區域，天天召集着　蕩的一羣！從來不想到城隍廟中，除了烟　，閒食，膜拜，遊蕩之外，也有着學校，醫院，圖書館，公安局，以及管理邑廟和豫園的行政機關！人只見壞的一角，只咀咒鏡背的沒有光輝，却不願跑向　前，看一看城隍廟的眞神髓。只要看一看道路和衛生設備的如何，巳够太不公道！何況靈　的內園，巳經開放，繼着以大假山出名的萃　堂，也聽說將於陰歷重九日開始公開游覽了。</p>
<p>這裏，讓我先來說一說內園的故事，及其他。因爲最近瞧見有人描寫內園的文章，往往與萃秀堂的大假山併爲一談。詎不知萃秀堂稱「西園」，而內園稱「東園」也。考豫園本爲潘恭定尙書的私宅，上海縣志說，園基共有三十六畝八分九厘一毫。而喬鍾吳記裏，則稱「址約十七餘畝，南至廟寢，西北兩面繚以垣；東爲通　；中闢園門……」但由今看來，即使連小世界以西的舊校塲，以北的五老峯，（新北門街內）以東的安仁街，一起計算在內，也决不滿十七畝田地大，更不用說三十穴畝幾分幾厘了。而豫園燬後，仍有　地人就其原址，起建園林，在廟寢之東，謂之「東園」，康熙四十八年搆造，又名「內園」。向　錢莊業管理。大假山之「西園」，則起鑪於乾隆二十五年。內園之中　沼假石，安排得非常精緻。所疊假山，也比萃秀堂的玲瓏。從「別有天」的小　，向上左走，走完曲折的石梯，便有一個樓亭，位置在磚邱之上，可以在裏　品茶或下棋。要是有興「更上一層」，憑　可以低視城中的萬瓦人家。退出亭子，向南上去，是一排朱紅漆的長房，舒適幽靜。民國二十年間，上海市通志館，曾在那裏辦過公。本來從這一帶房子，可以通西南角的「小靈臺」，而今却閉肩不開，大約已被看守花園的人，做了燕寢？記得曹一士有詩：「赤氛黑祲年來有，憑仗登臺一掃除」，看看西川的匪類，東北的殘疆，無地哀號，眞是可憐得很。</p>
<p>內圜環垣，都鐫泥龍，龍頭直浸潭水裏，向傳龍有九頭，找得見的只有六七頭不定，其實是無稽的　言。園中最精雅的處所，就在大廰東偏的一凹長廊裏，恰恰抱着池　，礁堆上　出一叢翠竹，要是你能在微雨黄昏中，坐在那兒聽殘秋的細語，你一定懂得內園的美，與內園的靜。</p>

<h3>中國經濟改進之途徑</h3>
<p>— 俞寰澄</p>
<p>柳按：本文爲寰澄先生在復旦大夏兩大學講演稿。改進中國經濟之途徑，爲說不一。寰澄先生出其十餘年來之懷抱，發而爲文，主張寓工於農，自是非同凡響，海內學者得此一文，必增加一番研究興趣。惟以本刊篇幅有限，全文洋洋一萬數千言，一期所不能盡，餘當分期發表也。</p>
<p>一　幾年來的感想</p>
<p>今天所講的，是中國經濟應該用什麽方法來改進？不敢說改造，祇說改進，因爲改造必須澈體翻新，方纔當得起造字，改進是含有一部分一時期推進的意思；然而亦離不了一個改字。</p>
<p>雖說是改進，似乎穩和將就一點。不過這問題還是很重大，很複雜。鄙人今天所講的，自然算不得是一種學說，亦算不得是一種制度；不過就這幾年來見見聞聞，發生一種感想。懷抱這感想，差不多有十多年了，然而尙沒有組成一個系統，沒有收集各種材料，因此沒有將此感想寫成文章，並且亦沒有對人詳細講過。現在我國的經濟現象，一天不如一天，差不多已到了山窮水盡的境地。上上下下，高唱經濟改造的呼聲，一天髙似一天，大有不改不能過去之概。鄙人在此潮流中，自然亦不免想把十年來的感想披露出來，與諸位同學研究研究</p>
<p>鄙人的感想從何發端？大約距今十一二年前，往看大冶鐵礦的礦山，有幾百工人，在那裏挖取礦砂。鄙人問經理先生，」工人從何處招來？」經理先生還答我說：一這都是近處地段的農人，農忙時工人少，農隙時工人多；近處鄉村靠着鐵礦，亦獲得不少的利益。」鄙人感想到挖礦原來是農民一種副業。何以農民以外便無工人可招？何以農民沒有他種較好的副業而來挖礦？何以農忙時還要去做農功，而不肯把挖礦做一種專業？這是鄙人第一次發生了懷疑的感想。</p>
<p>約莫五六年前，有位王姓友人，是從中國開始辦麵粉廠時，就經營粉廠機器的。他吿訴我說；「這回從山東回來，山東的小麵粉廠，發達得不得了。從有了柴油引擎以後，幾千元或萬元，就可以辦一個小磨粉廠，當地的麥子，就在當地磨粉，買賣便利，省去轉運的費用，所以多能賺幾個。鄉村多有機器磨粉廠了。」鄙人當時感想到磨粉廠可在鄉村開辦，別的工廠何不可在鄉村開辦？鄉村磨粉可以改用小機器，別的農產副業及鄉村手工業，何不可以機械化？這是鄙人第二次發生了農工合一，鄉村工廠的感想。</p>
<p>最近三四年前，友人高踐四先民邀往無錫參觀民衆敎育院。見其改良農村，訓練公民，識字敎育以及販賣合作，辦得非常成績，鄙人又想到農民並非是頑固愚蠢，祇要有人提倡，有人敎練，就會一日千里的進步。可惜沒有工夫，到定縣到鄒平南召各處，改良農村的地方去參觀，可以多得到一點感想。這是鄙人第三次發生了農民大可有爲的感想。</p>
<p>綜合了這幾次感想，隨便參考了些報章書籍，便覺得中國的經濟，自有中國經濟的立塲。要改進中國經濟，自有一種明白坦蕩的途逕。自己想，自己問，自己答；最近兩三年，差不多自已有了一種具體方案的腹稿，就是今日所要講的，實在仍不過是一種感想。不過把前此感想，綜合了，稍爲提出一點頭緒來。</p>
<p>現在要入到正文了。我們要改進中國的經濟，必先明瞭中國經濟是何種對象？譬如醫生治病，必先識得是什麽病症？病人身體怎樣？然後方能開方用藥。不是抄個萬應靈方，可以隨便來一下的，亦不是老老小小，男男女女，强壯的，虛弱的，多可以用同一方劑去治。講到醫治中國經濟的方劑，實在是太多了！自由貿易，保護政策，重農主義，工業化主義，直到最摩登的統制經濟，計劃經濟，多可以說得頭頭是道。要說摸倣他國麽！英國以自由貿易而完成產業發展，德國以保護關稅而達到工業振興；美洲各國以利用外資而得到全國繫榮，歷史上已有了不少的先例。最近如蘇俄的五年計畫，意大利的協團組合，以至於丹麥的農村合作，英國的基而特運動，多有人稱道過，多有人主張過，到底是那一種好呢？倒弄得目迷五色，歧路亡羊，有茫然無所適從之概。各種學說，各國制度，我以爲都是好的，亦都是不好的。好與不好，就看牠與我國的對象合不合，合就是好，不合就是不好，假使沒有一種學說，一種制度，可以完完全全，如同印板式，摩臨來運用。我們還須斟酌去取，參合各種，或另出機秄來辦。所謂「運用之妙，在於一心，」不是描頭盡角，抄襲模倣，就會做得好，辦得了的。</p>
<p>講到我國經濟的對象，話就繁了。馬克思主義學者，紛紛爭論什麼時期？什麼階段？封建呀！前資本主義呀！資本主義呀！他們鬧了許久，亦還認不淸楚，我是門外漢，更其攪不淸楚了。現在姑且不用這種種籠統概括的名　，祇就事實上舉出幾種特著的現象，或者還比較容易淸楚些。我們祇就事實來講吧。</p>
<p>二　家族制度或宗法社會的經濟</p>
<p>事實之最顯著的，我國極大部分，亦可以說全部分，是家族制度的經濟；亦可以說是宗法社會的經濟。各處鄉村，大多是聚族而居，如某家村某家莊之類，到處皆是，就從上海來說，唐家閘顧家弄，亦尙有流傳的遺跡。聚挨而居的，其中繁盛大族，莫不建有宗祠，宗祠莫不定有祠規，最重是祖先祭祀，其次是賙濟同族；有義莊義學，及獎給名位的一族公共產業。家族就是中國人的人生中心點。就家族倫理上說，家族爲重，個人爲輕。就家族觀念上說，祇知有家，不知有國。照近世新學說講，這是封建的遺毒。然而全國大多數人民，尤其是農民，沉浸在家族愛河內，根深蒂固，不可驟拔，儘管幾個大都市內，高唱打倒舊禮敎，打破舊倫理；及幾次連番，有人奮勇來攻打孔家店，一打，兩打，三打，打之不已；事實上亦有父子母女，互相訴訟，似乎家族倫理，家族觀念，有點被新潮流摇動了。然而這不過幾個大都市的現狀；我們把幾個大都市人口，和全國人口來作一比較，就覺得新潮流搖動的力量，還不彀表面上極薄的一層皮。茲將各都市人口表列舉如下：（據廿四年申報年鑑）</p>
<p>南京巿　七二六、一三一　杭州巿　五五〇、九九〇</p>
<p>上海巿　三、四八〇、〇一八　靑島巿　四五一、一八四</p>
<p>北平巿　一、五一六、三七八　成都巿　四四〇、八五九</p>
<p>廣州巿　一、二二、五八三　重慶巿　二八一、二七一</p>
<p>天津巿　一、三九九、一四六　汕頭巿　二〇八、六〇八</p>
<p>漢口巿七七二、八三四　蕪戎巿　一五〇、四一一</p>
<p>長沙巿　四〇八、〇〇五</p>
<p>上列十三個市區，連市郊人口在内，尙不到一千二百萬人口，再加上南方的厦門福州，中部的寧波無錫蘇州揚州，北方的濟南太原張家口包頭等，工商業較盛之處，約莫三四百萬人口，總不過一千五六百萬。照全國人口四萬三千餘萬計算，尙不到百分之四，數量已經太微薄了，何况這幾上處工商較盛之都市，其中亦不過極少數新智識分子，及跅弛不覊之靑年男女，跳出家族窠臼，白行其是。倒有百分之八，九十分，仍舊過著家族生活，守着家族習慣；雖寄住都市中，毫未受著個人主義，國家主義，社會主義的影響。可以說全國整個兒，是在家挨的範圍内。所以經齊亦離不了家族制度的經濟。</p>
<p>家族制度的經濟現象是怎樣？前溪先生「中國新經濟政策」中，說得很明白。茲引述之：「歐美個人，對於國家觀念重，家族觀念輕；中國個人對於家族觀念重，國家觀念輕。而家族範圍，亦復大小不同。在歐美，個人財產之權利義務，關於家族者，大都限於妻子；在中國，個人財產之權利義務，關於家族者，直系親族，旁系親族，迺至戚友，舉莫不有一種法律的，習慣的，道德的，財產上權利義務之關係。（中略）歐美人在社會之地位，與中國人在社會之地位，迥然有別。歐美人在社會上，對於國家個人負責任；中國人在社會上，除對於國家個人外，別須負一種廣義的家族責任。綜社會全體言之：歐美社會構造之精神，在使全部分子爲有力者，而極力縮小其無力分子有在之範圍；中國社會構造之精神，在使全部分子有力者與無力者並存，而極力保存無力分子恃有力分子存在之習慣。故無論有業者與失業者，有產者與無產者，在歐美與在中國，其經濟環境，皆絕對不同。（中略）歐美之法律習慣，一以集富爲主；中國之法律習慣，一以均富爲主」這一段話，揭發中國幾千年沿傳之經濟眞相，眞是見其大，又　其微。較諸用對建兩字，抹殺一切者，不可同年而語。家族制度經濟的作用，全注重在任恤睦婣（見周禮。）老實說，就是有錢的人，要負賙濟窮親族的責任。前溪先生所以說均富爲主。不過雖是均富，祇均到有血統關係的人，而不是普及全社會；「親親而仁民，仁民而愛物，」（見孟子，）是有差等的。</p>
<p>家族制度的經濟，好處：在（一）减少大貧大富之差度。（二）使人民戀念其宗族鄉土，（三）使習俗淳厚，所謂一愼終追遠，民德歸厚，」（見論說。）壞處，在與各種新潮流不相容，尤其是資本主義。因資本主義重在個人能力發展，而且必要相當之能力，辦相當之事情。家族制度，旣牽制個人，又使其財產容易分散，而且當辦事用人之時，親族同鄉，緾繞不淸，往往使辦事人拖泥帶水，减少效率，某實業大王，事業甚大，然所用人員，非親即族。事務室中，談話爲淸一色的鄉音，結果不免失敗。此非某大王能力不及，迺是舊瓶裝新酒，家族制度，與資本主義不相容之故。通商大埠，提倡資本主義式的新工業，亦有好幾十年，結果沒有造成新資本，反把舊資本多賠上了。自然有其他種種重要原因，而家族制度，當然爲資本主義一位散瘟使者。</p>
<p>家族制度旣含有均富意味，「爲富不仁矣，爲仁不富矣！（見孟子）「哿矣富人！哀此窮獨，」（見詩經）富是從古以來，家族制度中道德觀念，所不甚謂然的。所以社會主義，還比較資本主義容易接近。不過集產式的社會主義，亦恐是不相容。我想溫情的，改良的，社會主義，用合作方法，把物質文明，化合融解到家族制度內去。生產與分配，同時注重，或許可能性較大一些。或能達到用力少而成功多，犧牲少而效率大的一條路徑。</p>
<p>三　重農的歷史性及占全國人口最大多數的農民困苦現象</p>
<p>「農爲本富，工商爲末富，」這是中國周秦以來，幾千年傳統之經濟思想。自后稷，周公，管仲，商鞅，賈誼，晁錯，一直到前淸的顧亭林，張楊園，一絲不亂的傳下來，沒有變動過。持異議的，祗是最少數，（如黄梨洲有皆本也之語，）在社會上毫無影響。皇帝及地方官吏，迎春時節，多要親耕，儀典極爲隆重，（比現在植樹節植樹，降重得多。）我們幼年時，常常聽到「耕讀傳家」一語，耕田與讀書，同爲髙尙的職業。直到現代，一般軍閥官僚，歸田尙是口頭上一句時髦話。中國文學，除掉無題詩（男女戀愛）應酬詩之外，大部分是田園文學，不是敷陳農民疾苦，就是歌詠田家樂趣。大槪歷來心理，以一國言，農是國家的本富；以個人言，農是最髙尙的生活。重農觀念，從有史到今日，未曾變更，或拋棄過。然而一方面儘管重農，不少典麗矞皇的文字；一方面，農民却極其困苦。至好不過穩度着最低生活。孟子所說「樂歲終身苦，凶年不免於死亡，」直到我們所看見的，仍然如此。不能不說是一件很矛盾的現象。近年兵匪迭乘，水旱間作，諸位從報章上，常常看到吞草根，咽樹皮，掘觀音粉，難民逃荒，全家自殺或餓死，種種事實，這都是號稱重農的國家，最大多數的農民，在不能生活的環境中，勉强生活。說起來，眞悲慘！眞苦痛！全國人民中，占着百分之八十二三分的農民，沉澱在如此慘苦的境遇，就使十幾個大都市，造成了黄金的天堂，神仙的樂土，於全國經濟補救得多少？大多數農民如此慘苦，少數工商業還能景氣麼？工製的物品，商運的貨物，呌誰去消費？誰來購買？講中國經濟的改進，不向最多數最慘苦的農民身上去想法，總是「牛頭不對馬嘴，」無一是處。</p>
<p>四　次殖民地的地位與新舊複雜的現象</p>
<p>先進各國經濟改進的辦法多得很。不過他們多取得他人的土地，供自己的殖民。我國則他人來殖民於我自己的土地。這一點緊要關頭，剛是相反。殖民與被殖民的國家，根本上經濟就大不相同。我們能把德國的保護政策，整個搬來使用麼？我們能如英國表面號稱自由貿易，暗地裏儘量朘削殖民地以自肥麼？我們能做到美洲各國自由吸收外資，以加增殖產麼？我們能效法現代多數國家，甚至最小自由市亦在行用的，管理滙兌，分配輸入等辦法麽？這也不能，那也不能，商約租界，束縛得我們動彈不動。加以强鄰壓迫，不平等條約之外，更有單面的協定；租界之外，更有强迫的非戰區。他人競築起關稅壁壘，我們偏要减稅；他人競保護自己工廠，我們偏使他人辦的工廠，勝過我們自己工廠。原來次殖民地位，駸駸快昇到全殖民地了。許多經濟以外的事情，使得經濟改進，無從下手，政治上打不倒帝國主義，經濟上祗得俛首聽其侵略。山窮水盡，何處去找一條出路？</p>
<p>次殖民地已使得經濟無路可走。另外還有一層困難：是我國處著過渡時期，幾千年以前的事事物物，與現代的事事物物，紛雜並陳。天上有飛機在那裏飛行，地上趕車的趕着那雙在　車，同孔子周游列國時，一車兩馬，還是一樣。社會上到處紛現着衝突不調和的現象。當各國初改機器時候，自然發生多少失業者。好在他們有殖民地及未開化之民族，發展銷路；故新興工業，勃然而起。失業者非但容易得業，而且生活格外優裕，衝突自然不會長久。我國太落後了，過去曾經一度發展的輕工業，扺制外貨則不足，打倒土貨則有餘。結果終於被外力打倒，將與土貨同歸於盡。我們看見都市的工廠，養活了幾千幾萬的工人，不知內地因之而失業，幷且失食者，又何止幾千幾萬入？簡單舉一件事來說。「男耕女織」，是我國家族經濟，農村經濟，幾千年流傳的慣例。從前鄉間，差不多家家有甘地式的手紡機，織布技術較勝，產布著名的地方，家有織機。自從機器紡織廠發達以後，先銷滅鄉間手紡機，再銷滅產布地方的織布機。祗有男耕，更無女織。鄉村婦女，無工可做。農村少了一大宗副業，我不奇怪；機器紡織之銷滅甘地式的紡機，我亦不奇怪。因爲國內即使不辦機器紡織，洋紗洋布，滔滔而來，亦是要銷滅土紡土織的。我最奇怪的，機器紡織，銷滅了土紡織，已有多年，而從來沒有人替鄉村婦女，另想法一種工作，代替紡織。我看到國貨與土貨之爭，（見去年華年週刊）眞感覺得徬徨無措。新工業與舊失業，如何可以兼顧？如說舊失業可以不顧麼！則失業者永遠失業，因爲新工業容不下這許多人。而且如此脆弱可憐的新工業，資本，機械，技術，管理，營運，都不如人，上不得政府之保護，下沒有同業的聯合。要同先進工業國去競爭，始終在搖搖不定之中，那裏還顧得到舊失業。失業者除了靠家族制度親挨賙恤之外，祗有兩條出路：餓死或是自殺！再要尋第三條出路，就免不了惹起社會的騷動。明末僅裁去驛卒，便造成闖寇之亂。何况加了十倍百倍於驊卒的人數？讀死洋書的，熱心工業化，總是說興新工業，必免不得舊失業；在此新舊過度時期，可以置諸不問，我實在沒有話，可以向這種人講，祗有請他們絕食幾天，一嘗餓鄉滋味，使他們曉得餓的難過，體會到失業而失食的人，會不會一心想出亂子。「痴子怕天坍，窮人望造反，」誰敢說今世定不至有闖寇之亂？當此新舊混雜的時候，這邊要顧到，那邊也要顧到。農本政策呀！工業化呀！不但別國的文章，抄來是艾不對題；就是我國固有的治法，亦不能完全適用！因爲如此縛手縛脚的，次殖民地地位，萬象並陳的新舊複雜現象，爲各國所未有，亦我國自古所未見。</p>
<p>五　幾種不可能的途徑</p>
<p>上面說過各種學說，各國制度，好與不好，就看牠與我國的對象合不合。換言之，不必問牠好不好，祗須看牠可能不可能。不可能的，我們無論費了怎樣大的心力，歸根還是一無結果。蹉跎復蹉跎，所謂維新，所謂革命，紛紛擾擾，已經過幾十年，經濟上尙找不到一條出路。「時乎時乎不待人！」我們不堪再走不可能的途逕。徒勞無功，我們應當引以爲鑒的。</p>
<p>第一，資本主義之不可能：上面講過家族制度，與資本主義不相容，此尙屬潛在的。資本主義之發達，有兩個要素：一是相當的國力，內可以保持安寗，外可以抵禦侵略，（兼武力與經濟而言；）一是殖民地，及供給榨取的未開化區域，可以取得廉價的原料，又可以擴張製成品的銷路。我們的國力怎樣？我們的殖民地及供我們榨取的區域在那裏？欲渡無舟，欲釣無綸，我不知道如何走上資本主義的途逕？要想做某某大王的，結果祇落得與瑞典火柴大王一樣。</p>
<p>第二，國家資本主義之不可能：把資本集中於國家，一切實業，都由國家去辦，生產消費，亦由國家支配；要做到這樣，首要權力絕對的集中，次要行政極好的效率。這兩件又是我們所缺少的。就使我們具備了這兩種條件，大都市横梗着租界，一切一切，都有太上勢力，在那裏操縱。資本未及集中於國家，早已逃之夭夭了，又何從辦起。</p>
<p>第三，協團集合之不可能：意大利的業團組織，的確！是在資本主義國家資本主義的中間，另創一種統制的局面。然而這亦要相當的國力，防當的人才。我們國力，旣無從談起；領導的人才，亦無從找覓。以前抵制某貨，運動某事的結果，是幾個極少數的人，裝滿了他們的荷包。所謂某會某會，操縱的，全是土豪劣紳的變相。大家疾首蹙額，受着竹扛的痛苦，絲毫沒有統制的效用。幸而中國沒有意大利法西斯帝，這樣强而有力，不然，這個「竹扛之敬」，人民更受不了。</p>
<p>上面說過：「家族制度本含着均富的意味，听以社會主義，還比較資本主義，容易接近，想用合作方法。把物質文明，化合融解到家族制度內去。」現在政府，不是很提創合作麼！可惜沒有認淸中國經濟的對象，「丈二和尙，摸不着頭腦」，而金融制度，沒有改好，得不到週轉的資本，行政效率又太差，所以還沒有多大成效。（未完）</p>

<h3>冷嘲與熱駡</h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>現在有許多不大喜讀駡人的文字，說那種不能算爲文學，這當然是一種偏見。但依我的意見說來，文學的形式不是只是一種，無論是謾罵，冷嘲，熱諷，或者是幽默，只要它是純熟的東西，一定是好的。不過要看你的思想是否成熟，嘲駡的對象是否正確。幽默也是偉大的，如果所寫的東西能像塞萬提司的古訶德那樣。謾罵則看你罵的是什麼，諷刺也看你諷刺的是什麽，如果像蕭伯納那樣諷刺英國的習俗，與貴族的醜惡，把他們嘲笑得體無完膚，這是可貴的；像屠格涅夫似的以暗示之筆嘲弄着那些虐待農奴的貴族，也是可貴的。他諷刺那些强迫女奴澈夜歌舞酗酒的貴族說：</p>
<p>『倘使她們露了一些倦意，他便自己用兩隻手捧住頭，歎息道：「啊！可憐的，可憐的我！人家不理我了……」於是那個馬夫用鞭子刺激那些女人。』</p>
<p>這種嘲弄的筆，寫得是多麼深刻，當我們讀到「用鞭子刺激那些女人時」，我們眞不覺得要笑，但實在是不能笑，這裏蘊蓄着絕大的悲哀，絕大的被壓迫的生之悲哀；同時在那方面，却極明顯的暴露出凶惡的，猙獰的醜臉，我們眞不能不忿怒了。我們的心裏，早已積滿了可以燃燒的東西，而他這一段文字，就像引火物，只要一讀他這篇文章，心裏的火，便立刻燃燒起來了。這種諷刺的東西不是好的嗎？</p>
<p>如果說文學的產物非要有情感才行，那麼冷嘲與熱駡的文字，也不是全無情感的，如我上面所舉的那個例，屠格湼夫倘若不是在極端忿怒的時候，也寫不出這樣的文章來。從這段裏，我們可以看出他的情感是極受壓迫的，但是越壓迫，情感也越深，於是便這樣寫出來；在外表面看是冷淡，而其實却蘊蓄着深原的情感。蕭伯納的冷嘲也像是經過一番忿怒的，表面看是可笑，而其却是極可令人思索，不是像那樣僅是可笑的簡直的問題。他的文章，隨處都有這種表現，我也不再舉例。</p>
<p>冷嘲與熱駡在文章的風格上面，似乎冷嘲比熱罵高一點，其實不然，這兩種是相同的，卽以人的性格而言，有的人是冷靜的，有的人是熱烈的，冷靜的人也不見得就比熱烈的人好。廚川白村便有一叚談冷嘲與熱駡的，他的意見很好，且把它抄在下面：</p>
<p>「說到嘲弄，起初就要想到冷，要想到顏色的蒼白。所謂譏誚，所謂諷刺，我想越冷越要增加譏誚味與痛快味罷。說到罵，起初就要想到熱，同時要聯想到怒髮衝冠，滿面朱濺的熱血熱性的人。迨熱度越過了沸騰點，在那裏就顯出來痛罵的痛快味，與增加着熱烈味。在前者是有理智的冷靜，有綽綽的餘裕。並且在其半面有不心意的伴有厭惡味。後者則是屬自熱烈的感情性來的，所以雖看有生來不改的穉氣與梗直，可是同時又恐怕不免有顚亂的狂態與不謹罷。前者可以說是如水如冰，又如利刃，而後者則是如火如熖，又如鐵槌罷。在前者又可看爲是有古典味，在後者有浪漫趣味的長處罷。」</p>
<p>他這段形容冷嘲與熱罵，正是我要說而沒有說出來的話。總而言之冷嘲與熱罵是不分軒輊的，這是文章的風格的不同，而不是品格的高下。文學是有寬容性的，表現的手法是可隨便的，無論是雜文也好，劇作也好，詩歌也好；幽默，冷嘲，熱罵……統統沒有關係，最主要的只在「意識」二字，你所嘲駡的是否大衆所痛惡的，你的對象是否正確，如果這種目的是對的，那，這文章便是偉大的，便有永久的價値。</p>
<p>我們不必排斥雜文，也不必專門崇拜小說，這僅是形式的問題，還有比形式更重要的「意識」，難道我們忘了嗎？</p>
<h3>歸化城</h3>
<p>— 袁塵影</p>
<p>—綏遠印象之一—</p>
<p>火車像蛇一樣似地，從橫臥在塞外大靑山中的鐵道上爬出來，長長的透了一口氣，在陰鬱的蒼松的大靑山脚下，最先露出臉來的是鐵道南二里半長的新城髙大的石頭城牆，城牆過去，便到達了綏遠車站了。</p>
<p>跳下火車，走出站外的時候，假如你是外路人的話，站上的賣小吃喝的又會想到：「看！今天北京的老爺小姐們又是考察來了。</p>
<p>從站上走下來。坐着乾癟手拉着的人力車。慢慢地走向城中去，走過了石子鋪的馬路。兩旁是髙大的楊樹，樹葉子拖下了寬大的影子。馬路上是靜悄悄的，你會想到：「好一個淸幽的所在呵」！</p>
<p>人力車走到那作爲天主敎勢力侵入這個偏僻的塞外的標記—洋大人行善的地方—公醫院的時候，新城的西城門樓在東面髙髙地樹中，像畫圖上仙人境地中的塔半隱半顯着，兩條向東南的「人」字的馬路在你面前擺開，人力車夫會掉過頭來問你：「到舊城去吧」？待你點了點頭，他便又有氣無力似地拉着你，向着南面蹣跚的走去了。</p>
<p>走到了馬路的南口，正是一條有四里長的從舊城到新城的東西大馬路，和到車站的馬路恰凑成了一個「丁」字，一拐灣，你便會看見綏遠毛織廠的大烟囱矗立在那裏，嘩隆嘩隆的機器響動聲在空氣播散着，馬路兩旁正在一排排的蓋房子，壓道車像笨重的牛似的，搖壓着大肚子咯，崩，咯崩來回壓道，路上的行人三三兩的走過去，悄悄地，像一些耗子似地，騎着自行車的人也只是像拉了一匹牛慢慢地駛過來駛過去。</p>
<p>快要走入舊城的時候，那裏有一座挺髙的大樓，那原來是什麽紀念堂，如今却要變爲什麽集會塲所了。</p>
<p>走進了城，髙低不平的馬路會顚得坐在車上的你透不過氣來，楊樹底下是排排的土房子，過了這便進了歸化城了，街上正在重新修築修過好幾次的馬路，打石子的苦力噢，海，海呀的聲音不斷地傳入你底耳裏，鋪石子的人撓起鍫來重重的鑒下去，石子星蹦起來，飛向你的身上來，猛然間會嚇你一跳的。</p>
<p>雖然公安局報營業稅的商店從七千家减少到三千家，但是，北門裏大街的商店却一家一家打倒了重蓋，展寬重蓋！路窄呵！汽車怎麽通過呢，於是，馬路寬了，於是……</p>
<p>一道二里長的大南街，街頭上擁擠着各樣人羣，穿着笨重袈裟的喇嘛，載着像大學博士帽的回人，最多的還是漢人，在大十字路口人却像螞蟻似地擠來擠去，這地方也應展寬了呵！然而—然而……</p>
<p>商店的留聲機，在播放着各種昔樂，嘩拉嘩拉的，和汽車聲人力車聲奏出了這沙漠中的都市交響曲，夜幕遮蓋了這塞外大地的時候，在那閃爍的電燈光下站得是不少的聽廣播收音機的人羣，可是商店的老　却在嘆息了！「只是聽！東西是賣不出去！呵！莊戶人（註一）爲什麽會這麽窮呢？………」慢慢地他也只好和那些聽衆一齊沉浸在那嘩拉嘩拉的晚間廣播樂聲中去了。</p>
<p>（計一）「莊戶人」爲塞外稱農人之語</p>
<h3>一匹馬的故事（上）</h3>
<p>— 林石</p>
<p>這一匹馬，因爲披着一身深　色的毛，所以牠的主人給牠取了一個漂亮名字，牠有了這一個漂亮的名字巳經好幾年了，因而牠生活在主人家裏也有了許多年。</p>
<p>一點也沒有寃枉牠，牠眞有一股傻勁兒。當牠還是年輕的時候，不必等着主人的皮鞭子打到屁股上來，牠可以一口氣跑上三四十里，不要休息一下。主人騎在牠的背上到處去收租，也騎着牠到處去打獵，而且有時候還要給太太小姐們挽車；差不多常是誇奬牠委實能跑。而牠一聽到這種議美的言詞，便尖着嗓子大聲長叫起來，發洩着心中說不出的快樂。</p>
<p>牠不僅是能跑，而且能吃。春天和夏天，不必說野外有的是肥草脹飽牠的大肚皮，到冬天牠主人偶然在切斷的乾稻草之外還給牠幾升穀吃的時候，牠也是髙興得大叫起來。</p>
<p>可是年輕力壯的時代早巳過去了。從前年起便出齊了牠全部的牙齒。這馬現在是年老了。</p>
<p>今天，從早晨起直到現在，牠還在嚙着那一桶乾稻草。有好些時候牠沒有嘗到穀的滋味了。稻草乾枯到如此之硬。像是嚼着許多鐵釘，刺得牠滿嘴作痛。牠想祇要主人肯將稻草用滾水泡热一下也是好的，然而就連這點也不能如願。</p>
<p>牠一面慢慢的嚼着稱草，一面審視着牠的周圍。太陽巳經爬得很髙。天上浮掛着片片綃薄的白雲。庭園的樹枝，不知從什麼時候起巳經出綠芽茁出了新葉。看來冬天是悄悄的過去了，春天芬香的氣息，又撒遍了人間。</p>
<p>許久，牠總算吃飽了肚皮。溫暖的太陽，晒在牠身上不覺暖烘烘的。牠渾身抖索了一下，冬天換過的脫落的毛便散在地下不少。牠似乎給太陽刺戟得很有精神。很久沒有呌過，想想便大呌一聲，呌得很熱而且很長。可是主人在屋裏聽見牠的呌聲，走到廊下遠遠的對牠笑駡道：</p>
<p>「嚇！這個老畜牲，你倒呌起來啦！」</p>
<p>主人在說這話的時候，他身邊跟着的那隻髙大的灰色的狗，也跟着主人吠了兩聲。</p>
<p>「老畜牲！」主人近年來常拿這句話來駡牠了。以前是歡天喜地的喊牠的名字的，而現在却開口便是老畜牲了。牠想到這裏，不免心頭忿忿的很不髙興。然而牠也很知道，自己也確實老了。不過牠又想；那隻野種狗也跟着主人吠我兩聲呢？牠配嗎？嚇！賤畜牲！狗，比起馬來就下賤得多。</p>
<p>不久，主人搬出鞍子和轡頭來說着：</p>
<p>「老畜牲，今天我帶你打獵去。」接上便將鞍子紮在牠背上，　頭的啣口鐵總緊緊的絡住牠的嘴巴。打獵，對於牠有過不少次經騐；在山林中，牠　着主人跑得很快。主人對準獐兎之類的野獸放槍，活生生的動物倒在地上，是淌着殷紅的鮮血。</p>
<p>現在又要打獵去了。果然，主人穿了輕快的短衣，背了槍。皮鞭子在牠眼前晃了幾下，便跨亦牠背上去了。猛然的身上加了百來斤的重量，牠的脚不覺軟了一下。早晨的太陽，晒得牠懶懶的，牠眞不願跑路，可是一想釗皮鞭子打來辣辣的痛得厲害，也就只得朝前奔跑了。</p>
<h3>柴米夫妻</h3>
<h3>銀臺山的黃昏</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>趁着夕照登上現在那改作伯先公園的銀臺山，晚夏的風已經帶着一絲絲凉意拂上我們的身體。夜色慢慢罩下了。伯先初下的一排排的流木陡然陰暗起來。</p>
<p>仰看天，藍色變灰了，一隻鳥，一隻，又一隻，我暗自地數着。走上山巔，房屋像鴿子或蜂房一樣排列在脚下。遠處一盞燈，兩盞燈，迷茫而孤零的小夜曲啊！</p>
<p>風越吹越大了。立刻我的心也飄浮起來。起初是！陣陣奇幻的浮思，接着連浮思也沒有了。我的心恬靜如三月的風。佛家說的無我執，無法執，也許就是這樣的吧？</p>
<p>衣裾給風吹得飄起，簌簌作響。連我的心肺也感到透底的澄澈。我把視綫移到極遠極遠處：隱約見到古代的蕪城和瓜州的月亮。究竟我是忘情於物，還是物忘情於我呢？我茫然。</p>
<p>茫然之極，發出一股原始人類常有的渾噩的興奮的快樂的情緒來，我跳，我用兩手狂舞。和我同來的人一齊都笑了。</p>
<p>我們從伯先祠向右折，有欹斜下去的士坡，約數丈路。路的盡頭，不能再上去，祇是些叢生的荊棘和土堆石塊。一步一步地朝下走，一抺胭脂的夕陽却和我們平頭了。美麗的落日啊！我該怎麽樣讚頌才對。</p>
<p>山的下面，一片都是些淹在水波裏面的田埂。粗看似乎不能識別那些便是出產稻麥的如雲的阡陌。現在，牠們一段在水裏，一段却在陸上。附近的房屋也都有一半浸入水中。我看到了那些，便聯帶地想起一幅幅的水災的流民圖來了。</p>
<p>飛鳥歸林，蟬聲已歇，慕色也漸漸深沈了。</p>
<p>走近伯先祠的廊下，看見那閎麗的建築浸漬在這黄昏的悽愴的氛圍裏，懷古之思混和着「大江東去，浪淘盡千古風流人物」的威慨，我憑弔伯先先生之外，更憑弔這一個謎似的人生。</p>
<p>電燈比來時加多了。一粒粒嵌在黑色的宇宙的帷幕上。我踏着銀臺的有名的「夕照」，走到公園的茶座裏。</p>
<h3>名譽老婆婆（三）</h3>
<p>— 江馬修作任鈞譯</p>
<p>在歸途中，就把臨時想到的戰爭時代的事情對她講了一回。動員的通知，出征兵士的歡送，新聞和號外的戰爭與勝利的報知，陣亡的熟人及其遺族的生活……等等在那裏，只有名譽兩個字。到處都是名譽。名譽的軍人，名譽的勝利，名譽的戰死……</p>
<p>接着，我就想起了那個久違了的名譽老婆婆。是的，曾經有過一個呌做名譽老婆婆的人。雖然如此，但實際上，在長期間，我却好像完全忘記了一般地，沒有把她想起來過。</p>
<p>我於是不能不把這奇妙的老婆婆的故事，對妻講述一番。</p>
<p>所謂名譽老婆婆，不　，說，乃是一個綽號。並且是在戰爭當時人們不知不覺她替她取的綽號。她本來呌做燒飯老婆婆，是我家裏的燒飯的老媽子。</p>
<p>燒飯老婆婆究竟自從什麼時候起來到我家裏的呢？關於這，我沒有確切的記憶。恐怕從很久以前就來了的，也許當我還是個小孩子的時候，她就巳經來了。時常總是不亁不爭地蓬亂着的頭髮，深陷而奇怪地閃亮着的眼睛，笑的時候光是露出紅色牙床的沒有牙齒的嘴巴，衰黄的臉色，還有那毫不介意的齷齪的裝扮—人們無論怎樣地看來，也會覺得她並不是一個普通老婆婆。實際上，我們也時常把她認做瘋人。自然，她也沒有另外說着或是幹着怎樣奇特的事情：但，不時總可以看見那些稍覺廳特的地方。因此，總覺得她不配當那須得清潔的燒飯老媽子。但是，她實在是一個很會做活的女人，一點也不偷懶，絲廠裏一百名女工跟別的許多用人的，炊　幾乎都是山她一手包辦的。因此，母親非常喜歡她。其餘的人們也各各對如懷着好感。</p>
<p>她在市梢那邊有着小小的貧乏的家業。還有丈夫跟一個名呌勇造的獨生子。她那兒子是個很能幹的年輕人，以　木匠爲業。當老婆婆談到勇造的時候，那雙奇異地閃亮着的眼睛就帶上一種難於說明的溫柔，衰黄的臉孔上面也顯出似乎多麽得意的光輝。尤其是當他在徵兵檢查時被認為甲種合格的當見，老婆婆更是十分自負。兒子被選為國家的軍人！她似乎覺得這簡直是貧家子弟的無上的榮達。並且，在這種歡悅和得意之前，她好像完全沒有想到：當操　者被弄到軍隊裏去了以後，家裏的生活將馬上發生困難之類的事情。</p>

<h3>中國本草之科學的研究（二）</h3>
<p>— 聶志晨　王銘鼎筆記</p>
<p>——藥學博士曾廣方先生講</p>
<p>在紀元三千年前，方技劉向立志研究天下的各種本草，他曾收集當時天下有名的本草書籍，統統都加以相當的整理，這工作可惜他並未完成就死了！後由他的兒子劉歆繼績努力，方克成功。</p>
<p>（二）煉金煉丹：是屬於道家方面的。與本草的起源，亦發生不可間離的關係。</p>
<p>（三）上面講過山海經中有不少的藥名，與本草的起原有重要的關連，可是這部書，究竟是那時代出版或什麽人著作的，都很有疑問，事實也就勿從察考，裏面所載的藥品，分有四種的使用方法，從之我們很可以知道當時使用方法的雛形，茲將山海經中藥品的分類和用法，記載之于后；</p>
<p>（一）內服有効的，計六十八種。內分：植物二十一種，動物四十七種。</p>
<p>（二）佩帶或內服有効者，計二十九種·內分：植物十七種，動物十種，鑛物二種。</p>
<p>（三）見而有吉凶之兆者，計五十二種·內中祗有動物，鑛植物俱無。</p>
<p>（四）有藥効和其他効用者，計五十五種·內分植物二十一種，動物三十種，鑛物四種·</p>
<p>這裏，我們審視山海經所講的四種有効品的使用方法：第一種的使用方法使藥物發生効力，是沒有疑問的；第二種的使用方法，而可以得著什麽効果，大概是當時沒有香水，遇着了不潔的氣味，須要佩帶這類有香氣的藥品來解闢穢臭的緣故；第三種是註明見而有吉凶之兆的，正足以映出當時鬼神醫藥的迷價色彩：第四種無從批評。</p>
<p>唐宋時本草</p>
<p>唐宋時代的文化，在中國歷史中，，佔了很光榮的一頁：而本草的歷史過程。亦以那時候爲主要時期。</p>
<p>唐顯慶四年的時候，蘇敬李勣兩人，感覺到陶弘景編著的神農本草經，失了時代性，有整理的必要，乃共出版唐新修本草。共有五十三卷，收載的本草共八百十四種。蘇李二人，那時都居在顯官的地位，我們閉目想想，專制時代的威赫官任，能够注重到民間的醫藥問題，而且對之加以相當的努力，可以說是在本草的歷史上，由民間事業轉變到官辦事業一大樞扭，開空前的新記錄；也就是現代衛生行政的先聲。到唐開元二十七年時，陳藏器又著了本草拾遺以補其不足。</p>
<p>宋代初時：劉翰馬忠著有開寳新詳定本草，凡二十卷，內容的材料，此較唐宋時代的本草書籍，豐富得多：和劉翰馬忠李昉王祐扈蒙堂禹錫蘇頌所著的開賓重定本草和嘉祐註本草三書，同是與本草最有關係的書籍。到宋元祐七年，四川名醫陳子承，對巳往各種本草書籍感覺不滿意，著重廣補註本草，共有二十三卷，內中曾有他自己使用本草所獲得之經騐的記載，宋大觀二年時，有唐愼微者，他爲人不好做官，但對于本草極富有研究興趣，著大觀本草，由當時朝廷出版。他又在政和六年的時候，同曹孝忠出版政和本草。此二書名雖然不同，但其內容是一樣的。同年冠宗奭將本草中無効果的藥物刪除，僅記載可以實用的藥物，著或本草衍義。</p>
<p>明清時本章</p>
<p>明洪武帝初年時，正値荒年，人民飢饉遍野，周憲王誠齊蒐集各種具有止飢功能的本草，著成了救荒本草問世。內容係以唐宋本草書籍爲參考而成。昔日高貴的王子，能够這樣體恤民艱，是値得令人景仰。後百餘年，李時珍以唐宋本草書籍及山海經爲嚆夭，又以大觀本草爲藍本，出版本草綱目。共有五十二卷，收載的藥數凡一千八百七十一種。</p>
<p>淸代時雖有各種足供本草研究的參考書出版，然沒有十分價値。在歷史上可留有痕跡的，厥爲吳其濬著的本草圖譜。吳氏曾搜集各地的本草，依其地質及氣候的不同生長出各種不同的形態。製成圖譜。其或匪異，足以令人欽佩！</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>

<p>（問）急性黄色肝萎縮症，病勢兇險嗎？</p>
<p>（答）非常危險。大都在發病後二三星期內死亡。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣治療？</p>
<p>（答）祇有注射胰島素，葡萄糖，或洒爾佛散等。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（六十六）　耳下腺炎</p>
<p>耳下腺炎又名腮腺炎。俗間稱爲炸腮脹。本病往往一時流行而爲一種流行病。或流佈一部地方而爲風土痛。多在春秋二季流行一時。冬夏二季則少。具有直接接觸傳染病的能力。所以往往一家均可先後發生本病。小兒及少年被染最多。乳兒及老人似有免疫性。故不多見。性的關係。則男多於女。牠的病原菌。現在尙未明瞭。牠的潛伏期。亦無一定。普通平均約爲二星期。發病的開始。多來輕度熱性病所有的一般症候。卽發中等度的熱度，疲倦，頭眩，頭痛，及輕微的口腔炎。經過一二日後。一側的耳下腺。於是發生腫脹。漸漸隆起。耳垂亦被牽舉。患者於咬筋部感覺疼痛緊張。所以開口，談話，咀嚼的時候。多訴困難及痛苦。若用手指試按腺體。則感柔軟。有時呈水腫狀。皮膚的表面。呈蒼白色。通常再經一二日後。他側的耳下腺。亦來炎症腫脹。此時兩腮膨隆。面呈異狀。因此俗問特稱之爲炸腮脹。本病若無合併症。則自七日至十日間。卽可全愈。合併症中最多者。當椎畢丸炎。此時睪丸脹痛頗著。在女子，則發乳房炎，卵巢炎，或陰道炎。</p>
<p>本病極少化膿危險。若有則爲續發傳染的關係。此時腫脹的皮膚。發生潮紅而有光澤。用手按之。則有灼熱感。牠的硬度。彷彿軟泥狀。下顎腺及舌下腺。大都亦來腫脹。</p>
<p>此外所謂續發性耳下腺炎者。多併發於數種重篤病症。尤以患傷寒時爲最多。此因口腔不潔。病毒從耳下腺營侵入的緣故。或由血流威受病毒而誘發。這種耳下腺炎的腫脹程度。火都劇烈。且多形成膿瘍。</p>
<p>本病的治療方法。非常簡單。在有熱的時期。務使安臥。耳下部施用冷罨法或冰罨法。塗布凡士林或橄欖油。藉以减少皮層的緊張。）我國俗間常用井底泥士塗敷局部謂有著效。實則無非取其凉爽而得緩解皮膚的緊張）口腔常宜淸潔。炎症劇烈的時候。則塗魚石脂軟膏。或用沙羅克斯燈照射。若起睪丸炎。則用提畢帶髙舉睪丸。陰囊部施用冷　法或冰罨法。至於續發性耳下腺炎巳成膿瘍的時候。卽當切開排膿。</p>

<h3>牙齒常識問答（四）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第十八問）乳牙什麼時候　脫落的？</p>
<p>（答）乳牙必等到小孩六歲的時候，永久牙中第一大臼牙長出來，方開始漸漸脫落。這個第一大臼牙，可算是永久牙的先鋒。牠出來了，其餘的永久牙，也就挨次出現，來替換乳牙。這個替換的時期，普通稱爲換牙期。</p>
<p>（第十九問）換牙期有多長？在這期中替換的程序怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）自六歲時永久第一大臼牙長出後，上述的五種乳牙，就大約每年要換一種。七歲左右換中門牙。八歲左右換側門牙。九歲左右換乳前臼牙十歲左右換乳後臼牙·十一二歲時換犬牙（但下顆犬牙較早一二年）。不過這是很約略的：各人和各個牙齒的換牙期，很有些出入；有的相差至二三年的（上述的都照實足年齡計算）。</p>
<p>（第二十問）乳牙要換的時候，發生什麽變化？</p>
<p>（答）在某個乳牙要換牙的時侯，因爲永久牙在牠底下生長頂撞，牠的牙脚，就會漸漸吸收縮短，幾至於無。因此牠就動搖得很。這是牠應該脫落自然的表示。在這個時候抜去，是很容易的；痛苦也少。</p>
<p>（第二一問）乳牙動搖的時候，如果不拔去，結果怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）若是乳牙發生動搖的時候，我們疏忽了這自然的暗示，或是順從子女怕痛的心理，不把牠抜去，牠過了幾個月，仍舊會回復牠的牢固。牠底下的永久牙，就要被阻礙，只得向旁邊斜出。結果，一生的牙齒，就要生得凹凸不齊。非但不美觀，而且刷牙時，難全部刷到，易藏汚物和徼菌，確是牙蛀的一大原因。</p>

<h3>肺結核淺說（六九）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第十二章　肺結核之治療</p>
<p>究竟何種氣候最適宜於本症患者呢？最重要的條件，當然係空氣淸凈與否了！此外，像溫度，氣壓，濕度，日光，風等也都不無關係的；對於塵埃煤烟衆多之地方，是最不適宜的。此溫度氣壓濕度日光及風等種種之差異，高山與海濱，夏季與冬季，俱絕對不同。卽患者各自的病勢，亦人人不同，故適應與否亦大有差異。但就一般而論，冬季則宜於海濱，夏季則宜於高山，自春至初夏，則以髙燥而少濕氣之平地爲宜。</p>
<p>關於高山療養一層，尋常一般人們，未免太過分迷信了，彷彿祇須一踐是地，所患卽可頓失似的；這當然是受了偏面的宣傳太甚的緣故。其實並不是每個肺結核患者都適應於入山療養的，甚至有時侯是害多利少的。像重症的喉結核，肺氣腫，腸結核，以及兼患腎臟，心臟病，糖尿病，等症；都屬禁忌之列的。此外若體溫增髙，超過三十八度半以上，脈頻數，每分鐘在一百以上，病灶浸潤面積過大，呼吸困難，心機衰弱，以及過度貧血，多愁易感之患者，也和入山療養是很不適宜的。此等現象有時係複雜異常，所以適應高山療養一層，一定須經過醫師嚴密診察方可决定的。</p>
<h3>止痛的醫學（三五）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>鴉片</p>
<p>鴉片出於罌粟。乾鴉片中約含一成嗎啡。科第印也是鴉片中的一分，海羅因是嗎啡的製品，怕怕非林與那科汀也是鴉片中較次的麻醉品，以上已詳述嗎啡的作用，嗎啡旣是鴉片中的要緊分子所以鴉片的作用也與嗎啡相同，鴉片的閉結作用速過於嗎啡，故鴉片在醫療上之最大用處就是止腹瀉，注意止腹瀉也當用得其道否則也與腹瀉無補，科第印麻醉性最輕，用於止咳與止痛。</p>
<p>海羅因之化學成分爲：C17　H17（C2H3　O2）2NO　HCI　H2O爲麻醉品中之性最烈者，其兇猛勝於洪水猛獸，其成癮易去癮最難，實亡國滅種的利器，國人萬勿嘗試。</p>
<p>麻醉癮</p>
<p>爲飢寒所迫人易挺而走險，爲疼痛所逼人人易入麻醉品之網羅，許多人是無辜的，他們有痛時被無知人的勸誘使他們嘗試鴉片，嗎啡，海羅因等。他們自己祗以一時麻醉止痛爲得意而不知後日的危險，意志薄弱的人特別容易上當，十日內常服用麻醉品就會成癮，若是連用二十日至三十日癮就根深蒂固了。</p>
<p>有痛的時候或有病的時候萬不要去麻醉品的求安慰，須知麻醉品不過麻醉，並不會醫病，疼痛有時是疾病很緊急須求正當的醫治方法以免性命危險，不應當去求麻醉品，用麻醉品治急症和一個人在急烈的火綫上沉睡一樣，縱不自知有危險但危險一定是更大，所以有痛有病唯一的善法是請正式醫師用正當的醫法解救。</p>
<p>戒烟戒毒</p>
<p>不管一個人有萬夫不當之勇，不管他是什麽英雄豪傑，他一有麻醉癮，他就變成了一個絕對馴良的麻醉品奴隸，爲什麽講他是絕對馴良的奴隸？因爲奴隸有時還可反抗主人，但麻醉品的奴隸則不然，他一生虔心誠意的服侍他的麻醉主，不敢有絲毫懈怠，並且一點也不敢反抗，人如甘心作奴隸則巳，如不欲則當下絕大决心與麻醉品宣戰，發奮自强是完全賴於這種精神。</p>
<p>麻醉品最大的威力不過是叫人於戒絕時，（一）覺到不安適，（二）神經錯亂，（三）憂鬱煩惱，（四）如飢如渴的求得麻醉品，（五）戰戰競競大有死亡將臨之勢。</p>
<p>用科學醫的方法戒烟戒毒可以講是沒有危險的，戒毒首宜下决心，戒時短期間雖稍有一些難過但一定可以得到最後的勝利，茲舉一例，一位有老癮的，烟量很大，癮已有近三十年，身體瘦弱不堪，他講他要戒烟癮，並且一定要用直接的戒法，不用代替品，他拿下了决心，經過了一些時的磨難，後來他居然戒絕了烟毒，此爲决心成功的明證。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>上海不景氣的深刻化</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>在市面不景氣的籠罩下，近日本市又有天濟藥房，源新昌綢布號，利永公司，及芳泉浴室等四大商家，因營業衰落，無法維持，而宜吿淸理。同時，聞地產業也甚形凋零，進出日少，有無人過問之慨。這情狀，充分表現出上海工商業前途，隱伏着嚴重的危機。</p>
<p>本市的繁榮，原是浮面的。儘管有人在大喊上海快要變成倫敦或紐約，但上海的疲敝，只有日見其甚。中小商家的此倒彼仆，已使市面漸呈不安。大公司大銀行的相繼關閉，更足以動搖整個的經濟局面。上列四大商家？天濟藥房開設迄今，已有二十年，源新昌綢布號，設立也已有十五年，均不免於一倒。營業之難維持，於此可見。至若地產業，向佔優越地位。在民國十八至二十年，爲全盛時代，較良地產，甲爭乙奪，繼漲增髙，自從逐漸降落，以至現在，更年不如年。從前値五十萬元者，目下僅及其半。這又是說明上海不景氣的驚心駭目。</p>
<p>上海往昔是繁榮的，今日爲什麼會一落千丈，陷於蕭條的境况呢？原因自然極多，但總說一句，是世界經濟恐慌的影響。此外，中國是一個次殖民地的國家，還受一種重大的壓迫，卽列强的榨取是。每年幾萬萬的入超，在平時已經我們無力担負。况在社會不景氣之秋，要希望農村不破產，都市不崩潰，這是可能的嗎？至今夏全國各省的大水災，尤足以令今後的上海，日趨於衰頹不振。</p>
<p>關於本市地產業的地價慘落，週轉呆滯，自美國提髙銀價，實行收買白銀政策以後，其情形益甚。因是不但地產金融兩業，皆戚困苦。卽一般經濟，也無不蒙莫大的影響。爲救濟此惡劣現象計，地產商曾一度决議發行地產流通劵五萬萬元，又籌劃設立地產交易所，聞未得相當的效果。最近上海銀行公會，錢業公會，及市商會等之團體，也聯名呈請行政院，另訂單行法規，以鼓勵地產的流通。其實邇來地產業的慘淡衰落。與其他百業，息息相關。在景氣不能挽回之前，工商業旣無從發達，地產業也難以獨榮。這道理是顯而易見的。本市的减租運動，便是根據此認識而發動。蓋減租直接可以復興工商業，簡接也可以救濟地產業。然話雖說得不錯，上海市面的繁榮，恐不是不久之將來的事。</p>
<h3>開學</h3>
<p>— 白兮</p>
<p>開學的那天，××私立小學校的校長，樂嗣同，換上了件褪了色的靑灰紡綢長衫，人們都會說：「樂先生換上了件新衣裳啦！」可是，在他的臉上，蒼白，憂慮，似乎比昨天，前天，更加深刻了。</p>
<p>早上七點鐘，還沒來一個小學生，老婆叫他喝粥，他就皺起眉頭來，哭喪着臉說：「怎末還沒一個小孩子來呀？」</p>
<p>他像條不斷耕種的老牛，從後門跑到前門，再從前門奔到後門。小學生總算來了，可是不多。「怎末辦哪？如果這學期學生不多，房金，債……啊啊！天！怎末辦哪？……」</p>
<p>一個熱鍋上的螞蟻那麽，他的全身焦燒起來了。聽見小學生說那個學生不來讀了的時候，猶如被誰打了一彈，正中着他的多憂慮而緊張的心裏。</p>
<p>終於到了行開學禮的時候了，鐘聲一饗，坐在一隻比較大的敎室裏，是寥寥無幾的小學生。這位校長先生面對着這些小學生，眞如一個囚犯，面對着斃他命的槍口。他並不說：「今天是開學的一天，……」第一句他就說：「爲什麽小朋友來得這麽少呢？」</p>
<p>於是池拿起上學期的點名薄來，他開始點起名來，把今天不來的，都做了個特別的記號。</p>
<p>「王祥生爲什麼不來呀？誰曉得」？聲音是哭着的。</p>
<p>立刻有一個小學生站起來，他說：「前幾天我遇見他的，問他來不來讀書，他說，不來了，因爲他們全家要搬回鄕下去了，只剩下他的爸爸在上海做生意。」</p>
<p>「哦，那麽，李善根有誰曉得不來讀呢？」</p>
<p>「李蕃根嗎？」又有一個小孩子站起</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>來：「他爸爸沒生意，讀不起書了！」</p>
<p>「朱志銘呢？」</p>
<p>「買夜報了！」</p>
<p>「王仙仙呢？」</p>
<p>「不來了！進識字夜校讀書了。不要學費的哩！」</p>
<p>以後，樂校長一定把所有不來的學生全問過的，然而他不記得回答他聽的是些什麽。他只看見收房租的賬房先生的陰險的臉，討債人的憤怒到極點的面孔。</p>
<p>也不像過去開學的時候那麽，自己說了些勸勉學生的訓辭後，再請幾個敎員也來那麽一套。今天，他把不來讀書的學生的根由都問過了後，就開始說：</p>
<p>「小朋友們！你們要盡力地介紹小朋友來，我有獎品的。」</p>
<p>就散了學。</p>
<p>這一天，樂校長一點東西也沒有進口，坐在算盤旁邊，撥了一天的算盤珠。他的眼睛看去似乎在發紅起來了。</p>
<h3>秋思曲</h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>病了。</p>
<p>患的是神經衰弱症。</p>
<p>衛生課的醫院裏的醫師說，要在一個長時期的休　之後，纔可復原。但，在事實上，我是不能有髙貴的人們所習慣的淸福：只能在下班之後，把公寓的院子當　療養院的花園。</p>
<p>（秋天呢）。</p>
<p>（艷麗的花凋殘了，樹葉子落盡了；季節是帶着丁香花樣的憂鬱味兒的。）</p>
<p>在半病的情態中，日子悠悠地唱着流水曲，像花朵的「朶緊追隨」朶地逝去。而且，有病的人是不能和健康的人們相比較，什麽事都感到懶然的，許多的時光都空擲在無聊的閑散裏通啦。時日多了，便有一種苦而澀的况味，常常在心坎裏像海潮般的湧起。</p>
<p>海洋裏的髙潮，偶而間也開過心田之春花的。</p>
<p>曾經有過這樣可笑的玩意兒。——出神地，倚着樓窗楞住了大半天。恍惚間，輕輕的閉上眼睛，心裏驟覺一陣酸，待睜開眼時，沒來由的，已是凝住了兩顆淚珠兒了。……</p>
<p>于是，我懂得了輕微的憂鬱是病人的唯一的慈母般的慰籍。</p>
<p>雖然秋天多可戀慕，但，它始終是不健康的呢。</p>
<p>健康的人是永遠不會感到憂鬱的秋天可愛的。</p>
<p>秋窗小記</p>
<p>小樓窗外有着一株梧桐樹，每當秋天的微寒溶和在黄昏的暮靄裏的時候，梧桐樹又　下頭，迷進沈睡的狀態了。</p>
<p>它是太孤獨呢。寂寞地綠蔭滿樹，寂寞地又落疏了葉。</p>
<p>——爲什麽它不開花嗄！</p>
<p>有時，有淸閑的嚮晚，我會用着唱輓歌似的幾乎是哭出來的心情，默念着。</p>
<p>因了這樣，我常喜歡倚着窗楞，把眼珠子跟着蒼空的雲朶而轉動。我喜歡會有一種落漠之感的情緒，使我覺得身體霎然間向着無底的深淵沈落下去似的</p>
<p>（這習慣决不是健康的，因爲沒有病的時候，决不會想起這些的。）</p>
<p>于是，又把眼珠子沒有實威的凝視着。同時幷想起些往事，舊日的桃紅色的夢境，火一樣灼熱的日子，年靑人所應有的興蹟。</p>
<p>往事是漫無頭緒的啦。正像秋的悄然地來，又悄然地一天一天的老下去。</p>
<p>是呵，秋深了。</p>
<p>季節病也加重了。</p>
<p>望着窗外那沈鬱的老梧桐樹，心裏問着得不到答語的問話。</p>
<p>——幾時纔能重溫那童年的野性的夢呢！</p>
<h3>海葬</h3>
<p>— 達</p>
<p>統艙里的老王硬僵僵地直躺在草蓆子上，瘦削的臉龐，一點沒有血色，黃的像臘製成般的可怕，眼珠子不斷地向上翻，露着骨骼的胸脯，微微地顫動着；嘴巴是張開的，很費力地抽着氣久同時，呈顯着急促的狀態。</p>
<p>統艙里蕩漾着難聞的汗酸的臭味，發霉的貨物的辛辣的味道。潮濕而又悶熱的空氣會使人們的腦袋漲大起來，昏暈着，呵呵地嘔吐出黃膽汁來。</p>
<p>「快去報吿船上的買辦呀，看來已是不中用了！……」圍繞若老王的身子，看他抽若最後的氣的人羣中的一個，擺蕩着腦袋，嚷着，彷彿推促着老王身邊的親人似的。「多麽可憐呵」！</p>
<p>然而，老王的身邊那有什麽親人呢他，他祗是孤單單的一個人！</p>
<p>「我給他報吿去。唉，死在船上，好慘呀！」人叢中有人應聲走出來，拖着腿跨上鐵梯，走到甲板上的買辦房去了。</p>
<p>老王是一個約莫五十多歲的人，灰白的頭髮巳經有點兒禿了，從他的嘴里那口黑黝黝的牙齒看起來，就可知道他是一個久住番邦的老番客。據和他同埠下來的一個搭客的口里的傳說，知道他一點點的來歷。他（老王）二十歲就離開家門，到番邦來找　　生活　　唐山」的家里有一個老婆和幾個兒子，一家幾口兒，每月的費用是要靠他的洋錢的。起初，憑着他那股牛般的蠻氣力，在恒豐廊（號）里做個「出棧」的落貨手，辛辛苦苦每月倒還有十幾塊錢寄回家，而且，約莫三四年的辰光總回歸「唐山」的家里去一趟，雖則生活不見得怎麽的闊綽，但也頗覺裕如，很受同鄕人的稱羨。可是，年歲畢竟一年一年地老下去，同時，氣力也一年不如一年了，從前二三百斤重的一包　」背在肩膀上，一點也不覺得費力，同事們時常打哈哈地稱讚他，「老王，眞好力道！」現在不消說是兩三百斤的東西負不起來，就是一兩百斤也已覺得有點不行了。所以，他這次由「唐山」回來，一方面因爲氣力沒有，再沒有人歡迎他；另一方面也因爲年來的市面蕭條，行情冷落，到處都呈着不景氣的狀態，一般的商店，爲要减輕店里日常的開銷，紛紛地在設法裁員，因此，老王也就失業了。</p>
<p>失業之後，家鄕里的妻子的生活的沒有着落，使他添多了許多苦愁，兼之，昔年的過度勞動，所得來的暗傷，火山似的都一齊爆發了，於是，他病倒了。等到病愈之後，終於由幾個舊朋友，大家凑集一些錢，資送他回歸「唐山」。當船離岸的兩天之後，還未過黑水的「七洲洋」，他的病可又發出來了。</p>
<p>老王的深陷的眼睛，已緩緩地閉合起來了，露着骨骼的胸脯，也停止了跳躍，靜靜地休息了。圍觀的人們，粒出一張淺黄色的紙，把他臘黄的臉龐遮蓋起來。</p>
<p>船上的買辦從鐵梯上走下來，後面還跟着兩個身上塗着煤屑的伙夫，噠噠的走到老王的屍體的面前，咆哮着。</p>
<p>「眞是倒霉，要死也可死在「山」（海上人稱陸上叫做山）上，濃包」！</p>
<p>隨後伙夫把王的屍身用蓆捲起來，蓆子上面再加上兩片沈重的鐵片，用繩子緊緊地綑着，抬到甲板上去了。這時，圍觀的人們像送葬似的跟在他的後面，每個人的臉孔，都現着悲傷的愁容。</p>
<p>「撲通」的伙夫把老王的屍體抛到海里，霎時間屍體給波浪呑噬去了。</p>
<h3>過渡</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>還鄉瑣記之一</p>
<p>當我走下渡船時，船已快開了，艙里滿滿地擠看十幾個人同幾挑空担子。他們看見了我是陌生人，就自重地排出一個位子來讓我坐下。</p>
<p>我的記憶並沒有褪色，小孩時侯上城或回家就是坐着這樣的渡船。早上從鄉里划到城裏來，當天下午就划回去。這回划船的是一位四十左右歲的老船戶，他赤裸着上身，啣着一支旱烟管，幽閑地坐在船頭吸着。</p>
<p>船開了。他用力撑了一竿，船兒就打了一轉，緩緩離岸，向中流駛去。渾濁的河水磨着船身，發出沙沙的聲音。船上的人好像都很熟識，一會這幾個攀談起來，一會又跟那些談起城里的事情了。只有我一人是孤獨的，我靜靜地聽着這稔熟的鄉音，心中不知怎的反而有點悵惘了。</p>
<p>帶着濕氣的江風從我後而吹過來，鼓漲了我們的衣衫，撫弄着搭客們的頭髮。坐在我旁邊的女人煩燥地說：</p>
<p>『厭死了，這鬼風！今年要是再上水，那就沒命了！』</p>
<p>這樣，搖船的老人就開口了：</p>
<p>『到城里見了他們吧？怎麽樣了呢？不會白跑了一趟吧？』</p>
<p>哎喲，不說了。富人的心就不是肉作的，是猪心，是狗心』她很很地說了，忽而望了我一眼，我慌忙低下頭，心裏暗自笑着他認錯了人。</p>
<p>『你想想，前年　兵災，他們連夜就跑到我，們　　　　　　　　　長。嬸娘短，喊得多親熱，祗嫌不够和氣，就是我又何曾虧待了她們。現在我們求人了啦，我們就要受人糟躂了啊，她就連看亦不看你『眼』。她一邊用手指着，一邊頓着足的說。因爲太於用力，連船亦擺動起來了。</p>
<p>她是一個中年婦人，有一對粗臂膀，臉孔早給陽光塗上一層咖啡色了。上衫滿佈着補釘說話的時候嘴角堆着白沫，在她身上實在找不出有什麽與男人不同的地方，她還把褲筒捲得很髙，跟故鄉的農人一模一樣。</p>
<p>我看見那位胸口陷下去的船戶搖着頭歎了一口氣，船裏登時都沉默起來，江風掠過耳朶，呼呼地叫着。</p>
<p>「那麼，借不到錢了，是不是？」船戶問。</p>
<p>「錢？你猜她怎麼說：現在生意不比昔時，要挪亦挪不動了。挪不動　她頭上戴的什麼，手上戴的什麼，手指上又戴的什麼，都是黄晃晃的金，說是窮了呀，你信不信！我還說十月冬到了，嫁了猪就還她，她只是推，只是推，說她沒權力下主意，這還不氣人？「個月三分利虧了她？有一天打雷時候這臭娼婦可要當心，提防天　把她轟死！」她還喃喃地唸着，船裏的人似乎都入神了，節到誰不担心？聽了這話，大家心頭都沉起　了。</p>
<p>船轉了灣，媽宮塔就巍然在望了。我不見這高塔已有十年，看着那倒影，那吻着堤岸的柔和的水波，照理我該溫溫童年的夢，但我的心亦一樣地沉重，我只呆呆地坐着出神。</p>
<p>「老三伯：渡錢現在不湊手，下次再給吧，」她又說了，聲音低了一點，又掀起衫角揩揩她額上的汗。由她身上我一定可以尋出十年來故鄉變異的綫索，可是這許是一個最老實的人吧，我這樣想。</p>
<p>太陽已斜西了，髙塔拖着一條長長的瘦瘦的影子，倒在廣垠的江面上，顫顫地動着。我想再過十分鐘，我便踏上了闊別十年的故鄕了，故鄉的風景想來依然，這髙塔，這水波一點亦沒有改變，然而人事呢，我的家呢？尤其是在現在這樣的時日裏，尤其是這窮得述八個銅板渡錢都付不起的誠實的農婦們給我這先聲，我的心那能不沉重呢？</p>
<h3>雨衣</h3>
<p>— 歸影</p>
<p>黄梅時節的天空，老是像一個患着歇司底里症的婦人一樣，喜怒無常。難得有一絲黄金色的陽光照到階前的時候，在你不留意之間，又扳起面孔，下起絲絲的雨片來。</p>
<p>「黃梅時節乍陰睛」他唸着這詩句的時候，不由地想起雨衣來了。他應該說是有雨　雨衣的；一　新雨衣付了定　沒有從衣服店裏拿出來，一襲舊雨衣在當裏已過了取贖的時頭。這樣，他蹀　在階前，對於一個極重要的宴會都不願意去赴約了。</p>
<p>像一頭鎖在鐵籠中的猴子一樣，他從廊的這端踱到那端，望着那愈下愈密的雨絲從天幷的士敏土上激濺起來，像繪書似的慢慢地將階前的一方石級都弄潮濕了。於是他讓進一些，卽在一排長窗之下踱着，但是雨點還是貪婪地侵略過來，有一點沒一點地巳灑上他的脚尖了。心彷彿懸在半空中一樣，他忘了在這方寸之地巳沒有他退讓的地位了，猛可間他的背脊碰着玻璃窗發出極大的震烈的聲音，把他從迷茫中喚了回來。天空下着排鎗似的雨點，自己的鞋尖已經濕了一半。</p>
<p>約會自然是堅决不去了，但是這黄梅不知要延長到什麽時候，雨衣自家是兩襲的，想起那件舊雨衣因爲沒有錢取贖而被當店吞沒，他是無論如何不甘心的。還是當初從大學裏畢業出來，幸運地馬上攫得了一個銀行位子，他以第一個月薪金購了那襲漂亮的雨衣。但是自那襲新雨衣買來之後，老天就沒有下過一次雨，每天是很旺的太陽，笑嬉嬉地。偶然有次半夜裏下着很大的雨，彷彿屋子都要塌下來似的，但下一天的早上，黄金的太陽皂曬到他的　前來了，天井的士敏土顯示着整潔的方塊，對街的屋宇，被整夜的雨水冲刷城堡似的在反射光下徘着齊到的瓦片，街心自然又揚起了迷人眼睛的塵灰。那襲新雨衣在他箱底裏積壓了幾個月，而第一次應用牠却就是送進長生庫去。當初因爲救急，雖然僅僅當得了原價三分之一，但預備有一筆錢到手的時候馬上可以贖回來的。不過他手裏始終沒有餘錢，加了兩次利息，還是過了頭被當店吞沒。更不幸的是降臨了一個雨季，像現在的黄梅時節一樣，每天飄着絲絲的雨片，好像要淸還先時一個請季，永遠沒有停止的樣子。於是他恨透了雨，一下雨就駡天，一邊下决心再弄到一筆錢來不顧一切地去買襲雨衣來；寗可餓幾天肚子也是願意的。終於他的决心實現了，他在一家最便宜的西服店裏定了一襲雨衣，付了定洋，約頭一星期可以取貨。在一星期之內，他下了最大的毅力保存着其餘補，我的欵子……那該是奇蹟了，他失業了，直到現在，那襲付了定洋的雨衣或許巳被店裏標了價出售了，他記得淸楚的，定單有一行顯明的字：「各種定衣，兩月不取，標價出售。」他計算着失業到現在是整整三個月。抬起頭來，天空像他的臉色一樣，陰沉沉地，玻璃窓上被雨珠迷糊了，能夠照見自己的打緊了　　的面孔。</p>

<p>昨天陰雨，未能工作，休息了一日，精神養足，所以今天大家都非常興奮，田方很早就起來唱「船夫曲」，方劉兩位小姐也都笑口常開。</p>
<p>工作開始了，大家赤着背，光着脚，背起了漁網，向那大海裏走去，保盧在前，小陳居中，老魏瞎着眼緊跟在他們的後頭，一聲口號，大家都喊破嗓子似的唱起「下網歌」來了。『拉呀！拉呀！」的慘聲，眞要呌人不忍欲聞了</p>
<p>無情的太陽，晒透了每一個人的背皮，黄豆大的汗珠，不住的奪膚而出，巨繩擦破了兩肩，分不出是血是汗，碎石蚌殼刺傷脚心，肉做成的人兒，睢又不頻頻地的呼痛呢？這種犧牲皮肉的工作，他們都能在王導演指揮之下，啜泣呑聲的忍受了，他們畢竟都是勇敢的戰士。</p>
<p>休息的時候，王導演安慰各位說：「你們這種犧牲，一生也不過就是這次拍「海葬」而巳，算不得什麽，要知道那般爲活命鬥爭的漁民，他們天天都是這樣的犧牲啊！他們的血汗都被潮水冲散了，他們的肉體，也不知道葬在海的何處了，我相信，你們這次爲拍戲而犧牲，不僅在劇的方面增加了眞實的「力」，同時在你們自身的人生體騐上，更多着一個敎訓啊，你們知道，你們今天起真眞知道了漁民的苦痛了！」大家似乎接受王導演的安慰，在苦笑中漸漸現出勝利的微笑了，正是：</p>

<h3>A-Army Fights Bravely for Three Days and Nights: A-Duwa Falls, a Decisive Victory. Italian Army Concentrates Large Forces for Continued Advance; A-Country Strengthens Eastern Line of Defense.</h3>
<p>A-Jing: After three days and nights of siege by the Italian army, A-Duwa city is said to have fallen (Havas dispatch, 6th).</p>
<p>A-Si-Ma-La: A dispatch from the Italian front reports that the Italian army has captured A-Duwa town (Reuters dispatch, 6th).</p>
<p>A-Si-Ma-La: After extremely fierce fighting near A-Duwa in the past forty-eight hours, the Italian army has today captured the ancient city of A-Duwa (Reuters dispatch, 6th).</p>
<p>(Rome) While the Italian army's war report from A-Si-Ma-La, Eritrea, claims that A-Duwa has already fallen, the official Roman bulletin on the progress of the Abyssinian war does not mention this. According to the bulletin, the first legion commanded by General Santini has raised the Italian flag at the ruins of the old fort of A-Di-La-Te, north of A-Duwa. Residents and clergy have surrendered. The second legion has reached the edge of the A-Duwa valley and continues to advance this morning. The Italian army in the southeast has occupied Jie-Luo-Gu-Bi town after a brief battle (Reuters dispatch, 6th).</p>
<p>A-Jing: According to news received here, the Italian army concentrated a large part of its forces to besiege A-Duwa city for three days and nights, but the city has not yet fallen. Last night, the Italian and A-armies engaged in close combat in the Tang-Na-Kai area southeast of A-Duwa city, with hundreds of Italian soldiers killed. 15,000 A-country regular troops have rushed from the capital to the vicinity of A-Duwa to reinforce General Sai-Xiong, the governor of Tigre province, who is defending the area. However, it is feared that it may be too late, and A-She-Hua city will ultimately be indefensible. It is rumored that the A-army has infiltrated Italian-controlled Eritrea, cutting off the Italian army's rear transportation. Furthermore, the Italian army on the southern front is advancing on the Wo-Jia-Deng area from Italian Somaliland. The A-army stationed in Ha-La-Er has now been fully deployed to the nearby border area of Qi-Qi-Jia (Jijiga) to block them (Havas dispatch, 5th).</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers report frontline news stating that the A-army is currently using guerrilla tactics to impede the Italian army's advance north of A-Duwa. The Italian army is now changing tactics, planning to gather tanks and aircraft to attack A-Duwa from the rear along the A-Duwa to A-Ji-Mu (Akim) road. Although the Italian army encountered fierce resistance in Mei-Ba-Li-Ya (Maibaria), they have occupied several small mountains, from which they are shelling A-Duwa, ten miles away.</p>
<p>A-Jing: Ten thousand A-army soldiers have been ordered to defend Mount Mu-Sa-A-Li in the northeastern corner of A-country at all costs, because the A-king has declared that if the area falls, the railway between Djibouti and A-Jing will be cut off. Italian aircraft bombed the towns of A-Duwa and A-Di-Ge-La, causing little bloodshed, because the residents of the towns had all fled to the surrounding countryside before the war began. At 4 PM today, the authorities issued a statement stating that Italian troops had occupied our outposts in Hua-Qi-La (Wagela) and An-Ju-La (Enguela), suffering heavy casualties. Italian troops have advanced to within a few miles of A-Di-Ge-La, which is still being defended by our troops (Reuters dispatch, 5th).</p>
<p>A-Jing: The A-government tonight admitted that the Italian army is advancing gradually along three routes: east, south, and north. However, the main battle has not yet begun. The A-army's purpose in defending the border is not to stop the Italian advance, but rather to intercept them in various sections. Rumors that the A-army suffered 1,500 casualties in the battle of A-Duwa have been denied here. The A-emperor is now awaiting Italian air strikes on the capital, as the Italian army on the eastern and southern fronts are both advancing towards the railway line. After they converge, it is quite possible that they will immediately build an air force base (National Telegram, 5th).</p>
<h3>Rome Announces War Report: Northern Army Advances One Hundred Miles; Mussolini's Son-in-Law Narrowly Escapes Disaster</h3>
<p>(Rome) An official bulletin was issued here this afternoon, for the first time officially acknowledging that the Italian army has invaded Abyssinia from Somaliland. It states that the Italian army has occupied Dolo, near the northeastern border of Kenya. Italian aircraft bombed Gorahai, about 100 miles northwest, located within Abyssinian territory. At the same time, according to the "Jiang Tan Bao", the A-government has begun to inspect wireless telegrams sent from A-Jing. It also states that a large batch of British-made munitions is being transported from the port of Jira in British Somaliland into A-country to supply the garrison of Ha-La-Er (Reuters dispatch, 5th).</p>
<p>(Rome) A frontline war report received here today states that Count Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law (formerly the Italian ambassador to China), narrowly escaped disaster. While flying over A-territory in his plane, it was struck by several bullets and damaged. However, the Count escaped injury and safely flew back to Asmara in Italian Somaliland. It is noted that Count Ciano commanded the air force that launched a fierce attack on A-Duwa when the Italian army launched its offensive against A on October 3rd (Reuters dispatch, 5th).</p>
<h3>The Mighty Italian Army Launches Three-Pronged Attack: A-Army Employs Strategy of Luring the Enemy Deep; Fighting Bravely with Four Against Ten</h3>
<p>A-Jing: This area recently received a report from General Sai-Xiong, the governor of Tigre province, stating that the Italian army occupied the two defense camps of Wa-Jie-Da (Waheta) and An-Ge-La (Enguela) at 4 PM yesterday (south of A-Duwa city). Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Four Italian officers were killed on the spot. Our army also captured two machine guns and two rifles. Italian aircraft carried out bombings near the city of A-Di-Ge-La, killing many women and children. The regiment has now advanced to Bietharpariat (about one and a half hours walk from the city of A-Di-Ge-La). The country's planes fly back and forth over the place. As for the claim that an Italian plane was shot down by the A-army yesterday, the A-government has not verified it. According to a communiqué issued here, the Italian army on the northern route has advanced 100 kilometers, aiming to encircle the cities of A-Duwa, A-Ke-Sen (Aksum), and Bing, and capture them in one fell swoop. As for the A-army, its main force has not yet joined the war. The strategy adopted is to avoid direct conflict with the Italian army and lure the enemy deep into a suitable location, before launching a counter-offensive. The famous A-general, General Jia-Sa, originally led a large force stationed in the mountainous area around Gong-Da-Er city (southwest of A-Duwa city) and is now preparing to rush to A-Duwa city to support General Sai-Xiong. The Italian army is currently launching attacks along three routes: one is the northern route, starting north of the Da-Bu-Si River (Takkaxe) in Tigre province, heading directly for A-Duwa city; one is the middle route, advancing eastward towards Wo-Sa-You (Aussa), Ha-Tai-Er-Ju-Bo city (Hadelegubo, close to French Somaliland); and one is the southern route, starting from Italian Somaliland, now advancing southeast towards the Wo-Jia-Deng (Ogaden) area and Jie-Luo-Gu-Bi city. At present, the Italian armies on all routes have only made contact with the A-army's outposts, and the main battle has not yet occurred. As for the Italian aircraft bombing A-Duwa city, the number of casualties included 40 women and 32 children. When the Italian and A-armies fought in the cities of A-Duwa and A-Ke-Sen, the A-army's strength was only 400 men, yet they were able to resist 1,000 Italian soldiers. It is reported that 45 A-soldiers were killed, while 21 Italian soldiers were killed, and 65 were captured. In addition, the Italian troops concentrated on Mount Mu-Sa-Li-Ya (that is, the place where the Italian army first invaded A-territory) numbered 30,000 men, with 70 tanks and 100 aircraft (Havas dispatch, 5th).</p>
<h3>Northern Front War Situation</h3>
<p>A-Duwa Under Encirclement - A-Si-Ma-La City</p>
<p>Our special correspondent declares that the three columns of Italian troops starting from Eritrea reached their destination yesterday. (1) The Sandini column has occupied the city of A-Di-Ge-La in A-country. (2) The Bier-Qi-Wo-Ci-Luo-Li column has occupied An-De-Suo-Yi-Wo (Entisoiu). (3) The Ma-La-Wei-Ge-Na column has arrived near A-Duwa city and is expected to occupy the city in a few hours. The Italian army has not yet encountered strong resistance. As for the A-Jing's report that an Italian plane was shot down, officials here have denied it (Havas dispatch, 6th).</p>
<p>Nine Columns Advance - A-Si-Ma-La</p>
<p>Our visiting reporter declares that Italian aircraft on the northern route reconnoitered this morning and discovered two large columns of A-army troops advancing towards the front line, about ten kilometers from the Italian army. As for the Italian consul in A-Duwa city, Fu-Lang-Jia, who had previously received instructions to leave his post, before the consul could comply, he was arrested by the A-authorities. The headquarters here have not received any news about his whereabouts. At present, nine columns of Italian troops are advancing on different routes. The division commanded by General Ma-La-Wei-Ge-Na is on the right wing, with colonial native troops in the center, and the Italian army headquarters troops commanded by General Sandini on the left wing, guided by native troops, in order to harmonize with the people along the way. In short, the large Italian army is concentrating between the cities of A-Di-Ge-La and A-Duwa, carrying tanks to assist in the battle, and with engineers accompanying them to immediately build roads after the main army advances, in order to facilitate rear transportation. The air force is serving as liaison between the various columns. The area through which the Italian army's right wing passes is mostly hilly, with many civilian houses on the hills. The A-army is hiding in them, fiercely resisting, and thus fierce fighting has broken out between the two sides. However, the right-wing commander, General Ma-La-Wei-Ge-Na, still defeated the A-soldiers and advanced to the vicinity of A-Duwa city (Havas dispatch, 5th).</p>
<p>A-Jing: The government has just declared that the Italian air force bombed Sai-Ke-Tai city, which is 160 kilometers south of A-Duwa city, has a population of 15,000, and is an important city. The government has just approved the dispatch of 150 French colonial army personnel to Di-Lai-Da-Hua city (Diredawa) along the railway (north of Ha-La-Er city) to protect railway staff (Havas dispatch, 6th).</p>
<p>30,000 Italian Troops Continue to Reinforce (Rome) It is reported that approximately 35,000 Italian troops are currently en route in the Red Sea, intending to go to Italian Eritrea. The port facilities at Masua are now being greatly improved, with the capacity to disembark 3,000 soldiers and 3,000 tons of munitions daily (Havas dispatch, 5th).</p>
<p>Disseminated Leaflets Advise Indigenous People (Rome) It is reported that Italian aircraft are distributing leaflets in northern A-country, advising the indigenous people to surrender to Italy, saying that the Italian army is extremely powerful and will mercilessly punish anyone who dares to resist. It also said, "Before the A-emperor destroyed the territory of Emperor Xu-An of Tigre, Italy should now restore the Xu-An dynasty to its original position. The A-government is making a big mistake by forbidding you from selling goods to Eritrea. If the Amhara people (the central ethnic group of A-country) invade Tigre province, they will plunder your livestock and goods. Only the Italians can benefit you, because the Italians are loved by God," (Havas dispatch, 5th).</p>
<h3>Eastern Front War Situation</h3>
<p>Tai-Xi City Suffers Tragic Bombing - A-Jing: It is rumored that Italian aircraft bombed Dessie city, 250 kilometers north of the capital, but the details are unknown. The A-army declares that it captured 40 Italian soldiers in the Tang-Na-Kai area on the northern border. Also, trains departing from the capital are fully loaded with military supplies destined for Ha-La-Er. The governor of Arussi province, Ma-Li-An, arrived here tonight to receive instructions from the A-emperor. The governor of Wallega province in western A-country, Mai-Ge-Nan, will soon pass through the capital leading troops to the north to fight (Havas dispatch, 5th).</p>
<h3>Southern Front War Situation</h3>
<p>Hua-Er-Hua-Er Announces Recapture - A-Jing: A visiting reporter received news from the southern front that the A-army in the Wo-Jia-Deng area had besieged Hua-Er-Hua-Er and recaptured the place. It is noted that Hua-Er-Hua-Er has been occupied by Italy since December of last year. This Italian-A conflict also started with this as the starting point (Haswa dispatch, 6th).</p>
<h3>Italian Nationals Overseas Return to Country to Enlist in Military</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian citizens residing in Thessaloniki and Piraeus, Greece, have returned to their country to join the army. They have recently arrived in Brindisi and were warmly welcomed by local government officials and people. In addition, hundreds of volunteer soldiers from Italian communities in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay in South America are now on their way back to the country. All volunteer soldiers returning from abroad are currently undergoing centralized training in the city of Sabadia, numbering 4,000. They have formed an overseas community corps, commanded by Balini, the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Association. The training will be completed within two months. It is noted that Sapodia is a newly built city under the Fascist regime (Havas, 6th).</p>
<h3>Geneva Takes a Sharp Turn: Which is the Aggressor Nation Needs to be Determined Urgently; League of Nations Forms Six-Person Committee to Research; Voices for Sanctions Against Italy</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At an important meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council today, A representative Ha-Hua-Li-Te formally stated that he was seeking to adopt the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant against Italy. The Administrative Council considered the report of the Thirteen-Person Committee, but has not yet passed it, because the representatives of both Italy and A have just received the original text of the report and need to seek instructions from their home governments. The Administrative Council designated the representatives of England, France, Spain, Romania, Portugal, and Chile to form a Six-Person Committee to study the situation based on the reports of the disputing countries and to determine which is the aggressor nation. It is expected that the Six-Person Committee will be able to decide on this point on Sunday. After the aggressor nation is determined, the League of Nations can take the second step, which is to consider sanctions. People in Geneva generally believe that the current situation will inevitably move towards the adoption of sanctions, which is truly an unprecedented event in the history of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to meet at 4 PM on Wednesday, at which time the first step regarding sanctions may be taken. The British representative Eden advocated that the newly organized Six-Person Committee should immediately start work. This proposal has now been realized, which shows that the Administrative Council has decided not to delay any longer. The Six-Person Committee met for an hour tonight and elected the Portuguese representative Monteiro as chairman, and decided to meet again tomorrow afternoon. At the same time, it instructed the Secretariat to prepare a complete file of all documents regarding the case (Reuters dispatch, 5th).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations began today to confirm Italy as the instigator of the war against A-country, which is a prelude to the implementation of sanctions. The League of Nations Administrative Council tonight separately nominated the six countries of England, France, Russia, Portugal, Denmark, and Chile to form a drafting committee to produce another report, which is to be submitted to the Administrative Council for formal discussion on Monday. The League of Nations General Assembly has also decided to meet on Wednesday. Geneva is experiencing a sharp turn of events (National Telegram, 5th).</p>
<p>(Geneva) Whether or not sanctions will be implemented is no longer a question. However, what kind of sanctions should be adopted remains to be decided. The report of the Six-Person Committee designated by the League of Nations Administrative Council yesterday to study the new situation and determine which is the aggressor nation will inevitably lead to a ruling that Italy has violated Articles 10, 12, and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. This is undoubtedly certain. It is expected that this report will be unanimously passed by the Administrative Council, and then it will be transferred to the League of Nations General Assembly, which will convene at 4 PM on Wednesday to establish a committee to decide what kind of sanctions can be implemented in the current situation (Reuters dispatch, 6th).</p>
<h3>Administrative Council Meeting Held the Day Before Yesterday: Atmosphere Extremely Tense; Eleven Committees Submit Reports; League of Nations General Assembly Convened on Wednesday</h3>
<p>(Geneva) When the Administrative Council met at 6 PM tonight to accept the report of the Thirteen-Person Committee, the meeting hall was crowded and the atmosphere was extremely tense. The severity of the situation could be seen on everyone's faces. The Italian representative Aroccios and the A representative Ha-Hua-Li-Te sat facing each other at the horseshoe-shaped table (Reuters dispatch, 5th).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council met this afternoon, first holding a closed-door meeting attended by the representatives of thirteen countries, including England, France, the Soviet Union, Romania, Argentina, Equatorial Guinea, Chile, Spain, Australia, Poland, and Denmark. The Italian representative Aroccios and the Abyssinian representative Ha-Hua-Li-Te waited in the adjacent room in the meeting hall. At 6 PM, a public meeting was held, and the Italian and A representatives attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Italian Representative Vigorously Defends Himself</p>
<p>First, the Italian representative Aroccios read a lengthy speech, stating briefly that the Italian government regretted that the League of Nations Administrative Council was unwilling to examine the situation from a practical point of view. The Italian government believed that if it did not understand the actual situation in Abyssinia after years of continuous harassment of Italy by the A-country, and only made a superficial judgment, it would inevitably misidentify the aggressor as the aggressed. As for the hostility of some foreign public opinion towards Italy, it was for other reasons and had nothing to do with the Italian-A conflict. This Italian military action was a response to the A-country's mobilization (Havas dispatch, 5th). Finally, he said that the Italian government deeply appreciated the efforts of the Administrative Council, but the League of Nations had already understood and hoped that the first thing to be considered was that Abyssinia was not qualified to join the League of Nations (Reuters dispatch, 5th).</p>
<h3>A Representative Requests Sanctions</h3>
<p>Next, the A representative Ha-Hua-Li-Te read the note from the Abyssinian government to the League of Nations, which was issued this afternoon (see separate telegram), and said that although the A-country had been repeatedly subjected to Italian military threats, the A-country's mobilization order was delayed until the last minute before it was issued. The A-country now requested that the League of Nations Administrative Council take the procedures described in Article 16 of the Covenant and immediately order the Italian government to cease military action. Thereupon, the chairman of the Administrative Council, the Argentine representative Qi-Na-Ge, declared that the Administrative Council would continue to meet next Sunday to vote on the Administrative Council's report on the Italian-A dispute. The Administrative Council adjourned at 6:45 PM. It was also heard that at today's closed-door meeting of the Administrative Council, based on the recommendation of the Thirteen-Nation Committee, it was decided to convene the League of Nations General Assembly next Wednesday to order a determination of who was at fault. After the League of Nations determined the aggressor country, a drafting committee would be established to draft a sanctions plan. Also, at today's meeting of the Administrative Council, the representatives of the six countries of England, France, the Soviet Union, Portugal, Chile, and Denmark were entrusted to prepare the report of the Administrative Council based on the report prepared by the Thirteen-Nation Committee (see separate telegram) and submit it for voting at the meeting next Sunday (Havas dispatch, 5th).</p>
<h3>Report of the Thirteen-Nation Committee: The Internal Situation in A-country is Now Different From Before; Proving the Inappropriateness of Italian Actions</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee today submitted a report to the League of Nations Administrative Council on the origin and course of the Italian-A dispute. The report described in detail the past and present situation of the relations between Italy and A-country. It was particularly interesting to analyze the memorandum submitted by Italy to the League of Nations on September 4th and the A-country's reply. It briefly stated that Italy's memorandum expressed dissatisfaction with the A-country in three points: (1) The Italian border in East Africa was not secure; (2) The A-country did not fulfill the obligations it assumed when it joined the League of Nations; and (3) Internal disturbances in A-country were not stable. Subsequently, the A-country government sent a note to the League of Nations on September 14, proposing that the League of Nations send a survey team to the local area to investigate the points that Italy considered unsatisfactory. However, the Thirteen-Nation Committee regretted that it was unable to send a survey team to the area in the current situation. As for the Italian memorandum's claim that the Italian border was not secure, the report pointed out that the East African territories of England and France, which were connected to the border of the A-country, were also frequently violated and incidents occurred. However, England and France always sought to resolve the matter through diplomatic channels. The Thirteen-Nation Committee believed that even if there were border violations, they were not of an aggressive nature and were all the actions of local tribes. The A-country central government never encouraged them. Regarding the second point in the Italian memorandum, the report acknowledged that although the A-emperor had used all possible means to prohibit the slave system, there was actually little progress. Regarding the third point in the Italian memorandum, the report stated that when the A-country joined the League of Nations in 1923, the internal disturbances in the A-country were known to the countries that guaranteed the A-country's accession to the League of Nations at that time. The current internal situation in the A-country is no worse than in 1923. On the contrary, on the surface, the internal situation in the A-country is indeed more unified and stronger than before. The A-country needs foreign cooperation and assistance to improve its internal situation. The A-country representative admitted this point in his speech to the League of Nations General Assembly on September 11th of this year. In short, regarding the problems of the A-country, unless they are based on respect for the independence, integrity, and security of the member states of the League of Nations, there is no other way to solve them. Also, the Italian memorandum was delivered to the League of Nations on September 4th of this year, but the A-country first submitted its application to the League of Nations on December 14th of last year. After the A-country submitted its application, the Italian government opposed the League of Nations Administrative Council's discussion of the Italian-A issue and continued to send troops to East Africa. Since the beginning of the Italian-A dispute, the Abyssinian government has consistently sought a peaceful solution. The A-country has accepted and requested that neutral observers be sent to the local area for investigation. On the contrary, after the arbitration and resolution of the Hua-Er-Hua-Er conflict, Italy still demanded free action against the A-country and repeatedly stated that the situation in the A-country was special and could not be resolved by applying the League of Nations Covenant (Havas dispatch, 5th).</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Two Proposals</p>
<p>From the above suggestions of the Thirteen Committee's report, if Italy stops the war and withdraws its troops in the A-country, negotiations can now be conducted based on Article 15 of the Covenant, which stipulates that the administrative organ should peacefully resolve disputes. If Article 12 of the Covenant is, as expected, found to be actually violated, then sanctions should be adopted, and a committee to handle the adoption of sanctions will be established.</p>
<p>Sanction Steps</p>
<p>The first step of sanctions will be economic and financial in nature, and the severance of diplomatic relations between member states and the aggressor country is also within this plan.

<h3>The Abyssinian Government Sends a Note to the League of Nations, Requesting Sanctions Against Italy, Invoking Article 16, Section 2 of the Covenant, Vowing to Resist to the End to Defend National Territory</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian government recently delivered another note to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, stating, "The Abyssinian government respectfully and resolutely applies to the Council of the League of Nations, requesting that, based on the facts reported in the Emperor's previous telegram, it officially declare that, according to the interpretation of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, Italy has engaged in war. Therefore, the consequences stipulated in Article 16, Section 1 of the Covenant (i.e., a country engaged in aggression should be regarded as having committed an act of war against all members of the League of Nations, and other members should impose economic and financial sanctions) should, in fact, be deemed to have been established. The Abyssinian government further requests the Council to fulfill the obligations stipulated in Article 16, Section 2 of the Covenant (i.e., the Council should recommend to the governments of the countries concerned to take effective military measures to maintain the effectiveness of the Covenant), so that the armed conflict that violates the law and sacred covenants will be quickly terminated. The Abyssinian government hereby declares that the people of Abyssinia are prepared to shed their last drop of blood to defend Abyssinian independence and territorial integrity, resolutely and unyieldingly resisting this unjust war. Even if the enemy troops possess superior weapons and are cruelly and insatiably slaughtering, the Abyssinian people will never submit to violence, for the Abyssinian people deeply know that they are sacrificing not only to defend Abyssinia but also for the independence of all small and weak countries. If an aggressor who uses violence is allowed to achieve victory without resistance, then all small and weak countries in the world will become prey. For this reason, the Abyssinian government hereby applies again to the League of Nations, reiterating that treaties must be respected, that war is illegal, and that it is awaiting orders with utmost urgency."

<h3>The United States Implements an Arms Embargo, Facilitating League of Nations Sanctions, Welcomed by London and Geneva</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued a proclamation today, stating that a state of war exists between Italy and Abyssinia.  Therefore, the measures stipulated in the U.S. Neutrality Act, prohibiting the transportation of arms to belligerent countries, will naturally be effectively implemented. This embargo is limited to arms but does not include raw materials. What is prohibited includes various rifles and machine guns, various ammunition, various warships, various aircraft (whether military or civilian, whole or in parts), aircraft engines, mustard gas, and flamethrowers, etc. According to recent statistics released by the State Department, the United States has rarely transported arms to Abyssinia.  Therefore, Abyssinia will not be affected by this embargo, but Italy will lose its source of aircraft parts and engines. As for other arms, exports to Italy are of little importance. President Roosevelt is still aboard the cruiser Houston. After receiving the State Department's official report on the war between Italy and Abyssinia, he decided to issue the aforementioned proclamation and sent a wireless message to Secretary of State Hull, instructing him to handle the matter accordingly. President Roosevelt also issued the following remarks: "Although we have held out hope that war could be avoided, and we have made efforts in this regard, we can only acknowledge the simple and certain fact that Italian and Abyssinian troops are now engaged in combat, and the state of war referred to in the Neutrality Act now exists. Under these special circumstances, I want to make it clear to the people that anyone who voluntarily engages in any form of transaction with any party to the belligerent countries does so at their own risk." President Roosevelt's statement, which does not provide any protection to citizens trading with belligerent countries, is a step further than what is stipulated in the Neutrality Act. Previously, Senators Clark and others had made such a proposal, but it was not passed by Congress.  A careful reading of President Roosevelt's remarks indicates that the United States does not want to formally protect cargo ships heading to belligerent countries, does not want to oppose the blockade actions of the League of Nations or any other country, and does not want to insist on the rights of neutral countries to trade. (Reuters dispatch, 5th) The U.S. government's decision to strictly enforce the prohibition of arms shipments to both Italy and Abyssinia has been enthusiastically welcomed by British political circles and various circles of the League of Nations, who feel that this move by the United States has provided important guidance to the Council of the League of Nations and view it as a contribution of "inviting sanctions and the United States not interfering."

<h3>Berlin Newspapers Observe the East African War Situation, Italian Forces Limited by Geography, Victory is Difficult, Potential for Escalation into British-Italian Conflict</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German circles are very interested in the Italo-Abyssinian conflict. Major German newspapers have sent special correspondents to the front lines in Italy and Abyssinia to observe the war. German military experts have many doubts about whether Italy can win, believing that although Italy possesses new-style weapons, the geographical difficulties of Abyssinia will render the new-style weapons ineffective. Some people believe that there is a possibility that Britain and Italy may engage in armed conflict, which would undoubtedly benefit Germany. As for the general German population, they all oppose Italy, believing that it is insufficient to use a country's cultural backwardness as a pretext for attacking it. If that were the case, then in a few years, Germany could also use the fact that France's adoption of a democratic system is more backward than German politics as a pretext to attack France. The Nazi Party also does not approve of Italy, because Mussolini opposes Germany's annexation of Austria. Some Nazi newspapers are very dissatisfied with Italy, believing that Italy's fascism and Germany's National Socialism are not the same. In Europe, Italy's fascist system has a better reputation, so they cannot help but be jealous. However, the Nazi Party is quite pleased that the Anglo-French-Italian united front established by the Stresa Conference has broken down after the Italo-Abyssinian conflict occurred. However, seeing that the relationship between Britain and France is growing stronger, they cannot help but feel regret. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Difficult Problem of International Sanctions</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the League of Nations has never applied the provisions regarding sanctions in Article 16 of the Covenant. In the Manchurian Incident, the League of Nations work ended in a failed mediation due to Britain's unwillingness to take responsibility, and the fact of aggression succeeded. Now that the Italian army has captured Aduwa, and the League of Nations' report has also been published, the work of Article 15 of the Covenant has been completed, and the work of Article 16 must begin. Whether or not to implement sanctions is one question. The extent and scope of implementation is another question. Whether the implementation is effective and whether there are dangers is an even bigger question. Recently, the British side, in order to awaken the attention of France and the United States, expressed its attitude towards this problem. First, it said that if sanctions are implemented, all powerful countries must be included. Second, it said that the implementation of sanctions must not fail due to the actions of non-member states. The former is addressed to France and other countries within the League of Nations, deeply worried that they will adopt the tactic of watching the fire from across the wall or throwing stones down the well. The latter is addressed to the United States and other countries outside the League of Nations, deeply fearing that they will gloat over the misfortune, take advantage of the fire, and profit from the fisherman's gain in the fight over the wall. Britain's situation is difficult, and the weaknesses of the League of Nations have been revealed, and the difficulty of the sanctions problem is also obvious.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant, it is to enable Article 10 of the Covenant to maintain its sanctity. The content of Article 10 is that the member states of the League of Nations respect and guarantee the territorial integrity and political independence of each member state. Whether a country is large or small, once it is invaded by another country, the entire League of Nations is responsible for fulfilling this guarantee obligation. Sanctions are the punishment for the aggressor, so that it will be afraid beforehand and regret afterwards. The sanction methods listed in Article 16 are economic sanctions, military sanctions, and political sanctions. Political sanctions are the expulsion of the aggressor from the League of Nations. It does no harm to the aggressor. We can prove it from the past of Japan. Military sanctions have always been opposed by some countries, believing that it is replacing violence with violence, which is not the original intention of peace. Therefore, the Covenant only stipulates that the League of Nations can suggest that certain countries contribute naval, land, and air forces, and that the countries do not stop the transit of international troops. However, whether to contribute or not is the freedom of each country, and there is no obligation to obey. Economic sanctions are the most promising of all sanctions. However, according to the resolutions of previous League of Nations conferences, whether or not each country participates in sanctions is decided by the government of each country. The degree of participation is also not forced. If there are geographical or factual difficulties, they can also be exempted from participation. Seeing this, the powerlessness of the sanction clauses is obvious, and it is difficult to maintain the sanctity of Article 10 with Article 16.</p>
<p>However, the center of gravity of international sanctions is not in the clauses and laws, but in actual politics. First, the world's most powerful countries, such as the United States and Japan, are not members of the League of Nations and have no obligation to maintain the Covenant. Second, the powerful countries within the League of Nations, due to different environments and different security requirements, use the League of Nations as a tool for diplomacy and politics, rather than as an ideal and purpose. Therefore, in the Manchurian Incident, Britain refused the request of the United States by using Japan to value itself. In the Abyssinian problem, France did not have the determination to accept British leadership by using Italy to value itself. Sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, each is right in its own way. Third, the concept of joint responsibility and collective peace has not yet defeated the concept of national sovereignty supreme. There are more than fifty countries in the world, and there are more than fifty highest wills, each of which considers its own interests as the final decision condition. For example, it is actually impossible for Canada to block Italy or for Norway to assist Abyssinia. Fourth, the interdependence of the economies of various countries is increasing day by day. If Italy is blockaded, many countries that rely on Italy's raw materials and Italy's markets will see increased unemployment and factories closing their doors. Fifth, the cause of war has not been eliminated. Among the imperialist countries, there are satisfied and dissatisfied ones. Among the nationalist countries, there are those who invade other nationalities and those who are invaded by other nationalities. The maintenance of this status quo inevitably has unfair reasons. The sanction provisions are only to maintain this status quo. All these reasons are political in nature and cannot be saved by the modification of clauses or the loyalty of one or two countries.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) In response to an inquiry from the Henan Provincial Government regarding whether there are restrictions on foreigners coming to China to preach, the Ministry of Interior stated that if Chinese nationals affiliated with foreign religious organizations such as Catholic or Protestant churches are found to be violating existing laws under false pretenses, they should be dealt with according to the law. Foreigners coming to China to preach are subject to the "Provisional Regulations on Foreign Churches in the Interior Renting Land and Buildings," but no other restrictions are in place. Furthermore, there is no precedent prohibiting congregations in County A from establishing missions in Counties B and C. However, the local administrative authorities should be consulted beforehand to ensure proper supervision and protection. If a church requests official protection, it may be granted at the discretion of the authorities. This information has been communicated to all provincial and municipal governments for their reference. (Sixth Dispatch)</p>

As for the reorganization of Sichuan coinage, according to a survey by the Provincial Department of Finance, there are a total of 70 million yuan in miscellaneous coins in the province. The complete recall and recoining of the national currency, excluding transportation costs, minting costs, and losses, will result in a loss of over 3 million yuan. It has been agreed that the Sichuan Department of Finance will be responsible, and the Central Mint will handle the minting. There are no other difficulties.

<h3>The Mission of the Committee for the Reorganization Plan of the Yuehan Railway</h3>

They interviewed Xia Guangyu, the chairman of the committee, at the Pacific Hotel in Hankou. According to Xia, the Yuehan Railway, which runs from Wuchang in the north to Guangzhou in the south, is a crucial trunk line in southern China. After the establishment of the National Government, attention was immediately paid to the work of completing the entire line. The Ministry of Railways has made great efforts to complete the remaining project for the Zhushao section using Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds. After the railway is open to traffic in the future, it is essential that the repayment of principal and interest is fulfilled on schedule to establish credibility. This is crucial for securing funds for future construction of new lines. Therefore, the future of national railway policy is extremely important. In order to achieve this goal, the entire line must generate reliable profits each year after it opens to traffic, sufficient to cover the required repayment of principal and interest. The committee's most important mission is to plan how to develop affairs after the entire line opens to traffic, so that the operating revenue, in addition to maintaining the road, will be sufficient for repayment of principal and interest. Therefore, the transportation organization, engineering, finance, and other aspects of the completed and unified road are all interrelated and must be organized and planned in advance.

<h3>Prospects of the Italo-Ethiopian War: Staging an Attack on Ethiopia to Maintain Domestic Rule; If the Incident Escalates, Britain and France Will Be the First to Join the Vortex</h3>
<p>France's protection of Italy is also related to the previous Anglo-German naval agreement. The Anglo-German naval agreement is tantamount to Britain helping Germany rise and making things difficult for France. Therefore, France's attitude towards the current Italo-Ethiopian dispute seems to disregard British interests. Its ambiguous response to Britain's proposal for a joint front further reveals France's blatant protection of Italy.</p>
<p>(4) What will happen if the incident escalates?</p>
<p>However, if the Italo-Ethiopian war drags on and the incident escalates, and if Britain is drawn into the vortex, then France will inevitably join forces with Britain to jointly restrain Italy.</p>
<p>British diplomacy has always been known as "cunning." If war breaks out between Britain and Italy, and France does not provide assistance, then Britain will also stay out of European continental affairs and focus on dealing with its colonies. If so, the peace mechanism of the European continental bloc will completely collapse, and the Locarno Treaty, which guarantees France, will be torn to shreds. Therefore, in terms of diplomatic principles, France still takes cooperation with Britain to maintain the European status quo as a prerequisite. The possibility of a joint Anglo-French front to restrain Italy is still greater.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Minister once questioned the British Foreign Minister, saying, "Since the British government insists on upholding the League of Nations Covenant, if an act of aggression occurs on the European continent, such as a third country (referring to Germany) invading Austria's independence and peace, will Britain still be able to express its determination at that time?" Commentators also say that France has already allowed assistance if Italy attacks Britain, which is indeed believable. In short, if Britain is drawn into the vortex of the Italo-Ethiopian war, France will inevitably take action immediately. Although the Italo-Ethiopian war may not directly trigger a European war, it will undoubtedly become the cause of future European chaos. Observing Germany's silence and Italy's reckless behavior, one can be convinced.</p>
<p>(1) The Inevitability of Italy's Attack on Ethiopia</p>
<p>The Italo-Ethiopian war has already broken out. Tracing back to its origin, it is said that it was caused by Italy's attempt to conquer Abyssinia. Judging from Abyssinia's attitude of bowing its head and listening to Britain's proposal to the League of Nations for a peaceful resolution before the conflict, Abyssinia has in fact become a territory under international joint administration since 1906, when Britain, France, and Italy divided their spheres of influence in Abyssinia. Concessions have reached the extreme, but why is Italy determined to conquer Abyssinia this time?</p>
<p>Based on reports from all sides and the internal contradictions within Italy, it can be seen that Italy's attack on Ethiopia has reasons: (1) Italy lacks natural resources and faces a population problem due to a lack of imperialism, so it needs to implement a national expansion policy to plunder colonies; (2) Abyssinia is the most suitable destination for Italy to obtain resources and establish relationships; (3) In recent years since the establishment of the Italian regime, financial and economic loopholes have repeatedly appeared, and high-pressure policies have been gradually adopted towards the people, leading to growing popular resentment. Mussolini intends to divert public attention by waging war abroad; (4) Mussolini wants to increase the people's faith in him, instigate the Italian people's idea of revenge by using the defeat in the Ethiopian war more than 30 years ago, and colonize Ethiopia; (5) Since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, the European balance of power has been disrupted. In order to counter Germany, France has to compromise with Italy, making this the best time for Italy to conquer Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Italians have been preparing for more than a year since they decided to attack Ethiopia. The military expenditure spent in the past year has reached 800 million lira, and the dispatched forces have also reached 200,000. As a result, the financial deficit continues to increase, and export trade is gradually declining. Therefore, Mussolini used colonization policies, national expansion, racial struggles, and the recovery of the defeat at Adowa as pretexts for attacking Ethiopia. In fact, there is another inevitability.</p>
<p>(2) Italy's Attack on Ethiopia and Britain</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle to Italy's attack on Ethiopia is Britain. The reason why Italy has hesitated for so long is also because it does not know how to deal with Britain. However, Britain opposes Italy's attack on Ethiopia on the grounds that Italy's act of aggression directly undermines the peace mechanism of the European group. At the League of Nations Council meeting on September 4, British representative Eden repeatedly stated that he was willing to uphold the League of Nations' principles of peace and mediate the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. In fact, the League of Nations is nothing more than an agency for Britain and France. If it can uphold peace, how could the Sino-Japanese dispute have occurred?</p>
<p>The reason why Britain is unwilling to attack Ethiopia is that its own territory borders Ethiopia. Preserving Ethiopia's formal independence is to safeguard its colonial interests in the Philippines. Judging from the geographical situation of Abyssinia, it can be seen that Abyssinia is surrounded by the colonies of Britain, France, and Italy, and the interests of the three countries in Abyssinia are extremely complex. In the mid-19th century, when Abyssinia leased Somaliland and Eritrea to Italy, Italy had almost exclusive rights in Abyssinia. Later, through the 1906 treaty between Britain, France, and Italy, Abyssinia became a sphere of equilibrium for the three countries, which was also a move by Britain and France to jointly contain Italy. Today, Britain's attitude towards Italy is still to maintain its inherent influence in Abyssinia.</p>
<p>In 1923, when France brought Abyssinia into the League of Nations, we still remember Britain's expression of opposition. The reasons it held were exactly the same as Mussolini's derogatory remarks about Abyssinia today, saying that Abyssinia is a barbaric country with a slave system. How can it be included among the civilized countries of the League of Nations? The words are still in my ears. Is it that the British people are forgetful? In particular, Britain is unwilling to attack Ethiopia. If Italy wins Abyssinia, Britain's interests in Abyssinia will be in jeopardy. If Abyssinia does not win, the colonies of Britain in the Philippines will continue to resist, and it will also be enough to influence the resistance consciousness of other small and weak ethnic groups in British colonies, which is all unfavorable to Britain. What Britain wants is to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>(3) Italy's Attack on Ethiopia and France</p>
<p>To further elaborate on France's attitude towards the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, we must first understand the nature of France's interests in Ethiopia. France's interests in Ethiopia are different from those of Italy and Britain. Italy has a railway between its territory Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, initially wanting to seize Abyssinia's mineral resources, and then wanting Abyssinia to become Italy's protectorate. Britain cultivates cotton in Egypt and Sudan along the Nile River as a supply of raw materials for Britain's cotton industry. The irrigation of Kamsu relies on water from the Nile, and the discharge of the Nile originates from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. If the water source of Lake Tana is cut off, Britain's Egyptian-Sudanese region will become barren land. Therefore, Britain's contention for rights in Ethiopia is also fierce. However, France's attitude towards Ethiopia is different. France already has an exclusive railway in Ethiopia, and the path to cultural facilities and development in Ethiopia is still far away. France is not as active in Ethiopia as Italy and Britain, but it does not want Ethiopia to be exclusively occupied by Italy or Britain.</p>
<p>France is deeply troubled by Germany. Since Hitler came to power, it has felt increasingly uneasy. Therefore, its concern for colonies can be said to be secondary to its concern for the European continent. Since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, revived its military, and attempted to merge with Austria, France has been extremely sensitive and alarmed by Germany's every move. Therefore, regarding the current Italo-Ethiopian dispute, it is said that Italy has long obtained France's understanding. This is also due to France's policy towards Germany, which has led it to protect Italy.</p>
<h3>The "Haiqi" and "Chen" Warships Return to the Fleet; Xie Gangzhe Returns to Qingdao from Beijing; Temporarily Stationed in the Yangtze River After Returning to the Fleet</h3>
<p>Qingdao News: Xie Gangzhe, commander of the Third Naval Fleet, went to Beijing last month to consult with military and political authorities on all matters related to the return of the "Haiqi" and "Chen" warships to the fleet. It is now learned that Xie returned to Qingdao on the morning of the 4th. According to Xie, he went to Beijing in late August to discuss the return of the two warships to the fleet. After more than 40 days of consultations, everything has been largely settled. While in Beijing, he met with Chairman Lin, President Wang, and officials from various military and political agencies, and went to Lushan to meet with Chairman Jiang to consult on everything. The results of the meeting were extremely satisfactory. As for the "Haiqi" and "Chen" warships, the monthly expenses require about 50,000 yuan. After returning to the fleet, it will be allocated monthly by the Beiping Military Branch. The captains of the two warships will still be Zhang and Tang. They are currently stationed in Xiaguan, engaged in training. The date of their arrival in the north has not yet been determined. In addition, about 170 people were laid off from the two warships this time, all of whom were old comrades. They are currently staying in Nanjing. Once they are idled, it is particularly inappropriate. After I return to Weihai, I plan to supplement the naval training team with these laid-off personnel and continue to serve the country. Because I have been away from my post for a long time, all affairs need to be taken care of urgently. I will not stay in Qingdao for long and will return to Weihai within a few days. (4th)</p>

<h3>After the Outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War; The Impact on Shanghai's Industry and Commerce; Cotton Yarn and Steel Prices Rise; Raw Silk Exports Sharply Decrease</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: Since the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War, people are terrified of the tragic nature of the previous European War. Those who are nervous almost believe that the second world war will follow one after another. Therefore, it has a great impact on Chinese industrialists and businessmen. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter recorded the significant changes that have already occurred in various industries:</p>
<p>Cotton yarn: In recent days, the yarn and cotton market has been affected by the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War. Foreign telegrams have reported price increases every day. The Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange believes that the import of American cotton has decreased, and the price has also risen. It is found that raw cotton is an indispensable raw material for military supplies, and countries are competing to purchase it. It once rose by 40 pounds a ton the day before. However, the cotton produced in my country is not suitable for spinning fine yarn because its fibers are short and can only be used to spin coarse yarn, so it is difficult to abandon foreign cotton. Moreover, the weather has turned cold in recent days, and customers from all over the world are very enthusiastic about purchasing cotton yarn, which has led to a shortage of現 yarn and a price increase. Shenxin is the largest yarn factory in my country, with the most branches and a large output. It had previously stopped trading due to a shortage of 現 goods. According to yarn industry observers, given the current旺 situation, yarn factories that have stopped work and reduced work will be able to gradually return to their original state.</p>
<p>Steel: The steel菐 market has been sluggish since the spring of this year. Rongda, Maofeng, Renji, and others have successively gone bankrupt. The current prices of various goods have fallen by one yuan and several 角 compared with the spring. After the public meeting decided to stop ordering goods, three months later, due to the scarcity of goods in the market and the tense situation in Italy and Ethiopia, it began to be slightly firm. Since the news of the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War came, people in the industry, in view of the profiteering of the steel industry during the First World War, the market atmosphere suddenly became firm and昂, and the opening price soared by one yuan and as many as three or five 角, and there was still no intention to sell, which caused the iron market to fall into a chaotic state. It is feared that once Britain and France are drawn into the vortex, the steel in the Suez Canal will also be one of the embargoed items. In Japan, steel has also been reported to have risen by 20 yuan a ton. However, in Europe and the United States, in addition to charging military insurance fees, there has been no news of price increases.</p>
<p>Raw silk: Autumn silk in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been put on the market one after another, but the output is sharply reduced compared with spring silkworms. Silk merchants buy and pull prices higher than spring silkworms. Since the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War, foreign firms stationed in Shanghai that purchase Chinese silk from Europe and the United States have not dared to抛 buy futures Chinese silk. At the same time, foreign shipping companies have raised the freight rates for Chinese silk imported from China to Europe and the United States from October 1, restoring the previous price of US$4 per piece from US$1.2. As a result, raw silk exports have sharply decreased compared with last month. The silk price of B grade is about 500 yuan in national currency per dan. Therefore, the future of Chinese silk cannot be predicted for a while.</p>

<h3>Factory Fire Inspection: The Shanghai South District Has Been Completed; The Zhabei Districts Will Continue</h3>
<p>The Ta Kung News Agency reports: The Municipal Public Security Bureau's factory fire inspection has been carried out very carefully since it began in July of this year, so the progress has been rather slow. The Shanghai South District has only recently been completed. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, based on observations of the inspected factories in the South City, the buildings of the factories are mostly simple and the equipment is incomplete, which is not suitable for establishing factories. Moreover, more than 75% do not comply with building regulations, such as building lofts and converting houses into factory buildings, etc., which is very detrimental to public safety. And the fire-fighting equipment is particularly neglected, and fires are very easy to occur. The focus of the Bureau's fire inspection is on this. However, due to the current economic downturn, in order to be considerate of business difficulties, for the building part, if there is no excessive danger, they are ordered to be careful to protect themselves at any time without being banned. However, those with significant dangers, such as reed mats, waste wood, etc., are ordered to be demolished and cleaned up, and fire-fighting equipment, such as foam fire extinguishers and Taiping faucets, are also required to be installed. The inspection of the Shanghai South District has only been completed recently because there are more factories in the district. After this, Zhabei, Shanghai West, Pudong, and other districts will continue to be held until the inspection is completed.</p>

<h3>Before the Administrative Penalty for Navigation is Decided, the Shipping Company Can First Handle the Navigation Procedures; It Will Be Implemented Nationwide from Today with the Approval of the Ministry.</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the business of shipping companies, the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau plans to allow shipping companies to obtain a guarantee from the shop that they will be available at any time to handle the navigation procedures for administrative penalty cases under the Shipping Law, so as to avoid delays and losses. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Communications for review, and the Ministry has now approved it for implementation. The original text is recorded below: Order No. 438 of the Ministry of Communications: "According to the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau's report, 'According to the report of the Ningbo Office, the Bureau forwarded the Ministry of Communications Shipping Vessel No. 3506 order, which stated that administrative penalty cases concerning the Shipping Law should be handled by the court in accordance with the example of penalties for company violations, so as to be uniform, etc., and forwarded it to the Bureau for disposal. Upon receipt of this, the Office has already complied with it. However, it is found that the judicial organs handle cases with troublesome procedures, often delaying for days. If administrative penalty cases concerning the Shipping Law must be handled after the court has completed the procedures before the navigation procedures can be handled, it will definitely take up time, and the shipping company will suffer losses. In order to facilitate the business of the shipping company, the Office will allow the shipping company to obtain a guarantee from the shop that they will be available at any time to handle the over-navigation procedures for administrative penalty cases concerning the Shipping Law. It has been quite convenient for a month. Court procedures are uniform throughout the country, and shipping companies in other places are not without the same pain. A special document is prepared for review and forwarding,' etc. It is found that the above-mentioned method is still feasible if it is approved. It is proposed that when such cases occur in the future, in addition to being transferred to the court for review, the shipping company should also be ordered to provide a guarantee and release them, and at the same time, report to the higher authorities for record-keeping, so as to prevent abuses,'" etc. It is found that the various sections reported are still feasible. In the future, for administrative penalty cases concerning the Shipping Law, in addition to being transferred to the court for review, a reliable guarantee should be obtained for advance release, and it is stipulated that if these cases are handled by the Shipping Administration Bureau or directly transferred to the office, they should be reported to the Ministry at the same time. If they are handled by the Shipping Administration Bureau office, they should be reported to the Ministry at the same time through the Shipping Administration Bureau under its jurisdiction for review and record-keeping. In addition to issuing orders separately, you are hereby ordered to comply with them. This order.</p>

A preparatory committee for the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Law Society was organized at the Aimai Road Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession. It was established yesterday, and three committees, Shen Junru as the accounting director, Guo Wei as the document director, and Jiang Yiping as the communication director, are responsible for actively proceeding. However, in Shanghai, Zhuo Jing has a judicial organization, the Chinese Law Society, which has been registered and has branches in various places. According to judicial figures, it is necessary to discuss the merger in the future.</p>
<h3>Robberies Are Frequent on the Road Beside Yinggong Temple</h3>
<p>Li Wang, a local woman residing on Lafayette Road in the French Concession, collected 60 yuan in association fees at about 8:00 PM the night before last. While walking on the road south of Qingjietang Yinggong Temple on Penglai Road in the city, she was overtaken and robbed by thugs. The woman refused to give up and resisted. The thieves became angry, took out sharp knives, stabbed the woman's right arm, and shed blood all over her body. They also punched the woman to the ground and snatched all the money she was holding in her hand and fled. The woman was knocked unconscious, and passers-by woke her up, but the robbers were gone. The woman immediately reported to the nearby Wenmiao Road Police Station for investigation and arrest, and then went to Qu Zhifu Hospital to sew up and bandage the wound. There are many side roads in the middle of the road at Yinggong Temple, and the robbers can easily escape with the stolen goods. Especially at night, there are few pedestrians, so robberies often occur. Although there are posts in between, there is a sense of being able to take care of one but not the other. I hope that those in power will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Record of the Shaoxing Wine Industry Association Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shaoxing Wine Industry Association of this city held its 27th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday. The committee members present were Fang Changsheng, Song Zizhengrong, Wang Zhiqiang, Zhou Jinrong, Chen Jingyun, Xie Jinkui, and other eleven people. Zhou Jinrong chaired the meeting. The agenda items were reported and proposed as usual: (1) The association's annual recurring fee collection case for the 25th year was resolved. If the original place can collect it, it will remain the same; otherwise, the second step will be carried out. (2) After the new stamp tax law was implemented on September 1st, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued two kinds of stamp tax laws and implementation rules. It was resolved that the association should extract and print various legal interpretations and distribute them to members for reference to avoid misunderstandings and penalties. (3) A small number of members of the association resisted paying membership fees. It was resolved that the person in charge should be sent to urge them to pay. If they still refuse to pay, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will be reported to handle it in accordance with the Ministry of Industry's No. 378 approval. (4) Tongye in Pudong stockpiled good and bad wine from the era of public sales. Recently, the sub-bureau forwarded a letter from the provincial bureau, requiring the new and old to be tied together and resolved at the same time. It was resolved that since Tongye's new certificate wine has been taxed and a new certificate has been obtained, the procedures have been completed, and it is still not allowed to be sold freely. Tongye has no way to sell all the good and bad wine from the era of public sales. How can they suffer losses again? It is unfair. It was resolved to submit a report to the higher-level tax authorities for flexible handling. If it is not approved, further requests will be made. (5) Wang Zhiyu recently transported Chen Shihe's wine jars and was seized by the South Station Inspection Office. The association has already explained the reasons and certified them, but they have not been released. It was found that Wang Zhiyu's wine was indeed taxed and the production, sales, and transportation documents were complete. It was decided to release them after a local investigation to relieve business difficulties and suppress grievances. The above five cases were unanimously passed and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Cui Tongyue Sold Books to Help with the Account</h3>
<p>Mr. Cui Tongyue is a revolutionary veteran. In the past, he promoted the revolution overseas and made remarkable achievements. Today (the 6th) is his seventy-second birthday. Relatives, friends, and old friends celebrated his birthday. Cui, feeling deeply about the severe flood this year, generously donated his book "Canghai Manuscripts" to help with the disaster relief. According to his own statement, "I returned to China for the second time from the United States on April 19th of the 21st year and stayed in Shanghai. Because I was engaged in education and journalism, I once ran the "Minzu" and "Chunqiu" weekly magazines after arriving in Shanghai. At the end of the period, I voluntarily stopped publishing due to direct writing and changed to the position of training and history professor at Jinan University. Suddenly, a student riot occurred, and I avoided it by traveling to the Philippines for several months. Occasionally, friends or students would invite me to tutor Chinese for free. Recently, I wrote "Canghai's Life" in two volumes, which briefly describes my personal experience in the three revolutions in Guangzhou in the years of Yiwei, Gengzi, and Renyin. After fleeing, I founded the "World Public Welfare Daily", "Huaying Daily", and "Youth China Morning Post", all of which vigorously promoted the revolution before the Xinhai Revolution, offending teachers and friends. The Party and the country are inevitable. I ask myself that my sin is unforgivable, let alone meritorious. Now, I am very ashamed to be celebrated by comrades. I would like to donate the book price and remaining expenses to relieve hungry and cold compatriots. I think everyone will understand. My second son, Ailiang, and eldest daughter, Aihuan, live in the countryside and farm. My fourth daughter, Aihua, is studying liberal arts at Columbia University in New York. My fifth son, Zhenqiu, is currently the captain of the 12th Gendarmerie Team in Guangzhou. My sixth daughter, Aiying, is ten years old and is studying in a Guangdong middle school. Together with my wife, Jiang Su, we live a simple family life at No. 1 Sanyili, Chuan Highway, North Shanghai."</p>

<h3>A Handgun Was Recovered from the River Under Xinzha Bridge; Niece-in-law of Qian Guisheng Summoned for Questioning</h3>
<p>The former residence of Qian Guisheng (deceased), the former mayor of Zhabei, at No. 63 Changan Road, Zhabei, discovered a six-round pistol and 19 bullets in a kerosene tank when demolishing a loft the day before yesterday. The female owner, surnamed Sui, fearing an accident, wrapped them in a cloth bag and had the maid tie them with bricks and sink them under Xinzha Bridge to destroy the evidence. Unexpectedly, the Xinzha Branch Bureau learned of this and sent detectives to hire a boat to recover them and summoned the deceased Qian Guisheng's niece-in-law, Sui, 53 years old, a local, and the maid, Zhang Chen, 52 years old, from Changshu, to the bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Police Receive Reports from Three Locations: Handwriting of Extortion Letters is the Same; Four People Already Arrested</h3>
<p>The Wang family at 50 Wutong Street in the city received successive threatening extortion letters with harsh language. The Wang family ignored them. Unexpectedly, in the last letter received a few days ago, they were asked to send a representative wearing a blue short jacket, a sash, and a duckbill cap to negotiate in the Yuanlong Lane of Manli Bridge between 9 and 10 pm. The Wang family had no choice but to take the letter to the local Yimiao Police Station for investigation. After Police Chief Liu examined the threatening letter, which referred to the Wang family as the former employer, Police Chief Liu personally led Inspector Qiang Zhide, along with patrol officer and police officers in disguise, and armed themselves secretly to lie in ambush. They waited for several nights without any results. Unexpectedly, the Zhou family at 2 Yuanyuan Lane, Lujiazhai, inside Xiaoshumen, also received several similar threatening extortion letters. The last letter instructed Zhou to wrap banknotes in white paper and place them at the entrance of Sunjia Lane on East Street at 10 pm the previous night. Zhou also took the letter to the Yimiao Police Station, requesting a strict investigation. Police Chief Liu observed that the handwriting of the extortion letters was the same as those received by the Wang family. Therefore, they disguised themselves and went to guard and arrest the culprit. At the appointed time, they saw a scrap collector picking up the paper package and fleeing. The detectives surrounded and captured him. He was immediately taken to the station. According to the scrap collector, named Xiao Zhenjiang, he was instructed by Xiao Liuzi and others who were drinking tea at a teahouse at Xinmatou, to pick it up for two jiao (cents), and did not know what was inside the package. Detectives were then ordered to point out and arrest them, and three people were indeed arrested. They are currently under interrogation. It is also heard that a certain family under the jurisdiction of the Xundaostreet Police Station also received a similar threatening extortion letter and is also under investigation.</p>
<h3>Yuan Xiangmin Attempts Suicide After Something Goes Wrong</h3>
<p>At around 12 noon yesterday, the staff of the Tianran Hotel at 66 Zhifu Road discovered that Yuan Xiangmin, a 25-year-old Ningbo traveler staying in room 216 on the upper floor of the hotel, had not yet gotten up. They instructed the tea boy to knock on the door and call him, but there was no response for a long time. Realizing something was wrong, they managed to open the door and found Yuan Xiangmin lying unconscious on the side of the bed, his face pale and foaming at the mouth. They immediately reported it to the police station and sent him to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the poisoning was not severe, and he gradually regained consciousness after treatment. According to Yuan, he used to work as a sample maker at a factory in Hangzhou, but was later dismissed due to some reason. He then came to Shanghai to make a living and currently lives at 1 Hengde Lane, 1 Hengtong Road, Zhabei. However, he has not achieved anything so far, and his financial situation has deteriorated, forcing him to resort to this measure.</p>
<h3>Female Suspect in Counterfeit Banknote Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Xiao Guangrong, from Shandong, runs a small cigarette and paper shop at 3, Lane 922, East Broadway Road. Last month, a child from Henan tried to exchange a fake one-yuan banknote from the Zhongnan Bank at his shop. The fraud was discovered on the spot, but the child was very alert and fled, abandoning the banknote. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, at around 9 am, Lin Dengen, from Haizhou, used a similar fake banknote to exchange for silver coins and was arrested by Chinese Detective Yin Zhanqing of the Huishan Police Station. Two fake one-yuan banknotes from the Zhongnan Bank and one ten-yuan banknote from China were also found during the search. He was taken to the police station. Upon questioning, the source of the counterfeit banknotes was traced to Hu Wang, a woman from Anhui, at 404 Beijingjiang Road, Zhabei. Detective Yin rushed there, and together with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, arrested Hu Wang and took her to the bureau for detention. The details of Lin's case, after being sent to the First Special District Court, have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police station obtained an official letter from the court, took Hu Wang back, and sent her to Attorney Li Zhishan of the Industrial Bureau's Criminal Court Three, who presented the case and requested a joint hearing. Hu Wang stated that she had known Lin Dengen for many years. Last November, his wife borrowed ten yuan from her. When her son asked for it back, they argued and fought, resulting in a grudge and false accusation. She claimed to know nothing about the fake banknotes and asked for justice. Presiding Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered her to be remanded in custody and scheduled a joint trial with Lin Dengen at a later date.</p>
<h3>Academic Lecture by the Dental Association: Lecture by Dentist Peng Juzhou</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Municipal Dental Association has spared no effort in its affairs. Based on the resolutions of the general meeting, it organized academic lecture meetings to encourage academic study and strive for progress in knowledge and skills. Yesterday, it held the first academic lecture meeting, inviting dentist Peng Juzhou, a graduate of Osaka Dental College who had taught at Southeast and Shanghai dental schools, to give a lecture. More than two hundred people attended the lecture, the topic of which was the relationship between dentures and fillings. The lecture first described the importance of dental caries in dental diseases, followed by the points to be noted in fitting dentures. He repeatedly explained the symptoms and dangers involved, and also gave detailed instructions on treatment and prevention methods. Important points were illustrated with diagrams, which were highly praised by the audience. The length of the speech was abbreviated. The association will compile the lecture into handouts for distribution to its members.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Robs Drunken Westerner of Money, Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>At 2:30 AM on September 29th, a drunken Westerner named Di Maike hired a rickshaw pulled by Ding Jingaogao from Jiangbei. While traveling along Maiketuo Road to a brothel, Ding, in collusion with three others who are still at large, took advantage of the situation to steal his wallet containing twelve shillings. The Westerner reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, which launched an investigation. On the 27th of last month, Ding was apprehended by Chinese and Western detectives, and sent to the First Special Court. After questioning and the conclusion of the trial, Presiding Judge Jiang Shuzi sentenced Ding Jingaogao to two years and six months of imprisonment in Criminal Court Three the day before yesterday. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized will be used to offset the imprisonment period, with two days of detention equaling one day of imprisonment.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the Literary Master: Zeng Mengpu Memorial Service Held in Yu, Participants from All Walks of Life, Simple Chariot and White Horses, a Grand Occasion</h3>
<p>Mr. Zeng Mengpu of Qinchuan was a literary master. His writings and translations totaled hundreds of volumes. Unfortunately, he passed away in June this summer due to overwork. Individuals who had old friendships with Mr. Zeng in Suzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, and Wuhan, as well as people from academic, political, business, and scholarly circles, and various academic organizations, initiated a memorial service at Yushan to commemorate him. Approximately 500 individuals and 30-40 organizations were listed as participants. The memorial service was held yesterday (Double Ninth Festival) at Xiaoyao You (located at the foot of Yushan) in Changshu. The ceremony was solemn, and the attendees were filled with sorrow when remembering this literary figure. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue: The memorial service venue was a four-sided hall with substantial space. The East Boat Hall served as a rest area for guests. Mourning couplets and elegies were hung inside and outside the hall and along the corridors. A portrait of Mr. Zeng was hung in the center of the hall, lifelike and full of passion. About forty people lingered around. Wreaths were placed around the portrait. A floral archway was erected at the entrance of Xiaoyao You. A bamboo cloth horizontal plaque was hung above the archway at the Fudi of Yushan. The arrangement was solemn and simple.</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony: Some participants from Shanghai arrived in Yu the day before. At about 10:00 AM on the morning of the day, the guests (all representatives and leaders from all walks of life) arrived and took their seats. The public memorial ceremony began: (1) Everyone stood at attention; (2) The chief mourner (presumed to be Zhang Zhongren from Wuxian) took his place; (3) Playing mourning music; (4) Performing the sacrificial rite (three bows); (5) Offering flowers; (6) Silent mourning; Reading elegies: First, the chief mourner read the public memorial elegy, followed by Li Haoran representing Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shishi Xinbao, Shibao, Chen Bao, Min Bao, Zhonghua Ribao, and Da Wanbao, Shao Xunmei representing Shanghai Times Book Company, and Feng Wuchang and Wu Qiqian reading elegies; (7) Playing mourning music; (8) Ceremony concluded. Subsequently, the memorial service was held: (1) Everyone stood at attention, (2) Playing mourning music, (3) Three bows to the national flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, (4) The chairman (Zhang Zhongren) respectfully read Sun Yat-sen's will, (5) The chairman reported the significance of the meeting and a brief biography of the deceased, (6) Representatives from all walks of life, including Yan Duhe, Jiang Zifan, Bao Tianxiao, Zhu Dexuan, Chen Yingsun, and Xu Weinan, delivered speeches, (7) The Zeng family delivered a response, (8) Meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Zhang Zhongren, over seventy years old, with silver hair, was still full of energy. Mr. Mengpu had a deep friendship with him during his lifetime. During the Jiang-Zhe war, they both resented the tyranny of the warlords and the devastation of the people. They advocated to end the war and exerted themselves for peace. Therefore, he had a deep understanding of Mr. Mengpu's political views. In his report, he cited facts to show Mr. Zeng's diligence in politics and integrity in conduct. In literature, he also praised Mr. Zeng as a representative figure of the transition period between the old and the new. The following speeches were delivered by the representatives, with the general meaning that the gentleman's ethics, politics, morality, learning, and all aspects were worthy of admiration and imitation. Yan Duhe used the three words Zhen (truth), Mei (beauty), and Shan (goodness) (Mr. Zeng ran the Zhenmeishan Bookstore in his later years) to describe the gentleman's personality, which was especially appropriate.</p>
<p>Three Proposals: Mr. Xu Weinan made three proposals: (1) Based on the precedents of foreign literary giants such as Tolstoy, Hugo, Goethe, and Shakespeare, he requested that Mr. Zeng's family retain the original state of the house, furniture, books, and other items used by Mr. Zeng in his daily life as a memorial room, open to the public for exhibition and mourning; (2) He proposed to organize a committee to publish Mr. Zeng's collected works; (3) He proposed to invite artists to cast a bronze statue of Mr. Zeng.</p>
<p>Family Response: Mr. Zeng Yunbai, Mr. Zeng's son, gave a speech of thanks to the guests, saying, "Today, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the guests for participating in the joint memorial service for my late father. On the other hand, I am privately delighted to discover for the first time the greatness of my late father's spirit. It is difficult to avoid the change, the death, but there are still many people who remember him, which shows that his spirit will always exist. Everything he did in his life will always remain imprinted in the minds of many people, especially in the minds of our brothers, who can inherit his legacy."</p>
<p>Mourning Couplets and Elegies: The reporter hurriedly excerpted a few of the mourning couplets as follows: (1) "In the past, we were together during eventful times. We shared worries and difficulties, and we still relied on the sick man to save the East Mountain. Now that you have passed away, who will ask about the West Garden?" (Han Zishi). (2) "With a long talent for saving the world, you turned to writing to express your extraordinary spirit. Thinking of your family, you became seriously ill, enduring the pain of recalling old visits to the garden." (Zhang Zhongren). (3) "The sea of sin is a satire of the strange, a complete illusion. You should realize that everything is like a dream. The remnant poems of the Liao River are gone, returning to the pure land. After thirty years of friendship, everything is like smoke." (Chen Taoyi). (4) "Your writing was truly brilliant. The unofficial history compiled and transmitted the Karmic Bonds of Sinful Affairs. An elder has passed away, and literary masters have admired Yushan for thousands of years." (Liu Yazi). (5) "Your writing is as difficult as two things, like pearls and jade joined together. The rise and fall of a generation will be passed down from household to household in the Flowers in a Sea of Sin." (Zhu Yingpeng). Due to space limitations, the rest are omitted. The public memorial elegy is as follows: "Alas, Mr. Zeng, is your life over? The world is in pain, and our party laments. Only you, in your early years, surpassed the group in writing. You were also proficient in textual research, continuing the Han Dynasty's literary works. You occasionally used your spare skills to dabble in novels. The completion of The Sea of Karma was praised as a masterpiece. You wrote strategies and analyzed problems, and your writing was concise. Famous public officials and dignitaries invited you. You went out to govern, and you were in charge of the West Lake. You lingered on poetry and wine, following in the footsteps of Bai Juyi and Su Shi. You were eloquent in the parliament. You worked hard to plan the provincial affairs. Your writings were profound and broad, encompassing the Wei, Jin, Sui and Tang dynasties, eliminating all flowery language. Your political affairs followed the general outline, eliminating disturbances and resolving grievances, enriching the wealth and benefiting the people. Before the measures were halfway through, you suddenly gave up your responsibilities. The people's expectations were high, but Dongshan will not come again. Your conduct was both open and closed, and your circumstances were both frugal and abundant. Is it fate or luck, heaven or man? Those who come to mourn you, who do not sigh? Your successors, like phoenixes and phoenixes, with jade rings and earrings, overlapping and shoulder to shoulder. In your later years, you closed your doors and swept the ground, planting bamboo and eating flowers, leisurely enjoying old age. Alas, my lord, who can live forever? Moreover, in this year of great change, hardship is just beginning. The great men are not those of today. The writings in the famous mountains are enough for thousands of years. Who can do this immortal cause but you? It is enough, what is there to grieve? Only we, your colleagues, have a noble relationship with you. When the shocking news came, we were all surprised. Ashamed of those dignitaries, we falsely claimed to be dead friends, and hurried to the funeral with white horses and plain carriages. Alas, you are gone now, where is your spirit? In the body of Yin and Yang, we offer meager offerings with sincerity, a bundle of grass, a cup of wine. The love is deep but the gifts are meager, the tears are exhausted and the voice is hoarse. We remember your spirit as if you were here, and we hope that you will enjoy this ascent and descent. Alas, alas, I hope you..."</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Plans to Build Police Cemetery, Budget Set at Over 30,000 Yuan, Construction to Begin This Month and be Completed Next Spring</h3>
<p>According to Dagongshe, the former director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Mr. Wen Hongen, believed that there were many police officers in the bureau who had died in the line of duty over the years, and most of them were from other provinces, so it was very difficult to transport them back to their hometowns for burial. Therefore, he planned to build a police cemetery. However, Mr. Wen died of illness, and the director who succeeded him, Mr. Wen Chaoji, held the position for a short time and did not have time to realize this plan. Now, Director Cai believes that this plan would greatly benefit the police officers of the bureau and is feasible, so he has submitted a request to the Municipal Government to allocate funds and actively prepare for construction. It has now purchased more than 30 acres of land west of Huangjia Garden in Caoking District as the cemetery site. The cemetery plan was designed by architect Dong Dayou. The front is the cemetery road, leading directly to the cemetery gate, then the stele pavilion, followed by Bing Hall, and finally the cemetery. The cemetery can bury more than 1,000 people, surrounded by walls. The entire project will be constructed with steel, cement, Sanhe soil, artificial stone, and other materials. The estimated budget is over 30,000 yuan. More than 20,000 yuan has already been spent on purchasing the cemetery land, and there are still more than 10,000 yuan left. The bureau had previously announced to various construction companies to bid for the construction, and seven companies responded to the bidding. However, the prices they quoted were too high, so the bureau is still considering them. A decision can be made within the week, and construction can begin this month. It is expected that it will be completed in early spring next year.</p>
<h3>Man and Woman Attempt Suicide at Far East Hotel Yesterday, Minor Poisoning Not Fatal, Extravagant Behavior Suggests Upper Class</h3>
<p>Around 4 PM the day before yesterday, a tragic case of a husband and wife attempting suicide occurred at the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road in this city. The details are as follows: On the 4th of this month, a man named Wu Yaoting, claiming to be from Guangdong, 30 years old, a banker, and his wife, about 20 years old, checked into room 318 on the third floor of the hotel. They usually wore beautiful clothes and behaved very extravagantly, always using a car for transportation. At 1 PM the day before yesterday, the tea boy routinely asked them if they still needed the room. At that time, Wu and his wife showed no signs of abnormality, and asked the tea boy to wait a little longer before making a decision on whether to renew the room. Around 4 PM, the tea boy went to ask again, but found that room 318 was tightly closed, and there was no response when he called. Realizing something was wrong, he managed to pry open the door, and saw that Wu and his wife had both taken poison, their faces pale. He reported it to the accountant, who called Renji Hospital, and the hospital sent an ambulance to transport Wu and his wife to the hospital for treatment. After the incident, a search of the room found no suicide note, only an empty aspirin bottle, and no other drugs. It is said that the poisoning was not deep and there was no danger to their lives. According to the hotel staff, Wu had often booked rooms there. Judging from his usual behavior, he could be considered an upper-class person. It is not known why he attempted suicide this time.</p>
<h3>Young Man's Rogue Behavior: Wealthy Family Doesn't Work, Steals Stockings and Scarf, Escapes</h3>
<p>Qingnian Pu Yongxiang, a local, 21 years old, lives at 29, Lane 62, Gansidong Road, French Concession, in a self-built house and has a lot of property, but it is all controlled by his father. Pu does not work and spends his time wandering around. Unexpectedly, at around 11 PM on September 30, Pu rode his bicycle, license number Fa Zhao Hui 2681, to Hu Zhongqin's Huamei Sock Factory at 568 Jin Shenfu Road to buy two pairs of silk stockings and some handkerchiefs, totaling four yuan and one jiao. He asked the store to send someone to collect the money. The shop owner believed him and sent apprentice Zou Shoutang to follow him. Unexpectedly, when they were passing the intersection of Alber Road and Bugao Lane, Pu snatched the goods and sped away on his bicycle. Fortunately, the apprentice remembered the number on the bicycle and reported it to the police station. Detective Zhang Bao san investigated and arrested Pu, recovered the stolen goods, and brought him to the police station. He was sent to the Criminal Court Eight of the First Special Court the day before yesterday. Shi, the prison warden, requested a postponement of the investigation. Judge Sun approved the postponement to the 9th for review.</p>
<h3>Dance Star Finals Postponed, Insufficient Number of Preliminary Round Winners</h3>
<p>The final of the Top Ten Dance Stars, organized by the Shanghai All Circles Charity Water Relief Arts Performance, was originally scheduled to be held yesterday (6th) at 3 PM at the Dahu Garden Ballroom. However, the winners of the preliminary rounds from various ballrooms failed to arrive in sufficient numbers yesterday. The St. Anna, Dahu, and Yuegong ballrooms were even absent, while dancers Li Fang and Tian Xiuhong from the Metropolitan Ballroom arrived but did not participate in the competition. After a resolution by the organizers, it was decided to reschedule the competition. The dance stars who arrived from the preliminary rounds yesterday were given exquisite cosmetics by the China Chemical Industry Company. The dance stars who will be selected in the future finals will still be awarded prizes by the Zhongxi Pharmacy, China Chemical Industry Company, and Mei Ya Silk Factory.</p>

<h3>After the Flood in Fujian Province, a Large Number of Refugees Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Over Two Hundred and Thirty Men and Women from the North</h3>
<p>At 8 AM yesterday, the Ning Shao Company's Jingjiang Wheel arrived in port, carrying more than 230 refugees, men, women, old and young, all from the North, in tattered clothes and in a sorry state. Upon receiving the news, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police to maintain order at the pier and led them to Xieqiao to stay at the Qu Zhenren Temple. They are scheduled to be sent back to their hometowns today. According to the refugees, they worked in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian. Because of the heavy floods in the autumn, the fields were flooded, so they could not stay there and left Fujian to return to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>French Concession Public Works Bureau Issues Emergency Notice to Clear Garbage, Corrects Information in Russian Newspaper</h3>
<p>Piedian, the acting general manager of the Shanghai French Concession Public Works Bureau, issued an emergency notice yesterday regarding the clearance of garbage, stating: "Notice is hereby given regarding several issues concerning the clearance of garbage in the private streets and lanes of the French Concession. There is erroneous information in the Russian weekly newspaper. This notice is hereby issued so that the public is aware. The garbage clearance regulations of this bureau, since the promulgation of the order No. 122 of the French Consul General's Office on July 30, 1932, have not been modified in any way. All garbage on the public roads in the concession is cleared by the bureau free of charge. As for the residents in the private streets and lanes, in addition to moving their garbage cans to the sidewalks next to the public roads, they enjoy the same treatment as the residents along the public roads. However, if the landlords in the private streets and lanes specifically request the bureau to clear the garbage on their property, they should pay a handling fee once every six months. The fee should be equal to four percent of the total monthly rent of all the houses in that area. Since this fee is paid every six months, it is not four percent deducted every month as reported in the Russian newspaper, but only one-sixth of four percent, which is 0.067 percent per month. This handling fee is a voluntary contract between the bureau and private individuals, and the service is exchanged for wages, so it is not a tax in nature. In particular, it cannot be confused with house tax, because its nature is completely different. This method has been implemented since 1932. This notice is hereby issued for public knowledge. Agent General: Piedian."</p>
<h3>Yu Tang Horticultural School's Ephemeral Flower Blooms Suddenly, Wilts Within Hours, People's Education Center Has Filmed It</h3>
<p>The Yu Tang Horticultural School in Shanghai County purchased an Epiphyllum oxypetalum plant from Jinling University in Nanjing two years ago. It grew ordinarily and showed no unusual signs, so it was treated casually. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this month, this flower suddenly showed signs of budding, and bloomed suddenly at about 8 PM last night, with extraordinary cold beauty. The flower shape was similar to a lotus flower, white, and as big as a palm. A faint fragrance was revealed. Unfortunately, it only appeared briefly and withered two hours later. It is said that this flower blooms only once every three thousand years, so it is not easy to see. The Yu Tang People's Education Center specially set up lights at that time and filmed the flower, so that this ephemeral flower, which only appears briefly, can be permanently enjoyed.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Society Opposes Tax Increase and the Process of its Establishment</h3>
<p>After the rickshaw industry in this city established a mutual aid society to oppose the Public Works Department's increase in vehicle taxes, it has been approved for registration by the Municipal Party Department. The organization is complete, and the society's affairs are developing vigorously. Yesterday, the secretariat of the society issued a detailed statement opposing the Public Works Department's tax increase and the process of its establishment. This matter concerns the lives of laborers and unity against external forces, so excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Annual Meeting Passes Vehicle Tax Increase</p>
<p>On April 17th of this year, the annual meeting of Western taxpayers of the Public Concession's Public Works Department passed the department's various tax schedules, resolving to increase the taxes on rickshaws and handcarts. The original tax amount for rickshaws was 10 yuan and 5 jiao, which was increased to 15 yuan and 5 jiao. The original tax amount for handcarts was 2 yuan and 5 jiao, which was increased to 5 yuan. A public notice was published, stating that it would be implemented from July 1st. Therefore, the rickshaw and handcart industries, in a time when the city's economy is declining and all industries are withering, resented that the Public Works Department did not understand the difficulties of coolie life and suddenly announced an increase in vehicle taxes, which was extremely destructive to labor, and many expressed opposition.</p>
<p>Vehicle Owners' Meeting Resolves to Oppose</p>
<p>Compared to the rickshaw and handcart industries in this city, handcarts are three-quarters more numerous than rickshaws. There are approximately 13,000 handcarts and approximately 3,000 rickshaws. Therefore, the opposition to the tax increase was more intense in the handcart industry. After repeated consultations among the industry, representatives of the vehicle owners, Shen, Zou Shisong, Chen Shixiang, and dozens of others, initiated a convening of a city-wide handcart industry representative assembly to discuss methods of opposing the Public Works Department's tax increase. On July 7th at 2:00 PM, the city-wide vehicle owner representative assembly was convened at the Nantong Shanghai Fellow Association. More than 500 people attended. After discussion, the following methods were decided: (1) Organize the Shanghai Handcart Industry Mutual Aid Society to increase strength and unite against external forces; (2) Appoint representatives to petition the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concession, requesting them to negotiate with the Public Works Department to stop the tax increase; (3) Autumn taxes will be paid after the negotiation is resolved; (4) If necessary, notify all handcart owners to bring their vehicles to the Public Works Department to petition. A vow will be made not to yield until the tax increase is revoked; (5) Issue a declaration.</p>
<p>Mutual Aid Society is Organized, Free Registration</p>
<p>Representatives Shen 1, Gao Youyu, Cheng Zhongdao, and one other person were appointed to deliver a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concession to petition. The association accepted the petition and immediately appointed a responsible person to prepare the mutual aid society and begin soliciting free registration for handcarts. After the organization of the mutual aid society was announced, all industry members flocked to join. Those who registered were extremely enthusiastic. However, the Public Works Department, even after the Chinese Taxpayers Association forwarded the letter for negotiation, had not shown any indication of a response after a long period of time. Therefore, at the first preparatory meeting of the association on July 13th at 1:00 PM, it was resolved to send another letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association, requesting a swift negotiation, and to appoint representatives to petition the Public Works Department and various Chinese directors and committee members, and to send letters to various organizations requesting that they uphold justice and provide assistance.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Promises Assistance</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th at 9:00 AM, representatives Cheng Zhongdao, Gao Youyu, Shen Yong, and seven others went to the Public Works Department and the offices of the Chinese directors and committee members to petition. Mr. He Dequi of the Public Works Department met them, while Mr. Yu Qiaqing personally received them from the Chinese directors. Both Mr. He and Mr. Yu promised to provide fair assistance. Mr. Yu Qiaqing also discussed with the representatives that old licenses could still be used before the negotiation was resolved and urged them not to panic and cause unfortunate incidents.</p>
<p>All Sectors Sympathize and are Willing to Provide Support Various organizations in this city, such as the Citizens' United Association, the Haimen Fellow Association, the Jiangbei Shanghai Business Federation, and the China National Products Manufacturers Association, have successively replied to the association, expressing sympathy and pledging to provide support. The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concession also continued to forward letters to the Public Works Department to petition on behalf of the association. At this time, the rickshaw industry also rose up to oppose the tax increase and sent representatives Chen Xiaoming, Feng Daowu, and Wang Wenyuan to the preparatory office of the association, requesting to join in order to jointly oppose the tax increase. After the third preparatory committee of the association discussed and agreed to allow them to join, the name was changed to "Shanghai Rickshaw and Handcart Mutual Aid Society." At the same time, the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concession was requested to merge the cases and negotiate with the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Police Detain Vehicles, Another Petition</p>
<p>Since the rickshaw and handcart industries jointly organized, the atmosphere of opposing the tax increase became increasingly acute, which attracted the attention of the Public Works Department. Therefore, detectives were sent to the preparatory office of the association every day to monitor the situation. The police stations even detained vehicles on the grounds that the vehicle owners were resisting the tax, and the number of detentions increased daily, causing the vehicle owners to feel uneasy in their business and creating an atmosphere of terror. Many went to the preparatory office of the association, requesting relief and protection. Therefore, on the 18th, Shen Yong, Cheng Zhongdao, Gao Youyu, and others were specially sent to lead the detained vehicle owners to the Chinese Taxpayers Association for another petition, requesting the Public Works Department to instruct the police stations to follow the instructions of Mr. He Dequi and Mr. Yu Qiaqing, allowing old licenses to be used before the negotiation was resolved and not to detain vehicles and deliberately make things difficult. Mr. Wang Xiaoxiang, chairman of the association, agreed to explain the detained vehicles to the Public Works Department on behalf of the association, and the vehicles were subsequently released by the police stations.</p>
<p>Opposition Results in Cancellation of Tax Increase</p>
<p>Since the association, during its preparatory period, had unswervingly and persistently appealed to all sectors for negotiation, the Public Works Department, at the meeting of the committee on July 19th, resolved to cancel the tax increase. This was submitted to the board meeting of the department on July 24th for adoption and approved, and a letter was sent to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concession to inform the association for reference. Therefore, the preparatory office of the association immediately notified all vehicle owners to pay the autumn vehicle tax as usual. At this point, the opposition to the tax increase was understood by the Public Works Department, achieving a satisfactory result.</p>
<p>Mutual Aid Society is Officially Established</p>
<p>Since the association was initiated and prepared, the number of industry members who applied to register as members, in less than half a month, already accounted for one-third of the city's vehicle owners. Therefore, on July 25th at 2:00 PM, a membership meeting was held at the New World on Xizang Road in the Public Concession as a temporary venue. More than 5,000 industry members attended, passed the articles of association, elected directors and supervisors, and officially announced the establishment of the society. Considering the rushed preparatory period and the tense work to oppose the Public Works Department, the licensing procedures were not completed with the Party and government agencies. Therefore, reports were submitted to the Municipal Party Department after the establishment, and the Municipal Party Department has approved the record. Looking at the success of this association in opposing the Public Works Department's tax increase, although it is said that it was due to the tireless assistance of the Chinese Taxpayers Association and various Chinese directors and committee members, it would not have been possible without the sincere unity of the industry members. Although the Public Works Department's license tax increase has been cancelled, it is difficult to guarantee that no other incidents will occur among our industry members in the future. If our rickshaw and handcart industry, with 15,000 to 16,000 households, does not have a group organization on weekdays, the industry's dispersion and lack of communication are self-evident. To be alert to the past, encourage the future, and seek improvement in the industry's living conditions and business development, the association is necessary.</p>

<h3>Accomplices in Yangshupu Road Robbery Case Detained Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>On November 30, 1933, at around 1:00 AM, Fan Shengyuan, a rent collector in Changanli, Yangshupu Road, was robbed of 389 yuan in rent money. The robbers fled in different directions. Subsequently, the police arrested the suspects Zhang Xiaodeyu, Chen Lewen, and three others, and transferred them to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, they were sentenced to imprisonment and confessed that an accomplice, Duan Rujun from Jiangbei, was at large. On the 30th of last month, Li Hongsheng, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road police station, received a report from an informant that Duan Dao (nicknamed "Little Pockmark") was wandering around Taihe Street, Yangshupu Road. He immediately went and arrested him and transferred him to the First Special Court for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the Third Criminal Court for trial. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that during the investigation, it was found that the defendant, on the afternoon of the 15th of the same month and year at 7:00 PM, colluded with a gang, held weapons, and robbed Xu Ronglan of the Zhonghua Iron Factory on Huasheng Road of 160 yuan worth of property in another case. He asked for a severe punishment according to the law. Subsequently, the victim testified about the robbery process. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he was invited by someone with a certain surname and did not enter the factory but acted as a lookout outside with a gun. He only received a few yuan afterwards and asked for leniency. Judge Jiang instructed that he be remanded in custody and await a scheduled sentence.</p>
<h3>Tao Shuzhen Sues Wu Weixin for Assault</h3>
<p>Tao Shuzhen, a former female detective of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Wu Weixin, who lives in Zhuangjia Lane, Menghua Street, were originally relatives. After Tao resigned, her finances were quite tight. Last month, Tao went to Wu's house to borrow money. For some reason, she had an argument with Wu and they grappled with each other until they reached the Wenmiao Road police station. As a result, the chief ordered Wu to lend Tao Shuzhen ten yuan and dismissed them. Tao Shuzhen then accused Wu of assault and other matters, and the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office, led by Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia, summoned the case. After verification, the defendant Wu Weixin was ordered to post a 100-yuan bond and await further instructions. A public prosecution was filed according to the law. The day before yesterday, Judge Chen Kangsun opened the court for trial. The plaintiff Tao Shuzhen appeared in court with her private prosecution attorney Shen Xingxia, requesting a private prosecution. The defendant Wu Weixin did not appear but commissioned attorney Bao Gang to appear in court to defend him. The plaintiff recounted the assault and stated that the injury to her right knee had not yet healed. She requested that the law be enforced. The defendant's lawyer stated that earlier in the police station, the defendant, feeling sorry for her at the time, lent her ten yuan. At that time, she did not mention any injuries and signed a written statement with her fingerprint. If there had been any injuries, the police station would not have easily let her go. It is clear that the defendant was being falsely accused. The defendant, who is somewhat educated and runs a respectable business, did not want to stoop to such a level but was unwilling to be falsely accused and submitted a defense, requesting that the case be dismissed. The judge stated that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the trial for another date.</p>

For regular, the literacy teacher observes the teaching situation and selects important questions and sentence-making items from the literacy textbook for the students to fill in. For the final achievement examination, the method and procedure are stipulated by this office. The main point is to use 200 of the most commonly used and not very simple characters in the textbook as the standard, and let the students try to recognize them.

<h3>Li Huitang's Courage Remains Undiminished; Hong Kong Football Team Shows Off Skills with Decisive 10-0 Victory Over Western Team Yesterday; Hong Kong Team's Strength is Solid, Performance is Impressive; 15,000 Spectators Watch with Great Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong football team, which is attending the National Games, is very strong and has a good chance of winning a championship in this year's Games. To practice their skills, they specially arranged a friendly match against the local Western team at the Shen Garden yesterday. Li Huitang, the captain of the Hong Kong team and the "King of Football," also played, after having been separated from the Shanghai people for five years. Upon hearing the news, those who admired him flocked to watch, and since noon, the roads were filled with people. Before the match even started, all four stands of the central garden were packed, with a sea of people. Later arrivals had no place to stand, and the number of people was estimated to be over 15,000, making it a rare spectacle in recent times. As a result of the match, the Hong Kong team did not expend much energy, but with a minor exhibition of their prowess, defeated the Western team with a huge score of 10-0. The first half ended 7-0. Li Huitang was as heroic as ever, scoring six goals alone. The 15,000 spectators were so impressed with his skills that they were completely convinced and shouted their satisfaction.</p>
<p>A Hundred Penalty Kicks Reveal the True King</p>
<p>How are Li Huitang's skills? This is what the general public is eager to know. Li is the soul of the entire team, leading the troops and commanding everything. Without Li, the situation might not have been the same. His dribbling skills are so wonderful that the opponent cannot figure them out, and cheers are endless. His calmness and composure in front of the goal are beyond the reach of ordinary people. Among the six goals, three were particularly ingenious. The first time, he circled around the front of the goal and entered, the goalkeeper lost sight of the left while guarding the right, and Li shot in with a curved trajectory. The second time in the second half, the goalkeeper rushed out, Li skillfully dodged and lightly lifted the ball. By the time the goalkeeper turned around to look, the ball had already entered the net, which was incredibly wonderful. His shooting is also excellent, and his power has not diminished, making a loud bang. No wonder after the game, there were still more than a thousand spectators following Li, considering it an honor to see him. After Li Huitang, the most impressive player was the left winger Zheng Jiliang, who was as light and agile as a flying swallow, a rare talent.</p>
<p>Each Person's Technique Has its Own Merits</p>
<p>In terms of individual technique, in addition to Li Huitang, who was as heroic as ever and scored six goals alone, other players such as Bao Jiaping remained calm in the face of danger and repeatedly saved difficult shots. The defender Tan Jiangbai (who is representing Guangdong in this National Games) was commendable for his bravery, and Liang Xianzhao was also flawless. Among the center backs, Li Guowei was considered the best. Huang Meishun and Liang Rongzhao were also steady and decisive. The forward "King of Football" Li Huitang, needless to say, Zheng Jiliang was brave and handsome, and Zhuo Jinshi and Li Zhaorong were promising young players with extraordinary attainments. However, Cao Guicheng's performance yesterday seemed to be relatively inferior. The Western team is still a strong team among the Western football teams in Shanghai. Yesterday, in the face of the confrontation, they were completely on the defensive. Although there were several counterattacks, they ultimately failed to achieve their wishes, and it was difficult for the ball to get close to the Hong Kong team's defense, opening a precedent for the Western team's crushing defeat in Shanghai. The magnitude of the score was beyond the team's expectations.</p>
<p>Two Goals in Three Minutes</p>
<p>As soon as the silver whistle blew, the Hong Kong team kicked off in the center line. The "King of Football" Li Huitang led the forwards and swarmed in. Li Zhaorong scored a goal, and then Zhuo Jinshi scored another one in the same way. The two goals were scored in just three minutes, which was truly amazing. Li Huitang took a free kick from 20 yards out, but failed to score. So he showed off his skills, revealing his true abilities, taking the ball alone and entering the area. As he approached the front of the goal, he somersaulted and shot into the ground. Admon, who was facing the "King of Football's" unique skills for the first time, had no way to resist and could only nod in admiration, watching the ball enter the net.</p>
<p>An Irresistible Force, Scoring Seven Goals in Total</p>
<p>Having conceded three goals in a row, the Western team desperately counterattacked, spending all their energy to finally break into the Hong Kong team's defensive area. Wuller kicked the ball, but it was blocked by goalkeeper Bao Gang. Huilu came again, and Jiaping moved his fists left and right, resolving the danger. The "King of Football" Li received a pass from Li Zhaorong, raised his iron leg, and scored another goal. This goal was clear and beautiful. Li Zhaorong came again, Li Huitang took the ball alone, broke through three barriers, and returned with a victory. Zheng Jiliang broke into the border area as if entering an uninhabited place, and Li Huitang benefited from the chaos, creating a score of 7-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>Too Big a Difference, the Battle Gradually Relaxes</p>
<p>As the second half began, the Hong Kong team, with victory in hand, and the Western team, realizing that their counterattacks were ineffective, were inevitably demoralized. Therefore, both sides were not as fiercely engaged as in the first half. After a while, Li Zhaorong received support from Huang Meishun and scored the eighth goal. Zhuo Jinshi made two wonderful shots, and Zheng Jiliang probed for treasure from across the mountain. Admon's business was booming, and he was busy welcoming and sending off, trying his best to support the team. Only then was he able to temporarily maintain a partial peace. Before long, the "King of Football" charged in with his sword, and was eventually let in. Admon rushed forward to intercept, but the "King of Football" avoided the attack, lightly kicked the ball, and calmly put the ball into the net.</p>
<p>The "King of Football's" Ingenious Skill: Shooting into an Empty Goal</p>
<p>The Western team was now desperately counterattacking, and the Hong Kong team was a little more polite, to the point where it caused goalkeeper Bao Gang to become busy, and the Hong Kong team's goal, which had been quiet for a long time, became lively again. Li Guowei saved the ball from danger, and Li Huitang immediately entered the Western team's defensive area. Admon was eager to save the ball, but Li lured him away, lightly leaving his defense, hoping to intercept Huitang's ball. Unexpectedly, Huitang came up with a plan, kicking the ball over Admon and shooting into the empty goal. The second half resulted in a score of 3-0.</p>
<p>The total result was 10-0, with the Hong Kong team winning. The lineups of both sides are listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Tan Jiangbai, Liang Xianzhao, Li Guowei, Huang Meishun, Liang Rongzhao, Zheng Jiliang, Zhuo Jinshi, Li Huitang, Li Zhaorong, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Western Team</p>

All the athletes wore black Shanxi homespun clothing, while the tennis athletes wore white pants, all of which were exceptionally simple. According to head coach Liu, the province was only able to send a portion of its athletes due to the long distance and limited funds. Even some short-distance runners in track and field who had good results were unable to come to Shanghai. The most reliable strength is the Wang sisters, Chun Jing and Chun Wei, in women's tennis, and the 10,000-meter runners.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese from the Philippines Participate in Basketball and Swimming</p>
<p>The Philippines' participation in the National Games includes two staff members, Qiu Zhongxiang and Guo Weideng, and fourteen male athletes: basketball players Yang Shufang (captain), Yang Shuhui, Su Wenxiu, Ye Wenmin, Zhan Tingrui, Shi Jiaqi, Cai Wenhuan, Ma Wenjiao, Li Xiuming, and swimmers Zheng Huaiwang (captain), Huang Eryi, Ru Haizhou, etc. Originally led by head coach Lin Zhuguang, they set off from the Philippines on the 30th of last month. However, Lin was unable to make it due to circumstances, so Guo Weideng led the team, arriving in Hong Kong on the 2nd of this month and transferring to the Canadian Empress, arriving in Shanghai at around 8:00 am yesterday. They immediately registered with the organizing committee. According to Guo, the purpose of the Philippines' participation in this National Games is not to win medals, but to learn from the strengths of other athletes and make up for their own shortcomings, so that the sports of overseas Chinese can improve in the future. The basketball team members are mostly athletes from various schools in the Philippines and have some reputation in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Java Tennis: Xu Chengji and Others Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Java is only participating in men's tennis at this National Games, represented by the famous young Chinese tennis player Xu Chengji, his younger brother Xu Chenghui, and Chen Yongzhuo.

<h3>Weary from Travel, Luggage Just Unpacked; Lin Wangsu and Chen Qi'an Suffer Setbacks Yesterday; Wang Wenzheng Defeats Chen Qi'an with Ease; Lin Wangsu Defeated by Xu Weipei Due to Lack of Energy</h3>
<p>The Malaysian Chinese tennis championship athletes Lin Wangsu, Chen Qi'an, Ruan Guoying, and Yang Longzhang, who are participating in this year's National Games, performed at the Shanghai Tennis Club yesterday. Starting at 2:00 PM, the performance was held at the Shanghai Club court on Kangti Road. The competitive interest was even stronger than the first day's performance. Lin Wangsu, the "Left Arm General," has been the Malaysian Chinese champion for many years, and Lin Baoyao and Qiu Feihai have both been defeated by him once. Chen Qi'an is a rising star. He won the Malaysian Chinese championship last year. This time he returned to the country to participate in the National Games, and he has a good chance of winning the championship. However, the two of them performed abnormally yesterday and were defeated one after another. This was because they were tired from the long journey and had just unpacked their luggage, and their energy had not yet recovered. There were four matches in total, and the competition was quite fierce. In particular, the singles match between Lin and Xu was even more exciting. From beginning to end, the situation was tense. However, there were not many spectators, only about a hundred people. This was due to the impact of the Hong Kong vs. Western team football match at Shen Garden. The results of the matches are listed below.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Defeats Chen Qi'an</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the entire Malaysian Chinese team arrived and the competition began. Chen Qi'an, the defending singles champion of Malaya, has good skills, and both his forehand and backhand are commendable. However, his serve is weak, which gives Wang Wenzheng the opportunity to volley. The reason for his defeat is also attributed to this. Wang Wenzheng's baseline shots are long, heavy, and powerful, either deep into the two corners or straight along the line, making it impossible for the opponent to save the ball. At the beginning of the first set, the two sides were evenly matched, each winning two games. After that, Wang Wenzheng cheered up and completed four games in one go, winning with a score of 6-2. Starting from the second set, Wang continued to win, going straight in and winning three cities in a row. Then Chen Qi'an took back one game, Wang led with a score of 3-1. Then Wang added three more games, taking an absolute advantage with a score of 5-1. At this time, Wang thought he had secured the victory and dealt with the game casually. Unexpectedly, Chen Qi'an responded calmly, taking advantage of the situation and winning three games in a row, falling behind by only 4-5. In the next game, Chen served, hoping to succeed in one fell swoop and tie the score. However, Wang saw that the good opportunity could not be missed again, how could he let it go? So he rose up and resisted with all his might, and indeed won the game. The result was 6-4.</p>
<p>Ruan Yang Struggles to Defeat Xu Chen</p>
<p>After the singles match, it suddenly rained, so the match was temporarily suspended. At this time, Carlsen and Defu had not yet arrived, so Xu Runpei and Chen Zhiqiang temporarily served as substitutes, competing with the Malaysian Chinese athletes Ruan Guoying and Yang Longzhang. It was difficult to tell who was better, but Yang and Ruan were slightly better. The competition was still quite fierce. The victory or defeat of a ball required ten or more exchanges, and each game required several ties before a winner could be determined. Therefore, the two sets were fought fiercely and took two hours. In the first set, Xu Chen was very strong and won with a score of 6-3. In the second set, Ruan and Yang struggled hard, responded carefully, and took it back with a score of 6-4. In the third set, Xu Chen had a very good chance of winning, taking the lead with a score of 3-0. Later, Xu Chen was anxious and flustered, and made many wild shots and frequent suicides, so Ruan and Yang chased to a tie of 3-3. Although Xu Chen had exceeded again with a score of 4-3, the good times did not last long, Ruan and Yang won three games in a row, ending the third set with a score of 6-4.</p>
<p>Xu Weipei Skillfully Takes Wangsu</p>
<p>The long-awaited singles match between Lin Wangsu and Xu Weipei followed, Lin is the champion of Malaya and Xu is the champion of Hong Kong. It was expected that the battle between the two heroes would be tense. Wangsu held the racket with his left hand and swung it freely, but because he had not been in Shanghai for a long time, was tired from the journey, and was unfamiliar with the venue, his performance could not be satisfactory. Xiao Xu performed particularly well yesterday, his shots were fast and he was good at running, and his cut ball was even more skillful, often making Wangsu sigh in vain. At the beginning of the game, Xu Weipei won two games in a row, followed by 3-1, 4-2, 5-3, leading all the way. Seeing that the opportunity was critical, Lin Wangsu tried to cheer up, worked hard to catch up, and drew long shots from both corners, applying pressure. Sure enough, he did not live up to expectations and also won three games, surpassing with a score of 6-5. In the next game, Lin served, but because his shot was weak, Xu turned it into a tie. Then Xu added two more games, winning with a score of 8-6. Starting from the second set, Lin calmly responded to the first set of defeats, taking the lead with a score of 3-1. Xu also showed his colors, tying the score at 3-3. Lin also won Xu's serve game, taking the lead again with a score of 4-3. However, Lin seemed to be exhausted, running slowly, and unable to cope with Xu's cut ball, so Xu won three games in a row, taking the second set with a score of 6-4.</p>
<p>Card Double Defeats Qiu He</p>
<p>The finale was the doubles match between Karlsen and Defu against Qiu Feihai and He Jialiu. It was already past 5:00 when the game started. Card are both veterans, with bold strokes and clear shots. Although Qiu and He are also masters, they are old and weak, their physique is weak, and the weather is late, making it difficult to distinguish between black and white, making it even more difficult to cope. Fortunately, Carlsen was only performing and dealt with it perfunctorily, not exerting all his strength, otherwise Qiu and He would not have been able to withstand the attack. At the beginning of the first set, He failed to serve, and Card won in a row, creating a situation of 4-1. Qiu and He chased up two games, and Card returned the respect in the same way, ending with a score of 6-3. In the second set, Qiu and He tried their best to fight, once taking the lead with scores of 2-1, 3-2, and 4-3. Card tied the score at 4-4, and then each added one game to make it 5-5. At this time, the sky was dark, so the match was stopped.</p>

It is now known that there is also a Malaysian Chinese tourist group of 15 people who came to Shanghai at the same time, led by Miss Mabei Wong, an employee of the China Travel Service in Singapore. This time, they came entirely for sightseeing and to visit the National Games. The Shanghai General Office of the China Travel Service believes that the Malaysian Chinese athletes are participating for the first time and their enthusiastic emotions are admirable. It is planned to hold a grand tea party in the near future to express welcome. However, the date is still being negotiated, and the location is probably at the Delmont Hotel.</p>
<h3>National Games Hires Mei Lanfang to Perform; There Will Be Entertainment Every Night from the 11th to the 19th; Movie Stars Hu Die and Others Will Also Appear on Stage, Making Every Night Exciting</h3>
<p>The 12th Standing Committee Meeting of the 6th National Games decided to organize an Entertainment Preparatory Committee and hired Li Dachao, Chen Xiangtao, Chu Minyi, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Jiang Xiangqing, Lu Shoulian, He Tingran, Zhou Jianyun, and Hong Yanbin as members. Li Dachao was elected as chairman. The National Games Organizing Committee sent letters of appointment. Yesterday at 7:00 PM, the Preparatory Committee convened a meeting of various committees on the 9th floor of the YMCA in Baxianqiao to discuss the overall direction of the entertainment. Those present included Hong Yanbin, Jiang Xiangqing, Wang Xiaolai (representing Jiang Junyi), Lu Shoulian, Chen Xiangtao (representing Yuan Zengyu), Chu Minyi (representing Tian Shucheng), Du Yuesheng (representing Hong Yanbin), Li Dachao, and Zhou Jianyun. Chairman Li Dachao recorded the meeting.</p>
<p>The chairman reported that the National Games will open on Double Ten Festival and close on the 20th. It will be held in the sports field in the city center. Athletes from various provinces and overseas Chinese are very enthusiastic to participate, with a total of 38 units. The National Games specially proposed the organization of an entertainment preparatory committee at the 12th Standing Committee Meeting and hired everyone to assist. Taking advantage of spare time, various entertainment activities will be organized to make all athletes recognize various entertainment activities and become interested in them for entertainment purposes. Those who are responsible for performing entertainment activities will do their duty. If expenses are required, they will be borne by each group. Please give your opinions. Special items for discussion: (1) It is scheduled to perform from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM every night from the 11th to the 19th. The entertainment is divided into Peking Opera, drama, film, song and dance music, and magic. (2) The dates for performing entertainment: 11th - music (National Conservatory of Music and Datong Music Society, Li Dachao is responsible), 12th - Peking Opera (Shanghai amateurs, Hong Yanbin is responsible), 13th - film (Zhou Jianyun is responsible), 14th - song and dance (movie stars, Hong Yanbin and Zhou Jianyun are responsible), 15th - magic (Hong Yanbin is responsible), 16th - Peking Opera (Mei Lanfang, Hong Yanbin is responsible), 17th - performance (Lu Shoulian is responsible), 18th - film (Zhou Jianyun is responsible), 19th - drama (Xishi Musical Theatre, Shanghai Theatre Academy).

(4) Hong Yanbin, Jiang Xiangqing, and Li Dachao are responsible for planning and arrangement. (5) Jiang Xiangqing and Li Dachao are responsible for liaising with the National Games Organizing Committee for admission.</p>
<p>It is said that the repertoire is very exciting and completely voluntary. Dr. Mei Lanfang is currently singing charity operas for disaster relief at the Great Golden Theater. He originally had no time and energy to help the National Games. However, Dr. Mei decided to take time out of his busy schedule to perform his masterpiece. His enthusiasm is admirable, and the enthusiastic support of Committee Member Du Yuesheng and others is even more admirable. As for the songs and dances of movie stars, all the first-class stars such as Hu Die, Xu Lai, and Wang Renmei will be on stage. The 2,700 athletes from 38 units at home and abroad are overjoyed when they hear the news. The organizing committee is deeply grateful.</p>

<h3>National Games Propaganda and Transportation; The Central News Agency Sets Up a Radio Station</h3>
<p>At this National Games, in view of the lack of unity in past conference propaganda, the strength of the propaganda group has been strengthened to seek accuracy and speed in transmitting conference news. Regarding news, the organizing committee has fully authorized the Central News Agency to use the radio station of the agency to broadcast various news at any time and transmit it to various places at home and abroad. The agency also has several ultra-shortwave radios installed in various venues of the conference to broadcast the competition situation at any time. This city fully supplies various newspapers with hard and soft news. As for photos, Wang Kai Photo Studio and International News Agency are responsible for supplying them. The Central Film Studio is responsible for handling the films.</p>
<p>Installation of Telephones Inside and Outside the Venue Completed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to quickly communicate information inside and outside the venue for the 6th National Games, which is scheduled to open in the city center on Double Ten Festival this year, actively prepared and carried out the installation of telephones for internal communication, telephones for internal and external communication, public telephones, and direct telephones last month. Since the bureau ordered workers to rush to install them day and night, all the projects have been completed. Yesterday, it started to communicate, and the sound was unusually clear.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Education Fee Will Be Issued for One Month</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School, Primary School, and Social Education Organization's September expenditure of 290,000 yuan, plus the implementation of the Yi Jiao (free compulsory education) expenditure (Jiangsu's Yi Jiao regulations stipulate an annual fee of 100,000 yuan and a monthly expenditure of 8,000 yuan) and temporary expenses, will require a total of more than 310,000 yuan this time. It is reported that the payment notice for the September expenditure and other expenses to be issued this time has been signed by the education fee audit committee and is now being sent to the Jiangsu Audit Office for detailed review. The Jiangsu Education Treasury has received 256,000 yuan.

After being submitted to the Provincial Government Committee Meeting, it was decided to approve the allocation of 110,000 yuan for Yi Jiao expenses from the general reserve fund item in this year's provincial expenditure budget. However, due to the provincial treasury's deficit, it is difficult to raise this amount of expenditure at one time. The Ministry of Finance was also ordered to allocate 20,000 yuan first within a few days for application. In the future, it will be allocated successively on schedule to effectively handle it. The Ministry of Education has been informed of the situation.</p>

<h3>Little Boy (68)</h3>
<p>— Original by American author Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"I don't care where I go or how long I stay, but I'll be damned if I come back," Don said with a burst of anger, then went to pack his things, all of which had originally been given to him by Mr.裴.</p>
<p>This was also his farewell speech to the children, because they were discussing the matter in the barn when he came down. He didn't want Ned to call them. A carriage stopped at the door, and Mrs. Pei went out to speak to Don. The sadness on her face broke his heart, so he gently asked:</p>
<p>"May I see Tommy one more time?"</p>
<p>"Of course; go in and kiss him. He'll be very sad not to see his Don."</p>
<p>He bent over the cradle, and the little face lit up as soon as it saw him. No one saw the anxious look in Don's own eyes. At the same time, he heard Mrs. Pei pleading:</p>
<p>"Can't we give this poor child another chance, Mr. Pei?" Mr. Pei then replied in his decisive tone:</p>
<p>"My dear, this isn't the best way. Let him stay somewhere harmless and beneficial to himself for a while, and he'll be back soon, you'll see."</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Ji Ren)</p>
<p>"Only women and petty people are difficult to nurture. If you get close to them, they become disrespectful; if you keep them at a distance, they resent you." As someone with limited experience of the world, I didn't fully understand the weight of these "sage words" at first. However, in recent years, I've traveled around and had more opportunities to interact with society. I've come to believe that Confucius's remarks, though separated by thousands of years, remain unchanged. Indeed, they are a "definitive statement." I ask you: Aren't the actions of women and petty people something that cannot be completely eradicated from society? Would society cease to be society without such people? I dare to ask those who are wise.</p>
<p>"People who are helped don't leave, but ghosts run straight away." These are two common sayings. One must be careful in choosing friends. People with responsibility and those unwilling to fall behind should have a kind of "knowing people" and "knowing talent" wisdom. Insight is essential.</p>
<p>"Treading on thin ice" is the style of a humble gentleman. Nowadays, once people achieve success, they often have a sense of "I am the only one worthy" and "who but me." One should know that a tall tree catches the wind. If there's a mistake one day, you'll realize that the sails were set too high, and the danger is even greater than anything else.</p>
<p>Those born into poverty often achieve great success and become great figures.</p>
<p>Friends who are accustomed to "stealing chickens and cutting threads" will start to suspect that others are also learning their "stealing chickens and cutting threads" ways once they gain power. Therefore, they constantly guard against others, fearing that it's not thorough enough. However, everyone has their own "character" and their own "background." Wasting effort is futile and only invites boredom. Why bother?</p>
<h3>General Mobilization Order</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Hearing the word "mobilization" makes my heart leap, because it's like a torch burning forward on the front lines of war. No matter how solemn the League of Nations in Geneva, a peace organization, it's immediately shattered, and many alliances are destroyed in an instant. Alas! Moreover, the word "total" and "order" are added above and below "mobilization." This shows that the entire nation is united in attacking the enemy, and no one can escape this order. So, what's frightening is "mobilization," and what's most terrifying is "general mobilization order."</p>
<p>You! It's heard that both sides have issued a "general mobilization order," and everyone is preparing to attack East Africa? This war, compared to the First European War twenty years ago, has many more advanced weapons. Now, they're all going to be used to turn Abyssinia into a battlefield and test them out first. Although it's impossible to predict which country will win and which will lose, the old saying "war is fierce and dangerous" is something that no one can deny. Moreover, it's said that everything in terms of military equipment is just a facade. Once those scientifically secret inventions are unleashed in the midst of a desperate battle between the two armies, humph! A death ray will be released, and no matter how strong the city or defensive structure, it will immediately become ineffective. Even a group of fighter planes in the sky, like flying mosquitoes, will turn into nothing. You! Don't you think this kind of war is a great disaster for the world and humanity?</p>
<p>Alas, peace! peace! After shouting for many years, it's given up with a "general mobilization order." So, any country that constantly adopts an attitude of appeasement, fearing to fight with the enemy, is always suffering from cowardice. However, if someone likes to start trouble, willingly becoming the leader of the war, and believes that they are invincible, then this is not really a righteous war with a "just cause." You! Look at Napoleon, who held the Bible in his left hand and the sword in his right. Although he won repeatedly and dominated the world, alas! In the end, he was imprisoned on the island of Saint Helena. I ask you, where did he actually gain victory?</p>
<h3>Miss Sausage</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>This column once published an article about "Miss Chocolate." Unexpectedly, things in the world are never unique. Near a certain university, there is a "Miss Sausage," which translated means "Sausage Lady."</p>
<p>Near that university, there are a total of three small Western restaurants. Miss Sausage is the wife of the owner of one of these three small Western restaurants. Although this small Western restaurant, like the other two, has a name and an enamel sign, the university students always say when they go to this Western restaurant, "Let's go to Miss Sausage's place."</p>
<p>Miss Sausage is the owner's second wife, only twenty-one or two years old. She is neither tall nor short, neither fat nor thin. She has a dimple on her left cheek and a gray mole the size of a bedbug on her right cheek. So, the university students all admit that her dimple is like that of a certain star, and her gray mole is like that of a certain star.</p>
<p>She treats customers very attentively, making them feel as comfortable as they are at home. She can say the English names of various dishes, especially the word "sausage," which she pronounces fluently, so she became "Miss Sausage."</p>
<p>Each meal, there are about a hundred customers under Miss Sausage's hospitality. Because Miss Sausage's hospitality is attentive, the small tips are given a lot. So Miss Sausage always has her hair permed, wears high heels, and is very modern.</p>
<p>Among the three Western restaurants, Miss Sausage's is the smallest, but six or seven out of ten of the diners in that university are her customers. The other two "lower prices," "offer credit," and "also use female waitresses," but Miss Sausage's business is not affected at all.</p>
<p>Recently, around three or four o'clock in the afternoon, the university students have been popularizing a slogan, "Let's go to Miss Sausage's place for milk coffee!"</p>
<h3>Designs for the People of the Disaster Area</h3>

<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Struggling to See the Beloved Grandson, Crying Together, Recalling the Past in a Year of Famine, Sowing Wheat to Invite Disaster</p>
<p>Shi Lian scratched his head and said with a smile, "I have something very difficult. Just now I went to this back door and saw an old woman sitting under the opposite door frame, about to die. I thought, that must be Mr. Jia's new wife's grandmother. When I saw it, I naturally had to tell them." The tea attendant laughed, "Then why don't you tell them?" Li Shi Lian said, "I'm afraid that the new wife will feel bad when she hears it." The tea attendant laughed, "If she feels bad, let Mr. Jia feel sorry for her, what are you worried about, Mr. Li?" The tea attendant said, walking forward, Li Shi Lian grabbed him and asked, "In your Xi'an city, are there any people who borrow illness to extort money?" The tea attendant said, "Where did you hear that? I haven't heard of it." He didn't answer completely, and he was already far away. Shi Lian thought, "That's bad, he's already gone to the front, he must have told her everything." Maybe old Jia himself will come to the back to take a look. Even if the old woman of the Zhu family is trying to extort money from me by dying, I'm not afraid of him with her grandson-in-law present. Moreover, the tea attendant said that there is no such thing in Xi'an city. Thinking this way, it seems that it is still better to go to the back door to take a look. Fortunately, there is still a street separating us from the opposite door. Even if she wants to extort money from me, she can't." Thinking this way, he turned around and went to the back door again. From afar, he saw Yue Ying's mother and that Hu sister-in-law, all sitting on the door frame. The old woman was leaning against her daughter-in-law, still slightly opening her eyes, she was definitely not dead. His daughter-in-law and Hu sister-in-law were holding a bowl of water, giving her a drink. (334)</p>
<h3>The Misty Records of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Especially our Empress Dowager, she is usually very careful to decorate her appearance, and she changes her clothes very diligently. I think she will definitely not be willing to let her body be the only place to hide dirt and filth. But at first, I couldn't guess how her bathing problem was solved.</p>
<p>Now let me first say how I solved it myself? Fortunately, the Empress Dowager treated us specially. Although the first few female officials who entered all lived together in a side hall behind the Empress Dowager's bedroom, six people lived together, for the convenience of the Empress Dowager's calling. But when we entered, the Empress Dowager knew that we would never want to live so crowded. Therefore, not only did she specially designate two small houses for us in the palace, but also in the Summer Palace, we also had separate residences. With this convenience, we can buy our own bathing equipment, but it can't be very complete. I just sent a eunuch to my home to send a letter. In less than five or six days, my father entrusted someone to bring us a wooden tub that looked a bit like a Western-style bathtub, and the wood used was very light, so it was not difficult to move. This solved the bathing problem for us sisters.</p>
<p>Next, let me tell you about the Empress Dowager's bathing method.</p>
<p>A few days later, one night, a female official suddenly came to inform me and say: tonight the Empress Dowager is going to take a bath again. Later I finally knew that the Empress Dowager was not only not someone who never bathed all year round, but also had to take a bath every few days, just like she had to apply egg white and camellia dew every night, which was the same unchangeable routine. —Today it is my turn to be on duty, so I must hurry up to serve.

<h3>From the Town God Temple to the Inner Garden</h3>
<p>— Huo Yunming</p>
<p>Everyone who has lived in Shanghai for a long time knows the Town God Temple in Xiaodongdou. Everyone who knows the Town God Temple also knows the Yu Garden behind the temple. Those who grew up nearby, who go to the Huxin Pavilion or Chunfeng Deyi Building for tea at dawn, and meet acquaintances on the road, will ask, "Where are you going?" His answer is: "Going to drink tea in the garden!" Replacing "Yu Garden" with the two words "in the garden" has almost become a common and well-known name.</p>
<p>Upper-class Chinese people have their own Yiyuan dog racing track, Jai Alai court, and dance halls with crystal floors. Shouldn't ordinary people be allowed to sneak into the Town God Temple to find weak entertainment? The brass ring emits a crystal light, which looks no different from real gold. Sipping a bowl of rich, glutinous rice balls, the taste is not inferior to international royal meals and Sullivan's; leaning on the red granite of the Nine-Bend Corridor, leisurely admiring the turtles in the thick green ripples, the style is no less elegant than gazing and pondering on the high floor of the Cathay Hotel. But isn't there also bitter tears in here? Moreover, in the magnificent temple supported by steel and cement, there are statues of the Ming Dynasty dressed with official garments and hats, worshiped by women who are scented with Parisian perfume and young men in stylish suits; isn't this a reflection of national education? However, people criticize the Town God Temple, thinking that it is a recreational area for the masses, gathering a dissolute group every day! They never think that in the Town God Temple, in addition to smoking opium, idle eating, worshiping, and wandering around, there are also schools, hospitals, libraries, public security bureaus, and administrative organs managing the Town God Temple and Yu Garden! People only see the bad side, only curse the back of the mirror for not shining, but they are unwilling to run to the front and take a look at the true essence of the Town God Temple. Just looking at how the roads and sanitation facilities are, is too unfair! What's more, the Lingtai Inner Garden has already been opened, and following the Cui Xiu Hall, famous for its large rockery, it is said that it will also be open to the public on the ninth day of the lunar month.</p>
<p>Here, let me first talk about the story of the Inner Garden and others. Because recently I saw articles describing the Inner Garden, often lumping it together with the large rockery of Cui Xiu Hall. How can they not know that Cui Xiu Hall is called "West Garden," while the Inner Garden is called "East Garden"? According to research, Yu Garden was originally the private residence of Pan Yunduan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Punishment. The Shanghai County Chronicle says that the garden base has a total of thirty-six acres, eight fen, nine li, and one hao. However, Qiao Zhongwu's record says, "The site is about seventeen acres, south to the temple shrine, the northwest sides are surrounded by walls; the east is Tonghe; a garden gate is opened in the middle..." But from today's point of view, even if the old school grounds west of Small World, the Five Old Peaks to the north (inside Xinbeimen Street), and Anren Street to the east are included, it is definitely not as large as seventeen acres of land, let alone thirty acres, several fen, and several li. After Yu Garden was destroyed, some local people still built gardens on its original site, east of the temple shrine, which was called the "East Garden," constructed in the forty-eighth year of Kangxi, and also known as the "Inner Garden." It used to be managed by the money shop industry. The "West Garden" of the large rockery was built in the twenty-fifth year of Qianlong. In the Inner Garden, the ponds and rockeries are arranged very exquisitely. The rockeries are also more delicate than those in Cui Xiu Hall. Walking up to the left from the small pavilion of "Another World," and finishing the winding stone steps, there is a pavilion, located on a brick hill, where you can have tea or play chess. If you have the interest to "go up another level," you can rely on it to look down on the houses of thousands of families in the city. Exiting the pavilion and going south, there is a row of vermilion painted long houses, comfortable and quiet. During the Republic of China, the Shanghai Municipal Annals Museum used to work there. Originally, from these houses, you could reach the "Small Lingtai" in the southwest corner, but now it is closed, probably used by the gardener as a bedroom? I remember Cao Yishi had a poem: "Red atmosphere and black shadows have been there for years, relying on climbing the terrace to sweep them away." Looking at the bandits in Western Sichuan and the remnant borders in the Northeast, there is no place to mourn, it is really pitiful.</p>
<p>The Inner Garden's encircling walls are all engraved with mud dragons. The dragon's heads are directly immersed in the pool water. It is said that the dragon has nine heads, but only six or seven can be found. In fact, it is a nonsense rumor. The most elegant place in the garden is in a concave corridor on the east side of the main hall, which happens to embrace the pool. A cluster of green bamboo grows out of the reef pile. If you can sit there in the drizzling rain at dusk and listen to the whisper of late autumn, you will definitely understand the beauty of the Inner Garden and the stillness of the Inner Garden.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Path to Improving China's Economy</h3>
<p>— Yu Huancheng</p>
<p>Liu An: This article is a lecture manuscript by Mr. Huancheng at Fudan University and Great China University. There are varying opinions on the path to improving China's economy. Mr. Huancheng presents his thoughts of over ten years, expressing them in this article, advocating for integrating industry into agriculture. This is undoubtedly extraordinary, and scholars at home and abroad will surely gain a new interest in research from this article. However, due to the limited space in this publication, the full text is over ten thousand words, which cannot be completed in one issue. The remainder will be published in installments.</p>
<p>I. Reflections of Recent Years</p>
<p>What I am talking about today is what methods should be used to improve China's economy? I dare not say transform, only improve, because transformation requires a complete overhaul to be worthy of the word "transform," while improvement implies partial and temporary progress; however, it also requires the word "change."</p>
<p>Although it is called improvement, it seems more stable and accommodating. However, this issue is still very important and complex. What I am talking about today is naturally not a doctrine, nor a system; but rather a reflection that has arisen from what I have seen and heard in recent years. I have held this reflection for almost ten years, but it has not yet formed a system, nor have I collected various materials, so I have not written this reflection into an article, nor have I spoken about it in detail to anyone. Now, China's economic situation is deteriorating day by day, almost reaching a dead end. From top to bottom, the call for economic transformation is growing louder day by day, creating the impression that it is impossible to move forward without change. In this trend, I naturally cannot help but want to reveal my reflections of the past ten years for my fellow students to study together.</p>
<p>Where did my reflections originate? About eleven or twelve years ago, I went to see the Daye Iron Mine. There were hundreds of workers digging ore sand. I asked the manager, "Where do the workers come from?" The manager replied, "These are all farmers from nearby areas. There are fewer workers during the busy farming season, and more during the slack season. The nearby villages benefit a lot from the iron mine." I realized that mining was originally a kind of sideline for farmers. Why are there no workers to recruit other than farmers? Why do farmers not have other better sidelines than mining? Why do they still do farm work during the busy season, instead of making mining a profession? This was the first time I had a doubtful reflection.</p>
<p>About five or six years ago, I had a friend named Wang, who had been dealing in flour mill machinery since flour mills started being established in China. He told me, "This time I came back from Shandong, and the small flour mills in Shandong are developing tremendously. Since the advent of diesel engines, a small flour mill can be set up with a few thousand or ten thousand yuan. The local wheat is milled into flour locally, making buying and selling convenient and saving transportation costs, so they can often earn a bit. There are many machine flour mills in the villages." At that time, I realized that flour mills could be set up in the villages, so why couldn't other factories be set up in the villages? Village flour milling can switch to small machines, so why can't other agricultural sidelines and village handicrafts be mechanized? This was the second time I had the reflection of combining agriculture and industry, and village factories.</p>
<p>Recently, three or four years ago, my friend Gao Jiansi invited me to visit the People's Education Institute in Wuxi. Seeing its achievements in improving rural areas, training citizens, literacy education, and cooperative sales, I also realized that farmers are not stubborn and foolish. As long as someone promotes and trains them, they will make progress by leaps and bounds. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to visit Ding County, Zouping, Nanzhao, and other places that are improving rural areas, so I could have gained more insights. This was the third time I had the reflection that farmers can accomplish great things.</p>
<p>Combining these reflections and casually consulting some newspapers and books, I felt that China's economy has its own stance. To improve China's economy, there is a clear and open path. I thought, questioned, and answered myself. In the past two or three years, I have almost had a draft of a concrete plan in my mind, which is what I am going to talk about today. In reality, it is still just a reflection. However, I have combined my previous reflections and tentatively proposed some ideas.</p>
<p>Now we must enter the main text. If we want to improve China's economy, we must first understand what kind of object China's economy is. For example, a doctor treating a disease must first recognize what the disease is, and what the patient's physical condition is, before prescribing medicine. It is not copying a universal panacea that can be applied casually, nor is it that the old and young, men and women, strong and weak, can all be treated with the same prescription. Speaking of prescriptions for treating China's economy, there are really too many! Free trade, protectionist policies, agriculturalism, industrialization, up to the most modern controlled economy, planned economy, all can be said to be reasonable. Talking about imitating other countries! England completed its industrial development through free trade, Germany achieved industrial revitalization through protective tariffs; the countries of the Americas have achieved national prosperity by using foreign capital. There have already been many precedents in history. Recently, such as Soviet Russia's Five-Year Plan, Italy's corporatist system, and even Denmark's rural cooperation, and England's Guild socialism, have been praised by many people, and advocated by many people. Which one is good in the end? It is confusing, and there is a sense of being lost and not knowing where to go. I think various theories and systems of various countries are all good, and they are all not good. Good or not, depends on whether it suits the object of our country. If it suits, it is good, if it doesn't suit, it is not good. If there is no theory or system that can be completely and perfectly applied like a printed plate, we must also deliberate on what to take and what to discard, combine various methods, or come up with new ideas to handle it. The so-called "the miracle of application lies in the mind," it is not tracing every detail and copying imitations that can be done well and handled properly.</p>
<p>Speaking of the object of our country's economy, the talk becomes complicated. Marxist scholars are arguing about what period and what stage? Feudal! Pre-capitalist! Capitalist! They have been arguing for a long time, and they still can't figure it out clearly. I am an outsider, and I am even more confused. Now, let's not use these general and all-encompassing names for the time being, and just list a few special phenomena in fact, which may be easier to understand. Let's just talk about the facts.</p>
<p>II. The Economy of the Family System or Patriarchal Society</p>
<p>The most obvious fact is that the vast majority of our country, or even the entire country, is the economy of the family system; it can also be said to be the economy of the patriarchal society. In most villages, people live in clans, such as a certain family village or a certain family manor, which is everywhere. Even in Shanghai, there are still traces of Tangjiazhai and Gujialong. Among those who live together, prosperous families have ancestral halls, and ancestral halls have clan rules. The most important is ancestor worship, followed by helping clansmen; there are clan estates, clan schools, and public property of the clan awarded to those who have achieved honor. The family is the center of life for Chinese people. In terms of family ethics, the family is important, and the individual is light. In terms of family concepts, one only knows the family, and does not know the country. According to modern new theories, this is the poison of feudalism. However, the vast majority of people in the country, especially farmers, are immersed in the river of family love, deeply rooted and difficult to eradicate. Despite the shouts of overthrowing the old ethics and breaking the old morality in several major cities; and several rounds of people bravely attacking the Confucius shop, attacking once, twice, three times, attacking endlessly; in fact, there are also fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, suing each other, and it seems that family ethics and family concepts have been shaken by the new trend. However, this is only the current situation in a few major cities; if we compare the population of these major cities with the national population, we will feel that the shaking power of the new trend is not enough to even scratch the surface. The population table of each city is listed below: (According to the Twenty-Fourth Year of the Shen Bao Almanac)</p>
<p>Nanjing City 726,131 Hangzhou City 550,990</p>
<p>Shanghai City 3,480,018 Qingdao City 451,184</p>
<p>Beiping City 1,516,378 Chengdu City 440,859</p>
<p>Guangzhou City 1,222,583 Chongqing City 281,271</p>
<p>Tianjin City 1,399,146 Shantou City 208,608</p>
<p>Hankou City 772,834 Wuhu City 150,411</p>
<p>Changsha City 408,005</p>
<p>The above thirteen urban areas, including the suburban population, are still less than 12 million people. Adding the more industrialized and commercial areas in the south such as Xiamen, Fuzhou, and the central region such as Ningbo, Wuxi, Suzhou, Yangzhou, and the northern region such as Jinan, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Baotou, etc., about 3.4 million people, the total is no more than 15.6 million. According to the national population of over 430 million, it is still less than 4 percent. The number is already too small, not to mention that in these more industrialized and commercial cities, there are only a very small number of new intellectuals, and unrestrained young men and women, who jump out of the family circle and act on their own. On the other hand, 80 or 90 percent still live family lives, keeping family customs; although they live in cities, they have not been affected by individualism, nationalism, or socialism. It can be said that the entire country is within the scope of the family. Therefore, the economy cannot be separated from the economy of the family system.</p>
<p>What are the economic phenomena of the family system? Mr. Qianxi explained it very clearly in "China's New Economic Policy." I quote it as follows: "Europeans and Americans value the concept of the state, and undervalue the concept of the family; Chinese individuals value the concept of the family, and undervalue the concept of the state. The scope of the family also varies in size. In Europe and America, the rights and obligations of individual property related to the family are mostly limited to spouses; in China, the rights and obligations of individual property related to the family, direct relatives, collateral relatives, and even relatives and friends, all have a legal, customary, and moral relationship of property rights and obligations. (Omission) The status of Europeans and Americans in society is very different from the status of Chinese people in society. Europeans and Americans are responsible to the state and individuals in society; Chinese people are responsible to the state and individuals in society, and must also bear a broad family responsibility. In summary, the spirit of the European and American social structure is to make all members powerful, and to minimize the scope of the powerless members; the spirit of the Chinese social structure is to make all members, both powerful and powerless, coexist, and to preserve the habit of powerless members relying on the existence of powerful members. Therefore, whether they are employed or unemployed, property owners or propertyless, their economic environments are absolutely different in Europe and America and in China. (Omission) European and American laws and customs are mainly focused on wealth accumulation; Chinese laws and customs are mainly focused on wealth equalization." This passage reveals the economic reality of China's thousands of years of tradition, truly seeing the big picture and revealing the minute details. Compared to those who use the two words "overthrow" and "establish" to obliterate everything, it is not the same. The effect of the family system economy is entirely focused on compassion and harmony (see the Rites of Zhou). Frankly speaking, it is that people with money have to bear the responsibility of helping poor relatives. Mr. Qianxi therefore said that wealth equalization is the main focus. However, although it is wealth equalization, it only equalizes to people with blood ties, and not to the entire society; "love relatives and be benevolent to the people, be benevolent to the people and love things," (see Mencius,) there is a difference.</p>
<p>The advantages of the family system economy are: (1) Reducing the difference between the rich and the poor. (2) Making people love their clans and hometowns. (3) Making customs simple and honest, the so-called "carefully pursuing the distant ancestors, and the people's morality will return to honesty," (see the Analects.) The disadvantages are that it is incompatible with various new trends, especially capitalism. Because capitalism focuses on the development of individual abilities, and requires considerable abilities to do considerable things. The family system both restricts individuals and makes their property easy to disperse, and when doing things and employing people, relatives and fellow villagers are entangled and unclear, often making those who do things procrastinate and reduce efficiency. A certain industrial magnate has a very large business, but the personnel he employs are either relatives or clansmen. In the office, the conversation is all in the same local accent, and the result is inevitably failure. This is not because the abilities of a certain magnate are insufficient, but because it is putting new wine in old bottles. The family system is incompatible with capitalism. For decades, capitalist-style new industries have been promoted in major commercial ports, but the result has not created new capital, but has lost more old capital. Naturally, there are other important reasons, and the family system is certainly a spreader of plague for capitalism.</p>
<p>Since the family system contains the meaning of wealth equalization, "the wealthy are not benevolent, and the benevolent are not wealthy!" (see Mencius) "Alas for the rich! Pity the poor and lonely," (see the Book of Songs) wealth has always been a moral concept in the family system that is not very much admired. Therefore, socialism is easier to approach than capitalism. However, collective socialism is also feared to be incompatible. I think that warm, reformed, socialism, using cooperative methods, can combine and dissolve material civilization into the family system. Paying attention to both production and distribution at the same time may be more possible. Or it can achieve a path of less effort and more success, less sacrifice and greater efficiency.</p>
<p>III. The Historical Nature of Emphasis on Agriculture and the Phenomenon of the Suffering of Farmers Who Account for the Largest Proportion of the National Population</p>
<p>"Agriculture is the fundamental wealth, and industry and commerce are the secondary wealth." This is the traditional economic thought of China for thousands of years since the Zhou and Qin dynasties. From Hou Ji, Duke Zhou, Guan Zhong, Shang Yang, Jia Yi, Chao Cuo, all the way to Gu Tinglin and Zhang Yangyuan of the former Qing Dynasty, it has been passed down without any changes. Those who hold different opinions are only the smallest minority (such as Huang Lizhou's saying that "all are fundamental"), and have no influence on society. Emperors and local officials often personally plowed the land during the Spring Festival, and the ceremony was extremely grand (much more grand than planting trees on Arbor Day now). When we were young, we often heard the saying "passing down the family through farming and reading." Farming and reading were both noble occupations. Until modern times, returning to the fields is still a fashionable phrase on the lips of generals and bureaucrats. In addition to untitled poems (romantic love) and social poems, most of Chinese literature is pastoral literature, either elaborating on the hardships of farmers or singing the joys of rural life. In general, the psychology of the past has been that, in terms of a country, agriculture is the fundamental wealth of the country; in terms of individuals, agriculture is the most noble life. The concept of emphasizing agriculture has not been changed or abandoned from history to today. However, on the one hand, despite the emphasis on agriculture, there are many elegant and beautiful texts; on the other hand, the farmers are extremely poor. At best, they can only live a stable minimum life. Mencius said, "In good years, they suffer all their lives, and in bad years, they cannot avoid death." Until we see it, it is still the case. It cannot be said that this is a very contradictory phenomenon. In recent years, soldiers and bandits have risen one after another, and floods and droughts have occurred intermittently. You often see in newspapers the facts of eating grass roots, swallowing tree bark, digging Guanyin powder, refugees fleeing famine, families committing suicide or starving to death. These are all the circumstances of the largest number of farmers in a country that claims to value agriculture, struggling to live in an environment where they cannot live. Speaking of it, it is really tragic! It is really painful! The farmers, who account for 82-83 percent of the national population, are mired in such a miserable situation, even if a dozen or so major cities are created as golden paradises and fairy lands, how much can they do to remedy the national economy? Can a small number of industries and businesses still prosper if the majority of farmers are so miserable? Who will consume the manufactured goods and who will buy the goods transported by merchants? Talking about the improvement of China's economy, without thinking about the largest number of most miserable farmers, is always "putting the cart before the horse," and there is no good in it.</p>
<p>IV. The Status of a Semi-Colony and the Complex Phenomenon of the New and the Old</p>
<p>Advanced countries have many ways to improve their economies. However, they mostly acquire the land of others to supply their colonies. In our country, others colonize our own land. This crucial point is just the opposite. The economies of colonized and colonized countries are fundamentally different. Can we use the entire protectionist policy of Germany? Can we, like England, ostensibly claim free trade, but secretly exploit colonies to enrich ourselves? Can we do what the countries of the Americas do, freely absorbing foreign capital to increase production? Can we follow the example of the majority of modern countries, even the smallest free cities, in managing exchange rates and distributing imports? This cannot be done, and that cannot be done. Commercial treaties and concessions bind us so that we cannot move. In addition to unequal treaties, there are also unilateral agreements imposed by powerful neighbors; in addition to concessions, there are also forced demilitarized zones. Others compete to build tariff barriers, but we insist on reducing taxes; others compete to protect their factories, but we make factories run by others better than our own factories. Originally, the status of a semi-colony is quickly rising to a full colony. Many things outside of the economy make it impossible to start improving the economy. If imperialism cannot be defeated politically, the economy can only bow its head and listen to its aggression. When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, where can we find a way out?</p>
<p>The semi-colonial status has already made the economy have no way to go. There is another difficulty: our country is in a transitional period, and things from thousands of years ago are mixed with modern things. Airplanes are flying in the sky, and on the ground, carters are driving their carts with a pair of horses, just like when Confucius traveled around the states, one cart and two horses, it is still the same. Conflicting and uncoordinated phenomena are everywhere in society. When various countries first changed to machines, a certain number of unemployed people naturally occurred. Fortunately, they have colonies and uncivilized people to develop sales channels; therefore, emerging industries are rising vigorously. Not only is it easy for the unemployed to find jobs, but their lives are also particularly prosperous, and conflicts will naturally not last long. Our country is too backward. The light industry that once developed cannot resist foreign goods, but it is more than enough to defeat local goods. In the end, it was defeated by foreign forces and will perish together with local goods. We see that factories in cities support thousands and tens of thousands of workers, but we don't know how many thousands and tens of thousands of people are unemployed and even lose their food in the interior. To give a simple example. "Men plow and women weave" is the custom of China's family economy and rural economy that has been passed down for thousands of years. In the past, almost every family in the countryside had a Gandhi-style spinning machine. The weaving technology was better, and the places where cloth was produced were famous, and every family had a loom. Since the development of machine textile factories, they first eliminated hand-spinning machines in the countryside, and then eliminated weaving machines in cloth-producing areas. There is only men plowing, and no more women weaving. Rural women have no work to do. The countryside lacks a major sideline industry. I am not surprised; I am not surprised that machine textiles eliminate Gandhi-style spinning machines. Because even if machine textiles are not run domestically, foreign yarn and cloth will come in torrents and will still eliminate local spinning and weaving. What I am most surprised by is that machine textiles have eliminated local spinning and weaving for many years, and no one has ever thought of another job for rural women to replace spinning and weaving. I see the struggle between domestic goods and local goods (see the Chinese Youth Weekly last year) and I really feel at a loss. How can new industries and old unemployment be taken care of at the same time? If you say that old unemployment can be ignored! Then the unemployed will be unemployed forever, because new industries cannot accommodate so many people. Moreover, such a fragile and pitiful new industry, with capital, machinery, technology, management, and operation that are not as good as others, cannot be protected by the government, and has no united industry association below. Competing with advanced industrialized countries is always uncertain, so how can they take care of old unemployment? The unemployed, in addition to relying on family assistance, have only two ways out: starving to death or committing suicide! To find a third way out, it is inevitable to cause social unrest. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, only the dismissal of postmen caused the chaos of the rebel Li Zicheng. What about adding ten or a hundred times the number of postmen? Those who read foreign books to death and are enthusiastic about industrialization always say that the rise of new industries is inevitable to avoid old unemployment; in this period of new and old transition, it can be ignored, I really have nothing to say to such people, I can only ask them to fast for a few days, to taste the taste of hunger, so that they know how difficult it is to be hungry, and understand whether people who are unemployed and lose their food will wholeheartedly want to cause trouble. "Fools are afraid of the sky falling, and the poor hope to rebel." Who dares to say that there will definitely be no chaos of rebel Li Zicheng in this world? When the new and the old are mixed, this side must be taken care of, and that side must also be taken care of. Agricultural policies! Industrialization! Not only is copying the articles of other countries irrelevant; but even our country's inherent methods of governance cannot be fully applied! Because of such a binding, the semi-colonial status, and the complex phenomenon of the new and old coexisting, is something that no other country has, and has not been seen in our country since ancient times.</p>
<p>V. Several Impossible Paths</p>
<p>I said above that the good and bad of various theories and systems of various countries depend on whether they suit the object of our country. In other words, there is no need to ask whether it is good or bad, just see if it is possible. If it is impossible, no matter how much effort we put in, we will still end up with nothing. Procrastinating again and again, the so-called restoration and the so-called revolution have been going on for decades, and we still cannot find a way out economically. "Time, time, does not wait for people!" We cannot afford to take impossible paths again. Futile efforts should be a lesson to us.</p>
<p>First, the impossibility of capitalism: I said above that the family system is incompatible with capitalism, which is still latent. The development of capitalism has two elements: one is considerable national strength, which can maintain internal peace and resist external aggression (both in terms of military and economy); the other is colonies and uncivilized areas for supply and extraction, which can obtain cheap raw materials and expand the sales channels for finished products. What is our national strength? Where are our colonies and areas for us to extract? Wanting to cross without a boat, wanting to fish without a line, I don't know how to embark on the path of capitalism? Wanting to be a certain magnate will only end up like the Swedish match magnate.</p>
<p>Second, the impossibility of state capitalism: Concentrating capital in the state, with all industries run by the state, and production and consumption also controlled by the state; to achieve this, the most important thing is absolute centralization of power, and the second is extremely good administrative efficiency. These two are what we lack. Even if we have these two conditions, the concessions are horizontal and vertical, and everything has a supreme force there to manipulate. Before capital can be concentrated in the state, it has already fled, so how can we start?</p>
<p>Third, the impossibility of corporatism: Italy's corporatist organization is indeed! In the middle of capitalist state capitalism, another kind of controlled situation is created. However, this also requires considerable national strength and appropriate talents. Our national strength is out of the question; the leading talents cannot be found either. In the past, the result of boycotting certain goods and campaigning for certain things was that a few people filled their pockets. The so-called certain associations are all disguised versions of local tyrants and evil gentry who are manipulating them. Everyone is frowning and suffering the pain of the bamboo pole, with no effect of control at all. Fortunately, China does not have an Italian fascist emperor who is so strong and powerful, otherwise, the people would be even more unbearable to bear this "bamboo pole tribute."</p>
<p>I said above: "The family system inherently contains the meaning of wealth equalization, so socialism is easier to approach than capitalism. I want to use cooperative methods to combine and dissolve material civilization into the family system." Now the government is not promoting cooperation! Unfortunately, they have not recognized the object of China's economy, they are "baffled", and the financial system has not been improved, they cannot get working capital, and the administrative efficiency is too poor, so it has not been very effective.

<h3>Securities - The Bond Market Environment is Quite Adverse</h3>
<p>The securities market last week (September 30 to October 5) was completely surrounded by the environment. Internal and external troubles came one after another. The Italy-Abyssinia War had begun, and rumors were rampant domestically, making it impossible to investigate. Short selling was naturally crowded, and most long positions were disheartened. Only investment in spot goods was not shaken, so although market prices fluctuated greatly, they did not collapse. Last week's experience was quite repetitive. Generally, No. 48 was sold off for several days and bought back on Friday and Saturday. No. 11 and No. 16 were sold off throughout the week, and the rest mostly sold more and bought less, showing a tendency to adapt to the circumstances. No. 4 and No. 43 also gradually leaned towards selling. Although the market downturn was severe, the rebound was also rapid. Retail investors were sometimes long and sometimes short, in a state of disarray. Monday's rumors triggered selling by the northern gangs, causing prices to fall by several jiao to about one yuan. On Tuesday, the environment was still stable, but suddenly someone staged a ridiculous drama of raising 96, rising by one yuan sharply, which was a sign of environmental change. The rest was stable. On Wednesday, Italy and Abyssinia had already started the war, but the long side was still stable. The first board fell more sharply, and the rest was slightly stable, similar to Tuesday. On Thursday, the situation was serious, and rumors arose at home and abroad, intensifying the downward trend. There were as many as seven types of stocks that broke the lowest price of November 11th of the previous month. On Friday, the Italy-Abyssinia war had begun, and Britain showed no signs of joining the vortex. Moreover, due to excessive declines in recent days, No. 48 covered short positions very aggressively, and market prices rebounded sharply, with a strong rebound. Gold short positions surged by 1.25 yuan, while selling pressure on No. 11 and No. 16 remained strong. On Saturday, the situation was slightly stable, and there was no new progress in the environment. Market prices were exhausted, and future changes were difficult to predict. International winds and clouds were still in a state of power struggle, hoping to reverse the situation, but it was feared that it would not be easy to change the people's minds. Last week's market price results showed a drop of 2-3 jiao to one yuan, with only 96 rising by about half a yuan. The total turnover was 95,381,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York Stocks Related to Military Affairs All Rose</p>
<p>Sinfeng Yanghang reported that yesterday (5th), the New York stock market was firm and trading was slightly active. Steel stocks discovered a new high in 1935, and the comparison was the strongest. The demand for auto stocks was also strong. Before the close, floating long positions emerged, and prices rebounded. However, auto parts, aircraft, and railway stocks all rose in the end. Small exchange stocks rose slightly in a mixed manner. Bond market ups and downs were mixed. Half-day turnover was 700,000 shares.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton - The Trend of Hedging Sales of American Cotton Still Exists</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the market was still active. The aftermath of hedging sales from the previous day still existed. The weekend's long position closures rose again. At the same time, there was no severe frost in the cotton area, and buyers were waiting and watching. Prices for each month fell by 3 to 8 points. The industry's needs were very good. Outside speculation gradually increased. Brokers also engaged in buying. Unfortunately, hedging sales continued. Spot sales were still smooth, and the ground was firm. Textiles were more active, and the closing was stable. Spot goods were unchanged, futures fell by 2 to 8 points. British cotton spot goods were unchanged, futures rose by one point. Indian cotton was weak due to Japanese selling and long position closures. Ping Guo Er fell by 3.75 rupees, and Aum La and Bai Luo Xi fell by 4 rupees. The original telegram recorded the following (5th telegram):</p>

<h3>Oil Market - The Crisis of White Tung Oil is Imminent</h3>
<p>Since the price of white tung oil in Hanshi rose to 86 yuan per dan, most of the full-weight goods have been collected by various foreign firms, resulting in no market for several days. Currently, the goods handled by foreign firms are all underweight goods, and the prices vary. However, the combined full-weight price may be more than 86 yuan. However, because they need the goods, various foreign firms, although they dislike the high prices, still have to buy them. However, they are unwilling to do so, so various countries in Europe and the United States are widely planting tung trees domestically, hoping to increase production as soon as possible. And they are still not satisfied, reducing the tung oil content in the manufacture of paints in various paint factories. In the past, tung oil was mixed with other miscellaneous oils in equal proportions, but now only 30% tung oil is used. If so, the use of tung oil will be reduced a lot. Production increases while usage decreases, so that the tung oil needed in the future will not depend on foreign countries. It is heard that various countries have this plan. This kind of plan is all caused by the excessively high selling price in our country. Originally, if the price of tung oil was above 30 yuan per dan, it would be cost-effective for various countries in Europe and the United States to plant their own trees. Therefore, the selling price of tung oil in our country should not be too high. Today's price increase is actually inviting a crisis. Those who do not understand foreign trade think that they are selling at a good price and celebrate each other. In fact, high prices are feared. Now the market has reached its peak. Once there is a backlash, the day of a sharp decline is just around the corner.</p>
<h3>Hongjiang Tung Oil Falls, Orders See Rise</h3>
<p>Hongjiang tung oil has no export route and is only supplied to the domestic market, so the market's rise and fall is only one or two yuan at most, and it never rises as dramatically as white tung oil. However, it is fundamentally transformed by white tung oil. Now that raw materials have risen so much, even though it is the time of the autumn sales decline, it is still somewhat related to white tung oil, so people no longer underestimate it. This year's new goods will definitely have high costs, and the market will also see a big rise in prices. For example, Zheng Hong Jichang and He have sold orders for 34 yuan per barrel, and Fu Hong Yang Hengyuan Qing Yuanfeng have sold orders for 28 yuan. It seems that there is a possibility of further increases. However, because it is limited to domestic sales, even if it rises, it will be gradual.</p>
<h3>Metals - American Tinplate Rises Endlessly</h3>
<p>Whether it is 90-pound or 100-pound American tinplate, regardless of the pattern, the market rose sharply yesterday. The reason is that the bottom goods are extremely scarce and the fixed price is high, so people's minds are getting better. The estimated price is 2-3 yuan better than before. For example, 90-pound single-connection is opened at 17.5 yuan per box, and double-connection is opened at 34 yuan. 100-pound single-connection is opened at 18.5 yuan, and double-connection is opened at 37 yuan. It is found that apart from a small batch opened yesterday, there is still no large-scale business. According to the observation of the market's people, the market outlook is expected to rise again.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - The Inventory of Foreign Sugar in This Market Has Increased Slightly (as of October 5)</h3>

<p>Total 132,270 pieces. In addition, there are 8,060 pieces of miscellaneous sugar stored in the West Taigu warehouse.</p>
<h3>Food - Rice Markets in the North and South Are Each Up by One Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 30 batches of goods arrived from various gangs (a total of more than 6,000 shi). The sales market in this street was initially active, but later became dull. People's minds were leaning towards rising prices. As a result, the market prices of various goods still had an upward color. The prices of thick broken rice rose by about 1 jiao. Thin broken rice continued to have more than 600 packages handled by Yantai and Qingdao gangs, increasing by 2 jiao. Although the price of medium-grade new thin rice from Baige Kiln was unchanged, there were only one or two hundred packages. Except for Suzhou and Tongxiang goods, which were rare and fragrant, the thick new japonica rice did not have much glory or disgrace. Du Yang and other various new top-quality rice relied on the wide range of destinations, and rose by 1 jiao. The old and new Yinbian rice also showed an upward trend yesterday.

<h3>Cold Satire and Hot Scolding</h3>
<p>- Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>There are now many people who do not like to read texts that scold people, saying that kind of thing cannot be considered literature. This is, of course, a prejudice. But in my opinion, the form of literature is not just one. Whether it is abuse, cold satire, hot ridicule, or humor, as long as it is a mature thing, it is definitely good. But it depends on whether your thinking is mature and whether the object of mockery is correct. Humor is also great if what is written can be like Cervantes' Don Quixote. Abuse depends on what you are scolding, and satire also depends on what you are satirizing. If, like Shaw, you satirize British customs and the ugliness of the aristocracy, laughing them to the point of being completely devastated, that is valuable. Like Turgenev, mocking the nobles who abused serfs with suggestive strokes is also valuable. He satirized those nobles who forced female slaves to sing and dance and drink all night, saying:</p>
<p>"If they showed some fatigue, he would hold his head with both hands and sigh, 'Ah! Poor, poor me! People are ignoring me...' Then the coachman would stimulate those women with a whip."</p>
<p>How profound is this mocking stroke. When we read "stimulate those women with a whip," we really don't feel like laughing, but we really can't laugh. There is a great sadness, a great sorrow of oppressed life, contained here. At the same time, on the other hand, it clearly exposes the vicious, hideous ugly face, and we really can't help but be angry. Our hearts are already filled with things that can burn, and this passage of his is like kindling. As soon as we read this article, the fire in our hearts will immediately burn. Isn't this kind of satirical thing good?</p>
<p>If it is said that the product of literature must have emotions, then the texts of cold satire and hot scolding are not without emotions. As in the example I mentioned above, Turgenev would not have been able to write such an article if he had not been extremely angry. From this passage, we can see that his emotions are extremely suppressed, but the more suppressed, the deeper the emotions, so it is written in this way. On the outside surface, it looks indifferent, but in fact, it contains deep emotions. Shaw's cold satire also seems to have gone through a period of anger. On the surface, it is laughable, but in fact, it is extremely thought-provoking, not like that simply a problem that is simply laughable. His articles have this kind of expression everywhere, and I will not give any more examples.</p>
<p>In terms of the style of writing, cold satire and hot scolding, it seems that cold satire is a little higher than hot scolding, but in fact, the two are the same. That is to say, in terms of human character, some people are calm and some people are enthusiastic. Calm people are not necessarily better than enthusiastic people. Kucagawa Bai Village has a piece about cold satire and hot scolding, and his opinion is very good. Let me copy it below:</p>
<p>"When it comes to mockery, at first you have to think of coldness, you have to think of the paleness of color. The so-called ridicule, the so-called satire, I think the colder it is, the more it will increase the taste of ridicule and pleasure. When it comes to scolding, at first you have to think of heat, and at the same time you have to associate it with angry hair, the hot blood and hot-tempered people with faces splashed with red. When the heat exceeds the boiling point, there you can see the pleasure of cursing, and the increase in the taste of enthusiasm. The former has a rational calmness, with plenty of leeway. And in its half, there is an unintentional accompaniment to a taste of disgust. The latter is from a heated emotional nature, so although it seems to have an unchanging naivety and straightforwardness, at the same time, I am afraid that it is inevitable that there will be a crazy and careless attitude. The former can be said to be like water like ice, and like a sharp blade, while the latter is like fire like flame, and like a sledgehammer. In the former, it can be seen as having a classical taste, and in the latter, there is a romantic interest."</p>
<p>This passage of his describing cold satire and hot scolding is exactly what I wanted to say but didn't say. In short, cold satire and hot scolding are equally important. This is the difference in the style of writing, not the height of character. Literature has tolerance, and the method of expression can be casual. Whether it is essays, dramas, or poems; humor, cold satire, hot scolding... it doesn't matter. The most important thing is only the word "consciousness". Is what you are mocking the public's hated? Is your target correct? If this purpose is correct, then this article is great and has permanent value.</p>
<p>We don't have to reject essays, and we don't have to specialize in worshiping novels. This is only a matter of form. There is also "consciousness" that is more important than form. Have we forgotten?</p>
<h3>Guihua City</h3>
<p>- Yuan Chenying</p>
<p>- One of the Impressions of Suiyuan -</p>
<p>The train crawled out of the railway lying across the Great Qingshan Mountain outside the Great Wall like a snake. It took a long breath. At the foot of the gloomy green pines of the Great Qingshan Mountain, the first thing that was revealed was the tall stone city wall of the new city two and a half miles south of the railway. After passing the city wall, you arrived at Suiyuan Station.</p>
<p>Jumping off the train, when you walk out of the station, if you are an outsider, the people selling snacks and drinks at the station will think: "Look! Today the masters and misses from Beijing are here for inspection again."</p>
<p>Walking down from the station. Sitting in a rickshaw pulled by a skinny hand. Slowly walking towards the city, passing over the stone-paved road. On both sides are tall poplar trees, and the leaves cast wide shadows. The road is quiet, and you will think: "What a quiet place!"</p>
<p>When the rickshaw reaches the place where the Catholic forces invaded this remote part of the Great Wall—the place where foreign adults do good deeds—the public hospital, the west city gate tower of the new city stands tall in the east, half-hidden and half-visible like a pagoda in a picture of a fairy scene. Two "人"-shaped roads to the southeast are laid out in front of you, and the rickshaw driver will turn his head and ask you: "Let's go to the old city?" When you nod, he will pull you weakly again, and stagger towards the south.</p>
<p>When you reach the south entrance of the road, it is exactly a four-mile-long east-west road from the old city to the new city, and the road to the station恰凑成a "丁"character. As soon as you turn the corner, you will see the big chimney of the Suiyuan Woolen Mill standing there, and the rumbling sound of the machine spreads in the air. Houses are being built on both sides of the road, and the road roller is like a clumsy cow, shaking its big belly, rolling back and forth on the road, and the pedestrians are walking past in twos and threes, quietly, like some mice, and the people riding bicycles are just like pulling a cow, slowly driving past.</p>
<p>When you are about to enter the old city, there is a very tall building, which was originally a memorial hall, but now it is going to be turned into a gathering place.</p>
<p>Walking into the city, the uneven road will make you feel breathless in the car. Under the poplar trees are rows of earthen houses. After passing this, you will enter Guihua City. The street is being rebuilt. The laborers who are打石子are constantly putting stones on the road. The stones are flying up and flying towards your body, which will suddenly scare you.</p>
<p>Although the Public Security Bureau reported that the number of stores paying business tax has decreased from 7,000 to 3,000, the stores on the North Gate Street are being knocked down and rebuilt one by one, widened and rebuilt! The road is narrow! How can cars pass through? So, the road is wider, so...</p>
<p>On the two-mile-long South Street, all kinds of people are crowded at the street head. Lamas wearing clumsy cassocks, Hui people wearing university doctorate hats, and most of them are Han people. People are crowded like ants at the crossroads. This place should also be widened! However—however...</p>
<p>The store's gramophone is playing various musics,嘩拉嘩拉的, and the sound of cars and rickshaws奏出了this desert city's symphony. When night covers the land outside the Great Wall, there are many people standing under the flashing electric lights listening to the radio, but the owner of the store is sighing! "Just listen! Things can't be sold! Ah! Why are the villagers (Note 1) so poor?…" Slowly, he also has to immerse himself in the 嘩拉嘩拉的 evening radio music with those listeners.</p>
<p>(Note 1) "Villager" is the word for farmer outside the Great Wall.</p>
<h3>The Story of a Horse (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Lin Shi</p>
<p>This horse, because it was covered in a deep chestnut coat, was given a beautiful name by its master. It has had this beautiful name for several years, and as a result, it has lived in its master's house for many years as well.</p>
<p>It is not wrong to say that it is truly quite foolish. When it was young, it didn't need to wait for the master's whip to lash its backside; it could run thirty or forty *li* (Chinese miles) in one go without resting. The master would ride it everywhere to collect rent, and also ride it to go hunting, and sometimes even have it pull the carriage for the ladies. He would almost always praise it for being truly able to run. And when it heard these words of praise, it would screech in a high-pitched voice and let out a long cry, expressing the indescribable joy in its heart.</p>
<p>Not only could it run, but it could also eat. In spring and summer, needless to say, the fields were full of lush grass that filled its big belly. In winter, when its master occasionally gave it a few *sheng* (a unit of dry measure) of grain in addition to the chopped dry rice straw, it would also happily cry out.</p>
<p>But the era of youth and strength has long since passed. It had a full set of teeth until two years ago. Now this horse is old.</p>
<p>Today, from morning until now, it is still gnawing on that bucket of dry rice straw. It has not tasted grain for quite some time. The rice straw is so dry and hard, it feels like chewing on many iron nails, causing pain all over its mouth. It thinks that it would be good if only the master would scald the rice straw with boiling water, but even this cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p>While slowly chewing on the straw, it surveys its surroundings. The sun has already climbed very high. Thin white clouds float in the sky. The branches of the trees in the garden have sprouted green buds and new leaves at some point. It seems that winter has quietly passed, and the fragrant breath of spring has once again spread across the human world.</p>
<p>After a long time, it finally fills its belly. The warm sun shines on its body, making it feel pleasantly warm. It shivers all over, and a lot of the shed winter fur scatters on the ground. It seems to be stimulated by the sun and feels very energetic. It hasn't cried out for a long time, so it thinks about it and lets out a loud cry, crying very enthusiastically and for a long time. But the master, hearing its cry from inside the house, walks to the corridor and smiles and scolds it from afar:</p>
<p>"Ha! You old beast, you're finally crying out!"</p>
<p>As the master says these words, the tall gray dog beside him also barks twice along with the master.</p>
<p>"Old beast!" The master has often used this phrase to scold it in recent years. Before, he would happily call it by its name, but now he starts every sentence with "old beast." Thinking about this, it cannot help but feel resentful and unhappy. However, it also knows very well that it is indeed old. But it also thinks: That mongrel dog also barked at me twice along with the master? Does it deserve to? Ha! Lowly beast! Dogs are much more lowly than horses.</p>
<p>Soon, the master brings out the saddle and bridle, saying:</p>
<p>"Old beast, I'm taking you hunting today." Then he straps the saddle on its back, and the bit in the bridle tightly binds its mouth. It has had many experiences with hunting; in the mountains and forests, it would gallop very fast with the master on its back. The master would aim his gun at wild animals like roe deer and rabbits, and the living creatures would fall to the ground, dripping with bright red blood.</p>
<p>Now it is going hunting again. Sure enough, the master is wearing light and agile short clothes and carrying a gun. The leather whip sways in front of its eyes a few times, and then he straddles its back. Suddenly, a hundred or so *jin* (about 110 pounds) of weight is added to its body, and its legs cannot help but weaken a little. The morning sun has made it feel lazy, and it really doesn't want to run, but when it thinks about the stinging pain of the leather whip, it has no choice but to run forward.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Over Firewood and Rice</h3>
<h3>Dusk at Silver Terrace Mountain</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the evening glow, I climbed Silver Terrace Mountain, now renamed Boxian Park. The late summer breeze was already carrying a slight coolness as it brushed against our bodies. The night slowly descended. The rows of willows planted recently by Boxian abruptly darkened.</p>
<p>Looking up at the sky, the blue turned gray. One bird, then another, then another, I counted to myself. Walking to the top of the mountain, the houses were arranged like pigeons' or bees' nests below. In the distance, one light, two lights, vague and lonely little nocturnes!</p>
<p>The wind blew harder and harder. Immediately, my heart also floated up. At first, there were waves of fantastical floating thoughts, and then even the floating thoughts disappeared. My heart was as serene as the wind in March. The Buddhist concept of no ego and no attachment to anything, perhaps that's what it's like?</p>
<p>The wind blew my clothes up, rustling. Even my heart and lungs felt thoroughly clear. I shifted my gaze to the very far, very far distance: I vaguely saw the ancient Wucheng (Wuhu) and the moon over Guazhou (near Nanjing). Ultimately, was I forgetting my emotions about things, or were things forgetting their emotions about me? I was lost.</p>
<p>At the height of my bewilderment, a kind of primal, confused, excited, and happy emotion that primitive humans often had arose. I jumped, I wildly waved my hands. The people who came with me all laughed.</p>
<p>We turned right from Boxian Temple. There was a slanting dirt slope going down, about several *zhang* (approximately 10 feet). At the end of the road, it was impossible to go up any further. There were only overgrown thorns and mounds of earth and rocks. Step by step we walked downwards, and a smear of rouge-colored sunset was at the same level as us. Beautiful sunset! How should I praise it?</p>
<p>Below the mountain, there was a stretch of paddy fields submerged in water. At first glance, it seemed impossible to recognize those as the cloud-like fields that produced rice and wheat. Now, part of them was in the water, and part was on land. Half of the nearby houses were also submerged in water. When I saw those, I immediately thought of a series of images of refugees from the flood.</p>
<p>The flying birds returned to the forest, the cicadas had stopped singing, and the twilight gradually deepened.</p>
<p>Approaching the corridor of Boxian Temple, I saw the magnificent architecture steeped in the desolate atmosphere of this dusk. A feeling of nostalgia mixed with the sigh that "The great river flows eastward, sweeping away countless historical figures" filled me. In addition to mourning Mr. Boxian, I also mourned this enigmatic life.</p>
<p>There were more electric lights than when we came. Each one was embedded on the curtain of the black universe. I stepped on Silver Terrace's famous "Evening Glow" and walked to the park's teahouse.</p>
<h3>The Honorary Old Woman (Part 3)</h3>
<p>— Written by Ema Shū, Translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>On the way home, I told her about the things that I had suddenly thought of during the war. The mobilization notices, the send-offs for the soldiers going to war, the news and special editions announcing the war and victories, the lives of the fallen acquaintances and their bereaved families... everywhere, there were only the two words "honorary." Everywhere was honorary. Honorary soldiers, honorary victories, honorary deaths...</p>
<p>Then, I thought of that long-forgotten honorary old woman. Yes, there once was a person called the honorary old woman. Even so, in reality, for a long time, I seemed to have completely forgotten her, and had not thought of her at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, I could not help but tell my wife the story of this strange old woman.</p>
<p>The so-called honorary old woman was, no, was a nickname. And it was a nickname that people had unconsciously given her during the war. Her real name was Cooking Old Woman, and she was the cook in my house.</p>
<p>When did the Cooking Old Woman first come to my house? Regarding this, I have no exact memory. I'm afraid she came a long time ago, perhaps when I was still a child. Her hair was always disheveled and messy, she had deeply sunken and strangely gleaming eyes, a toothless mouth that only revealed red gums when she smiled, a sallow complexion, and she was dressed sloppily without any regard. No matter how people looked at her, they would feel that she was not an ordinary old woman. In fact, we often thought of her as crazy. Of course, she didn't say or do anything particularly strange, but one could always see things that felt a little peculiar. Therefore, she never seemed to be suitable to be the cook, who should be clean. However, she was indeed a very hardworking woman, not lazy at all. She single-handedly took care of almost all the cooking for the hundred female workers in the silk mill and many other servants. Therefore, my mother liked her very much. Everyone else also had good feelings toward her.</p>
<p>She had a small, impoverished home on the edge of the market. There were also a husband and an only son named Yongzao. When the old woman talked about Yongzao, those strangely gleaming eyes would take on an indescribable tenderness, and a seemingly proud glow would appear on her sallow face. Especially when he was deemed fit for Category A service during the conscription examination, the old woman was even more proud. Her son was selected to be a soldier for the country! She seemed to feel that this was simply the supreme glory for a poor family. Moreover, before this joy and pride, she seemed to have completely forgotten that when the oarsman was taken into the army, the family's life would immediately become difficult.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research on Chinese Materia Medica (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Notes by Nie Zhichen and Wang Mingding, Lecture by Dr. Zeng Guangfang</p>
<p>Three thousand years before the common era, Fangji Liu Xiang set out to study all the *bencao* (materia medica) in the world. He collected all the famous *bencao* books of the time and made considerable efforts to organize them, but unfortunately, he died before he could complete this work! Later, his son Liu Xin continued his efforts and finally succeeded.</p>
<p>(2) Alchemy and Elixir Making: These belong to the Taoist school. They also have an inseparable relationship with the origins of *bencao*.</p>
<p>(3) As mentioned above, there are many names of herbs in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, which are closely related to the origins of *bencao*. However, there are many questions about when this book was published or who wrote it, and it is impossible to verify the facts. The herbs recorded in it are divided into four methods of use. From this, we can know the prototype of the methods of use at that time. The classification and usage of herbs in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Effective when taken internally: 68 kinds in total. Divided into: 21 kinds of plants, 47 kinds of animals.</p>
<p>(2) Effective when worn or taken internally: 29 kinds in total. Divided into: 17 kinds of plants, 10 kinds of animals, 2 kinds of minerals.</p>
<p>(3) Those that bring good or bad omens when seen: 52 kinds in total. Only animals are included; no minerals or plants.</p>
<p>(4) Those with medicinal and other effects: 55 kinds in total. Divided into: 21 kinds of plants, 30 kinds of animals, 4 kinds of minerals.</p>
<p>Here, we examine the four types of effective products and their uses as discussed in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*: There is no doubt that the first method of use makes the herbs effective; regarding the effects of the second method of use, it is probably because there was no perfume at that time, and when encountering unclean smells, it was necessary to wear these fragrant herbs to dispel the foul odors; the third type, which indicates good or bad omens when seen, is sufficient to reflect the superstitious color of ghosts, gods, medicine, and healing at that time; the fourth type cannot be commented on.</p>
<p>*Bencao* in the Tang and Song Dynasties</p>
<p>The culture of the Tang and Song dynasties occupies a glorious page in Chinese history, and the historical process of *bencao* also took that period as its main era.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the Tang Dynasty's Xianqing era, Su Jing and Li Ji felt that the *Shennong Bencao Jing* compiled by Tao Hongjing had lost its relevance and needed to be reorganized, so they jointly published the *Tang Xinxiu Bencao* (Newly Revised *Bencao* of the Tang). It had a total of 53 volumes, recording a total of 814 kinds of *bencao*. Su Jing and Li Ji were both high-ranking officials at the time. If we think about it, officials in positions of authority in the autocratic era were able to pay attention to the medical problems of the people and make considerable efforts to address them. It can be said that this was a major turning point in the history of *bencao*, from a private undertaking to a government-run undertaking, setting an unprecedented new record, which is also the precursor of modern health administration. In the 27th year of the Tang Dynasty's Kaiyuan era, Chen Cangqi wrote the *Bencao Shiyi* (Supplement to the *Bencao*) to supplement its shortcomings.</p>
<p>In the early Song Dynasty: Liu Han and Ma Zhong wrote the *Kaibao Xin Xiangding Bencao* (Newly Revised and Detailed *Bencao* of the Kaibao Era), which had 20 volumes. The content and materials were much richer than the *bencao* books of the Tang and Song dynasties. The *Kaibao Chongding Bencao* (Revised and Redetermined *Bencao* of the Kaibao Era) and the *Jiayou Zhu Bencao* (Annotated *Bencao* of the Jiayou Era), written by Liu Han, Ma Zhong, Li Fang, Wang You, Hu Mengtang, Yu Xi, and Su Song, are three books that are also most closely related to *bencao*. In the 7th year of the Song Dynasty's Yuanyou era, Chen Zicheng, a famous doctor from Sichuan, felt dissatisfied with the various *bencao* books of the past and emphasized the *Guangbu Zhu Bencao* (Extensively Supplemented and Annotated *Bencao*), which had 23 volumes. It contained records of his own experiences using *bencao*. In the 2nd year of the Song Dynasty's Daguan era, there was a Tang Shenwei who was not interested in becoming an official but was extremely interested in studying *bencao*. He wrote the *Daguan Bencao*, which was published by the imperial court at that time. He also published the *Zhenghe Bencao* with Cao Xiaozhong in the 6th year of the Zhenghe era. Although the names of these two books are different, their contents are the same. In the same year, Kou Zongshi deleted the ineffective herbs from the *bencao* and only recorded the practical herbs, writing the *Bencao Yanyi* (Elaboration on the *Bencao*).</p>
<p>*Bencao* in the Ming and Qing Dynasties</p>
<p>In the early years of the Ming Dynasty's Hongwu era, it was a time of famine, and people were starving everywhere. Zhou Xianwang Chengqi collected various *bencao* with hunger-quenching functions and wrote the *Jiuhuang Bencao* (Herbal for Famine Relief), which was published. The content was based on the *bencao* books of the Tang and Song dynasties. It is admirable that the noble prince was able to be so considerate of the people's hardships. More than a hundred years later, Li Shizhen used the *bencao* books of the Tang and Song dynasties and the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* as a starting point, and the *Daguan Bencao* as a blueprint, to publish the *Bencao Gangmu* (Compendium of Materia Medica). It had a total of 52 volumes, recording a total of 1,871 kinds of herbs.</p>
<p>Although various reference books for the study of *bencao* were published in the Qing Dynasty, they were not very valuable. What can leave a mark in history is the *Bencao Tupu* (Illustrated *Bencao*) written by Wu Qijun. Wu collected *bencao* from various places and made illustrations of the various forms in which they grew according to the different geology and climates. It is truly admirable!</p>

<h3>Common Sense on Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(66) Parotitis</p>
<p>Parotitis is also known as mumps. In colloquial terms, it is called "fried cheeks swelling." This disease often becomes an epidemic for a time. Or it spreads to a part of the region and becomes an endemic pain. It is most prevalent in spring and autumn. It is rare in winter and summer. It has the ability to transmit directly through contact. Therefore, it is often the case that the whole family can develop the disease one after another. Children and adolescents are most likely to be infected. Infants and the elderly seem to have immunity. Therefore, it is not common. As for the relationship between sexes, it is more common in males than females. Its pathogenic bacteria are not yet clear. Its incubation period is also not fixed. The average is about two weeks. The onset of the disease often comes with the general symptoms of mild fever. That is, a moderate fever, fatigue, dizziness, headache, and mild stomatitis. After one or two days. Parotid glands on one side. Thus, swelling occurs. Gradually rising. The earlobe is also lifted. The patient feels pain and tension in the chewing muscle area. So when opening the mouth, talking, or chewing. Most complain of difficulty and pain. If you try to press the glands with your fingers. Then feel soft. Sometimes it is edematous. The surface of the skin. Appears pale white. Usually after another one or two days. The parotid gland on the other side. Also has inflammatory swelling. At this time, both cheeks are swollen. The face is strange. Therefore, it is colloquially known as "fried cheeks swelling." If this disease has no complications. Then it can be completely cured in seven to ten days. The most common complication. When椎畢丸炎 (transliteration that I cannot find an adequate translation for). At this time, the testicles are quite swollen and painful. In women, mastitis, oophoritis, or vaginitis may occur.</p>
<p>This disease rarely has the risk of suppuration. If there is, it is due to secondary infection. At this time, the swollen skin. It becomes red and shiny. When you press it with your hand. Then there is a burning sensation. Its hardness. It is like soft mud. Submandibular and sublingual glands. Most also have swelling.</p>
<p>In addition, so-called secondary parotitis. Often occurs in several severe illnesses. Especially when suffering from typhoid fever. This is because the mouth is unclean. The virus invades from the parotid gland. Or it is induced by blood flow and viruses. The degree of swelling of this type of parotitis. It is very severe. And mostly forms abscesses.</p>
<p>The treatment for this disease. Is very simple. During the period of fever. Be sure to rest in bed. Apply cold compresses or ice compresses to the parotid area. Apply petroleum jelly or olive oil. In order to reduce the tension of the skin layer.) In our country, it is common to apply well-bottom mud to the local area, saying that it is effective. In fact, it is nothing more than taking its coolness to relieve skin tension.) The mouth should always be kept clean. When the inflammation is severe. Then apply ichthammol ointment. Or use a Solux lamp to irradiate. If orchitis occurs. Then use a提畢帶 (transliteration that I cannot find an adequate translation for) to raise the testicles high. Apply cold compresses or ice compresses to the scrotal area. As for secondary parotitis when an abscess has already formed. Then cut open and drain the pus.</p>

<h3>Q&amp;A on Common Knowledge About Teeth (4)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 18) When do baby teeth fall out?</p>
<p>(Answer) Baby teeth must wait until the child is six years old, when the first permanent molar comes out, before they gradually begin to fall out. This first permanent molar can be regarded as the vanguard of the permanent teeth. When it comes out, the rest of the permanent teeth will also appear in turn to replace the baby teeth. This period of replacement is commonly called the teething period.</p>
<p>(Question 19) How long does the teething period last? What is the order of replacement during this period?</p>
<p>(Answer) After the first permanent molar comes out at the age of six, the above-mentioned five types of baby teeth will be replaced approximately one type per year. The central incisors are replaced around the age of seven. The lateral incisors are replaced around the age of eight. The deciduous premolars are replaced around the age of nine. The deciduous molars are replaced around the age of ten. The canines are replaced at the age of eleven or twelve (but the lower canines come earlier by one or two years). However, this is very approximate: the teething period varies greatly from person to person and from tooth to tooth; some differ by as much as two or three years (the above is calculated according to actual age).</p>
<p>(Question 20) What changes occur when baby teeth are about to be replaced?</p>
<p>(Answer) When a certain baby tooth is about to be replaced, because the permanent tooth grows and pushes from underneath, its root will gradually absorb and shorten, almost to nothing. Therefore, it becomes very loose. This is a natural indication that it should fall out. It is very easy to remove it at this time; there is also less pain.</p>
<p>(Question 21) What happens if baby teeth are not removed when they are loose?</p>
<p>(Answer) If we neglect this natural indication when baby teeth become loose, or if we indulge our children's fear of pain and do not remove them, they will still regain their firmness after a few months. The permanent teeth underneath will be blocked and will have to slant to the side. As a result, the teeth will grow unevenly for life. Not only is it unsightly, but it is also difficult to brush all of them when brushing, and it is easy to hide dirt and bacteria, which is indeed a major cause of tooth decay.</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (69)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>What kind of climate is most suitable for patients with this disease? The most important condition is, of course, whether the air is clean or not! In addition, factors such as temperature, air pressure, humidity, sunlight, and wind are also related. Places with a lot of dust and smoke are the least suitable. The differences in temperature, air pressure, humidity, sunlight, and wind are absolutely different between mountains and seashores, and between summer and winter. Even the respective disease conditions of patients are different, so the suitability also varies greatly. But generally speaking, seashores are suitable in winter, mountains are suitable in summer, and dry and less humid plains are suitable from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Regarding mountain convalescence, ordinary people are often too superstitious, as if the illness can be cured just by setting foot there. This is of course due to excessive one-sided propaganda. In fact, not every pulmonary tuberculosis patient is suitable for mountain convalescence, and sometimes it is more harmful than beneficial. Severe laryngeal tuberculosis, pulmonary emphysema, intestinal tuberculosis, and concurrent kidney, heart, diabetes, and other diseases are all contraindications. In addition, if the body temperature increases above 38.5 degrees Celsius, the pulse is frequent, more than 100 per minute, the lesion infiltration area is too large, breathing is difficult, the heart is weak, and the patient is excessively anemic and prone to melancholy, mountain convalescence is also very unsuitable. These phenomena are sometimes extremely complex, so the suitability for mountain convalescence must be determined after a thorough examination by a doctor.</p>
<h3>Medical Treatment for Pain Relief (35)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Opium</p>
<p>Opium comes from the poppy. Dry opium contains about 10% morphine. Codeine is also a component of opium. Heroin is a product of morphine. Papaverine and noscapine are also lesser narcotics found in opium. The effects of morphine have been described in detail above. Since morphine is the main component of opium, the effects of opium are the same as morphine. Opium has a faster constipating effect than morphine, so the greatest use of opium in medicine is to stop diarrhea. Note that the use of antidiarrheals should be appropriate, otherwise it will not help with diarrhea. Codeine has the mildest narcotic effect and is used to relieve coughs and pain.</p>
<p>The chemical formula of heroin is: C17 H17(C2H3 O2)2NO HCI H2O. It is the strongest of narcotics. Its ferocity is greater than floods and wild beasts. It is easy to become addicted to and difficult to quit. It is a sharp weapon for destroying a country and exterminating a race. People must never try it.</p>
<p>Narcotic Addiction</p>
<p>People who are forced by hunger and cold are prone to take risks. People who are forced by pain are prone to fall into the trap of narcotics. Many people are innocent. When they are in pain, they are persuaded by ignorant people to try opium, morphine, heroin, etc. They only think of temporary anesthesia and pain relief as a source of satisfaction and do not know the danger of the future. People with weak willpower are especially easily fooled. Regular use of narcotics for ten days can lead to addiction. If used continuously for 20 to 30 days, the addiction will become deeply rooted.</p>
<p>When in pain or sick, do not seek comfort from narcotics. It must be understood that narcotics only anesthetize and do not cure the disease. Pain is sometimes an emergency sign of disease that requires proper medical treatment to avoid danger to life. Narcotics should not be sought. Using narcotics to treat acute illnesses is like a person falling asleep on a raging fire line. Even if one is unaware of the danger, the danger is certainly greater. Therefore, the only good way to deal with pain and illness is to ask a qualified doctor to use proper medical methods to resolve it.</p>
<p>Quitting Smoking and Drugs</p>
<p>No matter how brave a person is, no matter what kind of hero he is, once he is addicted to narcotics, he becomes an absolutely docile slave to narcotics. Why is he said to be an absolutely docile slave? Because slaves can sometimes resist their masters, but slaves to narcotics are not. He serves his narcotic master wholeheartedly and sincerely throughout his life, daring not to slack off in the slightest, and daring not to resist at all. If a person is willing to be a slave, then so be it. If he does not want to be a slave, then he should make a great determination to declare war on narcotics. Self-improvement depends entirely on this spirit.</p>
<p>The greatest power of narcotics is nothing more than causing people to feel (1) discomfort, (2) nervous disorders, (3) depression and annoyance, (4) craving for narcotics, and (5) trembling and a great sense of impending death when they quit.</p>
<p>Quitting smoking and drugs using scientific medical methods can be said to be without danger. The first thing to do to quit drugs is to make a determination. Although there may be some discomfort during the short period of quitting, the final victory can definitely be achieved. Here is an example: a person who had a long-standing addiction and smoked a large amount of opium, had been addicted for nearly 30 years, and was extremely thin. He said that he wanted to quit his opium addiction and that he must use the direct quitting method, without using substitutes. He made up his mind, went through some suffering, and eventually quit his opium addiction. This is clear proof of the success of determination.</p>

<h3>Deepening of the Shanghai Recession</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Under the shadow of the economic downturn, recently four major businesses in the city, including Tianji Pharmacy, Yuan Xinchang Silk Fabric Store, Liyong Company, and Fangquan Bathhouse, have announced liquidation due to declining business and inability to maintain operations. At the same time, it is heard that the real estate industry is also very depressed, with few transactions and a feeling of being ignored. This situation fully demonstrates that the future of Shanghai's industry and commerce hides a serious crisis.</p>
<p>Shanghai's prosperity was originally superficial. Although some people are shouting that Shanghai is about to become London or New York, Shanghai's exhaustion is only increasing day by day. The collapse of small and medium-sized businesses has gradually made the market uneasy. The successive closures of large companies and banks are enough to shake the entire economic situation. The above-mentioned four major businesses? Tianji Pharmacy has been open for 20 years, and Yuan Xinchang Silk Fabric Store has also been established for 15 years, but neither could avoid collapse. The difficulty in maintaining business is evident from this. As for the real estate industry, it has always occupied a superior position. From 1929 to 1931, it was the golden age. Good real estate was fiercely contested, and prices continued to rise. Since then, it has gradually declined, and it has become worse year after year. What was once worth 500,000 yuan is now only worth half. This is another startling illustration of Shanghai's recession.</p>
<p>Shanghai used to be prosperous. Why has it plummeted and fallen into a state of depression today? There are naturally many reasons, but to put it simply, it is the impact of the global economic panic. In addition, China is a semi-colonial country and is also subject to a major oppression, namely the exploitation of the great powers. The hundreds of millions of yuan in import surplus every year were already unbearable for us in normal times. In the autumn of social recession, is it possible to hope that the countryside will not go bankrupt and the cities will not collapse? The great floods in various provinces across the country this summer are even more likely to make Shanghai become increasingly decadent in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the sharp drop in land prices and the sluggish turnover of the local real estate industry, the situation has become even worse since the United States raised silver prices and implemented a policy of buying silver. As a result, not only the real estate and financial industries are in distress, but the general economy is also suffering a great impact. In order to alleviate this adverse phenomenon, real estate developers once decided to issue 50 million yuan of real estate circulation coupons, and also planned to establish a real estate exchange, but it is said that it did not have the desired effect. Recently, organizations such as the Shanghai Banking Association, the Money Shop Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have also jointly submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan to formulate separate regulations to encourage the circulation of real estate. In fact, the recent bleak decline in the real estate industry is closely related to other industries. Before the economic situation can be reversed, industry and commerce cannot develop, and the real estate industry cannot prosper alone. This principle is obvious. The rent reduction movement in the city was launched based on this understanding. Rent reduction can directly revive industry and commerce, and indirectly rescue the real estate industry. However, although the words are good, Shanghai's prosperity is probably not something that will happen in the near future.</p>
<h3>School Opening</h3>
<p>— Bai Xi</p>
<p>On the day of school opening, Le Sitong, the principal of ×× Private Elementary School, changed into a faded gray-blue spun silk gown. People would say, "Mr. Le has put on a new dress!" However, on his face, the paleness and worry seemed even deeper than yesterday and the day before.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock in the morning, not a single elementary school student had arrived. His wife asked him to drink porridge, but he frowned and said with a sad face, "Why haven't any children come yet?"</p>
<p>Like an old ox that constantly plows the fields, he ran from the back door to the front door, and then from the front door to the back door. Elementary school students finally came, but not many. "What to do? If there aren't many students this semester, the rent, the debts... Oh, God! What to do?..."</p>
<p>Like an ant on a hot pot, his whole body was burning up. When he heard an elementary school student say that a certain student was not coming to school, it was as if he had been hit by a bullet, right in his worried and nervous heart.</p>
<p>Finally, it was time for the opening ceremony. The bell rang, and sitting in a relatively large classroom were only a few elementary school students. Facing these elementary school students, this principal felt like a prisoner facing the muzzle of a gun that would kill him. He did not say, "Today is the first day of school,..." The first sentence he said was, "Why are so few children here?"</p>
<p>So he picked up the attendance list from last semester and began to call out the names, making a special mark on those who were not present today.</p>
<p>"Why isn't Wang Xiangsheng here? Does anyone know?" His voice was crying.</p>
<p>Immediately, an elementary school student stood up and said, "I met him a few days ago and asked him if he was coming to school. He said he wasn't, because his whole family was moving back to their hometown, leaving only his father in Shanghai to do business."</p>
<p>"Oh, then, does anyone know why Li Shangen isn't coming to school?"</p>
<p>"Li Fangen?" Another child stood up</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>and said, "His father doesn't have a business, and he can't afford to send him to school!"</p>
<p>"Zhu Zhiming?"</p>
<p>"He's selling evening newspapers!"</p>
<p>"Wang Xianxian?"</p>
<p>"She's not coming! She's going to a literacy night school. It's free!"</p>
<p>After that, Principal Le made sure to ask about all the students who were not present, but he didn't remember what the answers he heard were. He only saw the insidious face of the accountant collecting the rent and the extremely angry faces of the debt collectors.</p>
<p>Unlike the opening of school in the past, after saying some words of encouragement to the students himself, he would ask a few teachers to do the same. Today, after asking about the reasons why the students were not coming to school, he began to say:</p>
<p>"Children! You must try your best to introduce your friends to come. I have prizes."</p>
<p>Then school was dismissed.</p>
<p>On this day, Principal Le didn't eat anything. He sat next to the abacus and used it all day. His eyes seemed to be turning red.</p>
<h3>Autumn Musings</h3>
<p>— Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>I'm sick.</p>
<p>Suffering from neurasthenia.</p>
<p>The doctor at the hospital in the health department said that it would take a long period of rest to recover. But, in reality, I cannot have the kind of pure happiness that noble people are used to: I can only treat the courtyard of my apartment as the garden of a sanatorium after work.</p>
<p>(Autumn, you know).</p>
<p>(The beautiful flowers have withered, and the leaves have fallen; the season has a lilac-like melancholy taste.)</p>
<p>In a semi-sick state, the days sing a flowing melody, like the "flower after flower" passing away. Moreover, a sick person cannot be compared with healthy people. Everything feels lazy, and much time is wasted in boring idleness. As the days go by, there is a bitter and astringent taste that often surges in my heart like a tide.</p>
<p>The high tide in the ocean occasionally opens up the spring flowers in the heart.</p>
<p>I once had such a ridiculous amusement. —— Absent-mindedly, leaning against the window sill of the building for most of the day. In a trance, I gently closed my eyes, and suddenly felt a burst of sourness in my heart. When I opened my eyes, for no reason, two teardrops had already formed. …</p>
<p>So, I understand that slight melancholy is the only motherly comfort for the sick.</p>
<p>Although autumn is very lovable, it is always unhealthy.</p>
<p>Healthy people will never find the melancholy autumn lovely.</p>
<p>Notes from an Autumn Window</p>
<p>Outside the window of my small building is a parasol tree. Whenever the slight autumn chill blends into the twilight of dusk, the parasol tree slumps down again, falling into a state of slumber.</p>
<p>It is too lonely. Lonely with its green shade full of trees, and lonely with its sparse leaves falling.</p>
<p>——Why doesn't it bloom!</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the quiet evenings, I would murmur, with a mournful heart that almost cried out.</p>
<p>Because of this, I often like to lean against the window sill, turning my eyes following the clouds in the pale sky. I like to have a sense of desolation, making me feel as if my body is suddenly sinking into a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>(This habit is definitely not healthy, because I would never think of these things when I am not sick.)</p>
<p>So, I stare without any real power. At the same time, I also think of some past events, the old rose-red dreams, the fire-like scorching days, and the youthful exuberance that young people should have.</p>
<p>The past is chaotic. It's just like autumn coming quietly and quietly aging day by day.</p>
<p>Yes, autumn is deep.</p>
<p>Seasonal illnesses have also worsened.</p>
<p>Looking at the depressed old parasol tree outside the window, I ask questions in my heart that cannot be answered.</p>
<p>——When will I be able to relive the wild dreams of my childhood!</p>
<h3>Burial at Sea</h3>
<p>— Da</p>
<p>Old Wang in the steerage lay stiffly straight on the straw mat. His emaciated face was devoid of color, as terrifyingly yellow as if made of wax. His eyeballs kept rolling upwards, exposing his bony chest, which trembled slightly. His mouth was open, and he was breathing with great difficulty, showing a rapid state.</p>
<p>The steerage was filled with the unpleasant stench of sweaty acid, and the pungent smell of moldy goods. The humid and stuffy air made people's heads swell, dizzying them, and making them vomit bile.</p>
<p>"Go quickly and report to the ship's comprador. It looks like he's beyond saving!…" A person in the crowd surrounding Old Wang's body, watching him take his last breath, swayed his head and shouted, as if urging Old Wang's relatives by his side. "How pitiful!"</p>
<p>However, Old Wang had no relatives by his side. He was just a lonely person!</p>
<p>"I'll report it for him. Alas, dying on the ship is terrible!" Someone in the crowd responded and came out, dragging his legs up the iron ladder to the comprador's room on the deck.</p>
<p>Old Wang was a man of about fifty years old. His gray hair was already a bit bald. Looking at the black teeth in his mouth, one could tell that he was an old foreigner who had lived in foreign countries for a long time. According to the story from a passenger who came down from the same port with him, he knew a little bit about his background. He (Old Wang) left home at the age of twenty to find life in foreign countries. There was a wife and several sons in his "Tangshan" (China) home. The expenses of the family had to rely on his foreign money. At first, relying on his ox-like brute strength, he worked as a "loader" in Hengfeng Gallery (shop), laboriously earning more than ten yuan a month to send home. Moreover, he would always return to his "Tangshan" home about every three or four years. Although life was not necessarily very extravagant, it was quite comfortable and was envied by his fellow villagers. However, the years were passing by year by year, and at the same time, his strength was also declining year by year. In the past, he didn't feel tired at all carrying a package of two or three hundred catties on his shoulders. His colleagues often joked and praised him, "Old Wang, you are really strong!" Now, needless to say, he couldn't carry things weighing two or three hundred catties, even one or two hundred catties felt a bit too much. Therefore, this time he returned from "Tangshan" partly because he didn't have the strength and no one welcomed him anymore; partly also because the market has been sluggish in recent years and the market has been depressed everywhere. In order to reduce the daily expenses of the shop, most shops were trying to lay off employees. Therefore, Old Wang also lost his job.</p>
<p>After losing his job, the lack of livelihood for his wife in his hometown added a lot of suffering and sorrow to him. In addition, the accumulated injuries from excessive labor in the past erupted like a volcano all at once. So, he fell ill. After recovering from his illness, some old friends finally gathered some money and sent him back to "Tangshan". Two days after the ship left the shore, before crossing the "Qizhou Ocean" in the black water, his illness broke out again.</p>
<p>Old Wang's deeply sunken eyes had slowly closed, and his bony chest had also stopped jumping and was resting quietly. The onlookers took out a light yellow piece of paper to cover his waxy yellow face.</p>
<p>The ship's comprador walked down from the iron ladder, followed by two cooks with coal dust on their bodies. They walked up to Old Wang's corpse, pounding, and roared.</p>
<p>"What bad luck, if you wanted to die, you could have died on the "Mountain" (seamen call land "Mountain"), fool!"</p>
<p>Afterwards, the cooks rolled up Wang's corpse in a mat, added two heavy iron plates on top of the mat, tied it tightly with ropes, and carried it to the deck. At this time, the onlookers followed him like a funeral procession, and everyone's faces showed a sad look.</p>
<p>"Thump," the cooks threw Old Wang's body into the sea, and in an instant the corpse was swallowed by the waves.</p>
<h3>Transition</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>One of the Trivial Records of Returning Home</p>
<p>When I stepped off the ferry, it was about to depart. The cabin was crowded with over a dozen people and several empty carrying poles. Seeing me as a stranger, they respectfully made room for me to sit down.</p>
<p>My memory hasn't faded. As a child, I used to take ferries like this to the city or back home. I would row from the countryside to the city in the morning and row back in the afternoon. This time, the rower was an old boatman around forty years old. He was bare-chested, with a dry tobacco pipe in his mouth, leisurely sitting at the bow, smoking.</p>
<p>The boat started. He forcefully pushed with a pole, and the boat turned around, slowly leaving the shore and heading towards the middle of the river. The muddy river water rubbed against the hull, making a rustling sound. The people on the boat seemed to know each other well. One moment, these few started chatting, and the next moment, they were talking about things in the city with those others. Only I was alone. I quietly listened to the familiar local accent, and for some reason, I felt a bit melancholy.</p>
<p>The damp river wind blew from behind me, puffing up our clothes and caressing the passengers' hair. The woman sitting next to me said irritably:</p>
<p>"Annoying! This damn wind! If the water rises again this year, we're doomed!"</p>
<p>Then, the old man rowing the boat opened his mouth:</p>
<p>"Did you see them in the city? How did it go? Didn't you make the trip for nothing?"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't even talk about it. The hearts of the rich aren't made of flesh, they're made of pig hearts, dog hearts," she said vehemently, suddenly glancing at me. I quickly lowered my head, secretly laughing to myself that she had mistaken me for someone else.</p>
<p>"Think about it, during the war a few years ago, they ran to us overnight, calling us 'Elder,' 'Auntie,' so affectionately, just wishing they could be more amiable. And I never shortchanged them. Now that we're asking for help, we have to suffer their scorn, and she won't even look at you." She said, pointing with her finger and stamping her foot. Because she used so much force, even the boat rocked.</p>
<p>She was a middle-aged woman with a pair of thick arms. Her face had long been painted coffee-colored by the sun. Her upper garment was covered with patches. When she spoke, white foam gathered at the corners of her mouth. There was really nothing about her that distinguished her from a man. She even rolled up her trousers very high, just like the farmers in her hometown.</p>
<p>I saw the boatman with the sunken chest shake his head and sigh. The boat immediately fell silent. The river wind swept past our ears, whistling.</p>
<p>"So, you couldn't borrow any money, is that it?" the boatman asked.</p>
<p>"Money? Guess what she said: 'Business isn't as good as it used to be, I can't move it.' 'Can't move it?' What she wears on her head, what she wears on her hands, what she wears on her fingers, it's all shimmering gold, and she says she's poor? Do you believe it! I even said I'd pay her back when I sold the pig in October, but she just kept pushing it off, saying she didn't have the authority to decide. Isn't that infuriating? Three percent interest a month, did she lose out? One day when there's lightning, that bitch better watch out, lest heaven strike her dead!" She continued to mutter. The people in the boat seemed to be absorbed, and who wasn't worried? Everyone's heart sank after hearing this.</p>
<p>The boat rounded a bend, and the Mazu Temple Pagoda came into view, towering majestically. I hadn't seen this tall pagoda in ten years. Looking at its reflection, at the gentle ripples of the water kissing the embankment, I should have been warming up my childhood dreams, but my heart was just as heavy. I just sat there blankly, lost in thought.</p>
<p>"Third Uncle, I don't have the ferry fare right now, I'll give it to you next time," she said again, her voice a little lower, and wiped the sweat from her forehead with the corner of her shirt. I could definitely find clues about the changes in my hometown over the past ten years from her, but perhaps she was just one of the most honest people, I thought.</p>
<p>The sun was already setting. The tall pagoda dragged a long, thin shadow, lying on the vast river surface, trembling. I thought in another ten minutes, I would be stepping onto my hometown that I had been away from for ten years. The scenery of my hometown must still be the same. This pagoda, this water, hasn't changed at all. But what about the people, my family? Especially in times like these, especially with these honest farm women, who are so poor that they can't even afford the eight copper coins for the ferry fare, giving me this heads-up, how could my heart not be heavy?</p>
<h3>Raincoat</h3>
<p>— Guiying</p>
<p>The sky during the plum rain season is always like a woman suffering from hysteria, with unpredictable moods. Just when a sliver of golden sunlight shines on the steps, before you know it, she frowns and starts to rain down fine droplets.</p>
<p>"The plum rain season is sometimes sunny, sometimes cloudy," he muttered, and couldn't help but think of raincoats. He should say he had raincoats; one new raincoat had a deposit paid, but hadn't been taken from the clothing store, and one old raincoat had already passed the redemption period in the pawnshop. Thus, he hesitated on the steps, unwilling to go to an extremely important banquet.</p>
<p>Like a monkey locked in an iron cage, he paced from one end of the corridor to the other, watching the increasingly dense rain silk splash up from the sky and the cement, slowly dampening the stone steps in front of the steps like an ink painting. So he moved in a little, pacing under a row of long windows, but the raindrops still greedily invaded, and had already sprinkled on his toes here and there. His heart seemed to be hanging in mid-air. He forgot that there was no room for him to retreat in this small space. Suddenly, his back hit the glass window, making a loud, jarring sound, which woke him from his daze. The sky was pouring down rain like a volley of gunfire, and the tips of his shoes were already half wet.</p>
<p>The appointment was definitely not going to be kept, but he wondered how long this plum rain season would last. He actually had two raincoats. The thought of that old raincoat being swallowed up by the pawnshop because he didn't have the money to redeem it made him unwilling. It was when he first graduated from university and fortunately immediately landed a position at the bank that he bought that beautiful raincoat with his first month's salary. But after that new raincoat was bought, the sky hadn't rained once. The sun was very bright every day, smiling gleefully. Occasionally, there would be heavy rain in the middle of the night, as if the house was about to collapse, but the next morning, the golden sun would shine on his window. The cement of the courtyard showed clean squares, and the buildings across the street, washed by the overnight rain, seemed like castles, reflecting the neatly arranged tiles in the light. Of course, the dust that dazzled the eyes rose again in the street. That new raincoat had been piling up in his box for several months, and the first time it was used was to be sent to the pawnshop. Initially, it was for an emergency, and although it could only be pawned for one-third of its original price, he planned to redeem it as soon as he got some money. However, he never had any spare money, and after adding interest twice, it was still forfeited by the pawnshop. What was even more unfortunate was the arrival of a rainy season, like the current plum rain season, with silk droplets drifting every day, as if to pay back the lack of rain in the previous season, never stopping. So he hated the rain, cursing the sky whenever it rained, and resolving to get some money again to buy a raincoat at all costs, even if it meant going hungry for a few days. Finally, his resolve was realized. He ordered a raincoat at the cheapest Western clothing store, paid the deposit, and arranged to pick it up in a week. Within that week, he exerted the greatest willpower to preserve the remaining cash... That should be a miracle, he lost his job. Until now, that raincoat for which he had paid the deposit had probably already been priced and sold by the store. He remembered clearly that there was a prominent line on the order: "All custom-made clothing not claimed within two months will be priced and sold." He calculated that it had been exactly three months since he lost his job. He raised his head, and the sky was as gloomy as his face. The raindrops blurred the glass window, and he could barely see his own haggard face.</p>

<h3>"Sea Burial" SKETCH</h3>
<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>It rained yesterday, I couldn't work, I rested for a day, and my spirit was nourished, so today everyone is very excited, Tian Fang got up early to sing "Boatman's Song", and Miss Fang and Miss Liu also smiled.</p>
<p>Work began, everyone stripped off their backs, barefoot, carrying fishing nets, walked to the sea, Paulu in front, Xiao Chen in the middle, old Wei blindfolded tightly followed behind them, a slogan, everyone shouted broken voice like singing "net song" up. The miserable sound of "Pull! Pull!" really wanted to make people unbearable to hear</p>
<p>The ruthless sun scorched everyone's back skin, soybean-sized beads of sweat, constantly tearing the skin out, the giant rope scraped the shoulders, indistinguishable from blood is sweat, gravel clamshell stabbing the heart, meat made of people, Suí also frequently called pain it? They were able to endure this sacrifice of flesh and blood under the direction of Director Wang, sobbing and swallowing. They are all brave warriors after all.</p>
<p>During the break, Director Wang comforted everyone and said, "You sacrifice, but that's only this time to shoot 'Sea Burial' in your life, which is nothing. You have to know that those fishermen who fight for survival are sacrificing like this every day! Their blood and sweat are scattered by the tide, and their bodies are also buried I don't know where in the sea, I believe that this sacrifice you made for the sake of filming not only increased the "strength" of reality in terms of the play, but also more lessons in your own life experience, you know, you really know the pain of the fishermen from today!" Everyone seemed to accept Director Wang's comfort, and gradually a smile of victory appeared in the bitter smile, which is:</p>
<p>The scorching sun shines.</p>
<p>Big sweat flows out.</p>
<p>Sweat is like a tide.</p>
<p>Droplets gather into the sea.</p>
<h3>Overture to "Little Aunt"</h3>
<p>— Chaoguang</p>
<p>Little aunt is like an eighteen-year-old beloved daughter, just waiting for the inspiration of the spring wind key, "Little aunt" is like a wisp of evening wind skimming a naked shy girl.</p>
<p>Little aunt with lotus petals blooming like a lotus, little aunt with morning mist, water birds, new water chestnuts in autumn pond, little aunt with snake-like body and water-like passion, little aunt with graceful and beautiful changes!</p>
<p>"Little Aunt" is: Husband is frivolous, little aunt is as beautiful as jade, but see little aunt smile, that hear wife cry?</p>
<p>"Little Aunt" is a poem: is Li Bai's "Spring Thoughts", "Little Aunt" is a painting: is Qiu Ying's "Morning Makeup", "Little Aunt" is a novel: like Ye Lingfeng's "Red Angel", "Little Aunt" is a landscape: like Yandang Mountain's "Dragon Qiu Flying Waterfall".</p>
<p>As light as the lake wind, as powerful as the raging tide, as vast as a spring dream, as fragrant as fresh flowers!</p>
<p>Female color is the source of disaster, which can sink the land, love is the fire of trouble, which can spread to the original!</p>
<p>Watching "Little Aunt" is like hugging a beloved daughter under the moon, stealing kisses under the flowers, watching "Little Aunt" is like boating on a lake in the spring with beautiful women.</p>
<h3>Lake Scenery of "Boat Girl"</h3>
<p>Young director Shen Xiling's poetic enthusiasm has deeply infected us in his past works. In "Boat Girl", Mr. Shen gave us more poetic and artistic images.</p>
<p>Xu Lai, a boat lady by the West Lake, lives a peaceful and hard life with her old father in Yunshui Township. However, because her old father is old and weak, he is already a little incompetent in this boating career. Therefore, Gao Gufei, a young and loyal man who is a worker who takes a boat home after finishing work on the lake every day, always helps the old man with the boat after the boat is opened. This pair of young men and women slowly pass on their love for each other.</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei is the only one who sees it, and he doesn't have a wife yet. He always cooks and mends clothes by himself after returning every day, but one day, he was a little late. When he returned home, the rice was cooked and the clothes were mended. He was strange. He thought there must be a ghost in his house. He guarded against it every day, secretly peeping outside his door. This time, he finally saw that there was no ghost, but. His beloved boat lady, from then on, their love history took a step forward.</p>
<p>However, the good times did not last long, and his beloved boat lady was finally deceived into the fire pit by the fake artist. He himself was finally involved in prison for the strike problem.</p>
<h3>Three Modern Women in "Three Modern Men"</h3>
<p>Lianhua has "Three Modern Women", and the performers of these three modern women are Chen Yanyan, Li Zhuozhuo, and the late generation of famous artists, Ms. Ruan Lingyu.</p>
<p>Lianhua has recently created "Three Modern Men", and the performers of these three modern men are the three treasures of Han Langan, Liu Jiqun, and Yin Xiucen. It can be seen how funny it is to perform "Three Modern Men" with these three slender, fat, and rich treasures.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is said that there is also a scene of "Three Modern Women" in "Three Modern Men". These three modern women are naturally not Chen Yanyan, not Li Zhuozhuo, and certainly not the late Ms. Ruan, who? It is Ms. Han Langan, Ms. Liu Jiqun, Ms. Yin Xiucen.</p>
