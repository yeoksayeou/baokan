<h3>美國果將放棄菲律賓乎</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>自上年七月終開始起草至本年二月間宣告完成之菲律賓憲法。將於今日經美總統羅斯福批准。表面上固為菲律賓民族獨立運動之成功。而實際乃美國爭霸策略巧妙之運用也。</p>
<p>溯美之佔菲。當甲午戰爭日本大勝之後。其時列强方在我國劃定勢力範圍。美國不甘落後。遂乘西班牙之敝疲。掠取其地。以為經營遠東之根據。然其地密邇台灣。大足以阻日本南進之雄圖。因此日人銜之甚深。太平洋上日美爭衡之局。遂造端於此。厥後日本與英國結盟。又舉兵大敗帝俄。其勢濅盛而美國富於財貨。在遠東貿易亦著著進展。雙方遂勢均力敵。互相爭雄迨歐戰旣起。日本突據加羅林羣島。以遮斷檀香山菲律賓間之聯絡。美國甚感威脅。亟謀對付。巴黎和會干涉不成。則倡國際聯盟。以加羅林羣島為委任統治地。藉圖挽救。其後華府會議。復糾合各國。重以國際條約箝制之。此皆美國由佔取菲律賓以與日本爭霸於遠東之往事也。</p>
<p>今者太平洋形勢頗為險惡。而美國竟有放棄菲律賓之表示。其故何耶。曰美實未嘗有放棄之意。特以退為進耳。申言之。美國之治殖民地。以本國建立之歷史。及歷來對於國際政治之宣言。恒故作開明之表示。不圖日本卽利用此點。以促起菲人之獨立運動。此美國所戚之苦悶一也。美國本土與菲島遠隔重洋。欲防禦他國之窺伺。在地理上原屬困難。日本旣佔加羅林群島。對於南進政策孟晋不已。更予菲島以威脅。此美國所感之苦悶二也。自世界經濟衰沈以來。美國對於菲律賓農產之輸入。及菲律賓人之入境。漸威不安。在復興運動之推進上。尤為急需解决之一大問題。此美國所感之苦悶三也。有此三點。益以九一八以來。日本亟亟進行其亞細亞門羅主義之工作。在加羅林羣島復布置軍事設備。甚且不顧一切。退出國際聯盟。宣言廢棄華府會議所訂之條約。於是美國迫於事勢。不得不有此以退為進之計畫焉。</p>
<p>此就國際關係言之也。再由軍事行動方面加以觀察。則美國海軍在太平洋上之行動。向以巴拿馬運河及舊金山檀香山為中心。注目於南太平洋。今年之操演。乃擇地於舊金山檀香山與阿拉斯加之間。且有建港於阿留申島荷蘭港之議。美國軍事行動。旣轉移其重心。在菲律賓當然應作退守之計。然此亦僅退守而已。不足以言放棄也。去年决定之泰定士菲島獨立案雖已徇菲人請求。允於宣佈獨立之後撤退所駐陸軍。但仍申明海軍根據地暫行保留。且自泰定士案開始實行以來。美國對於菲島政治上之控制。實未嘗放鬆一步。菲島制憲會議所提之國防計畫。卽被莫飛總督退回。聲言在斐島完全獨立以前。美國仍負保護之責。國防問題尙非切要。此舉意義伺如。不待智者能明矣。况憲法中明定菲島建立共和政府後仍承認美國宗主權。官吏必須宣誓對美效忠。獨立云何哉。不寗唯是。在經濟方面。且見其控制之手段更進一步焉。統制進口貨。採行比例制。則保護美貨排除日貨之政策。將假手於共和政府。以堅决執行之矣。若夫限制菲人赴美。强制管理菲棉生產。禁止菲糖輸入美國。以及最近赴美菲島代表團與美國官塲間商務談話暫時停止等事實。尤可見美人以許予菲島獨立之美名。一舉而解除上述三重苦悶之妙用矣。</p>
<p>職是之由。吾人對於美總統批准菲律賓憲法之舉。一方固認為菲律賓民族運動相當之成功。而對其民族為獨立自由而奮鬥之精神。深表同情。然同時亦不能不指出美國並無完全放棄菲島之意思。而美國之許予菲島獨立。亦未足解除日美間在太平洋上之糾紛與問題也。</p>

<p>條例規定股東通過</p>
<p>中國交通兩銀行條例第二條規定、「因業務上之必要、須增加股本時、得由股東總會議决、呈請財政部核准增加之、」新聲社記者、昨日特向中國交通兩銀行探悉、該兩行之本屆通常股東總會、均已分別定期在滬舉行、業已通告各股東在案、對於財政部發行民國二十四年金融公債、撥增該兩行資本案、决提交本屆通常股東總會通過、再依照條例規定、呈請財政部核准增加云云、</p>

<h3>工部局討論結果　准許電話加價　至多一成二分五須法租界同意　其他關於管理酬勞等另行核議</h3>
<p>上海電話公司陳清工部局、於本年四月起、改訂收費價目、現在工部局已允許公司方面、增加總收入至多百分之十二·五、公司方面、須另行擬具收費新章、斟酌分配、再候核議决定、又據公司方面嚴近聲稱、近兩個半月之內、電話數减少約一千具之譜、而先前之約計、則以為可增加八百具、因此出入之間、今後收入、將運不及預料之多、茲將該公司陳請書內容摘要、及工部局公用委員會討論情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>資產負債</p>
<p>據公司之報告、以一九三四年而論、投資項下有股本八百零五萬二千元、（均照中國國幣計算、千位以下省略）公司債二千四百六十七萬五千元、一年期以上之借欵二百零九萬八千元、總計為三千四百八十二萬五千元、公司之收入、計是年話費等收入六百六十二萬五千元、開支項下、計話務費一百零二萬五千元、維持費八十七萬五千元、業務費六十九萬五千元、折舊一百五十九萬七千元、捐稅十四萬元、共開支四百三十三萬二千元、再除去利息等支付十三萬餘元、計得純益二百十五萬九千元、合投資額約為百分之六·一三、</p>
<p>收費新法</p>
<p>按據公司之特許合同、自去年四月起、公司應得純益年息一分、卽八厘利為、再加二厘之預備金、故依公司方面之計算、照一九三四年之數目、收入項下（尙虧短一百三十六萬二千元之譜、為補足此項虧短起見、項使現在話費之收入、平均增多百分之二十三（二十二·八九）光景、公司為此擬議改訂收費辦法、共中最主要者、為將商業用之電話、一律改為按次計算之收費新法、</p>
<p>商用電話</p>
<p>查現行商業用之電話、其收費係分兩種、一種係固定的、每月每綫十二元二角四分、一種則限定三百次以內為十二元二角四分、五百次以內十三元八角、七百次以內十五元六角九分、七百次以上每次加收五分五厘九毫、公司方面、擬一律改為按次收費、計一百次以內、每月一律十元、由一百至二百次、每次加收五分、二百至三百次、每次加收四分、三百次以上、每次均加收三分、</p>
<p>住宅電話</p>
<p>至住宅用電話、現在話費每月合七元五角八分、公司方面、擬增為八元五角、此外自用專綫、延長綫及分綫、與分綫交換機等費、皆有增加、而掉機及重接費、則予减少、其裝設及移置費、從前一律收十三元九角九分者、今後擬改為商用者十五元、家用者十元、總計各項增减之結果、約計可將總收入增多百分之二十二·八九、照此辦法、則公司自今年四月一日起、至一九三七年四月一日止、約可得純益、平均為每年百分之一〇·〇八、</p>
<p>討論經過</p>
<p>該公司請求增價一案、業經工部局公用委員詳細討論、同時匯票經紀人公會、日本僑民團體·及上海市商會·等各公團、均致函工部局、表示異議、在公司方面、計算損益之基礎、如關於應付美國之所得稅問題、折舊準備金問題付與國際電報電話公司之管理酬金問題、皆有研究之必要、而公司方面之預測、謂按次數收費後、通話次數將减少一半、似亦本免過於樂觀、據財務處長意見、所得稅一項、（據公司計算、今後兩年需八十五萬元、）不在合同範圍之內、不應由用戶担負折舊一項、前年年終、工部局曾以貸欵協助公司、將其所負之金洋債務、改換為銀幣債務、因此投資方面、應减少三百萬元之數計算、而每年之折舊額、亦可因之大减、至付與國際公司之管理酬金、每年係按總收入之百分四·五計算、約需三十萬元之譜、此事亦不應令上海長久負此電担、故依財務處長之意見、如公司收入每年能增百分之十二·五、卽足使公司獲得一分純益、至其加價之分配項目、應再加以斟酌、據公司之意見、如股東不能獲得相當之利息、則將來欲再籌募資本、必感困難、但財務處長云、如照十二·五之額收後、股東實已可獲得約一分五之紅利、且將來擴張、並不再需巨欵、且或可由本埠籌募、惟以工部局之地位而萬、其他公用事業、旣皆可按時分紅、似不能不許電話公司以相當之利得、且近今十五個月以來、公司之經營費、已經節省約每年四十萬元之譜、而其工務上之效率、亦無問題、再則照公司方面兩年前之計算、增價需在四成以上、方能達到合同所許之條件、經用種種方法應付、今之所增、不過百分之十二·五、是對於用戶之利益、已可謂有合理之保障矣、</p>
<p>許可增加</p>
<p>此案經公用委員會詳細斟酌後、乃决定建議於董事會、許該公司自本年四月一日起、增加收入至多百分之十二·五、但須同時得法租界當局之同意、而加費之支配辦法、亦須兩租界許可、至其他關於所得稅、折舊金·管理酬勞等問題、另行核議、</p>

<p>兩團來華各有任務</p>
<p>該兩考察團、所取名稱、雖近雷同、但所負任務、則各有目的也、查美國洛山磯商會組織之遠東商業考察團、其目的、僅在明瞭最近美國在華商業狀况、俾今後對華貿易有所認識、蓋全係含有商業性質之組織、至美國國際貿易協會組織之遠東經濟考察團、所負任務、較為重大、該團目的、在搜集關於中美貿易上所需要之各種材料、及美國在華投資情形、並與我國研究發展中美貿易辦法、故其所負使命、對中美整個貿易前途、實含有重要意味、</p>

<h3>日警務局決定　以孔孟敎訓為敎育方針</h3>
<p>日本眞能尊重孔孟之道乎</p>
<p>世界新聞社云、據東報載、日內務省所屬警務局對於全國各警官學校、現决定實施敎育之新方針、即以中國孔孟之敎訓為敎育基本、務期發揚東方治平之道、一方將原有之國際法及其他法律的課程式全廢或减少、認為此等科目於今後之警務維持者無甚用處、查警務局此項方針變更之用意、在注重警員道德心之養成、而於習識方面認為次要、此項新方針、定於四月一號起實施、該局並將編印一種定期刊物、闡明此項旨趣、以期全國現役警員六萬三千名咸受此新方針之統制云、</p>
<h3>文化建設協會　浙分會幹事長派定</h3>
<p>中國文化建設協會浙江分會、昨接總會函開、特指派許紹棣為該會幹事長、劉湘女項定榮為副幹事長、卽日開始工作云、</p>
<h3>陳鶴琴　對於注音漢字之談話</h3>
<p>本月十三日報載黎錦熙覆舒新城討論開鑄注音漢字銅模事、敎育家陳鶴琴氏對此曾發表意見、略謂報紙所載、語言不詳、玩其辭意、大概並不主張注音符號代替漢字、而主張用符號注明正音、俾讀者對於文字不致有讀不出音的苦楚、對於此點、鄙人以為釐訂正確國音字典供小學敎師遵照施敎、及學生自行翻閱、已足完成其使命、至民眾讀物及小學敎科書、全數用注音漢字排印之計劃、似大可不必、為勉强實行、恐有下列諸端之弊、</p>
<p>（一）費時　注音符號與文字並列、對於生字固屬需要、然每課書中生字極其有限、如果對於已讀過之熟字、亦一律附加注音、則學生閱讀時眼睛方面勢必多費功夫、且文字符號、排在一起、極易淆亂視覺、分散注意敎學費時是不待言、</p>
<p>（二）耗目力　兒童目力不比成人、在現今一般敎科書之字體、閱讀時有時或感困難、如再附加注音字母、更不易觀看明淅、耗費目力、極易引起近視危險殊甚、</p>
<p>（三）易差誤　觀看旣不易淸楚、則差誤之機會是必加多、且字與符號混合一起、幼年兒童每易誤認符號為文字之一部分、因而發生差誤、</p>
<p>（四）應先從事研究　在美國對於文字閱讀的難易、會用攝影方汰、詳細試騐、結果甚佳、關於注音漢字一事、關係甚大、最好先由國內大學校或專門敎育機關、試騐及研究一過、再斟酌實行、否則恐非徒少益、或且有害也云、</p>

<h3>德國科學和中國圖書（下）</h3>
<p>— 德國圖書館委員傑琴博士者</p>
<p>再就上海而論、互助會又把一部份的工業書籍捐贈交通大學、把關於國民經濟的書籍捐贈中央大學商學院、同時和復旦大學、同濟大學、以及其他各研究室、無不發生密切的聯絡關係、同濟大學尤為互助會特別的注意、且予以經常的帮助、雖然德國內部的經濟十分困難、可是對於同濟大學、却依然不惜捐贈巨價的善本、</p>
<p>互助會和中央研究院發生關係、至今已有數年、在不久以前、互助會曾有長篇的報告發表、目的在使德國人知道互助會的合作試騐、一種使中國的科學生活系統化的試騐、互助會在努力地和中國各方面發生關係的時候、同時也希望和圖書館發生同樣的關係、使每一種交往、成為相互的交往、這是本文應該說明的、</p>
<p>德國學術互助會對於圖書館的帮助、並不像美國人的專務外表、德國學術互助會的意志、在以德文的書籍、贈送於中國的圖書館、或用來交換中國書籍、藉以充實中國圖書館的內容、而尤以能得中國方面的捐贈圖書、引為莫大的榮幸、</p>
<p>再就中國的故都北平而言、互助會早已和北平圖書館發生了密切的聯絡、互助會捐贈該館的書籍、已有植物學者Landolt—Bornstein的鉅著以及地理學考古學之類、此外關於德國語言和文學的書籍、所捐贈者亦已不在少數、在北平方面、又因該館的介紹、互助會和其他方面發生錯綜的關係、如燕京大學圖書館·北京大學圖書館·北京大學·淸華大學圖書館·北平研究院·國民大學·中央觀象臺·輔仁大學圖書館等、都已有密切的聯絡、</p>
<p>在廣州方面、亦有同樣的關係、尤以中山大學圖書館和中山大學更為密切、其他的機關學校、如嶺南大學、敎授、私人間、如汪敎授、也都有很密切的關係、可是互助會的和北平廣州間的關係、幾乎是全屬交換性質的、</p>
<p>位於長江中心的武漢三鎭、因為互助會代替武漢大學收集大批德文書籍的起因、也已經和互助會發生了關係、武漢大學的書籍、都是駐華德國公使陶德曼博士用個人名義捐贈的、其中都是傳記·歷史·法律·古代作品·物理以及化學一類的書籍、</p>
<p>在南京方面、互助會現下正與國立中央圖書館的蔣復璁先生極為接近、即如中央大學圖書館、以及國民政府衛生署等、也都有相當的聯絡、此外、如杭州的浙江大學、浙江省立圖書館、香港的香港大學、皇家研究院、也都是同互助會有關係的、</p>
<p>要詳舉中國方面與互助會有關係的機關、學校和集團、當然不免於辭費、不過、除了原有關係的機關以外、若有他方面的圖書館、因為讀了本文而需要互助會有所帮助時、本會當然不辭勞瘁、不避艱辛、一定會有相當的援助、藉以獲得對方的同情和互助的、</p>

<h3>小科學家</h3>
<p>— 白桃</p>
<p>現代兒童是一個小科學家。小科學家所幹的是些小實騐，小改革，小發明。他要玩活的把戲，不讀死的科學敎科書。</p>
<p>小科學家當然也得用書，但他用的是活書：山水草木，虫烏魚獸是活書，雲雨風雪，日月星辰，宇宙之大微生物之小，都是活書</p>
<p>整個的宇宙是小科學家所用的科學敎科書，也就是小科學家的偉大試騐室。要求得眞實的知識，要打開自然界一切神秘的謎，都要在偉大的試驗室裏，來活用這些書本才行</p>
<p>其實，小朋友們生來，就是這大試驗室裏的，一位小科學家。天空打雷，他要追問：「那是為什麼？」蜘蛛吃蚊虫，他要看：「那是在做什麼？」而世界上有名的大科學家，大發明家，都是用了這些活書，在這偉大的試騐室裏磨練出來的。例如達爾文，牛頓，加利略便是一個很好的例子。所以小科學家們，都是將來有希望的大學問家，大發明家。只要諸位小朋友，不要忘掉這些寶量員的活書，和這座偉大的試驗室。</p>
<h3>文藝故事</h3>
<p>— 孫育才</p>
<p>（一）民族英雄石達開</p>
<p>石達開是太平天國的名將，他不但精於軍事，而且深通文學。當時諸將爭權，自相殘殺，石達開眼看得這新興的革命政府，决不濟事了，就單獨領了一支兵，直趨四川，意欲再圖大舉，不料獨木難支，終於失敗。據官家報告，石達開兵敗後，卽為淸兵擒殺；但據野史記載，石達開郤並未遭擒，自然也不曾被殺。不錯，這樣的民族英雄，我們那個願意他遇害呢？</p>
<p>現在單說他一椿故事；不知怎麼，他的敵人曾國藩也愛上他的才能，苦苦寫信去勸他投降。像石達開這樣一個革命家，當然絕不是封建代表的曾國藩所招致的，他做了四首詩，予以嚴正的拒絕。這詩中有兩句道：</p>
<p>『我志未酬人亦苦：東南到處有啼痕　。』</p>
<p>從這兩句詩，我們可以看出他對於民生疾苦的關心，而不失為一個革命家的本色。這一片仁厚之心，不要說那時候的諸將沒有，就是在現代也何嘗多得呢</p>
<p>（二）年羹堯問字</p>
<p>年羹堯是淸朝的一員大將，曾經征西藏，定川邊，平靑海，功績很偉大。</p>
<p>據說他年幼的時侯，就很聰明，他的父親特為他請了幾位先生來家敎導，可是沒有一位先生不是被他為難而自己情願告退的。</p>
<p>有一次，他的父親請了一位本地很有名的先生來敎他，年羹堯第一天上學，便寫了個『重』字，問那位先生道：『這「重」字怎麼解釋？』</p>
<p>『「重」字是不輕的意思。』老師答。</p>
<p>『不對，不對，把重字拆開來，便是千里二字，明明是很遠的意思，怎麼說是不輕呢？』年羹堯笑喜喜的說。</p>
<p>老師聽了，面上脹得緋紅，默然無語。</p>
<p>第二天年羹堯又寫了一個矮字和『射』字問老師道。『這二個字怎樣解釋？』</p>
<p>『這「矮」字是不高的意思，所以稱人體不高的人，呌矮子：「射」字是把箭發出去的意思。』老師答。</p>
<p>『照先生的解釋是不對的，依我看來，應該把「矮」和「射」兩個字調換一下方對。你看「射」字是從寸身兩字合攏來的，人的身體旣然只有一寸，豈不是矮麼？至於「矮」字；明明是矢委二字合成的，「矢」是箭，「委」是棄掉的意思，把箭棄掉不就是表示發箭嗎？』年羹堯哈哈大笑的說。</p>
<p>『中國人造字委實顚倒極了，譬如「牛」和「魚」兩個字，照理也要互相掉換一下方對。」年羹堯又繼續着說。</p>
<p>『這又是什麼道理呢？』老師吃驚似地問。</p>
<p>「魚」字明明是像形的四足動物，「牛」字却才是一條有頭有尾而沒有脚的水裏動物，怎麼又把他顛倒過來講呢！』年羹堯說。</p>
<p>老師覺得年羹堯的天才，委實了不得，自已沒有才學足以敎導他，睡在床上思索了一夜，東方旣白，便辭館而去。</p>

<h3>老母雞</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>老母雞咯咯地呌着，牠覺得自己的身世很可憐，沒有生幾個孩子來陪伴它的寂寞。它到處這樣賽凉的呌喚：「咯咯咯！多寂寞！咯咯咯！多寂寞！」</p>
<p>有一天，它從草窠裏爬出幾個蛋來，它很歡喜，現在它可以孵小雞出來安慰它寂寞了。它立刻把草堆整理成像它住的窠一樣。又把蛋放在草窠當中，很小心地把身體蹲伏在蛋的上面。一面用翼翅掩着這幾個蛋，一面耐心地等候着小雞從蛋殼裏鑽出來。它想：甜蜜的日子快要來到了。</p>
<p>日子一天天過去，今天已經是母雞孵蛋後的第三個星期日了。老母雞咯咯的呌喚，已經顯得很愉快，歡樂。它把翼翅輕輕地收歛足來，立刻聽得蛋殼裏面有「嚶嚶」的呌聲。老母雞眞是快活極了。他呌着：「咯咯咯！多快樂！咯咯咯！多快樂！」</p>
<p>母雞的希望實現了，蛋殼裏都鑽出孩子來，老母雞便帶着它出去尋食。它一路「咯咯」地呌喚着，孩子們都圍住在它身邊。可是牠很奇怪，為什麼孩子的樣子完全不像它自己。它們的嘴是扁扁的，身體是長長的，脚梗是矮矮的，連它們的呌聲都是「希呀」「希呀」的，這不禁使老母雞懷疑了。</p>
<p>它們走到池塘邊，老母雞正預備敎他們啄食的方法，但這羣孩子却都向池水中跳下去了！老母雞急急的呌喚起來：「咯咯咯！快來救！咯咯咯！快來救！」老母鴨聽了這呌喚的聲音，趕快跑到池塘邊來。老母雞喊道：「咯咯咯！孩子把要溺死了！」老母鴨「呷呷呷」的大笑起來：「這是我的孩子呀」它也急急地跳下水中去了。</p>
<p>老母雞呆呆地望着它們，只見它們很快活的在水中游泳。只得「咯咯咯」地走回草窠裏。</p>
<p>植物自衛抗敵，不儘是用可惡的氣味。有許多植物，都生來有自衛的武器，像棘刺之類，動物要是去咬它們，口就會被刺破的。有些植物有剛毛，可以抵制那些貪饞的蝸牛之類。還有些植物能分泌粘液，用來防禦昆蟲的攻擊。</p>
<p>關於植物的自衛，我們不妨再舉出發個實例來說一說。薄荷有特殊的芬香，我們常用它作藥品，但是食草動物很怕它那種氣味。毛苾，山躑躅等，都是有毒的植物，食草動物，對於它們，都是不敢嘗一嘗的。</p>
<p>栗的果實，外面生滿了刺：山　向枸橘的莖上都有刺；小蘗的葉子下面，也有根刺：薊的莖和葉，都生滿了刺：貓兒刺的葉子邊像緣多有像針樣的鋸齒：對於這些有刺的植物，食草動物，是　也不敢掽的。七葉樹的芽，捕蟲瞿麥的莖，都能分泌粘液，防禦昆蟲的進攻。蕁麻的枝葉都有剛毛，又含毒汁，你要是一不小心，趣着了它，他那剛毛就會刺破你的皮膚，把毒汁注射到你的血裏，那是怪疼痛的。</p>
<p>植物雖說有各種自衛的方法，却仍有一部分動物能傷害他們的。不過像這些有惡劣氣味的和有刺的植物，到底跟他們作對的動物很少了。只有少數的動物，才敢侵犯他們；那麼，他們在生存競爭上，就很占優勢了。</p>
<h3>植物怎樣自衛</h3>
<p>— 董純才</p>
<p>不論植物動物，都有天生的自衛本領。跟動物和人一樣，植物也有很多的仇敵和危險。在這弱肉强食的自然界中，那些不能自衛抗敵的植物，結果都要歸於滅亡，只有那些强壯的才能生有存。</p>
<p>有許多的蟲·魚·烏·獸，都要傷害植物。植物必得難力自衛，才能生存。當然，植物不會像動物那樣跟敵人戰鬥：它們也不會逃跑：但是它們確有許多抵抗那些貪食的敵人的自衛方法。</p>
<p>有些植物有種難聞的臭氣，很少動物要吃它們有些植物有毒汁，使那些要吃它們的食草動物，也不敢嘗試；有些植物有種酸澀的或辛辣的味道，使人嘗了一口，就不敢再嘗第二次了。雖沒有惡劣氣味的植物，也有些動物歡喜吃，但是大多數食草動物却知道不去光顧它們的。</p>
<h3>故事畫</h3>
<p>— 張友鑑</p>
<p>—到大海裏去—</p>
<p>（一）榮兒拿了釣竿，立在船沿上釣魚。</p>
<p>（二）船艙裏的廚司正在破一條大魚：忽見窗口飛進了一個釣鈎，恰巧釣住了大魚的嘴吧。</p>
<p>（三）榮兒把釣竿拉起；想不到鈎到了一條沒有尾巴的大魚。</p>
<p>（四）肥兒見了，就想拿去自己燒來吃，便假裝着驚駭的樣子，說道：「這是船艙裏釣得來的，應該還他，讓我拿去還給他。』說罷，就從榮兒的手上搶下了大魚和釣竿。</p>
<p>（五）廚司拿着剩下的尾巴來對，這條魚果然是自己的。可是肥兒不肯還給他，就想逃走。</p>
<p>（六）廚司恨極了，飛起一脚向肥兒踢去，肥兒就跌了一個天觔斗翻到大海裏去。</p>
<h3>兒童用書問題</h3>
<p>— 黃一德</p>
<p>「二十四紀的新發見，是兒童的發見。自從這句話說出後，好似我們中國的兒童敎育，漸形重視起來。同時，我們的出版界呢，在這幾年來，對於兒童讀物的出版，也如「雨後春筍」</p>
<p>這不能不說是中國兒童的福音。</p>
<p>但中國的兒童，不幸而為中國的兒童。中國是國恥重重的中國，是國弱民貧的中國，是一切落後的中國：這樣的一個國家底兒童用書問題，實在是一個嚴重的問題並不是隨便出版一點兒童讀物，就算是對於兒童敎育，有所助益，對於兒童文化，有所貢獻。</p>
<p>你來一套兒童文庫，我也來一套兒童文庫；你出兒童讀物二百冊，我出兒童讀物三百冊。這是為文化而競爭？為營業而競爭？且不說他，「多多益善」，現象是好的。中國敎育未普及，敎育晋及之後，出幾千冊，幾萬冊，幾十萬冊也不為多。只是最切要的一個問題，應少出「兒童讀物」，多出「兒童用書」。「兒童讀物」，是消極的，「兒童用書」是積極的。這樣的一個國家的兒童，並不需要消極的隨便看看的「讀物」，而需要積極，動手去做的「用書」。因為這樣的一個中國的兒童，實在沒有閒心看閒書，實在沒有閒錢買閒書啦！</p>
<p>那末這樣的一個國家的兒童，應該給與什麼用書呢？這就是本會——中國兒童文化協會應該努力的工作之一了。我們希望社會人士，學校敎師，家庭父母，能給我們以助力。</p>
<h3>水手辛白德傳（二）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>那船主走到我跟前來說道：「我有一包貨物，是一個人帶上船來和我們一起出發的。如今他已死了，我要賣掉了這貨物，將金錢付給他的後裔。你要是有意接受了，代我出賣，那麼你賣去之後，我給你一筆錢酬你的勞。」</p>
<p>我樂於做這回事，因為我是喜歡工作的。那船主便喚船中書記將我領取的包作開一張淸單</p>
<p>他說：「用水手辛白德的名義寫下來。」</p>
<p>我聽了迢些話，心中充滿了快樂。便給船主知道我，他以為我已死了。起初他還記不起來</p>
<p>這也無怪他不知道我，因為我近來的生活，已使我身上大有變動了。</p>
<p>諸位也一定以為我應當立刻認識他了，但我須得和你們說，他便是我第二次航行時船上的領袖，自我上一次和他相見以來，已過了好久好久的時光了。</p>
<p>我說：「我便是那辛白德，你先前所遺留在」座島上的。那時我在一條溪邊睡熟了，醒回來時却見船已遠去。</p>
<p>船主道：「咦！我此刻認識你了！因了怎樣不幸的機會把你遺留在島上，我不能說。那時我們所有的人都回到船上，而我却不知道你遺落了。一陣大風刮起來時，我們纔不見你在船上，而又不能駛回去。」</p>
<p>我很快樂見他把我的貨物在各埠做得好賣買，所以他把金錢和貨物一起交給我。</p>
<p>我們從薩白拉島開駛到一個所在，我在那邊積存着各種名貴的香料。</p>
<p>我在這裏瞧見好些奇怪的東西，有的模樣兒像母牛的一尾魚，一隻極大的龜，和還有許多東西。</p>
<p>過了些時我們到了白爾沙拉，從那邊動身上白克達，屆時便到了這鎭中。我此時已很富了，凡是我所有的算不勝算。我把大批的令錢給窮人，又在我所有的以外，添買了許多地產。</p>
<h3>春天的蜜蜂</h3>
<p>— 走肖</p>
<p>小朋友們，現在只要你們肯走到郊野去遊玩一下，便可以看見各色各樣的花朶，紅的，黃的，紫的，白的，……東也有，西也有，那種欣欣向榮的景象，眞是看了够高興了。還有那一羣羣的蜜蜂兒，也是到處都能給你們看見，一會兒飛到東，一會兒飛到西，是多麼好看呀！</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們以為那一羣羣的蜜蜂，都在那郊野間遊玩嗎？要是你們這樣想，那就寃枉着們了。們並不是在遊玩，們實在是在辛勤地幹着正當工作呵！們幹什麼工作？你們都懂嗎？</p>
<p>們都是在幹着「採花釀蜜」的工作呵！</p>
<p>們能辛勤地幹着工作，所以們會，產生出甜蜜的糖來。們製造出來的糖，是多麼甜美呵，並且經過了這一季辛勤，們一年的食糧，都預備好了，所以永遠也不會受到飢餓的痛苦！小朋友們，你們聽見蜜蜂餓死的消息嗎？我肯定的告訴你們，們是不會這樣的。因為們個個都肯辛勤地工作呵！</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們在年幼的時侯，也好像們在這春天一樣呵，那末，現在們是那樣辛勤工作着，你們在這時候，也應該如何去努力，才不致愧對們呢？我希望你們比們還要加倍努力才好哩！</p>

<h3>紗花　美棉帶高標紗花</h3>
<p>紗市連朝大跌之後、顯現反動之象、同時美棉繼續上升、致人心轉挺、兼之本月份多頭仍不川籠、故漲勢愈激、又穿出一百八十元關外、不過現紗客方需要較前為淡、但有一部份、看其有一度回風、</p>
<p>本月紗出八十元</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉趨漲、塲中賣者缺乏、　面轉緊、浮戶抵　、且已跌多曰、一遇良好消息、反動力愈強、本月份某君之多頭、按兵不動、故漲風尤足、遠月亦受其牽制、結果本月份比上日收盤價漲一元六角、其餘各月期均漲一元一二三四角、午後開盤、仍無極大變化、市象較為安定、本月份比上午收盤價又漲二角、遠月漲跌一二三角、查賣出益大二千六百包、大豐一千三百五十包、泰昌九百五十包、振大九百包、信　四百包、泰典五百五十包、達記四百五十包、買進同興六百包、仁豐七百五十包、大孚一千七百包、森康六百包、益昶八百包、長豐一千三百包、潤康一千六百包、恒昌五百包、一日聞最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>花市趨堅、美棉繼續、查其來電云、開盤市况呆滯、至收盤時因政治消息利於多頭、及空盤抵補、市價驟漲、印棉亦漲、故人心轉昂、空頭活動抵補、市盤乃升、但大戶空方、仍無舉動、不過查美棉現貨較低時已漲起九十五磅音</p>
<p>鄭標回好三角半</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月均呈反動回漲之勢、形勢挺秀、實因已多日美棉繼漲三十餘磅昔、印棉亦漲四羅比、致空頭活動抵補、買風稍起、市盤乃昂、結果各月價比上日收盤價均漲二角至三角、午後開盤市態平淡、但賣方壓迫仍烈、然海外棉市消息良好、印棉暗盤漲二羅比半、檯峯尙緊、結果近月比上午價相同、遠月均漲五分、查賣出賡豐一千二百擔、益裕一千六百擔、大豐三千八百擔、達記一千九百擔、均昶一千七百、愼記一千九百擔、義成二千二百搶、生源一千八百担、永大一千二百担、益豐七千一百擔、買進穗隆一千二百擔、大孚四千七百擔、長豐五千二百擔、益昶二千擔、潤康二千四百擔、信誠二千七百擔、新享一千八百擔、源興昌二千四百擔、仁豐二千四百擔、同興二千一百擔、泰昌一千六百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美棉抵空突起</h3>
<p>—回漲二三十磅音—</p>
<p>昨美棉閒盤堅穩、三月期交易至午刻為止、價因交割通知達七、八〇〇包而跌、大部份為現貨商所吸收、賣戶不多、同業仍進、日本購買陳棉、新買戶缺乏、同業等候華盛頓方面之發展、其後聞衆議院通過派脫門恩給金條例、空戶紛紛抵補、市價轉堅、同時小麥及股票上漲、亦助棉市興奮、海斯脫估計本週廠用二六三、〇〇〇包、利物浦存底三〇七、〇〇〇包、收盤時趨勢甚昂、計現貨漲二十五磅音、期貨漲二十三至三十四磅音、英棉現貨跌五點、期貨漲三點、印棉初因空戶賣出及多頭了結而疲、後因現需良好及商買進而堅、計平果爾漲四·五羅比、奧姆辣漲五日·七五羅比、白羅溪漲一·七五羅比、原電錄左、（二十三日電）</p>

<h3>上週美棉受歐洲時局而銳落</h3>
<p>紐約廿二日來電報吿一週中之棉市云、週初市况又形銳落、緣多頭了結及套賣重起、蓋所以保護其存貨或存棉者、且歐洲政局混沌、而外匯復不定也、其後以空頭抵補及同業買進而阻其跌風、但需要沉滯、所以趁勢亦上落不定矣、聞南方參議員贊成政府之繼續貸欵政策川口之鼓勵、以及乎續稅之停徵、頗引起反動、業中人則均待當局之舉動、衆院過通彭海氏案中對農人之生產三包者免稅一節、恐將遇强力之反對也、現貨無軟象、當星期一下跌之後、套賣極少云、</p>

<p>婦女園地</p>
<h3>急與迷</h3>
<p>— 碧梧</p>
<p>正在大人先生們茶餘酒後的高談闊論着「婦女應跑回家庭」的當兒，而婦女自殺的新聞，便每日每日雪一樣地飛來：這一個無聲的，具體的回答，未免太凄凉慘酷！</p>
<p>近日更於接二連三的自殺新聞之餘，忽來一個轟動全國的劉景桂殺人案：自殺，殺人，一九三五年的中國女界，幾乎是殺成一片。可是在這血腥的凄苦的空氣之中，又夾着一些滑稽的，使人　笑的資料，最顯著的是姚某的女化男身的宣傳。</p>
<p>為甚麽如今的女界會有這許多花樣？這些花樣中有甚麽共同的因綠？</p>
<p>自殺，許多人都已認為是弱者的行為，殺人，可就應該當作强者的行為了。然而未必。觀於劉景桂的談話：「今天來這裏，是專來打滕爽，因為伊之丈夫「卽　明」是我從前之未婚夫。本來是伊丈夫欺騙我，我本意要將伊丈夫打死，因為我能力達不到，所以將伊打死」。這話很明白，殺人的劉景桂，也遝是被壓迫得氣憤不過的弱者——女人。</p>
<p>至於姚某的以女子而假稱已變了男人，是因大多數的人還以為男尊女卑，女子而能一旦變為男兒，必是那人有特別的感天的精誠，然後有此果報然則姚某的這套空城計，恰是弱女子無可奈何時不得已的戲法。</p>
<p>弱女子到了走頭無路時，便發為自殺或殺人或墮落烟花或變把戲。</p>
<p>她如何會這般弱？因為她沒有權力，沒有社會地位，沒有希望，給與她的是一個窄小的家和一席奴隸的身分。她對於世界一切都觀得空虛，一切的金錢，權力，藝術，名譽，都不屬於她。她所看見的最實在的最重要的就是她自身，為了自己一身的問題，可以自暴自棄的自殺，也可以自暴自棄地殺人，更可以自暴自棄地玩其他的把戲。而且在她的情形，卽使她不自暴自棄，社會有時也逼得她不得不如此做。</p>
<p>近來婦女界不幸的事件日多，所說明的就是婦女在社會的地位日更薄弱。「婦女跑回家庭去」！良妻賢母主義復活，加重了她新的，比數年以前更重的壓迫，剝削了她以前僅有的少許的解放的希望。生活上，思想上，都只給她打擊而不給她光明的出路，她只有迷迷沉沉地亂撞。</p>
<p>然而，「飢不擇食」，雖是千年的古話，究竟有糾正的餘地。無論怎樣飢渴，總不能吃毒物或搶奪他人的救命之羹以為餐。婦女在今日，誠然威受飢渴同樣的急迫，但急迫之中仍不能昏迷地亂撞。與其有自殺，殺人，以及各種無謂的自暴自棄的勇氣，何如用來和這社會戰鬥？只要能戰勝生活上思想上的各種束縛，我們是有男人同樣重要的人生。整個的社會在世界的地位日低，我們婦女才有今日的新壓迫，新束縛；我們不去爭婦女在社會的平等地位和社會在世界的平等地位，徒然自己毁滅，不是正當的方法。</p>
<p>別把個人的舒適，戀愛，虛榮列為第一，而當以社會的光明為前提。社會不需要人自暴自棄而需要人勇敢奮鬥犧牲，時勢雖然急迫，我們婦女萬不能自甘示弱，至迷入於破滅的路程。</p>
<h3>戀愛與殺人</h3>
<p>— 茲九</p>
<p>「誰殺害了阮玲玉」的檢討，尙占着許多報紙的篇幅時，忽又來了一件三角情殺的新聞，各報紙又用着頭號字的標題，以示此事的嚴重與奇特。慘案的主角劉景桂，北平北美美術學校學生，會與體育家逮明戀愛，而訂有婚約，然不久逮明於華北運動會中，得識志成中學體育敎員滕爽，於是以六百元之代價，與劉景桂解約，而與滕爽結婚，劉景桂從此含恨入骨，矢志報復。終於鎗殺了情敵滕爽，而自己做了囚徒。殺人是自尋死路，劉景桂當然也了然，這使殺人自囚的社會意義，當也不减於「誰殺害了阮玲玉」一問題的嚴重，听以也引起了多方的注意。</p>
<p>本月二十日晨報，有林庚白先生的劉景桂案感言一文，劈頭，對現在的中國社會，有如下的一段話。</p>
<p>「充滿了矛盾的意識，形態，的現代中國社會，在最近一兩年以來似乎更走進了歧路，一方面新的文化，還不曾建設起來而別一方面舊的，沒落的，文化，却漸漸抬起頭來，我們深切地認識，眼面前中國這一個階段，固然很需要努力於民族文化之復興，但復興民族文化，應有兩個基本條件，一是「反封建文化」的完成，一是「反帝國主義文化的樹立。同時要了解封建文化並不是我們民族文化的精神所托，而且牠正是摧殘了優美的民族文化之致命傷。……至於帝國主義文化的侵略，好像人人都很明瞭，可是這許多年的文化運動，不僅沒有把牠的勢力消滅了，倒反推動着牠的輪軸，這矯枉過正的病態，恰和迷戀封文化的錯覺，無形地對立。」</p>
<p>林先生作了這一分析後，於是提出了劉景桂案，認為是這新舊鬥爭過程中的產物，是一値得討論的社會問題。這個分析是對的，但林先生並沒明白指出這舊的，沒落的，文化，為什麽會漸漸在抬頭，帝國主義文化的侵略，為什麽依舊如故，不但依舊如故，據林先生的所見，正是「倒反推動着牠的輪軸」呢！因此對劉景桂殺人案的社會病態，似乎只有表面的說明，沒有觸着牠的根源，現在想替林先生加以補充，也許對這社會病態可更瞭然一點吧。</p>
<p>原來所謂「文化」，是社會上層的築物，而社會下層的基礎，却是經濟組織，中國固有的經濟組織，已經瓦解了，新的組織，在這內憂外患的夾攻下，尙未建立起來。在走頭無路的過程中，一部分人在戀古了，以為復古，也許有辦法。於是復古，成了新中國的新方案。過去的經濟組織，造成的是封建意識形態的社會，復古聲中，封建的經濟組織，固然不能再復活於現代的中國社會，而建封文化却可死灰複燃地來毒害現代的中國靑年。另一面，帝國主義者的侵略，却一天天在加劇，雖然眞携親善，高唱入雲，但有心人誰都會意味到其中的「心照不宣」。我們在經濟上，政治上都沒有辦法的現在，「反帝的文化」，怎能產生？郎能產生，那有明達如林先生者去愛護？所以「到反推著牠的輪軸」，正是必然且當然的現象了。</p>
<p>塡基的經濟組織崩潰了，當然不能產生更「優美的文化」，「所以現在的中國社會裏面只有十五六世紀的封建社會習慣的遺留」（借用林先生語）中國是半殖民地完全現代資本主義化當然不可能，「而十八九世紀的資本主義社會的意，識情緒的滋長」（再用林先生句）却是可會有的。在這個陳瘡未愈新毒又加的中國現社會中，產生出來的靑年是怎樣呢？逮明，劉景桂，就是最好的中層社會的代表者。個人主義的自私自利的人生觀，支配了他們的全意識，要飽一已的私愁，可不顧他人的利害。同時他們都是近視眼患者，看不見社會看不見世界，看不見前途，看不到眞正的仇敵，只知道個人的行所要為。尤其經濟寬裕的男靑年，利用社會優勢，追遂異性，朝秦暮楚，便是他的家常便飯。女靑年因封建的雰氣，尙包圍着她的周遭，封建的意識，尙根深蒂固地遺留在她的腦海，又沒有經濟實權在握的，所以雖憧憬着自由戀愛，然而終極，尙是當結婚是終身的養老院，將男子作終身的靠山，所以這養老院的將發生變故，與靠山的被奪，就是終身的大患，怎能不戰戰焉有所戒備呢？於是弱者的對情敵常謹塡以守，不勝則自殺，不能自殺的，則抑鬱以終，而强者（雖經一時之强，仍等於自殺，依舊是弱者。）則常取敵對進攻的行動，劉景桂的殺滕爽，就是例子。逯明的浪漫行為，玩弄女性，正是「十八九世紀的資本主義社會」的意識，情緒渲染他出來的，因為只有這種社會，才能結他有這樣的自由。劉景桂的因失戀而嫉妒，因嫉妒而同類相殘，是「十五六世的封建習慣」與「十八九世紀的英雄主義」，「一個人主義」養成她的。封建社會，女子羞被人棄，又無經濟實權，同時英雄主義，個人思想，使她只有已，與已的利害有衝突，殺之無捨。自己卽使犯罪，亦所不顧。劉景桂在這雙重毒物夾攻下，終於做了殺人犯。</p>
<p>所以劉景桂的殺人，逯明的玩弄女性，固然他們自己不能辭其咎，但這兩靑年，若不投生於這新舊毒素夾攻的現社會，他們决計不會如此，然而現在他們却做了社會的罪人。這惡氣迷漫的社會，將意志薄弱的靑年毒化，使他們做了社會的罪人，社會將他們和她們毒化。而墮落的靑年又助長了社會的紊亂。兩者便如此循環地演變着。</p>
<p>飽一人的私慾，洩個人的私慣，殺人自殺，長此以往，社會秩序，將更紊亂，且日益深化。</p>
<p>所以要使這社會復趨安寗，必需掃除這遺害社會的新舊毒素，要掃除這新舊舊素，誠如林庚白先生所說的，就需要「反封建文化的完成」與「反帝國主義文化」的樹立了。</p>
<p>婦女問題講座</p>
<h3>第二節原始時代的結婚及家族形態</h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>據歷史家的說明，自從人類脫離動物狀態以來到現在，約有二萬五千年，（歷史上所謂現代人的起源）但有紀錄可老的歷史，祇不過四五千年而已。這樣，人類是從久遠的往昔慢慢的進化為像今日一樣的文化人。在這長久的進化過程中，人類的經濟的，社會的，道穗的生活與及兩性關係，亦必適應人類自身的進化階段而有種種不同的形態，這正如現在的黑種人和白植人都各有不同的男女關係和生活形式一樣。</p>
<p>許多近視眼的布爾喬亞學者們，祇看到有史以來的兩性關係，便以為婦女的非獨立性和對男子的隸屬是歷史所决定的事情，過去旣如此，將來亦必如此，同時以為一夫一妻制的家族及結婚形式，是天然的不可變的東西。這種見解，不是有意的欺騙，便是無知的暴露</p>
<p>我們曉得，婦女在社會或家族中的地位是和經濟的發展階段有密接的關係，換言之，婦女在經濟的發展階段中所占地位，即其所負担的生產勞動的性質如何，是决定婦女在社會或家庭的地位。家族及結婚形式也同樣，是和經濟的發展階段有不可分離的關係。例如農業經濟階段和工業經濟階段家族及結婚形式，是完全不同的。</p>
<p>關於原始社會的男女關係，巴霍芬的研究是很有興趣的。在他的母權，（Droit-materna）一書中，詳述入類兩性關係的進化過程。茲舉其重要者如下：</p>
<p>（一）原始的人類，兩性關係為亂交</p>
<p>（二）這類性交，不容父性之確立，子女祇知有母而不知有父，因而發生母系制，即母權制。上古一切民族莫不由此起源</p>
<p>（三）這樣的結果，婦女與母性成為後嗣唯一確認之尊親。其享受尊敬之程度，照巴霍芬的想像，曾達到有母權統治權</p>
<p>（四）後來轉變到一夫一妻制，婦女專處於男子。（參照蔡和森著社會進化史）</p>
<p>巴霍芬以後，摩爾根在各地野蠻民族中搜集許多關於這方面的材料，遂證實了巴氏的研究的正確。並且他更把原始時代的家族及結婚形態加以系統的研究。他把原始的結婚及家族制度分為如下四種，而這四種形態，是和社會的經濟的發展階段正相適應，現在依據摩爾根的意見，對於每一形態加以簡單的說明，以便讀者參考。</p>
<p>（一）血族羣婚家族</p>
<p>人類最初是過羣的生活，和毒蛇猛獸或異族作羣體的生存競爭，他們都靠獲取自然物以維持共同生活，無論强者或弱者，男或女都祗有在這共同團體中才能生活，個體决無單獨生存的可能，而在這種情形之下，一面為着加强團結，一面為着繁殖種族，在血族羣中實行羣體結婚。即是兄弟姊妹自然成為一羣的夫婦。在這羣體中有一主母　她是這共同體中的主人。所謂母權氏族由此而起。</p>
<p>（二）半血族羣婚制家族　　人類進入於未開時代的初期生產工具相當的發達，發明種植　類，飼養家畜，這時代穀類及家畜的生產勞動是由婦女負担，男子是從事戰爭和狩獵。因此，婦女在經濟上占重要地位，這就是母系氏族發生的經濟基礎，這裏以母系為中心，故財產的承繼也只限於婦女，至其結婚形式，則因為他人類進入於未開時代的初期們經騐了血族羣婚在其種族繁殖上有害，遂以母系來分血統，而以不屬於同一母親的一羣兄弟和一羣姊妹作團體的結婚。所謂母權時代由此開始。</p>
<p>（三）對偶婚制家族</p>
<p>這是一時的一夫一妻制所形成的家族。人類到未開時代的中期及末期，農業及牧畜已相當的發達，母系氏族的經濟的生活甚豐富，而男子是不能承繼母親的遺產，故祇能加入妻系氏族團體才能生活，男子無經濟的支配權，祗為了妻系氏族而執行戰爭的任務。這時的結婚形式雖為一夫一妻的結合，但其離合很容易的。這就是母權的全盛時期。</p>
<p>（四）一夫多妻家族</p>
<p>這是母系制被顚覆，父系制成立後發生的家族形式。在這時代農業及畜牧業的技術發達，勞動的形式也跟着變化，需要多量的勞動力，因此男子們從戰爭中捕來的俘虜，不再殺死而把牠作為奴隸，使牠勞動，這樣，生產物更富裕起來，除了消費外還有剩餘的東西，從此，男子便利用指揮奴隸的經制的優越權以顚覆母權制度，確立父系制度。所謂父系氏族便由此發生，這氏族中的家長是男子，他們從戰爭中掠奪異族的婦女來做自己的妻妾，遂形成多妻制家族，所謂掠奪婚就是這時代的產物。</p>
<p>從此以後，不單婦女淪為男子的奴隸，跟着私有財產制度的發生，男子間也發生貧富貴賤等階級的差別。共同生產，共同消費的原始共同體也從此永遠為歷史上的陳迹了！</p>
<h3>滬西鄕村婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>滬西，越界築路的圈子外面，聚族而居的村莊，草棚，茅舍，棋子般的散佈着在縱橫交錯的菜畦裏。他們的主要生活是種地，做小生意，拉車子，進工廠出賣勞力。</p>
<p>婦女，除却和男子一樣負起生活的擔子外，還要加上燒灶火，洗衣服的勞作；帶領小孩，做鞋脚，補破衣，那是更不用說的份內事。</p>
<p>在這裏，一家生計的支撑，實際上，不是男人，却是婦女。每一對侶伴中，婦女總是佔着生產的重要角色。</p>
<p>種地的夫妻，大半日子男人是東進西出的白相着；佈　，鋤草，澆糞，多是女人的職務。讓大的孩子在垃圾堆裏滾，忍受着一切危險，讓戀着乳頭的嬰兒躺在家裏哭，她們留在田裏，腰兒灣痛了，挑滿一擔菜，才得回來；喘着氣：「唉，沙耿勒！」把頭巾丢在一邊，坐下來，哭　了的嬰孩依在懷裏，小傢伙牽牽扯扯，哭着肚子餓啦，氣還不曾透過來的媽媽，又得趕忙燒夜飯了。天還沒有完全亮，如果今天的田地不需要她們什麽勞作，挑菜上街賣，却又多是妻子的事情。——一般的，丈夫總比妻子要安閒。</p>
<p>做工的男人，洗衣燒飯有母親妻女給安排，如果是單身漢，廉價的飯館可以解决他吃飯的問題工。女呢，就沒得這般福享了！不但燒飯洗衣依仍是自己，有兒女的，撫育照料，怎樣也無法卸責；而且，在經濟上，領來的工資，並不能如男人有自由處理權，父母哥兄或翁姑丈夫對她們的限制兇得很哩，她們必將全部的收入交給家長：「那能好不交出來哩？人情往費，一家頭格吃喝，都是伊開消格呀！」要做件把衣裳還得向他們討，時常遭受不客氣的拒絕。早上絕早就起床，工廠路遠的得跑三五里，十二個鐘頭的勞動，加上跑和吃的躭擱，一天耗費十五六個鐘點的時間，却只能得到四五角頂多八九角的酬報；做夜班更吃力了，白天回來，兒啼女號，料理家務，很難偷個時間熟睡一覺。因此，這裏，姑娘們打情賣俏希圖撈點外水，婦人們把自己的嬰孩丢到母子永不能再見的育嬰堂去，都是十分平常不足驚怪的事。資本主義的繁榮，絞榨她們的血汗的，管家育兒兩重重擔之外，她們必須把勞動時間獻給工廠；不堪的負重磨折着她們，她們無論在工廠，在家庭，都是被當作一架活的機器在看待的呢。為兒女生計荷重的婦人們，為工頭拿摩溫所歡喜的少女們，又溫順，又熟練的，這裏的婦女，差不多都有着這資格的。</p>
<p>婦女的能力，在這裏，顯着驚人的活躍！但在地位上，並沒有因為她們的强幹，她們是家庭生計的支柱而改善什麽；男子仍然有無上的主人權威，一切交往和娛樂的享受多是男人，一切笨重和煩瑣的負祖多歸婦女。</p>
<p>春風吹嫩了千疇交錯的田野，農忙了，在綠油油的菜畦裏勞作的她們，太陽晒得臉子紅灼灼的，腰兒低低的俯着，敏捷的，輕快的，田坎上堆滿了丢棄的雜草，凝固的土地鋤得鬆鬆的了。一陣軟風戲弄着覆在頭上的巾帕，她們像羣蝶兒游戲在花叢一樣娟美；雄糾糾的野馬般的，忙碌的在田野上梭來梭去；給人一種健康的活潑的生存者之壯美的印象。</p>
<p>可是，一年不如一年的菜價低落，她們的辛勞就等於白費，難活下去的，多着呢。時常，她們喊出她們窒息般的痛苦：「活苦惱哩……」這種難堪的重壓，一天天廣泛而深入的，在迫害着圍繞這個繁盛都市的農民們。</p>
<p>她們能够領到學校學生們招洗的衣服時，一天用手洗七八十件是常事。</p>
<p>無論叫喊的買賣，推糞車，……種種只要是為社會所允許幹的勞動，婦女們都在不落後的勞動着的。</p>
<p>她們，滿蓄着創造人類幸福的精力，可是，一部分的活力被剝奪，「英雄無用武之地；」一部分為閒蕩的男人和家庭的負累而存在；喪家之犬般的，牛馬般的生存着。——永遠不能在人類的幸福中取得自己的幸福！</p>
<p>她們的强有力的生命精力，假使有充分的發展機會，移山倒海是件難事嗎？誰說她們翻不轉幾千年的婦女的從屬地位呢？</p>
<h3>姨太太日記</h3>
<p>— 露露</p>
<p>三月四日</p>
<p>昨天運氣眞壞，正要成那一牌，讓那瘟娼給打破了。這幾天接連地總是輸。</p>
<p>長總說他和她近來沒有關係，我何必跟他去用嘴辯呢！昨天那戒指是買來幹什麽的？給二小姐出嫁的，那眞騙人，二小姐明年秋天才出嫁，用得着這早買戒指！並且老太太也並不知道。</p>
<p>他又是天快要亮才回來。公事忙！吃花酒忙！連瘟娼都找不着他，不知又要玩什麽新花樣</p>
<p>三月六日</p>
<p>前天我誤解他了。據趙太太說的確那天他們是在揚子開股東會議，也沒有女的參加，只他們自己幾個打了幾圈麻將。並且他還贏了錢回來，怕是眞的。</p>
<p>昨天下午烟抽得太多了，並且他兩夜沒有好好地睡覺，要好好地睡，我便不得安身了！沒法子，正如他時常和我說的：「你要用起錢來我便不得安身」是一樣的。這也難怪，醫生本來是說我有病，所以對這個特別感覺厭倦一點。但是他如果去我那了瘟娼，我又確實是不快活。這怎麽辦呢？男人在女人身上花錢是為了什麼呢？我只好……！唉，媽說過：「有福的女人是要能使男人歡喜」。</p>
<p>三月七日</p>
<p>今天是二小姐媽的死紀，一淸早老太太就鬧着辦素席。那還有什麽鬧頭呢，再講究些人還是死的。×長天天在外面玩，她都不見管一管，總告訴人說姨太太是花錢買的，不値什麽。其實從前她對她那她婦還不是一樣的說法：「男人只要有錢，取女人總容易。現在又尊重起死人來調排活人了。要知道你自己也是女人呀！眞的，娶來的和買來的有什麽分別？用男人的錢陪男人睡覺總是一樣的事！</p>
<p>下午他回來得很早，而且一直都在我房裏。大概又在外面遇了什麽不快活的對頭，所以對我這樣好，還說明天要帶我上公司去買東西呢。可是為什麽忽然又說我太瘦了，趕不上顧遠如太太的胸部好看。我明知他是跟我開玩笑的，但是……。</p>
<p>三月八日</p>
<p>今天一淸早顧遠如太太就哭哭啼啼地跑得來，眞把我嚇壞了，還在做着夢就爬了起來。原來她又和顧老爺吵了架，要離婚。這到正和我們家裏的五太太差不多，一年起馬要離九次婚。但是離婚的狀子還沒有做，兩個人又抱起來，親做一團。果然，今早我剛洗了臉，還沒有把顧太太的眼淚勸乾，她老爺便來接了她回去。晚上聽說又是一輛汽車開到回力球塲去了。</p>
<p>後來聽說他們這次吵架的確是為了顧遠如要娶一個女人。我想如果是眞的話，我也要勸顧太太不要提出離婚兩個字來。在這樣的世界裏，男人要重娶，女的提出離婚那眞是太便宜人家了，你這障礙走了還不好麽？所以最好不走，寗可搬開去住，每天的開消是要男的照付。</p>
<p>我想明天下午一定到顧家去看看，到底是什麽一回事情。</p>
<p>三月十二日</p>
<p>這幾天讓顧家的專把頭都鬧暈了。我是無論如何不贊成顧太太離婚。連小姐這人眞奇怪，碰着這樣的塲合她總是勸女的離婚。總說是與其讓男人去調排不如不要這樣的男人，寗可窮苦一些，自己去單獨生活。</p>
<p>這話說得不錯呀，我時常被那些瘟娼氣很了的時候也會這樣想。並且我也當眞的走過。比方前年我和×長淘的那一次氣，妙師父多麽殷勤地勸我到她庵裏去，當我初去的時候，她是每天親自到廚房裏去弄素菜，把服侍她的那個小徒弟籠玉調來陪我。她說「還是出家好，結了塵緣總是煩惱的。何况，老實點說，不怕你太太生氣，你今年也將近三十啦，你們×長又向來是愛風流的，錢又多，說不定隨時隨刻會娶上一兩個。那時你的太太還是要被人搶去的，不是嗎？哦」？</p>
<p>她還對我說：「只要你能誠心信佛，自己手裏也還有這麼多，就在這庵裏安心地住下去，將來我死了，一切還不都是你的」。</p>
<p>我那時確實是把妙師父的話信以為眞了。那知搬進去住了還不上三個月，我的東西差不多當完了，××長的音信也沒有了，那時候不待妙師父發言，全庵的人連對我的稱呼都變了。後來不是×長聽了李秘書的勸解，良心發現了接我回去，我還不知是個什麽下塲呢：</p>
<p>三月十三日</p>
<p>昨天的日記沒有寫完，碰着連小姐來了。她一來就談起顧太太的事。並且，多麽嚇人呀，正是昨天下午我們看完了頭塲電影的時候，她呑服了烟膏，後來還是讓連小姐的嫂嫂顧三小姐先發現了！給王院長打了電話，說是嬸嬸服了毒，才由王院長發了病車，接進醫院去。</p>
<p>連小姐談起這事來還是主張離婚。我順便地把我前年進庵的那件事向她談起來。她說進庵的辦法本來不對，尼姑總是騙錢。那有眞心替人想川路呢。我說離婚這件事根本就不對，世上的人總是欺壓女人的，女人不靠男人那裏還有出路！連連小姐現在是沒有結婚，自己的父親又有這樣的勢力，一個能幹的女兒找事做誰還不來捧呢？假使將來結了婚，有了兒女，人事也變遷了，父親不像現在的話，拖了兒女去找誰呢？</p>
<p>連小姐聽了我說的話，不做聲了。我想着她近來一定在講着戀愛，不然為什麽感情常常會變化得那麽奇特呢？快活的時候話那麼多，夏鬱的時候一句話都不說。</p>
<p>三月二十一日</p>
<p>顧家的風潮不鬧了。昨天兩夫婦又手挽乎地出去買東西，晚上還來約我們上紅梅酒家去吃飯。紅梅酒家好像專門是開設了給太太老爺們和事的一樣，上次我們五太太夫婦吵架，結果也是被×長約到紅梅酒家去吃飯，和解。</p>
<p>兩夫婦吵架的時候女的主動總是不値得的，人家總說女人量狹愛吵，被錢一哄又好了。我柱後總想竭力避免吵架這一回事。（未完）</p>

<h3>「忙」的哲學</h3>
<p>— 黃瑩女士</p>
<p>人與猪玀不同：猪玀吃飽了食料，可以終日睡在欄裏，什麼事也不幹：但人却不能只是吃飯睡覺，不做事情。一個生活在時間與空間中的社.人，其精力乃是消費在空間的變化與時間的進展中的：由於空間的不斷變化，時間的不斷進展，人類的生活也在日益變化進展中，因而人的精力也是在日益消費中的。但這是沒有辦法的事情，時間前進了一秒一分，人類的精力就得隨之而消費一部份；因爲，只有在人類不斷消費其精力中，歷史才能因人類的推動而向前進展。所以，活的社會人，不能像死的靜物樣，死板板地佔據着一定的空間，白白地讓時間飛跑過去；他必然要活動，工作，做事情，一方面是消費其精力，消費其時間，同時，在另一方面也就是他在繼續生活，追求生的樂趣。假使一個常態的活人，每天吃了飯什麽事情也沒有，不知道怎樣消費自己的精力，只是呆着眼睛讓時間前進，那我相信他是非常痛苦，甚至無法生活下去的。我們看，那些脊錢的老爺太太，不是什麼正當事情都不能而且也不願意做的嗎？但正因爲他們沒有正當事情可做，便不得不拚命去幹那些無聊的勾當，如跳舞，賭博，追逐異性，玩狗玩貓等，借以消費其精力。倘若呌這些有錢因而有閒的老爺太太不去研究方程式（叉麻雀），不到回力球塲和跳舞廳，不養一條很通人性的狗，不追求性的刺激，你想想看，那他們的精力將消費到什麽地方去？他們的精神將會如何的痛苦？再看，在所謂小有產者之羣中，不是有許多先生被稱爲「無事忙」的人嗎？其實，正因爲他們無一定的事情可做，生活沒有中心，精神沒有寄托，所以才不得不每天跑馬路，找朋友，空吹牛皮，做出一種忙得要死的樣子。</p>
<p>是的，活的社會人與吃飽了食料什麽事情也不幹的猪　不同，他是必須要工作，活動，以消費其精力的。但是，人間的事情很多：做工，經商，敎書，寫文章，是工作，事情；賭博，跳舞，抽大烟，廣義說起來，也是工作，事情；革命或者去作漢奸，仍然可以說是說作，事情；……在這些事情中，何者是正當的呢？我們在自己的人生過程中究竟應該做些什麽事情呢？梁啓超先生在其有名的論文「人生目的何在？」中，責問了各種各樣的人爲何忙碌之後說：「忙是人生的本分，試觀中外古今大人物，若大禹，若墨子，若釋迦，若某督，乃至其他聖哲豪傑，那一個肯自己偸閑？那一個不是席不暇暖，突不得默，奔走棲皇，一生到老？若厭忙求閑，豈不成了衣架飯囊材料。至於說到厭世，這是沒志氣人所用的字典方有此兩字；古來聖哲，從未說過；千萬不要誤會了。我所說的，是告訴汝終日忙，終年忙，總須向着一個目的忙去。汝過去現在，到底忙個甚麽？所爲何來？不惟我不知道，恐怕連汝自己也不知道；汝自己不惟不知道，恐怕有生以來，未曾想過。嗚呼！人生無常，人身難得；數十寒暑，一彈指頃，便爾過去；今之少年，竹幾何時，忽巳碩然而壯，忽復頹然而老，忽遂奄然而死，囫圇模糊，蒙頭蓋面，包膿裏血，過此一生，豈不可憐！豈不可惜！何况這種無目的的生活，决定和那種種憂怖煩惱，糾纏不解：長夜漫漫，如何過得！我勸汝尋根究柢，還出一個題目來，便是呌汝黑暗中覓取光明，敎汝求一個安身立命的所在。」「忙是人生的本分」，但我們必須有目的的忙，不能隨便濫費精力；目的爲何？那便應該是在「黑暗中覓取光明」。——這眞不愧是先知先覺的言論！我們在生活過程中應該爲什麼而忙，應該做什麽事情的問題，在這段正確的言論中也有了明白的答案：那便是應該爲在「黑暗中覓取光明」而忙，做在「黑暗中覓取光明」的事情。</p>
<p>我們在上面已經表示過：歷史的前進，是要靠人類的推動力的。如果人類的不斷推動歷史前進，就是人類之日益由黑暗走近光明，那麽，所謂「在黑暗中覓取光明」的事情，具體說來，便是推動歷史前進的事情。因此我們可以這樣說：「忙是人生的本分」，人是必須要做事情的；而推動歷史前進，更是我們「忙」於做事的最高原則。在這一原則下，追求低級的娛樂的事情，當然是我們所不應該做的；跑馬路，吹牛皮，所謂「無事忙」的勾當，也是我們所當認爲無聊而與以鄙棄的；在我們的社會生活中，必須將自己的精力貢獻到推動歷史前進的社會運動中去，努力做有益於社會發展的工作。要這樣，才算是沒有亂費濫費白費我們的精力，才算是盡了我們的「人生的本分」。</p>
<p>當然，這樣說，並不是要一切靑年學生都離開學校，一切工人和店員都離開自己的工塲與商店，……去參加推動歷史前進的社會運動，不是；所謂推動歷史前進的社會運動，並不是在渺茫的太空中展開，而是在一般人羣中發生發展起來的。因此，人們的推動歷史前進的工作塲所，是在一般社會中，同時也就是在職業生活中。</p>
<p>歷史的前進，旣有賴於人類的推動力，所以個人對於人類社會的貢獻之大小，是與其所加於推動歷史前進的力之大小成正比例的。但一個人要具備偉大的推動歷史前進的力量，便須要有認識歷史前進的方向的才能，有知道推動歷史前進的力量如何的觀察力；同時，此種才能與觀察力又非來自天賦，而是在後天的生活中，經騐中形成的。所以，一個人要想增大他推動歷史前進的力量，便須常常到人羣中去考察一般實際的社會情形，常常閱看報章新聞及一般理論與實踐的書籍，借以豐富自己的知能，增加自己對於客觀世界的認識力。</p>

<h3>造表員</h3>
<p>— 倩蘋</p>
<p>在從前軍閥時代，我頓過的辦公室，嘴起來有一長串：什麽縣政府，稅務局，警察廳，然而我的工作老是那麽一套——「造表員」。這並不是我高興做這項工作，也非主官特別垂靑我，實在由於資格太淺，得不着閒一點的職務！</p>
<p>我所造的表，大都是關於經費方面的報銷。不管什麽性質的機關，總不外收支及公費差費幾項；看來很簡單，實地做去纔覺得麻煩極了。一方面鋼筆字要快要好，算盤也要熟習，如果字稍潦草，計數有點錯誤，那問題就大；在自己的主官發現，還不十分要緊，最多記過扣薪，若是被上峯批駁轉來，連主官也要受申斥。天下主官都是愛面子的，都是希望連陞幾級的，對於破壞他的「</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>官聲」「官運」的造表員，那眞不容易輕輕放過呵！本來關於經費的出納，員司的薪俸，所謂「四柱淸冊」的底子，是由會計處供給的，但是他們同主官非親便舊，對於自己分內的事，反要命令我們代做；這麽一來，身兼兩職，不但工作加重，而且還要帮負許多責任！</p>
<p>不管什麽機關，公費大都有個確切的規定，如果實支實報，那辦理表冊祇作一番記錄功夫就得了。不過，在從前軍閥時代，問題却並不這樣簡單，還有更隱秘的道理呵！公費雖有確切的規定，但是多用了算主官自己負責，少用是要繳還餘數的。主官不是傻瓜，當然不會多用少報，反過來說，就是祇有少用多報。所謂「多報」，便是恰合規定。</p>
<p>總之，實支數由主官盡量的節少，而報銷表則要由我們造表員弄得不剩一個。做這項取巧的工作，若僅僅由我們的腦筋幻想出幾個數目，適當的塡在表的支出項下，却也沒有多大的困難。不過上級機關對於證據是很講究的，卽是說，報銷表上有一枝筆，就要附呈筆舖的發票。天，我們往那兒去找這張發票呢？全份報銷數字都是揑造的，往那兒去找那麼多的蹬據？結果還是在我們造表員的腦子裏，開設了紙筆舖，米店，煤廠，……適當的取好商店的名字，跑到刻字鋪雕刻印記，再托人寫好發票，於是這工作纔算完成了。在表面上看來也許沒有難處，可是憑空揑造幾個商店的名字和貨物的價値，對於地方情形最少也要調查熟悉才不致發生破綻呵！</p>
<p>差費方面更覺困難：主官本來在家，也沒有派人出差，但是每月總要報銷幾十元幾百元的差費。譬如視察河工開支百元呀，調查命案開支五十元呀，……上峯也要確切的證據，而且住的什麽旅館，吃的什麽菜，都要一張詳細的單據。這麽一來，我們又要特別研究那個地方的地理：某鎭離某市多少遠，有幾家旅社，有一些什麽菜館。其他風土人情都需要一番考查。一切先决條件佈置後，我們造表員的身體雖坐在辦公室裏，思想却出差到幾十里幾百里外去了。這還不要緊，最使我感覺頭痛的，要算菜名的收集和價値的估定；因為每個月都有幾次差費報銷，每次出差總要假定三天五天。為了做假看不出來破綻，每餐菜名最好不要相同，每種菜還要適合地方環境。譬如回鍋肉是四川的普通菜，但不能塡寫在北方某機關的報銷上，大城市的西菜，不能出現在鄉鎭的小飯館裏，……。這麽一來，我們就是在辦公室外也得不着一刻閒空：一面要調查菜名，同時還要注意牠普通的價値。這種傻事，不能請敎當地的漂亮人，也不能問訉苦力（他們根本沒有進過餐館），大都跑到附近大小餐館，記錄菜牌或請敎廚夫。這項問題解决後，纔睡在床上過細的推敲：早上應該吃一盤紅燒肚條，夜間需要一壺花彫，兩碟凉菜。　二天，第三天，要另換一個花樣，……！</p>
<p>所以我在辦公室裏　的工作，表面上雖是造表，實地裏　還要當庶務，商人，廚夫，……。連白天解便都沒有得到過一次的痛快，夜間睡眠也不能上床就合眼。工作是這麽煩累，但是我的薪水最多不過二十四元；雖然帮別人賺了很多的錢，然而從沒有得到過一元兩元的津貼。——其實根本就沒有生過這種希望，祇要能够保持飯碗稍為久遠一點已算萬幸了。然而奇怪的是：連這個小小的心願都常常要成為一種幻想！</p>
<p>訓練與修養</p>
<h3>「用人」之道</h3>
<p>— 橫一</p>
<p>一樣的人才，經兩個人的雇傭，因為用法不同，所以成事的效果往往也就兩樣了。怎樣能使人靡然景從，使他服膺你的主張，專心戳力，甚至出死力，願苦幹，這是一個事業家應該研究的問題。</p>
<p>不過，人是活的東西，不冊如駕馭機械那樣容易。人的操縱，要「潛之於無形」，要「自然歸向」，孔明之於孟獲，七擒之，七縱之，無非是德的感化，所以我說只有不聰明的首領，才會捨本逐末，不從根本上使人臣服，而用「威脅」「利誘」的笨法，去硬生生地籠絡人。</p>
<p>經騐的事業家，大槪總能感到那般肯赴湯蹈火願效死命的人，决不是因為平時多給薪水的緣故。</p>
<p>一個事業家，能够用人，會用人，是他事業成就的初步，否則儘管你有多大的雄圖，只有拆柱子的人，沒有綠葉來襯托自己，那成敗利鈍，已早决之於當初了。茲進而論「怎樣用人」。</p>
<p>第一應該「深明人性。當用人之初，須先審察那人的人性如何。如果這人頗有可取之處，要想把他引為已用，則應處處給以信任的態度」。這卽所謂獨具隻眼是也。不能因為其人出身寒微，就抹殺他的優長。任何人都有他的高尙衝動，若能旣獲信任於前，自必奮勇發揮自己的能力，藉謀報效於將來。</p>
<p>所謂「信任」，决不是俗之所謂「放任」，所以善用人的，態度上是有信任的表示，然而暗中未嘗不可施以監察，或拘束。把信任和拘束連結在一起，在表面上看來，好像自相矛盾，其實在董率羣力的時候，確是並行不悖，而且有相得益彰之效。</p>
<p>第二，須賴人格感化。我常說人格感人之力最大，足以使人感泣，足以使人震懾。正如古人所謂：精誠所至，金石為開。</p>
<p>若問人格從什麽地方來的呢？簡單地說來，人格，源於人類的本性，人性凝聚而表現於形的，才成為一個人的人格。一個人的人格，决不可僅從一端去發現，也不可單執其品性之某一端，卽認為其全人格之表現。</p>
<p>理想的人格，第一應能自制的，情感能為理智所駕馭，才算能自制的人，世界是一個大刧塲，變幻莫測，若非非常之人，不能應非常之變，中山先生廣州蒙難，砲聲起於外，而從容如故，這種約束情威的自制力，表現於其人格者，足使他的黨徒敬佩其人格之偉大，而得多數人死心歸附。二，能不自私，三，能不刻忮，四，有和平的操守，五，有合作的情操，六，不嫉妬，七，有廉潔的榜樣，所以，所謂理想的人格實亦人之自然的威望（Naturalprestige）。</p>
<p>用人之道，故先應有領袖才。</p>
<p>科學業談</p>
<h3>宇宙大觀</h3>
<p>— 羅列</p>
<p>拿宇宙空間的全廣　來說，就是科學家也不能說出一個具體的究極來，只能說因為物質的存在是無限的，所以宇宙的廣袤也是無限的。雖然現代的科學已很進步，但就其所能窺測的宇宙空間，仍是很有限的，至多不過只知道宇宙最小之一角而已。但是，就是這現所僅知的有限空間之一隅罷，其偉大可驚的程度，談起來也會駭人一跳的！</p>
<p>當你站在不出一英里以外的地方，去看一個四五尺高大，的人，那麽那個人就會變成一個黑點，簡直不易讓你看上眼來。這話的意思是說：一英里的距離並不很短，它能使四五尺高大的人縮小成一個黑點，則它在我們的肉眼直接感覺中，也算相當的長大的距離了。但是，你若問地球有好大呢？那麽，單就它的直徑說，就有七千九百二十英里左右。至於它的周圍，若以每一，緯度的弧說，約為六十九英里，以三百六十度乘之，則地球周圍就有二萬四千八百英里上下那樣大。至於地球的質量，是六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇噸，就是說是六十萬萬萬萬萬噸。這樣，地球又可算是懸掛在天空的大泥球了。然而，就以太陽系的八大行星來說，地球的體積比木星要小一千三百倍，其直徑比木星小十一二倍，比土星小九倍多，比天王星小四倍多，比海王星約小五倍。至於地球比之太陽，那更是小得多了。太陽直徑有八十六萬六千四百英里，比地球約大一百零九倍多，它的體積約大於地球一百三十萬倍，其重量比地球重三十三萬二千倍，所以差不多要一百萬個以上的地球，才能做成一個太陽。</p>
<p>上面不過就太陽與行星的本體大小來說，若從太陽系所佔的空間來看，距太陽最近的水星也有三千六百萬英里，地球距太陽是九千三百萬英里，而海王星距太陽則有二十九萬七千一百六十萬英里。所以如果單就地球來說，以它距太陽的九千三百萬英里作半徑，以太陽為圓心畫一圓周（地球繞日軌道是橢圓，非正圓）則這圓周的直徑就有一萬八千五百萬英里。地球以每秒鐘行十八英里的公轉速度在這圓周上走個圈子，需要一年的時間，卽約需三千一百五十三萬六千秒。如此則此圓周約有五萬六千七百六十四萬多英里了。再以更遠的海王星來說，它以太陽為中心所劃的軌道，單是說到直徑就有五十九萬四千三百二十萬英里，則太陽系所佔的空間之大可以想見的了。在這空間中，以光每秒鐘行十八萬英里的速度計算，由太陽射到地球是要八分多鐘，再射到海王屋就要四點三十六分多鐘。假使從地球的軌道一端射到他端，那是要十六七分鐘才能達到的，而從海王星的軌道一端射至他端，則需要九點多鐘頭。若以每小時行四十二英里的火車由地球向太陽駛去，要二百五十四年多才能達到太陽：再向地球軌道的對極駛去，就要五百多年才能達到。在海王星上放一最大速度的砲彈，當它達到太陽中心時，已是二百五十年；當它再達到海王星自己的軌道的對極點時，則已是五百年的時光了。</p>
<p>太陽和太陽系就算大了嗎？不然，不然，太陽比之地球是巨人，若以它比之別的巨星則變成侏儒。太陽系所佔的空間比別的屋團和星雲座，那又是渺乎其小了。把太陽的大算作一個單位，則天琴座的Ａ星要比它大二又小數點四倍；天蝎座的Ｙ星比它大三又小數點二倍；半人馬座的Ｂ星比它大十一倍；御夫座的Ａ星比它大十二倍；牧夫座的Ａ星比它大三十倍；金牛座的Ａ星比它大六十倍；飛馬座的Ｂ星比它大一百七十倍；獵戶座的Ａ星比它大二百九十倍；海怪座的〇星比它大三百倍；武仙座的Ａ星比它大四百倍；天蝎座的Ａ星比它大四百八十倍；獵戶座的兩個肩星中之一個最亮的變光星要有五千倍太陽的體積才能造成它那樣大。至於直徑在一百萬英里以上的星，其數是有好些的，變光星直徑竟大到三萬萬英里，地球繞日的軌道都幾乎可以包括在它的圓周裏面。</p>
<p>天空中的星球，天文學家將其劃分成區域來研究，每一區域以一主星命名卽為一星座，就現時已公認的有六十八個星座之多，當然還在繼續發現中。每一星座所包含的恒星，為數也是很多的，由幾千幾萬到叶萬百萬不等，據說山女星座的螺旋星雲所包含的有幾百萬乃至幾十萬萬顆星球。在天體中計算各個星團，星雲及其距離的空間面積，已不能適用英里為單位，要用光年了。所謂光年卽光以每秒行十八萬五千英里的速度前行一年之久的距離，作為一光年的距離。我們前面說過，太陽系的面積直徑，若光在其間進行不過需時九月，但在太陽系以外與地球最近的半人馬星座的第一星，距地亦有二十五兆兆英里，需四，四光年才能到地球，天狼星距地有五十兆兆英里，卽約有九光年的距離。有些距我們很遠的螺旋雲星，是有一千萬光年的距離的，因為它距離我們的地球竟有六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇英里那樣的遠。不僅如此，天空中還有更遠的物體，是一萬萬年前它的光就發出來了的，到如今才到天文學家眼裏來。這就是說，現在天文學上已能窺見一萬萬光年的空間距離了。</p>
<p>在天空中的恒星有許多是自成一太陽系，它們居住最密的地方在天空中映成天河，這天河的面積就有五萬光年那樣大　直徑，有三四千光年那樣大的厚度。天河之邊最遠處的一個星的　星光射到地球上來，就要經過五萬年。像前述的螺旋星雲，其直經亦有五萬光年，不過是島的宇宙中之一最顯著的星雲而已，其實在現在所見的宇宙中，星雲之數，至少在十萬以上。至於宇宙中的恒星，　見今科學界的估計，亦至少在三十</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>萬萬個左右。從這樣看來，這已發現的一萬萬光年的宇宙中，羅列着三十萬萬個左右的恒星，而恒星密集的島的宇宙，已有大到五萬光年的領域的，此外還有那更遠的稀薄的天空，尙未為近今科學技術所探索到，則如此偉大，如此燦爛的宇宙之海，人在這中間比起牠們來，恐怕還小及一個電子與皮球之比罷，這是多麽驚人的啊！</p>
<p>藝壇</p>
<h3>藝術的客觀性</h3>
<p>— 蔭潭</p>
<p>我在最近讀了一木科學的著作，牠會論到藝術和科學的區別，說科學是客觀的，藝術則是主觀的。牠所持的理由很簡單，因科學是以說明客觀事實和規律為本質，是以公衆所共認和具有普遍的贊同性為基礎，不依個人的主觀感情與意見而異其趣；而且事實與規律也不能由個人主觀加以選擇和剪裁，所以是客觀性的。藝術則不然，藝術是在宣洩作者個人的感情，個人的感情不但因人而異，而且是隨時變化的。至於藝術雖然也以客觀事物為描寫的對象，但這是藝術家自已的任意取捨，隨自己的觀戚立塲不同，而自由加以配合剪裁的。作者個人自已固然以自己所認為美的觀點去組織它，就是觀者亦以自己的美的觀點和感情云判別它，所以作者不能只一點一滴地盡數描寫客觀事實，便能構成藝術品，觀者亦要自己以為它美才能覺得它美。這些都是主觀的。</p>
<p>這樣的藝術認識觀點，不但是觀念論的，而且就是對於藝術本身的理解，也是太皮毛而不深刻的議論。是的，任何一種人工的產物，如果從不能離開人自身的努力，不能離開頭腦的思維這一點來說，都帶有幾分主觀性的色彩在，特別是一切智慧的產物。但是，這種主觀客觀的交互作用，只有從精神生產之活的的最近一環看來，才有並立的形式，如果迫進一層，要問這兩種對立物的最後根源，那麽客觀的事實始終是自存於客觀世界之中，而主觀的思維的生起，最初亦仍川於客觀，如此，則能够獨立自足的主觀是沒有的。如果我們能够這樣去理解思維與現實的關係，那麼以藝術是主觀的，科學才是客觀的這種說法，便是不正確的，嶉有說藝術科學同是客觀的，才說切合事實與眞理。</p>
<p>比如說科學是在說明客觀的事實和規律，那麼藝術又何嘗不是以客觀現實為依據的！一切偉大的藝術作品，都要冊體現客觀的深刻的背景，才能成其為藝術並表現出它的偉大，也才能抓住觀衆的心理，打動他們的感情。凡沒有現實的意義的作品亦皆沒有這種作用。那些觀念論的藝術家和批判家，以為一種藝術作品，因為它是為常人所不曾觀感到的東西，愈能引起觀衆的興趣與驚奇時，便愈是作者個人的精神感動了人。其實這種最能動人的藝術作品必仍是最能描寫現實的裏面的東西。換句話說，卽因為它或者是能從普通人所不注意的庸俗事實中，烘托出事實本身的特殊意義來，或者是比普通人更看到了現實的某些精華的緣故。但是，所謂有特殊意義和某些精華的事實，總不能離開現實而存在，偉大的藝術家以能超乎常人的手腕，去掘出這些背面的東西，用以抓住觀衆的觀威，這正是最能描繪現實之所在。自然，這裏亦常因有不同的社會，遂有體現不同的現實的作品，和有對於那些作品發生不同的觀威的觀衆出現，因而不能獲得普遍的擁護。但要成一種偉大的和受人歡迎的作品，至少總得體現自己所屬的社會的生活之現實性，才有可能。這樣看來，藝術也和科學」樣是要以現實為基礎的。</p>
<p>其次，說到科學對於事實無須剪裁配合，而藝術則要由作家出以心匠，加以材料的剪裁配合，也是不正確的。科學的研究中對於事實也有剪裁配合。因為當我們研究科學製定規律時，一定要把許多雜亂的現象加以比較配合，排除一些無關本題的外　現象，審度出那些是形似而實非，或那些是外裏雖異而實剪裁配合是甚麼？至於藝術作品的剪裁和配合，也不是完全出於作者的自由意志，他一樣要依客觀規律來進行他的工作才能成功。這種客觀規律就是自然和社會的法則。比如一個盡家，在他的一幅畫的各種配合中塡顏色時，就得照他那幅盡上的自然現實景致去配合，他總不能在一束鮮花上亂塗一堆墨，因為這樣是不合於自然之美的。又如一部小說和電影，它不能描　一個乞丐穿起西裝革履，坐起汽車去討飯，因為這也是不合社會生活的規律的。如此，則我們可以明白地看出藝術家的工作與意匠，是和科學家一樣的，都要對於材料有所選擇，並且要依照客觀規律去選擇配合原料，去進行他的組織和描繪工作。</p>
<p>不錯，藝術是在宣　作者個人的感情，然而作者個人的感情只有觀念論者才認為它是個人的先天的，自足的，和客觀無關的。其實，個人的感覺是社會所反映和培養成的，愈是偉大的藝術家，他的感情愈是體現着社會的感情。社會要有威迫也才有憤怒和反抗的感情，作者的感情要愈能代表這種感情，也才愈能成為宣洩作者個人和社會的感情之有力的作品。社會的上層要有愉快安閑的生活，有喜幸的感情，作者也才能作出代表某些生活的喜劇作品出來。不能體現社會感情的瘋子，他雖毫無忌憚地在發洩他的威情，但不能作為任何藝術活動的內容。不但偉大的作品其所發洩的個人威情要是客觀的社會的，就是觀衆的感情也是社會的。完全和他們的社會的公衆生活與社會心理無關的作品，是不能抓住他們的感情，他們也不能發洩出同樣的感情來適應這種作品，贊賞和歡迎這種作品。總之，偉大的藝術是現實的客觀的反映，和科學一樣。科學的藝術不能離開現實，不能不體現現實。藝術也是科學，愈能體現現實，依科學方法去組織，研究藝術，便愈是科學的藝術。</p>
<h3>上海劇院樂據訓練所巡禮</h3>
<p>— 李梅</p>
<p>由於自己向來愛好戲劇，在往日，祗要有一張較佳的影片，那無論如何是逃不了我的眼睛的。尤其對於話劇，我是有着一種說不出的情感；不管怎樣的一個劇團公演，我總是懷着熟烈的心情去瞻仰</p>
<p>五四以來，我國文化運動的史實，是有着可紀念的成績的，特別是話劇和文藝創作，更其在那兒長足的進展着，雖然一般藝術是同樣地也在進化。</p>
<p>但，為了時間和人材的限制，單祗戲劇一方面，就沒有能够充分地發展。在歐洲盛行而且很是普遍的樂劇（Opera），直到現在，仍然不常見於我們的劇壇。人們只是以盼望的目光在期待着牠。</p>
<p>近來的新聞紙上，不斷地登載着關於上海劇院樂劇訓練所的消息。到今兒為止，他們差不多已經上了一週的課了。</p>
<p>這一個嶄新的事物的出現，首先便引起我的注意和好奇；而當我知道了投考者數百僅僅錄取了二十個人之後，是更勾起我前往參觀的興緻。</p>
<p>是在一天上午，我呌了一輛膠輪車，欣欣然的到這訓練所來了。剛走進去，他們正在上課，由他們的所長陳大悲先生出來接待。在陳先生股戁的接待裏，我是作了個小小的巡禮。他們的訓練所給予我的印象是很深刻的。</p>
<p>二十個健美的孩子</p>
<p>當我初到訓練所時，從窗外我就瞧見了他們的課室。二十個人，女的在前，男的在後，極度嚴肅極度整齊的，安坐在自己的位子上；靜靜地，聽着導師的講課。那麼靜默，沒有一個人咳一聲兒嗽或說一句閒話。我個人，曾經過了十年以上的學校生活，從沒有見過這樣好的秩序。那麽有精神，更是難得。我深信，這些可愛的孩子們一個個都是十分健康的。在我的預期中，這個訓練所定是和普通的劇團一樣富有浪漫氣味的，然而事實却證實了我的推測完全是謬誤了。</p>
<p>他們的設備</p>
<p>那是一座不算小的洋房，位置在法租界陶爾斐斯路，法國公園的斜對面。你一進門，主要的，你便知道那裏是安靜和淸潔。他們不特不類似什麽劇團，甚至超過了最好的學校——在淸潔及秩序上。此外，設備方面，這個訓練所雖創立未久，倒是並不簡陋的。裏面有小圖書館，他們曾費盡了苦心，蒐集了所有世界名劇作的中譯本，像原理，思潮，史實一類的東西，也很不少。關於音樂，舞蹈，表情全有着最新式的設備和裝置？</p>
<p>超過了原來的計劃和理想</p>
<p>最初，他們是計劃着錄取一批中學程度的學生，用漸進的方法，貫輸給他們一些樂劇的智識和技能。錄取的結果，却盡是受過高等敎育的，因之，他們不得不加高原有的計劃。這一來，更增長了敎導者的志趣，他們是帶着勁兒講述着，希望學生們接受學問就如同接受注射。經自己仔細的探聽，纔明白他們的每位敎授，全是有着專門技能而且富有經騐的人材，特別是吳曉邦先生，我偸看他敎舞術的時侯在桌上跳上跳下，簡直像孫悟空大鬧天宮一樣。</p>
<p>生活在緊張而且堅苦的樂園</p>
<p>這是從一個學生的口中得來的。他說：「我們到這兒來，全是下了决心的。我們願意將小我的生命和靈魂獻給劇運的事業。我們現在是很堅苦的，也許日後更要堅苦吧？但我們飴終是以最大的决心來克服這種種的困難。我們功課將近二十種，每天得受八小時課，我們沒有多少休息及娛樂的時間：因為我們休息時大家全在作功課了，娛樂幾乎成了我們的工作，工作也就是我們惟一的娛樂。我們的腿骨鎭天價酸痛，不到禮拜天不能出外，但這一切並不使我們威到拘束。我們敢自信：至少在心裏，我們的同學是已將劇運的重擔放在自己肩頭上了。……」</p>
<p>我的和我們的希望</p>
<p>巡禮的結果是出我意料之外的滿意。眞想不到，劇團中居然有這樣的一個典範。浪漫，懶怠，爭吵這一些惡習，在這個訓練所裏是絕對沒有的；牠所有的是普通劇團的特長：堅忍，努力，全體一致。而且，那二十個孩子，康健活潑而且勇敢忠實。設備是那樣地充實：敎授們又是非常熟心的；在這樣的情形底下，我們是在預祝着牠未來的成功。</p>
<p>這兒，我們默默祈禱着樂劇運動的成功！</p>

<h3>捕魚之夜</h3>
<p>— 有仁</p>
<p>我愛鄉村，尤愛過鄉村生活；因為那裏有敎人難忘的山之巔，水之涯，靑靑的松林，靜靜的田野，處處可以使我怡然自樂。卽使農友們底那「太陽出來，我們出去工作；太陽落去，我們回來休息」的簡單而粗壯的歌調，在我也覺得比城市底無綫電台所播的什麽「小寳寳，睡着了」來得美妙；卽使我永遠的在鄉村過着生活，也不會像在城市樣地說句討厭，無聊。鄉村的生活，處處使我舒適；尤其是捕魚，是我生性底怪癖，每次的捕魚，總是使我留連忘返的呢。</p>
<p>是一個秋日底傍晚，雨初霽，我和表兄站在高的土隄上，正在欣賞着變幻不定的白雲和潔玉般的明月；這時，牧童雨後歸家的歌聲和着遠處送來的幾曲漁唱，淸脆地，曼妙地，響澈在大自然底宇宙裏，更使我感到無上的美感。我底心靈，像禁不住歌聲的引誘，同樣的唱着漁歌。我想捕魚去了，於是死釘着表兄，要他離了高隄回家：表兄禁不住我的纏繞，只好允許了我。我眞快樂極了！於是我們回了家，很快的收拾了捕魚的工具——魚簍，魚瓢及蓑衣　帽；待表兄疊好了網，我們便同往捕魚。</p>
<p>大地是沉靜的。農友們為了下雨，有的已走入夢鄉休息去了；有的為雨所阻，尙未歸家。草棚下的老牛，在深深地嘆着氣；家門前的小犬，時時在發出兩三聲「旺旺」的狂吠。路上很少行人，——幾乎沒有了人——走了許多路，才碰着鄰右的劉二荷着農具歸家。</p>
<p>再向前走，便模糊地望見了小石在驅着兩隻肥大的黃牛——牠們在拉着「槖車」急忙忙的回家。路是泥濘的，車在吱吱地發着響。牛兒喘着氣，小石還在呵斥着牠們呢！一聲鞭響，把大地上的空氣，由寂靜而激動起來了。</p>
<p>我們和小石相遇了，水泥由車下四濺着。</p>
<p>「才回家麼？」大熱套子又從我底口中發出來。</p>
<p>「是的，為了雨，二畝地的工作都沒有做完呢！」接着又說；「現在是秋天了，河水是新落的，又往那裏捕魚去？眞是沒事做了！也不怕被凉水浸成病麽？一同回家吧！」他看着我倆帶的傢伙，就料到我們是往捕魚；同時又關心到秋雨新落，夜水更凉，像怕我們被雨水浸成病般地，而來阻止。但我和表兄仍然前進着。走着，走着，轉了幾個灣，我們便在一處產荻叢旁的小橋上停下來了。表兄在橋下放下了網，不聲不響的站着。我舖好了蓑衣，偃臥在蓑衣上。靜靜地，像期待着什似的。</p>
<p>橋旁的蘆荻，在夜風中搖曳着。附近的高粱楷和黃豆棵長得深深地，雖有明亮的月光照着，却仍覺得有些陰森森地。田中的蛙鼓在雨後敲得格外起勁。這時的我，享受着眼前的美景，像忘了一切。驀抬頭，看看表兄，仍呆呆地持着網竿靜立着。漣　的水被月光照着，水裏的月也顯明地現出頭動的樣子。我剛吟出「水天雙月明高下」的詩句。表兄連忙說：「不要唱，魚兒嚇跑了！」這時，我底全付精神轉向表兄手中的網。網抬起了，水像銀練般地從網中滑下，水面的波紋一圈連一圈地向外發展，在月光中看來，像是有萬條小白金龍在碧色的玻璃瓶中游泳呢！待水滴完了，網中却是空空地！我有些疑惑，怎麽網中沒有魚呢？忽又想：也許是剛來到吧？頓時心中又恢復了以前的鎭定。網，一網一網地抬起，却述魚兒底影子也沒見！</p>
<p>「新雨後沒有魚麽？」我問表兄。</p>
<p>「有的，等一等。」表兄却毫不着急！又將魚網放入水中了。大地更沈靜了，風從附近傳來兩三個漁人底夜語。</p>
<p>「呀！別人也在捕魚呢！或許魚兒被他們捕完了？」我又向表兄發問。</p>
<p>「不會的，「魚過千條網」，……將烟袋給我吸袋烟呢！」表兄一面答我，一面要我遞烟袋給他。我以為吃烟可以捉到魚呢，慌忙地裝好烟，遞到表兄底手中。網又舉起了，但仍「空空如也」！夜風一陣陣地加大，身上因為穿的衣單，覺得戰慄了；但因自己拼命的要來，也只好暗自忍受。我傴僂着，一動不動的呆呆地望着網。眼睛為了好久看不到魚，有時又無意識的溜到遠處的夜景。</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>終於遠處的一切，也漸漸地模糊了。月快落了呀！我正在發急，忽然，表兄說：「遠處有魚來了，你聽河邊魚尾在響。」表兄拉回了我痴望的眼，轉向網中了。果然，我聽見水中咕嘍咕嘍地在響，魚網也起了大大的顫動，接着，魚捉到了！「快！」是表兄急促的聲音。這時，我慌了，也忘了冷，疾忙的拿了魚簍，衣服也沒有脫，撲通的跳下了河去。</p>
<p>「我說不要急呢，「十年不發市，發市吃十年，」你看這魚，有五斤多重呢！」表兄得意的呌着。看他那手中拿着的大魚，魚鱗被月光照得亮晶晶地，我心中有說不出的快樂，我只是笑着。我也不爬上橋了，老是站在網祇旁邊。此後是，網，一網一網地舉起，大魚，小魚，鯉魚，鯽魚，……接二連三的捉了半簍。</p>
<p>不一會，月姐走下山了，村裏傳來兩三鷄鳴聲。橋洞底黑影漸淡，蘆荻叢是顯得更黑暗了。「回去吧，看不淸了。」表兄像疲乏了，催着我回去，於是我們便離了蘆荻叢。啊！魚簍眞重，我沒有剛才來時走得快啦！魚，大的，小的，在網中亂跳着，簍在背上，一些也措不安穩，好容易才摸索着回家了。</p>
<p>可是，第二天，那些跳躍着的魚兒呵，已經挺挺地燒死在鍋裏了！你可憐的魚兒喲！人們底歡笑便是建築在你們底死亡上的呀！這時，我忽然想到了我們底目前的中國，我們底目前的中國便像死亡綫上的魚呀！</p>

<h3>沒落（一）</h3>
<p>— 沈千里</p>
<p>從上海到我的家鄉，祇要一天的時間就可以到達；有火車輪船可坐，路上並不戚到寂寞，這在交通的方便上，的確是値得我感謝的。我到家這天，正是鄕俗忙於「送灶」的晚上。若是在五年前的今天，全村充滿了的都是狂歡的情緒。可是，這天映在我的眼底的，祇是死寂的村莊；每一間土磚牆的門前，都顯示出一團靜恬凄凉的景象。</p>
<p>凜冽的北風，推着地上的落葉在稻塲的空地上打着盤旋，起着水瀉似的沙沙的音響；我和挑夫靜寂地走着，聽到樹葉的那種饗聲，不覺想到這是鄕村的一種沒落的預兆！</p>
<p>從碼頭上到家裏，是有着三里的路程，我同挑夫就在這夜色蒼茫中走着；中間經過了十多處村莊，每個村莊都現着貧血症似的頹敗。最後，這才的踏上了我們的村莊的邊緣；五年不見的我成長在這裏的村莊，這時所給予我見到的一切，也祇有更份外的衰老了！</p>
<p>整個的村莊沉浸在黑暗夜色中，一時竟使我無從找着自己的家門：我同挑夫摸索着在村裏繞了一圈，藉着一根一根的燃着火柴的力量，才算認淸了我家門口放着有一塊繫牛的石頭的大門了！</p>
<p>幾小時的奔波，使我减少了和家要人見面時說話的氣力！</p>
<p>「少爺！少爺！怎麽這早晚才回來？」長工阿福開了門，突然看見我這張幾年不見的生疏的面孔，一時倒不敢相信我會在這時回來；他借着屋裏放射出來的燈光，睜着眼在我臉上仔細地盤旋了一會，這才喊着幾年前對我喊的稱呼。</p>
<p>「唔！替我招呼把東西拿進來，阿福！」極度的疲乏使我對阿福興奮的神情，祇冷冷地敷衍了一下。</p>
<p>「少爺！你先到裏面去吧。這些東西我來搬好了。」他還是那麽熱情的招待着。</p>
<p>「好，不忙；他們都在後面麽？」阿福的熱情的感動，使我明白這時是不由我不喜歡說話的環境。</p>
<p>阿福把東西一樣一樣地搬進了堂屋，連大氣也沒噓一下就搶着打我前頭奔往後面去了，嘴裏還不住地在急促的嚷着：「少爺回來了！少爺回來了！」</p>
<p>我聽到阿福那樣熱情奔放的喊聲，心裏不覺暗暗地戚到一陣慚愧！</p>
<p>家人都給阿福的喊聲引了出來；「祖堂」的門口黑壓壓地擠滿了男的女的許多陰鬱的面孔，但當我們的視綫接觸時各人臉上却都堆下了一種無從說出的笑意。我看着家人這樣熱烈歡迎的情緒，一時竟想不起一句動聽的話語來給予他們一些慰藉！</p>
<p>「祖堂」裏顯着冷淸淸地尋常的樣子，過年時應擺的東西這時還一樣都沒有擺上，堂中間當空掛着的「保險燈」上結着厚厚的塵網，隨着風在空中蕩着；我剛跨進「祖堂」就給這許多不順眼的情景楞住了一會，五年前熱鬧的景象不覺又爬上了我的心頭。</p>
<p>家人們看到我這怪異的舉動，大家都祇是茫然地在我面前站着，誰都像沒有想到對這闊別了五年的生疏的人應該有什麽探問；我囘頭對他們望了一眼，這才發現在這一堆人叢中是少了一個我家的主腦人物。</p>
<p>「爸爸到那兒去了？今天怎麽還不能登在家，姆媽？」我走到母親身傍，撫着她的肩兒問着：祇見她那頭上烏黑的頭髮？也隨着疾駛的時間變成了蒼白的顏色了。</p>
<p>「到鎭去的，大概也快回了吧？你不是還沒吃飯？坤兒！」她勉强地在臉上露出一點歡笑，手頻頻地在我臉上摸着，態度顯得那末的不自然。</p>
<p>我問着這話，他們都突地吃了一嚇似的，沮喪地相互交換了一下視綫；可是一瞬間又都把視綫集中到母親的臉上，大家都睜着灰暗的眼睛本然的站着，似乎都感到將有一種禍事就要在母親這一啟唇之間降臨的惶恐。</p>
<p>「今晚上不是要「送灶」嗎？爸爸還到鎭上去幹什麽？」</p>
<p>從許多人臉上的表情看來，我猜想到父親的到鎭上去，决不是像母親口裏所說的那麽簡單。</p>
<p>「是的，是到鎭上貿「送灶」的東西去的。坤兒！你先吃飯罷，爸爸一會兒也快回來了。」母親朝他們瞥了一眼，接着喊：「阿福—你去關照三嬸子弄飯給少爺吃呀！」</p>
<p>母親額上的皺紋像船上摺攏了的篷布似的厚厚地堆着，一個疑慮的思潮又在那深厚的皺紋上游移起來；可是她還在那麽佯作鎮靜地朝我看着，似乎想在我這給流浪生活帶走了兒時的豐潤的臉上找得一點她所需要的安慰。</p>

<h3>梅琪伊文絲自嫌表演能力太廣泛</h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>依據着現在的明星制度而言，個人的成功大半是由於他的個性的發揮上的。他的個性的發揮，現在銀幕上的，就是普通所稱謂的作風。一個影星的作風，旣經自成一家，為觀衆所認識之後，往往就很難加以更變。因此，除了許多旣成名的明星，他們已經由他們獨特的作風，而享受着獨特的地位之外，許多將成名而未成名的演員，却最怕被列人某種作風，或某種派別。這大概是因為旣經類別之後，工作的機會就少，而成功的途徑亦狹窄了。</p>
<p>這是一般普通電影演員的感想。他們不願意被放入狹窄的類別之中。他們願意人家稱他們一聲做作廣泛的天才演員。他們喜歡聽見人家稱讚他們是Versatile的演員。但是為電影界的從業員的探討起見，我們却要提出一位被人稱為的Verstile女演員，她却被她的Veritility所害，而至今做著次等的角色。</p>
<p>梅琪尹文絲（Madge　Evane）亦是一位很有名的明星。她有柔軟的黃髮，微帶金色，淡藍色的眼睛，姿態極為秀麗。她是一位無所不能的Verstile演員。她在巳經四年之中，曾演過三十四張片子，最近又在「塊肉餘生」中飾著愛尼司的重要角色，也可以算是能者多勞了。但是她卻還是一位次要的演員，雖然是次要中的佼佼者。</p>
<p>為什麽？據她自己所發現的，就是因為她表演的範圍太廣泛了，太容易扮演任何角色了，因此她至今還沒有被攝製影片的當局，以及觀衆，認出她究竟是屬於那一類別的人。她却厭惡她自己的Verstility，而情願成功一種獨特的作風，而顯露她的專長了。</p>
<p>梅琪說：「一個女演員，普通是受種種限制，而成為某一種的作風的。但是等到某一種作風需要某一個演員的時候，她立即被選擇了。結果她所得到的，就是認識和成功。即如嘉寳她受了她那體格（方肩），面容（高顴），以及聲音（粗而發沙）的限制，而成了一種異國情調的作風，適宜於表演神秘及誘惑性的女郞。她在這一類別中，佔了第一把交椅，沒有人能和競爭的了。</p>
<p>「其餘的亦都如此。瓊支勞馥，凱茀蘭茜斯，安哈婷，康絲登裴湼，梅維絲，她們各有各人的個性，特長，作風，和類別，而各不相混，無論在製作家或觀衆的眼光中，她們都自成一家，永遠如斯。所以，到了最重要的角色分色的時候，她們的適宜，和能力，早已為導演們所承認，而自然地將重要角色派給了她們。</p>
<p>「但是我呢？剩餘下來的不顯著，無意味的角色，就將我的名字寫下去了。他們知道我是無所不能，無所不像的。所以無論是足球片中體育敎員的女兒，或是社會片中的英國貴婦，或是紐約的女企業家，或是中國的女看護，他們缺少適當演員的時候，就是我表演的機會。我現在做着隨便的角色，已經做得很久了。要使我自己不過於失望的話，我情願打破這種環境，而在某一種作風上被人們所認識；」</p>
<p>這種表演能力的廣泛，起初是可喜的資財，但是以後却漸漸使她厭倦了。不過像梅琪伊文絲那樣的天才，大概不至於使她終於失望的吧。</p>
<h3>評「逃亡」—金城</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在正人君子們慨嘆着民氣消沉的今日，這正面的以反帝抗日的姿態而出現的「逃亡」，就在這時候開映，這對於深陷於國破家亡的廣大的觀衆們，似乎是一杯苦酒。這苦酒使人們痛哭流淚，同時也使人們熱血沸騰的怒吼起來。</p>
<p>看罷，這一影片是這樣寫着的：在貧苦而也和平的塞北地方，帝國主義者的飛機，殘酷的轟炸了他們的家鄕他們的父母子女在血洗之下犧牲了，於是未死者扶老携幼的逃亡。在廣大無限的沙漠裏，在飢渴與風沙中，他們掙扎在死亡綫上。逃亡罷，痛苦呼號的逃亡罷，然而何處是他們的家鄉？何處是他們的歸宿呢？他們死於帝國”義的炸彈之下，同時也死於飢渴疾病之下。但是有錢的少爺們却乘機拐帶無家可歸的少女，同時也有些唯利是圖的奸詐之徒，為了販賣人口而將貪病的老頭兒掩埋於沙漠之中，而少女輾轉的被欔在色鬼淫棍的少爺之手。同時在另一方面却有所謂大腹賈的慈善家們，他們在收容災民的美名之下，從中漁利，只顧自己侵呑捐欵的肆意享樂，而難民們所得到的是吃不飽的稀粥，睡在汚穢的硬屋子裏，使少爺們嗅到了難聞的臭味。他們在鞭撻與咀咒的生活之中呻吟着，忍耐着，一直到了不能再忍耐下去的時候，他們終於怒吼起來！他們到底認淸了誰是他們最大的敵人，為了收復他們自己的失地，為了回到他們的故鄉，為了脫出死亡綫而掙扎着生存，他們便將鋤頭之類的農具當作武器，在雄偉的進軍曲中，他們呼喊着收復失地的口號，向帝國主義作最後的搏門了，如上所述，「逃亡」在目前開映，自有其偉大的意義了。</p>
<p>是的，劇作者的用心是好的。他不敢同流合汚的歌舞昇平，他沒有忘懷中國民衆正處在水深火熱的國難之中。他以最大的救亡的熱情，通過電影藝術喚起老百姓抗爭的雄心，以有效的民族戰爭恢復破碎的山河，奪取中華民族自由崗位的存在。但是在創作法　，這並不是完璧無瑕的藝術作品，至少在表現技術上，還有許多値得提川而向編劇導演的作者商榷的地方。同時也有許多優秀的塲合，却也値得提川來向觀衆介紹。</p>
<p>最使我們為之感動的，便是作者以殘酷的描寫，緊抓住觀衆們悲哀的情感。他使秦桐埋在沙堆中祗露出頭頸，我們在愛森斯坦的「墨西哥的暴風雨」中，曾經見過同樣的活埋農奴的畫面，為之大大的感動，現在秦桐的埋在沙漠中，雖然作者沒有明確的吿訴我們，他是被活埋或者是死後的埋葬，可是這殘酷的程度，乃是深刻的刺戟着觀衆的內心。同樣，在難民收容所中，難民們搶不着粥吃還要受鞭撻。至於在沙漠上逃亡的種種，少英叔父的死，父親的受傷，以及少英將叔父所遺下的幼女埋葬，無一不使觀衆，們為之凄然淚下的。</p>
<p>也許有人感覺到塞北的風光，還描寫得不够悵惘與凄凉，但是開始時的牧歌情調，那羊羣的哀嗚，那凄淸的笛聲，那灰色的天空與荒漠的大地，多少是抒情詩似的描寫。至於在那蒼茫的沙漠之中，風沙吹過，難民們忍受飢渴在呻吟，這深重的傷懷，對照着南方的苦雨凄風，完全是另一種苦味。</p>
<p>在「中國海的怒潮」中，我們曾經領略過作者對於羣衆塲面，頗有相當魄力。同樣，在這裏作為劇中精采塲面的帝國主義飛機轟炸，火燒，羣衆的呼號奔跑，對照着前面緊接着賽神的熱鬧，這緊張的悲苦，乃是更顯得有力量的。至於以後打架的一塲，也還可以過得去。</p>
<p>但是同時也有許外缺點，最主要的是在編劇方法上，不能找這一羣反帝抗爭的積極性逐步的提高，甚至於我們祗看到帝國主義的血洗，而看不到一點他們直覺的對敵人憤恨的表現，於是後來以少英為領袖的抗日戰爭，祗覺得是突然與勉强加上去的尾巴。其實，難民的抗日乃是决定了的出路，而是作者避重就輕的不能抓住那必然性的過程。</p>
<p>再有主要的缺點，那便是在導演方法上對於織接法的理解的貧弱。我們看到好些地方　是接不上的。差不多是顧此失彼的，將故事分開來寫，而不能交錯的編　起來。自然也包　不少編劇的錯誤；如小雲的誤入少爺的家及少英的居然找着，都是巧合的利用。如少英兄妹並不知道三姑娘也在室內，居然在緊張的塲合去揭開她的被窩，甚至於三姑娘自殺的過程，都證明導演的處理失當。雖然這些都是劇本的缺點，但是導演不是無法補救的。</p>
<p>再要說到的便是作者對於整個戲的調子了，塞北風光因為少用遠景鏡頭的原故，（如袁美雲唱歌始終就是搖鏡頭。），以致於不能更深刻的給與我們荒漠的感應。有的時候劇的調子過於弛慢，特別是有的搖鏡頭太慢，使人發生滯澀沉悶之感。至於在打架的空氣中揷入極慢的撫尸痛哭，當然破壞了緊張的空氣。</p>
<p>這些，人們也許會因其主題的積極性的感動，而對於這屬於技巧的技節問題，覺得可以不必苛求，但是有了好的用心，而不能更純熟的深刻的表現出來，這使內容的積極性也便失去了它偉大的社會價値；雖然形式不夠表現內容，乃是中國新興電影的通病。不過我們也不會忽視中國電影創造環境的困難，最顯明的是要以「他們」來代替「日帝國主義」字樣，便可知道作者所以要避重就輕的苦心了。</p>
<p>演技，佈景，歌曲皆有較好的成績，祇是配音還沒有選到完善的地步。因限於篇幅，其他從略。</p>
<h3>評「金蓮花」</h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>The　Gilded　Lily—大光明映</p>
<p>繼續着美國影汽目前最流行的作風，「金蓮花」充分的表現着輕妙詼諧的情調。它從頭至尾給與我們快感，而就在這輕妙，風趣中深刻的描寫着劇中人的個性。譬如男主人公皮特，那就是那樣放蕩不覊的，在公園中一定要脫掉鞋子，有的時候忘記了穿鞋便赤脚在地上走的。這種地方，使人不能不笑，同時也覺得他有着可愛的個性。同樣，女主人公瑪琳琍，初次在夜總會歌舞的時候，她忘設了歌詞，她覺得很窘，但是她是很　灑的妙語橫生，聰明伶俐的支持了難堪的局面。固然她不是惡作劇，可是給與你極天眞可愛的印象。這些地方，顯川了導演或演員的靈巧，更主要的是劇作者靑春活潑的風韻，作為成功的基調。</p>
<p>再說罷，劇作者閱世甚深，冷眼旁觀的人生哲學，在男主人公身上作為正面的傳導。他很滿足於自己的職業，不妄想，不苛求，禮拜四偕情人靜坐在公園中吃卜廉，隨便談談，怡然自樂。即使向情人求婚的時候，也不勉强。能結婚，則結婚，否則多等若干時候也沒有什麼關係，滿不在乎。但是他却懂得女人們是不容易完全脫除生活向上之慾望的，甚至於會二使他失去愛情。不過這也不可强求，不妨聽其自然發展。所以當他知道了自己的情人在思慕着英國爵士之子的時候，他雖然有着妒嫉心，但也兩次的不將情敵的照片拋在地上？仍然聳聳肩放回原處。不僅如此，情人要他一同去訪他的情敵（爵士之子）他也樂意隨從。一直到情人覺悟到少爺對她並沒有眞愛的時候，他果然等待着她回到他身邊來。</p>
<p>然而這裏也僅是戀愛的悲喜劇而已，除了愛情的描畫之外，找不着更重要的現實反映。我們一點也不苛求；譬如在極度陷於社會混亂與失業恐慌的美國，男女主人公决不會像劇作者所寫的那般安居樂業的吧？這不能不是意識的粉飾。</p>
<p>是的，這裏祇想成功一個輕鬆的悲喜劇，為了獲得曼妙香甜的情調，無論是導演或演員都是勝任俞快的。也許可以說Wesley　Ruggl，不會像劉別謙或者是卡勃拉，「藝海春光」或「夜風流」的風趣，然而威斯勒魯勒斯决不是一個失敗者，如瑪琳琍在英國突然辭別爵士之子收拾回國的時候，那些新聞記者敏捷的在拍照，便可證明他手法的明快。可是當瑪琳琍和爵士之子在沙灘情話的時候，那作為活動背景的赤脚來往，未免太多了，而成為小疵。克萊黛考爾白的演技，在這類輕鬆的影片中最能發揮，似乎遠在那些古裝的宮闈影片之上。至於男主角自然也是很有成績的了。</p>

<h3>印度亡國恨（Clive　Of　India）　（八）</h3>
<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>克萊夫道：一但是，親愛的我們的錢都化光了。我們一個錢都沒有了。」瑪格勒蒂聽了她丈夫的話，雖然一怔，心中倍覺慘切，但却安慰着他道：一但是我們還有你我，不是嗎？」她說着，忽然看出他的神色有異，不覺駭然問道：一什麽事？」克萊夫很不安的轉側着，一回說道：「不幸中的幸事，正在這惡消息傳來的時候，東印度公司派了人來請我去。他們又要我到印度去了。你想！」</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂急不及待的問道：「怎樣呢？」克萊夫道：「我明天就要啓程。緊急萬分。過了明天，要等好幾個禮拜，才再有船哩的一他說完了，二人相對默然，大家思朝起伏，一時都說不出話來。瑪格勒蒂覺得有一種强大的勢力，它將他們夫婦締結了幾年之後，又要將他們生生的拆開，並且連他們的兒子，都要攫取了去。她外表雖是很鎭靜，但是心內確是方寸已亂，但她還竭力思索着，到底走那條路好。</p>
<p>當克萊夫說話的時候，他當然是希望瑪格勒蒂和他　同去的。她心想倘使她陪了她的丈夫同到印度去了，他們年紀都很輕，克萊夫不過二十五歲，過了幾年他們仍舊回到英國來。那時一定一切都恢復了舊觀，房屋，子女，金錢，快樂無窮。但是她又想到，將來無論如何安富尊榮，他們的第一美滿的夢，巳經成了空了。他們將來子女儘可以有，但是現在的孩子，是不會再回來的了。</p>
<p>她想到這個地方，就不勝悲切起來。她覺得她萬萬不能跟着丈夫到印度去。她一定要陪着她的兒子，直等到他死後。她所想將那殘餘未盡的夢境，溫存在她的心頭，雖然她明明知道那是不可長久的了。最後，她橫了心，將弗立斯勳爵的話說了出來。克萊夫聽了怔了半天，看住了瑪格勒蒂的臉。他然後問道：一眞的嗎？眞的……」一些希望都沒有了嗎？」當瑪格勒蒂默無言，但能低着頭的時候，他亦祇低聲喊了一聲：「孩子……」就也說不川話來了。</p>
<p>過了一回，克萊夫才開口道：「不用記住我說的話。當然你祇可以留在這裏。在母親的心中，當然兒子是第一。」他站了起來，走向樓上的小兒房，那是克萊夫特別為他的兒子佈置的。他問：「我現在可以着看他嗎？」瑪格勒蒂點了點頭。克萊夫又說道：「你去呌僕人替我整理行裝吧。」說着就上樓去了。</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂將女管家，密昔司克里福叫了來，吩咐她替克萊夫整理行裝。她正要出去，瑪格勒蒂又喊住了她。密昔司連忙回來，但是瑪格勒蒂楞了半天說不出說話來。最後，她才說道：「拿我的東西亦整理起來，放在一塊兒。我一回兒就上來帮你。」密昔司不覺奇怪道：「但是……太太……那孩子呢……」</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂連忙阻止她道：「不要管！整理行裝！我呌你整理行裝！整理行裝！」密昔司看了她的女主人那裏悲慘不耐煩的樣子，亦就默然無言地退了出去。瑪格勒蒂等到密昔司克里福退出之後！心想她無論如何，紙好陪她的丈夫，同到印度去了。她的兒子可人叫人服侍，呌專家醫治，直到他脫離慶世的時候為止，但是她的丈夫却是除了她之外，再沒有第二個人可以安慰他　可以遇事商量的了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Yellow River Blocking Project: Kong and Li in Charge of Separate Sections; Hebei Provincial Government Convened a Blocking Conference; 3,800 Yuan Allocated for Emergency Rescue</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Yellow River's water level has risen sharply, making the blocking project urgent. A new engineering office has been formed, with Kong Xianrong responsible for handling the Guantai Gou and Jinmen Ka blocking projects. Li Yizhi is specifically responsible for repairing the Taihang and Jin dikes and rescuing the areas south of Hebei. Hu Yuanhui, the Director of the Hebei Construction Department, is at the construction site and no longer has any responsibility. He will return to Tianjin within the next week. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 23rd, the Hebei Provincial Government convened a conference of various departments to discuss blocking the Yellow River. All department heads attended, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Send a telegram to the magistrate of Changyuan County, urging him to supervise the workers to spare no effort in the blocking efforts, and to formulate methods for rescuing the Taihang and Jin dikes. (2) Send a telegram to the bureau chief, ordering him to meet with the county to survey and set up defenses. (3) Allocate 3,800 yuan from the Yellow River disaster relief funds and remit it to Changyuan for emergency rescue use. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 23rd, the Provincial Government received a telegram from Zhang Qinglu, the magistrate of Changyuan County, stating that the wind had subsided slightly on the 22nd, and the water level had not risen or fallen.

The Hebei Construction Department purchased 5,000 burlap sacks, which were transported to the Yellow River work site on the 23rd for use. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The water level at the Guantai breach of the Yellow River continues to rise, and the situation regarding the blocking project is becoming increasingly critical. Moreover, strong spring winds have been frequent in recent days, causing turbulent waves. The Taihang Dike and the defenses of Changyuan City are under increasing pressure. Furthermore, the Hebei Provincial Government received a telegram on the 23rd from Ye Zhenmin, the surveyor dispatched to Guantai, reporting that refugees are flocking to the disaster area, with people in the surrounding villages having no clothes or food and urgently needing relief. Currently, the number of refugees in Changyuan County has reached 140,000. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Kong Xianrong went to Zhengzhou on the morning of the 23rd to request that the Pinghan Railway allocate trains from Heshan Bridge and the Longhai Railway from Xuzhou to transport stone materials, both starting on the 24th. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) In the past two years, the Yellow River has caused more than 14,000 deaths and losses of more than 30 million yuan in Hua County. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Chang Zhichen returned to Bian on the evening of the 22nd. According to his account: (1) He met with Wang Jingwei and Xu Chongzhi in Beijing, who promised to find ways to provide relief funds for Henan. (2) He planned to establish a Henan Mining Industry Bank in Shanghai, but due to the economic depression, it is unlikely to succeed. (3) He planned to build a cement plant at Tiemen, which will only be decided after a survey by a Swiss company. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhao Mingyuan, the Director of the Immigration Reclamation Office, came to Qi today to meet with Zhang Honglie, the Director of the Construction Department, to urge the relocation of disaster victims to repair the Yellow River's tail reach civil embankments and block the Jingzikou breach to protect the reclamation area. Zhao said that there are currently 4,000 disaster victims from western Shandong who have voluntarily gone to northern Shandong for reclamation. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tax Dispute Between Mongolia and Sui Province Being Mediated; Rumors of Conflict Between Mongolian and Sui Province Armies Unconfirmed; Bao Yueqing Visited He Yingqin Yesterday to Report the Truth</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The tax dispute between Mongolia and Sui Province has intensified. Since Prince De sent a telegram to Xiao Renyuan expressing a complete rejection of the previously agreed-upon resolution at Bailingmiao, there have been widespread rumors here last night of certain actions being taken by both sides. However, it has been learned that this is not the case, although there have been troop movements by both sides. The Sui Province army has approximately two regiments stationed in the Heishata area, while the Mongolian army has approximately 500 men. Prince De has recently returned to Bailingmiao from Heishata, so the situation is still relatively calm. This confirms that the rumors are not true. In order to prevent the situation from escalating, He Yingqin summoned Bao Yueqing, Prince De's representative in Beiping, this morning and informed him that a resolution principle had been established for the dispute. He ordered Bao to immediately telegram Prince De, hoping that Prince De would resolve the issue peacefully, upholding his past loyalty to the Central Government. After taking his leave, Bao telegraphed Prince De and expected a reply to arrive in Beiping tomorrow. According to Bao, the issue should be resolved within a few days.

<h3>Security Team in the Miyun Area; Pursuing and Suppressing Rebel Police with Machine Guns; Yin Rugeng Obtained Japanese Approval; Japanese Army at Gubeikou Jointly Blocking</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Miyun telephone: About two hundred members of Feng Shoupeng's rebel force broke through Malanyu and crossed the Great Wall, then returned to Miyun via Qiangzilu. Our security team immediately surrounded them from the east, south, and west. Because our security team could not advance to the north, the rebels broke through from the north and arrived at a place about one li outside Shixia Town on the morning of the 22nd, cutting the telephone lines and disrupting communication between Beiping and Gubeikou. The security teams of Miyun, Zunhua, and Beiping-Gubeikou counties continued their suppression, engaging in fierce battles, killing dozens of rebels and one security police officer. By evening, the rebels were unable to hold out and retreated twenty li to the west, now in the Donggezhuang area, with a tendency to flee outside the pass. The Japanese army at Gubeikou, upon receiving the news, also dispatched troops to block the passes at Baimaguan and other places. The rebel forces should be resolved within a day or two. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zunhua telephone: After the Zunhua security team was transferred to Miyun to assist in suppressing the rebels, the police force became somewhat thin. On the evening of the 22nd, a group of rebels suddenly rushed into the second district of Zunhua County from the Rehe area, confiscating some of the militia's firearms. The militia police are now jointly suppressing the rebels. The rebels are carrying machine guns, and Yin Rugeng, after being informed, went to the Japanese Embassy this morning to visit Japanese military attache Takahashi to discuss transporting a machine gun unit to the war zone to enable the security team to quickly clear the rebel scourge. It is hoped that there will be no problems after the rebels are quelled before they are removed. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Shoupeng's unit only started to be reorganized on the 22nd. Zhao Lei ordered the officers and soldiers of the unit not to leave the team without permission before the reorganization was completed. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the rebel soldiers of Feng Shoupeng's unit fled to Miyun, they caused great disturbances in the local area. The Ji-Miyun District Office has recently agreed with the Japanese side to allow the security team to temporarily carry six machine guns to suppress the rebels. It is expected that they can be completely annihilated within a few days. The telephone lines between Miyun and Gubeikou, which were cut off by the rebels, have now been repaired by dispatched workers. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Miyun telephone: When the rebel soldiers of Feng Shoupeng's unit were west of Shixia at Donggezhuang last night, they were tracked and pursued by the security team to the Taiziling area, where one rebel was captured, along with a large gun, a bicycle, and one rebel was killed. One person was captured alive, several rebels were wounded, and several mules and horses were seized. Two hostages were rescued. The Japanese army at Gubeikou dispatched troops to defend at Baimaguan. The Japanese side contacted Zhang Wen, the magistrate of Miyun County, by telephone to agree on a joint suppression. Feng's rebels are still hiding in the Xiaoshijian Mountain. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The unresolved issues in the Hebei war zone, after being discussed and decided by personnel from both China and Japan in Tianjin, are being handled in three steps. The first step, the issue of the Yutian security team being transferred, has been completed. The Feng Shoupeng unit transferred to Tangshan is undergoing training. The Sun Jizhou unit transferred to the Tongxian-Sanhe border area is being reorganized and trained under the command of General Team Leader Li Yuncheng, as ordered by the Ji-Miyun District Office. The second step, the issue of the new security team entering the area, is still under slight revision because we have 9,000 trained men, but only 5,000 are being deployed. The deployment is expected to be negotiated and finalized after Yu Xuezhong returns to Tianjin. The third step, the issue of receiving Malanyu Dongling, has been referred to the Japanese Kwantung Army by Japanese military attache Takahashi. The Japanese side has proposed conditions, such as resolving issues related to the protection of Dongling before it can be returned. This issue is being negotiated with the Japanese side by Gu Rugeng and others, and it will take some time. There are approximately 20,000 impoverished descendants of the Qing dynasty in Dongling. They established a Forestry Reclamation Bureau and cleared the forests in the area from Dongling to Xinglong, which took seven or eight years, showing the extent of the loss. The Ji-Miyun District Office plans to carry out afforestation and farming after receiving Dongling to provide a livelihood for tens of thousands of Banner people. However, how to raise this funding is still a matter of concern. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dagdong Company in Yuguan to Resell Exit Permits</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Dagdong Company in Yuguan issued a notice on the 20th of this month, stating that the company had previously been ordered to stop selling "entry permits" in accordance with the regulations for the control of foreigners entering the country. Now, they have been ordered to resume the sale of "entry permits" from April 1st, which will be sold by both the company and the Japanese Military Police in Yuguan for 3 jiao each. However, people entering the country must first fill out their resumes at the company or the military police station. It is heard that the Japanese were preventing Chinese from leaving the customs, and after negotiations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the relevant authorities in North China, the Japanese side agreed to postpone it for one year. Therefore, the Dagdong Company in Yuguan was ordered to implement it. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 23rd, the Beiping-Shenyang Railway Bureau submitted a report detailing the investigation of the false police in Shanhaiguan preventing Chinese from leaving the customs, to the Military Branch and the Ministry of Railways, requesting instructions for compliance.

<h3>Reorganization Plan for Oriental Travel Agency; Will Be Implemented Next Month</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The reorganization plan for the Oriental Travel Agency has been largely finalized. The International Tourism Bureau will still be responsible for it in the coming days. Deputy Manager Hirayama will remain in place. After our side, the China Travel Agency, withdraws, Zhang Shuiqi and personnel familiar with the transportation industry will form a Chinese capital group for the Beiping-Shenyang special express train. The reorganization is expected to be realized around the 15th of next month. The Japanese side objects to changing the name and having private individuals take over the Oriental Travel Agency. Therefore, our country is forming a capital group to be responsible for the travel agency. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The capital of the Oriental Travel Agency is currently set at 2 million yuan to purchase two trains and build a railway hotel in Shanhaiguan. It was agreed to raise one-quarter of the capital first. Subsequently, after starting the business, only one-eighth of the capital was raised, with China and Japan each responsible for 125,000 yuan, which has been used up in losses in the past six months. After the reorganization, the remaining capital will continue to be paid up and stored in the company for future use. As for purchasing trains, we have rejected the Japanese proposal due to issues of sovereignty and complex relationships. Zhang Shuiqi may go to Beiping at the end of the month to meet with Yin Tong to discuss everything in advance. The operating expenses of the Oriental Travel Agency in the past were too high, with ordinary employee salaries exceeding 200 yuan. After the reorganization, this may be reduced. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A reorganization meeting for the Oriental Travel Agency will be held in Beiping on the 5th of next month, with Yin Tong, Takahashi, Hirayama, and Zhang Shuiqi as the central figures for negotiations between China and Japan. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

The handling fee charged by the railway bureau will be waived. Since the 21st, the situation of the pseudo-border police preventing passengers from leaving the customs has eased slightly. However, there are still thousands of passengers staying in the Yutai Hotel in Yuguan, waiting for letters of certification from relatives and friends outside the customs as proof to leave. Large and small hotels and inns are overcrowded. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The pseudo-Dagdong Company in Shanhaiguan posted a notice on the 22nd, stating that it had previously been ordered to stop issuing entry permits and that it would resume the old method of selling them from April 1st, charging 5 jiao per permit. However, when purchasing, one must attach proof and the permission of the Japanese Military Police. The Beiping-Shenyang Railway Bureau denies that it is providing free transportation back to Beiping and Tianjin for passengers prevented from leaving the customs in Yuguan. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Will the United States Really Abandon the Philippines?</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The Philippine Constitution, which began drafting at the end of July last year and was completed in February this year, will be approved by US President Roosevelt today. On the surface, it is a success for the Philippine national independence movement, but in reality, it is a clever application of the United States' hegemonic strategy.</p>
<p>The United States occupied the Philippines after Japan's great victory in the Sino-Japanese War. At that time, the powers were delineating spheres of influence in China, and the United States was unwilling to lag behind. Taking advantage of Spain's weakness and exhaustion, it seized the territory as a base for operating in the Far East. However, the territory is close to Taiwan, which is sufficient to obstruct Japan's ambition to advance south. Therefore, the Japanese resented it deeply. The situation of Japanese-American competition in the Pacific was thus created. Later, Japan formed an alliance with Britain and defeated Tsarist Russia in a major war. Its power gradually increased, while the United States was rich in wealth, and its trade in the Far East also made significant progress. The two sides became evenly matched and competed with each other. When the European War broke out, Japan suddenly occupied the Caroline Islands to cut off the connection between Honolulu and the Philippines. The United States felt greatly threatened and sought ways to deal with it. Intervention at the Paris Peace Conference failed, so it advocated the League of Nations to make the Caroline Islands a mandated territory in an attempt to salvage the situation. Later, the Washington Conference brought together various countries to restrain Japan with international treaties. These are all past events of the United States occupying the Philippines to compete with Japan for hegemony in the Far East.</p>
<p>Today, the situation in the Pacific is quite dangerous, and the United States has expressed its intention to abandon the Philippines. Why is this? It can be said that the United States has never intended to abandon it, but rather to retreat in order to advance. In other words, the United States' governance of colonies is based on the history of its own establishment and its long-standing declarations on international politics, and it always pretends to be enlightened. Japan took advantage of this to promote the Philippine independence movement. This is the first source of the United States' distress and frustration. The United States' mainland and the Philippines are separated by a vast ocean, and it is inherently difficult to defend against the prying eyes of other countries geographically. Japan has already occupied the Caroline Islands and is relentless in its southward advance policy, further threatening the Philippines. This is the second source of the United States' distress and frustration. Since the world economic recession, the United States has gradually become uneasy about the import of Philippine agricultural products and the entry of Filipinos. In the promotion of the recovery movement, it is one of the major problems that urgently needs to be resolved. This is the third source of the United States' distress and frustration. With these three points, coupled with Japan's urgent pursuit of its Asia Monroe Doctrine since the September 18th Incident, the re-establishment of military facilities in the Caroline Islands, and even disregarding everything by withdrawing from the League of Nations and declaring the abandonment of the treaties established at the Washington Conference, the United States was forced by the situation to have this plan to retreat in order to advance.</p>
<p>This is from the perspective of international relations. If we observe it from the perspective of military action, the United States Navy's actions in the Pacific have always been centered on the Panama Canal and San Francisco-Honolulu, focusing on the South Pacific. This year's exercises are being conducted between San Francisco-Honolulu and Alaska, and there is even a proposal to build a port at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands. The United States' military actions have shifted their focus, and it is natural to make a retreat in the Philippines. However, this is only a retreat and cannot be called abandonment. Although the Taft-McDuffie Act on Philippine independence, which was decided last year, has complied with the Philippine people's request to withdraw the stationed army after the declaration of independence, it still declares that naval bases will be temporarily retained. Moreover, since the Taft-McDuffie Act began to be implemented, the United States has never relaxed its control over the Philippines politically. The national defense plan proposed by the Philippine Constitutional Convention was returned by Governor Murphy, stating that the United States is still responsible for protection until the Philippines is fully independent and that national defense issues are not yet essential. What is the meaning of this move? It is clear to anyone with intelligence. Moreover, the constitution clearly stipulates that after the establishment of a republican government in the Philippines, it will still recognize the sovereignty of the United States, and officials must swear allegiance to the United States. What independence is this? It is better to say that in the economic field, its control methods are even more advanced. The policy of controlling imported goods and adopting a proportional system will be implemented by the republican government to protect American goods and exclude Japanese goods. As for the restrictions on Filipinos going to the United States, the forced management of Philippine cotton production, the prohibition of Philippine sugar imports into the United States, and the recent temporary suspension of business talks between the Philippine delegation to the United States and American officials, it is even more evident that the United States is using the fine name of granting independence to the Philippines to resolve the above-mentioned triple distress with one stroke.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the US President's approval of the Philippine Constitution is a considerable success for the Philippine national movement, and we deeply sympathize with its spirit of fighting for national independence and freedom. However, at the same time, we cannot but point out that the United States has no intention of completely abandoning the Philippines, and the United States' granting of independence to the Philippines is not enough to resolve the disputes and problems between Japan and the United States in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Hirota delivered the following speech at the signing ceremony of the Chinese Eastern Railway agreement today: The negotiation on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway issue has lasted for 21 months and has finally been fully completed. The signing of the relevant documents today will definitely make a great contribution to the promotion of peace in East Asia and the world. I am extremely pleased. The relationship between Russia and Manchukuo will enter a new era with the establishment of this agreement. I hope that friendly relations will increase, and the world in East Asia will become brighter as a result. This is truly the result of the Soviet Russian government's firm determination to resolve the Chinese Eastern Railway issue and the spirit of cooperation of the "Manchukuo" government. The Japanese government has been in the middle, and has been enthusiastically mediating to make the negotiation possible. This is what I, the Minister, am most pleased about. When we think of the important significance of this negotiation, the various twists and turns and difficulties of the past two years are not worth mentioning. In addition to the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, there are still various pending issues between Japan, Russia, and Manchukuo. However, I firmly believe that if we conduct negotiations with the spirit of harmony and cooperation demonstrated in this negotiation, then a satisfactory solution will not be difficult. (23rd Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Russian Minister's Thanks</p>

<p>South Manchuria Railway Entrusted to Operate</p>
<p>After the official signing ceremony was completed on the 23rd, the South Manchuria Railway Company will receive an order from the "Manchukuo" government to operate the Chinese Eastern Railway. The South Manchuria Railway authorities issued the following statement: As a result of the agreement reached between Russia and Manchukuo, the Chinese Eastern Railway is now wholly owned by "Manchukuo." The "Manchukuo" government believes that it is most appropriate for the South Manchuria Railway, which is familiar with the railway business, to operate the state-owned railway. It has previously entrusted this company to operate all domestic railways. Now, it has entrusted the South Manchuria Railway to operate the Chinese Eastern Railway. This will not only unify all the railways in Manchuria under a single company, but also maximize economic and technical efficiency. It will definitely make a significant contribution to the development of transportation and industry. This is the reason why the "Manchukuo" government entrusted the South Manchuria Railway to operate the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the South Manchuria Railway has no reason to refuse. Therefore, it has decided to accept the entrustment. (The content of the contract signed between the "Manchukuo" government and the South Manchuria Railway authorities is omitted.) (23rd Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Chinese Eastern Railway's previous freight rates were based on Vladivostok and had many types and complicated calculations. Not only were the railway staff burdened with tedious tasks, but also the business of merchants was greatly inconvenienced. The South Manchuria Railway authorities believe that this price list is not in line with the "Manchukuo"'s principle of equal opportunity for opening up. They decided to sacrifice millions of yuan in profit each year and reduce freight rates. A new price list was released on the 23rd and applied immediately. The result is that the first-class ticket from Changchun to Harbin is reduced by 5.7 yuan, the second-class ticket is reduced by 1.6 yuan, and the third-class ticket is reduced by 1.02 yuan. (23rd Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Harbin Railway Bureau Director Sawara Kenji issued a proclamation on the 23rd, stating that the Chinese Eastern Railway is entrusted by the "Manchukuo" government to the Railway General Bureau to manage all affairs, and is under the management of the Harbin Railway Bureau and will continue to operate. Manchu railway employees will be railway bureau employees from this day on and will have their status guaranteed. However, Russian railway employees will resign from their positions within three months in accordance with the agreement. However, those who resign will be fully paid their retirement benefits, deposits, and allowances. Those who wish to retain their original positions may continue to be employed. Connecting adjacent railways and developing local culture and industry are the important missions of this railway. It is hoped that all employees will be responsible and fulfill their duties. Violators will be punished in accordance with national law. (23rd Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Handover</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Chinese Eastern Railway has now been renamed the North Manchuria Railway. The original Russian-Manchu board of directors held its final meeting this morning. The meeting received a telegram from Changchun stating that after the transfer agreement was officially signed in Tokyo, the "Manchu" Minister of Communications Ding Jianxi declared the dissolution of the board of directors, and Li Shaogeng and the Russian side, Bandura, each read the confirmation bulletin of their respective governments. The Russian-Manchu flag hanging in the building was then lowered and replaced with the "Manchu" flag. At the same time, the handover was completed. The new appointees have taken over all stations on the southern, eastern, and western sections. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Hitler Intends to Expand Navy</p>
<p>(Berlin) Officials stated today that during tomorrow's meeting between leader Hitler and British Foreign Secretary Simon, Germany may demand a larger navy in addition to conscription, as Hitler considers the security of the army and navy to be a fundamental policy. If other countries do not recognize this policy, Germany will not return to the League of Nations. If Germany cannot stand on an absolutely equal footing with related countries, it is doubtful that Hitler will accept the air force pact proposed by Britain and France. However, German Foreign Minister Neurath told an Associated Press reporter that the meeting between Foreign Secretary Simon and leader Hitler would benefit all of Europe.

<h3>German Navy Improves Torpedoes; Propelled by Electricity, Leaves No Wake</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph reports that the German Navy has made significant improvements to its torpedoes. In the future, they will be propelled by electricity, leaving no trace on the surface of the water.

<h3>Bound by the Treaty of Versailles; Germany Can No Longer Endure; Entrusts Security to its Own Strength</h3>
<p>Port of Hanover, Germany: Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech here today, stating, "Germany can no longer endure the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles. If we wish to liberate ourselves, we must adopt revolutionary measures in domestic affairs, and their impact will inevitably extend to foreign affairs. This is why the government, on March 16th, entrusted the responsibility of maintaining national security to the strength of the German people themselves." Goebbels then discussed the issue of foreign currency shortages, stating that Germany must import large quantities of raw materials to manufacture industrial products in order to prevent unemployment. This is the reason for imports exceeding exports and the shortage of foreign currency, which the people must endure. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Premier Encourages Blackshirt Comrades; Maintain Peace with Arms; Orders Conscription; Prepared for Any Eventuality</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian Premier Mussolini delivered a highly impassioned speech to several thousand Blackshirt comrades this afternoon, stating that our desire for peace is rooted in millions of bayonets.

(National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy is clearly wary of Germany's rearmament. Today, Italian Premier Mussolini issued an order summoning a large number of conscripts into the army. Approximately half of the 1911 class of conscripts were already called up last month to serve in Italian Somaliland. The remaining individuals were all ordered to be called up today. It is reported that this move will bring the number of Italians bearing arms to 650,000, in addition to the 400,000 members of the Fascist militia armed with rifles and machine guns, bringing the total strength of Italy's armed forces to over one million.

<h3>French Government Decides to Increase Professional Army; Extends Term of Service for New Recruits</h3>

In addition, the government requests that from 1936 to 1940, the age for new recruits to join the army be gradually lowered from 21 to 20. At the same time, it will intensify the recruitment of a professional army. All personnel reorganizations will be carried out within the scope of the 1928 conscription law. This proposal has been submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for review. The Army Committee discussed it yesterday, with Army Minister Maurin personally attending to provide explanations.

<h3>Simon Speaks; Britain is Pragmatic; Devoted to the Cause of Peace; Unwilling to Make Adventurous Attempts</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon stated in a speech near Lichfield, "British people must work together with one heart and one mind on the issue of peace-building. If there are differences of opinion, conflicting goals, and scattered energy, then regardless of the reason, it will not benefit peace. We cannot attempt various adventurous actions in foreign countries, nor can we be bound by anyone's disputes. It must be known that this is not conducive to the cause of peace, and it is contrary to the pragmatic mindset of the British people." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Germany Assures France and Italy that it Will Not Station Troops in the Rhineland</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to reliable sources, Foreign Minister Neurath, while rejecting the points raised in France's protest letter, offered assurances to the French ambassador that there was no intention to abolish the demilitarized zone in the Rhineland. Subsequently, the same assurances were given to the Italian ambassador. If so, Germany will not station troops in the Rhineland province and within 50 kilometers of the right bank of the Rhine River. Leaders of the National Socialist Party believe that the protest letters from Italy and France are mere empty words, stating that the progress of events cannot be stopped by anything. German sources previously stated that since the right to military equality had been realized, they would no longer oppose returning to Geneva. French political figures deeply believe that this is a new strategy by Germany, hoping that Britain will feel satisfied with this "magnanimous act." (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Hull Advocates Respect for Treaties; No Less Than a Subtle Criticism of Germany; Generally Believed to be a Prelude to Action</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull stated definitively during a meeting with reporters today the necessity of strictly adhering to various treaties, and said that U.S. officials are closely watching the European situation. Judging from his remarks, they contain the intention of the U.S. government not supporting Germany's rearmament. However, Hull was unwilling to disclose what actions the United States would take. According to observers, Hull's remarks on the dignity of treaties are a prelude to some kind of action by the United States. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Berlin Daily News criticized U.S. Secretary of State Hull's declaration yesterday, stating that the United States should use its spiritual strength to ensure that various treaties are strictly adhered to. The newspaper said Hull's words are "voicing support for French extremism" and are a subtle criticism of Germany. It is understood that "although Germany recognizes that treaties can establish peace in Europe, there are many different kinds of treaties and they cannot be generalized." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Conflicting Opinions Among Americans</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, so the issue of Germany's rearmament should be completely ignored. However, another member of the committee, Democrat Pope, stated that under the current circumstances, if war breaks out in Europe, the United States would be unable to maintain neutrality, and domestic industrialists and cotton planters would inevitably exert strong pressure on the government and Congress to ensure that maritime trade routes remain unobstructed (meaning maintaining the principle of freedom of the seas).

<h3>Following Germany's Lead; Austria Rearms; Existing Standing Army is Insufficient to Cope with Events; France Will Assist in Forming a Military Plan to Encircle Germany</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Austria joined the rearmament movement today. The Department of the Army has summoned all reserve officers for training in order to train a powerful new army. These officers have been ordered to report by March 30th. Specific plans have not been announced, but unofficial sources claim that the government is planning to restore nationwide conscription soon. However, observers express skepticism about Austria following Germany's lead in rearming. It is understood that the government believes that other major powers have increased their military strength, and therefore it cannot deny Austria the right to expand its military organization. Austria currently has a standing army of 30,000 men. Premier Schuschnigg believes that this is insufficient to cope with any major events. Current government officials are indeed friendly with France and Britain and oppose Hitler's policies. They have great influence over Austria's rearmament plan. It is said that France will help Austria obtain a larger army in order to complete its military plan to encircle Germany. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>American Cotton: The opening price of the New York cotton market today was similar to yesterday's closing price. The market situation was more likely to fall, because of the brokers settling and foreign sales. Domestic counterparts bought in a little, anticipating that manufacturers will replenish some to offset sales before the price changes occur.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: Inflation is now the main topic of conversation for Wall Street operators. After the bonus gold case was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday, talk of inflation is rampant again. However, although this case was passed by the House of Representatives by a large majority, those in charge do not hold much hope that it can be passed by the Senate, and the inevitable presidential veto must also be taken into account. President Roosevelt's opposition to the current form of the bonus gold case is well known, so if the inflationary nature of this case is not removed by the Senate, then this case may not become law. Before the opening of the securities market this morning, it was said that the market situation would definitely be affected by talk of inflation. However, although the market situation was slightly active at the opening, price fluctuations were still uneven. Public utility stocks were initially bought in, but as prices rose slightly, pressure followed. As a result, most stock prices still fell below yesterday's closing prices. Steel stocks opened up 25, at 30.25, but in less than 20 minutes, they fell to 29.75. Railway stocks did not change much. The New York securities market prices are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Stagnation in the Anhui Tea Market; Tight Credit Situation in Shanghai Reduces Lending by Tea Warehouses; Tea Merchants View Business with Trepidation After Droughts and Banditry</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The tea market in southern Anhui, which takes in Huizhou prefecture, has had a bountiful year. Trade and exports may take in around 20 million yuan in cash, which is truly vital for the livelihood of the people of Huizhou. The new tea will soon be available. In past years, at this time, Shanghai warehouses would extend loans to the countryside, tea merchants would raise funds to establish firms, and the tea market would be active. However, this spring, the weather has been warm and tea buds have flourished everywhere, but the activities of tea merchants are far less than before. It is said that one reason is that the establishment of tea firms in Huizhou depends on the amount of loans extended by Shanghai tea warehouses. In recent years, the credit situation in Shanghai has been extremely tight. Banks and money shops have adopted a tight lending policy to tea warehouses. Therefore, tea warehouses have had to narrow the scope of lending to tea firms. Furthermore, Huizhou was previously occupied and disturbed by bandits, causing great harm. Many wealthy families and tea merchants have taken refuge elsewhere. Although the banditry has been completely eliminated, distant places seem to still have some misunderstandings about the situation in Huizhou, causing some concerns. Therefore, there are only a few Shanghai warehouse merchants who have come to Huizhou, no more than three or so. The amount of money they plan to lend is also less than three-fifths of what they lent in previous years. The majority of other warehouse merchants are still considering and watching. As a result, tea merchants are waiting quietly for the arrival of warehouse merchants, and the tea market has fallen into a state of stagnation. Although some tea merchants used to have substantial assets, they have been repeatedly hit by droughts and banditry, and their economies have been severely damaged. The people's strength has declined sharply. In addition, the tea industry has suffered losses in foreign trade over the years, making investment in tea firms even more of a cause for trepidation. According to those familiar with the tea situation in Shanghai, the total amount of loans planned by Shanghai warehouses this year is less than six-tenths of last year. Based on this calculation, it is feared that no more than a hundred tea firms will be established this year. Liu Zhenhua, the chairman of Anhui Province, believes that Huizhou has been greatly damaged by bandits. Relying solely on fundraising for relief is not only practically difficult, but also difficult to achieve universal effect. Therefore, he attaches great importance to the revival of the Huizhou tea market. After clearing out the bandits, he immediately placed advertisements in various newspapers, hoping to recall the displaced people of Huizhou and encourage them to return to their homes as soon as possible so as not to miss the tea farming season again. The recovery of the tea market is the only way for the people of Huizhou to help themselves. However, the 383rd Regiment of the 64th Division stationed in Huizhou was originally planned to be transferred back to Qimen for consolidation pending departure from Huizhou. Later, in response to the request of the Tea Industry Association, it was ordered to continue to be stationed in various parts of Huizhou to be responsible for protecting the tea market and to search for remnant bandits in the mountainous areas between Qimen and Dezhou.

<h3>Songjiang: Red Cross Branch Requests Preservation of Nijiatan</h3>
<p>Li Xiuzhe of the Chinese Red Cross Society Sijing Branch and Zhou Xuewen of the Songjiang Branch recently submitted a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that Nijiatan, located south of Malu Bridge outside the West Gate of Songjiang County, was originally the burial place of martyrs who died during the late Ming Dynasty and the Taiping Rebellion. The local gentry, Jiang Shilin, and others submitted a report to the county government in October of the fourth year of the Republic of China to prohibit the sale of the land. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the people of Songjiang felt grateful to the Western missionary, Bu Huilian, for his efforts in maintaining the local area during repeated wars and raised funds to build a pavilion on it as a memorial. Unexpectedly, some unscrupulous local bullies have sold the land for profit, and seventy or eighty workers are transporting bricks and soil away every day, destroying graves. (Recently, a group of local bullies have made destroying ancient tombs their only quick way to make money.) They have also dismantled and destroyed the Bu Huilian Memorial Pavilion. If this trend continues, conspiracies will breed. Therefore, they appealed to the government of Songjiang County to immediately and strictly stop this practice and thoroughly investigate the sale of the land in order to comfort the loyal souls and protect the historical sites.</p>

<h3>Wuxi: Refugees Commit Robbery with Weapons in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>At about 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, six refugee boats from other provinces arrived in Dajishan, Kaiyuan Township, Fourth District. Seeing that the house of Zhu De Kui was tall and large, they knew that he was wealthy. They rushed ashore and broke into Zhu's house, pulled out weapons, and threatened him not to make a sound. They tied up and beat Zhu's wife, Mrs. Zhang, and ordered her to tell them where the silver was hidden. Then, they wantonly searched and robbed, taking a pair of gold bracelets, seven gold rings, and more than ten dan of rice, totaling a loss of 1,000 yuan. After obtaining the stolen goods, the refugees returned to their boats, raised their sails, and fled towards Huzhou.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Financial Bonds to Increase Capital for Three Banks</h3>
<p>Central and Communications Banks decide to submit proposal at the upcoming shareholders' meeting; Director of Public Debt arrives in Shanghai to discuss issuance methods</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports: In order to rescue the market, the Ministry of Finance is issuing 100 million yuan of financial bonds for the 24th year of the Republic of China to supplement the capital of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. These three banks have separately scheduled general shareholders' meetings and board meetings to submit and approve the proposal. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Director Jiang Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Issuance</p>
<p>The 150 million yuan financial bonds for the 24th year of the Republic of China have been approved by the Central Political Conference and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. After the regulations are passed, they will be issued immediately. Jiang Lufu, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, arrived in Shanghai from the capital the day before yesterday and immediately met with Minister Kong Xiangxi to request instructions on everything. At the same time, yesterday afternoon, he met with Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, to discuss the issuance of financial bonds. It is heard that it has been decided to handle it according to past methods, so the issuance of these bonds is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>Total Capital of the Central Bank Increased</p>
<p>The total capital of the Central Bank is 20 million yuan in national currency, and the paid-in capital is 20 million yuan in national currency, allocated by the Ministry of Finance. Last year, the government decided to expand the capital of the bank to 100 million yuan, so this time another 30 million yuan of financial bonds for the 24th year of the Republic of China will be allocated to make up the difference. According to the regulations, "If it is necessary to increase capital due to business needs, the board of directors shall decide, the board of supervisors shall agree, and the matter shall be submitted to the National Government for approval to expand the total capital, and commercial shares may be solicited, but commercial shares shall not exceed 49% of the total capital."

This time, 25 million yuan of financial bonds for the 24th year of the Republic of China will be allocated to increase capital, bringing the total to 50 million yuan. (2) Bank of Communications (National Industrial Development Bank): The total capital is 10 million yuan in national currency, and the paid-in capital is 8,715,600 yuan in national currency. The number of shares is 100,000, each share being 100 yuan. The government owns 20,000 shares, that is, 2 million yuan, and commercial shares are 80,000 shares, that is, 8 million yuan. This time, 10 million yuan of financial bonds for the 24th year of the Republic of China will be allocated to increase capital, bringing the total to 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Regulations Stipulate Shareholder Approval</p>
<p>Article 2 of the regulations of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications stipulates that "If it is necessary to increase capital stock due to business needs, the matter may be decided by the general shareholders' meeting and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval." A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency specifically inquired with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications yesterday and learned that the regular general shareholders' meetings of the two banks have been scheduled to be held in Shanghai, and all shareholders have been notified. The proposal to allocate the capital of the two banks with the financial bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance in the 24th year of the Republic of China will be submitted to the regular general shareholders' meeting for approval and then submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<h3>Hunan Province's Million-Dollar Mortgage Loan Agreement Signed Yesterday Afternoon</h3>

<p>The Xinxin News Agency reports: The Hunan Provincial Government mortgaged the Hunan Provincial Construction Bonds with a face value of 1,666,000 yuan to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications for a loan of 1 million yuan.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Telephone Price Increase After Discussion; Maximum Increase of 12.5% Requires Consent of the French Concession; Other Matters Concerning Management Fees to Be Discussed Separately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company petitioned the Municipal Council to revise the tariff rates starting from April of this year. The Municipal Council has now allowed the company to increase its total revenue by a maximum of 12.5%. The company must separately draft new tariff regulations, carefully allocate them, and then wait for review and decision. It is also reported that the company has recently claimed that the number of telephones has decreased by about 1,000 in the past two and a half months, while the previous estimate was that it could increase by 800. Therefore, due to the difference between the two, future income will be far less than expected. The contents of the company's petition and the discussion of the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Assets and Liabilities</p>
<p>According to the company's report, as of 1934, the investment items included capital stock of 8,052,000 yuan (all calculated in Chinese national currency, omitting thousands), company bonds of 24,675,000 yuan, and loans with a term of more than one year of 2,098,000 yuan, totaling 34,825,000 yuan. The company's income, including telephone charges and other income for that year, was 6,625,000 yuan. The expenditure items included telephone service fees of 1,025,000 yuan, maintenance fees of 875,000 yuan, business expenses of 695,000 yuan, depreciation of 1,597,000 yuan, and donations and taxes of 140,000 yuan, totaling 4,332,000 yuan. After deducting interest and other payments of more than 130,000 yuan, the net profit was 2,159,000 yuan, equivalent to about 6.13% of the investment.</p>
<p>New Tariff Method</p>
<p>According to the company's franchise contract, the company should have a net profit annual interest rate of 1% (i.e., 8%) plus a reserve fund of 2% starting from April last year. Therefore, according to the company's calculation, based on the figures for 1934, there is still a shortage of about 1,362,000 yuan in income. In order to make up for this shortage, the company intends to increase the current telephone charges by an average of 23% (22.89%). For this purpose, the company proposes to revise the tariff method, the most important of which is to change all commercial telephones to a per-call charging method.</p>
<p>Commercial Telephones</p>
<p>The current commercial telephones have two types of charges: one is fixed, at 12.24 yuan per line per month, and the other is limited to 300 calls for 12.24 yuan, 500 calls for 13.8 yuan, 700 calls for 15.69 yuan, and an additional charge of 0.0559 yuan per call for more than 700 calls. The company intends to uniformly change to a per-call charge, with 10 yuan per month for 100 calls or less, an additional charge of 0.05 yuan per call for 100 to 200 calls, an additional charge of 0.04 yuan per call for 200 to 300 calls, and an additional charge of 0.03 yuan per call for more than 300 calls.</p>
<p>Residential Telephones</p>
<p>The current telephone charge for residential telephones is 7.58 yuan per month, and the company intends to increase it to 8.5 yuan. In addition, the fees for private lines, extension lines, and branch lines, and branch line exchanges will all be increased, while the fees for switching and reconnecting will be reduced. The installation and relocation fees, which were previously uniformly 13.99 yuan, will be changed to 15 yuan for commercial use and 10 yuan for home use in the future. The total result of various increases and decreases is estimated to increase total revenue by about 22.89%. According to this method, the company can obtain an average net profit of 10.08% per year from April 1 of this year to April 1, 1937.</p>
<p>Discussion Process</p>
<p>The company's request to increase prices has been discussed in detail by the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council. At the same time, the Foreign Exchange Brokers Association, the Japanese Residents Group, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce have all sent letters to the Municipal Council expressing their objections. The basis for the company's calculation of profits and losses, such as the issue of income tax payable to the United States, the issue of depreciation reserve funds, and the management fees paid to the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, all need to be studied. And the company's prediction that the number of calls will be reduced by half after charging by the number of calls seems to be too optimistic. According to the opinion of the Director of Finance, the income tax item (according to the company's calculation, 850,000 yuan will be needed in the next two years) is not within the scope of the contract and should not be borne by the users. Regarding the depreciation item, the Municipal Council assisted the company with a loan at the end of the previous year to convert its foreign currency debts into silver currency debts. Therefore, the investment should be reduced by 3 million yuan, and the annual depreciation amount can also be greatly reduced as a result. As for the management fees paid to the International Company, which are calculated at 4.5% of the total income per year, requiring about 300,000 yuan, this matter should not be a burden for Shanghai for a long time. Therefore, according to the opinion of the Director of Finance, if the company's income can increase by 12.5% per year, it will be enough for the company to obtain a net profit of 1%. As for the distribution items of the price increase, it should be further considered. According to the company's opinion, if the shareholders cannot obtain a considerable interest, it will be difficult to raise capital again in the future. However, the Director of Finance said that if the 12.5% ​​quota is collected, the shareholders can actually obtain a dividend of about 1.5%, and future expansion will no longer require huge sums of money, and it may be possible to raise funds locally. However, from the perspective of the Municipal Council, other public utilities can all pay dividends on time, so it seems impossible not to allow the telephone company to obtain a considerable profit. Moreover, in the past fifteen months, the company's operating expenses have been saved by about 400,000 yuan per year, and there is no problem with its engineering efficiency. Furthermore, according to the company's calculation two years ago, the price increase needs to be more than 40% in order to reach the conditions permitted by the contract. After using various methods to deal with it, the current increase is only 12.5%, which can be said to have reasonable protection for the interests of users.</p>
<p>Permission to Increase</p>
<p>After careful consideration, the Public Utilities Committee decided to recommend to the board of directors that the company be allowed to increase its income by a maximum of 12.5% ​​starting from April 1 of this year, but it must also obtain the consent of the French Concession authorities, and the allocation method of the price increase must also be permitted by the two concessions. As for other issues such as income tax, depreciation, and management fees, they will be discussed separately.</p>
<h3>Two US Inspection Delegations Scheduled to Arrive in China One After Another; Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Inspection Delegation to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; US Economic Inspection Delegation to Arrive on the 22nd of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reports: The Far East Commercial Inspection Delegation organized by the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce of the United States, consisting of more than 20 people, has arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the President Hoover. It is expected to arrive at the port on the afternoon of the 25th. As for the Far East Economic Inspection Delegation organized by the American International Association, it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd of next month. All sectors of the city have prepared to welcome them. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Inspection Delegation</p>
<p>The Far East Commercial Inspection Delegation organized by the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce of the United States, consisting of more than 20 people, arrived in Hong Kong from the Philippines on the 22nd and took the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover to Shanghai on the 22nd. According to the company's news, the President Hoover is scheduled to arrive at the port at 4:30 PM on the 25th and dock at the Bailianjing Pier in Pudong. According to the Xinxin News Agency reporter, the members of the delegation are all well-known American businessmen. Their task is to investigate the commercial situation of the United States in China. Therefore, after the delegation arrives in Shanghai, it will go to Hangzhou and then to North China for investigation. After staying in China for about three weeks, it plans to go to Kobe and return to the country.</p>
<p>US Far East Economic Inspection Delegation</p>
<p>The American Far East Business Economic Inspection Delegation organized by the American International Association, consisting of 16 members, is composed of well-known figures from various sectors such as finance, industry, and transportation in the United States. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency went to the China International Trade Association yesterday morning to inquire about the delegation's arrival in China. According to the association, the delegation has already departed from San Francisco for China on the 22nd and will arrive in Yokohama, Japan on April 5th. It will arrive in Shanghai on April 22nd. After the delegation arrives in Shanghai, it plans to divide into teams to investigate the actual situation in the interior, and then return to Shanghai to discuss the development of Sino-US trade issues with various sectors at home and abroad before returning to the country on schedule.</p>
<p>The Two Delegations Have Different Missions in China</p>
<p>Although the names of the two inspection delegations are similar, they have different purposes. The Far East Commercial Inspection Delegation organized by the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce of the United States aims only to understand the recent commercial situation of the United States in China so that it can have a better understanding of Sino-US trade in the future. It is entirely a commercial organization. As for the Far East Economic Inspection Delegation organized by the American International Trade Association, its mission is more important. The purpose of the delegation is to collect various materials needed for Sino-US trade, as well as the situation of American investment in China, and to study methods for developing Sino-US trade with our country. Therefore, its mission has an important meaning for the entire future of Sino-US trade.</p>
<p>Various Circles in China and the United States Prepare to Welcome Them</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the National Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, the China International Trade Association, and other organizations believe that the American Far East Business Economic Inspection Delegation's visit to China for investigation will be of considerable benefit to Sino-US trade. They have initiated a welcome rally, and various organizations have discussed the welcome arrangements several times. It has now been decided to organize a reception office for the American Far East Commercial Inspection Delegation to take charge of everything. The office is actively preparing and will be formally established soon to start work. As for foreign companies, such as the British-American Tobacco Company, the Dollar Steamship Company, and the Shanghai Power Company, they are also making contacts and preparing to welcome them separately. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<p>The adoption of the metric ton system for ships has been agreed upon by the Jianghai Customs and the Ministry of Transportation, and will be implemented starting the first day of the [lunar] month. There are a total of six principles. The local [Shanghai] Maritime Bureau has already notified all merchants and crew members, stating briefly, "We have received Circular No. 49 from the Navigation Administration Bureau, which forwards Instruction No. 652 from the Ministry of Transportation. All ships should adopt the metric ton system in accordance with the Maritime Law. The Ministry of Industry has instructed the National Bureau of Weights and Measures to draft six principles, which should be implemented on a trial basis. It is hereby decided to implement them starting April 1st. The various principles, with annotations, are now issued for all crew members to follow." Attached is a copy of the six principles for the uniformity of navigation administration weights and measures as follows:</p>
<p>Six Principles</p>
<p>(1) The measurement of ships is limited to the use of meters, but private ships may use Chinese feet [市尺], provided that the equivalent in meters is also indicated. (Note: This Bureau is a state-run organization and should use meters as the standard. One meter is equivalent to 3.28 British/American feet, one British/American foot is equivalent to 0.3048 meters, and one meter is equivalent to three Chinese feet.) (2) The measurement of ship volume should follow the precedents of countries that have adopted the metric system, stipulating that 2.83 cubic meters is one ton, known as a volume ton. To calculate the volume tonnage of a ship, measure the length, width, and height of the ship in meters, multiply them together to obtain the cubic meters, and then divide by 2.83 to obtain the tonnage. Article 15 of Chapter 4 of the Ship Measurement Regulations, "Tonnage Calculation," is to be amended to read, "The volume of a ship is calculated with 2.83 cubic meters (equivalent to 100 cubic feet) as one volume ton. For ships whose capacity is expressed in piculs [擔], 0.283 cubic meters (equivalent to 10 cubic feet) is considered a 'volume picul.'" (Note: Ship volume tons are used to calculate the gross and net tonnage. Using 2.83 cubic meters as one volume ton is, in effect, equivalent to 100 cubic feet. However, the measurement should be based on the metric system. This section relates to the payment of tonnage dues to the Navigation Administration Bureau and this Bureau, and is usually not relevant to the duties of senior crew members.) (3) For goods transported by ships that are valued by weight, standard weight names should be used, such as metric tons, metric piculs, etc., or Chinese weight names, such as Chinese piculs, Chinese catties [斤], etc. For goods valued by volume, the space they occupy should be measured in cubic meters (equivalent to the number of cubic Chinese feet) or cubic Chinese feet (equivalent to the number of cubic meters). If necessary, 1.13 cubic meters may be used as a cargo volume ton. (Note: The cargo tonnage calculated by weight is what the English call "Dead-Weight Ton." The current standard of one metric ton is one thousand kilograms, equivalent to 2204.62 pounds in the English system. The cargo ton calculated by volume is what the English call "Measurement Ton." Using 1.13 cubic meters as a cargo volume ton is, in effect, equivalent to 40 cubic feet. However, the measurement should be based on the metric system.) (4) The distance used to calculate the price of a ship should be in kilometers or Chinese li [市里]. (Note: One kilometer is one thousand meters, equivalent to two Chinese li, or 0.62137 miles. This unit is different from nautical miles and is only used for calculating the price of a ship. It is not related to navigation. See item 5 below for how nautical miles are defined.) (5) The nautical mile used for ocean navigation should be 1852 meters, in accordance with international regulations (equivalent to 1.852 kilometers) (i.e., divide the Earth's meridian line, which is 360 degrees, into 60 minutes per degree, and take the distance of one minute as one nautical mile). (Note: The nautical mile still uses the distance of one minute of the Earth's meridian line as the standard, and there is no actual change from the English/American system of 6080 feet per nautical mile.) (6) The specification for ship pressure, originally using "pounds per square inch," should be changed to "kilograms per square centimeter," but the number of pounds may be noted for transitional purposes. (Note: "One pound per square inch" is equivalent to 0.07031 "kilograms per square centimeter" or 0.06804 "atmospheres." One "kilogram per square centimeter" is equivalent to 14.223 "pounds per square inch" or 0.9678 "atmospheres." One "atmosphere" is equivalent to 14.70 "pounds per square inch" or 1.0333 "kilograms per square centimeter.") If crew members still have any unclear points regarding the above principles and notes, they may inquire at the department at any time.</p>
<h3>Three Beihai-Shanghai Steamer "Hongzhen" Aground and Rescued</h3>
<p>Stranded at Zhishan below Yichang; "Yian" Steamer Tows and Rescues to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Three Beihai Company's Shanghai-bound steamer "Hongzhen" ran aground this Wednesday while traveling downstream from Yichang to Shanghai. The ship was fully loaded with cargo. It had first arrived in Hankou and was originally scheduled to depart from Hankou on the 22nd to return to Shanghai. However, after the ship departed from Yichang, it encountered fog and the river level dropped. Due to the negligence of the river pilot, the "Hongzhen" ran aground in the Zhishan area of the river, downstream from Yichang and upstream from Hankou. At the time, the ship was heavily laden with cargo and had a deep draft, causing it to become stuck in the shallows and impossible to free on its own. The owner of the "Hongzhen" immediately telegraphed the Yichang branch office to report the incident and request assistance. The Yichang branch office, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched the "Yian" steamer to the Zhishan river area to attempt to lighten the "Hongzhen" by offloading some of its cargo, and then to tow it free. Yesterday, this newspaper received a telegram stating that the "Hongzhen" had been towed free from the shallows by the "Yian" steamer and was now proceeding back to Shanghai. Whether the ship sustained any damage will be determined after it arrives in Shanghai and the cargo is unloaded.</p>
<h3>Chongqing-Kunming Route: Trial Flight from Shanghai Tomorrow; Post Office Announces Acceptance of Mail</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration announced yesterday that the China National Aviation Corporation's planned Chongqing-Kunming air route is scheduled to have a trial flight from Shanghai on the 25th of this month, via Ba County and Guiyang, to Kunming. Postal items intended to be carried by this flight to Guiyang and Kunming must be marked "To be carried by the Chongqing-Kunming trial flight." An additional airmail fee of 75 cents per 20 grams, or any fraction thereof, is required, and items must be delivered to the Shanghai Postal Administration or any of its branch offices for mailing on the 24th of this month. This announcement is hereby made for general information.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Returns to Shanghai Yesterday; Discusses Spring Relief Loans</h3>
<p>Government and Local Authorities to Each Bear Half; $200,000 Interest-Free Loans to Farmers</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Mr. Xu Jingren (Xu Shiying), Chairman of the National Relief Commission and Vice Chairman of the Famine Relief Association of Various Provinces, has returned to Shanghai by train at 11:35 p.m. the night before after reporting on the past year's relief efforts to the central government and seeking instructions on spring relief matters. Yesterday, he spoke to reporters from the Guowen News Agency, saying that regarding the interest-free loans for spring seeds, he had repeatedly consulted with President Wang, Minister Kong, and Mr. Ye Chucang, and decided that the government would allocate $200,000 for the purchase of seeds to be distributed to farmers in various disaster-stricken provinces. The provincial governments of each province will bear half of the cost. For example, Jiangsu Province will receive $20,000 from the National Relief Commission, plus $20,000 from the provincial government, for a total of $40,000 to purchase seeds to loan to farmers without interest, to be repaid after the autumn harvest. The number of funds allocated to each province and the method of lending will be determined at a regular meeting of the Standing Committee at Renji Hall at 4:00 p.m. on the 27th of this month (next Wednesday). The funds will generally be advanced by the Central Bank. As for the $600,000 in famine relief funds allocated by the central government to the provinces, $550,000 has already been received. Of the remaining $50,000, $5,000 has been directly allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the Nanjing Municipal Government, and the remaining $45,000 was to be collected from the Central Bank today (yesterday) and dispatched to the designated provinces. The winter emergency relief effort last year has now concluded. In addition, construction work on Huangshan Mountain has begun this year. More than 90 households have registered to claim state-owned land, and about 30 have reported. Fundraising efforts are underway to complete the original plan. He (Xu himself) is scheduled to go to Hangzhou on the 18th and then to Huangshan Mountain for inspection.</p>
<h3>Banque Industrielle de Chine's Request for Provisional Attachment on the Eastern Railway Wharf Rejected</h3>
<p>Deadline for Payment of Litigation Costs Expires</p>
<p>After the illegal sale of the Eastern Railway between Japan and Russia was concluded and a draft agreement was signed, the Shanghai branch of the Sino-French Industrial Bank filed a lawsuit requesting the Shanghai District Court to execute a provisional attachment. After receiving the complaint, the court, through Judge Yao Fuxiang, conducted a preliminary informal investigation. Because the notice was not served, no one from the defendant's side appeared in court. It was instructed to reschedule the hearing. As reported previously, after the court accepted the case, it ordered the payment of litigation costs. Since the deadline has now expired and payment has not been made, the case has been dismissed.</p>
<h3>Notable People's Movements</h3>
<p>Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai by overnight express train from Hangzhou yesterday at 5:40 p.m. and arrived in Shanghai around 11:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming arrived in Shanghai last night by train.</p>
<p>Zhang Xingkui arrived in Shanghai by car from Hangzhou yesterday.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Developer Discusses Circulating Notes; Proposes Reducing Issuance by 300 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed a real estate developer about the issue of issuing real estate circulating notes. According to the developer, the proposed issuance of circulating notes has been under consideration for a long time and has been discussed with the government beforehand. Since the total value of Shanghai real estate is 1.8 billion yuan, and assuming that 800 million yuan is held by foreign merchants, then the real estate owned by Chinese merchants is worth 1 billion yuan. Therefore, it would not be excessive to issue 500 million yuan in circulating notes, which is half the value. Even if some of the 1 billion yuan in real estate cannot be circulated due to other reasons, assuming that the amount of non-circulating assets is 400 million yuan, there would still be 600 million yuan in assets that could be circulated. Even if that 600 million yuan were calculated at half the value, 300 million yuan in circulating notes could still be issued. Furthermore, all of the real estate developers' deeds would be stored in the national treasury at the time of issuance. If a real estate developer were to experience personal issues, the government could confiscate all of their assets to compensate for the loss. Even if real estate were to gradually decline in value in the future, it would certainly not fall below half the value. Therefore, the issuance of circulating notes backed by real estate is more reliable than other empty guarantees. At a minimum, the real estate developers must insist on issuing 300 million yuan in circulating notes.</p>

<h3>On the Steamer "Xin Renhe", A Young Couple Commits Suicide by Jumping into the River; Despairing of the World Due to Marital Problems; The Owner Stopped the Ship to Rescue but it was Too Late</h3>
<p>The steamer "Xin Renhe," which travels between Chongming, Haimen, Qidong, and Shanghai, departed from Wharf No. 5 in southern Shanghai at 5:00 p.m. on the 21st of this month, bound for the ports of Haimen and Qidong. At 7:45 p.m., while passing the waters near the floating dock west of the Lion Mountain outside Wusongkou, passengers reported that a young man and woman simultaneously jumped into the river from the stern of the second-class deck and committed suicide. The owner immediately stopped the ship and turned around to attempt a rescue, which took 45 minutes. At that time, the tide was ebbing, the northeast wind was strong, and the current was swift, making rescue impossible. At the time, the steward Huang Can reported that around 4:00 p.m. that day, a young man and woman came aboard and booked cabin No. 4 on the third-class deck. When the ship passed Wusongkou, they ordered fried rice with eggs, boiled chicken, shrimp and pickled vegetable soup, and white wine from the steward. After the kitchen had prepared the food and brought it up, the two were nowhere to be found. While everyone was wondering what happened, they suddenly heard that a man and a woman had jumped into the river. The owner, together with the compradore and other crew members, inspected the cabin and found a suicide note written in pencil on a piece of antique copper paper on the table. They also found a handbag containing powder, some paper money and copper coins, and other items. It became clear that the young man and woman who jumped into the river from the stern of the second-class deck were the same two people who had booked cabin No. 4 on the third-class deck. Upon reading the contents of the suicide note, it was learned that the man's name was Gong Wu'gao (signed "Shi Shang"), from Huilong Town, Qidong, and the woman's name was Zhang Xueqing, from Ningbo. The reason for their suicide seemed to be marital problems. In addition to instructing Yang Xiqing, the director of the Antougang branch office, to notify their families, the remaining items and suicide notes were reported to the Navigation Administration Bureau for record-keeping. The suicide note is as follows:</p>
<p>Two Respectful Letters</p>
<p>Before Dear Parents: I humbly report that my unfilial crime is as heavy as the sky. I will repay your kindness of raising me in the next life. You both love your son as if he were a pearl in your palm. My suicide today is due to the coercion of my mother and elder sister, and the harshness of the environment. I hope you will not be sad, but think of me as having died from a sudden illness, or an early death in childhood. I have now seen through the ways of the world, and everything is an illusion, so I do not wish to live in this bustling world. I and Miss Xueqing are bound together by love and cannot be separated, so we are boarding a ship to seek death. We will live together in life, and die together in death. My words are not finished, but the end has come. I will say no more, but speak to you in my dreams. Your son Gong Shi Shang, your daughter-in-law Zhang Xueqing, prostrate themselves. (2) Before Dear Grandmother: I humbly report that since leaving Qidong for Chongming, I have suffered greatly. The other day, my mother colluded with my maternal grandmother to file a lawsuit, reported me to the public security authorities, and I was deported. I had no face to return home and did not want to live anymore. My suicide today is for no other reason than that I have seen through the ways of the world, so I do not wish to live in this world. Your grandson and granddaughter-in-law have now jumped into the sea together. Please do not be sad. I wish you all the best. Your grandson Gong Shi Shang, your granddaughter-in-law Zhang Xueqing, prostrate themselves.</p>
<p>Letter to the Reporter: Dear Reporter, I want to trouble you. Please publish the following paragraph in the newspaper: "The reason for our death, due to our inseparable love, is entirely due to the coercion of our mother and elder sister in the family. They wanted to force us apart, and we could not bear to separate, so we came to Shanghai to jump into the river." Today, we drank our farewell wine at the Great China Restaurant, and then watched a play at the Golden Theater. The woman is from Ningbo, 25 years old, named Zhang Xueqing. The man is from Qidong, 20 years old, named Gong Minggao. I also hope that the following poems will be published. Written jointly by the man and woman:</p>
<p>Three Farewell Poems</p>
<p>(1) Leaving the world to say goodbye to Shanghai, only for you, abandoning my white hair and burdening you again. We have enjoyed sorrow and joy together in life, and we will sink together in the vast sea. (2) Holding a pen, I write a poem with great enthusiasm, the words in the poem are extraordinary. I regret that my Xiao Xiang [a river in Hunan] has no shadows of flowers, and is also in the spring flowing in the drizzle. (3) I was born in Tangjia Village, Si Jing [near Shanghai], my father is in prison in Chongcheng. The woman lives with her mother, enjoying freedom in the countryside.</p>
<h3>A Rogue, Utterly Desperate and Bored, Impersonates a Landlord to Defraud</h3>
<p>Using Someone Else's House as His Own; Claims to Reduce Rent to Deceive and Obtain Rental Income</p>
<p>There are two houses with old addresses No. 18 and No. 20, at Rue Ratard and Rue Albert, French Concession, now renumbered by the Municipal Council as No. 56 and No. 58. They are the property of Hongyu Real Estate Company. They were previously rented to Hengxingxiang Foreign Goods Store. Recently, due to poor market conditions, the store went bankrupt and returned the property, which has been vacant. A "For Rent" notice has been posted on the door. However, a rogue named Wang Wentai (33 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 3, Ronghua Lane, Old West Gate), desperate and bored, had the outlandish idea of posing as the owner of the house and spreading the word that he was reducing the rent to attract renters. Liu Jinkang, a Suzhou native who runs a butcher shop at No. 393, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, was planning to find a house to open a business and heard this news. He contacted Wang on the 6th of this month to rent the two houses, agreeing on a monthly rent of 147 yuan, including small repairs. He paid a deposit of 10 yuan and agreed to sign a lease. However, Wang could not wait and sent a letter urging Liu to pay the rent quickly, otherwise someone else would rent the house before him. After receiving the letter, Liu paid Wang 200 yuan in rent on the 10th of the same month. Wang issued a receipt from the "Hengji Company Rental Office" for the fourth month of the 24th year [of the Republic, 1935] to Liu as proof of renting the house. Liu immediately hired workers to renovate the storefront on the following day. On the 13th, Hongyu Real Estate Company, the real owner of the house, found out and stopped Liu from renovating. Only then did Liu realize that he had been deceived. He sought out Wang Wentai to argue and demand the return of his money, but Wang had already disappeared. Liu reported the incident to the French police and requested an investigation. It turns out that after Wang Wentai received the money from Liu, he used the same method to rent the two houses to three Suzhou natives living at No. 6, Ren Zhi Lane, Mofang Street: Gao Quansheng, Xu Yunqing, and Xia Keming, to open a game meat store. They had agreed on a monthly rent of 125 yuan, a tip of 100 yuan, and an opening fee of 10 yuan. They were scheduled to pay the rent and tip at the Qunleju teahouse at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Zhengjia Bridge Street at 10:00 a.m. the day before (the 21st) to sign a lease. While the two sides were negotiating, Liu Jinkang, who had been previously deceived, found out and reported it to the Mailand Station police. Detective Li Baochang accompanied Liu to the Qunleju teahouse, arrested Wang Wentai, and brought him and Gao, Xu, and Xia to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, Gao, Xu, and Xia also told the police that Wang had attempted to defraud them and requested an investigation. The police chief ordered Wang to be detained and sent to the Second Special District Court yesterday. Judge Qiu Huan-ying presided over the Eighth Criminal Court for the trial. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahong stated the case, saying that the defendant was arrested for fraudulently obtaining property and requested a postponement so that the police could thoroughly investigate the case before formally prosecuting. Liu Jinkang, the plaintiff, then recounted his experience of being deceived and said that Jiang Afu was present and witnessed the payment. When questioning the defendant Wang Wentai, Wang denied that he was employed by Hongyu Real Estate Company and denied deceiving Liu, claiming that he had been falsely accused. The court adjourned the hearing to the 26th and ordered the defendant to be remanded and the plaintiff to bring his witness to court for questioning at the next hearing.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers Are Outrageously Rude and Scold the Judge; Retrial of the Kidnapping of Wei Tingrong; Kidnapper Zhu Jingcheng Shouts That He Would Rather Be Shot</h3>
<p>Wei Tingrong, the former commander of the French Concession Chinese Volunteer Corps, director of the French Municipal Council's Chinese Affairs Committee, manager of the Sino-French Bank, and a native of Ningbo, was kidnapped on Zhubao Road at noon on July 24, 1929. After the French police rescued him, they arrested the gang members Zhu Jincheng, i.e., Zhu Jingcheng (also known as Xiangfeng, 37 years old, from Huaining, Anhui, formerly employed by the Anhui Department of Finance and the Jiangsu Water Police Department), Chen Zhongheng (also known as Chen Wangkui, 35 years old, from Wenzhou, Zhejiang), and Tang Shiliang (36 years old, from Songjiang). The French police sent them to the former French Concession Court, which sentenced them to five years of imprisonment each, to be handed over to the mainland government for trial after serving their sentences. Now that the five-year sentences of Zhu and the other two have expired, and because the French Concession Court has been taken back and the Chinese courts and prisons have been established, the Second Special District Prison has transferred Zhu and the other two to the Second Special District Court to be reviewed. Judge Qiu Huan-ying has held two hearings and has also transferred the files of the gang members Lü Ruowang and Li Weicai, who have already been sentenced to life imprisonment, for verification. Zhu and the others have denied being involved in the kidnapping and have hired lawyers to defend themselves. The debate has concluded, and a date has been set for sentencing. This has been previously reported. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. Judge Qiu presided over the Eighth Criminal Court and ordered the three defendants to be brought before the court. After briefly questioning their names and birthplaces, he announced the verdict: Zhu Jincheng, for instigating kidnapping for ransom, is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Chen Zhongheng and Tang Shiliang, for assisting in kidnapping for ransom, are each sentenced to six years of imprisonment. The number of days they have been in prison will be counted as time served. After the verdict, the judge briefly explained the reasons for the verdict to Zhu and the others. Zhu showed an arrogant attitude and asked the court, "How much time do I have left? Has the one-third reduction in sentence been deducted? My case is really unfair. Please (referring to the judge) have mercy." The judge said that kidnapping should originally be punishable by death, and that reducing the sentence to seven years of imprisonment was already very lenient. If he was not satisfied, he could appeal to the High Third Branch Court after receiving the judgment. At this point, Zhu glared and shouted, "I am not satisfied! I would rather be shot!" and cursed the judge for an unfair verdict. The court, hearing this, was greatly angered and ordered the bailiffs to take him down to be sent to the prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution. As Zhu was being taken down by the police, he continued to curse. However, Chen and Tang remained silent and showed a pitiful state of fear.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Announcement; Prohibiting the Reception of Gods and Religious Processions</h3>
<p>Wasting Money and Harming Public Order; Vigorously Promoting the New Life Movement and Eliminating Superstition</p>
<p>Cai Jingjun, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, issued a special order to all branch bureaus and police stations yesterday to comply with the prohibition of the evil practice of receiving gods and religious processions, and issued a notice stating, "The reception of gods and religious processions disrupts the law and order, and has been repeatedly prohibited by announcements. According to reports, there have been incidents of raising gods and holding processions in Yangjing Town and Tangqiao during the Qingming Festival this year, which is completely inappropriate. It must be understood that such actions not only waste money and manpower, but also create opportunities for local ruffians to extort money and cause trouble, which greatly harms public order. At a time when the New Life Movement is being vigorously promoted, there should be no promotion of such superstitious practices. The ban should be reiterated to maintain public order. In addition to ordering subordinates to strictly prohibit it, this announcement is hereby made for general information. All must comply and must not deliberately violate it."</p>
<h3>Dancer's Abortion Case; Midwife Found Guilty and Sentenced</h3>
<p>Sentenced to One Year and Six Months of Imprisonment, Suspended for Three Years; Chen Weida Proves No Involvement with Documents</p>
<p>Bao Huiying, a dancer at the La Dahua Dance Hall, became pregnant recently as a result of a physical relationship with a customer. The pregnancy had reached three months, and her abdomen was gradually expanding. As she made her living by dancing, a large abdomen would be unsightly and would greatly affect her work. She learned that Liu Wangshi, a midwife residing at No. 723, Jiujiang Road, was accustomed to performing abortions. On the 4th of this month, she went to Liu Wangshi's place and begged her to perform an abortion. Although the fetus was aborted, the dancer's internal organs were damaged. Her father, Bao Zhenyuan, sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment at 4:00 p.m. on the 11th, but she died of her injuries at 6:00 p.m. that night. After the incident, the local police station reported the matter to the hospital. Detective Wu Changkai investigated and, in addition to reporting the case to the authorities to inspect the body and order its burial, police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a public prosecution against the midwife Liu Wangshi. The First Special District Court held two hearings. Because the deceased Bao Huiying was short of funds after the abortion, she wrote a letter to Chen Weida, the owner of the Weida Hotel, a native of Nanhui, on March 8, asking for a loan. It was instructed to summon Chen to court for questioning. As reported previously, yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye resumed the trial of the defendant Liu Wangshi. Chen Weida and Bao Zhenyuan, the father of the deceased, appeared in court one after the other. Chen detailed the circumstances of the deceased's request for a loan in her letter, saying that he occasionally visited dance halls for social interaction with friends and had danced with the deceased. He only knew that they shared the same surname Bao, but he did not know her name. He had only met her in the dance hall and there was no further relationship. He had not seen her recently and had no impression of her in his mind. However, on the night of March 8, he suddenly received a letter delivered by a postman. When he opened it, he realized that it was from the dancer, asking to borrow dozens of yuan to meet an urgent need. He thought it was a common request for help and set it aside. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 11th, a police detective came to investigate, and he learned that the dancer had died from an abortion. Her father, Bao Zhenyuan, had even claimed at the police station that he had instigated the abortion, which was extremely absurd. Therefore, he immediately brought the letter he had received to the police station, where the police chief carefully examined it and determined that he had no connection with the abortion. With the truth clarified, Bao Zhenyuan begged him to give him some financial assistance because of his poverty. Originally, helping the poor and providing emergency relief was something that should be done, but if he had given him assistance at that time, he would have given others a reason to criticize him. Therefore, he refused to accommodate him. He then submitted the deceased's original letter to the court. After Judge Qian examined the letter, he stated that it was entirely a request for a loan from beginning to end, and that the beginning stated that they had not met for a long time, which proved that Bao's previous statement that his daughter had spoken to Chen on the phone on March 6 was unreliable. He then questioned Bao and the defendant Liu Wangshi. After the police lawyer concluded the debate, Judge Qian announced the verdict: Liu Wangshi, intending to make a profit, was entrusted by a pregnant woman to perform an abortion, resulting in death, is sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, suspended for three years. As Chen Weida was only in the position of a witness, the court ordered him to leave after his testimony.</p>
<h3>Chu Youliang Fraudulently Obtains Milk Money; Two Church Members Deceive the Priest; Furthermore, He Entices a Young Girl to Impersonate for Fraudulent Gain</h3>
<p>Chu Yougen, a local resident residing at No. 11 Yugeng Lane, north of Meilong Town, Shanghai West (nicknamed "Little Limp"), is thirty years old, does not engage in legitimate work, and specializes in wandering aimlessly. Five years ago, he joined the Catholic Church in Xujiahui as a church member. The priest, considering his poverty, recommended him to work as a handyman in the Sacred Heart Hospital. In January of the 21st year of the Republic of China, Yougen took a baby girl who had been sheltered in the church for several months and ostensibly introduced her for milk feeding in the countryside (i.e., foster care) at three yuan per month, supplied by the church. In reality, Yougen sold the child to a neighboring woman named Chu (also known as Chu Ahu) in Dongyugeng Lane as an adopted daughter, obtaining six yuan. However, the child died of illness in June of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Yougen concealed the report, and the milk money was still collected monthly. By January of this year, it had been three full years. According to the rules, the girl should be returned to the church, and he was repeatedly urged. Yougen made excuses to delay. At the end of last month, he had a strange idea. He tricked a three-year-old girl named A'mei, the daughter of his paternal uncle Chu Hegen, to the church in Xujiahui, claiming that each person could receive a reward of two yuan for vaccination. Hegen believed it to be true, so he entrusted Yougen to take the girl to Xujiahui for vaccination. Unexpectedly, Yougen left and never returned. Hegen's wife, Zhu, rushed to the Catholic Church the day before yesterday to inquire, only to find out that Yougen had used A'mei as the girl for milk feeding and received a reward of twelve yuan before fleeing without a trace. The priest of the church, upon learning of the previous situation, was greatly angered and has now reported to the Public Security Bureau and the British and French Concessions police to investigate and deal with it.</p>
<h3>Husband Dies Five Days After Wedding</h3>
<p>Widow Sues Father-in-Law for Alimony; Settlement Reached in Court</p>
<p>Peng Pinzhen, a woman from Songjiang, is twenty-two years old and a junior in high school at Aiguo Girls' School. She previously developed a romantic relationship with Gu Dicen, the son of Gu Hongxiang, a Jiaxing native residing at No. 8 Yuxiang Lane, Xiafei Road, French Concession, through friendship. Dicen is older than her by one year and has also received higher education. The engagement was arranged through matchmakers Zhang Yuquan and Gong Jingxiang. In September of last year, Dicen suddenly suffered from severe sleeping sickness. However, Miss Peng's love for Gu was profound. She deeply believed in the old custom that getting married during illness could bring about a turn for the better. Therefore, she had both families prepare for the wedding and carry it out. Unexpectedly, Gu Dicen died five days after the wedding, abandoning his beloved wife. Peng Pinzhen, having lost her husband at a young age, felt infinite pain in her spirit and was determined to remain chaste. Recently, she wanted to go abroad to study, hoping to gain profound knowledge in order to establish herself and make a living in the future. However, she could not obtain the understanding of her parents-in-law. Therefore, Peng Pinzhen hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court, requesting a judgment ordering her father-in-law, Gu Hongxiang, to pay a lump sum of four thousand four hundred yuan for alimony, and to return her dowry. Based on the complaint, the court, through Judge Li Liang, summoned the plaintiff Peng Pinzhen and her lawyer to the court once to state the purpose of the request for judgment. The defendant, Gu Hongxiang, appeared in court through a lawyer and stated that the defendant only had one son, who unfortunately died early, causing him immense heartache. If his daughter-in-law could remain chaste, he, as an elder, would be able to find some comfort. However, the defendant did not agree with the plaintiff remaining chaste outside. If the defendant could study at home, the defendant could hire a teacher to teach her and did not want the plaintiff to go abroad to study. As for the plaintiff's request for living expenses, the bride's family had sixty acres of fertile land as dowry, which would not be a problem for the plaintiff's future life. The current lawsuit has other intentions. The court adjourned the hearing to summon the defendant again for questioning. Yesterday, it was time for the continued hearing. Both parties appeared in court with their lawyers and were still heard by Judge Li in the Civil Court No. 7. First, the plaintiff stated the purpose of the lawsuit, as before, requesting monthly living expenses of thirty yuan. The defendant stated that he was unable to bear the large amount of living expenses requested by the plaintiff because the property had already been mortgaged. At most, he could only afford to pay ten yuan per month for the plaintiff's living expenses. The official then summoned the two matchmakers, Zhang and Gong, for questioning and persuaded them to reconcile, asking both parties to compromise. The plaintiff then reduced the amount by five yuan, requesting at least twenty-five yuan per month. The defendant increased the amount by five yuan to fifteen yuan. After the court persuaded the defendant to pay twenty yuan per month, the plaintiff stated that it was not enough. After consultation between the lawyers of both parties, the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff twenty-two yuan per month. With the plaintiff's permission, both parties reached a settlement in court, signed the minutes, and withdrew.</p>

<h3>Firefighter Dies in the Line of Duty; Zhou Xitang's Funeral Today</h3>
<p>All City Firefighters Participate in the Funeral Procession; Coffin to be Transported to Pudong for Burial</p>
<p>Zhou Xitang, a local resident, is thirty-three years old. In September of the 17th year of the Republic of China, he joined the Nanshi Hezangbang Second District Fire Brigade as a volunteer firefighter. He was enthusiastic about rescue work and spared no effort. Zhou, at around 10 p.m. the night before last, due to a fire at the Tongchang Oil Press Factory at No. 58 Jichang Street in Nanshi, rode on the fire truck of the brigade to put out the fire. Unexpectedly, while passing through Xiaodongmen Street, the truck was traveling too fast, causing the vehicle to shake. As a result, Zhou, who was standing beside the truck, lost his footing and fell to the ground. He was sent to the nearby Nanyang Hospital by his colleagues, but ultimately succumbed to his injuries. Yesterday, it was learned that the body would be moved to the auditorium of the Second District Fire Brigade on Zihua Street in Nanshi, and the funeral would be held at noon today. In addition to presenting wreaths and elegiac couplets, the fire brigades of all districts in the Public Concession and the French Concession will all participate in the funeral procession. It is said that the coffin will be transported from Dongjiadu to Shangnan Wharf and then to Pudong for burial.</p>
<h3>Jurisdiction Transferred; Debate Concluded in the Songhui Arson Case</h3>
<p>Yin Shisheng, the former director of the Suzhou Public Security Bureau, opened the Songhui Amusement Park next to the Songhui Motor Road in his native Songjiang last summer. On July 15th and 16th, it was suddenly burned down. Yin Shisheng believed that Li Ruizhi and Yao Chongfu of the fire brigade in the area were involved. Based on the situation, he sued the Songjiang County Court and requested the Jiangsu High Court to transfer jurisdiction, designating the Shanghai District Court to handle the case. Prosecutor Kong Xianglin investigated and clarified the facts, ordering the two defendants, Li and Yao, to each pay a written surety of five hundred yuan to be released on bail pending further instructions. On one hand, they were prosecuted in the Criminal Court for offenses such as disrupting order, endangering public safety, and damaging public property. On the other hand, Yin Shisheng also filed an incidental private lawsuit, requesting compensation for losses of 18,477.66 yuan. Judge Shao Qinzhi held two public hearings, but the case was not concluded due to its complexity. Details were previously reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the case was continued yesterday morning at 10 a.m. by Judge Shao. The plaintiff, Yin Shisheng, accompanied by his private lawsuit lawyer Cao Shouji, appeared in court to request the pursuit of the private lawsuit. The defendants, Li Ruizhi and Yao Chongfu, accompanied by their hired lawyers Jin Xiongbai, Yu Chuanding, Zhang Gugui, and Gu Changyuan, also attended the court one after another. After the interrogating official briefly questioned the two defendants, he ordered the debate to begin. The defendants' lawyers rose one after another to defend the defendants for a long time, mainly arguing that the two defendants did not incite the crowd to destroy the park. Moreover, they were doing things for the local public interest and would never do such a thing. Furthermore, the witnesses presented by the plaintiff, such as Inspector Wu Xisheng's report, stated that due to the large number of people (more than 10,000 people), it was difficult to identify the perpetrators, completely hoping to shift the blame to the fire brigade. The facts are clear. They requested that they be declared not guilty. The plaintiff stated that the people's houses, bedclothes, boxes, furniture, and other items were burned down, which was clearly witnessed by the patrolling officer Wu Xisheng (patrol leader Wu Qingzhen, etc., provided clear evidence in the investigation). The defendants should be held liable for the losses suffered by the people. After obtaining the testimony, the interrogating official ordered the debate to be concluded and scheduled the judgment to be pronounced at 2 p.m. on the 30th of this month. Each of the two defendants was given an additional surety of 2,000 yuan to be released on bail pending further instructions.</p>

<h3>Killed for a Boiler; Wang Wenyao's Skull Smashed and Killed</h3>
<p>Wang Zuoju and His Gang Commit Murder; Men and Women Sent for Investigation</p>
<p>Jiang Laoba, the owner of a boiler shop at No. 208 Longhua Road, previously leased the boiler shop to Wang Zuoju for business because he did not intend to operate it. Recently, the lease term expired, and Jiang took back the shop and leased it to Wang Wenyao from Nanjing. As a result, Wang Zuoju was unemployed and had nothing to do. He suspected that Wang Wenyao was the one who caused trouble, so Jiang Laoba refused to extend the lease. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, and the desire to kill arose in his heart. So, at around 7 p.m. on the 21st of this month, he gathered his nephew Wang Xiaoshand and others, including Fei Dequan, Wang Zhenbiao, Xu Dejin, and Tang Xiaowuzi, carrying axes and wooden sticks, and rushed to Wang Wenyao's house. Without asking any questions, they started to commit violence. Axes and sticks were wielded at the same time. Wang Wenyao was outnumbered, and his head was injured in three places by the axe. Bleeding profusely, he fell to the ground. When they saw that their goal had been achieved, they dispersed in a rush. Wang's wife, Yang, sent her husband to Shanghai Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police station in charge, who sent police to arrest Wang Zuoju, Fei Dejin, and Wang Zhenbiao's wife, Wang Zhang, and three other men and women to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation and detention. Unexpectedly, Wang Wenyao, who was injured, could not be saved due to brain damage. His condition worsened the night before last, and his breath was weak. He died soon after. Yesterday morning, the local bailiff Gu Xueyuan, accompanied by the widow Wang Yang, reported the death to the District Court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia, commissioned by the court, and coroner Xuan Zhiming, etc., arrived at the court to examine the body. It was determined that the deceased Wang Wenyao died from his injuries. The death certificate was filled out, and the family members were ordered to prepare the coffin and wait for the police to send the criminals to court for interrogation and legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Car Crushes Skull; Yin Hongfa Loses His Life</h3>
<p>Yin Hongfa (25 years old), a resident of a shack in Jinling Road, Zhabei, made a meager living by pulling a rickshaw. At around 9 a.m. yesterday, Yin was walking along Jinling Road near the entrance of Dongyeli when a car with license plate number 13461 suddenly sped from behind. Yin was unable to avoid it and was knocked down immediately. His skull was crushed by the car's wheels, and the blood and flesh were blurred, a tragic sight to behold. The police station in charge ordered the local bailiff Li Ruiru to report the incident to the District Court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia and coroner Xuan Zhiming, etc., arrived at the scene to verify the death and ordered the family members to prepare the coffin and wait for further instructions.</p>
<h3>Male and Female Bandits Commit Multiple Crimes</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the Yulin Road Police Station previously arrested a group of bandits including Yang Jinlong, Jiang Jinlian, Yu Yongsheng, Hu Fu, Dai Yonglin, Huang Hancheng, and the woman Wang Sanmei. An investigation revealed that the group had committed multiple crimes: (1) Twice attempted to rob Chen Shuitang's property at No. 199 Baoqing Lane, No. 247 Qipu Road, between February 25 and 11:10 a.m. on March 6. (2) Robbed Weng Zi'an of clothing and silver worth 128 yuan at No. 941 Qiqihar Road at 8 p.m. on January 2. (3) Gang-robbed gold and silver ornaments worth more than 10,000 yuan from the Taihengyuan Silver Furnace at Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, on January 30 of last year. They were escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Wu Hanhan held a trial in the Third Criminal Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan detailed the course of events, and stated that the Taihengyuan Silver Furnace on Beijing Road had long since moved and ceased operations, and the victim could not be found. However, the defendant Hu Fu was an employee of the store at the time. He instigated Dai Yonglin and Zhang Maosong, Gu Jingui, and Laoqi, who had been identified, to go to rob the store together. At that time, the offender confessed that Dai was the leader and a wanted warrant had been issued. Subsequently, the victim Weng Zi'an of Qiqihar Road testified, questioning the two defendants Hu and Dai. Regarding the Beijing Road Taihengyuan robbery case, they admitted that they had received only a few hundred yuan afterwards. Hu denied instigating the robbery, and Dai also denied being the leader. Their statements were evasive. The five male and female defendants, including Yang Jinlong, gave the same testimony as before. Judge Wu ordered them to be remanded to custody separately under the direction of a lawyer appointed to defend the defendants pro bono, pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Aird &amp; Near Road; Robbery Arrested and Detained Pending Investigation and Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>Chen Rongxing, a Suzhou native who works at the North Railway Station, lives at No. 21 Deshou Lane, No. 488 Aird &amp; Near Road. At 7:40 p.m. the night before last, five bandits suddenly broke into Chen's house with weapons. They threatened the men and women in the house with guns, driving them into a room and monitoring their actions. Then, they ransacked the house, robbing more than a hundred yuan in cash and valuables such as clothing, worth a total of 209 yuan, and fled with the stolen goods. The victims chased after them and shouted for help. Western constable No. 117 and Chinese constables No. 1122 and No. 1244 heard the alarm and helped chase after the robbers. At Knigan Road, one of the bandits, Zhang Musheng from Pudong, was caught. A pistol and four bullets were seized from him, and a stolen coat discarded by the gang was recovered. Zhang was taken to the Huishi Police Station. Under interrogation by Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Detective Shen Dehui, and Western Detective Gibson, Zhang confessed to the robbery. He said that the incident was initiated by Pan A'xiao from Suzhou. Since Pan and the victim Chen Rongxing were relatives, he invited Laoqiang, Chen A'da, and Xiao Renfa, who were at large, to discuss the matter in Room 126 of the Qinghe Inn on Zhejiang Road yesterday, and then went to rob. Pan A'xiao was on lookout at the opposite alley. The Chinese and Western detectives led Zhang Musheng to Rongshou Lane on Guizhou Road and arrested Pan A'xiao. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Provisional Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case and prosecuted them for robbery in accordance with Article 348 of the Criminal Law. However, since the accomplices were still at large, he requested an extension. Subsequently, the victim Chen Rongxing, accompanied by witnesses Hua Jianghu and Lü Shuigen, testified about the robbery and identified Zhang Musheng in court as the one who held a gun and forbade them to make noise at the time. After Wu Tingqi, the presiding judge, briefly questioned the two defendants, he ordered them to be remanded to custody pending further investigation and interrogation in seven days.</p>

<h3>National Match Industry Association Submits Urgent Plea to Ministry of Finance Again for Relief</h3>
<p>Match Industry Faces Perilous Situation, Imminent Collapse, Relief Urgently Requested to Alleviate Merchants' Hardships</p>
<p>The All-China Match Manufacturers' Association, previously due to falling market prices and declining business, submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance for relief. However, no concrete measures have been taken to date. Yesterday, the Association submitted another petition to the Ministry of Finance appealing for relief. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>We, the association, reported in July of last year that the industry unanimously agreed that overproduction, business decline, and the sudden imposition of heavy taxes, made it increasingly difficult to prevent illicit leakage. The situation became increasingly perilous, and we requested that you forward our request and devise methods of relief. We thoroughly explained the reasons for the overproduction of matches and the difficulty of preventing illicit leakage. We also enclosed the "National Match Control Outline" and the "Match Joint Business Outline" approved by the Second Session of the Second Executive Committee of our association on December 10th of the previous year, together with various attachments, and submitted them to your ministry, requesting that you adopt and implement them to provide relief. Subsequently, we received document number 195 which stated that the submitted document and attachments had been received, and that the National Economic Council had been consulted for investigation and handling, and that we should be informed. After receiving this reply, our colleagues were overjoyed, believing that the fate of the match industry rested on this single opportunity, and eagerly awaited the realization of the control measures. However, many days have passed without any news. On the other hand, illicit leakage of matches has become increasingly active since the tax increase. Tax-paying matches are being heavily encroached upon, resulting in a narrower business scope, a deeper degree of overproduction, an imbalance between supply and demand, and more intense competition among our colleagues. Selling prices are gradually falling, costs can no longer be covered, high taxes cannot be passed on, and losses are increasing daily. The perilous situation is unprecedented, and we are barely clinging to life, facing imminent demise. Although our colleagues and the association have submitted reports to the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Affairs Department to order all bureaus to strictly crack down on illicit leakage, the great profits involved have attracted petty criminals who risk circumventing the law or taking advantage of loopholes. Various cunning schemes are being employed, which cannot be effectively addressed by ordinary anti-smuggling measures. If alternative relief measures are not sought, the trend of tax evasion will inevitably intensify. Not only will the match industry, which has been painstakingly developed for decades, be unable to survive due to the numerous obstacles, but also the various tax revenues of the country will be significantly affected. We believe that the preservation of industry to save the nation is the instruction left by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. However, when we consider the so-called emerging industries in our country, their lifelines are mostly controlled by foreigners. The match industry is one of the few industries that is 80% or 90% operated by Chinese people. This last remaining fruit of Chinese industry should be promptly assisted, otherwise its total destruction will deter Chinese people from investing in other enterprises and cause them to hesitate. Industry is linked to tax revenue. Assisting existing industries to maintain tax revenue is the best way to promote future industries and open up new tax sources. The matter is straightforward, and the principle is clear. Today, the match industry faces a perilous situation, with the constant threat of collapse. Providing relief as soon as possible still offers hope for survival. Delay will render even relief efforts futile. In the past, Bian Que told Duke Huan of Qi that if a disease is not treated when it is in the hair, it will penetrate deeper. The current condition of the match industry has progressed from the hair to the flesh, and is about to spread to the heart. The crisis is imminent, and we are on the verge of death. As a group representing this industry, and for the sake of the survival of our colleagues, we cannot but fulfill our responsibility to advocate and appeal. Your ministry, for the sake of national tax revenue and the future of industry in our country, will surely not stand idly by. We dare not hesitate to submit this urgent appeal. We earnestly implore your ministry to consider Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions to save the nation, to consider the precarious state of the match industry, and to promptly devise relief measures to alleviate the hardships of merchants and protect the foundation of the nation. We await your instructions with utmost urgency.</p>

<p>To Collect Historical Relics of Confucianism</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, since the Association for Respecting Confucius and Saving the Nation on Lafayette Road in this city began soliciting members, those who have come to join have been very enthusiastic. The Association believes that Confucian scholars from all over have sent letters requesting to join or organize branches to expand the promotion of Confucianism. It is urgent to dispatch personnel to contact them. Therefore, Preparatory Committee Member Mr. Ye Zhengjing has been dispatched to discuss the matter. The latest news on the Association's affairs is recorded as follows:</p>

On his way back to Pingnan, he will stop briefly in Qufu to collect historical relics of Confucianism in order to promote it.</p>
<p>Opening Classes and Giving Lectures: According to the responsible committee member Cheng, our Association has been preparing for more than two months. Because the preparations for the Association have not yet matured, a formal establishment meeting has not been held. However, as there are already many Confucian scholars who have joined the Association, it is planned to establish lecture classes and give lectures to carry out the initial work of promoting Confucianism. Therefore, the Association is actively hiring lecturers and preparing to open classes.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>I recently read your newspaper's fourth page, thirteenth edition, which contained an article titled "Firefighter Dies in the Line of Duty." The content does not align with the facts. Upon investigation, the fire originated in a corner of the Tongchang Yarn Factory workshop, adjacent to our factory, not within our premises. When the fire started, our factory promptly used its own firefighting equipment to extinguish it. By the time the fire brigade arrived, the fire was already put out. Only a few dozen cotton yarn cones were burned; the building's bricks and tiles sustained no damage. Fearing external misunderstandings, we are writing to request a correction. To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office. Respectfully, Shunyu Factory, March 23rd. Additionally, according to a statement from the person involved, Huang Youbin, yesterday's Shen Bao published a news item about the owner of the Longshun Shipyard, Huang Youbin, being accused of abandonment. The content does not align with the facts, and we request that a letter be sent for correction to avoid confusion. Therefore, we urgently send this letter, hoping for a correction and acknowledging your public service. To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, Lawyer Peng Xuehai, March 23rd.</p>

<p>B. Domestic Economic Overview: During the initial two years of the global economic depression, China's situation differed significantly from other countries, experiencing relatively minimal impact. China was fortunate to avoid the worst of the crisis temporarily because it operated on a silver standard. The ratio of silver to gold depreciated at a rate equal to or exceeding the depreciation of commodity prices calculated in gold. As a result, Chinese commodity prices sometimes remained constant or even increased due to the low silver price. Foreign trade was more profitable due to the gold price. Although reduced foreign purchasing power led to a slight decline in export trade, it was not as severe as in other countries. Domestic industries were also able to maintain a normal level of activity. Therefore, the gradual decline in the price of silver during those two years greatly benefited China. However, starting in September 1931, countries such as Britain, Japan, and the United States successively abandoned the gold standard. China's currency gradually appreciated due to these changes, and China also began to fall into the economic difficulties experienced by other countries. In this year, the country was plagued by floods and droughts, and affected by the United States' silver policy. The malaise of the rural areas deepened, and the industry and commerce of the cities declined. The purchasing power of the general public decreased. Our country's economic problems are increasingly watched by all parties.</p>
<p>(1) Finance: This year, China's financial situation showed an unusual phenomenon, namely the large export of silver, the low deposit reserve of foreign banks in Shanghai, and the insignificant decrease in the deposit reserve of Chinese banks. First, the situation of silver import and export is listed in the following table: (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Datong University Adds a Physical Education Department</h3>
<p>Datong University's physical education facilities have always been known for their completeness. In recent years, it has vigorously implemented popular physical education and has actively expanded. The area of the sports field reaches more than 80 acres, which is especially rare. There is also a river of more than 60 acres in the school. The river water is clear and can be used for swimming and boating. The school's directors, He Yingqin, Chu Minyi, and Wu Tiecheng, are all very enthusiastic about promoting physical education. Therefore, at the spring board meeting this year, it was proposed to add a physical education department. It was unanimously approved by all the directors, and Wang Boqun, the president of the school, hired the current director of physical education at the school, Fang Wanbang, a Master of Physical Education from Columbia University in the United States, who has served as a physical education professor at Beijing Normal University, Anhui University, National Central University, and Zhejiang University, as the director. Mr. Fang carefully planned and formulated the curriculum, and decided to start it in the autumn, recruiting high school graduates, and giving them two years of specialized physical education knowledge and skills. Men and women will be trained in separate classes, in order to cultivate appropriate physical education teachers for primary and secondary schools, physical education administrators, and scout leaders. The school's College of Education has a long-standing reputation, and the science department is also very well-equipped. Students of the physical education department can study courses related to physical education at the same time as students in the university department, such as the principles of education, educational administration, teaching methods, psychology, physiology, and hygiene. All the excellent facilities and teaching materials in the school can be used as much as possible, which is a rare opportunity.</p>

<h3>Japanese Police Bureau Decides to Adopt Confucian and Mencian Teachings as Educational Policy</h3>
<p>Does Japan really respect the teachings of Confucius and Mencius?</p>
<p>The World News Agency said, according to the Dongbao report, the Police Bureau under the Ministry of Interior has now decided to implement a new educational policy for all police schools in the country, that is, to use the teachings of Confucius and Mencius as the basic education, in order to promote the Eastern way of governing the country and bringing peace to the world. On the one hand, the original courses in international law and other laws will be completely abolished or reduced, because these subjects are considered to be of little use to future police maintenance. It is found that the intention of this policy change of the Police Bureau is to focus on cultivating the moral heart of police officers, and regards knowledge as secondary. This new policy will be implemented from April 1, and the bureau will also compile and print a periodical to clarify the purpose of this, in order to control all 63,000 active police officers in the country with this new policy.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Branch of the Cultural Construction Association Appoints Secretary-General</h3>

<h3>Chen Heqin's Talk on Phonetic Notation of Chinese Characters</h3>
<p>This newspaper reported on the 13th of this month that Li Jinxi responded to Shu Xincheng's discussion on casting copper molds for phonetic notation of Chinese characters. Educator Chen Heqin expressed his opinion on this matter, stating briefly that the language in the newspaper was not detailed. However, after examining the wording, it seems that he does not advocate replacing Chinese characters with phonetic symbols, but rather proposes using symbols to indicate the correct pronunciation so that readers do not suffer the hardship of not being able to pronounce the characters. Regarding this point, I believe that compiling a correct national pronunciation dictionary for primary school teachers to follow and for students to consult on their own is sufficient to fulfill its mission. As for the plan to print all popular reading materials and primary school textbooks in phonetic notation of Chinese characters, it seems largely unnecessary. Forcibly implementing it may lead to the following drawbacks:</p>
<p>(1) Time-consuming: Although phonetic symbols alongside characters are necessary for new words, the number of new words in each lesson is extremely limited. If all familiar words that have already been read are also marked with phonetic notation, students will inevitably spend more effort on their eyesight when reading. Moreover, characters and symbols placed together can easily confuse the vision and distract attention, making teaching time-consuming, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>(2) Eye strain: Children's eyesight is not as good as adults'. With the current font size of textbooks, reading can sometimes be difficult. Adding phonetic symbols would make it even more difficult to see clearly, causing eye strain and easily leading to the danger of nearsightedness, which is very concerning.</p>
<p>(3) Prone to errors: Since it is not easy to see clearly, the chance of errors is bound to increase. Furthermore, with characters and symbols mixed together, young children may easily mistake the symbols as part of the characters, leading to errors.</p>
<p>(4) Research should be conducted first: In the United States, the difficulty of reading text is tested in detail using photographic methods, and the results are very good. The matter of phonetic notation of Chinese characters is of great importance. It is best for domestic universities or specialized educational institutions to test and research it first before considering implementation. Otherwise, it may not only be of little benefit, but may even be harmful.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>German Science and Chinese Books (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By Dr. Jieqin, German Library Committee</p>
<p>Regarding Shanghai, the Mutual Aid Association also donated a portion of its industrial books to Jiaotong University and books on national economics to the Business School of Central University. At the same time, it established close ties with Fudan University, Tongji University, and other research laboratories. Tongji University received special attention from the Mutual Aid Association and was regularly assisted. Although the internal economic situation in Germany was very difficult, it still spared no expense in donating valuable first editions to Tongji University.</p>
<p>The Mutual Aid Association has had relations with the Academia Sinica for several years. Recently, the Mutual Aid Association published a lengthy report, aiming to inform Germans about the Mutual Aid Association's collaborative experiment, an experiment to systematize China's scientific life. While striving to establish relations with various aspects of China, the Mutual Aid Association also hopes to establish similar relations with libraries, so that every interaction becomes a mutual interaction. This is what this article should explain.</p>
<p>The German Academic Mutual Aid Association's assistance to libraries is not like that of Americans, who focus solely on appearances. The will of the German Academic Mutual Aid Association is to enrich the content of Chinese libraries by donating German books to Chinese libraries or using them to exchange for Chinese books. It would be a great honor to receive book donations from the Chinese side.</p>
<p>Regarding Beiping, the former capital of China, the Mutual Aid Association has long established close ties with the Beiping Library. The books donated by the Mutual Aid Association to the library include the great works of botanist Landolt-Bornstein and books on subjects such as geography and archaeology. In addition, a considerable number of books on German language and literature have also been donated. In Beiping, the Mutual Aid Association also established complex relationships with other parties through the library's introduction, such as the libraries of Yenching University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, the Beiping Research Institute, National University, the Central Observatory, and the Catholic University of Peking.</p>
<p>Similar relationships also exist in Guangzhou, especially with the library and the university of Sun Yat-sen University. Other institutions and schools, such as Lingnan University, professors, and private individuals, such as Professor Wang, also have close relationships. However, the Mutual Aid Association's relationships with Beiping and Guangzhou are almost entirely based on exchange.</p>
<p>Wuhan, located in the center of the Yangtze River, has also established a relationship with the Mutual Aid Association because the association collected a large number of German books for Wuhan University. The books for Wuhan University were donated by German Ambassador to China Dr. Trautmann in his personal capacity, and they include books on biographies, history, law, ancient works, physics, and chemistry.</p>
<p>In Nanjing, the Mutual Aid Association is currently very close to Mr. Jiang Fuzong of the National Central Library. The Central University Library and the National Government Health Administration also have considerable connections. In addition, Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Provincial Library in Hangzhou, and the University of Hong Kong and the Royal Research Institute in Hong Kong are also related to the Mutual Aid Association.</p>
<p>It would be too verbose to list all the institutions, schools, and groups in China that have relationships with the Mutual Aid Association. However, if other libraries that were not originally related need assistance from the Mutual Aid Association after reading this article, the association will certainly not spare any effort or avoid any difficulties to provide assistance, in order to gain the sympathy and mutual aid of the other party.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Little Scientist</h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>The modern child is a little scientist. Little scientists engage in small experiments, small reforms, and small inventions. They want to play active games and not read dead science textbooks.</p>
<p>Of course, little scientists also need to use books, but they use living books: mountains, rivers, grass, trees, insects, birds, fish, and beasts are living books; clouds, rain, wind, snow, the sun, moon, stars, the vastness of the universe, and the smallness of microorganisms are all living books.</p>
<p>The entire universe is the science textbook used by little scientists, and it is also the little scientists' great laboratory. To obtain true knowledge and to unlock all the mysterious riddles of nature, one must make active use of these books in the great laboratory.</p>
<p>In fact, children are born as little scientists in this large laboratory. When the sky thunders, they ask, "Why is that?" When spiders eat mosquitoes, they watch and ask, "What are they doing?" And the famous great scientists and great inventors in the world have all used these living books and honed their skills in this great laboratory. For example, Darwin, Newton, and Galileo are good examples. Therefore, little scientists are promising great scholars and great inventors of the future, as long as you children do not forget these precious living books and this great laboratory.</p>
<h3>Literary Stories</h3>
<p>— Sun Yucai</p>
<p>(1) National Hero Shi Dakai</p>
<p>Shi Dakai was a famous general of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. He was not only proficient in military affairs but also deeply versed in literature. At that time, the generals were fighting for power and killing each other. Shi Dakai saw that this emerging revolutionary government would not work, so he led a troop alone and went straight to Sichuan, intending to launch another major offensive. Unfortunately, he could not support himself alone and eventually failed. According to the official report, Shi Dakai was captured and killed by Qing soldiers after his defeat; but according to unofficial history, Shi Dakai was not captured, nor was he killed. Indeed, such a national hero, we do not want him to be harmed.</p>
<p>Now, let's just talk about one of his stories; for some reason, his enemy Zeng Guofan also fell in love with his talent and wrote letters to persuade him to surrender. A revolutionary like Shi Dakai would certainly not be recruited by Zeng Guofan, the representative of feudalism. He wrote four poems and gave him a stern refusal. Two lines in the poem read:</p>
<p>"My ambition is unfulfilled, and people are suffering; there are tears everywhere in the southeast."</p>
<p>From these two lines, we can see his concern for the people's suffering and his true revolutionary colors. Not to mention that none of the generals at that time had such a benevolent heart, but even in modern times, it is not common.</p>
<p>(2) Nian Gengyao Asks About Characters</p>
<p>Nian Gengyao was a great general of the Qing Dynasty who once conquered Tibet, pacified the Sichuan border, and quelled Qinghai. His achievements were great.</p>
<p>It is said that he was very smart when he was young. His father hired several teachers to teach him at home, but none of the teachers were not embarrassed by him and willingly resigned.</p>
<p>Once, his father hired a very famous local teacher to teach him. On the first day of school, Nian Gengyao wrote the character "重" (chóng, heavy) and asked the teacher, "How do you explain this character '重'?"</p>
<p>"The character '重' means not light," the teacher replied.</p>
<p>"Wrong, wrong, if you break the character '重' apart, it is the character for "thousand" 千 and "li" 里, obviously it means very far, how can you say it means not light?" Nian Gengyao said with a smile.</p>
<p>The teacher's face flushed red, and he remained silent.</p>
<p>The next day, Nian Gengyao wrote the character "矮" (ǎi, short) and "射" (shè, shoot) and asked the teacher, "How do you explain these two characters?"</p>
<p>"The character '矮' means not tall, so people who are not tall are called dwarfs; the character '射' means to shoot an arrow," the teacher replied.</p>
<p>"According to your explanation, it is wrong. In my opinion, the characters '矮' and '射' should be switched around. You see, the character '射' is composed of the characters for "inch" 寸 and "body" 身, if a person's body is only one inch, wouldn't that be short? As for the character '矮', it is clearly composed of the characters for "arrow" 矢 and "abandon" 委, abandoning an arrow means shooting an arrow, right?" Nian Gengyao said with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>"The way the Chinese create characters is really upside down. For example, the characters '牛' (niú, cow) and '魚' (yú, fish) should also be switched around," Nian Gengyao continued.</p>
<p>"What is the reason for this?" the teacher asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"The character '魚' clearly resembles a four-legged animal, while the character '牛' is just a water animal with a head, tail, and no feet, so why is it upside down?" Nian Gengyao said.</p>
<p>The teacher felt that Nian Gengyao's talent was truly extraordinary and that he did not have the talent to teach him. He thought about it all night in bed, and as soon as the east turned white, he resigned and left.</p>

<h3>The Old Hen</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>The old hen was clucking, feeling that her life was very pitiful, not having laid many eggs to keep her company in her loneliness. She clucked like this everywhere in the cool air: "Cluck, cluck, so lonely! Cluck, cluck, so lonely!"</p>
<p>One day, she hatched several eggs from the grass nest. She was very happy, now she could hatch chicks to comfort her loneliness. She immediately arranged the grass pile into a nest like the one she lived in. She put the eggs in the middle of the grass nest and carefully squatted on top of the eggs. She covered the eggs with her wings and patiently waited for the chicks to hatch from the eggshells. She thought: Sweet days are coming soon.</p>
<p>Days passed, and today was the third Sunday after the hen began incubating the eggs. The old hen's clucking already sounded very happy and joyful. She gently tucked her wings in, and immediately heard "peeping" sounds from inside the eggshells. The old hen was really extremely happy. She clucked: "Cluck, cluck, so happy! Cluck, cluck, so happy!"</p>
<p>The hen's hope was realized, and chicks hatched from all the eggshells. The old hen took them out to look for food. She clucked all the way, and the chicks gathered around her. But she was very strange, why didn't the chicks look like her at all. Their mouths were flat, their bodies were long, their legs were short, and even their calls were "Xi ya," "Xi ya." This could not help but make the old hen suspicious.</p>
<p>They walked to the pond, and the old hen was about to teach them how to peck at food, but the group of children all jumped into the pond! The old hen cried out anxiously: "Cluck, cluck! Come and save them! Cluck, cluck! Come and save them!" The old duck heard the cries and quickly ran to the pond. The old hen shouted: "Cluck, cluck! The children are about to drown!" The old duck laughed loudly, "Gak, gak, gak! These are my children!" It also quickly jumped into the water.</p>
<p>The old hen stared blankly at them, only to see them swimming happily in the water. She had to walk back to the grass nest, clucking, clucking.</p>
<h3>How Plants Defend Themselves</h3>
<p>— Dong Chuncai</p>
<p>Whether plants or animals, they all have natural self-defense abilities. Like animals and humans, plants also have many enemies and dangers. In this natural world of the survival of the fittest, those plants that cannot defend themselves will eventually perish, only those that are strong can survive.</p>
<p>Many insects, fish, birds, and beasts can harm plants. Plants must defend themselves to survive. Of course, plants cannot fight enemies like animals: they cannot run away either: but they do have many self-defense methods to resist those greedy enemies.</p>
<p>Some plants have a foul odor, and few animals want to eat them; some plants have poisonous juices, which make herbivores who want to eat them not dare to try; some plants have a sour, astringent, or spicy taste, which makes people not dare to try a second time after tasting it once. Although some plants do not have foul odors, some animals like to eat them, but most herbivores know not to patronize them.</p>
<p>Plants defend themselves against enemies, not only by using unpleasant odors. Many plants are born with self-defense weapons, such as thorns, and if animals try to bite them, their mouths will be pierced. Some plants have stiff hairs to resist those greedy snails. Some plants can secrete mucus to defend against insect attacks.</p>
<p>Regarding plant self-defense, we may as well cite an example to illustrate. Mint has a special fragrance, and we often use it as a medicine, but herbivorous animals are very afraid of its scent. Rhododendron, Rhododendron mucronatum, etc., are all poisonous plants, and herbivorous animals do not dare to taste them.</p>
<p>The fruits of chestnuts are covered with thorns: hawthorns and the stems of trifoliate orange have thorns; barberry leaves also have spines below: the stems and leaves of thistles are covered with thorns: the edges of catbrier leaves have needle-like serrations: herbivores do not dare to touch these thorny plants. The buds of horse chestnuts and the stems of catchflies can secrete mucus to defend against insect attacks. The branches and leaves of nettles have stiff hairs and contain venom. If you are not careful and touch it, its stiff hairs will pierce your skin and inject the venom into your blood, which is quite painful.</p>
<p>Although plants have various self-defense methods, some animals can still harm them. However, there are very few animals that dare to oppose plants that have bad odors and thorns. Only a few animals dare to invade them; then, they will be very dominant in the struggle for survival.</p>
<h3>Story Picture</h3>
<p>— Zhang Youjian</p>
<p>—Going to the Sea—</p>
<p>(1) Rong'er took a fishing rod and stood on the edge of the boat to fish.</p>
<p>(2) The cook in the cabin was cutting up a big fish: suddenly, a fishing hook flew in through the window and happened to hook the fish's mouth.</p>
<p>(3) Rong'er pulled up the fishing rod; unexpectedly, he hooked a big fish without a tail.</p>
<p>(4) Fei'er saw this and wanted to take it and cook it himself, so he pretended to be horrified and said, "This was caught from the cabin, it should be returned to him, let me take it to return it to him." After speaking, he snatched the big fish and fishing rod from Rong'er's hands.</p>
<p>(5) The cook took the remaining tail to compare, and this fish was indeed his own. But Fei'er refused to return it to him and wanted to run away.</p>
<p>(6) The cook was extremely angry and kicked Fei'er away, and Fei'er fell head over heels into the sea.</p>
<h3>Problems with Children's Books</h3>
<p>— Huang Yide</p>
<p>"The new discovery of the 24th century is the discovery of children." Since this saying came out, it seems that our Chinese children's education has gradually become more valued. At the same time, our publishing industry, in recent years, the publication of children's books has been like "bamboo shoots after a rain."</p>
<p>This cannot be said to be anything but a blessing for Chinese children.</p>
<p>But Chinese children are unfortunately Chinese children. China is a China burdened with national humiliation, a China weak in the state and poor in the people, a China backward in everything: the problem of children's books in such a country is indeed a serious problem and it is not just publishing a little children's reading material that can be considered helpful for children's education or a contribution to children's culture.</p>
<p>You come up with a set of children's libraries, and I also come up with a set of children's libraries; you publish 200 copies of children's reading materials, and I publish 300 copies of children's reading materials. Is this competition for culture? Is this competition for business? Not to mention that, "the more the better," the phenomenon is good. Chinese education has not been popularized yet, and after education is universal, publishing thousands of copies, tens of thousands of copies, and hundreds of thousands of copies is not too much. But the most important issue is that fewer "children's reading materials" should be published, and more "children's textbooks" should be published. "Children's reading materials" are passive, while "children's textbooks" are active. Children in such a country do not need passive "reading materials" to read casually, but rather active "textbooks" to do things with their own hands. Because the children of such a China really don't have the leisure to read idle books, and really don't have the money to buy idle books!</p>
<p>Then what kind of textbooks should be given to children in such a country? This is one of the tasks that this association -- the Chinese Children's Culture Association -- should work hard on. We hope that people from all walks of life, school teachers, and family parents can give us assistance.</p>
<h3>The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor (II)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>The captain came up to me and said, "I have a package of goods that a man brought on board with us when we set sail. Now that he is dead, I want to sell these goods and pay the money to his descendants. If you are willing to accept it and sell it for me, then after you sell it, I will give you some money to reward you for your labor."</p>
<p>I was happy to do this, because I like to work. Then the captain called the ship's clerk to make a list of the packages I received.</p>
<p>He said, "Write it down in the name of Sinbad the Sailor."</p>
<p>When I heard these words, my heart was filled with joy. Then I let the captain know who I was, because he thought I was dead. At first, he didn't remember.</p>
<p>It's no wonder he didn't know me, because my recent life had changed me a lot.</p>
<p>You all must think that I should have recognized him immediately, but I must tell you that he was the leader of the ship on my second voyage, and it had been a very, very long time since I last saw him.</p>
<p>I said, "I am that Sinbad, whom you previously left on that island. At that time, I fell asleep by a stream, but when I woke up, I saw that the ship had gone far away."</p>
<p>The captain said, "Ah! I recognize you now! I cannot say due to what unfortunate circumstances you were left on the island. At that time, all of us had returned to the ship, but I didn't know you were missing. When a strong wind blew up, we realized you were no longer on board, but we couldn't sail back."</p>
<p>I was very happy to see him make good sales of my goods in various ports, so he handed over the money and goods to me.</p>
<p>We sailed from Sabella Island to a place where I accumulated various precious spices.</p>
<p>Here I saw many strange things, some looking like a cow with a fish's tail, a huge turtle, and many other things.</p>
<p>After some time, we arrived at Balsara, and from there we set off for Baghdad, at which time we arrived in this town. I was now very rich, and everything I owned was countless. I gave a large sum of money to the poor, and in addition to what I already owned, I bought many properties.</p>
<h3>Spring Bees</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Little friends, now as long as you are willing to go to the countryside for a stroll, you can see all kinds of flowers, red, yellow, purple, white... everywhere, east and west, the thriving scene is really a pleasure to see. And those groups of bees, you can see them everywhere, flying east for a while, flying west for a while, how beautiful!</p>
<p>Little friends, do you think that those groups of bees are just playing in the countryside? If you think so, then you are wronging them. They are not playing, they are actually working hard at their proper work! What work are they doing? Do you all understand?</p>
<p>They are all doing the work of "collecting flowers and making honey"!</p>
<p>They can work hard, so they can produce sweet sugar. The sugar they make is so sweet, and after this season of hard work, their food for the whole year is prepared, so they will never suffer from hunger! Little friends, have you heard the news of bees starving to death? I can tell you for sure that they won't. Because they are all willing to work hard!</p>
<p>Little friends, you are like them in this spring when you are young, so now that they are working so hard, how should you work hard at this time so as not to be ashamed of them? I hope you will work even harder than them!</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Eases, Spot Goods Arrive, Gold Standard Drops Four Yuan and Four Cents</h3>
<p>The market situation is mediocre and people's hearts are scattered.</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was weak due to the foreign exchange market turning easy, a batch of spot goods arriving from Tianjin, trade being suppressed, people's hearts being difficult to cheer up, and the Sassoon bank once made a move to reverse recent shillings, but the Nawi bank did not show excitement, and although there was a rebound in the middle, the result was still a decline. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw pound sterling stay steady against the US dollar rise, and it was said that after the big foot dealers closed the market, the United States still bought in at the listed price plus 1.25 cents. Forward silver prices also rose, and foreign exchange rates all rose. London pure gold fell five pence, and off-market forward transactions opened and then retreated to 76 yuan. The Central Bank's official rate was announced, with pound sterling steady against the US dollar rise, and the Customs Gold Unit falling five li. The gold standard price was lowered to 908 yuan and 90 cents. The market opened low in the morning, and after opening, due to the Bank of Japan releasing foreign exchange and more than 2,000 bars of Tianjin goods arriving, of which half had not found buyers, and some were selling futures, the number was not small. People's hearts were not encouraged, and the market immediately went downstream, but large investors maintained at the lower price, and there was still a rebound. Unexpectedly, the central government suddenly released some holdings, which fueled selling sentiment, and the market fell again. Banks took the opportunity to buy at low prices, which was able to maintain the price. Later, Sassoon again made a move to reverse recent shillings, and buying sentiment was slightly boosted, rebounding for a time, but under the high pressure of selling sentiment from Japanese commercial banks, the rise stopped temporarily, and many parties came out to sell, gradually going downstream. However, there were not many transactions, and the market situation was still very mediocre. There was quite a struggle in the middle, but in the end, the scattered bulls collapsed again, and there were those who tried to push down prices. Under the wait-and-see attitude of the large investors, the maintenance was weak. The trend still fell at noon. During the half day, people's hearts were normal, and the general trend was still able to support the market. Swaps were also panic-stricken due to the arrival of spot goods, and the discount was increased to 3 yuan. Now, after recording the half-day market situation,</p>
<p>The opening price was 875 yuan and 40 cents, down 1 yuan and 20 cents from the previous close. Although Fuxingyong was up from 5 yuan and 20 cents to 6 yuan and 20 cents, Mitsui Kawasaki sold March US dollars at 1.25, and Hengyu Dafa Yonghuixiang Yuanmao Yong sold bars one after another, retreating to 2 yuan and 20 cents. Wanxing Hengyu sold bars, rising to 3 yuan and 30 cents. Mitsui released May shillings at 1.25, and Huixiang Tongtaichang disposed of them, falling to 2 yuan. Yongli Dada Hengyu Wanxing Fuxingyong took the opportunity to buy bars at low prices, and the Macaulay bank bought June US dollars at 875, rising to 5 yuan. The central government was willing to sell July shillings at 7 pence, and Yuan Yi Fuxingyong took the opportunity to sell at a high price, retreating to 3 yuan. Hong Kang Yong Zhen Taida Decheng Chun Yuan Yong retail investors sold again, retreating to 1 yuan and 60 cents. HSBC bought June shillings at 0.0625, and Yongli Hengyu Fuyu Dalian helped to continue, and the market improved. Sassoon suddenly wanted May shillings at 1.25, and Yuanmao Yong Hengchang Yong Huixiang Yuanchang Yong continued to enter to 6 yuan, Shenkang Dada Fuyu Fuxingyong Hengyu Dachangxiang took the opportunity to dispose of them at a high price, falling to 2 yuan and 60 cents. Hengyu Deda Cheng continued to enter to 4 yuan and 20 cents, retail investors' mentality was still weak, Wanxing Dafa Yong Hengyu came to sell, further falling to 2 yuan and 10 cents. Hengyu Yu Fuxingyong maintained at low prices, rising to 3 yuan and 30 cents. Yongli continued to sell, and the closing price was 872 yuan and 20 cents. After the market closed, Yuanshengyong continued to enter, and Yuanmao Yong Chun Yuan Yong continued to sell, falling to within 2 yuan, and the situation was not good. The highest price during the half day was 876 yuan and 20 cents, and the lowest price was 871 yuan and 60 cents, with a fluctuation of 4 yuan and 60 cents. The result was a drop of 4 yuan and 40 cents compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on the Central Bank's gold standard price, which was lowered to 908 yuan and 90 cents, about 36 yuan lower than the closing price, less than 2 yuan more than the previous close. The April registered price was 870 yuan, the May price was 872 yuan, and the morning replenishment water was 862 yuan. The price of red gold was about 4 yuan higher. Spot goods were very abundant from Tianjin, and people's hearts were not encouraged, so swaps became more expensive. Tianjin goods only added 7 yuan. It was heard that about 2,000 bars of spot goods were shipped from Tianjin yesterday, of which half were to offset short positions, and the remaining 1,000 bars lacked buyers and were urgently waiting to be sold, which agitated the trade and made swaps more expensive. The multiple parties Yingfengheng paid the Yongfeng bank 28 bars at 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the field was normal. In summary, Fuxingyong Shunli Deda Cheng Tongtaichang Fuyu Changda Huixiang Hongxing Yuanshengyong Qianchangxiang Yifeng Yifeng Yongdacheng and others were on the buying side, Hengyu Yuqingyong Futai Yongyu Xinxiang Dafa Yong Qianchangxiang Shunmao Wanxing Dachangxiang Tongfeng Hengyuan Yi Chun Yuan Yong Dingkang and others were on the selling side.

Wanxing did more than 800 bars together, and 200 bars were squeezed out. The Guangbang Shen Da Hengxing's entry and exit were normal. The total number of transactions in the half day was 27,951 bars (equivalent to national currency 244,7806.56).</p>

<h3>Japanese Banks Sell Off, Foreign Exchange Market Becomes Easier</h3>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, London's large bars were steady in both near and far terms, but after the market closed, the United States still traded in at the listed price plus 1.25. New York silver prices rose by 25, and forward silver prices in Monte Rio also rose by 1 li to 3 li.

This is also a foreign exchange relationship. The Central Bank's official rate was announced, with pound sterling steady and the US dollar rising by 0.0625, and the Customs Gold Unit falling by 5 li. After opening, Japanese commercial banks sold off, easing the market, but banks took the opportunity to maintain at low prices. HSBC's official rate was announced, with pound sterling steady and the US dollar rising by 0.0625, which was a steady situation. After entering the market, although the central government had some selling pressure, it was slightly boosted because Sassoon once made a move to reverse recent shillings. However, because Hong Kong and Japanese banks had some supply, the tight situation was blocked. Chinese merchants' mentality was not very encouraged, and the trend turned easier. By the time the recent selling prices were received at noon, pound sterling was at 1 shilling, 7 pence, 125 and 1875 matching, and the US dollar was at 38 yuan, 125. Compared to the previous close, pound sterling eased by 0.03125, and the US dollar was hard by 1875. Chinese merchants' squeeze was normal, and banks' buying and selling were inconsistent. However, Japanese banks had more selling pressure, and the central government slightly bought shillings from Sassoon. Hong Kong seemed to have selling pressure. Now, the half-day transactions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The recent selling price of pound sterling opened in the morning at 1 shilling, 7 pence and 125. Mitsui released May 125, and Macaulay sold April 1875 to Huabi.

<h3>Securities: Delivery Approaches, Government Bonds Rise in Near Term and Fall in Far Term</h3>
<p>Short Squeeze Seems More Intense Than Long Squeeze</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was getting closer and closer to the near-term delivery, and because foreign loans were still intertwined and not completely hopeless, banks could provide a large amount of loans due to the increase in capital, and the banking group loans were about to be established. The situation abroad was irrelevant to our own, and the market was still more of a short squeeze than a long squeeze. A lot of the 13th issue was purchased, and the 47th, 48th, and 53rd issues were also absorbed, while the 43rd issue had quite a bit of selling pressure. At this time when delivery was approaching, both sides were squeezing each other due to the lack of chips, so the price fluctuations were not normal. This is also a common phenomenon during each delivery. Yesterday, the financial sector purchased a lot when the market opened in the morning, and large investors were very active in buying, such as the 47th, 48th, and 53rd issues, and they were all new transactions. Short-term swaps were also not quiet, and the market price was uniformly slightly higher, by 1 jiao to 4 jiao. The second round was not opened until the afternoon. The front positions were still stable, but large investors stopped buying, and the rear positions turned weak, falling by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 3 jiao and 5 fen. The short squeeze was fast and the changes were instantaneous, making it very unpredictable. Because the time was late in the afternoon, one round was changed to be done, and the market price continued to weaken by 1 jiao and 2 jiao. The near term was relatively strong. The market price results were quite distorted, with most of the near term rising and the far term falling, completely in a short squeeze situation. The total turnover was 15,065,000 yuan. The different situations of price increases and decreases are listed separately below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Yanghang reported that the New York stock market continued to rise yesterday (22nd), first because the bill to pay bonuses to demobilized veterans was passed in the House of Representatives with a majority of votes, which shows that the rumor that the president's veto will be overturned is rampant. Second, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, Troianovsky, said in a speech in New York, "The danger of war is becoming increasingly apparent." The bond market was mixed, European government bonds were weak, and small exchange stocks were mixed and tired. However, utility stocks were still stable. Wheat rose due to the strong situation in Liverpool and buying caused by the dust storm. The total turnover for the day was 780,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: U.S. Cotton Leads High-Priced Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>After consecutive days of sharp decline in the yarn market, signs of a rebound are emerging. Simultaneously, U.S. cotton continues to rise, boosting confidence. Coupled with bullish positions in the current month remaining strong, the upward trend intensifies, breaking through the 180-yuan barrier. However, the current demand from yarn buyers is weaker than before, but some anticipate a return to bullish conditions.</p>
<p>This Month's Yarn at 80 Yuan</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for standard yarn saw prices rise due to the upward trend of U.S. cotton. Sellers were scarce, and the market sentiment turned tight. Speculators covered their positions, and after several days of declines, positive news triggered a strong rebound. A certain individual's long positions for the current month remained unchanged, further fueling the bullish trend. Distant months were also influenced. As a result, the current month rose by 1.60 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, with other months rising by 1.10 to 1.40 yuan. The afternoon session saw no significant changes, and the market appeared more stable. The current month rose by an additional 0.20 yuan compared to the morning closing price, while distant months fluctuated by 0.10 to 0.30 yuan. Sales included 2,600 bales from Yida, 1,350 bales from Dafeng, 950 bales from Taichang, 900 bales from Zhenda, 400 bales from Xinyi, 550 bales from Taidian, and 450 bales from Daji. Purchases included 600 bales from Tongxing, 750 bales from Renfeng, 1,700 bales from Dafu, 600 bales from Senkang, 800 bales from Yichang, 1,300 bales from Changfeng, 1,600 bales from Runkang, and 500 bales from Hengchang. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn    Highest Price    Lowest Price    Closing Price    Change from Previous Day    Inventory</p>
<p>March        180.6       179.9       180.6        Up 1.80          10,500</p>

<p>Total                                              247,150</p>
<p>Actual Sales Only 700 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were moderate. Daily statistics show that various trading houses purchased a total of 705 bales. Prices were similar to the previous day. The trading volume of various trading houses is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland   190  Changsha  60   Guangdong  185  Fujian  15</p>
<p>Brokers  25   Nanyang   25   Sichuan  150  Shantou 15</p>
<p>Jiangxi  10   Henan   20   Tianjin  10</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm, with U.S. cotton continuing to rise. According to telegrams, the opening market was sluggish, but by the closing bell, due to positive political news for bullish positions and short covering, prices surged. Indian cotton also rose, boosting confidence. Short covering activity pushed the market up. However, large short positions remained unchanged. U.S. spot cotton has risen by 95 points from its previous low.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Rebounds by 0.35 Yuan</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for standard cotton saw all months rebound, exhibiting a strong trend. This was due to U.S. cotton continuing to rise by over 30 points in recent days, and Indian cotton also rising by 4 rupees, prompting short covering and slightly increased buying, which lifted the market. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session saw a flat market, but selling pressure remained strong. However, positive overseas cotton market news and a 2.5-rupee increase in the off-exchange Indian cotton market kept the market tight. Ultimately, near-month prices were the same as the morning prices, while distant months rose by 0.05 yuan. Sales included 1,200 dan from Gengfeng, 1,600 dan from Yiyu, 3,800 dan from Dafeng, 1,900 dan from Daji, 1,700 dan from Junchang, 1,900 dan from Shenji, 2,200 dan from Yicheng, 1,800 dan from Shengyuan, 1,200 dan from Yongda, and 7,100 dan from Yifeng. Purchases included 1,200 dan from Suilong, 4,700 dan from Dafu, 5,200 dan from Changfeng, 2,000 dan from Yichang, 2,400 dan from Runkang, 2,700 dan from Xincheng, 1,800 dan from Xinxing, 2,400 dan from Yuanxingchang, 2,400 dan from Renfeng, 2,100 dan from Tongxing, and 1,600 dan from Taichang. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Rises Sharply Against Short Positions</h3>
<p>—Rebounds by 20-30 Points—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton after-hours market was firm. Until noon, the March contract fell due to delivery notices reaching 7,800 bales, mostly absorbed by spot traders. There were few sellers, and trading houses continued to enter the market. Japanese buyers purchased old cotton, while new buyers were scarce. Trading houses awaited developments in Washington. Later, news that the House of Representatives had passed the Patman Bonus Bill caused short positions to cover, and the market turned firm. Simultaneously, rising wheat and stocks also boosted cotton market sentiment. Hester estimated factory consumption for the week at 263,000 bales, and Liverpool inventories at 307,000 bales. The closing trend was very bullish, with spot prices rising by 25 points and futures by 23 to 34 points. English spot cotton fell by 5 points, while futures rose by 3 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to short selling and long liquidation, but later firmed due to good spot demand and commercial buying. Pingle rose by 4.5 rupees, Oomra by 5.75 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek by 1.75 rupees. The original telegram records are as follows (dated the 23rd):</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton    Change from Previous Day   Equivalent in National Currency</p>
<p>5  10.95    Up 23 32.10</p>
<p>7  10.99    Up 24 32.20</p>

<p>Bai Luo Creek  128.25   Up 1.75  29.40</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bai Luo Creek cotton on the 23rd was 221 rupees, up 2.75 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Fell Sharply Last Week Due to the European Situation</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 22nd reported on the cotton market for the week: At the beginning of the week, the market fell sharply again due to long liquidation and the resumption of hedging, to protect inventories or cotton in storage. Furthermore, the European political situation was chaotic, and foreign exchange rates were unstable. Later, short covering and buying by trading houses stemmed the decline, but with sluggish demand, prices fluctuated up and down. It was reported that Southern senators supported the government's continued loan policy and the encouragement of export sales, as well as the elimination of the continued tax, which triggered a rebound. Market participants are awaiting the authorities' actions. The House of Representatives passed a provision in the Penhale Act to exempt farmers from taxes on the production of three bales, which may face strong opposition. The spot market shows no signs of softening. Hedging was minimal after the decline on Monday.</p>

<h3>Grains: Foreign Wheat Rises; Flour Wheat Soars</h3>
<p>—Bran Market Shows Little Movement—</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market this morning, all months showed a sharp rise. Foreign wheat quotations showed a Chicago increase of approximately 24 points and a Canadian increase of 0.10 yuan. At the opening, foreign wheat continued to rise. Furthermore, due to the turmoil in Eastern Europe and the fear of an outbreak, this situation is currently not of great concern. However, imports of wheat from the East may inevitably be affected. Therefore, both industry insiders and external buyers were active, and market sentiment gradually rose. Compared to the opening, the current month's market saw a slight easing of customer demand, and the trend was peaceful. For the deferred months, external investors bought in, and it was reported that Nanyang trading houses also purchased a significant amount. However, large factories sold off. Nevertheless, confidence remained as strong as ever. As a result, the current month rose by 0.015 yuan, April by 0.0275 yuan, May by 0.04 yuan, June by 0.045 yuan, and July/August by 0.0525 yuan.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market this morning, all months showed a uniformly firm trend. Foreign wheat quotations showed a Chicago increase of approximately 24 points and a Canadian increase of 0.10 yuan. At the opening, all months showed positive signs, and foreign wheat continued to rise. Furthermore, the serious situation in Eastern Europe boosted previously subdued confidence. Therefore, both near-term and distant-term asking prices were uniformly high, rising by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day. At the afternoon opening, trading in all months remained stable, with confidence even stronger in distant months. Generally, people fear that foreign wheat may be affected. As a result, the current month rose by 0.03 yuan, July by 0.06 yuan, and August by 0.05 yuan. The spot wheat market remained stable. High-quality wheat saw a slight increase of 0.01 to 0.02 yuan, while medium-quality wheat remained unchanged. Anhui Su County wheat was priced at 3.66 yuan, Shandong wheat at 3.64 yuan, and Bengbu wheat at 3.59 yuan, with a total of 1,500 bags purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat  March 21  March 22  Change</p>

<p>Spot 82.250  83.00  Up 0.750</p>
<p>The bran market has remained flat for several days, with no significant changes. This is because the local factories' output has gradually increased, and the demand from inland trading houses is limited. There has also been little movement in the Eastern districts. Therefore, the asking price for each batch remains around 2.56 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>The rice market has been reporting frequent declines in prices due to abundant inventories. The market was unable to change yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 20 shipments arrived from various trading houses, totaling nearly 4,000 shi (a unit of dry measure). Both wholesale and retail markets were flat. The market was high in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Prices for high-quality and medium-quality japonica and thin indica rice fell by several cents to nearly a jiao (a unit of currency), while Du Jian rice also softened. Due to limited sales, Yin Bian Yuan rice continued to fall by about a jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over 40 boats arrived from various trading houses in the lower reaches of the river. Sales in the market were flat. Prices for high-quality white japonica rice fell by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan, medium-quality rice by slightly over 0.10 yuan, and top-quality Yang Jian and top-quality Bian Yuan rice by slightly over a jiao. Early thin indica rice prices fell by several cents, while other rice showed a softening trend.</p>
<p>(Imported Rice) Demand from customers was weak, and the market turned flat and soft. However,囤戶 (speculators) believe that the situation in Eastern Europe is becoming increasingly urgent, and that the grain market may tighten in the future. Therefore, they are no longer eager to sell. However, demand from local customers is also weak, and the market is difficult to improve. The total daily volume was only around 5,000 bags, distributed to inland areas by local merchants.</p>
<p>(Hakka Xian Rice) After the price drop the day before, sales remained strong yesterday. However, inland trading houses were very price-sensitive. Although trading was active yesterday, prices continued to be flat and soft. Over 3,000 bags were sold throughout the city, all of which were purchased by inland buyers.</p>
<p>(Soybeans) Due to sluggish sales, the market was flat and long, with short-term activity. Two cars of Yingzhou soybeans were opened at a price of 3.50 yuan and 3.54 yuan, respectively. One car of Bengbu soybeans was priced at 3.40 yuan. Two cars of Dalian Siping Street soybeans were priced at 4.10 yuan and 4.08 yuan, respectively. Over 700 bags of Hankou soybeans were priced from 3.47 yuan to 3.22 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Needle Eyebrow Tea Sales Still Strong</h3>
<p>In the local tea market, sales to foreign merchants have remained stagnant in recent days. However, northern trading houses from Tianjin and Shandong require large quantities of Needle and Eyebrow green teas, as spring sales have already begun. Over 700 boxes of each type of tea were purchased from various tea shops in the past two days. Needle Eyebrow tea was priced at 15 to 16 yuan, and Eyebrow tea at 11 yuan. The tea will be shipped for export soon. British firms such as Jardine Matheson and Yieh Hwa have also sent telegrams to reduce prices and promote sales of Zhen Mei green tea and Hubei red tea.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestically Produced Coarse White Sugar Rises Another 0.20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Re-exported Dutch Coarse White Sugar Up 0.30 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to show a tight trend. The potential implementation of tariffs on foreign sugar kept sentiment bullish. The Sugar Association raised the single-sale price of high-quality domestically produced Guangdong coarse white sugar by 0.20 yuan to 17.20 yuan. High-quality and secondary-grade sugars were priced at a 0.10 yuan increase from the previous day's listed prices, to 17.10 yuan, 17.00 yuan, and 16.90 yuan, respectively. The price of re-exported 24 Dutch coarse white sugar rose even more sharply, increasing by another 0.30 yuan to 5.20 yuan. It was rumored that off-exchange prices were even higher. Due to rising raw material prices, local factories were unable to continue production of refined white sugar, resulting in a temporary lack of supply. Taikoo sugar was priced at 18.00 yuan, an increase of 0.30 to 0.40 yuan. Chaozhou traders offered the original 150 bags of crystal sugar at 13.00 yuan, 100+ bags from Hainan at 10.05 yuan, and 100+ bags from Huanggang Qing at 9.00 to 9.90 yuan, with little difference from previous prices. Huilai sold 200 bags of raw sugar at 9.50 to 9.55 yuan, an increase of 0.10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Hooping Tinplate Sells Well</h3>
<p>Hooping tinplate is a popular product in the tinplate market because its use is more economical than standard tinplate. Additionally, cigarette factories must use it to make large boxes. As such, market demand is quite strong. Recently, due to limited arrivals and low inventories, prices have risen slightly. It is estimated that each 200-pound bundle is worth 24 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan from the previous day. It is reported that trading houses such as Xietai, Fuji, and Ni Jingji have a strong demand for this product. Unfortunately, few traders in the market hold this product, resulting in very tight prices.</p>
<h3>Blue Lead is Being Hoarded for Speculation</h3>
<p>Blue lead trading has increased slightly recently. Overseas prices have increased sharply, so wealthy financial firms have begun hoarding. Brokers have been scouring the market for several days, and over 3,000 bars were sold yesterday. The lack of freely circulating goods has resulted in another 0.15 yuan increase in price. The estimated value is 13.90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Refined Antimony Falls Again by Over 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>There are few transactions in refined antimony, and prices are very soft. It is estimated that each ton is worth 760 yuan, a decrease of approximately 15 yuan from the previous day. Transactions were limited to small purchases and sales, with no large-scale negotiations. It is reported that there are many arrivals from the production areas. Market sentiment is weak, and future market prices are likely to fall more than they rise.</p>

<p>—Bi Wu</p>
<p>Just as adults and gentlemen were engaged in high-sounding discussions over tea and wine about "Women Returning to the Home," news of women's suicides flew in daily like snowflakes: this silent, concrete response was terribly bleak and cruel!</p>
<p>In recent days, in addition to a series of suicide reports, suddenly came the shocking national Liu Jinggui murder case: suicide, murder, the Chinese women's world of 1935 is almost slaughtered into pieces. But in this bloody and bitter atmosphere, there are also some funny, laughable materials, the most prominent of which is the propaganda of a certain Yao transforming from a woman into a man.</p>
<p>Why are there so many tricks in today's female world? What is the common thread among these tricks?</p>
<p>Suicide, many people already think, is the behavior of the weak, while murder, on the other hand, should be considered the behavior of the strong. But not necessarily. Looking at Liu Jinggui's remarks: "I came here today specifically to beat Teng Shuang, because her husband 'Ji Jiong Ming' was my former fiancé. Originally, her husband deceived me, and I originally intended to beat her husband to death, but because I could not achieve it, I beat her to death." This statement is very clear: Liu Jinggui, who committed murder, was also a weak woman, excessively angered by oppression.</p>
<p>As for a certain Yao, a woman who falsely claims to have become a man, this is because most people still think that men are superior to women, and that if a woman can transform into a man, then that person must have a special, heaven-moving sincerity, and only then will this result occur. Therefore, a certain Yao's trick is precisely the desperate trick of a weak woman when she has no other choice.</p>
<p>When weak women reach a dead end, they resort to suicide, or murder, or prostitution, or playing tricks.</p>
<p>How can she be so weak? Because she has no power, no social status, no hope, and is given only a narrow home and the status of a slave. She sees everything in the world as empty, and all money, power, art, and fame do not belong to her. The most real and most important thing she sees is herself. For the sake of her own problems, she can abandon herself to suicide, or abandon herself to murder, or abandon herself to playing other tricks. Moreover, in her situation, even if she does not abandon herself, society sometimes forces her to do so.</p>
<p>The increasing number of unfortunate events in the women's world recently demonstrates that women's status in society is becoming weaker. "Women Return to the Home!" The revival of the good wife and wise mother ideology has increased her new, heavier burden than in previous years, and stripped away the small amount of hope for liberation she had before. In life and in thought, she is only given blows and not a bright way out. She can only stumble and stumble blindly.</p>
<p>However, "a hungry person does not choose food." Although this is a thousand-year-old saying, there is still room for correction. No matter how hungry and thirsty you are, you cannot eat poison or snatch other people's life-saving soup to eat. Women today are indeed suffering from the same urgency as hunger and thirst, but in this urgency, they still cannot stumble blindly in confusion. Instead of having the courage to commit suicide, murder, and various meaningless self-destructive acts, why not use it to fight this society? As long as we can overcome the various restrictions in life and thought, we have a life that is just as important as a man's. It is only because the status of the entire society in the world is low that we women have today's new oppression and new bondage; we must fight for women's equal status in society and the equal status of society in the world. Merely destroying ourselves is not the right way.</p>
<p>Do not put personal comfort, love, and vanity first, but take the brightness of society as a prerequisite. Society does not need people to abandon themselves, but needs people to bravely struggle and sacrifice. Although the situation is urgent, we women must not admit defeat and fall into the path of destruction.</p>
<h3>Love and Murder</h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>While the discussion of “Who killed Ruan Lingyu” still occupies much newspaper space, another piece of news about a love triangle murder case suddenly emerges. Various newspapers use headline-sized characters to show the seriousness and peculiarity of the matter. The protagonist of the tragic case, Liu Jinggui, a student at the Beiping North American Art School, was once in love with the athlete Dai Ming and had a marriage agreement. However, soon after, Dai Ming met Teng Shuang, a physical education teacher at Zhicheng Middle School, during the North China Games. Consequently, Dai Ming paid Liu Jinggui six hundred yuan to terminate the agreement and married Teng Shuang. From then on, Liu Jinggui harbored deep resentment and vowed revenge. Eventually, he shot and killed his rival in love, Teng Shuang, and became a prisoner himself. Murder is a path to death, and Liu Jinggui certainly understood this. This makes the social significance of murder and self-imprisonment no less serious than the question of "Who killed Ruan Lingyu," thus attracting much attention from various parties.</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, the Morning Post published an article titled "Reflections on the Liu Jinggui Case" by Mr. Lin Gengbai. At the outset, he made the following statement about contemporary Chinese society:</p>
<p>"Modern Chinese society, filled with contradictory consciousness and ideologies, seems to have entered a divergent path in the past year or two. On the one hand, a new culture has not yet been established, while on the other hand, the old, declining culture is gradually raising its head. We deeply recognize that at this stage, China urgently needs to strive for the revival of national culture, but the revival of national culture should have two basic conditions: one is the completion of 'anti-feudal culture,' and the other is the establishment of 'anti-imperialist culture.' At the same time, it must be understood that feudal culture is not the spiritual foundation of our national culture, but rather it is a fatal wound that destroys the beautiful national culture... As for the invasion of imperialist culture, it seems everyone is very clear about it, but the cultural movement of these many years has not only failed to eliminate its influence but has instead propelled its wheels. This pathological overcorrection is exactly the opposite of the illusion of being infatuated with feudal culture, and unconsciously stands in opposition."</p>
<p>After making this analysis, Mr. Lin then raised the Liu Jinggui case, considering it a product of the struggle between the old and the new, and a social problem worthy of discussion. This analysis is correct, but Mr. Lin did not clearly point out why the old, declining culture is gradually raising its head, and why the invasion of imperialist culture remains the same. Not only remains the same, but according to Mr. Lin's observation, it is precisely "propelling its wheels"! Therefore, the social pathology of the Liu Jinggui murder case seems to only be a superficial explanation, without touching its root. Now, I would like to add to Mr. Lin's analysis, which may make the social pathology clearer.</p>
<p>Originally, the so-called "culture" is the superstructure of society, while the foundation of the lower layers of society is the economic organization. China's inherent economic organization has already disintegrated, and a new organization has not yet been established under the joint attack of internal and external troubles. In the process of being driven to a dead end, some people are nostalgic for the past, thinking that returning to the past may be a solution. Thus, returning to the past has become a new plan for the new China. The economic organization of the past created a society with feudal ideology. In the call for returning to the past, the feudal economic organization certainly cannot be revived in modern Chinese society, but feudal culture can be revived to poison the youth of modern China. On the other hand, the aggression of imperialists is intensifying day by day. Although there is talk of genuine friendship and high-sounding slogans, anyone with a discerning mind will realize the "tacit understanding" in it. We have no solutions in economics or politics now, so how can "anti-imperialist culture" be produced? Even if it can be produced, who would cherish it like Mr. Lin, who is so insightful? Therefore, "propelling its wheels" is an inevitable and natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>The foundation-filling economic organization has collapsed, and of course, it cannot produce a more "beautiful culture," "so in today's Chinese society, there are only remnants of the feudal social customs of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries" (to borrow Mr. Lin's words). China is a semi-colony, and complete modern capitalism is of course impossible, "but the growth of the consciousness and emotions of capitalist society in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries" (to use Mr. Lin's words again) is possible. In this current Chinese society, where old wounds have not healed and new poisons are added, what kind of young people are produced? Dai Ming and Liu Jinggui are the best representatives of the middle social class. Individualistic, selfish, and self-interested views of life dominate their entire consciousness. To satisfy their own private sorrows, they disregard the interests of others. At the same time, they are all short-sighted, unable to see society, unable to see the world, unable to see the future, unable to see the real enemy, only knowing what they want to do individually. Especially economically well-off young men, taking advantage of social advantages, pursue the opposite sex, changing affections from morning to night, which is their daily routine. Young women, because the feudal atmosphere still surrounds them, and feudal consciousness is still deeply rooted in their minds, and they have no real economic power in their hands, although they yearn for free love, in the end, they still regard marriage as a lifelong nursing home and regard men as lifelong backers. Therefore, the occurrence of changes in this nursing home and the seizure of the backer is a lifelong disaster, so how can they not be cautious and vigilant? Thus, the weak often cautiously defend against rivals in love. If they cannot win, they commit suicide, and if they cannot commit suicide, they end up depressed. The strong (although temporarily strong, are still equivalent to suicide and are still weak) often take adversarial offensive actions. Liu Jinggui's killing of Teng Shuang is an example. Dai Ming's romantic behavior and playing with women is precisely the consciousness and emotions of "capitalist society in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries" that color him. Because only such a society can give him such freedom. Liu Jinggui's jealousy because of lost love, and his mutual slaughter with the same kind because of jealousy, are cultivated by "feudal habits of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries" and "heroism" and "individualism" of the "eighteenth and nineteenth centuries". In feudal society, women are ashamed of being abandoned and have no real economic power. At the same time, heroism and individual thought make her only have herself. And if there is a conflict of interest with herself, she kills without hesitation. Even if she commits a crime, she doesn't care. Liu Jinggui, under the double attack of these poisons, finally became a murderer.</p>
<p>Therefore, although Liu Jinggui's murder and Dai Ming's playing with women are certainly their own fault, if these two young people were not born into this current society attacked by the new and old poisons, they would definitely not be like this. But now they have become criminals of society. This society, filled with evil air, poisons the young people with weak wills, making them criminals of society. Society poisons them and them. And the fallen young people have exacerbated the disorder of society. The two evolve in a cyclical manner.</p>
<p>Satisfying one's personal desires, venting personal habits, murder and suicide, if this continues, social order will become more chaotic and increasingly deepened.</p>
<p>Therefore, to make this society return to peace and tranquility, it is necessary to eliminate the new and old poisons that harm society. To eliminate these new and old poisons, as Mr. Lin Gengbai said, it is necessary to "complete the anti-feudal culture" and "establish the anti-imperialist culture."</p>

<h3>Section 2: Marriage and Family Forms in Primitive Times</h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>According to historians, it has been about 25,000 years since humans emerged from the animal state to the present (the so-called origin of modern humans in history), but there are only four or five thousand years of recorded history. In this way, humans slowly evolved from the distant past into cultured people like today. In this long process of evolution, human economic, social, moral, and sexual relationships must also adapt to the evolutionary stages of human beings and have various different forms, just as black people and white people today have different male-female relationships and lifestyles.</p>
<p>Many shortsighted bourgeois scholars only see the male-female relationship since history began and believe that women's non-independence and subordination to men are determined by history. Since it was like this in the past, it must be like this in the future. At the same time, they believe that the family and marriage form of monogamy is natural and immutable. This view is either intentional deception or ignorant exposure.</p>
<p>We know that the status of women in society or the family is closely related to the stage of economic development. In other words, the position occupied by women in the stage of economic development, that is, the nature of the productive labor they bear, determines the status of women in society or the family. Family and marriage forms are also inseparable from the stage of economic development. For example, the family and marriage forms in the agricultural economic stage and the industrial economic stage are completely different.</p>
<p>Regarding the male-female relationship in primitive society, Bachofen's research is very interesting. In his book "Mother Right" (Droit-materna), he elaborates on the evolutionary process of human sexual relationships. The important points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In primitive humans, the sexual relationship was promiscuous.</p>
<p>(2) This type of sexual intercourse did not allow for the establishment of paternity. Children only knew their mother and did not know their father, thus giving rise to the matrilineal system, that is, the matriarchal system. All ancient peoples originated from this.</p>
<p>(3) As a result, women and motherhood became the only recognized relatives of posterity. The degree to which they enjoyed respect, according to Bachofen's imagination, reached the point where they had matriarchal rule.</p>
<p>(4) Later, it transitioned to monogamy, and women were exclusively at the disposal of men. (Refer to Cai Hesen's "History of Social Evolution")</p>
<p>After Bachofen, Morgan collected a lot of material on this aspect among various barbarian peoples, thus confirming the correctness of Bachofen's research. Moreover, he further systematically studied the family and marriage forms in primitive times. He divided the primitive marriage and family system into the following four types, and these four forms are properly adapted to the stage of social and economic development. Now, according to Morgan's opinion, a simple explanation is given for each form for the reader's reference.</p>
<p>(1) Consanguineous Marriage Family</p>
<p>Humans initially lived in groups, engaging in collective survival competition with poisonous snakes, fierce beasts, or foreign races. They all relied on acquiring natural objects to maintain a common life. Whether strong or weak, male or female, they could only live in this common group. Individuals had no possibility of surviving alone. Under this circumstance, on the one hand, in order to strengthen unity, and on the other hand, in order to reproduce the race, group marriage was practiced in the consanguineous group. That is, brothers and sisters naturally became a group of couples. In this group, there is a matriarch who is the master of this community. The so-called matriarchal clan originated from this.</p>
<p>(2) Punaluan Marriage Family Humans entered the early stage of the uncivilized era. Production tools were quite developed, and the cultivation of grains and the raising of livestock were invented. In this era, the productive labor of grains and livestock was borne by women, and men were engaged in war and hunting. Therefore, women occupied an important position in the economy. This is the economic foundation for the emergence of the matrilineal clan. Here, with the matrilineal system as the center, the inheritance of property was also limited to women. As for the marriage form, because humans entered the early stage of the uncivilized era, they experienced that consanguineous marriage was harmful to their racial reproduction. Therefore, they used the matrilineal system to divide bloodlines, and a group of brothers and a group of sisters who did not belong to the same mother made a group marriage. The so-called matriarchal era began from this.</p>
<p>(3) Pairing Marriage Family</p>
<p>This is a family formed by temporary monogamy. Humans reached the middle and late stages of the uncivilized era. Agriculture and animal husbandry were quite developed. The economic life of the matrilineal clan was very rich, and men could not inherit their mother's inheritance. Therefore, they could only join the wife's clan group to live. Men had no economic control and only performed the task of war for the wife's clan. At this time, although the marriage form was a monogamous union, its separation and reunion were very easy. This is the peak period of matriarchy.</p>
<p>(4) Polygynous Marriage Family</p>
<p>This is the family form that occurred after the matriarchal system was overturned and the patriarchal system was established. In this era, the technology of agriculture and animal husbandry developed, and the form of labor also changed, requiring a large amount of labor. Therefore, the prisoners captured by men from war were no longer killed but were used as slaves to make them work. In this way, production became more prosperous, and there were surplus things in addition to consumption. From then on, men used the preferential right of economic control to command slaves to overthrow the matriarchal system and establish the patriarchal system. The so-called patriarchal clan occurred from this. The head of the clan was a man. They plundered women from foreign races from war to be their wives and concubines, thus forming a polygamous family. The so-called plunder marriage was a product of this era.</p>
<p>From then on, not only did women become slaves of men, but with the occurrence of the private property system, differences in classes such as rich, poor, noble, and lowly also occurred between men. The primitive community of joint production and joint consumption has also forever become a historical relic!</p>
<h3>The Life of Women in the Rural Areas of Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In western Shanghai, outside the circle of roads built across the border, villages where families live together are scattered like chess pieces in the crisscrossing vegetable fields. Their main livelihoods are farming, doing petty business, pulling carts, and selling labor in factories.</p>
<p>Women, in addition to shouldering the burden of life like men, must also add the labor of cooking, washing clothes; taking care of children, making shoes, and mending torn clothes, which are needless to say.</p>
<p>Here, the support of a family's livelihood is actually not men, but women. In every couple, women always occupy an important role in production.</p>
<p>In farming couples, men spend most of their days leisurely going east and west; weeding, hoeing, and fertilizing are mostly women's duties. Letting older children roll around in garbage heaps, enduring all dangers, letting babies clinging to their breasts lie at home crying, they stay in the fields. When their backs are sore, they carry a full load of vegetables before they can come back; panting: "Oh, I'm exhausted!" They throw their headscarves aside, sit down, and the crying baby nestles in their arms. The little fellow tugs and pulls, crying because he's hungry. The mother, who hasn't even caught her breath yet, has to hurry to cook dinner. Before the sky is completely light, if the fields don't need them to do any work today, it is often the wife who carries vegetables to the street to sell. ——Generally, husbands are always more leisurely than wives.</p>
<p>Working men have their washing and cooking arranged by their mothers, wives, and daughters. If they are bachelors, cheap restaurants can solve their eating problems. What about women? They don't have such blessings! Not only do they still cook and wash their own clothes, but if they have children, they cannot shirk the responsibility of raising and caring for them; moreover, economically, the wages they earn cannot be handled as freely as men's. Their parents, brothers, or in-laws and husbands are very strict in their restrictions on them. They must hand over all their income to the head of the family: "How can I not hand it over? Expenses for gifts and the family's food and drink are all paid by him!" To make a piece of clothing, they still have to ask them for it, and they often suffer impolite rejections. They get up very early in the morning, and those whose factories are far away have to run three or five miles. Twelve hours of labor, plus the time spent running and eating, wastes fifteen or sixteen hours a day, but they can only get four or five jiao, or at most eight or nine jiao in pay; working the night shift is even more tiring. When they come back during the day, the children cry and shout, and it is difficult to steal a moment to sleep soundly after taking care of housework. Therefore, here, it is very common and not surprising for girls to flirt and sell their charm to try to earn extra money, and for women to throw their babies into the foundling home where mothers and children can never see each other again. The prosperity of capitalism, which squeezes their blood and sweat, means that in addition to the double burden of housekeeping and raising children, they must dedicate their working time to the factory; unbearable burdens wear them down. Whether in the factory or at home, they are treated as living machines. The women who bear the burden of their children's livelihood, the girls who are favored by the foreman and the nomor wan, are both docile and skilled. Women here almost all have these qualifications.</p>
<p>Women's abilities are strikingly active here! But in terms of status, it doesn't improve because of their strong and capable skills, and because they are the pillars of family livelihood; men still have supreme master authority, all social interactions and recreational enjoyment are mostly for men, and all heavy and tedious burdens are mostly for women.</p>
<p>The spring breeze tenderizes the fields that crisscross the thousands of acres, and it is busy farming season. Working in the lush green vegetable fields, their faces are burned red by the sun, their waists are bent low, agile and light, the edges of the fields are piled with discarded weeds, and the solidified soil is hoed loose. A soft wind teases the headscarves covering their heads. They are as beautiful as a group of butterflies playing in the flowers; majestic and wild like wild horses, they shuttle back and forth busily in the fields; giving people an impression of healthy, lively, and magnificent survivors.</p>
<p>However, the price of vegetables, which is lower year after year, means that their hard work is equal to waste, and there are many who have difficulty living. Often, they shout out their suffocating pain: "Life is bitter..." This unbearable heavy pressure is widely and deeply persecuting the farmers surrounding this prosperous city day by day.</p>
<p>When they are able to receive the clothes that students from schools solicit for washing, it is common to wash seventy or eighty pieces by hand in a day.</p>
<p>Whether it's calling out for business or pushing dung carts... all kinds of labor that are allowed by society, women are working without falling behind.</p>
<p>They are full of energy to create human happiness, but part of their vitality is deprived, and "heroes have no place to use their strength"; part of them exist for the sake of idle men and the burdens of the family; living like stray dogs and horses.——They can never obtain their own happiness in the happiness of mankind!</p>
<p>If their strong life energy had sufficient opportunities for development, would moving mountains and overturning seas be a difficult thing? Who says they can't overturn the subordinate status of women for thousands of years?</p>
<h3>Diary of a Concubine</h3>
<p>— Lulu</p>
<p>March 4th</p>
<p>Yesterday my luck was truly terrible. Just as I was about to win that hand, that cursed whore ruined it. I've been losing continuously these past few days.</p>
<p>The "Director" always says he hasn't been involved with her lately, but why bother arguing with him? What was that ring bought for yesterday? He said it was for the Second Miss's wedding, what a lie! The Second Miss isn't getting married until next autumn, why buy a ring so early? Besides, the Old Mistress doesn't even know about it.</p>
<p>He didn't come back until almost dawn again. Said he was busy with official business! Busy drinking and womanizing! Even that cursed whore can't find him. I wonder what new tricks he's up to.</p>
<p>March 6th</p>
<p>I misunderstood him the day before. According to Mrs. Zhao, they were indeed having a shareholder meeting at the Yangzi Company that day, and no women attended. They just played a few rounds of mahjong among themselves. Besides, he even won money back, so maybe it's true.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, he smoked too much opium, and he hasn't been sleeping well for two nights. If he wants to sleep well, I won't have peace! There's nothing I can do, just like he often tells me: "If you start spending money, I won't have peace." It's no wonder, the doctor said I'm sick, so I'm especially averse to that kind of thing. But if he goes to that cursed whore, I'm really unhappy. What can I do? What do men spend money on women for? I can only...! Alas, Mother used to say: "A blessed woman is one who can please a man."</p>
<p>March 7th</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the Second Miss's mother's death, and the Old Mistress has been making a fuss about holding a vegetarian feast since early this morning. What's the point of making such a fuss? Even if you're more particular, the person is still dead. The "Director" plays around outside every day, and she doesn't even try to control him, always telling people that concubines are bought with money and aren't worth anything. Actually, she used to say the same thing about her daughter-in-law: "Men can always find women easily as long as they have money." Now she's respecting the dead to mock the living. You should know that you're a woman too! Really, what's the difference between marrying and buying? Sleeping with a man using his money is the same thing!</p>
<p>He came back very early this afternoon and stayed in my room the whole time. He probably encountered some unpleasant opponents outside, so he's being so nice to me. He even said he'll take me to the company to buy things tomorrow. But why did he suddenly say I'm too thin and not as attractive as Mrs. Gu Yuanru's chest? I know he's joking with me, but...</p>
<p>March 8th</p>
<p>Mrs. Gu Yuanru ran over early this morning, crying and sobbing, which really scared me. I was still dreaming and jumped out of bed. It turned out she had another fight with Mr. Gu and wanted a divorce. This is almost the same as our Fifth Mistress at home, who wants a divorce at least nine times a year. But before the divorce papers are even drawn up, they're hugging and kissing again. Sure enough, I had just washed my face this morning and hadn't even dried Mrs. Gu's tears when her husband came to pick her up. I heard that another car went to the Jai Alai court that night.</p>
<p>Later, I heard that they were arguing this time because Gu Yuanru wanted to marry another woman. I think if it's true, I should advise Mrs. Gu not to mention the word "divorce." In this kind of world, if a man wants to remarry, it's too easy for him if the woman initiates the divorce. Isn't it good for him if you remove the obstacle? So it's best not to leave, and move out instead, with the man paying for daily expenses.</p>
<p>I think I must visit the Gu's tomorrow afternoon to see what's going on.</p>
<p>March 12th</p>
<p>The Gu's affairs have made me dizzy these past few days. I absolutely do not approve of Mrs. Gu divorcing. Miss Lian is such a strange person. Whenever she encounters such situations, she always advises the woman to divorce. She always says that it's better not to have such a man than to let him mess around. It's better to be poor and live alone.</p>
<p>That's well said, and I often think that way when I'm very angry with those cursed whores. And I even really left once. For example, the time I had that fight with the "Director" the year before last, the nun Master Miao was so eager to persuade me to go to her convent. When I first went, she personally went to the kitchen to prepare vegetarian dishes every day, and she brought her little apprentice, Long Yu, to keep me company. She said, "It's better to become a nun. Involvement in the secular world always brings worries. Besides, to be honest, don't get angry, Madam, but you're almost thirty this year, and your 'Director' has always loved being a playboy and has a lot of money. He might marry one or two at any time. Then your position as wife will still be taken away, won't it? Oh?"</p>
<p>She also said to me, "As long as you sincerely believe in Buddha and have so much money in your own hands, you can live here peacefully in this convent. When I die, everything will be yours."</p>
<p>At that time, I really believed Master Miao's words. But I hadn't even lived there for three months when almost all my things were pawned, and there was no news from the "Director." Then, before Master Miao could even speak, the whole convent's attitude towards me changed. Later, if the "Director" hadn't listened to Secretary Li's persuasion, had a change of heart, and taken me back, I don't know what my fate would have been.</p>
<p>March 13th</p>
<p>I didn't finish writing yesterday's diary because Miss Lian came. As soon as she came, she started talking about Mrs. Gu's affairs. And how scary! It was yesterday afternoon, just as we finished watching the first movie, that she swallowed opium paste! Later, it was Miss Lian's sister-in-law, Miss Gu the Third, who discovered it first! She called Director Wang, saying that her aunt had taken poison, and Director Wang sent an ambulance to take her to the hospital.</p>
<p>When Miss Lian talked about this matter, she still advocated divorce. I took the opportunity to tell her about my experience of entering the convent the year before last. She said that the idea of entering the convent was wrong in the first place. Nuns always cheat people out of their money. Who really wants to help people wholeheartedly? I said that the matter of divorce is wrong in the first place. People in this world always oppress women. Where else can women turn if they don't rely on men! Miss Lian is not married now, and her father has such power. Who wouldn't want to hire a capable daughter? But if she gets married in the future, has children, and circumstances change, and her father is not like he is now, who will she turn to with her children in tow?</p>
<p>Miss Lian didn't say anything after hearing my words. I think she must be in love lately, otherwise why would her emotions change so strangely? When she's happy, she talks so much, and when she's depressed, she doesn't say a word.</p>
<p>March 21st</p>
<p>The Gu's crisis is over. Yesterday, the couple went out shopping hand in hand again, and they even invited us to eat at the Red Plum Restaurant in the evening. It seems that the Red Plum Restaurant specializes in reconciling husbands and wives. The last time our Fifth Mistress and her husband had a fight, the "Director" ended up inviting them to eat at the Red Plum Restaurant and they reconciled.</p>
<p>It's never worthwhile for the woman to take the initiative when a couple argues. People always say that women are petty and love to argue, and they're easily appeased with money. From now on, I will always try my best to avoid arguing. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Philosophy of "Busy"</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huang Ying</p>
<p>Humans are different from pigs. After pigs have eaten their fill, they can sleep in their pen all day without doing anything. But humans can't just eat and sleep without doing anything. A social person who lives in time and space has their energy consumed by changes in space and the progress of time. Due to the constant changes in space and the constant progress of time, human life is also constantly changing and progressing. Therefore, human energy is also constantly being consumed. But this is inevitable. Every second and minute that time progresses, human energy must be consumed accordingly. Because only when humans constantly consume their energy can history progress forward due to human impetus. Therefore, a living social person cannot be like a dead, static object, rigidly occupying a certain space and letting time fly by in vain. They must be active, work, and do things. On the one hand, they are consuming their energy and time. At the same time, on the other hand, they are continuing to live and pursuing the joys of life. If a normal, living person has nothing to do every day after eating, doesn't know how to consume their energy, and just stares blankly as time progresses, then I believe they will be very distressed, even unable to live. We see that those wealthy old masters and mistresses are not able to and don't want to do anything proper, right? But precisely because they have nothing proper to do, they have to desperately engage in those boring activities, such as dancing, gambling, chasing after the opposite sex, playing with dogs and cats, etc., to consume their energy. If you were to tell these wealthy and therefore idle old masters and mistresses not to study equations (play mahjong), not to go to the Jai Alai court and dance halls, not to keep a very human-like dog, and not to pursue sexual stimulation, think about it, where would their energy be consumed? How painful would their spirit be? Furthermore, look at the so-called petty bourgeoisie, aren't there many gentlemen who are called "busy doing nothing"? Actually, it's precisely because they have nothing specific to do, their lives have no center, their spirits have no place to rest, that they have to run around on the streets every day, find friends, brag emptily, and put on a busy-as-hell appearance.</p>
<p>Yes, a living social person is different from a pig that eats its fill and does nothing. They must work and be active in order to consume their energy. But there are many things in the world. Working, doing business, teaching, writing articles are work and things. Gambling, dancing, smoking opium, broadly speaking, are also work and things. Revolution or becoming a traitor can still be said to be work and things. Among these things, which are proper? What should we do in our own life process? Mr. Liang Qichao, in his famous essay "What is the Purpose of Life?", questioned all kinds of people about why they are busy and then said: "Busyness is the duty of life. Look at the great figures of ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, such as Yu the Great, Mozi, Sakyamuni, and some supervising figures, as well as other saints, sages, heroes, and outstanding figures. Which of them would steal leisure for themselves? Which of them were not too busy to warm their seats, unable to be silent, running around in haste, and doing so their entire lives? If one hates busyness and seeks leisure, wouldn't they become mere clothes racks and food sacks? As for talking about hating the world, only the dictionary of a person without ambition has these two words. The sages of ancient times never said such a thing. Please do not misunderstand. What I am saying is to tell you to be busy all day long, busy all year round, but always busy towards a goal. What have you been busy with in the past and present? What is the purpose? Not only do I not know, I'm afraid even you yourself don't know. Not only do you yourself not know, I'm afraid you have never even thought about it since you were born. Alas! Life is impermanent, a human body is hard to obtain. Several decades of cold and heat pass in the blink of an eye. Today's youth, how long will it be before they suddenly become strong and sturdy, suddenly decline and become old, suddenly die unexpectedly, confused and muddled, covered head to toe, wrapped in pus and blood, spending this life like this, isn't it pitiable! Isn't it regrettable! What's more, this kind of purposeless life is bound to be entangled with all kinds of worries and troubles. How can one pass the long night! I advise you to seek the root and investigate the bottom, and come up with a topic, which is to tell you to seek light in the darkness, to teach you to find a place to settle down and establish your life." "Busyness is the duty of life," but we must be busy with a purpose and not waste our energy casually. What is the purpose? It should be to "seek light in the darkness." - This is truly worthy of being the words of a pioneer and visionary! The question of what we should be busy with in the life process and what we should do also has a clear answer in this correct statement: that is, we should be busy seeking light in the darkness, and do things that seek light in the darkness.</p>
<p>We have already stated above that the progress of history depends on the driving force of humanity. If the continuous impetus of humanity to advance history is that humanity is increasingly moving from darkness to light, then the so-called "seeking light in the darkness" in concrete terms is pushing history forward. Therefore, we can say this: "Busyness is the duty of life." People must do things, and promoting the progress of history is the highest principle of our being "busy" with doing things. Under this principle, pursuing low-level entertainment is of course something we should not do. Running around on the streets, bragging, and the so-called "busy doing nothing" are also things that we should consider boring and despise. In our social life, we must contribute our energy to social movements that promote the progress of history and strive to do work that is beneficial to social development. Only in this way can we avoid wasting our energy, and only in this way can we fulfill our "duty of life."</p>
<p>Of course, saying this does not mean that all young students should leave school and all workers and shop clerks should leave their factories and shops... to participate in social movements that promote the progress of history. No. The so-called social movements that promote the progress of history do not unfold in the vastness of space, but arise and develop among the general populace. Therefore, the workplace where people promote the progress of history is in general society and also in their professional lives.</p>
<p>Since the progress of history depends on the driving force of humanity, the size of an individual's contribution to human society is directly proportional to the amount of force they add to promoting the progress of history. But in order for a person to possess a great power to promote the progress of history, they must have the ability to recognize the direction of historical progress and have the observational power to know how the power to promote historical progress works. At the same time, this kind of ability and observational power do not come from talent, but are formed in the life experiences of acquired nature. Therefore, if a person wants to increase their power to promote the progress of history, they must often go among the people to investigate the general actual social situation, and often read newspapers, news, and general theoretical and practical books in order to enrich their knowledge and increase their ability to recognize the objective world.</p>

<h3>Form Creator</h3>
<p>— Qian Ping</p>
<p>In the former warlord era, the offices I stayed in could be listed at great length: county government, tax bureau, police department. However, my work was always the same: "form creator." This wasn't because I liked doing this work, nor because my superiors particularly favored me. It was simply because I was too junior to get any more relaxing position!</p>
<p>The forms I created were mostly about expense reimbursements. No matter what kind of organization it was, it always came down to income and expenses and official travel expenses. It seemed very simple, but when you actually did it, you found it extremely troublesome. On the one hand, your penmanship had to be fast and good, and you had to be proficient with the abacus. If your writing was a little sloppy or your calculations were a little off, that was a big problem. If your own superior discovered it, it wasn't too serious, at most you'd get a mark or a pay cut. But if it was rejected and returned by the higher-ups, even your superior would be reprimanded. All superiors in the world value their reputation and hope to be promoted several levels. For a form creator who ruins their "</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>official reputation" and "official luck," it's really not easy to let them off lightly! Originally, the bottom line of the so-called "four-column ledger" for the income and expenditure of expenses and the salaries of the staff was provided by the accounting department. But they were either relatives or old friends of the superior, and instead ordered us to do their own duties for them. This way, we had two jobs at once, which not only increased the workload but also meant bearing a lot of responsibility!</p>
<p>No matter what kind of organization it was, there was always a definite regulation for official expenses. If you actually spent and reported what you spent, then handling the forms would just be a matter of recording the information. However, in the former warlord era, the problem wasn't that simple. There were even more hidden reasons! Although there were definite regulations for official expenses, spending more meant the superior was responsible, and spending less meant the remainder had to be returned. The superior wasn't a fool, of course they wouldn't spend more and report less. Conversely, they would only spend less and report more. The so-called "reporting more" meant exactly meeting the regulations.</p>
<p>In short, the actual expenditure was minimized by the superior, and the reimbursement form had to be filled out by us form creators so that nothing was left. Doing this tricky work wouldn't be too difficult if we just used our brains to imagine a few numbers and fill them in appropriately under the expense items on the form. However, higher-level organizations were very particular about evidence, meaning that if there was a pen on the reimbursement form, you had to attach an invoice from the stationery store. Heavens, where were we going to find that invoice? The entire reimbursement figure was fabricated, where were we going to find so much evidence? As a result, we form creators had to open stationery stores, rice shops, and coal factories in our minds... take good store names appropriately, go to a seal-carving shop to carve seals, and then ask someone to write out the invoices. Only then was the work considered complete. On the surface, it may not seem difficult, but to fabricate several store names and the value of goods out of thin air, you had to investigate and be familiar with the local situation at least a little to avoid any flaws!</p>
<p>It was even more difficult on the travel expense side. The superior was originally at home and didn't send anyone on a business trip, but every month they still had to reimburse dozens or hundreds of yuan in travel expenses. For example, inspecting river works cost one hundred yuan, investigating murder cases cost fifty yuan... The higher-ups also wanted definite evidence, and a detailed receipt for what hotel you stayed in and what dishes you ate. This way, we had to especially study the geography of that place: how far a certain town was from a certain city, how many hotels there were, and what restaurants there were. Other local customs and practices also needed some investigation. After all the prerequisites were arranged, our bodies as form creators were sitting in the office, but our minds were on a business trip dozens or hundreds of miles away. This wasn't too bad, but what made my head hurt the most was the collection of dish names and the estimation of values, because there were several travel expense reimbursements every month, and each business trip had to be assumed to last three or five days. In order to make the fakes look believable, the dish names were best not to be the same for each meal, and each dish had to be suitable for the local environment. For example, twice-cooked pork is a common dish in Sichuan, but it couldn't be filled in on the reimbursement form of a certain organization in the north. Western food in big cities couldn't appear in small restaurants in towns... This way, we couldn't get a moment of leisure outside the office: on the one hand, we had to investigate the names of dishes, and at the same time, we had to pay attention to their normal values. We couldn't ask the local pretty people about this stupid thing, and we couldn't ask the coolies (they had never been to restaurants at all). We mostly ran to nearby big and small restaurants, recorded the menu, or asked the chefs. After this problem was solved, we slept in bed and carefully considered: in the morning, we should eat a plate of braised pork tripe, and at night, we needed a pot of Huadiao wine and two plates of cold dishes. The next day, the third day, we had to change to a different pattern...!</p>
<p>Therefore, my work in the office was nominally form creation, but in reality, I also had to be a clerk, a merchant, a chef... I couldn't even have a pleasant bowel movement during the day, and I couldn't close my eyes as soon as I got into bed at night. The work was so troublesome, but my salary was at most twenty-four yuan. Although I helped others earn a lot of money, I never received a one or two yuan subsidy. - In fact, I never had such hope at all. I would be lucky if I could keep my job a little longer. But what's strange is that even this small wish often became a fantasy!</p>
<p>Training and Cultivation</p>
<h3>The Way of "Employing People"</h3>
<p>— Heng Yi</p>
<p>The same talent, employed by two different people, because of different methods of use, often leads to different results. How to make people obey, make them accept your ideas, concentrate their efforts, even give their lives, and be willing to work hard, is a question that a businessperson should study.</p>
<p>However, people are living things, not as easy to control as machines. The manipulation of people requires "subtlety," and "natural compliance." Kongming's treatment of Meng Huo, capturing him seven times and releasing him seven times, was nothing more than the influence of virtue. That's why I say that only an unintelligent leader would abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial, failing to make people submit from the root, and instead use the stupid method of "threats" and "inducements" to forcibly win people over.</p>
<p>Experienced businesspersons can generally feel that those who are willing to go through fire and water and give their lives are definitely not because they are paid more during peacetime.</p>
<p>A businessperson who can employ people and knows how to employ people has taken the first step towards the success of their business. Otherwise, no matter how grand your ambitions are, if you only have people tearing down pillars and no green leaves to set you off, then success or failure has already been decided from the beginning. Now let's discuss "how to employ people."</p>
<p>First, you should "deeply understand human nature." At the beginning of employing a person, you must first examine that person's humanity. If this person has admirable qualities, and you want to bring them into your service, then you should give them an attitude of trust in all respects." This is what is called having a discerning eye. You cannot erase their strengths just because they come from a humble background. Everyone has their noble impulses. If they can gain your trust, they will naturally strive to exert their abilities in order to repay your kindness in the future.</p>
<p>The so-called "trust" is definitely not the so-called "laissez-faire." Therefore, those who are good at employing people have an attitude of trust on the surface, but they may still secretly monitor or restrain them. Linking trust and restraint together may seem contradictory on the surface, but in fact, when leading the masses, they are indeed not mutually exclusive and have a synergistic effect.</p>
<p>Second, you must rely on the influence of your personality. I often say that the power of personality to influence people is the greatest. It is enough to make people weep and enough to make people tremble. Just as the ancients said: "Sincerity can move even metal and stone."</p>
<p>If you ask where personality comes from, simply put, personality originates from human nature. Human nature is condensed and expressed in form, and only then does it become a person's personality. A person's personality can never be discovered from just one aspect, nor can it be judged solely on one aspect of their character, and considered a complete expression of their personality.</p>
<p>The ideal personality should first be able to control themselves. Emotions should be governed by reason. The world is a big arena, unpredictable. If you are not an extraordinary person, you cannot respond to extraordinary changes. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen was besieged in Guangzhou, the sound of gunfire was heard outside, but he remained calm as usual. This self-control, which restrains emotions and power, as expressed in his personality, was enough to make his followers admire the greatness of his personality and gain the allegiance of most people. Second, they can be selfless. Third, they can be non-envious. Fourth, they have peaceful integrity. Fifth, they have a cooperative spirit. Sixth, they are not jealous. Seventh, they have a clean example. Therefore, the so-called ideal personality is actually a person's natural prestige.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the way of employing people, one must first have the talent of a leader.</p>
<p>Scientific Business Talk</p>
<h3>A Grand View of the Universe</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Luo Lie</p>
<p>When speaking of the total expanse of cosmic space, even scientists cannot provide a concrete ultimate limit. They can only say that because the existence of matter is infinite, the vastness of the universe is also infinite. Although modern science is very advanced, the portion of cosmic space that it can observe is still very limited, at most only knowing a tiny corner of the universe. However, even this small corner of the finite space that is currently known is so grand and astonishing that merely talking about it can be shocking!</p>
<p>If you stand a mile away from a person who is four or five feet tall, that person will become a black dot, almost impossible to see. This means that a mile is not a short distance; it can shrink a four- or five-foot-tall person into a black dot, so it can be considered a fairly large distance in our direct visual perception. But if you ask how big the Earth is, then its diameter alone is about 7,920 miles. As for its circumference, each degree of latitude is about 69 miles, so multiplying that by 360 degrees gives a circumference of about 24,800 miles. The Earth's mass is 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons, which is sixty trillion trillion tons. In this way, the Earth can be considered a large mud ball suspended in the sky. However, considering just the eight major planets of the solar system, the Earth's volume is 1,300 times smaller than Jupiter's, its diameter is 11 or 12 times smaller than Jupiter's, more than 9 times smaller than Saturn's, more than 4 times smaller than Uranus's, and about 5 times smaller than Neptune's. As for the Earth compared to the Sun, it is even much smaller. The Sun's diameter is 866,400 miles, about 109 times larger than the Earth's, its volume is about 1.3 million times greater than the Earth's, and its weight is 332,000 times heavier than the Earth's. So, it would take almost a million or more Earths to make a single Sun.</p>
<p>The above only discusses the size of the Sun and planets. If we consider the space occupied by the solar system, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is 36 million miles away, the Earth is 93 million miles away from the Sun, and Neptune is 2,797.16 million miles away from the Sun. So, if we consider only the Earth, with its 93 million miles distance from the Sun as the radius and the Sun as the center, drawing a circle (the Earth's orbit around the Sun is an ellipse, not a perfect circle), then the diameter of this circle would be 186 million miles. The Earth travels this circle at an orbital speed of 18 miles per second, taking a year, or about 31,536,000 seconds. Thus, this circle is about 567.64 million miles long. Considering the even more distant Neptune, the orbit it draws around the Sun has a diameter of 5,943.2 million miles, so the size of the space occupied by the solar system is imaginable. In this space, calculating with light traveling at 180,000 miles per second, it takes just over eight minutes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, and then just over four hours and thirty-six minutes to reach Neptune. If light were shot from one end of Earth's orbit to the other, it would take sixteen or seventeen minutes to arrive, and from one end of Neptune's orbit to the other, it would take more than nine hours. If a train traveling at 42 miles per hour were to travel from Earth to the Sun, it would take over 254 years to reach the Sun; and to reach the opposite end of the Earth's orbit, it would take over 500 years. If a cannonball with maximum speed were fired from Neptune, it would take 250 years to reach the center of the Sun, and 500 years to reach the opposite point of Neptune's orbit.</p>
<p>Are the Sun and the solar system considered large then? No, no. The Sun is a giant compared to Earth, but compared to other giant stars, it becomes a dwarf. The space occupied by the solar system is tiny compared to other clusters and nebulae. If we consider the size of the Sun as one unit, then the A star in Lyra is 2.4 times larger; the Y star in Scorpio is 3.2 times larger; the B star in Centaurus is 11 times larger; the A star in Auriga is 12 times larger; the A star in Bootes is 30 times larger; the A star in Taurus is 60 times larger; the B star in Pegasus is 170 times larger; the A star in Orion is 290 times larger; the O star in Hydra is 300 times larger; the A star in Hercules is 400 times larger; the A star in Scorpio is 480 times larger; and one of the brightest variable stars among the two shoulder stars of Orion would require 5,000 times the volume of the Sun to create it. As for stars with a diameter of over one million miles, there are quite a few, and the diameter of a variable star can even reach 300 million miles; the Earth's orbit around the Sun could almost be included within its circumference.</p>
<p>Astronomers divide the stars in the sky into regions for study, each region named after a principal star, becoming a constellation. Currently, there are 68 recognized constellations, and of course, more are still being discovered. Each constellation contains a large number of stars, ranging from thousands or tens of thousands to tens of millions. It is said that the spiral nebula in the Virgo constellation contains millions or even tens of trillions of stars. To calculate the spatial area of various star clusters, nebulae, and their distances in celestial bodies, miles are no longer a suitable unit, and light-years must be used. A light-year is the distance that light travels in a year at a speed of 185,000 miles per second. As we mentioned earlier, the diameter of the solar system's area, if light travels through it, would only take nine months. However, the nearest star outside the solar system, Alpha Centauri, is 25 trillion miles away, requiring 4.4 light-years to reach Earth. Sirius is 50 trillion miles away, or about 9 light-years. Some very distant spiral nebulae are 10 million light-years away because they are 60,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles away from our Earth. Not only that, there are even more distant objects in the sky; their light was emitted 100 million years ago, and only now reaches the eyes of astronomers. This means that astronomy can now observe a spatial distance of 100 million light-years.</p>
<p>Many of the fixed stars in the sky form their own solar systems. The densest place they inhabit is reflected in the sky as the Milky Way, which is 50,000 light-years wide in diameter and 3,000 to 4,000 light-years thick. The starlight from the farthest star on the edge of the Milky Way takes 50,000 years to reach the Earth. Like the aforementioned spiral nebula, its diameter is also 50,000 light-years, but it is only one of the most prominent nebulae in the island universes. In fact, in the visible universe, there are at least 100,000 nebulae. As for the fixed stars in the universe, current scientific estimates are at least 30</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>trillion. From this perspective, in the discovered 100 million light-year universe, there are about 30 trillion fixed stars, and the island universes, where fixed stars are densely packed, have a domain as large as 50,000 light-years. Beyond that, there is the even more distant and sparse sky, which has not yet been explored by modern science and technology. So, in such a great and splendid sea of the universe, humans, compared to them, are probably as small as an electron compared to a ball, which is so amazing!</p>
<p>Art World</p>
<h3>The Objectivity of Art</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Yin Tan</p>
<p>I recently read a work by Ikkoku Kagaku, in which he discussed the difference between art and science, saying that science is objective, while art is subjective. The reason he holds is very simple, because the essence of science is to explain objective facts and laws, which is based on public recognition and universal agreement, and does not differ according to individual subjective feelings and opinions; moreover, facts and laws cannot be selectively chosen and tailored by individuals subjectively, so it is objective. Art is different. Art is about expressing the author's personal feelings, and personal feelings not only vary from person to person but also change all the time. Although art also uses objective things as objects of description, this is arbitrarily chosen by the artist themselves, freely combined and tailored according to their own viewpoints. The author personally organizes it from their own point of view, which they deem beautiful, and the viewer also judges it from their own point of view of beauty and feelings. Therefore, the author cannot simply describe objective facts little by little to create a work of art, and the viewer must also feel that it is beautiful in order to find it beautiful. These are all subjective.</p>
<p>Such a view of art is not only idealistic, but also too superficial and not profound enough in its understanding of art itself. Yes, any artificial product, if viewed from the perspective that it cannot be separated from human effort and the thinking of the brain, has some subjective color, especially all products of intelligence. However, this interaction between subjective and objective only has a parallel form when viewed from the most recent link in the active process of mental production. If we go a step further and ask about the ultimate source of these two opposing things, then objective facts always exist independently in the objective world, and the emergence of subjective thinking also originates from the objective. In this way, there is no independent and self-sufficient subjectivity. If we can understand the relationship between thinking and reality in this way, then the statement that art is subjective and science is objective is incorrect. It is only accurate and truthful to say that art and science are both objective.</p>
<p>For example, if science is about explaining objective facts and laws, then isn't art also based on objective reality? All great works of art must embody a deep objective background in order to become art and express its greatness, and to capture the audience's psychology and move their emotions. Any work without real significance will not have this effect. Idealistic artists and critics believe that a work of art, because it is something that ordinary people have not sensed, and the more it arouses the audience's interest and surprise, the more it is the author's personal spirit that moves people. In fact, the most moving works of art are still those that best depict the things inside reality. In other words, it is either able to highlight the special significance of facts from ordinary facts that ordinary people do not pay attention to, or because it sees certain essences of reality better than ordinary people. However, the so-called facts with special significance and certain essences cannot exist apart from reality. Great artists are able to use extraordinary means to dig out these hidden things to capture the audience's observation, which is precisely where the best depiction of reality lies. Naturally, there are often different societies, resulting in works that embody different realities, and audiences who have different observations of those works, and therefore cannot gain universal support. But to become a great and popular work, it must at least embody the reality of the life of the society to which it belongs in order to be possible. From this point of view, art, like science, is based on reality.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is also incorrect to say that science does not need to be tailored and matched to facts, while art needs to be tailored and matched by the writer's ingenuity. There is also tailoring and matching of facts in scientific research. Because when we study science to formulate laws, we must compare and match many messy phenomena, eliminate some external phenomena that are irrelevant to the topic, and examine which are similar in appearance but not in reality, or which are different on the outside but the same inside. What is tailoring and matching? As for the tailoring and matching of works of art, it is not entirely based on the author's free will; he must also follow objective laws to carry out his work in order to succeed. These objective laws are the laws of nature and society. For example, an artist, when filling in colors in the various combinations of his painting, must match them according to the natural and realistic scenery of the painting. He cannot just paint a pile of ink on a bouquet of flowers, because this does not conform to the beauty of nature. For example, a novel or movie cannot depict a beggar wearing a suit and leather shoes and taking a car to beg for food, because this also does not conform to the laws of social life. In this way, we can clearly see that the artist's work and ingenuity are the same as those of a scientist; they must select materials and choose and match raw materials according to objective laws in order to carry out his organizational and descriptive work.</p>
<p>True, art is about expressing the author's personal feelings, but only idealists believe that the author's personal feelings are personal, innate, self-sufficient, and have nothing to do with the objective. In fact, personal feelings are reflected and cultivated by society. The greater the artist, the more his feelings embody the feelings of society. Society must have coercion, and then there will be feelings of anger and resistance. The more the author's feelings can represent this kind of emotion, the more powerful the work will be to express the feelings of the author and society. The upper class of society must have a pleasant and leisurely life and happy feelings, and the author can create comedy works that represent certain lives. A madman who cannot embody social emotions, although he expresses his power without scruples, cannot be used as the content of any artistic activity. Not only are the personal feelings expressed in great works objective and social, but the feelings of the audience are also social. Works that are completely unrelated to their social public life and social psychology cannot capture their emotions, and they cannot express the same emotions to adapt to, appreciate, and welcome such works. In short, great art is a realistic and objective reflection, just like science. The science of art cannot be separated from reality, and cannot fail to embody reality. Art is also science. The more it embodies reality and organizes and studies art according to scientific methods, the more scientific the art is.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Shanghai Theater Opera Training Institute</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Li Mei</p>
<p>Because I have always loved drama, in the past, as long as there was a good film, I couldn't escape seeing it no matter what. Especially for spoken drama, I have an unspeakable feeling; no matter what kind of theater troupe performs, I always go to admire it with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, the history of China's cultural movement has had commendable achievements, especially in spoken drama and literary creation, which have made great progress, although general art is also evolving in the same way.</p>
<p>However, due to the limitations of time and talent, drama alone has not been able to fully develop. In Europe, the popular and very common opera has remained rarely seen in our theater scene. People are just waiting for it with anticipation.</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have been constantly publishing news about the Shanghai Theater Opera Training Institute. As of today, they have been in class for almost a week.</p>
<p>The emergence of this brand-new thing first attracted my attention and curiosity; and when I learned that only twenty people were admitted out of hundreds of applicants, it aroused my interest in visiting.</p>
<p>One morning, I hailed a rickshaw and happily went to this training institute. As soon as I walked in, they were in class, and their director, Mr. Chen Dabeui, came out to greet me. Under Mr. Chen's enthusiastic reception, I took a small tour. The impression their training institute gave me was very deep.</p>
<p>Twenty Healthy and Beautiful Children</p>
<p>When I first arrived at the training institute, I saw their classroom from outside the window. Twenty people, the women in front and the men in the back, sat in their seats with extreme solemnity and neatness, quietly listening to the instructor's lecture. So silent, no one coughed or said a word. I have spent more than ten years in school and have never seen such good order. So spirited, it is even more rare. I firmly believe that these lovely children are all very healthy. In my expectations, this training institute must be as romantic as ordinary theater troupes, but the facts proved that my speculation was completely wrong.</p>
<p>Their Equipment</p>
<p>It is a foreign-style house that is not small, located on Route Dollfus in the French Concession, diagonally opposite the French Park. As soon as you enter the door, mainly, you know that it is quiet and clean. Not only is it not similar to any theater troupe, it even surpasses the best schools—in cleanliness and order. In addition, in terms of equipment, although this training institute was established not long ago, it is not simple. Inside, there is a small library; they have painstakingly collected all the Chinese translations of world-famous plays, as well as things like principles, ideologies, and historical facts. There are also the latest equipment and facilities for music, dance, and expression.</p>
<p>Exceeded the Original Plan and Ideal</p>
<p>Initially, they planned to enroll a group of students with a secondary school education and gradually impart some knowledge and skills of opera to them. As a result of the enrollment, they were all highly educated, so they had to raise the original plan. This has further increased the interest of the instructors, who are lecturing with energy, hoping that the students will accept knowledge as if they were receiving an injection. After careful inquiry, I realized that each of their professors is a talent with specialized skills and rich experience, especially Mr. Wu Xiaobang. I secretly watched him teach dance, jumping up and down on the table, just like the Monkey King making a big disturbance in the Heavenly Palace.</p>
<p>Living in a Tense and Hard Paradise</p>
<p>This is what I heard from a student. He said: "We came here with determination. We are willing to dedicate our personal lives and souls to the cause of theatrical movement. We are very tough now, and maybe we will be even tougher in the future? But we will always overcome these difficulties with the greatest determination. We have nearly twenty subjects, and we have to take eight hours of classes every day. We don't have much time for rest and entertainment: because when we rest, everyone is doing homework, and entertainment has almost become our work, and work is our only entertainment. Our leg bones ache every day, and we can't go out until Sunday, but all this doesn't make us feel restricted. We dare to be confident: at least in our hearts, our classmates have put the heavy burden of the theatrical movement on their shoulders. ..."</p>
<p>My and Our Hope</p>
<p>The result of the tour was more satisfactory than I expected. I really didn't expect that there would be such a model in the theater troupe. Romance, laziness, and quarrels are absolutely not allowed in this training institute; it has all the characteristics of ordinary theater troupes: perseverance, hard work, and unity. Moreover, those twenty children are healthy, lively, brave, and loyal. The equipment is so complete: the professors are also very familiar; under such circumstances, we are wishing it future success.</p>
<p>Here, we silently pray for the success of the opera movement!</p>

<h3>Night of Fishing</h3>
<p>— You Ren</p>
<p>I love the countryside, especially living in the countryside; because there are unforgettable mountain peaks, water edges, verdant pine forests, and tranquil fields that can make me feel happy everywhere. Even the simple and robust song of the farmers, "When the sun rises, we go out to work; when the sun sets, we come back to rest," sounds more beautiful to me than whatever "Little Baby, Go to Sleep" is broadcast by the city's radio station. Even if I live in the countryside forever, I won't say things like "annoying" or "boring" as I would in the city. Country life makes me comfortable everywhere; especially fishing, which is a peculiar habit of mine. Every time I go fishing, it always makes me linger and forget to return.</p>
<p>It was an autumn evening. The rain had just cleared, and my cousin and I stood on a high earthen embankment, admiring the ever-changing white clouds and the jade-like bright moon. At this time, the herdboy's song of returning home after the rain, together with several fishermen's songs sent from afar, rang crisply and gracefully throughout the universe of nature, making me feel an unparalleled sense of beauty. My soul, unable to resist the lure of the songs, sang fishing songs as well. I wanted to go fishing, so I clung to my cousin, urging him to leave the high embankment and go home. Unable to withstand my pestering, my cousin had to agree. I was extremely happy! So we went home and quickly gathered our fishing gear—fish baskets, fish scoops, and raincoats and hats. After my cousin had folded the net, we went fishing together.</p>
<p>The earth was silent. Because of the rain, some farmers had already gone to sleep and rest; others were prevented by the rain from returning home. The old cow under the grass shed was sighing deeply; the little dog in front of the house was barking "Woof, woof" every now and then. There were few pedestrians on the road—almost no one. After walking a long way, we finally ran into Liu Er, a neighbor, carrying his farm tools home.</p>
<p>Walking further, we vaguely saw Xiao Shi driving two fat yellow oxen—they were pulling a "water cart," hurrying home. The road was muddy, and the cart was creaking. The oxen were panting, and Xiao Shi was still scolding them! The crack of a whip stirred the air on the earth from silence to excitement.</p>
<p>We met Xiao Shi, and mud splashed from under the cart.</p>
<p>"Just going home?" The enthusiastic question came out of my mouth again.</p>
<p>"Yes, because of the rain, I haven't finished working on the two acres of land!" He then said, "It's autumn now, and the river water is newly fallen. Where are you going fishing? You really have nothing to do! Aren't you afraid of getting sick from the cold water? Let's go home together!" Looking at the tools we were carrying, he guessed that we were going fishing; at the same time, he was concerned that the autumn rain had just fallen, and the night water was even colder, as if afraid that we would get sick from the rain, so he tried to stop us. But my cousin and I continued to move forward. Walking, walking, after turning a few bends, we stopped on a small bridge next to a clump of reeds. My cousin put the net down under the bridge and stood there silently. I spread out my raincoat and lay down on it. Quietly, as if expecting something.</p>
<p>The reeds by the bridge swayed in the night wind. The nearby sorghum stalks and soybean plants grew deeply, and although there was bright moonlight shining down, it still felt a bit gloomy. The frog drums in the fields were drumming particularly vigorously after the rain. At this time, I enjoyed the beautiful scenery before me, as if I had forgotten everything. Suddenly, I looked up and saw my cousin still standing there holding the net rod, motionless. The ripples on the water were illuminated by the moonlight, and the moon in the water also clearly showed a moving appearance. I had just recited the line "Water and sky, two moons, bright above and below." My cousin quickly said, "Don't sing, you'll scare the fish away!" At this time, all my attention turned to the net in my cousin's hand. The net was lifted, and water slid down from the net like silver threads. The ripples on the water surface spread outwards in circles. In the moonlight, they looked like ten thousand little white gold dragons swimming in a green glass bottle! After the water had dripped off, the net was empty! I was a little puzzled, why weren't there any fish in the net? Suddenly, I thought: Maybe we just arrived? Instantly, my heart returned to its previous calmness. The net was lifted, one net after another, but not even a shadow of a fish was seen!</p>
<p>"Are there no fish after the new rain?" I asked my cousin.</p>
<p>"Yes, wait a moment." My cousin was not in a hurry at all! He put the fishing net into the water again. The earth was even quieter, and the wind carried the night talks of two or three fishermen from nearby.</p>
<p>"Ah! Other people are also fishing! Perhaps the fish have been caught by them?" I asked my cousin again.</p>
<p>"No way, 'fish pass through a thousand nets'... Give me my tobacco pouch so I can smoke a pipe!" My cousin answered me while asking me to pass him the tobacco pouch. I thought that smoking could catch fish, so I hurriedly filled the pouch and handed it to my cousin. The net was lifted again, but still "empty"! The night wind increased in gusts, and I felt shivering because I was wearing thin clothes; but because I had desperately wanted to come, I had no choice but to endure it in silence. I hunched over, standing motionless and staring blankly at the net. Because I hadn't seen any fish for a long time, my eyes sometimes unconsciously wandered to the distant night scenery.</p>
<p>Continued on the fifth page</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Finally, everything in the distance gradually became blurred. The moon was about to set! I was getting anxious when suddenly, my cousin said, "Fish are coming from afar, you can hear the sound of fish tails by the river." My cousin pulled back my infatuated eyes and turned them towards the net. Sure enough, I heard a gurgling sound in the water, and the fishing net was trembling greatly. Then, a fish was caught! "Quick!" It was my cousin's urgent voice. At this time, I panicked and forgot about the cold. I hurriedly grabbed the fish basket, didn't even take off my clothes, and jumped into the river with a splash.</p>
<p>"I told you not to rush, 'ten years without a market, when there is a market, eat for ten years.' Look at this fish, it weighs more than five catties!" My cousin shouted triumphantly. Looking at the big fish in his hand, the scales shone brightly in the moonlight, and I felt an indescribable joy in my heart. I just kept smiling. I didn't climb back onto the bridge, but just stood by the net. After that, the net was lifted, one net after another, and big fish, small fish, carp, crucian carp... one after another, we caught half a basket.</p>
<p>Before long, the Moon Sister went down the mountain, and two or three rooster crows came from the village. The dark shadows under the bridge gradually faded, and the clumps of reeds appeared even darker. "Let's go back, we can't see clearly." My cousin seemed tired and urged me to go back, so we left the clumps of reeds. Ah! The fish basket was really heavy. I couldn't walk as fast as when I came! The fish, big and small, were jumping around in the net. The basket on my back was a bit uneasy. It was hard to find my way home.</p>
<p>But, the next day, those jumping fish, ah, had already been stiffly burned to death in the pot! You poor fish! People's laughter is built on your deaths! At this time, I suddenly thought of our current China, our current China is like the fish on the line of death!</p>

<h3>Recent News from Meihua Girls' High School</h3>
<p>Meihua Girls' High School at No. 61 Kade Road has been practical and realistic in everything since its establishment. Recently, it has increased the purchase of books and added various specimens of animals and plants, making the facilities even more complete. In terms of sports, a basketball court has also been added for serious training, so that students can get in-depth training in physical education.</p>
<p>Good News for Learning Esperanto</p>
<p>Esperanto has been introduced to China for more than twenty years. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Esperanto Association (now in Yongping Lane, Kade Road), the number of students has increased dramatically in the past three years due to the association's active promotion. It has held many training courses, cultivating nearly a thousand Esperanto talents. It is now heard that the eleventh session has started last Tuesday evening, and there are still some vacancies. Those who are interested in learning can contact the association. It is also learned that the association traveled to Suzhou during the spring vacation, and many people participated.</p>
<p>Vocal Basic Exercises Published The new curriculum standards for junior high school music recently promulgated by the Ministry of Education stipulate that more than ten minutes of pronunciation exercises must be conducted before teaching singing, but this standard has not been sold in the market for a long time since its promulgation. Mr. Qiu Menghen, a giant in the music industry in this city, has compiled a book of vocal music basic exercises based on his ten years of teaching experience and based on this standard. The teaching materials are sufficient for the three academic years of junior high school, and the teaching methods are explained in detail in the examples. It is a good textbook for junior high school music lessons. It has now been published and sold by Kaiming Bookstore on Simalu Road, Shanghai. The price is only 25 cents per copy. The Chengzhong, Lida, Aiguo, Xinmin, Guangdongdong; Fushi, Shangzhong, Ji Shi, Dazhong, Minzhi, Huzhong, and Hangzhou Jinan Suzhou and other middle schools in this city have all adopted this book.</p>

<h3>Decline (1)</h3>
<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>It only takes a day to get from Shanghai to my hometown; there are trains and ships to take, and the road is not lonely. In terms of convenient transportation, it is indeed worthy of my gratitude. The day I arrived home was the evening when the rural customs were busy with "sending off the stove god." If it were today five years ago, the whole village would have been filled with a festive mood. However, what was reflected in my eyes on this day was only a dead village; in front of every earthen brick wall, there was a quiet and desolate scene.</p>
<p>The piercing north wind pushed the fallen leaves on the ground, swirling in the open space of the rice threshing ground, making a rustling sound like water泻. My porter and I walked silently, and hearing that kind of reverberating sound of leaves, I couldn't help but think that this was a harbinger of a decline in the countryside!</p>
<p>From the wharf to my home, there was a distance of three miles. My porter and I walked in this hazy night. We passed through more than a dozen villages in the middle, and each village showed a decadent appearance like anemia. Finally, we stepped on the edge of our village; the village where I grew up and haven't seen for five years, everything I saw at this time was only more extraordinarily old!</p>
<p>The entire village was immersed in the dark night, and for a moment, I couldn't find my own home; my porter and I groped around the village, and only by using the power of lighting match after match, could we recognize that there was a stone for tethering cattle at the gate of my house!</p>
<p>A few hours of running around reduced my strength to talk when meeting family members!</p>
<p>"Young master! Young master! Why are you back so late?" The servant Afu opened the door. Suddenly seeing my unfamiliar face that he hadn't seen for several years, he didn't dare to believe that I would come back at this time; he used the light emitted from the house, opened his eyes, and carefully looked around on my face for a while, before shouting at me the title he had shouted at me a few years ago.</p>
<p>"Hmm! Help me take the things in, Afu!" Extreme exhaustion made me only coldly perfunctorily deal with Afu's excited expression.</p>
<p>"Young master! You go inside first. I'll move these things." He still greeted me so warmly.</p>
<p>"Okay, no rush; are they all in the back?" Afu's enthusiastic touch made me understand that this time I couldn't help but speak in this environment.</p>
<p>Afu moved the things into the hall one by one, and without even breathing a sigh, he rushed ahead of me to the back, still chanting urgently in his mouth: "Young master is back! Young master is back!"</p>
<p>Hearing Afu's enthusiastic shouting, I couldn't help but feel a burst of shame in my heart!</p>
<p>The family members were all led out by Afu's shouting; the doorway of the "ancestral hall" was crowded with many gloomy faces of men and women, but when our lines of sight met, a kind of indescribable smile was piled on each face. Looking at the family's warm welcoming mood, I couldn't think of a single beautiful word to give them some comfort!</p>
<p>The "ancestral hall" was cold and ordinary, and none of the things that should have been placed during the New Year were placed at this time. A thick cobweb was hanging on the "insurance lamp" hanging in the middle of the hall, swinging in the air with the wind; I had just stepped into the "ancestral hall" and was stunned for a while by these many unpleasant scenes. The lively scene of five years ago unconsciously climbed into my heart again.</p>
<p>Seeing my strange behavior, the family members all just stood blankly in front of me, and no one seemed to have thought of what questions they should ask this unfamiliar person who had been away for five years. I turned around and glanced at them, and then I realized that one of the leading figures of my family was missing from this crowd.</p>
<p>"Where did Dad go? Why isn't he home yet, Mom?" I walked to my mother's side, stroking her shoulder and asking. I only saw that the black hair on her head had also turned into a pale color with the passing of time.</p>
<p>"He went to town, probably he'll be back soon? Haven't you eaten yet, Kun'er!" She forced a little smile on her face, and her hands frequently touched my face, her attitude seeming so unnatural.</p>
<p>When I asked these words, they all suddenly looked startled, and exchanged glances with each other in frustration. But in an instant, they all focused their gazes on my mother's face, and everyone stood there naturally with gray eyes, seemingly feeling a kind of panic that a misfortune was about to befall between my mother's opening of her lips.</p>
<p>"Isn't it going to be 'sending off the stove god' tonight? What did Dad go to town to do?"</p>
<p>Judging from the expressions on many people's faces, I guessed that my father's trip to town was definitely not as simple as my mother said.</p>
<p>"Yes, he went to town to buy things for 'sending off the stove god.' Kun'er! You eat first, and Dad will be back in a while." My mother glanced at them, and then shouted: "Afu—go tell Third Aunt to get food for the young master!"</p>
<p>The wrinkles on my mother's forehead were piled up thickly like the folded canvas on a boat, and a wave of doubt shifted on those deep wrinkles; but she still looked at me with so much pretense of calmness, seemingly wanting to find a little comfort in this face of mine that had been taken away from the childhood plumpness by the wandering life.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Courtship"</p>
<p>The sun sets on Coal Mountain, is there a shadow or not. A beautiful girl admires herself in the mirror, tidying her hair. Suddenly in the mirror, she sees her lover arrive. With delicate fingers, she arranges her temples. She stands up and puts down the comb. Hastily, she pulls on her sleeve. She calls out "Brother, please sit down. Sit beside me and keep me company. Why haven't you come lately? I suspect you have a beautiful girl elsewhere." The lover listens and rubs his hands. "I thought you women were too talkative. Last time I wanted to see you, but there were too many sisters in your house. I previously asked for your birth date, but your father didn't agree. What to do? Today I received a letter from the study. Your father is sending you away to marry another. It scared me to death!" "Miss, fate is determined from a past life. If we don't have the blessing in this life, then let it be. I can only shave my head and chant Amitabha." The lady listens and laughs, "You have wasted your studies; you have no talent. Wait until I get married, and come visit me before the full moon. If my husband asks who you are, just call yourself a cousin. And I will call you cousin."</p>

<h3>Madge Evans Dislikes Her Acting Ability Being Too Broad</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>According to the current star system, an individual's success largely depends on the development of his personality. The expression of his personality, now on the screen, is what is commonly known as style. Once a movie star's style has become unique and recognized by the audience, it is often difficult to change. Therefore, apart from many established stars who already enjoy a unique status through their unique style, many aspiring but not yet famous actors are most afraid of being classified into a certain style or category. This is probably because once categorized, job opportunities become fewer and the path to success narrows.</p>
<p>This is the general sentiment of ordinary film actors. They do not want to be placed in a narrow category. They want to be called versatile geniuses. They like to hear people praise them as versatile actors. However, for the sake of exploring the film industry, we must introduce a female actor who is known as versatile, but has been harmed by her versatility and continues to play secondary roles.</p>
<p>Madge Evans is also a very famous star. She has soft yellow hair, slightly golden, light blue eyes, and an extremely beautiful posture. She is a versatile actor who can do anything. In the past four years, she has acted in thirty-four films, and recently played the important role of Agnes in "David Copperfield," which can be considered a lot of work. However, she is still a secondary actor, although she is the best among the secondary ones.</p>
<p>Why? According to her own discovery, it is because her performance range is too broad, and it is too easy to play any role, so she has not yet been recognized by the film production authorities and the audience as belonging to which category. She dislikes her own versatility and would rather succeed in a unique style and show off her expertise.</p>
<p>Madge said: "An actress is usually limited and becomes a certain style. But when a certain style needs a certain actor, she is immediately selected. As a result, what she gets is recognition and success. For example, Garbo is limited by her figure (square shoulders), face (high cheekbones), and voice (coarse and hoarse), and has become a foreign style, suitable for performing mysterious and seductive girls. She occupies the top spot in this category, and no one can compete with her.</p>
<p>"The rest are also the same. Joan Crawford, Katharine Hepburn, Ann Harding, Constance Bennett, Mae West, they each have their own personality, expertise, style, and category, and they are not confused with each other. Whether in the eyes of producers or audiences, they are all unique and forever so. Therefore, when it comes to the most important role casting, their suitability and ability have long been recognized by the directors, and they naturally assign important roles to them.</p>
<p>"But what about me? The remaining inconspicuous, meaningless roles have my name written on them. They know that I can do anything and look like anything. So whether it is the daughter of a physical education teacher in a football film, a British noblewoman in a social film, a female entrepreneur in New York, or a Chinese nanny, when they lack suitable actors, it is my opportunity to perform. I have been playing random roles for a long time now. To keep myself from being too disappointed, I would rather break this environment and be recognized by people in a certain style."</p>
<p>This broad acting ability was initially a welcome asset, but it gradually made her tired. However, a genius like Madge Evans probably won't let her be disappointed in the end, right?</p>
<h3>Review of "The Fugitive"—Jin Cheng</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>In today's era when upright gentlemen lament the decline of national spirit, "The Fugitive," which appears with a positive anti-imperialist and anti-Japanese stance, is being released at this time, which seems to be a cup of bitter wine for the vast audience deeply mired in national destruction and family ruin. This bitter wine makes people cry and shed tears, and at the same time makes people roar with boiling blood.</p>
<p>After watching it, this film is written like this: In the poor and peaceful northern border region, the planes of imperialists cruelly bombed their hometown. Their parents, children, were sacrificed under the bloodbath, so the survivors fled with the old and the young. In the vast and boundless desert, in hunger, thirst and wind and sand, they struggled on the line of death. Flee, flee painfully and cry out, but where is their hometown? Where is their home? They died under the imperialist bombs, and also died from hunger, thirst and disease. However, rich young masters took the opportunity to abduct homeless girls, and some cunning profiteers buried greedy old men in the desert in order to sell people, while the girls were transferred to the hands of lustful perverts. At the same time, on the other hand, there were so-called big-bellied capitalist philanthropists, who profited from the good name of sheltering refugees, indulging in their own enjoyment of embezzling donations, while the refugees got thin porridge that they could not eat enough of, and slept in dirty hard houses, making the young masters smell the unpleasant stench. They groaned and endured in a life of whipping and cursing, until they could no longer endure it, they finally roared! They finally recognized who their greatest enemy was. In order to recover their lost land, to return to their hometown, and to escape from the line of death and struggle to survive, they used agricultural tools such as hoes as weapons. In the majestic marching music, they shouted slogans to recover the lost land and made the final fight against imperialism. As mentioned above, "The Fugitive" has its great significance when it is released at present.</p>
<p>Yes, the screenwriter's intentions are good. He dares not go with the flow of singing and dancing for peace, and he has not forgotten that the Chinese people are in a national crisis of dire straits. With the greatest enthusiasm for national salvation, he uses film art to arouse the ambition of the common people to resist, to restore the broken mountains and rivers through effective national war, and to seize the existence of the free position of the Chinese nation. However, in terms of creative methods, this is not a perfect artistic work. At least in terms of performance techniques, there are still many places that deserve to be brought up and discussed with the screenwriters and directors. At the same time, there are also many excellent scenes that are worth mentioning to introduce to the audience.</p>
<p>What moves us the most is that the author tightly grasps the audience's sad emotions with cruel depictions. He made Qin Tong buried in the sand, only showing his head and neck. We have seen the same scene of burying serfs alive in Eisenstein's "Storm Over Mexico" and were greatly moved by it. Now that Qin Tong is buried in the desert, although the author did not explicitly tell us whether he was buried alive or buried after death, the degree of cruelty deeply stimulates the audience's hearts. Similarly, in the refugee shelter, the refugees who could not grab porridge to eat were also whipped. As for the various escapes in the desert, the death of Shao Ying's uncle, the injury of his father, and Shao Ying's burial of the young girl left behind by his uncle, all made the audience shed tears sadly.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people feel that the scenery of the northern border is not described sadly and desolate enough, but the pastoral mood at the beginning, the wailing of the sheep, the sad flute sound, the gray sky and the desolate land, are somewhat like lyrical poems. As for the vast desert, with wind and sand blowing, and the refugees suffering from hunger and thirst, this deep sadness, compared with the bitter rain and cold wind in the south, is a completely different kind of bitterness.</p>
<p>In "Rage of the China Sea," we have already appreciated the author's quite powerful performance of mass scenes. Similarly, the bombing by the imperialist planes, the fire, the shouts and running of the masses, which are the highlights of the play here, are even more powerful when compared with the bustling worship of gods that immediately follows. As for the fight scene later, it is also passable.</p>
<p>But at the same time, there are also many shortcomings. The most important thing is that in terms of screenwriting methods, it is impossible to gradually improve the activity of this group of anti-imperialist resistance, and we even only see the bloodbath of imperialism, but do not see any expression of their intuitive hatred for the enemy. Therefore, the anti-Japanese war led by Shao Ying later only felt like a sudden and reluctant tail added on. In fact, the refugees' anti-Japanese war is a decided way out, but the author avoids the important and takes the light and cannot grasp the inevitable process.</p>
<p>Another major shortcoming is the poor understanding of weaving methods in the directorial method. We see that many places are not connected. It is almost taking care of one thing and losing the other, writing the stories separately, and not being able to weave them together intricately. Naturally, it also contains many screenwriting errors; such as Xiao Yun's mistaken entry into the young master's house and Shao Ying's finding her, are both coincidental uses. As the Shao Ying siblings did not know that the third girl was also in the room, they actually uncovered her quilt in a tense scene, and even the process of the third girl's suicide all prove that the director's handling was inappropriate. Although these are all shortcomings of the script, the director is not unable to remedy them.</p>
<p>What I want to say again is the author's tone for the whole play. Because the scenery of the northern border uses too few long shots, (such as Yuan Meiyun's singing is always a panning shot.), so that it cannot give us a deeper sense of desolation. Sometimes the tone of the play is too slow, especially some panning shots are too slow, which makes people feel stagnant and dull. As for inserting extremely slow caressing of corpses and painful crying into the air of fighting, it certainly destroys the tense air.</p>
<p>People may be moved by the activeness of its theme, and feel that these technical details do not need to be demanding, but with good intentions, but not being able to express them more skillfully and deeply, this makes the activeness of the content also lose its great social value; although the form is not enough to express the content, it is a common problem of China's emerging films. However, we will not ignore the difficulties in creating the environment for Chinese films. The most obvious thing is to replace the words "Japanese imperialism" with "them," which shows the author's painstaking effort to avoid the important and take the light.</p>
<p>The acting, set design, and songs all have better results, but the dubbing has not yet been selected to a perfect level. Due to space limitations, other details are omitted.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Gilded Lily"</h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>The Gilded Lily—Grand Theater Screening</p>
<p>Continuing the current most popular style of American films, "The Gilded Lily" fully expresses the light and humorous mood. It gives us pleasure from beginning to end, and deeply portrays the personality of the characters in the play in this lightness and humor. For example, the male protagonist Pete is so unruly and unrestrained that he must take off his shoes in the park, and sometimes forgets to wear shoes and walks barefoot on the ground. This kind of place makes people laugh, and at the same time feel that he has a lovely personality. Similarly, the female protagonist Marilyn, the first time she sang and danced in a nightclub, she forgot the lyrics, she felt very embarrassed, but she was very humorous and witty, and cleverly supported the embarrassing situation. Of course, she is not mischievous, but it gives you a very innocent and lovely impression. These places show the ingenuity of the director or actors, and more importantly, the youthful and lively charm of the screenwriter, as the basis for success.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the screenwriter is very experienced and has a cold-eyed philosophy of life, which is used as a positive transmission on the male protagonist. He is very satisfied with his profession, does not desire or demand too much, sits quietly in the park with his lover on Thursday to eat plums and talk casually, enjoying himself. Even when proposing to his lover, he is not reluctant. If they can get married, they will get married, otherwise, it doesn't matter if they wait for a while, he doesn't care. But he understands that women are not easy to completely get rid of the desire to improve their lives, and even make him lose love. But this cannot be forced, it is better to let it develop naturally. So when he knew that his lover was admiring the son of an English earl, although he had jealousy, he did not throw the photo of his rival on the ground twice? He still shrugged and put it back in place. Not only that, he was also happy to accompany his lover to visit his rival (the earl's son). Until the lover realized that the young master did not have true love for her, he did wait for her to return to him.</p>
<p>However, this is only a love comedy, and apart from the portrayal of love, there is no more important reflection of reality. We are not demanding at all; for example, in the United States, which is extremely trapped in social chaos and unemployment panic, the male and female protagonists would never be as settled and happy as the screenwriter wrote, right? This cannot but be a whitewash of consciousness.</p>
<p>Yes, here I just want to create a light comedy. In order to obtain a graceful and sweet mood, both the director and the actors are more than competent. Perhaps it can be said that Wesley Ruggles will not have the humor of Lubitsch or Capra, "The Gay Divorcee" or "Midnight," but Wesley Ruggles is by no means a failure. For example, when Marilyn suddenly bid farewell to the earl's son in England and packed up to return to China, those reporters were quickly taking pictures, which can prove his quickness. But when Marilyn and the earl's son are talking about love on the beach, the bare feet that come and go as a moving background are too many, and become a minor flaw. Claudette Colbert's acting skills are best displayed in this kind of light film, and it seems to be far above those ancient palace films. As for the male lead, he is naturally also very successful.</p>

<h3>The Hate of a Fallen Indian Nation (Clive of India) (8)</h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>Clive said, "But, my dear, our money is all gone. We don't have a single penny." Margaret heard her husband's words and, although startled, felt even more distressed, but she comforted him, saying, "But we still have each other, don't we?" As she spoke, she suddenly noticed a change in his expression and asked in alarm, "What's wrong?" Clive shifted uneasily, and after a moment said, "A blessing in disguise is that just as this bad news arrived, the East India Company sent someone to invite me to go. They want me to go to India again. Imagine!"</p>
<p>Margaret asked eagerly, "And then?" Clive said, "I have to leave tomorrow. It's extremely urgent. After tomorrow, I'll have to wait several weeks for another ship." After he finished speaking, the two fell silent, their thoughts surging, and they couldn't speak for a moment. Margaret felt a powerful force that, after uniting them as husband and wife for several years, was now about to tear them apart, and even take their son away. Although she appeared calm, her heart was in utter disarray, but she tried her best to think about which path was best.</p>
<p>When Clive spoke, he naturally hoped that Margaret would go with him. She thought that if she accompanied her husband to India, they were both young, Clive was only twenty-five, and after a few years they would still return to England. At that time, everything would surely be restored to its former glory, houses, children, money, endless happiness. But she also thought that no matter how rich and honorable they became in the future, their first beautiful dream had already vanished. They could have children in the future, but their current child would never return.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she couldn't help but feel grief. She felt that she absolutely could not follow her husband to India. She had to stay with her son until he died. She wanted to cherish the remaining unfulfilled dream in her heart, even though she knew it couldn't last long. Finally, she made up her mind and told him Lord Ferris's words. Clive was stunned for a long time after hearing this, staring at Margaret's face. He then asked, "Really? Really… is there no hope at all?" When Margaret remained silent, only lowering her head, he also whispered, "Child…" and couldn't say another word.</p>
<p>After a while, Clive finally spoke, "Don't remember what I said. Of course, you can only stay here. In a mother's heart, of course, her son comes first." He stood up and walked to the upstairs nursery, which Clive had specially decorated for his son. He asked, "Can I see him now?" Margaret nodded. Clive said again, "Go and tell the servants to pack my luggage." With that, he went upstairs.</p>
<p>Margaret called the housekeeper, Miss Cripps, and instructed her to pack Clive's luggage. As she was about to leave, Margaret stopped her again. Miss Cripps hurried back, but Margaret was silent for a long time, unable to speak. Finally, she said, "Pack my things too, and put them together. I'll come up and help you in a bit." Miss Cripps couldn't help but wonder, "But… madam… what about the child…"</p>
<p>Margaret quickly stopped her, "Never mind! Pack the luggage! I'm telling you to pack the luggage! Pack the luggage!" Miss Cripps, seeing the miserable and impatient look of her mistress, silently retreated. After Miss Cripps left, Margaret thought that no matter what, she had to accompany her husband to India. Her son could be cared for by servants and treated by specialists until he passed away, but her husband had no one to comfort him or discuss matters with except her. (To be continued)</p>
