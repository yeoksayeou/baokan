<h3>河北事件　外報論調一斑</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　泰晤士報社論謂北平與東京傳　之消息已明白表示日本軍閥已戰勝廣田與外交家、如廣田謀取中日諒解之志願不盡為徒具形式之諒解、則廣田定必因此大為不安、而中國政治家之認對日友好為中國復興所必要者、亦必深感不寗矣日本此種軍事之進取、亦不能減少他國在遠東有關係者之焦慮、彼等將以為日本軍人將為其所欲為、日本軍人對於其自己的外務省及其他行政機關、大有以檢査員自命之意云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　每日捷報今日社論謂、日本之在實際上兼併華北最重要省分、乃四年前日本奪取瀋陽時開始的政策之必有賡續、此種舉動在四年前不難制止之、但當時英政府對於日本第一次俊略予以默認、英國執政者前抱日人為我驅逐赤黨之觀念、暗自欣喜今則見日本向南推進、而以驅逐英國在華貿易與勢力為目的、乃為之惶遽不寗、而當道乃有派羅斯爵士前往南京考察經濟情形、希圖挽回潮流之舉云、</p>
<p>彙聞報稱、英政府之遣羅斯爵士前往中國也無疑地表示英政府於時局危險、及英國在此時局中艱危命運之若干惶恐、但今已太晚矣、中國現處之地位、不能接受一方以外之任何方面之勸吿矣、此事在中國固極嚴重、然在西方諸國、其嚴重亦僅捎遜耳、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　右派機關報白日報、社會黨機關報人民報、均批評中日兩國間現行糾紛、白日報謂、「日本卽使佔領北平城、而此城所屬國籍、尤其是中國國家、並不因此而趨於滅亡、西方人以為中國正在式微中、實乃想像過甚之詞、抑知中國歷史、充滿混亂分崩、曁異族入主之事實、而每經一次患難之後、中國輙能發揮其力量、光復故國、再度出現於歷史、非徒無損其毫末、且能舉戰勝者而同化之、不觀於突厥蒙古滿洲人歟、此輩雖曾入主中國、但卒為中國人所克服、安知日本不步此輩後塵、而為中國所制歟、」人民報載稱、「日本所為、乃依據該國前首相田中義一一九二七年奏摺所主張之計畫、而推行一種大亞細亞門羅主義、以為一已之利、國聯會之孱弱無能、實乃歐洲各國孱弱無能、第一次之表現、日本乃乘機悍然為之、無所顧忌、嗟夫」云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　報紙對於河北中日局勢、批評頗多向來對日友好者、今亦對於日本在河北、舉動表示憤懣、（十一日路透社電）孟却斯德指導報今日社論、謂日本陸軍之行為卽日本之所為無所反顧、日本對華僅有一個政策、卽一九一五年二十一條要求之政策、並不因日本屢次所　之　論而變更此種行為除俄國外、東西各國似未有能制止之者、（十一日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>法內閣更迭之意義</h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>法國議會對於政府事無巨細罔不干涉。不類英國會之衹定大政方針。而任內閣負責執行。政務方面。儘有伸縮之餘地也。頃法總理富蘭亭蒲伊。松以維護法郎平衡預算等問題。急不容緩。一再向國會要求財政全權。雖以十月底為期。然此屬蠣常舉動。影響政府與國會間之根本關係。議員諸公自不廿輕易予政府以此項全權。內閣之相繼傾覆。原無足怪。</p>
<p>法國人民愛自由重民治。故國會之中。議員之政治思想與利害觀念。異常參差。形成黨派林立之局。自極右之帝制派至極左之共產黨。得以雜處一堂。政府方面欲組新閣。其複雜玄妙如拼七巧板。鈎心鬥角。茍能撮合若乾黨之利害。以取得國會中之臨時多數者。則內閣成。否則牽一髮可動全身。此法國內閣不穩定之癥結。粗具政治學常識者。類能道之賴伐爾今茲羅致急進社會黨·社會黨·新社會黨·左翼共和黨·左翼民主黨·共和民主黨·及中央共和黨人物。組成所謂左翼共和黨內閣。竟使富蘭亭蒲伊松因以失敗之財政全權案。安然通過參眾兩院。推原其故。蓋法國會內左中各黨。惕於外間輿論之不能再忍。及帝制派共產黨之踴躍欲試。不得暫將監督財政之權利。賦予政府。以避免當前切迫之禍害。賴伐爾本其盤望應時制宜。稍展其政治手腕。遂得臻水到渠成之局。</p>
<p>吾人於此得一概念焉。即法內閣與議會間之關係已無形修正。是據一八七五年之憲法。法國總統得參院之同意。原有解散國會之權。惟自一八七七年為帝制派總統穆克麻宏一度濫用失敗後。五十餘年來。此法已成廢文。法內閣因不能如英內閣之得解散國會。故英法民治。有內閣制與國會制之別。然吾人鑒於去年一二月間巴央納市之史達維斯基舞　巨案所掀起之政潮。達拉策旭丹內閣相繼傾覆。直至七十老翁之退任總統杜萬格出山。案情翕服。始得組成所謂政黨休戰內閣。最近金融恐慌。又造成類似之閣潮。富蘭亭蒲伊松內閣均不安於位。迄賴伐爾再作馮婦。卒成所謂過渡內閣。先後二事可證法國組閣問題。茍至山窮水盡之境。國會方面不得不與之妥協。否則國會可隨意倒閣。而內閣永無解　國會之機會彼此關係陷於偏頗。假令政府與國會常相堅持。僵局無開展之望。形勢惡化。則政變難免發生。其結果不僅民治成窒寒形態。即共和政體本身之動搖。恐亦在所不　。是則最後之一轉　。使立法與行政兩機關。得盡共「糾正與平衡」之作用。亦可謂為法蘭西民治精神之一種表現　。</p>
<p>去年春杜邁格組閣後以法政府與議會之關係不若英國方面之圓活。擬成所謂憲政改革妥協案即（一）總選舉一年之內。總統得參院之同意。得解散國會。（二）總選舉一年之後。總統不得參院之同意。亦得解散國會。此案卒因眾院急進社會黨之反對而失敗。蓋法國議會自認係一國主權之代表。如以有獨裁傾向之大權。永久賦予行政機關。對於法國民族性。殊不相容。今茲之財政全權案。規定政府所頒行之法令。須於明年六月一日前提交國會追認。則與前案有永久性與暫時性之不同矣。</p>
<h3>英派經濟顧問來華　倫敦各界欣悅　表示切實扶助我國決心　美法允派專家同時前來</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）今日此間得悉、美國現正考慮簡派專家一人赴華考察財政狀況、此說因英國近曾提議國際對華援助而更為有力、如能實現、則將與英國羅斯爵士訪華之舉同時進行、蓋羅氏赴華目的雖為討論國際債欵、惟據悉亦將詳細研究美國白銀政策對於中國財政及商務之影響云、此間一般人咸以為英美兩國之外、他國亦頗感興趣、且亦皆準備派員赴華、調查研究、按參院於辯論國際對華貸欵之時、民主黨參議員路易斯曾竭力反對美國參加、而以美國對外貸欵向來未有良　、結果為理由云、（十日國民社電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄邊防軍　被日軍擊斃案　俄提抗議但日認在滿境</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯駐日大全館參事拉衣維特、為六月三日日滿軍隊侵犯蘇聯邊境事件、向日外務省提出抗議、謂日滿軍隊潛伏於蘇聯邊境、襲擊守衛邊境之紅軍　兵二名、當彼二人遠離邊界　千七百公尺之際、其中一名在　槍掃射之下、衝至前哨求助、當蘇聯救護隊趕至襲擊之處、僅發見若干砲彈箱、少數砲彈及血跡、另一紅軍顯係被殺或被傷、並被彼等攜入滿境、蓋尚有馬蹄足跡可見也、拉衣維特要求追查並處罰罪犯、並要求禁止以後發生同樣之侵犯行為、（十一日塔斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）今夜、報載稱、最近日滿軍侵犯蘇俄邊疆及擊斃蘇俄邊防兵案、駐東京之蘇俄大使已向日本外務省提出嚴重抗議、抗議書略謂、本月三日上午九時、日滿軍侵入蘇俄邊疆達一英哩之遠、然後向蘇俄邊防二守衛開火、當時蘇俄邊防守衛並未還擊、僅派一人奔赴後方報告、待後方增援隊伍趕到、則僅見地上血跡殷然、而該守衛已不在該處、可見該守衛已為日滿軍擊斃、然後拖入「滿洲國」境云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）六月三日俄滿東部國　密山附近發生日俄軍隊衝突事件、　日俄使館萊希參事十日訪問外務省東鄉歐亞局長、提出抗議、並要求引渡被日軍捕去之俄兵數人、外務省於十一日正午發表談話如次、據駐滿南大使公報、日軍守備隊六月三日警備滿境內、突被侵入滿境之蘇俄紅軍射擊、日軍不得已還擊、驅逐俄兵至國境外、當時遺棄　傷兵一人、（至後死亡）與軍馬兩匹於國境線以內二百米地點、此事件在滿國境內以生係明白之事、且日軍應戰係正當防禦、日軍當局五日命駐哈爾濱特　機關長對俄駐軍哈總領　提出抗議、然俄總領以未接報告為理由、迄今保留答覆、外線省現已訓電南大使、現地進行交涉、以謀解決、（十一日聯社電）</p>

<p>吉士德　美國　總理赫爾今日對本雪　凡尼亞陸軍大學畢業禮演說、謂軍備擴大不已、為世界和平經濟安定與國際健全之危害、美國以扶助他人阻止戰爭保持和平而不放棄美國固有主義為政策、若乾國內備戰工作、現幾已達於摧毀其國內生產力之程度、凡了解此種危險之國家、必須對於備戰者大聲疾呼、使之覺悟佳兵不詳云、（十日路透電）</p>

<h3>顧馨一談　逐年減購洋米</h3>
<p>商人决無願購洋米之理　應使國內產量逐年增加</p>
<p>我國雖稱以農立國、但年來洋米進口、其數實屬驚人、不論朝野、均思挽救之法、實業部部長陳公博氏、擬使米商進購洋米、逐年遞減、第年以十分之一為限、中央社記者持以此事詢諸糧食界鉅子顧馨一氏、據談如次、</p>
<p>應增國內生產</p>
<p>據顧氏談、年來洋米進口之激增、因國內受天災之區擴大、使收成大减、不得不購取洋米以求挹注、此當非我國人之所樂意者、今奢當局在消極方面增加洋米稅、在積極方面使農民生活趨於安定、生產技術日趨改善、則國內糧食產量見增、洋米自可杜絕、故商人方面祇須國內所產米糧、足以維持民食、决無再行進購洋米之理、如以逐年遞减、亦應由逐年在國內生產量上逐年遞加云、</p>
<p>確無暹米入口</p>

<h3>胡蝶載譽將歸　林雪懷昨逝世　失戀以後意志蕭索復被病緾　遺容瘦黑不復當年潘郎丰度</h3>
<p>中央社云、我國電影女演員胡蝶、參加蘇聯國際影展、遨遊歐陸各國、行將歸來、不料當年為彼介紹踏入電影圈、一度訂白首之盟而復以雪蝶婚變之林雪環、竟以去世聞、是亦足　注意雪蝶者所慨嘆者、胡蝶　於海外得此噩耗、諒亦有所戚喟、</p>
<p>雪蝶初緣　林雪懷現年三十四歲、廣東中山人、美豐姿、擅攝影、入現在藝華影片公司、充任導演之陳鏗然所創辦之友聯影片公司為專業員、旋識胡蝶、因彼綽約多姿、嫵媚天成、乃竭力設法介紹入友聯任演員、此即今日踏入電影圈之時、林最初在百合公司主演「採茶女」影片、第一片則在明星公司所演者、為「最後之良心」、至是乃與胡蝶合演「秋扇怨」片成、胡蝶聲譽漸起、乃轉入天　公司、旋又成明星、以於今、據林雪懷之姊夫鄭靜安語中央社記者謂、當時胡之父母、戚林之誘掖、乃以女妻之、</p>

<p>明，代名人楊椒山（繼盛）先生，讀史者均知其因諫開馬市而誦官，其後陞遷兵部武選司員外郎，因奏參嚴嵩而遇難，先生一生學問，論者均謂其專力於經濟，而不知先生亦復爲一音樂家。日前余於友人處得見李卓吾先生所定楊椒山年譜，略云：公三十四歲官南京吏部主事時，嘗從兵部尙書韓公邦奇習律呂之學，三月而得其數。椒山自以樂非他學可比。不能徒事口說，必須自己能製器，能作樂，播之聲音。各相和諧，而後始能謂爲音樂家。於是自置刀鑽斧鋸，購桐竹絲漆，先試製管，再製琴瑟笙簫塤箎之類，試之，聲無不諧，更合諸樂總奏之，如出一律，無不和諧。其後韓公更命椒山試製十二律之管，每管各備五音，七聲各成一調，椒山殫思竭慮，廢寢忘餐者三日，忽有所悟，卒製成十二管而獻於韓公。由是知樂之名，傳遍南都云云，余按椒山擅長音樂之名，爲節烈氣節所掩，遂致不傳，良用慨然，年來國人競尙研究西樂，原有之國樂，未聞有能加改善者，苟椒山所製十二管樂器之方法得傳，則於國樂方面，亦　　異彩矣。</p>
<h3>車上推銷員</h3>
<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>近　各路電車上，時常　了一個手提小皮篋的人、他並不佔用座位，只站在當中，尊一聲「各位諸君」之後，他便開始背誦起來了。他設的話非常迅速，有如在唱流水板的戲文無論他賣的是葡萄乾，菓子糖，牙刷，簿荷錠，民丹，各種物品，他們演說的體裁多是一個式樣的。他說他在車上做做廣吿，買價特別低廉；各大公司老大房天祿藥房均有出售，只是價錢不及他便宜。後來他便從皮篋裏拿出些貨樣來，給大家試試有時是兩粒葡萄乾，捲在一張薄紙裏，每人派着一份：有些人接了過來，不客氣地生夢了；有些人不好意思地拿在手裏。却沒有人肯出兩毛錢買他五包的。於是那個推鎖員便失望地下車去了。</p>
<p>昨天我要去卡德路，在長長的電車途程中，接連來了幾個推銷員，一個是賣民丹的，在他的演說之後，每一個搭客的口裏多了一粒民丹。大槪是天熱而嘴乾的綠故吧，大家對於那粒民丹表示歡迎，倒做了幾毛錢的交易。少頃，、又來了一個賣薄荷錠的。照例演說完畢，他拿起那粒薄荷在每個客人的太陽穴上和鼻孔下輕擦兩下，藉以試騐功效，他是很公平的，就連坐在我斜對面的那個麼登小姐也給他擦上兩擦，當全車坐客的眼睛集中在伊點臉上時，伊便滿臉飛紅起來。為要遮掩羞慚起見，伊索性從銀夾裏挖出兩毛錢來買了一錠。果然空氣因此緩和下來了。</p>
<p>車上推銷員雖是巧妙的營業之一種，但我總以爲有點妨碍車上的秩序吧。</p>
<h3>郭小姐</h3>
<p>— 小冬</p>
<p>郭小姐十七歲時在S鎭上還是一個黃毛丫頭，自從隨伊母親到S埠住了五年，居然變成了一個都市小姐，蓬鬆的秀髮，套着一個黑色軟緞製成的箍花；纖細的畫眉下有長長的睫毛，櫻唇上略施口紅，臉龐上雖然未敷脂粉，已覺得十分嫵媚動人！時代的新裝，一天更換數襲，直把S鎭上的靑年風魔了一般！</p>
<p>據春先生的品評，郭小姐的臉蛋兒並不長得十分佳妙，不過伊的服裝確是很妖冶的，身段有幾分像影星葛來泰嘉寶，更操着流利的滬白，像這種女子S鎭上是破天荒第一次見到。春先生不時對朋友說；「顚不刺的見了萬千，這般可喜娘罕曾見，眼花撩亂口難言，魂靈兒飛去了半天。」伊有這樣醉人的魔力，難怪把整個S鎭都轟動了。</p>
<p>郭小姐在S埠做什麼勾當，却很費閒人猜疑多數人的猜測和探討，肯定伊是充當舞女，因爲伊講起舞經很熟。可是郭小姐有點怪脾氣，見了人不肯招待，這就是伊招禍的因子，所以不能容留在S　鎭了。但是伊不是生意上的人，又何必來招待這斑狂蜂浪蝶呢？伊雖然離開了S鎭，伊的名譽是保住淸白的，不過伊走了以後有很多的人在懷想呢。</p>
<p>誌謝　京滬滬杭甬鐵路局輯印之東南塔影　書，現已出版。包括該路沿綫各地著名巨塔三十四處，每塔除精印照像外，並將其來歷與風景扼要叙述。每册實價銀兩角，該路各大站，各營業所及各鐵路旅館均有發售。承贈兩册，特爲誌謝。</p>
<p>社會寫真</p>
<h3>時疫院中一怪人</h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>初夏裏有今年最熱的第一天來臨，狄感到大伏天的威脅便迅運觸想着去夏我親歷的一個境遇，値得一執。在天明前三點纔過，一陣陣的肚痛醒來，痛接着瀉，愈鬧愈兇，我乃决計投時疫醫院。問過最近的一家，那可驚的診費限我忍到七點後前往。經過診視，說須住院的，我由家人扶上樓，一個樓面攔分兩排病房，中留甬道，我進了北首一排二等病房的一間，乏極倒身便睡。</p>
<p>「……高媽呀……替他買冰忌淋呀……給他吃呀，熱煞了呀……高媽呀，修脩好罷……」</p>
<p>這意外的，逐句尾音拖長的，顚宋倒去是這一套的吵嚷聲驚醒了疲乏的我，入耳不絕。鬧了半天，揚州口音證明那唯一的女僕在遠遠裏吆喝着，應承着，制止他別鬧。果然安靜了一時，但不久又鬧新花樣：</p>
<p>「賣豆腐漿呀……給他吃呀……去買來呀，高媽呀……」</p>
<p>不耐煩的叱駡聲還是揚州白，也可叱得那吵聲休息五分鐘。過後「舊吵重溫」，却把呼喚的對象高媽改了王小姐；乞憐的聲持久不休，似有不達目的不止之概。應酬的硬嚇軟騙的語者昭示大家，所謂王小姐就是那位女看護，原來伊兼負着看護此公的責任的。</p>
<p>經找作伴的家人調查所得，講故事一般的報吿我，打破了這一時期的疑團，雖是依然無法解除　繼續聽到那怪嚷聲的煩惱。</p>
<p>在南首一排頭等房的末底一間中住着一個中年人，這人髭長髮亂，臉瘦而白，赤脚拖鞋皮，尙穿棉襖褲，儘在房中蹀　來往，若見有人窺看他也知暫停叫喚，人家看得久了也不願迴避了。</p>
<p>據院役高媽說：「這人家道原很不錯，本領也有，他住在這裏除了吃食無壓之餘，不時的隨口念念書句，或者獨自說幾句外國話咧。只因他做着交易所生意，進出很大。去年有一晚上，他的一個高徒年輕好頑，竟逗師傳取樂起來，裝作正經的嚇着他說：「今天市面大有變動，你的買賣算來竟要虧負到某種程度了！」他頓時受驚便發了瘋，雖經百般解釋，眞相證明，一切都不中用了！本院的主持人和他有親誼，留他在院療養，從去年辦理時疫過後進　直到如今，我們也受他的累够咧！他家裏的人，甚至他的妻，惱他不禁大嚇，無理取鬧，也灰了心不大高興來探望他了，但留一點供給他使用的錢，養老罷咧！</p>
<p>雖然我沒有瞧這趣劇繼續演出的能耐，並也受不住北窗午後的，說不定或足釀成時疫的日曬，當天請求出了院，我不反對這位半痴半醒的怪人照常住下去，吃一些應時的，或是他想得出冷門的食品，祇須這全樓面上的共他時疫病人礙於院主的顏面，或因於各個人的同情的憐憫，沒有誰肯首倡發難。</p>
<p>况且，這人是中了交易所的高熱度纔變常態的，不敎他住時疫醫院却住在那裏呢？他的那位令親，留他住爲所在確再合適沒有了，眞是一個妙人兒呵！</p>
<p>不知今年這家時疫醫院裏尙有留着這人沒有。我很紀念這個可憐的怪人呢！</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>它的頂上還用最上等的木料很精巧地彫漆成一行琉璃，亙的式樣，遠遠地望去，和眞的毫沒差別，也可見其築造的精緻了！太后自已就坐在這一艘御舟上，另外又從我們八位女官中挑出四人來，—我也是其中的一人—同上舟去，結伊做伴。這也可算是一種充分貴族化的郊外遊宴。</p>
<p>太后的主意一定，合宮的人便立卽忙着準備起來：最先大家就簇擁着伊上那停舶御舟的船塢中去，瞧着那些專司行舟的小太監們整理好了櫓篙，站到了它們應站的位置上去，然後由我們四個女官，小心扶掖太后上船，讓伊老人家很舒服地在那特備的御座上坐定了；接着就有人去打開了那兩扇又高又大的塢門，放這御舟慢慢地，穩穩地浮將出去。那些行舟的太監都是訓練得很好的，他們能够盡量的减少尋常行舟時所有的搖蕩。</p>
<p>出了船塢，先是一段短短的支流，約莫行了四五分鐘，這御舟才出現在波平如鏡的昆明湖上了。太后嘴角上的笑容，雖然依舊是微笑，却始終不曾消滅。伊見了眼前所擺着的這一幅鮮明的湖景便越發高興了，兩顆眸子裏充滿着富於生氣的光芒。天上的紅日，把湖水照成了一泓金漿一樣，在在使伊感到歡暢；而我們也因伊一人的歡暢而同感歡暢了。（三三七）</p>
<h3>哭謝大覲虞</h3>
<p>— 鄭曼靑</p>
<p>悲吟哭謝大：濡　雙淚零，苦憶垂死日，握手已無聲，未忍坐相視，出戶不能行，欲語復嗚咽，令弟正相迎，謂稚柳）稚子滿階立，安知痛所生，生別兼死別，凄其隔世情，歸來不成寐，未曉鴉已鳴，果然耗音至，舊友皆相驚，此事吾轉疑，君去能復生，招魂託雙鯉，傳語到九冥，惟君不可死，爲山未乃成，堂上悲白髮，海內哭親朋，魂兮胡不歸，魂兮胡靈，坐懷長逝者，犬地愁城，生日君善病，詞翰凌長卿，君今了不知，人嗟樑楝傾，與吾交—載，相愛若弟兄，陽斷三春鳥，嚶鳴誰復聽。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十四回　別有悟心西人該建設不無遺憾寒十種相思</p>
<p>志前笑道　還不僅是如此呢，我覺得北海眞愛上了這姑娘，他可不了。現在這姑娘就爲了一家三口，每天的飯不能解决，急於要找個糧行。北海要想相他談戀愛，首先就得擔任這三個人的伙食，他自己還愁着肚子不容易飽呢，能替人家養活兩代人嗎，所能我秉了這至大至公的心，在那姑娘面前加以歡解，希望他們不要接近。有容唉了一聲，笑道：這是你錯了。該戀愛的人，講的是赴湯蹈火，在所不辭，沒有飯吃，何足加以阻礙，假使這位姑娘，願意嫁王君，他們倒可以做一對貧賤夫妻。論到王君，遲早總是要娶親的，添個女人，不應談到負擔上去。現在就是姑娘的祖母和母親，算是額外之人。可是王君家裏是農人，旣可以送兒子出來進學校，大概糧食總還够吃。添兩個人吃飯，也許沒有多大問題，你何不等王君來了，仔細問他一問。他眞是能力不够，你再勸止他，也不算晚要不然，促成人家的婚姻，這比救人一命的功德，要大過十倍去。若是他們爲了結婚費無着，老實說，我就可以帮助個二五塊錢。說着，滿臉帶了笑容，現用那高興的樣子來。志前躊躇着站了起來，向他望着。（二三七）</p>

<h3>證券　公債漲後又跌</h3>
<p>九六波濤尤巨　起伏達二元半</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、債市起伏而且驟、按大漲大跌連續已有多日而波動力迄今未見減縮、誠爲今年來公債市多事之秋也、九六公債免起　落、波濤尤巨、最初經散戶之吸收、高峯曾到十元半、後以四號及北幫之拋賣、市價復跌至八元餘、計先漲一元、結果反路落元半至七角、投機之熱、歎觀止矣、趨勢前途、因多空雙方尚在猛烈爭逐、波濤一時尚難驟平也、昨因交易繁忙、全日仍做三盤、市價結果、一致仍漲三五角至七八角不等、成交總額共約四千尤元左右、茲將其高低結果、列比較如左、（單位元）</p>

<h3>紗花　川幫旺辦中之棉紗</h3>
<p>紗市續漲、且局漢常堅挺、蓋因連朝下降、反動愈烈、兼之久經停頓之川幫、忽然活動、購買頗暢有二千包、全日客幫成交三千包以外、因此人心大爲震盪、且有部分由空翻多、市盤漲力較強、</p>
<p>標紗步步上升</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、近有尚平疲、拍至遠月　昂、二·二盤漲風激烈、空頭大量扒補、長豐·潤康買進爲多、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲八角至一元·三·四角、午後開盤風勢較緊、聞川採辦更暢、有二千包、其他幫亦有一千包之譜、同時傳說金融可望鬆動、於是買氣特盛、二·三盤外商又來拋出、行市稍回、結果各月比上午收盤價漲三·四·六·八角、查賣出大孚一千包、源大一千八百包、合興八百包、泰興七百包、益昶一千六百包、信誠一千九百包、愼昌一千五百包、長豐二千五百包、買進通記一千一百五十包、達記三千一百五十包、長豐二千零五十包、潤康三千八百包、明德一千四百包、大昌成四千六百五十包、泰昌一千一百五十包、日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>棉花跟紗市上進</h3>
<p>棉市仍挺、因紗市上升、多頭活動、而散空太多、視環境稍好、扒補者愈衆、故市盤向騰、但有部份因紗廠停工者甚多、一時無開工希望、逢漲時拋賣、尚不乏人、</p>
<p>紗花逢漲有拋出</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、塲中市氣尚平、因外棉轉落十餘磅音、拍至三盤。紗市上升、塲中實風亦起、但多數心理、紗廠停工、原料需用減少、逢漲拋賣者尚不乏人、市氣稍軟、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一角、二角、三角、午後開盤、隨紗市而狂漲、後有一部份拋出、稍回、結果、各月比上午收盤價漲五分至一·二角、查賣出通記五千一百擔、大孚七千六百擔、源大四千三百擔、穗隆一千四百擔、振大二千擔、益昶一千八百擔、源興昌二千一百擔、買進潤康三千七百擔、穗隆一千六百擔、昶記二千二百擔、森康三吉一百擔、長豐三千二百擔、生源二千三百擔、元一六千三百擔、泰昌三千二百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食　各地新麥俱已開盤　加拿大擬取銷雜糧交易所</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、各月份市面、平靜穩固、當開價時、以洋麥微好、各方面多趨觀望、交易不暢、市則見穩、較之前日收價、計好二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、七月份交易不多、八九月份則交易甚暢、初以紛市高昂、人心穩固、後則多頭回出、及客戶套售、又稍回落、照目下到貨漸湧、或者七月份市面、當須帶落一點也、結果七月份仍好二分、八月份不動、九月份小一分、十月份不動現麥市面、仍見定勢、因到貨接續、船車麥日到五六千包、廠方有意觀望、故難升提、開管店滁州沙河集麥三元四角二分、揚州太平和州浦鎭麥三元二角半、安定吳淞麥三元　角八分、崑山麥三元二角六分、蓬萊麥三元　角、塘市麥三元　三四分、陸家浜麥三元二角、信大去一千包、阜豐去一千五百包、福新去二千包云、</p>

<h3>期粉買進始終不衰</h3>
<p>粉市昨日續漲、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好四分至一二角左右、坎拿大小四分零、當開價時、以洋麥祗見微好、人心本應平淡、旋因業外人心良好、近期以客幫活動、紛起抵補、　期則外行大批買進、咕價即俏、較之前日收價、計好二三分不等、後則買進稍平、廠方略出微見軟弱、惟各盤變方爭競甚烈、交易曾做五十餘萬包、迨至下午開盤、因麥市平和、人心平疲、旋回多頭又進、又見回振、但交易已清、祗做二十餘萬、後叔局面、如實銷良好、此種市面、或能站定也、結果本月份續好二分二厘半、七月份漲二分、八月份漲一分七厘半、九月份漲一分二釐半、十月份漲一分二厘半、十一月份漲一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>到米更稀行市則漲</h3>
<p>本米滬南昨日各邦來源尤稀、祗到七八號（貨共千七八百石、）銷塲亦呆、包胃僅青島幫辦三百來包、行情增高、惟市氣似乎欠固、各厚粳及中市晚稻等價悉見升數分、角砠不等、等高薄稻以貨優價貴、銷化較淡、無甚榮辱、陰變元及杜尖等各花色、供求相仿亦無上落、滬北昨日河下各路來源十六七號、市上各貨去胃、白粳轉呆、薄稻平常、其餘各貨續化、市價白粳略轉軟勢、薄稻定局、白元挺立、其他花色無甚上落、</p>
<p>洋米客化仍活、浙省內地各幫繼續辦裝外、南京幫去胃突旺、長江方面有巡慶鎭江各幫問津、市面隨見繼續上展、如今明去化再旺、行情尚有步砌之必要、昨日西貢一號及小絞米已漲起一角、三號米及碎米等略爲帶定、全日開出西貢各米一萬五千包、小絞七千包、暹邏高貢各米二千多包、客秈五百包、由江浙皖及本街分去、</p>
<h3>四鄉得雨豆餅動銷</h3>
<p>昨日豆餅現貨銷塲轉見活動、原因爲天氣陰霾、四鄉或許得雨、插秧種田、或有希望、故上下午行情、須漲起二三分、共計交易各餅萬六七千片、（行情請看市價欄）黃豆去路尚不弱、統市成交車輪各荳十八九車、但市況依然平疲、主因受東省人荳壓迫、（昨聞有路貨四平街荳五十車成交價祗三元五角）所以市況欲振無力也、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新繭竹枝亟宜改良</h3>
<p>漳州所產繭竹枝、本屆花苗尚佳、預計收成當在六七分之譜、昨據函息、本月杪可以見新、該處貨客、因聞粵產金山枝歉收、辦價遂致抬高、惟照現在銀根局勢而論、恐屆時銷路難暢、況貨品遜於粵產、亦非改良不可、如尖粒無肉之荔枝、既不能食、亦無實用、亟宜剔出、方能引動銷胃、今年既值金山枝歉收、亟宜乘機改良、以期推廣銷路、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲價計較祗差念元左右</h3>
<p>前日復活節、國內外西商例得休業、絲市因之更寂、日來滬埠對外絲電發出甚夥、然鮮有來賑、據云刻雙方價格相距僅二十元左右、祗因匯票飄忽異常、致難成交、若金價能稍安定、諒不難打開保護性互相觀望之僵局也、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶續跌</h3>
<p>路莊珍眉綠茶、昨市略形呆淡、遂安屯溪溫州等路貨、市盤復趨下跌、抽芯普通珍眉、平均較前見跌三四元、平水土莊兩路綠茶、去路尤爲疲鬆、浙省各縣毛茶、現下尚有十份之六七、囤滯茶戶手中、完全無人銷受、</p>

<h3>「腐」乎「濫」乎？</h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>四月號「文學」里的一篇短文，引起了無礙先生之對於歐化文體及字彙的「腐與濫」的感慨，藉題發揮，竟連「機構」「矛盾」「動向」也遭了白眼。無礙先生接者還引了英人洛克的一段話，來證明用這類字眼的人們可笑，其實洛克也並不會說這些字眼絕不可用，而祇說應用得恰當適切而已。「機構」「矛盾」「動向」各具有其特殊的用義，用之固毫無可笑之點；而「順動的心弦」「悲哀的網」，祇要表現着適切，不至於開口便「愛呵，我的心弦顫動着呢！」也就是不足爲病的。天冀的頑笑：「女人如贅瘤似的拖累着我，小孩子是雨似他被誕生出來，一切小布爾喬亞的悲劇在漸漸地觸到我們了，……」這一段話的毛病，並不在於「太做作」「受了刻意爲文之害」，而在於一譬喻不切，立意不顯」，和歐化文體並無關係。小孩子的「被誕生」固然不會「雨似地」，但「小布爾喬亞的悲劇在漸漸地觸到我們了」一語，在文法上却並無可非議之點。</p>
<p>我相信「許多人的作品，字里行間充滿了「機構」「矛盾」『　向』」這類字眼的原因，决不在於「競炫新奇」「搔首弄姿」，更不在於爲了自己「思想簡單」「恐怕寫出文章來別人要嫌淺薄，所以硬綁綁從字句上去用工夫，想要別人看起來難懂」，也不在於「因爲沒有話說而偏要說，於是揑嗓子，裝腔做勢」，而在於作者缺少一種更適切更平的表現方法，方不得不拾用這此字眼，呌閱慣了綫　書的中年朋女們頭痛。</p>
<p>寫得好懂些；是應該的。但假如得不到更平易這切的字眼，那麼還是來個把「機構」「矛盾」「動向」「上層建築」「下層基礎」吧，雖然「費解」，但還並不是「不可解」。「體格健全的女子，荊釵布裙也別具風致」，對極；但假如連「別具風致」的「布裙」都得不到，那就隨便抓點現成的（就是「洋貨」也並無不可）東西穿穿，祇要合身，雖看起來「不大舒適」，或者「愈看愈不舒適」，竟連着的「興味」都失掉，也行，因爲這祇能怪看的太愛「舒適」，太愛「別具風緻」的「荊釵布裙」，養成了習慣，所以一看外國裝飾便覺有些刺眼。</p>
<p>林大師不是因爲白話之「底地」並用而感到它的夾緾以及提倡語錄的必要麼？我看還是「底地」下去的好。在這里，我的見地，是與無礙先生有些不同的。</p>
<h3>看了然畫「橋」記</h3>
<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>去年回到鄕下去過夏，正是鄕下人苦　着臉嚷一天乾地焦、的時候。比較乾凈些的水，人家都用甕　盛起來，像金錢樣寶貴。茶館關門了。飲茶都受了限制。洗臉水用過了，還要派洗菜或是洗衣的用途。河是早就乾了。到湖濱的鄉農跑來說：「隔湖已乾下去五六里路了」的時候，人們臉上祇有失驚的苦笑。</p>
<p>我那時决心想下湖去看看。多少是想搜集些材料，來描寫一下農民的痛苦的。</p>
<p>我約了喜歡書習的朋友顧了然君同去。</p>
<p>可是當我們的計劃剛要實現時，立刻又被打消了。有許多朋友都勸我們不要去。那時的農民已因絕望而變成瘋狂了。我們跑去，是很容易惹他們發怒的。他們忍受不住我們整齊的衣服，潔凈的手對，不流汗不曬焦的臉龐，他們更不能忽受我們這種悠閒的態度　閒散的情緒！「呔！我們在死亡綫上掙扎，而你們却來觀賞！」換了我們，也會那麼想的。</p>
<p>可是像這種大旱災，是地　大湖，而汶港汶紛歧的我的故鄕很難得看見的。我們想把這個慘痛的印象，留下來做個紀念的心很强烈。了然决意要　一　旱年的景象。最後，我們差不多就在說這話的地方，找到了題材了，——是我們小鎭上的橋梁。當時發現到我們脚　就是我們想找了許久的絕妙的題材時，我們都吃驚了，阿！該有多少眼前的好材料，而被寫作的人忽略過去啊！</p>
<p>走到對着橋洞的石河埠上，蹲下來一看。這熟悉的石橋，竟會是變得這樣陌生。牠高到眞有些駭人。因爲平時給水湮沒的下半部，現在是全赤露出來了。黃泥的河底，本來是祇有幾個沒給太陽吮乾的綠色臭水潭的，現在却增多了十多個丈餘深的井似的水塘了。把　蓆將泥土隔開，居然有渾黃的水沁出來。我們都感謝想這個辦法出來的聰明人！有時一些小的聰明，也會救活許多人的。</p>
<p>人們不但在河底裏挑水，有許多人走過對街，也冉不依賴這頂大橋了。有個婦人，偷偷地跑了兩隻鴨，放在水塘裏面等他們鳧水，可是當道兩隻鴨快活得呷呷的呌時，她又立刻像是受驚的老鼠似的，連忙撈起鴨走了。</p>
<p>了然畫那項橋，直畫了四五天功夫。看他用黃顏色，灰顏色，藍顏色。黃的是河底，灰盡是有種沉痛的筆觸和情緒的</p>
<p>當了然盡畫的時候，照例每天都有許多鎭上的人包圍着看的。在他將近畫完這一天，也正是簇擁着他的人最多的一天，有一個鄕下人擠進來了。到他擠了進來，看到是什麼回事時，他又立刻失望的擠了出去，一邊嘴裏還嚷：</p>
<p>「我以爲有西洋景看呢！原來是那麼，套撈什子！難道這梗東西，可以當做飯吃嗎？也値得聚了那麼多的人看！」</p>
<p>他的話當然是莽撞的，可是他是代表了多少鄕農說的話啊！裏面是包括了不少給寫作的人的目標和眞理的。他們現在需要的還是「吃飯」。而不是別的東西。同時我又想到我們寫的東西，不管自己以為是這樣的工農化，實在離開他們的生活和需要，還是很遠很遠的。所以切的人都是一樣，先　裝滿了胃，然後能來裝滿腦子的。</p>

<h3>大學時代（一）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托漠著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>娜麗</p>
<p>我沒有個姊妹，因此沒有人介紹我去同年齡相當的姑娘結交朋友。但我是去　　跳那的。跳舞功課每星期兩次，地點　在本城市政府十　；　市政廳同時又是市　底住宅。市　　兒子是我的　　明　，　他　丙，他們一起有八　，國　跳無，本城市　　　，　級生　滿在汽車了。不過說到五舞伴，起初倒發生了一個　於解决的門題：第八個地位相當的女舞伴無法物色得來。</p>
<p>但市長公子弗里茨　有辦法的。有個女人從前在他家裏當　娘，至今每逢有宴會時候，市長去人還是找她　　忙。。她嫁給個裁製舊衣裳裁　匠，一個法國姓的瘦弱的黃面人，他在酒店裏說大話昨比在裁縫棹旁拿起針綫做工時，還更喜歡些。這一家住在城底盡頭對着宮邸茲園的那些術上。那個小　　　那株十　堤樹是　們所類　的，這樹地門　那個唯一的窗戶幾乎完全　　了。我們當黨在那屋前經海，為的　向那個可愛的小姑娘　瞥一眼：她時常愛坐在幾盆木犀草和確嘴草後而縫着東西，她在我們的幼時幻想裏實佔了個頗爲重要的位置。</p>
<p>她是法國裁縫底唯一孩子，一個十三歲的　　好女，穿的衣裳雖然是平常布料製的，但她的母親替她收拾得非常乾凈。微褐色的皮膚和對暗　的大眼睛，表明她的父親是異國的血統。　還記得，她把妙那　黑梳得很低，一直垂到兩太陽穴旁邊，這使她那本來不大的面孔更顯得嫵媚好看。</p>
<h3>沒有爸爸</h3>
<p>— 陳福熙</p>
<p>秋兒沒有爸爸。</p>
<p>爸爸死啦。但秋兒小知道死是什麼。爸爸死的時候，看見媽哭，姊姊哭，於是他也跟着哭，他不曉得爲什麼要哭，只覺得哭是好玩。平常，醒來的時候不見媽，他便哭；看見想吃的東西而不買，他也哭；或者，鄰家的孩子打他，他也要哭；而日哭起來，眼淚一行行直淌，好像說不出的苦楚。爸爸死，秋兒沒有吊眼淚，只學着媽乾號，乾號幾聲就笑起來了。</p>
<p>「媽，爸爸睏，爸……」</p>
<p>扭住媽的衣角說。媽却不理他，只顧哭。秋兒看得奇怪：爲什麼媽老是對着爸哭呢？他是個五歲的孩子，剛會跑，會說話，什磨都不懂，有人替他穿孝衣，那白的麻衣，白的鞋，白的帽，更使秋兒納罕：他看見媽，姊姊，哥哥，也都穿着白的。小肚子裏想：穿了白的衣，大槪要到街街去玩；因爲過去，媽和爸同他去看戲時，每次都換了新衣去的，因之他穿好了孝衣，脚跟有點站不穩了，生怕媽和姊姊不和他同去，嘴裏呶呶的說：</p>
<p>「去看呀，街街去……　他這麼亂噪沒有人睬他。秋兒眞是可憐呀，什麼都不懂得。當他慢慢地大起來，就沒有看見過親生的爸。在他腦子裏，永遠不知道自己是有爸爸的。一個晴和的下午，秋兒跑到鄰家去玩，看見阿毛有花白的橡皮狗，巧克力糖，和一輛嶄新的，好玩的小汽車，只要把發條一絞，那汽車就在平滑的地面上開動。秋兒看見這小汽車，歡喜極了，恨不得馬上從阿　那兒拿回去。他平日所看見的，是龐大的汽車，但像這樣玲瓏。這樣新奇的小汽車，秋兒倒一向不曾見過。現五被他突然看見。因爲愛慕它而不能獲得，使他低回了。他很想自己也有這麼一把，要想向阿毛討，又開不得口，曉得阿毛一定不肯送人的。心想能够借來玩玩也好，於是喃喃地向阿毛要求：</p>
<p>「讓我玩玩這小汽車好嗎？」</p>
<p>「好的。」</p>
<p>得到了阿毛的允許，秋兒就拿在手裏絞發條，不一會，汽車果在光滑的水門汀上走了。秋兒看得眼紅，玩了再玩，最後問：</p>
<p>「阿毛，這是誰買給你的？」</p>
<p>「是我爸爸。」</p>
<p>「爸爸？」</p>
<p>聽到爸爸」兩個字，秋兒發呆了。心裏想：我怎麼沒有爸爸昵？我的爸爸</p>
<p>那兒？他怎麼不給我買小汽車呢？阿毛的爸，秋兒是認得的，是個戴眼鏡，穿洋服的，是時常抱了阿毛吻的，但不明白自己爲什麼沒有爸爸。</p>
<p>他帶着悒鬱的情緒走回家來了。</p>
<p>「媽，我有爸爸嗎？」秋兒問。</p>
<p>「怎麼沒有呢！」</p>
<p>「那麼我的爸爸正那裏」</p>
<p>「等你大了會曉得的。」</p>
<p>秋兒惘然了。寒食節時候，家裏人統到鄕下去掃墓，媽指着一個像饅頭樣的靑塚說：</p>
<p>「你的爸爸就在這裏面……」</p>
<p>他似乎有點曉得，却曉得不淸楚，仍舊不領略死是什麼，以爲爸總有一天會回家的，所以第二天，碰見阿毛的時候，他朝阿毛說：</p>
<p>「我也有爸爸的。」</p>
<p>說着，秋兒快樂得笑起來了。彷彿他的爸也快要替他買把嶄新的，玲瓏的小汽車。</p>
<h3>白靈廟（下）</h3>
<p>— 袁塵影</p>
<p>蒙古包後面立着「鄂博」的山頭，有幾個人在那裏眺望，我慢慢兒走上無能為力，山並不高，在立著鄂博的地方向前望去：是一片平垠的大草原，冷風從北面吹來，藍的天上浮散着大塊的白雲，望着前面茫茫的大地，這時候我突然想到假如有騎着蒙古馬的大隊蒙古兵在這上面馳騁，那景象一定是雄武的。</p>
<p>下了山坡，我們的男孩子在孩子們都去逛廟去了，剩下我一個人却孤零零地在包中呆　着，一股凄潰孤寂的感情突然佔有了我，從包內走出去，穿過了蒙古包，向河東走去。</p>
<p>走出了那旁邊堆滿了牛糞（註）的蒙古包，空氣是寂靜的，只有幾個行人從獨木橋上走過來，我走過去的時候，也只抬起限　看看我，便又說着我聽不慌的蒙古話向着蒙古包走去了。</p>
<p>過了河，是一些在山脚下的土房，大槪有二十多處，從一個堆滿了垃圾物的巷口走迆去，一條狗靜悄悄的躺在那裏，轉灣處是一個新開張的飯館，炒菜的聲音從裏面傳出來，窗前貼着本店槪不賒帳的紅紙條子，爲了想吹點東西，走了進去，意外的却聽到了一個熟識的聲音：</p>
<p>「喂！什麼時候來的？」</p>
<p>我抬起頭用驚奇的眼光向坑上（註三）看去，却看見在歸化城熟職的H君在招呼我。</p>
<p>「昨天來的！眞凑巧，竟在這裏遇”你。」我邊說着邊坐上坑去，像是他鄉遇親人的樣子。</p>
<p>Ｈ君爲我倒了一杯茶。我問他什麼時候　的？來做什麼？他悄悄的低下頭吿訴我：他來這裏已經有四五天了，是來謀一碗飯吃的，想不到這裏也是人浮於事，人來得太多！無法安挿，他大槪還得回去的……接着他又嘆息的說：「人浮於事」，到處都是如此！連這蒙古地方也有失業了，這裏的土房子住滿了蒙政會的職員和來這裏想在蒙政會謀一碗飯吃的人！……</p>
<p>吃了幾個句子，和Ｈ君走出飯館，他指着我到這裏郵局的地方，便和他吿別了獨自走進了郵局。</p>
<p>郵局是在一個沒有院牆的土房子裏，火爐還生着熊熊的火，一個差人正預備做飯，同郵局的局長談了談，知道這裏發信是用馬驊送，三日發一次信，他是北平人，說這裏生活狠苦，不論春夏秋冬，都沒得靑菜吃，只有郵差還不時從城中帶來些靑菜吃……直到我向他吿辭的時候，他才止住了話頭。</p>
<p>從郵局走出來，想到了Ｈ君的話和這位郵局局長的訴苦，我不禁在這蒙古大地中感覺着彷徨了。</p>
<p>註一，「駝毛被人」係用駝毛做成，中問裝以駝毛，極煖，綏人皆用此被物禦寒。</p>
<p>註二，蒙古包前所堆之牛糞係蒙人在包中生火時所用。</p>
<p>註三·「坑上」北方皆用土坑代床，「坑上」意即為南人稱床上之意。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>防止自殺之商榷</h3>
<p>— 痕</p>
<p>年來自殺之風，日益增加，據本市過去一年之統計，每四小時，卽有一人自殺，其數字之驚人，已足爲民族前途之障碍，近日變本加厲，聚全家同時自殉，其爲禍之慘，直有毀滅民族之虞，討論防止方法，實爲目今刻不容緩之要政，讀吳局長防止自殺意見，立論扼要，仁言利溥，堪稱救時良藥，爰再就吳局長三點中，略加補充，聊當貢獻。</p>
<p>改造心理方面除吳局長對報紙與電影，應竭力避免對自殺者之渲染及不予同情外，更應着重敎育的啟示，樹一公共之目標，國民爲國家組織之要素，毀滅自身，卽爲毀滅國家，鼓舞其努力向上之意志，及人生之眞正價値，際此推行識字敎育之時，正可利用時機，攻擊自殺之罪惡，爲一般無智識人民痛下鍼砭，再一面對各級補習學校，及婦女學校，提示學生以奮鬥精神，至普通中小學校，則應注重生產敎育，職業技能，打破一味埋頭讀書之謬見，爲應付目前經濟之難關。</p>
<p>實力援助方面本市爲平民設法者，僅一市立貧民貸本所，殊嫌過少，實有擴大組織分區設立之必要，並一面改良銀行界小借欵辦法，蓋現在平民，如有急用，至銀行貸欵，頗多困難，卽幸而借欵成立，已不知嘗盡幾許甘苦，竊意銀行借欵，在保障其產權計，只須調查借欵人是否有一藝之畏，及有無保證，卽可成交，正不應有意遷延，使人難堪，故實力援助一層，應令銀行改良辦法，及擴大貧民貸本，所以資周轉也。</p>
<p>改良救濟事業方面照本市情形，大抵注重死者而忽於生者，甚至因辦理慈善雖未必說率用情面，而眞正貧民反不能獲其利益者，確爲事實，爲今之計，應由當局注意各慈善機關，切實監督，並使分利之慈善機關，一變而爲生利機關，其辦法先從調查入手，將所有公私慈善機關，一律由當局指派，分區改善內容，爲工業化之團體，凡申請救濟奢，一律使入所選習工藝，以其所得工資，爲其生活，如有盈餘，半歸公家，半歸私有，殊失業者有業，游惰者動奮，爲大規模之改革，以一驅除向日之專爲分利依賴之機關也。（却酬）</p>
<h3>燈</h3>
<p>— 譚曇</p>
<p>天氣漸漸的熱了，晚上，雖則有些風，但是屋裏的一切，都被整天的太陽烤得火熱。因此，我晚上入睡的時間，不得不一天天改遲，最近甚至電燈都不大敢開，因爲牠的熱度，雖則不很高，但是白熱的光，給我感官上煩熱，是頗爲可觀的。</p>
<p>關於燈，其實我是頗爲歡喜的。假使有人問我，人世間的東西，你最歡喜什磨？那我一定毫不躊躇的回答，——最歡喜燈。</p>
<p>我不曉得自己從母親身中生出來第一次看見燈的時候的戚覺如何？大槪當時對於一切東西都戚到驚奇，所以，决不會特別注意起燈來。而當我有了記憶以後，燈就給我好印象，是淸淸楚楚的。</p>
<p>不知六歲還是七歲，我不和母親睡在一床了。冬天，夜很長，我睡得又早，一覺醒來，常常在一二點鐘的時候。那是母親她們睡下已久，正在濃睡的時候，我雖則着嫩着聲音呌，但她們不大聽得到。這時候，我感到恐怖了。好像家裏人，都跑光了。共留下我一個，正想哭出來的時候，一眼從印光夏布的蚊帳中，看到我床前一張小桌子的一盞媒油燈。那時燈芯已經旋得很小，卽使逼視，也幷不觸目。我立刻像發現一個親人一樣的感到溫煖和安心，就此又呼呼入睡。到現在，這時候的景象，還鮮明的留在我腦海中，特別是那透明的燈罩上，因爲媒氣關係而暈着的一層！</p>
<p>當我十五六歲的時候，已經有了很自然的讀夜書習慣。爲了一本較好的書，讀到晨前三四時，是常有的事。父親因爲我夜讀，特地賣一隻帶有白冗罩的煤油燈給我，牠是比普通煤油燈高幷且大。普通煤油燈的燈芯，是舌形的一條，而牠是一個圈形的；所以牠的光較之普通燈油燈，强有兩三倍之多。當時我沒有在電燈下讀書的經騐，所以點上了牠，就覺得滿屋通明，眼明心暢。尤其有趣的，那種燈，更附有一個粗鉛絲之類做成的架子，架子上更有一個小小的紫銅吊子，晚上一點火，就可以在燈上曉水冲茶，或則煖煖那些已經煮熟的運子百合之類。我晚上不不很要吃東西，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>但很要喝好茶，所以，紫銅吊子，常常在燈架上，發出愉快的呼聲：特別使我高興的，就是幾次大雪的晚上，我讀完了一卷書，提着小吊子到窗外水缸中去汲水，走近一看，缸的水已經結成了冰，冰上更補了一層雪，我那時就略不思索，用常留水的鉛皮勺子，把冰上的雪留在銅吊子裏，回去在燈上煮着，一回見滾了冲喝，覺得比平常更好了幾分。</p>
<p>元宵是燈節，但在我們家鄕下，燈是從除夕就掛起的。一年，也是因爲我對燈的特別愛好，在我家口字形屋子四面游廊上掛着二十四盞紅紗燈。同時更在內廳上燒着六對罩有明角罩的蠟燭。那時大人們都在屋子裏準備着每年過年時必要的東西，我一個人負着要在庭心中間望，覺得雖則在幷不輝煌的屋宇，也頗有富麗氣象。</p>
<p>一講到紅紗燈，我又記起一件事了。那年是我一個親戚家的姊姊出嫁，我奉着命去喝喜酒。一向我對于坤宅的酒：是不大愛喝的。因爲花轎一出門，就顯得難堪的寂寞，這次沒有辦法，非去不可，同時出嫁的人，又是和我頗爲要好的人，在這種情形之下，我自然只有直着喉嚨喝酒，果然，不多一會就醉得不成樣子了。</p>
<p>親戚們看到我醉，就呌兩個了頭扶我回家，我的家和我親戚們的家，隔着一條頗爲冷落的街，街上燈又少，而他們家中所有的燈籠，却又全部給人們拿出幹正事了，他沒有辦法，就摘一盞掛着的紅紗燈，交給一個較小的了頭，我就扶在較大一個了頭的肩上，由一盞紅紗燈引道，慢慢的回去，當時長街寂寞，眉月娟娟，我雖則酒醉，但是感到莫名的高興，一路上低吟着「笙簫歸院落，燈火下樓台」二句，實在的，那時親戚家的十番聲，正一陣陣來呢！</p>
<h3>水災</h3>
<p>— 筱雲</p>
<p>「討厭的天，老是滴滴答答地下雨，那眞是要咱們窮人的命呀！……唉，這樣的天氣，誰又高興吃凉粉呢？」長發伯淸早起來，瞧一瞧天井裏的灰色的天空，和簷前凉粉錢般細長的雨點，他的胸膛就好像給毒箭穿過般的疼痛，暗地裏喃喃地自語着。</p>
<p>長發伯是個年紀約莫五六十歲的老頭兒，禿着頭，枸僂着背脊，黝黑的皮　，額頭上深深地印烙着許多深刻的縐紋，像樹幹的年輪似的，記載着他的生活的勞苦。他每年除了固定地在村口種植着十幾畝旱田足以稍稍維持一家的口食之外，一到田裏的事情做完之後，能得一點兒空閑的時間，他就和兒子做着應時的小生意，賺些微利來帮助家裏的開銷。比如說，現在是炎熱的五月天，他就做起凉粉來，挑着担子，在村上往來地呌賣着。</p>
<p>「爸——爸——現在外……面……面的勢頭眞是有點不……好！今早我從村前的溪墘經過，水漲得快要翻過堤岸了，洪濁得像土泥！」他的大兒子阿根，挑着擔子從外面踅進來，滿身的衣服，都給雨水打濕得淋淋漓漓了，成串的水珠在褲沿底下滴滴答答的滴着。氣喘喘地說今天一點生意也沒有，走了二個鄕村，賈不到一角錢！剛後芝祥叔的誧門口經過，芝祥叔正在督責他的兒子搬運店裏的貨物，他說：「這次的溪水可漲得很厲害，又迅速，那是十幾年來不曾瞧到的。想來上頭的溪洪可不小的啊！」爸爸，我看，這次可免不了又要發生水災了！」兒子阿根一面說着，一面把擔子挑到門邊的窗下。</p>
<p>長發伯下意識地抬起頭兒瞧一下窗外的天空，長長的噓了一口氣，低沉着腦袋，退坐到床沿上，默默地抽着他的旱烟。</p>
<p>「爸爸，我們這裏也是低地，應當先為凖備，不然洪水一來，家裏的東西，可來不及搬走了。」他開始地拉出床庇下的那隻缺了一隻耳朶的破木箱。</p>
<p>長發伯還是默靜得一聲不響，腦袋比前更加低沉。他想起村口的十幾畝旱田，正結着肥滿的稻實的旱田啊！他不斷地想像着水災過後，稻田不是還給洪水衝壞嗎？那時，秋收已吿絕望，那末，家裏的衣食要到什麼地方去籌措呢？想到這裏，彷彿眼前就立着一個面目猙獰的魔鬼，伸長着牠的毛葺葺的巨臂，捉摸到他的腦袋來。使他恐懼得全身起了疙瘩，不敢再想像下去了。</p>
<p>「唉！天公旣不想活人，就是逃，也沒有地方可以逃得的！」長發伯拉長着嗓音地哼着。</p>
<p>天井裏的雨，已是越下越大了，簷前的雨水，淙淙潺潺的流着。</p>
<p>陡然地，一陣鑼聲從村裏傳進來，雄着一片喧嘩嘈亂的聲音。</p>
<p>「大家出來恊力守堤呀，堤快要崩潰了！」</p>
<p>這聲音剛過了不久，「嘩……」的一聲，宏亮的從村外傳進來，分明地堤已給溪洪衝債了。</p>
<p>「逃命呀！……快點逃命呀！」傳進來一陣悽凉的慘呌！</p>
<p>「爸爸，我們逃吧，快一點地逃吧！遲一點就來……」他的兒子忙走過出扶着他的父親。</p>
<p>「孩子，要逃到什麼地方去呢？……」</p>
<h3>愛慾</h3>
<p>— 新綠</p>
<p>是芍藥花開的季節。</p>
<p>跨進了御花園，董小宛的心就卜卜地跳個不住，她把頭低下了，只管往胸前縮；眼睛朝着地，畏怯地幾乎要閉攏額上微微沁出來，她疑心自己在蒸籠裏打滾。</p>
<p>她一方面祖憂着她那胃充太監混進宮內的丈夫冒辟彊長此逗留下去，准要給雍正帝看出了破綻；另一方面又感到無可推卸的負疚底愧怍，不是麼？她原和他約定在淸明節出奔的，如今呢？端陽節也早已過去了，她却還是依戀在深宮裏，往日信誓旦旦的密語，都化作了空幻的泡影，雖說宮衛森嚴，一時難於下手，但自己的缺乏勇氣，不肯扯碎了眼前她和雍正帝底愛的保壘，剛决地從他底懷抱裏飛去，終是鐵一般的事實。使她良心上蒙到嚴重的誅伐，神經抽搐得星星作痛；宛如有隻驚鳥的鐵足鈎，在勾動着她底魂靈。</p>
<p>「天啊！你再不拯拔我，我要被這種矛盾生活磨折死了」！她輕輕歎了一口氣，把自己底右腕紆舒地從雍正帝底窩支裏伸回來，微抬起雙眼望過去，已見丈夫胃辟彊在九龍亭前跪接着。</p>
<p>「怎麼啦？小宛」！</p>
<p>「陛下，我覺得人世終不過是齣短促的悲劇，當生命之泉源洒畢最後的一滴時？誰也免不了撒手化作塵埃；生前的熱情，愛慾，都片片歸眞於太虛了。怎不令人心沮」！</p>
<p>「啊，小宛，你爲什麼老是這樣的感傷呢？你苦惱，連帶也使我受到無窮的痛楚；人原祗是人啊！小宛，請你別再胡思吧！你看芍藥花是開得何等茂盛，我們且來痛飲三杯」。雍正帝緊緊地</p>
<p>倚偎着她，眼眶裏微微有些滋潤，眞　的傾愛，給予她無限的同情底溫存；她感激得幾乎要哭出來了。</p>
<p>細碎的脚步聲，驚動了樹上的小麻雀兒，吱的一聲飛去，整個的空間，歸於死一般的沉寂。</p>
<p>進了九龍亭，酒席已端整好了，冒辟彊很謹飭的侍立在旁邊，伺候着；臉上較前益發的瘦削了，董小宛心中覺得老大的不忍，想想他從前本也是位養尊處優慣的讀書公子，只爲不甘自己的妻子被奪，跋涉奔波受盡了人間痛苦，如今我在上面享樂飲酒，他卻奴顏屈膝地在階下奉承，不禁使她湧起一陣濃烈的酸楚來：</p>
<p>「啊」！</p>
<p>「啊」！</p>
<p>金葉鳳尾酒，</p>
<p>海棠紫玉杯，</p>
<p>芝蘭魚，</p>
<p>龍肝肉，</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>物體在她眼前搖晃，一個十個，千個……她威到頭腦奇異的輕飄，天似乎快要坍倒下來，望望雍正，望望冒辟疆，他們的臉都是特前的蠢，夢般的幻覺，擴張起來，大，大，…大得像一幅雲氈，把她直托起來，她似在空中御風而行，一剎時又跌落在芍藥花叢裏，殷紅的顏色，使她感到了未來命運的恐懼，似乎又見雍正的臉變得猙獰可怕，漸漸地他張開了血盆大口要來吞噬自己的模樣，她急忙奔趨向冒辟疆求援，不料胃辟彊也手執剛刀惡狠狠由對面撲上來，她沒命地往旁邊逃，忽然天昏地黑，鬼泣神呌，無數幢幢黑影一齊向她攔住去路，說時遲，那時快，背後剛刀早已直扑而下，她哇的一聲哭倒了。</p>
<p>「醒來」！</p>
<p>「醒來」！</p>
<p>陽光驟然昏黃下去，天陰沉得使人</p>
<p>發抖，蜜蜂嗡嗡的呌，芍藥花似乎</p>
<p>變成暗紫色了。</p>
<h3>芒種</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>「鄉村四月閒人少，纔了蠶桑又整禾」；廢曆四月在鄉村中，簡直是一個農家的最忙季節，而同時也是一個最有希望，最可寶貴的季節。在這個時候，無論男婦大小，每個人都有他們應做的工作：尤其是在江南的農村中，茶葉蠶事纔罷，花菓田作接着又來；只要等天一下小滿水，大家便須浸穀種，做秧田，一到近芒種，大家又須準備挿秧了。</p>
<p>阿順伯今天一早起身，他就到柱子取下那本「陰陽合曆通書」來看：他識的字雖然不多，可是瞎子看長行，更其是一年間的大小節令是他所熟習的。他翻到了四月份：</p>
<p>「呣！四月小，五月大，四月二十是小滿，五月初七交芒種，小滿水雖不發，然而穀種總得浸的，自家的穀種已沒有一粒，銀男還多着，且先去和他商量，借一二十斤來浸了再說。」他自己心里想着，就把曆本合上了掛在原地方了，隨後一屁股坐在門限上，抬頭望望天，天是那磨陰鬱的，可也不下雨。他隨手拿過潮烟筒，拚命的抽着，彷彿要將許多問題都要籍這抽烟中來解决它！</p>
<p>「去年直河頭外面，菱蕩子里水小，所以沒有種菱，後來改種了秈米，雖然吃了許多從未經過的苦頭，可是倒底還收到八石多蒸穀米的。但是，但是今年底水更小了，許多地方的泥塊都突現在外面：菱種雖已下好，可休想會有菱採。就是秈稻恐怕也不見得會有什麼希望的！」他的老婆剛從房里給才週歲的小毛穿了衣服出來，聽得男人提起了浸穀種的事，她就這樣嘮哩嘮叨的走向了灶扉問里去。阿順伯沒有接嘴，儘營吧折吧折的抽着潮烟，眼睛却注祝着天井里的亂石。猛然問一隻蜘蛛從屋簷上吊下來，恰巧跌在他額上，他用手去一拍，一胞漿水裂了出來，他看了看自己的手掌，那只無辜的小蜘蛛已變成了肉漿，於是在自己草鞋上擦去了手上的汚債，心里却繼續地想他的心事：</p>
<p>「蕩田種不成，山田里是休想作夢……？河浜里的水還不過尺來深，今年不會比舊年好的！將來取水的來源都斷絕了……」他老婆却搶來說了：</p>
<p>「可是不種又不行，人家全在下秧了，我們可也不能够讓幾塊田白着，好壞總要碰碰額角頭看，也許小滿水不來黃霉水早晚要發的」。</p>
<p>「等到黃霉水來已經遲了，田爿里的秧苗也好當柴燒啦」！</p>
<p>「比不發總好些，多少總有點好撈着的」．</p>
<p>「管他的，反正浸了穀再說！」他有氣無力的說着挾了一隻竹籮向銀男去借穀種去了。</p>
<p>借來了十五斤粳稻穀，他小心翼翼的走到河頭去淘了淘淸，將那些浮穀全飄了出來，在一隻淡甏里注滿了淸水，把這一籮毛穀全傾在里面，然後將它壓在天井角落里。</p>
<p>他默默地吃過了早飯，掮了一柄鋤田鐵耙，到橫田頭去做秧田；他的老婆却在家裏整理養蠶傢俱；</p>
<p>「嘿！蠶倒沒有養着，可也一樣的討手脚的。」她自語着。</p>
<p>他們養了一季蠶，却沒有見到一個繭花，現在他們一年的生活都要寄託在將來的秋收里；以前借空的，現在吃空的，以及將來需要的，都要等待秋收來補償。但是眼前給他的印象偏又太壞；使這溟遠的，渺茫的希望，終於沉在一個看不見，摸不到的深淵里面了！</p>

<h3>公使和大使的區別</h3>
<p>在近半月間，英美德日等國先後將駐華公使昇格爲大使。但一般讀者多不明瞭「公使」和「大使。的區別，所以這幾天寫信來詢問的極多，編者除分別函覆外，認爲還有公開解釋的必要，特再摘要叙述於後：</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>依照現在國際間的慣例，外交代表共分爲四個等級：第一級是大使，第二級是公使，第三級是駐使，第四級是代辦。凡派駐頭等大國的使節，必定是大使；而對於次等的國家，則僅僅派遣公使。因爲大使是本國君主或元首的代表，公使是本國政府的代表，大使的官階比公使高了一級，在國際禮儀上，派遣大使自然是客氣得多了。同時，大使可以臨時直接會晤外交當局，可要求晋謁元首，在外交聯絡上，或發生某項交涉時，確有特殊的便利。而在英美諸國，各次等國公使要晋謁駐在國的外交部長是很不容易的，事先要掛驢，無暇可以派代表接見，臨時往謁的，只能和司長參事或次長等晤談而已。在禮儀上及外交關係上，當然是比不上大使了。英美法意德日等國都是互派大使彼此往來者，因爲他們都是頭等國，所以是平等相待、但對中國却不同了。中國向來是被各國所輕視的，除了俄國在革命後和中國復交，互派大使外，各國駐華的使節還是公使，將中國當作次等國看待，這實在是一種恥辱！不久以前意大利先將駐華使節昇格爲大使，在上月間英美德日等國也先後實行駐華使節的昇格，在表面上看起來，似乎他們都已承認中國是頭等國了，是很値得慶幸的；但我們要知到各列强對華使節的昇格，並不是中國本身能力增進的結果，而爲國際間的一種外交手段。我們應該利用這種國際的情勢，振作起來，以達到名實相符，使中國能得到眞正的平等待遇的目的。這是各國對華關係轉變中一般人應有的認識。</p>
<p>編者敔事本欄向以個別答復爲主，諒爲讀者所深悉。今後更爲篇幅所限，除特別與一般人有關之問題外，僅予函覆，概不公佈。恐起誤會，特再聲明。</p>

<h3>本年度最初四個月英國汽車業概況</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>（一）國內市塲紀錄驚人　英國的汽車業。近年來本有長足的進展。而尤其是這個年頭。更是蓬勃。私用汽車的產數。第一季中打破了英國方面空前未有的紀錄。本年最初四個月內。新車的註册數。由上年同時期六六·八二四輛的紀錄。增到八三·八六六輛。不但客車。貨車的註册數。也有同樣的情形。上年同時期祗二二·五一四輛。本年增加到二四·六一二輛。我們如果把註冊的數量。作進一步的分析。那麼以馬力說來。大號汽車也顯然是增加了。二十五匹馬力以上的新車。本年的註冊數。比去年同時期增加了一半。不過事實上目前英國各廠。大量製造的新車。並不是二十五匹馬力左右的車輛。而十匹馬力的小汽車。同時。我們更可注意到英國汽車界的環境是好轉了。因爲汽車馬力稅已低减不少。多馬力汽車的所以增多當然也就爲了這個原因吧。</p>
<p>（二）國外市塲銷數激增　英國的汽車市塲本年最初四月。國內市塲有相當的發展。旣如上述。但同時海外市場。也有同樣的發展呢。尤其是大汽車。多馬力的車輛。近來出口方面。也育相當的進展。最近幾月之中。倫敦著名的車身。製造者赫潑爾　Hooper廠。有不少新車身運往國外。而日前正趕緊工作。預備把所接到的定單。先後交貨。其中像印度。奧洲西斑牙。怯國。羅馬尼亞。匃牙利。和瑞士等國。都向該廠訂購大批車身。而這種車身。內中又大部裝配羅爾魯意斯底盤的。一架特大的汽車身。裝在四十至五十匹馬力羅爾魯意斯底盤的。最近也因該廠製成交貨與西印度共和國大總統。事實上這一輛可算是鐵甲車。因爲四面都是鎗彈不入的鋼板和玻璃。雖然是這樣。但全車的重量。祗比普通的汽車重五個。</p>
<p>（三）汽車競賽成績良好　近年以來。英國的汽車。不但在銷數方面。得有相當的進展。就是在工程上也顯然比過往進步得多。單就競賽的成績說來。我們已可得到一種證據了。最近有戈貝爾公爵者。他再度駕一「靑島」牌汽車。在達都奈地方。參加汽車競賽。獲得驚人的紀錄。因此博得一般的人承認「靑鳥」牌汽車。是一種有數的汽車。競賽的時侯另外更有一輛一九〇四—五年時代製造的羅爾魯意斯舊車。十匹馬力。兩汽缸。這輛舊車。爲南開　登地方科學博物院所有。雖然已有三十歲的年齡。競賽結果。表演却非常良好。事實吿訴我們。英國的汽車。不但最近的出品。有驚人的成績。連得舊汽車。成績也不無可觀呢。</p>
<p>（四）機油催滑實地試騐　最近有一位著名的科學家魯愛氏。在勃羅克蘭地方。作一度機油的實地試騐以證機油的採用。何種方法爲最佳。而用何種機油行路較長。就用裘爾姆機油公司的出品。在魯愛氏指導之下。把限定的機油用完。實地試騐一次。試騐的時候。採用兩輛同樣的一九三五式小奧斯汀汽車。行路五百五十哩。然後終了。而結果汽缸的裏面。除了留下一層薄膜之外。並無餘油了。以速率計算。每小時行三十哩。內中一輛新車。是用最上選的機油催滑。行路九，六哩便停止。另一輛用裘爾姆機汕。行路十六哩而停止。因此。事實已吿訴我們。機油的充足。可使催滑有力。而車輛的行駛時間。也可較久呢。</p>
<p>（五）登極紀念與汽車業　整個的五月。在英國是爲了英皇喬治登極二十五週紀念而慶祝得非常熱鬧。英國各地的人們。相率到倫敦來看熟鬧。甚至海外的遊客。趁此機會。也由輪船一批批的載來。結果旅館是宣吿客滿。飯店裏的堂官在嚷着菜完啦。種種熱鬧情形。當然不一而足。汽車事業也不致例外吧。單就各地的遊客。駕了汽車來至倫敦·市內汽車的數量激增，。出租汽車。公共汽車。生意利市了三倍。便可證明汽車事業爲了英皇登極紀念。也佔不少光吧。無疑‘有甚多遊客留在倫敦時節。是需要汽車的。也許離倫敦回去的時候。也要買輛新車回去吧。因此。在倫敦各汽車行。都把大量的新車。陳列在樣子間內。十二至十四匹馬力的華克斯好車。在倫敦設有分銷處。這種車輛。最受遊客歡迎。爲了一九三四年度華克斯好車有過驚人的成績。舊汽車在市塲上。也有相當的活躍。遊客的買賣者。爲數很多呢。</p>
<p>（六）道路問題備極注意　在這種情狀之下。英國的交通。日見擁擠起來。因此。一班道路當局。對於道路安全的計劃。便不得不格外注意。使得全國的道路。達於最經濟。最安全的限度。目前最重要的問題。就在怎樣才可使道路的建築費。最經濟而將來可以最持久。據英國道路學家研究的結果。築路的材料。要有堅硬性。以壓力說。每方吋可耐二百磅重力。表面是蓋在一層小石子上面。在路面之上。細小的凹凸。都須去掉。不但要使其光澤。同時更須使其不滑溜。這樣對於安全問題。自然可增進了舊路的修築。新路的開闢。目前英國的道路當局。都在積極的進行之中。築路運動的結果。直接間接。自然也都可促進汽車事業的。</p>
<h3>汽車新訊一束</h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>主張汽車稅收用於公路　美國道路建築人會及公路展覽最近在華盛頓舉行第三十二屆年會。參加之各州市公路官員機師承築人及製造商等。總數不下五〇〇〇人。當時會衆主張。所有全國所徵之汽油稅及汽車執照捐等。均應用之於各州之道路建築。以代用於急賑或其他用途。各公路公務員稱：現在各州每年將此項稅收移用於別途者。爲數不下美金二〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。若此舉而常此以往對於公路前途危險堪虞。結果必致各州不能參加於聯邦公路計劃之經費支出。會中主要之主張爲繼續進行完全之築路設計計劇。所有路稅收入一槪用之於路政。聯邦築路經費。亦須繼續照撥云。</p>
<p>美國汽車大橋完成有期　舊金山與哇克蘭間之駛行汽車大橋。定於一九三六年十二月竣工。此橋分上下兩層。專供汽車行駛。自哇克蘭端駕車向橋前進。先過一寬闊之植樹大道。長一又四分之一英里。過徵稅之塲後。郎平易上升而達橘上層。行一九·〇〇〇尺而至中堤之猶拔伴那島。過此島嶼卽爲四鉅大塔。達西端之二英里道。再行一英里而至舊金山終點。運貨汽車行於橋下層。此橋除越過猶拔伴那島之三千尺外。其西部面均爲鉅大之隧地所貫穿。全橋則均分而爲二層。俾汽車駕駛時得保其平衡。上層行車之道有六線。下層五線。其中三線爲運貨汽車駛行道。另二線鋪設電車軌道。上層之植樹大道層。每線闊十尺。分爲兩種速度之駛行。中四線車行每小時四十五英里至五十五英里。二外線每小時爲三十英里至四十五英里。據專家估計。全橋完竣開放之第一年。卽一九三七年。其經過之車輛約計八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛。一九四三年爲一〇。〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛。一九五〇年爲一二，五〇〇，〇〇〇輛。但平均每年可以通行汽車三〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛。並無擁擠之虞。至此橋之最大優點。乃將車輛分別其駛行。各以其速度而爲之區別。</p>
<p>甘城注意道路交通安全　美國廿薩斯城之車輛肇禍數。去年爲數非細。因車輛肇禍而全生命喪失者。計一百人。今年爲數當可較少。蓋以今年同時間與去牟同時間相較。其致命案件已减至三份之二也。現甘城警務當局對於道路安全運動。策進不遺餘力。各馬路交叉要道。均有駕乘脚踏車之警察隨時巡視。醉後駕車。被警拘捕者。或罰以市農塲之苦役。或判罰鍰及吊銷駕車執照。對於駕車執照之律法。現下亦在考慮施行中。因目前對於駕車者執照管理並不如上述之嚴厲也。</p>
<p>奧地利亞汽車註册低跌　粵地利亞六〇〇，〇〇〇之人口中。祇有汽車一八，八七〇輛。若以汽車與人口相比較。則每三百居民中始有汽車一輛。此係據奧地利亞汽車俱樂部會長斯德拉生氏之估計。此外尙有運貨汽車一五，四〇〇輛。出租汽車七三〇〇輛。及機器脚踏車五一，六七〇輛。當歐洲各國汽車顯有上增之時。如德國加增百分之二十。一九三四年奧地利亞之汽車註冊數乃减少百分之三十九。此種局面之造成，聞大半由於高徵汽車稅所致云。</p>
<p>爲律斯車長途行駛成績　近有署名ＭＣ者在海峽回聲報刋載一文，盛稱其檳榔嶼新加坡間之汽車旅行。證明馬律斯車之經濟牢固。其大意爲余前於檳榔購得一馬律斯八虹車。駛行已六〇〇英里。决於假日作新加坡之旅行，乃於某星期六之晨八時四十五分。離勃蓋茂太甲而赴新加坡。途問未曾停頓。於正午十二時到達伊賓。下午一時離伊寶。晚六時誇拉侖布到達。其時行程之時間爲七小時又四十五分。汽油消耗量爲五加侖半。汽缸油無。次晨余於八時出發。及至下午六時一刻卽抵新加坡。是爲星期日之傍晚也。行駛時間八小時半。汽油六加侖。汽缸油無。除余爲全程間之駕駛者外。另有搭客三人。行李一百磅。車行極佳。並無障礙發生。回程取道馬刺甲。多增一客。行李亦增五十磅。余於星期二晨八時五十分離新加坡。下午一時達茂阿。下午二時半再行。晚七時到達誇拉侖布。行駛時間爲八時又二十分鐘。汽油消耗量六加侖。汽缸油無。翌晨八時離誇拉侖布。下午一時達伊竇。五時一刻返至勃蓋茂太甲。行駛時間七小時又四十五分鐘。汽油消耗量五加侖半。汽缸油無。全程來往中此車毫無障礙發生。機件方面亦無需校正。故修理之件未曾手觸。登山時均用頭擋。除在孟丁及太平余改至二擋。余非自誇。余駕駛汽車垂三十年。敢誠實言之。一九三五年式之馬律師八缸車。蓋爲小車中之最佳者也。並感謝納菲爵士此車裝有低壓汽胎輪。行駛甚穩。並用伐根滑油爲滑潤之用。離新加坡前。引擎櫃中已見乾燥。乃注以半加侖之油。此車雖行一三〇〇英里之長途。引擎中未加以半加侖之油。蓋因無需耳。至勃蓋茂太甲時試之油仍滿櫃。汽油之消耗量每加侖約行四十六英里。余意以此次車上之載客及行李計之。蓋甚屬良佳也。故余之忠吿。乃爲「購一馬律斯。旣無障礙。又得滿意。」</p>
<h3>若干饒有興味之福特統計</h3>

<p>美國汽車營業。覇佔世界市塲有年。但當一九三二年。世界不景氣影響所及。汽車事業亦一落千丈。年來世界經濟窮困稍蘇。汽車營業。亦有起色。其貿易總數。據專家統計。一九三二年爲美金八二，一八五，一〇〇元。一九三三年爲九三，九六八，三八三元。稍有增加。一九三四年爲一九八，三一四，四八五五元。突破最近記錄。但較黃金時代一九三〇年之二九八，六五二，〇四八元。猶有遜色。</p>
<p>南美諸國。售出客運汽車最多。蓋其人民富庶。路面亦佳。大半係水門汀及柏油路。故人民樂於購車以代步。其他如阿根廷日本瑞士英國各國。售出亦復不少。載重汽車以日本印度澳洲等處。售出最多。去年日本且一躍而居第一位。夫載重汽車。爲戰爭中必需工具。舉凡運兵運糧運械。一切賴之。日本購入大批載重汽車。其居心可知。</p>

First, Prime Minister Okada explained the Hebei issue based on a report from the Army, saying that at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, He Yingqin notified that all of Japan's demands had been fully accepted and a satisfactory resolution had been reached. However, post-settlement measures may require a considerable amount of time.

Then, Minister of Commerce Machida reported on the results of his inspection in the Nagoya area. The meeting adjourned at 11:10 AM. (Dentsu dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada reported at today's cabinet meeting that He Yingqin formally notified the Japanese military at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th that he had agreed to accept all conditions, so the Hebei incident has come to a conclusion. (Japan United Press dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Vice Minister Hashimoto visited Chief Cabinet Secretary Shirane this morning to report on the Hebei issue, saying that the Chinese side has completely accepted the Japanese military's demands and a satisfactory solution can be reported. The rumor of re-negotiating a military agreement is not accurate. (Japan United Press dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Foreign Press Commentary on the Hebei Incident</h3>
<p>(London) The Times editorial said that the news from Beiping and Tokyo has clearly indicated that the Japanese militarists have defeated Hirota and the diplomats. If Hirota's ambition to seek Sino-Japanese understanding is not merely a formal understanding, then Hirota must be greatly disturbed by this. The Chinese politicians who believe that friendship with Japan is necessary for China's revival must also feel deeply uneasy. Japan's military advance cannot reduce the anxiety of other countries with interests in the Far East. They will think that the Japanese military will do what it wants. The Japanese military is very much inclined to regard itself as an inspector of its own Foreign Ministry and other administrative organs. (Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail's editorial today said that Japan's de facto annexation of the most important province of North China is a continuation of the policy that began four years ago when Japan seized Shenyang. Such actions would not have been difficult to prevent four years ago, but the British government tacitly approved Japan's first act of aggression. British leaders previously harbored the idea that the Japanese would drive out the Reds for us, and secretly rejoiced. Now, seeing Japan's southward advance with the aim of driving out British trade and influence in China, they are frightened and uneasy. And the authorities have sent Sir Ross to Nanjing to investigate the economic situation, hoping to reverse the trend.</p>
<p>The Daily News reported that the British government's dispatch of Sir Ross to China undoubtedly shows some fear on the part of the British government regarding the danger of the situation and Britain's difficult fate in this situation. But it is too late now. China is now in a position where it cannot accept advice from any party other than one. This matter is extremely serious in China, but in Western countries, its severity is only slightly less. (Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The right-wing newspaper Le Jour and the socialist newspaper Le Populaire both criticized the current dispute between China and Japan. Le Jour said, "Even if Japan occupies the city of Beiping, the nationality to which the city belongs, especially the Chinese nation, will not perish as a result. Westerners believe that China is in decline, which is an exaggeration. It should be known that Chinese history is full of chaos, disintegration, and the entry of foreign races, and after each adversity, China can exert its strength, restore its homeland, and reappear in history, not only without losing a bit of its hair, but also assimilating the victors. Is it not true of the Turks, Mongols, and Manchus? Although these people once ruled China, they were ultimately overcome by the Chinese. How do we know that Japan will not follow in their footsteps and be controlled by China?" Le Populaire stated, "What Japan is doing is implementing a Pan-Asian Monroe Doctrine based on the plan advocated by former Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi in his 1927 memorial, for the benefit of its own country. The weakness and incompetence of the League of Nations is the first manifestation of the weakness and incompetence of European countries. Japan took the opportunity to act boldly and without scruples. Alas," etc. (Havas dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Newspapers have criticized the Sino-Japanese situation in Hebei a great deal. Even those who have always been friendly to Japan are now expressing indignation at Japan's actions in Hebei. (Reuters dispatch from the 11th) The Manchester Guardian editorial today said that the actions of the Japanese army are what Japan is doing without hesitation. Japan has only one policy towards China, which is the policy of the Twenty-One Demands of 1915. This behavior will not change because of Japan's repeated declarations. Except for Russia, no country in the East or West seems to be able to stop it. (Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<h3>Shang Zhen Visits Foreign Consuls in Tianjin</h3>

(Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ji Rukung, Wei Jian, and Hu Yuan came to Tianjin together by car at midnight on the 11th. Shang Zhen's troops, the 11th Regiment, arrived in Yangliuqing from Beiping on the 11th. (Special dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding China's League of Nations membership fees, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously instructed Guo Taiqi, the chief representative attending the League of Nations General Assembly, to negotiate with the Secretariat of the General Assembly to request a reduction, which was approved by the General Assembly.

<p>(1) Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, Acting Minister Tao of the Ministry of Interior, and Chairman of the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee reported on the review of the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee's submission proposing to tentatively define the scope and types of antiquities. After careful study, it was believed that the scope and types of these tentative antiquities were only of a general nature. Therefore, the word "outline" was added to the title to identify them.

<h3>The 25th Division Transferred to Shaanxi for Bandit Suppression; Troops Stationed in Beiyuan Began Transporting South Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to official sources, because the area occupied by the Red bandits in northern Shaanxi is extensive, covering several counties, and because transportation is inconvenient and the distribution of encirclement and suppression forces is uneven, the bandit disaster has not been completely eliminated. In order to quickly suppress the bandits and prevent them from spreading, the Beiping Military Affairs Commission issued an order on the 10th to transfer the 25th Division to Shaanxi for joint suppression. It is reported that a brigade of the division stationed in Beiyuan began moving on the 11th, transporting south. Also, the 2nd Division stationed in Nanyuan was ordered by the Military Affairs Commission on the 10th to move to the Henan-Anhui border area to jointly suppress the remaining bandits.

<p>(Hong Kong) After Hu Hanmin's departure abroad, a number of key figures from the right-wing, such as Zou Lu, are rumored to be resigning. (11th Dispatch) Chen Jitang telegraphed Bai Chongxi, inviting him to Guangdong to discuss military and political affairs. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Political circles still claim that Hu Hanmin's trip to Europe is purely for medical treatment, leading to a sharp decline in the value of the Guangdong currency against the Hong Kong dollar. Bankers say one of the reasons for the decline is Hong Kong's ban on silver exports, which will result in a large number of silver coins flowing into Guangzhou. Today, the premium on Guangdong currency against the Hong Kong dollar has risen from 40 cents to 45 cents per dollar, and the trend seems likely to continue. According to reliable sources, leaders of the Southwest Political Council are currently holding a meeting to discuss how to deal with the new situation after Hu Hanmin's departure. Many believe that the hope of cooperation between Nanjing and Guangdong has never been better than it is today. However, what will actually develop remains a matter of speculation.

<h3>The Significance of the French Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The French parliament interferes in everything, big or small, related to government affairs, unlike the British parliament, which only sets the general direction of policy and leaves the cabinet responsible for execution, allowing for flexibility in political affairs. Recently, French Prime Minister Flandin-Poincaré considered the issues of maintaining the stability of the franc and balancing the budget to be urgent and repeatedly requested full financial powers from the parliament, albeit with a deadline of the end of October. However, this is an unusual move that affects the fundamental relationship between the government and the parliament. The members of parliament naturally did not easily grant the government this full authority. Therefore, the successive collapses of cabinets are not surprising.</p>
<p>The French people love freedom and value democracy. Therefore, the political ideologies and vested interests of the members of parliament are unusually diverse, forming a situation of numerous parties. From the far-right monarchists to the far-left communists, they can all coexist in the same hall. When the government wants to form a new cabinet, it is as complex and mysterious as assembling a tangram. Everyone is scheming and fighting. If it can reconcile the interests of several parties to gain a temporary majority in parliament, then the cabinet is formed. Otherwise, even a minor issue can affect the whole situation. This is the crux of the instability of French cabinets, which anyone with basic political knowledge can explain. Laval has now recruited figures from the Radical Socialist Party, the Socialist Party, the New Socialist Party, the Left Republican Party, the Left Democratic Party, the Republican Democratic Party, and the Central Republican Party to form the so-called Left Republican cabinet. This allowed the financial powers bill, which Flandin-Poincaré failed to pass, to be passed smoothly by both houses of parliament. The reason is that the left and center parties in the French parliament were wary of the public opinion outside, which could no longer tolerate the situation, and the eager attempts of the monarchists and communists. Therefore, they had to temporarily grant the government the power to oversee finances to avoid the imminent dangers. Laval based his calculations on adapting to the times and slightly displayed his political skills, thus achieving success.</p>
<p>From this, we get a concept: that the relationship between the French cabinet and parliament has been invisibly modified. According to the 1875 constitution, the French president has the power to dissolve the parliament with the consent of the Senate. However, since this law was abused once by the monarchist President MacMahon in 1877 and failed, it has become a dead letter for more than 50 years. The French cabinet cannot dissolve the parliament like the British cabinet. Therefore, British and French democracy have different systems of cabinet and parliament. However, we have seen the political turmoil triggered by the Stavisky Affair in Bayonne last December, which led to the successive collapses of the Daladier and Chautemps cabinets, until the 70-year-old retiring President Doumergue came out of retirement and calmed the situation, and a so-called "party truce" cabinet was formed. Recently, the financial panic has also created a similar cabinet crisis. Both Flandin and Poincaré's cabinets were uneasy in their positions. Until Laval made another attempt and finally formed a so-called transitional cabinet. The two incidents show that when the French cabinet formation problem reaches a dead end, the parliament has to compromise. Otherwise, the parliament can overthrow the cabinet at will, and the cabinet will never have the opportunity to dissolve the parliament, and their relationship will fall into bias. If the government and parliament always insist on their own positions, and the deadlock cannot be broken, and the situation worsens, then a coup is inevitable. The result will not only be a stagnation of democracy, but also a shaking of the republican system itself. Therefore, the final turning point is to allow the legislative and executive branches to fully play their role in "correction and balance." It can also be said to be a manifestation of the spirit of French democracy.</p>
<p>Last spring, after Doumergue formed a cabinet, he believed that the relationship between the French government and parliament was not as flexible as that of the British government, so he proposed a so-called constitutional reform compromise plan, namely: (1) Within one year of the general election, the president can dissolve the parliament with the consent of the Senate. (2) After one year of the general election, the president can dissolve the parliament without the consent of the Senate. This plan ultimately failed due to the opposition of the Radical Socialist Party in the Chamber of Deputies. The French parliament believes that it is the representative of national sovereignty. It is incompatible with the French national character to permanently grant the executive branch such great power with dictatorial tendencies. The current financial powers bill stipulates that the decrees issued by the government must be submitted to parliament for ratification before June 1 next year, which is different from the previous plan in terms of permanence and temporality.</p>
<h3>British Economic Advisor Comes to China, London Circles Delighted, Expressing a Determined Resolve to Assist Our Country, US and France Will Send Experts Simultaneously</h3>
<p>(London) British financial and business circles related to China are extremely pleased that Sir Otto Niemeyer, chief economic advisor to the British government, has been ordered to go to China, regarding it as the most important step taken by Britain in the Far East for many years. This appointment represents Britain's determination to truly assist China, which is different from merely offering lip service in the past. Britain's interests in the Far East should cause Britain to take some action. Both houses of Parliament and other important parties have long advocated this. What Sir Otto Niemeyer will do after arriving in China is not yet known, but his mission is to plan a way to financially assist China on a permanently beneficial basis. This is an open secret. Furthermore, Niemeyer's appointment was not announced until the United States and France agreed to send experts in similar positions. There is reason to believe that the Ministry of Finance's position implies that the Ministry of Finance must create its statement. The newspapers are also very welcome to this appointment, because this move is a sign that the authorities recognize that the position of the Chinese government is becoming increasingly consolidated. The gradual progress of the relationship between Nanjing and Guangdong is also satisfactory to people here. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was learned here today that the United States is currently considering sending an expert to China to investigate the financial situation. This statement is made even more powerful by Britain's recent proposal for international aid to China. If it can be realized, it will be carried out simultaneously with Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit to China. Although Niemeyer's purpose in going to China is to discuss international loans, it is reported that he will also study in detail the impact of the US silver policy on China's finances and commerce. People here generally believe that other countries besides Britain and the United States are also very interested, and are all preparing to send personnel to China to investigate and study. When the Senate was debating international loans to China, Democratic Senator Lewis strongly opposed the United States' participation, arguing that the United States' foreign loans have never had good results.

<h3>Soviet Border Guard Killed by Japanese Army, Russia Lodges Protest but Japan Claims it Occurred in Manchuria</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Japan, Raivert, lodged a protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding the incident of Japanese-Manchu troops invading the Soviet border on June 3, saying that Japanese-Manchu troops lurked on the Soviet border and attacked two Red Army soldiers guarding the border. When the two were 1,700 meters away from the border, one of them rushed to the outpost for help under fire. When the Soviet rescue team arrived at the scene of the attack, only some ammunition boxes, a few shells, and bloodstains were found. The other Red Army soldier was obviously killed or injured and taken into Manchuria, as there were also horseshoe tracks visible. Raivert demanded that the criminals be investigated and punished, and that the same violations be prohibited in the future. (11th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Tonight, the newspaper reported that, regarding the recent incident of Japanese-Manchu troops invading the Soviet border and killing a Soviet border guard, the Soviet ambassador to Tokyo has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The protest letter stated that at 9:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, Japanese-Manchu troops invaded the Soviet border to a distance of one mile, and then opened fire on two Soviet border guards. At that time, the Soviet border guards did not return fire, but only sent one person to report to the rear. When the rear reinforcements arrived, they only saw bloodstains on the ground, and the guard was no longer there, indicating that the guard had been killed by the Japanese-Manchu troops and then dragged into "Manchukuo." (11th National News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the conflict between Japanese and Russian troops near Mishan on the eastern border of Russia and Manchuria on June 3, Reich, Counselor of the Japanese-Russian Embassy, visited Togo, Director of the European and Asian Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, on the 10th to protest and demand the extradition of several Russian soldiers captured by the Japanese army. The Foreign Ministry issued a statement at noon on the 11th as follows: According to a bulletin from the South Manchurian Embassy, the Japanese army garrison was patrolling inside Manchuria on June 3 when it was suddenly shot at by Soviet Russian Red Army soldiers who had invaded Manchuria. The Japanese army had no choice but to return fire and drive the Russian soldiers out of the country. At that time, one wounded soldier (who later died) and two military horses were abandoned at a location 200 meters inside the border. It is clear that this incident occurred within Manchuria, and the Japanese army's response was legitimate self-defense. On the 5th, the Japanese military authorities ordered the chief of the Harbin special affairs agency to protest to the Russian consul general in Harbin, but the Russian consul general has reserved his reply to date, citing that he has not received a report. The Foreign Ministry has now instructed the South Manchurian Embassy to conduct negotiations on the ground to seek a resolution. (11th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hull Warns That Some Warlike Countries Will Cause a Second World War</h3>
<p>US Secretary of State Cordell Hull issued a warning in a speech at the graduation ceremony of the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, saying that "some countries" tend to flaunt their military power or military personnel control foreign policy, which will be a precursor to the First World War. Hull also said, "We have seen many times now that military personnel control the foreign policy of a country. Therefore, all countries that can recognize this as harming international peace should clearly reveal the culprits to the public and sternly warn them with all their strength that war is dangerous and self-destructive. Today, we see that the warlords of some countries, like before the European war, are striving to glorify military achievements, so that the public only knows that military achievements are the only goal. These military personnel are reorganizing the military, making the country's productive forces on the verge of paralysis. One country increases its military, and other countries follow suit. The cycle continues until economic suicide stops." Hull's remarks were made at a time when the Japanese army was acting rampantly in North China, which is worthy of attention. The US State Department has been closely watching the Far East issue recently, and its anxiety is still hidden. It is generally believed that Hull's speech today is the first acknowledgement of this anxiety. (10th National News Dispatch)</p>
<p>Carlisle, USA - US Secretary of State Cordell Hull said in a speech at the graduation ceremony of the Pennsylvania Army War College today that the unabated expansion of armaments is harmful to world peace, economic stability, and international well-being. The United States' policy is to assist others in preventing war and maintaining peace without abandoning American principles. The domestic armament work of some countries has now reached the point of destroying their domestic productive forces. All countries that understand this danger must loudly shout to those who are preparing for war to make them aware that war is not auspicious. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Therefore, we have deeply realized the necessity of reorganizing armaments, and what we are currently doing is only for self-defense." Shih also praised the understanding between China and the United States. At the end of the graduation ceremony, Grinnell College awarded Ambassador Shih an honorary doctorate.

<h3>German Propaganda Minister Says Cannot Attack Soviet Russia, But Suspicious of Mutual Assistance Pacts</h3>
<p>(London) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave an interview to a reporter from the News Chronicle in Berlin, stating that "Germany cannot attack the Soviet Union and does not want to attack the Soviet Union. Germany believes in non-aggression pacts, but cannot help but be suspicious of mutual assistance pacts. The conclusion of mutual assistance pacts stipulates that French and Soviet troops are allowed to enter German territory under the guise of assisting Germany in defending against aggressor countries. This kind of pact is not what we need. We believe that all international disputes should be localized as much as possible. If various international disputes cannot be resolved by a portion of countries on their own, but must be resolved collectively by all countries, then there will be no possibility of localization. As far as Germany is concerned, we are prepared to enable France and Germany to gain a better understanding. However, the volatile nature of French domestic politics is a difficult problem. To overcome the centuries-old grudges between France and Germany, powerful figures are needed." (11th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Greek Restoration Issue, Although General Election Results Have Been Announced, Future Situation Still Uncertain</h3>
<p>Athens - The royalists suffered a major setback in this general election, winning only seven seats out of three hundred. However, it is not yet known whether the issue of restoration will be seriously affected as a result. It is still uncertain whether the government intends to hold a referendum to vote on the issue. Rumor has it that Army Chief General Kondylis and three other cabinet members are strongly supporting the republic, while the remaining cabinet members, supported by 70 members of parliament, will raise the issue in parliament when it convenes. It is also heard that after the government submits a formal resignation letter for the general election, it will attach a reservation to the oath to the republic. If this is true, then the issue of restoration will inevitably be raised in parliament. At the same time, Prince Nicholas of Greece told a reporter from a Parisian newspaper that, judging from the results of this general election, the Greek people strongly support the restoration. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens - The Greek National Assembly election was completed yesterday. The final results of the election have now been confirmed. The Tsaldaris cabinet has achieved a great victory, with the government party winning a total of 287 seats out of the 300 seats in the National Assembly, while the opposition only won 13 seats. However, it is not sufficient to estimate the strength of the various parties based solely on the number of seats obtained. The method of voting in this election was that the list of the party with the most votes in each district was used as the list proposed by each candidate. If the number of votes obtained is the highest, but does not exceed half, all can be elected, while the lists of other parties with the second-highest number of votes are all invalidated. As a result, although the Communist Party obtained a considerable number of votes, none of them were elected as representatives to the National Assembly. The royalists of the Metaxas faction only won a few seats. Judging from the proportion of votes obtained, it should have been far more than this. In addition, the former republican parties did not participate in the vote. Therefore, to understand the situation of the strength of the various parties, it is necessary to compare the number of votes obtained by each party with the number of votes abandoned in order to get a general view. However, since the extreme right-wing opposition party has almost no foothold in the National Assembly, the Tsaldaris cabinet can absolutely take any action in freedom. This cannot be said to be a major victory for the government. (10th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>London's Strong Financial Resources</h3>

<p>(Athens) According to the official figures released, the total number of people who participated in the National Assembly election the day before yesterday was approximately 1,032,000. However, this number is subject to change after verification. In the 1933 National Assembly election, the number of voters reached 1,144,000. The number of votes obtained by each party in this election is not yet clear. In Athens, there are 93,000 registered voters, but only 40,000 participated in the voting. The government won 34,500 votes in Athens, the royalists won 12,713 votes, the communists won 9,304 votes, and there were 3,370 invalid votes. According to various newspapers, a referendum to resolve the issue of the political system will be held around September. People are now looking forward to the National Assembly representatives swearing an oath to the republican constitution. The trend of the National Assembly on the issue of the political system can be seen from the oath of each representative. (11th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chaco Armistice Agreement, Belligerents Recognize Stimson Doctrine</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Chaco War settlement is issued in the form of a protocol, stipulating that the two countries concerned shall end the armistice within 12 days, negotiate within 20 days, and the countries concerned shall approve the agreement. Within 90 days, the armies of the countries concerned shall be demobilized separately, and the countries concerned shall conduct direct negotiations within 90 days. If direct negotiations fail at that time, the dispute shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague for judgment. This protocol is divided into five articles. Article 1 stipulates that after Bolivia and Paraguay accept the protocol, the President of Argentina should immediately convene a peace conference to cooperate with the countries concerned during direct negotiations and continue direct negotiations until there is a possibility of success. If direct negotiations fail, the peace conference should wait until the dispute is submitted to the Hague Tribunal before it can end its work. The countries concerned should also discuss river transport and commercial relations at the peace conference.</p>
<p>Article 2 establishes the terms of the armistice and stipulates that neutral countries shall send military delegations to the battlefields to survey and determine the current positions of the belligerents and guarantee them. The warring countries should agree on a date to exchange prisoners, suspend attacks, and not add to their armaments.</p>
<p>Article 3 stipulates that the warring armies shall be demobilized within 90 days and reduce their troop strength to 5,000 men.</p>
<p>Article 4 stipulates that the belligerents restate their acceptance of the declaration issued by former US Secretary of State Stimson on August 3, 1932.</p>
<p>Article 5 stipulates the procedures to be adopted by the warring armies to cease fire and when the protocol takes effect. However, the ceasefire date has not been determined.</p>

<h3>British-Italian Dispute Over Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Rome - Prime Minister Mussolini gave a passionate speech here today to the Blackshirt members of Romagna, saying, "We have made all preparations for war or peace. We will use our strength to lead the nation to greatness. If necessary, we must be able to take up arms and defend the country and glorify the national flag." During his speech, Mussolini indirectly satirized Britain, alluding to "so-called foreign speeches," but his ban on Italian newspapers from engaging in anti-British propaganda is still strictly enforced. (10th National News Dispatch)</p>
<p>Batavia - The Italian government wants to recruit thousands of local workers here to build roads in Italian Somaliland in Africa, but the Dutch East Indies government has refused, believing that this move is in conflict with the government's recruitment policy. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome - According to Italian newspapers here, King Haile Selassie of Abyssinia recently traveled to Harar province and gave a speech to the Muslim chiefs. On the one hand, he promised to reform the administration of the province. On the other hand, he called himself the only emperor in Africa and the leader of all Africans, including Africans under white rule, who he also wanted to lead, because these white people want to attack not only our religion but also your religion. Italian newspapers believe that the reason why the Abyssinian King made such remarks is that the Egyptians and Muslims in Harar Province have deep resentment, and he wants to use the province as a base to counter Italian Somaliland and to salvage the historical alienation of the Muslims in the province towards him. He must first harmonize the emotions of the Egyptian Muslim residents, and then generally win over the people of the province. (11th National News Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Uses Airplanes for Sowing</h3>
<p>(TASS News Agency, Rostov, May 16th) The collective farm in the Kuban region of the North Caucasus first pioneered the use of airplanes for sowing rice crops in 1931. At that time, the sowing area was 13 hectares. The experimental results were very good, so it is now being carried out on a large scale. This method of sowing is very beneficial because, as spring begins and the soil is still very moist, airplanes can immediately start working. Moreover, experience has proven that most of these early sowings yield good results. This sowing method is mainly used in Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and the Volga River region for planting wheat and oats. Currently, sufficient materials for sowing have been prepared, and the area sown by airplanes this year will reach 100,000 hectares. This sowing method has yielded good results in the past, and the dense seedlings now emerging are also proof of this fact.</p>

<p>(London) The Daily News sharply criticized Mussolini's recent statement that Italy can disregard foreign public opinion. The newspaper believes that while Italy is free to increase its troops in East Africa, it should quickly cease such saber-rattling and aggressive rhetoric. Mr. Mussolini believes that Italy alone has the right to decide its own interests, but the fact is not so. Eden has already pointed out that, according to the revised treaty of 1906, all matters concerning Abyssinia should be consulted among Britain, France, and Italy. Both Italy and Abyssinia are members of the League of Nations, and disputes between the two countries should be resolved peacefully by the League of Nations. Finally, the newspaper stated that if Italy truly believes, as Mussolini claims, that international public opinion can be ignored and international obligations can be discarded, it will make a huge mistake. (National News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>( ) Various newspapers commented on the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, all expressing concerns held by public opinion and urging Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to respect international obligations and not act rashly. The Daily News reported that Mussolini's speech, regardless of its goal, is insufficient to reassure people. Last week, during Prime Minister Baldwin's speech, he said, "Dictatorial governments can take unexpected actions. I hope his words are not true. In the past, countries occupied colonies, only seeking to achieve their goals and not bothering to choose the means. It is undeniable. However, since the Kellogg-Briand Pact prohibits all wars as an instrument of national policy and advocates for peaceful means to resolve disputes, the current situation is vastly different from the past. Moreover, Italy has already accepted the League of Nations' mediation, so how can it go back on its word, or even challenge public opinion?" (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Rome: Prime Minister Mussolini's speech has caused a great international reaction. Le Temps of Paris stated that Mussolini's speech was indeed a military address, intended to consolidate the principle that "Italy will seek its own salvation" and to express the strong will of the Italian people. Italy is fully prepared to deal with a difficult situation until the Italian-Abyssinian issue is resolved. The Prospect criticized Mussolini's speech, saying that Abyssinia has created a serious political situation. France has no direct relationship with this, but this dispute may affect France's policy. Rome considers the Italian-Abyssinian conflict a domestic issue, while other parties consider it an international issue. This difference of opinion may cause a serious dispute. The London Morning Post published Mussolini's speech and explained it, saying that Mussolini's speech indicated that Italy is determined to act as a judge and wants to be sure of the future outcome. The newspapers of Madrid also unanimously reported Mussolini's speech. VBC recalled the fact that Sir Charles Knowles led 40,000 British troops to slaughter 4,000 Abyssinians and that Chevoitot committed suicide, saying that Britain's prestige was shaken at that time, and tribal peoples imprisoned the British consul and failed to satisfy Britain quickly, so Britain had to punish Abyssinia. The Italian-Abyssinian conflict is similar. However, it is difficult to understand that the British people are in a panic at the news of Italy's plan. Regarding Eden's proposal to have the League of Nations handle this matter, the report states that the facts are very clear. Abyssinia is not qualified to join the League of Nations because of the slave trade and terrorism within the country. Italy's opposition to this move is exactly the same as Britain's opposition to arbitrating its colonies. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>

To safeguard the security of European countries, politicians in Geneva have proposed many solutions in successive international conferences, but all have been obstructed. From this point of view, the strengthening of the uneasy feeling is particularly evident. During Beneš's meetings with Litvinov, Stalin, and Molotov, they conducted careful examinations of the international situation in Europe from the perspective of the interests of peace. The representatives of both countries unanimously agreed that actively implementing a comprehensive organization of collective security on the basis of the indivisibility of peace is currently extremely important. The representatives of both countries further unanimously agreed that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact and the Czech-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, which are currently succeeding, are partial realizations of the aforementioned organization. They also reiterated that their respective governments have decided to work to remove obstacles to the larger organization of collective security, to strive to promote peace for the benefit of European countries, and to lay the foundation for cooperation between the two countries. Based on this mutual understanding and trust, Litvinov, Stalin, Molotov, and Beneš all expressed full satisfaction with the current state of mutual relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, the great achievements made by the friendship between the two countries in recent years, and the results of cooperation between the two countries aimed at promoting world peace. The representatives of both countries acknowledged that the conventions and agreements concluded by the two governments have laid a solid foundation for the continuation of cooperation between the two countries and the development of economic relations. They also paid close attention to the organized friendship between the scientific, literary, and artistic circles of the two countries and have decided to entrust the existing or future communication institutions of the two countries to be responsible for planning various necessary concrete measures to achieve the goal of the two countries pursuing the strengthening of intellectual cooperation between their peoples.

<h3>Kong Xiangrong Inspects River Defenses in Henan and Hebei</h3>
<p>To Inspect the Yellow River Estuary Soon</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Kong Xiangrong, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission's Water Conservancy Committee and Deputy Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, was recently dispatched by the Economic Commission to Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces to inspect river defenses along the Yellow River. It is learned that at 9:00 AM on the 6th of this month, Kong, accompanied by his secretary, special commissioner, and the Norwegian chief engineer of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, Anlisen, as well as personnel dispatched by the Henan River Affairs Bureau, departed from Kaifeng in three cars, crossed the river at Liuyuankou to Chenqiao, and traveled west along the river embankment in the afternoon, passing through Fengqiu territory. A section of the embankment was entirely sandy, and the wind blew sand, making construction extremely difficult. Then, they entered Wuzhi territory, traveled north along the east embankment of the Qin River. It was found that the Qin River originally originated from the Taihang Mountains in Shanxi, but this summer's severe drought has caused the entire river to dry up. That night, they stayed at the River Affairs Bureau in Wushe County. At 7:00 AM on the 7th, they turned into the east embankment of the Yellow River, which was diverted in the 22nd year, along the west embankment of the Qin River. Chen Ruzhen, Director of the Henan River Affairs Bureau, also accompanied them on this trip. Boulders were piled up along the embankment. According to Director Chen, these boulders were donated by the Pinghan Railway Bureau because the Railway Bureau recognized the importance of the project upstream of the Yellow River Railway Bridge and donated more than 10,000 cubic feet for flood prevention in advance, which was a benevolent act. This dangerous section of the river is mostly built with stone dams to block floods. From here, the north of the river has Qingyou, and the south has Guangwu Mountain, which can use natural forces to control the river. After the inspection, they returned to Wuzhi along the embankment. In the afternoon, they traveled south along the east embankment of the Qin River, visited the River God Temple, which was built with the remaining funds from river management that year, and then went to the north bank of the Yellow River Bridge, where they saw many stones thrown under the bridge piers, and the riverbed was heavily silted, only a few feet away from the tracks above the bridge. They then went east along the Rongze embankment, where the embankment surface was flat and planted with poplars and willows. After returning to the River Affairs Bureau, they also inspected various dangerous worksites in Zhengfan and Zhongmufan before returning to Bian via the Hei-gangkou Liuyuan dangerous work sites. By the time they arrived at the city wall, it was already 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that Kong will discuss post-disaster projects on the Henan section of the Yellow River with Henan Chairman Liu Zhi and river affairs authorities on the 8th. After inspecting the joint Taigui Huayang embankment and Jiugulutidi embankment on the 9th, he plans to change to a large red boat and travel east along the river to Jinan to discuss river affairs with the Shandong provincial authorities, and plans to go to the mouth of the Yellow River to inspect the Sanwunkou drainage problem at the mouth of the sea. It is estimated that he can return to Bian on the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Shandong Opens Small Mines on a Large Scale</h3>
<p>Thirteen Sites Officially Underway, Slope Shaft Measurement also Started, Difficult Labor Compensation Still Yields No Results</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The water robbery incident at the Rudak Mine has been going on for a month. Hundreds of workers are trapped in the water cave, and their bodies have not yet been recovered. The workers' families are crying to the heavens every day, which is the most tragic thing in the world. Regarding the issue of compensation, the company only agrees to give 302 yuan as compensation to each victim. The workers' families have repeatedly demanded more, but to no avail. Song Biru, Deputy Director of the Mining Affairs Office, and Director Zhang Shuheng went to Qingdao to ask the Rudak General Company for instructions. No telegram has yet arrived in Zibo. It is heard that Song and Zhang can return to Hongshan on the evening of the 9th. The Rudak Company will not stop opening small mines due to the opposition of the workers' families. On the 8th, all the small mines were started. In addition to the original six small mines in the North and South Shenmazhuang, four new small mines were opened in Chejiazhuang, and one small mine was added in each of the North and South Shenmazhuang, for a total of thirteen small mines. In addition, drainage engineering for inclined shafts is also underway. Kang Cun, the Measurement Director of Rudak, has been dispatched with staff members Li Dechun, Ten-Three, Wang Shizhen, and Sun Tanzhu to carry out the measurement. The location for the construction of the electric tramway has also been determined to be east of North Shenmazhuang, and a fourth layer of inclined shaft with a depth of 110 meters is being prepared to be opened, which will start soon. This project is contracted by Sun Changde and will take about four to five months at the earliest to complete. Currently, the water level in the Rudak mine is still rising rapidly, increasing by 17 millimeters per hour. It has now passed the third meter and a half of the fourth layer and is 107 and a half meters from the ground. Donations are still being remitted one after another. It is reported that Gao Qingtang, Standing Director of Rudak, has received 500 yuan, Ichikichi of Japan 1,000 yuan, Jin Yunpeng 1,000 yuan, and the Hua Wu Office 50 yuan, which will be distributed to the workers' families.

<h3>Songjiang, Zhu Xing Robbery Victim Examines Injuries</h3>
<p>Shen Yingu's home, a resident of Zhengliu Village, Zhujiaxing, Punan, was recently broken into by men speaking with a Qiyin accent, carrying guns and sticks. Shen Yingu, the victim, used to be a teacher and is currently bedridden due to illness. His son Xiancheng is a business partner, so the family is in decline. The thieves were misled by the rumor that the Shen family had property, so they tied up the father and son. Xiancheng's feet were injured. The clothes, fabrics, and ornaments in the house were all looted. Then, they went to the rooms of Shen Jinming, a member of the same clan, and Zhu Jicheng, a relative, to search. Although there was only a few dozen yuan in cash, the miscellaneous clothes, fabrics, jewelry, and beads used in each room were all taken away, worth about six or seven hundred yuan. When robbing Xiancheng's room, it was seen that one of the thieves was Jiangbei A-da, who used to run a twenty-one door gambling table in Zhujiaxing Town. After the incident, a list of losses was made and reported to the water and land police teams for investigation. The Zhu Shui police arrested Jiangbei A-da and sent him to the Zhujing Third Brigade for interrogation.

<h3>Suzhou, Demolition of Enclosure Fields De-escalates</h3>
<p>The dispute over the enclosure fields in Dongtai Lake has been reported in this newspaper.

Recently, the Ministry of Judicial Administration specially ordered the higher courts of various provinces to implement a three-level, three-trial system from July 1.

<h3>Cotton Textile Industry Decides to Reduce Working Hours</h3>
<p>Textile industrialists in Wuxi believe that due to the recent tense situation, tight credit, plummeting yarn prices, and complete lack of sales, yarn factories in places such as Tonghai and Jiangyin are suffering greatly and cannot maintain operations, and many have already implemented reduced working hours or temporarily suspended work. Wuxi is the most developed area for the inland textile industry. Although it has abundant resources, it is inevitably affected by the turbulent winds. Yesterday, the Cotton Textile Association convened a temporary meeting and discussed for a long time. Because the matter concerns the livelihood of laborers, it is necessary to consider both aspects. It was decided that each factory should independently consider the situation of its own factory and respond accordingly, according to the principle of reducing working hours by 30% to 50%.</p>
<h3>Changzhou, School Representatives Demand Overdue Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>The Education Bureau only raised and distributed one month of tuition fees for the schools in Wuyi for this semester. Schools in the city and countryside are struggling to survive in a very difficult situation. They are trying hard to support themselves, hoping that Education Bureau Director Qian Jinghu can raise and distribute one or two months before the Dragon Boat Festival to help them maintain operations. Unexpectedly, there was no news. The summer vacation is approaching, and everything must be concluded. There is no one to borrow from, and there is no solution. The schools have reached the end of their rope. The representatives of each school of the County School Joint Council had no choice but to go to the Education Bureau to ask Director Qian for instructions. Qian knew that he had no answer to this, so he expressed his resignation to thank his colleagues in the education field. On the 10th, he went to see County Magistrate Hou with the representatives of each school to explain the reasons for his resignation. County Magistrate Hou retained him at that time and promised to discuss it with the grain treasurer and try his best to find a way to ensure that the payment of education funds would be secured within one or two days. Then, schools in the city and countryside held a meeting to discuss that if the authorities still have no solution within these few days, they will convene an emergency general meeting to discuss the matter together.</p>
<h3>Chongming, Two More Stores Closed</h3>
<p>The stores in Chongming are also affected by the economic downturn. All industries are depressed. After the lunar Dragon Boat Festival, another foreign and general merchandise store closed. One is Liwanchang Foreign and General Merchandise Store in Beibao Town, which was opened in partnership for about five years. This spring, Dong Yushu started operating it alone. It suddenly closed on the 7th of this month. The other is Shunyu Xiang Foreign Goods Store in Jianhe Town, which opened in October last year with a capital of 3,000 yuan and was also established in partnership. Due to Wang Ruowu's mismanagement and sluggish business, it ceased operations on the 8th and announced liquidation.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang, Farmers' Association Telegrams Support Jingjiang Daily</h3>
<p>After the Jingjiang Daily was ordered to cease publication by Li Jinfang, acting magistrate of Jingjiang, and editor Liu Jianfan was convicted, Liu appealed to the Suzhou District Court.

Judge Zhu Qiao approved the supplementary summons and ruled to release Liu Jianfan on bail. The County Farmers' Association, representing the public, continued to appeal to higher authorities on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce and the Education Association for the newspaper to be published. The Qi telegram from the association is recorded below: To Yu, President of the Supervisory Yuan of the Central Party Department in Nanjing, Huang, Minister of the Interior, Chen, Chairman of the Provincial Party Department and Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, Yu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Work-Supervisory Envoy of Jiangsu, Zhang, Fourth District Party Affairs Instructor of Nantong, Zheng Junjian, Administrative Supervisory Commissioner. The Jingjiang Daily in this county has been published for seven years. Its arguments are fair and the public regards it as their mouthpiece. Now, due to the publication of a novel, it has been ordered to cease publication by the county government. The public hopes that the newspaper will be republished and requests the association to appeal on their behalf. This association, as the representative of the public, follows public opinion and respectfully submits this telegram for review and approval, allowing the newspaper to be republished. We will await your orders. Wang Xulun, Director of the Jiangsu Province Jingjiang County Farmers' Association, kowtows respectfully.</p>

When passing the school's newly built gymnasium, he entered and inspected it for a week, and then left the school at 2:00 PM and went straight to the Opium Addiction Treatment Center in Quekou Street to inspect it. He asked about the number of addicts in the center and the methods of detoxification. Chairman Chen personally visited the addicts' bedrooms, asking and persuading them.

<p>Emergency Meeting of the Bankers Association</p>
<p>The Bankers Association held its 68th emergency executive committee meeting at its Hong Kong Road hall at 2:00 PM yesterday.

(2) Regarding the Joint Reserve Committee's request to form a subcommittee to thoroughly study remittance transfers and other issues, it was resolved to approve it and jointly study with the Joint Reserve Committee.

<p>Financial Vice Minister Convenes Financial Meeting</p>

<p>Decision on Three Solutions</p>
<p>According to reliable sources obtained by the Xinsheng News Agency reporter, the meeting resulted in three solutions: (1) Remittance transfers will be concentrated in the Money Exchange Reserve Bank, with the Money Reserve Bank collecting collateral from various shops to guarantee this remittance transfer. (2) The Money Reserve Bank can exchange these collateralized assets for 1935 financial bonds from the Money Exchange Supervisory Committee. (3) The Money Reserve Bank can use these bonds to borrow cash from the banking syndicate. With the decision of these two solutions, the problem of remittance transfer circulation is completely resolved. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance's resolute proposal of 25 million yuan in financial bonds to exchange for collateral from the Money Exchanges to guarantee bank loans, ensuring that all parties are protected from losses, is indeed the best policy.</p>
<p>Acceptance by Foreign Merchants and Compradors Association</p>
<p>The Foreign Merchants and Compradors Association held a special meeting at the Jardine Matheson Bank on the Bund at 3:00 PM yesterday and resolved to accept the first of the five measures of the Money Exchanges, which states that "all foreign currency remittances from banks currently deposited in various shops must be transferred to the Money Reserve Bank simultaneously, and shops will no longer receive foreign currency remittances from banks." A reply was sent to the Money Exchanges Association, and the meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Money Reserve Bank's Membership in Exchange Approved</p>
<p>After the Money Exchange Joint Reserve Bank decided to join the Bankers Association's Joint Reserve Committee's check clearing house as an exchanger, the Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from relevant sources that the bank check clearing house has approved the Money Exchange Joint Reserve's membership. Manager Zhu Boquan of the check clearing house and Manager Qin Xiqing of the Money Exchange Reserve Bank began negotiating the procedures for joining yesterday. The check clearing house originally had 38 member banks, but after the Minghua Bank withdrew, it had 37. With the addition of the Money Exchange Reserve, it returns to 38. It is reported that it will take effect starting today.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Increases Members of Money Exchange Supervisory Committee</p>
<p>The members of the Money Exchange Supervisory Committee were originally Xu Kan, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, and Gu Yigu. According to the Xinsheng News Agency reporter, the Ministry of Finance has added Hu Meian, Shi Jiu'ao, Wang Zisong, and Xu Baoqi as members. The committee held a meeting at the Money Exchange Joint Reserve Bank at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, with all members attending. It is reported that the committee has accepted the fourth of the five measures of the Money Exchanges, which states that "[c]ollateralized loans made to the Central, China, and Communications Banks using deed pledges must be registered with the Ministry of Finance Supervisory Committee on the 11th of this month only. There will be no extensions. New deed pledges must also be registered on this day. All valuations will be calculated at 90% of the Bureau of Public Works' estimated value" and the fifth measure, which states that "[c]ollateralized loans made to the Central, China, and Communications Banks using government bonds will be valued at 100% of this month's market price. New loans will also follow this method. If the market price falls by 4 yuan, the difference must be paid."</p>
<p>Hope for Reduction in Remittance Transfer Fee</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from silver and money exchange sources yesterday that (1) "remittance transfer" refers to the loan currency of inter-industry accounting that must be collected in cash the next day, and (2) "remittance transfer fee" refers to foreign cash that must be paid in cash on the same day. Yesterday, the remittance transfer fee on the Money Exchange market was still at a peak of 7 jiao. Since the Ministry of Finance convened a financial meeting and decided on three solutions, those familiar with the matter observed that today's remittance transfer fee will definitely decrease.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Railway Company Loan Established</h3>

The Xinxin News Agency reporter has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Underwritten by Three Banks</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway Company has a fixed capital of 6 million yuan.

The bonds are divided into 3,000 shares, each with a face value of 1,000 yuan. The entire fixed assets listed in the company's balance sheet and property ledger as of the end of June 1935, totaling 6 million yuan, will serve as joint collateral for the bonds, giving it a strong credit rating. The China, Communications, and Shanghai Banks have agreed to underwrite the bonds, and subscriptions are very active.</p>
<p>Contract Signed</p>
<p>The company needs substantial funds to complete various projects. After discussions between General Manager Zhang Jingjiang and banking circles, it was decided to collateralize the company's bonds with a face value of 2 million yuan at an 80% discount to borrow 1.6 million yuan in cash from the China, Communications, and Shanghai Banks.

<h3>Gu Xinyi Discusses Gradually Reducing Purchases of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Merchants Have No Reason to Want to Purchase Foreign Rice; Domestic Production Should Be Increased Year by Year</p>
<p>Although China claims to be an agricultural country, the number of foreign rice imports in recent years has been truly alarming. Both the government and the public are thinking of ways to remedy this. Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, plans to gradually reduce the purchase of foreign rice by rice merchants, limiting it to one-tenth each year. The Central News Agency reporter asked Gu Xinyi, a prominent figure in the food industry, about this matter. His response is as follows:</p>
<p>Domestic Production Should Be Increased</p>
<p>According to Gu, the sharp increase in foreign rice imports in recent years is due to the expansion of areas affected by natural disasters in China, which has greatly reduced harvests. It is necessary to purchase foreign rice to supplement the supply. This is certainly not what the Chinese people want. Now, the authorities should passively increase the tax on foreign rice and actively make farmers' lives more stable and improve production techniques. Then, domestic grain production will increase, and foreign rice can be eliminated. Therefore, as long as domestic rice production is sufficient to maintain the people's food supply, merchants will have no reason to purchase foreign rice again. If the purchase is to be reduced year by year, it should be done by increasing domestic production year by year.</p>
<p>No Siamese Rice Imports</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter asked Gu whether rice merchants could stop purchasing Siamese rice because the Siamese authorities are mistreating Chinese residents in Siam. Gu replied that although Siam is a rice-producing country, its rice is not suitable for sale in China. In fact, there are no Siamese rice imports.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Agricultural and Forestry Bureau Director, Feng Rui, Flew Back to Guangdong Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Feng Rui, Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Guangdong Provincial Government, came to Shanghai on official business and went to Beiping to inspect the alcohol industry.

<h3>Zhu Jingzhou Traveled to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Will Take Eurasia Plane Back to Gansu Today; All National Taxes in Gansu Have Been Returned to the Central Government</p>
<p>Zhu Jingzhou, Director of the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance, came to Shanghai from Beijing some time ago to negotiate a loan and has now completed his work. He took the night express train to Beijing last night and will transfer to the Eurasia plane back to Gansu. The reporter visited Zhu at his residence yesterday afternoon. Zhu had just recovered from a fever and his spirit had not fully recovered. The interview is recorded as follows: (Q) (Reporter's question) I recently heard that Gansu has returned all kinds of national tax revenues to the central government. What is the situation? (A) (Zhu's reply) Following Chairman Zhu's instructions, I have long wanted the central government to directly collect taxes that are national in nature to comply with government orders. In addition to the stamp tax, which has long been handled in accordance with the ministry's orders, we have now eliminated the special tobacco tax collected in Gansu from July 1, which has been approved by Director Kong of the Tax Bureau and formally notified to the Gansu Provincial Government. (Q) I heard that the salt tax has also been changed to be directly collected by the central government. Is that true? (A) The salt tax is not directly under the jurisdiction of the Department of Finance, so I don't know the details. However, Chairman Zhu did ask the Ministry of Finance to take over with the utmost sincerity. It is reported that Director Kong has already agreed. In short, all matters discussed between the Ministry of Finance and the Gansu Provincial Government this time were approached with the utmost sincerity, washing away the bad habits of haggling of former officials, which is indeed a good phenomenon between the central government and the local government. (Q) Is there a set date for returning to Gansu? (A) Because Chairman Zhu has repeatedly urged by telegram, the Eurasia plane has been scheduled to fly directly back to Gansu on the 12th. (Q) I heard that Chairman Zhu plans to invite leaders from Shanghai's financial and industrial circles to Gansu for inspection. Has this been decided yet? (A) Many people in Shanghai's financial circles are old acquaintances. I have been ordered to extend the invitation, and many are willing to go. However, due to the current financial turmoil, all circles feel uneasy, so the departure date may have to be postponed. (Q) What is the climate like in Gansu? (A) Based on my experience in the past two years, the climate in Gansu is truly warm in winter and cool in summer. Its good climate is unmatched in the country and is beyond what most people expect. People in China who have not been to Gansu often think that it is a cold and desolate place beyond the borders, which is very absurd.</p>
<h3>Zheng Tianxi Set Sail Yesterday Afternoon to Attend Two International Criminal Meetings</h3>
<p>Zheng Tianxi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, was ordered by the central government to represent China at the International Criminal Law Conference to be held in Berlin, Germany in early August, and the International Uniform Criminal Law Conference to be held in Denmark in September. At the same time, Zheng is also serving as a commissioner to participate in the Chinese Art Exhibition in London. Therefore, he has brought forward his departure from the country so that he can prepare for the art exhibition in England earlier. Zheng came to Shanghai from Beijing some days ago and took care of everything. At 2:00 PM yesterday, he boarded the Rajputana mail ship of the British company at the New Customs Wharf and set sail. Many of Zheng's relatives and friends went to the wharf to see him off.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Banking Circles Believe Worldwide Adoption of the Gold Standard is Impossible</h3>
<p>According to a Havas Washington dispatch, the International Chamber of Commerce Federation will discuss the adoption of the gold standard worldwide to achieve currency stability at its general meeting to be held in Paris on the 24th of this month. Yesterday morning, the Central News Agency reporter asked a banker in Shanghai about his opinion on this matter. He said that at a time when the world's finances are extremely panic-stricken, countries that have adopted the gold standard are abolishing it. Therefore, he believes that it is impossible to achieve currency stability by advocating the adoption of the gold standard worldwide. Moreover, the United States' silver policy is actively advancing, which puts this move in direct opposition to the United States. Furthermore, the financial policies adopted by other countries are mostly contrary to it, so this proposal may soon disappear.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Six Companies; Alliance Cooperates to Share Expenses for One Year</h3>
<p>The sharing of water freight by the alliance of the Six Yangtze River Companies has been discussed by representatives of the six companies for more than half a year. The various measures have now been agreed upon and unanimously approved. The implementation period will be from July 1, with a trial period of one year (the previous report of half a year was incorrect) to June 30 next year. However, within this one year, the six companies may not withdraw from the alliance agreement without reason. Even by next year, if they do not want to continue, they must notify in advance three months before the expiration date so that a public decision can be made. If it is unanimously deemed beneficial, it can still be continued after the one-year term expires and the contract will be considered valid. With July 1 approaching, the representatives of the wheel companies convened another meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the procedures to be handled after implementation.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's City Party Headquarters Convenes Meeting with Teachers of Literacy Schools</h3>
<p>Seeking to Finalize School Locations and Commence Enrollment; All Schools Officially Established Before the 20th</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, at 2 p.m. yesterday, the Literacy Education Promotion Association of the City Party Headquarters specially convened a meeting with teachers of literacy schools who had formally registered and been accepted by the headquarters. In attendance were the association's managing director, Tong Xingbai, and association staff members Mao Yun, Huang Tiren, Zhang Sheng, Gu Shaoyan, Wang Longzhang, Lu Yinchu, Yu Zhenhui, Peng Yongjie, and others, as well as 48 teachers. Tong Xingbai presided over the meeting, Huang Tiren served as recorder, and Lu Yinchu served as master of ceremonies. After the customary rituals, the chairman outlined the steps for promoting the literacy movement in the city and reported on the implementation methods and points that teachers should pay attention to when preparing. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Instructions: Roughly stated, today the City Party Headquarters has called everyone together for a discussion with a few intentions to share. This time, the city is organizing literacy education. This literacy movement is originally one of the seven movements. It has been done in the past, but because there was no collective effort, the results were poor. To handle this kind of major work, the joint effort of all groups in the city is necessary to achieve satisfactory results. This time, it is not only the Party and government that are organizing, but also all groups are united in doing so. The City Party Headquarters is the leader of all groups, so this Party Headquarters is leading 400 to 500 groups in the city to organize. With the power of 400 to 500 groups, we will definitely be able to completely eliminate illiteracy in the shortest possible time. However, many groups, due to location or talent constraints, have specifically entrusted us to handle it on their behalf. Groups are contributing financially. Currently, there are already 300 to 400 self-organized ones, and 50 to 60 that are being handled on behalf of others. However, the difficulty in organizing literacy education now, its success or failure, does not lie in the number of groups or the financial capacity. The key lies entirely in the talent and effort of the teachers. The first difficulty is recruiting students, because it is not easy for teachers to go and find students. The key is to make students always feel like they want to study and have the magic to arouse their interest in reading, which can be seen at graduation. Therefore, the teacher's responsibility is very important. If you only teach a thousand words or six hundred words, a primary school graduate is enough. Why is it necessary to have middle school or university graduates? The reason why we want to select strictly is that it is not just about teaching a few words. Therefore, we must be hard-working and patient, and have experience and be willing to take responsibility. You are all selected by the City Party Headquarters, and there are a few points you must remember: (1) You must fulfill your responsibility, do not perfunctorily handle things. You must understand that you must not disappoint the people. The City Party Headquarters is responsible to the people's groups, and you are responsible to the City Party Headquarters. If you cannot take responsibility, you can explain it first, do not delay the public, and become a public criminal. Do not think that being a literacy teacher is a small matter, have confidence, and do things well. Then we will not only benefit ourselves, but also benefit the country, society, and mankind, and our own spirit will be even more comforted. Our method of saving the country is to save the country from our own position, and everyone should fulfill their own responsibility. (2) You must have a spirit of service, and respond to the needs of the people you are teaching, such as the porter teams, etc. First, you must have a strong sense of empathy. Do not think of yourself as an educator, appearing dignified and putting on a teacher's airs. Second, life must be hard. Do not think that you can live a life of luxury. Third, you must have a missionary spirit. Only then will you be qualified as a literacy teacher.</p>
<p>Report: (1) You must recruit students and find school locations yourself. Regardless of whether you hope for Type A (70 or more people), Type B (50 or more people), or Type C (30 or more people), recruitment is entirely up to you. The scale and results depend on your own efforts. The number of people in the morning and afternoon classes can be calculated on average. (3) Not only teach literacy, but also teach knowledge and guide civic training, that is, supplement teaching when teaching characters. (4) Teacher's salary (A) calculated from the opening day of the school, (B) Type A salary 30 yuan, miscellaneous expenses 5 yuan (if miscellaneous expenses are not needed, this 5 yuan will be added to the teacher's salary), Type B salary 25 yuan, Type C 20 yuan (Type B and C miscellaneous expenses are the same as Type A), the remaining money is used to purchase paper and pens for students (estimated at 10 cents per student). At the end, if there is a shortage, the three types will be combined for calculation. If there is a surplus, prizes will be prepared.</p>
<p>(Preparation) (1) Before June 20, officially establish separately. From tomorrow (the 12th) to the 18th, complete preparations, and separately recruit locations and students. As long as it is within the scope of Shanghai, no matter where, it is roughly divided into (A) finding a region, (B) finding a house, and (C) recruiting students. (2) In advance, the City Party Headquarters has found permitted houses, etc. After the meeting, you can contact the staff of this association, it was said. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Mei Feng Liquidation Progress Report</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that today (the 11th), it was learned from He Fu, the liquidator of the Mei Feng Bank, that the auditor, De Fute, and his assistants have been auditing the bank's accounts for several days, up to the date the bank suspended operations on May 24. It is expected that the bank's actual position will be announced to the public this Friday. Bu Wen will strive for simplicity and clarity so that depositors can understand it at a glance. For days, the liquidator has been vigorously pursuing outstanding payments from various customers to prepare for the repayment of deposits. Many customers are willing to offset debts with goods.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Instructs All Consolidated Tax Bureaus and Offices; Gansu Province Cigarette Secretly Handles Consolidated Tax</h3>
<p>To be Implemented from July 1</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has decided that the consolidated tax on cigarettes in Gansu Province will be changed to be handled by the central government from July 1. Yesterday, it specially instructed all consolidated tax bureaus and offices, roughly stating that the preparatory work for the consolidated tax on cigarettes in Gansu Province has been temporarily approved by this department for trial implementation. It is planned that from the 24th year, the central government will allocate supplementary funds to subsidize local education and various legitimate purposes. From July 1 of this year, all cigarettes in Gansu Province will be subject to consolidated tax. All cigarettes leaving the factory in provinces implementing consolidated tax and transported to Gansu Province shall pay consolidated tax, affix sufficient stamps, and obtain a consolidated tax transportation permit before being allowed to be transported. After the cigarettes arrive in Gansu Province, no additional taxes or levies shall be imposed to comply with tax policy. After the consolidated tax is implemented this time, cigarettes originally stored in Shaanxi Province that applied to be transported to Gansu Province because the cigarettes transported to Gansu Province took the route through Shaanxi Province, resulting in the collection of transit taxes, shall not apply to the ministry for tax refunds to seek advantage, etc.</p>
<h3>Aviation Association Headquarters Issues Direct Membership Certificates to Various Places; Sand and Gravel Industry to Discuss Levying Aviation Patriotic Donation Today</h3>
<p>For the purpose of extensively soliciting donations, the Shanghai Solicitation Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association, in addition to expanding the solicitation through the team leaders and deputy team leaders, specially held a public announcement in the newspaper to directly solicit members. Since the beginning, people from provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, Anhui, and various cities and counties have requested to join as members and have requested the articles of association and solicitation documents to introduce them as much as possible, which shows the enthusiasm of the people in various places for supporting the aviation patriotic movement. The industry, commerce, and academic circles in this city have also joined enthusiastically. The General Team Office has separately compiled and sent the membership certificates according to type and number and asked them to work hard to introduce more members to form a great cause, it was said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the General Team Office continued to receive 200 yuan in membership fees submitted by Wu Zisheng, team leader of the 60th team, and 175.98 yuan in membership fees and donations submitted by Wang Jinglu, team leader of the 326th team. They were all accepted, and receipts were issued to thank them and ask them to continue their efforts, it was said.</p>
<p>Various industries in this city are very enthusiastic in supporting the aviation patriotic movement. It is reported that the Sand and Gravel Industry Association will convene a meeting of various industries at 2 p.m. today to discuss all matters related to the collection of aviation patriotic donations, it was said.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Company's New Ship, the Wulin, Receives Visitors from All Walks of Life; Maiden Voyage to Hankou and Changsha This Morning</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company has added the new Wulin ship to its Shanghai-Hunan shipping line, which is a regular service. The ship was built at its own factory in Hong Kong and will serve Shanghai, Hunan, and various ports along the Yangtze River. The ship is the newest and fastest of the river steamers. The company specially invited visitors from all walks of life yesterday. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Beautiful Hull: The ship is 260 feet long, 50 feet wide, and has a draft of 9 feet 6 inches. Its speed is approximately 12 nautical miles per hour or more. The machinery was custom-made by a famous Swiss factory. The hull was decorated at the company's own factory in Hong Kong. There are a total of 20 dining rooms, with half of them being single rooms and half of them being double rooms. The first-class cabin can accommodate 22 people, and the steerage can accommodate 80 people. The decoration of each part is magnificent, the air circulation is good, and water coolers and electric fans are provided, making it warm in winter and cool in summer. The deck is spacious, allowing passengers to take a walk. Other advantages are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Reception and Visit: The ship was docked at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund yesterday. From 4 to 6 p.m., visitors from all walks of life and customs brokers were invited to visit. More than 100 people attended, including Gao Enhong, Guo Shun, Pan Ziquan, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lüdeng, Ma Changsheng, Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Tiezhang, and others. Tea and snacks were served. The company's Chinese general manager, Yang Meinan, Chinese manager, Yang Shaonan, and staff members Zhang Zhipan, Zhang Dongge, and Liang Jintang hosted the event, which was quite a success. The ship sailed to Hankou and Changsha this morning.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Request Restoration of Stamp Duty Review Committee</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating that after the Ministry of Finance's legal institutions依法审罚依法审罚 and implemented it for several months, merchants have felt quite obstructed: (1) The court already handles many cases on a regular basis, and now that it has to handle stamp duty violation cases, it is inevitable that it will be overwhelmed. According to merchants, it takes two to three months to complete a case. When the case is not completed, the seized account books cannot be returned according to regulations. However, the relationship between account books and business is also delayed day by day, which is the most inconvenient thing for merchants. (2) The court has few precedents for the Ministry's orders and decisions on stamp duty matters, and it is inevitable that there will be discrepancies in handling unfamiliar cases. Although the ruling can still be appealed, the court's three-level, three-trial system will soon be implemented. Now that stamp duty cases are handled by the primary trial, they will be handled by the local trial court in the future. For cases ruled by the Shanghai Local Court, it will be necessary to appeal to the Suzhou Higher Court in the future, so the cost of litigation for a case with a fine of ten yuan will be several times higher, which is extremely inconvenient. Therefore, due to these two difficulties, it is generally believed that stamp duty cases are originally administrative penalties. Except for the concessions, which can only maintain the current system due to special circumstances, it is more appropriate to restore the former Stamp Duty Review Committee in other inland areas. Since the association has the responsibility to convey commercial information, it does not dare to withhold it from the higher authorities. It is reasonable to cable and request the Ministry to review and approve the implementation for public convenience. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marines Continued to Practice Street Fighting Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Shiye News Agency reports that the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai continued to conduct street fighting exercises in the area of the Bazidi Field at the end of North Sichuan Road, Jiangwan Road, the end of Baoshan Road, and the border of the concession from about 7 a.m. yesterday morning, and only withdrew to their teams after three hours.</p>
<h3>Northwest Society Merges with Northwest Problem Research</h3>
<p>The Northwest Problem Research Association recently received a letter from the Northwest Society requesting a merger. The executive committee convened a meeting at the Shanghai Bank Building on Jiangxi Road, in the association's conference hall, to discuss the matter. The Northwest Society is composed of more than 150 young people from Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and other provinces, as well as from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, including Wang Fengyi, Ren Guanjun, Ma Sanji, Kang Wenzhi, Yang Zuorong, and others. In the past, it published several issues of the New Northwest Monthly, which contained detailed records of the situation in the Northwest. Later, because the person in charge of the association either returned home to serve or went abroad to study, the association's affairs were suspended. Recently, Wang Fengyi and others, the persons in charge of the association, sent a letter to the Northwest Problem Research Association requesting a merger. It is learned that the Northwest Problem Research Association discussed the matter and decided on three methods: (1) Welcome all 150 members of the Northwest Society to become members of the association. (2) The Northwest Society will be responsible for concluding all previous affairs and unfinished matters of the association. (3) Both parties will send letters to all members of the Northwest Society asking them to re-register with the Northwest Problem Research Association for communication and contact, etc.</p>
<h3>Report on the Income of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society</h3>
<p>The Current Situation of Disaster Relief and Famine in Liyang</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Society on Renji Road has successively completed the spring relief work in various districts of Jiangsu Province that have been severely affected by the drought. However, the disaster area in Liyang is vast and the disaster situation is even more serious. It is working with the Jisheng Society, so it is still investigating and providing relief. The report of the commissioner sent by the society is copied as follows: Liyang has always been known as a wealthy area, but it has been repeatedly affected by famine and military disasters. The financial sector has long been severely damaged. In addition, there was a severe drought last year. All the mountain and embankment fields in the county, totaling more than 1 million mu, were completely cracked after the summer, and the rivers were completely cracked. Districts 12364 of the county have been surveyed as soon as possible. Among them, the disaster situation in Districts 3 and 6 is the most serious. The reason is that the terrain is high and there are many mountains. It was dry before the drought and barren before the barrenness, so it is especially severe compared to other districts. The terrain in Districts 1 and 2 is slightly flatter, and people's livelihoods are slightly more active, but the disaster situation is the same. When investigating in various villages, I personally saw that the general disaster victims were thin and haggard, and dying people were everywhere. When entering their villages, no chickens or dogs could be heard. When entering their rooms, there was nothing. The misery is beyond description. Many people died from digging and eating Guanyin flour (tender stone), which caused abdominal pain, difficulty in defecation, and constipation. Many people also ate grass roots and bark. Because District 6 was more severely affected, it was investigated first. On May 28 and 29, relief rice was distributed at the Baoen Temple in the county seat. A total of 1,472 tickets for 2 dou of rice, 3,577 tickets for 3 dou of rice, and 1,413 tickets for 4 dou of rice were collected, and a total of 1,932 dan and 7 dou of relief rice were distributed. When distributing relief, the county magistrate was invited to supervise the distribution in the name of this association and the Jisheng Society, and party, government, military, and police personnel attended the event to assist. Xu from the Wuxi Catholic Church also came to Liyang to help. Districts 2 and 3 have also been surveyed successively. District 2 is divided into 22 villages. A total of 9,662 households have been issued relief tickets. The code words on the relief tickets are the five characters "Hui Jian Miao Zheng Guo." The distribution is being planned in a unified manner. Now that it is the season of Mangzhong, the wheat harvest is approaching. Although the farmers have a slight celebration of the harvest, they must plant rice seedlings immediately. It is heard that many people lack rice seeds. About one-quarter of the white fields in each village can be seen. The planted seedlings are gradually withering due to the hot weather and lack of ponds and rivers, which makes irrigation difficult. If there is no rain for a week, the planted seedlings will inevitably wither.</p>
<h3>Family Members of Sailors on the Lexington Ship Petitioned Various Agencies Yesterday</h3>
<p>Personally Submitting a Petition Stating the Guarantee Process and Requesting Justice and a Thorough Investigation of False Accusations</p>
<p>Regarding the unclear death of sailor He Baosheng, who served on the Lexington ship, the deceased's wife, He Zhuxingyu, personally requested relief from the union. In addition, four sailors from the Lexington ship, Tu Decai, etc., were investigated by the union without any suspicious points being found. Furthermore, the Yanying General Agency and other maritime groups, as well as another real commercial firm, provided a guarantee, requesting that they be allowed to temporarily serve on the ship and await investigation. However, after Tu and others returned to the ship, it was mistakenly heard that they were bailed out by union staff, and that Tu and others were temporarily returning to work on the ship meant that they were going to escape. It was not understood that the detectives at the time were only conducting inquiries and were not arresting them. Therefore, the union was able to move to the union for inquiries. After the inquiry, no suspicious points were found, and the guarantee was allowed based on the efforts of the group. They were allowed to temporarily return to the ship and await investigation. Now it is learned that the wives and all the sailors of the ship, as well as their families in Shanghai, have for days heard that someone is making false accusations and creating rumors, which is obviously malicious. Outraged, they specially requested the Yanying General Agency and other maritime groups to lead them to petition the party, government, and military agencies in the city yesterday, personally submitting a petition proving that Tu Decai and others were indeed falsely accused and that there were obviously villains at work, requesting a thorough investigation to clarify the injustice and maintain justice. The details and petition are recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition Situation: Yesterday, there were a total of more than 400 family members of sailors on the Lexington ship, men and women mixed, young and old, in a very miserable situation. At 8 a.m., led by the Yanying General Agency and other maritime groups, they took seven large trucks to the City Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Security Department, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Maritime Union, the Maritime Party and Township Association, and other places to petition. They were all received by the main personnel, who expressed sympathy for the points of the petition, and promised to thoroughly investigate and uphold justice in addition to comfort, it was said.</p>
<p>Petition: We are here to report that someone is intending to extort money and make false accusations. Please investigate thoroughly to clarify the injustice and maintain justice. The circumstances of the unclear death of sailor He Baosheng on the Lexington ship are unclear. The wives of Tu Decai, Jiang Fucai, Chen Yuebei, and Le A'er were interrogated and detained for two days by the Public Security Avoidance Detective Team on the day the ship arrived in port. They were not informed of the reason. The ship was about to sail, and Tu and Jiang were the leaders of the firemen and watermen. If they missed the ship because of this, not only would Tu and Jiang's livelihood be cut off, but all the workers on the ship would lose their jobs. The wives were extremely panic-stricken and begged the Yanying General Agency and other five maritime groups to petition the Maritime Union for relief. The Maritime Union sent personnel to negotiate with the Public Security Bureau, which stated that it was an inquiry and not an arrest. Therefore, the Maritime Union held a letter and moved the inquiry to the union. After strict questioning by the union, it was determined that Tu and others had no suspicious points. Therefore, the Yanying General Agency and other five maritime groups and the Shanghai National Trading Company guaranteed that they would return to the ship, temporarily work, and await investigation. The officials of the Shaoxing Native Place Association had other intentions and did not achieve their wishes. After Tu and others returned to the ship, they made a big fuss, with sinister intentions, determined to achieve their wish to frame them. The staff of the Shaoxing Native Place Association went to the Maritime Union to request relief after Tu and others returned to the ship. The union explained the case and comforted them. Later, they also expressed gratitude and left, and presented a petition to the union for relief the next day. After a few days, the Shaoxing Native Place Association falsely claimed that Tu and other four people were suspects, creating rumors and lending this as an excuse to arrange for others to take their positions, so that they could profit from it. The two accounts were contradictory, as if it were a child's play, confusing the audience, and the situation was obviously bad. Tu and other four people were usually careful and prudent and had never committed any wrongdoing. The whole ship praised them. They were unjustly wronged. Fortunately, the union was discerning and knew that they were innocent, and also considered their livelihoods and allowed them to temporarily be released on bail to return to work on the ship and await investigation. The families were able to rely on them for their livelihood and avoid displacement. They were grateful for the bright virtue and were all willing to die for it. They were deeply disappointed by the various slanders of the staff of the Shaoxing Native Place Association (omitted below).</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Place Association Hopes That the Temporary Tax on the Fishing Industry on Shengsi Island Will Be Abolished</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai stated that the residents of the Chongming County Fifth District Shengsi Islands are all from Zhejiang and engaged in the fishing industry. The county's business tax bureau recently set up offices on the Shengsi Islands to levy a temporary business tax on the fishing industry. The association believes that Shengsi is a fish-producing area. All the fish caught must be transported to other ports for sale and must bear business tax. It is inevitable that levying taxes at the place of origin is a superimposed structure. It has separately telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Ministry of Finance to express its opinions. Now that the case is unresolved, it has sent a special letter to the Fifth District Office of Chongming County asking it to advocate for unity. The letter states: "Respected Sir, the Chongming County Business Tax Bureau has levied a temporary business tax on the fishing industry on the Shengsi Islands under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District, with a tax rate of 0.5% for both fishermen and fish merchants. It is heard that items such as fish salt, fishing gear, and baked hemp are also subject to taxation. Shengsi Islands are fish-producing areas. The result of fishing by fishermen (such as fishing boats, etc.) and fish merchants' activities (such as ice boats, etc.) must be transported to Shanghai, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and ports along the Yangtze River for sale. At that time, the local business tax bureau will naturally levy taxes. Now, if a temporary business tax is levied at the place of origin, it seems that it is inevitable that it is a superimposed tax. This year, the price of fish has plummeted, and fishermen and fish merchants are all on the verge of bankruptcy. Imposing a heavy tax on them will put the fishing industry in a state of irretrievable disaster. Our association is currently submitting separate requests to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to prevent this. Your district office is stationed there and must have heard of the difficult situation. Therefore, we are writing to ask you to advocate for unity in order to maintain a lifeline for the fishing industry."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Conference of the Christian Faith and Action Salvation Corps; First Use Written Advice for Suicide Cases</h3>
<p>The China Christian Faith and Action Salvation Corps, based on the Christian gospel and its spirit of universal love, sacrifice, and saving the world, aims to assist the church in promoting the truth and to awaken the Chinese people to engage in reforming hearts, saving people, and saving the country. It has established a general headquarters in the capital. After the establishment of the Shanghai Regional Corps, the number of members reached more than 380.

Xie Songsan, Ma Shuguan, Hong Kunshan, Zhu Haoran, Zhou Meicun, etc. were in the minority of five. Yesterday afternoon, the third first executive committee meeting was held at the office at No. 316 Xizang Road. Mr. Yu Zhizhai was appointed as the temporary chairman. After the ceremony, the staff reported on the progress of the regional corps and the process of hosting the National Congress of Representatives in Shanghai. Zhao Jinqing was elected as the chairman, and Mr. Zhu Guishen and Mr. You Shuxun were elected as the vice chairmen. Li Denghui was elected as the economic committee member, and Yu Zhizhai was elected as the document committee member. Next, the committee discussed the resignation requests of the four executive committee members and decided to express sincere retention. In addition to urging them in writing, they also asked the attendees to persuade them separately. Zhao Jinqing proposed that suicide cases in Shanghai are increasing day by day, and even the whole family is destroyed, which is unbearable to hear. The corps is based on the principle of saving people and should take measures to eliminate it. It is proposed to first use written advice and should be publicly decided, which was unanimously approved. You Shuxun was designated as the drafter and was given a time limit to publish it soon. Then, they had lunch and dispersed.</p>
<h3>The Association for Child Welfare is Planning to Build a Clubhouse; The Location is in the Jiangwan City Center Area</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Association for Child Welfare originally leased the remaining tail of the National Association of the YMCA on Museum Road as its clubhouse. Now, because the buildings there are narrow and overflowing, it is planned to purchase land in the Jiangwan city center area to build a six-story building. Chen Tiesheng, Zhang Yueru, Chen Zhengfan, and others have been appointed to be responsible for the design. Once the design is completed, it will be submitted to the executive committee for review and implementation. After the building is completed, all affiliated institutions, such as the Child Welfare Daycare Center, the Child Welfare Training Institute, the Child Welfare Clinic, the Modern Parents Monthly Magazine, the Modern Parents Library, the Modern Parents Research Room, the Modern Parents Auditorium, the Modern Parents Conference Room, and the Modern Parents Club, will be moved in together to facilitate work.</p>
<h3>Longhua Temple Restoration: The Imperial Edition of the Great Buddhist Canon of the Wanli Era of the Ming Dynasty</h3>
<p>Preliminary Sorting Reveals Losses; Temple Resolves to Copy and Supplement to Complete the Volume</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the ancient Longhua Temple in this city, built during the Three Wu Dynasties, houses in its Sutra Repository a complete imperial edition of the Great Buddhist Canon from the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. The temple's abbot, Xing Kong, considering this canon to be of great importance to Chinese literature, and not to be treated lightly, decided to restore it. However, preliminary examination revealed that it had been partially lost. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Brief Account of the Sutra Repository</p>
<p>The complete Great Buddhist Canon is arranged with thirteen volumes per case, excluding the table of contents, totaling 730 cases. This time, the temple's abbot, Xing Kong, invited Master Mantu to conduct a preliminary sorting. Upon inspection, 355 cases were found to be complete and undamaged, 319 cases were partially damaged, and 53 cases were completely lost.</p>
<p>Regrettable Losses</p>
<p>The case numbers of the completely lost sections are: Xuan, Sheng, Kun, Nai, Qian, Diao, Tang, Chui, Ping, Zhang, Ju, Shi, Wu, Nv, Liang, Si, Jing, Ke, Zheng, Fei Yue, Liu, Shi, Shan, Bie, Feng, You, Yi, Mi, Nei, Jie, Bing, Chi, Ce, Ying, Kuang, You, Duo, Meng, Jian, Heng, Ting, Jia, Bao, Yi, Jue, Jia, You, Mian, Tai, Jiao, She, totaling 53 cases.</p>
<p>Destroyed by Cixi</p>
<p>Master Mantu, who was invited to undertake the restoration of the canon at Longhua Temple, has extensive experience in sutra sorting. In 1930, when Chongqing Huayan Temple requested a copy of the Great Buddhist Canon from Beiping, Master Mantu was responsible for proofreading it. That canon was also a Ming edition, but regrettably, five cases, Yi, Jue, Jia, You, and Mian, were destroyed by Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty, also not being a complete set.</p>
<p>Copying and Supplementation Planned</p>
<p>Abbot Xing Kong of Longhua Temple plans to copy and supplement the lost and damaged sections after the entire canon has been sorted, in order to create a complete volume. However, the work is extensive and will require Master Mantu to oversee the entire process to preserve the literature.</p>
<h3>Please Eliminate Public Defecation Areas</h3>
<p>There is a garbage dump at the rear of No. 3 San Guantang Road, just off of South Shanghai's Lujiabang Road. Additionally, to the east end of San Guantang and the east end of Liyuan Road's Dabu Assembly Hall there is an area used to defecate and urinate at will. As the weather has grown progressively hotter since summer started, these areas have been exposed to intense sunlight, causing noxious odors to spread all around, greatly impacting the sanitation of the residents living nearby. It is reported that Yang Junpu, Xu Zuoxun, and others have submitted a formal request to the Public Health Bureau.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Should Not Abuse Advertisements</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association sent a letter yesterday to members who had published advertisements in the Da Ri Bao newspaper. It reads, "We write to inform you that, to rectify discipline, we notified all members on October 29th of last year that, regarding newspaper advertisements, aside from representing clients, announcing the relocation of offices, changes in telephone numbers, or commencing practice, and celebratory messages, one should not independently publish advertisements resembling the solicitation of lawsuits, or merely list names, offices, and telephone numbers. Recently, however, it has come to our attention that the names and telephone numbers of your members have continued to appear in advertisements in the Da Ri Bao, raising suspicions of violating resolutions and disrupting discipline. The 197th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Association has resolved to send a letter instructing the cessation of such advertisements. We hereby notify you to investigate and promptly cease publishing such advertisements to avoid misunderstandings."</p>
<h3>Thirty Literacy Schools Added in Zhabei Datong District</h3>
<p>To promote universal literacy education, the Municipal Party Headquarters, after issuing a notice to all social organizations in the city to establish literacy schools, has seen various parties begin to make preparations and enroll students in succession. The Datong District Literacy Education Office, considering that the Zhabei district has more coolies than other areas, originally planned to establish ten schools, but found it difficult to accommodate everyone. Therefore, it was decided at yesterday morning's meeting to increase the number to thirty schools. Each district branch should prepare as many schools as possible, aiming for three schools per branch. The eight district party headquarters will instruct the branches to prepare.</p>
<h3>Fire Burns Five Houses in Sipailou Within the City</h3>
<p>Yang Henglong Robe and Costume Shop, No. 43 Sipailou Road, inside the East Gate, is owned by Yang Jianqing from Suzhou. Yang's family lives upstairs. For over twenty years, they have employed Ye Songru from Zhenjiang as an accountant, Xia Qingyun, and others as staff, along with seven apprentices. The business is doing well. The shop next door, No. 41, Xintai Xiang Shroud Shop, is owned by Gu Zhiren from Haiyan, and has been there for three years. The two shops share a two-story rear building. Unexpectedly, at 2:50 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the firewood room in the rear building. The fire quickly spread through the rice straw and became uncontrollable. Pan Ruan, a Zhenjiang worker sleeping in the Yang Henglong parlor, discovered the fire and shouted a warning. Everyone was startled awake and immediately reported it to Zhu Zidan, the police officer at Post No. 10 of the Yimiao Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who used the telephone to notify various fire brigades to dispatch fire engines to the scene quickly. However, the fire was raging fiercely and had already broken through the roof. After the firefighters worked tirelessly to extinguish the flames, the fire was finally brought under control after about two hours. Five houses were destroyed, and the loss of goods was considerable. The police station dispatched several officers to maintain order and investigate the cause of the fire, taking Yang Jianqing and Gu Zhiren to the station for questioning. It is reported that Yang Henglong did not have fire insurance, while Xintai Xiang had fire insurance for 3,000 yuan with Huaxing Insurance.</p>
<h3>Songban Boat Capsizes, Two Drown</h3>
<p>A small Chang Lun Company boat was towing a Songban boat the other day. At 1:45 PM, when passing Yangsi Port, a strong wind and raging tide caused the Songban boat to capsize immediately. All eight people on board fell into the water. Although six people were rescued, two crew members drowned. Their bodies were recovered, but they were already dead. Yesterday morning, Wang Bingsheng, the neighborhood chief of the 24th Bao, 3rd Tu, reported it to the local court, requesting an inquest. Prosecutor Li Caigui and Inquest Officer Shen Qixiu arrived at the scene to examine the bodies and ordered them placed in coffins.</p>
<h3>The Mourning and Honor of Jiang Futang</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang Baoliang, the interpreter assigned by the Municipal Council Police Department to the First Special District Court, recently lost his father, Mr. Futang, who had just passed his sixtieth birthday. Unexpectedly, he fell ill this spring, and medical treatment was ineffective. He passed away on March 22nd at his residence at No. 18 Shou Kang Li, Chengdu Road, Xinzha Road, Shanghai. Mr. Jiang and his siblings, known for their filial piety, are deeply saddened by the loss. The funeral is scheduled for the 15th of this month at Jingtu Nunnery, Guling Road, Xinzha Road. Laudatory messages and elegiac couplets from prominent figures of the time, including Chairman Lin, and the presidents of the five yuan: Wang, Ju, Yu, Sun, Dai, Chief Secretary Chu, Minister of Justice Wang, as well as Duan Qirui of Hefei, Xiao Fulao, and the city's Mayor Wu, Chief of Security Yang, and celebrities from all walks of life, are numerous and varied. It is expected that many will attend the funeral in simple carriages, making it a scene of great mourning and honor.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Long-Distance Telephone: Trial Call Successful; Construction of Iron Supports Underway; Official Call Service to Begin October 1st</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong long-distance wireless telephone, with the Shanghai equipment already installed and the Guangdong project nearing completion, has recently undergone trial calls, which have been quite successful. Both stations are now rushing to construct the iron supports under the antennas, with the official opening of the call service expected on October 1st of this year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Equipment Now Installed</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong long-distance wireless telephone project, after several discussions between the Ministry of Communications and the Guangdong Provincial Government, saw Guangdong send Deng Zongyao, the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Automatic Telephone Management Committee and director of the Guangzhou Telephone Bureau, to Shanghai for negotiations. Deng also escorted construction materials back to Guangdong. According to the agreed construction plan, both sides began work. Shanghai designated Zhenru as the main telephone station. After the International Telecommunications Bureau began construction, which has taken several months, it is reported that all equipment has now been installed. The installation of the iron supports under the antennas is currently underway. This project will take two months to complete.</p>
<p>Guangdong Project Mostly Complete</p>
<p>The Guangdong telephone station was also selected at Shipai. Since the China Electric Company, which contracted the project, began construction in cooperation with the Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction and the Municipal Government, the project has progressed rapidly and is mostly complete. The required equipment has also been purchased in England by the Wu Geng Material Procurement Committee and shipped to Guangdong. The installation of the iron supports is also currently underway.</p>
<p>Trial Call Held, Results Satisfactory</p>
<p>With the equipment installation on both sides completed, a trial call was immediately held. The results were quite satisfactory. It is understood that the equipment is extremely complex and will require several more trial calls. The official opening date will be October 1st, as the iron support project under the antennas is extensive and will take two months to complete.</p>
<h3>Thunderstorm Yesterday Afternoon Sparks Unfounded Rumors; No Cases of Electrocution or Shattered Rocks Found Upon Investigation</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:40 PM, the sky was overcast and threatening rain. Suddenly, there was a flash of lightning and a crash of thunder, but no rain fell. After the thunder, rumors spread that someone had been electrocuted near the Little West Gate. The news spread quickly, and many people flocked to the area to find out what had happened, causing crowds to gather near Shangwen and Zhonghua Roads in the Little West Gate area. In reality, nothing had happened. Police officers stationed around the area, fearing trouble, worked hard to maintain traffic, but the crowds only grew larger. Then, rumors spread that lightning had struck a millstone. It was said that a broken millstone was outside the house (located on Xueqian Street) of Zhou Zenglu, a local resident who owns a rice shop at No. 100 Shangwen Road, Little West Gate. A square blue stone was also mentioned. The crowds claimed that the stone had been shattered by lightning. To verify the truth, a reporter entered the premises and observed that the cracks in the millstone were filled with dirt, indicating that they were old. The blue stone was intact. The story of the lightning-struck millstone was entirely a rumor. Even by evening, groups of people were still wandering around, peering about. It was a case of needless alarm.</p>

<h3>Public Concession: Captured Kidnappers and Notorious Thieves Must Be Investigated Further</h3>
<p>Kidnappers</p>
<p>After learning that kidnappers were hiding at No. 59 Wu Yu Li, Maxierti Road, French Concession, Detective Superintendent Yu A-gen and Detective Superintendent Liu Junqing of the Lao Zha Detective Division led detectives such as Xu Dezhong and cooperated with detectives from the French Concession to arrest them at around 8 AM on the 5th. Wang Chunqi from Shaoxing, a woman named Wang Chen, and other individuals were arrested and taken to the detective division for questioning. Investigations revealed that Wang was a notorious Ningbo bandit who had been wanted by the Ningbo authorities for kidnapping the child of a wealthy family for ransom. His real name was Wang Miaosheng. He was immediately detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division I of the First Special District Court. The detective division's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the suspect's involvement in kidnapping cases within the concession was still being investigated in detail, and requested permission for detention. Presiding Judge Ma Shide approved the detention for one week.</p>
<p>Notorious Thieves</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspectorate led detectives Wang Ying, Zhang Yunhong, Chen Yonggui, Bao Jisheng, and others, fully armed, to Room 35 of the Jiahe Hotel at No. 158 Fujian Road. They arrested notorious thieves Qiu Shuiquan, Yin Binxing, Ma Qingjia, and Yu Zilin from Shaoxing, seizing six firearms and seven bullets. Later, Hu Wenxing was apprehended at No. 56 Fenzhou Road. Investigations revealed that the arrested criminals had all been sentenced to five to six years in prison for previous kidnapping cases. After a major commutation, they were released. However, they proved incorrigible and committed six theft cases within the concession. Yesterday morning, the detective division's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, also requested the First Special District Court to approve their detention for further investigation. Presiding Judge Feng approved the detention.</p>
<h3>Threw Bag of Excrement During "White Snake" Performance: Sixth Grader Takes Revenge, Wu Ma and Others Suffer Unpleasant Taste</h3>
<p>—Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment—</p>
<p>The Huaiyang Grand Theater at No. 158 Wuzhou Road has been performing "The Tale of the White Snake" recently, and business has been good. On the 7th of this month, Gao, a sixth grader from Jiangbei, attempted to watch the performance without purchasing a ticket and was ejected by the ticket inspector. Gao harbored resentment and sought revenge. On the evening of the 8th, he went to see the performance again, sitting in the fifth row of the upper level. At 11:10 PM, during the scene where the real and fake White Snakes were battling, it was necessary to completely extinguish the theater's lights. Gao saw this as his opportunity and threw a package of yellowish-white matter he had brought with him downwards. It landed on the bodies of audience members Wu Ma, Wu Xiaolan, Jiang Zhu, and Gu Jin, covering them in excrement and causing them to experience an unpleasant taste. Fortunately, the theater's deputy manager, Wu Tingzhi, was nearby when Gao threw the excrement and immediately apprehended him. Detective Xu Zhiqing and the police arrived and took Gao into custody at the Jiaxing Road Police Station, before sending him to Criminal Division V of the First Special District Court. Judge Ye Shengchao opened the court and questioned him. Detective Division lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, charging him under Article 319 of the Criminal Code. Considering the reprehensible nature of the act, he requested a severe sentence to deter others. The victims, Wu Ma and others, then testified about the incident. Gao confessed to throwing the excrement, claiming he was instructed to do so by Da Pubao Lao Hai and others. Judge Ye, after considering the evidence, sentenced Gao to three months imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Detective Division Negotiates with Customs to Intercept Wiley's Stolen Goods; Russian Man Shipping to Zhifu; Still Requires Identification by Wiley</h3>
<p>Wiley Jewelers, located at No. 715 Nanjing Road, was burglarized on May 15th of this year at 2:12 PM. Jewelry worth over 100,000 yuan was stolen. The various detective divisions paid close attention to this case and made every effort to investigate, but without success. Gromoff, chief detective of the Municipal Council Police Department, and detective Shannikov, learned that a Russian man named Ai Wulunqi at a jewelry store on Minhang Road was shipping a package to Zhifu containing jewelry that might be the stolen goods from Wiley. They went to Zhifu and obtained the consent of the Customs Commissioner to temporarily detain some of the jewelry in Ai's package, worth about 20,000 yuan, and brought it back to the detective division. Yesterday morning, they requested Feng Shide, president of the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, to allow the jewelry to be temporarily stored in the detective division. Detective Division lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that the jewelry had not yet been identified by Wiley Jewelers, so it was difficult to determine whether it was stolen goods. It could only be confirmed after the original owner identified it. President Feng granted the detective division's request and ordered the jewelry to be temporarily stored in the detective division.</p>
<h3>US Horticultural Federation International Tour Group Visits China; Members Are Wealthy North American Women; City Government Instructs Women's Organizations to Host</h3>

They have been making efforts to promote domestic goods. Recently, Changsha and Tianjin both plan to organize national products exhibitions. Qi Shao'an, the secretary of the Hebei Provincial Department of Construction and director of the National Products Exhibition Hall, came to Shanghai for this purpose, to negotiate and investigate various industries. Xu Jianruo, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Citizens' Promotion of National Goods Association, accompanied him to visit the Commodity Exhibition Center of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.

<h3>A Planned Conspiracy: Tying Up a Man and Woman and Falsely Accusing Them of Adultery - Yang Lansheng's Vicious Plot to Divorce His Wife - Fortunately, His Daughter Saw What Happened and Reported It to the Police, Revealing the Inside Story</h3>
<p>Yang Lansheng, a local resident aged thirty-six, who works as a cook in the Wan Zai military camp on Chengdu Road, married Cai more than ten years ago and lives with her at No. 7, Qijiacun, Tokyo Road, Shanghai West. During the day, the couple's relationship is considered harmonious, and they have a daughter named A'e, who is already fourteen years old. However, recently, the Yangs have become suspicious of each other. The husband accuses his wife of committing adultery with a neighbor from Changzhou, Chen Yusheng, while the wife accuses her husband of taking another concubine, leading to frequent quarrels and a breakdown in their relationship. They are incompatible, and Yang sees Cai as a thorn in his side, constantly thinking of ways to harm her so that he can find an excuse to divorce her. He discussed this with a friend known as "Old Matchmaker," and they decided to take drastic measures. At 4:50 AM on the 9th of this month, as dawn was breaking, seven or eight men in short clothes suddenly broke into Chen Yusheng's house in Qijiacun, tied up Chen's hands and feet with ropes, and stuffed paper into his mouth to prevent him from making any noise. Then they took Chen to the nearby Yang Cai's house and went straight into Cai's bedroom. These people first threw Chen onto Cai's bed and then tied up Cai as well, placing her on the same bed. They also intended to strip Cai of her clothes and then inform Cai's husband, Yang Lansheng, pretending to have caught them in the act of adultery, so that he could use this as grounds for divorce. This plan was all prearranged. Unexpectedly, Cai's daughter, Yang A'e, was horrified by the scene and rushed out to report it to the Putuo Road Police Station. The station dispatched several Chinese and foreign detectives who rushed to the scene and arrested five people on the spot: Chen Zhaorong, Xi Aliuli, Nie Rongbiao, Gong Housheng, and Zhang Hengshao. They also untied Yang Cai and Chen Yusheng, removed the paper from their mouths, and took them all to the police station. Later, Yang Lansheng was apprehended on Laobosen Road. Yesterday morning, they were all sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. In addition to prosecuting them according to Articles 316 and 230 of the Criminal Law, the police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, also stated the above situation. Subsequently, Yang Cai and Chen Yusheng filed a case, proving that they were forcibly tied up by the defendants and accused of adultery. They also stated that they did not know each other and were falsely accused. When questioned, the defendants admitted to the accusations. After Judge Liu Yugui verified the confession, he ordered that the case be adjourned and retried this Friday.</p>
<h3>After the Yongxing Money Shop Closed Down - The New Culture Press Sues - For Owed Debts of Over 24,000 Yuan - Sues All Shareholders for Joint Debt Settlement</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Bank was founded by Yu Zhendong and others, with Yu serving as the president. During this Dragon Boat Festival, it became difficult to overcome difficulties, and it has already announced the suspension of business due to insufficient capital turnover. In addition to running the bank, Yu also jointly opened the Yongxing Money Shop with Chen Jingtao, Chen Dizhou, Guo Ruoyu, Chen Zhongchi, Chen Meibo, and others, with Chen Jingtao serving as the manager. The shop also fell victim to the current economic crisis and closed down before Jiangnan Bank. The amount of debt it owes is very large. Now, the creditor, New Culture Press, has hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a lawsuit against all the shareholders of Yongxing Shop, including Yu Zhendong, Chen Jingtao, Chen Dizhou, Guo Ruoyu, Chen Zhongchi, and Chen Meibo. The lawsuit states that Yongxing was jointly opened by the defendants, with Chen Jingtao as the manager. The plaintiff originally had no dealings with them. In February of this year, the defendants suddenly sent their street salesman, Shao Xianglin, to persuade them to deposit funds, boasting about how stable and reliable they were. The plaintiff then successively deposited 24,600 yuan, holding a passbook as proof. Last month, they needed to withdraw a portion of the funds, and the shop issued a bill for 14,280 yuan. However, when it came time to cash it on April 20th, the business was already closed. For more than a month now, they have entrusted people to liquidate the assets, but the matter has been delayed repeatedly. They have ignored both the bill and the remaining deposit of 10,320 yuan. It is found that the defendants are partners of Yongxing and wealthy merchants in Shanghai, and they should bear joint and several liability for the debts. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued orders that shareholders of bankrupt money shops should be fully liable for repayment. Otherwise, not only will individual assets be affected, but the social economy will also be disrupted. Therefore, they specially request a judgment ordering the repayment of the full amount plus interest. If the shop's assets are insufficient to cover the debt, then the defendants should be ordered to jointly repay it. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong of the First Special District Court opened the court to summon and interrogate the defendants, but none of them appeared. The plaintiff's agent, Fan Chun, and his lawyer, Chen Tingrui, presented the reasons for the lawsuit. The court then ordered that the defendants be summoned to appear at a later date for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Vocational Youth Life Improvement Association - Mao Zhenchu and Others Initiate Organization</h3>
<p>Mao Zhenchu, secretary and director of general affairs of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, Guo Chongjie, editor-in-chief of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and others, considering the large number of young people serving in the vocational sector in Shanghai, numbering in the tens of thousands, who have no organization and are unable to improve themselves, and given the current social instability, are generally experiencing depression in their lives. This depression in life leads to either extreme hedonism or complete negativity. Not only are the vocational youths themselves lifeless, but they will also be on the path to destruction. The losses to the country and society are even greater. Vocational youths are distributed in all aspects of society, and their position in society is worthy of cherishing. If they do not strive for self-improvement, it will make the turbulent society even more unstable. Therefore, more than one hundred vocational youths jointly initiated the organization of the "Shanghai Vocational Youth Life Improvement Association." Based on the principle of self-help and helping others, they have been supported by people from all walks of life, including Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, Yang Weiyu, Xiang Kangyuan, and Jia Foru. Last month, a general meeting of initiators was convened, and the declaration and draft charter were passed on the spot. Mao Zhenchu, Wang Jianmin, He Jingyu, Guo Chongjie, Gongsun Min, Chen Guanlin, Cheng Keguang, Wang Qixu, and Hu Weijian were elected as nine preparatory committee members responsible for carrying out the work. They have received a certificate of permission to establish the association from the Municipal Party Headquarters and will convene a general meeting soon to formally announce its establishment. The current address of the association is Room 311, Silk Industry Building, East Shilu, Hankou Road. It is said that they are currently publicly soliciting members. Any vocational youth in the city can join by stating their name, age, place of service, address, and other information. The origin and work outline of the association are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Origin: We and others serve in Shanghai. Although our occupations are not entirely the same, we have common feelings. This is the depression in life and the hunger for knowledge. Since we left school and entered society, all aspects of our material and spiritual life, such as clothing, food, housing, transportation, knowledge, hygiene, and friendship, are far from our ideals. At first, we resisted, but eventually, we were assimilated by the environment and fell into a deep abyss of decadence and depression. Looking at the future, we cannot help but feel apprehensive. Therefore, there is the initiation of the "Shanghai Vocational Youth Life Improvement Association." However, our knowledge and ability are limited. The development of this association depends on the enthusiastic participation of like-minded people. Therefore, we use the meaning of the birds chirping to seek friends to work together. We respectfully state the origin to be the starting point. May our comrades consider it. All organizational matters will be handled in accordance with legal procedures and will be absolutely open. We hope that all comrades who join will give full play to their high opinions and help with great efforts so that the association's affairs can progress daily.</p>

<h3>Family Suicide Case - Yue Lin Accused of Inciting Suicide - Nine-Year-Old Girl Who Was Rescued Summoned to Court - Old Yue's Tears Flow as He Begs the Judge for Mercy</h3>
<p>Yue Lin, a 51-year-old Beiping native living on the third floor of the Peng Yulai cake shop at 171 Avenue Dubail in the French Concession, due to unemployment and economic pressure, swallowed raw opium with his wife, Wang, and their eight children on the evening of the 30th of last month. Yue himself took a lighter dose and did not die until the next morning. He went out to throw himself into the river and was rescued, only to discover the tragedy at home. His wife and three sons and two daughters died because they could not be saved. Only the nine-year-old girl, Xiaoyun, was sent to the hospital and rescued. The French police suspected Yue Lin of inciting suicide and sent him to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, and clerk Zheng Rong went to the First Criminal Court to interrogate him. First, Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer representing the police department, stated the case, saying that the defendant Yue Lin sent his four-month-old daughter to the Renji Nursery Hall at 4:00 PM on the 30th of the month. At about 6:00 PM, he returned home, and his wife and six children had already swallowed opium. At 9:00 PM, Yue and his wife also took poison at the same time. The police department cannot investigate the part about the six children taking poison. As for Yue's wife, Wang, the defendant is suspected of inciting or assisting in suicide. He is now being prosecuted in accordance with Article 290 of the Criminal Law and requests that he be interrogated and judged according to the law. Then, the detective in charge of this case, Yu Yutian, reported the investigation process and said that he had interrogated the rescued nine-year-old girl in the hospital, who said that the opium was ordered to be swallowed by her father. Please summon her daughter Xiaoyun for interrogation. At this point, Yue Lin's eldest son, Guangfu, brought his sister, Xiaoyun, to the case. Yue could not help but feel sad when he saw his children, and tears flowed down his face. The official asked Xiaoyun, but because she was young and did not understand, she could not answer. The police then questioned her, but she answered that she did not know anything. The official then questioned Yue Lin, who said that he did not know that his wife intended to commit suicide. However, he usually said that he did not want to be poor and ashamed. He did not know where she got the opium this time. When I took the little girl to the nursery and returned home, she said to me that the children had already taken poison, fearing that they would become beggars in the future. I also advised her that we still have ten or eight yuan to live on, and we should wait until there is no way to make a decision. Later, the children went upstairs to sleep, not noisy, not crying, not shouting in pain, and fell asleep. I really didn't discuss or conspire to commit suicide beforehand. Afterwards, my mind was confused, and this happened. I beg for mercy. The court also summoned Chen Dezhi (from Chongming), the second landlord of Yue's cake shop, as a witness to inquire about Yue's daily situation. Chen said that Yue rented my house, and the rent was six and a half yuan per month. I don't know how his situation is because he usually enters and exits through the back door. I only learned about the poisoning after receiving a message. At this point, the police department's lawyer, Yao, expressed his opinion, saying that based on the facts, the defendant had the determination to die together, but according to the regulations, he should be exempt from punishment. The official said that the point of the defendant sending the four-month-old girl to the nursery still needs to be investigated. He ordered that the case be adjourned and retried on the 15th, and the defendant will remain in custody for further instructions.</p>

<h3>Hu Die to Return Triumphant - Lin Xuehuai Passes Away Yesterday - Willed Depleted After Lost Love and Entangled by Illness - Gaunt and Dark Remains, No Longer the Elegant Young Man of Yore</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Our country's movie actress Hu Die, after participating in the Soviet Union International Film Festival and traveling to various European countries, is about to return. Unexpectedly, Lin Xuehuai, who introduced her to the film industry and once pledged to be together for life, only to have the Xue Die marriage change, passed away. This is enough for those who pay attention to Xue Die to sigh. Hu Die will likely feel sorrow upon learning of this bad news overseas.</p>
<p>First Meeting of Xue Die: Lin Xuehuai was 34 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong. He was handsome and good at photography. He joined the Youlian Film Company founded by Chen Kangran, a director at the Yihua Film Company, as a professional member. He then met Hu Die. Because of her graceful and charming nature, he tried his best to introduce her to Youlian as an actress. This is when she entered the film industry. Lin initially starred in the "Tea Picking Girl" film at the Baihe Company. His first film at the Mingxing Company was "The Last Conscience." Then he co-starred with Hu Die in the "Autumn Fan Complaint," and Hu Die's reputation gradually rose. She then transferred to the Tianyi Company and then to Mingxing, to this day. According to Lin Xuehuai's brother-in-law, Zheng Jingan, to the Central News Agency reporter, Hu's parents married her to Lin because of his encouragement.</p>
<p>Engagement in the Ballroom: The Yuegong Ballroom on North Sichuan Road happened to open at this time. Lin and Hu held their engagement ceremony on the opening day. Many people from all walks of life attended, and a tea dance was held. At that time, Yuegong was quite outstanding among Shanghai ballrooms, and those who participated in this grand event can still talk about it with relish.</p>
<p>Sudden Marriage Change: Later, Hu Die's artistic career became increasingly successful, and her status gradually increased. Later, she was even selected as the so-called "Chinese Film Queen," while Lin was unsuccessful and frustrated. The difference in social status increased, and the discord between the two sexes became apparent. Thus, the Xue Die marriage change case arose. Many people in society know about this process. In the end, Lin lost the lawsuit, and the stimulation he received must have been very great.</p>
<p>After Lost Love: After Lin retired from the film industry, he relied on his photography skills to make a living. He set up Xuehuai Photography Studio behind the Xin Xin Company and then transferred it to others. He then went to Suzhou with several thousand yuan to set up Xuehuai Photography Studio at the entrance of Zouqian Palace Lane. His life was still not bad. However, not long after opening, it was sealed up because he lost the Xue Die lawsuit. Lin lost love with Die, and was affected by the bad environment afterwards. The stimulation must have been even more painful.</p>
<p>Developed Cancer: Years ago, Lin developed cancer in the cheekbone area due to depression. He suffered greatly. In June of last year, he went to the Red Cross Hospital for examination. At that time, his body was very good. The doctor said, "Your body should be better than it is now six months ago. Six months later, it will be weaker. Your life is only a year away." He then used radium needles for treatment and received seven radiotherapy sessions at Yangshupu Sacred Heart Hospital. After recovery, it relapsed in less than a month. He traveled around, but medical treatment was ineffective. He then came to Shanghai and rented a residence at No. 6 Yongqing Lane, Ailaige Road, French Concession, to recuperate.</p>
<p>Passed Away Yesterday Afternoon: At 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon, Lin passed away due to illness. He left behind his wife, Wang Peizhen, (a local, 24 years old, who was in a free love relationship and married for less than three years,) and a daughter, Meimei, (one year old). Lin's brother-in-law, Zheng Jingan, helped to handle the funeral arrangements and sent the body to the Chinese Funeral Home on Haige Road for embalming. The coffin will be placed on the 13th and the funeral will be held at 1:00 PM on the 14th. According to Zheng Jingan, Lin's finances were quite tight due to years of illness. However, he had many friends during his lifetime. Those who intend to carry the coffin should bring their own vehicles. The photography studio in Suzhou may be continued by his widow. The Central News Agency reporter once visited Lin's mortuary. Lin had already been made up and dressed in a long gown and mandarin jacket. However, his face was gaunt and dark, no longer the elegant young man of yore.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of Flower Shop Apprentice Crushed to Death by Car - Private Prosecution Part Already Settled</h3>
<p>Tan Yunxiang's youngest son, Longgen, a local resident living at No. 91 Kongjiaqiao, Jixifeier Road, Public Concession, is sixteen years old this year. He has been an apprentice at the Guba Flower Shop at No. 124 Guba Road, French Concession, for four years. He is intelligent and capable, so he is deeply valued by the shop owner. He is in charge of all the shop's affairs. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, Longgen was free and riding a bicycle for recreation. At 9:20 PM, he rode his bicycle out of Lane 156 of Guba Road and turned east. At that time, a car No. 18566 of Xiangsheng Motor Company, driven by Zhang Acai (23 years old), was speeding south on Guba Road. He failed to brake and avoid it, causing Tan Longgen to be knocked down with his bicycle, and his abdomen and left leg were scratched by the iron bar under the car. The police saw this, recorded the number, and took the injured person and the car to the Fuxu Police Station. The injured person was sent to Guangci Hospital, where doctors performed surgery and treatment, but he died of his injuries at 9:00 PM the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was carried to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. Yesterday, the police station reported to the Special Court, and Prosecutor Wang Ren, forensic doctor Jiang Xuan, and clerk Zhao Yifen went to the funeral home to examine the body. They sat in public and questioned the defendant Zhang Acai and witnesses about the accident. The body was handed over to Tan Yunxiang, who applied to collect the body for burial. The official examined and found that Tan Longgen had been injured by a car and died. The body was collected by the family. Whether the defendant was negligent will be investigated and dealt with by the police department. It is heard that the police station investigated the negligence and found that it was due to the deceased. As for the private prosecution for compensation, the defendant has asked someone to mediate a settlement with the family of the deceased and compensated 300 yuan to close the case.</p>
<h3>Pawned White Silk Switched Case - Two Criminals Detained Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>On October 16th at 11:15 AM, Zhou Xingshun and Li Aqing, from Ningbo, went to the Yuandian Pawnshop at No. 182 Wuzhou Road to pawn white silk worth five yuan. They used a switching trick to fraudulently obtain money and divide the loot. After the case was discovered, they were arrested by Chinese detective Zhou Yushan and detective Ma Binggui. The investigation revealed that they had used the same method to defraud more than 20 pawnshops, including Qiande at No. 296 Zhoujiazhulu, Fujia at No. 40 Fanjialu, Yongkang at No. 259 Oujialu, Baoyuan at No. 231 Donghan Bili Road, and Xiechang at No. 510 Haining Road, of more than 70 yuan. They were sent to the First Special District Court. However, the victims could not all attend, and the court ordered them to be remanded in custody. Yesterday, Judge Xiang Yinghua went to the Third Criminal Court to interrogate them. The Municipal Council's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, said that only five pawnshops had sent representatives to the court, and the rest were of the same nature, so they were not fully prosecuted. The witnesses stated the process of the two defendants switching the white silk. Zhou Xingshun and Li Aqing's confessions were cunning, and they hired lawyers to defend them. Judge Xiang ordered them to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of Unnamed Man Who Fell to His Death Watching a Free Show</h3>
<p>At 10:45 PM the night before last, a man of about seventeen or eighteen years old, wearing a white cloth short shirt and gray shorts, climbed onto the glass ceiling of the roof of a certain stage on Yunnan Road, Fuzhou Road, while the Four Volumes of Ji Gong's Biography and the Treasure Theft in the Xiangfu were being performed. He was watching a free show. Unexpectedly, the glass broke under the weight, causing the man to fall onto the stage. He was severely injured at the time. After reporting to the Laoku Police Station, an ambulance was summoned and he was taken to the Second Hospital for treatment. He died shortly after treatment was ineffective. Detective Xue Youwen was dispatched to investigate, but he could not find his family. Therefore, it is still unknown who he is. The body was carried to the Feilun Road Autopsy Room. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Tang and others to examine the body. According to Chinese Police Chief Zhang Wenjun's report of the previous situation, Mr. Tang ordered that the deceased, an unnamed man, had fallen to his death. Since no family was found, the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<p>Liang Huang, an old woman from Shaoxing, is 62 years old and lives with her daughter, Fu Liang, 40 years old, at No. 42 Laiyi Wharf Outside Street in the South City. The relationship between the mother and daughter is considered harmonious. At about 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, the woman took cold porridge to fill her hunger. Her daughter saw this and advised her mother not to eat cold food and to take cake from the room to fill her hunger. Unexpectedly, the old woman, for some unknown reason, suddenly had the idea of ending her life and secretly swallowed opium. At 3:00 PM, she began to groan in bed. Her daughter heard the sound and rushed over. Seeing her mother's pale face and rapid breathing, she knew that she had taken poison. She immediately hired a car to take her to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. However, the woman was old and weak, and had taken too much poison, so she could not be saved.

<h3>Paris Theater Showing Soviet Russian Song and Dance Film</h3>
<p>The Paris Theater on Avenue Joffre is known for showing famous Soviet Russian films. The most valuable Soviet Russian films are often premiered at this theater. The Soviet Russian films that we have seen so far describe social anecdotes and the history of work struggles. Song and dance films have never been seen before. This time, the theater suddenly transported a Soviet Russian song and dance film. However, its style is definitely not like Hollywood's song and dance films that attract people with legs. It also has a profound meaning, implementing that music is the highest quality in art and can move sentient beings. The film tells the story of a flute player who brings many livestock to a grand banquet because of his flute playing. Beasts and humans get along in the same hall, devouring at will. A group of top-hatted gentlemen are all frightened and retreat. In fact, the gentlemen's level of musical appreciation is not even as good as that of the animals. The satire is profound, and the interest is deep. It is definitely not comparable to ordinary song and dance films. It is heard that this film will be publicly screened at the theater starting tomorrow.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Microorganism)</p>
<p>The clamor for gender equality is deafening, but in trams and buses, we always only see "men giving way to women" seats, but never "women giving way to men" seats. Is this also considered gender equality!</p>
<p>Soft straw can bind hard tree firewood, which is called "soft firewood binding hard firewood" - the soft eats the hard. How is it different in the world when people deal with each other? When people glare and shout and let off a "big firecracker," I gently pour a ladle of "cold water" on it. The fuse is damp, and I guarantee it won't explode.</p>
<p>Urbanites enjoy all the other blessings; in the summer, they use electric fans and cool radiators; in the winter, they use electric heaters and warm radiators, but the "blessing of eating" and the "blessing of sleeping" cannot be compared to us country folks. Fresh and lively "fish and shrimp" are bought from the boat lady's hand as soon as they are caught, and fried in a hot pot. As soon as the sun goes down, after eating dinner, we undress and "fall asleep," and search in our dreams.</p>
<h3>Yang Jiaoshan Was a Musician</h3>
<p>— Chen Tuigan</p>
<p>Everyone who reads history knows that Mr. Yang Jiaoshan (Jisheng) of the Ming Dynasty was impeached for advising against opening the horse market. Later, he was promoted to Deputy Director of the Military Selection Department of the Ministry of War. He was killed for accusing Yan Song. Commentators say that the gentleman devoted his life to economics, but they did not know that he was also a musician. The other day, I saw Mr. Li Zhuowu's Chronicle of Yang Jiaoshan at a friend's house, which roughly said: When the gentleman was 34 years old and served as the Director of the Ministry of Personnel in Nanjing, he once studied rhythm and pitch with Han Gong Bangqi, Minister of War, and mastered its numbers in three months. Jiaoshan believed that music was not comparable to other studies. One cannot just talk about it; one must be able to make instruments and music oneself, and broadcast it in sound. Only when all are in harmony can one be called a musician. Therefore, he purchased knives, drills, axes, saws, tung wood, bamboo, silk, and lacquer. He first tried to make pipes, and then made zithers, harps, sheng, xiao, xun, chi, and the like. When he tried them, the sounds were all harmonious. When he combined all the instruments to play together, they were as consistent as one and all harmonious. Later, Han Gong ordered Jiaoshan to try to make twelve pipes of temperament, each with five notes and seven tones to form a tune. Jiaoshan exhausted his thoughts and neglected sleep and food for three days, and suddenly realized something. He finally made twelve pipes and presented them to Han Gong. From this, it is known that the name of music has spread throughout Nanjing. According to my research, Jiaoshan's reputation for being proficient in music was overshadowed by his integrity and loyalty, which led to its lack of transmission. It is truly regrettable. In recent years, Chinese people have been competing to study Western music, and no one has been able to improve the original Chinese music. If the method of making the twelve pipes musical instruments by Jiaoshan can be passed down, then there will also be a [blank] splendor in the aspect of national music.</p>
<h3>Salesmen on the Tram</h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>Recently, on trams on various routes, there is often a person carrying a small leather suitcase. He does not occupy a seat, but just stands in the middle. After saying "Ladies and gentlemen," he starts reciting. He speaks very quickly, as if he is singing a flowing opera. Whether he sells raisins, sweets, toothbrushes, peppermint lozenges, or Min Tan, the style of their speeches is mostly the same. He says that he is doing advertisements on the tram, and the price is particularly low; major companies such as Lao Da Fang and Tianlu Pharmacy also sell them, but the price is not as cheap as his. Then he takes out some samples from his leather suitcase for everyone to try. Sometimes it is two raisins, rolled in a thin piece of paper, and each person is given a share. Some people take it and eat it politely; some people take it in their hands embarrassedly. But no one is willing to spend two dimes to buy five packs of his. So the frustrated salesman gets off the bus.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wanted to go to Carter Road. During the long tram journey, several salesmen came one after another. One was selling Min Tan. After his speech, every passenger had a Min Tan in their mouth. Perhaps it was because of the hot weather and dry mouth, everyone welcomed the Min Tan and made a few dimes in transactions. A little later, another person came to sell peppermint lozenges. As usual, after finishing his speech, he lightly rubbed the peppermint on each guest's temples and under the nostrils to test its effectiveness. He was very fair, and even the modern lady sitting diagonally across from me was rubbed twice. When all the passengers' eyes were focused on her face, she turned red with embarrassment. In order to cover up her shame, she simply dug out two dimes from her silver clip and bought a lozenge. Sure enough, the atmosphere eased as a result.</p>
<p>Although salesmen on the tram is a clever form of business, I always think that it hinders the order on the tram a bit.</p>
<h3>Miss Guo</h3>
<p>— Xiaodong</p>
<p>When Miss Guo was seventeen, she was still a naive girl in Town S. After living in Port S with her mother for five years, she actually turned into a city lady. Her fluffy hair was tied with a black satin floral hoop; long eyelashes were under her slender painted eyebrows, and her cherry lips were slightly lipsticked. Although her face was not powdered, she already felt very charming and moving! The new fashions of the era changed several times a day, making the young men of Town S madly infatuated!</p>
<p>According to Mr. Chun's comments, Miss Guo's face is not very beautiful, but her clothes are very alluring. Her figure is somewhat like the movie star Greta Garbo, and she speaks fluent Shanghai dialect. Such a woman was seen for the first time ever in Town S. Mr. Chun often said to his friends: "I've seen thousands of scorpions, but I've never seen such a lovely girl. My eyes are dazzled and it's hard to speak, and my soul has flown away for half a day." She has such intoxicating magic, no wonder she has caused a sensation in the entire Town S.</p>
<p>What Miss Guo did in Port S is quite suspicious to idle people. Most people speculate and explore, and are sure that she is a dancer, because she speaks very fluently about dancing. However, Miss Guo has a strange temper and is unwilling to entertain people when she sees them. This is the factor that brought her trouble, so she cannot be allowed to stay in Town S. But if she is not a business person, why bother to entertain these mad bees and butterflies? Although she left Town S, her reputation is kept clear, but there are many people who miss her after she left.</p>

<h3>A Strange Man in the Plague Hospital</h3>
<p>— Yi Sheng</p>
<p>In early summer, the hottest day of the year arrived. Di, feeling the threat of the scorching heat, quickly recalled an experience I personally had last summer, worth recording. A little after three o'clock before dawn, a burst of stomach pain woke me up. The pain was followed by diarrhea, which got increasingly worse. I decided to go to the plague hospital. I asked about the nearest one, but the alarming consultation fee forced me to endure until after seven o'clock before going. After the examination, they said I needed to be hospitalized. My family helped me upstairs. The floor was divided into two rows of wards, with a corridor in the middle. I entered a second-class ward in the first room on the north side, and, exhausted, fell asleep.</p>
<p>"... Gao Ma, ah... buy him ice cream, ah... let him eat it, ah, it's so hot, ah... Gao Ma, ah, fix it, ah..."</p>
<p>This unexpected, drawn-out, upside-down kind of shouting startled me awake. It was ceaseless. After a while, the Yangzhou accent revealed that the only maid was yelling and promising from afar, trying to stop him from making noise. It was quiet for a while, but soon he started with new tricks:</p>
<p>"Sell tofu pudding, ah... let him eat it, ah... go buy it, ah, Gao Ma, ah..."</p>
<p>The impatient scolding was also in Yangzhou dialect and could silence the noise for five minutes. Afterward, the "old noise returned," but the object of the call, Gao Ma, was changed to Miss Wang. The pleading voice continued persistently, as if it would not stop until it achieved its goal. The accommodating, sometimes scolding, sometimes coaxing tone told everyone that Miss Wang was the nurse, and she was responsible for taking care of this gentleman.</p>
<p>After my accompanying family member investigated, they reported to me like telling a story, breaking the mystery of this period, although it still didn't solve the annoyance of continuing to hear the strange shouts.</p>
<p>In the last first-class room in the south row, lived a middle-aged man. This man had a long beard, messy hair, a thin, pale face, bare feet in leather slippers, and was still wearing a cotton-padded jacket and pants. He paced back and forth in the room. If he saw someone peeking, he would know to stop shouting temporarily. After people watched for a long time, they didn't want to avoid him anymore.</p>
<p>According to the hospital servant, Gao Ma, "This man's family was originally quite well-off, and he had talent. While living here, besides eating and drinking, he would occasionally recite lines from books or say a few words in a foreign language. It was only because he was doing business on the stock exchange that he made a lot of money. Last year, one night, one of his young, playful disciples started teasing the master, pretending to be serious and scaring him, saying, 'The market has changed a lot today, and your business will lose to a certain extent!' He was immediately frightened and went crazy. Although they tried to explain it in every way and prove the truth, nothing worked! The hospital director is related to him and let him stay in the hospital for treatment. He came here after the plague hospital opened last year and has been here ever since. We have suffered enough from him! His family, even his wife, are so annoyed by his nonsense that they have lost heart and are not happy to visit him, but they leave some money for him to use, to support him in his old age!"</p>
<p>Although I didn't have the ability to watch this farce continue and couldn't stand the afternoon sun shining through the north window, which might cause a plague, I requested to be discharged from the hospital that day. I didn't object to this half-crazy, half-awake strange man continuing to live there, eating some seasonal foods, or even some strange things he thought of, as long as all the other plague patients on the floor, out of respect for the hospital director or out of sympathy and pity, no one would take the lead in starting trouble.</p>
<p>Besides, this man went crazy because of the high heat of the stock exchange. If he wasn't allowed to live in the plague hospital, where else could he live? His relative's decision to let him stay was indeed very appropriate. He is truly a wonderful person!</p>
<p>I don't know if this man is still in this plague hospital this year. I miss this poor, strange man!</p>
<h3>A Record of Incense Drifting from the Imperial Boat</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Its top was also exquisitely carved and lacquered with a row of glazed tiles using the best wood. From a distance, it looked no different from the real thing, which shows the exquisite construction! The Empress Dowager herself sat on this imperial boat, and four of us eight female officials—I was one of them—were selected to accompany her on the boat. This could be considered a fully aristocratic suburban banquet.</p>
<p>Once the Empress Dowager decided, everyone in the palace immediately busied themselves with preparations. First, everyone gathered around her at the dock where the imperial boat was moored, watching the little eunuchs in charge of rowing the boat tidy up the oars and stand in their designated positions. Then, we four female officials carefully helped the Empress Dowager onto the boat, allowing the old woman to sit comfortably on her specially prepared throne. Next, someone opened the two tall, large dock doors, letting the imperial boat slowly and steadily float out. The eunuchs who rowed the boat were well-trained and could minimize the swaying common when rowing a boat.</p>
<p>After leaving the dock, there was a short tributary. After about four or five minutes, the imperial boat appeared on the mirror-like surface of Kunming Lake. The smile on the corner of the Empress Dowager's mouth, although still a smile, never disappeared. She was even happier to see the vivid lake scenery in front of her, and her eyes were filled with vibrant light. The red sun in the sky turned the lake water into a golden liquid, making her feel happy. And we all felt happy because of her happiness. (337)</p>
<h3>Crying for Xie Da's Visit to the Temple</h3>
<p>— Zheng Manqing</p>
<p>Sadly chanting, crying for Xie Da: soaking with tears, bitterly recalling the day of his death, shaking hands without a sound. Unable to bear to sit and look, unable to leave the door. Wanting to speak but sobbing again, his younger brother is there to greet me (referring to Zhiliu). Zhiliu's children stand full of the steps, how can they know the pain of what has happened? Parting in life is also a death, so desolate, like separated by generations. Returning, unable to sleep, before dawn the crows are already crowing. Sure enough, news of his death has arrived, old friends are all shocked. I doubt this, can you be reborn after death? Entrusting twin carps to summon your soul, passing words to the nine netherworlds. Only you cannot die, the mountain is not yet formed. In the hall, the white-haired mourn, throughout the land, relatives and friends cry. Soul, why don't you return, soul, how unsacred. Those who have long passed away, a sorrowful city on the land. On your birthday, you were often sick, your writing surpassing Chang Qing. Now you know nothing, people sigh that a great beam has collapsed. Having known each other for a lifetime, loving each other like brothers. The birds sing sadly in spring, who will listen to their warbling again?</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Gaining Insight, Westerners Should Build Without Regrets, Ten Kinds of Lovesickness</p>
<p>Zhiqian smiled and said, "It's not just that, I think Beihai has really fallen in love with this girl, he can't help himself. Now this girl is worried about finding a grain store because she can't solve the problem of food for her family of three. If Beihai wants to talk to her about love, he must first take care of the meals for these three people. He is still worried about not being able to fill his own stomach, how can he support two generations? Therefore, I upheld this great and impartial heart and advised her in front of the girl, hoping they would not get close." You Rong sighed and smiled: "You are wrong. People who should fall in love talk about going through fire and water without hesitation. How can lack of food be an obstacle? If this girl is willing to marry Wang Jun, they can be a poor couple. Speaking of Wang Jun, he will eventually get married. Adding a woman should not be talked about as a burden. Now it's just the girl's grandmother and mother, who are considered extra people. But Wang Jun's family are farmers. Since they can send their son out to go to school, the grain is probably enough to eat. Adding two people to eat may not be a big problem. Why don't you wait for Wang Jun to come and ask him carefully? If he really doesn't have the ability, it's not too late to dissuade him. Otherwise, facilitating other people's marriage is ten times more meritorious than saving a life. If they have no money for the wedding, to be honest, I can help with twenty or fifty dollars." Saying that, her face was full of smiles, showing a happy look. Zhiqian hesitated and stood up, looking at him. (237)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Decides to Promote Free Education Policy</h3>
<p>Implementation Details Review Completed</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) Minister of Education [name omitted] will begin implementing free education policies and convened a meeting with senior officials to discuss the promotion of free education. The Ministry of Education has determined the direction of the free education policy, and the implementation details for each region are drafted by the General Education Department and have been reviewed and completed. Within days, an order will be issued to various provinces and cities to implement it separately.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education's Zhong Daozan Inspects Qingdao's Vocational Education Report</h3>
<p>Qingdao's vocational education has a short history, starting in 1934. The private Lixian Middle School used to run several civil engineering classes, but they were suspended for a few years. Currently, the city has a senior vocational class in the municipal middle school, a junior general vocational class, a junior agriculture class at the municipal Licun Normal School, a senior civil engineering class at the private Lixian Middle School, and a junior business class at the private Chongde Middle School, totaling three senior classes and three junior classes, with a total of 224 students and expenses of 32,575 yuan. However, at the beginning of operation, the facilities are mostly simple, and the results have not yet been shown. Efforts are needed to enrich and establish a good foundation. However, the city's primary and secondary schools are able to pay attention to labor education, and the factory labor literacy education is well-managed. The points to be noted for the city's vocational education, labor education, and labor education are divided as follows: 1. Considering the current situation in the city, attention should be paid to: (1) Cooperation between the mechanical engineering department and the naval factory and Shandong University's School of Engineering, (2) Civil engineering and construction department, (3) Horticulture department focusing on the improvement of fruit trees and vegetables, and cooperation with the city's agricultural and forestry office and Shandong University's School of Agriculture, (4) Business department, (5) Home economics department can be attached to the Sacred Heart Girls' Middle School or the Municipal Girls' Middle School. When each department has achieved success, then plan to establish chemical technology and other departments. 2. Vocational students in the city value further education. Therefore, school facilities and teaching content still focus on preparing for further education. The problem of vocational training itself is neglected. It is urgent to improve teaching methods to correct their wrong ideas.</p>
<p>3. The senior and junior vocational classes of the municipal middle school lack equipment, and the curriculum is too complex. For example, the electrical engineering of the senior applied chemistry department, the electrical common sense, mechanical common sense, simple chemistry, and commercial common sense of the junior vocational department. Since the goals are not clear, learning cannot be specialized. The senior applied chemistry department only manufactures a few bars of soap in the whole year. The metal tools made by the junior department are not precise. The practice hours are few, and the content is not rich enough. It is urgent to improve.</p>
<p>Because the senior applied chemistry department of the school has no equipment, it is not as well-equipped as the mechanical department. It is planned to change to running a mechanical department. If it is implemented, the summer vacation of the second and third academic years should be fully utilized, and the duration should be extended appropriately to make up for the lack of technology in the first academic year. Even if it is not changed, it should be done in the same way to help.</p>
<p>4. The practice of the junior agricultural department of the municipal Licun Middle School uses the farm equipment of the city's agricultural and forestry office. All guidance work is done by the staff of the office, which is convenient and effective. However, there are only eight hours of practice per week, while electric training and martial arts have five hours per week. It should be improved.</p>
<p>The office plans to open another farm for students to practice. The principle of economic production should be adopted. The original farm of the office should still be used for experimental work. Third-year students should also be required to serve as interns in the office to improve their research skills.</p>
<p>5. The commercial subjects in the ordinary business department of the private Chongde Junior High School are very few. The amount of Chinese, English, Mathematics, Natural Science, History, Geography, etc. is almost the same as that of junior high school. The practice equipment only has two typewriters and a simple school store. The timetable should be rearranged to make the purpose simple and train small-scale store managers and large store clerks. 6. The curriculum of the civil engineering department of the private Lixian Middle School includes metalworking and mechanical practice and woodworking practice for two hours each. Considering the content, it has little to do with civil engineering. Woodworking practice should pay attention to house structure models. The existing tenon practice is not accurate. Architectural drawing is only two hours per week, architectural practice is only four hours, and German, Chinese, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry are all more than six hours per week. The equipment is also too simple. All should be improved.</p>
<p>7. The home economics equipment of the private Sacred Heart Girls' Middle School is perfect, and the sewing, weaving, embroidery, and jacquard results are excellent. Attention is paid to art. It should be ordered to set up a home economics department immediately.</p>
<p>8. The labor education equipment of primary and secondary schools in the city has a foundation. In the future, boys should focus on metal and woodworking, pay attention to the infusion of scientific knowledge, girls should focus on housework, pay attention to the improvement of family affairs. At the same time, labor teachers should also be trained in summer labor courses.</p>
<p>9. The labor literacy education of the Huaxin Yarn Factory is divided into four stages: (1) Literacy education for six months, (2) Civic education for six months, (3) Junior vocational tutoring for one year, (4) Senior vocational tutoring for four years. The first three are the education that ordinary workers should study, and the latter is free to choose to study. There are only more than 300 of the factory's 1,700 workers who have not received the above training. However, two classes are held every morning and evening, each lasting 80 minutes, all after work. The general workers are inevitably tired and cannot get full benefits. It can be changed to attending classes before working. Since the class time is short, it will not hinder the work, and the spirit is refreshed, and the education will be more effective. It should be consulted to the Social Affairs Bureau for consideration.</p>

<h3>Huxi Weiming Basketball Team Wins Championship</h3>
<p>Fufeng Loses 43 to 27, Placing Second</p>
<p>The final match of the 2nd Huxi Basketball Tournament between Weiming and Fufeng was held at 5 p.m. yesterday. After forty minutes of fierce battle, Weiming defeated Fufeng 43 to 27 and won the championship. In the first half, Weiming led 23 to 14. Referees Zhang Wenyuan and Shi Zhaokang immediately invited Mr. Zhou Jiaqi to present the awards after the game. Here is a brief description of the battle. Before 5 p.m., fans had already sat around the basketball court, quietly waiting for the two teams to start the game. The enthusiasm was unprecedented. As soon as 5 p.m. arrived, the referee blew the whistle to announce the start of the battle. Fufeng took the lead and immediately took a five-point lead with penalties and throws. Weiming, seeing that the situation was not good, requested a timeout. The Fufeng ball was smooth, and forward Fang Shouxiang fought alone, throwing and hitting continuously, occupying an absolute advantage of twelve to west. But after entering, Weiming cheered up unusually, catching up step by step, fighting tighter and tighter, and the scores were getting closer and closer. Until twelve to thirteen, Fufeng collapsed and was overtaken by Weiming with twenty-three to fourteen, taking the lead in the first half. Fufeng worked hard to counterattack in the afternoon, but it was beyond its ability and ran into walls everywhere. Therefore, it was eventually overtaken by Weiming all the way and did not get a chance to overtake. Looking at the skills of both sides, there are merits. Weiming's throwing skills are indeed superior, so it can win the final victory, and the defensive skills are also very impressive, but there are too many fouls, which is a deficiency. If Fufeng had scored more points in the foul penalty, the number of wins and losses would still be unknown. It turned out that Fufeng had once defeated Weiming 30 to 22 once. Now, Fufeng had 23 free throw opportunities, but only hit six times. The difference between one gain and one loss is not small. This is a major reason for Fufeng's loss. In addition, forward general Zhai Songtao was unable to participate due to illness, which was also a fatal blow to the entire team of Zaofeng. In terms of talent, Chen Tianguo, Hu Yepei, and Liang Dusheng of Weiming are all outstanding talents. Fang Shouyi, Gu Chongshan, and Sun Yiqin of Fufeng also had many good performances. It is not easy for the business community to achieve this result in amateur sports. The annual Huxi Cup basketball game ended in cheers. Here are the scores of both sides:</p>
<p>Weiming Fouls Score</p>
<p>Chen Tianguo 1 18</p>
<p>Hu Yepei 4 6</p>
<p>Liang Dusheng 4 7</p>
<p>Jin Yan 4 2</p>

<h3>Finance  Spot Trends Very Active  Gold Standard Falls Then Suddenly Rises in Reaction</h3>
<p>——Result, Agreement Two Yuan Three Jiao——</p>
<p>The gold market initially followed the rise and fall of the overseas silver market yesterday. Unexpectedly, spot sales were brisk, and adding water caused it to rise to around 30 yuan. Short-term futures presented a heavy threat to short sellers, stimulating buying and causing a rebound. The future market became uncertain. Early morning overseas calls indicated that in two days, London was even and the US rose. The forward silver price in Montreaux also rose by more than one point. Exchange rates all contracted, and London raw gold rose half a penny. People's hearts were weary, as the voices of US silver party members urging the government to make money were again high. Off-site ready transactions were sold, retreating to 6134 yuan. Buyers took advantage of the low price and were pulled up. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both the UK and the US rising. Customs gold units fell by one point, and the listed gold standard price fell to 846 yuan and eight jiao, with little impact. After opening, it was slightly stable. The exchange market was loose and excessive, fueling selling and causing a decline. However, because the Shanghai Bank worked hard to dig up spot forward orders, buyers saw low prices and acted, managing to maintain the level. The HSBC Bank's listed prices were announced, with the UK rising by 1.5 and the US rising by 2.5. The market was still in progress at this time. Later, it was heard that pure gold spot prices had actually risen by 25 yuan, and there were still many buyers, stimulating buying and causing a gradual rise. Sassoon reacted by bidding up the US dollar, and the exchange market trend broke through the 71 yuan mark. Banks took advantage of the high price to push out orders, and large accounts also had sales. Soon after, they took advantage of the situation to continue buying, gradually rising back to above 70 yuan. At noon, it was relatively stable. In the afternoon, the market was quiet, and the opening was late. After opening, buyers suddenly surged, immediately causing a price increase. Those supplying at high prices were quite strong, but because of the reported fall in Indian silver, An'na struggled more. The exchange market was normal and turned flat. Later, Indian silver fell another six An'na for the second time, and Sassoon and others continued to bid up, reporting another rise. Unexpectedly, large accounts successively unloaded their holdings, and the multi-party lineup showed signs of being unable to support the market. The market suddenly weakened at the close. The market situation for the day was weak and then firm, and it was still difficult to be certain about people's hearts. The market situation for the day will now be recorded:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 766 yuan, down 3 yuan from the closing before the break. Fuxing, Yongchun, Yuan, and Yongna strips rose from 5 yuan 7 jiao to 6 yuan 7 jiao.

Chunyuan, Yongchang, Dayifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Yongli, Dadecheng, Yuanchang, Yongfuxing, and Yongwanfeng all advanced and rose to 8 yuan and 2 jiao. Hengyu and Fuxingyong sold strips, retreating to 7 yuan. Banque de l'Indochine ate August US dollars at 875. Fuyu, Dadecheng, Richang, Fuxingyong, and Tongfengheng all advanced, and it rose to 70 yuan and 3 jiao. Yuqingyong, Yingxiang, Shenkang, and Dafa Yong took advantage of the high price to unload their holdings, retreating to 68 yuan and 4 jiao. Hengchangyong, Shunmaoyuanchang, and Yonglaijin rose to 9 yuan and 7 jiao. Dadecheng worked hard to supply strips. Fuxingyong and Dafayong also sold and fell to 7 yuan and a half. Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China bid up August US dollars at 1875, and Sassoon ate the same month at 125 and remained stable. Hengchangyong, Fuyu, Huixiang, Dadecheng, Qingfayong, and Fuxingyong jointly purchased strips, gradually rising to 70 yuan and a half. Yifengyong, Jiarun, Yuanmaoyong, and Hengxing took advantage of the high price to unload their holdings, falling to 06 jiao. Dadecheng and others continued to maintain the level. The noon close rose to 77 yuan and 9 jiao. It was stable after the close.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 773 yuan. Huixiang, Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Dadecheng, and Dafayong all advanced, rising to 6 yuan. Shenxiang and Dadecheng unloaded their holdings, falling to 3 yuan and 8 jiao. Indian silver was reported at a low of 23 An'na, and the base was stable. Although Fuxingyong advanced to 5 yuan and 2 jiao, Hengyu and Yuanmaoyong Huixiang came to sell. Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China pushed out July US dollars at 375, immediately falling back to 3 yuan and 2 jiao. Hengyu and Fuxingyong still collected, rising to 5 yuan and 2 jiao. Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China came out with July US dollars at 4375, and Anchan also sold June forward orders at 8125. Shengda, Hongkang, Yongqingfa, and Yong sold strips, retreating to 3 yuan and a half. Yongli, Fuxingyong, Wanfengheng, Yifungyong, and Chunyuanyong all came to purchase strips, rising again to 4 yuan and 7 jiao. Shengda and Yuanheng sold, falling to 3 yuan and 1 jiao. Pangeng Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China bid up July US dollars at 4375. Indian silver fell another 6.7 An'na for the first time. Fuxingyong and Dadecheng further advanced to 5 yuan and 7 jiao. Dadecheng, Yuanheng, Dalian Gang, Hengchangyong, Fuyu, and Shunmao successively unloaded their holdings. Rumor messages were slightly unfavorable, and the multi-party wavered. The close fell to 771 yuan and 3 jiao. Although Yuanchangyong and Hengxing sold after the close, buyers were still enthusiastic and it was slightly stable. It was found that the highest price of the day was 776 yuan, and the lowest price was 763 yuan and 2 jiao, a fluctuation of 13 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 points. As a result, it rebounded 1 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the closing before the break.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on the Central Bank's listed gold standard price, which fell to 846 yuan and 8 jiao, approximately 7.5 yuan lower than the closing price. This was 75 yuan less than before the break. July's account registration was 772 yuan, morning water replenishment was 770 yuan, and afternoon water replenishment was 765 yuan. The price of pure gold was charming, because silverware shops and others had an unusually healthy appetite, and industry colleagues lacked supply. This was due to the unrest in the financial market, causing all parties to invest in spot goods. Pure gold, when it entered the market, was sold by Yingfenghang to silverware shops for 70 taels, with an additional 15 yuan. After entering, supply exceeded demand, and it immediately rose to 28 or 29 yuan. Yingfenghang and others continued to sell, and it fell again to an additional 26 yuan. At this time, silverware shops purchased about 600 to 700 taels. Tianjin goods were offered at an additional 20 yuan but were not traded. The future market was slightly flat and tired. Only 700 taels of Tianjin goods were sold by the Tianjin gang to Tongfenghang Tianjin goods, with an additional 18 yuan. In the end, the pattern was about an additional 17 yuan. As for the black market, the spot goods for the seven-month period were discounted by about 5 or 6 yuan by the multi-party.</p>
<p>In-market transactions were still active. Statistics show that Mao Hengchangyong, Huifengheng, Fuxingyong, Houchangyong, Yifengyong, Richang, Qianchangxiang, Yuanchang, and Yiyu were among the buyers. Yuanmaoyongheng, Yiyicheng, Shengda, Chunyuanyong, Tongtaichang, Renfayongheng, Xingfushengyong, and Yongde were among the sellers.

This was due to the smaller exchange market conditions. Immediately after opening, it was difficult to sell. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with the UK rising by 1.25 and the US rising by 1.875. Customs gold fell by one point. After opening, it was slightly firm. The Shanghai Bank took advantage of the low price to bid up spot forward orders, and although Yalei and Sassoon sold, they were still able to support the market. The HSBC Bank's listed prices were announced, with the UK rising by 1.25 and the US rising by 25, with little impact. Banks reacted by bidding to close, and the process became tighter. Sassoon also came to bid up the US exchange rate, but because banks took advantage of the high price to sell, there was still much struggle. Sassoon continued to bid up forward orders, and banks also maintained the level for the low-priced US exchange rate. The trend was still good at noon. The afternoon market was flat. Indian silver was reported at a low of 2 An'na, and although it was slightly tighter, the overall trend was still difficult to change drastically because banks took advantage of the high price to sell. The market hovered and was quite stable. Later, because Sassoon still had a buying appetite and Indian silver fell another six An'na for the second time, there was a slight tightening and Chinese merchants sold off some holdings. Finally, it was slightly loose. Until the close, the recent selling price for the near term was 1 shilling 7 pence 9375 and 8 pence to match, and the US exchange rate was 40 yuan 9375.

<h3>New York Stocks Rise More Than Fall</h3>

American canned goods, Continental canned food machinery, and telephone stocks all created new high records. Small exchange stocks were quite sluggish, but special unpopular stocks were very strong. The bond market was mixed and slightly rose. The total transaction volume for the day was 630,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower  Sichuan Merchants Actively Procuring Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the Hubei-Henan border remained firm. This was because the consecutive declines led to a stronger reaction, and the Sichuan merchants, who had been inactive for a long time, suddenly became active, with quite smooth purchases of 2,000 bales. The total transaction volume of merchant gangs for the day was over 3,000 bales, which greatly shocked people's hearts. Some even turned from short to long, and the market's rising power was stronger.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Rises Step by Step</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market in the previous market was relatively flat. The further months were auctioned at higher prices. In the 2.2 session, the rising trend was fierce, and short sellers massively covered their positions. Changfeng and Run Kang were the largest buyers. As a result, each month rose by 8 jiao to 1.34 jiao compared to the morning closing price. The opening of the afternoon market was tighter. It was heard that Sichuan procurement was even smoother, with 2,000 bales, and other gangs also had around 1,000 bales. At the same time, it was rumored that the financial situation might ease, so buying was particularly strong. In the 2.3 sessions, foreign firms came out to sell again, and the market price slightly returned. As a result, each month rose by 3.468 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 1,000 bales, Yuanda 1,800 bales, Hexing 800 bales, Taixing 700 bales, Yichang 1,600 bales, Xincheng 1,900 bales, Shenchang 1,500 bales, and Changfeng 2,500 bales. Tongji bought 1,150 bales, Daji 3,150 bales, Changfeng 2,050 bales, Run Kang 3,800 bales, Mingde 1,400 bales, Dachangcheng 4,650 bales, and Taichang 1,150 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Closing Price  Compared to Previous Day  Inventory Count</p>
<p>June  168.5  169.1  166.5  Up 1.10  18,200</p>
<p>July  169.9  167.0  168.9  1.40  37,600</p>
<p>August  170.7  168.6  170.3  1.90  47,650</p>
<p>September  171.7  169.6  171.2  1.80  33,950</p>
<p>October  172.1  170.4  171.6  1.60  35,300</p>
<p>November  172.5  170.5  172.0  1.80  19,950</p>
<p>Total  112,650</p>
<p>Spot Transactions Also Smooth</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were particularly smooth. It was found that the total amount purchased by various gangs throughout the day was 3,035 bales. The price rose by 5 jiao. The purchase amounts of various gangs are as follows:</p>
<p>Yunnan  300  Changsha  140  Guangdong  530</p>
<p>Haizhou  30  Xuzhou  10  Sichuan  2,000</p>
<p>Inland  15</p>
<h3>Cotton Follows Yarn Market Upward</h3>
<p>The cotton market remained strong because the yarn market rose, the bulls were active, and there were too many scattered shorts. Seeing that the environment was slightly better, more people covered their positions, so the market rose. However, there were many yarn factories that had stopped production, and there was no hope of starting work for a while, so there were still people selling when prices rose.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Sold Off When Prices Rose</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market in the previous market, the market atmosphere was still flat. Because foreign cotton fell by more than 10 pounds, it was auctioned in three sessions. As the yarn market rose, the actual wind also rose in the market. However, most of the psychology was that yarn factories stopped production, the demand for raw materials decreased, and there were still people selling when prices rose. The market atmosphere was slightly soft. As a result, each month rose by one jiao, two jiao, and three jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon market, it rose wildly with the yarn market. Later, there was some selling off, and it slightly returned. As a result, each month rose by 5 fen to 1.2 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Tongji sold 5,100 dan, Dafu 7,600 dan, Yuanda 4,300 dan, Suilong 1,400 dan, Zhenda 2,000 dan, Yichang 1,800 dan, and Yuanxingchang 2,100 dan. Run Kang bought 3,700 dan, Suilong 1,600 dan, Changji 2,200 dan, Sen Kang Sanji 100 dan, Changfeng 3,200 dan, Shengyuan 2,300 dan, Yuanyi 6,300 dan, and Taichang 3,200 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Cotton  Highest Price  Closing Price  Up or Down  Inventory Account</p>
<p>June  31.50  30.90  31.40  Up 0.50  99,400</p>
<p>July  31.90  31.60  31.80  0.30  168,600</p>
<p>August  31.95  31.55  31.75  0.25  194,500</p>

<p>November  31.95  31.65  31.80  0.25  60,100</p>
<p>Total  688,900</p>
<p>Not Much Cotton Arriving Either</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales remained flat. It is estimated that the Zhongxin Factory purchased the most. The source of goods was 120 bales of Yaohua cotton and 200 bales of Tonghua cotton.</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet  40.00  Yongan Factory Imported  300 pieces  Spot Goods Delivered to the Factory</p>
<p>Pengde Flower  42.00  Zhongxin Factory Imported  100 pieces  Again  Again</p>

<p>Fire Machine Flower  39.50  Yongan Factory Imported  500 bales  Again  Again</p>
<h3>American Cotton Falls Back More Than Ten Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the market situation was calm. Because the bulls closed out, and the Mumbai gang sold off, sales were not good, and each month fell by nine to twelve pounds. There were not many Southern sellers, and there were few transactions. Afterwards, colleagues bought in, and it slightly recovered. The production households' cotton storage reported that there were 818,000 bales of spot cotton and 675,000 bales of forward cotton. The staking cotton depot prepared to sell 350,000 bales of spot cotton later. The closing was flat. It is estimated that spot goods fell by an up pound sound, and forward goods fell by nine to fourteen pound sound. The British cotton market was closed. Indian cotton initially fell due to European exporters selling, but later it was firm due to people buying in. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 1-1.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 2-2.5 rupees, Bailuoxi fell by 1.25-1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (10th telegram).</p>

<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi flower in April-May on the 11th was 111 rupees, which was half a rupee lower than the previous closing.</p>
<h3>Cotton Exports from Cocanada</h3>
<p>A telegram from Bombay on the 10th states that last week, Cocanada exported a total of 1,906 bales of cotton, of which 238 bales went to Hamburg, 1,478 bales to Kobe, and 100 bales to Liverpool.</p>
<h3>Accumulated Cotton Yarn Reaches a Huge Number</h3>
<p>An increase of over 7,000 bales compared to the end of April.</p>
<p>According to a survey by a foreign firm, the stock of Chinese and Japanese cotton yarn in Shanghai at the end of May totaled 70,831 bales, an increase of 7,140 bales compared to the end of April. Japanese yarn accounted for 12,842 bales, an increase of 4,117 bales compared to the end of April, while Chinese yarn accounted for 57,950 bales, an increase of 1,014 bales compared to the end of April. The reason for the increase is said to be the impact of recent financial instability. The stock quantities of Chinese and Japanese yarn, categorized by counts, are listed below:</p>
<p>Chinese Yarn</p>

<h3>Grains: New Wheat Has Opened for Trading Everywhere; Canada Plans to Abolish the Grain Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was calm and stable for all months. When the market opened, foreign wheat was slightly better, and most parties were watching and waiting, and trading was not smooth, but the market remained stable, two or three fen higher than the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon, there were few trades in July, but the trades in August and September were very active. Initially, prices were high and sentiment was stable, but later, long positions were unwound and clients took profits, causing a slight pullback. As arrivals gradually increase, the July market may need to fall slightly. The result was that July was still up two fen, August was unchanged, September was down a little over one fen, and October was unchanged. The spot wheat market remained stable, as arrivals continued, with 5,000 to 6,000 bags arriving daily by ship and train. Mills were intentionally watching and waiting, so it was difficult to raise prices. Wheat from Kai Guan Dian, Chuzhou, and Shaheji was priced at 3.42 yuan, wheat from Yangzhou, Taiping, and Hezhou Puzhen was priced at 3.25 yuan, wheat from Anding Wusong was priced at 3.80 yuan, wheat from Kunshan was priced at 3.26 yuan, wheat from Penglai was priced at 3.10 yuan, wheat from Tangshi was priced at 3.33-3.34 yuan, and wheat from Lujiabang was priced at 3.20 yuan. Xinda took 1,000 bags, Fufeng took 1,500 bags, and Fuxin took 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>U.S. wheat rumors state that the Canadian government will abolish the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. Demand is very weak. Last week, the available supply decreased by 2.51 million bushels. The government estimates winter wheat production at 44.1 million bushels, and the condition of spring wheat is 85.2%, which are all bullish signals.</p>

<h3>Flour Futures Buying Remains Strong</h3>
<p>The flour market continued to rise yesterday, with foreign wheat quoted at around 4 to 12 jiao higher for Chicago, and 4 jiao plus for Canadian. When the market opened, foreign wheat was only slightly better, and sentiment should have been flat, but due to good sentiment outside the industry, customer assistance activities rose up to replenish positions. Futures saw large-scale buying from outsiders, and prices rose sharply, two or three fen higher than the closing price of the previous day. Later, buying eased slightly, and the mills slightly weakened, but the competition between various plates was very fierce, and more than 500,000 bags were traded. In the afternoon, because the wheat market was peaceful, sentiment was flat and tired, but then the bulls entered again, and there was a rebound. However, trading has cleared, and only over 200,000 bags were traded. Given the current situation, such a market may be able to stabilize. As a result, the current month continued to be up 2 fen and 2.5 li, July was up 2 fen, August was up 1 fen and 7.5 li, September was up 1 fen and 2.5 li, October was up 1 fen and 2.5 li, and November was up 1 fen and 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Rice Arrivals are Scarcer and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of rice from various states in South Shanghai were particularly scarce, with only 1,700 to 1,800 shi arriving (cargo No. 7-8). The sales floor was also dull, with only the Qingdao gang taking 300 bags. Prices increased, but market sentiment seemed unstable. Prices for various thick japonica and middle-market late rice increased by several fen or jiao. High-quality thin indica rice was expensive, and sales were relatively slow, with little activity. Supply and demand for varieties such as Yinbian Yuan and Dujian were similar, with no changes. Yesterday in North Shanghai, sixteen to seventeen cargo ships arrived from various routes along the river. Each cargo on the market sold, white japonica turned dull, thin indica was average, and the remaining cargoes continued to move. Market prices for white japonica slightly softened, thin indica stabilized, white yuan remained firm, and other varieties saw little change.</p>
<p>Foreign rice sales remained active. In addition to various gangs from inland Zhejiang Province continuing to ship goods, the Nanjing gang saw a sudden surge in sales. Gangs from Xunqing and Zhenjiang in the Yangtze River region also inquired. The market continued to expand. If sales continue to be strong today and tomorrow, prices may need to increase further. Yesterday, Saigon No. 1 and small-grain rice rose by 1 jiao, while No. 3 rice and broken rice remained relatively stable. A total of 15,000 bags of various Saigon rices, 7,000 bags of small-grain rice, over 2,000 bags of various Siam Gao Gong rices, and 500 bags of customer indica were sold throughout the day, distributed to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the local street.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Sales Active Due to Rain in the Countryside</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for soybean cake saw increased activity, due to cloudy weather and the possibility of rain in the countryside, giving hope for rice transplanting and farming. As a result, prices rose by two to three fen in both the morning and afternoon. A total of 16,000 to 17,000 pieces of cake were traded (see the market price column for prices). Soybean sales were still not weak, with a total of eighteen to nineteen truckloads of beans sold across the market, but market conditions remained generally flat and tired, mainly due to pressure from Shandong soybeans (yesterday, it was heard that fifty truckloads of Sipingjie beans were traded at a price of only 3.5 yuan), so the market was unable to rally.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: New Bamboo Branches for Cocoons Urgently Need Improvement</h3>
<p>The cocoon bamboo branches produced in Zhangzhou have good seedlings this year, and the estimated harvest is expected to be 60-70%. According to a letter, new products can be seen at the end of this month. Due to news of a poor harvest of Jinshan branches produced in Guangdong, merchants there have raised prices. However, given the current financial situation, sales may be difficult at that time. Moreover, the quality of the goods is inferior to Guangdong products, and improvement is essential. If the lychees are pointed, without flesh, and inedible, they are also useless and should be removed to stimulate sales. This year, as the Jinshan branches are in short supply, it is imperative to take the opportunity to improve the products in order to expand sales.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Prices Differ by Only a Few Yuan</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday was Easter, and Western merchants at home and abroad were closed for business, so the silk market was even more deserted. In recent days, many silk telegrams have been sent from Shanghai to foreign countries, but few have received responses. It is said that the difference in prices between the two sides is only about twenty yuan. However, due to extremely erratic exchange rates, it is difficult to conclude transactions. If gold prices can stabilize slightly, it should not be difficult to break the deadlock of protective mutual observation.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Zhuangzhenmei green tea was slightly dull. The prices of goods from Suian, Tunxi, Wenzhou, and other routes resumed their downward trend. The average price of pumped-core ordinary Zhenmei fell by three to four yuan compared to the previous day. The sales of green tea from Pingshui and Tuzhuang were even more sluggish. Six to seven-tenths of the raw tea from various counties in Zhejiang Province is still held by tea farmers, with no one buying it.</p>

<h3>"Rotten" or "Rampant"?</h3>
<p>—Juan</p>
<p>An article in the April issue of "Literature" aroused Mr. Wu Ai's feelings of "rottenness and rampantness" regarding Westernized literary styles and vocabulary. Taking the opportunity to vent his views, even "mechanism," "contradiction," and "trend" were frowned upon. Mr. Wu Ai then quoted a passage from the Englishman Locke to prove the ridiculousness of people who use such words. In fact, Locke did not say that these words should never be used, but only that they should be used appropriately and appropriately. "Mechanism," "contradiction," and "trend" each have its own special meaning, and there is nothing ridiculous about using them. As long as "the throbbing heartstrings" and "the net of sorrow" are expressed appropriately, it is not a problem if one does not say "Oh, my heartstrings are throbbing!" as soon as one opens one's mouth. The problem with Tianji's joke, "Women burden me like a tumor, children are born like rain, and the tragedy of the petit bourgeoisie is gradually touching us...," is not that it is "too artificial" or "suffers from deliberately writing," but that "a metaphor is inappropriate and the intention is not clear," and it has nothing to do with Westernized literary styles. A child's "being born" will certainly not be "like rain," but the sentence "the tragedy of the petit bourgeoisie is gradually touching us" has no grammatical objection.</p>
<p>I believe that the reason why "the works of many people are filled with words such as "mechanism," "contradiction," and "trend"" is definitely not due to "competing to show off novelty" or "posing coquettishly," let alone because they are "simple in thought" and "afraid that others will think their articles are superficial, so they stubbornly work on the words and sentences to make others find it difficult to understand," nor is it because they "have nothing to say but insist on saying it, so they pinch their throats and pretend," but because the author lacks a more appropriate and more common way of expression, so they have to pick up these words, which make the middle-aged friends who are used to reading thread-bound books have headaches.</p>
<p>Writing in a way that is easy to understand is the right thing to do. But if you can't get more simple and appropriate words, then let's use "mechanism," "contradiction," "trend," "superstructure," and "infrastructure," although they are "difficult to understand," but they are not "unintelligible." "A physically fit woman is also very charming in simple clothes and a cloth skirt," that's right. But if even a "cloth skirt" that is "unique in style" is not available, then just grab some ready-made things (even "foreign goods" are not impossible) to wear. As long as they fit, even if they look "uncomfortable" or "more and more uncomfortable," and even lose the "interest," it is okay, because this can only be blamed on those who watch it being too fond of "comfort" and too fond of the "simple clothes and cloth skirt" that are "unique in style," and have developed a habit, so they feel a little glaring at foreign decorations at a glance.</p>
<p>Didn't Grandmaster Lin feel the entanglement of the "bottom line" and the necessity of advocating quotations because the vernacular used "bottom line" at the same time? I think it is better to continue with the "bottom line." In this regard, my views are somewhat different from Mr. Wu Ai.</p>
<h3>Looking at Lianran Painting "Bridge" Notes</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>I went back to the countryside for the summer last year, which was when the country people were bitterly complaining about the day being dry and the land scorched. The relatively clean water was stored in urns like precious money. Teahouses closed. Drinking tea was restricted. After the washing water was used, it was assigned for washing vegetables or laundry. The river had long been dry. When the peasants running to the lakeside said, "The lake has dried down five or six miles away," there was only a startled bitter smile on people's faces.</p>
<p>At that time, I decided to go down to the lake to take a look. To some extent, I wanted to collect some materials to describe the suffering of the peasants.</p>
<p>I invited my friend Gu Lianran, who likes calligraphy, to go with me.</p>
<p>However, just as our plan was about to be realized, it was immediately dispelled. Many friends advised us not to go. At that time, the peasants had become crazy because of despair. It was easy for us to go there to provoke their anger. They could not tolerate our neat clothes, clean hands, and faces that were not sweating and sun-scorched. They could not tolerate our leisurely attitude and casual mood! "Hey! We are struggling on the line of death, but you are here to watch!" If we were them, we would think so too.</p>
<p>However, a major drought like this is rare to see in my hometown, which is located on the shores of the great Taihu Lake, and has complex waterways. We wanted to leave this painful impression behind as a souvenir. Lianran was determined to paint a picture of the drought. In the end, we found the subject matter almost in the place where we were talking, - the bridges in our small town. At that time, we were surprised when we realized that what we were standing on was the wonderful subject matter we had been looking for for so long! Ah! How many good materials are right in front of us, but are ignored by writers!</p>
<p>We walked to the stone river pier facing the arch of the bridge and squatted down to take a look. The familiar stone bridge had become so strange. It was so high that it was a bit frightening. Because the lower half, which was usually submerged in water, was now completely exposed. The yellow mud riverbed, which originally had only a few green, stinky ponds that had not been sucked dry by the sun, had now increased by more than ten zhang-deep, well-like pools. By separating the mud with straw mats, murky yellow water seeped out. We all thanked the smart people who came up with this idea! Sometimes small smarts can save many people.</p>
<p>People not only fetched water in the riverbed, but many people who walked across the street also no longer relied on this big bridge. A woman secretly released two ducks into the pool to let them swim, but when the two ducks were happily quacking, she immediately picked up the ducks and left, like a frightened mouse.</p>
<p>Lianran spent four or five days painting that bridge. Look at him using yellow, gray, and blue colors. The yellow is the riverbed, and the gray is full of heavy brushstrokes and emotions.</p>
<p>When Lianran was painting, there were usually many townspeople surrounding him to watch every day. On the day he was about to finish painting, it was also the day when the most people were crowding around him. A countryman squeezed in. When he squeezed in and saw what was going on, he immediately squeezed out in disappointment, muttering:</p>
<p>"I thought there was a Western scene to see! It turned out to be like that, some kind of trickery! Can this thing be eaten? Is it worth gathering so many people to watch!"</p>
<p>His words were certainly reckless, but they represented the words of many country farmers! It included a lot of goals and truths for writers. What they need now is "eating." And not anything else. At the same time, I also thought that what we wrote, no matter how proletarian we think it is, is still very, very far away from their lives and needs. Therefore, everyone is the same, first fill your stomach, and then you can fill your brain.</p>
<h3>Nagging</h3>
<p>— Changmin</p>
<p>—Written in dialect</p>
<p>You fellow really don't know what's good for you,</p>
<p>A string of words that can't be chewed,</p>
<p>As smelly and long as Wang Mama's foot wraps.</p>
<p>A frog jumps in an oil lamp,</p>
<p>The cowhide roars, blowing up a storm.</p>
<p>I see you're really incorrigibly poor,</p>
<p>Eating porridge and pouring in vegetable soup!</p>
<p>Quickly shut your big mouth,</p>
<p>Lest the mirror reflect the face of a twisted-mouth shrew.</p>
<p>I say these days are like rats biting cow horns,</p>
<p>The tighter the bite, the less hope.</p>
<p>Last year, the weather was good and the crops were abundant,</p>
<p>Hoping to fill the stomachs of the whole family;</p>
<p>Who knew that the sky would have unpredictable storms, and disaster would come out of nowhere,</p>
<p>Everyone was happy like sparrows in coarse chaff.</p>
<p>Alas, we are all turtledoves in the bamboo forest,</p>
<p>Not knowing spring and autumn, not understanding the situation;</p>
<p>Well, like dogs biting mosquitoes, we can only let life collide with fate!</p>
<h3>University Days (I)</h3>
<p>— By German writer Storm, translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>Nali</p>
<p>I didn't have a sister, so no one introduced me to girls of the same age to make friends. But I went to dance lessons. Dance lessons were twice a week, and the location was at the city government ten; the city hall was also the city's residential area. The mayor's son was my Bingming; they together had eight, Guo jump without, city level, students full in the car. However, when it came to five dance partners, a door problem that was difficult to solve initially arose: an eighth female dance partner of equal status could not be found.</p>
<p>But the mayor's son, Fritz, had a solution. There was a woman who used to work as a mother at his home, and the mayor still asks her to help when there are banquets. She married a tailor who tailored old clothes, a skinny, yellow-faced man with a French surname who liked to talk big in the hotel more than to pick up a needle and thread and work at the tailor's desk. This family lives on those streets at the end of the city facing the palace park. That little tree, that ten-tree dam is similar to them. The door of this tree almost completely blocks the only window. We often pass by in front of that house, wanting to take a glimpse of that lovely little girl: she often likes to sit behind a few pots of sweet osmanthus and canary grass and sew things, and she actually occupies a very important place in our childhood fantasies.</p>
<p>She is the only child of a French tailor, a beautiful thirteen-year-old girl, and although the clothes she wears are made of ordinary materials, her mother keeps her very clean. Her light brown skin and dark eyes indicate that her father is of foreign descent. I still remember that she combs her black hair very low, all the way to the side of her temples, which makes her originally small face even more charming.</p>
<h3>No Father</h3>
<p>— Chen Fuxi</p>
<p>Qiu'er has no father.</p>
<p>Father is dead. But Qiu'er doesn't know what death is. When his father died, he saw his mother crying, his sister crying, so he cried too. He didn't know why he was crying, he just felt that crying was fun. Usually, if he woke up and didn't see his mother, he would cry; if he saw something he wanted to eat but didn't buy it, he would also cry; or if the children next door beat him, he would also cry; and when he cried, tears would flow down his face, as if he had unspeakable suffering. When his father died, Qiu'er didn't shed tears, he just learned to wail like his mother, and after wailing a few times, he laughed.</p>
<p>"Mom, Dad is sleeping, Dad..."</p>
<p>He twisted his mother's clothes and said. But his mother ignored him and just kept crying. Qiu'er found it strange: why was Mom always crying at Dad? He was a five-year-old child, who could just run and talk, and didn't understand anything. Someone put mourning clothes on him, that white linen clothes, white shoes, white hat, which made Qiu'er even more puzzled: he saw his mother, sister, and brother, all wearing white. He thought in his little belly: wearing white clothes probably meant going to the streets to play; because in the past, whenever Mom and Dad took him to see a play, they would always change into new clothes. Therefore, after he put on the mourning clothes, he could hardly stand still, fearing that Mom and sister wouldn't go with him, and murmured:</p>
<p>"Let's go see, go to the streets..." No one paid attention to him as he made such a fuss. Qiu'er was really pitiful, he didn't understand anything. When he slowly grew up, he never saw his biological father. In his mind, he never knew that he had a father. One sunny afternoon, Qiu'er ran to the neighbor's house to play and saw that A Mao had a white rubber dog, chocolate candy, and a brand new, fun toy car. As long as you wound the spring, the car would start on the smooth ground. Qiu'er was very happy to see this toy car and couldn't wait to take it back from A Mao's house immediately. What he usually saw were huge cars, but Qiu'er had never seen such a delicate, novel toy car before. Now that he saw it suddenly, he felt frustrated because he loved it but couldn't get it. He really wanted to have one himself. He wanted to ask A Mao for it, but he couldn't bring himself to ask, knowing that A Mao would definitely not give it away. He thought it would be nice to borrow it to play with, so he mumbled a request to A Mao:</p>
<p>"Can you let me play with this toy car?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>Having received A Mao's permission, Qiu'er took it in his hand and wound the spring. Before long, the car really started on the smooth cement floor. Qiu'er was envious and played with it again and again. Finally, he asked:</p>
<p>"A Mao, who bought this for you?"</p>
<p>"My dad."</p>
<p>"Dad?"</p>
<p>Hearing the two words "Dad", Qiu'er was stunned. He thought to himself: why don't I have a dad? Where is my dad? Why doesn't he buy me a toy car? Qiu'er knew A Mao's dad. He was a man who wore glasses and Western clothes, and who often hugged A Mao and kissed him, but he didn't understand why he didn't have a dad.</p>
<p>He went home with a melancholy mood.</p>
<p>"Mom, do I have a dad?" Qiu'er asked.</p>
<p>"Of course you do!"</p>
<p>"Then where is my dad?"</p>
<p>"You'll know when you grow up."</p>
<p>Qiu'er was at a loss. During the Cold Food Festival, the family went to the countryside to sweep the tombs. Mom pointed to a green tomb that looked like a steamed bun and said:</p>
<p>"Your dad is inside here..."</p>
<p>He seemed to understand a little, but he didn't understand clearly. He still didn't understand what death was, and thought that his dad would come home one day, so the next day, when he met A Mao, he said to A Mao:</p>
<p>"I have a dad too."</p>
<p>Saying that, Qiu'er laughed happily. It was as if his dad was also going to buy him a brand new, delicate toy car.</p>
<h3>White Spirit Temple (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yuan Chenying</p>
<p>Behind the Mongolian yurt stood the "Obo" mountain, with several people gazing into the distance. I slowly walked up, powerless. The mountain wasn't high. Looking ahead from the Obo: It was a vast, flat grassland. A cold wind blew from the north, and large patches of white clouds floated in the blue sky. Looking at the boundless land ahead, I suddenly thought that if a large troop of Mongolian soldiers on Mongolian horses were galloping across it, the scene would certainly be heroic and martial.</p>
<p>After descending the hillside, our boys had all gone to the temple fair, leaving me alone and forlorn in the yurt. A feeling of desolation and loneliness suddenly overwhelmed me. I walked out of the yurt, passed through the rows of yurts, and headed east towards the river.</p>
<p>Emerging from beside the yurts piled high with cow dung (Note 2), the air was still. Only a few pedestrians crossed the single-plank bridge. When I passed by, they merely glanced at me and then walked towards the yurts, speaking Mongolian that I couldn't understand.</p>
<p>Across the river were some earthen houses at the foot of the mountain, about twenty or so. Walking through an alleyway piled with garbage, a dog lay there quietly. Around the bend was a newly opened restaurant. The sound of stir-frying came from inside. A red paper sign on the window read: "No Credit." Wanting to drink something, I walked in, unexpectedly hearing a familiar voice:</p>
<p>"Hey! When did you get here?"</p>
<p>I looked up in surprise at the kang (Note 3) and saw Mr. H, whom I knew from Guihua City, greeting me.</p>
<p>"I arrived yesterday! What a coincidence, meeting you here." I said, sitting on the kang, as if meeting a relative in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Mr. H poured me a cup of tea. I asked him when he had arrived and what he was doing here. He lowered his head and quietly told me that he had been here for four or five days, trying to find a job. He hadn't expected that there were so many people here already, too many! There was no way to find a position, and he would probably have to go back… Then he sighed and said, "Too many people, not enough jobs," it's like that everywhere! Even this Mongolian place has unemployment. These earthen houses are full of officials from the Mongolian Political Council and people who came here hoping to find a job at the Mongolian Political Council!</p>
<p>After eating a few sentences, Mr. H and I walked out of the restaurant. He pointed me to the post office and bid me farewell. I walked into the post office alone.</p>
<p>The post office was in an earthen house without a courtyard wall. The stove was burning brightly, and a clerk was preparing to cook. I talked with the postmaster and learned that letters were delivered by horse courier, three times a month. He was from Beiping and said that life here was very hard. No matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter, there were no vegetables to eat. Only the postman occasionally brought some vegetables from the city… He only stopped talking when I said goodbye.</p>
<p>Walking out of the post office, thinking about Mr. H's words and the postmaster's complaints, I couldn't help but feel lost in this Mongolian land.</p>
<p>Note 1: "Camel hair quilt" is made of camel hair, filled with camel hair, extremely warm, and used by the people of Suiyuan to keep warm.</p>
<p>Note 2: The cow dung piled in front of the Mongolian yurt is used by the Mongolians for cooking fires.</p>
<p>Note 3: "Kang" In the north, earthen kangs are used as beds. "Kang shang" means on the bed, as southerners would say.</p>

<p>Conversations</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Preventing Suicide</h3>
<p>— Hen</p>
<p>In recent years, the trend of suicide has been increasing daily. According to statistics from this city for the past year, one person commits suicide every four hours. The alarming number is already an obstacle to the nation's future. Recently, it has become even more severe, with entire families committing suicide together, the tragic harm of which threatens to destroy the nation. Discussing methods of prevention is truly the most urgent and pressing task at hand. Reading Director Wu's opinion on preventing suicide, the argument is concise and essential, and the benevolent words are widely beneficial, worthy of being called a good medicine for saving the times. I will add some supplements to Director Wu's three points, as a small contribution.</p>
<p>Regarding psychological transformation, in addition to Director Wu's point that newspapers and films should do their best to avoid sensationalizing suicides and refrain from sympathy, more emphasis should be placed on educational enlightenment, establishing a common goal. Citizens are the essential elements of a national organization. Destroying oneself is destroying the nation. Encourage their will to strive upward and the true value of life. At this time of promoting literacy education, the opportunity can be used to attack the evils of suicide, providing a strong remedy for the general uneducated population. Furthermore, in various supplementary schools and women's schools, instill students with a spirit of struggle. In ordinary primary and secondary schools, emphasis should be placed on production education and vocational skills, breaking the misconception of simply burying oneself in books, in order to cope with the current economic difficulties.</p>
<p>Regarding substantial assistance, this city only has one municipal poor people's loan office to help the common people, which is far too few. It is truly necessary to expand the organization and establish branch offices in different districts. At the same time, improve the small loan methods of the banking sector. Because nowadays, if common people have urgent needs and go to the bank for loans, there are many difficulties. Even if the loan is successfully obtained, they have already tasted countless hardships. I believe that bank loans, in order to guarantee property rights, only need to investigate whether the borrower has a skill and whether there is a guarantor, and the transaction can be completed. There should be no intentional delays to cause embarrassment. Therefore, the level of substantial assistance should require banks to improve their methods and expand the poor people's loan capital, so as to facilitate turnover.</p>
<p>Regarding improving relief efforts, according to the situation in this city, people tend to focus on the dead and neglect the living. Even if it cannot be said that personal connections are used in charitable affairs, the fact that the truly poor cannot obtain benefits is indeed a fact. For the sake of the present, the authorities should pay attention to various charitable organizations, strictly supervise them, and transform charitable organizations that distribute benefits into profit-generating organizations. The method is to start with investigation, with the authorities appointing people to improve the content of all public and private charitable organizations by districts, making them industrialized groups. All applicants for relief should be required to enter the organization to learn crafts, using their earned wages to support their lives. If there is a surplus, half goes to the public and half goes to private ownership, so that the unemployed have jobs and the lazy are motivated, as a large-scale reform to eliminate the previous organizations that were solely for distributing benefits and encouraging dependence. (With compliments)</p>
<h3>Lamp</h3>
<p>— Tan Tan</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting hotter. At night, although there is some wind, everything in the room has been baked hot by the sun all day. Therefore, the time I fall asleep at night has to be delayed day by day. Recently, I don't even dare to turn on the electric light much, because its heat, although not very high, gives me a considerable sense of annoyance in my senses with its incandescent light.</p>
<p>Regarding lamps, I actually like them very much. If someone asked me, "What do you like most in the world?" then I would definitely answer without hesitation, "I like lamps the most."</p>
<p>I don't know what I felt when I first saw a lamp after being born from my mother's body. I guess I was surprised by everything at that time, so I wouldn't pay special attention to the lamp. But after I had memories, the lamp gave me a good impression, which is very clear.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was when I was six or seven years old, I didn't sleep in the same bed with my mother anymore. In winter, the night is very long, and I go to bed early, so I often wake up at one or two o'clock. That was when my mother and the others had been asleep for a long time and were sleeping soundly. Although I called out in a tender voice, they couldn't hear me much. At this time, I felt terrified. It was as if everyone in the family had run away, leaving only me. Just as I was about to cry, I saw an oil lamp on a small table in front of my bed through the printed cotton mosquito net. At that time, the wick had been turned down very low, and it wasn't glaring even when looking closely. I immediately felt warmth and peace of mind, like finding a relative, and fell asleep again. Even now, the scene at that time is still vividly in my mind, especially the layer of haze on the transparent lampshade due to the kerosene fumes!</p>
<p>When I was fifteen or sixteen years old, I had already developed a very natural habit of reading at night. For a better book, it was common to read until three or four in the morning. Because I read at night, my father specially bought me a kerosene lamp with a white lampshade. It was taller and larger than ordinary kerosene lamps. The wick of ordinary kerosene lamps is a tongue-shaped strip, while this one is a circular shape; therefore, its light is two or three times stronger than that of ordinary oil lamps. At that time, I had no experience of reading under electric lights, so when I lit it, I felt that the whole room was bright and my eyes were clear and my heart was happy. Especially interesting was that this kind of lamp also had a frame made of thick lead wire or something similar, and there was also a small brass hook on the frame. When lit at night, I could boil water on the lamp to brew tea, or warm up some cooked lotus seeds and lilies. I didn't really want to eat anything at night,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>but I really wanted to drink good tea, so the brass hook often made pleasant sounds on the lamp frame. What made me especially happy was that on several snowy nights, after I finished reading a volume of books, I carried the small hook outside to the water tank to fetch water. When I got closer, I saw that the water in the tank had frozen into ice, and a layer of snow had been added on top of the ice. I didn't hesitate to use the lead spoon that always left water, put the snow on the ice in the brass hook, and boiled it on the lamp. When it boiled, I brewed it and drank it, and it tasted several times better than usual.</p>
<p>The Lantern Festival is the Lantern Festival, but in our hometown, the lanterns are hung up from New Year's Eve. One year, also because of my special love for lamps, I hung twenty-four red gauze lanterns on the corridors on all sides of the 口-shaped house in my home. At the same time, six pairs of candles with bright horn covers were burned in the inner hall. At that time, the adults were all preparing the necessary things for the New Year in the house, and I was the only one who was responsible for guarding the middle of the courtyard. Although the house was not magnificent, I felt that it was quite luxurious.</p>
<p>Speaking of red gauze lanterns, I remembered another thing. That year, it was my relative's sister's wedding, and I was ordered to attend the wedding banquet. I have never liked drinking the wine of women, because as soon as the bridal sedan chair leaves, it seems unbearably lonely. This time, there was no way, I had to go. At the same time, the person getting married was also very close to me. Under these circumstances, I naturally had no choice but to drink with my throat. Sure enough, it wasn't long before I was so drunk that I couldn't stand up straight.</p>
<p>When the relatives saw that I was drunk, they called two servants to help me home. My house and my relatives' house were separated by a rather deserted street, with few street lights. All the lanterns in their house had been taken out for serious business. They had no choice but to take off a hanging red gauze lantern and hand it to a smaller servant. I leaned on the shoulder of the larger servant, and a red gauze lantern led the way, slowly returning home. At that time, the long street was deserted, and the crescent moon was beautiful. Although I was drunk, I felt inexplicably happy. All the way, I murmured the two sentences "The sound of pipes and flutes returns to the courtyard, the lights go down the tower." In fact, the ten-tune music of the relatives' family was coming in waves!</p>
<h3>Flood</h3>
<p>— Xiaoyun</p>
<p>"This annoying weather, always drizzling rain, it's really going to kill us poor people! ... Alas, in this kind of weather, who would want to eat cold noodles?" Old Zhang Fa got up early in the morning, looked at the gray sky in the courtyard, and the thin, long raindrops like cold noodle money in front of the eaves. His chest felt as if it had been pierced by a poisonous arrow, and he muttered to himself in secret.</p>
<p>Old Zhang Fa was an old man about fifty or sixty years old, with a bald head, a hunched back, dark skin, and many deep wrinkles deeply imprinted on his forehead, like the rings of a tree, recording the hardships of his life. Every year, in addition to planting more than a dozen acres of dry land at the entrance of the village to barely maintain the family's food, after the work in the fields was finished, if he could get a little free time, he and his son would do seasonal small businesses, earning a little profit to help the family's expenses. For example, now it is the hot month of May, so he makes cold noodles, carrying the burden, selling them back and forth in the village.</p>
<p>"Dad - Dad - the situation out ... side ... side is really a bit bad! This morning I passed by the stream in front of the village, and the water rose so fast that it was almost overflowing the embankment, and it was as turbid as mud!" His eldest son, A Gen, came in from the outside carrying a burden, his clothes all soaked by the rain, and strings of water droplets dripped from under the hem of his pants. Panting, he said that there was no business at all today, and he walked through two villages without earning a cent! Just now he passed by Uncle Zhi Xiang's door, and Uncle Zhi Xiang was urging his son to move the goods in the store, he said: "This time the stream water is rising very badly, and it is so rapid, it has not been seen in more than ten years. I think the mountain torrents above are not small!" Dad, I think, this time we can't avoid a flood!" His son, A Gen, said as he carried the burden under the window by the door.</p>
<p>Old Zhang Fa unconsciously raised his head to look at the sky outside the window, sighed a long breath, lowered his head, and sat back on the edge of the bed, silently smoking his dry tobacco.</p>
<p>"Dad, our place is also low-lying, we should prepare first, otherwise, when the flood comes, there won't be enough time to move the things in the house." He began to pull out the broken wooden box with a missing ear from under the bed.</p>
<p>Old Zhang Fa was still silent and did not say a word, his head lower than before. He thought of the dozen acres of dry land at the entrance of the village, the dry land bearing fat rice! He kept imagining that after the flood, wouldn't the rice fields be ruined by the flood? At that time, the autumn harvest would be hopeless, so where would the family's food and clothing be raised? Thinking of this, it seemed that a grimacing demon was standing in front of him, stretching out its furry giant arm, groping for his head. He was so frightened that goosebumps appeared all over his body, and he dared not imagine it any further.</p>
<p>"Alas! Since Heaven doesn't want to keep people alive, there's no place to escape to even if we run!" Old Zhang Fa hummed in a drawn-out voice.</p>
<p>The rain in the courtyard was getting heavier and heavier, and the rainwater in front of the eaves was flowing淙淙潺潺.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gong sound came from the village, along with a noisy and chaotic sound.</p>
<p>"Everyone come out to help guard the embankment, the embankment is about to collapse!"</p>
<p>Not long after this sound passed, there was a loud "哗..." sound from outside the village, clearly the embankment had been breached by the stream torrent.</p>
<p>"Run for your life! ... Run for your life quickly!" A mournful cry came in!</p>
<p>"Dad, let's run, let's run quickly! If we're late..." His son hurried over to help his father.</p>
<p>"Child, where can we run to? ..."</p>
<h3>Love and Desire</h3>
<p>— Xinlu</p>
<p>It is the season when peonies are in bloom.</p>
<p>Stepping into the imperial garden, Dong Xiaowan's heart kept pounding. She lowered her head, only caring about shrinking into her chest; her eyes were on the ground, almost closing her eyelids in fear. The faint sweat that seeped out of her forehead made her suspect that she was rolling around in a steamer.</p>
<p>On the one hand, she was concerned that her husband, Mao Pijiang, who had sneaked into the palace disguised as a eunuch, would be discovered by the Yongzheng Emperor if he stayed here for too long; on the other hand, she felt an undeniable sense of guilt and shame. Wasn't it the case? She had originally agreed with him to elope on Qingming Festival, but now? The Dragon Boat Festival had also passed long ago, but she was still attached to the deep palace. The secret words of vows made in the past had all turned into empty bubbles. Although the palace guards were strict, making it difficult to act for a while, her own lack of courage, her refusal to tear down the fortress of love between her and the Yongzheng Emperor, her determination to fly out of his arms, was ultimately an ironclad fact. This made her conscience suffer severe condemnation, and her nerves twitched with pain, as if a frightened bird's iron claws were hooking her soul.</p>
<p>"Heavens! If you don't save me again, I will be tormented to death by this contradictory life!" She sighed softly, comfortably stretching her right wrist out of the Yongzheng Emperor's embrace, and slightly raised her eyes to look over, already seeing her husband, Mao Pijiang, kneeling to welcome her in front of the Nine Dragon Pavilion.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Xiaowan!"</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, I feel that life is ultimately just a short tragedy. When the source of life has spilled the last drop, who can avoid shaking hands and turning into dust; the passion, love, and desire of life all return to the void in fragments. How can it not make people feel frustrated!"</p>
<p>"Ah, Xiaowan, why are you always so sentimental? Your distress also causes me endless pain; people are just people after all! Xiaowan, please don't think wildly anymore! Look at how luxuriantly the peonies are blooming, let's have three drinks." The Yongzheng Emperor clung tightly</p>
<p>nestled up to her, with a slight moistness in his eyes, and truly loved her, giving her boundless sympathy and tenderness; she was so grateful that she was almost crying.</p>
<p>The sound of light footsteps startled the little sparrows in the trees, and they chirped and flew away, and the entire space fell into a deathly silence.</p>
<p>Entering the Nine Dragon Pavilion, the banquet had already been set. Mao Pijiang stood respectfully by the side, serving; his face was even thinner than before. Dong Xiaowan felt great pity in her heart, thinking that he was originally a scholarly gentleman who was accustomed to being pampered, but because he was unwilling to have his wife taken away, he had traveled and struggled and suffered all the pain in the world. Now I am enjoying myself and drinking wine above, but he is flattering at the bottom of the steps, which can't help but make her feel a strong burst of bitterness:</p>
<p>"Ah"!</p>
<p>"Ah"!</p>
<p>Golden Leaf Phoenix Tail Wine,</p>
<p>Crabapple Jade Cup,</p>
<p>Zhilan Fish,</p>
<p>Dragon Liver Meat,</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Objects were shaking in front of her, one ten, a thousand… She威到 her head was strangely light, the sky seemed to be collapsing, she looked at Yongzheng, looked at Mao Pijiang, their faces were all terribly stupid, a dreamlike illusion expanded, big, big… as big as a cloud felt, holding her straight up, she seemed to be walking on the wind in the air, and in a flash she fell into the peony flower bushes, the crimson color made her feel the fear of her future destiny, and it seemed that Yongzheng's face became hideous and terrifying, gradually he opened his bloody mouth and wanted to devour her. She hurriedly ran to Mao Pijiang for help, but unexpectedly, Mao Pijiang also held a steel knife and rushed at her fiercely from the opposite side. She fled to the side for her life. Suddenly, the sky was dark and the earth was dark, and countless black shadows stopped her way, just as she was about to be killed, the steel knife had already struck straight down from behind, and she cried and fell down with a wail.</p>
<p>"Wake up"!</p>
<p>"Wake up"!</p>
<p>The sunlight suddenly dimmed, the sky was so gloomy that it made people</p>
<p>shiver, the bees were buzzing, and the peonies seemed to</p>
<p>became dark purple.</p>
<h3>Mangzhong (Grain in Ear)</h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>"In the countryside, there are few idle people in April, as they have just finished sericulture and are preparing the paddy fields"; in the countryside, April in the lunar calendar is simply the busiest season for farmers, and at the same time, it is also the most hopeful and precious season. At this time, regardless of men, women, and children, everyone has their work to do: especially in the rural areas of Jiangnan, after the tea and silkworm matters are over, the flower and fruit fields come next; as long as it waits for a little water to come in Small Fullness, everyone must soak the grain seeds and make the seedling fields, and when it is near Mangzhong, everyone must prepare to transplant the seedlings.</p>
<p>Uncle A Shun got up early this morning, and he went to the pillar to take down that "Yinyang He Li Tong Shu" to read: although he did not know many characters, but the blind man reading long lines, even more so, the major and minor solar terms of the year were familiar to him. He turned to April:</p>
<p>"M! April is small, May is big, the 20th of April is Small Fullness, and the 7th of May is Grain in Ear. Although the Small Fullness water does not come, the grain seeds must always be soaked. There is not a grain of our own grain seeds left, and Yinnan still has a lot, so let's go and discuss it with him first, and borrow a dozen or twenty catties to soak it and then talk about it." He thought to himself, then closed the almanac and hung it back in its original place, then sat down on the doorstep with a butt, looked up at the sky, the sky was so cloudy, but it didn't rain. He picked up the tide cigarette holder, desperately sucking, as if to solve many problems in this smoking!</p>
<p>"Last year, the water in the outer part of Zhihe Tou, the Lingdangzi, was small, so we didn't plant water chestnuts, and later changed to planting indica rice. Although we ate many hardships that we had never experienced before, we still received more than eight stone of steamed grain rice. But, but this year's water is even smaller, and many pieces of mud are protruding outside: although the water chestnut seeds have been sown, don't think there will be water chestnuts to pick. Even the indica rice, I'm afraid, won't have any hope!" His wife had just dressed the little Mao, who was only a week old, from the room, and when she heard her man mention the matter of soaking the grain seeds, she babbled like this as she walked to the stove door to ask. Uncle A Shun did not reply, but continued to smoke the tide cigarette, and his eyes were fixed on the messy stones in the courtyard. Suddenly, a spider hung down from the eaves and happened to fall on his forehead. He slapped it with his hand, and a bubble of liquid burst out. He looked at his palm, and the innocent little spider had turned into a meat paste, so he wiped the dirt on his hands on his straw shoes, but continued to think about his concerns in his heart:</p>
<p>"If the Dang fields can't be planted, dreaming of planting in the mountain fields is impossible...? The water in the river is only a foot deep, and this year won't be better than last year! The source of water will be cut off in the future..." His wife interrupted and said:</p>
<p>"But it's not okay not to plant, everyone else is transplanting seedlings, and we can't let a few fields be empty, we have to try our luck, maybe the Small Fullness water doesn't come, but the yellow plum water will come sooner or later."</p>
<p>"It's already too late when the yellow plum water comes, and the seedlings in the fields can be burned as firewood!"</p>
<p>"It's always better than not coming at all, it's always better to have something to salvage."</p>
<p>"Never mind, let's soak the grain first!" He said weakly, and went to Yinnan with a bamboo basket to borrow grain seeds.</p>
<p>After borrowing fifteen catties of japonica rice grains, he carefully walked to the river to wash it clean, and floated out all the floating grains, filled a light crock with clean water, and poured all the basket of wool grains into it, and then pressed it in the corner of the courtyard.</p>
<p>He silently ate breakfast, and carried a hoe and iron harrow to the Hengtian Tou to make a seedling field; his wife was at home sorting out silkworm-raising furniture;</p>
<p>"Hey! We haven't raised silkworms, but it's still the same as doing housework." She said to herself.</p>
<p>They raised a season of silkworms, but did not see a silkworm cocoon, and now their lives for a year must be entrusted to the autumn harvest in the future; what was borrowed before, what is eaten now, and what will be needed in the future, must all wait for the autumn harvest to compensate. But the impression given to him in front of him is too bad; so that this distant, vague hope, finally sinks in an invisible, untouchable abyss!</p>

<h3>The Difference Between Envoys and Ambassadors</h3>
<p>In the past half-month, countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan have successively promoted their envoys to China to the rank of ambassador. However, many general readers are unclear about the distinction between "envoy" and "ambassador," so we have received numerous inquiries in recent days. In addition to replying to each letter separately, the editor believes it is necessary to provide a public explanation and will summarize the differences below:</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>According to current international practice, diplomatic representatives are divided into four ranks: first-class ambassadors, second-class envoys, third-class ministers resident, and fourth-class chargés d'affaires. Heads of missions to major powers are always ambassadors, while only envoys are sent to countries of secondary importance. This is because an ambassador represents the monarch or head of state, while an envoy represents the government. The rank of ambassador is one level higher than that of envoy, and in terms of international protocol, sending an ambassador is naturally much more courteous. Furthermore, an ambassador can directly and promptly meet with diplomatic authorities and request an audience with the head of state. This offers certain advantages in diplomatic communication or when dealing with specific negotiations. In countries such as Britain and the United States, it is very difficult for envoys from secondary countries to gain an audience with the foreign minister of the host country. One must send in a request well in advance, and if the minister is unavailable, only a director, counselor, or deputy minister may be available for a meeting. In terms of protocol and diplomatic relations, this is naturally inferior to having an ambassador. Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan all exchange ambassadors because they are all major powers and therefore treat each other as equals. However, they treat China differently. China has always been looked down upon by other countries. With the exception of Russia, which resumed diplomatic relations with China after its revolution and exchanged ambassadors, the heads of mission of other countries stationed in China were still envoys, treating China as a country of secondary importance. This is truly a humiliation! Not long ago, Italy was the first to promote its head of mission to China to the rank of ambassador, and in the past month, Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan have also successively elevated their heads of mission in China. On the surface, it seems that they have all recognized China as a major power, which is worth celebrating. However, we must understand that the promotion of the heads of mission to China by the major powers is not the result of China's own increased strength but a kind of diplomatic maneuver in the international arena. We should take advantage of this international situation, rouse ourselves, and strive to achieve genuine equality in both name and reality, so that China can obtain truly equal treatment. This is the understanding that the general public should have regarding the changes in relations between the various countries and China.</p>
<p>The editor has always prioritized individual replies in this column, as readers are well aware. Due to space constraints in the future, only questions that are of particular relevance to the general public will be answered in the newspaper; other inquiries will only be answered by letter. To avoid misunderstandings, this is hereby clarified.</p>

<p>Starting today, Fuxing Radio will broadcast Zhou Yuquan's "Jade Dragonfly" every night from 10:40 PM to 11:30 PM. Fengming Advertising Agency has been operating the Great World Zhonghua Radio with great success, and it has therefore been well-received by listeners. Currently, during the summer season, the Great World is very crowded with visitors, so there is some interference during broadcasts. Listeners of the company, not knowing the reason, have sent letters of inquiry. Mr. Yuan Fengju and Mr. Hua Zhenya, directors of the agency, are deeply grateful and have decided to make major renovations to the broadcasting chamber to ensure clear sound quality. Therefore, broadcasting will be temporarily suspended for one or two days during the renovation. Once the work is completed, broadcasting will resume as usual. It is also reported that the agency is preparing an unprecedented grand special program to be broadcast at a later date to repay the enthusiasm of its supporters. It is expected that there will be a great sensation at that time. It is hoped that all circles will pay attention to it.</p>

Based on what we know, we would like to provide an introduction: (1) Cui is a member of the magic associations of England, France, the United States, and the International Federation of Magic Societies, the first in the Chinese magic community. (2) He performs over 50 large and small acts, lasting for two hours, without mixing in songs, dances, martial arts, or comedy to lengthen the time. This fully demonstrates his personal skills and the true value of magic. (3) All the programs are either invented by magic circles in various countries or by Cui himself. These are many unique skills that have not been performed by others, refreshing the audience's eyes and ears. (4) All programs are performed independently by himself, without relying on assistants to get by. (5) Cui's younger brother, Cui Lingtong, who is only ten years old, is also able to perform European and American magic, is lively and charming, and is truly remarkable. (6) He has also improved many of our country's inherent magic tricks. In the future, his performance overseas will further promote national glory.</p>
<h3>Lianhua Sound Recordist Mr. Chen Baochang (Omitted Yesterday)</h3>
<h3>Odds and Ends from "Homesickness"</h3>
<p>There are three songs in "Homesickness." "Good Night Song" and "Homesickness Song" are sung by Ms. Lang Yuxiu of the American Liyin Academy, whose singing is melodious and pleasing to the ear, adding a lot to "Homesickness." Ms. Lang is truly an outstanding talent in the music scene.</p>
<p>The dubbing of "Homesickness" is a great success. It is no exaggeration to say that it is one of the most outstanding films in the Chinese film industry. The sound of each scene is able to match the plot. The dubbing of the battlefield scene is particularly excellent, making people's hair stand on end as if they were on the scene.</p>
<p>What is most satisfying here is that the images are full of poetry, and the camera angles are beautiful, refreshing the audience and creating a different kind of artistic conception that helps the moving plot in the film.</p>
<p>The main message of "Homesickness" is that in this time of serious national crisis, if the Chinese nation does not rise again, then everyone will be in danger of being separated from their families and losing their hometowns.</p>
<p>"Homesickness" will be released as soon as it passes the central review. This is Shen Xiling's masterpiece after "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours."</p>

<h3>Overview of the British Automotive Industry in the First Four Months of This Year</h3>
<p>— Shadow Stay</p>
<p>(1) Amazing Domestic Market Records The British automotive industry has made significant progress in recent years, and this year in particular has been booming. The number of private cars produced broke all previous British records in the first quarter. In the first four months of this year, the number of new car registrations increased from 66,824 in the same period last year to 83,866. Not only passenger cars but also trucks saw a similar increase in registrations, from 22,514 in the same period last year to 24,612 this year. If we further analyze the registration figures by horsepower, large cars have also clearly increased. The number of new cars with 25 horsepower or more registered this year increased by half compared to the same period last year. However, in fact, most of the new cars currently being manufactured by British factories are not around 25 horsepower but small 10-horsepower cars. At the same time, we can also note that the environment for the British automotive industry has improved because the car horsepower tax has been significantly reduced. The increase in the number of high-horsepower cars is naturally due to this reason.</p>
<p>(2) Sharp Increase in Overseas Market Sales The British car market had considerable development in the domestic market in the first four months of this year, as mentioned above, but at the same time, the overseas market has also developed similarly. In particular, large cars and high-horsepower vehicles have made considerable progress in exports recently. In recent months, Hooper, a well-known London car body manufacturer, has shipped many new car bodies overseas and is currently working hard to prepare to deliver the orders it has received one after another. Countries such as India, Australia, Spain, Turkey, Romania, Hungary, and Switzerland have all ordered large quantities of car bodies from the factory. Most of these car bodies are equipped with Rolls-Royce chassis. A particularly large car body, mounted on a 40-50 horsepower Rolls-Royce chassis, was recently completed and delivered to the President of the West Indian Republic. In fact, this can be considered an armored car because it is covered in bulletproof steel plates and glass. Even so, the weight of the entire car is only five times heavier than an ordinary car.</p>
<p>(3) Good Performance in Car Races In recent years, British cars have not only made considerable progress in sales but have also clearly improved in engineering compared to the past. We can get some evidence from the results of the races alone. Recently, a Duke Gobel drove a "Qingdao" brand car again to participate in a car race in Daddonay and achieved an amazing record. Therefore, he won general recognition that the "Qingdao" brand car is a number of cars. During the competition, there was also an old 10-horsepower, two-cylinder Rolls-Royce car manufactured in 1904-05. This old car is owned by the South Kai-Deng Place Science Museum. Although it is 30 years old, the competition results showed a very good performance. The facts tell us that not only have the recent products of British cars achieved amazing results, but even old cars have considerable achievements.</p>
<p>(4) On-Site Test of Lubricating Oil Recently, a famous scientist, Mr. Lu Ai, conducted an on-site test of lubricating oil in Brockland to prove which method of using lubricating oil is the best and which lubricating oil can travel longer. Using the products of the Qier Mu Oil Company, under the guidance of Mr. Lu Ai, the specified lubricating oil was used up and tested on-site once. During the test, two identical 1935 Austin cars were used to travel 550 miles and then stopped. The results showed that the inside of the cylinder, in addition to leaving a thin film, had no remaining oil. Calculated by speed, the car traveled 30 miles per hour. One new car used the best lubricating oil to accelerate and stopped after traveling 9.6 miles. The other car used Qier Mu Oil and stopped after traveling 16 miles. Therefore, the facts have told us that sufficient lubricating oil can make acceleration powerful, and the driving time of the vehicle can also be longer.</p>
<p>(5) Ascension Memorial and the Automotive Industry The entire month of May in England was a celebration of the 25th anniversary of King George's ascension to the throne and was very lively. People from all over England flocked to London to see the excitement, and even overseas tourists took this opportunity to arrive by boat in batches. As a result, hotels declared that they were fully booked, and the waiters in the restaurants were yelling that the dishes were sold out. All kinds of lively situations are naturally endless. The automotive business is no exception. The number of cars in London has increased sharply due to the increased number of tourists from all over the country driving to London. The business of taxis and public buses has increased threefold, which proves that the automotive business has benefited from the King's Ascension Memorial. Undoubtedly, many tourists need cars when they stay in London. Maybe they will buy a new car to take back when they leave London. Therefore, car dealers in London have displayed a large number of new cars in their showrooms. Vauxhall cars with 12-14 horsepower have branch offices in London. These vehicles are very popular with tourists. The 1934 Vauxhall car had amazing results. Old cars are also quite active in the market, and there are many tourists who buy and sell them.</p>
<p>(6) Extreme Attention to Road Problems Under this situation, traffic in England has become increasingly congested. Therefore, a group of road authorities have had to pay extra attention to road safety plans to bring the country's roads to the most economical and safest limits. The most important issue at present is how to make the cost of road construction the most economical and the most durable in the future. According to the research results of British road scientists, the road building material must be hard. In terms of pressure, each square inch can withstand 200 pounds of force. The surface is covered with a layer of small stones. The fine bumps on the road surface must be removed. It must not only be glossy but also non-slip. This will naturally increase the safety problem. The repair of old roads and the opening of new roads are currently being actively carried out by British road authorities. The results of the road construction movement will directly and indirectly promote the automotive business.</p>
<h3>A Collection of New Automotive News</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Advocating Car Tax Revenue for Highways: The American Road Builders' Association and Highway Exhibition recently held its 32nd annual meeting in Washington. Attending were highway officials, engineers, contractors, and manufacturers from various cities and states, totaling no fewer than 5,000 people. At the time, the assembly advocated that all national gasoline taxes and car license fees should be used for road construction in various states, instead of being used for emergency relief or other purposes. Highway officials stated: Currently, various states are diverting this tax revenue for other purposes, amounting to no less than US$200,000,000 annually. If this continues, the future of highways is in danger, and it will inevitably lead to various states being unable to participate in the expenditure of federal highway projects. The main advocacy in the meeting was to continue with complete road design planning, with all road tax revenue being used for road administration. Federal road construction funding must also continue to be allocated as before.</p>
<p>Scheduled Completion of the American Automobile Bridge: The automobile bridge between San Francisco and Oakland is scheduled to be completed in December 1936. This bridge is divided into upper and lower layers, specifically for automobile traffic. Driving from the Oakland end towards the bridge, one first passes a wide tree-lined avenue, one and a quarter miles long. After passing the toll booth, one easily ascends to the upper layer, traveling 19,000 feet to Yerba Buena Island in the middle. After passing this island, there are four huge towers, reaching the two-mile road at the western end. Traveling another mile reaches the San Francisco terminus. Trucks travel on the lower level of the bridge. Except for the 3,000 feet crossing Yerba Buena Island, the western side is traversed by huge tunnels. The entire bridge is divided into two layers to ensure the balance of automobile driving. The upper level has six lanes, and the lower level has five lanes. Among them, three lanes are for trucks, and the other two lanes are for streetcar tracks. The tree-lined avenue on the upper level is ten feet wide per lane, divided into two speed categories. The four middle lanes allow speeds of 45 to 55 miles per hour, while the two outer lanes allow speeds of 30 to 45 miles per hour. According to expert estimates, in the first year of the bridge's completion and opening, namely 1937, approximately 8,000,000 vehicles will pass through. In 1943, it will be 10,000,000 vehicles. In 1950, it will be 12,500,000 vehicles. However, an average of 30,000,000 vehicles can pass through annually without any congestion concerns. The greatest advantage of this bridge is that it separates vehicles according to their speed, distinguishing them by their speed.</p>
<p>Kansas City Focuses on Road Traffic Safety: The number of vehicle accidents in Kansas City, USA, was quite high last year. The number of people who lost their lives due to vehicle accidents was 100. The number this year should be less, as the number of fatal cases has decreased to two-thirds compared to the same period last year. Currently, the Kansas City police authorities are making every effort to promote road safety campaigns. Police officers riding bicycles are constantly patrolling the main road intersections. Those arrested for drunk driving are either punished with hard labor at the city farm or fined and have their driver's licenses revoked. The laws regarding driver's licenses are also currently under consideration, as the current management of driver's licenses is not as strict as mentioned above.</p>
<p>Decline in Austrian Car Registrations: Among Austria's 600,000 population, there are only 18,870 cars. Comparing cars to the population, there is only one car for every 300 residents. This is according to an estimate by Mr. Stralssen, president of the Austrian Automobile Club. In addition, there are 15,400 trucks, 7,300 taxis, and 51,670 motorcycles. While car registrations are increasing in various European countries, such as Germany with a 20% increase, Austria's car registrations decreased by 39% in 1934. The formation of this situation is largely due to high car taxes.</p>
<p>Morris Car's Long-Distance Driving Performance: Recently, someone signing as MC published an article in the Straits Echo, praising his car trip between Penang and Singapore, proving the economy and durability of the Morris car. The gist is that he bought a Morris Eight car in Penang and drove it for 600 miles. He decided to take a trip to Singapore during the holidays, so he left Bukit Mertajam at 8:45 am on a Saturday morning for Singapore. He did not stop on the way and arrived in Ipoh at 12:00 noon. He left Ipoh at 1:00 pm and arrived in Kuala Lumpur at 6:00 pm. The travel time was seven hours and forty-five minutes, with a gasoline consumption of five and a half gallons and no cylinder oil. The next morning, he departed at 8:00 am and arrived in Singapore at 6:15 pm, which was Sunday evening. The driving time was eight and a half hours, with six gallons of gasoline and no cylinder oil. In addition to him being the driver for the entire trip, there were three other passengers and 100 pounds of luggage. The car drove very well without any obstacles. On the return trip, he took the Malacca route, adding one more passenger and 50 pounds of luggage. He left Singapore at 8:50 am on Tuesday morning and arrived in Muar at 1:00 pm. He continued at 2:30 pm and arrived in Kuala Lumpur at 7:00 pm. The driving time was eight hours and twenty minutes, with a gasoline consumption of six gallons and no cylinder oil. The next morning, he left Kuala Lumpur at 8:00 am, reached Ipoh at 1:00 pm, and returned to Bukit Mertajam at 5:15 pm. The driving time was seven hours and forty-five minutes, with a gasoline consumption of five and a half gallons and no cylinder oil. Throughout the entire round trip, this car had no obstacles and no need for mechanical adjustments, so no repairs were touched. He used the top gear when climbing mountains, except in Menting and Taiping, where he shifted to second gear. He is not boasting, but having driven cars for nearly thirty years, he can honestly say that the 1935 Morris Eight car is the best among small cars. He also thanked Sir Nuffield for the car being equipped with low-pressure tires, providing a stable ride, and using Wakefield oil for lubrication. Before leaving Singapore, the engine casing appeared dry, so he added half a gallon of oil. Although this car traveled 1,300 miles, no half gallon of oil was added to the engine because there was no need. When it reached Bukit Mertajam, the oil level was still full. The gasoline consumption was about 46 miles per gallon, which he thought was very good considering the passengers and luggage on board. Therefore, his advice is "Buy a Morris, no obstacles, and satisfaction guaranteed."</p>
<h3>Some Interesting Ford Statistics</h3>
<p>(1) The Rouge River Plant in Dearborn, Michigan, covers 1,096 acres. (2) The number of employees at the site once reached as many as 104,000 people. (3) The floor area of the plant totals 7 million square feet. (4) If the windows and skylights of the Rouge River Plant need to be replaced, it would require as much as 330 acres of glass. (5) The ore transporter named "Henry Ford II" carries as much as 12,500 tons of iron ore in one trip. (6) The ore in this ore transporter is unloaded by large unloaders that can lift 12 to 17 tons each time. (7) The huge warehouse (at the Rouge River Plant) can hold as much as 2,000,000 tons of ore, coal, and lime. (8) The railway within the Rouge Plant is 98 miles long. (9) There is an aerial conveyor</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>that is 5 miles long. (10) The amount of water taken from the Detroit River and input into the Ford Plant is 10 million gallons. The amount of water used by the Ford Plant is more than the combined amount used by the three cities of Detroit, Washington, and Cincinnati during the same period. (11) There are 240 coke ovens, producing a total of 3,675 tons of coke, 55 million cubic feet of coal gas, and other valuable by-products every 24 hours. (12) The plant always has "1,200 tons of liquid iron available for immediate needs." (13) Each worker in the Rouge Plant has at least four horsepower of mechanical equipment to assist in their work. All heavy work is done by machinery. The reason why Ford Motor Company can produce inexpensive and high-quality cars is due to the large-scale production indicated by the above points.</p>
<h3>Recent Statistics on American Automobile Sales</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ang</p>
<p>American automobile sales have dominated the world market for years, but in 1932, the global recession affected the automobile industry, causing it to decline sharply. In recent years, as the world economy has recovered slightly, the automobile industry has also shown signs of recovery. According to expert statistics, the total trade value was US$82,185,100 in 1932, US$93,968,383 in 1933, showing a slight increase, and US$198,314,4855 in 1934, breaking the recent record, but still inferior to the golden age of US$298,652,048 in 1930.</p>
<p>South American countries sell the most passenger cars, as their people are wealthy and the roads are good, mostly cement and asphalt roads, so people are happy to buy cars for transportation. Other countries such as Argentina, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom also sell a lot. Trucks are sold the most in places like Japan, India, and Australia. Last year, Japan jumped to first place. Trucks are necessary tools in war, and everything from transporting soldiers, food, and weapons relies on them. Japan's purchase of large numbers of trucks reveals its intentions.</p>

<h3>New Record for the V8 Ford</h3>
<p>Those who are engaged in sea life and desire land adventures are not commonly seen, but Chief Steward Harry Cox, a well-known chief steward on the large Lai Postboat, is an exception. Recently, Mr. Cox in Albany, New York, had urgent business and had to quickly reach Seattle. He personally drove his newly purchased V8 Ford car and traveled 3,240 miles in 60 and a half hours. Although he could not break any speed records set by professional drivers, it is commendable for a non-professional driver to achieve such good results. Moreover, Mr. Cox drove himself throughout this long journey without any help from others. Mr. Cox is quite famous in various parts of the Far East because he not only served as the head of the cooking department for President Coolidge for many years, with excellent results, but is also enthusiastic about wireless electricity and broadcasting activities.</p>
