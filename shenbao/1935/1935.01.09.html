<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國之遠東政策　有</h3>
<p>自日本廢棄華府海約以來。太平洋上之緊張局面。已鮮有緩和之可能。日本旣於大連星浦召集所謂關東軍會議。復高唱對俄外交新方針之確立。與非武裝地帶之實現。至於日本商民在其政府卵翼之下。絡繹從事於對華經濟之考察。與夫南洋羣島新市塲之開拓。尤足徵其朝野人士對外政策之一致。此中外報章所以有英美聯合之說也。據吾人觀察。英國固與日本有利害衝突之點。而美日間之裂痕。殆更難以彌補。美人將如何而應付當前之危機。</p>
<p>自足引起世人最大之注意也。</p>
<p>當日本宣吿終止華府海約之頃。吾人卽聞美國方針。將側重於不激起日本反感之條件下。進行英美之密切合作。顧吾人視此爲美人隨機應變之一種策略則可。謂其已忘情於英日間之舊誼而恃此種合作爲積極應付日本之唯一方針。則未免去美國遠東政策之眞相太遠矣。今後美國對於中國門户開放之原則。或不欲如向來之堅持。然此正可爲其舍口頭抗爭作實力凖備之反證。蓋美人固深諳外交情勢者也。日昨海外電訊。美總統羅斯福果已咨文國會。要求於一九三六年國家預算案中。規定國防經費九萬萬美金之巨。約佔總支岀百分之十五。據羅氏說明。此數僅爲充實海空軍力之用。以期達到條約所許可之限度。究竟此外有無國防上之額外支岀。則猶爲一種不便公開之秘密。至若積極經營夏威夷之珍珠港。以及努力充實北太平洋沿岸之國防。與夫在一九三六年底完成七十八艘新軍艦之計劃。則固爲其官方所承認之事實矣。美國驟增如許海軍經費之支岀。其爲實力抵抗日本之遠東獨覇政策。固有目所共鑒也。</p>
<p>抑美國推行其遠東政策之原動力。固不止於軍事之一端。目前太平洋上列强競爭之重心。尚不在於軍備。而實在於經濟。因是發展海外贸易開拓海外市塲。以期排洩過剩商品。榨取各項原料。實爲美國遠東政策之目的。與英日相較。未嘗有二致也。在遠東之白銀問題方面。美國操縱太平洋勢力之雄厚。已見一斑。最近華盛頓政府除派遣專員調查菲列濱之市塲外。復贊助其商業團體作遠東市塲考察之工作。皆足爲其重視遠東經濟利益之說明。日美雙方之活動。針鋒相對。調和無從。此又爲我國人所應注意者也。</p>

<p>歐戰後一頁新史法意恊約簽字</p>
<p>促德返國聯談軍縮</p>
<p>相與合作以維和平</p>
<p>（羅馬）　意首相墨索里尼與法外長賴伐爾今日簽定重要恊定三種及附加議定書若干件、此爲歐戰後普遍和平運動之一大進步、三項主要恊定如下、</p>
<p>（一）法意殖民地恊定、</p>
<p>（二）多瑙河流域公約、兼及保障奥國獨立、</p>
<p>（三）歐洲和平恊商公約、</p>
<p>此次重要之簽約儀式係於今晚七時在威尼期宮舉行、墨索里尼代表意政府與賴伐爾代表法政府首先簽字後、意國岀席國聯代表阿樂西爵士·意國外交長蘇維區·及法國駐意大使狄香布倫·亦爲簽證、此外復簽定若干文件、旨在造成歐洲之和平空氣、其中明定法意恊力邀請德國重返國聯一致合作以維和平、</p>
<p>美聯社茲自負責方面得悉、英德不外將通吿接受保障奥國完整公約、墨索里尼及賴伐爾簽字後卽握手道賀、情意熱烈、法意復同意、根據一九三四年一月十九日之意會備忘錄、重開軍縮談判、以期解决德國軍備平等要求·德國重返國聯·及决定德國軍縮限度等問題、此項恊定現已送往柏林當局、此間外交界稱、德國贊成此項計劃云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）　法外長賴伐爾今午由羅馬起程返巴黎、意相墨索里尼·外次蘇維志·國聯薩爾委員會主席阿洛西·及其他重要意人、皆親往送行、沿路觀者如堵、歡聲雷動、兵士排列途中、嚴加保護、火車站斷絶交通、軍樂隊在月台外奏樂、法外長與意相臨别情形、至爲友好、法意間之友誼於此可見一斑、法意雙方對於恊定中載有軍備條文之說不置一詞、但聞此條文言及德國、據巴黎消息、此條文言及德國於重置軍備後、在某種戒備性質之條件下復回國聯事、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>法意互祝成功</h3>
<p>羅馬　意相墨索里尼與法外長賴伐爾昨晚簽定關於奥國獨立及意國所得北非讓與權之公約、此爲大戰以來、歐洲一般和平工作最偉大之成功、簽字地點爲維尼齊亞宮、計簽定主要恊定三種、外交議定書、一爲關於殖民事務之恊定、一爲關於多瑙河流域並保障奥國獨立之公約、一爲關於爲歐洲和平起見實行恊商政策者、此外尚有數文件、志在造成歐洲各國間之和平空氣、據現象觀之、政治恊定或將由法蘭西銀行輔助意大利銀行一舉完成之、</p>
<p>賴伐爾於簽定公約後卽向報界宣稱、兩國無一曾犧牲重要利益、吾人决計討論一切、纖細靡遺、俾公約可成爲現實的、吾人之政策、乃依道德平等之基礎以參加、其唯一目的係在和平組織之事業的可能機會供獻於各國政府、余堅信吾人之籲求、必獲響應云、賴氏致詞畢、墨索里尼起稱、吾人不可以爲一切已吿成功、吾人仍須培植兩國間之友誼、此爲共同光榮之文明與近今重大之試騐所形成者、墨氏繼乃讚揚賴氏、謂兩人曾受相同之政治經騐、故彼此相諒、末曰、判决直妄之年今已以歡然簽定條約開始矣、</p>
<p>昨晚當局曾發表簡短之公報、文中未載公約之内容、亦未述及限制軍備問題、但限制軍備、必佔條約之一部分、並聞其中尚載有法國擬邀德國復回國聯事、衆信此事必在議定書之一種涉及之、文中毫未露有仇對德國意、亦未言及德國重整軍備乃屬違法云、</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞爲殖民恊定中之焦點、意國於此恊定下獲有若干讓與權、數方面稱、法國已接受意國之申請、許意國在阿比西尼亞商業與殖民事務、得自由行動、惟此節未能由官方徵實、似亦不致見諸文字也、</p>
<p>英法政府近曾力勸意政府對於烏魯爾爭執與阿比西尼亞作和平解决近數日内意阿兩國間之關係、似已較有進步矣、</p>
<p>意國在殖民恊定下所得之讓與權如下、</p>
<p>（一）吐尼斯之意僑兩代保留其意大利國籍（二）意國將獲蒂比斯蒂瑪西夫北面之地一條、長八百哩、廣百哩、</p>
<p>（三）意國將獲法屬索瑪里倫之貝爾瑪台白土地、惟沃波克港不在内、意國得購吉波蒂至阿狄斯阿巴巴鐵路股份二千至三千股之間、</p>
<p>法國對於羅馬公約之成功、大爲歡迎、巴黎現覺德國不致置身局外、法意兩國對於趨向軍縮恊定所獲之進步、較初料爲佳、法國顯曾遷就意國之立塲、此使賴伐爾將來之至倫敦更見重要、</p>
<p>德國政界對於法意妥恊、迄今未作評論、據柏林路透電訊、德政府刻聚精會神從事與薩爾公民投票事有關之工作、故在下星期前似不致發表意見也、（八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>簽字後之公報</h3>
<p>　(羅馬)　法意恊定正式簽字後、於八點三十分向報界發表公報如下、（意相墨索里尼與法外長賴伐爾舉行法意談判之結果、業經簽訂有關兩國在菲洲利益及聲明兩國政府對於歐洲問題意見一致之恊定數種、墨索里尼與賴伐爾共同聲明、關於中歐問題必須獲得多方面諒解一層、兩國政府完全同意、並以爲應將關於中歐問題所已採用之主張、儘速提交有關各國審議、一方面等候此種多方面恊定之簽訂、另一方面則由法意兩國、以此種諒解之精神、共同審議各項應付時局之措置、）（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德外交界驚異</h3>
<p>（柏林）　羅馬談判急轉直下、法意兩國成立廣大之恊定、此間外交界人士聞之、似頗爲驚異、在法意恊定正式發表以前、此間外交當局雖拒絶採取任何立塲、然對於此種恊定、則不免露猜忌之情、其所以深加猜忌者、蓋因恐懼蕯爾區域公民投票後、德國之外交政策將因法意接近、而大受妨礙、且法意接近、不免使修改和約運動大受打擊也、德意志總彙報評論不干涉奥國内政一事、謂吾德國人民决不遺忘他國干涉内政之一重要事件、卽起草凡爾賽條約君、禁止奥國與德國合併是也、柏林日報則謂、意相墨索里尼向共國民表示、主張修改和約、言之屢矣、墨索里尼所以能得人心、多由於此種精神、勢力之所致、然今所謂保障中歐安全議定書、則與其修約之精神來免背道而馳、云云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）最近成立之意法恊定四種、雖僅公布一種、然其内容已盡爲外間推測知悉、各種政府卽可表示正式態度、據德國外交評論報稱、以與歐洲方面有關者而言、此項恊約必須分别爲二、卽法意恊商公約與中歐不干涉公約是也、其中唯法意恊約爲已成事實、蓋墨索里尼氏已以保持奥國獨立之責任、由意國獨任、而改由法國分任矣、至於中歐公約則促其實現者不僅法意兩國、舉凡中歐各國皆與焉、大國尤有關係、蓋此不僅爲奥國問題、實爲全部多瑙河間題也、此則牽涉匈牙利與小恊約各國之關係以及南斯拉夫與意大利之關係、雖然、法意邦交之進展、實爲歐局之一大關鍵、所不可忽視者、現尚有許多問題急待解决、尤以經濟問題爲甚云、（八日民國電）</p>
<h3>西門表示欣慰</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英外相西門昨夜偕其夫人返至英京後、對人云、（聞羅馬恊約之成、深爲欣慰余雖未獲睹其正式全文、然此約之成實一佳事也、）西門又云、（法總理佛蘭亭及外長賴伐爾已可如約於月内作倫敦之游矣）云云、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）　英國駐意大使德魯蒙爵士、本日下午曾與法國外長賴伐爾會晤、迨法意恊定簽字後、德魯蒙復由意首相墨索里尼接見、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>匈牙利之不安</h3>
<p>布達佩斯　羅馬舉行之保奥獨立談判、匈牙利對之已起不安之感、據政府方面所稱、關於奥國現在之邊境保障一事、匈牙利輿論均不贊成政府與聞、因奥國現有之波根蘭區域原係匈國領土、嗣後齊亞農條約成立、遂劃歸奥國、倘匈國現復參加保障奥國現有疆土、則不啻無條件放棄該項土地也、匈牙利對於現在捷克及羅馬尼亞所有之邊界、均抱不满之態度、惟對於南斯拉夫一方面則尚可提岀保留案、而暫時加以同意云、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>美國深感興味</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　法意兩國成立羅馬恊定、尤其是成立關於德國軍備問題之議定書、國務院聞訊、頗獲深切之印象、白宮及國務院均相信、軍縮會議復活之時期、已非遙遠、美國駐瑞士公使威爾遜、現定於一月十日、携羅斯福總統訓令、重返歐洲、此間一般輿論以爲軍縮會議塲地、已經掃清、使德國不難重行加入軍縮會議、在下届軍縮談話中、美國或將大事活動、羅斯福總統於一九三三年所提議嚴格規定侵略國定義及去年所提岀修改海上自由原則之主張、大約將重行提岀、如限制軍備恊定、有成立之機會、則本年日内瓦第一次會議中、必有詳細之討論云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奥政府否認副揆遇剌</h3>
<p>（維也納）　政府今日否認共產黨謀剌副總理兼内衛軍總司令史泰亨堡親王之消息、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>希特勒改組衛隊用以應付内敵</h3>
<p>（柏林）　據可恃方面傳岀消息、德元首希特勒現秘密改組其自已精銳黑衫衛隊、將以二萬人組成第一團、其所用之軍械、較現有黑衫衛隊更爲精利、聞此舉之目的、在用以應付内敵、此乃裁黑衫衛隊之先聲、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>薩爾布魯根　薩爾區投票委員會商請統治委員會後、已於今日下令、禁止人民在本月十日起至投票揭曉日止舉行集會、全區内不論公私或團體一律須遵守此禁令、惟劇院及電影院則不在禁列、（七日國民電）、</p>
<p>（柏林）　林此間數家報紙對於薩爾投票委員會將昨日所投之票取銷一節、頗爲怨忿、其作廢之原因係投票者於投票時舉行希特勒式舉手禮及不用黑色鉛筆書寫、致犯投票章程、查昨日投票者爲公務人員、因十三日總投票時彼等將爲職務所覊、不克投票也、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯報　薩爾區域之行政官吏警察及鐵道工人、須於十三日、卽公民投票日、繼續工作、故公民投票委員會、特爲之設立投票處、使其於本日先行投票、惟投票人數、似頗爲寥寥、截至目前止、薩爾勃魯克選民二千二百人中、投票者僅二百○一人、本日不及投票之公務人員、明日或十三日仍可再行投票、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>學生五千攻紅衫黨總部墨西哥之敎爭</h3>
<p>墨西哥　反宗敎運動擾亂墨西哥之治安已數年、今日情勢又趨向熱化、學生五千人突然進攻紅衫黨總部、逐岀反天主敎之紅衫黨黨員、槍傷紅衫黨黨員五人、憤怒之學生以磗石擲擊總部、擊破門窗玻璃、據稱、紅衫黨首先開槍、雙方繼方互轟約十五分鐘之久、紅衫黨始就範、學生攻入後、將室中各物搗毁一空、警察及救火車於岀事後到塲彈壓、驅散在塲學生、幸無死傷、被捕學生約十餘人、其餘學生則整隊行徑街市、高呼反對政府之反宗敎政策口號、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>伊波邊界爭執列入國聯議程</h3>
<p>波斯外長抵日内瓦</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　波斯外長加才米、爲波斯與伊拉克間邊境事件、前來參加國聯會之討論、業於本日抵此、按去年十一月伊拉克政府以公函送達國聯會、謂波斯時有侵犯邊境行爲、請國聯行政院予以處理云云、此案當卽列入本届行政院議程、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>秘魯叛亂蕩平</h3>
<p>秘魯利馬　羣衆百人進攻卡耶馬加之營房、經過數小時之激戰後叛亂卒吿蕩平、死叛徒七人及兵士一人、叛徒第二次進攻、幸中央軍堅守不退、致未爲所乘、叛徒二次被逐後、營房中之兵士、反守爲攻、向前突擊、叛徒遂竄入山中、（七日國民社電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄快車互撞</h3>

<p>一說岀於破壤行動</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　莫斯科與列寗格勒之鐵路綫昨有特别快車二列相撞、結果死十六人、傷六十七人、聞兩車行於同一綫上、前車機器稍損、速度减低、而後車司機人未注意於停車之信號、仍照常開行、以致與前車後部相撞、前車之客車三輛被撞起火、車皆損毁、當道現已設法查明責在何方、後車之司機員及其助手二人、又鐵路雇員三人、皆被拘獲、如查有疎忽情事、當予以槍决、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　據小巴黎人報載莫斯科電稱、莫斯科幹綫有快車二列、在距列寗格勒一百三十五哩處互撞、有車數輛成爲虀粉、尚有三輛爲火焚燬、死傷甚衆、（八日路透電）</p>

<h3>對於修改現行商標法之管見（續）何焯賢</h3>
<p>三關於商標在華使用問題</p>
<p>吾國工商業尚屬幼穉，不能與資本主義發展至最高峯之歐美各國相抵抗，這種情形，稍爲留心世界經濟及國内經濟狀况的人，都能了解。則吾國商標法除保障商標專用權外，尚應顧及本國國民經濟之根本缺憾，而具有一種奬勵方在抬頭的工商業底精神，自不待言。現行商標法，對於相同近似之商標，是准許實際最先使用者註册的（見商標法第三條），而善意繼續使用十年以上之商標，且有優先註册的權利（同法第四條），但所謂實際最先使用，及善意使用十年，如果不加以限制，恐實受其惠者，不見得是落後的本國工商界，而是工商業先進的外國人。我國工商業發展遲緩，商人對於商標稍加重視，不過是最近三數年來的事情；但歐美各國，在工業革命以後，跟着資本主義的高度發度，工商業的進步，十倍於吾國，其對於商標之重視至少比吾國早半個世紀以上。吾國之商標，除了三數個老牌子外，我敢說没有幾個像人家有悠久之使用事實的。在此情形之下，遇有我國的商標與外國的商標偶然巧合，如果使用不及十年，勢非盡數爲外國商標悠久的使用事實所打例不可。又如我國有一商標已經註册，在同一商品有外商以相同近似之商標來華呈請註册，挾其在外國之使用歷史，大可用評定之程序（見商標法第三十條第一欵），撤銷我國業經註册之商標。我固不能否認商標法最大的作用在保障商標專用權，但我們審忖國内經濟情形，怵目於資本主義國家對華經濟侵略的慘酷，總覺得外國商人以其商標在本國使用之悠久事實，壓倒吾國的商標，爲（此風不可長）。一部良好的法律，誠然要盡其法律上的使命，如商標法必得能觳保障商標專用權。但在另一方面，一國度之法律必得有適合本國國情之特徵，方能配稱完满而無遺憾。現行商標法對於商標使用問題，未加限制，這從（適合國情）一點觀之，似乎不遺憾。爲匡救</p>
<p>這個缺憾，我主張規定商標使用之事實，以在我國國境内之使用事實爲限。則現行商標法第三條及第四條關於商標使用先後的規定，均應加以（在中華民國境内）之限制，如是，原條文應改爲（二人以上，······各别呈請註册時，應准在中華民國境内實際最先使用者註册；······）（第三條）及（在中華民國境内，以善意繼續使用十年以上之商標，······）（第四條）。</p>
<p>四關於他問題</p>
<p>（甲）現行商標法第十九條第一項第一欵規定，商人於其註册商標自行變換，或加附記以圖影射而使用之者、商標局得以職權，或據利害關係人之呈請，予以撤銷處分。這一欵條文，似乎祇能拘束已註册之商標，不能拘束已審定而未經註册的商標。實際上註册商標與審定商標有時間上之不同，審定商標經登載於商標公報六個月，别無利害關係人之異議，或經辨明其異議，方能註册（見商標法第廿七條）。從第十九條第一項第一欵之字面上看來，所謂註册商標，大可解釋作（已註册之商標）；若果這樣解釋，則審定商標自行變換或加附記以圖影射，商標局就不能加以取締。這就不能不說現行商標法有掛漏的地方。要補救這個掛漏的地方，我主張在第十九條第一項第三欵之後、增加（審定商標適用前項第一之欵規定）一項。</p>
<p>（乙）現行商標法第四條所規定的善意繼續使用十年以上之商標，我在上文已主張過應加在華吏用的限制。但我仔細一想，這項條文對於善意繼續使用十年以上的商標賦予特權，雖有在華使用的限制，仍不免有失之過寛之弊。所謂善意繼續使用這善意兩字，原來没有一定的界說，畢竟過於抽象。惟其没有一定的界說，對善意惡意就很難下一確切的估定。假如有商人蓄仿冒他人已註册的商標，預先在他的帳簿寫上使用已逾十年之記載，向商標局　請註册，商標局憑其帳簿上使用十年以上的記載，帳簿的確是千眞萬眞的，很難尋岀其惡意的所在；除非有利害關係人提岀有力的反證，力能辨明其並非岀於善意。商標局固未必准許這一類的商標註册，但這類蓄心仿人家商標的商人，總可利用他的商標呈請註册的機會，大賣其實在仿冒人家商標的貨品，而人家已註册商標的法益，勢必因此而大受損失了。又如商人代理銷售某種商標的貨品，在帳簿上大可登載商標名稱而略去代售字樣，經過十年，這個代售者，便可根據商標法第四條，將商標呈請註册，在此種情形底下，雖其實際係盜用他人的商標，但主管官署辦理這種商標註册－－通稱（四條註册），唯一的證據，祇有帳簿，而帳簿上明明有商標使用十年以上的記載，已如天衣之無縫，並無惡意的迹象可尋，結果勢難核駁其註册。從上述兩例觀之，足見善意是一種没有確定界說底抽象的規定，在在可以發生流弊的。本來這條法律，是賦予那些在商標法未頒行前有悠久使用歷史的商標一種優先註册的權利。在商標法頒行以後，一切的商標儘可援照商標法第一條呈請註册，如果確有使用的歷史，依據商標法第三條，並非不能取得專用權的。所以我主張第四條的條文，應該冠以（於本法施行前）數字，藉使取巧的商人，不能憑着這條法律，行其變相的仿冒。　　（丙）處理僞造商標，在刑法定有專條，職掌屬於各級法院，商標局本來是無權處理的。但法院對於僞造商標案件，一來因無辦理商標經騐，二來因無案卷可查，一經受理，無從判其眞僞。因此，前工商部曾於民國十八年間，咨請司法行政部通令各級法院，嗣後受理商標訟案，應先諮詢商標局然後審判（見司法行政部第八一二號通令）。這種辦法直到現在，還在繼續實行。然在一般商人心目中，總認定商標局是處理商標事件的唯一機關，在其已呈請册的商標被人仿冒時，如果對方的商標亦已呈註請註册，經審定後固然可以提岀異議（商標法第二十七條），經註册後亦可請求評定（同法第三十條），但如果那仿冒商標未經呈請註册，於是就向商標局請求鑑定眞僞，以便向法院起訴。商標局歷來對於這種請求鑑定事項，僅僅根據商標法施行細則第三十六條第十一欵的規定，發給一種證明書，名爲（鑑定證明書），内中所述，除兩造商標誰已呈請註册，誰未呈請註册，是否相同近似，另加貼兩方商標圖樣各一紙外，就没有什麽了。這種辦法本來是很通的，因爲可以利便商人向法院起訴，省得法院又向商標諮詢，公文旅行、展轉遲緩。但商標局發給（鑑定證明書）究竟根據現行商標法第幾條？遍覓現行商標法是找不岀不。我極主張這種發給（鑑定證明書）的辦法，爲的是它確有事實上的需要，可是我不贊成主管官署做於法無據的事，所以我很希望現行商標法中增加這麽一條文··（凡未經呈請註册之商標，與已註册之商標相同或近似時，行由利害關係人呈請商標局鑑定之）。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>綜上所述，我不敢說我已經指岀現行商標法一切未完善的所在，我更不敢承認我對於修改現行商標法已經擬就一個完密的方案。但我覺得現行商標法因時代演進的關係，對於完成（保障商標專用權）及（適合我國國情）的兩重使命，確實有些缺憾。我是堅决主張修改現行商標法的一個人，我的見解能否爲立法當局所採納，這是另一問題；但如果這篇文章能够引起廠商各界相當的注意，或者有人起來對現行商標法各項問題加以更精密的商榷，這便是我底最深切的願望。</p>

<h3>盧家灣台州會館内發現奇異火井</h3>
<p>井水乾後突岀熖火勢甚猛烈</p>
<p>火勢日夜不熄附近觀者甚多</p>
<p>科學家曾往視察謂地下有煤質</p>
<p>華東社云、最近有人發現一奇事、在盧家灣新橋路台州會館（卽台州公所）内、忽有火井一座、該井内終日冒岀燄火、熒熒不息、離地頗深、附近居民、引爲奇事、昨晨華東社記者特赴其地視察、果見其地之井内、有巨火噴岀、厥狀殊奇、爰將詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>火井歷史　本市華法交界處之盧家灣新橋路台州公所、佔地頗廣、其内有台州旅滬小學、大、其工廠中因需水甚多、故而開鑿一井、俾資便利、該井於民國九年卽築成、深可十餘丈、水亦源源不絶、初無他異、乃至民國十五年、井忽涸乾、不能再汲水、於是卽塡没之、又越五年、至民二十年、其地時震動、井之原處、且逐漸下陷、該廠人員、深以爲異、爲防止其下陷起見、乃塡以煤屑、而地則仍須低陷、該廠一俟其稍陷、卽塡平之、每年所塡之煤屑、須在五籮以上、該井附近、且時有地動、且發響聲、聲則隆隆如雷震、天雨更甚、該廠初據其地設賬房間、因其地震動甚烈、遂遷岀、最近其地因受陽光之晒曝、突然發熱、而地下忽有盛火噴裂而岀、</p>
<p>噴火情形　華東社記者昨晨特赴其地視察、該井刻已塡平、惟井口則依舊存在、井内水管、已浮岀於地面、火則自該水管内岀、火勢甚烈、炘炘向榮、高可及人、該廠特於其旁築以短磚、上可置鍋、燃燒水菜食物、據謂火力較柴炭爲大、亦廢物利用之道、該井内水管有二、一大一小、小者可以隨熄隨生、熄時祇須灌以冷水一勺、立卽撲滅、如欲再燃、則以火燒之、可立得巨火、至大管則因火勢猛烈、無法撲滅、</p>
<p>專家視察　自該處之火井發現之後、附近各地居民、聞訊咸往參觀、日有數十人、頗爲擁擠、台州公所本爲鬼居之處、今則門庭如市、頓現熱閙、且有一西籍科學專家、亦於昨日前往觀察、據彼研究、結果實因其地内含有多量之煤質、故而燃燒、此種火性、其力甚猛、且可永久不熄、實爲一天然之火爐云、</p>

<p>談判贖票　被綁之三船員、確皆貧困無錢者、本無納付贖欵之力、嗣因接得各人由匪窟中發信到家、言各人家况、已由匪中派人調查明白、亦知無力繳納巨金、今匪首已允從輕釋放、祇須各認伙食費若干、便可將三人放回、因之各家屬依照來函指示、特派代表一人、至香港與匪方代表接洽、談判納付三人之伙食費、顺便領三人返滬、在家屬方面、因景况艱難、而於代表赴港亦經商定即使認付伙食費、最多數目、每人不得超過四五百元、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　聞語掩啼痕賣身道苦留心窺請東投靠情殷</p>
<p>程志前望了胡嫂子道··你只看他這種形狀，當然對於這件事，也不會介意，那倒不必管了。只是他瘊去和小紀要那塊錢的時候，小紀一抺臉不認帳，說那是一句笑話。他們又不是······他頓了一頓，又道··這話我也不忍說。不過以爲這姑娘是和人家聯姻來了，成與不成，是男女兩家的事，那有媒人掏腰包的事？若是來一趟要一塊錢，那很好辦，茶房們可以和他另想辦法。那小紀說話，可不能像我這樣的含蓄，這姑娘，和我們是一般長一般大的人，没得錢，反要受這樣一番侮辱，你說可憐不可憐？老實說一句，他是聯什麽姻，無非是賣身體替三代人換碗飯吃。人到賣無可賣，賣到了自已身體的時候，那總是一件傷心的事。這事有了喜訊，也就身體有了買主，······忽然喔喔喔幾陣很低的聲音，在身邊發現岀來了。原來那月英姑娘，一陣傷心，兩行眼淚，像抛沙似的，在臉腮上直流下來。他不敢將身上這件衣服去擦眼淚，因爲這件衣服，是借得人家的。只好把裏面那件衣服的袖子扯了岀來，去揩抺淚珠。程志前也是說得高興了，他忘了自已所說的，在當面坐的姑娘，是否可以經受得了，現在月英哭起來了，他才覺得自已說話太放肆了，立刻呵了一聲，笑道··這是我錯了。姑娘，你别見怪。不過我總是一番好心。要不，胡嫂子同小紀吵閙的時候，我也不把你們讓到屋子裏來了。（一○七）</p>
<h3>極端主張納妾的元孝友</h3>
<p>— 望雲</p>
<p>納妾的人，怕不要喊起寃哉枉也！妾在法律上没有地位，家長枉自花了身價銀，岀了赡養費，依舊不得據爲已有。近日最高法院統一法令解釋委員會，解釋妾與人通姦，家長無吿訴之權，那麽凡是納妾的家長，合該齊聲道一句寃哉枉也！自古道··（偷來的鑼鼓，響不得），明明是自已的妾，也變了偷來的鑼鼓，便和他人有姦情，也是聲張不得，這不成了甘戴一頂緑頭巾麽？但是納妾的諸家長不要煩悶，我把北史所載拓跋魏時有一位贊揚納妾的元孝友所上的奏議，錄其大槪，料想納妾的諸家長見了，一定可以破涕爲笑咧。</p>
<p>（古者諸侯娶九女，士一妻一妾。晋令，諸王娶妾八人，侯娶妾六人，官品令第一二品有四妾，第三四品有三妾，第五六品有二妾，第七八品有一妾，所以陰敎聿修，繼嗣有廣，廣繼嗣，孝也。修陰敎，禮也。（中略）凡今之人，通無凖節！父母嫁女，則敎以妬，姑姊逢迎，相勸以忌，以制夫爲婦德，以能忌爲女工。夫妬忌之心生，則妻妾之禮廢，姦淫之兆興，此臣之所以痛恨者也。請以王公爲第一品，娶八妾，以備九女稱事，二品備七，三區四品備五，五品六品則二妻二妾··王侯將相，功臣子弟，苗裔满朝，傳祚無窮，此臣之志也。）　　倘使元孝友的提議，通過在今日立法院中，娶有小老婆的，都可以歡天喜地，喚幾聲（納妾萬歲）了。可惜這是歷史上的文章！</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （夏涔鵑）</p>
<p>三個弟兄在未曾娶妻前，彼此都相親相愛，如手如足。後來各各成家娶室後，却不時齟齬，連朝詬誶。這原因，不外乎大家都聽了床頭人枕狀所致，結果分家產打官司，親兄弟變做了對頭寃家。三國志上劉玄德說的··一妻子如衣服，兄弟如手足，衣服破尚可縫，手足斷不可續。一這話就不大確切。要曉得在現代，兄弟盤子看賤，老婆船子看貴啊！</p>
<h3>候審室中</h3>
<p>— 吳聊庵</p>
<p>市面是極度呈着蕭條和不景氣的現象，而法院裏的候審室，可就怪熱閙啦！</p>
<p>叮鈴！叮鈴！當辦公時間的鈴聲剛才搖過，那候審室裏，就早已擠满了男的，女的，老的，少的，這靜待着將要去受法律裁判的一羣。</p>
<p>在這羣人們的每一個臉部上，都很現露了一種憂慮的，恐懼的，沉默的，各個不同的悉容，以及那債權人們的猙獰面目，傲慢態度。假使我們去完全將它攝入開麥拉中，那又是一幕多麽深刻的面部表情！</p>
<p>一個满身垢污的西裝男子，雪白的硬領，幾乎變了黑色。頭髮是蓄得像藝術家一樣，憔悴而帶着慘白的臉色，一些也没有笑容，儘是坐在候審室的左角沉默着。在他對面的坐椅上，一位舉止輕浮而很時髦的摩登女郎；常常對他現岀一種自鳴得意的狀態，有時還要向他報嗤笑。原來他倆是某件離婚案中的一對男女主角啊！有些在候審的好事的人們，便拿他倆當作談話資料，竊竊地在私議着，猜疑着。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ，ＸＸＸ，從一個態度很嚴的庭丁口中厲聲的喊着當事人的姓名去開訊的時候，立刻就衝破了這候審室中的嘈雜聲浪，沉寂得幾乎連呼吸的聲息都能聽能。那每一個候審的被吿們的血液，頓時也會緊張起來，害怕着聽見自已的名字。可是事實那裏辦得到呢？終於一批批依次的傳去審了！</p>
<p>叮鈴！叮鈴！下辦公廳的鈴聲是在響了！這候審室的人聲，就由熱閙而轉到沉寂，沉寂得和蕭條的市面一般。</p>
<h3>帝國主義的安全感</h3>
<h3>記秋聲樓</h3>
<p>— 征東</p>
<p>歐陽修之秋聲賦，盡人皆知；今夏遊豫時，無意中發現秋聲樓，因記之如左。</p>
<p>秋聲樓在豫北之滑縣，距道口約十八華里，有縣道可通，故交通尚稱便利。進南門，歷數百武卽達歐陽書院；現充縣立第一小學。門前有古碑，鐫在（宋歐陽文忠公讀書處）諸字，係當地知縣所書。入内，有室焉；壁間嵌有靑石一方，鐫（秋聲賦）全文。再入，則爲秋聲樓；樓係兩層，其前扁額尚新，詢之，云係最近補題者，因前者毁於民十六之役。樓係石基，故頗堅牢。南向，有木窗三數。入内，則室中甚爲空洞，樓梯已毁，上爲藏書樓；據云，前曾有書二千餘册，而掃數毁於民十六之戰。至今片卷不存。屋爲距形，不甚寛大，現充校長室，然暑假期中，各物均經搬置一空。外岀，見屋頂满生野草，情景荒凉，其後尚有房屋數間，均充敎室，院中久經兵　，各物都遭毁滅；雖經修補，然門窗尚凌亂不齊，無可記者。故從略也。</p>
<p>院之西南方，有隋代之古刹一所，後毁於清白蓮敎之亂；現僅存古塔一座，已秃其頂，塔體傾斜行將塌倒。有司者漠視古蹟，使先代建築，日就毁滅，良可嘆也！</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>可是你們别太小看了這一座簡陋的宮殿！它在满洲人的發祥史上，也着實占着很重要的地位咧!太生對於它，也當做是一件很有紀念價値的古物看待。等我們走進去之後，伊就立刻東指西點的把一切佈置和裝飾逐件的給我們說明，而且是說得非常的流利而周到，彷彿是在這一次以前，伊已曾上這裏來過好幾次了；事實上，伊正和我們一般是初次光臨咧！可惜這時候没有一個確確實實熟悉我們這一族人的歷史的人，如其有的話，便不難立卽判别岀太后的話的眞假來。不過雖然關於射圃的故事是否眞實，我不能給伊擔保，但伊的見聞，有時候的確廣得可怕，並且有不少都是眞確的事實，這是不容一筆抺煞的！伊自已也常以博聞强記自負，凡逢伊有什麽比較不平凡的故事講給我們聽的時候，伊往往說得格外的天花亂墜，惟恐不能　動我們。這種態度，其實也是女性富於虛榮心的一種表顯，只是伊自已不曾覺得罷了！</p>
<p>在這座宮殿的裏面，每一堵墻壁上，都用各色的油漆，繪着大幅的故事畫。雖然它們的顏色已因日子過久的關係，變得很黯淡，畫工的筆法，也是非常粗陋；但輪廓還不能算糢糊，畫中人的姿態和神情，尚可表現岀十分之七八。這種壁畫是三間屋子裏都有的。太后一面在前引導着我們走，一面便把這些畫講解給我們聽，原來全是已過去的满洲的各個領袖的行獵寫眞。（二一七）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>吳稚老的潔論</h3>
<p>— 葉閒雲</p>
<p>監察委員吳稚暉先生，前天在我們鎭江省立醫政學院演講，有涉及日本人處，饒有趣味，特述之如次··我們現在是吃了日本人的大虧啦。可是他們的確有幾種優點的；譬如說愛用國貨，這還不是他們第一優點，最大的優點，是在一個潔字上。潔字的意義，是包括清潔整潔，他們是無時無地不潔的。房屋的清潔不消說，就是在村莊裏也是十分清潔，我可用一句笑話來形容，拿他們的毛厠來說；他們毛厠中坑上的木板，簡直可以蹲下去下圍棋。他們的墻是泥築的，有些還是我們中國古代的式樣，十分經濟，而布置方面也是十分整齊清楚。譬如起造一所洋房，就一切都合於洋式的，但是小至一釘之微，也是他們十足自造的國貨，所以日本是個不類尋常的民族。他們的房子，下面是泥墻，上邊是木板，甚合簡單經濟的原則。譬如你去看看他們，脫了鞋子進去，便是會客室，停一會吃飯，也便就在這裏，天晚了把在旁的橱子一翻，就可以睡覺，雖然這僅一間房子，可是要當作人家的幾種的用途，裏邊整潔得一點雜亂的東西都没有，因爲他們把没有用的東西，就一箍腦兒捺掉了。輪船上的日本西崽，凡是發現酒瓶與餅乾聽子以及什麽零雜東西，也都往海裏直抛。可是我們的廣東西崽呢，就什麽都要藏起來了。所以日本人眞是窮了，那就應了我們的一句老古話，叫做家徒四壁。反看我國的鄕村裏，三隻脚的破凳，總是不願意去丢掉，即如上海馬路上有些店家，火腿店賣剩下來的一隻腿脚，和壁　老巢的一條破舊蓆，還是高高的懸揖着，或是安安穏的平放着。</p>
<p>他們一方面固然丢掉很多的雜碎，可是另一方面他們的製造能力，也有驚人的成績，常有新製的好東西岀來，而且競爭力也非常厲害。譬如說在英國棉塲上買條被單要費七個半先令，可是從日本拿去的只要二個半先令。德國貨是人家都知道是世界上最精美的物品，日本拚命地仿造，貨色相差不遠，價値倒是便宜了幾倍。荷蘭的水利是非常發達的，所以需要很多的水管，本來是向比利時購買的，從比利時到荷蘭，等於鎭江到南京差不多是很近的。可是日本從很遠的地方裝運去，價格反而便宜，荷蘭就採用日本的水管了。你們想想看，可怕不可怕。利害不利害呢？再就上海人的外國人用老媽子來說，他們是喜歡選用日本人，或是比利時人的。一般人總以爲外國女人非常奢侈，其實大謬不然。我是在比利時住過的，他們那邊中等的人家，没有用僕人的習俗。我住的那一家的房東太太，伊的丈夫是在電氣廠做工程師，要掙到八鎊錢一星期，可是伊呢，什麽事都自已親幹着。我們的皮鞋也是伊代我們擦的。一早起來，先把人家的事情做好，然後自已理髮，造飯，看報，並摘述時事給我們聽。我們吃了飯岀去，伊就將我們房内收拾得乾乾凈凈，地毯也弄清爽，漆布也揩乾凈，門口也揩乾凈。門前的街道也要去揩拭的，伊們先用許多水冲洗清楚，再用刷子洗刷，最後用毛巾揩拭，但是已經揩拭過的毛巾，並不十分骯髒。英國女人也很勤謹的，可是伊們比不上比利時女人，所以我國要圖自存，也要追踪他們　本的站在潔字上面，才是辦法。</p>

<h3>岀席東亞高敎會議蔣劉兩代表均已返滬</h3>
<p>▲將夢麟昨晚晋京向敎部報吿</p>
<p>▲在菲參觀農村多處頗爲感動</p>
<p>▲菲人生活無問題敎育亦普及</p>
<p>赴菲岀席東亞高等敎育會議之我國代表、蔣夢麟劉湛恩兩氏、已於前日下午二時乘昃臣號輪同時返滬、（昨傳劉遲返說不確）蔣氏並於昨晚乘夜車晋京向敎部報吿經過情形後、即將返平、上海社記者昨晤蔣氏於新亞酒店、談赴菲經過甚詳、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>▲會議經過　蔣氏首談　此次會議係由菲律賓主動召集、純爲交換意見與聯絡感情、於上月十九日至二十一日舉行三天、日本亦有代表參加、會中所討論者純爲菲律濱所提、互相交換意見、並無議案、余（蔣自稱）在會中演講（中國高等敎育）、劉湛恩氏演講（中國敎育趨勢、會畢後即至附近參觀農村及敎育情形、至本月四日始乘輪離菲、</p>
<p>▲菲人生活　旋蔣氏談參觀情形謂、此次在菲參觀農村情形、頗受感動、第一點爲菲人得天獨厚、人民生活不成問題、物產豐富、糧食水果遍處皆是、稍用勞力、即可飽食、衣不城需厚、住亦簡單、旣無乞丐、又乏盜賊、在此天時地利優勝環境下之菲人、幾不信世界上有飢餓問題之事、中國即用大工程以生產、亦難及他、在菲曾問及菲地有無土匪、菲人大哭不止、於此可見一般矣、</p>
<p>▲信仰統一　第二菲律濱人信仰宗敎幾完全統一、百分之九十以上完全信仰耶穌敎、故西班牙人到菲四百年來所給予菲人者、即爲敎堂、村中每一方里即有敎堂一所、人民居室亦仿敎堂格式、其信仰之統一、實爲難能之處、不若中國各地、拜天拜地、信佛信道、宗敎信仰之絶不一致也、</p>
<p>▲敎育普及　第三菲律濱敎育幾已普及、三分之二以上的人民俱入學校、故美人治菲三十五年來所給予菲人者、即爲學校、每一村莊必有學校一所、其學校之設備及建築式樣、遵照政府規定、完全一律、當美人第一次去菲時、由美帶往小學敎員一千人、及今各學校敎員大半盡係菲人、其對於普及敎育認爲最注重之工作、</p>
<p>▲敎費情形　菲律濱敎育之所以普及、首在美人之整理財政、中央政府以百分之四十充敎育費、省以百分之四十至六十充敎育費、地方（稱市）則以中央與省之敎育費全數中之三分之一、補充之故菲地敎育分中央敎育、省敎育市敎育三種、其經費之充足、爲中國所不及、其次菲地對鄕村敎育尤爲重視、中國鄕村敎師平均生活費每人僅九元、都市則較高、菲地則完全以人材分配、不依鄕村與都市爲標準、有時鄕村敎師之生活費較都市敎師爲高、此其特點、且各地敎員互相調用、不以本籍敎師充任、使言語逐漸統一、可减少地域觀念、其用語完全英語、土話亦漸减少、</p>
<p>▲華僑生活　菲地華僑約有十萬左右、大半經營商業小商業如米廠、肥皂·雜貨·等、百分之八十操在華人之手、但此輩華人一切生活習慣已爲同化、中國自明正德萬歷年間已入菲島、但除飲食以外未將他種文化帶去、且菲律濱非軟弱的民族、頗有組織、限制華人移民、故菲島華人不若臺灣及其他南洋羣島之多、總之菲律濱爲太洋中最有生氣之民族、前途未可限量也、</p>

<p>(四)私立中華獻曲職業學校辦理未久、能岀台表演之獻劇、已有三百餘齣、成績可觀、對於學生之清潔整齊、亦能注意、行政組織、尚有條理、惟完全學習舊戲、敎員係劇界藝員、敎學方法亦多陳舊、練習武工、往往妨碍小學生之身、心發育、應加注意、且戲劇關係社會敎育甚鉅、應特别注重戲劇改良、以謀進步、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>俗物主義</h3>
<p>高爾基有一篇有名的作品，呌做（鷹之歌），寫一隻鷹帶着對自由，對光明的熱望，飛向天上去，在半空中落下來，恰恰落在一條草蛇躺着的地方。胸膛戳破了，羽毛沾着血，但勇敢的鷹却一點也不懊悔，他懂得一戰鬥的光榮）。對潮潮的，暖暖的穴中生活完全满足的草蛇是不會了解鷹的勇敢的行爲的。他嘲笑鷹的胡閙。旣而他又想道··（鷹那麽想上天，一定天空的生活是快活的。）於是他打算親自飛上天去看個明白，忘却了（凡是天生着用肚子爬的東西是不能飛的）。他把身子向空中一射，便跌到石巖上的蛇却以爲自已已經飛上過天，看見過天空了。他大笑着說··（原來飛上天去的滋味就是你得跌下來的意思。）於是他愈加覺得那些拼命想飛上天去的鳥的（可笑），他們的（慾望的痴狂），他們的（不適於實際生活），而得意洋洋地們自已的身子盤在石巖上。</p>
<p>這條（聰明的）蛇眞是俗物主義（Ｐhilisinism)的最好的標本。安於自已的（潮潮的，暖暖的）生活，而嘲笑那些爲自由和光明而死的人們爲（可笑），爲（痴狂）；或是自已還没有正式參與過戰鬥，便聲言（脫離戰壕），仍舊回到自已的（潮潮的，暖暖的）老巢去！這些便是俗物們的行徑。他們是天生着用肚子爬的東西，在他們身上找不岀飛躍的精神。高爾基說俗物主義代表着寄生者層，他們是不事生產而專門消費的。他們宣傳最小抵抗的個人成長的哲學，在兩種力量之間尋求多少安定的均衡。羨望，貪欲慾，俗惡的Ｇossip，互相誹謗···這些便都是俗物主義的表現。</p>
<p>高爾基本人的偉大就在他是俗物主義的最澈底的反對者。他初期作品中的愛自由的勇敢的浮浪人，無家者、，都是作爲和灰色的俗物恰相對立的存在，而放射永遠不滅的光芒。凡是優秀的作家對於市民層的微温，小氣，卑鄙，庸俗，幾乎都是抱着無限的輕蔑與與憎惡的。（　市民層的憎惡是道德的第一步，）保守的福禄貝爾也不能不這樣說。戈蒂葉曾以幻想的服裝和長髮來和市民的庸俗對抗，駡市民層（僅拜倒於五法郎的金幣，除保存自已的皮衣以外無其他理想）。普希金惱於社會上層的流俗苟且，而寫了下面這樣的激怒的詩句··</p>
<p>（以愛爲羞恥，把思想抛掉，</p>
<p>却自獻身買賣，</p>
<p>叩頭於偶像之前，</p>
<p>希冀黃金和鎖。）</p>
<p>但是作家自身雖然痛恨自已階層的庸俗，却不能同意於俗物主義的根源之斷絶，結果自已也（同乎流俗）了。戈蒂葉不用說，就是普希金後來也不能不和自已所鄙視的俗物們妥恊，把（自由意志的抒情詩的短劍）放回了（金黃色的劍鞘），刺到了俗物主義的心臓，無論怎樣也不肯住手的，在文學史上，僅高爾基一人而已。</p>
<p>偉大如哥德也不能免於（狹量的俗物）之譏。哥德在（浮士德）裏表現了對環境的不满，對偉大事業的追求，想要改變生活的努力。但他有時却變成非常保守。他曾對愛克曼（Ｅckermann)說··</p>
<p>（現在關於貴族政治和民主政治談得太多了··但這個問題在我們年靑時是非常簡單的，那時我們旣没看財產，也不能珍重牠們的價値，所以我們是民主主義者。但是假如我們在長期的生活中抓取了一些財產的時候，那我們就必須使牠安全，不祇是爲了我們自已，而且也爲了我们的子孫，他們是將要繼承我們的財產的。所以到了老年我們都變成了貴族主義者，不管我們靑年時抱有怎樣的見解。）</p>
<p>讀了這段話，我們幾乎不能相信這是岀於一個（傲慢的，侮蔑世俗的天才）之口爲甚麽哥德也是這樣一個俗物呢。這除了在他是佛蘭克府市會議員的規規矩矩的大少爺，而自已又是淮瑪爾的大臣，這個事實上面尋求解釋以外，再找不岀旁的原因來了。</p>
<h3>湖的話</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>（一）大明湖</p>
<p>也許因爲是冬季，大明湖給我的印象，却並不如所揣想的或從書上看來的那麽有趣，那麽好；整個的湖面，已被許多小隄，切成田畝似的水塘了，－－大約是利用來在春夏天栽種蒲菜一類的植物了吧。進去遊玩歷下亭等地的畫舫，都只得沿着小河似的水道而行，至於（扁舟容與）及（縱一葦之所如）那種自由浮泛的興趣，在這兒的湖上，當然是不能十分享有的了。而且湖中縱橫的小隄，又全不能供人行走，弗高興坐畫舫以遊的人，那就祇能在湖口望望而已。</p>
<p>湖上没有什麽遊人，畫舫和遊艇，都冷落地停在湖口，讓雪堆上。空際三五飛鷹，對着湖面，展翅盤旋，久久不去，幾隻撈取枯葦的小船，緩緩地蕩漾在遠處水塘中，才算點破了一些兒沉悶的靜寂。</p>
<p>湖中有歷下亭北極閣鐵公祠等等古蹟名勝，足供遊人的觀感，但却引不起我們的興味，正如登千佛山而不喜歡逛廟宇一樣。因爲我們覺得飛泉瀑布連山，大野，無論如何，是比重樓疊閣的皇宮，更要令人愛慕些。</p>
<p>然而，在湖上看千佛山却是極好的。你想，在景物蕭索的湖中，遊得乏味的時候，驀地抬起頭來，看見戴雪的斜峯，銀燦地顯在天半，誰又不頓然精神飛越呢？不過，這却不是大明湖本身具有的佳處呵。</p>
<p>也許在春夏天，楊柳拂在隄上，荷花開在湖中，景色才是最美的吧。</p>
<p>（二）大光湖</p>
<p>遊了大明湖，却越發使我懐憶起仰光的大光湖來了，雖然隄上没有垂過柳樹，湖中没有開過荷花，但那長年不凋的緑蔭，和那一望明澈的湖水，却是無時無刻不令人感到愉快。湖的週遭，繞着椰子成蔭的柏油馬路，東西北三面，更鑲有緑意葱蘢的灌木林子，湖心且點綴有好些淺草如氈的斜坡，因此，在湖上或坐或臥或散步，都是極其宜人的。</p>
<p>每當通黃的落日，垂到大金塔腰邊的時候，西方的白衣士女，便三三兩兩，競舟湖上；而穿紅着緑的歐洲小孩，也散路在斜坡上面，玩着多種遊戲。約莫在每禮拜六的下午，還有市政府的音樂隊，排在湖心亭邊，吹奏着各樣娱人的歌曲。但這些並不是使我高興大光湖的地方，我所喜歡的，是那些時而繞在湖濱時而穿進林子的幽靜沙路，可以將我終年藏在皮鞋裏行走的足，愜意地裸了岀來，作着爽快的鄕下人的散步；或是躺在少人到的林下草地上，讓宜人的樹色，讓媚人的湖光，慢慢地來供養。</p>
<p>在湖上，没有小販的影子，没有酒肆茶店的點缀，更没有像大明湖携帶酒食的畫舫，一切都覺得和自然越發親近，而遊人的精神，也就比較來得新鮮和清爽些了。並且早晚林裏飛鳴着熱帶國度的烏鴉，湖旁咆哮着動物園裏的獅虎，便更加像是處在深山老林一樣。這一點也是使我不易忘去大光湖的。</p>
<h3>失樂園（續完）</h3>
<p>鄕村中是荒凉的，猶其冬春兩季的夜間，犬昏鴉間或嗚吠兩聲，宜增加落漠的况味。可是孩子們却能驅除這岺寂，假如鄕村可以比作水墨畫，孩子的呼聲確給添上一抺生氣。</p>
<p>自然孩子們之所以玩耍並非爲點綴村坊冷落的門面，他們還没學會遮掩醜惡。他們只知道娱樂，這些娱樂究竟給於多少好處，也從不計及，他們只任情耍着，不單忘記晚歸，且亦（忘我）了，所以直至夜深塲上還閙嚷嚷，非等大人三番幾次催促是不願散塲的。</p>
<p>娱樂也是一種敎育，近來已惹起人們注意，上述鄕俚的各種玩法究有多大價値，我不曾作過估計，但和學校裏規定的一比，也不遜色在那裏，太簡單也是事實</p>
<p>這些簡單的耍法在敎育家看來也許是原始的，野蠻，不合理，然而暫且也没有辦法。雖然只是一羣（無法無天）的野孩子，也决非不會文明，無如社會給他們的限制太多了，卽併這野蠻的玩法也要失去，豈不是大可哀哉了嗎。</p>
<p>我的失去樂園是因爲家中還有幾個錢，父親送我進學校，隨後他故去了，自已也到了成年，便不得不按一般成年人那樣去生活，所以是極其平常的。倘若仍跑到那樂園的光塲上，參進那小小的隊伍中去，縱然是月下的夜間，恐怕也要引起不平常的反響了。我已經不是孩子。不過，每逢冬春的晚上總禁不起想像幼年時一切塲上的情形，那怕中間有着多少距離，對樂園依舊向往着的。有時坐下來好久，明明對着紙壁，却看見一羣孩子在捉捕，在逃避，在吵在閙，而且連唿哨也聽見了，其間便來了人生不可免的輕飄飄的哀傷；漸漸和孩子離開了！</p>
<p>前年偶爾因着變故回到家裏，第一個使我想起的便是禾塲上的樂園。没來也想起過，就是那片小小的樂土上，也不知演過多少小小的喜劇同悲劇，然而舊情所繫，忘他不下的。</p>
<p>那是一個初冬的夜晚，天氣尚不很冷，一地好月亮，連樹木也都照得像童話中才應有的；想來塲上一定大熱閙，該藉以温一温舊夢了罷。可是當我走到去禾塲的路上時，却不能不立住了，塲依舊很平坦整潔，月光依舊冰瑩通亮，可是一個人影也看不見；連吵閙聲，唿哨聲像一起被冷然的月光掃去了。街上呢，也看不見有人似的東西活動，只有一隻狗垂倒了頭，拖着尾巴慢慢走着，嘴裏發岀咳嗽聲。但决不是魚骨卡在嗓子裏。我立了好久，也决不是賞月，只是無端端的站着，讓凉風吹拂着臉。許是惘然了罷。可是那些（無有家敎）的孩子呢，當然不會絶種的，那末有事情？也不致都那麽凑巧。然而第二天事情却弄明白了。我在土穀廟前看見一個孩子，大約十一二歲光景，瘦小身量，面容枯槁，枯槁得有幾分像是蒼老。是一個孩子也决不會錯的。可是這孩子的站相把我吸住了。他立着，岀左脚，是一個（稍息）的姿勢，左臂却橫欄在胸前，托住右肘節，右肘節以上屈上去，食中兩指間夾着一隻本地造的捲烟，他昻首正向野外眺望，邊悠然吸着烟。雖然他並不留神四近，然而任誰也會感動的罷，也許會吃驚，他是一個流氓，一個盼望着故土的水手，可是不更像一個大人嗎</p>
<p>暴力起初還只及於大人，孩子還不過間接受到影響，漸漸大人還不够塡满那貪婪的嘴巴呢，這惡毒的網也就捕羅起孩子。他們被挖去天眞，逼着不得負起成人的任務，不得不担起成年人的憂愁，被軋去一切快樂，本來還只是該嘻戲的孩童，却已經拿起烟捲像一個成人在抽了，關於這點尚無人提及；我們的（天才）呢？哪裏去了!</p>
<p>這話離我當孩時止不過八九功夫，似乎不算怎樣長久，然而八九年間已有過這番大變動，孩子們是縱然那樣不大高明的樂園也一併失去了。現在又是將近三年，孩子們怎樣了呢，誰知道？</p>
<h3>生活</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>生活應該是探險，並不輕鬆，像夢裏蕩颺；各人爬着向生之塔尖，爬乏力的在中途跌傷。</p>
<p>心血汗力的凝造，生活是推一架輪；到精力像機油的乾了，一摔手，輪子再不能向前推進。</p>
<h3>蒼蠅（八）</h3>
<p>— 意Pirandello作席滌塵譯</p>
<p>牠去歇在耐利的臉頰上。從他臉頰上，現在慢慢地，不過兩挺，就跑向下巴，直到了剃刀所割破的所在，而貪饞地留在那裏了。</p>
<p>柴魯緊切地，專心地瞧牠在那裏，瞧了好一會，然後顯着抑塞住的困苦，用一種空洞的聲音問道··</p>
<p>（會得是隻蒼蠅？）</p>
<p>（一隻蒼蠅？爲什麽不可以？）醫生回答。柴魯就不再說什麽；他繼續凝視着蒼蠅。耐利彷彿給醫生的活麻木了知覺，也不將牠揮去。柴魯不睬醫生，但他心裏歡喜，這麽一說，就如此吸引了他表兄弟的注意，至於木立如石，以致不讓他注意下巴上那個蒼蠅的輕弄。</p>
<p>啊！假使就是這一隻呀！那他们當眞會，淘結婚了！他心頭爲一種深沉的嫉忌所襲種對他年輕貌美的表兄弟之盲目，兇狠的妒忌，對於耐利，人生依舊依充满了希望，而另一方面生命對他柴魯是無望了－</p>
<p>突然之間，耐利彷彿終於覺得自已被叮，揚起手來趕去蒼蠅，並用他的手指，搖摸他下巴上的小裂口起來。他轉向柴魯，見他怪異的一笑現開了那對可怕的嘴唇，有　一些倉皇失措。他們相對緊視了一會。於是柴魯幾乎並不想說而說道··</p>
<p>（蒼蠅－）</p>
<p>耐利聽不明白，走近一些俯耳傾聽。</p>
<p>（你說什麽？）（蒼蠅－）他重說一遍。（那一隻？在那裏？）耐利心悸，一邊望着醫生，一邊追究道。</p>
<p>（就在你自已抓破的所在。確實無疑。）柴魯說道。耐利把他下巴的裂口給醫生看。</p>
<p>（那地方又沾染了什麽？怪癢的······）</p>
<p>醫生望着那裂口，蹙緊了眉毛；於是，好像要仔細看一看，領他到馬棚外面去。薩羅跟着他。</p>
<p>那什麽事情又發生了？柴魯等着，等了許久時候，心中帶了一種抓緊住的不安。他聽得人在外面亂轟轟轟地說話，突然薩羅又狂暴地進了馬棚，抓了騾子，竟頭也不回的岀去，哭道</p>
<p>（㗒，我可憐的小耐利！㗒，我可憐的小耐利！）</p>
<p>那末，這是眞的了？他們就這樣子丢下他在這裏像個狗子一般地？他竭力撑起身來，喊了兩聲（薩羅！薩羅！）</p>
<p>沉寂無聲。外面無人。他就不再撑起，落回躺着的姿勢；他開始咕嚕了一下，爲的是不要　聽那四野的沉寂，這使他害怕。突然他以爲做了夢了，在發熱中受了夢魔；可是，一再回向牆，他又看見那隻蒼蠅。</p>
<p>牠在那裏。</p>
<p>一時把牠那小小的吸嗍器官呼岀又吸入，一時又敏捷地洗洗牠的細腿，互相搓搓，彷彿满意了。（完）</p>

<h3>證劵迫近廢歷年關債市寂寞乏精采</h3>
<p>（除掉期與了結交易外絶少新買賣）</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、趨勢居然已有漸入盤旋之象、洋拆祇做四角、比前又鬆八分、而市價并不因此興奮、買户并不踴躍、大户則續有賣岀、似此殊不易驟見良好、因人氣懈怠、市面闌珊、除了結及掉期交易外、新買賣甚少成交、洋拆已鬆、而人心不振、環境雖佳、而空頭不補、漲則無力、跌亦不易、故前途恐不免作一度盤旋矣、昨日上午開盤、洋拆驟縮、散户進胃不弱、交易則并不踴躍、賣户較稀、市價上騰、比前續漲一二角至四角左右、尾列比較爲弱、次盤二十一及四十八號賣岀裁兵極湧、市價頓被壓小、趨勢由高而低、風氣驟變、人心亦爲人帶虛、此後乃一致回跌、多者小半元左右、頭盤所漲、跌落無餘、市上亦并無謠言、可見銀根表面雖稍見鬆退、大空不補、散户購買力、亦漸感满足、市價亦無由上騰、午後形勢、尤爲混沌、交易亦極爲清閒、多數觀望、開盤平穏、多數好一二角、少數小五分一角、收盤大都均小一角左右、陰歷年關將近、似有收縮之象、市價結果、多數小五分一角至三角、有二三種尚略好五分一角、成交總數、計共九百五十二萬二千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紗花日紗商空額掉期</h3>
<p>標紗成交額漸減少</p>
<p>紗市平穏、形勢異常渙散、市塲上交易益覺冷澹、因商人習慣難改、轉瞬廢歷年關將届、對於營業範團漸漸縮小、故買賣兩方、均持看望態度、拍開黑板甚多、市盤升降愈微、惟日商之空額、業已開始掉期矣、</p>
<p>（金鷄靜堅）標紗前市開盤即漲、市氣顯現良好之狀、因美棉轉漲、吳某在本月份仍有收貨之舉、致人心尤穏、但塲中交易異常清寂、多空大户束手不動、結果各月均漲一·二·五·角、午後開盤、聞現紗生意冷靜、但行情仍昻、日商在本月抵進、放岀遠月、作掉期之舉、各月又漲三·四·五·角、查賣岀均昶四百五十包、大昶四百包、愼記五百包、源大四百包、恒德四百包、長豐三百包、買進錦昌一千二百五十包、賡豐九百包、通記三百包、元一二百包、大福二百包、　日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>棉花稍轉機</h3>
<p>棉市又現回蘇之狀、因美印棉轉漲、而標金亦漲、匯兌趨縮、人心安穏、但多空兩方皆束手不動、故成交殊覺寥落、現棉廠需雖無大批交易、然零星生意、尚絡繹不絶云、</p>
<p>（鄭標近遠各好一角）標花前市開盤、市况平定、因上日謠言、紗廠停工之風說完全子虛、而印美棉市一致轉漲、金市續堅、故人心回振、不若上日之疲、浮空稍有抵補、結果各月均漲五分至一角、午後聞英廠對於現棉活動採辦、且有巨大額量之說、市情尤緊昻一步、但拍至收盤略疲、結果各月又漲五分、查賣岀益裕五百擔、瑞大一千三百擔、長豐一千八百擔、買進錦昌一千九百擔、源興昌一千七百擔、均昶八百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>美棉收前轉勢</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息不佳、多頭了頭、及孟買帮售岀、各月跌二至四磅音、其後同業買進、證劵及麥市有力、賣户减少、市况回堅、新買賣不多、同業等候華盛頓方面之發展、收盤前同業及外商買進、空户抵補、華爾街有力、故收盤市况、非常堅昻、計現貨沣十磅音、期貨漲五至九磅音、（預算咨文雖證實有膨脹之可能、棉市無甚影響、據交易所估計、去年一月份全世界棉花消費爲二、一三三、○○○包、上年同期爲二、一五○、○○○包）、英棉市况不振、現貨跌二點、期貨跌四點、印棉始因多頭操業者買進而漲、後因經紀商及少數散户套賣而回、計平果爾漲二角半、奥姆辣及白羅溪均漲一羅比、原電錄左、（七日電）</p>

<h3>糧食標準粉頻有抽裝</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市平穏、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好一三角不等、坎拿大好八分零、當開價時、各月份交易已轉清淡、惟以各廠抛碼、亦轉寂寞、業外之浮空、反思抵補、本月份則以北路客銷路絡、標準粉頻有抽裝、是以人心帶緊、遠期亦因岀户甚寂、同趨穏固、迨至下午開盤、本月份以實銷仍活、喊價步堅、遠期因業外略進、步步高昻、但廢歷結賬又近、客户交易、均多結果、故此後交易、當須暫寂也、結果本月份好一分七釐半、二月份好二分、三月份好二分二釐半、四月份好二分、五月份好一分七釐半、六月份好二分七釐半云、</p>
<h3>期麥後市忽起抵空</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、均轉俏利、以洋麥報價、續好八分至一三角左右不等、當開價時、本月份買賣、叫價未能接近、完全空拍、遠期因洋麥報漲、兼之日來現麥兜售、已見停止、人心望好、二三月份好三四分不等、迨至下午開盤、本月份因空户抵補、開價即好四分、後則盤旋、遠期交易尚暢、價與上午相仿、現麥市情形、終須視洋麥爲轉移也、結果本月份好四分、二月份好六分、三月份好四分、現麥市面、已擯多日、昨因天雨、廠胃平平、中次貨喊低二三分、開山東麥四元零五分、瑤灣宿遷麥四元另三分、次一分、嚮水口麥三元九角半、由華豐申大阜豐去一千二百餘包云、</p>

<h3>河米天雨喊漲聲浪高</h3>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源與昨相仿、共到三十餘號、（貨共近六千石）作客雨阻、形勢清寂、惟人心因雨反堅、售方頗有喊高之聲、各厚粳到源有限、加上尺奇、各晚稻以來貨較多、平平局面、然亦有增起數分角許者、杜尖以兩朝缺貨、頗有秀色、洋尖仍以乏貨無市、陰變元無甚榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下内地各貨到頭十餘號、市銷方面、各色平常、市色平常、市價白粳客尖變陰元價形均屬定局、早薄稻堅定、</p>
<h3>廣東又裝來秈米兩船</h3>
<p>－洋米日昨又見平疲－</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、因到存兩充、除整批之外、零星來貨亦復源源不絶、故昨市又落、期洋米昨日新交易以產價不鬆、洋商不肯低脫、全市只開一月份西貢五百噸、由顺全隆抛岀、價爲四元八角、雖貨品不同、然亦降小六七分矣、三四月份未有抛岀、故回籠貨尚能支站、但交易不多、如今明洋行再抛、或須遂步下降也、現洋米開岀暹邏西貢各米三千八百包、價均各小五分以上、客秈以到存較少、產地昻站、故市面比洋米穏定、全市由本街内地辦去四千一百七十包、</p>
<p>廣東秈米月前到申一批、因有洋米混充嫌疑、曾起一度糾紛、近南市米行續運二批到申、由太古輪浙江江蘇船抵埠、共計一萬二千多包、高貨開十一元七角、低次降至十元○七角、統由米商直接配與米店、並非在公會上公開售岀云、</p>

<h3>北黑鐵路的完成</h3>
<p>— 胡仁木</p>
<p>前日路透哈爾濱電、給我們一個値得注意的消息、讀，消息是說，（北黑鐵路）已經完成。</p>
<p>打開東北地圖，在黑龍江省呼海鐵路的北端海倫近旁，可以讓我們發現有一個小米粒子一般大的黑點，這是北安鎭，也就是北黑鐵路的起點，大黑河是終點。</p>
<p>北黑鐵路値得我們注意的地方在那裏？它本身的重要性，可以說，絶對不像路透電報所謂，以後沿路產麥，運銷有路，且爲發展北部黑龍江荒凉地帶的幹綫，（大意如此）這，雖然是言之有理，是說得岀口的，但是，筆者認爲它値得我们注意的地方應該是屬於軍事方面的！</p>
<p>我們知道，自從日本帝國主義强佔去東四省以後，對於東北各項建設，特别是軍事方面的建設，可說是拚力在幹着，這裏面，包含鐵路，汽車路的建設，内河航路的開拓的發展航空網。鐵路建設是最著者，北黑鐵路不過是其中之而已。</p>
<p>可是，北黑鐵路所負使命確是重大的。從日本海西岸朝鮮的羅津港（這裏是日本認爲控制蘇聯海參崴港的要地）起，鐵路越過圖們江，接着吉會鐵路（吉林至會寗），在拉法站又聯上今秋完成的拉濱路（拉法站到哈爾濱）這是從朝鮮本部進迫哈爾濱距離最短的一條路綫，較之由新義州經安東由安奉路轉南满路再轉哈長綫而達哈爾濱，或是由吉會路經吉林轉吉長路再折入哈長綫而達哈爾濱，是没有比這條路再短的。哈爾濱是北满重鎭，日本帝國主義無論對满（？）對　在軍事上都是必須保有的要地。拉濱路由哈爾濱越江，接　　　　　　黑路，於是，一條直綫般的爬蟲，在吉黑兩省的地圖上岀現了，這就是說，從朝鮮的羅津港到黑龍江的大黑河，往來非常便利，自然軍運上也有同等的方便處。年來，日甚一日。日本帝國主義在取着對蘇步步進攻的陣略，這條路就是截斷蘇俄西伯利亞鐵路的金鉸剪。大黑河的對面是海蘭泡，從這裏再向前衝，就是西伯利亞鐵道了。</p>
<p>一句話，北黑鐵路的完成，使我們値得注意的，就是更顯明地暴露岀日本對蘇軍事的更進一層，將來一層層的前進，到了無法解决時，戰爭自然要爆發了。這條鐵路那時就完成了它的使命。</p>
<h3>萬麵</h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>太陽剛從地平綫下爬岀來，天氣已是熱得呌人發悶，非提着水桶到河邊去冲凉不可了。</p>
<p>據老番客（一般人習慣地都認暹羅和南洋羣島爲番邦，因此，到那兒去的都稱爲番客。）長春伯的經騐·一到大暑天，就得在太陽還没有爬岀來的早晨，提着水桶到河邊去冲凉，這樣，可以使心身凉爽，消却病魔的糾纒的。雖則長春伯已成爲老番客了，在萬麵度過三十餘年悠長的時間，然而，每逢大暑天，他還是照樣地舉行着。</p>
<p>（啊，天氣眞是熱得了不得呵！）</p>
<p>一清早，椰子樹下鷄籠裏的雄鷄把長春伯呌醒起來，習慣地，他揉一揉惺忪的睡眼，吐岀這句唸慣了的爛調子，然後，獨個兒提了水桶，踽踽地走到河邊去了。</p>
<p>天空靑碧得没有一絲兒輕飄飄的浮雲，澄清得像一片碧玉似的蓋在頭頂上。遠遠地望去，在那列用熱帶所特有的植物底葉子蓋成的矮屋背後的一片林木，還可以清清楚楚地把樹幹兒辦别岀來，小鳥兒離了巢林吱吱喳喳地飛着。長春伯走到木橋上，吸了一口清新的長氣，頓時覺得胸膛裏無限的寛適，嘴邊兒浮着自然的淺笑。然而當地他瞧見橋下含着土泥黃濁的洪水，和木橋那邊的那所規模宏大的米舖，那高岀屋頂的巨大的烟囱，深山裏荒塔似的沉寂靜靜地躺着，烟囱口站立着幾隻小鳥兒，再不會吐岀團團而又裊裊的黑烟來。於是長春伯的心裏，陡然間好像給毒蛇咬了一口般的難過，眉　尖緊緊地鎖着，臉孔遮蓋着一朶暗澹的愁雲。</p>
<p>（又是洪水時期了！）輕微的氣息從他的口裏噓岀來，腦袋搖幌幌地，像臨風的楊柳般，嘆息着。</p>
<p>三十幾年前，在長春伯的心裏，以爲暹羅這番邦直到處都是金子造成的　　要能够到番邦去做番客，那末，就可以任意自已的慾望，把金子裝到荷包裏去。於是，他勇敢地離開了家園搭着紅頭船，在大海中飄流了二個多，嘗盡了千辛萬苦，才到暹羅來。可是，暹羅那裏有如長春伯腦子裏所幻想，隨處隨地都是金子呢？當他走上暹羅岸的時候、他終於失望地把這個拾金子的念頭打得粉碎了。然而由於長春伯的刻苦努力、和幾年來生意的顺手、他也能够成家立業，在萬麵開創一家規模宏大的米舖，使一般人對他起了羨慕，稱讚他能幹，恭賀他發財了。</p>
<p>長春伯在木橋上望着巨大的烟囱岀了一會神，想起過去幾年前米舖的生意正在旺盛的時候，不分白天還是黑夜，這高入雲霄的烟囱，連續不停地吐岀一縷縷裊裊的黑烟來，機器聲軋軋的像音樂般有節奏得多麽悅人！每年一到洪水時期，山巴的粟穗割了之後，趁着洪水的高漲沿着湄南河的支流一，載一載連成一串地運到萬麵他的米舖來。（座山，（在暹羅一般人對老板都稱）（座山）），靠着你的福氣，今年的年情是多麽好！粟粒給成得多麽肥大！哈哈······）紅着嘴唇黑着牙齒满口嚼着栳葉的土番，堆着笑臉地說着。於是，工人們忙於把黃金似的粟粒搬運到機器間去，礱岀白得發亮的白米來。</p>
<p>可是幾年來因爲星加坡的樹膠業的不景氣，相繼地辭退了工人，把膠廠收歇了，這使長春伯失了傾銷白米的市塲，同時，别的地方又找不到岀路，且同業又互相競爭得厲害，在這種種壓迫之下，於是，他宣吿破產了。</p>
<p>當長春伯瞧見橋下黃濁的洪水，和高入雲霄靜靜地聳立着的巨大的烟囱，長春伯想起幾年前的光榮，耳朶裏還隠約地存留着那些紅嘴唇的土人，迎着笑臉地說着··（托座山的福）的話，他心坎裏就好像給毒蛇咬住一口般的痛苦，難過！</p>
<h3>農塲小景</h3>
<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>新穀登塲了。我推開臥室的窗，向田野望去，每一個農塲上都堆满着那樣纍纍然黃金般的穀穗。夏天裏二個多月没有下雨，莊稼人挨聲嘆氣拼命車水，一歲的希望幾乎完全抛在腦後，可是却收得了岀乎意外的收穫，許多臘像似的黃面上重展開了難得笑容－從心的深處發岀來的笑容。</p>
<p>太陽剛從東方探起頭來，莊稼人已吃過了早飯，把打稻的床搬到農塲上來，開始做他們的打稻工作。</p>
<p>我好奇的踅岀門來，站在塲角瞧着。</p>
<p>隔宿的露水，被陽光蒸發了從稻束上冒着水氣，和他們呼吸岀來的空氣在寒風中打成一片。那個年老的爸爸，我們不能從他的容貌上估量他的年紀了，奮勇地用稻草扣緊了破舊的棉絮襖，兩個腿鐵柱似的並着稻床的後脚，從兒子手中授過每一束垂着穀穗的稻束，雙手舉過頭頂，身一灣，用力地向稻床上甩着。兩三摔之後，稻束上的穀穗，已满满地舖在稻床下了。</p>
<p>那個餘賸的稻束他隨手抛在塲角裏。等刻工作完畢之後，他們把這許多稻束疊成一個柴堆，作爲燃料；也有用小船運到城裏去販賣博一點薄利，自家反到附近去找樹枝落葉煮飯。</p>
<p>在塲的另一角，有三根晒衣竹竿交叉着，像隊伍中休息時候三枝步槍交叉着一樣，一個米篩由麻索繫在交叉點。媽媽雙手把着米篩的邊緣，兩腿一前一後站着，孩子們把稻床下的新穀搬到米篩裏，她就用力搖動米篩，　粒從篩眼中漏到底下預備着的拷　中，（在的貯米器具）而稻屑都留在米篩中。這樣他們把新穀藏到米窩中去，到新春米價高漲的時候糶岀去。</p>
<p>但是最近幾年的天災人禍，莊稼人的米窩中已三年不見米屑了。新穀上塲，有時不够還租；卽是好一點的年成，許多債户逼着他們把新穀最低廉的價格糶岀去。－這是米商及大佃主的操縱手段，到年底米價總是最賤的時期，開了春，把米價抬高，他們囤積着的米糧就獲得很大的利益；而那些被剥削的莊稼人在那時候反以高價去買他們上年辛勤種岀來的白米。</p>
<p>今年雖然經過奇特的大旱，然而收成意外的好，附近農塲上重展開了一幅田家樂；壯的工作着，老的曬太陽，孩子也一刻没有停息做一些瑣碎的事情，屋檐上小麻雀在塲角走着短步喙食米粒，牠們似乎歡欣今年可以過一個舒適的冬天。</p>
<p>日中午了，工作已完了大半，莊稼人用袖管拭去額角上的汗珠，就蹲在塲上吃午飯。這時候他們開始發現站在塲角的我，莊稼人是挺和氣的，我們時常見面的特别倒了杯茶招呼我，於是我也加入他們歡樂的團體中閑談起來。</p>
<p>（今年收成好啊！）我這樣開了塲。</p>
<p>（靠天老爺的福！）那個年老的爸爸含着满口飯說；一二個多月日夜車水，再像往年的收成，没有人種田啦···）</p>
<p>一倒底還是好了倉間裏，（田主）收成一好，米價就漲了，明年恐怕再要吃貴米呢！）媽媽挿嘴說，這老婦人又愁苦起來。</p>
<p>（種田人眞苦哩！）年老的爸爸也嘆了口氣，（說起來今年好收成，但是往年欠的租呢？一頭牛也賣了，再這樣三年好收成，恐怕也還不了一輩子的債）！</p>
<p>（命苦說什麽呢！）老祖母嚕咕着；（我過來的時起，每年米窩堆着的是米，還了租，一年吃用，還可以多兩捲（每捲五十元）大洋鈿，現在這付老骨頭倒要吃苦了！）</p>
<p>孩子們捧了飯碗在塲角趕麻雀，這羣天眞的孩子是否知道將要繼續他們爸爸的命運！還不了的一輩子債要壓在這一代莊稼人的肩頭上了！</p>
<h3>在楊家宅的路上</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>馬路的經和緯交叉着組成了繁複的一面圖案。</p>
<p>眞的，那模型是一張網子，網着了這整個的都會，網着了這個高高低低地房子，也網着了那色種不同的人類。</p>
<p>知道麽？不同的，不只在人的色種上。言語習俗和環境上的差異，也常常他能使人與人之間不相同的，也常常地能改造一個人心性的。</p>
<p>近來，大槪是傷感的調子太多了，我想，每逢走到金神父路的底端，不，或者卽使想到的時候，不禁的，心頭總要動幾下子，跟着，也不禁的會想着，（這小鳥，她是飛遠了呵！）</p>
<p>於是，心頭更激烈的閙上一陣子，不是麽？（天涯一角留澹澹，心連兩地正殷殷）；這握别的話，眞被你猜着了，正是寫絲着我現時的景象呵！</p>
<p>本來，大家都正年靑，因不着擺岀道學的面孔，因爲這年靑是一朶可愛的花，牠是値得寳貴的，顧惜的。雖說那上面長着刺，會刺破人的手，淌着鮮紅的血液，然而，正因爲這樣，也愈有可愛的價値存在。</p>
<p>日子，不知道爲什麽要　跑得這麽快，自從她飛到沉暮的古國，已經是兩個多月了。自然，那古國是有牠特殊的風趣的··澄黃的沙子，矮子的院牆，齊楚的柳岸，曠敝的麥田，還有零零落落地果樹，······一切，都會使她歡喜的。她願意接近牠們，和牠們連成伙伴。</p>
<p>據說，人的想像畢竟不能完全如願的，有的時候，畢竟還要被事實所打破的。她又那裏想得到呢？竟這樣短從的又回來了，又回到這繁囂而厭惡的都會。</p>
<p>爲了要保持她原有的意見，於是，假寓在都市的外園。</p>
<p>一個晴和的下午，携着一份特有心情，離開了都會的密網，跨上那鄕村的路。</p>
<p>在鄕村，另具着一番情味的，路窄窄地一條，房子，可以說是道地的國產，實在，南國的風光倒底是不同的，那已經衰枯了的草野，却仍在潛埋着種生命的活力，初冬的風，雖則尖利，</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>但很緩和，太陽的温度好像也更密切了點。人，也換樣子，樸厚的神情會使你疑心到已另外的一個世界。</p>
<p>照舊的，她還是那麽快活，像社會上的善與惡與她毫無關連似的。</p>
<p>（這裏，你覺得好麽）？她笑着，（對了，來到這裏，你也應該鑒賞一下我們的大馬路的）。那態度同小鳥一樣。</p>
<p>緩緩地，在楊家宅的路上走着，許多的眼睛緊釘在我們身上。</p>
<p>楊家宅，一個小的鎭市，有二百多户人家，一條穿心的石板路横貫在全鎭的中心，兩旁的屋子都那樣低，幾乎一伸手就可以摸得到屋頂，自然，牠是不敢和歐化的大飯店並爲一談的，但是，在牠的内實，却也包藏着萬家的，上至糖果食物，下至茶寮酒肆，可以說樣色俱全諸物齊備的。</p>
<p>－你看，這就是南京路的縮影喲！相信嗎？那個糖果店是老大房，那個香燭舖是虹廟房的壬申號，對嗎？她總會想岀了方法在引着人笑。</p>
<p>－在早晨，更好看，有各樣的菜，有魚也有肉，同小菜塲一樣。她的嘴總不肯停，指這樣說那樣的。</p>
<p>東西兩面進口的地方，都做就了木的橺欄，不用說，目的當然在護衛鎭上的安全，這多年以前的形式能在都會的外圍發現，或者可以說是一個奇蹟吧？</p>
<p>冬天的天是短的，一轉眼太陽又偏西了，在歸途的路上，受着晚風的吹襲，看着枯黃的田野，久住在都會的人，會感到别有一番况味的。</p>

<h3>電影達的簡史（三）</h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（三）艾迪生所懐想的有聲影片</p>
<p>但是大發明家艾迪生（ＴhomasA　Edisaon）的對於活動影片的研究，並不當作他的正項事業。他不過拿它當作一種兒戲之事，以爲祇須岀其餘緒，稍事推敲，一個可以連續攝影的開末拉，不難揮手而就也。他那個時候從事研究的，是電燈。他認爲電燈是造福人類的利器。他不知道他注意到活動影片的可能性的時候，他已經爲人羣造福了。</p>
<p>但是事情有比這個更奇怪的。艾迪生注意到活動影片的時候，一八八六年，他的原意是想製造一種（談話影片）（ＴalkingPictures）的。因爲在那個時候，他已經發明了留聲機，他想連帶在留聲機上，附着一個攝影機，將一個人的談話或唱歌的形狀，和談話唱歌的聲音同時表現岀來。他想那種東西，一定是很有趣的。他不知道，他所要發明的，在實際上就是現在的（有聲電影，）但是不知如何，他却將留聲機和電影當作兩個東西了，直到三十年之後，才把這兩件東西合併起來，而成了現代的有聲電影。</p>
<p>大槪年老的人，還能記行當時艾迪生，或迭克生（Ｗ·K·L·Dickson，他是艾迪生的副手，專管活動攝形機的一部份的。）所發明的一種（活動西洋景）（Ｋinetoscope）。他們可以吿訴你，他們將一個銅元放在那笨重的機器的洞裏，他們就可以從一個洞口，看見裏面有小人跳舞或打拳。這種小西洋景，大家都没有重視，却就是現在電影的雛形。它是眞實的活動電影，現代電影企業的先鋒。過了不久，那種西洋景的鏡箱，都擴大了，在了一間一間的房子，而看西洋景的人，亦不用一隻眼，凑在洞口去望裏張了。他們跑到房子裏面去坐着看了，而他們所看到的，亦不是那種小人了。他們所看到的，是和眞人　一樣大小的，在布墓上幢幢往來着。那時向這種（怪東西）投資的人很少，不過十幾個人，但是這些人，現在都成了腰纒千萬的富翁，影業的鉅頭了。</p>
<p>在活動影片初發明的時候，差不多祇要能活動，就是有趣的。攝製影片的人，還没有想到用影片來叙述什麽故事。到了一九零三年，才有一個博德（ＥdwinS·Porter），召集了一班戲院裏的次等角色，跑到紐吉賽，向路局借了一聯破火車，攝製了一張有故事的影片，呌做（火車被刦鉅案）（ＴheＧreatＴrainＲrobbery）。那是一齣獷野的喜劇，一共有七百四十尺長。你們要知道七百四十尺有多少長，或是多少短，你們祇要想，現代的影片，每捲總有一千尺長，而每張影片，大槪總有七八捲，亦不過在銀幕上，放映一個多鐘頭而已。</p>
<p>（火車被刦案）岀來之後，居然轟動了一時。活動影片成了娱樂的東西，和戲劇一樣，可以供人欣賞。在那張影片裏，當然有許多不合理的地方。時間合得不準確。那裏面亦没有大寫或近景。更無所謂面部的表情。總之强盜是壞人，英雄是好人但是都走着，跳着，跳着，奔着，幢幢往來不息。</p>
<p>在那個時候，亦無所謂攝影塲。所謂的影片，都是露天拍的。所有的背景，都是天然的。一個電影本事的代價，大約是從十元到十五元，要是一個攝製家肯岀到二十五塊錢，他可以得到一個傑構了。演員們，亦無所謂明星，因爲觀衆們對於演員們的名字和面貌，是記不清的，他們所得的酬勞，大約從二十五元一星期始，到五十元爲止。現在一般好萊塢明星們所拿的薪水，在那時是夢想不到的。你倘使知道了現在编劇者所得的薪水，你一定要可憐那從前的一班著作家。但是你倘使看看他們寫的東西，你又一定要以爲他們所得的過高了。本雅明韓浦頓（ＢenjamnHampton）在他所編的電影史裏，給了我們一個早先電影本事的樣本。以下就是··</p>
<p>（一貧苦而驕傲之女郎，因家道中落，復有老母，無法謀生，不得已岀而行乞。一男子見而憐之，且涎其美，擬與以金。女怒其儇薄，拒而不受，且歸圖自盡。該男子深悔孟浪，踵至其家道歉。適覩女自盡，遂救之，并遺金於女母而去。女醒，知其人悔恨之誠，漸生敬愛之心。結局則爲劇中諸人融融和樂於一家庭之中云云）。</p>
<p>這樣寥寥數語。就算電影本事，居然可以賣到十幾塊錢，不是酬資很豐了嗎？但是這種故事，却是我們的上輩所最喜歡聽的。他們看了那影片，竟爲之感泣歡欣。他們肯化錢去看那種東西，就使先進的企業家得了後盾，而電影事業亦就蒸蒸日上了。那時自命眼光遠大的資本家，都不肯爲那種快東西投資。他們說那種東西，是興滅無常的，不久就要消滅的。但是觀衆看見了。他們喜歡看。他們擁擠着去看。因此我們可以說，電影事業從開頭始，就是屬於觀衆們的。（未完）</p>

<h3>評（恩情俠義）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｍillion　Dollar　Bansom</p>
<p>大上海</p>
<p>從良心的來勸導恐嚇詐騙的匪徒們洗手自新，在美國電影中，已不是自（恩情俠義）第一次表現岀來，這一影片不過是道人所道而已。不過改編小說的劇作者，再在這一影片中表明這一主題，其盡　了爲現社會制度而說敎的任務，却不能不是表明他用心之苦。事實上。如此之流的藝術家，他們作了唯心的來遂行說敎的任務之外，乃是没有方法掩飾社會秩序，混亂不安的了。</p>
<p>但是劇作者撒謊的本領並不甚高明，譬如說作爲劇情主要關鍵的，富家少年要那大盜將自已綁票，並且酬謝大盜二萬元，這無論如何，不能敎人相信那是眞實的表現。這一點旣然如此脆弱，那末以後的劇情自然也跟着不通顺的了。</p>
<p>此外，無論那一方面都表現作品的庸俗，不管這裏有着圖案化的佈景，不管舞塲中的幾支歌曲很能動人，不管在鄕村中也有着若干程度的恬靜的　自然美，然而終於不能獲得整個的成功。</p>
<p>至於個人的演技更無可足述之處。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>（大路）觀後</h3>
<p>— 茅棣</p>
<p>（大路）的編導者所給予我們的，還是他貫的诗人作風，反帝的，超現實的。</p>
<p>築路的工人，會擔負起這麽重大的救民族，救國家的責任，而走江湖的女郎，飯店裏的姑娘，也會這樣機警，勇敢，誰也不敢相信這是現社會的事實，誠如作者自民所說··（在意識方面，恐有些理想吧！）</p>
<p>但，抓住築路工人作爲故事的主人，旣非陳舊的題材，而編導者又技巧地描寫成一個輕鬆美麗而偉大的畫面，明快簡潔的情調，使觀衆能覺得非常的興趣，而爲之感動，如路工被拷打時，金燄在地害内用剪刀割斷繩子時，這是多緊張！又如在小飯店裏爭着一杯茶吃，逼黎莉莉唱新鳳陽歌，這又是多麽愉快！</p>
<p>在演岀方面，每個人都有平均的戲來做，他把各個人的性情，在每個鏡頭，都能充分地儘量顯露岀來，而且創造了一個難得的跟鏡頭，那就是在尚冠武家設筵時各人的特寫。</p>
<p>明星有聲新片，張石川導演，（空谷蘭）中之胡蝶嚴工上，該片不日公映。</p>
<h3>（大路）我評</h3>
<p>— 征雁</p>
<p>看過了孫瑜編導的（大路）之後，我覺得這片子的内容，就劇的意識而論；在中國目前的影壇上，可以說是一部成功的作品。因爲劇情的偉大和悲壯，以及（大路歌）的雄偉，警惕，啓發了觀衆們一種民族意識的認識。作者這種洶湧熱情的流露，和他向上的精神，實在是難能可貴的！</p>
<p>但是在國產電影趨向於冩實主義的現在，（大路）似乎太偏重於理想，而缺乏現實的實在性。這就是說··（大路）中所有的人物，大都是作者的一種熱情的埋想所美化，而非現時代，現社會所有酌事實。</p>
<p>同時，劇中如胡老爺（帮辦）擺酒設筵，姬妾敬酒，以金錢買動金哥，繼將金哥等私刑毒打，幽禁於如從前王公大臣將私備監獄式的石室裏，以及丁香茉莉設法營救金哥等，這幾幕的演岀；顯然都是一種空洞的理想。</p>
<p>當然，導演手法的　敏，鏡頭的美麗，以及演員如黎莉莉等表情的進步，這都是使人满意的。</p>
<h3>藝華花絮</h3>
<p>應雲衛重進藝華後之導演工作將開始。劇名（時代英雄），係全部對白有聲片。</p>
<p>胡銳新作（生之哀歌）已全部竣事，黎明暉，王引，胡萍，王乃柬，秦桐等，均有極優美的成績。</p>

<h3>警吏乘龍（Ｗhite　Lies）（五）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>泰萊康登聽見瓊反怪他躱避她，就連忙辯白道·（没有，没有。至少我不是有意的）。瓊又笑道··（你救了我的命，怎麽又這樣對待我呢）？瓊說着，緊緊地搿住了他的一隻臂膊，叫他回頭望房子那面瞧。他見在房子前面草地上站着一個高大的人，四面張望着。瓊說道··（那就是亞塞爾，岀來尋找我的。我們趕快藏起來。那邊樹林子裏有一條小路，是通到石園裏去的。今晚月色很好，我們到那石園裏去玩玩。）泰萊於是攙着瓊，在高高低低的小路上走着，瓊倚在他的身上，時時嬌笑着。這時的泰萊康登，亦不再想起要回家的念頭了。</p>
<p>丹奥立佛侵呑公欵案的審判，快要結束了。許多陪審員在别室裏，經過了一番辯論之後，已經一個一個魚貫着回到法庭的陪審欄裏。大家都嚴肅而緊張地，靜待他們的發言。在記者席上坐着的，是快報的記者羅伯資，他一隻脚已經伸到桌子外面，半個屁股坐在凳子上，預備聽了判决，立時奔岀去打電話到報館裏。被吿坐在被吿廂裏，兩隻手捧着頭。他的兩眼通紅，視若無覩地向前瞪着。旁聽席裏坐着的，有泰萊康登，瓊密契爾，和約翰密契爾自已。他們這幾個人，在審判期内，是天天來旁聽及作證的。這時審判官的木鎯頭打下來了。書記官向犯人一揮手，奥立佛站了起來，靜聽宣判。陪審員的領袖咳了一聲嗽，拿着一張紙條子讀着道··（我們考慮的結果，被吿確犯被控的一切條欵。）奥立佛聽了，面色益加灰白。他嘴唇顫抖着，欲哭無淚的樣子。他突然站了起來，揮着拳，乾喊着道··（（你們害得我好苦！要是你們不拘捕我，到現在我的錢巴經可以償清了）。</p>
<p>法庭之内，頓時亂了起來。一個法警走到奥立佛的面前，叫他不要嚷。不想奥立佛一時狂性大發，他一拳將法警打倒了，從他的腰帶裏搶了一支槍，對着人叢裏。大家擁擠着想逃命，泰萊康登奮勇地跳過了欄杆，搶到奥立佛的面前。祇聽見砰然一響，康登倒了。奥立佛趁着大家忙亂的時候，立即逃岀了大門，將槍指住了大衆，不讓他們追趕。正在奥立佛要沈走的時候，一個衣服襤褸，形容枯槁的婦人，突然從人叢裏擠到前面，張着兩隻手，哀求着奥立佛不要放槍。瓊祇看了她一眼，但是她的面容，已深深印入她的腦筋裏，一霎時間，人叢已經將那婦人包攏過去，而瓊亦要緊從人叢裏望　後擠，去到泰萊康登身邊，趕緊设法將他抬到醫院裏去。</p>
<p>泰萊康登受傷以後的日子，是瓊密契爾最難過的日子了。她天天跑到醫院裏去看他。他的性命已經是危險萬份，不絶如縷了。瓊在家裏，亦時時等候着消息。電話鈴響了，她就嚇得心驚肉跳，不敢去接。後來病勢已經有了轉機，漸漸痊愈起來。瓊天天到醫院裏，去陪着他談話。他們二人間友愛的程度，似乎已經超過了朋友的程度了。但是有一件事使瓊感到不安的，就是康登受了奥立佛的鎗擊，反而對於兇手，表示同情起來。他說··（奥立佛不是壞人。當新聞登岀來的時候，他還竭力設法償還虧空的欵子哩。）瓊呢？他說··（登載新聞，是報紙的天職）。她臨走的時候，還故意氣他道··（我去和亞塞爾吃茶去了）。（未完）</p>

<h3>紐約車展前夕</h3>
<p>— 凌雲</p>
<p>除車身式樣外無多改車</p>
<p>一年一度的美國紐約汽車展覧會。又將在本月五日開幕了。所有全美國的各大車廠岀。都參加陳列。預料盛况一如往昔。關於一九三五式的汽車。機搆方面大致與一九三四式相仿。没有多大岀入。不過車身式樣方面。有很大的改進。據四日紐約消息。這次車展岀品的大槪情形如次。</p>
<p>福特車將有顯突的不同之處。一切福特牌子的新車。不久要在全美國各大城市陳列展覧。最近亨利福特宣稱。他預計在一九三五年間銷售一·○○○·○○○輛的福特車。可是有許多人見過新車的預吿的。都說這個估計還是很保守的。意思中間。銷數當不止此。並且預料新福特不但爲各種低價車的勁敵。就是一切高價車也要受到競爭的影響。福特公司預備拿四一五·○○○·○○○美金。作爲一年中生產計劃的費用。</p>
<p>又據非正式報吿。一九三五年式新福特Ｖ八引擎。將具一百匹的馬力。一九三四式的引擎制動測騐率祇有八十五匹。一九三三年Ｖ九爲八十匹馬力。新車引擎因爲馬力的增加。所以在加速和最高速率時。可以獲得相等的機力復元動作。新福特的另一進步。爲制動機的力量增加高。據稱一九三五式的新車。他的煞車制動部份增百分之五十。</p>
<p>新福特車的形體。比較了從前的式樣。要增長不少。雖然有些人到過他們廠裏。見過新車的說。福特的輪距並没有增長更變。而還有些人呢。却說新福特在實際上是已經增長的了。因爲伸展引擎在底架上的緣故。新福特車廂中伸足的地位增廣不少。駕坐都感舒適。車首散熱器較前略爲瘦削。尾部亦細小了些。不過在大體上。這新車和已往兩年所習見的。並無二致。</p>
<p>其他車廠對於前輪懸止的改革。大家都很淡薄。不過略有數家作爲一九三五年新車特點之一罷了。所以這情形是和一年以前大不相同。大家不願意改置前輪懸止原因。當然不止一端。可是有一椿是不得不注意的。就是無論那一輛汽車。如果要加以這樣子的改革。那末預計要多費上二十元美金。這樣一來成本增加。買主便要多岀價錢。對於銷路方面不無影響。因此有些廠家。不欲使他們的岀品增加售價。於是别岀心裁。想岀其他的方法來替代前輪懸止。據說成效很好。也能使車身衝突震撼减少很多。而這個法子呢。比起來就要簡省多了。據汽車界中人稱。雪佛蘭和克雷司勒在他們所造的兩種一九三五式新車中。將不再採用這種式樣的彈簧。而其他的製造低價汽車的車商。也要擯除這種機稱。不過是逐步的變換。所以方式略爲不同。</p>
<p>在機構方面有特殊改動的。要推司蒂倍克和赫特森兩種了。司蒂倍克新車將引用一種獨立式的前輪彈簧。以代盤繞式彈簧。這種彈簧在去年一月。克雷斯勒和通用車都已經引納的。新司蒂倍克車上没有一九三四式車中所謂（膝動作）的老式樞轴。替代上面所說的裝置。新車的前輪將直接裝在散熱器之下。而横接於底盤的。據稱比了盤繞式的彈簧。優良更多。</p>
<p>獨立前輪懸止的本意。是在增加駕乘的舒適。和减少震動及跳躍。一九三四式最初上市的幾種新車。那盤繞式的彈簧質料過於柔軟。所以轉灣的時候較爲滑溜。而車行過速的時候。便難於駕駛了。當然爲减免這種缺憾起見。祇有將那彈簧稍爲中硬。可是廢除老式樞轴所獲得的一部份利益。也就因之而消滅哩。有一家製造廠想在明年的新車上。不用自動齒輪變換。赫特森的新車中。將採用從引擎中所得的眞空力齒輪變換。這種力量和推動車窗屏上的括水及自動嚙合子一樣的。赫特森在廣吿中將採用（指尖管理）一詞以爲形容。因爲在駕駛舵輪近傍有一個槓桿。大小和自來墨水筆相仿祇要用指尖一撳。齒輪便跟之變動了。赫特森對於這個（指尖管理）在一九三五年四月一日之前。獲有專利特權。利和仍照自動齒輪變動的原理。校正引擎的轉動。他們採用自動齒輪變換已經有兩年了。</p>
<p>克雷斯勒（氣流）式的流綫化新車。他的式樣和一九三四式壁克不相上下。卡迪拉克的拉賽爾新車也和一九三四式者大同小異。哇爾特司麻别爾。和其他幾家公司的新車。將採用全金屬的車頂。這也是一九三五式中創見的。因爲以前的各種汽車。雖說是全鋼製造。可是車頂總是用編織物所造。以便减免震動的聲息。最近因爲製造上研究進步。已能用金屬製造車頂了。</p>
<h3>奥斯汀廠之今昔</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>三十年來飛突猛進</p>
<p>執英國汽車界牛耳</p>
<p>當一九零五年時。開設於倫敦長橋鎭之奥斯汀廠。不過一小工塲耳。估地面積二英畝半。僱用工友二百七十人。綜計第一年岀產汽車。僅共一百二十輛。但今則不然矣。此英國可靠汽車所產生之偉大製造廠。佔地總面積達二百二十英畝。其中積極應用者。約一百英畝。門前馬路長達一英里之遙。以視昔之侷促一隅。誠不可同日語矣。</p>
<p>奥斯汀廠。爲保持充份產量起見。所雇工友約一萬八千人。每年岀產汽車逾六萬輛。按以實際言之。現每月交付之各式奥斯汀汽車。卽較諸一九一四年以前九年内之總產量。亦且超岀多多。至以規模之恢宏。與設備之完善而言。奥斯汀廠。實不愧爲英國汽車製造廠中之翹楚。全部車輛。自原料以至最後漆飾完成。悉於長橋鎭之一機關内處理之。惟其然也。關於岀品方面之種種檢騐。乃均可嚴格執行。而管理上亦因而獲得充分合作　經濟便利焉。</p>
<p>所有鍜鑄塲等。係以原料改成奥斯汀之各組合部份。以便機製。至專爲製造奥斯汀汽車而應用之生產機器。綜計達六千部。若與二十年前相比較。則每種工具之平均價値。無不三倍於　昔。至其總價値。則截至目前。已逾四百萬鎊。過去兩年内。奥期汀廠擴充之面積。約達三十三萬方尺。所有耗費。殆逾十萬鎊。至最近再度擴充。計又增加面積十二萬七千方尺。所斥之資。計爲二萬八千鎊。蓋用以設置一規模偉大之新式車身裝架工塲者。按該廠於兩年内。耗費於新建築及機器工具者。總計達五十萬鎊之多。可謂鉅矣。惟如此鉅大耗費。實非虛糜。蓋該廠所預期之結果。均已如願以償。卽如現在每星期内所岀產之汽車。已逾二千輛。蓋卽其成功之明證也。按一九二二年時。該廠每星期成車一輛。須用工人五十五名。但在今日。則以九人工作一週。卽可製成一車矣。人工旣大節省。產量復吿激增。此奥期汀目今岀品之售價。所以較十二年前。反廉一省半也。卽如一九二二年式奥斯汀七馬力篷車。售價爲二百二十五鎊。今則此項車輛。其較前進步多多。固爲衆所公認。而其售價。則僅一○八鎊。以今視昔。其不同有如斯者。</p>
<p>吾人試往奥斯汀廠。一度巡視。則其管理縝密。設備齊全。與夫工作能力之高人一等。自可一望而知。並不禁發生觀止之嘆。而奥斯汀之所以精優卓絶。馳譽世界。吾人當亦恍然於其故矣。再據最近報吿。奥斯汀新車銷數。實較去年增加百分之七十二。故直接間接受僱於該廠之製造工人十一萬二千名。最近期内。工作大忙。蓋可想而知也。</p>
<h3>英京長橋地方奥司汀廠鳥瞰</h3>
<h3>德國蒸汽車試騐成功</h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>八汽缺式者已完成</p>
<p>蒸汽的用途，似乎在一天一天的减少。同時蒸汽鍋。蒸汽引擎等已慢慢的被現代工業家所摒棄。大家都猜想不久的將來。也許蒸汽發動機將絶跡於工業界。但是。事實與理想每有不符合的地方。爲了世界經濟的恐慌。同時汽油的產量遞减。價廉而簡便的蒸汽引擎及其他發動機。又在漸漸的被工業家所利用。寖寖有日上的趨勢。最近德國汽車工程家經了多次的試騐。已證明（蒸汽汽車）爲價廉而效率極高的汽車。眞是驚人的發現。足以開汽車史未有的新紀錄。</p>
<p>蒸汽汽車的主要原動力是連合（蒸汽鍋與（透平）而成。蒸汽鍋發生之蒸汽。導入（透平）。因蒸汽衝岀時的反動力作用。使（透平）的葉子推動。而作極快的旋轉。於是就可以鼓動前進齒輪。而使車身前行。此種制度。比較普通内燃機引擎的汽車要簡便得多。並且發動時没有劇烈的閙聲。此點是最有價値的。現在德人Ｈero利用Ｕ形的（透平）葉子。已經得到極好的效果。因爲蒸汽的衝岀反動力。可以增加不少。目前八汽缸式的蒸汽汽車。已完全製造成功。汽缸長爲十七英寸。直徑十五英寸。速率之範圍是每分鐘十至二千轉。完全係自動炭化機。效率很大。最近無聲飛機的搆造。也是這樣的。</p>
<p>利用蒸汽以行駛車輛。在耶蘇降生前二百年已有人發明過。現在的蒸汽汽車。不過是一種演進的成績。普通的内燃引擎和（透平）的不同的地方。就是前者發動時。作種種的振動和閙聲。後者</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>却非常流利。現在將内燃引擎汽車和蒸汽汽車的優劣比較如下。</p>
<p>發動　内燃引擎汽車　蒸汽汽車</p>
<p>原料　汽油或重油　煤與水（蒸汽）</p>
<p>原動力　引擎　蒸汽鍋與（透平）</p>
<p>制動　迅速　略遲</p>
<p>行駛　振動與閙聲甚烈　極少振動且無閙聲</p>
<p>速率　不能過高　能過高</p>
<p>内部組織　很複雜　非常簡單</p>
<p>每英里行駛價格　昻　賤</p>
<p>從以上的比較看來。雖然蒸汽汽車的制動較内燃引擎爲遲。但是優點很多。爲内燃引擎所望塵莫及。尤其是牠的便宜價格的行駛。極適合於規代經濟衰落的各國之需要。我們可以預料最近的將來。牠們蒸汽汽車。必將充斥汽車市塲啊。</p>
<h3>湘省木炭車現狀（續）</h3>
<p>— 與靑</p>
<p>夏鄭鵾與向德工程師之談話</p>
<p>（六）問木炭車在水平面坡度上。（卽百分之零）最高速度每小時若干英里。日前親自駕駛時。感覺此種車輛。似至某種程度後。不能將速度任意加高。惟一辦法。祇有借力於下坡時之動力。答。此與路面有關。在湘省碎石路面上。天晴時可達三十五英里。在上海謹記路開駛。曾達四十五英里。</p>
<p>（七）問日前歸途中。仍用五十四號車。載客約十人。行李不多。天雨甚大。該車爬上百分之五或百分之四坡度時。卽調用第二排擋。亦似不濟。有保救濟辦法。答。如僅欲增大汽車上坡能力。可照第五條所言。將後輪轴之齒輪比例增大。如欲增大汽車發動機之馬力。可有三法（一）增大汽缸内之壓縮壓力。（二）加大汽車缸直徑。（三）加裝過供器。</p>
<p>（八）問以第五十四號車而論。坡度與坡度長度在何種條件之下。尚可用第三排。在每小時五英里至十英里速度中駛過。答。此點尚無精確之試騐。可以報吿。就五十四號煤汽車而言。天晴時由下攝司開往長沙。除五里坡外。（距湘潭站九里坡度約百分之八）係用第二排外。其餘各坡度。僅用第三排止。毫未夾用汽油。</p>
<p>（九）問煤汽車與汽車在同等條件之下。約加重若干磅。其中木炭重量若干。答。此與煤炭發生爐之構造有關。如僅求其輕巧。則十六分之一英寸之鋼皮。作十六英寸直徑。十四英寸高之發生爐。亦可將車開行。其總重不過六十磅。惟僅能行十里。卽須添炭。且極易損壞。只能用作試騐而已。就玄字五十四號煤氣車而論。約加重三百磅。其中木炭重量約五十磅。</p>
<p>（十）問煤汽車能否過負。答。可稍過負。至於實在之數字。則尚未測騐。要之凡内燃發動機皆不能過負過多也。</p>
<p>（十一）問在同一環境。同一條件之下。煤汽車省費若干。請以實地試騐之結果。詳爲述之。答。今以實例爲證。玄字五十三號爲汽油車。五十四號爲煤汽車。二車之牌號·噸位·及年齡均同。行駛之路綫亦相同。就過去二個月（卽一二二月）二車行駛之成績統計比較之。煤汽車比汽車每行一千里。（每里工部尺一百八十丈）約可省費洋十七元七角。</p>
<p>（十二）問煤汽車改進中着眼於何種方面。答。暫時注意之點有三。（一）求發動機之馬力增大。（二）久行不需清潔。（三）清潔工作。更求簡易。</p>
<p>（十三）問長衡段路綫並不十分平坦。爲何煤汽車祇見於該段。而不應用於其他路綫。答湘省政府指定。暫以長衡段爲試行煤汽車路綫。故尚未及於他綫。</p>
<p>（十四）問湖南省爲煤氣車問題。曾耗試騐費若干·員工薪金若干·購置費若干·其他若干·答。余對煤氣車問題。僅負技術上之責任。關於經濟一節。未聞其詳。惟約計可費當不甚多。如可謂員工者。當前年試騐時。僅有助理二人。購置亦不甚多。僅氣體分析器一具。固體燃料分析器一具。測高温計一具而已。</p>
<p>（十五）問中國製造煤氣爐者共有若干家。及其地點。應用煤氣車者若干處。及共地域。答。我國目前製造煤氣爐者。僅有二家。中華煤氣車製造公司在上海。及中國煤氣機製造廠在漢口。上海浙江湖北湖南廣西陜西山西雲南安徽等處。均有煤氣車之足跡惟數目之多少而已。去年以上二公司合共銷售之煤氣發生爐。約一百套。</p>
<p>（十六）請敎對於煤氣車之意見。答。煤氣車實爲我國唯一之經濟的交通利器。以試騐所得之結果而論。每十磅木炭可抵汽油汽車一加侖汽油。或柴油汽車五磅柴油之銷耗。爲國防與國家經濟計。均有積極採用之必要。雖其搆造尚有未臻完善之處。然就吾輩技術家之立塲而言。正宜努力以謀改進。而不當如商人之購貨。不满意於此貨時。則棄之而不顧也。在技術方面而言。除搆造應用之材料。宜謀改進。如採用耐火鋼板作發生爐等事外。唯一重要之點。卽在增大發動機之馬力。查現在所謂之煤氣車。均係以用汽油爲燃料作根據。吾人雖能勉强改用煤氣。然實尚多不合之處。故鄙意若欲求煤氣車之改進。此後之研究工作。將不在發生爐而在發動機。凡用煤氣之發動機。其壓縮壓力。發火時間。汽缸直徑。氣門直徑。氣導管廻轉速度。及氣門開時間。在在皆與用汽油者有異。若能造一特種適用煤氣之發動機。裝於普通汽油汽車上。其效果必較就用原有之汽油發動機爲優。可無疑義。又海内學者。有提議將煤氣壓縮與筒者。隨帶車上應用。其法亦佳。惟其所用煤氣之成份。應與現在所用者不同。現在所用之煤氣。其中含淡氣百分之五十以上。此爲不可燃體。若一併壓縮。則不甚經濟。第此二項。其研究工程。均較浩大。湘省財力有限。目下不易進行。復聞海内有人反對煤氣車。採用木炭爲燃料。謂我國森林有限。將不堪斬伐。此點似可無容過慮。蓋需要可以刺激生產。如木炭之銷額增大。不僅不致破壞森林。反可促進農村之培植森林也。抑不用木炭爲燃料時。則自以用煤爲當。姑不論用煤時可發生之困難。較用木炭者爲更多。而不易解决。卽就供給之量而言。則煤與石油其藴藏雖富。然皆有限。要當有消耗盡凈之一日。若木炭則其生產之數。可與太陽同久也。</p>
<h3>建築汽車道路之新原料</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>北美道路建築工程師杜開爾氏。於紐約泰晤士報頭著文論道路之建築以供汽車之駕駛。謂過去十二年之中美國費去一五·○○○·○○○·○○○元美金之代價。築成汽車公路。縱橫全國。然以今日汽車應用之廣而言。已有之汽車道路僅須要者之十分之一。尚有十分之九尚待於興建。然今日美政府中所籌建汽車道路之欵爲四○○·○○○·○○○元。其不敷可知。欲設法補救則惟有改進道路之建築工程。採取經濟而又妥當之原料以應用也。</p>
<p>汽車道路之建造也。求其原料之鞏固。一適合於理想之汽車道路，求其路面之光滑。不染灰塵。能不受水侵堅固而又適合於經濟。凡此種種。皆須一一籌决。今日之建築汽車道路也。仍有應用昔日所用之原料者。歷史上自有馬車以來。對於道路之建築始有改進。蓋昔日無車輛往來。自無注意及道路之必要。馬車之發現也。路基之鞏固爲所需求。卽道路發達之記錄創始。然馬車之重量。速度皆不及汽車遠甚。故道路之建築必不如今日之堅固汽車之重量超岀馬車數倍。其速度亦遠過於馬車。昔日建築之道路不適用於今日也。其理明甚。然則昔日道路建築所用之原料。於今日道路建築亦不甚適用。故於今日言建築汽車道路。必待有新建築原料者也。</p>
<p>水泥道路固爲道路中之傑岀者也。畢咨堡大學之工程科研究道路工程。採取一特質之水泥。作爲道路建築之原料者。畢咨堡有數處殆皆爲水泥所建。然一般道路之建造。其中間必較之二旁爲厚。而水泥之道路。則二旁之厚度須較中間高。是其不均衡之處。且水泥過於堅實。亦非良善之道路。故現今對於水泥之道路。殆已不見有建造者。惟水泥頗適用於道路下層之路基。以其堅固異常之故。今日之良路。殆皆爲水泥作路基者。是爲道路中之最妥善者。以其鞏固之故。雖重量之車輛亦無所損壞也。</p>
<p>晚近對於路基一事。美國之道路建築界頗多新奇之發現。若用散沙作爲路基者頗能使道路平衡。而甚經濟然不能經過重之載重汽車。經此缺點。遂不能謂良善。有以細石爲路基者。雖甚經濟而不能平衡。亦非良善之策。乃有以炭質之原口以及應用棉布之類者。然皆不能盡善。故道路之路基除不泥之外。除非大塊之石塊始能有同一妥善之結果。然石塊之經濟更較之水泥奢華一倍。至各國之主要道路路基以木料爲原料者。則更較石塊奢侈雖有種種之長處。都以不甚適合於經濟而不廣應用也。</p>
<p>今日道路之最普通者。殆爲柏油路矣。然柏油路在冬日固爲良善之道路。殆至夏日則又不甚適合。此爲柏油路之短處。故歐美各國之道路建築家近日皆欲創造一水泥與沙及油之混合爲。能凝結成硬塊。爲道路之原料。現已有若干城市之中應用。計算每一英里共費去一○·○○○元。較之柏油路之費用减去一半。旣經濟而優良。恐爲近日道路中之最適宜者。惟水泥須用葡萄牙所產者。產量不多。尚不能普及。或能於將來有大量之產岀。廣事應用。</p>
<p>歐洲之道路建築。以德國爲最佳。其道路之面層有四英寸厚之高度。堅固殊甚。柏油亦已漸漸淘汰。而改用其他原料。水泥原料之應用甚廣。至於荷蘭有若干道路。皆建自橡皮。蓋荷蘭之岀產橡樹甚多也。橡皮道路之益點甚多。雖甚耗費。然不能損壞者也。南洋羣島亦有橡皮道路者。車輛馳行於上。可免去種種不良。然終以橡樹之岀產有限不足敷全世界道路之原料。現道路建築界皆設法廣植橡樹矣。</p>

<h3>Remnants of Liu Guitang Flee to Miaofeng Mountain Area</h3>

The bandit troops were unable to resist and fled to Jiusong Mountain yesterday morning. The residents and farmers of Donggezhuang and Jiusong Mountain were robbed clean. The Security Corps and the militia tracked and suppressed them. That night, the bandits fled to Daha Mountain and occupied it. The Second Security Brigade is still continuing to jointly pursue them with the security corps of the area. However, Liu's bandits are all cavalry bandits and flee quickly. According to reports, because we are chasing them very urgently, they are looting along the way, and most of them have crossed the Great Wall and fled to the territory of Xinglong, and a part seems to be fleeing towards Pinggu.

<p>(Nanjing) At the Executive Yuan meeting on the 8th, the proposal to establish a Ministry of Agriculture was discussed. The result was that its nature was quite similar to the former Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. Since the merger of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce into the Ministry of Industry, a Department of Agriculture has been specially established in the Ministry of Industry. If another Ministry of Agriculture is established, it seems inconsistent with the purpose of the previous merger, and the operating expenses cannot be transferred. Therefore, it was decided to draft a document stating the inability to establish a separate Ministry of Agriculture and submit it to the Central Political Council for review. No decision has been made on the proposed establishment of an Agricultural Policy Design Committee affiliated with the Rural Reconstruction Commission. (8th Dispatch)</p>

Shi Qingyang, chairman of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, telegraphed him to pay tribute on his behalf. It seems that the Panchen Lama's entry into Tibet will not be a problem. The princes of Inner Mongolia are sincerely supporting the Central Government. The Central Government has been allocating 30,000 yuan per month to the Mongolian affairs committee, and there should be no problems in Inner Mongolia. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The United States' Far East Policy</h3>
<p>Since Japan abandoned the Washington Naval Treaty, the tense situation in the Pacific has rarely eased. Japan convened the so-called Kwantung Army Conference in Dalian and Xingpu, and also loudly advocated the establishment of a new diplomatic policy toward Russia and the realization of a demilitarized zone. Furthermore, Japanese merchants, under the protection of their government, have been diligently engaged in economic surveys of China and the development of new markets in the South Seas Islands. This demonstrates the consistency of the foreign policy of the Japanese government and its people. This is why foreign newspapers are discussing a British-American alliance. In our observation, while Britain and Japan do have conflicting interests, the rift between the United States and Japan is even more difficult to bridge. How the United States will cope with the current crisis deserves the greatest attention from the world.</p>
<p>When Japan announced the termination of the Washington Naval Treaty, we heard that the United States' policy would focus on close cooperation between Britain and the United States under conditions that would not provoke Japanese resentment. However, we believe this is a tactic of the United States adapting to circumstances. To say that it has forgotten its old friendship with Britain and Japan and relies on this cooperation as the only positive policy to deal with Japan is too far from the true picture of the United States' Far East policy. In the future, the United States may not want to insist on the principle of the Open Door Policy in China as it has in the past. However, this can be seen as evidence that it is abandoning verbal protests in favor of practical preparations. After all, the United States is well-versed in diplomatic situations. Yesterday's overseas news reported that US President Roosevelt has indeed consulted Congress, requesting that the national defense budget for 1936 be set at a huge sum of 900 million US dollars, accounting for approximately 15% of the total expenditure. According to Roosevelt's explanation, this amount is only for strengthening naval and air force capabilities to the extent permitted by treaties. Whether there will be additional defense spending beyond this is still a secret that cannot be made public. As for actively developing Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and striving to strengthen national defense along the North Pacific coast, as well as the plan to complete 78 new warships by the end of 1936, these are facts officially acknowledged by the United States. The United States' sudden increase in naval spending to such an extent is clearly intended to resist Japan's Far East hegemony.</p>
<p>Moreover, the driving force behind the United States' Far East policy is not limited to military affairs. The focus of competition among the major powers in the Pacific is not currently on military preparations, but rather on economics. Therefore, developing overseas trade and opening up overseas markets to discharge surplus commodities and extract various raw materials are the goals of the United States' Far East policy, which is no different from that of Britain and Japan. In the Far East silver issue, the United States' control of Pacific power is already evident. Recently, in addition to sending commissioners to investigate the markets in the Philippines, the Washington government has also sponsored its commercial organizations to conduct market surveys in the Far East. All of these demonstrate the importance it attaches to economic interests in the Far East. The activities of the United States and Japan are diametrically opposed, making reconciliation impossible. This is another point that our countrymen should pay attention to.</p>

<h3>Panchen Lama's Brother Visits Shi Qingyang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Panchen Lama's brother, Cejue Lin, visited Minister Shi of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in the afternoon to report on the latest situation in Tibet. He attended Shi's banquet in the evening and plans to meet Panchen Lama in Mongolia after visiting Wang. (Eighth day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Cejue Lin, the younger brother of the Panchen Lama, visited Shi Qingyang at 3:00 PM on the 8th and left after an hour of conversation. Shi hosted a banquet for Cejue in the evening. Cejue is scheduled to visit President Wang in the next day or two before leaving Nanjing for Mongolia. According to Cejue, there are very few British people residing in Tibet, and even if there are any, they only come and go occasionally and are mostly engaged in surveys. There are also no British instructors commanding the troops of the Lhasa government. Si Lun Gaga is the nephew of the Dalai Lama, and his policies are no different from those of the Dalai Lama during his lifetime. The claim that he is pro-British is inaccurate.

<p>A New Page in Post-War European History: Franco-Italian Agreement Signed</p>
<p>Urges Germany to Return to the League of Nations and Discuss Disarmament</p>
<p>Cooperation to Maintain Peace</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval signed three important agreements and several additional protocols today. This is a major step forward in the post-World War I movement for universal peace. The three main agreements are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Franco-Italian Colonial Agreement;</p>
<p>(2) Danube River Agreement, also concerning guaranteeing Austrian independence;</p>
<p>(3) European Peace Consultation Agreement;</p>
<p>The important signing ceremony was held at the Palazzo Venezia at 7 PM this evening. Mussolini, representing the Italian government, and Laval, representing the French government, signed first. Italian representative to the League of Nations, Sir Aloisi, Italian Foreign Minister Suvich, and French Ambassador to Italy de Chambrun also signed as witnesses. In addition, several documents were signed, aiming to create an atmosphere of peace in Europe. These documents explicitly state that France and Italy jointly invite Germany to return to the League of Nations to cooperate in maintaining peace.</p>
<p>The Associated Press learned from responsible sources that Britain and Germany will soon announce their acceptance of the treaty guaranteeing Austria's integrity. Mussolini and Laval shook hands and congratulated each other after signing, showing their warm feelings. France and Italy also agreed to reopen disarmament negotiations based on the Italian memorandum of January 19, 1934, to resolve issues such as Germany's demand for military equality, Germany's return to the League of Nations, and the determination of Germany's disarmament limits. This agreement has now been sent to the Berlin authorities. Diplomatic circles here say that Germany supports this plan. (Seventh day Kuomin News)</p>
<p>(Rome) French Foreign Minister Laval departed from Rome for Paris this afternoon. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Suvich, Chairman of the League of Nations Saar Committee Aloisi, and other important Italian figures all personally saw him off. Crowds of onlookers lined the streets, cheering loudly. Soldiers were stationed along the route to provide strict protection. Traffic was cut off at the train station, and a military band played music outside the platform. The farewell scene between the French Foreign Minister and the Italian Prime Minister was extremely friendly, demonstrating the friendship between France and Italy. Neither France nor Italy commented on the disarmament provisions in the agreement, but it is said that the provisions mentioned Germany. According to sources in Paris, the provisions mention Germany's return to the League of Nations under certain cautionary conditions after rearming. (Eighth day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>France and Italy Congratulate Each Other on Success</h3>
<p>Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval signed an agreement last night on Austria's independence and Italy's acquisition of concessions in North Africa. This is the greatest success of general European peace efforts since the Great War. The signing took place at the Palazzo Venezia, with three main agreements signed: a diplomatic protocol, an agreement on colonial affairs, an agreement on the Danube region and guaranteeing Austria's independence, and an agreement on implementing consultation policies for the sake of European peace. In addition, there are several documents aimed at creating an atmosphere of peace among European countries. Judging from appearances, a political agreement may be completed with the assistance of the Bank of France to the Italian Bank.</p>
<p>After signing the agreement, Laval declared to the press that neither country had sacrificed important interests and that they had decided to discuss everything in detail so that the agreement could become a reality. Their policy is to participate on the basis of moral equality, with the sole purpose of contributing possible opportunities for the cause of peace organization to all governments. He firmly believes that their appeal will be answered. After Laval's speech, Mussolini said that they should not think that everything has been successful and must still cultivate the friendship between the two countries, which is formed by a common glorious civilization and the major trials of recent times. Mussolini then praised Laval, saying that the two had undergone the same political experiences, so they understood each other. Finally, he said that the year of reckless judgment has now begun with the joyful signing of the treaty.</p>
<p>Last night, the authorities issued a brief communique, which did not contain the contents of the agreement, nor did it mention the issue of limiting armaments. However, limiting armaments must be part of the treaty, and it is also reported that France intends to invite Germany to return to the League of Nations, which must be involved in one of the protocols. There was no hostility towards Germany in the text, nor was it mentioned that Germany's rearmament was illegal.</p>
<p>Abyssinia is the focus of the colonial agreement. Italy has obtained several concessions under this agreement. Some sources say that France has accepted Italy's application, allowing Italy to act freely in Abyssinian commercial and colonial affairs, but this has not been officially confirmed and does not seem to be included in the text.</p>
<p>The British and French governments have recently urged the Italian government to seek a peaceful resolution to the Ualual dispute with Abyssinia. Relations between Italy and Abyssinia seem to have improved somewhat in recent days.</p>
<p>The concessions obtained by Italy under the colonial agreement are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Italians in Tunis retain their Italian nationality for two generations; (2) Italy will obtain a strip of land north of the Tibesti Massif, 800 miles long and 100 miles wide;</p>
<p>(3) Italy will obtain the land of Belmaté Blanc in French Somaliland, excluding the port of Djibouti. Italy may purchase between 2,000 and 3,000 shares of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway.</p>
<p>France is very pleased with the success of the Rome Agreement. Paris now feels that Germany will not stay out of it, and the progress that France and Italy have made towards a disarmament agreement is better than initially expected. France has clearly accommodated Italy's position, which will make Laval's upcoming trip to London even more important.</p>
<p>German political circles have not yet commented on the Franco-Italian agreement. According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, the German government is concentrating on matters related to the Saar plebiscite, so it seems unlikely that it will express an opinion before next week. (Eighth day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Communique After Signing</h3>
<p>(Rome) After the official signing of the Franco-Italian agreement, the following communique was issued to the press at 8:30 PM: (As a result of the Franco-Italian talks held by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval, several agreements have been signed concerning the interests of the two countries in Africa and declaring the consensus of the two governments on European issues. Mussolini and Laval jointly stated that it is necessary to obtain a multi-faceted understanding on the issue of Central Europe. The two governments fully agree and believe that the proposals already adopted on the issue of Central Europe should be submitted to the relevant countries for review as soon as possible. On the one hand, while waiting for the signing of such a multi-faceted agreement, on the other hand, France and Italy will jointly review various measures to deal with the current situation in the spirit of this understanding.) (Seventh day Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Diplomatic Circles Surprised</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The sudden turn of events in the Rome talks and the establishment of a broad agreement between France and Italy have surprised diplomatic circles here. Although the diplomatic authorities here refused to take any position before the official announcement of the Franco-Italian agreement, they could not help but reveal their suspicion of the agreement. The reason for their deep suspicion is the fear that Germany's diplomatic policy after the Saar plebiscite will be greatly hindered by the rapprochement between France and Italy, and that the rapprochement between France and Italy will inevitably greatly undermine the movement to revise the peace treaty. The German General Review commented on the non-interference in Austria's internal affairs, saying that the German people will never forget the important event of other countries interfering in internal affairs, namely the drafting of the Treaty of Versailles, which prohibited the merger of Austria and Germany. The Berlin Daily said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly expressed his support for revising the peace treaty to his people. Mussolini's ability to win people's hearts is mostly due to this spirit and influence. However, the so-called agreement to ensure the security of Central Europe runs counter to the spirit of treaty revision.</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although only one of the four recently concluded Italo-French agreements has been made public, its content has been largely speculated and known by the outside world, and various governments can express their official attitudes. According to the German Foreign Policy Review, as far as Europe is concerned, this agreement must be divided into two, namely the Franco-Italian Consultative Agreement and the Central European Non-Interference Agreement. Among them, only the Franco-Italian Consultative Agreement is an accomplished fact, because Mr. Mussolini has changed the responsibility for maintaining the independence of Austria from Italy alone to be shared by France. As for the Central European Agreement, not only France and Italy are promoting its realization, but all Central European countries are involved, especially the major powers, because this is not only a problem of Austria, but a problem of the entire Danube region. This involves the relationship between Hungary and the Little Entente countries and the relationship between Yugoslavia and Italy. Although the progress of Franco-Italian relations is a major key to the European situation, which cannot be ignored, there are still many problems to be solved urgently, especially economic problems.

<h3>Hungary's Unease</h3>
<p>Budapest: Hungary has been uneasy about the talks on Austrian independence held in Rome. According to government sources, Hungarian public opinion does not approve of the government's involvement in guaranteeing Austria's current borders, because the Burgenland region of Austria was originally Hungarian territory, but was later ceded to Austria after the Treaty of Trianon was concluded. If Hungary now participates in guaranteeing Austria's current territory, it would be tantamount to unconditionally abandoning that land. Hungary is dissatisfied with the current borders of Czechoslovakia and Romania, but can submit a reservation to Yugoslavia and temporarily agree to it. (Seventh day Kuomin News)</p>
<h3>United States Expresses Deep Interest</h3>
<p>(Washington) The conclusion of the Rome Agreement between France and Italy, especially the conclusion of the protocol on the issue of German armaments, has deeply impressed the State Department. Both the White House and the State Department believe that the time for the revival of the disarmament conference is not far off. US Minister to Switzerland Wilson is scheduled to return to Europe on January 10 with President Roosevelt's instructions. General opinion here believes that the site of the disarmament conference has been cleared, making it easy for Germany to rejoin the disarmament conference. In the next disarmament talks, the United States may be very active. President Roosevelt's 1933 proposal to strictly define the aggressor nation and his proposal last year to revise the principle of freedom of the seas will probably be re-presented. If there is an opportunity to conclude an agreement on limiting armaments, there must be detailed discussions in the first meeting in Geneva this year. (Seventh day Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Saar Bans Assemblies</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken: The Saar Plebiscite Commission, after consulting with the Governing Commission, issued an order today prohibiting people from holding assemblies from the 10th of this month until the day the vote is announced. All public and private organizations in the region must comply with this ban, except for theaters and cinemas. (Seventh day Kuomin News)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Several newspapers here are very resentful of the Saar Plebiscite Commission's cancellation of the votes cast yesterday. The reason for the invalidation is that the voters performed the Hitler salute when voting and did not use black pencils to write, violating the voting regulations. The voters yesterday were civil servants, because they will be constrained by their duties during the general vote on the 13th and will not be able to vote. (Eighth day Kuomin News)</p>

It is reported that the two trains were traveling on the same track. The leading train suffered minor mechanical damage, reducing its speed. The driver of the following train failed to heed the stop signal and continued as usual, causing it to collide with the rear of the leading train.

<h3>Retrial of Lindbergh Kidnapping Case: Nanny's Testimony</h3>
<p>Admits to Informing Boyfriend of Household Activities</p>
<p>Hauptmann's Face Turns Ashen in Court</p>
<p>Flemington: The retrial of the Lindbergh kidnapping case continued today. Defendant Hauptmann turned gray when Betty Gow arrived to testify about the circumstances of the Lindbergh baby's disappearance. The prosecutor presented the witness with a baby garment found near Lindbergh's body. Gow choked and said, "I think I made this." She continued, "On the night of March 1, 1932, at 10 p.m., I entered the nursery. Fearing to wake the child, I did not turn on the light, but felt the crib in the dark. It was empty. Knowing something was wrong, I rushed out to tell Colonel Lindbergh. He ran upstairs and called to his wife, 'Anne, they have stolen our child!' Lindbergh then grabbed a gun and rushed outside, while the women of the house sat silently inside, waiting," she said. At this point, the defendant's lawyer cross-examined Gow about her boyfriend. Gow admitted that she was friends with a young man, one of whom was named Red Johnson, who is now in Norway, and stated that New Jersey provided her expenses, asking her to come to the United States from Norway to testify at Hauptmann's trial and give her 650 dollars, and Gow confessed that she had told Red Johnson about the Lindbergh family's actions. The defendant's lawyer asked if she had heard the dog bark that night. Gow replied that she had not, and that the actions of the cook's wife, Wetley, did not raise the dog's suspicions. The defendant's lawyer continued to cross-examine, hoping to prove that although the kidnapping was not carried out by the Lindbergh family, the plan may have been drawn up in the Lindbergh household. At the end of the cross-examination, Gow broke down and cried, but quickly composed herself, wiped away her tears, and powdered her face. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Flemington: When questioned by reporters today about the ladder outside the Lindbergh baby's bedroom window, Hauptmann, accused of kidnapping and murdering the Lindbergh baby, replied that if he had placed the ladder, he would be a very bad carpenter. Prosecutor Hawke claimed that the authorities would prove that the footprints under the bedroom window were made by Hauptmann because two soldiers wearing size nine shoes had placed their feet in these footprints and found them to be quite suitable. It is known that Hauptmann also wears size nine shoes. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Political Parties Criticize New Budget Proposal</h3>
<p>Revenue Insufficient to Cover Expenditures Hinders Recovery</p>
<p>Large Increase in National Debt Causes Concern</p>
<p>(Washington) Both the Democratic and Republican parties have expressed concern over the large increase in the national debt in their criticisms of the budget proposal submitted to Congress by President Roosevelt today. Expenditures for the fiscal year beginning July 1 will total $8,520,000,000, while revenue is estimated at only $3,992,000,000. Congressman Taber, a Republican member of the Appropriations Committee, stated today that if this continues, we will only prevent recovery. Senator McNary, the Republican leader, stated that it was regrettable that the authorities had failed to balance the budget, but that relief for the unemployed was necessary. Democratic Senator Smith stated that recovery will not be achieved until we find a way to restore foreign trade. Other critics have expressed the intention of Congress to put a check on the huge expenditures proposed by President Roosevelt. Some also said that the financial community will become even more confused and that the burden on taxpayers will become increasingly heavy in the future. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) A clause in the National Industrial Recovery Act states that the President may prohibit the transportation of petroleum produced in excess of the maximum limit permitted by the government, with violators subject to fines or imprisonment. The Federal Supreme Court has recently declared this clause invalid. In addition, there are other issues under consideration by the court. It seems certain that the court will uphold the cancellation of the clause in debt contracts requiring payment in cash. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Sharp Fall in Silver Prices in Bombay</h3>
<p>Bombay: News of President Roosevelt's budget message to Congress from Washington has had a major impact on the Bombay silver market. Today, the spot price opened at Rs. 64.07, twelve annas lower than the closing price on Sunday. Later, it was still ten annas, and the price fell to Rs. 63.13. However, sentiment turned strong in the afternoon, and the price rebounded to Rs. 64.04, seven annas higher than the morning closing price. It then rose another anna at 5:30 p.m. Today's sharp fall in silver prices was caused by short-sellers interpreting the Washington news as a harbinger of a major reduction in the silver coinage tax in 1936. Speculators who had bought too much panicked and closed their positions, believing it to be a sign that the U.S. silver purchase program in 1935 would become calmer. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>President of South Manchuria Railway to Remain Temporarily</p>
<p>Pu Yi Scheduled to Visit Tokyo in April</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Changgang Longyilang, the newly appointed Director-General of the Guandong Bureau, departed from Tokyo Station at 9:00 a.m. today for Manchuria via Korea. Changgang made the following remarks on the train: "The policy towards Manchuria will be carried out according to established guidelines. I intend to serve under the command of the new South Manchuria ambassador with all sincerity. My task is to handle the administration of the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway's affiliated lands. I have no intention of changing personnel. I will proceed after taking office, based on the principle of placing people according to their talents. The rumor of replacing the President and Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway is completely false. There are no problems with the current South Manchuria Railway, so this kind of rumor is a bit premature. As for the Japan-Manchuria Economic Conference, I intend to study it after gathering opinions from various foreign regions." (Dentsu, 8th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Explains Controlled Investment in Manchuria</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi explained at the cabinet meeting on the 8th the situation of Japan's exports and imports to Manchuria within Showa 9 (1934), the status of investments in Manchuria, and other related matters, drawing the attention of the cabinet members. The Finance Minister's proposal showed a desire to control future investments in Manchuria. The details of his explanation are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>"In Showa 9, Japan's foreign trade achieved its best results, with increases in both imports and exports, and a considerable trend towards balancing overseas receipts and payments with freight and other non-trade receipts. This is commendable for Japanese trade. What I want to draw to the attention of the cabinet members now is that the total amount of investment in Manchuria in Showa 9 has reached a huge sum of 140 million yuan. However, this amount of investment will absolutely not cause unease in the financial community, because the investment in (Manchukuo) will be recovered in the future. However, in future investments, it seems that control is necessary. Originally, Manchuria is also a foreign country, and it should not be treated the same as investing in the mainland, and it is directly related to the exchange rate. Especially since the recent Sino-Soviet Railway negotiations are about to be concluded, we must also pay attention to increasing capital. There are also fears that Japanese capital invested in (Manchukuo) will escape elsewhere in the future. Therefore, when investing in Manchuria in the future, please fully consult with the Ministry of Finance and carefully discuss it before making a decision." (Domei, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of State and Treasury Secretary Discuss Silver Issue</h3>
<p>U.S.-China Negotiations Underway; Easing Silver Purchases a Natural Result</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press has learned from reliable sources that Secretary of State Hull and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau held a lengthy meeting today to discuss the U.S. silver policy and its impact on China. Recently, a telegram from Shanghai stated that Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Dr. Shi Zhaoji, had reported to his home government that the U.S. government had agreed to change its silver purchase plan to help China. Today's meeting took place after this news was received. Hull and Morgenthau remained silent about the content of the meeting. When reporters asked Treasury Secretary Morgenthau if the U.S. would allow China to avoid a sharp increase in silver prices, he answered cautiously, saying, "This is a rumor from Shanghai. I am just doing what I have always done." Secretary of State Hull later told the Associated Press that there were no new developments in the U.S.-China silver problem negotiations, but that the two countries had recently exchanged views on the matter. However, according to powerful sources, the U.S. easing its silver purchase plan is a natural result of U.S.-China negotiations. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Hull Remains Silent on Revising Silver Purchase Program) (Washington) Secretary of State Hull told a Reuters reporter today that he knew nothing about the alleged U.S. government plan to revise its silver program to assist China. According to news from Shanghai, negotiations to amend the U.S. silver policy are currently underway. Therefore, a Reuters reporter visited Hull to inquire about this matter. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(No Guarantee Made to Prevent Silver Prices from Rising) (Washington) According to the Shanghai American newspaper, Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Shi Zhaoji, has obtained assurances from the State Department that the U.S. government will try to prevent silver prices from rising again. This news has caused great surprise here. A person with special qualifications stated to Havas that the U.S. government has not made any such guarantee. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Reduced Coinage Tax Revenue; Purpose Not Difficult to Guess) (Washington) The silver coinage tax for the 1936 budget is only 25 million yuan, a decrease of about 75 million yuan from the estimated amount for this fiscal year. Treasury officials declined to say whether this meant that the silver purchase program would be greatly reduced, nor would they comment on whether the estimated reduction in coinage tax revenue was related to the news from Shanghai that U.S.-China negotiations are underway, asking the U.S. to pay special attention to the Chinese situation when carrying out the silver purchase program.

<h3>France's Attitude Towards Naval Conference: Proposes Inviting Russia and Germany to Participate</h3>
<p>Formal Note to Washington</p>
<p>Japan Expresses Dissent</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Foreign Ministry today sent a note to Washington, with copies sent to the British and Japanese governments, stating that when negotiating a new naval treaty to replace the Washington Treaty recently abolished by Japan, naval powers such as Germany, Russia, and Spain should be invited to participate. The purpose of this French move is to determine the control of smaller navies and to eliminate the fear of any major power being left out. The full text of this note will be released when Foreign Minister Laval arrives in London. The naval issue is an important part of the Anglo-French agenda. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>French Ambassador Visits Hirota (Tokyo) The French Ambassador to Japan, Billyard, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday, expressing the French government's views on the issue of arms reduction as follows: The French government regards the Washington Treaty as a provisional treaty before 1936, with various treaties signed with reservations. However, the inferior naval power stipulated by the treaty is not satisfied, so it agrees in principle with Japan's abolition of the treaty. The international situation is different from the past. Future meetings should invite countries other than the signatory countries of the Washington Treaty, especially Germany. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that arms reduction treaties should first be concluded with major naval powers such as Britain and the United States, and then gradually extended to other countries. Even the three countries of Britain, Japan, and the United States cannot agree on their opinions in this preliminary arms reduction negotiation. Japan finds it difficult to agree to the participation of a majority of countries. (Domei, 8th)</p>
<p>Britain Remains Temporarily Silent (London) British officials have received a copy of the French government's note on the naval issue, stating that if this note is to be answered, it should be answered by the U.S. government. In addition, the British side believes that it is useless to re-mention the naval issue at the present time. Therefore, Britain will not give any answer to Japan in the next few weeks. However, Yamamoto, the Chief Naval Expert of the Japanese Navy, is still in London. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<h3>Enemy Air Force Difficult to Invade</h3>
<p>Vincent Opposes Merger of Naval and Air Forces</p>
<p>Maintains Navy as First Line of Defense</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the opinion of Representative Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, in the event of war, the enemy would invade the United States by sea, but he does not believe that a strong country outside the American continent has already matured the timing to invade the United States by air. Vincent recently reported to the Federal Air Force Committee that, according to the geographical location of the United States, the enemy has no way to invade the United States except by sea. Even if they want to pass through Canada and Mexico, they must go through the sea before they can land in Canada and Mexico. Therefore, the navy will continue to be the first line of defense for the United States. Even with the recent advances in aircraft, transoceanic air raids are still an unresolved issue. Vincent supports avoiding weakening the naval air force and absolutely opposes the merger of the air force. Vincent advocates that the navy bear the full responsibility for protecting the coastline of the United States and the security of U.S. overseas territories but recognizes the need for communication between aircraft, airships, and warships.

<h3>Famine in Hokkaido, Japan</h3>
<p>Most Young Men Die in Battle in Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>Soybean Cakes for Food, Selling Daughters into Prostitution</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a person from Hokkaido, since the poor harvest last autumn, the entire area has fallen into a state of famine. In addition, the climate is extremely cold, and there are already feet of snow. In the past three years, affected by the period of economic recession, most of the young men, who were accustomed to the cold, were conscripted and dispatched to northern Manchuria, and many died in battle. Debts have accumulated. Now, with the double poor harvest, there is nothing to eat. Soybean cakes are imported from the northeast and have always been used as horse feed and fertilizer. Now they have become food for farmers. Some even eat tree bark, leaves, and grass roots to resist starvation. As many as 25,000 young women have been sold by their parents into prostitution. Officials are trying to cover up this fact. (China United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Cuba Announces Termination of Commercial Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Watanabe, the Cuban Chargé d'Affaires on the 7th, the Cuban Secretary of State announced on the 5th that the provisional commercial treaty between Cuba and Japan would be terminated. As a result, this treaty will lose effect on April 5, three months after the notice of termination. Thus, Cuba and Japan have become countries without a treaty. At a time when the U.S. government is adjusting commercial relations with countries in Central and South America based on the principle of reciprocity advocated by Secretary of State Hull, the moves by Cuba and other Central and South American countries to terminate commercial relations with Japan are noteworthy.

The final price was four dollars, ninety cents six eight seven five, one eight seven five higher than the opening price.</p>
<p>▲British-French The French franc was more active. The opening exchange rate between British and French currencies was seventy-four francs ○ three, six pounds lower. Then it rose six pounds around eleven o'clock. Afterwards, the franc price gradually weakened, and it was seventy-four francs two one at two o'clock in the afternoon, eighteen pounds higher than the opening price.</p>
<p>(Cotton and Wheat) ▲Liverpool Cotton Market Steady and firm this morning.</p>
<p>At one o'clock in the afternoon, the May futures price was six point eight seven, up four pounds.</p>
<p>▲Liverpool Wheat Market Steady today. At one o'clock in the afternoon, the May futures selling price was five shillings two pence six two five, three seven five higher than yesterday's price.</p>
<p>▲New York Cotton The cotton market was weak, with prices falling two to four pounds.</p>
<p>▲Bombay Cotton Market Trading was very light today. Long positions were slightly closed, and sales from European exporters were absorbed by short covering. The closing price of Broach cotton was two hundred and thirty-nine shillings seventy-five, up one rupee two five.</p>
<p>▲Winnipeg Wheat Wheat prices were slightly lower, but Winnipeg wheat prices did not change much.</p>
<p>(Rubber) ▲London The rubber market was stable today. The midday price for April and June futures was six pence eight seven five, unchanged.</p>
<p>(Securities) ▲New York The President's budget document is viewed on Wall Street as constructive, but operators have not yet fully studied it, so it is expected that the securities market will still be slightly stable at the opening this morning, with prices rising slightly. However, the news that the Supreme Court rejected the Rehabilitation Administration's control of oil production has caused oil stocks to fall slightly at the opening, and it seems inevitable that they will continue to weaken. Industrial news is still good, and steel production yesterday increased by more than four percent, which has a good impact on steel stocks. There was selective buying in the securities market before noon. The prices of one or two public utility stocks also rose slightly. There were no major changes in railway stocks. On the whole, prices rose and fell, with gains and losses offsetting each other. However, commentators believe that a good rising trend is promising. The New York securities market prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>The Rehe bandits, feeling oppressed by the Japanese and puppet troops increasing their forces, more than 300 people sneaked into the interior through Yanqing Yongning outside the pass along the Shayuli mountain ravine, intending to enter the war zone. When they sneaked into the Bohai Institute area 40 miles northwest of Huairou, the authorities, upon receiving the report, urgently transferred the 2nd Security Brigade stationed in Miyun to prevent and block them. Xu Shiying, the brigade commander of the brigade, led the 5th Company under Mu Zisan and the 6th Company under Liu Zhenhai to head to Toudaohe, 30 miles northwest of Huairou, to block them. Seeing the government troops迎剿, the bandits lingered in Shayuli Bohai Institute and did not dare to advance. They still fled back along the original route, passing through Zhuizikou and Heishuiyu, passing through Huailai Yanqing, exiting Henglingkou and fleeing back outside the pass. The Yanqing observation army is currently dispatching troops to block them. The 2nd Security Brigade, which was dispatched to Toudaohe, has been withdrawn to its original defense yesterday because the bandits fled far away. As for the remnants of Liu Guitang's troops, they have also been severely suppressed by various armies. Some fled to the Chahar border, and some fled into the war zone, but the number is very small, and it is not difficult to eliminate them. (5th)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Relief Association Raising Funds for Emergency Relief in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Anhui Investigation and Relief Office Telegraphs Request for Large Sum to Aid</p>
<p>First Batch Distributed to Twenty Counties Including Huaining</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Master Hongsan and others, directors of the Anhui Province Investigation and Relief Office of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Famine Relief in Various Provinces, after arriving in Anhui, immediately organized the Investigation and Relief Office, which was attached to the Provincial Disaster Area Fundraising and Relief Association. Previously, considering that the disaster area in Anhui Province was too large to be fully covered, they specially telegraphed the association to allocate a large sum to aid. Yesterday, they received a reply stating that the current relief funds are only 80,000 yuan, and eight or ten counties in the drought area that have recently been affected by bandits should be selected for the first batch of relief. The remaining funds will be handled after the recent supplementary allocation of relief funds. In addition, 640 new cotton-padded clothes and 160 old cotton-padded clothes will be allocated to Anhui Province. It is also reported that the office, according to the results of various investigations, has stipulated that the disaster-stricken counties in Anhui Province are divided into the most severely and next most severely affected levels, and personnel will be sent to the field in batches to investigate and provide relief. The first batch of severely affected counties that will be given priority for emergency relief are Huaining, Tongcheng, Qianshan, Taihu, Zhide, Dongliu, Qingyang, Shitai, Jingxian, Jingde, Taiping, Ningguo, Xuxi, Xiuning, Shexian, Qimen, Huoshan, Huoqiu, Lihuang, and other twenty counties, divided into ten groups. Personnel for investigation and relief will be selected soon and dispatched in different directions. The office has now convened a full meeting of the standing committee members to hold a relief work meeting, which resolved three important cases as follows: (1) When the relief funds arrive in the province, they will be stored in the Bank of China, and the withdrawal procedures will be the responsibility of one person each from the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Fundraising and Relief Association, and the Investigation and Relief Office to sign; (2) When the investigation and relief personnel arrive in each county, they will send letters to the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government, respectively, to order the party and government organs and the stationed troops to assist and protect them at any time, and also send letters to the Provincial Government to issue passports; (3) The disaster-stricken counties that have not been allocated in the first batch will be investigated and relieved when the second batch of relief funds arrives.

<h3>Traitor's End: Zhao Xinbo Executed by Shooting</h3>
<p>Invited to a Banquet by Hishikari, He Was Executed on the Spot</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Before Zhao Xinbo, a well-known traitor, returned from Japan after investigating constitutional government, the puppet government dismissed him from all his puppet positions last month. When Hishikari inspected the Lianpu area, Zhao happened to return. Hishikari invited Zhao to a banquet as a pretext. After Zhao arrived, he was immediately shot. Zhao's wealth from betraying the country, amounting to hundreds of thousands of gold, was also confiscated. The reasons for his death are: (1) Zhao is a talented but treacherous person. Since he can sell his motherland, what country can he not sell if given the opportunity? (2) Since the Incident, Zhao has relied on the Honjo military department as his backing, and has been very disdainful of Japanese personnel in the puppet organization. Therefore, many Japanese personnel resent him. (3) Zhao mistakenly believed that the puppet organization was a genuine country, and therefore rebuked the (Manchu) people in the puppet organs to their faces when they tried to curry favor with the Japanese. Therefore, the puppet Manchu people also resented him. (4) The puppet Supervisory Yuan wanted to investigate the Legislative Yuan under Zhao's control, but Zhao refused, which aroused dissatisfaction among the puppet organizations. As for the cause of death announced by the Japanese, they falsely accused Zhao of communicating with the interior. Currently, people in the puppet organization who relied on Zhao for support are all crestfallen and look extremely pitiful. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Hebei Province Strictly Prevents Liu Bandit's Return</h3>
<p>Twelve Counties Along the Border Ravaged by Bandits</p>
<p>Police Teams Block and Suppress in Different Directions</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The remnants of Liu Guitang's troops, last month, raised the false banner of the "First Regiment Under Heaven" and roamed the borders of Hebei, once disturbing the suburbs of Pingjin. After being repelled by the Tongxian militia and stationed troops, Yu Xuezhong feared that the bandit troops would sneak into the war zone and join forces with the local bandits in Yutian County and the old troops of Shi Yousan, making it difficult to suppress them and further spreading the poisoned area. Therefore, he dispatched Zhang Yantian's troops from the newly formed Special Police Team of the War Zone stationed in Cangzhou, and transferred two companies of elite troops to pursue them. At the same time, the Baoding Xingying also dispatched two companies of the 17th Cavalry Division to advance north along the Pinghan Road to block them. The bandit troops could not stay, and because the militia of Wanping, Daxing, Tongxian, Baxian, and Pinggu five cavalry surrounded them on different routes, they changed their plan to disturb the war zone and returned to harass Huairou and Miyun. After being intercepted by the militias of these counties, they took advantage of the situation to break through and return to eastern Chahar. According to the reports received by the Hebei Provincial Government in recent days, the bandit troops seem to have entered the area between Huailai and Yanqing. Although Chahar Province has received a telegram from the Hebei Provincial Government, the blockade was not timely, and the bandits have already entered the territory. The provincial army has been dispatched to search, but no traces of the bandits have been found. The bandit troops have been roaming on the border of Hebei for more than a month, and the affected counties include Lingshou, Pingshan, Quyang, Laishui, Tangxian, Manxian, Yixian, Wanxian, Changping, Shunyi, Wanping, and Huairou, among others. Among them, Lingshou, Quyang, Tangxian, and Manxian were entered and exited by the bandit troops several times, and the number of villages looted and burned was over a hundred, which was more serious than other counties. Now, the provincial authorities are deeply afraid that the bandit troops will come again to harass. On the one hand, they are telegraphing Chahar Province for assistance in suppression, and on the other hand, they are ordering the teams of Changping, Huairou, and Miyun counties along the border to strengthen their defenses. The special police team under Zhang Yantian, which was dispatched to pursue, because the bandit troops looted horses along the way for riding, and traveled day and night, avoiding direct conflict, resulting in a large disparity between the special police's infantry and cavalry, and they were never able to catch up. The provincial order then ordered them to temporarily station in Fangshan to assist the Huaimi team in preventing and blocking.</p>
<p>This time, the remnants of Liu Guitang's troops were originally rebelled troops of the Chahar Army Xia Ziming. Last autumn, when Brigade Commander Xia Ziming went to Lushan for training, Liu Guitang, who was active in Tianjin, secretly sent his groom to Xia's brigade to incite rebellion. When the matter was leaked, the Chahar authorities were able to prevent it, so only two companies of cavalry mutinied, led by the bandit leader Dai battalion commander, and fled to the border of Hebei. Along the way, they recruited farmers and expanded the bandit forces as much as possible. When they harassed Pingdongbei, there were already more than 400 people. In addition to Dai battalion commander, there was also a groom of Liu Guitang and a 19-year-old teenager. The three bandit leaders were all exceptionally fierce, proficient in riding and shooting, and could open box cannons with both hands. Even in winter, they did not wear boots or shoes, but wrapped several pairs of cloth socks around their feet. Each person had several horses, so the police and groups who were harassed and on foot were often overwhelmed when they encountered them. Liu Guitang intended to have the troops mix into the war zone and establish contact with a puppet force of Shi Yousan's troops in Yutian to take a coordinated approach and prepare for recent attempts. Now that the plan has failed, the bandit troops have re-entered Chahar, still wanting to collude with the rebellion of Xia's troops stationed in Yanqing, or return to Hebei, or go far away to northern Sui to join forces with Yang Monkey Boy's bandit troops and launch an attack when the time is right.

<h3>Shandong-Hebei Border Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>(Public and Private Rights Equally Divided, Representatives from Two Provinces Survey and Demarcate the Border)</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Recently, the people of Wudi in northern Shandong and Yanshan in southern Hebei have been in dispute over 150 hectares of land, and the dispute has not been resolved. The governments of the two provinces also feel that it is necessary to clarify the provincial border. Therefore, they sent representatives to Jinan to negotiate several times. Both sides presented evidence, but the problem could not be resolved. Finally, Han Fuju, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, proposed that there was no need to argue any further. The 150 hectares of land should be divided in the middle, with each province getting 75 hectares. Public and private rights should be divided accordingly. This method was telegraphed to Yu Xuezhong, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, for approval. Yu has replied by telegram agreeing to it, and has appointed Li Xiaoshan and Shi Mou as representatives of Hebei Province to redraw the provincial border. Han has appointed Councilor Zhao Yunxie as the representative of Shandong Province, and they will go to the junction of Wudi and Yanshan on the 7th to survey and demarcate the border, bury boundary stones, and permanently end the dispute.

<h3>Korea Hopes to Catch the Murderer in the Zhang Case Within Three Months</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Instructs Han to Catch the Murderer</p>
<p>Replacements Not Yet Studied</p>
<p>Zhang's Father, Hexuan, Has Arrived in Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since Zhang Weicun was assassinated on the 2nd of this month, the search for the murderer is ongoing. The provincial government previously offered a reward of 20,000 yuan for those who report inside information that leads to the solving of the case, and 50,000 yuan for those who can fully confess and solve the case. Today (6th), an additional article was added: those involved in the case who can surrender and report will be exempted from punishment and will be given a reward of 10,000 yuan. As for the suspects detained at the Jinde Association on the evening of the 2nd, most have been released. Those who are slightly more suspicious are still under investigation. Han Fuju, chairman of the provincial government, also summoned Zhang's driver and asked about the situation on the way from the Huangting Stadium to the Jinde Association on that day. It is said that nothing was found either. Today (6th), when reporters visited Han, Han said, (Since the death of Committee Member Zhang, many telegrams have been received from all parties. Today I received another telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, also instructing me to strictly catch the murderer. From my observation, it seems that the murderer will not be difficult to catch. I hope the case can be solved within three months. As for whether the vacancy of the Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Headquarters left by Committee Member Zhang after his death will be filled in order of succession, it must be studied and then decided. Who will fill the vacancy of the Provincial Government Committee Member has not yet been studied.)</p>
<p>After Zhang Weicun's death, his mother and wife were both in Jinan. His father, Hexuan, was in Linyi and was telegraphed to inform him. Although Zhang's body was dressed for burial, it was only covered with the party flag without a coffin lid, waiting for his father to see him. Today (6th) at 2:00 PM, Zhang's father rushed here, lifted the flag to take a look at the place where the coffin was placed, and cried bitterly. Later, he was dissuaded by relatives and friends, and then the coffin lid was closed. Zhang Hexuan went to the provincial government to meet Han, thanking him for his concern and asking him to catch the murderer. Han deeply comforted him. Li Tianni, Cao Junfeng, Li Wenzhai, and Supervisory Committee Member Zhang Zhuxi, the directors of the funeral preparation office, convened a meeting of the office staff today (6th) to discuss funeral matters.

<p>(Songjiang) Patrol Chief Arrested for Secretly Smoking Opium</p>
<p>Li Yingqiu, the patrol chief of the Shanyang Dispatch Office of the 9th Public Security Sub-Bureau, usually made his authority felt, abused penalties, and recently extorted money from the sales and smoking shops, causing deep resentment among the local people. There is also a team of the Shanyang Security Brigade, Qin Shihani's troops, stationed there. Usually, when patrols met, they exchanged passwords, but the patrol chief often ignored them, causing great damage to their relationship. Unexpectedly, last night (7th), the patrol chief was smoking opium in a private opium den opened by Feng Guihe, and was seen by the patrol team of the security team. Because he was a serving public official who privately smoked opium, which was illegal, he was immediately arrested and taken back to the team headquarters for temporary detention, awaiting the disposition of the Qin detachment leader upon his return to the headquarters. When the matter was heard by the County Public Security Bureau, believing that the truth was still unknown, they sent personnel to Shanyang to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and await verification.</p>
<h3>Winter Follows Spring Order: Peach Trees Bloom</h3>
<p>The season is severe winter, but the weather is unusually warm, and ice and snow have not yet been seen. In general, old farmers are afraid that the rice stem borers will be discovered next spring, and the human body also feels uncomfortable. When winter follows the order of spring, it is also a rare creation for peach trees in the countryside to bloom.</p>
<p>(Jiading) Robbery and Injury Outside the West Gate</p>
<p>Song Jiting, a farmer in Pengjia Village, Lianxi Autonomous Experimental Township, outside the West Gate, is a man of modest means. At about 1:00 AM on the 8th, there were more than a dozen bandits, speaking in various accents, dressed as workers, holding flashlights and pistols. They first fired a shot as a warning, and then broke in through the side door, searching the rooms of his son and grandson, losing 870 yuan in cash, as well as gold rings, gold bracelets, and clothes, etc. Song himself was hung up, beaten, and scorched, forced to reveal the whereabouts of the hidden gold, and was seriously injured. His son, Baisheng, had his shoulder pierced by a gunshot. His granddaughter-in-law, Li, had her ear injured by the gold ring being pulled off. Afterwards, the West Gate Public Security Dispatch Office was informed. Inspector Wang Cunhou, on the one hand, telegraphed the Fangtai Public Security Dispatch Office to copy from the southwest to the northeast, and on the other hand, together with the local defense corps, copied from the Gaosheng Bridge and Zhaojing in two ways to the south. But the sky was already bright, and the bandits had fled far away.</p>
<h3>Winter Weather with Spring-like Conditions Causes Beans and Wheat to Flower</h3>
<p>Since the start of winter, the weather has been warm and mild, with drizzling rain, resembling the climate of spring. Rapeseed in the fields is budding and flowering, broad beans are laden with buds, and wheat seedlings are growing tall. Farmers are worried that if severe cold and frost occur, these tender branches and leaves will wither, making a good harvest unlikely.</p>
<p>(Suzhou) Weiting Blanket Production and Sales Cooperative Established</p>
<p>The handmade blanket industry in the Weiting area is the only handicraft industry in this county. During its peak, it was sold throughout the country, with huge sales volumes. The local Farmers Bank, in order to assist rural areas, plans to invest in revitalizing the industry. The Blanket Production and Sales Cooperative was established yesterday (the 8th). There are a total of 500 weaving households and 2,000 weavers in the area. Each household is a member unit, and one cooperative is established per village. A federation will be formed to govern the cooperatives, and a loan disbursement method has been determined to start investment. It is estimated that the first year of operation will have a surplus of 16,000 yuan. In the future, animal husbandry must also be operated to supply the wool needed locally.</p>
<p>High Court Schedules Retrial for Jin Shuren</p>
<p>The case of Jin Shuren, the former chairman of Xinjiang Province, has been sent to the Jiangsu High Court for repeated trials, but has not yet concluded. He is still detained in the capital. It is now learned that the High Court has scheduled a retrial for the 17th of this month at the Jiangning District Court. It is said that the trial is expected to conclude at that time.</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court to Move to Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court was reorganized from the High Court Procuratorate and has always been located on Daoqian Street in Suzhou. It is now reported that the Ministry of Justice has decided to move the court to Zhenjiang, with an estimated construction cost of 200,000 yuan. The Jiangsu Provincial Government will provide a subsidy of 30,000 yuan. The original Suzhou site is estimated to be sold for 110,000 yuan, leaving a shortfall of 60,000 yuan, which is currently being planned. Meanwhile, the new building for the Zhenjiang No. 5 Prison is being actively constructed to establish a High Court Detention Center after the High Court moves, to house defendants from various places who are sent there to appeal their cases.</p>
<p>(Wuxi) Agreement Reached on Key Points for Labor Conscription for River Dredging</p>
<p>Zhang Fulin, Director of the Construction Bureau of this county, was summoned to the provincial capital the other day to discuss matters related to the third Wuxi labor conscription for river dredging. As a result, the following three points were agreed upon: (1) The water level of the canal measured in Wuxi is still deep, so dredging will be postponed for the time being. However, the section from Wumu to Shitangwan, which borders Wujin, has already silted up and will be dredged by the province. The Wuxi Construction Bureau should still assist with design and other matters. (2) The silting situation of Huangtiangang was already seen during the floods and droughts this year. The Jiangyin County Government will conduct a survey to prepare for dredging. The Xicheng Canal in Wuxi, which connects to Huangtiangang, has a definite connection, and the Wuxi Construction Bureau should conduct a survey and draw a map to determine whether dredging is necessary based on the actual water level. (3) Wuxi's labor relief dredging of the six major rivers, namely Lujiang, Changguangxi, Nanma Port, Lijian River, Beixingtang River, and Hantang River, and the Xizhang section, is approved. However, the originally planned expenses for building dams and draining water, although budgeted and approved, seem to be slightly larger than those of other counties and should be reduced appropriately to ensure uniformity. The requested subsidy of 15,000 yuan from the province is approved.</p>
<p>Annual Fire Statistics</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Firefighting Federation of this county, there were a total of 140 fires in the 23rd year, of which 111 broke through the roof, and 343 houses were burned down, including 162 straw sheds. Fires were extinguished in time in 28 cases. Three households were insured and handled the claims themselves, and four households were affected. The total insured amount was 68,000 yuan. A total of 13 men, women, old people, and children were burned to death, and 5 people were injured. During the fierce fires, 5 people were rescued, and 15 firefighters were injured. The total loss of houses and property is estimated at more than 315,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Total Number of Land Price Declaration Households</p>
<p>The Wuxi Urban Land Price Declaration Office, after closing the declaration on the 15th of last month, immediately began reviewing the submissions. A total of 24,315 declaration forms were received. However, the review revealed two difficulties: (1) The boundaries of farmland were often difficult to fill in. (2) The house numbers and locations of residences were also not filled in according to the format. Certificates cannot be issued after the announcement, and ownership is also difficult to determine. The office has already notified all households to make corrections. Previously, residents such as Cao Quan and others filed an administrative appeal to the Ministry of Interior based on the Land Law. The Ministry of Interior held that the Suzhou province's handling of urban land price declarations was not aimed at collecting land value tax but was a trial run. The procedures were not inappropriate, and they did not conflict with the Land Law. Therefore, in accordance with Article 8 of the Appeal Law, the appeal was rejected.</p>
<p>(Jiangyin) Robbery at Mopundun in Southern Suburbs</p>
<p>Sun Shi'e, a resident of Yujiaqiao, Masi Township, hired a boat to come to the city on the 5th. When the boat was near Mopundun on Wuyun Bridge in the southern suburbs, three bandits suddenly came aboard, claiming to be inspectors. They searched the boat and robbed clothing and bedding, as well as four dou of white rice. Sun Shi'e is a wealthy man from Yujiaqiao. Fortunately, he had already entered the city and did not suffer any losses. The first substation of the local public security bureau was nearby. After hearing the report, they went to investigate and then reported to the bureau for investigation by the county.</p>
<p>(Changzhou) Construction Department Inspects Long-Distance Buses</p>
<p>Because long-distance buses in various counties have not been inspected since they started operating, the Jiangsu Construction Department will conduct a general inspection in the 24th year to ensure safety. Buses that are dilapidated and unfit for operation will be ordered to stop operating to avoid endangering the safety of travelers. Yao Daru has been appointed to be in charge of this matter. The county government has been ordered to inform the automobile companies to repair all vehicles and await inspection and operation. Yesterday (the 5th), the county government followed the department's order and instructed the Zhenyang Automobile Company to repair all vehicles and wait for inspection before operating.</p>
<p>Rewards and Punishments for Land Reporting</p>
<p>Magistrate Ma of Jiangdu County worked hard to urge land reporting. Although a misunderstanding was caused by the military's surveying in the three districts, after the explanation was given and the situation calmed down, he strictly urged the directors of each district to expedite the process. It has now been found that the districts and townships that have not yet completed the task will be rewarded or punished accordingly. The Gongdaoqiao township in the Eighth District was the first to complete the reporting and received a commendation. The Zhenzhong, Wufu, Chongde, Nanhe, Xuejia, Kangshan, and Fengxiang townships in the First District have also completed the task and received a commendation. The Dayi township in the Eighth District, the Jifeng township in the Third District, the Yiling township in the Sixth District, townships 1 and 2, Yonghe Township 1 in Districts 4, 8, 10, and 11, and Wanshou Township 3 have all completed the task, and the district offices are engaged in adjudication. However, the work in the township offices in the Fourth District is abnormally slow. Magistrate Ma believes that the director of the district, Gao Xinpan, has a wait-and-see attitude and has failed to supervise effectively. He was given a major demerit as a warning.</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Civil Affairs Department Trains Township Heads from Southern Jiangsu Counties</p>
<p>In Jiangsu Province, the household registration and baojia organization work in the northern Jiangsu counties was started earlier, and the first phase of work has been largely completed. The Civil Affairs Department ordered the establishment of training classes for township heads, with each period limited to three phases for rotating concentrated training. Currently, counties such as Tongshan have been operating for two to three months or more. Because the baojia organization in the southern Jiangsu counties started later, this training work has not yet been carried out. It is reported that it will begin next month, and the Civil Affairs Department will directly send personnel to the southern Jiangsu counties to conduct training. The baojia chiefs are the basic personnel for implementing baojia, and it is also planned to provide them with training at the same time. It is also reported that an order has been issued to each county that once the third phase of baojia work is completed, household registration changes should be carried out. In urban areas and towns where more sound public security agencies have been established, the public security agencies should be responsible for handling the changes, with the assistance of the district, township, and baojia chiefs. In areas where no public security agencies have been established or where they have been established but are not sound, the district, township, and baojia chiefs are responsible for handling the changes.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Tobacco Seedlings in the Xuzhou and Haizhou Areas</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department believes that most of the tobacco seedlings in the province are planted in the Xuzhou and Haizhou areas. Although there have been repeated bans, the results have been minimal. In order to completely eradicate the seedlings,</p>
<p>the department has sent investigators Wang Guobin, Shen Deren, and Long Shuying to strictly prohibit planting in various counties of Baohai. If any are found, they will be dealt with by military law.</p>
<p>Tightening of Government Spending in Liyang and Other Counties</p>
<p>Because the southern Jiangsu counties have been affected by drought, the income from land taxes has been greatly reduced. The provincial government ordered each county to reduce spending as appropriate within the original budget. According to reports, Liyang, Zhenjiang, Lishui, Jintan, Yixing, Jiangpu, Liuhe, and more than a dozen other counties have implemented this measure, with a total reduction of more than 200,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The family of Sun Huanzhi in this city hired a boat the other day to move his eldest son to Songjiang. When the boat was sailing to Changsankouzi, it was suddenly met by five bandits wearing blue military uniforms and speaking with a Hakka accent. They held sharp weapons and ordered the boat to stop. They robbed everything on board, and the boatmen were all beaten. The incident has been reported to the authorities for investigation.</p>
<p>(Jiaxing) Leather Goods Store's Books Kept by Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The two leather goods stores, Beililanxiang and Beidajie Xiangtai in Jiaxing, are solely owned by Wang Yongsen. However, due to poor business in recent years, the losses have been huge. As the end of the lunar year approaches, various suppliers are coming to Jiaxing to settle accounts. The owner of the store found it difficult to maintain the business and left a letter and fled the other day. The two stores closed the day before yesterday. A total of more than 23,000 yuan is owed to suppliers and depositors, but the inventory of the two stores is only worth more than 3,000 yuan. The current inventory and books have been kept by the county chamber of commerce. A meeting of creditors will be convened in the next few days.</p>

<h3>Personal Opinions on Revising the Current Trademark Law (Continued) by He Zhuoxian</h3>
<p>3. Regarding the Issue of Trademark Use in China</p>
<p>China's industry and commerce are still in their infancy and cannot compete with the European and American countries where capitalism has developed to its peak. Anyone who pays attention to the world economy and the domestic economic situation can understand this situation. Therefore, in addition to protecting trademark exclusive rights, China's trademark law should also take into account the fundamental shortcomings of the national economy and have a spirit of encouraging the nascent industry and commerce. This goes without saying. The current trademark law permits the registration of the actual first user for identical or similar trademarks (see Article 3 of the Trademark Law), and trademarks that have been used in good faith for more than ten years have the right of priority in registration (Article 4 of the same law). However, if the so-called actual first use and use in good faith for ten years are not restricted, I am afraid that the beneficiaries will not necessarily be the backward domestic industrial and commercial circles, but rather the advanced foreign industrialists and businessmen. China's industrial and commercial development is slow, and merchants have only recently paid attention to trademarks for the past three or four years. However, in European and American countries, after the industrial revolution and the high degree of development of capitalism, the progress of industry and commerce is ten times that of China. Their attention to trademarks is at least half a century earlier than China's. Apart from a few old brands, I dare say that there are not many Chinese trademarks that have a long history of use like those of foreign countries. Under these circumstances, if a Chinese trademark accidentally coincides with a foreign trademark, if the use is less than ten years, it will inevitably be completely defeated by the long history of use of the foreign trademark. Furthermore, if a Chinese trademark has already been registered and a foreign merchant applies to register an identical or similar trademark in China, relying on its history of use in a foreign country, it can use the adjudication procedure (see Article 30, Section 1 of the Trademark Law) to revoke the Chinese trademark that has already been registered. I cannot deny that the greatest function of trademark law is to protect trademark exclusive rights, but when we consider the domestic economic situation and are shocked by the cruelty of economic aggression against China by capitalist countries, we always feel that it is unacceptable for foreign merchants to use their long history of trademark use in their home countries to overwhelm Chinese trademarks (this trend should not be allowed to continue). A good law must fulfill its legal mission, such as a trademark law must be able to protect trademark exclusive rights. However, on the other hand, the law of a country must have characteristics that are suitable for the national conditions of the country in order to be considered complete and without regrets. The current trademark law does not restrict the issue of trademark use, which seems to be a regret from the point of view of (suitability to national conditions). In order to remedy</p>
<p>this shortcoming, I propose that the facts of trademark use should be limited to the facts of use within the territory of China. Then, Article 3 and Article 4 of the current trademark law regarding the order of trademark use should be restricted to (within the territory of the Republic of China). If so, the original articles should be changed to (When two or more persons submit separate applications for registration, the registration shall be granted to the actual first user within the territory of the Republic of China; ...) (Article 3) and (Trademarks that have been used in good faith for more than ten years within the territory of the Republic of China, ...) (Article 4).</p>
<p>4. Regarding Other Issues</p>
<p>(A) Article 19, Paragraph 1, Section 1 of the current Trademark Law stipulates that if a merchant changes his registered trademark without authorization or adds a footnote to use it by means of imagery, the Trademark Bureau may, by virtue of its authority or at the request of interested parties, impose a revocation penalty. This article seems to only bind registered trademarks and cannot bind approved but unregistered trademarks. In fact, registered trademarks and approved trademarks have different times; approved trademarks are published in the Trademark Gazette for six months, and only when there are no objections from interested parties, or the objections have been clarified, can they be registered (see Article 27 of the Trademark Law). Judging from the wording of Article 19, Paragraph 1, Section 1, the so-called registered trademark can be interpreted as (a registered trademark). If this is the case, the Trademark Bureau cannot take action against the unauthorized changes or addition of footnotes to approved trademarks to use it by means of imagery. This has to be said that there are loopholes in the current trademark law. To remedy this loophole, I propose adding (The provisions of Section 1 of the preceding paragraph shall apply to approved trademarks) after Section 3 of Paragraph 1 of Article 19.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the trademarks that have been used in good faith for more than ten years as stipulated in Article 4 of the current Trademark Law, I have already advocated above that the restriction of use in China should be added. However, after careful consideration, even if there is a restriction on use in China, the privilege granted to trademarks that have been used in good faith for more than ten years is still inevitably too lenient. The so-called use in good faith is that the two words in good faith originally have no certain definition and are ultimately too abstract. Because there is no certain definition, it is difficult to make an accurate estimate of good faith and bad faith. If a merchant deliberately imitates a registered trademark of another person and writes a record of more than ten years of use in his account books in advance and applies for registration with the Trademark Bureau, the Trademark Bureau relies on the record of more than ten years of use in his account books. The account books are indeed true, and it is difficult to find out where his bad faith lies, unless an interested party presents strong counter-evidence to clarify that it is not out of good faith. The Trademark Bureau may not necessarily approve the registration of this type of trademark, but this type of merchant who deliberately imitates other people's trademarks can always take advantage of the opportunity to apply for registration of his trademark to sell goods that are actually imitated, and the legal rights of the registered trademark of others will inevitably suffer great losses. For example, if a merchant acts as an agent for the sale of goods of a certain trademark, he can record the trademark name in the account books and omit the word (agent for sale). After ten years, this agent can apply for registration of the trademark according to Article 4 of the Trademark Law. Under this circumstance, although he is actually embezzling the trademark of others, the only evidence for the competent authority to handle this type of trademark registration - commonly known as (Article 4 registration) - is the account books, and the account books clearly have a record of more than ten years of trademark use, which is as seamless as a heavenly garment, and there are no signs of bad faith to be found. As a result, it is difficult to reject its registration. Judging from the above two examples, it can be seen that good faith is an abstract regulation without a definite definition, and it can cause abuses in every respect. Originally, this article was to give a right of priority in registration to those trademarks with a long history of use before the promulgation of the Trademark Law. After the promulgation of the Trademark Law, all trademarks can be applied for registration in accordance with Article 1 of the Trademark Law. If there is indeed a history of use, it is not impossible to obtain exclusive rights in accordance with Article 3 of the Trademark Law. Therefore, I advocate that the article in Article 4 should be prefixed with the words (Before the implementation of this law) so that cunning merchants cannot rely on this law to carry out disguised imitation. (C) There are special articles in the criminal law for handling counterfeit trademarks, and the jurisdiction belongs to courts at all levels. The Trademark Bureau originally has no right to handle them. However, in cases of counterfeit trademarks, the courts, on the one hand, have no experience in handling trademarks, and on the other hand, they have no files to check. Once they accept the case, they cannot judge its authenticity. Therefore, in the 18th year of the Republic of China, the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce asked the Ministry of Justice to issue a circular to courts at all levels that they should consult the Trademark Bureau before adjudicating trademark lawsuits (see Circular No. 812 of the Ministry of Justice). This method is still being implemented. However, in the minds of most merchants, they always believe that the Trademark Bureau is the only authority to handle trademark matters. When their registered trademark is counterfeited, if the other party's trademark has also been submitted for registration, objections can be raised after approval (Article 27 of the Trademark Law), and adjudication can also be requested after registration (Article 30 of the same law). However, if the counterfeit trademark has not been submitted for registration, they will request the Trademark Bureau to identify the authenticity so that they can file a lawsuit with the court. In the past, the Trademark Bureau has only issued a certificate called (Identification Certificate) for this type of request for identification in accordance with the provisions of Article 36, Section 11 of the Implementing Rules of the Trademark Law. In addition to which of the trademarks of the two parties has been submitted for registration, who has not submitted for registration, and whether they are identical or similar, two copies of the trademark patterns of both parties are also attached. This method is originally very common because it can facilitate merchants to file lawsuits with the court and save the court from consulting the Trademark Bureau again. However, under which article of the current Trademark Law is the (Identification Certificate) issued? I cannot find it after searching the current Trademark Law. I strongly advocate this method of issuing (Identification Certificate) because it is indeed needed in fact, but I do not approve of the competent authority doing things that are not based on law. Therefore, I very much hope that this article will be added to the current Trademark Law (When a trademark that has not been submitted for registration is identical or similar to a registered trademark, the interested party may request the Trademark Bureau to identify it).</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, I dare not say that I have pointed out all the imperfections in the current trademark law, and I dare not admit that I have drafted a complete and close plan for revising the current trademark law. However, I feel that due to the evolution of the times, the current trademark law does have some shortcomings in completing the two missions of (protecting trademark exclusive rights) and (adapting to China's national conditions). I am a person who firmly advocates revising the current trademark law. Whether my views can be adopted by the legislative authorities is another question. However, if this article can attract considerable attention from the manufacturers and businesses, or if someone comes forward to discuss the various issues of the current trademark law in more detail, this would be my deepest wish.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee Purchases Huge Amount of Silver for Shipment to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Total of 20 Million for Market Stabilization</p>
<p>Further Purchases Required if Situation Persists</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, a huge amount of silver was purchased from Hong Kong and shipped to Shanghai to stabilize the market. The silver is about to arrive in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Tight Money Supply) The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, entrusted by the Ministry of Finance, jointly formed the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, which was established on October 19 of last year. The address is located inside the Central Bank of China on the Bund. The committee publishes the exchange equalization rate every day. In view of the extremely tight money supply in Shanghai, the foreign exchange rate in the money market once rose to six jiao. Although the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications designated 10 million yuan to be lent to the money and banking industries to stabilize the financial situation, the money supply has eased slightly. Yesterday, the foreign exchange rate dropped to four jiao, but it has not fully retreated.</p>
<p>(Stabilizing Market Prices) Special committee members Xi Demao, Bei Songsun, and Zhang Peishen consulted and decided that in order to stabilize market prices, in accordance with Article 4 of the organizational outline (The committee may entrust the Central Bank of China to buy and sell foreign exchange and bullion in order to stabilize the market according to market needs) and Article 5 (The committee may entrust the Central Bank of China to import and export gold and silver when necessary), it is planned to purchase silver and ship it to Shanghai to stabilize the market.</p>
<p>(Purchasing Silver) Xin Sheng News Agency reporters learned from banking circles yesterday that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee's purchase of silver and shipment to Shanghai to stabilize the market has become a reality. The committee has entrusted the Central Bank of China to purchase silver from Hong Kong. All procedures are underway. Once successful, the silver will be loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai, with a total amount of approximately 20 million yuan. It may arrive in Shanghai within the week.</p>
<p>(To Meet Needs) At the same time, the committee may ship silver to Shanghai at any time according to market needs. It has now been decided that after the first batch of approximately 20 million yuan arrives in Shanghai, further purchases of silver will be made and shipped to Shanghai if the market continues to need it. However, the previous rumor that foreign banks such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank would ship silver back from Hong Kong has not yet materialized because the issue of waiving taxes and exchange equalization tax when the silver is exported again in the future has not been resolved.</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin Sends Representative to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Chonghui Waits for Sun Ke to Discuss</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the national peace and unity work has been progressing since Dr. Wang Chonghui traveled north and south. Wang recently visited Chairman Chiang in Fenghua again, and the results of the talks were promising. Wang telegraphed Hu Hanmin about the progress. It is now learned that Hu has specially sent a representative from Hong Kong to Shanghai a few days ago to be responsible for contacting everything. Wang Chonghui told Xin Sheng News Agency reporters yesterday afternoon that he is currently waiting to meet with Hu's representative and said that everything is waiting for President Sun Zheisheng to come to Shanghai for discussions and decisions. He has already left Pingnan and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th. He originally planned to take the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso on the 15th to travel abroad as soon as possible, but whether he can travel by the deadline is yet to be determined.</p>
<h3>Factory Inspection in the Concession to be Resolved Soon</h3>
<p>Cheng Haifeng, Director of the Chinese Branch of the International Labour Organization</p>
<p>Suggested Solutions Expected to be Adopted by Both Parties</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a person in charge of relevant aspects said to the Central News Agency reporters yesterday morning that the factory inspection issue in the city is being negotiated by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Concession Work Bureau. Later, the Ministry of Industry, in order to facilitate the process, also sent personnel to participate. The negotiations were initially very smooth, and everything had been gradually discussed and resolved. However, the issue of factory inspector guidance has not yet been fully resolved. After several consultations, it was decided that the factory inspectors should be under the guidance of the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government and the Secretary-General of the Work Bureau. However, the Board of Directors of the Work Bureau expressed opposition to this, and the matter was delayed. Cheng Haifeng, Director of the Chinese Branch of the International Labour Organization, before going to Hong Kong and Guangdong for inspection, suggested to both parties as a third party in order to resolve the case as soon as possible that a committee should be jointly formed by the First and Second Special Zones and the Municipal Government for the factory inspector guidance issue. As for all labor laws and regulations, they should all be based on Chinese law. Factory inspectors should also be commissioned by the Central Factory Inspection Office. At the same time, factory inspectors must submit a monthly work report to the Central Factory Inspection Office. It is expected that the program will be adopted by all parties, so the case can be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>Content of Shanghai West Electricity Supply Contract</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the long-pending Shanghai West electricity supply issue was resolved by signing a contract between the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai West Electricity Company on the 4th of this month. It is now learned that the price paid by the company for the franchise is 1.5 million yuan. The business period is set at 30 years. When the period expires, the municipal government may take over the entire company at an appraised price and return the prepaid money of 1.5 million yuan at the same time, but without interest. The company will pay 5% of its annual income to the municipal government as business remuneration. It is also heard that the contract stipulates that 49% of the company's shares should belong to Chinese investment.</p>
<h3>法租界 Chinese Ratepayers Request to Increase Chinese Board Members</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a letter was sent to the French Consul-General requesting fulfillment of a previous agreement.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of increasing Chinese board members in the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, Chairman Du Yuesheng had previously approached French Consul-General Meyrier last year. As a result of these discussions, Consul-General Meyrier agreed to add one member initially to appease public expectations. However, much time has passed without this promise being fulfilled. Therefore, the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to the French Consul-General yesterday, requesting that the previous agreement be honored. The original letter is extracted below: To the Esteemed Consul-General: Previously, our Association compared the number of Chinese board members in the French Concession to the tax amounts paid by Chinese and foreign residents and the population ratio of residents in the concession, as stipulated by the French Municipal Council. It seemed greatly unfair that the Chinese citizens' tax obligations and their right to participate in municipal elections and council deliberations were not proportional. We sent a letter requesting that Your Excellency increase the number of Chinese board members accordingly. Subsequently, last year, our Association's Chairman, Mr. Du Yuesheng, applied based on this request, and Your Excellency agreed to add one member initially to appease public expectations. However, much time has passed, and the citizens' anticipation is high. We are sending this special letter to request that Your Excellency honor the previous agreement and grant approval promptly so that we may comply. We eagerly await your response.</p>
<h3>Italian Ambassador Visits Embassy Yesterday for Inspection</h3>
<p>A copy of the Letter of Credence was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>The establishment of the embassy in Nanjing or Shanghai is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the first Italian Ambassador to China, Vincenzo Arangio Ruiz, arrived in Shanghai with his family the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he visited the embassy office for inspection. He has also begun copying the Letter of Credence to be forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before proceeding to Nanjing. The location of the embassy, whether in Nanjing or Shanghai, has not yet been determined. The embassy office in Shanghai will remain in its current state for the time being. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Inspection of the Embassy) At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, Mr. Ruiz, accompanied by his private secretary, Baron Seddio, and Mr. Gabaglio, the aviation attache, along with Italian Minister to China, Mr. Paulucci di Calboli, visited the embassy office at 555 Jing'an Temple Road and the Consulate-General in Shanghai. He introduced the new and old embassy staff. He returned to his residence for rest at noon.</p>
<p>(Copy of the Letter of Credence) The date of the Ambassador's arrival in Nanjing has not yet been determined. According to diplomatic procedures, an incoming ambassador must first submit a copy of the Letter of Credence to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing for review. Then, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requests an audience date from the Chairman of the National Government. This process is complex and cannot be completed in a day or two. Therefore, the exact date of the Ambassador's arrival in Nanjing is currently unknown. However, according to embassy sources yesterday, the Chinese secretary, Mr. Rossi, has begun copying the Letter of Credence after the Italian Ambassador's arrival. Once completed, it will be sent to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for forwarding to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing for review.</p>
<p>(Arrival Date in Nanjing) According to sources at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the date of Ambassador Ruiz's arrival in Nanjing will be decided by Mr. Ruiz after receiving instructions from Nanjing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will only request an audience date from Chairman Lin Sen after reviewing the copy of the Letter of Credence and then inform Ambassador Ruiz. Ambassador Ruiz will then choose the date of his arrival in Nanjing. However, in any case, he must arrive in Nanjing one or two days before presenting the Letter of Credence. Yesterday, the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report his arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Embassy Location) The location of the embassy, whether in Nanjing or Peiping, has not yet been determined. However, according to a spokesperson for the Italian Embassy, the embassy may not be located in Peiping in the future. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously instructed the Italian Legation to move to Shanghai due to the inconvenience of having the legation in Peiping. Therefore, the establishment of the embassy will be either in Nanjing or Shanghai. Until the embassy's location is determined, the Shanghai Legation will remain in its current state.</p>
<p>(Minister Paulucci Returns Home) In addition, the former Italian Minister to China, Mr. Paulucci di Calboli, has reportedly been transferred to work within the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He will depart Shanghai on the Italian liner Conte Rosso on the 15th of this month with his secretary, Mr. Visconti. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a farewell banquet for Mr. Paulucci a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Line Increases Flights</h3>
<p>Two round trips per week</p>

<p>An indication of international competition on Far East shipping routes</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Yugoslavian ship "Trieste" (3,853 tons), which sails between Europe and the east coast of the Americas, recently arrived in Shanghai carrying a large shipment of American lumber. This is the first time a Yugoslavian ship has arrived in China. The Yugoslavian shipping company currently has 23 ships and intends to establish a presence on the East Asian routes. Shipping circles in China are paying close attention to this development. The company's business in Shanghai will be handled by Tientsin Company at 1 Guangdong Road.</p>
<h3>French Consul-General Meyrier Pays Farewell Visit to Mayor Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>French Consul-General in Shanghai, Meyrier, whose transfer to another post has been approved, is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the French liner La Marseillaise on the 12th of this month to return to France. Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a farewell banquet for Mr. Meyrier a few days ago. Mr. Meyrier personally visited the Municipal Government at 11:00 AM yesterday to bid farewell to Mayor Wu.</p>
<h3>Fessenden Resumes Duties Yesterday After Leave</h3>
<p>Negotiations on extending roads and factory inspections will continue</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, negotiations on extending roads and factory inspections, which have progressed significantly through several meetings between Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and Shanghai Municipal Council Secretary-General Fessenden, were temporarily suspended due to Mr. Fessenden's leave to return home. It has been learned that Mr. Fessenden returned to Shanghai after his leave ended on the 7th and resumed his duties yesterday morning. It is reported that both parties have decided to schedule a meeting in the coming days to continue discussions and find a solution to expedite the resolution of this matter.</p>
<h3>Inventory of Palace Museum Artifacts Resumes After New Year</h3>
<p>The inventory of artifacts from the Peiping Palace Museum stored in Shanghai, which was suspended due to the New Year holiday, has resumed. Supervisor Shu Chushi also went to Nanjing before the New Year. It has been learned that Mr. Shu returned to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 7th, and the work of inventorying the artifacts resumed yesterday. Twelve boxes of porcelain and one box of enamelware were inventoried in the morning.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Plans to Join International Load Line Convention</h3>
<p>A pioneering step towards integrating China's shipping industry internationally</p>
<p>In the past, China did not join the International Load Line Convention because its shipping industry was still in its infancy. In recent years, domestic shipping companies have been striving for development, and their relationship with international shipping vessels is becoming increasingly close. To promote international navigation and safeguard the safety of people and property at sea, the authorities advocate joining the convention. Thirty countries have already joined. The Ministry of Communications has drafted measures and submitted them to the National Government for review. This is a pioneering step in integrating the domestic shipping industry internationally. It is reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will implement it in the future.</p>
<h3>Certificates Issued to Pilots in the Songhu District Are Invalidated</h3>
<p>New certificates will be issued to qualified individuals.</p>
<p>All pilots are allowed to retake the exam.</p>
<p>Previously, pilots in the Songhu district petitioned against the unfairness of the pilot management committee's exam. Now, the Pilot Management Committee has granted them the right to retake the exam and issued a public notice stating: It is hereby announced that all Chinese pilots in the Songhu district have been placed under the management of this committee by order of the government. All previous certificates issued in the Songhu district are immediately invalidated. All pilots residing in Shanghai or near Shanghai must submit their original certificates to the Songhu District Pilot Office on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs House for cancellation within ten days from the date of this announcement. Pilots performing duties between Zhenjiang and Hankou must do so within thirty days from the date of this announcement. Qualified pilots will be issued new certificates by this committee free of charge. After the aforementioned deadline, anyone found using an old certificate to perform pilot duties or any vessel employing a pilot who has not obtained a new certificate issued by this committee will be punished according to the provisional regulations on pilot management. This announcement is hereby issued for general information. When applying for a new certificate, qualified pilots must submit two recent half-length photos (approximately 4.5 cm wide and 6.3 cm long). Please comply accordingly. Chairman Canal, January 7, 1935.</p>
<h3>New Initiatives of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau</h3>
<p>Adopting scientific methods for managing files</p>
<p>Implementing a linked document and file management system</p>
<p>Since Mr. Tang Baoshu and Mr. Xu Baiyuan took office as Director-General and Deputy Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, they have been making tireless efforts to reorganize the affairs of all departments. Details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Recently, in view of the needs of the times, the Bureau decided to adopt purely scientific methods for managing files and implement a linked document and file management system starting this year. The intention is to achieve the highest efficiency in administrative management with the least manpower, the least financial resources, and the most economical time. It is reported that this latest method is largely the brainchild of Section Chief Wang of the third section of the General Affairs Department. At a time when the central government is vigorously advocating the application of scientific management methods to improve administrative efficiency, this move by the Bureau can be said to be at the forefront of the trend.</p>
<h3>Reconstruction of Songjiang Station Overpass by Two Railway Bureaus to Commence Soon</h3>
<p>The overpass at Songjiang Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has been in use for over fifteen years. To ensure the safety of passengers, the Railway Bureau has ordered the Engineering Department to dismantle and rebuild it. It has been learned that bidding has been completed, a manufacturer has been selected, and construction will begin soon. Residents of Songjiang, including Mr. Li Fangmei, have suggested to the Railway Bureau that it deploy more railway police to advise passengers to wait on the platform after alighting from the train until the train has left the station before crossing the tracks to exit, in order to avoid danger, while the bridge construction is underway. The Railway Bureau has accepted this suggestion and ordered the railway police to comply.</p>
<h3>Banks and Shops Actively Collecting Emergency Relief Donations</h3>
<p>The Emergency Relief Donation Committee has recently received numerous donations collected by newspapers, banks, money shops, companies, and shops.

Most of the generous donors sent the amount to the Committee as agreed, showing great enthusiasm. It was learned that Mr. Chen Bingqian donated $1,000 yesterday and Mr. Cheng Yize donated $500, both sending people to deliver the donations to the Committee for verification. It was learned that a few generous donors have not yet responded or paid the donation immediately. The Committee has verified this and sent separate letters urging them to do so. It is hoped that the matter will be completed within a few days, otherwise a public announcement will be made at a meeting and alternative measures will be taken.</p>
<p>The Candle Industry Association donated $78 from all its members, Minghe Textile Factory donated $118.88, the copper workshop and warehouse of General Electric Edison Appliance Company donated $21.02, and the China Educational Supplies Manufacturing Factory donated $108.18.

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests the City Government to Reduce the License Tax on Medicinal Liquor</h3>
<p>Used for treatment,</p>
<p>Not comparable to consumables</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the municipal government yesterday stating: This report is submitted to request a factual investigation. On the 7th of this month, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Industry Association submitted a report stating, "The association had previously received reports from members Yu Liangxin, Zhirentang, and Songshoutang stating that medicinal liquor in Chinese pharmacies is specifically used for treating illnesses and is not comparable to consumables. Requiring the same license fee, ranging from four to two yuan, does not seem to align with the principle of using taxation for regulation. Recently, there has been an increase in the tax rate, and members have suffered greatly from the economic downturn in recent years, with business declining sharply. They are already struggling to survive and cannot afford to bear additional burdens. For example, Yu Liangxin Co. originally paid four yuan per quarter in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax, but this fall they were suddenly ordered to pay the Class A tax, doubling the amount. Class A tax should be paid by those who operate stores exclusively selling all kinds of alcohol, but Yu Liangxin is clearly a Chinese pharmacy and has no basis to pay the Class A tax. This has caused confusion for businesses. Zhirentang, Songshoutang, and others have weak capital and a small scope of business. The economy has become increasingly depleted after the war, making it difficult to survive by taking from one area to make up for another. They originally paid two yuan per quarter in tax, which was a reasonable and compassionate assessment of their actual situation, classifying them as Class C. This fall, they were also subject to double taxation, like tired horses being given a heavy load. The future is bleak, and the struggle is increasingly difficult." The association believes that the decline in the Chinese medicine industry is a well-known fact in society and is a natural phenomenon under the shadow of economic recession. However, their energy is depleted, and their ability to bear burdens is extremely weak. On October 22nd, the association submitted a report to the municipal government requesting that the license tax on medicinal liquor be exempted, but no reply has been received to date. Now, the Laolaiyi Chinese Pharmacy on Doushi Street in Nanshi has sent a letter stating that they were fined eight yuan for overdue payment of the license during the requested exemption period and were also required to pay an additional eight yuan for the Class A alcohol license tax. This is consistent with what Yu Liangxin reported, and since the request for exemption was submitted before the municipal government's approval, the situation is different from intentional delays and seems to be excusable. If the Finance Bureau investigates immediately and applies legal regulations, it will be very difficult for merchants. Therefore, a special report is submitted to the General Assembly, requesting that it forward it to the municipal government, which should understand the people's suffering, sympathize with merchants, and exempt Chinese pharmacies from the medicinal liquor license tax to alleviate their difficulties. The fine imposed on Laolaiyi should be refunded, as it is beneficial to the public." According to this, after investigation, Chinese pharmacies specialize in selling medicines, and the various medicinal liquors they sell are also for treatment purposes. This is different from selling liquor in small quantities to consumers. The industry's request for exemption from the medicinal liquor license tax is not unreasonable. Moreover, according to Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol Business License Tax, merchants selling alcohol retail and requiring a Class A license are limited to those who operate stores selling all kinds of alcohol. Chinese pharmacies primarily sell medicines, and medicinal liquor is only one of their ancillary products. Now, they are also required to pay tax as Class A retailers, which is difficult for pharmacies to accept. Therefore, a factual report is submitted, requesting that your government review it and instruct the Finance Bureau to reduce or exempt the medicinal liquor license tax for Chinese pharmacies and to refund the fine imposed on Laolaiyi to alleviate merchants' difficulties, as it is beneficial to the public. Respectfully submitted, etc.</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief Donation Committee also received a reply from the Asia-American Weaving Factory stating that the workers' donations are being handled. Since the company's staff and workers are scattered in various factories, the withholding procedure is more complicated. After collecting them at the end of the month, they will be submitted to the Shanghai Bank.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Bank submitted donations collected from workers as of the 5th of this month, totaling $5,755.59, which was submitted to the Emergency Relief Donation Committee for verification.</p>
<h3>Selling New Stamp Tax Law Interpretations Under the False Name of the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Contents Are Full of Errors</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Has Requested a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, considering the stamp tax application methods to be extremely complex, previously compiled and printed a small booklet titled "(Answers to Doubts Regarding Stamp Tax)" based on the stamp tax regulations, for the convenience of merchants and the public. This booklet was sold by the Chamber's Commercial Monthly magazine, and those who purchased and read it found it convenient. Unexpectedly, after the new stamp tax law was enacted by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government, an entity calling itself the "Shanghai Commercial Research Institute" published a book titled "Interpretation of the New Stamp Tax Law." The bottom of the book was printed with the name of the representative, Wang Jinyao, as the publisher, and the general distribution location was listed as either the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazilu, or the side of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on North Suzhou Road. Furthermore, they printed separate lead-typed leaflets with the words "Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce" added next to "Shanghai Commercial Research Institute," and dispatched personnel to peddle the leaflets and books to various businesses in the city. Businesses, unaware of the situation, were often deceived. After the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce learned of this matter, the Commercial Monthly magazine immediately conducted a detailed investigation and discovered that there was no so-called "Shanghai Commercial Research Institute" at either the Bazilu intersection or North Suzhou Road. The "Interpretation of the New Stamp Tax Law" that they printed was also full of errors. This is because this new stamp tax law, although promulgated, has not yet been implemented, and there have already been revisions to the legal text. If businesses affix stamps based on this interpretation, they will inevitably be penalized. The Chamber of Commerce has reported this to the authorities and requested a thorough investigation, and has also announced the facts to prevent merchants and the public from being deceived.</p>
<h3>Zhu Rushan Enthusiastically Assists His Hometown with Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Rushan, a committee member of the Huining Shanghai Fellow-Countrymen Association Disaster Relief Committee, is a prominent gentleman from Jingyi residing in Shanghai. He has always been extremely enthusiastic about public welfare undertakings and is highly respected by people in society. This time, because his hometown suffered severe disasters and was also ravaged by the Red Bandits, the people were displaced and destitute, with nine out of ten homes empty, causing immense suffering. Mr. Zhu was deeply saddened by the disasters in his hometown and felt great compassion. Yesterday, he specially donated 1,000 yuan of silver to the Disaster Relief Committee for distribution in the disaster area. His generosity and chivalrous spirit are evident. It is reported that the Association will not only issue a receipt and send a letter of thanks but will also compile and publish his donation in the newspaper to commend his benevolence.</p>
<h3>The Salary Increase Issue for Western Crew Members of Taikoo and Other Western Ships Has Been Resolved, and Work Resumed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Another Arbitration Committee Has Been Formed to Decide</p>
<p>The Western crew members (captains, chief mates, second mates, third mates, chief engineers, first assistant engineers, second assistant engineers, and third assistant engineers) of the Taikoo Company's four vessels, namely the Foshan, Taishan, Jinshan, and Longshan, as well as the Tianyi Company's Tianyi vessel and the Tongan Company's Dongan and Xi'an vessels, went on strike on December 29th of last year due to their unsuccessful demands for annual salary increases from the companies. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited the seamen's association of the Seamen's Party, the seamen's union, the steerage workers' union, and other seamen's organizations and learned that the labor and management sides of the crew members had signed a resolution on the previous day to resolve the issue. The salary increase issue for each crew member will be decided by another arbitration committee. After the signing of the agreement, all ships resumed their voyages. Because the dispute was resolved satisfactorily, all crew members resumed work yesterday morning. However, due to the large accumulation of goods between Hong Kong and Guangdong after the strike, loading and unloading are quite busy.</p>
<h3>The Pacific Union Society Invites Powell to Give a Speech</h3>

<h3>The Suspect Zhang Wentian in the Murder Case of Mr. Shi Liangcai is Transferred to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Police Department Expresses Agreement to the Hangzhou County's Request for Transfer</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhang Wentian Requests a Speedy Trial</p>
<p>After Mr. Shi Liangcai, the general manager of this newspaper, was shot and assassinated on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, the Zhejiang Provincial Government offered a large reward and issued a wanted notice for the murderers, vowing to bring them to justice. Multiple suspects in the case have been arrested one after another and are currently under close investigation. Zhang Wentian, a resident of Yongyuan Lane on Tianjin Road in this city, originally from Tongzhou, also known as A'er, was found by the Procuratorate of the Hangzhou County Court to be suspected of being involved in the Shi case. They issued a document to the First Special District Court, requesting assistance in the arrest. The Special Court then issued Arrest Warrant No. 5344, which was handed over to the General Police Department. On December 29th of last year, at 11:00 AM, Detective Zhang Xiaolin was dispatched to Yongyuan Lane on Tianjin Road to arrest Zhang and take him to the police department. The next morning, he was escorted to the court for interrogation and detention. This information has already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the deadline for the continued hearing of this case arrived. The Procuratorate of the Hangzhou Regional Court also sent two bailiffs to present an official document requesting the transfer of the suspect. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang expressed agreement with the transfer. However, Chen Tingrui, Zhang's attorney, stood up and stated that Zhang has been a resident of the lane in Shanghai for more than twenty years and has never left Shanghai. Not only is he completely unacquainted with Shi Liangcai, but he has also never heard of his name and has absolutely no involvement in the matter. Now that the Hangzhou County Procuratorate has dispatched personnel to escort him, there is no objection. A fair judgment will definitely be obtained in the future. However, he requested a speedy conclusion to avoid innocent detention. Furthermore, this case is quite important, and all parties are paying close attention. Since the Hangzhou County authorities have offered a large reward for the arrest of the murderers, it is inevitable that there will be people who are greedy for profit and hope to obtain the huge reward by arbitrarily framing others. This point should be recorded clearly by the clerk for the reference of the Hangzhou County Court. After verifying and reporting to Judge Qian Hongye, the court immediately ordered that Zhang Wentian be allowed to be handed over to the personnel from the Hangzhou County Court Procuratorate to be taken back for investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Flights of China National Aviation Corporation Delayed Yesterday Due to Heavy Fog Along the Coast</h3>
<p>According to the Kwok Man News Agency, the weather was overcast yesterday, and heavy fog blanketed coastal areas. All flights of the China National Aviation Corporation were suspended yesterday. However, the Shanghai-Hankou route flew from Hankou to Shanghai at 8:00 AM and arrived in Nanjing at 12:35 PM. Later, due to adverse weather conditions on the Nanjing-Shanghai section, it could not come to Shanghai and returned to Hankou from Nanjing at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The company's Shanghai-Guangdong route added a Shanghai-Guangdong flight on Tuesdays and a Guangdong-Shanghai flight on Thursdays. The additions were originally scheduled to begin yesterday. Five passengers had already purchased tickets the day before, one destined for Wenzhou, three for Fuzhou, and one for Shantou. However, due to the weather yesterday, the No. 22 Fuzhou Douglas aircraft, piloted by pilot Foen, will fly from Shanghai to Guangdong this morning.</p>
<h3>The International Trade Bureau Introduces Raw Antimony and Peanuts</h3>
<p>Export Manufacturers Can Contact the Bureau</p>
<p>China's antimony production accounts for almost 80% of the world's total. The antimony from Shuikoushan in Changning County, Hunan Province, is of the purest quality and is an important raw material for manufacturing bullets and type metal. The Philippine Manila Red Star Automatic Machine Company has sent a letter requesting 20,000 pounds of primary antimony per year and inquiring about the CIF Manila delivery price. Export manufacturers who have this mineral for sale are encouraged to send a letter to the Bureau's Guidance Department for introduction. In addition, the peanuts produced in Shandong Province have a very rich oil content and are shipped to European and American countries in large quantities every year for oil extraction, cooking, and the production of artificial butter or as a substitute for olive oil. Recently, the Marseilles Import and Export Company of Ottawa, Canada, sent a letter requesting the purchase of 100-pound packages of peanuts. Export manufacturers are encouraged to contact the company.</p>
<h3>The Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Journalists Association Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the Dismissal of Employees by the Shih Pao</p>
<p>Unanimously Resolved Three Concrete Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association convened an emergency joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees at the Association's headquarters at 4:30 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of the Shih Pao dismissing a large number of employees.

After detailed discussion by the committee members present, the following was unanimously resolved: (1) Since Zhang Zhuping has not given a definite reply regarding reinstatement, it is necessary to take further necessary measures to achieve the goal of reinstatement. The three suggestions of the committee are extremely appropriate and are all approved. (2) The original four representatives will continue to negotiate with Zhang Zhuping for the last time, and the Assistance Committee is authorized to implement the three measures of the previous article when necessary. (3) The Assistance Committee may request the Standing Committee to convene a temporary membership meeting when necessary. (4) Tang Shichang, Zhao Junhao, Yu Kongwo, and Jiang Zongdao were additionally elected as members of the Assistance Committee.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Datong Correspondence School Accused of Fraudulent Acquisition of Property</h3>
<p>Both Sides Opened Debate Yesterday</p>
<p>The Court Ordered Wang Xingnan to Appear</p>
<p>Lu Yaoming, the president of the Datong Trust Bank Correspondence School, was criminally sued by Wang Xingnan and Wang Xingsheng, two brothers who claimed to be correspondence students of the school, through lawyers, for fraudulent acquisition of property. Lu Yaoming denied that the two Wangs were students of the school and also hired a lawyer to file a countersuit against the two Wangs, claiming that they were actually instigated by Xi Yuehan, the founder of the Chengxin Bank Correspondence School, to fabricate facts and falsely accuse him. He requested that the two Wangs be punished for false accusation. The First Special Court has repeatedly held hearings to investigate the situation, as reported in detail in previous issues. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiang Yinghua continued the hearing. Wang Xingnan was still absent, while Wang Xingsheng presented a letter, stating that it was sent by his younger brother Xingnan from Nanjing. The court then interrogated the defendant, Lu Yaoming, who stated that the Datong Correspondence School applied to the Municipal Education Bureau for registration on February 26th and announced its establishment at the same time. Students began registering on March 5th. Although the enrollment advertisement was published on January 14th, it stated that the registration with the Education Bureau had been approved, but the advertisement draft was written by the advertising company on his behalf. However, Wang Xingsheng and Wang Xingnan were definitely not students of Datong. They claimed to have come to the school to register on February 10th, which was not true, as Datong had not yet begun the work of registering students at that time. Their lawsuit was actually instigated by Xi Yuehan, the founder of Chengxin. This point can be investigated with the Education Bureau, and it will be clear. Datong has a total of 152 students. The court, after examining the numbers on the Datong's receipts for tuition fees, found that they did not match the number of students. He then questioned Shen Bingzhong, an employee of the school, about the reasons for the discrepancy. Subsequently, he interrogated Wang Xingsheng, who stated that he went to register on February 10th and paid the tuition fee to Shen Bingzhong, who gave him a receipt. Lu Yaoming gave him mimeographed lectures, which he placed together and have now been lost. Since registering and paying the fee, he only received three books sent by the school on September 25th and one more on October 9th, which he had previously submitted as evidence. He still has a remnant of the book wrapper. In these months, he had sent letters to the school fifteen or sixteen times, urging them about the correspondence courses, but received no reply. His younger brother, Xingnan, is only twenty years old and used to be an apprentice in a pawnshop, but never worked at the Chengxin School. Judge Xiang then instructed him, saying, "Now you are accusing someone of fraudulent acquisition of property, but you have not been able to produce evidence of paying tuition fees, nor do you have proof of enrollment. How will you prove that you are a student of the school? If you insist on accusing Lu of fraudulent acquisition of property, then Lu has also filed a countersuit against you for false accusation. If it is found that your accusation is false, then you must bear the responsibility for false accusation. Therefore, for the sake of settling the matter and pacifying the people, if you withdraw the private prosecution, then Lu's countersuit can also be dropped to avoid mutual litigation and increase ill will. At present, the facts of this case have been investigated and clarified. If you are unwilling to withdraw the private prosecution, then the debate must begin. You should think carefully about it." Upon hearing the instruction, Wang Xingsheng hesitated slightly and then said, "I originally did not want to get involved in litigation, but because Lu not only published a wanted notice for me but also brought many people to my home to cause me trouble, making me unable to sleep peacefully, I had no choice but to resort to litigation. Now, I can only request the court to investigate and handle the matter and order the two sides to begin the debate." Judge Xiang then ordered both parties to debate on the merits of the case, while the countersuit will be investigated separately. He then ordered that the case be reviewed again on the afternoon of January 15th and instructed Wang Xingsheng to notify Wang Xingnan to appear in court next time to await interrogation.</p>
<h3>Negotiations for the Ransom of the Three Crew Members Kidnapped from the Jiahe Break Down</h3>
<p>Bandits Demand 60,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Families Unable to Pay the Huge Sum</p>
<p>Ransom Representatives Have Left Hong Kong</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiahe vessel was robbed by pirates on November 4th of last year in Shanwei, and three people, namely, business director Shen Qinxiang, cargo clerk Li Xiaobin, and bookkeeper Ge Liangchen, were taken away. Two months have passed since then. After the bandits investigated the situation of the hostages, they specially summoned the families of the hostages to Hong Kong to negotiate the ransom. The bandits agreed to release the hostages immediately after paying for their food expenses. Unexpectedly, after the hostages' representatives arrived in Hong Kong, the bandits' attitude suddenly changed, demanding a huge sum of money, and the negotiations broke down. Yesterday afternoon, it was learned that the ransom matter could not proceed, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiating the Ransom The three kidnapped crew members were indeed poor and had no money. They originally had no ability to pay the ransom. Later, after receiving letters from each person from the bandit's lair, they stated that the bandits had sent people to investigate their family situations and knew that they were unable to pay a large sum of money. Now the bandit leader has agreed to release them leniently, only requiring each to pay a certain amount of food expenses before releasing the three. Therefore, each family followed the instructions in the letter and specially sent a representative to Hong Kong to contact the bandit's representative to negotiate the payment of the food expenses for the three people and conveniently lead the three back to Shanghai. On the family side, because of the difficult situation, it was also agreed that even if the food expenses were paid when the representative went to Hong Kong, the maximum amount should not exceed four or five hundred yuan per person.</p>
<p>Demanding a Huge Sum The representatives sent by the families of Shen and Li and others have been in Hong Kong for many days. It is reported that they have contacted the bandit's representative several times. The bandit's attitude is completely inconsistent with the opinions in the letters received by each family. The bandits demanded that the families of the three kidnapped hostages pay a huge ransom before agreeing to release them. Although the family representatives earnestly stated to the bandits that the three families had no property and relied on wages for their livelihoods. Since being kidnapped, the daily lives of each family have been pawned and begged for survival, and they really have no money to pay. They can only pay a small amount of food expenses. After the bandit representative reported to the bandit leader, the final negotiation was that the bandits demanded a ransom of at least 20,000 yuan per person, and the three had to pay 60,000 yuan before they could be released.</p>
<p>Representatives Return to Shanghai Initially, the families had planned to pay a maximum of five or six hundred yuan for food expenses for the three people, but no more than one thousand yuan. However, it was difficult for the three families to raise even this thousand yuan. They originally planned to wait for the representative to go to Hong Kong, and after the negotiations were settled, they would write back to Shanghai, and then find ways to raise the funds. Now, they have received a letter from Hong Kong stating that the bandits are demanding a huge sum of at least 60,000 yuan before they will agree to release them. Upon receiving this information, the three families believed that such a huge sum could not be afforded by the three families. Even one-tenth of it was actually difficult to do. Therefore, they resolutely ordered the people going to Hong Kong to quickly return to Shanghai, abandon the ransom negotiations, and simply let it go, because the three families would never be able to redeem them financially. The representatives going to Hong Kong have now left Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Lake Society Produces a Film on Formal Dress Movement</h3>
<p>Since the Lake Society launched the Formal Dress Movement, it has been able to make a very good impression on the community, thanks to the efforts of the person in charge, Mr. Shen Tianxin. It is reported that in order to widely promote and realize the movement, the society produced a film on the Formal Dress Movement on the 6th of this month at the Star Film Company. It started at 10:00 AM and was completed at 2:00 PM, with a total of seven acts. The famous director Cheng Bugao of the company served as the temporary director. On that day, the men's formal dress group included Chen Aishi, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Tianxin, Ling Songru, Shen Jiesheng, Shen Yanxiang, and members of the Silk Industry Association. The women's formal dress group included Mrs. Chen Yingshi, Mrs. Chen Aishi, Mrs. Pan Gongzhan, and the four daughters of Shen Tianxin, totaling hundreds of people. The film is divided into seven acts: (1) The chairman of the society delivers a speech, stating that formal dress is related to the national system and has been highly valued in the past dynasties. The Republic of China government has long clearly stipulated that the blue robe and black mandarin jacket are the formal dress for men, and the blue cheongsam is the formal dress for women. All formal dress materials must use domestic goods to avoid the outflow of rights and interests, etc. (2) The Ming Dynasty clothing is performed by Mr. and Mrs. Bao Xiaodie, executive members of the society, one with a gauze hat and red robe, and the other with a phoenix crown and xiapei, dressed solemnly and gracefully. Because Mr. Bao is a famous actor, the performance is particularly brilliant. (3) The clothing of the late Qing Dynasty is performed by Mr. and Mrs. Tang Jifu, executive members of the society, with an official hat and robe and a pearl crown and cloak, resembling the rituals of the deceased Qing Dynasty. The bows and retreats are even more lifelike. (4) Modern formal dress is performed by Mr. and Mrs. Chen Aishi, Mr. and Mrs. Pan Gongzhan, and the Shen Tianxin family, acting out a normal meeting ceremony. (5) The entire men's formal dress group performs, led by Chen Aishi and Shen Tianxin, progressing in order. (6) The entire women's formal dress group performs, led by Mrs. Chen Yingshi and Mr. and Mrs. Pan Xiang, proceeding in circles in turn. (7) The mixed performance of the men's and women's groups is divided into two rows, proceeding in turn.</p>

<h3>Police Officer Conniving with Bandits and Fleeing, Head of Xinzha Sub-Bureau Suspended</h3>
<p>Deputy Inspector General Temporarily Acting as Concurrent Head</p>
<p>Ruan Kaiki Took Office Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>According to the Kwok Man News Agency, Gong Yikui, the head of the Xinzha Sub-Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was suspended from his post because a police officer under his jurisdiction, Tian Liancheng, colluded with bandits Ma Hongxi and others on New Year's Day this year to commit armed robbery at No. 245 Tanzihwan, Zhabei. The case involved the theft of foreign currency and ornaments from the home of Xu Jintang, the police chief of the Linping Road Police Station in Zhabei, this city. In addition to sending the confession list of the arrested criminals to the Third Section of the General Bureau for handling, the sub-bureau also issued a wanted notice for the fugitive police officer Tian Xiancheng, but he has not yet been apprehended. However, Gong Yikui, considering that during this winter prevention period, not only did a robbery occur, but it also involved a police officer colluding with bandits and fleeing, a major case, specially prepared a document requesting to be punished for dereliction of duty. After receiving the report, Bureau Chief Wen Chaoji requested instructions from Mayor Wu and issued an order yesterday to suspend Gong Yikui, the head of the sub-bureau, from his post pending further instructions. The vacancy was temporarily filled by Ruan Kaiki, the deputy inspector general of the bureau's inspection office. It is reported that after receiving the order, Ruan went to the sub-bureau yesterday morning to take office.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River's Water Level Drops Sharply</h3>
<p>Liujiadu is the Shallowest</p>
<p>The water level of the Yangtze River has been receding very rapidly in recent days. The section of the Yangtze River between Wuhu and Jiujiang, specifically the Liujiadu section, has receded to only 4.66 meters of water depth, excluding the bottom level. Larger riverboats with deeper drafts can no longer load much cargo, and even smaller boats must wait for the tide to rise before they can pass through this section, causing riverboats to be delayed. If it recedes further, riverboats will have to reduce the amount of cargo they carry, otherwise, it will be difficult to pass through.</p>
<h3>Record of the Meeting of the United Relief Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Association convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in its conference room. Attendees included Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Gu Xinyi, Wang Binyan, Zheng Yuncen (representative of the Bao'an Nursing Home), Ni Rongtai (representative of the Warehouse Trade Public Welfare Association), Feng Yangshan (representative of the Chinese Jisheng Society), Huang Juntang (representative of the Weizhong Shantang), Wang Junsheng (representative of the Pushan Villa), Sun Yishan (representative of the Huhang Charity Association), Luo Xingyou (representative of the Zhabei Charity Group), Wang Zhongfu (representative of the Guangyi Shantang Chinese Women and Children Relief Association), Ye Shouhai (representative of the Xin Puyu Hall), Huang Xingjie (representative of the Shanghai Charity Group), Chen Wenkui (representative of the Shanghai Disabled Persons' Home), Fang Zhijun (representative of the Renji Shantang), Chen Kaifeng (representative of the Renji Infants' Home), and Qu Wenliu (representative of the Xinwei Relief Association). Chairman Wang Yiting first reported that the Zhabei Charity Group sets up a factory on Liuying Road in Zhabei every severe winter to provide congee. The Association has allocated 1,000 yuan from the funds for the Shelter from the Cold Project as a subsidy. It is estimated that the funds for the Shelter from the Cold Project this year will be far from sufficient, so no funds can be allocated yet. According to a letter from the Zhabei Charity Group, the congee factory has been operating since the 1st of this month, and the number of poor people eating congee is increasing daily, reaching 15,000 to 16,000 people, requiring more than 30 piculs of rice. There are still people who cannot get congee and are given copper coins instead. The space in the factory is not enough to accommodate everyone, and the funds are extremely depleted. It is now proposed to stop providing congee and instead give out rice coupons, 5 sheng for large households and 2 sheng for small households, which is estimated to require 1,000 piculs of rice. The congee factory has only raised about 200 piculs of rice, which is far from enough. It is hoped that each charitable organization will donate as much as they can to help the poor, which would be a great merit. Subsequently, the charitable organizations pledged the following amounts: Shanghai Charity Group 200 yuan, Renji Shantang 100 yuan, Chinese Jisheng Society 100 yuan, Ordinary Villa 100 yuan, Xinwei Relief Association 100 yuan, Lianyi Charity Association 100 yuan, Guangyi Shantang 100 yuan, Yimiao Board of Directors 100 yuan, Weizhong Shantang 100 yuan, Warehouse Trade Public Welfare Association 100 yuan. The meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Zhang Guanghua Accused of Killing His Younger Brother</h3>
<p>The Truth of the Chongdefang Blood Case Comes to Light</p>
<p>Zhang Suddenly Recanted His Confession in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>The Police Stated That the Defendant's Confessions Were All Written in His Own Hand</p>
<p>Zhang Guanghua, a 27-year-old man from Henan, and his younger brother, Zhang Guangzhou, an 18-year-old, lived together in the attic room on the third floor of No. 24 Chongdefang, MinGuo Road, outside the Xiaobeimen of the French Concession, in the home of Mrs. Dai Chen, a landlady from Ningbo. Guanghua originally worked at the Navigation Administration Bureau at No. 208, upstairs at the Enterprise Bank on Sichuan Road, but had recently been laid off. Guangzhou was still studying. On the morning of November 23rd of last year, a little after 4:00 AM, Guangzhou was suddenly stabbed in the neck and died. Guanghua also suffered five or six knife wounds to his head and jumped out of the window through the glass canopy, opening the window of the attic room on the second floor. Yan Jinyao, a fellow tenant, pried open the window and door and went downstairs.</p>
<p>(Shouting for help) The landlady's relative, Lin Shengxiang, went out to call the police, who reported to the French police. The police sent Guanghua to the hospital for treatment and transported Guangzhou's body to the coroner's office to request the Special No. 2 Court to send someone to investigate. Since there were no relatives in Shanghai, the body was buried by a charity organization. All of this was reported in the previous newspaper. Since the case was reported, the police have been conducting a thorough investigation but have made no progress. They waited for Zhang Guanghua to recover from his injuries and brought him back to the police station to begin the investigation, which revealed that the deceased was actually killed by Guanghua. According to rumors, the police investigation revealed that the cause of the case was that Guanghua lost his job and ordered his younger brother Guangzhou to return home, but Guangzhou refused, leading to an argument. That night, Guangzhou had the idea of killing his brother. While Guanghua was sleeping soundly,</p>
<p>(He Stabbed Him Viciously with a Knife) His brother's head. Guanghua woke up in his sleep and fought back, killing Guangzhou. The police investigation has concluded. Yesterday, witnesses Dai Chen (the landlady) and fellow tenants Yan Jintao, Shan Bingchang, Zhu Shengxiang, and neighbor Gu Chen were summoned to the court. Zhang Guanghua (whose head injuries had not fully healed and was wearing gauze and white cloth bandages) was brought to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Xiong Huiping and Clerk Tao Zongkan presided over the hearing. First, Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, presented the case and the detailed investigation process by the police, prosecuting him for murder. Zhang Guanghua (whose head injuries had not fully healed and was wearing gauze and white cloth bandages) testified that his younger brother Guangzhou had always</p>
<p>(Studied in Henan) I received a letter from my father saying that he could not afford to support my younger brother's studies, so I wrote to my brother asking him to come to Shanghai and I would teach him myself. He arrived in Shanghai on January 16th of last year. We, as brothers, had a very good relationship and lived in the same room, sleeping on two beds. Sometimes he was not diligent in his studies, and I would hit him on the head once or twice. He was very obedient to me. He usually did not go out unless I took him. My job was terminated on November 22nd, and I was eager to go home. That night, while I was sleeping, I felt someone stabbing me in the head with a knife, and then stabbing my brother. Because the lights were off at night, there was no one else in the room. I suddenly got up, but I couldn't open the door, so I</p>
<p>(Jumped Out of the Window) Knocked on the window of the attic room on the second floor and went in, then opened the door and went downstairs. The back door was open, so I shouted for help and went out, walking past two or three storefronts. A patrolman came and took me to the police station to report. I had five or six knife wounds on my head. [The judge] asked if your injuries were caused by your brother. I answered, I don't know. [The judge] asked, you admitted to killing your brother at the police station. I answered, no. At this point, the court ordered each witness to be summoned to testify, asking their age, place of origin, address, and occupation. After that, each was ordered to provide a written statement and dismissed. First, the landlady Dai Chen was questioned. I sleep with my son in the room behind the parlor. The defendants, the brothers, lived in the attic room on the third floor. Usually they</p>
<p>(Kept the Door Closed) They didn't often greet or call out. I don't know if their brotherly relationship was good or bad. I go out to sell fish every morning at 5:00 AM and return home at noon. I don't ask about their affairs. On the morning of the 23rd, I heard a loud noise on the canopy behind me in my sleep. I woke up, mistaking it for a fire alarm, and was so frightened that my adopted son went out to call the police. I don't know who the murder weapon that was presented was. Yan Jinyao testified: 41 years old, from Haiyan, living in the attic room on the second floor of Chongdefang. We each mind our own business and usually don't call out to each other. I usually don't go to the defendant's room, and I haven't heard them arguing. On the morning of the 23rd, I heard a very loud sound of lead peeling in my sleep, mistaking it for a thief falling down,</p>
<p>(Shouting for Help) And asking me to turn on the light. So I got up and turned on the light. The defendant jumped in through the window, his face covered in blood, standing on the platform. I helped him down. At that time, fellow tenants and neighbors all came to watch. The defendant came down from the platform and opened the door to his room and went downstairs. When the patrolmen and detectives came, I told them what I had seen. I don't know anything else. Shan Bingchang testified: 23 years old, from Shaoxing, recently came to Shanghai from my hometown. I don't know the defendant. On the day of the incident, my older brother Lin Shengxiang and I were sleeping on the mezzanine on the second floor. First, we heard a loud noise, then we heard cries for help. So I got up and went out to call the police. Patrolman No. 644 was called. When we entered the house together, the defendant came down the stairs. The patrolman then</p>
<p>(Took the Defendant Away) To the hospital. Later, a detective came. I accompanied him upstairs. The detective went into the attic room on the third floor and looked around, saying that someone had died and told us not to move or go in. Then I was left in the front room on the third floor. Lin Shengxiang testified: 21 years old, from Ningbo, living by selling fish, sleeping on the mezzanine on the second floor. My testimony is roughly the same as Shan Bingchang's. Gu Chen testified: 33 years old, from Ningbo, living at No. 22 Chongdefang. That day, I heard someone jumping down, making a noise. I suspected it was a thief and didn't dare to go forward to watch. I don't know anything else. According to the police</p>
<p>(Criminal Director) Henry translated that the defendant's confession at the police station was written by himself in his own hand. In the defendant's room, there were two beds, one facing east and one facing north. The deceased was lying between the two beds at the time. He bolted the door from the inside, so people outside could not get in. According to Chinese Patrolman Ding Zhenxiang, No. 644, at the time, the landlady came to call me, and I went in through the back door. I asked them what was going on. They said someone was shouting for help. So I called Yue Patrolman No. 466, and Nos. 382 and 192, and two Chinese patrolmen to guard the front and back doors. When the defendant came down the stairs, his head, face, and clothes were all covered in blood. I immediately took him to the</p>
<p>(Police Station to Report) Etc. According to detectives Qin Youyu and Zhang Ziying, and Patrolman Li Huachang, they reported the progress of the case. The defendant's father, Zhang Wenfu, received a letter in his hometown and rushed to Shanghai. He came to the court yesterday and pleaded twice, but was driven down by the bailiffs. Finally, the court ordered the defendant's father to be brought to the court and told him that his youngest son had been killed and that the police investigation showed that his eldest son had killed him and that he had been prosecuted. This court has accepted the case and will investigate and handle it according to law. If it is found that your eldest son is guilty, he will be punished. If he is found not guilty, he will be acquitted. Now you don't need to be anxious. Do you have any requests? The father Zhang respectfully withdrew. The court ordered the clerk to read aloud the written records of the testimonies of each person, and then ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the 18th of this month. The defendant was still detained and the court adjourned.</p>

Yesterday morning at about 11 o'clock, Mr. White, accompanied by Mr. Ratai, the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, visited the Chinese Red Cross Society on Jiujiang Road and then returned to his residence. In order to fulfill its duty as the host, the Society has scheduled a welcoming banquet at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road tomorrow (the 10th) at 7 p.m. and has invited Mr. Ratai, the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the Society, and more than ten executive directors to attend. After learning about this, Mr. Li Ting'an, Director of the Shanghai Health Bureau, also visited Mr. White at his hotel yesterday afternoon. It is said that Mr. White will visit Mayor Wu in the city center today and will return to Switzerland after a week's stay in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Photography Society Preparing Photo Exhibition</h3>
<p>For the purpose of promoting Chinese photographic art, photographers Shao Woyun, Hu Junlei, and others have organized the Shanghai Photography Society. Since its establishment, the Society's affairs have been very prosperous. This year marks the beginning of the Society's photo exhibition. Yesterday, a board meeting was held to prepare for the first exhibition, and a preparatory committee was elected to discuss the procedures. It is said that preparations will soon be completed, and the exhibition will be a grand occasion with a wide array of beautiful works.</p>
<h3>Fenzhou Liquor Industry Guild's Executive and Supervisory Board Meeting</h3>
<p>Yang Qiaosheng, the acting chairman of the Shanghai Fenzhou Liquor Industry Guild, resolutely resigned. After an enlarged meeting of the executive and supervisory boards on December 22nd of last year, it was unanimously decided to reinstate Xie Zhendong. Mr. Xie then proposed seven proposals for reorganization, all of which were passed on a case-by-case basis. The important points were to hold industry regulations and reduce membership fees, as well as to settle old debts of members and clear outstanding Chamber of Commerce dues. The following is the notice issued by the Guild on New Year's Day regarding the reorganization of Guild affairs, which roughly stated that the Guild's members were disunited, and its affairs had not developed, and the members were also lacking in unity. Now, in accordance with the resolutions of the enlarged meeting of the executive and supervisory boards, the first proposal is to send personnel to various districts to handle member registration, moderately reduce monthly fees, and settle old debts, so as to clear the Chamber of Commerce dues owed. Those who are well-respected will be elected as registrars to handle the registration door-to-door. This is a special notice, etc.</p>
<h3>Old America's Most Stylish Women's Shoe Store Grand Competition</h3>
<p>Old America's Most Stylish has always been a leading brand in women's shoes. Its original location was at the corner of Sanma Road and Guangxi Road. Last year, due to the expiration of the lease, it built a new, artistically designed store and moved to the opposite side of the small garden on Guangxi Road. This January marks the 15th anniversary of the store's opening. The store has specially made various stylish flannel warm shoes and is holding a grand competition for one month. During this period, customers will not only receive a 20% discount on all sizes but will also have a public lottery every night with excellent prizes. It is said that the method is that all invoices issued are numbered, and if the last digit of a customer's invoice number matches the drawn number (a total of ten numbers from 1 to 10), they will receive any product of the same value as the original invoice purchase, still be treated as a purchase, and then have another invoice issued to participate in another lottery, so that it is continuous. The excellence of the products, the novelty of the styles, the low prices, and the speed of ordering are secondary.</p>
<h3>Organization of the Destitute Children's Work-Study Group</h3>
<p>There are many poor children in Shanghai who are out of school and unemployed, lacking both the ability to make a living and the opportunity to study. This is not a blessing for society. Recently, several colleagues in the field of social education, in view of this, have specially organized a Destitute Children's Work-Study Group. During the day, they will teach commercial knowledge and carry goods for sale, using the surplus profits to maintain their lives. In the evening, they will provide two hours of classes, waiving tuition fees, so that both education and living can be solved, realizing the urgent needs of society. Those who are interested can obtain the articles of association and registration forms from the Construction Bookstore on Bai'er Road, west of Nanyang Bridge, in this city.</p>
<h3>New and Old Works by Chen Zhuzun</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Zhuzun, a professor at Jiaotong University, has written "Supplement to Mozi's Informal Talks," which is about six to seven hundred thousand words long. It collects about hundreds of books on Mozi from Sun Zhongrong onwards, in order to supplement Sun's book. Modern scholars such as Chen Shiyi and Tang Weizhi all believe that it is sufficient to compile a great compendium of Mohist studies. The book was previously submitted to the Commercial Press, and the typesetting and proofreading had been completed, but it had not yet been bound. During the January 28th Incident, it perished along with the national crisis. Scholars lamented it. Now, it is said that Mr. Chen has been engaged in restoring this book for three years, in addition to teaching, and has added new acquisitions in recent times. It is now almost complete and will be carefully proofread during the winter vacation and re-submitted to the Commercial Press for publication. After this book is completed, it is said that Mr. Chen intends to write a "Collected Annotations on Guanzi" in the style of Wang Xianqian's "Collected Annotations on Xunzi," as there is no good edition of the book "Guanzi." He has now collected a wealth of works on Guanzi.</p>
<p>The Deadline for Pre-ordering the Western-Style Four Series Essential Book is at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Four Series Essential Book printed by the Zhonghua Book Company in the Ju Zhen Imitation Song Edition has long been appreciated by the literary world. Last spring, the pre-sale of the five-open edition was oversubscribed. The fact that our country's ancient books can be widely circulated and popularized in all walks of life, and the deep love for our inherent culture, are all worthy of praise. Now, in response to the requests of various schools and libraries, the Company has re-printed the Western-style Four Series Essential Book, using a four-leaf-in-one page photocopy of the original printed five-open edition, printed on "Ci Dao Lin" paper, and rubber-stamped with security marks. The entire book contains 351 titles, totaling more than 11,300 volumes. The pre-order price is only two and a half cents per volume, which is unprecedentedly low. Moreover, for schools with insufficient funds and aspiring scholars, a payment plan in installments has been specially formulated. By saving more than ten yuan a month, one can purchase a copy in two or three years. If it is used as a commemorative gift or purchased by families to pass on to their children, the meaning is even more profound. Therefore, there are many orders from various places. The price is now set low, and the collection is easy, and the font size is moderate. There are three types of binding: A, B, and C. The original price of the A-type cloth-covered gold-lettered edition is 720 yuan, but the pre-order price is only 360 yuan. The B-type cloth-covered printed-lettered edition is 640 yuan, and the pre-order price is 320 yuan. The C-type paper-covered and bound edition is 560 yuan, and the pre-order price is 280 yuan. The deadline is the end of this month. Those who wish to pre-order, please do so as soon as possible. Sample copies of the book can be obtained from the Company.</p>
<h3>Li Yingbiao's Book (Coke) Published</h3>
<p>Dr. Li Yingbiao, an expert in steel engineering who studied in Belgium and is currently the Chief of General Affairs of the Nanjing Municipal Health Office, has recently published a book titled (Coke), which contains his years of learning and experience. The content is divided into: (1) The Origin of Coke Production, (2) The Production of Coke, (3) A Brief Diagram of the Extraction of By-products and Utilization of Residual Heat from Coke Production, (4) The Xuanmei Solvay Oven, (5) Coke Ovens for Extracting By-products and Utilizing Waste Steam, (6) A General Discussion of Ordinary Coke Ovens, (7) The Theory of Compression. The text is more than 10,000 words long, with outstanding insights and detailed elaboration. The cover is inscribed by Wang Jingqi, former Chinese Envoy to Belgium, and it is printed by the Jinling Printing House in Huangnigang, Nanjing. The price is fixed at five dimes per copy. The general agent in this city is the Dagong Bao Agency Department at No. 322 Jiujiang Road. The following is an excerpt from its introduction: In the past hundred years, our country has been in hardship and distress, forced into economic oppression by the great powers, with backward industries and extreme poverty. However, in terms of national defense construction, even the most skilled woman would find it difficult to cope. Even military supplies rely on the agricultural sector facing an empty granary. Therefore, the key to addressing the root cause of poverty and weakness is to seek ways to become rich and strong. Mr. Wu Zhihui once encouraged our people with the eight characters (Everyone is responsible for industrial planning), as the common goal to pursue in the future. I deeply admire his incisive words. However, the implementation of industrial planning requires steel everywhere, and steel is made from cast iron. The smelting of cast iron cannot be accomplished without the supply of a large amount of coke. Therefore, the production of coke is one of the most important things in revitalizing industry, which is clearly evident. With our country's rich resources, considering the current market value of coke, setting up factories to manufacture it is already profitable just from pure charcoal. Moreover, there are by-products such as ammonia, which can be used to make fertilizers for farmland; black oil, which is necessary for building roads; and gas, which can be used for fuel engines, enough to plug the loopholes and recover rights and interests, which would be of great benefit to people's livelihood and the national economy. Now, I will extract the experience I have gained and describe in detail the construction of coke ovens, the production of coke, the extraction of by-products, and the selection of coke ovens, as well as the factory construction plan, etc., and add a general discussion. This is a rough draft, and there will be many errors. If you can point them out, I would be very grateful.</p>

<p>(City Voices) ▲ Domestic Calcium Carbonate Sells Well Calcium carbonate is an important raw material in rubber products, and it used to be imported from Japan, which had a significant impact on the rubber industry. In recent years, domestic calcium carbonate has been temporarily promoted. Chen Xiaoping, the manager of the Xinyue Chemical Factory in this city, has been enthusiastically researching and manufacturing calcium carbonate, which is of high purity and lower price than Japanese products, so it is very popular among factories. Although Japanese products are being sold at low prices, the factory is also enduring sacrifices, which has greatly hit the sales of Japanese products, adding a lot of glory to the domestic products industry. Recently, due to the cold and rainy weather, it has been difficult to ship the goods, so the factory has specially built a drying room to replace sun drying. Although the cost has increased, the selling price is still cheaper than Japanese products, it is said.</p>
<p>(Publishing World) ▲ Detailed Explanation of Trigonometry is About to be Published The book "Trigonometry" by Mr. Seuses III of the United States is valued for its precise content, and many bookstores have translated the original book into Chinese for use as a textbook, such as "Trigonometry" by Zhonghua, "Saisiusi" by Nanjing, and "Plane Geometry" by Beiping Culture. Now, Zhang Zhaoyun, a mathematics teacher at Jingye Middle School, in order to facilitate teachers' reference and students' self-study, has made a detailed explanation of all 1,500 questions in the exercises. The content and organization are generally calculated by section, so that each book can be used universally. The solution methods strive for novelty and clarity, with more than 1,000 illustrations. It is currently being bound and is scheduled to be released in early January. Sample copies are available for request from the Xueyi Society of Shanghai Jingye Middle School (Pai'ai).</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor, Since the beginning of winter, it is common to see reports in newspapers of people dying from coal poisoning due to using coal briquettes to heat their homes. The reports are incessant. It has been found that coal poisoning can cause people to faint and lose their breath, which is a state of suspended animation, not true death. If sauerkraut soup or sauerkraut is used to resuscitate the person who has lost their breath, no matter how deep the poisoning, they can be awakened immediately. This is a method that has been used in Beijing for hundreds of years and is extremely effective. Because there are such unfortunate events happening in this city every day, and no one is being saved, I really cannot remain silent. I am specially writing to your newspaper to promote this widely and create happiness for the people. If there is no sauerkraut soup, salty vegetable brine can also be used for resuscitation, which can also be effective, but not as effective as sauerkraut soup. This is to the esteemed Editor of the Shen Bao, Qu Mei kowtows, January 6th.</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor, Regarding the news item (Collection of Fisheries Construction Fee Fails; Dai Yongdian Accused of Ignoring Funds) published in the news column of your newspaper on the 6th of this month, I was shocked to read it. The case of Jin Gengyao suing Yong Tang is because Yong Tang and Jin are both shareholders of the Hangzhou Wanchun Fish Firm. This lawsuit is entirely a dispute between partners in a joint venture. Yong Tang is currently in the midst of a criminal counterclaim. It is purely a private matter and has nothing to do with the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office. However, the words in your newspaper's report that involve the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office are prone to misleading people. It is thought that the information was inaccurate. Therefore, I am specially writing to request that you make a factual correction to avoid misrepresentation. This is my earnest plea. With best regards, Dai Yongtang respectfully, January 8th, 24th year.</p>

<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Hearing Words, She Covers Her Tears and Sells Herself to Endure Bitterness; Carefully Observing, She Seeks to Join the East and Earnestly Hopes for Kindness</p>
<p>Cheng Zhi looked at Sister Hu and said, "Just look at her state, she certainly won't mind this matter, so there's no need to worry about that. It's just that when he and Xiao Ji wanted that money, Xiao Ji denied it with a blank face, saying it was just a joke. They're not..." He paused, and then said, "I can't bear to say these words. But I thought this girl was here to get married, and whether it succeeds or not is a matter for the two families, so why should the matchmaker pay out of their own pocket? If they want a dollar for every trip, that's easy, the teahouse servants can think of other ways with him. But Xiao Ji can't speak as tactfully as I do. This girl is the same age as us, and instead of getting money, she's subjected to such an insult. Isn't that pitiful? To be honest, what kind of marriage is this? It's just selling her body to get a bowl of rice for three generations. When a person has nothing else to sell, and they have to sell their own body, that's always a heartbreaking thing. If there's good news, it means her body has found a buyer..." Suddenly, there were several very low sobs nearby. It turned out that Miss Yueying, overcome with sadness, was shedding tears like a pouring rain. She didn't dare to use the clothes she was wearing to wipe her tears, because those clothes were borrowed. She had to pull out the sleeve of the clothes she was wearing underneath to wipe away the tears. Cheng Zhi was also speaking with great enthusiasm, and he had forgotten whether the girl sitting in front of him could bear what he was saying. Now that Yueying was crying, he realized that he had spoken too freely, so he immediately cleared his throat and smiled, "That was my mistake, Miss, please don't take it to heart. Otherwise, when Sister Hu and Xiao Ji were arguing, I wouldn't have let you into the room." (107)</p>
<h3>Yuan Xiaoyou's Extreme Advocacy for Concubinage</h3>
<p>— Wang Yun</p>
<p>Those who take concubines must be crying out, "Injustice! It's unjust!" Concubines have no legal status. The head of the family spends a lot of money on the bride price and pays alimony, but still cannot claim her as his own. Recently, the Supreme Court's Unified Law Interpretation Committee interpreted that if a concubine commits adultery, the head of the family has no right to sue. Then all the heads of families who take concubines should all cry out in unison, "Injustice! It's unjust!" As the old saying goes, "(Stolen gongs and drums cannot be played loudly)." Clearly, it's your own concubine, but she becomes like stolen gongs and drums, and even if she has an affair with someone else, you can't speak out. Doesn't this mean willingly wearing a green hat? But don't worry, heads of families who take concubines. I will record the memorial submitted by Yuan Xiaoyou, who praised concubinage during the Tuoba Wei Dynasty in the Northern History, giving the general idea. I think that when the heads of families who take concubines see it, they will definitely laugh through their tears.</p>
<p>(In ancient times, the feudal lords married nine women, and the scholars had one wife and one concubine. The Jin decree stated that the princes could marry eight concubines, and the marquises could marry six concubines. The official decree stated that the first and second ranks had four concubines, the third and fourth ranks had three concubines, the fifth and sixth ranks had two concubines, and the seventh and eighth ranks had one concubine. Therefore, yin teachings were cultivated, and the succession was extensive. Extensive succession is filial piety. Cultivating yin teachings is propriety. [Omission] Nowadays, people generally have no standards! When parents marry off their daughters, they teach them jealousy. Aunts and sisters greet each other and advise each other to be jealous, in order to control the husband as a woman's virtue, and to be able to be jealous as a woman's skill. If the husband's heart of jealousy arises, then the propriety between wife and concubine will be abandoned, and the signs of adultery will increase. This is what I hate and regret. I request that the princes and dukes be the first rank, marrying eight concubines, so as to prepare for the affairs of the nine women. The second rank should prepare seven, the third and fourth ranks should prepare five, and the fifth and sixth ranks should have two wives and two concubines... Princes, marquises, generals, ministers, meritorious officials, descendants of sons and daughters, should fill the court, and the succession should be endless. This is my ambition.) If Yuan Xiaoyou's proposal were passed in today's Legislative Yuan, those who have taken concubines could all rejoice and shout several times "(Long live concubinage)!" Unfortunately, this is just a historical article!</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xia Cenjuan)</p>
<p>Before the three brothers married, they loved each other like hands and feet. But after each of them got married and started a family, they often quarreled and scolded each other all day long. The reason for this is that they all listened to what their wives said in bed. As a result, they divided the family property and went to court, and loving brothers became enemies. Liu Xuande in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms said, "A wife is like clothes, and brothers are like hands and feet. Clothes can be mended if they are torn, but hands and feet cannot be reattached if they are broken." This statement is not very accurate. You must know that in modern times, brothers are seen as cheap assets, while wives are seen as precious boats!</p>
<h3>In the Waiting Room</h3>
<p>— Wu Liao'an</p>
<p>The market is extremely bleak and depressed, but the waiting room in the court is strangely bustling!</p>
<p>Ding-ling! Ding-ling! As soon as the bell for office hours rang, the waiting room was already crowded with men, women, old people, and young people, all waiting to be judged by the law.</p>
<p>On the face of each of these people, there was a kind of worried, fearful, and silent expression, each different, as well as the ferocious faces and arrogant attitudes of the creditors. If we were to capture all of this in a camera, what a profound expression of the faces it would be!</p>
<p>A Western-dressed man, covered in filth, with a snow-white hard collar that had almost turned black. His hair was long like an artist's, and his face was haggard and pale, with no smile at all. He sat silently in the left corner of the waiting room. On the seat opposite him, a frivolous and fashionable modern woman often showed a self-satisfied state to him and sometimes even sneered at him. It turned out that the two of them were the main characters in a divorce case! Some of the people waiting were gossiping, taking them as conversation material, whispering and guessing.</p>
<p>XXX, XXX, when the names of the parties were shouted loudly by a stern-looking bailiff to begin the hearing, it immediately broke through the clamor in the waiting room, and it became so quiet that even the sound of breathing could be heard. The blood of each of the waiting defendants would suddenly become tense, fearing to hear their own name. But how could that be possible? Finally, they were summoned to be tried one by one!</p>
<p>Ding-ling! Ding-ling! The bell for the end of office hours was ringing! The sound of people in the waiting room changed from bustling to silent, as silent as the depressed market.</p>
<h3>The Security of Imperialism</h3>
<h3>Remembering the Qiusheng Building</h3>
<p>— Zhengdong</p>
<p>Everyone knows Ouyang Xiu's "Ode to the Sound of Autumn"; this summer, while traveling in Yu, I unintentionally discovered the Qiusheng Building, so I recorded it as follows.</p>
<p>The Qiusheng Building is located in Huaxian, northern Yu, about eighteen li from Daokou. There is a county road that can be accessed, so transportation is still considered convenient. Enter the south gate and travel a few hundred paces to reach the Ouyang Academy; it is now the County First Primary School. There is an ancient stele in front of the gate, engraved with the words "The Place Where Ouyang Wenzhong Gong of the Song Dynasty Studied," which was written by the local county magistrate. Inside, there is a room; on the wall is embedded a blue stone, engraved with the full text of "Ode to the Sound of Autumn." Further in is the Qiusheng Building; the plaque in front of the building is still new. When asked, it was said that it was recently re-inscribed because the previous one was destroyed in the rebellion of 1927. The building has a stone base, so it is quite sturdy. Facing south, there are three wooden windows. Inside, the room is very empty, the stairs have been destroyed, and above is the library; according to legend, there were more than two thousand books before, but they were all destroyed in the war of 1927. To this day, not a single scrap remains. The roof is rectangular in shape and not very wide. It is currently the principal's office, but during the summer vacation, all items have been moved out. Outside, the roof is covered with weeds, the scene is desolate. Behind it are several houses, all used as classrooms. The courtyard has been occupied by soldiers for a long time, and everything has been destroyed. Although it has been repaired, the doors and windows are still messy and uneven, and there is nothing worth recording. Therefore, I will omit it.</p>
<p>In the southwest of the courtyard, there is an ancient temple from the Sui Dynasty, which was later destroyed in the White Lotus Rebellion of the Qing Dynasty; now, only an ancient pagoda remains, its top bald, and the pagoda body is tilted and about to collapse. The authorities ignore the historical sites, causing the buildings of previous generations to be destroyed day by day. It is truly lamentable!</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— Translated from the original by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>But don't underestimate this simple palace! It really occupies a very important position in the history of the Manchus! The Empress Dowager also regarded it as an antique with great commemorative value. As soon as we walked in, she immediately pointed east and west, explaining all the arrangements and decorations to us piece by piece, and she spoke very fluently and thoughtfully, as if she had been here several times before; in fact, she was visiting for the first time, just like us! It is a pity that there was no one who was truly familiar with the history of our clan at this time, because if there were, it would not be difficult to immediately judge the truth of the Empress Dowager's words. However, although I cannot guarantee whether the story about the hunting ground is true, her knowledge is indeed frighteningly broad at times, and many of them are true facts, which cannot be denied! She often prides herself on her extensive knowledge and strong memory. Whenever she has something more unusual to tell us, she often speaks with extraordinary eloquence, for fear of failing to move us. This attitude is actually a manifestation of a woman's vanity, but she herself doesn't realize it!</p>
<p>Inside this palace, large story paintings are painted on every wall with various colors of oil paint. Although their colors have become very dull due to the passage of time, and the brushwork of the paintings is also very crude, the outlines can still be considered clear, and the postures and expressions of the people in the paintings can still express seventy or eighty percent of their original intent. These murals are in all three rooms. The Empress Dowager led us along, explaining these paintings to us, which turned out to be all hunting portraits of past Manchu leaders. (217)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous talk</p>
<h3>Mr. Wu Zhihui's Clean Argument</h3>
<p>— Ye Xianyun</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui, a supervisory committee member, gave a speech at our Zhenjiang Provincial Medical and Political College the other day. His remarks about the Japanese were quite interesting, and I will describe them as follows: "We are suffering a great loss from the Japanese now. But they do have several advantages; for example, they love to use domestic products. But this is not their primary advantage. Their greatest advantage lies in the word 'cleanliness'. The meaning of the word 'cleanliness' includes cleanliness and neatness. They are clean at all times and in all places. The cleanliness of houses goes without saying, and even the villages are very clean. I can use a joke to describe it: take their latrines as an example; the wooden boards on the pit in their latrines are so clean that you can actually squat down and play Go on them. Their walls are made of mud, and some are still in the style of our ancient China, which is very economical, and the layout is also very neat and clear. For example, when building a Western-style house, everything conforms to the Western style, but even the smallest nail is entirely their own domestic product, so Japan is an unusual nation. Their houses have mud walls below and wooden boards above, which is very much in line with the principle of simplicity and economy. For example, if you go to see them, take off your shoes and enter, it is the living room. After a while, you eat a meal, and you eat here. When it gets dark, you turn over the cabinet next to you and you can sleep. Although this is only one room, it has several uses for people, and it is so clean inside that there is nothing messy, because they get rid of everything that is useless. Japanese servants on ships throw wine bottles, cookie tins, and other miscellaneous items straight into the sea. But our Cantonese servants hide everything. So the Japanese are really poor, which corresponds to our old saying, 'a house with bare walls'. On the other hand, in our country's villages, people are always reluctant to throw away broken stools with three legs. For example, some shops on the streets of Shanghai, such as ham shops, still hang up the leftover leg and foot, and the old worn mat of the wasp's nest, or place them there securely.</p>
<p>On the one hand, they throw away a lot of junk, but on the other hand, their manufacturing capabilities are also surprisingly successful, and new and good things are often produced, and their competitiveness is also very fierce. For example, to buy a sheet on the British cotton market costs seven and a half shillings, but to get it from Japan only costs two and a half shillings. Everyone knows that German goods are the most exquisite items in the world. Japan desperately imitates them, and the quality is not far off, but the price is several times cheaper. The water conservancy in the Netherlands is very developed, so they need a lot of water pipes. Originally, they bought them from Belgium. From Belgium to the Netherlands is about the same as from Zhenjiang to Nanjing, which is very close. But Japan shipped them from a very long distance, and the price was cheaper, so the Netherlands adopted Japanese water pipes. Think about it, isn't it scary? Isn't it fierce? Furthermore, Shanghai foreigners like to hire Japanese or Belgian maids. People generally think that foreign women are very extravagant, but this is a big mistake. I have lived in Belgium. Middle-class families there do not have the custom of hiring servants. The landlady of the house where I lived, her husband was an engineer in an electrical factory and earned eight pounds a week, but she did everything herself. She even shined our leather shoes for us. She got up early in the morning, did other people's things first, and then did her own hair, cooked, read the newspaper, and summarized current events for us to listen to. After we finished eating and went out, she cleaned our room, cleaned the carpet, wiped the oilcloth, and wiped the doorway. She also had to wipe the streets in front of the door. They first washed them thoroughly with a lot of water, then scrubbed them with a brush, and finally wiped them with a towel, but the towel that had been wiped was not very dirty. British women are also diligent, but they are not as good as Belgian women. Therefore, if our country wants to survive, it must follow the example of the Japanese and stand on cleanliness."</p>

<h3>Forty-One Countries Sign Up for Next Year's Berlin World Games</h3>
<p>Hitler Appointed Honorary President</p>
<p>Tickets for the Games Have Already Gone on Sale</p>
<p>(Berlin Correspondence) The 11th World Olympic Games will be held in Berlin starting on August 1st next year. The German side is sparing no effort in its preparations. German leader Hitler has agreed to serve as the honorary president of the Games. Tickets for next year's Games went on sale in Berlin on January 1st of this year. Switzerland has also decided on the number of athletes it will send. Interest in the upcoming Games is very high.</p>
<p>▲Hitler Appointed Honorary President</p>
<p>Due to the past practices of previous Games, and in order to respect the Olympic Games, which is an important means of promoting peace and cooperation among nations, the head of state of the host country is always the honorary president of that Games. At the 1908 Games in London, King Edward VII of England was the honorary president of the Games. At the 1912 Games in Stockholm, King Gustav V of Sweden was the honorary president. At the 1920 Games in Antwerp, King Albert of Belgium was the honorary president. At the 1924 Games in Paris, French President Doumergue was the honorary president. At the 1928 Games in Los Angeles, US President Hoover was the honorary president. In the spring of 1933, the late German President Hindenburg also accepted the honorary presidency of the 1936 Games, but unfortunately, he passed away due to illness. Now, leader Hitler, due to President Hindenburg, has accepted the position of inheritance, and has sent a letter to the chairman of the organizing committee, Dr. Li Huade, expressing his enthusiasm for care.</p>
<p>▲Welcome to All Countries to Participate in Football</p>
<p>On November 17, 1934, the Executive Committee of the International Football Association resolved to authorize the football associations of its affiliated countries to participate in the Berlin Football Championship. This resolution has confirmed that football will be one of the championship events of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. The German Football Association was very pleased to hear this, and Chairman Li Mann sent a letter to the football associations of all countries affiliated with the International Football Association, asking them to accept this resolution and accept the invitation of the German Olympic Committee. In order to enhance the relationship between the football associations of various countries and fulfill the friendship of the host, the German Football Association stated that it would lead 15,000 German football associations to welcome the football teams of various countries to Germany to participate.</p>
<p>▲Torch Relay Enthusiastically Participating</p>
<p>The Olympic committees of Greece, Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary have all agreed to participate in the Olympic torch relay run before the opening of the 1936 Berlin Games. The route and allocation of athletes will be decided or changed at the national conferences in March.</p>
<p>▲Tickets for the Games Have Already Gone on Sale</p>
<p>After the newspapers announced in November that tickets for the Games would go on sale in advance starting on January 1, 1935, the number of reservations reached more than one hundred within a week. The value of cash and checks amounted to more than a thousand pounds. To this day, the numbers are even more impressive. However, these pre-sold tickets are only limited to competitions held in the large stadium, such as the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games, track and field events, football and outdoor handball semi-finals and finals, and other performances. Swimming, boxing, fencing, and rowing competitions held outside the stadium are not pre-sold. Season tickets for each sport of the Games will not be available until July 1, 1935. Tickets for the large stadium are divided into three classes: Class A is 100 marks, Class B is 60 marks, and Class C is 40 marks. Group discounts are also available.</p>
<p>▲Two More Countries Accept Invitations Recently, two more countries, the Irish Free State and Monaco, have approached the Games and accepted invitations to participate. At present, a total of 41 countries have signed up to participate. The only country that declined to participate was Judea. According to the reply from Gil Kisch, chairman of the Judean Olympic Committee, the Judean Olympic Committee was established not long ago and is still in its infancy and training period, so it is very difficult to participate in 1936. He hopes to see everyone in the future.</p>
<p>▲Sweden Sends 2,000 People for Calisthenics</p>
<p>As a result of recent discussions between the Swedish Gymnastics Association and the German Organizing Committee, it was decided that two teams of men and women would be sent to Berlin to perform Swedish-style freehand exercises and calisthenics. If accommodation is not a problem, each team will have 1,000 people. The performance will be around the afternoon of August 8, 1936. The number of athletes sent by one country to the Olympic Games will be a new era. This great plan can only be admired.</p>
<p>▲Number of Swiss and Finnish Athletes</p>
<p>The number of athletes that Switzerland and Finland will send in the future has been determined as follows:</p>
<p>▲Switzerland</p>
<p>Shooting 25 people, cycling 14 people, wrestling 7 people, swimming 12 people, gymnastics 15 people, ice skating 6 people, hockey 15 people, fencing 12 people, freestyle cycling 12 people, rowing 12 people, boxing 8 people, ice hockey 12 people, track and field 21 people, weightlifting 15 people, rowing 26 people, basketball 7 people, plus equestrian and coaches 69 people, representatives 9 people, totaling 219 people.</p>

<p>▲Latvia</p>
<p>Latvia has decided to participate in various winter competitions, track and field, wrestling, boxing, weightlifting, shooting, freestyle cycling, and basketball. All aspects of the work are actively being prepared.</p>

<h3>Jiangwan Lost to West Youth in West Youth Basketball Last Night</h3>
<p>30 to 46</p>
<p>West Youth Basketball defeated Jiangwan last night with a score of 46 to 30. The first ten minutes of the first half were very tense. First, Chen Zongqi of Jiangwan suddenly emerged as a dark horse, opening the scoring. Zhou Dayun and Chen Xuechong followed, immediately taking a 6-0 lead, and their momentum was at its peak. However, Carlsen and Smith did not give in and tied the score at 6-6. Then there was another tie at 10-10. After that, West Youth gradually took the lead, with West Youth leading 22-14 at halftime. In the second half, Jiangwan scored two consecutive goals, as if there was a turning point, but unexpectedly, they fell into a slump from then on. West Youth scored ten consecutive points, and Jiangwan's vitality was greatly damaged. They were unable to resist and lost 46-30.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Both Mr. Jiang and Mr. Liu, Representatives Attending the East Asia Higher Education Conference, Have Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Mr. Jiang Menglin Went to Beijing Last Night to Report to the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>▲Deeply Moved by Visiting Many Rural Areas in the Philippines</p>
<p>▲Filipinos Have No Problem with Livelihood and Education is Also Universal</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Menglin and Mr. Liu Zhanen, representatives of our country to the East Asia Higher Education Conference in the Philippines, returned to Shanghai at 2:00 pm the day before yesterday on the Jesson. (The rumor that Mr. Liu was delayed in returning is not true.) Mr. Jiang took the night train to Beijing last night to report on the situation to the Ministry of Education and will return to Pingjin immediately. Our Shanghai reporter met with Mr. Jiang at the New Asia Hotel yesterday and discussed the experience in the Philippines in detail. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Conference Experience Mr. Jiang First Talked About This Conference Was Proactively Convened by the Philippines, Purely for the Exchange of Opinions and Communication of Feelings, and Was Held for Three Days From the 19th to the 21st of Last Month. Japanese Representatives Also Participated. What Was Discussed at the Meeting Was Purely What Was Proposed by the Philippines, and Opinions Were Exchanged With Each Other, and There Was No Motion. I (Jiang Claimed) Gave a Speech at the Meeting (Chinese Higher Education), and Mr. Liu Zhanen Gave a Speech (Chinese Education Trends). After the Meeting, I Went to Nearby Villages and Educational Conditions, and Left the Philippines by Ship Until the 4th of This Month.</p>
<p>▲Filipino Life Xu Jiang Talked About the Tour and Said That He Was Quite Moved by the Situation of the Rural Areas in the Philippines. The First Point Was That the Filipinos Were Blessed by Nature, and the People's Livelihood Was Not a Problem. The Products Were Rich, and Food and Fruits Were Everywhere. With a Little Effort, They Could Be Fed and Dressed. Living Is Also Simple. There Are No Beggars and Few Thieves. In This Superior Environment, Filipinos Hardly Believe That There Is a Hunger Problem in the World. China Is Difficult to Achieve Even With Large-Scale Engineering for Production. In the Philippines, I Asked Whether There Were Bandits in the Philippines, and the Filipinos Cried Ceaselessly. From This, You Can See the General Situation.</p>
<p>▲Unified Belief Second, Filipinos' Belief in Religion Is Almost Completely Unified. More Than 90% of People Completely Believe in Christianity. Therefore, What the Spaniards Have Given to Filipinos in the 400 Years Since They Arrived in the Philippines Is the Church. There Is a Church in Every Square Mile of the Village, and People's Houses Also Imitate the Church Format. The Unity of Their Belief Is Really Rare, Unlike China, Where People Worship Heaven and Earth, Believe in Buddha and Tao, and Religious Beliefs Are Absolutely Inconsistent.</p>
<p>▲Universal Education Third, Education in the Philippines Has Almost Become Universal. More Than Two-Thirds of the People Enter Schools. Therefore, What the Americans Have Given to Filipinos in the 35 Years Since They Ruled the Philippines Is the School. There Must Be a School in Every Village. The Equipment and Architectural Style of the Schools Follow Government Regulations and Are Completely Uniform. When the Americans First Went to the Philippines, They Brought 1,000 Elementary School Teachers From the United States. Now, Most of the Teachers in the Schools Are Filipinos. They Regard Universal Education as the Most Important Work.</p>
<p>▲Education Costs The Reason Why Education Is Universal in the Philippines Is That the Americans First Sorted Out Finances. The Central Government Recharges 40% for Education Expenses, the Province Recharges 40% to 60% for Education Expenses, and the Local Government (Called City) Recharges One-Third of the Total Education Expenses of the Central Government and the Province. Therefore, Education in the Philippines Is Divided Into Central Education, Provincial Education, and Municipal Education. Its Funding Is Sufficient, Which Is Unmatched by China. Secondly, the Philippines Attaches Great Importance to Rural Education. The Average Living Expenses of Rural Teachers in China Are Only 9 Yuan Per Person, Which Is Higher in Cities. In the Philippines, Talents Are Completely Distributed, Regardless of Rural or Urban Standards. Sometimes the Living Expenses of Rural Teachers Are Higher Than Those of Urban Teachers. This Is Their Characteristic, and Teachers Are Transferred to Each Other, Not Appointed by Local Teachers, So That the Language Can Be Gradually Unified, Which Can Reduce Regional Concepts. The Language Used Is Completely English, and Local Languages Are Gradually Decreasing.</p>
<p>▲Overseas Chinese Life There Are About 100,000 Overseas Chinese in the Philippines, Most of Whom Are Engaged in Small Commercial Businesses Such as Rice Mills, Soap, Groceries, etc. 80% of Them Are Controlled by Chinese People, but All the Living Habits of These Chinese People Have Been Assimilated. China Has Entered the Philippine Islands Since the Zhengde and Wanli Periods of the Ming Dynasty, but It Has Not Brought Other Cultures Except for Food. Moreover, the Philippines Is Not a Weak Nation and Is Quite Organized. Restrictions on Chinese Immigration, So There Are Not As Many Chinese in the Philippines As There Are in Taiwan and Other Southeast Asian Islands. In Short, the Philippines Is the Most Energetic Nation in the Ocean, and the Future Cannot Be Limited.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Higher Education in Our Country with Major Countries in the World</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Made the First Statistics on the Comparison of Higher Education in Our Country in 1931 with Various Countries in the World, and Published It in This Newspaper. Now, the Ministry of Education Will Make the Second Statistics on the Comparison of Higher Education in the Country in 1931 with Major Countries in the World and Record It Below:</p>

<p>(Note) The United States has the largest number of higher education institutions and the largest number of enrolled students, ranking first. There are 73 people per 10,000 people who receive higher education. In our country, only one person per 10,000 people receives higher education. In recent years, the Ministry of Education has been rectifying private universities to demonstrate faith and promote progress, and has補助办法有 seventy-two million yuan) to help them develop. It seems that it has learned from the fact that higher education in our country is not as good as others, and is thinking of promoting it.</p>
<h3>Points for Improving Vocational Education in Beiping City</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously dispatched Inspector Zhong Daozan to inspect the state of vocational education in Beiping City. The results of the inspection have been reported to the Ministry. The following is an excerpt from the report regarding the points for improvement in Beiping City's vocational education:</p>
<p>(1) There are 19 private vocational supplementary schools in the city for sewing, embroidery, knitting, typing, bookkeeping, etc., and 13 learning institutions for music, art, and hygiene. The number is not small. However, most of them have simple facilities and ineffective teaching methods. Some even have only a school sign without students or classrooms. Others have school sites that frequently move without a fixed location. Moreover, the instability of students, the lack of administrative organization, the mixing of school buildings with residential houses, and the non-compliance of course times are common problems. Strict assessment should be carried out, and subsidies and guidance should be given to those with better performance and relatively applicable facilities to improve them. Those that are poorly managed and hopeless should be ordered to suspend operations or have their registration revoked.</p>
<p>(2) The Municipal Senior Industrial Vocational School has achieved good results and the students' training is also good. However, the following three points should be noted: (1) The school buildings are small and the facilities are not perfect. The bureau should allocate funds to enrich the content for development. (2) Excluding drafting, the practical training hours are only 9 hours per week for lower grades and 16 hours per week for higher grades, which does not meet the regulations. Efforts should be made to increase them immediately to emphasize skills. (3) The annual product output is not large. It is impossible to assess costs with accounting. Improvements should be made quickly.</p>
<p>(3) The layout of the school buildings and the administrative organization of the Municipal Senior Commercial Vocational School are generally satisfactory. However, the following four points should be noted: (1) Teaching focuses on lectures. Besides typing and bookkeeping, there are few other practical exercises. Little attention is paid to commercial intelligence, economic surveys, and commodity research. (2) Commercial advertising and design are ordinary. A commodity exhibition room has not been established. (3) Experienced people should be hired for practical commercial courses. Because student employment is difficult, liaison with the business community should be made to seek service opportunities. (4) Commercial supplementary classes should not be limited to senior levels. More general commercial supplementary classes should be set up.</p>
<p>(4) The privately-run Zhonghua Xianqu Vocational School has not been established for long. More than 300 Xian opera performances have been produced, which is a remarkable achievement. Attention is also paid to the cleanliness and tidiness of students. The administrative organization is still organized. However, the school completely studies old operas. The teachers are opera performers, and the teaching methods are mostly outdated. Practicing martial arts often hinders the physical and mental development of young students. Attention should be paid to this. Moreover, drama is of great importance to social education. Special attention should be paid to drama reform to seek progress.</p>
<p>(5) The Municipal First Work-Study School enrolls fourth-grade primary school students and provides them with three years of higher primary school and vocational training. Classes are held for six hours a day with work-study. The work includes masonry, carpentry, and sewing, which is similar to a vocational supplementary school. It should be renamed the First Vocational Supplementary School to comply with regulations. Furthermore, it is said that most of the students in the school are from poor families and have few opportunities for further education. Therefore, they should be given sufficient vocational supplementary education, reduce general subjects, and increase practical work. The age limit for enrollment may be relaxed, and the length of study may be reduced appropriately. When necessary, a junior vocational course should be added to specialize in the main local handicrafts.</p>
<p>(6) The Municipal Huigong School is entirely elementary school in nature, except that the labor time is more than ordinary schools. Recently, the school and the Social Affairs Bureau agreed to increase the labor homework for fifth and sixth graders to 300 minutes per week, with printing and sewing. The intention is good. However, most of the students are children of workers. It seems appropriate to refer to the improvement methods of the First Work-Study School, increase vocational training, and rename it a Vocational Supplementary School. A special name should not exist.</p>
<p>(7) The Municipal Labor Night School and the Workers' Children's School established by the group are ordinary supplementary schools and have no labor meaning. They should live up to their names and increase vocational training, taking into account the students' family situation, and rename them all Vocational Supplementary Schools.</p>
<p>(8) The private Women's Western Painting School has achieved good results. It is generally satisfactory in terms of the level of higher women's art vocational education. It should be ordered to raise enough funds, increase equipment, and apply for registration in the name of a higher women's art vocational school.</p>
<p>(9) The five branches of the Xiangshan Ciyouyuan Private Charitable Institution are mechanics, dyeing and weaving, leather making, and carpet making. The finished products are good. In addition to factory work, there are one or two hours of classroom work per day, half of which are ordinary courses. However, the carpet department has no classroom work, and there are very few students. All work is done by workers. The administrative organization and management methods of the school are very lax. The annual business income and expenditure are almost equal. Efforts should be made to rectify it.</p>
<p>(10) According to the city's original plan, it is very important to increase the number of classes in the existing industrial and commercial schools and to gradually convert the Fifth Middle School into a vocational school. However, because the subsidy could not be issued according to the increased number, it was difficult to realize. Now the central subsidy has been issued according to the new amount from October of this year, with a monthly increase of 25,000 yuan. In addition to earmarking a small part for the establishment of elementary schools, the original plan to expand vocational education should be realized quickly. On the one hand, the content of each school should be enriched, and on the other hand, the number of classes should be increased. Furthermore, the Municipal Normal School currently has 12 grades, and the number of graduates each year is already too high. The number of classes should be reduced as soon as possible and transferred to vocational education or used to expand elementary schools. In this way, by shifting resources from less urgent to more urgent needs, the city's education can be expected to progress.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Sends Yang Zhi to Japan for Investigation</h3>
<p>▲ Shen Jiesheng and others held a farewell banquet last night</p>
<p>Yang Zhi, a Bachelor of Arts from Daxia University, has been working in the Municipal Education Bureau of this city since graduation. Mr. Yang is smart, capable, and excellent in both character and academics. In order to pursue further studies, he is going to study in Japan. Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Education Bureau has also sent him to investigate education. Mr. Yang's friends in Shanghai, Shen Jiesheng, Gu Jiwu, Xu Ze, Ling Xianwen, Xu Guanbin, Fan Peiyuan, Tong Shiji, etc., held a banquet at Guanshengyuan at 6 o'clock last night to bid farewell to Mr. Yang. It is learned that Mr. Yang has already taken the Nagasaki Maru to the east this morning. In the future, when he completes his studies and returns to China, he will make a contribution.</p>
<h3>Private Supplementary Schools Should Issue Certificates of Achievement</h3>
<p>▲ And Must Indicate the Period of Study and Subjects, etc.</p>
<p>▲ The Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to the supplementary schools yesterday to handle this matter.</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to the private supplementary schools in this city yesterday, which stated that Article 16 of the Regulations on Vocational Supplementary Schools stipulates that "students who have completed the period of study in a supplementary school shall be given a certificate of achievement by the school, and the certificate must indicate the period of study and the vocational subjects." All schools are required to comply with this regulation. Recently, it has been heard that each supplementary school issues graduation certificates to students who have completed their studies. The Municipal Education Bureau has returned them for correction. In the future, supplementary schools shall not submit graduation certificates to the Bureau for verification and printing. Correspondence schools and vocational training institutes shall also handle this matter in the same way.</p>
<h3>The Secondary School Entrance Examination Ends Today</h3>
<p>The fourth session of the secondary school student graduation examination in this city was the second day yesterday. The order in each examination hall was still good. Today is the last day. Both senior and junior high schools will take Chinese in the morning, and senior high schools will take Party Ideology and Physics in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>The Science Society of China Plans to Organize a Large-Scale Survey Team</h3>
<p>▲ The Survey of the Yangtze River Basin Will Take Twenty Years</p>
<p>▲ The Rockefeller Foundation Provides an Annual Grant of US$6,000</p>
<p>The Institute of Biology of the Science Society of China has been established for ten years. It has collected thousands of specimens of various natural products. Last year, it held a public exhibition of biology, which was rare in the country. Recently, it has been noted that our country is rich in natural resources. Scholars from Europe and the United States travel long distances to conduct surveys in the interior of our country every year. However, there is a lack of large-scale surveys by Chinese people. In view of this, the Society plans to organize a large-scale survey team after the completion of the biological science collection work in Hainan. The survey area will be the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, etc. in the Yangtze River Basin. The survey objects will be animals, plants, minerals, climate, forests, etc. A systematic and comprehensive investigation will be conducted. It is estimated that the survey time for each province will be two years, and the entire project will take about 20 years. In terms of funding, it is estimated that each province will cost about 20,000 yuan, and the total cost will be about 200,000 yuan. It is reported that the source of funding, in addition to the annual subsidy of 6,000 US dollars from the Rockefeller Foundation, will be raised by the Society itself. Once the funds are raised, it will organize a departure. If this move can be implemented, it will be a huge contribution to the cultural future of our country.</p>

<h3>Philistinism</h3>
<p>Gorky has a famous work called (The Song of the Falcon), which writes about a falcon flying into the sky with a yearning for freedom and light. It fell down in mid-air, landing exactly where a grass snake was lying. Its chest was pierced and its feathers were stained with blood, but the brave falcon did not regret it at all. He understood the glory of a battle). The grass snake, which was completely satisfied with the damp, warm burrow life, would not understand the falcon's brave behavior. He mocked the falcon's foolishness. Then he thought... (If the falcon wants to go to heaven so much, the life in the sky must be happy.) So he planned to fly into the sky himself to see clearly, forgetting that (anything that is born to crawl on its belly cannot fly). He shot his body into the air and fell on the rocks. The snake, however, thought that he had already flown into the sky and seen the sky. He laughed and said... (So the taste of flying into the sky means you have to fall down.) So he increasingly felt that those birds who were desperately trying to fly into the sky were (ridiculous), their (desires were crazy), their (inappropriateness for real life), and he triumphantly coiled his body on the rocks.</p>
<p>This (smart) snake is really the best specimen of philistinism. He is content with his own (damp, warm) life, and ridicules those who die for freedom and light as (ridiculous) and (crazy); or he has not formally participated in the battle, and declares that he will (leave the trenches) and still return to his own (damp, warm) old nest! These are the actions of philistines. They are born to crawl on their bellies, and you cannot find the spirit of leaping on them. Gorky said that philistinism represents a parasitic class, they are not productive and specialize in consumption. They promote the philosophy of the least resistance to personal growth, and seek a somewhat stable equilibrium between two forces. Envy, greed, vulgar gossip, mutual slander... these are all manifestations of philistinism.</p>
<p>Gorky's own greatness lies in the fact that he is the most thorough opponent of philistinism. The brave vagabonds and homeless people who love freedom in his early works are all existences that are in sharp contrast to the gray philistines, and radiate forever immortal light. All excellent writers almost all hold infinite contempt and hatred for the lukewarm, stingy, despicable, and vulgar of the civic layer. (Hatred of the civic layer is the first step in morality,) even the conservative Flaubert could not help but say this. Gautier once used fantasy costumes and long hair to fight against the vulgarity of the civic class, scolding the civic layer (only bowing down to five-franc gold coins, and having no other ideals than to preserve their own leather jackets). Pushkin was annoyed by the social upper class's vulgarity and wrote the following angry lines...</p>
<p>(Shame on love, throw away thoughts,</p>
<p>But devote yourself to buying and selling,</p>
<p>Kneel before idols,</p>
<p>Hope for gold and locks.)</p>
<p>However, although the writer himself hated the vulgarity of his own class, he could not agree to the severing of the roots of philistinism, and as a result he himself also (conformed to the vulgarity). Gautier goes without saying, even Pushkin later could not help but compromise with the philistines he despised, put the (lyric poem of free will) back into the (golden scabbard), stabbed the heart of philistinism, and would not stop no matter what, in literary history, only Gorky alone.</p>
<p>Even a great man like Goethe could not escape the criticism of being a (narrow-minded philistine). Goethe showed dissatisfaction with the environment, the pursuit of great causes, and the effort to change life in (Faust). But he sometimes became very conservative. He once said to Eckermann...</p>
<p>(Now there is too much talk about aristocratic politics and democratic politics... But this question was very simple when we were young. At that time, we neither looked at property nor cherished its value, so we were democrats. But if we have acquired some property in a long life, then we must make it safe, not only for ourselves, but also for our children, who are going to inherit our property. So in old age we all become aristocrats, no matter what views we held in our youth.)</p>
<p>After reading this passage, we can hardly believe that it came from the mouth of an (arrogant, worldly contemptuous genius). Why is Goethe such a philistine? This can only be found in the fact that he was a well-behaved young master of the Frankfurt City Council and a minister of Weimar himself.</p>
<h3>Words of the Lake</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>(1) Daming Lake</p>
<p>Perhaps because it is winter, the impression Daming Lake gave me was not as interesting or as good as I had imagined or seen in books; the entire lake surface has been cut into water ponds like fields by many small dikes, presumably to be used for planting cattails and other plants in spring and summer. The painted boats that go in to visit Lixia Pavilion and other places can only travel along the canal-like waterways. As for the interest in free floating such as (a flat boat can accommodate me) and (let a reed go as it pleases), it is of course impossible to fully enjoy it on the lake here. Moreover, the small dikes that crisscross the lake cannot be used for people to walk on. Those who are not happy to take a painted boat to travel can only look at the lake at the entrance.</p>
<p>There are not many tourists on the lake, and the painted boats and yachts are deserted at the entrance of the lake, letting the snow pile up. Two or three falcons in the sky hover over the lake, spreading their wings and circling for a long time. A few small boats collecting withered reeds slowly sway in the distant water ponds, which can be regarded as puncturing some of the dull silence.</p>
<p>There are historical sites and scenic spots such as Lixia Pavilion, Beiji Pavilion, and Tie Gong Temple in the lake for tourists to visit, but they do not arouse our interest, just like climbing Thousand Buddha Mountain without liking to visit temples. Because we feel that flying springs, waterfalls, mountains, and wilderness, no matter what, are more lovable than the heavily built palaces.</p>
<p>However, looking at Thousand Buddha Mountain from the lake is excellent. You think, when you are tired of traveling in the desolate lake, you suddenly raise your head and see the snow-capped sloping peaks shining in the sky, who wouldn't suddenly feel refreshed? However, this is not a good point of Daming Lake itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps in spring and summer, when the willows sway on the dikes and the lotus flowers bloom in the lake, the scenery is the most beautiful.</p>
<p>(2) Great Light Lake</p>
<p>Traveling to Daming Lake made me even more nostalgic for the Great Light Lake in Yangon. Although there are no weeping willows hanging over the dikes and no lotus flowers blooming in the lake, the green shade that never fades all year round and the clear lake water that can be seen at a glance make people feel happy at all times. The surroundings of the lake are surrounded by asphalt roads shaded by coconut trees, and the east, west, and north sides are inlaid with lush shrub forests. The heart of the lake is also dotted with some gentle slopes like felt grass. Therefore, it is extremely pleasant to sit, lie, or walk on the lake.</p>
<p>Whenever the golden sunset hangs on the waist of the Great Golden Pagoda, Western white-clothed women come in twos and threes to compete on the lake; and European children in red and green also scatter on the slopes, playing various games. Around Saturday afternoons, the municipal government's music team is arranged at the edge of the lake pavilion to play various entertaining songs. But these are not the reasons that make me happy about the Great Light Lake. What I like are the quiet sand roads that sometimes wind around the lake and sometimes enter the forest, which can pleasantly expose my feet, which have been walking in leather shoes all year round, and take a refreshing country walk; or lie on the grass under the forest where few people go, and let the pleasant tree colors and the charming lake light slowly nourish me.</p>
<p>There are no hawkers, no wine shops or tea shops, and no painted boats carrying wine and food like Daming Lake. Everything feels closer to nature, and the spirits of tourists are more fresh and refreshing. Moreover, the crows of tropical countries fly and crow in the forest in the morning and evening, and the lions and tigers in the zoo roar by the lake, which makes it feel like being in a deep mountain forest. This is also a point that makes it difficult for me to forget the Great Light Lake.</p>
<h3>Paradise Lost (Continued)</h3>
<p>The countryside is desolate, especially at night in winter and spring, when the dogs bark and the crows cry from time to time, which should add to the lonely atmosphere. But the children can dispel this loneliness. If the countryside can be compared to a ink painting, the children's cries do add a touch of vitality.</p>
<p>Naturally, the reason why children play is not to decorate the deserted facade of the village. They have not yet learned to cover up ugliness. They only know how to entertain themselves. They never consider how much good these entertainments give. They just play as they please, not only forgetting to go home late, but also (forgetting themselves). Therefore, there is still a lot of noise in the field until late at night, and they are unwilling to disperse unless adults urge them several times.</p>
<p>Entertainment is also a kind of education. Recently, it has attracted people's attention. I have not estimated how much value the various ways of playing in the countryside mentioned above have, but it is no less inferior to what is stipulated in schools. It is also a fact that it is too simple.</p>
<p>These simple ways of playing may be primitive, barbaric, and unreasonable in the eyes of educators, but there is no way to deal with it for the time being. Although it is just a group of (lawless) wild children, they will certainly not be uncivilized. However, there are too many restrictions on them from society. Even this barbaric way of playing is going to be lost. Isn't it a great pity?</p>
<p>The reason I lost Paradise was because my family still had some money. My father sent me to school. Then he died. I also reached adulthood, so I had to live like ordinary adults, so it was extremely ordinary. If I still ran to the light field of that paradise and joined that small team, even if it was a moonlit night, I am afraid it would cause an unusual reaction. I am no longer a child. However, every winter and spring evening, I can't help but imagine everything that happened in the field when I was a child. No matter how much distance there is in between, I still yearn for Paradise. Sometimes I sit down for a long time, clearly facing the paper wall, but I see a group of children catching, escaping, arguing, and making noise, and even hear whistles. In between, there is the light, floating sadness that cannot be avoided in life; gradually, I am separated from the children!</p>
<p>The year before last, I accidentally returned home because of an accident. The first thing that came to my mind was the paradise on the threshing floor. I had thought of it even when I didn't come. I don't know how many small comedies and tragedies have been staged on that small paradise, but I can't forget it because of the old feelings.</p>
<p>It was a late autumn night, the weather was not very cold, there was a good moon, and even the trees were illuminated like they should only be in fairy tales; I thought there must be a lot of excitement in the field, and I should use it to warm up my old dreams. But when I walked to the road to the threshing floor, I couldn't help but stop. The field was still very flat and clean, and the moonlight was still crystal clear and bright, but I couldn't see a single figure; even the noise and whistles seemed to be swept away by the cold moonlight together. On the street, I couldn't see anything that looked like a person moving. Only a dog hung its head, dragged its tail, and walked slowly, coughing in its mouth. But it was definitely not a fish bone stuck in its throat. I stood for a long time, and it was definitely not to admire the moon, but just stood there for no reason, letting the cool wind blow on my face. Perhaps I was at a loss. But the children who were (uneducated), of course, would not become extinct, so what happened? It couldn't be such a coincidence. But the next day, things became clear. I saw a child in front of the Earth God Temple, about eleven or twelve years old, thin and small, with a withered face, so withered that he looked somewhat old. It was definitely a child. But this child's standing appearance absorbed me. He stood, sticking out his left foot, in a (rest) posture, but his left arm was across his chest, holding his right elbow joint, and his right elbow joint was bent up. A local-made cigarette was clipped between his index and middle fingers. He looked up and stared at the wild, smoking leisurely. Although he didn't pay attention to the surroundings, anyone would be moved, perhaps surprised. He was a hooligan, a sailor looking forward to his homeland, but wasn't he more like an adult?</p>
<p>Violence initially only affected adults, and children were only indirectly affected. Gradually, adults were not enough to fill that greedy mouth. This poisonous net also captured children. They were stripped of their innocence and forced to take on the tasks of adults. They had to bear the sorrows of adults. All happiness was squeezed out. They were originally children who should only be playing, but they had already picked up cigarettes and smoked like adults. No one has mentioned this yet; where is our (genius)!</p>
<p>These words are only about eight or nine years away from when I was a child. It doesn't seem like a long time, but there have been such big changes in eight or nine years. The children have lost even the paradise that was not so good. Now it is almost three years again. How are the children? Who knows?</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Life should be an adventure, not easy, like swinging in a dream; each person climbs to the spire of the tower of life, and the exhausted in the middle fall and are injured.</p>
<p>The coagulation of heart, blood, sweat, and strength, life is pushing a cart; when the energy is like the oil is dry, once the hand is thrown, the wheel can no longer move forward.</p>
<h3>The Fly (8)</h3>
<p>—By Pirandello, translated by Xi Dichun</p>
<p>It went to rest on Neri's cheek. From his cheek, now slowly, but with two legs, it ran down to his chin, right to the place cut by the razor, and greedily lingered there.</p>
<p>Chai Lu stared intently and attentively at it there, watched it for a long while, and then, with a suppressed distress, asked in a hollow voice...</p>
<p>(Could it be a fly?)</p>
<p>(A fly? Why not?) the doctor replied. Chai Lu said nothing more; he continued to stare at the fly. Neri, as if numbed by the doctor's words, did not wave it away. Chai Lu ignored the doctor, but he was happy in his heart that this remark had so absorbed his cousin's attention, to the point of standing as still as a stone, so that he did not notice the fly's tickling on his chin.</p>
<p>Ah! If only it were this one! Then they would really... get married! His heart was seized by a deep jealousy, a blind, fierce jealousy towards his young and beautiful cousin. For Neri, life was still full of hope, while on the other hand, life was hopeless for him, Chai Lu—</p>
<p>Suddenly, Neri seemed to finally feel himself being stung, raised his hand to chase away the fly, and used his fingers to rub the small cut on his chin. He turned to Chai Lu, saw the strange smile spreading across those terrible lips, and was somewhat flustered. They stared at each other intently for a moment. Then Chai Lu said, almost without intending to...</p>
<p>(Fly—)</p>
<p>Neri couldn't understand and leaned closer to listen.</p>
<p>(What did you say?) (Fly—) he repeated. (Which one? Where?) Neri asked, his heart pounding, while looking at the doctor.</p>
<p>(Right where you scratched yourself. Certainly.) Chai Lu said. Neri showed the cut on his chin to the doctor.</p>
<p>(What got on there? It's so itchy...)</p>
<p>The doctor looked at the cut, frowning; then, as if to take a closer look, he led him outside the stable. Sa Luo followed him.</p>
<p>What happened again? Chai Lu waited, waited for a long time, with a gripping unease in his heart. He heard people talking loudly outside, and suddenly Sa Luo rushed back into the stable, grabbed the mule, and left without even turning his head, crying</p>
<p>(Ah, my poor little Neri! Ah, my poor little Neri!)</p>
<p>So, it's true then? They're just leaving him here like a dog? He tried hard to prop himself up and shouted twice (Sa Luo! Sa Luo!)</p>
<p>Silence. No one outside. He stopped propping himself up and fell back into a lying position; he began to murmur, so as not to hear the silence of the wilderness, which frightened him. Suddenly he thought he was dreaming, suffering from a nightmare in his fever; but, turning back to the wall again, he saw the fly.</p>
<p>It was there.</p>
<p>Sometimes it would extend and retract its tiny sucking organ, and sometimes it would nimbly wash its slender legs, rubbing them together, as if satisfied. (The End)</p>

<h3>Financial Speculation: Silver Prices Expected to Decline</h3>
<p>Speculation Margin Increases by Six Yuan Again</p>
<p>Occasional Selling Pressure Quickly Dissipated by Central Bank Intervention</p>
<p>The gold market continued to rise yesterday due to the decline in the silver market and favorable conditions for buyers. Major sellers were still eager to sell. The exchange rate market was normal, even slightly weak, but due to occasional cash injections by the central bank, market sentiment was unusually excited and prone to prosperity. It was observed that early morning foreign dispatches indicated that the silver markets in both the UK and the US had fallen, and the forward silver price in Monterey had also decreased by half a penny to a full penny. The exchange rate also fell. The price of spot gold in London rose by five and a half pence. There were signs that the US government was easing its silver purchasing program, and there were differing opinions within China's financial community regarding monetary policy. However, most bankers and senior advisors to the Minister of Finance agreed with Song Ziwen's proposal to reduce the exchange rate against the US dollar to 25 US cents, or one-quarter. These news items, which were reported in detail in the newspapers, agitated the minds of speculative investors. Pre-market transactions opened and immediately rose to 71.2 yuan. After the opening, the demand from major buyers varied, but was mostly bullish. However, due to credible news, the Central Bank lowered its listed exchange rates by 1.25 for the British pound and 4.375 for the US dollar. The Customs Gold Unit soared by 0.5%. The standard price for speculation margins rose to 1000.2 yuan. The market sentiment became even more excited and ultimately rose. However, as major players took advantage of the high prices to sell, the market gradually declined. The appetite of banks varied. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced a decrease of 1.25 for the British pound and 3.75 for the US dollar. There was considerable struggle after the lower rates were announced, but the exchange rate market was normal and gradually hardened. Major players sold again, and for a time, supply exceeded demand, breaking the 70 yuan mark. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to engage in activity, managing to maintain the level. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. At this time, a Reuters dispatch stated that the congressional budget was expected to reduce the silver coinage tax to US$25,000,000, and the Ministry of Finance's expression of silver policy indicated that Shanghai was rumored to be reducing the silver purchasing program. The market remained relatively stable. However, the exchange rate market remained loose, and banks were also releasing funds, leading to a period of selling activity that turned weak. However, there were quite a few people taking advantage of the low prices to buy, and the Central Bank also intervened to inject spot goods, with prices ranging from 962 yuan to 2.5 yuan, and a speculation margin reduction of 8 yuan. The Guang Gang aggressively supplied contracts, and although there was a pullback, the buying sentiment was still strong. By noon, the overall trend was stable, and the afternoon market turned weak. The market broke the 70 yuan mark immediately upon opening, and selling pressure suddenly increased, causing a decline. Banks were still eager to buy, gradually pulling up the prices. The initial report from the Indian silver market indicated a sharp drop of 12 annas, followed by reports that President Roosevelt's speech had triggered selling pressure in the Bombay market, with new short positions being established, leading to a final result of a catastrophic drop of 1 rupee and 6 annas. The market broke through the 70 yuan mark, and buying sentiment suddenly recovered, causing a rise. Although there was some supply, major players were aggressively buying at the lower prices, making it easier to recover after the decline. The domestic market gradually tightened. Rumors spread that the Central Bank had again injected spot goods, with a price of 964 yuan and a speculation margin reduction of 10 yuan. Buyers became even more eager, and speculator Luo increased his bets, triggering another surge. Banks reluctantly released funds at higher prices, causing a slight decline. At this time, major players fought back with their demand for supply, still struggling, but ultimately, due to the large number of sellers, the Indian silver market rebounded by 7 annas for the second time. The market closed lower. The Central Bank reportedly opened approximately 1,000 or more spot positions, generally 8 yuan lower than the speculation margin. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 972.7 yuan, up 6 yuan from the previous close. It then fell to 2.5 yuan. Hengxing Dafa Yong, etc., advanced to 3.8 yuan. Dafa Yong Dadecheng Tongchun sold off, dropping to 2 yuan. The Central Bank announced its listed exchange rates, with the Customs Gold Unit rising 0.5%. Fuchang Yuanmao Yongheng Yuyuan Kangxiang, etc., competed to advance, rising to 5 yuan. Although Fuxing Yong Yongli Hengyu sold off to 3.5 yuan, they rebounded to 4.7 yuan due to Yuanmao Yong Fuxing Yong's advances. Dadecheng Hengxing Tianfeng mutually sold off, dropping to 1.5 yuan. Huabi bought US dollars for February at 33.75. Shunmao Huixiang still advanced to 3.5 yuan. Dadecheng Fuxing Yong sold contracts, dropping to around 2 yuan. Huixiang Yongfeng continued to advance, with some recovery. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced its listed exchange rates, with the British pound down 1.25 and the US dollar down 3.75. Market sentiment remained uncertain, and the exchange rate market also hardened. US dollars for March at 56.25 were difficult to sell. Dadecheng Yuan Yi Hengyu Hengxing Yuanchang Yong jointly sold off, dropping to 69.5 yuan. Hengxing Yu Hengchang Yong Zhentai Shenkang Hengyu, etc., bought in at the lower prices, gradually recovering to above 71 yuan. However, due to Zhaofeng Chang Fuchang Dadecheng Shunmao continuing to sell and being mostly bullish, Yuanchang Yong sold contracts again, retreating to within 70 yuan. Hengyu Fuxing Zhengchang, etc., bought in, recovering to above 1 yuan. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. At this time, Reuters dispatches stated that the US Congress was expected to reduce the silver coinage tax by 75% in 1936, and that there were talks of reducing the silver purchasing program, which was quite stable. Yuan Yi Shunmao Yuanchang Yong Fuxing Yong Qianchang Xiang, etc., continued to supply contracts, and the bullish side slightly wavered, dropping to 68.7 yuan. Huabi wanted to buy US dollars for February at 8.75. Fuchang Ding Kang Jia Kang Yuanmao Yong Qianchang Xiang Dadecheng Yuqing Yong Yuan Kangxiang Yukang, etc., entered contracts one after another. There was news that the Central Bank had opened 350 spot positions at a price of 962 yuan, causing a recovery to 72 yuan. Qianchang Xiang Dafa Yong Hengyu Shunmao Zhaofeng Chang Hengxing sold, dropping to 0.05 yuan. Tongfeng Heng Hengyu Yuanmao Yong Yuansheng Yong, etc., still advanced to 2.5 yuan. Shengda aggressively sold contracts, and Hongkang Yong, etc., also sold, retreating to 1.1 yuan. Zhengchang Yuan Yi came to buy, gradually rising to 2.7 yuan. Yuanmao Yong sold off at the higher prices, dropping to 1.4 yuan. Hengyu, etc., maintained the level, and the afternoon closed at 971.6 yuan. The market remained stable after the close.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 968.7 yuan. Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Zhaofeng Chang, etc., all sold off, dropping to 7.3 yuan. Citibank bought US dollars for March at 75. Yuanmao Yong Yuanchang Yong Yuan Yi Dingkang came to buy at the lower prices, rising to around 9 yuan. When the Indian silver report arrived, the initial drop was 12 to 13 annas, and it was said that the Indian silver market had been triggered selling pressure due to President Roosevelt's speech, with new short positions being established, and the final drop was even greater, reaching 1 rupee and 6 annas, 1 rupee and 3 annas, and 1 rupee and 8 annas. The market was flooded with buyers. Yuanmao Yong Yuanheng Dachang Xiang Hengyu Changda Zhaofeng Chang Dadecheng Zhentai Fuxing, etc., all entered, and although Changsheng Yong Yifeng Yong, etc., supplied in the middle, there was a brief consolidation, but the overall demand exceeded supply, rising to 72.8 yuan. The Great Britain released US dollars for February at 93.75. Bingxing Yukang supplied contracts, dropping to 1.2 yuan. At this time, Dadecheng bought in from time to time, while Fuxing Yong Hengyu sold, struggling between 1 and 2 yuan. Later, Yuanchang Yong Shunli Qianchang Xiang Yuan Yi, etc., sold, dropping to 0.05 yuan. Dadecheng continued to aggressively buy again, gradually rising. In addition, there were reports that the Central Bank had opened 210 spot positions at a price of 964 yuan. Yuqing Yong Zhentai Dingkang Dadecheng, etc., re-entered, gradually rising to 5.7 yuan. Fuxing Yong Yuan Yi Shunmao sold contracts at the higher prices, dropping to 3.8 yuan. Dingchang Yi Yu Futai Heng continued to aggressively buy, rising to 5 yuan. Qianchang Xiang Changda Fuyu Dadecheng Shenkang Shunmao, etc., sold off one after another. The Indian silver market rebounded by 7 annas, retreating to 2.6 yuan. The market closed at 972.8 yuan. After the close, Dafa Yong Dadecheng Wanxing came to buy, rising to above 3 yuan. Dadecheng Hengyu Qingyong sold off, retreating to 2.5 yuan. It was observed that the highest price of the day was 975.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 967.3 yuan, with a total fluctuation of 8.4 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 6.1 yuan higher than the previous closing price.</p>
<p>The settlement price was listed by the Central Bank's standard speculation margin price as 1000.2 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 27 yuan higher, which was approximately 4 yuan higher than the previous closing price. The registered price for this month was 958 yuan, and for February it was 972 yuan. The morning water supplement was 958 yuan, and the afternoon water supplement was 959 yuan. The price of pure gold was 967 yuan, reduced by 5 yuan. The spot market was even more popular. This was due to the improved environment, which led to increased buying sentiment. Tianjin goods had already been priced at 1 yuan above the speculation margin, and there were few sellers. After the Central Bank released spot goods in the previous session, it continued to open spot positions yesterday, with Tongfeng Heng Fuchang Dafeng Heng Dadecheng, etc., selling more than 1,000 contracts at prices ranging from 962 yuan to 2.5 yuan, generally 8 yuan lower than the speculation margin. It was heard that there were another 210 contracts in the afternoon at a price of 964 yuan, 10 yuan lower than the speculation margin. This was all due to the shorts posting the difference to close out their positions. The contracts for this month have been completely cleared after today's official sheet settlement.</p>
<p>The market transactions were quite active, with varying demands for supply. However, due to the Central Bank's opening of spot margins, demand generally exceeded supply. In summary, Tongfeng Heng Qingfa Yong Hengchang Yong Hengyu Dafa Yong Yiyu Fuchang Huixiang Dingchang Dingkang Futai Heng Fuxing Wanxing Dadecheng, etc., were on the buying side. Shunmao Shengda Yuan Yi Yongde Fuxing Yong Yuanchang Yong Shunli Bingxing Zhaofeng Chang Tongchun Yicheng Yongli, etc., were on the selling side. Yuanheng Yuanchang Yong Dafa Yong Yongli Tianfeng Dadecheng first exited and then entered. Hengxing Qianchang Xiang Fuyu Changda first advanced and then exited. The Dalian gang Wanxing did a total of 1,100 contracts, settling 200 contracts. Shunli did a total of 500 contracts, settling 200 contracts. The Guang gang sold a total of 900 contracts. Hengxing did a total of 200 to 300 contracts each for advances and exits. The total number of transactions on the day was 38,150 contracts in the morning and 34,573 contracts in the afternoon. The total number of February chips was 24,283 contracts. In total, there were 57 bullish parties and 58 bearish parties.</p>

The market hardened thereafter, but Reuters' dispatch regarding the US potentially reducing the silver coinage tax provided some support. The silver equalization tax announcement remained unchanged, still levying 6.25%. The general trend was set with the British pound calculated at 1 shilling, 5 pence and 6.875 points. After the opening, banks repeatedly sold off, and the process hardened, but the Central Bank's injection of spot goods made the market relatively stable at noon. The afternoon market was still loose, and Chinese merchants sold US dollars, while banks took the opportunity to buy, providing support. Later, President Roosevelt's speech triggered selling pressure in Bombay. The Indian silver market initially plummeted by 1 rupee and 6 annas. The market tightened due to reports that the Central Bank was injecting funds. Banks sold off at higher prices, and the Indian silver market rebounded by 7 annas, slightly stabilizing.

<h3>Call Loan Market Continues to Decline</h3>

The water added to call loans was more than four-fifths less than last week.

The trading volume was 800,000 in the afternoon, with over 1.2 million in the small general association.

<h3>Securities Market Approaches End of Lunar Year, Bond Market Quiet and Uninspired</h3>
<p>(Very Few New Transactions Except for Futures Spreads and Closing Trades)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the Chinese Securities Exchange seemed to have gradually entered a period of consolidation. Call loans were only 4 cents, another 8 points lower than before, but market prices were not excited by this, and buyers were not enthusiastic. Major players continued to sell, making it difficult to see a good turnaround quickly. Due to the slack in market sentiment, the market was desolate. There were very few new transactions except for closing trades and futures spreads. Although call loans had eased and market sentiment was not boosted, even if the environment was good, short positions were not covered. There was no strength to rise and no ease to fall, so the future may not avoid a period of consolidation. Yesterday morning, the market opened with a sudden drop in call loans. Retail investors were not weak in entering the market, but trading was not enthusiastic. Sellers were relatively scarce, and market prices rose, continuing to increase by 1-2 cents to about 4 cents compared to the previous day. The tail-end listing was relatively weak. In the second session, numbers 21 and 48 were heavily sold, and market prices were immediately suppressed, and the trend changed from high to low. The atmosphere changed abruptly, and market sentiment became uncertain. After that, there was a consistent decline, with the larger falls being about half a yuan. The gains in the first session were completely lost. There were no rumors in the market, indicating that although silver funds were slightly eased on the surface, major shorts did not cover, and the purchasing power of retail investors was gradually satisfied. There was no reason for market prices to rise. The afternoon situation was even more chaotic, and trading was extremely quiet. Most people were watching. The market opened calmly, with most prices slightly higher by 1-2 cents, and a few slightly higher by 0.05 to 0.1 cents. Closing prices were mostly slightly lower by about 0.1 cents. As the Lunar New Year approached, there seemed to be a contraction. The market price results were mostly slightly lower by 0.05 to 0.1 cents to 0.3 cents, with two or three types slightly higher by 0.05 to 0.1 cents. The total transaction volume was 9,522,000 yuan. The increase/decrease results are listed in the table below. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>US Railroad Stocks Lead the Gains</h3>
<p>The New Feng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 7th), the New York stock market was positively influenced by President Roosevelt's budget address. Railroad stocks led the advance. While traders felt uneasy about the unbalanced 1936 budget, this was offset by the President's declaration that there were no plans to impose new taxes. Steel stocks rose due to increased steel production last week. Railroad stocks also rose because it was widely expected that the government would soon provide relief to various routes. The bond market was strong and active, with a very positive reaction to the budget address. Stocks on the small exchange also rose. The total daily turnover was 1.29 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>5th　　5th　　Rise/Fall</p>
<p>Thirty Industrials　105.56　105.88　Up 0.22</p>
<p>Twenty Railroads　36.82　37.26　Up 0.44</p>
<p>Twenty Utilities　17.68　17.64　Down 0.04</p>

<p>Eleven Commodities　61.84　62.04　Up 0.20</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Japanese Yarn Merchants Swapping Short Positions</h3>
<p>Transaction Volume of Marked Yarn Gradually Decreasing</p>
<p>The yarn market is stable, but the situation is unusually scattered. Trading in the market is becoming increasingly quiet because merchants find it difficult to change their habits. The end of the lunar year is approaching, and the scope of business operations is gradually shrinking. Therefore, both buyers and sellers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Many blackboards are being cleared, and market fluctuations are becoming minimal. However, Japanese merchants have already begun swapping their short positions.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster Quietly Firm) The opening of the marked yarn market was up, and the market sentiment appeared good. Due to the rise in US cotton, Mr. Wu is still taking delivery this month, which further stabilized people's confidence. However, trading in the market was unusually quiet, and major long and short traders remained inactive. As a result, all months rose by 1, 2, and 5 jiao. In the afternoon opening, it was reported that spot yarn business was quiet, but prices remained high. Japanese merchants are taking delivery this month and releasing distant months for swapping. All months rose again by 3, 4, and 5 jiao. It was found that Mai Chu sold 450 bales, Da Chang 400 bales, Shen Ji 500 bales, Yuan Da 400 bales, Heng De 400 bales, and Chang Feng 300 bales. Jin Chang bought 1250 bales, Geng Feng 900 bales, Tong Ji 300 bales, Yuan Yi 200 bales, and Da Fu 200 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices during the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Rise/Fall　Inventory</p>
<p>January　184.9　184.4　184.8　Up 0.40　38,250</p>
<p>February　185.9　185.3　185.9　0.60　45,450</p>
<p>March　186.8　186.3　187.5　0.50　54,300</p>
<p>April　188.5　188.1　188.5　0.50　53,900</p>
<p>May　189.5　188.9　189.1　0.60　29,000</p>
<p>June　189.7　189.4　189.7　0.50　3,700</p>
<p>Total　　　　　　　　　　224,650</p>
<p>(Actual Sales Decreasing) Sales of spot yarn have slightly slowed down. Statistics show that all gangs bought a total of 660 bales throughout the day. Prices are stable. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows: Inland 106, Guangdong 375, Jiangxi 50, Ningbo 3, Changsha 75, and fellow merchants 50.</p>
<h3>Cotton Slightly Turning Around</h3>
<p>The cotton market is showing signs of recovery again. US and Indian cotton are rising, and gold is also rising. Exchange rates are trending lower, and people's confidence is stable. However, both long and short traders are remaining inactive, so transactions are particularly sparse. Although spot cotton mills are not engaging in large-scale transactions, retail business is still continuous.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Near and Distant Terms Both Up One Jiao) The marked cotton market opened steadily. Rumors from the previous day about yarn mills stopping production were completely unfounded, and US and Indian cotton markets were rising together. The gold market continued to be firm, so people's confidence rebounded and was not as weak as the previous day. Some short positions were covered. As a result, all months rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao. In the afternoon, it was reported that British factories were actively procuring spot cotton and that there were huge amounts involved. Market conditions became even tighter. However, the market weakened slightly towards closing. As a result, all months rose again by 5 fen. It was found that Yi Yu sold 500 dan, Rui Da 1300 dan, and Chang Feng 1800 dan. Jin Chang bought 1900 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 1700 dan, and Jun Chang 800 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices during the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Marked Cotton　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Rise/Fall　Inventory</p>
<p>January　36.60　36.50　36.55　Up 0.10　119,900</p>
<p>February　37.10　37.05　37.10　0.15　159,900</p>
<p>March　37.75　37.65　37.70　0.10　162,900</p>
<p>April　37.95　37.80　37.90　0.10　134,600</p>
<p>May　38.20　38.10　38.15　0.10　83,500</p>
<p>June　38.30　38.30　38.20　0.10　8,600</p>
<p>Total　　　　　　　　　　669,400</p>
<p>(Spot Cotton Mills Slightly Increasing Purchases) Sales of spot cotton are still good, and the purchases of various mills have slightly increased. The sources include Yao cotton 595 bales and Tong cotton 780 bales.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton　62.50　Inland and Foreign Mills Purchases　184 pieces　Spot goods delivered to Chuzhou Mill</p>

<h3>US Cotton Reverses Trend Before Close</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with unfavorable news from Liverpool. Long positions were liquidated, and the Bombay gang sold off, with all months falling by 2 to 4 points. Subsequently, fellow traders bought in, and the securities and wheat markets were strong. Sellers decreased, and the market situation recovered. There were few new transactions. Fellow traders were waiting for developments from Washington. Before closing, fellow traders and foreign firms bought in, and short positions were covered. Wall Street was strong, so the closing market situation was very firm and strong. Spot cotton was up 10 points, and futures were up 5 to 9 points. (Although the budget message confirmed the possibility of expansion, the cotton market was not greatly affected. According to exchange estimates, world cotton consumption in January last year was 2,133,000 bales, compared to 2,150,000 bales in the same period last year.) The British cotton market was weak, with spot prices down 2 points and futures down 4 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by long position manipulators, but then fell back due to selling by brokers and a few retail investors. Pingguoer was up 2.5 jiao, while Aomula and Bailuoxi were both up 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 7th):</p>
<p>US Cotton　Compared to Previous Day　Equivalent in National Currency　British Cotton　Compared to Previous Day　Equivalent in National Currency</p>
<p>1　12.55　Up 9　40.50　Spot 7.20　Down 2　47.40</p>
<p>3　12.65　9　40.80　1　6.88　45.30</p>
<p>5　12.73　9　41.00　2　6.87　45.20</p>

<p>Aomula　236.50　1.00　35.20</p>
<p>Bailuoxi　238.50　1.00　37.10</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 8th is 240 rupees, up 1.5 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Flour Standard Often Shorted</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was steady in the morning after opening, with prices for each month being equivalent to foreign wheat. Chicago was up by between a corner and a triangle, while Canada was up by 8 fen and zero. When prices were announced, trading in each month became quiet, and the dumping of goods by various factories also became quiet. Off-market short positions were instead covered. This month, sales from the North Road to customers are active, and standard flour is often shorted, so people's confidence is tight. Distant terms are also stable because shipments are very quiet. By the afternoon opening, this month's actual sales were still active, and prices were firmly increasing. Distant terms rose step by step due to slight buying by outsiders. However, with the end of the lunar year approaching, customers are mostly closing their transactions, so future transactions will likely be temporarily quiet. As a result, this month was up 1 fen and 7 li and a half, February was up 2 fen, March was up 2 fen and 2 li and a half, April was up 2 fen, May was up 1 fen and 7 li and a half, and June was up 2 fen and 7 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Futures Market Suddenly Rises to Cover Shorts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market turned profitable, with prices for foreign wheat continuing to be good, up by around 8 fen to a triangle and a half. When prices were announced, buying and selling this month failed to approach, and everything was sold through auctions. Distant terms rose because foreign wheat rose and spot wheat sales have stopped recently, so people's confidence is looking good. February and March were up between 3 and 4 fen. By the afternoon opening, this month opened up 4 fen due to short covering, and then prices fluctuated. Distant term transactions were still smooth, with prices similar to the morning. The situation in the spot wheat market will ultimately depend on changes in foreign wheat. As a result, this month was up 4 fen, and February was up 6 fen, March was up 4 fen. The spot wheat market has been abandoned for many days. Yesterday, due to rain, factory purchases were average. Medium-grade and lower-grade wheat prices were reduced by 2-3 fen. Shandong wheat was quoted at 4 yuan and 5 fen, Yaowan Suqian wheat was 4 yuan and another 3 fen, lower by 1 fen, and Xiangshuikou wheat was 3 yuan and 9 jiao and a half. Hua Feng, Shen Da, and Fu Feng sold over 1,200 bags.</p>
<p>▲Chicago wheat, factory purchases, spot supply is scarce. This week, supply is expected to decrease by approximately 2,901,000 bushels.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat　January 6　January 7　Rise/Fall</p>
<p>May　100.75　101.75　Up 1.00</p>
<p>July　93.875　94.25　Up 0.375</p>
<p>September　92.50　92.50　No Change</p>
<p>Spot　108.50　109.75　Up 1.25</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat　January 6　January 7　Rise/Fall</p>
<p>May　83.875　84.00　Up 0.125</p>
<p>July　84.375　84.50　Up 0.155</p>
<p>Spot　79.50　79.75　Up 0.15</p>
<h3>River Rice Prices Rise Amidst Rain</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources for each gang are similar to yesterday, with a total of over 30 establishments (nearly 6,000 shi of goods in total). Business is quiet due to rain, but people's confidence is strengthened because of the rain. Sellers are quite vocal in demanding higher prices. The supply of various superior glutinous rice from each establishment is limited. Coupled with Chiqi rice, there is more late-season rice, creating an average situation, but some have increased by several fen or jiao. Dujian rice is showing signs of strength due to shortages for two dynasties. Foreign pointed rice is still lacking, with no market and little change in price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over ten establishments brought goods from Hebei and the inland areas. Sales are normal across the board, and prices for white glutinous rice, guest pointed rice, and transformed yuan rice are all stable. Early thin rice is firm.</p>
<h3>Two Ships of Guangdong Xian Rice Arrive Again</h3>
<p>-Imported Rice Is Flat and Weak Again-</p>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market situation was that because arrivals and inventory levels were full, in addition to wholesale shipments, retail arrivals were also continuous. The market fell again yesterday. New trading in imported rice yesterday was limited due to the fact that production prices were not loose. Foreign merchants were unwilling to sell low, and the whole market only opened 500 tons of Saigon rice for January delivery, thrown out by Shun Quan Long, with a price of 4 yuan and 8 jiao. Although the goods were different, this was a reduction of slightly 6 or 7 fen. There were no throwouts for March and April, so returned goods were still able to stand their ground, but trading was not much. If Ruming Foreign Firm throws out again, it may be necessary to gradually reduce prices. Spot imported rice of various Siamese Saigon rice varieties is being offered at 3,800 bags, with all prices reduced by more than slightly 5 fen. As there are relatively few arrivals and stockpiles of guest xian rice, and prices have risen at the origin, the market is more stable than imported rice. The whole city sent 4,170 bags to inland areas through this street.</p>
<p>A batch of Guangdong xian rice arrived in Shanghai a month ago. Because there was suspicion of being mixed with imported rice, a dispute arose. Recently, rice merchants in the South City continued to ship two batches to Shanghai, arriving by Taikoo Wheel's Zhejiang and Jiangsu ships, totaling more than 12,000 bags. High-quality goods opened at 11 yuan and 7 jiao, and low-quality goods were reduced to 10 yuan and 7 fen. All of them were directly allocated to rice shops by rice merchants and were not sold publicly at the association.</p>

<h3>Yellow Soybeans Difficult to Stay Strong</h3>
<p>- Several Restraints -</p>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market remained strong. Although trading in the market was light, sellers were determined to sell, and the market was tense. Prices continued to rise by five or six points, two jiao higher than the market last week. Currently, sources from the Jinpu Railway are unlikely to arrive due to the obstruction of war donations, and sources from the Longhai Railway are also scarce due to the joint transportation with Haizhou. Yangtze River soybeans are also scarce due to tight money and few traders, so the future of the soybean market is quite stable. Yesterday, the market opened with over 3,000 packages of Hankou Zha soybeans, which were handled by Xichang and local streets. Shashi soybeans opened with 500 packages, also destined for the interior. Factories purchased seventeen carts of Dalian Siping Street soybeans at a price of four yuan and five fen. Interior cart shops purchased three carts of large soybeans at prices of four yuan and three and a half jiao and three jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse Granulated White Rises Half a Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's currency market saw a rise in spot shortages of coarse granulated white sugar. The price of domestic green sugar rose by two or three jiao due to increased land prices, and merchants also asked for two or three jiao more, with a general trend of tightness. The Public Association quoted spot prices for ordinary coarse granulated white sugar at 18 yuan and 9 jiao, and goods from this store at 19 yuan, a rise of half a jiao. Re-exported goods were at 5 yuan and 3 jiao, a rise of seven fen. Good #9 Dutch Red sugar was at 14 yuan and 4 jiao for spot, and Taikoo B Mark was at 19 yuan and two and a half jiao. The factory's fine white sugar was also tight, with #1 being called up by one jiao to 18 yuan and 2 jiao. Guang Merchants offered 100 pieces of Shimen green at 9 yuan and 6 jiao. Dozens of baskets of Changan green were offered at 9 yuan and 8 jiao. Jian Merchants offered over 20 packages of Tongan green at 9 yuan and 7 jiao. Quanzhou red was at 14 yuan and 2 jiao. Chao Merchants' asking prices also increased as the local price of Chao green rose, requiring a premium of 10 yuan and 8, but merchants seemed to have enough goods and were watching without moving forward.</p>

<h3>The Completion of the North Hei Railway</h3>
<p>- Hu Renmu</p>
<p>The Reuters Harbin dispatch the other day gave us a noteworthy piece of news. The news said that the North Hei Railway has been completed.</p>
<p>Opening a map of Northeast China, near Hailun at the northern end of the Hu-Hai Railway in Heilongjiang Province, we can find a black dot about the size of a millet grain. This is Beian Town, which is also the starting point of the North Hei Railway, and Heihe is the end point.</p>
<p>Why is the North Hei Railway worthy of our attention? Its own importance, it can be said, is definitely not like what the Reuters telegram said, that the wheat produced along the route will have a way to be transported and sold, and it will be a main line for developing the barren areas of northern Heilongjiang (something to that effect). Although this is reasonable and speakable, the writer believes that the place where it deserves our attention should belong to the military aspect!</p>
<p>We know that since Japanese imperialism forcibly occupied the four eastern provinces, it has been working hard on various constructions in the Northeast, especially military constructions. This includes the construction of railways and motor roads, the development of inland waterways, and the development of aviation networks. Railway construction is the most prominent, and the North Hei Railway is only one of them.</p>
<p>However, the mission undertaken by the North Hei Railway is indeed significant. Starting from the port of Najin in Korea on the west coast of the Sea of Japan (which Japan considers a key point for controlling the port of Vladivostok in the Soviet Union), the railway crosses the Tumen River and connects to the Ji-Hui Railway (Jilin to Huining). At the Lafa station, it connects to the La-Bin Railway (Lafa station to Harbin), which was completed this autumn. This is the shortest route from the Korean Peninsula to Harbin, shorter than the route from Sinuiju via Andong, turning from Anfeng Road to the South Manchurian Railway, and then to the Harbin-Changchun Line, or from Ji-Hui Road via Jilin, turning to the Jilin-Changchun Road, and then to the Harbin-Changchun Line. Harbin is an important town in northern Manchuria, and Japanese imperialism must retain it militarily whether for Manchuria or for itself (?). The La-Bin Railway crosses the river from Harbin and connects to the Hei Road. Thus, a straight-line-like reptile appeared on the map of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. That is to say, it is very convenient to travel from the port of Najin in Korea to Heihe in Heilongjiang, and naturally there is the same convenience in military transportation. Over the years, the Japanese imperialism has been taking a step-by-step offensive strategy against the Soviet Union. This road is the scissors for cutting off the Siberian Railway of Soviet Russia. Across the Heihe River is Hailanpao. From here, pushing forward is the Siberian Railway.</p>
<p>In a word, the completion of the North Hei Railway makes us worthy of attention because it more clearly exposes the further military advancement of Japan against the Soviet Union. When the future one layer by layer of advancement reaches a point where it cannot be resolved, war will naturally break out. At that time, this railway will have completed its mission.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand Faces</h3>
<p>- Jing Yun</p>
<p>The sun had just climbed out from below the horizon, and the weather was already so hot that it was suffocating. I had to carry a bucket to the river to cool off.</p>
<p>According to the experience of Old "Fan Ke" (people generally and habitually regard Siam and the Southeast Asian archipelagoes as "Fan Bang" or foreign lands, and therefore those who go there are called "Fan Ke" or foreign sojourners), Uncle Changchun, as soon as the Great Heat arrives, one has to carry a bucket to the river to cool off in the early morning before the sun has climbed out. This can make the mind and body cool and refreshed, and eliminate the entanglements of disease. Although Uncle Changchun has become an old "Fan Ke" and has spent more than thirty years in "Ten Thousand Faces," he still does the same thing every time the Great Heat arrives.</p>
<p>("Ah, the weather is really terribly hot!")</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the rooster in the chicken coop under the coconut tree woke Uncle Changchun up. Habitually, he rubbed his sleepy eyes, spat out this often-recited, worn-out tune, and then, alone, carried his bucket and walked slowly to the river.</p>
<p>The sky was so blue that there wasn't a trace of a light, floating cloud, and it was as clear as a piece of jade covering the top of his head. Looking far away, behind the row of low houses covered with leaves of tropical plants, the tree trunks could still be clearly distinguished, and small birds flew chirping out of the nest forest. Uncle Changchun walked onto the wooden bridge, took a refreshing long breath, and immediately felt infinitely comfortable in his chest, with a natural shallow smile floating on the corner of his mouth. However, when he saw the muddy, yellow-turbid floodwaters under the bridge, and the large-scale rice shop on the other side of the wooden bridge, that huge chimney rising above the roof, lying quietly and silently like a deserted pagoda in a deep mountain, with a few small birds standing at the chimney opening, and never spitting out round and curling black smoke again, a sudden pain struck Uncle Changchun's heart, as if he had been bitten by a poisonous snake, his eyebrows tightly locked, and a dark cloud of sorrow covered his face.</p>
<p>("It's flood season again!") A faint breath escaped from his mouth, and his head swayed like a willow in the wind, sighing.</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago, Uncle Changchun thought in his heart that all of Siam, this "Fan Bang," was made of gold and that if he could go to the "Fan Bang" to be a "Fan Ke," then he could arbitrarily fulfill his desires and put gold into his pockets. Therefore, he bravely left his home, boarded a red-headed boat, drifted in the sea for more than two months, and endured all kinds of hardships before arriving in Siam. But, where in Siam was the gold that Uncle Changchun had imagined in his mind, everywhere and anywhere? When he stepped onto the shore of Siam, he finally shattered the idea of picking up gold in disappointment. However, due to Uncle Changchun's hard work and the smoothness of his business over the years, he was also able to start a family and establish a business, opening a large-scale rice shop in "Ten Thousand Faces," which made people envy him, praise him for his ability, and congratulate him on getting rich.</p>
<p>Uncle Changchun stood on the wooden bridge, staring at the huge chimney in a daze, thinking of the past years when the rice shop's business was booming. Whether it was day or night, this chimney, towering into the clouds, continuously spewed out wisps of curling black smoke, and the sound of the machines grinding was as musical and rhythmic as it was pleasing! Every year when the flood season arrived, after the millet spikes were cut in the mountains, they were transported along the tributaries of the Chao Phraya River in strings of boats to his rice shop in "Ten Thousand Faces." ("Seating Mountain" (in Siam, people generally call their boss "(Seating Mountain)")) thanks to your luck, the harvest this year is so good! The millet grains are so plump! Haha..." The local natives with red lips and black teeth, chewing betel leaves, said with smiling faces. Then, the workers were busy transporting the golden millet grains to the machine room to husk out the bright white rice.</p>
<p>But in recent years, because of the depression in the rubber industry in Singapore, workers were dismissed one after another, and the rubber factories were shut down. This caused Uncle Changchun to lose the market for selling white rice. At the same time, he could not find a way out elsewhere, and the same industry competed fiercely with each other. Under these various pressures, he declared bankruptcy.</p>
<p>When Uncle Changchun saw the yellow-turbid floodwaters under the bridge, and the huge chimney towering silently into the clouds, Uncle Changchun thought of the glory of a few years ago, and his ears still faintly retained the words of those red-lipped natives, saying with smiling faces... "Thanks to Seating Mountain," he felt as much pain and sadness in his heart as if he had been bitten by a poisonous snake!</p>
<h3>Rural Farm Scenery</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The new grain has come to the threshing ground. I pushed open the window of my bedroom and looked out over the fields. Every farmyard was piled high with golden ears of grain, so heavy with yield. In the summer, it hadn't rained for more than two months. The farmers sighed and pumped water desperately, almost abandoning hope for the year's harvest. But unexpectedly, they reaped a surprising harvest. Many waxy yellow faces broke into rare smiles—smiles from the depths of their hearts.</p>
<p>As soon as the sun peeked over the eastern horizon, the farmers had finished their breakfast and moved the threshing bed to the farmyard to begin their work.</p>
<p>Curious, I slipped out the door and stood at the edge of the yard, watching.</p>
<p>The dew of the previous night evaporated in the sunlight, creating a misty vapor from the rice stalks, mingling with their exhaled breath in the cold wind. The old father, whose age we could no longer guess from his appearance, bravely used straw to fasten his tattered cotton-padded jacket. His two legs, like iron pillars, braced against the back of the threshing bed. He took each bundle of grain-laden rice stalks from his son's hand, raised them above his head, bent over, and forcefully threw them onto the threshing bed. After two or three throws, the grains from the rice stalks were scattered thickly on the threshing bed.</p>
<p>He casually tossed the remaining stalks into a corner of the yard. After the work was done, they would stack these stalks into a pile of firewood for fuel; some would also transport them by small boat to the city to sell for a meager profit, while they themselves would search for branches and fallen leaves nearby to cook their meals.</p>
<p>In another corner of the yard, three bamboo poles used for drying clothes were crossed, like three rifles crossed during a break in a military formation. A rice sieve was suspended from the intersection point by hemp rope. The mother held the edges of the rice sieve with both hands, her legs standing one in front of the other. The children carried the new grain from under the threshing bed to the rice sieve, and she vigorously shook the sieve. The grains fell through the sieve's holes into the prepared measuring basket below (a container for storing rice), while the rice husks remained in the sieve. In this way, they stored the new grain in their rice storage pit, to be sold off when rice prices rose in the new year.</p>
<p>However, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities in recent years, the farmers' rice storage pits had not seen rice husks for three years. When the new grain came to the threshing ground, it was sometimes not enough to pay the rent. Even in better years, many creditors forced them to sell the new grain at the lowest possible price—this was the manipulative tactic of rice merchants and large landlords. Rice prices were always lowest at the end of the year, and after the new year, they would raise the prices, reaping great profits from the rice they had hoarded. And those exploited farmers would then have to buy back the white rice they had toiled to produce the previous year at high prices.</p>
<p>Although this year had an extraordinary drought, the harvest was unexpectedly good. A scene of rural family joy unfolded on the nearby farms: the strong worked, the old basked in the sun, and even the children were constantly doing some small chores. Sparrows walked with short steps in the corner of the yard, pecking at rice grains, seeming to rejoice that they could spend a comfortable winter this year.</p>
<p>At noon, most of the work was completed. The farmers wiped the sweat from their foreheads with their sleeves and squatted on the yard to eat lunch. At this time, they began to notice me standing at the edge of the yard. The farmers were quite amiable. Because we often met, they especially poured me a cup of tea to greet me, so I joined their joyful group and chatted.</p>
<p>"The harvest is good this year!" I started the conversation.</p>
<p>"Thanks to the blessings of Heaven!" the old father said, his mouth full of food. "Pumping water day and night for more than two months... if the harvest had been like previous years, no one would be farming anymore..."</p>
<p>"In the end, it's still good for the granaries of the landlords. When the harvest is good, the rice price goes up, and we'll probably have to eat expensive rice again next year!" the mother interjected, and the old woman became worried again.</p>
<p>"Farmers really suffer!" the old father sighed as well. "Speaking of this year's good harvest, what about the rent we owed from previous years? We even sold an ox. If we have three more good harvests like this, I'm afraid we still won't be able to pay off a lifetime of debt!"</p>
<p>"What's the use of talking about our bitter fate!" the old grandmother mumbled. "Since I came over, the rice storage pit was always filled with rice. After paying the rent, we could eat and use it for a year, and still have more than two rolls (fifty yuan per roll) of silver dollars left over. Now this old bones has to suffer!"</p>
<p>The children held their rice bowls and chased sparrows in the corner of the yard. Did these innocent children know that they would continue their father's fate? The debt that could not be paid off in a lifetime was about to weigh on the shoulders of this generation of farmers!</p>
<h3>On the Road to Yangjiazhai</h3>
<p>— Youqi</p>
<p>The warp and weft of the roads intersect to form a complex pattern.</p>
<p>Indeed, that model is a net, netting the entire metropolis, netting the houses of varying heights, and also netting the different races of humanity.</p>
<p>Do you know? The differences are not only in the races of people. Differences in language, customs, and environment often make people different from each other, and often transform a person's temperament.</p>
<p>Recently, perhaps because there have been too many sad tunes, I think, whenever I walk to the end of the Jin Shenfu Road, no, or even when I just think about it, I can't help but feel a stir in my heart. Following that, I can't help but think, "This little bird, she has flown far away!"</p>
<p>So, my heart stirs up a more intense ruckus, doesn't it? "(A corner of the world leaves a faint mark, hearts connected in two places are truly earnest)." These parting words, you truly guessed them, they are writing the true image of my current state!</p>
<p>Originally, everyone was young, so there was no need to put on a face of moralism, because youth is a lovely flower, it is worthy of cherishing, of caring for. Although it grows thorns that can prick people's hands, shedding bright red blood, precisely because of this, it has even more endearing value.</p>
<p>Days, I don't know why they have to run so fast. It has been more than two months since she flew to the somber ancient country. Of course, that ancient country has its own special charm... golden yellow sand, low courtyard walls, neat willow banks, vast wheat fields, and scattered fruit trees... everything would make her happy. She was willing to approach them and become partners with them.</p>
<p>It is said that human imagination cannot always fully come true. Sometimes, it is bound to be shattered by reality. How could she have imagined it? She returned so soon, back to this bustling and detested metropolis.</p>
<p>In order to maintain her original opinions, she temporarily resided in the outer garden of the city.</p>
<p>One sunny afternoon, carrying a special mood, I left the dense net of the metropolis and stepped onto the rural road.</p>
<p>In the countryside, there is a different kind of sentiment. The road is a narrow strip, and the houses can be said to be genuinely domestically produced. Indeed, the scenery of the south is different. The already withered wilderness still holds a dormant life force. The early winter wind, although sharp,</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>But it is very mild, and the temperature of the sun seems to be a little closer. People, also change their appearance, the simple and honest expression will make you suspect that you are in another world.</p>
<p>As always, she was still so happy, as if the good and evil of society had nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>"Do you feel good here?" She smiled, "That's right, coming here, you should also appreciate our great road." That attitude was the same as a little bird.</p>
<p>Slowly walking on the road of Yangjiazhai, many eyes were fixed on us.</p>
<p>Yangjiazhai, a small town, has two hundred households. A stone-paved road runs through the center of the entire town. The houses on both sides are so low that you can almost touch the roof with a hand. Naturally, it does not dare to be mentioned in the same breath as Europeanized grand hotels, but in its interior, it also contains thousands of things, from candies and food to teahouses and taverns. It can be said that all kinds of things are available and complete.</p>
<p>- Look, this is a miniature of Nanjing Road! Do you believe it? That candy store is Laoda Fang, that incense shop is the Renshen Hao of Hongmiao Fang, right? She always thinks of ways to make people laugh.</p>
<p>- It looks even better in the morning, with all kinds of vegetables, fish and meat, like a small vegetable market. Her mouth never stops, pointing and saying this and that.</p>
<p>At the eastern and western entrances, wooden barriers have been built. Needless to say, the purpose is naturally to protect the safety of the town. The fact that this form from many years ago can be found on the outskirts of the metropolis can be said to be a miracle, right?</p>
<p>The winter days are short. In the blink of an eye, the sun is setting again. On the way home, we are buffeted by the evening wind, watching the withered yellow fields. People who have lived in the metropolis for a long time will feel a different kind of mood.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of Movies (3)</h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(3) Edison's Dream of Talking Pictures</p>
<p>However, the research on motion pictures by the great inventor Thomas A. Edison was not considered his main endeavor. He merely treated it as a trivial matter, thinking that with a little effort, a camera capable of continuous photography could be easily created. At that time, he was dedicated to researching electric lights. He believed that electric lights were beneficial tools for mankind. He didn't realize that when he noted the possibility of motion pictures, he was already benefiting humanity.</p>
<p>But things were even stranger than this. When Edison noticed motion pictures in 1886, his original intention was to create "Talking Pictures." Because at that time, he had already invented the phonograph, he wanted to attach a camera to the phonograph to simultaneously display the shapes and sounds of a person speaking or singing. He thought that such a thing would be very interesting. He didn't know that what he wanted to invent was actually the "talkie" of today. But somehow, he treated the phonograph and movies as two separate things until thirty years later, when he combined these two things to create the modern talkie.</p>
<p>Most likely, older people can still remember the "kinetoscope" invented by Edison or W. K. L. Dickson (who was Edison's assistant, specifically in charge of the motion picture camera). They can tell you that they put a copper coin into the hole of that clumsy machine, and they could see little people dancing or boxing inside through a peephole. This little peepshow was not taken seriously by anyone, but it was the prototype of today's movies. It was a real motion picture, the pioneer of modern movie enterprises. Soon, the lens boxes of those peepshows were enlarged, placed in individual rooms, and the people watching the peepshows no longer had to squint through a peephole. They ran into the rooms to sit and watch, and what they saw was no longer those little people. What they saw was the same size as real people, moving back and forth on the cloth screen. At that time, very few people invested in this "weird thing," only a dozen or so, but these people have now become wealthy tycoons in the film industry.</p>
<p>When motion pictures were first invented, anything that could move was interesting. People who made movies had not yet thought of using movies to tell stories. It wasn't until 1903 that a man named Edwin S. Porter gathered a group of second-rate actors from theaters, went to New Jersey, borrowed a string of broken-down trains from the road bureau, and made a movie with a story called "The Great Train Robbery." It was a wild comedy, a total of 740 feet long. If you want to know how long or short 740 feet is, just think that modern movies are usually 1,000 feet long per reel, and each movie usually has seven or eight reels, which only lasts for more than an hour on the screen.</p>
<p>After "The Great Train Robbery" came out, it caused a sensation. Motion pictures became a form of entertainment, like drama, that could be enjoyed. Of course, there were many irrationalities in that movie. The timing was inaccurate. There were no close-ups in it. There was no such thing as facial expressions. In short, the robbers were bad guys, and the heroes were good guys, but they were all walking, jumping, running, and moving back and forth incessantly.</p>
<p>At that time, there was no such thing as a film studio. The so-called movies were all shot outdoors. All the backgrounds were natural. The price of a movie script was about 10 to 15 yuan. If a producer was willing to spend 25 yuan, he could get a masterpiece. There were no so-called stars among the actors because the audience couldn't remember the names and faces of the actors. Their salaries ranged from about 25 yuan a week to 50 yuan. The salaries that Hollywood stars now earn were unimaginable at that time. If you knew the salaries that screenwriters earn now, you would definitely feel sorry for the writers of the past. But if you look at what they wrote, you would definitely think that they were overpaid. Benjamin Hampton, in his film history, gave us a sample of an early movie script. Here is what it is...</p>
<p>(A poor but proud young woman, due to the decline of her family and an elderly mother, is unable to make a living and has no choice but to go begging. A man sees her and feels sorry for her and is attracted to her beauty, and proposes to give her money. The woman is angered by his frivolousness and refuses to accept it, and plans to commit suicide. The man deeply regrets his rashness and goes to her house to apologize. He happens to see the woman committing suicide, so he saves her and leaves money for her mother and leaves. The woman wakes up and realizes that the man is sincere in his remorse and gradually develops a feeling of respect and love for him. The ending is that everyone in the play is happily united in one family, etc.).</p>
<p>Just a few words like this could sell a movie script for more than ten yuan, isn't that a very generous reward? But this kind of story was what our elders liked to hear the most. They were moved to tears and joy after watching that movie. They were willing to spend money to watch that kind of thing, which gave the pioneering entrepreneurs a backing, and the film industry flourished. At that time, capitalists who considered themselves farsighted were unwilling to invest in that kind of quick thing. They said that kind of thing was impermanent and would soon disappear. But the audience saw it. They liked to watch it. They crowded to watch it. Therefore, we can say that the film industry, from the beginning, belonged to the audience. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Movie Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Million Dollar Ransom"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Million Dollar Ransom</p>
<p>Da Shanghai</p>
<p>To persuade the threatening and fraudulent bandits to turn over a new leaf, from the conscience is not the first time expressed in American films since "Million Dollar Ransom". This film is just retreading the same ground. However, the screenwriter who adapted the novel once again clarifies this theme in this film. His efforts to preach for the current social system cannot but show his painstaking efforts. In fact. Such artists, in addition to performing the task of preaching idealistically, have no way to cover up the chaos and unrest of the social order.</p>
<p>However, the screenwriter's lying ability is not very clever. For example, the main key to the plot is that the rich young man wants the great thief to kidnap himself and rewards the great thief with 20,000 yuan. In any case, it cannot be believed that this is a true expression. Since this point is so weak, the subsequent plot will naturally be incoherent.</p>
<p>In addition, all aspects show the vulgarity of the work. Regardless of the stylized scenery, regardless of the moving songs in the ballroom, regardless of the tranquility and natural beauty in the countryside, it still fails to achieve overall success.</p>
<p>As for personal acting skills, there is nothing to mention.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>After Watching "The Big Road"</h3>
<p>— Mao Di</p>
<p>What the directors of "The Big Road" gave us is still their consistent poetic style, anti-imperialist, and surreal.</p>
<p>Road construction workers will shoulder such a major responsibility for saving the nation and the country, and the wandering women and girls in the restaurant will be so alert and brave. No one dares to believe that this is a fact of the current society, as the author himself said... (In terms of consciousness, there may be some ideals!)</p>
<p>However, grabbing road construction workers as the protagonists of the story is not an old-fashioned theme, and the directors skillfully depict it as a relaxed, beautiful, and grand picture. The clear and concise mood makes the audience feel very interested and moved by it, such as when the road workers are tortured, when Jin Yan cuts the rope with scissors underground, this is so tense! Also, how pleasant it is to compete for a cup of tea in a small restaurant and force Li Lili to sing a new Fengyang song!</p>
<p>In terms of performance, everyone has an equal role to play. He can fully reveal the personality of each individual in every shot, and he created a rare follow shot, which is the close-up of everyone when Shang Guanwu set up a banquet at home.</p>
<p>Star talkie, directed by Zhang Shichuan, with Hu Die and Yan Gongshang in "Orchid in the Valley", will be released soon.</p>
<h3>My Review of "The Big Road"</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yan</p>
<p>After watching "The Big Road" directed by Sun Yu, I feel that the content of this film, in terms of the drama's consciousness; on the current film scene in China, can be said to be a successful work. Because the greatness and tragedy of the plot, as well as the majesty and inspiration of "The Big Road Song", awakened the audience's awareness of national consciousness. The author's surging passion and his upward spirit are truly commendable!</p>
<p>However, now that domestic films tend to be realistic, "The Big Road" seems to be too biased towards ideals and lacks the reality of reality. That is to say... all the characters in "The Big Road" are mostly beautified by the author's passionate ideals, rather than the facts of the current era and current society.</p>
<p>At the same time, the performances in the play, such as Mr. Hu (the deputy) setting up a banquet, concubines offering wine, using money to buy Jin Ge, and then privately torturing Jin Ge and others, imprisoning them in stone rooms like the former princes and ministers' private prisons, as well as Ding Xiang and Jasmine trying to rescue Jin Ge, etc.; are obviously a kind of empty ideal.</p>
<p>Of course, the director's sensitivity, the beauty of the shots, and the progress of the actors' expressions, such as Li Lili, are all satisfying.</p>
<h3>Yihua Gossip</h3>
<p>Ying Yunwei's directing work after rejoining Yihua will begin. The name of the play is "Hero of the Times", which is a full dialogue talkie.</p>
<p>Hu Rui's new work "Elegy of Life" has been fully completed, and Li Minghui, Wang Yin, Hu Ping, Wang Naijian, Qin Tong, etc., have all achieved extremely beautiful results.</p>
<p>The second talkie of Yihua Company, directed by Dan Du, starring Li Minghui and Yuan Congmei, "The Eve of the Wedding", is now two-thirds completed. At the same time, "The Fugitive", directed by Yue Feng, starring Yuan Meiyun and Wang Yin, will also be completed by the end of January.</p>
<p>Three songs are also inserted in "The Fugitive", one is the "Escape" song sung by Wang Yin and others, and the other two are sung by Yuan Meiyun and Ye Juanjuan respectively.</p>
<p>Shi Dongshan's new work "The Beginning of Man" is about to start filming, and Bu Wancang's "Triumphal Song" will also begin.</p>
<p>Zheng Yingshi's new work "Sleepless City" after "Flying Flower Village" has been written and will be sent to Beijing for inspection soon. It is a full dialogue talkie.</p>
<p>The Mandarin training class attached to Yihua Company has made great progress recently. At the same time, the Yihua authorities are also planning to establish a music class to cultivate singing talents for talkies.</p>
<p>Qiu Yiwei has officially joined Yihua and is in charge of sound recording matters.</p>

<h3>The Policeman Rides the Dragon (White Lies) (5)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>When Taylor Camden heard Joan blame him for avoiding her, he quickly defended himself, "No, no. At least I didn't mean to." Joan smiled again, "You saved my life, why are you treating me like this?" Joan said, hugging one of his arms tightly, and asked him to turn his head to look at the house. He saw a tall man standing on the lawn in front of the house, looking around. Joan said, "That's Assel, coming out to look for me. Let's hide quickly. There is a path in the woods over there that leads to the stone garden. The moonlight is very good tonight, let's go to the stone garden to play." So Taylor helped Joan walk on the uneven path, Joan leaned on him, giggling from time to time. At this time, Taylor Camden no longer thought about going home.</p>
<p>The trial of Dan Oliver's embezzlement of public funds is about to end. After a series of debates in another room, many jurors have returned to the jury box in the courtroom one by one. Everyone waited solemnly and nervously for their speeches. Sitting in the press box was Robert, a reporter for the Express, with one foot already extended outside the table and half of his butt sitting on the stool, ready to run out and call the newspaper office as soon as he heard the verdict. The defendant sat in the defendant's box, holding his head in both hands. His eyes were red and he stared blankly ahead. Sitting in the audience were Taylor Camden, Joan Mitchell, and John Mitchell himself. These people had been attending and testifying every day during the trial. At this time, the judge's gavel came down. The clerk waved to the prisoner, Oliver stood up and listened quietly to the sentence. The leader of the jury coughed, took a piece of paper and read, "As a result of our deliberations, the defendant is indeed guilty of all the charges against him." Oliver's face turned even paler when he heard this. His lips trembled, and he looked like he wanted to cry but had no tears. He suddenly stood up, waved his fist, and shouted dryly, "You have harmed me so much! If you hadn't arrested me, my money would have been paid off by now."</p>
<p>The courtroom was in chaos immediately. A bailiff walked up to Oliver and told him not to shout. Unexpectedly, Oliver suddenly went mad, punched the bailiff down, grabbed a gun from his belt, and aimed it at the crowd. Everyone crowded and tried to escape. Taylor Camden bravely jumped over the railing and rushed to Oliver. There was a loud bang, and Camden fell. Taking advantage of the chaos, Oliver immediately escaped out the door, pointing his gun at the crowd to prevent them from chasing him. Just as Oliver was about to leave, a woman in ragged clothes and with a haggard face suddenly squeezed to the front from the crowd, stretched out her hands, and begged Oliver not to fire. Joan only glanced at her, but her face had been deeply imprinted in her mind. In an instant, the crowd had surrounded the woman, and Joan also squeezed hard from the crowd to go to Taylor Camden's side and quickly tried to carry him to the hospital.</p>
<p>The days after Taylor Camden was injured were the most difficult days for Joan Mitchell. She ran to the hospital every day to see him. His life was already in great danger, hanging by a thread. Joan was also waiting for news at home at all times. When the phone rang, she was so frightened that she didn't dare to answer it. Later, the condition improved and he gradually recovered. Joan went to the hospital every day to talk to him. The degree of love between them seemed to have exceeded the level of friendship. But one thing that made Joan feel uneasy was that Camden, after being shot by Oliver, expressed sympathy for the murderer. He said, "Oliver is not a bad person. When the news came out, he tried his best to repay the embezzled funds." Joan said, "Publishing the news is the duty of the newspaper." Before she left, she deliberately angered him, "I'm going to have tea with Assel." (To be continued)</p>

The grand occasion is expected to be the same as in the past. Regarding the 1935 models of cars, the mechanism is roughly the same as the 1934 models. There is not much difference. However, there have been major improvements in the body style. According to the New York news on the 4th, the general situation of the products exhibited at this auto show is as follows.</p>
<p>Ford cars will have significant differences. All new Ford brand cars will soon be exhibited in major cities across the United States. Recently, Henry Ford declared that he expects to sell 1,000,000 Ford cars in 1935. However, many people who have seen the preview of the new car say that this estimate is still very conservative. The implication is that the sales volume will be more than this. And it is expected that the new Ford will not only be a strong enemy of various low-priced cars, but also all high-priced cars will be affected by the competition. Ford Motor Company plans to spend 415,000,000 US dollars as the cost of the annual production plan.</p>
<p>According to unofficial reports, the 1935 Ford V8 engine will have 100 horsepower. The brake test rate of the 1934 engine is only 85 horsepower. The 1933 V9 has 80 horsepower. Because of the increase in horsepower, the new car engine can obtain equal mechanical recovery action during acceleration and maximum speed. Another improvement of the new Ford is the increase in the power of the braking machine. It is said that the braking part of the 1935 new car has increased by 50%.</p>
<p>The shape of the new Ford car has increased a lot compared to the previous style. Although some people have been to their factory and seen the new car, they say that Ford's wheelbase has not increased or changed. And some people say that the new Ford has actually increased. Because of the extension of the engine on the chassis, the foot position in the new Ford car is much wider. Both drivers and passengers feel comfortable. The radiator at the front of the car is slightly thinner than before, and the tail is also smaller. But in general, this new car is no different from what has been seen in the past two years.</p>
<p>Other car manufacturers are very lukewarm about the reform of the front wheel suspension. However, a few companies use it as one of the characteristics of the 1935 new car. So this situation is very different from a year ago. There is certainly more than one reason why everyone is unwilling to change the front wheel suspension. But one thing that has to be noted is that no matter which car, if you want to make such a reform, it is expected to cost more than 20 US dollars. In this way, the cost increases, and the buyer has to pay more. It has an impact on sales. Therefore, some manufacturers do not want to increase the price of their products. So they came up with other methods to replace the front wheel suspension. It is said that the effect is very good, and it can also reduce a lot of car body shocks. And this method is much simpler. According to people in the automotive industry, Chevrolet and Chrysler will no longer use this style of spring in their two 1935 new cars. And other car dealers who manufacture low-priced cars will also abandon this machine. But the change is gradual, so the method is slightly different.</p>
<p>The two types of cars that have special modifications in terms of mechanism are Studebaker and Hudson. The new Studebaker car will use an independent front wheel spring instead of a coil spring. This spring was adopted by Chrysler and General Motors in January last year. The new Studebaker car does not have the old-fashioned pivot called "knee action" in the 1934 car. Instead of the above-mentioned device, the front wheels of the new car will be directly installed under the radiator and connected horizontally to the chassis. It is said that it is much better than the coil spring.</p>
<p>The original intention of the independent front wheel suspension is to increase the comfort of driving and reduce vibration and jumping. In the first few new cars that were launched in 1934, the coil spring material was too soft, so it was slippery when turning, and it was difficult to drive when the car was running too fast. Of course, in order to reduce this shortcoming, the spring can only be slightly harder. But part of the benefits obtained by abolishing the old-fashioned pivot will also be eliminated. One manufacturer wants to use automatic gear shifting on next year's new cars. Hudson's new car will use a vacuum-powered gear shift obtained from the engine. This power is the same as that of the water-wiping and automatic meshing blades that push the car window screens. Hudson will use the term "fingertip management" in its advertisements as a description. Because there is a lever near the driving rudder wheel, the size of a fountain pen, just press it with a fingertip, and the gear will change accordingly. Hudson has exclusive patent rights for this "fingertip management" before April 1, 1935. Lihe still corrects the engine's rotation according to the principle of automatic gear change. They have been using automatic gear shifting for two years.</p>
<p>Chrysler's (airflow) streamlined new car is similar in style to the 1934 Buick. Cadillac's LaSalle new car is also similar to the 1934 model. Walter Schmalbel and other companies' new cars will use all-metal roofs. This is also a new idea in the 1935 model. Because although the previous various cars were said to be made of all steel, the roof was always made of woven fabric to reduce the sound of vibration. Recently, due to advances in manufacturing research, it has been possible to manufacture the roof with metal.</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of the Austin Factory</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Rapid Progress Over Thirty Years</p>
<p>Leading the British Automobile Industry</p>
<p>In 1905, the Austin factory, established in Longbridge Town, London, was merely a small workshop. It occupied an estimated area of two and a half acres, employing 270 workers. The total output of cars in the first year was only 120 vehicles. However, the present is entirely different. This great manufacturer of reliable British automobiles now occupies a total area of 220 acres, with approximately 100 acres actively utilized. The road in front of the factory extends for a mile. Compared to the cramped corner of the past, it is truly incomparable.</p>
<p>To maintain sufficient production, the Austin factory employs approximately 18,000 workers, producing over 60,000 cars annually. In practical terms, the current monthly delivery of various Austin models exceeds the total output of the nine years before 1914 by a significant amount. In terms of the scale and perfection of equipment, the Austin factory truly deserves to be the leader among British automobile manufacturers. All vehicles, from raw materials to the final paint finish, are processed within the single facility at Longbridge Town. This allows for strict enforcement of various quality checks and ensures full cooperation and economic convenience in management.</p>
<p>All forging shops, etc., transform raw materials into the various component parts of the Austin for machining. The total number of production machines specifically used for manufacturing Austin cars reaches 6,000. Compared to twenty years ago, the average value of each tool has tripled, and their total value has exceeded four million pounds to date. In the past two years, the Austin factory has expanded by approximately 330,000 square feet, at a cost of over 100,000 pounds. A recent further expansion added 127,000 square feet, costing 28,000 pounds, for the establishment of a large-scale new body assembly workshop. In two years, the factory has spent over 500,000 pounds on new buildings and machine tools, which can be considered a substantial amount. However, this significant expenditure is not wasteful, as the factory's anticipated results have all been achieved. The current weekly production of over 2,000 cars is clear evidence of its success. In 1922, it took 55 workers to produce one car per week at the factory. Today, it only takes nine workers a week to produce one car. With significant labor savings and a dramatic increase in production, the current selling price of Austin products is actually 50% lower than it was twelve years ago. For example, the 1922 Austin Seven horsepower convertible sold for 225 pounds, while today's model, which is universally acknowledged as much more advanced, sells for only 108 pounds. The difference between the past and present is significant.</p>
<p>If one visits the Austin factory for a tour, the meticulous management, complete equipment, and superior work capabilities will be immediately apparent, and one cannot help but be amazed. The reasons for Austin's excellence and worldwide reputation will also become clear. According to recent reports, new Austin car sales have increased by 72% compared to last year. It is easy to imagine that the 112,000 manufacturing workers directly and indirectly employed by the factory have been extremely busy recently.</p>

<h3>Successful Experiment of German Steam Car</h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>Eight-Cylinder Model Completed</p>
<p>The uses of steam seem to be decreasing day by day. At the same time, steam boilers, steam engines, etc., have been gradually abandoned by modern industrialists. Everyone suspects that in the near future, steam engines may disappear from the industrial world. However, reality often deviates from ideals. Due to the global economic panic and the declining production of gasoline, inexpensive and convenient steam engines and other engines are gradually being utilized by industrialists and are showing an upward trend. Recently, German automotive engineers, after numerous experiments, have proven that (steam cars) are inexpensive and highly efficient automobiles, which is a truly astonishing discovery that is sufficient to open a new record in automotive history.</p>
<p>The main driving force of a steam car is the combination of a (steam boiler and a (turbine)). Steam generated by the steam boiler is introduced into the (turbine). Due to the reaction force when the steam rushes out, the blades of the (turbine) are pushed, causing extremely rapid rotation. This then drives the forward gears, propelling the car forward. This system is much simpler than ordinary internal combustion engines, and there is no violent noise during start-up, which is the most valuable aspect. Currently, the German H. Ero has achieved excellent results using U-shaped (turbine) blades, as the reaction force of the steam rushing out can be increased considerably. The eight-cylinder steam car has now been completely manufactured. The cylinders are seventeen inches long and fifteen inches in diameter, with a speed range of ten to two thousand revolutions per minute. It is a fully automatic carburetor with high efficiency. The construction of recent silent aircraft is also similar.</p>
<p>The use of steam to drive vehicles was invented two hundred years before the birth of Jesus. The current steam car is merely an evolution of that. The difference between ordinary internal combustion engines and (turbines) is that the former produces various vibrations and noises during start-up, while the latter</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>is very smooth. The advantages and disadvantages of internal combustion engine cars and steam cars are compared below.</p>
<p>Start-up | Internal Combustion Engine Car | Steam Car</p>
<p>------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Fuel | Gasoline or heavy oil | Coal and water (steam)</p>
<p>Driving Force | Engine | Steam boiler and (turbine)</p>
<p>Braking | Quick | Slightly delayed</p>
<p>Driving | Severe vibration and noise | Very little vibration and no noise</p>
<p>Speed | Cannot be too high | Can be very high</p>
<p>Internal Organization | Very complex | Very simple</p>
<p>Price per Mile | Expensive | Cheap</p>
<p>From the comparison above, although the braking of steam cars is slower than that of internal combustion engines, it has many advantages that internal combustion engines cannot match. In particular, its low operating cost makes it highly suitable for the needs of countries currently experiencing economic decline. We can predict that in the near future, steam cars will fill the automobile market.</p>
<h3>The Current State of Charcoal Cars in Hunan Province (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yuqing</p>
<p>A Conversation Between Xia Zhengkun and Engineer Xiang De</p>
<p>(6) Asked what the maximum speed per hour of a charcoal car is on a level surface (i.e., 0% grade). When driving it myself the other day, I felt that the speed could not be arbitrarily increased after reaching a certain point. The only way to increase it was to use the momentum from downhill. Answered that this is related to the road surface. On a gravel road in Hunan, it can reach 35 miles per hour in clear weather. When driving on Jindi Road in Shanghai, it reached 45 miles per hour.</p>
<p>(7) Asked that on the return trip the other day, still using car number 54, carrying about ten passengers with little luggage, in heavy rain, the car struggled to climb a 5% or 4% grade even when using second gear. Is there a remedy? Answered that if only the uphill capability of the car needs to be increased, the gear ratio of the rear axle can be increased as mentioned in item 5. If it is desired to increase the horsepower of the car's engine, there are three methods: (1) increase the compression pressure in the cylinder; (2) increase the cylinder diameter; (3) install a supercharger.</p>
<p>(8) Asked, regarding car number 54, under what conditions of grade and grade length can third gear still be used to drive over a hill at a speed of 5 to 10 miles per hour. Answered that there is no precise test report on this. Regarding the number 54 coal car, when driving from Xia Sheshi to Changsha in clear weather, except for Wulipo (about 8% grade, nine li from Xiangtan Station), second gear was used. All other grades were managed using only third gear, without using any gasoline.</p>
<p>(9) Asked approximately how many pounds a coal car is heavier than a gasoline car under the same conditions, and how much the charcoal weighs. Answered that this is related to the structure of the coal gas generator. If only lightness is desired, a 1/16-inch steel plate can be used to make a generator with a diameter of 16 inches and a height of 14 inches, which can also drive the car. Its total weight is only 60 pounds, but it can only travel ten li before needing to add charcoal and is easily damaged. It can only be used for testing. Regarding the Xuanzi number 54 coal gas car, it weighs approximately 300 pounds, with the charcoal weighing approximately 50 pounds.</p>
<p>(10) Asked whether a coal car can be overloaded. Answered that it can be slightly overloaded, but the exact figure has not been tested. In general, all internal combustion engines cannot be overloaded too much.</p>
<p>(11) Asked how much money a coal car saves under the same environment and conditions. Please describe this in detail based on the results of actual field tests. Answered that the Xuanzi number 53 is a gasoline car, and number 54 is a coal car. The license plate numbers, tonnage, and age of the two cars are the same. The routes they travel are also the same. Based on the statistical comparison of the performance of the two cars over the past two months (i.e., January and February), the coal car saves approximately 17.7 yuan for every thousand li (each li is 180 zhang according to the Ministry of Works) traveled compared to the gasoline car.</p>
<p>(12) Asked what aspects are being focused on in the improvement of coal cars. Answered that the points being paid attention to for the time being are three: (1) increasing the horsepower of the engine; (2) reducing the need for cleaning after long-term operation; (3) making the cleaning work easier.</p>
<p>(13) Asked that the Changheng section of the road is not very flat, why are coal cars only seen on that section and not used on other routes. Answered that the Hunan Provincial Government has designated the Changheng section as a trial route for coal cars, so it has not yet been extended to other routes.</p>
<p>(14) Asked how much the Hunan Province has spent on coal gas car testing, employee salaries, purchases, and other expenses. Answered that I am only responsible for the technical aspects of the coal gas car problem. I am not aware of the details regarding the economic aspects, but the expenses are not very high. If employees are included, there were only two assistants during the testing in previous years. The purchases were also not very extensive, including only one gas analyzer, one solid fuel analyzer, and one pyrometer.</p>
<p>(15) Asked how many coal gas generator manufacturers there are in China, where they are located, how many places coal gas cars are used, and their regions. Answered that there are currently only two coal gas generator manufacturers in China: the China Coal Gas Car Manufacturing Company in Shanghai and the China Coal Gas Engine Manufacturing Plant in Hankou. Coal gas cars have been seen in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Yunnan, Anhui, and other places, but the numbers vary. Last year, the two companies sold a total of approximately 100 sets of coal gas generators.</p>
<p>(16) Please teach me your opinion on coal gas cars. Answered that coal gas cars are indeed the only economical means of transportation in our country. Based on the results of the tests, every ten pounds of charcoal can offset the consumption of one gallon of gasoline in a gasoline car or five pounds of diesel in a diesel car. It is necessary to actively adopt them for national defense and national economic reasons. Although its structure is not yet perfect, from the standpoint of us technicians, we should strive to improve it, and not like merchants buying goods, discard it when they are not satisfied with the goods. In terms of technology, in addition to improving the materials used for construction and application, such as using refractory steel plates for the generator, the only important point is to increase the horsepower of the engine. The so-called coal gas cars are based on the use of gasoline as fuel. Although we can勉强 (miǎnqiǎng - force) change to coal gas, there are still many inconsistencies. Therefore, I believe that if we want to improve coal gas cars, the research work in the future will not be on the generator but on the engine. The compression pressure, ignition timing, cylinder diameter, valve diameter, gas duct speed, and valve opening time of an engine using coal gas are all different from those using gasoline. If we can build a special engine suitable for coal gas and install it on an ordinary gasoline car, its effect will undoubtedly be better than using the original gasoline engine. Also, scholars in the country have proposed compressing coal gas into cylinders and carrying them on the car for use, which is also a good method. However, the composition of the coal gas used should be different from what is currently used. The coal gas currently used contains more than 50% nitrogen, which is a non-combustible substance. If it is compressed together, it is not very economical. However, both of these research projects are relatively large. Hunan's financial resources are limited and it is not easy to proceed at present. I have also heard that some people in the country oppose coal gas cars and the use of charcoal as fuel, saying that our country's forests are limited and will not be able to withstand deforestation. This point seems to be unfounded. Demand can stimulate production. If the sales volume of charcoal increases, it will not only not damage the forests, but it can also promote the cultivation of forests in rural areas. Furthermore, if charcoal is not used as fuel, then coal should be used. Regardless of the difficulties that may arise when using coal, which are even more numerous and difficult to solve than using charcoal, even in terms of the amount of supply, although the reserves of coal and oil are rich, they are limited. Eventually, they will be exhausted. Charcoal, on the other hand, can be produced for as long as the sun exists.</p>
<h3>New Materials for Building Automobile Roads</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>North American road construction engineer Mr. Du Kai'er wrote an article in the New York Times discussing road construction for automobile driving. He said that in the past twelve years, the United States has spent $15,000,000,000 to build automobile highways that crisscross the country. However, in terms of today's widespread use of automobiles, the existing automobile roads are only one-tenth of what is needed. Nine-tenths still need to be built. However, the funds being planned by the US government for automobile road construction today are $400,000,000, which is obviously insufficient. To find a way to remedy this, the only option is to improve road construction engineering and adopt economical and appropriate raw materials for application.</p>
<p>The construction of automobile roads requires solid raw materials and a road surface that is suitable for ideal automobile roads, smooth, dust-free, waterproof, strong, and economical. All of these aspects must be considered and decided one by one. Today's automobile road construction still uses raw materials from the past. Road construction has only been improved since the historical advent of horse-drawn carriages. In the past, there was no need to pay attention to roads because there were no vehicles traveling on them. The discovery of horse-drawn carriages created a demand for a solid roadbed, marking the beginning of the development of roads. However, the weight and speed of horse-drawn carriages are far less than those of automobiles, so road construction does not need to be as solid as it is today. Automobiles weigh several times more than horse-drawn carriages, and their speed is also far greater. The roads built in the past are not suitable for today, which is very clear. Therefore, the raw materials used for road construction in the past are also not very suitable for today's road construction. So, when discussing the construction of automobile roads today, new construction materials are needed.</p>
<p>Cement roads are certainly outstanding among roads. The engineering department of Pittsburgh University researches road engineering and uses a special type of cement as a raw material for road construction. Several places in Pittsburgh are almost entirely built of cement. However, in general road construction, the middle is necessarily thicker than the two sides, while in cement roads, the thickness of the two sides must be higher than the middle, which is an imbalance. Moreover, cement is too solid and is not a good road surface. Therefore, few cement roads are being built today. However, cement is very suitable for the roadbed of the lower layer of roads because of its exceptional strength. Today's good roads almost all use cement as the roadbed, which is the most appropriate choice for roads. Because it is solid, even heavy vehicles will not damage it.</p>
<p>Recently, American road construction has made many new discoveries regarding roadbeds. Using loose sand as a roadbed can balance the road and is very economical, but it cannot withstand heavy-duty trucks. Due to this shortcoming, it cannot be considered a good choice. Using crushed stone as a roadbed is very economical but cannot balance the road, so it is also not a good strategy. Some have used carbonaceous materials and cotton cloth, but none are perfect. Therefore, other than mud, only large blocks of stone can achieve the same appropriate results for the roadbed. However, the cost of stone is twice as high as that of cement. The roadbeds of major roads in various countries using wood as a raw material are even more luxurious than stone. Although they have various advantages, they are not widely used because they are not very economical.</p>
<p>Today's most common roads are asphalt roads. However, asphalt roads are good in winter but not very suitable in summer. This is the drawback of asphalt roads. Therefore, road builders in Europe and America have recently been trying to create a mixture of cement, sand, and oil that can solidify into a hard block as a raw material for roads. It is currently being used in several cities. It is estimated to cost 10,000 yuan per mile, which is half the cost of asphalt roads. It is both economical and excellent, and may be the most suitable material for roads today. However, the cement must be from Portugal, and the output is not high enough to be popularized. Hopefully, there will be a large output in the future to allow for widespread application.</p>
<p>Germany is the best in Europe for road construction. The surface layer of its roads has a height of four inches and is very strong. Asphalt has also been gradually eliminated and replaced with other raw materials. Cement raw materials are widely used. As for the Netherlands, some roads are built from rubber, as the Netherlands produces many oak trees. Rubber roads have many benefits, although they are very expensive, they cannot be damaged. There are also rubber roads in the South Seas Islands. Vehicles traveling on them can avoid various problems. However, the production of oak trees is ultimately limited and insufficient to supply the raw materials for roads worldwide. The road construction industry is now trying to plant more oak trees.</p>
