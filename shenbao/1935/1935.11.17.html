<h3>教育播音</h3>
<p>— 秉</p>
<p>我人行經市街。輒聞收音機所收之各種播音。彈詞申曲。諢語豔歌。往往而是。究其實質。則爲封建思想之縮影。頹靡氣質之表現。商店旣以是爲招徠顧客之具。居家亦以之爲消遣閒暇之資。晨夕浸染漸移默化。收聽者受此敎育。其思想行爲寧不蒙其影響。尤堪注意者。弱齡兒童。靑年學子。方當接受人生經騐之際。而遇此無俟督責之軟性敎育。將令所受於家庭學校之正當敎育。完全抵消。成效莫覩。是豈過慮。實可寒心。仳方競言自由。似播音收音之干係。遠不逮言論出版集會信敎之重大。宜若可以各享自由。不受任何裁制。然自社會之立塲言之。凡事之影響及於羣衆者。卽不能不問其影響之何若。苟或不良。裁制隨之。不得以自由爲口實。一任其爲害於羣。衆此固明瞭易曉之通義。亦現代社會之鐵則也。行政當局於電臺播音。曾有取締之條。報紙刊載播音節目。復嘗有分別瑕瑜。捨瑕取瑜之主張。用意良善。而我人猶嫌其甄別弗嚴限制太寬。祇爲消極之取締。不謀積極之替代。致令封建思想頹靡氣質之游藝歌曲。或則改頭換面。或則保持原形。仍晨夕囂於我人之耳側。爲移風易俗計。更進一步。以期善用此文明利器。實爲當務之要。</p>
<p>本學期中。敎育部在中央廣播電臺爲敎育播音。每日請人作各科之演講。分別觀之。皆切要之常識。合而言之。成整個之系統。限令各地民衆敎育館及中等學校均須置備收音機一具。以收聽是項播音。此屬更進一步之舉。洵爲佳圖。民衆敎育館不第設於城市。鄉鎮間亦多有之。涉足其中者。不乏未識之無之文盲。若輩不能利用文字之工具。遂與人生切要之常識絕綠。俟其受識字敎育而後解其飢渴。則間接迂緩。不若使之收聽播音之直捷。故民衆敎育館苟能重視斯。舉廣招民衆。按時到館聽講。則收效之宏。當不下於開設若干所之識字學校。至於中等學校。本常有請人到校演講之舉。顧講者自由選題。彼此不成系統。今收聽敎育播音。則於各科正課之外。更獲得有系統之補充知識。學校當局果能不以功令爲具文。而領導學生。悉心聽講。則學生知能之賴以進展者。其量當亦不鮮。所冀播音之諸家便易其講辭。不避深入。但務求其淺出。最好不用枯燥嚴正之講義體。而作親切有味之談話體。俾聽者不惟易入於耳。抑且深印於心。其爲民衆敎育館演講者。尤必避免一切專門之學術語。造語遣詞。一以適應未識之無之同胞爲歸。庶幾言不虛發。力非徒勞。更冀商業性質之電臺。仿效斯舉。多定含有正當敎育意味之節目。卽徒供娛樂者。亦必估量其絕不致遺惡影響。始可入選。而封建思想頹靡氣質之游藝歌曲。則排除務須淨盡。夫文明利器。用之不善。皆足濟惡。必如上之所述。方得謂善用此播音收音之無綫電機也。</p>

<h3>腦的發長和運用　（續）</h3>
<p>— 盧子道</p>
<p>四，腦最高中心之發長</p>
<p>我們已經知道神經功用的發生，繋於神經組織的發長。卽如腦，司吾人的思想的中心，亦有一定之發長程序。有如貓大腦皮層上之司動區，前腿部已發長時，頭部及後腿部仍未顯功用。在前腿部旣發達之後，頭部方開始有作用，最後方及後腿部。</p>
<p>我們人腦上皮膚各處皆有許多連絡前後左右方向的織維，此種織維之髓素鞘，亦分期長成，各處有先後不同。有的比較重要，如司手足之動，耳之聽，目之視，鼻之嘆，於是凡司這些功用各區就先發生髓素鞘。反之如聯念，思想，想像等功用，比較更高等者，髓　鞘即發生較晚。</p>
<p>大腦皮層切片後，在顯微鏡下觀察，有髓　鞘的織維所在地，約可分作外中內三層。這　層地方織維之多寡，因年齡之長幼而不同。年齡愈長，織維愈多。普通在十八歲以前，發長最快，以後較緩，但約可長到四十歲。這現象以內外二層爲最顯。在五十歲後方稍見减少，但爲數甚微。</p>
<p>所以吾們以爲二十五歲以後腦不再發長，乃是錯誤觀念。在四十歲前吾人固可學習，固可用腦。即在四十歲後亦可盡量應用，祇運動方面比較上有些退步。故思想方面，在七十歲前，總能够盡量發展；而運動員在四十歲後很雖獲勝。以我們尋常經騐而論，三十至五十，爲壯年時期，社會上立功建業，大多數皆在此時。至七十左右，方呈耳聾眼花的能鍾老陳。所以從幼年到三十歲之間，應當盡量學習，在三十到九十之間，尤當充分發揮其智力，爲社會服務。固然歷史上有許多大人物，其事業成就特別早，如亞力山大在二十一歲即征服希拉，二十五歲即征服波斯。但這些古今中外罕有之天才，不能拿來一概而綸。</p>
<p>五，腦之運用</p>
<p>然而我們的腦雖目初生以至四五十歲，接續生長，倘使不善運用，亦是柱然。我們受家庭敎育，社會敎育，以及學校敎育，時時影響於腦。大家知道腦和利刃一般，不麼不鋒利，所以我們應當時時運用，使充分發展。我們注意德法二國的國民性，法國人常有恃於天才故善於取巧；而德國人不恃天才，人人努力，故苦幹硬幹，結果法國國家出許多天才固無疑，然德國國家科學較發達，國家組織較嚴密，是即其國民善運用其常態腦子所致。俗話有云：「一個計畫亮抵不過十個臭皮匠」，吾人細玩此語，即可知善於努力運用腦子之重要。</p>
<p>那末我們如何邋用腦子呢？運用的方法有二大原則，第一爲養成健全之身體。有健全之身體，而後腦之營養料足，乃產生健全之精神。第二爲依精神經系組織原理而善自鍜鍊。這種銀鍊約可分三方面，一方面爲動官，如技巧手工動作之類，我們總字練零即是其例。又一方面爲感官，如練聽官成音樂家，練視官成圖盡宋書家，練各種感官成文學家者是；再一方面爲聯念，如練習數學，論理學之成爲科學家哲學家者是。學校敎育，固當基於這些原則，以養成完善國民，俾充分利用腦力；即我們個人亦當自己如此勉勵，庶不辜負天賦給我們一立脫半之腦子。</p>

<h3>國曆的好處　（續）</h3>
<p>（十一月八日十日二天對全國民眾講）</p>
<p>中央研究院天文研究所研究員　陳遵嬀</p>
<p>我們現在已經知道，現行國歷是怎樣的組成，現在就可以更進一步，說他們的好處了。他們的好處可以分做四層。</p>
<p>第一　每年的日數」定，就是三百六十五日或三百六十六日。不像舊歷的可以相差到一個月。</p>
<p>第二　每月的大小，雖然沒有一定，但是非常容易記憶，現在請各位把左手拿出來，握成拳頭的形狀，則手背上各指頭的骨節是凸出來的，骨節和骨節的中間是凹下去的，現在我們把凸出來的呌做大月，凹下去的呌做小月。則除姆指不算外，從第二指數起，即得一月大，二月小，三月大，四月小，五月大，六月小，七月大，數到七月，骨節已經數完，我們再恢復到原來的地方，則得八月大，九月小，十月大，十一月小，十二月大。這可不是很容易記憶嗎？不過各位還要知道大月是三十一日，小月是三十日，只有二月是二十八日，閨年則爲二十九日。</p>
<p>第三　就閏年來說。我們已經知道地球繞太陽運行一周所需要的時間呌做一年，他的實在日數是三百六十五日五時四十八分四十六秒。所以我們以三白六十五日爲一年的長度，則每年比地球實在運行所需要的時間還差五時四十八分四十六秒。積了四年相差二十三時十五分四秒差不到是一日，所以每四年多加一日·呌做閏年。但是二十三時十五分四秒，不到一日，就是比一日還少四十四分五十六秒，所以我們每四年多加一日，又比實在地球所需的時間多了四十四分五十六秒。就是平均一年多了十一分十四秒。積至四百年，約差了三日二時五十三分二十秒。所以每一百年間一定要少閏一次，就是一百年或一百年的倍數不閨，即四百年或四百年的倍數仍要加閏。這是現行國歷置閩的方法。但是四百年少閏三次，他的餘數二時五十三分二十秒經三千二百年以上仍有一日的差數，所以三千年間還要少閏一日以補救之，計自現行曆法實行以來，只有四百年，這種差誤，還沒有多大的影響，我們旣然知道閏月的方法，就可以預知那年應該是閏年，那年應該是平年了，他的方法非常的簡單，也是非常容易記憶的，他的方法就是：「將民國紀元的年數，加上一千九百十一，所得的結果，若能够以四除盡的，這年就是閏年，若不能除盡的，就是平年，但是若爲一百的倍數，雖然能够以四除盡，仍是平年；如爲一百的倍數，同時又爲四百的倍數則一年還是閨年。」</p>
<p>各位都知道今年是民國二十四年，就是西曆一千九百卅五年。我們若用西曆年數來記閏年或平年，那是簡單了，就是不必多加上一千九百十一年的手續。我現在舉幾個例來說。（一）今年是民國廿四年把廿四加上一千九百十一得一千九百卅五，用四除他，得四百八十三，還剩下來三個，就是四是除不盡的，所以今年是平年，就是二月是廿八日。（二）明年是民國廿五年，把廿五加上一千九百十一得一千九百三十六，用四除他，得四百八十四，就是四是除得盡的，所以明年是閏年，就是明年二月是二十九日。（三）設求民國一百八十九年是閏年還是平年呢？我們可以把一百八十九加上一千九百十一，得二千一百，以一百除他得二十一，以四百除他得五，還剩一百，旣是爲一百的倍數，不是四百的倍數，所以是平年。（四）設求民國八十九年是閏年還是平年呢？我們把八十九加上一千九百十一，得二千，他是一百的二十倍，同時是四百的五倍，所以他是閏年。</p>
<p>從上面四個例看起來，我們知道現行國曆的置閏方法，只在二月上多加上了一天，並且很簡單的，能够知道那一年是閏年和那一年是平年。</p>
<p>第四　就節氣來說，現在社會上有一種最無理而最有力的反對論調，就是說新曆不講節氣，不便農家之用，這是一種大大的錯誤，二十四節氣，固然是我們中國才有，外國只講春分，秋分，夏至，冬至四點。但是我們現在所用的國曆固然是採用外國的曆法，不過我們要知道這個曆法是以地球環繞太陽運行一周爲標準的，換一句話說，就是以太陽南北進退爲標凖，而二十四節氣的所定法，上面已經說過是按太陽的位置而定的，就是以太陽在黃道上的位置，每隔十五度呌做一個節氣，所以在現行國曆上來說，每月節氣的日期差不多是一定的，因爲現行的月是把一年分做十二月，不是以月亮環繞地球一周所需要的時間爲一個月。所以每個月平均是二個節氣，並且他的日期，也差不多是一定的。各位若不相信，請把民國元年到二十四年以來，二十四節氣的日期。按舊曆和現行的國曆列一個表來看，（表從略）就可以知道那一個曆法，是適宜於節氣的記憶。現在我就春分和冬至來說，在這二十五年裏頭，春分在三月二十一日者凡二十三次，三月二十二日凡兩次。冬至在十二月二十二者凡十八次，十二月二十三日者七次。總之，他們相差只一日或二日。但是按舊曆來說，春分日期，民國元年爲二月三日，二年爲二月十四日，三年爲二十五日，四年爲七日，毫沒有一定的日期。冬至日期則民國元年爲十一月十四日，二年爲二十五，三年爲七日，四年爲十七日，也是沒有一定的日期。這不過是舉春分，冬至來說，其他節氣，也是一樣的。現在請各位預備一支鉛筆，一張白紙，我把明年，就是民國二十五年的節氣日期，念給各位聽。各位可以把他記下來。就是：</p>
<p>小寒一月六日　大寒一月廿一日</p>
<p>立春二月五日　雨水二月二十日</p>
<p>驚蟄三月六日　春分三月廿一日</p>
<p>淸明四月五日　穀雨四月二十日</p>
<p>立夏五月六日　小滿五月廿一日</p>
<p>芒種六月六日　夏至六月廿一日</p>
<p>小暑七月七月　大暑七月廿三日</p>
<p>立秋八月八日　處暑八月廿三日</p>
<p>白露九月八日　秋分九月廿三日</p>
<p>寒露十月八日　霜降十月廿三日</p>
<p>立冬十一月七日　小雪十一月廿二日</p>
<p>大雪十二月七日　冬至十二月廿二日</p>
<p>以上所說的雖然是明年的節氣日期，但是我們可以把他當做永遠的，也未嘗不可。因爲每年節氣日期差不多，都和這個一樣，至多不過比上面所寫的日期早一天，或者晚一天罷了。我們從上面還可以知道，每個月有兩個節氣，上半年一定在六日和二十一日左右，下半年一定在八日和二十三日左右，若按十二中十二節來講，凡是節，上半年一定在五六日左右，下半年一定在七八日左右，凡是中，上半年一定在二十和二十一日左右，下半年一定在二十二和二十三日左右。由上面所說，我們可以知道鄉間農民所反對的理由完全是錯誤的。立法院張心一先生曾經根據上面所說的情形，編成二十四節氣歌，裨益農民不少。大家能够把上面所說的記憶淸楚，不看曆書，也能够知道每個節氣是何年何日了。這就是現行國曆，對於我國民衆所重視的二十四節氣，有特別好處的地方。</p>
<p>上面所說的是就曆法本身上來講，現行的國曆的好處。現在再就社會生活上來講他的好處，就是現行國曆，在國際上，民生上，預算上，農事上，都有莫大的便利，先就國際上的便利來說，我們都知道，中國現在所處的地位，常常受外國政治和經濟的侵略，國際上的交涉，是比他國特別重要。還有國際的貿易，和國際上的往來，都比他國特別繁雜。用統一的年月是要約的信證，亦爲計算時效的標準。我們現行的國曆，就是世界上最通行的曆法，所以在國際上是非常的便利。他知民生上，預算上的便利，那是各位自身所經歷的，可以不必再加以說明，至於晨事上的便利，就是關於節氣日期的確定，上面已經說了很淸楚，也不必再說了。</p>
<p>總之，現行的國曆，就曆法的三個要素——就是年月日——來講，雖然破壞了月的意義，但是其他方面的確比舊曆是簡單整齊，並且方便的多。不過他本身上有許多的缺點，　如月份的長短從二十八天到三十一天都有，每季的日數是不同的，每月的星期是不固定的。在這樣情形之下，就發生種種改勝的問題。但是現在的改曆在天文學的責任並不很大，因爲天文上周期的確定，早已知道的很精細了。現在改曆的問題大多是屬於社會上，風俗上，或宗敎上的關係，所以現行的國曆，雖然有種種的好處，將來或且因爲社會進化的關係，還要加以改革，也未可知。（完）</p>

<p>如果嚴格地仿古照建國大綱來說。目前的中國實在還沒有到頒布憲法的時機。因爲照建國的程序當一省完全底定以後，停止軍政開始訓政，所謂訓政就是要訓講各縣人民自治，故必須到一省全數的縣都達到完全自治，方爲憲政開始時期，要直到全國有過半數省分達至憲政開始時期，然後召集國民大會决定憲法，頒布憲法。目前的中國，那裏去我得到一個全數的縣都已完全自治的省？更何有過半數省分達到完全自洽之可言？實在說起來，當然還是停滯在訓政期間，不過，一方面經過五六年的時間，而訓練人民自治的成績並不顯著，雖測有內憂外患天災人禍的種種原因阻梗着，不能全盤歸咎於國民黨的不努力，但無論如何國民黨總自己覺得對於人民懷着抱歉，因而有一部分人，也想趕快結束訓政免得再事蹉跎。另一方面，國民黨鑒於外患的日迫，國難的日重，而同時又感受到許多黨外的所謂「名流學者」天天在借着國靴的實口來攻擊國民黨，於是也想着提前來實　憲政，希望由此另闢途徑或者可以「集中國力，挽救危亡，」而起草憲法草案，召集國民大會的呼聲，乃漸漸地增高起來。民國二十一年冬，四屆三中全會，旣經議决加緊進行「憲政開始的籌備」，則事隔三年，自當促其實現，以維對於人民的信用。但是，須知道憲法旣不是萬能，又不容草率，故在人民沒有具備（一）解了憲法，（二）遵守憲法，和（三）擁護憲法的能力以前，輕易地頒布一部憲法，不獨無益，或且反足以損害憲法的莊嚴，削弱憲法的效力。而况四屆三中全會的决議，還是注重於「最近期間稍極華行建國大綱所規定之自治工作」，使憲政開始的籌備得以繼續進行，則試間今日的中國，建國大綱所規定的各地方自治工作是否都已完成，憲政開始的機運是否全巳成熟？祇要不肯盲從反國民黨的「名流學者」的人，一定都會回答一個「否」字！所以，凡忠實信仰總理的遺敎，願爲國家打算建立眞正憲政基礎的人，也一定都會異口同聲地承認在目前仍須貫澈訓政精神於未來的政制之中。（未完）</p>

<h3>小男兒</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「這孩子對這些事的知識真豐富呢！他對這些事多麼專心！現在呢郤又多麼苦惱，因為他不愛看書，因此他躺在床上養病的時候，不知怎樣娛樂；幸而童子們可以供給他無數的甲殻蟲和各色石子，我很快活找到了他這一點興趣；這是一點好興趣，也許就是他發跡的起點。假如他一旦成就了一個大　物家，乃得成就一個音樂家，那是　得慶幸我一年來工作的成功」；其時蜀夫人坐在一本書前。造着許多空中的樓閣，正如它　姑娘時一般，（註）只不過那些是為她自己的，而現在呢郤是為別人的，其中有些理想後來居然成為事實，大槪也由於此，—因為仁愛原是一切事業最好的基礎。</p>
<p>（註）見小婦人第十三章</p>
<p>乃德聽到唐恩戰勝困難履險如夷的敘述至饒興味，而小橋則尤欣賞甲殼蟲與蝴蝶等，深深領略他們短短一生中變動無常的歷史，彷彿這又是一種可愛的神仙故事—因為唐恩雖然語言　愊無華，郤已說得動聽，並且想到至少在這裏那小哲學家也可向他學得一些，心裏也十分滿意了。後來他們又敘述捕捉麝鼠的事，—可憐它的皮已經是他實物之一，—娓娓不倦，忽然裴先生自己進來，提醒乃德和小橋說已到了他們散步的時間了。他們於是進出，唐恩看了他們走去，好不羨慕，於是裴伯伯就抱他到客廳裏的蘇乏上去，使他稍得掉換一下環境和空氣。</p>

<h3>怎樣研究自然科學</h3>
<p>— 楊春緑</p>
<p>自然科學研究的對象旣是自然。那末研究自然科學，當然妥到自然界裏去探求。天空中的日月星辰，地面上的山川草木，和氣候的變化，鳥獸的生死，都是我們研究的好資料。只要你常和自然界接近，留心觀察，精密實騐，不難探得自然界的神秘。</p>
<p>譬如你要知道草棉的形態，那末你便該到草棉的田裏去，它的根是怎樣的，莖是怎樣的，葉是怎樣的，花是怎樣的，果實是怎樣的，種子是怎樣的，你都可以看到。這些都知道了之後，那末再進一步觀察它生長的程序，它生長所需要的環境和養料，它怎樣吸收養料，以及它的根莖葉花各部分有些什麼功用。最好你能試種一下從播種起，一直到收穫，都由你一手包辦。你想倘使你這樣的做了一遍，在你親眼觀察，親手實騐的過程中，你可以得到多少確切的活知識，比了躱在四壁圍住的書房裏，讀死文字，看死圖畫，要切實而有用得多了。</p>
<p>在這大自然中研究自然，才是眞正的研究自然。親愛的小朋友們！希望你們即刻到自然界裏去，多找你們不認識的東西，多發現你們不明白的道理。</p>
<h3>鴿子傳達軍令</h3>
<p>— 魏冰心</p>
<p>宋朝時候的名將張浚，保護國九，抵抗外寇，很有功勞。張浚部下的曲端，知兵法，有膽略，也是一員能征慣戰的大將。所以張浚很看重他，特地封　做威武大將軍</p>
<p>當曲端的兵爲駐紮在安徽宣城的時候，有一天，張浚突然前去檢閱。他進了軍營，只見操塲上淺草平鋪，收拾整潔。幾面軍旗，獵獵地飛揚在空中。遠遠地還聽得「鳴都都！鳴都都」！士兵吹軍號的聲音。可是，沒有瞧見大隊兵馬。</p>
<p>張浚一路走去，經過營房，瞥見簷下有五個養著鴿子的籠子，一字兒高高地掛着。「喞咕咕！喞咕咕！」那鴿子在籠子裏叫著。可是，營房裏靜悄悄地，也不見有大隊兵馬。只有幾個守衛的士兵，站在門口。</p>
<p>張浚好生奇怪，便下令點一部兵馬操演技術。曲端得令，立刻開了一個籠子，放一隻鴿子飛出去。不多時，所點的那一部兵馬，整隊開到。軍容嚴肅，戰術純熟。張浚見了滿心歡喜。</p>
<p>等到操演完畢，張浚又點全部兵馬。曲端就開了四個籠子，放四隻鴿子同時飛出去。一會兒，四隊兵馬一齊趕到。個個精神飽滿，人人身體結實，而且，紀律嚴明，動作敏捷。這可見曲端治軍的嚴，士兵操練的勤。</p>
<p>張浚看了，很稱贊鴿子傳達軍令的迅速；又佩服曲端能够訓練鴿子，使擔當傳達軍令的職司。他暗暗地想，曲端委實是將才，他的治軍，不是一般將帥所及得到的。</p>
<h3>兩個小英雄</h3>
<p>— 劉永淸</p>
<p>提起這兩個小英雄，不是別人，就是最近代表北平民義國術團來滬參加全國運動會表演的兩個小國術家。一個叫于蔭棠，今年纔十歲，一個叫張治平，大槪亦祗有十歲左右，兩人都學得一身好武藝，身强力壯，爲一班喜看國術的朋友最注意的兩個人。他們都稱讚地說：「這兩個小孩子，眞不愧爲這次全運會中的小英雄，」小朋友！這個稱呼，你羨慕嗎？倘若羨慕，那末，趕快學習國術起來，待練成了銅筋鐵骨的身體，那時候大家也要叫你一聲小英雄了。常言道：「强國項先强身」，現在國勢如此，再不强身，更待何時？小朋友！努力吧！</p>
<h3>秋天的樹葉</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>秋天，許多小朋友搜尋着各種樹葉子，來開展覽會，『秋葉展覽會」是極有興味的事。也有許多學校的敎室，用着各項秋集來佈置成極有滋味，而極美觀的的圖案。紅的，黃的，綠的……我們趁這機會，就來和小朋友談談秋天的樹　。</p>
<p>小朋友們先覺得奇怪，秋天到了，樹葉怎麼會股落？老實吿訴大家，這是植物的種手段。植物的生長，需要水分，沒有水分，就要枯萎。到冬天水分少，而樹葉是蒸發水分的器官。他要保持水分不讓他蒸發，就不得不犧牲葉子。所以許多植物，一到秋天，葉柄的基部，生出一種特別的細胞層，—落葉層。使細胞壁中間的一層溶解，脫落葉子，把另一部分的維管束的導管封沒，使內外部隔絕，水分就不容易蒸發出去，可以準備過冬。</p>
<p>小朋友們又覺得奇怪，怎麼一到秋末冬初，許多樹葉，變紅變黃？這裏我們先得明白樹葉的綠色是什麼東西？記得我在科學講座中已經吿訴過大家。葉的組織成分中，有一種葉綠粒，粒中有一種綠色的物質叫葉綠素。而這葉綠素又含着兩種顏色的物質，一種是綠色素，一種是黃色素，秋天的時候，氣候漸冷，又漸漸乾燥。舊的葉綠粒破壞以後，新的葉綠粒不能長成的黃色素却並不破壞，於是葉片的顏色就逐漸變黃。至於變紅色的原因，是爲了葉片裏，積貯了糖分，製成一種赤色的花靑紫，於是葉片便現出鮮紅的顏色，像楓葉一樣。</p>
<h3>每天儲蓄一百文</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>小朋友，在你們學校的近旁，可是每天攢聚着不少小販麼？這些小販，所販賣的東西，可是都是些骯髒的低價劣質的精果，和那些沒有成熟，或是已經腐爛的水菓麼？此外，不長還有「白相大世界」，「狸貓換太子」，「天地人」，以及哥而夫球，有小電泡的濟顚相尙等「一個銅板打頭彩」的玩意兒麼？</p>
<p>骯髒而價低質劣的糖果和水菓，食之有害衛生，一個銅板打頭彩，那是要養成兒童的賭博習慣，這些，想來你們的老師，早和你們詳細說過了，所以在這裏，我也不想多說。在這裏，我要說的，是替你們的袋裏，給那些小販們騙去的銅板可惜。</p>
<p>據我自己當小學生時的經騐，一個小學生每天花掉十個銅板，是再也平常不過的”自然，每天花二毛錢的小學生，也未始沒有。現在就以每天花十個銅板作標準，那麼每月就得三千文。每年，至少總也的花十塊錢。在小學裏念六年書，每年十元，那麼，六年中，不就要花到六十元了麼？若是每天把通十個預備買糖果，打頭彩的銅板，儲蓄起來，說不定六年之間，連本帶利，日積月累的，可近一百塊錢了。</p>
<p>一百塊錢，豈不已是一個很可觀之數麼？</p>
<p>以上所說的，是以一個小學生而論。若是你們校要，有三百個同學每年每人花十塊錢，三百個人，就得花三千塊錢了。以六年算，便是三六一萬八千塊。若是儲蓄了起來，六年之後，連本帶利，那數目是够使你嚇一跳的了。</p>
<p>若是把這一個大數目的金錢，捐給學校裏，好好地建設一下，豈不是好？捐給政府，辦一些建設事業，也未始不能不無小補。</p>
<p>小朋友們，每天給小販騙去一百文，似乎不値甚磨。可是每天若都儲蓄起一百文來，其結果，是否還是不値甚麼？</p>
<h3>砍柴歌</h3>

<h3>給阿國小朋友的一封信</h3>
<p>— 嘉定婁唐中心小學四年級生張增良</p>
<p>阿國的小朋友：</p>
<p>我聽得老師說：「意國和你們的爭論，遠因是爲了從前意軍在你們的阿杜華地方，曾失敗過的，所以這一次要來報仇，近因是爲了華爾華爾事件，意國說：「你們先去攻打」，你們說：「意國先來攻打」，但我不知道究竟那一國是先動手？誰先動手就是誰錯。」</p>
<p>現在你們兩國已經開仗，也就是正式戰爭了，意國派了大隊飛機，把你們的台西，阿杜華等地方，炸得非常厲害，你們的小朋友，不幸被可惡的意大利軍，炸死了三十多人，這幾位小朋友眞死得非常痛心呀！我敢代表中華民國的小朋友，向你們弔唁和慰問，幷祝你們不斷的前進！</p>

<h3>白山烏的故事（十）</h3>
<p>— 禧</p>
<p>我欣然說道：「先生，這也許是不錯的，對於我實在是一件很光榮的事情，要是我並不是白鸚鵡的話，那麼你已不幾和我客氣，儘請奚落教好了。一方面我還要靖你將大名吿知我」。</p>
<p>他答：「我是大詩人賈克吐根。先生，我所遊行的地方，着實不少，我曾經過荒凉的區域，挨受過種種的困苦。我曾在路易十六世時代，唱着歌，我也能在共和時代和帝國時代唱着歌。無論喜怒哀樂，祝賀哀輓，我都能從我的心坎深處唱出歌來。我漸漸的老了，但我們在努力地歌唱着，就是你現在所親眼看見的，我正在這裏夢想着一首新詩中的一篇，至少有六頁那麼長，却不道忽地在我額上猛撞了一下。然而我要是能够帮助你的話，我是很願意替你出力的。</p>
<p>我答道：先生，你確是能够帮助我的，因爲我這時正遇到詩歌上的一重困雖，我不敢說我自己是一個詩人，更說不到是像你一樣的大詩人了，」我向他鞠了一躬，又接下去道：「但是大自然給與我一串歌喉，不論在安定的時候，或煩惱的時候，我的喉管裏總還發癢的，委實和你說，我是完全不懂得詩中的韻律。」</p>
<p>賈克吐根答道：「我已忘却了，你也不必把這韻律放在心上。」</p>
<p>我道：「但是我遇到了一件煩惱的事，人家聽了我的聲音，往往是覺得很刺耳」賣克吐根忙道：「就是我也是這樣，不知道是什麼緣故。當我年輕的時候，我的歌聲一發，人家就會呵斥我，但是現在我就不以爲意了。」</p>
<p>我道：「但我總覺得受不了的。此刻請你可能聽我的歌唱，從實指導一初嗎？」</p>
<p>賈克吐根答道：「再好沒有我在這裏靜心地聽着」。</p>
<h3>蟹的生活</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>蟹肥了，菊花黃了，正是持熬賞菊的佳日了！小朋友呀！你可曾想到蟹的生活，是怎麼樣的一回理？姑且趁這個蟹正上市的時候，來和諸位小友們談談。</p>
<p>（一）形體　海邊上的蟹，形體比我們平常市上所見的，略有不同，就是兩隻鉗子，（俗稱鰲）一隻特別大，一隻却很小，腿也是八隻，背複都具有堅硬而光滑的甲殼，因爲它的兩鉗，像我們的手一樣，小的能拿東西，和找尋食物，若要打洞時，就兩鉗並用。這是公蟹（雄蟹）的形體。雌的兩鉗便不同了，小而軟弱，並不打洞，亦不爭鬬，若外面正在　甚事情，必回河內躱避。眼睛很是希奇，頭上長着兩　竿，兩眼生在竿的用上，能伸縮自如，入洞時，先將兩眼縮進，又將八腿鬈起，才可入洞。身殼　色有紅，綠，黃，藍等色。鉗子顏色　殼上尤亮，壳上有許多花紋，有一點點的，有一路路的，異常好看，煮熟了，全身都赤色了。</p>
<p>（二）作窩　海灘上，有一個個的洞，這就是它的家，若進去看的話，裏面有小門房，另有臥房，廚房，堆積食物，在作窩的時候，是趁潮退後，先用大鉗掘沙，然後夾於鉗膀，携至外面拋棄。還有一法，僅用三隻腿兜撮沙土，其餘八腿爬行。</p>
<p>（三）脫衣　它有堅硬的殼，身子長大起來，怎麼　呢？它的換殼子，像我們人換衣服差不多，必須進洞，先脫背後殼子，然後蛻去鉗子及八腿，像人脫帽子，脫鞋襪一樣。股殼完畢後，身子極疲倦，要好幾天不出來，恐仇敵和它爲難，雌蟹換殼公蟹也、不出去，在窩內保護。換殼時吃的食　，已預先存諸洞內，小蟹須時常換殼，且長　極快。</p>
<p>（四）爭鬭　這　蟹的性質最烈，若別的蟹在它自己的門口，馬上就要爭鬭，先將八腿凸起，然漸漸站起來，兩枝眼睛竿縮進去，一個大鉗子伸出來，預備上前爭國，它們的爭關法法子，用鉗子亂夾，鋒利似剪力，若斷了一隻腿，並不要緊，仍可爭鬬。若斷了大鉗，或一只眼睛，或背殼受傷，它一定要逃跑的。</p>

<h3>紗花局勢轉緩　紗市為原棉帶起</h3>
<p>各月跳起二元餘</p>
<p>紗市晨漲午平、局勢轉佳、良以報載日撤警衛兵、於是人心鎭靜、目本埠當局剴切闢謠、市塲空氣和緩、兼之海外棉業狀况步步上升、原棉高昂、致棉紗成本提高、市價固難過跌、本月份買方有準備收貨說、獨漲二元八角云、</p>

<p>花前市開盤、因美棉續漲十五磅音、已穿出一角二分產外、印棉亦漲三羅比外、測其趨勢、前途仍有上漲可能、故美安洋行頻頻購進、各月一致開高盤、跳起六·七·八角、二三盤平平、收盤信誠　進加碼、又見回昂、結果各月比上日收盤價漲五角半至八·九角、午後開盤近月頗挺、因日商又有捆載出口消息而跳起、但拍至遠月、有獲利者吐出轉疲、二三盤仍屬平靜、收盤稍落、結果近月比上午收盤價漲一角、遠跌一角半至二角、查　出大孚　千六百擔、通記二千擔、信誠一千五百擔、達記三千九百擔、泰昌一千七百擔、益昶一千七白擔、潤康二千三百擔、裕大三千八百擔、明德一千八百擔、愼昌一千四百擔、畏和四千五百擔、買進吉豐一千七百擔、大豐二千擔、元一一千九百擔、長豐三千二百擔、同和三千四百擔、信誠　千三百擔、長和三千六百擔、賡豐一千四百担、潤康二千九百祖、永大二千四百担、源興昌三千二百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>小小專著</p>
<h3>道敎研究</h3>
<p>— 雨</p>
<p>道敎是中國唯一的土產宗敎。它在中國流行之久，遠過於佛敎，而其普遍於一般民衆中，也和佛敎不相上下。所以在要考察中國的宗敎演進時，是不應將它置之不論的。</p>
<p>道敎的來源，在舊的傳說中，一般世俗的人是說它起源於老子。而中國的史家，根據歷史事實，則又謂共爲漢末張道陵所創。其實我以爲這兩說都不正確。因爲老子雖在其學說中包含得有萬物均由自然的一種氣，卽某種目不能見，耳不能聞，手不能搏的東西演變而成，以此主張宇宙一切以氣的一元而相通互變的自然哲學，但他之主張反於自然，乃是原始社會的經濟生活之反映與保留，是一種復古的哲學，其中沒有提倡過煉丹脫化的宗敎思想。他是一個中國古代的哲學家，並不是宗敎家。至於張道陵，雖然確是以道敎第一次公開號召，且由於漢末的社會腐敗不堪，一般農民窮苦無所依歸，因而他能糾合衆多的信徒去擁護他，但這也只是適逢其會地迎合了當時人民不滿現狀，要求解脫的心理，所以道敎在那時大爲一般人所歡迎，而形成空前的一種勢力，却並不能說道敎是張道陵所創的宗敎。因爲事實是很明顯的，在那時以前就運貴族階級也早已有這種宗敎的迷信。秦始皇遺人入海求仙求長生不老藥，漢武帝也築露　求仙求食之能長生不老的仙露，就是明澄。</p>
<p>道敎的淵源，其由來是很久的。就其敎義與解脫法看來，它是以中國的五行之說爲根本依據，而五行之說在中國實流行已久。並且這種五行的說法，一方面我認它是原始的野蠻人的自然拜物敎，經過提煉掙化而成的，他方面則是一種原始的自然哲學。因爲自然拜物敎是認萬物皆有精靈，是現實的物體之活的元氣，成爲物體存在與活動的根本要素。五行之說是崇拜着這種精靈元氣的，它不過比原始的拜物敎更進一步，把它們加以關聯的與互變的考察，並說得更神通廣大些，更崇拜得利害些罷了。所以五行說是主張五種元氣之相生相尅，互相變化而成萬物，而在其配合協調適中時亦卽能使宇宙萬物永存。這就是說，萬物之精靈元氣，如五行說所特別標示出來的金，木，水，火，土的元氣，是現實物之存在與其變化的根本，這就和自然拜物敎的思想相符合。可是五行說的五行是金，木，水，火，十，而這些東西又都是物質，因此亦可作爲原素看。由這五行的生尅變化演變爲萬物，亦就是說萬物都由這幾種基本原素演變而成。所以五行說若從另一方面看，也正和古代希臘自然哲學一樣，認宇宙萬物都由幾種原素變化而成，亦卽和巴門尼達主張水，土；恩比多克主張火，氣，水，土；亞納西米尼主張空氣；赫拉克里特主張水爲萬物之原的宇宙哲學是一樣的。甚至這些自然哲學還是古代的唯物論哲學，所以中國的五行說亦包含得有那種原始的唯物論哲學思想於其中。</p>
<p>然而道敎呢？它就是以五行說，卽以這樣的自然哲學的宇宙觀，混合於原始拜物敎的宗敎迷信之中，並把原始的自然拜物敎簡單化了才形成起來的。因爲照道敎的敎義說，它認爲宇宙萬物和人，都是以相同的金，木，水，火，士五原素配合成的，人的肉體就是一小宇宙而與大宇宙相通。這些自然的原素是變化的，它能變化配合成萬物，亦能變化配合成人，所以人是秉這些天地元氣而生存的。不但如此，五行之氣的物質原素，在宇宙中只有循環變化運動，却不會消滅，因此，能獲得這些原素使之配合平衡，則這成形的物體便可以永存，所以它在這裏還包含得有物質的基本原素永遠不滅的觀點，包含得有宇宙的一切都能變化不息，相通相成，永不消滅的觀點在。道敎根據了這樣的自然哲學的宇宙觀來形成它的敎理，所以它的解脫方法便和別的任何宗敎都不相同。它主張從物質的實體上去用工夫，以完成其精靈不滅，卽完成其長生不死，或脫化現存形態的軀殼以達到成仙飛昇的目的，這就是它的煉丹術與飛昇說之由</p>

<p>來。照道敎的修練法講，它主要的是主張人要長生不死，在於聚集天秉的元氣使之凝結不散，這種目的可由煉丹術和衛生術達到。所謂煉丹是有內煉與外煉之別，以內省吐納導引之工，求得組成身體之五行的元氣熊靈活運行，配合適中，永結不散。如此卽令脫離軀殼，而人之完整的元氣或精靈仍可不消失，卽人可以飛昇而長生不死。外丹是採集物質原　，如汞，鉛，茯苓之類，煉成金丹吞食之，以重培元氣。而內丹之修練法，如打坐，吞氣，房中術等等，則都不過是衛生的方法而已。但不管內丹外丹，它都是以物質的元氣之運用與培補爲方法，並不在勝質之外去求解脫方法。它的脫離也是如此，肉體飛昇或軀殼脫化，在道教之認此便爲成仙，都不是單純的什麼靈魂得了解救，而是要修練到了物質的元氣能永久凝結不散，能自由地行其有形無形的變化，自由往來於天上人間甚至大地以內，這才是成了仙，得了解救。</p>
<p>從這樣看來，道敎雖然同樣是宗敎，是無稽的空想和幻想，但它在各種宗敎中乃是以宗教的外衣包蔽着原始的唯物哲學及其宇宙觀於其中的一種宗敎學說。因爲別的宗敎，比如佛敎，其修練方法完全是以苦行的和內心的修養，格去物慾乃至注意行爲的善果爲條作，而其解脫得救則是靈魂的自由與安慰，甚至是來世的與現實的肉體本身完全無關的解脫法，是倫理的和唯心的解脫法。</p>
<p>因爲道敎的解股與佛敎的解脫法相異，是基於兩種宇宙觀的哲學思想之不同，所以它們在中國常相對立鬥爭。自然，以道敎這種幼雅的唯物思想，它和較有精深敎義的唯心的佛敎的宗敎哲學相鬥爭，當然是敵不過的。所以後來如全眞派的王嘉等道敎中人，也不能不漸漸受佛敎甚至儒家的影響，從純粹注重物質的肉體之修練與解脫法，而採取了修德的倫理思想，主張超出欲色界，主張出世等等。但是，如果說到道敎的傳播方面，卽其宗敎思想之普及方面，却也並不亞於佛敎，這在中國的神話和小說裏面，是充分地表現着的。因爲在許多神話和小說裏，不但說着許多的人修練飛昇成了神仙的故事，並且說着許多物類亦能修練成仙的故事，如像所謂白鶴大仙，荷花大仙，狐狸仙，烏龜大仙等等，無奇不有，這都是根據道敎敎理表演出來的。就是爲佛敎宣傳的西遊記罷，如孫猴子，猪八戒，沙和尙等，能以猴猻，猪　，沙魚修練成神，而且本領都很大孫悟空且由於偸食蟠桃得以長生，增長了道法，這都不是佛敎的思想而是道敎的思想，是很明白的。總之，道敎雖是鄙俗，但其敎義並不能說其中絕無深刻的哲學的宇宙觀。我們自然反對那些無稽的空想和幻想，然於其中看取中國文化之寄託於宗敎中的知識的殘片和哲學的思想，它也是很好的林料之一。</p>

<h3>黑人拿破崙</h3>
<p>— 愚</p>
<p>在西印度羣島上有一個三多廟島（海地島），現在是一個名義上獨立的共和國。但是，這個島嶼在過去是法國的領土，島上的居民以黑人為最多，這些墨人之能脫離法國的統治，建立自己的國家，當然是經過了艱苦的鬬爭的。我們要在這里說的被人稱爲黑人拿破崙的茲茨桑·魯布爾居爾，便是在三多廟的獨立揮動中產生出來的人物。</p>
<p>在一七九一年的夏季，三多廟的黑人即開始起來反抗白人的統制和壓迫，唸着迢個反抗運動的發展，使三多廟日益陷入了混亂狀態。這時，被稱為黑人拿破崙的羅茨桑雖是一名奴隸，但他却頗能得一般黑人的尊敬和信仰，他能指揮許多黑人，因之他　然也還有些力量了。可是，這時的他却非常鎭靜，他不管農民的動亂，不管門外的殺聲，只是靜觀着。他的農塲的支配人拜郁此時不在農塲里，留守在農塲里的是其夫人，這位夫人因爲感到了當時的危險，主張馬上遷居，但茲茨桑却勸她安靜，不要恐懼，一切都由他負責主持。後來支配人拜郁　來了，看到他的農塲和別的農塲的情形全、不相同，秩序還是如平常一樣的整然不紊，於是他非常喜歡，拍着茲茨桑的肩背誇耀他的才能。原來茲茨桑有他自己支配下的自衛團，這里的農塲得以無事的，就是全靠他的自衛團的維持。</p>
<p>茲茨桑的自衛團與那時三多廟島一般黑人的自衛團不同，這是很威武，頗有戰鬭力的。那時島上的黑人都對他特別誇獎，說只要他的自衛團一出來，强敵必會不戰而散。在他這自衛團成立了幾個月之後，他便成爲了全島自衛團中的重要人物，並參與島治的機密。他的自衛團的規律很嚴，如不能守規律者即須退團，但既係團員，便須嚴守規律，否則即要受重罰。他的口號是爲「自由與獨立自守」，這在他內心中的解釋當然是要爭得黑人的自由獨獨立，不是去保守白人的權利。</p>
<p>在三多廟還在紛擾的時候，新從法國派來了三個使臣，不承認他的軍隊是三多廟的正式軍隊。這樣，他的自衛團便須解散，共武器便要被奪去。於是，他便决定堅决反抗，他發表了很長的演說。在這中間，他會分析了當時統制內印度乃至整個美洲的歐洲各國白種人間的矛盾，並怎樣利用這個矛盾來爭自己的獨立和自由：他說：「我們的目的只有一個——三多廟歸黑人！」但是，當時會塲中的穩健空氣非常濃厚，使他不能馬上行動起來，結果是推選了兩個代表去和法國代表談判。在這談判中，因爲兩方面的意見發生了尖銳的對立，本有馬上發生變動的可能，但到了一七九二年四月四日，忽然傳來了這樣的消息，說是混血兒及非奴隸的黑人，可有一切皆與白人平等的權利，這當然使得形勢緩和了下去。接若便是法國的革命政府撤換了以前派來的三僩使臣，新來的是羅伯士比爾的親信雅各賓黨員。於是，混血兒都歸順在白人的軍門之下了，黑人也未被輕視。這時茲茨桑又感到了機會快要來到，對於全局的變化特別注意。果然，由於長期的擾亂，不能歸還的農民非常之多，於是又發生了新的動亂；而白人對於黑人亦加以種種虐待，被他們拘捕去的黑人都被殺戳監禁或拷問：黑人當然還在不斷反抗，在此情形下，茲茨榮就有了跟着起來反抗的想念。同時，叛亂的首領布克曼又向他下了這樣一個最後通牒：</p>
<p>「茲茨桑！限你在一週內與我軍合作！如　你和你的軍隊在一週內不來與我們相結合，我們即認你爲敵人，我們所要處以火刑者，首先就是你！」</p>
<p>經過了一番考慮後，茲茨桑毅然决定離開農塲，率領二百名强壯的兵丁去參加反抗運動了。由於他的參加，當然增加了黑人的軍事的反抗力量。結果，法軍大敗，法將加爾波將軍率領數千人逃往北美。同時，在這混亂中，所謂西方極樂島的三多廟也成爲恐怖之窟了。</p>
<p>在這樣的緊張形勢之下，南北美的白種人都感到了大大的不安，他們曾爲此事特別召集會議，一致决議組織白人的聯合戰綫，共同去壓服黑人，呌出了打倒黑人的口號。但是這時歐洲方面因爲法國大革命的爆發和發展，引起了英德和西班牙的聯合于涉，由此給與了殖民地以很大影響，白人的聯盟也就很快地瓦解了，接着來的是反法蘭西革命的聯盟出現。這個在三多廟的反法蘭西聯盟的首要是西班牙。茲茨桑看淸了這點，即决定與西班牙聯合以反抗法蘭西。那時三多廟黑人中的幾僩上層的巨頭也與西班牙聯合，但他們是感激西班牙王室的幫助，受其利用的；茲茨桑則不然，他知道西班牙並不是在眞的幫助黑人反抗法國，而是在利用他們去爭取權利，所以他之聯合西班牙，不是去受其利用，而是去利用西班牙以爭取其自身的獨立和自由。</p>
<p>爲了三多廟的自由與獨立，茲茨桑領導黑人與法兵作英勇的光榮的戰爭，結果是他以奇兵大大敗了法軍，佔領了三多廟島的很多要地，使法人不得不承認黑白人種的平等權利，禁止强迫勞動和買賣人類，廢除奴隸制度。於是，茲茨桑的軍隊也被承認，並得大加整頓，終於成爲了新式的很整齊的隊伍。</p>
<p>得到了法國的承認黑白人種的同等權利後，茲茨桑又看淸了當時形勢的變化，即行捨東西班牙，再與法國合作。但是，依靠西班牙王黨的幾個黑人的上層領袖還要繼續反法，並且向茲茨桑開火。在這個爭鬥中，茲茨桑又堅决領導黑人抗戰，獲得了最後的勝利。後來因英國的干涉，他又與英國交戰，結果與英國訂立了這樣的條約：一，英國供給三多廟島以必要的生活品，衣物，藥品等；二，英國在三多廟任何地方保有駐兵權利，三多廟政府對於英國軍隊應給與可能的便利；三，茲茨桑有保護一切英人之生命財產的義務；四，英國與三多廟保持長期的友好關係。這樣，三多廟雖仍沒有完全獨立，但一般黑人在這裏所受的壓迫比較過去總要好多了。所以，三多廟的黑人非常敬佩茲茨榮，其威風大有極盛時期的拿破崙在法國之概，故稱之爲黑人拿破崙。</p>
<p>三多廟後來因美國勢力在美洲的大犬發展，早已脫離了英人的覊絆而依存在美國之下了。現在，三多廟可說是美國的保護國。不過，就在目前的情况下，只要一提到三多廟的獨立英雄黑人拿破崙茲茨桑，當地白人都還有點心驚膽戰的，雖然這位英雄是早已死了。</p>
<p>訓練與修養</p>
<h3>治事</h3>
<p>— 孟龢</p>
<p>由兩個不同的人來做同一件事，所費的精力和時間也是一樣。相其終局結果却是完全兩樣的，這就是效率不同的綠故。所謂效率，是費力小，成事大。怎麼樣才能達最高的效率？這問題曾經無數科學家爲此而殫精竭慮，故實不容吾人忽視。</p>
<p>奮勇治事固是一件美德，但若不知怎樣處理事務的方法，縱不至徒勞無功，也必成效鮮見而謬誤百出。茲試述有效的治事原則：</p>
<p>一　敏捷</p>
<p>若有淵博的知識和富有審度力的人而不能有更進一步的敏捷的行動，當會坐待時機轉瞬過去，無所成就。所以大也茫茫，人由環境所受的刺激至多，但各人能力不同，應付的方法亦各別。凡善於應付的，必敏於行事者。西班牙王向享利挑戰，享利毅然對他的使者說：「請你的主人注意，在他未踏馬鐙以前吾將高據鞍上矣！」如享利者，可謂行動之敏捷者矣。</p>
<p>行動敏捷之效果，約如下述三者：</p>
<p>一，得心應手若對於外來的刺激，經敏捷的審度之後，卽繼之以敏捷的行動，則無論天大的事體，决不至手足無措，左支右絀了。</p>
<p>二，事不虛發凡能應付迅速者，方能事不虛發。軍事家運謀計畫，常利用所謂「間不容髮」之際，出奇兵以制勝，若不處以敏捷之手腕，勢必坐誤戎機，致遺心腹之患。</p>
<p>三，盡得機會凡行動敏捷的人，隨時隨處逢機會；反之，行動遲鈍的人則時興「機會不我來」之嘆。其實機會之爲物猶如風馳電擊，　　卽浙的。所以</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>機會雖如連珠一樣接續的光臨，但遲鈍麻木的人，必不勝應付，只有行動敏捷的才能盡得機會，而獲應用之妙。。</p>
<p>不過，我們所說的「敏捷」是曾經「審度」而下的「决斷」。也許有的人行動雖然敏捷，但沒有充分的審度，或竟毫不審度，那磨只能稱之爲「魯莽」「操切」，不足以語敏捷了！</p>
<p>不敏捷的原因，常是在沒有剛果的魄力，和堅强的意志，腦海里常盤旋着不必要的顧慮和恐懼，使自己心神飄搖不定，失却了成功的機會。</p>
<p>二　創造</p>
<p>中山先生曾別人類爲三等，一爲不時代和這社會里，自然不能完全不受這時代這社會的影響，但叭能以現時代和現社會作自己立足之基礎，而開擴自己的智慧的，才算是有為的人物。</p>
<p>那一般俯首貼耳於成法的牢籠而莫能自拔的，實使我人爲其一生事業惜，也爲人類社會的要失英才惜。</p>
<p>創造力，雖與天賦的智慧有莫大的關係，但亦有賴於人爲的努力。茲述其要點如后：</p>
<p>一，必多所接觸（Openness　to　impressions）美國（Pennsy-Ivaina）公司經理嘉賽（Cassatt）在公司辦事的時候，他隨時與公司各職員談話詢問，對於傭僕雜役無不以和善的態度與之交接，因是深明公司中各部利弊，以爲改造之張本。在吾國歷史上也常見淸明的州牧長官微服察訪民隱，問政於陌頭老農，以正行政的趨的。</p>
<p>二，求新有一個人，平時留心搜集廣吿，積七百英尺之厚，他就在這些廣吿中取其長，棄　短，再運用自己的新意，繪成廣吿，無不新穎別緻，成著名之廣吿畫師。</p>
<p>三，體會人要能着眼於細小處。我人若有旅行中，自然界中，書籍中，凡所見所　，都繪以深刻的體會，必能增加無數可貴的經騐。</p>
<p>三　集中</p>
<p>愛默生說：「在生活里那一件所謂「智慮」，就是「精神集中」，那一件所謂壤事就是「精神煥散」。</p>
<p>戰爭中，有計謀的長官，要發覺敵人防線中的弱點，於是集中全力，向這弱點進攻。對於事務上也必得有集中的精力，奮其全精力以謀事務之成功。精神集中的人，得到的力量雄大，精神分散的人，得到的力量薄弱，吾人不能不注意焉。</p>
<p>在一時間內，祇能顧及一件較重要的事。威爾遜曾說，他自己祗有一個「專一心志」，就是精神集中的意思。</p>
<p>精神集中的先决條件，先要養成精神集中的習慣。這種習慣是頂容易養成的。只要把分散在四處八方的注意力集中起來，像一塊回鏡在太陽光下把陽光聚攏成一焦點一樣。養成這種習慣，可從下列兩方同時並進。</p>
<p>一，一己心靈的制裁——自制。這是屬於精神方面的。</p>
<p>二，利用計劃辦事的方式，帮助集中精神。你每天要有個行事進程表的規定，按步就班的，在你規定的時間中，集中你的精神，只幹規定的事，一切煩雜之思想，都拒之於你心靈之外，若一事尙未了結，决汪想分你的精力於第二件事情上。</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3>護路隊</h3>
<p>— 嘉</p>
<p>車過平漢路時，無論大小車站，總可見着月台上有許多持槍立正，面對火車的武裝同志，那就是護路隊的兵士。他們恭而且敬的立在那兒，也有一個名目，便是「接車」。</p>
<p>「接車」這項工作，看來不大費力，然而幹過這玩意的人纔曉得牠的酸辣。老於當兵的人，他願意出操，開差，甚至「築公事」（即是築戰壕等），却不高興「接車」。如果拿大站來說，譬如鄭州，保定，長辛店，快車和特別快車，每次停站都要四十分鐘，兵士們在火車進站前使要立在那兒迎接，直等到把車歡送出站了纔得休息。至於慢車和客貨混合車（如七十二次車）那更停留得久，因爲裝貨，卸貨，最少也得躭擱兩點鐘；假如還要讓車，那就有三個鐘頭的勾留了。在這悠長的時間中，眞可站得打磕睡。自然，所謂接車，也不完全是恭而且敬的站在那兒，還可荷着槍在月台上走來走去，但是經過三四點鐘的過程，腿部也要走軟的。</p>
<p>同時接車的次數，每天固定的便有六次，有時多至八九次，其中雖是車的名目因車站的地位不同而有分別，——在黃河北岸，（由新鄕到保定）有「五十二次」和「五十一次」，在南岸（由新鄕到漢口）便沒有這兩次車，而有「六十一次」和「六十二次」，——但每天經過的次數是一樣多的。這六次率中有四次票車，其中有兩次是特別快車或快車（照平漢路的章程，一禮拜內的一，三，五及星期日這四天行快車，二，四，六三天行特別快車）有兩次是慢車，其餘兩次則是最令人討厭的客貨混台車了。迎送四次票車的時間，大約需要四個鐘頭，至於兩次混合車，敢少也要五個錡頭，合計起來，全天接車，即站立的時間，不下九個鐘頭，然而除了「票車，「混合車」之外，還有「加點車」，「煤車」，也得迎接，歡送。像這樣長久的站立，無論腿脚如何强健，也會感覺十分疲乏的。</p>
<p>自然，火車的開來，並非連續不斷的，但正因爲時間有間隔而感釗麻煩。每每送走了一班車，剛掛好槍，掛好彈袋，解下綁腿，預備睡一會兒覺，可是當你還沒合上眼時，又聽得車站上的點聲「鐺，鐺，鐺」的（火車由第一站將開時，第三站便打點預吿，至於自南還是自北開來，這從點聲中可以分辨出），這聲音使你不敢貪睡。再過半點鐘光景，又聽得票房里「咶呀咶」的響，這便是押路籤」，報吿着火車巳從第二站出發了。於是趕快打綁腿，（大都沒有解脫）　子彈，戴軍帽，提起那一枝勞什子似的槍，跑到站台，一字兒擺開，等到火東發出長長的狂呌，如長蛇一樣的撲進「揚旗」（離月台五十碼左右）時，就照例的做那持槍立正的姿勢。如此一次，二次，……整天的時間就在準備接車和正式接車中化去了。</p>
<p>如果是在春秋兩季，那倒不在乎，最多也不過委曲下腰部和腿桿，可是到了夏天，就不免「悲從中來」了：平坦的月台似乎特別容易吸收熱力，牠好像一隻熱鍋，人站在上而就像一塊油煎餅。其實暑天還止較容易熬耐，至於冬天，那史是痛苦難言了。平漢路的位置大半屬於北方，氣候十分寒冷，護路隊的兵士無論在什麼天氣都要上站接車，有時北風凜冽，大雪紛飛，地下的積雪凝成很厚的冰塊，在那露天之下站立一二個鏡頭，全身便會凍得失掉知覺，尤其是夜間吃苦更大，矌野風聲，四境夜色，均足以增加寒意。</p>
<p>不過這是駐在大站的情形，如果是駐防小站，那就輕省得多了，因爲小站停車的次數雖然一樣，但停留的時間很短：票車到站，祇吐出一口大氣，等到換了路籤（火車停站，要山站長發給路籤纔得開行，一站換一站，以免兩車互撞），便可開行，如以時間計算，最多不過四分鐘，就是混合車同煤車開到，因爲小站無貨裝卸，也停留不久，有時即使要讓前後的票車，最多也祇停個把鐘頭。所以能够駐防小站是護路隊的兵士大家所希望的，每天旣不出操，又不上講堂，接車的時間又那麼短，如果不賭錢抽白麵，時間是很難消磨的。同時護路隊以一班爲單位，駐防小站的大都爲一班人，班長雖爲一方的大將，負有管束之責，但究非長官，弟兄們很能自由的。不過這種享福並不長久，最多一月或兩月便要掉換一次，不然權利之爭難免不演成一幕打漁殺家呢。</p>
<p>護路隊的兵士們，除了接車保護旅客安全外，還有防止破壞鐵路，掃淸匪患（就鐵路附近說）的責任。如在「淸平世界，蕩蕩乾坤」倒不要緊，假如一旦土匪蜂起，那工作就加重得多了；白天要加雙崗，夜間不住的巡查車站前後左右，（火車被刦大都常東停站時，不然車跑的那麼快，匪縱有三頭六臂也是沒辦法的）小站　一班人，大站最多三班人，不管怎樣輪流分配，工作之多也是不能鬆氣的。兼之平漢路匪風特盛，尤其是黃河南岸，幾乎三天有兩次匪警·竟卉得鐵路的保護人疲於奔命。所以他們有一句這樣的「格言」：「駐防要駐黃河的北岸」。</p>
<p>但是駐防北岸也不怎樣好玩，如果駐在彰德附近一的產煤區域，還有「押煤車」這項住彈。這兒每天都要裝煤到南方（大抵是漢口），沿途的「煤偷一很多，需要一位武裝同志的彈壓。押煤的警兵整天的端槍實彈，站在敞亮的煤車上，威風固然八面，可是難免不受風吹，雨淋，太陽晒（煤車全是敝的，祗有一節「守車」專供司事住宿。押煤的警兵爲了防止煤偷半路上車，是要站立煤堆上纔能照顧周到的），兼之煤車開得很慢，由彰德到漢口，來回總要六七天，在這樣長的時間中，所受的痛苦也就難於描述了。人們經過平漢路時，只要注意一下開行的煤車，不難見着一個服裝齷齪，滿臉煤灰的灰色人兒，縮頭縮腦的站立煤堆之上，那就是保護煤炭沿途淸吉的鏣師了！</p>
<p>護路隊官兵工作所得的代價是：班長每月十八枚大龍洋（中下士薪餉一律，沒有上士這一階級），上等兵十二元，一等兵十一元，二等兵則爲「二五得一十」。這雖非「月入甚豐，」但每月却可按期關足，因此幹來很覺起勁。</p>
<p>每當關餉期近（月底，或下月一·一號），他們在站台上或票房里常常猜說：「餉車今天可到了，」或是：「餉車也許到達長辛店了。」（餉車大都由北平開出，經過各站次第發放）其實餉車若真的巳由北平出發的話，要不到三點鐘，這消息便可傳到漢口（沿途山電話傳遞，這隊得着消息便傳至那隊），不過餉車　達某站，須點發淸楚後，纔得開到第二站，時間不免有些躭攔，於是弟兄們便有點兒慌了，趕快由電話探向別站的同志：「餉車到了那兒？怎麼還不夾啊？」</p>
<p>待餉銀到手後他們便都瘋狂了，忘記了接車的辛苦，忘記了押煤的疲勞，忘記了炎熱的太陽，忘肥了風雪的冰凍，趁着閑暇。犧牲了睡眠，偷偷摸摸溜進酒館；溜進娼騫，七嘴八舌的，歡天喜地的爭嚷着：</p>
<p>「一斤白干啦！紅燒肚條啦！」</p>
<p>「二姑娘過咱這兒來呀！小×幹嗎不見呀？」</p>
<p>世界翻騰了。一月來由血汗換來的子兒，都塞在酒館老板的袋裏或小脚姑娘（平漢路的土娼大都是小脚）的懷里，於是全身輕飄飄的！</p>
<p>但是，假如不「多承老總們照看啦」，那平漢路上的「土條」（即土娼）又將如何過活呢？</p>
<p>科學叢話</p>
<h3>兩顆大流星</h3>
<p>— 徐雉</p>
<p>—譯自世界語科學雜誌（Scienca　Gazeto）—</p>
<p>在羣星間的空間中，有着無數大小和種類不一的石塊，牠們恒久的沿着隣近的星球和行果的軌道，依着引力，在宇宙中游離着。這些石塊，在其運動中，常時有的便遇到星球，行星或衛星而隕落下來，這就是所謂「流星」。「流星」是「隕石」的俗稱，這個俗稱不很恰當，因爲「隕石」實在並不是「星」。這中間的最大區別是大小問題，「星」的直徑有達百萬基羅米突以上者，而「隕石」的直徑則也許只有一米突，或甚至只有一糎。</p>
<p>隕石在其游離中，常會碰到地球上面的空氣，同時因受空氣的摩擦而生熱，直至熱度達到焦點或沸點。如果這是一顆大的隕石，那牠也許就直落至地面上而轟然作聲；也或許就在中途燒掉，但在其種塲合，我們仍能見到天空中有一道光芒閃過。</p>
<p>隕石降落地球，其速度各不相同，最快的大約每秒鐘可達四十基羅米突。至於牠毋隕落在地面上的數量，據說單是一日之間，就有幾百萬顆之多，並且有的或許還很大，而地球每天也就這樣的增加了幾十萬萬格蘭姆的重量。</p>
<p>我們所常見到的隕石大都很小，可是有時却墜下些極大的，其中有兩顆大隕石是我這裏所要談及的。</p>
<p>在美國西南部亞里蘇那州（Arizona）的平原中，隣近卡儂地埃白羅（Canon　Diablo）的地方，有一個著名的噴火口叫做康布得（Coon　Bufte）。牠的直徑有一千三百七十米突，深度一百八十米突，四壁高出平原約三十米突。據說在有史以前，有一顆大隕石隕落在這地方，陷地極深，因而形成了這個噴火口。這事實，一般科學家久已認爲可信。二十年來，探索工作，從未間斷。最後，經使用電氣方法加以考騐，大槪地已探得了這隕石的所在。據探尋所得結果，知這隕石陷入在這噴火口的西南角下面，深度二百十米突之處。於是再下一番鑽孔鑿穴的工夫，這些科學家乃在深度二百米突之處發現了這隕石的堅硬部分（卽隕鐵）；由於這具有特性的隕鐵，他們便認知了這是隕石。這次的發現給了我們一種啟示，使我們對於月球上的許多噴火口可以作同樣的解釋。上述的亞里蘇那噴火口，有很多地方和月球的相似，只是大小有些不同而已。我們不難這樣的想：遠在月球的幼年時代，有許多隕石隕落在月球上，因而形成了許多的噴火口。至於亞里蘇那噴火口，自其形成以迄於今，據估計亦有五萬年之久。關於記述牠的材料，不必說是得不到的；我們所能想像的，只是當時震耳的轟擊聲，燭天的火光，以及土人心中的恐怖而已。</p>
<p>一九〇八年六月三十日，西伯利亞也有一顆極大的，聲震遐邇的隕石下降。牠雖在未擊地以前卽已碎成片片，但牠確是非常巨大。聞當時爲那陣狂風所吹倒的樹林，竟佔直徑達一百十五基羅米突的面積之廣；同時牠（隕石）還發出連珠般的巨響，好像有許多大砲在連續不斷地施放似的。據目擊當時情形的人說：牠所發的光燦爛如日，牠的火柱甚至長達九十六基羅米突；牠的熱度很高，風力也很强</p>
<p>（譯者按：蘇州有所謂大石頭巷者，若干年前亦有大隕石墜至該處，因以得名，聞該石現尙存於該港之某姓屋內。）</p>
<p>不過，話得說回來。有些隕石卽使很大，但隕石終不是恒星。牠大概只是碎裂的慧星的一部分，或已形成的行星係的碎裂物而已。</p>

<h3>評大科學家秦斯的「科學底新基礎」</h3>
<p>— 舍翁</p>
<p>秦斯是現代世界聞名的大科學家，在英國要算數一數二的天文學和物理學者，又是劍橋大學的數學講師。他的　作都是很新近的科學成果，並且不只是技術的叙述事實，而是用過一番思考，根據他自己的哲學見解，作了深刻的理論說明，以理論去組織他的科學的著作。其中所探求，論列和記述的科學事實，也都是很新穎的深刻的科學發現，這是無用詳說的。現在丟開其他著作不管，單來批判一下他在一九三三年才出版的「科學的新基礎」這本名著罷。這本書在中國的譯本是去年在辛墾書店出版的，譯者爲譚輔之君。這本書中間的確句含得有許多可寶貴的豐富的科學材料，凡是研究科學的人，甚至要知道許多最新發明與近年來科學的理論發展到甚麼地步的人，都不可不讀。不過以二十萬字的巨著，其所討論的科學事實範圍又非常廣泛，所以要在這樣小小一個書評中將那些科學的事實及其理論提出來加以檢討，實在沒有可能。因此這裏我只簡略地對於他用以貫串其全部理論之哲學的觀點，作一個大題小做的批判，對於讀者也許有一點貢獻。因爲爲了理解新近的科學的發展，旣不能不去讀一讀這部書，然而他的哲學觀　之鎝誤，又不能爲我們所接受，則略加指出他的缺點。以免讀者爲其錯誤的理論所淆亂，</p>

<p>就有相當的必要。</p>
<p>秦斯在這本書中所表現的思想，完全是一種唯心的純經騐論和意志自由論者的觀點，因此他以兩點基本的思想來貫通其全部科學理論的叙述。其中的第一點基本思想，是認爲一切新的科學事實，不斷地在修改由來所認識的外界之結論，從來所認爲是客觀的物質世界的結構和法則的東西，一步一步被研究所破壞和否定了。因此，他覺得那些東西，只能算作那些時代的科學家自身的心理的感覺與經騐的要素之結合物，並不是眞實的外界法則。這就是說，過去的科學成果是出於個人的心理的經騐之想像物，所以它才在新的研究中不斷地發生動搖。如此則新的科學的發現呢？仍不過是循着舊路走的，仍不過是新的科學家根據自己的心理的經騐與戚覺而作出的新的解釋。因爲照歷史的指示，這些旣成事實與規律，將一樣會在後繼者的新的研究之前粉碎它的堅定性，由合理的變爲不合理的。這樣一來，我們的客觀的認識只不過靠着各人自身的經騐要素之綜合而已，我們自以爲認識了客觀，實際上並沒有認識客觀，所以外在的世界之眞實我們是不可知其究極的。我們所自認為已經知道了物質世界的眞諦，而實際上並不是物質世界的眞婦，却只是心理的要素之結合的幻像。像這樣的意見的例子多得很，比如他在第一章」接近外界之道」中，首先就這樣晚着：「舊的哲學在十九世紀之末已失去了它底作用，而二十世紀底科學者，爲其自身，則鎚鍊出一新　哲學來。其主要之點是：物理學者再不把自然看做是完全與自身截然分離的東西。有時它是自身所創造的，或選擇的或抽象的；有時它是他所破壞了的東西。」爲什麼如此？因爲譬如觀察虹霓一樣，「每一個人底虹霓都是他自己底眼睛底一個選擇」。因此，雖「無論如何這不是意味着要暗示一個客觀的自然並不存在，但却是意味着在現在客觀的自然是超越我們底能力範圍。我們只能看見我們本身所製造的塵土之雲所糢糊了的自然」。秦斯爲什麼懷疑科學的能力，否定科學所獲得的一切法則是自然的客觀性的東西呢？就因爲他看到新的量子論，電子論，相對論，無定原理等等，一步一步地擊破了過去認爲是眞實的客觀事象與規律之絕對的質量觀，運動觀，時空觀，機械的因果性，有定論等等。但是秦斯却不知道，第一，過去的科學定律雖也有許多幻想的成分，但不能說其中完全沒有眞實的自然法則的發現。近代的科學之更深入的研究，雖也對它有所修改，但其所修改的只能是其錯誤的部分而不是推翻它的全體，其所補充的也只是補充了它的缺陷，而不是絕對的與牠相反。比如對於物質之質量不滅定律，雖然過去在把它適用於個別物的觀察，錯誤地付予了它以絕對意義，但不能說宇宙物質總量的不減性也錯誤了。近代新物理學認爲物質不滅定定一律已不適用，在我們看來倒是那些科學家自己爲觀念諭的觀點所蒙蔽，對於新的科學材料　誤的理解的結果。至於一切新的發現，如果我們不輕率地上判斷，而能正確的以新哲學的觀點去認識它和處理它，則　足以處處證明物質世界之客觀存在和其動的變化過程那種新宇宙觀之正確。</p>
<p>因爲秦斯是感覺論或練　騐論者，因爲他是康德思想的物不可知論者（縱令他也如康德一樣承認有物自體），所以他由一切知識並不來自客觀世界的思路，很自然地走入了第二點基本理論中，卽走入了意志自由的理論中。所以他到處高唱着無定論，蓋然律，而否認因果决定論。他以爲一切都可以有許多可以選擇而不確定的道路，如像對於電子能測知其位置卽不能同時測知其運動速度，熱力學發現了第一法則，却又攢出來、一個第二法則指示出能力變換中沒有可逆過程那樣，因而就說「只要相信自然界是機械的，從而是决定的，則如上的推測到底是不會容許的。」選擇的自由，在他心且中是有無限權威的，所以他把主張「對於自然界也不容許不决定性底可能之論，而且主張人問與自然同樣不過機械底輪齒，這機械只向着其預定的終極驅轉下去，」的人，認為「是極端的人」，對於蒲郎克和愛因斯坦否定自由意念的說法，也採取着不相信的態度。自然，純機械論也是我們所反對的，但無論如何自由意志卽在人類中也不能發現的東西，還不要說無機的自然界。秦斯付予了現代科學以理想主義，於是就以爲「今日所達到了的最後地點上，非精神的東西底大部分乃至幾乎全體都消解了，從非精神的東西之中，不能出現何等新的東西」。那麼全宇宙都靈魂化和幻想化了，秦斯還在研究什麼？這部科學著作不是徒勞嗎？你以自由意志去任意選擇，選擇了一切道路亂走，也以自由意志去構成了宇宙的一切圖案，則秦斯的大著自身就失掉了客觀性和科學價値，又能爲誰說敎呢？在空虛的心理的世界之中一切都只是心理的　像物，秦斯自己怕也不能被確定爲人或鬼罷，因爲你自己也可以被視爲任意幻想的客體的綠故。</p>
<p>總之，秦斯這部著作，雖然我們不能抹殺其所提供的科學材料，然而他却以材料去將就他自己的歪曲觀點，所以在理論的方面，卽哲學的方面。是完全錯誤的，讀者應防備着，免得爲他的理論引導你誤入了思想的歧途。</p>

<h3>提賬簿（三）</h3>
<p>— 濮漁</p>
<p>坐上了車，腦筋裏重複的轉念頭：今天究竟怎磨辦？事情順利不？……其實有烏個公事！祇由於局長昨天來封快信，叫我約束職員不要胡幹，據說省局裏的風聲不好。老賓地說：就因爲這句話纔動了心，纔有今天「查案」的發生；我知道「風聲不好」的後面，緊跟着位置不穩，這玩意我很懂。你想再不趕快撈幾個子兒，將來找個卵？好在局長一時不會轉來，也許在活動關節，正好私自做樁買賣。但是說到子兒也不好撈，像我們這樣有身份的人却不會綁票。所以昨兒晚上老是睡不着，翻來覆去的纔想起：元太的生意比較好，本錢够，乘一個把竹槓還不在乎；好在前兒出的酒，沒有領去完稅證，…今兒早上五點鐘便爬起來，一壁吩咐文牘寫硃單，同時叫江鍚五向會計處領封條。你想，如果不是自己想撈錢，誰願意找這麻煩？假如眞的爲了「公事」，隨便派一個稽徵員也得了。</p>
<p>說到想「錢」，也非我的天性，老實地說，我在學生時代最恨收稅的人員，誰也知道打典當委員那一次，我一個人最鬧得兇，就是初初混進官塲，也沒有大改從前的性兒；每每見着閒僚們那種生吞活剝的情形，總是裝滿了厭惡的意味。可是近幾年來多閱歷了幾分人事，覺得錢　貞西很値得寶貴；有了牠，事業都得開展。譬如說吧：我同局長原祗一點瓜葛，那時他還瞧不起我。可是當他活　菸酒局的時候，需要二千塊應酬費，一時周轉不靈，很覺發急。我看他的事情有成功的希望，於是自吿奮勇的借給五百元，　磨一來他就認爲我很够朋友，馬上把大大拇指一伸，第二天便委我當主任——自然是口頭舌的。你看看這「五百元」的作用多麼大；旣結交一位有面子的朋友，還當了一個不大不小的「官」。其實不必比喻那麼大，就是玩意事，也要有錢纔漂亮，哼，你在揚縣窑我敢斗　說一句：縣政府張科長，印花稅王所長，都不及我受歡沖；這並非我的地位高，臉膛兒好，實在說來，還不是由於肯化幾個錢！</p>
<p>說到這兒，我眞有點內愧：我想方設計的撈錢，也是爲了彌補這些漏洞，名義上我雖是「主任」，但正薪水却不過四十元。這一筆可憐數目，給老婆縫褲子都不够。你想，不另找財喜又怎樣過活？前天她又跑去看牌，輸現二十元不說，還借彭太太五十元，我勸她捱着不給，反駡我不要臉面。媽的，毫不替我想想：當了一年主任，纔存　二千九百塊，假如一旦丟差，這點錢又能幹什麽末事？</p>
<p>想到自己的前途，眞覺不寒而慄，目前唯一的希望，便是：局長的位置不變動，——高昇就好——今天的事情順利。說句眞話：我眞沒有，鋤拕個金娃娃的壞心眼，祇要二百元就暫時可以了却三樁志願：一，給老婆還賭博賬。二，銀行存摺的數目字，換上『三〇〇〇』的整數，其就給小紫紅做花頭。——鬼曉得，那妮子眞有勾人魂魄的勁兒。——想來眞覺可憐，左盤右算不過區區『二百』，在元太那樣大的資本，算個什末？但十個商人總有九個『奸』，要他的錢等於要命。不過元太李二爹，比較受、吃一點，頭次的事情我就摸着性兒的！</p>

<h3>巴黎美人心之盛況</h3>
<p>霞飛路巴黎大戲院開映范朋克主演之「美人心」一片，在陰雨迷濛中，昨，日竟吿四塲客滿，足見觀衆眼光非淺，不愧爲鉅片中之鉅片，但聞該片映期無多，因卽須運往外埠，故欲觀此片者，幸勿交臂失之。</p>
<h3>明星半月刋三卷三期出版</h3>
<p>明星公司出版，華威貿易總公司發行之「明星半月刊」，自革新號以來，銷數已逾三萬，爲中國電影雜誌中銷數之最高紀錄。本期三卷」期，巳於日昨（十六日）出版，編排方面更趨新穎，內容亦充實不少，而又不失原有之輕鬆活潑，文字方面加刊「半月閒話」及「明星講座」，該欄每期由明星公司導演，編劇，攝影，置景，收音諸先生撰稿，內容側重於技術研究和實際問題的討論，本期山歐陽予倩先生主講，題爲「綿劇與導演的合作」。其次有達士譯的蘇聯埃慈伊托夫著的」蘇聯藝術電影」，尤爲重要。「半月間」本期則爲無軌專車」，OutFocus　Close　Up兩篇，則係軟性趣味文字·照片方面，封面爲新娘胡蝶之軍人裝，（雙色版）封底爲（春之花）開工大吉之劇照，「男男女女」，「舒繡文近影」「明星新片號」「慕後人影」，「新星袁紹梅」「怒目橫肩一，「刦役後桃花」，「影人攝影集」等作品多副。漫畫有葉淺予，陳涓隱，黃堯，黃苗子，江棟良，姚國絲，金劍凡等作品。「讀者信箱」本期爲李萍倩等答客問，售價仍爲五分，各報攤書店均有代售云。</p>
<h3>「特別偵探」將公映</h3>
<p>是「一身是膽」的姊妹作</p>
<p>大光明大戲院，自開映派拉蒙鉅片「萬星拱照」以來，因該片內容，極爲富麗新奇，賣座甚爲擁擠。該院於「萬星拱照公映後，初擬接映「阿國風雲」及「南極探險記」兩片，茲因特殊關係，已決定改映「特別偵探」Special　Agent一片。該片爲華納公司繼「一身是膽」的姊妹作，導演威廉凱萊，亦即「一身是膽」的導演。片的內容，係描寫一位女英雜，奮不顧身地去緝捕一班不法的强徒。蓋「一身是膽」是說G-Men'而「特別偵探」是說T-Men'，戰鬥之烈，後片更甚於前片云。</p>
<h3>西藏的神秘將公演</h3>
<p>中國的老百姓大都是信佛的，而信佛的大本營都在西藏。在西藏，佛徒遍全境，而執最高權力的，也是佛徒，所以西藏有佛國之稱，西藏的省會拉薩，也有佛都之稱。</p>
<p>佛敎有許多是很神秘的，西藏，爲了交通的不便，文化落後，所以成了一個神秘的去處，然而西藏的美景天成。礦產天富，所以帝國主義者對之頗有野心。近年來，我政府注意開發邊疆神秘的西藏，自然在注意之例，所以曾派黃慕松氏入藏，而月明公司就組織了入藏攝影隊，把西藏的神秘，完全攝入鏡頭。</p>
<p>月明的入藏攝影隊回來後，經過了幾個月的埋頭整理，第一部片子已將整理完成，定名『神秘的西藏』，不久卽將正式公映，那末，西藏的神秘，種種意想不到的神秘，卽將公開在諸君之前了，敦請諸君拭目以待。</p>

<h3>Belgian Ambassador Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday to Express Sympathy to President Wang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Belgian Ambassador, Mr. Guillaume, arrived in Nanjing on the 16th and went to the Central Hospital with Mr. Danarfo, the counselor of the embassy, in the afternoon to express sympathy for President Wang's condition. (16th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Belgian Ambassador, Mr. Guillaume, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 16th, and in the afternoon, accompanied by Mr. Danarfo, the counselor of the embassy, went to the Central Hospital to express sympathy for President Wang's injuries. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Hospital announced at 5:00 p.m. on the 16th a report on President Wang's condition: "President Wang's body temperature was 36.9 degrees Celsius, pulse 82, and respiration 16 at 4:00 p.m. today. President Wang still felt tired when receiving guests today, and the attending physician stipulated that he should stop receiving guests within one or two weeks." (16th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It has been half a month since President Wang was injured in the assassination. As the Fifth Plenary Session is being held and people from all over the country are gathering in the capital, the Central News Agency reporter specially asked Chu Minyi on the morning of the 16th to ask if it would be permissible for the reporter to visit the patient in person and have a short conversation. Chu notified the reporter to go to the Central Hospital at 4:30 p.m. At the appointed time, the reporter arrived at the Central Hospital, and the doctor was examining President Wang's wound and checking his temperature. It was not until 4:50 p.m. that the reporter was allowed into the ward. When Wang saw the reporter, he smiled and raised his hand in greeting from the sickbed, saying to the reporter, "I haven't seen you for more than ten days. I am very grateful for the concern of comrades from all sides." The reporter saw that Wang's hair had been cut short, his spirit was very good, his complexion was slightly thin, there was a slight red thread under his left eye, and the gauze applied to the left was only about an inch in size. Otherwise, everything was as before, and there was not much difference. The reporter told Wang that since he was injured and admitted to the hospital, the outside world was very concerned because many people had not been able to see his injuries in person, especially during the Congress meeting, when comrades from all over the country asked about his recent injuries and treatment. Wang was deeply pleased to hear this. He also told the reporter, "In the past, when Yingshi was assassinated in Shanghai and Zhixin was assassinated in Humen, I did not have time to go. When Zhongyuan was assassinated at the Guangzhou Railway Station and carried back to the Governor's Office, I rushed to comfort him. Zhongyuan smiled and said, 'Seeing your sad and urgent appearance makes me feel comforted even if I cannot die.' Zhongkai was assassinated at the Central Party Headquarters and ascended to Zhongshan Hospital. I rushed there, but he had already died. I only saw Mrs. Liao crying. When I was assassinated at the gate of the Central Party Headquarters, I was shot three times. I thought I was going to die. I wished to follow Yingshi and other martyrs. I felt at peace and justified. The comrades' flustered and comforting appearance was just like when Zhongyuan was assassinated. But Zhongyuan is gone, and my injury is not fatal, and I have famous doctors, so I can still live to comfort the comrades. Revolutionaries sacrifice themselves, and death is not enough to worry about. Although the country has reached this point, it is also fortunate to be alive. But since I have this remaining life, I should still do my best to fulfill my intentions and strive to work hard, so that I can comfort my comrades." His spirit was extremely cheerful, and he told the reporter, "Recently, the injury is not very painful. I get up and sit for five minutes every day, and I can extend it to seven minutes. At first, I felt dizzy, but now I have no suffering. However, it will take some time to practice standing and walking before I can return to normal." At this point, the reporter thought that the conversation had taken a long time, and asked him to rest before leaving. (16th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Educational Broadcasting</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>When we walk through the city streets, we often hear the various broadcasts received by radios. Storytelling in Suzhou dialect, Shanghai opera, jokes, and sensual songs are often heard. In essence, they are a microcosm of feudal thinking and a manifestation of decadent temperament. Shops use them as a means to attract customers, and families use them as a way to pass the time. Immersed in them morning and night, they gradually change and imperceptibly influence people. Listeners who receive this education will inevitably be affected in their thinking and behavior. What is even more noteworthy is that young children and young students are in the process of receiving life experience, and they encounter this soft education that does not require supervision. This will completely offset the proper education received at home and school, and the effectiveness will be invisible. Is this an overstatement? It is really heartbreaking. Some people are competing for freedom, and it seems that the relationship between broadcasting and receiving is far less important than freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and religion. It seems that everyone can enjoy freedom and not be subject to any restrictions. However, from the perspective of society, anything that affects the public cannot but ask what the impact is. If it is bad, restrictions will follow. We must not use freedom as an excuse to allow it to harm the public. This is a clear and easy-to-understand common sense, and it is also an iron rule of modern society. The administrative authorities have regulations to ban radio broadcasts. Newspapers have also published articles advocating distinguishing between good and bad and choosing the good and discarding the bad. The intention is good, but we still feel that the screening is not strict enough and the restrictions are too broad. It is only a passive ban and does not seek an active replacement. As a result, recreational songs with feudal thinking and decadent temperament are either disguised or remain in their original form, and still roar in our ears morning and night. For the sake of changing customs, it is even more important to take a further step and strive to make good use of this tool of civilization.</p>
<p>This semester, the Ministry of Education is conducting educational broadcasts on the Central Broadcasting Station. Every day, people are invited to give lectures on various subjects. Separately, they are all essential common sense. Combined, they form a whole system. The local public education centers and secondary schools are required to have a radio to listen to these broadcasts. This is a further step and is indeed a good plan. Public education centers are not only located in cities, but also in many towns and villages. Those who set foot in them are not without illiteracy. These people cannot use the tools of writing, and they are cut off from the essential common sense of life. Waiting for them to receive literacy education before they can quench their thirst is indirect and circuitous. It is better to make them listen to the directness of the broadcast. Therefore, if public education centers can attach importance to this and widely recruit the public to attend lectures on time, the macro effect will be no less than opening several literacy schools. As for secondary schools, it is common to invite people to the school to give lectures. However, the lecturers are free to choose the topic, and they do not form a system with each other. Now, listening to educational broadcasts can obtain systematic supplementary knowledge in addition to the regular courses of various subjects. If the school authorities can lead the students and listen carefully, instead of treating the orders as a mere formality, the amount of progress in the students' knowledge and ability will be considerable. It is hoped that the lecturers of the broadcasts will make their lectures easier, not avoiding in-depth, but striving for simplicity. It is best not to use the boring and solemn lecture style, but to use the friendly and interesting conversation style, so that listeners can not only easily enter their ears, but also deeply imprinted in their hearts. Those who lecture for public education centers must avoid all specialized academic terms. The wording and wording should be adapted to the compatriots who have not yet received a formal education. The words will not be uttered in vain, and the efforts will not be in vain. It is also hoped that commercial radio stations will follow suit and set more programs with proper educational meaning. Even those that are only for entertainment must be estimated to have absolutely no bad effects before they can be selected. Recreational songs with feudal thinking and decadent temperament must be eliminated as much as possible. If the tools of civilization are not used well, they will all be sufficient to help evil. It must be as described above to be considered a good use of this radio machine for broadcasting and receiving.</p>
<h3>Increased Exports of American Goods to Italy; Hull Warns Merchants Again; Supplying Belligerents Violates Neutrality Law; If They Take the Opportunity to Seek Profit, They Will Be at Their Own Risk</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull issued a serious warning to oil, copper, and freight car exporters today, stating that the sale of these goods to Italy directly violates U.S. policy. This statement is the most stringent step to protect U.S. neutrality, and its effect is equivalent to formally declaring that the items listed, although not military supplies, are important war materials. Hull also stated that President Roosevelt had warned that this trade should be at the merchants' own risk. He personally stated on October 10 that the United States had no intention of encouraging belligerents to end the war as soon as possible, which would quickly stabilize world commerce. The American people should know that some goods, although not military supplies, are major war materials. According to the government's recent report, the export of these goods continues to increase. Hull further explained the government's views on this trade, stating that this trade directly violates the government's policy and the spirit of the Neutrality Law. It is said that the government is now closely monitoring exports to belligerents, and the South is ready to complete a list of items shipped to belligerents in the past few days, so that a precise comparison can be made with exports during the same period last year.

Hull then issued a statement that such a tariff agreement is enough to show progress contrary to economic suicide, and this agreement is also enough to show that world economic relations must be improved as a basis for peace. The content of the agreement has not yet been announced today and may be released within the next week. (15th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S.-Canada trade agreement was signed here today by Secretary of State Hull and Canadian Prime Minister King.

<p>(Moscow) Senator Borah, at the request of an Associated Press reporter, criticized the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth government, saying that the Philippines will feel the difficulty of maintaining independence after the transition period. However, the Filipinos are now free and independent. In addition to congratulating them, he deeply hopes that they will always be so. Although I have not specified a specific country in mind, various parties have many speculations about whether the Philippines can maintain its independence. Regarding the United States' neutrality in the East Philippine War, Borah stated that the United States' neutrality law should expand its scope to include various reasonably inspected raw materials.

<p>(Geneva) According to speculation from the League of Nations, when the Supreme Council of the Italian Fascist Party meets today, it will probably decide, at the request of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, that Italy will not attend any political meetings of the League of Nations during the League of Nations' sanctions period. (16th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Italian Fascist Party Holds Supreme Council Meeting to Discuss How to Deal with Sanctions; Commander of the Italian Army in the North Replaced</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party is scheduled to meet at the Palazzo Venezia starting tomorrow, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini. It is expected to meet multiple times. The meeting ceremony will be as solemn and magnificent as possible, as in every session. The Prime Minister's personal guard will be stationed in front of the Palazzo Venezia. It is generally believed that the meeting will not result in a decision to withdraw from the League of Nations. However, the diplomatic decisions made at this meeting will inevitably be extremely important. (15th Havas Agency Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Fascist Party Members' Declaration in Italy</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Fascist Party's Supreme Council will meet with Prime Minister Mussolini tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM to discuss retaliatory plans against the League of Nations' sanctions. The council will announce a ban on the import of goods from countries participating in the sanctions, and may even cancel debts owed by countries with large trade surpluses. This move will severely impact England, France, Belgium, Russia, and Sweden, as exporters in these countries will suffer great losses if their governments do not compensate Italy for the confiscated debts. (National News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Fifty members of the Fascist Party's Supreme Council will convene at 10:00 PM tonight to discuss Mussolini's talks with British Ambassador Drummond and the implications of the British elections. It is expected that Mussolini will issue an important declaration regarding Italy's response to countries imposing sanctions. The plan is to (1) establish the basis on which Italy will remain a member of the League of Nations; (2) reiterate that Italy cannot withdraw from Abyssinia; and (3) devise detailed plans to resist the sanctions. The third item will classify imports into three categories: (1) essential goods and raw materials that Italy cannot produce, including coal, iron, oil, and steel. These items may be imported from any country with a license, and should be purchased from the cheapest market; (2) luxury goods such as wine, spices, and newspapers may be imported up to a certain percentage of the 1934 import volume, with priority given to countries not imposing sanctions; (3) gold, silver, and copper coins will be considered free imports. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa was replaced today by General Badoglio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, succeeding General De Bono. This is quite surprising. According to the official announcement, the reason for the replacement is that General De Bono has completed his mission after capturing Chima Gall, and is now retiring. Mussolini sent a sincere telegram to General De Bono today, and Italy has promoted De Bono to the rank of General. People in Rome believe that General De Bono, who is already 69 years old, is retiring due to exhaustion from the small victory. The General has been commanding operations in the north since the start of the war, and has been highly praised by the public. He has white hair and a bright gaze, and previously established military achievements in the Libyan War and the European War. Mussolini first met the General when he was a soldier. The new Commander-in-Chief, General Badoglio, is 64 years old and has served as Chief of Staff of the Army since 1932, and is one of the most strategically gifted military men in Europe. In 1921, he went to the United States as a special envoy, and later served as the ambassador to Brazil. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Italian Women Present Wedding Rings to Mussolini</h3>
<p>To be melted to offset sanction expenses</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, several women presented their gold wedding rings to Mussolini to be melted to offset the expenses of resisting sanctions. These rings will be replaced with steel ones engraved with the words "Save the Nation." It is estimated that if all ten million Italian women offer their wedding rings to the nation, the treasury could gain approximately £15 million in English currency. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>The United States Has No New Silver Law</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Borah, leader of the silver faction, stated today that he is unaware of anyone drafting a new silver law to be presented to Congress in January of next year. However, Borah added that he knows the silver issue is currently very quiet, and he will support Senator McCarrado's amendment to eliminate the 50% silver profit tax to restore freedom to the American silver market. McCarrado previously submitted a similar bill to the last Congress, but it failed to reach the Senate floor for discussion. (National News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>The Result of the British General Election: Cabinet to be Reorganized, Baldwin Issues Address to the Nation, Striving for National Revival and World Peace, Living Up to the Mandate</h3>
<p>(London) According to the current results of the British election, the government party has won 421 seats, while the opposition party has won 178 seats. According to political circles, Prime Minister Baldwin will find a parliamentary seat for Lord President of the Council MacDonald, but he may not be able to do the same for MacDonald's son. Both MacDonald and his son have been defeated. Furthermore, current Secretary of State for Air Lister and First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell will also resign, so the cabinet will inevitably be reorganized as soon as possible. It is expected that Lister will be ennobled and become a member of the House of Lords. It is also expected that Secretary of State for War Halifax will resign, and the most likely successor is Minister without Portfolio Eden. Churchill, a Conservative Party member who has held important positions in British politics and enjoys a high reputation, has now been elected. There are widespread rumors that Churchill will return to the cabinet, but if this rumor comes true, it will raise many problems. Therefore, it is expected that British Prime Minister Baldwin may not actually intend to invite him into the cabinet. Last night, Baldwin announced to the nation that "The result of this election is excellent. The people have clearly expressed their trust in the government's continued work to seek national revival and world peace. He is deeply grateful for those who have worked hard to achieve this success. In the future, the government will strive to live up to the mandate of the people." Attlee, the leader of the Labour Party, expressed his opinion, saying, "The result of this election is somewhat disappointing in terms of the number of seats." Communist Party member Gallacher was elected after a three-way battle, which has not happened in the past six years. A total of 65 women participated in the election, and 16 were elected, including the daughter of former Prime Minister Lloyd George. The Labour Party's biggest victory was in the Durham constituency, where the Labour Party won all eleven seats, restoring its original position before the 1931 election. Conservative Party member Wren, who is known as an authority on Chinese issues and often questioned events in the Far East in the House of Commons, was defeated this time. Republican Party member Leddy was sentenced to three years in prison in the South Irish Free State, and his friends campaigned for him, but he ultimately lost by more than 13,700 votes, which is one of the most peculiar events in the election. The Speaker of the House of Commons, FitzRoy, was re-elected with a majority of more than 8,100 votes, even though he did not participate in the election campaign. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Gains and Losses of Each Party, How to Get MacDonald into the House of Commons, Baldwin Consolidates Peace Policy</h3>
<p>(London) As of 9:15 PM last night, the government party had a majority of 243 seats over the opposition party. At that time, there were still 16 seats for which the results were unknown.</p>
<p>The government party won a total of 421 seats, including 379 Conservative Party seats, 31 Liberal National Party seats, 8 National Labour Party seats, and 3 seats from other parties. The opposition party won a total of 178 seats, including 153 Labour Party seats, 4 Independent Labour Party seats, 16 Liberal Party seats, 4 Independent Liberal Party seats, and 1 Communist Party seat. The government party's majority decreased from 411 seats (in the dissolved parliament) to around 250 seats. This is generally considered beneficial to the House of Commons, as it is expected that the majority party will not become negligent due to its large majority, and the minority party will not be discouraged by the government's overwhelming advantage. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) As of 8:00 PM tonight, only 14 seats in the election have not been announced. Of those known, the government parties have won a total of 423 seats, including 382 Conservative Party seats, gaining 8 seats and losing 80 seats, 8 National Labour Party seats, gaining 2 seats and losing 6 seats, 31 National Liberal Party seats, gaining 3 seats and losing 11 seats, and 2 Independent seats, gaining 1 seat. The opposition parties have won a total of 178 seats, including 153 Labour Party seats, gaining 97 seats and losing 4 seats, 15 Liberal Party seats, gaining 3 seats and losing 12 seats, 4 Independent Labour Party seats, gaining 1 seat, 4 Independent Liberal Party seats, and 1 Communist Party seat, gaining 1 seat, and 1 Independent seat, losing 3 seats. The government party has a majority of 245 seats. (National News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Lord President of the Council MacDonald and his son were both defeated this time. However, it was learned today that both still have hope of re-entering Parliament. It is said that members elected in safe districts may resign so that the two can be elected in by-elections. After the Conservative Party's major victory today, Prime Minister Baldwin issued an address to the nation, saying that the result was excellent, and the whole country now supports a united government and trusts in their will and ability to continue to shoulder the work of national revival and world peace. Observers predict that after the Conservative Party's victory, it will quickly restore the principle of "protecting what is ours" and will strengthen Britain's attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian dispute and its leadership of the League of Nations. Increasing military preparations may also become a reality. (National News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Lord President of the Council and National Labour Party leader MacDonald was defeated in the Seaham constituency with 17,882 votes. His political opponent, Shinwell, received 38,380 votes, a significant difference. It is generally believed that MacDonald's defeat is a serious blow to the form of the National Cabinet. Labour candidate Shinwell declared after being elected, "The number of votes I received was even more than expected. The National Cabinet is based on MacDonald as its cornerstone. Now that he has been defeated, the cabinet will inevitably suffer a major impact." Furthermore, extreme conservative leader Churchill was re-elected in the Epping constituency, receiving 34,849 votes. The Liberal Party candidate received 14,430 votes, while another Labour candidate received only 9,758 votes. Minister of Agriculture Elliot competed with the Liberal Party and the Labour Party in the Kelvin Grove constituency in Glasgow. Although he was elected, his position is in danger because the Liberal Party and Labour Party candidates have protested the election procedures, claiming they were invalid. The ballots in that area are currently being examined. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) As of 8:15 PM tonight, the results of the House of Commons election have been fully announced. The number of votes obtained by each party is as follows:</p>
<p>Government Party:</p>
<p>Conservative Party: 10,185,770 votes</p>
<p>National Liberal Party: 829,224 votes</p>
<p>National Labour Party: 353,061 votes</p>
<p>Non-aligned: 59,887 votes</p>
<p>Total: 11,423,742 votes</p>
<p>Opposition Party:</p>
<p>Labour Party: 8,268,595 votes</p>
<p>Samuelite Liberal Party: 1,345,420 votes</p>
<p>Lloyd George Liberal Party: 65,150 votes</p>
<p>Independent Labour Party: 139,577 votes</p>
<p>Non-aligned: 119,437 votes</p>
<p>Communist Party: 27,126 votes</p>
<p>Total: 9,965,305 votes</p>
<p>As for the number of seats, the government party has a total of 420 seats, while the opposition party has only 176 seats. The number of votes obtained by the two parties is not far apart, but the number of seats obtained is very different. This is the key to this election. In summary, the main reason for the Labour Party's victory is that the government's propaganda work focused on foreign affairs, while the Labour Party candidates devoted all their efforts to domestic issues, especially economic and social issues. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The following table compares the number of seats won by each party in this House of Commons election with the House of Commons elected in 1931:</p>
<p>Party | Seats Gained | Seats Lost | Total</p>
<p>(Government Party)</p>
<p>Conservative Party | 8 | 81 | Lost 78 seats</p>
<p>National Party | 1 | 5 | Lost 4 seats</p>
<p>Non-aligned | 1 | 2 | Lost 1 seat</p>
<p>(Opposition Party)</p>
<p>Labour Party | 99 | 3 | Gained 96 seats</p>
<p>Liberal Party | 2 | 15 | Lost 13 seats</p>

<p>Communist Party | 1 | 0 | Gained 1 seat</p>
<p>(Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The reason why the government party candidates were able to maintain their positions in many industrial areas in this election was due to two major factors: (1) the success of the tariff policy; (2) the hope for an increase in military spending. Many constituencies adversely affected by these two matters changed their inclination and supported the Labour Party. For example, in the Mensdes area, all the members of the previous parliament were Conservative, but now four seats have been won by the Labour Party. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Observers with inside information believe today that the Baldwin government will strive to consolidate world peace based on the following broad methods:</p>
<p>(1) Resolutely contain the Italian-Abyssinian War within the scope of the League of Nations, without wavering.</p>
<p>(2) Avoid implementing military sanctions against Italy.</p>
<p>(3) Find ways to reduce the crisis of conflict between Britain and Italy.</p>
<p>(4) Immediately strengthen national defense capabilities.</p>
<p>(5) Strive for British-American cooperation. (National News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers today stated that the National Government's majority of at least 250 seats in the election is a verdict of the people approving national unity, and a guarantee of domestic stability and continued foreign policy. The Times pointed out that this is not only a victory for a government with unprecedented records and an honest political program, but also a victory for the British people, as the British have shown the world their proof of their readiness to act. The Financial Times stated that the prices of various securities on the stock exchange immediately rose, reflecting the people's relief. The Daily Mail stated that the impact of the British government's election success will be felt worldwide, and Britain's prestige will be increased as a result. General overseas public opinion believes that Britain's firm support for peace, progress and prosperity, and its determination that British national policy will remain unchanged over the past four years, can be seen in the results of this election. The Parisian Le Figaro reported that happy England can now steadily continue its policies. Viennese newspapers stated that Europe must know that British policy will not change. A Berlin local newspaper stated that Britain now acts in Geneva with greater authority than before. Another German newspaper said that Baldwin has obtained the vote of confidence he requested. The Roman Post stated that Eden is still in Congress, fearing that Britain's attitude will not change. The New York Weekly stated that the results of this election in Britain are a beneficial sign that stability, moderation, and sound economics are still valuable today. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Naval Conference, British-American Cooperation Expected, Japanese Representative Departs for London</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed observers here today predict that British-American cooperation will be closer than before at the naval conference. It is said that this cooperation was promoted by President Roosevelt's statement on October 5, which stated that the US government does not want to interfere with the League of Nations sanctions against aggressor nations because of American merchants. This statement indicates that the United States has abandoned its long-standing principle of freedom of the seas, and guarantees that the United States does not want to interfere with other countries hindering American wartime trade, thereby eliminating all misunderstandings between Britain and the United States. As for Japan's attempt to dominate the Far East, it is the second reason for promoting British-American cooperation, because Japan's ambitions are enough to threaten the interests of both countries in the Far East. (National News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The plenipotentiary of the Japanese naval disarmament conference, Nagano, issued a statement before leaving, saying that the current disarmament conference is being attended by five countries: Japan, Britain, the United States, Italy, and France. Because the Washington and London treaties have expired, a new treaty is being re-drafted. Japan's fundamental disarmament policy is to agree on the maximum amount of military strength that can be retained among the world's major naval powers, and to strive to reduce that limit in order to achieve disarmament in reality, and to completely abolish or drastically reduce offensive military strength in order to achieve armaments that do not threaten or invade. The Japanese government firmly believes that this is a just and appropriate disarmament agreement, and it is the best way to contribute to world peace. We will attend the meeting, exchange opinions with representatives from various countries, and make our best efforts to complete an agreement based on Japan's fundamental policy. Looking back on last year's preliminary negotiations, there were many difficulties in front of Japan's claims. However, we earnestly hope for the united assistance of the whole country so that we can achieve our important goals. (Japanese United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A public telegram was sent to Tokyo stating that Britain and the United States are forming a common front at the London Naval Disarmament Conference, refusing Japan's demand for equality in naval armaments. The Japanese naval community expressed extraordinary indignation, believing that Japan's plan for a new agreement has been stopped by Britain and the United States, so the future of disarmament is already hopeless. A naval leader issued a statement saying, "It is regrettable that Britain and the United States are tacitly understanding each other in order to maintain their naval superiority and opposing Japan's equal demands. In the future, world peace will be greatly threatened. Since a new agreement is hopeless, the future of disarmament is unbearable to hear. However, this responsibility must be shared by Britain and the United States." (China United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Reforms Monetary System and Abolishes State-Owned Stores</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The currency reform decree announced yesterday by the People's Committee has sparked various speculations among observers in this country. The decree does not specify whether the government will maintain the ruble or the gold ruble. The ruble is currently the legal tender, with its gold reserves exceeding 1,000,000,000 rubles, each ruble worth approximately 87 US cents. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The government yesterday ordered the abolition of the state-owned store system and decided the value of the ruble to be three French francs. As a result, all goods throughout the country will be priced uniformly, no longer referencing foreign currencies. Previously, there were three types of pricing for goods in Soviet Russia. The first was for special stores, catering to workers and public servants, with limited quantities sold at extremely low prices. The second was for public stores, selling Russian products without quantity restrictions, but prices were slightly higher than those for workers and public servants. The third was for state-owned stores, exclusively selling foreign goods, but requiring payment in foreign currency. In 1934, the government abolished special stores, while increasing the salaries of workers and public servants to enable them to purchase goods from public stores. Subsequently, due to significant progress in Soviet Russian industry, the prices of ordinary public stores gradually declined, rendering state-owned stores useless. They were mostly deserted and had very few customers. Furthermore, with the promulgation of the new law, the distinction between Soviet citizens holding foreign currency and those without has been eliminated. Throughout the country, only the ruble is recognized as legal tender. Previously, the exchange rate was 13.60 francs per ruble, but foreigners were unwilling to exchange rubles at this rate due to the availability of state-owned stores where they could use foreign currency. Moreover, the actual purchasing power of the ruble was previously less than three francs. Now that it has been set at three francs, the living standard of foreigners will improve. The Soviet authorities hope that the purchasing power of the ruble will increase in the shortest possible time due to continued price declines. Consequently, the level of trade and living within Soviet Russia will be on par with that of capitalist countries. The Soviet government's choice of the French franc as its currency standard is due to its price stability, indicating that Soviet Russia and the Gold Bloc countries have aligned themselves. (Havas Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The total industrial output of the Soviet Union in the first ten months of this year (excluding local industries) was 32 billion rubles, an increase of 22.5% over the same period last year. Heavy industrial products accounted for 19.6 billion rubles, an increase of 25.6% over the same period last year. The output of the food industry was 4.4 billion rubles, exceeding the same period last year by 24.6%. The output of light industry was 4.5 billion rubles, an increase of 9.6% over the same period last year. (TASS Dispatch, 15th) (TASS Moscow Correspondence, October 22) During the first and second Five-Year Plans, Soviet retail trade increased more than sixfold. This year alone, domestic retail trade has increased by 35%, while the prices of various important foods have also seen a rapid and systematic decline. In the past three months, the prices of more than 30 kinds of goods have been reduced. On October 1st this year, compared to the prices in December last year, bread was reduced by one-half, sugar by one-third, rice and meat by two-thirds, and butter, vegetable oil, and sausages by one-half. In the first half of this year, urban consumers saved 600 million rubles due to price reductions. The 활발activity of commerce resulted in the abolition of all kinds of food coupons on October 1st this year. Currently, hundreds of new meat, fish, milk, and bread shops have been added in various cities and villages, with sufficient goods. The output of the Soviet food industry this year exceeded the planned amount by hundreds of millions of rubles. The annual plans for butter, cheese, and sausages have all been completed. The Soviet Union's reduction in prices has not only not caused the decline of commerce but has also made it flourish rapidly. In the first two weeks of October, the trade volume in Moscow reached 425,005,000 rubles, while in the same period in September it was only 399,000,000 rubles. Sales of butter and vegetable oil have almost doubled, and meat, fish, and sugar have also seen a significant increase. Due to the abundance of goods, state-owned and cooperative shops have not only reduced the prices of food but also the prices of textiles, soap, tobacco, and other items. In mid-October, meat prices in various Soviet cities decreased by an average of 30% compared to September, and butter decreased by an average of 20%. Therefore, the resolution of the 17th Congress of the Communist Party to reduce retail prices by 35% during the second Five-Year Plan has been realized.</p>

<h3>Account of Sun Chuanfang's Assassination: Shi Jianqiao Claims Revenge for Her Father</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Former Commander-in-Chief of the Five-Province Allied Army of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian, Sun Chuanfang, after retiring from public life, lived in seclusion in Tianjin, devoted to Buddhist studies. On April 1st of last year, he and former Prime Minister Jin Yunpeng jointly established the Buddhist Laymen's Forest at the Qingxiu Nunnery in the Caocheng Factory on South Ma Road. Jin served as the Director, and Sun served as the Chairman. Every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, during the scripture chanting sessions, Sun and Jin would attend the site. Sometimes, they would go together with their wives. On Wednesday the 13th, during the Laymen's Forest scripture chanting session, Sun, carrying a servant, took his private car and went to the site at 3:15 PM. As he was reciting Buddhist scriptures, he was suddenly shot to death by a young woman, about 30 years old, with a handgun. The hero who once commanded five provinces and shook the nation a decade ago was brought to his end. The following is a record of the circumstances of Sun's assassination:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Assassination: The 13th was the scripture chanting day for the Laymen's Forest. The weather was rainy that day. Around 2:00 PM, Abbot Fuming of the Laymen's Forest telephoned Sun's residence to ask if Sun was coming. Sun replied, "Start at the designated time. I may not be able to make it due to some business. Don't wait for me." Following his instructions, Fuming started chanting with the congregation. At that time, a young woman arrived and chatted with other women. When asked about her name, she said it was Shi Jianqiao. She came to chant scriptures out of faith and claimed she had not yet joined the Laymen's Forest. She requested an introduction to join. The other women replied that the Laymen's Forest required an introduction for men to join, but there were no restrictions for women. She only needed to fill out a volunteer form. An elderly woman gave her the form and asked her to fill it out. As the young woman was filling out the form, Sun arrived with a servant and spoke with Abbot Fuming. After Shi Jianqiao finished filling out the form, she announced that she had business and called a car using the telephone. She suddenly left, then returned about ten minutes later and went straight into the Buddhist hall. She sat cross-legged on the cushion behind Sun. Sun was sitting on the west end of the Buddhist table, facing east. He did not notice Shi's arrival. Shi sat for less than five minutes, then took out a handgun from her side, stood up, walked behind Sun, and fired a shot at Sun's head. The bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his left temple. Sun immediately fell to the side of the Buddhist table with a thud, and blood splattered all over the scriptures. At that time, everyone in the hall thought something had happened outside and strained their ears to listen. Shi then fired a second shot, the bullet piercing through his back and exiting through his chest. Fearing that he was not dead, she fired another shot at Sun's head. Brain matter and blood splattered everywhere. The men and women chanting scriptures, seeing Sun being killed, panicked and fled. The assassin put the gun into her pocket, took out several pieces of paper from her side, distributed them, and shouted, "I am avenging a wrong. Do not be alarmed." She then walked into the telephone room to make a self-report. At this time, the monks and nuns of the temple took the opportunity to escape and reported the incident to the police. Officer Wang Huanan rushed to the scene and encountered Shi next to the telephone. Shi, seeing the police officer, said, "I'll go with you after I finish making the phone call." The police officer immediately stopped her from making the call and went to the First Police Precinct with Shi.</p>
<p>Court Examination: Yan Jiaqi, the director of the First Police Precinct, upon hearing the news, immediately telegraphed the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, and led bureau members Tu and Zhou and police chief Xue Peilu to the scene of the incident. Patrol officers were stationed at the alley entrances, blocking traffic. Liu Yushu, the Director of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, also went with Inspector Meng Guangming. As a result of the search, no suspects were found. Because the incident occurred in the temple, the officer instructed the police to take the administrator, Fuming, into custody. He then telegraphed the local court for an examination. At about 5:00 PM, prosecutor Tu Zhang was sent to examine the body. Sun's body was lying with his head facing north and feet facing south, covered with a cotton quilt. He wore a blue Daoist robe, a blue silk cotton robe, gray silk cotton trousers, a blue flannel undershirt, a white cloth belt, white socks, and blue satin shoes. The examination revealed that the corpse had three gunshot wounds: one entering the back of the head, with the bullet lodged in the right eyebrow and not fully penetrating; one entering below the right forehead and exiting from the left temple; and one entering from the left back, passing through the five internal organs and exiting from the front chest. During the scene examination, the bullet was found among the small cotton jacket buttons. A paper cigarette case and dozens of miscellaneous bills were also found. He was confirmed to have died from gunshot wounds. After the examination, the prosecutor ordered Sun's brother-in-law, Zhou Yinting, to claim the body and transport it to his residence in the British Concession.</p>
<p>The Murderer's Confession: After the examination, the director of the First Police Precinct immediately returned to the station to interrogate the murderer. According to her confession, "My name is Shi Jianqiao, I am 30 years old, from Anhui Province. I currently reside at No. 176, 10th Road, British Concession, this city. My husband's name is Shi Jinggong, and he is currently serving as a deputy in the instructor corps of a certain army in Shanxi. I have two children at home, the eldest is seven years old and the youngest is two years old. My father, Shi Congbin, was the former front-line commander of the Zhili-Shandong-Henan Allied Army. He was killed by Sun Chuanfang at the Bengbu train station on October 3rd, 1925. He left behind five sisters, three brothers, and an elderly mother. I am the eldest. I was 20 years old that year. Upon hearing the news, my entire family was grief-stricken. Although I had long planned to avenge my father, there was no opportunity for revenge during the warlord era, so I suppressed my anger and waited for an opportunity. Soon after, I took residence in Tianjin. Anxious to avenge my father, I secretly investigated the whereabouts of Sun Chuanfang every day. A few days ago, I heard the Buddhist society leader, Sun Zhiyuan, preaching about Buddhist scriptures on the radio at the Laymen's Forest and recognized his Shandong accent. I immediately determined that he was Sun Chuanfang. I then bought a car and went to the gate of the Renchang Broadcasting Station to investigate whether it was Sun. After waiting for a while, I saw Sun coming out, proving that Zhiyuan was indeed Sun Chuanfang. The desire for revenge arose spontaneously. I immediately bought a No. 3 Browning handgun, along with six bullets. On October 3rd, the anniversary of my father's death, I held a memorial service at the Guanyin Temple on Garden Street in the Japanese Concession and invited Abbot Fuming and others from the Laymen's Forest to chant scriptures. I asked Fuming et al. whether chanting scriptures for the deceased was effective. They claimed it was indeed efficacious; otherwise, why would Sun Lian Shuai, Jin Zongli, etc. participate? I then asked what position Sun Lian Shuai held and when he would arrive at the temple. They replied that he was the Chairman and would definitely be at the temple during each scripture session. I immediately expressed my desire to participate in the scripture chanting, and the abbot agreed. Although I met Sun Chuanfang several times during the chanting sessions, there were many Buddhists present, and I was afraid of harming others, so I was unwilling to act. This afternoon, I went at 2:00 PM and saw that there were very few people chanting scriptures and that Sun Chuanfang had not yet arrived. Unexpectedly, as I was talking to others, Sun Chuanfang's car arrived. He got out of the car and entered the temple. Seeing that the opportunity for revenge had arrived, I did not have a handgun with me at the time. I went out and hired a car to rush home, took out the handgun, and returned. I shot and killed Sun after chanting for a short time. Three bullets remained. Seeing the police coming, I turned myself in." During the interrogation, Shi's attitude was calm, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Fuming's Confession: The First Police Precinct interrogated the monk Fuming after interrogating the suspect Shi. According to his confession, "I am 48 years old, from Shanxi province, and have been the abbot of the Qingxiu temple for many years. The Qingxiu temple and the Laymen's Forest are two separate entities. Last year, Sun Lian Shuai (Chuanfang) and Xin Zongli (Yunpeng) often came to chant scriptures, and they discussed it with the monks, setting up a Laymen's Forest, with Jin Zongli as the Director and Sun Shuai as the Chairman. They would go to chant scriptures every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, sometimes going with Jin Zongli. Every time they came, they would bring their wives. Today, due to the rain, they came alone, without their wives. After the incident, everyone listening to the lecture and the monks in the temple were all startled and scattered. Therefore, I only heard the sound of gunfire and saw Sun Lian Shuai fall to the ground in blood. I do not know how he was attacked. The woman who committed the crime had only been to the temple a few times and had not been introduced by anyone. No one in the temple knew her, so I do not know why she committed the crime." The Public Safety Bureau, believing that the abbot had no major involvement in the case, allowed him to be released on bail that night.</p>
<p>The Suspect is Sent to Court: When Shi Jianqiao, the perpetrator, was sent to the First Public Safety Bureau, her demeanor remained unchanged, and her expression was normal. Her face was plump, and there was no ferocity in her brows. She was robust, wearing a blue wool jacket and a dark blue long cheongsam. At around 9:00 PM, she was transferred from the First Public Safety Bureau to the Public Safety Bureau and detained in the detention center. At around 12:00 AM on the 14th, Section Chief Ma Bingqing of the Third Section of the Bureau interrogated Shi. The confession of the female Shi was consistent with what she had confessed at the First Police Precinct. At 7:00 AM, the Public Safety Bureau escorted her to the local court's prosecutor's office. The bureau gave her special treatment, allowing Shi to bring her bedding and take a hired car. They also handed over the evidence: a "371407" No. 3 Browning handgun, three bullets, a badge of the Buddhist Laymen's Forest, a string of prayer beads, a photograph of Shi Congbin, a letter to the people of the country, and many flyers. That night, the prosecutor on duty at the prosecutor's office opened the court for investigation. The female Shi's confession was the same as before. She was immediately sent to jail to await investigation.</p>
<p>Sun's Corpse is Coffined: Sun Chuanfang's remains were transported by his family in a long-distance car to Sun's private residence on 20th Road in the British Concession on the evening of the 13th. At 4:15 PM on the 14th, his concubine and four sons personally oversaw the preparation of the coffin. His eldest son had received the news in Ping that night and had also rushed back. After the coffin was prepared, the whole family mourned. Sun's old comrades and friends came to offer condolences. The iron gates in front of the private residence were closed, and the sound of mourning could be heard from outside, which was especially painful. Sun's legal wife died early. During his lifetime, in order to prevent disputes over property between his four sons from different mothers in the future, Sun had clearly analyzed the shares. The two sons from the legal wife had been living separately for many years. Only the concubine and the third and fourth sons lived with Sun. His funeral arrangements were handled by Jin Yunpeng and Wang Chengbin, his old colleagues and comrades. Most of his estate was real estate, mostly in Dalian, and friends will take care of it in the future.</p>
<p>Liu Yushu Speaks: Liu Yushu, the Director of the Public Safety Bureau, rushed to the scene after receiving the report. Liu was an old subordinate of Sun and had served as the director of the Songhu Police Department. Seeing the tragic death of Sun, he was dismayed and wept. Liu said that based on the suspect's confession and the printed materials she distributed, the circumstances were simple. It was a daughter avenging her father. The case should be transferred to the court after the investigation is complete. However, before the whole truth is clarified, we must pay attention to whether there are other backgrounds involved.</p>
<p>Suspect's Propaganda: After killing Sun, Shi Jianqiao distributed various propaganda materials, including a piece of paper with the following printed on the front: "Attention, everyone: (1) Today, Shi Jianqiao (originally named Gu Lan) killed Sun Chuanfang to avenge my father, Shi Congbin. (2) For details, please read my letter to the people of the country. (3) The great revenge has been avenged, and I will turn myself in to the court. (4) I sincerely apologize to the Laymen's Forest and everyone for the shock caused by the bloodshed in the Buddhist hall. Signed, Daughter of vengeance, Shi Jianqiao." On the back were two seven-character poems: "(1) I dare not forget my father's revenge for a moment, and I grieve even more for my mother's frosted temples. Although I fear hurting my kind mother, the timing does not allow me to delay any longer. (2) I cannot bear to look back on ten years ago, things remain the same, but the scenery has changed. I often go to the forest not to worship Buddha, but to seek death, not immortality." Her letter to the people of the country was a mimeographed leaflet, more than a thousand words long, describing the origin of the feud between Sun and Shi and the circumstances of her revenge. The general idea was that "Ten years ago, Sun beheaded her father, Congbin, at the Bengbu train station. Sun callously killed a model soldier. After ten years of accumulating grievances, I did not have the opportunity to act. Today, I have killed my enemy and avenged my great revenge. I am willing to be punished by law," and so on. Shi carried a photo of her father, Shi Congbin, in military uniform, which she handed over to the First Police Precinct. On the back of the photo, written in blue ink with a fountain pen, was "The posthumous portrait of General Shi Congbin, who was framed by Sun Chuanfang at Bengbu Station ten years ago."</p>
<p>Looking Back at the Past: Shi Congbin was from Tongcheng, Anhui. He joined the army at a young age and gradually rose to the rank of brigade commander. In 1925, Shi served as the commander of the 47th Mixed Brigade and was stationed in Shandong. He also served as the garrison commander of Jinan. When Zhang Zongchang led troops from the Northeast and entered the customs to march south, Shi was the first to send a telegram welcoming him and went to Dezhou to meet him. As a result, he won Zhang Zongchang's favor and was given the title of Shandong Military Affairs Assistant. Zhang Zongchang and Yang Yuting led their troops to capture Anhui Province, and Shi volunteered to serve on the front lines. Zhang Zongchang also made an agreement with him.</p>

<p>Scientific Talks</p>
<h3>The Development and Use of the Brain (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Lu Zidao</p>
<p>4. Development of the Brain's Highest Center</p>
<p>We already know that the function of nerves is related to the development of nerve tissue. For example, the brain, the center of our thoughts, also has a certain developmental sequence. Just like the motor area on the cerebral cortex of a cat, when the foreleg area has already developed, the head and hindleg areas still do not show function. After the foreleg area has developed, the head only starts to function, and finally the hindleg area.</p>
<p>In our human brain, there are many fibers connecting the front and back, left and right directions on all parts of the skin. The myelin sheath of these fibers also develops in stages, with each part having different times. Some are more important, such as those controlling the movement of hands and feet, the hearing of the ears, the sight of the eyes, and the smell of the nose. Therefore, the areas that control these functions develop myelin sheaths first. Conversely, the functions of association, thought, imagination, etc., which are higher-level functions, develop myelin sheaths later.</p>
<p>After slicing the cerebral cortex, observations under a microscope show that the location of fibers with myelin sheaths can be divided into three layers: outer, middle, and inner. The number of fibers in these layers differs depending on age. The older the age, the more fibers there are. Generally, development is fastest before the age of 18, and then slower, but it can last until about 40 years old. This phenomenon is most obvious in the inner and outer layers. After the age of 50, it decreases slightly, but the number is very small.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is a misconception that the brain no longer develops after the age of 25. We can still learn and use our brains before the age of 40. Even after the age of 40, we can still use them as much as possible, only the motor aspects are relatively retrogressive. Therefore, thinking aspects can always be developed to the greatest extent before the age of 70; while athletes rarely win after the age of 40. Based on our ordinary experience, the ages of 30 to 50 are the prime of life, and most people make contributions and build careers at this time. Around the age of 70, people gradually show signs of deafness and blurred vision. Therefore, from childhood to the age of 30, we should learn as much as possible, and from the age of 30 to 90, we should fully utilize our intellect and serve society. Of course, there are many great figures in history whose careers were achieved particularly early, such as Alexander the Great, who conquered Greece at the age of 21 and Persia at the age of 25. However, these rare geniuses from ancient and modern times cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>5. Use of the Brain</p>
<p>However, although our brains grow continuously from birth to the age of 40 or 50, they are useless if not used properly. We are influenced by family education, social education, and school education at all times. Everyone knows that the brain is like a sharp blade, it is not sharp if not used. Therefore, we should always use it to develop it fully. If we pay attention to the national character of Germany and France, French people often rely on talent and are good at tricks; while Germans do not rely on talent, but everyone works hard, so they work hard and diligently. As a result, there is no doubt that France produces many geniuses, but the science of Germany is more developed, and the national organization is more rigorous. This is due to the fact that their people are good at using their normal brains. As the saying goes: "One good plan is not as good as ten cobblers." We can understand the importance of diligently using the brain by carefully considering this saying.</p>
<p>So how do we use our brains? There are two major principles for using it. The first is to develop a healthy body. With a healthy body, the brain has sufficient nutrients, and then a healthy spirit is produced. The second is to cultivate ourselves well according to the principles of the mental nerve system organization. This kind of training can be divided into three aspects. One aspect is the motor organs, such as skills and manual actions. Our total training is an example. Another aspect is the sensory organs, such as training the hearing organ to become a musician, training the visual organ to become a painter and calligrapher, and training various sensory organs to become a writer; another aspect is association, such as practicing mathematics and logic to become scientists and philosophers. School education should be based on these principles to cultivate well-rounded citizens so that they can make full use of their brains. We individuals should also encourage ourselves in this way so that we do not waste the brains that nature has given us.</p>

<p>had an agreement that "if Anhui is captured, the Beijing government will be asked to appoint Shi as the military governor." Later, when he fought against Sun Chuanfang at Gutie, Shi went deep in an armored train. When Zhang Zongchang's troops could not hold on and retreated, the railway was cut off by Sun's army, and Shi was captured. After being imprisoned for a short time, Sun ordered him to be beheaded and his head hung on an armored train, with the words "The head of Shi Congbin, the newly appointed military governor of Anhui" written in large red letters. He died at the age of fifty-eight. (15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Officer Corps Arrives in Shandong</h3>
<p>Commander of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, Tada Kureto, to Arrive Soon</p>

However, due to the rainy weather that day, it did not happen. Instead, they took the Pinghu train and arrived in Jinan at 3:30 AM on the 14th. Japanese Consul Nishi and others greeted them at the station. After disembarking, Sasaki and the others first went to the Jinshui Hotel to rest. Then, at 9:00 AM, they went to the Japanese military attache's office in Jinan to ask Mr. Mababa and Mr. Urajima about the actual situation of the May 3rd Incident. They also asked Mr. Nishiki Hiroki about the state of material supply at that time and Mr. Tanaka Hikohiko about the refuge of Japanese residents at that time. At 11:00 AM, accompanied by Japanese military attache Ishikawa, they visited the Japanese Memorial to Fallen Soldiers. Next, they visited the Japanese Civil Group Consulate. At 12:00 noon, they visited Han Fuqu, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, at the Provincial Government. Han immediately hosted a banquet at Xihua Hall, which ended at 1:30 PM. The Japanese officer corps then toured the famous scenic spots in the city at 4:00 PM. At 6:00 PM, they attended the welcome meeting held by the Japanese Home School Association at the Public Assembly Hall. At 3:30 AM on the 15th, they went to Qufu for sightseeing. Tada Kureto, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, was originally scheduled to come to Jinan on the 17th, but was unable to do so due to unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, he rescheduled his departure from Tianjin on the 18th. It is reported that Tada will go to Qingdao to visit the Japanese Commercial School's military training. Here is a list of the names of the Japanese officer corps: Major Sasaki, Major Nakajima, Captain Ito, Captain Nagamatsu, Captain Kono, Captain Muto, Lieutenant Oobi, Captain Katayama, Captain Yamaishi, Lieutenant Miwa.

<h3>Forthcoming Establishment of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association</h3>
<p>Zhou Zuomin Discusses an Overview of the Association's Organization; Head Offices to be Established in Tokyo and Shanghai</p>
<p>From our Beiping correspondent: Zhou Zuomin, General Manager of Jin Cheng Bank, traveled east from Shanghai at the beginning of the month to investigate the economy. After completing his business, he returned to the country and managed affairs in Shanghai. On the morning of the 15th, he arrived back in Beiping. That evening, at the request of the press, Zhou freely discussed his experiences during his trip to Japan and the preparations for the Sino-Japanese Trade Association. He said, "My recent trip to Japan for investigation left me with a very good impression. The records of the investigation are currently being compiled by the participants and will be completed soon. As for the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, after the economic circles of both countries decided to organize it, preparations have now begun, and we hope to establish it before the 5th of next month. Head offices will be established in both Tokyo and Shanghai. Each head office will have 25 directors, from whom seven standing directors, one chairman, and two vice-chairmen will be elected to be responsible for handling association affairs. The chairman of the Shanghai head office will be Chinese, and one of the vice-chairmen will be Chinese and the other Japanese. The Japanese vice-chairman will be concurrently the chairman of the Tokyo head office, and if he cannot come to Shanghai to work, he can send a representative. The chairman of the Tokyo head office will be Japanese, and the vice-chairmen will also be one Chinese and one Japanese. The Chinese vice-chairman will also be concurrently the chairman of the Shanghai head office, using the same method as the chairman of the Tokyo head office concurrently serving as the vice-chairman of Shanghai. The scope of the association's affairs and future plans will be determined in the near future. Regarding the establishment of the Preparation and Custody Committee in Tianjin after the currency reform, and the Ministry of Finance's designation of myself (Zhou referred to himself) as chairman, because I do not reside in Tianjin for long, I do not intend to take on the position and plan to telegraph for another appointment to take on the special responsibility." Zhou finally discussed the current situation, saying that, as far as he knew, at a time when Sino-Japanese relations had shown improvement, there should not be any serious facts as rumored.

<h3>Mayor of Beiping Qin Dechun's Talk on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>At a Reception for Newspaper Reporters, He Said No New Incidents Have Occurred in North China</p>
<p>From our Beiping correspondent: Since taking office, the Mayor of Beiping, Qin Dechun, has rarely met with visiting reporters due to the current situation. On the afternoon of the 15th, from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, he specially held a tea party at the Municipal Government to entertain the press. In addition to explaining his apologies for not being able to meet with reporters, he briefly discussed the current situation and general issues to stabilize public sentiment in society and dispel rumors. More than forty reporters attended. The remarks Qin made during the event and his answers to the reporters' questions are recorded below.</p>
<p>Qin's Remarks: Mr. Qin briefly stated, "Since I (Qin referred to himself) took office, government affairs have been piling up. I deeply regret that many colleagues from the press have gone to the trouble of visiting, but I have not been able to personally receive them one by one. Today, I am very fortunate to be able to meet with you all and have a cordial conversation. Beiping is a world-renowned city with a long history and a large population, and it is the center of politics, culture, academics, transportation, industry, and commerce in the North. In these difficult times, we can only seek the healthy development of municipal administration under the grand principles of good neighborliness and internal stability to achieve the realm of rectifying virtues, utilizing resources, and enriching people's lives. However, this matter is of great importance and has many obstacles. It cannot be achieved by one person's effort in a short period of time. The government and the people must work together to achieve results. The press is the ears and eyes of society, and the mouthpiece of the people. The Municipal Government must uphold the spirit of respecting public opinion and legally protecting it in the future. At the same time, it also hopes that colleagues from the press will share the burden of the times and speak cautiously to avoid causing public unease. As for the implementation of municipal administration, all major aspects such as public security, education, production, sanitation, and public works are related to the happiness of 1.5 million citizens. I sincerely hope that colleagues from the press will provide unreserved criticism and guidance. The Municipal Government will do its best to implement whatever it can."</p>
<p>Answering Reporters' Questions: After Qin finished speaking, Guan Yixian, the president of the Shibao Newspaper, was publicly elected by the press to deliver a response. The reporters also inquired about the situation, and Qin answered them one by one. (Question) What is the actual situation of Sino-Japanese diplomacy recently? (Answer) Ambassador Jiang returned to China some time ago and attended the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Regarding the overall direction, I believe it is being negotiated between the central departments of both parties. As for local issues, no new incidents have occurred in North China recently. General Matsui's visit is for travel and inspection purposes. (Question) What is the implementation and impact of the new currency decree in the North? (Answer) This matter is of great importance. On the one hand, we must take into account national laws and regulations, and on the other hand, we must consider the actual situation in the North. Commander Song (Zheyuan) is very concerned about this matter. The government has now ordered the establishment of a Tianjin Preparation and Custody Branch. In addition to the personnel already appointed by the government, it seems that more impartial and influential local gentry and merchants should participate together to demonstrate credibility. Although the Beiping side is handled by the Tianjin Branch, cash must be stored locally to reassure people. In short, as long as cash does not leave the country, the market will remain calm. If there are unscrupulous merchants and troublemakers who take the opportunity to profit and arbitrarily raise prices, affecting people's livelihoods, the government will severely crack down on them. (Question) What about the personnel issues in the Municipal Government? (Answer) When I took office, I solemnly declared that the personnel of the Municipal Government are all based on talent. Currently, the various bureaus and offices are operating as usual, and there have been no changes. (15th)</p>
<h3>Bandits Discovered Disturbing Miyun and Huairou</h3>
<p>Over Three Hundred Bandits Come from Outside the Pass with Complete Firearms and a Formidable Presence</p>
<p>From our Beiping correspondent: On the evening of the 13th, over three hundred bandits from outside the pass suddenly appeared in the area of Dashuiyu and Fengkou on the western border of Miyun and Huairou counties. They were fully armed and had a formidable presence. Deng Wenhan, the head of the first battalion of the First Security Brigade stationed in Miyun, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched the first company, along with the second company stationed in Huairou, to rush there overnight to assist the local police and militia in fighting back. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Chawu Village in Changping County, fifteen li west of Huairou, at dawn. The merchants and residents of the village were robbed clean, and over fifty mules and horses were stolen, along with over forty men and women taken as hostages. After the robbery, they entrenched themselves in the Wangjialue area, fifteen li northwest of Chawu Village, to demand ransom. The Huairou police and militia are still strictly guarding various key points near the Nanduh River. The troops of Feng Shoupeng, the security team stationed in Changping County, have also been ordered to move out and suppress them. (15th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Winter Defense in Songjiang County Begins</p>
<p>In the four rural areas of this county, robberies are frequently heard. County Magistrate Li, in order to eliminate banditry, has issued a general order to all districts, townships, and towns to set up watch posts and install wooden barriers at important ports to prevent robberies. Previously, a winter defense conference was convened, and the various matters to be handled were carefully discussed and approved. A winter defense office was established in the county government, with the county magistrate as the director, An Brigade Adjutant Zhao Zanchen, Captain of the Waterborne Public Security Team Pan Zhensheng, and Public Security Bureau Chief He Runzhang as deputy directors. Branch offices are set up in each district, with the district chief as the director. The winter defense period is set for three months, starting from the 16th and ending on February 16th of the 25th year. During the winter defense period, business hours are regulated. Tea houses and restaurants in urban areas must close by 9:00 PM, and entertainment venues and cinemas must close by 11:00 PM. If suspicious persons are encountered, they may be inspected at any time. Tea houses and restaurants in rural areas must cease business by 8:00 PM. County Magistrate Li has ordered all township heads to relay the instructions for compliance.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>The Authorities Deny Rumors and Prohibit Relocation</p>
<p>Recently, many rumors have spread in this county, and many residents have been misled and moved away. In order to maintain public order, the Public Security Bureau issued a notice on the 15th, stating that recently a small number of villains have spread rumors, and residents have been fooled and have moved away, affecting public order, which is deeply regrettable. In addition to ordering subordinates to strictly arrest the rumor-mongering villains and punish them according to military law, in the future, residents are expected to live in peace and engage in their occupations. If there are legitimate reasons for relocation, they must report to the local public security bureau to obtain a relocation certificate before being allowed to pass.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Chambers of Commerce from Various Counties Meet in Suzhou</p>
<p>The chambers of commerce of Wu County, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changshu, and over twenty other counties will hold a meeting of representatives from various county chambers of commerce at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th at the Wu County Chamber of Commerce to discuss the issue of the existence or abolition of the business corps in various counties. Representatives from various counties have been separately appointed and are scheduled to come to Suzhou this morning to attend. The Wu County Chamber of Commerce has been preparing for the reception and will host a banquet for the representatives of various counties that evening.</p>
<p>The Fishmonger Uprising Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>Outside the Su Gate at the Chaotian Bridge pier, there are eight fish firms, including Xie Renchang, who have been using the cash standard for transactions. On the 15th, three to four hundred fishmonger women went to sell fish, and the firms wanted to switch to the silver dollar standard. The fishmonger women refused, so the firms hired fifty people to carry fish into the city for sale. All the fishmonger women then gathered at the entrance to block them, causing a conflict. Thousands of fresh fish were scattered all over the ground and trampled into mud. The police station in charge sent officers to mediate. Three police officers, Qian Yuqing, Zhao Yufeng, and Patrol Chief Wu Yinsheng, were also beaten. The situation was quite tense for a while. The Public Security Bureau dispatched a large number of police officers to persuade them and convened representatives from both sides to a meeting at the 10th branch of the Business Corps. It was resolved that (1) shrimp and black carp would be converted to the silver dollar standard, while the rest would remain on the cash standard, and (2) the copper coin exchange rate would be based on the daily afternoon market price. The uprising was resolved.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Conflict Between District Chief and Station Master</p>
<p>District Chief Tao of the sixth district of Qingyang Town, Cheng County, solicited three silver dollars from the town's bus station master, Gao, on the afternoon of the 16th for a flood donation, which led to a quarrel and great disorder. For unknown reasons, Station Master Gao injured an arm and reported the injury to the Cheng County Government for examination. In the afternoon of the same day, it was widely rumored in Wuxi that the Qingyang Bus Station had been destroyed. When reporters made long-distance calls to Qingyang to inquire, it was not as serious as rumored. It was actually due to a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>New Bridge on Shuyuan Lane Suddenly Collapses</p>
<p>A new wooden bridge north of the Xiyou Printing Company on Shuyuan Lane in the city suddenly collapsed entirely at 9:00 AM on the 16th. The Construction Bureau dispatched personnel to investigate and find ways to rebuild it. However, the Xinmin Bridge inside Guangfu Gate is also under reconstruction, so traffic in both places is cut off, and pedestrians and vehicles have to take Luohua Lane and Yingshan River to enter the city, causing inconvenience.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Financial Department Approves Autumn Harvest Quality</p>
<p>This year's paddy fields in this county have been affected by rice borers, resulting in a reduced quality autumn harvest. After re-examination by members of the Civil, Financial, and Construction Department, it was reported that the county's collection quota was 8.6 percent. After verification by the Financial Department, it was changed to 8.9 percent and ordered to be notified. The quotas are as follows: 82.7 percent in the first district, 54 percent in the second district, 98 percent in the third district, 98.5 percent in the fourth district, 98 percent in the fifth district, 101 percent in the sixth district, and 86 percent in the seventh district. Land value tax will be collected according to the quality.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>County Residents Appeal for Reduction or Exemption of Surtaxes</p>
<p>This county has the highest surtaxes in Jiangsu, including education land tax, defense land tax, etc., totaling over 468,000 yuan per year. In these years of disasters and poor harvests, the rural economy is bankrupt, and the people cannot bear the burden. Therefore, over a hundred county residents, including Yu Minzhi and Chen Bokang, have jointly petitioned the Financial Department to follow the example of Nantong and appropriately reduce or exempt various surtaxes to alleviate the people's difficulties. They also appeal to local agencies and organizations to organize a surtax reduction research committee to discuss the matter together in order to be thorough.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Abolition of Many Kinds of Exorbitant Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies</p>
<p>Since November 16th, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies have been abolished in Tong County, including wheel-turning tax, pig miscellaneous tax, etc., totaling twenty-six kinds, with a tax amount of 27,141 yuan. The county government has ordered all districts to stop collecting them uniformly.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Economic Commission Replies to Stock Association</p>
<p>The Jinan Salt Production Seven Company Stock Association, due to the diversion of the Yellow River and the construction of dikes to block the Yellow River breaches, telegraphed the National Economic Commission some days ago. Now, the commission has replied in a letter, stating, "Your telegram has been received and noted with great concern. The discussion of the Yellow River's diversion is of great importance, and this commission will carefully consider it. As for the construction of dikes to block the breaches, this commission has consulted with the Shandong Provincial Government to take responsibility for handling it, and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission will assist in the process and start construction. This commission is urging them to expedite the process and aim for early completion. A corresponding reply is hereby sent for your information." It is reported that the letter has also been forwarded to the Lianghuai Salt Transportation Office, the Huainan Salt Transportation Deputy, the Huaibei Audit Office, and the governments of Donghai, Lianshui, and Guanyun counties, as well as all the branches and stores of the Yangzhou Seven Companies.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Xu Qingfu Summoned to the Capital Yesterday</p>
<p>Xu Qingfu, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, was previously repeatedly called upon by the Minister of Finance, Kong, to request the return of a 4 million yuan advance payment due to the provincial finance being in an extremely dire state, but there was no result. It was originally planned to issue 4 million yuan of provincial treasury bonds to remedy the situation, but the plan to issue provincial treasury bonds was implicitly cancelled due to the recent central government's implementation of currency reform. During the chairman of the provincial government, Huang Shaohong’s, trip to Beijing to attend the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, he discussed the matter with Minister Kong, and subsequently telegraphed Hangzhou to summon Xu to go to Beijing to discuss everything in person. Xu left for Beijing on the 8:10 AM Beijing-Hangzhou train on the morning of the 16th and will return to the province within a week.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>A Large Number of Jiangbei Refugees Are Causing Trouble</p>
<p>Starting on the 14th, a large number of Jiangbei refugees arrived in the Jiudun Dangshan Bay area of eastern Xiaoshan, causing trouble from house to house. Some were dressed as monks and Taoists, forcefully soliciting donations and acting recklessly in groups of three or five along the streets. The local township head telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police to suppress them and drive them out of the area. On the 15th, they began heading towards Anchang.</p>
<p>Educational Broadcast Special</p>
<h3>The Benefits of the Gregorian Calendar (Continued)</h3>
<p>(Broadcast to the National Public on November 8th and 10th)</p>
<p>Researcher at the Institute of Astronomy, Academia Sinica, Chen Zunqui</p>
<p>Now that we already know how the current Gregorian calendar is structured, we can go a step further and talk about its benefits. Its benefits can be divided into four levels.</p>
<p>First, the number of days in each year is fixed, which is 365 days or 366 days. Unlike the old lunar calendar, which can vary by up to a month.</p>
<p>Second, although the size of each month is not fixed, it is very easy to remember. Now, please take out your left hand and make a fist. The knuckles of the fingers on the back of the hand are protruding, and the middle of the knuckles is concave. Now, we call the protruding ones "large months" and the concave ones "small months." Then, excluding the thumb, starting from the second finger, we get January large, February small, March large, April small, May large, June small, July large. After counting to July, we have finished counting the knuckles. We return to the original place and get August large, September small, October large, November small, December large. Isn't this very easy to remember? However, everyone must also know that a large month has 31 days, a small month has 30 days, and only February has 28 days, or 29 days in a leap year.</p>
<p>Third, let's talk about leap years. We already know that the time it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun once is called a year, and its actual number of days is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds. Therefore, if we take 365 days as the length of a year, then each year is 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds shorter than the actual time it takes for the Earth to orbit. After four years, the difference is 23 hours, 15 minutes, and 4 seconds, which is less than a day. Therefore, we add an extra day every four years, called a leap year. But 23 hours, 15 minutes, and 4 seconds is less than a day, which is 44 minutes and 56 seconds less than a day. So every four years we add an extra day, which is 44 minutes and 56 seconds more than the actual time the Earth needs. That is an average of 11 minutes and 14 seconds more per year. After 400 years, the difference is about 3 days, 2 hours, 53 minutes, and 20 seconds. Therefore, once every 100 years, we must skip a leap year, that is, 100 years or multiples of 100 years are not leap years, but 400 years or multiples of 400 years are still leap years. This is the method of setting leap years in the current Gregorian calendar. However, skipping three leap years every 400 years leaves a remainder of 2 hours, 53 minutes, and 20 seconds. After more than 3,200 years, there will still be a difference of one day. Therefore, we must skip another leap day every 3,000 years to compensate for it. Since the current calendar has only been in effect for 400 years, this error does not have a significant impact yet. Since we already know the method of setting leap months, we can predict which year should be a leap year and which year should be a normal year. Its method is very simple and very easy to remember. Its method is: "Add 1911 to the number of years in the Republic of China era. If the result can be divided by 4, then this year is a leap year. If it cannot be divided, then it is a normal year. However, if it is a multiple of 100, even if it can be divided by 4, it is still a normal year; if it is a multiple of 100 and also a multiple of 400, then the year is still a leap year."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that this year is the 24th year of the Republic of China, which is 1935 in the Gregorian calendar. If we use the Gregorian calendar year to remember leap years or normal years, it is simpler, that is, we don't have to add 1911. Now I will give a few examples. (1) This year is the 24th year of the Republic of China. Add 24 to 1911 to get 1935. Divide it by 4 to get 483, and there are 3 left over, which means it cannot be divided by 4, so this year is a normal year, which means February has 28 days. (2) Next year is the 25th year of the Republic of China. Add 25 to 1911 to get 1936. Divide it by 4 to get 484, which means it can be divided by 4, so next year is a leap year, which means February will have 29 days. (3) Suppose we want to find out whether the 189th year of the Republic of China is a leap year or a normal year? We can add 189 to 1911 to get 2100. Divide it by 100 to get 21. Divide it by 400 to get 5, and there are 100 left over. Since it is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, it is a normal year. (4) Suppose we want to find out whether the 89th year of the Republic of China is a leap year or a normal year? We add 89 to 1911 to get 2000. It is 20 times 100 and also 5 times 400, so it is a leap year.</p>
<p>From the above four examples, we know that the current Gregorian calendar's method of setting leap years only adds one day to February, and it is very simple to know which year is a leap year and which year is a normal year.</p>
<p>Fourth, in terms of solar terms, there is currently a most unreasonable and most powerful opposition argument in society, which is that the new calendar does not pay attention to solar terms, which is inconvenient for farmers. This is a big mistake. The 24 solar terms are indeed unique to China. Foreign countries only talk about the four points of the spring equinox, autumn equinox, summer solstice, and winter solstice. However, the current Gregorian calendar we use does adopt the foreign calendar, but we must know that this calendar is based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun as the standard. In other words, it is based on the Sun's northward and southward movement as the standard. And the method of determining the 24 solar terms, as mentioned above, is determined according to the position of the Sun, that is, the position of the Sun on the ecliptic. Every 15 degrees is called a solar term. Therefore, in the current Gregorian calendar, the date of the solar term in each month is almost fixed, because the current month divides the year into twelve months, and it is not based on the time it takes for the Moon to orbit the Earth once as a month. Therefore, each month has an average of two solar terms, and its date is almost fixed. If you don't believe it, please list a table of the dates of the 24 solar terms from the first year of the Republic of China to the 24th year according to the old calendar and the current Gregorian calendar (table omitted) and you will know which calendar is suitable for remembering the solar terms. Now I will take the spring equinox and the winter solstice as examples. In these 25 years, the spring equinox fell on March 21st twenty-three times and on March 22nd twice. The winter solstice fell on December 22nd eighteen times and on December 23rd seven times. In short, they differ by only one or two days. However, according to the old lunar calendar, the date of the spring equinox was February 3rd in the first year of the Republic of China, February 14th in the second year, February 25th in the third year, and February 7th in the fourth year, with no fixed date. The date of the winter solstice was November 14th in the first year of the Republic of China, November 25th in the second year, November 7th in the third year, and November 17th in the fourth year, also with no fixed date. This is just an example of the spring equinox and the winter solstice. The other solar terms are the same. Now, please prepare a pencil and a piece of white paper. I will read the solar term dates for next year, which is the 25th year of the Republic of China, to you. You can write them down. That is:</p>
<p>Minor Cold January 6th Great Cold January 21st</p>
<p>Start of Spring February 5th Rain Water February 20th</p>
<p>Awakening of Insects March 6th Spring Equinox March 21st</p>
<p>Pure Brightness April 5th Grain Rain April 20th</p>
<p>Start of Summer May 6th Grain Full May 21st</p>
<p>Grain in Ear June 6th Summer Solstice June 21th</p>
<p>Minor Heat July 7th Great Heat July 23rd</p>
<p>Start of Autumn August 8th End of Heat August 23rd</p>
<p>White Dew September 8th  Autumnal Equinox September 23rd</p>
<p>Cold Dew October 8th  Frost's Descent October 23rd</p>
<p>Start of Winter November 7th Minor Snow November 22nd</p>
<p>Major Snow December 7th  Winter Solstice December 22nd</p>
<p>Although the above is the solar term date for next year, we can treat it as permanent, which is not impossible, because the annual solar term date is almost the same, at most one day earlier or one day later than the dates written above. From the above, we can also know that each month has two solar terms, the first half of the year is always around the 6th and 21st, and the second half of the year is always around the 8th and 23rd. According to the twelve segments and twelve nodes, all the segments in the first half of the year are around the 5th and 6th, and all the segments in the second half of the year are around the 7th and 8th. All the nodes in the first half of the year are around the 20th and 21st, and all the nodes in the second half of the year are around the 22nd and 23rd. From the above, we can know that the reasons opposed by the farmers in the countryside are completely wrong. Mr. Zhang Xinyi of the Legislative Yuan once compiled a song of the 24 solar terms based on the above situation, which greatly benefits the farmers. If everyone can remember the above clearly, without looking at the calendar, they can know which year and which day each solar term falls on. This is the special benefit of the current Gregorian calendar for the 24 solar terms that the Chinese people value.</p>
<p>The above is about the benefits of the current Gregorian calendar from the calendar itself. Now, let's talk about its benefits in terms of social life, that is, the current Gregorian calendar has great convenience in international affairs, people's livelihood, budget, and agricultural affairs. First, in terms of international convenience, we all know that China's current position is often subject to foreign political and economic aggression. International negotiations are particularly important compared to other countries. And international trade and international exchanges are particularly complex compared to other countries. Using a unified year and month is the standard for essential letters and certificates and for calculating the time limit. The current Gregorian calendar we use is the most popular calendar in the world, so it is very convenient in international affairs. As for its convenience in people's livelihood and budget, that is something you have experienced yourself, so there is no need to explain it further. As for its convenience in agricultural affairs, that is about the certainty of solar term dates, which has been explained very clearly above, so there is no need to say it again.</p>
<p>In short, from the perspective of the three elements of the calendar - that is, year, month, and day - the current Gregorian calendar, although it destroys the meaning of the month, is indeed simpler, neater, and much more convenient than the old lunar calendar in other aspects. However, it has many shortcomings in itself, such as the length of the month ranging from 28 days to 31 days, the number of days in each season being different, and the days of the week in each month being unfixed. Under such circumstances, various problems of reform arise. But the current reform of the calendar does not have much responsibility in astronomy, because the determination of astronomical cycles has long been known in great detail. Most of the problems of reforming the calendar now belong to social, custom, or religious relations, so although the current Gregorian calendar has various benefits, it may still need to be reformed in the future due to social evolution.

<p>Mr. Du Huisheng Appointed to Attend at That Time, the Chamber of Commerce Federation Replied to the Commercial Department for Notification</p>
<p>The Industry News Agency reports that the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a letter from the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry yesterday, requesting notification of the appointment of personnel to participate in the U.S. Honolulu Business Conference. The Federation, considering that the Sino-American Trade Association had already appointed Mr. Du Huisheng, the president of the Honolulu Chinese Chamber of Commerce, as its representative, specially replied to the Commercial Department for notification yesterday. The two letters are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Letter from the Commercial Department: I have received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, forwarded by Minister Bu, stating that the Consulate General in Honolulu has reported that the Western Chamber of Commerce of the United States will convene a business conference in Honolulu from November 27th to 30th of this year, and the Chamber has requested that our country's chamber of commerce send personnel to participate. I request that you review the matter and reply. Respectfully, the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry. Attached is a copy of the letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the Consulate General in Honolulu has reported that the Western Chamber of Commerce of the United States will convene a meeting in Honolulu from November 27th to 30th, and its purpose is to connect merchants from the western provinces of the United States and the Pacific coast to jointly study American commerce, shipping, Pacific aviation, and foreign trade, as well as other important matters related to the United States and the international community. However, although this is not an international conference, American merchants are eager to take this opportunity to get closer to Eastern merchants and request that your government be notified to inform the Chamber of Commerce to send personnel to participate in the American Chamber of Commerce's meeting. Please review the matter and reply.</p>
<p>Letter from the Chamber of Commerce Federation: In reply to your letter No. 381 from the Commercial Department, regarding the notification of the appointment of personnel to participate in the U.S. Honolulu Business Conference, I have received your letter. I have checked the previous notice from the Sino-American Trade Association, which has already appointed Mr. Du Huisheng, the president of the Honolulu Chinese Chamber of Commerce, as its representative to attend the conference. I am replying to your department for your review, and I hope you will notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and telegraph the Consulate General in Honolulu, and also notify Mr. Du Huisheng to attend as a representative at that time. Respectfully, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Launched a Re-census Yesterday</h3>
<p>Distributing Survey Forms to be Filled Out According to the Format, Sending Personnel to Collect and Tabulate on the 19th</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to ascertain the exact population count of the city, launched a general re-census yesterday. Starting at 6:00 AM yesterday, the captains and vice-captains of each branch bureau and team supervised the team leaders and members to mobilize by district and distribute survey forms to each household. If they encountered people who were illiterate or unfamiliar with how to fill out the forms, the investigators provided detailed instructions. Hong Qi, the chief of the investigation team, and Li Zemin, the deputy chief, went to various districts to observe the implementation of the investigation. The work was very tense. It is reported that the survey forms that have been distributed will be collected and compiled by the bureau on the 19th of this month. If it is discovered that the information provided is false, or if people refuse to be investigated, or destroy the investigation, the bureau will impose a fine of between five and ten yuan, or detention of between five and ten days, in accordance with Article 24 of the newly promulgated Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Household Registration Investigation Regulations.</p>
<h3>The State-Owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Reduces Recurring Expenses</h3>
<p>The Fuzhou Branch Converted into an Office, Other Expenses Reduced by Two Million Per Year</p>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was nationalized, its operations have improved significantly. This year, the Yangtze River shipping business has been particularly prosperous. However, due to insufficient ships, the company has been unable to fully develop. For the past three years, its annual income has been sufficient to cover expenses. However, despite various plans, there is still no solution to the huge amount of debt it has accumulated over the years. The issuance of public bonds has been abandoned due to the lack of reliable guarantees, and the funds from the National Economic Council have also been fully allocated for the construction of roads and water conservancy projects. The Ministry of Communications itself has also not allocated any funds. As a result, the company faces the risk of financial strain due to the burden of huge debts and interest payments. Recently, the directors and supervisors of the company have been forced to submit their resignations. Although the Ministry of Communications has repeatedly urged them to stay, their attitudes remain very passive. The negotiations are still ongoing. The company's annual expenses are about ten million yuan, and even if they are reduced by 20%, it would only be two million yuan. However, its debt amounts to nearly thirty million yuan, and to implement plans and actively reorganize, ten million yuan is needed. The construction of ships and the repair of docks and warehouses require huge sums of money.</p>
<h3>The National Lawyers Association Petitions the Fifth National Congress</h3>
<p>Requesting the Immediate Promulgation of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law, Shen Junru and Chen Jizhi Have Gone to Nanjing</p>
<p>Although the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law, which was previously submitted by the National Lawyers Association to the Judicial Conference, has been passed and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan replied that it is still under review by the Criminal Law Committee. Fearing that it would be delayed, the Second Plenary Meeting of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee was held in Hangzhou County. It was decided to continue petitioning the Fifth National Congress, requesting that the legislative principles be decided immediately and that the National Government and the Legislative Yuan be instructed to formulate and promulgate the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law within a set period of time, in order to redress the grievances of the people and clarify the rule of law. In addition to telegraphing the lawyers' associations and the wrongful imprisonment compensation movements and branches across the country to appeal to the Fifth National Congress, it was also decided to appoint Shen Junru, Chen Zhigao, and Chen Dexin as committee members to go to Nanjing to meet with Liu Liumin (standing committee member of the association) and Chen Yaodong (secretary-general of the association) and Liu Zhe (president of the Capital Lawyers Association) to jointly go to the Central Party Headquarters, carry a petition, and request the Legislative Yuan to allow them to hold a meeting to discuss the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law. It is known that the above six members will be listed to attend the meeting and present their opinions. It is learned that Chen Dexin is unable to spare time due to his busy law practice in Hangzhou, while Shen Junru and Chen Zhifu, believing that the Fifth National Congress is currently in session and they should go there immediately, took the 11:00 PM train to Nanjing last night with the draft Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law. They will immediately meet with the committee members in Nanjing and jointly go to the Central Party Headquarters to petition the Fifth National Congress.</p>
<h3>The Bean Cake Manufacturers' Petition Representatives Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The National Grain and Oil Cake Manufacturers' Petition Delegation, including Gu Duiyi, Jiang Hongbin, Chen Ziyi, Cao Xingeng, Chen Yunqing, Chen Shaoming, Liu Liugu, Chen Shide, He Xianggu, Rao Dongming, Li Zhongchen, Li Peisheng, Chen Pinsheng, Ling Youqiao, Chen Jinzhi, and Shanghai Chamber of Commerce representative Zheng Zenan, Qingdao Chamber of Commerce representative Huang Hanchi, and others, took the overnight express train to Nanjing on the 12th of this month, petitioning the Fifth National Congress. They arrived in Nanjing at 7:15 AM the next day (the 13th) and immediately convened a meeting at their residence in Nanjing to discuss the petition procedures. On the 14th and 15th, they went to the Central Party Headquarters to petition the Congress, and visited Zou, a member of the Central Executive Committee, at the Lixing Society. The petition was very successful, and the representatives from various regions took the train back to Shanghai on the evening of the 15th, arriving in the city yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Petition Process The Dagong News Agency reporter visited Chen Ziyi, the standing committee member of the Shanghai Oil Mill Trade Association and a member of the petition delegation, yesterday to inquire about the petition process. According to him, on the morning of the 14th, all the representatives went to the Central Party Headquarters to present their petition to the Congress. The director of reception, Ye Shizhi, received them. The entire petition delegation believed that since the oil factories and carriers across the country stopped operations and transportation on September 1st, it has been more than two months. The livelihood of over 70,000 oil workers and the losses of the factories are indescribable. If the Congress does not concretely accept the intentions of the petition, the livelihood of our factory carriers and workers will be cut off. Therefore, the next morning (the 15th), the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Qingdao Chamber of Commerce, the Grain Association, and the Oil Factory Association jointly submitted an earnest request to the Congress Presidium. Fortunately, the Congress, out of concern for the people and the suffering of the manufacturers, specially decided to appoint Chairman Zhang Ji and Chairman Pan Gongzhan to receive them. The representatives explained in detail the unbearable burdens of donations and the difficulties of the manufacturers. Chairman Zhang and Chairman Pan agreed to bring it up for discussion at the Congress and ensure that the manufacturers' demands would be realized. They hoped that the representatives would persuade the manufacturers to resume operations and transportation first, and wait for the Congress to discuss and reply. The representatives were satisfied. After returning to their residence, they went to the Lixing Society again at 1:00 PM to visit Zou Haibin, the member of the Southwestern Political Affairs Committee and president of Zhongshan University, who also received them in person and gave earnest advice. Regarding the donation issue, in addition to the Congress accepting it for discussion, he personally promised to be responsible for negotiating with the authorities of the Southwestern Political Affairs Committee after returning to Guangdong, so that the manufacturers would not suffer losses. Therefore, this delegation expressed great satisfaction with this petition. The Shanghai and Qingdao Chambers of Commerce sent representatives to assist the petition, traveling tirelessly and doing their utmost. They expressed their utmost gratitude.</p>
<p>Waiting for Instructions Currently, the oil factories and carriers across the country have decided to wait for the Fifth National Congress to give instructions before deciding on the method of resuming operations and transportation. Among the petition delegation, the manufacturer representatives from Qingdao, Jinan, Shantou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places left Shanghai separately last night. The representatives in Shanghai are scheduled to convene a meeting of manufacturers next week to report on the progress of this petition.</p>
<h3>The Preparatory Committee for Issuance Held a Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday, Revising the Rules of Procedure. Xu Kan Visited Kong to Report. The Tobacco and Exchange Association Advised Fellow Traders Not to Hoard Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were legal tender, the Preparatory Committee for Issuance Management held a standing committee meeting yesterday to revise the rules of procedure and investigate the reserves of various issuing banks. The Tobacco and Exchange Association issued a notice to exchange for legal tender. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Standing Committee Meeting of the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for Issuance Management held a standing committee meeting at the Central Bank on the Bund at 11:30 AM yesterday. The attendees were standing committee members Hu Bijiang, Chen Guangfu, and Li Jue. Song Ziwen and Qian Xinzhi were absent. The draft committee member of the rules of procedure, Xu Kan, and Zhang Gongquan, attended. They discussed and revised the proposed rules of procedure article by article. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. Xu Kan then visited Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi to report on the progress of the standing committee meeting. The revised rules of procedure are still awaiting approval by the Congress.</p>
<p>Other Banks Gradually Recalling</p>
<p>In order to unify the issuance of currency, the committee sent members Ye Zhuotang and others to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Bank of Communications, the China Industrial Bank, the China Reclamation Bank, the Siming Bank, (i.e. Zhongnan), the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the China Farmers Bank, and the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank to investigate the issuance reserves. After completing the investigation, they have been taken over separately. The above banks will not be allowed to issue new banknotes in the future. All printed but unissued banknotes should be handed over to the Central Bank and gradually recalled at the same time. In the future, the currency circulating in the market will be the legal tender of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications.</p>
<p>Tobacco and Exchange Industry Advises Exchanging for Legal Tender</p>
<p>The Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association issued an urgent notice stating, "Regarding the announcement that the government has issued an order that all silver coins (i.e., silver dollars) will be discontinued from November 4th, and stipulates that they should be exchanged for legal tender at the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, our association has unanimously supported it. However, our fellow traders may have silver dollars in stock, or those accumulated through exchange should be exchanged for legal tender at the stipulated three banks as soon as possible to comply with the law. Do not be greedy for small profits and engage in private buying and selling, or hoard and refuse to exchange, intending to wait and see, so as not to fall into the legal net. In addition to the notice that has been distributed, I hope that my fellow traders will pay close attention and not mislead themselves. Fearing that it has not been fully informed, I am issuing another notice."</p>
<h3>China Aviation Corporation Awaits Ministry Orders to Comply; Sino-French Joint Flight Test</h3>
<p>Trial Flight for Three Months Before Formal Opening</p>
<p>Regarding the rumors of a Sino-French through-flight test flight within days, according to Huang Baoxian, director of the China Aviation Corporation's business group, speaking to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, the China Aviation Corporation has not yet received instructions from the Ministry of Communications. All Sino-French through-flight contracts were signed and determined by the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing in consultation with the French side. The company will comply with the orders. As for the trial flight, the company will dispatch a Chinese pilot to fly a Douglas aircraft, the Daoer Yu. The trial flight will also be determined after the official document arrives. The trial flight will depart from Shanghai to Guangzhou, and then first conduct a trial flight from Guangzhou to Hanoi, Annam. Once this line is completed, a trial flight will be conducted from Yunnan to Hanoi. The completion of these two lines will take about three months. The official opening of the route is scheduled for next spring.</p>
<h3>Sheshan Basilica of Our Lady Completed and Opened Today</h3>
<p>Archbishop Cai Ning Went Up the Mountain Yesterday to Attend the Ceremony</p>
<p>Sheshan is one of the nine peaks of Yun, a scenic spot in Jiangnan, located twenty miles north of Songjiang City and under the administration of Qingpu County. After the Taiping Rebellion, Catholic priests began to purchase land to build sanatoriums and churches on Zhongshan. In the spring of 1868, a hexagonal pavilion was built on the top of the mountain to honor the Blessed Virgin Mary. Two years later, the Tianjin Massacre occurred, and the Catholic followers in Jiangnan sought to avoid disaster and vowed to build a basilica on the top of the mountain. It was completed in the spring of 1873, and since then it has been a famous national pilgrimage site for Catholics. Fifty years later, with the number of pilgrims increasing daily, the church was unable to accommodate the crowds during the festivals, so funds were raised to rebuild a new-style basilica. A certain priest from Belgium, an expert in church architecture who had been preaching in Mongolia, was hired to design and draw the plans. Mr. Ye, a Portuguese architect in this city, was in charge of the construction. Since the start of construction, believers at home and abroad have enthusiastically donated money, and the progress has been smooth. However, the scale of the new church is grand, and it is located on a mountain peak hundreds of feet high, making it difficult to transport bricks and stones. After twelve years of painstaking efforts, it has finally been completed. The opening ceremony will be held at 8:00 AM this morning, and the first Mass will be held in the new church. The Bishop of Shanghai has arrived on the mountain ten days ago to fast and meditate in order to show his solemnity. Archbishop Cai Ning, the papal representative to China, flew to Shanghai from Fujian a few days ago and took a car to the mountain yesterday to attend the ceremony. Yan, the chief priest of Songjiang, believes that the national crisis is serious and does not want to overspend, so he only invited those who have helped to build the church to attend the ceremony, and prayed to the Blessed Virgin Mary for world peace with solemn religious rites. It is reported that the construction cost of the church has reached 500,000 yuan. After all the renovations are completed, a grand consecration ceremony will be held.</p>

He is scheduled to stay in Nanjing for a few days and then return to Shanghai. According to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter's investigation, Mr. Song's trip is to visit various central authorities, and the heads of various ministries, and related parties to discuss investment in domestic construction.

<p>Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Office of the China Aviation Association Solicitation Team's Aviation Patriotic Mobile Simple Exhibition opened on the 10th of this month at the People's Education Hall on Wenmiao Road in South Shanghai.

<h3>Chrysanthemum Competition to Aid Disaster Relief Concluded</h3>
<p>Madam Xu Shiying Participated in a Benefit Performance</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, acting on behalf of the victims of the disaster, has appealed for donations from all parties and has held various entertainment events to aid disaster relief in order to maximize relief efforts. It has been learned that the football disaster relief match held previously by the association in the city center and the chrysanthemum entertainment relief event held at the Xinxin Company have both concluded. In recent days, they have been rushing to complete the final arrangements. However, some sectors still have ticket fees that have not been submitted in time, preventing them from being finalized on time. In order to clear the procedures, the association has issued letters urging the submission of the football match ticket fees and the chrysanthemum competition entertainment ticket fees in order to collect and announce them. The original letter is transcribed below: "Dear Sir/Madam, Our association held a chrysanthemum disaster relief competition entertainment convention at the rooftop garden of the Xinxin Company from November 2nd to 4th in order to raise disaster relief donations and transfer the income for disaster relief purposes. We previously sent tickets for sale and distribution. The above ticket fees have not been received for many days. In order to expedite the conclusion and for the funds to be sent to the disaster areas for disaster relief, we are issuing a letter urging you to submit the ticket fees to the temporary office of the fundraising group of the Eight Immortals Overseas Youth Association on the third floor within three days of receiving this letter in order to clear the procedures. In addition, Ms. Meng Xiaodong and Ms. Zhang Eyun have gained support from all sides since their charity performances, and ticket sales have been excellent.

<h3>The Public Concession Police Authorities Established a Special Political Police Organization</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the incident involving the Japanese sailor on Rue Doumer, there have been many rumors in Shanghai. In order to avoid further misfortunes, the Public Concession police authorities recently established a special political police organization on the third floor of the Central Police Station on Simalu. It is staffed by skilled personnel from China, Britain, Japan, and India, and is headed by a Westerner named Robertson, with a Japanese named Uehara as his deputy.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Plans to Establish Second Overseas Chinese Paradise Village</h3>
<p>Site Selected in Wuhu, Xuan City's Neighboring County; Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau Explains Significance of Establishing Overseas Chinese Paradise Village</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, after establishing the first Overseas Chinese Paradise Village in Shuiyang, Bincheng, has considerably resolved the livelihood issues of unemployed returned overseas Chinese. Furthermore, it has been able to develop inland wasteland. Therefore, there were plans to select sites in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces for establishment. However, due to limited funds, these plans did not come to fruition. Recently, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has selected several acres of wasteland in Wuhu, a county neighboring Xuan City, intending to purchase and develop it into the second Overseas Chinese Paradise Village. According to an official from the local Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, the government's establishment of Overseas Chinese Paradise Villages is not to encourage overseas Chinese to return, but to solve the livelihood problems of unemployed returned overseas Chinese who have nowhere else to turn. Recently, many returned overseas Chinese have misunderstood this meaning, which should be clarified in the newspapers, he said.</p>
<h3>Two Elementary Schools Donate Relief Funds and Clothing</h3>
<p>Mr. Qi Yiying, the principal of Da Ren Elementary School in Hanyang Village, Connaught Road, sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Permanent Disaster Relief in Various Provinces, stating, "We have sent five packages of donated items, including 77 pieces of clothing, 9 pairs of shoes, and 7 pairs of socks, along with 11 silver dollars. Please check and accept them, and we hope you will remit them to the disaster areas." Although education in our country is not yet universal, the number of schools established by both public and private entities is already considerable. If all schools could be as public-spirited and enthusiastic in providing relief as this school, the benefits to the disaster victims would be even greater. Additionally, the North District Elementary School, established by the Municipal Council on Kenning Road near the North Railway Station, sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces on Yunnan Road, stating, "The floods in the country are severe, and our compatriots in the disaster areas are in urgent need of relief. The faculty and staff of our school have each donated from their salaries, which has been submitted to the Relief Association by the Municipal Council. The students of the entire school also organized a disaster area children's relief group last month, raising a total of 122.3 silver dollars over the past month. They have also donated 912 pieces of old clothing and pants, and 298 pieces of hats, socks, shoes, etc., which are now being sent to your association for verification and distribution to our compatriots in the disaster areas. Please also announce the receipt of these funds and items in the newspapers." This demonstrates that schools established by foreigners are also deeply concerned about the floods in our country, which is admirable. It is hoped that schools established by our own country will also provide even more enthusiastic relief.</p>

A discussion was held on how to investigate and penalize them. The district chiefs will investigate and submit their findings to the county for review and handling. (2) The training of Bao chiefs in the county has now been completed. However, each district has submitted requests for exemptions for Bao chiefs and those with excessive absences from class who should have their certificates revoked. A discussion was held on when to schedule the examination. (Resolution) The examination will be scheduled for 1:00 PM on December 1st. (3) According to an order from the Department of Civil Affairs promulgating temporary measures for the construction of public foundations in various counties and cities in the province, people are no longer allowed to purchase arable land for burial. A discussion was held on how to plan for public cemeteries in each district, township, and town. Each district will instruct the township and town chiefs to investigate suitable locations and plan for them in accordance with the law. (4) It was found that the township and town Baojia chiefs in each district not only failed to earnestly implement compulsory literacy education and schools, but also arbitrarily obstructed progress. It was proposed that each district chief convene their subordinate township and town Bao chiefs on a regular basis to provide detailed guidance, and that the county magistrate be notified in advance to personally attend and speak to facilitate progress. (Resolution) The Second District will schedule it for 2:00 PM on November 18th, the Fifth District for 11:00 AM on November 24th, and the Fourth District for 3:00 PM on November 24th. The First and Third Districts will schedule it after each district chief sets a date and report it to the county magistrate, who will personally attend and speak on the scheduled date.</p>
<h3>First Siamese Commercial Envoy to China</h3>
<p>Mr. William Oliphant Departs Shanghai for Hong Kong; Departure of Siamese Study Mission Postponed</p>
<p>According to the China Eastern News Agency, following the anti-Chinese incident in Siam, which aroused resentment among the Chinese people, the Siamese government, in order to adjust Sino-Siamese relations, specially dispatched Interior Minister Prince Liang Butra and Siamese State Council Secretary Mr. William Oliphant to Europe last month. They came to China via Japan, separately visiting Chinese diplomatic authorities and business leaders to conduct consultations and sign a commercial treaty. A reporter from the China Eastern News Agency learned from overseas Chinese organizations that the Siamese government has now decided to appoint Mr. William Oliphant as the first Siamese Commercial Envoy to China, stationed permanently in China, responsible for guiding the development of Sino-Siamese commerce, with an office in Hong Kong. Mr. Oliphant departed Shanghai for Hong Kong a few days ago to prepare everything. Regarding the negotiations and signing of the Sino-Siamese commercial treaty, a spokesperson from the Foreign Affairs Office told the reporter from the China Eastern News Agency that the Siamese side has not yet provided any official diplomatic documents. Furthermore, the Chinese study mission to Siam, after the appointment of Mr. Ling Bing and Mr. Lin Kanghou as the chief and deputy leaders, respectively, had already completed the preparatory work and originally planned to depart soon. However, because some members of the mission are also members of the Central Committee and have been busy attending the Fifth National Congress, the departure has been delayed. It is necessary to wait until after the Fifth National Congress concludes before convening a meeting of the mission members to finalize everything. Therefore, the departure date will be postponed to early next month.</p>

<h3>Young Vagrants Raise Funds Under the Guise of National Salvation Army</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life mingle, both good and bad. Deceptive schemes are often heard of. In the British and French concessions of this city, three or four young vagrants wearing tattered training clothes or military uniforms have recently been found, holding donation books with the words "National Salvation Army Raising Military Funds" written on them. Yesterday, these people were seen on Route Doumer and Route Grouchy in the French Concession, soliciting donations from door to door. Those who refused were met with rude remarks, and many were deceived.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday issued a notice to opium smokers, stating that those found selling private soil, opening opium dens, or using licenses to allow others to smoke will be handed over to the Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<p>In the midst of the city's strict ban on opium, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has repeatedly urged those selling private soil, opening opium dens, or using licenses to allow others to smoke opium to stop. However, recent rigorous investigations by the bureau have revealed that the aforementioned activities still occur from time to time. To thoroughly eliminate these activities, the bureau will conduct strict searches starting immediately. Once discovered, offenders will be handed over to the city's military judicial organs for punishment in accordance with the temporary regulations for the punishment of opium-related crimes issued by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. However, as the military judicial organs should be designated by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission in accordance with the law, the bureau has now submitted a request to the municipal government and, upon receiving instructions from the municipal government, will hand over opium offenders found selling private soil, opening opium dens, or using licenses to allow others to smoke to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for trial and strict legal punishment, without leniency. The notice to opium smokers is as follows: The city's opium prohibition work has reached the stage of compulsory registration. The bureau has begun investigation work. Opium smokers found unregistered will be arrested and fined from 50 to 300 yuan in accordance with opium prohibition laws, and then ordered to register. Within this compulsory registration period, there is no possibility of voluntarily requesting registration. However, in order to give opium smokers a chance to reform, the bureau has drafted flexible measures and submitted them to the municipal government for approval, and has issued a notice stating that during the compulsory registration period, opium smokers are still allowed to surrender themselves. Opium smokers who have not registered may request registration from the bureau or its branches and police stations in the near future to avoid punishment. Those who still try to avoid registration and delay surrendering themselves will be punished in accordance with regulations once they are discovered by the bureau, with no leniency. Starting immediately, the bureau will send personnel to conduct strict investigations. All unregistered opium smokers who wish to avoid arrest and severe punishment should quickly come forward to register themselves. As for those selling private soil, opening opium dens, or using licenses to allow others to smoke, the bureau has repeatedly sent personnel to advise them to stop. However, according to recent investigations, the aforementioned activities are still being discovered. In order to thoroughly eliminate these activities, the bureau will also conduct strict searches starting immediately. Once discovered, offenders will be handed over to the city's military judicial organs for punishment in accordance with the temporary regulations for the punishment of opium-related crimes issued by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters has already issued a notice regarding these regulations, which the citizens should have seen. As for the military judicial organs, they should be designated by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission in accordance with the law. Before such designation, the bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to temporarily hand over opium cases that the bureau cannot handle to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for trial. Those who traffic in private soil and open opium dens should understand that the opium prohibition laws are strict and know to be cautious. Therefore, the bureau sincerely advises unregistered opium smokers to quickly surrender and register themselves with the bureau or its branches, without further delay. Those who do not smoke opium themselves should not falsely obtain licenses to allow others to smoke. As for those who sell private soil and open opium dens, they should quickly realize their errors and seek other legitimate occupations, and not be greedy for small profits, resulting in severe punishment. This is what the bureau earnestly hopes for.</p>

<h3>Municipal Federation Sends Letter to Municipal Council Opposing Metered Telephone Charges; Convenes Joint Meeting of Various Organizations and Requests Chinese Directors to Attend and Report</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to Mr. Frederick Fernie, the Acting Secretary-General of the Municipal Council yesterday regarding the issue of opposing metered telephone charges, requesting that it be submitted to the Board of Directors for reconsideration. It also sent letters to the five Chinese Directors of the Municipal Council and various important organizations in the city, scheduling a joint meeting to discuss methods of opposition. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Council: With regards to the telephone issue, the Federation has repeatedly written to the Council, expressing its absolute disagreement with the metered charging method. Now, the research report of the Telephone Experts Research Committee still adopts this metered charging method that violates the public opinion of the citizens, which the Federation deeply regrets. This method is both out of line with public sentiment and inconsistent with the facts, because the method by which the telephone company itself calculates the number of calls is not clear and accurate. For example, the bills for the number of calls made to the Ministry of Communications' telephone bureau have often caused disputes. If this method is implemented, it is feared that the telephone company's inflated extra charges will inevitably arouse great resentment among users. In addition to scheduling a joint meeting of various organizations for discussion, this letter is sent in advance, hoping that the Council will submit it to the Board of Directors for serious consideration and careful research. It must be known that public anger is difficult to offend, and public opinion is difficult to violate. To Mr. Frederick Fernie, Acting Secretary-General of the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Letter to Various Organizations: The Shanghai Telephone Company, disregarding the fact that telephones are a public utility, insisted on advocating a 1% official interest rate and suddenly proposed a price increase method. Various organizations in the city have repeatedly opposed it without effect. Subsequently, the Municipal Council hired telephone experts from four countries to come to Shanghai for research. However, they did not investigate the city's situation in detail, but still aimed to benefit the company, preparing a report that has been approved by the Municipal Council's Board of Directors and will be implemented in March next year. The Federation believes that this method is very unfair. After discussion by the Executive Committee, it was decided to hold a joint meeting of various organizations at 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss the method. You are hereby requested to send two representatives with a letter to attend at that time and jointly discuss the proceedings. This is earnestly hoped for.</p>
<p>Letter to Various Chinese Directors: Regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's request for a price increase, the Municipal Council hired experts from China, Britain, the United States, and Japan to come to Shanghai and form a Research Committee, which has prepared a report that has been approved by the Board of Directors. However, the content is very unfair, still using one-sided reasons, only caring about the company's 1% official interest rate, and not paying attention to the points requested by the citizens of the entire city. The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council did not investigate and approved it. The Federation, as a citizens' organization, finds it difficult to accept this method. After discussion by the 7th Executive Committee meeting, it was decided to convene a joint meeting of various organizations in the city at 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss countermeasures. You are hereby requested to attend and report on the process of the Board of Directors passing this case. This is earnestly hoped for.</p>

<h3>Winter Seasonal Winds Severely Hit Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The climate has already turned cold.</p>
<p>Starting the night before, a fierce windstorm struck the Shanghai area, with unusual intensity. Rain also fell intermittently, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, causing the climate to suddenly turn cold. According to a report yesterday morning from a Xinhua News Agency reporter to the Xujiahui Observatory, this windstorm is actually a winter trade wind. Due to the extremely cold weather and high air pressure in the Russia area recently, the wind is blowing southward. The wind force today is about force five, with a wind speed of about thirty kilometers per hour, and the wind direction is north-northwest. This kind of winter trade wind should not be compared with a hurricane. After Shanghai was hit by this trade wind, the climate has gradually turned cold. The temperature was still 50 degrees Fahrenheit around 5:00 AM this morning, but by 11:00 AM it had dropped to 48 degrees Fahrenheit. If the climate gets colder, there is hope that the weather in Shanghai may clear up. It is noted that the highest temperature in Shanghai the day before was 62.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest was 58.1 degrees Fahrenheit, which is a difference of more than one degree compared to noon yesterday. Also, the hurricane that newly arose in the Pacific Ocean on the 12th of this month is currently in the northeast of Little Luzon Island, at 14 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude. It is still difficult to determine whether it will hit Shanghai. Because Shanghai is blowing northeast winds, a huge tide suddenly rose in the Huangpu River, reaching eleven feet one inch at 3:25 PM on the 15th, almost two feet higher than the predicted nine feet one inch two. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the measured level was nine feet three inches five, two feet nine inches seven higher than the predicted six feet three inches eight, causing considerable inconvenience to ships sailing in the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General Warns Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Do not believe rumors, live and work in peace. Severe punishment for spreading rumors.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported that Consul General Ishiya issued the following warning to Japanese residents today: "In recent weeks, various unstable rumors have arisen in the Zhabei area, leading to unrest among residents. These rumors are actually deliberately fabricated by speculators in an attempt to achieve profitable purposes. Coinciding with the recent sniper attack on our marine corps members, unfounded claims have been spread wildly, saying that Japan has issued an ultimatum to China, or that preparations for war have begun. As a result, ignorant people in Zhabei, lacking common sense, have flocked into the concessions, and social order has suddenly become unusually chaotic. This sense of unease has a major impact on maintaining law and order, and the unease among Chinese residents inevitably affects Japanese residents as well. Therefore, my fellow residents, do not be misled by rumors, and live and work in peace. If residents spread irresponsible rumors, the authorities will severely crack down and will not show leniency."</p>
<h3>After the Bankruptcy of Ming Hua Bank, Yesterday's Meeting of Creditors</h3>
<p>Held at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. Another meeting scheduled to elect supervisors.</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, after Ming Hua Bank was adjudicated bankrupt by the court and accountants Liu Dajun and lawyer Zhang Zhirang were appointed as bankruptcy administrators to take over from the former liquidator, accountant Xie Lin, the first meeting of creditors was convened at the YMCA on Sichuan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Creditors present at the meeting: Yesterday, there were more than fifty representatives of creditors, including Wang Jian'e and Le Junfen from Shanghai, and Guo Dingsen from Tianjin, with a total debt amount of 232,000 yuan (the amount already registered is 329,000 yuan). Judge Yu Lüde of the First Special District Court and bankruptcy administrators Liu Dajun and Zhang Zhirang served as chairmen. After announcing the opening of the meeting, Judge Yu Lüde first reported the purpose of convening the creditors' meeting. Next, accountant Liu Dajun reported on the takeover from the former liquidator, and then reported on the assets and liabilities of the Ming Hua Bank's general management office and the commercial, savings, and lottery departments of the Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, and Qingdao branches.</p>
<p>Meeting details: Finally, creditor representatives Guo Dingsen, Wang Jian'e, and Le Junfen spoke successively, which can be divided into four points: (1) Since there were no creditor representatives from Qingdao and Beiping at today's creditors' meeting, for the sake of prudence, the election of supervisors should be postponed. (2) The act of Qingdao and Beiping branches privately conducting coordination with local creditors should be revoked according to law, and the administrators should promptly take over all their assets from the branches. (3) The registered capital of the bank with the Ministry of Finance does not match, and it should be recovered according to law. (4) According to Article 122 of the Bankruptcy Law, the bank's directors and supervisors should be ordered to attend the creditors' meeting. The chairman accepted the opinions of the creditor representatives, and another meeting was scheduled to convene the second creditors' meeting and re-elect supervisors. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Goods Company: Employee Wage Claim Lawsuit Resolved</h3>
<p>The company will pay compensation separately.</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, according to an employee of the Shanghai National Goods Company, the lawsuit between the employees and the company over claiming wages and savings has been resolved, and the company will pay compensation separately. All the goods previously attached by the court will remain in the company's possession.</p>
<h3>Two Thugs Murdered Tang en route</h3>
<p>Qu Jinshan is highly suspected. Xue Zhao escaped unharmed, but his wife died.</p>
<p>Xue Zhao, a native of Funing, living at No. 17 Wu'an Lane, Rihui East Road, Nanshi, is 41 years old and engaged in the yellow sand and gravel business. His first wife died early, and he remarried Tang, a woman from Yancheng, as his second wife through an introduction. They lived together in the same house, and the couple was considered harmonious. Qu Jinshan (age 41), a Yancheng native who ran a vegetable business, rented a house in Jin Yun Lane No. 3, not far from Xue's house. He saw that Tang looked quite beautiful and tried to seduce her. He entrusted Zhou Gu, a woman from Funing, to arrange a meeting. Soon, they engaged in an affair more than once. Xue was completely unaware. In July of this year, Qu and Tang had a secret rendezvous, which Xue happened to stumble upon. Xue did not make a scene, only summoned Tang home and gave her advice. Tang stopped communicating with Qu. Unexpectedly, Qu insisted on having Zhou Gu persuade Xue Zhao to let Tang marry Qu, who was willing to provide Xue with some money, allowing Xue to remarry. However, Xue and Tang firmly refused. Qu harbored resentment and repeatedly threatened them. Xue dismissed it with a smile and never took precautions. Around 12 o'clock the night before, Xue and his wife Tang were listening to a story in the Shunxing Teahouse. As they left and walked home on Dapu Road, they suddenly encountered two men dressed in black, who jumped out from the roadside and blocked Xue and his wife. They took out sharp daggers and were about to stab Xue. Fortunately, Tang had seen them early and rushed forward to grab the thugs. Xue, fearing harm, took the opportunity to flee. The two thugs vented their anger on Tang, slashing off the five fingers of her left hand and stabbing her head, both arms, back, and other places, causing six or seven injuries in total. Tang fell into a pool of blood, barely breathing. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled. The nearby police heard the commotion and rushed to investigate. At the same time, Xue also arrived and rushed Tang to the hospital for treatment. She died around 4:00 AM yesterday morning due to excessive blood loss. Xue Zhao then went to the Ximen Branch to report that the deceased Tang was his second wife. She had been introduced to Qu Jinshan by Zhou Gu, leading to an affair. After he advised Tang, they broke off contact. Qu threatened to harm them, so he secretly sent thugs to ambush and kill his wife. He requested the arrest and investigation of the criminals. Director Yao of the branch, considering it a murder case, ordered a report to be submitted to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Transporting Iron Barrels Causes Broken Wheel: Head Crushed into a Meat Pie</h3>
<p>A rickshaw head underestimated his ability, sacrificing a life for six hundred cash.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Brewery Company recently expanded its land to build a new factory on Yichang Road. After its completion, the sixty iron barrels for storing beer in the old factory on Gordon Road were contracted to the Liyuan Construction Company, which built the new factory, for relocation and installation. However, Yang Yinhai, the local engineer of the brewery, believed that the distance between the new and old factories was only a few dozen storefronts, and that although each iron barrel weighed two tons, the task was easy. Therefore, he subcontracted the transportation and installation project from Liyuan, agreeing on a total transportation and installation fee of 25 yuan per barrel. Yang initially planned to transport them by truck, but the truck companies charged 10 yuan per barrel just for transportation, without taking responsibility for installation, which he considered too expensive. Therefore, he hired Qiu Rongsheng, a rickshaw head from Tongzhou living at No. 78 Yade Road, to transport them, requiring only a transportation fee of 5 yuan per barrel. However, the rickshaw office had limited the load-carrying capacity of rickshaws to one ton, while each iron barrel weighed two tons. This heavy task was beyond the capacity of wooden rickshaws. Qiu, eager for quick profit, disregarded the potential danger. The day before yesterday morning, he sent rickshaw pullers Wei Changgui, Wang Songsheng, Zhou Hongji, Zhang Xishun, Wang Dachang, and more than ten porters to the old factory on Gordon Road to transport these heavy iron barrels. These barrels were placed inside the factory, so they had to be loaded onto the rickshaws inside the factory. Yang Yinhai used a crane to lift the barrels into the air and then slowly placed them on the rickshaws. The rickshaw pullers then pulled the rickshaws out of the factory, down the steps outside the factory, and onto the road. As the rickshaw descended, the weight on the rickshaw was unevenly distributed, and the wooden axles were already rotten, making them unable to bear the heavy load. With a crash, the front wheel broke, and the round iron barrel on the rickshaw fell and rolled down. The rickshaw pullers were unable to stop it and ran to avoid it. Wei Changgui alone was unable to escape and was knocked down. The iron barrel rolled over his head, crushing his skull into a meat pie, with brain matter and blood gushing out. The sight was too gruesome to bear. According to the rickshaw pullers and porters, Qiu had agreed to pay each of them 600 cash per barrel. Unexpectedly, this accident occurred as soon as they started transporting, and Wei sacrificed his life for the price of 600 cash. When the police in charge heard the report, they immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene of the accident for investigation. In addition to carrying Wei's body to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road, they arrested Qiu and Yang, who were both held responsible, and took them to the police station for detention. The barrel-transporting operation was also temporarily suspended. Yesterday morning, the police sent Qiu and Yang to the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, accused them of negligent homicide under Article 276 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Liu Yugui summoned the remaining rickshaw pullers, Wang Songsheng and others, to inquire about the circumstances of the accident, he ordered the two defendants to be returned to custody. The prosecutor, Song Genshan, accompanied by a forensic doctor, went to the forensic examination office to examine Wei Changgui's body and ordered Wang Dachang, a friend of the deceased, to provide a guarantee to hand over the body for coffining and burial, pending legal action.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Accident at the Intersection of Xinzha Road and Xinzha Bridge Road</h3>
<p>Clerk from the Bank of China Injured: Bicycle Destroyed, Anus Bone Crushed</p>
<p>At the intersection of Xinzha Road and Xinzha Bridge Road in the Public Concession, at about 11:10 AM yesterday, a route 10 public bus was traveling east to west. The left side of the road was under repair, and it was also a tram station for three tram lines. As the public bus approached, there was a rickshaw pulling a passenger in front of it, turning from Xinzha Bridge Road towards Xinzha Bridge. The public bus driver initially intended to avoid the rickshaw, but when he turned the bus head to the right side of the road, it crashed directly into the back of a bicycle ridden by a clerk from the Xinzha branch of the Bank of China. At that time, the bicycle was also in front of the public bus, and both were traveling from east to west. Because the public bus was traveling at high speed, especially as the bicycle was only separated from the entrance of the branch by Xinzha Bridge Road, the public bus caught up from behind and with a crash, the rear wheel of the bicycle was crushed into two pieces by the front wheel of the public bus. The clerk fell to the road, and the wheel of the public bus ran over the area between his thighs. After the accident, the police arrived, recorded the number and name of the public bus driver, and called the fire department to send an ambulance. The branch of the Bank of China also sent staff to send the injured person to Zhubaolong Hospital. After examination by the doctor, it was found that the anus bone had been crushed, and there was a risk to his life. It was also learned that recently, due to the high volume of traffic in the area, two men and women were also injured in accidents between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, and were taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment.</p>
<h3>Ma Jinshan Robbed a Necklace and Killed a Person</h3>
<p>Seventeen-year-old youth with a cruel heart: Prosecutor confirmed the arrest for interrogation.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhixian, a resident of a shack in Zhoujia Bridge, west of Wusong Town, from Taixian, Jiangbei, recently returned to his hometown for some business. His wife, Zhou Chou, and their son and daughter stayed behind. The son, Gui Lin, is eight years old and wears a silver necklace. The day before yesterday, Gui Lin was idly gazing at the fields nearby when he was suddenly encountered by Ma Jinshan, a neighbor from the same hometown (age seventeen). Seeing that no one was around, Ma Jinshan had malicious intentions and stepped forward to snatch the necklace. Gui Lin refused, which angered Ma, who used a cloth rope to strangle Gui Lin to death. He then took the necklace and sold it to Baocheng Silver Shop on Songxing Road for three yuan and six jiao, which he spent. Later, Gui Lin's mother searched for Gui Lin and discovered that he had been murdered and the necklace had been robbed. She reported the crime to the police, who recovered the stolen item and identified Ma Jinshan as the perpetrator. Ma was arrested, and the local police were ordered to report to the local court for examination. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, accompanied by examiner Shen, arrived at the scene to confirm that the deceased child, Zhou Gui Lin, had indeed been strangled to death. They filled out the death certificate, ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial, and yesterday the child agency reported the criminal Ma Jinshan to the Third Research Institute for interrogation. His statement was evasive, and it was ordered to prepare a document to transfer him to the District Court Procuratorate for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Preparations for the Formation of the Released Prisoners Protection Association by Various Groups</h3>
<p>At the spring members' meeting of the Shanghai Bar Association this year, member Song Shixiang and more than twenty others submitted a proposal to organize a Released Prisoners Protection Association. At that time, the meeting decided to refer it to the executive supervisory committee to discuss the measures, believing that it was necessary to contact the local judicial authorities and public organizations for joint discussion. It once convened a joint meeting of local judicial authorities, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Certified Public Accountants Association, the Taxpaying Chinese Association, and other organizations. The meeting decided to appoint the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Certified Public Accountants Association, the Shanghai Bar Association, and other organizations to be responsible for preparations, and drafted articles of association and detailed rules. It is now learned that the Shanghai Bar Association has found that the Ningbo Yinxian Bar Association, in accordance with the notice issued by the Ministry of Justice and Administration on rescuing released prisoners and safeguarding groups (the original notice is recorded below), organized and established a Released Prisoners Protection Association in 1932, and the results were quite good. Now the association has decided to refer to the methods of the Released Prisoners Protection Association organized by the Qin County Bar Association to prepare articles of association and detailed rules. Once the draft is prepared, it will invite various organizations to discuss the methods of implementation. The previous notice issued by the Ministry of Justice and Administration is recorded below: For the purpose of the notice, it is found that prisons focus on reforming and implementing education, originally hoping that people released after serving their sentences will know how to repent and will not return to a life of crime. However, released prisoners often lack assistance and have no way to make a living, resulting in many people re-entering prison. Local people and various organizations in various countries generally have organizations to protect released prisoners, introduce them to jobs, ensure their safety, and prevent them from falling back into the clutches of the law, in order to ensure social safety. Our country originally had regulations on work rewards for prisoners in prison to subsidize the lives of released prisoners. Regarding Released Prisoners Protection Associations, there are still not many. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will organize them. If there is one more good citizen in a locality, there will be one less criminal in prison. The future of prison administration will rely on this. This notice is hereby issued.</p>

Recently, she has been in love with a man in the lane, and people have been gossiping.

<h3>After Nine Years of Separation, a Couple Came to Shanghai and Filed a Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Madam Liang Yang Accuses Her Husband of Abandonment</p>
<p>Liang Taikun, a man from Guangdong in his thirties, originally lived in Daling Township, Zhongshan County, Guangdong. Seven or eight years ago, he married Yang, a woman from the same township. Not long after the marriage, Liang left for Shanghai for business. About two years later, he returned to his hometown once. Soon after, he left for Shanghai again. Since then, Liang has not returned home for nine years. Yang has been living alone and did not know that her husband had found a new love. Recently, Yang, longing for her husband, came to Shanghai from Guangdong with her brother Yang Shizhong on August 29th of this year. Not knowing Liang's address, she went to Liang's workplace to see him. Unexpectedly, Liang rebuked Yang, saying that she should not have come to Shanghai rashly without prior notice. Yang endured it, fearing that something unexpected might happen. However, Liang, knowing that Yang's arrival in Shanghai was detrimental to him, changed his tone and specially invited Yang, Yang Shizhong, his cousin Yang Bingyao, and Liang's brother Zhong to dine at Dasanyuan Restaurant on Nanjing Road. During the meal, they negotiated with each other, but ultimately broke down due to both sides' unwillingness to compromise. Overwhelmed with grief and indignation, Yang lamented that her husband was too heartless. She hired lawyer Da Jue to file a lawsuit with the First Court in accordance with Article 294 of the Criminal Law, accusing Liang Taikun of abandoning his wife and accusing Liang Zhong of inciting the abandonment. The court approved the lawsuit, and the two defendants were summoned to the Criminal Division One yesterday morning. Presiding Judge Feng Shide summoned both parties to appear in court on time. However, as the time had passed noon, he ordered that the hearing be adjourned until Friday afternoon of next week.</p>

<h3>歐陽舜英 Sues Du Lu et al. for Forging a Will</h3>
<p>Xiamen Court Investigation Certifies it as Handwriting; Lawyers Engage in Fierce Mutual Attacks in Court</p>
<p>Lu Xingyuan, who formerly served as President of the Provisional Court and the Court of Appeals and is now practicing law in Shanghai, was invited by Wang Yao臣, a Xiamen native who had intended to become a French citizen, on November 15th of last year to Wang's residence in Yu Gu Cun, Yu Yuan Road, to draft a will. Wang also enlisted Shi Zhinan, currently an assistant at the Salt Revenue Auditing Office, as the executor of the will. Three days after the will was drafted, Wang passed away at his Shanghai residence. The will was kept by Du Ruizhen, Wang's beloved concubine who attended to him. However, Wang's wife, Ouyang Shunying, residing in Xiamen, and her son, Wang Shengduan, upon receiving the news, immediately published announcements in Shanghai newspapers, stating that all of Wang Yao臣's real estate in Shanghai and Xiamen would be inherited entirely by them. They stated that any objections should be raised within two weeks. Initially, Du Ruizhen took no action. However, in March of this year, she instructed her nephew, Wang Shengqiang, to register with the French Consulate in Xiamen, seeking permission to manage Wang Yao臣's estate. Later, in May, she sold the land on Route Tenant, under the name of Wang Yao臣's deceased father, obtaining over 90,000 yuan. Last month, Ouyang Shunying came to Shanghai from her hometown and hired a lawyer to file a private criminal lawsuit against Du Ruizhen, Lu Xingyuan, and Shi Zhinan for forging a will. Lu and Shi, in turn, filed a countersuit against Ouyang Shunying, accusing her of malicious false accusation and requesting that she be punished for false accusation. Lu Xingyuan also filed a separate criminal lawsuit against Qiu Hanping, Ouyang Shunying's lawyer, on charges of (1) false accusation, (2) instigating false accusation, and (3) defamation. Apart from the case of Lu and Qiu, where the plaintiff Lu Xingyuan had already been summoned once and the hearing rescheduled to the afternoon of November 19th, the case brought by Ouyang Shunying had also been heard twice. The court had ordered a letter to be sent to the Xiamen court for investigation and had adjourned for further review after receiving the reply. All these details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now that the official response from Xiamen has arrived at the court, Judge Xiao Xieffen resumed the hearing yesterday afternoon. However, the first defendant, Du Ruizhen, remained absent. The court decided to temporarily suspend the proceedings regarding the charges against her. Then, the judge inquired of both the plaintiff and the defendants about their opinions regarding the Xiamen court's reply, which stated that the Xiamen court had summoned Wang Yao臣's family in Xiamen, who testified that the writing on the will was indeed Wang Yao臣's handwriting. The plaintiff's lawyer, Qiu Hanping, stated that the testimony was not credible. Lu Xingyuan argued that this was the testimony of the deceased's family, which proved that the will was not forged. Otherwise, the witness was the deceased's brother, how could he harm his sister-in-law's interests? Shi Zhinan also stated that since the will had been verified by the family, he had no objections. Subsequently, lawyer Qiu claimed that Lu Xingyuan was a witness to the will and Shi Zhinan was the executor of the will. However, Lu also represented Shi Zhinan in suing Du Ruizhen, who inherited the estate, to recover Wang Yao臣's debts. This was tantamount to one lawyer representing both the plaintiff and the defendant, which was suspected of soliciting lawsuits and violating the lawyer's regulations. Lu then raised the question of whether Du Ruizhen was Wang Yao臣's wife or concubine, attacking Qiu. Judge Xiao stated that the case was about forgery, not about disputing the status of wife or concubine. Because Qiu insisted that the will was drafted in Lu's office and that the words "Wang Yao臣, also known as Wang Youyu" in the will were in Lu's handwriting, he ordered Lu to write the same words in court for comparison. Lu stated that when he was the president of the two courts here, there were many signatures in the files that could be checked. He then took up a pen as ordered and submitted the written words to the court. Both sides then engaged in debates. First, the plaintiff's lawyer spoke, stating that Wang Shengqiang had never claimed to inherit Wang Yao臣 in the Xiamen court and that the will did not mention it either. Therefore, the testimony of the witnesses from Xiamen was not credible. Moreover, they had not seen the original will, so how could they know that the handwriting was Wang Yao臣's? If there had been a will at the time, why was there no response during the plaintiff's newspaper announcement? If Du Ruizhen was indeed the heir to the estate, why did she sell the Shanghai property under the name of Wang Yao臣's deceased father? All these facts were sufficient to show that the will was forged. Furthermore, Lu's soliciting lawsuits violated the lawyer's regulations. Next, Lu Xingyuan defended himself, stating that the plaintiff's claim that the will was drafted in his office was purely fabricated. The first chapter of the will clearly stated that it was dictated by Wang Yao臣 on his sickbed and that he was merely writing it down. The plaintiff's lawyer was recklessly destroying a fellow lawyer and instigating the plaintiff to falsely accuse him, even dragging the certifying lawyer into the case, which was truly heartbreaking. The plaintiff's lawsuit also stated that the defendants were colluding, but he did not know on what basis. There were other signatories on the will, but they were not sued together, which further showed their malicious slander and public insult, which was intolerable. The defendant's (Lu referring to himself) past and future history, reputation, and lawyer's ethics were all greatly affected. He requested that he be declared innocent and that the plaintiff be punished for false accusation. Then, lawyer Chen Tingrui defended Shi Zhinan, stating that Shi was accused of helping to forge the will, but there was no evidence to prove it. Legal regulations stipulated that fabricating facts to cause others to be subject to criminal penalties by reporting or suing to the authorities should be punished for false accusation. The elements of the plaintiff's crime of false accusation were already complete and should be dealt with according to the law. The court then slightly interrogated the plaintiff Ouyang Shunying and asked the two defendants if they had any final statements. Both Lu and Shi made their own statements, stating that they had a very close friendship with Wang Yao臣 and had done their best to befriend him. Now, his wife did not appreciate their virtue but treated them as enemies, fabricating words to falsely accuse them, which was published in the newspapers, causing damage to their social standing and established reputation. They hoped that the court would make a prompt judgment to distinguish right from wrong. Judge Xiao then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 3rd of this month.</p>

<h3>Extension of Special Pig Transportation Rates for One Year</h3>
<p>Mat-Wrapped Noodles Permitted to be Charged as Special Goods</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus had previously obtained approval from the Ministry of Railways to reduce pig transportation rates by 25% based on the original special rates. This reduction was scheduled to expire on November 30th of this year. However, upon reviewing the pig transportation volume from January to June of this year and comparing it to the same period in the tenth year, there was a significant increase. Therefore, they resubmitted a report and received instruction No. 9786 from the Ministry of Railways, approving an extension of one year from December 1st of this year. Furthermore, the Ministry of Railways, based on a report from the Pinghan Railway Bureau, requested that mat-wrapped vermicelli be added to the list of special light and bulky goods and charged according to the charging methods for special light and bulky goods. After review, this was deemed feasible and approved to be implemented by all railways under the Ministry, starting from December 1st of this year. In addition, the Traffic Department of the two Railway Bureaus has specifically stipulated the following for wild pheasant transportation fees: All pheasants that have been killed and still have feathers can be transported by passenger car and charged at 60% of the ordinary parcel rate, similar to fresh goods. This will be trialed for six months starting from the 11th of this month.</p>

<p>The stamps of the Shanghai Nanshi Cigarette Inspection Office on the packaging paper of "Flying Woman" brand cigarettes produced by Lvxin Cigarette Factory at No. 19, Route Delfes, French Concession, were found to be forged by detectives from the French Concession Cigarette Investigation Office. Yu Lvxin, the owner of Lvxin Cigarette Factory, was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Due to the fact that the identification of this forged stamp by the Police Department was not yet complete, the court was requested twice to extend the deadline for prosecution and trial. These details have been reported in this newspaper. The Police Department further arrested two accomplices, Shen Dazhang (40 years old, from Jiangyin), a runner for Lvxin Cigarette Factory, and Hu A'san (54 years old, from Nanxun), a senior clerk, the afternoon before yesterday. They were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court at noon yesterday. Wang Gangxu, the head of the Criminal Court, conducted the interrogation.

<h3>All Embezzled Funds from Kechi Iron Factory Recovered</h3>
<p>Chen Bangxin Implicates Jin in Instigating the Crime</p>
<p>Kechi Iron Factory, located at No. 120 North Suzhou Road, usually entrusted apprentice Chen Bangxin (also known as Chen Anqing) with depositing large sums of money in various banks. The procedure involved recording the amount in the deposit book, and the banks would stamp the deposit book after receiving the money. However, starting from January 2nd of this year, Chen suddenly had malicious intent and colluded with Fan Baoqing from Changzhou and others to forge the seals of various banks and money houses. When the factory owner instructed him to deposit money, he embezzled the funds and used the forged bank seals on the deposit book to deceive them. By today, the amount he had embezzled had reached 14,604 yuan, which Chen had deposited in various banks in his own name. This was discovered by Chief Inspector Liu Shaokui and Detective Liu Junjie of the General Inspection Office, who arrested Chen and Fan on the 10th of this month at Room 357 of the Da Jiangnan Hotel and the Suzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road. At that time, they seized passbooks and deposit slips totaling 11,176 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen, and the Kechi Factory also found two deposit slips from the Bank of China in Chen's drawer, totaling 1,000 yuan, and a deposit slip from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, totaling 400 yuan.

They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Judge Feng resumed the hearing yesterday morning. The lawyer from the police station, Wang Yaotangzhong, stated that the total amount of recovered stolen money was 14,076 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 fen, with nothing missing. A public prosecution was filed according to Articles 316 and 217 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Chen Bangxin stated that it was entirely Jin, who was on the run, who instigated the crime. Judge Feng Shide ordered a postponement for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>News of the Re-publication of "Exchange Control"</h3>
<p>Translated by Liu Wangsu</p>
<p>Since the Great War in Europe, the world's financial situation has become increasingly unstable.

<h3>City News</h3>
<p>National Coal Relief Committee Solicits Coal Ball Raw Materials. The National Coal Relief Committee believes that Shanghai's coal balls have always been made from imported coal dust, resulting in the loss of rights and benefits. It plans to solicit several types of domestic anthracite coal dust that have a calorific value comparable to imported products and are soft and waxy in nature. Coal mining companies that have this type of coal dust should send a small sample of the goods, along with the chemical composition and price list, to the committee for introduction.</p>
<h3>Film</h3>
<p>Carlton Premieres "Spring Colors of the Ancient City". The Carlton Theater is now showing "Spring Colors of the Ancient City", a great work jointly directed by Hollywood directors Davis and William Lay. The film actually captures the local situation in Paisstine, the ancient Jewish capital. Jews have suffered from the pain of statelessness, so they advocate returning to their long-desolate ancient capital and rebuilding it. There are many majestic songs and music in the film, working and singing at the same time. At a time when we are often chanting the slogan of developing the Northwest, this film is worth introducing.</p>
<p>China Film Gengsu Society Seeks Members. The China Film Gengsu Society was founded by Chang Shaobai, a film and drama artist. After more than a month of preparation, it was established. Its purpose is to serve the film and drama industry, cultivate new talents, and seek the happiness of movie fans and drama fans. It uses a pure and serious spirit to assist in progress. It is now broadly recruiting members in order to proceed step by step. The address is Room 407, Taihe Building, Lloyd Road (behind the Great Shanghai Theater).

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Having read the local news in your newspaper on the 15th regarding Wang Jinbing abandoning his legal wife and taking up with a new lover, this does not align with the facts. Upon investigation, his legal wife, Chen Axiang, along with several others, stormed my bedroom on the 8th of this month, hoping to find something. As I was away on business at the time, Axiang instead entered the room where my fellow villager, Jiang Mao, and the maidservant were sleeping. She falsely accused Jiang Mao (also known as Acui) of being my mistress and mistook her for Shen Suzhen, a waitress from the Wing On Company, which is both ridiculous and infuriating. Jiang Mao has already appointed lawyer Zhou Bingyang to publish a warning in the newspaper and pursue the matter separately. I request that you publish the facts in your newspaper to set the record straight and avoid any misunderstanding. Your cooperation would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>The Path to Political Reform (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan (October 1935, Shanghai)</p>
<p>— Dedicated to the comrades of the Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang and the gentlemen who are interested in discussing political reform —</p>
<p>Based on the two major principles mentioned above, I believe that the path to political reform in the future should include the following two points: (A) The spirit of political tutelage must still be implemented; (B) A draft constitution can be discussed and formulated first; (C) Administrative power must be strengthened; (D) The Party's organization should be further refined.</p>
<p>If we strictly follow the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, then China is not yet ready to promulgate a constitution. Because according to the reconstruction process, once a province is completely stabilized, military rule ceases and political tutelage begins. The so-called political tutelage is to train the people of each county in self-government. Therefore, it is necessary for all counties in a province to achieve complete self-government before the constitutional period begins. Only when more than half of the provinces in the country reach the constitutional start period, can a National Assembly be convened to decide on the constitution and promulgate it. Where in China can we find a province in which all the counties have achieved complete self-government? How much less can we talk about having more than half of the provinces achieve complete self-government? In reality, we are still in the period of political tutelage. However, on the one hand, after five or six years, the results of training the people in self-government have not been significant. Although there are various reasons, such as internal strife, external aggression, natural disasters, and man-made calamities, that have hindered progress, we cannot entirely blame the Kuomintang for not making efforts. However, in any case, the Kuomintang itself feels apologetic to the people, and therefore some people want to end political tutelage as soon as possible to avoid further delay. On the other hand, the Kuomintang, in view of the increasing foreign threats and the growing national crisis, and at the same time feeling that many non-Party so-called "celebrated scholars" are attacking the Kuomintang by taking advantage of the country's difficulties, also wants to implement constitutionalism ahead of time, hoping to open up another path or perhaps "concentrate national strength and save the country from danger." Therefore, the call to draft a constitution and convene a National Assembly has gradually increased. In the winter of 1932, the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee had already resolved to accelerate the "preparations for the start of constitutionalism," so after three years, we should promote its realization in order to maintain our credibility with the people. However, we must know that the constitution is neither omnipotent nor can it be drafted carelessly. Therefore, before the people have the ability to (1) understand the constitution, (2) abide by the constitution, and (3) support the constitution, it would be useless to promulgate a constitution easily, and it might even damage the solemnity of the constitution and weaken its effectiveness. Moreover, the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee still focuses on "expediting the work of local autonomy as stipulated in the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction in the near future" so that the preparations for the start of constitutionalism can continue. So, I ask, has the local autonomy work stipulated by the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction been completed in China today? Is the opportunity to start constitutionalism fully ripe? Anyone who is unwilling to blindly follow the anti-Kuomintang "celebrated scholars" will definitely answer "no!" Therefore, anyone who faithfully believes in the late Premier's teachings and is willing to plan for the country and establish a truly constitutional foundation will definitely unanimously agree that the spirit of political tutelage must still be implemented in the future political system.

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang Binghui reported, briefly stating that the cooperative movement is one of the seven major movements. The central government attaches great importance to this and has issued orders to promote it in various regions, which has already achieved considerable results. Due to environmental factors, it is more difficult to run cooperative societies in Shanghai. Since the Social Bureau has promoted this, all aspects have been advancing, and a Cooperative Venture Committee has been established. Personnel have been dispatched to guide and organize factories. In rural areas, due to the city's financial constraints and lack of funds, it is not easy to develop. Currently, in addition to continuing to promote in the factory sector, it is deemed necessary to actively promote school cooperative societies. Therefore, the Education Bureau was joined in inviting representatives from schools at all levels to discuss: (1) Schools that have already established consumer cooperative societies must register with the Social Bureau in accordance with central government laws; (2) Schools that have not yet organized are expected to assist in the organization; (3) The regulations stipulate that cooperative members must be twenty years old, but most primary and secondary school students do not meet the age requirement, and opinions should be expressed on how to remedy this and discuss it together. Subsequently, Hang Ding'an and Shi Jingsong from the Education Bureau gave brief reports.</p>
<p>Expert Opinions</p>
<p>Next, cooperative expert Hu Duming expressed his opinions: (1) The Social Bureau should guide the cooperative affairs; (2) It would be best to organize a federation of school cooperative societies for business operations. Chen Weifan, a member of the Cooperative Venture Committee, expressed his opinions: (1) Member shares should be collected at the beginning of the semester; (2) At the end of the semester, it should be handled in accordance with the law so as not to lose credit; (3) It is necessary to establish a federation of school cooperatives; (4) School authorities should join in the share capital and send personnel to help; (5) The Social Bureau should train cooperative talents. Finally, Wang Gang reported on the situation of factory cooperative societies in the city, briefly stating that there are over seven thousand factories and over seven hundred thousand workers, but factory cooperative societies cannot develop due to: (1) Insufficient funds; (2) Unsound organization; (3) Inappropriate management; (4) Lack of firm belief.</p>
<p>Measures Decided</p>
<p>Subsequently, the following implementation measures were decided: (1) Invite cooperative experts or those who have considerable research on cooperation to give lectures during commemorative weeks in schools at all levels; (2) The Education Bureau should issue a notice to all schools in the city to add cooperative courses to popularize cooperative knowledge and cultivate cooperative talents; (3) School journals and other publications of schools at all levels should publish as much cooperative material as possible to publicize cooperative text and various cooperative news; (4) Organize performances with cooperative publicity at commemorative meetings or recreational gatherings in schools at all levels; (5) School libraries at all levels should purchase more cooperative books and newspapers to increase students' cooperative knowledge; (6) Schools at all levels that have not established consumer cooperative societies should be prepared and established within a time limit by the Education Bureau's notice; (7) When schools at all levels organize cooperative societies, they should follow the laws and regulations promulgated by the Social Bureau; (8) School authorities at all levels must earnestly promote consumer cooperative societies and allocate one-fourth of the total share capital at the time of opening; (9) Purchases should be limited to daily necessities and all candies and unsanitary items should be prohibited; (10) At the end of the semester, schools at all levels should report their business status to the Social Bureau for record; (11) Consumer cooperative societies at all levels should organize a cooperative society federation to facilitate communication; (12) Schools should collect share capital from students at the beginning of the semester; (13) Request the Education Bureau to assess the situation of cooperative societies in various schools; (14) Schools that have already established consumer cooperative societies but have not applied for registration should register in accordance with the law; (15) Request the Education Bureau to hold cooperative academic lectures; (16) Request the Social Bureau to organize cooperative training classes, with one teacher from each school participating.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Strictly Orders All Schools to Continue Classes as Usual: Students Must Not Be Allowed to Leave School Without Reason; Those Who Violate This Will Be Held Responsible by the Respective School Principals</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday instructed all public and private schools in the city, stating: "In accordance with the Municipal Government's Instruction No. 16298, it has been found that rumors have been rampant in the city recently. Although the government has repeatedly refuted them, ignorant people do not examine the truth and move indiscriminately, causing citizens to feel more frightened and uneasy. It has been heard that schools in the urban area are also spreading false information and absenting themselves from classes and leaving school, which is extremely inappropriate. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to prohibit residents from moving without reason, those who violate this will be considered as disrupting public order. This bureau is ordered to immediately instruct all schools to continue classes as usual and not to allow students to take leave or leave school without reason. Those who violate this will be held responsible by the respective school principals, etc." Accordingly, the school is ordered to comply without fail. This order also applies to national and provincial schools.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"This child has such a wealth of knowledge about these things! He is so focused on them! And now he is so distressed because he doesn't like to read. Therefore, when he is lying in bed sick, he doesn't know how to entertain himself. Fortunately, the children can supply him with countless beetles and stones of various colors. I am so happy to have found this interest of his. This is a good interest, and perhaps it is the beginning of his success. If he one day becomes a great 物家 [material scientist?] or even a musician, then I can celebrate the success of my year's work." At that time, Mrs. March was sitting in front of a book, building many castles in the air, just like she was when she was a girl (note). The only difference is that those were for herself, and now they are for others. Some of these ideals later became reality, probably because of this—because benevolence is the best foundation for all undertakings.</p>
<p>(Note) See Little Women, Chapter 13</p>
<p>Nat found the story of Dan overcoming difficulties and navigating dangers extremely interesting, while Joe especially admired the beetles and butterflies, deeply appreciating the impermanent history of their short lives, as if it were another lovely fairy tale—because although Dan's language was simple, he spoke eloquently, and he was very satisfied to think that at least the little philosopher could learn something from him here. Later, they also described the matter of catching muskrats—whose poor skin was already one of his possessions—tirelessly, when suddenly Mr. Bhaer himself came in and reminded Nat and Joe that it was time for their walk. They then went out, and Dan watched them leave, very envious. So Uncle Bhaer picked him up and put him on the sofa in the living room, so that he could change his environment and air a little.</p>
<h3>Chen Jicheng Gave a Radio Lecture at the Municipal Education Bureau Yesterday on Currency Reform</h3>

<h3>West Youth Basketball Tournament: Few Participants; Only Seven Teams Including Pirates and John Registered for Group A; Registration Has Been Closed But Procedures Can Still Be Completed</h3>
<p>The West Youth YMCA's West Youth Basketball League will begin on the 2nd of next month. Only a dozen Chinese and Western teams have registered for this year's event. There are still vacancies in the prescribed limit of 26 teams, so although registration has been closed, procedures can still be completed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Registration Will Implement New Measures</p>
<p>The organizer of the West Union Basketball League in previous years was Tope, a Westerner who was familiar with the local sports scene. Now that Tope has left Shanghai, the event is organized by his assistant, Bratton. Therefore, it was not possible to contact the teams in advance, so the number of participants is not as enthusiastic as in the past. To remedy this, the five ten-yuan season tickets purchased by each team will be changed to arbitrarily purchased individual tickets. In reality, it is still fifty yuan, but it is much more convenient. The deposit has also been changed to ten yuan. This deposit will be fully refunded if the team does not withdraw at the end of the event.</p>
<p>City Representatives</p>
<p>The teams that have officially joined this year include Jinan University, Maic Lingjia, Pirates, Qingguang, Xiexing, John, and the newly joined Youyou in Group A.

<h3>How to Study Natural Science</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>Since the object of natural science research is nature, then studying natural science, of course, requires going into the natural world to explore. The sun, moon, and stars in the sky, the mountains, rivers, grass, and trees on the ground, and the changes in climate and the life and death of birds and animals are all good materials for our research. As long as you are often close to the natural world, pay attention to observation, and do precise experiments, it is not difficult to explore the mysteries of nature.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to know the morphology of cotton, then you should go to the cotton field to see what its roots are like, what its stems are like, what its leaves are like, what its flowers are like, what its fruits are like, and what its seeds are like. After you know all this, then further observe its growth process, the environment and nutrients it needs for growth, how it absorbs nutrients, and what functions its roots, stems, leaves, and flowers have. It is best if you can try planting it yourself from sowing to harvest. Think about how much accurate and living knowledge you can gain in the process of your own observation and experimentation, which is much more practical and useful than hiding in a walled study, reading dead words, and looking at dead pictures.</p>
<p>Studying nature in this great nature is the real way to study nature. Dear children! I hope you will immediately go into the natural world, find more things you don't recognize, and discover more principles you don't understand.</p>
<h3>Pigeons Deliver Military Orders</h3>
<p>— Wei Bingxin</p>
<p>Zhang Jun, a famous general of the Song Dynasty, was meritorious in protecting the country and resisting foreign enemies. Qu Duan, who was under Zhang Jun's command, was also a general who knew military tactics and had courage. Therefore, Zhang Jun valued him very much and specially made him a General of Military Might.</p>
<p>When Qu Duan's troops were stationed in Xuancheng, Anhui, one day, Zhang Jun suddenly went to inspect them. He entered the barracks and saw that the shallow grass was spread flat on the parade ground, which was tidy and clean. Several military flags fluttered in the air. From afar, he could hear the sound of soldiers blowing military horns. However, he did not see a large number of troops.</p>
<p>Zhang Jun walked along and passed the barracks, and saw five cages with pigeons hanging high under the eaves. "Coo, coo!" the pigeons called in their cages. However, the barracks were quiet, and there were no large troops to be seen. Only a few guards stood at the door.</p>
<p>Zhang Jun was very strange, so he ordered a unit of troops to perform technical exercises. Qu Duan received the order and immediately opened a cage and released a pigeon. Before long, the unit of troops that had been ordered arrived in formation. The military appearance was solemn, and the tactics were skilled. Zhang Jun was very happy to see this.</p>
<p>After the exercise was over, Zhang Jun ordered all the troops to assemble. Qu Duan opened four cages and released four pigeons at the same time. After a while, four teams of troops arrived together. Everyone was full of energy, everyone was physically strong, and the discipline was strict and the movements were agile. This showed that Qu Duan's military management was strict and the soldiers were diligent in training.</p>
<p>Zhang Jun praised the pigeons' speed in delivering military orders and admired Qu Duan's ability to train pigeons to take on the responsibility of delivering military orders. He secretly thought that Qu Duan was indeed a talented general, and his military management was not something that ordinary generals could achieve.</p>
<h3>Two Little Heroes</h3>
<p>— Liu Yongqing</p>
<p>Speaking of these two little heroes, they are none other than the two young martial artists who recently represented the Beijing Minyi National Martial Arts Troupe to participate in the National Games performance in Shanghai. One is Yu Yintang, who is only ten years old this year, and the other is Zhang Zhiping, who is probably only about ten years old. Both of them have learned good martial arts skills and are strong and powerful. They are the two people who are most noticed by a group of friends who like to watch martial arts. They all praised and said: "These two children truly deserve to be called the little heroes in this National Games." Children! Do you envy this title? If you envy it, then hurry up and start learning national martial arts. When you have trained your body with bronze tendons and iron bones, then everyone will call you a little hero too. As the saying goes, "To strengthen the country, we must first strengthen the body." The current national situation is like this. When will we strengthen our bodies if we don't do it now? Children! Work hard!</p>
<h3>Autumn Leaves</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>In autumn, many children search for various leaves to hold exhibitions. "Autumn Leaf Exhibition" is a very interesting event. Many school classrooms also use various autumn collections to create very flavorful and beautiful patterns. Red, yellow, green... We will take this opportunity to talk to the children about autumn trees.</p>
<p>The children are puzzled at first, why do the leaves fall in autumn? To tell you the truth, this is the plant's way of survival. Plant growth requires moisture, and without moisture, it will wither. In winter, there is less moisture, and leaves are the organs that evaporate moisture. To retain moisture and prevent it from evaporating, it has to sacrifice its leaves. Therefore, in many plants, a special cell layer, the abscission layer, grows at the base of the leaf stalk in autumn. This layer dissolves the middle layer of the cell wall, causing the leaves to fall off, and seals the ducts of the vascular bundles, isolating the inside from the outside, so that moisture does not easily evaporate, preparing for winter.</p>
<p>The children are also curious, why do many leaves turn red and yellow in late autumn and early winter? Here we must first understand what the green color of the leaves is. I have already told everyone in the science lecture. The leaf tissue contains chloroplasts, and these chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll. This chlorophyll contains two colored substances, a green pigment and a yellow pigment. In autumn, the weather gradually cools and becomes drier. After the old chloroplasts are destroyed, new chloroplasts cannot grow. The yellow pigment, however, is not destroyed, so the color of the leaves gradually turns yellow. As for the reason for the red color, it is because the leaves accumulate sugar, which is converted into a reddish anthocyanin, so the leaves appear bright red, like maple leaves.</p>
<h3>Save One Hundred Wen Every Day</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Children, are there many vendors gathering near your school every day? Are the things these vendors sell mostly dirty, low-priced, and inferior sweets and unripe or rotten fruits? In addition, aren't there often "White Elephant Grand World," "The Legend of the Cat and the Crown Prince," "Heaven, Earth, and Man," and "One Copper for a Lucky Draw" games like golf balls and flashing light bulbs?</p>
<p>Dirty, low-priced, and inferior candies and fruits are harmful to hygiene. One copper for a lucky draw fosters gambling habits in children. I think your teachers have already told you all this in detail, so I don't want to say much about it here. What I want to say here is that it's a pity those coppers in your pockets are being swindled away by those vendors.</p>
<p>Based on my own experience as a primary school student, it's very common for a primary school student to spend ten coppers a day. Of course, there are also primary school students who spend twenty cents a day. Now, using ten coppers a day as a standard, that's three thousand wen per month. Every year, you spend at least ten yuan. If you study in elementary school for six years, and spend ten yuan each year, then you will spend sixty yuan in six years. If you save the ten coppers you intended to use to buy candy and play the lucky draw every day, you might accumulate close to one hundred yuan in six years, including interest.</p>
<p>Isn't one hundred yuan already a considerable sum?</p>
<p>The above is based on the example of one primary school student. If your school has three hundred students, and each student spends ten yuan per year, then three hundred people will spend three thousand yuan. In six years, that's three sixes, eighteen thousand yuan. If you saved that money, the amount after six years, including interest, would be enough to startle you.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be good to donate this large sum of money to the school to improve its facilities? Donating it to the government to carry out construction projects would also be a small contribution.</p>
<p>Children, it may seem insignificant to be cheated out of one hundred wen by vendors every day. But if you save one hundred wen every day, will the result still be insignificant?</p>
<h3>Wood Chopping Song</h3>
<p>— Lu Eryu</p>
<p>One chop, two chops,</p>
<p>Chop a pile of firewood to burn,</p>
<p>The cracks on my hands are grades,</p>
<p>Bending and hunching, I'm busy with the big exam,</p>
<p>I don't have a teacher in the classroom,</p>
<p>Nor do I have a neat long gown and jacket.</p>
<p>My diploma is firewood,</p>
<p>My textbook is a knife,</p>
<p>I learn about myself from life,</p>
<p>I train my mind from bloody sweat;</p>
<p>Don't you see nature mocking me,</p>
<p>Laughing at me for practicing arithmetic by drawing on the ground with wheat stalks.</p>

<h3>A Letter to Little Friend A-Guo</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zengliang, Fourth Grader, Jiading Lou Tang Central Elementary School</p>
<p>Little Friend A-Guo:</p>
<p>I heard the teacher say: "The dispute between Italy and your country is due to the fact that the Italian army once failed in your Adwa area, so they want to take revenge this time. The immediate cause is the Walwal incident. Italy says: 'You attacked first,' and you say: 'Italy attacked first.' But I don't know which country moved first. Whoever moves first is wrong."</p>
<p>Now your two countries are at war, that is, formally at war. Italy sent a large number of planes to bomb your Taixi, Adwa, and other places very severely. Your children were unfortunately bombed to death by the hateful Italian army, more than thirty of them. These children really died very painfully! I dare to represent the children of the Republic of China to offer you condolences and sympathy, and wish you continuous progress!</p>
<p>Your Chinese friend, Zhang Zengliang</p>

<h3>The Story of the White Mountain Parrot (10)</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>I said gladly: "Sir, that may be right. It is indeed a great honor for me. If I were not a white parrot, then you would not be so polite to me. Please feel free to ridicule and teach me. On the one hand, I would also like to ask you to tell me your great name."</p>
<p>He replied: "I am the great poet Jacques Tuken. Sir, I have traveled to many places. I have been through desolate areas and suffered all kinds of hardships. I sang songs in the time of Louis XVI, and I can sing songs in the time of the Republic and the Empire. Whether it is joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness, I can sing songs from the depths of my heart. I am getting old, but we are working hard to sing. As you can see, I am dreaming up a new poem here, at least six pages long, but I didn't expect to bump my forehead suddenly. However, if I can help you, I would be very willing to help you."</p>
<p>I replied: "Sir, you can indeed help me, because I am now encountering a difficulty in poetry. I dare not say that I am a poet myself, let alone a great poet like you." I bowed to him and continued: "But nature has given me a string of vocal cords. Whether in times of peace or trouble, my throat is always itchy. To be honest with you, I completely do not understand the rhythm of poetry."</p>
<p>Jacques Tuken replied: "I have forgotten it, and you don't have to take this rhythm to heart."</p>
<p>I said: "But I have encountered a troublesome thing. People often find my voice very harsh." Jacques Tuken hurriedly said: "I am the same way. I don't know why. When I was young, people would scold me when I sang, but now I don't care."</p>
<p>I said: "But I always feel unbearable. Please listen to my singing now and give me some practical guidance, will you?"</p>
<p>Jacques Tuken replied: "That's great, I'm here listening attentively."</p>
<h3>Crab's Life</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>The crabs are fat, and the chrysanthemums are yellow. It is a great time to hold crabs and enjoy chrysanthemums! Children! Have you ever thought about what a crab's life is like? Let's take this opportunity, when the crabs are on the market, to talk to you little friends.</p>
<p>(1) Shape: The crabs on the seashore are slightly different in shape from those we usually see on the market. That is, the two pincers (commonly known as claws), one is particularly large, and the other is very small. There are also eight legs, and the back is covered with a hard and smooth shell. Because its two pincers are like our hands, the small one can hold things and find food, and when digging holes, both pincers are used. This is the shape of the male crab. The female's two pincers are different, small and weak, do not dig holes, nor fight. If something is happening outside, it must return to the river to hide. The eyes are very strange. Two poles grow on the head, and the two eyes grow on the top of the poles, which can be stretched freely. When entering the hole, first shrink the two eyes in, and then curl up the eight legs before entering the hole. The body shell color has red, green, yellow, blue, and other colors. The pincer color is especially bright on the shell, and there are many patterns on the shell, some with small dots, some with roads, which are very beautiful. When cooked, the whole body is red.</p>
<p>(2) Nesting: On the beach, there are individual holes, which are its home. If you go in to see, there are small gatehouses, as well as bedrooms, kitchens, and food storage. When nesting, it takes advantage of the low tide. First, it digs sand with a large pincer, then clamps it in the pincer wing and carries it outside to discard it. There is also a method of only using three legs to scoop up soil, and the remaining eight legs crawl.</p>
<p>(3) Molting: It has a hard shell. How does the body grow up? Its shell change is similar to our changing clothes. It must enter the hole, first take off the back shell, and then shed the pincers and eight legs, like a person taking off a hat, shoes, and socks. After the molting is completed, the body is extremely tired and will not come out for several days, fearing that enemies will make things difficult for it. When the female crab molts, the male crab also does not go out, but protects it in the nest. The food eaten during molting has been pre-stored in the cave. Small crabs need to change their shells frequently, and they grow very quickly.</p>
<p>(4) Fighting: The nature of these crabs is the most fierce. If another crab is at its own door, it will immediately fight. First, it protrudes its eight legs, then gradually stands up, retracts its two eye poles, and stretches out a large pincer, ready to go forward to fight. Their fighting method is to clamp with the pincers, which are sharp like scissors. If a leg is broken, it doesn't matter, it can still fight. If a large pincer, or an eye, or the back shell is injured, it must run away.</p>

<h3>Securities and Bonds: Maintaining Momentum Remains Difficult</h3>
<p>The bullish side still has some strength, while most of the short sellers are silently observing to see how things change. Retail investors, not easily frightened, have mostly turned bullish along with the trend. Therefore, the market situation changed from chaos to rising. Then, the northern rumors resurfaced, and the short sellers regained their advantage, exerting some pressure, and the market price turned from rising to falling again. People's confidence, initially strengthened by the authorities' denial of the rumors, was weakened by the northern rumors. The turbulent environment is enough to disrupt people's minds. To forcefully boost the market, one must consider the strength of the bullish side and the changes in the environment. However, there are not many days left in this month's futures, and the fierce competition ahead can be anticipated. Yesterday's process: the opening saw buyers for numbers 16, 24, 35, 38, and 69, mostly engaging in small transactions. Sellers included numbers 33, 47, 48, 54, and 78. The market price was pushed up by several cents to 1.23 yuan, with the military reduction soaring by 1.78 yuan. The rebound was too strong, and the momentum weakened. In the second session, the earlier positions slightly retreated by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan, while the later positions, due to large purchases by number 35 and absorption by numbers 4, 11, and 16, were again pushed up by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan to around 1 yuan. In the afternoon session, rumors resurfaced, and the military reduction felt powerless, starting from a strong position until the end. Numbers 48, 67, and 78 continued to sell, becoming increasingly active. Number 33 took advantage of the low prices to cover short positions, and buyers gradually withdrew, causing high prices to uniformly decline, down 0.01 to 0.02 yuan to around 0.06 to 0.07 yuan. Observing the trend throughout the day, numbers 47, 48, 54, and 78 were selling in each session, and the future remains uncertain. The market price ultimately rebounded, reaching around 1 yuan with a few cents to spare. The total transaction volume was approximately 30 million yuan. The results of the gains and losses are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Continues to Advance</p>
<p>A report from New Feng Foreign Firm stated that yesterday (the 15th), the New York stock market continued to advance. Early morning saw some profit-taking, but due to the results of the British election and good business news, it rebounded. As a result, the industrial stock index reached a new four-year high, and the railway stock index reached its highest point since 1935. Trading was very active, with only the public utility sector being slightly quiet. Automotive, agricultural machinery, petroleum, and special stocks all rose. Small exchange stocks rose slightly, and the bond market advanced strongly. The total daily trading volume was 2.94 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>14th     15th     Change</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks     145.59   146.32   Up 0.73</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks       36.93    47.24    Up 0.41</p>

<p>Eleven Commodities           57.09    57.58    Up 0.29</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower Market Situation Eases; Yarn Market Driven by Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>Each Month Jumps Up by More Than Two Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and stabilized in the afternoon, with the situation improving. This was because reports indicated that Japanese guards were being withdrawn, calming people's minds. Local authorities in this city earnestly denied the rumors, and the market atmosphere eased. In addition, the overseas cotton industry situation was steadily rising, and raw cotton prices were high, leading to increased cotton yarn costs. Market prices were therefore difficult to fall. Buyers in this month were said to be preparing to take delivery, with the sole increase being 2.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Jinji and Changfeng Purchase</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market saw uniformly higher openings for each month, with the rising momentum particularly strong. This was because news of the situation had turned peaceful, and U.S. cotton prices were rising. The high cost of raw materials led to a surge in the closely related yarn market. Changfeng and Gengfeng also joined in purchasing, so the previously precarious market situation suddenly showed vitality. By the third session, the market sentiment was even stronger. As a result, each month's closing price was 1.8 to 2.7 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was suddenly tense, with each month jumping up by 1 yuan. However, by the second and third sessions, the bulls were selling, causing the market to slightly loosen and suddenly decline. As a result, this month's price was 1 yuan higher than the morning closing price, with distant months falling by 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 yuan. Sales records showed that Tongji sold 1,050 bales, Dafu 650 bales, Yuda 600 bales, Jinchang 700 bales, Senkang 950 bales, Changyu 800 bales, Yichang 750 bales, Daji 1,200 bales, and Tongfeng 500 bales. Purchases were made by Hengyi 800 bales, Dafeng 750 bales, Gengfeng 1,800 bales, Changfeng 1,900 bales, Yongda 550 bales, Runkang 450 bales, Changji 650 bales, and Hexing 450 bales.

<p>Counterparts: 200 Changsha: 30    Anqing: 50</p>
<p>Hankou: 10</p>
<h3>Continuous Export News; Cotton Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very strong, with the rising momentum even stronger. This is because the U.S. and Indian cotton markets have been rising for days, and the calculated price of foreign cotton has increased. Therefore, foreign firms are all buying, and the market atmosphere is becoming increasingly strong. As for the Japanese firms' transportation for export, it is constantly happening, so the cotton market is even stronger, it is said.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Jumps Wildly by 0.6 to 0.7 Yuan</p>
<p>The opening of the flower market was due to the continued rise of U.S. cotton by 15 points per pound, already exceeding the production cost by 0.12 yuan. Indian cotton also rose by 3 rupees, and it was predicted that the upward trend would continue. Therefore, American and An firms frequently purchased, and each month opened at a high level, jumping up by 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 yuan. The second and third sessions were flat, and the closing saw increased positions taken by Xincheng, and the market rebounded again. As a result, each month's closing price was 0.55 to 0.8 or 0.9 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw the near months quite strong, jumping up due to news that Japanese firms were again bundling for export. However, the distant months became tired as those who had made profits sold. The second and third sessions remained calm, and the closing saw a slight decline. As a result, the near months were 0.1 yuan higher than the morning closing price, while the distant months fell by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan. Sales records showed that Dafu sold 1,600 dan, Tongji 2,000 dan, Xincheng 1,500 dan, Daji 3,900 dan, Taichang 1,700 dan, Yichang 1,700 dan, Runkang 2,300 dan, Yuda 3,800 dan, Mingde 1,800 dan, Shenchang 1,400 dan, and Weihe 4,500 dan. Purchases were made by Jifeng 1,700 dan, Dafeng 2,000 dan, Yuan Yi 1,900 dan, Changfeng 3,200 dan, Tonghe 3,400 dan, Xincheng 1,300 dan, Changhe 3,600 dan, Gengfeng 1,400 dan, Runkang 2,900 dan, Yongda 2,400 dan, and Yuanxingchang 3,200 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for each day are listed below:</p>
<p>Japanese Firms Make Large Cotton Purchases</p>
<p>Regarding spot cotton consumption, purchases by Japanese firms alone are strong. Local factories lack appetite. Sources estimate that 596 bales of Yao flower and 2,640 bales of Tongzhou flower are available, it is said.</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Initially Weak, Then Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's U.S. cotton opening showed a downward trend, with prices falling by 1 to 3 points per pound in each month due to long positions taking profits and selling from the South and local areas. However, the selling volume was absorbed by peers and foreign firms. There was no new development after that, and the weather conditions were not as unfavorable as predicted. Buyers became hesitant after the sudden rise the previous day. Before the closing, short positions were covered, and brokers made new purchases, causing prices to rise again. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points per pound, and futures prices rose by 6 to 13 points per pound. Spot prices at the base were extremely strong. Demand for textiles was good. Hester estimated that factory consumption this week was 392,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory was 211,000 bales. British cotton spot prices rose by 12 points, and futures prices rose by 2 points. Indian cotton saw a few short positions covered, and European exporters occasionally entered and exited. Pingguoer rose by 3.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 3.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 3.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 15th).</p>
<p>Also, according to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi flower on the 16th was 230 rupees, an increase of 1.25 rupees compared to the previous day's closing.</p>

<h3>Grain Prices Rise, Then Retreat; Flour Market Lacks Momentum</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a momentary surge in prices for each month in the morning due to foreign wheat quotations rising by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan in Chicago and by 0.135 yuan in Canada. Therefore, the market sentiment was quite firm, with near and distant futures being about 0.02 yuan better than the previous day. However, due to the turbulent situation, people's minds had not yet settled, and some of the long positions retreated. Moreover, after the market had risen sharply, actual sales slowed down, inevitably leading to stagnation and a quiet mood. This was not unrelated. By the afternoon opening, trading was sluggish, with only over 200,000 bags traded in half a day, and prices remained steady with little fluctuation, only about 0.01 yuan better than the previous day's closing price. Currently, with credit still not significantly loosened, many in the industry are adopting a wait-and-see approach. The market's so-called surge is mostly due to speculation, it is said.</p>

<h3>客秈 Rice Hoarders Search and Buy</h3>
<p>——盤價突昇三角——</p>
<p>The arrival of Ke Xian rice was very strong yesterday. The market was originally soft and remained weak at the opening in the morning. Then, due to sudden inquiries from hoarders, and greed from the local street, large external players rushed to hoard and buy. 11,000 bags of Jiangxi rice were immediately offered, mostly taken by hoarders. Afterwards, hoarders and the local street competed with each other, and the market price immediately soared by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. In addition to Gan rice, 2,500 bags of Xiang rice, 4,000 bags of Wentai Ningbo rice, and 450 bags of Zhangzhou rice were also newly offered. The total offering reached about 18,000 bags. If hoarders become active again today and tomorrow, the market price may have to be raised step by step. There is a shortage of foreign rice, with 400 bags of small-grain rice offered, and the price also followed, with a little over 0.3 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>期麥 Market 平平午好</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw prices open flat in the morning. Due to foreign wheat quotations rising by 0.2 to 0.35 yuan, the market sentiment was relatively stable. However, due to the unsound environment, most insiders and outsiders adopted a wait-and-see approach, resulting in extremely sluggish trading. In the afternoon, each session saw a slight improvement in trading, with market prices rising by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Without special circumstances, prices should not see a further surge. This is because, judging from the spot foreign wheat market, no matter what, flour mills will eventually have to import foreign wheat. Therefore, excessively high prices may lead to a reaction. The current wheat market situation remains stable, with Shandong wheat offered at 4.92 to 4.93 yuan, Xiping wheat at 4.92 yuan, Jiangbei Liao wheat at 4.87 to 4.88 yuan, Shaheji wheat at 3.9 yuan, and Hankou wheat at 4.62 yuan, totaling 3,000 bags, purchased by Xinda, it is said.</p>

<p>100 bushels of Canadian wheat have been designated for export overseas, and local manufacturers also continue to have demand. Therefore, if demand does not decrease, prices should continue to rise, but this is highly doubtful, it is said.</p>

<h3>天雨 Rice Prices Turn Upward</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 30 origins arrived (a total of over 6,000 piculs). Although sales in the local street market were not yet strong, they seemed to be more active. Moreover, thanks to the rainy weather, people's minds turned upward, and the situation gradually shifted. The price of thick early and other new japonica rice increased by 0.2 yuan, and thin indica rice also increased by 0.1 yuan. However, the sales of Baozi rice declined due to the Tianjin Qing gang's appetite weakening, with only over 1,000 bags handled. In addition, the eating plate was harsh, resulting in a slight decrease. Du Yangjian rice was digested quite well, following the price increase by 0.1 yuan. Yinbian Yuan rice was observed by wine merchants, and although arrivals were scarce, the market sentiment remained flat. Broken rice lacked a market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) 36-37 origins arrived. Each type of rice on the market sold well. Although the rainy weather continued, many stores listed goods, leading to continued digestion. The market situation saw white japonica thin indica rice prices increase by 0.2 yuan, and Yang Du Bu Jian and early indica rice prices increase by about 0.1 yuan. White Yuan rice remained stagnant in small quantities, with prices weakening by nearly 0.1 yuan. The other types of rice also showed a tight trend.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Spot Prices Fall Daily</h3>
<p>Recently, the various silk markets abroad have seen price fluctuations return to normal. However, silk prices in Shanghai have indeed continued to decline slightly, and transactions have been very scarce. Yesterday, Dachang Transport Nayang Firm had some purchases, such as white factory warp Shuangbao brand Group Section sold for 950 yuan, which was about 50 yuan lower than before, it is said.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Industry Consensus on New Pricing for Wax and Grass</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Kashiwax Industry Association held a price evaluation meeting yesterday (the 15th) at 2 PM. The attending representatives included He Yinsheng, Shi Runsheng, Wang Zhihong, Wu Junzhi, Ye Guangjiu, and over ten others. He Yinsheng was elected chairman, and Mr. Wang reported that, according to messages from the producing areas, the selling price of Kashiwax was insufficient to cover costs. It was asked whether the price should be slightly increased to protect capital. After deliberation, it was decided that Chongjing (per shi) would be 21.6 yuan, Macheng (per market catty, per dan) would be 19.2 yuan, Mixin (per market catty, per dan) would be 116 yuan, unified, plus two yuan. The industry was notified to comply with the decision and not to cause chaos, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Thick Tinplate in Short Supply</h3>
<p>——Black Iron Sheet Sales Revive——</p>
<p>Recently, thick tinplate has seen high prices, up to 62 to 63 yuan per box, an increase of 7 to 8 yuan compared to before, due to purchases by military factories, toy factories, and machine factories, with a continuous stream of arrivals.</p>
<p>After the closure of the Qingdao Hot Water Bottle Factory, 18-gauge black iron sheets saw a revival in trading with customers from Qingdao Yanhao and other groups yesterday, with transactions reaching 500 to 600 dan, selling for 9 yuan and filling corners per dan.</p>

<h3>Religious Studies on Daoism</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Daoism is China's only indigenous religion. It has been popular in China for far longer than Buddhism, and its prevalence among the general populace is on par with Buddhism. Therefore, when examining the evolution of religion in China, it should not be ignored.</p>
<p>According to old legends, the general public says that Daoism originated with Lao Tzu. However, Chinese historians, based on historical facts, say that it was created by Zhang Daoling at the end of the Han Dynasty. In reality, I believe that both of these statements are incorrect. Although Lao Tzu's teachings contain the idea that all things are made up of a natural "qi" – something invisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear, and untouchable by hand – and he used this to advocate a natural philosophy where everything in the universe is interconnected and mutually transforming through the "qi," he actually opposed nature. His ideas were a reflection and preservation of the economic life of primitive society, a philosophy of reverting to the past. He never promoted religious ideas of alchemy and transcendence. He was an ancient Chinese philosopher, not a religious figure. As for Zhang Daoling, although he was indeed the first to publicly promote Daoism, and because of the extreme corruption of society at the end of the Han Dynasty, and the general populace of farmers had nowhere to turn, he was able to gather many followers to support him. However, this was merely a coincidence that catered to the people's dissatisfaction with the status quo and their desire for liberation. Therefore, Daoism was greatly welcomed by the general public at that time and formed an unprecedented force, but it cannot be said that Daoism was created by Zhang Daoling. The fact is very clear that even before that time, the aristocratic class already had this kind of religious superstition. Emperor Qin Shi Huang sent people into the sea to seek immortals and the elixir of immortality, and Emperor Wu of Han also built platforms to seek immortals and the immortal dew that could grant eternal life. This is clear evidence.</p>
<p>The origins of Daoism are very ancient. Judging from its doctrines and methods of liberation, it is based on the Chinese theory of the Five Elements, which has been popular in China for a long time. Furthermore, I believe that this theory of the Five Elements, on the one hand, is a refinement and purification of primitive animistic nature worship, and on the other hand, it is a kind of primitive natural philosophy. This is because animistic nature worship recognizes that all things have spirits, the vital essence of real objects, which becomes the fundamental element of the existence and activity of objects. The theory of the Five Elements worships this kind of spiritual vital energy; it is merely a further step than primitive animism, examining them in terms of their relationships and mutual transformations, speaking of them in more supernatural and powerful terms, and worshiping them in a more intense and beneficial way. Therefore, the Five Elements theory argues that the five kinds of vital energy generate and overcome each other, mutually transforming to create all things, and when their combination is harmonious and balanced, it can also enable the universe and all things to exist forever. That is to say, the spiritual vital energy of all things, such as the metal, wood, water, fire, and earth vital energies specifically identified by the Five Elements theory, is the basis for the existence and change of real things, which is consistent with the ideas of animistic nature worship. However, the five elements of the Five Elements theory are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, and these things are all matter, so they can also be regarded as elements. The evolution of all things from the generation and overcoming changes of these five elements also means that all things are evolved from these few basic elements. Therefore, if viewed from another perspective, the Five Elements theory is just like ancient Greek natural philosophy, recognizing that all things in the universe are evolved from several elements. It is the same as Parmenides' advocacy of water and earth; Empedocles' advocacy of fire, air, water, and earth; Anaximenes' advocacy of air; and Heraclitus' advocacy of water as the origin of all things. Even these natural philosophies were ancient materialistic philosophies, so the Chinese Five Elements theory also contains that kind of primitive materialistic philosophical thought.</p>
<p>However, what about Daoism? It is formed by mixing the Five Elements theory – that is, such a natural philosophical worldview – with the religious superstitions of primitive animism, and simplifying the primitive animistic nature worship. According to Daoist doctrine, it recognizes that the universe and all things, as well as humans, are composed of the same five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The human body is a microcosm that is connected to the macrocosm. These natural elements are changing; they can change and combine to form all things, and they can also change and combine to form humans, so humans live by inheriting these vital energies of heaven and earth. Not only that, but the material elements of the five elements do nothing but circulate and change in the universe, but they will not disappear. Therefore, if one can obtain these elements and make them coordinate and balance, then this formed object can exist forever. Therefore, it also contains here the view that the basic elements of matter are eternally imperishable, and that everything in the universe can change endlessly, interconnect and intergrow, and never disappear. Daoism forms its doctrines based on such a natural philosophical worldview, so its method of liberation is different from any other religion. It advocates working on material entities to achieve the imperishability of the spirit – that is, to achieve immortality – or to transcend the existing form of the body in order to achieve the goal of becoming an immortal and ascending to heaven. This is the origin of its alchemy and ascension doctrines.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>According to Daoist cultivation methods, the main idea is that the key to longevity and immortality lies in gathering the vital energy inherited from heaven and causing it to condense and not disperse. This goal can be achieved through alchemy and hygiene techniques. So-called alchemy has internal and external alchemy. Internal alchemy involves introspective breathing and guidance exercises to seek the agile and harmonious circulation of the vital energy of the five elements that make up the body, so that they are permanently bound together and do not disperse. In this way, even if separated from the physical body, the complete vital energy or spirit of a person can still not disappear – that is, a person can ascend to heaven and be immortal. External alchemy involves collecting material elements, such as mercury, lead, and poria cocos, and refining them into golden pills to swallow, in order to replenish vital energy. The cultivation methods of internal alchemy, such as meditation, breathing exercises, and sexual techniques, are all merely methods of hygiene. But regardless of internal or external alchemy, they all use the application and replenishment of material vital energy as a method, and do not seek methods of liberation outside of material qualities. Its transcendence is also the same: physical ascension or bodily transformation. Daoism believes that this is becoming an immortal; it is not simply the liberation of some soul, but rather that the material vital energy must be cultivated to the point where it can permanently condense and not disperse, and can freely perform its tangible and intangible changes, freely traveling between heaven and earth and even within the earth. Only then is it considered becoming an immortal and achieving liberation.</p>
<p>From this perspective, although Daoism is also a religion, a groundless fantasy and illusion, it is a religious doctrine that disguises primitive materialistic philosophy and its worldview with a religious cloak. This is because other religions, such as Buddhism, completely rely on asceticism and inner cultivation as methods of cultivation, rejecting material desires and even paying attention to the virtuous consequences of behavior as conditions, and their liberation and salvation is the freedom and comfort of the soul, or even a liberation method that is completely unrelated to the physical body in the afterlife and in reality, a liberation method that is ethical and idealistic.</p>
<p>Because the liberation of Daoism is different from the liberation method of Buddhism, it is based on the differences of the philosophical ideas of the two worldviews, so they often oppose and struggle against each other in China. Naturally, with Daoism's somewhat vulgar materialistic thought, it is bound to be no match for the more profound religious philosophy of idealistic Buddhism in its struggle. Therefore, later Daoists, such as Wang Chongyang of the Quanzhen School, could not help but gradually be influenced by Buddhism and even Confucianism, and adopted ethical ideas of cultivating virtue, advocating transcendence of the realm of desire and form, and advocating leaving the world, etc., from the purely materialistic cultivation of the body and methods of liberation. However, if we talk about the dissemination of Daoism – that is, the popularization of its religious ideas – it is no less than Buddhism, which is fully expressed in Chinese myths and novels. Because in many myths and novels, not only are there stories about many people cultivating and ascending to become gods, but there are also stories about many kinds of creatures that can cultivate and become immortals, such as the so-called Great Immortal White Crane, Great Immortal Lotus, Fox Fairy, Great Immortal Turtle, etc., all kinds of strange things, all of which are performed based on Daoist doctrines. Even the Journey to the West, which promotes Buddhism, such as Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Monk, can cultivate from monkeys, pigs, and sharks to become gods, and their abilities are very great. Sun Wukong was able to steal peaches of immortality to gain longevity and increase his Daoist powers. These are not Buddhist ideas but Daoist ideas, which is very clear. In short, although Daoism is vulgar, it cannot be said that its doctrines are completely devoid of a profound philosophical worldview. We naturally oppose those groundless fantasies and illusions, but taking from them fragments of knowledge and philosophical ideas of Chinese culture entrusted to religion is also one of the good materials.</p>
<p>Biographies</p>
<h3>The Black Napoleon</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>There is an island in the West Indies called Santo Domingo (Haiti), which is now a nominally independent republic. However, this island was formerly a territory of France, and the majority of its inhabitants are Black. These Black people, in order to break away from French rule and establish their own country, naturally went through arduous struggles. The person we are going to talk about here, who is called the Black Napoleon, Toussaint Louverture, is a figure who emerged from the Santo Domingo independence movement.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1791, the Black people of Santo Domingo began to revolt against the control and oppression of the white people. The development of this resistance movement increasingly plunged Santo Domingo into a state of chaos. At this time, Toussaint, who was known as the Black Napoleon, although he was a slave, was quite respected and trusted by the Black people in general. He was able to command many Black people, so he still had some power. However, at this time, he was very calm. He paid no attention to the peasant unrest and the sounds of killing outside the door, but simply observed quietly. The supervisor of his plantation, Bayou, was not in the plantation at this time. His wife was left to guard the plantation. This lady felt the danger at the time and advocated moving away immediately, but Toussaint persuaded her to be quiet and not to be afraid, and that he would be responsible for everything. Later, the supervisor Bayou came and saw that his plantation was completely different from the other plantations, and the order was still as orderly as usual. He was very happy and patted Toussaint on the shoulder, praising his talent. It turned out that Toussaint had his own defense force under his command. The reason why the plantation was able to be safe was entirely due to the maintenance of his defense force.</p>
<p>Toussaint's defense force was different from the general defense forces of the Black people on Santo Domingo Island at that time. It was very mighty and had considerable combat power. At that time, the Black people on the island especially praised him, saying that as long as his defense force came out, the strong enemy would definitely disperse without a fight. A few months after his defense force was established, he became an important figure in the island's defense force and participated in the island's governing secrets. The rules of his defense force were very strict. Those who could not abide by the rules had to withdraw from the force, but if they were members, they had to strictly abide by the rules, otherwise they would be severely punished. His slogan was "Freedom and Independence Self-Defense." His inner interpretation of this, of course, was to strive for the freedom and independence of the Black people, not to protect the rights of the white people.</p>
<p>When Santo Domingo was still in turmoil, three new envoys were sent from France who did not recognize his army as the official army of Santo Domingo. In this way, his defense force had to be disbanded and his weapons had to be taken away. Therefore, he decided to resolutely resist. He delivered a very long speech. In the middle of this, he analyzed the contradictions among the European countries that ruled the West Indies and even the entire Americas, and how to use this contradiction to fight for their own independence and freedom. He said: "Our goal is only one—Santo Domingo belongs to the Black people!" However, the atmosphere of stability in the meeting place at that time was very strong, so he could not take immediate action. As a result, two representatives were elected to negotiate with the French representatives. In this negotiation, because the opinions of the two sides were sharply opposed, there was the possibility of immediate change. But on April 4, 1792, such news suddenly came that mulattoes and non-slave Black people could have all the rights equal to those of white people, which of course eased the situation. Then the revolutionary government of France replaced the three envoys who had been sent before, and the new ones were Jacobins who were close to Robespierre. As a result, the mulattoes surrendered to the white people's military. The Black people were not looked down upon either. At this time, Toussaint felt that the opportunity was coming soon and paid special attention to the changes in the overall situation. Sure enough, due to the long-term disturbances, there were very many farmers who could not return, so a new disturbance occurred again. And the white people also imposed all kinds of abuse on the Black people. The Black people who were arrested by them were all killed, imprisoned, or tortured. Of course, the Black people were still constantly resisting. Under these circumstances, Toussaint had the idea of joining the resistance. At the same time, the leader of the rebellion, Boukman, also issued him such an ultimatum:</p>
<p>"Toussaint! You are required to cooperate with my army within one week! If you and your army do not come to combine with us within one week, we will recognize you as an enemy, and the first person we want to execute by fire is you!"</p>
<p>After some consideration, Toussaint resolutely decided to leave the plantation and lead 200 strong soldiers to participate in the resistance movement. Due to his participation, the Black people's military resistance force was of course increased. As a result, the French army was defeated, and the French General Galbaud led thousands of people to escape to North America. At the same time, in this chaos, Santo Domingo, the so-called Western Paradise Island, also became a cave of terror.</p>
<p>Under such tense circumstances, the white people in North and South America felt greatly uneasy. They specially convened a meeting for this matter and unanimously decided to organize a united white front to jointly suppress the Black people and shouted the slogan of overthrowing the Black people. But at this time, due to the outbreak and development of the French Revolution in Europe, it aroused the joint intervention of Britain, Germany, and Spain. This gave the colonies a great influence, and the white people's alliance quickly disintegrated. What followed was the emergence of an alliance against the French Revolution. The leader of this anti-French alliance in Santo Domingo was Spain. Toussaint saw this clearly and decided to unite with Spain to resist France. At that time, the leaders of the Black people in Santo Domingo also united with Spain, but they were grateful for the help of the Spanish royal family and were used by them. Toussaint was not like that. He knew that Spain was not really helping the Black people resist France, but was using them to fight for rights. Therefore, his alliance with Spain was not to be used by it, but to use Spain to fight for its own independence and freedom.</p>
<p>For the freedom and independence of Santo Domingo, Toussaint led the Black people to wage a heroic and glorious war against the French soldiers. As a result, he greatly defeated the French army with a surprise attack and occupied many important places on Santo Domingo Island, forcing the French to recognize the equal rights of the Black and white races, prohibit forced labor and the buying and selling of human beings, and abolish the slavery system. As a result, Toussaint's army was also recognized and greatly reorganized, and finally became a new-style and very well-organized team.</p>
<p>After obtaining France's recognition of the equal rights of the Black and white races, Toussaint saw clearly the changes in the situation at that time and immediately abandoned Spain and cooperated with France again. However, several upper-level leaders of the Black people who relied on the Spanish royalists wanted to continue to oppose France and opened fire on Toussaint. In this struggle, Toussaint resolutely led the Black people to resist and won the final victory. Later, due to British intervention, he fought with Britain again. As a result, he signed such a treaty with Britain: 1. Britain supplies Santo Domingo Island with necessary daily necessities, clothing, medicines, etc.; 2. Britain retains the right to station troops in any place in Santo Domingo, and the Santo Domingo government should give possible convenience to the British army; 3. Toussaint has the obligation to protect the lives and property of all British people; 4. Britain and Santo Domingo maintain long-term friendly relations. In this way, although Santo Domingo was still not completely independent, the oppression suffered by the general Black people here was much better than in the past. Therefore, the Black people of Santo Domingo greatly admired Toussaint. His prestige was similar to that of Napoleon in France during his heyday, so he was called the Black Napoleon.</p>
<p>Later, due to the great development of American power in the Americas, Santo Domingo had long been freed from the shackles of the British and relied on the United States. Now, Santo Domingo can be said to be a protectorate of the United States. However, even under the current circumstances, as long as the name of the independent hero of Santo Domingo, the Black Napoleon Toussaint, is mentioned, the local white people are still a little frightened, although this hero has long been dead.</p>
<p>Training and Self-cultivation</p>
<h3>Managing Affairs</h3>
<p>— Meng He</p>
<p>When two different people do the same thing, the effort and time spent are the same. However, the final result is completely different. This is the reason for the different efficiency. The so-called efficiency is that it takes less effort and accomplishes more. How can we achieve the highest efficiency? Countless scientists have racked their brains over this question, so we cannot ignore it.</p>
<p>It is certainly a virtue to manage affairs bravely, but if you do not know how to handle affairs effectively, even if you do not waste your efforts in vain, you will inevitably achieve little success and make many mistakes. Here, I will try to describe the principles of effective management:</p>
<p>1.  Agility</p>
<p>If a person with extensive knowledge and rich judgment is unable to take further agile action, he will sit and wait for the opportunity to pass by in an instant and accomplish nothing. Therefore, the world is vast, and people are stimulated by the environment to the greatest extent, but each person's ability is different, and the methods of coping are also different. Those who are good at coping must be agile in their actions. The King of Spain challenged Henry, and Henry resolutely said to his envoy: "Please tell your master to pay attention, before he steps on the stirrup, I will be high in the saddle!" Henry can be said to be a person of agile action.</p>
<p>The effects of agile action are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Handy If, after agile judgment of external stimuli, agile action follows, then no matter how big the matter is, you will never be at a loss and unable to cope.</p>
<p>2.  Every Shot Counts Those who can respond quickly can make every shot count. Military strategists often use the so-called "narrowest of margins" to launch surprise attacks to win victories. If you do not use agile means, you will inevitably miss the military opportunity and cause hidden dangers.</p>
<p>3.  Seize Every Opportunity People who are agile in action encounter opportunities anytime and anywhere; on the contrary, people who are slow in action often sigh that "opportunities do not come to me." In fact, the nature of opportunity is like a fleeting wind and lightning.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Therefore, although opportunities come like a string of pearls in succession, slow and numb people must be unable to cope. Only those who are agile in action can seize every opportunity and gain the magic of application.</p>
<p>However, the "agility" we are talking about is a "decision" made after "judgment." Perhaps some people's actions are agile, but they do not have sufficient judgment, or even no judgment at all. That can only be called "reckless" and "hasty," and is not enough to be called agility!</p>
<p>The reason for the lack of agility is often the lack of resolute courage and strong will. Unnecessary concerns and fears are constantly swirling in the mind, causing oneself to be distracted and lose the opportunity for success.</p>
<p>2.  Creativity</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen once classified human beings into three classes. One is the inability to create. But since a person lives in this era and this society, he naturally cannot be completely unaffected by this era and this society, but only those who can use the present era and the present society as the basis for their own existence and expand their wisdom can be considered accomplished figures.</p>
<p>Those who bow their heads and cling to the shackles of established methods and cannot extricate themselves from them, I really feel sorry for their life's work, and I also feel sorry for the loss of talent in human society.</p>
<p>Although creativity has a great relationship with innate intelligence, it also relies on human efforts. Here are the main points:</p>
<p>1.  Must Have Much Contact (Openness to Impressions) Cassatt, the manager of the Pennsylvania Company in the United States, talked to and questioned the various employees of the company at any time when he was working in the company. He treated the servants and laborers with a kind attitude and communicated with them, so he deeply understood the advantages and disadvantages of the various departments of the company, in order to make plans for transformation. In the history of our country, it is also common to see enlightened prefects and governors visiting the people incognito and asking the old farmers in the streets for advice on governance, in order to correct the direction of administration.</p>
<p>2.  Seek Novelty There was a person who usually paid attention to collecting advertisements and accumulated seven hundred feet of them. He took the advantages of these advertisements and discarded the disadvantages, and then used his own new ideas to draw advertisements, all of which were novel and unique, and became a famous advertising artist.</p>
<p>3.  Experience People must be able to focus on the small details. If we travel, are in nature, or are in books, and have a deep understanding of all that we see and hear, we will definitely increase countless valuable experiences.</p>
<p>4.  Concentration</p>
<p>Emerson said: "In life, that one thing called 'prudence' is 'concentration,' and that one thing called bad thing is 'dispersion.'"</p>
<p>In war, a scheming officer must discover the weaknesses in the enemy's defense line, and then concentrate all his forces to attack this weakness. For affairs, you must also have concentrated energy, and strive with all your energy to achieve the success of the affairs. People with concentrated spirit get great strength, and people with scattered spirit get weak strength. We must pay attention to this.</p>
<p>At any one time, you can only take care of one more important thing. Wilson once said that he only had one "single-mindedness," which means concentration.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for concentration is to develop the habit of concentration first. This habit is very easy to develop. Just gather the attention that is scattered in all directions, like a concave mirror gathers sunlight into a focus under the sunlight. To develop this habit, you can proceed simultaneously from the following two aspects:</p>
<p>1.  Restraint of One's Own Mind – Self-control. This belongs to the spiritual aspect.</p>
<p>2.  Use the method of planning to do things to help concentrate. You must have a prescribed schedule of activities every day, step by step. In your prescribed time, concentrate your spirit, only do the prescribed things, and reject all complicated thoughts outside of your mind. If one thing is not finished, you must not want to devote your energy to the second thing.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Road Protection Troops</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>When the train passes the Pinghan Railway, whether at large or small stations, one can always see many armed comrades holding guns at attention on the platform, facing the train. Those are the soldiers of the road protection troop. They stand there respectfully, with a purpose, which is called "greeting the train."</p>
<p>"Greeting the train," this task does not seem to require much effort, but those who have done it know its bitterness. Veterans prefer drills, errands, or even "building public works" (i.e., building trenches, etc.), but they do not like "greeting the train." Taking large stations as an example, such as Zhengzhou, Baoding, Changxindian, express and special express trains stop for forty minutes each time. The soldiers must stand there to greet the train before it enters the station, and they can only rest after seeing the train off. As for slow trains and mixed passenger-freight trains (such as train number 72), they stay even longer because loading and unloading goods takes at least two hours; if they also have to give way to other trains, then there will be a delay of three hours. In this long period, one can really stand until drowsy. Of course, greeting the train is not entirely about standing there respectfully. One can also carry a gun and walk around on the platform, but after a process of three or four hours, one's legs will also become weak.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of train greetings is fixed at six times a day, sometimes up to eight or nine times. Although the names of the trains vary depending on the location of the station—on the north bank of the Yellow River (from Xinxiang to Baoding) there are "train 52" and "train 51," while on the south bank (from Xinxiang to Hankou) there are no such trains, but there are "train 61" and "train 62"—the number of times they pass each day is the same. Of these six times, four are passenger trains, two of which are special express or express trains (according to the Pinghan Railway's regulations, express trains run on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, while special express trains run on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays), and two are slow trains. The remaining two are the most annoying mixed passenger-freight trains. Greeting and sending off the four passenger trains takes about four hours, while the two mixed trains take at least five hours, totaling no less than nine hours of standing time for greeting trains throughout the day. However, in addition to "passenger trains" and "mixed trains," there are also "extra trains" and "coal trains" that must be greeted and sent off. Standing for such a long time, no matter how strong one's legs are, one will feel very tired.</p>
<p>Of course, trains do not arrive continuously, but it is precisely because of the intervals in time that it feels troublesome. Often, after seeing off a train, just as one hangs up the gun, puts on the ammunition pouch, unties the leggings, and prepares to take a nap, before one can even close one's eyes, one hears the station's bell ringing "clang, clang, clang" (when a train is about to leave the first station, the third station rings the bell to give advance notice; whether it is coming from the south or the north can be distinguished from the sound of the bell). This sound makes one dare not oversleep. After another half an hour or so, one hears the "huaya huaya" sound in the ticket office, which means that the "road permit" is being sent, reporting that the train has departed from the second station. So, one quickly puts on the leggings (most of the time they have not been taken off), bullets, puts on the military cap, picks up that troublesome gun, and runs to the platform, lining up in a row, waiting for the train to make a long, wild cry, and pounce into the "flag" (about fifty yards from the platform) like a long snake, and then does the usual posture of holding a gun at attention. So, once, twice, ... the whole day is spent preparing to greet the train and officially greeting the train.</p>
<p>If it is in spring or autumn, that doesn't matter so much, at most only straining the lower back and legs, but when summer comes, one cannot help but "feel sorrow from within": the flat platform seems to absorb heat especially easily, it is like a hot pot, and people standing on it are like fried pancakes. In fact, hot weather is still relatively easy to endure, but winter is unspeakably painful. The Pinghan Railway is mostly located in the north, and the climate is very cold. The soldiers of the road protection troop must go to the station to greet the train in any weather. Sometimes, the north wind is biting, and heavy snow is falling, and the snow on the ground is frozen into thick ice. Standing in the open air for one or two hours will freeze the whole body until it loses sensation. Especially at night, the suffering is even greater, the wilderness wind, and the surrounding night, all add to the chill.</p>
<p>However, this is the situation when stationed at a large station. If stationed at a small station, it is much easier because although the number of train stops is the same, the stopping time is very short: when a passenger train arrives at the station, it only lets out a big breath, and after changing the road permit (when a train stops at a station, the stationmaster must issue a road permit before it can depart, one station changes one station, to avoid two trains colliding), it can depart. If calculated in terms of time, it takes at most four minutes. Even when mixed trains and coal trains arrive, because there is no loading or unloading of goods at small stations, they do not stay for long. Sometimes, even if they have to give way to passenger trains in front and behind, they only stop for an hour or so at most. Therefore, being able to be stationed at a small station is what all the soldiers of the road protection troop hope for. They neither drill nor attend lectures every day, and the time for greeting the train is so short. If they don't gamble or smoke opium, it is difficult to pass the time. At the same time, the road protection troop is based on a squad as a unit, and most of those stationed at small stations are a squad. Although the squad leader is a major general in one area, responsible for discipline, he is not an officer after all, and the brothers are very free. However, this kind of enjoyment does not last long. At most, they have to rotate once a month or two, otherwise the competition for power will inevitably turn into a scene of fighting for fish.</p>
<p>In addition to greeting trains and protecting the safety of passengers, the soldiers of the road protection troop also have the responsibility of preventing damage to the railway and clearing bandits (in the vicinity of the railway). If it is a "peaceful world, a bright universe," it doesn't matter, but if bandits rise up, the work will be much heavier; they have to add double sentries during the day, and constantly patrol around the station day and night (trains are mostly robbed when they stop at the station, otherwise even if the bandits have three heads and six arms, there is no way to do it). A squad at a small station, and at most three squads at a large station, no matter how they are rotated and assigned, the amount of work is too much to relax. In addition, banditry is especially prevalent on the Pinghan Railway, especially on the south bank of the Yellow River, with bandit alarms almost twice every three days, making the protectors of the railway exhausted. So, they have a "maxim" like this: "To be stationed, one must be stationed on the north bank of the Yellow River."</p>
<p>But being stationed on the north bank is not so fun either. If stationed in a coal-producing area near Zhangde, there is also the task of "escorting coal trains." Here, coal must be loaded to the south every day (mostly to Hankou), and there are many "coal thieves" along the way, requiring an armed comrade to suppress them. The police officers escorting the coal stand on the open coal car all day long with guns and live ammunition. Their prestige is indeed impressive, but they inevitably suffer from wind, rain, and sun exposure (coal cars are all open, with only a "guard car" for the staff to live in. To prevent coal thieves from getting on the car halfway, the police officers escorting the coal must stand on the coal pile to take care of everything), and the coal car runs very slowly. From Zhangde to Hankou and back, it takes six or seven days in total. In such a long time, the suffering is difficult to describe. When people pass the Pinghan Railway, as long as they pay attention to the coal trains in operation, it is not difficult to see a gray figure in dirty clothes and a face full of coal dust, shrinking and standing on the coal pile. That is the protector of the coal, ensuring peace and tranquility along the way!</p>
<p>The price obtained by the officers and soldiers of the road protection troop for their work is: 18 silver dollars per month for the squad leader (the salaries of non-commissioned officers and lower ranks are the same, there is no rank of sergeant first class), 12 yuan for the first-class soldier, 11 yuan for the second-class soldier, and "two-five makes ten" for the third-class soldier. Although this is not a "rich monthly income," they can be paid in full on time every month, so they are very motivated.</p>
<p>Whenever the payday is approaching (end of the month, or the first of next month), they often guess on the platform or in the ticket office: "The payday train may arrive today," or: "The payday train may have reached Changxindian." (The payday train usually departs from Beiping and distributes the money to each station in order). In fact, if the payday train has really departed from Beiping, the news can be spread to Hankou in less than three hours (relayed by telephone along the way, and the team that gets the news will pass it on to that team), but the payday train must be checked and distributed clearly before it can be opened to the second station, and the time is inevitably delayed, so the brothers are a little flustered, and quickly inquire by telephone to comrades at other stations: "Where has the payday train arrived? Why hasn't it arrived yet?"</p>
<p>After the salary is in hand, they all go crazy, forgetting the hard work of greeting the train, forgetting the fatigue of escorting coal, forgetting the hot sun, forgetting the freezing wind and snow, taking advantage of their free time. Sacrificing sleep, they sneak into taverns, sneak into brothels, chattering and arguing happily:</p>
<p>"A pound of bai gan! Braised pork belly!"</p>
<p>"Second girl, come over here! Why can't I see little ×?"</p>
<p>The world is turned upside down. The money earned by blood and sweat for a month is stuffed into the pockets of the tavern owner or the arms of a small-footed girl (most of the local prostitutes on the Pinghan Railway are small-footed), and then the whole body feels light and airy!</p>
<p>But, if not for "the old generals taking care of us," how would the "earthworms" (i.e., local prostitutes) on the Pinghan Railway live?</p>
<p>Scientific Miscellany</p>
<h3>Two Large Meteors</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhi</p>
<p>—Translated from the Esperanto Scientific Magazine (Scienca Gazeto)—</p>
<p>In the space between the stars, there are countless rocks of different sizes and types, which constantly follow the orbits of nearby planets and fruits, and drift in the universe according to gravity. In their movement, these rocks often encounter planets, stars or satellites and fall down, which is called "meteor". "Meteor" is the popular name of "meteorite", this popular name is not very appropriate, because "meteorite" is really not a "star". The biggest difference between the two is the size problem. The diameter of a "star" can reach more than one million kilometers, while the diameter of a "meteorite" may only be one meter, or even only one centimeter.</p>
<p>In its drifting, a meteorite often encounters the air above the earth, and at the same time generates heat due to the friction of the air, until the heat reaches the focal point or boiling point. If it is a large meteorite, it may fall directly to the ground with a loud sound; or it may burn up midway, but in any case, we can still see a flash of light in the sky.</p>
<p>Meteorites fall to the earth at different speeds, the fastest can reach about forty kilometers per second. As for the number of meteorites falling on the ground, it is said that there are millions of them in just one day, and some may even be very large, and the earth increases its weight by hundreds of millions of grams every day in this way.</p>
<p>Most of the meteorites we commonly see are very small, but sometimes very large ones fall down, two of which I want to talk about here.</p>
<p>In the plains of Arizona in the southwestern United States, near Canon Diablo, there is a famous volcanic crater called Coon Butte. It is 1,370 meters in diameter, 180 meters in depth, and its walls rise about 30 meters above the plain. It is said that in prehistoric times, a large meteorite fell in this place, sinking very deep into the ground, thus forming this volcanic crater. This fact has long been considered credible by general scientists. For twenty years, the exploration work has never stopped. Finally, after using electrical methods to test it, the location of the meteorite has been roughly explored. According to the results of the exploration, it is known that the meteorite is embedded below the southwest corner of this volcanic crater, at a depth of 210 meters. Then, after a series of drilling and tunneling efforts, these scientists discovered the hard part of the meteorite (i.e., meteoric iron) at a depth of 200 meters; because of this meteoric iron with characteristic properties, they recognized that it was a meteorite. This discovery gave us an inspiration, so that we can make the same explanation for the many volcanic craters on the moon. The above-mentioned Arizona volcanic crater has many similarities with the moon, only the size is somewhat different. It is not difficult for us to think that in the early years of the moon, many meteorites fell on the moon, thus forming many volcanic craters. As for the Arizona volcanic crater, it is estimated to have been 50,000 years since its formation. As for the materials describing it, needless to say, they cannot be obtained; all we can imagine is the deafening bombardment sound at that time, the firelight that illuminated the sky, and the terror in the hearts of the aborigines.</p>
<p>On June 30, 1908, a very large, far-reaching meteorite fell in Siberia. Although it had broken into pieces before hitting the ground, it was indeed very huge. It is said that the forest blown down by that gust of wind at that time occupied an area of 115 kilometers in diameter; at the same time, it (meteorite) also emitted a series of loud noises, as if many cannons were being fired continuously. According to people who witnessed the situation at that time, the light it emitted was as bright as the sun, and its pillar of fire was even as long as 96 kilometers; its heat was very high, and the wind was also very strong.</p>
<p>(Translator's note: There is a place called Dashitou Lane in Suzhou, and a large meteorite fell there many years ago, hence the name. It is said that the stone is still in the house of a certain surname in that port.)</p>
<p>However, to put it another way, even if some meteorites are very large, a meteorite is ultimately not a star. It is probably only a part of a shattered comet, or shattered material from an already formed planetary system.</p>

<h3>Review of the Great Scientist Jeans' "The New Background of Science"</h3>
<p>— She Weng</p>
<p>Jeans is a world-renowned modern scientist, one of the top astronomers and physicists in the United Kingdom, and a mathematics lecturer at Cambridge University. His works are all very recent scientific achievements, and are not just technical descriptions of facts, but have been thought over, and based on his own philosophical insights, have been deeply theoretically explained, and used theory to organize his scientific works. The scientific facts explored, discussed, and described in them are all very novel and profound scientific discoveries, which is useless to describe in detail. Now, leaving aside other works, let's just critique his famous work "The New Background of Science," which was only published in 1933. The Chinese translation of this book was published by Xinken Bookstore last year, translated by Mr. Tan Fuzhi. This book does contain many valuable and rich scientific materials, and anyone who studies science, or even wants to know the latest inventions and the theoretical development of science in recent years, must read it. However, with a huge work of 200,000 words, and the scope of scientific facts discussed is very wide, it is really impossible to present those scientific facts and their theories in such a small book review for examination. Therefore, here I will only briefly criticize the philosophical viewpoint he used to connect his entire theory, and do a small critique of a big topic, which may be a little contribution to the readers. Because in order to understand the recent development of science, one cannot but read this book, but the errors of his philosophical viewpoint cannot be accepted by us, so it is necessary to point out his shortcomings slightly, so as to avoid readers being confused by his erroneous theory.</p>
<p>Continued on page five</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>is quite necessary.</p>
<p>The thought expressed by Jeans in this book is entirely a viewpoint of idealistic pure empiricism and free will, so he uses two basic thoughts to connect the narration of his entire scientific theory. The first basic thought is that all new scientific facts are constantly modifying the conclusions about the outside world that have been known since ancient times, and the structure and laws of the objective material world that have been recognized since ancient times are being broken and denied step by step by research. Therefore, he feels that those things can only be regarded as the combination of the psychological feelings and experiential elements of the scientists themselves in those times, and are not the true laws of the outside world. That is to say, the scientific achievements of the past are the imaginations of individual psychological experiences, so it is constantly shaken in new research. So, what about the new scientific discoveries? It is still following the old path, and it is still the new scientists who make new explanations based on their own psychological experiences and feelings. Because according to historical instructions, these established facts and rules will also shatter its firmness before the new research of successors, and change from rational to irrational. In this way, our objective knowledge only relies on the synthesis of each person's own experiential elements, and we think we have recognized the objective, but in fact we have not recognized the objective, so the truth of the external world is unknowable to us in the end. We think that we have already known the essence of the material world, but in fact it is not the truth of the material world, but only the illusion of the combination of psychological elements. There are many examples of such opinions, for example, in the first chapter "The Way to Approach the Outside World," he first said this: "The old philosophy lost its function at the end of the nineteenth century, and the scientists of the twentieth century forged a new philosophy for themselves. The main point is that physicists no longer regard nature as something completely separate from themselves. Sometimes it is created, or chosen, or abstracted by itself; sometimes it is something he has destroyed." Why is this so? Because, for example, observing a rainbow, "everyone's rainbow is a choice of his own eyes." Therefore, although "in any case, this does not mean to imply that an objective nature does not exist, but it does mean that objective nature is now beyond our ability. We can only see the nature blurred by the clouds of dust we ourselves create." Why does Jeans doubt the ability of science and deny that all the laws obtained by science are objective things of nature? It is because he sees that the new quantum theory, electron theory, relativity, uncertainty principle, etc., are breaking step by step the absolute mass view, movement view, time and space view, mechanical causality, determinism, etc., that were considered to be true objective phenomena and laws in the past. But Jeans does not know that, first, although the scientific laws of the past also have many illusory components, it cannot be said that there is no discovery of true natural laws in them at all. Although the more in-depth research of modern science has also modified it, what it modifies can only be the erroneous part, not overturning the whole of it, and what it supplements is only supplementing its defects, not absolutely opposite to it. For example, for the law of the indestructibility of matter, although in the past, when it was applied to the observation of individual things, it was erroneously given an absolute meaning, but it cannot be said that the undiminishing nature of the total amount of matter in the universe is also wrong. Modern new physics believes that the law of the indestructibility of matter is no longer applicable. In our opinion, it is those scientists themselves who are blinded by the viewpoint of idealism, and the result of misunderstanding the new scientific materials. As for all new discoveries, if we do not hastily make judgments, and can correctly recognize and deal with them from the viewpoint of the new philosophy, then it is enough to prove everywhere the objective existence of the material world and the correctness of that new worldview of its dynamic change process.</p>
<p>Because Jeans is a sensationist or empiricist, because he is an agnostic of Kant's thought (even if he also admits the existence of the thing-in-itself like Kant), so he naturally entered the second basic theory from the idea that all knowledge does not come from the objective world, that is, he entered the theory of free will. So he everywhere sings the uncertainty principle, the probability law, and denies the causal determinism. He believes that everything can have many uncertain paths that can be chosen, such as if the position of an electron can be measured, its velocity cannot be measured at the same time, and thermodynamics discovered the first law, but then a second law was created to indicate that there is no reversible process in the conversion of energy, so he said that "as long as one believes that the natural world is mechanical, and thus determined, then the above speculation will not be allowed after all." The freedom of choice has unlimited authority in his mind, so he regards people who advocate that "the possibility of indeterminacy should not be allowed for the natural world, and that man and nature are just mechanical cogs, and this machine only drives towards its predetermined end," as "extremists," and also takes an attitude of disbelief towards Planck and Einstein's denial of free will. Of course, pure mechanism is also what we oppose, but in any case, free will cannot be found even in human beings, let alone the inorganic natural world. Jeans gives modern science idealism, and thus believes that "at the last place reached today, most or even almost all of the non-spiritual things have been dissolved, and no new things can emerge from the non-spiritual things." Then the whole universe is spiritualized and fantasized, what is Jeans still studying? Isn't this scientific work in vain? You use free will to arbitrarily choose, choose all the roads to walk randomly, and also use free will to construct all the patterns of the universe, then Jeans' great work itself loses its objectivity and scientific value, and who can it preach to? In the empty world of psychology, everything is just psychological images, Jeans himself is afraid that he cannot be determined as a person or a ghost, because you yourself can also be regarded as an arbitrarily fantasized object.</p>
<p>In short, although we cannot deny the scientific materials provided by Jeans' work, he uses the materials to accommodate his own distorted viewpoint, so in the theoretical aspect, that is, in the philosophical aspect, it is completely wrong. Readers should be careful to avoid being misled by his theory into the wrong path of thought.</p>

<p>— Pu Yu</p>
<p>Sitting in the car, my mind was repeating the same thoughts: What exactly should I do today? Will things go smoothly? ...Actually, there is no official business at all! It's just because the Director sent a quick letter yesterday, telling me to restrain the staff from acting recklessly, as the rumors from the provincial office are not good. Old Bin said: It was precisely because of this sentence that I became concerned, and that's why today's "investigation" is happening; I understand that behind "the rumors are not good," there's instability in position, and I understand this very well. Think about it, if you don't quickly make some money, what will you find in the future? Fortunately, the Director won't be back for a while; maybe he's working the connections, so it's perfect for secretly doing a deal. But when it comes to making money, it's not easy either. People with status like us can't just kidnap people. So, I couldn't sleep all night, tossing and turning until I thought of it: Yuan Tai's business is relatively good, and he has enough capital. It won't matter to him to be overcharged a bit; fortunately, the liquor we issued the other day didn't have the tax certificate collected yet... This morning, I got up at five o'clock, instructing the clerk to write the red form while also telling Jiang Xi-wu to collect the seals from the accounting office. Think about it, if I wasn't trying to make money for myself, who would want to go through all this trouble? If it was really for "official business," I could just send any revenue officer.</p>
<p>Speaking of wanting "money," it's not really my nature. Honestly, in my student days, I hated tax collectors the most. Everyone knows that during the pawnshop committee affair, I was the one who made the biggest fuss. Even when I first got into the officialdom, I didn't really change my old ways much; whenever I saw those officials swallowing people whole, I was always filled with disgust. But in recent years, having experienced more of the world, I realized that money is really valuable; with it, careers can be developed. For example, I only had a slight connection with the Director at first, and he even looked down on me then. But when he was in charge of the tobacco and alcohol bureau, he needed two thousand dollars for entertainment expenses, and he was short of funds and very anxious. Seeing that his matter had a good chance of success, I volunteered to lend him five hundred dollars. Because of that, he thought I was a good friend, gave me a thumbs up immediately, and appointed me as director the next day – verbally, of course. You see how great the effect of this "five hundred dollars" was; I not only made a well-connected friend but also became a "director," albeit a small one. Actually, I don't even need such a big analogy; even for having fun, you need money to do it well. Hmph, I dare to say one thing to you in Yang County: Zhang, the section chief of the county government, and Wang, the stamp tax director, are not as popular as I am; it's not because of my high position or good looks, but really because I'm willing to spend some money!</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I feel a bit ashamed: the way I schemingly try to make money is also to make up for these shortcomings. Officially, I am a "director," but my actual salary is only forty dollars. This pitiful amount isn't even enough for my wife to sew pants. Think about it, how can we survive without finding other sources of income? The day before yesterday, she went to gamble again, losing twenty dollars in cash and borrowing fifty dollars from Mrs. Peng. I advised her to hold off on paying, but she scolded me for being shameless. Damn it, she doesn't even think about me: After being a director for a year, I've only saved two thousand nine hundred dollars. If I lose my job one day, what can I do with this little money?</p>
<p>Thinking about my future, I feel a chill run down my spine. My only hope right now is that the Director's position doesn't change – getting promoted would be good – and that things go smoothly today. To tell you the truth, I really don't have the bad intention of digging for a golden doll. Just two hundred dollars would be enough to temporarily fulfill three wishes: One, pay off my wife's gambling debts. Two, make the number in the bankbook a round '3000.' Three, buy some accessories for Little Zi-hong. – God knows, that girl really has a way of captivating people. – Thinking about it, it's really pathetic. After all the calculations, it's just a mere 'two hundred.' In Yuan Tai's huge capital, what's that? But nine out of ten businessmen are 'cunning.' Getting his money is like taking his life. However, Yuan Tai's second father, Li, is relatively easy to deal with. I figured out his personality the first time!</p>

<h3>Star Semi-Monthly Magazine Volume 3, Issue 3 Published</h3>

<h3>"Special Detective" to be Released</h3>
<p>It is a sister piece to "G-Men"</p>
<p>The Grand Guangming Theater, since the opening of Paramount's blockbuster "All-Star Cast," has been experiencing crowded screenings due to the film's fascinating and innovative content. After the screening of "All-Star Cast," the theater initially planned to screen "Aguk's Turbulence" and "Adventure in the Antarctic." However, due to special circumstances, it has been decided to screen "Special Agent" instead. This film is Warner Brothers' sister piece to "G-Men," and director William Keighley is also the director of "G-Men." The film depicts a female hero who bravely goes to arrest a group of lawless thugs. "G-Men" is about G-Men, while "Special Detective" is about T-Men. The intensity of the fighting is even greater in the latter.</p>
<h3>"The Mystery of Tibet" to be Performed</h3>
<p>Most Chinese people are Buddhists, and the Buddhist stronghold is in Tibet. In Tibet, Buddhists are all over the land, and the highest authority is also a Buddhist. Therefore, Tibet is called a Buddhist country, and Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, is also called a Buddhist capital.</p>
<p>Buddhism has many mysteries, and Tibet, due to inconvenient transportation and cultural backwardness, has become a mysterious place. However, Tibet's natural beauty and rich mineral resources have attracted the ambitions of imperialists. In recent years, our government has paid attention to the development of the frontier, including mysterious Tibet. Therefore, Mr. Huang Musong was sent to Tibet, and the Yueming Company organized a photographic team to capture the mysteries of Tibet on film.</p>
<p>After the Yueming photography team returned from Tibet, they spent several months organizing the footage. The first film, titled "The Mystery of Tibet," is nearing completion and will soon be officially released. The mystery of Tibet, all sorts of unexpected mysteries, will soon be revealed to you. Please wait and see.</p>
