<h3>日俄關係之緊張及其影響</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>日俄關係自本年七八月間所謂日「滿」蒙談判破裂以來即呈密雲不雨之象而日本關東軍之對俄敵視更使兩國邦交由潛在的杌隍演進爲表面化的衝突本年九月下旬日駐津多田司令發表小冊子鼓吹防俄十一月十八日日外相廣田提出成立「中日共同防共陣線」之原則於是日本外務省與軍都對俄問題之態度已完全一致而日本對蘇俄方面之武力的威脅行爲遂更趨緊張矣</p>
<p>據蘇聯機關塔斯社電訊本月十九日日僞軍以武裝刧掠蒙古邊境幷戕殺及捕虜蒙古邊防軍達十六人外蒙當局對此已向偽方提出抗議同時據路透社消息察東沽源寶昌康保等縣已於日前完全被「滿軍」或親「滿」蒙軍所佔截至二十二日止爲察省重鎭之張北亦已被來自海拉爾之蒙兵所佔據內蒙異動之說雖未證實但僞軍李守信部之向內蒙移動企圖切斷內蒙與察省之聯絡以及某方正派出軍官多人往百靈廟活動則已成爲無可吾認之事實日僞軍此種積極的西侵與北進政策其目的在造成「滿」蒙以及華北之廣大反蘇陣綫亦屬彰彰明甚</p>
<p>因此種情勢之展開蘇聯方面之反日氣勢亦頓形高漲本月二十三日蘇聯西伯利亞伯力市民衆時向日本駐伯力領事館投石同時蘇聯政府領袖亦於二十四日接見太平洋艦隊將校詳　艦隊之情况及軍事政治之訓練此種軍事上之對壘形勢似已明白告訴世人倘日本節節進迫日俄戰事之發生將成爲無可避免之事實</p>
<p>基于日俄關係之緊張日方對我華北之控制自必更加積極佔據察東六縣其目的卽在隔斷中俄間之交通冀東僞戰區軍之進佔塘沽其目的在便利日方軍事上之運輸成立「華北防共會」其目的在獲得後方安全之保障凡此皆爲日軍處心積慮之對俄行爲而與我巾華民族尤有生死存亡之關係國人寗可不加以深切之注意耶</p>

<h3>國語科講演　閱讀甚麽</h3>
<p>— 開明書店編譯部主任夏丐尊</p>
<p>中學生諸君，我在這回播音所擔任的是中學國語科的節目。國語科有好幾個方面，我想對諸君講的是些關於閱讀方面的話。預備分兩次講，次講「一閱讀甚麼」，一决講「怎樣閱讀」。今天先講「閱讀甚麼」。</p>
<p>讓我在未講到正文以前，先發一句荒唐的議論，我以為書這東西是有消滅的一天的。書只是供給知識的一種工具，供給知識，其實並不一定要靠書。試想人類的歷史不知已有多少年，書的歷史比較起來是很短很短的。太古的時代並沒有書，可是人類也竟能生活下來。他們的知識原不及近代人，却也不能說全沒有知識。足見書不是知識的唯一的來源，要得知識，並不一定要靠書的了。古代的事，我們只要好憑想像來說，或者有些不可靠。再看現在的情形吧。今天的講演，是用無綫電播送給諸君聽的。假定諸君之中聽的有一萬人，如果我講得好，有益於諸君，那就效力等於一萬個人各讀了一册「讀書法」或「讀書指導」等類的書了。我們　在除　綫電以外，還有電影可以利用。歷史上的事件，科學上的製造，如果用電影來演出，功效等於讀史書和科學書。假定有這麼一天，無綫電話和電影發達得很　步普遍，放送的材料有人好好編製，適於各種人的需要，那宋書的用處會逐漸消滅，因為這　利器已可以代　嘗了。我們因了想像如道太古時代沒　書，將來也可以不必有書，書的需要，可以說是一種過渡時代的現象。</p>
<p>今天所講的題目，是閱讀　麼」，方才這番議論，好像有些荒唐，文不對題，其實我的意思，只是想借此破除許多護書的錯誤觀念。我也承認書本在今日還是有用的，我們生存在今日，要求知識，最普通，最經濟的方法還是讀書。可是一向傳下來的讀書觀念，很有許多是錯誤的。有些人把讀書認　高尙的風雅事悄，把書本當作玩好品，古董品，好像書這東西是與實際際生活無關，讀書是實際生活以外的消遺工作。有些人把書認為唯一的求學的工具，以為所謂求知識，就是讀書的別名，書本以外沒有知識的來路。這兩種觀念，都是錯誤，犯前一種錯誤的以一般人為多，犯後一種錯誤的大槪是靑年人，尤其是日日手揑書本的中學生諸君我。以為書只是求知識的工具之一。我們為了要生活，耍使生活的技能充實，就得求知識。所謂知識，决不是什麼裝飾品，只是用來應付生活，改逃生活的技能。醫如說：我們因為要在自然界中生存，要利用自然界，理解自然界的情形，才去學習物理，化學和算學科等科目。我們因為要在世界上做人，才去學習世界情形，修習世界史和世界地理等科目。我們因為要做現在的中國人民，才去學習本國歷史，地理，公民等科目。學習的方法可有各色各樣，有時須用實騐的方法，有時須用覜察的方法，有時須用演習方法，並不一定都依靠書。只因為書是用文字寫成的，文字是最使利的東西，可把世間一切的事情，一切的道理都記戰出來。印成了書，隨時隨地可以翻看。所以書就成了求知識的重要的工具，値得大家來閱讀了</p>
<p>以上是我對於書的估價，下面就要講到今天的題目閱讀甚麼一了。</p>
<p>靑年人應該讀些甚麼書？這是一個從古以來的大問題。對於這問題，從古就有許多人發表過許多議論。近十年來，這問題也着實熱鬧，有好幾位先生替靑年開過書目單，其中比較有名的是梁啟超先生和胡適之先生所開的單子。諸君之中想必有許多人見過這些單子的。我今天不想再替諸君　開單子，只想大略地吿訴諸君幾個着手的方向。</p>
<p>我想把讀書和生活兩件事聯成一氣，打成一片來說，在我的見解，讀書並不是風雅的勾當，是改進生活豐富生活的手段。書籍並不只是茶餘酒後的消遺品，乃是培　生活上知識技能的工具。一個人該讀些甚麼書，看些甚麼書，要依了他自己的生活來决定，來選擇。我主張把閱讀的範圍，分成一個。一，是關於自己的職務的。二，是參考用的。三，是關於趣味或修養的。舉例子來說：做內科醫生的人，第一應該要閱讀的是關於內科的書籍，雜誌，這是關於職務的閱讀，屬於第一類。次之是和自己的職務無直接關係，可以作研究上的參考，使自己的專門知識更豐富確切的書。如果道位醫生因了瘧疾的研究，而注意到蚊子的種類，便去翻某種生物學書，因了瘧蚊的分布便去翻閱某種地理書，因了某種藥物的性質，便去查檢某種的植物書，礦物書，因了某一詞兒的懷疑，便去翻查某種辭典，這是參考的閱讀，屬於第二類。再次之這位醫生除了醫生的職務以外，常然還有趣味或修養的生活。在趣味方面，他如果是喜歡下團棋的，不妨看看關於圍棋的書，如果是喜歡攝影的，不妨看看關於攝影的書，如果是喜歡文藝的，不妨看看詩歌小說一類的書。在修養方面，他如果是有志於品性的修鍊的，自然會去看名人傳記或經典格言等一類書，如果覺得自己身體非鍜鍊不可，自然會去看游泳運動等類的書。還是趣味或修養方面的閱讀，屬於第三類。第一類關於職務的書是各人不相同的，銀行家該閱讀的和工程師不同，農業家所該閱讀的和音樂家不同。第二類的參考書，是因了專門業務的研究隨時連類牽涉到的，也不能劃出一定的種數。至於第三類的關於趣味或修　的書，更該讓人自由分別選定。總而言之，讀書和生活，應該有密切的關係。</p>
<p>上面我把閱讀的範關分為一個，一，是關於個人職務的。二，是參考的。三，關於趣味或修養的。下面我將根據這幾個原則，對於中學生諸君講「閱讀　麼」的問題。</p>
<p>先講關於職務的閱讀，諸位的職務是甚麼呢？諸位是中學生，職務就在學習中學校的各種功課。諸君將來也許會做官更，做律師，開商店，做敎師，各有各的職務吧，現在却都在中學校受着中等敎育。把中學校所規定的各種功課，好好學習，就是諸君的職務了。諸君在職務上該閱讀的書，不是別的，就是學校規定的各種敎科書。諸位對於我這番話，也許會認為無聊吧，也許有人說，我們每日捧了敎科書上課堂下課堂，本來在天天和敎科書作伴侶，何必再要你來嘈雜呢？可是，我說這番話，自信態度是誠懇的。不瞞諸君說，我也會當過許多年的中學敎師，據我所曉得的情形，中學生裏面能够好好地閱讀敎科書的人並不十分多。有些中學生喜歡讀小說，隨便看雜誌，把敎科書丟在一邊，有些中學生，愛讀英文，或國文，看釗理化算學的書就頭痛。這顯然是一種偏向的壞現象。一般的學生雖然沒有這種偏向的情形，也是似乎未能充分地利用敎科書。敎科書專為學習而編，所記載的只是各種學科的大綱，原並不是甚麼了不得的著作，但對於學習還是有價値的工具。學習一種功課，應該以敎科書為幕礎，再從各方面加以擴充，加以比較觀察證明等種種切實的功夫，並非胡亂閱讀幾遍就可了事。舉例來說，國語科的讀本，通常是用幾篇選文編成的，假定一册國文讀本共有三十篇文章，你光是把三十篇文章讀過幾遍，還是不够，你應該依據了這些文章作種種進一步的學習。如文法上的習慣咧，修詞上的方式咧，斷句和分段的式樣咧，諸如此類的事項，你都須依據了這些文章來學習，收得扼要的知識才行。僅僅記牢了文章中所記的幾個故事或幾種議論，不能算學過國語　科的。再舉一個例來說，算學敎科書裏面有許多習題，你得一個一個地練習，這些習題一方面是定理或原則的實際上的應用，一方面是使你對於已經學過的學理或原則更加明瞭的。例如四則問題有種種花樣，　鶴算咧，時計算咧，父子年歲算咧，你如果只演習了一個個的習題，而不能發見這些習題中的共通的關係或法則，也不好稱為巳　會了四則。依照道條件來說，閱讀敎科書，並非容易簡單的工作了。中學科目有十幾門，每門的敎科書先該平均地好好閱讀，因為學習道些科目，是諸君現在的職務。（未完）</p>

<h3>農村生活叢談</h3>
<p>— 俞慶棠主編　楊衣水</p>
<p>四、山民耕種杉木山的生活形態</p>
<p>先講杉木山。</p>
<p>杉木山就是種有杉木的山。杉木大槪要二十年可以長大成材，成材以後，杉木一般都是包賣給商人去雇人砍伐，製作，搬運，再賣給杭滬的行家。山主大都並不自己經營。杉木全部下山以後，就可以種苞蘿和桐子，於是山塲租佃就開始第一步。山民自己沒有山，他的住家週圍又沒有田，一切衣食全靠從山上的勞動結果得來。因此，山民對於在他們附近有一塊山可以出租的消息，眞是比任何都還要要緊的事情！因為山塲的面積一般都是非常大，山主並不細分零散的出租，山民沒有獨家經營的力量，所以必須連合附近村落數十家或百家以上的佃戶去租佃。但是又恐自己在這决承佃名單中落空了，他們在租佃未成交以前，常常要備一些禮物—如鷄蛋等去送送山主。希望山主在出佃時特別垂靑，把他的名字開在承佃名單上。結果呢，山民大家都送禮物，山主倒樂得先有一批收穫，出佃時大家都垂靑，反使得山的租價可以更抬高一點了。</p>
<p>出佃時候，山主並不要承佃山民全體來負責，他從山民當選中出幾個比較富裕的農民來做「佃頭」。「佃頭」對山主一方負責代為索租，監督種杉苗，照應一切，眞比山主自己都還要體貼周到。同時另一面也從中取得傭金的回扣。租佃條件一般都是租期五年，最多六年，期滿完山，不准再種。租分錢租物租二種。除納租外，山民有無代價代為種杉義務。預備山荒後，杉木成林，到第二十年又可以包賣。錢租租價以第一年的收穫金為標準，大約每担出租錢二元—三元，在成交時侯一次繳納，以後不再出租。可是這第一年的繳納錢租條件，在一般沒有什麼收入的貧苦農民，實在是一個極大的困難。他們每把家具耕牛全部典質乾凈，有時也還凑不足數。所以他們大都願意償納物租，物租是在每年收穫時候三七分拆（山主三成）。當收穫前十日，由「佃頭」到山主家通知收穫日期。届期前一日恭請山主光降山塲，巡閱一周，證明有吾未納租而先自收穫的「妄舉」，杉苗有吾很規則的種植。經允准以後，次日，山民卽會同全體佃戶同時上山。這時候，山主卽安然坐鎭山民的茅草窠裏，靜待分得山民從懸崖絕壁上收穫歸來的苞蘿，山主呵，好像有皇帝一般的威風！</p>
<p>當山主到茅草窠裏分租的時候，山民平日所養的猪和鷄，就在這個時候專為山主宰殺而拿來欵待山主的；平日所種小而積的稻子，也在這個時候專為山主變成白米，拿來供奉山主的；平日往山中採集到的一點「山貨」，也在這個時候拿出來孝敬山主了。山主等到租分完功以後，於是，肚子裏裝滿食物，筐籮裏盛滿苞蘿，坐在轎中，監督着山民代他輸送到自己的家中去。</p>
<p>第二年又是照樣一套，第三年……第五年，杉木成林，期滿完山。</p>
<p>山民住在茅草窠裏吃糊喝湯，山主回到家中計算：這一週轉的租息比上一週轉多了多少？</p>
<p>五、山民經營柴樓山的生活形態</p>
<p>再來看看柴　山。</p>
<p>柴　山是不能種植的，所以，這種山可以說是長期放荒。因為土薄多石，所以大規模的出租是沒有的。柴　山對於山中的用處是，山上的雜柴野木經過十年以上的期間，成林以後可以燒炭。經營燒炭事業的也是商人。商人從山主處包買了這部柴木，雇工砍伐，燒煉，運輸，自然全部工作都得山民來動手。山民從商人處取得微薄的工資，商人從山民身上取得汗血作利潤，山主坐在家中分得一部分利潤作山價（柴價）。</p>
<p>柴木沒有成林以前，山主要防偷竊或失火燒山，須得雇人在山脚長年的看守。這種雇傭制度是典型的中世紀式的。雇人看守山塲並不限定是某山民一人，山主雇的是某一山民的全家，有時是某一山民的全村落（最大不過十家）。這種山民受雇以後，並不收受山主的工資，他們只能在這塊看守的山脚，選擇一方比較泥土厚些的地上或者山腰，種植一些必要的食物。他們也可以到這山上去斫伐一點必耍的樹木來蓋造幾間茅草窠。住的是山中的地，蓋的是山主的草木，因此，這個茅草窠也當然是屬於山主的，目前不過是在看守期間「暫住」而已。被雇山民對山主有整日整夜留心山上一草一木的動靜的義務，一年四季有經常向山主報吿山塲狀態的義務，報吿的時候有供奉「山貨」當禮物的義務。山上何處長了一顆樹可以給山主家中修猪欄，何處被山洪冲毀了一個缺口，被雇山民須隨時隨刻跑到山主前面去稟吿。山主家中農忙或者要找人做工的時候，被雇山民卽刻須跑去無代價的服役。山主滿意了，准他長期雇傭，吾則，連逼「苦差」都沒有資格。</p>
<p>山民，就是用這樣的紐帶！鏈條吧！和山主聯繫着遇生活。</p>
<p>我們離開這個桃源吧！這是中國號稱富庶，文化前進的浙江的桐江東岸。（完）</p>

<p>考慮錢莊要求減息</p>

<p>誰也知道、李校長之於我們、正如保姆之於嬰孩、嬰孩沒有保姆、旣然不能生存、則我們離開了李校長、亦將何堪設想、我們的李校長。盡其畢生之精力、圖謀復旦之發展、宵旺勤勞、三十年如一日、復旦今日有如此鞏固之基礎、過去有幾許光榮之史蹟、莫非李校長之心血所成這樣偉大的精神、以及高尙之人格、不但令我們全體敎職員與同學愛戴、卽社會人士、亦無不讚揚備至近來全體同學、受愛國心所驅使、整隊赴京請願、我們的李校長。旣不願坐視辛辛學子、荒廢學業、又不忍挫折愛國靑年救國之心、再者旣奉政府命令、促其設法勸阻、又　輿情慫恿、望渠善為領導、我門的李校長、雖苦口婆心、勸慰同學返校、而我們同學、因愛國心切、不得不遺校長之　旨、處此情境、李校長進退維谷、所以只得辭職委曲求全、然面我們的李校長、其中心之苦痛、不言而喻、誰願餐風嚼雪以療飢解渴、誰願跋踄長程、而露宿連宵、誰也知省靑年學子、　當埋頭苦幹、以備為國效勞、可是當茲漢奸遍地之時、胡騎馳騁我之疆土、日機又飛翔於我之領空、國家朝不保夕、我們處此境地、何　安心向學、誰也知道、靑年學生、是國家之主幹、為民族之命脈、我們為着責任的驅使、受着良心的苛責、只得投書搓筆、呼號奔走、不辭千辛萬苦、不顧飢寒交迫、祇求國家能够長存、民族能够復興、倘能達到目的、雖死不怨、我們祈望李校長立刻回校、主持校政、　希望李校長領率我們、共赴國難、我們高呼、擁護德高望重的李校長、擁護李校長領率我們共赴國難、親愛的李校長、憐恤我們吧快些回來、敬祝我們的李長健康、李校長萬歲、復旦大學萬歲、復旦大學全體同學敬啟、十一月廿六日、</p>

<h3>巿公安局　籌擴充職員宿舍　下月初旬可望成立</h3>

<h3>拒付房捐案　工部局補具理由書（續）二十四日</h3>
<p>被告謂「原告無權向被告收取捐稅，亦不得對被告提起訴訟，查原告之根據條約及恊定，得以合法的施行職權，旣如上述，而巿民之繳付巿捐，又為各國各地人民之所認為當然，而從未視之為新聞，為異蹟奇事者，被告住居於公共租界之內，享受租界居民之一切權利，權利之享受與義務之擔負，本屬相稅，而欲享受巿民之權利，遍天下將無被告立足之地，原告旣根據地皮章程第九條之規定，有權向被告收取捐稅，則同時對於該僅知權利而不負責任之被告，當然得向有管轄權之正式法院提起訴訟以補救之，　被告謂「原告不能明施表示其向意，僅劃為各國外僑居住之區惑而已，租界以內，本非華民居住之地，實則當時華民亦無居住在租界以內之必要一倣四五年最初之地皮章程第十五條第十六條曾有此種規定，後以一八五一年太平軍之起事，一八五三年小刀會之擾亂，使鉅量華民，因避難而徙居租界，故當租界開闢時住居界內之華民不及五百人，十年之內，增至五十萬人，已後革命也，內戰也，一九三〇年，竟逹九七一三九七人，因在一八五四，修改地皮章程之時，曾顧及此種華民徙居租界之新情勢，認為租界不容華民居住之原則，在事實上已有困難，但對於巿民應納捐稅之原則，當然應堅决的予以維持，此所以一八五五年二月二十四日蘇淞太兵備道藍蔚文所發准許華民居住租界之告示中，有「凡華民在界內———應遵照新定章程，按例納稅，」等語，所謂「遵照新定章程」者，即指一八五四年所修改之地皮章程也，所謂「按照納稅」者，即指遵照該章程之規定而納稅於租界當局也，原告向華人收取捐稅之來歷如此，此種歷史上之經過，被告昔奉英籍，或目不屑注意及之，殆以現今初復華籍之故，因而視之為創聞為奇事乎，　被告謂「納稅人之有選舉權，及明曉捐稅之收取與支付，為世所公認，」查工部局對於捐稅之如何收取，如何支付，月有月報，年有年報，專册俱在，而本埠中西各大報，亦且載之詳盡，不遺分釐，即對於被告所拒什之巿捐二百三十九元四角，亦不敢放棄，使其餘納稅人加其担負，故非特已，向法院起訴，求得一如何收取之道，並亦已預定該欵，在收得後之如何支付矣，至於納稅人之有選舉權，更為當然之理論，否則原告現今所有之五華董各華委，果何自而來耶，原告敢重言以申明之曰，凡公共租界內之納稅華人與納稅西人，實享有同樣之選舉權，及其他巿民應享之各種權利，毫無高下鉅細之別，被告或以初復華籍之故，不明吾租界華民應享之權利，因而認吾華民之得有選舉權，為不可信之創聞，為不可得之奇遇，遂致抹殺事實，置由吾納稅華人所依法選舉之華董華委於不顧，而慬作一宜傅之式之口號，曰吾納稅華人之選舉權，乃橫遭西人剝奪殆盡矣，為被告計，當先如數繳付，其應納之巿政總捐，然後取得納稅人之資格，則非特華人納稅會中有被告之一席，得坐享其應有，而並未受人，能言人所不能言，即被舉為華董華委，造福吾全體巿民，自為意中事也，　被告謂「不付房捐理由，為納稅大會年會上不能列得選舉權，而西人之同等納稅者，反得出席選舉，」查納稅華人之有納稅華人會，及由該會選舉而產生之五華董及華委，在工部局與英美日各國董事共同行使職權，旣為不可湮滅之事實，以歷史言，則最初之公共租界，實僅為各國僑民而設，並非為本國人民爭權論理之地，後經幾許轉折，幾許努力，吾納稅華人亦得在董事會上爭得五席，席數與英國同，較美日兩國，且各多三席，前人奪門之結果，使後人坐享其成，彼納稅西人之得在年會出席者，本為伊等固有之權利，而同時為吾納稅華人在事實上尚未取得之地位，但所以必須納稅者，則為吾人現今旣有居住在租界內之事實，而尚無因不願付捐而遷出租界之大志，以前復有兵備道藍蔚文之告示，以華人之照章納稅，為居住租界之必要條件，董事會上旣有吾華人之五席，而一切納稅西人所享有之巿民權利」除年會出席外，納稅華人，又共有之，至於條約本身，本為特殊情勢下之產物，屬政治，屬外交，而不屬於司法範　圍，其不能盡如人意之處，愛國志士可取之為演說之資料，以動人聽聞，而法官律師，則不能據之為辯論或判决之理由，因之面更改事實，遂特別給予被告以出席年會之權，　被告謂「原告之歧視態度太欠公平」不願付捐，查所謂歧視態度不知何指，大槪指上述之第五點而言，果爾，則蹈重覆之嫌，被告有歷舉十大理由之志願，而事實上發生搜索十大理由之困難，故不得不將同一理由，重覆作數種理山言之，以合整數，其行雖愚，其志堪嘉，但原告認為在上文已盡量解釋清楚，可以不必重行廢辭，作無謂之討論矣，　被告謂「工部局根據何項法律，只准西人投票選舉，而摒去華人享受同樣權利，」查被告昔附英籍，當知其昔日曾經投票選舉之根據，今初復華籍，或且不明租界內有納稅華人會之建立，及納稅華人，現今亦有投票選舉華董及華委之事實，原告以為此第七項理由，又與上述之第四項理由同，均屬與事實不相符之憑空宜傅，　被告謂「前清政府，並未授與上海公共租向華人收取捐稅之權利，」查此點，上述之第二項理由，又屬相同，吾人姑置一八五五年二月二十四日藍道台之告示於不問，再置當時華人遷移租界時自願納稅居住之歷史於不院內成千累萬已經確定之判决例之，工部局自得向被告徵收巿捐無疑也，　被告謂「房捐百分之十四，實屬太高，於法不合，亦未得被告之同意，」查被告之最初主張，為工部局無權向彼收取捐稅，及後又主張房捐百分之十四為太高，被告究以不當付巿捐之故而拒絕繳付，抑或因稅率百分之十四為太高，而不願繳付，忽龍忽蛇亦虎亦犬，前後主張，旣不一致，令人生不可捉摸之感，若果以百分之十四為太高，則試問其所以太高之理由，與如何可以减低之途徑，及應定百分之幾，方稱合法，方能取得被告之同意，更試問華界之各項捐稅，其定則幾曾得被告之同意乎，其徵收之方法，幾曾經過司法機關之手續乎，　被告謖謂「如能得到選舉權，亦願繳付公平合理之捐稅，」查納稅華人之有選舉權，早已為前人以外交及政治方式獲得，而不必被告在法院內再行努力，以色此已得而已經享有八九年之權利，考被告所謂之「選舉權，」大約與「出席年會」混為一事，查選舉權與出席年會，實為兩事，各不相涉，納稅華人已有選舉權，而尚不能「出席年會，」此種情形，即工部局本身亦不能絲毫改變之，被告應具狀國民政府，由外交部向各條約國提出以謀得一公平合理之辦法，否則向法院談外交，論政治，被告根據條約法律慣例事實，對被告應有徵收巿政總捐之權，而被告之拒絕繳付該項稅，實為毫無理由，應請鈞院判令如數支付，并負擔訟費實為德便，此呈上海第一特區地方法院，二十四年十二月十六日，具狀人上海工部局，訴訟代理律師汝葆彝，</p>

茶國，歷年茶之生產量對列如後：　　中國茶輸出額與世界產茶國茶生產額對照表　　（材料根據：中國銀行經濟研究室調查）　　觀上表，立可明瞭在華茶輸出之同時，即各國茶生產，急激增加之時。例如：在一八八六年，（淸光緒十二年）華茶輸出達二百二十一萬七千二百九十五擔，出現自對外發生貿易關係以來最高之紀錄。如以一八六八年爲基準而爲指數計之，則爲一四三·八九。但自一八八六年以後，華茶之輸出一路低减，至一九一七年，僅達一百十二萬五千五百三十五擔，表現於指數上僅爲七三·〇四，比之一八八六年全盛時期之輸出總數僅及其半。至一九一八年，復落至四十萬〇四千二百五十七担，表現於指數上僅爲二六·二三。然在此日期，印度在一八八六年之茶產量僅八千二百四十五萬三千磅，至一九一八年激增至三億八千三百九十七萬四千磅，在三十一年來激增達三六五％八之巨。即的增四倍。爪哇在同期間亦由七百四十五萬八千磅激增至七千〇八十九萬一千磅，至一九一九年竟增至二億二千二百六十萬磅，在三十二年間激增達二七八四％七叫即約增三十倍之巨。錫蘭在一八八七年茶生產量僅一千三百八十萬磅，至一九一九年激增至二億一千〇四十八萬七千磅。在三十餘年間激增一四二五％二即約增十五倍之巨。最近特別應注意者爲爪哇茶之生產，在一九一八年尙不過爲七千萬磅，至一九三三年竟激增至二億　千七百萬磅。在此時期錫蘭與印度均無甚增加，而爪哇之增加率特別强大，在此十五年間，激增達三六七％六即的四倍之巨。更需注意者爲蘇俄茶生產，蘇俄原爲世界茶之最大消費市塲，特別爲中國茶之輸出對象。但在一九三三年彼自國己能生產茶一百六十六萬磅，比之一九二八年增激三倍。故中國茶之對俄輸出亦爲减少。（未完）　　三，華茶市塲被侵奪之現勢　　中國茶之市塲首爲蘇聯，次爲英國，再次爲美國，最後爲印度，土耳其，波斯，埃及，日本及南菲洲等。此係依據一九三四年華茶輸出數量國別所定。茲將其統計數字列表如後：　　一九三四年華茶輸出數量國別之統計表（單位担）　　（未完）</p>

<p>申報文藝週刋在海輪上  江京　　應了友人的邀約，我踏上了開往南國的海輪。　　船是招商局的。我買的是房艙。大約一方丈大小的房間里，裝架着六個舖位。我上船時，已經有四位客人安頓好了。一跨進房門，就聞到一股香烟和輪船上那種特有的羶味混合着的氣息。自己是吸香烟的人，單是烟味到滿不在乎，可是那羶味却使人受不住。　　我盡可能地壓住我的呼吸，眼看着茶房把被蓋鋪陳好了，就急忙辦到船舷上去。　　黃浦灘的大建築，很淸晰地豎立在我眼前。我意識到我馬上要離開上海了。上海是非常惹我留戀的地方，在這里，有我的好朋友們在掙扎着。自己這次到南方去，雖然也許暫時能够過着短期的安定生活，但究竟覺得是「也許」當我想到這些時，不安和孤寂的感觸，緊緊地黏貼在我的心頸。我茫然地默數着面前的建築，那是法國領使館，那是天文台，那是匯豐，那是中國……。　　不久，船開了。有着心事的人，是很容易感到厭倦的。我懶懶地踱進那房間。那四位客人，有的在看小說，有的在吸香烟，有的在望着窗口出神。他們僅僅瞥了我一眼。我爬上我的床舖。在提箱內拿出預備給船上看的書。可是，把身子躺好了，却無論怎樣也看不下去。我只索性不看，把它拋在頭邊，一任我的腦筋去胡想。這時，我的感覺似乎特別靈活，會從房里的一種小物件，一步一步聯想到許多別的事情。但有時却也非常遲鈍，那種受不了的羶味，竟一點都不覺得。就是自已置身在什麽地方，也不曾　識到。　　船，不曉得在什麽時候駛出了長江口，黃色的水，已經看不見了。上面是秋季的明朗的天空，下面是一望無邊的碧水。在別人，也許可以從這種自然中，得到多少安慰，但我是素來不歡喜水這東西的。對於許多人讃嘆着的海，我極力排斥那種素來的成見，很留心地注視它，試想從它身上找出幾點可以讚美的地方，但結果是徒勞。如果這不能怪我所見的海中沒有雄峻的高山，大概是只能怪我自己的心靈有着缺陷。對於海旣然失望，我不得不把自已禁閉在那間小房里。昏昏沉沉地睡着，醒了後又是昏昏沉沉。　　是開船後的第二天，我的旅伴們忽然交談起來了。這使房里沉悶的空氣活潑起來。太久的沉默，不是人們禁受得住的。最先開口的是一位劉先生，一聽他的口音，就曉得他是上海人，胖胖的臉孔，黃中帶黑。穿着花緞棉袍，樣子是一個頗老練然而地位不高的商人。起初是遞香烟，接着是問各人的姓名，家鄉，到那里去，去幹什麽之類。這雖然是普通的應酬話，然而問得這樣淸楚，却使我感到煩厭。　　然而煩厭還不止此。經過了這塲應酬後，彼此間的交接，自然隨着多起來。遞香酒是頂平常的了，遞水果，借小說，都可以隨便接受。看起來，像煞不是新交而是老朋友似的。　　明天，船要到汕頭了。內中有兩位客人要在這里上岸。他們是在上海讀書的大學生。是回故鄉去的。他們都穿着洋服，但却沒有一般廣東學生的活潑，和人談話時，顯出世故很熟的和藹的笑容。從他們的舉動，我推測他們的家庭，不是中等的地主，便是老底子的頗爲富有的商家。　　就在這天晚上，那位劉先生忙碌起來了。他在自己提箱內尋出毛筆，信紙，向茶房要了硯台，就把那小提箱擺在錦上當做桌子，在那里用心地寫起來。大家都以爲他在寫信了。然而不然。約莫過了半點鐘的光景，他一手拿着筆，一手拿着一張八行信紙，送給我們看了。紙上開頭寫着「蓋開……」之類的生硬文章，無非是「萍水相逢」，「後會難再」，要留一個紀念的意思。接着就是畫好了的空格，像一般履歷表似的開列着姓名，籍貫，職業，和通信處。他已經把自己的姓名等項填在最末的一格了。　　他把他的意思向大家申述一番之後，首先把那張紙頭送到一個五十多歲的商人面前。大槪是算敬他年紀大的綠故。他還是　的同鄉，有着一副瘦削勤謹的面孔。是做紙生意的。他睡的鋪位，在我的下面，他依樣寫好以後，劉先生就順便送給我。　　我對於這種過甚的親熱，不但覺得煩厭，而且使我小心警戒起來。我懷疑他不是一個正當的商人。雖然我曾想起我們家鄕有「同船共波，三十六修」的話，原諒他也許是過信這同樣的俗見，但隨即被「他是吸鴉片的」這一事實打消了。我想起初出門時長輩叮囑我的一些江湖上應該　防的事件，不要和生人接近，避免一切過甚的親熱，就是其中最主要的一條。因爲吃江湖飯的人，多是用這種手段騙取客人的財物的。我也想起江湖上許多血淋淋的故事，如謀財害命，把尸首分成斷片，藏在箱子里，甚至連「七劍十三俠」裹面一枝梅用的化骨丹都想到了。自己雖然自信沒有財給人謀，或許他也不至像那樣狠毒，人心隔肚皮，究竟是難測的。然而我却沒有拒絕他。一方面固然是推想也許不致有別事故，一方面也明白斷然的拒絕，在對方是很難爲情的，如果他眞是一個壞人，說不定竟因此反激起他的惡意也未可知。不過，我的警戒之心，却沒有解除，我把我的名字改了，在通信處那一格裹，隨便塡了一個假的上去。　　大家都塡好了。他似乎很高興。於是，他又伏在小提箱上忙碌起。約莫又費了半點鐘的工夫，他把那張草稿重新謄過了，而且一共謄了五張。於是，他笑嬉嬉地分送給我們。　　紙上的字句依然和先前一樣，字體却是一筆不苟的正楷。最惹我注目的是顆鮮紅的印記　　「他正經地蓋了圖章了！」　　顯然地，這顆鮮紅的印記大大地給了我一種嘲笑。我眞正覺到慚愧了。我的不正當的疑念，完全被它溶化了。我是多麽卑鄙，多麽渺小呵！　　「我怎麽會在人與人之間樹起這種隔膜來的呢？」「賊墟」風光  子模　　　像隆福寺廟會，前門夜市那樣的帶有歷史性的墟集，在這個大商業城市是看不到的，但，在這一方面，這裹也有牠的特殊的殘存物，那就是橫墟。　　「賊圩」和「五更圩」是橫墟的別名，驟聽到這兩個怪名字，已可以猜到這個圩集跟尋常的不同，多少帶有點神秘性。　　試想像一下，偷兒靠着妙手，黑夜裹跳牆撬洞，偷得一些東西，趁着天還未亮，帶着忐忑的心，溜到這兒來，鬼鬼崇祟的急求出脫，是怎樣的光景　　還有破落的舊家子弟，禁不住病妻餓兒的呻吟啼哭，覷着家人還在夢中，暗把幾代祖傳的一件珍玩或一卷名畫揣在懷裹，跑到這個下流的窟穴，思思縮縮的來換取幾天的柴米錢，又是怎樣的光景？　　更想像一下，在灰暗欲曙的天空下，幌動的燈籠和熊熊的火把光中，幢幢的人影蠢動着，在打價的時候，用暗語手勢來問答，又怎樣饒有傳奇的意味？　　因爲墟裹的賣主是這樣畸形的人物，識貨的古董客，以至騷人雅士式的收藏家　像荷馬史事詩中的金羊毛找尋者那樣聞風而來，自然父發生不少動人的傳說與這個圩相聯綴。　　可是，自從法網嚴密起來以後，這個圩集早巳要在「光天化日」之下來舉行。「五更圩」旣成陳跡，「賊圩」這個名字也就跟着不大貼切。當我在初冬的淸晨冒着剛吹起的北風，第一次上那裏趕集的時候，想像和傳說果然不能在那裹證實了。　　那裏沒有甚麽珍寶古董，也沒有甚麽異樣的人物，那只是整理過後的垃圾堆，廢物的陳列塲，收買破爛的小販（也就是北京人所謂打鼓的」）的交易所。但是呵，窮人們一生需用的衣着器具已可在那兒發掘到了。　　從城西華林寺北去，數百的攤子在大街橫巷的地上擁塞着。攤子上擺的，堆的，大至殘廢的衣櫃，折腿的桌椅，小至一釘一鈎，煤烟般的舊棉絮，脫了毛的敝裘，鷄毛，玻璃碎，破甑銹釜，廢銅爛鐵，竹頭木屑應有盡有；前世紀式樣的女鞋，現代的斷了絲的電燈泡，沒有電的乾電池，用來包花生米的斷爛書報，在那兒也占一個重要的畸角；賣着油條油榨粽等下等零食的小販，和找換銅子的小攤在這等地方自然少不得的。　　擺攤的大半是上了年紀的人，一望過去盡是乾癟黃瘦多骨的臉孔，恍惚呌化子的隊伍，像肉舖掌櫃那樣的大胖子，在這裹　鑼也找不到的。他們擁着敗絮，或披着麻包蹲在晨風中縮瑟着。額頭架着用鐵綫改製成的藍眼鏡，穿着一件破馬褂的老頭，算全圩最出色的人物。　　顧客們眞可以說是一摩肩接踵」，比平常的圩集還熱鬧。他們的流品不見得比賣主高多少，不是行家，便是連尋常的故衣店或舊貨攤也上不了的飢餓綫下的窮人。他們背着舊包袱，挽着蒲包，灼灼的眼睛向兩旁搜索着。衣衫齊整的差不多是例外，偶然有的就是好奇的觀光者和想在那兒淘金的熟客。更有一兩個時裝的女人用小手絹掩着鼻在人叢中攢動。　　鷄毛，破毛，廢銅爛鐵一類的東西，照例是論斤買賣的舊書也是論斤，假如顧客是行家的話。光着脚鴉的「蛋家女」化了幾分錢買了一雙鹹魚似的緞鞋，裂着黃牙齒笑；兩個小學生掏出兩個銅子換得一個壞了的小電池，一路得意洋洋的回去。　　「你這塊棉被買了多少錢呀？」一個老頭兒看見前頭吊着一卷又破又黑的棉被絮的小姑娘，妒忌似的向她問道。　　「三毛錢，論斤買的，」小姑娘的語氣似乎有點驕人。　　「他媽的，你不要虎人，買不起就拉倒！甚麽是偷來的！」微妙的聲音自一個人叢中置着，跟着有一個穿中山裝的中年男子氣冲冲的排開衆人走出來。　　「一個鐘頭還沒有落市，他媽的，眞晦氣，」一個瞎了一隻眼睛的攤販自霄自語　，「那小子挑中這個鐵鍋，才還我五分錢，他是我小舅子，我還送給他呢！」　　怨駡，吵嘴和關於一兩個銅子的爭論造成那兒的市聲。　　從圩裹擠出來，我回頭一望，才發現擺攤子的大街上兩旁都蓋着新式的樓房，這個襯映也是怪令人尋味的吧！　　尋常舊貨攤子本來就是社會升沈，世態變移的活的紀錄閱盡人事滄桑，值得人低徊的。這個「賊圩」似乎更有深長的社會意味，那裏擺賣的舊物，無論是偷來的，抑或收買來的，總多少濺着窮人的血淚；到那裏趕集的，無論是攤販或顧客，一般總是被社會遺忘了的人。這個歷史的殘存物，眞個可以跟北京前門外的「鷄毛廠」，上海閘北的江北草棚，倫敦的貧民窟等大都市的奇蹟一樣的自豪呢！　　古戰塲巳有人弔了，這個纍纍滿堆着社會失敗者的遺物的今戰塲，讓我們來弔弔吧！零度下  大保　　大地上的河流也冰結了，　　草原上凝結起皂白的風霜。　　昨日的河水是盪漾的，　　——像生命在流轉。　　昨日的草原是靑色呀，　　——在誇示靑春的驕傲。　　天色也凝結了，　　東方沒有了彩霞！　　沒有了彩霞，　　像人間沒有了年靑的歡愉的詩。　　全世界靜穆的躺着，　　像僵尸！　　零度，零度下，……　　沒有熱情，沒有動靜，……　　讓高壓和沉默在世界上制霸……　　（一九三五年冬）風土畫  蘆焚　　　—大行追記—　　一個人跑到老遠的深山裏，大抵總想「稀奇」一下，然而掃興得很，還不曾「稀奇」到『稀奇』的地步，還不曾看見白光一道，或飄飄然的五彩祥雲，許是仙緣未至罷，還得等一等的。　　於是就等了。　　有這麽一天，我在山崖上等着。望望流雲，看看遠山近谷，覺得飄飄然，非常淸高了。但這飄飄然並未嘗做什麽苦修的功夫，也不會拿雲霞來充饑，只不過爬了幾個小山頭罷了，身體疲乏，也是自然的，且出了些許的汗，太陽和煦的照着，經微風一吹，這福分可說已竟不淺。可是仍不　足，就又想開去了，關於仙俠………（那時我還不知道這些寶貝住在上海的大房子裏）！　　也就在這時，通着路的那座山嶺上有羊似的黑點出現，起先蠕動着，蠕動着，漸漸像走在沙漠上的駱駝了，是一個縱隊，一個商帮，將財產放在畜牲的背上，搖搖幌幌繞着彎子，降入谿谷裹去。　　這呌做「馱子」。　　在山裏，永遠看不見車輛，唯一的運輸方法就是用牲口駝，彷彿也是「自古」……就被周公封定了的。　　馱子在太陽未出之前，谿谷間還重鎖着霧，便荷起數百斤的重載上路，向山嶺昇上去，　　一連串的，像騎兵一樣。等到日將中午了，才翻過弟一架山頭。嵌着鐵的蹄脚，躂在渾圓的團石上或生稜的三尖石上，發出咶咶的聲音在空曠的山中響着，鈴鐸可咚，很有韵緻的和鳴。有時，聲驢呌，便四山回應。　　這些疲癩的傢伙，倘遇着陌生的雌性，也像都市裹的流氓看見鄕下大姑娘，是會發一發性的，那就不管三七二十一的來一手「武把子」，踢跳一陣，或者，直莽闖下去，將死挺挺的貨物摔掉。但發性的時候很少，因爲已竟精疲力盡，己竟沒有性慾了。可是這些無賴總不十分安分，牠們無緣無故的停下來，任你打，任你駡，只是給一個不理。非但此也，這班「趟子」上的畜牲，却留下餘裕冷眼望着那打駡者，一如說：「發火嗎……還怎樣呢？」這樣實行着甘地主義，一直等駝戶打足駡够，終於頭上冒着火，眼中充着淚，且再四的祈求過了，還是不走！駝戶認輸，無可奈何的將貨物搬下來，這塲抗戰才算結局。此時人負起那些纍贅的包袋，又要向畜牲的三代臭駡一番了。而牲口反置若罔聞，倒是自自在在走着　　馱子的縱隊一天川流不息的走着，荷着本地土產物，山西煤炭，汾陽酒，搖響起鈴鐸，撒下便溺的泊跡。駝戶大抵是一些有了年紀的人，頭戴大毡笠，也有年靑漢子，頭上却裏着白頭巾，這原來是此地的時裝。手裹不停的抽着響鞭。口角　着旱烟管，吱吱叫着，生烟草的香氣與裊裊靑色的烟路上飄揚着，在山巒間，在荒谷裏。大槪總是默默的走着，　　一直夜間落了脚，向店家要一盆豐盛的水來，將從家中帶來的泥垢一下子洗掉。吸吸旱烟管，摔摔鞋，從鞋縫裹尋出一個小砂石子來。靑閒話幾句，打一個欠呵，睡罷。　　貨一到「地頭」，碰運氣找着了吝嗇得出色的主顧，那怕是再小的城市，也要去逛，逛了。於是想起了老婆要二尺鞋面子，女兒又要印花直真呢棉褲，孩子又要一隻小鼓。躭擱那麽一兩天，又忽忽忙忙的返回來了。馱子的鈴鐸仍極有韻緻的響着，然而駝的東西已不如先前的重，而是將婦女裝點起來，將房子照亮的洋貨了。烟斗裹依舊吱吱的呌着，冒出靑色的烟，可是這次是大錢三百文一兩的烟絲，連味道也都變了的。　　倘夜深尚未趕上宿店，就只好在山上過夜。最近的詩論與詩話  伯韓　　（讀報雜記）　　我一向有個不高興讀新詩的傾向。我常常覺得新詩的大部分是不好懂又不好歌唱的。與其讀新詩不如讀民間謠曲的有趣味。　　近來看見時事新報「靑光」上的幾篇詩論，和立報「言林」上的幾篇詩話，知道當今的「詩界」正在企圖替新詩打開一條出路，不單是想做大衆所需要的詩，而且要做那種大衆能懂，不僅能懂，而且是可以拿來歌唱的詩。　　我覺得這種趨勢，是詩的讀者們的福音。　　後來在大公報上又看到上官碧一新詩的舊帳「，在申報文藝週刊」看到任鈞「論詩的出路」，在時事新報「每週文學」上又看到郭沫若淑明諸人討論詩的文章。我知道目前詩　上有幾個爭論的問題，頗值得注意。　　第一是形式上的雅和俗的爭論。主張雅的可以把上官碧來代表。他以爲詩的文字頂要經濟，旣然要經濟，就不能不注意形式的雕琢和詞藻的運用。他以爲過去自由詩的運動是失敗了，後來經過徐志摩聞一多諸人的努力，把形式優美的新詩建設起來，新詩的標準才提高了。讀者雖然因此减少，但詩人們不應當爲遷就　者而降低詩的標準。　　主張俗的可以拿陳子展來代表。他在「蘧廬詩話」各篇里面，很注重了形式方面的批評，極力反對那些專門堆砌詞藻及意思隱晦的新詩，另方面却贊成「不雅的詩。」　　關於這個問題，我們要指出雅的一派，是由於某種階層的高貴生活而决定的，因爲「飽食終日，無所用心，」不能不拿幾句內容貧乏的詩去雕琢雕琢，橫豎不是給大衆讀的，自然不妨做得難懂一些。「蘧廬詩話」的批評是很具體的，比一般論詩的文字通俗而有效力。不過有點偏於形式方面。　　第二是形式上的可不可以採用舊詩詞變體的論爭。主張相當的採用從舊詩詞蛻化出來的胡適之體」者有陳子展，反對「胡適之體」的有任鈞。　　陳子展所謂「胡適之體」的代表作，是一首飛　　行小鑽」那詩是：　　看盡柳州山，　　看遍桂林山水。　　天上不須半日，　　地上九千里。　　古人辛苦學神仙，　　要守百千戒。　　我今不修不煉，　　也凌雲無碍。　　任鈞說胡適之在嘗試集序上自己承認他的詩體是纏過小脚再放脚的體裁，是對的；不過這一首飛行小讚，比起嘗試集裹面的如夢令之類，的確又進步了一點兒，他倒底沒有死板板的去塡什麽調調兒。只是詞句上，像末尾幾行，似乎稍微太「文」了一點兒，不是眞正的口頭語。　　我以爲，單就形式上講，從舊詩詞蛻化出來的詩體，未必完全不可用，不過要注意這幾點：　　第一，要的確是從舊詩詞的格律解放出來了，而且用現實的語言去充實着；　　第二，這只有對舊詩詞有素養的那部分人可用，不必向新詩人們作一般的介紹；　　第三，這只能作爲出發點，採用這種形式以後，隨着新內容的發展，還要隨時改變的。　　至於「胡適之體」本身的缺點，主要的還是在其內容的貧乏及意識的離開大衆吧。這一點好像陳任二君都沒有觸到，雖然任鈞在正面主張上曾說到新詩人要面對着現實及充實自己的生活。　　第三個爭論問題，是從形式內容並重和特別强調內容的當中發生起來的。　　本來，一般進步的新詩論者在原則上都承認了形式和內容的統一，及內容决定形式諸點的。但郭沫若氏爲針對當前的現實而特別强調着社會價值的重要性。他以爲只要意識正確，就是沒有什麽藝術價值，也未必要不得；因此主張標語口號也可以入詩。　　對於郭的主張提出反對意見的有淑明，他以爲詩雖然主要的是要有社會價值，但藝術價值也不可忽視，於是堅持用語形象化的原則。　　這個問題，給「每周文學編委會」巧妙地解决了。他舉出一個修詞很好的標語做例子，那是合乎用語形象化的條件的。這就是說，標語口號可以作爲詩的形式，但同時又是有條件的。　　除上面幾點以外，我覺得主張採用大衆歌唱的形式以及主張從利用民歌謠曲的形式出發，都是很可寶貴的意見。　　但是，我們不能希望那些躱在藝術之宮的人們來採用上述的形式。所以一面對着現實，充實着自己的生活」，這兩句話應當作　新詩人的座右銘，也就是新詩出路的基點。秋令樂  法Chateaubri　and著　嚴大椿譯　　我帶着無可形容的快活看那暴風雨的季候回來，天鵝和野鴿所經過的地方，聚集在池邊草地上和葡萄根　小溝裹的小烏，在傍晚棲到最高的橡樹上去。當夜向林間的十字路舉起一層靑灰色的氣，風底悲吟或悅耳的歌曲在枯萎的蘚苔裏微響，我就歸家，身中被共鳴占據着。田頭遇到一個農夫，我停住步，看這傢伙突出在他原該收刈的麥穗底暗影裹，手裹拿着犂刃翻地，熱辣辣的汗點混和在冰冷的秋雨裏。　　有這黃昏時分，我登了池邊的小舟，獨自在燈心草和白蓮底浮動的巨葉之間搖着。那裹，會集了許多燕子，預備離開我們的鄉土。牠們的鳴囀沒有一聲能够逃脫我底耳朶。太陽落下的當兒，牠們還在水上玩耍，追逐着那些昆蟲，忽然一同投到空中，好像是試試牠們底翅翼。繼而，降下水面，懸掛在蘆葦上；蘆葦受了牠們底重量。輕輕彎下身子，一片混雜的啁啾塡塞了蘆葦的沉靜。　　夜畢竟下降了，蘆葦搖着牠們底紡錘和利劍，在牠們中間的那隊身披羽衣的旅客，那些水鷗，那些鴛鴦，那些翠烏，那些鷸，全部緘口了。池水激着岸邊：秋季的大聲音從沼　　窗林裹透出。我把小船搖到水灘，回到古堡裏。</p>

邊的去處奔，像故鄉的洪濤濺起皚白的浪花向浩水樹無垠的水平上滾，滾向何處？她母子倆現在這凄凉冷寂的街簷上也正同流水一樣隨着運命的顚簸。　　隨卽從電燈的光界外，憔悴的暗空中，洒下絲絲的，片片的，似鵝毛，又似棉茸，成羣地墜落下來了，從浮光裹可鮮明她的身軀，可是一着地又不見她的跡痕。大都會的浮塵，可也幸福地在遊逛着這不夜的世界啊，有一粒指頭大，搖幌她的身軀穿過珠紅招牌邊撲到她身上來了，她立意要分辨出這是什麽，俯下頭檢點脚前的地上，僅留一絲熱意的後頸上忽然感到一陣麻，連忙移上右手一摸，只有一滴水沾在中指和食指間，她驚駭着；　　「雪啊！——」眼前很快地飄過一個不十分整齊的陰影，她左腿拐過睡在墙角裹七八歲的孩子，孩子像睡熟了。「賣小孩兒！——要小孩兒啊？」　　但她只看見那個一聲不響的背影了。　　風不知從何處來，又不知吹向何處去，只留下千萬把尖刀，漫天遍地的在橫掃着，刮削着，雪花一朶一撮地飛翔下來，尖刀更有力地顯示她的威猛。　　於是她不能不想起兩山環抱下三間瓦屋的家，雪夜的松柴爐火閃耀在老頭子三個人的臉上，臉上熱烘烘地全帶着笑意，連漏風的窗和壁洞也仔細塞住。現在呢，現在也許尚浸在悠悠的洪流中，老頭子，你埋在哪一堆泥沙角落里？來接我們去啊，你忍心讓我們在這世上活受罪嗎？　　「媽！媽！——冷啊？」兒子縱起身，傴僂着走向母親那里去，「媽，討到東西沒有？」兩手不住摸着肚皮。　　「連人也瞧不見啊！」　　攙着兒子的肩信步走着，一張張乳色的玻璃，一塊塊格花鐵欄，緩緩地從眼前移動，脚像石頭，感不到全身的重量，但要走快，從胯骨起便不很靈活地聽心靈的指揮，她是想找一個避風的弄堂角來渡過這凄冷的黑夜。　　竄來一個人，像給誰追急了似的跑着。　　「賣小孩兒！」母親喊着。　　孩子訓練有素似的不需母親的啟示便尾着他：「老爺，發財老爺，給一個子兒，做做好事。」　　那人縮着頸，籠着手，衣擺在雪風中搖曳着，像聽慣這聲音頭也不回的向岔道上竄跑了。　　孩子停住脚等母親一道。她們穿過亮滑的馬道，穿過陰森的巷口，來到一所半開門的燒餅店門前。孩子向內一張，油籃里尚有兩支枯硬油條，母親開始要求給她們一支，那油條立刻引得小孩子的飴涎騷動起來，他幾乎伸手去搶，但給抹圍腰的那傢火喝住了。他轉向母親瞧一眼，探定他有什麽辦法。母親轉了念頭，把僅有的兩個銅板拿出來，道：　　「少一個子兒可買給我吧。」「都像你，我們要喝西北風！」那傢火漲紅臉。　　帶着絕望，帶着孩子又去找找那可避這奇寒的弄堂，但在臨去時，小孩子還狠狠地給油條盯一眼。</p>

<p>把只賸一小塊的棉絮偷偷摸摸地在弄堂巡捕的木棚後鋪好了。從木棚的圓洞內只射出一條燈光，沒有人聲，大槪巡捕也睡着了。於是母子倆也倚抱着睡了。孩子在母親懷抱里沒節奏的抖，細聲喊肚子餓得痛，母親附他耳邊叮囑他　　「別嚷，回頭巡捕聽見了要趕我們出去的。乖乖一睡着肚子便不餓了。你好好的睡聽話些。」　　雖然沒有雪飄來，但問或竄來的風却比馬道上還要冷，孩子撲在母親身邊抖得更厲害，睡不穩，母親緊緊抱住他，自己身上的那件破棉袍，似乎給冰結了的。悵惘  仲子　　　在朔風凜冽的嚴寒季節裹，難得碰着這麽和暖的日子。太陽光把三海的冰溶解了一半，護城河畔的巨柏有着一羣小烏在跳躍，中央公園里蕭索凄凉的景象好像給那噢暖的陽光帶走了。一對對情侶，在那迴欄上輕輕踱着慢步。公理戰勝碑下出現一羣充滿靑春活力的學生，大地上好像已有着春的消息了，可是現在不仍是仲冬的嚴寒時節嗎？　　風，比較和平多了，城根的厚土被煤車軋過之後雖然起了一陣飛揚，但是長安大道上却再看不見那些蒙着薄紗的女人了。　　迎着那和暖的陽光，我放開了大步，從庽所走了出來，毫無目的地踏上那平滑的給柏油舖過的王府井大街，一陣號角的聲音從西交民巷那邊送進我的耳鼓，跟着，一隊步伐整齊的「友國」軍人四個排的從那短垣的大門走了出來。在那些面孔上，我發覺不少獰猙可怕的表情。像一個失掉了勇氣的人一樣，我垂着頭，不敢再向那雄糾糾的武士們再瞟一眼。然而憤怒之火在我的心坎里燃燒了起來，我緊捏着拳頭，好像準備一次肉搏似的。　　走完了那段東長安大道，我的脚步加重了起來，我匆忙地衝到宣武門的城根。　　喘着氣，我登上了這古城的城頭，故宮的玻璃瓦發出萬丈光芒，把我的眼睛射得有點微痛了，　　沿着城慢慢走着，一種悵惘的情緒，就會不期然的襲進自己心坎里。　　這時候，也許一架塗着太陽徽的飛機在我的頭上掠過，那軋軋的聲音，刺激着我的每個細胞，我的熱血在沸騰，我的血管像快要爆裂了。　　我慢條斯理的在城上踱着方步，正陽門巍峨的建築巳引不起我的羨慕了，矗立於北海的白塔，像神話里的惡魔一樣非常可怕，蟄伏於故宮後的媒山給我一個恐怖的啟示，那幕歷史上的慘劇也許會重演一次吧，　　城上長滿那些野生的植物，我的脚有時候被那堅軔的藤蔓絆着，我的手有時又會給那生着刺的植物刺了一下，我的感情十分惡劣，先前那種游興好像都消失凈盡了。　　我伸長了脖子，想呼吸一口北國的新鮮空氣，然而一陣腥臭的氣味刺進我的鼻子裹，原來城堞上有着一隻死鼠的屍體。　　把視綫向西展開去，曖曖白雲籠罩上的西山雖然不失牠本來的美麗，但是那種垂　的老態却引起我一種不常有的惡劣心情。　　這時東方的天上給一塊黑雲佔據去了，那雲變幻出許多可怕的景物，有長着獠牙的惡魔，有兇殘相的鬼怪，有地獄般的塲合，這也許是一個嚴重的暗示，也許是一個恐怖的朕兆吧，　　忽然地，那塊黑雲漸漸由東天那邊向這古城移動，繼着一陳暴風把城邊的厚土捲了起來，那種黃　滿天飛的景象使人十分納悶。　　黑雲把古城的上空完全佔去了，西山上的白雲已躱到口外去了，雪，鵝　般一片一片打到我的面上，我抖索着，把大衣的領頭翻了起來，皮鞋踏着那野生的植物，急忙地從朝陽門下了城，一種恨惘的情緒更緊凑了。過年  耶戈　　　剛趕過蜈蚣嶺，日頭巳經沉西了，在那高接雲霄的獅子峯上，僅露出了一縷金黃色的霞光。　　來跛　脚，在後面滿面　漲着，大聲的呼吆過來：「你們這樣忽忽忙忙的想趕去赴刑塲嗎？奶奶　的！」大家沒有理睬他，但是却都把脚步放緩了。三天來沒有　斷的趕着一天一百三十里的山道，也眞把我們快嘴的小跛子苦够了，但是不這麽樣又有什麽辦法呢？誰家沒有家人大少在伸長着頭看望？　　下了嶺，便是薛家集，這集近來也零落多了，短短的有三二十家店鋪的街上，雖　近了年冬，但路過的客商和載貨的驢隊却都比往年稀少。　　停在正興棧口，大家便都猶豫起來了：趕進城呢？還是在這兒歇夜？臭來跛着脚趕得氣喘淋淋的，從背後過來，紅着眼睛，大聲埋怨着道：「上刑塲嗎？奶奶X的！」卸下包袱便坐在地上傷心地沉默着。正興棧的老板，那個紅鼻子的中年人，偷偷的從棧房內的破窗口伸一伸頭，便滿面堆着笑出來，用着謎樣的蟲或口調說道：「人客進城去嗎？還有五十里路好走，現在日頭也沉了，又是年兜年尾頭，大冷的冰凍天，恐怕來不及哩，」大家默默的看了他一眼，又互相的看了看：於是便跟他進去了。　　卸了包袱包，有幾個同伴便拿了一隻大木桶到廚房里要溫水洗脚去，而我則帶着一隻舊麵粉袋到集上去糴米打肉。集里靜悄悄的，沉了太陽便什麽都失色似的，人們懶懶的把身子縮短着，面上罩滿灰色，流着鼻水，大踏步的奔跑，躱在垃圾堆上的脫毛狗，因爲寒冷，便不時昂起頭哀哀的叫號。　　有一家魚舖店這時便集攏着一堆人在那兒，一個穿麻布大衣的農民，紅着鼻子，看樣子似乎剛從城里回來的，在大聲嘶叫着，叔述他底歷險的故事：「……那幾個赤子大聲的喊了一聲，便都從兩旁的刺崗上撞將出來；於是那幾個客商都嚇得呆了，大家死般的屹立着不動，有幾個自以爲聰明了的，假裝沒有聽見想跨開步走，却吃迎面來的幾個，兜頭就是一陣臭打；然後都不聲不響的被用繩子拴着望洞里去了。……　　「你們想那時我是好險哩！好在我眼尖手快，遠遠地看見勢頭不好了便滾下坑溝去躱藏着。當他們都走完了，才偷偷的爬出來，搶開步一直跑回集來。聽說在城里這兩天也很不穩，三天前大家便接到土匪要攻城的烏單，所以這兩天官府也都在忙着調兵遣將，天天有大批大批的人給押上南敎塲去砍頭哩！……」聽的人知道再也沒有什麽新鮮的下文了，便都慢慢的散開。　　打好肉又　了五角子米，我便回棧來，一入門，便聽見在棧房里紅鼻子的老板，用乾啞的聲調在說着：「……年冬窮啊！租債哪個不要還？我們大家都想快快活活的過一過年，赤子人何曾不那樣想！……入了冬集便鬧了三次匪，陳四的那頭三百多斤的大公牛和兩個五六歲的兒子，就在那時綁去的，到了現在還沒消沒息哩！黃大鼻那個在山洞里山田上失掉的十六歲女兒聽說巳經給販到XX去當娼了，這個年頭，唉！……」　　老板憤憤的打了個呵欠，大家復又沉默下去，西北風偷偷的在屋脊上呼鳴着。……」　　註：赤子卽窮人，普通指爲土匪。播音節目國學　　馮明權古文觀止　　李樹德（九四〇）上午七時半至八時半講題　曲園奢在堂隨筆（　）　　紀文達公嘗言。「聊齋志異一書。才子之筆，非著書者之筆也」。先君子亦言。「蒲留仙。才人也。其所藻續。未脫唐宋人小說窠臼。若紀文　　閱微草堂五鍾。專爲勸懲起見。叙　　。說理透不層屑於描頭畫角。非留仙所及」。余　右台伷館筆記。以閱微為法。而不襲聊齋筆意。秉先君子之謂也，然聊齋藻績。不失為古豐。後之繼聊齋而作者現後艷而已。甚或庸惡不堪入　。猶自詡爲步武聊齊「何留仙之不幸也」留仙有文集，世罕知之。朱蘭坡前輩國　古文彙鈔。曾錄其文二篇。其用意異造　。均以織巧勝。猶之乎志異也。留仙之等字立惠。字東石。亦有文集，筆意頗肖其父云。歌唱　　明梅團　　華美（一〇六〇）下午三時三刻至四時半一片春雲（純美）戰地之花（莉玲）靑春姑娘（張素貞）滿目凄凉（純美）再會我愛（莉玲）現代之光（張素貞）　　漢音歌詠社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時至六時　　五族共和（前奏）從軍別愛（漢瑋）夜花園裹（漢瓊）神女（漢璇）西湖春曉（漢瑛）搖船歌（漢璐）　　以下播送　求歌曲　　交通（一三〇〇）下午六時至七時　　新夜來香（漢瑋）粉紅色的夢（漢瓊）小妹妹的心（漢璇）花開爲着你（漢瑛）（以下播送要求歌曲）　　上海（一一〇〇）下午七時半至八時一刻　　賣油條（漢瓊）新婚的甜蜜（漢瑋）咪咪貓（漢璇）雪花飛（漢瑛）　　（以下播送要求歌曲）　　上海歌劇社　　新新（七八〇）下午七時至八時　　因爲你太美（周璇）蝴蝶姑娘（全體）窮快活（周潔）休息五分鐘（徐健）愛情如玫瑰（徐健）特別快車（周潔）賣花詞（瑛瑛）薔薇處處開（周璇）　　李樹德堂（九四〇）下午九時至十時　　攀不倒（周璇）民族之光（全體）摩登戀愛（徐健）牆裹牆外（周潔）王女士的鷄（周潔）漂泊者（徐健）因爲你（瑛瑛）鴻雁相思（周璇）　　大上海社　　華美（一〇六〇）下午九時至十時　　丁香山（文仙）好時光（飛虹）賣花女（飛亞）路柳牆花（文仙）嫁給勇士吧（飛虹）月下女郎（飛亞）薔薇花底（文仙）彈詞　　夏荷生三笑　　敦本（八〇〇）下午七時至八時　　開篇「阿房宮」　　六國君臣各具心·不知聯合抗强秦·奴顏婢膝甘諂諛·終於逐漸被秦吞·四海河山歸統一·阿房宮殿構造精。蜿蜒長蛇三百里·矗立雲霄接天庭。五步一樓十步閣。直達咸陽若比鄰·二川溶溶流入內。長橋臥被往來頻·廊腰縵迥簷牙啄。金璧輝煌耀眼睛。複道仃來多曲折·南北東西分不淸·歌臺舞榭勾心角·皇子皇孫樂趣尋·朝歌夜絃聲鼎沸·粉自黛綠獻慇懃。妝鏡開如星光耀。綠雲繞繞曉梳鬢·棄擲脂水成膩壑。椒蘭香氣神爲淸。宮車過·如雷鳴·絡繹相聯不留停。一肌一態多妍麗·漫立遠侍枉多情·豈知道·三十六年空餘恨。未蒙君土雨露親·燕趙寶·齊楚精·韓魏宮中搜羅盡。棄　遷迤多不惜·千古奢華沒處尋·全不想·千萬人心多一樣·全不想·仁德化民服衆心·欲思萬代傳帝業。何故橫暴不愛民。以致於·戌卒陳涉一聲呌。各地粉紛起義兵。胡亥被弒子嬰屈·前後不滿四十春·重瞳楚子心何忍·巍巍殿閣成灰爐。秦固無暇哀及此。留待後人刻骨銘。前車可鑒實寒心。　　邢瑞亭　頭鳳惠靈（一三八〇）下午九時至十時　　開篇「玉蜻蜓」　　　眼沉吟君即臨·宛如初會在三春·古派黨人先　鼻。鼻是人生一土心·古云萬物</p>

<h3>Martial Law Implemented in the Capital: Gu Zhenglun Concurrently Appointed as Martial Law Commander; Central University Students' Demonstration Advised Against; Luo Jialun Issues Proclamation Urging Restraint</h3>
<p>Nanjing, [Special Dispatch, 26th] Martial law was announced in the capital city starting from the 26th. Notices from the Garrison Command regarding martial law were posted on all major thoroughfares. More police and military personnel were dispatched to patrol stations, wharves, and public spaces. Public order is good, and everything is normal.</p>
<p>Nanjing, [Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th] Martial law was implemented in the capital starting from the 26th, with Gu Zhenglun concurrently appointed as Martial Law Commander. The following measures were announced:</p>
<p>*   The power to suspend gatherings and associations or to ban newspapers, magazines, books, advertisements, slogans, etc., deemed harmful to public order.</p>
<p>*   The power to inspect postal correspondence and telegrams, and to detain or confiscate them if necessary.</p>
<p>*   The power to inspect domestic and international ships, vehicles, and aircraft, and to suspend their traffic if necessary, and to cut off major roads and air routes.</p>
<p>*   The power to inspect travelers deemed suspicious.</p>
<p>*   The power to inspect organizations considered suspicious, but without intentionally causing damage.</p>
<p>Nanjing, [Special Dispatch, 26th] Luo Jialun, the president of National Central University, convened a meeting of all students at 8:00 AM on the 26th, announcing the implementation of martial law in the capital and advising students not to go out and demonstrate. However, the students did not listen. Luo Jialun immediately issued a proclamation, stating: "Regarding the proclamation, the martial law decree issued by the government has been implemented starting today. During the period of martial law, this morning's student gathering in the auditorium was originally intended to announce the public order. However, students are using this opportunity to discuss issues. I reiterate this warning to clarify responsibilities. After this proclamation, there must be no more gatherings, demonstrations, or other such actions. You must strictly abide by discipline, embody the sincerity of teachers' love, and show genuine respect for the nation. This proclamation."</p>
<p>Nanjing, [Special Dispatch, 26th] Luo Jialun, the president of National Central University, issued a proclamation on the 26th, urging students to attend classes as usual. The original text read: "Regarding the proclamation, at 10:30 PM on the 25th of this month, I received an order from President Chiang, stating that due to the discovery of reactionary plots in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, the situation is serious. A martial law decree has been issued this evening. Anyone who violates the previous decree will be subject to military law, etc. I also received an order from the Ministry of Education regarding the aforementioned. Therefore, I hereby issue this proclamation to all students of the university, so that everyone is aware. In future actions, it is imperative to strictly abide by discipline. You must understand that there are proper ways to love the country. Do not act impulsively and make useless sacrifices. I hope you will attend classes as usual, and that all demonstrations, propaganda, and other actions should be stopped to avoid accidents. This university cares for all students as if they were family members. I hope you will understand this sentiment and not disobey this warning. This is very important."</p>
<p>Nanjing, [Special Dispatch, 26th] After the announcement of martial law in the capital, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs immediately dispatched all supervisors to various private middle schools in the city to convey to teachers the need to instruct students to maintain order and focus on their studies.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Forms School Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, [Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th] Guo Renyuan, the president of Zhejiang University, has resigned. The Ministry of Education has approved his leave of absence. School affairs will be temporarily handled by the Dean of the Agricultural College, Li Deyi, in conjunction with the heads of various departments, who will form a School Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>Hangzhou, [Special Dispatch, 26th] Because Zhejiang University President Guo Renyuan has telegraphed the Ministry of Education again to request his resignation, and there is a lack of leadership to handle school affairs, the professors held a meeting and decided to send a telegram to the Ministry of Education urging them to quickly and appropriately address the situation so that the school can return to normal as soon as possible. In addition to sending a telegram to the Ministry of Education requesting them to send someone to maintain school affairs, the Student Self-Government Association decided to submit a request to Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Huang Shaoxiong to appoint Secretary-General Huang Huabiao as an acting agent for the transition period.</p>
<h3>Jiaozuo Students Pass Through Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, [Special Dispatch, 26th] A group of 143 students from the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology in Henan, who were on their way to Beijing to petition, arrived in Xuzhou this morning by Longhai Railway. When Train No. 71 of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway stopped at the station, the students boarded it en masse. Xuzhou station personnel tried to dissuade them without success, so they stopped the train from departing and telegraphed the Railway Bureau to request instructions. Huang Jie sent Political Training Director Fang Jikuan; the Special Commissioner's Office sent Tian Suixiang; the County Government sent Li Xu; and the Education Bureau sent Liu Xuexuan, who successively tried to persuade the students to send representatives to Beijing while the rest temporarily stayed in Xuzhou to spread their message. After the representatives return to Xuzhou, they will all return west together.</p>
<h3>Nantong Students Blocked from Petitioning in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nantong, [Special Dispatch, 26th] More than 300 students from Nantong boarded the "Yamato Maru" on the 26th to petition in Beijing. Military and police personnel tried to dissuade them, and the ship was prevented from sailing.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Students Decide to Send Representatives to Beijing</h3>
<p>Hankou, [Special Dispatch, 26th] After the Wuhan students' patriotic movement came to a conclusion, it was decided to send representatives to Beijing to receive instructions. The executive committee of the patriotic association held a meeting on the 26th and made many important decisions. The Provincial Education Association issued a letter to the students, urging them to study and save the country. The Chamber of Commerce and the Postal Workers' Union all expressed sympathy for the students.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Telegraphed Wuxi Station, Urging Students to Refrain From Proceeding Westward</h3>
<p>Wuxi, [Special Dispatch, 26th] Gu Zhenglun, the Commander of the Beijing Gendarmerie, traveled by train from Beijing to near Gaoqiao, Wuxi. The students expressed their desire to retain the resigning presidents of various universities in Shanghai, such as Li Denghui. They also telegraphed President Chiang, stating that the petition was entirely out of patriotic motives and urging him to order the Railway Bureau not to dismantle the tracks and to repair them as soon as possible so that the petitioners could reach their destination. Yesterday, Wuxi Station received a telegram from the Ministry of Education: "To Inspector Sun and Inspector Hao of the Ministry of Education, who are en route, and to all students from Shanghai: We have received telegrams from Secretary Ma of this Ministry and others, and we understand your patriotic zeal and sincerity. We are deeply moved. The government has now established clear procedures to receive the opinions of the youth of the nation, explain the government's policy, and a meeting is approaching, where everything can be explained in detail. You do not need to insist on coming to Beijing at this time. Furthermore, a crowd of one or two thousand people is congesting the roads, obstructing traffic, and your hardship is a cause for concern.

<h3>Chen Juesheng Takes Over Beining Railway Bureau</h3>

<h3>Meeting of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee Canceled Yesterday; Internal Organization Largely Finalized</h3>
<p>Beiping, [Special Dispatch, 26th] The third regular meeting of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, originally scheduled for tomorrow, has been canceled because Chairman Song Zheyuan, Committee Members Qin Decun, Su Zhenying, Gao Lingyu, Li Tingyu, and Cheng Ke, and others are all in Tianjin.

<h3>Tianjin-Pukou Security Department Files Received by Garrison Department</h3>
<p>Date of Song's Inauguration in Baoding Undecided; Two Cavalry Companies Open Tianjin-Beiping Line</p>
<p>Beiping, [Special Dispatch from Tianjin] After the Tianjin-Pukou Security Command was dissolved, it requested the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison Department to take over. Song Zheyuan sent Chief of Staff Liu Jialuan to the department this morning to receive various important files. All subsequent matters will be handled by the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison Department.</p>
<p>Tianjin, [Special Dispatch, 26th] Song Zheyuan said that he plans to stay in Tianjin for two or three days and return to Beiping before the New Year. He will review the troops at the West Garden on New Year's Day and will entertain the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Beiping on the 4th. The date of his inauguration in Baoding has not been decided. Since he has sent someone to complete the takeover, there is nothing to do there and there is no need to go there urgently. The most important task in Hebei Province at present is to eliminate banditry. Recently, due to the movement of troops, the defense areas are empty, and bandits have risen, such as in Gu'an, Renqiu, Xian County, and Cang County, where bandits are harassing the area. If they are not quickly suppressed, the harm will be great. It has been decided to send the 29th Army to be responsible for patrolling to pacify the local area. When the Military Branch was not withdrawn, there were many troops stationed in Hebei Province, responsible for different sections. Now that most of the troops have been transferred elsewhere, if we only rely on the 29th Army to bear the national and provincial defenses, from Chahar East to Hebei South, the defense line is so vast that it can be勉力maintained during peacetime, but if an accident occurs, it is felt that the troop strength is weak. The Tianjin-Pukou Security Command has ordered the Chief of Staff of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison Command, Liu Jialuan, to receive the pending cases, approximately sixty cases, which are temporarily closed and will be sent to the Tianjin office of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters for a retrial after it is established, to avoid the cumbersome back and forth sending important cases to Peiping.</p>
<p>Beiping, [Special Dispatch, 26th] Two companies of officers and soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Regiment of the 29th Army, led by Deputy Regiment Commander Liu Yuheng, arrived in Beiping from Zhangjiakou this afternoon and immediately transferred to the Tianjin-Beiping line for garrison duty.</p>
<h3>Tianjin-Pukou Railway Passenger Train Carelessly Catches Fire, Occurring Again at Cao Lao Ji Station</h3>

The cause of the fire is unknown, and the railway is investigating. Up and down trains were delayed again this morning.</p>

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>Tension in Japanese-Russian Relations and Their Impact</h3>
<p>— Record</p>
<p>Since the breakdown of the so-called Japanese-"Manchukuo"-Mongolian negotiations in July and August of this year, Japanese-Russian relations have been clouded with an ominous atmosphere. The hostility of the Japanese Kwantung Army towards Russia has further escalated the relationship from a state of latent instability to open conflict. In late September of this year, the Japanese Commander in Tianjin, Tada, published a booklet advocating anti-Russian sentiment. On November 18th, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota proposed the principle of establishing a "Sino-Japanese Joint Anti-Communist Front." Consequently, the attitude of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the military towards the Russian issue has become completely consistent, and Japan's military threats against Soviet Russia have intensified.</p>
<p>According to a TASS news agency dispatch from the Soviet Union, on the 19th of this month, Japanese-Manchukuo forces armed themselves, plundered the Mongolian border, and killed and captured as many as sixteen Mongolian border guards. The Outer Mongolian authorities have lodged a protest with the puppet regime. Meanwhile, according to Reuters, the counties of Gucheng, Baochang, Kangbao, etc. in Chahar Province have recently been completely occupied by "Manchukuo forces" or pro-"Manchukuo" Mongolian troops. As of the 22nd, Zhangbei, an important town in Chahar Province, had also been occupied by Mongolian troops from Hailar. Although rumors of unrest in Inner Mongolia have not been confirmed, the attempt by the puppet army of Li Shouxin to move towards Inner Mongolia to cut off its connection with Chahar Province, and the fact that some party is dispatching many military officers to Bailingmiao to operate, have become undeniable facts. The purpose of this active westward and northward policy of the Japanese-Manchukuo forces is to create a vast anti-Soviet front in "Manchukuo," Mongolia, and North China, which is clearly evident.</p>
<p>As a result of this situation, anti-Japanese sentiment in the Soviet Union has also surged. On the 23rd of this month, citizens of Boli (Khabarovsk) in Siberia, Soviet Union, threw stones at the Japanese Consulate in Boli. Simultaneously, on the 24th, Soviet government leaders met with officers of the Pacific Fleet to inquire in detail about the fleet's condition and military-political training. This military confrontation seems to clearly tell the world that if Japan continues its aggressive advance, the outbreak of Japanese-Russian war will become an unavoidable reality.</p>
<p>Based on the tension in Japanese-Russian relations, the Japanese control over North China will inevitably become more active. Occupying the six eastern counties of Chahar Province is aimed at severing transportation between China and Russia. The purpose of the puppet troops in the Eastern Hebei war zone advancing and occupying Tanggu is to facilitate Japanese military transportation. The purpose of establishing the "North China Anti-Communist Association" is to obtain security for the rear. All of this is a deliberate act by the Japanese army against Russia, and it is a matter of life and death for our Chinese nation. Shouldn't the people of our country pay close attention to it?</p>

<h3>US Congressman Proposes Abolishing the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Believing It Actually Endangers Peace</h3>
<p>Washington: Republican Congressman Tinkham declared today that as soon as Congress opens in January of next year, he will propose to abolish the Kellogg-Briand Pact, because Tinkham believes that "the result of the United States supporting the League of Nations is war rather than peace." Tinkham also stated that after the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact, world powers began to increase their armaments, and then the Great Depression and the Italo-Ethiopian conflict followed. Now the British-Italian crisis has truly endangered world peace. All countries in the world, except Bolivia, have signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but it has still failed to prevent war. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: Congressman Tinkham, a Republican congressman from the Massachusetts constituency, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently declared that when Congress reconvenes in January next year, he will propose a bill advocating that the country should withdraw from the 1928 Paris Peace Pact, saying that "this pact is no longer a peace pact for maintaining peace, but instead a convention for causing war, not only confusing in meaning and disappointing, but also contradictory to reason and normal concepts." For example, in the case of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, if the United States implements the Non-Aggression Pact, the result would be to undermine the United States' neutrality policy and create a threat of war.

<h3>Tragic Train Crash in Berlin; Death Toll Confirmed at 30; Over 70 Injured, Some Seriously</h3>
<p>Berlin: After the Berlin express train and a local train collided near Gross Kreutz on the second day, the number of dead and injured has been checked. It is now known that 30 people died, 22 were seriously injured, and 50 were slightly injured. The collision site was on a bridge over the Saale River. The previous report that the local train had stopped outside the station is now confirmed to be incorrect. When the collision occurred, the two trains were actually running towards each other. A part of the local train had entered another track, and unexpectedly, the express train sped in and crashed a passenger car of the local train into the river, while another car fell off the track. The remaining six cars were mistakenly destroyed. It is said that the driver of the second locomotive of the express train did see an obstacle ahead, but could not stop the train in time to avoid the collision. Soldiers are currently searching the Saale River for the bodies of those who fell into the water. (Reuters Dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Disputes Arise in Manchuria and Mongolia; Japanese-Russian Situation Becomes More Serious; Similar to the Strategy of Competing for Korea Forty Years Ago; US Observation: No Direct Conflict</h3>
<p>Washington: Regarding the recent protest by the Outer Mongolian government to "Manchukuo," senior officials here today believe that this dispute between Japan and Russia is quite similar to the strategy used by the two countries to compete for Korea forty years ago. According to experts, border conflicts and diplomatic tensions are actually actions by the two countries to compete for control of East Asia and encircle each other. They believe that a direct conflict is unlikely to occur immediately, but if the Italian-Ethiopian dispute spreads to Europe, then a direct conflict may be possible. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>Dalian: Two more conflicts have occurred on the border between Manchuria and Outer Mongolia, making the situation more serious. One incident occurred at 11 a.m. on December 24th. It is reported that three Japanese soldiers died and one Manchukuo soldier died. The other incident occurred at 1:30 p.m. on the same day. According to news received in Dalian, the Japanese and Manchukuo forces in the border area are in a state of panic because the Outer Mongolian troops have repeatedly invaded and deliberately provoked incidents. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, "Manchukuo" plans to establish 13 new defense posts in the border area. The wording of the official documents exchanged by both sides is very strong, so the relationship between the two sides has made no progress. On December 21, the "Manchukuo Foreign Ministry received a letter from the Outer Mongolian government blaming the conflict two days ago on the Japanese and Manchukuo troops, demanding the return of the wounded soldiers captured by the Japanese and Manchukuo troops, and guaranteeing that similar incidents would not occur again in the future. The Manchukuo Foreign Ministry replied yesterday, rejecting the demand and stating that the conflict on December 19 occurred in "Manchukuo" territory, so Outer Mongolia should bear full responsibility. When Outer Mongolia continues to refuse to establish friendly relations with "Manchukuo," Manchukuo will punish the invaders." This refers to Outer Mongolia's refusal to exchange diplomatic representatives with "Manchukuo." (Reuters Dispatch on the 26th) Leningrad: Kenden, Chairman of the State Council of the Mongolian Republic, Land Minister Demit, and Kenden's entourage have arrived here. The liaison officer stationed in Leningrad by the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Leningrad Soviet, and the Commander of the Leningrad Military District all went to the station to welcome them.

<h3>Under the Control of the Kwantung Army: Over Ten Thousand Puppet State Japanese Officials, Salaries Three Times Those of Domestic Officials, Power of Appointment and Dismissal Held by the Southern Commander</h3>
<p>Changchun: The number of Japanese officials in the puppet Manchuguo now reaches over 15,000. Their salaries are actually three times those of officials in Japan proper. These leisurely officials, along with their families, come to "Manchuria" and live luxuriously, a rare sight in Japan. As for the power of appointment and dismissal, it is not held by Nagaoka Ryuichiro, the Director-General of the General Affairs Agency of the puppet State Council, nor by General Ono Ryokichiro, the commander of the Kwantung Army, but is entirely controlled by the commander of the Kwantung Army. Therefore, the Southern Commander is the de facto emperor of the puppet Manchuguo. As for the organization of the Kwantung Army Headquarters, it is extremely secret.</p>
<p>First Section - Military Operations Department - Preparations for war against the Soviet Union and China are secretly planned and researched by the First Section. Internal security is extremely tight, and it is very difficult for outsiders to approach. Colonel Shimomura is the section chief, with five staff officers under him (names kept secret).</p>
<p>Second Section - Intelligence and Propaganda Department - Colonel Kawabe is the section chief, with three branches under him: (1) Soviet Intelligence Branch, (2) Chinese Intelligence Branch, (3) News and Communications Branch. Third Section - Manchurian Political and Economic Department - This includes the Special Service Department, which was reorganized earlier. It is dedicated to guiding political and economic activities in "Manchuria." Colonel Nagatsu is the section chief, with Lieutenant Colonels Hanatani, Tanaka, Akimizu, Suganami, Yoshioka, Okosachi, and Suzuki as staff members. All matters concerning Manchuria's politics, the imperial court, personnel, economy, mines, immigration, etc., are under the control of this section and are handled in cooperation with "Manchuria" according to the provisions of the Japan-Manchuria Protocol.</p>
<p>Furthermore, upon closer examination, many of the Kwantung Army officials have inexplicable connections with wealthy families in Japan. The driving force behind them is capital, which deserves special attention. (Hua Lian Electric Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Outlook for the U.S. Congress: Far East Issues Will Be the Focus</h3>
<p>Washington: According to a survey by the Associated Press of members of Congress returning to Washington to attend the session in January next year, they unanimously stated that the American people are now paying extremely close attention to the situation in the Far East, which is considered unprecedented. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives will thoroughly consider relations with the Far East. Issues related to silver worldwide will first attract attention across the Pacific. Whether criticizing or supporting the U.S. Treasury Department's silver purchase plan, they will inevitably discuss China's monetary policy and the international relations of that policy. Before the disastrous fall in silver prices, those who advocated the silver purchase plan strongly defended the policy and denied that it harmed silver-using countries. However, new phenomena will obviously lead to a discussion of the effectiveness of national programs. In addition, the future of the London Naval Conference and the demand for new naval bases in the Pacific are also closely related. If the conference fails to reach an agreement to limit navies, this relationship will become even closer. A majority of Congressmen and observers believe that this matter will clearly spark a debate on Japanese-American relations. From Senator Pittman's recent series of speeches severely condemning Japan, it can be seen that there will be a heated debate on Japanese-American relations after Congress opens. Secondly, the Philippine issue will probably attract attention, but observers do not believe that the independence bill will undergo significant revisions, as economic relations are still under investigation and are clearly a prerequisite for changing the bill. Finally, the issue of Hawaii's statehood will probably attract more attention than before. The House Territories Committee has held meetings in Honolulu to solicit opinions, and it is likely to issue a report. The United States and the Hawaiian Islands have become closer due to new aviation routes, which is also one of the reasons why the island's status must be given practical consideration. The air defense of Alaska is also an issue that has aroused general attention in the Pacific. The government has approved the fortification of the area, but the necessary funding has not yet been determined. (National News Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Trade Association: Inauguration Ceremony Postponed Indefinitely</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Economic organizations such as the Japan Economic Federation and the Japan-China Business Association, as well as Chinese economic organizations in Shanghai, held meetings in Tokyo and Shanghai respectively at the beginning of this month to discuss the establishment of the Japan-China Trade Association in Japan and the China-Japan Trade Association in China and made various preparations. However, recently, due to the reversal of Sino-Japanese relations, both China and Japan have had to postpone the inauguration ceremonies indefinitely. (Nichiren Electric Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Moscow: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was held in Moscow from December 21st to 25th. First, it discussed the problems of industry and transportation related to the Stakhanovite movement. It then discussed the results of checking party membership cards. Based on the resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, it decided to award the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and Certificates of Honor to male and female collective farmers of the Uzbek, Turkmen, Tajik, Kazakh, and Karakalpak republics for their heroic work and for increasing cotton production by 100% to 400%.</p>
<p>Moscow: The resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the inspection of party membership cards and documents pointed out that 93% of party members and 53% of probationary party members had been inspected, and ordered that the inspection should be completed by February 1, 1936. From January 2nd to 5th, all party members and probationary party members should immediately use new cards. The recruitment of party members, which was temporarily suspended at the end of 1932, will begin on June 1, 1936. Moscow: The first item of the resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Stakhanovite movement was to define the nature of the Stakhanovite movement's great development, which lies in adopting new organizational technologies for labor, rationalizing progress, and reforming the division of labor system to ensure the rapid development of labor productivity and increase wages. This movement raises the cultural and technical standards of the working class, breaks old technical standards, exceeds the labor productivity of advanced capitalist countries, rapidly increases the production of general consumer goods, reduces production costs, transforms the Soviet Union into the most prosperous country, and consolidates the position of socialism in the world. The plenary session stipulated that its task was to extensively develop the Stakhanovite movement in industry and transportation, with the aim of maximizing production, reducing costs, making better use of raw materials, labor, and technical equipment, and improving the quality of products. The plenary session believes that it is necessary to revise production standards based on the dramatic changes in productivity and the improved production experience of Stakhanovites, and to guide Stakhanovites to establish new production standards, help all Stakhanovites increase their technical knowledge, and organize special technical training classes for them. It will also gradually promote the compulsory acceptance of minimum technical knowledge training for male and female workers, and finally make this training a general obligation for all male and female workers. This important work is necessary to raise the cultural and technical level of the working class to the same level as engineers and technical workers. The plenary session also decided to stipulate specific tasks for the heavy industry, light industry, food industry, timber industry, and railway committees based on all of the above.

<h3>French Cabinet: Reviews the International Situation, Laval Explains in Detail</h3>
<p>Paris: The Council of Ministers was held at the Presidential Palace at 10:00 AM this morning. President Lebrun chaired the meeting. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval presented a report on the current diplomatic situation. He gave a particularly detailed account of the recent work of the League of Nations and the resignation of former British Foreign Secretary Hoare. Regarding the suppression of fascist organizations of a military nature, although the three bills proposed by the government to strengthen government authority have been passed by the Senate, the House of Representatives seems likely to propose amendments to the bills passed by the Senate. When the Council of Ministers discussed this issue, it decided that if the House of Representatives does propose amendments, the government will put forward a vote of confidence in an effort to pass the original bills. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Cabinet is scheduled to meet tomorrow. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval will provide a detailed explanation of the international situation and will also explain France's position on the proposed solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. This Cabinet meeting is highly valued by the general public because the House of Representatives is scheduled to discuss foreign policy and ask questions on the 27th of this month. This Cabinet meeting is intended to prepare answers. Those who will be asking questions include Radical Socialist Party member and former Minister of Aviation Caillaux, leader of the orthodox Socialist Party Léon Blum, and prominent right-winger Daiting Rui. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Paris: Regarding the suppression of illegal gatherings and associations of a military nature, the three bills proposed by the government to strengthen government authority have previously been passed by the House of Representatives, namely: The Minister of the Interior may dissolve military organizations that endanger the safety of the political system; those who illegally possess weapons will be severely punished; those who publish inflammatory remarks in newspapers aimed at inciting murder will be brought before the court for punishment, even if no effect occurs. After being submitted to the Senate for discussion, except for the first article, which amended the original order of the Minister of the Interior to dissolve to a resolution by the State Council to dissolve and was passed, the other two articles were passed as originally drafted. These bills have become law, and most of the military organizations on both the left and right have prepared to comply. One thing that these organizations have in common is that their "secret military equipment" consists mostly of clubs and few firearms. The following is a breakdown:</p>
<p>On the right: The Patriotic Youth League originally had a mechanized organization and has taken the lead in disbanding it and reorganizing itself into the "National People's Front." The league's propagandists will recruit members from the public to strengthen their momentum. The Croix-de-Feu (Cross of Fire) League has also prepared to disband and, since the 16th of this month, has taken various steps to organize the "French Social Movement" and shift its activities to the political sphere. Therefore, it is rumored that important figures in the Croix-de-Feu League plan to nominate candidates to participate in the elections when the House of Representatives holds its by-elections in May next year. However, the league's leader, Colonel de la Rocque, has consistently denied that he intends to present candidates. The French Fascist Party, led by Poujade.</p>
<p>The "National Union" League, founded by the late perfumer King Coty, is led by Renault. Members of both groups wear blue shirts, are small in number, and are not very important. They do not seem willing to give up weapons and remove their blue shirts.</p>
<h3>World's Longest Wireless Telephone</h3>
<p>From Moscow to Khabarovsk, 10,000 Kilometers Long</p>
<p>Moscow: The construction of the world's longest wireless telephone, from Moscow to Khabarovsk, has been successfully completed. The entire line is 10,000 kilometers long. (TASS Dispatch, 24th)</p>

Next year, radio stations will be built in Stalinabad, Alma-Ata, and other places, and there will be 3 million radios. Direct wireless telegraph and telephone lines are planned to be added between Moscow and Ashkhabad and Stalinabad. Wireless radio photo transmissions will be established from Moscow to Khabarovsk and Alma-Ata next year. (TASS Dispatch, 24th) On the left: The "Self-Defense Corps" organized by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party will resume their original names, namely the Socialist Youth League and the Communist Youth League. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris: Regarding the three bills proposed by the government to suppress fascist groups of a military nature, the House of Representatives will probably not be able to discuss them until Saturday, Sunday, or even Monday of next week. As for the House of Representatives' meeting this afternoon, it has been decided to discuss the government's proposed conscription law amendment, which advocates changing the term of military service from 18 months to two years, in accordance with the government's previous decision, and hopes to pass it before the end of the current special session of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The suppression of the fascist groups bill passed by the Senate will be reviewed by the Civil and Criminal Legislation Committee of the House of Representatives at 3:00 PM this afternoon. If the House of Representatives cannot complete the discussion of the conscription law amendment, it will not be able to immediately discuss the suppression of the fascist groups bill. At tomorrow's meeting, the questions raised by the members of the House regarding the government's foreign policy will be discussed. If it cannot be completed in the afternoon, the discussion will continue in the evening. In addition, the leaders of the various parties will hold a joint meeting before the House of Representatives meets in the afternoon to draft the entire agenda for the current special session of the House until the New Year holidays. It is generally believed that the House will not begin the holidays until after the budget for the next year is passed, and will then reconvene on January 14th next year. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>American Peace Movement: Over Thirty Organizations Hold Conference</h3>
<p>New York: A peace conference in support of peace convened here yesterday. The chairman was Columbia University Professor [John Dewey's Chinese name]. This conference was composed of over twenty domestic pacifist organizations. It advocated submitting a supplementary wartime neutrality bill to Congress when it reconvenes in January next year. The bill would be based on the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, clarifying the rights and obligations of each signatory nation. Simultaneously, it would augment the powers of President Roosevelt. The New York Times commented on this matter, stating that according to this bill, the President would not only have the power to prohibit the export of munitions to belligerent nations but could also include all necessities of war on the list of embargoed items. At the same time, the bill would prohibit lending money to belligerent nations and restrict American shipping. Shipping companies and exporters who suffer losses due to these restrictions would be subsidized by the government. If, in the future, a country is attacked, and the majority of the signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact recognize this as an act of aggression that conflicts with the pact, the President of the United States may, with the approval of Congress, lift the embargo on munitions and war supplies to the attacked country. Furthermore, it requested that President Roosevelt consult with other countries on a new treaty to clarify the rights and obligations of each signatory nation to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the establishment of countries affected by the war.

<h3>National Language Class Lecture: What to Read?</h3>
<p>— Xia Genzun, Director of the Editing and Translation Department of Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Middle school students, the program I am responsible for in this broadcast is the middle school national language course. There are several aspects to the national language course, and I would like to talk to you about reading. I plan to divide it into two lectures: the first will discuss "What to Read," and the second will discuss "How to Read." Today, I will first talk about "What to Read."</p>
<p>Before I get to the main text, let me first make a ridiculous argument: I believe that books will eventually disappear. Books are just a tool for providing knowledge, and providing knowledge does not necessarily require books. Think about how many years human history has been, and the history of books is very, very short in comparison. There were no books in ancient times, but humans were still able to survive. Their knowledge was not as advanced as that of modern people, but it cannot be said that they had no knowledge at all. This shows that books are not the only source of knowledge, and to gain knowledge, it is not necessary to rely on books. As for ancient events, we can only rely on imagination to say, or some may be unreliable. Let's look at the current situation. Today's lecture is being broadcast to you via radio. Suppose there are 10,000 of you listening, and if I speak well and it benefits you, then the effect is equivalent to 10,000 people each reading a book like "The Art of Reading" or "Reading Guidance." In addition to radio, we can also use movies. Historical events and scientific inventions, if performed in movies, have the same effect as reading history books and science books. Suppose there comes a day when wireless telephones and movies are very advanced and widespread, and the broadcasted materials are well-prepared to suit the needs of various people, then the use of books will gradually disappear, because these sharp tools can replace them. Because of imagination, we know that there were no books in ancient times, and in the future, there may be no need for books. The need for books can be said to be a phenomenon of a transitional era.</p>
<p>Today's topic is "What to Read." This argument just now may seem a bit ridiculous and irrelevant, but my intention is to use it to dispel many mistaken notions about protecting books. I also admit that books are still useful today. We live in today's world, and the most common and economical way to acquire knowledge is still to read books. However, many of the reading concepts that have been passed down are incorrect. Some people regard reading as an elegant and refined thing, treating books as playthings and antiques, as if books are unrelated to practical life and reading is a leisure activity outside of practical life. Some people regard books as the only tool for learning, thinking that the so-called seeking knowledge is just another name for reading, and that there is no source of knowledge outside of books. Both of these views are wrong. The former error is more common among ordinary people, while the latter error is more common among young people, especially you middle school students who hold books every day. I believe that books are just one of the tools for seeking knowledge. In order to live, and to enrich our living skills, we must seek knowledge. So-called knowledge is definitely not an ornament, but only a skill used to cope with life and change life. For example, we learn physics, chemistry, and mathematics because we want to survive in the natural world, utilize the natural world, and understand the conditions of the natural world. We learn about world conditions, and study world history and world geography because we want to be human beings in the world. We learn our own country's history, geography, and civics because we want to be the current Chinese people. There are various ways to learn. Sometimes we need to use experimental methods, sometimes we need to use observational methods, and sometimes we need to use exercise methods. It is not always necessary to rely on books. Only because books are written in words, and words are the most convenient thing, can everything in the world and all the principles be recorded. When printed into books, they can be read anytime and anywhere. Therefore, books have become an important tool for seeking knowledge, and it is worth everyone reading them.</p>
<p>The above is my evaluation of books, and below I will talk about today's topic: what to read.</p>
<p>What books should young people read? This is a big question that has been around since ancient times. Many people have expressed many opinions on this question since ancient times. In the past ten years, this question has also been very lively. Several gentlemen have made book lists for young people, among which the lists made by Mr. Liang Qichao and Mr. Hu Shih are relatively famous. Many of you must have seen these lists. Today, I don't want to make another list for you, I just want to roughly tell you a few directions to start with.</p>
<p>I want to connect reading and life into one piece and make them inseparable. In my opinion, reading is not an elegant pursuit, but a means of improving and enriching life. Books are not just entertainment after tea and wine, but tools for cultivating knowledge and skills in life. What books a person should read, and what books to look at, should be determined and selected according to his own life. I advocate dividing the scope of reading into three categories: one is related to one's own duties, two is for reference, and three is related to hobbies or cultivation. For example, a person who is an internal medicine doctor should first read books and magazines about internal medicine. This is reading related to duties and belongs to the first category. The second is books that are not directly related to one's duties, but can be used as a reference for research, making one's specialized knowledge richer and more accurate. If the doctor, due to the study of malaria, notices the types of mosquitoes, he will flip through a certain biology book, and because of the distribution of malaria mosquitoes, he will flip through a certain geography book. Because of the nature of a certain drug, he will check a certain plant book or mineral book. Because of a doubt about a certain word, he will check a certain dictionary. This is reference reading and belongs to the second category. Again, this doctor, in addition to his duties as a doctor, naturally also has a life of hobbies or cultivation. In terms of hobbies, if he likes to play chess, he may want to look at books about Go. If he likes photography, he may want to look at books about photography. If he likes literature and art, he may want to look at books such as poetry and novels. In terms of cultivation, if he is determined to cultivate his character, he will naturally read biographies of famous people or classic maxims. If he feels that his body must be exercised, he will naturally read books on swimming, sports, etc. This is still reading in terms of hobbies or cultivation and belongs to the third category. The first category of books about duties is different for each person. What a banker should read is different from what an engineer should read, and what an agriculturalist should read is different from what a musician should read. The second category of reference books are those that are related to specialized business research at any time, and no fixed number can be drawn. As for the third category of books about hobbies or cultivation, people should be allowed to freely choose them separately. In short, reading and life should have a close relationship.</p>
<p>Above, I divided the scope of reading into three categories: one is related to personal duties, two is for reference, and three is about hobbies or cultivation. Below, I will base on these principles and speak to you middle school students about the question of "What to Read."</p>
<p>First, let's talk about reading about duties. What are your duties? You are middle school students, and your duty is to study the various subjects in middle school. You may become officials, lawyers, open stores, or become teachers in the future, each with their own duties, but now you are all receiving secondary education in middle school. Studying the various subjects prescribed by the middle school well is your duty. The books you should read in your duty are none other than the various textbooks prescribed by the school. You may think my words are boring, or some people may say that we hold textbooks every day to attend classes and leave classes, and we are already companions with textbooks every day, so why do you need to bother us again? However, I say these words with a sincere attitude, I am confident. To tell you the truth, I have also been a middle school teacher for many years. According to what I know, not many middle school students can read textbooks well. Some middle school students like to read novels and casually read magazines, putting textbooks aside. Some middle school students love to read English or Chinese, but get headaches when they see physics, chemistry, and mathematics books. This is obviously a kind of biased bad phenomenon. Although the general students do not have this biased situation, they also seem to fail to make full use of the textbooks. Textbooks are specially compiled for learning, and what is recorded is only the outline of various subjects. They are not particularly great works, but they are still valuable tools for learning. To learn a subject, one should use the textbook as a foundation, and then expand from all aspects, adding various practical efforts such as comparison, observation, and proof. It is not enough to just read it a few times haphazardly. For example, the reading material in the national language class is usually compiled from a few selected texts. Suppose a national language textbook has a total of thirty articles. It is not enough for you to just read the thirty articles a few times. You should base on these articles to do all kinds of further study. Such as grammatical habits, rhetorical methods, the style of sentence division and paragraph division, etc., you must learn according to these articles and acquire key knowledge. Just remembering the few stories or opinions recorded in the article cannot be considered to have learned the national language. To give another example, there are many exercises in mathematics textbooks. You have to practice them one by one. On the one hand, these exercises are the practical application of theorems or principles, and on the other hand, they make you more clear about the theories or principles you have already learned. For example, there are various patterns of four arithmetic problems, chicken and rabbit calculations, time calculations, father and son age calculations. If you only practice the individual exercises and cannot discover the common relationship or law in these exercises, you cannot be said to have mastered the four arithmetic operations. According to this condition, reading textbooks is not an easy and simple task. There are more than a dozen subjects in middle school, and the textbooks for each subject should be read well equally, because learning these subjects is your current duty. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia's Transportation Policy in the Far East Gradually Succeeds: A Black Line Can Traverse Eastern Siberia: Soviet Russia's New Plan After Abandoning the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Starting from the Taixide Station of the Siberian Railway, bypassing the city center of the gold mining area north of Lake Baikal, passing through [Russian name] to the new port of Komsomolsk near the lower reaches of the Heilongjiang River, the Bay-Black Railway, i.e., between Lake Baikal and the Amur River, is actively progressing. According to information from colleagues in Harbin, the railway has recently been fully opened to traffic. At the same time, the construction of two branch lines connecting the Amur River and the Bay-Black Railway from the cities of Tavdma and Mukhta of the Amur Railway to the Bay-Black Railway has also been completed. In addition, a new line from Komsomolsk, the end of the Bay-Black Railway, to the Baichigari station of the Ussuri Railway is currently under construction and is scheduled to open to traffic next spring. In addition, the double-tracking project of the Amur Railway has been completed, and a new line from the Kuligorig station of the Ussuri Railway to Soviet Bay (formerly known as Imperatorskaya Gavan) is also planned to be completed soon. As a result, Soviet Russia's Far East transportation policy has largely succeeded. Komsomolsk, which it regards as the main place in the East, was once a fishing village on the bank of the Heilongjiang River, but now it has become a city with a population of 80,000. Various heavy industries and military facilities are not only complete, but also in an unusually active state. It is said that the Bay-Black Railway was built by the Soviet authorities after the Northeast Incident, feeling uneasy about eastern Siberia, in order to ensure the country's territory, and is the world-renowned second Siberian Railway. Since February of this year, when Soviet Russia handed over the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japanese expatriates, it has concentrated its energy on the Bay-Black Railway with the funds obtained from the road and a large part of the old employees of the East Road, and is actively carrying out construction. It is scheduled to start business in the middle of next year. If this railway is fully completed, Soviet Russia can traverse the treasury of eastern Siberia without using the Amur Railway and reach the Sea of Okhotsk, opening up a new long-distance route to the East. At the same time, it will not only obtain many political and economic benefits, but also obtain extraordinary convenience in military affairs. Therefore, the news of Soviet Russia's construction of the Bay-Black Railway has caused great excitement among the Japanese.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Outer Mongolia: Everything is Controlled by Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Kūlún Correspondence: Outer Mongolia was originally our country's territory, but it has long been neglected by our people. The following is a special record of its situation to arouse the concern of our people:</p>
<p>Various Industries: Agriculture is extremely rare in Mongolia. Even where it exists, cultivation and sowing are done using very primitive methods. The most prosperous agricultural areas are near the northern Siberian border, around Kūlún, in the river basins of the Orkhon River, Kharaa River, Selenga River, etc., and the Kobdo area. Production is limited to barley, wheat, rye, and beans. The total cultivated land is 43,000 hectares, of which 39,000 hectares are cultivated by people from mainland China. Therefore, the Soviet government strongly encourages agricultural production in the area. There is a state-run farm in Kobdo, and collectively operated group farms are also gradually emerging. Forestry is also quite flourishing in the mountainous areas of the northwest. The government now prohibits indiscriminate logging and implements forest protection policies. The rivers of Outer Mongolia are rich in fish. This is because the Mongolians adhere to Lamaism and abstain from eating fish and birds. These foods are mainly consumed by foreigners residing there or entirely used for export. Due to a lack of statistics, it is impossible to know. Mineral resources include gold, silver, platinum, lime, lead, asbestos, rock salt, iron, copper, etc., but due to insufficient investigation, it seems unlikely that active mining can be carried out at present. In the mountainous areas, the gold produced is mostly placer gold.</p>
<p>Trade Situation</p>
<p>Before independence, trade in Outer Mongolia was entirely controlled by residents of mainland China and Russians. After independence, most of it was taken over by state-run commercial organizations. A small portion is still handled by the Mongolian Bank, the Soviet-Mongolian Trade Joint-Stock Company (a Soviet state-run agency), British chambers of commerce, Chinese merchants, etc. Major exports are livestock, meat, sheepskin, leather, animal hair, intestines, and fats. Imports include flour, grains, sugar, tea, and tobacco. The statistics of their export and import values are recorded below (unit: 1,000 rubles):</p>
<p>1924</p>
<p>Exports: 19.376</p>
<p>Imports: 18.196</p>
<p>Total: 37.572</p>
<p>1927</p>
<p>Exports: 25.253</p>
<p>Imports: 24.608</p>
<p>Total: 49.861</p>
<p>Furthermore, trade between Soviet Russia and the Outer Mongolian Republic has advanced even more rapidly. The following table shows this (unit: 1,000 rubles): From 1925 to 1926, Soviet Russia exported 3.670 to Outer Mongolia, and Soviet Russia imported 3.735 from Outer Mongolia, totaling 7.445. From 1927 to 1928, Soviet Russia exported 7.546 to Outer Mongolia, and Soviet Russia imported 2.089 from Outer Mongolia, totaling 19.635. Examining the industrial and commercial aspects further, leather industry is the primary industry in Outer Mongolia. Although other industries have also decided to establish factories, the scale is very small, so they are omitted for now.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Transportation</p>
<p>Mentioning Mongolia immediately brings to mind the vast desert. Indeed, the famous Gobi Desert lies within Mongolia. In fact, Outer Mongolia, except for the areas bordering Inner Mongolia in the east, which are mixed with desert areas, the mountainous areas of the northwest, and the river basins of the Kerulen River and Onon River in the northeast, are still prosperous regions. The northwestern mountainous area of Outer Mongolia has many large mountain ranges running parallel east-west. The foothills of these mountains are usually covered with forests, and countless rivers flow between them. Lakes and marshes of various sizes irrigate various regions. In the plains, high-quality pasture abounds, making it a natural nomadic area for Mongolians. For example, the word "Khangai" in the Khangai Mountains means a place rich in forests, pastures, and rivers, sufficient to satisfy the ideal homeland of nomads. The large rivers in the Outer Mongolia and Siberian areas all originate in these mountainous areas, irrigating various parts of Siberia. The lakes and marshes scattered throughout the mountainous areas include Lake Khuvsgul, the largest lake in Mongolia. It is 5,000 feet above sea level, a freshwater lake surrounded by cliffs, and 500 meters deep. Mongolians call this lake a sea, and small steamboats can navigate on it. Next are Lake Buusan, Lake Khar-Us, Lake Airag, etc. Most of these lake waters are saline, containing a high-quality natural soda. The Mongolian climate is purely continental, with severe winters and hot summers. The temperature changes drastically throughout the year. There are no railways in Outer Mongolia. Domestic and international transportation all follows the old paths, that is, the main lines used by camel caravans since ancient times, and small roads with very few people passing through. The main transportation routes centered on Kūlún City are listed as follows: From Zhangjiakou to Kūlún, the distance is 1,060 kilometers. This road is accessible by car. There is also a car road from Kūlún to Kyakhta on the northern border. Goods and passengers travel frequently. The distance between the two places is 370 kilometers. From Kūlún via Uliastai to Kobdo, and from Kobdo you can reach Koshi-Agach village in western Soviet Russia. The distance between Kūlún and Uliastai is 1,060 kilometers, between Uliastai and Kobdo is 450 kilometers, and between Kobdo and Koshi-Agach is 370 kilometers. From Kūlún to Kerulen is 720 kilometers. From there, you can take a car road to Manzhouli. From Uliastai via Zerek Uss to Zhangjiakou, the distance is 1,700 kilometers. In the above-mentioned places, the means of transportation are mostly horses, camels, and Chinese horse-drawn carriages, but the use of cars has gradually increased. In addition to these roads, river transportation is available on the Selenga River and its tributary, the Orkhon River, where the state-run Selenga Steamboat Company operates. There are wireless radio facilities between Kyakhta and Kūlún, allowing for telephone communication. The airline was built by Soviet Russia. There are regular flights from Irkutsk to Kyakhta and Kūlún. Telegraph services are generally available in major cities.</p>
<p>Major Cities</p>
<p>Mongolian cities are centered on Lama temples and can also be called religious cities. In reality, only Kūlún can be called a city. This place flourished after the Living Buddha, the supreme religious leader of all Mongolia, established a large Lama temple here. The other cities have not shed their tribal form. Only Kūlún has implemented a municipal system. Ulaanbaatar (Kūlún) is the name changed after Outer Mongolia's independence. Before independence, it was called Kūlún. In Mongolian, Kūlún means palace, temple, monastery. The Living Buddha established a large monastery here in 1646. The exact population of the area has not been statistically determined. It is generally estimated to be 70,000 people. The name Uliastai also means "dignified one." Before independence, it was the residence of the Chinese Amban and was once a political center. Today, the Soviet Russian consulate has gradually become an economic center. The population is 6,000. Kobdo is the center of the two parts. Before independence, the Chinese Deputy Amban resided here. There is also a Soviet Russian consulate here. The population is around 3,000. Kyakhta crosses the border between Soviet Russia and Mongolia. The residents within the Outer Mongolian territory are mostly Chinese merchants and Mongolians. Those living within the Russian territory are all Soviet citizens. This place is the center of Russian-Mongolian trade. The above is a relatively thorough investigation of the current situation of the so-called Mongolian Republic. In fact, although it is nominally our country's territory, we only maintain empty suzerainty over it.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising: Li Liejun Composes a Poem</h3>
<p>Receiving Guests with the Same Heroic Spirit as Before; Composing a Poem on the Spot with Deep Emotion</p>
<p>Beijing News: The Yunnan Uprising to overthrow Yuan Shikai and protect the Republic is one of the most glorious chapters in revolutionary history. At that time, the highest-ranking leaders in charge of this campaign were Cai E, Li Liejun, Tang Jiyao, and Liu Xianshi. Cai, Tang, and Liu have now passed away. Of those who initiated the movement and are still alive today, admired by people, only Mr. Li remains. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the uprising. There are enthusiastic commemorations in Beijing and other places. In Beijing, in addition to the Central Party Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Yunnan Beijing Fellow-Provincials Association holding commemorative ceremonies, Mr. Li also hosted a banquet at his residence in the Lingyuan Xincun to welcome guests. On that day, those who went to offer congratulations included Feng Yuxiang, Sun Ke, Cheng Qian, Zhang Ji, Bo Wenwei, Qin Zhen, Lu Zhonglin, Zhu Peide, Li Zonghuang, Lu Chao, and over a hundred others. Mr. Li's residence was decorated with lanterns and colorful hangings, and the four golden characters "Golden Horse and Azure Rooster" were erected in front of the door. In the living room, there was an inscription that read, "Returning to the battlefield, wielding weapons, relying on the strength of the masses; crossing the donkey, carrying wine, reminiscing about the past," and the couplet "Pouring plain wine to honor the ancestors; wanting to use a loyal heart to awaken the national soul," the calligraphy being exceptionally vigorous. Feng Yuxiang also presented a couplet, "Forming an alliance in Xufu, the friendship is as deep as that of brothers; remembering the old days in Nanjing, the sorrows are deeply felt." Mr. Li received the guests with a vigorous spirit. His speech at the banquet had the same heroic spirit as in the past. The gathering did not end until 8:00 p.m., when everyone dispersed in high spirits. On that day, in addition to publishing an article entitled "Memories of the Yunnan Uprising," Mr. Li also composed a seven-character poem "Ode to History on the 20th Anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising": "The mechanisms of Zen shift hosts and guests in constant succession; the past events of Yin and Zhou cannot be without reason. Xiang Yu mistakenly drew the Hong Canal again (Xiang Yu abandoned the Three Qins and then drew the Hong Canal, thinking to conserve strength for the future, how foolish!); the lord of Shu favored close ties with the Wei warlord (Marquis Wu of Xiang established the national policy for Shu, to ally with Sun Quan in the east and resist Cao Cao in the north; after Guan Zhuangmu's defeat and death, Liu Xianzu wanted to attack Wu. Marquis Wu objected, but sadly echoed the personage of Fa Xiaozhi, only Zhao Yun said, 'The enemy is Cao Cao, not Sun Quan!'). Crossing the river, they forgot the two iron chains (Emperors Huizong and Qinzong did not heed the words of Zong Ze and Li Gang to recover the three towns. Gaozong fled to Lin'an, favoring the Jiangyou area, driven to the sea, heading toward national ruin, what else can be said!). The Eastern Expedition will see the four steeds tamed (Duke Zhou's Eastern Expedition calmed the four states; before the expedition, people doubted him; after the expedition, the four states obeyed). Wanting to use the regrets of past and present rise and fall, to awaken the national soul and devise great actions!"</p>
<h3>Closure Project Completed: Construction Actively Underway</h3>
<p>Former Closure Association Personnel Transferred from the Department; The Riverbed of the Old River is Increasingly High, Causing Extreme Concern</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Kong Xiangrong, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, was ordered by the Economic Committee to take over and continue the Dongzhuang Yellow River Closure Project. The official handover took place on the 16th of this month. In addition to the remaining construction funds of 200,000 yuan after settling the accounts and expenses of the Closure Association in Jinan, personnel were dispatched to take over. As the Dongzhuang project and the material yard are of great importance, Kong personally went to take over. The handover is now complete. The original workers of the Closure Association who were on the job have all been transferred by the Provincial Department of Construction and the River Affairs Bureau. After the handover, they have successively departed for Jinan. The construction site is now under the responsible command of Liu Bingzhong, Director of River Defense for the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. Kong Xiangrong himself serves as the chief engineer, continuing the project. After completing the handover, Kong reported to the National Economic Committee by telegram. Recently, the Economic Committee sent a telegram to Kong, stating that the current cold weather and shallow water are opportune for the closure project, and it should be carried out quickly. The telegram also inquired whether Kong had made any changes to the original closure plan, and if so, he should submit a report in advance. A reporter recently visited a gentleman who had just returned to Jinan from Dongzhuang and inquired about the recent progress of the project. The following is a summary of what he said:</p>
<p>Current Status of the Project</p>
<p>The closure work has been carried out with great effort since the beginning. Materials are being actively transported. More than 8,000 cubic meters of stone have arrived. New projects, such as the Jiangsu Dam, originally had ten sections, and four more sections have been added, making a total of fourteen sections. The new diversion dam has been built for more than 1,200 meters, and only a hundred meters remain to be completed. However, the original purpose of repairing the dam was to divert the flow back to the river and reduce the water from the breach. Now that the project is about to be completed, the diverted water is too far away, and its effectiveness has been lost. The new Li Shengtun Dam had already been built with seven sections. After the handover, one of the dams recently collapsed. Now, Chairman Kong has set a deadline of three days to dig a diversion canal, still hoping to guide the large water flow from the breach back to the river. However, the riverbed of the old river is now silted up and high, and the water tends to flow downward. The diversion canal is lower than the old river, and it is feared that it will not be very effective. Mr. Todd, an engineer from the American Asiatic Construction Company, which previously contracted for the Lijin Gongjia Closure Project in this province, visited Dongzhuang on the 4th of this month and praised the rapid progress of the project. He said that when he contracted for the Gongjia project, he started construction on December 4th, but now he sees that much of the project has already been completed, hence his praise. According to Mr. Todd's opinion, it is best not to allow the new river channel to be dredged too deep, for fear that after dredging, the outflow from the breach will become smoother, making it more difficult to divert the water back to the old river. Furthermore, Xu Shida and others from the Tianjin Hydraulic Engineering Society also visited the site and praised the rapid progress of the project.</p>
<p>Silting Up of the Old River</p>
<p>The gentleman also said that the Dongzhuang closure is not difficult, but the silting up of the old river is extremely concerning. In the past year, the Fenglou breach in Henan caused water to enter Shandong and then enter the Jin Dike, which could then re-enter the main river at Taochengbu. Above Taochengbu, the water in the old river was shallow, almost drying up. Last year, the Huangtai breach in Henan again caused water to enter the river at Taochengbu via the Jin Dike. This year's Zhuang breach caused water to exit the breach and then enter northern Jiangsu, with one part returning to the Daqing River, re-entering the main river at Jianggou in Dong'a County. The Yellow River carries a large amount of silt. During floods, the water flow is rapid, and the scouring force is strong, so the silt does not settle. If the water is slow, the silt will inevitably raise the riverbed. Now, during the large floods of the Yellow River in the past two years, the water in the section above Taochengbu has been shallow. This year, during the large flood, the water above Jianggou was again shallow. Over the past three years, the riverbed has silted up and become higher than before. Therefore, even if the Dongzhuang breach is closed in the future, during each large flood, the riverbed will be high, and the drainage from upstream will be slow, which will have a negative impact. This is truly concerning. Now, the old river above Taochengbu has become clear water. The area near the Dongzhuang breach has also become a stagnant pool. Above Jianggou, due to the size of the river, boats cannot travel, and only ferries can come and go. After the breached water returns to the Daqing River, it re-enters the river at Jianggou, accounting for only a third of the flow. The Dongzhuang breach is becoming wider and wider, and large ships can pass through. The breached water enters northern Jiangsu via Nanyang Lake. When the lake water is high, the breached water is supported by it, and the drainage is slow. When the lake water drops, the outflow from the breach will be even smoother.</p>
<h3>Shandong Yellow River Disaster Relief Association Cables Request: Fair Allocation of Disaster Relief Bonds</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Li Shuchun, Xin Zhujiu, Zhao Xinru, He Supu, Li Wenqi, and Zhen Jicheng, members of the Shandong Province Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, requested a fair allocation of the disaster relief bonds, as their distribution is controlled by the Disaster Relief Association. They specifically telegraphed the National Economic Committee, the Ministry of Finance, and the Disaster Relief Committee in Nanjing. The original text reads (omitting titles): "Please be aware that the Tianjin Yishibao newspaper published on December 16th that the Disaster Relief Association would distribute 20 million yuan in disaster relief bonds to Jiangsu and Hubei. This province has suffered from the Yellow River flood this year, submerging more than ten counties and affecting millions of victims. Accommodation and relief require a large amount of funds. The situation of insufficient relief funds was reported in a telegram on October 10th. Moreover, the disaster in Shandong is more severe than in Jiangsu, Hubei, and Anhui by several times, yet the number of bonds allocated to us has not been disclosed, causing widespread anxiety. On behalf of the victims, we implore you to allocate the disaster relief bonds more generously to aid in relief efforts. With utmost sincerity, (December 23rd)."</p>
<h3>Wang Yongbin Inspects Anhui Judiciary</h3>
<p>Wuhu Courts Have Few Backlogged Cases; Wang Warns Judges Not to Detain Defendants Excessively</p>
<p>Yanhu Correspondence: Wang Yongbin, Minister of Judicial Administration, accompanied by Wang Fengxiong, Counselor of the Ministry; Chen Nairong and Liao Zixun, Section Chiefs; Liu Enrong, etc., traveled by car along the Nanjing-Wuhu Road to the area to inspect the judicial situation in Anhui Province. At 9:00 a.m., they arrived in Wuhu. After resting briefly at the Southeast Hotel, they went to the Third High Court Branch, the Wuhu District Court, the Second Model Prison, and the Detention Center for inspection. Wang Zhennan, President of the Third High Court Branch and President of the Wuhu Court, and Zhu Cheng, Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, accompanied them to answer questions. Wang reviewed the case files of murderers who had already been sentenced to death and the cases that had not been closed before July. He also sent Zhu Nairong to audit the accounts. Then, he gathered all the staff of the two courts, judges and prosecutors, for a speech, mainly stating that judges must close cases quickly, must not be careless, must strive for fairness, and must ensure that the people are convinced. It is best if the cases of this month can be closed within this month, so as not to cause the parties to suffer from the pain of litigation. Prosecutors must not be afraid of trouble and detain defendants excessively, because our country was originally a family-based society, and the whole family often relies on one person for their livelihood. Detaining one person is tantamount to harming several people. Legal provisions must not be arbitrarily invoked, because according to the provisions, most defendants can be detained. Some people advocate abolishing this kind of prosecutorial system that deprives people of their freedom everywhere, and this is the reason. We should pay special attention to this. He continued, stating that he advocated unblocking prisons and clearing backlogged cases. Since the implementation of the three-level, three-trial system on July 1st, he had traveled to North China to inspect and was pleased that there were very few backlogged cases. Next January, he planned to inspect Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and in March, he planned to inspect Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, etc. According to Wang's inspection, the judicial situation in Wuhu was generally very good, and there were few backlogged cases. However, the detention center was small and held inmates from both courts, which was insufficient. He instructed Director Li to prepare an expansion plan on the open space to the north, and the funds would be subsidized. Also, the hospital ward in the Second Prison was too narrow. However, a large-scale prison has now been built in Xuancheng, and inmates from the two Wuhu courts can be transferred there in the future. It was found that there were fewer than 400 inmates in prison, but the goods produced were many and of good quality, which proved that there had been significant progress. After Wang finished his business in Wuhu, he took a car at 2:00 p.m. to visit Zheshan Park, a scenic spot, and then went to the Shanxi Fellow-Provincials Association in Wuhu for a welcome reception. At 4:00 p.m., he took the Wuhu-Tunxi highway to Xuancheng, and then traveled to various places in southern Anhui, about two days. He will return to Beijing via Wuhu again (December 24th).</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Empty Rice Boats Robbed by Bandits</p>
<p>Seven boats purchasing rice were traveling from Shanghai to Tongli Town and were sailing upstream on Taihu Lake. Six boats were ahead, and the last boat suddenly encountered a boat from Jiangbei blocking its path. Under the pretext of loading empty rice boats, the boat owner and crew were forced to submit while the ship was ransacked. As there were no large sums of money, the bandits were angered and violently stabbed the boat crew, Gui Sheng, several times, on his forehead, chest, shoulder, and other parts. Bleeding profusely, he immediately collapsed. The bandits then returned to their small boat and sailed away. Later, the boat owner, Zhang Jinsheng, took him to Zhangliantang, and the Tapanshi boat arrived in Songjiang on the afternoon of the 26th, taking him to the Ruose Hospital for treatment. The boat owner went to Shanghai to report to the rice store. It is now known that the boat crew's injuries are not serious.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Several Inches of Snow, Students March</p>
<p>It snowed lightly in Suzhou a week ago, but it soon stopped. On the afternoon of the 24th, the weather suddenly changed, the sky was overcast, and the climate was severely cold. Around 3:00 p.m., snowflakes began to fall, and the snowfall increased in the evening, continuing all night. By 3:00 p.m. on the 25th, snow was still falling, with 9 to 6 inches of snow accumulated on the ground. Farmers were all overjoyed. The patriotic movement of students from major middle schools in Suzhou has been briefly reported in this newspaper. More than 100 students from Cuiying Middle School disregarded the cold and set off in a marching column on the morning of the 25th, marching and lecturing on Chuangma Road and Guanqian Street, and formed a security team to prevent overstepping bounds. Several hundred students from Soochow University and Fuzhong Middle School also formed a propaganda team, which divided into groups and went to various villages such as Mudu and Huguan on the morning of the 25th to propagate to the farmers. Suzhou Agricultural School also formed a propaganda team and went to various villages to propagate. Teachers and students from the County Rural Normal School jointly telegraphed the Beijing Student National Salvation Association, expressing their support. Zhang Hanwei, Director of the Public Security Bureau, specifically instructed his subordinates to properly protect the students' patriotic movement at all times.</p>
<p>Tongnan</p>
<p>Security Team from Tong Prefecture Heads to Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Chen Guofu, Commander of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Force, scheduled to train soldiers on New Year's Day of the 25th year of the Republic. The six counties of Tong Prefecture jointly dispatched a large security team to participate. The team gathered in Tong and on the 27th, Captain Yuan Ke of the Shanhai Department led the team to the province.</p>
<p>Tax Police Raid, Addressing Symptoms and Root Causes</p>
<p>The counties of Tong Prefecture have repeatedly suffered from tax police raids. Commissioner Xu of the Nantong District, together with the county magistrates of Tong, Rugao, Hai'an, Chongming, Qidong, and Jingjiang, telegraphed the provincial government and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that personnel be dispatched to stop the raids and that the system be improved to address the root causes. The provincial government replied that the relief of tax police raids, addressing both symptoms and root causes, was essential. In addition to reporting the situation to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance for separate handling, the county governments were also notified.</p>
<p>Qingjiang</p>
<p>Coroner Assaulted During Corpse Examination</p>
<p>Guo, a woman of the Hengji Township, Seventh District, was 49 years old. Her husband had died early, and she raised a son. The family was well-off. She suddenly died on the 23rd. Her son was at his uncle's house. Upon returning home and learning of this, he asked his cousin, Guo Zhongyou, to report to the county for an examination to clarify the cause of death. The county government dispatched coroner Xu Jichang on the 24th to conduct the examination. The results showed that there were no injuries on the body, and death was due to illness. However, Guo Zhongyou, on the grounds that she was healthy the day before her death, questioned the cause of death, claiming that her waist was purple and there must be other reasons. He led 600-700 onlookers to surround Xu and assault him. Xu suffered minor injuries to his face, and his clothes were torn. The clerk and bailiff were also affected. When the government heard the news, it sent police to rescue them, but Xu had already fled in panic. Now, in addition to requesting the High Court to send a deputy to re-examine the body, the county government is waiting to arrest the ringleader and punish him severely to deter lawbreakers.</p>

<h3>Rural Life Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor: Yu Qingtang, Yang Yishui</p>
<p>4.  The Lifestyle of Mountain People Farming Fir Trees on Fir Tree Mountains</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Fir Tree Mountains.</p>
<p>Fir Tree Mountains are mountains where fir trees are planted. Fir trees generally take about twenty years to grow into timber. Once mature, the fir trees are usually sold as a whole to merchants who hire people to fell, process, and transport them, and then sell them to experts in Hangzhou and Shanghai. Landlords mostly do not manage it themselves. After all the fir trees are taken down the mountain, tree peonies and tung trees can be planted. Thus, the first step of mountain field leasing begins. Mountain people do not own mountains themselves, and there are no fields around their homes. All their clothing and food depend entirely on the results of their labor on the mountains. Therefore, the news that there is a mountain near them available for rent is more important to mountain people than anything else! Because the area of ​​mountain fields is generally very large, landlords do not divide and rent them out piecemeal. Mountain people do not have the strength to manage it alone, so they must unite dozens or hundreds of tenants from nearby villages to rent together. However, fearing that they will be left out of this list of successful tenants, they often prepare some gifts—such as eggs—to send to the landlord before the lease is finalized. They hope that the landlord will give them special consideration when leasing out the field and put their names on the tenant list. As a result, all the mountain people give gifts, and the landlord is happy to have a batch of harvests in advance. When leasing out the field, everyone is given special consideration, which in turn allows the rent of the mountain to be raised even higher.</p>
<p>When leasing out the field, the landlord does not require all the tenant mountain people to be responsible. He selects a few relatively wealthy farmers from the mountain people to be "tenant heads." The "tenant heads" are responsible to the landlord for collecting rent on his behalf, supervising the planting of fir seedlings, and taking care of everything. They are even more considerate and thoughtful than the landlord himself. At the same time, they also get a commission rebate from it. The lease terms are generally a five-year lease, at most six years. After the term expires, the mountain must be returned, and replanting is not allowed. Rent is divided into two types: cash rent and in-kind rent. In addition to paying rent, mountain people have the obligation to plant fir trees without compensation. After the mountain is barren, the fir trees grow into a forest, and in the twentieth year, it can be sold as a whole again. The cash rent is based on the harvest money of the first year as the standard, about two to three yuan per dan. It is paid in one lump sum when the deal is finalized, and no further rent is charged. However, this first year's cash rent payment condition is a huge difficulty for poor farmers who generally have no income. They pawn all their furniture and farming cattle clean, and sometimes they still cannot raise enough money. Therefore, they mostly prefer to pay in-kind rent. The in-kind rent is split 30/70 during each year's harvest (the landlord gets 30%). Ten days before the harvest, the "tenant head" goes to the landlord's house to notify him of the harvest date. One day before the due date, he respectfully invites the landlord to visit the mountain field, inspect it for a week, and prove that there is no "reckless act" of harvesting before paying rent, and that the fir seedlings are planted very regularly. After permission is granted, the next day, the mountain people will gather with all the tenants and go up the mountain at the same time. At this time, the landlord will sit securely in the mountain people's thatched shed, waiting quietly to divide the tree peonies that the mountain people have harvested from the cliffs and precipices. Ah, the landlord has the aura of an emperor!</p>
<p>When the landlord comes to the thatched shed to divide the rent, the pigs and chickens that the mountain people usually raise are slaughtered and brought to entertain the landlord at this time; the rice that they usually plant, little by little, is also turned into white rice at this time and brought to offer to the landlord; the little "mountain goods" that they usually collect in the mountains are also taken out to show respect to the landlord at this time. After the landlord has finished dividing the rent, he has a belly full of food, a basket full of tree peonies, sits in a sedan chair, and supervises the mountain people to transport it to his home for him.</p>
<p>The second year is the same set of procedures, the third year... the fifth year, the fir trees grow into a forest, and the mountain is returned after the term expires.</p>
<p>The mountain people live in thatched sheds, eating thin gruel and drinking soup, while the landlord returns home to calculate: how much more is this rotation of rent and interest than the previous rotation?</p>
<p>5. The Lifestyle of Mountain People Managing Firewood Mountains</p>
<p>Let's take a look at Firewood Mountains.</p>
<p>Firewood Mountains cannot be cultivated, so these mountains can be said to be left barren for a long time. Because the soil is thin and stony, there is no large-scale leasing. The use of Firewood Mountains for the mountain people is that the miscellaneous firewood and wild trees on the mountain can be used to burn charcoal after more than ten years of growth. The business of burning charcoal is also run by merchants. The merchant buys the firewood from the landlord as a whole, hires workers to fell, burn, and transport it. Naturally, all the work is done by the mountain people. The mountain people get meager wages from the merchants, the merchants get profits from the mountain people's sweat and blood, and the landlord sits at home and gets a portion of the profit as the mountain price (firewood price).</p>
<p>Before the firewood grows into a forest, the landlord must prevent theft or fire from burning the mountain and must hire people to guard the foot of the mountain all year round. This hiring system is a typical medieval one. Hiring people to guard the mountain field is not limited to one mountain person alone. The landlord hires the entire family of a mountain person, and sometimes the entire village of a mountain person (no more than ten families at most). After these mountain people are hired, they do not receive wages from the landlord. They can only choose a piece of land with thicker soil or on the mountainside at the foot of the mountain they are guarding to plant some necessary food. They can also go to the mountain to cut down some necessary trees to build a few thatched sheds. They live on the land in the mountains, and the sheds are built with the landlord's grass and trees. Therefore, this thatched shed is of course also owned by the landlord. It is only "temporarily occupied" during the guarding period. The hired mountain people have the obligation to pay attention to the movement of every plant and tree on the mountain day and night, and they have the obligation to report the state of the mountain field to the landlord regularly throughout the year. When reporting, they have the obligation to offer "mountain goods" as gifts. Where on the mountain a tree has grown that can be used to repair the pigsty in the landlord's house, or where a gap has been washed away by a mountain flood, the hired mountain people must run to the landlord to report at any time. When the landlord's family is busy with farming or needs to find someone to work, the hired mountain people must immediately run to serve without compensation. If the landlord is satisfied, he will allow them to be hired for a long time, otherwise, they will not even be qualified to be a "miserable servant."</p>
<p>Mountain people are connected to the landlord by such bonds! Chains! and live their lives.</p>
<p>Let's leave this Arcadia! This is the east bank of the Tongjiang River in Zhejiang, which China claims is prosperous and culturally advanced. (The End)</p>

<h3>People Carrying Silver Coins Should Not Be Confiscated Unless Smuggling: Ministry of Finance Telegraphed Yesterday to Request Compliance</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed yesterday to Chairman Chiang and telegraphed to the governments of each province, each city, each pacification director, each commander, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, etc. (titles omitted) Since the implementation of legal tender, in order to facilitate the exchange of legal tender for holders of silver coins, this Ministry immediately stipulated eight methods for exchanging legal tender, which were announced and implemented. For remote and backward areas where legal tender is temporarily unable to circulate, the original habits are temporarily allowed to be maintained, and silver coins and silver should be sent to the nearest exchange agency to exchange for legal tender for circulation. These have all been telegraphed successively. Recently, it has been secretly reported that local military police sometimes fail to understand the intention of the law and take the opportunity to make things difficult for ignorant people who carry a small number of coins, or intercept and confiscate them on the way to exchange them for legal tender, causing innocent people to suffer and the public to be confused, so that people who hold silver coins and silver do not dare to go out to exchange them. If this is true, it will seriously affect the promotion of legal tender. Now that it is the New Year, the villagers are rushing to the cities to buy supplies. The above situation should be corrected immediately. All local military police should not confiscate the silver coins carried by people from areas where legal tender is not circulating for the purpose of shopping, unless it is determined that they are smuggling for profit. However, they should order the receiving shops to send them to the nearest exchange agency to exchange for legal tender. For ignorant people who do not understand government orders and carry silver coins, they should immediately be directed to the nearest exchange agency to exchange them for legal tender. As for those who carry them to exchange agencies to exchange for legal tender, they must not be intercepted on the way to avoid causing disturbances. If anyone deliberately violates this, the people should be allowed to accuse them and severely investigate them. If anyone deliberately conceals, intends to evade taxes, or collects, traffics, operates privately, or seeks profits, they should still be dealt with strictly according to the law once discovered. In this way, compassion is combined with preventing malfeasance. I respectfully telegraph this for your review and request that you telegraph all military police agencies to comply. (Or specially telegraph for your review and telegraph your subordinates to comply and publicize it widely. Or specially telegraph for your review and telegraph your branches to be informed.) The Ministry of Finance, You, Wei, Qian, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command Proclaims Martial Law by Order</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command proclaimed yesterday that it had received a telegram from the Military Affairs Commission, opening the matter with a high-ranking "Youzi" declaration: "Having received an order from the National Government stating that the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Commander, the Nanjing Garrison Commander, the Wuhan Garrison Commander, and others have reported that since the Beiping students' petition incident occurred, some traitors have taken the opportunity to cause trouble and plot to incite chaos, resulting in people's hearts being restless and public security being precarious. It is imperative that the Military Affairs Commission issue an order to declare martial law in necessary areas to maintain order. Please be informed that Shanghai and its surrounding areas are of great importance. Martial law should be declared immediately, and the said Commander is appointed as the Martial Law Commander of the Shanghai and surrounding areas. A separate order will be issued to inform you of the detailed area. Please comply with this order and implement it conscientiously to ensure public security. This order, etc., is hereby received. This Command has already declared partial martial law in this garrison area on the 24th of this month. Now, in accordance with the aforementioned reasons, we hereby announce to the garrison area that martial law will be implemented in accordance with the Martial Law Act from today.

<p>It is further reported that since the student movement in this city occurred, reactionary elements have been thinking of taking the opportunity to act. Recently, in various schools, there have been non-students from this school and non-students who have been lobbying from within, inciting them in various ways. This phenomenon is not only harmful to school safety but also related to the public security of the entire city. This city is now under martial law. The Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command has received secret reports from various sources and is now actively investigating. In the future, if this type of non-student and other instigating elements are discovered in various schools, the school authorities will be allowed to immediately send them to the local military and police agencies for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Students Petitioning in Nanjing Passed the Wuxi Station Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Authorities in Nanjing and Shanghai Rushed to Persuade Them to Stop</p>
<p>The student petitioning group to Nanjing, although a portion of Tongji University students returned to Shanghai on the advice of the previous day, the brigade of students who had driven to Suzhou had reached the Wuxi Railway Station before dawn yesterday and had already reached the area of ​​Shitangwan. The railway bureau, by order, dismantled the tracks to prevent the student train from passing through, but most of the students, not afraid of trouble, repaired them themselves and added water and coal along the way, frequently sounding the whistle, as if they had no difficulty in driving. The petitioning train of old students having reached Wuxi, the local resident military police and constabulary still adopted the peaceful persuasion approach of the authorities, but it seemed that it was still ineffective. It was heard that the stationmaster of Zhoujing Lane Station had been taken hostage by the students and traveled with the students, taking the opportunity to ride a handcar. At the same time, the authorities in Nanjing were informed and strictly ordered the railway authorities to consult with the military police to properly persuade them to stop, so as to ensure that they would not advance further west. The student petitioning group in Wuxi has been suffering from the cold for several days, and a small number of young male and female students are already mentally exhausted, but with the trend of public opinion, it is not convenient to act alone. However, the students' families in Shanghai are very worried. In addition to sending a telegram to Wuxi County Magistrate Long Tiyao to take care of them nearby and caring about the students' safety, the Shanghai Municipal Government also sent Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, accompanied by Ministry of Education Secretary Ma Zongrong and Fudan University President Li Denghui, to Wuxi to join the representatives of the Nanjing Court and Department to earnestly persuade them. According to various sources, it is estimated that they will all return to Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, it was reported from Wuxi last night that the train is now stopped at Gaoqiao, two kilometers west of Wuxi Station, and has stopped advancing. Gu Zhenglun, the Capital Garrison Commander, specially rushed from Nanjing to join Wuxi County Magistrate Long Tiyao, Ministry of Education Representative Secretary Ma Zongrong, Supervisor Sun Guofeng, and Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan to persuade the students to return to Shanghai first, and then send representatives to Beijing next month to meet with Chairman Chiang and present opinions on safeguarding the country. After being persuaded, the students unanimously agreed and promised to return to Shanghai. Commander Gu, satisfied with the successful outcome, specially instructed the railway bureau to repair the tracks and prepare to drive them back to Shanghai. Once the repairs are completed, they are expected to depart and return to Shanghai tonight or tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>The Situation in Shanghai is Peaceful</p>
<p>The city was extremely peaceful yesterday. Except for a few middle schools that had an early winter vacation, all schools were attending classes with peace of mind, and there were no parades or other events. Guanghua University held a general meeting of all students at 1:00 p.m. and expressed its acceptance of Chairman Chiang's instructions. At that time, it will select representatives to go to Nanjing to present their patriotic opinions. At the North Station, although there were police officers guarding the station, the order was extremely quiet. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and the Shanghai-Songhu branch line were operating as usual (however, passengers taking the Hangzhou train must board at the South Station). Once the students in Wuxi return to Shanghai, traffic on the two lines will be restored.</p>
<p>Increased Train Schedules</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway was blocked, all long-distance buses operating on the Shanghai-Wuxi highway and small inland ferries departing from Shanghai have increased their fares by a hundredfold. Therefore, all long-distance highway buses and inland ferries have increased their schedules to facilitate passengers. However, the bus routes that connect to the train along the road from Shanghai to Wuxi have been suspended.</p>
<h3>The General Closing Period for the Money Industry is Set for January 23</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the closing period for this year has been determined by the money industry to be January 23. It will be publicly implemented after the members' representatives' standing committee approves it. The request to reduce the interest rate on loans has been agreed to be considered by the three banks. The Banking Association will hold its 8th members' standing committee meeting tomorrow. The industry is steadily passing the New Year and there is no fear of general closing. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>General Meeting of Members of the Silver and Money Industries</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association has internally set the 24th year as the general closing period, January 23. It was submitted for discussion at the executive committee meeting the day before yesterday and it was decided to submit it to the first members' representatives' standing committee meeting of the third session at 2:00 p.m. on the 31st of this month and it would be publicly announced immediately after approval. The Banking Association has decided to hold its 8th general meeting of members at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow. In addition to reporting on association affairs, it will also discuss amendments to industry regulations and approve the application of five banks, including Sichuan Meifeng Bank and Jiangsu Farmers Bank, to join as members.</p>
<p>Double Closing is Steady and Worry-Free</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned yesterday from the silver and money industries that each bank and dealer has traditionally taken six months as a period for long-term credit loans, namely the end of April and the end of October. The amount of credit loans and mortgage loans due at the end of the year and the general closing period this year is very small. However, the overdrafts of each bank must be paid in full at the end of the year, and the overdrafts of each money dealer must be paid in full at the general closing period. Fortunately, one is December 31 and the other is January 23. Therefore, each industry and business first overdraws from the money dealer to repay the bank at the end of the year, and then overdraws from the bank to repay the money dealer at the general closing period. In this way, the steady passage of this year's double closing period can be determined to be worry-free.</p>
<p>Considering the Money Dealers' Request to Reduce Interest Rates</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously allocated 25 million yuan of the Republic of China 24th Year Financial Bonds to aid the money industry and formed a Money Industry Supervision Committee to transfer 18 million yuan of loans that the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications had agreed to temporarily postpone repayment, reducing the interest rate accordingly. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the banking industry yesterday that the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have agreed to consider this. As for the three banks, as the end of the year and the general closing period are approaching, in order to regulate the finances of the money industry, following the old practice, they have handled interbank lending.</p>
<p>Promoting Bills to be Submitted to the Ministry for Approval</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee allocated 3 million yuan for the promotion of acceptance bill funds under the credit small loan item. After the money industry association approved the principles and the banking group drafted the implementation methods, the loan review committee has now approved it and has submitted the opinions of the silver and money industries to the Ministry of Finance for approval. After approval, it will be implemented on a scheduled basis. However, due to the busy implementation procedures, it is expected that it will not be implemented until after the general closing period.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Students Staying at School Form a Petition Group Support Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday, They Hosted Reporters to Explain the Petition's Motives and Released a Declaration to Retain President Li Denghui</p>
<p>Yesterday, Fudan University students who remained at the school specially organized the "Support Association for the Beijing Petition to Punish Traitors." It was divided into four groups: Intelligence, Fundraising,慰劳(consolation), and Publicity. In the afternoon, they hosted reporters from various newspapers in the university library to report on the truth of the students' Beijing petition and the situation in the past few days. All the students of the school were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, endured the cold and hunger, and fought against wind and snow, vowing to achieve the purpose of going to Beijing to petition. Their motive was pure. Because a few members of society in this city had some misunderstandings about this, it was necessary to explain it. The purpose of the school's Beijing petition was to assist the students in Beiping, awaken the people to overthrow all traitors and collaborators, support the government, and preserve the integrity of the territory. The motive was genuine, and there was no need to doubt it.</p>
<p>Retaining the President</p>
<p>President Li Denghui has been at the school for 30 years. The achievements of the school today cannot be buried, and Li Denghui values Fudan more than his own life. In the past few decades, although some people have invited him to enter politics, he declined because he did not want to leave Fudan. Regarding the students' decision to go to Beijing to petition, Li Denghui also expressed his deep agreement. However, regarding the petition, since he had received a telegram from President Chiang, it could be said that there was a considerable result, so he strongly urged the students to return to school and seek a practical way to save the country. However, the students, in a state of anger, were unwilling to return to school. Li Denghui then announced his resignation. All the faculty, staff, and student associations of the school believed that Fudan could not be without Li Denghui for a day and would not allow him to leave. Therefore, they issued a declaration to firmly retain him. The walls of the school were covered with slogans to retain Li Denghui.</p>
<p>Support Work</p>
<p>After the establishment of the support association, the work was quite tense. The main tasks were to convey messages from the front and rear, transport food, and receive donations from various parties. Yesterday, the International Radio Station and other places sent a large batch of food to the school's support association, which was then forwarded to the front, it was said.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that President Li is to us like a nanny to an infant. An infant cannot survive without a nanny. How can we imagine what we would do if we left President Li? Our President Li has devoted his life's energy to seeking the development of Fudan, working diligently day and night, for 30 years as if it were one day. Fudan today has such a solid foundation and has had so many glorious historical achievements, all of which were achieved by President Li's hard work. This great spirit and noble personality not only makes all our faculty, staff, and students love and respect him, but also makes people in society praise him highly. Recently, all the students, driven by patriotism, marched to Beijing to petition. Our President Li did not want to sit idly by and watch the hardworking students abandon their studies, nor could he bear to thwart the patriotic youth's heart to save the country. Furthermore, he received orders from the government to urge him to find ways to dissuade them, and public opinion also encouraged him to lead them well. Our President Li, although he painstakingly persuaded the students to return to school, our students, due to their eagerness to save the country, had to disregard the President's instructions. In this situation, President Li was in a dilemma, so he had to resign to seek compromise. However, the pain in the heart of our President Li is self-evident. Who would want to eat wind and snow to quench their hunger and thirst? Who would want to trek a long journey and sleep outdoors all night? Everyone knows that young students should bury their heads in hard work to prepare to serve the country. However, at this time when traitors are everywhere, barbarian cavalry are running rampant on our territory, and Japanese planes are flying in our airspace, the country is in danger. How can we feel at ease to study in this situation? Everyone knows that young students are the backbone of the country and the lifeline of the nation. Driven by a sense of responsibility and burdened by conscience, we can only throw away our pens and books, shout and run around, regardless of all the hardships and cold and hunger, only seeking that the country can survive and the nation can be revived. If we can achieve our goal, we will not regret dying. We hope that President Li will return to school immediately to preside over the school administration. We hope that President Li will lead us to face the national crisis together. We shout, support the virtuous and respected President Li, support President Li in leading us to face the national crisis together. Dear President Li, have mercy on us and come back quickly. We wish our President Li health, long live President Li, long live Fudan University, respectfully submitted by all the students of Fudan University, November 26th.</p>

<h3>Journalism Departments of Central Political School and Other Universities Jointly Petition for Improvement of the Censorship System</h3>
<p>Censorship and Legitimate Speech Become Tyranny. Three Principles Essential for Fully Exerting Power</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports: The Journalism Departments of Central Political School and other universities jointly submitted a petition to the central government yesterday, requesting improvement of the current news censorship system. The original text reads: (Titles omitted) "Petition to request improvement of the current news censorship system to liberate public opinion and promote public will. We have learned that the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee resolved to request the government to earnestly protect legitimate public opinion and improve news censorship, demonstrating that the authorities already know the impropriety of suppressing public opinion and are seeking to correct it. A government that wishes to achieve internal unity and external claims must rely on public opinion as its backing. The formation of public opinion begins with discourse. Therefore, opening up discourse and communicating information is the only way to broadly solicit public opinion, and the ability of government power to be fully exerted depends on it. At this time when national disaster is imminent, when it is urgent to advocate public opinion, those of us engaged in journalism education cannot but express our views on the current news censorship system. Examining the news censorship system, regardless of whether it should exist in theory, if it can be handled properly, it may not necessarily be harmful. It cannot be said that there is no need for our country's authorities to censor news. However, at the beginning, it was only intended to prevent reactionary propaganda. Gradually, it has repeatedly expanded its scope, and even legitimate news that is disliked by censors or local officials is prohibited. Thus, censorship has become tyranny, and newspapers, under heavy pressure, have lost their function of disseminating information, guiding society, exposing hidden dangers, and punishing evil forces. They now only deal with insignificant news or paint a rosy picture of the situation, going through the motions. This is heartbreaking. We believe that in order for news censorship to fully exert its power, it must possess the following three principles: All Chinese and foreign newspapers in the country must be censored uniformly; There must be a centralized system; There must be fixed standards. If news censorship cannot be uniform, and newspapers run by foreigners in China can be exempt from censorship, it will not only prevent the general public who do not read foreign newspapers from knowing the true news of the situation, but will also easily foster a psychology of distrusting domestic newspapers, and provide enemies with opportunities for counter-propaganda. Taking the recent student movement in Beiping as an example, if Chinese-run newspapers record anything, it is temporarily removed, while foreign newspapers say what they want, and the censors do not care whether the facts are correct or not. The disparity in treatment is incomprehensible. If news censorship lacks a centralized system and fixed standards, with central policies at the center, local methods at the local level, and individual opinions from individuals, what is permitted by the central government may be prohibited by the local government, and what is permitted by one agency within a locality may be prohibited by another. Sovereignty is inconsistent, standards vary, and people are at a loss. Moreover, the censorship regulations set by the government are extremely vague. They appear orderly on the surface, but their application causes a myriad of problems. Therefore, we advocate that if the government cannot fully implement the above three principles, it should promptly abolish the news censorship system. If the news industry has misconduct, it should be handled by the judicial authorities in accordance with the law, so that speech can be liberated, and the general public can be aware of the severity of the national crisis and the government's response and policies. Their concept of defending the country will inevitably increase day by day, and their willingness to be a backing for the government will inevitably strengthen day by day. A truly united national spirit can be achieved without being expected. Therefore, we specially submit this document for your review, quick adoption, and implementation. We cannot help but appeal and look forward to it. Respectfully submitted by the Journalism Department of the Central Political School, the Journalism Department of Fudan University, the Journalism Department of Yenching University, the Journalism Department of Shanghai University, the Beiping School of Journalism, and the Guangzhou School of Journalism."</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Strictly Investigates the Forgery of Former Wuhan Treasury Bills</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a special public announcement yesterday, stating, "Recently, according to confidential reports, some unscrupulous people are taking advantage of the government's implementation of the legal tender system to forge a large number of treasury bills of the Ministry of Finance of the Wuhan government in 1927 in various places, hoping to defraud the people and disrupt the market. This is truly hateful. The procedures for the original treasury bills were incomplete, the number is unverifiable, and the forgeries are rampant, making it impossible to investigate. They lost their validity 16 years ago. Now, unscrupulous people in various places dare to forge them in large quantities, and it is feared that ignorant people will be defrauded. Strict suppression should be carried out to warn the troublemakers. Therefore, this announcement is made to all people, Chinese and foreign. If anyone uses these treasury bills to transfer, receive, defraud, or obtain property, once verified, they will be severely punished according to the law and will not be tolerated. This is a crucial announcement."</p>

To promote the National Products Year and strive to promote sports, to make the people unanimously consume, in order to reduce imports, recover rights and interests, and block leaks, is the only work of patriotism. In the past, the naming of Women's National Products Year and last year's Students' National Products Year was nothing more than to awaken the people and make them universally adopt domestic products. The association, in view of this, in order to continue its efforts to promote domestic products, specially decided by the joint meeting of representatives of domestic product organizations that (next year) 1936 will be named the Municipal National Products Year, and the Shanghai Municipal National Products Year National Products Sports Meet will be organized, and directors, chairmen, and standing directors will be elected to be responsible for carrying out the work, and it was decided to hold the opening ceremony of the Municipal National Products Year and the National Products Propaganda Lantern Parade on New Year's Day 1936. It is only reasonable to submit this document for record, for the public good."</p>
<h3>Shandong Fish and Salt Requested to be Exempted from Changing Color</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce Received a Reply from the Ministry Yesterday</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, in response to the request of Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on October 25 of this year, stating that changing the color of fish and salt hinders the fishing industry and requesting an exemption from changing color. The association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, Salt Letter No. 8186, stating, "The telegraph has been received and noted. Regarding the case of Shandong using red earth to change the color of fishery salt, the Shandong Rongcheng County Chamber of Commerce and others previously submitted a report stating that changing the color of fishery salt with red will affect the sales of fish and requested permission to continue using white salt. The ministry verified that, except for the Wang Guanchang fishery salt in Shandong, which is used for pickling fish in inland river fisheries and should still be prepared with a red color change, the remaining fishery salts in each field should be temporarily exempt from color change in order to avoid disturbances. Separate instructions will be given by the ministry for compliance. The previous situation in the telegram should be noted."</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Order: Strictly Prohibit Tearing Off Used Revenue Stamps</h3>
<p>Punishment According to Criminal Law After Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday instructed the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, stating: According to the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department Letter No. 20887, and the Tax Department's report, approved by the Ministry of Transportation's Directorate General of Posts Letter, which stated, according to the Shanghai Postal Administration's report, that recently it has been heard that some people in this city are going to major stores to solicit revenue stamps affixed to invoices from customers, perhaps intending to resell them, and it seems that measures should be taken to prevent this in order to avoid affecting tax revenue, etc. Based on this, it is verified that affixed and discarded revenue stamps should have an official seal or signature affixed across the perforations where the revenue stamp meets the paper surface of the original document, and they must not be torn off and reused. This has already been stipulated in Article 12 of the Revenue Stamp Tax Law. According to the aforementioned report, the matter concerns the scope of inspection, and a corresponding letter is sent for verification, etc. Article 12, Paragraph 2, of the Revenue Stamp Tax Law stipulates: "The aforementioned revenue stamps must not be torn off and reused." Article 19, Paragraph 2, of the same law states: "Those who violate the provisions of Article 12, Paragraph 2, will be punished with double the fine stipulated in Article 18." Furthermore, Article 203, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law stipulates: "Those who counterfeit or alter postage stamps or revenue stamps with the intent to use them shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than six months and not more than five years, and may also be fined not more than one thousand yuan." Paragraph 2 stipulates: "Those who use counterfeit or altered postage stamps or revenue stamps, or collect or deliver them to others with the intent to use them, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than three years, and may also be fined not more than one thousand yuan." Paragraph 3 stipulates: "Those who erase the cancellation mark on postage stamps or revenue stamps with the intent to use them shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year, detention, or a fine of not more than three hundred yuan; the same applies to those who use them." Thus, there are clear legal provisions for punishing the tearing off and reusing, altering, or erasing of stamps. If any cases are discovered, those who tear off revenue stamps for reuse, as well as those who alter revenue stamps with the intent to reuse them, or who erase the cancellation marks on tax documents, should all be transferred to the court for separate punishment according to law. If revenue stamps are torn off but not reused, and there are no traces of alteration or erasure, the inspecting personnel should confiscate the torn-off stamps, send them directly or forward them to the Ministry for verification and destruction, and thoroughly investigate where they were torn off from. If the original voucher still exists, they should also be ordered to affix another stamp according to law, and at the same time, a stern warning must be given to the effect that revenue stamps serve as tax vouchers, and once they have been affixed, they must be carefully preserved and must not be torn off, etc. Now that we have received a letter from the Directorate General of Posts stating that someone in Shanghai is soliciting revenue stamps on invoices from store customers, it is clear that they intend to reuse them. We cannot guarantee that the same situation does not exist in other places, and it is imperative to strictly prohibit this in order to uphold the law. In addition to issuing separate orders to the relevant departments to forward instructions to various inspection and spot-check personnel, and instructing the Directorate to order the Shanghai Investigation and Suppression Office and the revenue stamp commissioners dispatched to various provinces to pay attention to investigation and prohibition, we hereby consult your government for verification, and we hope that you will forward instructions to the revenue stamp inspection personnel at all levels to pay serious attention at all times. If any incidents of tearing off revenue stamps are discovered, they should be handled in accordance with the aforementioned measures in order to avoid affecting tax revenue, and we also hope to receive a reply, as well as our respectful regards, etc. We have approved this, and in addition to issuing separate orders to the Public Security Bureau, we hereby order the Bureau to forward instructions to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to pay attention. This order.</p>
<h3>Problem of Dividing and Governing the Shengsi Islands: Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association Cables the Executive Yuan Again</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Shengsi Islands, which belong to Chongming County, Jiangsu Province, being assigned to Zhejiang for governance, recently approved by President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, and ordered to the two provinces to conduct a joint survey and handover on a regular basis, the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association believes that the report cited a clever telegram from Yao Yongping, director of the Jiangsu Fisheries Experiment Station, expressing opposition, which is a reversal of the facts and confuses the hearing. The Association has jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan with the Dinghai and Fenghua Fellow-Provincials Associations to refute his telegram, saying: "To President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Interior, and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, We humbly investigate that the issue of dividing and governing the Shengsi Islands to Zhejiang has been repeatedly petitioned by the Zhejiang fellow-provincial groups in Shanghai to your Yuan and Ministry for presiding over the case. Now that the islands are about to be surveyed and governed, it is reported that Yao Yongping, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station, has cleverly telegraphed to express opposition, and pointed out that the islands are the center of Jiangsu's fisheries, which is deeply shocking. It is verified that fishermen from Jiangsu have always used sand boats, and can only engage in fishing in shallow sea fishing areas such as the Gangxin and Yangyang areas. Compared with fishermen from Zhejiang who use fishing boats to travel far across the ocean, their work locations are completely different. If we check the household registration of the residents of the islands, there are hardly one or two who belong to Jiangsu Province. Even during each fishing season, those who go to fish are all from Zhejiang. The facts are all there, how can we cover up people's eyes with one hand? If it is said that Jiangsu's fisheries will need to develop in the high seas in the future, it is the same as our country's fishermen and fishing, and there are no borders. Whether the islands belong to Jiangsu or Zhejiang has no benefit or harm to the province's fisheries. The intention of the telegram is nothing more than that if Shengsi belongs to Zhejiang, the station will be affected, so it is a far-fetched statement, hoping to confuse the public. The associations have seen this, so it is inconvenient to remain silent. We hereby send a special telegram to clarify, respectfully request your Yuan and Ministry to review and preside over, and expedite the handling, so as to solve the problem, and the suffering of the Jiangsu people is deeply felt. Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association Chairman Chu Hede, Dinghai Fellow-Provincials Association Chairman Liu Hongsheng, Fenghua Fellow-Provincials Association Chairman Yu Hualong."</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Railway Company Orders Locomotives from Poland</h3>
<p>Can Be Shipped to Shanghai on January 20 Next Year</p>
<p>Polish industry has seen rapid progress in recent years, especially in various railway materials, such as the construction of railway bridges, locomotives, and passenger cars. They are strong, durable, and enjoy a high reputation. Locomotives manufactured in Poland have been supplied to Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, and many other European countries in recent years. In addition, Turkey, French colonies in Africa, and other places have also placed many orders, because the materials are strong and the value is particularly low. The large iron bridge over the Songhua River in Harbin, China, was designed and built by Warsaw Lotzski Co., Ltd. of Poland. This year, the Jiangnan Railway Company of China ordered a large locomotive from the Poznan Locomotive Factory in Poland. The locomotive has been completed and has been handed over to the Blackheath for shipment from the port of Gdansk in Poland, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on January 20 next year. At the same time, the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company has also ordered a large number of parts from the factory.</p>

<h3>The Wife Did Not Show Grief At The Husband's Death: There Must Be A Hidden Story.  Her Covering Her Face And Pretending To Cry Was Completely Fake. Secret Investigation Could Reveal Suspicion.</h3>
<p>Chen Hongfu, a farmer from Yanji Jiao, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was murdered on the road on the evening of the 27th of last month. The local bailiff reported it to the Procuratorate of the District Court. Inspector Li Fen came to the scene to verify that he had been beaten to death before he died, and ordered the coffin to be prepared and the murderer to be arrested. It has been recorded in the previous newspaper. It is now known that when the judge examined the body, he suspected that the wife of the deceased, Chen Wang, did not show any signs of sadness. So the judge questioned her about it. The woman suddenly covered her face and pretended to cry. The judge knew that she was lying, so he ordered her to raise her head, but there were no tears at all. It was revealed that there must be a hidden story in it, and the police station in charge also found out that the woman was indeed not telling the whole truth. So they detained her and sent her to the court for questioning and detention. The inspector Li Fen, who was in charge of the case, thought the case was important, so he investigated the case secretly. He found out that the wife of the deceased, Chen Wang, and the deceased's maternal uncle, Lu Zhiliang, were suspected of being involved in the case. Therefore, he secretly ordered the police to go to the countryside to arrest Lu Zhiliang and detain him for interrogation. For the sake of caution, he instructed the detention center to stop all visits to Lu Zhiliang to avoid collusion. A public prosecution will be filed soon.</p>
<h3>Bombs Found Among Old Goods On Route Doumer: Causing Injury To Chen Abao and A Passerby</h3>
<p>At about 11:00 a.m. yesterday, Chen Abao, a 37-year-old local who collected old goods at No. 136 Lane on Route Doumer (i.e., Qingli) on the section of the road built beyond the border of Zhabei, received a lump of scrap metal that looked like an iron pipe from a passerby for two copper coins and placed it in a bamboo basket. Unexpectedly, after walking a few steps, there was a loud bang. Abao's hands and feet were injured, and a passerby was also affected. The passerby was an apprentice named Chen Ronggui, 17 years old, from Tongfu Noodle Shop on Qiujiang Road. After the accident, people came to inquire and reported the incident to the Zhabei Fire Rescue Joint Association by telephone. The association sent an ambulance to send the injured to the Renji Hospital on Rue Macgregor in the French Concession for treatment. Chen Ronggui's injuries were minor, and he was discharged from the hospital after being bandaged by the doctor, while Chen Abao is still staying in the hospital.</p>
<h3>Abandonment After Seduction: Flower Girl Files A Lawsuit. The Defendant Was Sheng Jingqing, Who Was Summoned By The Court Yesterday.</h3>
<p>Cai Zhiqian, a Haimen native who lives in Ximen, is 47 years old this year and has been making a living selling flowers. He has a daughter named Hongzhu, who is 16 years old this year, and has a beautiful appearance. She also takes a flower basket to various neighborhoods to sell flowers. Father and daughter are dependent on each other for a living. However, the daughter has not yet been betrothed and is waiting to be married. In October of last year, a friend of Cai named Fang, who worked in a Shanghai commercial field, came to Cai's door to be a matchmaker for his daughter, saying that his friend, Sheng Jingqing, a native of Pudong, the owner of the Xuxing Cotton Yarn Shop at No. 465 Beijing Road, was 30 years old this year and had recently lost his wife. He had seen Hongzhu's beauty and was interested in her, so he asked Fang to introduce them for marriage. If she was willing to marry, the happiness that would come would be endless. Cai had the intention of agreeing at the time, but because his daughter was still young and lacked knowledge, he attached a condition, requiring her to be sent to school for several years of study after marriage, so that if her husband changed his mind in the future, his daughter would also have the ability to support herself. As a result, Sheng Fang did not agree to the request, and the matter was put on hold and the marriage was called off. In April of this year, Fang suddenly took Sheng Jingqing's daughter to Cai's house, inviting Cai Hongzhu to go out to get a haircut on the pretext that he tricked Hongzhu into Sheng's house. Sheng immediately had physical relations with the girl with sweet words. From then on, he rented a house at No. 77 Tangjia Lane, Rue Massenet Ouest in the French Concession, and lived together. After several months, Sheng suddenly became tired of her and disappeared, abandoning Cai. Hongzhu had no choice but to go home and cry to her father. Then, her father, Cai Zhiqian, as the legal representative, accompanied his daughter to Chen Bingsheng Lawyer to act as an agent, and filed a lawsuit in the criminal court of the First Special District Court, accusing Sheng Jingqing of disrupting public morals. After a trial, the court ruled that the defendant lived in the Public Concession, but the crime took place in the French Concession, and informed the court that it had made an error in jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Second Special District Court for trial. The First Special District Court has transferred the case file to the Second Special District Court for handling. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Judge Li Changnian presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Both parties arrived in court with their lawyers. After the court first questioned the years and origins of the two parties, it declared that public attendance was prohibited because the case involved public morals. After hearing the plaintiff's father and daughter describe the defendant's adultery and abandonment, the defendant confessed that someone had proposed marriage before and wanted to marry the plaintiff's daughter as a concubine, but the matter was abandoned because the girl was short. He denied having adultery and living together. The court ruled that the case still needed to be investigated and witnesses needed to be summoned for further interrogation, and then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Materials Section Chief of Aviation School Abused Power and Escaped Privately, Was Arrested. The Second Special Court Extradited Him To The Public Security Bureau.</h3>
<p>Zhao Yansheng, a native of Zhuji, Zhejiang, is 21 years old this year. He was originally the chief of the materials section of the Hangzhou Aviation School, specializing in material storage, receiving, sending, and recording affairs. At the end of July of this year, he left his post without permission and came to Shanghai. After the principal and manager of the school checked the accounts handled by Zhao, they discovered that he had abused his power and embezzled nearly 2,000 yuan. Therefore, they legally requested the Nanchang Aviation Committee to issue an arrest warrant. Recently, Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau detectives learned that Zhao was hiding in Room 608 of the YMCA on Rue Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession. They immediately reported to the French Police Department and sent detectives to the address to arrest Zhao, bring him back to the police station, and send him to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Xiong Huige presided over the interrogation in the First Criminal Court. First, Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the Police Department, clarified the case and stated that he had no objection to the transfer. Then, personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau were sent to surrender the case and submit an official document requesting the transfer. When questioned, the defendant Zhao Yansheng confessed that he did not embezzle anything. In fact, he left the school due to disagreement and a difficult environment. As for the accounts, his cousin had already contacted him to pay the money, etc. The court reviewed the confession and ruled that the defendant Zhao Yansheng was allowed to be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Case of Confirming Invalid Land Sale Contract: Li Shizhongde Appeals, Stating Four Reasons, Court Opens Investigation Court</h3>
<p>After Li Pengxian, a major industrialist from Yong, passed away this spring, his second son, Yusheng, also died of illness. All the property left by Pengxian was managed by his eldest son, Yusheng. Now, Yusheng suddenly sold a land base of 0.517 mu located on North Meiyuan Road without obtaining the consent of his sister-in-law, Li Shizhongde (Yusheng's concubine), etc., and then forced his nephew Li Chenghao (the son of Shizhongde) to sign the sale contract, causing Li Shizhongde and her son to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court to confirm that the contract was invalid. At the same time, they also filed additional charges against Wu Jusheng and Gao Guifu, the owner. As a result of the first instance, Li Shizhongde lost the lawsuit. The woman did not accept the judgment and hired lawyer Yang Ruinian to appeal to the High Court. She stated the reasons for her dissatisfaction: When the contract was signed, neither owner was present, nor was the owner's name recorded on the contract. The form of the contract was originally illegal. If its establishment were to be allowed, the legal interests would not be protected. During the first trial, the presiding judge secretly studied the matter separately with Li Yusheng and the middleman Shen Xizuo, so their statements were contradictory. One said that all the owners were present at the time, and the other said that the owners were not present and were fully represented by the original middleman. If it were a formal sale, how could there be two different reasons? It is clear that it is a false sale. Li Yusheng had published a statement in the newspaper before the contract was signed, stating that the accounts of Pengxian Gong's Yingji Accounting Room had been fully settled. However, during the court hearing, he suddenly said that the proceeds from the land sale were all used to pay off debts owed by Yingji Company, etc., which is also contradictory. The appellant filed additional charges against Wu Jusheng and Gao Guifu based on the confessions of Li Yusheng and others. However, Gao Guifu was repeatedly summoned but never appeared in court, nor did he have a lawyer acting as an agent. Moreover, after the judgment, the judgment could not be served. The question of whether Gao Guifu actually exists is vague and confusing, leaving people feeling lost. It is necessary to investigate thoroughly. From the reason for the original trial's judgment, it was determined that the appellant had agreed in advance based on the confessions of the appellant's original wife, Zhou, and Yusheng's wife, Sun. It is important to know that the wife and Li Yusheng have a mother-son relationship and a brotherly relationship, and are in the same camp. They are in an opposing position to the appellant and others, and the testimony must be biased. The original trial did not investigate their relationship in detail, nor did it consider the background of the appellant and her son, resulting in being deceived. On the day of signing the contract, it happened to be the anniversary of the death of the late husband. The appellant and her son went to participate in the memorial ceremony and were forced to sign. If they had agreed in advance, then the name of Shizhongde, the legal representative, could have been added to the name of Chenghao on the contract. Why would it be necessary to publish a denial in the newspaper the next day? Furthermore, because Li Chenghao is still a minor, he is legally a person with limited capacity for conduct, so the contract he signed is difficult to establish. Therefore, he requested that the original judgment be revoked and that the judgment requested by the appellant be made, etc. The High Court approved the request and issued a summons. Yesterday, Judge Shi Meiyu opened the third court for investigation. The appellant and lawyer Yang Ruinian, and the appellee and lawyer Wang Fubi, were all present in court. After Judge Shi investigated the evidence, he ordered a retrial after changing it. It is also heard that the case of Li Jiaorong, the daughter of Li Pengxian, suing Li Yusheng and Li Shishi for property division has been settled through conciliation.</p>
<h3>Only One Robber Was Caught In The Railway Bureau Robbery Case, One Robber Is Still At Large, No Judgment Was Made Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the 23rd of this month, Xu Juyin, an employee of the accounting department of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, was carrying more than 4,000 yuan in legal currency to the engineering department of the bureau to pay salaries. He was robbed by bandits on the Yongdao of the Riverside Building on North Suzhou Road. Xu reported the case to the police station, and the police station sent detectives to arrest a robber named Lu. The next morning, he was escorted to the District Court of the First Special District. Under the interrogation, the judge ordered him to be detained for further interrogation because he still needed to investigate his accomplices. It has been reported in this newspaper. However, yesterday's report from a news agency stated that the police station arrested two robbers that day, and that the court had sentenced the robber with the knife to six years in prison and the robber with the rope to three years in prison. This news is completely inaccurate. Since the incident occurred, only the D’Esperey Road police station has arrested Lu Jingwen, a native of Haimen, and recovered more than 2,700 yuan in original stolen banknotes. No other police agencies have made any arrests. On the morning of the 24th, the police station escorted Lu to the First Special Court. When Judge Jiang Shuzi interrogated him, Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer for the police station, stated in court that there were two robbers at the time of the robbery, and one was still at large. Therefore, he requested that the recovered stolen money be returned to the owner first. Lu was still detained to await the arrest of his accomplices. The court approved the request and postponed the interrogation of Lu Jingwen for seven days. Lu was taken back to the police station for detention. No judgment was made that day, and only one robber was caught.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhengxi Was Arrested For Smuggling Silver Coins: Whether To Transfer Him To The Police Station Is Still Under Consideration</h3>
<p>Last month, the Zhenjiang police authorities arrested a man named Xiang who was collecting silver coins from the countryside and planned to export them. They found hundreds of yuan in silver coins and interrogated him strictly. The three suspects confessed that the act of collecting silver coins was ordered by Liu Yuxi, a native of Zhenjiang, who ran the Rongtai Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 269 Jiangxi Road in the Shanghai Public Concession. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance sent a letter to the Shanghai District Court, requesting assistance in detaining Liu for investigation. The court considered that Jiangxi Road was under the jurisdiction of the First Special District Court, so it transferred the letter to the First Special Court, requesting that it be handled according to law. The First Special Court approved the letter and issued a detention warrant to the police station, ordering it to be executed immediately. Then, Detective Wu Chunrong from the Chinese Detective Division took the warrant to the Rongtai Tobacco and Paper Shop on Jiangxi Road, arrested Liu Zhengxi, brought him back to the police station, and escorted him to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang said that the case occurred in Zhenjiang, so it was necessary to consider whether the police station should prosecute or send him to the mainland authorities for trial. Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the trial. Presiding Judge Feng Shide questioned Liu slightly and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Water and Electricity Company Revised New Regulations To Reduce Electricity Prices, Cancelled Discount System and Adopted Tiered System, New Regulations Will Be Calculated From January</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, in view of the fact that the original power of various factories mostly uses electricity, and the level of electricity prices directly affects the cost of each factory, and at this time when all industries are in decline, it should first reduce the burden on each factory. Therefore, for the electricity used for the original power of factories, it has re-established prices and cancelled the discount system, and changed it to a tiered system. The highest electricity price, which was previously 7 cents, has been reduced to 6 cents, and the lowest price can reach the cheapest price of 2.5 cents, so that each factory can give full play to its work efficiency by virtue of the low electricity price. The electricity price has also been changed to a tiered system. The highest is 18 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the lowest is only 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, which are divided into grades according to the amount of electricity used. The pricing of electric heating is also roughly the same. It is heard that it is even cheaper than the electricity price of the Shanghai Power Company. This is good news for electricity consumption in Zhabei. Now the regulations have been approved by the Public Works Bureau and submitted to the Municipal Government's Construction Committee for approval and announced for implementation. The newly revised electricity prices for 1936 are listed below: For electric lights, if the monthly electricity consumption is below 500 kilowatt-hours, the price is 18 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 500 kilowatt-hours but is below 1,000 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 16 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 1,000 kilowatt-hours but is below 3,000 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 14 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 3,000 kilowatt-hours but is below 5,000 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 5,000 kilowatt-hours but is below 15,000 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 7 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 15,000 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. For power, if the monthly average electricity consumption per horsepower is below 50 kilowatt-hours, the price is 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 50 kilowatt-hours but is below 150 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 150 kilowatt-hours but is below 250 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 4 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 250 kilowatt-hours but is below 350 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 350 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. For electric heating, if the monthly electricity consumption is below 500 kilowatt-hours, the price is 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 500 kilowatt-hours but is below 1,000 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 1,000 kilowatt-hours but is below 3,000 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. If it exceeds 3,000 kilowatt-hours, the excess amount is 4 cents per kilowatt-hour.</p>

The association has acknowledged receipt of the funds for distribution to the disaster areas and has also sent a letter to Hangzhou expressing gratitude.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Airlines No. 16 Forced to Land in Changshu the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Due to Weather Conditions, Passengers and Crew Are Safe: Pilot Returns to Shanghai, Personnel Dispatched to Transport the Aircraft</p>
<p>Eurasia Airlines flight No. 16, carrying three passengers (a chartered flight) from Shanghai on the 23rd of this month to Qinzhou, Shaanxi Province, flew back to Shanghai from Zhengzhou on the 25th. Around 5:30 PM on the same day, while flying over Changshu County, it was forced to land in a rice paddy in Yinzhuangjing, Mochen Township, due to a sudden change in weather. Fortunately, the aircraft and the pilot, radio operator, and other personnel were unharmed. The pilot has returned to Shanghai to report the incident, and personnel have been dispatched to transport the aircraft back to Shanghai. After receiving the information, a reporter from the East China News Agency visited Mr. Cha Zhenhu, the company's secretary, yesterday afternoon and learned the details as follows:</p>
<h3>Three-Person Chartered Flight to Qinzhou</h3>
<p>According to Secretary Cha, on the 22nd of this month, a passenger (surname kept confidential) chartered a flight to Qinzhou, south of Xi'an. The passenger paid a charter fee of over 1,000 yuan. The company then dispatched flight No. 16 on the morning of the 23rd, piloted by German pilot Mr. Schlieg. Mr. Hang Xiaozu, a radio operator, was also on board. After departing, the aircraft arrived at the Xi'an station that afternoon. As it was late, they stayed overnight there. The next day, the 24th, they flew from Xi'an to Qinzhou, arriving there in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Empty Flight Returns to Shanghai, Lands in Changshu</h3>
<p>After reaching its destination, the aircraft flew back empty on the same day and stayed overnight at the Xi'an station after it arrived. On the morning of the 25th, it flew back to Shanghai from Xi'an. After flying over Zhengzhou around 1:00 PM, the weather suddenly changed dramatically, becoming worse than in the Xi'an area. Because the aircraft was a chartered flight and was not equipped with a direction finder, after the weather changed, the aircraft slowed down to prevent an accident. Around 5:30 PM, after flying over Wuxi, it was already dark. The aircraft was not equipped for night flying, and the weather was very bad, with dense fog and clouds, so the aircraft could not see the ground lights. Therefore, the pilot lost his sense of direction and was forced to land in the dark sky in Yinzhuangjing outside Mochen Township in Changshu County. Fortunately, it was a rice paddy, so the aircraft and personnel were unharmed, which was very fortunate.</p>
<h3>Message to Shanghai, Company Dispatches Transport</h3>
<p>After the aircraft was forced to land, it sent a message to the Shanghai company, which reads: "To General Manager Li of Eurasia Airlines on Renji Road, Shanghai: Aircraft No. 16 landed safely in Yinzhuangjing, Mochen Township, Changshu County. Hang (referring to radio operator Hang Xiaozu)." After receiving the message, the company immediately dispatched personnel to transport the aircraft back.</p>
<h3>Yi Fangshuo's Lawsuits Continue Unabated: Another Concubine Sues for Separation: Vividly Describes Being Seduced, Loss of Virginity, and Abuse: Prosecuted for Obstructing Public Morality and Freedom:—Interrogated and Concluded by the Second Special Court Yesterday, Sentencing Scheduled for the 31st—</h3>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a native of Hangzhou and the head of the Jingshen Troupe, which performs slapstick comedy, is 44 years old. In addition to his legal wife, Ms. Jin, he has successively taken three concubines: Yi Didi, Yi Meimei, and Yi Caita. Besides Ms. Jin, who stays at home to manage household affairs, the three concubines also perform on stage. Last year, Yi was arrested and charged with raping his cousin, Yi Baozhu. After being interrogated by the Second Special Court, he was sentenced to three years in prison for restricting freedom. He appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent the case back to the Third High Branch Court for retrial. He was acquitted this autumn, released on bail. However, the Third High Branch Prosecutor was dissatisfied with the retrial verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. Unexpectedly, Yi's luck has run out, and civil and criminal cases have been filed against him one after another. Recently, Yi Baozhu sued Yi in the First Special Court for breach of contract, requesting a judgment ordering him to pay 3,000 yuan in compensation. The preliminary hearing has not yet concluded, and his concubine, Yi Didi, also known as Pei Yinbei, a 25-year-old native of Suzhou, has disagreed with Yi and has long sought a separation, which could not be resolved amicably. Pei Yinbei then hired two lawyers, Jin Xinmin (Xiong Bai) and Lou Yunmei, to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Yi Fangshuo of obstructing public morality and restricting freedom, requesting that he be investigated and punished according to law. The basis of her lawsuit states that the plaintiff grew up in a humble family and has a basic understanding of writing. She was engaged to be married at a young age, hoping to grow old with her husband. The defendant, seeing that the plaintiff was somewhat attractive, had Zhang Chane woo the plaintiff in every possible way, enticing her with sweet words and subtly encouraging her to break off her engagement with her former fiancé (Zhao Lanting, with whom she had been engaged for four years, broke off the engagement (on May 9, the 22nd year of the Republic)). The plaintiff, deceived by his words, lost her virginity on August 24th of the 20th year of the Republic at 147 Gange Road, and was renamed Yi Didi. Only a few days later, the defendant's hideous face was revealed, and he became fiercely domineering, forcing her to perform on stage in the extremely shameless "Four Teachings Song" slapstick comedy. The plaintiff, having lived in seclusion and unfamiliar with the performing arts, begged to be excused, tears streaming down her face. However, the defendant uttered threats and inflicted beatings. At that time, the plaintiff had been reduced to a female slave, enduring humiliation and swallowing her voice. For the past several years, she has been used for his profit day and night, subjected to his lewdness at night. Her wages were monopolized by him, and her actions were no longer free. Even during the coldest snowy days, fearing that the plaintiff and others could not bear the pain and would escape, he would force her to take off her heavy coat in his room, leaving her shivering in thin clothes as she returned to her room to rest. Only then did she realize that the defendant's purpose in seducing the plaintiff was not only to satisfy his animalistic desires but also to use her as a tool for making money. During this period, she witnessed countless instances that made her deeply believe that the defendant was not only a morally corrupt actor but also a scoundrel who trampled on women. There are many women who have been abandoned and reported to the police, such as Wang Lianfang and Xu Guizhen, among others. Now, the defendant shamelessly claims that they are his wives, concubines, or apprentices, and their tragic circumstances are identical to those of the plaintiff. Furthermore, the court recently convicted the defendant of crimes, and the kidnapping and rape of young girls and the sale of people are all factual. Therefore, the defendant's actions constitute violations of Article 296 and Article 298, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. The statement of reasons cites the judgment in case No. 116 of the 10th year of the non-character series: "The crime of seduction requires the intention of private gain, such as prostitution or profit." Additionally, the interpretation in Wan Er Tong Zi No. 37 states that "the act of buying and selling people, whether for prostitution or not, is legally invalid. If the reason for the purchase is seduction or private enticement, the relevant articles can be applied for punishment." He destroys the chastity of women, placing them under his control for life, treating them as concubines not recognized by law, which is inhumane and violates Article 29 of the same law, ‘seduction,' etc." Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court summoned the defendant and his lawyers to court yesterday. Friends and family of both parties were present in court, causing a large crowd. The former concubine stated that she willingly married me, and I spent 500 yuan as dowry, signing a contract in the presence of her parents. He denied any mistreatment or restriction of freedom and requested that he be declared innocent. After reviewing the evidence, the court ordered both parties' lawyers to argue their case, then adjourned the hearing and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 31st.</p>

<h3>Charity Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Opens This Morning at the People's Education Center</h3>
<p>This year's floods have caused widespread devastation. Although various sectors have generously donated aid, the disaster area is vast, making comprehensive assistance difficult. Moreover, winter is now upon us, with snow and ice covering the ground, exacerbating the suffering of the victims. The Shanghai Provisional Association for Relief to Flood Victims in Various Provinces, recognizing the gravity of its responsibility, believes that relief efforts cannot be delayed. Therefore, it has earnestly appealed to all parties for donations to aid the relief effort. Recently, the Xiangzu Calligraphy and Painting Society, which travels throughout the country to promote art and national spirit and is led by renowned art expert Wang Lan, has diligently collected various calligraphy and paintings by famous artists over the years. Recognizing the severity of this year's disaster, the society has generously donated over five hundred famous paintings to the Flood Relief Association, with all proceeds from the sales going to relief funds. The exhibition is scheduled to open this morning at 9:00 AM at the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road. According to the person in charge of the association, the exhibition features a large number of works, and those who have drawn lots to select pieces have been very satisfied. Although the exhibition is initially scheduled for three days, it will be extended if necessary. The Xiangzu Society's Mr. Wang Lan hopes that this calligraphy and painting exhibition will not only promote art but also foster the spirit of national revitalization. Therefore, it has received widespread praise from all sectors. We hope that kind-hearted people will attend and help to alleviate the suffering of the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Police Bureau is Planning to Expand Staff Dormitories: Expected to be Established in Early Next Month</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau staff originally resided freely without fixed accommodations. Since Mr. Cai Jingjun took over as the Bureau Chief, recognizing that the cost of living in Shanghai is high, and rent in particular is quite expensive, Mr. Cai, to show consideration for lower-ranking staff and to improve their daily living conditions, allocated 400 yuan per month, despite severe financial constraints, to establish a police bureau staff dormitory. The dormitory was located at No. 1 De Lane on Penglai Road. All bureau staff earning less than 50 yuan per month were eligible to apply for lodging, free of charge. Since it opened in July of this year, the dormitory has housed over 120 staff members. They maintain orderly schedules and live in an organized manner, which has greatly benefited low-income staff. Recently, due to the city government's financial difficulties, the bureau was ordered to pay salaries at 80% of their original value. Staff earning less than 60 yuan per month also petitioned Bureau Chief Cai yesterday, requesting permission to reside in the dormitory in order to alleviate their financial burden. Mr. Cai is currently reviewing the applications and is expected to approve them. He will also order the rental of more dormitories to expand capacity. A suitable location is expected to be found soon, and the expanded dormitory is expected to be established in early next month.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Prepares for a National Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County National Products Promotion Association plans to hold a national products exhibition for two weeks. They have specially appointed Mr. Zhu Zhenfan and Mr. Huang Tongsheng as the chief organizers to come to Shanghai and liaise with the Shanghai National Products Factories Joint Association. The association hosted a public banquet last night, attended by Mr. Lu Xingzhuang, Mr. Ma Jisheng, Mr. Jiang Shenhe, Mr. Sun Choucheng, and Mr. Ji Sinong. After discussion, they decided to use the former site of the Jiaxing North Gate National Products Company, from the first to the third floors, as the exhibition venue. They will also set up a temporary sales area, inviting all factories to sell their products at low prices, so that visitors can recognize and support national products. Entertainment activities will be held on the fourth floor to attract more visitors. The original date was set for the 11th of this month, but due to insufficient preparation, it has been postponed to February.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Chief Cai Convenes Chiefs Yesterday Afternoon for Instructions: Provides Important Guidance on Public Security</h3>
<p>Recently, with the rise of the national salvation movement in Shanghai, cunning and treacherous elements are taking advantage of the opportunity to stir up trouble in an attempt to disrupt public order. After the Shanghai Garrison Command, the Municipal Police Bureau, the Security Department, and other military and police agencies ordered their subordinates to strengthen vigilance and maintain local security, Municipal Police Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun, fearing that reactionary elements might incite disturbances during this period of surging patriotic sentiment, convened a meeting of all branch chiefs, district chiefs, and police officers at Penglai Road at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to provide instructions on important public security matters.</p>
<h3>Refusal to Pay Property Tax Case: The Municipal Council Submits Supplementary Statement of Reasons (Continued) 24th</h3>
<p>The defendant claimed that "the plaintiff has no right to collect taxes from the defendant, nor can it file a lawsuit against the defendant." According to the treaty and agreement, the plaintiff can legally exercise its powers. As mentioned above, the payment of municipal taxes by citizens is considered a matter of course by people of all countries and regions, and it has never been seen as news or a strange event. The defendant resides within the public concession, enjoying all the rights of a concession resident. The enjoyment of rights and the assumption of obligations are inherently related. To enjoy the rights of a citizen without shouldering any responsibilities, there would be no place for the defendant to stand in the world. The plaintiff, according to the provisions of Article 9 of the Land Regulations, has the right to collect taxes from the defendant. At the same time, it is natural to resort to a competent formal court to seek redress against the defendant, who only knows his rights but not his responsibilities.</p>
<p>The defendant claimed that "the plaintiff cannot clearly express its intention, but only divides it into areas for foreign residents." The concession was never intended as a place of residence for Chinese people. In fact, at that time, Chinese people did not need to reside in the concession. The initial Land Regulations of 1845 had such provisions in Articles 15 and 16. Later, due to the Taiping Rebellion in 1851 and the Small Swords Society disturbances in 1853, a large number of Chinese people moved to the concession to seek refuge. Thus, when the concession was established, there were less than 500 Chinese residents. Within ten years, the number increased to 500,000. After the revolution and civil wars, the population reached 971,397 in 1930. Therefore, when the Land Regulations were revised in 1854, this new situation of Chinese people moving to the concession was taken into consideration. The principle that the concession should not be a place of residence for Chinese people had become difficult in reality. However, the principle that citizens should pay taxes must be firmly maintained. Therefore, in the notice issued by Lan Weiwen, the Defense Commissioner of Jiangsu-Songjiang-Taicang on February 24, 1855, allowing Chinese people to reside in the concession, it was stated that "all Chinese people within the concession --- should abide by the newly established regulations and pay taxes according to the rules." The phrase "abide by the newly established regulations" refers to the Land Regulations revised in 1854. The phrase "pay taxes according to the rules" refers to paying taxes to the concession authorities according to the provisions of the regulations. This is the origin of the plaintiff's collection of taxes from Chinese people. Perhaps the defendant, formerly a British subject, did not pay attention to this history, or perhaps it is because he has recently regained his Chinese nationality and therefore regards it as a new or strange event.</p>
<p>The defendant claimed that "it is a universally recognized principle that taxpayers have the right to vote and to understand the collection and expenditure of taxes." The Municipal Council has monthly and annual reports detailing how taxes are collected and spent. All major Chinese and Western newspapers in Shanghai also report on this in detail. Even for the 239.40 yuan in municipal taxes that the defendant refused to pay, they did not dare to give up, lest the burden on other taxpayers be increased. Therefore, not only has the plaintiff filed a lawsuit in court to seek a way to collect the taxes, but it has also already planned how to spend the funds after they are collected. As for the taxpayer's right to vote, it is an inherent theory. Otherwise, where would the five Chinese directors and Chinese committee members of the Municipal Council come from? The plaintiff dares to reiterate that all Chinese taxpayers and Western taxpayers within the Public Concession enjoy the same voting rights and other rights that citizens should enjoy, without any distinction in status or significance. Perhaps the defendant, having recently regained his Chinese nationality, does not understand the rights that Chinese citizens in the concession should enjoy and therefore believes that the right of Chinese people to vote is an unbelievable or impossible experience. As a result, he ignores the facts, disregards the Chinese directors and Chinese committee members who are legally elected by our Chinese taxpayers, and simply uses a slogan, saying that the voting rights of our Chinese taxpayers have been almost completely deprived by Westerners. For the defendant's sake, he should first pay the full amount of the municipal general taxes that he owes to gain the status of a taxpayer. Then, not only would the defendant have a seat in the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, enjoying the rights that he should have without being subject to the whims of others, but he could also be elected as a Chinese director or Chinese committee member, benefiting all citizens, which would be a matter of course.</p>
<p>The defendant claimed that "the reason for not paying property tax is that he cannot obtain voting rights at the annual meeting of taxpayers, while Westerners of equal tax status can attend the election." The fact that Chinese taxpayers have a Chinese Taxpayers' Association and that the five Chinese directors and Chinese committee members elected by the association jointly exercise their powers with the British, American, and Japanese directors of the Municipal Council is undeniable. Historically, the original Public Concession was established for foreign residents only and was not a place for Chinese people to argue for their rights. After much effort and many twists and turns, our Chinese taxpayers have also won five seats on the board of directors, the same number as the United Kingdom and three more than the United States and Japan. The efforts of our predecessors have enabled later generations to enjoy the benefits. Western taxpayers have the right to attend the annual meeting, which is their inherent right, while it is a position that our Chinese taxpayers have not yet achieved in practice. However, the reason why we must pay taxes is that we already reside in the concession and have no ambition to move out of the concession because we are unwilling to pay taxes. In the past, Defense Commissioner Lan Weiwen's notice stated that Chinese people paying taxes according to the regulations was a necessary condition for residing in the concession. Since there are five Chinese directors on the board of directors, all the civil rights enjoyed by Western taxpayers, except for attending the annual meeting, are also enjoyed by Chinese taxpayers. As for the treaty itself, it is a product of special circumstances, belonging to politics and diplomacy, not to the scope of the judiciary. Its shortcomings can be used by patriotic people as material for speeches to move their listeners, but judges and lawyers cannot use it as a reason for debate or judgment. Therefore, to change the facts and specially grant the defendant the right to attend the annual meeting is impossible.</p>
<p>The defendant claimed that "the plaintiff's discriminatory attitude is unfair" and is unwilling to pay the tax. It is not clear what discriminatory attitude he is referring to, but it probably refers to the fifth point mentioned above. If so, then it is repetitive. The defendant has the ambition to list ten reasons, but in fact, he has difficulty finding ten reasons. Therefore, he has no choice but to repeat the same reason in several ways to make up the number. Although the action is foolish, the intention is commendable. However, the plaintiff believes that it has already explained the matter clearly in the above paragraphs and that there is no need to repeat the arguments and engage in meaningless discussion.</p>
<p>The defendant claimed that "according to what law does the Municipal Council only allow Westerners to vote and exclude Chinese people from enjoying the same rights?" The defendant, formerly a British subject, should know the basis on which he voted in the past. Now, having recently regained his Chinese nationality, he may not be aware of the establishment of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the concession, nor of the fact that Chinese taxpayers currently vote to elect Chinese directors and Chinese committee members. The plaintiff believes that this seventh reason is the same as the fourth reason mentioned above, and it is an unfounded rumor that does not conform to the facts.</p>
<p>The defendant claimed that "the Qing government did not grant the Shanghai Public Concession the right to collect taxes from Chinese people." Regarding this point, it is the same as the second reason mentioned above. We will ignore the notice issued by Lan Daotai on February 24, 1855, and ignore the history of Chinese people voluntarily paying taxes to reside in the concession when they moved to the concession. There are thousands upon thousands of confirmed judicial precedents. There is no doubt that the Municipal Council has the right to collect municipal taxes from the defendant.</p>
<p>The defendant claimed that "a property tax of 14% is too high, illegal, and has not been agreed to by the defendant." The defendant's initial claim was that the Municipal Council has no right to collect taxes from him. Later, he claimed that the property tax of 14% is too high. Is the defendant refusing to pay municipal taxes because he believes he should not pay them, or because he believes the tax rate of 14% is too high and is unwilling to pay? He is inconsistent in his claims, making it impossible to understand him. If he believes that 14% is too high, then what is the reason why it is too high, what is the way to reduce it, and what percentage should it be to be considered legal and to obtain the defendant's agreement? Furthermore, have the various taxes in the Chinese area ever been agreed to by the defendant? Have the methods of collection ever gone through the procedures of the judicial organs?</p>
<p>The defendant claimed that "if he can obtain the right to vote, he is willing to pay fair and reasonable taxes." The fact that Chinese taxpayers have the right to vote was obtained by our predecessors through diplomatic and political means, and it is not necessary for the defendant to make further efforts in court to obtain this right that has already been obtained and enjoyed for eighty or ninety years. The "right to vote" that the defendant is referring to is probably confusing it with "attending the annual meeting." The right to vote and attending the annual meeting are two separate matters and are not related to each other. Chinese taxpayers already have the right to vote but cannot "attend the annual meeting." Even the Municipal Council itself cannot change this situation in the slightest. The defendant should submit a statement to the National Government, asking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to propose a fair and reasonable solution to the treaty countries. Otherwise, discussing diplomacy and politics in court is inappropriate. According to the treaty, the law, custom, and facts, the plaintiff has the right to collect municipal general taxes from the defendant, and the defendant's refusal to pay the tax is completely unreasonable. It is requested that the court order him to pay the full amount and bear the litigation costs. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, December 16, 24th year, by the Shanghai Municipal Council, represented by attorney Ru Bao Yi.</p>
<h3>Aid Wang Association: Approved by Ministry Yesterday, Meeting to be Held Soon</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Aid Wang Binyan Due to Official Hardship Council, in order to request the Ministry of Finance to return the local advance funds to repay debts, had repeatedly sent representatives to local coordination associations and other organizations to petition, but no results had been achieved.

<h3>Lixue Association: Receives Telegrams from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior</h3>
<p>The Lixue United Association received a telegram from the Executive Yuan of the National Government, stating: "To Mr. Zhang Yichen of the Lixue United Association: Your telegram has been received.

<h3>Shanghai-Mogan Mountain Joint Transportation Bus Service Temporarily Changed to Once Daily Round Trip from December 25th to January 5th of the 25th Year</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, considering the increased number of Chinese and foreign tourists visiting Mogan Mountain during the Winter Solstice and New Year holidays to enjoy the winter scenery, has reached an agreement with the Zhejiang Highway Bureau to implement joint transportation between Shanghai and Mogan Mountain. From December 25th to January 5th of the following year, for these twelve days, the joint transportation bus service between Shanghai and Mogan Mountain will be temporarily changed to one round trip per day. The 10th and 34th buses will be used for this joint transportation to facilitate travelers.</p>
<p>The Zhabei Charity Organization, due to the severe flooding in various provinces this year, leading to agricultural devastation and a large number of impoverished victims fleeing to Shanghai, and considering the approaching harsh winter where these impoverished people struggle to obtain food and clothing, finds the situation deeply concerning. Furthermore, due to the economic downturn, most large and small factories in Zhabei have suspended operations, adding unemployed workers to the disaster victims. Therefore, starting a porridge distribution service is deemed urgent. The funds for the service will come from donations from board members, allocations from the municipal government, and public fundraising. The porridge distribution site will remain at the original location of the Second Porridge Distribution Center on Liuying Road. A reed mat shed has been constructed and completed, capable of accommodating over 15,000 people. Thirty-some piculs of rice will be needed daily, totaling over 2,000 piculs for two months. The porridge distribution will start tomorrow (the 28th), from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM daily. Adults will receive three ladles of porridge each, and children will receive two ladles each. Impoverished people can go and receive porridge at any time within the specified hours. Yesterday's report stating that the center had already opened was a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>### Jiangsu Province Coal Gas Vehicle Test Postponed to New Year's Day Next Year Change of Plan: Zhongming No Longer Participating</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Administration, in order to promote the coal gas vehicle industry, submitted a request to the Construction Department to have Zhongming, China, and Zhonghua companies install a total of six Da Mengtian passenger buses. The test run was scheduled for yesterday on the Xihu Road, Xicheng Road, and Zhencheng Road. It has been learned that Shen Qirong, the director of the Administration, has postponed the test run to New Year's Day next year due to insufficient preparation and has extended the test run period to one month. All companies have been notified to comply. However, it is reported that Zhongming Company has undertaken a significant number of contracts to install wood charcoal-fueled oil substitute furnaces on passenger buses for various highways, making it unable to cope. They have replied to the Administration, deciding not to participate.</p>
<h3>### Baoshan Meat Industry Market Strike Case Second Mediation Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>The fresh pork industry in various towns in Baoshan County, previously reported to have caused a market strike due to objections to the high slaughter tax rate, has been covered in the newspapers. It is now learned that the county party headquarters convened a mediation between the two parties, but it was unsuccessful. However, to maintain the market, it was decided to persuade the meat merchants to resume business first, pending further sincere mediation with the county government. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Zhu Xuedian, a member of the county party headquarters, and Wang Lanting, the section chief of the second section of the county government, convened a meeting at the county party headquarters. Wang Jin, the director of the slaughter tax certificate collection, and Liu Shouzhu, Tan Runsheng, and other representatives of meat merchants from the entire county, totaling over twenty people, attended the meeting. After formal greetings, negotiations began. However, due to the significant difference in opinions between the two parties, no resolution has yet been reached.</p>
<h3>### Domestically Produced Glacial Acetic Acid and Wood Spirit to Appear Essential for Manufacturing Industry, Saving 3 Million Annually</h3>
<p>Glacial acetic acid, wood spirit, calcium acetate, and other chemical raw materials essential for the manufacturing industry, have been reliant on imports from Japan and Germany, resulting in an outflow of two to three million yuan annually. Now, Xue Jimin, a chemistry Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in the United States, and others have invested in establishing the Jiangnan Chemical Industry Manufacturing Plant. Xue himself will serve as the chief engineer. The plant will exclusively use persimmon trees produced in Sichuan and Guangdong to produce glacial acetic acid, wood spirit, calcium acetate, tar, and other products, all obtained by dry distillation. In addition, charcoal is also a major product. The plant is scheduled to officially open on New Year's Day next year, and shipments are expected to begin in January. According to an interview with Xue Jimin, the chief engineer of the plant, conducted by a reporter from the Datong News Agency, all the machinery in the plant is of the German Meyer type. The daily output is projected to be 3,000 pounds of glacial acetic acid, 600 pounds of wood spirit, one ton of tar, and 150 dans of charcoal, roughly meeting one-third of the needs of the local industrial sector. The persimmon trees are abundant in Sichuan and other parts of China, and future improvements and increased production will be sufficient to recover significant foreign exchange losses.</p>
<h3>### Zhang Gao's Invention of Heat Intensifier A Good News Amidst National Crisis</h3>
<p>Zhang Gaomo, a native of Ningbo and younger brother of Zhang Daoyuan, has recently invented a "Heat Intensifier" through years of research.

<h3>### Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor of the Central News Agency,</p>
<p>Today's edition of your newspaper reported that students from our school were stranded in Kunshan, which is not true. After investigation, our school has no students stranded in Kunshan. Please correct this.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Guangxia Middle School</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper about the assassination of Tang Youren, which stated that he was rushed to the Guangci Hospital, but the hospital refused to admit him because no police officers accompanied him. He was then transferred to the Lujiawan General Police Station. At this time, Mr. Tang only gave a final glance before dying from his injuries. This is not true.</p>
<p>When the deceased arrived at the hospital, Dr. Cheng of our hospital examined him in detail and determined that he had already died from his injuries. He was then transferred to the French Concession autopsy center. Based on this situation, it is clear that our hospital did not refuse to admit him. We are writing to inform you of this matter and request that you make a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Guangci Hospital</p>
<p>December 26, 1935</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper about the fire at the Dunlop Warehouse, which contained many inaccuracies. The fourth floor of the warehouse is rented by our company and is used to store grey, yellow, and white silk, various silk waste, and cow and sheepskins. It is not the fifth floor, nor is it Yifengchang. The goods stored in our warehouse are not flammable, and fire rises, not falls. It is easy to see which floor the fire started on. Your newspaper's report is inconsistent with the facts. Please publish a correction in the correction column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>"No Guts, No Glory": Lianghua Takes on Pirates Tonight at 8:30 PM at West Qing Ming Night at Shen Garden Eagerly Awaiting Lianghua to Avenge Their Past Shame</h3>
<p>The Lianghua basketball team has arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin, winning two out of two games. Their biggest desire is to avenge their shame of losing to the Pirates two years ago. It was initially decided to hold a game at Shen Garden, but the Pirates insisted that the final decision be made at the West Qing Basketball Gym. It was decided to hold one game each at Shen Garden and West Qing, with the Pirates insisting on the first game at West Qing. Therefore, it is scheduled for tonight at 8:30 PM at West Qing. Since the West Qing court is small and familiar to the Pirates, the Lianghua players must be careful. It is hoped that they can win decisively and avenge their hatred. Tang Baokun is scheduled to arrive from Beijing today. West Qing tickets are divided into one yuan and five jiao. Student tickets and discount tickets are not valid. Tonight's game between Xie Xing and Youyou has been postponed. Referees are Zhang Guoxun and Hu Na'er.</p>

<h3>### Tiecheng Cup Basketball Tournament: Chi Zhi Loses to East Asia</h3>
<p>Two-Point Difference: Chi Zhi Suffers a Miserable Defeat Major Conflict Between Players from Both Teams</p>
<p>In yesterday evening's Group A game of the Tiecheng Cup Basketball Tournament, Chi Zhi faced East Asia. The competition between the two teams was fierce. Chi Zhi had a smooth first half, leading 21 to 13. In the second half, three players from Chi Zhi, Liang Yunming, Zhou Cheng, and Chen Xuechong, were penalized and ejected from the game for four fouls each. East Asia caught up and surpassed them in the end, winning by two points. East Asia defeated Chi Zhi with a score of 37 to 35.</p>
<p>After East Asia's loss, they believed that the scorekeeper had made a mistake, leading to a dispute. They snatched the scorebook and tore it up. In the locker room, the players clashed. Fortunately, the referee had already escaped and was not affected. Hu Zongfan from the Education Bureau (appointed as the sports stadium manager) came to mediate but was also insulted, and his clothes were damaged. The police officers from the Public Security Bureau arrived to suppress the situation before it dispersed. Regardless of who is right or wrong in this unfortunate incident, resorting to violence is not a normal way to resolve it. The coaches of both teams, Jiang Lianggui and Wang Fudan, are members of the Tiecheng Cup Basketball Tournament Organizing Committee and also members of the Municipal Sports Association, so they should be able to handle the aftermath properly. (It is noted that the referee for the game was originally Zhang Wenyu, but he did not arrive, so Chen Zhenhua served as the referee temporarily. His enforcement of the rules seemed excessive at times, causing resentment, which was also a reason for the dispute.)</p>

<p>Educational News from Anhui Province</p>
<p>Implementation of Preliminary Compulsory Education Measures</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government has formulated "Measures for the Implementation of Preliminary Compulsory Education, Compulsory Enrollment, Delayed Enrollment, and Exemption from School Fees in Anhui Province." It has consulted with the Ministry of Education for record-keeping and has been instructed by the Anhui Provincial Government to the county governments of the 61 counties in Anhui Province, which in turn ordered their affiliated educational administrative organs, district offices, and elementary schools to be informed. The measures for the implementation of preliminary compulsory education, compulsory enrollment, delayed enrollment, and exemption from school fees in Anhui Province are as follows:</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in the provincial capital, the compulsory enrollment, delayed enrollment, and exemption from school fees for preliminary compulsory education in this province shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these measures.</p>
<p>During the period of implementation of preliminary compulsory education, all out-of-school children in the province aged nine to fourteen (inclusive) shall complete at least one year of compulsory education. Otherwise, the school board and the joint guarantee director shall enforce it.</p>
<p>Compulsory enrollment shall be based on the distance from the school. All children aged nine to ten within three *li* of the school shall be compulsorily enrolled, and all children aged eleven to twelve within five *li* shall be compulsorily enrolled. However, if local ordinary elementary schools or short-term elementary schools cannot accommodate them, children of older school age shall be compulsorily enrolled first.</p>
<p>Within two months of the start of the school year, the school board and the joint guarantee director of each district shall investigate and clarify the children in the district who should be enrolled, delayed, or exempted from school fees, and prepare three copies of the list. One copy shall be submitted to the district, one copy shall be forwarded by the district to the county, and one copy shall be kept in the school. At the same time, the parents, guardians, or employers of the children shall be notified to send the children who should be enrolled to school.</p>
<p>If a child who should be enrolled fails to register or attend school without reason within one week after the start of school, the school board and the joint guarantee director shall advise the parents, guardians, or employers. Those who do not comply shall be warned. If they still do not comply three days after the warning, they shall be fined one *jiao* or sentenced to half a day of labor, and shall still be ordered to enroll. The fines shall be registered and kept by the school board and the joint guarantee director for the purpose of running welfare education.</p>
<p>The leave period for enrolled children shall be a maximum of three weeks per semester, and missing lessons shall be made up. Otherwise, the length of compulsory education shall be extended. Those who are absent from school without reason for three days shall be advised to their parents, guardians, or employers. Those who do not comply shall be warned. If they still do not come three days later, they shall be fined one *jiao* or sentenced to half a day of labor, and shall still be ordered to enroll.</p>
<p>If school-age children have illnesses or other reasons that temporarily prevent them from attending school, their parents, guardians, or employers may submit a pledge requesting delayed enrollment. However, if local ordinary elementary schools or short-term elementary schools cannot accommodate all school-age children, children of younger school age may be ordered to delay enrollment. In all cases, the school board and the joint guarantee director shall, together with the parents, guardians, or employers of the children, predetermine the period for supplementary enrollment.</p>
<p>School-age children who have chronic diseases that make them unable to receive education may be exempted from school fees if their parents or guardians submit a pledge and the school board and the joint guarantee director verify that it is true.</p>
<p>During the period of implementation of preliminary compulsory education, school-age children who have received one year of short-term elementary school education shall be deemed to have completed their compulsory education. Those who have studied in ordinary elementary schools for two years shall be considered to have received compulsory education. Those who have received education equivalent to compulsory education in private schools or at home, or who have received itinerant teaching or teacher training and have passed the examination by the designated authority and been issued a certificate, shall also be considered to have received compulsory education.</p>
<p>These measures shall be promulgated and implemented by the provincial government and shall be submitted to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping.</p>
<p>This Semester's Education Research Work Will Conclude Soon</p>
<p>The results are very satisfactory and will be reported separately in daily reports.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented harvest for educational research in this city.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Education Bureau of this city, has always attached great importance to the research work of educational personnel in the city. Since the change of the supervision plan this year, he has spared no effort in promoting and encouraging it. Now that the first semester of this year is about to end, the achievements of the educational research institutes at all levels are very fruitful. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency specially explored and recorded the various situations as follows:</p>
<p>Elementary Education Research Association</p>
<p>Starting this year, the city has been divided into 22 districts. The dates and locations of the meetings in each district are determined by the Education Bureau in a comprehensive manner, and personnel are sent to each district to provide guidance. The research problems are also collected from the schools by the Education Bureau in advance and then distributed for research, so they are all relevant to the actual situation. Now the second major meetings in each district have ended one after another, and the research results have been submitted to the Education Bureau. The number of words is nearly one million, which is an unprecedented harvest for educational research in this city. It is now being rectified, and a city-wide research conference can be scheduled soon, which will be presided over by Director Pan himself.</p>
<p>Short-Term Elementary and Research Association</p>
<p>This association was newly established this year. All faculty and staff of short-term elementary schools and short-term elementary school classes attached to various schools in the city must participate. Two meetings have been held this year, and the research results are also very satisfactory. It is now being reviewed and sorted out by Wan Zhu and other schools. Once it is submitted to the bureau for review, it can be compiled and printed into a report for reference by the short-term elementary school community across the country.</p>
<p>Secondary School Normal School Education and Research Association</p>
<p>This association was established last year. The participants are principals of public and private secondary schools and normal schools in the city. The research spirit is very full. After the first general meeting this year, the research problems were divided into groups for research, and more than a dozen meetings were held. The basic content of the prescribed problems has been resolved. Once the reports from each group are submitted to the bureau, the second general meeting will be convened, which will also be chaired by Director Pan, it is said.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel, Little Men (136)</p>
<p>Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"Marmee, let me go now; next time my great behavior will be very clever, and I will certainly not be stupid, I dare say," said Rob, as the dinner bell rang, and Tandy came to look at him, feeling surprised, but also with deep sympathy.</p>
<p>"We'll see," said his mother, and released him. He hurried across the hall, past the dining room, and stopped at Nan's side, his face radiant, as if he had won another spiritual victory.</p>
<p>"May I get lunch for her, will you let me?" he asked, feeling sorry for his fellow prisoner.</p>
<p>"To be able to take care of others, that's my little son! Yes, pull out that table, bring over a chair;" Mrs. Shu said, and hurried out to quiet the eager demands of the other children, who were always almost rowdy with hunger at noon.</p>
<p>Nan ate his lunch alone, and spent the long afternoon bound to Suva's feet alone. However, Mrs. Pei had lengthened the rope, allowing her to look out the window; so she stood watching the children playing, and many little summer animals enjoying their freedom, and Xiao Mei took Nannan to the meadow for a "suburban narrative," so that Nan, though unable to participate in person, could see the fun. Tao Mo did a few great somersaults to comfort her; Xiao Qiao sat on the steps, reading aloud as loud as he could for Nan to hear.</p>

<p>Commercial News and Finance</p>
<p>Extremely Sluggish Financial Market</p>
<p>Yesterday's financial market remained calm. The market situation was extremely sluggish due to the fact that foreign banks were not yet open. The foreign exchange rate remained unchanged, the same as the previous day in the morning and afternoon, still opening at one *jiao*. The volume of bill discounting transactions was over 3.2 million in the morning, over 300,000 in new transactions, over 200,000 in the afternoon, over 600,000 in the Small General Association, over 1.6 million in banknotes issued, and over 600,000 in other places. Chinese banks received and resolved over 2.5 million in bills, over 3.5 million in various freight, remittance, tax, and miscellaneous payments, over 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 700,000 in special remittances. Private money houses received and resolved over 57 million in bills, over 800,000 in various remittances. In subsidiary coin transactions, Guangdong small silver coins were traded at 15,000 *jiao* in the morning, with the black market price still at 11 *jiao* 3.8 *li*. 34,500 strings of copper coins were traded, and 11,500 yuan in legal tender. In addition, the total number of bills in the Clearing House was 21,186,380 yuan 5.4 *jiao*, including a total of 14,518,935 yuan 4.2 *jiao* in exchanged bills, and a total of 3.7 million plus 8,292 yuan plus 8 *fen* collected on behalf of the Money Trade, and 2,959,153 yuan plus 4 *fen* collected on behalf of others.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn Merchants Inclined to Sell Off</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the situation was flat. The industry was unanimously inclined to sell off. The yarn inventory in the yarn and cloth warehouses increased to over 18,000 bales. However, the banking and gold industries, as well as government bond dealers, were bullish on prices after the announcement of the legal tender and were dragging in unilaterally, showing that the competition between the bulls and bears was fierce.</p>
<p>Da Ji's Short Position Increases</p>
<p>At the opening of the benchmark yarn market in the morning, market sentiment was depressed. It was expected that the benchmark price would be small tomorrow, and the industry was unilaterally selling off, resulting in a slightly looser front. Da Ji's short position increased, and Geng Feng's long position closed out. However, Chang Feng's long position made efforts to purchase, and the inventory has reached over 12,000 bales. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 9 *jiao* to 1.3 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, to 46 yuan. At the opening in the afternoon, it continued to fall by 2-3 *jiao*. It was also heard that there were not many spot yarn transactions. However, Chang Feng still dragged in a large amount, and the second and third discs turned upward. As a result, the prices for each month were uneven, rising and falling by 1.3 *jiao*. It was found that Da Ji sold 2,100 bales, He Xing 800 bales, Geng Feng 1,600 bales, Xin Cheng 2,400 bales, Da Feng 350 bales, and Shen Ji 750 bales. Yu Kang bought 550 bales, Yi Da 500 bales, Yuan Da 350 bales, Yi Da 900 bales, Yi Chang 500 bales, Chang Feng 3,200 bales, and Jin Kang 450 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Only 400 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still weak. It was found that the total amount of yarn bought by various syndicates throughout the day was 404 bales, and the price fell slightly by 5 *jiao*. The amount of purchases by various syndicates is as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland: 190, Guangdong: 12, Shantou: 42</p>
<p>Industry: 15, Wuhu: 10, Ningbo: 5</p>
<p>Nanjing: 10, Yunnan: 40, Changsha: 80</p>
<p>Few Buyers in the Benchmark Cotton Market</p>
<p>The cotton market was depressed due to the flat overseas cotton market and the continued shrinking of silver. The current cotton sales market was not smooth. Although the goods received last month were enthusiastic, they were all accepted by arbitrageurs, and people's hearts were tired. However, the prices in various producing areas were difficult to loosen, and the sources were gradually withering.</p>
<p>Sen Kang Came to Sell Short Again</p>
<p>At the opening of the benchmark cotton market in the morning, people's hearts were dark due to the fall in cotton futures by 1.5 to 2.5 Robbie, and the mixed rise and fall of American cotton. Most of the targets were bearish on the gold market tomorrow, and there was a lack of buyers. Sen Kang came to sell short again, and Yuan Yi's long position closed out. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 2.5 to 3.4 *jiao* compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the opening in the afternoon, it was flat, and it returned to its original state after the auction at the closing. As a result, the price of the near-month contract rose by 5 *fen* to 1 *jiao* compared to the closing price in the morning, while the price of the far-month contract did not move. It was found that Da Ji sold 2,400 dan, Da Feng 1,200 dan, Tong Ji 1,100 dan, He Xing 1,500 dan, Sen Kang 5,100 dan, Yuan Yi 5,300 dan, Yi Chang 2,700 dan, Heng Chang 1,300 dan, Shen Ji 1,700 dan, and Xin Cheng 3,700 dan. He Xing bought 1,400 dan, Da Fu 2,600 dan, Tong Ji 3,100 dan, Yuan Da 1,000 dan, Tai Chang 1,300 dan, Yong Da 1,300 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 2,400 dan, Run Kang 1,300 dan, Yi Kang 2,800 dan, and Rui Yuan 1,600 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Demand Is Not Bad</p>
<p>The current cotton consumption can still be maintained. The arrival of Yao cotton at the dock was 820 bales, and the arrival of Tong cotton was 305 bales.</p>
<p>The Yarn Inventory in the Yarn and Cloth Warehouse Has Increased Sharply</p>
<p>The total amount of yarn stored in the Intention Stock Exchange of this city as of December 26 was 18,865 bales. Among them, 2,200 bales were of 20-count Jincheng, 1,950 bales were of Bianma, 1,900 bales were of Kuixing, 1,110 bales were of Tianguan, 1,630 bales were of Jinji, and 1,100 bales were of Dafa. These six items were the most. The general shorts used this large amount of chips to force sales. Due to the reform of the legal currency, the financial community was bullish, and the bulls and bears were competing fiercely. The yarn counts, yarn names, and amounts are listed below.</p>
<p>Grain</p>
<p>Hedging Activities in the Futures Flour Market Are Particularly Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a state of initial fatigue followed by continuation. The prices of foreign wheat were Chicago close to good at 2 *jiao*, far small at 4 *fen* to 1 *jiao* and Canadian small at 4 *fen* to 1 *jiao*. At the opening in the morning, due to the approaching year-end, the industry and outsiders were preparing to close their transactions. Outsiders were mostly closing out very smoothly. The prices for each month were about 1 *fen* lower than the closing price on Tuesday. Later, due to the filling of floating shorts and the fact that the factories did not sell off, hedging in the January and February contracts was also active, so the market sentiment rose again. At the opening in the afternoon, the transactions were not very smooth. The buyers and sellers were mostly closing out. However, the factories were hedging themselves in the current month, and hedging in the long-term contracts was still quite frequent. The Northern Route customer syndicate also slightly absorbed some, so the market sentiment recovered and held steady, which was 1-2 *fen* higher than on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Price of Wheat Rose After the Far-Month Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was characterized by flat and rising prices for the morning and afternoon openings. The prices in the current month were always flat because the delivery was approaching and the delivery at the end of the month was heard. The prices in the far-month contracts did not fluctuate much in the morning, but in the afternoon, due to the revival of the flour market, the chips from the sellers in the market were very scarce, so the asking prices were strong, which was 5-6 *fen* higher than on Tuesday. Considering that there are only a few days left in the year, if there are no special changes abroad, it should be able to pass smoothly.</p>
<p>The Price of Basmati Rice Handled by Benjie Rose Suddenly by 1-2 *jiao*</p>
<p>Yesterday's Basmati rice market was characterized by active arrivals and sales, and the market sentiment was very strong. The appetite of Benjie was extremely greedy, and the prices of each grade rose across the board. In particular, the goods from Zhongguan were welcomed by Benjie, and the price soared by as much as 1.5 to 2 *jiao*. High-grade goods rose by nearly *jiao*, and low-grade goods followed by 6-7 *fen*. A total of 8,681 bags of Gan rice, 4,700 bags of Wen Tai rice, 626 bags of Yong Shao rice, 960 bags of Shashi rice, 700 bags of Min rice, and 436 bags of Yue rice were opened throughout the day, totaling more than 76,000 bags, all of which were handled by a syndicate in Benjie.</p>
<p>The Arrival of Food Rice Was Scarce and Tight</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the arrival of goods from various syndicates was only about 30 numbers (a total of more than 6,000 *shi*), and the sales market in Benjie was not as smooth as the previous day. The bag appetite was only more than 2,000 bags. The thick early japonica rice only relied on scarcity to add 5 *fen*, the thin indica rice went down slightly by 6 *fen*, Du Yang Jian had no honor or disgrace, and the shadow change was similar to the original.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the arrival of goods from various routes in Hexia was scarce, about 34-5 numbers. The white japonica rice shop appetite in the market continued to melt, and the hoarders continued to handle it, and it was also tight. The early rice followed closely by nearly *jiao*, the thin rice was still good for retail, and the price was tight by several *fen*. Yangbu Jian was slightly tight, Bai Yuan arrived at the head of Liuliu, and the retail dismantling was normal. The market price was tight, the customer tips were dull, and the prices of other goods also showed an increase.</p>
<p>Factory Demand Was Active, and Yellow Beans Rose</p>
<p>The yellow bean market was active because the arrivals and inventory were both scarce, and two oil mills, Changde and Dayou, were interested in them. The market sentiment was active, and the prices rose and fell by 2-3 *fen* in the morning and afternoon. Transactions included 3,000 bags of Xinyang Zhou beans, 700 bags of Zhengcheng beans, 600 bags of Zhumadian beans, 600 bags of Guide beans, and 300 bags of Dangshan beans. The price of foreign sesame seeds was still between 12 yuan. At present, the appetite of foreign firms was not large, and there were few large households selling them, so the market was stable.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<p>Tea Inventory Was More Than 12,900 Boxes</p>
<p>The number of red and green teas shipped by foreign firms in this city this year, Keng, from Shanghai to other ports for sales, totaled more than 450,000 boxes. In the late summer and early autumn, the sales were quite rapid due to the low market prices. Now that the year-end has arrived, the inventory at the bottom is thin. It was found that the inventory of black tea was only 568 boxes, the inventory of Luzhuang green tea was 3,700 boxes, the inventory of Pingshui green tea was 3,300 boxes, and the inventory of Tuzhuang green tea was 5,400 boxes, totaling only 12,900 boxes.</p>
<p>Metals</p>
<p>Italian Tinplate Will No Longer Arrive</p>
<p>Sales Are Still Strong</p>
<p>In recent days, the Jinling Arsenal, toy factories, and machine factories have all purchased a large amount of thick tinplate. The price per box is two to three times higher than before. The other day, the Huashun Wharf and Gong Hexiang both had spot goods arriving, but sales were still strong. It was heard that the number of boxes opened yesterday was still as high as 6,000-7,000 boxes. The price of 24-gauge Italian goods per box (30 inches by 36 inches, 50 sheets) was estimated at 300 yuan, and the price of 26-gauge Italian goods (same size and number of sheets as above) was estimated at 190 yuan. The price of 24-gauge German goods (21 inches by 30 inches, 56 sheets per box) was estimated at 100 yuan per box. Due to the sanctions, goods from Italy can no longer come to Shanghai. The only goods circulating on the market from now on are German goods.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<p>Red Cloth and White Yarn Are Bidding Up</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 2,972nd Thursday auction of the Yuanhua Foreign Firm. Six boxes of Yuan Tai western satin, two boxes of Yuan velvet, one box of Zhigong wool, 48 boxes of Yuan feather silk, and boxes of foreign blue cloth were displayed. Compared to last week, one box of Buddha's hand foreign bamboo cloth was added, as well as one box of vivid white yarn. The market situation was that the prices of various brands of western satin rose by 2-3 *fen*, the Yuan velvet Gong wool was flat, and the prices of feather silk rose mostly. The prices of Wei Luan Feng Yan brand fell by nearly 1 yuan. There was a shortage of foreign red cloth and white yarn in the market, and foreign cloth merchants were bidding up the prices.</p>
<p>Coats Were Selling Well, and Lining Materials Were in Short Supply and Rising</p>
<p>The retail transactions of wool fabrics were still frequent. The goods could not be shipped because the customs were closed. Most of the transactions were in cash. The market sentiment in the Guild was still strong. The prices of lining materials such as French lining, patterned foreign cloth, black charcoal lining, horsehair satin, silk-like feather yarn, and twill feather yarn were all rising sharply. In particular, French lining was particularly expensive due to the shortage of goods. The Shanghai market for various foreign goods seemed to be running out of stock. Although the Hongsheng national goods woven in Shanghai were being processed day and night, the supply was still insufficient to meet the demand. Now is the peak season for coat sales, so the situation is even more intense. The price of silk-like feather yarn was also likely to rise again due to the raw materials of rayon.</p>

<p>The Tea Industry in China (1)</p>
<p>By Zhang Yibai</p>
<p>A Brief History of Tea and the Importance of Its Status in China</p>
<p>Tea is a unique product of China. Its history is very long. In ancient times, it was called bitter tea. It was also known as *jia* or *chuan*. According to the *Compendium of Materia Medica*, "Shen Nong tasted hundreds of herbs, and encountered seventy poisons in one day, and tea was obtained to detoxify them." It can be seen that tea was discovered by China 5,000 years ago. During the Western Han Dynasty, tea drinking was prevalent in Sichuan. After the Wei and Jin Dynasties, the tea drinking custom gradually spread to the Yangtze River basin. By the Tang Dynasty, it swept the country. At that time, Xiang tea was listed as one of the tributes. In the Tang Dynasty, there was a man named Lu Yu, who wrote a special collection on tea, called *The Classic of Tea*. According to the *Tang Book*, "Yu loved tea and wrote three chapters on the origin, method, and utensils of tea." Therefore, those who sold tea later revered him as the "God of Tea." From this, it can be seen that tea has a long history in China. Moreover, tea was not only a necessity in the national economic life in the Tang Dynasty, but also an important source of revenue for the government. See the *Tang Book Biography of Wang Ya*: "Ya paid Sikong, and began to change the tea law, increasing its tax to help the use." See also the *Song Book Food and Goods Chronicle*: "Since the Jianzhong period of the Tang Dynasty, there has been a tea law, and the upper and lower levels have been regulated for profit for nearly two hundred years." Therefore, tea had completely become a commodity in the Tang Dynasty. By the Song Dynasty, the government implemented a controlled tea industry. In the fourth year of Xining, Zhang Dun overcame, Hunan Meishan, and placed Huaxian, and set up tea fields. Every spring, those who picked and made tea were endlessly on the road, and the government set up special officials to guard them. After Xining, tea and horse divisions were set up in the border areas to control the export of Chinese tea to Mongolia, Tibet, and Qinghai. Therefore, China's tea industry was quite developed in 1070 AD. (That is, 855 years from now). At that time, there was the so-called "tea horse policy," that is, since Xining of the Song Dynasty, tea and horse divisions were set up in the border areas such as Mongolia and Tibet. The task of this tea and horse division was to handle the exchange of Chinese tea with horses from outside the Great Wall. Therefore, the examiner once believed that this tea horse policy was closely related to the dissemination of Han culture, the development of economic, political, and military affairs. By the Yuan Dynasty, the production of tea reached more than 40 million catties.</p>
<p>By the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty (in 1540 AD, European merchants sailed to Guangdong and brought tea seeds back). This was the beginning of the flow of Chinese tea to Europe. At the same time, it was also the time when Europe and India began to plant tea. This natural tea product, uniquely endowed to China, became a product available all over the world in less than a few decades. By today, the latecomers have surpassed the former, and China, the ancestral home of tea production, has been gradually declining under the oppression of emerging India, Ceylon, Japan, Java, and other countries! This point will be discussed in detail later.</p>
<p>The formal trade of Chinese tea with Europe began in the early Qing Dynasty. In 1664 (during the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty), a manager of the British East India Company brought tea back to the British Emperor from China. In 1666, the Dutch brought tea to England. Therefore, in 1678, the East India Company officially selected and purchased Chinese tea for shipment to Europe, and the quantity reached 4,713 pounds. This was the beginning of the export of Chinese tea to Europe. This was during the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty for more than 20 years. In the 1</p>
<h3>Chinese Track and Field Team Cross-Country Race</h3>
