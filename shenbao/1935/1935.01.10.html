<h3 id="c34">法意協定成立後之歐局恒 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>賴伐爾抵羅馬。甫及二日。外電傳來。法意恊定。已告成立。此其奏功之迅速。殊足令人驚訝。雖然。法意之欲求携手。爲時已久。蓋依照巴爾都之計劃。原欲集結歐洲所有之國家。以謀法國之安全。故於南王亞力山大遊法之前。早已進行其聯絡意國之運動。自馬賽慘案而後。賴伐爾蕭規曹隨。循其故轍。盡其全力以消弭南匃意南之隔閡。力求法意之合作。秘密談判。已非一日。及至大局底定。始有羅馬之行。事前之預備。旣如是其久。雙方之談話。又如彼其密。宜其甫抵羅馬。大功卽行告成也。吾人於此。深佩法人外交手腕之靈敏。蓋法意二國。猜嫌素深。若以率直之方式進行談判。難免不致弄成僵局。去夏希特勒與墨索里尼會談之失敗。可爲明證。故法人對此絶少把握之難題。始終採取秘密談判之形式。必待内容完全確定無所變動之後。始爲形式上之訪問與簽約。蓋如此則談判如尚未妥。不妨繼續進行。萬一終不能成。亦可無形終止。伸縮自如。不拘形跡。宜其成功之時。殊出世人意料也。</p>
<p>兩國已簽訂之恊定。據外電所傳。計有三種。（一）爲關於北非殖民地之重新分配者。（二）爲關於多瑙河之公約及奥國獨立保障者。（三）爲對於歐洲問題。由兩國互相諮詢者。至其詳細内容。今雖尚不能知。然觀此數項。復參以兩國過去之關係。亦不難窺見一二。請試言其略。今次法意之合作。在法國方面。卽以北非殖民地爲鈎餌。而其希望。卽欲意大利對於歐洲問題。與法恊調。其可得言者。約有數端。（一）卽意大利歷來對於南斯拉夫之野心。從此而後。或可完全放棄。蓋意大利自大戰以來。常有向巴爾幹半島發展之意。其心目中。每以南斯拉夫爲對象。觀其庇護克羅脫人之恐怖黨。陰助與南感情最惡之匃牙利。卽可瞭然。唯今法國。旣於北非割讓相當之權益於意。外電更傳法人且默許意人在阿比西尼亞有自由行動之權。如是則意之土地野心。當可稍易其注意之方向矣。（二）爲奥國獨立之保障。雖將另訂國際公约。由奥之鄰國。共負責任。唯實際上担負此種保障者。必爲法意二國。可無疑義。（三）爲修約主張。似將從此失去有力之支持。意大利向以修約論號召中歐。今與力主維持歐洲現狀之法國相提携。當不能不稍變其主張。意國去夏以來。對於修約主張。態度日見曖昧。及至最近。如阿洛西等竟謂﹁意之修約理論。向主採取合法形式。此其迎合法國之意見。已經顯然。蓋今日之賴伐爾。固亦昌言非武力的修約主張者也。實則非武力之修約。早已失敗於往日。蓋此一主張。原爲法國白里安之創作。白氏於一九二六年將德國拉入國聯。卽爲此一﹁和平修約﹂所誘成。殊不知行政院中。法國旣佔極大勢力。和平修約。談何容易。故終白氏之身。歐洲地圖。迄無變動。此種情形。意大利目擊親受。焉有不知之理。且其前此改組國聯之說。亦爲對此而發。爲時無幾。焉有健忘若是。其實墨索里尼爲實際之政治家。彼固唯國利是視。不願永爲一理論主張所束縛也。（四）爲略增德國軍備。使德重入國聯。前此軍縮會議所以破裂之故。癥結全在法德軍備之爭。然就去年正月間各方之要求而觀。意見並不相差過甚。蓋德所求者爲三十萬人。而法所允許者爲二十萬人。英意之態度則介於此二爭點之間。後以法國要求國際監督德國軍備爲條件而歸於停頓。今法意結合之後。對德已可無虞。如此按照已往所已談至之程度。重新賡續談判。似爲安定歐局應有之步驟。如是則軍縮會議。又有重開之希望矣。</p>
<p>唯此事之關鍵。全在德國。就現勢而觀。德國内則禍機隠伏。外則發展無望。長此而往。殊非善計。德之當局。深知其然。故對法關係。力謀和緩。前此對外示威之言論行動。已不復見。希特勒亦且删削其自傳中之仇法句語。其欲與他國重修舊好之心。盎然可見。故於此期間。各國若能保全其顔面。於軍備上稍許其增加。則德之重入國聯。或非不可能之事也。</p>

<p>（二）法意共同建議、凡奥國各鄰邦及奥國應相互訂結不干涉及不侵略之恊定、法國·波蘭·羅馬尼亞·亦得加入、該恊定俾遇奥國土地完整遭遇威脅時、各國得與奥國舉行磋商、此種磋商辦法、以後得擴充至其他各國、以期獲得其恊助、</p>
<p>（三）兩國政府承認發展其本國與其非洲殖民地之經濟關係最爲相宜、特相約採取必要这準備、以求其實現、因此規定意大利得參加自法屬吉布底至阿比西尼亞京城阿提斯阿巴巴之鐵道經營權、</p>
<p>（四）關於軍備權平等問題、法意兩國政府根據一九三二年十二月十一日英美法德意五强宣言、共同承認、無論何國不得以單方面之行動、變更關於軍備之義務、關於此一問題、遇有必要時、兩國政府得相互磋商、</p>
<p>此外公報又稱、意相墨索里尼與法外長賴伐爾另行簽定一般問題之宣言、聲明將法意兩國間懸案解决一事予以備案、並申明兩國政府志願發揚兩國間之傳統友誼、並以相互信任之精神爲建設事業而合作、最後規定、凡一切問題、如爲環境所必要、均應由兩國政府相互磋商云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>一九三四年世界經濟的實况、世人有悲觀和樂觀兩種不同的觀察。前者因看到整個世界的貿易，依然極端萎縮，未敢遽言復興和繁榮；後者因各國國内經濟已有部分的恢復。然而實際上，一九三四年世界的經濟，是否解脫了數年來日趨惡化的恐慌而漸入繁榮之境呢？我們覺得一九三四年世界經濟最大的特色，是在於各國一致的奉行經濟國家主義。經濟國家主義，嚴密地說，是充分帶着閉關自守的色彩。因爲禁止輸入，狀勵輸出等關係，故在各國看來，容有部分的恢復，而在整個的世界看來，則經濟復興實仍在渺茫之中。且各國經濟恢復的内容、完全是發展軍需工業與厲行通貨膨脹政策的結果。而此兩者，都爲應付戰爭的準備。故我們以爲現在經濟國家主義的流行，國内經濟部分的恢復，實包藏着爆發第二次世界大戰的危機。一九三四年世界經濟的實况，告訴我們的盡是不容樂觀的材料。現在我們試分爲工業，農業，財睡金融，爭奪市塲，以及失業等狀態，作如次簡單的叙述。</p>
<p>據國聯調查世界經濟的報告，一九三四年世界的總生産額，是向上發展了。一九三四年四月，不僅已經恢復了一九二八年的百分之九五·五，比較一九三三年的八三·二，增加了很多。</p>
<p>世界工業生産的發展（據柏林景氣研究所，一九二八年爲一○○）</p>
<p>一九三三年每月平均　　　八三·二</p>
<p>一九三四年　　一月　　　八八·七</p>
<p>二月　　　九一·○</p>
<p>三月　　　九四·五</p>
<p>四月　　　九五·五</p>
<p>五月　　　九四·一</p>
<p>六月　　　九二·八</p>
<p>七月　　　八八·八</p>
<p>即就各國分别看來，也表現着發展的狀態。</p>
<p>主要國工業生産批數（據國聯統計月報）</p>
<p>１９２８＝１００　　美　　國　　英　　國　　德　　國　　法　　國　　日　　本</p>
<p>１９３２年平均　　５８·６　　８６·２　　　６０·５　　７７·５　　１１０·１</p>

<p>英國，美國，德國的工業生産指數，都超過前兩年的水準，尤其日本，更超過各國而飛騰發展；祗有法國反呈衰落之象、這就是說明能採取通貨膨脹政策，與不能不固守通貨緊縮政策的異點。法國有世界第二金庫之稱，且靠金利以爲生活的人很多，一時不易實行通貨膨脹政策，因而産業也隨之不振；故最近法國在極力壽劃金本位集團經濟的組織，其意無非爲保護自國産業的興旺。然而停止金本位，施行通貨膨脹政策的英，美，而其景氣的發展，也不過如此。</p>
<p>英美景氣指數</p>
<p>（英的數字據經濟雜誌調查，一九二四年爲一○○，美據Ａnnali·t調查水凖係推定）　　　　　　　　　　英　　　國　　　美　　　國</p>
<p>一九三二年</p>
<p>一月至八月平均　　　　　九五·六五　　　六三·八</p>
<p>一九三三年同期　　　　　九八·四九　　　七一·九</p>
<p>一九三四年同期　　　　一○七·八四　　　七六·二</p>
<p>英國雖較美國略爲好轉，然是人爲的，而且仍不見驚人的發展，英美尚且如此，全世界的景氣是怎樣情形，更可想而知了。</p>
<p>而且工業生産額增加的内容，多半是軍需工業的長進。關於軍需工業，因是各國的秘密，雖缺乏正確的統計，但我們可由鋼鐵工業生産率的增加，可以證明軍需工業迅速發展之一斑。世界鋼鐵的生産，自一九三三年以來，日見繁榮。一九三四年上半年，增加的情狀更爲顯著。兹將主要國如英，美，德，蘇四國的鋼鐵生産額，列表如次：</p>
<p>國别　　　生　産　額　　　一九三三年上半年</p>
<p>美國　　　七、○一九　　　三、○二七（單位千噸）</p>
<p>德國　　　二、五七○　　　一、五九二</p>
<p>英國　　　二、二四九　　　一、五○五</p>
<p>蘇聯　　　二、一一六　　　一、○五八</p>
<p>合計　　一三、九五四　　　七、一八二</p>
<p>（據文化建設第一卷第三期七七頁）</p>
<p>牛年間鋼鐵的增加率，竟達百分之四十一；下半年且更有增加的傾向。道還不能說是世界將臨到戰爭的危機嗎？　　　（未完）</p>

<p>緣景璧係海門縣公安局第七分局局長、秉性粗暴、酷嗜殺人、曾於民國十九年十一月四日、乘海門縣境共匪猖獗之際、藉詞肅淸盜匪、在大城鎭施雲路茶店内、用槍擊斃茶客楊兆梯一名、事後以楊兆梯爲盜開槍拒捕、當塲擊斃朦報、同年十二月二十四日、又在三星鎭南三里許施家宅前、喝令巡官繆鳳祥、將所捕嫌疑盜犯洪維新一名、開槍擊斃、亦以洪維新奪槍抗捕、當塲格斃朦縣、經海啓被寃後援會呈控監察院、</p>

<p>由中央公務員懲戒委員會函送江蘇高等法院、移案偵查、（起訴理由及所犯法條）本件景璧·繆鳳祥·等藉詞楊兆梯·洪維新·爲盜、以開槍拒捕爲由、擅行濫殺、業經被害人家屬黄定一·洪劉氏·洪維淸·等到庭、陳述歷歷、並經監察院調查專員毛憲前往被害地點調查屬實、調閱原縣卷宗、非但該景璧呈文稱楊兆梯與同黨多人、在施雲露茶店内密議、職等正欲向前拘捕、該盜楊兆梯與其同夥一人各在身中</p>
<h3 id="c206">拔出槍械 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>向職等抗擊、職等見盜開槍不止、勢甚兇猛、恐遭危險、即予發槍還擊、彈中楊兆梯胸部、立時倒斃等語、核與原縣騐斷書内載楊兆梯致命脊背有進口槍子傷三處、由胸膛出情形不符、且據該茶店主人施雲露在原縣供稱、當日我只聞槍聲三響、進到屋裏、楊兆梯已被打死了云云、是楊兆梯當時並無開槍拒捕情節、顯爲景璧任意濫殺、尤無疑義、至洪維新</p>

<p>事實、何至景璧等五六人全無受傷、况旣被捕、又何至有機奪取槍械、更何敢以奪得一槍、突行抵抗五六槍械、所辯顯係遁飾、核其所爲、景璧依刑法第四十三條犯兩個同法第二百八十二條第一項之罪、繆鳳祥犯一個第二百八十二條第一項之罪、均應依大赦條例第二條及刑法第一百四十條處斷、爰以刑事訴訟法第二百五十三條起訴云云、曾奉關立廷推事開庭研訊未結、昨日上午、仍由關推事特開</p>

<p>王新命·何炳松·武堉幹·孫寒冰·黄文山·陶希聖·章益·陳高傭·樊仲雲·蕯孟武·等發出中國本位的文化建設宣言云、</p>
<p>一·没有了中國　在文化的領域中、我們看不見現在的中國了、中國在對面不見人形的濃霧中、在萬象蜷伏的嚴寒中、没有光、也没有熱、爲着尋覓光與熱、中國人正在苦悶、正在摸索、正在掙扎、有的雖拚命鑽進古人的墳墓、想向骷髏分一點餘光、乞一點餘熱、有的抱着歐美傳敎師的脚、希望傳敎師放下一根超度衆生的繩、把他們吊上光明温暖的天堂、但骷髏是把他們從黑暗的邊緣帶到黑暗的深淵、從蕭瑟的晚秋導入凛烈的寒冬、傳敎師是把他們懸在半空中、使他們在上不着天下不着地的虚無境界中漂泊流浪憧憬摸索、結果是同一的失望、中國在文化的領域中是消失了、中國政治的形態、社會的組織、和思想内容與形式已經失去它的特徵、由這没有特徵的政治社會、和思想所化育的人民、也漸漸的不能算得中國人、所以我們可以肯定的說、從文化的領域去展望現代世界裏面固然已經没有了中國、中國的領土裏面也幾乎已經没有了中國人、要使中國能在文化的領域中抬頭、要使中國的政治社會、和思想都具有中國的特徵、必須從事於中國本位的文化建設、日本的畫家常常說、﹁西洋人雖嫌日本畫的色彩過於强烈、但若日本畫没有那種剌目的强烈色彩、那裏還成爲日本畫﹂我們在文化建設上、也需要有這樣的認識、要從事中國本位的文化建設、必須用批評的態度、科學的方法、檢閱過去的中國、把握現在的中國、建設將來的中國、我們應在這三方面盡其最大的努力、</p>
<p>二·一個總淸算　中國在文化的領域中、曾占過很重要的位置、從太古直到秦漢之際、都在上進的過程中、春秋戰國形成了我們的希臘羅馬時代、那眞是中國文化大放異彩的隆盛期、但漢代以後、中國文化就停頓了、宋明雖然還有一個新的發展、綜合了固有的儒道、和外來的佛學、然而並未超出過去文化的範圍、究竟是因襲的東西、直到鴉片戰爭纔發生了很大的質的變動、巨艦大砲帶來了西方文化的消息、帶來了威脅中國步入新時代的警告、於是古老的文化起了動搖、我們乃從因襲的睡夢中醒覺了、隨着這種醒覺而發生的、便是曾國藩李鴻章的﹁洋務﹂運動、康有爲梁啓超的﹁維新﹂運動、孫中山先生的﹁革命﹂運動、曾李的洋務運動祗知道﹁堅甲利兵﹂和﹁聲光化電﹂的重要、完全是技藝的模仿、康梁的維新運動在於變法自强、不過是政治的抄襲、這都可說是﹁中學爲體西學爲用﹂的見解、雖在當時也自有其除舊布新之歷史的使命、然畢竟是皮毛的和改良的辦法、不能滿足當時的要求、於是有孫中山先生所領導的辛亥革命、他以把中國固有的﹁從根救起來﹂把人家現有的﹁迎頭趕上去﹂爲前提、主張對中國的社會政治經濟作澈底的改革、</p>

<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>玉乳井，是南京最近發現的，我們祇看這﹁玉乳井﹂三個字，就可以知道它是一口不平凡的古井了！</p>
<p>發現的經過是這樣的：距離中華門外有十餘里的地方，有個安德門，本來是明代所建的一座外城。在那城的旁邊，有一座小土山，名字也很香艶的，呌做﹁玉環山﹂。這山上，有幾十間房屋，都住着農人，更有一所花寺廟宇，興隆寺，也都是明代建築的。不過因爲距城較遠，所以都中人士對於這個地方，是很少知道的。</p>
<p>在最近，興隆寺的住持僧濟航，看見寺後有一座垃圾堆成的小土邱，實在是不很雅觀，所以就喊了幾個鄉人，把它運走，那知道把這小土邱剷平以後，竟發現這口﹁玉乳井﹂。於是濟航主持，又破費了幾個代價，把井裏的泥土運出，又於是這口古井，就完全出現了！</p>
<p>這玉乳井是完全用白礬石築成的，那花紋非常的精細。井的上面，刻着﹁玉乳井﹂，和﹁永樂十五年重建﹂的字樣。井的底下，也是白礬石築成，上面有幾個小孔，作梅花的式樣，那井水就由這幾個小孔裏冐出，初時是很淸的水，再過一下子，就變成和人乳一樣的水了！所以呌做﹁玉乳井﹂。據主持僧濟航告訴我們：這水味又香又甜，如果用以烹茶，眞是别饒風味哩！</p>

<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>到了冬令，街頭巷尾，每有鄉下人挑着擔子，喊着賣雞，以應居户人家的需要。</p>
<p>雞價今年眞算便宜：往年每元不過二三斤，現在每元可買到四五斤，（雌雞四斥，雄雞五斤。）而且是足十六兩秤。這大約也是農村破産的一種表現吧！</p>
<p>這種便宜的雞，你倘然多買了幾隻，要想豢豢起來，以備不時之需。那末你反而要上當，得不償失。因爲這種雞，隔了一二日，往往作怪聲的呌。雞冠也由紅變爲紫黑，甚至不食不動。這時你若再不把它來宰殺，說不定就要壽終正寢。但這是什麽緣故呢？你只要把雞宰殺了，割了腹，就可以明白。因爲它的食囊，會特别脹大。其中食物不化，或雜以泥砂之類。這就是它作怪呌的原因：這般販雞的人，爲增重雞的分量起見，所以預先塞足了食物。把好好的雞，弄得奄奄待斃。這種殘酷手段，眞有些可恨。現在本埠慈善家發起的保護動物會，對於各種動物，都要設法保護。再如有人倒提了雞，在租界内行走。給巡捕瞧見，就要拘入捕房處罰。體恤動物，可謂周至。但像以上的硬塞雞食，却還無法加以取締咧。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>﹁從前的時候，武功是十分注意的！一個做領袖的人，除掉處理朝廷上的一切政務之外，射獵也算是一件不能偷懶的重要工作。時時有舉行的必要。﹂太后又在頌揚祖武了。我們一羣人照例是很用心地傾聽着。當他射獵的時候，人是帶得很多的，因爲我們滿洲人打獵，從來是不用獵狗的，所以不能不多帶幾個人帮着他搜尋野獸。這些野獸丨大都是猛虎和金錢豹丨乃是預先捕捉來的，用很大的籠子畜養着，臨時再縱出來。······</p>

<p>（序）近觀影戲有桃李刦者，生徒悲劇也。因感觸舊事，書之如次：</p>
<p>淸光緒中葉，余首開關中風氣，如報館，講演，皆所創始；而於小學敎育，尤爲致力，所創辦之學校，卽以甘園爲名；爾時風氣尚未開，時人呼爲﹁洋學堂﹂；然經始之年，負笈來學者已達數十百人，殊非易事；就中有浙籍周翁子名承恩者，年十一歲，翁晚生子也，聰頴勤學，余甚愛之。渠有姊長承恩數歲，秀外慧中，亦嘗就内子問字；越年餘，翁有至戚宦於鳳翔，招翁佐幕政，翁以子求學故，留眷省垣，隻身往幕所。逾歲，一日校中課，點名不見周承恩，方欲走伻問之，而周家遣人來爲承恩請病假，余心遂感不安，課畢趨往探視，見其熱度甚高，卽囑其家人特别注意，俾早告痊。越數日，又不至，使人問之，則病劇且危，譫語不止，所語多學校事；且語中偶謂：﹁閻老師來矣，你們速爲招待。·········﹂余聞之戚然！復往視，見其神智迷惘，覩余來，目灼灼視，且翻身作叩頭狀，余之悲涙奪眶而出矣！越日果卒，其母姊鑑於翁年事已高，只此一子，恐傷其心，相偕赴翁所，且僞言留其子在校，一切付余照料矣。如此數年，其母亦死，翁以父女二人旅居不便卽携女返省，行裝甫卸，其女急暗遣人告余，囑見渠父時只云代送承恩於上海某校，因業務甚勤，不克遄返，並擬送往國外留學云云，意欲如此渡過其父殘年而已。少頃，翁果來，向余殷殷致謝，謂承蒙代送伊子赴滬求學，深爲感激，伊且以雙掛號信詢問一切矣；余以不便置答，唯唯而已。越數日，其女翩然來余家，入門卽云：﹁我來專爲老師師母叩頭也，旋談承恩事，又囑如前；且徧觀余家前後，並詢問一切甚詳，蓋當時余次兒方斷絃，伊父擬向余家提議婚事也。越日而伊家遣媒至，余以未徵次兒同意，不克遽允。會翁怨家悉其事，向余次兒造讕言，兒年少識淺，墮其計！婚議遂寢。而周女因失望頓攖重疾，時翁寄滬之信，亦因滬上並無此校，原信退回；翁因發言閻氏置吾兒何所，乃欺吾，吾將訟之；女病危，迷惘中，忽淸醒慷慨謂父曰：﹁我病且不起矣！吾弟承恩於某年某日，以某疾死，葬於某處，僞言求學者，安老父心也；此與閻宅無涉，可勿問也。﹂言訖而逝，翁猶以爲病中亂命，及詢之舊同居多人乃信。越日，翁來謂余曰：﹁吾兒已早死，家人見瞞，倘非吾女臨終直告，吾幾寃君矣！﹂嗣翁以古稀老人，别無罣礙，隻身南旋，音問不通，未知所終云。</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>今年是學生國貨年，以最純潔最努力最愛國的學生，來幹這提倡國貨服用國貨的工作，當然是最相宜最有效騐的。</p>
<p>白銀滾滾流，　　　　洋貨源入，</p>
<p>何以塞漏巵？　　　　國貨上努力。</p>
<p>挽救白銀外流的恐慌，千方萬法，總不及從提倡國貨服用國貨上用工夫來得有效騐有成績。靑年學生，從識字的幼孩，以及大學生，乃至曾做當過學生的老學生，都該從今年起，大家來奮發熱心的幹他一下。黄任之先生說：﹁學生國貨年，吾也是幹的一份子，因爲我也做過學生，年紀愈老，幹的興致愈好。﹂這種精神，可以做我靑年們的模範。</p>
<p>中國人都該用中國貨，</p>
<p>從大人到小孩，從男子到婦女，</p>
<p>都要踴躍的來做。</p>
<p>不要去年是婦女當拕，</p>
<p>今年只讓學生去做。</p>
<p>結果你推我讓，</p>
<p>一定要弄得一榻糊塗。</p>
<p>本來所謂什麽國貨年，也不過是標出一個名稱，來做全國人服用國貨的倡導，並非說那一界的國貨年，便只靠那一界努力，責成那一界負責。去年是﹁婦女國貨年，﹂難道男子就不負責任，可以去用洋貨嗎？今年是﹁學生國貨年，﹂難道婦女的責任便算已盡，可以不必再去服用國貨嗎？吾常說：今年是﹁學生國貨年﹂的第一年，便是﹁婦女國貨年﹂的第二年，也是﹁國貨年﹂的第三年。有人說得好：大家要認淸今年就不是﹁學生國貨年，﹂學生也應當用國貨。更須認淸在﹁學生國貨年，﹂就不是做學生的，也應當用國貨。總之服用國貨，提倡國貨，凡是熱心人，凡是中國人，個個都有責任，都要努力。下面許多學生界的意見，儘够大家明白了。</p>
<p>凡是中國人，都用中國貨，不分那一年，努力向前做，小孩到大人，丈夫到婦女，不分你和我，不分貧和富，重擔共一肩，責任大家負。</p>

<p>— 滬江大學新聞學科張致中</p>
<p>人世間最不幸的，莫過于不幸的啞吧與患了灘瘓的病人，因爲他們雖然具着四肢五官，可是他們却不能自由行動，說出自己要說想說的話語，如同一般健康的人們一樣。</p>
<p>說來眞是可憐，我們的國家受着客觀事實的限制，也是這樣地變做了啞吧，變做了不幸的癱瘓者的：！！撇開什末敵人以武力侵佔了我們底領土，我們應以武力收復的大道理不講，别人家以長期的經濟侵略作手段，來制我們的死命，陷我們于國破家亡民窮財盡的當前的可怕的事實，我們連抵貨的口號也不能呌出，抵貨的運動也頗沈寂，不是和那啞吧，那癱瘓的病人一樣地不幸，一樣地可憐嗎？！！雖然應着客觀事實的需要，一年一度的﹁國貨年﹂舉行起來，担負着增加國貨生産，减少外貨入超，抵制外貨傾銷的工作。</p>
<p>去歲呌做﹁婦女國貨年，﹂婦女們和國貨廠商們也曾努力地工作過，國貨展覽會也曾在上海，杭州，南京，長沙，宜昌，西安舉行了，時裝大會也曾在上海南京等地表演了，然而結果呢？日貨還是大量地傾銷中國，去歲一月至十月貿易入超達四億三千萬元之巨。而民族工業的危機愈形尖銳化，絲業衰落了，紡織業也衰落了，其他如橡膠業，火柴業，洋灰業，搪瓷業，毛織業，熱水瓶業，製油業，洋傘業等···還是一樣地不景氣。</p>
<p>爲什末呢？</p>
<p>這是，很顯然地，在不平等條約束縛下，在關稅不能完全自主的制度下，幼稚的民族工業爲資本與技術俱極進步的列强的資本主義的經濟所摧毁，一天天地被逼到日暮途窮的絶境。</p>
<p>然而國貨，畢究需要提倡的，民族工業仍得需要人們始終愛護，如果等待不平等條約解除了，關稅完全自主了以後，再來提倡它，愛護它，那嗎，東洋和西洋的資本家恐怕早已將我們口袋里的洋鈿賺乾了！我們的購買力减低到只够喝風。</p>
<p>據說某和尚問道：﹁進前三步如何？﹂答覆是：﹁撞頭碰額！﹂﹁退後三步如何？﹂丨﹁一落千丈！﹂丨﹁不進不退如何？﹂丨﹁立地死滅！﹂</p>
<p>現在我們所遭受到的經濟危機，就是這樣地重大而無法避免，如果不願死滅，不願一落千丈的話，那嗎，只好碰着頭皮衝上前去，辦法是：努力于關稅完全自主，不平等條約完全廢除，産業現代化，管理合理化的工作。雖然這工作也許撞頭碰額的。</p>
<p>今年是學生國貨年了，學生們國貨廠商們，全體國民們，我們大家聯合起來，共同努力奮鬥吧！</p>

<p>— 國立上海商學院譚秉文</p>
<p>時人對於國貨業之前途頗有抱悲觀之望者，良有感乎國貨運動提倡之不得其法，且收效亦復鮮尠也。國貨年逝矣，而工商業益臻衰敝！婦女國貨年逝矣，而外貨之脂粉香水及其他婦女用品之輸入額，較諸往年，未有减色，抑且有增！鑒往知來，我人之提倡今年爲學生國貨年，苟一如往昔，提倡者自提倡，而當事者藐藐，則其結果可得而預言矣。悲失！國人精神之萎靡，一至於此，中國國民經濟前途其能有趨於光明境域之希望乎？吾儕學生，爲國民中優秀分子，民族復興之責，置其肩仔之上。國貨運動之勃興，請以學生國貨年始。</p>
<p>戰後之德意志，内則工商業衰敗，外則負債累累，其所以於數年中完成經濟復興者，豈偶然哉！此蓋日耳曼人愛國之心，勝於他族有以致之也。德人自歐戰慘敗後，謀工商業之復興，爰制定所謂﹁産業十誡﹂，國貨業之振興，胥賴乎是。不侫有鑒乎過去提倡國貨運動之失敗，爰竭厥愚誠，幾經斟酌，草擬學生國貨年十誡，以示同道。其文曰；</p>
<p>（一）國貨文具，旣廉且美，凡我學生，極力倡用。</p>
<p>（二）體育足以强身，採用國貨體育器具，足以救國。</p>
<p>（三）在汝之身體尚未失去自由之時，汝應服用國貨服裝。</p>
<p>（四）食用國産物品，始能培養愛國之氣。</p>
<p>（五）汝有一錢，必存諸本國銀行。</p>
<p>（六）汝出遊時，母乘外商輪船。</p>
<p>（七）汝觀電影時，母入外商電影院，母觀外國影片。</p>
<p>（八）汝每用一錢，亦必以國家之福利爲依歸。</p>
<p>（九）汝每日必勸汝之親友採用國貨。</p>
<p>（十）汝每日自省有否違犯﹁國貨十誡</p>
<p>今日中國之民族工商業，幾瀕於山窮水盡之境。卽以繁華甲全國之上海而言，工廠停工者幾佔泰半，商店倒閉者日有數起。長此以往，設想何堪？救亡圖存，以提倡國貨爲當務之亟。我莘莘學子，濟濟出衆，昔日以國貨之叛徒見稱，今日應如何刻苦自勵負荆贖罪。德意志之前車可鑒，我輩急起直追，已覺太遲。嗚呼！因循苟且，固步自封，勢將自招亡滅。痛改前非，猛奮夜鞭，自救實正其時。寄語同道，幸勿河漢斯言</p>

<p>— 金陵女子大學侯婉如女士</p>
<p>姊妹們！我們是幸福的，在這國家多事之秋，經濟恐慌之時，我們居然跨進了大學校，我們該怎樣的快活？同時，我們的責任是多麽重大？父兄對於我們的期望又是多麽的深切？所以，我們是應該怎樣的努力前進？</p>
<p>我們所受的敎育，是超過於普通的女同胞，我們是受着特優的栽培，我們自己應該怎樣的努力？庶不負父兄國家的期望！現在，二十四年已開始了，社會把提倡國貨的責任，鄭重地交給全國學生，定今年爲學生國貨年。那末，正在受大學敎育的我們，應該怎樣的來負起這個使命？以促進學生國貨年的名實相符！</p>
<p>姊妹們在大學中求學的，家庭經濟至少總可以過得去，所以，大學中的女同學們，是不需要擔心經濟的來源。（例外當然也有）因此，很多數的同學，就流於奢華，服用外貨的惡習，自然而然養成了。姊妹們！我們自己檢查一下，在我們的寢室洗臉室中，陳列的化裝品，以及用具，大部份是國貨呢？還是外貨？我想大家不免要問心有愧罷？然而，過去的已成了往事，未來者尚可追我們請從今日始，負起我們學生國貨年的責任，痛改前非。</p>
<p>我國社會上的一般人，總以爲學生比其他階級有希望，且有體面，尤其是大學生；因爲，我們中國人能够受到適常敎育的，實在很少，學生們的舉動，旁人頂願模範，尤其是女學生的服飾，這有很多事實可以證明：就以穿靑布衫來說罷，靑布衣服本來是鄉下大媽穿的，城市中的小姐，是絶對不願把靑布作爲衣料，但是，後來這種靑布，被學校當局定爲校服，當時，學生們都反對，我那時還在中學讀書，記得有許多同學，聯合起來正式對訓育主任提出抗議說：﹁我們不贊成穿靑布衫黑裙，這樣像賣魚婆，我們也不願穿靑布長衫，這樣像裁縫師父；若一定要穿校服，我們情願穿灰色的。﹂但，學校當局没有答應，且有﹁不穿校服卽作曠課論﹂的規定。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>於是，學生們只得恨恨地穿上了，時候一久，社會上的女人，都穿起靑布衫來，漸漸地，靑布衫簡直變了頂摩登的衣服。難道社會上的女人，都願做賣魚婆或裁缝師父嗎？不是，那是社會上的人士，對於學生的羡慕而從以模仿的緣故。所以，我們相信，女學生的服飾，尤其是大學生，對於社會的習俗，是很有影響的。姊妹們！我們何不利用一下我們這種力量呢？一方面可以節省父兄的錢，一方面我們做了一位服用國貨的好學生，况且，化裝品中，國貨比ＴhreeＦlowers好的很多。用品中，民生墨水不見得比Ｗaterman壞，價值却便宜不少。我們爲什麽一定要把金錢送到外國去，而受他們砲火的回禮呢？</p>
<p>姊妹們！我們是站在智識階級的上層，我們都有相當的國家觀念。從今後，我們對於服用外貨的惡習，有則改之，無則加勉，方不負社會對我們的期望</p>

<p>民國二十四年是學生國貨年，我們是學生，就該認識個淸楚。</p>
<p>去年是婦女國貨年，爲甚麽是失敗了呢？是她們不知道用了洋貨就把自己的錢送給外國的資本家嗎？不，她們是知道的。我以爲最堪注意的就是她們的﹁心理病態﹂，她們往往以爲用外國貨是榮耀的事！大批洋貨是推銷了！</p>
<p>由於過去的弱點，我們就應改進，就是先得去掉這種﹁心理病態﹂！不要以爲用洋貨是榮耀的事，相反的，倒是用國貨才是榮耀的！我們更該知道全國除了我們學生，誰還能懂得這時代的經濟組織，帝國主義者以其條約的特權，把他過剩的生産口貶價競賣，國貨自是不易發展的！但我們學生，我們懂得最緊要的關鍵，就是祗要大家不買外國貨，國貨還怕不暢銷嗎？</p>
<p>認淸了這，這學生國貨年是不會像去年那樣失敗的。</p>
<p>好，全國學生們，實踐起來，單說便是自殺！</p>

<p>— 南洋中學俞百祿</p>
<p>婦女國貨年的過去，給我們以一個歷史的敎訓，所謂××國貨年，便是××所挨駡的年頭。一樣的，今年便是咱們學生所埃駡的時候了。據說，去年婦女的舶來品，十之七八銷之於文化水凖最高的上海婦女，因此，用文化水凖愈高用舶來品愈多的事實，來引之於今年的學生國貨年，我深信，不需到今年的年底，咱們所挨駡的聲音，一定多之於去年婦女所曾受到的，因此，在今天學生國貨年的起點，我想來談談關於恥的認識，苦口婆心者，無非希望及於來者而已。</p>
<p>學生之於恥，自來都不能認得淸楚，他們以爲買買國貨是可恥的，但是未曾想到買英國美國·······等貨有同樣的可恥，他們以爲某國店絶對不能進去，卽使不得已買某國書的時候，仍舊有恐别人看見，偷偷的向××書店裏一鑽，一回，又急急的向外一溜，但是當他們上拔佳（Ｂata）買皮鞋的時候，却昻首進去，再慢慢的提着鞋盒子出來，前者後者，似乎完全兩樣。</p>
<p>有時同學買一瓶民生墨水來，﹁民生墨水太蹩脚了，没有華脫門好﹂。用民生墨水，他是以爲可恥的。於是偷偷的另裝在華脫門墨水的空瓶子裏。同學們用關勒民，博士等牌子的自來水筆，他們不時常拿出來用，其原因，並不是珍貴他們的筆，却是怕同學們看見了會取笑這﹁蹩脚的國貨﹂，用這﹁蹩脚的國貨﹂是可恥的，於是他藏起來了。</p>
<p>以上不過是幾個例子，其中，我們可以明顯的看出學生之恥。以有恥爲無恥，以無恥爲有恥，這才造成了國貨事業的末路。</p>
<p>咱們學生是一切的前導，咱們不應該稍微失了人家的敬仰，再給人家唾駡，在買一樣貨品以前，咱們應該以自己的身分，自己的時代環境，在有恥與無恥之間，認一個淸楚。</p>
<p>咱們原自有力量的，咱們原是有頭腦的，朋友，在今年的除夕，（不，不僅是今年）看咱們的成績。</p>

<p>— 中法工專頴耿</p>
<p>今年是學生國貨年，爲了希望能在這年頭幹一點實際工作，我考察了許多大學生及中學生日用的東西，結果十分之六七都是洋貨，最普通的有下面幾種：</p>
<p>文具！墨水，自來水筆，大半學生所用的墨水是華德門美國貨，自來水筆是康克令派克卡德等，按國貨墨水也有大華民生麗文等，國貨自來水筆則有關勒民新民華孚等，但仍不敵洋貨之得勢</p>
<p>儀器，我們不大能看見國貨儀器，他們所用的，大多是德國Ｆaber廠出品</p>
<p>運動器具，樂器！課餘的時間，中學生大學生終得玩玩運動或音樂，但，運動器具中如網球拍，棒球棒，足球鞋，跑鞋，跳鞋，···樂器中各種西樂器，他們用的都也是洋貨。</p>
<p>餘如牙膏，褲帶，西裝，帽鞋，手套等等大半亦是洋貨。</p>
<p>中大學生用洋貨是成習慣了，他們用了國貨是好像羡恥的，原因是（一）不信任國貨的觀念；（二）洋貨與國貨物質上之差異，如儀器文具等，國貨確實不能使人十分信仰；（三）中大學生大半是資産階級的子弟，幼時在家庭早養成用洋貨之習慣；（四）虚榮心理。</p>
<p>補救備法，則不外（一）創設更偉大的廠家，出品更使精良凖確；（二）校内組織提倡國貨及審查會；（三）組織消費合作社，專售優美國貨，使學生免出外購物之煩，並得購國貨；（四）宣傳國貨之優點；（五）獎勵徵求學生供給國貨廠家改良出品之途徑等等。</p>
<p>個人的意見當然不見得對的，尚望各方盡量討論。</p>
<h3 id="c272">學生國貨年和文具 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 潘吟閣</p>
<p>民國二十四年公定爲學生國貨年，學生國貨年，當然有他們的偉大的表現。不過我在這篇文章裏邊，却提出一個小小的題目，就是學生所用的文具。</p>
<p>學生國貨年的文具，好像婦女國貨年的脂粉。婦女的脂粉已經引起了不少人的注意了。學生所用的文具，千萬要提倡國貨，同時要少用洋貨，不用劣貨</p>
<p>第一說提倡國貨。拿作者自已來講。我自己作文必定要中國文具。這兩年每年平均翻譯一部書。所用的稿紙，是中國毛邊，徽州墨，湖州筆。和友人通信所用信箋信封，也是國貨。覺得非常雅致，對人亦非常恭敬。有的人寫稿子往往用洋紙，是不對的。至於用洋信封洋信箋和人通信，更覺不恭敬。</p>
<p>第二說少用洋貨。文具要完全廢除洋貨，是不可能的。譬如旅行時有所考察，要隨時作筆記，當然以用鉛筆爲便。不過鉛筆可以說尚無國貨，所以洋貨不能不用。但的確可以少用。譬如在室内起草就可用毛筆了。現在學生們每喜用洋貨。在可以不用的時候，尚還樂用洋貨。在這學生國貨年裏深望改變方針</p>
<p>第三說不用劣貨。現在有種學生心愛洋貨，而又嫌牠價值昻貴，乃選購價廉的文具，就不知不覺的用劣貨了。其實嫌貴還是不買的好。譬如自來水筆，價貴的果然不必買。但價賤的更不可買。所以我自已就不喜歡這東西。我是常常期待着中國有一家好的自來水筆工廠</p>

<h3 id="c274">我提倡國貨的經歷 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 大夏大學商學院屈開熙</p>
<p>生産落後的我國，提倡國貨已成爲衆口一詞的救亡國圖存良法了，一個民族要永恒的存在世界上，出産品必須有自供自給的能力，而提倡國貨，就是鼓勵出産品，定成自供自給的途徑，我本着這種重要性，而熱烈的參加工作，但决不是一般不兌現的高調，下面是促成我服用和提倡國貨的成效：（甲）促成服用國貨的因素：</p>
<p>（一）良好的提倡國貨家庭，我的家長受過新敎育，的洗禮，他們有遠大的眼光，充分的認識，所以他們的家庭敎育；對於兒童的心理就先有國貨是美麗的，切實服用的習慣養成，差不多家裏的一切日用品，無一不是先以國貨爲採用的先决條件，因此，我同我的弟妹們都養我的良好的用國貨習慣。</p>
<p>（二）學校風氣的感化：本校敎育學院院長邰爽秋博士，他提倡土布運動，同學中參加的很多，這樣便形成了本校的樸素風氣，我在這種環境中，日常都穿着制服，使我精神振作，作事稱便，體格健强，而家庭擔負的費用却節省多了</p>
<p>（乙）、提倡國貨的實踐：</p>
<p>（一）介給精美的國貨給親友：我同我的家庭，在親友們娘喪喜慶時，贈送的禮物都以國貨，或國貨公司的禮券，這樣送他們，使他們的對國貨有正確的認識，和引起他們的覺悟。</p>
<p>（二）以文字改正鎖誤的觀念：國人對於國貨旣莫有相當的認識當然容易發生錯誤的見解，因以我常以女字介紹國貨的美點，并貢獻提倡的的意見：</p>
<p>一，對社會人士介紹國貨的精良，和服用的利益。</p>
<p>二，對工廠貢獻生産實用品的意見</p>
<p>三，對某國貨公司職員用外貨鉛筆，（鷄牌）而不以國貨的大華鉛筆代替的糾正，和補救的方法。</p>
<p>四，對學校主張學穿制服爲减少家庭負擔，免除學生入舞塲，到不正當娱樂塲所的好方法。</p>
<p>上面是我的良好環境促成我的服用國貨，和我提倡國貨的經歷，今年是學生國貨年，我希望與論的督促，政府敎育機關的獎勵和懲罰，廠商的優待，家庭和學校的密切聯絡監視學生澈底服用國貨，同時盼望全國的同學們自覺，永遠的用國貨，我們要知道用外貨是最可恥的呀！</p>

<h3 id="c318">論詩歌的形式 <a href="#c318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>— 陳君涵</p>
<p>詩歌是社會的産物。</p>
<p>詩歌中最重大的問題便是内容與形式。我每以爲内容與形式的一致性是成爲絶對地顛撲不破的課題。一般地以爲這種的一致是預先假定着矛盾，而且不相容的。可是這是一種錯誤。文藝這東西必須說明文學的法則是整個的，是一種社會的機能，是一種特殊的上層建築，然而在它的說明之中是必須包括着形式的問題。</p>
<p>我這裏所說的形式和形式主義没有關係。形式主義的理論是和形式主義的藝術緊密地相聯契。形式主義之最重大的錯誤是它拿藝術和現社會的複雜性分離開來，形式的分析固是有用而且必不可少，但形式主義者們却奉之爲天經地義。</p>
<p>爲着要求作品的内容與形式的一致，我們就不能不顧及遺産繼承和熟練藝術技巧問題了。那麽就要問我們如何可從已往的大師，或古籍中去學習呢？要解答這個問題須知否定不是一個簡單的破壞過程，却是一種新生的形態。黑格爾說得好，﹁古人是在已有的形式中存在着﹂的。雖然繼承原是可能，實際上還是免不了一個破壞。</p>
<p>現在我們如果拿過去的詩歌來作一檢討，拿它和實生活的偉大的内容相比較，那麽詩歌的内容則慘淡不堪了。我們的詩歌還没有達到能了解我們時代的整個意義的水平。</p>
<p>所以我們就不能不顧及到詩歌的取材。那就是說詩歌裏的取材必須和我們時代的複雜性及其所有的矛盾性相適合。從這樣的見地來取材就會得着一致。</p>
<p>如果我們需要多種詩歌的材料，那就不難明白，依照形式和内容聯合的結果，多種詩歌的形式是必需的。</p>
<p>哀歌的節奏和軍歌的節奏就不能相同，因爲形象的反應，同時便是它情緒的内容。不過假如我們承認多種的詩歌材料並且認爲是合宜的，結果，也就有多種的詩歌形式，在這樣的塲合，什麽是形式一致的原動力呢？如其眞的具有了形式和内容的一致，那麽，取材的一致必與形式的一致相諧和，自不待言。這種重複的一致就會由於風格的一致或是方法的一致而獲得。</p>
<p>詩歌創造的形式應該是千種萬别。它們所有的一致性是由於一種同樣偉大的風格或是由於社會的現實主義的方法而來的。</p>
<p>最近期現代上郁達夫先生的談詩談及新和舊詩，依他的意思新詩能否成立，還成問題，甚且敎人不要去做；至於舊詩，依着歷史的程序，﹁祇敎中國的文字不改變，着洋裝喝白蘭酒的摩登少年，也必定要哼哼唧唧地唱些五個字七個字的詩句來消遣，﹂寫這篇文章的人完全忽略了詩歌的内容與形式一致的問題了；他只是發揮了他的狹窄的偏見而已。</p>
<h3 id="c319">老伙伴 <a href="#c319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>像愛搭新窠的喜鵲在一顆樹上住不了半個月似的，自己也是一個那麽好動的傢伙，總是作着騰雲遊天空的夢，便滿處住上個把月，好在單身客搬家是那麽簡便的。</p>
<p>最近，又提着網籃舗藍走進這舊屋的空廓的後院，滿院子的秃樹敗草使人心淸氣爽，雖然看不見花也看不見果，是陰森的魔王駕卸着世界的冬天啊。</p>
<p>夜晚，在燈下獨自個打開舗蓋攤着地舗時，忽的打南面幾間空房裏傳出了幾聲咳嗽，像是費了多大力氣般，咳完了又哼哼着，明明是個老頭子。然而記得那些房是空着的，便一個寒噤連着一個寒噤。蒙在被裏，想起平日傳說的狐仙來，狐仙是住在靜僻的犄角裏的，頰下掛着白鬍子，走起路來搖幌着毛茸茸的尾巴，輕咳着。</p>
<p>那夜，夢裏碰到了一羣帶着騷味的大狐狸小狐狸。</p>
<p>第二天淸早跑到外院住客那裏探問。</p>
<p>﹁住着一個退了任的軍人哩，不用怕，滿和善的，﹂她又加上一句：﹁當兵的威武會隨着脫下的軍裝走凈的﹂。</p>
<p>一泰然地回到後院時，一個傴僂着背的老人站在南屋的階下，在用一個嗽口杯澆一盆嫩綠的文竹，一隻空着的手還不時撫摩着那悄然展開的淸娟的綠葉。眞的有鬍子垂着呢，只是顔色是灰的。</p>
<p>爲着報復一夜的虚驚，我也冷不防地輕咳了一聲。他應聲抬起頭來，伸直了腰看倒還是個魁梧的身材，有半個疤爬出在小氈帽下，直視的眼光露出了他的眞純。</p>
<p>我笑了，他也陪了一個，眼皮　了一下。</p>
<p>﹁您住南屋嗎？﹂</p>
<p>聲音是挺重濁的，有山西味兒：﹁是啦，你昨天搬來？也好，這院子是靜得鬼都快敢住了。﹂</p>
<p>﹁昨晚聽見您咳嗽，以爲是狐仙來了呢﹂。</p>
<p>他哈哈了起來，捋着一把銀灰的雨天的天空一樣的鬍鬚。接着問了我的籟貫和學校，不勝爲離家的人唏嘘似的。因爲同樣是浪在外面，便稔熟得更快了。</p>
<p>﹁我有一個你這樣大的外孫女哩！﹂</p>
<p>於是，我多了一個口頭上的爺爺。</p>
<p>這老頭子慣愛講一些身前身後的瑣事以及他的死去了的事跡，這在他都是寶貴得如同自已的生命一樣，原也是，那些拖過了的生命的深痕呵！</p>

<p>老人是靠着女兒每月的一點津貼磨着日子，自己眼也散光了，手脚不時地要起痙孿。天晴的日子便搬個小板凳坐在北面那塊蕪雜的空地上晒太陽，守着黑猫的瞳孔的光綫爬進屋裏在一隻小爐子上預備自個的飯。有時候待我放學回家，老人笑吟吟地捧出一張烙餅或半個窩頭來，我誇着他的手藝好時他便高興了。</p>

<p>有時候我便跑到老人屋裏和他聊一聊，喝一杯他那泥茶壺裏的淡茶，他是非常高興有個天南地北胡扯的機會，有好多回，他柔聲呵斥我的好搬家的脾氣。</p>
<p>﹁住下去吧，不是很得味兒的？﹂</p>
<p>我也馴順起來：</p>
<p>﹁好，住下去，老伙伴丨丨不，是爺爺。﹂</p>
<h3 id="c320">沈默 <a href="#c320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭光漢</p>
<p>生爲現代人，大槪多少　知道一些沈默的好處，然而却很少人能够黽勉執行它。智慧的以色列王蘇羅門（Ｓolomon）在距今十世紀前說過一句﹁聰明人的嘴是藏在他心裏，愚人的心纔是掛在他嘴上﹂的話丨這句話確是很耐咀嚼的。有許多人就時常看到一些别人看得頗爲順眼而自己偏偏看不過眼的事，結果自願破了﹁沈默﹂之誡，招來許多煩惱，照蘇羅門的話說來，無非都是些大傻瓜罷了。聰明人把嘴藏在心裏，固然没有什麽話可說；大家都没話說，一片昇平氣象，豈不是好？偏偏又出了些愚人，要把一顆心掛到嘴巴上來，呶呶不休，說了許多煞風景的話丨話雖則是說過，而且，也許說得十分響亮，可憐的是，這個世界却只好永遠失去了他們。</p>
<p>距今二千五百年前，希臘有一大哲人畢遠哥拉斯（Ｐytagoras）敎誨世人：﹁閉住你的嘴呵，不然就說些比沈默來得有價值些的話吧﹂。書獃子的話，初看上去似乎不無幾分道理，而細想起來，却也不免覺得獃氣：要辨别什麽話說得有價值，什麽話說得無價值，在目下已經就是一個够費力的問題了。人們的話當眞說得一些價值也没有麽？我想，他們地下有知，當也不會首肯。　　　聖經不歌頌那些﹁力能拔城﹂（Ｔakethacity）的勇士，却讚美那些能﹁管束自己的感情﹂（Ｒulethhisownspirjt）的聰明人，這是不無理由的。世上儘有許多話說出來呌人﹁心誠悅服﹂，然而他們却不去說它，情願留着給聰明人去說，自己偏愛說些﹁自尋苦吃﹂的話。不管歷史上産生過多少諸如此類的可悲的事實，人們依然不知警惕，依然情願爲了多嘴而忍受磨折，甚而至以身殉。我驚奇着這世界何以有這許多﹁愚人。﹂</p>
<p>午夜夢回，想起兩三年前幾個朝夕聚首的朋友，如今有的已是人神異路，有的是死生不明的流浪在各處、不禁欷歔再三。聖佛蘭西斯（ＳtＦrancis）說過一句﹁與其﹁不幽默﹂的說出眞理，還不如沈默的好，否則豈非等於在一碟好菜上澆上了惡劣的醬油﹂。現在有許多聰明人已經學會了避開眞實的正面，專門從側面做文章，旣可避去嫌疑，又可呌讀者發發鬆，實是聰明之至。只可惜有些人旣不能緘默，又不諳加上那碟﹁醬油﹂之道，奈何？奈何？</p>

<p>— 莫輕</p>
<p>呵，這些日子以來，我實在太疲倦，太衰弱了！我涉過了千萬里路的水程，落宿過無數的陌生友人之家。我曾有過終宵的驚恐不眠之夜。我也曾有過整日如同有無數萬針在剌着腦子的白天。我更長有着永遠做不完的終日手足不停聲嘶力歇的工作。唉，這衰弱的神經，這疲　的身軀，不也都需要有一些子休息嗎？是時候了，爲什麽不讓我安靜的睡一刻兒，僅僅一刻兒也好。</p>
<p>昨天淸晨，我曾偷閑地跑到法國公園去。站在傍呂班路口那高聳的亭子之　，依着欄杆痴立了良久。不算很疏的滿園法國梧桐之叢林，枝梢頭的大葉已將落盡了。沿溪一帶的白楊，有幾根經得起的，還剩有瘦長枯黄的柳條。冷風吹過，，怕無論什麽硬心腸的人，也會經不起悄然有感吧！溪中的水流，被扇起了悠悠的漣漪，一直通過橋去。湖裏是緊鎖了一征皺紋，更是悲愁難解。早上的遊客又很寥落。呵！這滿園簫簫的疏林，這滿園飛飄的落葉，這滿園哀愁的水面，傍着那從山巓跌下來的流泉的嗚咽，眞是足够斷腸了呀。這情景，使我驀地憶起了黄鶴樓頭，蛇山頂上的許多舊事。呵，我怕得去深思，我也更怕得久睹！</p>
<p>我把視綫移向那渺茫糢糊的天際，接連躍入我眼　的是那些十餘層，數十層的失形的，圓形的以及方形的建築。呵，我方才明白，如今我已漂泊到這東亞最大的都會裏來了。呵，你瞧：這天空中佈滿了的粗黑綫條，這地面接連狂奔着的文明之怪物。這些送波綫的高壓電流，這些球形的軸輪，這些金屬作成的雷雨。這一切電的車輛，汽的車輛，都是在亂動呀，也是在搏鬥。呵這是力的表現，機械的表現，硬朗朗的鋼鐵的表現。我旣然是處身在這種緊張的尖銳的環境之中，又豈容我那末脆弱地抽出身來，站在一邊尋愁發感的嗎？呵，我要是不能捲起兩隻袖子，憤然跳進這力的搏鬥之羣裏去學習磨鍜。那末，風浪偶然一來，還怕我不輾成肉餅嗎？</p>
<p>然而，今夜，可怕的傷感，又鑽進我的心頭來了！呵，我的身體已感覺了不可遏止的寒冷，我的肚皮也感覺了無可耐受的飢餓，我要是再不能變得更堅硬一點呀！我給你說：我要捲起袖子，大踏步跳進去，跳進那硬朗朗的力的搏鬥之羣裏去了。呵，你這可怕的傷感。你這醜惡的傷感，請給我滾吧！一個筋斗，從此永遠給我滾去！</p>

<p>他决心坐個整晚，當作一種懺悔，那張電報紙上，祇是簡單地說：﹁奥斐麗亞病危﹂，他想，在這種情形下面，要是還跑到臥車裏去睡覺，那是太不近人情了，所以當夜色　掩了法國的時候，他還在頭等車廂裏疲乏地坐着。</p>
<p>當然，他是早就應該坐在奥斐麗亞的床邊的，可是奥斐麗亞不要他，所以現在他在車箱裏坐着。</p>
<p>在他心的深處，有一塊黑色的笨重的重量：像是什麽孕滿了絶對黑暗的毒瘤似的，在把他的心臟直牽下去，他是什麽時候都把人生看得很嚴肅的，現在嚴肅把他壓倒了，他的　黑的，漂亮的，刮得光光的臉孔，和那對深憂的斜掛着的濃黑眉毛，眞可以去做那十字架上的基督像了。</p>
<p>車中的夜，眞像是一個地獄：没一樣東西是眞實的。他對面的兩個英國老太婆早就死了。或許在他死前她們早就死掉了，因爲，當然，他把他自已是當作死了的。</p>

<h3 id="c324">解脫苦悶還是解脫自己 <a href="#c324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>靑年的﹁時代病﹂丨苦悶，在七號本刊炳君發表了他新的見地。炳君謂有大部份的靑年，他們所有的苦悶，其來源並非由於﹁舉世的紛擾，社會的黑暗，人情的陷落﹂，因爲他們到社會混了若干時，也覺得無所謂了。可是苦悶仍罩着他們的心，因之需要自身上來求解答。而補救的合理方法，則炳君就引了袁中郎的話來作結論，說須要精神有所寄托，﹁以奕爲寄，以色爲寄，以技爲寄，以文爲寄﹂。</p>
<p>中國有一種傳統的思想，一到了天下紛紛的時候，就想去尋求桃源勝地。陶淵明的﹁田園將蕪胡不歸﹂，諸葛亮的在臥龍崗作散淡的人，均屬於這樣的﹁世人皆醉我獨醒，世人皆濁我獨淸﹂。如此笑傲風月，飲酒賦詩，果然也是千古逸事，宇宙垂名。</p>
<p>這一種風氣，傳到現在還是一種﹁國粹﹂，因此在喊殺聲中，我們就發現了﹁吃苦茶種胡蔴﹂之類。但是﹁終年忙忙如有所失﹂的靑年太多，善於寄情的人們就抬出了袁中郎來，勸人寄情於奕色技文等，以昌盛世。彷彿這些東西，其能醫治靑年的苦悶病，竟似﹁百靈機﹂，有意想不到的效力。炳君之靑年苦悶解脫云云，卽秉乎此旨。</p>
<p>催眠術之能醫治疾病，在於能使人的神經麻痺：而寄情於奕色技文之能解脫靑年苦悶，乃在於精神有所寄托，二者實有異曲同工之妙。和尚尼姑隠者名士以及於袁中郎之值得羡慕贊美，意義大槪在此。不過炳君說寄情於奕色技文，﹁無不愉快的過着他們的生活，造詣來得格外高深﹂，否則終日愁眉不展苦過一世，嘗不到一點兒人生的甜蜜滋味，確實爲意想所不及。</p>
<p>不過不知道如果一般靑年都奉此爲規箴，在﹁寄情﹂於奕色技文使精神有所寄托而解脫苦悶之後，他們還要拉吃着住否，苦是仍然免不了時，在目前實在還是會使人﹁終日忙忙如有所失的﹂。情有所寄，便能愉快生活，造詣高深，實在太好太好：﹁無事而憂對景不樂﹂的苦悶，確乎﹁可憐可憐﹂，所以要實現這一想理，最好除精神有所寄托外，還要身體有所寄托，卽不再拉吃着住，解脫自已。</p>

<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>從許多賀年片堆中發現了一張紫羅蘭的小箋：</p>
<p>老友，我没有别的恭賀你，希望你今晚九時在大光明等我，你當然知道寫信的人的。</p>
<p>去年的今天，我同樣接到這樣一張紫羅蘭的小箋，上面僅是﹁恭賀新禧﹂四個字，從我糢糊的記憶中肯定是出於一人手筆，但是斷不定這位寫信者是朋友間的并玩笑，抑是所謂某一種的神秘事件？</p>
<p>被這個念頭盤據了，好像今天所遇見的朋友都是可疑的，尤其是當他們提起到大光明去瞧電影。相盡了種種方法來探測每一個嫌疑犯，但是没有結果。</p>
<p>到了晚上，預備閙一個大笑話到大光明去。</p>
<p>今晚觀衆特别擁擠。賣票櫃前面疊着成羣的人頭，爭先恐後，彷彿自己手中的錢換不到一張票似的。雖然有幾個悠閑地在門前徘徊，可是我碰不到一張熟識的面孔。</p>
<p>自己旣不一定要瞧電影，也懶得到賣票櫃前去比武了，遙望華安大厦的鐘，八點半剛敲過，就若無其事的在門前站了瞧着歡迎這新年來臨的人們。</p>
<p>雙手揷在衣袋裏，這樣佇立了十多分鐘，我的肩上被人拍了一下，旋過頭來，是一個不認識的女人，然而她却開口問我了：</p>
<p>﹁你知道約你等候的人嗎﹂？</p>
<p>﹁你是誰﹂</p>
<p>﹁收到我的信，就知道我是誰了﹂。</p>
<p>她得意地笑了起來，我纔記起她是中學裏的同學羅蘭，分手將近十年了。</p>
<p>﹁還是閙孩子脾氣﹂。緊緊握着手表示一種感激以上的熱情。</p>
<p>﹁這樣，比較有意思一點﹂。</p>
<p>到裏面，她告訴我午後已來賣了票，剛才來的時候，在你面前走過，看你好像不認識我的樣子，我就站在隔窗看你的行動，後來斷定是你，要是我再不招呼，倒是怪有趣的事。</p>
<p>坐在黑暗的電影院中，我們嚅嚅的談起别後情形來。</p>
<p>這裏得提一提的，在學校時候我們閙過戀愛，可是我失敗了。所以一談到婚姻問題，她就問我結婚没有？我俏皮地回答：</p>
<p>﹁我愛的女人都跑了！！你呢﹂？</p>
<p>﹁我愛的男人都跑了﹂！</p>
<p>我們輕聲地笑着，彷彿拉回到十年前學生時代一般快樂着。</p>
<p>散塲出來，我們不捨卽刻分離，在人行道上慢步，雖然是冬天，迎面拂來的風並不覺得寒冷，我忽然想起了去年的一個賀年片，對她說了。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>﹁誰說不是我寄的﹂？她回答。</p>
<p>﹁你怎能知道我在那個公司呢﹂？</p>
<p>﹁你翻過我們校裏畢業同學錄嗎﹂？</p>
<p>﹁那末，又怎想起這個跑了的男人呢﹂？</p>
<p>﹁這没有什麽關係，偶然想起罷了﹂。</p>
<p>這樣分了手</p>
<p>下一天，又發現了那張紫羅蘭的小箋：</p>
<p>老友，你認爲這眞是偶然的事嗎？我希望你再鼓起從前失敗時的勇氣來，這一次的勝利是非君莫屬的！</p>

<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>夏村的義大嫂，誰都知道她是新婚的寡婦，她那美麗的面貌，她那温雅的風姿和悅人的微笑，没有不惹人注視的讚美，人人都說：義媽好福氣，討了這麽一個艶媳婦。</p>
<p>太陽照曬着和平的村落，他們都逍遙自在的過活着，但近幾年來，好像萬事倒逆，加之什麽開仗，拉夫，這些事情在單純的，英勇的少年阿義聽來並不在乎似的，他慢慢然的大步跨走上前去，於是他的影子就遠遠的從此消逝，永不回頭向他新婚月餘的妻子告别了。</p>
<p>一日兩日，一月兩月，她們仍舊等不着阿義歸來。</p>
<p>黄昏的時候，她靜悄悄的踱出城門，立在德溪的邊頭，遼望着遠遠的迎面蕩漾的小舟，她想：﹁這也許就是他？﹂然而這小舟却毫不經意地在她面前駛過了。義大嫂的心漸漸的灰暗起來，因爲不止是今天，她的失望是月積年來了。　　　　每當早起，她還記得丈夫的怪脾氣，先用早膳後洗牙，先戴帽子後穿衣，現在呢，什麽都空虚，冷靜。她那悅人的微笑，再不會在她臉上流露了，偶然她想討婆婆的歡喜，她免强的笑了，可是倒引起義媽的怨恨，咒咀，什麽一尅夫精，吃人的妖怪，枉了你長得眉目超人······﹂這些都給義大嫂聽慣了。</p>
<p>帶着創痕憔悴的義大嫂，扶着悶慮的神態，手携小竹籃，跟着陽光初上，她走到早上的市塲，買了婆婆要吃的小鯽魚，還有些别的瓜菜。幾個月來，她已經成了習慣，義媽没有起身的時候，她携着菜籃子回來了。</p>
<p>義媽說：﹁爲什麽偏要買這小鯽魚呢？賣魚的人跟你有緣嗎？唔······﹂</p>
<p>一婆婆不要吃這個，明天買别的好了﹂。義大嫂維恭維愼的回答。</p>
<p>這時候，小猪跑進來說；</p>
<p>﹁義媽！義媽！市塲的夏三伯剛才走過這邊，他問你在不在家？家裏還有什麽人呢？我告訴他，你是常常在家的，他就不作聲的跑開了。﹂</p>
<p>小猪是個不懂事的孩子，住在義媽隔壁，他最喜歡替義媽帶來外間的消息，這回他也是照平日的心理告訴了她夏三伯的話。可知道義媽已經射出兇燄的視綫打量着義大嫂的身上，緊促着呼吸，站了起來，呆重的敲着檯子，大聲的喊：﹁好！你······，不要臉的東西，併頭來找你了，去吧！吃人祖宗的妖精，你不要這樣兒敗壞了我的家聲！滾你的吧！﹂</p>
<p>義大嫂正想開口伸說，婆婆卽大聲叱着！辯什麽？﹂</p>
<p>一直到第二天早上，她没有作聲，義媽也仍舊聽不到媳婦的聲息，她疑心她是向自己淘氣，可是事實告訴了她，義大嫂的身體已經現在井面了。</p>

<p>淡淡的太陽斜照在山坡下，阿七公公坐在門前一塊靑石上有一口没一口的抽着旱烟，他儘把一對老花了的眼睛瞇着，彷彿在沉思些什麽；幾根花白的鬍鬚上掛着兩顆黄豆般大的淸水鼻涕。</p>
<p>﹁乒！乓！﹂一羣孩子在曠塲上燃放小爆丈玩，他們都穿着紅紅綠綠的新衣服，嘻嘻哈哈的笑着跳着；周遭是洋溢着快樂的空氣。他的孫子玉兒也在裏邊，但是不曾穿的新衣，身上還是一件日常穿的，堆滿了骯髒的破絮襖。</p>
<p>！孩子時代的新年是多麽快樂呵！然而一到了中年，尤其是老年時代，每逢到佳節或新年，不但索然無味，並且有時會引起人們的感傷和流涙！</p>
<p>他想着想着，看着這一淘快樂的小天使，便不覺想起了自己的童年，和他兒子阿金的童年來了。丨自己的童年，那正是他父親顯赫鄉里的時候，所以豐衣足食，無憂無慮，家中僱兩個長工，和一個阿媽，他父親啣了一支旱烟管，拖了一根小辫子踱出門去，人家總呌他一聲二老爺的。到了他兒子阿金的童年，那就不如往昔了！家裏雖不至愁吃愁穿，可是倒底一天不做一天不下，不像他父親手里，吃的米有人送租米來，用的錢也有人送上門來了。到了現在，那更糟了；天災，人禍，接連地襲來，苛捐雜稅更不絶地增加。農村破産已到了尖端，一年的收成連大麥子玉蜀黍統統在内還吃不到接新。水災過去不久，接着又閙起匪災蝗災來，去年更來了一個旱災。呌我們窮人正没得命活！</p>
<p>他儘管這樣想，旱烟管里的火已熄了，然而他還是有一口没一口拚命的抽，抽得烟筒頭里吱吱·····的呌。</p>
<p>丨㗒！我活了七八十歲年紀了，像這種年頭眞還是第一次碰到；這樣的日子怎樣好過？我是活得够了，多活也不過糟塌糧草，倒是阿金的日子眞難過！年成是這樣荒歉，負擔却一天重似一天；别人家大年初一玩玩快樂，但是他今天依舊同往日一樣，隔晚到蘿蔔田里去挖了一擔蘿蔔來，今天一早又挑出去喊賣了。可是現在蘿蔔也不值錢，往年這一片蘿蔔田我們也好見十幾只洋啦，現在只賣得五錢一斤，挑出去一擔蘿蔔也換不到一升半米，呌我們一家五口子怎樣活命！</p>
<p>阿七公公正在這樣自言自語的慨嘆，五先生却興匆匆的從鎭上茶館裏喝了元寳茶回來，經過這里，看見阿七公公獨自個兒坐在那兒，就向他作了一個揖。</p>
<p>﹁恭喜發財！阿七公公茶也不去喝，大年初一一個人坐在家裏不寂寞嗎？﹂</p>
<p>﹁發財！你也發財！你一早從鎭上回來了？﹂阿七公公勉强機械地欠了一欠身。</p>
<p>﹁今年鎭上冷靜得很，一些也不像是個新年，我坐坐也没有興趣，賭塲也拉不攏，還是回去睡覺去。﹂</p>
<p>﹁啊！這樣的年頭，連肚子都裝不飽，還有什麽興緻過新年？﹂</p>
<p>﹁你不知道啦！聽說成泰，祥盛，等幾家店都關門了，恐怕還有幾爿不能開門呢！﹂五先生說着走了。</p>
<p>﹁没有人買東西，店自然也難開了！﹂阿七公公用着一副憂鬱的眼睛，望着五先生的背影没入了林子裏。</p>

<p>初冬的景象是形容不來的蕭條的啊！</p>
<p>每天，第天一淸早爲着生活的鞭韃從正熟睡了的好夢中跳醒，揉眼，洗臉，套上笨重的服裝，怱忙中溜出於三角形的那彷彿古希臘羅馬時代藝術家所居的多綫條的小屋子。</p>
<p>繼續着，繼續着被裝進於距城三十里外的工作塲，每天十二點鐘被開回去。</p>
<p>於不休息的長期的工作中，依着原來的意志負着笨重的十字架。</p>
<p>不曾哼一聲﹁累﹂，也莫有﹁哀怨﹂，幽嫻地跟着日子的大輪轉動，内心和表面同一的平靖。</p>
<p>一顆幽美的靈魂，一架高貴的富於吸引力的身材，彷彿那種生活是屆服了他，縱然他自己從未哼過一個﹁不服﹂。</p>
<p>偉大處便在於他的冷靜與瞑索的形態，那便是在我所見的人中少有的典型人物。</p>
<p>（人生是歡樂痛苦的交響曲，受大剌激能鎭靜是具有成事業的人！）</p>
<p>許多次曾爲着一點點小事内心空虚以致淪於消極的時候他老以那樣話語來勸勉我！</p>
<p>（女人没有事業的，中古今外你看到有幾多女偉人？）</p>
<p>話下深深地感喟着無限的凄傷。</p>
<p>（但，晨鷄在唱，太陽從東方升上來，這便是希望的光明啊！）</p>
<p>温存地一顆顆由曲綫的嘴唇溜出來。</p>
<p>（你了解我但你没有方法來完成吾的願望的，因此，我的空虚是支配於整個生命中。）</p>
<p>另外一雙含有感激的涙水從兩頰一直滾下去，她望一次那個勇於負十字架的人鎭靜的臉容，内心更受一番難以形容的愧恨與忐忑。</p>

<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（四）﹁明星制度﹂之由來與</p>
<p>在那個時候，我們說到﹁星﹂，祇知道是夜裏天上燦爛發光的東西。那個時候的小資本家，傾家蕩産的投資在一爿五分錢小電影館的，那裏想得到天上那些亮晶晶的東西，會在地上唱歌，跳舞，走路，吃飯呢？不差的，那時的舞台上，已經有了名伶，名角之類的東西。一般紳士貴婦們，都穿了禮服，披了黑大斃，戴了高帽子化了很大的價錢，去看茂第亞當，斐斯克夫人，愛德華蘇蓀等等。他們那裏想得到，這一般闊人不久會哄到小衖堂裏，化了五分錢，來看布幕上幢幢往來的人影呢？</p>
<p>那時在電影裏﹁活動的人﹂，是無足輕重的。他們還不及小電影館裏的放映機值錢。那時的製作家丨丨實在亦當不起什麽製作家的名稱丨丨隨便拉了誰就是誰，將他們放在鏡頭前面，叫他們這樣那樣，亦没有想到這些人將來會比攝影的機器還要值錢。那時有一個婦人，叫蔡樂德史密斯的，在坎拿大死了丈夫，窮得没有飯吃，他就帶了三個孩子去唱戲混飯吃。並且因爲唱戲養不活一家的人，那個大的女孩子，呌葛蘭第（Ｇlady）的，就跑到紐約向一影片公司（ＢiographＳudio）投效，想多賺幾個養家的錢。她那時用的名字，呌曼麗璧克馥。不想她後來竟全球聞名，婦孺皆知起來！</p>
<p>那個時候的影片公司，是聘請不到舞台上的名角的。一般舞台上的大人物，呌那種新發明的東西，是﹁罐頭戲劇﹂，而十分厭惡和賤視的。他們認爲在攝影塲工作，是件不名譽的事。一個舞台演員，要是不急於等錢用，他决不肯俯就那種事情的。就是他不得已，而不得不去拍影戲了，他還要鬼鬼祟祟，諱莫如深，不讓朋友們知道，恐怕被他們看輕。不過後來這些在布幕上活動的人，被觀衆們所發現了，他們的地位才漸漸重要起來。所以，從實質上說來，明星們，無論是嘉寶也好，克勞馥也好，赫本也好，梅蕙絲也好，都是觀衆們創造出來的。</p>
<p>活動電影初發明的時候，大家看了，祇要動，就覺得稀奇。但是到了後來，觀衆不能永遠單看人影能動就算數了。他們要看些比單獨的動作更有趣的東西。他們所發現的，還不是鏡頭的角度，攝影的技巧等等。他們所發現的，是影片裏的人物。起初你們是不知道那些演員的誰和誰的。後來你們漸漸打聽起來，那個拖着長髮捲的女郎（憂麗璧克馥）是誰。打聽的人，越來越多，到了最後，製作家才覺悟到影片裏人物的名字，亦是重要的。這就是﹁明星制度﹂（ＳtarＳystem）的開始了。</p>
<p>但是倔强的製作家，在他們發現人物的重要之後，還堅持了多少年，想除去那種制度。他們說導演的地位，比演員們重要得多。他們想將導演的名字宣傳起來。當然，一張影片的成功，導演們的功勞是不可磨滅的，但是不知如何，觀衆們堅持着要知道演員們的名字，而將導演的名字，放在可有可無之列了。製作家又想單宣傳電影的本事。他們用鉅欵購置文學上的名著，舞台上的傑作，並且聘請了有名的著作家，替他們編劇本。但是無論如何，你們觀衆們還是天天要求着，要曉得每一個重要演員的名字。製作家拗不過你們的。他們被你們征服了。到了一九一零年，明星制度就鼎盛起來了。一個一個大演員，都稱之爲﹁星﹂了（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c335">評﹁海上權威﹂ <a href="#c335" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e335" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">335</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>ＨereＣomestheＮavy</p>
<p>丨大光明</p>
<p>由於﹁海上權威﹂這一譯名看來，也許有人會以爲這是關於海上惡戰，﹁殺得鬼哭神嚎﹂而定下了霸權的示威作品。但這兒僅僅是藉着軍艦，飛船，告訴我們一個水兵的羅曼史，一個偶然，巧合的平庸故事。</p>
<p>工人賈斯於修理亞呂宋那號軍艦的船塢中，與該船一個下級軍官畢夫閙了口角，又爲了女人在跳舞競賽中，一塲决鬥，而失去了愛人。</p>
<p>他爲了要在女人，情敵面上爭口所謂﹁英雄氣﹂，就去投入海軍補充隊受軍事訓練，結果被派在情敵手下當水兵。</p>
<p>戲是從賈斯于偶然的機會中結識了少女羅珊，而她又恰巧是畢夫的妹妹，這一點上展開下去。閙了不少戀愛的糾紛。在賈斯厭惡這海軍生活的劇的情緒低落中，來一個射擊演習，砲樓中炸藥失火的所謂劇的危機。於是賈斯用着身子居然會撲滅了火警，由受傷，得獎，調換工作這些塲面，把戲轉移到氣球上去。</p>
<p>氣球正在下降，亞里朱那艦的水手們趕上去恊助時，突如其來的狂風大作，形成了這劇的高潮，並以賈斯冐死救了畢夫，得償其與特羅珊結婚的宿願作結。</p>
<p>這兒，編劇手法的欠妥是到處可見的，如以賈斯的恰巧被派在畢夫手下與特羅珊又是畢的妹妹這些算是作者爲了劇的展開，所苦心經營的偶然巧合爲前提，用狂風忽作，賈斯救畢夫作結，再加上火藥房失火，竟可用身體來撲滅，與氣球遇風就完全失去升降作用等，都是把不通的塲合作爲關鍵的。</p>
<p>製作者攝製的意義，大槪是在於以水兵們色情的生活，如跳舞，爲女人而决鬥，針梢等來穿揷在偉大的軍艦，嚴肅的軍紀，與驚險的氣球上，給觀衆換換口味而已。</p>
<p>導演ＬloydＢacon能把這劇本製成如映出的成績，倒頗足稱贊的。他以輕鬆的調子，明快的鏡頭，俏皮的對話，補救了不少編劇方面的缺點，如九十天軍事訓練的演出與水兵色情生活的描寫，擦砲，飛球，决鬥，結婚等塲面頗爲淸麗可愛。</p>
<p>攝影的角度與部位也很適當。</p>
<h3 id="c336">評﹁奪標奇案﹂ <a href="#c336" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e336" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">336</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＤeathＯntheＤiamond</p>
<p>丨南京</p>
<p>自然是觀衆們需要剌戟吧，所以美國電影作家盡量的在這方面找題材，這不是没有根據的。但是他們劇作者是怎樣選擇剌戟性的題材的呢？以前我們就看過不少以跑馬，賽拳，賽船爲背景的作品，現在又有了這將殺人偵探和賽棒球拼在一道的﹁奪標奇案﹂了。</p>
<p>﹁奪標奇案﹂在藝術的評價上，可以說除了所謂緊張的塲面之外，乃是没有什麽貴重東西可言的。</p>
<p>就故事的結構來說，不能不算是有着比較嚴密的技巧，這就是說，在故事的發展上比較的自然而緊凑，譬如說幾次的球員被殺，那種相當緊張的空氣，不能不是劇本所决定的。但是這無非僅僅是技術的賣弄而已，無内容，無原則的技術的誇張，對於觀衆們到底不能給與比較深刻印象的。</p>
<p>﹁奪標奇案﹂告訴我們一些什麽呢？一個棒球隊，因爲作爲賭徒們賭博的工具，於是隊員們相繼被殺，而殺人的兇手却是與隊長相處多年的老人，他因惑於金錢而被處於法。在主題上似乎是反對賽球作爲賭博的工具，還帶一些人情世故的味兒。可是關於前者，賽球和跑馬，回力球同一作用，乃是資本主義必然的現象，後者也是被决於私有經濟制度的，然而作者却不會從這一方面去說明的。整個的說，到底是平凡的作品而已。</p>

<p>— 火</p>
<p>······幾千年來的中國婦女，在封建的重壓之下，得不着解放，終日深囚在黑暗的家庭中：公婆的鐵蹄下，度着非人酌凄慘的生活。﹁空谷蘭﹂中的胡蝶，便是生活在這種家庭中，遭受着不幸的女子，當她新婚之夜一舉一動，皆爲那些豪門貴族的遺老門所護笑，以致於造成了種種的悲劇，這是一部倫理的也是家庭問題的影片。</p>
<p>······嚴月閒一向在影片中是演反派的，這次在﹁空谷蘭﹂中也不能例外，當她溺愛自己的兒子，虐待丈夫前妻所生的孩子時，那副險惡的表情可演得淋漓盡致，這繼母的罪惡感動得胡蝶涙如雨下，當然這是﹁空谷蘭﹂中成功鏡頭之一。</p>

<p>— 信之</p>
<p>自從丹奥立佛逃走之後，久久未能緝獲。警察方面，雖偵騎四出，但終不得綫索，無從加以逮捕。一天早晨，瓊正在家裏讀着報紙，忽然聽見門外有人走過來。她抬頭一看，看見那進來的，正是那從前在法庭裏所見過的，那個衣服襤褸，形容枯槁的婦人。她見了瓊就問道：﹁你是瓊密契爾嗎？我就丹奥立佛的女人，叫曼麗梅洛利。我來······是來告訴你，奥立立佛並不是有意要打康登隊長的。他實在無路可走了，急了。我還要告訴你，奥立佛並不至於像快報說得他那末壞。她不過是意志薄弱些。但是自從快報宣佈了他的事情之後，他就没有自新之路了﹂。曼麗於是將以前一切的事情，都講給瓊聽了，她的怎樣帮他奮鬥，靜待着他還淸他的虧空。最後，瓊才打聽出來，曼麗已經是一錢不名，住所都没有了。瓊很佩服她，對於奥立佛那樣忠心，她於是告訴曼麗，要替她先尋一個安身之處。曼麗起先不答應，但是瓊堅持着，一定要帮她的忙。</p>
<p>曼麗走了之後，瓊就出去替曼麗尋找房子。她並見請了亞塞爾來帮她的忙。後來他們尋到了一所很合適的房子。付了房錢，告訴房東太太，說是替一位朋友賃的，並且向房東太太，要了鑰匙，就寫明了地址，派人送到給曼麗的老地方去了。可是房東太太心裏不相信瓊所說的話，說是替一位朋友賃的。瓊還忙着，替曼麗買了許多吃的用的東西，堆在屋子裏，忙到黄昏的時候，才忙完。亞塞爾已是不耐煩的，連聲催着瓊回去。不想他們正要離開那地方的時候，外面忽然有人敲着門。瓊開門一看，那站在門口的，不是曼麗，而是丹奥立佛。奥立佛先跑到曼麗的老地方，去尋她。曼麗告訴他，密契爾的女兒怎樣義氣，肯帮她的忙，並且已經尋到房子，將鑰匙送給了她。奥立佛聽了，懷疑起來，就親自來看看，到底怎麽回事。他看見了瓊，劈頭就問道：﹁你們到底玩的什麽把戲？我告訴你！你們不要想損害曼麗奥立佛﹂！瓊說道：﹁我們不過想帮她的忙。我並且已經答應了她，今天晚上替她和我的父親說去﹂。奥立佛咬牙切齒地道：﹁噢，不錯的。你們一窩裏，出不了兩樣東西。你今天晚上，和你父親說了，就派人來捉曼麗，是不是？她吧，你休想逃得過去！﹂他說着，伸出拳來，一拳就將瓊打倒在地下了亞塞爾立去跳了上去，可是奥立佛已經掏出槍來，對準了亞塞爾的胸口，鏜的一聲，亞塞爾倒在地下死了。奥立佛瘋痴似地狂笑了一下，將槍塞在躺在地下，人事不知的瓊的乎裏就逃走了。</p>
<p>直到明天黎明的時候，瓊才悠然蘇醒過來。可是她看了四週的情形，她又差一點暈過去了。她自已手裏抓着一支槍，亞塞爾死在她的身旁。她頭痛如絞，但是竭力掙扎着，跑到電話旁邊，打了一個電話給泰萊康登。一回兒，康登坐了一輛警車來了。瓊看見了他，就伏在他的肩膀上，將她所能記憶的事，斷斷續續地和康登說了。她祗記得奥立佛突然走了進來，他恐嚇她，後來她醒了，亞塞爾已經死在她的身旁了。她說完了，就叫康登送她回家去。可是康登的臉色鐵靑着說道：﹁瓊！我不能送你回家了。在法律之下，並且按照一切的證據，我不得不拘留你，你犯了謀殺的嫌疑了。﹂（未完）</p>

<p>Whether it violates international treaties</p>
<p>But the State Department is cautious</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator King today requested the Senate to investigate Japan's Manchurian policy, which is tantamount to throwing a bomb into the Senate. Senator King suddenly put forward the following three proposals:</p>
<p>The first proposal requests the Senate to investigate whether Japan's policy in Manchuria violates the Kellogg-Briand Pact or the Nine-Power Treaty. The second proposal requests the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to investigate the establishment of "Manchukuo" and its implementation of the petroleum monopoly, which undermines the open-door policy.</p>
<p>The third proposal requests the Foreign Relations Committee to investigate whether Japan is deploying troops on the former German islands mandated by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>It is understood that the three proposals were submitted without the support or approval of the government or Senate leaders. When reporters inquired with the State Department, they learned that officials may oppose the vote on such bills. (National Telegram of the 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator King today proposed in the Senate to investigate and determine whether Japan has violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which prohibits war as an instrument of national policy, or the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees the political independence and territorial integrity of China. King himself is not a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but he suggested that this investigation should be led by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. King's proposal is in the form of a motion, and if this motion is passed, it would be tantamount to trying Japan for violating the two international treaties. King also requested an investigation into Japan's establishment of defense works on the Pacific Islands under its control. (Reuters Telegram of the 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Senator King submitted a proposal to the Senate on January 7th, requesting a review of whether Japan's Manchurian policy violates the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, as well as a review of Japan's construction of defense projects on the Pacific Islands under mandate. It is reported that the two proposals have been submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for review. The contents of the two proposals are summarized as follows: (1) Since the contracting parties to the Kellogg-Briand Pact solemnly declared that they condemned reliance on war as an instrument for resolving international disputes, and the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates respect for China's sovereignty and independence, territorial and administrative integrity, and not to take advantage of China's situation to seize special rights and reduce the interests of friendly countries, the various policies implemented by Japan in Manchuria, such as the establishment of the "Manchukuo" government, the establishment of petroleum monopoly, and the "Manchukuo's" refusal to open its doors to those who do not recognize the country as reported in the Japanese newspapers, are obviously in violation of the two treaties. It should be resolved to authorize the Foreign Relations Committee or a subcommittee authorized by the committee to review this issue to determine whether Japan's Manchurian policy violates the two treaties, and it is recommended that the authorized committee handle it during the 74th Congress. (2) The Paris Peace Conference granted Japan the right to govern the former German Pacific Islands. It has been repeatedly heard that Japan has violated the treaty by building defense projects on the islands. It should be resolved to authorize the Foreign Relations Committee to investigate whether this rumor is true and whether Japan is building fortifications on the islands, or whether the project has been completed, and report the results of the investigation and recommendations to the Senate as soon as possible.

<p>(Tianjin) The Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou branches of the Transit Bureau will open at 10:00 a.m. on the 10th. Huang Zigiu, along with assistant manager Cai Wangxiang and three clerks, as well as Yu Xianglin, Hu Xinfa, Li Jingyang, and others, arrived in Shanhaiguan at 7:15 a.m. this morning and has telegraphed the Hebei Postal Administration to arrange everything immediately. (Special Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Huang Zigiu has telegraphed friends in Shanghai and Hankou to find more than a dozen retired postal workers to replace him because the Transit Bureau will start handling parcel exchanges on February 1st and is short of staff. They are required to arrive in Tianjin before the 20th and be assigned to service in Gubei and Yu. (Special Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, many people went to various post offices in Tianjin to post mail to the Northeast. The post offices refused to accept the mail today because they received an order from the Postal Administration instructing them to come again on the 10th to post it. (Special Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Cao Jianting, the Chinese Postal Director of the Hebei Postal Administration, said that although the Transit Bureau has signed a contract, all internal organizations and procedures are modeled after the post office. However, whether there are any obstacles to handling matters is unpredictable. Whether there will be any problems with the simultaneous acceptance and transfer of exchange parcels on February 1st must be studied in fact. Therefore, it is currently a trial nature. If there are no difficulties after three or four months, the regulations and organizational plans can be determined. This postal district has notified all branches and sub-branches that the acceptance of mail for postal communication will be implemented uniformly on the 10th. The procedures for sending letters to outside the pass by ordinary, express, and registered mail are the same as before and do not need to be transferred through the Transit Bureau. The Transit Bureau is responsible for transferring the mail from outside the pass, stamping a special transfer stamp on the special stamps, and is responsible for checking for misposted or fake stamps. The exchange of parcels depends on the Transit Bureau for transfer due to procedural reasons, which is different from the method for letters. (Special Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The pseudo-country's newly manufactured stamps specifically for postal communication are divided into 2-cent, 4-cent, 8-cent, and 12-cent denominations. The pattern on the 2-cent and 8-cent stamps is a flower border with sorghum, with a blue flower background. The pattern on the 4-cent and 12-cent stamps is a flower border with Changbai Mountain as the background. The price is printed on the upper left and right corners, and the price is abbreviated in English on the lower left and right corners. The words "Post Office" are printed in the middle of the bottom. It is reported that the pseudo-organization has no words. The style and size are the same as our current stamps. The pseudo-Gubeikou Post Office will be renamed the Nanluanping Post Office starting on the 10th to show that it is different from our Gubeikou Post Office. The post office is under the jurisdiction of the Pseudo-Rehe Luanping County Post Office. (Special Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The transit bureaus in Yuguan and Gubeikou have been organized separately and are scheduled to open on the 10th. The branch manager and clerks of the Gubeikou Post Office have all arrived. The Peiping Post Office has increased the number of clerks and sent five people to Gubei to assist in handling the receipt and dispatch of mail because the staff there is insufficient.

<h3 id="e34">The European Situation After the Franco-Italian Agreement is Established <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Laval arrived in Rome. Just two days later, foreign news reported that the Franco-Italian agreement had been concluded. The speed of its success is truly astonishing. However, the desire for France and Italy to join hands has been long-standing. According to Barthou's plan, he originally wanted to gather all the countries of Europe to seek France's security. Therefore, before King Alexander of Yugoslavia visited France, he had already started his movement to connect with Italy. Since the Marseille tragedy, Laval has followed the old path, doing his best to eliminate the gap between Yugoslavia and Italy, and striving for Franco-Italian cooperation. Secret negotiations have been going on for more than a day. It was not until the overall situation was settled that he went to Rome. The preparations beforehand were so long, and the conversations between the two sides were so secret. It is appropriate that the great cause was completed immediately upon arrival in Rome. We deeply admire the agility of French diplomatic skills here. France and Italy have long harbored deep suspicions. If negotiations were conducted in a straightforward manner, it would inevitably lead to a deadlock. The failure of Hitler and Mussolini's meeting last summer is a clear proof. Therefore, the French have always adopted the form of secret negotiations for this difficult problem that they have little grasp of. They must wait until the content is completely determined and unchanged before making formal visits and signing agreements. In this way, if the negotiations are not settled, they can continue. If it fails in the end, it can also be terminated invisibly. It is flexible and does not stick to formalities. It is appropriate that its success is beyond the expectations of the world.</p>
<p>According to foreign news reports, the agreement signed by the two countries includes three types: (1) regarding the redistribution of North African colonies; (2) regarding the Danube Convention and the guarantee of Austrian independence; (3) regarding European issues, the two countries consult each other. Although the detailed content is still unknown, it is not difficult to get a glimpse of it by observing these items and referring to the past relationship between the two countries. Please try to briefly explain it. This time, Franco-Italian cooperation is using North African colonies as bait on the French side. Its hope is that Italy will coordinate with France on European issues. There are several points that can be mentioned: (1) Italy's long-standing ambition for Yugoslavia may be completely abandoned from now on. Since the war, Italy has always intended to develop towards the Balkan Peninsula. Its target is always Yugoslavia. It can be seen from its protection of the Croatian terrorist party and its secret assistance to Hungary, which has the worst relationship with Yugoslavia. However, now that France has ceded considerable rights and interests in North Africa to Italy, foreign news also reports that the French have tacitly allowed Italy to have free action rights in Abyssinia. In this case, Italy's land ambition should be able to slightly change its focus. (2) The guarantee of Austrian independence, although a separate international convention will be signed, with Austria's neighboring countries jointly responsible, but in fact, France and Italy will inevitably bear this guarantee. There is no doubt about it. (3) The advocacy of treaty revision seems to have lost strong support from now on. Italy has always called on Central Europe to revise the treaty. Now, it cannot but slightly change its position by cooperating with France, which strongly advocates maintaining the European status quo. Since last summer, Italy's attitude towards treaty revision has become increasingly ambiguous. Until recently, people like Aloisi even said that "Italy's treaty revision theory has always advocated adopting legal forms." This is already obvious to cater to France's opinion. Today's Laval is also advocating non-violent treaty revision. In fact, non-violent treaty revision has already failed in the past. This proposition was originally created by Briand of France. In 1926, he brought Germany into the League of Nations, which was induced by this "peaceful treaty revision." However, I don't know that France occupies a great power in the Executive Yuan. How easy is peaceful treaty revision? Therefore, throughout Briand's life, the map of Europe has not changed. Italy witnessed and experienced this situation and knew the reason. Moreover, its previous saying about reorganizing the League of Nations was also issued for this purpose. It has not been long, so how can there be such forgetfulness? In fact, Mussolini is a practical politician. He only considers national interests and is unwilling to be bound by a theoretical proposition forever. (4) Slightly increase German military preparations and allow Germany to re-enter the League of Nations. The reason why the previous disarmament conference broke down was entirely due to the dispute between France and Germany over military preparations. However, judging from the requirements of all parties in January last year, the opinions were not too different. Germany asked for 300,000 people, while France allowed 200,000 people. The attitude of Britain and Italy was between these two disputes. Later, it was suspended because France requested international supervision of German military preparations as a condition. Now that France and Italy are combined, there is no need to worry about Germany. In this way, resuming negotiations according to the extent already discussed in the past seems to be a necessary step for stabilizing the European situation. In this case, the disarmament conference has hope of reopening.</p>
<p>However, the key to this matter lies entirely in Germany. Judging from the current situation, Germany has hidden dangers internally and no hope for development externally. Going on like this is not a good plan. The German authorities are well aware of this. Therefore, they are trying to ease relations with France. The previous remarks and actions of showing off force to the outside world are no longer seen. Hitler has also deleted the anti-French sentences in his autobiography. His desire to repair old friendships with other countries is clearly visible. Therefore, during this period, if all countries can preserve their faces and allow them to slightly increase their military preparations, it may not be impossible for Germany to re-enter the League of Nations.</p>

<p>France Cedes Over 10,000 Square Kilometers of Non-Territory</p>
<p>Austria and Neighboring Countries Sign a Non-Interference Pact</p>
<p>Changes to Military Preparations Will Be Consulted Mutually</p>
<p>(Rome) The main points of the Franco-Italian agreement signed in Rome yesterday have been announced in a communiqué, consisting of the following four parts:</p>
<p>(1) Treaty resolving the interests of both countries in Africa: France agrees to cede 114,000 square kilometers of land south of Italian Libya to Libya, and cede the coastline opposite the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait under the jurisdiction of French Somaliland to Italian Eritrea. Regarding the cancellation of the special privileges of Italian expatriates in French Tunisia, it is stipulated that those born in Tunisia after 1945 may choose their nationality. Italian schools in Tunisia will be legislatively managed by France from 1955.</p>
<p>(2) France and Italy jointly propose that all neighboring countries of Austria and Austria should mutually conclude an agreement of non-interference and non-aggression. France, Poland, and Romania may also join. The agreement allows for consultations with Austria if Austria's territorial integrity is threatened. This consultation method may be extended to other countries in the future to obtain their assistance.</p>
<p>(3) The two governments recognize that it is most appropriate to develop the economic relations between their countries and their African colonies, and specifically agree to take the necessary preparations to achieve this. Therefore, it is stipulated that Italy may participate in the railway operation rights from French Djibouti to Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the issue of equality of arms rights, the governments of France and Italy, based on the Anglo-American-French-German-Italian declaration of December 11, 1932, jointly recognize that no country may unilaterally change its obligations regarding arms. Regarding this issue, the two governments may consult each other when necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, the communiqué also stated that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval separately signed a declaration on general issues, stating that the pending issues between France and Italy have been resolved, and declaring that the two governments are willing to promote the traditional friendship between the two countries and cooperate in a spirit of mutual trust for construction undertakings. Finally, it stipulates that all issues should be consulted by the two governments if necessary due to the environment. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>

It also stated that the Rome agreement has caused a fundamental change in the situation in Central and Southeastern Europe. From then on, the competition and man-made hatred between the countries in the Danube River Basin and the Balkan Peninsula have no room for accommodation in Rome and Paris. The non-interference agreement has also been drafted into a preliminary treaty, forming a type of regulation in the Danube River Basin. All countries related to the situation in Central Europe are free to join. The newspaper concluded by saying, "I sincerely hope that Germany can join this agreement at the right time."

<p>Budapest: Political figures commented on the contents of the Franco-Italian agreement, especially pointing out that the communiqué issued in Rome yesterday contained a passage stipulating that Austria and its neighboring countries should mutually conclude an agreement of non-aggression and non-interference. Any country that attempts to interfere with the territorial integrity of the signatory countries by violence, then the other signatory countries should not approve of it. Political figures believe that Hungary has always advocated revising the treaty by peaceful means, which is in line with this provision. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>

Unexpectedly, Aishi advocated dissatisfaction, and the audience was greatly surprised by his words and held a reserved attitude. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>Budapest: The successive resignations of Finance Minister Yinle Di and Agriculture Minister De Karei are a major change in the Gongbos cabinet. It is reported that Interior Minister Feishi will also submit his resignation. Since the recent discussion of the dispute between Hungary and Yugoslavia by the League of Nations Executive Council, the Hungarian cabinet has encountered various difficulties. Former Prime Minister Petran once said that the advocacy of amending the treaty should not be taken too aggressively, and diplomatic efforts should seek more easily achievable goals. In addition, Prime Minister Gongbos's close relationship with the Small Farmers' Party, although enough to consolidate the cabinet's position in the parliament, makes the large landowners' party worry. The leader of the party, former Prime Minister Count Carroll, has been inactive in politics for many years, and now he is also out to activity. And the election reform and agricultural reform plan will be discussed by the parliament. Before the discussion, the senior personnel of the government and the army's financial departments suddenly changed, which is particularly unfavorable to the cabinet's position.

<h3 id="e40">Britain Hopes to Reconsider Disarmament <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(London) Since the news from Rome was published in various newspapers, British officials expect that disarmament talks can be reopened soon. When the disarmament talks are reopened, they will be based on the arms stabilization plan proposed by Italy in January 1934. However, the Italian plan advocates maintaining the status quo of armaments and preserving some combat weapons, which is contrary to Britain's policy of reducing armaments. Therefore, the British side feels very inconvenient. Currently, the situation is observed, depending on the results of French Foreign Minister Laval's visit to Britain. It is generally believed that whether France can participate in British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan depends on the degree of security guarantees obtained. If France believes that the Rome agreement is sufficient security guarantee, the British side still has to strive to implement the advocacy of reducing armaments. Whether the reduction of armaments can be implemented still depends on whether Germany can return to the League of Nations. In short, this issue will be discussed by Foreign Secretary Simon with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson before leaving for Geneva. Henderson will go to Geneva when the League of Nations Executive Council meets to consider the date of the next meeting of the Disarmament Conference Presidium. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(London) A cabinet meeting was held today, chaired by Prime Minister MacDonald, to discuss the arms issue. The cabinet believes that whether a general international agreement can be established depends entirely on whether the opinions of Britain and France can be consistent. Therefore, before the two countries jointly study it, they cannot make a decision hastily. As for the various international conventions that have been signed and are in progress, what new hope do they have for the issue of arms limitation? The British government intends to estimate it after consulting the French government before agreeing with Italy and Germany based on accurate principles to start negotiations. However, in the eyes of the British, if the disarmament plan proposed by Prime Minister MacDonald on March 16, 1933, can be reorganized according to the current situation, it will definitely be practical.

<p>(Paris) The Foreign Ministry today firmly denied that the Franco-Italian agreement signed yesterday contained a reservation for amending the treaty, and said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval did not involve the issue during their meeting in Rome. The Foreign Ministry also denied that France and Italy had concluded a protocol on German disarmament, but judging from the current situation, the two politicians seemed to have reached an oral compromise on this matter during their talks in Rome. The trend in France seems to be weighing the two evils and taking the lesser one. France means that instead of allowing the German National Defense Force to swell in secret indefinitely, it is better to set a limit for it. The semi-official Times now advocates this proposal, but also requires three conditions and guarantees, including (1) leaving room for the security of the French army, (2) Germany will no longer increase the National Defense Force, (3) Germany will return to Geneva. Rome is now very hopeful that Germany will express its agreement with the arms provisions in the Franco-Italian agreement. Today, political circles refused to explain the text of these provisions, but said that its wording must be accepted by Germany. The Italian authorities firmly denied that Italy or France intends to declare Germany's armaments illegal, and that it must wait until Germany has agreed with the great powers on the issue of arms before doing so.

<p>Saarbrücken: The Saar Regional Referendum Committee recently issued a communiqué to the Saar and foreign press, stating the procedure for the referendum on January 13. On that day, 550,000 voters will vote separately in 862 polling places. After the voting is completed, the ballot boxes from various places will be sent to the Wadburg Theatre to begin counting the ballots. During the counting of ballots, the Referendum Committee will preside over everything. In addition, representatives of the International Federation, representatives of the French, German, and Saar governments, judges of the Referendum Supreme Court, representatives of various political parties, foreign consuls, and journalists will be invited to the field to visit. It is expected that the final result of the vote will be announced on the morning of January 15. At the request of Havas, Referendum Committee Chairman Rode asked to study the proposal to announce it once every 100,000 votes are counted. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) About 5,000 German-American citizens living abroad are going to the Saar region to participate in the referendum. Dix, the chairman of the House Immigration Committee, a Democrat, recently introduced a bill advocating the revocation of the American citizenship of these citizens. Therefore, whether Americans who go to the Saar to vote can still maintain American citizenship has become a problem. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: About 400 German expatriates from the United States arrived here today to participate in the referendum conference. Many people from the "German Front" welcomed them at the station. Although the authorities prohibited political demonstrations, thousands of residents surrounded the German expatriates and sang the German national anthem. Mounted police maintained order and did not allow the public to stay. Although the welcome was very warm, one German expatriate claimed that he advocated voting for maintaining the status quo, and also said that the Saar people who live in the United States had prepared to return to vote before the German National Socialist Party took power. (Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: The initial voting of the Saar people's referendum has been held in various parts of the region yesterday and today, but the participation of the people is not enthusiastic. Very few employees of the Railway Bureau, government officials, and public officials can vote according to the scheduled date. It is said that this phenomenon is due to the failure of the authorities to prepare thoroughly, resulting in some people doubting that this first vote cannot be fully secret. (National News dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: The German Front is deeply afraid that the National Socialist Party's salute will lose tens of thousands of votes supporting Germany. Therefore, they are now trying their best to persuade members not to perform this salute or shout the slogan "Heil Hitler" when voting. Yesterday, five people violated the Saar Referendum Committee's recent order and saluted each other in the polling place, resulting in the loss of their voting qualifications. Another old woman claimed that she was born a German and would die a German. Her words meant that she would vote in favor of Saar's return to Germany, and she also lost her voting qualifications because of this. The German Front has filed a hospital discussion with the committee on these matters. At the same time, the authorities are now making thorough preparations to make the referendum completely free and secret. An external member is placed in charge of each polling place. The ballot boxes are guarded by international troops. It will not be until Monday morning that the Saar Management Committee, the Referendum Committee, the Saar people, the international troops, and representatives of the world's newspapers will start counting the ballots. The result will not be known until midnight on Monday. (Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: All parties earnestly requested to announce the results of the Saar people's voting on what day and time. The Voting Committee specially announced today that the committee is determined to do its best to announce the results of the voting simultaneously in Saarbrücken and Geneva on the night of January 14.

<p>(Moscow) After two trains collided on the Moscow-Leningrad railway trunk line last week, seven more people died from their injuries. The death toll has now reached twenty-three. The number of seriously injured has now been reduced to fifty-six. In addition, there are still some people with minor injuries. It is reported that the accident was caused by the negligence of some workers. For example, the driver of a train ignored the signal to stop, which can be used as evidence. At the same time, the stationmaster at the accident site has been arrested for leaving the station without permission after the accident. (Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Eighty-Year-Old Man Testifies with Cane in Lindbergh Kidnapping and Murder Case <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Flemington - The trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a German carpenter accused of kidnapping and murdering Charles Lindbergh Jr., has continued for five days. Today, an eighty-seven-year-old man named Hockemer, walked slowly with his cane to the stand to testify. His testimony was extremely unfavorable to the defendant. The old man spoke in a very low voice, claiming that on the night of March 1, 1932, he saw Hauptmann near the Lindbergh home. Hauptmann was in a car with a ladder inside. The old man pointed at Hauptmann and said, "This is the man." After speaking, he pressed his hand on Hauptmann's shoulder to show that his words were true. Hauptmann appeared calm when he entered the court, but turned pale upon this testimony, only slightly shaking his head to indicate his denial. Another witness, also unfavorable to the defendant, followed. This man, named Perrone, is a streetcar driver. Perrone testified that the defendant gave him one dollar and asked him to deliver a letter to Dr. Condon, who represented Lindbergh in negotiations with the kidnappers after the kidnapping. Perrone approached Hauptmann and placed his hand on his shoulder, saying, "This is the man who asked me to deliver the letter." The defendant's lawyer, Reilly, repeatedly cross-examined this witness, but could not shake his testimony. After leaving the court, Hauptmann told reporters that Perrone was a liar and that he did not know why he would give such testimony, stating he had never met Perrone until Perrone, accompanied by several police officers, entered the police station and falsely claimed to recognize him. The most notable piece of evidence presented in court today was a wooden ladder, said to be the one the kidnappers placed outside the window to enter the house and steal Lindbergh Jr. Fingerprint expert Kelly stated that no fingerprints were found in the Lindbergh house or on the ladder. The defendant's lawyer claimed that Reilly's method of searching for fingerprints had destroyed them, as Kelly used a brush to remove dirt instead of blowing powder. The ladder was disassembled and then reassembled, hence this evidence.</p>

<h3 id="e49">U.S. Treasury Secretary Announces No Change in Silver Purchase Plan, Rumors of Avoiding Raising Silver Prices in China Denied <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today dismissed as a rumor the speculation that the U.S. government, in carrying out its silver purchase program, intends to avoid raising silver prices in the Chinese market. Other Treasury officials told Reuters that the government's silver purchase program is no different from what was stated in the Sino-American exchange of notes in mid-October last year. The U.S. government remains determined to purchase silver on the world market. This policy has been stipulated by congressional legislation and cannot be changed by the executive branch. However, Secretary of State Hull has guaranteed that the United States is willing to avoid disrupting China's economy and finances as much as possible. Reuters has learned that Chinese Ambassador Shih Kung has frequently discussed this matter with Hull since the exchange of notes, but there has been no concrete development. Hull stated on Sunday that he was unaware of any new developments in the silver situation. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told the Associated Press today that the item of silver coinage profits in the government's next budget is of no noteworthy value and does not indicate any change in the silver purchase policy. The budget for the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1936, lists silver coinage profits at $11.5 million, while the figure for the current fiscal year is $10 million. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Conservative Faction Dominates U.S. Congress, Inflationary Policies Difficult to Implement <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) In the first week of Congress's session, conservative Democrats have been seen to dominate both houses, making the implementation of inflationary policies unlikely. Future silver and currency legislation will largely conform to the proposals of President Roosevelt and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Some compromises may be made if there is strong pressure from the silver bloc. All House leaders, such as Speaker Byrns, Majority Leader Pou, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Doughton, and Rules Committee Chairman O'Connor, are conservatives. In the Senate, besides Vice President Garner as the speaker, others such as Majority Leader Robinson, Banking and Currency Committee Chairman Glass, and Finance Committee Chairman Harrison are also conservatives. While the veterans' bonus issue is generally expected to pass, it remains doubtful whether its implementation will adopt inflationary methods as intended by the original proponents. Today, Representative Fish introduced a compromise bill proposing to pay the bonus in installments but suspend interest payments. If this bill passes, it would require an expenditure of $400 million annually for five years. Fish specifically stated that the payment of this bonus "should not involve increasing taxes or issuing more currency." (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury officials today began planning how to raise $9 billion to meet the needs of President Roosevelt's budget. In the next six months, expenditures are projected at $5 billion, while tax revenues and other income amount to only $1.9 billion, leaving a shortfall of $3.1 billion to be covered by borrowing. In addition, the government's maturing debt reaches $6,291,608,800, so the Treasury's new debt in the next six months may exceed $9 billion. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(New York) The revenue from silver coinage tax, as predicted in President Roosevelt's budget message to Congress, is now realized. The estimated revenue from the coinage tax in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1935, is $100 million, and in the 1936 fiscal year, it is $25 million. Therefore, the total revenue from this tax at the end of the 1936 fiscal year will be $125 million. However, this figure is not related to the silver purchase program. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) House silver bloc members organized today to promote the coinage of silver in this session of Congress. The group is not divided by party lines and is led by Representative Martin. Both Democratic and Republican members have joined. The House silver bloc plans to consult with Senate silver bloc leaders on cooperative measures, and it is understood that the size and influence of this new organization are superior to those of the silver bloc in the previous Congress. Martin criticized the Treasury's performance in silver purchases today, calling the current silver law like an adopted son of the Treasury. If the Treasury earnestly implemented this law, the price of silver would increase to one dollar per ounce, benefiting miners and inflating the currency. Martin expressed dissatisfaction with the handling of the silver issue and said that the United States currently feels a shortage of currency and relies too much on bank loans. It is said that reducing the gold content of the dollar should be tested by re-coining silver. He added that he personally favors re-coining silver at a ratio of sixteen to one for gold and silver, but silver bloc members have not yet reached a consensus. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) New Deal leaders expressed optimism today, saying that President Roosevelt's $4 billion public works plan could provide jobs for seven million people in 1935, of which 3.5 million would no longer receive government relief and would work for the Public Works Administration. The remaining 3.5 million could be employed by private factories, as commerce is expected to prosper after government encouragement. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Although the London Naval Conference recently ended without results, U.S. envoy Davis returned to the country today and declared that the London talks had laid the foundation for future agreements, and that an agreement between the U.S., Britain, and Japan might be reached this year. Japan's abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty should not be seen as the three countries immediately engaging in an arms race, as an arms race is truly unavoidable. In his report submitted to Secretary of State Hull, Davis expressed a conciliatory attitude toward Japan, saying that naval problems could still be solved if countries based their plans on not specifying naval ratios, and that this solution was in line with Britain's views. In principle, all signatory countries could achieve complete equality. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. representative Davis, returning from Europe, told President Roosevelt that if the spirit of international cooperation is promoted, an agreement on limiting land and naval armaments can be reached within two years. The outline of the British compromise proposal can serve as the best basis for the U.S., Britain, and Japan to limit their navies. The discussions in London have greatly clarified the atmosphere and laid the foundation for future compromise agreements. He expressed optimism about the possibility of a general disarmament agreement in Geneva being reached soon. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e52">Japan to Reply to Britain, U.S., and Netherlands on the Issue of the Monopoly of Petroleum in the Puppet State <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The governments of Britain, the U.S., and the Netherlands have submitted a third protest to the Japanese government regarding the petroleum issue through their respective ambassadors, requesting the Japanese government to provide a detailed explanation. Foreign Minister Hirota plans to issue a formal response to the three countries within this week, explaining that the petroleum monopoly in "Manchukuo" does not violate the principle of the Open Door Policy. (Domei, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The governments of Britain, the U.S., and the Netherlands have repeatedly protested to the Japanese government regarding the petroleum monopoly in "Manchukuo." From December 28th to 30th last year, a conference of British and American petroleum companies was held in Shanghai to discuss stopping the sale of British and American petroleum to "Manchukuo." According to information received by a certain office on the 9th, the attendees of the Shanghai petroleum conference were representatives of five petroleum companies: Socony-Vacuum, APC, Texaco, Morgan, and Baudier. The central issue of their discussion was countermeasures to the promotion of Soviet Russian petroleum in the Chinese "Manchukuo" market, aiming to seize the privileges of the Soviet Russian petroleum import merchant, Guanghua Company. They reached agreements on various issues, intending to request the Chinese government to abolish the privileges of Guanghua Company in the future and investigate the sales routes of Russian oil in Manchuria. The plan of the British and American companies to monopolize the petroleum market in the Far East is noteworthy. (Domei, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Takahashi Urges Cabinet Members to Pay Attention to Investment in Manchuria <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the cabinet meeting on the 8th, Finance Minister Takahashi reminded cabinet members to pay attention to and consider the issue of Manchurian expenses and private investment in Manchuria. This proposal by the Finance Minister aims to control investment in Manchuria and equalize the expenses of the Manchurian Incident. The expenses of the Manchurian Incident have occupied an important position in Japan's international borrowing. Originally, the expenses of the Manchurian Incident were to be equalized starting from the tenth year of Showa (1935) under the then Minister of the Army, Araki, but the budget for the tenth year was still 120 million yen. From this development, future imbalances in international payments will hinder exchange rate policies and have a negative impact on the economic sector. As a result of his concern, the Finance Minister took this action. (Domei, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that due to changes in Japanese trade and overseas situations, the future of the yen exchange rate will inevitably tend to fall. Therefore, it is suspending the purchase of foreign power bonds and sending cash payments to Manchuria, taking various measures to prevent this. Temporary overseas payments related to the government must also not put pressure on the exchange market. For example, the purchase of the Donglu requires paying 23 million yen in cash, and the result of employee retirement allowances is also to exchange foreign currency in the Japanese market. Therefore, it is asking the Yokohama Specie Bank to seek to increase its foreign currency reserves. Finance Minister Takahashi will invite the authorities of the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Japan in the next few days to discuss everything.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Shiying arrived in Nanjing on the 9th to participate in the Huangshan Construction Committee and handle the affairs of the Relief Association. He will return to Shanghai after meeting with President Wang. According to him, the disaster situation in various provinces last year was severe. After discussing with Finance Minister Kong in Shanghai, the Famine Relief Association of Various Provinces was organized in Shanghai and raised 1,025,000 yuan, which have been distributed to various provinces one after another. However, it is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. It is still necessary to continue raising relief funds. Since the 17th year of the Republic (1928), there has been a disaster every year, and every disaster has been severe. I have been in charge of relief affairs and have raised more than 50 million yuan in total. Given the economic panic in our country, it is extremely difficult. Fortunately, Finance Minister Kong has agreed to include the disaster relief reserve fund in the national annual budget from the 24th year of the Republic (1935) onwards. In the future, when relief funds arrive in Shanghai, they will no longer have to rely entirely on donations. (Central News Agency, 9th)</p>

<p>Yu Xianglin and Huang Zigufrom Tianjin Go to Yuguan</p>
<p>Huitong Transfer Bureau Established in Yuguan</p>
<p>Yu Xianglin, in charge of communications for Tianjin's postal service, and Huang Zigu, manager of the Huitong Transfer Bureau, along with more than ten staff members of the Transfer Bureau, took the Pinghu train to Tianjin early on the 5th. They met with Cao Jianting, the postmaster of the Hebei Postal Administration, at noon to negotiate a contract for the Huitong Transfer Bureau. In the evening, Cao Jianting hosted a banquet at the Penglai Spring in the French Concession to entertain Yu Huang and others. On the 6th, continued negotiations were held, and the contract was agreed upon. It is estimated that it can be signed on the 7th. The content of the contract is that the Transfer Bureau is responsible for transferring letters and remittances in the Hebei and Beiping postal districts. The validity period is one year, and it can be renewed after the expiry date. A deposit of 10,000 yuan is also paid. Huang is in Tianjin to handle this matter.</p>
<p>It is necessary to delay for a day or two. On the morning of the 8th, he went to Yuguan to prepare for the establishment of the Transfer Bureau. Another person was sent to arrange for Gubeikou. On the 10th, it is determined that the transfer of letters can be started as scheduled. Regarding this matter, according to Yu Xianglin, "I came to Tianjin to help Huang Zigu handle postal affairs, and I will follow Huang to Yuguan within days. After the Transfer Bureau is established, I will stay there for about two or three days and then return to Beiping to inspect Gubeikou, and then return to Beiping to contact the Ping Postal Administration. After everything is completed, I will return to my post as the postal director of Shanxi. The postal incident started before April. Gao Zongwu and I, as representatives of the General Post Office of the traffic sector on our side, contacted representatives of the Japanese Kwantung Army. This matter is only an agreement between our postal authorities and the Japanese Kwantung Army, and has absolutely nothing to do with our Ministry of Communications. Our country has never recognized the puppet state, and this principle will not be changed after the opening of postal services. In the future, domestic mail sent to the outside of the pass, all those marked with Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe and other provinces, will be transferred. If there are any words of a puppet organization, they will be prohibited from being posted." According to Huang Zigu, "I am scheduled to go to Yuguan within days to prepare for the establishment of the Huitong Transfer Bureau. When handling this matter, I heard that the postal issue had been decided, so I applied to the Hebei-Beiping Postal Administration as a retired postal worker to undertake postal and remittance matters inside and outside the pass, and set up the Huitong Transfer Bureau to take charge of it. The Hebei-Beiping Postal Administration approved my request because I am familiar with postal affairs. The only procedure between the two parties is to sign a contract and pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan. In the future, after the postal service is opened, the responsibility of the Transfer Bureau is only to transfer affairs. Letters entering the pass from outside the pass must be affixed with special stamps. The Transfer Bureau is responsible for compensating for the mis-posting of puppet country stamps. For all remittances inside and outside the pass, the Transfer Bureau will extract a 1% commission to be used as this compensation fee and the expenses of the entire bureau. Once things are in order and the mis-posting of fake tickets is reduced, the commission will be reduced as appropriate. The bureau is completely commercial in nature and is completely my personal business. As for employment, in addition to my appointment as manager of the Yuguan General Bureau, a supervisor is also appointed, followed by eight or nine clerks and several laborers. The Gubeikou Branch has one branch manager, two clerks, and several laborers. The contract can be signed tomorrow, and all the documents and equipment used are ready in Tianjin. The transfer of various items will be handled on the 10th."</p>
<p>According to inquiries, the Hebei Postal Administration has decided to send inspectors Hu Xinde and Li Jingxi to Yuguan with Huang Yu to monitor the establishment of the Transfer Bureau. However, there are still doubts here, that is, the issue of mail inspection. We do not discriminate against our compatriots in the occupied Northeast. The mail sent from them should also abolish the inspection procedures. Only the local bureaus at the place of delivery have inspectors stationed to pay attention to suspicious mail at any time. The puppet regime has always prevented our books and newspapers from entering the country. The inspection of letters is very strict to prevent secret communication with the volunteers. Now that the postal service is open, the Japanese side has not clearly proposed restrictions on our books and newspapers being mailed, nor has it set up special inspection agencies. Therefore, after the opening of postal services, the real restriction method is still not clear. Therefore, it is generally concluded that the postal service is open in name, but the inspection is still not abolished in substance. (6th)</p>
<h3 id="e124">Fujian Province Schedules Regular Pacification Meetings <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Remnant Bandits in Northern Fujian Defeated</p>
<p>Relief Situation in Western Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Jiang Dingwen, the Director of Pacification of Fujian, flew from Zhangzhou to the province on December 23 last year and stayed in the province for two weeks. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, he left the province for Xiamen and Zhangzhou with Chief of Staff Li Jianai. Jiang's two major missions this time were, first, to effectively link military and political affairs to handle post-recovery work, and second, to implement the pacification plan of divided defense in each pacification zone and the cooperation methods of various troops and local teams. After consultation and discussion by Director Jiang, Chairman Chen, and Chiefs of Staff Li and Yu, an implementation outline has been formulated. On the 2nd, Director Jiang and Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government had a final meeting, which did not end until after 2 pm. It is now scheduled that the Provincial Pacification Meeting will be held on the 10th of this month in the Zhangzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office. In addition to the four Pacification Commanders, Wei Lihuang, Liu Heding, Li Yannian, and Wang Jingjiu, each of whom will have proposals for clearing up scattered bandits and local post-affairs work, all military officers above the division commander of the troops formerly under the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression Army Headquarters will also attend. Song Yuanquan, the commander of the puppet Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region, who occupies the junction of Ninghua, Mingxi, and Qingliu counties, including Wucun, Quanshang, Shuixi, Fengxi, Tangchi, Anyuan and other areas, and the puppet independent 12th and 16th Independent Regiments, and the guard company training team, and other bandits with more than 2,000 people, were attacked by the 52nd Division Commander Lu Xingrong, who led his team to suppress them. From the middle of last month to the end of the year, the bandits were defeated. The bandit Song led more than 1,000 remnants to retreat to Guangchang and Shicheng. Local order is gradually being restored. The 52nd Division is now convening teams to carry out a thorough investigation. Lu Xingrong will first lead his team back to Ningcheng after the search near Anyuan is completed to discuss the Qingxiang with the county magistrate.</p>
<p>The relief issue in the recovered area of western Fujian has been handled by Kang Shaozhou, a consultant of the Provincial Relief Council, who has established a resident office in Changting and started working on January 4. The relief policy is also planned as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of medical treatment for the people, two medical teams for the people in western Fujian will be formed. All expenses will be paid by the Department of Civil Affairs on a monthly basis, and the Provincial Relief Council will supply the consumption of medicines. (2) Regarding the issue of work relief, Changting's production is mainly paper, with annual exports of no less than 5 million yuan. The cloth used by the people of the whole county is produced by local cloth factories. When the Communist bandits occupied the towns, the paper factories and cloth factories were destroyed. Since the recovery, the operators have mostly been unable to recover. It is decided that the Council will lend capital to help unemployed workers. Regarding the issue of agricultural relief, after Changting was occupied by bandits, farming tools were confiscated and cattle were slaughtered, resulting in difficulties for refugees returning to their hometowns due to the lack of cattle and tools. It is now decided that the Council will buy cattle and tools and borrow seeds to provide for cultivation. (4) Regarding the issue of emergency relief, in addition to providing fundamental relief to agriculture and industry, there are also unemployed people. It is decided that the Council will establish a poverty-stricken people's loan office to lend a small amount of capital to maintain the lives of several people. The rest of the widows, widowers, orphans, and the lonely will be provided with food rations on a daily basis by the Council establishing several porridge factories to avoid starvation. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e125">The First Phase of Conscription in Jiangxi Province Have All Joined the Army <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Security Teams to be Eliminated</p>
<p>Supplemented by Conscription in Succession</p>
<p>Nanchang Communications: In order to realize national conscription, Jiangxi Province began conscription in the 24th year, and the details have been recorded in previous reports. The first phase of conscription was 32 regiments, about 40,000 people. This quota of troops was conscripted from strong men aged 21 to 24 in each county and decided by lottery. Since the establishment of the Provincial Government's Higher Conscription Committee last year to supervise the holding of the Conscription Committee in each county, all procedures were completed by the end of last year, and the strong men in various places had also been drawn out early. According to news from Linchuan and other counties, all conscripted recruits reported to the county government on New Year's Day and joined the army, which was quite enthusiastic. More than 90 officers who have completed training by the Provincial Security Headquarters are serving as middle-level cadres and are being trained in teams by region to become an elite force. However, the Conscription Law stipulates that the active service is six months. After this period expires, another period will be conscripted until all the strong men in the province have completed military service. The existing security teams in each county are mostly recruited, and it has been decided to eliminate them in stages and replace them with conscripts in succession. (6th)</p>

<p>The Highway Administration Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction originally scheduled to hold a joint opening ceremony of the Jiangnan Highway on October 10 last year, but it could not be implemented due to the temporary lack of preparation and the unfinished construction of highways such as the Xihu Highway. Now, Chairman Jiang has ordered the construction authorities of the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing and Shanghai to complete the highway construction quickly. After receiving the order, Shen Baixian, the director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, has transferred the order to the Highway Administration Office to complete the trunk and branch lines of the Jiangnan Highway by the end of March and plans to officially hold the joint opening ceremony of the Jiangnan Highway on April 1. The route passes through Wuxi, Jiangyin, Wujin, Zhenjiang, Jurong, Nanjing, Liyang, Yixing, and returns to Wuxi, and then passes through Changshu, Wujiang, Jiaxing, Pinghu, Zhapu, Shanghai, Liuhang, Baoshan, Wusong, the city center, and then to Zhabei Baoshan Road for dispersal. The long-distance bus stations in each place along the way are responsible for supplying oil and water and providing relief, and the military police stationed in the area are responsible for protection. The vehicles are participated in by various long-distance bus companies. The bridges and culverts of the entire Xihu Road are still under construction and are expected to be completed in March.</p>

<p>In Pujiatan, a rural area of Dongbang Town, a geomancer named Pu Hansheng usually led a decent life. His household included his 76-year-old adoptive mother.

<h3 id="e135">A Review of the World Economy in 1934 by Mu Ouchu <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>There are two different observations of the state of the world economy in 1934: pessimistic and optimistic. The former is due to the fact that the overall world trade is still extremely depressed, and it is not daring to speak of recovery and prosperity. The latter is due to the fact that the domestic economies of various countries have partially recovered. However, in reality, did the world economy in 1934 get rid of the panic that had been worsening for several years and gradually enter a state of prosperity? We believe that the greatest characteristic of the world economy in 1934 was that all countries consistently pursued economic nationalism. Economic nationalism, strictly speaking, is fully colored by isolationism. Because of the prohibition of imports and the promotion of exports, it may appear to have partially recovered in the eyes of various countries, but in the view of the entire world, economic recovery is still in a state of uncertainty. Moreover, the content of economic recovery in various countries is entirely the result of developing military industries and implementing inflationary policies. And both of these are preparations for dealing with war. Therefore, we believe that the current popularity of economic nationalism and the partial recovery of the domestic economy actually contain the crisis of the outbreak of the Second World War. The actual situation of the world economy in 1934 tells us that all the materials are not optimistic. Now, we will try to divide the status into industry, agriculture, finance, the struggle for markets, and unemployment, and make a brief narrative as follows.</p>
<p>According to the League of Nations' report on the world economy, the world's total production in 1934 was on the rise. In April 1934, it not only recovered 95.5% of that of 1928, but also increased significantly compared to 83.2% in 1933.</p>
<p>Development of World Industrial Production (According to the Berlin Institute for Economic Research, 1928 = 100)</p>
<p>Average monthly in 1933 83.2</p>
<p>1934 January 88.7</p>
<p>February 91.0</p>
<p>March 94.5</p>
<p>April 95.5</p>
<p>May 94.1</p>
<p>June 92.8</p>
<p>July 88.8</p>
<p>Even from the perspective of individual countries, it also shows a state of development.</p>
<p>Industrial Production Index of Major Countries (According to the League of Nations Monthly Bulletin)</p>
<p>1928 = 100 United States United Kingdom Germany France Japan</p>
<p>Average in 1932 58.6 86.2 60.5 77.5 110.1</p>
<p>Average in 1933 72.1 90.2 69.0 80.3 134.3</p>
<p>January 1934 70.3 103.3 79.1 83.5 142.5</p>
<p>February 73.6 103.3 82.5 82.7 139.1</p>
<p>March 76.6 103.3 84.2 81.8 139.8</p>
<p>April 77.5 104.1 85.7 81.1 141.3</p>
<p>May 77.5 104.1 88.9 79.5 148.1</p>
<p>June 丨丨丨 104.1 88.5 78.0 丨丨丨</p>
<p>The industrial production indices of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany have all exceeded the levels of the previous two years. Especially in Japan, it has surpassed all countries and developed rapidly. Only France has shown signs of decline. This illustrates the difference between being able to adopt an inflationary policy and having to adhere to a deflationary policy. France is known as the world's second largest gold store, and many people rely on interest for their livelihood, so it is not easy to implement an inflationary policy for a while, and the industry has also declined. Therefore, France is now striving to plan the organization of the gold standard group economy, the intention of which is nothing more than to protect the prosperity of its own industry. However, the development of the economies of the UK and the US, which have stopped the gold standard and implemented inflationary policies, is only like this.</p>
<p>UK and US Economic Index</p>
<p>(UK numbers are based on the Economic Magazine survey, 1924 = 100, US numbers are estimated based on the Annali·t survey level) UK US</p>
<p>Average from January to August 1932 95.65 63.8</p>
<p>Same period in 1933 98.49 71.9</p>
<p>Same period in 1934 107.84 76.2</p>
<p>Although the United Kingdom has improved slightly compared to the United States, it is artificial and there is still no amazing development. If the UK and the US are like this, it is even more conceivable what the economic situation in the world is like.</p>
<p>Moreover, the content of the increase in industrial production is mostly the progress of the military industry. Regarding the military industry, because it is the secret of various countries, although there is a lack of accurate statistics, we can prove one aspect of the rapid development of the military industry from the increase in the productivity of the steel industry. The production of world steel has been prosperous since 1933. The increase in the first half of 1934 was even more significant. The steel production of major countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and the Soviet Union is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Country Production Amount First Half of 1933</p>

<p>Inquired About Morocco's Re-imposition of Tea Tax</p>
<p>Counselor Shu Replied That He Fears This Will Not Happen</p>
<p>The Industry Association said that Mr. He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, according to the Yangzhuang Tea Trade Association, France intends to re-impose import taxes on Chinese tea in Morocco and other places, and it is scheduled to be implemented on January 1 this year, which will have a significant impact on the future of China's tea industry. He, together with Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Department, visited Mr. Shu Xin, Commercial Counselor of the French Consulate General on the Bund of this city at about 9:00 am yesterday for informal talks to inquire in detail about the heavy taxation of Chinese Yangzhuang tea in French Morocco and other places. Mr. Shu replied that French Morocco is an international area, and in fact, it is not something that legal persons can freely and actively control. He has not heard of the imposition of tea tax. Moreover, Annam and other places in the entire territory of this country are tea-producing areas, and the tea produced is only black tea, not green tea. In addition, the entire territory of Morocco is inhabited by Muslims who only use green tea and do not use black tea. He does not believe that heavy taxes will be imposed. The only place where tea tax may be imposed is Algiers, but he is not sure whether the area is currently imposing taxes.</p>

<p>The Yunnan Kunming National Goods Exhibition, sponsored by the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, has collected 18 kinds of national goods, including silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, enamel products, women's products, etc., worth 60,000 yuan, totaling 273 pieces. They will be shipped to Yunnan this morning by the Taikoo Shipping's Qiongzhou, which is expected to arrive in Haiphong, Annam, in early next month, and then transported to Kunming by the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Shanghai manufacturers who will participate include two representatives from the China Iron Factory and the Maya Silk Weaving Factory, as well as two representatives from the Production and Sales Association, who plan to leave on the 15th of this month. If they can't make it, they will take a mail ship from Shanghai to Haiphong around the 20th. The venue for the Yunnan National Goods Exhibition has been arranged, and the opening can be held as soon as the goods arrive. Since the September 18th Incident, French goods have flooded the market in Yunnan Province, resulting in huge losses. The holding of this National Goods Exhibition will allow the public to have faith in national goods and will have a great effect on restoring the national goods market and preventing the dumping of foreign goods.</p>

<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that Mr. Chen Wentian, the general manager of the Modern Logical Literary Column Newspaper, an overseas Chinese in Siam, studied abroad. He returned to China two years ago and was greatly impressed by his motherland. After returning to Siam, he made great efforts to promote the progress of domestic machine handicraft industry, which was greatly trusted by the overseas Chinese. In order to resist the use of foreign goods as the first step, Chen specially launched a large-scale national goods exhibition. Yesterday, he specially wrote to Mr. Liu Shimu, director of the China-South Cultural Association in this port, and famous manufacturers in Shanghai, asking them to introduce and solicit samples of goods for shipment to Siam for display. Chen himself also plans to return to China in March to solicit them in person.</p>

<p>The Xinxin News Agency reported that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, entrusted by the Ministry of Finance, purchased 20 million yuan of silver from Hong Kong. This matter has been confirmed by the banking community. The first batch of silver, about 10 million yuan, will be shipped to Shanghai at the end of the week or the beginning of next week. The remaining will be shipped in succession. The Xinxin News Agency reporter inquired about the details from all parties yesterday, and they are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Motivation for Purchasing Silver <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's silver reserves have been affected by U.S. silver purchases and China's foreign trade deficit. Last year, the silver outflowed amounted to as much as 200 million yuan. After the central government increased the silver export tax, the outflow gradually decreased. Recently, as the Lunar New Year is approaching in Shanghai, most of the money houses and shops are settling accounts at this time, and cash is needed at that time. The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were entrusted by the Ministry of Finance to coordinate the Lunar New Year issue. After several discussions among the three banks, it was decided to purchase 20 million yuan of silver from Hong Kong and ship it to Shanghai to cope with it. The Central Bank is responsible for all the formalities to be handled. This is the general situation of the motivation and process of purchasing silver.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Purchasing Methods <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>There have been various rumors about the method of purchasing silver and importing it, and there is no consensus. Some say that part of the 20 million yuan is to retrieve the silver previously deposited abroad, and some say that it is temporarily borrowed from foreign banks with considerable interest. Others say that it is exchanged for gold bars, and it is said that more than 28,800 gold bars have been shipped out in exchange in recent days. The Xinxin News Agency reporter inquired about the details from Xi Demao, a member of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee. Xi declined to express any opinion on this matter, only saying that the purchase of silver was entrusted by the Ministry of Finance and would soon be seen in reality. Therefore, the content of the purchase method is currently unable to be confirmed.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Shipped to Shanghai This Week <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank began handling all the formalities for shipping silver, they have been completely negotiated. As for the method of shipping silver, due to the excessive amount, it was decided to transport it in batches. The first batch of about 10 million yuan will be shipped to Shanghai at the end of this week or the beginning of next week, and the remaining amount will also be shipped to Shanghai in succession. Therefore, the financial market in this city will be more stable as a result.</p>

<p>Planned to Pledge 10 Million Yuan Face Value for 6 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Xu Qingfu is Negotiating with Various Banks</p>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reported that after the Zhejiang Provincial Government issued 20 million yuan of local public bonds in 1934, it had pledged 5 million yuan of face value to the Bank of China and other banks in this city for 3 million yuan. The contract had been signed long ago, and it was originally scheduled to be paid at the end of last year. However, due to the reorganization of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Wang Zhengying, the Director of the Finance Department, resigned and was replaced by Xu Qingfu, who has not yet made the payment. The Xinxin News Agency reporter learned from the banking community that Xu Qingfu, the Director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, needs to carry out various construction projects in Zhejiang Province, such as dredging rivers and building roads, and is currently negotiating with the lending banks to make the payment as soon as possible. At the same time, it is also planned to continue to pledge 10 million yuan of public bond face value to the banking community for 6 million yuan at a 60% discount, which will be entirely used for construction purposes. He has negotiated with various branches such as the Bank of China in Hangzhou several times, and also discussed with Zhang Gongquan, the General Manager of the Bank of China, at Moganshan. Zhang has agreed to negotiate further after returning to Shanghai. It is reported that Zhang is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Hangzhou today. It is not yet known whether Director Xu will come with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Xiufeng, Secretary of the League of Nations, told the Central News Agency reporter who visited him yesterday morning that the League of Nations' technical cooperation with China is still continuing. He has now appointed Haas, the League of Nations' technical cooperation liaison officer to China, to succeed Laciman. Haas has already departed from Geneva and is coming to China via the United States. He is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 29th of this month aboard the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover. After Haas arrives in Shanghai, he will meet with him and accompany him to Beijing to pay respects to the central authorities. Haas's term in China is two months, and his task is to succeed Laciman. As for his return to China, it is purely a vacation. He will take the opportunity to accompany Haas and fulfill his hospitality duties. After meeting with Haas, he plans to return to his hometown in Guangdong for a trip and will return to Geneva in April. Wu believes that regarding the preparations for war in European countries,</p>

<p>At noon yesterday, the various shipping companies in this port received a secret telegram from the Hong Kong Police Department stating that a group of pirates from Dapeng Bay, disguised as passengers, were secretly coming to Shanghai by ship from Shantou and Hong Kong, intending to rob the sea vessels in Shanghai. There were ten pirates in total, and their whereabouts were very secret. The various shipping companies in Shanghai must quickly prepare for emergencies. The various shipping companies, after receiving this warning, immediately issued an emergency alert order to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Maiden Voyage of the Hai Zhen <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's fourth new sea vessel, the Hai Zhen, sailed on its maiden voyage to Shantou and Guangzhou. Yesterday, after loading cargo and passengers, it set sail at 2:30 pm. The Bureau, after receiving the above warning, immediately informed the captain in secret for the safety of the passengers, and notified the maritime police to carry out the inspection before the ship set sail. Therefore, as soon as the passengers boarded the ship at the cabin door, they were first searched by the maritime police. When the ship arrived at Wusong, a second strict search was carried out. All luggage had to be opened, and female passengers were also searched by female inspectors.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Maritime Police Conduct a Major Search <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>This reporter, after hearing the news, went to the Hai Zhen to meet with Chief Mate Chen and inquired about the search process. When the reporter boarded the ship, he was also searched by the ship's escort team. According to Chief Mate Chen, they received a secret telegram from Hong Kong today (i.e., the 9th) stating that pirates might have sneaked onto the ship, so they were inspected. Other sea vessels such as Taikoo and Jardine also implemented strict inspections.</p>
<p>People in the world are over-worrying. Although some European countries are busy preparing for war, after examining the financial resources of various countries, they are still unable to cope with the outbreak of a second world war.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Measures for Anti-Theft on Ships Total Six Items <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Since the New Hai Men Ship was stolen, the Administrative Inspector of the Third Special District of Zhejiang Province and the Shanghai Shipping Association have discussed the implementation of anti-theft measures, and a total of six items have been decided. The first item is that the radio equipment on all sea vessels must be fully installed before March. It was resolved that all vessels should be installed accordingly. The second item is that all sea vessels should be equipped with emergency mechanisms, all of which must be installed before the end of February. The emergency mechanisms are to be managed by the shipowner. The third item is how to organize the inspection station. It was resolved that the local land and naval military police and the Shipping Bureau should jointly form an inspection station. The fourth item is that armed maritime police should be added to each vessel, and weapons should be borrowed from the maritime police. The fifth item is the inspection of the distress signal equipment on each vessel, which is to be inspected by the Shipping Administration Bureau. The sixth item is the cost of improving the equipment, which is intended to be offset by increasing the price of cargo and passenger tickets. The above six anti-theft measures will be implemented on the Wenzhou, Taizhou, Haimen, Shipu, Chuanshan, and other regular ships.</p>

<p>The Finance Bureau of this city previously stated that the amount of land tax owed in various districts over the years was very large, and formulated a clearing plan, which was submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, and the clearing period was from December 16 of last year to the end of the month. It ordered the land tax collection offices to follow the plan and summon the local Bao to clear the old debts on schedule, and then set a date for urging collection. Now that the deadline has passed, in addition to the part that has been cleared, the rest have not been cleared on schedule because there are many Bao in various places who are colluding, and it takes time to sort them out. It is heard that the Finance Bureau has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval to extend the deadline from January 4 of this year, so that it can continue to handle it. During this extension period, the Bao in various places must bring their grain debt tickets and the grain payments received to the land tax collection office under their jurisdiction for accurate verification and accounting. If they fail to report and conceal the facts, they will be detained and investigated.</p>

<p>The rice industry in this city has always stipulated that the commission for merchants selling rice in Shanghai is 20 cents per dan. Previously, the rice industry requested an increase in the commission from 20 cents to 25 cents, and some even advocated increasing it to 30 cents. As a result, the general merchants rose up in opposition. On the 7th of this month, the merchants announced a market shutdown. Later, Jiang Shizhi of the Rice Sales Industry Association and Jiang Zisheng of the Rice Industry Association took the initiative to mediate and persuaded the merchants to resume business first. After both parties agreed on a compromise, it was decided that from the 7th, the commission was set at 25 cents per dan, and Jiang Shizhi and others would pay a security deposit. If there was any sabotage, it would be deducted from the security deposit. Those who discovered and reported secret sabotage would be given a bonus to ensure compliance by both parties. It is learned that the plan has been agreed upon by both parties and will be implemented immediately.</p>

<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that the five exchanges in this city, including the gold industry, held a joint meeting at the office of the Cloth Exchange on Avenue Edward at 4 pm yesterday. The chairmen of the five exchanges, including Xu Bosun of the Gold Industry, Zhang Weiru of Securities, Mu Ouchu of Cloth, Wang Yiting of Flour, and Gu Xinyi of Miscellaneous Grains, attended. Mu Ouchu chaired the meeting, reported the results of previous petitions to Beijing, and then began to discuss: (1) The review meeting of the two economic and financial groups originally scheduled to be convened by the Legislative Yuan has been postponed due to the inauguration of the new fourth committee in Beijing on the 14th of this month. The representatives can postpone their trip to Beijing for the time being. (2) Please telegraph the Legislative Yuan to convene a review meeting as soon as possible so that they can attend. (3) Regarding the request to exempt the exchange tax, after repeated joint petitions, please ask the chairmen of each exchange to supplement their opinions and prepare a summary so that they can make a full statement when attending the review meeting.

<h3 id="e154">Mingxing Ship Changes Date of Sailing to Ningbo, Industry Opposes Strongly, Shipping Administration Bureau Has Been Asked to Handle <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Sanbei Mingxing Ship has now changed its sailing date to the 14th. When it was preparing to open the Shanghai-Ningbo route, the company asked the three companies on the same route, China Merchants, Taikoo, and Ning Shao, to reorganize and cooperate and re-determine the apportionment ratio. Traditionally, the Shanghai-Ningbo route was divided into 42.5 shares, with Sanbei accounting for 10 shares, China Merchants accounting for 10.05 shares, and Taikoo and Ning Shao each accounting for 11 shares. This time, Mingxing joined. According to Sanbei's request, the four companies still shared the shares, but Sanbei had two ships, and the total was changed to 46 shares. Taikoo, China Merchants, and Ning Shao each got 10 shares, and Sanbei got 16 shares. At the time, under public discussion, it was believed that Sanbei had been receiving subsidies from the three companies every year. Normally, the Ningxing ship could not match the business of any of the other three ships. Now, if it wanted to add another ship and get more shares, the losses of each company would be even greater, so they unanimously opposed it. At that time, the Shipping Administration Bureau intervened to mediate, but to no avail.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Ship Runs Between Shanghai and Ningbo Should Be Reduced <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>According to various companies, business on the Shanghai-Ningbo route last year was not good. With the cooperation of four ships, they could barely cover expenses. When the Dah Sing's Hong Sing Wheel added to the route, the four companies simultaneously stated that it was actually difficult to add more ships to the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Now, with five ships sailing, according to the statistics of each company, each of the five ships travels back and forth 155 times annually, with some traveling 153 times. The total annual round trip capacity of the five ships is 8.8 million tons. However, the total cargo loaded last year was only 143,872 tons. On average, less than two tons of cargo is loaded per hundred tons of capacity. From the perspective of the main business of transportation, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has a large amount of unused tonnage, which is not in line with the principles of production. The most powerful proof that there is only a need to reduce ships and no need to add routes is that.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Submission to the Navigation Bureau for Handling <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ning Shao Company, etc., yesterday, based on the above statistics, stated that the shipping industry is sluggish, and there is no need to add ships to the Shanghai-Ningbo route in reality. With the current five ships, there is still a sense that there are too many ships and too little cargo, resulting in excessive tonnage. Once Ming Xing joins this line again, it will add another 155 trips per year, with each trip estimated at 5,000 tons, requiring an additional 700,000 tons of capacity. However, the volume of cargo going back and forth is decreasing rather than increasing, which will inevitably lead to a wave of competition. Therefore, they have jointly submitted a request to the Maritime Administration Bureau, requesting a fair and equitable handling of the issue of adding routes to the Shanghai-Ningbo line.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Covenant is About to Fall Apart <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>According to people from various shipping companies on the same route, if the Sanbei Ming Xing Wheel does not operate on the Ningbo route, the covenant of the four companies can still be continued by finding a way. Now, the Ming Xing Wheel seems to have been scheduled to sail to Ningbo on the 14th. If this wheel operates on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the cooperation and unity covenant of the four companies will be torn to shreds, and the future of business is not optimistic.</p>

<p>The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and its manager, Mr. Jian Yujie, have both received donation registers from the Joint Relief Committee for Drought Disasters in Various Provinces, requesting them to do their best to solicit donations to help the disaster victims. After receiving them, the company and Manager Jian believed that the drought disasters in various places this year were indeed unprecedented catastrophes. As the severe winter season has arrived, the disaster victims are crying from hunger and suffering from the cold, which is very pitiful. Therefore, the company specially donated 1,000 yuan, and Mr. Jian personally donated 200 yuan, which were sent to the Shanghai Bank for collection a few days ago. At the same time, a letter was sent to notify the Joint Relief Committee to return the donation register.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sickert, a German resident in Beijing, paid attention to the drought disaster in our country and donated 300 yuan, which was handed over to Minister Kong to be transferred to the Joint Relief Committee to relieve the disaster victims. The letter from Minister Kong to the association is now recorded as follows: "Dear Sir, I am sending 300 yuan in national currency donated by Mrs. Sickert of Germany in Nanjing to help your association. Please check and receive it, and send the receipt to Mrs. Sickert, No. 9 Sajiawan, Nanjing, for transfer. Sincerely, National Drought Relief Association."</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan, the silver furnace industry and the public appraisal bureau have been ordered to suspend operations. The Shanghai Silver Industry Association, in view of the problem of exchanging miscellaneous silver in the interior, submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The Ministry approved the import and at the same time ordered the Central Bank to establish a miscellaneous silver material collection and exchange office. If merchants hold this miscellaneous silver, they can request the Central Bank to collect and exchange it in accordance with Article 11 of the Silver Standard Coinage Regulations.</p>

<p>After receiving the order, the Central Bank immediately handed it over to Xi Demao, the manager of the Business Bureau, for preparing the establishment. Now the preparations have been completed, and it is decided to establish it before the end of this month. The bank has submitted a reply to the Ministry of Finance, which will be ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Industry Association to comply with. The address of the collection and exchange office is attached to the Central Bank, and the exchange rules have been announced.</p>

<p>The Joint Relief Association for Drought Disasters in Various Provinces recently received a report from Fang Jun Songru, the Director-General of Urgent Relief Inspection in Lujiang County, stating that Lujiang suffered a major drought this year. The county has few dikes and many mountains, and the people are poor and the land is barren. After the previous flood, the vitality has not recovered. In addition, the price of grain is low, hurting farmers, and the banditry is constantly disturbing the bankruptcy and borrowing. Those who lend are unable to take care of themselves. Hunger is waiting for death, and moaning is unbearable. There is no rain in summer and autumn, and there are many refugees in winter. There are many dead on the road in spring. It is even worse than the disaster in the sixth year of Xianfeng. The south area of Mian Township totals 318 forts. At this time, the inspection has passed halfway. The disaster is heavy, and the tickets are few. It is really less than one in a hundred living. The winter relief is very difficult, and the crowd of those who have not received relief are stretching their necks and enduring hunger. Those who are shivering from the cold are everywhere. Saving one more life is better than building a seven-level pagoda. Please allocate funds for distribution. The association has checked the severity of the drought in Anhui Province, which is more than ordinary. The disaster situation in Lujiang County is like this, and other places can be known. The public officials and elders of the homeland in Anhui, in the heart of compassion, send out the thoughts of compassion, push food to release clothes, and there are many people. It is hoped that people will be brought back to life, and bones will be made white. Even in the midst of severe winter hunger, seeing righteousness and acting bravely will bring immeasurable blessings. This is what is hoped from the great philanthropists who save their hometown and neighbors.</p>

The murderers could not be tracked down. It was not until 10:00 a.m. on the 25th that detectives Su Yinggen and Hua Shouqi arrested two suspects, Zhou Hongtian and Wang Jinsheng, from Taizhou, at 267 Xizang Road and Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. They were sent to the First Special District Court, where they blamed each other. They were ordered to be detained for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide presided over the continued trial. Mr. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated that the circumstances of the case were complex and requested that the hearing be postponed to a special session. The court ordered that the hearing be postponed to the afternoon of the 18th. The two defendants, Zhou and Wang, were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Detectives Hang Bingquan, Bao He Zongyu, Cai Zongyi, Song Kebang, Zhu Junpei, Wang Wenwei, etc., of the French Concession Police Gambling Squad, learned on the evening of the 7th of this month that Shao Youfeng was using the name of birthday celebrations to gather crowds inside the Southeast Hongyun Restaurant at 69 Caishi Road, Taiping Bridge, to open a gambling den and skim profits, which violated the ban. They rushed there at 11:00 p.m. that night and arrested the boss, Shao Youfeng, the waiter, Zhou Jinsheng, and 88 gamblers, Zhou Guangyuan, Hu Sipeng, Gao Guanghou, Cheng Yifei, Shao Asi, Hu Guisong, Tian Afu, Hu Meisheng, Shao Zengliang, Cheng Jiashan, Xu Yuansi, Huang Yukai, Cheng Konghua, Mu Jiayi, Ding Shichun, Cheng Jintao, etc., on the spot.

They also arrested Zhou Yanzhe (from Huizhou), the manager of the restaurant, for providing a gambling venue, which violated the regulations. After being taken to the police station for investigation, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court the next day. Judge Sun Pengxian interrogated them. Lawyer Fei Xizhen from the police station explained the case and prosecuted them for the crime of gambling and gambling property. Then Bao Detective reported the process of solving the case and presented the evidence, gambling tools, and gambling money. The defendants admitted to gambling, skimming profits, and gambling property. The court verified the confessions, announced the end of the trial, and scheduled the verdict for the 15th. The defendants Zhou Yanzhe and Shao Youfeng were taken into custody, and the other defendants were ordered to be released on bail with a guarantor who could be summoned at any time. Those without a guarantor were taken into custody.</p>

<p>Denounced for Violating National Laws and Greatly Opposing Humanitarianism</p>
<p>Reckless Abuse of the Favorable Treatment of Foreigners in China and Insulting the Reputation of the British Emperor</p>
<p>—Due to the Seriousness of the Case, Continued Bail is Not Allowed—</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Evening News reports that on January 2nd, a fire broke out accidentally in the servants' room of a foreign house at 361 Anhe Temple Road, and morphine manufacturing equipment and a large number of raw materials were found in the main house. The owner of the house, an Englishman named Xiang Sheng, has recently returned to his country. His wife was arrested two days later and released on bail of 2,000 yuan. Today (the 9th), she was brought to trial by the British Consular Court. The defendant hired a lawyer, Bai Lang, to defend her. The court presented a large number of exhibits, including porcelain containers filled with heroin, opium, and other materials for manufacturing morphine.</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Large Number of Raw Materials <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>In addition, there were countless porcelain funnels of various sizes, a huge furnace, and various packages and chemical bottles. The defendant was charged with violating the British government's 1924 ban on narcotics in China by manufacturing narcotics. This morning, she sat silently behind her lawyer with a sullen face. First, the prosecutor, Li Kesi, stated that the defendant not only violated national laws but also greatly opposed humanitarianism. The British government had recently assisted the Chinese government in Geneva in eliminating the huge harm of the narcotics trade, and the Chinese government had issued a clear order that anyone who trafficked drugs would be sentenced to death, and even those who smoked drugs would also be subject to this severe penalty. Last year, in this area, there were</p>

<p>There were as many as 114 people who violated narcotics laws. There is credible evidence that the defendant was engaged in the narcotics trade. This behavior of the defendant is a reckless abuse of the favorable treatment enjoyed by foreigners in China and insults the reputation of the British Emperor. Li Kesi then described in detail the circumstances of the case and said that the defendant had refused to open the door that day to allow the detectives to inspect, claiming that she had no keys. Later, a locksmith was called to open the door, and the morphine manufacturing equipment was discovered. The defendant then fainted and fell to the ground. The defendant's husband went to Europe in December of last year. After the incident, the defendant sent a telegram to her husband using the Pentley code, but there were three words in it that were coded. This</p>
<h3 id="e191">Is of Particular Importance <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>When asked what the three words meant, she replied that she was telling her husband that she and the baby were safe. Li Kesi concluded by saying that there was one more point that was also worth noting. Before moving to Anhe Temple Road in early December 1934, the defendant was in dire straits, lacking food and clothing, and relying entirely on charitable organizations for assistance. Now she lives in a house with a monthly rent of 390 yuan, which she pays on time, and has also purchased a new car. After Mr. Li finished his speech, detectives Moore, Meissen, and Dunn of the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station successively described the process of solving the case and</p>

<p>After they finished, the interrogator, Morris, questioned the defendant. The defendant repeatedly claimed that she was innocent. Then the interrogator announced the adjournment and, due to the seriousness of the case, did not allow continued bail. He ordered the defendant to be temporarily detained in the Xiamen Road West Prison and scheduled the hearing to resume next Wednesday. The defendant's lawyer, Bai Lang, asked what would happen to the defendant's child. The interrogator replied, "I'm sorry, I can't do anything." After speaking, he hurriedly left the court, and the defendant wept incessantly.</p>

<p>Registration began on the 7th</p>
<p>Physical examinations start today</p>
<p>The First Labor Nursery, sponsored by the Municipal Children's Welfare Committee, has been preparing since last year. The internal organization and funding have been planned and arranged properly, and houses No. 1 to 5 near Panfang on Penglai Road have been rented as the location. The original plan was to open on the 4th of this month, but the opening was postponed to today (the 10th) due to the incomplete renovation of the interior. The public is welcome to visit. It is also learned that the nursery began registration on the 7th and today (the 10th and 11th), Nurse Zhu Jicang, the director, will begin physical examinations for the children to be entrusted. The initial intake is limited to 30 children. The entrustment method is that the nursery will issue an entrustment certificate for each child. Each evening, the parents will bring the certificate to pick up their child and take them home. The next morning, before 7:00 a.m., they will send them back to the nursery for entrustment. In the future, the quota will still need to be expanded. As for the preparation of the Second and Third Labor Nurseries, the Children's Welfare Association will consider the results of the opening of the first nursery before planning the funding and continuing to run them separately.</p>

<p>Kinnas Lyon, a Western police chief at the Jing'an Temple Police Station in the Public Concession, is a British national, 32 years old, and is amiable and approachable. He has never spoken harshly or sternly, so all Chinese and Western police officers in the police station are happy to befriend him. Lyon has not yet married, but it is said that he had a love affair with a Chinese woman, but soon Lyon cohabited with a Russian girl, and the Russian girl is already pregnant and about to give birth. Unexpectedly, the affair was discovered by the Chinese woman, who was burning with jealousy and immediately launched a major interrogation. In this situation, Lyon felt embarrassed and looked troubled. He was a completely different person from before. On the morning of the 7th, Lyon suddenly claimed to be ill and asked the police station for leave. At that time, the matter was considered normal, so no one suspected anything else. However, at about 1:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 8th), Lyon suddenly shot himself in the head with a double-barreled shotgun in the police station dormitory. By the time the police station staff arrived after hearing the sound, Lyon was already lying stiff in a pool of blood, dead. The police chief immediately reported to the Western District chief, who transferred the body to the coroner's office and reported to the British Consulate for someone to examine it. It is still difficult to confirm the truth. However, according to speculation by others, it may have been caused by a love triangle. The police station is still investigating the matter.</p>

<p>At about 4:00 p.m. yesterday, at No. 3 Shanzhong Road, French Concession, a Chinese coal ball distribution point, two robbers suddenly came, one wearing a blue-gray cotton robe, a peaked cap, and a yellow short coat, and the other bald. Both were about 20 years old and spoke with a local accent. After entering the store, the bald robber took out a pistol and robbed 12 yuan from the counter before fleeing in a hurry. At that time, an employee of the store immediately chased after them and called for the police. A Vietnamese constable, No. 192 of the French Concession Police, happened to be patrolling and immediately joined the chase and fired shots. In a fit of desperation, one of the robbers turned around and fired several shots at the constable, one of which hit the constable in the head, killing him instantly. At the same time, nearby detectives rushed to the scene after hearing the gunshots and tried to encircle and arrest them. As a result, only one suspect was intercepted, identified as Li Heshang, 24 years old, from Pudong. The suspect was hit by a bullet in the thigh, but the two robbers who committed the robbery at the scene escaped. The police station is now conducting a thorough investigation. As for the body of the Vietnamese constable, it will be examined and then a decision will be made.</p>

<p>Zhou Heshang, a 32-year-old fisherman from Haining, who used to live at No. 103 Huanghe Road in the French Concession, made a living by selling fish. On September 18th of last year, at 6:00 a.m., he went to Yongtai Fish Store at No. 6 Daxiaodongmenwai Avenue to purchase crabs from Yu Guilin, a silkworm dealer from Minhang. They argued over the replacement of dead crabs, and Yu punched Zhou in a vital spot. Zhou immediately squatted down and died. The police station arrested the murderer, Yu Guilin, and sent him to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution for the crime of intentional injury causing death. The deceased's wife, Zhou Wangshi (29 years old, from Haining), was introduced by a friend, Shi Ahong, and hired lawyer Zhou Yongding to handle the case, with an attached private prosecution seeking damages. At that time, an engagement contract was signed, agreeing on a legal fee of 200 taels of silver. After signing the contract, lawyer Zhou immediately acted as an agent to appear in court to continue the attached civil suit and request. Subsequently, the prosecution department</p>

<p>Yesterday, he invited Xu Peihuang and others to try it out and they were satisfied</p>
<p>Mass production will be started to meet the needs of various provinces such as Henan</p>
<p>Tang Zhongming, the inventor of charcoal cars, after obtaining a five-year patent from the Ministry of Industry, came to Shanghai from Beijing in the early winter of last year and established the Zhongming Factory at No. 270 Qiqihar Road, Yangshupu, to manufacture charcoal cars, which have been completely successful. At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, Mr. Tang, accompanied by a driver, drove a self-made charcoal car to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities on Fenglin Bridge and invited Director Xu Peihuang to try it out. Those who accompanied him on the test ride included Bureau Chief Zhang, Fan Zhengbo, Secretary of the Nanchang Pacification Headquarters, Tang Ying of Tongji University, Zhu Yingpeng, Secretary-General of China Public School, and Jiang Yingchu, Zhang Jiping, and others, the president of the Jinghu Datong Society. They traveled around Shanghai for a week, and Director Xu and others were very satisfied. The car ran exactly the same as an ordinary car, but the economy was five or six times better than an ordinary car. It is also learned that the factory is now greatly expanding production to meet the needs of provinces such as Henan and Sichuan, and is being reorganized into a company, with Huang Jinrong as chairman and Fan Zhengbo as general manager. Today, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, and others will be invited to try it out to prove the success of domestically produced cars. It will also invite the press soon to promote it.</p>
<p>Sentenced Yu Guilin to four years and eight months in prison for various circumstances, as reported in previous newspapers. As for the private prosecution part, the family of the defendant Yu Guilin hired someone to directly settle with the deceased's wife, Zhou Wangshi, and paid 700 yuan. After Zhou Wangshi settled the private prosecution, she sent lawyer Zhou 20 yuan for travel expenses. Lawyer Zhou refused to accept the travel expenses because there was a contract and she could not go back on her word. He charged 200 taels for legal fees according to the contract. Zhou Wangshi then accused lawyer Zhou of bullying and extortion and refused to pay the legal fees. Lawyer Zhou then filed a private prosecution against Zhou Wangshi in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for the crime of defamation. After the trial, Zhou Wangshi was sentenced to a fine of 60 yuan and two years of probation. Subsequently, lawyer Zhou Yongding filed a petition with the Second Special District Court for conciliation regarding Zhou Wangshi's unpaid legal fees, but it was invalid. He then formally filed a civil lawsuit against Zhou Wangshi and Shi Ahong, requesting that they be summoned and pursued. The court, according to the petition, summoned the two defendants to the Sixth Court presided over by Judge Wu Xiaoke yesterday, but neither of the defendants appeared in court. Only the plaintiff appeared in court and stated the facts of the case. The court ordered that the defendants be summoned again on the 16th for interrogation.</p>

<p>Cui Ziguang, a 25-year-old man from Suzhou, lives in the pavilion room on the upper floor of the Jingmei Cake Shop (owned by 47-year-old Ningbo native Wu Xingkang) at No. 141 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. He used to be in the bread business, but has recently been unemployed and idle. He is struggling financially and lives with his elderly mother, wife, and children. He saw that the second landlord, Wu Xingkang, the owner of the cake shop, was making a profit from his business and had a small amount of savings, so he had bad intentions. On November 27, November 29, December 7, December 19, and December 20 of last year, Cui, under the name of Zheng Jinbiao, wrote five threatening letters in a row and sent them to Wu Xingkang through the post office, demanding 5,000 yuan. The first four letters asked to contact him at the Mass Education Cooperative in Wenmiao Park. The fifth letter changed the location to the Deyitea House in Yuyuan Garden in Yemiao. On the one hand, he volunteered to Wu and was willing to be a representative to contact the bandits. On December 20, Cui replied to Wu that the bandits had agreed to reduce the amount, but needed 500 yuan. Wu, unable to pay, asked Cui to discuss reducing the amount of money again. The next day, Cui falsely told Wu that after exhausting all discussions, at least 150 yuan was needed, otherwise it would not be possible to settle the matter. Wu, in order to settle the matter, gave Cui 70 yuan on the evening of the 21st and asked him to pay it first, and the remaining 80 yuan would be paid when he had raised the money. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by Inspector Jin Jiulin of the French Concession Police, who sent detectives Zhou Buguang and Cai Jinzhang and patrolman Zhu Jutong to wait in ambush at the Jingmei Cake Shop on the 22nd. Before long, they saw Cui go out and followed him, intending to secretly arrest the extortionist bandits. Who knew that Cui was carrying the 70 yuan given by Wu Xingkang and went out to buy a wallet at a department store first, and then set off for the Chinese community. The detectives followed behind and saw that Cui did not take the Yemiao route, but walked towards Tongqing Street. The detectives followed him to the end of Tongqing Street and, thinking that Cui was suspicious, they rushed up to stop and question him. Cui confessed that he had written threatening letters in order to defraud money for his own use. The detectives then arrested Cui, took him to the Public Security Bureau for filing, and then took him back to the French Concession Police Station to obtain the five threatening letters from Wu Xingkang and sent him to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution against Cui for the crimes of extortion and fraud. The details of the interrogation have been recorded in previous newspapers. The case has been investigated by Judge Zhang Chaozuo, who yesterday opened the court and briefly interrogated Cui and sentenced Cui Ziguang to one year and six months of imprisonment for fraud. The number of days detained before the judgment was determined to be two days for one day of imprisonment. The five letters were confiscated and the stolen money was returned to the victim. After the sentence, the defendant was taken into custody at the detention center, awaiting the expiration of the appeal period before being sent to prison for execution.</p>

<p>Wu Zhigang (i.e., Shuchun), a deceased local man who lived at No. 2 Wu Family Residence, South End, Longhua Town, used to sell drugs and made a lot of profit, so his family had a lot of savings. His wife, Cai, gave birth to four sons and two daughters. The second son, Jiagen, is now 22 years old and works as a teacher in a private school. Two years ago, he married Lu Linyun, a 21-year-old local woman from Xinqiaotou who works as a cook, through a matchmaker. After entering the house, they were initially harmonious, but recently they have often quarreled, and Jiagen has a very fierce temper and often beats her severely. On October 18th of last year, Lu was injured by being beaten and filed a complaint with the police station, but it was later withdrawn after persuasion from relatives. Unexpectedly, the night before last, Jiagen beat and kicked Lu again for the second time, causing her to be bruised all over and her body to be covered in injuries. This triggered a miscarriage (Lu was six months pregnant), and she died the next morning. When Lu's parents and relatives found out about this, they rushed to see her and saw the deceased lying on a board, her whole body purple and her blood stained all over the place. Wu's entire family, men and women, had already fled, leaving only Wang Xiaoshanzi, a Yancheng native hired temporarily, to watch over the body. They took Wang Xiaoshanzi to the Longhua Security Group and temporarily detained him, and burned all of Lu's dowry. Later, Cai Rongxiang, the head of the district, came out to mediate and agreed to handle the funeral generously. However, it is still being persuaded whether the Lu family will comply.</p>

<p>Prosecuted for Murder After a Clear Investigation by the Prosecutor</p>
<p>The Details of the Case were Clarified Yesterday and the Sentence is Scheduled for the 14th</p>
<p>Hong Weiqing, a Haimen native, accused Miao Fengxiang, the patrolman of the Second Sub-Bureau of the Haimen Changle Town Public Security Bureau, and Jing, the chief of the Seventh Sub-Bureau of the Haimen Public Security Bureau, of premeditated murder in the Shanghai Local Court. His statement roughly stated that his younger brother, Hong Weixin, was tragically killed by the defendants on December 24th, 1919, after being framed. He appealed according to the law, requesting redress. However, the defendants colluded with new and old local bullies and added evil forces day by day, threatening and intimidating him, making it difficult to fulfill his wish. Fortunately, the fellow villagers in Shanghai deeply knew of Weixin's grievance, so they organized a support association. It has been more than three years since it was sent to your court for investigation. The defendants rely on having a lot of money,</p>

<p>Not only did he evade appearing in court, but he also openly declared that a certain matter had been arranged, and a certain issue was no longer a problem, saying that if the accuser appeared in court, he would be dealt with in the same manner as the deceased. As a result, the accuser had no way to redress the injustice. Subsequently, after the Shanghai-Qidong Victims' Support Association sent personnel to inquire about the reasons why the accusers did not appear in court, it was learned that they had received a summons from your esteemed court. The first defendant, Miao Fengxiang, had been taken into custody and requested to be brought to justice. The presiding judge in this case, Prosecutor Yang An, repeatedly held court hearings, conducted thorough interrogations, and prosecuted the case in accordance with the law, charging the accused with murder and requesting a public trial for Jing Bi, Miao Fengxiang, and others.</p>

<p>Jing Bi, as the Director of the 7th Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Haimen County, was by nature rude and brutal, and extremely fond of killing. On November 4th of the 19th year of the Republic, taking advantage of the rampant communist bandits in Haimen County, he used the pretext of suppressing bandits and shot and killed a teahouse customer named Yang Zhaoti in the Shiyun Road teahouse in Dacheng Town. Afterwards, he falsely reported that Yang Zhaoti was a bandit who opened fire to resist arrest and was killed on the spot. On December 24th of the same year, in front of the Shi family residence about three li south of Sanxing Town, he ordered Patrol Officer Miao Fengxiang to shoot and kill a suspected bandit named Hong Weixin, also falsely reporting that Hong Weixin had seized a gun to resist arrest and was killed on the spot. The Shanghai-Qidong Victims' Support Association filed a complaint with the Control Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Transfer for Disciplinary Action <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The Central Public Servants Disciplinary Committee sent a letter to the Jiangsu Higher Court, transferring the case for investigation. (Reasons for prosecution and legal provisions violated) In this case, Jing Bi, Miao Fengxiang, and others, using the pretext that Yang Zhaoti and Hong Weixin were bandits, arbitrarily and indiscriminately killed them on the grounds of opening fire to resist arrest. The family members of the victims, Huang Dingyi, Hong Liu Shi, Hong Weiqing, and others, appeared in court to provide detailed accounts. Furthermore, Mao Xian, an investigator from the Control Yuan, went to the scene of the crime to investigate and confirmed the facts. Upon reviewing the original county files, it was found that Jing Bi's report stated that Yang Zhaoti and several accomplices were conspiring in the Shiyun Road teahouse. When the officers attempted to arrest them, Yang Zhaoti and one of his accomplices each</p>

<p>And resisted the officers. Seeing that the bandits continued to fire and were extremely fierce, fearing danger, the officers fired back, hitting Yang Zhaoti in the chest, causing him to fall and die immediately. This account does not match the original county coroner's report, which stated that Yang Zhaoti had three bullet wounds in his back, with entry wounds on the spine and exit wounds on the chest. Moreover, according to the teahouse owner Shi Yunlu's testimony in the original county court, "I only heard three gunshots that day. When I went into the room, Yang Zhaoti had already been shot dead." This indicates that Yang Zhaoti did not open fire to resist arrest at the time, making it clear that Jing Bi arbitrarily and indiscriminately killed him without a doubt. As for Hong Weixin,</p>

<p>Although Miao Fengxiang argued, "After Director Jing and I apprehended Hong Weixin, while passing about three li south of Sanxing Town, Hong Weixin seized the gun of police officer Lu Shunkang and attempted to escape, and opened fire to resist arrest. Director Jing then ordered us to fire back, and the bullets entered from the back," this account does not match the original county coroner's report, which stated that Hong Weixin had one bullet wound on his right forehead, with the bullet exiting from the back of his head, and one bullet wound in his chest, with the bullet exiting from his spine. Moreover, it was testified, "There were five or six police officers with us at the time, and each of us carried firearms. If Hong Weixin had indeed</p>

<p>Why were none of Jing Bi and the other five or six officers injured? Furthermore, since he had already been arrested, how could he have had the opportunity to seize a firearm, and how would he have dared to use a seized gun to resist five or six firearms? His defense is clearly an attempt to evade responsibility. Considering their actions, Jing Bi committed two offenses under Article 43 of the Criminal Code and Article 282, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Miao Fengxiang committed one offense under Article 282, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Both should be punished in accordance with Article 2 of the Amnesty Law and Article 140 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, they are prosecuted under Article 253 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The case was heard by Judge Guan Liting, but no conclusion was reached. Yesterday morning, Judge Guan specially opened the</p>

<p>For the trial. The accuser hired Lawyer Li Ming to appear in court and requested to pursue a private prosecution, calculating damages for the victim Hong Weixin's life, who was only 24 years old at the time of his death, until the age of 60, for a total of 36 years, at a rate of 100 yuan per month, requesting a total of 43,200 yuan. After the judge took his seat, the first witness, Fan Dekang, testified that he was 56 years old, from Ningbo, and had been engaged in the tea business in Haimen. About three or four years ago, I went to visit my sick nephew and saw five or six policemen escorting Hong Weixin eastward. I was walking westward. Because I was afraid, I walked along the riverbank. I looked back and saw two policemen</p>

<p>And shooting him to death. The judge asked, "Do you recognize Miao Fengxiang?" He replied, "I do." The judge ordered Miao Fengxiang, who was in custody, to be brought to the stand. Fan Dekang identified him without error. Miao Fengxiang testified that Hong Weixin was indeed a robber. The judge said, "It is true that you shot him to death." Miao replied, "Because he seized our firearms, and the director ordered it, so he was shot to death by my brothers." Hong Weiqing testified, "My brother Weixin suffered a wrongful and tragic death. I request justice." Finally, Yu Jingshou, the representative of the Shanghai-Qidong Victims' Support Association, recounted the events. At this point, Prosecutor Yang An rose to present the prosecution's case. The judge, considering the case to be clear, declared the hearing concluded and scheduled the verdict for 10:00 AM on the 14th of this month. Miao Fengxiang was returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>

<p>Two Shelters Have Reached Over Two Thousand People</p>
<p>Women, Children, and the Poor are Temporarily Not Being Accepted</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Shelter for the Poor has been receiving a large number of poor people recently. The shelter submitted a document to the United Charities Association yesterday, stating, "Respectfully submitting this report, as of the 5th of this month, excluding those sent to drug rehabilitation centers and hospitals for treatment, both shelters house a total of 1,940 poor people. The second shelter, located in the Chao Hui Villa, opened on the 1st of this month. The number of poor people seeking shelter has been increasing continuously. The total number of new and old cotton clothes and pants is less than 1,000 sets, which is not enough to distribute completely to the poor people. We are deeply concerned about this insufficiency. The daily requirement for rice is currently over 15 shi. It is estimated that the number of people seeking shelter this year will be even greater than in previous years. We hereby respectfully request your esteemed association to expand fundraising, especially for cotton clothes and pants, to avoid difficulties in providing for the needs of the shelter. We are submitting a report on the income and expenses of the shelter from December 1st to December 31st of last year for your review. This is for your convenience." At the same time, the shelter sent a document to the Public Security Bureau, stating, "Respectfully replying to your letter regarding the establishment of a second shelter and requesting that stray poor people be sent for shelter. We have instructed our subordinates to comply. After investigating, the total number of poor people sheltered in both shelters has reached over 2,000. Although the weather is not yet very cold, the number of people seeking shelter has been increasing continuously. However, due to the difficulties in managing and providing for women and children, we do not yet have facilities for women, making it difficult to accommodate them. We are hereby respectfully requesting that you take this into consideration and instruct your subordinate branches and teams to send only male stray poor people to our shelter. Please make other arrangements for female and child stray poor people to avoid causing inconvenience. We are grateful for your consideration."</p>

<p>The Two Railways Administration issued an order to all departments, stating, "Upon investigation, Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for Employees and Their Families to Use Official Business Ride Passes or Free Ride Passes, promulgated by this administration, stipulates that a Family Ride Pass Form should be attached when issuing Free Ride Passes to employees' families. The original intention of this law was to facilitate ticket inspectors to check whether the age of the user matches the information recorded on the pass, thereby preventing abuses. When employees themselves use the pass, their badge and service certificate can be checked, making it unnecessary to attach a pass form. However, some departments have also attached this pass form when issuing Free Ride Passes to employees themselves, which is unnecessarily repetitive and cumbersome. It is hereby stipulated that from January 1, 1935, Family Ride Pass Forms will no longer be attached when employees themselves apply for Free Ride Passes. A stamp stating 'Badge and Service Certificate Required for Ticket Inspection on the Train' will be added to the pass. The procedures for employees' families to apply for Free Ride Passes will remain the same. To simplify the procedures, receipts for employees and their families applying for Free Ride Passes will be cancelled from January 1st of this year. This order is hereby issued for compliance."</p>

<p>Yin Zhuqing Severely Stabs His Mistress</p>
<p>Escapes and Dies by Poisoning in a Hotel</p>
<p>Yin Zhuqing, a 56-year-old man from Taixing, lived at No. 6, Huiyuan Lane, Huade Road. He was previously a driver at the tram company and is now unemployed. A year ago, he became acquainted with Zhang Yumei, a 30-year-old woman from Liyang, and rented a room on the front floor of No. 14, Songjia Lane, Beijing Road, as a place for their rendezvous. Initially, the two were quite loving, but in the past month, the woman, seeing that Yin's money was running out and that he was old, became romantically involved with a man surnamed Tan. This was suddenly discovered, so on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at about 5:00 PM, he secretly hid a razor and went to Zhang's place, falsely claiming that someone from his hometown had come to Shanghai and invited Zhang and her niece, Song Shupan (age 13), to visit together. They took the No. 7 tram to Tilanqiao, then walked to a remote area on Beiqiwupu Road, Pei Kai'er Road. Yin suddenly grabbed Zhang Yumei by the hair and strangled her neck. (At this time, the girl Song was frightened and ran home.) He then stabbed Zhang six times in the face and other areas with the razor. Zhang cried out for help, and they dispersed. Yin, fearing punishment, went to Room 34 of the Continental Hotel, No. 640, Lane 6, Huade Road, and committed suicide by poisoning himself. Zhang went to the Yulin Road Police Station to report what happened. The police station ordered Deputy Inspector Yang Peisheng and detectives Pan Yunlong to investigate. A razor with bloodstains, a wooden comb, and some hair were found at the scene. They went to Yin's house, but he was not there. They went to nearby hotels to investigate. At about 5:00 AM the next morning, they found Yin in the Continental Hotel, but he was groaning in bed from poisoning. They took him to the Sacred Heart Hospital, but he died despite treatment. The body was taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Zhang is also being treated in the hospital, and her injuries are quite serious. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District District Court, accompanied by forensic doctors Wei and Zhang and clerk Wang Zuyi, went to the office to examine the body. First, the detectives reported the results of their investigation. Then, Song Shuji, a 13-year-old girl, testified, "Zhang Yumei is my aunt. We live together at No. 14, Songjia Lane, Beijing Road. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at about 5:00 PM, Yin suddenly came and invited Zhang and me to visit relatives in Tilanqiao. Later, at Qiwupu Road, Yin suddenly grabbed my aunt's hair and strangled her neck. I was terrified and ran home." Yin Genfu testified, "I am a coppersmith at the tram company. The deceased is my father. I don't know how he died. He has spent two or three thousand yuan on Zhang. I request justice." After Guo Jun obtained the testimony, he ordered that the deceased Yin Zhuqing, a male, had indeed died by poisoning himself before his death. The body was handed over to his son Yin Genfu for burial. It was also learned that Zhang Yumei was a prostitute.</p>

Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the police station stated that Xu Xiaxian had not committed any crime and requested that she be released first. However, Zheng Xingwu had committed other crimes, such as kidnapping for ransom, in Shaoxing and Sheng County. The Hangzhou Security Bureau had brought informant Yu Changrong to the police station to identify Zheng, confirming that he was at the scene at the time. Therefore, today, the Zhejiang Security Bureau sent personnel to the court to request his transfer. Our lawyer has no objection. Li Guoxin, a staff member of the Zhejiang Security Bureau, submitted an official document stating that Zheng Xingwu was involved in the kidnapping of Ma Dawo, the grandson of Ma Yuesong, a resident of Sheng County, and that the accomplices in the case, Ma Wuquan and Chen Bingquan, had been arrested and confessed that Zheng was an accomplice.

<p>Most Going to Japan, Followed by England, Germany and Italy, Fewest to France and America</p>

Japan is the most popular destination, due to the low value of the yen and the simplicity of the procedures. England and Germany are second. Studying in America and France, which used to account for the majority in the past few years, has become very rare recently. Furthermore, those studying in Italy, who previously constituted a very small number, are now quite numerous, as the Italian government is currently welcoming students from our country to study there. As for the subjects studied by these students, engineering and technology are more popular than social sciences, which is also a positive phenomenon.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Wang Xinmin, He Bingsong, and Others Publish a Declaration on Culture Construction Rooted in China (Part 1) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xinming, He Bingsong, Wu Yugan, Sun Hanbing, Huang Wenshan, Tao Xisheng, Zhang Yi, Chen Gaoyong, Fan Zhongyun, Sa Mengwu, and others have issued a declaration on culture construction rooted in China, stating:</p>
<p>1. China is Gone: In the realm of culture, we cannot see present-day China. China is in a dense fog, its form indistinct, in a severe cold where all things are curled up, with no light and no heat. In order to seek light and heat, Chinese people are suffering, groping, and struggling. Some are desperately burrowing into the tombs of the ancients, hoping to beg a little light and heat from the skeletons; others are clinging to the feet of European and American missionaries, hoping that the missionaries will lower a rope to save all living beings and hoist them up to the bright and warm heaven. But the skeletons are leading them from the edge of darkness to the depths of darkness, from the bleak late autumn into the frigid winter. The missionaries are suspending them in mid-air, causing them to drift, wander, yearn, and grope in a realm of emptiness where they cannot touch the sky above or the earth below. The result is the same disappointment. China has disappeared in the realm of culture. The form of Chinese politics, the organization of society, and the content and form of thought have lost their characteristics. The people nurtured by this uncharacteristic politics, society, and thought can no longer be considered Chinese. Therefore, we can confidently say that from the perspective of culture, China no longer exists in the modern world, and even within China's territory, there are almost no Chinese people left. To enable China to raise its head again in the realm of culture, and to ensure that Chinese politics, society, and thought all possess Chinese characteristics, we must engage in cultural construction rooted in China. Japanese painters often say, "Although Westerners dislike the excessively strong colors of Japanese paintings, if Japanese paintings did not have that glaringly strong color, how could they be Japanese paintings?" We also need to have such an understanding in cultural construction. To engage in cultural construction rooted in China, we must use a critical attitude and scientific methods to examine China's past, grasp China's present, and build China's future. We should make our greatest efforts in these three areas.</p>
<p>2. A Complete Reckoning: China once occupied a very important position in the realm of culture. From ancient times until the Qin and Han dynasties, it was in a process of upward progress. The Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods formed our Greek and Roman era, which was truly a flourishing period of Chinese culture. But after the Han dynasty, Chinese culture stagnated. Although the Song and Ming dynasties saw a new development, integrating indigenous Confucianism and Taoism with foreign Buddhism, it did not exceed the scope of past culture. Ultimately, it was something inherited. It was not until the Opium War that a major qualitative change occurred. Battleships and cannons brought news of Western culture, bringing a warning that threatened to lead China into a new era. Thus, the ancient culture was shaken, and we awakened from our inherited slumber. Accompanying this awakening was the "Westernization Movement" of Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang, the "Reform Movement" of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, and the "Revolutionary Movement" of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Zeng and Li's Westernization Movement only knew the importance of "strong armor and sharp weapons" and "sound, light, chemistry, and electricity," which was entirely an imitation of technology. Kang and Liang's Reform Movement focused on legal reform to strengthen the country, which was merely a political plagiarism. These can all be said to be the view of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical use." Although it had its own historical mission of eliminating the old and establishing the new at the time, it was, after all, a superficial and reformist method that could not satisfy the demands of the time. Thus, there was the Xinhai Revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He took the principle of "saving China's inherent things from the root" and "catching up with what others already have" as a prerequisite, advocating for a thorough reform of China's society, politics, and economy.</p>

<p>Defeats Tongde Medical College 3-0</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rain cleared up, and the water puddles on the ground showed signs of drying. At 2:00 PM, the final of the Independent College Joint Sports Meet soccer championship was held. The participants in the final were Zhongfa Industrial College from Group A and Tongde Medical College from Group B, holding the closing game of the soccer tournament. The two sides clashed at the Jiaotong University soccer field. There were about a thousand cheerleaders and spectators present, which was the most spectacular situation of all the sports competitions. The players, amidst applause, entered the field one after another in high spirits, warming up and testing their foot skills. The referee blew the silver whistle, and the battle began. One was a famous iron army, and the other was a rising star. The drums and flags were evenly matched, and the swords and crossbows were drawn, killing each other. Soon, Zhongfa's right forward passed to the center forward, dribbling the ball forward. The Tongde defender blocked the charge, immediately turned and passed the ball to the center forward, dribbling it a few steps in the crowd, lifting his foot and shooting low, accurately, and quickly towards the left corner. The Tongde goalkeeper tried his best to block the shot, but the ball had already entered the net and could not be saved. After the defeat, Tongde launched a major offensive. The five forwards coordinated well, full of murderous intent, and their momentum was like breaking bamboo. But Zhongfa's front and back defenders were like copper walls and iron walls, densely arranged in a net, with strict defense, which really made it impossible for Tongde's forwards to take advantage of the gap. After a long time of such a melee, neither side gained anything, and the first half ended, with the battle temporarily suspended. Zhongfa won 1-0. After the break, Zhongfa continued to take advantage of the victory, with the right forward receiving the support of the forward and midfielder, protecting his position, and directly attacking the opponent's camp, scoring two more goals. Tongde refused to show weakness and ordered the three armies to kill into Zhongfa's interior. Unexpectedly, Zhongfa's right defender, due to excessive defense, touched the ball with his hand, and a penalty kick was awarded, which was kicked in by the Tongde center forward. A few minutes later, the whistle blew to stop the game. The final result was 3-0, a great victory for Zhongfa. The names and positions of Zhongfa's players are recorded below:</p>
<p>Lai ZhiQiu, Xie Gongliang, Lin Foxian, Cai Fuxiang, Yu Zongzhou, Chen Bingjun, Hu Mingkai, Hua Zurong, Xu Jinhai, He Xiaoyi, Ye Chuanfu.</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Hearing the Words, She Covers Her Tears and Sells Herself, Complaining of Hardship. Carefully Peering at the Invitation, She Earnestly Relies on Them.</p>
<p>Auntie Hu did not speak for a long time, then she replied, "Oh! How can he blame Master Cheng? Every word you say is what we poor people think. Other things are fake, but this is real." As she spoke, she held two silver dollars in her hand, bounced them up and down. Then she smiled and said, "The guests in this Little Western Paradise, there are upper, middle, and lower classes, right? Who would be willing to take out these shiny silver dollars to give to others?" Li Shilian understood completely at this time that it was Cheng Zhiqian who had shown a little kindness and touched the hearts of these two women. So he forced a smile and said, "There are many people who say good things these days, but few who do good deeds. Who wouldn't say a few good words? It's not easy to see someone giving silver dollars like this. If this young lady finds someone with a real heart like Mr. Cheng, then she will have a lifelong reliance." As he said this, he again assumed that hesitant attitude, holding a cigarette between two fingers and stretching it out to the side, tapping the middle finger on the cigarette, his eyes glancing at Yueying. Cheng Zhiqian raised his head and laughed heartily, "That's a joke. Using small favors to buy people's hearts, that's what Cao Cao and Wang Mang did. I gave these two dollars to Auntie Hu because I was afraid she would have such a misunderstanding. I had already stated in advance that she didn't need to talk to me about this young lady's affairs. I feel that when a person is born between heaven and earth, it is a very sad thing to repay someone's kindness with their body. If you give kindness to someone and hope that they will repay you with their body, that is causing them pain, which is ten times more hateful than not giving them kindness." Yueying was sitting on the side, and originally she had stopped crying. Hearing such thorough words, her heart was moved, and she started sobbing again. Zhiqian said, "You don't need to cry! Everyone has times when they are down on their luck. As long as you are patient and work slowly, sooner or later there will be a day when you get ahead. This Little Western Paradise, as Auntie Hu said, has upper, middle, and lower classes, it is a place of right and wrong. You should go back." (108)</p>
<h3 id="e259">The Discovery of the Jade Milk Well <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— By Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>The Jade Milk Well is a recent discovery in Nanjing. Just looking at the three characters "Jade Milk Well," we can tell that it is no ordinary ancient well!</p>
<p>The discovery happened like this: About ten li outside of Zhonghua Gate, there is Ande Gate, originally a Ming Dynasty outer city. Next to that city, there is a small earthen hill, which also has a fragrant name, called "Jade Ring Hill." On this hill, there are dozens of houses, all inhabited by farmers, and there is also a flowery temple, Xinglong Temple, which was also built in the Ming Dynasty. However, because it is relatively far from the city, people in the city rarely know about this place.</p>
<p>Recently, the abbot of Xinglong Temple, Jihang, saw a small dirt mound made of garbage behind the temple, which was really not very elegant, so he called a few villagers to move it away. Who knew that after leveling this small dirt mound, the "Jade Milk Well" was discovered! So Abbot Jihang spent a few more coins to remove the mud from the well, and thus this ancient well was completely revealed!</p>
<p>The Jade Milk Well is entirely built of alunite stone, and the patterns are very delicate. Above the well, the characters "Jade Milk Well" and "Rebuilt in the Fifteenth Year of Yongle" are engraved. The bottom of the well is also made of alunite stone, with several small holes on it in the style of plum blossoms. The well water emerges from these small holes, initially as very clear water, and then after a while, it turns into water that is the same as human milk! That's why it is called "Jade Milk Well." According to Abbot Jihang, the water tastes fragrant and sweet, and if it is used to brew tea, it is truly a unique flavor!</p>

<p>The lazier a person is, the more hopes he has, and the greater his fantasies are. A diligent striver has simple hopes, aiming for just one goal.</p>
<p>People who commit suicide are not to be pitied, because they have already stopped pitying themselves.</p>
<p>The more a precious sword is used, the sharper it becomes. The same is true of the human mind.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Seller of Chickens <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Drunken Simpleton</p>
<p>When winter arrives, in the streets and alleys, there are always villagers carrying loads on shoulder poles, calling out to sell chickens, to meet the needs of the residents.</p>
<p>The price of chickens is truly cheap this year: in previous years, one yuan could only buy two or three catties, but now one yuan can buy four or five catties (four catties for hens, five catties for roosters). And it's weighed on a full sixteen-tael scale. This is probably a manifestation of rural bankruptcy!</p>
<p>If you buy a few more of these cheap chickens, intending to raise them for future needs, you'll only be fooled and suffer a loss. Because these chickens often make strange noises after a day or two. Their combs also change from red to purplish-black, and they may even stop eating and moving. If you don't slaughter them at this time, they might just die of old age. But what's the reason for this? You only need to slaughter the chicken and cut it open to understand. Because its crop will be particularly swollen. The food inside is undigested, or mixed with mud and sand. This is the reason for its strange cries: these chicken vendors, to increase the weight of the chickens, stuff them with food in advance. They turn perfectly good chickens into a state of dying. These cruel methods are truly hateful. Now, the animal protection society initiated by philanthropists in this city is trying to protect all kinds of animals. For example, if someone carries a chicken upside down in the concession, if the police see it, they will be detained in the police station and punished. Compassion for animals can be said to be thorough. But the above-mentioned practice of forcibly stuffing chickens with food is still impossible to prohibit.</p>

<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"In the past, martial arts were very important! For a leader, in addition to handling all the government affairs of the court, hunting was also an important task that could not be neglected. It was necessary to hold it from time to time." The Empress Dowager was praising the ancestors' martial achievements again. As usual, we were all listening very attentively. When he went hunting, he brought a lot of people, because we Manchus never used hunting dogs when hunting, so he had to bring more people to help him search for wild animals. These wild animals - mostly tigers and leopards - were captured in advance, kept in large cages, and then released temporarily. ...</p>
<p>"Because this hunting ground is far from the city, the emperors were already very tired from riding all the way to get here, so they would definitely rest in this palace first; while he was resting, his entourage would be busy tidying up the horses, tightening the bowstrings, and sharpening all the arrowheads one by one. In addition, the precious sword that the emperor carried with him also had to be sharpened to maintain its sharpest state, so that it would not fail in case it was needed.</p>
<p>"You must know that the situation at that time was absolutely different from now: Manchus were all brave and fierce, strong and able to fight, and the most important thing was the spirit of martial arts; therefore, a leader who wants to rule his people cannot rely entirely on empty words or clever means, but must have a strong physique, be able to be familiar with martial arts, and be able to go to the battlefield. At the very least, he must not be weaker than any of his people; in other words, he must at least be as strong and brave as his people. (218)</p>

<h3 id="e265">My Peach and Plum Calamity <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Late Evening Chamber Owner</p>
<p>(Preface) Recently, I saw a movie called "Peach and Plum Calamity," which is a tragedy of students. Moved by old events, I wrote it down as follows:</p>
<p>During the middle years of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, I pioneered the atmosphere in Guanzhong, such as newspapers and lectures, which were all my creations; and I especially devoted myself to primary school education, and the school I founded was named Gan Garden; at that time, the atmosphere had not yet opened up, and people called it "Foreign School"; however, in the first year of its start, the number of students who came to study had reached several hundreds, which was not easy; among them, there was a son of Mr. Zhou from Zhejiang, named Chengen, who was eleven years old. Mr. Zhou had a late-born son, who was intelligent and studious, and I loved him very much. He had an older sister who was several years older than Chengen, who was beautiful and intelligent, and also once asked my wife to teach her how to read; After more than a year, Mr. Zhou had a close relative who was an official in Fengxiang, and invited Mr. Zhou to assist in the government affairs. Mr. Zhou left his family in the provincial capital for his son's education, and went to the office alone. More than a year later, one day in school class, the roll call did not find Zhou Chengen. Just as I was about to send someone to ask about it, someone from Zhou's family came to ask for Chengen's sick leave. I felt uneasy. After class, I went to visit him and saw that his fever was very high. I told his family to pay special attention and report his recovery as soon as possible. After a few days, he did not come again. When asked, the illness was severe and dangerous, and he was talking nonsense, and he talked about school affairs a lot; and he occasionally said in his words: "Teacher Yan is here, you should entertain him quickly. ......" I felt sad when I heard it! I went to see him again and saw that his mind was confused. When he saw me coming, his eyes were piercing and he turned over to kowtow. My tears burst out! He died the next day. His mother and sister, considering that Mr. Zhou was old and only had this one son, were afraid of hurting his heart, so they went to Mr. Zhou's office and falsely said that they would leave their son in school and leave everything to me to take care of. After several years, his mother also died. Mr. Zhou felt that it was inconvenient for the father and daughter to live alone, so he took his daughter back to the province. As soon as the luggage was unloaded, his daughter secretly sent someone to tell me, and asked me to only say that Chengen had been sent to a certain school in Shanghai because he was very busy with his work and could not return immediately, and planned to send him abroad to study, intending to spend his father's remaining years in this way. After a while, Mr. Zhou came and thanked me earnestly, saying that he was deeply grateful for sending his son to Shanghai to study, and that he would ask about everything by registered mail; I did not answer because it was inconvenient, so I said yes. After a few days, his daughter came to my house gracefully, and said as soon as she entered the door: "I came to kowtow to the teacher and his wife especially," and then talked about Chengen, and asked again as before; and looked at my house back and forth, and asked about everything in detail, because my second son had just lost his wife at that time, and his father planned to propose marriage to my family. The next day, a matchmaker was sent to his house, but because I had not asked for my second son's consent, I could not agree immediately. At the meeting, Mr. Zhou's enemy knew about it and made slanderous remarks to my second son, and the young son was ignorant and fell into his trap! The marriage proposal was aborted. And Zhou's daughter suffered a serious illness due to disappointment. At that time, Mr. Zhou's letter sent to Shanghai was returned because there was no such school in Shanghai; Mr. Zhou spoke out and said, "Where did Yan put my son? He is deceiving me, I will sue him." The daughter was critically ill, and in a daze, she suddenly sobered up and said to her father generously: "I am critically ill and cannot get up! My brother Chengen died of a certain disease on a certain day of a certain year, and was buried in a certain place. The false statement about seeking knowledge is to keep the old father's heart at peace; this has nothing to do with the Yan family, so don't ask." After she finished speaking, she passed away. Mr. Zhou still thought it was a confused order in the illness, and after asking many old roommates, he believed it. The next day, Mr. Zhou came and said to me: "My son died early, and my family kept it from me. If my daughter had not told me directly before her death, I would have wronged you! "Later, Mr. Zhou, as an old man in his seventies, had no other worries, and returned to the south alone, and there was no news, and I don't know where he ended up.</p>

<p>Student National Goods Year Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e266">Let's All Pick Up This Load Together <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>This year is the Student National Goods Year. Having the purest, most hardworking, and most patriotic students to do the work of promoting national goods and using national goods is, of course, the most appropriate and effective.</p>
<p>Silver flows in torrents, Foreign goods pour in,</p>
<p>How to stop the leakage? Work hard on national goods.</p>
<p>To save the panic of silver outflow, thousands of methods are not as effective and successful as working hard on promoting national goods and using national goods. Young students, from literate children to university students, and even old students who used to be students, should start from this year and enthusiastically engage in it. Mr. Huang Renzhi said: "I am also a member of the Student National Goods Year, because I have also been a student. The older I get, the better my enthusiasm." This spirit can be a model for our young people.</p>
<p>Chinese people should use Chinese goods,</p>
<p>From adults to children, from men to women,</p>
<p>Everyone should enthusiastically do it.</p>
<p>Don't let last year be the women's responsibility,</p>
<p>And this year only let the students do it.</p>
<p>As a result, you push me and I push you,</p>
<p>It must be a mess.</p>
<p>Originally, the so-called National Goods Year is just to mark a name to advocate the use of national goods by people all over the country. It does not mean that the National Goods Year of that sector only relies on the efforts of that sector and holds that sector responsible. Last year was "Women's National Goods Year," so did the men not have any responsibility and could use foreign goods? This year is "Student National Goods Year," so does it mean that the women's responsibility has been fulfilled and they don't have to use national goods anymore? I often say: this year is the first year of "Student National Goods Year," which is also the second year of "Women's National Goods Year," and the third year of "National Goods Year." Someone said well: everyone should recognize that this year is not just "Student National Goods Year," students should also use national goods. It is even more necessary to recognize that in "Student National Goods Year," it is not just those who are students who should use national goods. In short, using national goods and promoting national goods are the responsibility of everyone who is enthusiastic and everyone who is Chinese, and everyone must work hard. The opinions of many students below are enough for everyone to understand.</p>
<p>All Chinese people use Chinese goods, regardless of which year, work hard to move forward, children to adults, husbands to women, not you and me, not poor and rich, share the burden together, everyone is responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e267">The Future of the Student National Goods Year <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhizhong, Journalism Department, Shanghai University</p>
<p>The most unfortunate people in the world are those who are unfortunately mute and patients with paralysis, because although they have limbs and facial features, they cannot move freely and say what they want to say like normal healthy people.</p>
<p>It's really pitiful to say that our country, restricted by objective facts, has also become mute, an unfortunate paralytic:!! Leaving aside the great truth that enemies have occupied our territory by force, and we should recover it by force, other countries use long-term economic aggression as a means to control our lives, and trap us in the current terrible fact that the country is broken, the family is destroyed, the people are poor, and the wealth is exhausted, we can't even shout out the slogan of resisting goods, and the movement of resisting goods is also quite silent. Aren't we as unfortunate and pitiful as the mute and the paralytic?!! Although the annual "National Goods Year" is held in response to the needs of objective facts, it undertakes the work of increasing the production of national goods, reducing the import surplus of foreign goods, and resisting the dumping of foreign goods.</p>
<p>Last year was called "Women's National Goods Year." Women and national goods manufacturers also worked hard. National goods exhibitions were held in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Changsha, Yichang, and Xi'an. Fashion conferences were also performed in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. But what was the result? Japanese goods were still dumped in China in large quantities. The trade import surplus from January to October last year reached a huge 430 million yuan. And the crisis of national industries is becoming more and more acute. The silk industry has declined, and the textile industry has also declined. Other industries such as the rubber industry, match industry, cement industry, enamel industry, woolen industry, thermos bottle industry, oil production industry, and umbrella industry are still in the same depression.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>This is, very obviously, under the shackles of unequal treaties and under the system where tariffs cannot be completely independent, the immature national industry is destroyed by the capitalism of the great powers with advanced capital and technology, and is forced to the desperate situation of exhaustion day by day.</p>
<p>However, national goods still need to be promoted after all, and national industries still need people to always love and protect them. If we wait until unequal treaties are lifted and tariffs are completely independent before we promote and protect them, then, capitalists from the East and the West may have already earned all the foreign money in our pockets! Our purchasing power is reduced to only enough to drink wind.</p>
<p>It is said that a monk asked: "How about taking three steps forward?" The answer is: "Bumping your head against the forehead!" "How about taking three steps back?" "A fall of a thousand feet!" "How about not advancing and not retreating?" "Die on the spot!"</p>
<p>The economic crisis we are suffering now is so serious and unavoidable. If we don't want to die and don't want to fall a thousand feet, then, we have to rush forward with our heads, and the way is: work hard for complete tariff autonomy, complete abolition of unequal treaties, and modernization and rational management of industry. Although this work may be head-scratching.</p>
<p>This year is the Student National Goods Year. Students, national goods manufacturers, and all the people, let us unite and work together!</p>
<h3 id="e268">Ten Commandments for the Student National Goods Year <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen, National Shanghai College of Commerce</p>
<p>People at that time had a pessimistic view of the future of the national goods industry, which was due to the fact that the national goods movement was not promoted properly, and the effectiveness was also minimal. The National Goods Year has passed, and industry and commerce have become more and more depressed! The Women's National Goods Year has passed, and the import of foreign cosmetics, perfumes, and other women's products has not decreased compared to previous years, but has even increased! Learning from the past, we promote this year as the Student National Goods Year. If we are like in the past, those who promote it will promote it, and those who are involved will despise it, then the result can be predicted. Sad loss! The national spirit is so weak, can the future of China's national economy have hope of moving towards a bright realm? Our students are excellent members of the people, and the responsibility of national revival is placed on their shoulders. The rise of the national goods movement should begin with the Student National Goods Year.</p>
<p>After the war, Germany's industry and commerce declined internally, and was heavily in debt externally. It was not accidental that it completed economic recovery in a few years! This is probably because the German people's love of country is superior to other races. After the Germans suffered a disastrous defeat in the European war, they sought the revival of industry and commerce, and formulated the so-called "Ten Commandments of Industry," and the revitalization of the national goods industry depended on this. With the failure of past national goods movements in mind, I have exhausted my foolish sincerity and drafted the Ten Commandments of the Student National Goods Year after several deliberations to show my comrades. Its text is;</p>
<p>(1) National stationery is both cheap and beautiful. All my students should try their best to advocate its use.</p>
<p>(2) Physical education can strengthen the body, and using national sports equipment can save the country.</p>
<p>(3) Before your body loses its freedom, you should wear national clothing.</p>
<p>(4) Eating domestic products can cultivate patriotism.</p>
<p>(5) If you have a penny, you must deposit it in a domestic bank.</p>
<p>(6) When you travel, do not take foreign merchant ships.</p>
<p>(7) When you watch movies, do not enter foreign cinemas, and do not watch foreign films.</p>
<p>(8) Every time you spend a penny, you must take the welfare of the country as your guide.</p>
<p>(9) You must persuade your relatives and friends to use national goods every day.</p>
<p>(10) You must reflect on yourself every day whether you have violated the "Ten Commandments of National Goods"</p>
<p>Today, China's national industry and commerce are on the verge of exhaustion. Even in Shanghai, which is the most prosperous in the country, factories that have stopped work account for almost half of the total, and several shops close down every day. If this continues, what will happen? Saving the country and seeking survival, promoting national goods is the most urgent task. We are all outstanding students, and in the past we were known as traitors to national goods. Today, we should work hard to encourage ourselves to atone for our sins. Germany's past can be learned from, and we are already too late to catch up. Alas! Following the old ways and sticking to the old ways will only lead to self-destruction. It is time to drastically change our past mistakes and vigorously whip the horse at night to save ourselves. I urge my comrades not to ignore my words</p>
<h3 id="e269">Dedicated to Female Students in Universities Across the Country <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hou Wanru, Jinling Women's University</p>
<p>Sisters! We are fortunate. In this time of national crisis and economic panic, we have actually entered the university. How happy should we be? At the same time, how great is our responsibility? And how deep is the expectation of our fathers and brothers for us? Therefore, how should we work hard to move forward?</p>
<p>The education we receive is superior to that of ordinary female compatriots. We are receiving special cultivation. How should we work hard ourselves? So as not to fail the expectations of our fathers, brothers, and the country! Now, the twenty-fourth year has begun. The society solemnly handed over the responsibility of promoting national goods to students across the country, and designated this year as the Student National Goods Year. Then, how should we, who are receiving university education, take on this mission? To promote the conformity of the Student National Goods Year with its name!</p>
<p>Sisters studying in universities, the family economy can at least survive, so female students in universities do not need to worry about the source of economy. (Of course, there are also exceptions) Therefore, many students fall into extravagance, and the bad habit of using foreign goods naturally develops. Sisters! Let us check ourselves. In our dormitory and washroom, are most of the cosmetics and utensils displayed national goods? Or foreign goods? I think everyone will inevitably feel ashamed? However, the past has become the past, and the future can still be pursued. Let us start from today, take on the responsibility of our Student National Goods Year, and drastically change our past mistakes.</p>
<p>People in our society generally believe that students are more promising and have more dignity than other classes, especially college students; because very few of us Chinese can receive proper education, students' actions are very willing to be modeled by others, especially female students' clothing. There are many facts that can prove this: just taking the wearing of blue cloth shirts as an example, blue cloth clothes were originally worn by rural women, and ladies in the city are absolutely unwilling to use blue cloth as clothing material, but later this kind of blue cloth was designated as school uniforms by the school authorities. At that time, the students opposed it. I was still in middle school at that time, and I remember that many students united and formally protested to the training director, saying: "We don't agree to wear blue cloth shirts and black skirts, because it looks like fishmongers, and we don't want to wear blue cloth robes, because it looks like tailors; if we must wear school uniforms, we would rather wear gray ones." But the school authorities did not agree, and there was a regulation that "not wearing school uniforms will be regarded as absenteeism."</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>So the students had to put them on hatefully, and after a long time, women in society started wearing blue cloth shirts, and gradually, blue cloth shirts simply became the most modern clothes. Do women in society want to be fishmongers or tailors? No, that's because people in society admire students and imitate them. Therefore, we believe that the clothing of female students, especially university students, has a great influence on social customs. Sisters! Why don't we use this kind of power? On the one hand, we can save our fathers and brothers' money, and on the other hand, we are good students who use national goods. Moreover, among cosmetics, national goods are much better than Three Flowers. Among the supplies, Minsheng ink is not necessarily worse than Waterman, but the price is much cheaper. Why must we send money to foreign countries and receive the gift of their artillery fire?</p>
<p>Sisters! We are standing on the upper layer of the intellectual class, and we all have considerable national concepts. From now on, we will correct the bad habit of using foreign goods if we have it, and encourage ourselves if we don't have it, so as not to fail the expectations of society for us</p>
<h3 id="e270">Understanding of the Student National Goods Year <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Naibin, Provincial Shanghai Middle School</p>
<p>The twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China is the Student National Goods Year, and we are students, so we should understand it clearly.</p>
<p>Last year was the Women's National Goods Year, why did it fail? Is it because they didn't know that using foreign goods would send their money to foreign capitalists? No, they know it. I think the most noteworthy thing is their "psychological morbidity," they often think that using foreign goods is a glorious thing! A large number of foreign goods are sold!</p>
<p>Due to the weaknesses of the past, we should improve, that is, we must first get rid of this "psychological morbidity"! Don't think that using foreign goods is a glorious thing. On the contrary, using national goods is a glorious thing! We should also know that except for us students, who else can understand the economic organization of this era? Imperialists use their treaty privileges to sell their surplus production at discounted prices, and national goods are naturally not easy to develop! But we students, we understand the most important key, that is, as long as everyone does not buy foreign goods, are we still afraid that national goods will not sell well?</p>
<p>After recognizing this, this Student National Goods Year will not fail like last year.</p>
<p>Well, students across the country, put it into practice, just talking is suicide!</p>
<h3 id="e271">Student National Goods Year and "Recognition of Shame" <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bailu, Nanyang Middle School</p>
<p>The past Women's National Goods Year gave us a historical lesson: the so-called ×× National Goods Year was the year ×× got scolded. Similarly, this year is when our students will be scolded. It is said that last year, 70 to 80% of women's imported goods were sold to Shanghai women with the highest cultural standards. Therefore, using the fact that the higher the cultural standard, the more imported goods are used, to lead to this year's Student National Goods Year, I firmly believe that before the end of this year, the voices of us being scolded will definitely be more than what women experienced last year. Therefore, at the starting point of today's Student National Goods Year, I would like to talk about the recognition of shame, with the heartfelt intention of hoping for the future.</p>
<p>Students have never been able to clearly recognize shame. They think it is shameful to buy domestic goods, but they have never thought that buying British, American, etc. goods is equally shameful. They think that certain foreign shops should never be entered. Even when they have to buy a foreign book, they are still afraid of being seen by others, secretly sneaking into the ×× bookstore, and then quickly slipping out. But when they go to Bata to buy leather shoes, they walk in with their heads held high and slowly carry the shoe box out. The former and the latter seem completely different.</p>
<p>Sometimes when a classmate buys a bottle of Minsheng ink, they say, "Minsheng ink is too lousy, not as good as Waterman." They think it is shameful to use Minsheng ink. So they secretly pour it into an empty Waterman ink bottle. When classmates use Guan Le Min, Dr., and other brands of fountain pens, they don't often take them out to use, not because they cherish their pens, but because they are afraid that classmates will laugh at this "lousy domestic product." Using this "lousy domestic product" is shameful, so they hide it.</p>
<p>The above are just a few examples, from which we can clearly see the shame of students. Taking shame as no shame, and no shame as shame, this is what has led to the demise of the national goods industry.</p>
<p>Our students are the leaders of everything. We should not slightly lose people's respect, and then be唾駡by them. Before buying any goods, we should, based on our own identity and the environment of our times, clearly distinguish between what is shameful and what is not.</p>
<p>We originally have the power, we originally have brains. Friends, on New Year's Eve this year (no, not just this year), let's see our achievements.</p>
<p>New News from the National Goods Industry in a Week</p>
<p>The Student National Goods Year opened on New Year's Day of the 24th year in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Investigation of Daily Necessities of College and Middle School Students <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Geng, Sino-French Vocational School</p>
<p>This year is the Student National Goods Year. In order to do some practical work this year, I investigated the daily necessities of many college and middle school students. The result is that 60-70% of them are foreign goods. The most common ones are:</p>
<p>Stationery! Ink, fountain pens. Most students use Waterman American ink, and fountain pens are Conklin, Parker, Cade, etc. National goods ink includes Dahua, Minsheng, Liwen, etc., and national goods fountain pens include Guan Le Min, Xinmin, Huafu, etc., but they are still no match for the popularity of foreign goods.</p>
<p>Instruments. We rarely see national goods instruments. Most of the ones they use are produced by the German Faber factory.</p>
<p>Sports equipment, musical instruments! In their spare time, middle school and college students have to play sports or music, but the sports equipment such as tennis rackets, baseball bats, football shoes, running shoes, jumping shoes, etc., and the various Western musical instruments they use are all foreign goods.</p>
<p>Other items such as toothpaste, belts, suits, hats, shoes, gloves, etc. are mostly foreign goods as well.</p>
<p>It has become a habit for middle school and college students to use foreign goods. They seem ashamed to use domestic goods. The reasons are: (1) a lack of trust in the concept of domestic goods; (2) differences in the material of foreign goods and domestic goods, such as instruments and stationery, domestic goods really cannot make people fully believe; (3) most middle school and college students are children of the bourgeoisie, and they have developed the habit of using foreign goods in their families since childhood; (4) a mentality of vanity.</p>
<p>Remedial methods are nothing more than: (1) establishing greater factories and producing more refined and accurate products; (2) organizing promotion of national goods and review committees within schools; (3) organizing consumer cooperatives to exclusively sell excellent American goods, so that students can avoid the trouble of shopping outside and can purchase national goods; (4) publicizing the advantages of national goods; (5) rewarding the solicitation of students to provide ways for national goods manufacturers to improve their products, etc.</p>
<p>Personal opinions are certainly not necessarily correct, and I hope that all parties will discuss them as much as possible.</p>

<p>The 24th year of the Republic of China is officially designated as the Student National Goods Year. The Student National Goods Year will certainly have its great manifestations. However, in this article, I want to raise a small topic, which is the stationery used by students.</p>
<p>The stationery of the Student National Goods Year is like the脂粉of the Women's National Goods Year. Women's脂粉has already attracted the attention of many people. We must advocate for national goods in the stationery used by students, and at the same time, use less foreign goods and no inferior goods.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about advocating for national goods. Take the author himself as an example. I myself must use Chinese stationery for my writing. I have translated an average of one book per year for the past two years. The manuscript paper I use is Chinese毛邊, Huizhou ink, and Huzhou brush. The stationery and envelopes I use to correspond with friends are also domestic goods. I feel that they are very elegant and very respectful to people. Some people often use foreign paper for writing manuscripts, which is not right. As for using foreign envelopes and foreign stationery to correspond with people, it feels even more disrespectful.</p>
<p>Second, let's talk about using less foreign goods. It is impossible to completely abolish foreign goods in stationery. For example, when traveling and conducting investigations, it is convenient to take notes at any time, so it is of course convenient to use pencils. However, it can be said that there are no domestic goods pencils, so foreign goods cannot be avoided. But it can certainly be used less. For example, you can use a毛筆when drafting indoors. Now students like to use foreign goods. Even when they can avoid it, they still happily use foreign goods. During this Student National Goods Year, I sincerely hope that they will change their approach.</p>
<p>Third, let's talk about not using inferior goods. Nowadays, some students love foreign goods, but they also dislike their high prices, so they choose to buy cheap stationery, and unknowingly use inferior goods. In fact, it is better not to buy them if you dislike the price. For example, you don't necessarily have to buy expensive fountain pens. But you should not buy cheap ones either. That's why I don't like this thing myself. I am always looking forward to China having a good fountain pen factory.</p>

<h3 id="e275">My Experience in Promoting National Goods <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Kaixi, School of Commerce, Great China University</p>
<p>For our country with backward production, promoting national goods has become a unanimous good method for saving the country and preserving its existence. For a nation to exist permanently in the world, its products must have the ability to be self-sufficient. Promoting national goods is to encourage the production of products and is bound to become a way to be self-sufficient. Based on this importance, I enthusiastically participate in the work, but it is definitely not a general empty promise. Below are the results of promoting my use and promotion of national goods: (A) Factors that promote the use of national goods:</p>
<p>(1) A good family that promotes national goods. My parents have received new education and baptism. They have a broad vision and full understanding, so their family education; for children's psychology, first of all, national goods are beautiful, and the habit of practical use is formed. Almost all daily necessities at home are first adopted with national goods as a prerequisite. Therefore, my brothers and sisters and I have developed my good habit of using national goods.</p>
<p>(2) The influence of the school atmosphere: Dr. Tai Shuangqiu, the dean of the School of Education of this school, advocates the土布movement, and many students participate in it. This has formed the simple style of the school. In this environment, I wear uniforms every day, which makes me energetic, convenient for work, and physically strong, while the expenses borne by the family are greatly reduced.</p>
<p>(B) Practice of promoting national goods:</p>
<p>(1) Introduce exquisite national goods to relatives and friends: When my family and I give gifts to relatives and friends for weddings and funerals, we give national goods or gift certificates from national goods companies. This way, we send them to them, so that they have a correct understanding of national goods and arouse their awareness.</p>
<p>(2) Correcting the wrong concepts with words: Since the Chinese people do not have a proper understanding of national goods, it is of course easy to have wrong views. Therefore, I often introduce the advantages of national goods in women's characters and contribute opinions on promotion:</p>
<p>1. Introduce the fineness and benefits of using national goods to people in the society.</p>
<p>2. Contribute opinions on the production of practical products to factories.</p>
<p>3. Correct and remedy the situation where an employee of a certain national goods company uses a foreign lead pencil (Chicken brand) instead of the national Dahua pencil.</p>
<p>4. Advocates that schools should wear uniforms to reduce the burden on families and to prevent students from entering舞塲and going to improper amusement塲.</p>
<p>The above is my good environment that promotes my use of national goods, and my experience in promoting national goods. This year is the Student National Goods Year. I hope that the督促of the論, the rewards and punishments of the government's education authorities, the preferential treatment of manufacturers, and the close connection between families and schools will monitor students to thoroughly use national goods. At the same time, I hope that students across the country will consciously and forever use national goods. We must know that using foreign goods is the most shameful thing!</p>

<h3 id="e276">Gold Price Falls Four Yuan Amidst Loose Financial Exchange <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>The Central Bank Opens Spot Market with Slight Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was favorable to buyers, and the exchange market was loose, causing people's hearts to be slightly tired, and the market fell back. The market situation in the first half of the day was still relatively stable, because the Central Bank had news of opening the spot market from time to time, so buyers repeatedly moved when the price was low, and the transaction was normal. The overall trend hovered around 70 yuan. It was found that the London gold and silver markets fell sharply in the early morning, with London raw gold falling by one便士. Exchange rates rose and fell, with reports that the 평시위원회 bought 20 million yuan of silver in Hong Kong and shipped it to Shanghai.

However, because the London sky条脚地is extremely hard, and it is said that the United States will add 0625 to the listed price and speculators will add 125 to buy, the big条will definitely return to long. In addition, the Associated Press reported that the US banks' collective discussion on paying dividends took unanimous action and requested Congress to increase the silver purchase program as soon as possible, which caused people's hearts to want to be good but were hindered. The pre-market transaction opened and retreated to about 70 yuan. Large households took advantage of the low price to enter again, gradually rising. However, the opening was still low.

After the opening, it was still stable, but because the exchange market was loose and downstream again, the banks had little appetite, the domestic market was even harder, and it broke through the 70 yuan mark. The banks took advantage of the cheap price to结, and were able to maintain it after the low price. The demand and supply in the market were uneven, and people's hearts were obviously fluctuating, so the market price struggled around 70 yuan. When the silver balance tax was announced, it fell by half a point, calculated as 5.75%. The English exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling 5便士59375.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange continued its firm and steady trend, showing signs of gradually climbing higher. This was due to the fact that the rumor of the Shanghai Municipal Council shipping back 20 million yuan of silver from Hong Kong was indeed true and would be realized within days. As a result, the foreign exchange rate fell to 3.5%, and even head notes were available at zero interest. This situation was a good sign unseen in recent weeks, especially considering the increasingly severe economic downturn and the approaching Lunar New Year. It was particularly commendable. Furthermore, there was a possibility of further easing in the foreign exchange rate. However, the general bears in the market still wanted to apply their usual tactic of high pressure, a phenomenon present in every transaction. But the market's robust momentum was already unstoppable. The trend would likely not see significant gains until these individuals changed their approach. Yesterday's gains, while not drastic, were extremely firm. Large bears continued to exert pressure, but the market price did not change. For example, in the morning's opening session, a large volume of No. 69 was sold, and bears added to their positions in No. 16, while Nos. 21 and 53, among others, showed strong buying interest. The market price still rose by about 0.2 to 0.3. The second session was relatively stagnant, but remained firm, continuing to improve by 0.05 to 0.15.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, head notes were available at zero interest, and market sentiment was boosted again. Buying interest from various groups was strong, and swap and short covering activities were very active. Long-term consolidated tax bonds surged by 0.45. No. 16 applied pressure again, but No. 4 took advantage of the situation to enter the market. Therefore, the upward trend remained firm. Trading at the close was significantly less active, with some closing out positions. Front positions were flat, middle positions were slightly weak, and back positions continued to rise. As a result, market prices rose by 0.1 to 0.2 to 0.5 to 0.6. The total transaction volume was 10,355,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are listed in the comparison table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a report from the Sin Fung Foreign Firm, yesterday (8th), the New York stock market was mixed and weak, but trading was still active. In the early morning, due to the Supreme Court's ruling, oil stocks were heavily sold. Later, oil-producing states claimed that the court's ruling did not mean that illegal oil could be produced in large quantities from now on, and oil stocks stabilized slightly. Steel stocks were strong. General Motors reported that its business in 1934 increased by 42.7% compared to 1933, but automobile stocks could only barely maintain their level. Some brokers expressed surprise at the banks' continuous absorption of government bonds. Furthermore, the implementation of Roosevelt's budget would inevitably lead to the issuance of government bonds, and the consequences of this significant expansion of bank credit also aroused curiosity among these brokers. The bond market showed mixed ups and downs. Stocks on the small exchange, except for oil stocks, mostly trended upwards. Chicago wheat was weak in the early morning, but rose due to short covering. The total trading volume for the day was 1.19 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is calm and lacks excitement. This is because the end of the Lunar New Year is approaching, and financial conditions are tight. Everyone is preparing to close out their positions, resulting in a rather bleak atmosphere in the market. Market price fluctuations are increasingly small. However, major bulls and bears are unwilling to take action unless there are special changes. Therefore, the amount of chips on the table feels particularly weak, and market fluctuations are even smaller.</p>

<p>The opening of the raw yarn market was relatively good due to a slight rise in foreign cotton. There were not many sellers, and prices for all months rose by 0.2 to 0.3. After two or three trading rounds, news that spot yarn transactions were sluggish and the cotton market was calm caused market prices to turn downwards again. As a result, near months fell by 0.1 to 0.3, and far months rose by 0.1. The afternoon remained quiet, and there were very few transactions in the market. However, there were rumors that a certain Mr. Wu was still buying in the current month, and the market price rose slightly by 0.2 to 0.3, with far months falling by 0.1 to 0.2. It was found that 450 bales of Dafu yarn were sold, 300 bales of Gengfeng yarn, 650 bales of Jun Chang yarn, 350 bales of Tongji yarn, 500 bales of Dafeng yarn, and 400 bales of Run Kang yarn. 300 bales of Mei Ji yarn, 1,450 bales of Changfeng yarn, 550 bales of Yu Da yarn, 250 bales of Dafu yarn, and 250 bales of Renfeng yarn were bought.

<p>The cotton market remained soft, and the yarn market was flat. With the settlement period approaching, operators were all watching and not moving. Overseas cotton markets were firm. Bulls, because the foreign cotton price ratio was still high, did not release their purchases. In the afternoon, the dark market for Indian cotton rose another 5 rupees 25.</p>

<p>The opening of the raw cotton market was slightly boosted by the continued rise in Indian and American cotton markets. Near months rose by 0.15. After two or three trading rounds, news that exchange rates were unchanged and gold prices were stable, while the yarn market was weak, caused market conditions to loosen again. However, trading was quite sparse. As a result, near months rose by 0.05, and far months fell by 0.05 to 0.1. The afternoon remained largely unchanged, with very few transactions between bulls and bears. At the close, the market was weaker, with all months falling by 0.05 to 0.1. It was found that 3,800 piculs of Changfeng cotton were sold, 1,600 piculs of Fu cotton, 600 piculs of Bu Ji cotton, 500 piculs of Yi Kang cotton, and 500 piculs of Yuan Xingchang cotton. 600 piculs of Dafu cotton, 2,400 piculs of Xincheng cotton, 1,200 piculs of Yu Da cotton, 1,300 piculs of Xinheng cotton, and 1,000 piculs of Changhe cotton were bought.

<p>Cotton Board Inflow Gradually Decreasing</p>
<p>Worldwide Cotton Production Further Reduced</p>
<p>Washington, 8th: Johnston, manager of the Cotton Board, announced today that the current stock of spot cotton is 1,617,932 bales, and the cotton futures for May, July, and October are 20,900 bales. According to Johnston's opinion, at the current market price, cotton holders are unlikely to have a large number of cotton certificates flowing into the Cotton Board, and the average daily inflow has recently decreased by 200 bales. Washington, 8th: The worldwide cotton production in 1934, as estimated by the US Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Economics, is 23,000,000 bales, a decrease of 200,000 bales from the November estimate and a decrease of 3,100,000 bales from the 1933 production.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened. Due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, bulls closed out positions, and Southerners sold short. There were not many outside buyers. All months fell slightly by 1 to 3 points. Later, Johnston released information about the Cotton Board (see below), and dealers bought in and shorts covered, causing the market price to recover. Currently, both sides are waiting, so the market remains in a fluctuating state. The close was firm, with spot goods rising by 5 points and futures rising by 3 to 5 points. The last month fell by 1 point. The British cotton market was stable, with spot goods rising by 2 points and futures rising by 3 to 5 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to bull liquidation, but recovered as European exporters' sales were absorbed by short covering. As a result, Pingguo Er fell by 7.5 jiao, Aomula rose by 2.25 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (8th telegram):</p>

<p>Another report from the Sin Fung Foreign Firm stated that news from Washington regarding cotton suggested that government cotton would not be released again at the current prices, leading to buying in the afternoon. Democratic Senator Adams said that the unconstitutionality of oil restrictions would eventually be applied to agricultural products. This year's production is expected to be approximately 13 million bales.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for all months presented an initial stable followed by a declining trend. Foreign wheat quotations were lower in Chicago by 0.25 to 0.10, and Canadian wheat was better by around 0.08. When prices opened, trading for all months remained flat. Sales of current months were still active, with prices opening at 0.51125. By the second session, as trading remained quiet and there was little competition from buyers and sellers, some bulls slightly sold out, so the market also fell back by 0.01. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market for all months appeared weak. Because there were also sellers of spot foreign wheat, it was heard that a certain factory had continued to order a ship at a price of 4.86 yuan, so the market slightly sold short, and market sentiment gradually fell back. However, the number of sales was not smooth, and the decline only reached about 0.02. There were fewer inflows and outflows of new June flour, and the decline was also small. As a result, the current month fell by 0.01125 compared to the previous day, February fell by 0.015, March fell by 0.025, April fell by 0.02075, May fell by 0.01075, and June fell by 0.01.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market presented a stable and fluctuating trend after the opening in the morning. Foreign wheat quotations were lower in Chicago by 0.04 to 0.10, and Canadian wheat was better by around 0.08. When prices opened, as the market's trading was not smooth and buying interest was slightly quiet, the market for all months declined by 0.01 to 0.02. When the market opened in the afternoon, as the flour market was firm and then flat, and it was heard that there were transactions of spot foreign wheat on the market, market sentiment weakened, and market conditions entered a loosening path. Judging from the current situation, if foreign wheat continues to be ordered, when it is put into the standard in the future, the market may be difficult to become popular. As a result, January and February fell by 0.03, and March fell by 0.06. The spot wheat market remained stable, but with limited inventory, sales were not smooth. Shandong Suzhou wheat opened at 4.04 yuan, and secondary grade at 4.02 yuan, a total of 3,500 bags, which were taken by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat had a large number of sales at 1.02, which dampened the upward trend. Winter wheat brought heavy rain to the southwest, and the need for closing before the close disappeared. Later, speculators slightly sold off on the market.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) The sources from various groups were surprisingly prosperous in the drizzling rain, with more than fifty vendors arriving (nearly 10,000 dan of goods in total). The market color inevitably changed abruptly from activity to mediocrity. As the sellers once lowered prices, the market situation felt even more sluggish. Various dealers purchased four to five hundred bags, but the downward trend was difficult to contain. Therefore, as for late rice, in addition to those expecting to plummet by more than 0.1, the middle market price has suddenly fallen to 0.3. The thick japonica rice relied on sources being less inferior, slightly revising the scale. Du Yangjian, due to the lack of goods, still had no market. Yin Bianyuan still had no change. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten sources from various inland groups arrived at the Hexia wharf, with about 200 ships stored in the river. In terms of market sales, although the weather had cleared in Tiangong, Bai Chang was still being sold. There were many inquiries about pushing Yangjian. The market shape was that high-end white japonica rice was fixed, and medium and lower grades were fatigued by a small number of points. The price of thin rice was close to 0.1 lower. The price of Yangjian was strong. There was not much increase or decrease in Bianyuan Du wharf guest rice.</p>

<p>Guest Xiang Arrives in Small Quantities and Stays Flat; Foreign Rice Returns and Sales are Competitive</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for Guest Xiang was that inland demand was weak, but demand in this street was still strong, and there were inquiries from Chongsha, so the market could stand relatively firm. More than 3,000 bags were sold citywide, and most of them were handled by Yamamoto Street. More than 50,000 bags of foreign rice were newly imported by the Freighter Freck ship (this ship was delayed due to wind resistance last time). New arrivals were still arriving on the same day, and market sentiment had already become weak. The merchants who had purchased in the previous days were also eager to sell. Because the market had been active based on this guest last time, the market could stand relatively firm. In the afternoon, all parties sold back, and foreign merchants also had 500 tons of new transactions, so the market immediately fell sharply. The opening selling price for April Saigon was 5 yuan in the morning, and it dropped to 4.89 yuan in the afternoon, but there were still no buyers. If the inflow of merchants is not strong now and tomorrow, it will still need to step down. The opening price for January Saigon was 4.85 yuan in the morning, and there were no inquiries at 4.75 yuan in the afternoon. The spot price for Saigon fell to 11 yuan in the afternoon, and the market shape was still shaky.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Oil Market - White Tung Oil Foreign Sales Uninterrupted <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>Since the end of the year, the Hankou market sold white tung oil to foreign merchants at 31 yuan per dan according to foreign regulations. In the first three or four days of the New Year, because foreign firms stopped trading, the market has been unchanged in recent days, and trading has continued at the same price. However, the first month's futures that were previously sold short have reached their delivery period, and most of them are delivered in the producing areas. Therefore, the arrival of goods in Hankou is extremely rare. Only a few hundred pieces of Xiangtung were opened at a price of about 26 yuan. However, because too many futures were sold short to foreign firms, there is a delivery period every month, so the source in Hankou in the future is unlikely to surge in, and the market is also not easy to become too cheap. For this reason, the situation is very stable. The business of foreign merchants in this port is also continuously uninterrupted, but they are all small numbers of retail sales, and the market rarely pays attention. Recently, a certain miscellaneous grain store, which has always been engaged in exporting tung oil, has heard of finishing sufficient goods in Hangzhou at a price of 26.4 yuan per load, with shipping included. There should be a market for them, and the previously sold short futures have probably reached their delivery period. From this point of view, it is also difficult for Zhejiang tung to return to small size. However, domestic sales are quiet, and the settlement period is approaching in an instant, so people are more likely to wait and see.</p>

<p>Daylily, recently, the market price has been stubbornly defended, so the trend has become increasingly stronger. Yesterday, I heard that a dealer in the same industry opened at a price of 23.5 yuan for top-grade vegetables, and 20 yuan for ordinary goods. A small number of Zhenjiang merchants also opened, with a price of 20.2 yuan, which is 2-3 yuan more than the previous market price. The market price for top-grade vegetables is 24 yuan, and the rest are reduced accordingly.</p>

<p>Hardware transactions are approaching the end of the year, and there is no big business. Such as British steel plate, galvanized iron, garden wire, cut iron, new lead wire, etc., all go downstream, so the price has fallen by 0.05 to 0.12. However, Hunan pure antimony is still in short supply, so the market price is still as high as 850 yuan, but there are not many transactions. Only the investigation yesterday showed that the goods opened on the market included 200 barrels of nails, more than 140 boxes of tinplate, 50 pieces of angle iron, more than 100 dan of blue lead, 230-40 bundles of galvanized iron sheet, 300 dan of new foreign yuan, more than 30 dan of tin solder, and 310 bundles of black iron sheet. Although there are other openings, many are small. The buyers were found to be the Yangtze River, inland river, and Fuzhou groups. The Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao groups have not heard of any transactions this week.</p>

<h3 id="e319">On the Form of Poetry <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Junhan</p>
<p>Poetry is a product of society.</p>
<p>The most important issue in poetry is the content and the form. I have always believed that the consistency of content and form is an absolutely unbreakable topic. It is generally believed that this kind of consistency presupposes contradiction and is incompatible. But this is a mistake. Literature must explain that the law of literature is whole, a social function, a special superstructure, but its explanation must include the question of form.</p>
<p>The form I am talking about here has nothing to do with formalism. The theory of formalism is closely related to formalist art. The most important mistake of formalism is that it separates art from the complexity of modern society. The analysis of form is indeed useful and indispensable, but formalists regard it as an unquestionable truth.</p>
<p>In order to demand consistency between the content and form of a work, we cannot ignore the issues of heritage inheritance and proficient artistic skills. Then we must ask how we can learn from past masters or ancient books? To answer this question, we must know that negation is not a simple process of destruction, but a form of rebirth. Hegel said it well, "The ancients existed in existing forms." Although inheritance is possible, destruction is actually inevitable.</p>
<p>Now, if we review the poetry of the past and compare it with the great content of real life, then the content of poetry is bleak. Our poetry has not yet reached a level that can understand the entire significance of our era.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot ignore the subject matter of poetry. That is to say, the subject matter in poetry must be suitable for the complexity of our era and all its contradictions. Taking subject matter from this point of view will achieve consistency.</p>
<p>If we need a variety of poetic materials, it is not difficult to understand that, according to the combination of form and content, a variety of poetic forms are necessary.</p>
<p>The rhythm of an elegy cannot be the same as the rhythm of a military song, because the reaction of the image is also the content of its emotions. However, if we admit that a variety of poetic materials are appropriate, the result is a variety of poetic forms. In such a situation, what is the driving force of formal consistency? If there is true consistency between form and content, then the consistency of subject matter must be in harmony with the consistency of form, which goes without saying. This repeated consistency will be obtained through consistency of style or consistency of method.</p>
<p>The forms created by poetry should be diverse. Their consistency comes from the same great style or from the social realist method.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Yu Dafu's talk about poetry mentioned new and old poems. According to his opinion, whether new poetry can be established is still a question, and even teaches people not to do it; as for old poetry, according to the historical procedure, "as long as Chinese characters do not change, fashionable young people wearing Western clothes and drinking brandy will definitely hum some five-character and seven-character verses to pass the time." The person who wrote this article completely ignored the issue of consistency between the content and form of poetry; he only expressed his narrow prejudice.</p>

<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>Like magpies who love to build new nests and can't live on a tree for half a month, I am also such a restless guy, always dreaming of soaring through the sky, so I live everywhere for a month or so. Fortunately, it's so easy for a single person to move.</p>
<p>Recently, I carried my net basket and bedding into the empty backyard of this old house again. The bald trees and dead grass in the yard made people feel refreshed, although I couldn't see flowers or fruits. It was the gloomy demon king driving away the winter of the world.</p>
<p>At night, when I opened my bedding and spread it on the ground alone under the lamp, I suddenly heard a few coughs from the empty rooms a few rooms to the south, as if it took a lot of effort. After coughing, I hummed. It was clearly an old man. But I remembered that those rooms were empty, so I shivered one after another. Wrapped in the quilt, I thought of the fox fairies that people usually talked about. Fox fairies live in quiet corners, with white beards hanging from their cheeks, shaking their furry tails as they walk, coughing lightly.</p>
<p>That night, I dreamed of a group of big foxes and little foxes with a foxy smell.</p>
<p>The next morning, I ran to the outer courtyard to inquire with the tenants there.</p>
<p>"A retired soldier lives there. Don't be afraid. He's very kind," she added, "The might of a soldier will be gone with the military uniform he takes off."</p>
<p>When I returned to the backyard with peace of mind, an old man with a hunched back was standing under the steps of the south house, watering a pot of tender green bamboo with a mouthwash cup. One empty hand was still stroking the quietly unfolding clear green leaves. There really was a beard hanging down, but its color was gray.</p>
<p>In order to avenge my night of fright, I also coughed softly without warning. He raised his head in response and straightened his back. He was still a burly figure. Half a scar crawled out from under his small felt hat. His direct gaze revealed his sincerity.</p>
<p>I smiled, and he smiled back, his eyelids twitching slightly.</p>
<p>"Do you live in the south house?"</p>
<p>His voice was quite heavy and turbid, with a Shanxi accent: "Yes, did you move in yesterday? That's good. This yard is so quiet that even ghosts are about to dare to live here."</p>
<p>"I heard you coughing last night and thought a fox fairy had come."</p>
<p>He laughed heartily, stroking his silver-gray beard that resembled a rainy sky. Then he asked about my origin and school, sighing endlessly for those who were away from home. Because we were both wandering outside, we became familiar more quickly.</p>
<p>"I have a granddaughter as old as you!"</p>
<p>So, I had one more grandfather in name.</p>
<p>This old man loved to talk about trivial matters before and after his life, as well as his dead deeds. To him, these were as precious as his own life. They were indeed the deep scars of the life he had dragged through!</p>
<p>He often talked about the battles he had fought in the army. He was a small pawn of the warlord ××, but he wasn't that small. In the year after he took a bullet, he became a platoon leader and led troops.</p>
<p>"Look, a piece of meat was dug out of my leg, a piece of flesh was shaved off my shoulder, and the scar under my hat caused illness. It aches on cloudy days. Damn it, my ancestors didn't accumulate virtue by being soldiers!" He blinked his eyes, clenched his fist, and sighed. I often make fun of his habit of blinking.</p>
<p>"It was all熬出來守着通夜 or rolling around in the trenches. Sometimes, my eyes were so red that they were about to bleed, but I was still aiming my gun. How much worse is this life than yours studying? Your textbooks don't necessarily record the names of the brothers who risked their lives, do they?"</p>
<p>I told him that they did, but they were only the names of their marshals or generals. He smiled bitterly:</p>
<p>When he talked about his family members, the old man would tell people in a hoarse voice that his cousin was killed while standing on the side of his enemy, regretting:</p>
<p>"It's incomprehensible. Two brothers who used to catch crickets together in their hometown ended up fighting each other."</p>
<p>The old man lived his days on the small allowance his daughter sent him every month. His eyesight was failing, and his hands and feet would cramp from time to time. On sunny days, he would move a small stool and sit in the chaotic open space on the north side to bask in the sun, watching the light of the black cat's pupils crawl into the house to prepare his own meal on a small stove. Sometimes, when I came home from school, the old man would smile and offer me a pancake or half a cornbread. When I praised his good craftsmanship, he would be happy.</p>
<p>"I haven't eaten a meal cooked by my own wife in three years. By the time I retired, she had already entered the grave!"</p>
<p>Stroking my short hair, the old man would pout and talk about his granddaughter:</p>
<p>"She grows vegetables outside the city. She doesn't have her hair cut so short. Her braids are very long."</p>
<p>The other day, when the child came to send money to her grandfather, I happened not to be there. When I came back, the old man happily told me when his real granddaughter was coming to see me, the one with the hat mark.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would run to the old man's room to chat with him and drink a cup of light tea from his clay teapot. He was very happy to have the opportunity to chat about everything under the sun. Many times, he gently chided my habit of moving.</p>
<p>"Just stay here. Isn't it very pleasant?"</p>
<p>I also became docile:</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll stay here, old partner… no, Grandpa."</p>
<h3 id="e321">Silence <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Guanghan</p>
<p>Living as a modern person, most people know some of the benefits of silence, but few people can diligently practice it. The wise Israeli King Solomon (Solomon) said ten centuries ago, "The mouth of the wise is hidden in his heart, but the heart of the fool is hung on his mouth." This sentence is indeed worth pondering. Many people often see things that others find pleasing to the eye, but they simply can't stand, and as a result, they voluntarily break the commandment of "silence" and bring a lot of trouble. According to Solomon, they are just big fools. The wise hide their mouths in their hearts, so naturally there is nothing to say; everyone has nothing to say, and the atmosphere is peaceful, isn't that good? But some fools come out and want to hang their hearts on their mouths, chattering endlessly, saying a lot of discouraging words. Although the words have been said, and perhaps said very loudly, it is a pity that this world can only lose them forever.</p>
<p>Two thousand five hundred years ago, the great Greek philosopher Pythagoras taught the world: "Close your mouth, or say something more valuable than silence." The words of a bookworm seem reasonable at first glance, but on closer reflection, they can't help but feel foolish: to distinguish what words are valuable and what words are worthless is already a difficult problem at present. Do people really say words that have no value at all? I think, if they knew in the underworld, they would not agree. The Bible does not sing praises to those warriors who "take a city," but praises those wise men who can "rule their own spirit," and this is not without reason. There are many words in the world that, when spoken, make people "sincerely convinced," but they don't say them, preferring to leave them for the wise to say, and they prefer to say words that "seek suffering for themselves." No matter how many such tragic facts have occurred in history, people still do not know to be vigilant, and still prefer to endure torture for being talkative, and even sacrifice themselves. I am amazed at why there are so many "fools" in this world.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, I wake up from a dream and think of a few friends who gathered together day and night two or three years ago. Now some of them have passed away, and some are wandering in various places with unknown fates. I can't help but sigh repeatedly. St. Francis (St. Francis) said, "It is better to be silent than to speak the truth in an 'unhumorous' way, otherwise, it would be like pouring bad soy sauce on a good dish." Now, many clever people have learned to avoid the directness of truth and specialize in writing from the side, which can avoid suspicion and allow readers to relax, which is extremely clever. It's just a pity that some people can neither remain silent nor understand the way to add that dish of "soy sauce." What to do? What to do?</p>
<h3 id="e322">The Last Sadness (Part 2) <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Qing</p>
<p>Ah, I have been so tired and weak these days! I have traveled thousands of miles by water and stayed in countless strangers' homes. I have had sleepless nights of terror. I have also had days when countless needles seemed to be pricking my brain all day long. I have even had endless days of nonstop, hoarse work. Alas, don't these weak nerves and this tired body need some rest? It's time. Why not let me sleep quietly for a moment, even just for a moment.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, I took the opportunity to run to the French Park. Standing in the towering pavilion at the intersection of Avenue Dubail, I leaned on the railing and stood there in a daze for a long time. The leaves on the treetops of the not-so-sparse forest of French parasol trees in the park had almost fallen. Along the creek, there were a few poplars that could withstand the cold, with only slender, withered, and yellow willow branches remaining. When the cold wind blew, even people with tough hearts would be quietly moved! The water in the stream was fanned up with gentle ripples, passing all the way through the bridge. The lake was tightly locked with wrinkles, and it was even more difficult to resolve its sorrow. There were very few visitors in the morning. Ah! This park full of rustling sparse forests, this park full of flying fallen leaves, this park full of sorrowful waters, accompanied by the weeping of the flowing spring falling from the mountain peak, was enough to break one's heart. This scene suddenly reminded me of many old things at the Yellow Crane Tower and on the top of Snake Mountain. Ah, I am afraid to think deeply, and I am even more afraid to watch for a long time!</p>
<p>I shifted my gaze to the vague and hazy horizon. What immediately caught my eye were those deformed, round, and square buildings with more than ten or dozens of stories. Ah, I finally realized that I had drifted to the largest metropolis in East Asia. Ah, look: the sky is full of thick black lines, and the ground is full of madly running monsters of civilization. These high-voltage currents sending waves, these spherical axles, these thunderstorms made of metal. All these electric vehicles and gasoline vehicles are moving around and fighting. Ah, this is the manifestation of power, the manifestation of machinery, the manifestation of hard steel. Since I am in this tense and sharp environment, how can I allow myself to withdraw so weakly and stand aside to seek sorrow and express emotion? Ah, if I can't roll up my sleeves and angrily jump into this group of power struggles to learn to hone myself, then I'm afraid I won't be crushed into meat paste when a storm comes!</p>
<p>However, tonight, terrible sadness has once again crept into my heart! Ah, my body has felt an unstoppable cold, and my belly has felt an unbearable hunger. If I can't become a little harder, I tell you: I will roll up my sleeves and stride into the group of hard power struggles. Ah, you terrible sadness, you ugly sadness, please get out of here! With a somersault, get out of here forever!</p>
<p>Late November night, early morning of December in Shanghai.</p>

<p>— Written by Lawrence of England, translated by Tang Xiru</p>
<p>He was determined to sit up all night as a kind of penance. The telegram simply said: "Ophelia is critically ill." He thought that in this situation, it would be too inhumane to go to the sleeping car to sleep. So when the night covered France, he was still sitting wearily in the first-class carriage.</p>
<p>Of course, he should have been sitting by Ophelia's bedside long ago, but Ophelia didn't want him, so now he was sitting in the carriage.</p>
<p>In the depths of his heart, there was a black, heavy weight: like a poisonous tumor pregnant with absolute darkness, pulling his heart straight down. He had always taken life very seriously, and now seriousness overwhelmed him. His dark, handsome, clean-shaven face, and his deeply worried, slanted, thick black eyebrows could really be used to make a statue of Christ on the cross.</p>
<p>The night in the car was like a hell: nothing was real. The two old English women opposite him had already died. Perhaps they had died before he died, because, of course, he regarded himself as dead.</p>
<p>He felt the slow, gray light of dawn crawling up from the many mountains on the border. At the same time, his heart was repeatedly chanting: —</p>
<p>"When the dawn comes with the early morning rain,</p>
<p>Dark, melancholy, and cold.</p>
<p>Her peaceful eyelids closed:</p>
<p>She has another morning that is not ours."</p>
<p>His monk-like, unchanging face of suffering did not reveal even a trace of the contempt, and self-contempt, that his keen heart determined was present in this thought that was initially serious and then harmonious.</p>
<p>He was in Italy. He looked at this country with a faint disgust. When he saw the olive trees and the sea, he only felt a kind of disgust and could no longer feel anything else. It was all a poetic deception.</p>

<h3 id="e325">Relief from Melancholy or Relief from Oneself <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>The "disease of the times" for young people — melancholy — Mr. Bing published his new views in the 7th issue of this publication. Bing said that the source of most young people's melancholy is not due to "the disturbances of the world, the darkness of society, the fall of human relationships," because after they have been in society for some time, they feel that it doesn't matter. But melancholy still covers their hearts, so they need to seek answers from themselves. And Bing concluded by quoting Yuan Zhonglang's words as a reasonable method of remedy, saying that there must be a spiritual sustenance: "taking chess as a sustenance, taking sex as a sustenance, taking skill as a sustenance, taking writing as a sustenance."</p>
<p>There is a traditional Chinese thought that when the world is in turmoil, people want to seek a paradise. Tao Yuanming's "The fields are about to be overgrown, why not return?", Zhuge Liang's leisurely life in Wolonggang, all belong to this kind of "Everyone is drunk, I am the only one sober; everyone is turbid, I am the only one pure." Laughing at the wind and moon, drinking and composing poetry, is indeed an eternal anecdote and a name that will be remembered in the universe.</p>
<p>This trend has been passed down to the present and is still a kind of "national essence," so in the midst of shouts of killing, we have discovered things like "drinking bitter tea and planting sesame." But there are too many young people who are "busy all year round as if they have lost something," so people who are good at expressing their emotions have brought out Yuan Zhonglang to persuade people to express their emotions in chess, sex, skill, writing, etc., to prosper the world. It seems that these things can cure the disease of young people's melancholy, just like a "panacea," with unexpected effects. Bing's remarks about relieving young people's melancholy are based on this idea.</p>
<p>The ability of hypnosis to cure diseases lies in its ability to numb people's nerves: and the ability of expressing emotions in chess, sex, skill, and writing to relieve young people's melancholy lies in the spiritual sustenance, the two actually have the same effect. Monks, nuns, hermits, celebrities, and Yuan Zhonglang are all worthy of envy and praise, and the meaning is probably in this. However, Bing said that expressing emotions in chess, sex, skill, and writing can "live their lives happily, and achieve higher attainments," otherwise they will frown all day long and live a miserable life without tasting a bit of the sweetness of life, which is indeed beyond imagination.</p>
<p>However, I don't know if young people in general take this as a guide. After "expressing emotions" in chess, sex, skill, and writing to make their spirits have sustenance and relieve their melancholy, whether they still have to eat and live, and when suffering is still unavoidable, it will still make people "busy all day long as if they have lost something." If emotions can be expressed and life can be happy, and attainments can be high, it is really too good, too good: the melancholy of "worrying for no reason and not being happy in the face of beauty" is indeed "pitiable, pitiable," so in order to realize this idea, it is best to have not only a spiritual sustenance, but also a physical sustenance, that is, no longer having to eat and live, and relieving oneself.</p>

<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>From a pile of New Year's cards, I discovered a small violet note:</p>
<p>Old friend, I have no other New Year's greetings for you, I hope you will wait for me at the Grand Theater at nine o'clock tonight, you certainly know who is writing the letter.</p>
<p>This day last year, I also received a violet note like this, with only the four words "Happy New Year" on it. From my vague memory, it was certainly written by the same person, but I couldn't be sure if this letter writer was joking among friends, or some kind of mysterious event?</p>
<p>I was preoccupied with this thought, it seemed that all the friends I met today were suspicious, especially when they mentioned going to the Grand Theater to see a movie. I exhausted all kinds of methods to probe every suspect, but to no avail.</p>
<p>When evening came, I prepared to go to the Grand Theater to make a big joke.</p>
<p>Tonight, the audience was particularly crowded. In front of the ticket counter, groups of people were piled up, scrambling, as if the money in their hands couldn't be exchanged for a ticket. Although there were a few leisurely wandering in front of the door, I didn't run into any familiar faces.</p>
<p>Since I didn't necessarily want to see a movie, I was too lazy to compete in front of the ticket counter. Looking at the clock on the Hua'an Building from afar, it had just struck half past eight, so I stood nonchalantly in front of the door watching the people welcoming the New Year's arrival.</p>
<p>With my hands in my pockets, I stood like this for more than ten minutes, when someone patted me on the shoulder. Turning my head, it was an unfamiliar woman, but she opened her mouth to ask me:</p>
<p>"Do you know the person who asked you to wait?"</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"If you received my letter, you'd know who I am."</p>
<p>She smiled triumphantly. I then remembered that she was my middle school classmate, Luo Lan, who I had parted ways with nearly ten years ago.</p>
<p>"Still acting like a child." I shook her hand tightly, expressing a kind of enthusiasm beyond gratitude.</p>
<p>"This way, it's a bit more interesting."</p>
<p>Inside, she told me that she had already come in the afternoon to buy tickets. When she came just now, she walked past you, and seeing that you didn't seem to recognize me, I stood by the window watching your actions. Later, I determined it was you. If I hadn't greeted you, it would have been quite interesting.</p>
<p>Sitting in the dark movie theater, we mumbled about what had happened since we parted.</p>
<p>Here, I must mention that we had been in love in school, but I failed. So, when we talked about marriage, she asked me if I was married. I playfully replied:</p>
<p>"The women I loved all ran away!! What about you?"</p>
<p>"The men I loved all ran away!"</p>
<p>We laughed softly, as if pulled back to the happy days of being students ten years ago.</p>
<p>After the show ended, we were reluctant to separate immediately. We strolled slowly on the sidewalk. Although it was winter, the wind blowing in our faces didn't feel cold. I suddenly thought of last year's New Year's card and said to her:</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Who said it wasn't me who sent it?" she replied.</p>
<p>"How did you know what company I was at?"</p>
<p>"Have you flipped through our school's alumni directory?"</p>
<p>"Then, how did you think of this man who ran away?"</p>
<p>"It's nothing, I just thought of it occasionally."</p>
<p>We parted ways like this.</p>
<p>The next day, I found that violet note again:</p>
<p>Old friend, do you think this is really a coincidence? I hope you will muster the courage you had when you failed before. This time, victory is yours!</p>
<h3 id="e327">Widow <a href="#e327" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c327" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">327</a></h3>
<p>— Bo'er</p>
<p>Everyone in Xia Village knows that Sister-in-law Yi is a newlywed widow. Her beautiful face, her gentle demeanor, and her pleasing smile never fail to attract attention and praise. Everyone says: Yi's mother has good fortune to have taken such a beautiful daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>The sun shines on the peaceful village, and they all live carefree lives. But in recent years, it seems that everything has turned upside down. In addition, there is this war, the conscription of laborers. These things seem insignificant to the simple and brave young man, A Yi. He slowly and resolutely strides forward, and his shadow disappears from then on, never turning back to bid farewell to his wife of just over a month.</p>
<p>One day, two days, one month, two months, they still do not wait for A Yi to return.</p>
<p>At dusk, she quietly walks out of the city gate, stands on the bank of the De River, gazing at the distant, swaying boats approaching. She thinks: "Maybe that's him?" But the small boat passes her by without a second thought. Sister-in-law Yi's heart gradually darkens, because her disappointment has been accumulating for years, not just today. Every morning when she wakes up, she still remembers her husband's odd habits: having breakfast before brushing his teeth, putting on his hat before putting on his clothes. Now, everything is empty and quiet. That pleasing smile will no longer appear on her face. Occasionally, she tries to please her mother-in-law, and she forces a smile, but it provokes Yi's mother's resentment and curses: "What a jinx! A flesh-eating monster! What a waste of your extraordinary appearance..." Sister-in-law Yi has grown accustomed to hearing these things.</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Yi, with her wounded and haggard appearance, supporting her worried expression, carries a small bamboo basket. Following the rising sun, she goes to the morning market, buys the small crucian carp that her mother-in-law wants to eat, and some other vegetables. For months, it has become her habit. She carries the vegetable basket back before Yi's mother gets up.</p>
<p>Yi's mother says: "Why do you always buy this small crucian carp? Does the fish seller have a connection with you? Hmm..."</p>
<p>"If mother-in-law doesn't want to eat this, I'll buy something else tomorrow," Sister-in-law Yi answers cautiously and respectfully.</p>
<p>At this time, Little Pig runs in and says:</p>
<p>"Yi's mother! Yi's mother! Uncle Xia San from the market just passed by here. He asked if you were home. And who else is at home? I told him that you are often home, and then he ran away without saying anything."</p>
<p>Little Pig is an ignorant child who lives next door to Yi's mother. He likes to bring outside news to Yi's mother the most. This time, he told her what Xia San said, just as he usually does. Little did he know that Yi's mother had already cast her fierce gaze upon Sister-in-law Yi, holding her breath, standing up, heavily knocking on the table, and shouting loudly: "Good! You... shameless thing, he's coming to find you, go! Flesh-eating ancestor demon, don't you dare ruin my family's reputation! Get out of here!"</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Yi was about to speak up and explain, but her mother-in-law immediately shouted loudly! "What are you trying to argue?"</p>
<p>She didn't make a sound until the next morning. Yi's mother still didn't hear any sound from her daughter-in-law. She suspected that she was trying to upset her, but the truth told her that Sister-in-law Yi's body was already in the well.</p>

<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>The faint sun shines diagonally on the hillside. Old Grandpa A Qi sits on a green stone in front of the door, smoking his pipe with one puff and then none. He squints his old, blurred eyes, as if deep in thought. Two yellow bean-sized clear snot droplets hang on his few gray whiskers.</p>
<p>"Ping! Pang!" A group of children are setting off small firecrackers in the open space, wearing bright red and green new clothes, laughing and jumping happily. The surrounding air is filled with joy. His grandson, Yu'er, is also in the group, but he is not wearing new clothes. He is still wearing the same dirty, tattered padded jacket that he wears every day.</p>
<p>Ah! New Year's was such a happy time in childhood! But when one reaches middle age, especially old age, festivals or New Year's not only become bland, but sometimes evoke feelings of sadness and tears!</p>
<p>As he thinks, looking at this group of happy little angels, he can't help but think of his own childhood, and his son A Jin's childhood. In his own childhood, it was when his father was prominent in the village, so he had plenty of food and clothing, and lived without worries. The family hired two farmhands and a nanny. His father would hold a pipe and walk out the door with a small braid, and people would always call him "Second Master." When his son A Jin was a child, things were not as good as in the past! The family did not have to worry about food and clothing, but in the end, if you didn't work, you wouldn't eat. Unlike his father, when the rice was eaten, people would send rent rice, and when money was needed, people would bring it to the door. Now, things are even worse. Natural disasters and man-made calamities have struck one after another, and exorbitant taxes have been constantly increasing. Rural bankruptcy has reached its peak. The harvest of the year, including barley and corn, is not even enough to last until the next harvest. Not long after the flood, banditry and locust plagues broke out. Last year, there was even a drought. We poor people have no way to survive!</p>
<p>Even as he thinks like this, the fire in his pipe has gone out, but he still keeps desperately puffing away, making the pipe squeak...</p>
<p>Ai! I've lived for seventy or eighty years, and it's the first time I've encountered such a year. How can we get through such days? I've lived enough. Living longer would only waste food, but A Jin's days are really hard! The harvest is so scarce, but the burden is heavier every day. Other families play and have fun on the first day of the Lunar New Year, but he still went to the radish field last night to dig a load of radishes, and this morning he took them out to sell again. But now radishes are not worth much. In previous years, we could get more than a dozen silver dollars from this radish field, but now we can only sell them for five cents a pound. A load of radishes can't even be exchanged for one and a half liters of rice. How can our family of five survive!</p>
<p>As Old Grandpa A Qi was lamenting to himself, Mr. Wu came back from the teahouse in town, excited after drinking Yuanbao tea. Passing by here, he saw Old Grandpa A Qi sitting there alone, so he made a bow to him.</p>
<p>"Congratulations on getting rich! Grandpa A Qi, why don't you go to the tea house and sit at home alone on the first day of the Lunar New Year? Aren't you lonely?"</p>
<p>"Get rich! You get rich too! You came back from town early?" Old Grandpa A Qi reluctantly bowed slightly.</p>
<p>"The town is very quiet this year, it doesn't feel like the New Year at all. I wasn't interested in sitting there, and the gambling den didn't attract anyone either, so I went back to sleep."</p>
<p>"Ah! In such a year, we can't even fill our stomachs, so how can we have the mood to celebrate the New Year?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know! I heard that Chengtai, Xiangsheng, and several other stores have closed down, and I'm afraid some others won't be able to open!" Mr. Wu said as he walked away.</p>
<p>"If no one buys anything, the stores will naturally have a hard time opening!" Old Grandpa A Qi watched Mr. Wu's back disappear into the woods with a pair of melancholy eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e329">The Man Who Bears the Cross <a href="#e329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>— Green Silk</p>
<p>During the day, rubbing his sleepy eyes, he bids farewell to the darkness. As the morning rooster crows for the first time, and the stars have just disappeared into the blue sky, people of all classes stretch their lazy bodies.</p>
<p>The sky is a terrifying azure, like a blue snakeskin stretched across the sky.</p>
<p>The scene of early winter is indescribably desolate!</p>
<p>Every day, early in the morning, whipped by life, he jumps awake from a sweet dream, rubs his eyes, washes his face, puts on his clumsy clothes, and hurriedly slips out of the triangular little house that resembles the multi-lined homes of artists from ancient Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>Continuing, continuing to be loaded into the workplace, thirty li outside the city, and being driven back every day at twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>In the long-term, unceasing work, he bears the heavy cross according to his original will.</p>
<p>He never utters a sound of "tiredness," nor of "complaint," quietly following the turning of the great wheel of time, with the same inner and outer peace.</p>
<p>A beautiful soul, a noble and attractive figure, as if that kind of life has subdued him, even though he himself has never uttered a word of "disobedience."</p>
<p>The greatness lies in his calm and thoughtful manner, which is a rare type of person among those I have seen.</p>
<p>(Life is a symphony of joy and pain, and the ability to remain calm under great stimulation is what makes a person successful!)</p>
<p>Many times, when I felt empty and succumbed to negativity over trivial matters, he would always encourage me with those words!</p>
<p>(Women have no careers. How many great women have you seen, past and present, domestic and foreign?)</p>
<p>He sighs deeply, filled with infinite sadness.</p>
<p>(But, the morning rooster is singing, and the sun is rising from the east, and that is the light of hope!)</p>
<p>Words of warmth slip out from his curved lips, one by one.</p>
<p>(You understand me, but you have no way to fulfill my wish. Therefore, my emptiness dominates my entire life.)</p>
<p>Another pair of tears of gratitude rolls down her cheeks. She looks once more at the calm face of the man who bravely bears the cross, and her heart is filled with a deeper sense of indescribable shame and anxiety.</p>

<p>Lushan Ballad Sent to Imperial Censor Lu Chuzhou Li Bai</p>
<p>I am originally a madman of Chu, singing madly and laughing at Confucius.</p>
<p>Holding a green jade staff, I bid farewell to the Yellow Crane Tower in the morning.</p>
<p>I don't mind going far to find immortals in the Five Mountains, and I love to travel in famous mountains all my life.</p>
<p>Mount Lu stands out from the Southern Dipper monk, and the nine layers of screens are covered with clouds and brocade.</p>
<p>The shadow falls on Ming Lake with azure light; Jin Guan opens two peaks long in front;</p>
<p>The Silver River hangs upside down on the Three Stone Bridges; Incense Burner Waterfall can be seen from afar.</p>
<p>The returning cliffs and stacked peaks are soaring. Emerald shadows and red clouds reflect the rising sun,</p>
<p>Birds cannot fly to the long sky of Wu. Climbing high, I have a magnificent view of the world,</p>
<p>The Yangtze River goes away and never returns. Yellow clouds move the wind in thousands of miles,</p>
<p>White waves flow over the snow mountains in nine streams.</p>
<p>It is good to write a Lushan ballad, and it is caused by Lushan.</p>
<p>Leisurely peeking at the stone mirror, I clean my heart; After Xie Gong's footprints, there is green moss.</p>
<p>I have taken Huandan early without worldly feelings, and my Qin heart has been completed three times.</p>
<p>I see immortals in green clouds from afar, holding lotuses in my hands and facing the Jade Capital.</p>
<p>I will travel to the Nine Realms ahead of time, and I wish to fast with Lu Ao and swim in the Great Qing.</p>

<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(4) The Origin of the "Star System"</p>
<p>At that time, when we talked about "stars," we only knew they were bright, shining things in the sky at night. How could those small-time capitalists who risked everything to invest in a five-cent movie theater imagine that those glittering things in the sky would sing, dance, walk, and eat on the ground? Indeed, at that time, there were already famous actors and actresses on the stage. Gentlemen and ladies wore formal attire, black overcoats, and tall hats, paying a high price to see Maude Adams, Mrs. Fiske, Edward Sothern, and others. How could they have imagined that these wealthy people would soon flock to small alleys, spending five cents to watch flickering shadows on a screen?</p>
<p>At that time, the "moving people" in movies were insignificant. They were not even as valuable as the projectors in small movie theaters. The producers at that time – in fact, they didn't even deserve the title of producer – would just grab anyone and put them in front of the camera, telling them to do this or that. They never imagined that these people would one day be more valuable than the cameras themselves. There was a woman named Gladys Smith who, after her husband died in Canada, was so poor that she had no food to eat. She took her three children to perform in plays to earn a living. Because performing in plays wasn't enough to support the family, the eldest daughter, named Gladys, went to a film company (Biograph Studio) in New York, hoping to earn a little more money to support her family. At that time, she used the name Mary Pickford. Little did she know that she would later become world-famous, known to every man, woman, and child!</p>
<p>At that time, film companies could not hire famous stage actors. The big names on the stage called this new invention "canned theater," and they despised and looked down on it. They considered working on a film set a dishonorable thing. A stage actor would never stoop to that kind of work unless he was desperate for money. Even if he had no choice but to make a movie, he would do it secretly, keeping it a secret from his friends, afraid of being looked down upon. However, later, these people who moved on the screen were discovered by the audience, and their status gradually became important. So, in essence, stars, whether it was Garbo, Crawford, Hepburn, or Mae West, were all created by the audience.</p>
<p>When moving pictures were first invented, everyone was amazed just to see things moving. But later, the audience couldn't just be satisfied with seeing shadows move. They wanted to see something more interesting than just movement. What they discovered was not the camera angles or the filming techniques, etc. What they discovered were the characters in the movies. At first, you didn't know who any of the actors were. Later, you gradually began to inquire who that girl with the long, curly hair (Mary Pickford) was. More and more people inquired, and finally, the producers realized that the names of the characters in the movies were also important. This was the beginning of the "Star System" (Star System).</p>
<p>But stubborn producers, even after they realized the importance of the characters, still insisted for many years on trying to get rid of that system. They said that the director's position was much more important than the actors'. They wanted to promote the director's name. Of course, the directors' contributions to the success of a film are undeniable, but somehow, the audience insisted on knowing the actors' names and placed the director's name in the optional category. The producers also wanted to promote the films themselves. They spent huge sums of money to purchase literary masterpieces and stage successes, and they hired famous writers to write the scripts. But no matter what, you, the audience, still demanded every day to know the names of every important actor. The producers couldn't resist you. They were conquered by you. By 1910, the star system was at its peak. Each and every great actor was called a "star" (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e336">Review of "Here Comes the Navy" <a href="#e336" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c336" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">336</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Here Comes the Navy</p>
<p>丨 Grand Theater</p>
<p>Judging from the translated title "Here Comes the Navy," some people might think that this is a demonstration of maritime hegemony, a work about fierce sea battles and "killing until the ghosts cry and the gods wail." But this is just a mediocre story of a sailor's romance, a coincidence, and a chance.</p>
<p>While repairing the USS Arizona in the shipyard, worker Gus has a quarrel with Petty Officer Biff of the same ship. He also loses his lover in a dancing competition duel over a woman.</p>
<p>In order to fight for so-called "heroic spirit" in front of the woman and his rival, he joins the Navy recruitment team for military training, and as a result, he is assigned as a sailor under his rival.</p>
<p>The play unfolds from the point that Gus accidentally meets a girl, Rosanne, who happens to be Biff's sister. This leads to many love disputes. In the midst of Gus's aversion to the depressing mood of the Navy life, a shooting exercise occurs, and the so-called dramatic crisis of an explosion in the turret arises. Then, Gus somehow puts out the fire with his body. The play shifts to balloons through scenes of injury, awards, and job changes.</p>
<p>As the balloon descends, sailors from the USS Arizona rush to help. A sudden storm forms the climax of the play, ending with Gus risking his life to save Biff, fulfilling his long-cherished wish to marry Rosanne.</p>
<p>Here, the inadequacy of the screenwriter's technique is visible everywhere. For example, the fact that Gus happens to be assigned under Biff and that Rosanne happens to be Biff's sister are all assumed to be coincidences that the author painstakingly manages for the development of the play. The ending, with the sudden storm and Gus saving Biff, plus the fact that the fire in the powder magazine can be extinguished with the body, and the fact that the balloon completely loses its lifting and lowering function in the wind, all use illogical scenes as the key.</p>
<p>The producer's intention in making this film is probably to insert sailors' erotic lives, such as dancing and dueling for women, into the great warships, strict military discipline, and thrilling balloons, just to give the audience a change of pace.</p>
<p>Director Lloyd Bacon is quite commendable for being able to turn this script into the success it is on screen. He compensates for many of the screenwriter's shortcomings with a relaxed tone, bright shots, and witty dialogue. The performance of ninety days of military training and the depiction of sailors' erotic lives, wiping cannons, flying balls, duels, weddings, and other scenes are quite beautiful and lovely.</p>
<p>The camera angles and positions are also very appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e337">Review of "Death on the Diamond" <a href="#e337" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c337" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">337</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Death on the Diamond</p>
<p>丨 Nanjing</p>
<p>Naturally, the audience needs stimulation, so American screenwriters are doing their best to find subjects in this area, and this is not without reason. But how do their screenwriters choose stimulating subjects? In the past, we have seen many works with horse racing, boxing, and boat racing as backgrounds, and now there is this "Death on the Diamond," which combines murder mystery and baseball.</p>
<p>In terms of artistic evaluation, "Death on the Diamond" can be said to have nothing valuable to offer except for the so-called suspenseful scenes.</p>
<p>In terms of the structure of the story, it cannot be said that it does not have relatively rigorous techniques. That is to say, the development of the story is relatively natural and compact. For example, the several murders of players create a rather tense atmosphere, which cannot but be determined by the script. But this is nothing more than a display of technique. The exaggeration of technique without content or principle cannot give the audience a deeper impression after all.</p>
<p>What does "Death on the Diamond" tell us? A baseball team, because it is used as a tool for gamblers to gamble, the players are killed one after another, and the murderer is an old man who has been with the captain for many years. He is tempted by money and is executed by law. In terms of theme, it seems to be against baseball being used as a tool for gambling, and it also carries a bit of human relationships. However, regarding the former, baseball, like horse racing and jai alai, has the same function, which is an inevitable phenomenon of capitalism. The latter is also determined by the private economic system, but the author does not explain it from this point of view. On the whole, it is an ordinary work after all.</p>

<p>— Huo</p>
<p>...For thousands of years, Chinese women, under the heavy pressure of feudalism, have not been liberated and have been imprisoned in dark families all day long, living miserable lives under the iron hooves of their parents-in-law. Hu Die in "Orphan of the Valley" is a woman living in such a family, suffering misfortune. When she moves and acts on her wedding night, she is laughed at by those elders of noble families, which leads to various tragedies. This is an ethical and family problem film.</p>
<p>...Yan Yuexian has always played villains in films, and this time in "Orphan of the Valley" is no exception. When she dotes on her own son and abuses the children of her husband's ex-wife, that sinister expression is played vividly. The sin of this stepmother moves Hu Die to tears, which is of course one of the successful shots in "Orphan of the Valley."</p>
<p>...Japanese imperialism destroys our mountains and rivers. Gao Zhanfei and Zhao Dan are both members of the volunteer army. When Zhao Dan dies in battle, Gao Zhanfei cries bitterly while caressing the body. His tears really fall down. According to Lao Gao, this shot is a scene from the battlefield when he was a soldier a few years ago. No wonder Lao Gao is so sad. (True)</p>

<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Since Dan Oliver escaped, he has not been captured for a long time. Although the police have sent out detectives, they have not found any clues and have no way to arrest him. One morning, Joan was reading the newspaper at home when she suddenly heard someone walking outside the door. She looked up and saw that the person coming in was the ragged, haggard woman she had seen in court before. She saw Joan and asked, "Are you Joan Mitchell? I am Dan Oliver's woman, Mary Mallory. I've come... to tell you that Oliver didn't mean to hit Captain Camden. He really had no way out and was desperate. I also want to tell you that Oliver is not as bad as the Express says he is. He is just a little weak-willed. But since the Express announced his affairs, he has had no way to start over." Mary then told Joan all the things that had happened before, how she had helped him fight and waited for him to pay off his debts. Finally, Joan found out that Mary was penniless and had no place to live. Joan admired her for being so loyal to Oliver, so she told Mary that she would find her a place to live first. Mary refused at first, but Joan insisted on helping her.</p>
<p>After Mary left, Joan went out to find a house for Mary. She also asked Axel to help her. Later, they found a very suitable house. They paid the rent, told the landlady that they were renting it for a friend, and asked the landlady for the key. They wrote down the address and sent someone to Mary's old place. But the landlady didn't believe what Joan said, that it was rented for a friend. Joan was also busy buying a lot of food and supplies for Mary, piling them up in the house, and she was busy until dusk before she finished. Axel was already impatient and kept urging Joan to go back. Unexpectedly, just as they were about to leave the place, someone suddenly knocked on the door. Joan opened the door and saw that it was not Mary standing at the door, but Dan Oliver. Oliver first ran to Mary's old place to find her. Mary told him how righteous Mitchell's daughter was, willing to help her, and had already found a house and sent the key to her. Oliver listened and became suspicious, so he came to see what was going on. When he saw Joan, he asked her head-on, "What tricks are you playing? I'm telling you! Don't try to harm Mary Oliver!" Joan said, "We just want to help her. And I've already promised her that I'll talk to my father tonight." Oliver gnashed his teeth and said, "Oh, that's right. You're all the same. Tonight, you'll talk to your father, and then you'll send someone to catch Mary, right? I'll tell you, you can't escape!" As he said this, he stretched out his fist and knocked Joan to the ground with one punch. Axel immediately jumped up, but Oliver had already pulled out his gun and aimed it at Axel's chest. With a clang, Axel fell to the ground and died. Oliver laughed crazily, stuffed the gun into the hands of the unconscious Joan lying on the ground, and ran away.</p>
<p>It wasn't until dawn the next day that Joan woke up slowly. But when she saw the situation around her, she almost fainted again. She was holding a gun in her hand, and Axel was dead beside her. Her head was aching, but she struggled to run to the phone and made a call to Tyler Camden. A moment later, Camden arrived in a police car. When Joan saw him, she leaned on his shoulder and told him what she could remember, intermittently, and Camden said. She only remembered that Oliver suddenly walked in, threatened her, and then she woke up and Axel was dead beside her. After she finished speaking, she asked Camden to send her home. But Camden's face was ashen as he said, "Joan! I can't send you home. Under the law, and according to all the evidence, I have to detain you. You are suspected of murder." (To be continued)</p>
