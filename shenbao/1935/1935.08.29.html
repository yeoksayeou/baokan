<h3>新滿鐵總裁松岡赴任</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>日本新任南滿鐡道會社總裁松岡洋右日前由東京出發。赴瀋履任。臨行發表其所懷抱之革新計劃。謂當前滿鐵之主要工作。（一）爲敷設由津浦綫滄州站至平漢綫張家口站之滄石鐵路造成日本在華北之經濟路綫。促進日本大陸政策之成功（二）爲積極進行南滿鐵道會社之改組。使達到機能之統一化與强大化。同時並擴張現有之經濟調査會及東亞課。以便從事華北富源之調査。二者於我國家前途關係至巨。願就滿鐵之性質。及其總裁易人之意義。略抒所見。爲國人吿。</p>
<p>（一）南滿鐵道會社之成立。爲日本經營滿洲之開端。亦其大陸政策實施之初步。此項組織。其性質與英國最初經營印度時之東印度公司殆無異致而其經營鐵道·港灣·炭坑製鐵·電氣等事業之努力則猶過之。吾東北之有今日不幸的局面。不可謂非受滿鐵之賜也。</p>
<p>（二）自去年以來。滿鐵會社爲適應新形勢之需要。早有進行改組之醞釀。日本國內三位一體與一位一體之爭諭一時頗烈。結果關東軍獲得最後之勝利。所謂駐滿全權大使。旣由關東軍司令官兼任。滿鐡總裁一席。自亦以關東軍之親信人物爲得宜。新任松岡總裁。與軍部淵源頗深。曾任滿鐵副總裁及理事有年。才智縱橫。手腕靈敏。在外交坫壇。亦素著聲譽。最近進行中之滿蒙鐡道計劃。卽彼所草擬者。今松岡奉命膺斯重任。必將舒展其夙昔之懷抱。將來滿鐵之發展。實大可注意。</p>
<p>（三）目前日本對華政策之重心在華北。而今後滿鐡工作之主要目標亦在華北松岡赴任以後。關東軍與滿鐡合作更趨密切。其對華北進出之積極。自亦意料中事。據東報所傳。日方以滿鐡爲中心之開發華北原則。業已確立。其具體方案爲。（一）在天津方面網羅各方面之權威者。設置中日「滿」之一大調査機關。担負華北經濟開發之參謀本部任務。並使之成爲指導機關。（二）日本資本之進出。主要者皆由滿鐵負扭。根據經濟參謀本部之指導而實行。現滿鐵方面。巳决定在本年之內。計劃發行一億二千萬元之公司債。以充新鐵路之建築費。此項計畫。雖一方面因日本資本家對滿鐵投資。以超出純粹經濟利益範圍。無穩固之保障。頗存觀望。另一方面。則因松岡與財界及金融界之關係素淺。募集資金。亦匪易易但此計畫果一旦實現。則日本在華北之經濟勢力。必更不可動搖矣。</p>
<p>基於上述。吾人可知此次松岡之就任滿鐡總裁。其意義實有不容忽視者在。語云。「前事不忘。後事之師。」國人觀於滿鐵以往之歷史。及日後發展之計畫。其亦有所警惕乎。</p>

<h3>美國會之成績　通過法案內政外交均關重要　明年總統競選羅斯福仍有望</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國國會第七十四屆會期、已於員夜閉會、本屆國會會期、開會時日最爲久長、則以羅斯福總統必欲將其關於「新政」之各項主要法案、在國會逐項表决通過故也、査國會本屆會期中所通過之各項法案、無論就內政外交而言、關均係屬重要、</p>
<p>關於外交　就外交而言、美國加入海牙常設國際法院之一案、雖爲羅斯福總統所贊助、然參院則竟於本年二月間投票加以否决、參院之用意、蓋在申明美國不過問歐洲政治之堅决志願、若干參議員則甚至欲通過法律案、以確立美國在戰時之中立態度、嗣後因羅斯福總統寗願將中立問題暫懸不决、故未克通過、僅通過一修正案、主張美國禁運軍火至交戰國、其効力至明年二月底爲止、此外國會又通過所謂波浦麥克雷諾爾茲法案」、規定設立聯邦管理局、以管轄軍火之販賈及製造、並核准一九二五年所簽訂日內瓦國際軍火貿易公約、此爲國會對外政策法案之犖犖大者、</p>
<p>關於內政　至就內政而言、則國會本屆期中之工作可分爲兩個時期、國會開幕後之最初五個月爲第一時期、在此時期中、曾將去夏羅斯福演說中所歷舉之政綱製成法律、其目的則在救濟經濟恐慌、改良社會狀况、其中最重要之法案、則如撥欵四十八萬萬美元設立救濟失業及工賑基金也、將財政善後銀公司法律延長兩年也、創設社會保險制度之社會安全法案也、鞏固工會權利之華格納法案也、不意在此時期中、最高法院竟判決復興法規違背憲法、因此自羅斯福總統秉政以來所通過之各項法案是否有效、乃悉成問題、自此時起至國會閉幕時止乃為第二時期、至此羅斯福總統不得不遵照最高法院判決、修改復興法規、延長其有效時期十個月、嗣後國會復通過各項法案、均具國家主義傾向、而以統制經濟貨幣為其目的、如銀行法也·擴大農業調整局法律也、取締私家公司操縱公用事業之維勒　案也·規定煤業業規之格斐法案也、迨後　統於七月初向國會送出咨文、要求通過稅收法案，對於有鉅額入欵之殷富徵收特別稅、一般人以爲總統此項咨文、實爲對付參議員灰朗之一種手段、蓋灰朗侈言均富政策、欲藉是以蠱惑人心、俾於明年出任候選總統、故羅斯福特主張抽收殷富稅　以爲釜底抽薪之計云、抑以上各項法案、其性質均屬急進、自不免遭企業資本家之猛烈反對、風潮激盪致令國會特設調査委員會、調査私家公司出資運動國會議員反對政府法案之情形、馴至舊時弊竇悉行揭發、</p>
<p>總上觀之、則本屆國會期中、羅斯福總統可謂逞心愜意、明年十一月美國選舉下任總統時、羅斯福挾此大宗法案、對於選民自不患無辭矣、至就憲法觀點而論、則國會本屆會期內、中央政府權力大見增加、而各州自治權則見削减、此又可注目之一現象也、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）公正之觀察者今日表示、銀派議員於下屆會中所遇最大之阻礙、將爲衆院多數派領袖之反對、因彼等大槪以政府之意旨爲依違、惟參院中之白銀派則因有農業派之贊助、大槪於下屆國會中將更有力、故一般人對於銀農兩派聯合推進幣制行動之可能、目前頗多懸測、倘兩派果能聯合、則其成功與否、當視衆院銀派能否戰勝議會程序中之障礙爲轉移、本屆國會閉幕之時、尙有關於白銀之計劃未曾了結者、如下列數端、（一）麥卡倫之取消白銀利益稅案、參院雖巳通過、衆院尙爲懸案、（二）湯默斯之提案卽要求財部積極購銀、俟銀價升至每盎斯一元二角九分之後、然後自由購售、以穗定銀價、（三）畢德門調査政府購銀政策對於物價及國際貿易之影響、（四）農業委員會所推舉之小委員會、由湯默斯等調査財部實施購銀計劃情形、湯氏今日曾向美聯社稱、彼之調査將着手詢問駐在華盛頓之各國外交代表、以集合世界專家對於幣制問題之意見、並將徵求各國專家對於金本位複本位及統制貨幣之答案、此外如銀行家經濟學家及各國幣制專家、亦將直接向之徵詢意見、俾可取得國內外各方面之助力云、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<p>銅北被災情形</p>
<p>黃水入銅之前、銅北人民、忙於築隄防水、田地人力之犧牲、巳不在少、水至以後、蘭家霸以北之村落、完全淹沒、西隄潰決之際、搶堵民夫、均被水隔斷、彼此不能相顧、督工人員紛以民船營救出險、材料損失亦多、水勢泛濫、冲襲二道防綫、則村落全成澤國、銅縣長王公　自開始築隄　時、卽在隄次督工、現以各堤築竣、始行返城、據王氏在災區目睹計算、二區之安民·悅來·兩鄕、三區之八段·睢趙·王樓·永義·馬溝·單樓·沙樓·雙樓·八鄕、五區之垞城·三山·仁里·三鄕、六區之永興·荊橋·嘉和·屯河·安華·五鄕、九區之蘆山·醒河·汴塘·三鄕、共二十一鄕、每鄕以萬人計之、應有災民二十萬左右、至被水之慘狀、則或升屋頂、或蹲樹梢、鵠面鳩表、嗷嗷待哺、防黃固是問題、救濟亦未容緩、</p>

<h3>川河航業突有起色　中外航商競爭熱　日輪恢復重慶班</h3>
<p>川河航業、蕭條不振已歷多年、致捷江公司、因營業虧耗而停閉、近自匯水平準以後、此路營業、乃突然起色、日輪亦復航、去貨大擁、亟將近情、分述如下、</p>
<p>去貨暢擁</p>
<p>川河航輪、自七公司同盟解散後、因匯水高漲、川帮均停止辦貨、營業乃一落千丈、各輪公司除將水脚狂跌爭運去貨外、一籌莫展、由是坐受損失、美商捷汀公司、且在此潮流中停閉、乃自中央軍入川剿匪大勝、中央銀行分設川行、穩定川中金融以來、匯價大落、市面好轉、川民旣得安居樂業川帮辦貨相率趕迅入渝去貨驟形擁擠、航業驟形起色、數月來　化之速、有非人意料所及、</p>
<p>航運復興</p>
<p>川河航業復興原因、係川中金融平定、人民購買力恢復、滬上川帮、紛運大批棉紗洋雜貨等赴渝、現在航行川河商輪、在捷江收閉、招商於棄以來、民生公司已一躍而居首位、次爲太古怡和等洋商輪邇內上水貨運求過於供、民生公司赴渝班輪、不敷裝載、茲已增加班次、一面又通吿各報關行凡運渝　、必須於兩星期以前預定、否則不及裝船民生如是太古怡和亦如是、</p>
<p>水脚飛增</p>
<p>川可水脚在解散同盟後、各公司互相跌價、低落到極度、後乃漸次增加、每噸上水貨運價、漲至廿四元、近月來入川貨之突飛猛進接踵擁裝、各輪公司、已乘機將裝赴重慶去貨運率、提高增漲、每噸水脚至少爲二十四元者、刻已加增至四十四元、按照原訂之價幾漲起百分之八十以上、尙有繼續漲價之可能、</p>
<p>新輪急開</p>
<p>太古公司向捷江購買三江輪第一艘宜平號、已經改造成功、更名萬流號、今日上水開渝、前日船方訂定行期、各客家卽到太古公司競欲爭裝去貨、公司當局無法應付、當時曾移拋河筒、槪行拒却、因貨多船少、難於支配也昨已滿船、而未能裝運之貨、竟超過所裝一倍以上、可　發達之一斑、第二船亦將改造竣工、昨據楊經理對記老言、船名已改定曰康定、不久卽可開班、以應客家之需求云、</p>
<p>日船開班</p>
<p>日淸公司川河輪、原有雲陽丸·官陽丸·德陽丸·等數艘行駛、一二八後、停班不開、至今已歷數載、該社長江與湖南綫均早復航唯川河綫迄未恢復今因日貨又有銷路滬上運川貨、又需要船裝、該社乘此磯會、急將最　雲陽丸修理出廠、並召集船員水手人等、准自九月分起、恢復重慶航綫、一俟貨擠、再行增加一船、此船開駛後、長江上下游日輪之航路全復矣、</p>
<p>三北發展</p>
<p>三北公司為我民航中最具勢力者、在川河內、已有富華·富陽·兩船行駛、今决將川河輪擴張、已在進行購買某輪、專供行駛重慶一路、談判將竣、卽可成功、</p>

<h3>邱仁高醫生　被堂侄等訴追五萬元　案情複雜尤涉及男女之事　卽原吿陳述時亦期期艾艾</h3>
<p>設診所於南京路拋球場集成藥房之西醫邱仁高、現年四十有二、家住滬西愚園路愚谷邨七十六號、原籍爲浙之上虞、其祖當紅羊之亂、避難奔申、遂僑居焉、有傳其祖本王姓者、亦有謂氏謝者、而仁高之姓邱、則因其父作邱氏之贅婿故、是以其堂兄慶元、仍姓謝、慶元生三子、長錫恩、次惠恩、幼巧恩、又生三女、曰恩美·恩娟·恩新、皆正室所出、</p>
<p>後賦悼亡</p>
<p>乃續弦某氏女爲繼室、因得慶元寵、則產悉歸掌握、子女胥莫能染指、仁高與該婦分屬叔嫂、但絕不避瓜李之嫌、親暱逾恒、迨慶元物化、仁高竟與婦同居、錫恩及諸弟妹雖不齒繼母與叔之行爲、惟念中籌之言、不可道也、咸自諱之、及去夏覺父死母病、一切財產、僅母與叔知、深慮繼母若不測、或有</p>
<p>化為烏有</p>
<p>之虞、故就母病榻向叔詰問、旋經仁高書一保管財產五萬元之字據給之、載明該欵分五年攤還、未幾錫恩之繼母逝世、錫恩乃持據向仁高索取該欵、交涉至今、分文不得、錫恩始與諸弟妹同延律師向第一特區地方法院對邱仁高提起追償五萬元遺產之訴、昨晨、由第一特院莫潤華推事開庭傳審、</p>
<p>原吿六人</p>
<p>祇到謝錫恩·惠恩·巧恩·昆仲三名、其餘三女子、皆未成年、亦未投案、而到庭之三原吿、則推錫恩發言、莫推事當命陳述起訴事實、乃彼因是案內容、多係其叔仁高與已死之繼母曖昧行動、若於法庭　上據實揭發、實屬攸關雙方顏面、如猶秘而不宣、則案情難期大白、以此多方顧慮、致</p>
<p>期期艾艾</p>
<p>益令庭上不能明瞭、而其代理律師遂起而代爲陳述、惟略去涉及男女之私者而不言、祇謂茲所訴追者、係根據被吿親書之字據、緣去年六月間、原吿之繼母病臥大華醫院、自知不起、召原吿等子女六人、至病榻泣而囑曰、若父所積、悉在四叔（即被吿）處、時被吿亦在塲、渠聞原吿繼母言、殊不悅、即對其母云、汝</p>
<p>靜心調治</p>
<p>勿戀戀於此事、原吿等本知其母與被吿之關係、當向被告詢問、被吿始邀錫恩赴其家、給以五萬元之字據、錫恩以其父遺產十餘萬、何祗於據內書五萬金、詰之被吿、則承認餘資巳被其耗費、立據後數日、原吿母死、向被吿索欽、被其一再遊約、詎至本年六月、忽以該據係脅迫書寫、</p>
<p>希圖狡賴</p>
<p>故原吿祗得起訴云云、庭上隨傳被吿邱仁高至案、將據給閱、並訊以經過事實、邱態度圓滑、答詞模稜、謂此據是否爲伊原寫者、不能認定、而伊原寫之據、亦係謝錫恩於去年七月一日夜半、忽至白爾部路五十一號伊之六弟家樓上、用手槍迫伊書寫、當時本擬報吿捕房、因恐彼受刑事處分、故祗馳赴大華醫院、吿知其母、嗣於其母死後、業挽三兄往錫恩家交涉、經其當三兄面、</p>
<p>將據撕毀</p>
<p>伊復於去冬登報聲明、以爲問題巳了等語、並呈出邱純甫之信一封爲證、但原吿謝錫恩聞邱所供、則頻頻搖首、繼復聲明立據之白爾部路五十一號、即被吿與母同居之所在、初以事涉彼等曖昧、殊不願言、該據亦由被吿自動書寫、且我從無手槍、何來强暴脅迫云云、末由兩造律師互相辯論一過、莫推事以尙須補傳人證、諭候改期再訊、</p>

，那種悽慘的景象，竟不能用筆墨來形容呢？　　可是伊們互相哭罷後，各人就做各人的工作，有小孩的，或給小孩飲乳，或替小孩解衣就睡，倘若沒有小孩的寡婦，只有做裁縫工作，等到夜深的時候，偶然想起了丈夫，性欲發動，於是大家不能入睡，互相談談性愛的話，到不能忍耐的辰光，就出外找尋異性。那時如果遇到急色兒，意志投合，彼此經過當地紳士的允許，可以結爲夫婦，從此得脫離寂寞的寡婦宿舍了。　　當伊們脫離寡婦宿舍的前一晚，必定要和着伊們的第二丈夫，穿了黑色的喪服，帶着一個和尙，前來燒香，還舉行三叩首的敬禮，據說這是寡婦念伊們前夫，而來表示謝罪而請求原諒的意思。但據名考古家菊池奧太郞的說法，伊們是向前夫招魂，使前夫的魂魄，投到伊們胎裏，究竟那一說法正確，刻無定評，不過據我的意見，似乎前說較爲近情。　　說起伊們寡婦第一夜宿於寡婦宿舍的時候，舉行一次很盛大的儀式，由當地紳士，在那鴿籠式的茅屋裏，主祭天地，致祭的時候，點着很短小的白蠟燭，並且燒香，由尼姑十六人，分爲兩列，立在茅屋的外面，吹着一種好像簫笛般的音樂，音樂的聲音，先由悲哀而漸漸雄壯慷慨，所以希望寡婦的生活，由悲哀而轉于雄壯，寡婦就在這雄壯的音樂聲中，緩步走入茅屋，那時在屋外的觀衆，都拍手歡呼，祝頌那寡婦前途的快樂，實際在這時候，寡婦的心，眞要粉碎呢。　　寡婦第一夜的化妝，好像是一個新娘，頭上批着一　淡灰色的絲巾，絲巾上有一點點的小紅花蕊，在燭光下輝映，似乎極爲美觀，畫眉點脂，更爲艷麗，而黑紗的衣服上，繡着一僩半月形的花紋，表示目前已非月圓時候，而在伊們的腰帶上，本來有各式各樣的花紋，而在那夜，只有一片白色，暗示冰淸玉潔之心，不再爲汚濁所染，就是所穿的木屐，也是淸一色而沒有花紋的。　　這種寡婦宿的風俗，最近經過內務省派員調査，認爲對於民智的發展方面，無利有弊，所以積極設法改善，但因爲這種風俗，相傳在中古時代，沿流至今，所以在最短期間內，不易完全破滅的。小西天  張恨水著　　第十八回　戚黨高舉逢迎斥小吏雌威大作嘈雜惱夫人　　李士廉道：這實在不勉强。我對於我的表哥，也就以大哥稱之的。這位裘先生來了，你就該直接去見他，爲什麽又寫封信去通知？介夫道：我和他早談了一個多鐘頭，寫這封信去，並不和他說什麽。我另有一個條陳託他轉呈給藍專員。實不相瞞，這裏面很有點政見。我把到西安以來，觀察所得，都寫在上面。一廉道：假如你老哥有了辦法，千萬不要忘了小弟。請到我屋子裏去坐坐，好不好？我還有上海帶來的兩個罐頭，打開來我們吃吃。說着，居然伸手就來拖着介夫的衣袖。介夫在這個時候，却也心皇皇無主，就也跟了他進房去，高談一陣。自然，說來說去，總少不了請專員代爲介紹官職一個問題。談了一陣子，忽然茶房進來道：張先生，前面藍專員派人請你過去。介夫聽到這裏，那一顆心，恨不得隨了脈搏，一下子由口腔裏跳將出來。兩手按了棹子，突然的站了起來，問道：什麽？是叫我去嗎？茶房道：怎麽不是？他們的聽差，還在側面等着。介夫向士廉頭一昂道：准是我那封信發生了效力。忽忽的就向外走。已經走到院子門口了，低頭一看身上，沒有穿着馬掛，這就發了瘋似的，跑回房去加上馬褂，一面扣着紐絆，一面向外走。（三〇二）</h3>

<p>申報國貨週刊貢獻話產銷運合作  仰葊　　國貨的發展，决不是靠着單方面的力量。最大的效力，在多方面的合作。前天京滬滬杭甬兩路管理局長黃伯樵先生在中華國貨產銷合作協會的講演，是很値得欽佩的。黃君說：國貨的進展，固然要靠同業的合作，尤其是要非同業的合作。什麽是非同業的合作呢？便是煤業要和鐵業合作，鐵業要和機器業合作，機器業要和製造業合作，製造業要和販賣業合作，產銷合作上再進一步，金融業要和產銷業合作，產銷業更要和轉運業合作，帮人家的忙，便是帮自己的忙。譬如我們路局處處替國貨界謀便利謀迅速，在國貨界固然得到許多利益，我們路局，也可以多做許多營業，多得到許多運費，結果是大家有利的。銀行界放欵於國貨界，國貨界的金融因此可以靈活，可以多做多少營業，可是銀行游資有所，藉此生財，銀行界也是有利。這便是同業合作的好處，以後諸位廠家，對於我們路局有不周到或不便利的地方，儘可隨時接洽，多多指敎務使我們服務的效力，儘量普遍，才可以對得起諸位廠家的屬望云云，這一席產銷運精誠合作的話，記者是十二萬分的敬佩。深願站在轉運界的當局，不論路局，招商局，乃至各個航業公司，都要革除官僚和買辦的惡習，處處予國貨廠商以便利和迅速，國貨界的發展，便在這種地方。國貨推銷術應改良的幾點  楊震民　　無疑的，這兩年國貨市塲的猛進，已有很顯明的表示，國貨工廠埋頭苦幹的精神，和國人努力提倡國貨的熱忱，實在是値得欽佩的，但是，我們現在有一大部分的國貨，仍舊不能和舶來品競爭，這並不是完全由於『質』的比不上人家，主要的原因，還在推銷術的幼穉，往往有一部分很好的國貨，因爲推銷不得法，使廠家蒙到重大損失，結果失敗，實在是最痛心的，現在且把應當迅速改良的幾點，略述如下；　　（一）多在鄉村間設分銷處——現在二十世紀的推銷商品法，是採用「廣播」和「利誘」的制度，試看美國的福特汽車公司，他的分行廣播遠東和歐洲，深入民間，一方面是在推銷他的貨品，同時她可以替你免費修理，這種「廣播」和「利誘」的雙管政策，我們的國貨工廠，不坊努力的採用，在全國的各處鄕間，多多的設立分銷處，使國貨深深的推銷，這種分銷處的範圍可以極小，用二個職員已足够，同時想方法替顧客免費服務　，使每個買主得到滿意，因而增加其信仰國貨的心理。　　（二）廣吿術的改進——舶來品的所以能够傾銷國內，雖然一部分原因是「質」的較佳，但是成功的最大的力量，還是歸根於廣吿，他們的廣吿，多麽的引人入勝，你從來沒有見過而不想買的東西，經過描寫精緻的廣吿來一個暗示，你自然地覺得滿意，結果有非買不可的趨勢，所以世界某著名經濟學家曾經說：「二十世紀是廣吿的世紀」，這話是一點也不差，國貨廣吿的設計和結構，實在太差，例如我們常用的「貨色好，價錢巧」廣吿，對於人們腦筋裏根本沒有什麼印像，這種廣告，是一定歸於失敗的途徑，一般的廣吿家，應當努力的運用他們精密的思想，用簡單的文字或圖書，去構成極深刻的廣吿，這實在是急不待緩的一個大問題。　　（三）避免無益的競爭大賤賣——我們目前國貨市塲犯的最大毛病，就是同業間的競爭大賤賣，這種大賤賣，當然也有他們特別的苦衷，例如存貨滯銷等，但是競爭大賤賣的結果，各方面都蒙到損失，每使一般商店或工廠無力營業，適以造成舶來品暢銷的好機會，這實在是再愚笨也沒有，我們假使遇到存貨銷路呆滯的情形發生，最好想法把這呆貨多多的分送到各分銷處去推銷或者到其他小碼頭起設立臨時國貨商塲，以便儘量的傾銷國貨，這實在是最好的辦法啊。　　以上所述的三點，實在是現在國貨推銷法急須改良的幾點啊！愛用國貨的農人  李家祿　　什麼婦女國貨年，學生國貨年，……最後我可大胆的說一句：「總歸是沒有美滿的結果的」。不信，我們祗要看歷年國際貿易，海關的紀錄，吿訴我們，每年輸入的貨物總數，都超過輸出的貨物總數，這是多麼的驚人呀！　　談到每年貿易入超的原因，實因國人服用外貨，已成爲一種牢不可破的習慣，一種普遍的現象，日久流毒過深，非短時期中所能革除而奏效的。　　所幸號稱以農立國的黃帝子孫，並沒有整個的完全洋化，試看一班終年勞苦的—農人—尤其是內地的農人，他們的確是愛國的中堅份子，他們根本不需要購買外貨，不願意購買外貨，看吧！——我們只要走進農村：　　（一）農人的衣服：談到他們所穿的衣服，大都是用自己親手織成的土布，雖然、式樣比不上都市裏人們所着的舶來品，那樣摩登，華美，妖艷，可是士布的質料，却非常柔軟，經穿，耐洗，外表又樸素，同時價格又低，那些洋貨布疋，恐難與之頡頏吧！　　（二）農人的食品：至於他們平日所吃的食物，多半是自己種的蔬菜，每逢年節，婚喪，也不過是粗魚笨肉，什麼山珍海味，魚翅海參，從不入口，根本也想不到這些東西，更不願意將有用的金錢，任意浪費，送給外人享用。　　（三）農人的住所：再談他們的住所，只不過茅屋數間，建築的材料，完全是國產，比不了闊人們的鋼骨水泥的高樓大厦，可惜泰半是外國的建築材料，說得好聽一點，是物質文明，說得痛快一點，簡直是推銷洋貨，其實住所只要合乎衛生的要素，也就够了。　　（四）農人的用具：我們只要走進農人的家裏，看看他們日常所用的什物和用具，完全是道地的國貨，因爲國貨具有下列的兩種特點：　　甲，國貨經久耐用，　　乙，國貨價格低廉；　　所以他們極願意購用國貨，換句話說：「只有國貨，才能使他們心滿意足」。　　我們看了以上的四點，便可知道農人愛用國貨的實在情形了。我們對之如何？　　話說完了。最後我希望大家，依照着農人愛用國貨的精神，一個個的做去。難道還怕我們的國家，沒有揚眉吐氣的一天嗎？談上海「土布」的歷史  淸癯　　像記得還是前月吧，中委吳稚暉先生，在首都市黨部裏演講，他說：十布運動，實爲關係中國生死存亡之運動，尤爲大多數人之一問題：故須由吾儕生活較舒適之居住都市人民發起，始克有效；幷說：服用土布，俾農村人民得有織布之機會，而享受服用售餘土布之利益；這兩段說話，都曾經載在報端，想熱心提倡國貨的人們，必定是看見過的：吾以爲遇着農村崩潰的當兒，確實有復興的必要，不過吳稚暉先生只說士布的好處，沒有提到是那一種士布，因爲內地以前所產的士布，是各處並非一樣的，儻要提倡，還須先經着手調査，才曉得已往的失敗和今後的改良之方法；吾且把上海從前自織的土布來，做個例子。　　有一部書叫「梧潯雜佩」，他書裏頭有一句，說：吾松以棉布衣被天下，吾看了，就明白當時凡隷在松屬底下的縣分，是都靠織布爲生活的，上海一縣，就是一個好榜樣：當那未曾開埠的時候，還是民風樸厚，依着十指，朝夕不停的做營生，你徜然走到村莊裏，耳朶中處處會聽得紡織之聲，不像現在的婦女們，拋了自己的手工業，跑到人家的廠裏去做機械的奴棣，廠家關起門來，管你整千整百的工人，也不得不失業了；閒話休說，上海當時所出的布，簡單講：有「扣布，「高麗布」，「希布」，三種，這三種布，以前統叫他是「粗布」，其實質料堅牢，而且又是經用，的確勝過別種布疋，還有叫他是「小布」的，則布紋細密，但門面稍狹，若尺幅寬闊，布紋密緻，出自三林塘的，叫他是「標布」，「標布」以外，還有「斜文布」，「正文布」，「斗文布」，「紫花布」等等，這幾種布，也可算得是上等布了；至用刀刮毛，叫他爲「刮絨布」，或且用巨石壓磨，就叫「踏光布」，要染顏色，用皮紙積褙，拕出花樣來，再用石灰來刷印，就成爲「印花布」，也有叫他是「藥斑布」，還有一種名叫「錦布」，色樣是非常富麗，和古錦一般，不過能織的人不多，所以出數也希少：當時產量最鉅，銷路最廣的布，要算「扣布」「希布」，以及「印花布」三種，價値極底廉，每疋只制錢二百餘文，最高三百餘文雖在六十年以前，比較今日，眞有天壤之別了：然而當時所謂「一夫不耕，或受之饑，一女不織，或受之寒」，農村中到也有喫有做，家給人足，眞是雍熙的景象，不是像眼前天天喊着農村破產，要人來救濟啊！那末；這樣講，提倡國貨，士布的確應當注意的一件事，就看印度的聖雄廿地，不是他始終抱定全民穿着土布，爲唯一救濟手工業來抵抗外貨的俊入麽？怎樣纔是一個現時代的好學生  怡怡館主　　唉！提起了『現時代』，眞是一個『非常的時代』啊！　　我國處在這個『非常的時代』中，國難重重。『內憂』是『農村崩潰』，『都市不景氣』。『外患』是『强鄰四迫』，『山河破碎』！這種危急的情狀，我們研究其癥結之所在，無非是爲了『經濟』的『破產』！　　說到『經濟』，爲什麼會『破產』喲？唉！說來是一言難盡。總而言之，不外乎爲的是半由於『天災』，半由於『人禍』。『人禍』之中，除了『兵戰』之外，還有最嚴重的所謂『商戰』！　　我們知道，『兵戰』的唯一利器，是『飛機大砲』。而『商戰』的唯一利器，便是大宗的『貨物』！外國的『貨物』，攏統的簡稱之，就是『洋貨』。我國的『貨物』，簡稱之，就是『國貨』。如今『洋貨』每年輸入我國的，價値數萬萬之鉅！換句話說，就是每年外國有價値數萬萬的『貨物』，運輸到我國來。我國便有數萬萬的銀子，流到外國去！一年一年的都是如此，數十年來到如今，都是這般。試問『國貨』那得抬頭？『經濟』如何會不『破產』呢？要知道，『經濟破產』，便是『商戰』慘敗的結果啊！　　唉！這樣看來，我們要度過這個『內憂外患交相煎迫』的『非常時代』，我們只有大家一致的服用『國貨』了！尤其是全國的男女學生們，在這個『學生國貨年』，快把『提倡國貨』的責任負起來。因爲，你們都是有了『學問』的『智識階級』。希望你們在學校內的時候，同學之間，要互相勉勵，要互相監督的服用『國貨』。走出了學校，無謂是在家庭中，或是在社會上，見了你們的兄弟姊妹，親戚朋友，也要勸導他們服用『國貨』。如果，能够這樣始終不渝的，隨時隨地的，自勉勉人。這纔不愧是一個現時代的好學生！國貨的印象  保志　　近年以來，提倡國貨的呼聲雖然很高，但是國貨的銷路大多數依然很是疲滯，這原因一方面由於國人迷信洋貨的心理，一方面也是由於國貨本身的薄弱　　要挽回這種情形，當然要力求出品本身的健全，使得國人對於國貨先有一種良好的印象。　　譬如說：肥皂是家常洗滌的要品，因爲它是日常需用的，所以它那優劣的印象也很容易印在人的腦海裏。國貨固本肥皂，現在能够在全國銷行最廣的原因，也就是因爲它能多洗衣服，能够久藏不變，能够不傷衣料，能够不退顏色，使得用過的人，都留下很好的印象，以後洗衣服非固本肥皂不用，這就是事實上的勝利。　　不在出品的本身上着想，只在口頭的上面呼號，那是沒有效果的今後希望全國的國貨製作者，都能振作起來，切實的研究，改良，拿出相當的成績給人看，使國人對於國貨都有一致的好的印象。買醉  張孟昭　　燈紅酒綠，管弦咿呀聲裏的酒樓「國貨居，」出現了熱心愛用國貨的某甲的踪跡！　　某甲：支頤憑窗，目光射到對面的洋貨店裏，生意與隆！喟然！擊桌的歎道：「國破家何在？傷心同胞用舶來！」　　堂倌：先生；嘆氣什麽？請你瞧瞧我們這裏的東西吧！　　某甲暗忖：這個「粗識之無」的堂倌，誠樸而愛護國貨的熱情流露！對面不知羞恥的洋貨老闆，眞和他差得遠了！不禁起了佩服的心！便對他微笑！回顧到這裏——國貨居——的一角，椅，桌，是紅木的，框床上，舖着三友社的美麗毛巾被毯，景德鎭的磁茶壺，杯，懸的是湘繡鏡架，江南紙的名人書，畫，地板上放着雲白銅痰盂，所佈置的，所見到的，件件是國貨！　　他快樂極了！對堂倌道：「國貨居」名符其實：那麽請你來個一瓶烟台啤酒，半斤紹興酒吧！一盆蝦，一盆菜，獨樂　樂！吃得酊酩大醉！塊壘盡消！稻草製紙的計劃（下）  天虛我生　　如由同鄉會駐滬推銷，另集股本，與農村合作社聯合專營，每以十元爲一股，但有一萬元之基金，亦卽可以周轉，試以八千元之純益，除一成公積外，按二十股派分，股東十成，卽四千五百元，是則每股十元，可得四元半矣。卽以三萬元基金論，亦得一元五角，若恐洋貨競爭，則以木漿比論，姑不論其來價如何，但就最近之事實論，五十噸之白木漿進口，所完稅餉墊頭等費，已需八百餘元，是每噸外貨核十六元矣。今以十四元四角一噸之草漿，加以漂白工程，至多一二倍，則每噸不過四十三元二角，若以白木漿比例，除十六元一噸之費外，豈外國貨能以二十七元二角一噸運到上海耶，卽以四十三元二角一噸計之，每磅不過核本二分，則儘可以自造新聞印刷用之卷筒報紙，其價可以大廉而特廉。試以令數爲比例，每令重四十五磅，則料本不過九角，加以煤電人工

<p>自由談表現於舊俄文學的幾種形態  梅雨　　當我們接觸着舊俄的文學的時候，從那些作品裏，我們見到的除開陰沉，憂鬱與感傷的氣分而外，簡直找不到旁的什麼東西。有人把這歸之於當時斯拉夫人的氣質，因爲所有的斯拉夫民謠差不多儘是陰鬱的。然而我想由沙皇統治所造成的陰暗的環境當是產生這一類作品的主要理由吧。　　本來，當舊社會瀕於破滅，而新的制度又未創生的時候，舊的一切都在動搖崩潰之中，現存的社會的一切的思想，文化與道德等等亦不爲追求光明的人們所信仰。所以在這變革的過程中，舊意識還沒擺脫凈盡的人們，在這矛盾的生活中，自然就不免失去常態了。他們咀咒黑暗，然而黑暗仍然像夢魔一樣壓着他們，他們企期着光明，可是新生的曙光仍然還未從現出來，因而他們對於光明的到來始終是糢糊的，懷疑的，於是就大多感到絕望而不可避免地感傷起來了。這現象在十九世紀末的舊俄的文學裏是表現得最鮮明不過的。他們或者抱着「默示錄」的幻想，作着天外的夢；或是拜倒於神秘的壇下，找尋着理想的「美姬」；或是凝視着永恒的混沌之內，感到「恐怖與瘋狂，瘋狂與恐怖，」而咀咒生，讚美死；或者以爲人生是虛無的，於是尋求着肉慾的滿足，而以尼采的反道德，作爲掩飾的外衣。這些人們雖然都是沉溺在感傷與絕望的大海裏，然而他們亦是找尋過光明的人，大都懷着一顆熾熱的心的。他們一面發着痙攣，一面却憧憬着曙光，希企着光明的。我們能够說戈哥里在絕望之中，會原恕一切的醜惡麼？就是感傷氣分特濃的契訶夫，在「三姊妹」中亦曾說過這樣的話：「再過二三百年，這人世的生活大槪會成爲耀眼地美麗和燦爛的吧。」再如讚美死的安特列夫，在有名的短篇「黑暗」，他以黑暗戰勝光明，借娼妓的口說出世界永遠是黑晤的這句話，但是這是他在找求不到光明的絕望之後發出來的哀號。亦許就是有這一點，使舊俄的文學博得世界的愛好吧。　　然而他們雖然渴望光明，可是卻都沒有找到到達光明的路。他們始終在黑暗中摸索着，碰壁着。這是因爲他們沒有眞正地理解社會演進的必然的過程的緣故。所以他們永遠沒有把住這黑暗與光明的樞紐，沒法衝出感傷，恐怖同黑暗的雰圍。甚至當光明已經孕生的時侯，他們亦一味咀咒着它，「灰色馬」裏就有這樣的話：「革命的結果是什麼呢？總督被刺了，然而又來一個總督，我們的獲得是什麼呢？」而安特列夫更歇斯特里地喊出「S．O．S．」來，至於布寗與庫普林，却面色慘白地逃到那「潮潮的，暖暖的，」俗物主義者的巢穴裏去。　　這樣說來，要由黑暗中摸索到光明的路，着實不是一樁輕便的事情，那些不曾陷於絕望的人，如托爾斯泰一樣亦只有將最後憑藉期之宗敎。就是托斯托也夫斯基這樣深沉的人，在「加瑪拉佐夫兄弟」（Brother，Kamaeagou）中，雖想指出一條光明的出路，可是仍然不是現實的可行的，而是架空的路子。他把書中的主人公阿里奧沙（Alyosha）寫成爲一個大慈大悲的救世主，仍不免是一個超越的存在。把光明，把未來的希望寄託在上帝身上，明眼人就曉得這並不是得到光明的正路。世上追求光明的人是那麽多，然而永遠爬不出黑暗的角落的人亦是那麽多，這悲劇，我們可以在許多文學作品裏看到。　　在這裏，我想提一提羅曼羅蘭。當他寫第一部「被魅惑的靈魂」（EnchantedSoul）時，由於他自己的世界觀，他把書中的女主人公引進一條死胡同裏，而茫然不知所往。可是到了最後一卷，他才把她解放出來，完成爲一個撓勇的時代的戰士。這裏就是「被魅惑的靈魂」較之「若望·克里士朶夫」（JeanCheitophe）更爲偉大更爲出色的原因。羅蘭之所以能走到光明的路來，第一是由於他不把文學當爲消閒的東西（這一點跟上面許多舊俄作家是一樣的）；其次就是他在人類今日正在經騐着這大悲劇中，他跟羣衆混在一起，共同感到一個體制的悲劇與另一個體制的誕生的喜劇，他的呼吸與全體呼吸的是合着節拍的。這就是羅蘭偉大的地方，亦就是他能獲得光明的路的最好的保障。　　由這許多事實吿訴我們，那麽，我們心中正燃着不滅的希望的火的年靑的人們，在尋求光明的過程中，是應該多麼小心地去握住這光明與黑暗的樞紐呵！械鬥  黑嬰　　這天報紙上記載了驚人的海外消息，那華僑和土人集團械鬥的蘇門答臘島正是我的生長地。我的家還在那里的首府棉蘭的一條並不怎樣熱閙，多少還保留着原始狀態的街上，械鬥雖然是東部實武牙那一邊起一始的，可是種埃的爭鬥常常會很快地擴大起來的，我不能希望械鬥不蔓延到棉蘭去。放下報紙默然地在窗前站了一會，望着天空的秋意的行雲我在記憶裏邊拾起逝去了的時間——有一年，也曾經有過一次的械鬥。　　事故的開端常常是非常糢糊的，那時候我的年紀很小，事前簡直一點也不知道。早上，照樣我起得比母親還早，拖着木屐，脫光了衣服到冲凉房里去，水是冷的，可見冲在多吃了辣椒的人的身體上却化成一陣蒸氣，冒了出來。等到大家都起了床，準備吃早飯的時候我巳經唸了一頁書，打算一吃完飯就上學校去。　　可是飯吃到一半的時候有人急激地撞進來了。他的抖悸的聲音呌着我的父親，一面說：「知道麼，外邊不得了！外邊現在……巳經跟番鬼仔幹起來了！」　　我不知道那算是怎麼一回事。放了飯碗，我聽着那個急怱忽忽的來客給父親講述着，說是番鬼仔怎樣在夜里把××咖啡店的東家弟弟用巴蘭刀戳死了。　　「戳得慘呀，」他咬緊牙根地說下去，「肚腸全瀉了出來，死狗一樣地躺在馬路上。他的老婆哭得什麽似地，簡直在地上打滾……」　　「他們爲什麼戳死他？」父親問道。　　「這個麽，說來話長呀！你現在準備一下吧，要把門戶關好，出門要小心；小孩子最好禁在家里！」　　於是那個人便走了。　　我果眞給父親禁在家里，一步也不許我出門。我爭持着必需到學校里去，但是如果出去的確是危險的，當此殺人的氣熖高張的時候，一個沒有抵抗力的孩子不是白白要—「總而言之你不能出去。」對着我說了，父親囑咐着母親和家人要極力看管我。他却穿好衣裳打算上公司去走一趙。　　「你頂好也不要出去。」祖母說。　　「我不要緊。」他說。　　母親一聲也不響。可見從她那不轉睛地送着父親出門的神色上，我發現她有一顆比誰都不安的心。這時我有點好奇，想着如果能跟着父親到外邊去走一次該是多麽好。整天禁在家裏不出去的習慣我是沒有的，所以，心裏異常的煩悶。偶然乘着人家不防備的當兒打開了一綫窗，從小小的窗隙裏偷望一下街上：本來靜寂的街如今是更加地　無人聲了。械鬬的白熱地帶自然不是我們這一邊，所以一點動靜也沒有。我們在等着父親的回來。　　跟平日一樣地到午膳時刻他就在門外按鈴了。女佣人膽怯地去應了門；知道是屋主人回家了，立即又很歡喜地打開門。在午膳時，父親爲我們說到械鬬。起因直到現在還不十分明瞭。大概是那個咖啡店的東家弟弟時常帶着同伴到土人的住宅區去，勾上了土人的妻子；後來這秘密被發現了，那被侮辱了丈夫的就引了同伴到咖啡店裏來尋仇。這樣兩方衝突起來。那是昨天日裏的事。夜裏土人再次來襲，東家的弟弟終於就死在他們的刀下了。　　「那麽還有別的什麽人受傷沒有」？祖母問。　　「不太淸楚了，」父親送了一口飯到嘴裏去，「大概一定有的。等會見報紙出了版就可以知道了。」　　對於這種擾亂治安的械鬬，當地的殖民政府自然得盡力彈壓的。但是那時候兩個種族間巳經仇視得一觸即發了；我們這條街上也很快地發現土人把石子擲到中國人的住家來的事情。於是街上馬上加了警察巡邏。我就足足兩天沒有走出大門的機會。　　第三天父親從外邊回來給我們報吿了好消息，械鬬終於解决了。我們歡喜得不想問到怎樣解决的。我像一隻出籠之鳥似地走到街上來，行人還不多，商店也沒有完全復業。衝突雖然緩和了，但是看到番鬼仔心裏總藏着敵意，而且在認識的人面前都這樣。一直不知道過了多少時候，才消滅了這一塲械關的痕跡……　　然而在我巳經成長起來，遠遠地離開了那生長地的現在，又聆到這可佈的械鬬的聲音了。同是這弱肉强食的世界上的受難的民族，為什麽要自相殘殺？為了人類的幸福，是有携手奮鬥的必要的；想到這裏我不能抑止我的痛心了。誕生  大保　　像預見生之苦痛，　　一落地就嘩嘩的哭喊。　　有千萬個先人這樣喊過呢，　　可是這原始的抗拒，　　有誰能避開往後的生活的苦難？　　「好好壞壞，　　總得有個後代來繼承燈火呵」　　母親，在苦痛中這樣唸。　　她祈禱這新生命的長成，　　望着天窗的曙光，　　誠心乞求神明的保佑和憐憫。　　「亂兵拉走了你的父親，　　生命向誰依靠？」　　低着頭，像預見日後難忍的結局。　　「生逢亂世，生命原是一個累墜！」　　咒詛着，她開始流淚……家庭裏的風波  西村　　大林嫂早晨起來很早，她是個過門不過兩個月的新媳婦，自然作事要殷勤些的。　　她才只十九歲，年靑靑的，像所有一般年靑姑娘媳婦一樣，都有她値人喜愛的地方，這就是說，她的人長得還端正也不缺少聰明，尤其是一對含笑的眼睛，呌看過的人沒有不歡喜的。　　大林呢，雖是個鄉下人，却知道怎樣愛護一個好妻子，因而小夫妻兩人的感情非常融洽，兩個來月沒有紅過一次臉，吵咀的事情更談不到了。　　現在大林嫂在婆婆屋子裏擦拭器具，她這是遵照婆婆的話作的，她進門來第四天的早晨，婆婆這樣吩咐她：　　「早晨起來先把我的屋子收拾好，再作別的事情，聽到麽？」　　就從那一天起，她早上起來除了梳洗頭腦算是第一件事外，第二件事就是到婆婆屋子里收拾屋子。　　背地里，大林也常常和顏悅色囑託她一些話：　　「媽媽老了，有時說話對不對，全要你原諒一點。你不可以違背她的意思作事情，她好歹總是我的媽呀。她脾氣不好我也知道，可憐他守了十年寡，守着我成人，你只記住這一點好處就行了。」　　大林嫂聽從着丈夫的話，有時婆婆眞同她發起脾氣來，她當眞一聲不響，就像沒那麽一回事似的，而且她還是照當作事情，還照常給婆婆送上一袋烟，笑着說：　　「媽媽，抽一袋吧。」　　兩個月內大林嫂作事情很順手，屋子收拾滿乾凈，燒飯洗衣全稱職，就是婆婆也常常對別人誇獎她的兒子媳婦怎樣能幹，並且還說她從此以後，家里的事情可以放手了，也不枉她守了多年的寡。今早，大林嫂在擦着婆婆的鏡子，這面鏡子實在太老了，倒有一半地方退了水銀，她每次擦着時，總是特別用些氣力，爲的要想把鏡面擦亮些。她擦着擦着，不知怎的，忽然覺得一陣昏眩，口里面像是要嘔吐，一失神，讓手里鏡子落到地上了。　　鏡面碎了，她拾起的是一個空鏡框子，嚇慌了，心里撲登撲登地跳起來，望着碎鏡片發呆。　　——未完——愛情（六）  S．爾塞吉夫·晋斯基作蘇明譯　　他那翻轉了的船，現在是這麽深深的埋葬在雪裏，他祇能猜出牠在那裏。所以在過了無數的無盡期的寒冷和黑暗的日子以後，天開始明朗起來，而寒冷也沒有那麼使人麻木，而且他看到船的黑色的龍骨顯露在雪外的時候，他幾乎呌了起來，「好了，牠們沒有拿掉牠。」　　一片拳頭大的蔚藍的天空出現了，沙瓦卡向着那黑暗的樹林，向着那依舊給冰凝固着的河流，向着那開始在柔軟的雪地上跳動的殘留下來的狼羣，呌喊起來。　　幾乎冰塊一破裂，河水一汎濫，沙瓦卡馬上就快樂的迥轉他的船到河裏去，載着他的全部財產，包括了那些狼皮，在漿旁坐下來，於是沿着他那骯髒的，黃色的河流遠遠的向北部前進。他是獨自一個人在他的小船裏，在一條膨脹的河流上，在現在相隔那麼遠，以致在河中央看不見了的兩岸中間，環繞着像狼一樣不懷好意的大松樹，牠們似乎都像他一樣朝向北方，拼命傾向海洋。沙瓦卡充滿了一種快樂的溫暖的感覺，尊敬起他自己，他的壯健的身體，他的頑强的性格，甚至他的這莽撞的冒險。　　「紅的頭，」他大聲的呌喊着。「你應該現在來看看沙瓦卡·考爾特。」　　河流載着他有兩個月了。當他疲倦了的時候，他會划到岸邊，拿出他的來福槍來打一會獵，然後再去睡覺。兩岸變得平坦，荒蕪，確薄了—北極的隰原。前面有什麽，沙瓦卡一點都不驚奇。但是所有的時間他都在想那也像他一樣向着北方前進，尋找海洋的人們。他竟沒有遇到一個人，但是他也許還會遇見他們的。　　有一天，當他熟睡在船上的時候，他被一種突然的震動所驚醒。一看他的船漂入浮在近旁的一稞龐大的松樹裏，橫斜了，纏結在樹枝裏。沙瓦卡竭力用槳去給自己淸除障礙，但僅祗是把漿折斷了。於是，忿憤的爬上船頭去，開始用他的斧頭來坎松樹枝。但是松樹捲流而下，把船也捲去，差不多把牠傾覆了。沙瓦卡跌落在水裏，而船，還是浮現在水面，開始在向下流漂浮去。沙瓦卡冷得要凍結了，他想，「哦，這就是結局。」但他緊抓住松樹，他的斧頭掉到河底裏去了。　　又濕又冷，他　跨在松樹上，當他的船就在他眼前漂浮了去的時候，他幾乎哭了。在他絕望之餘，他的幸運降臨了。那船又給另外一棵大樹所糾纏住。沙瓦卡穿着濕淥淥的羊皮外套和一半浸滿了水的沉重的皮靴，攀椽着，泅泳着，在水裏奮勇而前，一直到他能够達到小船邊上的時候。他總算爬上了船邊。疲倦了，他沉沒到河底裏。這以後他行麼都不記得了，直到他終於在一隻英國船上醒來，就在河口上，而且的的確確在北冰洋裏了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言侮辱女性文字  夢若　　前日市府奉內政部通吿，査禁侮辱女性文字，茲市府已轉飭各報社遵照，以後不得登載此類文字，免予社會以不良影響。據江蘇省會婦女會呈請査禁理由謂：「竊維國內各地報紙，每有侮辱或謾駡女性一類文字。或新聞之登載，察其內容，雖非全無根據，但類多徒知消極的暴露女性弱點，而鮮有積極的指導婦女正軌，其結果非獨有損全體婦女之令譽，抑且妨害整個社會之風化，　為矯正視聽，維護女權起見，實有呈請嚴禁登載之必要。」　　侮辱女性一類文字，在國內各地報紙，有時的確可以看到。這類文字，不必牽上什麽「令譽」或「風經，」單言其動機的惡劣和輕浮，都有加以糾正的必要。但這類滿紙侮辱的文字，究竟很少。若暴露女性弱點的文字，就比較的多。然這類文字，却不能認爲是侮辱。至少，它總有喚醒女性的消極作用。何况它的內容，又是有根據的。要是女性中沒有那種弱點，它也便無從暴露。　　退一步說，就算這類暴露女性弱點的文字，也不免帶有幾分侮辱的成分，是以損壞婦女令譽和妨碍社會風化。但要矯正視聽而維護女權，僅靠査禁尙是一種消極作用，事實上女性的弱點，仍然存在。故在糾正之外，女性更須進一步的作一番自身的檢討。檢討後如發見有什麽弱點，又應立刻改善。如此，女性的弱點，才有除去的希望。馬來人的生活  從龍　　高踏峇魯的馬來人的生活，多數是從事農業和園藝的。當你的「風車」　出了市中心區到郊外去的時候，你可以瞧見一望無際的濃密的椰林和靑翠的稻田蓋覆在澄澈蔚藍的穹天底下，嫵媚媚地迎着熱帶的暖風微笑，牠的姿態是多麽瀟洒，秀麗的呵！　　馬來土人的種田的方法是這麽的簡單的：當每年於他們的馬來曆的十一月間播下種子，（約莫當我們國曆的八月的時候）在未播下種子之前，先鋤割去稻，田間蓬亂的蕪草，然後放了一把火燒起來，等到天下了雨，田地潮濕，於是，把秧禾毫無倫次隨便地揷下去，這樣，種子就播成功了，那麽，他們就祗有坐着等收穫吧了。他們一年的農忙平均不上兩個整月，同時，又不需去下肥，耘草；更沒有旱災，水災；而且生出來的產物，又豐富，又佳好。一年祗耕種一次，收穫一次，巳够一家幾口兒整年的開銷而有餘！因此，對於甚麽事情都覺得沒有勁兒，他們有充分的時間可以懶散，偸安，閒扯，漫不經意地悠悠然把辰光揮走了。　　他們的收穫的方法的幼稚，簡直像原始時代似的，更使人覺得好笑！當稻穗成熱的時侯，我們可以瞧見許多棕黑色的臉孔在辣熱的陽光底下，手股上掛看一隻小竹籃，在田裏摘着那已熟的金黃的稻穗，——一串一串慢慢地摘着。然後把這些稻穗積聚起來，幾個人赤着足板在上面走動，彷彿法國葡萄區裏的娘兒們的軋葡萄汁般的，把榖粒軋出來。這些不知道在幾世紀前的他們的祖先傳留下來的方法，迄今還是「遵古法製」一年一年地依樣胡蘆着，他們從不想改良，也不知道世界上的農業已萬進入機器化和電氣化了。</p>

<p>高踏峇魯的馬來人，可以說全都信仰回敎。他們相信天神「亞拉」是世界上萬物的創造者，字宙間最有權力的無上尊神；他們的所有的一切，都是天神「亞拉」的賜予的。因此，他們每天要很虔誠地唸五次可蘭經。（回敎的經典）每逢星期五，他們就是有甚麽天大的事情，也都得停止的，一齊到敎堂裏朝向西方，兀立在地上唸經，祈禱，這一天高踏峇魯的戲院，照例是要停演的。他們對於曾經到過謨罕默德的生長地——麥加——的頭頂戴着黑色絨帽或白帽的「阿施」，尊敬的有如長老，這些人在這個地方上是最有權勢的。　　馬來人還有一種「割禮」，據說這是舊敎的敎規，可是，現在在高踏峇　還是依然施行着，而且視爲莊嚴重大的事件。每個男人在發育之前，須受偕侶把生殖器的包皮割去一小片，女的於生育之後，也得受僧侶在陰唇上用針刺破，滴出一滴滴的血珠來，這正像每個暹羅人終生得皈依佛門，做一次和尙一樣。非如此，就不能親近天神，受天神的施惠，保謎；而且要受人們的奚落，鄙視，擯棄，孤孤獨獨地消磨過一生哩！中年  凌秄錫　　在無人問訊的日子裏，在寂寞中，我終於從遠地的相識者的手札中，找出了一些使人發抖的，不愉快而驚駭的句子來了：這是像一根刺着心的針一樣的「人到中年百事哀！」　　像無人的深夜中襲來的惡夢，與傳到了强烈的電流一樣的，瞧着這，我驚慌地跳起身來了；「中年」！那樣的一種晦暗而不詳的詞兒哪，她所暗示給人的，除去了陰森的沈落，此外便更會有一點什麼呢？　　是一個解答不開的謎啊，「人到中年百事哀！」　　可是，我祈求，千萬別再用這些可怕的語句來提醒（不，刺傷）我罷，在難以對付的生活中，在層層堆積的慘痛與不快意中，我也算是那麽久遠地渡着過來了，而今想起來，已僅僅像一堆破殘的探險的夢了（然而在這短短可是却黝黑的生之歷程中，探險人又幾曾有過他底準備與行裝呢？是赤裸裸的孤獨的身子，而每個險惡的風浪又是像迅雷」一樣地打來的。）然而卽使是短短的路程也好，它是不堪設想地險惡的，走着它，是需要勇氣，需要强頑，需要勞苦，需要靑春的啊——而現在則是，許多豐盛的要素全在生存的苦難中低落下去，而且如今又據說是「中年」了哪！　　是褐色的名詞，是有着無數可怕的代價的名詞呀。　　像一個失去了雨具而茫然站在大雨中的孤獨的路人，站在這淋漓的荒士上，我看到了褐色之暮日，我茫然了。　　人生的路（而且，又是不毛的荒地啊）究竟有多長，那是難以測想的，而在這上面迂迴着的無數的生物，也正像下行的水流一樣地，不斷的被一種力量所推動，所傾擠着，叫人欲止不能地沿着這多荆棘的道路直瀉下去；於是，人從嬰孩的笑渦兒中給擠到紫色的少年的熱情中去，從少年再行到褐色的中年，於是，跟着灰色的老年也就來了；放在最後的還得算是墳墓，這，跟死亡一樣，是烏黑的。　　拋棄罷—也許有人那麼想—拋棄了幻想，拋棄了希望，拋棄了熱情，也拋棄了力量與勞苦罷。　　然而，對一個從近於死滅的巨浪裏泅着過來的人，這是不甘心的。苦難，牠們底目的是爲了什麽呢，難道說就那麽輕易而無條件地，把一切人間的力量全拋藥了嗎？　　不忍這樣的呀；然而，有什麼辦法呢—勇氣與力量全像日暮的太陽那麽地沈落下去了，是「中年」了啊！　　是的，毫無疑慮的，像個在薄泳上淌着的孩子，一失足，就不可挽回地行盡了靑春的路，而落進中年的冰窟中去了。在寒冽的黑水中，人將開始一個可怕的「中年」了。　　也不用再死命地去惦念三春的日子了，那是沒有用的；心腔裏已經與髮絲上同樣地添上了灰白的星星（這也算是「生之經騐」的記錄的嗎），而人則蒼茫得像霧夜的月亮了。　　心像深秋時分收割後的田圃一樣的，漸漸地感到荒寂與冷漠起來了，且學着把什麽都看得很輕，這心情是以前所沒有經到過的，難道說，這就是所謂「百事哀」了麽？　　於是，拿起筆，我給相識者寫着：「是的，無可挽回地，我們都已落進中年了；可是，也隨他罷，去看一看褐色的心情，也許是新奇的……」　　這樣，我開始了中年的日子……迎秋散曲  史綠邨　　—給蓮妮　　迎着八月末的黃昏，輕輕吹來的是帶着秋天的蕭瑟味的晚風。蓮妮，你在？那里呢——想着桂花黃時麗哇栗妲河上的漫遊，你吹噓着栗子的氣息吿訴我『瞧哪：天邊的不是一片紅色的彩霞麽？』我是紅色的戀慕者；然而我却不是社會主義的信徒。斜躺下來用着我的手指敲着船舷，一面「在五月的良夜里，蓮妮！」那麼地唱着，我覺渴我是愛着你了。　　（我愛蓮妮那南方菜子園里的荔枝核似的眼珠子。當我面對着它們的時候，從那最深度的黑色里邊我會感受到她的溫柔的。有的時候我從那里邊挖出藏在她的心里的秘密：一個少女的內心的秘密啊。）　　（我愛蓮妮的懂事的小小的，櫻桃似的嘴巴。從它里邊山泉般地噴出來，給我以淸凉的感覺的不心是蓮妮的嘴巴麼？忘不了的是那塗在唇片上的Tangee的刺激味。當我吻着她的時候，像生了一千對翅膀似地，，我猛地飛起來了！）　　蓮妮還有蛇樣的腰肢的呢。那天在Martopol舞着的時候她永遠微微地笑着。『你瞧：那邊檯子旁邊指着我們說話的不是傻瓜麽？』順着她的視綫瞧了遠去：怪起勁地在對着人家說話的正是我的舊朋友呢。　　過後我問了他：『你覺得蓮妮怎麽哪？』　　『尤物呵！』感嘆似地說了。『跟你舞着的時候像一條花班蛇纏住你的身子似地，她有蛇樣的身肢。什麽時候讓我認識她吧，行嗎？』　　『可是你沒有打蛇的本領呵！』那麼說着我便走開去了。　　蓮妮，聽見嗎？社會主義者以外的男子是會爲你而膜拜的。他說你是一條花班蛇，可是當你趁着九十度的夏天跑到游泳池的跳板上活躍着往水里鑽去時，『人魚哪！』我站在池岸邊驚喊起來了。　　夏是蓮妮喜愛的季節。不是嗎？御下了狐皮外套，讓一件維也納的薄紗發裹着你的身子，脚上不着襪子地飄到我的Anartment里來的不是熱得炙手的蓮妮嗎？夏天的季節夢是那樣地圍讓着我，獨身漢只能在夜靜的時候坐在無綫電的面前聽『在五月的良夜里，蓮妮！』的播送。　　而現在，夏是悄悄地，連一聲再會邊不說便走開了我的周遭。迎着向晚的八月末的凉風，恒念着我的蓮妮，我記起你的荔枝核似的眼珠子和櫻桃似的嘴巴。我記起了蓮妮的一百種好處。可是蓮妮你在那里呵我伸出一百雙手來摟抱你，我用一千種語言呼喚你。　　已經是秋天來的季節了。『蓮妮呢，蓮妮是秋天寂寞時的好伴侶啊，』聽着這樣的話我里急着街頭巷角地走，從這一邊到那一邊，找尋着失去了夢！失去了的人！　　什麽時候你會燕子那麽地歸來呢？江南的秋日是明媚的，蓮妮。衣箱亭  李淡　　當浩渺的海面的遠處，漸漸的，隱約現出靑山的時候，苦困在顚搖着的輸船上的旅人們，開始露出歡悅的神容了。跳躍着期待而興奮的心情，望到了美麗的九十九灣的西貢港，誰都以爲便將離開苦悶的海洋的旅程，而登上安息的目的地。　　靑靑的原野，飄飄的柔風，淸朗朗的天空，南國的容姿，輕鬆帶笑的迎着旅客們。我心裏暗忖着：沒錯，這是個好地方哪！　　船靠岸了，自由的手脚，不能自由的跨上好地方去安息。旅客們的歡情全消失了，只有麻煩，焦燥，疲倦，痛苦，恥辱。經過了許多怪異的手續，變成失去自由的人。最後，從新客衙放出來，又得上衣箱亭去，這時候，誰個都嘆息起來了：　　『旅程到達可怕的異域！』　　從新客衙踉蹌的走出來，身體是　復了自由，但行李還沒有得到自由。行李送到衣箱　去。那又是一個關，大家</p>

<p>爭先恐後的擠上去，但却放不下心，這個關又怎麽的呢？　　天快暮了，今天頒不到得待明日，大家不得不拚命擠，東西不拿到手，總是不安心的，擠得太紛亂了，裏面的皮鞭拍拍拍的飛舞着，人堆像崩潰的堤凌亂的倒下來；着了鞭子的摸着傷痕，大家瞠目驚望。我像闖入了怪異的國度裏去，心忐忑的跳着，渾身酸痛疲倦得難以支持下去。而這裏的主人却罵：「你們這些支那人，像野猪！」　　我不曉得我爲什麼這麽膽子小，我聽着鞭子揮動的聲音，高響的叫喊；看見不露笑容的，威嚴的立着的主人，執行檢査而翻箱倒囊的土人，和從出門檻給推下來的同胞們，那難看的氣色，亂七八糟的行李，囂雜的咒駡，我像自己蒙了大難在身似的，我悔不該到這稱爲黃金地的異域來！　　幾回鼓起勇氣，掙扎着擠上去，總擠到滿身是汗時，却又逢着鞭子便滾回來！　　「你們這些支那人，像野猪！」這聲音又在盪漾。　　我不懂番話，不知道上那冀去頒但我們的行李，只是驚惶的站着呆望。取我的目光不敢接觸着座上惡狠狠的高梧的主人。而他，却正猛烈的注射着我們這羣野猪的支那人。　　碰了幾個釘子，給推來推去，總算見到了我那只皮箱。我記得我是上鎖的；然而，沒有開過的箱，箱裏面却早就亂得像垃圾堆。我只喘着急氣，眼巴巴看着檢査的人把箱內東西不住的撩，有的便撩在箱外去。我的眼前覺得有點糢糊。他撩出兩套白綢新衣裳，用着我聽不懂的話向我辦什麽交　。話猶未停，另一個又撩出幾尺布，我簡直將失去了知覺了。但我看看旁邊有同樣的情形，而東西的主人，是摸出錢交上去，有的還吃了耳光。我非常駭怕那粗大的手掌。終於，我也急拿出鈔票，不够，加到七塊！之後，給一推，手裏抱着的皮箱又落下，走出了衣箱亭，我莫名其妙的流下幾滴淚來！望着天，不復是淸朗朗的，目光有點看不淸。播音節目彈詞　　程方舟李蓮蓀毛家書　　華美（一〇六〇）下午三時至三時三刻　　開篇「醒紅樓夢」　　情天寳鑑本無情。假託太虛幻境生。色即是空空即色。十二金欽列畫屛。他是假造女媧一片石。飲風吸露竟通靈。又說是無端想入非非境。頑石旁邊有草一莖。世間性有無情石。他反說頑石生來却有情。世間最賤春來草。偏說他人間第一有情人。若有情。若無情。編入紅樓便不情。你看他榮寗兩府裙釵女。有那個美滿良緣眷屬成。林黛玉。史湘雲。薛寳釵。賈元春，非夭即寡了殘生。千玲百琍王熙鳳。到後來聰明反自誤聰明，有了好書不善讀。把醒世文章當着眞。失足情塲眞可惜。縛繭春蠶脫不了身。害人總怪曹雪芹。現在世情還是看賈雨村。歌唱　　星星歌唱社　　新新（七八〇）下午六時至七時　　漂泊者（白燕）新婚之夜（飛虹）寒衣曲（朱琪）摩登戀愛（飛亞）寳寳睡覺吧（白燕）光明之路（飛虹）你要那一個抱（朱琪）關外高歌（飛亞）　　百老匯歌劇社　　大中華（一一六〇）下午六時至七時　　娘子軍歌（葉英）楊柳絲絲（飛莉）愛情如玫瑰（英茵）離別了姑娘（徐傑）永別了弟弟（葉英）紫羅蘭（飛莉）安眠（英茵）　　美玲團　　航業（一一八〇）下午六時至七時　　新毛毛雨（前奏曲）漂搖曲（賴玲）寄給父親的詩（黃韻）休息五分鐘（程瑩）春樂（程英英）舟中曲（王佩佩）離別了姑娘（王超）戰地之花（靜美）十里長亭（黃韻）漁光曲（余雪麗）</p>

<h3>Bandits Inside and Outside the Great Wall Line Coordinate with Each Other</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) More than 1,000 bandits, well-armed and wearing armbands with the symbols of the North China Autonomous Army, have recently been discovered in the Yangdaohe Dongjiakou area near Xinglong on the Great Wall Line. Led by the bandit leader Yang, known as "Sitting Mountain Eagle," they are coordinating with the bandits led by "Occupying Mountain Tiger" outside the pass, planning to sneak into the Great Wall Line. The Japanese and puppet troops in Xinglong have begun to be on alert. The bandits led by Li Laobao near Hongshankou in Zunhua have not withdrawn and appear to be moving westward to contact the bandits in Xinglong. The Zunhua local defense force was on alert inside the Great Wall Line on the 27th. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The bandits entrenched in the Yanqing 2nd, 4th, and 5th districts of Chahar established a false headquarters in Zhenzhuquan, calling themselves the North China Autonomous Army. They are divided into six brigades. The 1st and 2nd brigades are remnants of Liu Guitang's bandits, under the command of Wang Yanru. The 3rd to 6th brigades are former subordinates of Sun Dianying, under the command of Wang Daoyi, each brigade consisting of approximately 800 to 900 men. The Yanqing County Magistrate, finding it difficult to suppress them, sent personnel to negotiate with Wang, intending to appease them, but Wang refused to comply. On the 26th, they planned to cross the Sihai Pass and sneak in. The Wang bandits on the Great Wall Line, upon hearing this, led their troops to intercept them, and the two factions engaged in a firefight. All districts in Yanqing 2nd, 4th, and 5th were ravaged. The County Magistrate urgently telegraphed the provincial government requesting assistance in suppressing the bandits. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Water Level of Weishan Lake Increases; Flood Prevention Association Dispatches Comfort Team</h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Weishan Lake rose again on the 28th, with the water level reaching 36.577 meters. The situation in Yaowan and Suqian along the Middle Canal is even more dangerous. Yaowan rose four inches on the 28th, with a water level of 13.76 chi. Suqian rose three inches, with a water level of 1.57 zhang. Qingjiang is still stable, with a water level of 2.3 zhang. Suqian and Sishui counties each levied 5,000 labor days to assist Pi in building the Bulao River embankment, and the laborers were dispatched on the 28th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to the Canal District Flood Prevention Office, the water level of Weishan Lake fell by one fen today, recorded at 36.577 meters. Yaowan rose four inches, with a water level of 1.76 zhang. Suqian rose three inches, with a water level of 1.57 zhang. Qingjiang is stable. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Hanzhuang Water Station telegraphed that the lake level has reached 36.555 meters, exceeding the water level of 1915. The Middle Canal is rising rapidly. The Xuzhou-Yellow River Disaster Relief Association dispatched teams yesterday to investigate the disaster. The Flood Prevention Association dispatched a comfort team today to comfort the Jinpu Horizontal Embankment and the Second Division Tax Police Corps and Ordnance Workers of the former Yellow River Northern Yang, as well as employees of the Jinpu and Longhai Railways and the working masses. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Council received a report from the Hebei-Shandong Yellow River Supervision Office stating that the Yellow River upstream has recently experienced a surge, with the flow rate increasing from Wangyi (one thousand) cubic meters per second to 7,800 cubic meters per second, which will soon reach the Shandong border. The water flow in the lower reaches is becoming increasingly turbulent. In addition to ordering all river bureaus to strictly prevent floods, inspectors have been sent to inspect the area. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) A responsible person from the Department of Construction said that the flow rate of the Middle Canal at Yaowan has reached 700 cubic meters per second, and the situation is precarious. If Weishan Lake can stop rising, there is still hope for the future. Otherwise, Jiangsu Province, located in the lower reaches, is virtually indefensible. Jiangsu's flood prevention efforts this time are based on a consistent policy of directing the water flow back into the channel so that it can quickly flow into the sea. Rumors of obstructing the water flow and unsuccessful embankment construction are all based on a lack of understanding of the true situation. However, the only way to prevent Weishan Lake from rising is to block the breach. Therefore, blocking the breach of the Yellow River itself is of utmost importance. Shen Baixian went to Xuzhou on the night of the 27th to inspect the situation. Weishan Lake continued to rise by 4 centimeters on the 28th, reaching 36.597 meters, exceeding the major water level of the 15th year of the Republic, but still 2 meters below the breach at Houjialin Panlongji in Shandong Province in the 3rd year of Xianfeng. If the breach is not blocked, a flood in northern Jiangsu is inevitable. The water in Fengxian County is still rising, and officials and civilians are working hard to protect the area. The water in various sections of the Weiji embankment in Pei County has risen slightly, while the water situation in Tongshan and Pi County is still stable. The water level in Liutang of the Middle Canal is stable and not yet dangerous, but precautions are being taken. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Shen Baixian Arrives in Xuzhou to Inspect the Water Situation; Shao Hanyuan Returns to Xuzhou After Inspecting the Embankment</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Construction, and engineer Lin Baoyuan arrived in Xuzhou this morning by the Shanghai-Beiping train. Shao Hanyuan rushed back from Bianliang and, along with local party and government leaders and members of the Flood Prevention Association, greeted them at the station. A public banquet was held at a food store. During the banquet, Shen delivered a speech, stating that he was dispatched by Chairman Chen on behalf of the provincial government with two missions: first, to comfort the leaders from all walks of life and the local people for their hard work in building embankments to prevent floods; and second, to inspect the water situation in northern Jiangsu, urge Shandong Province to block the breach, and facilitate the drainage of water in Jiangsu Province. He also said that the three counties of Tongshan, Fengxian, and Pei County, with the local people's strength and a spirit of hard work, have made great efforts to block the Yellow River, which is commendable. Jiangsu has already contributed 100,000 yuan to Shandong to help block the breach. The drainage flow of the Middle Canal has reached 700 cubic meters, exceeding the standard of 500 cubic meters stipulated by the Economic Commission. In the future, the Central Government should be asked to quickly block the breach to alleviate the flood. After the banquet, Shao Hanyuan, Wang Gongyu, Dai Zhiqiang, Su Qiliu, and others accompanied Shen to inspect the Bulao River water situation in Maocun. Secretary Wu, sent by the Supervisory Envoy's Office, also went along. They returned to Xuzhou in the evening. Shen is scheduled to go to Fengxian and Pei County for inspection tomorrow morning. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shao Hanyuan, who had previously gone from northern Tongshan to Pei County to inspect the embankments, returned to Xuzhou today. He said that the current condition of the embankments is safe and the people are guarding them very strictly, regarding the embankments as the place where their lives and property are entrusted. The rate of water flow increase has slowed down slightly. Currently, the water inundating the embankments on the lakefront is up to 3 meters high in the highest places and about 2 meters in the lowest places. If the water does not surge again, the entire embankment should be safe. Wang Gongyu, who inspected the lower reaches of the Jing River yesterday, returned to Xuzhou and said that the water in the Jing Mountain Bridge has risen sharply, and the northern end of the bridge is submerged in water, cutting off traffic on the bridge. According to water level calculations, it is equal to the water level in 1915. Based on this, the water situation in northern Jiangsu is slightly stable in the west, while it is surging in the east. The Middle Canal will become increasingly strained. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>The Huai River Conservancy is Building Two More Water Barriers in Pi County; Shandong People Strongly Oppose</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Huai River Conservancy and the people of Pi County are continuing to build two water barriers between Wangmu and Shengyang Mountains in Pi County to prevent the water from flowing south. They are also throwing stone materials and sacks into the Grand Canal in an attempt to block the river. Millions of people in southern Shandong are extremely indignant and are poised to take risks. The Magistrate of Yixian County telegraphed Han Fuqu, requesting him to telegraph the Central Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government Huai River Conservancy to stop the construction to avoid causing incidents. Due to the rising water of the Yellow River and the obstruction of water in Jiangsu Province, the water level has risen sharply in the disaster areas of northwestern Shandong. More than a hundred villages have been flooded again in Juye, and the city has been flooded by the sluice gates, with many collapses. The total loss for the county is 25 million yuan. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Kai, Chief Engineer of the Huai River Conservancy, said that the water level of Weishan Lake has reached 38.8 meters due to the impact of the Yellow River's rising water, and if it rises another inch, the Middle Canal will definitely overflow, and the disaster in northern Jiangsu will be unimaginable. He is scheduled to go to the Middle Canal on the morning of the 30th to inspect the waterway and inspect the dangerous works of the ship locks and cofferdams of the Huai River Conservancy.

<h3>The New President of the South Manchuria Railway, Matsuoka, Takes Office</h3>
<p>— A Commentary</p>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke, the newly appointed president of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), recently departed from Tokyo to take office in Shenyang. Before leaving, he announced his reform plans, stating that the main tasks of the SMR are: (1) to construct the Cangshi Railway from Cangzhou Station on the Jinpu Line to Zhangjiakou Station on the Pinghan Line, creating an economic route for Japan in North China and promoting the success of Japan's continental policy; and (2) to actively reorganize the SMR to achieve functional unification and strengthening, while also expanding the existing Economic Research Council and East Asia Section to engage in the investigation of resources in North China. These two tasks are of great importance to the future of our country. I would like to briefly express my views on the nature of the SMR and the significance of the change of its president, for the benefit of my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>(1) The establishment of the SMR was the beginning of Japan's management of Manchuria and the initial step in the implementation of its continental policy. The nature of this organization is almost identical to that of the East India Company when the British first managed India, and its efforts in managing railways, ports, coal mines, iron manufacturing, electricity, and other industries even surpass it. It cannot be said that the unfortunate situation in our Northeast today is not due to the blessings of the SMR.</p>
<p>(2) Since last year, the SMR has been brewing a reorganization to adapt to the new situation. The debate between "three-in-one" and "one-in-one" within Japan was quite intense for a time. As a result, the Kwantung Army won the final victory. The so-called Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Manchuria is now concurrently held by the Commander of the Kwantung Army. The position of President of the SMR should also be filled by a trusted figure of the Kwantung Army. The newly appointed President Matsuoka has deep ties with the military. He served as Vice President and Director of the SMR for many years. He is intelligent, versatile, and adept. He also has a reputation in diplomatic circles. The recently proposed Mongolia-Manchuria railway plan was drafted by him. Now that Matsuoka has been ordered to take on this important task, he will surely expand his long-held ambitions. The future development of the SMR is indeed noteworthy.</p>
<p>(3) Currently, the focus of Japan's policy towards China is in North China, and the main goal of the SMR's work in the future is also in North China. After Matsuoka takes office, the cooperation between the Kwantung Army and the SMR will become closer. Their active entry into North China is also expected. According to the Dongbao, Japan has established the principle of developing North China with the SMR as the center. The specific plans are: (1) In Tianjin, gather authorities from all aspects to establish a large Sino-Japanese-Manchurian research institution to assume the role of a general staff headquarters for the economic development of North China and make it a guiding institution; (2) Japanese capital will mainly be invested through the SMR, based on the guidance of the economic general staff headquarters. The SMR has decided to issue 120 million yuan in corporate bonds within this year to fund the construction of new railways. Although, on the one hand, Japanese capitalists are wary of investing in the SMR because it goes beyond the scope of purely economic benefits and lacks solid guarantees, and on the other hand, Matsuoka's relationships with the financial and monetary circles are weak, raising funds is not easy. However, once this plan is realized, Japan's economic power in North China will be even more unshakeable.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we can see that the significance of Matsuoka's assumption of the presidency of the SMR this time cannot be ignored. As the saying goes, "Remembering the past is a guide for the future." Should the people of our country be vigilant about the past history of the SMR and its future development plans?</p>

<h3>Denying Violation of Agreement: Soviet Union Responds to US Protest, Washington Dissatisfied, Staff Reduction at Embassy in Russia</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russia has today responded to the strong protest from the United States regarding the various resolutions and speeches of the Third International Congress, denying that Soviet Russia has violated the agreement. The reply stated, "None of the matters described in the letter can be regarded as Soviet Russia having violated its obligations. The United States has probably long known that Soviet Russia cannot and has never assumed all the responsibilities of the Third International." (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull immediately held a meeting with State Department officials Moore and Kelly II after receiving the Soviet reply. However, they indicated that they would issue a statement only after a detailed study of the reply. It is understood that the reply will first be sent to President Roosevelt for his personal approval before any action is taken. It is generally believed that the State Department is very dissatisfied with the Soviet reply. Officials have stated that the US finds the Soviet declaration that it is not responsible for all activities of the Third International unsatisfactory, as Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov guaranteed in Section 4 of his letter to President Roosevelt on November 16, 1933, that Soviet Russia would not "permit the formation or residence in its territory of any organization or group, and would prevent any group or organization, or its personnel, from having the purpose of overthrowing or preparing to overthrow any part of the United States or its territory." (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The US Embassy in Russia has today been ordered to reduce its staff by half, making it one of the smallest American embassies abroad. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to news from Washington, the staff of the US Embassy here will be reduced for the second time this year. Except for the Ambassador himself and a few attendants, the rest will leave Moscow within this week. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Pittsburgh, USA: Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters on his way home today that if Soviet Russia does not guarantee that the Third International will abandon its activities of organizing communism in the United States, the US Ambassador to Russia will inevitably be recalled. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government protested to the Soviet government because the Third International made resolutions concerning US domestic affairs at its recent conference in Moscow. Subsequently, Soviet Ambassador to the US Troyanovsky gave an oral response, and the Soviet government refused to make any concessions. Secretary of State Hull recently met with President Roosevelt to discuss the matter. According to well-informed sources, the US government is unlikely to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet government, and the possible actions it can take are no more than the following three: (1) Allow the embassy in Russia to continue to exist, but recall Ambassador Bullitt to Russia on "leave"; (2) The scope of US-Soviet diplomacy is reduced to a very small extent, merely to maintain appearances; (3) Propose another protest to the Soviet government, detailing US dissatisfaction with communist propaganda. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Contents of Soviet Reply</h3>
<p>(Moscow) US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, submitted a protest letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Krestinsky, stating that the Communist International held its Seventh Congress in Moscow, and that the Soviet government… duty not to interfere in American internal affairs, etc.</p>
<p>Krestinsky today handed the reply to Bullitt, stating, "We must solemnly declare that the Soviet government has always observed its obligations in the past and present with the utmost respect. The mutual non-interference obligations exchanged between the United States and the Soviet Union in the letters of November 16, 1933, and after detailed negotiations between President Roosevelt and Litvinov, are absolutely no exception. None of the facts mentioned in Your Excellency's note of August 25 provide any evidence that the Soviet government has violated its obligations. On the contrary, the US government should know that the Soviet government cannot and has never assumed any obligations to the Communist International. Therefore, Your Excellency's statement that the Soviet government has violated the obligations stipulated in its note of November 16, 1933, does not refer to the obligations that both parties have ever assumed. Therefore, I cannot accept Your Excellency's protest and can only reject it.</p>
<p>The Soviet government sincerely agrees with the US government's statement that it will never interfere in internal affairs, as a major prerequisite for maintaining friendly relations between the two countries. At the same time, the Soviet government is implementing this policy and is striving to continue to develop Soviet-American friendship and cooperation, because this cooperation is in the interests of the people of both the Soviet Union and the United States, and is of great significance to world peace."

<h3>Japan Will Follow in the Footsteps of Britain and the United States, Giving Verbal Warning to Russia</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The speeches at the Seventh Congress of the Third International in Moscow contain many matters that interfere in the internal affairs of capitalist countries and promote communist propaganda. It is reported that the United States, Britain, Latvia, and others have also protested. The Foreign Ministry will soon invite Ambassador Yurenev or Ravik to verbally warn the Foreign Minister that the Communist Party, which is practically integrated with Moscow, is exploiting Japanese and Russians to slander Japan's East Asian policy and carry out official communist propaganda, which violates Article 5 of the Japanese-Russian Treaty prohibiting communist propaganda. Therefore, it will seek Soviet self-reflection. As the Japanese side wants to achieve practical results, it does not seem to be using formal protests that might provoke Japanese-Russian relations, but only verbal warnings.

<h3>Third International Congress Condemns Japan's Policy Toward China, According to Japanese Newspaper</h3>
<p>The Japanese Foreign Press reports that the resolutions of the Seventh Congress of the Third International, which have been conveyed to the United States and Japan, have aroused anger in the governments of both countries, especially towards Japan's advance into China, which has been subjected to extreme slander. They have issued fierce instructions, and the International Secretariat of the Anti-Imperialist League and the National Independence League has issued instructions to its branches in various countries and the organizations under their command. The attacks on the Japanese Consulate General in New York and the Singapore Club are all based on the above instructions to carry out anti-Japanese demonstrations. (Shanghai Japanese Daily)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Meeting Approaching: France Decides Position, Adhering to the Stresa Agreement, Opposing Sanctions Against Italy, Sending a Powerful Delegation to Geneva to Prevent War</h3>
<p>(Paris) This morning, during a special meeting of the French Cabinet, Premier and Foreign Minister Laval made a clear statement on France's position regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, stating that France opposes sanctions against Italy, maintains friendly relations with Britain and Italy, and adheres to the Stresa Agreement. Laval's declaration focused on the latest status of the dispute, especially the recent talks in Paris between the three parties, and expressed satisfaction with the Italian government's intention to present Italy's reasons at the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on September 4. However, as Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's decision to resolve the matter with Abyssinia by force is clearly unwavering, Laval also explained the seriousness of the situation. Laval went on to mention the visit of British Ambassador to Paris, Sir Eric Phipps, yesterday, stating that there is no denying that Britain's attitude towards upholding the League of Nations Covenant has not changed. Phipps stated that British public opinion is willing to support the government. Laval did not say that diplomatic contacts between London, Paris, and Rome would continue, but the situation would not change before the League of Nations Executive Council meets on September 4 to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. The Cabinet decided that the French delegation to attend the meeting would be composed of Laval, Minister without Portfolio Herriot, former Foreign Minister Pongou, former Finance Minister Bonnet, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Peranx, and Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Bastite. The Cabinet decided that the delegation would have complete freedom of action, first to avert the war between Italy and Abyssinia, second to do its utmost to prevent Italy from withdrawing from the League of Nations, and third to limit the scope of the Italo-Abyssinian war. It is expected that British Minister without Portfolio Eden will meet with Laval in Paris on his way to Geneva. The French are paying great attention to this meeting between the two officials.

<h3>Italy Indicates It Does Not Want to Break Ties with League of Nations, Actively Pursuing Three-Pronged Approach, Will Declare Respect for British Interests</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italy is actively pursuing a three-pronged approach today: on one hand, it continues to send troops to East Africa; on the other hand, it is preparing to detail Abyssinia's crimes before the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on September 4; and on the other hand, it is demonstrating its large-scale military strength on the Austrian border. However, according to official sources, reports of Italian naval movements in the Mediterranean are completely exaggerated. Only three ships, sailing from Naples to East Africa, carrying 1,416 soldiers, are confirmed. At the same time, the Foreign Office here has instructed its representatives in Geneva to present evidence that Abyssinia is not fit to be a member of the League of Nations. Observers predict that this action by Italy may indicate Mussolini's desire not to sever relations with the League of Nations. Today, Mussolini, wearing a uniform, personally drove a tank in the vanguard during the Pusano maneuvers, accompanied by one British and one French observer. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Italian Military Maneuvers, Decisive Battle Ends, Attacking Force Retreats, Defending Force Counterattacks, Italian King Supervises Battle from Front Line</h3>

<h3>Abyssinian King's Strategy for Dealing with Italian Military Action: Wait for Large-Scale Offensive Before Severing Diplomatic Relations and Declaring War</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegram's correspondent in the Abyssinian capital declares that Italy intends to occupy Abyssinia by force, and considers the initial military action to be a purely police action. The Abyssinian Emperor has already decided on a method of dealing with this strategy. If Italy gradually advances towards the border with a small number of troops, the Abyssinian army will only drive out the enemy troops. Conversely, if Italy launches a large-scale offensive, Abyssinia will sever diplomatic relations with Italy and officially declare war. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia's Financial Situation is Serious: Ban on Private Export of Silver, Various Countries Protest Suspension of Foreign Currency Payments</h3>

The French railway authorities have not received a penny despite the protest from the French embassy. The general financial situation is very serious, and an order to stop cash payments will be issued soon. The Emperor and his advisors discussed the financial problems all night, and finally decided to no longer maintain the exchange rate of the Abyssinian currency, but have now taken measures to prohibit the private export of silver. The luggage of most foreigners leaving the country yesterday was strictly inspected before departure. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>Abyssinian Capital: Thousands of Abyssinians obeyed the King's orders and fled to the countryside to prepare shelters in the event of Italian air raids after the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian war. When enemy planes arrive, three cannon shots will be fired, church bells will be rung, and sirens will sound to warn people to leave their homes and scatter as much as possible to open spaces, such as the Abyssinian King's racecourse or the wide plains outside the town. Since the Abyssinian Bank stopped selling foreign exchange, imports have completely stopped at customs. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3>American Congressional Achievements: Passing Legislation Vital to Both Domestic and Foreign Affairs; Roosevelt Still Hopeful for Next Year's Presidential Election</h3>
<p>(Washington) The 74th session of the United States Congress adjourned on [date], its term the longest in history. President Roosevelt was determined to have each of his key "New Deal" bills debated and passed by Congress. The legislation passed during this congressional session is of great importance, both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>Regarding Foreign Affairs: In terms of foreign policy, although President Roosevelt supported the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, the Senate voted against it in February of this year. The Senate's intention was to reaffirm America's resolve not to interfere in European politics. Some senators even wanted to pass legislation to establish American neutrality in wartime, but this failed because President Roosevelt preferred to keep the neutrality issue unresolved for the time being. Only an amendment was passed, advocating for a U.S. arms embargo against belligerent nations, effective until the end of February next year. Additionally, Congress passed the so-called "Boileau-Reynolds Act," which established a Federal Munitions Control Board to regulate arms dealers and manufacturers, and approved the 1925 Geneva Convention on International Arms Trade. These are the major pieces of foreign policy legislation passed by Congress.</p>
<p>Regarding Domestic Affairs: As for domestic affairs, the work of Congress during this session can be divided into two periods. The first five months after Congress convened were the first period. During this time, the policies outlined by Roosevelt in his speech last summer were turned into laws, aiming to alleviate the economic panic and improve social conditions. The most important legislation included allocating $4.8 billion to establish a relief fund for unemployment and public works, extending the life of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation by two years, creating the Social Security Act to establish a social insurance system, and the Wagner Act to strengthen labor union rights. Unexpectedly, during this period, the Supreme Court ruled the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) unconstitutional. This cast doubt on the validity of all legislation passed since President Roosevelt took office. The period from that point until the adjournment of Congress was the second period. At this point, President Roosevelt had to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling, amend the NIRA, and extend its validity for ten months. Subsequently, Congress passed various bills with nationalistic tendencies, aiming to control the economy and currency. These included the Banking Act, expanding the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), the Wheeler-Rayburn Act to curb private company control of public utilities, and the Guffey Coal Act to regulate the coal industry. Later, in early July, President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress requesting the passage of a tax bill to levy special taxes on the wealthy with large incomes. It was generally believed that the President's message was a means of countering Senator Huey Long, who was advocating a policy of wealth redistribution to sway public opinion in preparation for a presidential run next year. Therefore, Roosevelt advocated for taxing the wealthy as a way to nip the plan in the bud. Moreover, the above-mentioned legislation was radical in nature and inevitably faced fierce opposition from business capitalists. The resulting turmoil led Congress to establish a special investigative committee to investigate private companies funding congressional members to oppose government bills, eventually exposing old malpractices.</p>
<p>In summary, President Roosevelt achieved much of what he desired during this congressional session. When the United States elects its next president in November of next year, Roosevelt will have this large body of legislation to defend his record to the voters. From a constitutional perspective, the power of the central government has greatly increased during this congressional session, while the autonomy of the states has been reduced. This is another noteworthy phenomenon. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Objective observers stated today that silver bloc members will face the greatest obstacle in the next session from the opposition of the House majority leader, as they largely follow the government's intentions. However, the silver bloc in the Senate, with the support of the agricultural bloc, is likely to be more powerful in the next Congress. Therefore, there is much speculation about the possibility of a joint silver-agricultural bloc pushing for monetary reform. If the two blocs can unite, their success will depend on whether the House silver bloc can overcome procedural obstacles. At the close of this congressional session, several silver-related plans remained unresolved, including: (1) The McCarran Silver Seigniorage Act, which the Senate had passed, but remained pending in the House; (2) The Thomas Amendment, which required the Treasury to actively purchase silver until the price rose to $1.29 per ounce, and then freely buy and sell to stabilize the silver price; (3) Pittman's investigation into the impact of government silver purchase policy on commodity prices and international trade; (4) A subcommittee recommended by the Agriculture Committee, led by Thomas, to investigate the Treasury's implementation of the silver purchase plan. Thomas told the Associated Press today that his investigation would begin by consulting with foreign diplomatic representatives stationed in Washington to gather opinions from global experts on monetary issues and to seek answers from experts on gold standard, bimetallism, and managed currency. Additionally, bankers, economists, and monetary experts from various countries will also be directly consulted to obtain assistance from domestic and international sources.

Of this, the Navy's budget is $438,000,000, an increase of $173,000,000 over the previous year, and the Army's budget is $368,000,000, an increase of $97,000,000 over the previous year.

<h3>Austrian Interior Minister Seriously Injured in Car Accident: Repeatedly Distinguished Himself in the European War</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Interior Minister Fey, one of the founders of the Austrian Heimwehr (fascist party), was seriously injured today in a car accident. Fey is 59 years old and served in the Austrian army during the European War, repeatedly distinguishing himself in battle. He was seriously wounded four times, leaving deep scars on his face, and his jawbone is prosthetic. In October 1932, he joined the Dollfuss cabinet as Security Minister, and in September of the following year, he was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister. When the Socialists and the government engaged in civil war in February 1934, Fey led troops to storm the Socialist strongholds. In July of the same year, the Nazis staged a rebellion, and Fey and Prime Minister Dollfuss were held captive for several hours in the Prime Minister's office. He became the Minister of Interior after the new cabinet was formed. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Austria Establish Agreement: Agreeing that Newspapers of Both Countries Cease Reciprocal Attacks</h3>
<p>(Berlin) It is reported that the German and Austrian governments have reached an agreement stipulating that newspapers in both countries cease attacking each other. Previously, German Ambassador to Austria von Papen expressed dissatisfaction to the Austrian Foreign Ministry regarding the Austrian newspapers' denigration of Germany. The Austrian government retorted, saying that German newspapers were denigrating Austria in the same manner. Subsequently, after several conversations between Papen and Austrian Foreign Minister Guido Schmidt, both sides agreed to improve the tone of their respective newspapers in order to restore friendly relations between the two countries. Diplomatic circles here are very concerned about this move, believing that it is a precursor to the restoration of normal relations between Germany and Austria. It is also believed that Papen recently returned to Berlin, and his negotiations with the Austrian government to conclude the agreement were the result of instructions from the government in Berlin. In addition, some believe that Germany will base its new policies towards Austria on the development of Italy's colonial policy in East Africa. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance issued a circular to the unified tax bureaus in various districts, stating that since the provinces of Gansu and Ningxia have successively implemented the unified cigarette tax, cigarettes sold to Gansu and Ningxia from unified tax zones should pay the unified tax in full, affix sufficient stamps, and use unified tax transit permits before shipment. No further taxes should be levied upon arrival in those provinces. However, as cigarettes transported to Gansu and Ningxia from unified tax zones were previously exempt from tax and were subject to transit tax levied by customs, the transit tax should be suspended for all cigarettes that have paid the unified tax and are being sold to Gansu and Ningxia. The Customs Service has been ordered to notify all customs offices to comply with this. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Xuzhou Circles are Rushing to Build the Third Line of Flood Defense. Villages North of Lanjiaba are Completely Submerged. The Roadbed of Maocun Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is Immersed in Water.</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After the dike on the west side of Weishan Lake at Lanjiaba and the people's embankment on the Yan River collapsed in the Tongbei flood, the first line of flood defense in Tongbei was abandoned immediately, and the second line of defense was quickly arranged to block the overflowing water. At the same time, the third line of defense was being built to protect the city. However, the disaster in the Tongbei area is already very serious. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway runs directly through Tongbei, and the Jing River runs horizontally through it, so the roadbed has also been flooded. For the time being, there is no major problem, but if the breach in western Shandong is not plugged one day, the Yellow River's water will continue to come one day, the disaster area in Tongbei will inevitably expand, and traffic on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will also have problems. Now, the actual situation of the local area and transportation being flooded is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Water Attacks the Second Line of Defense</p>
<p>The dike on the west side of Weishan Lake at the Lanjiaba breach was washed away for 60 meters. The Yan River embankment was submerged and breached in two places. The water rushed straight down from the Lanjiaba breach, partly flooding westward, passing through Zhaicheng, and partly flowing eastward, flooding the Jing River. After Commissioner Shao Hanyuan personally inspected the situation, he decided with County Magistrate Wang Gongyu to abandon Lanjiaba and quickly set up the second line of defense, building a horizontal embankment eastward from Pipa Mountain to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway roadbed to prevent the Jing River from flooding southward, and building a ring dike southwestward from Qiduan, passing through Mapo, Zhengji, Taoyuan Bridge, and Liuxinzhuang to Chedaokou, to restrain the westward flooding water. This is the second entire line of flood defense in Tongbei. Unexpectedly, the Yellow River's water came with increasing force. When the second line of defense was being built, the water was already approaching the base of the dike. Now, these two new dikes have been completed, and the water has reached half of the dike. Fortunately, the rise in water level has slowed down slightly in recent days, the westward flooding water has decreased, and the eastward flooding water has increased, so the horizontal dike and ring dike have not been in danger. The old Yellow River dike, the third line of flood defense, is also being built jointly by the stationed army. The Second Division's engineering corps is building Chedaokou, and the tax police corps' engineering corps is building the old Yellow River dike. All have been completed to date.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Disaster in Tongbei</p>
<p>Before the Yellow River's water entered Tongbei, the people of Tongbei were busy building dikes to prevent flooding, and the sacrifice of farmland and manpower had already been considerable. After the water arrived, the villages north of Lanjiaba were completely submerged. When the west dike collapsed, the civilians who were rushing to plug the breach were cut off by the water, and they could not take care of each other. The supervisors rescued them from danger with civilian boats. There were also many material losses. The floodwater flooded and attacked the second line of defense, and the villages became a watery land. County Magistrate Wang Gongyu of Tongxian was supervising the construction of the dike from the beginning. Now that the dikes have been completed, he has returned to the city. According to Wang's personal observation in the disaster area, the Anmin and Yuelai townships in the Second District, the Baduan, Suizhao, Wanglou, Yongyi, Magou, Danlou, Shalou, and Shuanglou townships in the Third District, the Zhacheng, Sanshan, and Renli townships in the Fifth District, the Yongxing, Jingqiao, Jiahe, Tunhe, and Anhua townships in the Sixth District, and the Lushan, Xinghe, and Biantang townships in the Ninth District, a total of 21 townships, each with an estimated population of 10,000, should have about 200,000 disaster victims. As for the tragic situation of the flooding, some are on the roofs of houses, some are squatting on the treetops, with gaunt faces and emaciated bodies, crying for food. Preventing the Yellow River from flooding is certainly a problem, but disaster relief cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Flood Prevention and Relief Work</p>
<p>The Xuzhou Chamber of Commerce established a flood prevention committee when the Yellow River disaster first broke out. During the critical period, a temporary committee for supervision and material supply was organized. Now that the rumors of the Yellow River changing its course are very strong, the committee believes that the key is whether the breach in western Shandong can be plugged or not. Now, it is sending telegrams to various counties in western Shandong to jointly carry out the work of plugging the breach, and at the same time, it is uniting with people from Huaiyin and Donghai counties to strongly request the central government to plug the breach, prepare civilians, and strictly guard the dikes, determined to share life and death, and not allow the Yellow River to change its course and cause disaster to Jiangsu. Recently, local people have also established a Yellow River Disaster Relief Association, presided over by Lan Weibin, provincial party committee member, to carry out investigation, fundraising, and relief work. Party, government, and community personnel have already set off in two groups today to conduct on-the-spot investigations in the disaster area and start fundraising at the same time. After the investigation is completed and the fundraising is effective, emergency relief work will begin.</p>
<p>The Roadbed of Maocun is Immersed in Water</p>
<p>Maocun Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is located 25 li north of Tongbei, with the Yan River (the upstream of the Jing River) and the Daishan River running horizontally through it. This time, the Yellow River's water flowed down from Lanjiaba and came east along the Yan River. The upstream of the Daishan River is connected to the Yan River, passing through the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to the east, and still returning to the Yan River. Therefore, where it passes through the roadbed, it becomes two river shapes. The water in these two rivers is shallow and small in flow, and it overflows due to the irrigation from the upstream. The water in the two rivers is connected, and the water level has immersed the roadbed. Zhu Xianbing, the engineer stationed in Xuzhou for this road, goes north every day to inspect and guide the workers to pile up huge stones on both sides of the roadbed to protect against the impact of the water and waves. Three trains are transported from Fuliji to Maocun every day for supply. Wu Yiming, director of the engineering department of the railway bureau, was also sent to Xuzhou to inspect northward. Wu went to Jinan in the north and inspected Maocun and Hanzhuang along the way. He has now returned south. According to his talk, traffic is not likely to be in danger for the time being. Zhu said that the terrain of Hanzhuang is higher than that of Maocun, so the water in Maocun is particularly large. The Yan River Bridge is 600 feet long, the Daishan River Bridge is 400 feet long, and the Canal Bridge is only 150 feet long. The flow rate is also higher in Maocun, but it is not as high as the flow rate at Lanjiaba. However, if the local area dredges the Jing River, the bridges on this road will have problems. There is a lack of good measures to deal with this kind of unexpected disaster. According to the situation in Maocun, the flood is very widespread. Four kilometers of the roadbed are in the water. It can be seen from the top of Zifang Mountain at Xuzhou Station. Many people go to the mountain to watch the water every day.</p>
<p>Building a Horizontal Embankment on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway</p>
<p>East of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, due to the flooding of the Jing River, there is deep concern that the water will spread. There is already the Pipa Mountain dike west of the road to prevent the southward flooding of the water. East of the road, there is still a gap. Therefore, the local area is adding a horizontal dike east of the road, south of the Jing River, to reach the south of Jing Mountain Bridge. Workers from the Tianjin-Lanzhou and Longhai Railways are all participating. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway is assisting with 700 cubic feet of stone, and the Longhai Railway is assisting with 1,000 cubic feet of stone. It can be successfully completed within days.</p>
<p>Commissioner Inspects Embankments</p>
<p>Because the dikes in Tongbei have been completed, but the water level continues to rise, Shao Hanyuan set off from Tong on the 26th with engineer Yu Shufang to inspect the new dikes at Chedaokou, Pipa Mountain, and Qiduan, directing the raising and thickening of the dikes and supervising the dike guards. He spent the night in Qiduan and went to Fengpei this morning to inspect the west dike. It was found that except for the breach at the southern end of the west dike, the remaining sections were still standing firmly to block the water. Now, the entire area east of the west dike, the ring dike, and the horizontal dike is under water, while the area west of the dike has not been affected. Therefore, the people west of the dike regard the dike as the only barrier to protect their lives and property and are defending it with all their might. It is not true that no one is rushing to protect the dike when it collapses.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Sijing Public Office Runs a Free Clinic</h3>
<p>The Sijing District Public Office, as a customary practice, holds free clinics between summer and autumn to benefit the poor and sick. This year, the public office is still holding the clinic as usual, and from the end of July, it has invited 17 doctors specializing in internal medicine, external medicine, acupuncture, pediatrics, ophthalmology, and trauma to set up a clinic in the public office to provide diagnosis. The number of people from far and near who come to seek medical treatment is endless. At the same time, various local charitable households have attached medicine. From the opening of the clinic to the end of the diagnosis, the number of people who have received medical treatment is approximately 1,550. The medicines provided by various charitable households also totaled more than 200 yuan. The local people are endlessly grateful for the enthusiastic relief of the doctors and the charitable acts of the benefactors.</p>
<h3>Another Robbery Case in Tinglin New Street</h3>
<p>Ma Xiaodi, head of household number 12, Jia of Bao 4, Xiang of Tinglin New Street, at around 1 a.m. on the 24th night, was suddenly visited by more than ten local-accented bandits who entered through the kitchen door and window. They tied up the victim and looted freely. Because the bandits were all carrying pistols, wooden sticks, and flashlights, etc., the victim's shoulder was injured. The bandits carried the stolen goods out the front door and escaped, with a loss of several hundred yuan. The case has been reported to the bureau for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Highway Traffic Opens, Wheel Industry Panics</h3>
<p>Since the Suzhou-Changzhou Highway was opened to automobile traffic, the Suzhou-Mudu Highway will also be officially opened to traffic within days. The fare for the Suzhou-Changzhou Road was originally 7 jiao 8 fen (now it has been changed to 7 jiao), and the fare for the Suzhou-Mudu Road is set at 3 jiao. Therefore, various inland river shipping companies operating on these two routes are in a state of great panic. To compete for business, they have all automatically lowered prices. The Suzhou-Changzhou line is now 2 jiao, and the Suzhou-Mudu line is only 5 fen, which has already been implemented. However, because the Construction Department has not yet issued a business license for the Suzhou-Mudu Road, the company has submitted a request to the department to expedite the issuance. It is expected that it will be issued in two or three days.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Appeal for Collecting Business Tax on Wheat</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of dental shops collecting temporary wheat business tax from merchants, the Business Tax Bureau previously sent a letter to the Rice, Bean, Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association and various flour mills, ordering them to immediately comply with the order to collect the tax. Later, the Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry and the Province, stating that most of the wheat in Wuxi is used as raw material for flour, and the flour is subject to a unified tax, so it cannot be subject to business tax again, asking for the abolition of the system. Later, an order was received from the Ministry stating that the business tax collected from merchants has nothing to do with the unified tax, and ordering the grain stores to be notified to promptly comply. The Business Tax Bureau also strictly ordered the grain stores and the wheat offices in Wuxi of various Shanghai flour mills to quickly register the number of wheat they have handled and report it to the bureau for verification and tax collection. However, the grain stores believe that the rice industry has already paid business tax. If they are ordered to collect wheat tax from merchants again, there will be many difficulties in practice. Therefore, all eight Duan leaders gathered at the Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning (the 28th) to resolve to explain the situation to the bureau and continue to appeal.</p>
<h3>Early Autumn Silkworms Have Already Undergone Their Third Molt</h3>
<p>This year's autumn mulberry trees in the county are very delicate, unprecedented in past years, and silk prices are soaring, so more people are raising autumn silkworms than in previous years, hoping to reap high profits. Now, the early autumn silkworms have already undergone their third molt and are opening their leaves, while the late silkworms are only undergoing their first molt and opening their leaves. The price of leaves is 1.5 to 1.8 yuan per load, and the future price is expected to rise further. The crops in the fields are still good at present. If there are no wind or insect pests, there will definitely be a bumper harvest in the future.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: A Big Fire by the River Destroys Seventeen Homes</h3>
<p>After the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road and the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan Highway were established at Xiaoshan Riverside, its market has revived, and merchants have gathered. At dawn on the 25th of this month, Zheng Amao and Shao Qinran's house suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. Because the neighbors were all asleep, by the time they were awakened, the fire had already spread and could not be extinguished. Although people tried to put out the fire, it was too late. Seventeen thatched houses nearby and the Ninth Police Station were all reduced to ashes.</p>
<h3>Nantong: A Young Girl Dies Tragically After a Tooth Extraction, An Autopsy is Performed</h3>
<p>Liu Jinding, a young girl from Liuqiao, was quite pretty, but her canine teeth were exposed, which she regretted. So she went to the town's hospital to request surgery. Two doctors, Zeng Bingrong and Sun Keming, performed the surgery and used pliers to remove the tooth. The girl fainted and died on the spot. The girl's father was very sad and reported the case to the court. At noon on the 27th, Inspector Wang performed an autopsy, and Zeng Bingrong and Sun Keming were taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Official Letter: Letter from the Secretariat of the Control Yuan</h3>
<p>To the editor: On August 17, your newspaper published a case of impeachment by this Yuan against Ruan Kaiji, chief of the Xinzha Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, for accepting bribes and selling cases. After investigating the full text, the following words were omitted after "Inspector Tan instructed the report of the case's progress to the General Bureau, and the branch chief": "also did not comply. The Wu Baoming case had already been prosecuted in court and belonged to the judicial scope, and the branch chief". Also, regarding the case of embezzling allowance to enrich his own pockets, Wang Ayun and four other names were reported within the branch's allowance list, and were found to not exist, the following words were omitted after "the branch chief": "also admitted that there was one false name, and the suspicion of embezzling the allowance was inevitable. According to the above explanation, the branch chief". The case concerns impeachment texts, and slight discrepancies would be incongruent with the original meaning. We are therefore writing this letter for your review and to add the corrections. Respectfully, Secretariat of the Control Yuan, August 26.</p>

<h3>The Navigation Industry on the Sichuan River Suddenly Improves, Chinese and Foreign Shipping Companies Compete Fiercely, Japanese Ships Resume Chongqing Service</h3>
<p>The navigation industry on the Sichuan River has been depressed for many years, causing the Jiejiang Company to close down due to operating losses. Recently, since the exchange rate has been stabilized, business on this route has suddenly improved, and Japanese ships have also resumed service. There is a large backlog of outgoing goods, and a detailed description of the recent situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Smooth Transport of Outgoing Goods</p>
<p>After the dissolution of the seven-company alliance on the Sichuan River route, all Sichuan merchants stopped shipping goods due to the high exchange rate, and business plummeted. In addition to drastically lowering fares to compete for the transport of outgoing goods, various shipping companies were at a loss, and as a result, they suffered losses. The American company Jie Ting even closed down in this trend. However, since the Central Army entered Sichuan and achieved a great victory in suppressing bandits, and the Central Bank established branches in Sichuan to stabilize the financial situation in Sichuan, the exchange rate has fallen sharply, and the market has improved. The people of Sichuan have been able to live and work in peace, and Sichuan merchants have rushed to Chongqing to ship goods, and the transport of outgoing goods has suddenly become crowded. The navigation industry has suddenly improved, and the speed of the transformation in recent months has been beyond human expectation.</p>
<p>Revival of Shipping</p>
<p>The reasons for the revival of the navigation industry on the Sichuan River route are the stabilization of finances in Sichuan and the restoration of the purchasing power of the people. Sichuan merchants in Shanghai have transported large quantities of cotton yarn, foreign goods, etc. to Chongqing. Currently, among the merchant ships sailing on the Sichuan River, the Minsheng Company has taken the lead since Jiejiang closed down and Zhaoshang gave up. It is followed by foreign shipping companies such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson. The demand for cargo transport upstream exceeds the supply. The Minsheng Company's Chongqing-bound ships are not enough to load, so they have increased the number of ships. At the same time, they have also notified various customs brokers that all cargo transported to Chongqing must be booked two weeks in advance, otherwise it will not be loaded onto the ship. Minsheng is like this, and Taikoo and Jardine Matheson are also like this.</p>
<p>Soaring Fares</p>
<p>After the dissolution of the alliance, the companies on the Sichuan route lowered prices to an extreme. Later, they gradually increased. The freight rate for each ton of upstream cargo rose to 24 yuan. In recent months, the rapid increase in goods entering Sichuan has led to crowding, and the shipping companies have taken the opportunity to increase the freight rate for outgoing goods to Chongqing. The fare per ton, which was at least 24 yuan, has now increased to 44 yuan, an increase of more than 80% compared to the original price, and there is still the possibility of further price increases.</p>
<p>New Ships Open</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company purchased the Yiping, the first of the Sanjiang ships from Jiejiang. It has been successfully renovated and renamed Wanliu, and is sailing upstream to Chongqing today. The ship side set the sailing date a few days ago, and various shippers went to the Taikoo Company to compete to load cargo. The company authorities were unable to cope, and at that time, they moved the riverside cylinder (抛河筒), and refused outright. Because there was more cargo than ships, it was difficult to allocate the space. It was already full yesterday, and the cargo that could not be loaded even exceeded the amount loaded by more than double. From that, one can see one aspect of development. The second ship will also be completed soon. According to Manager Yang, the ship name has been changed to Kangding, and it will soon open to meet the needs of shippers.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Open</p>
<p>The Nisshin Company had several ships on the Sichuan River route, such as the Yunyang Maru, Guanyang Maru, and Deyang Maru. After the January 28th Incident, they stopped sailing for several years. The Changjiang and Hunan lines of the company had resumed early, but the Sichuan line had not been restored until now. Now, because Japanese goods are selling well again, and there is a need for ships to transport cargo from Shanghai to Sichuan, the company is taking this opportunity to repair the newest Yunyang Maru and put it back into service. It is also convening crew members and sailors to restore the Chongqing route starting in September. As soon as the cargo is crowded, another ship will be added. After this ship opens, the routes of the Japanese ships upstream and downstream of the Yangtze River will be fully restored.</p>
<p>Sanbei Development</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company is the most powerful of our civilian airlines. It already has two ships, Fuhua and Fuyang, sailing on the Sichuan River. It has now decided to expand the Sichuan River fleet and is in the process of purchasing a certain ship, which will be dedicated to the Chongqing route. The negotiations are about to be completed and can be successful soon.</p>

<p>Organizational Meeting Decides on Measures</p>
<p>The first temporary meeting of the Investigation and Relief Group of the association was held at Renji Hall at 5:00 PM on the 26th. Li Dachao, Quan Shaowu, Xu Shiying, Zhao Henghong, Huang Bo, Tang Zhuxin, Huang Qinglan, Wang Jiaoliu, and Qian Qing attended. Advisor Baker and Chairman Wen Lanting presided over the meeting. After the usual formalities, the chairman reported on the group's affairs. A number of important cases were then discussed and resolved. Excerpts are recorded and supplemented as follows: (1) Regarding the proposal submitted by the first joint meeting of standing directors and supervisors on how to conduct the investigation and relief efforts for this session, it was decided to nominate Wen Lanting, Cheng Jingsheng, and Quan Shaowu to draft a plan, and Chairman Wen will convene a continued meeting on August 28 to discuss and decide on it. At 5:00 PM yesterday, the group convened its second temporary meeting. The attendees included Director Wen Lanting, Deputy Directors Cheng Jingsheng, Qu Wenliu, and Huang Hanzhi, Chief Secretary Huang Bodu, Deputy Chief Secretary Quan Shaowu, and Advisor Baker. Chairman Wen Lanting presided over the meeting. After the chairman officially read the draft outline of the investigation and relief implementation plan, it was immediately revised and passed in its entirety. After the group reviewed the original text of the Ten Commandments for Investigation and Relief drafted by Deputy Director Cheng, it was decided to file it for implementation. The meeting adjourned at 7:40 PM.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Emergency Relief Implementation Outline</p>
<p>The original text of the Emergency Relief Implementation Outline is excerpted as follows: (1) The association's emergency relief is for saving lives, not for general relief. (2) The association's emergency relief methods will follow the usual relief procedures, taking into account the joint planning and division of labor of the disaster relief organizations in various provinces this year. The division of responsibilities is as follows: (A) The flood relief general associations organized by the provincial governments, party departments, public groups, charitable organizations, and local impartial gentry are entrusted by the association to manage the relief funds allocated and are responsible for distributing relief tickets to disaster victims according to the association's specifications (in provinces without a relief general association, the provincial relief affairs association will handle it on its behalf). (B) The association will set up an investigation and relief officer in each province, responsible for surveying and identifying disaster areas, investigating disaster households, and issuing the association's relief tickets. (C) Disaster-stricken counties should set up flood relief sub-associations, which will be responsible for managing and distributing the association's relief funds in each county under the association's mandate. (D) Provincial investigation and relief officers should appoint gentry with a reputation for relief work in disaster-stricken counties as directors of investigation and relief, and separately appoint experienced investigators to be directly responsible for surveying disaster areas, investigating households, and providing food or shelters. (E) In disaster areas that need to manage shelters or porridge distribution, the county director of investigation and relief should appoint personnel to manage them, and the county sub-association of the relief association should select accountants to distribute expenses from the association's relief funds. (3) Standards for allocating relief funds: (A) The association allocates relief funds on a provincial basis, based on the severity of the disaster, and determines the amount of relief to be distributed, paying particular attention to prioritizing the most severely affected areas. After the meeting has decided on the amount of funds to be allocated, the provincial investigation and relief officers will consult with the relief general association to determine the scope of the relief area based on the amount of relief funds issued by the association to the province. If there is little disaster relief money, and the disaster is widespread throughout the province, it is better to focus on one county, or even just one or two townships in one county, in order to save those who can be saved. If they cannot be saved, so be it. If they are saved, they must be kept alive. They must not be grandiose and waste relief funds. The association is responsible for selecting provinces, the provincial investigation and relief officers are responsible for selecting counties, the directors of investigation and relief are responsible for selecting areas and townships, and the investigation and relief officers are responsible for selecting households and people. The standards for selection are as follows: (A) For an allocation of 20,000 yuan, only the most severely affected two townships in the most severely affected county can be provided with relief. For 50,000 yuan or less, only the most severely affected two or three townships in two or three of the most severely affected counties can be provided with relief. (B) Each adult should receive at least the equivalent of one yuan in national currency, and each child should receive the equivalent of 50 cents. (4) Investigation and relief officers should be selected from one of the following qualifications: (A) The director of the relief group of the disaster relief general association of the province. (B) Local impartial gentry who have handled relief work for more than five years and have a high reputation, and are genuinely known and vouched for by at least two standing directors and supervisors of the association. (C) Leaders of charitable organizations and religious organizations who have personally investigated and distributed relief for more than five years, are publicly recognized for their appropriate relief efforts, are well-known, and are genuinely known and vouched for by at least two standing directors and supervisors of the association. (5) Inspection and supervision: In addition to requesting the supervisory commissioners of the relevant provinces to send personnel to inspect the relief efforts, the association will set up an inspection director in each province and appoint inspectors to supervise and urge progress. The qualifications for the inspection director are the same as the two types of qualifications for the investigation and relief officers in paragraphs (B) and (C). (6) This emergency relief should be based on cash distribution. If the local area needs relief grain, it should also be purchased locally and should not be transported from afar without reason. (7) The procedures and regulations for investigation, distribution, and reimbursement, as well as the regulations for inspection personnel, will be formulated separately with reference to the regulations of the Drought Relief Association.</p>
<p>Cheng Jingsheng Drafts the Ten Commandments for Investigation and Relief</p>
<p>Cheng Jingsheng, Deputy Director of the Investigation and Relief Group of the association, personally drafted the original text of the Ten Commandments for Investigation and Relief as follows: (1) Beware of appointing replacements, leading to a reversal of priorities and wasting relief funds. (3) Beware of being afraid of difficulties and seeking peace, requesting local authorities and villagers to investigate households on their behalf, even if there are no malpractices, it is difficult to avoid favoritism. (2) Beware of bending to the private opinions of local figures, resulting in inappropriate investigation of priorities. (4) Beware of accepting food, drink, and all supplies from local figures. (5) Beware of acting impulsively, refusing to humbly seek detailed information about the disaster victims' plight. (6) Beware of being soft-hearted, recognizing minor disasters as extreme poverty, and issuing relief tickets indiscriminately. (7) Beware of perfunctory performance, hastily completing tasks. (8) Beware of arbitrarily delaying and prolonging deadlines. (9) Beware of disharmony among colleagues, hindering progress. (10) Beware of general investigation and general distribution, making it difficult to achieve thorough relief.</p>

<h3>Fundraising for Relief: Customs May Impose Additional Taxes; Fu Rulin Once Discussed with Finance Minister Kong</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the beginning of summer, rivers have caused disasters, and disaster victims are waiting for relief. The central government has already allocated funds for relief. According to the Central News Agency reporter's investigation from relevant parties, in addition to the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways providing considerable assistance, the Ministry of Finance may order customs authorities to impose a surcharge on import duties to raise large sums for relief. As for the amount of the tax rate, the date of commencement, and the duration of collection, they are still being secretly deliberated. Regarding this matter, it is said that Fu Rulin, chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, once discussed it with Finance Minister Kong.</p>
<h3>Using Relief as a Pretext to Collect Money: Social Bureau Issues Strict Prohibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued a proclamation yesterday strictly prohibiting the collection of money under the false pretense of relief. The proclamation stated, "It is essential to raise funds for relief in this year's natural disasters. However, while there are many who are concerned about disaster victims and enthusiastically help with relief efforts, there are also not a few who use the name of relief to seek personal gain. It is hereby urgently proclaimed that henceforth, in addition to those who directly donate funds for relief, who should comply with the Shanghai Municipal Government's instructions to unify fundraising methods and directly submit them to the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, anyone holding any gatherings to raise funds for relief must submit detailed methods and income and expenditure budgets to this bureau for approval before they can be held. The relief funds obtained must be handed over to the Fundraising Committee for Flood Relief in Various Provinces on the same day, and the income and expenditure must be published in the newspaper to prevent abuses. Do not disobey! This proclamation is of utmost importance!"</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Mortgage Lending: Various Banks and Firms Have Begun Processing</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee began processing 5 million yuan in small credit loans on August 1, the number of applicants for loans has been very crowded. More than 20 cases have been approved for loans by the committee. As for the 15 million yuan in mortgage loans, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Finance and the detailed rules for loans, banks and money shops are to issue the loans themselves. Currently, industrial and commercial circles are eagerly awaiting the early realization of this mortgage loan due to the impending end of the ninth month (of the lunar calendar). It is reported that several banks have already started processing this mortgage loan, and have sent personnel to the loan committee to inquire about the review procedures. The committee has answered them one by one and requested that they be handled in accordance with Articles 9 and 10 of the detailed rules for loans. It is said that for this mortgage loan, the applicant must apply directly to the bank or money shop. After the bank or money shop investigates and deems it appropriate to grant the loan, it will submit a copy of the borrower's application and balance sheet and profit and loss statement to the loan committee for review in accordance with the regulations. Once the committee approves it, it will immediately notify the various banks and money shops to issue the loan and issue a national treasury certificate as a second guarantee for the loan. The procedure is very simple.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Loan Group's Transportation and Sales Loan Method; Shaanxi Province Loan of 700,000 Yuan; Entrusts Banking Group to Handle Transportation and Sales on its Behalf</h3>
<p>Since the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Banking Group began piloting cotton and wheat production loans for the spring and autumn seasons in Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces this spring, the results have been quite good. After returning to Shanghai from an inspection tour some time ago, Director Zou Bingwen convened a meeting of directors, approved the regulations for continuing to pilot the transportation and sales loan, and decided to adopt the principle of acting as an agent for the transportation and sales of new cotton. The area is still limited to the four provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Hebei. The loan amount was determined to be 700,000 yuan due to the large area of cotton fields in Shaanxi Province. The remaining three provinces will be allocated according to their needs at the time, and the amount has not yet been determined. It is rumored that the autumn loan is set at 3 million yuan, which is likely a misunderstanding. The transportation and sales loan is scheduled to be issued in two installments starting from September 10. After the new cotton is harvested in October, the transportation and sales cooperative will entrust the banking group to handle all procedures for transportation and sales. The cooperative will act as an intermediary for management and facilitate transactions.</p>
<h3>Cross-Border Road Construction and Telephone Price Increase Issues: Municipal Government Pays Close Attention</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the issue of increasing telephone prices by the Shanghai Telephone Company in the cross-border road construction sections, the municipal government believes that it concerns sovereignty and has explained to the company through the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities that it should wait for the approval of the municipal government before implementing it. The two sides once held formal negotiations, but there were no results. However, the municipal government is paying close attention to this matter and is determined not to allow the telephone company to increase telephone prices in the above-mentioned sections without authorization. It is now looking for new ways and adopting effective measures to deal with this matter. However, the details of the measures have not yet been officially announced.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Donated Merchants Implementing Cake Tax Collection</h3>
<p>Oil Mills in Various Places Request Correction; Emergency Meeting to be Held Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to Dagong She, Guangdong donated merchants recently proposed collecting an additional construction fee for Sun Yat-sen University on soybean cake and wheat bran. For all types of cakes shipped from Tianjin, Yantai, Shanghai, and the Yangtze River ports, the fee will be 25 cents per dan (unit of weight). The various organizations, including the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Association, the Oil Mill Association, the Guangdong Shanghai Native Place Association, the Guangzhao Guild Hall, and the Chaozhou Native Place Association, have telegraphed the Guangdong Party and government authorities one after another, urging them to stop it. The Oil Mill Association sent telegrams to manufacturers in Hankou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Kunshan, and other places, requesting each to send representatives to Shanghai to jointly formulate policies. The representatives of manufacturers in Wuxi, Changzhou, and Kunshan have already arrived. The Hankou Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association has also replied by telegram, stating that the harsh collection in Guangdong and Shantou concerns the survival of manufacturers and that they are sending representatives to Shanghai to jointly formulate actions. Before their arrival, all documents and telegrams issued will be jointly signed. The manufacturers in Shanghai have repeatedly consulted with representatives from various places and have expressed their determination to fight to the end. According to the latest news from Guangdong, this cake tax will be levied starting from September 1. Therefore, manufacturers have jointly convened an emergency meeting with various merchant guilds and decided to stop work and transportation immediately and telegraphed manufacturers in Hankou to express their consistent position with Guangdong and Shantou.</p>
<p>Telegram to Zou Haibin, Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University President Zou Junjian: Guangdong province donated merchants recently proposed that no matter where the bran is shipped from, they would collect an additional fee of 25 cents per dan for your school, which concerns the cultivation of education. If the merchants have sufficient financial resources, who would not be happy to fulfill their obligations? However, domestic oil mills are still in their infancy, facing extremely depressed industries and being exhausted by the vigorous competition from imported materials. Manufacturers are struggling to survive and rely on the support of the authorities. We respectfully recall that in May of last year, donated merchants pointed out that bran products were produced in Shandong province and levied heavy taxes. After being presented to your esteemed seat, you sent a frugal telegram stating that the collection of additional fees on soybean cakes and wheat bran should only apply to products from the three northeastern provinces and not to those produced by scholars, ordering the merchants to abide by the record. The words of benevolence have benefited the people and are still praised to this day. Now, a year has passed, and farmers and merchants are even more distressed. If the meeting of donated merchants is put into practice, there will be no distinction between domestic and imported goods, and the tax barriers will be removed. The market will see imported goods being dumped, and the lifeline of domestic manufacturers will be severed. Your esteemed seat's original intention to protect domestic products will not be fully realized. Our association and other colleagues are terrified and anxiously report to you. We are extremely apprehensive and earnestly telegraph to request your esteemed seat to maintain your original intention and preside over the correction. We are filled with deep sadness. Shanghai Miscellaneous Oil Cake Industry Association, Shanghai Oil Mill Industry Association, Hankou Miscellaneous Grain Oil Cake Business Association, Wuxi Oil Mill Industry Association, Wujin Oil Mill Industry Association respectfully bow. Frugal,</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Meeting: Various local oil mill associations, miscellaneous grain industry associations, and other organizations, in response to the Guangdong provincial donated merchants' collection of an additional fee on bran, which is scheduled to take effect on September 1, have convened an emergency meeting to discuss specific response measures. The notice states: "We are writing to inform you that we have scheduled to discuss the issue of the Guangdong provincial donated merchants' collection of an additional fee on bran at 3:00 PM on August 30 in the meeting hall on the second floor of this association. We hope you will attend and participate in the discussion and plan everything. This is what we desire. Sincerely, and it is also determined that at 7:00 PM on the same afternoon, Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, and others will host the press at a Yizhi Xiang restaurant on Four Horse Road to report on the illegality of the Guangdong donated merchants' collection of bran donations.</p>
<h3>Wu Xingya Discusses Labor Literacy Education</h3>
<p>Can Reduce Disputes and Increase Production Efficiency; Factory Costs are Limited and Benefits are Significant</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: Mr. Wu Xingya, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, considering the urgent need for factories to establish literacy schools as scheduled, in order to promote labor education, especially made the following remarks to visiting reporters yesterday. In recent centuries, the education undertaking of various countries has a characteristic, that is, attention to popular labor education. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, with the development of new-style industries, major changes have occurred in the economic sphere, resulting in various labor-capital problems in society. These problems are deeply related to politics, economics, society, and the labor-capital parties themselves, and the fundamental solution lies in the promotion of labor education. Based on my humble opinion, the promotion of labor education will at least help solve the following problems: 1. The problem of labor-capital disputes. Labor-capital disputes have been a common occurrence in various places in China and abroad in recent years. Although labor-capital disputes in this city have subsided slightly recently, they still occur from time to time. The reasons for this include excessive oppression of labor by capital in terms of treatment, which arouses resistance from labor and leads to labor-capital disputes. There are also cases where workers have shallow knowledge and are easily emotionally agitated, leading to blind obedience and affiliation, causing great losses to capital and disputes arising as a result. If these workers are given appropriate education to gradually understand the meaning of work and production, as well as the mutual interests of both labor and capital, they can feel the need for cooperation between labor and capital and eliminate labor-capital disputes in an invisible manner. This is how labor education helps solve the problem of labor-capital disputes. 2. The problem of production efficiency. In terms of industry, the level of production efficiency is most important to capital. However, to improve production efficiency, workers must have sophisticated work skills, advanced methods, and the rational use of labor and production materials. All of the above must rely on the power of labor education to train them. The power of education generates interest in work, and the interest in work inevitably increases work efficiency. This is how labor education helps increase production efficiency. 3. The problem of improving workers' lives. The current state of workers' lives must be improved, which is generally recognized. The methods of improvement depend on the increase of work treatment and the restriction of work hours, but the promotion of labor education cannot be ignored. "Education is life," as said by the famous American educator John Dewey. From this, we can know that education is a tool for improving life, and labor education is a tool for improving the lives of workers. This is how labor education helps improve workers' lives. The above is still the general and ordinary meaning and need for labor education. Because our country, in economic terms, is a country with backward production, in cultural terms, is a country filled with illiteracy, and in political terms, the success of the national revolution must be based on the awareness of the peasant and worker masses. Therefore, if our country wants to improve its economic, cultural, and political status, and the success of the national revolution, and the revival of the entire nation, labor education has a considerable mission. Based on the above, labor education is so important, so the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Education promulgated the General Outline of Implementation Measures for Labor Education in the 21st year of the Republic. This city also has regulations on the detailed rules for the implementation of the General Outline of Implementation Measures for Labor Education. Unfortunately, most factories in this city have failed to earnestly abide by and implement them, resulting in no visible results. Recently, in order to eliminate illiteracy in the city and improve the cultural level, this city has organized literacy education. The Bureau, considering that there are as many as 700,000 workers in the city, accounting for one-fifth of the city's population, most of whom are illiterate, for the benefit of both labor and capital, and for the benefit of society, these workers must receive the same literacy education as the general public. Therefore, the Bureau previously formulated the Shanghai Municipal Labor Literacy Education Implementation Measures, which were passed by the Municipal Literacy Education Association and submitted to the Municipal Government for promulgation. After the promulgation of this method, various rules and forms were formulated, and the Municipal Literacy Education Association and the Bureau dispatched personnel to various factories to persuade them to establish labor literacy schools by the end of this month. Now that the deadline is approaching, many factories have indeed established schools as scheduled, but many still have a wait-and-see attitude and hope to delay. This attitude is particularly incorrect. Many factories use economic constraints as an excuse, but in fact, it only costs more than ten yuan to set up a labor school class. This trivial amount is by no means unaffordable for the factory, and the benefits it receives are several times its cost. It is hoped that the factory authorities can earnestly appreciate the above-mentioned meaning and need for labor education, not have a wait-and-see attitude, and immediately set up labor literacy schools in the factory, and be sure to eliminate illiterate workers in the factory within one year, then the benefits and results obtained in the future will be by no means shallow.</p>

<h3>Xinhua An Damaged Shaft; Vessel Dispatched for Rescue</h3>
<p>The Chang'an Shipping Company of this port has recently been reorganized into the New Chang'an Shipping Company. The Xinhua An vessel has always sailed on the Shanghai to Fuzhou route, and then extended its route to include Qingdao, Shanghai, and Fuzhou. This time, the vessel loaded hundreds of tons of raw peanuts and peanut oil in Qingdao after arriving in Qingdao. It left Qingdao at 6 pm on the 27th and sailed directly to Shanghai. It could have entered the port this morning, but unexpectedly, the vessel suddenly reported engine damage in the middle of the voyage, and the hull could not be steered.</p>
<p>Lost Shaft</p>
<p>The Xinhua An vessel arrived at 122 degrees and three minutes east longitude and 33 degrees north latitude yesterday, which is near the Tongsha ocean area. The shaft on the ship suddenly reported damage, and the hull could not move. At that time, the shipowner immediately ordered the anchor to be dropped and telegraphed the Shanghai company for a report, requesting a quick solution and sending a ship to tow it, so as to avoid the danger of being abandoned at sea. The company received the report and immediately proceeded with the towing procedures.</p>
<p>Ship Dispatched for Towing</p>
<p>The New Chang'an Company notified the China Ship Insurance Joint Association of this matter. At the same time, the Ship Insurance Joint Association contacted the British firm Laisi Foreign Company in this port to send a tugboat, along with technicians and workers, to the Tongsha ocean area to tow the Xinhua An vessel to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. After the Xinhua An arrives in Shanghai, the damaged shaft must be installed before it can go to Fuzhou again.</p>
<h3>New Desheng Vessel Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Yihuo Foreign Company's New Desheng vessel arrived in Shanghai at around 9 pm last night, but it must first go to Qingdao and then to Shanghai on September 6. The company will then invite people from all walks of life to visit the vessel. It will then open its maiden voyage to Shantou, Hong Kong and Guangzhou on the 7th. It is reported that the prices of tickets for all classes on the vessel are particularly low.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Relief Association; Pei County Branch Requests Additional Relief Funds; Western Chairman Has Departed</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road, in view of the recent Yellow River flood, which has spread to Jiangsu Province, and the area around Xuzhou, which is at risk of breaching the dikes, especially the severely affected Pei County, has specially sent the Western Chairman, Father Jin Jiaju, to inspect the area in person, so that he can return to the association to report and decide on the relief policy. The telegram from the Pei County branch is attached below: The telegram said: "We previously received relief funds of 5,200 yuan, and we were ordered to investigate and distribute them. Later, due to the Yellow River breach in Linpu, the water situation was vast in the areas of Juye, Yuncheng, Jining, and Yutai. In order to prevent floods, this county rushed to build a large dike to prevent the Yellow River. Hungry people from all over the area should be requisitioned to build the dike. Once the investigation and distribution are carried out, it is feared that accidents will occur, so it has been delayed. Now, the water from Zhaoyang and Weishan Lakes is squeezed out by the Yellow River and spills outwards, spreading more than ten miles, and dozens of villages along the lake are submerged. Although the water has stopped rising in recent days, the disaster has already occurred, and the disaster area has expanded. This small amount of money is no different from a drop in the bucket, and it is feared that it will be difficult to provide relief. In addition to continuing to report the details, we hereby telegram to request your association to allocate additional relief funds to help the victims. We are extremely grateful."</p>

<h3>Jin Yu Securities Firm Embezzlement of Treasury Bond Case; First Special Court Ruled Yesterday; Gan Denglai Sentenced to One Year in Prison</h3>
<p>Gan Denglai, a partner of Jin Yu Securities Firm in Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, fabricated account names to conduct securities trading and lost more than 28,000 yuan. Unable to make up for the losses, he took the opportunity to steal a large amount of customs duty treasury bonds from the firm and fled on the 29th of last month. He was later captured by the police, and most of the stolen goods were recovered and sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the date for sentencing arrived. Gan was still escorted to the court by the police, and Wei Yuansheng, who was also involved, also came to the court on his own. Judge Feng Shide then took the seat and announced the verdict: Gan Denglai was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for embezzling the property of others held in the course of business, and four months of imprisonment for continuous breach of trust, to be served concurrently for one year and two months. He was also ordered to compensate Gan Yunqiao for 1,000 yuan of customs duty treasury bonds from the 23rd year of the Republic of China, totaling 4,372.85 yuan. Wei Yuansheng was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Captures Another Embezzlement and Fraud Offender</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese Daily News, in November of last year, a businessman named Minowa Ichiro, who runs a fire extinguisher business, came to Shanghai to expand sales and stayed at the Hinode Hotel on Wusong Road. Through the introduction of a Mr. from a weights and measures shop on Xihuade Road, he displayed ten fire extinguishers at the shop. Later, Mr. said that he had found a large Chinese customer and asked him to send 1,800 fire extinguishers immediately, stating that the price was 6,200 yuan. Minowa was overjoyed and sent an order to Japan. Unexpectedly, Mr. suddenly made excuses, saying that the Chinese customer had broken the agreement. After repeated negotiations, there was no result, causing Minowa to lose 448 yuan in storage fees and transportation costs for six days at the dock. At this time, Mr. again said, "I have a privately run warehouse. Since there are no customers at the moment, why not store them in my place first?" Minowa believed him and moved the extinguishers to Mr.'s place. He then returned to Japan for a while. On February 1st, he came to Shanghai because he had found a Western customer who stated that a sales contract could be established on March 10th. He asked Mr. to return all the fire extinguishers. Mr. claimed that they could not be released from the warehouse until the end of March. When the deadline arrived, Mr. made more excuses. Minowa suspected his actions and began to investigate. He learned that the warehouse Mr. had referred to as his own was originally the Qingshui Disinfection Institute on Daisiwei Road. Mr. mortgaged Minowa's goods to the institute and borrowed 440 yuan. At this point, the truth was revealed. He reported the matter to the police station of the Consulate General. The Japanese Consulate, considering that Mr. had formally established a large-scale shop on Xihuade Road and dared to embezzle and defraud, ordered Police Inspector Sato and others to strictly investigate the truth of the case. It was also heard that Mr. had previously used the same fraudulent means to obtain property.</p>
<h3>Dr. Qiu Rengao is Sued by His Nephews and Nieces for 50,000 Yuan; The Case is Complex and Involves Matters Between Men and Women; Even the Plaintiff Stuttered When Describing the Case</h3>
<p>Qiu Rengao, a Western-style doctor who runs a clinic in the Jicheng Pharmacy at the Nanjing Road Bowling Alley, is 42 years old this year and lives at No. 76 Yu Garden Village, Yu Garden Road, West Shanghai. His ancestral home is Shangyu, Zhejiang. His ancestor fled to Shanghai during the Hongyang Rebellion and settled there. Some say that his ancestor's surname was originally Wang, and some say it was Xie, but Rengao's surname is Qiu because his father became the adopted son-in-law of the Qiu family. Therefore, his cousin Qingyuan still has the surname Xie. Qingyuan had three sons, the eldest Xien, the second Huien, and the youngest Qiaoen, and three daughters, Enmei, Enjuan, and Enxin, all born to his first wife.</p>
<p>Later, he was widowed</p>
<p>He then remarried a Miss's daughter as his successor. Because she was favored by Qingyuan, the property was entirely under her control, and the children could not get their hands on it. Rengao and this woman were related as uncle and sister-in-law, but they did not avoid suspicion and were more intimate than usual. When Qingyuan passed away, Rengao lived with the woman. Although Xien and his younger siblings disapproved of the behavior of their stepmother and uncle, they remembered the words of Zhongchou and could not speak out. They all kept it a secret. Last summer, they realized that their father had died and their mother was ill. All the property was only known to their mother and uncle. They were deeply worried that if something unexpected happened to their stepmother, it might</p>
<p>Vanish into thin air</p>
<p>Therefore, they questioned their uncle at their mother's sickbed. Rengao then wrote a note acknowledging保管 [bao guan] = safekeeping/custody of 50,000 yuan of property, stating that the money would be repaid in installments over five years. Not long after, Xien's stepmother passed away. Xien then took the note to Rengao to demand the money, but after negotiations, he received nothing. Xien and his younger siblings then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Qiu Rengao in the First Special District Local Court to recover 50,000 yuan of inheritance. Yesterday morning, Judge Mo Runhua of the First Special Court held a hearing.</p>
<p>Six Plaintiffs</p>
<p>Only Xie Xien, Huien, and Qiaoen, three brothers, arrived. The other three daughters were all minors and had not filed a case. The three plaintiffs who arrived pushed Xien to speak. Judge Mo then ordered him to state the facts of the lawsuit. However, because the content of the case mostly involved the ambiguous actions of his uncle Rengao and his deceased stepmother, revealing the truth in court would be detrimental to both parties' faces. If he kept it a secret, the case would be difficult to clarify. Considering this in many ways, he</p>
<p>Stuttered</p>
<p>Making it even more difficult for the court to understand. His lawyer then stood up to speak on his behalf, but omitted the private matters involving men and women. He only stated that the lawsuit was based on the note personally written by the defendant. The reason was that in June of last year, the plaintiff's stepmother was lying in bed at the Dahua Hospital, knowing that she would not recover. She summoned the plaintiff's six children to her bedside and said with tears, "All the property accumulated by your father is with your fourth uncle (i.e., the defendant)." The defendant was also present at the time. When he heard the plaintiff's stepmother's words, he was displeased and said to her, "You</p>
<p>Calm down and recuperate</p>
<p>Don't dwell on this matter." The plaintiffs knew the relationship between their mother and the defendant and questioned the defendant. The defendant then invited Xien to his home and gave him a note for 50,000 yuan. Xien asked the defendant why the note only stated 50,000 yuan when his father's inheritance was more than 100,000 yuan. The defendant admitted that the remaining assets had been spent by him. A few days after the note was written, the plaintiff's mother died. They asked the defendant for payment, but he repeatedly avoided them. Unexpectedly, in June of this year, he suddenly claimed that the note was written under coercion,</p>
<p>Hoping to quibble</p>
<p>Therefore, the plaintiffs had to file a lawsuit. During the hearing, Qiu Rengao, the defendant, was summoned to the case. He was given the note to read and questioned about the facts of the case. Qiu's attitude was smooth, and his answers were ambiguous. He said that he could not confirm whether the note was originally written by him. He also claimed that the note originally written by him was written under duress by Xie Xien, who suddenly came to the upstairs of his sixth brother's house at No. 51 Bai'erbu Road at midnight on July 1st of last year and forced him to write it with a gun. At that time, he originally intended to report it to the police, but he was afraid that Xien would be subject to criminal punishment, so he only rushed to Dahua Hospital to inform his mother. Later, after his mother died, he invited his third brother to Xien's house to negotiate. In front of his third brother, he</p>
<p>Tore up the note</p>
<p>He also published a statement in the newspaper last winter, thinking that the matter was over. He also presented a letter from Qiu Chunfu as evidence. However, when the plaintiff Xie Xien heard Qiu's statement, he shook his head repeatedly. He then stated that No. 51 Bai'erbu Road, where the note was written, was where the defendant and his mother lived together. Initially, he did not want to say anything because the matter involved their ambiguity. The note was also voluntarily written by the defendant, and he had never had a gun, so how could he have used violence and coercion? Finally, the lawyers from both sides debated each other. Judge Mo said that he still needed to summon witnesses and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Moving the Major Bandit Xie Wu Requires Evidence</h3>
<p>Xie Wu (also known as Xie Feipeng and Susheng), a major bandit from Shuyang, Jiangbei, fled to Shanghai because the situation was urgent and he could not stay any longer. The Zhenjiang Garrison Command received a secret report that the bandit Xie was hiding at No. 70 Tan's Residence, west of Xinqiao Road, Nanshi, in the Chinese area of this port. It sent Cai Zhaofeng, director of the special task force, along with special agents Shao Shike and Shao Hanzhang, and He Yutang, a detective from the first district of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Security Team, to Shanghai to assist the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau in sending detectives to arrest him at the address. However, the bandit Xie was well-informed and had already moved to avoid capture. After investigation, it was learned that Xie had moved to No. 310 Laffeide Road in the French Concession. They reported to the French police station at 5 PM the day before yesterday and requested detectives Lu Zhulin and Bao Tan Liu Jinrong to go and arrest Xie and take him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Special Court. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu and Clerk Zheng Rong sat in the Criminal Division to interrogate him. Yuan Jiahuang, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the facts of the case and said that the Zhenjiang Garrison Command had not provided any evidence of the defendant's crime. The Police Department could not agree to the request for extradition and asked the court to decide. Then, a representative from the Zhenjiang Garrison Command stated the situation of the defendant's arrest warrant for crimes committed in Donghai County and requested that the defendant be extradited. When Xie Pengfei was questioned, he denied being a robber. The court verified the testimony and ordered a later investigation and verification. The defendant was temporarily detained. The representative was notified to submit the evidence to the court as soon as possible for verification and decision.</p>
<h3>Hua Feng Flour Mill: Arrest and Interrogation of Workers Involved in Incident; Western Police Inspector Recovering and Will Be Re-Interrogated</h3>
<p>After the Hua Feng Flour Mill on Xiao Shadu Road ceased operations in March of this year, all factory workers demanded severance pay, leading to a dispute between labor and management. The Social Bureau mediated, ordering the factory to pay each worker one month's salary as severance. However, the workers insisted on three months' wages, and the issue remained unresolved. Unexpectedly, on the 24th of this month, a group of approximately two hundred male and female workers went to the residence of Ye Shantao, the factory's director, at No. 47 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, to stage a sit-in, intending to exert pressure. Ye reported this to the Zhabei Police Station, which dispatched officers to advise them to leave, but to no avail. As the workers remained there on the 26th, Ye, unable to bear the disruption, again requested assistance from the police station. Western Police Inspector Mike Wylon and Detective Zhang Yuanjing led several detectives to Ye's residence to persuade the workers to leave. At that point, workers Lu Zhengchao from Yangzhou, Liu Mingwu from Hubei, and Liu Shiyou from Jiangbei shouted, "Beat the cops!" The crowd echoed the call and rushed forward, assaulting Inspector Mike Wylon with fists and kicks. Mike sustained facial injuries, his leather belt was torn, and his cigarette case was crushed. Detectives intervened and managed to quell the disturbance, arresting the three ringleaders: the two Lius and Lu. During the attempted escape, Liu Mingwu fell and was injured. All three were taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Second Criminal Division. Police Attorney Zhang Shizhu explained the situation and charged them with obstructing official duties under Article 153 of the criminal law. Due to Liu Mingwu's injuries, he was receiving treatment at the hospital, so a request was made to postpone his interrogation. Inspector Mike and others then testified about the incident. When questioned, the defendants denied the charges. Judge Ye Shengchao reviewed the statements and ordered the defendants to be held in custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>### Woman Commits Suicide by Poison After Failing to Purchase Leather Shoes</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiaosong, a 30-year-old man from Jintai residing at No. 11 Deyu Lane, Lloyds Road, worked as a cook at the Xin Xin Zhai noodle shop on Xinjiabang Road. His income was meager, leading to an extremely impoverished life. The day before, Zhou received three yuan in wages from the shop and brought it home to pay the rent. However, his wife, Wang (22 years old), wanted to use the money to buy leather shoes. Zhou refused, leading to a quarrel between the couple. Subsequently, Wang became extremely resentful and contemplated ending her life. The next morning, around 7 a.m., after Zhou left for work, Wang secretly swallowed a large amount of opium and committed suicide. She was discovered by her neighbor, Yu Ren Wu Maotou, who immediately went out to inform Wang's relatives and then had her transported to the Huili Hospital on Avenue Edward VII for treatment, but it was in vain. She soon died, and the hospital reported the incident to the Zhabei Police Station. Detective Lang Chengpei was dispatched to investigate. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Filon Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Tang and others to examine the body. After questioning Zhou Xiaosong, the deceased's husband, and others, Tang concluded that the deceased, Zhou Wang, was a female who died from opium poisoning. The body was released to her husband, Zhou Xiaosong, to be prepared for burial.</p>
<h3>### Real Estate Developers Consider a New Idea: Proposal to Establish a Real Estate Exchange</h3>
<p>Due to the economic downturn, real estate prices in the city have plummeted compared to previous years. In the spring of this year, real estate developers organized a Commercial Economic Association and planned to issue 50 million yuan in circulating notes to facilitate the trading of these massive real estate assets. After several studies, the plan was shelved due to inadequate measures. More recently, they proposed to establish a real estate exchange to transform illiquid assets into liquid assets to facilitate the circulation of capital. The real estate industry believes that if the real estate exchange can be established, it will be the best way to increase real estate prices. Therefore, they have sent representatives to Beijing to petition the relevant authorities for approval to establish the exchange and alleviate the decline of the real estate market.</p>
<h3>### Shanghai Dredging Bureau Forecasts Continuous High Tides in the Huangpu River for the Next Four Days Starting This Morning; Calm Winds Will Prevent Exceeding Records</h3>
<p>According to the tide forecast from the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, starting at 10:28 a.m. today (i.e., August 1st of the lunar calendar), there will be continuous high tides for the next four days. However, due to calm winds, the records will not be exceeded. The forecast figures are as follows: 29th (today) morning (no accurate forecast) 11.5 feet; 30th morning 12:14 a.m. 11 feet 4.5 inches; 31st morning 12:36 a.m. 11 feet 4.5 inches; September 1st morning 1:05 a.m. 11.5 feet. The above records are lower than those issued during the month, so low-lying areas and warehouses in Shanghai will not be affected. This information is provided for the reference of navigators.</p>
<h3>### Pudong Telephone Line Repaired; Service Restored Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has reconnected the trunk line to the Pudong branch, which was interrupted due to the recent heavy thunderstorm. Therefore, telephone service between Shanghai and Pudong was temporarily disrupted. After the line was broken, the Bureau sent personnel to actively repair the damage. Yesterday, according to Mr. Yu Bingjian, the chief engineer of the Bureau, told the East China News Agency reporter that after rushing to repair it, it was restored late the day before yesterday, and normal communication was restored after 0:00 yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Tianchu Flavor Essence Co., Ltd., in order to strengthen its financial position and expand its business, has reorganized from an unlimited company into a limited company and increased its capital by 200,000 yuan, bringing the total to 2.2 million yuan. All preparatory procedures have been completed. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., the inaugural meeting was held at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Xizang Road. 88 shareholders attended, including Wu Yun Chu, Zhou Zuomin, Zhu Yinjiang, Wu Yunzhai, Zhu Ziqian, Zhang Zuan, holding a total of 21,137 shares. Yu Tianbi, a representative from the Municipal Social Bureau, attended to provide guidance. Li Zu'en was elected as chairman by public vote. After the ceremony, the chairman reported that the number of shareholders and shares present met the legal requirements for holding the meeting. Then, Wu Yun Chu reported on the preparatory process, stating that the Tianchu Flavor Essence Factory was the earliest seasoning factory in the country. Since its establishment 13 years ago, the business has continued to develop. However, it was felt that the original unlimited company structure was sometimes insufficient to meet the demands of the environment. Therefore, two months ago, steps were taken to reorganize it into a limited company. The initial capital was set at 2.5 million yuan, but due to market conditions, it was difficult to raise the funds. It was also estimated that 200,000 yuan of working capital was sufficient for turnover. Therefore, it was changed to 2.2 million yuan. The capital stock has now been fully paid up, and 2 million yuan will be used as the price for the original assets of the unlimited company, which will be transferred to the limited company. The announcement of the establishment was made, and thanks were given to all parties for their support during the preparation period. Next, Yu Tianbi, the representative from the Municipal Social Bureau, delivered a speech. The meeting then began to discuss the proposals. (1) The company's articles of association. (Resolution) Amended and approved. (2) The number of directors and supervisors. (Resolution) Nine directors and three supervisors. The election was held immediately by signed ballot. As a result, Wu Yun Chu, Zhou Zuomin, Li Zu'en, Wu Yunzhai, Zhang Zuan, Xu Zhichan, Chen Pingcheng, Zhu Ziqian, and Lin Dian were elected as directors. Zhang Zuyao, Gao Bojun, and Chen Zheqing were elected as supervisors. (3) Report on the investigation by the directors and supervisors. (Resolution) Director Zhu Ziqian was elected to report. He read it aloud to the public, and it was passed without objection. The meeting adjourned for refreshments at around 6 p.m.</p>
<h3>### Wang Liang Accused of Harming Public Morals and Abandonment; Judge Urges Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Wang Liang, a 31-year-old man from Ningbo who lives at No. 16 Ruan'an Lane, West Gate Road, French Concession, owns a real estate business. He has some savings, wears Western suits, and has his own car. He has a wide social circle. In September of last year, he went to the Xiaohua Garden 12th floor shuyu (a high-class brothel) for entertainment. He met Gu Qinbao, a 17-year-old woman from Changshu, through the introduction of his friends Tao Ziyuan and Li Shoushan. Wang paid for her freedom. After completing the redemption procedures in Room 128 of the Far Eastern Hotel, Wang took the woman to live with him in the Renhe Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, where they had sexual relations. Later, they moved to the Dahua Apartment on Datiebang. Unexpectedly, after several romantic encounters, the woman became pregnant, about six months into the pregnancy. Wang, tired of her, falsely told the woman that he was in legal trouble and could not make a living in Shanghai. He instructed the woman to return to her hometown to live temporarily and that he would send her living expenses every month until things settled, and then he would bring her back to Shanghai. Gu Qinbao believed him and returned to her mother, Gu Yuan, in Changshu. From then on, Wang abandoned the woman and ignored her. The woman sent several letters to Wang urging him to send her daily living expenses, but there was no response. The woman and her mother came to Shanghai and argued with Wang and Tao and Li, but they could not resolve the matter. As the woman's due date was approaching, she was forced to hire a lawyer to file a criminal complaint in the Second Special Court, accusing Wang Liang, Tao Ziyuan, and Li Shoushan of harming public morals and abandonment, requesting that they be prosecuted under Articles 240, 257, 309, and 310 of the old criminal law. Meanwhile, the woman and her mother temporarily resided at No. 47 Ruifu Lane, Zilaihuo Street, awaiting legal resolution. After several hearings by Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special Court, he ordered them to settle out of court. All of this was reported in the newspapers on May 29th of this year. However, although Wang has assets, he is inherently stingy and has repeatedly delayed, failing to show sincerity in reconciliation. As a result, the case has been delayed for more than three months and has not yet been resolved. The plaintiff, Gu Qinbao, gave birth to twins ten days ago. Before and after the birth, she was in a very difficult situation and was only able to get by with the help of others. Yesterday morning, the case was reconvened for further hearing. The plaintiff, Gu Qinbao, arrived in court with her two baby girls and her lawyer, stating her previous hardships and requesting an ancillary civil suit to claim support fees for herself until she reaches the age of sixty and education fees for the two girls until they reach the age of sixteen, totaling 13,300 yuan. The defendant Wang Liang stated that he had already been mediated and agreed to pay 300 yuan to settle the matter, with 100 yuan in cash paid in advance and 200 yuan in promissory notes due on September 10th. Unexpectedly, the cash was taken by the middleman, so the matter could not be resolved. The judge, considering the plaintiff's hardships, ordered the defendant to try to reconcile out of court and gave the defendant some well-intentioned advice. The hearing was adjourned to the morning of the 31st of this month. However, the extension period is short. It is unknown whether the defendant will be able to reconcile sincerely to settle this debt.</p>

<h3>### Japanese Merchants Pay Attention; Italian Artificial Silk Dumping</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reported that the sale of artificial silk in Yunhua is mainly from Japan, Italy, France, the United States, and other countries.

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing in response to an article in your newspaper's Shanghai News column on the 27th of this month entitled "Another Drowning in Liwa Lita Village," which is completely inconsistent with the facts. We are deeply concerned that this may harm our business, so we are providing the true facts and request that you correct the record. Our village is located on the north bank of the Suzhou River, at the Old River Fork, which is a public river, not privately owned by our village. It is also directly connected to the Suzhou River, so villagers and people from the surrounding areas often bathe naked in the river near our village. Our village has repeatedly requested the police to drive them away, but to no avail. Moreover, the river is not privately owned, making it difficult to prevent. Therefore, the drowned Shen Genyou was not a customer of our village, but merely an apprentice at an iron shop. The drowning did not take place in our village. At the time, police officer Wei personally explained this to the Red Cross rescue workers. We hope that the chief editor will understand and appreciate this.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Liwa Lita Village</p>
<p>Corrigendum</p>
<p>In the Qingyang Port Railway Garden Hotel's news about preferential treatment for customers in yesterday's newspaper, the annotation in parentheses in item 2 of the preferential treatment methods, "The price of a yacht is 60 cents per hour," should be corrected to "The price of a yacht is 60 cents per hour."</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn Anecdotes (Huang Lian)</p>
<p>Floods! Floods! I remember the great flood of 1931, which affected seven provinces and displaced tens of millions of people! Only four years have passed, and the disaster area has not yet recovered, but this year's flood has struck again! Countless disaster victims are in deep water and dire straits, urgently awaiting people's relief!</p>
<p>Friends! Do you like to smoke cigarettes? If you do, and you smoke at least ten cigarettes a day, that will cost you 4 cents! That's $1.20 a month! Save half of that to help the flood victims! It's enough to save a life!</p>
<p>Friends! Do you like to drink alcohol? If you do, and you spend at least 10 cents a day, that's $3 a month! Save half of that to help the flood victims! It's enough to save three lives!</p>
<p>Friends! "Save money to help the flood victims!" Why wouldn't we want to do that? Please donate generously!</p>
<p>A Strange Person in Suzhou (Yin Feng)</p>
<p>If a person's temperament, hobbies, actions, and behavior are different from ordinary people, they can be called a strange person. Then the old Mr. X I know is a truly authentic strange person. He is over fifty years old. Twenty or thirty years ago, he worked as an important official in a financial institution in a major commercial port in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. I don't know why, he suffered a great shock, which caused abnormalities in his nervous system. But it is definitely not madness, because he still remembers everything he experienced twenty or thirty years ago. If someone asks him about the situation of all the places he visited at that time, he can still explain it clearly. And now he manages his household affairs in an orderly manner, unlike other madmen, who have attacks from time to time, and during an attack, they know nothing.</p>
<p>Probably he suffered from banknotes in the past, so now as soon as he sees banknotes, he hates them to the core and immediately wants to burn them with fire. He hides silver dollars. Since returning from another city, he has never taken a step outside the gate. He spends most of his time living in the room. Occasionally, he walks out of the room and looks around in the hall. If he sees someone coming in, he will turn around and run away. Although he stays at home all day, he still reads the newspaper every day. When reading the newspaper, he must first put some paste on the four corners of the newspaper and stick it to the wall. Then he stands and reads it in detail from beginning to end. After reading one side, he changes it and sticks it to the wall to read again.</p>
<p>When he eats, he does not use bowls or chopsticks. First, he spreads a newspaper on the table, then pours the rice and vegetables on the newspaper. He sits down, bows his head, and licks it with his tongue. The clothes he wears do not need to be made of good materials, nor do they need to be carefully sewn, because no matter the clothes or pants, he will tear them up after wearing them for three or four days, tearing them into cloth strips like dragging manure.</p>
<p>Golden Grain and Golden House (Jing Jia)</p>
<p>"Study hard! There are golden houses in books, and there are golden grains in books!"</p>
<p>I remember when I was studying in a private school, my grandmother used to tell me this with a trembling voice. At that time, I was still very young, but my grandmother's words had great appeal. I thought that if I studied, I would live in a house made of gold and eat grain like gold. Therefore, I studied very hard, and I memorized everything like "At the beginning of man, his nature is good."</p>
<p>But although I memorized the books very well, I never encountered a golden house or golden grain. Every time I was praised by the teacher for memorizing the books well, I always walked home thinking: "Has my house turned into gold? Has the golden grain come?" But when I got to the door of my house, my house was still a dilapidated tile house, and there was no golden grain in the house. So I often said that my grandmother lied to me. But my grandmother said:</p>
<p>"It's true, there is golden grain in books! But you have to put in effort and take your time!"</p>
<p>So I believed her words again, and I studied patiently and diligently. But now I have been grinding in books for fifteen or sixteen years, where are the golden houses and golden grains that my grandmother said?</p>
<p>Don't cry! Come play with us!</p>
<p>My grandmother has passed away, and I cannot ask her to misinterpret my doubts again. Therefore, this question has to be put aside.</p>
<p>Looking at the increasingly old and dark house, and the pile of books placed in the corner of the house, I couldn't help but say to myself:</p>
<p>"Is it a golden house and golden grain in the end? Or a leaky house and a hungry stomach?"</p>
<p>Don't cry! Come play with us!</p>
<p>Jiang Mi's Perm (Yi Qiu)</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Wuxi Public Security Bureau issued an order to ban perms, and all electric perm equipment in the county's barbershops was confiscated. The reason was that the electric perm machine in a barbershop was damaged, and something went wrong during the perm, resulting in the death of a female customer.</p>
<p>I think there is no need to wait until an accident happens before banning perms. Dying from a perm is a very accidental thing. As long as you follow the simple and unadorned principles of the New Life Movement, it should have been banned long ago.</p>
<p>I really don't understand why a group of ladies and young ladies perm their dark and beautiful hair into dry, yellow, and curly hair like a curly-haired pug. Not to mention the waste of money and time, just the pain suffered during the electric perm is enough to make people abandon it! Think about it! A huge frame is hanging on top, with seventeen or eighteen electric wires and clips, lifting the entire head and all the hair like it's hanging from the third floor. The scalp is heated by the electricity until it's hot, and then it's blown with an electric fan, one cold and one hot. The taste is really uncomfortable, like being in court and being punished. Alas! It's really not worth it to spend money to buy suffering!</p>
<p>It is not necessary to delve into the fact that women "spend money to buy suffering" for the sake of "fashion," because most of those who can afford to perm their hair are women of the leisure class, and their money and time are not that precious anyway.</p>
<p>The most vulgar thing is the perm of a group of young men. You can see it anytime in the city. Some college students, bank employees, young masters, and hooligans also perm their hair like women to be considered beautiful and pretty. It's really ridiculous!</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if perms are beautiful, why is it that the time of young men, who are eagerly awaited by a country and society, is as unimportant as that of women! Their knowledge and vision are as naive as those of women!</p>

<p>Records of Royal Incense (Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou)</p>
<p>"Why do we have to let those French people teach us?" The Empress Dowager interjected disapprovingly.</p>
<p>Knowing that I had just used the word "teach" incorrectly, I quickly explained that it was just a method of using the medicine. Different medicines have different uses. It's not that the French people are necessarily superior. It's just that since they made the medicine, we have to follow their instructions. The Empress Dowager was then appeased.</p>
<p>"How about I translate these instructions for you, Your Majesty?" I asked with the utmost care. "First, it says here that you must wash all your hair together and then dry it completely..."</p>
<p>"Great! Let's try it out!" The Empress Dowager surprisingly agreed immediately.</p>
<p>So someone went out to bring in a large basin of hot water, and the barber was also summoned. But the Empress Dowager did not want him to do it. She only wanted me to help her wash. This task was a bit beyond my ability, and I was afraid that I would hurt the Empress Dowager with my clumsiness. Wouldn't that be terrible? But I couldn't disobey the imperial order, so I had to reluctantly do it. It was very difficult to wash the black ointment out of her hair, and I also washed her scalp clean. Then, I got a few dry towels to dry her wet hair. It took a lot of effort. Fortunately, the old lady was eager to try my French hair dye and was very excited. She was very patient and waited until her hair was dry. Once the hair was dry, it was time to apply the medicine. (402)</p>
<p>Local Customs: Sketches of Japanese Customs (Yan)</p>
<p>The Widow's Inn on Oyase Island</p>
<p>In common practice throughout Japan, young wives who lose their husbands midway through life mostly remain widows for life if they have already had children. If they do not have children, they often find a suitable man to remarry. However, the customs on Oyase Island are somewhat different. What sets them apart from other places is the peculiar custom of the so-called "Widow's Inn."</p>
<p>The Widow's Inn is a place where many widows gather at night to live together. These houses are donated by local gentlemen. In these pigeon-cage-like huts, seven or eight widows often sleep together. Every night, when they enter the Widow's Inn, they think of their beloved husbands and cannot help but feel sad. They cry loudly, and the tragic scene cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>But after they cry together, each person does their own work. Those with children either breastfeed their children or undress their children to sleep. Widows without children can only do sewing work. When night falls and they occasionally think of their husbands, their sexual desires are aroused, so they cannot fall asleep. They talk about sex and love with each other. When they can no longer bear it, they go out to find a partner of the opposite sex. At that time, if they meet someone who is eager for sex and their wills coincide, they can become husband and wife with the permission of the local gentleman and escape the lonely Widow's Inn from then on.</p>
<p>The night before they leave the Widow's Inn, they must wear black mourning clothes with their second husband, bring a monk, come to burn incense, and perform three prostrations. It is said that this is the widow's way of remembering their former husband, expressing their apology, and asking for forgiveness. However, according to the famous archaeologist Kikuchi Okutaro, they are summoning the soul of their former husband so that the former husband's soul can be cast into their womb. It is not yet clear which statement is correct, but in my opinion, the former statement seems more plausible.</p>
<p>Speaking of the first night the widows spend in the Widow's Inn, there is a grand ceremony. Local gentlemen preside over the worship of heaven and earth in that pigeon-cage-like hut. During the ceremony, short white candles are lit and incense is burned. Sixteen nuns are divided into two rows, standing outside the hut, blowing a kind of music that sounds like a flute or whistle. The sound of the music changes from sorrowful to gradually majestic and generous, so it is hoped that the life of the widows will turn from sorrow to majesty. The widows slowly walk into the hut amidst the majestic music. At that time, the audience outside the house all applaud and cheer, wishing the widow happiness in the future. In fact, at this time, the widow's heart is truly about to shatter.</p>
<p>The makeup of the widows on their first night is like that of a bride. Their heads are covered with a pale gray silk scarf, with a few small red stamens on the silk scarf, which looks extremely beautiful when reflected in the candlelight. The painted eyebrows and rouge make them even more gorgeous. The black gauze clothes are embroidered with a crescent-shaped pattern, indicating that it is no longer the time of the full moon. On their waistbands, there are originally various patterns, but on that night, there is only a piece of white, suggesting a pure and clean heart that will no longer be stained by filth. Even the clogs they wear are uniformly colored and have no patterns.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Home Affairs sent personnel to investigate this custom of the Widow's Inn, and it was considered that it was more harmful than beneficial to the development of the people's intelligence, so it actively sought to improve it. However, because this custom has been passed down from the Middle Ages to the present, it will not be easy to completely destroy it in the shortest time.</p>
<p>Little West Heaven (Written by Zhang Henshui)</p>
<p>Chapter Eighteen: Qi Party Extols Flattery, Rebuking Petty Officials, Female Authority Makes Noise, Annoying the Lady</p>
<p>Li Shilian said: This is really not forced. I also call my cousin elder brother. Now that this Mr. Qiu has come, you should go directly to see him. Why did you write a letter to notify him? Jiefu said: I talked with him for more than an hour earlier. Writing this letter is not to say anything to him. I have another memorial to entrust to him to present to Commissioner Lan. To be honest, there are some political views in it. I have written down what I have observed since arriving in Xi'an. Yilian said: If you have a solution, brother, don't forget me. Please come to my room for a seat, okay? I still have two cans brought from Shanghai. Let's open them and eat them. As he spoke, he actually reached out and dragged Jiefu's sleeve. At this time, Jiefu was also uneasy and hesitant, so he followed him into the room for a long talk. Naturally, in the end, he always asked the commissioner to introduce him to an official position. After talking for a while, suddenly the tea house boy came in and said: Mr. Zhang, Commissioner Lan has sent someone to invite you over. When Jiefu heard this, his heart wished it could follow his pulse and jump out of his mouth. He pressed his hands on the table and suddenly stood up, asking: What? Is he calling me? The tea house boy said: Why not? Their servant is still waiting on the side. Jiefu raised his head to Shilian and said: It must be that my letter has taken effect. He hurriedly walked out. He had already reached the gate of the courtyard, but when he looked down at his body, he was not wearing a mandarin jacket. So he ran back to the room like crazy and put on the mandarin jacket. While buttoning the buttons, he walked out. (302)</p>

<p>Municipal Middle and Primary Schools</p>
<p>The Appointment of Teachers Should Be Reported to the Education Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Ordered All Schools to Comply Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to municipal middle and primary schools stating that the first semester of the 24th year of the Republic of China has begun, and the appointment of teachers in each school should be reported in the Teacher Appointment Form to facilitate verification. After approval, the appointment letter will be submitted for verification. Municipal primary schools must also submit a teacher business card for verification. According to recent Teacher Appointment Forms submitted by various schools, items are often omitted, making auditing inconvenient. It is urgently ordered that all municipal primary schools comply with the order. In the future, when submitting Teacher Appointment Forms, all items on the form (such as registration numbers, etc.) should be filled in in detail. The receipt number for verification should be filled in the remarks column of the Teacher Appointment Form for middle schools to facilitate verification. Once the order to approve the appointment is received, except for middle schools, municipal school teacher business cards should be attached when submitting the appointment letter for verification. If various teachers in various primary schools have been reappointed or have been appointed but the stage is not full, and have not previously submitted this business card, they must also go to the bureau to collect</p>

<p>Several Forms of Freedom of Expression in Old Russian Literature by Mei Yu</p>
<p>When we come into contact with the literature of old Russia, from those works, we find nothing but gloom, melancholy, and sentimental atmosphere. Some attribute this to the temperament of the Slavs at the time, because almost all Slavic folk songs are gloomy. However, I think that the dark environment created by the Tsar's rule was the main reason for the emergence of this type of work.</p>
<p>Originally, when the old society was on the verge of collapse and a new system had not yet been created, everything old was shaking and collapsing, and all the thoughts, culture, and morals of the existing society were not believed by those who sought the light. Therefore, in this process of change, people who have not completely shed their old consciousness are inevitably out of order in this contradictory life. They curse the darkness, but the darkness still presses them like a nightmare; they look forward to the light, but the dawn of new life has not yet appeared, so they are always vague and skeptical about the arrival of the light, and thus mostly feel despair and inevitably become sentimental. This phenomenon is most clearly expressed in the literature of old Russia at the end of the nineteenth century. They either embrace the illusion of "Apocalypse" and make dreams outside the sky; or they worship at the altar of mystery, searching for the ideal "beautiful woman"; or they gaze into the eternal chaos, feeling "terror and madness, madness and terror," and curse life and praise death; or they think that life is empty, so they seek the satisfaction of carnal desires, and use Nietzsche's anti-morality as a disguise. Although these people are all immersed in the sea of ​​sentimentality and despair, they have also sought the light, and most of them have a burning heart. While convulsing, they yearn for the dawn and hope for the light. Can we say that Gogol, in despair, would forgive all ugliness? Even Chekhov, who had a particularly strong sentimental atmosphere, said in "Three Sisters": "In two or three hundred years, life in this world will probably become dazzlingly beautiful and brilliant." For example, Andreev, who praised death, in the famous short story "Darkness", he used darkness to defeat the light, and used the prostitute's mouth to say that the world is always dark, but this is his wailing after failing to find the light. Perhaps it is this point that makes old Russian literature win the love of the world.</p>
<p>However, although they longed for the light, none of them found a way to reach the light. They groped in the dark and stumbled. This is because they did not truly understand the inevitable process of social evolution. Therefore, they never grasped the key to darkness and light, and could not break out of the atmosphere of sentimentality, horror, and darkness. Even when the light was already pregnant, they still cursed it blindly. There are such words in "Gray Horse": "What is the result of the revolution? The governor was assassinated, but another governor came. What did we get?" And Andreev hysterically shouted "S.O.S." As for Bunin and Kuprin, they fled with pale faces to the "damp and warm" nest of vulgar materialism.</p>
<p>In this way, it is really not an easy task to grope for the path to light from the darkness. Those who have not fallen into despair, like Tolstoy, can only place their final reliance on religion. Even a profound person like Dostoevsky, in "The Brothers Karamazov," although he wanted to point out a bright way out, it was still not a realistic and feasible one, but an idealized path. He wrote the protagonist Alyosha as a compassionate savior, but he was still an existence beyond reality. Entrusting the light and the hope of the future to God, discerning people know that this is not the right way to get the light. There are so many people in the world who are pursuing the light, but there are also so many who can never climb out of the dark corner. We can see this tragedy in many literary works.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to mention Romain Rolland. When he wrote the first "Enchanted Soul", due to his own worldview, he led the heroine in the book into a dead end and did not know where to go. But in the last volume, he liberated her and completed her as a brave warrior of the times. This is why "Enchanted Soul" is greater and more outstanding than "Jean-Christophe". The reason why Rolland can walk to the path of light is firstly because he does not regard literature as a pastime (this is the same as many old Russian writers above); secondly, it is because he is experiencing this great tragedy today, he mixes with the masses and feels the tragedy of one system and the comedy of the birth of another. His breathing is in rhythm with the breathing of the whole. This is where Rolland is great, and it is also the best guarantee for him to obtain the path of light.</p>
<p>These many facts tell us, then, how carefully should we, the young people whose hearts are burning with the unquenchable fire of hope, grasp the key to light and darkness in the process of seeking light!</p>
<h3>Skirmish</h3>
<p>Black Infant</p>
<p>The newspaper today reported shocking overseas news. The island of Sumatra, where the overseas Chinese and indigenous groups fought, is exactly where I grew up. My home is still on a street in Medan, the capital city there, which is not very lively and still retains some primitive state. Although the skirmish started on the side of East Sibolga, the struggles of racial animosity often expand quickly, so I cannot hope that the skirmish will not spread to Medan. I put down the newspaper and stood silently by the window for a while, watching the autumn clouds in the sky. In my memory, I picked up the lost time—there was a skirmish once.</p>
<p>The beginning of the accident is often very vague. At that time, I was very young and didn't know anything about it beforehand. In the morning, as usual, I got up earlier than my mother, dragged my wooden clogs, took off my clothes and went to the shower room. The water was cold, but it turned into a burst of steam when it hit the body of someone who had eaten too many chili peppers. By the time everyone got up and prepared to eat breakfast, I had already read a page of books and planned to go to school after breakfast.</p>
<p>But halfway through the meal, someone rushed in anxiously. His trembling voice called out to my father, and said, "Do you know what's going on outside? It's terrible outside! Outside now... they've already started fighting with the 'foreign devils'!"</p>
<p>I didn't know what that was all about. I put down my rice bowl and listened to the anxious visitor telling my father that the "foreign devils" stabbed the younger brother of the owner of the ×× coffee shop to death with a parang knife at night.</p>
<p>"It was a terrible stabbing," he said, gritting his teeth, "his intestines were all spilling out, lying on the road like a dead dog. His wife was crying like crazy, simply rolling on the ground..."</p>
<p>"Why did they stab him to death?" my father asked.</p>
<p>"Well, that's a long story! You should prepare now, close the doors and be careful when going out; it's best to keep the children at home!"</p>
<p>Then that person left.</p>
<p>I was really kept at home by my father, and I wasn't allowed to go out. I argued that I had to go to school, but it was indeed dangerous to go out. When the flames of murder were high, wouldn't a defenseless child be in vain—"In short, you can't go out." Saying this to me, my father told my mother and family to try their best to keep an eye on me. He put on his clothes and planned to go to the company for a while.</p>
<p>"You'd better not go out either," my grandmother said.</p>
<p>"I'll be fine," he said.</p>
<p>My mother didn't say a word. From the way she stared intently at my father leaving the house, I discovered that she had a heart that was more uneasy than anyone else's. At this time, I was a little curious, thinking how great it would be if I could go out with my father once. I didn't have the habit of being kept at home all day without going out, so I felt extremely bored in my heart. Occasionally, taking advantage of people's unpreparedness, I opened a crack in the window and peeked at the street from the small crack: the originally quiet street was now even more silent. The hottest area of ​​the skirmish was naturally not on our side, so there was no movement at all. We were waiting for my father to come back.</p>
<p>As usual, he rang the doorbell outside at lunchtime. The maid went to answer the door timidly; knowing that the owner of the house had returned, she immediately opened the door happily again. At lunch, my father told us about the skirmish. The cause is still not very clear. It was probably because the younger brother of the owner of the coffee shop often took his companions to the residential area of ​​the natives and hooked up with the wives of the natives; later, this secret was discovered, and the insulted husband led his companions to the coffee shop to seek revenge. That's how the two sides clashed. That was the day before yesterday. The natives attacked again at night, and the younger brother of the owner of the shop finally died under their knives.</p>
<p>"Then are there any other people injured?" Grandma asked.</p>
<p>"Not very clear," my father put a mouthful of rice in his mouth, "There must be some. We'll know when the newspaper comes out later."</p>
<p>For this kind of skirmish that disrupted public order, the local colonial government naturally had to do its best to suppress it. But at that time, the two races were already hostile to the point of being on the verge of conflict; we quickly discovered that natives were throwing stones at the Chinese people's houses on our street. So the police immediately increased patrols on the street. I didn't have a chance to leave the house for two full days.</p>
<p>On the third day, my father came back from outside and reported good news to us: the skirmish was finally resolved. We were so happy that we didn't want to ask how it was resolved. Like a bird out of a cage, I walked to the street. There were not many pedestrians yet, and the shops had not fully reopened. Although the conflict had eased, I always harbored hostility in my heart when I saw the "foreign devils", and I did so even in front of people I knew. I didn't know how long it took before the traces of this skirmish disappeared...</p>
<p>However, now that I have grown up and left that place of growth far away, I hear the sound of this terrible skirmish again. Why do the suffering nations in the same world of the strong eating the weak kill each other? For the happiness of mankind, it is necessary to work together; thinking of this, I cannot restrain my heartache.</p>
<h3>Birth</h3>
<p>Da Bao</p>
<p>As if foreseeing the pain of birth,</p>
<p>It cried loudly as soon as it landed.</p>
<p>Thousands of ancestors have shouted like this,</p>
<p>But this primitive resistance,</p>
<p>Who can avoid the suffering of life in the future?</p>
<p>"Good or bad,</p>
<p>There must always be an offspring to inherit the lamp."</p>
<p>Mother, chanting like this in pain.</p>
<p>She prays for the growth of this new life,</p>
<p>Looking at the dawn in the skylight,</p>
<p>Sincerely begging for the blessing and mercy of the gods.</p>
<p>"The rioting soldiers have taken your father away,</p>
<p>Who can life rely on?"</p>
<p>Lowering her head, as if foreseeing the unbearable ending in the future.</p>
<p>"Born in troubled times, life is originally a burden!"</p>
<p>Cursing, she began to cry...</p>
<h3>Turmoil in the Family</h3>
<p>Xi Cun</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Da Lin got up very early in the morning. She was a new bride who had only been married for two months, so naturally she had to be more diligent in her work.</p>
<p>She was only nineteen years old, young, and like all young girls and daughters-in-law, she had her lovable qualities. That is to say, she was decent-looking and not lacking in intelligence, especially a pair of smiling eyes, which made everyone who saw her happy.</p>
<p>Da Lin, although a countryman, knew how to cherish a good wife, so the couple's feelings were very harmonious. They hadn't blushed once in two months, and there was even less talk of arguing.</p>
<p>Now, Sister-in-law Da Lin is wiping the utensils in her mother-in-law's room. She is doing this according to her mother-in-law's words. On the morning of the fourth day after she entered the house, her mother-in-law instructed her like this:</p>
<p>"Get up in the morning and tidy up my room first, then do other things, do you hear me?"</p>
<p>From that day on, apart from washing her face and combing her hair as the first thing in the morning, the second thing she did was to go to her mother-in-law's room to tidy up.</p>
<p>In private, Da Lin often told her some words in a kind tone:</p>
<p>"Mom is old, and sometimes she says things that are not right, you have to forgive her a little. You can't do things against her wishes, she is always my mom. I know she has a bad temper, but it's pitiful that she has been a widow for ten years, watching me grow up. You just have to remember this one good thing."</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Da Lin listened to her husband's words. Sometimes when her mother-in-law really lost her temper with her, she really didn't say a word, as if nothing had happened, and she still did her job as usual, and still sent a bag of tobacco to her mother-in-law, smiling and saying:</p>
<p>"Mom, have a bag."</p>
<p>Within two months, Sister-in-law Da Lin was very handy in her work. She tidied up the house very cleanly, and was fully qualified in cooking and washing clothes. Even her mother-in-law often praised her son and daughter-in-law to others for how capable they were, and also said that from now on, she could let go of the things in the house, and it was not in vain that she had been a widow for many years. This morning, Sister-in-law Da Lin was wiping her mother-in-law's mirror. This mirror was really too old, and half of it had lost its mercury. Every time she wiped it, she always used some extra effort, wanting to make the mirror surface brighter. As she wiped, she didn't know why, but suddenly she felt a burst of dizziness, and her mouth felt like she was going to vomit. In a moment of distraction, she let the mirror in her hand fall to the ground.</p>
<p>The mirror surface shattered. What she picked up was an empty mirror frame. She was frightened, her heart pounding, and she stared blankly at the broken mirror shards.</p>

<h3>Love (6)</h3>
<p>By S. Ersegyev Zinsky, Translated by Su Ming</p>
<p>His overturned boat was now so deeply buried in the snow that he could only guess it was there. So after countless endless days of cold and darkness, the sky began to clear, and the cold was not so numbing, and when he saw the black keel of the boat exposed outside the snow, he almost shouted, "Good, they didn't take it away."</p>
<p>A patch of fist-sized azure sky appeared, and Savaka shouted towards the dark forest, towards the river still frozen by ice, and towards the remaining wolf pack that began to jump on the soft snow.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the ice broke and the river flooded, Savaka happily turned his boat back into the river, carrying all his possessions, including the wolf skins, sat down beside the paddle, and headed far north along his dirty, yellow river. He was alone in his small boat, on a swollen river, between two banks now so far apart that they could not be seen in the middle of the river, surrounded by large pine trees that were as wolfish and malicious, and they seemed to be heading north, desperately leaning towards the ocean, just like him. Savaka was filled with a happy, warm feeling, respecting himself, his strong body, his tenacious character, and even his reckless adventure.</p>
<p>"Red Head," he shouted loudly. "You should come and see Savaka Koulte now."</p>
<p>The river carried him for two months. When he was tired, he would row to the shore, take out his rifle to hunt for a while, and then go to sleep. The banks became flat, desolate, and thin—the Arctic wasteland. Savaka was not surprised at all about what was ahead. But all the time he was thinking about the people who, like him, were heading north in search of the ocean. He had not met a single person, but he might still meet them.</p>
<p>One day, while he was fast asleep on the boat, he was awakened by a sudden jolt. He saw his boat drifting into a huge pine tree floating nearby, lying sideways and entangled in the branches. Savaka tried his best to use the paddle to clear the obstacles for himself, but only broke the paddle. So, angrily climbing onto the bow of the boat, he began to chop the pine branches with his axe. But the pine tree flowed downstream, carrying the boat with it, almost capsizing it. Savaka fell into the water, and the boat, still floating on the surface of the water, began to drift downstream. Savaka was freezing cold, and he thought, "Oh, this is the end." But he clung to the pine tree, and his axe fell to the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>Wet and cold, he straddled the pine tree, and when his boat floated away before his eyes, he almost cried. In his despair, his luck came. The boat was entangled by another big tree. Savaka, wearing a wet sheepskin coat and heavy leather boots half-immersed in water, climbed and swam, braving the water, until he could reach the side of the boat. He finally climbed onto the side of the boat. Tired, he sank to the bottom of the river. After that, he didn't remember anything until he finally woke up on an English ship, right at the mouth of the river, and indeed in the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Local Supplement: On Words Insulting Women</h3>
<p>Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The other day, the municipal government, in accordance with a notice from the Ministry of Interior, investigated and banned words insulting women. Now the municipal government has instructed all newspaper offices to comply, and in the future, they must not publish such words to avoid bad social impacts. According to the Jiangsu Provincial Women's Association's petition to ban such words, "We believe that domestic newspapers often contain words that insult or scold women. Or when news is published, its content, although not entirely without basis, mostly only passively exposes women's weaknesses, and rarely actively guides women to the right path. As a result, it not only damages the reputation of all women, but also hinders the morality of the entire society. In order to correct public opinion and safeguard women's rights, it is necessary to petition for a strict ban on publication."</p>
<p>Words that insult women can indeed sometimes be seen in domestic newspapers. It is necessary to correct such words, without involving any "reputation" or "morality," simply based on their malicious and frivolous motives. However, there are very few such articles filled with insults. Articles that expose women's weaknesses are more common. However, such articles cannot be considered insults. At least, they have a passive effect of awakening women. Moreover, their content is based on facts. If women did not have such weaknesses, they would have no way to expose them.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if such articles that expose women's weaknesses inevitably have some insulting elements, which damage women's reputation and hinder social morality. However, relying solely on banning is a passive measure to correct public opinion and safeguard women's rights. In fact, women's weaknesses still exist. Therefore, in addition to correction, women must further conduct a self-examination. After the examination, if any weaknesses are found, they should be improved immediately. Only in this way can there be hope of removing women's weaknesses.</p>
<h3>The Life of the Malays</h3>
<p>Cong Long</p>
<p>The life of the Malays in Kota Bharu is mostly engaged in agriculture and horticulture. When your "wind car" leaves the city center and goes to the suburbs, you can see endless dense coconut groves and verdant rice fields covering the clear blue sky, charmingly smiling in the warm tropical breeze. How elegant and beautiful its posture is!</p>
<p>The Malay natives' method of farming is so simple: seeds are sown every year in the eleventh month of their Malay calendar (about the eighth month of our lunar calendar). Before sowing, they first hoe and cut away the rice and weeds in the fields, then set a fire to burn them. When it rains and the fields are wet, they haphazardly insert the rice seedlings. In this way, the seeds are successfully sown, and then they only have to sit and wait for the harvest. Their annual farming busy season averages less than two full months. At the same time, they do not need to fertilize or weed; there are no droughts or floods; and the products that are produced are abundant and good. Cultivating and harvesting only once a year is enough for a family of several people to spend the whole year and have surplus! Therefore, they feel no energy for anything. They have plenty of time to be lazy, steal peace, chat, and waste time indifferently.</p>
<p>Their harvesting method is so childish, it's almost like primitive times, which makes people laugh even more! When the rice ears are ripe, we can see many brown faces under the hot sun, with a small bamboo basket hanging on their arms, picking the ripe golden rice ears in the fields—picking them slowly, one by one. Then, they gather these rice ears together, and several people walk barefoot on them, as if the girls in the French grape region are treading grape juice, crushing the grains. These methods, which their ancestors passed down centuries ago, are still "following the ancient method" year after year. They never think of improving, and they don't know that agriculture in the world has entered the era of mechanization and electrification.</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>It can be said that all the Malays in Kota Bharu believe in Islam. They believe that the god "Allah" is the creator of all things in the world, the supreme god with the greatest power in the universe; everything they have is given by the god "Allah." Therefore, they must recite the Koran (the Islamic scriptures) very piously five times a day. Every Friday, no matter what important things they have, they must stop and go to the church together to face west, standing on the ground to recite scriptures and pray. On this day, the theaters in Kota Bharu are closed as usual. They respect the "Ah Shi," who have been to Muhammad's birthplace—Mecca—and wear black velvet hats or white hats on their heads, as elders. These people are the most powerful in this place.</p>
<p>The Malays also have a kind of "circumcision," which is said to be a rule of the old religion. However, it is still practiced in Kota Bharu, and it is regarded as a solemn and important event. Before every man develops, he must have his partner cut off a small piece of the foreskin of his genitals. After a woman gives birth, she must also have a monk pierce her labia with a needle, dripping drops of blood. This is just like every Siamese person must convert to Buddhism for life and become a monk once. Otherwise, they cannot be close to the gods, receive the blessings and protection of the gods; and they will be ridiculed, despised, rejected, and spend their lives in solitude!</p>
<h3>Middle Age</h3>
<p>Ling Zixi</p>
<p>In the days when no one asked about me, in loneliness, I finally found some trembling, unpleasant, and horrifying sentences from the notes of a distant acquaintance: This is like a needle piercing the heart, "When people reach middle age, everything is sad!"</p>
<p>Like a nightmare that strikes in the unmanned night, and like a strong electric current passing through me, looking at this, I jumped up in panic; "Middle age"! What kind of obscure and ominous word is that, what else does it imply to people besides gloomy sinking?</p>
<p>It is an unsolvable mystery, "When people reach middle age, everything is sad!"</p>
<p>However, I pray, please don't use these terrible sentences to remind (no, stab) me again. In the difficult-to-deal-with life, in the layers of accumulated pain and unhappiness, I have been living for so long, and now when I think about it, it is just like a pile of broken exploration dreams (however, in this short but dark life journey, how many times has the explorer had his preparation and luggage? It is a naked and lonely body, and every treacherous storm is like lightning" hitting). However, even if it is a short journey, it is unimaginably treacherous. Walking it requires courage, tenacity, hard work, and youth—but now it is said to be "middle age"!</p>
<p>It is a brown noun, a noun with countless terrible prices.</p>
<p>Like a lonely passerby who has lost his raincoat and stands blankly in the heavy rain, standing on this dripping wasteland, I saw the brown twilight, and I was at a loss.</p>
<p>The road of life (and, again, it is a barren wasteland) is unimaginably long, and the countless creatures meandering on it are like downward-flowing water, constantly being pushed and squeezed by a force, making people want to stop but cannot stop, rushing straight down this thorny road; thus, people are squeezed from the smiles of infants into the purple passion of youth, from youth to brown middle age, and then gray old age comes; the last thing to be placed is the grave, which, like death, is dark.</p>
<p>Abandon it—perhaps some people think so—abandoned fantasies, abandoned hope, abandoned passion, and abandoned strength and hard work.</p>
<p>However, for a person who has swum over from a nearly dead giant wave, this is unwilling. Suffering, what is their purpose, is it said that everything human strength should be abandoned so easily and unconditionally?</p>
<p>I can't bear to do this; however, what can I do—courage and strength are all sinking like the setting sun, it's "middle age"!</p>
<p>Yes, without a doubt, like a child wading on thin ice, one slip of the foot, and he irreversibly travels to the end of the road of youth, and falls into the ice cave of middle age. In the cold black water, people will begin a terrible "middle age."</p>
<p>There is no need to desperately miss the days of spring, it is useless; the heart cavity has added gray and white stars just like the strands of hair (is this also considered a record of "life experience"?), and people are as vast as the moon in a foggy night.</p>
<p>The heart, like a field harvested in late autumn, gradually feels desolate and indifferent, and learns to take everything lightly. This mood has never been experienced before. Could it be that this is the so-called "everything is sad"?</p>
<p>So, I picked up a pen and wrote to my acquaintance: "Yes, irreversibly, we have all fallen into middle age; but, let it be, to see a brown mood, maybe it's novel..."</p>
<p>In this way, I began the days of middle age...</p>
<h3>Greeting Autumn: A Free Verse</h3>
<p>Shi Lucun</p>
<p>—For Lian Ni</p>
<p>Greeting the dusk at the end of August, what gently blows is the evening breeze with the desolate taste of autumn. Lian Ni, where are you? —Thinking of the wandering on the Liwa Lida River when the osmanthus flowers were yellow, you boasted about the scent of chestnuts and told me, "Look, isn't that a red glow on the horizon?" I am a lover of red; however, I am not a believer in socialism. Leaning back and tapping the gunwale with my fingers, I sang, "In the good night of May, Lian Ni!" I feel that I love you.</p>
<p>(I love Lian Ni's lychee-kernel-like eyes in the southern canola garden. When I face them, I can feel her tenderness from that deepest blackness. Sometimes I dig out the secrets hidden in her heart from there: the secrets of a girl's heart.)</p>
<p>(I love Lian Ni's sensible, small, cherry-like mouth. Is it not Lian Ni's mouth that gushes out like a mountain spring from it, giving me a cool feeling? What I can't forget is the stimulating taste of Tangee applied to her lips. When I kiss her, it's as if I have grown a thousand pairs of wings, and I suddenly fly up!)</p>
<p>Lian Ni also has a snake-like waist. That day, when she was dancing in Martopol, she was always smiling slightly. "Look, isn't that a fool pointing at us and talking by the table over there?" Following her gaze, I looked into the distance: it was my old friend who was talking to someone with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I asked him: "What do you think of Lian Ni?"</p>
<p>"A beauty!" he said with a sigh. "When she dances with you, it's like a colorful snake wrapped around your body, she has a snake-like figure. When will you let me meet her, okay?"</p>
<p>"But you don't have the ability to fight snakes!" Saying that, I walked away.</p>
<p>Lian Ni, can you hear me? Men other than socialists will worship you. He said you are a colorful snake, but when you take advantage of the ninety-degree summer and run to the diving board of the swimming pool and dive into the water, "Mermaid!" I shouted in surprise standing by the pool.</p>
<p>Summer is Lian Ni's favorite season. Isn't it? Wore a Vienna veil robe on her body without wearing a fox fur coat, and drifted without socks on feet to my Apartment that Lian Ni get burned! I like to be surrounded by summer season dreams so bachelor can just listen to the "In the good night of May, Lian Ni!" broadcasting in night quietly while sitting in front of the radio.</p>
<p>And now, summer is leaving my surroundings quietly, without even saying goodbye. Greeting the cool breeze at the end of August in the evening, constantly thinking of my Lian Ni, I remember your lychee-kernel-like eyes and cherry-like mouth. I remember Lian Ni's hundred kinds of goodness. But Lian Ni, where are you? I stretch out a hundred pairs of hands to hug you, I call you in a thousand languages.</p>
<p>It is already the season when autumn is coming. "Lian Ni is a good companion in autumn when it's lonely," hearing these words, I was anxiously walking through the streets and alleys, from this side to that side, looking for the lost dream! The lost person!</p>
<p>When will you return like a swallow? The autumn day in Jiangnan is bright, Lian Ni.</p>
<h3>Clothing Trunk Pavilion</h3>
<p>Li Dan</p>
<p>When the distant, vast sea gradually and vaguely reveals green mountains, the travelers trapped on the rocking shipping ship begin to show joyful expressions. With jumping, expectant, and excited hearts, seeing the beautiful Saigon Port with its ninety-nine bays, everyone thought they would leave the depressing ocean journey and reach the destination of rest.</p>
<p>Green plains, fluttering soft winds, clear skies, the appearance of the southern country, greet the travelers with ease and smiles. I thought to myself: That's right, this is a good place!</p>
<p>The ship docked, but free hands and feet could not freely step onto the good place to rest. The travelers' joy all disappeared, only trouble, anxiety, fatigue, pain, and humiliation remained. After many bizarre procedures, they became people who had lost their freedom. Finally, released from the New Guest Office, they had to go to the Clothing Trunk Pavilion. At this time, everyone sighed:</p>
<p>"The journey has reached a terrible foreign land!"</p>
<p>Staggering out of the New Guest Office, the body has regained its freedom, but the luggage has not yet gained its freedom. The luggage is sent to the Clothing Trunk Pavilion. That is another barrier. Everyone</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>competes to squeeze up, but cannot let go of their worries. What is this barrier like?</p>
<p>It is getting late. If they can't get it today, they have to wait until tomorrow. Everyone has to squeeze desperately. They are always uneasy if they don't get their things. They squeeze too chaotically. The leather whips inside fly around with a "pat, pat, pat" sound. The crowd collapses like a broken levee, falling in disorder. Those who are whipped touch their wounds, and everyone stares in astonishment. I feel like I have broken into a bizarre country. My heart is beating nervously, and my whole body is sore and tired, making it difficult to support myself. But the owner here scolds: "You Chinese people are like wild boars!"</p>
<p>I don't know why I am so timid. I hear the sound of the whip waving, the loud shouting; I see the stern owner standing there without a smile, the natives who are executing the inspection and turning over the trunks, and the compatriots who are pushed out of the door. Their ugly complexions, messy luggage, and clamorous curses make me feel like I have suffered a great disaster myself. I regret coming to this foreign land called the land of gold!</p>
<p>Several times I mustered up the courage and struggled to squeeze up, but I always rolled back when I encountered the whip after squeezing until I was covered in sweat!</p>
<p>"You Chinese people are like wild boars!" This voice is reverberating again.</p>
<p>I don't understand foreign languages, and I don't know where to go to get our luggage, so I just stand there in panic and stare blankly. I dare not let my gaze touch the tall, stern owner sitting above. But he is fiercely injecting us, this group of Chinese people who are like wild boars.</p>
<p>After hitting several snags and being pushed back and forth, I finally saw my trunk. I remember that I locked it; however, the trunk that had not been opened was already as messy as a garbage dump inside. I just pant anxiously and watch the inspector constantly rummage through the things in the trunk, and some of them are thrown out of the trunk. My eyes feel a little blurry. He pulls out two sets of new white silk clothes and says something to me in a language I don't understand. Before he finishes speaking, another person pulls out a few feet of cloth, and I almost lose consciousness. But I see that there are similar situations next to me, and the owners of the things take out money to hand over, and some even get slapped. I am very afraid of that thick palm. Finally, I also hurriedly take out banknotes, but it's not enough, so I add up to seven yuan! After that, I am pushed away, and the trunk in my arms falls to the ground again. Walking out of the Clothing Trunk Pavilion, I shed a few tears inexplicably! Looking at the sky, it is no longer clear, and my vision is a little blurry.</p>

<h3>Opening: "Awakening from the Dream of the Red Chamber"</h3>
<p>The Precious Mirror of Love has no feelings. The illusion of the Realm of Great Emptiness is falsely created. Form is emptiness, and emptiness is form. Twelve golden hairpins are listed on the painted screen. He falsely claims to be a piece of stone left by Nuwa. Drinking the wind and absorbing dew, it actually has spirituality. It is also said that it is an unfounded thought of entering a non-existent realm. There is a blade of grass next to the stubborn stone. In the world, there are stones with and without feelings. He said that the stubborn stone was born with feelings. The cheapest thing in the world is the spring grass. He insisted that it was the most affectionate person in the world. Whether with or without feelings, it is emotionless once written into the Dream of the Red Chamber. Look at the women in the Rong and Ning mansions. Which one has a happy marriage and family? Lin Daiyu, Shi Xiangyun, Xue Baochai, Jia Yuanchun, they all died young, widowed, or disabled. Wang Xifeng, with her cleverness, eventually became self-defeating in her cleverness. It is a pity to be lost in the world of love. The silkworm bound in its cocoon cannot escape. Blame Cao Xueqin for harming people.

<h3>Multiple Robberies in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>In the desolate area south of Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai, robberies have occurred frequently in the past two months. These include the homes of Chen Jinshan in Wangjiaqiao, Pan Bingyu in Panjiao, Longhua, the grocery store opened by Yang Xinglin in the Nanchen residence, Shen Adi in Shenjiatang, Sun Genglang, and the residences of two individuals surnamed Yu in Xiwang, as well as the grocery store recently opened by Cheng Zhonglian in Chenjiangqiao. These seven robbery cases remain unsolved.</p>
<p>Recently, the home of Chenjiatang, a well-to-do farmer in Chenjiatang, who built nine new rooms last winter, was also coveted by bandits. Early in the morning (27th) around one o'clock, eight bandits speaking in mixed accents, wearing short shirts and trousers, and white towels tied around their heads, broke down the door and entered. The entire Chen family was awakened from their dreams and driven into a room by the bandits. The bandits pulled out handguns, preventing anyone from making a sound. They rummaged through boxes and chests, searching arbitrarily. It is estimated that they stole silver dollars, clothing, and ornaments worth over a hundred dollars. After more than an hour, they finally left with loud cries. Afterwards, the victim prepared a list of losses and reported it to Chief Gao of the Hongqiao Police Station. After receiving the report, the chief personally led officers to search and apprehend the bandits. However, they had fled very quickly, and by the time the police arrived, the bandits were long gone.</p>
<h3>Ewo Silk Company - Reward for Arrest of Thieves Who Stole Rayon - Reward of 2,000 Dollars</h3>
<p>The import department of the Ewo Silk Company in Shanghai discovered that on May 30th of this year, thirty cases of rayon stored in the warehouse of Ruifeng Transportation Company were fraudulently taken away by criminals who forged warehouse receipts. After the discovery, the company reported the incident to various police agencies to apprehend the fraudsters. Three months have passed, but the fraudsters have not been caught. The company issued a reward of two thousand dollars yesterday. Anyone who can provide information leading to the arrest and conviction of the fraudsters in court will receive the reward of two thousand dollars.</p>
<h3>Slaughtering Companies Secretly Increase Transportation Fees - Party Headquarters to Summon for Questioning Today</h3>
<p>Over a thousand fresh meat businesses in the Shanghai International Settlement are resisting the secret increase in transportation fees by the four slaughtering companies, namely Su-Xi, Ning-Hu, Ning-Hai, and Ren-Yuan. They jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters some time ago, requesting a strict investigation. Representatives such as Chen Longhu and Mao Yicheng were also sent to petition. It is now known that the Municipal Party Headquarters, after receiving the petition from the businesses, has scheduled a meeting today to summon representatives from the four companies for questioning. After the questioning, a date will be set for mediation.</p>
<h3>Garrison Headquarters Verdict - Changzhou Station Smuggling Opium Case - Criminal Acts of Defendants Zheng Chunhe, Zhang Wu, etc. - Transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Anti-Smoking Office for Punishment</h3>
<p>On July 13th of this year, the Dansu First Section of the Jinghu-Huhangyong Railway Administration Police Department discovered twenty-two kilograms of smuggled opium thrown from a locomotive as the Sixth Shanghai-Beijing Night Express passed Yangqi outside Changzhou Station. Two people receiving the opium, Zhang Wu (also known as Zhang San) and Gao Liuchun (also known as Gao Guangcheng), were arrested on the spot. The police immediately telegraphed the Jingdan Police Section to arrest the driver Liu Tingliang, the chief fireman Wang Jinsheng, and the assistant fireman Zheng Xuewen on the locomotive. After questioning, the suspects and the opium were transferred to the Shanghai District Court on the 18th. The court then transferred the case to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for trial. It is now known that the case has been tried and sentenced by the Garrison Headquarters according to law. Gao Liuchun was sentenced to six months imprisonment and a fine of five hundred dollars for inciting the transportation of opium. Liu Tingliang, Zheng Xuewen, and Wang Jinsheng were sentenced for jointly transporting opium. Liu Tingliang was sentenced to three months imprisonment and a fine of five hundred dollars. Zheng Xuewen and Wang Jinsheng were each sentenced to three months imprisonment and a fine of one hundred dollars. The criminal acts of the defendants Zheng Chunhe and Zhang Wu will be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Office of the Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office for punishment.</p>
<h3>Domestic Dispute Between Wife and Concubine - Zhu Dingbang Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Zhu Dingbang, a native of Longhua in the western countryside of this county, was eleven fifteen years old this year. He was originally surnamed Zhang and was adopted by his maternal uncle's family, surnamed Zhu, as his heir. He received a secondary education and graduated from middle school. He is currently employed as a foreman at Dafeng Rubber Printing at 33 Shoufu Lane, Caishi Road in the French Concession. He had already married a wife and wanted to bring her to Shanghai to live with him. However, his parents needed a daughter-in-law to take care of the fields and household chores at home and did not allow Zhu to bring her to Shanghai. Zhu was alone in Shanghai and felt lonely. He became acquainted with a woman named Zhu Yangxue and cohabited with her in a pavilion room at 9 Chengqing Lane, Caishi Road. Recently, Zhu suddenly felt troubled by domestic disputes between his wife and concubine, leading him to contemplate suicide. On the evening of the 27th, around 10 o'clock, he went to the Oriental Apartments at the intersection of Beile Road and Ximen Road, using the alias Zhu Guanghui, and booked room 28, claiming to be staying overnight. He then ingested Lysol poison to commit suicide. Before taking the poison, he wrote five or six suicide notes. At noon the next day, Shancha Fang Shuangliankuan (24 years old, from Yangzhou) discovered that Zhu had already died on the bed, his body ice-cold. He reported the incident to the French Concession Police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. His uncle, Zhu Ruisong (65 years old, residing at 24 Deshan Lane, Baiyunguan, Fangxie Road), was notified according to the suicide notes to come to the station. It is expected that the Second Special Court will be requested to send personnel for inspection today.</p>

<h3>Flood Relief Entertainment Event Sends Letters to Appoint Dance Selection Committee Members - Preparatory Meeting Scheduled for This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The flower selection initiated by the Flood Relief Entertainment Event has seen very enthusiastic voting in recent days. The originally designated heads of the "Sex" and "Art" categories have been changed due to misunderstandings of the terms. The head of the "Sex" category will now be called the head of the "Emotion" category, and the head of the "Art" category will be called the head of the "Technique" category. Voting will cease on September 4th, and the results will be announced at a later date. It is said that the flower sisters who have hopes of being elected are campaigning fiercely. The association is actively preparing for the star and dance selections. Regarding the star selection, President Wang Xiaolai, Vice Presidents Shen Tianxin and Chen Jicheng, and Chairman of the Board Lin Kanghou, have sent letters inviting movie stars from the city to a reception at the Atlantic Restaurant on the evening of August 30th to discuss the star selection methods.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhengqiu's Relief Sculpture Completed</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, a pioneer of Chinese cinema and a respected senior figure in the theatrical world, promoted art and dedicated himself to film for several decades, achieving great accomplishments. Unfortunately, due to overwork and dedication to his duties, Mr. Zheng passed away from illness last month. The news of his death has been met with widespread grief. It is reported that the China Art Society at 216 Pushi Road in this city, in order to promote the glory of Chinese film history and to permanently commemorate Mr. Zheng, specially hired the sculptor Deng Lianqing to create a relief sculpture of Mr. Zheng, 24 inches high and 16 inches wide. The likeness is perfect and lifelike, and it has been praised by Mr. Zheng's family. In order to promote art and meet social needs, the society has made several plaster casts to commemorate him. It is said that each cast is only charged for the cost of materials and labor, three dollars. Local addresses can be sent by letter, and a special messenger will deliver the cast. A photograph of the sculpture is attached below.</p>
