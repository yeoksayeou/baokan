<h3 id="c35">對於兒童節之希望 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 幼雄</p>
<p>我國之有兒童節。迄今已第玉屆矣。歷年每逢此日。凡主辦兒童敎養事業之團體機關。或則乘機舉行兒童健康比賽。或則特別供給兒童娛樂塲所。務使兒童在此節日。得有快樂之機會。往事追憶。足稱盛舉。本屆兒童節。因兒童年實施在卽。中央命令作大規校之慶祝。故其盛况。更勝於前。以事事落後之中國。對於兒童能加相當之注意。此誠足爲全國兒童慶。爲國家前途賀也。</p>
<p>兒童爲社會國家未來之主人翁。欲謀國家之强旺。民族之興盛。自不能不置重於兒童之敎餋。故各國對於兒童權利。莫不有法律爲之保障。愛倫凱女士至稱二十世紀爲兒童世紀。亦足徵兒童權運動之重要矣。更進一步言之。國步艱雌。至今日殆達極點。吾輩成人。固當努力。然今後復興國家之一部分重荷。勢將落諸今日之兄童。卽未來主人之肩上。今日對於兒童。設若不予以知識道德之培養。與夫健康之保護。迨其成長。豈能成爲良好之公民。欲令其負國家復典之重荷。不其難乎。故吾人於今日兒童之培餋。良不容忽視。而兒童權利之保障。健康之維護。敎育之普及。皆關於兒童培養之最重要者。吾人今日宜自省。對此數者果已克盡厥職矣乎。</p>
<p>所謂權利之保障。卽兒童有受養育之權利。而此權利宜予以法律上之保護也。然在今日之中國。以言養。則棄嬰溺嬰。　子賣女之風。尙未全絕。工廠法雖已頒布。禁止童工。而全國童工之數。有調查者。已在六萬以上。此等兒童不能受父母之養。而反犧牲其未發育之身軀以養父母。天下之慘酷事。寗有過於此者。以言敎育。我國强迫義務敎育制。尙未施行。敎育經費。十分支絀。能受義務敎育之兒童。全國平均。僅及學齡兒童百分之二十二。以言健康。我國兒童衛生素不講究。各種體格缺點。逐慚增長。（參閱二十三·二十四年本報年鑑衛生編。）而兒童死亡率。更較任何國家爲高。夫今日以前。我國兒童。敎養方面。旣均有巨大之缺　。則今日以後。吾人之所應努力者可知矣。</p>
<p>今者國人對於兒童。已有相當之注意。政府亦以明令規定自本年八月一日起至明年七月底止爲兒童年。吾人慶幸之餘。覺有應誡老數事。第一。言而不行。或行而不澈底。乃國人之通病。對此盛大之兒童節。高呼口號之後。倘無切實之行動繼之。則於事無補。第二。以中國兒童之衆。分布之廣。對於兒童之敎養設施。易有偏倚缺漏之弊。如都市兒童。得有一時之優遇。而散處鄉間及下層民衆之兒童反被遺忘。殊非所以嘉惠全國兒童之本旨。第三。吾人欲造成健全之兒童。必須對兒童之身心各方面。俱有詳密之研究。任何方面。不可使有缺　。故吾人更希望於實際敎餋工作之外。又能有兒童問題研究之運動。（請參閱四卷一號申報月刋「兒童年的兒童問題」一文）。發生於吾國</p>
<p>國人對於世界各國之兒童運動。倘欲有所借鑑效法。美國之兒童年運動。及蘇聯對於兒童之設施。均有一顧之價値。美國之兒童年運動。係由政府勞工部兒童局主持其事。而以國防協會之婦女部任推行之責。參加活動之婦。女爲數達一千一百萬人。除婦女外。尙有無數之大學敎授。敎會牧師。社會事業家。以及圖書館人員等加以協助。其集合全國人民之力量。以圖謀兒童幸福之增進。實足爲吾人效法也。蘇聯對其兒童。則利用全國一切之機會。所有之設備。以增益其知能。如將成人之文化設施。在某一時間內供兒童使用。劇塲電影院俱在上午爲兒童特別開演。工人俱樂部得由兒童利用。公園競技塲爲兒童開放。凡有設施。兒童幾莫不有參加或使用之機會與權利。此又足供吾人參考者也。</p>
<p>抑吾人尤有不能已於言者。兒童之敎餋。端賴成人之知識。如一國之成人。多爲未受敎育者。則欲求兒童有良好之敎養。殊爲困難。我國失學人民。過於半數。此實爲我國敎育上之一個嚴重問題。故吾人言及兒童福利。同時亦不能不聯想及於民衆敎育之需要推廣。蓋社會乃整個之集團。社會程度不提。高而求兒童敎育與兒童福利之提高。亦猶綠木而求魚也。</p>
<p>本報所能努力者。唯在喚起國人。注意兒童權利。故旣先創辦兒童週刋。復於本年兒童節編印「兒童之友。」以爲全國父母敎師對其敎養兒童之一。助更復特約國內兒童敎育專家爲文。列行兒童節紀念冊二十萬份。贈予及本報讀者。希望今後兒童權運動能普遍於全國。以推進兒童文化之建設。語。云衆擎易舉。設國人而能羣起合作。共策進行。豈惟全國兒童之幸。抑亦中華民族無疆之庥也。</p>

<p>華沙艾登今日與波蘭外長只克、及總統莫錫斯基會晤後、晚問復與陸長畢蘇斯基上將談話五十分鐘之久、其地點乃在比爾維地爾宮、兩人皆操法語、畢氏曾闡明波蘭之立塲、尤其爲對東歐軍事互助公約者、今日之談話、並未有何新决議、惟衆信必曾考慮各種建議、且料日後法外長賴伐爾之來遊華沙、似將影響波蘭外交政策之將來發展、波蘭迄今反對東歐公約之一切建議、其對於此事之最後决議、顯有重大關係及於二月三日英法之建議、蓋其中固包括此公約也、據各報意見、波蘭似將在艾登明日離此之前、表明態度、惟其加入公約之條伴、須在倫敦或斯特里薩會議中愼加考慮、此項條件在艾登出發之始、卽已料及、而當時曾切實聲明凡在各都城所徵集之消息、均將於艾登歸國後透澈研究之、今晚貝克欵宴艾登時、波闌要員偕其夫人與宴者頗盛、貝克卽席致詞、歡迎艾登、謂波人對於英政府努力覓求增進國際關係、與鞏固彼此信任之善意、深爲銘　、波蘭願予合作云、艾登答稱、渠信此行必能使英波兩國間有更密切諒解、兩國之政策、皆以集團的安全原則爲根據、並信賴國聯、渠信今雙方所作極友好之談話、極有價値、蓋可使彼此體悉在國際和平組織之大工作中所當盡之義務也云、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>華沙掌爾大臣艾登宣稱、本日午後離華沙前、尙將與法意捷克三國駐波外交代表舉行談話、今晨艾登與波蘭外長柏克曾作第三次談話、明晨可抵捷克京城、與捷克外長貝奈斯舉行談話後、次日卽乘飛機返國、直至目前爲止、局勢并無具體之發展、英國某要人語本社記者謂、「英國終必相信如英國不願自居調人之地位、且直接負其責任、則歐洲持久之和平、必不可得、但爲相互交換起見、歐洲大陸各國、亦必向英國保證、使英本國及其屬地、對於歐洲任何特殊地帶、均不接受特殊約束、總而言之、一切問題、僅在尋求歐洲和平之公式而已」云云、此外英國方面人士、認爲最後解决之方式、不出二種、一則使德國與波蘭除外、由法國與東歐各國簽訂東歐互助公約、但准許德國波蘭於將來加入、二則訂結一種更廣泛之公約、將歐洲各國連同英國包含在內是也、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙波蘭外長貝克與艾登談話時、或曾接受關於東歐洛迦諾公約之任何折衷建議、現信已爲波蘭狄克推多陸長畢蘇斯基所打銷、艾登與貝克之談話、於今日正午後終止、艾登將於今夜起程赴捷克京城柏拉格、而於明晨與捷克外交家討論歐洲之大局、並定明日午後乘飛機返倫敦、星期五日以聘問俄波捷克三國之結果、詳報內閣、艾登與貝克會議旣畢、波蘭當局卽發表公報如下、艾登君曾詳告英國與德國交換意見之情形、外長於雙方和諧之談話中、曾略述波蘭對於二月三日倫敦公報中所列各事及歐洲一般大局之意見、雙方皆以爲此次交換意見、純屬探討性質、已美滿達其目的矣、（三日路透電）</p>

<p>華沙外交部長柏克上校、今晚設宴爲英國掌璽大臣艾登及英國代表團人員洗塵、席次柏克發表簡短演說、歡迎嘉賓、當由艾登答謝、據最可靠之消息、艾登因波蘭似乎不願放棄該國介於德俄之間之地位而加入東歐互助公約、乃將建議以切實裁减軍備爲條件、由歐洲全體國家包括英國在內、訂立互助公約云、本日午前午後艾登曾與柏克兩次會談、晚間拜訪軍政部長畢蘇斯基上將、（二日哈瓦期電）</p>
<p>華沙波蘭官塲因信德國在現有狀况之下、不擬參加東歐公約、故波蘭亦不能卽刻參加云、此項消息、據稱係英國掌　大臣艾登與波蘭外長貝克會議之後所發、並悉波蘭頗願對於任何和平運動參加合作、惟因波蘭處於俄德兩國衝要之地、殊不願簽訂現有方式之公約耳、據稱、貝氏所反對者爲德國如不願參加、卽將被擯一點、因如此、則結果德國將受包團、大槪現在擬議中之公約、德國將不能同意、故波蘭官塲希望加以修改、而波蘭亦須俟修改之後、再定行止、同時艾登仍與貝克繼續會議、法國外長賴伐爾於首途赴俄之時、亦擬在華沙勾留數日、參加討論、觀察者謂無論東歐公約成立與否、賴氏大槪將向蘇俄提出法俄軍事聯盟之切實建議云、（三日國民電）</p>

<p>德國建設議難望贊同</p>
<p>（倫敦）現悉德元首希特勒、上週至柏林與英外相西門、及掌爾大臣、艾登談話時、曾提出代替東歐公約之一種辦法、此項建議、聞係重伸分別締結互不侵略公約之說、而附以對侵略國停止扶助與供給之條文、此種公約最後可載入多方面的互不侵略公約之內、惟據路透社外交訪員之意見、此種辦法、未必爲法俄二國所贊成、因法俄皆國聯會員國、且依據聲明不以戰爭爲國家政策工具之凱洛格公約、早已擔任互不侵略矣、德國所提議者、亦不若國聯盟約第十六條之透澈、蓋此條規定任何國家從事戰爭者、應卽視爲對於國聯其他會員有戰爭行爲而其他各會員將立卽與之斷絕商業上及財政上一切關係也、無論如何、主張東歐公約之法俄二國、必以現有互不侵略辦法目前不足以保障安全爲言（二日路透電）</p>

<p>中央社云、籌備已久之倫敦中國藝術國際展覽會上海預展會、刻已佈置妥善、已定八日開幕、中央社記者昨日走訪該會秘書唐惜分探詢一切、當蒙將足以供吾人參考及借鏡之每屆各國在倫敦所舉行之藝展槪况、及預展會各情詳告、茲特分誌於后、</p>
<p>於今七次</p>
<p>據云、英倫皇家藝術學院之百靈頓堂、近數年來、已先後舉行芬蘭·荷蘭·義大利·波斯·法蘭西·不列顛·等國藝術國際展覽會、本年十一月間、卽將舉行之我國藝展、已為第七次、</p>
<p>舉行目的</p>
<p>考各國之听以不憚其煩、每次在英倫舉辦其規模宏大之國際藝術展覽全、其目的、無大非是在於反映各民族若干年來生活精神之寄托、並表現其創造能力之成績、俾參觀者得以了解各民族之相當地位、由是以促進關係國際之親善、穫致政治經濟乃至商業上之巨量利益、其價值固已有定評、實不容吾人有絲毫之懷疑矣、</p>
<p>歷屆經過</p>
<p>國際藝展之舉辦於英倫、實以芬蘭為竊矢、時為一九二七年、會期約八星期、其次為一九二九年之荷蘭、會期與芬蘭相等、復次為義大利·（一九三零年）波斯·（一九三一年）法蘭西·（一九三二年）及不列顛·（一九三四年）會期或為十個星期、或為九個星期、但所差亦屬無幾、</p>
<p>每次組織</p>
<p>大都以兩國元首為監理·兩國行政領袖爲名譽會長·兩國政界要人及社會名流為名譽委員、此外尚有由發起人及各該國提供展覽物品之主要機關與英皇家藝術學院組成之理事會、藉以執行指揮一切、在理事會下、復設有陳列·財務·選擇·等委員會、辦理各事、同時為廣事徵集展覽物品起見、並在各國、分別設立微求委員會、</p>
<p>經費來源</p>
<p>大都靠門票收入項下收入、票價除星期五為五先令約合華幣七元外、平常俱為一先令六辨士、（約合華幣二元半）每屆藝展所得、除去一切開支、均有盈餘、當義大利舉辦國際藝展時、首相慕沙里尼、曾預撥經費二萬鎊、但結果并未動用分文、且獲三萬七千鎊之盈餘、</p>
<p>出品機關</p>
<p>大抵均以各該國國省辦理之博物院所藏珍品為主、而徵求各國團體及私人之收藏品以補充之、例如波斯所舉辦之國際藝展、即會徵得二百餘博物院圖書館及三十多國之出品、此外私人出品亦有三百餘件、</p>
<p>出品數量</p>
<p>關於出品數量、各國原難盡同、槪言之、則為一千件至二千件、</p>
<p>出品種類</p>
<p>各國藝展出品、種類極繁、且各國亦不盡同、除書盡·銅器·瓷器·玉器·等等之外、尚有陶器·金器·銀器·玻璃器·紡織·木刻·花邊·家具·雕刻等、</p>
<p>出品時代</p>

<p>本埠茂利輪船公司之茂利輪、上次由滬赴海門、至昨日返滬、該輪在海門與亞細亞運油輪相撞、雙方均受損傷、茂利巳停航修理、茲將詳情査誌如下、</p>
<p>碰撞真相</p>
<p>茂利商輪公司茂利輪、於上星期四由滬開往海門黃岩、船內滿載貨客、先到舟山、次駛海門、三月三十日上午四時零五分、給抵海門港面時、有亞細亞火油公司之裝載煤油輪海光號、亦運貨至海交卸、二十九日即到該埠、海光拋在江心、茂利輸抵海門江、昨在深夜正值潮水大漲、又複黑暗異常、海光綸上所懸之前後桅燈、照例前高後低、而該輸則後燈較高、前桅燈低、致茂利為高潮壓逼時、船主急令掉頭、擬向碼頭靠泊、詎當轉身之際、茂利輪經潮力之壓激、船體向海光戤撞、致互受損傷、</p>
<p>損壞狀況</p>
<p>海光油船原拋泊在海門港中、茂利輪掉頭時、致遭互碰、據徐船主對本館記者言、當時茂利輸因係滿船貨客、重　遇潮、在轉頭時遭激烈之高潮所壓、竞無法使船身停留、而不幸有此戤撞之事、當時茂利猶認撞在海光之船尾、不意其桅燈高低適得其反、而撞碰者在海光之船頭左方、損害尚不甚大、茂利輪本身則在右外舷船體之中間、因戤撞海光之船頭、以致鐵板凹進、黑沿截為兩段、但並未破裂據徐船主事後檢騐海光損失、約三四百元、即茂利船體損壞、亦不過七八百元之數、</p>
<p>到滬修理</p>
<p>出事後、茂利船主與海光船長當塲證明碰撞及檢定損壞情形、茂利即停碼頭上起卸貨客、然後再往黄岩、復自海門開還還海、昨日茂利進口後、由徐船主到公司內報告碰撞經過、並由公司轉呈航政局、又函致保險聯合會、請派員到船檢騐損壞狀况、茂利公司為慎重航行起見、已經决定、將茂利輸本日起實行停駛、即進船塢修理、此次茂利輪與海光碰撞、連班期損失、約計三千元左右、貨物乘客、均皆安全、</p>

<p>（華聯社曼谷通訊）在十餘年前、暹政府曾指定某某地劃區實施義務教育、我旅暹華僑、亦隨之規定某某區域爲義務教育區、凡七歲至十四歲之兒童、均應在强迫校內上課、辦理以來、一向無異、不料本年一月十九日、暹羅教育部以實行憲法規定十年教育計劃為詞、通告各華校、着將强迫班、由四月一日起一律停辦、各華校接到此項突如其來之通告、且悉專對華校施、遂紛紛上書暹國務院長及教育部長、請收回成命、仍准各華校强迫班照舊辦理、近聞暹教育部長對於停辦華校强迫班、似欲另覓解决途徑、二月初暹教育部、曾邀請汕頭角光中學校長林天鐸前往會餐、聽取意見、後林氏即於二月底函致暹羅教育部長、供獻繼辦華校强迫班新辦法、其中歷述試行辦法·對暹羅之利益至大、查其該新辦法如下（一）所擬之辦法、在使華校為教育而辦教育、以協助暹政府、並無其他作用於其間、</p>
<p>（二）所擬辦法、在使華校能與暹國法令、及政府行政等不相衝突、故暹國境內所有之華校、苟其能遵照國家規定法制、而納於統治之正軌、且能認眞辦理、輔助國家作育人才為社會謀幸福、雖屬民立、亦仍令其繼辦、</p>
<p>（三）該新辦法、在使政府與華校均免受經濟之損失、因暹國華校之強迫班迫班項停閉、則不獨百餘華校將立即破產、千數百教職員將失業、而政府每年反增加五十萬餘以上教育經費之負擔、對於目下暹羅國家財政、受惡影響甚大、故華校强迫班仍宜維持開辦、</p>
<p>（四）該新辦法、可得華僑之悅服及與論之同情、互該辦法在使中暹兩國增進文化之融洽感情、</p>
<p>（六）所擬辦法、直接關係華僑之職業、間接關係暹羅國家之經濟、故其目的、在適應暹羅社會國家之要求、以栽培在暹華僑之有用人才、比如華僑在暹、多業工商、握國家經濟之中心、然在今日之商塲非通曉暹中英文字語言、實不堪應用、故此新辦法即在對華僑施以適當之教育、即對於華僑事業之發展、亦不為有利、且對於暹羅國家經濟之來源、亦與以好影響、</p>

<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>中國古之治理。教養兼施。育幼養老。　所重視。誠以兒童有敏慧之天資。純潔之天良。活潑之天性。其智·其德·其體·均在成人之上。誠能教之養之。各得其方。自易蔚爲社會之長才。改進民族之質素。</p>
<p>近世各國政治革新之均勢。對於人民生活之保育。備極注意。而於兒童生活·兒童權利·且予以憲法的保障。如戰後德國新憲　其顯例也　德憲第一二二條規定曰。「對於兒童之過勞。以及道德上精神上身體上之怠棄。當加以保護。聯邦等公共團體。對此當爲必然之措置。」其次如九二條及一二零條　又有關於家庭衛生。以及義務教育之規定。至於各方勞動法典。對於兒童之保護更爲周密。如工作年齡。工作時間。教育程度。身體康健諸項。莫不於法律爲嚴密而特別的限制與愛護。</p>
<p>吾國先哲對於兒童問題。初未漠視。如曰。「男有分。女有歸。壯有所用。鰥寡孤獨廢疾者。皆有所養。」又曰。「老吾老。以及人之老。幼吾幼。以及人之幼。」其愛護兒童注意兒童之精神　概可想見。惜乎晚近以來。教化廢馳。非但國家社會。漠視兒童。甚至身爲父母師長者。亦均不知其教養之責任。羣居終日。言不及義。行爲放浪。心身日壞。兒童爲將來民族之精魂。國家之基石。長此以往。不加注意。則其所貽國家民族之患。何堪設想。</p>
<p>今逢兒童節紀念之日。適承微稿於愚　因就公餘。略布所感。深望今之從事於兒童運動者。對於兒童生活。兒童衛生。兒童福利等。加以切實注意與研究。俾活潑純潔敏慧的無數兒童。均不致爲惡劣環境所腐化。而蔚然爲國家社會之長才。則其有裨於民族前途者。何可言量哉。</p>

<p>老子說：「移風易俗始終漸」社會風氣爲制定國運之依據，風俗之成，成於潛移默化，則其去也，自非一朝一夕之功，社會改造之基點，在於改造民族的生活，生活之方式合宜，則其生理上，心理上於不知不覺中，即能趨於軌範，而一善良社會，於是乎形成！</p>
<p>依學習心理學試騐的結果，人類活動除其本能外，而能表演於社會之各種行動，乃由於習慣的作用，習慣一經造成其爲善也，終身享受，其爲惡也，矯正頗非易易，所以談到移風易俗，不得不注重習慣的養成，成人的習慣，既不易改變，那麼兒童時期的生活，教養，培植種種，適應社會，同時來改良社會的優美習慣，應爲吾人之重大使命！</p>
<p>現在兒童受社會不良習慣的影響，處處現出偷安，取巧頹廢，消極，散漫，自私之惡習，數十年來，新教育的失敗，亦即社會紛擾不安之所由來，維今以往，吾人應於兒童教育上下功夫，以使其有創造，服務，奮鬥，勞動之信念，及忠貞，刻苦，仁俠，尚義之精神，此種信念和精神，應使其於日常生活上，逐漸訓練，培成習慣，而自守勿失，今日之兒童，即未來之成人，吾人注意社會改造，不能不植基於蓬勃之兒童時期的一切生活上。</p>

<p>全國親愛的小朋友們：</p>
<p>今天，該是你們最快活的一天了，因爲第五屆兒童節又在今天到來了！</p>
<p>兒童節的意義，是該分成兩方面來說的，一方面，因爲我們中國人素來不注意小朋友的幸福，所以要產生兒童節來提倡；一方面，因爲我們中國的小朋友，素來不知道自己地位的重要，所以要產生兒童節來促使小朋友自己覺悟。</p>
<p>成人不注意兒童幸福的提倡，固然對不起小朋友；小朋友不知道，自己地位的重要，那便是對不起自己！要知道：你們是國家的寶貝，未來的國家，都要由你們來扶植維持，如果你們不知道所處地位的重要，不努力去做完責任，那便不但對不起自己，而且也對不起國家了。</p>
<p>小朋友，在我們，已知道你們地位的重要，認定你們是國家的寶貝了，所以，從今以後，我們要努力謀兒童幸福的促進；而你們呢，也該知道自己地位的重要，努力完成你們的責任。</p>
<p>小朋友，來，你們爲自己努力，我們爲你們努力，我們來共同努力吧！</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>絲綸垂約。在我們中國，素來是不算一回傖俗的事的。在歷史上最是有名，而且是相傳數千年，還是十分膾炙人口的，有姜太公釣魚的故事。其次如浙西的嚴子陵釣魚臺，是那麼的使人流連景仰。至於名曲「老漁翁」，更不知有若干萬人傳誦歌拍過。雖然自從新式的歌舞團，奪去了那支名曲的地位之後，「老漁翁」是不常再掛在一般人的嘴角兒上了，但是那悲涼鬱勃的調子，還可以不時在街頭巷尾聽聞到。</p>
<p>不錯，在古代的中國，掛冠掛印，退隱歸田，於是乎左手持酒盃，右手持釣竿，在烟波淼渺之中，找尋詩料的也有，文塲不利，或是仕途蹭蹬，一肚子的鬱抑牢騷，無處發洩，於是乎找一處溪頭水角，垂着一個魚竿，消磨歲月，兼藉以忘愁却恨的也有。所以在藝術家筆下的水畫幅中，點綴上一個漁罷歸來，或正在垂釣的老漁翁，也就能益發的詩情畫意，活躍紙上了。</p>
<p>但是，橘逾淮而變枳，釣魚這一回事，也是如此。因爲絲綸垂釣，在我們中國，是雅人深致的一種玩意兒，可是在外國，却變成了一種測探港灣深淺，水流緩速的間諜工作了。</p>
<p>前者是點綴湖山，何等的恬靜，後者是準備流血，滿含着殺氣。同是釣魚，性質竟如此互異，這真是從那裏說起呢？</p>
<h3 id="c237">春寒 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>誰都謳歌着春的來臨，天上的雲那樣淡蕩，河中的水那樣溫柔，桃花笑着，楊柳舞着，就是馬路上娘兒們，也卸脫了黑茸茸的獸皮大氅，換了薄的新衫，刺探那東風適可的新涼。不用說，龍華道上的黃塵，曾爲輕盈的馬蹄飛盪，各地桃林的香韻，曾爲尋詩的伴侶舒放着雅馴的氤氳，而文人們的筆尖，在原稿紙上，容易地溜出「春天了」那些刻板的句子。</p>
<p>可是春天也如一個漂亮的姑娘，眉兒在笑，眼兒在語，嘴角邊透露着嫵媚，手臂上寫出春情；但有時候伊也會歛住了活潑的姿態，作出嚴肅的樣子；故而人們企望着晴暖的春天，爲了一塲雪，一塲雨，一夜風吹，重復轉入殘冬苦寒的氣節。使受不住陰凍的花花葉葉，一眨眼辭枝飄零，委地成塵的悲運，終於避免不掉。看！女兒們不全在箱底裏翻出剛收拾好的重裘厚氅？</p>
<p>滿以爲溫暖屬於自己時，得回頭看一看涼冷正躡在後面，待機襲來！</p>
<p>遊春的伴侶，正從都市向各地山川去索取精神的糧食，誰都在笑渦裏注着醇厚的逸興，然而淡雲微日的天氣，黃昏時一聲鳩鳴，得預防明晨枕上，夢醒來却是掃興的雨聲喲。</p>
<p>不要討厭冬天的皮衣蠢重，不要恣情只帶着新製的春衫；偶然的寒冷，會告訴你們在旅行常識之外的一種人生哲學！</p>

<p>第十一回　夜話凄涼生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺人</p>
<p>依着他今日所說的話而論，他過的這種生活，是不應該有笑容的。縱然對人有笑容，其實那也不是笑容，而是在對人哭。社會上誰能看出別人笑臉是哭？所以笑中帶哭的人，一輩子只有笑中帶哭的了。這一晚上燈昏屋暗，風吹戶動，也不知道楊賈二人是誰哭誰笑。不過到了次日，楊浣花衣袋裏，有了三塊錢，他是比較的得了一點安慰。在西安這個都會裏，還能够看出一些西北人刻苦精神來的，便是天色一亮，市民都起來了。若是在春天以後，睡過八點鐘還不曾起床，這人必然有些異狀。這天楊浣花睡到九點鐘，方是醒過來，虛掩着的房門，被風吹得大開，涼習習的，連睡的帳子，也有些飄蕩。浣花立刻伸出頭來，向外面看着，只見窗子外面，天色是陰沉沉的。彷彿太陽還不曾出土。浣花想着，自己好像是睡得很熟，應當有更長的時間，何以天色還不曾出太陽呢？正凝神着，被冷風嗆住了嗓子，不覺連連咳嗽了兩聲。茶房在門外伸頭張望了一下，就輕輕的呌了一聲道：楊小姐，該起來了，已經是九點多鐘了。浣花道：哦！九點多了，天下雨了嗎？茶房道：斜風細雨，昨天是鬧了一晚上，你一點不知道嗎？浣花一面披衣起床，一面笑道：我真是一點都沒有覺得。隔壁屋子裏的賈先生，起來了沒有？茶房笑道：他同你一樣，也是睡得很着。浣花立刻穿好了衣服，呌茶房送茶水進來。茶房進進出出，總是望了他微笑。（一七三）</p>

<p>我可以說：無論什麼小的，或不顯明的東西，要逃過太后的眼光是絕不容易的。所以我覺得每次隨侍着太后的頤和園中閑逛，總可以得到許多新的啟示；因爲一路行來，伊只須隨便看看，便立刻可以看出許多不適當的佈置，或應該添補上的缺漏來了。經伊一指明之後，這些不適當的佈置，或缺漏，便必須馬上移去或補上；不然的話，那個負責管理的人便有大禍臨頭了。</p>
<p>啊！你們試想，那麼一方石坪裏，滿　着幾百絞深紅淺綠的彩絲，該是多麼的美麗啊？多麼的可愛啊？再加排列得又是非常的整齊，紅的一行，黃的一行，藍的一行；遠遠地望去，真像天上的虹一樣。那些女孩子們便在這一條一條的虹中，穿來穿去的走動着。伊們是不敢一刻稍離的；因爲這些絲時常需要人去翻動它們，以免感光太久或不足。若得曬得不好，那就不能用，連先前所費的許多繅洗刷染的工夫，也等於白費。不過曬後的成績是好是壞，我們外行的人很不容易辨別得出，除掉這些以製絲爲專業的小姑娘而外，惟有我們那位敏慧多能的太后，才有這種超人的眼力。（二八四）</p>

<p>一個經過許多挫折，受過重大刺激的余三，從牢獄中釋放出來，很想改變人生，重新來奮鬥一番，可是。等到他回到故居的時候，已經妻子離散，景物全非的了，於是，他衹好流浪，在茫茫的塵海中，去尋找他的骨肉和愛侶。</p>
<p>爲求生活的安定，無意間恰巧碰到了從前的一個朋友，就薦他在一家銀行中的金庫間去做聽差，那裏會知道眼前的管金庫的就是他自己的兒子呢。</p>
<p>後來日子長了，它慢慢地從懷疑而證實，才明白了一切，他的二十年前的老友，已經姦佔了他的愛妻發了財做了這家銀行的經理，兒子呢，就是金庫的主任，可是，他已經把人生改變了，他並不說穿，仍舊做他的奴僕生活。</p>
<p>有一天，金庫主任解欵到外埠去，被一批用女人來勾引做線頭的匪徒所算計，余三竟會奮不顧身的去把解欵從匪徒手中奪回來，那裏知道反而遭捕者的槍殺了。</p>
<p>這是一部有西片「亡命者」作風的明星出品「人倫」新片中片叚的故事，片中對於「父愛」的描寫，實在能够曲盡其道的。不久的將來，該片就要在本埠新光戲院裏公映，愛觀粗線條作風的觀者們，很值得去一看的。</p>

<p>越中山水，秀甲東南，此次王曉籟，王延松，裴雲卿，三君發起春游團，邀滬杭各界摯友，赴紹遊覽，二十六日上午渡江，二十七日下午回杭，爲期雖僅兩日，飽覽名勝不少，山陰道上，應接不暇，爰將斯遊情況，略誌如下：</p>
<p>抵紹時，因綢業銀行紹興分行是日開幕，百餘人同往道賀，將所備之冠生園茶點，吃得盆底向天。十一時分乘汽車至東湖，備有小舟，蕩漾湖中，經仙桃陶公洞，仰觀高巖，有對峙如門者，有孤立倒懸者，水色深碧，如坐井中。在水樂　宴飲後，乘汽車至樊江站，復乘舟赴吼山，沿途風景絕佳。同行中如黃賓虹謝公展王濟遠等藝術家，隨處寫生，獲稿頗富，至烟蘿洞，王曉籟氏新建之傅巖小築內品茗，面山臨水，幽雅絕倫。旁有雲石墩，凌空兀立，頂立於柱，常有雲氣環繞，與雲石墩對峙者曰棋枰石，瘦削孤立十餘丈，上有橫石覆之，形如棋枰。旋赴對河畏盧，係明陶蘭亭先生讀書處，與陶文簡公石簣山房故址相對。洞內豁然開朗，洞嶼錯峙，有若蟾蜍，有如象鼻，頗有武陵源景象。盧主沈克明氏，出所藏書畫以示同人，令人愛不釋手。傍晚回城，綢業銀行分經理借商會公宴，宴畢分寓鑑湖龍山兩旅社。次日雇舟，由輪船拖帶至禹陵，廟係新修，宏壯勝前。大禹神象，執圭直立，長約丈餘，令人肅然起敬，僉脫帽鞠躬。在殿前請團友冠真照相館主任孫君合攝一影，乃至菲飲泉窆石亭等處參觀，泉水清澈，川流不息，競相掬飲，味甚甘冽。亭有石紐，高五尺餘，據云係治水之器，經人撫摩，光滑而有紅筋，宛似漢玉。廟左有碑，章太炎所撰，詳述大禹治水之功，與此次重修之經過情形，有『茍中夏不滅，德廣所及，恍於神州，百世莫得與比』等語。午後赴縣商會之宴，爲留紀念起見，公推七十一歲之黃賓虹氏作序，謝公展王濟遠等繪圖，題曰：『修禊嗣音，』而列叙時人姓名。紹興近三年來，開闢街道，改善橋樑，交通便利，商業日繁，頗有蓬勃氣象。同一府城，我禾雖名稱上亦有一興字，但新興事業，不及紹興達甚。傍晚回杭，覺齒頰猶芬，蓋此次宴飲之菜，均係珍品，如雞腰，係閹雞之腎，味嫩鮮美，喜蛋一名攢雲龍，即孵化一半成雛，而未生毛之活蛋，他處所無，確係紹興特菜云。</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今天是舉國一致奉行的『兒童節』。記者覺得在『兒童節』中，來談談兒童與提倡國貨運動的關係，也是一件很有意義的事。於是，便抓住了這個題目，發表一些淺溥的見解如下：</p>
<p>我們知道，兒童是國家的未來主人翁，是社會將來的柱石，我們中華民國的未來的國運如何，完全要現在的兒童，負起責任來，尤其要希望負教育兒童責任的家長們，以及學校中的教師們，在現在預先負起這個訓育的責任來，那末，才有莫大的希望，這是大家都明白的一些簡單理由，誰都不會加以否認的。</p>
<p>現在，姑且撇開了别的問題不談，就以提倡國貨運動而論，我以為大部份的責任，也要由兒童們負起，因爲兒童的心理，是純潔的，兒童的感情，是熱烈的，在純潔的心理熱烈的感情的兒童方面，灌輸提倡國貨的教育，訓練服用國貨的習慣，我相信：他的成績是非常偉大而有效的，因此，我熱忱的希望，注意兒童教育的先生們，在這一點上，也要切切實實的來用一些工夫才好。</p>
<p>今年是各團體公定的『學生國貸年』，兒童是學生的一份子，對於提倡國貨的責任，自然比往年更來得重大，然而，兒童的一切行動，可以說大部份是被動的，成人們呌他怎樣，他便怎樣，響如拿購買用品來講，成人們喜歡到外國洋貨店中去買，兒童有什麽權力來組上他呢？卽使明白購買洋貨的不應該，也只好自己心裏明白，所以，我們要訓練兒童購買中國貨，第一步工作，先要做父兄師保的人，做出好榜樣來，給他看，那才有效，不過，口頭說說，而言行矛盾的事實上的表現，而欲收提倡國貨的效果，那是微乎其微的，所以我希望在今天舉國一致奉行的『兒童節』裏，一方面把要提倡國貨的意義，購用國貨的理由，宣傳國貨的方面，一項一項的解釋給可愛可親的兒童們知道，使兒童們知道提倡國貨，服用國貨，是兒童本身應做的工作，應盡的義務，這個觀念一養成之後，兒童對於國貨，便有了一個深刻的認識，將來長大成人之後，自然能達到非國貨不穿，非國貨不用，非國貨不吃的目的了，到了這個時候，我們中國的國貨運動，便能達到偉大的成功偉大的成續了。</p>
<p>謹利用今天的『兒童節』的機會，誠懇的貢獻一些我的意見，請大家注意一下，來替國貨運動做些工作吧。</p>

<p>白駒過隙、一年一度的兒童節、又已來到！兒童、是國家未來的主人翁、誰都知道的，兒童是天眞爛漫！一條純潔的絲紹、染於蒼則蒼，染於黃則黃！父母和師長，應該如何啟迪他們上正軌，那是最緊要的，今年是「兒童年」，也就是已定的「學生國貨年」，許多小學生，誰都不是兒童？種瓜得瓜！種豆得豆！我們國貨界，應如何利用這「兒童節」的機會！養成兒童們從小愛玩國貨的習性！中國國貨公司在這春氣蓬勃的佳節，舉行兒童播音競選，眞是善於利用機會者，我希望其他國貨商塲，也多多發起兒童聯歡會，兒童遊藝會，兒童演講會，使許多小天使！踴躍參加！誰的國貨印象深而誰的演講有中心思想，就獎勵他們！或半價推銷兒童用品一天！這：要看國貨界會不會利用此大好兒童節，為「國貨」二字，留一個種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆，造成將來的美滿收成啊！</p>

<h3 id="c246">一首白話詩 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>兒童，兒童，要記到國難重重。民虛財盡，國力巳窮。</p>
<p>一批舶來貨物、把白銀搬運一空。漫怨年凶，漫責老農，千不是，萬不該，把摩登兩字太流通，你要時髦，我要出鋒，倒使那外貨的傾銷成功。</p>
<p>今年是學生國貨年，莫再痴聾。</p>
<p>小朋友一齊起來。努力加功。</p>
<p>從今後吃的穿的用的，非國貨莫從。</p>
<p>逢人勸導，到處警鐘，挽回國力，復興民族，端賴兒童。</p>
<p>這一首白話詩，是區區在學生國貨年的兒童節，特地做了來念給小朋友聽的，小朋友，都是很有志氣的，很有決心的。吾家的八歲女兒，自從告訴地要用國貨以後，她逢到穿衣時侯，必問媽媽是不是中國貨？吃物時侯，必問媽媽這是不是外國貨？如果聽說是外國貨，她便不穿不吃，並且大發脾氣，直要到買到中國貨才休。人同此心，心同此理，推想起來，我知一般小朋友都是如此的。所以做父母的，如果把這首詩念給他們聽聽，他們一定歡天喜地的愿意領受過來，擔了這副責任在他小肩子上。正是欲求國貨飛黃日，全仗兒童立志堅。</p>

<h3 id="c247">記無敵香皂廠開幕禮 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 亦敏</p>
<p>—不景氣聲中的一個好消息—</p>
<p>無敵香皂廠開幕了！在這工商業鬧着極度不景氣的年頭，有這樣一件比較差强人意的事來給大家興奮興奮，大槪還不能說是多事。</p>
<p>在未談開幕之前，應該先講一講這廠的由來。</p>
<p>看到「無敵香皂」四字，我相信讀者一定會聯想到「無敵牙粉」。是的，這無敵香皂廠，便是由無敵牙粉的發明人天虛我生先生所辦之家庭工業社和翁榮炳先生合資創辦的，翁先生是製皂專家，家庭工業社也有添製香皂的意思，於是，無敵皂廠就很順利的誕生了。</p>
<p>這廠設於江　區的西體育會路廠　是新建的，是一座新式的雙層建築，下層是製造部和貨棧，上層是包裝間。在舉行開幕之前，我跟招待員去跑了一趟，因為時間太短促，而且我又是門外漢，所以像劉姥姥進了大觀園似的，覺得樣樣都新奇，但樣樣都不懂。不過據領導我參觀的人說，那些機械都是最新式的，當時侯，我的確感到像已收複了東北失地似的那麽喜悅！</p>
<p>那天到的來賓，大約在五百人以上，其中有女賓，而且還有外賓——西洋人，　所謂濟濟一堂，盛極一時。先由天虛我生先生揭幕，並作簡單的報告，其次是吳市長代表李大超氏致訓詞，和四五位來賓的演說，下面，是我記憶中還沒有消失的一些片斷。</p>
<p>最令人注意的，要算天虛我生先生。那天，陳先生眞高典，他春風滿面地在明媚的春光中，散出春一般的氣息。他歉和地請來賓對於該廠出品要隨時指教，他更興奮地期望中國將不再有外國香皂。總之，那天的陳先生，眞的彷彿已恢復了他的靑春。</p>
<p>李大超代表吳市長的訓詞，自然是值得注意的，他對於無敵廠的建立，除了認為與繁榮市中心區有着莫大關係，因此感到欣慰外，並表示市政府一定可以給該廠以種種便利與贊助！</p>
<p>在來賓演說中，上海機製國貨工廠聯合會總幹事程守中先生的話，也是值得記一記的。第一，他用怪有趣的口吻，預測無敵皂廠必有無限的發展，理由一是：天虛我生先生為國內有數的工業界一老前輩；翁先生是中國不可多得的製皂一專家，現在他們二位合作，眞所謂牡丹一綠葉，相得益彰，從此，中國市塲上將不再有舶來香皂，那是可以預卜的。其一次，他認為無敵廠設備的完善，機械之新頴，以及採料之認眞，在國內尚不多　，這在今日的工業界，應該是一件可喜的事。第三，他對於無敵廠的設立在華界，更表示同情，因為租界雖也是我們的領土，但在目前，仍還處處受他們的節制，所以無敵廠設在江　區，他認為至少有兩種意義：在消極方面，是可以避免租界上的種種無理牽制；在積極方面，是帮助政府完成閘北的繁榮。</p>
<p>「國……貨……」，汽笛在發出像高呼國負似的回聲來了。我們便在這「　貨」的回聲中，走出了「國貨」的無敵皂廠。</p>
<h3 id="c248">快造國貨新文具 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>誰也不能否認的，帝國主義在我國市塲上的「經濟侵略」，可謂無微不至，盡「搜括」「榨取」的能事了，我們知道，在歷年龐大的入超中，有整批的糧食，大量的呢絨，人造絲等……但，大家總像很糢糊的，不知在這裏邊，還有數百萬元的舶來文具—這日常一般智識分子所消耗的用品，也同樣地是無孔不入的流入整個社會，這是如何可怕的事實，今年為「學生國貨年」，而這教育上最重要的文具問題，我們該如何設法彌補這缺憾，消滅這數字，自是本年度一件最重要的工作。</p>
<p>不過。我們在現階段上應先注意的，就是時代的趨向，是在不斷地演進，一個社會所需要的物品，也在適應某種需要而改易，所以，在目下，我國有許多新的文具，因還不能自造，能設法避免而服用國貨，果為最好，但，事實决不這樣簡單，舊的毛筆，徽墨，已在各個特殊情形上，趨於淘汰，像國貨廠商，公司所用的發票，尚須鉛筆和複寫紙，學校中的上英文班，又豈能以毛筆替代，在這種事實的需要上，我們因此，可很堅定的喊出「快創造國貨新文具」的呼號來。</p>
<p>據我所知，國貨廠商對於新文具已能自造者，已有大華鉛筆，民生廠的紅藍墨水，潘仰堯先生去年主辦的中南工業社，尤首先創製鋼筆筆桿，美觀堅牢，遠勝舶來，此種當然都為國貨文具前途最好的現象，尚能繼續努力，埋頭幹去，目下雖然新文具尚未完備，（如筆尖，紙張等恐倘無國貨代替品），但，最近的將來，總可遠到我們的願望的。</p>
<p>總之，我們對於文具問題，現下可有這樣一個結論，「我們在可能範園內，務須儘量服用國貨，並努力提倡新的國貨文具，但，我們尚有希望者，要熱烈企望各國貨先進界速定整個計劃，創製新的國貨文具，以適應社會需要，再不要遲疑觀望，而坐待外人的「經濟宰割」了，</p>

<p>說到這裏，一定有人會懷疑到，無貝之才，怎麼能幫助呢，還應該研究到最需要的，那幾種無貝之才，依我說來，第一，任何企業，事前的計劃最要緊說不定成功或失敗的根苗，老早在營業計劃中間種下了，不過有了合理的計劃，還要依照計劃切實地去施行，設或發見情勢有變化，還應該趕緊把計劃來修改，臂之打仗，要勇敢，還得要有智謀，第二，旣然，工作目的屬於營業那麽關係數目字的紀錄和核算必須準確，這就是會計的重要了，有許多工商機關，會計是馬馬虎虎的，因為會計沒有辦的淸楚，所以賺錢不一定知道賺錢的所在，賠本也不知道為十麼賠本，而舞弊尤為容易，這種情形簡直勝利是偶然的，失敗倒是必然的，假如有人貸款與錢，而沒有注意到我所定計劃的不合理與我的不依計劃施行，貸欵助我營業，而沒有注意到我所采會計制度的馬馬虎虎，這樣貸，，無異於浪费，更無異於對受貸者故意增益其無從還貸的債務，我以為如果很卑狹地以放債為目的，除掉放債以外，可以一切不問，現在旣以救濟為目的，則一方面帮助人家資本，至少同時須顧問人家兩點即營業根本條件，計劃究竟怎樣，營業主要工具，會計合式不合式，這是善意的帮助人家，萬不該誤會到別種意思上去的，我們放大了眼光看來，眞要挽救中國的危機必須上自政府，下至社會，各種組織一一趨向健全　成整固的國力，　配和敵人抵抗司時機有資格配科人家親善，而一想到各國經濟侵略的危害我國家到這般地步，對外貿易年年入超至幾萬萬元，從羅地網中怎樣殺出一條生路，惟有根本上把全國工商業整理起來，帮助他們使成健全的組織，每個工廠商一店，有健全的組織；每種工商業，有建全的組織，整個工商業，有健全的組織，製造纔得精良，或本纔得减輕運輸纔得實話，銷路纔得推廣工商業纔有生機國家也繼有生命，可是要帮助工商業，必得找個適當的機會纔行，這時候正是機適當的機會呀！</p>

<h3 id="c251">在兒童節對於兒童幸福的展望 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 鍾元</p>
<p>二十世紀是由女權運動而達到兒童權利擴展的一世紀，愛倫凱簡直稱「兒童世紀」。這從各國提倡兒童幸福的呼聲和促進各種兒童幸福事業的組成可以證明的。在中國既有兒童節兒童年的規定，同時各地也有兒童幸福會和慈幼事業的組織。這一切現象，可說是世界兒童幸福運動的高潮中澎湃的一浪。浪花的翻騰，不過是顯現着流水的浮面現象的一面。至於在水底的那些淤泥沉滯，雜石橫亙。這是欣賞江潮的人們所常忽視的。但，在事實上積淤不通雜石不除，則水流終不能充暢的瀉洩，而那些所謂潮浪也衹不過是曇花的一現而已。中國兒童幸福運動似乎可以這樣象徵着。</p>
<p>在事馬喧鬧的都市之中，每逢兒童節日，這一個機關舉行着嬰兒健康比賽；那一個塲所專爲兒童開放，無代價的供給娛樂，有些展覽着幸福兒童的教　用具；有些饋贈着兒童們甜蜜的糖果。所以這一天在街市上，在娛樂塲裏，在主辦或兼辦着兒童教養事業的機關裏，我們都可遇到成羣結隊的兒童。他們的面龐上所表現的無不「笑容可掬」，「興高彩烈」。於是一般成年的人們都贊羨着這時代的兒童果真的得着無量的幸福，這是兒童幸福運動中的一面，也即是幸福運動中幸福人們習見的一面。</p>
<p>在另一面是怎樣呢？我先得介紹我親見的事實：</p>
<p>「……薄暮，出校晚餐，行經太石橋畔，忽聞一挑担者呌賣聲，其音凄楚而所賣物名似非夙稔，同行者就與之語，始知所呌賣者即賣小孩也。路客有叩其所賣之性別者，賣者對曰：「男者有，女者亦有」，蓋其所挑之籮，前者盛其子而後者盛其女也。或憐其情，授之錢，勸令兩兒童俱歸者，賣者泣謝。謂其田盧淹沒，妻室溺亡，若出賣兩兒，猶得乞食以生，否則將相守以待斃矣。……」十八年三月十五日記</p>
<p>這種出賣人口的事實，在前幾年大連泰東日報也曾載：「興平，武功，醴泉……等處竟有設人市。夫携其妻，父帶其女，入市求售。人販評貨作價，買之一空。」當然不僅是一地一時的現象。</p>
<p>整個的農村經濟崩潰到尖銳化的時候，農民們已出賣了土地，出賣了傢具，最後再賣妻　子。子女被賣者或爲奴或爲婢或爲雛妓。在這裏，我們所看到的，惟有兒童的哀聲，不見有兒童的幸福。</p>
<p>每天東方剛顯着魚白色的曙光時，無情的工廠汽笛已發出緊急集合的號令了。那些上工去的成年工人隊伍當中，參加着許多兒童同行。他們雖貪戀着酣甜的睡鄉，他們雖需要着充足的睡眠。但這時衹好擦一擦惺忪的倦眼，趕忙的走向廠去，至於在廠裏的生活，據勞動年鑑所載一家毛綫廠裏的藝徒生活如下：</p>
<p>「以正在發育之兒童，每日工作十三至十四小時，起居飲食，惡劣不堪。屋內羊毛塵屑，滿布室中。藝徒有肺病及眼膜結粒炎者，已居多數……既未受過教育，又無機會讀書。雖有慈善團體，竭力提倡，使每日有一小時或二小時得受普通教育，卒因業主反對，無從實現。」</p>
<p>在中國一九三〇年工廠法中，雖已有「未滿十四歲的男女，在工廠法公布前已在工廠工作者，應於工廠法施行兩個月內將該工人姓名籍貫年齡入廠日期工作種類入工作性質呈請主管官署核展期限。」的限期。但大多數廠家都是陽奉陰違，何嘗能體息到童工的疾苦呢？所以在大部分因家庭經濟壓迫而去工廠做工的兒女。他們衹有疾病苦痛的襲擊，不見有歡愉的笑樂。</p>
<p>十字街頭常有一些兒童　躅遊蕩，垃圾箱旁每來許多小孩拾尋荒貨。人們有時詛咒說這些兒童必是不明識字的重要或者是性行頑劣不堪造就的。這未免有些冤枉了。因爲現在的學校實在是「屹宮牆之數仭」高不可攀的。尤其辦理較優良的小學，每年用費多至數十元的，而報名入學的時候如其沒有和學校當局相熟者的關託或關託的不力，仍就是「望其門牆」，無機受教。十九年教育部統計中國學齡兒童四千一百萬。入學者爲七百萬而失學者爲三千四百萬。這樣大部分的兒童摒除在文化熏陶之外了。文化的享受是人生幸福的源泉，中國大部分兒童既然如此，所以他們衹有日趨愚昧的可憐，不見有智識水準的權利。</p>
<p>上述這一切伴隨着經濟關係而產生的畸形現象。當着社會演進到現階段上尤其是『更僕難數』的。要之，都是代表着兒童幸福運動的陰面。這陰面的事實，等於流水中的積淤雜石。它阻障着整個兒童幸福運動的展進。</p>
<p>如果，我們所提倡着的運動，不僅爲疼愛蘋果似的小臉，活潑潑地，不僅在求得英才，喜其『孺子可教』，不僅在『克振家聲』以『光耀門楣』，而注目到整個中國兒童的教養扼住着中國整個民族精神的發揚。那末，我們首先所應注意的便不在佇望着潮頭向它鼓掌喝采，而要設法把阻亙流水的積淤雜石疏除搬運。</p>
<p>二四，四四。</p>
<h3 id="c252">月 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 耶草</p>
<p>春日的暖和依然是往年那麼的。</p>
<p>但是黃莊却不像以前一樣了！</p>
<p>往年的春天裏，那曠塲的南端，座落在交叉路口的土帝廟，總是有着熱鬧的香火會的，人蜂一樣的，一羣羣，擁擠着，彷彿在愉快的境遇裏游泳，大家全有着一顆難以形容的歡樂的心。老婆子牽住她孫子，從遙遠的塲合拐來趕會；娘們兒平素是少出大門的，這會兒是在對着鏡子擦胭脂，給自己的女兒紥個紅辮梢，然後，帶着長凳，三五個一起，是那麼不大方的　出去了。</p>
<p>可是如今的黃莊呢？</p>
<p>經過兩年災荒的襲擊，對於生活，人們再也無法抵禦了，一種建築在飢饉上的恐怖，使年輕人對於他們的家是沒有了留戀，他們開始逃亡，到那理想的福地去！</p>
<p>一天天地，年輕　　　多溜盡了，剩下的是不願離開家鄉的老頭和老婆，還有他們幼小的孩兒，當年輕人善意地忠告他們，久獃在家鄉會挨餓的時候，黃老爹提高了喉嚨，粗聲粗氣的嚷道：</p>
<p>「那麼容易嗎？你們也應當着實想想呵，家產雖說少，總是祖上傳下來的，走了，你還到那兒去弄啊！」</p>
<p>「不走，喫什麼啊，喝風嗎！」</p>
<p>「哼！小子！樹皮，不可能喫嗎？還有樹葉子。」</p>
<p>「唏！」年輕人着急的唏噓着。</p>
<p>任管老人怎樣的固執，這些年輕人終於一個個離開了他們的家。</p>
<p>老人們在殘喘的日子內茍延着，每天喫一餐—那樹皮屑和麪粉煮成的稀粥，跟他們的孫兒。生活是久的，然而樹皮却有喫盡的光景；這，首先，引起了老人們的驚慌。</p>
<p>人終竟是聰慧的，往往在不能解決的問題到來時，會設想出解決的辦法來。有天老婆子掃興地看着黃老爹：</p>
<p>「樹皮喫完了怎麼辦哪？」</p>
<p>「喫樹葉呵。」</p>
<p>「葉子也採完了呢？」</p>
<p>「水藻呵，河裏多得很，人家全不知道哩！」</p>
<p>是的，又過了多少日子以後，黃老爹帶了一包水藻回來了。他走路特別有勁兒，露出了數月來不曾見過的笑顏；他，是仁慈而又可憐的，在他的心裏，似乎感到很是得意，至少家裏人這番可以吃一頓飽，因爲他手中是有那麼一大包。</p>
<p>不幸的是第二天一家人全腫得頸子和臉一般粗，舌子僵了似的，說話怪費事。一個孫兒天真地呌着：</p>
<p>「奶奶呵，你的臉像個月亮，圓的，爺爺也是的；怎麼啦？」</p>
<p>「嗯！」她輕輕地嗯了句，緊咬着抖索的下唇。</p>
<p>水藻是有毒的！</p>
<h3 id="c253">曹娥江畔 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 千冬</p>
<p>有五年了。五年前，我是懷着怎樣的心境渡過這條曹娥江的呢？憶念起來，真有今昔之感！</p>
<p>是一個冬天的早晨罷，太陽剛剛笑了一笑，一會兒天又陰沉下來，風比猛獸還要兇惡，恐怖地吼着。</p>
<p>走到江畔，天開始下雨，也開始下雪啦。泥路非常濘滑，一不小心，便會跌交呀。渡頭在雨色下孤獨地沒有響聲，風和雨雪奏着寂寞的小曲，曹娥江的夜緩緩地唱着流亡者的哀歌，我們是怦着比流亡者更傷感的情緒模糊地渡過這條小江了。</p>
<p>現在，江畔的桃花是盛開了，楊柳已經抽出嫩綠的新芽，淡黃色的江水不斷地向東流注，金色的太陽滿山滿水都是。而我呢，我却還是懷着五年前所有的傷感的情緒渡過曹娥江了。</p>
<p>我讓我的視線極自由地搜索，我想在這個小小的世界裏探尋五年間的幻變的痕跡；可是，我失望了，我看不出五年間有什麼變動。人們仍舊熙熙攘攘，划着划子，汲着江水，挑夫還是成羣地拿着粗担子用醉醺醺的臉向我示意：「要挑不？」沿岸的呌賣者仍然嘈雜地呌喊着，小飯店裏進進出出好像還是那一班開口就罵「媽篤　屄」的紹興佬，甚至連江灘上耍石彈子的小孩子我都覺得仍舊是五年前那一羣呢！</p>
<p>然而，以前我自己親身所體騐過的事情却是幻變得太劇烈啦。</p>
<p>第二班的火車到了。我鑽進車廂裏緊合着眼睛，我不想再看什麼了，我怕從細細的沙粒中找出我們的過去的足跡來。</p>
<p>嘟！車在轉動了。我垂下頭，想把往事都丟到車後去。無意中我竟唸着一句古詩：「昔我去兮，雨雪霏霏，今我來兮，楊柳依依。」</p>
<p>車輪擦着鐵軌，軋得軋得，火車頭嗚嗚地呌着，我側耳諦聽，曹娥江在晨色中漸漸地逝去啦！</p>

<p>（四）中山狼</p>
<p>康海的東郭先生誤救中山狼雜劇，係爲議刺李夢陽，以洩自己的憤懣之作，大概是並不附會的事實。同時馬中錫，這也曾吃了劉瑾的虧的人，更作了一篇中山狼傳，拿散文抒寫着同一的故事。鈕琇在他的觚　裏，對馬作說提出了異議，見言觚「玉劍讹」條：</p>
<p>「中山狼傳，爲宋謝良所著，雖遊戲之筆，當時必有所指，而不欲明言，托此以抒憤耳。玉劍尊聞曰：「李獻吉下獄時，劉瑾欲殺之急乃書片紙出，謂：「對山捄我！」家人往告康，康即上馬，馳至瑾門白之，明日赦出。其後獻吉反嫉害對山，馬中錫撰中山狼傳以刺獻吉。」夫對山之捄獻吉，原非望報於獻吉也。獻吉即有忮忌，何至若「中山狼」之甚乎？況其文體豐茂，非宋人不辦。馬東田有憾於獻吉，書此相誚，遂以爲撰自東田，明文英華仍之，蓋亦未深考矣。」</p>
<p>董輯曲海總目提要卷五，著錄中山狼條，考內到中山狼傳全文，亦云宋謝良著，末註云：「按紀錄彙編云是馬中錫作。提要許是受鈕氏觚賸所云之啓示。亦未可知？鈕氏的「書以相誚」說，不無是可能的解釋，但謝良其人似不審其出處，二書亦均未曾提到。要之，以中山狼傳屬之宋人手筆，確實與否，姑置不論，這「負恩」故事的流傳，早已應有更久遠的歷史了。</p>
<p>提要在目次中，標中山狼雜劇的著書，爲馬中錫！本條考云：</p>
<p>「時人以議李夢陽也。（中略）時人作中山狼雜劇以刺之，或云即海所作也。」</p>
<p>提要的作者縱沒有肯定地將作者歸之對山，僅疊云「時人」，實絲毫並未牽涉到馬。此蓋提要引中山狼傳，註「是馬中錫作云云，輯校者看錯，以爲係指雜劇而言，遂致此讹異，未加檢點出來。（完）</p>

<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>猶豫了幾天，張文燦終於來了，後面跟着穿月白竹布背心的張寡婦。母子倆神情都顯得很灰黯，像發生了什麼意外。</p>
<p>讓她謙遜着坐下了，開口第一句就是：</p>
<p>「先生，我們阿燦是來向你辭行的，他明天就要出門，到城裏學生意去了。」</p>
<p>「哦！」巨卿先生像憑空聽見了霹靂，衹答應了一個字。</p>
<p>「是的，到城裏一家布店裏學生意，是他舅舅辦的。」輕輕嘆了口氣，接續着說：「孩子年紀這樣輕，人地生疏的出遠門，我家裏又是孤零零的一個，說起來也真不放心。本來照我的主意，再過那麼三四年，跟你先生多討教點，到個十七八歲出門，那多好！可是他舅舅說：現在找生意爲難，有機會還是讓他早點出門妥當。……唉，衹怪阿燦這孩子命苦，他爹死得早！」</p>
<p>淚珠掛在貧血的臉上，凄切地望了她的兒子。</p>
<p>文燦紅着眼睛呆呆地在一邊站着。</p>
<p>「男子漢大丈夫，遲早總有一天要出門，阿燦這孩子在家總算還懂事，想想也就隨他去了。不過在家千日好，出門一日難，學生意吃人家飯，總是苦啊！」</p>
<p>學生把書聲停止了起來，八九雙小眼睛盯着他們，空氣沉靜得可怕。半晌，巨卿先生才安慰着張寡婦說：</p>
<p>「你放心好了，文燦這孩子很懂事，將來一定是出山，你放心！」</p>
<p>「是嗎？謝謝你先生的金言了！——阿燦，你總要「熬勝」，有志氣，不要忘記先生的話！」又回頭鄭重地對着先生：「將來我們有信札來往，還要拜託先生勞駕。」</p>
<p>文燦點了點頭，沒話說，包滿在眼眶上的淚水，再也忍不住，簌簌地流了下來。</p>
<p>巨卿先生送走了這一對母子以後，自己也幾乎流下眼淚來了。</p>
<p>自然，情形這樣悽慘的不衹是巨卿先生的蒙館，其餘的私塾全都一樣，而且多數還不如他。說也奇怪，近來這鎮上的神聖的教育事業，非但一點也沒有桃李門牆，化被三千的氣慨；却像了乾油的殘燈，陰慘慘，半明不滅，衹仗着一根燈芯的微光，持撐着這殘破的大局。</p>
<p>同時鎮上一般私塾的共同敵人—學校，情形也正有點風凄雨切的樣子。</p>
<p>正月底，區立小學校開學還不到半個月，鎮上紛紛地轟傳着他們醖釀風潮的消息。</p>
<p>區立小學校是個有名的窮學堂，校長常常由校董掛名兼職，三個教員，用的常是在本鄉浮來蕩去的失學青年，或是從外鄉飄回來五光十色的人物，問起來，也許跟校董先生有點沾親帶眷；偶然有一個外鄉教員，往往是衣冠落拓名士派頭十足的先生。薪水呢，校長每月十二塊大洋，教員從五塊到八塊。每年寒假暑假，散了學，先生們往往還有兩三個月的薪水沒領到，坐着乾等。當教員的人不到山窮水盡，大概不會進這個學校。</p>
<p>然而熱心教育的人是有的，想當區立小學校的校董的倒並不少。</p>

<p>檢讀三號報紙，於所謂黃色消息內，關於自殺事件竟可彙集如下四項：（一）與化婦人張于氏，其夫失業已一載餘，一家生計，帶賴氏在美豐織綢廠工作度日，然所人甚微，時有斷炊之虞，因思來日方長，何以維持？怨忿之餘，遽萌壓世，背人潛吞鴉片自盡。（二）常州人應三囝，業鐵車生意，忽假麥根路永安旅館，服毒辣自殺，遺書岳母，言因負債櫐櫐，無法償還，不得已而出此。（三七界傳說少）年岳如豐，因經濟困難，竟謀死念，雙身至北泥城橋東南旅館，潛服重量來沙爾毒藥自殺。（四）海關稅務學校學生廣東人林蘇，因秉性遲鈍，故每屆考試，未能及格，居常悒悒：近又屆小考，致用腦過渡，神經錯亂，恐日後不能畢業一職司，日來成受刺激更深，遽爾厭世。取菜刀一柄，抹喉自盡。</p>
<p>自殺，這在一兩年前還是使人注意的事情；但是現在雖然在這些字句中呈露斑斑的血痕，一般社會的觀或是已經麻庳了，自殺幾個，算得甚麼一回事。可是近來，自殺這一風氣，已經由中上社會層轉入一般民衆，由情塲失意受人侮弄的個別事件，變爲以經濟困難爲基因的廣大的發生，如果我們以自殺發生的繁多來觀察，以其顯露更嚴重之社會意義來考査，那就不能不說，確實並非校事。</p>
<p>正如整個局勢的走入險境，中國國民經濟已經到了「被迫上吊」的地步，由農村破產而產業衰頹，在此情况下，隨着鄉裏農民殺子自殺合門同殉之後，這東方巴黎的上海，也進入這一絕路。商店關門，工廠停工，幾乎已是「見慣不驚」，這許多失職失業的人怎麼辦呢？許多生存機會被剝奪而沒有看清這一根源的人，就這樣無明的厭世犧牲了！</p>
<p>因之，自殺事態的嚴重，何曾在於個人的「大解脫」呢？牠象徵着國民經濟的自殺，民族國祚的自殺；引用旁的一種經濟提携來挽救，想從此獲得一點「雨露之恩」，這種飲鴆化渴的辦法，能得不謂自殺？</p>
<h3 id="c258">春野的星火 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 克明</p>
<p>（「野火燃不盡，春風吹又生。」一到三月，在田野間的一堆堆的紙灰的星火中，蘊育着的全是對死去了的一代之可嘆的追懷與慕戀。且包括有：年靑人的抑鬱，小孀女的死去了的戀情，這一切，全隨着紙蝴蝶飄向高空去了。</p>
<p>死去的終於死去了，且是永遠地：而命定着的未死的人，也終將無可奈何地爬到土穴裏去；生生息息的姿態是那樣地被形成的，生命之流的彙集處就是枯寂的黃土呢。</p>
<p>而眞的能够和大自然的鐵律去奮鬥的，於是，便只能說唯有寒食時分的墓前的野火了，它，隨着春風的氣息，不絕地倔强地閃霎着，掙扎着，像要對土穴中的諸死靈驕傲地誇着大口似的——明滅着，又明滅着。</p>
<p>春野的星火是可怕的啊！）</p>
<p>跟趕車的到譚家巷的時候，在野田裏已經看得見一抹春天的色調了，生活　我從愛着的土地間好遠地浪出去，而　一次重又看到北地的小村子的春天，在記憶中的野田中，卻綴上了不少的新墳與土墩了。</p>
<p>「這許多的墳哪！」對的，我明白，馳想中的故鄉人全在亂世的厄運下不聲不響（？）的爬下黃士了；但是，我記念着的是，那些刻劃在黃黑的老臉上的老實的，可信任的綫條哪。</p>
<p>趕車的可咶了一下嘴，懷着不平的與嘵舌者的臉色，提起繩鞭子狠地往牲口的背脊上抽了一下，回頭來對我瞧看、嘻的做出了一種聲音，像嘆息，可又像苦笑——</p>
<p>「先生，你家有福氣人，可不大詳細啦，這年份鄉下人可全沒有好運氣，死的死了，溜的溜了：剩下的呢，沒力氣，跑不上遠路，也丟不開老家門前的一條小河，一片太陽，便橫了心，挺了死那末一天不知道一天地活下去了。」</p>
<p>春天的田野間是不適宜於叙述不快意的事跡的啊，而且，就是那一堆新墩和野地的紙錢灰對我叙述還不够嗎？那麼着，我想沈默。</p>
<p>但是老車夫的過往的苦難簡直沒法鉗住他的舌頭——這，可眞是不容易的，喘了口氣，便又拙笨地把一串難受的聲音吐出來了——</p>
<p>「幾年來鄕裏是變得不認識了——大兵打過杖，跟着便是一述串的荒年，時世是一天不如一矢了，鄕裏可不好過呢——鎭上有人販米糧，販油醬，販雜貨的可也過不下去了，全多「放了馬」，——秋裏大水冲來的季節，老鄉親可死得多啦，死得多啦……</p>
<p>「男客全溜了出去，堂客給丟在家鄉挨餓——這是什麼話啊，那個樣咾，俏一點兒的，便跟外路來的販子搭呀搭的便搭走了，這世路，還說什麼的！人家醫如男客死了，走上田頭燒把野火。就那麼的：死的死了。去的也永不回來了。」</p>
<p>聽着，說着，人是沒精打采的，　子拖着木輪車，輾在泥路上像鼠子在啃嘴着一些什麼東西，怪呌人不舒服的。這一回故土的影子是眞的在眼前呈現了，但是多黑的一個影子啊！</p>
<p>春野裏的星火是不絕的，遠處也有胃起黑烟來的紙灰堆。春掠過，却無休止地閃起人一點點的星火，像代表了一羣人的苦難，也像象徵了另一種橫過北地的荒土的無窮盡的抑鬱似的。</p>
<p>今年的寒食是不適宜於遊春的了，田野裏的星火是蘊育着另一種不愉快的意味的：「死的死了，而去的也永不會回來了。」</p>
<h3 id="c259">鳳凰之娘 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>從韓山麓沿噁溪邊開行，要苦爬了整天的高山峻嶺，闖過無數的渺無人烟的荒谷深林，才能日暮鳥歸林的時分，拖着酸重的步調，幽然從埔尾嶺沒入鳳凰村內去！</p>
<p>萬山叢疊中，到了中間，便可由有深林幽寂，水聲淙淙的大自然的低奏裏，像探首前望般，忽然閃見了一個淸秀朗明的閒逸出鹿的人間，使人頓然醉迷了！這兒，便是鳳凰山鳳凰村了，在十多年前，差不多是完全和外界膈絕的。</p>
<p>這像桃源洞的深山內的女人很特別，後來頭屆的縣城人們，呌她們「鳳凰之娘，」是含着很稀奇的意味。大約是山秀水淸吧，景色太潔凈了吧？女人們雖然頂勞苦，整年整日給風吹日曬雨打，皮膚却是仍舊細白淸凈，純樸天眞。她們自祖宗幾百年遺傳下來，從來就自成習俗，未有纏足這回事。未成年的少女，是背着一支長辮子。成年的婦人，每天鷄鳴五點卽起，一定要化一個鐘頭的工夫，頭髮搽了許多茶油，梳裝得像一部機器那樣的複雜龐大，插了多件的裝飾品，後面梳成突出的一柄大斧頭似的，那形狀是怪奇異的。而且，只要踏出閨門、在家庭內，在農田中，頭上必要蓋上一塊四方的厚厚的黑藍色布，布的邊綠縫上紅絲線，兩雙耳朵，又非刺</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>個小洞，掛上耳鉤不可。無論在任何時候，衫袖要齊到手掌，長一定須遮過雙膝，這既不像旗袍，又不是矮衫，不管那是炎夏春天，總是四季如常的，同樣老穿著黑布衣服，再不會有第二種服裝的。而從來就沒有見過她們穿襪子，除了做新娘那天外。穿鞋子的，那也是很稀奇的。老喜歡拖雙木屐兒，就是連木屐兒也便一踏進家門便脫掉了。一般的都是老遠的赤足；做媳婦的每個足底，幾乎沒有一個是不龜裂的。即使出門做客去，拖著拖鞋的，那已經是稀奇有了，穿鞋子簡直沒有。有些有錢人的老太太，兒子勉強她穿襪子，她會覺得那是十分麻煩而討厭的。</p>
<p>差不多是家家種田的，不管貴賤，有錢人的女人，也要赤足下田，這真是奇異的風俗呢！她們的體力很強，不只家庭內一切的事情都是女人做的，就是田種的工作，女人也要工作得比男人多些；而且上深山去斬柴採薪，全是女人的責任，如果男子跟女人一道去上山的，那會給人家笑話，還有許多女人要越山爬嶺去當苦力，那種克苦的精神，真是任何處的女人所不及的。所以女人的生產力，常常是會比其夫更強的。不是，她們勞苦過人，所受的待遇卻是更奇慘！其夫像一個公子少爺！但他們的家長還一定要他們的妻子終年勞苦工作。其夫像個貴主人，妻子全如賤僕人，我幼年便想不透他們這種夫妻生活是怎樣過的。是以什麼理由使女人這樣。</p>

<h3 id="c260">送贈三百手頭字表 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>附白張戴三君意見</p>
<p>自從本欄發表了幾封關於手頭字的信以後，編者便接到許多讀者的來信，有的是對於已選定的手頭字，加以商榷；有的是討論推行手頭字的方法，而大多數的還是把自己所知道的手頭字告訴我們。他們對於手頭字的熱心，是可佩的，不過有些讀者因為沒有看到那已經選定的三百手頭字的全部，所以他們雖然寫了幾十個手頭字來，而實際上，沒有採入那三百個的手頭字，卻極少；有些讀者所寫來的許多手頭字，竟都是那三百字中已經有的，這種情形不是白白耗費許多讀者的精神和時間嗎？同時我又接到很多讀者來信，要求我們把那三百個手頭字的全部，隔幾天在本欄登載一次，以供他們的參考和採用。這種要求，因為本欄的篇幅所限，實在不能辦到。所以編者為了補救以上兩件事，向請手頭字推行會把那三百字印成一張表，假使讀者需要參考的話，請附郵資一分寄來，編者當寄奉一份。關於討論手頭字的信，茲先擇要發表一部份如下：</p>
<p>白虹君的意見：刻讀餘放君所舉幾個簡筆字，其中「壘」字，係另有此字，讀作磊，為砲壘高壘，不能作壘字之簡單字。（壘）之簡筆字，應作「垒」。</p>
<p>又手頭字推行會所選三百字彙中，「穀」作「谷」，「够」作「勾」，均不妥。因「谷」「勾」另有獨立的字意。其實「穀」字簡寫，普通均作「槖」。「漢」字作「汉」，「嘆」字作「叹」均不習見，如改「叹」為「咲」似，較通俗也。又「發」字作「蕟」，不如作「発」。「縣」字作「县」，不如作「　」因「┗」這種繪畫，只有印刷體尚有，偕書中並不存在矣。茲再遵編者意，列舉自己所知之手頭字如下：春作「　」，　作「察」歷作「厤」。</p>
<p>張困齋君建議：我是非常同意於手頭字的推行。現在我也一點意見提出來，希望大家來討論。</p>
<p>我們普通寫「編」字，大概都寫成「編」字，其餘凡是「糹」字旁的，也總是這樣寫的，寫出來大家也是認識的。別的「言」字旁，也可以省寫幾筆。譬如「詩」寫作「诗」，「誠」作「誠」。水旁的「鴻」字，改作「鴻」字也比較便利些不知提倡手頭字的諸位先生以為如何？</p>

<p>開篇「弔戰場」</p>
<p>只緣名利奪軍州。殺伐循環不肯休。多少英雄豪傑士。雄心多想做王侯。但只見江水滔滔東逝去。古來名將幾人留。只落得馬革裹尸歸故墓。一抔黃土像饅頭。爭戰之時天地黯。河山變色也為愁。笳鼓　　敲欲絕。健兒個個動戈矛。一陣分開成勝敗。幾多碧血滿山楸。閨中入夢三更後。戌鼓悽涼擊未休。白骨如山枯已久。斜陽長伴歲悠悠。只　她墳中一點英雄血。保障民生功最優。我今獨自來憑弔。天地關山草木愁。千百年來相戰伐。大家敵愾與同仇。方不愧英　名姓留。</p>

<h3 id="c265">獲得一九三四年度電影藝術學院褒獎的六大明星（下） <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>（二）事後的評定</p>
<p>榮譽的褒獎，終於在二月二十七日夜晚而揭曉了：結果，克拉克蓋博以「一夜風流」，瑙瑪希拉以「閨怨」，威廉鮑惠爾以「大偵探聶克」，葛萊絲摩亞以「歌后情痴」，法蘭毛根以「雲臺春鎖」克勞黛考爾白以「一夜風流」而獲得總兵六人，男女摻半。</p>
<p>然而揭曉之後，問題又發生了，上面所說的六人之中，男女明星，究竟那兩個的藝術，已達最高峯而列在第一名呢！</p>
<p>可是這不免要使你失望了，電影藝術科學研究不但不把名次的先後列出，連得六個人之中，每個人評選的結果，獲得幾票，也不會來告訴你，而他們發表名單，便以各人英文名字裏面第一個字母為排列的次序。</p>
<p>因此，我們發現到名單中女星的先后，克勞黛考爾白第一，葛萊摩絲亞第二，瑙瑪希拉第三。</p>
<p>至於男星，那麼克拉克蓋博第一，法蘭毛根第二，威廉鮑惠爾第三。</p>
<p>所以在上面的名單之中，究竟誰是第一，我們無法指認，甚至二月二十七日之夜，研究院究竟用何種方式選定，局外人也不得而知。同樣，在過去一年那一張影片可充去年的代表作。</p>
<p>這一次名單揭曉而後，使得好萊塢的人們認為驚異的，便是兩個演員，為了主演同一的影片而獲得褒獎——克拉克蓋博和克勞黛考爾白都為「一夜風流」而獲獎，自研究院辦理此項褒獎以來，兩個演員以一張影片而獲獎，從來不會有過，還是第一次呢！</p>
<p>電影城裏，一般的人，早就在說瑙瑪希拉在「閨怨」中飾白郎寗夫人的演出，足使她獲得一九三四年度電影藝術科學研究院褒獎的，結果，真的猜中了。威廉鮑惠爾至少初選可以錄入，蓋博和考爾白的合作，也是任何人認為有得獎的可能。</p>
<p>同時在反對方面，有人在為了法蘭毛根的獲獎而不平，他們都說毛根的獲得褒獎，是把康斯登裴涅脫和茀特立馬區的地位偷得來的：不過也有人以為毛根是應得選入的，也許連得毛根自己在名單上面看見他的名字，也要驚奇呢！</p>
<p>哥侖比亞對於「歌後情痴」一片，本來並不重視，直到經過評選而後，才發現其中有很多原由，可以獲得褒獎。在這影片中，葛萊絲摩亞的歌唱和表情，已到達了最高峯，因此，在三個獲獎的女星之中，能夠佔居一席。這影片已列入好萊塢一九三四年度最上選的十二鉅片之中，導演維克多斯卻捷克Victor　Schertzinger，也因此片而獲得褒獎，藝術界人都承認在「歌後情痴」中幾支曲譜，已是堪稱藝術的最高峯了。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c266">評「恨海孤魂」 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 鏟非</p>
<p>A　Wicked　Woman</p>
<p>—南京映</p>
<p>在原名上雖然題著「不良的婦人」，實際上卻是定了一個賢母良妻，因為這影片中女主人翁的殺害丈夫是為著子女，她不畏艱苦的掙扎也是為了子女。換言之，為了子女的所謂幸福，到後來她終於使子女從饑寒緊迫的境況中扶養成人，爭得從盜匪到良民的地位。而且她是一個良心極好的女人，她有著善良的本性，因此她始終不會忘記危害丈夫是上帝不可饒恕的罪惡，也是國家法律所不可饒恕的兇犯，所以她以為子女的過失，都是天譴，她到底實行了。但因為觀眾同情她的原故，所以在最後將天理，國法，人情併在一道，應當判決死罪的她竟改為無罪開釋了。既踐了神的誓言，復蒙國法的赦宥，（似乎有一點和法律開玩笑，）再加上再醮給如意郎君，這不良婦人給與舊觀念的人們極佳的印象了。</p>
<p>在封建時代，這主人公瑙蜜未嘗不是一個革命的女子。槍殺丈夫，艱苦掙扎，自食其力，犧牲自己為後代謀幸福。然而這是膚淺的觀察，假使更精彩的探討作品的內在，將必然的發現劇作者對舊社會制度極力維護的用心。瑙蜜的殺害丈夫，正是劇作者更深刻一點來維護舊道德的存在。她因著丈夫不能安貧，因著丈夫要鋌而走險，更因著丈夫不能道德良心的做一個正人君子，於是她殺害丈夫正是為社會除害，使自己的子女能夠成為道德中人。瑙蜜在這裹腳是衛道者理想中的完人，她是良母，到後來嫁給報館主筆，將必然的也是良妻。然而她到底是理想中的人物啊！我們在其中很難看到真實性的。</p>
<p>現在我們再來看作者們（包括導演，演員，編劇……等）是怎樣的創造他們的人物，怎樣的以舊觀念形態來感動觀眾的？</p>
<p>在狂風暴雨之夜，在那水邊的小屋子裏，窮人之妻的殺死了丈夫，正在這危急的時候，他的兒子醒了，她不能不忍著怔忡的心安慰小孩睡覺，十分慈愛的唱著催眠歌。不久，她劃著小船，在狂風暴雨之中將丈夫的屍身擲入河底。……這一場戲，無論是音響效果，無論是新演員美德克利絲細（Mady　Christians）的演技，無論是攝影，無論是導演卻利斯勃拉賓（Cbarles　Brabin）對於情緒之緊湊的把握以及急速的變換，無論劇作者使她表現了殺夫的狠毒立刻又表現她對子女的慈愛，都綜合的成為精采的技術表現。</p>
<p>以後我們聽到女主人公在對上帝懺悔，因為她為了女子要在罪惡中生活下去，等待子女成人之後，她誓去自首贖罪的。若干時以後，她在工廠裏做工回來，大女兒在燒飯，二女兒在偷著要洋囡囡，兒子一面給弟弟洗澡，一面卻在遊嬉，她立刻督促女兒工作，督促兒子讀書，更由於小兒子的洗澡描畫家庭的和平。在觀眾一陣歡笑之後，她狠心的燒了二女兒的洋囡囡，（二女兒的個性作為以後離家情奔的伏線）緊接著便是她內心痛苦的哭泣，這給與人們極大的感動。</p>
<p>到了十二年之後，兒女長成，各有職業，這裏由於母親舊著汽車，說明子女們的職業，個性，并且開始說明她和兒子的報館主筆之間的愛情。在那晚飯後的休息時間，小兒子拉提琴，二女兒彈披霞娜……充滿了家庭的快樂。子女們各自安寢後，她和主筆很投機的談話，同時描寫她內心的悲苦，二女兒夜會情人，更在小兒子的足球上，刻畫殘廢者的悲哀。……在這些地方，都是非常電影藝術的描寫。至於自首時離家之前，在火車上，在法庭中母親子女的抱頭痛哭，無一不表現著技術上的成功。</p>
<p>無論在那一方面，都說明作者們在技術上的熟練。為了衛道的作用，將他們理想中的完人，活生生的表現出來，正是說明電影作品感人力量之宏大。新的倫理片，固然可以真實的作為服務於新時代的東西，而舊的倫理觀念，也充分的成為舊社會說教的工具。因此，這「恨海孤魂」仍不失為一部不平凡的作品。</p>
<h3 id="c267">關於「紅粉鐵血」 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 青</p>
<p>戰事鉅片「紅粉鐵血」，I　Was　A　Spy`為英國高象公司一部光榮的出品，主角係康拉維德及曼琳卡洛等，他們的聲譽，早已傳遍世界。全片情節以歐戰史賓為藍本，寫一比利時女子，逼於德軍淫威，在德軍後方醫院，看護傷兵。衹聞慘呼呻吟，呼母索兒，悲不忍覩，慘不忍聞。復因國家顛覆，論為亡國女兒。遂不惜一己生命，暗充間諜，為國家樹力奇功，其志其行，殊堪欽佩。本片除情節緊湊及表演深刻外，更有飛機轟炸種種驚人場面，茲聞已定於星期五起，在霞飛路巴黎大戲院開映云。</p>
<h3 id="c268">「逃亡」現已重映 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 青雲</p>
<p>藝華公司本年度偉大出品，中外各報一致讚美的音樂歌唱片「逃亡」，自上月二十一日起在金城大戲院公映以來，每日每場無不告客滿。嗣因本埠各戲院及各製片公司，已定三十一日假廛金城開會歡迎出席蘇俄國際電影展覽會我們代表陶伯遜君，而金城亦決定是日起重映「漁光曲」數天，「逃亡」因此遂暫告停映。現「逃亡」因受多數觀眾之來函要求，決定提前於今日（四日）起重映於金城大戲院云。（卻）</p>
<h3 id="c269">「金時計」即將開拍 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>蔡楚生繼「新女性」後之新作，因各方對其於去年編就之「人類動物園」劇本頗加讚美，故聯華當局亦擬由蔡氏導攝是劇。惟蔡氏因「人類動物園」演員眾多，有數主角尚須物色，而背景復多為嚴冬，此時從事攝制，殊不適宜，況兩廠集中後，即須有新片開拍，故蔡氏決定暫將此劇本擱置。並於旬日埋頭之下，完成其「金時計」（暫名）劇本。關於此劇骨幹，係取材於俄國名著。但為增強劇力及適合國情計，更益以精雋之補充，而成為非常動人之影劇。預料此片一出，其造福於兒童者當非淺鮮。聞主角已選定聯華新發現之神童葛佐治，及在「新女性」中有良好成績之陳素娟等云。</p>

<p>— 培元</p>
<p>曼娜小孩子病了，病的是最易傳染的百日咳。素秋仍然每天帶了自己的孩子同去。但由於這樣，素秋的孩子不幸傳染著了曼娜的孩子的百日咳。所以曼娜的孩子病好，素秋的孩子卻病了。素秋同夢鷗帶著孩子到濟仁醫院施診室候診時候，巧遇著多年不見的喬傑，喬傑也是來醫治他受了彈傷的右腕，原來喬傑離開夢鷗家裏適逢一二八戰事爆發，他便加入前線作戰，傷了右腕，戰事結束後，他被遣散而在街頭漂泊著。同時他們又遇到了曼娜和柳營，因為這天曼娜的孩子在濟仁醫院病愈出院了。他們正預備上汽車時，適夢鷗素秋抱著小孩出院，柳榮見了夢鷗即上前招呼，使他又羞又愧又憤，但曼娜卻裝著不認識夢鷗的樣子。柳榮雖願意用他的汽車送夢鷗等回去，但夢鷗是謝卻了。</p>
<p>在路上夢鷗責素秋為什麼隱瞞他，素秋很悲切的回答：「我恨你不准我去，所以我只好秘密起來。」夢鷗點頭傲然的說：「真是倒霉透頂，今天竟碰著這對壞蛋」。夢鷗素秋孩子的病加沉重了，可是沒有錢請醫生治，只在眼睜睜的望著愛兒在床上呻吟著。</p>
<p>夢鷗在沒有救濟的辦法中，想去找喬傑設法去。但夢鷗找到了喬傑住的地方之時，正喬傑因欠租費未付被房東攢出的時候。這時，正是狂風暴雨互相逞威的時候，兩人的身上都被雨淋得像落湯雞一般。「這領會待我們未免太殘酷了吧？」夢鷗吐出了這一句慘痛的呼聲。喬傑卻安慰的說：「夢鷗，不要灰心，前途還在，我們應該努力的幹去」。「那麼請你還是住到我們那裏去吧」！但喬卻推辭的說：「謝謝，我現在已經漂泊慣了，有了定所反顯得煩人，再會吧」！說著攜著一包衣服在大風雨中向前去了。</p>
<p>夢鷗呆視著喬傑漸漸渺小的背項時，有兩個人趨近夢鷗面前問：「林先生，久違了，我們正在四處找你，湊巧會碰見，真巧極啦……敝報館正缺少一位編輯，想請先生擔任……」夢鷗一樣的隨著他們去了。</p>
<p>風和雨不停止的在施展它的威力，另一方面的對素秋是流著淚著他口中不住喊著「汽車聲音響了，爸爸帶汽車回來了吧」的微弱聲音的病兒。</p>
<p>夢鷗隨著那兩人到了報館，見了主編，答應給夢鷗每月一百五十元的編輯費，但先決的條件是要夢鷗先作一篇關於賣國的論文，因為這報館是有背景的。可是夢鷗雖窮，雖失業，但它去不肯為了個人的利益，而甘心做那賣國的漢奸。他堅決的沒有答應。</p>
<p>夢鷗的小孩在渴念著爸爸帶像小榮那樣的汽車中而病死了，素秋的手摸著他愛兒的鼻孔已停止呼吸時，她像失去了什麼似的而驚嚇得張著嘴，永久的張嘴，她沒哭，沒有大聲的哭，也沒有小聲的哭，但她眼眶裏緊隨著流出來的淚水卻是殷紅的血！</p>
<p>夢鷗從報館裏出來，在風雨交加過身衣服盡濕的歸途上，拖著學生的腳步，聲音「的踏，的踏」的響，臉上失去了活人的笑容，死人樣的可怕！</p>
<p>「畢業就是失業，文憑賣幾文一斤」？這是「人生之哀歌」的中心問題。（完）</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Tian Songyao, the Second Route Commander of the bandit suppression forces in Sichuan, formerly held the position of Bandit Suppression Commissioner for the Sichuan Border Region. He repeatedly lost cities such as Ba, Yi, Zhao, Guang, Wen, and Cang, allowing bandits like Xu and Zhang to grow stronger daily. This time, just as Sichuan's administration was about to be unified and Chairman Chiang flew to Sichuan and Guizhou to supervise the bandit suppression, he retreated without authorization, allowing bandits to cross the river. Chairman Chiang ordered his troops to be reorganized and absorbed by Sun Zhen, and the commanding officers who abandoned the river will be investigated and punished accordingly. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Fourth Group Army received a telegram from Guizhou on the 3rd stating: (1) The bandits have already crossed the river and fled to the area west of Xifeng and Zhazuo; (2) The main force of the bandits is near Shashi and Andi, with a portion crossing the Wu River and fleeing to Xifeng. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Central and Guizhou provincial troops in Guiyang are currently engaged in fierce fighting with communist bandits in the northern border of Guizhou. Chairman Chiang has already ordered the Guangxi and Yunnan armies to advance to the front lines. The communist bandits, numbering approximately 10,000, are currently concentrated in Xifeng, which is located on the upper reaches of the Wu River, 50 miles north of Guiyang. The communist bandits crossed the Wu River using bamboo rafts. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Changsha) Xiao He's bandit gang entrenched themselves in the Yongshun border area, stubbornly resisting the perilous terrain around Songbai Chang. At dawn on the 30th, the Zhong and Wang brigades of our 62nd Division, along with the He and Du units of the 16th Division, launched a major encirclement from Ba Xi and Bogutang towards the bandits. From morning to noon, a fierce battle raged throughout the day, ultimately defeating the bandits. The bandits suffered over a thousand casualties and a complete collapse, with the remnants fleeing towards Feixia Mountain and Yuping Mountain. Furthermore, after our Chen Quzhen Division defeated the bandit gang at Longtouzhai, they immediately advanced at full speed. On the 28th at noon, they encountered the bandits at Xichebao, Tangfangping, and other locations, immediately engaging in fierce fighting until dusk. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and gradually could not withstand the pressure, retreating from Zhipengshi towards Longshan. In this battle, a total of more than 530 bandits were killed, countless were wounded, more than 60 bandit shelters were burned, and a large amount of supplies were seized. In addition, scattered bandits in Meijiaqiao, Kuzhuangdu, and other places in Sangzhi have been continuously searched and suppressed by units under Commander Chen Yaohan, resulting in the death of more than 400 bandits, with many wounded and captured. The remnants of the Red Bandit Pseudo-Model Division, entrenched in the high mountains around Yanwukou on the Sangyong border, were also defeated by our Chen's forces, with 200 to 300 bandits killed. The remnants are fleeing towards the Longyong border and are being pursued. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Considering the frequent disasters in Hubei, Chairman Chiang previously instructed the provincial government to earnestly formulate a disaster relief and famine preparedness plan within its capabilities. On the 3rd, he again telegraphed the provincial government, providing instructions on fundamental and short-term measures for preventing and relieving disasters and famines. He emphasized the timely promotion and appropriate encouragement of grain regulation, financial relief, the establishment of public farms, the popularization of cooperative enterprises, and other disaster prevention measures. He also stated that historical disaster prevention methods that could serve as references and lessons should be studied in detail and adopted as appropriate. With government guidance from above and people's efforts from below, significant results would be achieved, avoiding the predicament of "digging a well only when thirsty."

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 3rd stating that the late martyr Fan Hongxian was of pure character, loyal, and outstanding talent. During the Xinhai Revolution, he gathered righteous troops and valiantly captured Jinling, achieving great merit. During the campaign against Yuan Shikai, he fought battles between Anhui and Shanghai, repeatedly facing danger, yet persevering undaunted. Unfortunately, his great ambition remained unfulfilled, and he was assassinated. Remembering his legacy of loyalty and mourning his loss deeply, it is necessary to specially commend him to elucidate his latent virtue. Fan Hongxian is posthumously awarded the rank of Army General to demonstrate the nation's highest respect and reward for loyalty and martyrdom. This order is hereby issued.

<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news reports that the Soviet Union and Japan are about to conclude a non-aggression treaty. Today, reporters inquired about the truth of this matter with those familiar with diplomatic affairs. According to sources, the Soviet Union made this proposal long ago, but the Japanese side believes that before concluding the treaty, the provision in the Treaty of Portsmouth prohibiting the construction of defensive works must be resolved first. Therefore, there seem to be no new developments recently. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Each supervisory envoy will establish an office. The organization of the office has been reviewed and revised by Gao Yihan and others dispatched by Yu Youren, but it is not yet completed. The expenses for each district have been approved by the central government, with a monthly expenditure of approximately 3,500 yuan, included in the national general budget for the 23rd year. It is said that it is planned to first convene the envoys in Nanjing to discuss the organizational and operational methods for each district. After all preparations are completed and they have been sworn into office in Nanjing, the envoys will proceed to their respective districts for inspection tours. The offices in each district can be established in early May. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources at the Control Yuan, the organizational regulations for the supervisory envoy's office are being jointly drafted by Control Committee members Gao Yihan and Zhou Lisheng, along with several counselors, as assigned by the President of the Yuan. Once drafted, they will be submitted to the central government for approval. The supervisory envoy's office will have a certain number of secretaries and clerks, but will not be divided into departments for the time being, and the scope will not be expanded. The budget for the 23rd year was originally listed as more than 6,000 yuan per office, but the actual amount is quite insufficient. It is planned to slightly increase the budget for the 24th year, but it will likely remain below 10,000 yuan. The establishment date is currently undecided, but it will be no later than June. After Liu Shouzhong, the Supervisory Envoy of the Chahar District, who had already been announced, resigned, a replacement has not yet been appointed. It is also reported that the newly appointed Supervisory Envoy of Anhui and Jiangxi, Miao Peicheng, was originally a member of the Central Committee and is currently serving as a Party Affairs Commissioner in Anqing. Chen Zhaoying, the Supervisory Envoy of Fujian and Zhejiang, was originally a member of the Central Committee and is currently serving as a Party Affairs Commissioner in Fuzhou. Gao Yihan, the Supervisory Envoy of Hunan and Hubei, and Zhou Lisheng, the Supervisory Envoy of Hebei, were originally members of the Control Committee and are currently in Nanjing. Fang Juehui, the Supervisory Envoy of Henan and Shandong, was originally a member of the Central Committee and is currently serving as a Party Affairs Commissioner in Kaifeng. Dai Kuisheng was originally a member of the Central Committee and is currently in Beijing. Ding Chaowu was originally a member of the Central Committee and also served as the Party Affairs Commissioner of Jiangxi, and is currently also in Beijing. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

It was decided that the departure would begin on the 10th. If there are insufficient vehicles, the movement will be postponed to the 12th. The departure will be completed within half a month. The old peace preservation corps will be transferred out within one week of the new corps' arrival. Zhao Lei, the commander of the Second Peace Preservation Corps of the War Zone, arrived in Tianjin by train from Tangshan on the night of the 2nd.

<p>(Nanjing) A Central News Agency reporter visited Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi on the 3rd and inquired about the effectiveness of enhancing the three banks of Central, Communications, and China, and the national economic construction of our country. Kong said that our country has been suffering from the world economic panic for years, and the impact of the US raising the price of silver has led to the decline of industry and commerce and the depletion of finance. Therefore, financial public bonds were issued to enrich the capital of the Central, Communications, and China Banks, and Zhang Gongquan was invited to be the vice president of the Central Bank, Song Ziwen was the chairman of the Bank of China, and Song Hanzhang was the general manager, so that the three banks can cooperate practically, concentrate their strength, break through all the financial difficulties, and achieve the goal of self-consolidation. Then, it will be possible to talk about fundamentally improving the financial organization and important issues in finance and economy. As for reducing and exempting export taxes and abolishing transit taxes, it will be realized soon, and there are also specific decisions on how to offset the losses. Chairman Chiang recently initiated the National Economic Construction Movement, which is the foundation for the national self-salvation. Chiang has traveled all over the country due to his bandit suppression work, and deeply felt that the revival of the nation can not be achieved only by military power. Therefore, he launched this movement, hoping that the people of the country will work hard to promote its realization. At the end of the interview, the reporter asked about his opinion on relieving the Yellow River flood. Kong replied that in addition to ordering water conservancy personnel to work hard to block the breaches, attention should also be paid to the problem of changing the course of the Yellow River. According to experts, the Yellow River must change its course every 80 years, and now is a dangerous period, so we must pay attention to the Yellow River and prepare in advance to reduce the disaster.

<p>— Youxiong</p>
<p>Our country has Children's Day. This is already the fifth iteration. Every year on this day, groups and organizations that primarily manage children's education and upbringing either take the opportunity to hold children's health competitions, or specially provide children with entertainment venues. The aim is to give children the opportunity to be happy on this holiday. Looking back on the past events, they were truly grand occasions. This year's Children's Day, because the "Children's Year" is about to be implemented, the central government has ordered large-scale celebrations. Therefore, the scale is even greater than before. In China, which lags behind in everything, being able to pay considerable attention to children is truly something to celebrate for all children and to congratulate the country's future.</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of society and the country. If we want to seek the strength of the country and the prosperity of the nation, we must place importance on the education and upbringing of children. Therefore, all countries have laws to protect children's rights. Ms. Ellen Key even called the 20th century the "Century of the Child," which is enough to show the importance of the children's rights movement. To go a step further, the nation's path is difficult, and today it has almost reached its limit. We adults should certainly work hard, but in the future, part of the heavy burden of reviving the country will inevitably fall on the shoulders of today's children, that is, the future masters. If we do not cultivate their knowledge and morality, and protect their health today, how can they become good citizens when they grow up? Wouldn't it be difficult to ask them to bear the heavy burden of national revival? Therefore, we must not neglect the cultivation of children today. The protection of children's rights, the maintenance of their health, and the universalization of education are the most important aspects of children's development. We should reflect today and ask ourselves whether we have done our best in these areas.</p>
<p>The so-called protection of rights means that children have the right to be nurtured, and this right should be protected by law. However, in today's China, in terms of nurturing, the practice of abandoning and drowning infants and selling children is not yet completely eradicated. Although the Factory Act has been promulgated to prohibit child labor, according to surveys, the number of child laborers nationwide is already over 60,000. These children cannot be supported by their parents and instead sacrifice their undeveloped bodies to support their parents. There is nothing more tragic in the world than this. In terms of education, China's compulsory education system has not yet been implemented. Educational funding is extremely inadequate. On average, only 22% of school-age children nationwide can receive compulsory education. In terms of health, China has always neglected children's hygiene. Various physical defects are gradually increasing. (See the health section of the 23rd and 24th editions of this newspaper's yearbook.) Moreover, the child mortality rate is higher than in any other country. In the past, there have been huge deficiencies in the education and upbringing of children in China. Therefore, what we should strive for in the future is clear.</p>
<p>Now, people in the country have paid considerable attention to children. The government has also issued a clear order stipulating that from August 1st of this year to the end of July next year as "Children's Year." While we are celebrating, we feel that there are several things we should caution. First, it is a common problem in China to talk without acting, or to act without thoroughness. After shouting slogans for this grand Children's Day, if there is no practical action to follow, it will be of no help. Second, given the large number and wide distribution of children in China, there is a risk of bias and omissions in the facilities for children's education and upbringing. For example, urban children may receive temporary preferential treatment, while children scattered in rural areas and among the lower classes are forgotten. This is far from the original intention of benefiting all children in the country. Third, if we want to create healthy children, we must conduct detailed research on all aspects of children's physical and mental well-being. No aspect should be deficient. Therefore, we hope that in addition to practical education and upbringing work, there will also be a movement to study children's issues. (Please refer to the article "Children's Issues in Children's Year" in Volume 4, Number 1 of the Shen Bao Monthly.) occurring in our country.</p>
<p>If people in the country want to learn from and emulate the children's movements in various countries around the world, the American Children's Year movement and the Soviet Union's facilities for children are both worth considering. The American Children's Year movement was led by the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor, and the Women's Division of the National Defense Association was responsible for its promotion. The number of women participating in the activities reached 11 million. In addition to women, countless university professors, church pastors, social workers, and librarians also assisted. It truly brought together the power of the people of the country to seek the improvement of children's happiness, which is something we can emulate. The Soviet Union used all opportunities and facilities across the country to increase children's knowledge and abilities. For example, adult cultural facilities were made available to children at certain times. Theaters and cinemas held special performances for children in the mornings. Workers' clubs could be used by children. Parks and stadiums were open to children. Children had the opportunity and right to participate in or use almost all facilities. This is also something we can refer to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is something we cannot help but say. The education and upbringing of children depends entirely on the knowledge of adults. If the adults in a country are mostly uneducated, it is difficult to achieve good education and upbringing for children. The number of illiterate people in our country is more than half. This is truly a serious problem in our country's education. Therefore, when we talk about children's welfare, we cannot help but think of the need to promote popular education. Society is a whole group. It is like climbing a tree to catch a fish to seek for raising children's education and welfare if society does not improve as a whole.</p>
<p>What this newspaper can do is only to awaken the people of the country to pay attention to children's rights. Therefore, we first established a children's weekly and then compiled and printed "Children's Friend" for this year's Children's Day to help parents and teachers across the country educate and raise their children. We also specially commissioned domestic children's education experts to write articles and list 200,000 copies of the Children's Day commemorative booklet to give to readers of this newspaper. We hope that the children's rights movement can become widespread throughout the country to promote the construction of children's culture. As the saying goes, many hands make light work. If people in the country can work together and make progress together, it will not only be fortunate for all children in the country but also an immeasurable blessing for the Chinese nation.</p>

It should be ordered to all county governments to strictly implement the inspection regulations formulated by the Ministry of Finance. Those who deliberately evade taxes should be investigated and sent to the local judicial organs for punishment according to law. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Eden May Arrive in Czech Capital This Morning; No Development in British-Polish Talks; Met with Pilsudski for a Long Talk Lasting Fifty Minutes; Conditions for Poland to Join the Eastern European Pact Must Be Considered <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Warsaw After Eden met with Polish Foreign Minister Beck and President Mościcki today, he had another meeting with Army Chief Pilsudski for fifty minutes. The meeting took place at the Belvedere Palace. Both spoke in French. Pilsudski clarified Poland's position, especially regarding the Eastern European Military Mutual Assistance Pact. There were no new decisions made in today's talks. However, it is believed that various suggestions were considered, and it is expected that French Foreign Minister Laval's visit to Warsaw in the future will influence the future development of Poland's foreign policy. Poland has so far opposed all suggestions for the Eastern European Pact. Its final decision on this matter has a significant impact on the Anglo-French proposal of February 3, as it includes this pact. According to various newspapers, Poland seems to indicate its attitude before Eden leaves tomorrow. However, the conditions for its accession to the Pact must be carefully considered at the London or Stresa Conference. This condition was anticipated at the beginning of Eden's departure, and at that time it was clearly stated that all the information collected in the capitals would be thoroughly studied after Eden returned home. Tonight, Beck's dinner party for Eden was well attended by Polish officials and their wives. Beck gave a speech welcoming Eden, saying that the Polish people deeply appreciated the British government's goodwill in seeking to promote international relations and consolidate mutual trust. Poland is willing to cooperate. Eden replied that he believed that this trip would enable closer understanding between Britain and Poland. Both countries' policies are based on the principle of collective security and rely on the League of Nations. He believed that the very friendly talks made by both sides were very valuable because they could enable them to understand their obligations in the great work of international peace organization.

<p>Warsaw Minister Chang-er Eden declared that before leaving Warsaw this afternoon, he will also hold talks with the diplomatic representatives of France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia in Poland. This morning, Eden and Polish Foreign Minister Burke held their third meeting. He can arrive in the Czech capital tomorrow morning and hold talks with Czech Foreign Minister Beneš. The next day, he will return home by plane. By Friday, he will report the results of his visits to Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia to the cabinet in detail. So far, there has been no concrete development in the situation. A certain British official told the reporter of this agency, "The United Kingdom will ultimately believe that if the United Kingdom is unwilling to be a mediator and directly bear its responsibilities, then lasting peace in Europe will be impossible. However, in exchange, the countries of the European continent must also guarantee to the United Kingdom that neither the United Kingdom nor its territories will accept special restrictions on any particular area of Europe. In short, all problems are only in finding a formula for peace in Europe." In addition, British officials believe that the final solution will not go beyond two types. One is to have France and the Eastern European countries sign the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, excluding Germany and Poland, but allowing Germany and Poland to join in the future. The other is to conclude a broader pact that includes all European countries, including the United Kingdom. (Havas telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Warsaw Any compromise suggestions regarding the Eastern European Locarno Pact that Polish Foreign Minister Beck may have accepted during his talks with Eden are now believed to have been dismissed by Polish dictator General Pilsudski. Eden's talks with Beck ended at noon today. Eden will depart for Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, tonight and will discuss the general situation in Europe with Czech diplomats tomorrow morning. He is scheduled to fly back to London tomorrow afternoon. On Friday, he will report the results of his consultations with Russia, Poland, and the Czech Republic to the Cabinet. After Eden's meeting with Beck was over, the Polish authorities issued the following communiqué: Mr. Eden has given a detailed account of the exchange of views between the United Kingdom and Germany. In a harmonious discussion, the Foreign Minister briefly outlined Poland's views on the matters listed in the London communiqué of February 3 and on the general situation in Europe. Both sides agreed that this exchange of views was purely exploratory and had satisfactorily achieved its purpose. (Reuters telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Eden Proposes a Pan-European Pact</p>
<p>Warsaw Colonel Burke, Minister of Foreign Affairs, hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the British Lord Privy Seal Eden and the British delegation, and Burke gave a brief speech welcoming the guests, which was answered by Eden. According to the most reliable sources, Eden, because Poland seems unwilling to abandon its position between Germany and Russia and join the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, will propose a mutual assistance pact be concluded by all European countries, including the United Kingdom, on the condition that armaments are substantially reduced. Eden had two meetings with Burke this morning and afternoon, and visited General Pilsudski, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, in the evening. (Havas telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw It is believed in Polish official circles that Germany does not intend to participate in the Eastern European Pact under the current circumstances, so Poland cannot participate immediately. This news is said to have been issued after the meeting between the British Lord Privy Seal Eden and Polish Foreign Minister Beck. It is also learned that Poland is quite willing to participate in and cooperate with any peace movement, but because Poland is located in a vital area between Russia and Germany, it is particularly unwilling to sign the existing form of the Pact. It is said that what Beck opposes is the point that Germany will be rejected if it is unwilling to participate. Because of this, the result will be that Germany will be encircled. It is likely that Germany will not agree to the pact currently under discussion, so Polish official circles hope to modify it, and Poland must wait until after the modification before deciding what to do. At the same time, Eden is still continuing meetings with Beck. French Foreign Minister Laval also plans to stay in Warsaw for several days when he sets out for Russia to participate in the discussion. Observers say that regardless of whether the Eastern European Pact is established or not, Laval will probably make a concrete proposal for a Franco-Russian military alliance to the Soviet Union.

<p>Signs of Anglo-Russian Rapprochement Have Emerged</p>
<p>(London) Members of the British Parliament have a very favorable attitude towards the results of the talks between the United Kingdom and Russia. In general, signs of Anglo-Russian rapprochement have emerged, and it will not cause fierce opposition from the Conservative Party. The fact that the House of Commons is not eager to ask the government to explain the situation of the Moscow talks shows that the majority party has expressed goodwill towards the Anglo-Russian talks. (Havas telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Morning Post commented on Lord Privy Seal Eden's trip to Eastern Europe, saying, "People all over the world hope that Germany will realize that isolation is not a good plan and join the Eastern European Pact. Sooner or later, it does not matter. Therefore, the door to compromise must not be blocked. However, if Germany hesitates outside the door after all, the way to ensure peace is to unite the strength of other countries so that Germany does not dare to provoke." The Daily Telegraph said, "It is becoming increasingly clear that the Eastern European security problem cannot be solved by concluding regional agreements." The Daily Mail said, "Eden's trip was purely exploratory and failed to break the deadlock. It is not Eden's fault. It is hoped that French Foreign Minister Laval's trip to Eastern Europe will be successful." (Havas telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>It Is Difficult to Expect Approval for Germany's Proposal</p>
<p>(London) It is now learned that when German leader Hitler spoke with British Foreign Minister Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden in Berlin last week, he put forward a method to replace the Eastern European Pact. It is said that this proposal is to reiterate the theory of concluding non-aggression pacts separately, with the addition of clauses on ceasing assistance and supply to aggressor countries. This kind of pact can eventually be included in a multi-faceted non-aggression pact. However, according to the opinion of Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, this method may not be approved by France and Russia, because France and Russia are both members of the League of Nations, and according to the Kellogg Pact, which declares that it does not use war as an instrument of national policy, they have already assumed non-aggression. What Germany proposed is also not as thorough as Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, because this article stipulates that any country engaged in war should be regarded as an act of war against other members of the League of Nations, and other members will immediately sever all commercial and financial relations with it. In any case, France and Russia, who advocate the Eastern European Pact, will inevitably say that the existing non-aggression method is not enough to guarantee security.

<p>Press Comments on the Three-Four Conference</p>
<p>(London) The Italian Popolo d'Italia published a commentary today, stating that at the upcoming Stresa Conference, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy should specifically state that they hold a common view, and must further determine a common action program to deal with certain definite situations. People here believe that this commentary in the Italian Popolo d'Italia should be due to the instructions of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, so it is quite impressive. All the evening newspapers reprinted a summary of the article today. Political figures expressed that if the United Kingdom, France, and Italy can hold a unified view at the Stresa Conference, it would be a great wish, but the United Kingdom does not hope to take a definite attitude towards Germany in advance. If so, Berlin will regard it as Britain's hostility towards Germany. As for the pacts to guarantee Austria's independence and the Eastern European Pact, the extent to which the United Kingdom can participate seems to be only within the scope of consultation.

<p>Milan The diplomatic authorities of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are scheduled to hold an important international conference in Stresa on April 11, which is approaching. The city has now begun to prepare and arrange everything. The conference venue is probably inside the Palazzo Borromeo on Isola Bella near the city. There is a hall with an area of 250 square meters, which will be used as the venue. Prime Minister Mussolini will stay in the palace, while the British and French delegations will stay in the Grand Hotel Borromeo. (Havas telegram on the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Rome) Another incident occurred on the border between Italian Eritrea and Abyssinia on March 23. The Italian side claimed that Abyssinia attacked Italian sentries within Italian territory. The Abyssinian Embassy in Italy issued a statement today denying this. (Havas telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Abyssinian Embassy in Britain recently declared to the Daily Telegraph that the incident that occurred on the border between Italian Eritrea and Abyssinia on March 23 was a trap set by Italian troops. At that time, an Italian officer met an Abyssinian soldier and ordered him to hand over his guns. After he handed them over, the officer took advantage of his unpreparedness and killed him. The Abyssinian government has submitted a request to Italy, asking them to punish the murderer according to law. (Havas telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e43">French Prime Minister's Declaration in the Chamber of Deputies: Strengthen National Defense and Expand Armaments; Plans to Conclude Military Agreements and Maintain the Gold Standard; Chamber of Deputies Passes Vote of Confidence in the Government by a Majority <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies held its last meeting today before the holiday. Prime Minister Flandin attended and delivered a general policy statement. After that, the Chamber of Deputies announced its adjournment until it reopened on May 28. Flandin's declaration first stated that before Germany restored conscription, it had already established a compulsory labor system, the nature of which was no different from conscription. As for Germany's announcement of forming 36 army divisions, it has not yet included the air force and artillery. Under these circumstances, France has no choice but to take appropriate steps to increase national defense and must conclude military agreements with other countries that aim to maintain peace. In addition to strengthening border defenses, France will convene a Supreme National Defense Conference on April 5 to decide to continue training the new recruits who are due to be discharged this month to prevent accidents. If this matter is decided, the French standing army can be increased by 160,000 people. As for the previously passed bill to extend the term of military service, its purpose is only to supplement the standing army quota for the "gap year," which is temporary in nature. Now that Germany has restored conscription, as soon as the German military system is finally determined, the French military system must be re-examined before it can be said to be complete. Flandin then stated the situation of the treasury, saying that France's finances are completely sound and the gold standard can be maintained to the end. Finally, he said that France has applied to the Executive Council of the League of Nations to deal with Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles, hoping that the national debate will cooperate with the government more widely to provide diplomatic backing. After Flandin finished his speech, the Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the government by a large majority of 410 votes to 134. (Paris telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Minister of Aviation Tailon detailed the government's plan to strengthen the air force at the Air Defense Conference today, saying that the government plans to triple the tonnage of French bombers in the shortest possible time, double their range, and include all necessary purposes. Even in peacetime, the sky must be constantly defended. A team of the world's most modern pursuit aircraft will soon be established, equipped with the most sophisticated artillery. Heavy aircraft can now fly about 600 miles in one go. The government is now working hard to complete this task as soon as possible and will never slacken off. (Reuters telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Flandin's declaration in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday received overwhelming support. The newspapers expressed great satisfaction with it. Even the right-wing newspapers, which had adopted a reserved attitude towards Flandin for some time, now expressed sympathy. The newspapers believed that the government's authority would inevitably be expanded on the eve of the important international talks. Le Petit Parisien stated, "A summary of a policy should be done at any time, without having to make a fuss about it. It is satisfying that the French people can maintain a calm mind and have an unwavering belief in the future of the country." (Havas telegram on the 3rd)</p>

Now that Paraguay and Bolivia have reached an agreement, the Extraordinary Assembly of the League of Nations has lost its purpose for convening. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e48">US Senate Arms Committee Cancels War Profits Plan; Limits War Profiteering by Arms Dealers <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Arms Committee today completed its plan to eliminate war profits and will submit a report to the Senate. The plan includes the conscription of industry and manpower during wartime and a limit on individual income to no more than 10,000 yuan per year. The chairman of the committee is Progressive Republican Senator Nye. The report to be submitted this time is the most radical proposal in the US Congress. Although Nye had several conflicts with President Roosevelt during the investigation of the arms trade, it is said that the President has approved the plan to eliminate wartime profiteering and has declared that the magnitude of wartime profits is indescribable, especially for arms manufacturers, and that such profits should be thoroughly eliminated. However, some arms dealers are cooperating with the government, so if the Arms Committee wants its plan to pass, it may not have any other strong proposals besides suggesting that the government directly control all arms manufacturing plants. The President also strongly criticized the injustice of soldiers fighting abroad during the European War only receiving one yuan per day, while workers in the rear could earn eight to twenty yuan per day. Reactionary elements in Congress may oppose this plan, arguing that the poor performance of state-owned railways is an example of the ineffectiveness of state control compared to private management. (National Telegraph, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Arms Committee passed a bill late today stipulating that the state shall bear all the expenses of future wars to avoid burdening future generations. The bill was drafted by Nye, chairman of the Arms Committee. It will require the government to register the board of directors of major industries and treat them with the salary of a major general, about 8,000 yuan per year. According to the bill, the government will not be able to directly manage the arms industry, but it will control profits during wartime and force directors to take responsibility for the front line with their usual management skills. It is said that the latter clause can greatly alleviate the opposition of conservatives, because they stated that the government's takeover of the railways during the Great War was clear proof of the government's inability to manage private enterprises.

<p>Bern The kidnapping of German Overseas Chinese journalist Jakob, who was hiding in Basel, by the National Socialist Party has caused a national uproar, recognizing this as undermining Swiss sovereignty. Foreign Minister Motta read to the Parliament a copy of the note requesting Germany to return Jakob, his attitude was very indignant. This note has already been delivered to Germany. Jakob was arrested for leaking German military secrets and is now awaiting trial in a National Socialist prison, where he may be sentenced to death. Foreign Minister Motta declared that the kidnapping seriously damaged Swiss sovereignty and was enough to completely shake the fate of Switzerland. When the Swiss ambassador protested the National Socialist Party's actions on Saturday, German Foreign Minister Neurath opposed the return of Jakob, also claiming that the people of Basel recognized Weissmann as the instigator of Jakob's kidnapping and as the leader of the National Socialist secret organization "Gestapo." The purpose of organizing the Gestapo is to detect the actions of National Socialist Party fugitives throughout Europe. Moreover, Weissmann has admitted that on March 9, he lured Jakob from his hiding place in Switzerland and then handed him over to a National Socialist envoy, who transported him back to Germany in a high-speed car. Motta finally stated that he would report the matter to the World Court. It is now known that the government is preparing to apply to the League of Nations to handle the case.

<p>(London) Lord Peel will raise a motion in the House of Lords at 4 pm today, requesting the government to pay attention to the situation in the Far East and Sino-Japanese relations. A debate is expected. Eddington and others will speak for the government, and Lords Reading and Lytton will also likely express their opinions. Opposition peers will pay attention to the trend of the debate, and Lord Marley will be promoted to speak when necessary. It is generally believed that the mover, Lord Peel, advocates that Britain, in view of its far-reaching interests in China, its long-standing relationship with China, and its friendly relations with both China and Japan, should immediately try to assume the role of mediator between China and Japan to seek an agreement that can eliminate Chinese suspicions of Japanese intentions and enable China to carry out its economic development along its existing borders. Peel will also urge Britain to guarantee Japan its due position in the Chinese market and other satisfactory matters, so as to be in line with its special position in the Far East. Observers familiar with the situation in the Far East believe that Britain is best qualified to undertake such work, because Britain's motives are beyond doubt. If a meeting of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty is convened, it will inevitably resemble a trial of Japan, which will only vent hatred and be harmful to a peace agreement. If China and Japan conclude an agreement themselves, it may arouse deeper suspicions among overseas Chinese. Today's debate in the House of Lords will likely involve negotiations on loans to China, but according to observers, the first priority is to eliminate the shadows of suspicion and hatred that shroud the Far East.

Therefore, if China itself drafts a concrete plan for self-reliance, Japan is also prepared to consider loans if they are necessary for implementation. However, loans for military or other non-productive purposes are of no benefit to China itself. Therefore, even if other countries intend to provide loans, Japan will resolutely oppose them. 2. The proposal to send a survey team by various countries, as proposed by Britain, to investigate China's economic situation is also absolutely opposed. 3. Japan will purchase Chinese cotton and other agricultural products in large quantities, and in order to promote such production, Japan is prepared to provide technical assistance.

A member asked the main reason for the sharp decline in imports. Elliot replied that he could not know, but the government is currently considering this matter and will never discriminate against a certain batch of Chinese egg imports. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>Beiping Dispatch: The issue of rotating the "war zone" security force has been brewing for almost a year. Due to numerous entanglements, the implementation procedures are quite complicated. After the issue of transferring the security force of Yutian County, led by Feng Shoupeng, was resolved, the cleaning work in the "war zone" has gained momentum and is progressing smoothly. The matter of the newly organized security force entering the "war zone" is also nearing fruition. The deployment date can be determined in Tianjin tonight (the 2nd). Here is what we have heard:</p>
<p>Tianjin Meeting</p>
<p>During a plenary meeting of the "War Zone Cleanup Committee" last month, resolutions were passed. Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and Tao Shangming, the commissioner of the Luan-Yu area, arrived in Tianjin at the end of last month and held separate negotiations with representatives of the provincial government and the Japanese side, including Goujin and Ii. They have reached full agreement on the deployment of the newly organized security force. The provincial government has also telegraphed Zhang Yantian and Zhang Qingyu, the commanders of the first and second regiments of the newly organized security force, to come to Tianjin to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Seeking Instructions from He</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng, the commissioner of the Ji-Mi area, remained in Beiping to arrange the implementation work. This morning (the 2nd) at 9:00 AM, he went to Jurentang to meet with He Yingqin. In addition to reporting on the transfer of the Yutian security force and the thorough reorganization of illegal militias, he also gave a detailed account of the recent work of the "War Zone Cleanup Committee." Subsequently, he sought instructions on all matters concerning the deployment of the newly organized security force. He gave detailed instructions. Yin left around 11:00 AM and immediately took the Ping-Yu express train departing from Beiping at 1:15 PM to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Banquet at Ning Garden</p>
<p>Yin Tong held a banquet at Beining Park this afternoon (the 2nd) at 7:00 PM. Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, Zhang Yantian, and Zhang Qingyu attended. Zhu Shiqin, a section chief of the Military Affairs Commission, was also invited but did not attend due to official business. According to reliable sources, Yin Tao and others will finalize the deployment date of the newly organized security force at the banquet in Ning Garden. After the date is set, preparations for the deployment, such as vehicle scheduling, deployment routes, and the allocation of personnel and weapons, will be discussed in accordance with the agreement with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Prior Inspection</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming have tentatively scheduled to go to Beicang and Caicun on the 4th or 6th of this month to inspect the new security force. Representatives from the provincial government will also participate. During the inspection, speeches will be given to encourage them. After the inspection, preparations for the move will begin. The first regiment, led by Zhang Yantian, is currently stationed in Beicang. In the future, they will take a special train on the Beining Railway from their current location to various stations along the Ji-Yu area, and then transfer to automobiles to reach their destinations in various counties. The number of personnel is 2,500. The second regiment, led by Zhang Qingyu, is stationed in Caicun, and their number of personnel is also 2,500. In the future, they will transfer from Beiping to various counties in the Luan-Mi area. However, due to insufficient vehicles, except for the more distant counties, which will travel by automobile, the rest will march on foot.</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng's Talk</p>
<p>According to Yin Rugeng, the commissioner of the Ji-Mi area, who spoke to reporters this morning (the 2nd) after meeting with He Yingqin, he sought instructions. After the deployment of the newly organized security force is completed in the future, there will be much reorganization work within the "war zone." The so-called reorganization is purely internal, such as the reorganization of the militias in each county and the reorganization of the public security bureaus in each county, which are all urgent tasks. Without this, the security within the "war zone" will be difficult to improve. Secondly, the cleanup in Yutian County and the anti-banditry work after the green crops appear are also things that should be done. Only after everything in the "war zone" is on track can construction be discussed. The issue of receiving Leling will be carried out after the above matters are completed step by step. It is believed that in the foreseeable future, the cleanup work in the "war zone" can come to an end. (February 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Qingdao Citizens' Thrift and Savings Campaign; The Purpose of Thrift and Savings Is Not Only for Individuals, But Also to Increase National Productivity <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the establishment of the preparatory committee for the city's thrift and savings campaign, it has held several meetings, and successively passed the campaign plan, the organizational outline of the thrift alliance, and the campaign declaration. Mayor Shen Honglie was specially appointed as the honorary president, Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng as the president, and the heads of various bureaus and stations as the vice presidents. The opening ceremony was held at the YMCA at 3:00 PM on March 31, with more than a hundred representatives from all walks of life attending. The meeting was extremely enthusiastic. The campaign lasted for a week, with famous people invited to give lectures every night, and lecture groups also went to the city and suburbs during the day to explain the meaning of thrift and savings to persuade people. The grand opening and the organizational outline of the thrift alliance are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Opening</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Lin Fengqi gave the opening speech, stating that it is a good phenomenon that the citizens of this city are promoting the thrift campaign under the current environment. The purpose of thrift and savings is not only for individuals, but mainly to increase national productivity, enrich the national economy, and is extremely important for the future of the country. He expressed his gratitude to Mayor Shen and other officials for their guidance and expressed his expectation that there would be new progress within this week. Next, Mayor Shen gave a speech, stating that he was very interested in attending the opening ceremony of the thrift and savings campaign today. When he was in the navy, he also promoted diligence and thrift, and specially established the Diligence and Aspiration Society, which all soldiers joined. Every month, in addition to personal expenses and supporting their families, all the remaining money was saved. Later, because he was busy, he could not take care of it, and the matter failed. After he became the mayor, he still did not slack off in this matter, established the Diligence and Improvement Association, and established supply and entertainment clubs to promote noble entertainment for civil servants, hoping to cultivate good habits, but unfortunately the results were still minimal. There are two reasons for the failure: first, because this matter was mostly passive, it could not last, and there was no joint organization, it was easily moved by the environment; second, because the national character of our country is loose, individuals have no plans. Because he learned from the failures of the past, he only focused on the actual situation of his subordinates and promoted the "three no's and three yes's" doctrine. The three no's are: no whoring, no gambling, no drug abuse; the three yes's are: yes to reading, yes to exercise, yes to cooperation. The thrift and savings campaign promoted by the YMCA is in line with his intentions. Therefore, he is interested in this matter. He described the failures of the past in order to study the rescue methods for this matter and make sure to get good results. Rescue methods can be divided into two aspects, the official aspect can be divided into broad and narrow. The broad sense belongs to education, such as promoting reading, exercise, noble entertainment, etc., making them have the spirit of getting rid of bad habits, cultivating good habits, and good learning. The narrow sense belongs to material, in the future, the city government civil servants will also imitate other methods to be frugal and thrifty in order to save money, and promote frugality and thrift by example. The two aspects, the official aspect and the people's aspect, must work hard to promote. The people should increase production as much as possible and create wealth to meet the needs of society. Merchants should take the overall situation into consideration and not sell foreign goods, so as to prevent leaks. In Qingdao, merchants are more important than farmers and workers. In a narrow sense, it is thrift and savings. However, it is not difficult to carry out thrift campaigns among farmers and workers, because farmers and workers are usually very frugal and do not wait to be persuaded. What is difficult is the intellectual class. The YMCA has initiated this meeting, and most of the participants are intellectuals. In the future, it is hoped that all the intellectuals in the city will be gathered together, and various methods will be used to unite them. Do not just talk about this matter, but practice it, then the future of the country may be hopeful. After the speech, Hu Jiafeng, the chairman, and Li Shiliao, the standing committee member of the city party department, gave speeches successively, and then took pictures and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>Alliance Outline</p>
<p>The purpose of this alliance is to promote personal thrift and savings, eliminate various wasteful habits in material and spirit, and thus improve economic life. Anyone who agrees with the purpose of this alliance and is willing to practice it can join as a basic ally. The allies of this alliance are divided into groups of ten people, and are numbered from the first group to the nth group in the order of their establishment. (Each group pushes one representative to organize a representative assembly as the highest authority. Each ally must introduce at least ten people to form a group. This alliance has a number of promotion committee members who organize a promotion committee to lead the worship of the alliance under the guidance of the group representative assembly. The first promotion committee is organized by the basic allies, and the second and subsequent committees are organized by the group representative assembly. The term of office of the group representatives and promotion committee members is one year, and they can be re-elected. Allies must abide by the alliance agreement in their personal life and in their interactions with other allies. The alliance agreement will be determined separately. Separate saving methods will be implemented for public life, banquets, gift-giving, and holidays. This alliance can establish special agreements with savings institutions, insurance institutions, and other stores to facilitate the allies. Various detailed rules for the promotion committee and the group of ten people will be determined separately. This outline will be implemented after being approved by the general meeting of basic allies. If there are any unfulfilled matters, it can be revised by the group representative assembly.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Japan's Siwen Society Invites Descendants of Sages to Japan to Participate in the Completion Ceremony of the Confucius Temple; Provincial Government Will Select Representatives to Attend <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Japan's Siwen Society, in order to rebuild the Yushima Confucius Temple, has set the completion ceremony to be held in Tokyo on the 28th of this month. Because Confucius was a native of Lu, and the descendants of the four sages, Yan Hui, Zeng Shen, Zisi, and Mencius, are mostly in Shandong, they have specially invited Kong Decheng, the official in charge of the worship of Confucius, Kong Lingcan, a descendant of Confucius, one descendant of each of the four sages, and famous people from various places to participate. The Japanese consul in Jinan, Nishida, has asked the provincial authorities for permission to go. If the direct descendants of the sages cannot participate in person, they are requested to send one representative each. The authorities, considering this matter to be of great importance, have requested instructions from the central government. Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan telegraphed Lu on the 26th of last month. On the 30th, the authorities received telegrams from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, stating that the candidates for the descendants of the sages and Confucian scholars should be selected by the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Education, and their resumes should be submitted to the ministry for approval. The Shandong Provincial Government believes that the candidates for the descendants of each sage should be selected by the Department of Education and the Department of Civil Affairs, and one or two experienced representatives of the sages with diplomatic knowledge, and two to four representatives of Confucian scholars, should be selected and their resumes should be submitted to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education for joint approval. This was resolved at the provincial administrative meeting today (the 2nd), and the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Education were ordered to handle it accordingly. It is reported that Kong Decheng, the official in charge of the worship of Confucius, and Kong Lingcan, a descendant of Confucius, have decided not to participate in person. As for the descendants of the four sages, except for Zisi, who is directly related to Confucius, and Zeng Shen, who will not send anyone to participate, Yan and Mencius will be allowed to send representatives to Japan to participate. It is likely that no Confucian scholars will go. The descendants of each sage are currently studying the selection of representatives. After the provincial government selects them, they will go to Beijing to receive instructions before going to Japan. (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Boundary Dispute Between Guangdong and Guangxi Resolved; Two Provinces Send Commissioners to Survey and Agree on Two Methods of Demarcation <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The boundary between Qin County in the southern part of Guangdong Province and Yong County in Guangxi Province is contiguous. Recently, boundary disputes have occurred in border villages, and the situation is deadlocked. The county governments of each county have submitted reports to their superiors for handling. The provincial governments of the two provinces sent officials to survey the boundary to resolve the disputes. Recently, Hu Jixian, a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and Lei Yin, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Guangxi Province, were ordered to go to the border area between Qin and Yong to inspect. The results of the meeting are as follows: It is found that the county chronicles of the two counties are different, and the surveys by the two provinces last year were inconsistent. Recently, the reports from both sides are also different. In order to thoroughly resolve this, the Southwest Political Affairs Council will send members to lead two surveying members from each province to remeasure the boundary between the two counties and the location of nearby cities and villages, so as to solve the problem once and for all. Before the Southwest Political Affairs Council approves the boundary line, everything should remain as it is, and neither side should create trouble. The county magistrates of the two counties should be responsible for instructing the township heads in their jurisdictions to guarantee that there will be no armed conflicts and that various transportation projects will not be hindered or damaged. The seventeen villages of the Qin nationality in the Sanguan area of Yong County are too far from the Qin County government, and its reach is too short. Qin County can send officials to be stationed there permanently to be responsible for managing the people there in regards to smoking, gambling, theft, smuggling, tax evasion, and other matters, and cooperate with the Yongning County government to take consistent actions. It is not necessary to plan to establish a market near Chenna in the seventeen villages, as it will only increase the resentment of the residents of Chenna. It should be stopped to resolve the dispute and wait quietly for a solution. The regulations on the establishment of markets and traffic and education in the bandit areas interspersed between the two provinces are as follows: Within ten miles of the original market, the people of the two provinces shall not establish another market. When establishing a new market more than ten miles away from the original market, the following conditions must be met: First, the market days must not be the same. Second, all taxes and fees in the newly established market, such as taxes on slaughtering pigs, cattle, tobacco, alcohol, stamp duty, and business tax, must be handled in accordance with the county's jurisdiction, and the tax rate must be the same. Third, with regard to the management of smoking, gambling, theft, smuggling, and tax evasion in the market, we should cooperate with the county government to take consistent actions. The construction of telephone lines is for the convenience of traffic, and no one shall object to or damage it on any pretext. With regard to highways, if they are provincial roads in the two provinces, they should be handled by the provincial governments of both provinces through consultation. If they are county roads and township roads, they should be handled by the county governments of both provinces through consultation. The people shall not object on any pretext. As for the township roads in the county, if they pass through the interspersed bandit area after being approved by the county government, the people along the line in the interspersed bandit area shall not object to or damage them on any pretext. With regard to educational matters, if the people in the interspersed bandit area cannot set up schools independently, they can send their children to nearby schools, but they should bear the same obligations as the local people with regard to the construction equipment of the school and the expenses of the school. Guangxi Province has telegraphed its approval of the above measures and requested that the Guangdong government sign it jointly. The original telegram said, "Regarding the dispute over the boundary between Chenna Market in Yong and Qin Counties, Commissioner Hu Jixian of your government arrived in Yong, and this government sent Commissioner Lei Yin to inspect the market together. Commissioner Hu and Commissioner Lei signed two methods, one is to demarcate the boundary between the two sides, and the other is to stipulate the methods for maintaining the boundary in the future. This government considers it to be appropriate. In addition to keeping one copy, Commissioner Hu took the remaining copy back to be submitted for approval. It is hoped that your government will approve it, and the people of the two provinces will benefit greatly." (March 30)</p>

<p>The fire brigade members of this county, because Yao and Li, two comrades, were wronged, aroused public outrage and submitted a total resignation, handing over the fire fighting equipment in each district to the Fire Association to show their determination. This has been reported in previous newspapers. After this case occurred, County Magistrate Jin, Wang, the Standing Committee member of the Party Department, District Chief Li, and Cai, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, considering the importance of fire fighting in Kailing City, invited responsible representatives from each district to the County Chamber of Commerce last night and sincerely requested their reinstatement. It took several hours to conclude. The District Public Office of the Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to the citizens, stating that Yao and Li, two members of the fire brigade, were suddenly accused in the Songhu Villa incident and were given a suspended sentence by the Shanghai District Court. The County Party Department and the County Government considered the importance of local fire fighting and invited members of the fire brigades in each district, Wang, the Standing Committee member, County Magistrate Jin, Cai, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and District Chief Li, to persuade them again and again. The members said that the fire brigade comrades originally served the local public interest. Yao and Li, two members of the fire brigade, were unjustly wronged and sentenced. They were disheartened and unwilling to sacrifice their spirit and work hard for something that was unrewarding. However, they were sincerely persuaded by Wang, the Standing Committee member, County Magistrate Jin, Cai, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and District Chief Li, and they considered that if there were a fire and no one to rescue them due to their resignation, the local people would suffer a great loss. The comrades were unwilling to do so, so they maintained the spirit of serving the local community in the past, sacrificed everything, and reluctantly maintained their positions on the 3rd of this month. The case of Yao and Li will still proceed in accordance with legal procedures in order to achieve equality in both sentiment and law. The association stated that it was fortunate for the local area that the members took the overall situation into consideration, and it was feared that the citizens were not fully aware of this, so they issued this notice. All fire fighting equipment has been sent back by the County Party Department, the County Government, the District Public Office, and the County Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>Lujiang River in the fourth district is an important passage to the lake. It is being dredged by Zhu, the district chief, who is responsible for the project. The entire river is divided into five sections, and about 3,800 villagers are working on the project. Since the start of construction on the 11th of last month, some parts have been completed, accounting for two-fifths of the total. The fourth class of the fourth Bao of Zhangshe Town is responsible for dredging the Niugang section. Yesterday, because the mud was difficult to walk on, they took several bundles of straw from Lujiang Village to use as foot rests, but without the consent of the villagers. A quarrel broke out with the women of the village. Then, the men and women of the village threw stones into the river. The villagers of Zhangshe Town could not bear it and an armed fight broke out. The security police rushed to the scene but could not stop it. They fired warning shots into the air before the crowd dispersed. At that time, more than 20 people were injured on both sides. In addition, a villager named Zou Jinhai, who was trying to mediate, was also beaten and his arm was broken. Afterwards, Jiang Shichu, the chief of the fourth Bao of Zhangshe Town, and Jiang Axi, the head of the fourth class, reported the situation to District Chief Zhu, who convened a meeting of both sides to persuade the villagers of Zhangshe Town to continue working. Each of the injured people on both sides would be given one yuan by the District Chief as medical expenses to quell the dispute.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province is carrying out a disaster relief project, dredging the Zhenchang-Xixi Canal, and has allocated 1 million yuan in water conservancy bonds. The Zhenchang section has already started and is being carried out in stages. Tents have been set up along the canal for the workers to live in. The Wuxi section starts from Shouxing Wharf in the west of Wumu and ends at Shilulu Bridge in Luoshe Town, a total length of five kilometers (about nine li). Dams have also been built in stages to actively draw water. The dam of the Chen Gong Port tributary suddenly collapsed a few days ago. The Luoshe Supervision Office tried its best to block it, and it was finally closed that night, with only minor losses. The county government has ordered the district chiefs to recruit workers, stipulating that each Bao should send ten workers, with a daily wage of one jiao. Therefore, the villagers are very enthusiastic about working on the project.</p>

<p>Last year's drought caused the most damage to Yi and Li counties. This spring, refugees from the two counties, supporting the old and carrying the young, came to Changzhou to seek food. There are no less than several thousand people in the Ximen area. Local people, such as Lin Qiaobao, donated money to provide steamed buns and thin porridge to provide relief.

<p>The rice merchants here, in opposition to the Business Tax Bureau and the provincial inspectors' auditing and tax increases, have triggered a county-wide rice merchant strike. It has been two days and has yet to be resolved. The public has nowhere to buy rice and is very panicked. Barge crews, grain measurers, and sack loaders, all of whom rely on the daily activity of the rice market for their livelihood, have also become unemployed due to the rice market strike. On the morning of the second day, five to six hundred workers gathered and paraded through the bustling streets, going to the Party headquarters, the Business Tax Bureau, and the county government to petition for three demands: to immediately persuade the rice merchants to resume business so that livelihoods can be maintained; to abolish the investigation of accounts of various industries; and to dismiss the Finance Department committee member Liu, who caused this incident. Various departments responded separately. County Chief Zhai also addressed the crowds. In the afternoon of the second day, Party and government organizations held a discussion to resolve the issue. The solution decided was to convene a meeting with the rice industry leaders at 2:00 PM on the third day, urging them to resume business first. As for the tax reduction issue, the Chamber of Commerce Chairman Pang Jiegong and the Business Tax Bureau Chief Wu Zongbao were instructed to discuss solutions and submit them to the department for approval.</p>

<p>Huang Shourong from Wangyang Village in the Sixth District has no fixed property and does not engage in legitimate work. He associates with bandits. In 1927, he colluded with others to kidnap Gong Yunsheng, a wealthy household in the district. Because the extortion was unsuccessful, Gong was killed and the body was destroyed to eliminate evidence. Gong's son, Gong Zuying, reported the case to the county government and offered a reward of five hundred yuan for his capture, but to no avail. In the spring of 1931, he led more than thirty bandits to rob the homes of Niu Zhuqiao, Fan Cunyi, and Sha Ruixiang, setting fire to more than ten houses. The victims reported to the county government, which sent officials to verify the facts and ordered a strict arrest. Huang, seeing that the situation was not good, hid in Shanghai. Now he has secretly returned home, plotting an uprising. Yesterday (the 31st), the county government learned of this, secretly instructed the Public Security Bureau to send police to arrest him. That night, Chen, the judge, opened a court to interrogate him and ordered him to be shackled and imprisoned.</p>

<p>Last year, there was a drought in the western regions of Haiyan, and more than three thousand refugees stayed in the eastern part of this county. The Charity Association and others provided rice porridge daily and sent them back to their hometowns half a month ago. Unexpectedly, there have recently been rumors that Pinghu will soon distribute grain seeds and that wealthy people from Shanghai have raised large sums of money to be distributed in the coming days. As a result, the refugees who had dispersed have regrouped inside and outside the city. Over seven thousand arrived the day before yesterday, and over three thousand arrived yesterday, with more arriving continuously. The area around Lugong Bridge in the eastern part of the city is filled with them. The Charity Association urgently cooked the remaining rice into thin porridge for temporary relief, but unfortunately, there was too little porridge and too many people to reach everyone. Today, the cake shop in front of the Great King Temple was looted by the disaster victims. A rural woman carrying dozens of dozens of foreign socks went to the factory to exchange them for money, but was pushed down and robbed. All the socks were taken in an instant. The county's task force and public security police went to suppress the situation and detained one disaster victim for interrogation.</p>

<p>Hou Yunhan, a teacher at Chezhu Primary School in Chezhu Township, Changxing, and Qin Ruizheng, a female teacher at Lijia Lane Primary School outside the East Gate, fell in love and planned to marry. However, Qin's mother insisted on a bride price of four hundred yuan. Hou's income was meager and he could not afford it. On the 30th of last month, he borrowed money to go to the city and opened room 11 of the Datong Hotel. The two wrote several suicide notes, and both committed suicide with sickles. The scene was bloody and tragic. The case has been reported to the authorities, and the family has arranged for coffins and burial.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Ningbo: Robbery and Murder at Tiantong Temple <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Tiantong Temple in Zhengdong is a famous temple in eastern Zhejiang with flourishing incense and offerings. The surrounding scenery is excellent, and tourists abound. Recently, a merchant from Shanghai and Ningbo, Wang Jinfu, brought his family to the temple to perform a Buddhist ceremony. The gold and jewels were dazzling, and the costumes were extravagant, which attracted the attention of bandits. The day before yesterday (the 31st), at around 5 PM, five bandits wearing blue and yellow long gowns entered the temple, carrying four box guns and one Browning rifle. They claimed to be there to perform Buddhist rituals and mingled with the worshippers. After dinner, they forcibly demanded money from the treasury. At that time, the abbot, Yuan Ying, was not in the temple. The receptionist monk, Benquan, resisted, which angered the bandits, who opened fire and shot him. He was hit in the chest and died on the spot. A worker, Changshouliang, was shot in the leg. After about an hour, the bandits looted more than a hundred silver dollars stored in the temple treasury, as well as eight gold and jewelry rings and more than three hundred yuan of paper money from Wang Jinfu's family, and fled through the back door. The next morning, the victim reported the case to the Fifth Public Security Sub-bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Tang Xifen Discusses Past London Art Exhibitions <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Pre-exhibition of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art, which has been in preparation for a long time, has been properly arranged and is scheduled to open on the 8th. A Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Tang Xifen, the secretary of the exhibition, yesterday to inquire about everything. He kindly provided detailed information about each country's art exhibition held in London, which can be used for our reference and learning, as well as the details of the pre-exhibition. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Seven Times</p>
<p>According to him, the Burlington House of the Royal Academy of Arts in England has successively held international art exhibitions for Finland, the Netherlands, Italy, Persia, France, and Britain in recent years. The Chinese art exhibition, which will be held in November of this year, will be the seventh.</p>
<p>Purpose of Holding</p>
<p>The reason why countries do not hesitate to hold large-scale international art exhibitions in England is mainly to reflect the spiritual sustenance of various ethnic groups over the years and to express the achievements of their creative abilities, so that visitors can understand the corresponding status of various ethnic groups, thereby promoting international friendship and obtaining huge political, economic, and even commercial benefits. Its value has already been established and should not be doubted in the slightest.</p>
<p>Past Experiences</p>
<p>The holding of international art exhibitions in England began with Finland in 1927, and the exhibition lasted about eight weeks. The second was the Netherlands in 1929, with a similar duration as Finland. Then there were Italy (1930), Persia (1931), France (1932), and Britain (1934). The exhibitions lasted either ten weeks or nine weeks, but the difference was not significant.</p>
<p>Each Organization</p>
<p>Generally, the heads of state of the two countries serve as supervisors, the administrative leaders of the two countries serve as honorary presidents, and important political figures and social celebrities from the two countries serve as honorary committee members. In addition, there is a board of directors composed of the initiators and the main institutions providing exhibits from each country and the Royal Academy of Arts in England to execute and direct everything. Under the board of directors, there are committees for display, finance, and selection to handle various matters. At the same time, in order to widely collect exhibits, solicitation committees are established separately in various countries.</p>
<p>Source of Funds</p>
<p>Most of the funds come from ticket sales. The ticket price is five shillings (about seven yuan in Chinese currency) on Fridays, and one shilling and six pence (about two and a half yuan in Chinese currency) on other days. Each art exhibition has a surplus after deducting all expenses. When Italy held the international art exhibition, Prime Minister Mussolini had pre-allocated 20,000 pounds, but in the end, not a penny was used, and a surplus of 37,000 pounds was obtained.</p>
<p>Exhibiting Institutions</p>
<p>Generally, the treasures collected by museums run by the countries and provinces are the main exhibits, and the collections of various groups and individuals are solicited to supplement them. For example, the international art exhibition held by Persia collected exhibits from more than 200 museums, libraries, and more than 30 countries. In addition, there were more than 300 pieces of private exhibits.</p>
<p>Number of Exhibits</p>
<p>It is difficult for each country to have the same number of exhibits. Generally speaking, it is between 1,000 and 2,000 pieces.</p>
<p>Types of Exhibits</p>
<p>The types of exhibits in each country's art exhibition are extremely diverse, and they are not entirely the same in each country. In addition to books, bronzes, porcelains, jade articles, etc., there are also pottery, goldware, silverware, glassware, textiles, wood carvings, lace, furniture, sculptures, etc.</p>
<p>Era of Exhibits</p>
<p>The exhibits from France and Italy range from 1200 to 1900. Other countries are roughly the same. However, Persia is an ancient civilization, so there are many prehistoric exhibits.</p>
<p>Other Activities</p>
<p>In addition to the exhibition itself, each country's art exhibition also has other subsidiary activities to promote publicity. There are usually three ways: first, experts give lectures on the culture and art of each country; second, famous music from each country is played. Both of the above two require separate admission tickets. Third, commemorative albums and exhibit catalogs are sold, and famous book plates of collotype and copper prints are sold. The above sections are the general situation of the international art exhibitions held by various countries in England. As for the purpose and organization of our country's exhibition, they are roughly the same.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Mu Li Tusi's Petition Representatives Pass Through Shanghai, Scheduled to Go to Beijing This Morning to Petition <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Mu Li Nine Tribes Tusi, located at the intersection of Sichuan, Kang, and Yunnan provinces, and under the jurisdiction of Yanyuan County in Sichuan, due to being unable to bear Liu Wenhui's brutality, specifically sent representatives Xi Luo Jixiang, along with religious representative Yue Wu Yeda, and public representative Song Nuo Jize, three people, to Beijing to petition. When they left Sichuan, Liu's troops conducted extremely strict inspections, and they suffered many hardships along the way. They arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and are staying at the Ping An Hotel in the French Concession. Due to the fatigue of the journey, Mr. Yue Wu Yeda is feeling slightly unwell and is temporarily resting at the hotel. Yesterday, Mr. Xie Jiewu accompanied Xi Luo Jixiang and Song Nuo Jize to the hotel, and discussed with reporters Liu's oppression of the Tusi. Mr. Xi Luo Jixiang does not understand Chinese, and although Mr. Song Nuo Jize can speak Chinese, he is not very fluent, so Mr. Xie translated on their behalf. The two gentlemen were dressed entirely in Han Chinese clothing, and were polite and courteous. They said that they would go to Beijing this morning to petition the authorities. During the conversation, they produced their mimeographed draft telegram and asked for it to be announced on their behalf. Before leaving, they performed a religious ceremony, clasped their hands together, and bowed. The original text is recorded as follows: To all national agencies, legal entities, newspapers, and all fathers, brothers, sisters, and aunts across the country for your information. The Mu Li Nine Tribes Tusi, located in Yanyuan County, southern Sichuan, at the intersection of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Kang provinces, is the gateway to the three provinces. Since submitting to the Qing Dynasty during the Kangxi period, for more than three hundred years, they have lived in peace. Since the founding of the Republic of China, Sichuan has been plagued by constant turmoil. The authorities have abused the border people, treating them as uncivilized outsiders. No one has cared about any administrative measures. As a result, banditry has become increasingly rampant, and the people are living in misery. Our Mu Li Nine Tribes Tusi, witnessing the difficulties of the times, are deeply concerned. Considering the importance of border defense, they have strived to find ways to defend themselves. For the past twenty years, they have finally relied on the collective efforts of the people to avoid collapse. After Liu Wenhui's defeat and retreat to Ya'an in the twenty-first year, more than ten thousand of his troops were scattered throughout southern Sichuan, and Mu Li Nine Tribes was also occupied. Arbitrary donations and miscellaneous taxes were imposed repeatedly, and the people have long groaned under oppression, living a life worse than death. Recently, Liu has even rashly listened to rumors and coveted the wealth of Mu Li, ordering the Tusi to hand over gold mines and sending troops to mine them. Since the Donglao Mountain mine was empty and the work yielded little results, he not only did not repent, but instead vented his anger on the Mu Li Tusi, forcing them to point out other gold-producing locations and demanding compensation for losses of 200,000 taels of silver. In the future, the monthly salaries and food expenses of the factory troops should be borne by the Tusi, otherwise he would launch a large-scale punitive expedition to interrogate them. This kind of absurd order was relayed by Shen Hong, the magistrate of Yanyuan County. After hearing the order, the Tusi were terrified and at a loss. They immediately sent leaders to Yanyuan, requesting Magistrate Shen to intercede on their behalf. Magistrate Shen replied in a letter, stating that the original order of 200,000 taels was equivalent to 280,000 yuan in foreign currency, but 130,000 yuan could be reduced, and they still had to pay 150,000 yuan quickly. The order was like a mountain, and they must not provoke his anger, etc. They then sent leaders several times to beg for leniency, but were not granted permission. Military force was used to oppress them, and the situation was tense. It was as if they would live if they had money, and die if they did not. The extent of their cruelty to the people was extreme. The general public was filled with resentment and repeatedly thought of taking the risk of fleeing to avoid this calamity. However, the Tusi had received the grace of the state for generations and could not bear to abandon their homeland lightly and be ridiculed by foreigners. Therefore, they tried to persuade the public to endure for a while and simultaneously appealed to the central government to await legal action. However, Liu Wenhui, with the heart of a beast, had long disregarded the country. Hearing that the Tusi had submitted a petition to the central government, he was enraged and sent his henchman Li Zhangfu to lure Xiang Ci Chengzha, the Mu Li Yiwei Si, who was directly appointed by the central government, and assassinate him at a meeting place. He then kidnapped the current Mu Li Tusi Zha Ba Songdian and imprisoned him in Yanyuan County as a hostage. Not only did he not reduce any of the previous debts, but he also forced them to hand over 500 large rifles, 40 small rifles, and 60,000 rounds of ammunition, and threatened to execute the Mu Li Tusi if they did not comply. The Tusi, witnessing this brutality, felt even more grief, and the people of the Nine Tribes were even more in imminent danger. Therefore, they convened a general assembly of the Nine Tribes' customs and people to discuss solutions. After deliberation, three matters were decided, which are now tearfully reported to the officials of our government and compatriots across the country: (1) Send representatives to Beijing to petition, demanding that the central government punish Liu Wenhui, who arbitrarily killed central government officials, in order to redress the grievances of Xiang Ci Chengzha and comfort the hopes of the monks and people of the Nine Tribes. (2) Request the central government to order Liu Wenhui to immediately release Zha Ba Songdian and ensure his safety, and return him to Mu Li to govern. All of Liu's troops should withdraw from Mu Li without exception and not use mining as an excuse to trample on the borderlands. (3) The people of the Nine Tribes vow to be irreconcilable with Liu Wenhui. Request the central government to clearly delineate the Mu Li Nine Tribes Tusi territory under the jurisdiction of Yunnan Province and permanently sever its relationship with Sichuan. As the ancients said, "Cherish us, we will follow; abuse us, we will hate." Liu Wenhui's treatment of Mu Li can truly be described as irreconcilable. Our border people can hardly bear to serve him with a smile and be ridiculed by the world. The above three points are the fundamental plan, and we hope that the officials of our government and compatriots across the country will uphold their spirit of supporting the weak, advocate justice, speak out righteously, and rescue us so that we can escape from fire and water and ascend to a comfortable seat. This will not only be the fortune of the Nine Tribes but also admired by all sides, for upholding laws and protecting the territory lies herein. The people of Mu Li Nine Tribes have reached the extreme point of anger. If the situation is not reported, and they take the risk of causing chaos, then the region will be troubled from now on, and the nation's border defenses will be lost.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits Urgent Request to Ministry of Finance to Quickly Allocate Funds to Aid Industry and Commerce, Bank of China Increases Official Shares, Submits Receipt to Ministry, Bank of Communications Schedules Regular Shareholders' Meeting <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have decided to make every effort to aid industry and commerce after increasing their capital. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry, asking for the quick allocation of funds to handle industrial and commercial credit small loans. The Bank of China returned 10 million yuan to the Ministry, and the Bank of Communications scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Bank of China Returns 10 Million Yuan to Ministry</p>
<p>After receiving instructions from the Ministry of Finance and accepting the resolutions of the 18th Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Bank of China decided to return two of the five notes of the 25 million yuan financial public bonds of the Republic of China given by the Ministry on the 28th of last month, totaling 10 million yuan, and simultaneously filled out a receipt for 15 million yuan in official shares. As for Article 2 of the regulations, the revised total amount of share capital is 50 million yuan, divided into 500,000 shares, each share being 100 silver yuan, with 300,000 official shares and 200,000 commercial shares. Now, it is decided to revise it again to 40 million yuan, divided into 400,000 shares, with 200,000 official shares and 200,000 commercial shares, to be submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the National Government for promulgation.</p>
<p>Bank of Communications to Hold Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>The total amount of share capital of the Bank of Communications is 10 million yuan, with 8 million yuan in commercial shares and 2 million yuan in official shares. After the Ministry of Finance allocated 10 million yuan in financial public bonds of the Republic of China as official shares, the regulations have also been revised, and the number of directors and managing directors has been increased. The Bank of Communications has scheduled to hold this shareholders' meeting at 1:00 PM on April 20 at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road. In addition to the business report, the increase of shares will also be discussed. The term of office of the twelve commercial share directors has not expired, so they will remain the same. However, the term of office of the four commercial share supervisors has expired and should be re-elected immediately. As for the increase in official share directors and supervisors, it will be appointed by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Three Banks Make Every Effort to Aid the Market</p>
<p>The Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, in order to aid the market, had designated a large amount of money at the end of 1934 for the use of interbank lending. After increasing their capital, they decided to expand it as much as possible. Although it is directly for the banking industry, it is indirectly for industry and commerce. It is rumored that the two banks have organized a syndicate to handle industrial and commercial mortgages. According to Xin Sheng News Agency reporters, the three banks have not made this decision, and the Bank of China and Bank of Communications have already joined the industrial and commercial credit loan syndicate.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Submits Urgent Request for Allocation of Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a letter to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Submitting for request. On the 2nd of this month, according to a letter from the industry and commerce sector, in order to aid industry and commerce, two emergency plans to aid industry and commerce were drafted and sent to your esteemed chamber for review. Subsequently, a letter was received stating that regarding industrial and commercial credit small loans, four outlines of measures for industrial and commercial credit small loans were discussed and drafted in consultation with local associations and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for adoption and implementation. This demonstrated sincerity and was greatly admired. Later, it was repeatedly reported that these measures had been approved by the Banking Association and would soon be implemented. However, many days have passed, and there is still no sign of implementation. The content and measures have not been made public, causing much anxiety among industry and commerce colleagues. Therefore, another letter is specially submitted, hoping for a detailed reply so that it can be relayed to reassure the people, with endless gratitude, etc., to the Chamber. Upon investigation, this matter was transferred by the affiliated association and the local association based on the request of the said association. The Chamber drafted four outlines of measures for industrial and commercial credit small loans and submitted them to your ministry on the 13th of this month, requesting adoption and implementation. However, no approval has been received yet. It should be noted that Article 3 of the original draft outline stipulates that the amount guaranteed by the government is tentatively set at 2.5 million yuan, which should be approved and allocated by the Ministry of Finance upon the request of the Chamber of Commerce and the local association. The implementation of this loan depends on the advocacy and protection of your ministry. Based on the previous situation in the letter, it is appropriate to submit this request to your ministry for review and approval, and to promptly allocate the funds so that a syndicate can be organized together with the financial industry for periodic implementation, which would be of public benefit. Respectfully submitted. The experience of Outer Tibet is not far away. What the Tusi fear in their hearts, they dare not but report in tears. In addition to submitting copies to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, this is respectfully submitted for your public review. Knocking respectfully, the Mu Li Nine Tribes Tusi and all the monks and people together."</p>

<h3 id="e126">Restaurant Industry Discusses Aviation Donation Yesterday, 5% of Business Volume <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Solicitation Team Headquarters of the Chinese Aviation Association convened the city's restaurant industry at the YMCA in Bāxiānqiáo yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of collecting donations for aviation salvation. Attendees included Cheng Kefan, representative of the Restaurant Industry Association; Zhang Shaoping, Li Mancun, representatives of Xinghualou; Huang Hanliang, Zheng Xingpu, representatives of Guanshengyuan; Lin Jieshou, Su Hesheng, representatives of Fuxingyuan; Ji Fuqing, representative of Taihe Restaurant; Hua Yiqing, representative of Dajiangxiang Restaurant; Ma Lianren, representative of Minghuchun Restaurant; Lin Shou, representative of Xuxingguan; Wang Zicheng, representative of Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant; Zhou Linnan, representative of Meiyuan Restaurant; and dozens of others. The leaders of the headquarters included Mayor Wu (represented by Li Dachao), Li Dachao, Zhang Yuliang, and Chen Shuo; Chairman Wu presided over the meeting, and Chen Shuo served as the recorder. Chairman Wu reported that today, we have invited everyone to discuss the collection of aviation salvation donations from the restaurant industry and exchange opinions. Mayor Wu, the leader of the headquarters, was unable to attend due to other matters and is represented by me. Shanghai is the industrial, commercial, and economic center of the country. If all colleagues are willing to contribute to the aviation salvation movement, the results will be remarkable in the future, and various places will be inspired to respond. This micro-donation campaign is being actively carried out in all aspects to enable the more than 3 million citizens of the city to enthusiastically participate. During the first solicitation campaign, we deeply relied on the support of people from all walks of life in the city, resulting in the recruitment of 100,000 members and more than 1.2 million in aviation salvation donations. Therefore, places like Beijing, Hankou, and roads like Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou have successively worked together. The collection of aviation salvation donations from colleagues in the restaurant industry, such as the hotel industry, fresh meat industry, and fresh pig vendors, has already begun last year, and the results are very good. The donations collected each month have been published in newspapers. The most recent ones that have been carried out and will be collected soon include the cargo trucking industry, rental car industry, and brick and tile transportation industry. Colleagues are strongly supportive of aviation salvation. All of you in the Shanghai restaurant industry have never lagged behind in patriotism, and Shanghai has many restaurants and larger businesses than other places. It is hoped that all attendees will follow the micro-collection measures of the hotel industry, collecting 5% of business volume for aviation salvation donations. I believe that all restaurants will be willing to contribute, and the results will be extremely remarkable in the future. However, in the restaurant industry, there is one more set of utensils, and those who eat and drink should not care about this small amount. Supporting the aviation salvation movement is to save the country and save oneself. Please exchange opinions on the principles first, and then schedule a second meeting to determine the date to start micro-collection, etc. Subsequently, Cheng Kefan, the representative of the Restaurant Industry Association, and Huang Hanliang, Li Mancun, Zhang Shaoping, and Wang Zicheng, representatives of various restaurants, successively spoke, stating that aviation salvation is a current priority and expressing strong support for the micro-collection of aviation salvation donations from the industry. We will certainly do our best to assist in the implementation, etc. Then, the micro-collection measures were discussed, and the meeting was adjourned at 6:30 PM, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e131">China Handles Closing Procedures After Suspension of U.S. Cotton and Wheat Loan, Purchased Cotton Totals More Than 40 Million Yuan <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, yesterday morning, the Huadong News Agency reporter specifically inquired with relevant parties and learned that China's negotiations with the United States for the cotton and wheat loan have been suspended. The reason for the loan was that in 1933, China's cotton and wheat production had sharply decreased, so former Finance Minister Song Ziwen negotiated a U.S. cotton and wheat loan of 50 million U.S. dollars with the U.S. side. After this loan was established, China happened to establish the Cotton Industry Control Association, which greatly increased the domestic production of cotton and wheat, and the demand suddenly decreased. In addition, Japanese yarn factories in China have always purchased cotton from China for their use. When the U.S. cotton loan was established, the Japanese side expressed opposition, and the Japanese yarn factories' purchase of cotton from China was immediately suspended. As a result, China's sales market for U.S. cotton decreased, so it implemented the closure of the purchase of U.S. cotton. Now China has already handled the closing of the purchase of cotton. According to China's conclusion of the U.S. cotton and wheat contract with the United States in 1933, the U.S. cotton and wheat loaned amounted to 17,105,385 yuan, equivalent to more than 40 million Chinese yuan.</p>

<p>Lawyer Hu Fenglian, a member of the Shanghai Bar Association, accepted the entrustment of his client and made a suggestion, requesting the Executive Supervisory Committee of the association to forward a letter to the Shanghai Land Bureau, requesting changes to the transfer registration of land sales and purchases, as well as mortgage registration, etc., to facilitate the process. After the meeting decided to forward the letter to the Municipal Land Bureau, a reply letter was received from Jin Liren, the director of the Land Bureau yesterday, stating that the matter of requesting changes to the measures should be handled in accordance with Article 68 of the Land Law. Upon investigation, the reply letter stated, "Please change the measures for the transfer registration of land sales and purchases and mortgage registration, etc." Upon investigation, the transfer registration measures and real estate mortgage registration rules approved by the city for implementation do not have (agent) regulations. However, Article 68 of the Land Law states that "when registration is applied for by an agent, a letter of authorization should be attached." In the future, when there are agency cases, they can be handled in this way. A corresponding reply is sent for your reference. Respectfully, Jin Liren, Director of the Shanghai Land Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Public Works Bureau Requesting Prompt Dredging of Zoumatang City River <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter, on the 2nd of this month, according to a letter from the Wang Renzhong Baobo of the Gongwan Branch Office of our Chamber, the dredging project of the Zoumatang City River in this district has exceeded the deadline by two months and the dam has not yet been opened, causing difficulties in the transportation of goods, and the accumulated water is stagnant, emitting odors, which is also detrimental to hygiene. Moreover, the spring plowing season is approaching, and irrigation is urgently needed, so opening the dam as soon as possible cannot be delayed. It is rumored that this is because the bridge is being rebuilt and the project has not yet been completed, so there is a saying that the dam will not be opened for a while. If this is true, it is suggested to partially enclose the dam in the area where the bridge reconstruction project is located, and the east and west ends can be opened first to allow ships to pass separately to alleviate the urgency, even if it cannot be passed through in one go, it will also be very convenient, for which a special document is prepared, hoping that the Municipal Public Works Bureau will review and transfer it to open the dam immediately, and transportation and hygiene will all benefit from it, and the farmers will also deeply appreciate it, etc., to the Chamber. Based on this, upon investigation, the Public Works Bureau replied in a letter on October 5, 1933, stating that workers had been dispatched to start work on the 16th of last month. Now, more than two years have passed, and the river project has not yet been completed, causing the dam to be blocked, which is not only causing great difficulties in commercial transportation, but also the weather is getting hotter and the sewage is stagnant, which is detrimental to public health, which is also not insignificant. The branch office advocates to measure the garden dam in the area where the bridge is being rebuilt, and the east and west ends can be opened first, which is to seek convenient transportation in a helpless situation. A corresponding letter is sent to inform you of the situation, hoping that your bureau will review and transfer it to be handled immediately, and also order the river works department to completely dredge and open the dam on a specific day to benefit farmers and merchants, and be deeply grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e134">Rice Riot in Qingpu County <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, a rice boat from Changshu, carrying 202 shi and 5 dou of white rice, arrived in Shanghai, traveling to Sigangkou, Shuangmiao area near Huangdu in the east. More than ten shi of white rice were robbed by the villagers there using small boats. The Shanghai North Rice Transporters' Association was asked to find out the details, and the association submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, which was forwarded to the Municipal Government, requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the competent authorities of Qingpu County to strictly investigate and protect the safety. The original submission is recorded as follows: "Submitting a report on the looting of rice by rioters in Qingpu territory, please immediately transfer it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order an investigation to maintain rice transportation. According to the report of rice merchant Gu Sanbao, a member of the affiliated association, his boat loaded with 202 shi and 5 dou of white rice from Changshu set sail on March 28th. At 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 29th, when it arrived at Six Lane, the Shuangmiao area near Huangdu in the east, which is under the jurisdiction of Qingpu County, it suddenly encountered a small boat from the area, with eight strong men with local accents. They used the　 to drag the rice boat and ordered it to stop. They were immediately　 crowded onto the boat and robbed more than ten shi of white rice by force. At that time, there were as many as seventy or eighty spectators on both sides of the river, but they were not afraid at all, and after plundering, they leisurely sailed away. Afterwards, they immediately looked for　 the township head, and　 reported to the Huangdu District Office. The　 patrol chief came to the boat to investigate the case, and specially entrusted　 to investigate and deal with it. At the same time,　 according to various guests, the villagers there　 were called fierce, and if they were not severely punished,　 all the rice boats would not dare to go to Shanghai, etc., came forward. The act of gang robbery is indeed　 lawless. Various　 rice merchants, because they heard that the people's food security are all hindered　, should report the situation to your bureau and forward it to the Municipal Government, requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the competent authorities of Qingpu County to strictly investigate in order to protect safety and maintain rice transportation, and wait for orders. Presented by Wu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Shanghai Hub North Rice Transport Yongshang Lianyi Association."</p>

<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association of this city, due to the Wusong River dredging and damming by the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission, which has caused inland rice boats heading to Shanghai to detour via Qingpu and Songjiang, encountering robberies, has specially submitted a petition by the association's chairman, Gu Xinyi, to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, earnestly requesting that the police be instructed to conduct strict patrols to protect the rice shipments. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>We have recently learned that the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission is dredging the Yuji Mound section of the Wusong River, and work was completed on the first of April, damming the river. Merchants and shippers from inland areas selling rice in Shanghai are mostly detouring through Qingpu and Songjiang counties, then via the outer Huangpu River to reach Shanghai. At 2:00 AM on the 31st of last month, a boatman named Gu Sanbao, shipping rice from Changshu to Shanghai, detoured through Shuangmiao, which is under the jurisdiction of Qingpu County, and was suddenly robbed by local villagers who gathered in a mob, resulting in a loss of over 30 piculs of white rice. As word of this spreads, rice merchants and boatmen are feeling uneasy. Dredging the Wusong River is not something that can be accomplished overnight. However, during the damming period, customers are refraining from shipping due to the perceived danger of the route, which will inevitably affect the supply to the Shanghai market. Therefore, we are submitting this document to your esteemed office, requesting that you promptly notify the governments of Qingpu and Songjiang counties, instructing their respective water police to conduct strict patrols along the detour routes used by rice boats, to protect the rice shipments and ensure safe transport. We would be immensely grateful.</p>

<p>The first group wedding ceremony organized by the Municipal Government as part of the New Life Movement was held at 3:00 PM yesterday in the City Hall auditorium. The wedding participants, officiant, witnesses, all city hall staff, and spectators inside and outside the hall numbered over ten thousand. Amidst the lively atmosphere, there was also a solemn air. The ceremony lasted one hour and fifteen minutes. A Central News Agency reporter has provided the following details:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Wedding Hall</p>
<p>The Party and national flags fluttered in front of the City Hall gate. The Party emblem and Party and national flags were fastened on the second-floor railings, creating a brand-new atmosphere. Flowers were arranged along the steps. In the center of the hall, a space was left, covered with a large red carpet leading directly to the stage. Numbers were placed side by side, and colored ribbons were arranged on both sides to create a standing area for the newlyweds awaiting the ceremony. Next to it was the officiant's seat. A pair of large candlesticks, each two feet tall, was placed in front of the stage, engraved with "May the offspring be numerous" and "Dragon and Phoenix bring prosperity." The stage was also fully covered with a red carpet. Flowers were displayed by the staircase. A portrait of Sun Yat-sen was placed on a table in front, with three pairs of red-covered chairs placed to the left and right. Two side tables were placed at the edge of the stage, holding certificates and souvenirs. Chairs were arranged on all four sides of the stage for the audience.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Spectators</p>
<p>The brides and grooms, accompanied by their parents, arrived one after another, first going to the dining hall on the ground floor of the City Hall to sit down according to their assigned numbers and get ready. Guests from all walks of life gathered around the City Hall, in great numbers. The Public Security Bureau dispatched police to maintain order strictly. Those with tickets scrambled to get in, creating an unprecedented lively scene. All city hall staff members worked diligently in the hall to take care of everyone, especially Mayor Wu, who directed the arrangements, adding to the excitement. Celebrities such as Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaoxu also attended the ceremony with their families.</p>
<p>Gracious Reception</p>
<p>The officiant was Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and the witness was Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau. The master of ceremonies was Wang Xianqing. Sun Binghui, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, led the grooms, and Ms. Chen Guowei led the brides. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Cai Jinjun, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Li Dachao, Section Chief of the Municipal Government, and Secretaries Zhang Tingrong and Tang Shixuan, and Wu Huanru, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, all wore blue robes and black mandarin jackets and provided guidance and reception on the spot. Because it was the first group wedding, all the arrangements took a lot of time, especially the brides getting ready, who arrived late, so the ceremony did not begin until 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Newlyweds Enter</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau sent four male and female staff members, holding gauze lanterns, to guide the brides and grooms separately from the rest area. When they entered the hall from the main staircase of the City Hall, the City Music Corps played music outside the hall. After entering, Ms. Zhang Tingrong's daughter, Lianqing, and four students from the National Conservatory of Music played the piano and violin, and the hall, which was initially noisy, suddenly became quiet, adding to the solemnity and grandeur of the wedding. The brides wore white dresses and veils, with badges and corsages on their chests, and held bouquets of flowers tied with pink ribbons. The grooms wore blue robes and black mandarin jackets, and each couple looked full of vitality.</p>
<p>Conducting the Ceremony</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony began, and to save time, it was changed to have two couples perform the ceremony at the same time. The master of ceremonies announced the names of both parties. The groom was led by Sun Binghui, and the bride was led by Chen Guowei. They ascended the stage from the side staircase, stood in front of Sun Yat-sen's portrait, and the master of ceremonies called out to pay the highest respect to the portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the Party and national flags, bowing three times. The bride and groom stood facing each other and bowed twice, returned to their positions, and bowed once to the officiant. Mayor Wu, who was standing to the left, presented the certificate to the groom, and Director Wu, who was on the right, presented the commemorative badge to the bride. They bowed once to thank the officiant, and the couple retreated hand in hand, standing in the designated position.</p>
<p>Reading the Testimony</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Mayor Wu read the testimony: "On the third day of April in the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Municipal Government held the first New Life Group Wedding Ceremony. Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, are the witnesses." He officially announced that so-and-so (list of 57 couples) and other participants were legally married. Then he read the instructions (see yesterday's newspaper, details omitted here). The ceremony ended at 4:15 PM, and Ms. Zhang Lianqing played the piano as the brides and grooms exited the hall. Finally, at the open space, Wang Kai Photo Studio took a group photo.</p>
<p>Rivaling Film Shoots</p>
<p>The ceremony ended as dusk fell, but the crowd gathered in the square in front of the City Hall remained packed. The City Public Security Bureau Band played music again. The doors of the hall were wide open. The 57 pairs of brides and grooms followed the male and female staff of the City Hall, who carried bright horn lanterns and palace lanterns, and filed out in formation. As they slowly walked up the stone steps, the blue robes and black mandarin jackets contrasted with the white wedding dresses. From a distance, it looked like a floral pattern with oriental flavor, which can be called a spectacle. The Film Division of the Central Propaganda Department, as well as Paramount, MGM, Fox, and other film companies from the United States, sent photographers to the scene to compete in shooting newsreels. They will each send the films to major cities around the world using the fastest means of transmission. In one month, this world-rare group wedding ceremony will be seen by people in various countries. The brides and grooms stood in a semi-circular formation in front of the City Hall's noble steps for half an hour, allowing news reporters and photographers to take pictures. The Mayor and the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau also stood smiling in the center of this rosy formation. They dispersed around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Feasting with Relatives and Friends</p>
<p>Statistics show that the wedding ceremony lasted a total of one hour and fifteen minutes, which can be said to be extremely simple, but the solemn scene was unmatched by traditional weddings. Mayor Wu and Director Wu originally planned to provide refreshments for the newlyweds but changed the funds for this item to be used for commemorative gifts to pursue permanence and save time, so it was cancelled. For a time, the vehicles on the central district and Jiangwan Road were connected, and the crowds were packed, creating a joyful situation that had never been seen before. It is said that the newlyweds all feasted with relatives and friends last night to celebrate.</p>

<h3 id="e141">World Cruise: German Liner Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; After Sightseeing, Passengers Board Ship Tonight for Northbound Journey <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the German Hapag-Lloyd's world cruise liner, the "Lissauer," carrying 297 tourists and over 100 crew members, departed from New York on January 12 for a world cruise. After more than two months, it arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning around 2:00 AM. The Hapag-Lloyd branch office on the Bund specially sent a small launch in advance to meet and guide the ship outside Wusongkou, as the liner was visiting Shanghai for the first time and was not very familiar with the Huangpu River route. When it docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou, the passengers were still asleep, so they did not disembark at that time. They all went ashore after breakfast around 8:00 AM.</p>
<p>Touring the Entirety of Shanghai</p>
<p>The 200-plus tourists disembarked at 8:30 AM after breakfast. The company had pre-rented over 200 cars to carry the tourists from the pier to the French Concession and Longhua. Then, via the Fawangdu Garden in West Shanghai, Nanjing Road, and Henan Road, they went to Zhabei Jiangwan to inspect the January 28th Battle Zone. Finally, they went via North Sichuan Road to the Astor House Hotel on the Waibaidu Bridge to rest and have lunch. In the afternoon, around 2:00 PM, the tourists re-embarked, taking over 300 rickshaws to visit the Nanshi and City God Temple, visiting bird markets, teahouses, etc., as these social situations were all unseen by these tourists. They finished their tour around 6:00 PM and had dinner on the ship. Around 8:00 PM, a tea dance was held at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, but not all the tourists participated, as some of them felt tired from touring all day.</p>
<p>Magnificent Facilities</p>
<p>The "Lissauer" liner is the second largest liner of the German Hapag-Lloyd Company. It is an all-white gasoline-powered liner, weighing 20,000 tons, 620 feet long, 72 feet wide, and nine stories high. It can travel 42 miles per hour. The facilities inside the ship are extremely perfect, such as swimming pools, billiard rooms, smoking rooms, libraries, dance halls, etc., all fully equipped. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, the pier was temporarily filled with various vendors, creating a lively and bustling scene.</p>
<p>Prince's Conversation</p>
<p>Among the tourists who came yesterday were Prince Rudolph of Hohenzollern-Kinzigburg of Germany, Princess Anna, Prince Adolf of Buschhorn-Liepsbon, and Princess Elizabeth. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited yesterday and first met Princess Elizabeth. The princess spoke fluent English. Later, Elizabeth introduced Prince Adolf and others for a joint interview. They praised China very much, calling China an exotic land. This was their first visit to China, but before coming to Shanghai, they had long heard of China's culture, history, etc., which were not matched by European and Western countries. They regretted that they could not stay in Shanghai and other parts of China for longer on this trip. If there is an opportunity in the future, they plan to come to China again for a longer stay. They then said that they would leave Shanghai tomorrow morning (that is, this morning) and head north to Qinhuangdao, transferring to Peiping (Beijing) for sightseeing. They believed that Peiping, as the ancient capital of China, would surely make them feel even more novel.</p>
<p>Departure for Peiping This Morning</p>
<p>After returning to the ship last night, the tourists were allowed to depart at 8:00 AM this morning, leaving Shanghai and heading north to Qinhuangdao, then transferring to the Beining Railway to visit Peiping. They are scheduled to visit Peiping for three days, then take the original ship from Qinhuangdao to Japan, then through Honolulu and the Panama Canal, and return to the United States, scheduled to return to New York on May 26.</p>

<p>At around 0:30 AM yesterday, Xiangtai Iron Shop, located at 322-326 North Suzhou Road, was suddenly attacked with a bomb, which exploded on the spot with a loud bang, shaking the neighborhood.

<p>At around 7:00 PM the night before last, a thug suddenly appeared at the home of Yang Wenxiang, a barber from Yangzhou, on Haichang Road (near Yaojia Right Bridge) in Zhabei. Yang was not at home at the time. When the thug saw the Yang family, he took out a Mauser pistol and started firing wildly. As a result, Yang's wife, Ji (43 years old), was shot in the chest, with the bullet passing through the front and back. She was shot in the right shoulder, with the bullet passing through the neck and exiting from the left shoulder. Yang Wenxiang's eldest daughter, Yang Kouzi (17 years old), was shot twice in the center of her chest, with the bullets passing through her back. The second daughter, Kou Dizi (15 years old), saw that her mother and sister had been killed and hid under the bed, but she was also shot twice by the thug, once in the left waist and once in the center of her left hand. Seeing that all three had been shot and killed, the thug lay down at the doorway, with his head on the threshold and his feet facing outward, and pointed the Mauser pistol at the center of his forehead and pulled the trigger to commit suicide. The bullet exited from the back of his head. After the incident, neighbors arrived and found that Kou Dizi had not yet died, so they immediately sent her to Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road for treatment. They also rushed to report to the Xinzha Branch Bureau. Director Ruan Kai sent Inspector Jiang Dianle to investigate and confirm the facts. A Mauser pistol and three bullet casings were found next to the thug's body and taken to the bureau. The report was submitted to the Inspection Department of the Public Security Bureau, which ordered the 11th District security guard to report to the Shanghai Local Court to request an autopsy. At around 4:00 PM yesterday, Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, accompanied by Secretary Chen Rong, arrived at the scene. The autopsy confirmed that Yang Ji, Yang Kouzi, and the suicide thug, Sun Jingyu, had died from gunshot wounds sustained while alive. The death certificates were filled out. The bodies of Yang Ji and Yang Kouzi, mother and daughter, were placed in coffins by Yang Wenxiang himself. The body of the thug had not yet been placed in a coffin as of evening.</p>

<p>Zhu Jihuang, Chinese Detective Sergeant of the Hongkou Police, along with Detectives Wang Runhe and Fang Fucheng, learned that someone was secretly selling opium at 710 and 646 Renzhi Lane on North Sichuan Road to make a profit. They reported this to the head of the police and obtained a search warrant from the First Special District Court.

The accomplices, Xu (from Guangdong), and customers Liang Yongfa, Cen Yuesan, Gu Jimin, and suspect Shi Yiren, were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court. Li Zhishan, lawyer of the Public Works Department, detailed the previous situation and requested an investigation. Then, Chinese and Western detectives explained the process of solving the case and presented the evidence for inspection. Judge Wu Zehan questioned the defendants clearly and sentenced Xu Mo to one year and two months of imprisonment, with a fine of 120 yuan. The three defendants, Liang, Cen, and Gu, were each fined 30 yuan. The items were confiscated as listed. Shi Yiren was found not guilty. Lawyer Li waived the appeal, and he was released in court.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Pitiable Situation of a Woman: Loss of Job Leading to Abortion; Inserts a Strip of Pickled Radish to Induce Abortion; Although the Fetus Was Disturbed, It Was Still Removed by the Hospital — Sentenced to Two Years, Probation Granted <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Shen Chen, a young woman from Zhenjiang, 39 years old, came to Shanghai due to extreme poverty. Through a recommendation, she was hired as a domestic worker at the home of a Japanese man named Mr. So-and-so at 9 Pingliang Road, Yangshupu. However, she was already pregnant. Fearing that her abdomen would gradually swell, making it inconvenient to work, and causing her employer to dislike her, leading to job loss, she went to the Guangren Hospital on February 6, begging for an abortion. The hospital gently advised against it, stating that abortion without cause is not only unethical but also a cruel act. Although she accepted the advice at the time, she recently had a relapse after privately calculating that she was three months pregnant. She knew that Japanese women were fond of pickled radishes, but they would avoid eating them when pregnant. From this, she deduced that radishes must be harmful to pregnant women. On the evening of the 20th of last month, she asked her employer for leave, claiming that she was going to a wedding feast at a relative's house in Zhabei, and did not return until the next morning. Her employer saw that she looked haggard and asked her about it, but she hesitated and could not answer. Her employer thought she was sick and told her to go to the hospital for treatment. She also felt unbearable pain and went to the Guangren Hospital again for treatment, explaining the cause of her illness. It turned out that on the evening of the 20th, she did not actually go to a banquet but secretly took a strip of pickled radish from her employer's house and inserted it into her vagina in a secluded place, thinking that the fetus would be aborted. However, after one night, although the fetus was disturbed, it did not come out. It formed a state of being neither in nor out. The doctor then performed surgery to remove the fetus and kept her in the hospital for treatment. The hospital reported this to the local police station. Yesterday morning, the police station sent detectives and learned that she had recovered. They took her to the First Special District Local Court. Jiang Baolian, the lawyer representing the police station, filed a public lawsuit against her based on Article 304, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law regarding abortion. He stated the details of the case, presented the hospital's diagnosis certificate, and the strip of pickled radish she used for the abortion as evidence. When questioned, Shen Chen confessed to using a pickled radish to induce an abortion, stating that she came up with the method herself and was not taught by anyone. She did this because she feared losing her job if she was pregnant. After the interrogation, Judge Zhan sentenced her to two years of imprisonment. Considering that the motive for the abortion was purely a matter of livelihood and the circumstances were excusable, he leniently granted her two years of probation.</p>
<h3 id="e147">China's Egg Industry and Hygiene – As Reported by the North-China Daily News' London Correspondent <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The London correspondent of the North-China Daily News reported on March 29th: I (the correspondent) recently learned about the matter of Chinese liquid eggs being imported into England. Those in China are certainly unaware, which some readers may be interested to hear. This week, someone made unfavorable comments about Chinese eggs. A newspaper even published a report written by a mycologist after examining samples, claiming that they contained excessive mold and could not be considered a satisfactory product. This criticism undoubtedly stems from the pressure of the British Poultry Association. A major importer of Chinese liquid eggs told me in response that China is the main country exporting liquid eggs, something I had never imagined. In 1927, England imported a total of 640,000 CWT (hundredweight, 112 pounds) of liquid eggs, of which 625,500 CWT came from China. Last year, the import figure was 818,370 CWT, with China accounting for 800,765 CWT. However, this actually exceeds the average figure, as British importers, hearing rumors that the government would increase import taxes, made bold and special purchases. Apart from China, Egypt is the next largest exporter of liquid eggs to England, with about 20,000 CWT. The total from other countries is only a few thousand. The merchant who spoke to me said that the vast number of bakeries in England rely on Chinese liquid eggs as their raw material. This industry was unknown thirty years ago and was created by companies such as Lyons and ABC. Therefore, the Chinese liquid egg industry not only provides British shipping companies with approximately £180,000 in freight charges each year, and insurance companies and warehouses with approximately £90,000 in increased income, but also supports the livelihoods of thousands of cooks and bakers, and boosts sales of sugar, flour, raisins, and other industries. If the import of this type of egg product were banned, the enormous losses on all sides would be conceivable. The merchant also showed me photos of Shanghai and Qingdao egg factories at work. The female workers all wear white hats and aprons, presenting a very fresh image. He also mentioned the mycologist's report, saying that the standards mentioned in the report far exceed what England requires. He then asked me, have there been any epidemics caused by eating cakes made with Chinese eggs in England over the years? In fact, there have never been any. Translator's note: China's export industry relies entirely on a few native products. In recent years, silk and tea have plummeted, and other products are also being gradually diminished. Yet, even this small egg product cannot be tolerated and is arbitrarily criticized in the hope of completely eliminating it. Will those of our countrymen who like to use imported goods be moved by reading this account?</p>

Mr. Li, head of the Jiangwan China Farm in this city, Mr. Da, also head of the Yishi Garden Farm, and Mr. Hu Zongzhao, an enthusiastic advocate of rural revival, initiated the Shanghai Exhibition of Rural Revival Products, which has been filed with the Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs.

<h3 id="e149">Failure to Revive the China-England Dispensary; New Company to be Formed by Depositors; Old Company to be Liquidated and Dissolved <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>China-England Dispensary Co., Ltd. on Nanjing Road, along with its various branches, was previously unable to manage its finances. The shareholders resolved to entrust accountant Xie Lin to declare liquidation. Mr. Xie then convened a meeting of creditors to discuss the matter. It was decided to appoint representatives to explore the possibility of revival. However, the representatives consulted several times, and the depositors' opinions could not be reconciled. The shareholders also had no intention of continuing the business. Yesterday, it was finally decided to liquidate the company according to the law. After the liquidation is completed, the new company will take over, and the old company will be dissolved. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Creditors' Opinions: The dispensary owes over 161,000 yuan in sales payments and over 179,000 yuan to banks and money shops. Previously, Mr. Xie convened a meeting at the Daya Lou restaurant. The creditors present, seeing that the Jicheng Dispensary had resumed business after closing, mostly advocated that the China-England Dispensary should also find a way to revive. They appointed Meng Xian, Shao Jingfu, and ten others as representatives to carry out the revival based on the results of the creditors' meeting. They consulted several times at Mr. Xie's office and audited the accounts. However, there were many obstacles to the revival, making it difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Decision to Dissolve: The dispensary owes depositors a massive 783,000 yuan, accounting for more than half of the total claims. If the revival were to proceed, the depositors' opinions would have to be sought. The depositors were concerned that the proposed revival method would involve paying off the deposits over ten years, which they considered too long and uncertain. They did not agree, hindering the progress of the revival. At the same time, the shareholders felt that the domestic economic downturn was worsening and that it would not be easy to turn the business around in the short term. If they decided to revive, they would need to increase capital, but many shareholders were in financial difficulties. They had no confidence in raising funds under the current market conditions and expressed their opposition to the revival.</p>
<p>Formation of a New Company: As a result of the negotiations with the shareholders, it was decided to liquidate the company and entrust Mr. Xie Lin's firm with the liquidation procedures starting on [date missing]. The company will be handed over to a new company, and the original company will be dissolved. Currently, a group of depositors is advocating taking over the dispensary with their deposits and forming a new company. It is said that most depositors have expressed their agreement and are now in the process of organizing the new company. The takeover is expected to happen soon. As for the name, since China-England has a history of over fifty years, the original name of China-England Dispensary will generally be retained, with a distinguishing mark added to differentiate it.</p>

<p>The two railway administrations received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating: Regarding the issue of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway joining the domestic joint transportation of goods, and the restrictions on shipping goods across the river in the capital, which makes it inconvenient to handle joint transportation with fifteen-ton freight cars, the Ministry previously stipulated that if two fifteen-ton freight cars were unloaded at the same destination station, they could be jointly transported, considering the joint transportation of goods on the railway and the convenience of merchants. When combining the goods from two cars into one for joint transportation, two points must be noted and followed. Now, to maintain the joint transportation of goods on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and to facilitate merchants, three additional measures are hereby stipulated as follows: The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Administration shall transport the three items of tea leaves, paper goods, and matchbox slices in full carloads that are loaded daily, and if there are two full carloads of fifteen tons arriving at [missing], the Zhakou Station should combine them with some ten-ton full carloads for joint transportation. However, the volume of each fifteen-ton car shall not exceed 22.5 cubic meters. The freight charges will still be collected separately according to the full carload freight rates for each type of goods. The combined goods must arrive at the same destination [missing]. However, if there are not two full carloads [missing] to the destination [missing], then they can be transported to [missing] on the same route [missing]. If there are no two fifteen-ton cars [missing] to the station on the same day [missing], [missing] should [missing] instead.</p>
<p>If there are still no [missing] goods on the [missing] day, [missing] within [missing] days and [missing]. In addition to [missing], the order is hereby issued [missing].</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, to ensure safety, has adopted the recommendations of the Police and Traffic Committee and revised several points in the existing regulations on freight trucks and trailer licenses. One is to prohibit passengers, whether taking a ride or a chartered trip, from receiving any remuneration. This prohibition does not apply to group passenger vehicles that have separate licenses. In addition, there is often a risk of goods falling from flatbed trucks during transit. It is also inconvenient to install guardrails on the sides of these trucks. It has now been decided that all such flatbed trucks must have wooden strips nailed to both sides to make the edges slightly higher, so that the loaded items are slightly tilted inward to ensure safety. In addition to the driver, only one other person is allowed to ride in the front of the freight truck, and the driver's seat must be partitioned. These regulations are now being prepared for implementation.</p>

<p>The Traffic Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently stated that although parking of cars on Hankou Road, Jiujiang Road, [missing], Ningbo Road, and other locations in the central district may be permitted by regulations or allowed by custom, the increasing length of new vehicles makes parking and leaving very troublesome, which greatly hinders traffic. It has now been proposed to the Board of Directors to revise Clause 47 of the traffic regulations as follows: 1. On Hankou Road, the section between Jiangxi Road and Henan Road will only allow parallel parking (Ranking) along the roadside on the north side in the future, and will not allow perpendicular parking (Parking). 2. On Jiujiang Road, from the Bund to Henan Road, only parallel parking of cars on the south side will be allowed in the future. 3. On Fuzhou Road, the section between Jiangxi Road and Henan Road will only allow parallel parking of cars on the north side during office hours in the future. 4. On Ningbo Road, the section between Jiangxi Road and Henan Road will only allow parallel parking on the north side in the morning and on the south side in the afternoon in the future. The section between Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road will be subject to the same regulations as before.</p>

<p>The six counties of Huzhou are the wealthiest areas in western Zhejiang, with abundant products, especially silk and brocade, which are particularly prominent. They have a long history and a considerable reputation in domestic and foreign markets. Since this year, under the pressure of foreign goods and artificial silk, and the influence of the decline of commerce in Inner Mongolia, sales have declined daily. It is now heard that the Huzhou Society in this city, to revitalize local products, plans to use the empty space on the four walls of the society to display samples of local products from the six counties of Huzhou for exhibition, in order to arouse the deep understanding of outsiders and gradually promote them. This measure will be of great benefit to the local products of Huzhou. Ling Jun Songru, the director of the society's affairs department, has prepared measures for collecting and displaying samples of local products and photos of scenic spots and historical sites in Huzhou, which have been discussed and passed by the society's committee and handed over to the society's industrial and affairs departments for implementation. Various forms have now been made and sent to the agencies and organizations in the six counties, requesting them to widely collect the items.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Huashang Public Bus Company is striving to develop traffic in the northern district. It is now heard that the company plans to have the Route One public buses detour through Xixing Road, Liuying Road, and Shuidian Road for traffic facilities, and has submitted a request to the Public Utilities Bureau for approval. It is expected that the route will be opened soon. Here is an excerpt of the submission: The company's main Route One originally ran from the North Station via [missing]shan Road, Tongji Road, Jiangwan Road, and West Sports Association Road to the end of Xinshi Road. It has recently been found that Xixing Road has been widened and has an increasing number of shops and residents. In addition, Shuidian Road has the establishment of the Chizhi College and Guangdong East Middle School, and it seems necessary to operate public buses there. It has also been observed that the section of [missing]shan Road, Tongji Road, Jiangwan Road, and West Sports Association Road is currently served by the company's Routes One, Four, and Five, which seems too dense. To achieve traffic adjustment, it is proposed to have Route One, starting from the North Station, change its route to run along [missing]shan Road, Xixing Road, Liuying Road, and Shuidian Road, and then along West Sports Association Road to the end of Xinshi Road. A proposed fare station table is included. The company respectfully submits this document for your consideration and approval.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Wang Wenkui Accused of Forcing a Young Woman to Have an Abortion, Resulting in Her Tragic Death; She Was Already Pregnant When They Began Cohabitating, and He Feared Confusion of Lineage, So He Poisoned Her; The Elderly Couple, Distraught Over Their Daughter's Tragic Death, Filed a Private Prosecution <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Wang Wenkui, also known as Wang Cheng, a native of Ningbo who runs a reed organ factory at No. 12, Tailai Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, has recently been sued by Ling Songsun (63 years old this year), an elderly man from Suzhou residing on Dajing Road, who has engaged lawyer Gu Jicheng as his agent. The lawsuit was filed with the Criminal Division of the Special District Court, accusing Wang of the crimes of abandonment and injury resulting in death, under Articles 307, Section 2, and 296, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff's statement alleges that the defendant forced an abortion without consent, resulting in serious injury and death, and requests that justice be served and severe punishment be imposed. The plaintiff's family was poor, and their daughter, Xingbao, was introduced to work as a servant in the Wenlan Pavilion brothel on Fuzhou Road at the age of eighteen in 1932. The defendant frequented the establishment and, seeing the beauty of the young woman, seduced her. The young woman, naive and inexperienced, was unable to resist and was lured into the plot. From around June of the same year, Wang repeatedly took her to rooms in the Central Hotel and the Great Shanghai Hotel for cohabitation, despite her parents' dissuasion. Finally, they moved to the front廂房 on the upper floor of No. 3, Lane 2, Handeli, Gulangyu Road, near Nicheng Bridge. On the twentieth day of the seventh lunar month of the same year, the defendant sent someone to inform them that Xingbao was in critical condition after an abortion and asked them to come and see her. When the couple arrived, they found their daughter had died, her eyes staring straight ahead, her lower body covered in bloody filth, and a piece of flesh about two inches long placed on a piece of paper. The couple was heartbroken at the sight and cried out in anguish. The defendant, feeling guilty and fearing exposure, knelt and begged them not to make a scene, promising to support the two elderly for the rest of their lives. After the funeral, the defendant's younger sister, Laoqi (also known as Aunt Qi and Nanny Lingling), also interceded to prevent the matter from escalating. The couple, out of consideration, endured it for a time. Lao Laotai witnessed the scene. Later, the defendant transported the coffin to the Ningbo Guild Hall on Xieqiao, registered it under the name of Wang Cheng, and left it there. When the plaintiff's daughter was cohabiting with the defendant, she was already pregnant. The defendant, fearing that the offspring would confuse the lineage, resorted to this cruel method, treating abortion like child's play and regarding human life as worthless. His viciousness and cruelty surpassed even the most inhumane beasts. The plaintiff's loss of a daughter is a small matter, but humanity is a great matter. If justice is not served, the soul of the deceased will forever be in unrest. Therefore, the lawsuit is filed according to law, requesting that the defendant be arrested and brought to justice, and including a civil suit, requesting that he be ordered to pay damages of 15,000 yuan to punish the lawbreakers and comfort the lonely soul. The court, based on the statement, convened a hearing by Judge Li Changnian the day before yesterday. The defendant did not arrive after being summoned. The plaintiff, represented by a lawyer, stated that they were ill and requested a postponement. The court, after reviewing the report, granted the request and adjourned the hearing to be rescheduled later.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Shanghai-Taiwan Ferry; Collision Between the Maoli and Haiguang Vessels; Accident Occurred in Haimen Port; Maoli Suspended from Service Starting Today <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Maoli vessel of the Maoli Shipping Company in this city collided with an Asia Oil Transport vessel in Haimen on its previous trip from Shanghai to Haimen and back to Shanghai yesterday. Both vessels were damaged. The Maoli has been suspended from service for repairs. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Truth About the Collision</p>
<p>The Maoli vessel of the Maoli Shipping Company sailed from Shanghai to Haimen and Huangyan last Thursday, fully loaded with cargo and passengers. It first arrived at Zhoushan and then sailed to Haimen. At 4:05 AM on March 30th, when it reached the entrance to Haimen Port, the Haiguang, a kerosene tanker of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, was also transporting goods to Haimen for unloading. It had arrived in the port on the 29th and was anchored in the center of the river. The Maoli vessel arrived at Haimen River. Last night, it was during high tide and extremely dark. According to regulations, the fore and aft masthead lights on the Haiguang should have been arranged with the front light higher and the rear light lower. However, on that vessel, the rear light was higher and the front masthead light was lower. As the Maoli vessel was being pushed by the high tide, the captain ordered a turn to dock at the wharf. Unfortunately, during the turn, the Maoli vessel was pushed by the tide and collided with the Haiguang. Both vessels were damaged as a result.</p>
<p>Extent of the Damage</p>
<p>The Haiguang oil tanker was originally anchored in Haimen Port. When the Maoli vessel turned, the collision occurred. According to Captain Xu, the Maoli vessel was fully loaded with cargo and passengers and was heavily affected by the tide. It was impossible to stop the vessel during the turn, resulting in the unfortunate collision. At the time, the Maoli believed that it had collided with the stern of the Haiguang. Unexpectedly, the height of the masthead lights was reversed, and the collision occurred on the left side of the Haiguang's bow. The damage was not very significant. On the Maoli vessel itself, the middle of the right outer hull was dented due to the impact with the Haiguang's bow. The black edge was cut into two sections, but there was no rupture. According to Captain Xu's inspection after the incident, the Haiguang's losses were approximately 300-400 yuan, while the Maoli's hull damage was only around 700-800 yuan.</p>
<p>Repairs in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the accident, the captain of the Maoli vessel and the captain of the Haiguang vessel certified the collision and assessed the damage on the spot. The Maoli then docked to unload cargo and passengers before continuing to Huangyan. It then returned from Haimen to Shanghai. Yesterday, Captain Xu reported the collision to the company and the company forwarded the report to the Maritime Affairs Bureau and sent a letter to the Insurance Association, requesting that personnel be sent to inspect the damage to the vessel. The Maoli Company, to ensure safe navigation, has decided to suspend the Maoli from service starting today and enter the shipyard for repairs. The collision between the Maoli vessel and the Haiguang will result in losses of approximately 3,000 yuan, including the loss of scheduled voyages. The cargo and passengers are all safe.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Market Situation Amidst Restrictions on Foreign Rice <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>In order to maintain domestic agricultural production, the government has newly formulated measures to restrict foreign rice, and the Central Bank has raised funds to establish a Food Transportation and Sales Bureau. This has been reported in previous newspapers. According to a conversation with a leader in the rice industry, it is recently rumored that the No. 3 foreign rice, which will be subject to a slightly increased import tax, that is, rice with more than 60 broken grains per hundred grains, is sold for about one yuan cheaper than No. 1 rice because the import tax is reduced by half. Poor people are eager to buy and eat it because of its low price. In fact, the price of the rice merchants ordering from Saigon and other places is no lower than that of No. 1 rice. In total, it is estimated that about 4 million bags of No. 1 and No. 3 foreign rice have been ordered this year, and more than 3 million bags have been shipped one after another, with only about 900,000 bags remaining. Among them, No. 3 rice accounts for less than 100,000 bags. It is expected that it can be sold out in an instant when it is imported. However, since hearing the news of the tax increase, the colleagues have not dared to continue ordering, so the effect of restriction has been achieved invisibly, and the source can be greatly reduced. As for the number already purchased, it is not too much to supply the needs of the people of our country. Moreover, the climate has been extremely cold recently, and the spring harvest has been greatly affected, and the price of rice has tended to rise step by step. If it comes to the time when the old grain is exhausted and the new grain has not yet arrived, it will definitely be even higher, and it is necessary to pre-plan methods of prevention and rescue. Therefore, the existing foreign rice will not hinder domestic agricultural production.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Siamese Government Orders Compulsory Classes in Chinese Schools to Stop; Lin Tianduo Sends Letter to Siamese Ministry of Education Presenting New Ideas; Siamese Authorities Seem to Want to Find New Approaches <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>(Hua Lian News Agency, Bangkok) More than ten years ago, the Siamese government designated certain areas to implement compulsory education. Overseas Chinese in Siam also followed suit and stipulated certain areas as compulsory education zones. All children aged seven to fourteen were required to attend classes in compulsory schools. There has been no difference in the management since its establishment. Unexpectedly, on January 19th of this year, the Siamese Ministry of Education, citing the implementation of the constitutional ten-year education plan, notified all Chinese schools to uniformly stop compulsory classes from April 1st. Upon receiving this sudden notice, and learning that it was aimed specifically at Chinese schools, the Chinese schools wrote letters to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Education of Siam, requesting that they withdraw the order and allow the compulsory classes in Chinese schools to continue as before. It is recently heard that the Siamese Minister of Education seems to want to find another solution to the suspension of compulsory classes in Chinese schools. In early February, the Siamese Ministry of Education invited Lin Tianduo, the principal of Shantou Jiaoguang Middle School, to a meal to listen to his opinions. Later, Lin sent a letter to the Siamese Minister of Education at the end of February, offering a new method for continuing the compulsory classes in Chinese schools, in which he stated that the trial method would be of great benefit to Siam. His new method is as follows: (1) The proposed method is to enable Chinese schools to run education for education's sake, to assist the Siamese government, and there is no other purpose in it.</p>
<p>(2) The proposed method is to enable Chinese schools to not conflict with Siamese laws and government administration. Therefore, all Chinese schools within Siam that can abide by the national regulations and be incorporated into the correct track of rule, and can seriously run schools and assist the country in cultivating talents and seeking happiness for society, even if they are privately established, they will still be allowed to continue running.</p>
<p>(3) The new method is to exempt both the government and Chinese schools from economic losses. Because the compulsory classes in Siamese Chinese schools are closed, not only will more than one hundred Chinese schools immediately go bankrupt and thousands of teachers and staff will lose their jobs, but the government will increase the burden of more than 500,000 yuan of education funds every year, which will have a great adverse impact on the current financial situation of the Siamese country. Therefore, the compulsory classes in Chinese schools should still be maintained.</p>
<p>(4) The new method can win the obedience of overseas Chinese and the sympathy of the masses. Mutual The method is to enhance the cultural harmony and feelings between China and Siam.</p>
<p>(6) The proposed method is directly related to the occupation of overseas Chinese and indirectly related to the economy of the Siamese country. Therefore, its purpose is to meet the requirements of Siamese society and the country, to cultivate useful talents for overseas Chinese in Siam. For example, overseas Chinese in Siam mostly engage in industry and commerce and hold the center of the country's economy. However, in today's business world, it is impossible to apply if they do not know the Siamese Chinese English language. Therefore, this new method is to provide overseas Chinese with appropriate education, which is also beneficial to the development of overseas Chinese careers, and also has a good impact on the source of the Siamese national economy.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Ministry of Education Instructions to Two Universities: Transportation and Business Colleges - Order to National Chiao Tung University <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>(Nanking, 3rd) Based on the previous inspection report, the Ministry of Education issued an order to National Chiao Tung University on the 3rd, stating that the university's facilities are generally in order, the equipment is of a considerable scale, the faculty are dedicated to teaching, and the students are diligent and hardworking. The usual assessment of performance is quite strict, absenteeism is rare, the admission of new students is strictly managed, and both discipline and management are well regulated and earnestly implemented, which has created a good academic atmosphere. This is commendable and gratifying. However, the following points still need to be observed and improved to achieve perfection: 1. The organization and names of the university's colleges are mostly inconsistent with current education laws and regulations. According to Article 4 of the University Organization Law and Article 6 of the University Regulations, the College of Science should be renamed the College of Science, the College of Management should be renamed the College of Business, and the original departments should remain. The three colleges of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering should be merged into the College of Engineering, with the three departments of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. Under the departments, groups may be established with the original names of (Sections) or (Divisions), which should be changed to (Departments) or (Groups) to comply with regulations. 2. The university's graduate school should follow the "Provisional Organization Regulations for University Graduate Schools" approved by the Ministry and promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and submit a detailed plan for approval by the Ministry. 3. The university has too many faculty members. Except for military training instructors, the names should be changed according to Article 13 of the University Organization Law. The number of lecturers and teaching assistants should be appropriately reduced, and a dedicated professor system should be strictly implemented. 4. The number of university staff, service personnel, and security guards is excessively large and should be reduced. Special expenses should be tightened to use the savings to supplement equipment. 5. Many lower-level courses in the university are taught purely in English, which may hinder the progress of students' studies. The weekly teaching hours in each college are more than 30 hours, leaving little opportunity for extracurricular study. These issues must be corrected. 6. The university's upper campus and library are old and decaying and may collapse at any time. Efforts should be made to rebuild them. The equipment in the colleges of engineering should be strengthened to facilitate teaching. You are hereby ordered to comply and report.</p>
<p>Order to National Shanghai College of Commerce</p>
<p>The order to National Shanghai College of Commerce roughly stated that most of the faculty members of the college are dedicated to their duties and are diligent. Disciplinary management and various examinations can be implemented seriously. The students are simple and diligent, abide by the school rules, and the absence of absenteeism is decreasing. The academic atmosphere has gradually become better, which is commendable and gratifying. However, the following points still need to be observed and improved: (1) In addition to handling other cases for the college's construction of school buildings, completion should be sought as soon as possible. (2) The college's office expenses account for more than 28%, while the purchase fee is only 900 yuan, less than 1%. The allocation is inappropriate. The college's books have been lost after the war and the existing collection is insufficient for application. Efforts should be made to reduce office expenses and add them gradually. (3) The college's part-time teachers should be reduced, and the teaching time of full-time professors should be reduced if it is too short. Modifications should be made as appropriate. (4) The college's course materials for each subject should focus on domestic practical problems to enhance teaching effectiveness. You are hereby ordered to comply with the improvement report.</p>

<p>Promoting Adult Practical Education</p>
<p>The agenda was as follows:</p>
<p>(1) How to promote adult remedial education. It was resolved that: A. A declaration would be issued; B. The scope of education would be Shanghai; C. The target audience would focus on adult men and women's literacy education; D. The main body of education would be the Association in conjunction with the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Cultural Construction Association, as well as various organs and groups in the special zone and individuals enthusiastic about adult remedial education; E. Implementation method: It was decided to jointly convene the Shanghai Special Zone Adult Remedial Education Promotion Association with the Shanghai Branch of the Cultural Construction Association to conduct jointly. (2) The agenda for the five joint meetings of the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee was decided to be held on April 21st at 2:00 p.m. at the Chung She on Weihaiwei Road.

<p>Issuing a Declaration on Integrating Knowledge and Action</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Teachers' Association's Declaration on Promoting Adult Remedial Education is as follows: To all cultural and educational institutions and teachers and students of schools across the country: We believe that the fundamental reason for China's weakness and decline is the invasion of international imperialism, but the low level of national culture and the weakness of national consciousness are also major reasons. Examining the educational situation of the major powers, they are far superior to China. More than 90% of the people in Germany, France, England, the United States, and Japan have received national compulsory education. Even in the Soviet Union, before the war, compulsory education accounted for only 50% of the total population. After the revolution, it vigorously carried out the literacy campaign and promoted basic education, which has now increased to 96%. It can unite and defend the country. Looking back at China, only 20% of the people receive compulsory education. Out-of-school children and adult illiterates are rampant in cities and villages. Basic knowledge of personal life is still lacking. How can they know the responsibility of the nation and the rise and fall of the country? The Association believes that the compulsory implementation of national compulsory education is a fundamental solution, which requires our government to raise funds and plan comprehensively. However, the most important short-term solution is for the national intellectuals to vigorously carry out adult remedial education and completely eliminate illiteracy. The foundation of national cultural construction and the path to national self-reliance lie in this. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau advocated literacy education and planned to implement it in Shanghai first. It is indeed a cultural movement that sees the key to the problem and is in line with the national conditions. We hope that the national cultural and educational institutions, groups, and teachers and students of major and secondary schools will do their best to open adult remedial classes, combining literacy education with civic education, so that all people in the country can read and know the nation and protect the race. To know but not to act is the shame of the wise. To have people but not to teach them is the humiliation of the scholars. May our national intellectuals sweep away the past habit of idle talk, rise up and create a style of clear discernment and resolute action, strive to eliminate illiteracy, and revitalize the Chinese nation. The members of this Association will naturally integrate knowledge and action and encourage each other with people across the country.</p>

<p>The Liang Chiang basketball team, since its southern expedition, has been gone for nearly two months. It first arrived in the Philippines, and news of its victories has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the team has left the Philippines for Surabaya, and must pass through Batavia, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, and other places before returning to Shanghai. The grand occasions of its arrival and departure in the Philippines are briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>War Record in the Philippines This time, the Philippine Chinese Athletic Association organized the All-Philippines Women's Basketball Championship, held during the Carnival. Participants included the American Central Team, the Philippine All-Stars, the All-Philippines Combined Team, the Chun Hui Team from Amoy, and Liang Chiang, for a total of five teams (using a double round-robin system). Liang Chiang was able to overcome all of them, winning the championship, and earning praise from people of various countries traveling in the Philippines. The Chinese community regarded it as unparalleled glory. Each game had thousands of spectators, and the Li spiking field of the previous Far East Games was filled to capacity, a truly unprecedented scene.</p>
<p>Record of Celebration Banquets After the Liang Chiang team arrived in the Philippines, various sectors hosted banquets one after another, including the Chinese Consulate General in the Philippines, the Chinese Association, the General Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Shang Yi Society, the Chung Hsi School, Western sports organizations, Western women's basketball teams, the Ching Nan Athletic Association, the President of Philippine Women's University, the General Chamber of Commerce, the Taiyuan Hall, various Chinese merchants, and many banquets from foreign residents in the Philippines, enhancing mutual feelings.</p>
<p>Surabaya Cables Welcome Liang Chiang stayed in the Philippines for a total of three weeks, which was quite long. Because they repeatedly won victories, Surabaya had already heard the news and sent cables of welcome. The team then boarded the Cizinecara on the 7th to leave the Philippines. The Consul General and his wife, the Athletic Association, and various groups all came to the port to see them off, shaking hands and saying goodbye, waving ribbons and handkerchiefs, making the hosts and guests feel sad.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Finance: Under Heavy Pressure from Foreign Exchange, Gold Market Sellers are Enthusiastic, Continuing Small Fluctuations at 2.60 Yuan <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market experienced a shrinking silver market, and confidence seemed to be returning. However, due to the unusually loose foreign exchange market, buyers found it difficult to be enthusiastic, which fueled selling. As a result, prices continued to fall. However, the market was mostly fluctuating during the morning, with slight rebounds in the middle. At the beginning of the morning, overseas silver markets showed declines in London and stability in the United States, and forward silver prices in Monterrey also showed a decline. Exchange rates fluctuated. Spot gold in London fell 1 shilling 7.5 pence. Off-exchange forward trading opened at 78.90 yuan, which was higher than the previous close, but still inferior when compared to the previous close. The news that Mr. Soong Tse-ven stated that the Chinese government would not adopt a policy of currency inflation was published in newspapers, and general floating speculators quickly sold, causing prices to fall. The Central Bank's posted rates revealed that the British rate was stable and the American rate declined. The Customs Gold Unit fell by 2 fen. The standard price for gold was lowered to 900.01 yuan. The market opened low in the morning. After the opening, large investors took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the foreign exchange market temporarily tightened and gradually rebounded, once breaking through 80 yuan. The upward momentum lacked sustainability. The anticipation that the HSBC posted rate would rise by 1.25 for the British and 0.25 for the American caused prices to fall again. The Kwong Bankers stuffed shillings, and the foreign exchange market hardened and fell even further. Banks seized the opportunity to buy cheap. After the decline, there were repeated rebounds. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, and the market then fluctuated. Sassoon still covered shorts, and the market then stabilized. However, the foreign exchange market repeatedly hardened, and suppliers remained strong, so the gold market followed suit and fell. However, compared to the foreign exchange market, it was still relatively stable, and many people maintained their positions after the decline. As a result, there was a rebound from the low point at noon. The sluggishness of the market was entirely due to the high pressure of the foreign exchange market. Large speculators remained inactive, and sellers became even more enthusiastic. The future is still uncertain. The morning market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The market opened at 875.40 yuan, which was 2 yuan lower than the previous close. Ta Fat, Wing Tung-tai, Tai Cheung, Fook Yue, Tai Tak-shing, Wing Lee, Heng Yue, and all advanced, gradually rising from 5 yuan and 2 yuan to 9 yuan. Ying Cheung retail investors still sold at 7.20 yuan. Sumitomo bought shillings at half a penny for June. Yue Ching, Wing Fook, Wing Wai-cheung, Fook On, and Heng Yue advanced, rising to 80 yuan. Ying Cheung, Han Heng, and Heng Yue sold, once falling to 8 yuan. Wai Cheung, Fook Hing, Wing Tai, Tai Tak-shing still had buying intentions, and rose to 81 yuan. The anticipation that the HSBC posted rate would rise by 1.25 for the British and 0.25 for the American caused Tai Tak-shing, Heng Yue, Fook Yue, Shun Mao, Ying Cheung, Cheung Tai, Heng Yue, and others to successively sell, and the Kwong Bankers inclined to stuff shillings, gradually falling. Heng Yue sold heavily and fell even further to 74 yuan. Hing Yip and HSBC bought shillings at 56.25 for June. Heng Yue, Fook Yue, and Fook Hing took advantage of the low prices to advance to 6 yuan. However, the foreign exchange market soon hardened, and Yuan Cheung, Wing Wai-cheung, Cheung Tai, Yee Foong, and Wing successively sold off, falling to 2.50 yuan. HSBC delivered shillings at 62.5 for June. Cheung Tai, Fook Hing, Wing, and Wing Lee took advantage of the low prices to advance to 3.80 yuan. Huabi stuffed shillings at 68.75 for April without success. Fook Hing, Wing Wai-cheung, Heng Yue, and Tai Hong successively sold off, falling to 2.20 yuan. HSBC bought shillings at 62.5 for May. Heng Yue, Fook Yue, Yuan Cheung, Wing, Ying Cheung, Fook Hing, and Wing took advantage of the low prices to deliver, rebounding to 5.70 yuan. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. At this time, the situation was stable. Mitsui came out with shillings at half a penny for July. Shun Mao and Wai Cheung sold off. Fook Hing, Wing, Tai Tak-shing advanced and then retreated, falling to 3.60 yuan. Sassoon covered shorts at 62.5 for June. Fook Hing, Wing, Heng Yue, and Cheung Tai once advanced to 7.20 yuan. HSBC came out with shillings at 75 for April. Heng Yue, Heng Hing, and retail investors all sold, falling to 3 yuan. Fook Yue, Chun Yuan, Wing, and others took advantage of the low prices to maintain their positions, rebounding to 6.30 yuan. HSBC sold shillings to Sassoon at 68.75 for June. Ying Cheung, Tung Chun, Cheung, Wai Cheung, Ding, Yee Foong, Wing Fook, Hing, and Wing sold off, falling to 2.70 yuan. Wai Cheung and Wing Lee took advantage of the low prices to maintain their positions. At the afternoon close, the price rose again to 874.80 yuan. The closing price was stable. The highest price during the morning was 881 yuan, and the lowest price was 872 yuan, a fluctuation of 8.80 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 2.60 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, according to the Central Bank's standard price for gold, retreated to 900.10 yuan. In terms of the closing price, it was about 25 yuan lower, and about 7 yuan lower than the previous close. The registration for this month was 872 yuan, for May 875 yuan. The afternoon water was added at 872 yuan. Red gold was about 4 yuan higher. There was still a lack of trading in the market, and the situation was extremely stable. Tianjin goods were about 7 yuan higher. The appetite of the Kwong Bankers was stagnant, and swaps were also quiet. Because there were only a few remaining for this month, only the public orders remained to be collected. If the total number of public orders was removed, only 266 remained.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. In summary, Fook Yue, Fook Hing, Wing, Yuan Cheung, Wing, Man Hing, Ta Fat, Wing Hong, Hing Wing, Wing Lee, Heng Cheung, Wing Tai, Tak-shing, and Yuan Mao Wing were among the buyers. Heng Yue, Yat Cheung, Tung Tai Cheung, Cheng Cheung, Wai Cheung, Yam Fat, Wing Yee Foong, Wing Yick Sing, Wing Tak-chien, Cheung Cheung, Heng Hing, Yuan Sing, and others were among the sellers. Tai Tak-shing and Yuan Yat Cheung Tai and Ying Cheung advanced and then retreated. Ta Fat Wing and Wing Lee advanced first and then retreated. The Ta Lien Bankers, Man Hing, did a total of over 400, netting over 100. Shun Lee did a total of over 100, netting a slight excess. The Kwong Bankers, Sang Tai and Heng Hing, did not have much activity. The total number of transactions during the morning was estimated at 35,000,110.</p>
<p>There are few remaining bills for this month, and most parties have less than 100. In summary, there are 8 bullish parties, namely Tung Foong, Heng Chien, Cheung Cheung, Hing Fat, Wing Kwei Cheung, Yun Cheung, Yu Yun Cheung, Wing Tai, Heng Chia Yun is it?

<h3 id="e208">Chinese and Foreign Merchants Unanimously Sell Off, Both Spot and Forward Rates for British and American Currencies are Loose <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign dispatches, the London spot and forward rates declined by 1875, the New York silver price was unchanged, and the Monterey forward silver price was unchanged, to 2 percent and under. The London spot gold price fell 1 shilling 7.5 pence. The British currency rose against the American currency by 875, the American currency declined against the British currency by 625, the British currency rose against the French currency by 6 pounds, and the American currency rose against the French currency by 1.375 fen. The morning opening price for the near-term British currency was 1 shilling 6 pence 625, and the American currency was 37.375 yuan, which was higher than the previous close by 0625 for the British and 125 for the American. However, due to the lack of confidence among Chinese merchants, the market hardened immediately after opening. The Central Bank's posted rates revealed that the British rate was stable and the American rate declined by 0625. The Customs Gold Unit fell by 2 fen. The process was loose. After the opening, banks engaged in mutual dealing to provide support. After entering, banks once bought in, slightly tightening. The anticipation that the HSBC posted rate would rise by 125 for the British and 25 for the American caused further uncertainty. Kwong Bankers and others then sold off again, immediately hardening the situation. Although banks and Sassoon bought in at cheap prices, it was only a slight fluctuation. Kwong Bankers and others sold off shillings, making it difficult for banks to cope, and they successively sold off. Although Sassoon bought, it lacked strength. At noon, the trend was extremely loose. The afternoon close price for the near-term British currency was 1 shilling 6 pence 8125 and 875 bid, and the American currency was 37.75 yuan, which was lower than the previous close by 125 for the British and higher by 25 for the American. Chinese merchants, such as the Kwong Bankers, sold off nearly 100,000 pounds of shillings and over 300,000 yuan of American currency. Bank buying was normal, and Sassoon was the same. The Central Bank and the Japanese bank both sold. HSBC initially bought in and then sold off. The morning trading is recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e210">Securities: Brokers Travel Early, Very Desolate Bond Market Before the Holiday, Only Customers Slightly Settling or Swapping, Spring Break for Three Days from Today Until the 8th When the Market Reopens <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was the last day before the Spring Festival holiday, and the atmosphere among the various groups was extremely idle. Most of the brokers and agents had the pleasure of traveling far away. The trading on the floor became even more desolate, with customers only slightly settling or swapping, providing a slight break. It was faintly heard that a strong group had recently requested the government to reorganize the 96 public bonds, and a declaration and its implementation procedures would be announced soon, so the future of the 96 bonds would once again be lively. Let's keep this saying for later verification. The market yesterday showed no trend, and besides several unattended stocks in each session, even if there were openings, only 5,000 or 10,000 were traded. The overall sales and tax gold shorts and 22 customs duties were slightly more active, but there was no upward or downward movement. People's hearts were slack, and trading was quiet, so the daily market price results were still mixed, with more gains than losses, ranging from 5 fen, 1 corner, or even 2 corners. The total transaction volume was 4,976,000 yuan. The gain and loss results are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>From today until Saturday, it is the Spring Festival holiday, with the market closed for three days. The 7th is a regular Sunday holiday. The market will reopen as usual on the 8th.</p>

<p>New Feng Foreign Firm Report: Yesterday (2nd) New York stock market, ups and downs were mixed, its characteristic being the plunge of six dollars in the general metallurgy sector, the weakness of canned food stocks, and the stability of public utility stocks. The plunge in general metallurgy stocks was not due to new unfavorable news, but rather the recent company's business report and dividend reduction, which continue to have a negative impact on the stock. Other silver stocks were able to hold up. The selling of canned food stocks carries significant meaning, as housewives across the country are increasingly angered by rising meat prices. Wall Street believes public utility stocks have been oversold, so their prices are quite stable. The bond market showed an upward trend. Stocks on the small exchange rose and fell unevenly, with a total daily trading volume of 530,000 shares.</p>

<p>Yarn: The market fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, with the situation becoming increasingly calm. Spot sales are still good, with continuous procurement from Guangdong and Sichuan, thus consolidating market confidence. However, foreign merchants are inclined to short sell, putting considerable pressure on the market.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Under Pressure: In the pre-market trading of standard yarn, prices for all months continued to decline, and market sentiment was dim and listless. With the continued decline of American cotton, and reports stating that Song Ziwen said he would never adopt inflationary policies, market sentiment softened. However, major bullish investors remained calm and did not sell, so the market was not entirely slack. As a result, prices for all months fell by 5, 7, 8, and 9 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, prices for near-term months still fell by 2 or 3 jiao, but when trading reached the far-term months, prices turned upward, and market sentiment was stronger. Upon investigation, Mr. Wu bought another 200 bales of May/June futures for one month, which excited the market, and far-term months rebounded. In the second session, prices continued to rise, and in the third session, Da Ji came in to sell, causing slight fatigue. The market closed calmly. As a result, prices for all months increased by 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Yu Kang sold 1,200 bales, Da Ji sold 1,800 bales, Tai Xing sold 400 bales, Gu Da sold 550 bales, Chang Feng sold 800 bales, Run Kang sold 1,350 bales; Yi Da bought 1,050 bales, Yuan Da bought 700 bales, Jin Chang bought 400 bales, Ren Feng bought 1,900 bales, Da Chang bought 350 bales, Yuan Yi bought 300 bales, and Jun Chang bought 300 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Spot Sales Still Good: Spot yarn sales are still good. The total purchased by various gangs today is 1,450 bales. Market conditions are not particularly good or bad. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market first fell and then rose. Overseas American cotton prices continued to decline, while reports stated that the authorities declared they would not adopt inflationary policies. The gold market fell, and market sentiment was somewhat dampened. However, in the afternoon, the market became tighter, as most profit-takers covered their short positions, and prices rose.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton: Morning Low, Afternoon Rebound: In the pre-market trading of standard cotton, prices for all months remained unsettled, as the decline in American cotton prices had not yet stopped, Indian cotton was lackluster, and reported news was very unfavorable to bullish investors. Gold prices fell, and exchange rates were extended, so buyers in the market decreased. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the market suddenly became urgent, with lively trading and rising prices. The reason was that a general group of profit-takers scrambled to cover short positions, and the market rose. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.15 to 0.20 to 0.25 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Da Fu sold 2,100 dan, He Xing sold 2,300 dan, Jun Chang sold 1,300 dan, Tai Chang sold 1,400 dan, Run Kang sold 1,300 dan, Yuan Da sold 1,200 dan, Yuan Yi sold 2,500 dan, Xin Heng sold 1,700 dan, Chang He sold 1,200 dan; Yuan Da bought 1,100 dan, Tai Xing bought 1,000 dan, Tong Xing bought 4,800 dan, Xin Cheng bought 2,100 dan, Fu Yuan bought 1,300 dan, Tong Ji bought 3,000 dan, Yi Chang bought 1,100 dan, Run Kang bought 2,200 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened higher due to good news from Liverpool. Dealers bought in, and spot prices were firm. Spot traders bought near-term months, so near-term prices rose by 9 to 11 points. Far-term months also rose by 3 to 4 points. Subsequently, because the government's new cotton policy had not yet been developed, the market felt uneasy. Dealers in New Orleans and locally sold, and bullish investors closed out positions, so prices gradually declined. When prices fell, dealers continued to buy, and short-sellers covered their positions slightly. According to estimates from the New Orleans Cotton Exchange, as of the end of March, a total of 2,277,000 tons of fertilizer had been used. It is estimated that spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 3 to 13 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 2 points, and futures prices rose by 5 to 7 points. Indian cotton rose because short positions were covered. Deliveries were not high. Speculators bought White Rose Creek May futures and were firm. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by one rupee, Aomula was unchanged, and White Rose Creek rose by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram of the 2nd):</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign rice customer demand continued to be active. Although the number of Yangtze River gangs was light, inland gangs were more greedy, especially the Nanjing gang. Other inland gangs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were uniformly eager to buy. Because the owners had a steady stream of customers, they repeatedly raised prices. Stockpilers, due to high import costs, held prices firm and refused to sell. As a result, the market price of foreign rice continued to rise by about 0.15 to 0.20 yuan. The whole city opened with more than 20,000 bales of Saigon high-grade and other rices, and more than 10,000 bales of Siamese Min Dang small-grain high-grade and yellow rices. However, inland demand is still strong, so it seems that continued buying will be necessary in the future. Customer Xian rice is welcomed inland, with more than 3,000 bales opened and prices also rising by 0.10 yuan. The foreign rice futures market was even sharper yesterday. In March, small-grain rice initially opened at 4.47 yuan and then rose to 4.57 yuan, a jump of 0.10 yuan in one day. In April, Saigon Yuan Grain rose to 4.85 yuan, and long-grain rice was 4.70 yuan. Market experts are still . . . say.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of Shanghai South gangs was similar to the previous day, still only 2,000-odd shi of number 11 goods). After the sharp rise in the previous market, the market situation today is still acceptable. Due to the obstruction of the market, few people inquired, and with limited demand, only 300-odd bales from the Qingdao gang were sold. People's hearts are discouraged, and the market is depressed, so the prices of all kinds of jing rice and thin paddy rice seem to be stable, and there is no significant change in the prices of Yin Bian Yuan and various grades of rice. . . . . . . . There are no boats coming down the river from Shanghai North. . . . About numbers 6 and 7. Sales of various goods on the market are slow, and the market price of white jing high-grade goods has increased by jiao, medium-grade goods have increased by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan, and the price of thin goods has risen by jiao. Because white jing rice is increasing day by day, the price of high white yuan has followed suit by jiao, and the price of customer yuan is showing a tight trend. The rest of the goods also have a tight trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw inconsistent ups and downs in foreign wheat, but most people in the market were optimistic. Because rice prices have soared in recent days, various . . . have risen slightly, and wheat, the raw material, is also in short supply. Therefore, inland stockpiling minds are hopeful. Yesterday, they made even more efforts to buy. Because various factories stopped production, short covering was active, so the market rose across the board. The market once returned to flat in the afternoon, but due to active short covering due to the holidays, the market remained firm at the close. The market price for April, June, and September rose by 0.075 yuan, May rose by 0.01 yuan, July rose by 0.025 yuan, and August rose by 0.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Because the futures wheat market was closed for the holiday, the current wheat factory demand is still active, and the owners do not insist on selling. However, there is little inventory in the market, and the market is still hopeful. Shandong Guide wheat is sold at 3.80 yuan, and secondary wheat is sold at prices ranging from 3.75 yuan to 3.65 yuan. More than 1,000 bales were opened and purchased by Fu Xin. The new wheat in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is developing very well this year.</p>
<p>According to private estimates, the average yield of American winter wheat is 490,000,000 bushels, which is a negative for bullish investors. Wheat prices still depend on the weather.</p>

<p>The green tea from the northwest and west roads of Wuyuan has always been known for its workmanship. The Zhenmei tea they produce uses various coloring materials such as beeswax, indigo, and talc. The color is quite beautiful and has been sold to Africa and Aaron . . . for a long time. However, since . . . this waxed tea has been greatly affected. Recently, Aaron has also increased import taxes on Chinese tea, and there are rumors that Africa will ban the import of waxed tea.

<p>Today, foreign merchants have sales, but the international silk market remains flat and tired (both Citibank and Yokohama fell slightly), so transactions are few and far between, only enough to decorate. User silk mills' silk sales are increasing day by day, and prices are also rising, about 15 yuan higher than before.

The next slightly 1000 . . . 100 bags were marked at 17.4 yuan. It can be seen that since the tax increase has not been implemented, the market atmosphere is gradually weakening. The guild's opening price for 24 crude sand white was 17.45 yuan, with a few transactions. The goods for re-export, arriving on the 7th of this month, were called at 5.35 yuan and were not traded. The Mian White from our factory dropped another 0.10 yuan. Zhen Yu No. 1 was 17 yuan, No. 2 was 16.9 yuan, No. 3 was 16.75 yuan, and No. 4 was 16.6 yuan. Chao Qing, due to the fall in Shantou exchange rates, . . . is good. The industry believes that sales are low and the intention to import is very weak.

<h3 id="e226">Children's Sports and the Future of the Nation <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>Ancient Chinese governance combined education and nurturing, emphasizing raising the young and caring for the elderly. It is because children possess innate intelligence, pure hearts, and lively natures. Their intellect, virtue, and physical well-being are all superior to those of adults. If we can educate and nurture them properly, each according to their abilities, it will be easy to cultivate them into talents for society and improve the quality of the nation.</p>
<p>In modern times, all countries undergoing political reforms pay great attention to the protection of people's lives. They even provide constitutional guarantees for children's lives and rights. The new German constitution after the war is a clear example. Article 122 of the German constitution stipulates: "Overwork of children, as well as moral, mental, and physical neglect, shall be protected. The federal government and other public bodies shall take the necessary measures for this." Articles 92 and 120 also contain provisions on family health and compulsory education. Labor laws in various countries are even more detailed in protecting children, with strict and special restrictions and care in laws regarding working age, working hours, education level, and physical health.</p>
<p>Our country's sages did not neglect the issue of children. They said, "Men have their duties, women have their homes, the strong have their work, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, disabled are all cared for." It is also said: "Respect the old of your family, and extend that respect to the old of others; love the young of your family, and extend that love to the young of others." Their spirit of caring for and paying attention to children is clear. Unfortunately, in recent times, education has been abandoned. Not only the state and society neglect children, but even parents and teachers do not know their responsibilities for education. They spend their days together talking about meaningless things, engaging in licentious behavior, and ruining their minds and bodies. Children are the future spirit of the nation and the cornerstone of the country. If we continue to ignore them, the harm it will inflict on the nation is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Today, on the anniversary of Children's Day, I received a draft request, so I took the time to express my feelings. I sincerely hope that those engaged in children's sports today will pay close attention to and study children's lives, children's health, children's welfare, etc., so that countless lively, pure, and intelligent children will not be corrupted by bad environments, but will grow into talents for the country and society. The benefits to the nation's future will be immeasurable.</p>

<h3 id="e228">New Children's Life and Social Transformation <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Xingya</p>
<p>Lao Tzu said: "Changing customs and habits starts gradually." Social customs are the basis for establishing a country's destiny. The formation of customs comes from gradual influence, so their removal is not the work of a day or two. The basis of social transformation lies in transforming the lives of the people. If the lifestyle is appropriate, then physiologically and psychologically, they will unconsciously move towards norms, and a good society will be formed!</p>
<p>According to the results of learning psychology experiments, human activities, apart from their instincts, can be expressed in various social actions due to the effect of habit. Once a habit is formed, if it is good, it will be enjoyed for life, and if it is bad, it will be difficult to correct. Therefore, when it comes to changing customs and habits, we must pay attention to the cultivation of habits. Since adults' habits are not easy to change, then the childhood life, education, and cultivation of various habits that adapt to society while improving society should be our major mission!</p>
<p>Now, children are affected by bad social habits, and everywhere they show the bad habits of seeking ease, taking shortcuts, being decadent, passive, scattered, and selfish. The failure of the new education in recent decades is also the reason for social unrest. From now on, we should put effort into children's education to instill in them beliefs in creation, service, struggle, and labor, as well as the spirit of loyalty, diligence, righteousness, and chivalry. These beliefs and spirits should be gradually trained in daily life, cultivated into habits, and guarded without loss. Today's children are the adults of the future. If we pay attention to social transformation, we cannot but base it on all aspects of children's lives in their flourishing years.</p>

<p>— Li Tingan</p>
<p>Does life have new and old? Both are me. Yesterday's me, viewed today, is the old life. Tomorrow's me, viewed today, is the new life. Is it that life has new and old? Today's yesterday is like the day before yesterday's tomorrow. Will today's tomorrow not be the yesterday of the day after tomorrow? What is called life is like the opening and fading of flowers, the waxing and waning of the moon. That which passes is like that, and that which comes is like this. How can there be a distinction between new and old? I have heard that those sages who cultivate themselves say, "If I hear the Way in the morning, I can die in the evening." How eager they are for a new life! However, they say, "If I were given a few years, I would be able to learn the Book of Changes and avoid great mistakes." Their consistent life seems to have new and old, but in reality, there is no distinction between new and old. How easy it is to connect, and how difficult it is to achieve! Life has no categories, but life has progress and stagnation. Advancing is new, and stagnating is old. Therefore, there can be eternal renewal, and there can be abandonment of the old today. Alas, is life new? It is not new; it is simply expanding and enriching what already exists. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek promoted the New Life Movement in Nanchang, scrupulously emphasizing propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. He calls it new in name, but seeks its meaning in the ancients. Is he perhaps seeking the way of the gentleman who devotes himself to the fundamentals? Children's health is an old term, but it is also the New Life. . . . Those who publicize it in newspapers and broadcast it far and wide, why not call it an old term? Although those who often speak empty words, today put them into practice. Those who often despise, today follow them. Those who often use it as a banner, today put it into practice physically. Why not call it a New Life? Alas, in the warm spring, only the grass and trees gain new meaning. Moreover, in this New Life Movement, we are looking forward to our comrades working for the happiness of children. Why not rise up? My comrades, let us encourage ourselves.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Overview of the Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Committee <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>(1) Purpose: This committee aims to promote social awareness of children's status and develop children's welfare, striving for the happiness of all children in the city.</p>
<p>(2) Historical Outline: In March of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), various sectors of Shanghai jointly organized the Preparatory Committee for the Shanghai Municipal Celebration of Children's Day. At that time, administrators from the four bureaus of Public Security, Social Affairs, Education, and Health, along with enthusiastic social workers, recognizing the importance of the children's movement and feeling that the development of children's welfare in the city required a permanent governing body responsible for implementation to be effective, proposed during the second preparatory meeting that Preparatory Committee members Pan Gongzhan, Hu Shuyi, and others formally organize the Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Committee as the main body in Shanghai to lead children's welfare and promote children's happiness. Hu Shuyi was appointed to draft the organizational regulations for the Children's Welfare Committee, which were submitted and passed by the preparatory committee. Subsequently, in May, the directors of the four bureaus of Public Security, Social Affairs, Education, and Health submitted a request to the municipal government for approval and registration, and requested the mayor to serve as the president. In June, President Wu Tiecheng convened the inaugural meeting at the municipal government, immediately electing executive committee members. The individuals elected were Pan Gongzhan, Li Ting'an, Chen Heqin, Hu Shuyi, and Liu Wang Liming. The organizations elected were the China Child Welfare Association representative Wang Guanyi and the Children's Morning Post representative Zhao Zengqi, among others. Subsequently, recognizing the difficulties faced by working-class laborers in factories regarding childcare, the committee established a separate Nursery Business Committee to prepare for the establishment of nurseries. In August, in accordance with regulations, groups and experts in the city enthusiastic about children's welfare were invited to serve as members of the committee, working together to advance the nursery business. The first nursery was established in Nanshi as a pilot. On September 20th of the same year, during the committee's first executive committee meeting, Hu Shuyi proposed that the government designate a "Children's Year" to promote and advance children's welfare. The China Child Welfare Association was also requested to submit a request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for forwarding to the central government for approval. The committee requested the mayor to appoint Yu Hongjun and 183 others as members of the Children's Year Committee. This was the origin of last year's Children's Day in the city and this year's nationally designated Children's Year, and is also one of the committee's important undertakings.</p>
<p>(3) Departmental Operations:</p>
<p>(1) Children's Protection Department: Upholds children's rights, investigates and provides relief in cases of child abuse, child trafficking, or other infringements of children's rights, and works to liberate children who have been harmed.</p>

<p>(6) Address: The committee's address is near Panfang on Penglai Road in Nanshi. For the convenience of all sectors, a liaison office is also located in the city center at the Municipal Education Bureau and at the Children's Morning Post at 205 Shandong Road.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Committee's Message to Children Nationwide for the 5th Children's Day <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Dear children nationwide:</p>
<p>Today should be your happiest day because the 5th Children's Day has arrived!</p>
<p>The meaning of Children's Day can be explained in two ways. On the one hand, because we Chinese have traditionally not paid attention to children's well-being, Children's Day is meant to promote it. On the other hand, because our Chinese children have traditionally not known the importance of their own position, Children's Day is meant to encourage them to become aware.</p>
<p>Adults not promoting children's well-being is certainly unfair to children. Children not knowing the importance of their own position is unfair to themselves! You must know: you are the treasures of the nation. The future of the nation will depend on you to support and maintain it. If you do not know the importance of your position and do not strive to fulfill your responsibilities, you will not only be unfair to yourselves but also to the nation.</p>
<p>Children, we already know the importance of your position and recognize you as the treasures of the nation. Therefore, from now on, we will strive to promote children's well-being. You, too, should know the importance of your position and strive to fulfill your responsibilities.</p>
<p>Children, come, you work hard for yourselves, and we will work hard for you. Let us work together!</p>

<p>Children's Day on April 4th is just around the corner. We should warmly celebrate and bless the children!</p>
<p>Dear children: you are all active, clever, healthy, and favored by heaven. Your lives are so comfortable and sweet, and your futures are so bright and splendid! We are extremely envious.</p>
<p>However, please pay attention! Time, once gone, never returns! You are all future masters, so in this golden age of childhood, do not let it slip away. You must strive to study profound knowledge and train your bodies to be strong. In the future, you will bring happiness to society and glory to the nation, and we will rely entirely on you, our respectable and lovable children!</p>
<h3 id="e236">Fishing <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Weijing</p>
<p>Dropping a line is not considered vulgar in China. The most famous story in history, passed down for thousands of years and still popular, is the story of Jiang Taigong fishing. Secondly, there is Yan Ziling's Fishing Terrace in western Zhejiang, which makes people linger and admire. As for the famous song "Old Fisherman," countless people have recited and sung it. Although the position of that famous song has been taken away by modern dance troupes, "Old Fisherman" is no longer commonly on people's lips, but its sad and stirring melody can still be heard from time to time in the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>Indeed, in ancient China, some people resigned from their official positions and retired to the countryside, holding a wine cup in their left hand and a fishing rod in their right, seeking poetic inspiration in the vast expanse of misty waters. Others were unsuccessful in the literary field or stumbled in their careers, with a belly full of depression and complaints, with nowhere to vent, so they found a stream or corner, dropped a fishing rod, spent their years, and used it to forget their sorrows and hatreds. Therefore, in the water paintings of artists, adding an old fisherman returning from fishing or currently fishing can enhance the poetry and liveliness of the painting.</p>
<p>However, just as oranges change when transplanted north of the Huai River, fishing is the same. Because dropping a line is a refined and profound pastime in China, but in foreign countries, it has become an espionage activity to explore the depth of harbors and the speed of currents.</p>
<p>The former is to embellish the lakes and mountains, how tranquil, the latter is preparing to shed blood, full of murderous intent. Both are fishing, but their natures are so different, where does one even begin?</p>
<h3 id="e237">Spring Cold <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>Everyone sings the praises of spring's arrival. The clouds in the sky are so light, the water in the river is so gentle, the peach blossoms smile, the willows dance, and even the women on the streets have shed their black furry fur coats and changed into thin new shirts, probing the new coolness that the east wind brings. Needless to say, the yellow dust on Longhua Road has been stirred up by the light hooves of horses, and the fragrant charm of peach groves everywhere has been released for poetry-seeking companions, while the pens of writers easily slip out the clichéd phrase "Spring has arrived" on the manuscript paper.</p>
<p>But spring is also like a beautiful girl, her eyebrows smiling, her eyes speaking, her lips revealing charm, her arms writing spring love; but sometimes she will also restrain her lively posture and make a serious appearance. Therefore, people look forward to a sunny and warm spring, but because of a snow, a rain, or a night of wind, they repeatedly return to the bitter cold of late winter. The sad fate of those flowers and leaves that cannot withstand the cold and freeze, withering and falling to the ground in the blink of an eye, cannot be avoided after all. Look! Aren't the daughters all rummaging through the bottom of their boxes for the heavy furs and thick coats they just put away?</p>
<p>When you think warmth belongs to you, you must look back to see the cold creeping behind you, waiting for an opportunity to strike!</p>
<p>The companions enjoying the spring are going from the city to various mountains and rivers to seek spiritual nourishment. Everyone is injecting rich joy into their smiles, but in the weather of light clouds and soft sunlight, a dove's call at dusk must warn you that tomorrow morning, when you wake up from your pillow, you will be disappointed by the sound of rain.</p>
<p>Do not dislike the heavy and clumsy winter fur coats, do not indulge in only wearing newly made spring shirts; occasional coldness will tell you a kind of life philosophy beyond travel knowledge!</p>

<p>Chapter Eleven: Evening Talk of a Miserable Life, Originally a Dream; Scattered Footprints, Wind and Rain Too Deceitful</p>
<p>Based on what he said today, he should not have a smile on his face with the kind of life he leads. Even if he smiles at people, it's not really a smile, but a cry. Who in society can see that someone else's smile is a cry? So, a person who smiles while crying can only smile while crying for the rest of their life. This evening, the lamp was dim, the house was dark, and the wind blew the door. I don't know if Yang and Jia were crying or laughing. However, the next day, Yang Huanhua had three dollars in his pocket, which gave him a little comfort. In the metropolis of Xi'an, you can still see the hard-working spirit of the northwestern people, as citizens get up as soon as it dawns. If someone is still not up after eight o'clock after spring, there must be something wrong with them. That day, Yang Huanhua woke up at nine o'clock. The half-closed door was blown wide open by the wind, and it was cool and drafty, even the sleeping curtains were fluttering a bit. Huanhua immediately stuck his head out and looked outside, only to see that the sky outside the window was gloomy. It seemed that the sun had not yet emerged from the earth. Huanhua thought that he seemed to have slept very soundly and should have had a longer time, so why hadn't the sun come out yet? Just as he was concentrating, his throat was choked by the cold wind, and he couldn't help coughing twice in a row. The waiter stuck his head in and looked around at the door, then gently called out, "Miss Yang, it's time to get up, it's already past nine o'clock." Huanhua said, "Oh! It's past nine o'clock. Is it raining?" The waiter said, "Slanting wind and fine rain, it was noisy all night yesterday, didn't you know?" Huanhua put on his clothes while laughing, "I really didn't feel anything. Has Mr. Jia in the next room gotten up?" The waiter said with a smile, "He's sleeping soundly just like you." Huanhua immediately put on his clothes and called the waiter to bring tea and water in. The waiter kept going in and out, always smiling at him. (173)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I can say that it is extremely difficult for anything small or inconspicuous to escape the Empress Dowager's eyes. So, I feel that every time I accompany the Empress Dowager on a stroll in the Summer Palace, I can always get many new insights, because as we walk along, she only needs to take a casual look and can immediately see many inappropriate arrangements or missing pieces that should be added. After she points them out, these inappropriate arrangements or omissions must be immediately removed or supplemented; otherwise, the person responsible for management will be in great trouble.</p>
<p>Ah! Just imagine how beautiful and lovely a stone floor filled with hundreds of interwoven deep red and light green colored silk threads must be! Moreover, they are arranged very neatly, a row of red, a row of yellow, a row of blue; looking at them from afar, they are really like a rainbow in the sky. The girls walk back and forth in these rainbows. They dare not leave for a moment; because these silks often need people to turn them over, to avoid too much or too little exposure to the light. If they are not dried well, they cannot be used, and the many efforts previously spent on reeling, washing, brushing, and dyeing are wasted. However, it is not easy for us laymen to distinguish whether the results after drying are good or bad. Apart from these little girls who specialize in silk production, only our intelligent and versatile Empress Dowager has this extraordinary eyesight. (284)</p>

<p>Yu San, a man who has experienced many setbacks and suffered major stimuli, is released from prison and wants to change his life and struggle again, but when he returns to his former residence, his wife and children are scattered, and the scenery is completely different. Therefore, he has to wander, searching for his flesh and blood and lover in the vast sea of dust.</p>
<p>In order to seek a stable life, he accidentally runs into a former friend, who recommends him to work as a messenger in the vault of a bank. Little does he know that the person in charge of the vault is his own son.</p>
<p>Later, as time goes by, he slowly confirms his suspicions and understands everything. His old friend from twenty years ago has occupied his beloved wife, made a fortune, and become the manager of this bank. His son is the director of the vault. However, he has already changed his life. He doesn't expose it and continues to live his life as a servant.</p>
<p>One day, the director of the vault escorts funds to another port and is plotted against by a group of bandits who use women as bait. Yu San bravely fights to take the funds back from the bandits, but he is shot and killed by the arresting officers.</p>
<p>This is a story from the new film "Human Relations" produced by Mingxing, which has the style of the Western film "The Fugitive." The portrayal of "paternal love" in the film is truly able to fully express its essence. In the near future, the film will be released at the Xinguang Theater in this city. Viewers who like the rough-line style are worth seeing it.</p>

<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The scenery of Yue is the most beautiful in the southeast. This time, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Pei Yunqing initiated a spring tour group, inviting close friends from all walks of life in Shanghai and Hangzhou to visit Shao. On the morning of the 26th, they crossed the river, and on the afternoon of the 27th, they returned to Hangzhou. Although the trip was only two days, they saw many famous places. On the Shanyin Road, they were overwhelmed with attractions. The situation of this tour is briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Upon arrival in Shao, because the Shaoxing branch of the Silk Industry Bank opened that day, more than a hundred people went to congratulate them, eating the Guan Sheng Yuan refreshments they had prepared until the bottom of the basins were facing the sky. At eleven o'clock, they took a car to Donghu, where small boats were prepared. They floated on the lake, passing through the Xiantao Tao Gong Cave, looking up at the high rocks, some facing each other like doors, and some standing alone upside down. The water was deep blue, as if sitting in a well. After feasting at Shuiyue Pavilion, they took a car to Fanjia Village Station, and then took a boat to Houshan. The scenery along the way was excellent. Artists such as Huang Binhong, Xie Gongzhan, and Wang Jiyuan drew sketches everywhere, obtaining a rich harvest. At the Yanluo Cave, they tasted tea in the newly built Fuyan Villa of Mr. Wang Xiaolai, facing the mountain and facing the water, which was extremely elegant. Beside it was a cloud stone pier, standing upright in the air, with the top standing on a pillar. There was often cloud surrounding it. Opposite the cloud stone pier was the Qiping Stone, slender and standing alone for more than ten feet, with a horizontal stone covering it, shaped like a chessboard. They then went to Duige Wei Lu, which was the place where Mr. Tao Lan Ting of the Ming Dynasty read books, opposite the former residence of Tao Wenjian Gong's Shi Kui Mountain House. The inside of the cave was suddenly bright and open, with cave islands standing in staggered rows, some like toads, some like elephant trunks, with a landscape similar to Wulingyuan. Lu Master Shen Keming showed the books and paintings he had collected to his companions, making them reluctant to let go. In the evening, they returned to the city, and the Silk Industry Bank's sub-manager borrowed the Commercial Council to hold a public banquet. After the banquet, they were divided into two hotels, Jianhu and Longshan. The next day, they hired a boat and were towed by a steamer to Yuling. The temple was newly built and more magnificent than before. The statue of Da Yu held a jade tablet and stood upright, about ten feet long, making people feel solemn and respectful. Everyone took off their hats and bowed. In front of the hall, they asked Mr. Sun, the director of the Guanzhen Photo Studio, to take a group photo of the group members. Then they visited places such as the Feiyin Spring and Bianshi Pavilion. The spring water was clear and flowed continuously, and they all scooped it up to drink, and it tasted very sweet and cool. The pavilion had a stone button, more than five feet high, which was said to be a tool for water control. It had been smoothed by people's stroking and had red tendons, resembling Han jade. There was a stele on the left of the temple, written by Zhang Taiyan, detailing the merits of Da Yu's water control and the details of this reconstruction, with words such as "If China is not destroyed, the virtue will be widely spread, as if in the Divine Land, no one can compare for a hundred generations." In the afternoon, they went to the banquet of the County Chamber of Commerce. To leave a souvenir, Huang Binhong, who was seventy-one years old, was publicly elected to write the preface, and Xie Gongzhan, Wang Jiyuan, and others drew pictures, entitled "Following the Sound of the Xiuxi," and listed the names of the people of the time. Shaoxing has been opening up streets, improving bridges, facilitating transportation, and its commerce has been becoming more prosperous in recent years, with a thriving atmosphere. In the same capital city, although my He also has a Xing character in its name, the emerging businesses are not as good as those of Shaoxing. When they returned to Hangzhou in the evening, they felt that their teeth and cheeks were still fragrant, because the dishes at this banquet were all rare, such as chicken waist, which is the kidney of a castrated chicken, with a tender and fresh taste. Xidan, also named Zanyunlong, is a live egg that has been half-incubated into a chick but has not yet grown hair. It is unique to Shaoxing and cannot be found elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Children's Day and the National Goods Movement <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Today is the universally observed "Children's Day." The reporter feels that it is very meaningful to discuss the relationship between children and the promotion of the national goods movement during "Children's Day." Therefore, I have seized this topic to express some shallow views as follows:</p>
<p>We know that children are the future masters of the country and the pillars of society. The future national fortune of our Republic of China depends entirely on the children of today to take responsibility. In particular, we hope that the parents who are responsible for educating children, as well as the teachers in schools, will take on this training responsibility in advance, so that there will be great hope. These are some simple reasons that everyone understands and no one will deny.</p>
<p>Now, let's put aside other issues for the time being and focus on the national goods movement. I believe that most of the responsibility also rests with the children, because the minds of children are pure and their emotions are passionate. In the pure minds and passionate emotions of children, instilling education to promote national goods and training habits to use national goods, I believe that the results will be very great and effective. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the teachers who pay attention to children's education will also work hard in this area.</p>
<p>This year is the "Student National Goods Year" designated by various groups. Children are part of the student population, and their responsibility for promoting national goods is naturally greater than in previous years. However, most of the actions of children can be said to be passive. They do what adults tell them to do. For example, when it comes to purchasing supplies, adults like to buy from foreign stores. What power do children have to stop them? Even if they understand that buying foreign goods is wrong, they can only understand it in their hearts. Therefore, if we want to train children to buy Chinese goods, the first step is for the parents, elder brothers, teachers, and guardians to set a good example for them to see, which will be effective. However, if there is only lip service and contradictory facts, the effect of promoting national goods will be minimal. Therefore, I hope that on this "Children's Day" that is universally observed throughout the country, on the one hand, we will explain the meaning of promoting national goods, the reasons for buying national goods, and the aspects of promoting national goods to the lovely and dear children, item by item, so that children know that promoting national goods and using national goods are things that children themselves should do, an obligation that should be fulfilled. Once this concept is formed, children will have a deep understanding of national goods, and when they grow up, they will naturally achieve the goal of not wearing anything but national goods, not using anything but national goods, and not eating anything but national goods. When that time comes, our Chinese national goods movement will achieve great success and great achievements.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of today's "Children's Day," I sincerely offer some of my opinions and ask everyone to pay attention and do some work for the national goods movement.</p>
<h3 id="e245">How the National Goods Industry Should Utilize Children's Day <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Time flies like a white horse flashing past a crack, and the annual Children's Day has arrived again! Everyone knows that children are the future masters of the country. Children are innocent and carefree! A pure silk thread is dyed blue if it's dyed blue and yellow if it's dyed yellow! How parents and teachers should guide them onto the right track is the most important thing. This year is "Children's Year," which is also the designated "Student National Goods Year." Aren't many primary school students children? Sow melons and you get melons! Sow beans and you get beans! How should our national goods industry take advantage of this "Children's Day" opportunity to cultivate children's habit of loving to play with national goods from a young age! The Chinese National Goods Company's holding of a children's broadcasting competition during this vibrant festival is truly skilled at taking advantage of opportunities. I hope that other national goods markets will also launch children's parties, children's amusement parks, and children's speech contests, so that many little angels can actively participate! Whoever has a deep impression of national goods and whose speech has a central idea will be rewarded! Or sell children's products at half price for one day! This depends on whether the national goods industry will take advantage of this great Children's Day to leave a "sow melons and you get melons, sow beans and you get beans" seed for the word "national goods" and create a beautiful harvest in the future!</p>
<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3 id="e246">A Vernacular Poem <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Children, children, remember that the national crisis is severe. The people are impoverished, wealth is exhausted, and the nation's strength is depleted.</p>
<p>A batch of imported goods empties our silver reserves. Don't just complain about bad harvests, don't just blame the old farmers. It's a thousand times wrong, ten thousand times inexcusable, to have let the word "modern" become so widespread. You want to be fashionable, I want to stand out, ultimately making the dumping of foreign goods successful.</p>
<p>This year is the Students' National Goods Year, don't be deaf and dumb anymore.</p>
<p>Little friends, rise together, work hard and diligently.</p>
<p>From now on, in what you eat, what you wear, and what you use, only choose domestic goods.</p>
<p>Persuade everyone you meet, sound the alarm everywhere, save the nation's strength, revitalize the nation, all depend on the children.</p>
<p>This little vernacular poem is especially written to be read to children on Children's Day of the Students' National Goods Year. Children, you are all very ambitious and determined. My own eight-year-old daughter, ever since I told her to use domestic goods, always asks her mother when she's getting dressed, "Is this Chinese made?" When she's eating something, she always asks her mother, "Is this foreign made?" If she hears it's foreign, she won't wear it or eat it, and she throws a tantrum until we buy her Chinese made goods. People share the same sentiments, hearts share the same reason. Thinking about it, I know all children are like this. So, parents, if you read this poem to them, they will certainly be overjoyed and willing to take on this responsibility on their little shoulders. It's true that if we want to see the day that domestic goods flourish, we must rely on children's firm resolve.</p>
<p>Notes from a Visit</p>
<h3 id="e247">A Record of the Opening Ceremony of the Invincible Soap Factory <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>—A Good News Story Amidst the Economic Downturn—</p>
<p>The Invincible Soap Factory has opened! In this year when industry and commerce are experiencing a severe economic downturn, it is probably not excessive to have such a relatively gratifying event to cheer everyone up.</p>
<p>Before discussing the opening, I should first talk about the origin of this factory.</p>
<p>Seeing the four characters "Invincible Soap," I believe readers will definitely think of "Invincible Tooth Powder." Yes, this Invincible Soap Factory was jointly established by Mr. Tianxu Wosheng, the inventor of Invincible Tooth Powder, and Mr. Weng Rongbing's family industrial cooperative. Mr. Weng is a soap-making expert, and the family industrial cooperative also had the intention of adding soap manufacturing. Thus, the Invincible Soap Factory was born very smoothly.</p>
<p>The factory is located on West Sports Association Road in the Jiang District. It is a newly built, modern two-story building. The lower floor is the manufacturing department and warehouse, and the upper floor is the packaging room. Before the opening ceremony, I took a trip with the receptionist. Because the time was too short and I am an amateur, I felt like Grandma Liu visiting the Grand View Garden, finding everything new and strange, but understanding nothing. However, according to the person leading my tour, those machines are the most modern. At that moment, I truly felt as happy as if we had recovered the lost territory of the Northeast!</p>
<p>On that day, there were approximately five hundred guests in attendance, including female guests and even foreign guests - Westerners. It was truly a grand and lively occasion. First, Mr. Tianxu Wosheng unveiled the factory and gave a brief report. Next, Mayor Wu's representative, Mr. Li Dachao, delivered an address, followed by speeches from four or five other guests. Below are some fragments that have not yet faded from my memory.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy person was Mr. Tianxu Wosheng. That day, Mr. Chen was truly radiant, exuding a spring-like atmosphere amidst the bright spring sunshine. He humbly asked the guests to provide feedback on the factory's products at any time. He also excitedly hoped that China would no longer have foreign soap. In short, Mr. Chen that day truly seemed to have regained his youth.</p>
<p>Li Dachao's speech on behalf of Mayor Wu was naturally worthy of attention. He felt gratified that the establishment of the Invincible Factory had a great relationship with the prosperity of the city center, and he expressed that the municipal government would definitely provide the factory with various conveniences and support!</p>
<p>Among the speeches by the guests, the words of Mr. Cheng Shouchong, the General Manager of the Shanghai Mechanized Domestic Goods Factory Federation, are also worth noting. First, in a rather amusing tone, he predicted that the Invincible Soap Factory would have unlimited development, the reason being that Mr. Tianxu Wosheng is a senior figure in the domestic industrial sector, and Mr. Weng is a rare soap-making expert in China. Now that the two are working together, it's truly like a peony with green leaves, complementing each other. From now on, the Chinese market will no longer have imported soap, which is something that can be predicted. Secondly, he believed that the Invincible Factory's complete equipment, modern machinery, and meticulous material selection are rare in China, which should be a gratifying thing in today's industrial sector. Thirdly, he expressed sympathy for the establishment of the Invincible Factory in the Chinese area, because although the concessions are also our territory, they are still subject to their restrictions everywhere. Therefore, he believed that the establishment of the Invincible Factory in the Jiang District has at least two meanings: in a passive aspect, it can avoid various unreasonable restrictions in the concessions; in an active aspect, it is helping the government to complete the prosperity of Zhabei.</p>
<p>"National...Goods..." The whistle emitted an echo that seemed to shout out "National Burden." We walked out of the "National Goods" Invincible Soap Factory amidst the echo of "National Goods."</p>
<h3 id="e248">Quickly Create New Domestic Stationery <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>No one can deny that the "economic aggression" of imperialism in our country's market can be described as meticulous, exhausting all the "plundering" and "extracting" capabilities. We know that in the huge trade deficit over the years, there are entire batches of grain, large amounts of wool fabrics, rayon, etc. But, everyone seems to be very vague, unaware that there are also millions of dollars of imported stationery - these daily necessities consumed by general intellectuals - also infiltrating the entire society in every possible way. This is such a terrible fact. This year is the "Students' National Goods Year," and how should we try to make up for this deficiency, eliminate this number, and solve the most important stationery problem in education? It is the most important work of this year.</p>
<p>However, what we should pay attention to at the present stage is that the trend of the times is constantly evolving, and the items needed by a society are also changing to adapt to certain needs. Therefore, at present, there are many new stationery items in our country that cannot yet be manufactured domestically. If we can find ways to avoid them and use domestic goods, it would be best. However, the reality is definitely not that simple. Old writing brushes and Huizhou ink are already being phased out in various special situations. For example, invoices used by domestic goods manufacturers and companies still require pencils and carbon paper. How can we replace pencils with writing brushes in English classes in schools? In view of this factual need, we can therefore firmly shout out the slogan "Quickly Create New Domestic Stationery."</p>
<p>As far as I know, domestic goods manufacturers who can already manufacture new stationery include DAHUA Pencils and MINSHENG Factory's red and blue inks. Mr. Pan Yangyao's Zhongnan Industrial Cooperative, which he founded last year, was the first to create fountain pen barrels that are beautiful, sturdy, and far superior to imported ones. This is of course the best phenomenon for the future of domestic stationery. We can continue to work hard and bury ourselves in our work. Although new stationery is not yet complete (such as nibs, paper, etc., for which there may be no domestic substitutes), in the near future, we can always achieve our wishes.</p>
<p>In short, we can draw the following conclusion regarding the stationery problem: "Within the possible range, we must try our best to use domestic goods and strive to promote new domestic stationery. But, what we still have hope for is that people in the domestic goods industry will quickly formulate an overall plan and create new domestic stationery to meet the needs of society. Do not hesitate or wait and see, and sit back and wait for foreigners' economic domination."</p>

<h3 id="e250">How to Save Industry and Commerce? <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Speaking of this, some people will definitely suspect that those without capital, how can they help? It should also be investigated what kind of capital is most needed. In my opinion, first, for any enterprise, the preliminary plan is the most important. The seeds of success or failure may have been planted in the business plan long ago. However, with a reasonable plan, it must be implemented faithfully according to the plan. If changes in the situation are discovered, the plan should be quickly revised. Like fighting a war, you must be brave and also have wisdom. Second, since the work purpose belongs to business, the records and accounting of numbers must be accurate. This is the importance of accounting. Many industrial and commercial institutions have sloppy accounting. Because the accounting is not done clearly, they do not necessarily know where the money is being made, and they do not know why they are losing money. Fraud is also easy. In this situation, victory is accidental, and failure is inevitable. If someone lends money without paying attention to the unreasonableness of my plan or my failure to implement the plan, and lends money to help my business without paying attention to the sloppy accounting system I adopt, such lending is no different from waste, and even no different from deliberately increasing the borrower's debt that cannot be repaid. I think if the purpose is narrowly to lend money, everything can be ignored except for lending. Now that the purpose is to provide relief, while helping people with capital, at least you must also advise them on two points: the basic business conditions, what is the plan, and the main business tools, whether the accounting is appropriate or not. This is helping people with good intentions. You must not misunderstand it with other meanings. Looking at it with a broader perspective, to truly save China's crisis, the various organizations, from the government to the society, must all move towards soundness and form a solid national strength, be qualified to coordinate with the enemy to resist and at the same time be qualified to coordinate with people's goodwill, and when I think of the harm of economic aggression by various countries to our country to this extent, the annual trade deficit is tens of millions of yuan, how to break out of the encirclement, only by fundamentally reorganizing the national industry and commerce and helping them to form a sound organization, each industrial and commercial enterprise, has a sound organization; each kind of industry and commerce, has a sound organization; the entire industry and commerce, has a sound organization, manufacturing can be refined, costs can be reduced, transportation can be practical, sales can be promoted, industry and commerce can have vitality, and the country can also have life. But to help industry and commerce, you must find a suitable opportunity. This is the right time!</p>

<h3 id="e251">Prospects for Children's Happiness on Children's Day <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>The twentieth century is a century that has expanded children's rights through the women's rights movement. Ellen Key simply calls it the "Century of the Child." This can be proven by the calls for promoting children's happiness in various countries and the formation of various undertakings for children's happiness. In China, there are regulations for Children's Day and Children's Year, and there are also organizations for children's happiness associations and childcare undertakings in various places. All these phenomena can be said to be a surge in the high tide of the world's children's happiness movement. The tumbling of the waves is only one side of the superficial phenomenon of the flowing water. As for the silt and stagnant water at the bottom of the water and the jagged rocks lying across it. These are often neglected by people who appreciate the Jiangchao. However, in fact, if the silt is not cleared and the rocks are not removed, the water flow will not be able to discharge smoothly, and those so-called tides are only a flash in the pan. The children's happiness movement in China seems to be able to symbolize this.</p>
<p>In the noisy city, every Children's Day, one organization holds an infant health competition; another place is specially opened for children, providing entertainment at no cost; some exhibit educational supplies for happy children; some give children sweet candies. So, on this day, in the streets, in the entertainment places, in the institutions that host or also operate children's education undertakings, we can encounter groups of children. The expressions on their faces are all "smiling" and "excited." So generally adults admire that the children of this era have indeed gained immense happiness. This is one side of the children's happiness movement, which is also a side commonly seen by happy people in the happiness movement.</p>
<p>What about the other side? I must first introduce what I saw with my own eyes:</p>
<p>"...At dusk, I went out of school for dinner and passed by the Taishi Bridge, when I suddenly heard a peddler shouting, his voice was so miserable and the name of the thing he was selling seemed unfamiliar. A companion talked to him and found out that what he was shouting was selling children. A passer-by asked the gender of the children he was selling, and the seller replied: 'There are boys and there are girls,' because the basket he was carrying contained his son in the front and his daughter in the back. Someone felt sorry for him and gave him money, and advised him to take both children home, and the seller thanked him with tears. He said that his fields and houses were flooded, and his wife drowned. If he sells the two children, he can still beg for food to live, otherwise he will stay together and wait to die... "March 15, 18th year</p>
<p>This kind of selling people is not only a local and temporary phenomenon.</p>
<p>When the entire rural economy collapsed to a sharp point, the farmers had sold the land, sold the furniture, and finally sold their wives and children. Children who are sold are either slaves or maids or prostitutes. Here, what we see is only the wailing of children, and we do not see the happiness of children.</p>
<p>Every day, as soon as the east shows the fish-white dawn, the ruthless factory siren has issued an emergency assembly order. Among the ranks of adult workers who go to work, many children participate in the same journey. Although they are greedy for sweet sleep, and although they need sufficient sleep. But at this time, they have to wipe their sleepy eyes and rush to the factory. As for life in the factory, according to the Labor Yearbook, the life of apprentices in a woolen mill is as follows:</p>
<p>"Children who are developing work for 13 to 14 hours a day, and their living and eating conditions are extremely poor. The room is full of wool dust and debris. Most of the apprentices have lung diseases and follicular conjunctivitis... They have not received education and have no opportunity to study. Although charitable organizations have tried their best to promote and enable them to receive general education for one or two hours a day, they have failed to realize it due to the opposition of the owners."</p>
<p>In China's 1930 Factory Law, although there is a deadline for "men and women under the age of 14 who have been working in factories before the promulgation of the Factory Law shall submit the names, native places, ages, dates of entry, types of work and nature of work of the workers to the competent authorities for verification within two months after the implementation of the Factory Law." But most manufacturers turned a blind eye, how can they understand the suffering of child labor? Therefore, most of the children who go to work in factories due to family economic pressure only have the attacks of diseases and suffering, and do not see the joy of laughter.</p>
<p>Some children often wander around street corners, and many children come to garbage cans to pick up waste goods. People sometimes curse that these children must not know the importance of literacy or that they are incorrigible and cannot be cultivated. This is somewhat unjust. Because the current schools are really "standing on the walls of the palace for several feet," which are unattainable. In particular, the better primary schools cost dozens of yuan a year, and when registering for school, if there is no acquaintance with the school authorities or the request is not strong enough, they are still "looking at its walls" and have no opportunity to be educated. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics in the 19th year, there were 41 million school-age children in China. There were 7 million students and 34 million dropouts. So most of the children are excluded from cultural influence. The enjoyment of culture is the source of happiness in life. Since most Chinese children are like this, they only have the pity of becoming increasingly ignorant, and they do not have the right to intellectual standards.</p>
<p>All the above-mentioned malformed phenomena that accompany economic relations. When society evolves to the current stage, they are especially "too numerous to count." In short, they all represent the dark side of the children's happiness movement. The facts on this dark side are equal to the silt and rocks in the running water. It hinders the development of the entire children's happiness movement.</p>
<p>If the movement we are advocating is not only for loving apple-like small faces that are lively and vigorous, not only for seeking talents and rejoicing in their "malleability," not only for "reviving the family reputation" to "glorify the family," but for paying attention to the education of the entire Chinese child, which holds back the development of the entire national spirit. Then, the first thing we should pay attention to is not to stand and watch the tide and applaud it, but to find ways to dredge and remove the silt and rocks that block the flowing water.</p>

<p>— Yecao</p>
<p>The warmth of spring is still the same as in previous years.</p>
<p>But Huangzhuang is not the same as before!</p>
<p>In the spring of previous years, at the south end of that open space, the Land God Temple located at the intersection always had lively incense fairs. People were like bees, in groups, crowding around, as if swimming in pleasant circumstances, everyone had a heart of indescribable joy. Old women held their grandchildren and came to the fair from remote places. Women usually rarely left their homes, but at this moment, they were putting on rouge in front of the mirror, braiding red braids for their daughters, and then, taking long benches, three or five of them together, went out so awkwardly.</p>
<p>But what about Huangzhuang now?</p>
<p>After two years of famine attacks, people can no longer resist life. A kind of terror built on hunger makes young people have no nostalgia for their homes. They began to flee to that ideal blessed land!</p>
<p>Day by day, young people ran away as much as they could. What was left were the old men and women who were unwilling to leave their hometown, and their young children. When the young people kindly advised them that staying in their hometown for a long time would make them starve, Father Huang raised his voice and shouted rudely:</p>
<p>"Is it that easy? You should also think carefully, even though there is little property, it was always passed down by the ancestors. If you leave, where are you going to get it!"</p>
<p>"If you don't leave, what are you going to eat, drink the wind!"</p>
<p>"Hmph! Kid! Tree bark, can't you eat it? And tree leaves."</p>
<p>"Hiss!" The young man hissed anxiously.</p>
<p>No matter how stubborn the old man was, these young people finally left their homes one by one.</p>
<p>The old people eked out their dying days, eating one meal a day—thin porridge made of tree bark crumbs and flour—with their grandchildren. Life is long, but the tree bark has a time when it will be eaten up; this, first of all, caused panic among the old people.</p>
<p>People are ultimately smart, and often when unsolvable problems come, they will come up with solutions. One day, the old woman looked at Father Huang disappointedly:</p>
<p>"What should we do when the tree bark is finished?"</p>
<p>"Eat tree leaves."</p>
<p>"What if the leaves are all picked?"</p>
<p>"Water algae, there are a lot of them in the river, people don't know about it!"</p>
<p>Yes, after many days, Father Huang brought back a package of water algae. He walked with special energy, showing a smile that had not been seen for months; he seemed to feel very proud in his heart, at least his family could have a full meal this time, because he had such a big package in his hand.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the next day the whole family swelled up as thick as their necks and faces, and their tongues were stiff, making it difficult to speak. One grandson innocently shouted:</p>
<p>"Grandma, your face is like a moon, round, so is Grandpa's; what's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Hmm!" She hummed softly, biting her trembling lower lip tightly.</p>
<p>Water algae are poisonous!</p>
<h3 id="e253">By the Cao'e River <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dong</p>
<p>It has been five years. Five years ago, with what state of mind did I cross this Cao'e River? Thinking back, I truly have a sense of past and present!</p>
<p>It was a winter morning. The sun had just smiled, and soon the sky became gloomy again, and the wind was more ferocious than wild beasts, roaring terrifyingly.</p>
<p>Walking to the riverbank, it began to rain and snow. The mud road was very slippery, and if you were not careful, you would fall. The ferry was lonely and silent in the rain. The wind, rain, and snow played a lonely tune, and the Cao'e River slowly sang the elegy of the exiles. We crossed this small river dimly with emotions that were more sentimental than the exiles.</p>
<p>Now, the peach blossoms on the riverbank are in full bloom, the willows have sprouted tender green buds, the light yellow river water is constantly flowing eastward, and the golden sun is all over the mountains and rivers. And me, I am still crossing the Cao'e River with all the sentimental emotions I had five years ago.</p>
<p>I let my sight search as freely as possible. I want to explore the traces of changes in the past five years in this small world; however, I am disappointed. I can't see any changes in the past five years. People are still bustling, rowing boats, drawing river water, and porters are still signaling to me with drunken faces with their rough poles in groups: "Do you want a porter?" The peddlers along the coast are still shouting noisily, and the people going in and out of the small restaurants still seem to be the same Shaoxing men who curse "Ma Du Bi" as soon as they open their mouths. I even feel that the children playing stone marbles on the river beach are still the same group as five years ago!</p>
<p>However, the things that I personally experienced before have changed too drastically.</p>
<p>The second train arrived. I got into the carriage and closed my eyes tightly. I don't want to see anything anymore. I am afraid of finding traces of our past in the fine sand.</p>
<p>Doo! The car is moving. I lowered my head, wanting to throw all the past behind the car. Unintentionally, I actually recited an ancient poem: "When I left in the past, the rain and snow were heavy, but now I come, the willows are gentle."</p>
<p>The wheels rubbed against the rails, squeaking and squeaking, and the locomotive wailed. I pricked up my ears to listen, and the Cao'e River gradually disappeared into the morning light!</p>

<p>— Wo Pu</p>
<p>(4) The Zhongshan Wolf</p>
<p>Kang Hai's "Mr. Dongguo and the Zhongshan Wolf" miscellaneous drama was written to criticize Li Mengyang and vent his own resentment. It was probably not based on factual events. At the same time, Ma Zhongxi, who had also suffered at the hands of Liu Jin, wrote a "Biography of the Zhongshan Wolf," using prose to express the same story. Niu Xiu, in his *Gu Yu*, raised objections to Ma's work, as seen in the "Jade Sword Error" entry:</p>
<p>"The 'Biography of the Zhongshan Wolf' was written by Xie Liang of the Song Dynasty. Although it was a playful piece, it must have been alluding to something at the time, but he did not want to state it explicitly, using this to vent his anger. Yu Jianzun heard it said, 'When Li Xianji was imprisoned, Liu Jin urgently wanted to kill him and wrote a slip of paper, saying, "Save me, Dui Shan!" His family went to tell Kang, who immediately mounted his horse and rushed to Jin's gate to plead for him. The next day, he was released. Later, Xianji became jealous and harmful to Dui Shan. Ma Zhongxi wrote the "Biography of the Zhongshan Wolf" to satirize Xianji.' Dui Shan's rescue of Xianji was originally not in the hope of repayment from Xianji. Even if Xianji had resentment, how could it be as extreme as the "Zhongshan Wolf"? Moreover, its literary style is rich and flourishing, which people of the Song Dynasty could not have done. Ma Dongtian had regrets about Xianji and wrote this to scold him, so it was thought that it was written by Dongtian. Ming Wenying still followed this, but he did not examine it deeply."</p>
<p>Dong Ji's *Complete Catalog and Abstracts of Qu Opera*, Volume 5, records the Zhongshan Wolf entry. Examining the full text of the Biography of the Zhongshan Wolf, it also says it was written by Xie Liang of the Song Dynasty, with a note at the end saying: "According to the *Record Compilation*, it was written by Ma Zhongxi." The abstract author probably received inspiration from Niu's *Gu Yu*. It is also possible? Niu's saying of "writing to scold each other" is a possible explanation, but Xie Liang's person seems to be unknown. Neither book mentioned it. In short, whether attributing the Biography of the Zhongshan Wolf to a Song Dynasty writer is accurate or not will be put aside for the moment. The spread of this "ungratefulness" story should have a much earlier history.</p>
<p>In the table of contents, the abstract marks the author of the Zhongshan Wolf miscellaneous drama as Ma Zhongxi! This article examines and says:</p>
<p>"People at the time used it to criticize Li Mengyang. (Omission) People at the time wrote the Zhongshan Wolf miscellaneous drama to satirize him, or it is said that it was written by Hai."</p>
<p>The author of the abstract did not definitively attribute the author to Dui Shan, only repeatedly saying "people at the time," and did not involve Ma at all. This is probably because the abstract quoted the Biography of the Zhongshan Wolf, noting "it was written by Ma Zhongxi, etc." The editors misread this, thinking that it referred to the miscellaneous drama, thus leading to this error, without examining it. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e256">Mr. Juqing (6) <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>After hesitating for a few days, Zhang Wencan finally came, followed by Widow Zhang wearing a moon-white bamboo cloth vest. Both mother and son looked very gloomy, as if something unexpected had happened.</p>
<p>Letting her sit down modestly, the first thing she said was:</p>
<p>"Mr., we, A'can, have come to say goodbye to you. He's leaving tomorrow to go to the city to learn business."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Mr. Juqing answered with only one word, as if he had heard a thunderbolt out of the blue.</p>
<p>"Yes, to learn business in a cloth shop in the city. It's his uncle who arranged it." She sighed softly and continued, "The child is so young, and he's going to a strange place far away from home. I'm all alone at home, so I'm really worried. Originally, according to my idea, he should have learned more from you, Mr., for another three or four years, and then go out when he's seventeen or eighteen. That would be much better! But his uncle said: It's difficult to find business opportunities now, so it's better for him to go out early if he has the chance... Alas, it's just that A'can is unlucky; his father died early!"</p>
<p>Tears hung on her anemic face as she looked sadly at her son.</p>
<p>Wencan stood aside with red eyes, staring blankly.</p>
<p>"A real man will have to go out sooner or later. A'can is quite sensible at home, so I'll just let him go. But it's good to be at home for a thousand days, but it's hard to be away for even one day. It's always hard to eat someone else's rice while learning business!"</p>
<p>The students stopped reading aloud, and eight or nine pairs of small eyes stared at them, making the air eerily quiet. After a long while, Mr. Juqing comforted Widow Zhang, saying:</p>
<p>"Don't worry. Wencan is a very sensible child. He'll definitely be successful in the future. Don't worry!"</p>
<p>"Really? Thank you for your kind words, Mr.! A'can, you must 'endure and win.' Be ambitious, and don't forget what the teacher said!" She turned back to the teacher solemnly and said, "In the future, if we have letters to exchange, we'll have to trouble you, Mr."</p>
<p>Wencan nodded, unable to speak. The tears that filled his eyes finally burst forth and streamed down his face.</p>
<p>After Mr. Juqing saw the mother and son off, he himself almost shed tears.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Juqing's private school was not the only one in such a miserable situation; all the other private schools were the same, and most were even worse off than his. Strangely enough, the sacred educational cause in this town has not only failed to attract students and create a blossoming field of talent but has also resembled a dying lamp with little oil, dim and bleak, relying only on the faint light of a single wick to support the dilapidated situation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the common enemy of the private schools in the town—the school—is also in a somewhat precarious state.</p>
<p>At the end of the first month, less than half a month after the district elementary school opened, news of their brewing trouble spread throughout the town.</p>
<p>The district elementary school is a notoriously poor school. The principal is often concurrently held by a school board member in name only. The three teachers are usually unemployed young people drifting around the local area or colorful characters who have drifted back from other places, who, when asked, may have some connection to the school board member; occasionally, there is a teacher from another place, often a scholar of the disheveled and bohemian type. As for salary, the principal receives twelve dollars a month, and the teachers receive five to eight dollars. Every year during the winter and summer vacations, after school is dismissed, the teachers often have two or three months' worth of salary unpaid, sitting around and waiting in vain. Those who become teachers usually do not enter this school unless they are at their wit's end.</p>
<p>However, there are people who are enthusiastic about education, and quite a few want to become school board members of the district elementary school.</p>

<h3 id="e257">Not a Trivial Matter <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Reading the number three newspaper, within the so-called yellow news, suicide events can be summarized as follows: (1) Mrs. Zhang, a Shanghai woman, whose husband has been unemployed for more than a year. The family's livelihood depends on her work at the Meifeng Silk Weaving Factory in the United States. However, her income is very meager, and there is often a danger of running out of food. Thinking about the long future ahead, how can she maintain it? Out of resentment, she suddenly had the thought of ending her life. She secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. (2) Ying San'er from Changzhou, who worked in the iron cart business, suddenly committed suicide by taking poison at the Yong'an Hotel on McEnne Road. In a suicide note to his mother-in-law, he said that he was heavily in debt and unable to repay it, so he had no choice but to do this. (3) (Seven-world legend?) The young man Yue Rufeng, due to economic difficulties, actually planned to die. He went alone to the Southeast Hotel on North Mud City Bridge and secretly took a heavy dose of Lysol poison and committed suicide. (4) Lin Su, a student at the Customs Taxation School from Guangdong, was inherently slow, so he failed every exam. He was usually depressed. Recently, another small exam was approaching, causing him to overuse his brain and have a nervous breakdown. Fearing that he would not be able to graduate and hold a position in the future, he became more stimulated every day and suddenly became weary of life. He took a kitchen knife and slit his throat.</p>
<p>Suicide, this was something that attracted attention a year or two ago. But now, even though these words reveal traces of blood, the general public has become numb to it. What does it matter if a few people commit suicide? However, recently, this trend of suicide has shifted from the middle and upper social classes to the general public, from individual cases of disappointment in love or humiliation to large-scale occurrences with economic hardship as the root cause. If we observe the frequency of suicide and examine its more serious social significance, then we must say that it is indeed not a trivial matter.</p>
<p>Just as the entire situation is heading into danger, China's national economy has reached the point of being "forced to hang itself." From rural bankruptcy to industrial decline, under these circumstances, following the farmers in the countryside killing their children and committing suicide as a family, this "Paris of the East," Shanghai, is also entering this dead end. Store closures and factory shutdowns are almost "commonplace." What will happen to these many laid-off and unemployed people? Many people whose opportunities for survival have been deprived and who have not seen the root cause of this are sacrificing themselves to this unknown weariness of life!</p>
<p>Therefore, the seriousness of suicide lies not in the individual's "great liberation." It symbolizes the suicide of the national economy and the suicide of the national destiny. To try to salvage the situation by relying on some kind of economic support from others, hoping to obtain a bit of "rain and dew," is not this method of drinking poison to quench thirst tantamount to suicide?</p>
<h3 id="e258">Sparks in the Spring Fields <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Kemin</p>
<p>("Wildfires cannot be extinguished, the spring breeze blows and they are reborn." In March, the piles of ashes in the fields are full of sighs and longings for the past generation. They also include the depression of young people and the lost love of young widows. All of this drifts into the sky with the paper butterflies.</p>
<p>Those who have died have finally died, and forever. And those who are destined not to die will eventually climb into the earth holes helplessly. The posture of life and procreation is formed in such a way. The convergence of the stream of life is the desolate yellow earth.</p>
<p>And those who can truly fight against the iron laws of nature, it can only be said that they are the wildfires in front of the tombs during the Cold Food Festival. They flicker constantly and stubbornly with the breath of the spring breeze, struggling, as if to proudly boast to the dead spirits in the earth holes--flickering, and then flickering again.</p>
<p>The sparks in the spring fields are terrifying!)</p>
<p>When I arrived at the Tan Family Lane with the cart driver, I could already see a touch of spring in the wild fields. Living... I drifted far away from the land I loved, and this time, when I saw the spring in the small villages of the north again, my memory of the wild fields was decorated with many new graves and mounds.</p>
<p>"So many graves!" Yes, I understand that the people of my homeland, who I had in my thoughts, all silently (?) climbed down into the yellow earth under the misfortune of the troubled times. But what I remember are those honest, trustworthy lines engraved on the old, dark faces.</p>
<p>The cart driver clicked his tongue and, with an indignant and garrulous expression, cracked his whip hard on the back of the animal, turned to look at me, and made a sound of "hee," like a sigh, but also like a bitter smile—</p>
<p>"Sir, your family is blessed, so you don't know much about it. This year, the people in the countryside are all unlucky. Some have died, some have slipped away. The rest are weak and can't run far. They can't leave the small river and the patch of sun in front of their old houses. So they are determined to live each day without knowing what the next will bring, until the day they die."</p>
<p>The spring fields are not suitable for narrating unpleasant events. Moreover, aren't those piles of new mounds and the ashes of paper money in the wild fields telling me enough? So, I wanted to be silent.</p>
<p>But the old cart driver's past suffering simply could not hold his tongue—this was really not easy. He took a breath and then clumsily spit out a string of painful sounds—</p>
<p>"The countryside has become unrecognizable in recent years—the soldiers fought a battle, followed by a series of famine years. Times are getting worse every day. Life in the countryside is not easy... The people in the town who sell rice, oil, soy sauce, and groceries can't make a living either. They have all 'let go of the horses'— During the season of the great floods in the autumn, many old folks died, many died..."</p>
<p>"The men have all slipped away, leaving their wives at home to starve—what kind of talk is this? Like that, the prettier ones hook up with peddlers from out of town. What can you say about this world! When their husbands died, they burned some wildflowers in the fields. That's how it is: the dead are dead, and those who have left will never return."</p>
<p>Listening and talking, the person was listless, and the cart dragged its wooden wheels on the muddy road like a rat gnawing on something, making an uncomfortable noise. This time, the shadow of my homeland truly appeared before my eyes, but what a dark shadow!</p>
<p>The sparks in the spring fields are endless, and in the distance, there are piles of paper ashes with black smoke rising. Spring sweeps by, but endlessly sparks little bits of fire, like representing the suffering of a group of people, and also like symbolizing another kind of endless depression that crosses the barren land of the north.</p>
<p>This year's Cold Food Festival is not suitable for spring outings. The sparks in the fields are brewing another kind of unpleasant meaning: "The dead are dead, and those who have left will never return."</p>
<h3 id="e259">Daughter of Phoenix <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>Starting from the foot of Hanshan Mountain along the banks of the E'xi River, you must struggle to climb the high mountains and steep ridges all day long, pass through countless desolate valleys and deep forests where there are no people, before you can drag your sore steps into Phoenix Village from Puwei Ridge at dusk when the birds return to the forest!</p>
<p>In the middle of the overlapping mountains, you can move forward and listen to the low奏 from the secluded deep forest and the gurgling water, suddenly flash to see a beautiful and clear leisure of the human world, making people suddenly drunk! This is Phoenix Mountain, Phoenix Village. More than ten years ago, it was almost completely isolated from the outside world.</p>
<p>The women in this deep mountain, like the Peach Blossom Spring, are very special. Later, the people of the first county town called them "Daughters of Phoenix," which has a very rare meaning. Maybe it's because the mountains are beautiful and the water is clear, and the scenery is too clean? Although the women are extremely hardworking, they are blown by the wind, sun, and rain all year round, but their skin is still delicate, white, clean, simple and innocent. They have inherited customs from their ancestors for hundreds of years, and there has never been such a thing as foot binding. Unmarried girls wear a long braid. Married women must get up at five o'clock every morning and spend an hour putting on makeup. Their hair is smeared with a lot of tea oil and combed into a complex and huge machine-like shape, inserted with many ornaments, and the back is combed into a protruding large axe-like shape, which is very strange. Moreover, as long as they step out of the boudoir, in the family, or in the farmland, they must cover their heads with a square, thick, black-blue cloth, and red silk thread is sewn on the green edge of the cloth. Both ears must be pierced</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>with small holes and hung with earrings. At any time, the sleeves of the shirt must be the same as the palms of the hands, and the length must cover the knees. This is neither like a cheongsam nor a short shirt. No matter whether it is hot summer or spring, they always wear black cloth clothes as usual, and there will never be a second type of clothing. And I have never seen them wear socks, except on the day they are brides. Wearing shoes is also very rare. They always like to drag a pair of wooden clogs, and even the wooden clogs are taken off as soon as they step into the house. Most of them are barefoot from a distance. Almost every sole of the feet of the daughter-in-law is cracked. Even if they go out to visit guests, it is rare to drag slippers, and it is simply impossible to wear shoes. Some wealthy old ladies are forced by their sons to wear socks, and she will find it very troublesome and annoying.</p>
<p>Almost every family farms. Regardless of the rich or poor, women of wealthy families must also go barefoot to the fields. This is really a strange custom! They are very strong. Not only are all the things in the family done by women, but also the work of planting the fields. Women must work more than men. Moreover, it is the responsibility of women to go to the deep mountains to cut firewood. If men go to the mountains with women, they will be laughed at. There are also many women who go over the mountains to work as coolies. That kind of hard work is truly beyond the reach of any other women. Therefore, the productivity of women is often stronger than that of their husbands. No, she worked hard than others, and the treatment she received was even more bizarre! Her husband is like a young master! But their parents must also make their wives work hard all year round. The husband is like a noble master, and the wife is like a lowly servant. I could not understand how they lived such a husband and wife life when I was young. So what reason makes women like this.</p>

<p>With the Opinions of Bai Hong, Zhang Kunzhai, and Dai Hongxun</p>
<p>Since this column published several letters about easy characters, the editor has received many letters from readers, some of which are about the selected easy characters, added consultation; some are discussing how to promote easy characters, and most are telling us what they know about easy characters. Their enthusiasm for easy characters is admirable, but some readers have not seen all of the 300 easy characters that have been selected, so although they have written dozens of easy characters, in reality, very few of the 300 easy characters have been adopted; some readers have written many easy characters, all of which are already in the 300 characters. Isn't this a waste of many readers' energy and time? At the same time, I have received many letters from readers asking us to publish all of the 300 easy characters in this column every few days for their reference and use. This request cannot be fulfilled because of the limited space in this column. Therefore, in order to remedy the above two things, the editor has asked the Easy Character Promotion Association to print the 300 characters into a table. If readers need to refer to it, please send a one-cent postage and the editor will send a copy. Regarding the letters discussing easy characters, a part of them will be published below:</p>
<p>Bai Hongjun's opinion: After reading several simplified characters listed by Yu Fangjun, the character "垒" is actually a different character, read as "磊," meaning a cannon-fort or a high-fort, and cannot be used as a simplified character for "垒." The simplified character for "垒" should be "垒."</p>
<p>Also, in the 300-character list selected by the Easy Character Promotion Association, "穀" as "谷" and "够" as "勾" are both inappropriate, because "谷" and "勾" have independent meanings of their own. In fact, the simplified character for "穀" is usually written as "槖." The characters "漢" as "汉" and "嘆" as "叹" are not commonly seen. If you change "叹" to "咲," it seems to be more popular. Also, the character "發" as "蕟" is not as good as "発." The character "縣" as "县" is not as good as "" because this kind of drawing only exists in print, and it does not exist in cursive writing. Now, following the editor's intention, I will list the easy characters I know below: 春作 "", 作 "察" 歷作 "厤".</p>
<p>Zhang Kunzhai's suggestion: I am very much in favor of the promotion of easy characters. Now I would like to put forward some opinions and hope that everyone will discuss them.</p>
<p>When we usually write the character "編," we probably all write it as "編," and the same is true for the other characters with the "糹" radical. Everyone can recognize them when they are written. The "言" radical can also be simplified by a few strokes. For example, "詩" is written as "诗" and "誠" as "誠." Changing the "鴻" character with the water radical to "鴻" is also more convenient. I wonder what the gentlemen who advocate easy characters think?</p>

<p>Opening "Lamenting the Battlefield"</p>
<p>Only for fame and profit do they seize military states. Slaughter and killing cycle endlessly. How many heroes and gentlemen. With ambition they want to be kings. But only see the river flowing east. How many famous generals are left? Only to have their bodies wrapped in horsehide and return to their graves. A mound of yellow earth like a steamed bun. When fighting, heaven and earth are dark. Mountains and rivers change color in sorrow. The sound of the reeds and drums is about to end. Brave men each move their spears. A battle divides victory and defeat. How much green blood fills the mountain trees. The lady dreams after midnight. The mournful sound of the night watch drums has not ended. White bones are like mountains, dry for a long time. The setting sun accompanies the years for a long time. Only her hero's blood in the tomb. Protects the people's livelihood with the most excellent merit. I come to mourn alone today. Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, grass and trees are sad. For thousands of years, we have fought against each other. Everyone shares the same hatred with the enemy. Only then are we worthy of the hero's name.</p>

<p>Yu Fu Murders Duke Yin</p>
<p>Alas! What corrupts the world's heart for righteousness is the murder of Duke Yin. Profit is what people seek, righteousness is what people shun. If being righteous had no misfortune, people would still be unwilling. How much more if burdened with misfortune? Duke Yin managed a country of a thousand chariots, but he relinquished it to Duke Heng. Duke Heng, in turn, did not appreciate his heart and murdered him. He had the highest integrity, yet he suffered the cruelest misfortune. The world will point to Duke Yin as a warning and avoid speaking of righteousness. What I have heard is different. People all believe that the murder of Duke Yin corrupts the world's heart for righteousness. I alone believe that it can encourage the world's heart for righteousness. Why is this? The murder of Duke Yin was not because he sat idly doing righteousness, but because he did not do enough righteousness.</p>

<h3 id="e265">The Six Major Stars Awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1934 (Part 2) <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>(2) Subsequent Evaluation</p>
<p>The honorable awards were finally revealed on the night of February 27th. As a result, Clark Gable for "It Happened One Night," Norma Shearer for "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," William Powell for "The Thin Man," Grace Moore for "One Night of Love," Frank Morgan for "Affairs of Cellini," and Claudette Colbert for "It Happened One Night" were awarded, totaling six people, half male and half female.</p>
<p>However, after the announcement, problems arose again. Among the above-mentioned six people, male and female stars, which two's art has reached the highest peak and ranked first?</p>
<p>But this is bound to disappoint you. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences not only does not list the order of rankings, but even the results of each person's evaluation among the six people, how many votes they received, will not tell you, and they publish the list in the order of the first letter in each person's English name.</p>
<p>Therefore, we found that in the list, the order of the female stars is Claudette Colbert first, Grace Moore second, and Norma Shearer third.</p>
<p>As for the male stars, Clark Gable is first, Frank Morgan is second, and William Powell is third.</p>
<p>So, in the above list, we cannot identify who is first. Even what method the Academy used to select on the night of February 27th, outsiders do not know. Similarly, which film in the past year can be the representative work of the year.</p>
<p>After this list was announced, what made the people of Hollywood feel surprised was that two actors were awarded for starring in the same film—Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were both awarded for "It Happened One Night." Since the Academy handled this award, it has never happened that two actors were awarded for one film; this is the first time!</p>
<p>In Film City, the general opinion was that Norma Shearer's performance as Elizabeth Barrett Browning in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" was enough for her to win the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Award for 1934. As a result, they really guessed right. William Powell could at least be included in the initial selection. The collaboration between Gable and Colbert was also considered by anyone to have a chance of winning.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the opposing side, some people were upset about Frank Morgan's award. They all said that Morgan's award was stealing the positions of Constance Bennett and Fredric March. However, some people also thought that Morgan deserved to be selected. Perhaps even Morgan himself would be surprised to see his name on the list!</p>
<p>Columbia originally did not attach importance to the film "One Night of Love" until after the evaluation, when it discovered that there were many reasons for it to be awarded. In this film, Grace Moore's singing and expression reached the highest peak. Therefore, she was able to occupy a seat among the three winning female stars. This film has been listed among the twelve best films of 1934 in Hollywood. The director, Victor Schertzinger, also won an award for this film. People in the art world all recognize that several songs in "One Night of Love" can be called the highest peak of art. (End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e266">Review of "A Wicked Woman" <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Chan Fei</p>
<p>A Wicked Woman</p>
<p>— Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>Although the original name is titled "Wicked Woman," it actually portrays a virtuous mother and good wife, because the protagonist's killing of her husband in this film is for the sake of her children. Her tireless struggle is also for the sake of her children. In other words, for the so-called happiness of her children, she finally raised her children from a state of hunger and cold to adulthood, earning the status of a good citizen from a bandit. Moreover, she is a woman with a very good conscience. She has a kind nature, so she will never forget that harming her husband is an unforgivable sin in the eyes of God and a heinous crime unforgivable by national law. Therefore, she believes that her children's mistakes are all divine retribution, and she finally acts on it. But because the audience sympathizes with her, in the end, reason, national law, and human sentiment are combined, and she, who should have been sentenced to death, is acquitted. She has fulfilled her oath to God and received amnesty from national law (seemingly joking with the law a bit). In addition, she remarries to her ideal husband. This wicked woman gives people with old ideas a very good impression.</p>
<p>In the feudal era, the protagonist, Naomi, was not necessarily a revolutionary woman. Shooting her husband, struggling hard, supporting herself, and sacrificing herself for the happiness of her descendants. However, this is a superficial observation. If we explore the inner workings of the work more thoroughly, we will inevitably discover the screenwriter's intention to vigorously maintain the old social system. Naomi's killing of her husband is precisely the screenwriter's deeper way to maintain the existence of old morality. She kills her husband because her husband cannot live in poverty, because her husband wants to take risks, and because her husband cannot be a righteous gentleman with a moral conscience. Therefore, she kills her husband precisely to eliminate harm for society and enable her children to become moral people. Naomi in this film is the perfect person in the eyes of the upholders of morality. She is a good mother, and later marrying a newspaper editor will inevitably also make her a good wife. However, she is ultimately an ideal character! It is difficult for us to see authenticity in it.</p>
<p>Now let's look at how the authors (including the director, actors, screenwriters, etc.) create their characters and how they use old-fashioned ideas to move the audience.</p>
<p>On a stormy night, in that small house by the water, the poor man's wife kills her husband. At this critical moment, his son wakes up. She cannot help but endure her frightened heart to comfort the child to sleep, singing a lullaby very lovingly. Soon, she rows a small boat and throws her husband's corpse into the river bottom in the midst of a storm. … This scene, whether it is the sound effects, the acting skills of the new actress Mady Christians, the photography, the director Charles Brabin's grasp of the tension and rapid changes in emotions, or the screenwriter's use of her to show the ruthlessness of killing her husband and immediately show her love for her children, all combine to become a brilliant technical performance.</p>
<p>Later, we hear the protagonist confessing to God, because she wants her daughters to live in sin, waiting for her children to become adults, she vows to turn herself in and atone for her sins. Some time later, she returns from working in the factory. The eldest daughter is cooking, the second daughter is secretly wanting a foreign doll, and the son is washing his younger brother while playing. She immediately urges her daughter to work, urges her son to study, and the bathing of the younger son depicts the peace of the family. After a burst of laughter from the audience, she cruelly burns her second daughter's foreign doll (the second daughter's personality serves as a foreshadowing for her later elopement), followed by her heartbreaking crying, which gives people a great feeling.</p>
<p>Twelve years later, the children have grown up and have their own professions. Here, the mother explains her children's professions and personalities by driving an old car, and also begins to explain her love affair with the newspaper editor who is her son. During the rest time after dinner, the younger son plays the violin, the second daughter plays the piano… filling the family with happiness. After the children go to bed, she and the editor talk very congenially, while depicting her inner sorrow. The second daughter meets her lover at night, and the sorrow of the disabled is portrayed on the younger son's football. … In these places, there are very cinematic depictions. As for the mother and children crying together before leaving home to turn herself in, on the train, and in the courtroom, all of them show technical success.</p>
<p>In all aspects, it shows the authors' proficiency in technology. In order to uphold morality, they vividly portray their ideal perfect person, which precisely illustrates the great power of film works to move people. New ethical films can certainly serve as authentic things for the new era, while old ethical concepts are also fully used as tools for preaching in the old society. Therefore, "A Wicked Woman" is still an extraordinary work.</p>
<h3 id="e267">About "I Was a Spy" <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>The war blockbuster "I Was a Spy" is a glorious production of the British Gaoxiang Company. The main actors are Conrad Veidt and Madeleine Carroll, whose reputations have long spread throughout the world. The entire film's plot is based on the history of espionage in the European war, writing about a Belgian woman who, forced by the German army's lewd power, nurses wounded soldiers in a hospital behind German lines. Only the sounds of tragic cries and moans, calling for mothers and seeking children, are unbearable to witness and unbearable to hear. Furthermore, because of the subversion of the country, she is regarded as a daughter of a fallen country. She does not hesitate to sacrifice her own life, secretly serving as a spy, and performs outstanding service for the country. Her ambition and actions are admirable. In addition to the tight plot and profound performances, this film also has various amazing scenes of airplane bombings. It is heard that it has been scheduled to open at the Paris Grand Theatre on Xiafei Road starting this Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e268">"The Fugitive" Now Re-released <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Qingyun</p>
<p>The Art China Film Company's great production of this year, the music and song film "The Fugitive," which has been praised by Chinese and foreign newspapers, has been sold out every day and every show since it was released at the Jincheng Grand Theatre on the 21st of last month. Subsequently, because various theaters and production companies in this city had scheduled to hold a meeting at Jincheng on the 31st to welcome Mr. Tao Bosen, our representative attending the Soviet Russian International Film Exhibition, and Jincheng also decided to re-release "Song of the Fishermen" for a few days from that day, "The Fugitive" was temporarily suspended. Now, due to the requests of the majority of the audience, "The Fugitive" has been decided to be re-released at the Jincheng Grand Theatre starting today (4th).</p>
<h3 id="e269">"The Golden Watch" to Begin Filming Soon <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Cai Chusheng's new work after "New Woman" has been praised by all parties for the script "Human Zoo" he wrote last year, so the Lianhua authorities also plan to have Cai direct and film the play. However, because "Human Zoo" has many actors, and several main characters still need to be found, and the background is mostly in severe winter, it is not suitable to engage in filming at this time. Moreover, after the two factories are concentrated, a new film must be started, so Cai Chusheng decided to put this script aside temporarily. And in the next ten days, he buried himself in work and completed his script "The Golden Watch" (provisional title). Regarding the backbone of this play, it is based on a famous Russian work. However, in order to enhance the dramatic power and suit the national conditions, more excellent supplements are added, making it a very moving film drama. It is expected that this film will greatly benefit children. It is heard that the main characters have been selected as Ge Zozhi, a child prodigy discovered by Lianhua, and Chen Sujuan, who had good results in "New Woman."</p>

<p>— Pei Yuan</p>
<p>Manna's child fell ill with whooping cough, which is highly contagious. Suqiu still took her own child along every day. But as a result, Suqiu's child was unfortunately infected with Manna's child's whooping cough. So when Manna's child recovered, Suqiu's child fell ill. When Suqiu and Meng'ou took their child to the outpatient clinic of Jiren Hospital, they happened to meet Qiao Jie, whom they had not seen for many years. Qiao Jie had also come to treat his wounded right wrist. It turned out that Qiao Jie had left Meng'ou's house when the January 28 Incident broke out. He joined the front line to fight, injured his right wrist, and after the war ended, he was demobilized and wandered the streets. At the same time, they also met Manna and Liu Ying, because Manna's child was discharged from Jiren Hospital on this day. As they were preparing to get into the car, Meng'ou and Suqiu happened to carry their child out of the hospital. When Liu Rong saw Meng'ou, he immediately stepped forward to greet him, making him feel ashamed, embarrassed, and angry. But Manna pretended not to recognize Meng'ou. Although Liu Rong was willing to use his car to send Meng'ou and others back, Meng'ou declined.</p>
<p>On the road, Meng'ou rebuked Suqiu for why she had concealed it from him. Suqiu replied very sadly, "I hate that you wouldn't let me go, so I had to keep it a secret." Meng'ou nodded proudly and said, "What bad luck, to run into this pair of villains today." The disease of Meng'ou and Suqiu's child worsened, but they had no money to hire a doctor to treat him, so they could only watch helplessly as their beloved son groaned on the bed.</p>
<p>In the absence of a rescue method, Meng'ou thought of going to Qiao Jie to find a way. But when Meng'ou found the place where Qiao Jie lived, it was when Qiao Jie was being kicked out by the landlord for not paying the rent. At this time, it was when the wind and rain were showing off their power to each other, and both of them were drenched in the rain like drowned chickens. "Is this society treating us too cruelly?" Meng'ou uttered this painful cry. Qiao Jie comforted him and said, "Meng'ou, don't be discouraged, the future is still there, we should work hard." "Then please come and live with us!" But Qiao declined and said, "Thank you, I'm used to wandering now. Having a fixed place makes me feel annoyed. Goodbye!" Saying that, he carried a bag of clothes and went forward in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>When Meng'ou stared at Qiao Jie's gradually diminishing back, two people approached Meng'ou and asked, "Mr. Lin, long time no see. We've been looking for you everywhere. It's such a coincidence that we met... Our newspaper office is short of an editor and would like to invite you to take on the position..." Meng'ou went with them.</p>
<p>The wind and rain did not stop exerting its power, while on the other side, Suqiu was crying and her sick child was constantly shouting in his mouth with a weak voice, "The sound of the car is ringing, Dad brought the car back."</p>
<p>Meng'ou followed those two people to the newspaper office, met the editor-in-chief, and agreed to give Meng'ou an editing fee of 150 yuan per month, but the prerequisite was that Meng'ou first write an article on selling the country, because this newspaper office had a background. But although Meng'ou was poor and unemployed, he refused to betray the country for personal gain and willingly be a traitor. He firmly refused to agree.</p>
<p>Meng'ou's child died in the thirst for his father to bring a car like Xiao Rong's, and when Suqiu's hand touched his beloved son's nostrils and stopped breathing, she was shocked as if she had lost something, opening her mouth, permanently opening her mouth. She didn't cry, didn't cry loudly, and didn't cry softly, but the tears that followed from her eyes were bright red blood!</p>
<p>Meng'ou came out of the newspaper office, on the way home in the wind and rain, his clothes were wet, dragging his student's footsteps, the sound "da ta, da ta" rang, his face lost the smile of a living person, the dead man looked terrible!</p>
<p>"Graduation is unemployment, how many pounds does a diploma sell for?" This is the central issue of "Elegy of Life." (End)</p>
