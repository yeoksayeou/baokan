<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國對英法宣言覆文之影響</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>英法倫敦宣言。包含締結四種公約。同時邀請　國復返國聯。唯德國覆文。僅僅表示贊同天空公約之締結。而於其他各點。則不置一辭。意嚮何居。國外輿論。殊不一致。有謂德國此舉。旨在離間英法之步調。有謂意在造成反俄之戰線。於是國際視綫。莫不集注於舉足重輕之英國。蓋英若徇德之請。許德僅締天空公約。則英法之步調。自必爲之乖離。而東歐之局勢。亦必復趨於緊張。故德國此一步驟。多少含有上述二種作用。唯據昨日歐電而觀。英國態度仍在確守本月三日英法倫敦談話所議定之程序。認爲英法所議各點。有連鎖關係。不容僅取其一點而遺其他。同時對於德國請求英德先行談判一點。亦有婉辭之表示。以是而觀。英法之步調。固未因德國覆文而凌亂也。再則。蘇俄方面。雖對英國態度。稍懷疑慮。然英國已將英法倫敦談話之結果通知蘇俄。又曾明白徵求蘇俄方面之意見。由此言之。英國對於蘇俄之意嚮。似亦願加以尊重。更就昨日莫斯科電而觀。蘇俄之態度。實與法國桴鼓相應。即和平之維持。當爲整個的而非局部的。不容偏重於西歐而忽略於東歐。於此可見不僅法俄之關係。無所變化。即英俄之關係。亦未受德國覆文之影響。更有可以注意者。即奧總理休士尼格因德國未能放棄其對奧之野心。故亦僕僕道途。分訪法英當局。以謀鞏固奧國之獨立。就此數點而觀。德國覆文之作用。已蒙受相當之失敗矣。</p>
<p>我人前已言之。德國之願望。似在放棄其對西歐之野心。而保留其對於東歐中歐行動之自由。故其心目中之和平。甯爲局部的而非整個的。反之。在法俄方面。則爲整個的而局部的。揣德國之所以不願有整個的和平制度者。蓋以此一制度一旦建立。德即無從謀失地之收復。領土之擴展。故以德國之地位。而接受英法議定書之全部。則不啻全然入於法國外交之圈套。宜其不能不有所保留也。至於法俄之所以渴求整個和平者。蓋以現代戰爭。往往牽一髮而動全身。一方有事。他方即有捲入旋渦之虞。如上次大戰。發端僅爲塞奧之爭。曾幾無時。全歐爲之鼎沸。故認局部之和平不足保障全歐之和平。以今日各國關係之錯綜複雜。一隅之動。難免不影響及於全局。故就事論事。欲求和平。自當以全局之和平爲鵠的。惟目下歐洲各國。僅以相互之牽制。勉强維持和平。德之覆文。雖未足破壞此種平和之局勢。而歐洲眞正全局之和平。則亦决非目前種種縱横捭闔。互相牽制與對立之局勢所能造成耳。</p>

<p>［東京］王寵惠氏今晨繼續會見林陸相談論頗久、林陸相表意見如左、</p>
<p>中國應首先制止排日之言行、其次為中國之排日侮日、刺激日本之感情、至為顯著、乃成為沮害中日提携之一大原因、中日關係逼至今日之狀態、其主要原因當為過去排日侮日之結果也、中國各處之排日或對於少年青年之排日教育、似覺擁有相當之根蒂、南京政府對於此種情形、有無矯正辦法、余顧承教、在日本對於中日提携、當然擁有充分誠意、余則切望貴國方面對於上述各點、首宜表示充分誠意為盼、</p>
<p>王寵惠氏答、</p>
<p>中國依賴歐美行使排日等等情形、當然絕無此事、且更無此項想像、但我國地方寬大、内中或有一部分人士作此項思想者、亦在所難免、中國極力主張中日提携、以爲中國應取之唯一大道、固知之悉矣、但中日雙方之間、亦不無種種複雜情形、當以互相協力而除去其原因、關於此點、務請貴大臣加以充分之顧慮、在國民政府對於取締排日，决非毫無誠意、乃以種種事情未能及早如願、是以爲促進中日兩國之提携、吾人甚願披誠努力也云云、（二十一日日聯電）</p>

<p>余自就任外務大臣以來、今已一年有半、其間尚未着手於中國問題、此爲事實、余覺日本倘急於對華發生誤會、深恐造成此項結果、認爲可慮、故先對於中國以外之各國行使外交工作、而將中國延至後方也、假使在更換内閣之際、余未能留任外務大臣、則余一生所念願之徹底對華外交、竟未能着手而告終、亦未可知、所幸今日日本之眞意已承各國諒解、余之一身對於蔣介石氏之態度、毫無疑慮、倘余所抱此項信念均屬錯誤、則東洋之和平必被顛覆、關於余之信念、中國要人亦有傳言、爲東洋和平計、自當要求恊力也、（二十一日日聯電）</p>

<p>對阿决採軍事措置</p>
<p>軍隊萬餘待命續發</p>
<p>羅馬　國防最高委員會最近舉行會議四次、頃已閉幕、本日發表公報、詳述戰時意國自足自給之可能、該公報内稱、國防最高委員會已完成各項任務、凖備及時採取必要手段、使一旦遭他國挑釁時、意國可立於不敗之地、又委員會就緊急情形發生時之各種必需品、逐一研究其生產來源、並擬定方案、於危急時可將此種必需品之生產消費直接加以統制云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　國防最高委員會昨日發表公報、詳述戰時意國自足自給之可能、國防最高委員會發表公報、詳述議會工作、此乃汎繫黨秉政十三年以來之第一次、莫所以如此公布者、乃因人民有所憂慮、故以此安慰之、此與汎繫黨最高會議以公報説明歐洲有危險時意大利作如何軍事準備、正復相同、國防最高委員會所公布者、特别為民事動員、至軍事動員已能按照預定條件進行、此由一九一一年級後備軍之動員、可以見之、關於預防毒瓦斯一層、曾經特别研究、所得結果、已於各地展覽會中陳列之、國防最高委員會昨日所發之公報、將各種代用品予以列舉、此種代用品清單、乃在大科學家馬可尼指導之下、由全國研究院加以整理而製成者、此種研究、足以證明意大利努力謀取得經濟之獨立、意大利決定縮减外貨之輸入、此項决定使意大利工業、不能不在本國覓取共所需要之原料、而不仰給於外國、又限制進口數量之命令、在事實上不啻關閉意大利門户、使大部份外國產品不能進口、此種命令可視為意大利工業之動員、此項命令所定條件如此嚴厲、若意大利工業果能依常態進行、則國防最高委員會所稱、「戰時意國能自足自給」之說、可得到事實上之絕對證明矣、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>奧法外交談話</h3>
<p>不干涉内政公約爲主題</p>
<p>［巴黎］奧國總理休樞尼格偕外長魏德格來法訪問、業於昨日夜間啟程、晨報載稱、「法奧兩國談話、將以中歐互不干涉内政公約計畫爲主題、此項公約重在改造多瑙河流域、設能成功、則中歐時局必能歸於甯靜」云云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>維也納　休樞尼格總理啟程赴法前、向哈瓦斯社代表發表談話、「對於奧國現在所採取之政制、吾人决不容許有侵犯之餘地、蓋欲使多瑙河流域乃至歐洲局勢、歸於常態、則此種政制、實大有功效也、」總理繼又謂、彼之政府、無論在内政或外交方面、均爲前陶爾斐斯總理所定政策之忠實繼承者云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>維也納　奧國總理休樞尼格及外長華登耐格、已於昨晚八時十分、首途巴黎倫敦、以冀國際間對於奧國之抗德運動、予以更有力之援助、英法兩國亦如意國、深願奧國不受希特勒派之政治及領土野心所侵略、略休華二氏擬向英法外長切實詢明、如國社黨再擬推翻奧國政府、兩國將取何種態度、而奧國之前途、實以兩國之答案爲轉移、如奧國政府確能依賴意法英三國軍事財政之援助、則以後仍可反抗德國、否則惟有向德媾和、德國自收回薩爾之後、國社黨已加緊對奧活動、薩爾投票結果一經發表、奧國境内已充滿國社黨之宣傳、要求奧國人亦投票自决、現政府雖盡力奮鬥、然以去年二月曾力禁社會及共産兩黨、故左傾右傾皆所不能、政府因此不願即時舉行大選、如休華二氏此行成功、自不必再向他黨取好、而仍繼續建造天主教集團國家、以竟前總理陶爾斐斯之功、再此次談話之背景、亦有恢復哈布斯堡皇室　一事、休氏爲熱心之帝制派、人所共知、惟以國際關係、仍言復辟尚非其時、觀察者謂彼之言此、係因歐洲大國及小恊約國尚未同意召返沃都大公、故此次休氏當探詢英法、以覘時機是否成熟、可使捷克及南斯拉夫不再反對、休氏之復辟理由、爲奧國人民多願牽制、故沃都即位、則國社運動自滅、與法討論者再有羅馬恊定問題、奧國對於該項恊定、當然非常感激、惟如德國不願簽字、終歸無效、至於倫敦恊定、奧國亦將要求取消和約所定陸軍三萬人之限制、大概休氏將要求以非正式軍隊如天主教挺進隊及内衛團等、併爲正式軍隊、而英法兩國將予以同情之考慮云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>正式牒覆英法蘇俄闡明立塲</h3>
<p>成立東歐互助公約</p>
<p>爲參加空防約條件</p>
<p>［莫斯科］法國駐蘇大使阿爾方向蘇聯外交人民委員長李維諾夫遞説帖、聲明自法總理佛蘭亭·法外長賴代爾·與英政府當局在倫敦會商訂立倫敦恊定以後、英法政府願知蘇聯政府對於上述協定主旨之意見、二月十九日英駐蘇大使契爾斯敦亦致函李維諾夫、聲述同樣意見、蘇聯政府昨日乃令其駐英駐法大使向各該國政府遞呈覆文如下、</p>
<p>「倫敦會議之後曾發表公告云、此項項議「目的在謀歐洲各國更密切之合作、以鞏固世界和平、」同時「在制止彼種足以促成戰機之傾向」、蘇聯政府對於此項聲明至表歡迎、蘇聯政府早以在目前塲合、澈底裁軍既不能實現、監督與限制軍備亦屬難能、故遏止國際間發生戰事之唯一辦法、乃在眞願排除戰禍之國家之間、締結區域互助公約、現英法當局既已規定締結保障歐洲各國（特别爲最易受害之地點）安全之公約、故蘇聯政府逖聽之下、無任欣慰、同時倫敦會議曾以一國如在公約所規定之塲合受人襲擊、則他國必立予援助、蘇聯政府認爲此點、已較前更進一步、在目前塲合、歐洲如有戰事發生、必不能局限於一隅、故蘇聯政府以爲在此涉及歐洲各部之統一計劃之下、吾人必須承認爲保全歐洲全土之安全計、確有互相依賴之必要也、因此之故、蘇聯政府認爲倫敦會議目的、即組織歐洲安全之實現、必待倫敦公告内所列各種區約安約與恊定全部實現而後可、反之、如對此種或彼種恊定加以忽視、則不唯「鞏固和平希望」之旨不能達、有關領土内之和平亦將慫恿其破壞焉、蘇聯政府願意相信此項公告之起草者、亦抱如此思想、同時前此即在倫敦會商以前曾經若干國家討論之區域公約、不僅不受中傷、且能由倫敦恊定獲得新的贊助焉、倫敦恊定締結以後、吾人得謂歐洲四强即蘇法英意四國及小恊商與巴爾幹恊商國、均贊成一種思想、即目下必須採取最急迫最有效之步驟、用互助公約之辦法、以箝制軍事的侵略、上述各國共有人口三萬六千五百萬、即佔全歐人口百分之七十、同時歐洲其他國家對於鞏固和平步驟、亦多抱同情、故具有目下促成戰爭危機之傾向者實屬少數、如此塲合、乃自歐洲最大多數之國家、齊心恊力、爭取和平、仍不能以其必要之手段、完成鞏固和平之任務者、其誰信歟、蘇聯政府在以上述精神、令其全部且毫不分割的實現條件之下、對於倫敦恊定表示歡迎、且熱望其以堅定之精神全部實行云云、（廿一日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>英閣决議轉達法外部</h3>
<p>應否答覆俄照會待商</p>
<p>談判程序將先德後俄</p>
<p>［巴黎］英國内閣之决議、已正式轉達外長賴伐爾、頗引起此間報紙之熱烈議論、及種種猜測、有數報紙認英國對德將提出某種問題、以確定德國復文中所顯示之眞確意義、唯多數報紙對英政府以不偏不倚之態度、處理英法宣言中之各種問題、皆一致推崇、蓋此等問題原皆互有連帶關係、不容分割、唯於西門訪柏林一事、則認倫敦態度頗爲慎重、至於蘇俄對於法國所提之照會、此間報紙、尤皆認爲對於和平之一大貢獻、沃佛報以爲英法恊調以及英俄接近之空氣、雖屬良好、然英國將來之態度、至今尚無把握、唯德若不願就範、則英國之態度不出二途、一即英國堅持其英法宣言之立塲、一即使法另尋互助之辦法、若出於前者之一途、則德國地位、自然愈陷困窘、以該報觀察、英國似將採取前一途徑也、（廿一日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英法兩國倫敦宣言一事、據蘇俄方面半官式報告、英國閣員前往柏林之後、最好前往莫斯科、甚或前往華沙一行、此間消息靈通人士、以爲莫斯科方面若果向英政府正式邀請、則英國必當明白表示贊成、至英國閣員前往華沙一層、截至目下爲止、尚未接獲何項消息、此外關於蘇俄與歡英法兩國之照會、應否答復一層、倫敦方面認爲當與巴黎共同商定、爲認爲當予答復、則當商定是否共同答復、抑或分别答復、要之昨日蘇俄駐英法兩國大使分致各該國政府之照會、極爲此間消息靈通人士所歡迎云、（廿一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法觀點相同</h3>
<p>［巴黎］本日英國内閣决定、二月三日英法宣言書中所建議各項、係有密切之關連、如英德談話僅就各項建議中、選定一項加以討論、則殊屬毫無意義、法國政界人士聞英國此項决定、甚爲滿意、以爲英國内閣此種解釋、與法國觀點完全一致、英法兩國政府現將就平常外交途徑、作密切之聯絡、英國外相西門於二月二十八日來巴黎之一事、尤關特别重要、此外政界方面注意集中於對德國之覆文、蓋上次德國答覆英法政府之照會、對於多瑙河公約東歐互助公約及德國重返國聯會各節、均未置覆、英國政府致德國之覆文勢必加以追詢、以謀確定德國對於此等問題之態度云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英關切者兩事</h3>
<p>［倫敦］關於二月三日英法宣言書所引起之問題、外傳英國政府曾向蘇聯駐英大使有所交涉、同時英國駐俄大使亦向蘇聯政府有所磋商、兹據消息靈通方面所稱、此説殊屬不確、查倫敦談話以後、英國駐蘇聯大使雖曾與蘇聯政府交換意見、此則與英國各外交代表向其他各國政府所陳述者相同、僅送遞二月三日之英法宣言書、並加以口頭説明、俾對於此項宣言書之用意、不至有所含混、尤其對於英法所建議各項互相連繫之一層、作詳細之説明、除此以外、英國對於蘇聯政府别無其他交涉也、消息靈通方面復謂、英國對蘇聯之態度、所關切者不外二事、一則英國直接有關者僅在西歐方面、在東歐方面則英國並不担當主要之任務、二則英國欲使莫斯科方面具有一種感覺、以爲英國不特不欲减削俄國之安全地位、且英國勸令德國與其隣國訂結互助公約、其意即在使俄國獲得安全也、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本的經濟策略（大連通信）</h3>
<p>實現日「滿」經濟同盟</p>
<p>形成遠東優越地位</p>
<p>統制日「滿」經濟同盟、已倡過很久了、但並不曾完全實現、原因是東北四省境内秩序還没有恢復、經濟的建設、當然不能進入正軌、同時日本國内也還有種種未解决的問題、關於東北境内的秩序、到還無所謂、祇要沿鐵道各區能保持着平常的狀况、也就可以敷衍下去、不怕發生其他的麻煩、而日本國内、社會的經濟的矛盾、影響到東北四省還小、惟有他政治上的文武不恊、差不多會直接反映過來、例如日本資本家近三年來總算遇着黄金時代了、但對東北四省的投資、這幾年來爲數總計不過三億五千萬日金哩、（這還是公稱資本額、其實數尚不及此）、</p>
<p>這個數目、和三年半以來的軍費相較、恐怕不及二分之一、那麽他們爲什麽不肯投資呢、就爲的是軍部勢力高漲、尤其是在關東軍所轄區域、他們更是胸懷疑懼、怕一旦有什麽事故發生、他們的財産得不到政治上的確實保障、所以總是躊躇、輕易不敢向東四省投資、祇盡力擴展其輸出入貿易、</p>
<p>關東軍的統制方法、由三位一體改作軍部與外務省兩位一體之後、資本家的權力、更小到要聽命於軍司令官了、他們雖然很不滿意、但亦無可如何、現在統制經濟、日「滿」共存共榮、那是軍部指揮的統制經濟、軍刀底下的共存共榮、我們看今年三月間要實施的日「滿」經濟共同委員會條約大綱、就曉得其内容何如、</p>
<p>『一　日本國政府及「滿洲國」政府爲確保兩國間産業經濟統制之强化、認識調和兩國經濟分野之統制、及其特異性起見、以不惹起對手國企業組織之急激變動爲前提、以共同確立國家本位政策爲目的、乃設立日「滿」經濟共同委員會於長春、</p>
<p>『二　共同委員會之構成、以日本人三人「滿洲」人三名合計六名組織之、（日本方面爲關東軍參謀長·關東局總長·大使館參事官·「滿洲」方面爲總務廳長·實業部大臣·財政部大臣·）委員會之下、由日「滿」兩政府任命同數目之幹事、</p>
<p>『三　爲處理經濟共同委員會事務、在該委員會所在地設立事務局、</p>
<p>『四　日「滿」兩國政府將「滿洲」關東州（即遼理半島區域）租借地、凡與兩國有關之共同經濟事項、均付該委員會審議、其他如日「滿」經濟提携方策之審議·建議·調查·報告等項、均由該委員會處理之、</p>
<p>『五　日「滿」經濟共同委員會權限之規定、該委員會之委員·幹事·以及顧問等、是否由民間有識者參加、目前雖未决定、但該委員會之權限、凡關於「滿洲國」經濟的開發、關東軍司令部有指導權、以上兩者之權限、所採取之方針、在調停日「滿」兩國經濟統制上凡研究調查、交換意見、審議諮詢等各機能、該委員會係兼備之機關』、</p>
<p>由以上五項組織大綱、就充分看出所謂日「滿」經濟同盟的内容、並且它在第五項中已明白指出該經濟共同委員會須受關東軍的指導、換言之、即由關東軍支配、這不特當地人民無法參加、即日本國内的資本家也不能不聽從軍部的領導、而且它還預備更進一步『促進「滿」支經濟關係』、擴大關東軍的權力、形成遠東的經濟同盟、這種企圖、在歐美諸國的運用、完全是用經濟力來支配、總以金融資本及工商業資本作中心、日本所用的方法、就大不相同、是以軍部作中心、凡百都用軍力來解决、（二月十二日於大連）</p>

<h3>張彭春從三個觀點談中國戲劇</h3>
<p>——今後努力方向如下——</p>
<p>（一）應有分析與紀載</p>
<p>（二）修改劇本及演作</p>
<p>（三）應更有新的創造</p>
<p>南開大學教授張彭春博士、此次偕同梅蘭芳赴俄、恊助一切、張氏研究戲劇有素、昨與記者暢談中國戲問題、據張云氏、我們對於中國戲、我想可以從三個觀點上來看、第一是從社會地位上看、第二是從戲劇藝術上看、第三是從文化變遷上看、（一）從社會地位上看中國戲、我們對於中國戲的看法向來是輕視的、以爲只是一種娱樂品、對戲劇有興趣的文人墨客、自從元　到最近的二三十年前、也不過認劇本是一種游戲文章、戲劇在歐洲比較的　運多了、從希臘時期到現代、雖然中間有幾百年像似無聲無色、可是戲劇早就被承認爲文學正宗的一派、中國戲既然被士大夫們輕視、所以在社會的地位、亦像似很低、一直到現在我恐怕在我們　意議　還免不了有輕看中國　和與戲有關係的人的舊觀念、道是不　　　的、但是近來因爲西方對於戲劇的看法漸漸傳到中國來、所以大家對於戲劇、亦知道要研究、要創造、戲劇在社會上的地位亦就提高了、（二）從戲劇藝術上看中國戲、中國戲與西洋劇不同、既不是話劇、亦不是歌劇、中國戲組織法是不同的、在文字方面、中國的戲本是歌曲與念白混合而成的、並且不是完全的代語體、—例如四郎探母坐宫的一段裏扮楊延輝的人自己唱「楊延輝坐宫院…」這種例子、非常之多、上面説的是中國戲的文字方面、以下再要説到表演方面、如果我們用近代寫實劇的眼光來看、很容易看中國戲爲一種進化不完備的社會遺産、但是中國戲與普通一般的近代寫實劇的區别、在根本承認「藝術」與「日常形式」之間的距離、例如舞台的唱白與日常的語言不同、舞台的身段與日常的行動不同、舞台的扮像與日常的容貌不同、舞台的行頭與日常的服裝不同等等、在現代也有人對寫實派的藝術不滿、想要創造一種藝術的方式、脱離日常形式的捆綁、但是這一般新藝術的方法與中國戲的方法、又有不同之點、他們是想用個人的神感創造一種特殊的方式、他們的創造自然與日常形式是有距離的、但是很難得到别人的領略、中國藝術的方法、根據相傳的習慣、漸漸的形成一種藝術的「字母」、譬如各種的身段、都是可以分析爲許多簡單的動作、這些簡單的動作、就是身段的「字母」、這些「字母」因爲是相傳下來的、所以可以得到觀衆的領略、雖然台步與尋常的走路不同、但是觀衆可以懂得、台上的走路就應該如此、所以中國的戲一方面脱離日常形式的捆綁、在另一方面可以得到觀衆的領略、這就是中國戲與近代寫實派的戲不同之點、也就是中國戲與「個人創造藝術方式的戲」不同之點、既然各種方式是相傳的習慣、但是如何可以看得出個人的特長、或者是個人的創造呢、總起來可以分爲三點、（一）每種方式的深刻了解、與入神的運用、（二）在全部方式的聯合統一的精神、（三）在曾經熟練舊方式以後、而感有新方式創造之需要、而後創造之、新創造　方式如經過同行人與觀衆的承受、即認爲可傳授的方式、上次中國戲在美國表演、所以能受一般研究戲劇人的好評、大約就在上述中國戲的特色、三年前、我到蘇聯、參觀教育與戲劇、得機會與蘇聯導演家麥爾厚德談到他訓練演員的一種方法、他叫這種方法爲「生物機械學」Bio-Mehanics、他的意思是訓練演員各種動作使情感與身段有密切的聯絡、他説「這種的方法是拿中國戲訓練演員的方法、作參攷而産生的」、從经可以見得俄國導演家、已經對於中國戲有相當的認識、（三）從文化變遷上看中國戲、無論那一國或那一時代的文化方式、如有可注意或可供參攷之點、就應當研究與保存、不過我們不能説這種成績、就可以長時間的存在不變、因爲一個地方或一個時候的文化産物、一定要隨「文化氣候」變遷而改變、我們應該承認中國戲的範圍是窄狹的、在窄狹範圍之内、我們要使中國戲能繼續適存在世界上、必須始力以下三個方向、（一）製成有系統的分析與詳密的記載、用照像·電影·留聲機·文字·圖案等工具、將已有的身段·唱工·説白·等都做出詳細的分析、與有系統的記載、以備保存與研究、（二）整理與修改劇本及演作法、劇情必須深刻化、音樂必須有凖確的安排、身段必須有一定的地位與尺寸、（三）新創造根據本身的特色、利用世界藝術與科學、創造新的劇本、新的音樂、新的身段、新的化裝、新的佈景、—非寫實的、要風格化的、—如此做去、中國戲在現代世界上可以佔有相當的地位、</p>

<h3>鑽石别鎮離奇竊案</h3>
<p>大家閨秀衣飾摩登不類胠篋者流</p>
<p>缷下大衣發現别針豈可質入當鋪</p>
<p>安徽女子龐正龍、年方雙十、體質壯健、宛似偉男子、曾在安徽高等師範肄業、現寓法租界姚主教路樹德坊十五號、上月二十八日午後五時三刻、該女獨至南京路五百九十八號上海舊貨商店、聲言欲購項圈、店中執事見甚服飾摩登、認爲大家閨秀、隨即殷懃招待、一面於櫝中出項圈、與其選擇、女則缷其黑大衣、置諸櫝畔、以頸項圈、以手撫弄、以口論價、良久仍嫌值昂、還圈取衣、掉首而去、是晚該店檢點櫝中諸飾、發覺内置價值二百二十元之</p>
<p>鑽石别針</p>
<p>一支、已不翼而飛、以女嘗置大衣於櫝畔、心疑或係女爲、爰投老閘捕房報告、因不知女之踪跡、致無法查究、前日下午五時許、該女又赴上海舊發商店、惟服飾更覺麗都、衣綠呢西式大衣、紅色西式短裙、黄色絲襪、黄革履、益令人注目、該店執事見其翩然戾止、雖舊日疑雲、重佈心頭、然以未有佐證、不便向之請問、依然殷懃週旋、迨女既去立派一夥友尾之、直隨至法租界霞飛路九百三十六號</p>
<p>鴻甡當舖</p>
<p>女入舖内、探囊出質劵一紙、該當鋪夥以爲係贖物者、審視質劵後、即取出鑽石别針一支、當據女稱、並非取贖、係欲增質、舖夥估量之下、以前次已質一百五十元、今祇能加質二十六元、詢女願否、女則首肯、此際隨往之上海舊貨商店夥友已辨明别針確爲原物、當向附近用電話報由老閘捕房派探目王善卿馳往該當舖查拿、而女已查如黄鶴、王探目乃轉報法捕房、加派探員恊緝、至六時半、始悉女取得質欵後回歸寓所、</p>
<p>偕兩青年</p>
<p>男性赴台斯德朗路二百零六號匯芳食物公司同餐果腹、比即踵去、一併拿獲、帶回捕房、經捕頭詰問一、過兩男性一名張官錦、一名農密南、均供在大學肄業、而女加質之欵、亦在張身畔搜出、所質别針、旋亦原贓吊到、當時龐女自承竊飾典質不諱、並謂因與張農等皆曾同學、且負張債、故質欵償宿逋、此外並無關係、捕頭遂將張農</p>
<p>兩人摘釋</p>

<p>項圈出售</p>
<p>故入店視察、旋以囊無多金、致未購妥、及回抵寓所、缷下所服大衣、則見有别針一支、綴於衣内、頓憶及在該商店時曾置衣於飾匣、此針或即匣中物、本擬立即送還、因有摯友王雨豐臥病大華醫院、屢次告貸醫藥費、均以無欵未應、既得此别針、遂持往醫院、以濟人急、初未將針之來歷告友、王亦欣然領受、更央爲其變資、遂向當舖質得一百五十元與之、但伊乃一有智識之女子、原不應當此不名譽行爲、事後思量、</p>
<p>倍加心痛</p>
<p>屢欲往該商店説明、均以無此勇氣、以致欲行又止、昨日、再度往該商店原擬自行舉發、請該店稍寛時日、籌資償還、不料到後、因店中人招待殊殷、遂仍難於啓齒、廢然而返、途中憶及所欠張官錦四十元、張將於今日離滬、曾來</p>
<p>索逋之事</p>
<p>乃復往當舖加當所得之欵、已以二十元還張債矣、供畢、欷歔不置、詹推事因被告尚係初犯從寛、供畢、欷歔不置、詹推事因被告尚係初犯從寛、判科罰金五十元、原贓交失主領去、當本仰被告速自歸還、龐女被科罰後、其男性之友、則候於法庭門外、及見女出、即趨前慰藉、而女猶揮淚痛哭不已、斯誠鮮有之案也、</p>

<h3>潘公展演講上海的學校教育（四）</h3>
<p>（二）我們不僅希望學齡的兒童都有進小學的機會、並且我們要想法使一班不識字的成年人也得受教育機會、這種「成人教育」在外國是叫「成年教育」、所謂「成年教育」、在外國是爲一班年長的人因没有專門學問而予以補習專門學問的教育、這些人在幼年都已受過小學教育、他們説年長失學、决不像我國人到年長了連文字都没有識、或許有幾個國家也有年長不識字的人、但恐這樣的人總是少數、我們對於我國一般年長不識字的人、總應想法呌他們識一點文字、甚至就是使他們識幾個字也比不識宇强、我們把這種教育通常叫做「民衆教育」、但照我想起來、「民衆教育」四字、有些不大妥當、爲什麽呢、既稱「民衆教育」、則所有的一切民衆、都應該包含在内、就「民衆」説、不僅年長而没有識字的人是民衆、小學生也是民衆、中學生也是民衆、大學生也是民衆、所有一切教育、都是民衆來受、實實在在講起來、還是應該叫「成人教育」、不過這個名稱、暫時且不必去管牠、就是沿用「民衆教育」、亦無不可、不過應該分爲成人部與兒童部、把不識字的成人和兒童做對象、上海的「成人教育」即「民衆教育」情形究竟這樣呢、我可以把他簡單報告一下、上海市私人設立的「民衆學校」、我不去説他、市立的「民衆學校」、現已辦過十三届、每届四個月畢業、這樣接連辦過十三次、在第一届時計辦有二十個學校、第二届時辦有三十個學校、第三届時辦有三十三個學校、第四届時立有三十五個學校、第五届時辦有五十二個學校、第六届時辦有五十二個學校、第七届時辦有五十四個學校、第八届時辦有三十五個學校、第九届時辦有四十三個學校、第十届時辦有四十六個學校、第十一届時辦有五十一個學校、第十二届時辦有五十個學校、第十二届的學校、要到民國二十四年一月才畢業、第十三届辦了十五個「高等民衆學校」、這班學生要到民國二十四年三月才畢業、除第十三届的學生數目没有統計外、以前十二届學生、男男女女合併起來的總數、是二萬三千三百三十六人、因爲「民衆學校」的書本等用品都是送給學生的、他們每每讀不到多日就不來了、所以有些學生没到畢業就已不來學校、因此、在十二届中讀完四個月等到畢業的學生數目、祇有一萬零一百二十六人、平均每届不及一千人、截至十一届止、「民衆學校」用去的經費、計用五萬二千零十三元、平均每届約五千元、即每畢業生一人需費五元、辦「民衆學校」所用的經費、若與小學校比、那是省得多了、而且我們做推廣「民衆教育」事業的經費、大都是由辦中小學教育費多餘的錢去辦的、所以實際並没有多少專欵來作推廣「民衆教育」事業的經費、總而言之、我們對於一般年長不識字的人、要使他們識得一點粗淺文字、知道一點普通常識、這是每一個人最低限度所應當曉得的一些簡單知識、不過如果照以往辦民衆學校的進步比例推算、要使上海成年文盲一百萬人（約數）都受識字教育、須再辦一千届民衆學校、以每届四個月計、須經過四千個月、即等於三百多年、就經費而論、每個民衆學校的畢業生需費公欵五元、則此一百萬文盲的識字經費竟要達五百萬元、豈非駭人聽聞、可見用這種辦民衆教育的老方法來辦普及教育、實在足以笑痛肚皮、我們總得爲這個窮中國窮上海另想别法、</p>
<p>原來「初等教育」、注意在教授兒童以粗淺文字和普通常識、「民衆教育」所注意的、也在於教授成年人以粗淺文字和普通常識、所以這兩種學校應該互相聯絡、而我們今後的辦法、就要拿大中小學校來做推動「民衆教育」的基礎、所有中小學教師、應該大家來做推廣「民衆教育」的工作、同時、我們還要提倡大學生中學生及年齡較大的小學生同來做這種工作、除了自己讀書以外、應該拿出一點工夫來教不識字的文盲、這樣、一方面學、一方面教、不但對於自己學業要有長進、同時、也是報答社會的一種服務、假如我們把全市學生看一看、小學生現有十五萬幾千人、在十個小學生中找一個年齡較大的、就有一萬五千人、再加上三萬二千中學生、一萬二千大學生、如果合起來、就有五萬九千人、差不多將近六萬人、再加上各級學校教職員約一萬二千人、假如這六萬學生、一萬二千教職員、大家發個志願、在這一學期内、每個人擔任教三個「文盲」識字、不論教鄉下人也好、教家中老媽子也好、凡是不識字的人、都可以教、這樣半年以後、七萬二千人就可教了二十一萬人、掃除二十一萬「文盲、這决不是痴心妄想、現在我們吃虧的、就是因爲没有做、假如我們大家拿出决心來做、在每星期中抽出幾小時來、或是在每天抽出一些時間來做這件事、並不是什麽煩難工作、這不是「挾泰山以超北海」做不到的事情、大家不做、是不爲也、非不能也、假使我們能够照這樣算法去做呢、半年教了二十一萬人、一年就可教到四十萬人、自然用不了兩三年、就可把上海所有「文盲」除盡、而且我們還得有個方法、不管對男男女女老老小小、凡教了一個識字的人、就同他訂一個約、我們教你、不要你的錢、你也要發個志願、等你認識字後、將來自願担任教一二個不識字的人、這樣一來、在上學期教了二十一萬人、等到下學期、不止再教二十一萬人、因爲上學期新識字的二十一萬人每人如果也去再教一人、豈不是下學期可以教成四十萬人嗎、如此做去、一定可以掃除「文盲」、不過這個辦法、要望大家盡力提倡、大家來「身體力行」、不要認爲空想、就是没有做得完全成功、也不要緊、總比不做好、如再把自己想一想、我總是受父母師長教大的、我現今盡點義務來教三個人識字、也算報答報答社會、而且幾本千字課、也值不了多少錢、就是我買三份送送學生也十分要緊、我們中國是一「窮國」、所以我們要打「窮算盤」、世上窮的人、當眞就不做事了嗎、我們要講效率、要用費少、而事情做得成效大、我很誠懇的希望已經受過教育的人以及還在學校讀書的學生、不論大小、都能發個志願、貢獻你們的力量到「成人教育」方面去、並且頂好就起來做、不要期待、以爲今日不做、還有明日、到了來年一月一日、以爲還有三百六十五日、這樣「以待來年」、是待不了的、而且世界風雲轉變不測、我們不能等待、也不容我們等待的呀、</p>
<p>也許有人要問、你今天演講的東西、都是淺薄得很、不過希望小孩子知道一點粗淺常諭、年長文盲識得幾個文字、這有什麽多大用處呢、人家會發明飛機、駕駛飛機、人家會發明毒氣、製造槍砲、所謂「堅甲利兵」、假使我們不注意到這些問題、不是依然吃虧嗎、因此、就有「問題」來了、有人説、「專門教育」最重要、而把「小學教育」和「成人教育」都歸到「普及教育」方面去、於是中國在過去就有了兩派主張、照我剛才所説、我好像是站在「普及教育」的陣綫、還有不少的名流學者、他們似乎瞧不起「普及教育」、以爲「專門人才」重要、但我的意思、並不是不要「專門人才」、不過在這個時期、「普及教育」實在格外重要、這是從比較來説的、記得由清末到民國初年、這兩派意見、爭論得很多、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （蕉心）</p>
<p>每在天將釀雪的夜裏，酒徒們總想邀二三知己，喝上幾杯，白香山的「晚來天欲雪，能飲一杯無？」確爲傳神之筆；可是不喝酒的人，是體味不出它的妙處來的。</p>
<p>女人總想把伊的丈夫管得服服貼貼，唯閫命是從；可是伊却絶對不願伊的兒子聽信媳婦。女人總説媳婦怎樣怎樣的不好，但是伊的女兒是無論如何都是好的；萬一嫁了不幸而婆媳間不睦，那當然是婆婆的不是。所以女人的心理是極端矛盾的。</p>
<h3>囹圄</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>腿際的創痕漸深，鐵鐐的縛束加緊；背脊的創痕增多，皮鞭的接觸漸勤；</p>
<p>汗珠洗白頭頂的長髮，鬍鬚生滿在枯黄的臉上，外面雖然有一個自由的世界—但祇是隔着一層牢固的鐵窗。</p>
<p>這首小詩是我從前哀歌囚徒的，人不幸陷入囹圄，人的幸福便完全被剥奪了！</p>
<p>可是鐵窗裏面的生活雖然悲慘，鐵窗外面的世界就能算是自由的嗎？比較起來，没有鐵鐐的縛束，没有皮鞭的鞭打；然而一條一條無形的沉重的鐵鐐，一根一根無形的毒辣的皮鞭，却滿佈在這動亂的現時代當中，毫不容情的向着全人類襲擊呢。</p>
<p>你看：那些爲經濟而自殺的人們，不是犧牲在金錢的囹圄裏面嗎？那些爲婚姻而輕生的人們，不是毁滅在戀愛的囹圄裏面嗎？那些爲迷信而厭世的人們，不是斷送在宗教的囹圄裏面嗎？……人們傾跌，挨痛，慘號，挣扎，在各種不同的囹圄裏面；於是有形的囹圄與無形的囹圄，當中所隔的界限便很微了！</p>
<p>處在這廣大的囹圄裏面的囚徒呵！且集中整個的熱血和雄心，創造出一個眞正自由而美滿的新世界來。</p>
<h3>麻花雋語</h3>
<p>— 彦和</p>
<p>前讀王莎葩君油條小語，「謂偶在收音機中，聽到某滑稽家唱什麽大餅油條歌：大餅油條，大餅油條，吹麥花，吹麥花，……」云云。查此歌乃民國十六年，北伐軍抵滬以後，大唱其「打倒列强，打倒列强，鋤軍閥，鋤軍閥，國民革命成功，國民革命成功，齊歡唱！齊歡唱！」之歌。當時即有人仿照此歌，另作「大餅油條，大餅油條，脆麻花，脆麻花，三個銅一隻，三個銅板一隻，賤不賤？賤不賤？」此兩歌者，均曾膾炙一時人口，下里巴人，咸能演唱。初不待「某滑稽家，」始能「别開生面」也。</p>
<p>吹麥花三字，實杜撰之尤者，將引杜子美詩，「細麥落輕花」，抑引段懋堂説，「江以北，麥以畫花，陽物也，故食之體健：江以南，麥夜作花，陰物也，故多食損人。」以爲麥花之根據耶？然吹字又作何解？無疑的，這便是馬路上小販呌賣之「麻油饊子」「脆麻花」了。</p>
<p>麻花，亦有稱之爲高麗棒者，此等名稱，但見俗語，書籍中殊少根據，鄉間婦女，髮髻上插一銀針，針上盤旋作麻花狀，是名麻花針，又有臂戴銀鐲，盤旋作麻花形，亦名麻花鐲。至於脆麻花之脆字，乃賣者之形容詞。</p>
<p>昔人有仿人面桃花詩，以詠麻花者云：「去年今日此門過，麻面麻花相對搓，麻面不知何處去，麻花依舊下油鍋。」眞令人忍雋不禁。</p>
<p>又考閩雜記云：「閩人所稱油粿，杭州之油灼膾也，福州人亦稱油灼粿，興化人但稱灼粿。」按此即普通所稱之油炸膾云。</p>

<h3>上海乞丐生活速寫</h3>
<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>乞丐在上海，非但不見减少，而且一天天的在增加起來；這或許是他們生活寫意的緣故吧？</p>
<p>的確，天是他們的被，地是他們的牀，將身一横，黄粱一夢，酣暢無比，俗語説得好：「討飯三年，不願做官。」乞丐寫意的生活，可謂形容殆盡了！</p>
<p>乞丐在這寒風料峭的時節，再也不高興裹了麻袋筋，擁着亂茅草，破紙頭，睏在小弄堂裏的跨街樓下同寒友們吃着西北風了，因爲他們每天的收入終要二三千文左右，所以他們也會借客棧去了；這些客棧都集中在法租界一帶，像公館馬路的後面，八仙橋之北，東新橋，以及老北門等地方，都有專做乞丐生意的客棧存在的？這些客棧的房間，並不像大旅館的房間，有水汀，沙發，檯凳，……設備完全，他們都是一格一格的房間，只够一個人睡的地方，普通呌做「鴿子籠，」這種「鴿子籠」式的房間，每一宿的價錢，大概自銅元十多枚起至三十多枚不等；有幾個老槍在夜裏竟然抽抽鴉片，打打撲克，肚皮饑餓時，呌幾客蛋炒飯來吃吃，這是他們平常的事，不足爲奇。</p>
<p>到了天明的時候，一般老槍乞丐，手指中夾了香烟屁股，隨走隨吸的向走路人求乞，他們往往還要呌着「趕着猪玀」，這豈不是别開生面？還有討各路人家的乞丐，倘使看見人家大門一開，他們便光臨了，口裏還要説着：「好久不來了！」這大概是客氣的意思吧？</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咜未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>最後小脚女人，這四個字，算是清清楚楚的，送到他耳朶裏去了，他這就禁不住不插嘴了，笑道：那要什麽緊呀？我們雖是小脚，什麽事也能做。我要是跪在地上做事，你大脚女人，還不如我做的多呢。那女人由東方來，是飽受着文明教化的人，人家不稱呼他太太，也稱呼他先生或女士，向來没有人和他説話，就是你們我們這樣喊呌的。立刻滿臉通紅，向門外揮手道：去去！什麽規矩也不懂那個用你這種東西。去去！説畢，又連連的揮了兩下手。胡氏雖不懂他的話，去去這兩個疊起總是聽得出來的，既然呌去去，原説是可以給事做的這句話，那就不行了。滿腔的指望，總以爲見了主人翁，就可以有了吃飽飯的機會，不想那個像洋婆子的女人，脾氣倒是很大，三言兩語的就紅了臉。這倒不知是那一些事，他看不入眼，而作工的機會呢，也不顧立刻就失掉，因道：喲！不是你要我們帮工嗎？他口裏説着這話時，心裏也有些慌了。當然那兩隻脚站立不定，身子又前後的幌盪起來。那女人又揮着手道：滚罷，那個要你這種廢物作工？程志前當這女人初發脾氣時，心裏也不怎樣的介意。現在他又呌着人滚，雖然這貧寒女子，是不能怎樣抵抗的，然而他這種不客氣的樣子，便是介紹人，也有點面子上摸不下來，於是也紅着臉向月英道：你母親也太不會説話，張口就得不着人的歡迎。這扶着母親回去罷。（一三九）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>又喜當我們未來之前，先來收拾的人也已注意到這一座戲臺，所以臺上的幾根柱子，早就重新漆過，那些彫在柱上的飛龍，也一律加敷了一重金顔色，黄澄澄地耀得好生奪目；此刻再掛上了幾幅繡花的錦幔，頓覺面目一新。好比一個鄉下老頭兒換上了一套時新的袍褂，他原有的一般寒酸愚蠢的土相兒雖不能完全掩過，但至少是不會再如何觸目的了！太后也點頭微笑，表示這座戲臺尚可用得。那末我們的戲不是就可開鑼了嗎？却還不能咧！要開鑼是必須由太后自己吩咐下去的，誰也不敢擅動；而此刻的太后，還正在很有興地給我們講着楊四郎怎樣失落在番邦，怎樣和鐵鏡公主成婚，後來怎樣思親，公主又怎樣給他盗令，他怎樣進關……等一切詳細的節目，伊决不肯讓我們聽了一半便停止，於是戲就擱下來了。一直待伊講到楊四郎怎樣回去太遲，以致給蕭太后知道，險些要把他斬首，幸得公主力救才免，這一段故事方始完畢。</p>
<p>待伊的話匣子一停，大家都知道戲是快要開演了；伊也不用説什麽話，只把手一擺，旁邊的太監就飛一般的奔近戲臺邊去，高聲呌道：「老佛爺有旨，吩咐開鑼」！臺上便霎時間金鼓大作，一幕一幕地演出來了。在演戲的時候，太后還不肯安靜，儘是絮絮不休的把戲劇上的各種習慣和軼事説給我們聽。其實伊也是因爲看戲看得太多的緣故，再也無心安坐靜觀了。（二五○）</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>日本上野動物園一瞥（上）</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>上野公園裏的動物園，在日本規模最大，不但在日本，或者也是東亞最大的一個。門票一角五分，便可遊玩整天，把金世界的動物，都可以展覽到了</p>
<p>走獸的一部份裏，有水牛，駱駝，騾，馬等。内中有一匹褐色的坐騎，旁邊説明，牠曾經到過奉天哈爾濱内蒙古，加入競賽，行過一千八百多里路。狐狸狼熊等，比較兇猛，都用鐵籠圍住。各種獐鹿羊猪不過用鐵的短闌干圍着罷了。</p>
<p>兩隻印度灰象，是動物園中最大的角色，住所佔居了一間很大的洋房。白天還可以到旁邊的空塲裏散步。象牙是没有了，它時常把很長的鼻子，伸出鐵籠子外面，向觀衆索取食物。在每一種動物的面前，都有一隻木箱，裏面放着一盆盆的食物，像山芋蘿葡之類。箱蓋上寫着每盆一錢。就有許多兒童，把食物丢給動物吃。旁邊雖然没有人監督着，他們也能好好的把錢放在小櫃裏。</p>
<p>上野公園裏很少天然的石頭，但是獸類很喜歡過山野生活。他們便用人造石來佈置成爲高山峻嶺，和我國的假山一樣，頗能亂眞。數十隻猴所住的山洞，有三四丈高的山峰，自來水的瀑布淙淙的流着，竟像西遊記裏的花果山了</p>
<p>白熊和海豹海狗是北冰洋的動物，所以旁邊都有海水的池子，使它們生活可以安適。河馬是住在室内的游泳池裏，旁邊有熟水汀供給暖氣。因爲近幾天天氣很冷，所以兩隻河馬老是匿在水底，隔二三十分鐘，才要把鼻孔露出水面，換一次空氣。</p>
<p>各種奇異的飛禽，都分别用鐵絲籠分隔着，有二三丈高，裏面有常綠的樹木可以棲息，毫無不自由的狀態。凡是喜水的飛禽都有小池子，可以遊泳，所以羽毛很清潔光亮。但是有幾頭白雀和青鸞，尾毛都染了污泥，而且折斷得剩了没有幾根了。</p>
<p>最難飼養的當然是熱帶動物。日本氣候比我國上海寒冷，於是他們又不惜功夫，造着暖房用水汀供給熱源。各種美麗的小鳥，便佔據了一大間。魚類的飼養方法，很特别的。用玻璃造成匣子，使盛水不漏。匣子底上舖着細沙小石子，和生着青苔的石塊，旁邊又種植着海底水草，於是各種的魚類，就能很安適的生活了。玻璃匣子是砌在牆壁裏的，由上面放光下來，觀者就可很清晰的看見魚兒在海草裏穿來穿去的游泳着。他們還利用機械的奇巧，使匣裏的水，時刻在流動着，而水的容量並不會過多過少。</p>

<h3>人間諸態</h3>
<p>— 白苧</p>
<p>所謂假面也者，約而分之，可有二種。</p>
<p>蕭伯納在一個劇本裏借一個石頭人的口説出那諷喻當世的話：「在英國每個音樂會裏，你可看到無數排的厭倦的人，他們在那裏不是因爲眞的喜歡古典曲，不過因爲他們想他們應當喜歡牠。在天國裏也有同樣的事，要多人榮耀地坐在那裏不是因爲他們快樂，不過因爲覺得爲體面計，他們不得不坐在那裏，他們幾乎全是英國人」。這機智的話，眞給當世一班虚僞矜持的人們一個當頭棒喝。在我們的生活中，這樣的人不知可遇到多少。他們戴着假面，用誑語和遁辭來築成自己的堡壘。他們未嘗不知道那是假的，但爲維持自己的身分和利害計，不得不屈服於這假面之下，走向墳墓裏去。彬彬有禮的周旋，莊重安詳的丰度，這裏面就許埋伏着世間最卑污的欺詐。「主者曰進，則再拜故遲不起，起則上所上壽金，主者故不受，則固請，主者故固不受，則又固請，然後命吏納之，則又再拜，又故遲不起，起則五六揖始出」。這賓主間揖讓進退的行爲，簡直搆成了一齣絶妙的「人間喜劇」。此外如情侣相逢，卿卿我我，見面時來説一套：「我如何能離開你」！這都未免太像做戲，我們如果靜下來細想一下時，是禁不住要啞然失笑的。</p>
<p>但所謂假面者，除此之外，還有取看另一種姿態出現於人間生活中的，這不是那士君子風度的撑柱，而是無情生活鞭撻下不得不爾的矯飾。酒店裏的女侍，舞塲内的舞姬，風塵中的娼妓，窺伺个峰顔色的小職員，囊空如洗强撑門面的破落户，强顔歡笑的商人，雖則他們生活中如充滿了無數膿血交流的瘡瘢，然而爲了還得生活，他們也不得不有他們的假面。他們得有逢人就要開口笑；得有媚人的眼波，得有維恭維謹的禮貌，這不過都是他們生活浮面上膚淺的現象，若一深掘到那根柢時，纔知道這一切都是假的，正如廢墟上幾莖鮮艶的花草，死人靈柩邊一兩聲悦耳的音樂，這俯仰異趣哀樂由人的處世藝術中，真埋藏着深郁無比的人間味。如其你不是一個淺薄的觀察者，你就會從那惟恐不得别人垂青的陪笑中，惟恐抓不住對方的媚笑中，惟恐被人看出弱點的強笑中，讀出了壓榨在生活重磨下的血淚糢糊的心之哀訴。這窮裏尋歡淚中求笑的心境，不久便化為整個的麻痺，乃至蒙着假面而不自覺，茫然地如幽靈般地移動着。在俄國小說中常能看到這樣的人物，如安特列夫題名為笑的一個短篇裏，寫一人穿戴滑稽的假面到跳舞會去會那遺棄他的愛人，他說：「我無論走到那裏，一陣喧笑圍繞着我，牠和我在一處，我逃不出這狂歡的圈子……但在這假面下的我是多麽孤單」！後來離開會塲走到大街，那朋友在誇奬他有趣的時候看到他抓破了面具，纔恍然大悟地説：「憑着上帝，他原來是在哭着呢」！不錯，他一直就在哭着的。</p>
<p>這兩種假面雖然不同，但都是這畸形社會所造成的畸形人物，什麽時候人們把假面摔到垃圾堆裏，什麽時候人們就可過着較好的生活了呢？</p>
<h3>科學小品文底内容和形式</h3>
<p>— 任白戈</p>
<p>文學和科學，一向是有一個嚴密的界限的。依照過去一般學者底分類，都以爲學是具象的描寫，着重在感性，科學是抽象的説明，着重在理智，於是無論在形式上或内容上都將它們截然分開。現在，我們一旦要將它們好好地統一起來，自然不免有許多困難，然而單就已有的一點嘗試來說，却也並不是其中完全没有可取的，只要我們底作家們肯好好地努力，當然會得着美滿的結果。這里，便要一吓談到我們底作家們底修養的問題了。</p>
<p>過去的作家們，爲了文學和科學有一個嚴密的界限，大都只能作一方面的作家或學者。文學家往往缺乏科學的頭腦，科學家往往缺乏文學的手腕，就像Ｇ，Ｈ，威爾斯那樣一個以文學的體裁和筆調寫出許多歷史的和科學的故事的作家也不可多得。所以，要找一個眞正兼有科學的頭腦和文學的手腕的作家實在是非常的困難，自然所謂科學小品文便不容易産生了。到了最近，一方面由於新的文學理論底成長，一個文學家不管是在批評上或創作上都得有科學的見地，一方面由於文學作品比較容易接近大衆，一般接近大衆的科學家便不得不應用文學的形式來將科學介紹給大衆，於是文學和科學也就有了一個統一的可能了。科學小品文在這時産生並不是偶然。要寫出好的科學小品文，不待說先决的條件，必是一個真正兼有科學的頭腦和文學的手腕的人，我們底常寫科學小品文的作家們不是應該特别注意於這樣的修養嗎？</p>
<p>到底又應該怎樣修養呢？在客觀上，所謂科學小品文既然是科學和文學底統一，這在主觀上便應該是一種綜合的研究和學習。科學離不了法則底說明，文學離不了典型底描寫，而且這還是很主要的，所謂綜合的研究和學習，就在使作家修養成一種以科學底豐富的知識和文學底熟練的技巧將每一件事物法則地　，典型地説明，描寫出來的能力。只要有了道種能力，我相信所產生出來的科學小品文一定是比較可觀的。直切地說，這就是要求我們底作家們在一種統一中同時兼有科學的修養和文學的修養，而且將這兩種修養統一起來。至於科學的修養和文學的修養是怎樣的，那是用不着再説了。</p>
<p>這樣地説，大約還不十分明白吧。在這里，不妨多引一個例子來説一吓。譬如説，像以「螢火蟲」爲題材的這樣的科學小品文究竟要怎樣寫法才對呢？在一個兼有科學的修養和文學的修養的人，他首先就將那在科學上所必要說明的提挈出來，然後再照文學上的方法去描寫。文學上的人物底描寫，主要的是一般之中的典型，除了作為身分底標記和性格式心境底説明之外，一切靜的外表底描寫，都是大可以不可要的。某人底耳朵嘴巴是什麽樣子，某人穿的是什麽樣子的衣服都一絲一毫地描寫出來，這究竟是一般舊小説底作法，那樣的時代早已過去了。將這話具體地應用到科學小品文上來，就是說在寫「螢火蟲」的時候不必費許多筆墨去描寫它那螢火是怎樣怎樣地好看，而主要的是應該從它底發生和發展，形態和特徵及其對於人類社會的關係中描寫出一個螢火蟲的故事。其他可以類推，不知道目前一般常寫科學小品文的作家們同意這個意見不？</p>
<p>單就目前一般作家所寫的科學小品文來說，自然也真如有些人所說的那樣，許多不是好像教科書上的一課便是太把重心移到形式方面去了，而且只注意到自然科學却不注意社會科學也是眞的。為了補救這個缺點，我並不反對有人提出的要寫的一些。但我以為看輕了科學小品文底「文字藝術」及其破除迷信的作用却是並不十分安當的。目前還在一個嘗試的期間，知們對於一般在雜誌上所登載的科學小品文應該有相當的寛容和大量。因為它至少是小品文山無用變成了有用，的確不能不説是一種進步。</p>
<h3>歷史小品脞談（二）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>第一次寫的是范增，以范增被項羽所疏遠，返歸彭城道中發背死的故事爲題材，中心是一個智識分子被劍把遺棄後的暗影，題名亞文，在文藝月刊刊出。現在追想起來，當時太愛拉長篇幅，已不成其爲歷史小品了。後來改變我自己的乎法，以注入新感想爲主，以史事爲解釋某種意識的例證，乃開始寫「耶穌與基督」和「蘇小小與白娘娘」那兩個短篇，那時胸中先對於現實某事件要有所批評，借史事來發揮發揮，偶或能把胸中的沉哀表白出來，但未免有時要歪曲那史事的本相，不能算是正格的歷史小品。有時我自己有深深的感觸，在讀者的眼裏，却當作古老的故事輕鬆地看過了，因此我不想再寫這類託古寄懷的小玩意，立下决心試作正格的歷代小品，彌正平之死便是我的試作。先後寫成的還有葉名琛，劉楨平祝，（見新小説）和焚草之變，（芒種半月刊）那幾個短篇。</p>
<p>剛着筆時，常有一種錯覺以爲非有完整的故事不能寫；後來漸漸明白，故事完整不完整尚在其次，如何把這故事組織過是第一件事。彌衡在後漢書有傳，他恃才傲上，一不容於曹操，二不容於劉表，三不容於黄祖；歷來詠鸚鵡洲的詩，很多責怪曹操和黄祖，説他們不能容納天才。我細看全傳，覺得彌正平之死，並非曹黄忌才乃死於曹操。黄祖的左右之乎，應得以這點意思爲中心來描寫的。在傳文末段，「祖主素簿疾衡，即時殺焉」那兩句話是明白點破這個因由，而上文「操怒，………送與劉表，……臨發，衆人爲之祖道，………咸以不起折之………」「表嘗與諸文人共草草奏，並極其才思，時衡出還見之，開省未周，因毁以抵地，表憮然爲駭；衡乃從求筆札，須臾立成，辭義可觀，表大悦，益重之。」字裏行間卻隱隱有左右懷恨嫉才，帮主子逐客的情勢存在着。我顛倒順序，把這故事重新組織過；以黄射（黄祖子）來陪襯彌衡，以鸚鵡賦來作彌衡的精神告白，以黄祖急性，執法主簿借機報私怨來作這事件的團圜綫索；以史事爲主，不加絲毫歪曲解釋；居然能把新的涵義明顯地傳達出來，我自以爲合乎歷史小品的基本原則了。</p>
<h3>停課</h3>
<p>— 任達泉</p>
<p>拖着憂鬱的步子，王先生走出校長先生的大門，反背着手走向學校去。</p>
<p>心裏怪悶悶的，兩條濃黑的眉毛在蒼白色的瘦臉上緊蹙在一起。腦筋裏空蕩蕩的，只有校長先生那張嘻開没牙齒的扁嘴巴底笑臉。這扁嘴巴裏吐出來的話，這時還在王先生的耳朶裏響着——</p>
<p>『王先生，噯！這實在怪對不起的，…眞的，兄弟抱歉得很！噯！……不過，王先生，這眞没辦法！你想，年成這麽壞，村裏誰家讀得起書呢？噯！……年成好，當不會這樣，噯！……那只好暫時停課，没錢眞没法子，王先生，對不對？我個人當然希望維持下去，然而事實如此，没辦法！噯！……没辦法！……』</p>
<p>跨進學校門檻，王先生才放開反背的手，長長地嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>一聽到先生的聲音，一大羣聚在一簇玩的孩子都『呀』的一聲飛散到自己座位上，眼睛直看着書本，裝做怪注意的樣子，嘴裏吟唸着自己也聽不清楚的書句。</p>
<p>平時王先生准會板起面孔噶着：『又在玩，不用功，等歇背不出書不放學！』或則站在隨便那個孩子面前，用手指在書本上説：『給我讀清楚來，一個一個字讀，這樣嗡嗡的在讀甚麽？』</p>
<p>今天王先生却只朝每個孩子臉上看了一眼，默默的依舊回出校門。</p>
<p>校門前是一大塊葉子密密的桑地，望去一遍碧綠的。</p>
<p>對這一簇一簇綠沉沉的桑葉，王先生記起他來這鄉村小學教書的時候，桑樹還是一根根的光幹子，眞想不到啊！只一學期學校會關門的。雖則教書匠的生涯是怪清苦，一天到晚要指導三四十個頑皮的孩子，不過這一堆赤脚破衣孩子的靈魂是潔白，天眞，他們臉上常有没一絲絲虚僞成份的無邪可愛的微笑，……</p>
<p>可是完了！王先生的心裏給失業咬着悲哀之外，另又重重的加上一陣悵惘。</p>
<p>一陣孩子尖鋭起勁的囂呌聲，把王先生呌進屋裏去。</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>次日的早晨，這學校裏怪熱閙的：平素要懶學遲到的孩子，都清早跑來了，小臉上都罩上一種鬱鬱的情緒，一雙雙靈活的眸子，呆看着忙在收拾行李的先生，先生也時時偷看他們一眼。</p>
<p>『先生去了還來麽？』</p>
<p>『我們國語還讀不到半本咧！』</p>
<p>『先生爲甚麽不教我們要回去呢？在這裏可多好。』</p>
<p>『我們不願意先生去，先生不要去吧！』</p>
<p>聽那種種輕幽幽的問話，王先生苦笑着。</p>
<p>校長同挑行李的脚夫來了。脚夫挑上行李，王先生緊跟着走出校門，校長同一大羣孩子尾隨着送到村子外進城的大路上。</p>
<p>『王先生，再會！再會！』校長張開扁嘴巴説。</p>
<p>『呵！校長，再會！』</p>
<p>『先生！先生！』</p>
<p>王先生一回頭，看見孩子眼睛裏大多濕塋塋的。</p>
<p>路遠了，王先生耳朶裏像還聽得一陣怪親熱的呌喴：</p>
<p>『先生！先生！』</p>
<h3>擣衣聲</h3>
<h3>嚮晚（四）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>「春陽旅館—春陽旅館呀。可不是嗎？」矮的仰起頭來笑。同時也站了下來。一個姑娘和一個老婆婆，便從這一對站着的配當中間穿過來。高的和矮的一起回過臉看那個姑娘。一張粉白的臉，二片火紅的頰。眼是浮腫而倦怠的。全個身段顯示出未成熟的斵傷。</p>
<p>二個人皆忘却應該説什麽了。</p>
<p>「阿是—去哇！」立刻有一種做作的聲音從耳邊浮起。那老婆子底一張文旦皮似的臉，就出現在他們二人眼前。</p>
<p>「哼！」各各從鼻子吐出一個輕薄的聲音。各各覺得眼睛應該洗個澡才會乾淨。於是立刻把眼眼向中山路那頭漂去，想找對冒着烟樣的光的眼的海！</p>
<p>「不是嗎？」矮的却揮起短腿走了。同時從褲袋裏取出一張紙頭。「大漢公司對面春陽旅館十三號！請來一敘。此致郭仁，李安二兄，弟胡一元上。」看着，就念了出來。</p>
<p>這回是高的跟着矮的走了。但高的總覺得一舉足間會把那矮的屁股踢破似的，不敢放開大步來。</p>
<p>春陽旅館是在大漢公司底對面。可是大漢公司底屋頂却高過春陽旅館。大漢公司底門面，也闊過春陽旅館。這天生的一對配當，走到大漢公司面前，却還找不到春陽旅館。於是又在人行道上站了下來，伸着頭往大漢公司望。</p>

<p>道理是很粗淺的，在國家法律上没有明白規定之前，男子死了妻子，既可以再娶，女人喪了丈夫，當然也可以改嫁。然而中國的情形就兩樣了。中國社會是祇准許死了妻子的男子再娶，而不答應喪了丈夫的女人改嫁的。倒並不是一件怪事，因爲中國是個最重倫常的禮義之邦！不孝有三，無後爲大。負有傳嗣之責的男子、死了妻子，不再娶一個來接替，試問祖宗的香火要靠誰繼承下去？自己願意再娶是再好也没有了。要是有個男子，死了妻子不想再娶，恐怕他們宗親族戚，也要代你弄一個女人進來，迫你和她生小孩子呢！至若女人，餓死事小，失節事大，喪了丈夫不思上吊殉節，已算不得巾幗完人了，還允許你改嫁？改嫁豈僅有辱家門，連固有的道德也給你踏碎了！倘有人問我，中國社會對於男女爲什麽會有這樣不同的看待？我只能回答道，禮教原來如此。這回答你還嫌不够嗎？</p>
<p>人們是很喜歡拿最近中國社會上發生的兩件事來作對照，而加以批評，藉以攻擊舊禮教之不合理的。一件是轟振上海社會，傳爲佳話的熊毛結婚，另一件是驚動天津社會，流爲笑談的王危結婚。這兩椿婚事之所以傳爲佳話，流爲笑談，就因爲前者是死了妻子的男子再娶，後者是喪了丈夫的女人改嫁。不然，若僅僅是兩件平常的婚姻，是不會這般惹人注意的。</p>
<p>其實，那些拿這兩椿婚事來作對照而加以批評的人，是未免太牽强附會的。因爲熊毛結婚是一事，王危結婚是另一事。這兩件事，在男子再娶和女人改嫁一點上看，前者爲舊道德所奬勵，後者給舊禮教所禁止，已經是不能相提並論了。何况再娶的主人翁是個社會上有特殊地位的男子，而改嫁的主角是個社會上有崇高地位的男子的妾。這能怪社會人士對於熊毛結婚加以贊美，對於王危結婚加以非笑嗎？危文繡之被人聲罪致付，下令驅逐，正是無廉恥的失節孀婦應有的愆咎！現在才於四面楚歌之下，逃到西湖去敲木魚，不亦悔之莫及嗎？正人君子及衛道之士，是不能不痛心疾首的！</p>
<p>然而一班對於反對危文繡的改嫁，代抱不平的人，至多也祇能抬出中國的法律來作護符，説中華民國的法律，並没有禁止孀婦改嫁的明文，故危氏的改嫁，實爲國法所容許。况危之與黎結合，僅居妾的身份，改嫁是自己應有的權利和自由，並不受法律所束縛。而且婚姻乃私人的行爲，又豈容他人置喙呢？可是呵，代危氏呼寃的人，你們切不要忘記，國家在有形的法律之外，尚有無形的道德。危氏的改嫁，即使爲法律所許，亦不能逃掉了社會舊道德的裁制。女人死了丈夫而可以改嫁，貞節二字要怎樣去保存呢？况黎公曾做過國家元首的大總統呵。</p>
<p>我敢下個武斷説：在中國，男權社會至少可再維持五百年！</p>
<h3>送行</h3>
<p>— 周漢</p>
<p>春雨絲絲地絲絲地吹着，天雖然老早亮過，雲兒密密地交織着，就好像時間還早呢。于迂望了窗口一下，不想起身，他的妻不相信天還早，就床頭的機關開了電燈，看了手錶，唉呀呀，已經六點半了。六點半，還不起來，怎麽來得及，兩人趕快穿衣洗臉，預備行裝。箱子雜物在昨天晚上就修理好了的，現在只有打補蓋。被頭帶去兩床，此外還要一床毯子，好吧統統　你帶走，于迂動手打舖蓋。没有經騐那裏行，第一次是打得鬆而且大，第二次打得緊一點，但也大得很。馬馬虎，没辦法，再遲一些火車就趁不及了。女人們出門自然麻煩的，光是打扮臉上的工作就得化去半個鐘頭，他一面在打舖蓋，一面呌她快點馬馬虎，但打扮是女人們的惟一工作，這却馬虎不得，你越催她快，她越快不來，第一次粉太厚了，難看，洗去；第二次双嫌太薄，加搽一點。照照鏡子的工夫也特别大，前面照照，後面照照，對影自憐似地一照就大半天。于迂打好了舖蓋，出了一身汗已經不大高興。看她那樣的化費寶貴的時間，心頭就冒火。如果是平常的出行，那已經破口駡出來了，現在她要遠行，忍耐一點給他感受他的温存也是應該的，而且昨天晚上已經吵了嘴，臨走的時候，又何必留給她一個不好的印象呢？于迂一想到這，默着不做聲，索性打火抽起香烟來等她。而在烟氣瀰漫之中，却將昨晚吵嘴的一幕回憶出來。</p>
<p>妻到昨天晚上還是不願意回家去，生活這樣窮窘，不回家有什麽理由？她説不出理由。但她不願意走。于迂發脾氣了，説道，「好，你不走也吧，以後的生活我管我你管你。」妻却横了心説蠻話，「不管我了？哼，説得那麽容易！看看吧，我在上海餓死，你也并不是怎樣的光榮呵！」「那你又不走，呌我怎麽辦呢？」于迂大聲呌起來了，最後駡了一聲，「媽的×，前生欠你的債，今生來收拾我了！」妻不願意走的原因，不過是一離别就三年，剛到上海找他不久，又要回去，情愛上分不開捨不得，——是重在情愛上面，而于迂不管這些，他完全是唯持主義者，被生活之鞭抽打得忘記了情愛了。妻明白他是不重情愛的了，不禁傷心，流起淚來，「我不願意走，只是不願意離開你吧了，而你地駡得一錢不值，你究竟是變成了一個什麽人了呢？」她放聲大哭，這可更使于迂難受，由煩惱而生愁恨之心了。「嘖嘖嘖女人，………」説着想起自己實在太過無情了，一轉念有點後悔，聲音也是温柔和平　　「我也并不是願意呌你離開我，可是，你要知道，我現在失業好久，生活没有辦法，一個人在這上海已經難以支持，再添上一個人，呌我怎麽辦呢？」順勢上去撫慰她一番，説些貼心體己話，妻這才答應走了。</p>
<p>如今時間已不早，妻還在故意化費光陰似地打扮，想要發脾氣又覺得不應該，不發脾氣那是眞忍不住。他抽了幾口烟，喊她，「馬馬虎，好囉，……快點快點；」妻在鏡子裏看出他的焦急煩燥，心裏又難受又好笑，也曾在腦裏起了一個念頭，多費一些時間打扮，將火車鐘點誤了；今天走不成，改明天，明天走不成，再改後天；再住下幾天。可是因爲昨晚已經吵嘴，明日住下去是會决烈的，不如早一天走的好，那種念頭這才取銷了。</p>
<p>兩人坐車趕到北站，時間已經不早，月台上在送行的人已經在車箱邊等車開了，于迂將妻安置好了以後，只説一句話，「你放心吧，我一有辦法就寫信呌你來。」妻的眼睛是紅潤潤的濕了。「車要開了，我走了。」説着就下了車，連頭也不回，一直出了月台。</p>
<h3>一臂之助</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>今昔之感</h3>
<p>— 茂華</p>
<p>現在説起來是已經六七年以前的陳話了，當我在寒暑期回里的時候，總看見許多乞丐上門來告化；討米，討冷飯，討銅板，祇要你肯給，他們是什麽都要的。而且他們有的是聯絡手段，只要一個乞丐在你家討得了東西，他退出去之後，馬上會通知其餘的乞丐們，弄得你們庭若市，應接不暇。—那情形，我看得非常討厭！</p>
<p>當其時，我稍微受到了一點教育，對於施捨乞丐是極端反對的。我以爲，一個人應該勞働，應該從事生産工作，應該用體力去換飯吃。像乞丐，就分明是消費者，不是生産者。雖則其中也不免有少數被擯在生活圈子以外的人，含羞求乞原屬被迫而出此，退一步説，是情有可原的。但證之「討飯三年，懶做皇帝」的俗諺，則安於自由閒散的告化生活而不思自拔者，的確也大有其人！如此，則施捨他正所以害他，正所以增長他的惰性，正所以葬送他的前途。—這就是我反對施捨的簡明的理由。</p>
<p>但母親的意見就恰恰和我相反。她以爲有東西施捨總是好的，到没有東西施捨的時候，自家也便倒霉了。顯然的，她有着一個迷信的觀念，那觀念部份的支持者是「大量有大財」那句老話。她衷心在希望着家運一年一年的向上！</p>
<p>我不忍拂逆母親的心，爭論了幾句也便由她去了。</p>
<p>然而母親和我意見不同的地方却還不止對付乞丐那一件事。像大除夕燒「年夜飯」便是鼍一爭論的題材。照成例，母親總喜歡燒很多很多的年夜飯，一直要吃到年初五「路頭生日」才爲止。我對於天天吃隔宿飯那件事是極端憎惡，當母親躱在米囤那里畚米的時候，我總吵着要少畚點，免得再天天吃隔宿飯。但她却響也不響，只當耳邊風。</p>
<p>我不耐煩地聽着：她喊一個名字畚一升米，家裏有十七八個人，她便畚十七八升米。而且其中有的是三歲未滿的小孩，實際上並不在我家吃飯的祖母曾祖母，把她們的食料也算在裏面，不是平空又多畚了幾升米嗎？然而我也就不再響了，反正她會置之不理的。</p>
<p>畚到後來，我聽得她貓也一升，狗也一升，這使我不能不發作了。但她的答語却很簡單：「貓有貓糧，狗有狗糧」。我知道爭論已不能發生效力，只好伸直喉嚨吃隔宿飯了。</p>
<p>顯然母親的意念又是建築在希冀的好兆上的，她期望能豐衣足食，家連一年一年的向上！</p>
<p>事實的發展是可怕的。那已是六七年以前的陳話了，然而拿來和今日的情形相比，家境衰落的迅速眞使我們感到極度的驚恐！現在，田地是没有了，一年到頭糧米吃，非常悽苦而悲慘。遇到乞丐上門已捨不得施捨什麽了，實際上也已没有什麽可供施捨，時常總弄到惡聽惡氣趕出去，空氣已壞得很！</p>
<p>現在是，年夜飯米有没有，還是問題：有了年夜飯米債主放不放我們吃，也還是問題。—爲了許多問題，母親無時無刻不在憂鬱中思考，謀解脱；無疑的，她先前的夢是幻滅了，畚米時候那種「貓有貓糧，狗有狗糧」的闊綽手段也已無從施展了。甚且，即使我怕吃隔宿飯，也已用不着我去反對了！</p>
<h3>放賑途中</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>亦顧慮不了外面呼呼的寒風，和沉重的密佈着彤雲的天空，正在向嚴厲中進展。雖然同夥們都感到一些畏縮，露着蜘蟵的神情，我們所負的責任委實太大了。在另一個地方，正有着無數嗷嗷待哺的飢民，男，女，老，幼……呻吟着，啼泣着，捧着癟癟的肚子，伸着細瘦的頸項，巴望着我們這一夥兒。無數將要垂斃的生命，刻不容緩地等候着我們去施救，我們是放賑的人呵。</p>
<p>就草草的吃了早飯，乘九點鐘的永車汽車前往七區。十一點鐘到四路口地方下車，寒風毫無情面地拼命向我們身上括，棉袍子飄揚起來可就跟單掛兒一樣，大家只得咬緊牙齒，雙手緊抱着胸脯，走得没幾步路，天空就有雪花往大地上灑，不知誰首先嚷：「怎辦，下雪了啊！」</p>
<p>「索性下雪倒也好，下雪天是不會十分冷的。」我説，這祇是一句安慰人的心的話罷了。究竟不是坐在關着門窗的屋子裏，這裏距離我們的目的地還有六十里崎嶇的山路，一點禦寒的東西都没帶，幾個坐慣公事房的同夥自然不免要呌苦。山野的風更如鋭利的鋼箭從絮絮的雪花中向每個人的面部刺來，雪花息在眼睫毛上溶化成水珠，躲在插袋裏的手亦不敢伸出來抹一下。</p>
<p>在幾個身子比較弱些的同夥心意中，是預備不前進了，我又得向他們勸告：「再多耐一些苦吧，無數的垂危的生命，是在我們的掌握中呢！」</p>
<p>抬起頭來望望天，熱氣從嘴裏流出來又消失在風雪中。</p>
<p>「雪恐怕就會停的吧？瞧那邊的天很爽亮……」可是眼前的雪團却越抛越大，越來越密，前面成了一片昏糊的荒漠，幾乎不辨去途，没法想，好容易的在一個村莊上雕到了幾輛轎子，講定每輛抬到山脚四十里路程付一塊五毛錢，可是抬到中途，赤露着腿足的轎夫們也受不了寒凍，同時，又怕天夜暗後摸不回去，自願收一半力錢，呌我們自己下來趕路，這又不能硬勉强他們的，只得咬咬牙齒再跑，再跑……</p>
<p>龜形的石板路上積了雪，再加上坐了二十里轎子的僵麻的腿，時時要滑跌，而且風還是這麽緊，雪還是這麽大，同夥們又起怨言了，「我們是去放賑災民的，現在我們自己却受到災民一樣的苦楚，還要被人家説我們是靠了災民吃飯的，他媽！這話多够氣人，戴慈善頭銜的先生太太，至多是化點錢看上一次義務戲，參加一次賑災遊藝會……」没結没完的一連串。</p>
<p>「算了吧，「貨到虵頭死，」這時走亦得走，不走亦得走！」</p>
<p>索性把帽子脱下，　衣解開，爬山……那做嚮導的漢子才開口説了一句稍安人的心的話：「你們住夜的七區上坑塘地方就要到了。」</p>
<p>白茫茫的天，白茫茫的地。時錶是六點鐘，空間還有點亮光，過了第四個山蛙，眞的就有一位馬先生下山來接我們，同夥們都不約而同的在拍去肩上的雪，脚上亦感覺暖烘烘起來了。</p>
<h3>伐柚木</h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>早晨，橙紅色的陽光篩過了綠油油繁茂的柚木底葉子，地面上漏着很多黄金似的閃動着的陽光底碎片。</p>
<p>美麗的小鳥兒，活潑潑地在枝頭上跳躍着，迎着橙紅的太陽，唱起「好早晨」的歌來。從枝頭的葉縫望出去，那晴亮澄碧的籃天，浮盪着一朶朶輕快的白雲。</p>
<p>一片無邊際的山林，像青蒼蒼的大海，給乳白的朝霧環繞着。霧在山林間遊行，輕快的，淡薄的，像土人的加答屋頂飛出來的坎烟，又像西洋人的玻璃窗上的輕鬆鬆的窗幃。</p>
<p>山林裏除了鋸子在柚木的樹身上發出來的單純的樂奏之外，空氣是靜謐得像深山裏竚立着孤另另的古寺。</p>
<p>一陣晨風從車蓋似的柚木底樹梢透下來，沙沙地捲到正在下面拉着鋸工作着的上了年紀的和興伯，使他連連地打了寒噤，遍身浮滿着鷄皮栗子。</p>
<p>「畢竟是上了年紀，老年人眞不中用，這點點的晨風，已有點忍耐不住了。」和興伯停了他的工作，有意無意地嘆了一口氣，同時，把胸前的鈕兒扣起來。「這時網谷正是炎熱得使人發悶的時候，然而這里——巴亞普（巴亞普在暹邏的北部，距離網谷五百餘里。）的天氣，已像深秋的季節一般了。」他跟着在他旁邊工作的土地人搭訕起來。</p>
<p>「和興伯你怎麽不回歸「唐山」呢？難道想在暹邏過一輩子嗎？」那個臉孔黑得像木炭般的「土番」，似乎也替這位離别鄉井，在「番邦」過着流浪的生活的年邁的和興伯躭心，憂悉。「可不是嗎？一個人百年之後，他的骸骨也得回歸「故土」，才能安心哩！」隨後他從口袋摸出裝成了的「栳葉」，和着一片檳榔，送往嘴裏去，很有味地細嚼着。</p>
<p>「回歸「唐山，」……「唐山，」我什麽都没有的！」</p>
<p>這分明是掀翻了和興伯心坎裏久已忘掉了的心事，使它重新地浮現出來，他重複地説：憂悶的虫頓時地爬上他那罩着一層乾豆皮似的臉上。</p>
<p>「怎麽？唐山的家裏，難道没有兒子嗎？」</p>
<p>「早死掉哩！」</p>
<p>「那末，媳婦呢？」</p>
<p>「窮人家那裏蹬得住年青的女人？丈夫還没死過百日，就跟人家去了！……」和興伯的臉孔更加憂鬱得難看，陰沉得像陰雨天底天空。</p>
<p>「啐」，土番吐出一口鮮血一般的口沫，隨後在口袋裏抽出兩銀根哈德門牌的香烟來，擦了火柴，把一根送到和興伯的手裏去，於是，霧似的白烟，裊裊的便從他們的口裏一縷一縷很幽閒地吐出來了。</p>
<p>沙沙地，抽木樹在鋸子下又奏出單純的音樂來了，然而，和興伯的心裏却孕育着滿滿的憂愁，低聲地感嘆着他的不知所終的命運，像將離開山林的柚木，隨處隨地飄着。………</p>

<h3>欣動一九三五年的大革命「色片」將代聲片而繼起</h3>
<p>— 諸家博</p>
<p>一九三五年恐怕又是世界電影史上，一個很可紀念的革命歷程吧！</p>
<p>無論如何，好萊塢已經有了相當的凖備，靜待着這革命的爆發了。上一時期的影界大革命，也是在七年以前。那時的“The　Jass　Singer”突如其來的將好萊塢的電影工業，一下子變成了有聲的，使照片變成了時代的陳跡，使各大影片公司不得不急速籌齊了一萬萬金元的額外資本，從事於聲片的攝製。那個時候，好萊塢的影業受了根本的動摇，使一切製片家，影片商人，以及導演，明星等，都相　失色起來。</p>
<p>現在一九三五已經在我們中間了。好萊塢，或者不止好萊塢一處，又在人心惶惶之中了。他們知道時代的變遷，是不可避免的，革命的潮流，是不可挽回的。但是這種變遷，却影響於影戲工業的全部，怎能不使他們追想往事，談虎色變呢？</p>
<p>不過上次是聲片革默片的命。現在是什麽來革聲片的命呢。不是德律維興（Television）或廣播電影。那個時期還須再等待幾年。現在崛起的英雄，是色片！</p>
<p>現在好萊塢的人，無論什麽人，無論在什麽地方，他們開口就是顔色，閉口亦是顔色。什麽二和色（Twc-component　color）哩，三和色（Three　component　color）哩，到處都可以聽得到，使外來的人，覺得好萊塢的人，都在瘋狂之中。其實，怎能恐他們呢？這不是「山雨欲來風滿樓」的一個現象嗎？</p>
<p>有些人説，以後的色片時代，比我們所已看見的聲片時代，或者更要偉大些。爲什麽呢？聲片當然是一個大變遷，一個大進展，但是，以全世界而論，我們要知道全世界的影戲院，祇有百分之六十五是有放映聲片的設備的。但是，等到色片出來了，一切影戲院可以無須乎添加特别的設備。那豈不是將來的色片，將比現在的聲片，更爲通行了嗎？</p>
<p>其實，在去年，一九三四年，和今年的年初，我們已經一部份的看到了這新興色片的面目。那就是喬治阿理所主演的「大富之家」中最後英庭覲見的一個塲面，和埃迪康泰主演的「恭喜發財」中後面大冰洪淋桶的一個塲面。我們在這兩個塲面之中，所看到的顔色的豐美融洽，是逈乎出於我們意料之外的。因爲這種顔色攝影術，就是上面所説的「三和色」的攝影術。而前此我們所看到的，不過是「兩和色」，其中祇有紅綠二色。在「兩和色」的攝影術中，祇有兩種顔色可用，所以結果是極不滿意，除去大紅大綠二色之外，都是灰暗無光的。現在「三和色」攝影術發明之後，色澤的分配極爲調融，而色程的境界，亦廣泛得多了。</p>
<p>在這種時代改進之中，我們不能不提到兩個偉人的名字。一個是「三和色」的發明家，高墨斯博士（Dr.　Herbert　T.　Kalmus），一個是米老鼠的創造者，華爾脱狄士南（Walt　Disney）。高墨斯遠在二十餘年以前，即一九一四年，就召集了許多同志，組織了一個研究所，專門探求銀幕上色彩放映的方法。他們幾個人，都是美國麻省理工大學（Ｍassachusetts　Insitute　of　technology）的畢業生。他們後來發明了彩色攝影法，就採了他們母校的諢號（Tech德克），稱那新發明的彩色攝影術爲德克尼色彩（Technicolor）</p>
<p>進步是很慢的。但是在一九二一年，他們第一次用「德克尼色彩」攝成了一張影片。當然，在商業的立塲上，並没有得到什麽成功。但是他們還是不折不撓的前進，而美國有許多顔色學和攝影學的專家，亦都恊力同心地帮助他們，使他們更爲感奮努力。一九二七年聲片盛行之後，他們更覺得影片中顔色之必要。不錯的，有好幾張歌舞片，其中都加了顔色的穿插，增中了觀衆不少興趣。</p>
<p>在最近的五六年中，德克尼色彩的應用，受了一種停頓，而色片的革命，亦就受了些阻礙，直到如今。其原因是，那時没有許多攝製色片的開末拉，可供影界大衆的需求。亦没有多數的技術人才，可供各公司的聘用。但是在這個時期中，高墨斯等一班人，在他們的研究上，却已得到了驚人的成功！即從紅綠的二和色，更進爲紅黄藍的三和色是也。</p>
<p>華爾脱狄士南的功績，亦是很可觀的。他在高墨斯試騐成之後，各攝製家因爲對於以前二和色的失望，正在懷疑不决之中，他毅然决然地和高墨斯訂了專利一年的合同。華爾脱狄士南想在這幾個月中攝成一全部色彩長片。他説：「我並不想將米老鼠或儍樂隊攝成色片。我要更進一步，製成一足尺的滑稽畫長片，用顔色來攝製。」</p>
<p>好吧，我們看吧。我們靜待這簇新的，色片時代的降臨吧！</p>
<h3>好萊塢人物對於中國的印象</h3>
<p>— 亦敏</p>
<p>歷來美國人心目中的中國，是一個極不開化的國家，男人仍舊拖了辮子，女子仍舊纏着小脚，他們以爲唐人街便是唯一的代表中國之地。所以但凡描寫中國社會情况的影片，差不多都有令人作三日嘔的醜態。</p>
<p>好萊塢的人亦不明瞭中國的狀况，因爲中國國際地位的降落，以致造成了他們藐視的心理。然而近年來對於中國了解的好萊塢人亦漸多了，他們抱了好奇之心來到中國參觀，結果有了很好的印象回去。下面所述的便是這些人對於中國的印象：</p>
<p>麗琳達彌泰曾到過中國的北平。她對於北平人物風俗，都很有詳細的研究，她時常對人説：「中國的北平，確是世界歷史上的名城。我到過舊日的皇宫，我想信，中國實在是一個前進的國家。北平的人，都和藹可親商店中的職員，好像德國的商人一樣，和氣而有禮貌。我不過在北平三個多月，極使我留連忘返。北平的風景更好，有許多地方實在是好萊塢所没有的。到現在我仍舊在想念着那個風氣樸厚的古城。」</p>
<p>露拉朋克海對於中國的印象更深。她生長在香港。當在廣東各處居住。她能够講流利的廣東話，她在廣東曾做過舞台上的演員，她深知中國社會狀况，她的見解是：「中國有中國固有的人情·風俗·中國人的舊道德是很嚴格的。中國的人民對於禮貌，極爲重視。雖然中國一般教育不普及，然而低階級的人們亦有極好的禮儀。其他就是信用了。中國商人之間互相經商，往往不訂什麽契約或立什麽合同。他們一言爲定，到了那時必然交貨付欵，極少意外的糾紛。」</p>
<p>威廉鮑惠爾對於中國有下面的立論：「中國南北各地我都到過。我對於廣東的見解，以爲是中國最開化之地，廣東省裏的人都有冒險的精神，這是特有的性格，而爲他省的人所不及的。上海不過是一個文物交通要地，也是東方第一繁華之地，連中國影業多集中於此。北平天津都是留有中國固有風氣的極好地方，人物的忠厚，風俗的敦樸，另有一番美處。我到了北平就希望中國的影城北平，東方的好萊塢或將在於北平。」</p>

<h3>王先生之秘密的魔力</h3>
<p>「王先生的秘密」自公開試映後，各界觀者莫不同聲讚好，一致推崇，不特譽爲國産滑稽片之王，且在世界滑稽片中亦得佔有一席地。日來各舞廳各宴會席上以及各種交際塲中，均以此片爲談笑資料，魔力之大，得未曾有，聞該片准於本星期五在金城大戲院公映，届時車水馬龍，定有一翻空前盛况也。</p>
<h3>莫斯科建築二萬座大戲院</h3>
<p>蘇俄首都莫斯科，現正在進行建築世界最大之電影院。該電影院係建在「娱樂」公園中，佔地兩英畝。將來落成之後，可容觀衆二萬人。該院並計劃裝置五百方尺之銀幕，及由外國購入百萬枝光力之放影機與發音機，因蘇俄本國尚不能自製如許有力之機器也。所有莫斯科三十家大戲院平時常告客滿，因此座位必須於每塲放映前數小時預定，遇有佳片時，則更須於一日前預定。最近放映之影片，有「柴伯伊夫」（Tchabaeff）「快樂的人兒」（Gay　Fellow）兩片爲最特色。「柴伯伊夫」係描寫俄軍英雄之紀事影片。「快樂的人兒」則純係喜劇，毫無宣傳之色彩。兩片均可與數年前，范朋克主演而打破觀衆紀錄之Thief　of　Badad一片相嫓美。英美影片少有在莫斯科放映者，即有亦多係舊片云。</p>

<h3>民族呼聲（Bordertown）（七）</h3>
<p>— 雪</p>
<p>曼麗路克的身體和面容，經過了一陣變化之後，忽然狂叫起來道：「你—你要是没有我，現在還在銀鞋作侍者哩。我使你發的財！你穿的衣服，都是我給你穿的。現在—你剛拿頸子洗乾净，就以爲你是上等人了。那是誰都辦不到的—你生就下賤的東西—和我一樣的。你是屬於我的—不要想離開我！」强尼咬緊了牙齒，慢慢地説道：「不與，我不能和你在—起。我知道我要的是什麽樣的人。你管不了我。我是向上的人。」曼麗喊道「他於你有什麽權利？你是屬於我的。我决不放鬆！爲了你，我才犯了殺人之罪！」</p>
<p>强尼奇怪道：「什麽？你犯了什麽罪？」曼麗道：「我害死他的—我害死了他。那是爲你。」强尼作著不屑的神氣，徐徐説道：「我看著你，就使我頭痛。從此以後，你小心些，知道些好歹，離這個地方遠遠的，離我遠遠的。」他説完了，就走了出去，尋找黛兒埃惠爾，可是月光仍舊普照在暖房裏，心上人却不知上那裏去了。</p>
<p>或者黛兒並没有想到再和他見面。或者在黛兒心胸之中，早已没有强尼拉米立斯的影踪了。確實的，過了一天强尼到埃惠爾住宅中去訪問她的時候，埃惠爾家的司闇曾經攔阻了他，但是現在的强尼，已經不是司開攔阻得住的人了。等到他走了進出，和黛兒見了面，黛兒不覺大笑起來。他慨然答應了和他一同坐著他的新車出去玩去。在他直心腸，並且迷惑於情愛的眼光中看來，她的這種行徑，還有什麽第二種解釋呢？</p>
<p>一天的下午，强尼很愉快地走進了自己的寫字間。他看見曼麗坐在他的寫字檯上。强尼縐著眉道：「我不是告訴過你，叫你少來這個地方嗎？」曼麗笑道：「大情人的事情這樣忙，這個地方没有人來照料興嗎？」强尼道：「好吧，以後請你多來照料照料。我要回老地方去了。」曼麗自己控制著，裝著笑容道：「哦，原來和那個女人，已經商量好了。大概很開心吧？」强尼隨隨便便地道：「唔，再開心没有了。等我簽好支票，發了薪水之後，就要回到老地方，去開一個更大的。她請我出門玩幾天。等我們回來的時候，就要訂婚了。」</p>
<p>强尼説話的時候，背向著曼麗，所以没有看見曼麗臉上的變化，那種憤火在内心上的燃燒，使她面上露著可怖的怪狀。他祇聽見曼麗説道：「事情既到這種地方，我亦祇好讓你去吧……但祝你前途幸福就是了。」她説著伸出手來。强尼不懂她的意思，但他却不能辜負她的盛意，所以也就伸出手來，和她握著。曼麗還繼續著道：「我説的是眞心話。我情願你步步高陞。我情願你前途快樂無盡。」</p>
<p>這幾句話，漸漸使他覺到不安起來了。他將手鬆開了説道：「我還有許多事。要趕快些。我追要將高而夫衣服，和禮服等整理整理……回頭再見吧。」曼麗很和善的道：「好吧，强尼，回頭再見吧。」她臉上的笑容，一直保持著，直到强尼出去之後。不過門一關，她的面容又起了變化。她一個人自言自語著道：「……他叫我害死他的—强尼拉米立斯—他説，要是我不動手，他就要打死我—我怕他—我不得不動手—强尼要的是錢—他知道他死了，錢就到他的手了—」這個計策成不成？她的狡獪的腦筋深思著。（未完）</p>

Having now completed his duties, and with the Wuchang Headquarters decided to be officially established on March 1st, he departed Nanchang on the 20th to come to Hankou. He originally planned to fly to Hankou at noon on that day, but upon receiving a telegram from Hankou stating that the weather in Wuhan was unfavorable and there was heavy rain, making it inconvenient to fly, he temporarily changed his plans and departed Nanchang by special train to Xunyang at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th.

<h3>Japanese Raise the Price of Exit Passports</h3>

<p>[Beiping] The Datong Company, established by the Japanese in Yuguan, has been forcibly selling entry permits since January of the 23rd year of the Republic. Anyone leaving the pass from various places inside the pass must purchase one, costing three jiao of silver dollars each. Now the Japanese and puppet authorities are planning to increase the price of the entry permit, charging one silver dollar each, euphemistically called an entry tax, which will be implemented next month. Also, the Japanese recently established a large-scale exchange in Yuguan Station. Anyone entering the pass with merchants who exchange pseudo-currency for hard currency are calculated at 80%. Also, in order to avoid the export of hard currency, the Japanese and puppet authorities, since the implementation of postal services with the Northeast, have issued orders to all post offices that all remittances from the Northeast to within the pass are calculated at 80%.

A month ago, the Japanese resold the red grain they had previously bought at a price of more than one yuan and seven jiao per dou. In order to satisfy their hunger, farmers had to buy it, reluctantly. Money is being sucked away by the Japanese.

<h3>The Impact of Germany's Response to the Anglo-French Declaration</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>The Anglo-French London Declaration includes the conclusion of four types of conventions, while also inviting Germany to return to the League of Nations. However, Germany's response only expressed agreement with the conclusion of the sky convention, remaining silent on all other points. What are its intentions? Foreign public opinion is greatly divided. Some say Germany's move aims to disrupt the pace of Britain and France, while others say it intends to create an anti-Russian front. Therefore, international attention is focused on the pivotal role of Britain. If Britain yields to Germany's request and allows Germany to only conclude the sky convention, the pace of Britain and France will inevitably be disrupted, and the situation in Eastern Europe will inevitably return to tension. Therefore, Germany's move contains, to some extent, the above two functions. However, according to yesterday's European dispatches, Britain's attitude is still to firmly adhere to the procedures agreed upon in the Anglo-French London talks on the third of this month, believing that the points discussed by Britain and France are interconnected and cannot be taken in isolation. At the same time, it also politely declined Germany's request for prior Anglo-German negotiations. From this perspective, the pace of Britain and France has not been disrupted by Germany's response. Furthermore, although the Soviet Union is somewhat suspicious of Britain's attitude, Britain has already notified the Soviet Union of the results of the Anglo-French London talks and has also explicitly sought the Soviet Union's views. From this point of view, Britain seems willing to respect the Soviet Union's intentions. Moreover, judging from yesterday's Moscow dispatches, the Soviet Union's attitude is in complete agreement with France, that the maintenance of peace should be holistic rather than partial, and should not favor Western Europe at the expense of Eastern Europe. It can be seen here that not only is the relationship between France and Russia unchanged, but the relationship between Britain and Russia has also not been affected by Germany's response. What is even more noteworthy is that Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, due to Germany's failure to abandon its ambitions towards Austria, has also been traveling diligently to visit the French and British authorities in order to consolidate Austria's independence. In view of these points, the role of Germany's response has suffered considerable failure.</p>
<p>As we have said before, Germany's wish seems to be to abandon its ambitions towards Western Europe and retain its freedom of action towards Eastern and Central Europe. Therefore, the peace in its mind is a partial rather than a holistic one. Conversely, for France and Russia, it is holistic rather than partial. The reason why Germany is unwilling to have a holistic peace system is because once such a system is established, Germany will have no way to recover lost territories or expand its territory. Therefore, if Germany were to accept the entirety of the Anglo-French protocol in its position, it would be tantamount to falling entirely into France's diplomatic trap. It is only natural that it cannot but have reservations. As for why France and Russia are eager for a holistic peace, it is because modern warfare often affects the whole body with the slightest movement. If one party is in trouble, the other is in danger of being drawn into the vortex. As in the last World War, which started only with the Austro-Serbian conflict, it was not long before all of Europe was in turmoil. Therefore, they believe that partial peace is not enough to guarantee the peace of all of Europe. Given the intricate complexity of the relations between countries today, the movement of one corner inevitably affects the overall situation. Therefore, to seek peace in terms of specific issues, one should aim for the peace of the whole world. However, at present, European countries are only reluctantly maintaining peace through mutual restraints. Although Germany's response is not enough to destroy this peaceful situation, a truly global peace in Europe can never be achieved by the current situation of horizontal and vertical coordination, mutual restraint, and confrontation.</p>
<h3>Britain Watches the Development of the Far East Situation</h3>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Visits Japanese Prime Minister and Minister of the Army</h3>
<p>To Open Up Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>Inquiring About the True Intentions of the Japanese Government and Public</p>
<p>Yesterday Afternoon Banquet for Japanese Dignitaries, Afternoon Visit to Naval Minister Osumi</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Wang Chonghui met with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and Vice Minister Shigemitsu on the 20th to exchange views on the issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation. In the evening, he hosted Japanese reporters at the Mingguo Hotel and issued the following statement:</p>
<p>My visit to Japan has neither a formal mission nor do I represent the National Government. During the past six months since returning to China, I have met with people from all walks of life and learned about the general attitude of the Chinese people towards Japan. Therefore, I took this opportunity to come to Japan to convey the attitude of the Chinese side to the Japanese government and public, and at the same time convey the intentions of the Japanese side to China, in order to promote friendship between the two countries. If I must say there is a mission, this is my mission. However, there is nothing else to announce regarding specific issues. (21st Denttsu Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At 9:00 a.m. today, Dr. Wang Chonghui visited Prime Minister Okada's official residence. Councillor Ding served as the interpreter. Wang first gave his reasons for coming to Japan, and then stated the following regarding Sino-Japanese cooperation:</p>
<p>In my personal capacity, I am willing to contribute to Sino-Japanese friendship. I intend to meet with famous figures from the Japanese government and public to hear Japan's true intentions regarding concrete strategies for Sino-Japanese diplomatic and economic cooperation, and to reveal the aspirations of the Chinese authorities, with the aim of promoting peace in East Asia. Furthermore, I hope to improve Sino-Japanese relations by establishing peace in the East, and I sincerely hope to resolve various East Asian political and economic issues, etc. Prime Minister Okada thanked Wang for his visit to Japan and said that the Imperial Government would spare no effort to assist Wang's efforts. Wang left after a thirty-minute meeting. (21st Denttsushin Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Wang Chonghui continued to meet with Minister of the Army Hayashi this morning for a considerable discussion. Minister Hayashi expressed his views as follows:</p>
<p>China should first stop anti-Japanese words and deeds. Secondly, China's anti-Japanese and insulting behavior is a significant stimulus to Japanese emotions, which has become a major cause of hindering Sino-Japanese cooperation. The main reason for the current state of Sino-Japanese relations is the result of past anti-Japanese and insulting behavior. Anti-Japanese activities in various parts of China or anti-Japanese education for young people seem to have considerable roots. I would like to ask if the Nanjing government has any corrective measures for this situation. Japan, of course, has full sincerity in Sino-Japanese cooperation, and I sincerely hope that your country will first express full sincerity regarding the above points.</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui replied:</p>
<p>It is absolutely not the case that China relies on Europe and the United States to carry out anti-Japanese activities, and there is no such imagination. However, it is inevitable that some people in our country, which has a vast territory, may have such thoughts. China strongly advocates Sino-Japanese cooperation and believes that this is the only path for China. However, there are also various complex situations between China and Japan. We should cooperate with each other to remove the causes. Regarding this point, I hope that your Excellency will give full consideration to it. The National Government is by no means insincere in suppressing anti-Japanese activities, but various things have not been able to come to fruition as soon as possible. Therefore, in order to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, we are very willing to make sincere efforts, etc. (21st Nichiren Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Wang Chonghui visited Naval Minister Osumi at the Navy Ministry at 3:00 p.m. today, accompanied by our embassy in Japan. Wang expressed his desire to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation from the perspective of East Asian peace. Osumi expressed his opinion on this, saying that the way to achieve Sino-Japanese friendship lies in the communication of will. Therefore, he hoped that prominent figures from the Chinese government and public would come to Japan for observation in order to use it as an opportunity for friendship, etc. (21st China United Telegram)</p>
<h3>Banquet for Japanese Dignitaries</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Wang Chonghui hosted a grand banquet for more than thirty Japanese dignitaries from various fields at the Imperial Rotary Club at noon on the 21st.

The grand banquet ended at around 2:00 p.m. After the banquet, Wang visited Naval Minister Osumi at around 3:00 p.m. and had a cordial conversation with him for a long time. (21st Lian Dian)</p>
<h3>Talk Pieces with Japanese Reporters</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Dr. Wang met with the press corps yesterday after meeting with the Foreign Minister. The questions and answers are as follows: (Reporter) On what basis do you hope for Sino-Japanese cooperation? (Wang) It is based on Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism. However, this requires the two countries to stand on an equal footing and help each other. Regarding this point, I hope that the Japanese government and public will not misunderstand. (Reporter) What are the views of the Chinese side on Sino-Japanese cooperation? (Wang) After returning to China, I have repeatedly met with people from various fields and they all believe that rather than economic cooperation, it is better to restore the Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, which have been in an abnormal state for the past two or three years, to normalcy. This is a prerequisite. Specifically, first, mutual understanding and recognition between the people of the two countries must be deepened. Second, Sino-Japanese diplomacy, which has been off track for several years, must be restored to normal diplomatic relations. (Reporter) The Japanese side is extremely dissatisfied with China's anti-Japanese and anti-Japanese goods movements and believes that eradicating anti-Japanese actions is a prerequisite for improving Sino-Japanese relations. What is your opinion? (Wang) This can be compared to personal problems. Friendship between two people can be destroyed by one party, but to restore friendship, both parties must approach it with sincerity. The same is true for problems between countries. That is, if the cause of anti-Japanese sentiment can be removed, I believe it will naturally disappear. (Reporter) Foreign Minister Hirota stated in his speech to the current session of the Diet that Japan has absolutely no ambitions towards China, and anti-Japanese sentiment should be stopped immediately. (Wang) If Japan adopts diplomatic policies in accordance with Foreign Minister Hirota's policy, the Sino-Japanese relationship will be easily resolved. (21st Denttsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hirota Explains His Aspirations for Diplomacy with China</h3>
<p>Working Hard to Adjust Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>Aiming to Achieve Peaceful Cooperation Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota stated in the Diet today in response to questions about his China policy that he is currently working hard to sort out Sino-Japanese relations, with the aim of maintaining peace in the East through closer cooperation between the two countries. Fortunately, foreign countries are now gradually understanding Japan's true intentions in the Far East. Personally, he has great trust in Chiang Kai-shek. If his belief is wrong, the peace of the East may be overturned, but he is working to sort out Sino-Japanese relations with this unshakable belief, in order to finally achieve closer cooperation between the two countries for peace in the East. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota answered the questions of Representative Haruhiko Sohara of the Kokumin Domei in the House of Representatives Budget Committee on his aspirations for diplomacy with China as follows:</p>
<p>It has been a year and a half since I took office as Foreign Minister, and I have not yet started on the China issue. This is a fact. I feel that if Japan is eager to misunderstand China, I am deeply concerned that this will create such a result. Therefore, I first carried out diplomatic work with countries other than China, and postponed China until later. If I am unable to remain as Foreign Minister at the time of the cabinet change, it is possible that my lifelong wish for thorough diplomacy with China will end without being started. Fortunately, today Japan's true intentions have been understood by various countries. I have no doubts about my attitude towards Chiang Kai-shek. If all my beliefs are wrong, the peace of the East will be overturned. There are also rumors about my beliefs among Chinese dignitaries, and for the sake of peace in the East, I should ask for cooperation. (21st Nichiren Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Representative Haruhiko Sohara raised a question on cultural undertakings in China in the House of Representatives. Foreign Minister Hirota answered as follows:</p>
<p>In the future, more attention should be paid to cultural facilities in China. So far, there are only a few facilities north of the Yangtze River. In the future, we also plan to seek practical ways to handle the Guangdong area. (21st Nichiren Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Refreshes Diplomatic Lineup to Cope with Extraordinary Times</h3>

(2) The venue for the Central and South American regional conference will be Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil. (3) East Asian regions such as China and Southeast Asia will be directly guided by the Ministry. (4) The US region will be convened by the Embassy in the United States to hold consul general and consular conferences at any time. (21st Nichiren Telegram)</p>

What is the government's view on this? (3) The anti-Japanese issue in Arizona, USA, is of great importance to the resolution of the issue in relation to US-Japan diplomacy.

<h3>US Congressman Suggests Setting Up a World Spy Network</h3>
<p>[Washington] According to the bill submitted to Congress today by California Democratic Congressman Duckweiler, the United States will set up a spy network all over the world. Duckweiler claimed that Japanese spies, disguised as fishermen, were scouting the movements of the US fleet during the Pacific maneuvers. He asked for an increase in the US Army's budget for the purpose of setting up spies. In the event of a conflict between Japan and the United States, Japan has already stationed a small army in California, which can launch an attack on the United States at any time. To cope with this crisis, the United States should consolidate the defense of the West Coast to a considerable extent. After a recent congressional committee investigated the propaganda and espionage work carried out by foreign governments in the United States for several days, it issued a report requesting funds to set up a spy network, which followed this report. The committee's report stated that Soviet Russia had failed to fulfill its promise to stop communist propaganda in exchange for diplomatic recognition. Germany, Italy, and Mexico were also spreading propaganda. Members of the investigative committee believe that the activities of foreign spies within the United States are a clear threat to democracy. Political observers here say that the United States' only spy system is the intelligence office of the Army and Navy, which is well known. The government generally opposes the adoption of a spy system, believing that this is a provocative plan in peacetime and is unnecessary. (20th National Telegram)</p>

<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt strongly advocated today that the National Recovery Act be extended for two years, but it is said that under this act, monopolies have been established, which have harmed industries and operators. Therefore, it is not certain whether President Roosevelt's efforts will be successful. The Senate Judiciary Committee will investigate the accusations against the monopoly system, and the Senate Finance Committee will also investigate the matter. Many Democratic members of Congress are dissatisfied with the effects of the recovery plan. Therefore, even though the Democratic Party has a majority in both houses of Congress, this bill may not be easily passed in both houses. President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress asking that the National Recovery Act be extended for two years without changing its fundamental purpose and principles. President Roosevelt said that the recovery plan has achieved its recent goal, which is to curb the downward trend of the recession and encourage the people to move forward. Child labor, which has long been criticized, has now been abolished. Factories that oppress workers have now been eliminated, and millions of wage earners are no longer suffering from the pain of low wages, unsustainable living, and excessive work. More importantly, the business community itself has clearly recognized the advantages of cooperation and self-control, and the need to end unstable financial and unfair habits in patriotism. The principles of the recovery plan are very sound. If these principles are abandoned, the harassment of industries will be revived. If industries cannot automatically fall within this scope, the government must have the unquestionable power to establish the minimum standards of fair competition, and the right of employees to organize themselves for collective bargaining must be fully protected. The rights of monopoly and private pricing systems in industries, especially in the oil, coal, and gas industries, cannot be allowed to exist. The American people need the government to supervise these industries in order to avoid waste and control their production, and to crack down on price-cutting competition and excessive profits. However, care must be taken to prevent the cooperative privileges that prevent unfair competition from turning into franchise systems that destroy fair competition. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hoover Advocates Restoring the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>[Tucson] Former President Hoover declared today that the United States should immediately restore the gold standard, thereby restoring the people's confidence in the dollar. The attitude of foreign countries can be ignored. Regarding the gold bond case, Hoover said that the judges of the Supreme Court clearly believed that the government's failure to pay public debt in gold was unconstitutional. The majority of people conclude that the people cannot resist this unconstitutional act. The current need is to restore the credit of the dollar. The present opportunity is suitable for restoring the credit of the dollar. All fears of future depreciation should be discarded. If we want to help the recovery of the poor, we should make the dollar exchange for gold based on the current market price of five dimes and nine cents. We do not have to wait for other countries before restoring the gold standard and the credit of the currency. Sooner or later, they will follow us to restore the gold standard. Foreigners fear our actions more than they fear our management of the currency because the latter will put us at a disadvantage. Hoover added that restoring the gold standard would have the following three results: (1) Reduce unemployment more than other steps. (2) Restore the activity of production tools. (3) Curb inflation.

<h3>British Trade Deficit</h3>
<p>[London] The Department of Commerce officially announced today that Britain's foreign trade in 1934 had a trade deficit of £1 million, compared with a trade surplus of £2 million in 1933. However, compared with the trade deficit of £51 million in 1932, there was still a lot of progress last year, so it is still possible to be happy. The Department of Commerce estimates that the income from British foreign investment was £175 million last year, £160 million in 1931, and £150 million in 1932. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Korean Revolutionary Leader Ahn Chang-ho Released After Serving Sentence</h3>
<p>Arrested for the Hongkou Bombing Case</p>
<p>More Than Four Thousand People Welcome Him at the Train Station</p>
<p>Pyongyang News: Ahn Chang-ho, the leader of the Korean Revolutionary Party, was arrested and imprisoned in Shanghai by the Japanese authorities two years ago. He was released from Daejeon Prison on the 11th of this month and was escorted by relatives and friends to his hometown of Pyongyang. There were more than 4,000 people welcoming him, and the area around the train station was packed. Because he could not shake hands with everyone, he stood high on the car, and everyone was happy to see the demeanor of the old revolutionary. Some were even moved to tears. It is reported that Ahn has been running for the revolution since he was a teenager. When Korea was亡, he fled overseas and engaged in the independence movement. San Francisco and Los Angeles in the Americas, and Shanghai and Beiping in China were all centers of activity for the man. After the January 28th Hongkou bombing case, Ahn was arrested by a member of the Japanese consulate at a friend's house in Baokangli on Avenue Joffre in Shanghai and then transported to the capital court of the country, where he was sentenced to four years in prison. Because of the pardon of the birth of the Japanese prince, the term was shortened, so it was possible to return to his hometown after twenty-six years. (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>Opening of Chinese Painting Exhibition in London</h3>
<p>[London] The Chinese Ancient and Modern Art Exhibition opened today at the New Burlington Galleries by the wife of the Chinese Ambassador, Guo Taiqi. The exhibition features 230 famous paintings, accompanied by a beautifully printed catalog containing Ambassador Guo's preface, a commentary by Laurence Binyon, a renowned author and authority on Eastern art, and a brief history of Chinese painting written by Liu Haisu. The chairman of the special committee assisting in the establishment of the exhibition, Sir Harry F. Fox, was unable to attend due to official commitments and sent a letter of apology, stating that "we can now appreciate representative works of the new era of Chinese painting, and then contemplate the spirit of Chinese art throughout the ages. This is a sign of the growing friendship between China and Britain. We now feel that the East may have teachings worth listening to for the West." Ambassador Guo addressed the guests, saying that the collected works "show that China, amidst revolutionary changes, still maintains the spirit of its ancient art. The progress of Chinese artistic creation is boundless, just like the creative power displayed by the Chinese people in all aspects of their national and personal lives. If our British friends appreciate these paintings with sympathy, they can gain a deeper understanding of the emotions and thoughts of the Chinese people. Thus, those who organized this exhibition can be said to have not worked in vain and have gained much." After Ambassador Guo's speech, the guests began to view the exhibits and praised the works one after another. Today, The Times published a detailed report on the exhibition, saying that "this exhibition is a delightful experience. Each painting is full of poetic meaning, excelling in spirit. The brushstrokes are bold and do not seek delicacy, and the style varies according to the nature of the painter." (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Waterworks Engineer Suddenly Disappears En Route to England</h3>
<p>Slippers Found on Deck, Presumed to Have Fallen into the Sea</p>
<p>[London] Mr. Stringer, a British engineer with the Shanghai Waterworks, who was on leave returning home, disappeared today on the Vienna steamer from Hook of Holland, Netherlands, to Harwich, England. Mr. Stringer had two companions on board, one of whom shared a cabin with him. When the ship was about two hours away from Harwich, Mr. Stringer suddenly disappeared.

<h3>Cuban Students Stage Mass Strike</h3>
<p>Support University Students Demanding Civil Rights</p>
<p>Havana The educational center of Cuba today held a mass strike. 125,000 public school students and 3,000 teachers went on strike to support university students. University students voted on Monday to support an indefinite strike. It is estimated that about 25,000 higher education students have joined the university strike. The crux of the situation is that university students are demanding the restoration of civil liberties and the disarming of the police. Liberal students have repeatedly protested to the military and police authorities, and the situation has gradually become serious. On Monday, it evolved into collective action. The government and military authorities acknowledged the public's opinion and expressed sympathy with the striking students, and are now on special alert to prevent any incidents after the student strike. President Mendieta announced that last week, the Communists started an incident and threw bricks at the British Consulate. There were as many as 50 bombs exploded in the streets of Havana. The government's initial intention to set up armed police was to prevent similar incidents. It is said that student leaders oppose the military government and do not want to attend classes until the republican government and civil rights are restored. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Annual Report of British Silver Company</h3>
<p>[London] Samuel Montagu &amp; Co. today released a substantial annual report, stating that the events of the past year have largely eliminated the instability regarding the trend of silver. U.S. legislation is a significant factor in the improvement of silver prices. The United States still needs more than 110 million ounces of silver, which seems predictable, but everything depends on the state of its purchases. In the absence of new developments, and based on recent experience, silver prices, even if not solid, can be guaranteed to remain stable for some time to come. It also said that in 1934, the world produced 180 million ounces of new silver, compared to 164 million ounces in 1933. At first glance, the rise in silver prices and the progress of the situation have not had much impact. However, it should be noted that silver is mostly a byproduct, and since the demand for low-grade metals containing silver is not abundant, the output of silver will naturally not increase sharply.

<h3>Italian Supreme Defense Committee Decides on Wartime Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>Nationwide Industrial Mobilization Ordered</p>
<p>Efforts to Seek Economic Independence</p>
<p>Military Measures to be Taken Against Abyssinia</p>
<p>More Than 10,000 Troops Awaiting Dispatch</p>
<p>Rome The Supreme Defense Committee recently held four meetings, which have now concluded. A communique was released today, detailing the possibility of Italian self-sufficiency in wartime. The communique stated that the Supreme Defense Committee has completed all tasks, prepared to take necessary measures in a timely manner, so that if Italy is provoked by other countries, it can stand undefeated. The Committee also studied the production sources of various necessities in the event of an emergency, and formulated a plan to directly control the production and consumption of these necessities in times of crisis. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome The Supreme Defense Committee issued a communique yesterday detailing the possibility of Italian self-sufficiency in wartime. The issuance of this communique is the first time in the 13 years of Fascist rule. The reason for this announcement is to reassure the people in response to their concerns. This is the same as the Fascist Supreme Council issuing a communique explaining Italy's military preparations in the event of danger in Europe. The announcement by the Supreme Defense Committee is specifically for civilian mobilization. As for military mobilization, it has been proceeding according to plan, as can be seen from the mobilization of reservists from the 1911 class. The prevention of poison gas has been specifically studied, and the results have been displayed at exhibitions in various places. The communique issued yesterday by the Supreme Defense Committee lists various substitutes. This list of substitutes was compiled and produced by the National Research Council under the guidance of the great scientist Marconi. This research is sufficient to prove Italy's efforts to seek economic independence. Italy has decided to reduce the import of foreign goods. This decision has forced Italian industries to find the raw materials they need domestically, without relying on foreign countries. Furthermore, the order restricting the quantity of imports is effectively closing Italy's doors, preventing most foreign products from entering. This order can be seen as a mobilization of Italian industry. The conditions set by this order are so strict that if Italian industry can operate normally, the Supreme Defense Committee's claim that "Italy can be self-sufficient in wartime" can be absolutely proven in fact. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Naples, Italy Italy considers Abyssinia's disregard for its war preparations to be unacceptable and will soon send another 15,000 troops to Italian Somaliland to urge it to reconsider. 3,000 troops have already set sail to join the Italian army on the front lines. The Italian government has openly expressed its displeasure at Abyssinia's neglect of this move. The troops conscripted this time to serve in East Africa are said to be the Misenna combat brigade. Official sources claim that these troops will depart by the end of this week, at the latest by March 1st. It is understood that Mussolini's purpose in sending more troops is to assert national prestige and force Abyssinian officials to submit. Meanwhile, news from the Abyssinian capital claims that Abyssinian leaders remain indifferent to the Italo-Abyssinian conflict. Abyssinia has stated that it will only follow the orders of the League of Nations. Abyssinia has dispatched elite troops to the mountainous areas to defend against an Italian attack. Since the deployment of additional Italian troops, the Italian front has not been attacked by Abyssinian bandits. The League of Nations Committee, which is currently meeting in the Abyssinian capital, declares that this incident can be resolved peacefully and that neither Italy's provocative attitude nor Abyssinia's indifference will cause any problems.

<h3>Austro-French Diplomatic Talks</h3>
<p>Non-Interference Pact as Main Topic</p>
<p>[Paris] Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Berger-Waldenegg, who are visiting France, departed last night. Le Matin reports, "The Austro-French talks will focus on the plan for a Central European non-interference pact. This pact emphasizes the transformation of the Danube River region. If it succeeds, the situation in Central Europe will surely return to tranquility." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Vienna Before departing for France, Chancellor Schuschnigg gave a statement to a Havas News Agency representative: "We will not allow any infringement on the political system currently adopted by Austria, as this system is of great benefit to normalizing the situation in the Danube River region and even Europe." The Chancellor continued, saying that his government is a faithful successor to the policies set by former Chancellor Dollfuss, both in domestic and foreign affairs. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Vienna Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Berger-Waldenegg departed for Paris and London last night at 8:10 PM, hoping for stronger international support for Austria's anti-German movement. Like Italy, Britain and France deeply desire that Austria not be invaded by the political and territorial ambitions of the Hitlerites. It is understood that Schuschnigg and Berger-Waldenegg intend to clearly inquire of the British and French foreign ministers what attitude the two countries will take if the National Socialists attempt to overthrow the Austrian government again. Austria's future depends on the answers of the two countries. If the Austrian government can rely on the military and financial assistance of Italy, France, and Britain, it can continue to resist Germany. Otherwise, it will have to make peace with Germany. Since the return of the Saar, the National Socialists have intensified their activities in Austria. As soon as the results of the Saar plebiscite were announced, Austria was filled with National Socialist propaganda, demanding that Austrians also vote for self-determination. Although the current government is fighting hard, it cannot appeal to either the left or the right, because it banned both the Socialist and Communist parties last February. Therefore, the government is unwilling to hold general elections immediately. If Schuschnigg and Berger-Waldenegg succeed in this trip, they will not need to appease other parties and will continue to build a Catholic group state, completing the work of former Chancellor Dollfuss. Another background of this negotiation is the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty. It is well known that Schuschnigg is an enthusiastic monarchist, but due to international relations, he still believes that it is not yet the time to talk about restoration. Observers say that his mention of this is because the major European powers and the Little Entente have not yet agreed to recall Archduke Otto. Therefore, Schuschnigg will inquire of Britain and France this time to gauge whether the time is ripe to make Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia no longer object. Schuschnigg's reason for restoration is that the Austrian people mostly want restraint. Therefore, if Otto ascends the throne, the National Socialist movement will die out. Another issue to be discussed with France is the Rome Protocols. Austria is certainly very grateful for this agreement, but if Germany is unwilling to sign, it will ultimately be ineffective. As for the London Agreement, Austria will also request the cancellation of the treaty's restriction on the army of 30,000 men. It is likely that Schuschnigg will request that informal troops, such as the Catholic Vanguard and the Home Guard, be merged into the formal army, and Britain and France will give this sympathetic consideration.

<h3>Formal Note Clarifying Position to Britain, France, Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Formation of East European Mutual Assistance Pact</p>
<p>As a Condition for Participating in the Air Defense Agreement</p>
<p>[Moscow] The French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Alphand, delivered a note to the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, stating that after French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval consulted with the British government authorities in London and concluded the London Agreement, the British and French governments wished to know the Soviet government's views on the purpose of the above-mentioned agreement. On February 19th, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Chilston, also sent a letter to Litvinov, expressing the same opinion. The Soviet government yesterday instructed its ambassadors to Britain and France to deliver a reply to the respective governments as follows:</p>
<p>"The announcement issued after the London Conference stated that this agreement 'aims to strengthen the cooperation between European countries to consolidate world peace' and at the same time 'to curb tendencies that could promote war.' The Soviet government expresses its welcome to this statement. The Soviet government has long held that in the current situation, since thorough disarmament cannot be achieved and supervision and restriction of armaments are also difficult, the only way to prevent international warfare is to conclude regional mutual assistance pacts between countries that genuinely wish to eliminate war. The Soviet government is delighted to learn that the British and French authorities have stipulated the conclusion of a pact to guarantee the security of European countries (especially the most vulnerable areas). At the same time, the London Conference has made further progress by stipulating that if a country is attacked in the circumstances stipulated in the pact, other countries will immediately provide assistance. The Soviet government believes that in the current situation, if war breaks out in Europe, it cannot be confined to one corner. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that under this unified plan involving all parts of Europe, we must recognize that mutual dependence is essential to preserve the security of the entire continent. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that the realization of the London Conference's goal of organizing European security must wait until all the various regional agreements and arrangements listed in the London announcement are fully realized. Conversely, if any of these agreements are neglected, not only will the purpose of 'consolidating the hope of peace' not be achieved, but the peace within the territories concerned will also be encouraged to be destroyed. The Soviet government is willing to believe that the drafters of this announcement also hold such thoughts. At the same time, the regional pacts that have been discussed by several countries before the London consultations will not only not be damaged, but will also receive new support from the London Agreement. After the conclusion of the London Agreement, we can say that the four major European powers, namely the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and Italy, as well as the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente countries, all agree with the idea that the most urgent and effective steps must be taken at present, using the method of mutual assistance pacts, to contain military aggression. The above-mentioned countries have a total population of 365 million, accounting for 70% of the total European population. At the same time, other European countries are also sympathetic to steps to consolidate peace. Therefore, those with tendencies to promote the current war crisis are in the minority. In such a situation, who would believe that the vast majority of European countries, working together to strive for peace, cannot complete the task of consolidating peace with the necessary means? The Soviet government welcomes the London Agreement under the condition that it is fully and indivisibly implemented in the spirit stated above and eagerly hopes that it will be implemented in its entirety with a firm spirit."

<h3>British Cabinet Resolves to Convey to the French Foreign Ministry</h3>
<p>Whether to Respond to the Russian Note Awaits Consultation</p>
<p>Negotiation Process Will Precede Germany and then Russia</p>
<p>[Paris] The decision of the British Cabinet has been formally conveyed to Foreign Minister Laval, which has aroused heated discussions and various speculations in the local newspapers. Some newspapers believe that Britain will raise certain questions to Germany to determine the true meaning shown in the German reply. However, most newspapers unanimously praise the British government's impartial attitude in handling the various issues in the Anglo-French declaration, as these issues are inherently interrelated and cannot be divided. However, the London attitude is considered to be quite cautious regarding Simon's visit to Berlin. As for the Russian note to France, the local newspapers especially consider it a major contribution to peace. L'Avenir believes that although the atmosphere of Anglo-French coordination and Anglo-Russian rapprochement is good, the future attitude of Britain is still uncertain. However, if Germany is unwilling to comply, Britain's attitude will not go beyond two paths: one is that Britain insists on its position in the Anglo-French declaration, and the other is to allow France to seek other means of mutual assistance. If it is the former, Germany's position will naturally become more difficult. According to the newspaper's observation, Britain seems to be taking the former path. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Anglo-French declaration of the two countries in London, according to a semi-official report from the Russian side, it is best to visit Moscow, or even Warsaw, after the British cabinet members go to Berlin. Well-informed sources here believe that if Moscow formally invites the British government, Britain will clearly express its approval. As for the British cabinet members going to Warsaw, no news has been received as of yet. In addition, as to whether to respond to the notes from Soviet Russia and Anglo-France, London believes that it should be jointly agreed with Paris. If it is believed that a response should be given, it should be agreed whether to respond jointly or separately. In short, the notes sent by the Soviet Russian ambassadors to Britain and France to the respective governments yesterday are extremely welcome to well-informed sources here. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Views are the Same</h3>
<p>[Paris] Today, the British Cabinet decided that the items recommended in the Anglo-French declaration of February 3rd are closely related. If the Anglo-German talks only select one item from the recommendations for discussion, it would be meaningless. French political figures are very satisfied with this decision of Britain, believing that this explanation of the British Cabinet is completely consistent with the French point of view. The governments of Britain and France will now make close contact through normal diplomatic channels. The visit of British Foreign Secretary Simon to Paris on February 28th is particularly important. In addition, political circles are focusing on the reply to Germany, as the previous German reply to the Anglo-French government's note did not address the Danube River Agreement, the East European Mutual Assistance Agreement, and Germany's return to the League of Nations. The British government's reply to Germany will inevitably inquire further in order to determine Germany's attitude towards these issues. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Britain is Concerned About Two Things</h3>
<p>[London] Regarding the issues arising from the Anglo-French declaration of February 3rd, it has been rumored that the British government has made representations to the Soviet Russian ambassador to Britain, and at the same time, the British ambassador to Russia has also consulted with the Soviet Russian government. According to well-informed sources, this statement is untrue. After the London talks, although the British ambassador to the Soviet Union exchanged views with the Soviet Russian government, this was the same as the statements made by British diplomatic representatives to other governments, merely delivering the Anglo-French declaration of February 3rd and giving verbal explanations to ensure that there would be no ambiguity about the intentions of this declaration, especially regarding the interconnectedness of the items recommended by Anglo-France, making detailed explanations. Apart from this, Britain has no other dealings with the Soviet Russian government. Well-informed sources also said that Britain's attitude towards Soviet Russia is concerned with nothing more than two things: one is that Britain is directly concerned only with Western Europe, while Britain does not assume the main task in Eastern Europe; the other is that Britain wants to give Moscow the feeling that Britain not only does not want to reduce Russia's security status, but also Britain is advising Germany to conclude mutual assistance pacts with its neighbors, with the intention of making Russia secure.

<h3>Changyuan Floodwaters Have Not Receded</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] Changyuan County Magistrate Zhang Qinglu telegraphed the province that the western end of the Zhengba embankment of the Guantai closure project was once in danger on the 16th due to the rapid current.

<h3>Investigation of the Confucius Temple</h3>
<p>Talks by Liang Sicheng</p>
<p>[Jinan] Tang Wencong and Zhong Lingxiu, who investigated the Confucius Temple, are now leaving Qufu to return to Beijing. Liang Sicheng passed through Jinan to return to Peiping, and Kong Lingcan returned to Jinan. Liang said that a wooden frame seven zhang high has been set up in Qufu to thoroughly examine the various halls, and there is no major damage, only rain leaks. The main hall and Kuixing Pavilion are relatively important, and the main wooden materials can still be used. It is planned to replace the eaves beams with concrete. The amount of money needed cannot be estimated because the price of wood is unclear. Pan Zhong will return to Jinan recently, and Liang will also return to Jinan within three weeks to jointly plan. Yu Haomin, a technician from the Construction Department, and Mo Zongjiang, Liang's assistant, are currently staying in Qufu to thoroughly measure and draw floor plans, which will be brought to Peiping for Liang to design. In addition, the Ministries of Civil Affairs and Education investigated the descendants of Yan Hui, Zeng Shen, Si Meng. They have been identified in Qufu and are now returning to Jinan together.

<h3>Japan's Economic Strategy (Dalian Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Realizing the Japan-"Manchukuo" Economic Alliance</p>
<p>Forming a Superior Position in the Far East</p>
<p>The idea of consolidating the Japan-"Manchukuo" economic alliance has been advocated for a long time, but it has not been fully realized. The reason is that order has not yet been restored within the four northeastern provinces, and economic construction cannot naturally enter the right track. At the same time, there are still various unresolved problems in Japan. Regarding the order in the Northeast, it doesn't matter much. As long as the areas along the railway can maintain their normal state, it can be muddled through, and there is no fear of other troubles. And the social and economic contradictions in Japan have a small impact on the four northeastern provinces. However, the disunity of civil and military affairs in politics will almost directly reflect back. For example, Japanese capitalists have finally encountered a golden age in the past three years, but the total amount of investment in the four northeastern provinces in recent years has been no more than 350 million yen. (This is still the nominal capital amount, and the actual amount is even less than this).</p>
<p>This number is probably less than half of the military expenditure in the past three and a half years. So why are they unwilling to invest? It is because the power of the military is rising, especially in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Kwantung Army. They are even more suspicious and fear that if something happens, their property will not receive definite political protection, so they are always hesitant and dare not easily invest in the four eastern provinces, but only try their best to expand their import and export trade.</p>
<p>After the Kwantung Army's control method was changed from three-in-one to two-in-one between the military and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the power of capitalists became even smaller and they had to obey the orders of the military commander. Although they are very dissatisfied, they can't do anything about it. Now, the controlled economy, and the co-existence and co-prosperity of Japan and "Manchukuo" are the controlled economy commanded by the military, and the co-existence and co-prosperity under the military sword. We can understand its content by looking at the outline of the Japan-"Manchukuo" Economic Joint Committee Treaty to be implemented in March this year.</p>
<p>'1. The Government of Japan and the Government of "Manchukuo" shall, in order to ensure the strengthening of industrial and economic control between the two countries, recognize the control and uniqueness of the economic division of the two countries, with the premise of not causing drastic changes in the other country's business organization, and for the purpose of jointly establishing a national standard policy, establish the Japan-"Manchukuo" Economic Joint Committee in Changchun.</p>
<p>'2. The composition of the Joint Committee shall be organized by a total of six members, three Japanese and three "Manchukuo" people (the Japanese side is the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, the Director-General of the Kwantung Bureau, and the Counselor of the Embassy; the "Manchukuo" side is the Chief of the General Affairs Department, the Minister of Industry, and the Minister of Finance). Under the Committee, the two governments of Japan and "Manchukuo" shall appoint an equal number of executives.</p>
<p>'3. In order to handle the affairs of the Economic Joint Committee, a secretariat shall be established at the location of the Committee.</p>
<p>'4. The governments of Japan and "Manchukuo" shall submit to the Committee for deliberation all common economic matters related to both countries in the leased territory of Kwantung Prefecture ("Liaoli Peninsula region"). Other matters such as deliberation, suggestion, investigation, and reporting on the strategy of Japan-"Manchukuo" economic cooperation shall be handled by the Committee.</p>
<p>'5. The regulations on the powers of the Japan-"Manchukuo" Economic Joint Committee, whether the committee members, executives, and advisors are participated by knowledgeable people from the private sector, although it has not been decided at present, but the committee's powers, all regarding the economic development of "Manchukuo", the Kwantung Army Command has the guiding power. The powers of the above two, the policies adopted, and the functions of research, investigation, exchange of opinions, deliberation and consultation for adjusting the economic control of Japan and "Manchukuo", the committee is an organ with all these functions.'</p>
<p>From the above five organizational outlines, we can fully see the content of the so-called Japan-"Manchukuo" economic alliance. Moreover, it clearly pointed out in the fifth item that the Economic Joint Committee must be guided by the Kwantung Army, in other words, it is controlled by the Kwantung Army. Not only can the local people not participate, but also the capitalists in Japan cannot but obey the leadership of the military. Moreover, it is also preparing to further 'promote the economic relationship between "Manchukuo" and China', expand the power of the Kwantung Army, and form an economic alliance in the Far East. The operation of this kind of attempt in European and American countries is completely to use economic power to control, always taking financial capital and industrial and commercial capital as the center. The method used by Japan is very different, taking the military as the center, and using military force to solve everything. (Dalian, February 12)</p>
<h3>He Yaozu Passes Through Hankou from Beijing to Hunan</h3>
<p>Embassy Organization Expenses Determined and Will Depart Soon</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Yaozu, the newly appointed Ambassador to Turkey, arrived in Hankou on the 19th from Beijing by postal plane. On the 20th, he went to Hunan to visit relatives and will stay for a few days before returning to Hankou to wait for an audience with Chairman Chiang before going to Beijing to prepare to go abroad. The reporter interviewed Mr. He at the Yangtze River Hotel. According to him, since receiving the government's order to be the Ambassador to Turkey, he has been actively preparing everything, but he has not been able to travel for a long time because the embassy's expenses have not been determined. The embassy organization has been generally prepared, and it is planned to appoint Wang Fansheng as Counselor, He Fengshan, Li Wenxian, Wang Shifu, Ma Hongdao, etc. as Secretaries, Lu Feng as Attendant, and Li Yaoyu and Yao Zhuxiu as Secretaries. The expense budget has also been approved by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Central Political Council for approval, generally equal to the embassy in Japan. He has already sent Counselor Wang Fansheng to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, via England to prepare for embassy affairs. He is scheduled to lead the rest of the staff on the Italian cruise ship Conto Rosso on the 13th of next month to take office. Turkey has become increasingly prosperous and strong after political reforms, and its international status has risen sharply. It has washed away the shame of being the sick man of the Near East and is closely related to our country's revitalization movement. After taking office, he will strive to promote Sino-Turkish relations in order to live up to the government's trust. As for the Sino-Turkish trade treaty, it is necessary to increase the commercial affairs of the two countries. He will first exchange opinions with the authorities of that country, and then follow the orders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss and proceed. (19th)</p>
<h3>Yu Yongnan, Former Director of Finance of Anhui, Murdered</h3>
<p>Second Son and Two Grandsons Still Missing</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Yu Yongnan, the former Director of Finance of Anhui and once the Assistant Governor, was kidnapped by bandits in Guanzhuang Street, which belongs to Qianshan County, his hometown. His wife, second son, Zhu Xun, eldest grandson, Shi Mei, and grandson, Shi Shizhu, were also kidnapped. After the news of the case came, those in Wuhu who had a relationship with Mr. Yu planned to raise a large sum of money to find a way to rescue them. While they were running around, they suddenly received a telegram from Anqing from Mr. Yu's eldest son, Yun Xun, saying that his father (Yongnan) had been brutally murdered by bandits in Tuoling, at the junction of Qianshan, Taihu, and Wangjiang counties. It is rumored that his wife has been released, but his second son and two grandsons are still missing. As for the cause of the murder, it is said to be due to accumulated grievances with the bandits. Friends of Mr. Yu were all saddened by the news. After leaving the officialdom, Mr. Yu moved to the South Gate of Anqing. Because of the changes in the political situation in recent years, Mr. Yu was regarded as a senior in the political circles of this province, and generally several people came to ask for his introduction every day. In order to avoid the noise, Mr. Yu moved to Guanzhuang Street, his hometown in Qianshan, a year ago to retire and serve his mother. He assisted in local charitable undertakings in many ways. The year before last, he went to Shanghai to ask various charitable organizations for disaster relief in the county. He fell and injured his leg on the way. Although he recovered after medical treatment, he still felt inconvenience when walking and had to use a cane when going out. A few hours before he was kidnapped, the outside world was very tense. Mr. Yu initially suspected that it was a rural gambler who had lost a bet and was robbing, but he did not know that a large number of bandits had approached the village. After receiving several reports, he suddenly realized that he was heavily surrounded by bandits. Even if he wanted to escape, it was impossible. This was the general situation when he was kidnapped. Unexpectedly, he was killed in the shortest period of time, which is really tragic. (20th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Farmers Bank Regulates Rural Finance</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Farmers Bank is the earliest farmers bank established among all provinces. Its purpose is to regulate rural finance and develop agricultural production. In recent years, it has progressed quite rapidly and has achieved considerable success in providing relief to rural areas. We have obtained information on the progress of its operations in the 23rd year from the bank itself, and record it as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Bank Capital: The bank's capital has increased annually. As of this year, in addition to the original capital of 2.2 million yuan, an additional capital of 1.4 million yuan has been added, totaling 3.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Branches and Offices: The branches and offices added in the 23rd year include Shanghai, Yixing, Jinshan, and Fengxian in Jiangnan; and Qingjiang, Suqian, Taixing, Baoying, Dongtai, Funing, Dongkan, and Lianshui in Jiangbei. Including the original branches and offices, there are a total of 22 branches, 14 offices, and 7 agency offices, totaling 43.</p>
<p>(3) Overall Bank Business: The total deposits and savings of the entire bank, as of recently, amount to more than 8.6 million yuan, an increase of approximately four times compared to the previous year. Loans are targeted at rural cooperatives, and are classified according to their nature, including seedling loans, storage pledge loans, and marketing loans. The coordinated implementation of these three types of loans is a characteristic of the bank's lending. The total amount of various loans for the entire year, excluding savings offices, is more than 7.595 million yuan, an increase of more than 4.96 million yuan compared to the previous year. Among the loan balances, "warehouse storage pledge" and "marketing loans" are the most numerous, accounting for nearly 60% of the total. The surplus for the 23rd year is 110,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Business Situation: (A) Cooperative Business: The bank has worked hard to promote cooperative businesses and has achieved considerable results. Among the types of cooperative loans, seedling loans are the most common. In terms of the number of cooperatives, a total of 1,500 cooperatives received loans throughout the year, and in terms of the amount of loans, it totaled 2.4 million yuan. The amount of loans repaid on time by cooperatives accounted for more than 90%. (B) Agricultural Warehouses: Warehouse storage pledge is the most effective method for regulating agricultural product prices and is also the bank's central policy for regulating rural finance. Since last year, the bank has attached great importance to the management of warehouse storage pledge, and has established many agricultural warehouses in various places. According to statistics, warehouses have been established in 39 counties, with more than 170 warehouses. The total amount of storage pledge loans has reached more than 4 million yuan as of recently, of which 90% of those requesting pledge loans are small farmers. The storage quantity is as little as several sheng or one dou, and the pledge loan is no more than two or three jiao, which also shows the hardship of the rural economy. The stored items include rice, beans, wheat, miscellaneous grains, bean cakes, flour, silk, cotton, cloth, and sheepskins. It is estimated that each bank stores pledge loans of about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and some as much as 600,000 yuan. In addition, the bank's warehouses also handle processing and marketing. The more effective ones are the Dongting Warehouse in Wuxi, which has a larger scale and the latest rice milling machine, and the Anfeng Warehouse in Dongtai, which has the latest cotton ginning machine. There are also those that specialize in mortgaging agricultural tools, such as the Yugou Warehouse in Qingjiang, which pledges more than 30,000 agricultural tools. Although there are currently more than 170 agricultural warehouses handling storage pledge, given the abundance of agricultural products in Jiangsu Province, the need is still more than this. It is heard that the bank plans to expand to more than 250 warehouses and store pledge 6 million yuan in the 24th year. (C) Cooperative Marketing: The bank believes that agricultural products from various places cannot be transported and sold, making it difficult for rural finance to circulate flexibly. In order to handle the marketing of agricultural products for farmers' cooperatives in various places, a agricultural product marketing office has been established in Shanghai as a centralized marketing agency for agricultural products in the province, and branch offices have been established in Wuxi, Yancheng, Rugao, Xuzhou, Qingjiang, Taixian, and other inland areas to facilitate communication. The main tasks of the office are "cooperative marketing" and "cooperative purchasing." The former mainly involves rice, wheat, and wheat, followed by cotton, pigs, daylily, native cloth, soybeans, and flowers. The latter mainly involves fertilizers and seeds, followed by machinery, cotton yarn, cattle, and diesel. Since the office was established in May last year, it has been in operation for seven months until the end of the year, handling marketing and purchasing amounting to more than 1 million yuan. Regarding agency marketing, the method is that the branch offices in various places or the agricultural bank assist the cooperatives in collecting, processing, grading, and packaging agricultural products. At the same time, the bank advances funds and then handles shipping, insurance, and other procedures on their behalf. After the agricultural products arrive at their destination, all pier care, contact with warehouses, handling sales, and collecting payments are handled by the marketing office. The office also employs specialists to study and handle the marketing of miscellaneous grains, cotton, and pigs, in order to be meticulous. Farmers feel it is very convenient.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Bizarre Robbery Case</p>
<p>At the home of Zhu Qiutian, a farmer in the 20th Tu of the First District, at around 6:00 PM on the 14th day of this month (lunar calendar), five people suddenly arrived wearing various colors of clothing and carrying firearms. They fired shots to intimidate people and searched each room, smashing cabinets and boxes. While they were causing a commotion, nearby residents heard the noise and gathered a crowd. The five people, knowing that it would be difficult to escape, claimed to be winter defense militia from Xinqiao Town in the Third District.

They immediately reported to the Xinqiao Public Security Lookout, who dispatched police to take the five people away. Now, villagers such as Yu Xuesheng are concerned about public safety and have petitioned the county government to investigate the matter thoroughly. It is heard that the county government has not received a report from the Public Security Bureau on this case, making it difficult to ascertain the truth, and the matter is quite bizarre. They have ordered the bureau to investigate the actual situation and bring the arrested criminals to justice for investigation.</p>
<p>Anti-Smoking Association Encourages Smokers to Confess</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the regulations on smokers confessing in this county, the County Anti-Smoking Committee, the County Party Department, the County Government, and the Public Security Education District Office and other agencies jointly organized propaganda teams to go to bustling places inside and outside the city to give speeches in rotation and promote the regulations as much as possible. They also distributed propaganda materials and pamphlets, and posted slogans everywhere. The district chiefs in each township district supervised the township Baojia chiefs to hold events at the same time, which was very lively. It is hoped that smokers who have not yet obtained licenses will confess within the time limit to avoid criminal charges. It is now known that Xia Fugeng, a private smoker from Zhalin and other places, went to the County Anti-Smoking Committee today to apply for confession. After filling out the confession application, the committee sent police to escort him to the smoking cessation center to be properly treated. They can be weaned off in about six or seven days. Secretary Yao of the committee gave Xia Fugeng and others encouragement and instructed the smoking cessation center to give them preferential treatment to assist and encourage them.</p>
<p>Dredging the City River and Building a Dam at Kaiyong</p>
<p>Dredging the city river in this county began last year, but was suspended due to disputes among the residents over the design and fundraising. However, the city river has become extremely shallow, and it is necessary to continue dredging for the people's drinking water and water transportation. County Magistrate Jin has ordered the First District Chief Li Zufu to be responsible for continuing the work. After convening local people to discuss solutions, the city river to be dredged was divided into six sections, and each section was assigned a director to preside over the project. The total cost, in addition to the allocation from the county construction fund, was short of about 8,000 yuan. District Chief Li also consulted with Chairman Cai of the Chamber of Commerce to raise funds. All sectors, recognizing the necessity of dredging the river, voluntarily donated enthusiastically. Bailongtan was not originally included in the dredging plan, but now, at the request of Cheng Weiru, a representative from the area, he volunteered to raise 800 yuan to dredge it. The Dredging Committee has appointed Vice Chairman Cai and Director Qian to conduct on-site surveys. The first section from Dongmenkou to Guangming Bridge Lane, as well as the third and sixth sections, began dredging yesterday with pile driving and dam construction, and are expected to be completed in about 20 days, followed by the other sections.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation held its February standing committee meeting of the executive committee in Wuxi yesterday (21st). On the same day, a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members was also held to discuss matters pending discussion by the federation. Chairman Yu Xiaochuan had previously obtained the consent of the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce and sent out notices inviting committee members from various places to come to Wuxi on time for the meeting. The committee members had arrived in Wuxi one after another in the afternoon of the previous day and stayed at the New World and Wuxi Hotels. At 9:00 AM yesterday, all the committee members took a steamship from the Dayou Stake Pier at Gongyun Bridge to Meiyuan, Xiaojishan, Yuantouzhu, and other places for sightseeing. At 12:00 noon, they had lunch at Chenglantang in Yuantouzhu. At about 2:00 PM, the meeting was held in Jingxiang Water Pavilion. The committee members present included Chairman Yu Xiaochuan (Zhenjiang), Standing Committee Wang Jingting (Jiangdu), Lan Bohua (Tongshan), Cheng Ganqing (Wuxian), Wu Suying (Wuxi), Zhu Zhongjing (Jiangyin), Pang Qinsheng (Yixing), Yin Jiquan (Wujiang), Gu Lunan (Zhenjiang), Dai Boqiu (Xinghua), Zhang Xiaoyou (Huaiyin), Supervisor Qian Chunyi (Taixing), and (Taicang). Those present included Yang Hanxi, Chairman of the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, Cai Jiansan, Cheng Jingtang, Lin Junbao, Chairman of the Wujin Chamber of Commerce, and others. Chairman Yu Xiaochuan presided over the meeting and Li Bosen recorded the minutes. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) Chambers of Commerce in Jiading, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Yixing, Liyang, Minhang, Zhenjiang, Kunshan, Yancheng, and Taicang have repeatedly sent letters and telegrams stating that the Ministry of Finance has shortened the deadline for collecting business tax, which has a great impact on the future of commerce, and earnestly requested that the ministry be transferred to the provincial ministry to allow the cancellation of the order. How should the association handle this in order to achieve it? Resolved that the business tax is originally collected quarterly according to law. If it is regarded as overdue and a late fee is collected in the third month, it is contrary to the principles set by the central government. In the face of commercial decline, it is even more difficult to do so. The relevant departments of the central government should be immediately reported to inform Jiangsu Province to correct it. (2) The provincial government ordered the General Assembly of the China Aviation Association to send the articles of association for standardization and requested that the letters be transferred to the chambers of commerce in various places to invite local groups to form a branch within one month of the arrival of the letters. How should the association proceed in accordance with the order? Resolved that the letters should be divided into the chambers of commerce in various counties to carefully plan and proceed. (3) The Kunshan Chamber of Commerce applied to join the association as a member in accordance with the articles of association and requested that it be recognized so that a certificate could be issued. Resolved to pass. (4) The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce proposed to prevent speculation in cotton yarn and requested that it be transferred to the relevant ministries and councils of the central government to help cotton mills and maintain the livelihood of workers. Resolved to pass the proposal. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM. The committee members took the original ship to Baojie Changqiao for sightseeing, and then returned to the city. In the evening at 6:00 PM, the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for the committee members at the New World Western Restaurant to fulfill the obligations of the host. The members returned to their hometowns today.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Prosecution of the Caoqiao Murder Case</p>
<p>The Caoqiao Town murder case, which caused a sensation in the three counties of Wuxi, Yixing, and Yixing, initially identified Zhou Zhongsheng, the town chief and commander of the security corps of the town, as having an affair with the daughter of Renchun Sauce Garden. Later, the woman found another lover, causing Changsheng to become jealous and kill her, abandoning the body to eliminate traces, etc. Later, a body was found by Taihu Lake. After the prosecutors of Wujin and Yixing jointly examined it, it was the same as the case of abandoning the body in the murder case that was reported. Yang Kongyi, the chief prosecutor of the Wujin County Court, went to the countryside to investigate and repeatedly summoned the people involved in the case for interrogation, and the truth of the case began to emerge. Yesterday, the criminal court of the court was prosecuted. The content of the indictment recognized that Qiu Changsheng and Wei Baolin, members of the corps, killed an unknown person while on patrol. Zhou Fulian, the husband of a boatman, Han Chuanbao, abandoned the body. Zhou Zhongsheng, the head of the corps, could not prove that he had jealousy and murder, but as the head of the business corps, the corps members killed people and did not report it, and abetted the abandonment of the body and the destruction of evidence. The prosecution was based on legal provisions. The criminal court will summon witnesses to open a public trial within days.</p>

<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Investigation of the Private Sale of Opium</p>
<p>Family Members Bribing Arrested</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee recently sent investigators Wu Yeyong and others to Gaoyou to work. They first arrested Zhou Junqing and Wu Xiaoxian, who were privately selling opium, and sent them to the county government along with the private opium and account books they had seized. After questioning, they were first detained. Zhou Lisan and Wu Qi, family members, asked Jiang Xu, the female owner of the Zhonghua Lou Inn outside the North Gate, to bribe the investigator Wu, stating that it would be 200 yuan. Wu pretended to contact them. After the money was handed over, Wu immediately sent Zhou Lisan and Wu Qi, along with 150 yuan of the bribe money, to the county government for investigation. After the county government opened a court session, Zhou Lisan did not admit to bribery, but Wu Qi confessed. The court ordered Zhou Lisan to be detained (Zhou is also a private opium offender), and Wu Qi was released on bail from two merchants. The trial continued yesterday, and Jiang Xu, the female owner of the inn, was summoned to court. Zhou Lisan still did not admit to bribery, but Wu Qi accused Zhou Lisan of asking Jiang Xu to contact him. Zhou Lisan and Jiang Xu both swore that they did not admit it. Later, investigator Wu was summoned for questioning. Wu replied that Zhou and Wu had both come to see him, and Jiang Xu, the female owner of the inn, had also asked to be introduced, which was true. At this point, the court ordered Zhou Lisan to be detained, Wu Qi to be released on original bail, and Jiang Xu to be released on merchant bail, pending submission to the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association for review.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>

Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 PM on January 30th, a group of thugs suddenly came, speaking the local dialect and using boulders to break open the gate, surrounding the front and back. A part of them swarmed into the house, wielding iron rulers, wooden sticks, sharp knives, and other weapons, claiming that they must hand over Wang Hong. They searched everywhere upstairs and downstairs and finally found him. Without saying a word, they beat him with iron and wooden sticks, and he immediately fell to the ground unconscious. They stabbed him with sharp knives, his brains splashed everywhere, and his throat was pierced. He died on the spot, and the fierce people left. There was no loss of property in the house. His wife and eldest niece were also seriously injured at the same time. It was late at night, and the family, apart from Wang Hong himself, were all weak women and children and could not resist, resulting in this tragedy.

It is said that the victim's family has sued the county government, and it should not be difficult to find out the truth.</p>

The Star Company also went to film newsreels, and the atmosphere at the pier was unusually enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Traveling Companions</p>
<p>Those who accompanied Ambassador Yan and Mei Lanfang on the same ship to Russia this time included playwright Yu Shangyuan, Zhang Pengchun, Professor of Nankai University, Zhou Jianyun and his wife, Hu Die, China's representatives to the Soviet Russian International Film Exhibition, Mrs. Wu Nanru, wife of the Chinese agent in Russia, Jiao Xiangzong and his wife, Secretary of the Embassy in Russia, Mrs. Wei, wife of Secretary Wei, Tian Baoqi and his wife, Vice-Consul in Vladivostok, Mrs. Xu Nianceng, wife of the Consul-General in Berlik, Yao Yuying, a dan (female) role in the Mei Lanfang Troupe, Wang Shaoting, an old male role, Yang Shengchun, a young male role, Liu Lianrong, a painted face role, Zhu Guifang, a female martial role, Wu Yuling, a male martial role, Xu Lanyuan, a musician and lute player, Huo Wenyuan, a string player, Ma Guiming, a flute player, Luo Wentian, a large gong player, Tang Xiguang, a small gong player, Liu Jianfang, a sheng (reed pipe wind instrument) player, He Binkui, a drummer, Sun Huiting, a moon lute player, and Han Peiting, who manages the props backstage.

<p>Mr. Yan's Speech</p>
<p>Ambassador Yan met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship yesterday and gave a speech before his departure. He said that at this time of serious national crisis, the people of the country must be sincere and united internally in order to achieve a consistent effect externally. At the same time, the people should have absolute faith in the government, and the government should be open and honest with the people. Only in this way can we work together to achieve a unified approach to the outside world.</p>
<p>Special Ship Direct Sailing</p>
<p>According to the crew member managing the Northern Steamer, the ship sailed directly from Shanghai to Vladivostok without passing through Kobe or Tsuruga in Japan because the ship was specially for transporting goods for the Association, so there was no need to stop in Japan. The journey from Shanghai to Vladivostok is expected to take six days. If there are no obstructions such as wind or fog along the way, it is expected to arrive in Vladivostok by the end of this month, and then transfer to another ship to Moscow, which will also take six or seven days, arriving in the Russian capital around the ninth of next month.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang said in a conversation on the ship before his departure: (1) The Soviet Russian invitation was made last February and has been in contact for a year. I am very grateful for the government's encouragement and the support of all parties before the trip. (2) It was originally planned to go to France, England, and Italy to perform along the way, and to visit the theater arts of those countries in Central Europe for research purposes. Dr. Lalou, Secretary-General of the French National Theater, has repeatedly sent letters and telegrams stating that the director of the National Theater is very much looking forward to me performing in the theater and has prepared a very detailed plan, which is very touching. The British side was contacted by the British Foreign Office and Ambassador Guo Taiqi, who said that people in the theater industry in their country were very much looking forward to my performance for research purposes. The former Chinese ambassador to Italy sent an official letter stating that he had been ordered by the Roman government to invite me to perform in Italy. All of them could not be answered due to time constraints, which is very regrettable, because I will leave Russia at the earliest in late April, which is past the European theater season, and it is already summer, and the weather is getting hot, which is not suitable for theater performance. (3) A few days ago, I suddenly received a telegram from the Chinese Embassy in Russia saying that the Cultural Association requested to add two days of performances to the original scheduled performance date and to add one or two more plays because the theater industry in their country wanted to see more performances for research purposes. I have replied to the telegram agreeing to it. (4) After arriving in Russia this time, I plan to visit Sweden, Germany, France, England, Italy, Switzerland, Poland, and Greece after the performance, and to see the scenery. I will return to China around the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. In addition, the situation has been reported in the newspapers, so I will not repeat it. (5) When boarding the ship, I suddenly received a telegram from Ambassador Zhang Xinhai of Poland forwarded by Mr. Chu Minyi stating that the Polish authorities plan to invite me to perform for a few days when I pass through the Polish capital, according to the Soviet Union's hospitality principles, and I hope that I will agree. However, since England, France, and Italy have all contacted me, I have not been able to respond, so I am not able to agree alone. I plan to send a telegram of polite refusal after arriving in Russia. The Russian ship Northern is scheduled to arrive in Vladivostok on the 26th or 27th, and I should be able to arrive in Moscow by the 8th or 9th of next month at the latest. It is agreed to rest for seven or eight days before going on stage to perform, so that there will be no misunderstanding of the Soviet Russian government's schedule.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Yan's Return to Office and Photo on Ship (Taken by Xu Tianzhang)</h3>
<p>Hu Die on the Right, Mei Lanfang on the Left, and Zhang Ming on the Far Left</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou's Speech</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhou Jianyun, the Soviet Russian International Film Exhibition opened yesterday. It is difficult for our country's representatives to arrive before the closing ceremony, so the Russian side has agreed to extend the exhibition period and postpone the closing ceremony. We originally planned to take a plane to Moscow after arriving in Vladivostok, but due to the severe cold weather in the area and the difficulty of flying planes, we decided to take a special train with Ambassador Yan to the Russian capital.</p>
<h3>Economic Depression in Shanghai: Local Associations Discuss Relief Plans</h3>
<p>Request Central Bank to Release Large Loans to Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Both Chinese and Foreign Financial Institutions Increase Mortgage Lending on Real Estate</p>
<p>Shanghai is suffering from the overall economic downturn, resulting in an extraordinary decline. Local associations and other groups have repeatedly convened meetings to discuss recovery plans, requesting the Central Bank to release loans for relief, and Chinese and foreign financial circles are negotiating to undertake real estate mortgages. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Local Associations Gather to Discuss Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Associations, jointly organized by leaders from various industries, recognizing the decline of various sectors, convened a joint meeting on February 3rd to discuss relief and recovery. They decided to form a subcommittee to study the matter. After several meetings, they met again yesterday afternoon and reportedly decided to proceed with both short-term and long-term solutions. For the short-term, they requested the Central Bank and other designated institutions to continue allocating funds for mortgage lending to provide some turnover in the market. For the long-term, due to the seriousness of the issue, they are still conducting further research.</p>
<p>Various Industries Request Loans for Support</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from various important business sectors that they are facing extraordinary difficulties due to the economic downturn and the extraordinary decline in the market. Simultaneously, banks and financial institutions are being particularly cautious with lending to various industries, resulting in tight credit conditions. Furthermore, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are providing loans for support only to banks and financial institutions. Therefore, after discussions, they plan to jointly request the Central Bank to designate large sums of money for mortgage lending to various industries.</p>
<p>Financial Circles Discuss Real Estate Mortgages</p>
<p>The real estate industry has been affected by the economic downturn, leading to a sharp drop in prices. Various sectors now recognize that real estate represents the largest asset in Shanghai. Furthermore, real estate businessmen are typically engaged in other businesses as well, and the failure of a real estate businessman will inevitably affect other businesses, impacting the entire market. Chinese and foreign banks are deeply aware of this and have held discussions to provide support for real estate mortgages within the possible scope.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market Prices Fall Consistently</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee announced yesterday at 10:00 AM that the equalization tax rate was 5.75%. The Central Bank's telegraphic transfer selling prices are as follows: London, one national currency unit equals one shilling and six pence; New York, one hundred national currency units equals thirty-six US dollars and sixty-two and a half cents; Paris, one hundred national currency units equals five hundred and fifty-two francs; Berlin, one hundred national currency units equals ninety and a half marks. These prices, which convert national currency to foreign currency, are slightly higher than those of the previous two days.</p>
<h3>China Agricultural Loan Syndicate Invites Banks to Participate</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Office Established and Loans Initiated</p>
<p>Offices in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, etc., to be Established by the End of the Month</p>
<p>The China Agricultural Loan Syndicate, organized by the Bank of Communications, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Kin Cheng Banking Corporation, Chekiang Industrial Bank, and the Farmers Bank of Four Provinces, established its office at the Bund branch of the Bank of Communications after its founding. Staff members were transferred from the Shanghai branches of the Bank of Communications to begin operations. A reporter from the New News Agency learned yesterday that the syndicate has decided to first establish offices in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces. The Shaanxi office has already been established in Xi'an, with Lu Zhigu appointed as director, and has begun lending. The other offices are to be fully established by the end of this month. Directors and staff members have been assigned. This year's plan is to provide three million in credit loans. Syndicate directors Zou Bingwen, Li Zhongchu, Zhu Runsheng, and Yang Yinpu plan to depart from Shanghai in mid-next month to inspect the offices after the offices in the four provinces have been established. Furthermore, in order to increase capital and expand the lending area, after the syndicate's charter is revised, printed, and ready, invitations will be sent to various banks to participate in the joint operation. It is reported that the Bank of China and the New China Trust &amp; Savings Bank are prepared to participate, as these two banks have consistently supported agricultural lending and have already implemented it.</p>
<h3>Financial Advisory Committee to Hold Subcommittee Meetings</h3>
<p>To Study Issues such as Stabilizing Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that the Financial Advisory Committee, organized by the Ministry of Finance, was formally established on the 16th of this month. The appointed members are all experienced financiers. The committee's mission is to plan methods for stabilizing finance and recommend them to the government for implementation. Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the committee's first step towards stabilizing finance is to prepare for international exchange control. A reporter from the New News Agency visited various members of the committee yesterday morning to inquire about the truth. All members stated that they were unwilling to express any opinions before the government made a decision on the matter. However, according to another source, Minister of Finance Kung believes that various financial issues, such as stabilizing exchange rates and adjusting domestic finance, need to be studied. The Financial Advisory Committee will convene a subcommittee meeting in the coming days to jointly study them, and then submit the research results to the government for reference and implementation.</p>
<h3>Borrowers of Loans from the Central Bank and Other Banks Request Renewal</h3>
<p>Over Five Million Still Outstanding</p>
<p>The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications jointly released over seven million in mortgage loans at the end of the last major period to stabilize the financial market. A reporter from the New News Agency learned from the Central Bank yesterday that over five million of these loans remain outstanding as of yesterday, and the borrowers are requesting renewal. However, the Central Bank and the other two banks require only that borrowers pay interest on time. Therefore, the principal of the loans will not be urged for repayment. In the future, if new borrowers request loans, they will be considered based on the situation. These loans are entirely for the purpose of adjusting financial circulation in the market.</p>
<h3>Five Banks Act as Agents for Collecting Aviation Donations</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the General Team Determines Measures</p>
<p>Since the China Aviation Association's Headquarters of the Solicitation Team began its second fundraising campaign, various activities have been carried out with great effort. In order to facilitate communication with the team leaders, the general team leader has appointed Secretary-General Li Dachao and Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Xue Baolun, Zhou Songhe, Zhu Shengyang, Zhou Xin, Li Jiming, and Gu Shangrui to contact the team leaders at any time and assist in the fundraising. The headquarters has now finalized the previous plan, and the staff members familiar with the situation have been assigned to contact several team leaders and assist with all matters related to the fundraising. It is reported that activities will begin separately today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Headquarters of the Solicitation Team has decided to request the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and Shanghai Municipal Bank to act as agents for collecting membership fees and donations submitted by the team leaders. In order to unify and facilitate the process, the headquarters has established five measures for the agency collection, as follows: (1) The Headquarters of the Shanghai Solicitation Team of the China Aviation Association has specially entrusted the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and Shanghai Municipal Bank to act as agents for collecting membership fees and donations submitted by the team leaders of various solicitation teams in order to unify and facilitate the process. (2) The banks will act as agents for collecting membership fees and donations from the team leaders for a period of six months, which may be extended if necessary. (3) When the banks receive membership fees and donations from the team leaders, the first copy of the membership fee receipt and donation receipt issued by the headquarters will be given to the payer for safekeeping, and the second copy will be submitted to the headquarters. At the end of the period, the third copy of the stub and any unused receipts will be sent to the headquarters for verification. (4) The banks should notify the headquarters of the amount of membership fees and donations collected by the team leaders at any time for publication. (5) If the team leaders need more receipts, they can obtain them from the headquarters on the third floor of the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge.</p>

<p>According to sources in Shanghai's banking community, in recent years, banks in Shanghai have concentrated cash in cities, while the market has been depressed and all industries have declined. Although the banks have profits, they are abnormal. Therefore, in order to seek the development of banking operations, it is necessary to seek the development of various industries. Adjusting rural finance is the foundation for the development of all industries. Bankers with vision advocate investing in the interior and adjusting the rural economy. Banks such as the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank first invested in rural areas and have achieved considerable results. Therefore, banks followed suit, and the rural areas have achieved significant results through the investment adjustment of various banks last year. At the same time, many banks have also profited from investing in rural areas. Therefore, the authorities of various banks have decided to increase investment in rural areas this spring. The amount of investment will account for one-fifth of the savings of various banks. The rural areas had a bumper harvest last year, and after this adjustment, the rural areas will inevitably develop day by day, and the relationship with social finance is not superficial.</p>

<h3>Ancient Artifacts for London Exhibition to be Displayed in Mid-March</h3>
<p>Exhibition Period Set for Three Weeks, Venue Being Prepared</p>
<p>The London International Exhibition of Chinese Art has leased Burlington House in London as its venue and is scheduled to officially open in November this year. This exhibition will introduce all ancient artifacts and art from Chinese dynasties to the international community, which is very important. Therefore, the search for exhibits is very comprehensive, from ancient times to 1800. The Chinese government has agreed to transport a portion of the ancient artifacts from the ancient artifact exhibition hall in Shanghai, which are rare treasures, for display. In order to ensure dedicated handling, the Preparatory Committee for the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art was established in Nanjing, with Minister of Education Wang Shijie specially responsible for all matters. The ancient artifacts were originally planned to be publicly exhibited once after arriving in Shanghai, but it was not realized due to the large number of boxes, complicated procedures, and lack of suitable locations. Now that the ancient artifacts will be selected and transported to London for exhibition, this opportunity is taken to first publicly exhibit them in Shanghai to allow people to appreciate Chinese artifacts and understand the exact number of artifacts being transported to England. The Bank of China on the Bund is renovating its old building and moving its office to the Third Road. The committee contacted the bank authorities to lease the old site as its Shanghai office and prepare to exhibit some ancient artifacts on the second and third floors for several days. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Tang Xifen, secretary of the Shanghai Preparatory Office, to inquire about the latest situation of the exhibition. Tang's remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Preparing the Venue</p>
<p>According to Tang, the office has moved into the new site for many days and is actively repairing the office buildings. The exhibition venue is being designed by architect Li Jinpei, who is voluntarily designing and arranging the venue (he is also planning and designing the warehouse in the capital that will store the ancient artifacts of the Palace Museum, costing 600,000 yuan). More than 10,000 yuan has been used to order 64 steel-framed glass cabinets from the Dahua Iron Factory for displaying art objects in the exhibition. For the safety of the ancient artifacts, iron fences are being installed at the exits of the venue and warehouse. The original electric lights and wires of the Bank of China have been reinstalled to avoid fire. The Public Concession Police Department has also agreed to provide special police protection.</p>
<p>Discussion and Review</p>
<p>The committee held its fifth specialized committee meeting at the Shanghai Preparatory Office on the afternoon of the 19th to discuss and review the exhibition items. Attendees included Xu Beihong, Deng Shucun, Ma Heng, Xu Hongbin (represented by Ouyang Daoda), Li Ji, Tang Lan, Yang Zhensheng, Guo Baochang, and Rong Geng (represented by Tang Lan). Gu Shusen attended as an observer. Three resolutions were decided: (1) Review the preliminary selection catalog, divided into three categories: calligraphy and painting, porcelain, and bronze. (2) Review will be conducted on Catholic Church Street this week and at the committee's warehouse next week. (3) Review will be conducted in groups: the calligraphy and painting group will be responsible for reviewing by Xu Beihong, Yang Zhensheng, Deng Shucun, Gu Shusen, and Ye Gongchuo; the porcelain group will be responsible for reviewing by Guo Baochang and Zhang Changyun; and the bronze group will be responsible for reviewing by Tang Lan, Li Ji, Xu Hongbin, and Ma Heng.</p>
<p>Planning the Exhibition</p>
<p>The exhibition will open in mid-March and close three weeks later. The catalog of ancient artifacts is currently being translated into English by Zhang Changyun, consultant to the committee, to facilitate appreciation by foreigners during the exhibition. The price of admission tickets has not yet been determined, but the preparations require funding, so it will not be less than two yuan. In the past, visitors to Beijing who wanted to visit the ancient artifacts of the Palace Museum had to take three routes, each with a daily ticket price of one yuan. Now that ancient artifacts from various places are gathered in one place, the ticket price will be higher, but the audience will not be affected. However, for the safety of the ancient artifacts and the order of the venue, the daily number of visitors has been limited to 2,000.</p>

<h3>National Products Promotion Conference to Open in Mid-March</h3>
<p>Application Submitted to Party and Government Agencies Yesterday for Record</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou Wrote to Kuang Zhongmou to Discuss Borrowing the Venue</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Promotion Conference, initiated by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, was postponed due to the approaching end of the traditional New Year. The association extended the deadline at the request of various factories. It is reported that the association has been receiving letters from disaster relief groups in various provinces, counties, and cities. The originally borrowed venue on the opposite side of the Great World is now unavailable because the landowner, Zhang Danru, has left Shanghai. Therefore, Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, wrote to Kuang Zhongmou to discuss borrowing the vacant land of the Penglai Market as the conference venue and scheduled the official opening for March 15th. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Application for Record</p>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association submitted a document to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday for record of holding the Shanghai National Products Promotion Conference. The document stated: "In recent years, water and drought have caused disasters, and Heaven has afflicted China. At this time of national crisis, rural collapse, and extreme social and economic panic, unfortunately, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces have suffered severe droughts again last year. The disaster is especially severe in eastern Zhejiang, with thousands of miles of red land, almost no harvest, and hungry and cold cries shaking the fields. The tragic situation is unprecedented. Mencius said, 'The heart of compassion is possessed by all men.' How can we not be saddened by the disaster victims who are waiting to be fed? Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces have always been known for their abundant products, and the prosperity of Shanghai's national product industry is also linked to this. Now that Zhejiang Province has suffered this unprecedented catastrophe, how can we turn a blind eye and not seek relief? In view of this, our association, based on the principle of gathering little to make much and accumulating sand to build a tower, has specially organized the Shanghai National Products Promotion Conference. The vacant land of the Penglai Market at Xiaoximen has been identified as the venue, and the official opening is scheduled for March 15th. The conference will last for three weeks. In addition to displaying national product exhibitions and establishing a temporary national product market, a recreation area will be opened near the conference to stage patriotic dramas or show national product films to entertain guests. Admission tickets will be distributed by various manufacturers with their goods, and the income from the tickets will be donated to disaster relief to help the victims. The method is good and the intention is beautiful, which is a win-win situation. In addition to applying to the Municipal Party Department (Social Affairs Bureau) for record, we respectfully submit this document to your council (bureau) for review. We respectfully request your approval for the record for the public convenience."</p>
<p>Lin's Letter to Kuang</p>
<p>The conference venue was originally discussed by Chu Huiseng, chairman of the Jiaxu Association, with Zhang Danru, using the vacant land opposite the Great World as the venue. However, Zhang has gone to another place, so there is no way to contact him. Therefore, Liu Zhongying, a member of the Standing Committee of the China National Products Manufacturers Association, wrote to Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai Market, proposing to borrow the market as the venue. Kuang expressed his deep approval of the association's purpose of promoting national products and helping disaster victims. However, the vacant land had already been introduced by Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, to the National Products Business Publishing House for a national products exhibition and had not yet been finalized. Therefore, he asked Liu Zhongying to communicate with Lin to proceed. After Liu communicated with Lin, Lin believed that the National Products Promotion and Disaster Relief Conference was very important, so he agreed to write to Kuang to allow the National Products Promotion and Disaster Relief Conference to be held first. His original letter stated: "Dear Mr. Zhongmou, This is to inform you that the Shanghai National Products Promotion and Disaster Relief Conference is jointly initiated by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, the Jiaxu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, etc. (omitted) It both utilizes national products and helps disaster victims, which is a win-win situation. The conference previously used the site opposite the Great World on Aidao Road as the venue. Now, because the owner of the land has gone to another place, there is no way to contact him. Thinking of your Penglai Market's vacant land, which is very suitable for holding national product business, I specially write this letter of introduction, and I hope that you will allow the loan to benefit the victims and help the righteous cause. Regarding the matter of Jiang Gufang of the National Products Business Publishing House borrowing the Penglai Market, which I introduced earlier, please temporarily suspend it. I am here to inform you. I wish you peace. Your younger brother, Lin Kanghou, February 21st."</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Approved Refugee Compatriots Departed for Qiaole Village Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Total of 19 People, Including Wu Zhengfa</p>
<p>According to the Industrial News Agency, 19 unemployed refugee compatriots, including Wu Zhengfa, who were approved for registration in the second batch by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghua ship yesterday to Wuhu, and then transferred to Shuiyang Town to enter Qiaole Village for reclamation and animal husbandry. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Public Security Bureau Assisted in the Departure</p>
<p>The refugee compatriots previously requested the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission member Chen Shuren to present a request to the Ministry of Transportation, instructing the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to provide free passage to Wuhu because they had no travel expenses. Subsequently, because the cost of living in Shanghai was extremely high and they could not maintain themselves, they had no choice but to ask their fellow villager Xu Jizhuang to help raise funds and beg the Municipal Public Security Bureau for assistance, requesting them to purchase half-price tickets. The bureau expressed sympathy for their plight and approved their request, helping them to find a way to purchase tickets, and they were able to depart.</p>
<p>List of the Second Batch Entering the Village for Reclamation and Planting</p>
<p>The following people boarded the ship to Wuhu yesterday: Wu Zhengfa, Xie Shaozong, Wu Menghan, Zhou Fuxing, Wu Shizhong, Wu Wenming, Mei Yinqing, Zhao Yongsheng, Lou Jinfang, Zhou Fenghing, Hu Wenhan, and Xiangzhi (Hu Wenhan's wife), totaling 12 people.</p>
<p>The 35th Batch of Eight People Returned to Their Hometown</p>
<p>The 35th batch of refugee compatriots who were expelled from Japan arrived in Shanghai on the 18th. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sent Hou Can to receive them and issued a temporary relief fund of five yuan per person. Because the application for registration for reclamation and planting is still under review, and the refugee compatriots are penniless and their livelihood is precarious, Ye Linxing, Ye Yinyue, Ye Baopeng, Xu Maixing, Xia Yancang, Huang Yanlin, Zhou Jinquan, and Wu Yanzi, totaling eight people, were assisted by Xu to seek help from the Public Security Bureau and boarded the Lian'an Company's Yili ship yesterday to return to their hometown. Once approved by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, they will go to the village for reclamation and planting.</p>

<h3>Director of the Sichuan Finance Department Liu Hangchen Rescheduled His Return to Chongqing for Today</h3>
<p>Discussed the Difficult Financial Situation in Sichuan</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that Liu Hangchen, member of the Sichuan Provincial Government and Director of the Finance Department, was summoned to Shanghai by Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi. He has been discussing the reorganization of the Sichuan financial problems with Kong for several days. The result was very satisfactory. He was originally scheduled to take Kong's private Kangdao aircraft to Hankou yesterday morning, and then transfer to Chongqing. However, due to unfavorable weather conditions, the flight could not take off, so he was rescheduled to take the China National Aviation Corporation's aircraft to the west this morning. A Guowen News Agency reporter met Liu at the hotel yesterday and asked about the financial situation in Sichuan. According to him, the financial situation in Sichuan has fallen into a state of payment without income. The total number of public bonds issued over the years has reached more than 87 million. Not only is reorganization difficult, but the current difficult situation is simply impossible to overcome. As a result, the Chongqing market is in a state of panic, with paper money rampant and bank runs occurring from time to time. In order to thoroughly reorganize, he plans to issue 120 million in new public bonds, to fully redeem the old public bonds, and to stipulate that the salt tax will be used as the principal repayment fund, and the field tax will be used as the interest payment fund, but has not yet been approved by the financial authorities.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Contemporary Figures</h3>

<h3>Security Department's Cleaning Campaign Postponed Due to Rain</h3>

If it still rains, it will be postponed again. However, the internal inspection, which is not affected, will still begin today and will not be postponed.</p>
<h3>Joint Lecture Meeting by Two International Associations</h3>
<p>Arnold Speaks on Sino-US Relations</p>
<p>Zhang Xianglin Speaks on the Chicago World's Fair</p>
<p>The International Problems Research Association and the International Trade Association jointly held a lecture meeting at the Bank Club on the 20th. They invited Arnold, the Commercial Counselor of the United States, and Zhang Xianglin, the chief representative of China's participation in the Chicago World's Fair, to give speeches. Dozens of members from both associations attended. Guo Bingwen, the chairman, briefly stated that both gentlemen had just returned to Shanghai from the United States. The two associations specially organized the meeting to welcome them and request their insights into the American situation. First, Mr. Arnold spoke, saying that various circles in the United States were becoming increasingly interested in understanding China. In the Pacific coastal states, "Asian Houses" had recently been established. The interiors of these houses were furnished to resemble various Asian countries, especially China, with a great deal of art. They often held gatherings to discuss Eastern culture and philosophy, and there were also libraries displaying books and magazines about the East for browsing. American universities had also been paying considerable attention to Chinese academia recently, and tourists were also fond of visiting China. Unfortunately, there was no corresponding organization in Shanghai to provide guidance, leading tourists to mistakenly regard the City God Temple as representative of China. He deeply hoped that everyone would pay attention to this, and so on. Next, Mr. Zhang spoke about the situation of the Chicago World's Fair last year, briefly stating that the United States did not restrict exhibits, but goods for sale were subject to import taxes. Chinese exhibitors initially did not understand the distinction between the two, resulting in significant losses. He hoped that future participants in the World's Fair would be careful, and so on.</p>

<h3>The Huade Factory's Invention of the Silver Light Bulb Approved for Patent</h3>
<p>The various Huade brand light bulbs produced by the Huade Factory on X'ian Road in this port have been sold for a long time and are well-received by all sectors. Recently, the factory has launched a new type of silver light bulb, which is not only energy-saving and durable but also exceptionally bright. It has now been approved for a patent by the Ministry of Industry of the National Government. It is reported that it was invented by Mr. Li Qingxiang, the founder and current assistant manager and chief engineer of the factory. Mr. Li previously worked at the Edison China Light Bulb Factory for more than ten years and has always been very knowledgeable in electricity and optics. At the beginning of the establishment of the Huade Factory, he was recruited by General Manager Tang Zhaoneng.</p>
<h3>Jin Jialu Sues Chai Chuangui, Judgment Rendered</h3>
<p>Since the Jiande Bank ceased operations, Jin Jialu, who served as the manager of the Hongkou branch of the bank, sued Chai Chuangui, the general manager of the bank, in the First Special District Court for criminal embezzlement, claiming that when he was in office, he had used a land deed as collateral, but was unable to retrieve it after the bank ceased operations. Judge Wu Zehan heard the case several times. The defendant Chai Chuangui, through his lawyer Cai Liucheng, argued that the land deed was nominally collateral, but in fact Jin Jialu had agreed to the bank using it to borrow funds. At that time, the land deed was transferred to a foreign firm for registration, and this agreement could be investigated, which showed that the defendant had no criminal liability. The court summoned an employee of the foreign firm to court for questioning. The case has now been argued to a conclusion, and the defendant Chai Chuangui has been declared not guilty.</p>
<h3>YMCA Opens a Mass Singing Meeting</h3>
<p>The public has paid little attention to the matter of mass singing. Recently, the Shanghai YMCA has specially opened a mass singing meeting to regulate the dull lives of young professionals and to awaken the long-lost national spirit. The musical directors invited are Liu Liangmo and Geng Yuanxue. The singing meeting will begin on the 28th of this month (Thursday). Young professionals from all walks of life who are interested in singing can go directly to the Shanghai YMCA on Sichuan Road or Baxianqiao to obtain a registration form.</p>

<h3>Manager of Heshun Coal Briquette Factory Assassinated</h3>
<p>Zhang Died</p>
<p>Four Suspects</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at [time unclear], [address unclear], Zhang, manager of [factory name unclear] Coal Briquette Factory was assassinated. Police investigation below.</p>
<p>Joint Coal Briquette Production</p>
<p>The Sihe Coal Briquette Factory, located in a shed at the above address, was founded by Ming Gui (60 years old) from Hebei, Xue Yushan, Wang Debao, and Xue Heshu from Qingjiang. Initially, the capital was only 450 yuan, but the business has grown steadily over the years. After eight years, the capital has increased to more than 1,700 yuan. Zhang served as the manager. Because the business scope was very small, Zhang also had to supervise the manufacturing and delivery, etc.</p>
<p>Sudden Assassination</p>
<p>Zhang's family also lived in Shanghai, but they all returned to their hometown at the end of last year due to matters in the countryside. Therefore, Zhang lived in the factory. At 0:30 AM yesterday, while Zhang was sleeping soundly, two men suddenly broke into the door, each holding a sharp dagger, and went straight into Zhang's bedroom. Without saying a word, they jumped up and dragged Zhang off the bed, stabbing his head and abdomen twice. Zhang woke up in extreme pain and fell to the ground, shouting "Ah ya!" Song Baiyan, a worker who shared a room with Zhang, woke up in shock and saw two figures running away in the darkness.</p>
<p>Rounding up the Murderers</p>
<p>Workers Song Baiyan and Chen San checked with a lamp and saw that Zhang had fallen in a pool of blood, on the verge of death. They immediately reported to the Robertson Road Police Station. Inspector Gu and Detective Team Leader Geng Shoubao, along with team leaders Cao Chuqiao and Zhang Desheng, received the report and immediately rushed to round up the murderers, who had already escaped without a trace. They sent the injured Zhang Minggui to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, due to a two-inch-deep stab wound to the head and a three-inch-deep stab wound to the abdomen, the injuries were too severe, and he died shortly after arriving at the hospital without receiving treatment. Afterwards, two daggers, about five inches long and extremely sharp, were found in his room. They were taken back to the Caojiadu Branch Bureau.</p>
<p>Suspects Apprehended</p>
<p>Subsequently, according to the factory shareholder Xue Yushan and the deceased's nephew Zhang Yi, who reported to the bureau, the deceased Zhang Minggui was very kind and had never had any grievances with anyone. The only possible reason for the murder was that Fan Weicai, He Anyi, and four other workers hired by the factory last winter were suspended by Zhang for violating factory rules. Fan and others hated Zhang very much, so Fan and others were suspected. After receiving the report, Wang Bicheng immediately ordered detectives Wang Yixin, Shi Yulin, Xu Deming, and Du Jingxiang to go to the Putuo Road Police Station and, together with the detectives dispatched, to the back shed in Beida Xuli, Robertson Road, to arrest Fan and He and take them into custody at the police station for temporary detention, pending a written report for questioning today. Chief Wang Dasui ordered Inspector Gu and the detective team to quickly apprehend the murderers and bring them to justice, as the case involved a murder.</p>
<h3>Zhang Pengchun Discusses Chinese Drama from Three Perspectives</h3>
<p>——The Following are the Directions for Future Efforts——</p>
<p>(1) Should have Analysis and Recording</p>
<p>(2) Revise the Script and Performance</p>
<p>(3) Should have more New Creation</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Pengchun, a professor at Nankai University, accompanied Mei Lanfang to Russia this time to assist in everything. Mr. Zhang has studied drama for a long time. Yesterday, he spoke with reporters about Chinese drama. According to Mr. Zhang, we can look at Chinese drama from three perspectives. The first is from a social status perspective, the second is from a theatrical art perspective, and the third is from a cultural change perspective. (1) From a social status perspective on Chinese drama, we have always looked down on Chinese drama, thinking that it is just a form of entertainment. Literati and scholars who are interested in drama, from the Yuan Dynasty to the recent twenty or thirty years, have only regarded scripts as a form of amusement. Drama in Europe has been comparatively [unclear word] more prosperous. From the Greek period to the modern era, although there were hundreds of years of seeming silence, drama had long been recognized as a legitimate branch of literature. Since Chinese drama has been looked down upon by the literati, its social status is also seemingly very low. Even now, I am afraid that we [unclear word] cannot avoid the old notion of looking down on Chinese [unclear word] and those who are related to drama. It is not [unclear word], but recently, because Western views on drama have gradually spread to China, everyone also knows that drama should be studied and created, and the social status of drama has also increased. (2) From a theatrical art perspective on Chinese drama, Chinese drama is different from Western drama. It is neither spoken drama nor opera. The organizational method of Chinese drama is different. In terms of writing, Chinese drama is a mixture of songs and recitations, and it is not entirely colloquial. For example, in the section of Si Lang Visiting His Mother in the Palace, the person playing Yang Yan Hui himself sings "Yang Yan Hui Sits in the Palace Courtyard..." There are very many such examples. The above is about the writing aspect of Chinese drama. Below, I will talk about the performance aspect. If we look at Chinese drama from the perspective of modern realism drama, it is easy to see Chinese drama as an incompletely evolved social legacy. However, the difference between Chinese drama and ordinary modern realism drama lies in the fundamental acknowledgment of the distance between "art" and "daily forms." For example, the singing and dialogue on stage are different from everyday language, the body movements on stage are different from everyday actions, the makeup on stage is different from everyday appearances, and the costumes on stage are different from everyday clothing, etc. In modern times, some people are dissatisfied with realistic art and want to create a form of art that breaks free from the bonds of daily forms. However, the methods of this general new art and the methods of Chinese drama have different points. They want to use personal divine sense to create a special way. Their creation naturally has a distance from daily forms, but it is difficult for others to understand. The method of Chinese art is based on handed-down customs and gradually forms an artistic "alphabet." For example, various body movements can all be analyzed into many simple movements. These simple movements are the "letters" of the body movements. Because these "letters" are handed down, they can be understood by the audience. Although the stage walk is different from ordinary walking, the audience can understand that the walking on stage should be like this. Therefore, Chinese drama, on the one hand, breaks free from the bonds of daily forms, and on the other hand, it can be understood by the audience. This is the difference between Chinese drama and modern realistic drama, and it is also the difference between Chinese drama and "drama that creates artistic forms individually." Since various forms are handed-down customs, how can we see personal strengths or personal creations? In general, it can be divided into three points: (1) A deep understanding and masterful use of each form. (2) The spirit of unity and integration of all forms. (3) After becoming proficient in the old forms, feeling the need to create new forms, and then creating them. If the new creation is accepted by colleagues and the audience, it is considered a teachable form. The reason why Chinese drama was well-received by drama researchers when it was performed in the United States last time was probably due to the above-mentioned characteristics of Chinese drama. Three years ago, when I went to the Soviet Union to visit education and drama, I had the opportunity to talk with the Soviet director Meyerhold about a method he used to train actors. He called this method "Bio-Mechanics." What he meant was to train actors in various movements so that emotions and body movements are closely linked. He said, "This method was produced by taking the method of training actors in Chinese drama as a reference." From this, it can be seen that Russian directors already have a considerable understanding of Chinese drama. (3) From a cultural change perspective on Chinese drama, the cultural methods of any country or era should be studied and preserved if they have noteworthy or valuable points of reference. However, we cannot say that this achievement can exist unchanged for a long time, because the cultural product of a place or a time must change with the "cultural climate." We should acknowledge that the scope of Chinese drama is narrow. Within this narrow scope, in order to enable Chinese drama to continue to exist in the world, we must strive in the following three directions: (1) Create systematic analyses and detailed records. Use tools such as photography, film, phonograph, text, and diagrams to make detailed analyses and systematic records of existing body movements, singing styles, dialogues, etc., for preservation and research. (2) Organize and revise scripts and performance methods. The plot must be deepened, the music must be accurately arranged, and the body movements must have a certain position and size. (3) Create new scripts, new music, new body movements, new makeup, and new scenery based on its own characteristics and using world art and science – non-realistic, stylized. If we do this, Chinese drama can occupy a considerable position in the modern world.</p>
<h3>Second Special District Court Seizes Yi Peiji's Property Yesterday</h3>
<p>All Houses in Albert Court Sealed</p>
<p>The Property is Managed by the China Business Corporation</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that the entire Albert Court on Albert Road in the French Concession of this city, as well as two houses located beside Hong An Court at the north end of the court, were suddenly sealed by the Second Special District Court yesterday, implementing a seizure. The seal read, "Seizure of Yi Peiji's Property by the Second Special District Court of Shanghai." After investigation by reporters, it was learned that the tenant of the court is the American-owned China Business Corporation. The court has a total of fifty-nine buildings, only twenty of which have been rented out. It was built in 1929 by the Song Shuntai Construction Factory. After the China Business Corporation learned of this, it sent people to photograph the seal for negotiation. The person in charge of the company stated that the property was not owned by Mr. Yi.</p>
<h3>Request from the United Cement Industry Association to Rectify the Guangdong-Hankou Railway's Purchase of Foreign Cement</h3>
<p>The United Cement Industry Association of China recently reported that the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau had ordered 40,000 barrels of "Red Dragon" cement from Haiphong, Annam, French Indochina, and imported it duty-free. This, they argued, adversely affected the sales of domestic cement and the spirit of the government's efforts to prevent dumping and increase tariffs. Therefore, they recently petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Railways, Communications, Finance, and Industry, requesting them to instruct the Railway Bureau to use domestic goods in the future and to promote domestic cement as much as possible to maintain the real economy. The original text of their petition to the Ministry of Finance is as follows: Request to the effect that the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau's purchase of foreign cement and duty-free import has caused public concern, and earnestly requesting relief to prevent further losses. Cement is a vital material for all construction projects. There are currently five cement factories nationwide, with an annual output of over four million barrels, which is more than enough to meet the country's needs. In terms of quality, they all exceed the standards of European and American cement. In recent years, not only domestic merchants have been using domestic cement for construction, but also foreign-managed or controlled projects, such as the Shanghai Public Concession and French Concession's two municipal councils, have been happy to purchase Chinese products due to their reasonable prices and high quality. However, according to reports from member companies of the Association, "The Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau has abandoned domestic goods and purchased a large quantity of Red Dragon cement imported from French Annam, amounting to as many as 40,000 barrels. According to investigations, the quantities transported in batches are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(Explanation) The "Shun Kang" vessel transported directly from Haiphong to Hankou, while the rest were transshipped from Shanghai by Butterfield &amp; Swire "Blue Funnel Line" ships, totaling 40,000 barrels.</p>
<p>The imported Red Dragon cement was exempted from import duties and consolidated taxes (approximately 4.20 yuan per barrel), so the bagged price for delivery in Hankou was approximately 5.23 yuan per barrel. It has been established that civil servants and government agencies should, as far as possible, use domestic goods for materials they use or purchase. This has long been a resolution of the Central Government and the Executive Yuan, and has been circulated for implementation. If the Guangdong-Hankou Railway's purchase of imported cement is based on quality, Red Dragon cement is not of superior quality. Compared to British cement standards, its performance may even be inferior to domestic products. In Shanghai construction projects, this brand of cement was previously only used for painting walls, which shows its quality. If it is based on price, the Railway Bureau did not follow the procurement principles and did not widely inquire about prices from domestic cement companies to make comparisons. Moreover, in the southern section of the Guangdong Railway, the locally produced Xicun Cement is nearby, and the price should not be too high. Furthermore, the obligations and responsibilities of domestic manufacturers to the country and society are incomparable to the indifference of foreign merchants. Even if the price of the same product is slightly different, the government should, from the perspective of the overall national economy, purchase domestic goods as much as possible to promote domestic industries. However, the Railway Bureau is not doing this, and is willing to purchase foreign goods, causing the country to increase its losses. How can the gains and losses be calculated? Considering both quality and price, there is no reason to use Red Dragon cement. Moreover, at a time when the trade deficit is increasing year by year and large amounts of silver are flowing out, and people from all walks of life are trying to remedy the situation, how can we tolerate domestic construction projects violating central government orders and economic principles by purchasing large quantities of foreign goods? How can the government show its initial intention to protect real industries and set an example for the people to happily use domestic goods? This is what the Association members are surprised and puzzled by regarding the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau's purchase of Red Dragon cement. Furthermore, since the consolidated cement tax was increased from 6 jiao to 1.20 yuan per barrel, merchants were already worried about the increased burden. Fortunately, the government also increased import duties, so domestic cement was somewhat protected and the country's tax revenue increased. Now, if state-owned railways openly purchase foreign goods and create an example of duty-free imports, the tariff protection will become a mere formality, and domestic manufacturers will not be able to survive under this heavy tax. As a result, the country's tax revenue will also be affected. Moreover, the Association believes that foreign goods shipped to China are mostly of a dumping nature, and their selling prices in China are often reduced to below cost or below the selling prices in their countries of origin. Cement is particularly prone to dumping. Since the government increased import duties, the amount of imports has decreased. Last year, imported cement accounted for only about 50% of the amount in 1933. However, considering the production of various factories, it has not yet reached its maximum capacity. It is clear that this industry still needs the joint support of the government and society. If the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau is allowed to import Red Dragon cement duty-free, it will remove the barriers and help promote dumping, which is not the government's original intention in revising the tariff regulations, and may be ridiculed by foreigners. The Association witnesses the domestic production industry declining day by day, and the national economy in a precarious state. If the somewhat successful cement industry is not urgently requested to be protected by the government, it is feared that a major disaster will occur in the future, leading to mutual destruction, and the society and national economy will inevitably be affected. The Association feels a sense of crisis and dares not remain silent. Therefore, we dare to lay out the facts and earnestly request your review and approval (instruct the Ministry of Railways) to order the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau to use domestic cement for all future needs, and that your ministry should stop issuing duty-free licenses for imported cement in the future, and also issue a general order to its subordinates to purchase domestic cement as much as possible for construction projects to prevent losses and maintain the real economy, which would be in the public interest. Furthermore, the Association was reorganized from the former United Cement Factory of China, and has been reported to the Shanghai Special City Party Department for approval and registration, and is currently applying for registration. This is stated together. The person submitting the petition is the United Cement Industry Association of China.</p>

This measure will be implemented from April 1 of this year.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Association Rectifies Market Prices</h3>
<p>All Industries in the City Stop Business for One Day</p>
<p>Meeting to Discuss Increasing Market Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association, in view of the fact that the city's commerce has been affected by the sluggish market for many years and surrounded by the dumping policies of foreign goods, resulting in frequent price drops and business declines, has now reached the point where factories are stopping work, going out of business, and going bankrupt. If this continues without rectification, the future will be unthinkable. The Association, learning from past mistakes and to maintain the original position of the emerging domestic industry, recently convened all industries in the city to discuss remedial measures. It was resolved that all industries in the city would stop business for one day on the 21st of this month and stop transporting goods to customers. On that day, all industries and factories were convened to discuss the issue of increasing market prices. The details of the meeting are listed below: (1) The meeting was held as scheduled, and Gan Dounan was elected as the chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting and the resolutions of the previous session. (2) Regarding how to increase market prices for this year's opening, it was resolved that ordinary goods should be slightly increased according to the past selling prices of each factory, and colored goods should be increased by each factory at its discretion. (3) Regarding how to handle any violations or disruptions of the above price increase resolution, which was signed and approved by all industries, it was resolved that any factory (whether a member or not) that violates the above resolution should be reported to the higher authorities for strict punishment in accordance with industry regulations. (4) The date for the implementation of the price increase was decided, and it was resolved that it would be announced in the newspaper and strictly implemented from the 22nd of this month. (5) Regarding how to handle contracts previously signed between factories and customers, it was resolved that all contracts would be terminated and invalidated from the date of the announcement. If any disputes arise, they can be reported to the Association for assistance.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Theft Case in the Diamond District</h3>
<p>An Elegant Young Lady Whose Dress Does Not Resemble That of a Pickpocket</p>
<p>Taking Off Her Coat Revealed a Brooch That Could Not Possibly Be Pawned</p>
<p>Pang Zhenglong, a woman from Anhui, is in her early twenties and has a strong physique, resembling a great man. She once studied at the Anhui Higher Normal School and now resides at No. 15 Shude Lane, Yaozhu Jiao Road, French Concession. At 5:45 PM on the 28th of last month, the woman went alone to the Shanghai Old Goods Store at No. 598 Nanjing Road, stating that she wanted to buy a necklace. The shop assistant, seeing that she was dressed elegantly, considered her to be a young lady from a good family and immediately treated her attentively. He took out necklaces from the cabinet for her to choose from. The woman took off her black coat and placed it next to the cabinet, examining the necklace around her neck, touching it with her hand, and discussing the price. After a long time, she still found the price too high. She returned the necklace, took her coat, and left without a word. That evening, the store checked the items in the cabinet and discovered that a</p>
<p>diamond brooch</p>
<p>worth 220 yuan had disappeared. Since the woman had placed her coat next to the cabinet, they suspected that she might be responsible. They reported this to the Old Gate Police Station. Because they did not know the woman's whereabouts, they were unable to investigate. At about 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, the woman went to the Shanghai Old Hairpin Store again. Her clothes were even more glamorous, wearing a green woolen Western-style coat, a red Western-style skirt, yellow stockings, and yellow leather shoes, which attracted even more attention. The shop assistant saw her gracefully enter the store. Although old suspicions resurfaced, he had no evidence and could not ask her about it. He still treated her attentively. After the woman left, he immediately sent a friend to follow her, directly to No. 936 Xiafei Road, French Concession, to the</p>
<p>Hong Sheng Pawnshop</p>
<p>The woman entered the pawnshop and took out a pawn ticket from her bag. The pawnshop clerk thought she was redeeming an item. After examining the pawn ticket, he took out a diamond brooch. The woman claimed that she was not redeeming it, but wanted to increase the loan amount. The pawnshop clerk estimated that since it had been pawned for 150 yuan previously, he could only add 26 yuan. He asked the woman if she agreed. The woman nodded. At this time, the friend who had followed her from the Shanghai Old Goods Store had identified the brooch as the original item. He immediately used the telephone nearby to report to the Old Gate Police Station, which dispatched detective Wang Shanqing to rush to the pawnshop to arrest her. However, the woman had already disappeared like a yellow crane. Detective Wang then reported to the French Concession Police, who dispatched additional detectives to assist in the arrest. At 6:30 PM, they learned that the woman had returned to her residence after obtaining the loan amount,</p>
<p>accompanied by two young</p>
<p>men, and went to the Huifang Food Company at No. 206 Taisdelang Road to have a meal. They immediately followed and arrested them all and brought them back to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, one of the two men, Zhang Guanjin, and the other, Nong Minnan, both confessed to being university students. The loan amount pawned by the woman was also found on Zhang. The pawned brooch was also recovered. At that time, Pang confessed to stealing the jewelry and pawning it, and said that she and Zhang Nong were classmates and owed Zhang money, so she pawned the item to repay the debt and had no other relationship. The police chief then</p>
<p>released the two men</p>
<p>and sent the woman to jail. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Zhan Liangce conducted the trial. Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, presented the case and requested that the defendant be punished for theft. Judge Zhan felt that the woman's appearance did not resemble that of a pickpocket, but now she had been caught with the stolen goods. According to the police lawyer, the woman had already confessed at the police station. After repeated and detailed questioning about the reasons for the theft, the woman explained the process of the theft and her remorse in detail. She said that her family was wealthy and her father was a member of the upper class and liked antiques and precious jewelry. The first time she passed by the Shanghai Old Goods Store, she went in to inspect because she saw that there were</p>
<p>necklaces for sale</p>
<p>However, because she did not have much money, she did not buy anything. When she returned to her residence, she took off her coat and saw that there was a brooch attached to the inside of the coat. She suddenly remembered that she had placed her coat on the jewelry box at the store. This pin might be from the box. She originally intended to return it immediately, but her close friend Wang Yufeng was ill and hospitalized in the Dahua Hospital and had repeatedly borrowed money for medical expenses, but she had been unable to respond because she had no money. Having obtained this brooch, she took it to the hospital to help people in need. She initially did not tell her friend where the pin came from, and Wang gladly accepted it and asked her to exchange it for cash. However, she was an educated woman and should not have committed this dishonorable act. After thinking about it, she felt</p>
<p>very sorry</p>
<p>and repeatedly wanted to go to the store to explain, but she did not have the courage, so she wanted to go but stopped. Yesterday, she went to the store again and originally intended to confess herself and ask the store to give her some time to raise money to repay it. Unexpectedly, after arriving, the people in the store were very attentive, so it was still difficult for her to speak. She returned in disappointment. On the way, she remembered that she owed Zhang Guanjin 40 yuan, and Zhang was leaving Shanghai today and had come to</p>
<p>demand payment</p>
<p>So she went to the pawnshop again to pawn the item for the money. She had already returned 20 yuan to Zhang. After confessing, she sobbed incessantly. Judge Zhan was lenient because the defendant was a first-time offender. After confessing, she sobbed incessantly. Judge Zhan was lenient because the defendant was a first-time offender and sentenced her to a fine of 50 yuan. The original stolen goods were returned to the owner, who was asked to quickly return them to the defendant. After Pang was fined, her male friend waited outside the courtroom. When he saw her come out, he immediately went forward to comfort her, and she was still crying bitterly. This is truly a rare case.</p>

<h3>Record of the Continued Trial of the Tang Jiapeng Assassination Case, Wang Xinggao</h3>
<p>The Informant Zhao Guangfu Suddenly Changed His Testimony Again</p>
<p>Claiming That Wang Xinggao Had No Connection to This Case</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, a native of Ningbo and former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, also known as A Yu, was suddenly shot and assassinated in front of the Great World at about 1:00 AM on June 18, 1933, and died. At the same time, a pedestrian, Wu Guangcai from Yangzhou, was passing by and was killed by a stray bullet. Two months later, the French Police Special Agency arrested the criminals, Zhang Tinggui, a native of Funing, also known as Zhang Xiaosizi, and Zhao Guangfu, a native of Yangzhou. They were sent to the Second Special Court, which sentenced Zhang to 20 years in prison and Zhao to life imprisonment, both with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The case</p>
<p>was concluded after three trials and sent to prison for execution. Recently, the French Police, based on information from the arrested Zhao Guangfu, dispatched detectives to the Central Hotel on Wuma Road on the evening of December 13 of last year, together with the Old Concession Police, and arrested Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing, who was alleged to be the mastermind of the case. He was transferred to the Second Special Court and prosecuted for the crime of premeditated murder. During the interrogation, Wang stated that he had been working in the political arena and served as a warden in the First Prison of Hubei from August/September 1932 to August 1933. He denied participating in the murder of Tang Jiapeng, etc. After receiving instructions to postpone the investigation and re-interrogate him, the matter was reported in previous newspapers. After the Second Special Court transferred the case to the Hubei Higher Court for investigation, it was not until recently</p>
<p>that a reply was received. The trial judge, Tai Huicui, then scheduled a hearing for yesterday afternoon to summon the witnesses in the case for continued interrogation. At 2:30 PM, Judge Xiong, accompanied by Secretary Tao Zongkan, opened a special court in the Second Court. Lawyer Gu Shouxi represented the Police Affairs Office in court. Three lawyers, including Shen Xingxia and Zhang Qikai, who were hired by the defendant, arrived on time. Many relatives and friends of Wang, both male and female, attended the hearing, making the courtroom crowded and almost impossible to move. After the judge took the bench, he ordered the bailiff to bring the defendant, Wang Xinggao, to the front of the court. He said to Wang, "You said you were working in the First Prison of Hubei. Now, after an investigation by this court to the Hubei Higher Court, according to the reply from the Hubei Higher Court ordering the First Prison to respond, you were working there as an</p>
<p>extra staff member without a signing-in book. This evidence is very weak. Do you have any other strong evidence to present?" Wang replied, "I dare to say that I worked there because there was a signing-in book. Sometimes I signed in, sometimes I didn't. If the warden ordered me to go out to handle other matters, I would not sign in at the prison. If I worked in the prison, I would definitely sign in. I went to Wuchang in June 1932 and took over on August 1st or 2nd. I did not take my wife with me. In February 1933, I returned to Shanghai because my wife was pregnant. I asked for leave to return to Shanghai in August 1933." The judge asked, "You said you came back from Hubei. What evidence do you have?" Wang replied, "I</p>
<p>have a leave slip that can be checked." The judge asked, "You confessed at the police station that you were on vacation in June 1933 when Tang Jiapeng was murdered." Wang replied, "I was in Wuchang at that time. I came back in July." At this point, the court summoned witnesses Wang Zhou Shi (defendant's wife), Wang Chen Shi (defendant's concubine), Ma Baoting, Jiang Huanzhang, Ren Hepei, Cao Aliuyi, Xu Lianzhou, Xu Desheng (former Chief of the Inspection Office of the 26th Army in Zhabei), Qian Yumin (detective of the French Police), and others to court. After questioning each person about their age, address, and occupation, the judge said to each witness, "Today, you have been summoned to court to testify. Except for Zhou and Chen, who are husband and wife with Wang Xinggao and are not required to swear an oath, all witnesses must swear an oath and tell the truth. If you tell a lie, you will be prosecuted for</p>
<p>perjury when it is discovered in the future." Each person agreed and signed the oath, and then was ordered to leave the court and wait for questioning. The judge asked Wang again, "When did you go to work in the First Prison of Hubei?" Wang replied, "I went on June 30, 1932, and took over on August 1st or 2nd. My monthly salary was 16 yuan. On July 25, 1933, I applied for leave because my wife was giving birth and was approved on the 28th. I left that day and worked there for about a year. I never asked for leave before. I also did not go to Shanghai in January 1933." The judge asked, "The police sent detectives to your home to investigate and asked your wife, Zhou, who said that you came back to Shanghai in January and stayed for more than ten days." Wang replied, "No." The judge asked, "According to your confession, you were in Hubei in June 1933. Why did Zhao Guangfu confess that he was drinking tea with you at a teahouse on June 17?" Wang replied, "No, let him provide evidence. He</p>
<p>is slandering me. His other name is Zhao Debiao. In April 1928, he set fire to the Tongtai Pawnshop on Meiyuan Road in Zhabei for robbery. I couldn't catch him, so he bears a grudge and slanders me." The judge asked, "Zhao Guangfu confessed that on June 16, he and Zhou Ermujiang were drinking tea at the Renhe Teahouse, and you were also there. You introduced Sun Er to him and told him that you had a feud with the manager of the Great World and wanted him to kill him (referring to Tang), and promised to give him 100 yuan after the deed was done. Is this true?" Wang replied, "It's really a miscarriage of justice. There is absolutely no such thing." At this point, the court summoned witnesses for questioning. Wang Zhou Shi testified, "Wang Xinggao is my husband. After marrying Chen, he often lives at Chen's place and does not often come to my house. I know that he</p>
<p>went to Hubei in May 1932 and came back in September 1933. When the detective came to ask me, I did not say that my husband came back in January." Wang Chen Shi testified, "I married Wang Xinggao when I was 23 years old. He went to Hubei in May 1932 and came back in August 1933." Ma Baoting testified, "I run a stove shop on Hengfeng Road in Zhabei. I know Wang Xinggao. On August 1, 1933, I met Wang on Sima Road. He asked him and said he had just returned from Hubei. After talking a few words, he left." Ren Hepei testified, "I run a sand and gravel business. I met Wang at the Changle Teahouse. He said he had returned from Hubei." Xu Lianzhou testified, "I run a sand and gravel business." His words were the same as Ren's. Jiang Huanzhang testified, "I opened a</p>
<p>Renhe Teahouse on Hengfeng Road. I have never seen Wang Xinggao come to drink tea." Xu Desheng testified, "I was the Chief of the Inspection Office of the 26th Army in April 1927. Wang Xinggao was a captain in my office. I ordered Captain Wang to arrest Zhao Debiao for the Tongtai Pawnshop fire robbery case. Wang came to my house the day he returned from Hubei. Because I was sick, he left after saying a few words." The judge then ordered Zhao Guangfu to be brought to court. According to his testimony, "While I was in custody, I thought of Wang Jinkui in the Tang murder case, so I hated him for causing me to be wrongly accused. Later, someone said that Wang Jinkui had now changed his name to Wang Xinggao, so I had to investigate and reported it to the police. Now, I am speaking from my conscience. The Wang Xinggao in this case has no connection to the Tang murder case." The judge asked, "Then</p>
<p>why did you still identify him in court last time?" Zhao replied, "I used to have an affair with a Suzhou woman and rented a house to live together. Later, I heard that Wang had taken her and married her as his fourth concubine, so I hated him and accused him, using public office to avenge private revenge. I recognized him in court last time because I had been in custody for a long time and had not seen the light of day, so I was confused and made a mistake. I have known Wang since 1929, but I don't call him that." Zhang Tinggui, also known as Xiaosizi, was brought to court and testified, "I don't know Wang Xinggao. I have only heard of Wang Jinkui, but I don't know him." At this point, it was late. The court ordered the clerk to read the minutes and then ordered a postponement to March 6 in the afternoon for further interrogation of the witnesses in the case. The defendant was still remanded in custody. When the court adjourned, it was already six o'clock, and the lights of thousands of homes were lit.</p>

<h3>Two Cases of Robbery</h3>
<p>Aidotuo Road: At around 6 PM yesterday, at a residence with the address No. 4, 15th Lane, on Aidotuo Road, near Danshui Road, four bandits suddenly barged in. Three of them were armed with handguns, and one was unarmed. They first guarded the front and back doors, threatening and preventing anyone from making a sound, and assigned bandits to watch over the people. They then forced the residents to hand over the keys to chests and cabinets, proceeded to rob the place, overturning boxes and emptying baskets, searching everywhere thoroughly. After about half an hour, they left with their loot. Afterward, the victim tallied the losses, which amounted to over 500 taels of silver in cash, foreign currency, and jewelry. He immediately reported the incident to the police station in charge, requesting an investigation and pursuit of the criminals.</p>
<p>Guangxi Road: At a certain coal store located at No. 128 Guangxi Road, around 9 PM last night, just as they were preparing to close for the day, five robbers suddenly appeared. Only two of them were armed with handguns. After entering the store, they immediately shouted at everyone to stop and not move, and assigned one robber to guard them. They then ordered the owner to hand over the key to the cash box, opened the box, and stole all the cash and foreign currency inside, totaling 170 yuan. After obtaining the loot, the robbers fled. By the time the police arrived, the robbers were long gone. The owner then went to the police station in charge to report the incident, requesting an investigation and pursuit of the criminals.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Climbs Over Roof to Report Crime</h3>
<p>Three Robbers Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>The robbers Zhang Xuewen from Haizhou, Zhou Yushan from Qingjiang, and Gu Yinghan from Siyang, along with their gang, armed with weapons, went to Han Youjin's silk shop, a native of Yangzhou, located at No. 7 Tongle Lane, Huasheng Road, at 6:25 PM the day before yesterday. Zhang pulled out a gun, and aimed at Han, threatening and preventing him from making a sound, demanding that he hand over his valuables. Zhou and Gu retreated to keep watch. At that time, apprentices Yao Defu and Yao Changgen were quite alert and climbed from the balcony on the upper floor onto the roof, jumped down into the neighboring houses, and secretly went out to report to the Yulin Road police station and the reserve team. Immediately, Chinese and foreign detectives arrived and found the main gate locked. They entered through the back door, first arresting Zhang, seizing a handgun, and five bullets. Subsequently, Zhou and Gu were arrested nearby. All three were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Li Zhishan stated the previous events and requested an extension for investigation of the case. He presented the gun and bullets for inspection. When questioned by the defendants, their statements were evasive. Judge Xiao Xieffen ordered them to be remanded in custody for further review at a later date.</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting of the China Corporation</h3>
<p>The American China Corporation held its ninth annual shareholders' meeting at the company's office in Shanghai on February 20, 1935. The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Mr. Sadarley, who announced the following to the shareholders: "According to the established schedule, the time has come, and the shareholders and their representatives present represent a sufficient number of shares to meet the legal quorum. I would like to ask the company secretary to first read the notice of the annual shareholders' meeting." The secretary read: "Pursuant to the instructions of the company's board of directors, the China Corporation will hold its annual shareholders' meeting at 4:30 PM on Wednesday, February 20, 1935, at the company's office at No. 290 Sichuan Road, Shanghai. All stock transfer registration matters will be temporarily suspended from February 11 to February 20. All letters of proxy from shareholders must be submitted to the company's office before 5 PM on February 19 to be effective." Secretary Adam then reported: "1934 was the most difficult year I have ever experienced in Shanghai, especially for the real estate business. During the first nine months of last year, there was abundant money in the market, and interest rates were low, making it extremely difficult for our company to conduct mortgage business. It was even more difficult to collect commissions on this business. Unexpectedly, the financial market suddenly underwent a serious change, leading to a situation where money was not available for borrowing. In previous financial emergencies, it was still possible to borrow money at higher interest rates, but today it is not the case. Money has become impossible to access, and the value of collateral or the level of interest rates are insufficient as conditions for borrowing. As the saying goes, 'Things reach an extreme and then revert.' I hope that this is also the case for Shanghai today. This is because an article on the value of Shanghai real estate, published in the Economic and Commercial Gazette on January 9, 1935, shows that the value of Shanghai real estate has made considerable progress compared to other major cities around the world. Since real estate has been the guarantor of all property in the past, it must still maintain its primary position in future investment activities. This is what I am convinced of. Last year, the buying and selling of real estate in Shanghai was generally limited to special purposes, so the amount of transactions was very small. Given the general business situation and the current economic panic, I believe that the profits our company has earned last year are indeed satisfactory. All the directors of our company unanimously recommend setting aside a reserve fund and paying a dividend of one dime and five cents per share in accordance with American commercial law. This is because in the current situation and in the uncertain months of future market changes, it would be unwise to pay out dividends in excess of what is absolutely necessary. In short, although the current market is full of great dangers, we are convinced that once the market stabilizes, Shanghai's future will be optimistic, after we have exerted our best efforts in the face of all difficulties and maintained credit in Shanghai's real estate business. Before discussing the resolutions, if any shareholders have any questions, I am willing to do my best to answer them in detail." Resolution 1: "I propose to pass the 1934 business report and settlement." Mr. Li Wei seconded the motion. Passed. Resolution 2: "I propose to dispose of the remaining balance of 797,339 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen listed in the profit and loss statement in the following manner: pay a dividend of 1 dime and 5 cents per share, totaling 75,000 yuan; establish and allocate a reserve fund of 500,000 yuan; and allocate the remaining balance of 222,339 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen; totaling 797,339 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen." Mr. Spier Monde seconded the motion. Passed. Resolution 3: "Mr. Ronis and Mr. Lin Yuting have voluntarily resigned from their positions as directors but are still eligible for candidacy." Proposed by Mr. Zhong Kecheng and seconded by Mr. Li Wei, they should still be recommended as directors for the next term. Passed. Resolution 4: "Proposed by Mr. Adam and seconded by Mr. Lin Yuting, we propose to hire Yi Maoli Accountants as the company's auditors for 1935." Passed.</p>
<h3>Trafficking Ring Cracked</h3>
<p>Wang Runhe and Zhang Faxiang, Chinese detectives from the Hongkou Police Station, learned that No. 105 North Jiangxi Road was a human trafficking center. At around 7 PM the day before yesterday, they secretly went there with foreign detectives, arrested the main culprit, Cantonese woman Ma A'mei, along with accomplices Jiang Yongqing from Tongzhou, Qiao Wengui from Jiangbei, Cantonese woman Wang Chenshi, and others, as well as opium smoking paraphernalia, and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the defendant Ma A'mei had previously opened a brothel on Peng Road. In 1931, she had Jiang Yongqing abduct a girl named Wang Caigen from Wuxi to work as a prostitute at her place, for 170 yuan, for a term of four years. Last winter, when the term expired, she returned to her hometown. Recently, Jiang went to Wuxi again and had Wang come to Shanghai, staying at Gao Sanmei's place, a small sister, at No. 9 Jing'an Temple Road, intending to go to Ma A'mei's house again to continue her career as a divine maiden for profit. Jiang Yongqing, in collusion with Qiao Wengui, had abducted a six-year-old girl, Jin Di, and a thirteen-year-old girl, A'mei, both from Liyang, to Shanghai on January 22 of this year, and Wang Chenshi sold them to a certain Cantonese woman as adopted daughters for a total of 85 yuan. The suspects admitted to this at the police station. He requested an extension for a detailed investigation of the case. Then, Chinese and foreign detectives reported the course of the case investigation. Judge Xiao Xieffen questioned the defendants, whose statements were evasive. According to the testimony of women Wang Caigen and Gao Sanmei, the court ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>

Unexpectedly, the South China region continues to purchase 1,000 boxes of large-sized bottles, which must be delivered within two weeks.

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan's Lecture on Shanghai's School Education (4)</h3>
<p>(II) We not only hope that all school-age children have the opportunity to attend primary school, but we also want to find ways to provide educational opportunities for illiterate adults. This "adult education" is called "adult education" in foreign countries. "Adult education" in foreign countries is remedial education for those older people who lack specialized knowledge. These people have all received primary education in their childhood. They say that losing education at an older age is definitely not like our people who, when they get older, do not even know how to read. Perhaps some countries also have illiterate older people, but such people are always in the minority. We should always find ways to teach the generally illiterate older people in our country to read a little, even if it is just a few words, it is better than not knowing any. We usually call this kind of education "mass education," but as I see it, the four words "mass education" are somewhat inappropriate. Why? Since it is called "mass education," then all the masses should be included. As far as the "masses" are concerned, not only are older people who are illiterate the masses, but also primary school students, middle school students, and university students are also the masses. All education is received by the masses. In reality, it should still be called "adult education," but for the time being, we don't need to worry about this name. It is also acceptable to continue using "mass education," but it should be divided into adult and children's departments, targeting illiterate adults and children. So, what is the situation of "adult education," that is, "mass education," in Shanghai? I can briefly report it. I won't talk about the "mass schools" established privately in Shanghai. The municipal "mass schools" have now been held for thirteen sessions, each session graduating in four months. They have been held thirteen times in a row. In the first session, there were twenty schools. In the second session, there were thirty schools. In the third session, there were thirty-three schools. In the fourth session, there were thirty-five schools. In the fifth session, there were fifty-two schools. In the sixth session, there were fifty-two schools. In the seventh session, there were fifty-four schools. In the eighth session, there were thirty-five schools. In the ninth session, there were forty-three schools. In the tenth session, there were forty-six schools. In the eleventh session, there were fifty-one schools. In the twelfth session, there were fifty schools. The schools in the twelfth session will not graduate until January 1935. The thirteenth session held fifteen "higher mass schools." These students will not graduate until March 1935. Except for the student numbers in the thirteenth session, which have not been statistically compiled, the total number of students, both male and female, in the previous twelve sessions is 23,336. Because the books and other supplies of the "mass schools" are given to the students, they often stop coming after studying for only a few days. Therefore, some students stop coming to school before graduating. As a result, the number of students who completed four months and graduated in the twelve sessions is only 10,126, averaging less than 1,000 students per session. Up to the eleventh session, the expenses used by the "mass schools" totaled 52,013 yuan, averaging about 5,000 yuan per session, which means that each graduate costs 5 yuan. The expenses used to run "mass schools" are much less compared to primary schools. Moreover, the funds we use to promote "mass education" are mostly from the surplus money from running primary and secondary school education, so there is actually not much special funding for promoting "mass education." In short, for the generally illiterate older people, we want to enable them to know some basic characters and understand some common knowledge. This is the minimum simple knowledge that everyone should know. However, if we extrapolate based on the progress ratio of running mass schools in the past, to provide literacy education to all one million (approximate number) adult illiterates in Shanghai, we need to run another one thousand sessions of mass schools. At four months per session, it will take four thousand months, which is equivalent to more than three hundred years. In terms of funding, each graduate of a mass school costs 5 yuan of public funds, then the literacy funding for these one million illiterates would reach 5 million yuan. Isn't that shocking? It can be seen that using this old method of running mass education to carry out universal education is really laughable. We must find other ways for this poor China and poor Shanghai.</p>
<p>Originally, "elementary education" focuses on teaching children basic characters and common knowledge, and "mass education" also focuses on teaching adults basic characters and common knowledge. Therefore, these two types of schools should be interconnected, and our future approach will be to use large, medium, and small schools as the foundation for promoting "mass education." All primary and secondary school teachers should participate in promoting "mass education." At the same time, we should also encourage university students, middle school students, and older primary school students to do this work together. In addition to studying themselves, they should take some time to teach illiterate people. In this way, both learning and teaching will not only improve their own studies, but also serve as a way to repay society. If we take a look at all the students in the city, there are currently more than 150,000 primary school students. If we find one older student out of ten primary school students, there will be 15,000 people. Add to that 32,000 middle school students and 12,000 university students, and the total comes to 59,000 people, almost 60,000 people. Add to that about 12,000 faculty and staff from all levels of schools. If these 60,000 students and 12,000 faculty and staff all make a vow to be responsible for teaching three "illiterates" to read this semester, whether they are teaching villagers or the old maids at home, anyone who is illiterate can be taught. In this way, after half a year, 72,000 people can teach 210,000 people and eliminate 210,000 "illiterates." This is definitely not wishful thinking. The reason we are suffering now is because we have not done it. If we all make a determination to do it, taking a few hours each week or some time each day to do this is not a difficult task. This is not an impossible task like "carrying Mount Tai to cross the North Sea." Everyone is not doing it because they don't want to, not because they can't. If we can do it according to this calculation, we can teach 210,000 people in half a year, and 400,000 people in a year. Naturally, it will not take two or three years to eliminate all the "illiterates" in Shanghai. Moreover, we must also have a method. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, whoever teaches a literate person should make an agreement with them. We teach you without taking your money, and you should also make a vow that after you learn to read, you will voluntarily be responsible for teaching one or two illiterate people. In this way, if we teach 210,000 people in the first semester, by the second semester, we will teach more than just 210,000 people, because if each of the 210,000 newly literate people in the first semester also goes to teach one more person, wouldn't we be able to teach 400,000 people in the second semester? If we do it like this, we will definitely be able to eliminate "illiteracy." However, this method requires everyone to vigorously promote it and "put it into practice." Don't think of it as a fantasy. Even if we don't succeed completely, it's still better than not doing it. If you think about it, I was always taught by my parents and teachers. Now I am fulfilling my duty to teach three people to read, which is also a way to repay society. Moreover, a few literacy primers don't cost much money. Even if I buy three copies and give them to the students, it is very important. China is a "poor country," so we must "calculate frugally." Just because people are poor, does that mean they don't do anything? We must talk about efficiency, use less money, and achieve great results. I sincerely hope that people who have already received education and students who are still in school, regardless of age, can all make a vow to contribute their strength to "adult education," and it is best to start doing it now. Don't wait, thinking that if you don't do it today, there is still tomorrow. When January 1st of next year comes, thinking that there are still 365 days, you can't wait "until next year." Moreover, the world situation is changing unpredictably. We cannot wait, nor can we afford to wait.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will ask, the things you are lecturing on today are all very superficial. Even if young children know some basic common sense and older illiterates know a few characters, what great use is there? People can invent airplanes and fly them, and people can invent poison gas and manufacture guns and cannons. If we don't pay attention to these issues, won't we still suffer? Therefore, a "problem" arises. Some people say that "specialized education" is the most important and that "primary education" and "adult education" should both be categorized under "universal education." As a result, China has had two schools of thought in the past. As I just said, it seems like I am standing on the "universal education" line. There are also many famous scholars who seem to look down on "universal education," thinking that "specialized talents" are important. But my meaning is not that we don't need "specialized talents," but that "universal education" is particularly important at this time. This is from a comparative perspective. I remember that from the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic of China, these two opinions were debated a lot.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Jiaoxin)</p>
<p>Whenever the night before it snows, the drunkards always want to invite two or three close friends to have a few drinks. Bai Juyi's line, "Late, the sky threatens snow, could we drink a cup or no?" is indeed a vivid portrayal; but those who do not drink cannot appreciate its beauty.</p>
<p>Women always want to manage their husbands so that they are completely obedient, obeying their wives' commands; but they absolutely do not want their sons to listen to their wives. Women always say how bad their daughters-in-law are, but their daughters are always good no matter what; if they marry unhappily and there is discord between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, then of course it is the mother-in-law's fault. So women's psychology is extremely contradictory.</p>
<h3>Prison</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>The wounds on my legs deepen, the shackles tighten; the wounds on my back increase, the contact with the whip becomes more frequent;</p>
<p>Sweat washes the long hair on my pale head, my beard grows full on my sallow face, outside there is a free world—but it is only separated by a solid iron window.</p>
<p>This little poem is what I used to lament prisoners. When a person unfortunately falls into prison, his happiness is completely deprived!</p>
<p>But although life inside the iron window is miserable, can the world outside the iron window be considered free? In comparison, there are no shackles, no beatings with whips; but countless invisible and heavy shackles, one by one invisible and poisonous whips, are all over this turbulent era, attacking all of humanity without mercy.</p>
<p>Look: those who commit suicide for economic reasons, are they not sacrificing themselves in the prison of money? Those who take their own lives for marriage, are they not destroyed in the prison of love? Those who are pessimistic about life because of superstition, are they not ruined in the prison of religion? ... People fall, suffer, scream, and struggle in various prisons; therefore, the boundary between tangible and intangible prisons is very small!</p>
<p>Prisoners in this vast prison! Concentrate all your enthusiasm and ambition, and create a truly free and happy new world.</p>
<h3>Youtiao Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Yan He</p>
<p>Previously, I read Mr. Wang Shaba's "Youtiao Anecdotes," which said, "I happened to hear a comedian on the radio singing a song about dabing and youtiao: Dabing youtiao, dabing youtiao, blow wheat flowers, blow wheat flowers,..." After checking, this song was actually the song "Down with the Powers, Down with the Powers, Eliminate the Warlords, Eliminate the Warlords, the National Revolution is Successful, the National Revolution is Successful, Let's Sing Together! Let's Sing Together!" which was widely sung after the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived in Shanghai in 1927. At that time, someone imitated this song and created "Dabing Youtiao, Dabing Youtiao, Crispy Youtiao, Crispy Youtiao, Three Coppers a Piece, Three Copper Coins a Piece, Cheap or Not? Cheap or Not?" These two songs were both popular at the time, and even the common people could sing them. It didn't need a "certain comedian" to "break new ground."</p>
<p>The three words "blow wheat flowers" are the most egregious invention. Are they drawing on Du Fu's poem, "Fine wheat falls with light flowers," or Duan Maotang's saying, "North of the river, wheat blooms like a painting, a yang object, so eating it strengthens the body: south of the river, wheat blooms at night, a yin object, so eating too much harms people," as the basis for wheat flowers? But what does the word "blow" mean? Undoubtedly, this is the "sesame oil fried dough twists" and "crispy youtiao" that street vendors are selling.</p>
<p>Youtiao is also known as Korean sticks. These names are only seen in colloquial language, and there is very little basis for them in books. Rural women insert a silver needle into their hair bun, and the needle is wound into a youtiao shape, which is called a youtiao needle. There are also silver bracelets worn on the arm, wound into a youtiao shape, which are also called youtiao bracelets. As for the word "crispy" in "crispy youtiao," it is an adjective used by the seller.</p>
<p>In the past, someone imitated the poem "Peach Blossom Face" to praise youtiao, saying: "Last year today, I passed this door, Pitted faces knead youtiao opposite each other, the pitted face doesn't know where it went, the youtiao is still fried in the oil pot." It is truly irresistibly amusing.</p>
<p>Also, the Fujian Miscellaneous Records says: "What the Fujianese call youguo is the youzhuokuai of Hangzhou. The Fuzhou people also call it youzhuokuai, while the Xinghua people only call it zhuokuai." According to this, it is the commonly known youzhaokuai.</p>
<h3>The Three Giants of World Politics</h3>
<p>— Zuo</p>
<h3>A Quick Sketch of the Life of Shanghai Beggars</h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>Beggars in Shanghai are not only not decreasing, but are increasing day by day; perhaps this is because their life is idyllic?</p>
<p>Indeed, the sky is their quilt, the ground is their bed. They lie down and have a dream, carefree and incomparable. As the saying goes, "Begging for three years, I don't want to be an official." The idyllic life of beggars can be said to be perfectly described!</p>
<p>Beggars in this chilly season are no longer happy to wrap themselves in burlap sacks, hug messy thatch, torn paper, and sleep in the small alleys under the overhanging buildings, eating the northwest wind with their cold friends. Because their daily income is about two to three thousand cash, they will also borrow inns to go to; these inns are concentrated in the French Concession area, like behind Gongguan Road, north of Baxianqiao, Dongxinqiao, and the old Beimen area, there are inns that specialize in beggars' business? The rooms in these inns are not like the rooms in large hotels, with water heaters, sofas, tables, and chairs...fully equipped, they are all rooms divided into small cubicles, just enough for one person to sleep in, commonly called "pigeon cages." The price of this "pigeon cage" style room is generally from more than ten copper coins to more than thirty copper coins per night. Several old hands even smoke opium and play poker at night. When they are hungry, they order a few plates of egg fried rice to eat. This is their usual thing and is not surprising.</p>
<p>When it dawns, general seasoned beggar, with a cigarette butt clipped in between his fingers, walks along and asks for alms from pedestrians. They also often shout "catching pigs," isn't this a novel approach? There are also beggars who beg from all kinds of families. If they see the door of a house open, they will visit, and they will say in their mouths: "It's been a long time since I've come!" This is probably meant to be polite?</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Inept at Flattery, Seeking Help Meets Rebuff; Unable to Return, Misled by Exaggerated Claims</p>
<p>"Small-footed woman"—these four words clearly reached her ears, and she couldn't help but interject, laughing: "What does that matter? Even though we have small feet, we can do anything. If I were to kneel on the ground and work, you big-footed women wouldn't do as much as I do." That woman came from the East and was steeped in civilized education. People didn't call her "Madam," but "Mr." or "Ms." No one had ever addressed her with "you" and "we" in that way. Instantly, her face turned red, and she waved her hand towards the door: "Go away! You don't understand any manners. I don't need someone like you. Go away!" After saying that, she waved her hand twice more. Although Madam Hu didn't understand her words, she understood the repeated "go away." Since she was being told to go away, the promise of work was off the table. Her heart had been full of hope, believing that meeting the owner would provide an opportunity to eat her fill, but she didn't expect that the Western-style woman would have such a temper, turning red in the face after only a few words. She didn't know what she had done wrong, but she couldn't bear losing the opportunity to work immediately, so she said: "Oh! Weren't you looking for help?" As she spoke, she felt somewhat flustered. Naturally, her two feet were unsteady, and her body swayed back and forth. The woman waved her hand again: "Get out of here! Who needs a useless person like you to work?" When Cheng Zhiqian saw the woman lose her temper at first, he didn't really mind. But now that she was telling the woman to "get out," even though the poor woman couldn't resist, her impolite manner embarrassed even the introducer. He reddened and said to Yueying: "Your mother really doesn't know how to speak; she can't get a welcome out of anyone she meets. Let's help your mother go back." (139)</p>
<h3>Records of Fleeting Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Furthermore, to our delight, the person who arrived to tidy up before us had also noticed the stage. As a result, the pillars on the stage had already been repainted, and the flying dragons carved on the pillars had been uniformly coated with a layer of gold paint, dazzlingly bright and eye-catching. Now, with a few embroidered silk curtains hung up, the stage instantly had a fresh look. It was like a country bumpkin putting on a new gown; while his inherent rustic and foolish demeanor couldn't be completely hidden, at least it wouldn't be so offensive to the eye! The Empress Dowager nodded and smiled, indicating that the stage could still be used. So, could our opera begin? Not quite yet! To start the opera, the Empress Dowager herself had to give the order. No one dared to act without authorization. At the moment, the Empress Dowager was enthusiastically telling us how Yang Silang was lost in a foreign land, how he married Princess Iron Mirror, how he longed for his family, how the princess stole the order for him, and how he crossed the border… She was determined not to let us stop halfway through any of the details, so the opera was put on hold. It wasn't until she finished telling the story of how Yang Silang returned too late, causing Empress Xiao to find out and almost have him executed, but Princess Iron Mirror saved him, that the story finally ended.</p>
<p>Once she stopped talking, everyone knew that the opera was about to begin. She didn't need to say anything; she just waved her hand, and a eunuch rushed to the edge of the stage like a flying arrow, loudly announcing: "The Old Buddha has decreed: Start the opera!" In an instant, the stage was filled with the sounds of gongs and drums, and scene after scene unfolded. Even while the opera was being performed, the Empress Dowager wouldn't be quiet, constantly telling us about the various customs and anecdotes of the opera. In reality, it was because she had seen so many operas that she couldn't sit quietly and watch peacefully anymore. (250)</p>
<p>Itinerary</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Ueno Zoo in Japan (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The Ueno Zoo in Ueno Park is the largest in Japan. Not only in Japan, but perhaps also the largest in East Asia. For a ticket price of 15 cents, you can spend the whole day there and see animals from all over the world on display.</p>
<p>In the section for land mammals, there are buffaloes, camels, mules, horses, etc. Among them, there is a brown steed with a sign saying that it had been to Fengtian, Harbin, and Inner Mongolia, participating in races and traveling over 1,800 li. Foxes, wolves, bears, etc., which are more ferocious, are all kept in iron cages. Various kinds of deer, sheep, and pigs are only surrounded by short iron railings.</p>
<p>Two Indian gray elephants are the largest figures in the zoo, and their residence occupies a large Western-style house. During the day, they can also go to the nearby open space for a walk. They have no tusks. They often stretch their long noses out of the iron cage, soliciting food from the audience. In front of each animal, there is a wooden box containing a pot of food, such as sweet potatoes and radishes. The box lid is labeled "One cent per pot." Many children throw food to the animals. Although there is no one supervising, they can put the money in the small cabinet properly.</p>
<p>There are few natural stones in Ueno Park, but animals like to live in the wild. So they use artificial stones to create high mountains and steep peaks, just like the artificial mountains in our country, which are quite realistic. The mountain cave where dozens of monkeys live has peaks three or four zhang high, and waterfalls of tap water flow gurglingly, like the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in "Journey to the West."</p>
<p>Polar bears, seals, and sea lions are animals from the Arctic Ocean, so there are seawater pools next to them to make their lives comfortable. Hippos live in indoor swimming pools with hot water supplied by radiators. Because it has been very cold these past few days, the two hippos are always hiding at the bottom of the water, only sticking their nostrils out of the water every 20 or 30 minutes to get air.</p>
<p>Various exotic birds are separated by wire cages that are two or three zhang high. Inside, there are evergreen trees for them to perch on, so they are not in a state of freedom. All waterfowl have small ponds where they can swim, so their feathers are very clean and shiny. However, the tail feathers of some white peacocks and bluebirds are stained with mud, and they are broken, with only a few left.</p>
<p>The most difficult to feed are of course tropical animals. The climate in Japan is colder than in Shanghai, China, so they spare no effort to build warm rooms and use radiators to provide heat. Various beautiful little birds occupy a large room. The method of raising fish is very special. The tanks are made of glass to prevent water leakage. The bottom of the tanks is covered with fine sand and pebbles, and stones with moss growing on them. Submerged aquatic plants are also planted, so that various kinds of fish can live comfortably. The glass tanks are built into the wall, and light is shone down from above, so that viewers can clearly see the fish swimming back and forth in the seaweed. They also use mechanical ingenuity to keep the water in the tanks constantly flowing, and the water volume is neither too much nor too little.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The Central Bank Entered the Spot Gold Market, and the Market Sentiment Improved</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Was Ordinary, with a Large Amount Released</p>
<p>The Upward Trend Failed to Fully Manifest</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's sentiment began to improve, with prices repeatedly rising above the ten-yuan mark. However, due to the ordinary foreign exchange market and significant arbitrage by the Dalian gang, as well as profit-taking by major long positions, the upward trend remained difficult to sustain. The Central Bank entered the spot market, resulting in a stable outcome. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw London rise and the US remain flat. The Montevideo forward silver price slightly increased. Foreign exchange rates were ordinary. London spot gold fell by half a penny. In off-exchange pre-market trading, initial bids were 0.23 yuan, then rose to above 0.24 yuan, still slightly lower than the previous day's closing. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with both the British pound and the US dollar rising, and the Customs Gold Unit falling by 0.013 yuan. The gold price was lowered to 935.4 yuan. Fuchang, Dafa, Yong, and others sold bars at high prices, leading to a decline. After the opening, sentiment improved, and buying interest increased, gradually rising. Banks lacked the appetite to sell, and the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened, breaking through the ten-yuan mark. Major players competed to buy, further pushing up prices. However, as banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, and arbitrage activities increased, the upward trend was hindered and gradually fell back to within the ten-yuan mark. At this time, sentiment remained stable, and buyers continued to maintain their positions at lower prices, with many reversals. Sassoon was willing to sell foreign exchange, but found no counterparties, and the situation gradually became sluggish. Later, as Sassoon repeatedly sold, the foreign exchange market turned hard, and sentiment became timid. Major players and arbitrageurs rushed to sell bars, and retail investors flocked to close positions, leading to a sharp decline, once approaching the 900-yuan mark. Sentiment had turned chaotic. At this moment, there were frequent ups and downs. Unexpectedly, banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, and buyers returned to action. The supply of gold was tight, and sellers lacked momentum, finally resulting in an improvement. The afternoon close saw a bullish trend. The after-market opened steadily. The foreign exchange market was ordinary, and arbitrage remained possible, leading to a brief decline. However, due to improved sentiment and reduced reports of Indian silver, and the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu throwing out US dollars, prices rose despite multiple trades, gradually breaking through the ten-yuan mark. Many major long positions took profits, and there were still pullbacks after the highs. When the Central Bank stepped in to buy spot gold, the upward trend resumed, breaking through the ten-yuan mark. However, sellers continued to trickle out, and there were frequent movements after the highs, making it difficult to sustain. The day's fluctuations were quite rapid, with significant ups and downs. The trend seemed to be improving. Below is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 902.8 yuan, up 2.1 yuan from the previous closing. It then reached 2.5 yuan. Fuyu, Xianghe, Yuanyi, Hengyu, Chang, Dayi, Fengyong, Yongli, Huixiang, Yuanchangyong, and others immediately bought, rising to 6.8 yuan.

Dafayong, Yongli, Hengyu, Fuan, Huixiang, Fuxingyong, Qianchangxiang, and others successively bought, pushing the price to 15 yuan. Knowing in advance that HSBC's posted rates for British pounds and US dollars would remain unchanged had little impact. Citibank sold March US dollars at 93.75, Dafayong, Yuanyi, Fuxingyong, Wanxing, Hengyu, and others sold to 1.5 yuan, with slight struggles. After entering the market, McCallum came out with April US dollars at 75, and April shillings at 0.0625 were difficult to sell.

Banque Franco-Chinoise sold March shillings at 25, Hengyu Yifengyong Dafayong took profits, falling to 6.5 yuan. Yingxiang Dadecheng, although advancing to 7.8 yuan, Sassoon was willing to sell April US dollars at 8125 and July shillings at 625, and then sold June shillings at 9375. Sentiment was greatly weakened, Wanxing Hengyu Hengxing Bingxing Dafayong Yuanmaoyong, and others sold to 4 yuan. Hengyu took advantage of the low prices to advance to 5.5 yuan. Yongli Hengyu took profits, retreating to 4 yuan. Hanhang Hengyu Fuyu Yuanyi, and others successively advanced to 7 yuan. The silver parity tax remained unchanged, and the market traded sideways. Then, Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, Sheng Daxiang, Feng Fu'an, Hengxing Dadecheng took profits one after another, retail investors panicked, and the price fell to 0.7 yuan. Hengyu Fuchang took advantage of the low prices to advance to 2.3 yuan. Fuyu retail investors and Yuanyi and others sold again to 0.5 yuan. Dadecheng Dacheng Hengyu Dafayong Yuanshengyong Yongli and others successively advanced to 3.8 yuan. Dadecheng Hengchangyong took profits.

Korea Huabi bought back March shillings at 3125, gradually rising to 8.3 yuan. Hengyu Yuqingyong Hongxing Dacheng took profits at high prices, retreating to within July. Although Yuanmaoyong Tongyurun advanced, the Dalian gang, Dafayong, Dadecheng Fuyu Changda Qianchangxiang and others sold one after another, retreating to 5.1 yuan. Hengyu handed in bars. The noon close rose to 906.8 yuan. After the closing, Yifengyong Xianghe handed in bars, pushing the price to above 9 yuan.

<p>The after-market opened at 907.7 yuan. Dadecheng Hengyu Qianchangxiang and others sold from 8.1 yuan to 7.2 yuan. Yuqingyong Hengchangyong Fuxingyong still advanced to above 8 yuan. Overseas Chinese sold April shillings at 187.5, Wuyi Yuan Dadecheng Dafayong Hengyu Qingfayong Yuanmaoyong and others successively sold, gradually declining, with many twists and turns along the way, finally falling to within 5.5 yuan. Dadecheng Dafayong Hengyu Qingfayong Tongyurun and others continued to sell, and the sentiment was uncertain. Citibank sold April US dollars at 37 yuan and March shillings at 3125, falling to 3.5 yuan. Yongli Dadecheng Hengyu Changda took advantage of the low prices to advance to 6.3 yuan. Yifengyong Dafayong sold again to 5.1 yuan. Hongxing Yifengyong Futaiheng Hengyu Huixiang and others advanced to 7.8 yuan. Dafayong Yongli Hengyu sold again to 6.3 yuan. The initial report of Indian silver fell by 4.4.3 annas. Dadecheng Yifengyong Yuanmaoyong Chunyong Futaiheng advanced to 8.4 yuan. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu still threw out April US dollars at 37 yuan, and Tongyurun Yicheng followed by selling, falling to 7.2 yuan. No matter how Futaiheng Hengyu Dadecheng Yongli Dafayong all advanced, retail investors strongly supported the price, the Bank of England bought back March shillings at 25, advancing to 11.5 yuan. Hengyu Shunli Wanxing Yuanchangyong Jiatai Dadecheng Tongyi sold bars, gradually falling to 0.82 yuan. Yuanmaoyong Jiatai Yuqingyong and others took advantage of the low prices to advance to 10 yuan. Indian silver rebounded by 1.1 annas. Dadecheng Yuanmaoyong vigorously sold to 7.8 yuan. Rumors that the Central Bank opened 210 spot bars, which was sold by Dadecheng at a price of 900 yuan, boosted sentiment. Yifengyong Futaiheng Changda Hengchangyong Yongli and others competed to buy, rising to 11 yuan. Yuanmaoyong Dadecheng took profits at high prices, retreating to 0.95 yuan. Fuxingyong Yongli still advanced, rising again to 11 yuan. Hengyu Zhaofengchang took profits at high prices, still succumbing to within the ten-yuan mark. Fuxingyong Dadecheng supplied bars again and again, retreating to 8.6 yuan. After trading sideways, the close was 909 yuan. After the closing, Fuxingyong and others continued to sell, retreating to 7.5 yuan. The highest price of the day was 915 yuan, and the lowest price was 900.5 yuan, with fluctuations of 14.5 yuan. As a result, the price rose 8.3 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on the Central Bank's lowered gold price of 935.4 yuan, which, based on the closing price, was approximately 26 yuan lower, 15 yuan less than the previous close. The registered amount for March was 896 yuan, and for April, 907 yuan. The morning swap rate was 888 yuan, and the afternoon swap rate was 890 yuan. The price of pure gold was approximately 1 yuan less than the forward price, at 901.8 yuan. The spot market remained quiet. Tianjin goods were priced at 1 yuan extra, but there was a lack of supply, so there were no transactions. The swap market continued to be weak. Hengxing posted 14 bars, Jiayu posted 28 bars, Tongfenghang bought 10 yuan, Futaiheng posted 49 bars to Huixiang, at 9.8 yuan, Yuanmaoyong posted 70 bars to Tongfenghang, at the same price, Dingtai posted 28 bars to Tongfenghang, Dafengheng 105 bars at 9.6 yuan. In the after-market, Changda posted 28 bars to Tongfenghang at 9.5 yuan, Fuxingyong posted 105 bars to Huixiang at 9.8 yuan.

There were 6,454 March bars left, with a total of 30 long positions and 17 short positions.</p>
<p>In on-floor trading, buying interest remained strong, but arbitrageurs had a strong appetite to sell. In summary, Dadecheng Wanxing Fuxingyong Dafayong Fuchang Hengyu Hongxing Yongfeng Dadashen Taiyuanyi and others were on the selling side. Dadecheng cut more than 3,000 bars. Huixiang Tongtaichang Yuanchangyong Fuyu Yifengyong Changda Wuchangxiang Yongli Futaiheng Yuqingyong Yongde Qianchangxiang Fushengyong Yuanmaoyong and others were on the buying side. Futaiheng advanced approximately 1,000 bars. Yicheng Yongli first sold and then bought. Yuanyi Yifengyong Yuanmaoyong Qingfayong Yuanchangyong first advanced and then sold.

The Guangdong Gang Shengyi advanced more than 100 bars and sold more than 200 bars. Hengxing's advances and sales were not significant.

The number of April contracts was 18,242, with a total of 57 long positions and 50 short positions.</p>
<p>The Gold Market Improved, and Chinese Merchants Bought Back American Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Sassoon and Qiao Zhifu Both Sold</p>
<p>The Day's Market Had Many Struggles</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London large bars both near and far rose by 1.25. New York silver prices remained unchanged. Montevideo forward silver prices remained unchanged and rose by 0.014, respectively. London spot gold shrank by half a penny. British pounds against US dollars did not change. British pounds against French francs shrank by 9 points. US dollars against British pounds did not change. US dollars against French francs grew by 25. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with a recent selling price of British pounds at 1 shilling 6 pence 0.375 and US dollars at 37.4375, compared to the previous close, with British pounds flat and US dollars slightly tight. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with British pounds rising by 0.0125 and US dollars rising by 0.025. The Customs Gold Unit fell by 0.013, without much impact. After the opening, banks lacked the appetite to sell, and Chinese merchants' psychology turned bullish, rushing to close positions, and the market immediately tightened, changing very quickly. It was known in advance that HSBC's posted rates for British pounds and US dollars were both flat, without much impact. After entering the market, banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the market gradually loosened. Sassoon leaned on merchants to sell, immediately turning hard. After this, Sassoon and Banque Franco-Chinoise sold shillings, and Chinese merchants' appetites suddenly waned, and the process was loose and indiscriminate. However, because banks took advantage of low prices to maintain positions, the market was still stable at noon, mainly due to the erratic psychology of Chinese merchants. The after-market opened flat, and then the market turned hard due to some supply from banks. However, the gold market was still stable, and buyers did not stop. The initial report of Indian silver fell by 4 annas, but because the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu sold US dollars, there was still fluctuation. After entering the market, the Central Bank had news of opening spot positions, and although Indian silver slightly rebounded, the market sentiment was upward, and Shanghai and other places vigorously bought. The process gradually tightened. Finally, the Guangdong gang came to sell, and the market turned stable again. The closing price for recent sales was British pounds at 1 shilling 6 pence 0.375 and US dollars at 37.375, compared to the previous close, with British pounds flat and US dollars tighter by 0.0125. Chinese merchants, with the gold market improving, and their purchasing appetite strengthened, bought back more than 500,000 yuan of US dollars. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu sold US dollars, and the Western merchant Sassoon sold British pounds. Below is a record of the day's transactions:</p>
<p>British Pound Morning Opening Recent Selling Price: 1 Shilling, 6 Pence 0.375, with Youtai selling to Huabi March 0.1875. McCallum selling to East Asia spot 0.3125.

<p>Foreign Call Loans Continued at 9 Percent</p>
<p>Collections and Deliveries Were Infrequent Due to Poor Turnover</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign call loan situation remained largely unchanged. Both the morning and afternoon markets opened at 9 percent, with surface markings and water added. Because surface transactions were idle, all were marked in white with no price. The underlying issue was poor turnover, making it impossible to raise funds, leading to a quiet market atmosphere. Call loan transactions were based on mutual relationships among industry peers, so advances and sales were infrequent, but yesterday was slightly more active than usual, with approximately 3.0 million in turnovers, over 500,000 in new transactions, over 300,000 in afternoon transactions, over 600,000 in small trade association transactions. Foreign pawnshop transactions redeemed over 600,000, with no new transactions. Banknote recalls were over 500,000, and over 400,000 in circulating notes were issued, over 500,000 in coded notes were issued, customer route sources were 200,000, and sales were 100,000. It was heard that a shipment from Hong Kong would arrive in Shanghai soon, but the number of the first batch was unknown. Bank collections and deliveries: foreign banks collected and delivered over 1.89 million in bills, over 3.45 million in various goods and foreign exchange pawnshop miscellaneous payments, over 700,000 in special exchange payments, over 500,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, 500,000 in warehousing. Chinese banks collected and delivered over 2.0 million in bills, over 4.1 million in various goods and foreign exchange tax miscellaneous payments, over 700,000 in special exchange payments, over 500,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, 300,000 in warehousing. Japanese banks collected and delivered over 1.7 million in bills, over 3.0 million in various goods and foreign exchange miscellaneous payments, over 500,000 in special exchange payments, over 300,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, 200,000 in warehousing. Money shops collected and delivered over 21.0 million in foreign public invoices, over 400,000 in foreign surface marking payments, over 500,000 in various route remittance payments, and 100,000 in cash deliveries.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Fell, Copper Coins Shrank</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver dollars were 830 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, down 6 yuan from the previous day. Transactions made were 120,000 yuan in the morning market and 45,000 yuan in the afternoon market. Copper coins shrank by 500 cash, to 329,500 cash. Transactions made were 46,130 strings, worth 14,000 yuan in silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Arbitrage Trading Persists, Bond Market Experiences Local Short Squeeze</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the February futures, except for the 1st and 2nd, gradually trended upwards from a firm base. Although money was tight in the environment, the money houses, due to tightening loans, had surplus funds, so there was quite a bit of arbitrage trading. The atmosphere of Sino-Japanese cooperation gradually intensified, and the association has also promulgated measures to encourage cash imports, which caused a short squeeze on the market. In reality, this phenomenon occurred because most people were bearish, short positions were crowded, and the settlement date was approaching. However, a meteoric rise is unlikely. Today is the last day for this month's futures, and there will still be some infighting. The turmoil of the "23 Customs" is gradually subsiding, and although there are still ups and downs, the volatility seems to have lessened, because most people have made preparations for the February futures. Yesterday's trading saw a flat start in the first two sessions in the morning, followed by a slight firming trend. Number 43 saw quite a bit of arbitrage. "23 Customs" initially rose by 7 or 8 jiao, but this month has seen calm. Subsequently, it continued to rise by about half a yuan. These fluctuations are still inevitably due to the actions of market makers and cannot yet be considered a genuine squeeze. The afternoon opening saw quite a bit of sporadic arbitrage, and the market gradually trended upwards, mostly by 2 or 3 jiao. "23 Customs" was also flat. At the close, arbitrage trading was still very active, causing a partial short squeeze, and all items saw an upward trend, mostly rising by 3 to 5 jiao. Number 48 saw a surge in selling of "23 Customs," and this month fell back by a small 4 jiao, while the forward month plummeted by 1 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. In terms of market results, except for the omitted series which was still down by a small 1 jiao or so, all other varieties rose by anywhere from 1 or 2 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao. "23 Customs" only rose by 1 jiao to 3 jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 20 million yuan. The results of the rises and falls are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Hit by Recovery Act</p>
<p>According to a report from New Feng Foreign Firm, yesterday (the 20th), the New York stock market trended weak. After President Roosevelt submitted the Recovery Act's message, railway and public utility stocks softened first, and the market then fell by 1 to 3 yuan. The income of public utility companies is generally regulated, so they suffered the most from the Recovery Act. Although the income of railways is also regulated, fortunately, industry regulations have not yet been formulated, but increased costs, such as increased wages for workers and rising material prices, will also cause considerable harm. When the selling spread to industrial stocks, steel, automobile, and entertainment stocks were the first to suffer. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company announced that it would continue to pay a dividend of 2 yuan and 2 jiao and a half per share, which had a considerable stabilizing effect on the market. The bond market followed the downstream trend of U.S. government bonds, the latter's softening was largely a reaction after the rise. The small exchange's stock market fell due to the selling of public utility stocks. Chicago wheat fell sharply due to speculation by speculators. The total daily trading volume was 970,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Decline in Standard Yarn Leads to Rebound</p>
<p>After a sharp decline in the yarn market the previous day, there was a rebound, leading to short covering for profit-taking. At the same time, the gold market stabilized, boosting confidence. In the morning, Tongcheng Company made large-scale purchases under another name, and the extremely weak yarn market showed a glimmer of activity. However, the environment is still unfavorable, and most people are bearish, so selling pressure is still heavy. However, the stock of yarn is more than half less than at the same time last year, it is said.</p>
<p>Forward Yarn is Relatively Firm</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, the current month only had one day of business left, but recipients were still wavering, causing anxiety. Therefore, the opening situation was quite chaotic. However, as the auction reached the forward months, the market situation improved, because Tongcheng Company made large-scale purchases under another name, and especially the second and third sessions rose. As a result, all months rose by 4, 5, or 8 jiao, except for the current month which did not move. In the afternoon, the market situation was stable, with no unexpected changes. However, it was said that Tongcheng Company's short positions were also fully covered directly. The current month may be bought at a discount by a certain party, and the market trend may be fixed, which is also not known. Near months were flat, and forward months rose by 3 or 5 jiao. Sales were: He Xing 950 bales, Yuan Da 900 bales, Tai Chang 650 bales, Heng Chang 1,150 bales, Xin Cheng 1,100 bales, Yuan Da 650 bales. Purchases were: Ji Feng 750 bales, Geng Feng 500 bales, Tong Hua 500 bales, Chang Ji 700 bales, Yi Kang 2,800 bales, Sen Kang 450 bales, Yong Da 450 bales, Run Kang 400 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Sales Become Scarce</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were slightly clearer, but less than before. It is estimated that all gangs bought a total of 505 bales for the whole day. The market was calm. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Shows Signs of Recovery</p>
<p>After consecutive days of sharp declines, the cotton market showed signs of recovery and rebound. At the same time, the gold market turned higher. Some people receiving cotton in the current month turned to non-delivery, which stabilized the bulls' minds. Tongcheng Company made large-scale purchases, and the market slightly rose. However, most people are still bearish.</p>
<p>Yuan Da Covers Short Positions</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market, the current month's situation was extremely weak. Most people expected it to break through the 5-yuan mark, so selling pressure was intense. Unexpectedly, Yuan Da covered its short positions and did not deliver, covering position by position. The previous market maintained the 5-yuan line and did not break through. The forward month's Tongcheng Company entrusted another name to purchase and cover positions, turning firm. As a result, all months rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half, except for the current month which fell by 5 fen. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price rose by 5 yuan compared to the previous day. A major player in the previous market covered short positions, and a certain company's bulls had already been cut clean. The market situation became more stable. The current month rose by 2 jiao, and the forward months rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao. Sales were: Yuan Da 1,900 dan, Da Feng 5,500 dan, Rui Da 1,400 dan, Yuan Da 1,100 dan, Yuan Yi 1,300 dan, Chang Feng 4,000 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 1,100 dan, Jun Chang 2,700 dan, Yi Cheng 1,200 dan. Purchases were: Da Fu 1,600 dan, Ji Feng 2,100 dan, Yi Kang 6,000 dan, Run Kang 6,700 dan, Xie Cheng 1,900 dan, Chang Yu 1,700 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 1,600 dan, Xin Cheng 1,100 dan, Da Chang 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Mills Need to Halt Production</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton is increasingly sluggish, and the mills' demand is not smooth. The source is estimated to be 110 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Overseas Cotton Market Shows Mixed Trends</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with a firm trend and active trading. However, most of the activity was due to the liquidation of March positions and transfers to forward months. Subsequently, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and liquidation by brokerage firms, all months fell by 1 to 3 points. In the middle of the day, prices rose due to purchases of March contracts by peers and Liverpool buyers. There were not many sellers, and the market rose with small-scale purchases. Near the close, wheat and the stock market weakened, and the cotton market followed suit. However, there was some short covering at the close, and the market remained firm. Spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices rose by 1 to 5 points. The English cotton market was weak, spot prices fell by 8 points, and futures prices fell by 12 points. Indian cotton was weak due to bull liquidation and lack of buying. Pingguoer fell by half a rupee, Aomula fell by 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 3.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 20th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bairoxi cotton on the 21st was 247 rupees, up half a rupee from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>Manchester Yarn Prices Slightly Firm</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Manchester on the 20th, the yarn market demand is still weak, and prices are slightly firm. 20-count yarn sells for 10 to 11 pence, 30-count yarn sells for 11 to 12 pence, and 40-count yarn sells for 12 and 1/8 to 13 and 3/8 pence, all up by 1/8 of a penny. 60-count Egyptian cotton yarn sells for 16 to 17 pence, unchanged.</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese and Japanese Yarn Export Volume in Early February</p>
<p>Shanghai's cotton yarn export volume in early February decreased compared to late January. Chinese mills' yarn exports totaled 5,138 bales, compared to 15,045 bales in late January. Japanese mills' yarn exports were 1,585 bales, compared to 5,770 bales in late January. The export quantities to various regions are as follows (unit: bales):</p>
<p>Shanghai Japanese Yarn Sales in January</p>
<p>In January, Japanese mills in Shanghai sold a total of 30,185 bales, an increase of 819 bales compared to December. Shanghai sales were the most active, reaching 10,322 bales, followed by Korea and India. The sales quantities to various regions are listed below (unit: bales):</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Future Flour is Close to Flat, Forward Months Slightly Lower</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the morning opening, each month showed a steady and fluctuating trend. In terms of imported wheat quotations, Chicago fell by about 3, 4, or 5 jiao, and Canada fell by about 1 jiao and 6 fen. At the time of opening, the current month was mostly sold off due to floating orders. Although spot sales still felt active, the trend did not turn flat. For the forward months, although imported wheat quotations fell, aside from factory hedging sales, there were only more long positions than short positions in the industry. Therefore, amidst the fluctuations, there was a slight firming trend. Until the afternoon opening, the current month turned stable due to the continued purchases by customer gangs. The forward months saw very clear trading, and buyers were slightly quiet, so the market atmosphere slightly softened. The subsequent situation, if there are no special changes in imported wheat, should be seen as a stable situation. As a result, February and March were unchanged, April was down by a small 2.5 li, May was down by a small 7.5 li, and June and July were down by a small 2.5 li.</p>
<p>Future Wheat Shows a Softening Trend Amidst Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the future wheat market, after the morning and afternoon openings, each month generally showed a stagnant and weak trend. In terms of imported wheat quotations, Chicago fell by about 3, 4, or 5 jiao, and Canada fell by 1 jiao and 6 fen. At the time of opening, trading in each month was light and dull. Because the market situation was very complex, given the trend of spot imported wheat, the market atmosphere could not turn bullish. However, after being too low, factories naturally had a purchasing trend, so it could not be suppressed too much. Therefore, amidst the fluctuations, only a slight decline was seen. As a result, the current month was down by 1 fen, March was down by 3 fen, and April was down by 2 fen. In the spot wheat market, due to the mills' good appetite, high-quality goods remained stable, while medium and lower-quality goods loosened slightly. Kaiyingzhou wheat was priced at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 3 or 4 fen, Bengbu wheat was priced at 3 yuan and 9 jiao, and Gaoyou wheat was priced at 3 yuan and 8 jiao and 7 or 8 fen, totaling 3,800 bales, which were purchased by Shen Da, it is said.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat, the export situation in Canada shows no signs of improvement. Some Winnipeg locals are selling off, and there is hope only if there is progress in commercial needs.</p>
<p>River Rice Arrivals and Sales are Both Weak</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources for each gang were even less, totaling only a little over ten houses. Arrivals and sales were both sparse, and the market situation was stable. The prices of each thick japonica rice showed no ups or downs. Late rice was also similar. Only those from Zhongguan were relatively lacking in arrivals, and there was some movement in bag orders, seemingly slightly brightening. Shade-dried Yuan rice continued to be unchanged, and Duyang pointed rice had no market. It is estimated that bag orders included 400-500 bales from the Beijing and Yantai gangs, and 300-400 bales of stacked goods.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were a little over ten sources from the river. Light rain fell continuously. The transactions of various goods on the market were minimal. The price of medium-quality shade-dried Yuan rice was close to a chi. Thin rice was continuously consumed and converted. The debt conversely fell by a small 1 jiao. Yangjian rice sales were stagnant for days. The price had a small fall. Otherwise, prices were generally stable. Only small-price white japonica rice was not abundant in the market, and the appetite was still movable. The price was 5 or 6 fen higher.</p>
<p>Customer Indica Rice Prices are High and Sales are Sluggish</p>
<p>Selling Prices Fluctuate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the foreign customer indica rice market was mixed. After consecutive days of price increases in customer indica rice, importers became hesitant and were constrained by lower-quality foreign rice and broken foreign rice, so customer indica rice could not rise any further. However, the production price was high, and subsequent batches were difficult to transport. Yesterday morning, only bag orders were unopened. In the afternoon, the interior purchased 2,148 bags of brown rice and 100 bags of machine oil. The price was similar to the previous market. The consumption of foreign rice in the interior was still active. Yesterday, 30 bags of Sai Gon No. 3 and 5,600 bags of broken rice were purchased from the interior. This street also purchased 3,300 bags of high-quality Sai Gon and Siamese machine rice. The price of No. 3 and broken rice continued to rise by 5 or 6 fen. Round-grain high-quality Sai Gon rice had few arrivals, and the price rose by nearly 1 jiao. Long-grain Sai Gon rice had sufficient inventory and arrivals, and conversely fell by a small 5 fen, it is said.</p>
<p>Soybeans Turn Up 5 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market situation, with a lively factory appetite and optimistic sentiment, turned up by 5 fen. Hankou beans also had a tight trend of 2 or 3 fen. Yesterday, it was estimated that factories purchased a total of three truckloads of whole river beans, priced at 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 2 fen and 9 jiao. Two truckloads of Yingzhou beans, priced at 3 yuan and 8 jiao and 6 fen. One truckload of Guide beans, priced at 3 yuan and 9 jiao. Additionally, Jiangbei gangs purchased one truckload of Bengbu beans, priced at 3 yuan and 8 jiao and 3 fen. In this street, the interior purchased over 350 bags of Shashi beans, priced at 3 yuan and 4 jiao and 7 fen. Over 1,500 bags of Hankou Zha beans, priced from 3 yuan and 5 jiao and 8 fen to 5 jiao.</p>

<h3>Various Aspects of Humanity</h3>
<p>— Bai Zhu</p>
<p>Masks, broadly speaking, can be divided into two types.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw, in one of his plays, used the words of a stone man to satirize the world: "In every concert in England, you can see countless rows of bored people who are there not because they really like classical music, but because they think they should like it. The same thing happens in the Kingdom of Heaven. Many people are sitting there gloriously not because they are happy, but because they feel that for the sake of decency, they have to sit there. Almost all of them are British." These witty words are truly a wake-up call to the hypocritical and reserved people of the world. In our lives, we don't know how many such people we can encounter. They wear masks and build their own fortresses with lies and evasions. They have never not known that they are fake, but in order to maintain their own identity and interests, they have to succumb to these masks and walk into the tomb. Courteous dealings, dignified and serene demeanor, inside these may be lurking the most despicable fraud in the world. "When the host says 'advance,' then they bow twice and deliberately delay getting up. When they get up, they present longevity money to the host. If the host deliberately refuses to accept it, then they insist. If the host deliberately refuses to accept it firmly, then they insist again. Only then does he order the official to accept it. Then they bow twice again, and again deliberately delay getting up. When they get up, they perform five or six bows before leaving." These actions of hosts and guests yielding and retreating simply constitute a wonderful "human comedy." In addition, when lovers meet, whispering sweet nothings, they say something like: "How can I leave you!" This is all too much like acting. If we sit down and think about it carefully, we can't help but laugh silently.</p>
<p>However, besides these, masks also appear in human life in another form. This is not the pillar of a gentleman's demeanor, but a forced affectation under the whip of a ruthless life. The waitresses in hotels, the dancers in dance halls, the prostitutes in the red light district, the low-level employees who watch the faces of their superiors, the impoverished households who try to keep up appearances, and the merchants who force themselves to smile. Although their lives are filled with countless festering sores, they still have to wear their masks in order to live. They have to smile when they meet people, have to have charming eyes, and have to have respectful manners. These are just superficial phenomena on the surface of their lives. Only when we dig deep into the roots can we know that all of this is fake, just like a few bright flowers and plants on a ruin, or a few pleasant musical sounds beside a dead person's coffin. In this art of dealing with the world, where people's joys and sorrows are different and where people's feelings are controlled by others, there is truly buried a deep and incomparable human flavor. If you are not a superficial observer, you will read from the ingratiating smiles that fear not being favored by others, from the fawning smiles that fear not grasping the other party, and from the forced smiles that fear being seen as weak, the tearful and blurred pleas of a heart squeezed under the heavy grinding of life. This state of mind of seeking joy in poverty and seeking laughter in tears soon turns into a complete paralysis, and even wearing a mask without realizing it, moving vaguely like a ghost. Such characters can often be seen in Russian novels. In a short story by Andreyev entitled "Laughter," he writes about a person who wears a funny mask to a dance party to meet the lover who abandoned him. He says: "Wherever I go, a burst of laughter surrounds me. It is with me, and I cannot escape this circle of revelry... But how lonely I am under this mask!" Later, when he left the venue and walked onto the street, his friend, while praising him for being interesting, saw that he had scratched his mask and suddenly realized: "By God, he was actually crying!" That's right, he had been crying all along.</p>
<p>Although these two types of masks are different, they are both deformed characters created by this deformed society. When will people throw their masks into the trash heap? When will people be able to live a better life?</p>
<h3>The Content and Form of Scientific Essays</h3>
<p>— Ren Baige</p>
<p>Literature and science have always had a strict boundary. According to the classification of scholars in the past, it was generally believed that literature is figurative description, focusing on sensibility, and science is abstract explanation, focusing on reason. Thus, they were clearly separated both in form and content. Now, once we want to unite them well, there will naturally be many difficulties. However, judging from the existing attempts, it is not entirely without merit. As long as our writers are willing to work hard, they will of course get satisfactory results. Here, I will briefly talk about the cultivation of our writers.</p>
<p>In the past, because literature and science had a strict boundary, writers mostly could only be writers or scholars in one field. Writers often lacked a scientific mind, and scientists often lacked literary skill. It is rare to find a writer like G.H. Wells who wrote many historical and scientific stories in a literary style and tone. Therefore, it is really very difficult to find a writer who truly possesses both a scientific mind and literary skill. Naturally, so-called scientific essays are not easy to produce. Recently, on the one hand, due to the growth of new literary theories, a literary artist must have a scientific perspective whether in criticism or creation. On the other hand, because literary works are relatively easy to access by the public, scientists who generally approach the public have had to apply literary forms to introduce science to the public. Thus, literature and science have had a possible unity. It is not accidental that scientific essays are produced at this time. To write good scientific essays, needless to say, the prerequisite is that it must be a person who truly possesses both a scientific mind and literary skill. Shouldn't our writers who often write scientific essays pay special attention to such cultivation?</p>
<p>How should one cultivate oneself? Objectively speaking, since so-called scientific essays are the unity of science and literature, subjectively speaking, it should be a kind of comprehensive research and learning. Science cannot be separated from the explanation of laws, and literature cannot be separated from the description of typical examples. Moreover, this is very important. The so-called comprehensive research and learning lies in enabling writers to cultivate the ability to use scientific knowledge and literary skills to depict and explain every thing and law in a typical way. As long as one has this kind of ability, I believe that the scientific essays produced will certainly be more impressive. Directly speaking, this is to require our writers to simultaneously possess scientific and literary cultivation in a unity, and to unite these two kinds of cultivation. As for what scientific and literary cultivation is, it is unnecessary to say more.</p>
<p>Saying this, it is probably not very clear. Here, it is better to cite another example. For example, how should a scientific essay with the theme of "firefly" be written correctly? In a person who has both scientific and literary cultivation, he first extracts the points that need to be explained scientifically, and then describes them according to literary methods. The main thing about the depiction of characters in literature is the typical among the general. Except for being used as a symbol of identity and an explanation of personality and state of mind, all static external descriptions are dispensable. Describing the ears and mouth of a certain person and the clothes that a certain person is wearing in every detail is ultimately the method of old novels, and that era has long passed. Applying this concretely to scientific essays means that when writing about "fireflies," there is no need to spend a lot of ink describing how beautiful its firefly is. Instead, one should mainly describe the story of a firefly from its occurrence and development, form and characteristics, and its relationship to human society. Other things can be inferred by analogy. I wonder if the writers who currently write scientific essays generally agree with this opinion?</p>
<p>Speaking only of the scientific essays currently written by general writers, it is true that, as some people have said, many are either like a lesson in a textbook or put too much emphasis on the formal aspects, and they only pay attention to natural science but not social science. To remedy this shortcoming, I do not object to some of the things that people have proposed to write. However, I think that it is not very appropriate to belittle the "literary art" of scientific essays and their role in breaking superstitions. We are still in a period of experimentation, and we should have considerable tolerance and generosity towards the scientific essays published in magazines. Because at least it is a progress to turn something useless in essays into something useful.</p>
<h3>Casual Talks on Historical Essays (2)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The first one I wrote was about Fan Zeng. It took the story of Fan Zeng being alienated by Xiang Yu and dying of an ulcer on his back on the way back to Pengcheng as its theme. The center was the shadow of an intellectual being abandoned by a sword hilt. It was entitled "Ya Wen" and published in "Literary Monthly." Looking back now, I loved to lengthen the article too much, and it was no longer a historical essay. Later, I changed my own method, focusing on injecting new feelings, and using historical events as examples to explain a certain consciousness. Then I began to write the two short stories "Jesus and Christ" and "Su Xiaoxiao and the White Snake." At that time, I first wanted to criticize a certain event in reality, and use historical events to elaborate. Occasionally, I could express the sadness in my heart, but I inevitably distorted the original appearance of the historical events, so it could not be regarded as a standard historical essay. Sometimes I had deep feelings, but in the eyes of the readers, they were treated as lighthearted old stories. Therefore, I didn't want to write this kind of trivial play about entrusting ancient times with my feelings anymore, and I made up my mind to try to write standard historical essays. The death of Mi Heng was my attempt. Other short stories written before and after include Ye Mingchen, Liu Zhen Ping Zhu (see "New Novel"), and the Burning Grass Incident (semi-monthly "Mangzhong").</p>
<p>When I first started writing, I often had the illusion that I couldn't write without a complete story. Later, I gradually realized that whether the story was complete or not was secondary. How to organize the story was the most important thing. Mi Heng has a biography in the "Book of the Later Han." He relied on his talent and was arrogant, and could not be tolerated by Cao Cao, Liu Biao, or Huang Zu. In the poems praising Parrot Island throughout history, many blamed Cao Cao and Huang Zu, saying that they could not tolerate genius. I looked at the entire biography carefully and felt that Mi Heng's death was not due to Cao Cao and Huang Zu being jealous of his talent, but due to Cao Cao. The left and right people of Huang Zu should be able to depict this point of view as the center. At the end of the biography, the two sentences "Zu usually hated Heng, and immediately killed him" clearly broke this cause, while the previous text "Cao was angry, ... sent him to Liu Biao, ... before leaving, everyone sent him off, ... all used insults that he did not get up ...", "Biao once drafted a memorial with the literary men, and used his talents, but when Heng came back and saw it, he destroyed it by throwing it on the ground before he even finished reading it, and Biao was stunned. Heng then asked for pen and paper, and composed it in a moment. The wording was admirable, and Biao was very happy and respected him even more." In the lines, there was vaguely a situation where the left and right people harbored resentment and jealousy and helped the master to drive away guests. I reversed the order and reorganized the story. Huang She (Huang Zu's son) was used to set off Mi Heng, the Parrot Island Ode was used as Mi Heng's spiritual confession, and Huang Zu's impatience and the legal clerk's use of the opportunity to avenge personal grudges were used as the connecting thread of the event. The historical events were the main focus, and no distortion or explanation was added. Surprisingly, the new meaning could be clearly conveyed, and I believed that it conformed to the basic principles of historical essays.</p>
<h3>Class Suspension</h3>
<p>— Ren Daquan</p>
<p>Dragging his melancholy steps, Mr. Wang walked out of the principal's office, hands clasped behind his back, heading towards the school.</p>
<p>His heart felt strangely stifled, and his thick, dark eyebrows were tightly furrowed on his pale, thin face. His mind was empty, filled only with the smiling face of the principal, with his flat mouth opened wide, toothless. The words that came out of that flat mouth were still echoing in Mr. Wang's ears—</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, alas! I'm really very sorry… Truly, brother, I'm very apologetic! Alas! … But, Mr. Wang, there's really no way! You think, the harvest is so bad, who in the village can afford to study? Alas! … If the harvest were good, it wouldn't be like this, alas! … Then we'll have to suspend classes temporarily, there's really nothing to be done without money, Mr. Wang, right? I personally certainly hope to maintain it, but the reality is this, there's no way! Alas! … No way! …"</p>
<p>Stepping over the school threshold, Mr. Wang released his hands from behind his back and sighed deeply.</p>
<p>As soon as they heard the teacher's voice, a large group of children playing together scattered with a "Ya!" and returned to their seats, eyes fixed on their books, pretending to be very attentive, mumbling sentences that they themselves couldn't hear clearly.</p>
<p>Normally, Mr. Wang would have frowned and scolded sternly: "Playing again, not studying hard, you won't be dismissed until you can recite your lessons!" Or he would stand in front of any child and point to the book, saying: "Read it clearly to me, read it word by word, what are you mumbling about?"</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Wang only glanced at each child's face and silently returned out of the school gate.</p>
<p>In front of the school gate was a large mulberry field with dense leaves, a sea of green as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>Looking at the clusters of deep green mulberry leaves, Mr. Wang remembered when he first came to teach at this rural elementary school, the mulberry trees were just bare branches. It was truly unexpected! The school would close after only one semester. Although the life of a teacher was quite poor, guiding thirty or forty naughty children all day long, the souls of these barefoot, ragged children were pure and innocent. Their faces often had innocent and lovely smiles without a trace of pretense…</p>
<p>But it's over! Besides the sorrow of being unemployed, Mr. Wang's heart was also filled with a deep sense of loss.</p>
<p>A burst of sharp and energetic shouts from the children called Mr. Wang back into the room.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>The next morning, the school was strangely lively: children who were usually lazy and late all came early, their little faces covered with a melancholic expression. Pairs of lively eyes stared blankly at the teacher, who was busy packing his luggage, and the teacher also stole glances at them from time to time.</p>
<p>"Will the teacher come back after leaving?"</p>
<p>"We haven't even read half a textbook in Chinese!"</p>
<p>"Why doesn't the teacher teach us anymore and want to go back? It's so good here."</p>
<p>"We don't want the teacher to leave, teacher, don't go!"</p>
<p>Listening to the soft and quiet questions, Mr. Wang smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>The principal and a porter carrying the luggage arrived. The porter picked up the luggage, and Mr. Wang followed closely behind, leaving the school gate. The principal and a large group of children followed, seeing him off to the road outside the village that led to the city.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, goodbye! Goodbye!" the principal said, opening his flat mouth.</p>
<p>"Ah! Principal, goodbye!"</p>
<p>"Teacher! Teacher!"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang turned his head and saw that the children's eyes were mostly wet and glistening.</p>
<p>The road was long, and Mr. Wang seemed to still hear a burst of strangely affectionate cries in his ears:</p>
<p>"Teacher! Teacher!"</p>
<h3>Sound of Clothes Beating</h3>
<h3>Towards Evening (4)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>"Chunyang Inn—Chunyang Inn, is it not?" The shorter one raised his head and smiled. At the same time, he also stopped. A girl and an old woman then passed through the pair standing there. The taller and shorter ones both turned their heads to look at the girl. A pale white face, two fiery red cheeks. The eyes were swollen and tired. Her entire figure revealed an immature injury.</p>
<p>Both forgot what they should say.</p>
<p>"A yes—going, ah!" Immediately a contrived voice floated up from the side. The old woman's face, like a pomelo rind, appeared before them.</p>
<p>"Hmph!" Each spat out a frivolous sound from his nose. Each felt that his eyes should take a bath to be clean. And so they immediately floated their eyes towards Zhongshan Road, wanting to find an ocean for eyes with smoke-like light!</p>
<p>"Is it not?" The shorter one then waved his short legs and walked off. At the same time, he took out a piece of paper from his pants pocket. "Opposite Dahan Company, Chunyang Inn, Room 13! Please come for a chat. Sincerely, Guo Ren, Brothers Li An, from your brother Hu Yiyuan." Looking at it, he read it out loud.</p>
<p>This time, the taller one followed the shorter one. But the taller one always felt as if a single step would kick through the shorter one's butt, and so he dared not take large strides.</p>
<p>Chunyang Inn was opposite Dahan Company. But Dahan Company's rooftop was higher than Chunyang Inn. Dahan Company's facade was also wider than Chunyang Inn. This naturally matched pair walked in front of Dahan Company, but still could not find Chunyang Inn. And so they stopped again on the sidewalk, stretching their heads to look at Dahan Company.</p>

<h3>Remarriage and Widow Marriage</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The principle is very simple. Before national laws explicitly state otherwise, men who lose their wives can remarry, and women who lose their husbands can of course remarry as well. However, the situation in China is different. Chinese society only allows men who have lost their wives to remarry, but does not allow women who have lost their husbands to remarry. This is not a strange thing, because China is a land that values ​​ethics and morality the most! Of the three unfilial acts, having no descendants is the greatest. A man who has the responsibility of carrying on the family line, if his wife dies, and he does not remarry to have someone take her place, I ask, who will inherit the ancestral incense? It is best if he is willing to remarry. If there is a man who does not want to remarry after his wife dies, I am afraid that his relatives and clansmen will find a woman for him and force him to have children with her! As for women, starving to death is a small matter, losing chastity is a great matter. If a woman who loses her husband does not think of hanging herself to die in honor, she is already not considered a perfect heroine. Would she be allowed to remarry? Remarriage would not only disgrace the family, but would also shatter the existing morality! If someone asks me, why does Chinese society treat men and women so differently? I can only answer that this is how etiquette has always been. Is this answer not enough for you?</p>
<p>People like to take two recent events that happened in Chinese society and compare them, criticize them, and use them to attack the unreasonableness of the old etiquette. One is the wedding of Xiong and Mao, which shook Shanghai society and was praised as a good story. The other is the wedding of Wang and Wei, which shocked Tianjin society and became a joke. The reason why these two marriages were praised as a good story and became a joke is because the former was the remarriage of a man who had lost his wife, and the latter was the remarriage of a woman who had lost her husband. Otherwise, if they were just two ordinary marriages, they would not have attracted so much attention.</p>
<p>In fact, those who take these two marriages to compare and criticize are a bit far-fetched. Because the wedding of Xiong and Mao is one thing, and the wedding of Wang and Wei is another thing. These two things, from the point of view of men remarrying and women remarrying, the former is encouraged by the old morality, and the latter is prohibited by the old etiquette, so they cannot be compared. Moreover, the protagonist of the remarriage is a man with a special status in society, and the protagonist of the remarriage is a concubine of a man with a high status in society. Can you blame the social figures for praising the wedding of Xiong and Mao and ridiculing the wedding of Wang and Wei? Wei Wenxiu's denunciation and expulsion is exactly the guilt that a shameless and unchaste widow deserves! Now that she has fled to West Lake to knock on wooden fish amidst the siege of all sides, is it not too late to regret it? Gentlemen and guardians of morality cannot but be deeply saddened!</p>
<p>However, those who are fighting for injustice against the remarriage of Wei Wenxiu can at most bring out Chinese law as a talisman, saying that the law of the Republic of China does not have an explicit provision prohibiting widows from remarrying, so Wei's remarriage is actually allowed by national law. Moreover, Wei's combination with Li is only as a concubine, and remarriage is her own right and freedom, and is not bound by law. And marriage is a private act, so how can others intervene? But ah, those who are calling for justice for Wei, you must not forget that in addition to the tangible laws, there are also intangible morals. Wei's remarriage, even if allowed by law, cannot escape the sanctions of the old social morality. If a woman can remarry after her husband dies, how can the two words "chastity" be preserved? Moreover, Li Gong was once the president of the country!</p>
<p>I dare to make an arbitrary statement: in China, a male-dominated society can be maintained for at least another five hundred years!</p>
<h3>Farewell</h3>
<p>— Zhou Han</p>
<p>The spring rain was blowing softly, and although it was already dawn, the clouds were densely interwoven, as if it were still early. Yu Yu looked out the window for a moment, not wanting to get up. His wife didn't believe it was still early, so she turned on the light on the bedside table, looked at her watch, and exclaimed, "Oh my, it's already half past six!" Half past six, if she didn't get up, how would she make it in time? The two quickly dressed, washed their faces, and prepared their luggage. The suitcase and miscellaneous items had been packed the night before, and now they only had to tie up the bedding. Two quilts were to be taken, and in addition, a blanket was needed. "Okay, take them all," Yu Yu said, starting to pack the bedding. Not having experience, the first time he packed it, it was loose and big. The second time he packed it tighter, but it was still very big. So-so, there was no way, any later and they would miss the train. It was naturally troublesome for women to go out. Just the work of putting on makeup would take half an hour. He was packing the bedding while urging her to hurry, but makeup was a woman's only job, and she couldn't be careless about it. The more you urged her to hurry, the slower she became. The first time the powder was too thick, ugly, so she washed it off; the second time she felt it was too thin, so she added a little. The time she spent looking in the mirror was also especially long. She looked in the front, looked in the back, admiring herself in the mirror as if feeling sorry for herself, and that took up most of the time. Yu Yu finished packing the bedding, broke out in a sweat, and was already unhappy. Seeing her wasting valuable time like that, his temper flared up. If it were an ordinary outing, he would have already started scolding, but now she was going far away, and it was right to endure a little and let her feel his tenderness. Moreover, they had already quarreled the night before, so why leave her with a bad impression when she left? Thinking of this, Yu Yu remained silent and simply lit a cigarette to wait for her. And in the midst of the smoke, he recalled the scene of the quarrel last night.</p>
<p>His wife still didn't want to go home last night. Life was so poor, what reason was there not to go home? She couldn't say the reason. But she didn't want to go. Yu Yu lost his temper and said, "Okay, you don't want to go, fine. From now on, I'll take care of myself, you take care of yourself." His wife was stubborn and said defiantly, "You won't take care of me? Hmph, that's easier said than done! See, if I starve to death in Shanghai, it's not like you'll be any more glorious!" "Then you won't leave, what do you want me to do?" Yu Yu shouted loudly, and finally scolded, "Damn it, I owed you in my past life, and I'm paying it back in this life!" The reason why his wife didn't want to leave was just because the separation would be three years, she had only recently come to Shanghai to find him, and now she had to go back, she couldn't bear to separate emotionally—it was all about the emotion, but Yu Yu didn't care about that. He was completely a materialist, and had forgotten about emotions after being whipped by life. His wife understood that he didn't care about emotions, and couldn't help but feel sad and burst into tears. "I don't want to leave, I just don't want to leave you, but you scold me as if I'm worthless, what kind of person have you become?" She cried loudly, which made Yu Yu even more uncomfortable, and a feeling of sadness and hatred arose from his annoyance. "Tsk tsk tsk, women,..." Saying that, he realized that he was really too ruthless, and with a change of heart, he felt a little regretful, and his voice became gentle and peaceful. "It's not that I want you to leave me, but, you have to know, I've been unemployed for a long time, and life is impossible. It's already difficult for me to support myself in Shanghai, if I add another person, what can I do?" He went up to comfort her, saying some heartfelt words, and only then did his wife agree to leave.</p>
<p>Now it was already late, and his wife was still deliberately wasting time putting on makeup, wanting to lose his temper but feeling that he shouldn't, and not losing his temper was really unbearable. He took a few puffs of his cigarette and shouted at her, "So-so, okay,... hurry, hurry;" His wife saw his anxiety and irritability in the mirror, and felt both sad and amused in her heart. A thought also arose in her mind, to spend a little more time putting on makeup, to miss the train schedule; if she couldn't leave today, she would change it to tomorrow, if she couldn't leave tomorrow, she would change it to the day after tomorrow; to stay a few more days. But because they had already quarreled last night, staying would lead to a decisive break, so she dismissed the idea.</p>
<p>The two took a car to the North Station, and it was already late. The people seeing them off on the platform were already waiting by the train carriages. After Yu Yu settled his wife down, he only said one sentence, "Don't worry, I'll write to you and call you to come as soon as I can." His wife's eyes were red and moist. "The train is about to leave, I'm leaving." Saying that, he got off the train, without even turning his head, and went straight out of the platform.</p>
<h3>A Helping Hand</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>Feelings of the Past and Present</h3>
<p>— Mao Hua</p>
<p>What I am about to say are things that happened six or seven years ago. During my trips back to my hometown during the winter and summer vacations, I always saw many beggars coming to the door to beg; asking for rice, asking for leftover rice, asking for copper coins, as long as you were willing to give, they wanted everything. Moreover, they had ways of contacting each other. As long as one beggar got something at your house, he would immediately notify the other beggars when he left, making your courtyard like a marketplace, and you would be too busy to attend to them all.—That situation was very annoying to me!</p>
<p>At that time, I had received a little education, and I was extremely opposed to giving alms to beggars. I thought that a person should work, should engage in productive work, and should use physical strength to exchange for food. Beggars, on the other hand, are clearly consumers, not producers. Although there may be a few people who are excluded from the circle of life, and begging out of shame is forced upon them, it is excusable. But based on the saying "Begging for three years, lazy to be emperor", there are indeed many people who are content with a free and leisurely begging life and do not think of extricating themselves! Therefore, giving alms to them is exactly harming them, exactly increasing their laziness, and exactly burying their future.—This is the simple reason why I oppose giving alms.</p>
<p>But my mother's opinion was exactly the opposite of mine. She thought that it was always good to give alms, and when there was nothing to give alms, the family would be unlucky. Obviously, she had a superstitious idea, and part of the supporters of that idea was the old saying "Large donations lead to great wealth". She sincerely hoped that the family fortune would improve year by year!</p>
<p>I couldn't bear to go against my mother's heart, and after arguing a few sentences, I let her have her way.</p>
<p>However, the places where my mother and I disagreed were not limited to dealing with beggars. Like burning "New Year's Eve dinner" on New Year's Eve was also a subject of controversy. According to tradition, my mother always liked to burn a lot of New Year's Eve dinner, until the fifth day of the new year, "Road God's birthday", to stop. I was extremely disgusted with eating leftover rice every day. When my mother was hiding in the rice bin scooping rice, I always made a fuss about scooping less, so as not to eat leftover rice every day. But she didn't say anything, just ignored it.</p>
<p>I listened impatiently: she called a name and scooped a liter of rice. There were seventeen or eighteen people in the family, so she scooped seventeen or eighteen liters of rice. Moreover, some of them were children under the age of three, and actually my grandmother and great-grandmother who did not eat at my house, she also counted their food, didn't she scoop a few more liters of rice out of thin air? However, I didn't say anything anymore, anyway, she would ignore it.</p>
<p>Later on, I heard her say that the cat also gets a liter, and the dog also gets a liter, which made me have to explode. But her answer was very simple: "Cats have cat food, dogs have dog food". I knew that arguing would not be effective, so I had to stretch my throat and eat leftover rice.</p>
<p>Obviously, my mother's idea was again built on the hope of a good omen. She hoped to have enough food and clothing, and the family would improve year by year!</p>
<p>The development of the facts is terrible. That was already six or seven years ago, but compared with the situation today, the rapid decline of the family is really making us feel extremely terrified! Now, the fields are gone, and we eat grain all year round, which is very miserable and tragic. When beggars come to the door, we are reluctant to give alms anymore. In fact, there is nothing to give alms, and we often end up driving them away with harsh words, and the atmosphere is very bad!</p>
<p>Now, whether there is rice for New Year's Eve dinner is still a question: even if there is rice for New Year's Eve dinner, whether the creditors will let us eat it is still a question.—Because of many questions, my mother is constantly thinking in depression, seeking a solution; undoubtedly, her previous dream has been shattered, and the generous methods of "cats have cat food, dogs have dog food" when scooping rice can no longer be used. Moreover, even if I'm afraid of eating leftover rice, there's no need for me to object!</p>
<h3>On the Way to Relief</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Also unable to care about the whistling cold wind outside, and the heavy sky covered with red clouds, was progressing towards severity. Although the partners all felt a bit timid, showing a spider-like expression, the responsibility we bear is really too great. In another place, there are countless starving refugees, male, female, old, young... groaning, weeping, holding their shrunken bellies, stretching their thin necks, hoping for our group. Countless lives about to die, waiting urgently for us to rescue them, we are the people who give relief.</p>
<p>After eating breakfast hastily, we took the Yongche bus at nine o'clock to District Seven. We got off at the crossroads at eleven o'clock. The cold wind mercilessly tried its best to blow on us. The cotton robes fluttered up like single garments. Everyone had to grit their teeth, hug their chests tightly with both hands. After walking a few steps, snowflakes began to sprinkle on the ground. Someone was the first to shout: "What to do, it's snowing!"</p>
<p>"It's better to snow, it won't be very cold on a snowy day." I said, this was just a word to comfort people's hearts. After all, we were not sitting in a room with doors and windows closed. This place was still sixty miles away from our destination on a rugged mountain road. We didn't bring anything to keep out the cold. Several partners who were used to sitting in the office naturally couldn't help but complain. The wind in the mountains was like sharp steel arrows stabbing everyone's face from the fluttering snowflakes. The snowflakes rested on the eyelashes and melted into water droplets. The hands hiding in the pockets did not dare to reach out to wipe them.</p>
<p>In the hearts of several weaker partners, they were preparing not to move forward. I had to advise them again: "Please endure some more hardship, countless dying lives are in our hands!"</p>
<p>Looking up at the sky, hot air flowed out of the mouth and disappeared into the wind and snow.</p>
<p>"The snow will probably stop, right? Look at the sky over there, it's very bright..." But the snowballs in front of us were getting bigger and bigger, and denser and denser. The front had become a blurred wilderness, and it was almost impossible to tell the way. There was no way to think. With great difficulty, we found a few sedan chairs in a village. We agreed to pay 1.5 yuan per sedan to carry us forty miles to the foot of the mountain. However, halfway there, the porters with bare legs and feet could not bear the cold, and at the same time, they were afraid of not being able to find their way back after dark. They voluntarily took half of their money and asked us to get off and continue on our way by ourselves. There was no way to force them, so we had to grit our teeth and run again, run again...</p>
<p>The turtle-shaped stone slab road was covered with snow, and coupled with the stiff legs that had been sitting in the sedan chair for twenty miles, we were slipping and falling from time to time. And the wind was still so strong, and the snow was still so heavy. The partners started to complain again, "We are going to give relief to the disaster victims, but now we ourselves are suffering the same hardships as the disaster victims. We are still being told that we are eating off the disaster victims, damn it! This is so infuriating. The gentlemen and ladies with charity titles at most spend some money to watch a voluntary play or participate in a disaster relief art exhibition..." A never-ending series.</p>
<p>"Forget it, "die when the goods reach the snake's head", you have to go now, you have to go even if you don't want to!"</p>
<p>Simply take off the hat, loosen the clothes, climb the mountain... The guide finally said a word to reassure people: "The Shangkengtang place in District Seven where you are staying for the night is about to arrive."</p>
<p>A vast expanse of white sky, a vast expanse of white earth. The time was six o'clock, and there was still some light in the sky. After passing the fourth mountain frog, a Mr. Ma really came down the mountain to pick us up. The partners all shook off the snow on their shoulders at the same time, and their feet also felt warm.</p>
<h3>Felling Teak</h3>
<p>— Jing Yun</p>
<p>In the early morning, the orange-red sunlight filtered through the lush green teak leaves, leaving patches of golden, shimmering sunlight on the ground.</p>
<p>Beautiful little birds, full of life, hopped on the branches, facing the orange-red sun, singing "Good Morning" songs. Looking out from the gaps in the branches and leaves, the clear and bright blue sky was filled with light, floating white clouds.</p>
<p>An endless forest, like a vast blue-green sea, was surrounded by milky-white morning mist. The mist wandered through the forest, light and thin, like smoke rising from the thatched roofs of the natives, or like the light curtains on the windows of Westerners.</p>
<p>In the forest, besides the simple music produced by saws on the teak trees, the air was as quiet as a lonely ancient temple standing in the deep mountains.</p>
<p>A gust of morning wind came down from the canopy-like teak treetops, rustling and swirling around the elderly He Xingbo, who was working below pulling a saw, making him shiver repeatedly, his body covered in goosebumps.</p>
<p>"After all, I'm getting old, old people are really useless, I can't even stand this little morning breeze." He Xingbo stopped his work and sighed unintentionally, while buttoning up the buttons on his chest. "At this time, Wanggu is hot and stuffy, but here—Bayap (Bayap is in northern Siam, more than 500 miles from Wanggu.)—the weather is already like the late autumn season." He then struck up a conversation with the local working next to him.</p>
<p>"He Xingbo, why don't you return to 'Tangshan'? Do you want to spend your whole life in Siam?" The "native," whose face was as black as charcoal, seemed to be concerned about the elderly He Xingbo, who had left his hometown and was living a wandering life in a "foreign land." "Isn't that right? After a hundred years, a person's bones must return to their 'homeland' to be at peace!" He then took out a prepared "betel quid" from his pocket, added a piece of betel nut, and chewed it with great relish.</p>
<p>"Return to 'Tangshan,'... 'Tangshan,' I have nothing!"</p>
<p>This clearly stirred up a long-forgotten matter in He Xingbo's heart, causing it to resurface. He repeated, saying: a worm of melancholy suddenly crawled onto his face, which was covered with a layer like dried bean curd skin.</p>
<p>"What? Isn't there a son in your home in Tangshan?"</p>
<p>"He died early!"</p>
<p>"Then, what about a daughter-in-law?"</p>
<p>"How can a poor family keep a young woman? Before her husband had even been dead for a hundred days, she went off with someone else!..." He Xingbo's face became even more melancholy and ugly, gloomy like the sky on a rainy day.</p>
<p>"Tui," the native spat out a mouthful of blood-like saliva, then pulled out two Silver Root Hidemeng brand cigarettes from his pocket, struck a match, and handed one to He Xingbo. Then, wisps of mist-like white smoke leisurely puffed out of their mouths.</p>
<p>Rustling, the teak trees again played simple music under the saw, but in He Xingbo's heart, he was filled with sorrow, softly lamenting his uncertain fate, like the teak being taken away from the forest, drifting everywhere. ...…</p>

<p>Opening "Vanity"</p>
<p>The inner chamber is most fond of vanity. On ordinary days, they only pay attention to the refinement of their clothes. They don't know that it's difficult times and they should cherish material resources. They rely entirely on their desire to compete and show off. They must know that they are harming the younger generation. They lightly put important matters behind them. Dressing fashionably makes them happy. Seeing other people's styles gives rise to envy. It is necessary to reach the wish in the heart from afar. So as to avoid chest and intestines that are worried and make it impossible to fulfill their wishes. They will inevitably have endless storms of resentment that are difficult to calm. If there is a banquet, they are very busy. They think of all kinds of colors and essences. The outfit must be able to stand out from the crowd. Then they are happy and content. If they are not as good as others, they will have frowning eyebrows and horizontal regrets. It is a pity that vanity is momentary. Why admire empty fame so much. Even men are fond of vanity. Praising the family and calling themselves tycoons. They drive cars and motorcycles. They live in洋房 of thirteen stories. Foolish words to blow one's own horn. However, the listeners are really fascinated. Thus, they come to curry favor and make friends. How is it possible to get people coveting? One should not be frivolous and presumptuous. One must take the two words of vanity lightly. If we young people can realize this, why worry that national affairs will not recover? The thousand-gold daughters of noble families are best known for their quiet and gentle reputation. Throwing away vanity can last a lifetime. All day long, they compete for beauty. What is the benefit of loving lead wash? Why should you put your thoughts on jewels? After all, it is good to leave a name for thousands of years. It can be admired and have a good reputation. Do not take these words lightly.</p>

<h3>The Exciting Revolution of 1935: "Color Films" Will Replace Sound Films</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiabo</p>
<p>1935 may be another memorable revolutionary milestone in the history of world cinema!</p>
<p>In any case, Hollywood has made considerable preparations and is quietly awaiting the outbreak of this revolution. The last major revolution in the film industry was seven years ago. At that time, "The Jazz Singer" suddenly turned Hollywood's film industry into sound films, making silent films relics of the past. Major film companies had to quickly raise an extra 100 million yuan in capital to engage in the production of sound films. At that time, the Hollywood film industry was fundamentally shaken, causing all producers, film merchants, directors, stars, etc., to lose color in their faces.</p>
<p>Now 1935 is already among us. Hollywood, or perhaps not just Hollywood, is once again in a state of panic. They know that the changes of the times are inevitable, and the revolutionary tide is irreversible. But this change affects the entire film industry, how can they not reminisce about the past and talk about tigers?</p>
<p>However, the last time it was sound films that revolutionized silent films. What will revolutionize sound films this time? Not Television or broadcast movies. That period still needs to wait a few more years. The hero rising now is color films!</p>
<p>Now the people in Hollywood, no matter who they are, no matter where they are, they start and end their conversations with color. What two-component color, what three-component color, can be heard everywhere, making outsiders feel that the people in Hollywood are all in a frenzy. In fact, how can they not be afraid? Isn't this a phenomenon of "the mountain rain is coming, and the wind fills the tower"?</p>
<p>Some people say that the upcoming era of color films may be even greater than the era of sound films we have already seen. Why? Sound films are certainly a major change and a major advancement, but, taking the world as a whole, we must know that only 65 percent of the world's cinemas have sound film projection equipment. However, when color films come out, all cinemas can be without the need to add special equipment. Wouldn't the future color films be more popular than the current sound films?</p>
<p>In fact, in the past year, 1934, and the beginning of this year, we have already seen a part of the face of this emerging color film. That is the scene of the final audience with the British court in George Arliss' "The House of Rothschild," and the scene of the large ice cream bucket in Eddie Cantor's "Kid Millions." The beauty and harmony of the colors we saw in these two scenes were far beyond our expectations. Because this color photography technique is the "three-component color" photography technique mentioned above. Prior to this, what we saw was only "two-component color," which only had red and green colors. In the "two-component color" photography technique, only two colors are available, so the result is extremely unsatisfactory, and everything except large red and large green colors is dim and dull. Now, after the invention of the "three-component color" photography technique, the color distribution is extremely harmonious, and the color range is much wider.</p>
<p>In this era of improvement, we cannot fail to mention the names of two great men. One is the inventor of "three-component color," Dr. Herbert T. Kalmus, and the other is the creator of Mickey Mouse, Walt Disney. As early as more than 20 years ago, in 1914, Kalmus gathered many like-minded people and organized a research institute to specifically explore methods of color projection on the screen. They were all graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They later invented a color photography method and adopted their alma mater's nickname (Tech), calling the newly invented color photography technique Technicolor.</p>
<p>Progress is very slow. But in 1921, they used "Technicolor" to make a film for the first time. Of course, from a commercial standpoint, it didn't achieve any success. But they still moved forward relentlessly, and many color and photography experts in the United States also helped them wholeheartedly, making them even more inspired and energetic. After sound films became popular in 1927, they felt the necessity of color in films even more. It is true that there are several song and dance films that have added color interludes, which increased the audience's interest a lot.</p>
<p>In the recent five or six years, the application of Technicolor has stagnated, and the revolution of color films has been hindered until now. The reason is that there were not many cameras that could shoot color films to meet the needs of the film industry. There were also not many technical talents available for the employment of various companies. But during this period, Kalmus and his team achieved amazing success in their research! That is, they advanced from the two-component color of red and green to the three-component color of red, yellow, and blue.</p>
<p>Walt Disney's contribution is also very considerable. After Kalmus' experiment was successful, and all the filmmakers were hesitating due to their disappointment with the previous two-component color, he resolutely signed a one-year patent contract with Kalmus. Walt Disney wanted to make a full-color feature film in these few months. He said: "I don't want to turn Mickey Mouse or the Silly Symphonies into color films. I want to go one step further and make a full-length comedy film, using color to shoot it."</p>
<p>Okay, let's watch. Let us quietly await the arrival of this brand-new era of color films!</p>
<h3>Hollywood Figures' Impressions of China</h3>
<p>— Yimin</p>
<p>Historically, the United States has viewed China as an extremely uncivilized country, where men still wear queues and women still bind their feet. They believe that Chinatown is the only representative place in China. Therefore, almost all films depicting the social conditions of China have disgusting ugliness.</p>
<p>People in Hollywood are also not aware of the state of China. Because of the decline of China's international status, they have developed a contemptuous mentality. However, in recent years, there are more and more Hollywood people who understand China. They came to China to visit with curiosity and returned with a very good impression. The following are these people's impressions of China:</p>
<p>Liliana Damita once visited Beiping, China. She has a very detailed study of Beiping's people and customs. She often said to people: "Beiping, China, is indeed a famous city in world history. I have been to the old palace. I believe that China is indeed an advancing country. The people of Beiping are all kind and friendly. The clerks in the shops are like German merchants, friendly and polite. I only stayed in Beiping for more than three months, which made me extremely reluctant to leave. The scenery of Beiping is even better. There are many places that Hollywood doesn't have. Even now, I still miss that ancient city with its simple and honest customs."</p>
<p>Laura La Plante has an even deeper impression of China. She grew up in Hong Kong. She lived in various places in Guangdong. She can speak fluent Cantonese. She has worked as a stage actress in Guangdong. She knows the social conditions of China very well. Her view is: "China has its own unique human relationships and customs. The old morality of the Chinese people is very strict. The Chinese people attach great importance to politeness. Although general education is not universal in China, the people of the lower classes also have very good etiquette. The other thing is credit. Chinese merchants often do not sign any contracts or agreements when doing business with each other. They have a word for it, and at that time they will definitely deliver the goods and pay the money, with very few unexpected disputes."</p>
<p>William Powell has the following views on China: "I have been to the north and south of China. My view on Guangdong is that it is the most civilized place in China. The people in Guangdong have a spirit of adventure, which is a unique characteristic and is not as good as people in other provinces. Shanghai is just an important place for cultural and material transportation. It is also the most prosperous place in the East. Even China's film industry is mostly concentrated here. Beiping and Tianjin are both very good places that retain China's unique customs. The loyalty of the people and the simplicity of the customs have their own beauty. When I arrived in Beiping, I hoped that China's film city would be in Beiping, and the Hollywood of the East might be in Beiping."</p>
<p>Ann Harding and Robert Montgomery, who starred in "Diary of a Chambermaid," are making a big collaboration again. ——Nanjing Screening</p>
<h3>"The Fugitive" is Scheduled for Public Release</h3>
<p>The latest contribution from Yihua Company, directed by Yue Feng, filmed by Wu Weiyun, set designed by Fang Peilin, starring Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Ye Juanjuan, Yuan Congmei, Qin Tong, Chen Juanjuan, Qiu Yuanyuan, etc., and actually filmed in the areas of Chahar and Suiyuan, "The Fugitive" has now been completely filmed, and is being actively dubbed and songs are being interspersed. It can be sent to Beijing for inspection soon, and it is expected that it will be publicly released in the largest theater in this city in late this month.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang's Secret Magic Power</h3>
<p>Since the public premiere of "Mr. Wang's Secret," viewers from all walks of life have praised it unanimously, not only praising it as the king of domestic comedies, but also occupying a place in the world of comedies. In recent days, all dance halls, banquets, and various social occasions have used this film as a topic of conversation. Its magic power is unprecedented. It is reported that the film is scheduled to be released in the Jincheng Theater this Friday. At that time, there will be a unprecedented scene of traffic and crowds.</p>
<h3>Moscow to Build a 20,000-Seat Grand Theater</h3>
<p>Moscow, the capital of Soviet Russia, is currently constructing the world's largest cinema. The cinema is being built in the "Entertainment" park, covering an area of two acres. Once completed, it will be able to accommodate 20,000 spectators. The theater is also planning to install a 500-square-foot screen and purchase projection and sound equipment with a million candlepower from abroad, as Soviet Russia is not yet able to manufacture such powerful equipment itself. All thirty major theaters in Moscow are usually full, so seats must be reserved several hours before each show, and for popular films, reservations must be made a day in advance. Recently, the most distinctive films shown have been "Tchabaeff" and "Gay Fellow." "Tchabaeff" is a historical film depicting Russian military heroes. "Gay Fellow," on the other hand, is purely a comedy without any propaganda content. Both films are comparable to "The Thief of Bagdad," starring Douglas Fairbanks, which broke audience records several years ago. Few British and American films are shown in Moscow, and those that are are mostly old films.</p>

<h3>National Call (Bordertown) (7)</h3>
<p>— Xue</p>
<p>After a sudden change in her body and face, Marie Roark suddenly screamed, "You—if it weren't for me, you'd still be a waiter at the Silver Shoe. I made you rich! The clothes you wear, I gave them to you. Now—you just washed your neck and think you're a high-class person. No one can do that—you're born a lowly thing—just like me. You belong to me—don't even think about leaving me!" Johnny clenched his teeth and slowly said, "No, I can't be with you. I know what kind of person I want. You can't control me. I'm going up." Marie shouted, "What right does she have over you? You belong to me. I'll never let go! I committed murder for you!"</p>
<p>Johnny asked strangely, "What? What crime did you commit?" Marie said, "I killed him—I killed him. It was for you." Johnny, looking dismissive, slowly said, "Looking at you gives me a headache. From now on, be careful, know what's good for you, stay far away from this place, far away from me." After he finished speaking, he went out to look for Dale Elwell, but the moonlight still shone brightly in the greenhouse, and his sweetheart was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Perhaps Dale didn't think about meeting him again. Perhaps in Dale's heart, there was no trace of Johnny Ramirez. Indeed, the next day when Johnny went to the Elwell residence to visit her, Elwell's butler tried to stop him, but the current Johnny was not someone the butler could stop. When he went inside and met Dale, Dale couldn't help but laugh. She readily agreed to go for a ride with him in his new car. In his straightforward and love-struck eyes, what other explanation could there be for her behavior?</p>
<p>One afternoon, Johnny happily walked into his office. He saw Marie sitting on his desk. Johnny frowned and said, "Didn't I tell you to come here less?" Marie smiled and said, "Is the great lover so busy that no one is here to take care of things?" Johnny said, "Okay, please take care of things more often from now on. I'm going back to the old place." Marie controlled herself and said with a smile, "Oh, so you've already discussed it with that woman. You must be very happy, right?" Johnny casually said, "Yeah, couldn't be happier. After I sign the checks and pay the salaries, I'm going back to the old place to open an even bigger one. She invited me to go out and play for a few days. When we come back, we're going to get engaged."</p>
<p>As Johnny spoke, his back was to Marie, so he didn't see the change in Marie's face, the burning anger in her heart, which made her face look terribly strange. He only heard Marie say, "Since things have come to this, I can only let you go... but I wish you a happy future." As she spoke, she reached out her hand. Johnny didn't understand what she meant, but he couldn't辜負 her kindness, so he also reached out his hand and shook hers. Marie continued, "I'm saying this from the bottom of my heart. I'd rather see you rise step by step. I'd rather see you have endless happiness."</p>
<p>These words gradually made him feel uneasy. He let go of her hand and said, "I have a lot of things to do. I need to hurry. I need to pack Golf's clothes and the tuxedo... See you later." Marie said kindly, "Okay, Johnny, see you later." The smile on her face remained until Johnny went out. However, as soon as the door closed, her face changed again. She muttered to herself, "... He told me to kill him—Johnny Ramirez—he said if I didn't do it, he would beat me to death—I was afraid of him—I had to do it—Johnny wanted the money—he knew that when he died, the money would be in his hands—" Will this plan succeed? Her cunning mind pondered. (To be continued)</p>
