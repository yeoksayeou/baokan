<h3>歐洲金本位集團之動搖</h3>
<p>— （冷觀）</p>
<p>最近比利時內閣改組。齊倫就新總理職。在衆議院宣布大政方針。其與幣制有關之設施如左列各項。</p>
<p>（一）暫停兌現。</p>
<p>（二）貶低幣値百分之二十五。期與英鎊保相當之比價。自三月三十一日起實行。</p>
<p>（三）創設匯兌平準基金。</p>
<p>（四）擬開國際會議。謀列邦貨幣之穩定。</p>
<p>此案業由比國衆院於三月三十日通過。並由參院於同日批准。當上述方針未宣布時。比政府先令交易所停業三日。衆料比國幣値卽將减低。匯兌市面大起風波。比幣跌至二十四佛郎合一鎊。比國向輸出大宗鋼鐵及水泥。自英鎊跌價。銷路大减今比佛郎之减値已成事實。此等比貨便可在英國境內及海外與英貨競爭。其受影響尤芸者。爲法國之經濟界。比利時原與法國同在金本位集團（TheGoldBloc）之列。比幣减値。法人之擁護金佛郎者自不免氣餒。其持有法國債券者。將出售於市。改購外國證券。資本逃避情事恐不能免。法國此後能否堅持金本位。未可知也。</p>
<p>考金本位集團之產生。在一九三三年七月三日。其時倫敦開世界經濟會議。美國代表反對穩定國際匯兌。致會議無結果而散。法比等國相約發表宣言。力主維持金本位。去年十月間。參加此集團者。計有怯蘭西·意大利·荷蘭·比利時·瑞士·盧森堡·波蘭·六國。舉行會議於比京。仍保持固有宗旨。並擬促進諾國間之貿易。其具體辦法。未卽决定。諸國在貨幣戰爭劇烈之際。所以有此金集團者。因恐放棄金本位。通貨必致膨脹。將蹈大戰時貨幣混亂之覆轍。但欲維持永久。亦頗困難。他國藉减低幣値手段。競爭傾銷法比等國幣値較高。輸出製造品。不堪與之競爭。近來金集團中諸國。商務較前退步。未始不由於此也。比利時本爲集團中堅。一旦首先脫離。放棄金本位。一髮牽動全身。影響頗非淺尠。此後趨勢若何。可分悲觀樂觀二說其。持悲觀說者謂集團瓦解。旣肇其端。他國勢必效尤。法國存金雖多。處此環境之中。安能堅持初旨。鎮定不搖。設竟步比後塵。貨幣戰爭之情勢。愈見嚴重。國祭糾紛愈不可解。非常時期益將逼近矣。其持樂觀說者。謂比幣貶値。參加集團之他國。未必效尤。據上月二十九日路透電傳。荷蘭政府仍擬保護「福祿林」（荷幣）。竭力裁威預算。務求收支適合。俾免因財政支绌牽動金融。荷國態度如此。法蘭西安肯輕舉妄動耶。卽使金本位集團從此解散。安知國際穩定貨幣之時機。非藉比國此舉以促成之耶。</p>
<p>以上二說。孰是孰非。自有將來之事實蹬明姑不具論。顧否人以爲目下値得注意者約有二端。（一）由比國之放棄金本位。足見歐陸之金本位集團。已有破綻。而貨幣戰爭之日趨激化。實使金本位集團發生破綻之一大原因。（二）消息傳來。比國自放棄金本位後。物價高漲。社會頗戚不安。故共國內反對新閣此項政策者頗多。我國經濟狀况。與英美日比等國逈不相同。對於幣制自不能輕易變更。致生紛擾。我國通貨政策幸無變動。貨幣制度亦無更張。故在此經濟恐慌期中。工商各業。均能從容應付。力謀自救設若效法彼邦。膨脹通貨。貶低幣値。竊恐實效未見而流弊先滋矣。</p>

<h3>艾登在華沙酬酢　昨晨晤波蘭外長　應波總統午宴下午訪畢蘇斯基　英俄協調使德國深感顯著不安</h3>
<p>華沙　英掌爾大臣艾登、定今晨十一時與波蘭外長貝克大佐、討論二月三日英法公報中所述之各點、今似可豫决者、貝克大佐必切實聲明波蘭對東歐公約之異議、蓋波蘭與德國、多數以爲雙方面的協定於增進安全更有價値、庶波蘭可免被牽入彼所視爲可避的爭端也、</p>
<p>艾登於昨晚八時抵此、大受歡迎、到站恭迓者、有外長貝克、波蘭駐英大使賴克凈斯基、英國駐波大使康那德、及英大使暑職員等、艾登在此之談話、將於星期三日終止、然後卽將赴捷克首都柏拉格、作簡短之交換意見、而於星期四晚、乘飛機返倫敦、報告此行之結果、與英外相西門提出之報告、同由英內閣審慎研究之、此次聘間諸國、藉以得諗當局之意見、此行原爲探討性質、並未欲獲具體之結果、故今達此階段、可謂如願以償矣、至於英政府對於歐洲俶擾之大局、不致卽有表白、因一切事務尚須由英法意三國政治家於下星期中開會、通盤計盡、而後數日內國聯行政院亦將開會交換意見也、三國會議之地點、己决定在斯特里薩之著名第十七世紀波羅摩宮、宮中有意國最華美之廳堂、其地風景極佳、（二日路透電）</p>

<p>艾登折衷主張</p>
<p>華沙　英國掌璽大臣艾登、今晨與波蘭外長柏克、討論東歐互助公約問題、繼乃拜訪波蘭國務總理期拉威克、並赴大總統莫錫斯墓之午宴、午後則將拜訪波蘭獨裁者陸軍部長畢蘇斯基、明日艾登卽行啟程赴捷克京城、是爲艾登最後聘問之地、其行程乃告終於是焉、本日波蘭某高級官員、曾向哈瓦斯社宣稱、謂「波蘭對於立陶宛之領士完整、認爲有切身之關係、有如英國之於比利時」云、因此傳聞波蘭對於德國向東發展之計盡、具有深刻印象、倘東歐互助公約能改成軟性之條欵、又英國或可加入與中歐相同之約束、波蘭領土完整遭威脅時、英國可參預各國間之諮詢手績、苟如是、則波蘭或有加入東歐互助公約之可能云、消息靈通方面相信、艾登或將提議一種折衷的東歐安全計畫、蓋波蘭政府始終不許外國軍隊、開入波蘭境內、因此艾登主張互助條欵、僅以天空爲限、遇發生侵略行動時、波蘭政府淮許未來東歐公約簽字國之飛機隊、飛經波蘭領士、但禁止他國軍隊開入波蘭領土、如是或可爲波蘭所接受云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>會談提出方案</p>
<p>今晨十一時、艾登與波蘭外長貝克大佐會談、所討論之範圍、包括二月三日英法公報中所述各點、至其討論情形、未有宣露、現信貝克曾聲明蘇俄所疑波蘭已與德國締結聯盟、以担禦俄國侵略爲主旨一節、實無根據、淡話至正午終止、艾登卽赴波蘭總統莫息基之宴、午後將與陸長舉蘇資基上將在比爾維地爾宮侖談、果氏輒喜於茶時見客、淡時頻頻進茗、而忘其杯數、令日與英貴賓傾談、似將以茶代酒、舉杯爲壽也、晚問貝克將開宴爲艾登洗塵</p>
<p>路透訪員今日探悉、關於波德聯盟一節、波蘭陸軍參謀部仍反對此舉、波蘭似不欲立卽明白拒绝東歐公約、惟覺共與鄰邦所訂雙方的互不侵犯協定、應併入該公約方案中、現信今晨兩政治家談話之際、貝克曾提出切實之方案、使東歐公約能爲波蘭所接受、而不予德國以反對之口實、此或爲討論中雙方意見主要乏異點、聞波蘭領袖今覺不得不取决斷的步驟、因反對黨力主波蘭應釋明共外交政策也、聞今晨談話時、艾登曾說明其在柏林莫斯科與當局接晤之情形、於是見克乃解釋波蘭對所計論各問題之立塲、並稱、波蘭政府已邀法外長賴伐爾東遊華沙云、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>華沙　今晨英國掌　火臣艾登、與外長柏克、舉行談話時、首由艾澄詳細說明在柏林、莫斯科兩處所獲得之印象、及消息、繼由柏克縷述波蘭政府對於東歐互助公約之觀點、據可靠消息、艾登與柏克、頃已草擬一種折衷方式、創以業經簽訂之互不侵犯條　爲基礎、而加入「不援助侵略國」及「侵略國定義」等條欵、同時並訂結一種諮詢公約、俾與保障奧國獨立之諮詢公約相同、消息靈通方面、以爲此種東歐諮詢公約、英國不致拒絕參加、因而政界方面、業己表示樂觀、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>波蘭所持態度</p>
<p>華沙　英國掌璽大臣艾登業已抵此、雙方談話、卽將開始舉行、波蘭政府因受近日經過事件之影響、對於東歐互助公約所持態度、或則準備加以變更、至少或當重行加以考慮、波蘭對于德國向東發展計畫、而爲該國元首希特勒所不深諱者、威覺深切印象、因此消息靈通方面、以爲東歐公約、若能以一種柔性方案替代互助條欵、或者英國關於保障波蘭領土完整一舉、能接受諾言、參加諮詢手績、如關於奧國頒土完整所爲、則波蘭政府、必準備簽訂東歐公約云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙　半官式波蘭驛報、評論英國掌　大臣艾登訪問之舉、謂華沙旣以同情心理表示歡迎、又復認識當前時局之重要性、其言日、「國際聯合會制度、已屆生死關頭、救補之方、不出兩途、其一注重現實事態、以謀改進、其一樹立新制度、但第二途較爲困難、」該報又謂、英波兩國空氣、實相類似、「波蘭政策、雖不失之躁急、究亦不漠視時局之嚴重性、好在英波兩國政策所抱之目的、與所採用之方式、均以鎮靜審慎爲歸宿、而英國閣員、自倫敦道經巴黎、柏林、莫斯科、以至華沙、所循路綫、卽屬和平事業之中心軸也云云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>德國深感不安</p>
<p>（柏林）英俄兩國對於鞏固歐洲和平之適當方法、意見一致、今日已使德國大感不安、政府在表面上雖不承認掌璽大臣艾登在莫斯科會議之成就、惟艾登之凱旋盛况及連日所公布兩國對於各項國際問題之協調、已使公衆戚想有顯著不安之狀、至於希特勒與西門之會議、則確無成就、德國對於廢棄和約重整軍備一事、頗欲維持英國之善意、因法意兩國己提出嚴重抗議、大概對於德國計盡將竭盡阻撓之能事也、同時德國之軍隊動員、及製造大砲飛機等之計劃、仍繼續進行、他國之威想如何、殊非希特勒所計也、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>法報輿論一斑</p>
<p>（巴黎）各報追述莫斯科談話經過、咸皆表示滿意、并希望波蘭對於東歐互助公約計盡、能變更原來態度、「事業」報以爲蘇俄勢當與西歐英法意三大國簽訂四國公約、而任德國自行加入、並謂英國西門外相或於法國外長賴伐爾赴俄之前、召集歐洲會議、此項會議、會盛傳一時、屆時參加者併德國在內、當有八國至十國之多、巴黎迥聲報載稱、英國不擬加入東歐互助公約、但接受他項辦法、例如東歐方面若有侵略情事發生、則英國願會同其他各國互相諮詢是也、該報并謂、「據聞英國掌璽大臣艾登、曾向蘇俄共產黨祕書史丹林提出保證、德國若果攻擊東鄰某一國、而法國因同盟關係、出而干涉時、則英國對於此種干涉行動、並不認爲違反羅卡諾公約」「晨報」謂、德國整軍經武、咄咄逼人、波蘭將因而改變態度、願與蘇聯同時參加東歐互助公約、「小日報」亦謂此項公約、波蘭願與蘇聯同時參加云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>東亞與祥和合作　毛織業堅固之陣容</h3>
<p>我國實業、日趨上進、各項工廠、亦日異增多、如此則資財之運用、可云已上軌道、然因營業方法之各異、蒸蒸日上者有之、中途失敗者亦頗不少、觀我國毛織事業、是目下之最需要者、惟是項工廠、尙屬罕見、雖已有數家、亦寥若晨星、聞毛綫工廠、僅有天津東亞毛呢紡織公司、及前之天津祥和紡毛廠二家、</p>
<p>天津祥和紡毛廠、於民國二十三年開始計劃開辦、以有限資本、設廠於天津法租界、出品飛機牌毛綫、尙稱不惡、卒因其缺乏營業之法、又無改進貨質之能、且人才及資本之薄弱、無能與外國競爭、終不能支、並於今春停業、前特向其同業天津東亞毛呢紡織股份公司、請求商洽合併、經變方認可、由犬津東亞廠方出資、將祥和原有全部購得、改名爲大津東亞毛呢紡織股份有限公司第一分廠、現手續均已辦妥、日前巳正式接收矣、</p>
<p>天津東亞毛呢紡織股份有限公司者、乃國內最大唯一之毛綫工廠、其創辦人宋君等、曾從事於毛織業有年、宋君曾留學歐西、凡三次專門研究毛織並在國外毛織名廠服務多年、非但於毛織學識、已有深得、且對毛織營業及購買機器等項、均有深刻之研究、與經騐、其抱定振興我國毛織業之大志、已有二十載之歷史、先後在濟南等處、曾試辦數次、均已失敗、其所受之打擊及經過之困難、可云無微不至、其得有着實之把握後、遂再接再厲、於民國二十一年、開該廠於天津、於二十二年初、始正式全部開工、其出品爲抵羊牌毛綫純係國產、因其廠方人才濟濟、各有專門學識、一致團結、努力不息、兼有各方愛國同志之協助、及政府之指導、始能於最短期內、遍銷全國各地、名貫南北堪稱舶來品之勁敵、其出品之精美、非特已得國人之贊許與同情、至外貨原有覇佔之我國市塲、亦全部動搖、逐漸退避、</p>
<p>此次東亞與祥和之合作、換言之、即爲東亞工廠內部之擴充、先是祥和之成立、我毛織業本又生一臂、不幸中途失敗、今之合作、其勢力並不稍减、或可藉而增加、是項大規模之工廠、乃我國目下所最需要者、故將來其地位之重要、更當擴大提倡、深希是類工廠、能日漸增多、以挽利權、然刻於外貨遍佈推銷、於我國內地、百般設計、相盡方法、以吸引國人之購買心理、甘願解囊輸金錢於國外、而不自覺之時期、我國各項工廠之開設、亦當小心從事、非有實際之經驗、純正之學識、高尙之見地、及雄厚之資本、各方佈置週密、使不能輕易挫折之把握、不能人手、如此、或能藉政府之協助、及社會人士之提倡、　須有向外貨奮力競爭之特長、僥倖存在、萬不能因一時之興奮、或觀一時之小利、不顧一切弊害、盲從舉辦、致徒耗資財、非但損失甚鉅、且能遺害同業、徒受外人之譏笑也、「東亞」「祥和」二廠之合作、基礎旣堅、希能努力經營、不難執毛織業之牛耳也、</p>

<p>市長演說</p>
<p>各位先生、此次兄弟與社會局吳局長主持上海市第一次集團結婚典禮、實在覺得是終身莫大榮幸之事、中國自革命以後、關於舊的禮制有很多已不合時代的精神、不復適用、新的禮制、我們一時沒有完全制定、因此社會方面、關於婚喪喜慶的種種禮節、都是沒有一定的規則、從而形成一種凌亂無章的狀態、但是中國奮有的禮節太繁瑣、婚喪喜慶是任何人一生所不能避免的事、因此我們往往因爲婚喪喜慶化費了不少的金錢時間、甚至社會上還有許多人、將畢生省儉積蓄所得的錢、壽化於這些婚喪喜慶的人生大事上面、所以不但禮節　瑣、且又太不經濟、本市政府有鑒及此、特提倡集團結婚、集團結婚有三個大的目的、第一是節單、第二是經濟、第三是莊嚴、而其中尤以莊嚴爲最重要、因爲凡是一個禮節、不論簡單繁瑣、却都不能不莊嚴、如果一個典禮不莊嚴、其典禮將不成其爲典禮、故我們希望在舉行集團結婚典禮的時候、不但結婚人新郎新娘要知逍典禮之隆重、要維持典禮的莊嚴、同時男女來賓覜衆、也一定要遵守禮堂的規則、維持莊嚴的秩序、以期集團結婚的風氣、由此開端、逐漸普遍化而使我國舊有的禮節、都隨集關結婚而有所改善、今天我們所以在此舉行演習、原因是因爲集團結婚在中國是創舉、在上海也是第一次、不獨新郎新娘這一對一對的新人沒有這種新的經騐、同時我們證婚人與辦事的人、也都缺乏經騐、故爲求典禮隆重與莊嚴起見、我們不得不提早一天來演習、今天演習的情形、大致都很好、不過有幾點不對的地方、希望新郎新娘留意改正、總之我們一定要遵守禮堂的規則和秩序、保持婚禮的隆重與莊嚴、</p>
<p>觀衆興奮</p>
<p>各界瞻觀斯項新生活結婚創舉者、頗感興奮、吳市長及全體職員、均循循指導、市長並諭鞠躬時須四十五度、携手及退下之姿勢應如何、且與兪鴻鈞親自實習、以供仿效、且作簡單訓話謂、中國自革命以來、一切舊有判度之不適宜者、均應加以革新、新生活集團結婚、卽爲改革繁瑣禮制之一種、其要點有三、（一）簡單、（二）節儉、（三）壯嚴、除節省時間經濟外、尤應壯嚴、以重精神、此番爲演習、願諸位抱學而時習之情神、</p>
<p>迎接新人</p>
<p>今日下午、市府仍在大世界及賓山路口、以汽車迎接結婚人、市中心區之交通、由該處公安分局派警維持、並指定觀禮者由後門入內、禮畢後、將由吳市長及吳局長在市府膳廳、欵以茶點、</p>

<h3>北平女子訴夫離婚　瀝述侮辱虐待情事　乃夫劉厚載自稱本人係世代書香　兩人感情並不惡劣必係家庭包圍　庭論出外試行和解改期再訊</h3>
<p>北平女子何敏、現年廿一歲、向在原籍溫泉中學攻讀、其長兄何森任職中國銀行、二兄何炎、任職職上海利興洋行、民二十年、何炎患病、乏人照料、乃電平招其妹來滬、並以何敏初來上海、路途不熟、故託前中法工專同學現任國定稅則委員會職員之丹徒人劉厚載（三十一歲）至車站代接、乃劉自見何敏後、以其姿色頗佳、且受相當敎育、擬與之作永久伴侶、深恐何炎反對、遂處心積慮、以代何敏補習學問爲由、時令伊至家、某日何敏至劉處時、適其室內並無一人、劉卽將門關閉、意欲求歡、何堅拒不允、奈劉素習武、孔武有才、房中置有</p>
<p>刀劍等物</p>
<p>劉乃用以威嚇、何本欲呼喊、但爲顧全顏面計、祗以力拒、結果因力不能勝、遂被姦汚、乃後何等不敢聲張、詎劉翌日卽往何放之母何朱鑑堂處求婚、幾經設法、始逹目的、爰於二十年十月在大中華飯店舉行婚禮、由褚民誼證婚、自結婚以後、何敏曾繼續在愛國女學。東亞體專攻讀、終因劉不付學費而輟學、最初雙方情感、尙能維持、後劉</p>
<p>態度突變</p>
<p>不時将何女虐待歐打、劉有時出外表演武術、亦必責令同往演技、並不時需索銀錢、不從則遭痛毆、去年夏間、曾將何女衣服盡行剝去、赤條條令立　於陽台之上、任人觀看、某日被告家愛文義路一四五五號對面爲一西人公寓、何女抱其所生之女立於窗前、公寓中之西人訽孩幾歲時、爲劉所見、卽將女衣衫褫盡、已亦將衣褲脫去、推開窗戶、强行苟且之事、使</p>
<p>對面西人</p>
<p>多人觀看、嗣女由黃河淸之介紹、在一美國人處敎授國語、每月可得六十元、半數津貼劉家之甩、半則爲所生二女（長二歲、次九月、）衣着之用、旋該美人赴港、女亦隨往、後該美人回國、何始回滬、以不堪劉之虐待、遂延黃人龍、郭南强、二律師具狀第一特區法院民庭、請求與劉離異、並償還借欵一千元、衣服等物一千元、及二女敎育費至二十歲止、計二萬零一百六十元、及本人贍養費一萬四千四百元、旋因本人能以</p>
<p>敎讀爲生</p>
<p>故對於贍養費自願拋棄、昨午後、由彭時推事開民十四庭傳訉、何敏歷陳以上事實、並稱被告前曾書一字據、謂永遠不打何敏、及後彼打我時、我卽將該紙給閱、彼謂非我欲打你、乃有鬼附也、且將該據撕毀、同時將親筆所書被虐待侮辱情形文呈案、洋洋數千言、而黃人龍律師又提出劉致原告信一封、內</p>
<p>表示悔過</p>
<p>意、以證明確有虐待之事、詰之劉厚載稱、我家亦係世代書香、決不能作原告所述之事、本案原告之要求離異、以我意度之、必非出於自願、或係家庭之包圍、因我倆結合、其二兄反對頗烈、且我倆之感情、並不惡劣也、庭上核供、乃諭改期再訊、並着二造試行和解、</p>

<h3>金城銀行二十三年份營業報告　（二）（十）</h3>
<p>至本年絲價、較之民二十二年、幾有半數之差、與二十年則不能倫比、譬如上等滬經、民國二十二年、最高價每担一·〇〇〇元、最低價六三〇元者、本年最高價僅七百元、最低價四八〇元、中等川經、二十二年、最高價九〇〇元、最低價六四〇元、本年最高價僅六五〇元、最低三九〇元、但絲價雖跌、國外銷塲、依然不振、本年全年出口數量爲九五·四一三公担、較二十二年減少二〇·二九四公担、或百分之一七·五四、出口値二八·四二三·六三九元、較二十年减少二八·二九二·四二七元、當百分之四九·九七、至滯銷之原因有三、（一）最大者爲國外市塲存絲甚多、如美國本年存絲多至九六·七八七包、而銷用量僅二六·九五六包、因之需要大减、（二）日絲美銷减少、轉向法國傾銷、華絲遂受排擠、（三）南洋羣島等地、稅收奇重、推銷困難、至銀價高漲、金滙放長尤爲華絲外銷之陣礙、唯本年內銷、因價格低廉、較前略有增進、江浙兩省用絲量、估計亦在二萬包以上、至絲織品類、因同業競爭、二十二年緞類每碼二元六七角者、本年只需一元七八角、綢類二十二年每碼一元五六角者、本年只需八九角、絲銷雖增、價賤仍無濟於事、蓋非政府下最大决心、絲織同業互相提携、及國際貨幣戰爭告一段落後、絲業前途殊甚黯淡也、</p>
<p>（三）麵粉業我國麵粉業、以上海天津無錫漢口爲中心、本年開工者九十三廠、據稅務署之統計、一月至九月間、生產數量爲四六·二八三·三九三包、較上年同期增百分之一一·二五、銷售量爲五二·八〇〇·四八三包、較上年同期减少百分之二·九四、生產增而銷售减、因之存底豐厚、市價步　、以標粉言、五月每包曾跌至最低價一·九三三元、六月以後、因久旱不雨、同時美國及加拿大小麥亦告歉收、價乃漸漲、九月間、新穀登塲、米價下跌粉價隨之疲軟、加之國外粉市、跌多漲少、市上存粉、又告充斥、粉價乃又趨下落、統計全年標粉、平均價每包二·四〇九元、較二十二年徵跌百分之·〇三、</p>
<p>以上係就我國規模較大之工業而言、若火柴·捲烟·造紙·搪瓷·橡膠·熱水瓶·化妝品·針織·等業、或以稅率加重、或以外商傾銷、或以同業競爭、皆銷路不振、每况愈下、唯榨油水泥煤業等、尙有欣欣向榮之勢、一般商業、因物價跌落、開支浩繁、均屬虧多盈少、因週轉不靈、而倒閉者、爲數不少例如本年平均、天津每月約有二三百家、徐州倒閉之商店已六七百家、僅存一千六百餘家、蓋整個經濟狀態如此、非盡人謀之不臧也、（未完）</p>

<p>近年來「復古」運動大時髦，我猜想，這班人將來也許會生出一個尾巴來，像還沒有人類以前的猿猴一樣。</p>
<p>社會上高呼「失業」的人，他們的生活，大都要比一天到晚工作着，而食不能他衣不能暖的勞動者優裕得多。</p>
<p>電影教育成績最好的，是摩登女郎　倣一般明星的裝飾，和靑年們練習接吻的藝術。</p>
<p>如果「春天不是請書天」這句話是不錯的，那麽，正在靑春時代的靑年們沉醉在酒和女人的懷抱裏，也是當然的了。</p>
<p>孫總理說：『知之惟艱，行之匪艱』。可是「議而不决，决而不行」。事情終歸難以成功。</p>
<h3>綠珠故里</h3>
<p>— 義</p>
<p>廣西博白，一個離城三十多里的綠蘿村。這綠珠的故里，恐怕知道的人不多罷？那裏有明媚的山色，有圖案般美麗的田圃；旁有綠珠江，那走不靈的流水，朝朝暮暮發出嗚咽的歷史音調，誰想到是在訴說牠主人的不幸呢？</p>
<p>「日暮東風怨啼鳥，落花猶似墜樓人。」</p>
<p>「當年歌舞人何在？金谷國中空月明！」</p>
<p>談起綠珠，這些句子會不期湧上心來。伊的身世，委實太令人痛悼了！</p>
<p>女史中有謂：「綠珠，晋石崇之愛妾，孫秀求之，崇不許；秀矯詔收崇。綠珠自墜樓下而死……」但於伊的里籍，尙無明確的記載。這是什麼綠故呢？</p>
<p>綠珠姓梁，本田家女，據說伊村裏有古井，水甘美，汲食者生女多姣麗；後來這井呌綠珠井。綠珠在妙齡時代，給石崇用三斛明珠聘娶，藏諸金谷園。墜樓後，一縷幽魂向着渺遠的故鄕飛回，接着在鄉裏一堡顯靈，堡人建廟供奉：這堡呌綠珠堡。最初，廟裏只是一塊多角形的石頭，後才改塑衣身、民國十五、六年間，香火極盛。但不久跟着倒神之風，廟已全部燬去，祇留下殘磚敗礫。</p>
<p>還有綠珠的種種遺事，只消你走到那裏各村莊，仍隨時可以聽到，不過輾轉流傳，已被染上迷信的色彩。至綠珠井，因年代久遠，是湮沒了。</p>
<p>這些，博白縣誌，都有較詳的記載的。</p>
<h3>內河輪上速寫</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>我每次從上海回到鄉下，終是搭那一艘能容三四百乘客的內河小輪船。</p>
<p>在內河小輪上，我每次戚覺到，這是整個社會的縮形。也可以說：這是一幅縮小的社會圖。不信，請看下面的記述：</p>
<p>許多的趁客們，男的，女的，老的，少的都有，他們有的趁頭等艙，有的趁二等艙，儘有不少的男女旅客，被擠在空氣汚濁的一間狹小的三等艙裏的，這艙位等級的高下，不是象徵着社會上貧富階級的分界嗎？</p>
<p>復次，在你坐定了以後，小販們的呼賣聲，儘會使你不能够安定，他們的目的，自然希望你能够買一些兒東西，然而，當你問他交易的時侯，他們噱頭之大，往往使一般不常出門者上當。譬如賣橘子的，起先說二毛錢買六隻，你如果還他十二隻，甚而至於十四隻，他們也會慢慢地來遷就你，而成功交易的。這種虛偽的欺詐的事態的演出，不也是大可以表示出社會現象的縮形嗎？</p>
<p>其他如徽章階級之不買船票，不道德者的臥佔坐位，輪船茶房的勢利，鄕村婦女的被人欺侮等等，一幕一幕的怪劇，在輪船中逐一表現，這也不是社會現象的反映嗎？</p>
<p>因此，我總是覺得：內河小輪實在整個社會的縮形，當我每次趁着的時候，時常發生這樣的一個感想！</p>
<h3>和平的保障</h3>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回　夜話凄凉生涯原是萝履痕零亂風雨太欺八</p>
<p>賈多才笑道：你說到伺侯兩個字，有話我就不敢向下說了。不過你說女人是知道女人心事的，這個我是十分贊成。難得你是這樣的熱心、明天就煩你和我跑上兩趟了。說着，抱住了拳頭，拱了兩拱手。浣花微笑道：跑兩趟？要跑雨趟作什麽？就是跑一趟，我覺得力景就有餘。賈多才笑道：楊小姐自己相信有這種把握，那自然不會假。不過跑一趟的力量有餘，那自然只用跑半趟了。請問這半趟是怎樣的跑法呢？浣花笑道：賈老爺你可不能同我咬字眼。你要同我咬字眼，我是不行。我的意思，也不過是說一去準成就是了。說者，站到桌子邊來，用手摸摸茶壺，笑道：只管和賈老爺談話，燈也暗了，茶也凉了，讓我去呌茶房來，和你斟杯熱茶喝罷。賈多才笑道：我們談得很有味，我們接着往下談罷，要茶房跑來跑去作什麽？浣花也沒有跟着說什麽。只是靠住桌子站了微笑。停了一停，他就由懷裏掏出一隻粉境盒子來·打開了盒子蓋，便將粉撲子　着粉，向臉上抹擦着。賈多才笑道：咦！西安也有這樣東西？浣花笑道：沒有這些東西，要摩登的人，是怎樣的摩登得起來呢？賈多才道：這話不是那樣說，因爲有摩登的人物在西安，所以這摩登用品，就紛紛的向西安來了。浣花笑道：那末，你還以爲我是很摩登的了。說着，半回過頭來，啾了賈多才一笑。其實這個時候，那煤油燈的　是更覺的昏暗了。他究竟是笑是哭，那裏分得出來？（一七二）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>說也奇怪，太后雖然已是一個很老的老婦人了，可是伊的一雙眼睛，却還是非常的淸明銳利；伊在那籃色的一桿絲上看了一會，便回頭來，向着一個女孩子說道：</p>
<p>「錯了！這裏應該還有一種顏色咧！你自己來瞧，上面這一絞的顏色旣是這樣深，第二絞的顏色却又這樣淡，比起其餘的來，不是深淺得太不平均了！這中間必須有一絞比上面的一絞略淺，而比下面的一絞略深的顏色，否則是斷乎接不上的！顯然是你沒有十分留意，所以跳過了一種了！」</p>
<p>我大着胆子，走近去仔細一看，果然我也覺得那兩絞絲的顏色是相差得太遠了：中間非得另加一絞調和的顏色進去，便不能使這幾十絞藍色的絲，有平均的深淺。雖然那負責洗染這項藍絲的女孩子，已在宮內專心從事於這一項工作達數年之久，竟還不能想到伊所染的顏色，已有了過深過淺的弊病；可是待太后指明白之後，大家一看，便覺得那邊果然很淸楚地缺了一種顏色。連我這個對於製絲工作猶是十足門外漢的人，也立卽看出來了！讀者試想：在幾十種深深淺淺的藍顏色裏頭，太后只須略看一看，便知道在某某兩種顏色之間缺少了一種調和的顏色，這樣銳利的目光，豈不令人拜服！（二八三）</p>
<h3>兩種催眠曲</h3>
<p>— 馮家渭</p>
<p>催眠曲的種類似乎很多。普通我們常聽到的是：姊妹花。搖籃曲，催眠曲，新催眠曲等。其中我覺得姊妹花和催眠曲。可以代表兩個階級的母性。</p>
<p>雖則從無綫電或留聲機中同是一樣地放送，然而我們假如仔細傾聽一下，姊妹花昔調之慘，催眠曲情調的愉悅，我們的感受是絕對不同的。</p>
<p>假如再從字義上一看：姊妹花正如一個可慘的女人的啜泣。「孩子，你睡吧，你的媽沒錢給你買搖籃兒，只有用手來抱你，你的父親沒有錢給你買木馬，雖則木馬是這樣地好，然而只有父親裝了爬。」這是一個多悽慘的故事啊！而催眠曲呢？却正表現了資產階級的風度。孩子雖未入睡，而醒來吃的糕却早預備好了。</p>
<p>雖是絕不相同的故事，然而從無綫電或留聲機中，却同是茫然地鑽進住在大厦裏人們的耳鼓。</p>
<h3>鼠猴的烟癖</h3>
<p>— 寗自强</p>
<p>余供職曹府時，曾聞居停談猴鼠亦梁有烟癖，其事頗趣。居停之言日：　有染阿芙蓉癖者，每於吞雲吐霧時，其所蓄之猴，輒依依膝下不忍去，久之主人遠出，猴留在家，烟　火發，致不能自制，竟將主人之被褥牀帳，撕毀無遺，主人歸，知爲猴之惡作劇，重怒之下，遂將猴用棒擊死，事後思之，始悔前此之孟浪，然已不可及矣！</p>
<p>村中某甲每當抽烟時，一鼠每蹲踞其帳頂而不去，日日如此，鮮有間斷，某甲數見不鮮，絕不爲怪，一日某甲他遷，而鼠已斃於帳頂矣！</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>電波</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>電波有加减二種，加即Plus號爲十，减即Minus記號爲一，因其電流的方向，也可分爲直流與交流兩種，其在同一方向流的，謂之直流，如電池與蓄電池之類，如所流的方向交互的，謂之交流，我們家中所用的電燈，在一秒鐘間以五十次六十次輪流加减的。現在的無綫收音機，也有直流機與交流機，直流機就是用電池，交流機那用電燈綫了。然而（一）電波是什麼意思呢？譬如上面所說的交流，可稱爲振動電流，換句話說，好像在靜止的池中，投以石子，那就發生波紋了。電氣的波，也是同樣的，所以稱爲電波。電流在一秒間，有百萬次振動，電波就起了百萬，通常使用眞空管就可出電波。（二）然而波是什麼意思呢？大凡聲音在空中，一秒間，可以達到三百三十一米突的距離。電波所走的速度，非常奇怪，好像光一樣的，在一秒間，可走到三億米突的距離。那末，電在一秒間，如振動了百萬次，電波就有百萬，這百萬之數，把電波一秒間速度三億米突除去來，爲三百米突長，就是呌做時長。在報紙每天看見的播音的編號節目，如JOAK八七〇KC與JOB七五〇KC等，就是一秒間的波數，把三億米突除出來的數目。（三）長波與短波，不明白電波的人，聽到波長八七〇以爲就是八七〇米突，也有以長波比短波聽到爲快的，這是大錯了。所謂波的長短，與電波飛散的速度，沒有關係的，原來音與光，如被遮隔，就不能前進，而電波不論有木石鋼瓦等遮隔，也能通過的可是這樣奇怪的電波，碰到了金屬，那就在最後變爲原來的振動電流了。無綫電報無綫電收昔器，即利用這性質的，我們開收音機時，初時聽到的沙沙之聲，這就是電波來時的音。當無綫電台報告者發出了音，依其聲音的大小調子，遂飛出了複雜的電波，這波觸到我們所裝的天綫Antenna就換於振動交流，通眞空管而整流，（礦石亦可）更至增幅器而擴大連絡擴聲器Loud—Speaker發生原來的本普了。　說到發明電波者，是一八八八年德國人海雨支H．R．Hrets距今已有四十七年，籍這電波而發明無綫電報者，爲意大利的馬雨可尼。G．Maroconi，到了一九〇六年，（距今二十九年以前）美國人台富阿雷，再發明了眞空管，於是全世界的無綫電話車業，遂一日千里的進步了。</p>

<h3>替娘兒們寫的史</h3>
<p>— 大戈女士</p>
<p>中國的史書，不管是十七史十八史，廿一史廿四史，以至于一直到最近書店裏出版的廿五史廿六史。概括起來說：這些這些全都是男子們的歷史而已，與女子們是無大關係的。</p>
<p>因爲，史書裏所載的事實，大都是稱頌某某皇帝，讚揚某一些文臣武將，毀謗某個王者，汚蔑某一些武將文臣，說來說去，全是男子們的賬，老格式而已。</p>
<p>至于間或談到了女子，不是良母，便是賢妻。花木蘭明明是勇武，偏偏要說她是孝心；褒氏寡言笑，偏偏要說周幽王的江山，是她斷送的。</p>
<p>於是：女子只配洗衣煮飯抱小孩。成了定論，還能有什麽出息呢？</p>
<p>但是不行！掽着頂頭戶了！男子們所能的她都能，男子們御用的不合理的禮敎，她連理也不理的便一脚踢開；并且，連一晌男子們所包辦的皇位，她也要來嘗一嘗。</p>
<p>她是誰？武則天是也。</p>
<p>乍聽到武則天三個字，恐怕有不少人要把頭搖得和「搖鼓鼕」一樣吧？其實，仔細想想，是大可以慢慢搖的。</p>
<p>我們先來看看她的歷史罷。—手頭裏，沒有唐書，無從查她的詳細傳略。單只翻開了辭源，「止」字部，「武」字類，有關于她的一段叙述：（大概是根據唐書的）……</p>
<p>「唐高宗之后，名罌，許州人。初太宗選爲才女，太宗崩，削髮爲尼。高宗時復落髮入宮，旋立爲皇后。高宗苦疾，后决事，稱旨。高宗崩，臨朝稱制，廢中宗，改國號周，恣爲淫虐，嬖倖張易之張昌宗兄弟，任用酷吏來俊臣等。然富于權略，能用人，故名相輩出。晚年朝憲大亂，張柬之等乃因寢疾，迫禪位于中宗，后亦尋死。謐則天皇后。」</p>
<p>這短短的一小段，雖說很簡單，但我們至少已可明瞭三點：</p>
<p>（一）「……初太宗選爲才女……削髮爲尼……高宗時復蓄髮入宮……」這，我們曉得她是個從怎樣艱難困苦的環境中奮鬥出來的人物！牠後來的作爲，所以不平常，是完全在未做皇帝以前的遭際，就打好了辛辣的基礎。决不是偶然的事！</p>
<p>（二）「……后决事，稱旨，高宗崩，臨朝稱制，廢中宗，改國號周……富于權略，能用人，故名相輩出……」這，使我們進一步知道她是具有如何過人的統治才能，和敢作敢爲的魄力。我們曉得，她的歷史，能在男子的筆底寫出「富于權略能用人」的話來，决不是普通的了，而能輕易博得的。</p>
<p>（三）「……恣爲淫虐，嬖倖張易之張昌宗兄弟，任用酷吏來俊臣等……」這大概就是武則天千古的罪狀吧？這大概就是一般人聽到武則天三個字就搖頭的綠故吧？其實，平心而論，武則天在皇帝中，還要稱做個節慾主義者哩，尋常皇帝，公開地擁有三宮六院七十二妃，我們是常常聽見的；但並不曾有人說他們荒淫。爲什麽武則天嬖倖了張易之張昌宗，就要稱做恣爲淫虐？」這是什麼緣故呢？答曰……因爲她是個女子。至於任用酷吏一層，我找不出一個封建社會的皇帝是不殘酷的。不管那些史官們說得如何漂亮。</p>
<p>談到這裏，於是我便想起中國古代的著作者和現代一部分著作者的可惡。</p>
<p>本來，女子們不止于洗衣燒飯抱小孩的能力，他們是知道的。女子們和男子們所應共同遵守的禮法（？），大家是一樣，他們當然也是心裏明白的。</p>
<p>但，他們偏偏要那樣說。</p>
<p>爲什麼呢？我想或許是底下的兩個原因：</p>
<p>（一）男子們倚仗着傳統下來的封建勢力，一方面欺壓同性的男子；另一方面，就是欺壓異性的女子。因爲是異性的綠故，所以欺壓得格外利害，這便是普通所說的大虫吃小虫，毛虫吃芥虫的例子。無奈，芥虫也有狠的。武則天畢究做過皇帝，給他們天經地義的不平等條約，挖下一個大洞。自然，武則天太可惡了，於是給她加上淫虐無恥的罪名，結論的文章，便是……「看呀！我說如何，女子怎成呢？」</p>
<p>（二）著作者常常喜歡肉麻當有趣，不管女子做一件什麽事，往往要死拖活拉地牽連到性愛等等問題方面去。男子們下意識中的傳統成見不剷除，他們對於娘兒們的觀點，不會改善的。</p>
<h3>成了神仙</h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>—大行追記—</p>
<p>我不會騎過馬，對於「馬性一是不大瞭解的。現在「饒光」得很，一匹馬立在暮色蒼茫的道上，只等我騎上去。它不停的擺耳蹬蹄，想是已竟餓的發慌。然而要騎上去，便覺得欠一點勇氣，—就說是「欠一點」罷。雖然不曉得馬上威風」，但關於馬的傳說是知道一點的。我生長的地方有一句話，道是：「一馬三分龍。」馬似乎又有幾分神性了。但說只有「三分」，可見並不就是龍。我旣不憎馬也不敬馬。</p>
<p>據說馬的脾氣很大，性子很暴烈的。望望山，也頗有幾分神秘氣味，要走上去的一面，正背陽光，顯得非常　　，上到尖頂約有五六里路的樣子，倘一個不留神，豈不「翻身落馬一，且要落山，將眞成爲肉泥血漿了。所以作起「一鞭殘照裏」的詩句並不難，難的倒是騎上去，又如何來那麽一鞭。何况從沒有騎過馬的呢。這時我憑空想起不如閱兵了，那定然有一名「馬童將馬帶牢，絕不聽其發脾氣的：我在畫報上看見過。</p>
<p>來接的朋友同隨從都已齊楚，在馬上揚鞭催促了，不便再磨延，即聳身跨上鞍轎。還好，它並不會如我料想的那般凶刁，當人將騎與未騎穩之際猛的向前一撞。我一面暗自感謝馬，一面感謝主人。</p>
<p>「這馬幾時也淸高起來了！」我說。</p>
<p>馬擺了擺頭，很斯文，又像對我抗議。</p>
<p>人馬一直升上去，是一重旣危險又快意的奇觀。路拆轉而上，兼之剛下過雨，脚下那些被磨得禿光禿光的石塊異常滑溜，馬像滑冰似的一面打着滑跌，爲防備一失足落向谷裏，一面還得跳着狐步舞。蹄聲咵咵響着，其偉壯是只有一馬賽進軍曲」可以比擬的罷。</p>
<p>晚霞發出彩絹的光，一縷一縷斜橫在頭頂。人同馬打着滑跌，跳着舞，踏着進軍曲漸漸接近彩霞，似乎馬一躍身，就可以躦將進去。回望山下，谿谷間騰起一茫濃霧，此身飄飄然，一如在雲端裏，當眞要忘却「世俗」了！騎馬登山竟是這樣充滿了詩意的，我不會知道。</p>
<p>但是，這詩也不能一直做下去，當將要一脚踏進霄漢時，馬停下來了。它知道雲端不能馳聘；竟又是這樣不通人意，嗚呼！</p>
<p>在這短短的行程中，我知道馬不與驢同。倘是驢（簡直是流氓，不僅刁頓，而且愚蠢），要决意怠工下來，就一個乾脆將人摔下脊背，算是給責打者的一點懲罰。而馬不然：比馿聰明，它懂得責打是爲着要它前進，並非逼它投崖自盡，所以任怎樣處罰，它只是給一個不理。它很斯文的站着，在鞭下還觀賞山景，大一可以充吾師」的。不得已只好請它上去。來在山頂，已竟昏黑了</p>
<p>一顆星像水銀珠，在西南方光亮的閃灼着。四山絕了飛烏。最遠處，一座崇　後面，尙殘留着稀微的白光，照耀着積雪的山頂。谷上彌漫着霧，有黑影在搖動，大約是樹叢。下面送來吠聲，山景益見荒凉。風吹得馬的鬃　翻轉來，尾巴順風飄擺，一縷一縷要脫開去的樣子。經年的枯草瑟瑟如慄。馬四蹄打顫，迷茫的向還處望着，悲抑的搖搖頭，又繼續　食枯草。問了同行者，說是尙有十五里的山要爬。</p>
<p>現在回想，題目應作「荒山乘馬圖」，自己便做做「圖」中主脚。充充「風　三俠」中人物，在時下定會被歡迎的罷！</p>
<h3>曲拾（一）（續）</h3>
<p>— 沃圃</p>
<p>（三）天淡雲閒</p>
<p>洪防思長生殿第二十四　驚變，首曲北中呂粉蝶兒！</p>
<p>「天淡雲閒，列長空數行新雁。御園中秋色爛斑；柳添黃，蘋减綠，紅蓮脫瓣。一抹雕蘭，　淸香桂花初綻。」</p>
<p>至今傅播歌塲，膾炙人口。然洪氏此曲，實有紹襲並非創作。雍熙樂府卷六中呂粉蝶兒楊妃舞翠盤套云：</p>
<p>「天淡雲閒，寫長空數行征　。御園中夏景初殘；菊添黃，荷减綠，秋蓮脫瓣。坐近雕欄，却原來噴淸香玉簪初綻。」</p>
<p>此曲當係出於王伯成天竇遺事諸宮調。與驚變折曲文互校，計：二句「列」原作「寫」「新」原作「征」，三句「秋色爛斑」原作「夏景初殘」，四句「柳」原作「菊」，五句「蘋」原作「荷」，六句「紅原作「秋」，七句「一抹」原作「坐近」，七句原多「却原來」三襯字，又「桂死」原作「玉簪一，共僅十六字之添換，此外完全相同。彷彿是一種曲文板本上的訛異，不像是兩個人各自的作品。自來以詩詞舊文入曲，恒見之事，惟或引用斷篇零句，不則　括大意；全劇改作或潤飾，那又當別論。眼前的例子，如王實甫的運用董西廂中若干文字，我們却不甚感到牠有襲用的意味。同一是受着「諸宮調」的影響，像這樣全支劇竊，是誠裨畦賢者之過了。不過更易處，可說是靑出於藍；原文「菊添黃」，時序似乎不近初秋，不如「蘋字」吻合，「荷」「蓮」連用，亦嫌重複。獨「列」字比較起來，還仍應以原作「寫」宇佳勝一點。</p>
<p>這楊妃舞翠盤套曲，在鄭氏宋金元諸宮調考一交中，論及天寳　事諸宮調輯逸一部分時，失收，不知何故？鄭氏以遺漏「曉日荔枝香」及「霓裳舞」二事的王伯成曲文爲悵，在舞翠盤套裏，恰可彌補這缺憾。</p>
<p>『「迎仙客」香馥馥的味正酣，嬌滴滴色初妍，恰便似九重天摘將來。摘將來到人世間，取時難，得後罕。可惜不生長在長安，因此上敎驊使把紅塵販。</p>
<p>『「紅綉鞋」則不向金盤中托獻，也　將翠袖擎看。端的是綘紗　罩水晶寒，爲甚不生在北地，怠生長在南　？這正是物稀人見罕。』</p>
<p>這不是「曉日荔枝香」麽？此下快活三，鮑老兒古鮑老，紅莤藥諸曲，實寫舞　盤事，有「比着那月殿裏的霓裳按」語。更說到「鄭觀昔琵琶」「賢王玉笛」「花奴羯鼓」「寗王錦箏」」梅妃玉簫」「黃番綽拈板」等情事，具體的有些像「霓裳羽衣。」雖說「舞盤」或原是另一事，而「霓裳」的塲面，在王氏這本「諸宮調」裏，也應該有更博大繁褥的抒寫。但天寳遺事引哨遍麥，有「巧稱雕盤按霓裳」的話，不能說沒有關係。</p>
<p>然而當這歡樂的極峯，從剔銀燈以下各曲，便忽地換了境界：</p>
<p>「剔銀燈」我則聽的報說道天昏至晚，你素取箇遲疾緊慢；等不的筵上笙歌散，走將來氣呸呸冒凟尊顏。過來說！齊管仲，鄭子產，假忠孝龍逢，比干。「蔓靑菜」險些兒慌殺一個周公且，他道是：因歌舞，戀吹彈。你常好是占奸！早難羽扇綸中笑談間，破强虜三十萬？</p>
<p>「啄木兒」尾聲一端詳了上馬嬌，怎支吾蜀道難？嵯峨峻嶺連雲棧，從來不慣，幾程兒　撤雁門關。」</p>
<p>這個局勢，顯見的也是一個「驚變」，曲文中不很明白地有楊國忠在着麽？歌舞未終，倉皇入告，長生殿本齣，連排塲關目，都老實的沿用着舞翠盤這一套。尾聲：</p>
<p>「在深宮元自嬌慵慣，怎樣支吾蜀道難？妃子呵！愁殺你玉軟花柔怎將途路鑽！」</p>
<p>却又是啄木兒尾聲的原意。照此看來，洪氏當日似實曾見過且利用過土氏原作的，長生殿中別的地方，恐怕也未能免此。</p>

<h3>巨卿先生（五）</h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>這意外的打搫給巨卿先生的眼前蒙了一塊黑紗，望着前途，更顯得一片的黯淡和渺茫。</p>
<p>第二天就要開書房了，幾天活動的結果沒一點眉目，巨卿先生急得有點走投無路的樣子。橫在他心頭的，除了生活的恐慌，還混和了一種不可解說的虛榮心理；學生太少時對於他的名舉上也是損失。爲了彌補這缺憾，他願意招收幾個不收學費的學生。那天他借故跑到貼鄰皮匠運生的家裹，很同情地對那駝了背的皮匠說：</p>
<p>「連生老倌，你們阿狗—今年九歲不是？—應該上學了。俗語說「一字値千金」，小孩子讀誓是要緊的，那個爹娘不巴望兒子早出山？我曉得你們苦，我不收你們的「書錢」。</p>
<p>皮匠運生仰起他駝了的身軀，感激得說話也有點「連刀塊」，他說得細聲細氣地：</p>
<p>「先生，你真是，眞是—，我們老小都見情。小孩子有書讀，那真是—，還有什麽話頭，讀書是，「一字値千金』。」說到這裏，眉毛漸漸打了結，話在他嘴裏像衝不出來似的：「不過，不過，家裏祇有我跟阿狗娘兩個，一天到晚生活忙不過來；阿狗在家裏要燒飯，還要，還要，兩個小的也要他領，實在走不開。你先生眞是——眞——</p>
<p>下面想說幾句感謝的話，不知道要怎麼說，最後舒了一口氣：「唉！」</p>
<p>巨卿先生惘惘然地跑回家，心裏空虛得渾身找不着邊際；腦袋卻賬得像要被這空虛擠破；而且這世界也像悶得要崩潰了。</p>
<p>開學那一天的大淸早晨，倒出乎意外地臨時來了一個新「開筆」的學生，事前也沒個通知，祇由那裔人模樣的父親伴送着，對先生謙恭客氣地說了幾句『小孩子不懂事，全仗先生嚴緊管敎，儘管打』一類的話，便拱拱手，留下孩子，忽忽忙忙告了辭。——把小孩子開筆的事情看得這樣隨便，臨渴掘井，也不拜師，也不報名；要是在前三四年，巨卿先生是一定拒絕收受了的，但目前情形已形不同，他祗深切地感到：這世界眞是變了。</p>
<p>拜過孔夫子，瞧着學生零零落落地散了：那麽冷落，那麽衰敗！去年還不止這些哩。今年算加了一個新生，但舊學生却還少五六個。事實竟落在自己預想的不幸當中了，了解了焦急的無用，於是祇好用各種方法寬慰着自己。——</p>
<p>也許過幾天會來的？</p>
<p>可是，七八天匆匆過去，缺課的學生一個也不見來，祗從已經來了的學生的口裏，聽到了斷斷續續的消息：朱張森家裏太窮，在鄉下過不了日子，跟他母親八太娘到上海去了。陳志淸的父親在去年年底失了業，回了家鄉，家裏吃餐餓頓的，鬧得鷄犬不寗，恐怕今年不見得再上學。胡春林，聽說轉進了太史第南先生的私塾，是被南先生拉了去的……對於他們，巨卿先生不得不宣布絕望了。</p>
<p>現在巨鄕先生只惦記着一個人：張寡婦的獨餋子，全書房成續最好的學生張文燦。爲了母親管束的嚴厲，孩子本身也特別良善一點，往年張文燦輕易從不請半天假；爲了母親對於孩子屬望的殷切，曾懇切地對先生說過：「阿燦多虧先生敎得好，我們張家就祇他這一點香烟，我要喝口盬醋培植他，讓他跟先生好好　幾年。」道十拿九穩的得意弟子，至今也還沒看到他的踪跡。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>紐約取締離婚案</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>平常我們會見花旗牌博士碩士之流，在敬　他說新大陸如何繁盛發達文明　　之餘，每每還半分光榮半分眩耀的侃述及「黃金國」的人民生活，是如何的自由，又怎樣的平等，說得一般蛙步不能出國門的人，飄然神往，心響往之。如像說那兒的男女是怎樣的平權，歸女又是何等的斛放，實例極多，如公共場所電車上男子讓位，進出男子國門，公園散步男人替女子提皮包拿大衣，屋裏替女人跋高跟鞋種種「尊重女權的表現，均使素來就「尊男卑女」的我們，自歎不如。慚愧無地。</p>
<p>是的，盎格魯，薩克遜人對婦女很客氣，開口一聲「馬丹］，閉口一聲「密司」，處處表現着一種婦女「高等僕歐」的廉恭；帶上黑禮帽，白手套，一步一趨，一言︸禮，極盡「尖頭曼」的能事。這種禮貌，也隨「歐化」之倡導而盛行於我國的高等華人。可是這就是所謂尊重女權，男女平等麽？我不僅認為是北轍南轅，而且係屬於砒霜丸上加糖包皮之類。謂予不信，請看事實：</p>
<p>路透社紐約電，謂「紐約州長李曼近簽定取締州內離棄案。男子如愛情破裂，而欲自由，則所謂未婚妻者，不能要求金錢以作愛情的代價；如果有此情事，則可控該女子欺詐，而受罰金一千元至五千元，或監禁一年至十年的處分。即女子不得以愛情不專，或始亂終棄之罪控告男子，要索金錢上的賠償。」李曼之所以　　，因常有人假離棄為敲詐之工具，據其統計，紐約男子受此美人騙局之敲詐　　出資已不下一千萬，此案一行，則將不復有男子被控離棄或誘姦之事云。</p>
<p>當然，所謂使紐約男子損失一千萬的離棄誘姦案，就產生於男士們帶起「白手套」後，對婦女「慇懃誠懇」「蜜意濃情」的一禮貌」之中，這後面，站着玩弄女性之金錢勢力。這一點，絕未因美國婦女的「解放」與「男女平權」就有多少的變更，紐約始亂終棄的離棄與誘姦案件之多，便為例證。</p>
<p>這種女子受揶揄侮弄的事件，在以前還可訴之法庭，雖然得了金錢賠償並不算是勝利，究竟還可使左擁右抱者流有所顧忌。但是現在不行，控男子離棄誘姦是成了敲詐，要受罰，要監禁；即是說女子被男子誘姦離業是正理，應該，若要控告，反而要「陪了夫人又折兵」！</p>
<p>這是黃金國的男女平等，我國之有「寡人之疾」的人，大可借鏡。</p>
<h3>村居所見</h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>清早上，老人挑擔子走到近城的地方，便給營門的小兵拉進去，拉去幹嗎，有人說是當兵子，亦有人說是軍隊要開拔拉去充行李。不管是哪一件，總歸是再倒霉沒有的了。</p>
<p>這個消息立刻傳遍左鄰右舍每個人的耳鼓里，於是大家集攏在一塊，臉上各處飛滿了懼怕的色彩，在紛紛談說着。在那當中就有女人的發沙的嗓子嘆息起來——</p>
<p>「唉，整整去了一年了，無音無信，誰敢說死了還是活着，這年頭，那些殺千刀的！—現在，又來了！現在，唉！」</p>
<p>大家的視綫都都聚到那女人的臉部，一同地帛着氣。帶着回憶的慘痛而嗚咽說着的那女人是大生嫂。她的聲調是嘶哽的，差點哭了出來。</p>
<p>想起那向的事就彷彿呌錘子撞着真痛上心窩哩！前年大生也同這回老大一樣從天降了禍，給小兵擒住胳膊，兩手背剪綑着，像促一個囚犯者似的帶去營門里去，大生心里明白有去就沒有來，生命是要緊的，因此哀求着，掙扎着，甚至雙膝跪了下去，懇求兵老爺饒了他，家里有妻子和兒子，在等着他養活的。兵老爺自然顧不到這些。大生嫂跟在他們屁股後，一路走一路，呌天呌地頭髮亂做一堆挨了過去發瘋以也，兵老爺乃沒動心迎頭重重地朝大生嫂的肚子那兒踢了一腿，大生嫂應聲栽倒在路旁，以後的事她小知道了：……</p>
<p>想到這里，大牛嫂便眼眶濕潤潤的，無形的淚顆在她的眼珠里溜。怎麽不悲痛，尤其是她肚子那兒還留着一大塊創疤里。</p>
<p>「天呀，我的大生給誰害的，那些殺千刀的……」</p>
<p>又那麽咬着牙根自語似的咒着。</p>
<p>女人們聽了這消息各自拐回家，急急的警告自己的男人：</p>
<p>—老八給抓去了，又是那回事，你知道不，今天可別出門囉！當心點。</p>
<p>—可不是，今天得吃風了，你趕緊去跟人家借二升米來吧，男人蹙着眉回答，可憐他們這些人家子，都是靠男人雙硬朗腿子，和一身力氣，天一亮便溜出去東西南北竄，給人們挑担子進城，討一天過一天的那麽度日子的。一有三長四短，或是病着，老小準得癟肚皮。但是最使人害怕的却莫過這回事。</p>
<p>別的不去說，只就大生的例子便够給他們一個深刻不忘的印象，想着誰也會不禁發冷抖，於是男人們祇好躱在屋子里納悶，半天不敢跨出門。一跨出門馬上有被抓去的危險，男人變成女人在守家了。</p>
<p>買東西出街都讓女人去辦。</p>
<p>街面上頓然形出非常冷靜來了，全瞧不見平時那些一面掮着重担子，一面流汗的壯漢子，只有幾個女人在跑着，而最惹人注目的和呌人一碰着如碰着鬼一樣的就是也許三個一夥，也許五個一夥，有的托槍桿子，有的拿着一串繩子的小兵老爺，射着兇惡的眼光，雄糾糾在街頭街尾來往沖撞着，　喝着。偶然之間在遠遠的地方有個男子的影子給他們瞥見，就一夥兒飛亦以的追了上去，一邊追，一邊叱咤着「別走，別走，」有時候說不定「砰」的一聲朝天上開了嚮槍對前面在沒命奔逃着的人加以恐嚇。那樣騷亂了一天半天倒算是幸事的，如果再繼續下去，生命雖保存着，但光是餓也餓個一乾二凈了。</p>
<h3>浪</h3>
<p>— 不揚</p>
<p>我怕浪。</p>
<p>脆弱的生命是再禁不起這樣顛簸的。</p>
<p>可是我逃不過浪的掌握。</p>
<p>每次鼓着勇氣出來和斂着倦乏的翼子回去，我總惴惴地擔心着，會不會把吃下去的東西從原路上摸出來。</p>
<p>故鄉和S埠是間隔着一望無涯的海面呀！那裏是浪的世界。</p>
<p>我得在它的世界裏做一夜的俘虜。</p>
<p>為着預防起見，不敢吃酒；就是飯也少吃了一碗。夕陽時的海面是誧滿着金沙的，燦爛，宏偉，有許多詩人讚嘆過，也有人給誘惑過，可是我沒福領受，我怕浪。</p>
<p>死挺挺的僵臥在硬的木板上，不敢和別人多接談，眨着眼，束手無策地等候浪的光臨。</p>
<p>內江的浪，不，應該說是微波吧。和蕩婦的打情罵俏一樣，怪輕鬆地　不着什麽。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>一出口就不同了，像巨靈擺動着鐵扇似的，整千噸的船就和吃醉了酒一樣，鎗鎗踉踉地進行着。</p>
<p>在蹌蹌踉踉裏我的頭開始覺着異樣。</p>
<p>引擎聲和浪聲隔着一層鐵板搏鬥着，杯和杯在桌子上相打，身體像元寶似的：頭沉下去，脚蹺起來，脚沉下去，頭蹺起表，胃裏的存貨就一步一步地往喉嚨裏送。</p>
<p>——今夜的浪很大。</p>
<p>茶房說着，把杯子收進抽屜裏，再把掛着的東西拿下。</p>
<p>下死勁地迸住喉朧，呼吸只得讓它在鼻孔裏作單程交通。</p>
<p>就在這種極度的忍受下，我到了彼岸。可是我得慶幸：沒有把吃下去的東西從原路上摸出來。</p>
<p>這也許使浪失望的吧？不過它的威權不能侵佔到陸上是事實。</p>
<p>我更怕現實的巨浪。</p>
<p>它是捏有厚大實力的魔王，它的威權是不分水陸的，它會活生生地把一個人從原路上摸回去。</p>
<p>忍受嗎？那無盡期的畏縮是不可能的抵抗嗎？失了舵的小船是不能和整　噸的巨輪對比的。於是只得抱緊了槳載沉藏浮地隨着它飄流着，飄流着。倘然一個不慎的話，就有滅頂危險的：像最近哥哥的失業是一個鐵證。當然，失業的並不祇哥哥一人。</p>
<p>從那裏感覺到的不是頭暈，是整個心靈的顫抖，不是嘔吐，是飢餓的進逼。不是杯和杯的相扜，是齒和齒的交戰？不是船去破浪，是浪來撲船。一夜的顛簸是好過的，一生的飄泊却難挨。</p>
<p>不安定的生活，不健全的環境，於是永遠給浪捉弄着。</p>
<p>每次，我總擔心給浪撲滅了一切，可是放不下別人，我不甘悄悄地從原路摸回去。同時，為着別人，我得忍氣地茍活着，無盡地，過着浪裏的生活。</p>
<h3>煆煉</h3>
<h3>乞丐</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>小飯店裏的電燈光是顯得格外的暗淡。店夥們忙忙碌碌地把炒熟的菜蔬從廚房裏向桌上送。雪白的飯一碗碗地從飯桶裏送到人們的肚中。</p>
<p>門外是一條柏油路，幾個行人在彳亍着。路的那邊是一條鐵路，一列從江灣開來的火車剛經過那兒，發出尖銳的汽笛聲。</p>
<p>一個乞丐走到了小飯店的門前，靠在牆上向店裏窺視，默默地，默默地。</p>
<p>也許菜和飯的香味引起那乞丐的飢飽吧！一定的，他是忍受不了他心中的苦痛了，於是他開始向那在忙着送菜的夥計求乞。</p>
<p>「啊．啊啊啊，啊——」乞丐是個啞子呢！張開了喉矓直嘶着。</p>
<p>吃飯的仍舊在吃飯，送菜的依舊在送菜，誰都沒注意着他。</p>
<p>「啊，啊——啊！」聲音更響了！他把手指了指嘴，又指一指肚子，於是伸開了手：「啊，啊，啊啊——」</p>
<p>「走開！沒有的！」一個夥計向他罵着。</p>
<p>「啊，啊——」乞丐並沒移動他的身體。是的，他是想得到人的同情的，他是想人給他憐憫的。他以為罵是很平常的事。</p>
<p>「啊——」</p>
<p>夥計有些不耐煩了。</p>
<p>「滾開！」砰的一聲，門閉上了。</p>
<p>乞丐的臉從玻璃的外面露出來。依舊在呌着。</p>
<p>許多人的肚子都裝滿了，快樂地走出去送菜的依舊在忙碌着。</p>
<p>終於乞丐的影子消失在黑暗中了。</p>
<p>啞子是可憐的。</p>
<h3>小職員</h3>
<p>— 本高</p>
<p>窗上剛有一絲乳白色，李英就起了床，他睜大了惺忪的倦眼，向那簡陋的臥室無力地掃了一週，他看見龍鐘的老母，正在夢中一聲聲的呻吟着；而　還夾雜得有使人刺耳的喀聲。她的病是很利害的。他覺得她需要一個人不時的在旁侍奉，可是他自己不工作一天，生活就更會發生問題的。何况今天的寫件是特別的多，昨晚他回家時王主任還說：『李英，明天你該早些來，有着許多的文件要你寫呢』。又使他不得不想暫時忍心離別病臥的母親。於是他披上一件油光光的夾衣，依依地出了家門。</p>
<p>在路上。他想起了辦公處的陰森，和上級先生們的板得像法官審問犯人時一樣鐵青的臉，使他不自覺的心中起了絕大的空虛。而且辦公處的無論大小的先生，對他彷彿都含着一種藐視的態度；甚至供人使喚的茶役，也只奉承着挺腰凸肚口啣雪茹滿臉是官氣的先生，見了他總會頭也不抬的自顧溜過一邊的。只多也不過含合糊糊的招呼一聲。所以他在回家或出門時，在路上他常常躭心會碰見他們，縱然偶然遇到了，他也總是低了頭，不願讓自己看清他們。他怕傲岸的神情，和不自然的招呼。有些時，他便會固執的『脫離！我决意脫離這勢利逼人的所在。寗可餓死在家』！然而一想到生活及老母的病，便消夫了勇氣</p>
<p>進辦公處，時間還只七點。人是一個沒有。他小心翼翼的伏在一張小書桌上謄寫着文件的時候，又想着病了的母親，應該請個醫生來給診治　　。但每月十五元的薪水，簡直支配不過來。天冷了，自己身上　穿　夾的。那有錢請那動輒數元的醫生來，只是母親的病，一天一天的加重，總不能眼睜睜地看她死。他覺得只有再忍着羞，向王主任哀求預支下月份的薪金。</p>
<p>王主任還沒有來。鐘已打十一點。各部的職員却已先後來到，靜情情的辦公廳便登時充滿了談話聲，笑聲，以及濃烈的烟香。他門的有說有笑，更顯得他格外孤單得可憐。他不敢隨意的喀一聲嗽，怕會擾亂了他們的談鋒而受到極難看的嘴臉的。</p>
<p>王主任來了。大搖大擺的踱進辦公處，向四週瞥了一眼。這雖然是王主任的習慣。然而今日那炯炯的目光，着在李英身上，就使他感到坐立不安，彷彿已被窺透了他的內心：甚且同事們在竊竊私語時偶然望了他一眼，也會疑心到在講自己。但是他警告他自己說：『你太懦弱了！這有什麽怕，縱然他不借，也得開口』。於是他才决定去試試。</p>
<p>母親的病是給看過的了。然而李英却又躭憂着下月的開支。</p>

<h3>獲得一九三四年度電影藝術學院褒獎的六大明星（上）</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>（一）事前的醞釀</p>
<p>一九三五年開始而後，在好萊塢，立刻便在注意世界電影藝術科學研究院評選一九三四年度應予褒獎的電影明星了。因此，那個時候，我們在好萊塢的街頭尾巷，便到處可聽見有人談論這一個或那一個明星應得褒獎，和某幾個導演，他們的出品應得列入的，因為二月二十七日便要決定獲獎的名單了。</p>
<p>凱絲玲赫本是女星之中上一個年度的獲獎者，為了她所主演的The　Little　Minister一片，齊巧於規定時期內在洛杉磯公映，所以事前人們猜測她又有獲獎的希望了，至於她在去年早期的作品「柔腸烈性」Spitfiro一片，倒是缺少獲獎的可能。</p>
<p>卻爾斯勞登一九三三年度男演員中最好的一個，為「閨怨」The　Batretts　of　Wimpole　Street的演出，有相當的成績，又有再度獲獎的呼聲。</p>
<p>黛娜溫嫣，梅勞勃遜，上年並和凱絲玲赫本一樣的煊赫而獲選的，本年度也有相當的熱望。而男星中，卻和爾斯勞登競爭的，便是李思廉霍華，因為主演「孽債」Our　Fluman　Bondage一片，有很好的成績，同時，保羅茂尼和別的明星一樣，都以為沒有列入前茅之望。</p>
<p>在女星之中，可以獲得褒獎的，蓓蒂黛維絲以主演「孽債」，安娜史丹主演「復活」We　Live　Again克勞黛考爾白主演Tmitation　of　Life，葛萊絲摩亞主演「歌后情痴」One　Night　of　Love，都是有著濃厚的希望。</p>
<p>除了上面的幾個以外，安哈婷，漢侖海絲，以及另外幾個，也有獲選之望，而洛麗泰楊以「看護情史」The　White　Parade一片，也可獲得榮譽。</p>
<p>男星之中，事前的預測，大致卻勞斯勞登以「閨怨」，華雷斯皮萊以「自由萬歲」Viva　Villa，喬治亞理斯以「大富之家」The　House　of　Rothschild，克勞特雷斯以「戰地離魂」Man　Who　Reclaimed　His　Aead　和惠爾羅吉以David　Harum和Judge　Pirest兩片，都有獲獎的希望。</p>
<p>此外勞勃杜奈以「基督山恩仇記」The　Count　of　Monte　Cristo而不無相當希望，兼特立馬區的榮譽作很多，除了「藝海春光」Design　for　Livng和「復活」以外，「閨怨」也有使他獲獎的可能。</p>
<p>在過往一年之中，關於電影演員的藝術評選問題，為了電影檢查的緣故，更有一件很有趣的事情，便是李思廉霍華和蓓蒂黛維絲所主演的「孽債」，教會方面，都視為不清潔的影片。向來研究院評選方法，本以出品和表演的值價為標準，其他問題，什麼都不顧的，但這個年頭，關於這方面也不能不顧到呢！</p>

<h3>評「珍珠島下集」</h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>Pirate　Treasure</p>
<p>比較地說，這「珍珠島」Pirate　Treasure的下集，是比上集稍勝一籌的。我想，如果劇作者對於全劇冗長而非必要的故事，能夠加以剪裁；再把主角李查塔　打出手的演出，割愛一些應該割去的部分的話，那末，這二十多本的上下兩集，竟可以技術地組織成一次映完的劇本，這樣，望一般的武俠與探險的影片中間，這「珍珠島下集」也許可以站立較高的地位吧。</p>
<p>所謂這下集比較上集好者，乃是指導演手法方面，比較進步，不像上集那樣的平鋪直敘，多少還有點戲可看。自然，在這以顯耀武技為能事的片子中，所謂有戲，也是很有限的。這裏如在出發的過程中，海船上發現了壞律師勃萊斯等一羣惡黨潛伏在艙板底下的時候，雙方的格鬥，以及到達了目的地後，爭奪寶藏的往來廝殺等，依然是重複與多餘的。</p>
<p>有一點，說來倒頗為嚴重的，在狄克他們利用了土人，特別是酋長的力量，制服了敵方勃萊斯等這一羣，而獲得了盈箱滿篋的珍珠之後，居然會從土人手中去救回勃萊斯他們來。這呌觀眾體味著什麼呢？是劇作者在表現狄克和船主等的偉大仁慈嗎？不！在小的財寶方面的矛盾上，他和惡人勃萊斯是仇敵；在這小矛盾既經解決之後，把問題面到土人這有色人種方面的當兒，他們畢竟是無色的White人了呀！「財寶，美人，權威」！這權威自然要表現給有色人種，才特別顯著夠味兒的。</p>
<p>末了，還得指出這片中的某些場面如土人歌舞等，是從別的片子中剪過來的，而且由於沒有選擇，還不免顯著可笑的痕跡哩！</p>
<h3>題材恐慌中文藝電影的勃興</h3>
<p>— 過程</p>
<p>年來將文學作品搬上銀幕而製成影片的風氣，在好萊塢非常盛行，最近數月間在本埠開映的這類影片，光是最能賣座的片子，至少就能數出兩打，如迭更斯（Charles　Dickens）的「獄底餘生」（原名Great　Ekpectotion），史蒂芬遜（R,L,Stevenson）的「金銀島」（原名T`reasure　Island），麥加亞倫的「斷釵記」，馬漢的「孽債」，以及「閨怨」，「唐吉訶德先生」，「小婦人」，「娜娜」，「基督山恩仇記」，「相逢恨晚」，「復活」等。尤以托爾斯泰的「復活」，甚至攝制的次數竟在三四次以上了。因此我們可以知道製片商們是怎樣地在文學的領域裏掘發著，而靠著那些受人讚譽的大著家的聲名，和他的不朽作品的深印人心，拿來找尋觀眾。</p>
<p>這實在是證明了他們（製片商）在題材方面已經感到了如何恐慌，而同時他們也明白了以前的那一類濫俗的偵探武俠歌舞的影片已不能再抓住觀眾的興味，因了這樣的緣故才出於此途。</p>
<p>然而我們知道，好萊塢影片的作風假使就能夠從此漸漸走往這一種方向上來，這確不能不說是一種好現象，無論如何是比那類偵探武俠歌舞的製片方針強得多了。</p>
<p>據最近消息，將在本埠谷氨酸映的影片，就有兩部是很值得推薦給觀眾的文學作品。一部是芬尼何斯脫（Fannie　Hurst）著的「春風秋雨」（Imitation　of　Lifeo）這是很嚴重的討論著「黑白人種」和「母愛」等問題的影片。一部是喬治苦克（George　Cnkor）導演的「塊肉餘生」（Divd　Copperfield），這是英國浪漫小說作者迭更斯的一部很悽慘的名著，（「塊肉餘生」在多年前，中國已有商務出版的林琴南的譯本），他的作品被搬上銀幕，這已不是第一次了。</p>
<h3>金城重映「漁光曲」</h3>
<p>「逃亡」改日仍將繼映</p>
<p>本埠各戲院及各製片公司，特於星期日上午十時，假座北京路金城大戲院，開會歡迎出席蘇俄國際電影展覽會我國代表陶伯君，席間陶君報告展覽會經過及蘇俄電影戲院事業情形甚詳，該院已於日前起，將在電展會獲得榮譽獎之「漁光曲」，重映數天同時並加映阮玲玉女士哀榮錄兩本。至於在該院開映之「逃亡」一片，亦屬藝華公司最榮譽出品。公映以來，頗受社會歡迎，賣座方面，昨日仍告客滿。故該院特向藝華公司情商，俟「漁光曲」映畢後，仍擬將「逃亡」一片繼續開映云。</p>
<h3>為「塊肉餘生」先容</h3>
<p>— 雲水</p>
<p>關於英大文豪，卻爾斯迭更司氏的著作，尤以「雙城記」與「塊肉餘生」，在吾國有極大的認識。前者是全以描寫法國革命為主幹的歷史小說，而「塊肉餘生」不啻是迭氏為自己作傳。所以當那部作品，開宗明義，即道作者自云，天下父母心中各有其至可愛可痛之寵兒；餘之寵兒，即大衛考麥斐爾云云。同時這部作品在文學上地位以及它的演情，特殊的作風種種同，本刊上早有不少介紹了。現在偉作已到滬，日內將在南京大劇院出映云。</p>
<h3>新時代公司近聞</h3>
<p>— 季翁</p>
<p>新時代公司經理葉淺予導演湯傑，於前晚連袂離滬，葉赴北平，湯往南京，分道觀察繼「王先生過年」後之新片外景云。</p>
<p>新時代公司之處女作「王先生的秘密」，自在金城大戲院映過後，久未出現。近聞不日即將在中央大戲院再與觀眾相見云。</p>
<p>「王先生過年」為新時代公司更進一步之作品，該片滑稽噱頭，勝於勞萊哈台，其中王先生騰雲一場，為中國電影史上所未覩，雲霧之技巧，開係該片青年攝影師陳晨絞盡腦汁研究所得。（卻）</p>

<h3>生之哀歌（三）</h3>
<p>— 培元</p>
<p>過了很慢地的幾天以後的下午，喬傑臉上仍帶著憂色的回來，他跑了十多個地方都沒有辦法。然而夢鷗卻找到了一個位置，是江海大學的立體幾何教授，不過夢鷗對於立體幾何素少研究，所以他雖謀到了這一個位置，卻有點惶悚，於是只有在要去上課的前幾天加緊的練習，但又缺少這些專門書籍，喬傑和素秋遂想出了計策，分頭向朋友和圖書館去借閱。書借來之後，夢鷗很努力的研究練習，雖時間到了午夜，他還沒有睡。</p>
<p>這天，夢鷗去江海大學授課去了，校長照例的向學生們介紹，並讚揚夢鷗是現代國內著名的立體幾何學家。校長向學生介紹過夢鷗之後，夢鷗開始授課了，但這些學生卻認得夢鷗是在？「女神」中飾屈原的那個人，而交頭接耳的密語著，夢鷗見眾學生耳語，他早起了惶恐，黑板所書的方式已錯誤了，這時又有一個學生立了起來向夢鷗說：「我們曉得先生是其名的藝術家，請先生課外講點歌劇的藝術吧」！夢鷗便回說：「不過現在是上課的時候」。接著他又說道：「我下次再來細談吧」。結果是，夢鷗感得力不能勝任斯職而辭退了。</p>
<p>素秋在這時謀到了一個小學校裏代課的職務，月薪只有十五元。但除了教課之外，還要包括著傭人，廚司，縫袵的職務，素秋因為失業了很久，所以對於這樣苛刻的職務，並不感覺得絲毫的苦。可是沒有多少時候，請代課的教員回校銷假了，學校當局雖對於素秋的工作勤勞表示很大的佩服，捨不得辭去素秋，但因為學校經濟不足，也只有忍痛的放棄了。</p>
<p>二房東又來要錢了，夢鷗只是呆坐在椅子上發楞，而不知道用什麼言語來回對才好，喬傑在二房東緊迫的索房金之下，無可奈何的把他在學校裏讀的一些中西書籍賣給收舊貨的小販。值一百多塊錢的書小販只出了一塊幾角錢給那二房東，但二房東依然不答應。在這時，素秋正從校裏持著一個月不到的十元薪金回來，於是素秋的十塊錢全給了二房東後，二房東始悻悻的走去。夢鷗在無可奈何中，又將他最後剩餘的一只心愛的梵亞林賣去了。當他賣給買主，買主呌他奏一只曲子給他聽時，他的熱淚已奪眶的流出，素秋，喬傑也不能抑制的流著斷線似的淚珠，但另外一些鄰人們卻在哈哈的譏笑著。</p>
<p>第二天的早上，素秋首先發現了喬傑的失蹤，只尋覓到喬傑的一封留書，他是這樣的寫著：「夢鷗：在二十元一擔米的境況下，我再也不忍停留在你的家裏，來分掉你們一份糧。雖你和你的夫人還是那麼赤誠的照料我，但是正因為了這樣，更增加了我的痛苦。現在我的前途還是渺茫得很，但我不能不走了。我的好友再會吧。」</p>
<p>時間是飛般的快，一霎間又是幾年了，而夢鷗與素秋依然是掙扎在失業的苦痛生活中，同時，他們又增加了一個負擔，而是有了小孩子了。一天，素秋在招請欄見到一則某公館掃請家庭老師的廣告，就去應考了。結果，素秋是被錄取了，但巧的這個公館就是柳榮曼娜的公館，因為柳榮曼娜卻不認識素秋，所以當夢鷗問素秋是在什麼公館裏充任教師時，素秋是隱瞞著沒告訴就是曼娜的公館，恐怕引動了他的舊恨。</p>
<p>素秋每天到曼娜的公館教授她的孩子，也把自己的孩子帶去。小孩子是不懂得什麼貴賤貧富的，有時曼娜的孩子玩著很多的玩具，素秋的孩子見了也要玩，而曼娜的孩子不許他玩時，於是便爭奪起來，由爭奪而相打。素秋的小孩雖被曼娜的小孩擊倒在地上哭著，但素秋卻不敢聲張。她內心的苦痛，真不是筆所能形容的！（未完）</p>

<h3>汽車引擎上常遇的障碮及修理法</h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>駕駛汽車時。每每有種種的困難發生。這種困難。大半是在引擎內發生。其原因很複雜。例如引撆掣動困難等。但假使在一種困難發生後。逐步的作有系統的在引擎各部搜索。則不難立卽發現其因難的原因。然後再想補救的方法。一般沒有經騐的駕駛員。一遇引擎上任何困難。卽不顧一切猛烈地使用掣動機。或猛搖車頭曲拐軸。這種魯莽的舉動。在你沒有發現原因以前。萬不能使用。因爲有時候竟會使你的掣動機損傷極烈。這是必須注意到的。</p>
<p>汽車引擎障碍的主要原因。不外（一）引擎本身障碍。（二）燃燒系統發生困難。（三）碳化器內部變故。照普通的習貫。可以先視察燃制。然後碳化器。最後引擎本部。茲將常遇的引撆降碍及其原因的分析。列表如下。至於補救的方法。則詳述於表後。</p>
<p>現象　發生原因及部分　原因的分析</p>
<p>引擎障碍　（甲）燃燒系發生困難　（一）火星活塞曾否有短路及空隙太大的現象　（二）皮綫曾否破裂或遇鐵　（三）分播制曾否積污</p>
<p>（乙）碳化器內部故障</p>
<p>（一）器內有否積水，（二）細管內淸潔否，（三）器內有否氣體或壓力，（四）汽油供給是否太少，（五）細管內恐有氣泡阻塞，</p>
<p>（丙）引擎本部變故</p>
<p>（一）引擎周圍溫度太低，（二）氣舌彈簧恐有積垢及損壞，</p>
<p>碳化器過早　（甲）燃燒系發生困難　（一）綫路錯接否，（二）汽缸燃燒次序恐有顚倒，</p>
<p>燃燒　（乙）碳化器內部故障　（一）碳化器內恐有積水，輸送管積汚阻塞，（三）碳化器內無壓力或氣體存在，（四）器內汽油給量不足，</p>
<p>引擎內部衝撞　（丙）引擎本部變故　（一）引入氣舌彈簧恐有積垢及損壤　（甲）燃燒系發生困難（一）燃燒太早　（乙）引擎本部變故　（一）汽缸積碳（燃燒太早），（二）引擎燃燒過熱，（三）承軸太鬆，（四）活塞寬鬆，</p>
<p>引擎缺少能力的輸給</p>
<p>（甲）燃燒系部分　（一）火星爆發减速</p>
<p>（乙）碳化器部分　（一）汽油給量太多，輸送管關閉，</p>
<p>（丙）引擎部分　（一）放氣舌動作作不佳，（二）汽缸內積碳很多，（三）引擎燃燒過熱，（四）缺少潤滑油，（五）調整機動作不佳，</p>
<p>引擎溫度過高</p>
<p>（丁）制動機部分　（一）有否阻碍，</p>
<p>（戊）齧合準部分　（一）滑脫作用，</p>
<p>（甲）燃燒系部分　（一）火星爆發遞减，</p>
<p>（乙）碳化器部分　（一）汽油供給過多</p>
<p>（丙）引擎部分　（一）冷凝器作用不佳（風扇皮帶脫落，循環水量不够）（二）汽缸內積碳（三）潤滑不佳</p>
<p>引擎突然停止</p>
<p>（甲）引擎與車身慢慢停止　（一）燃料的缺乏</p>
<p>（乙）引擎與車身突然停止　（一）機械變故</p>
<p>（丙）引擎突然停止，車身　（一）燃燒系發生故障慢慢停止</p>
<p>引擎不停前進</p>
<p>（甲）燃燒系部分　（一）皮綫破裂，（二）開關機械無效力，</p>
<p>（乙）燃燒過早　（一）積碳在汽缸內過多，（二）引擎溫度過高，</p>
<p>上列幾種引擎障礙現象及原因。究竟用什麼方法來鑑別呢。這是非常簡單而隨便什麼駕駛汽車員。（有汽車常識或沒有汽車常識）只要照下面所述幾節。時時留心。就可以很明白的鑑別各種困難。</p>
<p>假使汽車在行駛時。引擎慚慚停止作用。那麼引擎的幾個汽缸。或是所有的汽缸。一定發生了障礙。也許是燃燒不按時期或是氣舌黏住所致。發生障礙的汽缸可用螺絲　置於每個塞子上。使他們短路（一端接塞子的中極。另一端則觸引擎上的電極。如其對於引擎毫無作用。那麽這個汽缸就沒有爆發作用。然後冉視察燃燒制。把這塞子上的皮線移近中極。觀察有否火星爆發。如其有的。那麽這個塞子一定是「短路」。就是說塞子已積碳過多或絕緣體破裂。如其沒有火星　那麼困難的發生。一定不在塞子上。而在以上部分。如其引擎中僅有一個汽缸不爆發。那麽恐是分播器與塞子間的障礙。可先視察分播器是否淸潔。及綫路有否遇鐵或外皮破裂的現象。</p>
<p>火星爆發塞障礙最確實的測定法。可把不爆發和爆發汽缸上的塞子交換一下。如其第二汽缸也不爆發。那麼這塞孑必定要細細的淸潔一下。或是換一個新的。</p>
<p>如其燃燒系沒有缺點發現。第二步可利用手搖曲拐軸以觀察各個汽缸內的壓縮是否同一。不良的歷縮是由於活寒的滲漏和氣舌的呆笨。這足使引擎能力缺少。但是對於汽缸爆發沒有影響。氣舌的位置不適當才是汽缸不爆發的眞實原因。這種氣舌可以很容易用器械修理他。</p>
<p>如其引擎時停時走。那麽是碳化器內積水所致。或是汽汕流通不暢。這可以隨時加以修理。有時引擎發動後。卽有常常停止的現象發生。那由於引擎溫度過低所致。這僅是時間短少問題。別無他故。</p>
<p>如引擎發火過早。那可以先視察路綫及發火次序表。也許電磁準的滑脫作用。有時碳化器積水過多。汽油給量突然停止。結果亦能使發火過早。</p>
<p>上列的幾種汽車引擎困難。大半已完全無遺。修理的方法很多。總括的說。（一）除去積碳—如汽缸內有積碳。可以先把缸首除去。用人工方法。或用氫氣除掉她。大半碳素除去後。績用火油輕擦。可以除去很小的碳屑。氣舌上的積碳。可用拭子拭去。動作須輕而小心。（二）燃料供給制的留意—汽油在未入油箱前。必須濾過。碳化器內之積水。必須時時倒去。（三）綫路的視察—各種的綫路。如製動。電燈。及燃燒制綫路。應當時時視察。遇鐵的現象。（Grounded）必須時時避免。如綫外的包皮微有損壤。必須立刻調換新綫。綫路上慎勿積聚油汚等不潔物。綫端銜接處均應用金屬銲過。（四）火星塞子的視察—火星塞子關係重要。應當常常保持淸潔。不宜有碳屑依附。塞子上的瓷質。不宜破裂。塞子淸潔時。務須輕輕取下。用汽油拭洗。二塞子間的距離。應爲三十二分之一英寸到六十四分之一英寸。</p>
<p>其餘小的地方尙多。因限於篇幅。不克備載。以上數端。最爲重要。如能時時留意。大半引擎障礙。卽能免去了。</p>
<h3>一九三五年式格來亨八缸新車槪述</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>關於摧汽汽車。一般人士。向皆心存歧視。不無懷疑之處。但自一九三五年式格來亨直列八缸式新車貢獻於世以來。種種疑慮。今已不攻自破。新車之動作效能。雖與價値昂貴之運動式並無</p>
<p>左爲道奇五人座旅行轎車，輪距長一百二十八英寸，車廂極寬敞舒適之至。</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>稍異。而其安靜平穩與堅　。以及由冰冷時發動之便易。暨汽油燃用之經濟。並皆出色當行。逈不可及。新車優點。不一而是。茲姑以其概况。略述如次。</p>
<p>八缸式擎。裝配並列汽門。鋁質汽缸頭。興五粒軸承之均衡拐軸。摧汽機爲離心式。廻旋樞係以高度展引力之鋁質合金製成。以五又四分之三倍於拐軸速度騙動之。故當引擎於每分鐘四千轉。產生最高實馬力一百三十五匹時。其駛動爲每分鐘二萬三千轉。按雖有此高速。但摧汽機平常仍無聲響可開。卽在駕水疾駛之際。亦僅稍發微　。廻旋樞殻。　以水套。引擎於已經停止相當時間後。仍然隨卽發動。無處停頓。變速機爲專常三擋速度式。配有無　二擋。與偕動式末擋及二擋（單片式接合器。並可選裝活輪。如用中間齒輪比率。速度達每小時六千英里。</p>
<p>轎車全部勻稱。外觀式機。彌極美妙動人。全車　用安全玻璃。通氣翼翅。鉸於屏風柱上。後季窗則可向外鉸釘。內部舒滴異常。一切附件應有盡有。表板中置大速度表。其中包括汽油表等。後座兩旁有架。並於正中裝有摺　靠臂架。車身爲紙合式。搆製堅强鞏固之至。接筍處完全絕綠。摺　行李架。爲其標凖裝置。但如欲改裝嵌就式行李箱。祇須加費少許。卽可照改。此外特備之件。以供選用者。計有第二備輪。顏色翼翅。眞皮或冲皮　靠等。要而言之。格來亨新車。蓋一搆製精良。設備齋全。效用宏偉。價値高超。確能使人滿意之眞正傑搆也。</p>
<p>上圖為特別任重之一九三五年式福特V八貨車，包涵四十九種改良特色，加工設計，所以使載重支配適當，駕駛輕易，引擎效率增高，並使駕駛者更爲舒適安全，其前後輪間距離爲一百五十七英寸，裝有欄杆車身及複式後輪，</p>
<h3>談華貴式小轎車</h3>
<p>— 實</p>
<p>最爲汽車家所歡迎</p>
<p>汽車式樣，種類殊多，其中究以何者最爲一般汽車家所樂用耶，關於此層，殆可由世界最大汽車製造廠之一，奧斯汀汽車公司，最近發表各種式樣奧斯汀及一切設備之銷數報告，觀察之也，</p>
<p>依據該公司此項報告，華貴式小轎車，實爲目今最爲人所歡迎之一種式樣，如以奧期汀出品而論，七匹馬力式之需要，較十馬力四缸式尤爲殷亟，如購置固定車頂無特殊改良裝置之轎車者一人，則需要華貴式者當有六人至七人，至蓬車與轎車之此較，，則爲轎車，銷數十有三輛，蓬車則僅銷一輛，按以海外貿易言之，蓬車銷數，當然較爲增加，但與轎車相較，仍不逮遠甚，蓋如蓬車銷去一輛，轎車銷數則爲四輛，仍達四與一之比也，至於顏色，則目下最受歡迎者，厥爲黑色，惟翠藍色現已爲一般人所愛悅，假令此種趨向，繼續不變，當有取黑色而代之可能，除此之外，棕色綠色及灰色等亦皆爲人所喜者，</p>
<h3>一九三五的英國汽車業陣容</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>雙耐克勞夫汽車製造廠於過去已有驚人之成績。一九三五年之雙耐克勞夫於英國汽車業中將呈一異彩也。現在所决定者爲數十　　　　　　　　　　　底盤之六十餘種外。更有客車底盤之一類。在各種底盤上皆可拆卸裝配之靈巧配合可能。修理尤十分便利。又可各車互相掉換。每一種類均可移動。有各種長度之輪距。四缸六六缸之機件。用汽油或其他燃料之製品。以便顧主之隨意選取。</p>
<p>星球汽車製造業之於英國汽車界中占有光榮之聲譽者也。過去曾有一百三十餘次之汽車競賽爲星球汽車所獲勝者。而小星球汽車之在世界上固爲一般人所素爲注意者。與奧斯汀小汽車皆爲世界聞名效率佳良之汽車也。一九三五年之星球汽車製造業亦有擴大之計劃。其製造方面亦有種種改革之方針。如汽車身體之流綫化以求適應於時代之潮流。及改進機械之部份。使效率更見增進車身之裝璜亦特見注重。如彈簧之配合巧妙。及摩擦部份之力球光滑無礙。减少阻力。其大體雖仍如舊而無巨大之更革。其小處之革新則甚多者也。</p>
<p>多寳塔廠之汽車製造部份爲英國近年甚有地位之汽車製造業也。自一九三三年之後更日新月異。進步無可言喻。一九三四年中之多寳塔汽車製造部較之一九三三年擴大一倍又餘。已爲汽車界之中驚奇之一事。而於一九三四年之年底又决定其擴大之方針。現値一九三五年。多寳塔廠將增加工人百分之五十。又將擴大全廠之一倍。現在之多竇塔廠　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　設立分廠。該廠之主要出品爲汽車之附件。如馬律斯及司丹達之彈簧裝　皆爲多寶塔廠之出品。一九三五年之該項出品必有更精密驚人之發展也。</p>
<p>馬律斯汽車亦爲近年汽水界中之著名份子。一九三四年中之名譽亦不見示弱。故於一九三五年中之革新計劉亦頗見週密。現在之馬律斯汽水一九三五式已見决定。然其决定在前。現在更將已决定之一九三五式汽車大加修改。雖首批已見製出。其修改亦非難事。該廠之負責人稱。馬律斯汽車之價格蠅略見貴於其他之汽取。然如以汽車之質量言之並有未定價高昂之事也。馬律斯汽車之製造計劃並不圖一時之巨利。惟圖永久爲社會服務。故一九三五年稅率减低之後。卽以其减低之數量從事於汽車各部之極力革新方面。使車主不至損失。</p>
<p>今日之一般汽車皆於運輸汽車之機件上裝置汽油引擎。現英國AEC重油引擎之運輸汽車問世。該項工廠製出此種引擎之原理。用隔離之法使有相當之壓力透達空氣。而增加轉動之速率燃料輸送半均。行動亦完全一致。又無烟煤之氣味發生。現在英國之公共汽車大多採用此項重油引擎而馬力七十五匹之四缸公共汽車效力宏大。一九三五年又有萊勒特廠之努力於計劃重油引擎。恐未來之世界上運輸汽車將完全爲該式樣矣。</p>
<p>又愛勒克油公司之抽油管亦爲英國汽車業中之別開生面者。此　抽油管已經證明爲奇巧之發明汽車之須載　量者。成須行長距離者。中途有發生阻碍之時用抽油管之裝置卽可避免　種不良之阻滯使機件之發動能力增加。此廠於一九三五中亦將有巨大之貢獻云云。</p>
<h3>雪佛蘭七座大轎車問世</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>美國通用汽車製造總廠爲應遠東市塲之需要起見。特製一九三五年式雪佛蘭七座華貴大轎車一種。專供遠東顧客購用。該車輸距爲一二四又四分之三吋。車身式樣美麗。座位寬敞舒適。全車構造。均與遠東公路之情形相適。並有五座轎式蓬車一種。輸距亦爲一二四又四分之三吋。內部特形寬敞。最適宜於內地軍用。該種加大客車。不日卽將運華。從此夙以嬌小玲瓏著譽之雪佛蘭汽車。同時將並躋於巨型汽卓之列矣。</p>

<h3>Guizhou Circles Welcome Chairman Chiang: Chiang's Address at the Welcome Meeting: Eradicate Opium Addiction and Become Healthy Citizens; Change to Planting Agricultural Crops and Create a Prosperous Province</h3>
<p>Guiyang: This morning at 10:00 AM, all circles in the province held a meeting at the Provincial Party Headquarters auditorium to welcome Chairman Chiang. At the same time, an enlarged memorial week was held, attended by approximately one thousand people including Xue Yue, He Chengjun, Li Zhonggong, He Yun, various party committees, provincial committees, and representatives from various groups and schools. At 10:00 AM, Chairman Chiang arrived, and amidst simultaneous military music and cannon salutes, Chairman Chiang led the attendees in performing the formalities. Party Committee member Ping Gang delivered a welcome speech. Chiang then gave a speech, roughly stating that in the past, due to various reasons such as external worries and internal troubles, the central government was unable to attend to the suffering of the people of Guizhou. From now on, if the compatriots of Guizhou can strive to become healthy citizens under the leadership of the central government and the Three Principles of the People, they will definitely be able to build a new Guizhou. There are two sources of the people's suffering: one is due to political and military relations, and the other is due to the people's insufficient knowledge and lack of effort. To alleviate the people's suffering, one cannot rely entirely on the government; it is truly necessary for the people themselves to rise up and save themselves, to rise up and strive diligently, in order to find the right path. This time I have come to Guizhou for two purposes: one is to suppress bandits, and the other is to find ways to realize the Three Principles of the People in order to protect the people of Guizhou and enable them to live and work in peace. I hope that the compatriots of Guizhou can support the central government and assist the central government in implementing policies in order to fulfill the mission of the people, then Guizhou will definitely be able to enjoy long-term peace and stability. As for my contributions today, there are two points: the primary task to alleviate the suffering of the people of Guizhou is to eradicate opium addiction. If this point cannot be resolved, then nothing else can be discussed. One must be physically strong in order to seek knowledge and progress. To cultivate the local area, one must first cultivate oneself. Secondly, it must be understood that Guizhou is not poor. If opium is not planted and various agricultural crops are planted instead, and if mineral resources can be developed, then Guizhou will naturally be prosperous. I hope that the compatriots and comrades of Guizhou will understand this meaning in order to create a prosperous province and exemplary people of China. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 1st)</p>

<h3>Methods for Manufacturing and Using the Party and National Flag: The General Headquarters Issues a Circular for Guidance</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The General Headquarters considers the Party and National Flag to be a symbol representing the Party and the nation, solemn and sacred, rarely comparable. The central government has established methods for its manufacture and use. Many local agencies, groups, and social organizations have conscientiously followed them, but there are also many who have not manufactured and used them in accordance with the regulations. If corrections and prohibitions are not implemented, it will be impossible to correct the public image and revere the Party and the nation. The original text of the joint instruction to the provinces and cities is recorded below: The Party and National Flag is a symbol representing the Party and the nation, the embodiment of national spirit, and the focus of international attention, solemn and sacred, rarely comparable. Regarding the dimensions, proportions, star angles, light rays, distances, as well as the diagrams and patterns, the central government had already made detailed arrangements at the 173rd Standing Committee meeting on October 8, 17th year, and special articles were also established at the 136th Standing Committee meeting on August 30, 23rd year, regarding the manufacturing and usage regulations. All provinces and cities should have paid special attention and conscientiously followed them, but upon investigation in recent years, the Party and National Flags and Party emblems prepared by various local agencies, groups, and social organizations, have mostly been manufactured according to the regulations, but there are also many that do not meet the specified dimensions, or have light rays that are too long or too short, or circles that are particularly large or small. This is all because the local governments and party headquarters at all levels have considered the matter to be trivial and have not made rectifications, which is not conducive to establishing the dignity of the Party and the nation and correcting the public perception. It is now specifically stipulated that the governments and party headquarters at all levels in each province and city should follow the manufacturing and usage regulations of the Party and National Flag, and the dimension and pattern tables, repeatedly promulgated by the central government, and promptly investigate, guide corrections, prohibit, and confiscate in order to correct the public image and revere the Party and the nation. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued for compliance, and for transmission to subordinates for unified compliance, and for reporting the compliance situation at any time as necessary. This order! (Central News Agency dispatch of the 2nd)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industries Investigates and Reports on Sichuan Industries</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industries' He Minyi's report on the investigation of Sichuan's industries: (1) Agriculture: Mountains account for seven-tenths of the province, and plains only exist in three areas: Chengdu, Tongchuan, and Kaijiang. If seeds can be improved and opium poppies eliminated, the entire province would have a surplus of grain for over 25 million people. Currently, it is only just enough. Land prices have fallen from 130 yuan per mu to 75 yuan per mu, and few people are asking about it. Taxes range from 30% of income for higher rates to 8% for lower rates, but the burden is still slightly lighter than that of paddy fields in Guangdong province. (2) Mining: The ore layers are very thin, and the output is not as good as Hunan. State-run operations seem unnecessary. Copper mines are not abundant, only 2%. Silver and gold are not optimistic, and there is no need for large-scale operations. However, the iron ore deposits are quite thick, but transportation is inconvenient. Before starting operations, a drainage channel to Leshan should be built, which would be a considerable expense. As for the coal and oil in Zigong, Chinese and foreign scholars have explored it in many ways but cannot make a definite assessment. The oil layer is 4,000 feet deep, but with the old-style cable-tool drilling method, only 3,000 feet can be reached. Without an investment of millions, it is impossible to start. (3) Water Conservancy: The steepness of the rivers is extremely high, and there are 38 places where hydroelectric power plants can be built. However, the electricity generated should be utilized as an ancillary benefit to factories; otherwise, simply generating electricity for lighting is not appropriate. There are still not many raw materials available. Items like cotton, iron, and copper still need to be sought from outside. There are also very few mechanical factories. If the collection of industrial raw materials is not prioritized, even with water conservancy, it would be equivalent to nothing. Taking the upper reaches of the Min River as an example, in addition to man-made weirs and diversion channels irrigating 5 million mu of land, it can also generate 10,000 kilowatts of electricity. After all, with an investment of 3 million yuan, how the electricity generated can be used is still not budgeted. (The area can purchase wool from Qinghai, Southern Gansu, and Northern Sichuan, but the quantity is small and the wool is too coarse.) In summary, the things in Sichuan province that are currently worth studying are: 1) The iron mines in Zhongjing, 2) The coal and oil in Zigong (Other places, such as Ba County, Zizhong, and Daxi counties, have very small quantities), 3) The water conservancy of the entire Sichuan province, which can be jointly assessed with local authorities in the future to create a systematic report. As for the local handicrafts and the influence of foreign merchants in Sichuan, as well as the general situation of medicinal materials and tung oil, there are fragmented reports.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Shaking of the European Gold Standard Bloc</h3>
<p>— (A Cold Observation)</p>
<p>Recently, the Belgian cabinet was reorganized. Chirel became the new prime minister. In the House of Representatives, he announced the government's policy, and its currency-related measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Suspension of cash convertibility.</p>
<p>(2) Devaluation of the currency by 25%, aiming to maintain a comparable exchange rate with the British pound. Implemented from March 31.</p>
<p>(3) Creation of an exchange equalization fund.</p>
<p>(4) Proposal for an international conference to seek stabilization of currencies among nations.</p>
<p>This proposal was passed by the Belgian House of Representatives on March 30, and approved by the Senate on the same day. Before the aforementioned policy was announced, the Belgian government first ordered the stock exchange to close for three days. Everyone expected that the value of the Belgian currency would soon decrease. There was a major upheaval in the exchange market. The Belgian currency fell to 24 francs to the pound. Belgium has been a major exporter of steel and cement. Since the devaluation of the British pound, sales have been greatly reduced. Now that the devaluation of the Belgian franc has become a reality, these Belgian goods can compete with British goods in the UK and overseas. The most affected is the French economy. Belgium was originally in the same gold standard bloc as France. The devaluation of the Belgian currency inevitably discourages those who support the gold franc. Those who hold French bonds will sell them on the market and buy foreign securities. Capital flight may be unavoidable. Whether France can maintain the gold standard hereafter is uncertain.</p>
<p>The gold standard bloc was created on July 3, 1933. At that time, the World Economic Conference was held in London. The US representative opposed stabilizing international exchange rates, resulting in the conference ending without results. France, Belgium, and other countries made an agreement to issue a declaration, strongly advocating maintaining the gold standard. In October of last year, the countries participating in this bloc included France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Poland. They held a meeting in Brussels and maintained their original purpose, and planned to promote trade between the countries. The specific measures were not immediately decided. The reason why these countries formed this gold bloc during the fierce currency war was because they feared that abandoning the gold standard would inevitably lead to currency inflation, repeating the chaotic currency situation during the Great War. However, maintaining it permanently is also quite difficult. Other countries use the means of lowering the currency value to compete in dumping. The currency values of France, Belgium, and other countries are relatively high, making it impossible for them to compete in exporting manufactured goods. Recently, the business of the countries in the gold bloc has declined compared to before, which may be due to this. Belgium was originally a pillar of the bloc. Once it takes the lead in breaking away and abandoning the gold standard, it affects the whole body with one move. The impact is quite significant. What will be the trend hereafter? There are two arguments: pessimistic and optimistic. Those who hold the pessimistic view say that the disintegration of the bloc has already begun. Other countries will inevitably follow suit. Although France has a lot of gold reserves, how can it adhere to its original purpose and remain calm in this environment? If it follows in Belgium's footsteps, the situation of the currency war will become more serious, and international disputes will become more unresolvable. The extraordinary period is approaching. Those who hold the optimistic view say that the devaluation of the Belgian currency does not necessarily mean that other countries participating in the bloc will follow suit. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 29th of last month, the Dutch government still plans to protect the "florin" (Dutch currency) and is making every effort to cut the budget in order to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure, so as to avoid financial difficulties affecting finance. With the Netherlands' attitude like this, will France act rashly? Even if the gold standard bloc dissolves from now on, who knows if the opportunity for international currency stabilization will not be promoted by Belgium's move?</p>
<p>Which of the above two arguments is right or wrong will be clarified by future facts. Let's not discuss it for now. However, the author believes that there are two points worth noting at present. (1) The abandonment of the gold standard by Belgium shows that the gold standard bloc in Europe already has cracks, and the increasingly fierce currency war is a major reason for the cracks in the gold standard bloc. (2) According to news reports, after Belgium abandoned the gold standard, prices rose and society was quite uneasy. Therefore, there are many people in the country who oppose the new cabinet's policy. China's economic situation is very different from that of the UK, the US, Japan, Belgium, and other countries. Therefore, the currency system cannot be easily changed, causing disturbances. Fortunately, China's currency policy has not changed, and the currency system has not been altered. Therefore, during this period of economic panic, all industries and businesses can calmly respond and strive to save themselves. If we imitate those countries, inflate the currency, and devalue the currency, I am afraid that the negative effects will be seen before the actual benefits.</p>

<h3>Eden's Social Activities in Warsaw: Met with the Polish Foreign Minister Yesterday Morning, Attended Presidential Luncheon, and Visited Piłsudski in the Afternoon. Anglo-Russian Coordination Causes Significant Unease in Germany.</h3>
<p>Warsaw - British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden is scheduled to discuss various points outlined in the Anglo-French communiqué of February 3rd with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck at 11:00 AM this morning. It is anticipated that Colonel Beck will firmly express Poland's reservations about the Eastern European Pact, as Poland and many others believe that bilateral agreements are more valuable in enhancing security, preventing Poland from being drawn into conflicts it considers avoidable.</p>
<p>Eden arrived here at 8:00 PM last night, receiving a warm welcome. Among those who greeted him at the station were Foreign Minister Beck, Polish Ambassador to the UK Raczyński, British Ambassador to Poland Kennard, and staff members of the British Embassy. Eden's talks here will conclude on Wednesday, after which he will travel to Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, for a brief exchange of views. He will then return to London by plane on Thursday evening to report the results of this trip, which will be carefully studied by the British Cabinet along with a report submitted by British Foreign Secretary Simon. The purpose of this trip was to ascertain the opinions of the countries concerned, and it was exploratory in nature, not intended to achieve concrete results. Therefore, it can be said that the goal has been achieved at this stage. As for the British government's stance on the turbulent situation in Europe, it will not be immediately expressed, as all matters need to be thoroughly discussed by the statesmen of Britain, France, and Italy at a meeting next week. Subsequently, the League of Nations Council will also convene in the coming days to exchange views. The location of the three-nation meeting has been decided to be the famous 17th-century Palazzo Borromeo in Stresa, which boasts Italy's most magnificent halls and scenic views. (February 2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Warsaw - British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden arrived here last night from Moscow. The Polish government specially prepared a train to welcome him at the border. When Eden arrived at the station, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, British Chargé d'affaires Aveling, and embassy staff were present to greet him. Eden and his party then proceeded to the Hotel Europejski to stay. (February 2nd, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>Eden's Compromise Proposal</p>
<p>Warsaw - British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden discussed the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact with Polish Foreign Minister Beck this morning. He then visited Polish Prime Minister Kozłowski and attended a luncheon at the tomb of President Mościcki. In the afternoon, he will visit Polish dictator and Minister of Military Affairs Piłsudski. Tomorrow, Eden will depart for Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, marking the end of his last visit and concluding his itinerary. Today, a senior Polish official declared to Havas that "Poland considers the territorial integrity of Lithuania to be of vital interest, just as Britain does for Belgium." Therefore, rumors suggest that Poland is deeply concerned about Germany's eastward expansion plans. If the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact can be amended with more flexible terms, and if Britain could join similar commitments as in Central Europe, where Britain could participate in inter-state consultations when Poland's territorial integrity is threatened, then Poland might consider joining the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. Well-informed sources believe that Eden may propose a compromise Eastern European security plan, as the Polish government has consistently refused to allow foreign troops to enter Polish territory. Therefore, Eden proposes that the mutual assistance terms be limited to airspace only, allowing the air forces of future signatory countries of the Eastern European Pact to fly over Polish territory in the event of an act of aggression, but prohibiting the entry of foreign troops into Polish territory. Such a plan might be acceptable to Poland. (February 2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>Meeting Proposes Solutions</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM this morning, Eden met with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, and the scope of the discussion included the points outlined in the Anglo-French communiqué of February 3rd. The details of the discussion have not been disclosed. It is believed that Beck stated that the suspicion of Soviet Russia that Poland has already concluded an alliance with Germany, with the main purpose of defending against Russian aggression, is unfounded. The talks ended at noon, and Eden then attended a banquet hosted by Polish President Mościcki. In the afternoon, he will discuss matters with Army Chief General Piłsudski at Belweder Palace. General Piłsudski often enjoys receiving guests during tea time, frequently sipping tea and forgetting how many cups he has had. It seems that today, he will use tea instead of wine to toast the distinguished British guest. In the evening, Beck will host a banquet to welcome Eden.</p>
<p>A Reuters reporter learned today that the Polish Army General Staff still opposes the Polish-German alliance. Poland does not seem to want to explicitly reject the Eastern European Pact immediately, but feels that the bilateral non-aggression pacts it has concluded with neighboring countries should be incorporated into the pact's framework. It is believed that during the talks between the two statesmen this morning, Beck put forward a practical plan to make the Eastern European Pact acceptable to Poland without giving Germany grounds for opposition. This may be the main difference in opinion between the two sides in the discussion. It is said that Polish leaders now feel compelled to take decisive steps, as the opposition party is strongly advocating that Poland clarify its foreign policy. It is reported that during this morning's talks, Eden explained the situation of his meetings with authorities in Berlin and Moscow, whereupon Beck explained Poland's position on the issues under discussion and stated that the Polish government has invited French Foreign Minister Laval to visit Warsaw. (February 2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Warsaw - This morning, when British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden held talks with Foreign Minister Beck, Eden first explained in detail the impressions and information he obtained in Berlin and Moscow. Then, Beck elaborated on the Polish government's views on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. According to reliable sources, Eden and Beck have now drafted a compromise approach, based on the existing non-aggression treaties, adding clauses such as "non-assistance to aggressor countries" and "definition of aggressor countries." At the same time, they will conclude a consultation pact, similar to the consultation pact guaranteeing Austria's independence. Well-informed sources believe that Britain will not refuse to participate in this Eastern European consultation pact, and therefore, political circles have expressed optimism. (February 2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>Poland's Attitude</p>
<p>Warsaw - British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden has arrived here, and talks between the two sides will begin soon. The Polish government, influenced by recent events, may change its attitude towards the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, or at least reconsider it. Poland is deeply concerned about Germany's eastward expansion plan, which is not deeply hidden by its leader Hitler. Therefore, well-informed sources believe that if the Eastern European Pact can be replaced by a more flexible plan instead of mutual assistance terms, or if Britain can accept a promise regarding safeguarding Poland's territorial integrity and participate in consultation procedures, as it has done regarding Austria's territorial integrity, then the Polish government will be prepared to sign the Eastern European Pact.

<p>Warsaw - The semi-official Polish Telegraphic Agency commented on the visit of British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden, stating that Warsaw welcomes him with sympathy and recognizes the importance of the current situation. It said, "The League of Nations system is at a critical juncture, and there are only two ways to save it: one is to focus on the reality of the situation and seek improvement, and the other is to establish a new system, but the latter is more difficult." The report also stated that the atmosphere between Britain and Poland is similar, "Although Polish policy is not rash, it does not ignore the seriousness of the situation. Fortunately, the objectives and methods adopted by both British and Polish policies are aimed at calmness and prudence, and the route followed by British cabinet members from London via Paris, Berlin, Moscow, to Warsaw is the central axis of the cause of peace."

<p>Germany Feels Deeply Uneasy</p>
<p>(Berlin) - The agreement between Britain and Russia on appropriate methods for consolidating European peace has caused great unease in Germany today. Although the government does not outwardly acknowledge the success of Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden's meeting in Moscow, Eden's triumphant return and the daily announcements of coordination between the two countries on various international issues have caused a noticeable sense of unease among the public. As for the meeting between Hitler and Simon, it certainly achieved nothing. Germany wants to maintain Britain's goodwill regarding the abandonment of the treaty and rearmament, because France and Italy have lodged serious protests and will likely do everything possible to obstruct Germany's plans. At the same time, Germany's military mobilization and plans to manufacture cannons and aircraft are still ongoing, regardless of how other countries feel. (February 2nd, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>Glimpses of the French Press</p>
<p>(Paris) - Newspapers review the course of the Moscow talks and express satisfaction, hoping that Poland can change its original attitude towards the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. "L'Action Française" believes that Soviet Russia should sign a four-nation pact with the three major Western European powers of Britain, France, and Italy, and allow Germany to join on its own. It also said that British Foreign Secretary Simon may convene a European conference before French Foreign Minister Laval goes to Russia. This conference, which has been rumored for some time, will have eight to ten participating countries, including Germany. "Paris-Soir" reported that Britain does not intend to join the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact but accepts other measures, such as Britain being willing to consult with other countries if aggression occurs in Eastern Europe. The report also said, "It is heard that British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden has given assurances to Soviet Communist Party Secretary Stalin that if Germany attacks a neighboring country in the east and France intervenes due to an alliance, then Britain will not consider such intervention to be a violation of the Locarno Treaty." "Le Matin" said that Germany's military buildup is imminent, and Poland will therefore change its attitude and be willing to participate in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact with the Soviet Union. "Le Petit Journal" also said that Poland is willing to participate in this pact with the Soviet Union at the same time. (February 2nd, Havas)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Warns the Italian People: Do Not Have Excessive Expectations for the Upcoming Three-Nation Meeting</h3>
<p>(Rome) - Prime Minister Mussolini apparently instructed the Italian newspapers to publish an article warning the Italian people not to have excessive expectations for the upcoming three-nation meeting to be held in Italy. The report declared that it is necessary to temper the wine of optimism. In short, the Italian people do not want to harbor any illusions. There has never been anything more tragic in the world than hoping for something to materialize from illusory expectations. Therefore, it is our duty to warn in advance. This is not to say that we deliberately intend to undermine this meeting. We only want to place this meeting in its proper place within the diplomatic and military structure of modern European politics. This limitation does not leave room for extraordinary solutions or permanent solutions. If this meeting produces real results, there is nothing better. Italy not only hopes for this but will also work to make it happen. (February 2nd, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<h3>Phenomenon of Belgian Currency Devaluation: Prices Rise, Shops Crowded, Government Cracks Down on Speculation</h3>
<p>Beijing - The first day of the devaluation of the Belgian currency was characterized by crowded shops and rising prices of various goods. Since last week, buying has gradually increased, and many southern stores have been extremely busy, with some being forced to limit operating hours. Today, one woman purchased 400 bottles of wine, 20 pounds of pepper, and several gallons of vegetable oil. Several men also ordered more than a dozen suits of clothes. The price of meat has not changed, but imported milk oil has risen by 30%, coffee by 40%, English tea by 30%, and luxury goods have all risen by 30%. The government announced today that it will adopt active measures to crack down on speculation. (February 2nd, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The Pope Calls for Peace</h3>
<p>Vatican City - Today, the Pope gave a speech at the General Assembly of Bishops, urging world politicians to unite to dispel the recent spirit of war. The Pope condemned the hostile threat of nationalism and urged all religious and political groups to do their utmost to promote peace. The Pope said, "The news of war has aroused panic in people's hearts, but we also believe that it is time for us to take appropriate actions. We believe that if people fight each other again, it will be a terrible crime. If anyone commits it again, we can only ask God to punish these warmongers." (February 2nd, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Chinese Affairs: Development of Highways, Export Taxes, etc. No Current Intention to Upgrade British Legation in Beijing</h3>
<p>(London) - The House of Commons paid close attention to Chinese affairs during today's meeting, with members speaking and asking questions. The important questions related to the following matters: (1) Appointing renowned railway expert General Hammond to investigate and provide opinions on the organization of China's railway system. (2) The development of Chinese highways. (3) The upgrading of the British Legation in Beijing. (4) The activities of communist bandits in Sichuan. (5) China's export taxes. Conservative MP Maureen first asked about the appointment of General Hammond. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that General Hammond and two railway experts are scheduled to depart for China on April 4th. They will stay in China for about four months to provide advice on the organization of China's railways. Hammond's appointment is entirely the result of a temporary invitation from the Chinese government, and his mission is purely technical and advisory in nature, unrelated to politics. Conservative MP Charlton asked the government to pay attention to the development of Chinese highways in order to encourage the promotion of British bicycles. Overseas Trade Secretary Colville replied that the department had recently arranged for the Commercial Counsellor to China, who is currently in Britain, to visit various industrial centers in China to make British manufacturers aware of the possibility of promoting bicycles in China. Conservative MP Caine asked whether the British government had continued to consider following the Russian and Italian examples of upgrading the legation in China to the status of an embassy. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that the British government's attitude on this matter was explained by him in the House of Commons on November 5th last year, that is, the British government does not currently intend to upgrade the legation in Beijing. Conservative MP Knox followed up with a question about the extent of communist bandit activity above Hankou, especially in Sichuan province. Charlton also rose to speak, saying that the British government's negotiations with the Chinese government on China's export taxes, because these export taxes hinder British trade and are also an important factor hindering the recovery of China's trade balance. The Foreign Secretary replied that in recent years, China has abolished or reduced its export taxes on silk, rice, wheat, etc., and the Chinese government is likely aware of the adverse effects of export taxes as described by Charlton. He believes that it would be useless to negotiate with the Chinese government on this matter. It must be known that if China does not levy export taxes, it will have to find other ways to increase revenue, and the methods of raising funds will inevitably hinder commerce in the same or even worse way. Conservative MP Dale asked whether it would be possible to find a way to seek Sino-British cooperation to suppress pirates in Dapeng Bay and other places. Simon replied that such cooperation already exists, and he has received reports on the British naval authorities and Chinese sea and land authorities consulting with each other, but the content cannot be disclosed at this time.

<p>(London) - During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP MacDonald called attention to the official statement issued by the Japanese government, stating that the "Manchukuo" government's promise to maintain an open-door policy is conditional on foreign governments recognizing the new state. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that, according to telegrams, the "Manchukuo" government's compliance with the open-door policy is unconditional. The Japanese government's official document has not yet been received, so he is currently unable to make any statement. (February 1st, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Swiss Minister to Germany Protests to German Foreign Minister: Kidnapping of Journalist Violates Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland - After German journalist Berthold Jacob, who had fled to Switzerland, was kidnapped by German Nazis and taken back to Germany, the Swiss Minister to Germany protested to German Foreign Minister Neurath this morning, stating that Jacob's kidnapping was assisted by German officials and constituted a violation of Swiss sovereignty. Therefore, Jacob should be released immediately. It was also stated that Weismann, who is currently detained in Basel and is related to this case, confessed that Jacob was lured across the border, leading to his capture by German officials, and that it was not Jacob's own wish. President Musy declared to the Federal Council that the German government has refused to return Jacob to Switzerland, and the Federal Administrative Council will take all possible measures to ensure that this case is rectified.

<h3>Soviet Deputy Commissar of Defense Discusses German Military Preparations: Have Reached Pre-War Levels</h3>
<p>(Moscow) - Soviet Deputy People's Commissar of Defense Tukhachevsky wrote an article on Germany's current military plans, published in Pravda. Tukhachevsky pointed out that Germany has been continuously carrying out plans to establish a huge air force since Hitler came to power. He said, "In the third year of Hitler's rule, the German army has reached the level of the German army before the war. At the same time, because it has a powerful military aviation, its strength is greater than it was at that time." Tukhachevsky analyzed Germany's views on modern warfare, pointing out that Germany is most engaged in the organization of armies that can be used for aggression. The article elaborated on Germany's armed strength, discussing the air force, cavalry, infantry, artillery, armored vehicles, and motorized units, transportation corps, mechanical and chemical units, and navy, respectively. It estimates that Germany currently has a total military strength of 909,000 people. If the 60,000 people currently studying at civil aviation organizations are excluded, there will be 849,000 people by the end of 1935. Tukhachevsky said, "Finally, the aggressive army is stronger than the entire French peacetime military." Tukhachevsky also discussed Hitler's anti-Soviet plans, saying, "Hitler's imperialist plans are certainly not limited to anti-Sovietism, but this point is just enough to help him conceal his revenge plans in the south (Poznan, Czechoslovakia, the merger of Germany and Austria) and the west (Belgium and France). In addition, we cannot deny Germany's need for Sweden's iron ore. It also needs a vast naval base and wants to sacrifice Belgian ports and northern French ports to complete it. In order to realize its revenge and aggression plans, Germany must have at least 849,000 troops by the end of 1935. This number is 40% greater than France, and in terms of quantity, it is almost equal to the Soviet Union (the Soviet Union has a total of 940,000 troops of all types, but the Soviet Union's population is two and a half times greater than Germany's, and its territory is 45 times greater than Germany's). This is the reality of so-called equality in armaments." (February 1st, TASS)</p>
<p>(Moscow) - An editorial in the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia believes that Eden's trip and his talks with the Soviet government will have a good impact on the promotion of peace. "The first and most important result of the exchange of views between the British and Soviet governments is the statement that 'the two governments have no conflicting interests on any important issue of international policy, and at the same time, this point can be a solid foundation for the two countries to carry out effective cooperation for peace and to allow it to continue to develop.' Secondly, the point that the two countries are mutually concerned about maintaining the integrity of each other's territory is also extremely important. Some countries believe that Britain will inevitably be drawn into an anti-Soviet war and strive for British assistance in this war. This policy is based on the assumption of potential discord between Britain and the Soviet Union. However, in reality, Eden has stated on behalf of the British government that the British government is extremely opposed to actions that condone the outbreak of war anywhere, and that an anti-Soviet war would be contrary to British interests. In order to prevent war crises, the British and Soviet governments recognize the need to strengthen coordinated security organizations, and say that the best way is the regional mutual assistance pact. The Soviet government openly expressed its support for the Western Regional Pact, as a part of the general European security organization, while the British government also supported the Eastern Mutual Assistance Pact in the same spirit. Those who attempt to resolve the re-division of the world will again use intimidation and conspiracy to stir up Britain's anti-Soviet forces, but the solemn rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union has already begun. Soviet public opinion will measure the British government's policy by the degree of resoluteness with which it struggles for coordinated security. The Soviet Union is willing to cooperate with the British government in organizing collective security to reduce the crisis of war, and will further use this as a basis to seek the reality of universal disarmament. When estimating a country's foreign policy goals, the standard should be the extent to which it is actually (not just in words) preparing to struggle for the organization of collective security. Soviet public opinion deeply believes that the British people will welcome the rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union, and that they will be able to assist in any powerful steps that are sufficient to prevent the hardworking masses of all countries from becoming victims of the imperialists who are trying to re-divide the world. The Soviet Union has become a powerful force. It has caused the representatives of countries with different social systems to seriously consider that the Soviet Union's strength will be used to consolidate and defend universal peace." (February 1st, TASS)</p>
<p>(Moscow) - An editorial in Pravda said, "The results of the talks between the representatives of the British and Soviet governments are extremely important. The Soviet Union is very satisfied with its progress and results. After Eden's meeting with Soviet leaders and Stalin, it was able to confirm how firm the Soviet government's efforts to maintain peace are and how appropriate the Soviet Union's adherence to the keynote of its foreign policy is. Eden, having stated on behalf of the government that Britain is willing to maintain the integrity of Soviet territory, it can be known that the British government has rejected Germany's efforts to undermine the Soviet Union. The general concern for the construction of peace and security is the element that 'creates a solid foundation for effective cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union.' Therefore, the Anglo-Soviet talks have great political significance." (February 1st, TASS)</p>

<h3>Greek Parliament Dissolved; National Assembly to Convene on May 19th</h3>
<p>(Athens) Today, a clear order was issued to abolish the Greek Senate due to its ineffective performance and loss of value as a public institution. The Senate consisted of 120 members, at least nine-twelfths of whom were elected by the people every nine years. The remainder were elected by a joint session of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Athens) The government has recently decided to dissolve the House of Representatives, abolish the Senate, and hold elections for a National Assembly on May 19th to amend the constitution.

Before the election of the National Assembly, legislative power will be temporarily exercised by the government, which may issue special decrees to purify the administrative organs and abolish the lifetime tenure of judicial officials and civil servants. Premier Tsaldaris recently declared, "The government's decision to hold early elections is to seek the trust of the people and implement a revival policy. We firmly believe that the people will continue to trust the government, and the abnormal state caused by the Venizelos faction will hopefully come to an end." (Havas Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Britain, France, and Italy Warned Lithuania Against Abusing Rights in Memel</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon reported to the House of Commons today that Britain, France, and Italy have jointly warned Lithuania against abusing its rights in Memel. Simon stated, "The current state of Memel is not in accordance with the principles of autonomy, and therefore, we believe that Lithuania should immediately end this state of affairs." Recently, four members of the German National Socialist Party were sentenced to death in Memel for murdering a fellow party member who was about to reveal the party's plot to return Memel to Germany. German leader Hitler's attitude towards this case is very firm. It is said that he may demand that the Memel region hold a plebiscite like the Saar region. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>

After the establishment of compulsory military service, foreign troops will no longer be able to enter German territory at will. Moreover, the army's need for weapons and various military supplies will lead to increased production, bringing prosperity to Germany, and the conscription of young men will also create more positions for the unemployed.

<h3>International Commercial Telegraph; Special Commercial News from Reuters on April 2nd</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>The price of gold in London today was quoted at 144 shillings and one penny, a decrease of one shilling and seven and a half pence.</p>
<p>London Bullion: Yesterday's transaction price was lower than the quoted price by 1.5, not due to excessive selling, but due to a lack of buyers. Today, the price continued to fall due to weak buying interest. The spot price is 28 pence 25, and the futures price is 28 pence 375, both down 1875. China purchased and resold, and the closing sentiment was stable.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British vs. US London Foreign Exchange Market: This morning, the British pound was actively bought, but later it loosened slightly, and the price also fell back. The British-American exchange rate opened at $4.81625, higher than yesterday's US-British closing by 25. Within the first hour, the price rose by 1.0625 to $4.826875. At noon, it rose by 0.0625 to $4.8275. After that, the price turned downward. At 1 PM, it fell by 4375 to $4.823125. At 2 PM, it continued to fall by 4375 to $4.81875.</p>

<p>US vs. French: The opening price of the French exchange rate was $6.59625, higher than yesterday by 125.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>US Cotton: The New York cotton market opened higher today, especially for near-term old cotton, because the spot market is very firm. The government's new cotton policy is still unclear, so transactions are sluggish and the market sentiment is very unstable. If there is any new news, the market price will easily fluctuate up and down accordingly.</p>
<p>US Wheat: The Chicago wheat market opened stably this morning, with prices slightly higher, because the weather report is still unfavorable. The news that the Agricultural Adjustment Administration may continue to increase the acreage of spring wheat in the United States is seen by the public as a factor that favors the shortfall, but its impact has not yet occurred.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market is firmer today, especially for the near term. At 1 PM, the May futures price was 6.12, higher than yesterday by 7 pounds.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market: At 1 PM today, the May futures price was 5 shillings and 4 pence, up by 25.</p>

<p>New York: According to statistics from National City Bank, several companies' net profits last year were quite good. It is also heard that the Interstate Commerce Commission has allowed railway companies to increase freight rates. These are all news that are beneficial to the market, but apart from this, there is no important news, so the hope of more activity in the general market today cannot be realized. The stock market did not show excitement at the opening, and the prices did not differ much from yesterday's closing. However, utility stocks were bought slightly more than industrial stocks.</p>

<h3>The Shaan County Cotton Industry Relief Association Urges Relief for the Cotton Industry, Hopes that Factories Will Accept Domestic Cotton as Much as Possible, and Asks the Government to Increase the Tax on Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The Shaan County Cotton Industry Relief Committee believes that today, China's financial resources are exhausted, farmers and merchants are bankrupt, and poverty is widespread. This is especially true in the cotton industry, because the production in rural areas and the transportation by merchants are both dominated by cotton. Since the end of last winter, factories have refused to accept domestic cotton and have purchased American cotton as much as possible, causing foreign sales to expand suddenly and a large amount of silver to flow out of China. This kind of policy is tantamount to suicide. Therefore, they sent a telegram to the ministers of the National Government and the Cotton Control Association, urging them to increase the tax on imports as soon as possible to prevent foreign goods and strictly order factories to accept domestic cotton as much as possible to stop the leakage and cultivate the national foundation. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To the Ministers of the National Government: We believe that for thousands of years, China has been a country based on agriculture. All undertakings are built on the foundation of rural areas. Therefore, the safety and survival of China depends on the prosperity and decline of agriculture, and the prosperity and decline of agriculture depends on whether all sectors of the country jointly maintain it. Investigations in various places in the Northwest show that cotton is the main agricultural product. When the new cotton was put on the market last autumn, cotton merchants, in accordance with the principle of smooth circulation of goods and with the principle of low profits, competed to purchase and transport cotton to Shanghai for use by various spinning mills. At first, the factories accepted the cotton at a fair price, but seeing a large amount of cotton coming in, they suddenly changed their attitude and carried out manipulation in the name of financial emptiness, causing the domestic cotton transported to Shanghai to rot on the ground and become irreparable. In Shaan County alone, since last winter, cotton merchants have transported more than 10,000 tons to the sea, and less than 10% has been sold. There are still 18,000 tons that have been rejected and not sold. If we add up the stocks from all parties, the number will be even more alarming. If the factories stopped receiving raw materials due to financial constraints, there would be nothing to discuss. The most heartbreaking thing is that while rejecting domestic cotton, they are also wholeheartedly buying American cotton in large quantities and have repeatedly requested our government to reduce the import tax on American cotton. Their intention is to open up sales channels for foreigners and act as sales representatives. The impact of this is to directly destroy farmers and merchants and indirectly damage the national foundation. How can this be tolerated? We are thinking that in order to promote and increase cotton production, our government has a special Cotton Industry Control Committee, and in order to resist the American silver policy, it has long had a ban on preventing exports. However, the factories are blatantly disregarding this and risking disapproval, as if they are afraid that silver will not flow out in large quantities and that the country's vitality will not be deeply damaged. Such upside-down measures are nothing less than acting as accomplices for tigers. Moreover, cotton is a necessity for people's livelihood. If our country produces it and supplies it as much as possible, it will still not be enough. Now that farmers are already feeling the blow of having no way out for old cotton, the spring planting season is approaching. They will inevitably change to planting other crops. In the future, if there is a lack of cotton, we will have to rely on foreigners even more, then the outflow of silver and the national crisis will be a hundred times worse than today. If this continues for a long time and we do not take action early, we will perish before the imperialists destroy us. China belongs to the 400 million compatriots of China. How can we allow a small number of factories to be sacrificed to foreigners? We, the members of this association, are all citizens, and in accordance with the lesson that every man has a responsibility to save the country and seek survival, we dare not remain silent about the danger. Therefore, we dare to request, in the name of the association, that in addition to telegraping various banking groups to stop providing financial assistance to spinning mills for the purchase of foreign materials, we ask you to consider the situation below and immediately order various spinning mills to ban the purchase of foreign cotton and accept domestic cotton as much as possible. Also increase import taxes to stop the leakage, so that farmers and merchants can gradually recover, silver can stop exporting, and the country can turn from danger to safety. Our urgent words are incoherent. We hope that you will approve and follow our request. Chairman Wang Yunting, members Qu Wanshan, Su Dongchu, Wang Zhaonan, Xiong Zhifu, Gao Changli, Zhang Zixiang, Yuan Junmu, Wang Ziqian, Yang Ziduan, Zhang Yiheng, Yue Gancen, and Yang Qingting, all bow their heads."</p>
<h3>Wuhu-Tunxi Highway Displays Goods in Wuhu from April 1st to 7th</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In recent years, Anhui's highway construction has reached more than 3,000 li in the whole province, especially in southern Anhui, because the counties are rich in local resources and produce. Highway transportation is a unique tool for developing industry and commerce. The Su-Tun Road was originally a section of the Beijing-Guizhou trunk line, from Wuhu through Xuancheng, Sunjiabu, Ningguo, Jixi, Shexian, to Tunxi in Huizhou, with a length of 240 kilometers. It can be connected to the Beijing-Wuhu, Beijing-Jian, and Xuan-Chang roads to form a circular network and complete the transportation through the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. It has been open to traffic for several months. In the past, travelers relied on earth vehicles and sedan chairs to travel, taking months on the journey. Now, they can arrive in the evening after leaving in the morning. In order to make the public understand the relationship between highways and agriculture, industry, and commerce, and to improve the products along the line, the Anhui Provincial Government specially held the Wuhu-Tunxi Road Goods Mobile Exhibition to observe and compare and make improvements. The association is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony in Wuhu on April 1st. The venue is in the National Goods Company in front of the road. More than 1,000 kinds of agricultural, industrial, and unique products from various counties have been sent. After exhibiting in Wuhu for seven days, they will be transported to Xuancheng, Ningguo, and other places along the line for exhibition. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Types of Goods: Agricultural products are the most numerous exhibits, followed by industrial products. Among them, the timber of Ningguo, the inkstones of Jixi, the compasses, sundials and tea leaves of Xiuning, and the inkstones and brushes of Shexian are more valuable, and the quantity is also estimated to be the most. In addition, there are also a large number of labor works from schools in various counties, such as the bee boxes and dictionaries of Huizhou Girls' High School, and the rattanware of Wuhu Middle School. According to statistics, there are more than 130 items from Ningguo, more than 180 items from Xuancheng, more than 230 items from Jixi, 50 items from Xiuning, 100 items from Shexian, and more than 200 items from Wuhu. The beehives of Huizhou Girls' High School are made of glass, which is even more unique. Mineral resources are also very rich in this province. In addition to the Tiegang in Fanchang and the Tieshan iron sand mines in Dangtu, the non-ferrous metal minerals in Jixi and other counties are particularly abundant. Jingzhou, Huangbaishan, Mianzhou, Xiawu, Xichuan, and Luozhou in the four districts produce gold ore, crystals, white copper, brass, asbestos, anthracite, limestone, iron, etc. They have all been collected and sent to the exhibition. The Ministry of Industry once sent Gui Buju and Ma Junshi to survey and analyze them, and the results showed that their quality was very good.</p>
<p>Exhibition Schedule: The opening ceremony will be held in Wuhu on April 1st and will close on the 7th. The opening ceremony will be held in Xuancheng on the 10th and will close on the 14th. The opening ceremony will be held in Ningguo on the 17th and will close on the 20th. The opening ceremony will be held in Jixi on the 23rd and will close on the 27th. The opening ceremony will be held in Shexian on the 30th and will close on May 4th. The opening ceremony will be held in Tunxi on May 7th and will close on May 11th. All the exhibits are scheduled to be transported back to Wuhu on May 13th and then transported to Anqing, where the provincial government will organize a review committee to review them. The excellent ones will be given prizes and then returned to the respective counties. The transportation along the way will be arranged by Shu Gong, the director of the road management office, who will send vehicles to be responsible for the transportation. (April 1st)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Anhui Dredging: The Kui River Dispute Resolved; Commissioner of the Sixth District Reports on Handling; Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Guide Dredging Project</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: A dispute between the counties of Xiao and Su, Anhui, and Su County, Jiangsu, over the Kui River, was previously ordered by the Anhui Provincial Government to be resolved by the Administrative Inspector of the Sixth District and concurrently Magistrate of Si County, Lu Peizhang, who was dispatched to Xuzhou to discuss solutions with Commissioner Shao of Jiangsu Province. According to Lu's telegram reply, he stated that he went to Xuzhou on the first day of the lunar new year and consulted with Commissioner Shao on resolving both the current dispute and the permanent dispute. Regarding the resolution of the current dispute: (1) work on the Fenghuangdan (Phoenix Egg) gate should be stopped immediately; (2) Xiao County should be ordered to withdraw the security team occupying Du Laozhuang and Liang Xing Sunjia and other places in Su County, to prevent the expansion of the situation. As for resolving the permanent dispute, it must be handled in accordance with the survey drawings completed by the committee dispatched by the two provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui in the eighth year of the Republic (1919). The people of the four counties of Tong, Xiao, Su, and Ling have been arguing over this water conservancy project for hundreds of years, resulting in tragic incidents. If a fundamental solution is not sought now, it will ultimately lead to endless disasters for several counties. However, according to the report submitted by Magistrate Qu of Su County and Chang, commissioned by this office, the width and depth of the newly opened Fenghuangdan gate are about twice the size specified in the original survey drawings. If the downstream river depth is not increased by more than three times the original measurement, then in case of upstream floods, the water will inevitably overflow and flood, turning the downstream into a marshland. Since this project is vast, if Xiao, Ling and other counties do not provide some assistance, it will be difficult to see it completed within days. Jiangsu Province has expressed its approval for the two methods of treating the symptoms and the root causes proposed by the Commissioner, and has agreed to implement them. This can be considered a conclusion to this stage. All the people gathered at Baishan embankment have been ordered to disperse by the magistrates of Su and Su Counties, and local order has been restored. The Shitou Lake, the source of the Kui River, has been personally inspected. It is now planned to visit the Fenghuangdan gate and the river area in detail for unified planning. However, due to the urgency of the project, it is planned to borrow and allocate 5,000 yuan from the construction funds of Su and Su Counties in advance to meet urgent needs. At the same time, it is requested that construction personnel familiar with water conservancy be selected and sent to Su to provide guidance and solve any difficult construction problems at any time. It is cleverly planned to select construction technician and head of the water conservancy section, Wen Yi, to go and meet with Commissioner Lu to guide all the engineering affairs of Kui, and to report the handling situation for verification at any time (March 30th).</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Pronouncement of Sentences in Kidnapping Cases</h3>

<p>Shibu in the Fourth District is located on the shore of Taihu Lake. Yesterday, more than 60 refugees from Hunan arrived, traveling on two civilian boats from the Taihu Lake area. After docking, they went to the home of Zhang, a widow in Xiaojiawan, nearby. At first, they asked for food and drink, but seeing that Zhang was a vulnerable woman, they locked her in a room and carried out a search and robbery. They stole 30 silver dollars, more than 30,000 copper coins, two gold bracelets, three gold rings, and clothing, totaling more than 200 yuan in losses. In addition, the night boat of Kaiyang in Donglai Town also encountered a pirate boat with five or six bandits armed with weapons when it sailed to the entrance of Bashi Qiaobang in Yangbu Wei late last night. The boat owner and passengers were robbed of silver dollars, clothing, and other items, worth about 200 yuan.</p>

The station building was built decades ago and is extremely narrow, not suitable for use. Passengers often suffer from rain and sun exposure. The Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Railway Administration yesterday to rebuild Wuxi Station and add tea and snack rooms to facilitate travelers.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: The Construction Department Sends Personnel to Changzhou to Inspect Factories</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department believes that although the number of factories in various counties is increasing day by day, most of them are managed independently. It is necessary to inspect the organization of the factories to see if they are legal and whether their work is appropriate in accordance with the factory inspection implementation plan. Yesterday (1st), Inspector Cheng Qiyuan was specially sent to Changzhou to handle factory inspection matters. After Cheng arrived in Changzhou, he first went to the county government to make contact. The Third Section copied and sent the addresses and license numbers of the factories in the county. Cheng immediately began inspecting the factories.

He was immediately taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Changshu: The County Government Handles the Issue of Grain Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>This county suffered a severe drought last year, and the crops in various townships failed, causing great hardship for the farmers. In addition to organizing spring relief, the Zuoshan Grain Management Committee decided to implement grain price stabilization. Generally speaking, the cotton-growing areas in the eastern townships were the most severely affected by the disaster last year. This year's grain price stabilization should first be implemented in the fifth and sixth districts. The total amount of grain will be 4,396 shi of grain that will be shelled from the stored grain in the granary, and 10,000 yuan of disaster relief funds will be used. Jiang Ruiping, Gu Buqi, and Tang Chengsi were appointed to draft the outline and detailed rules for grain price stabilization, and it will be implemented after being submitted to the province for approval.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Strike Collectively</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang, the superintendent of the Revenue Department of Jiangsu Province, came to Changshu to investigate the business tax and planned to check the accounts of various merchants as a standard for increasing or decreasing the tax rate in the next year. When Commissioner Liu came to Changshu to investigate the rice industry, Wen Yaowen, the chairman of the industry association, invited many colleagues to meet with Commissioner Liu and requested a postponement of the audit, because many businesses could not maintain their operations and could not publish their accounts. Liu once agreed. Unexpectedly, Liu, accompanied by several members of the Business Tax Bureau, went to the area outside Dongnanmen on the 31st to conduct a random inspection of the accounts of rice shops. When checking the Taifeng Rice Shop on Nanwaitang An, the shopkeeper Zhang Xin was on his way to Shanghai due to business, leaving only one apprentice in the shop. He could not hand over the account books responsibly. As a result, a conflict occurred in the conversation. Liu ordered the shop to stop operating on the grounds that it obstructed the audit. The shop immediately obeyed the order and closed the door. The news spread to the industry at once, and they stopped operations one after another. An emergency meeting was convened at the Chamber of Commerce, and it was decided that all rice shops in the city would strike on the first day. A telegram was sent to the province requesting relief, and the situation was very serious. Even retailers did not sell retail.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: The Conflict between Soldiers and Workers Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>Dai Lingbao, a worker who was shot and killed, and Wan Jinru, a worker who was shot and injured, were working on dredging the Yili-Jintan Canal in Erling Town a few days ago, when they were shot by the Danyang escort team. For a time, public sentiment was surging, and it almost affected the progress of the project. Fortunately, the county magistrates of Jintan and Danyang, as well as Director Qiu of the Public Works Bureau and Chief Engineer Gu of Suofang, rushed to the town for a joint inspection. Tens of thousands of workers were watching. Most of the workers in Jintan had stopped working invisibly, waiting for a fair resolution. After investigating the truth of the accident, it was found that both sides had misunderstood, and the Danyang escort team's firing was reckless. In addition to providing a generous coffin for the deceased and providing compensation for the injured who were sent to the hospital for treatment, the Danyang County Government severely punished the murderers of the escort team to maintain order on the construction site and appease public anger. The order has now been restored, and work has resumed as usual.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Housing Tax Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the newly revised regulations on the collection of housing tax in Jiangsu Province were sent to the Provincial Government after being requested to be forwarded for a suspension by the Wuxi and other chambers of commerce in order to relieve the people's difficulties. Now, the Ministry of Finance has approved it with the letter number 4675, and has consulted the Provincial Government to temporarily postpone the event. The corresponding letter should be recorded and consulted, etc.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Dredging the Salt Canal for Work Relief</h3>
<p>Nantong suffered a severe drought last year. Local circles decided to dredge the salt canal for work relief. The work has now begun, but only 20,000 yuan has been raised out of the required 150,000 yuan. It has been decided to collect two months of shop rent to make up for the shortfall.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Build an Arts and Crafts Factory for Opium Offenders</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Opium Commission, in order to enable opium offenders sentenced to criminal penalties to learn skills during their sentences, first set up an arts and crafts factory for opium offenders in the Nantong area, entrusted to Commissioner Zheng for handling. The factory site has been identified in Xiaohai Town, and drawings have been prepared. Commissioner Zheng took them to Zhenjiang to discuss the progress.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: A Major Robbery Occurs in Yingjia Lane</h3>
<p>Zhang Shengyu's grocery store in Yingjia Lane, Ningbo, has been open for more than 30 years. The business is booming on weekdays, so there is a lot of savings, which has aroused the covetousness of bandits. At about 2 a.m. yesterday morning, shopkeeper Zhang Dechang was fast asleep when three bandits suddenly climbed over the wall near the back door, broke into the house through the window, and cut off the new and old telephone lines together. They broke into Dechang's bedroom, dragged Dechang out of bed, took out a pistol, and forced him to hand over the key to the safe. The bandits then looted the store. They stole 122 silver dollars, 138 banknotes, 3,068 jiao, three gold bracelets, a gold ring on Dechang's hand, and a jade inlaid ring on his wife's hand, totaling more than 1,000 yuan in losses. After receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau ordered its subordinates to strictly arrest the criminals and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Letter: Letter from the Affiliated Elementary School of Anhui Luzhou Normal School</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Shanghai Shenbao:</p>
<p>We respectfully write to inform you that we have read in the news column of your newspaper on March 16th that "the incident of Hu Zhaohui, principal of the Luzhou Normal School Affiliated Elementary School, assaulting and insulting female teachers has escalated," and we believe that it is based on inaccurate rumors. After investigation, it was found that female teachers Zhang Tian, ​​etc., of our Affiliated Elementary School had a misunderstanding due to dormitory issues, and there was no assault or insult. Principal Wang Jiayou of the Normal School held a meeting a few days ago to mediate the matter, and Xu Kangmin, a provincial school inspector, came to Feicheng for a review of the Boy Scouts and also convened all the teachers for a discussion, encouraging them to work together in the same boat and to prioritize the children's education, etc. The two sides have now reconciled, and there is no situation of the incident escalating. We earnestly request your newspaper to disclose the truth to clarify the facts. This would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully, The Affiliated Elementary School of Anhui Provincial Luzhou Normal School, March 27th.</p>

<h3>Various Organizations Issue Declaration Against Telephone Price Increase Yesterday; Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting Attends Public Utilities Committee; Explains Inconvenience of Per-Call Charging and Requests Serious Consideration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, Second Special District Citizens' Federation, National Goods Promotion Alliance, National Goods Factory Federation, Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, and other organizations, based on the resolution of the joint meeting of various organizations on March 30, have issued a declaration against the telephone price increase in addition to jointly writing to the Concession authorities. Since China has been affected by the global economic recession, rural areas have gone bankrupt and cities have seen industrial and commercial decline. Therefore, Shanghai, which has always been known for its prosperous market, has become an unprecedented depression since the opening of the port. Factory shutdowns and store closures are heard every day. At this time of economic depression in all industries, public utilities should reduce fees to lighten the burden on citizens and help restore prosperity. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Telephone Company has suddenly increased its prices under this extremely barren social economy. According to its price increase method, it is limited by the number of times the price increases progressively, which is extremely harsh. According to the telephone for general business purposes, the monthly calls should be around a thousand times. If it is progressively increased according to the proportion, the telephone fee will reach as much as forty or fifty yuan, which is more than double the current price. At this time of declining market conditions, all businesses are competing for meager profits. How can they bear this heavy burden? Even if the telephone is a public utility, it cannot be allowed to ask for anything it wants. The Telephone Company is only seeking to increase its own profits and disregards the public welfare of citizens, which is contrary to the purpose of public utilities. We still hope that the Concession authorities can take into account the rights and interests of residents in the boundary to use transportation tools and the relationship with social security, and take a stand of great impartiality to make a bold move to stop it. The actual performance is very different. Relying only on the company's one-sided arguments, and discarding the public opinion of the citizens, it accepted the request to change the fee schedule. When the news spread, everyone was surprised. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? The members of our associations are both long-term users of the company and taxpayers in the concession. They cannot remain silent about this kind of behavior that is contrary to public reason and violates public sentiment. In addition to jointly seriously questioning the Concession authorities and requesting a price reduction in accordance with the agreement, we also solemnly declare that we will resolutely oppose it. We hope that our taxpayer citizens and telephone users will rise up together to achieve this.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, after the Shanghai Telephone Company planned to change the fee method and calculate it according to the number of calls, the price increased a lot in general statistics. Various industries have expressed their opposition one after another. It has twice written to the Public Works Bureau to stop it and submitted a request to the municipal government to negotiate for cancellation. It is now heard that Yu Zuoting, the chairman of the association, accompanied by translator Xie Fusheng, attended the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Bureau at 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday to explain the inconvenience of charging per call and the opposition of merchants and residents throughout the city. The committee is asked to give serious consideration to this matter. It is heard that the Public Utilities Committee expressed its respect for Chairman Yu's views, and the method of charging by the number of calls may no longer be adopted.</p>
<h3>British Minister Arrives in Shanghai to Inspect Overseas Chinese Affairs and to Welcome His Sister; Will Stay for One Week and Then Return to Beijing</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, British Minister to China, Sir Miles Lampson, went south this time to meet with President Wang and Finance Minister Kong in Nanjing to discuss international loans to China. He stayed in Nanjing for more than ten days. He arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last and is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a week before returning to Nanjing to continue discussing the loan issue. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Accompanying Personnel</p>
<p>Mr. Lampson left Beijing on the 5 p.m. express train the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 p.m. He stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. Accompanying him were Secretary Cleghorn, Second Secretary of the Embassy Garcia, Military Attaché Harding, and attendant Massiel. Chinese Counselor Taikman stayed in Beijing for official business and did not accompany him. Mr. Lampson's wife and daughter also came along.</p>
<p>Mr. Lampson's Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Lampson went to the British Consulate General on the Bund yesterday morning to inspect and met with Consul General Bailey Nance until about 12 o'clock, inquiring about the details of overseas Chinese affairs in Shanghai. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited him specially. Mr. Lampson sent Secretary Garcia to meet with the reporter on his behalf. Regarding the international loan to China, he said that the minister had met with Foreign Minister Wang and Finance Minister Kong several times in Nanjing, but only made general discussions and had not yet reached a result, so it was necessary to continue discussing it.</p>
<p>One Week Stay in Shanghai</p>
<p>The minister is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a week before returning to Nanjing. It is reported that the minister will go to South China for inspection. The minister has no intention of doing so, because he had already gone south for inspection last year, so there is no need to do so again at present. Later, the reporter asked whether it was previously reported that Mr. Lampson would meet with Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi Akira in Shanghai to discuss international loans to China. He replied that the minister had just arrived in Shanghai in a hurry. Whether or not he would meet with the Japanese Ambassador during his stay in Shanghai had not yet been decided. If Ariyoshi came to visit, he would definitely meet and talk. Mr. Lampson's sister, Mrs. Scott, a former member of parliament, will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days, and Mr. Lampson came to welcome her.</p>
<p>Sumar Comes Along</p>
<p>Japanese Consul General to Nanjing, Suma, arrived in Shanghai on the same train as British Minister Lampson the night before last. According to Japanese sources, Consul General Suma had met with British Minister Sir Miles Lampson on the train when he came to Shanghai, so there seemed to be no need to meet again in Shanghai. As for the meeting between Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi Akira and the British Minister, according to Iwai of the Japanese Embassy, ​​Ariyoshi had no appointment to meet with the British Minister as of now. Consul General Suma arrived in Shanghai on the same train as the British Minister the night before last and will return to Beijing tonight.</p>
<h3>Petition for Relief for the Guantai Breach</h3>
<p>The Henan Relief Committee's Shanghai Office received an express telegram from Fengqiu County stating: "Zhang Goujian, Chairman of the Henan Relief Committee, greetings. The breach at Guantai on the Yellow River has Fengqiu bearing the brunt. The county's fourth and third-class districts are completely submerged, and villages in the first district are gradually being affected. We have repeatedly appealed through official correspondence, earnestly requesting the closure of the breach and the provision of relief. However, the Guantai breach closure project is deteriorating daily, and the Jiugulu gate in the lower reaches is also silting up, causing unfavorable discharge of the river, resulting in westward flooding and rampant currents. On the [illegible] day of this month, the water even reached Shizhai Xin [illegible] and other Shahe areas, three miles from the city. The flat ground is about six feet deep, and the water continues to rise. The people of the affected area are fleeing in droves, in a state of utter panic. As the disaster area expands, there is no end in sight. This concerns the well-being of the people, and we dare not withhold this information from you. In addition to urging the laborers to intensify the construction of dikes and dams to prevent any eventuality, and informing other parties by telegram, we are sending this special telegram to your committee for review, urging prompt closure of the breach and allocation of relief funds to save the lives of the people. The telegram is urgent and earnest. Yao Jiawang, County Magistrate of Fengqiu County, Henan, bows respectfully. Immediately.” The Henan Relief Committee has prepared a summary of the recent situation in the counties most severely affected by water and drought disasters, stating: "An investigation reveals that Hua, Feng, Kai, Chen, and Lan counties have suffered repeated breaches of the Yellow River, causing fields and houses to be almost entirely submerged. Many villages are surrounded by water. Furthermore, due to the breaching of the Hua Xiang dike in the Guantai Chaifang area of Lanfeng County, the southern second, fourth, and third districts of Fengqiu County were directly flooded, flowing north and merging into Hua through the breach at Menggang, Jiugulu, Changyuan, as well as dozens of villages in the Huanglingji area of the tenth district of Kaifeng County. Moreover, twenty-odd villages, including Miaozhai in the Hebei second district of the Lan (feng) Gui (de) County area, and ten-odd villages, including Dawangzhuang in the fourth district of Chenliu County, have suffered exceptionally heavy losses due to the sudden rise of the Yellow River. In January of this year, according to telegrams from the County Magistrate of Hua County and the Disaster Relief Association, the sand plains are wide, and the river is deep after the flood, making it difficult to restore agriculture. Unexpectedly, ice jams arrived suddenly, causing the water to rise steeply by three feet in two days, expanding the sand gullies and displacing the disaster victims. According to reports from Hua County, there are currently 170,000 disaster victims. Apart from those sheltered by soup kitchens and those requested to be relocated to neighboring counties for food, there are still 80,000 extremely poor people. It is proposed to relocate 3000-4000 of them to the Northwest for reclamation and to allocate a large amount of relief funds for assistance. Furthermore, according to two telegrams from the County Magistrate of Fengqiu County, the river water rose steeply by five feet on December [illegible] of last year and January [illegible] of this year. After two days, it rose again without stopping. The disaster area has expanded, and the disaster victims are trapped in the water, crying out for help. Moreover, on January 2nd, a telegram was received from Kong Xiangrong, Committee Member of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association and Director of the Work Relief Team, stating that the river water had risen sharply in more than ten villages, including Lao Lizhuang, under the jurisdiction of Kaifeng County, and in the area of the tenth district, flooding into the villages. The disaster victims were stripping bark from trees to satisfy their hunger, and it was requested that efforts be made to provide assistance and emergency relief. An investigation also reveals that in the special zone, the counties of Shangcheng, Jingfu, Bin (chuan), Gushi, Guangshan, and Luoshan have suffered from successive years of communist banditry, leading to the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Although the bandits have somewhat subsided, natural disasters have struck frequently, with water and drought occurring one after another, resulting in an increasingly severe famine. Shangcheng has been affected by drought, with an area of over 450 square li and a loss of over 500,000 shi of crops, affecting over 230,000 disaster victims. Jingfu has been affected by drought, with an area of over 1030 square li and a loss of over 50,000 shi of rice, affecting over 28,000 people. Hanchuan has been flooded, with an area of 510,000 li, affecting over 6300 people. Gushi has suffered from both water and drought disasters, resulting in losses of over 50,000 silver dollars and over 800,000 shi of grain, affecting over 370,000 people. In the Nanxiangdian area of the seventh district of Guangshan, the communist bandits have been harassing the area, causing significant losses. It has also suffered from drought. After the drought in Luoshan, it was again harassed and occupied by the bandit leader Ma Ruiwu, who ravaged almost the entire county, causing the disappearance of over 1400 people and an estimated loss of property worth 120,000 dollars. The disaster victims are in a dire situation, with no guarantee for the next day."</p>

<h3>Rescuing Industry and Commerce, Three Major Banks Form a Syndicate, Providing Loans to Industries and Businesses for Circulation, Ministry of Finance is Also Planning Fundamental Relief Measures</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that, regarding the matter of rescuing the declining industry and commerce, the Ministry of Finance has issued 100 million yuan of the 24th-year Financial Bonds to first replenish the capital of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications for implementation. As for how the Central Bank and the other three banks will proceed with the rescue of industry and commerce after their capital is replenished, the Central News Agency reporter has explored the situation with financial circles in this city as follows:</p>
<p>Remaining Bonds, Retained by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is increasing the capital of the Central Bank and other banks, with 30 million yuan for the Central Bank, 15 million yuan for the Bank of China, and 10 million yuan for the Bank of Communications. The Bank of China originally had 25 million yuan but was subsequently approved by the bank's board of directors to reduce it to 15 million yuan. As for the remaining 45 million yuan of the Financial Bonds, it has been decided to retain them in the Ministry of Finance. As the original issuance of these bonds was to replenish the capital of the Central Bank and other three banks to rescue the decline of industry and commerce, it has been decided not to mortgage the remaining bonds for loans from the outside world.</p>
<p>Three Major Banks, Forming a Syndicate</p>
<p>After the capital of the Central Bank and other three banks is increased, they will immediately proceed with the rescue of industry and commerce. After the Bank of Communications' shareholders' meeting is held, the authorities of the three banks will gather to discuss everything. According to banking circles, the Central Bank and the other three banks have decided to form a syndicate in the shortest possible time to provide mortgages for industry and commerce. In recent years, the decline of industry and commerce has become increasingly severe, and economic difficulties have reached their extreme. Loans are urgently needed for circulation. Therefore, the organization of the three banks' loan syndicate is truly an urgent matter.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Planning, Fundamental Relief</p>
<p>Rescuing industry and commerce through loans can only provide temporary relief. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has decided to plan fundamental relief measures. Financial circles believe that the abolition of the transit tax and the reduction of the export tax are essential for the fundamental rescue of the decline of industry and commerce. It is said that the Ministry of Finance authorities are paying close attention to this and may realize it within the possible scope. At the same time, the government's encouragement of industrial production, as well as the investigation of industrial output and sales figures, must be controlled, so that the endangered industry and commerce can have hope of recovery.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency report states that yesterday, the International Trade Bureau [stated that] the Nanyang Islands have a vast area, a mild climate, and abundant products. Millions of overseas Chinese operate there. Therefore, China occupies a considerable position in Nanyang trade. In recent years, the fierce commercial competition has had a profound impact on export trade. To save and develop it, samples of domestic goods should be transported for display so that overseas Chinese merchants can understand the exquisite nature of domestic goods and develop the concept of loving domestic goods. The bureau recently received a letter from the Nanyang Dutch-owned Manado Chinese Chamber of Commerce Goods Exhibition Hall, indicating the salable items there, such as: paints, silk fabrics, gold and silver threads, tooth powder, toothpaste, cotton fabrics, children's toys, shoe polish and leather oil, wool fabrics, seasonings, needles, linen fabrics, umbrellas, scissors, lace, flashlights, porcelain, wool yarn, thermos bottles, enamelware, handkerchiefs, mosquito coils, glasses, combs, rubber shoes, clocks, ties, cosmetics, watches, socks. If overseas Chinese merchants want to purchase after seeing the samples, the association can be responsible for introductions. Manufacturers who wish to send samples for display should contact the bureau's Guidance Department. In addition, the bureau's Guidance Department has received many letters from various countries requesting domestically produced goods. They are now published one by one below, hoping that each exporter will inform the bureau so that it can introduce them. (1) The Mexican Canelils Company needs 1,000 kilograms of wax cakes (Shellacgundryinfabes). The goods are packed in wooden boxes, each weighing 200 kilograms, and inquiries about the price (CIFManzanilloMexico).

The original petition is excerpted as follows: The aerated water stamp tax is cumbersome and complicated, and it is not in accordance with the tax law. We sincerely request that it be clearly abolished and the collection be stopped in order to alleviate commercial difficulties and maintain people's livelihood. According to a letter from Yili Aerated Water Company, a factory member of the association, stamp tax is a kind of certificate tax, so its scope of application only belongs to contracts, books, and all personnel certificates used in business, which is completely different from the nature of commodity tax. However, since the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, foreign wine, OK Cola, aerated water, and firecrackers were all subject to special stamp tax as commodities, which is unreasonable in terms of legal principles. Therefore, after its implementation, the foreign wine item was changed to be collected by the Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau, and the OK Cola and firecracker items were stopped before they were implemented. Later, the cosmetic stamp tax was also abolished due to many disputes. It can be seen that collecting stamp tax on goods is not only contrary to legal principles, but also has many difficulties in practice. Aerated water is also a kind of commodity, and the situation is the same. Since the stamp tax was levied in 1928, except for one year of suspension in the middle, it is still collected as usual. Among the same commodities, all other stamp taxes have been abolished, but only the aerated water stamp tax remains, which is unfair. Moreover, aerated water is one of the summer refreshments, and its nature is exactly the same as orange juice and fruits sold on the market. There are many other similar cold drinks and foods, with many varieties and high prices, but there is no mention of collecting stamp tax on them. Why is only aerated water not exempt? This is unfair in terms of law and reason, and it should be abolished quickly. It is also found that the aerated water stamp tax can only be collected in the Chinese area, not in the concessions. Therefore, on the same road, one side has tax and the other side has no tax, which makes people feel that sovereignty is being undermined. Moreover, people do not know the situation, and they are often punished when they buy aerated water in the concession and carry it to the Chinese area, which causes frequent disputes. This has a negative impact on national sovereignty and people's psychology, and it should be abolished quickly. In the past, aerated water stamps were cumbersome to handle and inconvenient to affix in advance. According to the tax payment procedure, stamps should be affixed at the time of sale. Therefore, the tax bureau directly collects taxes from the selling merchants. That is, aerated water transported to other places is only affixed with stamps when it is sold after arrival. The merchants who sell aerated water are all small businesses, and there are also poor people who set up stalls to sell and make a small profit to make a living. These people are ignorant and do not understand the tax law. If there is any mistake, they will be severely punished. Moreover, aerated water is mostly packaged in glass bottles. Even if the stamps are affixed completely, they are easy to fall off once they come into contact with water, and the tax bureau inspectors are picky. If they are found, they will still be punished according to the regulations. If they do not have money to pay the fine, the aerated water will be confiscated, and they will not only lose their capital but also have to compensate for the price of the bottles. Therefore, every summer, we often see these poor stallholders crying and begging at the gate of the tax bureau. This is of great importance to the livelihood of small people, and it should be abolished quickly. The above are just a few of the most obvious points. Other than that, there are many malpractices caused by affixing stamps, disputes caused by inspections, and various trivial matters that are difficult to describe in detail. The purpose of the country's taxation is to enrich the national treasury. However, the statistics of this aerated water stamp tax show that the annual income is only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. After deducting the office expenses, the actual amount received is very small. It does not help the national treasury, but only increases the people's resentment. The gains and losses are obvious. Moreover, the new stamp tax law passed by the Legislative Yuan, as reported in the news, does not include the aerated water item in its clauses, which shows that this tax is not in line with the principles of stamp tax. At this time, the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in various provinces have been abolished, and the aerated water stamp tax should be abolished uniformly. Moreover, Yili aerated water is purely a Chinese merchant product, and our government should vigorously guide and promote domestic products and develop the country's industry. Therefore, we specially write this document to express our sincerity and earnestly request your association to support domestic products and safeguard industry, and to submit a report to the Ministry of Finance to understand the situation and approve the clear abolition of the aerated water stamp tax and stop the collection of taxes in order to reduce the burden, etc. After investigation, the aerated water stamp tax causes hardship for merchants and disturbs the people. The traces seem to be harsh levies, which are contrary to the national product one-item-one-tax system. Moreover, the treatment of Chinese and foreign is unequal, which damages national sovereignty. We hereby approve the previous situation and verify that it is consistent with the facts. We should submit a report to your department to review and approve. We earnestly request that you consider the situation and quickly grant the clear abolition of the aerated water stamp tax and stop the collection of taxes, which will not cause much damage to the national treasury, but will bring endless happiness to merchants and the people. At this time, the government is safeguarding domestic products and improving the tax system. We request that you approve our request in order to alleviate commercial difficulties and benefit the people's livelihood, etc.</p>
<h3>### Lawyers Lou and Xu Ask the French Consul to Release Li Mingyu Because Li Was Naturalized as a Chinese Citizen More Than Ten Years Ago, and the Naturalization Certificate Was Searched Away on That Day</h3>
<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, regarding the case of Korean Choi Young-shim (i.e., Li Mingyu) being arrested by the French Police Department, his family has entrusted lawyers Lou Yunmei and Xu Jie to negotiate. Yesterday, the two lawyers sent a letter to French Consul Baoliong, saying that Choi Young-shim, a Korean citizen of your country, i.e., Li Mingyu, was arrested by the Shanghai Xuhuali Road Police Department established by your country at Laoshen on the morning of the 26th of last month at 7 o'clock. After being entrusted by Choi Young-shim's wife, our lawyers negotiated with the chief patrol, but failed. Yesterday, we met with your consul and were told that you were not aware of the case beforehand and had not issued an arrest warrant. If he has indeed been naturalized as a Chinese citizen, he should be dealt with according to the law. In that case, the police department arrested our citizens without the permission of the responsible official department of the national communication, which is inappropriate. According to the agreement on the establishment of the Chinese court in the French Concession of Shanghai, regardless of whether there is any suspicion of crime, he should be handed over to the Chinese court for trial. According to Choi Young-shim's naturalization as a citizen of our country, it was on June 13th of the Republic of China, more than ten years ago, and the naturalization certificate was searched away on that day. Our lawyers deeply regret this behavior in terms of your country's communication with our country. Since your consul has agreed to investigate and deal with it according to the law, we hope that you will transfer Choi Young-shim from the Xuhuali Road Police Department, retrieve the case files, review the searched naturalization certificate, and release him. Our lawyers sincerely hope that your consul will maintain the dignity and authority for this case. Sincerely, Lou Yunmei, member of the Shanghai Bar Association of the Republic of China, Lawyer Xu Jie. To the French Consul in Shanghai, Baoliong.</p>
<h3>### The Pharmaceutical Industry Association Asks for a Refund of the Industrial Alcohol Unified Tax</h3>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Factory Industry Association of this city believes that the alcohol unified tax is related to the cost of domestic industrial goods. Yesterday, they specially submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a refund in accordance with the regulations in order to maintain industry. The document said, (the above is omitted) Alcohol is a necessary raw material for industry, and it is also a military chemical product for national defense. The manufacture of yeast and military hygiene materials also uses alcohol as a raw material. Since the government levied an ordinary unified tax of 1.3 cents per liter and a modified unified tax of 6.5 cents per liter, the price has risen sharply, and the cost of various industrial products has also increased accordingly. Industrial enterprises first pay attention to cost. In addition, foreign goods are fiercely dumped into China, and the import surplus index is increasing year by year. The government authorities should find ways to reduce the cost of domestic industrial goods so that they can compete with foreign goods with strength to save the economic crisis. Since the government levied the alcohol unified tax, it has not increased tariffs on finished products imported with alcohol as raw materials, such as cosmetics, artificial silk, and new pharmaceuticals, or levied a tax equivalent to the alcohol unified tax. This is tantamount to guiding the source of foreign goods dumping and curbing the vitality of domestic industrial goods. However, everyone knows that the national treasury is in deficit, and the people should do their best to pay taxes if the government's tax revenue does not violate the principles of the national economy. The alcohol unified tax has also been implemented in countries such as Japan, but the government of that country refunds the unified tax on alcohol used as industrial raw materials in accordance with the regulations. This is a way to take both tax revenue from the national treasury into account and benefit domestic industrial goods. This is the way to do good. We hereby submit a document to your department requesting that you approve the industrial raw materials used for alcohol to be refunded the unified tax in accordance with the established regulations of other countries in order to benefit industry and commerce and maintain industry.</p>
<h3>### Dongya Cooperates with Xianghe: Solid Formation of the Wool Weaving Industry</h3>
<p>Our country's industry is becoming more and more advanced, and various factories are also increasing day by day. In this way, the use of funds can be said to be on the right track, but due to the different business methods, some are thriving, and some are failing midway. Looking at our country's wool weaving industry, it is the most needed at present, but this kind of factory is still rare. Although there are already several, they are as rare as morning stars. It is said that there are only two wool yarn factories, Tianjin Dongya Woolen Textile Company and the former Tianjin Xianghe Wool Spinning Factory.</p>
<p>Tianjin Xianghe Wool Spinning Factory began to plan to open in 1934. With limited capital, it established a factory in the French Concession of Tianjin. The Feiji brand wool yarn produced was not bad. However, due to its lack of business methods, its inability to improve the quality of goods, and its weakness in talent and capital, it was unable to compete with foreign countries and eventually could not support it. It stopped operating this spring. It specially requested its peer, Tianjin Dongya Woolen Textile Co., Ltd., to negotiate a merger. After the change was approved, the Tianjin Dongya factory funded and purchased all of Xianghe's original assets and renamed it the First Branch of Tianjin Dongya Woolen Textile Co., Ltd. The procedures have now been completed, and the takeover was officially completed a few days ago.</p>
<p>Tianjin Dongya Woolen Textile Co., Ltd. is the largest and only wool yarn factory in China. Its founders, Mr. Song, etc., have been engaged in the wool weaving industry for many years. Mr. Song studied in Europe and the West three times and specialized in wool weaving and served in famous wool weaving factories abroad for many years. Not only does he have a deep understanding of wool weaving knowledge, but he also has a deep understanding and experience in wool weaving business and the purchase of machinery. He has had the ambition to revitalize our country's wool weaving industry for 20 years. He has tried to run it several times in Jinan and other places, but all failed. The setbacks he has suffered and the difficulties he has gone through can be said to be meticulous. After he had a solid grasp of it, he continued to work hard. In 1932, he opened the factory in Tianjin, and in early 1933, it officially started full operation. Its products are the Dihuyang brand wool yarn, which is purely domestic. Because the factory has many talented people, each with specialized knowledge, united and working tirelessly, with the assistance of patriotic comrades from all over the country and the guidance of the government, it has been able to sell all over the country in the shortest possible time. Its reputation is known both north and south, and it can be called the strong enemy of imported goods. The exquisiteness of its products has not only won the praise and sympathy of the Chinese people, but also completely shaken and gradually retreated from the Chinese market that was originally occupied by foreign goods.</p>
<p>This cooperation between Dongya and Xianghe, in other words, is the expansion of Dongya's internal factory. First, the establishment of Xianghe added an arm to our wool weaving industry. Unfortunately, it failed midway. The current cooperation does not reduce its strength slightly, or it may be increased. This large-scale factory is what our country needs most at present. Therefore, its importance in the future should be further expanded and promoted. I hope that this kind of factory can gradually increase in number in order to save rights and interests. However, at the moment when foreign goods are widely distributed and sold, and various designs are used to attract the purchasing psychology of the Chinese people in our inland areas, and they are willing to spend money and transport money abroad without realizing it, the opening of various factories in our country should also be carefully carried out. Without practical experience, pure knowledge, noble vision, and strong capital, and with careful arrangements in all aspects, so that there is no guarantee that it cannot be easily frustrated, it cannot be started. In this way, or with the assistance of the government and the promotion of people from all walks of life, it is necessary to have the special ability to compete fiercely with foreign goods and exist by chance. It is absolutely impossible to blindly follow the trend due to temporary excitement or to see temporary small profits, regardless of all the harms, which will only waste money, not only cause great losses, but also harm the same industry and be ridiculed by foreigners. The cooperation between the "Dongya" and "Xianghe" factories has a solid foundation. It is hoped that they will work hard to manage it, and it will not be difficult to take the lead in the wool weaving industry.</p>

<h3>### Opposing the Fee Increase by Pig Dealers: The Fresh Meat Industry Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday, Vowing to Achieve the Goal of Cancellation, Otherwise Refusing to Trade</h3>
<p>More than 1,000 fresh meat businesses in the Shanghai Public Concession have been in dispute due to opposition to the extra fees charged by pig dealers in Wusong. The Fresh Pig Dealers Association and the Fresh Meat Association specially convened a meeting of both parties for mediation at the Gurentang Association Hall in the South City on the 30th of last month, but the result was unresolved due to the insistence of the Wusong pig dealers. Each fresh meat shop specially convened an emergency meeting at 2 pm yesterday to discuss countermeasures. More than 500 representatives from Laoqingfeng, Yida, Youji, Chengji, and other shops, including Xu Jinsheng, Chen Longhu, Huang Qixun, Huang Zhongqi, Yang Yinyou, and Huang Wenhua, elected Chen Longhu as chairman. After he reported on the mediation process of the association, the following discussions were held: (1) The negotiations between the associations reduced the opposition to the corner handling fee to four points, but the Wusong side did not accept it at all. How should we express our case? It was decided that unless the goal of canceling the number is fully achieved, all transactions will be refused. (2) (3) Mr. Fan Deyu, a senior figure in the meat industry, sent a letter of comfort. How should we express our case? It was decided that we would accept it within the possible scope. The meeting was adjourned, and it was also heard that the fresh meat industry in the South City and the French Concession will also respond unanimously, and the trend is expanding.</p>

<h3>Today's Ceremony: The First Group Wedding; Rehearsal Wedding Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The first group wedding of the New Life Movement is scheduled to take place today at 3 PM in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium. Fifty-seven couples will participate, with Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya officiating. A rehearsal was held yesterday at 3 PM to ensure familiarity with the ceremony. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Today's Ceremony</p>
<p>The first group wedding is scheduled for 3 PM this afternoon in the Municipal Government Auditorium. At that time, 57 couples will participate with their matchmakers (i.e., parents). Mayor Wu and Director Wu will officiate. All marriage certificates have been pre-stamped. The officiants have also prepared a souvenir made of pure silver in the shape of the Tai Chi circle, inscribed with the words "New Life Movement Group Wedding," and inlaid with the national flower, which will be presented to the newlyweds in a red velvet box as a memento.</p>
<p>Auditorium Decoration</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Auditorium has been specially decorated. Below the platform is the designated area where the newlyweds will gather after completing the ceremony, covered with a red carpet and marked with numbers, surrounded by red ribbons. Beside this is the area where the newlyweds will stand and wait to perform the ceremony. Next to that is the seating area for the presiding officials. To the left is the orchestra. Beyond that are the audience seats. The platform and stairs are decorated with fresh flowers. In the center is a bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen, flanked by crossed flags of the Party and the nation. On the table in front of the statue are the marriage certificates and souvenirs.</p>
<p>Wedding Ceremony</p>
<p>Over 700 tickets to view the wedding ceremony have been issued, as the auditorium can only accommodate this number. At the beginning of the ceremony, Master of Ceremonies Wang Xianqing from the Social Affairs Bureau will introduce the couples, who will be led onto the platform via a small staircase to perform the ceremony. The officiants and all staff will wear blue robes and black mandarin jackets. In addition to the prescribed attire, the newlyweds will wear badges on their chests with the words "New Life Movement Group Wedding" in gold lettering on a red background, with an emblem above indicating the group wedding and individual numbers. The wedding ceremony will consist of: (1) The officiant takes the stage; (2) The matchmakers/introducers take their places; (3) The newlyweds enter the auditorium; (4) The orchestra plays music; (5) The newlyweds stand in their designated positions; (6) The Party anthem is sung; (7) The Master of Ceremonies calls out the names; (8) The newlyweds go on stage to perform the ceremony; (9) The officiant presents the certificates and gifts; (10) Thanking the officiant; (11) Mayor's address; (12) Director's address; (13) Music is played; (14) The ceremony concludes. The Mayor also instructed that the women must all wear white gloves and ensure that their hair is not disheveled, to present a dignified appearance.</p>
<p>Mayor's Address</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng will deliver an address at the time. The original text is as follows: It is said that the relationship between husband and wife is the beginning of human relationships, and the family is the origin of society. Therefore, the law strictly regulates matchmakers, and etiquette dictates the exchange of betrothal gifts. These were the established rules of the past and are still valued. In recent times, as the world has become more interconnected and customs have changed, the old rituals and music no longer fully satisfy modern sensibilities. A new system is needed to establish customs and transform the people. This is why the city is undertaking this group wedding initiative, a responsibility that local officials cannot shirk. Today, at this first ceremony, 114 individuals are participating, and the Mayor and the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau will officiate. We value the harmony of the marital chamber, its contribution to the nation, and the health of its descendants, who will become pillars of society. May all of you newlyweds strive together toward this goal. April 3rd, 24th year of the Republic of China, Mayor Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<p>Rehearsal Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3 PM, to ensure the smooth execution of the first group wedding, a rehearsal was held in advance. Mayor Wu, Director Wu, and the organizing staff were all present to provide guidance and make arrangements, looking energetic. In particular, many people came to observe, and the Public Security Bureau dispatched police to maintain traffic. It was specified that only the newlyweds could enter through the main entrance of the Municipal Government building, while others should enter and exit through the back door. Except for three couples (18, 42, and 54) who had not yet received their attire, all newlyweds participated.</p>
<p>Rehearsal Details</p>
<p>First, they changed clothes downstairs. At 3 PM sharp, they all ascended the stairs to the auditorium, led by Zhang Binghui, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, and his wife Chen Guowei, who directed the men and women to stand separately. Then, Master of Ceremonies Wang Xianqing called out their names to ascend the stage. First, they bowed three times to the portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the Party and national flags, then bowed twice to each other, and then bowed once to the officiant. The officiant presented the certificates and souvenirs, and the couples bowed once to thank the officiant, then descended, hand in hand. After 20 couples had rehearsed, they all gathered to recite the address. Finally, the newlyweds took a group photo in front of the Municipal Government building. The rehearsal concluded at 5 PM.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is a great honor for Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau and myself to preside over the first group wedding ceremony in Shanghai. Since the Chinese Revolution, many old rituals have become incompatible with the spirit of the times and are no longer applicable. We have not yet fully established new rituals, so social customs related to weddings, funerals, and celebrations lack definite rules, resulting in a chaotic state. However, Chinese rituals are too cumbersome. Weddings, funerals, and celebrations are unavoidable events in life, so we often spend a lot of money and time on them. Some people even spend their entire life savings on these important life events. Therefore, the rituals are not only cumbersome but also uneconomical. The Municipal Government, recognizing this, is promoting group weddings. Group weddings have three main purposes: first, simplicity; second, economy; and third, solemnity. Among these, solemnity is the most important because any ritual, whether simple or complex, must be solemn. If a ceremony is not solemn, it will not be a ceremony. Therefore, we hope that when holding group wedding ceremonies, not only the newlyweds should know the importance of the ceremony and maintain its solemnity, but also the guests must abide by the rules of the auditorium and maintain order, so that the trend of group weddings can start from here, gradually become widespread, and improve our old rituals. The reason we are holding a rehearsal today is that group weddings are innovative in China and a first in Shanghai. Not only do the newlyweds lack this new experience, but also the officiants and staff lack experience. Therefore, to ensure the solemnity and grandeur of the ceremony, we have to rehearse a day in advance. The rehearsal went well overall, but there are a few things that need to be corrected. We hope that the newlyweds will pay attention to these corrections. In short, we must abide by the rules and order of the auditorium and maintain the solemnity and grandeur of the wedding.</p>
<p>Excitement of the Audience</p>
<p>People from all walks of life were excited to observe this innovative initiative of the New Life Movement wedding. Mayor Wu and all the staff provided patient guidance. The Mayor instructed that bows should be made at 45 degrees and demonstrated the correct posture for holding hands and stepping down. He and Yu Hongjun personally practiced to serve as examples. He also gave a brief speech, saying that since the Chinese Revolution, all unsuitable old systems should be reformed, and the New Life Movement group wedding is a way to reform cumbersome rituals. The key points are three: (1) Simplicity; (2) Economy; (3) Solemnity. In addition to saving time and money, we should emphasize solemnity to value the spiritual aspect. This is a rehearsal, and I hope everyone approaches it with a spirit of learning and practice.</p>
<p>Welcoming the Newlyweds</p>
<p>This afternoon, the Municipal Government will still use cars to welcome the newlyweds at the intersection of the Great World and Binshan Road. The traffic in the city center will be maintained by the Public Security Bureau's branch office there, and viewers will be directed to enter through the back door. After the ceremony, Mayor Wu and Director Wu will host a tea and refreshments reception in the Municipal Government dining hall.</p>

<h3>New Life Movement Committee of This City Manufactures: Colorful Metal Slogans; Suitable for Public Venues, Trams, and Automobiles; Organizations Can Send Representatives with Letters to Collect Them</h3>
<p>To promote the New Life Movement, the New Life Movement Promotion Committee of this city has not only organized youth service groups and police advisory teams, but has also erected large neon light slogans in front of the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower, which illuminate every night and are quite eye-catching. It has also printed a large number of slogans, which can be seen everywhere in various organizations, groups, and public places throughout the city. The committee found that the paper slogans are easily damaged and uneconomical. To seek permanent effectiveness, it specially commissioned artists to design various colorful metal slogans, which have recently been fully manufactured and are intended for use in various organizations, groups, schools, public venues, military vehicles, and public buses. The printing is very exquisite, the designs are particularly magnificent, and the colors are bright. When nailed to walls, they are very eye-catching. If various organizations, groups, schools, tram companies, and public bus companies in this city need these slogans, they can officially send representatives with letters to collect them from the committee inside the Fenglin Bridge City Party Headquarters. The slogans are listed below: (1) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the four pillars of a nation. If the four pillars are established, the nation can be restored." (2) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "The New Life Movement requires understanding propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame; taking responsibility; obeying discipline; valuing cleanliness; and being punctual." (3) If everyone practices the New Life, the nation will be full of vigor. (4) Labor, health, order, and cleanliness are the sources of happiness. (5) Going out early and returning early is beneficial and harmless. (6) Seats should be given to the elderly, weak, women, and children. (7) Abstaining from tobacco and alcohol is the way to a healthy life. (8) Dress neatly, be polite, and obey the law.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Dongyouheng Road; Pursuer Shot and Injured; Robbers Vanish Without a Trace; Police Car Runs Over a Child</h3>
<p>At around 7 PM last night, two robbers suddenly entered the home of a Mr. So-and-so at No. 28 Qing'an Lane on Dongyouheng Road. One robber was armed with a pistol. After entering the house, they shouted at everyone inside to remain silent and demanded the keys to the chests, which they proceeded to search. After about 20 minutes, they had robbed more than 100 yuan. As the robbers, seeing their objective achieved, were about to leave, they were discovered by a co-resident, who hurriedly shouted "Catch the robbers!" from the balcony. Upon hearing this, the robbers fled in a panic. At that moment, Cai Maoyuan, a 30-year-old man from Yangzhou who lived next door at No. 30, was sitting idly at home. Hearing the alarm, he looked out and saw the robbers running towards the entrance of the lane. He hurriedly gave chase. But the robbers noticed him. As he chased them to Zhoujiazui, the desperate robbers turned around and fired a shot, hitting him in the left eye and exiting through the left ear. He fell to the ground, injured on the spot. As a result, the robbers still managed to escape. By the time the police car arrived, they had vanished without a trace. Cai Maoyuan was taken to the hospital for treatment, while the police hunted for the escaped robbers. It was also learned that a child had been injured by the police car rushing to the scene upon receiving the alarm and had been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Labor Daycare Center Officially Offers Nighttime Childcare; Limited to Ten Children; Monthly Fee of Eight Yuan</h3>
<p>The Labor Daycare Center near Panfang on Penglai Road in the Nanshi area has been operating with great success since its opening. Currently, the daycare center has more than 30 children, all of whom are quite healthy and lively, which has greatly reduced the burden on the working class. According to Ms. Zhu of the daycare center, who spoke to a reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency, since various sectors requested the establishment of nighttime childcare, she immediately devoted her efforts to planning it, and it officially began operations a few days ago. However, due to limited space, it can only accommodate ten children at present. One child has already been enrolled yesterday. As for the fees, the monthly fee for daytime childcare is two yuan, and the monthly fee for nighttime childcare is eight yuan. Therefore, she expects that the number of children enrolled in nighttime childcare will not be as high as that in daytime childcare.</p>
<h3>American Sailor Beats Chinese Man to Death; Drunk and Swaying Arm-in-Arm with a Dancer, He Punched Without Reason; What Crime Did the Chinese Man Commit to Suffer Such a Tragic Death?</h3>
<p>At 9:45 PM on the first day of this month, a simply dressed man resembling a worker, about 35 or 36 years old, was walking south on Rue de la Cathédrale in the French Concession. When he reached the side of the road opposite number 138 on that street, an American sailor named Mirate Kosk (transliteration), drunk and swaying arm-in-arm with a Russian dancer, was staggering in the same direction as the man. As he approached the man, the sailor suddenly, without any reason, punched the man hard in the face, causing him to be injured, his nose to bleed, and him to become dizzy and unsteady. He fell to the ground. The sailor then kicked the man's buttocks before walking away. At that time, Zhang Liang'en, Detective No. 364 from the Political Department of the French Police, and Wang Jingwu, a clerk residing at No. 155 Rue Pointeuse, as well as Zhou Ajin, a Huapu watchman from Yancheng at No. 285 of the company house at No. 134, all witnessed the sailor beating the man to the ground. They felt indignant and blew their whistles to summon the Huapu and Annamese patrolmen, including No. 600, who were stationed and patrolling nearby, and told them what had happened. The patrolmen then caught up with the American sailor and the Russian woman and took them to the Lujiawan Police Station. Meanwhile, the police station sent a detective to take the man to Guangci Hospital. Because he was injured and unconscious, he could not speak and his name and address were unknown. Because he had suffered severe brain trauma, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 10:50 PM that night. The hospital notified the police station, and yesterday morning, the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan funeral parlor for a post-mortem examination. The witnesses Zhang Liang'en, Wang Jingwu, Zhou Ajin, and others were summoned to the scene and reported to the Special Second Court Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Wang Ren, Forensic Doctor Jiang Jun, and Clerk Zhao Yifen arrived at the funeral parlor at noon to examine the body. After questioning the three witnesses about the American sailor's actions, the official also took a report from the Bao Tan investigator. Wang Jun declared that the examination confirmed that the unnamed man had died from a brain injury caused by being beaten. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan for burial, and the suspect was handed over by the police to the competent authorities for legal action. After the examination, it was also heard from witnesses that the defendants had stated at the police station that the deceased had groped the Russian woman's breasts, and the sailor, seeing this and being jealous, had attacked him, leading to the incident. The truth of this remains to be confirmed. It was also heard that the French Police had handed over the defendant Mirate Kosk to the competent headquarters for questioning. By the evening, no one had come to the funeral parlor to identify the deceased's body.</p>
<h3>YMCA Hosts Recruiting Committee Leaders</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai hosted 70 people, including the 40 team leaders of this year's YMCA Recruiting Committee, donation leaders, and recruiting committee members, at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. The atmosphere was lively and energetic. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Wen Lanting, Du Yuesheng, Cai Jingjun, Bei Songsun, Guo Shun, Yuan Ludeng, Jin Guobao, Pei Jiande, Jin Ketian, Wang Boyuan, Xu Xingchu, Yang Meinan, Gu Jun, Jin Tingsun, Bi Zibi, Xu Xinliu, Yu Zuoting, Shi Zhikun, Pei Zhenyong, Li Ximou, Wu Zhihao, Lu Wenshao, Zheng Chengqing, Liu Zhaoxiang, Hu Xiyuan, Zhang Yuliang, and others, totaling 70 people.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech: During the event, Wang Xiaolai stood up and said, "Today, Yu Qiaqing and I, in our capacity as the chief and deputy commanders of this year's YMCA Recruiting Committee, are hosting you all. We are honored by your presence. The YMCA has a 35-year history in Shanghai and occupies an important position in today's Shanghai. The various social programs it has initiated have greatly benefited society and the nation. This year's Recruiting Committee is happening during a time of social recession. However, the YMCA is not afraid and continues to move forward, overcoming difficulties. Judging from the results of the past two announcements, we can confidently predict a successful outcome. This spirit of dauntlessness is a characteristic that Shanghai society should emulate today. Only in this way can we break through the current economic difficulties in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: Just now, Mr. Wang Xiaolai said that we must break through all difficulties in this recession, which gave me a profound understanding. Compared to other countries, China's wealth is too poor. China's poverty is not the poverty of the country, not the poverty of the people, nor the poverty of materials, but the poverty of not working hard, not struggling. People cannot fully use their talents, materials cannot be fully used, land cannot be fully utilized, and goods cannot flow smoothly. To break through the current economic difficulties, we only need to work hard to ensure that people can fully use their talents, land can be fully utilized, materials can be fully used, and goods can flow smoothly. Then, not only can we overcome the difficulties, but the country and the people can also become prosperous and strong. Therefore, we should emulate the spirit of perseverance and hard work to strive forward. As for the YMCA, it is a group that benefits the country and society, and we should help it so that its work can be promoted and its finances can be maintained. This kind of support is also a duty that we should fulfill. Because we live in this era, we should dedicate part of our time, energy, and resources to doing social work. Although it directly helps others, it indirectly benefits ourselves. This year's Recruiting Committee coincides with the economic downturn in Shanghai. We are participating in the YMCA to fight together, which is also to fight together against the economic recession. This year, under the leadership of Minister Kong and the efforts of everyone present, success can be predicted."</p>
<p>Report by Executive Secretary: Yang Yihui, the Executive Secretary of the YMCA Recruiting Committee, reported that this year's Recruiting Committee is organized into 40 recruiting teams with the goal of 3,000 members and 60,000 shares of membership fees. In addition, there are donation leaders and recruiting committee members who are responsible for donating 20,000 shares. The period is only three and a half weeks, which is very short. As of this week, the recruiting teams have exceeded more than half of their goals. The performance of the donation committee members has been very good. The total score will be announced at the closing ceremony next Wednesday (April 10). Judging from the current situation, the outcome will be very satisfactory. Finally, Lu Ganchen, the General Secretary of the YMCA, thanked everyone on behalf of the YMCA. The guests and hosts parted on good terms.</p>
<h3>Private Vegetable Markets Should Focus on Cleanliness</h3>
<p>Within the Public Concession, in addition to the vegetable markets built by the Municipal Council (i.e., small vegetable markets), there are also several vegetable markets operated by private individuals. To maintain cleanliness, new regulations have been specially formulated, requiring all garbage and waste in these vegetable markets to be swept clean. The methods must also be deemed satisfactory by the Municipal Council. These regulations have now been added as special clauses to the vegetable market license regulations.</p>

<h3>Tao Bosun Talks About Painful Experiences on His Return Trip; He Was Interrogated by the Puppet Manchurian Government; A Glimpse of Japan's Defense Against Russia</h3>
<p>Tao Bosun of Lianhua Film Company, the representative of our country attending the Soviet Russian International Film Exhibition, returned home a week ago. A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Tao yesterday. According to Tao, after returning home, he originally planned to go to Nanjing immediately to report everything, but due to the company's busy affairs, he had been delayed. Zhang Chong, the director of the Film Division of the Central Propaganda Committee, has come to Shanghai. After meeting with Zhang, he will decide whether to give an oral report or a written report. While in Soviet Russia, he stayed in the conference room and did not make general observations about Soviet Russia. However, in terms of the Soviet Russian film industry, the speed of progress can be said to be changing rapidly every day. When he gives his report in the future, the Soviet Russian film industry may not be what it used to be. When returning home, he passed through the so-called "Manchukuo" via the Siberian Railway, and what he saw was quite distressing. When he arrived in Manchuria and planned to transfer to the North Manchurian Railway and the South Manchurian Railway to Dalian, he had more than five hours to spare, but more than three hours were spent being interrogated by Japanese and puppet Manchurian officials. The questions were mostly strange, such as whether the Soviet Russian government had military deployments along the Siberian Railway, whether there were troop movements, how many troops there were, and whether there were supply shipments. He was also asked for his opinion on the sale of the China Eastern Railway. However, it can also be seen that Japan is wary of Russia. He has made summary notes of his experiences on this trip and will publish them for the Chinese people after drafting them.</p>
<h3>Multiple Arrests for Using Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>Hua Detective Tang Pengfei and Wu De Kui of the Yulin Road Police Station learned at 7:30 PM the day before yesterday that someone was using counterfeit banknotes for profit inside the Hongyuan Inn on Huade Road. They reported this to Head Constable Peng, who coordinated with Western detectives to secretly go to the address. They arrested Guo Qingxiang, Yu Xiyuan, Chen Xingsong, Wang Zhufu, Chen Hesheng, Chen Yuqin, and others from Hubei, totaling a thousand people. Beside them and under their beds, they seized seventeen one-yuan notes and one ten-yuan note from the Bank of China. They then went to Chen Hesheng's home at Bai Fuli on Yangzhou Road and found two one-yuan notes from the Bank of China and one one-yuan note from the Siming Bank in a box. They also went to Chen Yuqin's home at No. 13 Yidali on Yangzhou Road and seized nine silver dollars. All were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department presented the background, stating that the defendant Guo Qingxiang had used a counterfeit one-yuan Bank of China note to buy firewood at Wei Sanfang's firewood shop at No. 619 Yangshupu Road at 11:00 AM on the 30th of last month. Wei noticed and refused to exchange it, leading to a dispute that reached the police station. Guo claimed he was a small bowl vendor, and the counterfeit note was mistakenly received from a customer. The head constable believed him and released him after a reprimand. The note was sent to the Inspectorate General, which sent it to the bank for verification. Unexpectedly, during the arrest at the small inn on the mainland, two more identical counterfeit one-yuan notes were found on Guo, and the numbers of the counterfeit notes found in the defendants' pockets were consecutive. However, the defendants all claimed at the police station that they were small vendors or boatmen, and the counterfeit currency came from customers or boat passengers. The case was requested to be postponed for further investigation. The counterfeit banknotes and silver dollars were presented for inspection, and the defendants' responses were evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.</p>
<h3>Beiping Woman Sues Husband for Divorce; Recounts Insults and Abuse; Husband Liu Houzai Claims to Be from a Family of Scholars; Affection Was Not Bad; Must Be Family Encirclement; Court Orders Out-of-Court Reconciliation and Reschedules Hearing</h3>
<p>He Min, a woman from Beiping, is currently 21 years old and previously studied at Wenquan Middle School in her hometown. Her eldest brother, He Sen, works at the Bank of China, and her second brother, He Yan, works at the Lixing Foreign Firm in Shanghai. In 1931, He Yan fell ill and lacked care, so he telegraphed his sister to come to Shanghai. Since He Min was unfamiliar with Shanghai, he entrusted Liu Houzai (31 years old), a native of Dantu and former classmate at the Sino-French Industrial College, currently an official at the National Tariff Commission, to pick her up at the station. Liu, after seeing He Min, found her attractive and well-educated, intending to make her his permanent companion. Fearing He Yan's opposition, he devised a plan to tutor He Min, inviting her to his home. One day, when He Min went to Liu's place, no one else was there. Liu closed the door, intending to make advances. He Min firmly refused, but Liu was skilled in martial arts and had great strength. The room contained</p>
<p>swords and other weapons.</p>
<p>Liu used these to threaten her. He Min wanted to shout but, to save face, only resisted with force. As a result, she was overpowered and raped. Afterward, He did not dare to speak out. Unexpectedly, Liu went to He's mother, He Zhu Jiantang, the next day to propose marriage. After several attempts, he achieved his goal. Thus, in October 1931, the wedding was held at the Da Zhonghua Hotel, with Chu Minyi as the witness. After the marriage, He Min continued to study at the Patriotic Women's School and the East Asia Physical Education College but dropped out because Liu did not pay the tuition. Initially, the couple's relationship could be maintained, but later, Liu's</p>
<p>attitude suddenly changed.</p>
<p>He would often abuse and beat He Min. Sometimes, when Liu went out to perform martial arts, he would force her to accompany him and demand money. If she refused, she would be beaten severely. Last summer, he stripped her of all her clothes and forced her to stand naked on the balcony, for all to see. One day, the western apartment opposite the defendant's home at 1455 Avenue Edward VII, He Min held her daughter, who was born, in front of the window. The westerners in the apartment asked how old the child was, and Liu, seeing this, stripped the girl of her clothes and removed his own trousers, forcing himself upon her, making</p>
<p>the westerners opposite</p>
<p>witness this. Later, through the introduction of Huang Heqing, the woman taught Mandarin at an American's place, earning sixty yuan a month. Half of this subsidized Liu's family, and half was used for the clothing of her two daughters (the eldest two years old, the youngest nine months). Later, the American went to Hong Kong, and the woman went with her. After the American returned to her country, He returned to Shanghai. Unable to bear Liu's abuse, she engaged lawyers Huang Renlong and Guo Nanqiang to file a petition with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting a divorce from Liu, repayment of a loan of one thousand yuan, clothes and other items worth one thousand yuan, and educational expenses for the two daughters until they reached the age of twenty, totaling twenty thousand and one hundred and sixty yuan, and alimony for herself of fourteen thousand and four hundred yuan. Later, because she was able to</p>
<p>earn a living by teaching,</p>
<p>she voluntarily waived the alimony. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi opened the fourteenth civil court session for questioning. He Min recounted the above facts, adding that the defendant had previously written a note stating that he would never beat He Min. When he later beat her, she showed him the note, but he said, "It's not that I want to beat you, but a ghost possesses me," and tore up the note. At the same time, she submitted a handwritten document detailing the abuse and humiliation she suffered, totaling thousands of words. Lawyer Huang Renlong also presented a letter from Liu to the plaintiff,</p>
<p>expressing remorse,</p>
<p>to prove that abuse had occurred. When questioned, Liu Houzai claimed, "My family is also a family of scholars, and I could never do what the plaintiff described. In my opinion, the plaintiff's request for a divorce is not voluntary but due to family encirclement. Her second brother was strongly opposed to our marriage, and our feelings for each other are not bad." The court reviewed the evidence and ordered a postponement of the hearing, instructing both parties to attempt reconciliation.</p>
<h3>Lost Children from Pudong Return Home; General Association for the Relief of Women and Children Entrusted to Send Back; Pudong Native Place Association Separately Sends Home</h3>

<h3>Using Copper Counterfeit Gold Rings to Deceive Female Workers of Money Detained</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday, four Suzhou men, including Lin Deli, suddenly appeared in Shudeli on Robison Road, West Shanghai, using several counterfeit gold rings made of copper, acting as if they were selling them, deceiving ignorant female workers by deliberately selling them at low prices, each for only two or three dollars. Many female workers were deceived. A patrolman in the area noticed this and, upon investigation, immediately arrested the four criminals and brought them back to the Caojiadu Branch. Three counterfeit gold rings were found on the criminals, along with twenty dollars and fifty-two cents in small change obtained through fraud. After questioning by Criminal Officer Xing, the suspects confessed their names as Lin Deli, 34 years old; Chen Dongsheng, 19 years old; Chen Dexing, 16 years old; and Li Ajin, 15 years old, all admitting to conspiring to defraud money. They were immediately prepared for document and transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>The Jin Cheng Bank's 1934 Business Report (2) (10)</h3>
<p>As for this year's silk prices, there is almost half the difference compared to 1933, and it cannot be compared to 1931. For example, the highest price for superior Shanghai silk in 1933 was 1,000 yuan per dan, and the lowest price was 630 yuan, while this year's highest price was only 700 yuan, and the lowest price was 480 yuan. For medium-grade Sichuan silk, the highest price in 1933 was 900 yuan, and the lowest price was 640 yuan, while this year's highest price was only 650 yuan, and the lowest price was 390 yuan. However, although silk prices have fallen, the foreign sales market has remained sluggish. This year's total export volume was 95,413 quintals, a decrease of 20,294 quintals or 17.54% compared to 1933. The export value was 28,423,639 yuan, a decrease of 28,292,427 yuan or 49.97% compared to 1931. There are three reasons for the sluggish sales: (1) The biggest reason is that there is a large amount of silk in foreign markets. For example, the United States had as many as 96,787 bales of silk in stock this year, while the sales volume was only 26,956 bales, resulting in a large reduction in demand. (2) Japanese silk sales to the United States have decreased, and they have turned to dumping in France, so Chinese silk has been squeezed out. (3) The tax revenue in the Nanyang Islands and other places is extremely heavy, making it difficult to promote sales. The high silver price and long gold exchange rate are also obstacles to the export of Chinese silk. However, domestic sales have increased slightly this year due to low prices. The silk consumption in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is estimated to be more than 20,000 bales. As for silk fabrics, due to competition from the same industry, the price of satin, which was 2.67 yuan per yard in 1933, is only 1.78 yuan this year. The price of silk, which was 1.56 yuan per yard in 1933, is only 89 cents this year. Although silk sales have increased, the low price is still not helpful. If the government does not make the greatest determination, the silk weaving industry will help each other, and after the international currency war comes to an end, the future of the silk industry will be very bleak.</p>
<p>(3) Flour Industry: China's flour industry is centered on Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuxi, and Hankou. This year, 93 factories started work. According to the statistics of the Tax Administration, from January to September, the production volume was 46,283,393 bags, an increase of 11.25% compared with the same period last year. The sales volume was 52,800,483 bags, a decrease of 2.94% compared with the same period last year. Production increased and sales decreased, resulting in abundant inventory and slow market prices. Taking standard flour as an example, the price per bag fell to the lowest price of 1.933 yuan in May. After June, due to prolonged drought and the failure of wheat harvests in the United States and Canada, prices gradually rose. In September, new grains were on the market, and rice prices fell, and flour prices followed suit. In addition, the foreign flour market fell more than it rose, and the flour on the market was filled again, and flour prices fell again. Statistics for the whole year show that the average price of standard flour was 2.409 yuan per bag, a slight drop of 0.03% compared with 1933.</p>
<p>The above refers to China's larger-scale industries. If it comes to the match, cigarette, paper, enamel, rubber, thermos bottle, cosmetics, and knitwear industries, or the tax rate is increased, or foreign merchants dump their products, or there is competition from the same industry, sales are sluggish and conditions are deteriorating. Only the oil extraction, cement, and coal industries are booming. General businesses, due to falling prices and high expenses, are mostly losing money and making little profit. Due to poor turnover, a large number of companies have gone bankrupt. For example, on average, Tianjin has about two to three hundred stores going bankrupt every month, and Xuzhou has six to seven hundred stores going bankrupt, leaving only more than 1,600 stores. This is because the entire economic situation is like this, and it is not entirely due to the lack of human planning. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Children's Cultural Association Issues Declaration</p>
<p>The Chinese Children's Cultural Association has scheduled Tao Xingzhi and Wei Bingxin to give speeches on children's issues at the Sino-Western Radio Station from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on April 4th and issue the following declaration. In our country, children have always been forgotten. They are appendages to adults, playthings of adults. They have no freedom, no education. What adults give them is beating, cheating, and teaching them to completely submit and be slaves. Rich young masters and ladies enjoy blessings at home, serving as playthings. Some are bookworms in piles of books. Those without money herd cattle and work for others, idle around the streets, and become little beggars. At worst, they are sold or abandoned by their parents. What adults give children is a cruel world, a world of slaves, a world of deception, and a world of terror. But now the government has officially announced that Children's Year will begin on August 1st of this year and has drafted measures to protect children. From now on, this world belongs to children. We must break the world created by adults and liberate children, especially liberating their hands and minds, to create a new children's world. In the children's world, there is only truth and no deceit, only justice and no cruelty, only freedom and no oppression, only creation and no imitation, only people among people and no people above people. It is a world of freedom, equality, mutual assistance, self-defense, and respect. This world does not belong to a few children, but to the masses of children. We must never only care about one part and forget the other part. We, who purely serve children's culture, should unite to work for this new children's world and to build children's culture in this world. We are not building this well for children to enjoy, but rather becoming a part of the children's world to participate in this work. We are a living cell in the children's world, helping the children's world grow. The work we need to do now is to promote all children's cultural construction, study all children's problems, study children's education, create children's science, children's literature, children's art, improve children's health, re-evaluate the improvement of children's entertainment culture, and create the most rationalized children's culture in the children's world. This is our declaration. Initiators (in order of stroke count of surname): Wen Yuyang, Bai Tao, Shen Dinghe, He Gongchao, Li Baiying, Li Chucai, Song Yi, Yu Zhen, Shao Mingjiu, Zhou Shang, Zhou Tianlai, Zhou Yimin, Zhou Shoujuan, Lin Handa, Lin Yin, Hu Xu, Hu Shuyi, Yu Zhonghua, Sun Yucai, Hou Fanshu, Xu Yingchang, Xu Songting, Fan Yunliu, Zhang Xiyu, Zhang Yiping, Zhang Youjian, Liang Shijie, Ma Chonggan, Ni Xiying, Chen Jicheng, Huang Yide, Huang Jiping, Huang Chuncai, Yu Zheguang, Zheng Renzhe, Bao Weixiang, Qian Xuanqing, Mi Wenhuan, Yan Zhenyu, Wei Bingxin.</p>

<h3>Belgium Strictly Limits Foreign Students; Ministry of Education Issues Notice</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 2nd) The Ministry of Education has approved the letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs based on the request submitted by the embassy in Belgium, investigating the rules of the Belgian government restricting foreign students, which are particularly strict. The Shanghai Shen Bao had previously published an announcement from the Belgian Embassy in China, the content of which was quite detailed, but many students coming to study in Belgium still do not follow the procedures and rashly set sail, wandering in other countries after arriving in Europe without being able to enter the country. The situation of their predicament is particularly pitiful. In view of this, this embassy recently obtained the full text of the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' instruction to its embassies and consulates abroad on this matter, and now specially transcribes and submits it, intending to request the transfer to the Ministry of Education, so that the students with study certificates and the institutions handling study procedures, such as the Student Federation and the China Travel Service, can be earnestly informed. Accordingly, a copy of the full text and translation of the original Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs instruction is sent together with the letter, requesting review and handling. The Ministry of Education has replied that there are still two points in the original text that need to be discussed with the Belgian side, namely: 1. Paragraph 1, Item A of the original text states that to request a visa, the local competent authority should formally certify that the student has the ability to study higher learning in a Belgian university. Before our country's students go abroad, they must submit it to the Ministry for approval to issue a study certificate. The issuance of study certificates, public-funded students must have the qualifications stipulated in Article 8 of the Regulations on Studying Abroad, and self-funded students must have the qualifications stipulated in Article 26. Moreover, the applicant's academic qualifications are noted on the study certificate, so the study certificate in our country has exceeded the proof of the certificate holder's academic ability. 2. Regarding the certificate of good conduct stipulated in Item B of Paragraph 1, it is proposed to determine that it should be issued by the original school attended by each student. The above two points are proposed to be transferred by your ministry to the Belgian embassy in China for decision, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is replied with a letter, and notices are sent to all departments and bureaus and vocational schools and above.</p>

<h3>International Volleyball: China Defeated the United States Yesterday, Result 41 to 30</h3>

Although China could easily have won in three straight sets, in the second set, China took a 10-7 lead. When it was the opponent's turn to serve, China's Chen Zongqi and Zhou Dayun in the front row repeatedly panicked and neglected, losing seven points in a row and allowing the United States to win 15-11. In the third game, China showed its strength, winning 15-5. The total score was China 41, United States 30. China has already defeated the Jews and now the United States. Only one game remains against Russia. The Russian team has also defeated the United States, and its strength is no less than that of China. The next encounter will be a tough battle. It is difficult to predict who will win the championship. Last night's match between Russia and the Jews was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. The results and lineups of last night's China-United States match are as follows:</p>
<p>China:</p>
<p>Qiu Guangxie, Mai Bingyao</p>
<p>Wei Ding, Chen Zongqi</p>
<p>Zheng Yiquan, Zhou Dayun</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— (Zhu Renyi)</p>
<p>In recent years, the "revival of antiquity" movement is very fashionable. I guess these people may grow a tail in the future, like apes before humans.</p>
<p>The lives of people who shout "unemployment" in society are generally more prosperous than those of laborers who work all day long but cannot eat well or dress warmly.</p>
<p>The best results of film education are for modern girls, who imitate the decorations of ordinary stars and practice the art of kissing with young men.</p>
<p>If the saying "spring is not a day for reading" is correct, then it is natural for young people in their youth to indulge in wine and women.</p>
<p>Premier Sun said: "Knowing is difficult, doing is not difficult." But "deliberating without deciding, deciding without acting." Things will ultimately be difficult to succeed.</p>
<h3>Hometown of Green Pearl</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Bobai, Guangxi, a Green Luo Village more than thirty miles from the city. I'm afraid not many people know that this is the hometown of Green Pearl? There are beautiful mountains and rivers, and beautiful patterned fields; next to it is the Green Pearl River, the sluggish flowing water, morning and evening, emitting weeping historical tones, who would have thought that it was telling the misfortune of its master?</p>
<p>"The east wind at dusk resents the crying birds, fallen flowers still resemble a person falling from a building."</p>
<p>"Where are the singing and dancing people of that year? The Kingdom of the Golden Valley is empty and the moon is bright!"</p>
<p>Speaking of Green Pearl, these sentences will come to mind involuntarily. Her life experience is indeed too painful!</p>
<p>Some female historians say: "Green Pearl, the beloved concubine of Shi Chong of Jin, Sun Xiu sought her, but Chong did not allow it; Xiu falsely ordered the arrest of Chong. Green Pearl jumped from the building and died..." But there is no clear record of her hometown. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Green Pearl's surname is Liang, originally a daughter of a farming family. It is said that there is an ancient well in her village, the water is sweet and delicious, and those who draw and eat it give birth to many beautiful daughters; later this well was called Green Pearl Well. Green Pearl, in her youth, was hired by Shi Chong with three bushels of bright pearls and hid in the Golden Valley Garden. After falling from the building, a wisp of ghostly soul flew back towards her distant hometown, and then manifested in a fort in the village, and the people of the fort built a temple to worship her: this fort is called Green Pearl Fort. At first, the temple was just a polygonal stone, and later it was changed to a clothed body. Between the years of the Republic of China 15 and 16, the incense was extremely prosperous. But soon after, following the trend of overthrowing gods, the temple was completely destroyed, leaving only broken bricks and rubble.</p>
<p>There are also various anecdotes about Green Pearl, as long as you go to those villages, you can still hear them at any time, but they have been spread and dyed with superstitious colors. As for the Green Pearl Well, it has disappeared due to the age.</p>
<p>These are all recorded in more detail in the Bobai County Chronicle.</p>
<h3>Sketches on the Inland River Steamer</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Every time I return to the countryside from Shanghai, I always take that small inland river steamer that can accommodate three or four hundred passengers.</p>
<p>On the inland river steamer, I always feel that this is a miniature of the entire society. It can also be said that this is a reduced social map. If you don't believe me, please see the following description:</p>
<p>Many passengers, men, women, old, and young, some take first class, some take second class, and many male and female passengers are squeezed into a small, cramped third-class cabin with polluted air. Isn't this high and low cabin grade a symbol of the division of rich and poor classes in society?</p>
<p>Furthermore, after you have settled down, the shouts of the vendors will make it impossible for you to settle down. Their purpose is naturally to hope that you can buy some things. However, when you ask him to trade, their hype is so big that it often fools those who don't often go out. For example, selling oranges, first saying that two cents can buy six, if you bargain for twelve, or even fourteen, they will slowly come to accommodate you and succeed in the transaction. Isn't the performance of this hypocritical and fraudulent situation a miniature that can also express social phenomena?</p>
<p>Other things such as badge grades not buying boat tickets, immoral people occupying seats, the snobbery of the steamer crew, the bullying of rural women, and so on, one strange drama after another is performed one by one on the steamer. Isn't this a reflection of social phenomena?</p>
<p>Therefore, I always feel that the inland river steamer is really a miniature of the entire society, and I often have this feeling every time I take it!</p>

<p>Chapter 10: Night Talks of Miserable Life Are Originally Straw Shoes, Scattered Wind and Rain Too Deceptive Eight</p>
<p>Jia Duocai smiled and said, "When you talk about serving, I dare not say anything more. But I agree very much with what you say that women know women's hearts. It's rare that you are so enthusiastic. Tomorrow, I will trouble you to run with me twice." As he spoke, he held his fists and cupped them twice. Huanhua smiled slightly and said, "Run twice? What do you want to run twice for? Even if you run once, I think the strength is more than enough." Jia Duocai smiled and said, "Miss Yang herself believes that she has this certainty, so naturally she won't be lying. But if the strength of running once is more than enough, then naturally you only need to run half a time. May I ask how to run this half a time?" Huanhua smiled and said, "Master Jia, you can't quibble with me. If you want to quibble with me, I can't do it. My intention is just to say that it will definitely be successful in one trip." As she spoke, she stood at the edge of the table, touched the teapot with her hand, and said with a smile, "I only talk to Master Jia, the light is dim and the tea is cold. Let me go and call the tea room to pour you a cup of hot tea to drink." Jia Duocai smiled and said, "We are talking very interestingly, let's continue talking, why do you want the tea room to run back and forth?" Huanhua didn't say anything else. Just leaned against the table and stood smiling. After a pause, she took out a powder box from her arms, opened the box lid, and used the powder puff to apply powder to her face. Jia Duocai smiled and said, "Hey! Does Xi'an also have this thing?" Huanhua smiled and said, "Without these things, how can modern people be modern?" Jia Duocai said, "That's not how you say it, because there are modern figures in Xi'an, so these modern supplies have come to Xi'an one after another." Huanhua smiled and said, "Then, you still think I'm very modern." As she spoke, she turned her head halfway and smiled at Jia Duocai. In fact, at this time, the light of the kerosene lamp was even dimmer. Whether she was laughing or crying, it was difficult to tell. (172)</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>It is strange to say, although the Empress Dowager is already a very old woman, her eyes are still very clear and sharp; she looked at the blue silk for a while, then turned her head and said to a girl:</p>
<p>"Wrong! There should be another color here! Look for yourself, the color of this first strand is so deep, but the color of the second strand is so light, compared to the others, isn't it too uneven in depth! There must be a strand in the middle that is slightly lighter than the strand above, and slightly darker than the strand below, otherwise it will definitely not connect! Obviously you didn't pay enough attention, so you skipped one!"</p>
<p>I bravely walked closer to take a closer look, and indeed I also felt that the colors of the two strands of silk were too far apart: I had to add another strand of harmonizing color in the middle to make these dozens of strands of blue silk have an average depth. Although the girl responsible for washing and dyeing this blue silk has been engaged in this work in the palace for several years, she still couldn't think that the colors she dyed had the drawbacks of being too deep or too light; but after the Empress Dowager pointed it out, everyone could see that there was indeed a color missing there very clearly. Even I, who am still completely ignorant of the silk-making work, immediately saw it! Readers, think about it: among dozens of deep and light blue colors, the Empress Dowager only needs to take a look to know that a harmonizing color is missing between certain two colors. Isn't such a sharp gaze admirable! (283)</p>
<h3>Two Lullabies</h3>
<p>— Feng Jiawei</p>
<p>There seem to be many kinds of lullabies. Usually we often hear: Sister Flowers, Cradle Song, Lullaby, New Lullaby, etc. Among them, I think Sister Flowers and Lullaby can represent the motherhood of two classes.</p>
<p>Although they are broadcast in the same way from radio or gramophone, if we listen carefully, the misery of the old tune of Sister Flowers and the joy of the tune of Lullaby, our feelings are absolutely different.</p>
<p>If we look at the meaning of the words: Sister Flowers is like the sobbing of a miserable woman. "Child, sleep, your mother has no money to buy you a cradle, so she has to hold you in her arms, your father has no money to buy you a rocking horse, although the rocking horse is so good, but only the father is pretending to climb." What a tragic story! And Lullaby? But it is precisely the demeanor of the bourgeoisie. Although the child has not fallen asleep, the cake to eat when he wakes up is already prepared.</p>
<p>Although they are completely different stories, they are both unknowingly drilled into the eardrums of people living in buildings from radio or gramophone.</p>
<h3>The Tobacco Habit of Rats and Monkeys</h3>
<p>— Ning Ziqiang</p>
<p>When I worked in Cao's mansion, I heard the housekeeper talk about how monkeys and rats also had a tobacco habit, which was quite interesting. The housekeeper said: There was a person who was addicted to opium. Every time he swallowed clouds and puffed out fog, the monkey he kept would always cling to his knees and couldn't bear to leave. After a long time, the master went out far away, and the monkey stayed at home. The tobacco fire broke out, causing it to be unable to control itself, and it actually tore up the master's bedding and bed curtains without leaving anything behind. When the master returned, he knew it was the monkey's prank, and in great anger, he beat the monkey to death with a stick. Afterwards, he regretted his recklessness, but it was already too late!</p>
<p>Every time a certain A in the village smoked, a rat would squat on the top of his tent and not leave. This happened every day, with few interruptions. A had seen it many times and was not surprised at all. One day, A moved away, and the rat had already died on the top of the tent!</p>
<p>Common sense</p>
<h3>Radio Waves</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>There are two kinds of radio waves, positive and negative. Positive is the Plus sign, denoted as +, and negative is the Minus sign, denoted as -. Based on the direction of the current, they can also be divided into two types: direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). Current flowing in the same direction is called direct current, such as batteries and storage batteries. If the direction of the current alternates, it's called alternating current. The electric lights in our homes switch between positive and negative 50 or 60 times per second. Nowadays, radio receivers also come in DC and AC versions. DC receivers use batteries, while AC receivers use the power lines. (1) But what does "radio wave" mean? For example, alternating current, as mentioned above, can be called oscillating current. In other words, it's like throwing a stone into a still pond, which then creates ripples. Electrical waves are the same, hence the name "radio waves." If a current oscillates millions of times per second, millions of radio waves are created. Typically, vacuum tubes can be used to generate radio waves. (2) But what does "wave" mean? Generally, sound travels in the air at a speed of 331 meters per second. The speed of radio waves is incredibly fast, similar to light, traveling 300 million meters per second. So, if electricity oscillates millions of times per second, millions of radio waves are generated. Dividing the speed of radio waves (300 million meters per second) by this number (millions) gives a wavelength of 300 meters. The broadcast frequencies seen daily in newspapers, such as JOAK 870 KC and JOB 750 KC, represent the number of waves per second. Dividing 300 million meters by this number gives the wavelength. (3) Long waves and short waves: people who don't understand radio waves might think that a wavelength of 870 means 870 meters. Some also believe that long waves are heard faster than short waves, but this is a big mistake. The length of the wave has nothing to do with the speed at which radio waves propagate. Originally, sound and light cannot travel through obstacles, but radio waves can pass through wood, stone, steel, and tiles. However, when these peculiar radio waves encounter metal, they eventually transform back into the original oscillating current. Wireless telegraphs and wireless receivers utilize this property. When we turn on a radio, the initial static sound we hear is the sound of the radio waves arriving. When a reporter at a radio station speaks, complex radio waves are emitted based on the loudness and pitch of their voice. When these waves reach the antenna we have installed, they convert into oscillating alternating current, which is then rectified by a vacuum tube (or crystal). It is then amplified by an amplifier and sent to a loudspeaker to reproduce the original speech. As for the inventor of radio waves, it was the German Heinrich Hertz in 1888, 47 years ago. Based on these radio waves, the Italian Guglielmo Marconi invented the wireless telegraph. In 1906 (29 years ago), the American Lee de Forest further invented the vacuum tube, and since then, the wireless telephone industry worldwide has progressed rapidly.</p>

<h3>Finance: Denial of Inflation; Speculative Funds Rapidly Retreat; Cantonese Banks Aggressively Sell Short Positions; Fierce Competition to Sell; Significant Drop of 22.1 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw the Central Bank first selling shillings, followed by Qiao Zhifu and Cantonese banks aggressively selling, stimulating bearish sentiment. In addition, the relentless short selling by Cantonese banks continued to exert pressure, causing market volatility and an extremely sharp decline. Initially, overseas silver markets showed a slight contraction in the UK and stability in the US. Forward silver prices in Montevideo dropped by 0.2 to 0.55. Exchange rates were generally higher, and London spot gold rose by 7.5 pence, but market sentiment remained unsatisfied. In pre-market trading, prices retreated to 897-898 yuan. Sellers remained active, pushing prices down to 893-894 yuan. The Central Bank announced its official exchange rate, with the pound stable and the US dollar up 1.25. Customs gold units rose by 8 li, and the standard price for speculative funds rose to 910.2 yuan. Subsequently, prices stabilized slightly. After the market opened, the HSBC's active buying of shillings caused prices to fall and then rise again. However, due to weak market sentiment, prices gradually declined after banks seized the opportunity to sell. The Central Bank aggressively sold shillings, which suddenly affected market sentiment, even though Sassoon was buying gold. Prices continued to fall, and Cantonese banks took the opportunity to sell bars, driving prices below 890 yuan. Sassoon bought to cover short positions at low prices, and prices stabilized slightly, hovering around 890 yuan. However, the Central Bank continued to aggressively sell, and bearish news, such as a Reuter's report stating that Song Ziwen had told reporters that he guaranteed China would not inflate its currency, fueled bearish sentiment. Short positions wavered, and the decline was quite severe, breaking through the 880 yuan mark again. Sassoon was still buying at low prices, providing some support. However, with the Central Bank and Qiao Zhifu continuing to sell shillings aggressively, the market remained weak at midday. In the afternoon, due to a lack of supply in the off-exchange market, short sellers took profits and bought back, pushing prices back above 880 yuan. After the market reopened, Chinese merchants briefly bought to cover short positions, reigniting bullish sentiment and driving prices up. However, banks rushed to sell, pushing prices lower again. At this point, the Bombay market rose, but the price went down again. Though the price in Bombay was reported to be 6.7 annas, there was still a rebound. However, the banks' willingness to sell was activated, and even though Sassoon was buying, the exchange rate was difficult to improve, leaving the sellers confident and the market remaining soft. Cantonese banks, led by Yu Yong, continued to sell heavily, exerting pressure and finally breaking through the 880 yuan mark. However, due to Sassoon's buying at low prices, there was a brief rebound. The Indian silver rate remained unchanged for the second time, so the price lingered around 880 yuan. Finally, with Cantonese banks repeatedly selling shillings and banks showing no signs of buying, the exchange rate deteriorated, and market sentiment worsened. The market closed extremely weak. The market situation was weak throughout the day, but there were several rallies along the way. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>

Heng Yu, Yuan Mao, and Yong took advantage of low prices to buy at 4 yuan. Fu Xing, Yong Ju, Chang, Yu Qing, and retail investors sold bars, gradually retreating to 1.3 yuan.

<h3>Foreign Exchange: A Chorus of Selling – The Process Gradually Lengthens</h3>
<p>According to foreign wires, the London spot rate closed down 0.0625, with no change in the forward rate. News on the ground was that the market was soft after trading hours, due to trades below the official rate of 25 and a lack of buyers. New York silver prices were unchanged, and forward silver prices in Montevideo fell by 2 to 5.5. London spot gold rose by 7.5 pence. The pound rose against the dollar by 0.0625, and the dollar rose against the pound by 0.01125. The pound fell against the French franc by 0.06 pounds, and the dollar rose against the French franc by 0.75. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the spot selling rate for the pound at 1 shilling 6.3125 pence and the US dollar at 36.6875 yuan, compared to the previous close, the pound was stable and the dollar fell 0.0625 yuan, due to the rise in the exchange rate. Market sentiment was slightly moved by news reports. The Central Bank announced its official rate, with the pound stable and the US dollar up 0.125. Customs gold units rose by 8 li. The market was stable after opening. Banks had a willingness to sell, but the market tightened as HSBC continued to buy. Banks took advantage of high prices to continue selling. Chinese merchants' sentiment was depressed. The HSBC's official rate remained unchanged. The Central Bank forcefully sold shillings. There were many struggles in the middle because Sassoon bought. Later, foreign wires reported that Song Ziwen guaranteed that the country would not inflate its currency, and Chinese merchants' buying interest disappeared. The Central Bank and others continued to sell. The process became even harder. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu also came to sell. Although Sassoon bought, supply exceeded demand. The market was extremely loose at midday. In the afternoon market, Chinese merchants entered the market with a sudden desire to buy, and the market tightened once. Banks and Qiao Zhifu were still selling, but the market vacillated due to the initial report of a 6.7 anna decline in Indian silver. After Sassoon bought, the banks' willingness to sell did not abate, and Cantonese banks also came to sell and the market loosened. Finally, due to the lack of buying interest from banks, and the intense selling intention of Cantonese banks, the market hardened further. The closing spot selling rate was 1 shilling 6.6875 pence for the pound and 37.5 yuan for the US dollar. Compared with the previous close, the pound rose 0.0375 and the dollar hardened 0.0875 yuan. Chinese merchants' supply and demand were inconsistent, appearing to hedge, but it appeared that they were selling. Cantonese banks intensely sold shillings. Sassoon came to cover short positions. However, the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu repeatedly sold very intensely. The Central Bank vigorously sold shillings. Today's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Securities: The Bond Market is Extremely Quiet Before the Holiday; Securities Exchange Will Be Closed for Three Days of Spring Holiday Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was quiet due to the upcoming Spring Festival holiday, with a sluggish atmosphere among the various groups and increasingly thin trading volume. Large investors were mostly watching, with only swap transactions showing some activity. However, the 96 public bonds seemed slightly more active, with some buying in the 46th issue. Many others were shorting for swap transactions. The stable environment meant there was no reason to be pessimistic about market prices, but with the bulls being squeezed, it was temporarily difficult to raise prices. In the morning, the market opened with chaotic prices, with the lowest at 5 yuan, but the comparison was relatively firm. The next session was more stable, with most of the 21st and 35th issues being short swap transactions. Market prices improved slightly by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The afternoon market opened slightly better, but closed weaker again, with very small volumes, entering a stagnant state. Since Thursday to Saturday are Spring Festival holidays, there was little movement among the various groups. Yesterday's market price results were mostly up 0.1 to 0.3 yuan, and a few were down 0.1 yuan. The total trading volume was 7,208,000 yuan. The increase and decrease results are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>US Railroad Stocks Show Progress, Railroad Pension Regulations Have Not Been Decided</h3>
<p>New Feng Yang Bank reported that yesterday (April 1), the New York stock market was driven higher by railroad stocks, and the progress of railroad stocks was due to the Interstate Commerce Commission's approval of railroads' increased emergency freight rates. However, traders remained hesitant, awaiting the Supreme Court's decision on the railroad pension regulations. The price market rose due to the strength of US government bonds. Small exchange stocks were stable. The total trading volume for the day was 440,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower: Yesterday's Rumors Were Entirely Groundless; Bulls Greatly Disappointed in Yarn Flowers</h3>
<p>The yarn market is extremely weak, and the decline is intensifying. The rumors from yesterday were entirely unfounded. Now, the price of gold has fallen, leading to apathy. Additionally, foreign merchants are selling off due to price increases, as overseas yarn prices are relatively low. Therefore, as soon as the market rises, speculators sell short. However, current yarn business is still good.</p>
<p>Gold Rooster Retreats Quickly</p>
<p>At the opening of the raw yarn market, prices for all months trended downwards, and the situation was fragmented. The various rumors from yesterday were completely groundless, and the overseas cotton industry situation remains sluggish, leading to great disappointment among the bulls. Another piece of news is that in the past two days, a certain major bull has sold off a significant amount. As a result, the market feels particularly loose and chaotic. Consequently, each month's closing price was lower than yesterday's, with this month down 1.2 yuan and the far months down 0.578 yuan. The market atmosphere deteriorated further in the afternoon. It was said that a certain firm's funds from the morning session were goods being added to by foreign merchants. At the same time, overseas news remained unfavorable, and market prices softened. As a result, this month was unchanged, and the far months were down 0.478 yuan. Sales included 1850 bales of Changfeng, 600 bales of Yu Da, 700 bales of Dafu, 850 bales of Renfeng, 1100 bales of Xincheng, 1400 bales of Dafu, 850 bales of Tongji, 1100 bales of Senkang, 450 bales of Da, and 450 bales of Yi Chang. Purchases included 800 bales of Yi Da, 1000 bales of Yuan Da, 650 bales of Zhen Da, 700 bales of He Xing, 1600 bales of Yong Da, 600 bales of Heng Chang, and 1050 bales of De Da. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Balance</p>
<p>April 182.8 182.1 182.3 Down 1.20 41,550</p>
<p>May 181.7 181.1 181.1 Down 1.20 47,200</p>
<p>June 181.8 180.9 180.9 Down 1.30 41,450</p>

<p>September 182.9 182.0 182.0 Down 1.50 3,900</p>
<p>Total 224,250</p>
<p>Two Thousand Bales Actually Sold</p>
<p>Sales of current yarn are still good. Statistics show that various guilds bought a total of 2,000 bales throughout the day. Market sentiment is weak. The purchase amounts by various guilds are as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha 150 Inland 300 Guangdong 695 Xuzhou 150</p>
<p>Tianjin 245 Wuhu 20 Henan 195 Shantou 15</p>
<p>Xiamen 5 Jiangxi 10 Colleagues 15 Sichuan 150</p>
<p>Yunnan 80</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending soft, and the situation is very weak. This is because the state of American cotton is sluggish, Indian cotton is also flat, and the gold market has suddenly retreated. Shanghai has a large stock of cotton, with over 100,000 bales of Lingdou cotton. This cotton is not easy to resolve in the short term, so the pressure on the market feels increasingly heavy.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Retreats by Six Jiao</p>
<p>At the opening of the raw cotton market, prices for all months uniformly trended weak because the condition of new American cotton was not good, falling by more than ten pounds. Indian cotton showed mixed gains and losses, ranging from 0.05 to 1 rupee. The sudden drop in gold prices led to great disappointment among the bulls. As a result, the closing price for each month fell by 0.15 to 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The situation was even weaker in the afternoon. Financial circles engaged in further short selling. General market sentiment was that there was too much cotton in stock and that American cotton news remained unfavorable. As a result, leveraged long positions were closed out, making it even more difficult for the market to sustain itself. Consequently, the prices for all months fell by 0.15 to 0.25 or 0.35 yuan compared to the morning's closing price. Sales included 12,100 dan of Tongji, 5,200 dan of Dafeng, 3,900 dan of Gengfeng, 3,400 dan of Tongfeng, 1,800 dan of Shengyuan, 2,500 dan of Xincheng, 7,600 dan of Changhe, and 1,300 dan of Changyu. Purchases included 3,100 dan of Yuanda, 1,300 dan of Yifeng, 2,400 dan of Dafu, 1,700 dan of Ruida, 5,900 dan of Jiankang, 2,300 dan of Deji, 2,300 dan of Yuanxingchang, 1,800 dan of Yongda, 1,300 dan of Tongxing, and 1,200 dan of Yikang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Balance</p>
<p>April 34.40 34.15 34.15 Down 0.40 111,000</p>

<h3>New York Cotton Exchange Estimates This Year's World Cotton Production</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was quite uneasy due to the government's uncertain production management and surplus cotton disposal policies. Although foreign merchants made purchases at the opening, prices for all months still fell by 4 to 9 points. Subsequently, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, bulls closed out positions, and mills sold short, leading to a gradual decline. Later, a portion of the industry bought old cotton and covered short positions, leading to a slight recovery. There were few new transactions, and both buyers and sellers closed out positions to await developments. The exchange revised its estimate of global commercial cotton production to 22,396,000 bales, compared to 5,562,000 bales last year and 23,665,000 bales the year before. The closing was firm, with spot prices unchanged and futures down 3 to 11 points. English cotton spot prices fell 5 points, and futures fell 6 to 10 points. Indian cotton European exporters and Japanese merchants sold July Brooke White, but shorts covered May, with Plain Gujerat down 0.5 rupee, Oomra up 0.75 rupee, and Brooke White up 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (One day's telegram)</p>

<h3>Grains: Some Short Covering in Flour and Wheat Before the Holiday</h3>
<p>The flour market saw quiet trading, with only about 200,000 bags changing hands throughout the day. Both buyers and sellers showed little competition. As the flour exchange will be closed for four days for the Tomb Sweeping Festival holiday starting tomorrow, all parties are taking a wait-and-see approach. The trend in the flour market should be optimistic, as wheat prices have already risen this month, rice prices are soaring, raw materials have been scarce for a long time, and there is no certainty about the new wheat crop. Most market participants expect positive developments. However, yesterday, due to small reports of foreign wheat and requests for sales from factories, the market had to be suppressed. Nevertheless, short covering remained active, and market prices were able to hold up. As a result, prices for April to June were down 0.5 fen each, July was down 0.75 fen, and August and September were down 0.25 fen each.</p>
<p>Although international wheat prices are slightly lower, the lack of spot goods keeps sentiment firm. Furthermore, the grain exchange will be closed for four days starting today, and short covering is very active. Therefore, prices for both near and far months rose uniformly. The April price was boosted by spot goods by 0.5 fen, July was up 0.4 fen, and August was up 0.6 fen. The future trend is still expected to be positive. Spot wheat arrivals are few, and mill demand is very active. Yesterday, Shandong wheat was sold for 3.8 yuan, Zhifu wheat for 3.75 yuan, and Haizhou Jiangbei wheat for 3.72 yuan. Prices for lower grades were reduced accordingly, and prices were almost a jiao higher than the previous market. A total of over 2,000 bags were opened in the city and were divided among Xinda and Fuxin.</p>

<h3>Arrivals are Scarce; Local and Foreign Rice Prices Rise</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supplies from various guilds was relatively scarce, with only about ten firms arriving (for a total of over 2,000 shi). Due to dredging and dike construction in the local area, arrivals were fewer. Qingdao and Yantai guilds continued to handle over 1,000 bags, and the market became increasingly active. Prices for various grades of japonica and thin indica rice rose sharply by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan each. Du Jian and Yinyuan rice also showed strength.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of boats arriving from various rivers downstream was sparse, and sales in the market were not as good as in the previous two days. As prices were called up, Northern japonica rice and early indica thin indica rice rose by more than 0.2 yuan, and Du Jian rice also increased by over 0.1 yuan. Foreign long-grain and dark yuan rice also showed tightness.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Local merchants' buying demand is even more greedy. In addition to loading existing stocks, inland guilds are making greater efforts to search for supplies in the market. Although the Yangtze River guilds have demand, they are holding back to observe due to the inland guilds' competition to buy first. However, quite a few firms are directly distributing. The market trade is dominated by inland guilds, but the local market is also buying high-priced foreign rice due to the disputes among Changshu rice merchants and the small number of arrivals. The inland area mainly deals with various grades of Zhongguan rice and aged goods. A total of 50,000 bags of foreign rice were sold throughout the day, and there were also about 4,000 bags of local indica rice traded. Foreign rice rose sharply by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan due to the competition among various guilds, while local indica rice rose moderately.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Shantou Exchange Rate Falls; Chaoqing is Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was flat and weak due to the slight softening of the customs gold. The guild called for 17.6 yuan for 24 Dutch grade coarse white sugar, and 5.4 yuan for re-exported goods, but no transactions were made. Guangdong coarse white sugar from local warehouses was 17.55 yuan, and Dutch coarse white sugar from local warehouses was 17.63 yuan, both with slight transactions, but the quantity was not large. Mian White Sugar No. 1 from the local Zhenyu factory was 17.1 yuan, down 0.4 yuan, with the rest unchanged. Siming No. 1 was 16.9 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were unchanged. Siming Special Grade Yuanrun sliced ​​ice was 17 yuan per piece, the secondary brand was 15.8 yuan, Shuangfu was 23.4 yuan, No. 1 was 21.2 yuan, No. 2 was 21.1 yuan, No. 1 Ice Block was 20 yuan, No. 11 was 18.4 yuan, and Ice Scraps were 18 yuan. Because the Shantou exchange rate fell by 40 yuan in the past two days, from 1,075 yuan to 1,035 yuan, goods from Chaoqing are difficult to match. Number plates intend to tighten, resulting in a lack of openings.</p>

<h3>A History Written for Women</h3>
<p>— Ms. Da Ge</p>
<p>Chinese history books, whether it's the Seventeen Histories, Eighteen Histories, Twenty-one Histories, or Twenty-four Histories, all the way to the Twenty-five Histories and Twenty-six Histories published in bookstores recently, can be summarized as: these are all histories of men only, with little relation to women.</p>
<p>Because the facts recorded in history books are mostly praising certain emperors, lauding certain civil and military officials, defaming certain rulers, and vilifying certain military and civil officials. It all boils down to men's accounts, just the old format.</p>
<p>As for women, when they are mentioned occasionally, they are either virtuous mothers or good wives. Hua Mulan was clearly brave and martial, but she is insisted upon to be filial; Baosi rarely smiled, but she is insisted upon to have caused the downfall of King You of Zhou's kingdom.</p>
<p>Thus: women are only fit for washing clothes, cooking, and holding children. This has become the conclusion. How can they have any prospects?</p>
<p>But no! She has bumped into the top household! She can do what men can do. She kicks away the unreasonable etiquette monopolized by men without even paying attention. Moreover, she also wants to taste the imperial throne monopolized by men for so long.</p>
<p>Who is she? Wu Zetian.</p>
<p>Hearing the three words Wu Zetian, I am afraid that many people will shake their heads like a "rattle drum," right? In fact, on careful thought, it is fine to shake it slowly.</p>
<p>Let us first look at her history. - I don't have the Book of Tang on hand, so there is no way to check her detailed biography. I just opened the Ci Yuan dictionary, the "zhi" radical, "wu" category, where there is a paragraph about her (presumably based on the Book of Tang)...</p>
<p>"Empress of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, named Ying, from Xuzhou. Initially, Emperor Taizong selected her as a talented woman. When Emperor Taizong died, she had her head shaved and became a nun. During the reign of Emperor Gaozong, she returned to the palace with her hair grown back, and was soon made empress. Emperor Gaozong suffered from illness, and the empress made decisions, pleasing him. After Emperor Gaozong died, she ruled from the throne, deposed Emperor Zhongzong, changed the country's name to Zhou, indulged in licentiousness and cruelty, favored the Zhang brothers (Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong), and employed cruel officials such as Lai Junchen. However, she was rich in strategy and was able to use people, so outstanding prime ministers emerged. In her later years, the court's regulations were greatly disordered. Zhang Jianzhi and others, taking advantage of her illness, forced her to abdicate to Emperor Zhongzong. The empress also soon died. Her posthumous title was Empress Zetian."</p>
<p>This short paragraph, although very simple, allows us to understand at least three points:</p>
<p>(1) "... Initially, Emperor Taizong selected her as a talented woman... She had her head shaved and became a nun... During the reign of Emperor Gaozong, she returned to the palace with her hair grown back..." This tells us that she was a figure who struggled out of a difficult and arduous environment! The reason why her later actions were extraordinary was entirely due to the pungent foundation laid by her experiences before becoming emperor. It was by no means accidental!</p>
<p>(2) "... The empress made decisions, pleasing him. After Emperor Gaozong died, she ruled from the throne, deposed Emperor Zhongzong, changed the country's name to Zhou... She was rich in strategy and was able to use people, so outstanding prime ministers emerged..." This allows us to further know her extraordinary ruling ability and the courage to act. We know that her history, in which the male pen could write "rich in strategy and able to use people," was by no means ordinary and not easily won.</p>
<p>(3) "... Indulged in licentiousness and cruelty, favored the Zhang brothers (Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong), and employed cruel officials such as Lai Junchen..." This is probably Wu Zetian's eternal crime, right? This is probably the reason why people shake their heads as soon as they hear the three words Wu Zetian, right? In fact, on careful consideration, Wu Zetian, among emperors, should be called a believer in temperance. We often hear of ordinary emperors openly owning three palaces, six courtyards, and seventy-two concubines; but no one has ever said that they were licentious. Why is it that when Wu Zetian favored Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, she should be called "indulging in licentiousness and cruelty?" What is the reason for this? The answer is... because she was a woman. As for employing cruel officials, I cannot find an emperor in feudal society who was not cruel, no matter how beautifully those historians spoke.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I am reminded of the odiousness of ancient Chinese authors and a portion of modern authors.</p>
<p>Originally, they knew that women were capable of more than just washing clothes, cooking, and holding children. They knew that women and men should equally abide by the etiquette and laws (?). Of course, they were also clear about this in their hearts.</p>
<p>But, they insist on saying it that way.</p>
<p>Why? I think perhaps there are two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Men rely on the feudal power passed down by tradition, on the one hand oppressing men of the same sex; on the other hand, oppressing women of the opposite sex. Because they are of the opposite sex, the oppression is particularly severe. This is the common example of the big worm eating the small worm, and the hairy worm eating the mustard worm. Helplessly, there are also fierce mustard worms. Wu Zetian, after all, had been an emperor, and she dug a big hole in their divinely ordained unequal treaty. Naturally, Wu Zetian was too odious, so they added the crime of licentiousness, cruelty, and shamelessness to her. The concluding article is... "Look! What did I say? How can women succeed?"</p>
<p>(2) Authors often like to consider mawkishness interesting. No matter what a woman does, they often have to drag it in and relate it to issues such as sexuality. If men do not eradicate the traditional prejudice in their subconscious, their views on women will not improve.</p>
<h3>Became an Immortal</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>—A Record of the Trip to Daxing—</p>
<p>I have never ridden a horse, so I don't really understand "horse nature." Now, it's "bright and shiny." A horse stands on the dusky road, just waiting for me to ride it. It keeps flicking its ears and kicking its hooves, probably already starving. But when I want to ride it, I feel like I lack a bit of courage - let's just say "lack a bit." Although I don't know the "majesty on horseback," I do know a little about horse legends. Where I grew up, there is a saying that goes, "A horse is three parts dragon." It seems that horses also have some divinity. But saying only "three parts" shows that it is not exactly a dragon. I neither hate nor respect horses.</p>
<p>It is said that horses have a big temper and a violent nature. Looking at the mountain, it also has a somewhat mysterious flavor. The side that I want to walk up is facing away from the sunlight and appears very dark. It seems to be about five or six li to the top of the peak. If I am not careful, wouldn't I "fall off my horse," and if I fall down the mountain, I will truly become a pulpy mess of blood and flesh. So it is not difficult to write the poetic line "one whip in the setting sun," but the difficulty lies in how to ride up there and then use that one whip. Moreover, I have never ridden a horse before. At this time, I thought out of nowhere that it would be better to have a military parade. There must be a "groom" there who will hold the horse tightly and not let it lose its temper: I have seen it in pictorials.</p>
<p>The friend who came to pick me up and his followers were all ready and urging me on their horses with whips. It was no longer appropriate to delay, so I shrugged and straddled the saddle. Fortunately, it wasn't as fierce as I had expected, suddenly lunging forward just as someone was about to mount. I secretly thanked the horse and thanked the owner.</p>
<p>"When did this horse also become so aloof!" I said.</p>
<p>The horse shook its head very gracefully, as if protesting against me.</p>
<p>The horse and rider went up all the way, which was both a dangerous and delightful spectacle. The road twisted upwards. In addition, it had just rained, and the bald stone blocks underfoot were extremely slippery. The horse slid and fell like it was ice skating, while also having to dance the fox trot to prevent falling into the valley. The sound of hooves echoed loudly, and its majesty could only be compared to "a military march played by a horse."</p>
<p>The setting sun emitted the light of colorful silk, slanting across the top of the head in strands. The horse and rider, sliding and falling, dancing, and treading the military march, gradually approached the colorful clouds. It seemed that the horse could leap into them with one jump. Looking back down the mountain, a thick fog rose between the streams and valleys. This body floated as if it were in the clouds, and I was truly about to forget the "secular world!" I didn't know that riding a horse to climb a mountain could be so full of poetry.</p>
<p>However, this poem could not continue to be written. When it was about to set foot in the heavens, the horse stopped. It knew that the clouds were not suitable for running; it was so insensitive after all, alas!</p>
<p>During this short journey, I learned that a horse is not the same as a donkey. If it were a donkey (simply a hooligan, not only stubborn but also stupid), if it decided to slack off, it would simply throw the person off its back, as a little punishment for the one who whipped it. But a horse is different: smarter than a donkey, it understands that whipping is for getting it to move forward, not forcing it to throw itself off a cliff, so no matter how punished, it just ignores it. It stands very gracefully, still admiring the mountain scenery under the whip, and one can certainly say "It can be my teacher." Helplessly, I had to ask it to go up. When I arrived at the top of the mountain, it was already dark.</p>
<p>A star shone like a drop of mercury in the southwest. All the mountains were devoid of flying birds. In the farthest place, behind a high mountain, some faint white light remained, shining on the snowy mountain top. Fog filled the valley, and black shadows were swaying, probably groves of trees. Barking sounds came from below, making the mountain scenery even more desolate. The wind blew the horse's mane, causing it to flip over, and the tail swayed in the wind, looking like strands that were about to fall off. The perennial withered grass rustled like shivering. The horse trembled on all four hooves, looking back blankly at where it had come from, shook its head sadly, and continued to graze on the withered grass. I asked the companion, who said that there were still fifteen li of mountain to climb.</p>
<p>Now thinking back, the title should be "Picture of Riding a Horse on a Desolate Mountain," and I would play the main character in the "picture." Recharging the character of "Feng Chen Sanxia" would definitely be welcomed these days!</p>
<h3>Collected Curiosities (1) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wo Pu</p>
<p>(3) The Sky is Pale, the Clouds are Leisurely</p>
<p>Hong Fangsi's "The Palace of Eternal Life," Act 24, "Startling Change," first song, Northern Mode Zhonglü "Butterfly Love Flower"!</p>
<p>"The sky is pale, the clouds are leisurely, rows of new geese line the long sky. The autumn colors in the Imperial Garden are brilliantly variegated; the willows turn yellow, the duckweed fades green, and the red lotuses shed their petals. A touch of carved railing, the pure fragrance of osmanthus blossoms just unfurled."</p>
<p>This song is still widely circulated and sung in theaters, beloved by all. However, this song by Hong is actually a continuation and not an original creation. In the "Yongxi Yuefu," Volume 6, Northern Mode Zhonglü "Butterfly Love Flower," Yang Guifei's "Dancing Emerald Tray" suite says:</p>
<p>"The sky is pale, the clouds are leisurely, writing rows of migrating geese across the long sky. The summer scenery in the Imperial Garden begins to fade; chrysanthemums turn yellow, lotuses fade green, and autumn lotuses shed their petals. Sitting near the carved railing, surprisingly, the pure fragrance of jade hairpins just unfurled."</p>
<p>This song likely originates from Wang Bocheng's "Stories of the Heavenly Palace" in various palace modes. Comparing the lyrics with those of the "Startling Change" act, we find that: in the second line, "rows" was originally "writing" and "new" was originally "migrating"; in the third line, "autumn colors brilliantly variegated" was originally "summer scenery begins to fade"; in the fourth line, "willows" was originally "chrysanthemums"; in the fifth line, "duckweed" was originally "lotuses"; in the sixth line, "red" was originally "autumn"; in the seventh line, "a touch" was originally "sitting near," and the seventh line originally had three filler words, "surprisingly," and "osmanthus withering" was originally "jade hairpin." In total, only sixteen characters were added or changed; otherwise, they are completely identical. It seems to be a difference in the textual versions of the song, rather than two individuals' own works. From the past, it has been common to incorporate old poems and lyrics into songs, but one either quotes fragments of verses or summarizes the general meaning; a complete rewriting or embellishment of the entire play is another matter. In the example before us, like Wang Shifu's use of certain texts from Dong's "Western Chamber Romance," we do not feel much of a sense of plagiarism. While both were influenced by "various palace modes," such a complete theft of a theatrical piece is truly going too far for a talented writer. However, the altered parts can be said to surpass the original; the original "chrysanthemums turn yellow" does not seem to closely align with the early autumn season, while "duckweed" fits better, and the consecutive use of "lotuses" is also somewhat repetitive. Only the character "rows" seems, in comparison, still better than the original "writing."</p>
<p>This "Dancing Emerald Tray" suite was not included in Zheng's "Study of Palace Modes of the Song, Jin, and Yuan Dynasties" when discussing the compiled fragments of "Stories of the Tianbao Era," for reasons unknown. Zheng lamented the omission of Wang Bocheng's lyrics about "the fragrance of lychees at dawn" and the "Rainbow Skirt Dance." The "Dancing Emerald Tray" suite could have compensated for this deficiency.</p>
<p>" 'Welcoming the Immortal Guest,' the fragrant aroma is intense, the delicate colors are fresh and beautiful, as if plucked from the ninth heaven. Plucked from the ninth heaven to the human world, difficult to obtain when sought, rarely found afterward. It's a pity they don't grow in Chang'an, so I instructed the Hua envoy to peddle them through the mortal realm."</p>
<p>" 'Red Embroidered Shoes,' not offered on a golden plate, but held up in emerald sleeves for viewing. Truly, a crimson gauze covers the crystal frost. Why aren't they born in the northern lands, but instead grow in the southern regions? This is truly a rare sight."</p>
<p>Isn't this "the fragrance of lychees at dawn"? The following songs, "Happy Three," "Old Bao'er," "Ancient Bao'er," and "Red Cinnabar Medicine," vividly describe the "Dancing Emerald Tray" incident, with phrases like "compared to the Rainbow Skirt Dance in the lunar palace." It also mentions "Zheng Guanxi's pipa," "Prince Xian's jade flute," "Hua Nu's羯鼓," "Prince Ning's brocade zither," "Consort Mei's jade flute," and "Huang Fanchuo's castanets," resembling "The Rainbow Skirt and Feather Dress" in detail. Although "Dancing Tray" may have originally been a separate event, the "Rainbow Skirt" scene should have a more extensive and complex depiction in Wang's "various palace modes." However, the "Stories of the Tianbao Era" quotes the "Shaobian" suite, saying, "skillfully describes the carved tray performing the Rainbow Skirt Dance," so it cannot be said that there is no connection.</p>
<p>However, at the peak of this joy, from the song "Picking Silver Lanterns" onward, the scene suddenly changes:</p>
<p>"Picking Silver Lanterns," I heard it reported that the sky was dark and late, you always took your time; unable to wait for the feast's songs and dances to end, I rushed in, breathing heavily, disrespecting your countenance. Speak up! Qi Guan Zhong, Zheng Zichan, fake loyalists Long Feng, Bigan. "Creeping Spinach," almost frightened Zhou Gong, he said: because of singing and dancing, enamored with playing music. You always like to seize opportunities! How could you laugh and chat leisurely with a feather fan and silk scarf and defeat 300,000 fierce barbarians?"</p>
<p>"Woodpecker," at the end, carefully examining the "Riding a Horse, Petulant," how can you support the difficult Shu Road? Lofty and steep mountains connect to the cloud boardwalk, never accustomed to it, how many stages will you withdraw from Yanmen Pass?"</p>
<p>This situation clearly is also a "startling change." Doesn't the song's text clearly have Yang Guozhong in it? Before the singing and dancing ended, a panicked report came in. The "Palace of Eternal Life" play honestly follows this "Dancing Emerald Tray" suite, even in the arrangement of scenes. The epilogue:</p>
<p>"In the deep palace, always pampered and indolent, how can you support the difficult Shu Road? Consort, how will your jade softness and floral tenderness traverse the road!"</p>
<p>Is actually the original meaning of the "Woodpecker" epilogue. Based on this, it seems that Hong did actually see and utilize Tu's original work. It is feared that other parts of "The Palace of Eternal Life" could not escape this either.</p>
<p>This "Dancing Emerald Tray" suite contains the plot of a "startling change" and is extremely important in nature, as it is the key to entering Shu. Although the "Stories of the Tianbao Era" quotes the "Shaobian" suite, "skillfully describes the carved tray performing the Rainbow Skirt Dance," this event is far removed from entering Shu, and ultimately should not be placed before it. It should be placed in Zheng's compiled fragments between the twenty-eighth song "Wants to Ascend the Terrace, 'Breaks Through the Huddle Pass'," and the twenty-ninth song "Drunk in the Flower Shadow, 'Yang Guifei Mounts Her Horse at Mawei Slope'." Fragmented and incomplete, one can only piece it together with intention.</p>
<h3>These Two Sections</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Fanhai</p>
<p>Listen to fate pronounce its judgment,</p>
<p>I want to rush into the center of that black wilderness,</p>
<p>Split my eyes and scream madly!</p>
<p>I want to use both hands to grasp the pillars of heaven in hell,</p>
<p>Shake the universe,</p>
<p>Agitate the human world!</p>
<p>I ask the god of the black night:</p>
<p>Where have you hidden the sun?</p>
<p>Beneath the pillars of heaven in hell,</p>
<p>There is a blood tide of ten thousand horses galloping,</p>
<p>I see—</p>
<p>I see the selfish demon king</p>
<p>Hiding in the shadows behind the pillar, grinning ferociously at me,</p>
<p>I hear—</p>
<p>I hear the neighing of horses and the cries of people in the black wilderness!</p>
<p>I dare to ask the ruler of creation:</p>
<p>Who should I ask for freedom and fairness?</p>
<h3>Mr. Juqing (5)</h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>This unexpected blow veiled Mr. Juqing's eyes with a black cloth, making the future appear even more bleak and uncertain.</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow was the opening of the school, and after days of effort, there was still no progress. Mr. Juqing was so anxious that he seemed to have reached a dead end. Mixed in with the panic of life was an inexplicable sense of vanity; too few students would also be detrimental to his reputation. To make up for this shortcoming, he was willing to take in a few students without tuition. That day, he made an excuse to run to the home of Yun Sheng, the leatherworker next door, and said to the hunchbacked leatherworker with great sympathy:</p>
<p>"Lian Sheng, your Agou—isn't he nine years old this year?—should be going to school. As the saying goes, 'A single word is worth a thousand gold pieces.' It is important for children to study; what parent doesn't hope their son will emerge early? I know you're struggling; I won't charge you any 'book money'."</p>
<p>The leatherworker Yun Sheng raised his hunched body and said gratefully, his speech a bit "choppy":</p>
<p>"Sir, you really are, really are—, we old and young are all grateful. For the child to have books to read, that's really—, what else can I say? Studying is, 'a single word is worth a thousand gold pieces'." Saying this, his eyebrows gradually furrowed, and the words seemed stuck in his mouth, as if he couldn't get them out: "But, but, there's only my wife and I at home, and we're busy all day long; Agou has to cook at home, and, and, he has to take care of the two younger ones, it's really impossible for him to leave. Sir, you really are——really——"</p>
<p>He wanted to say a few words of gratitude, but he didn't know how to say them. Finally, he let out a sigh: "Alas!"</p>
<p>Mr. Juqing ran home in a daze, his heart so empty that he couldn't find any boundaries; his head, however, was swollen as if to be burst by this emptiness; and the world seemed stifled to the point of collapsing.</p>
<p>On the morning of the school opening day, to his surprise, a new "first writing" student arrived unexpectedly. There was no prior notice; he was only accompanied by his foreign-looking father, who said a few humble and polite words to the teacher, such as "the child doesn't understand anything, I'm relying entirely on you to discipline him strictly, feel free to beat him," then cupped his hands, left the child, and hurried away. - He took the child's first writing so casually, digging a well only when thirsty, without even formally recognizing a teacher or registering. If it had been three or four years earlier, Mr. Juqing would have refused to accept him, but the current situation was different, and he deeply felt that: the world had really changed.</p>
<p>After paying respects to Confucius, he watched the students scatter sparsely: so deserted, so declining! Last year there were more than this. This year, counting the new student, there were still five or six fewer old students. The reality had fallen into the misfortune he had foreseen. Understanding the futility of anxiety, he had no choice but to comfort himself in various ways—</p>
<p>Maybe they'll come in a few days?</p>
<p>However, seven or eight days quickly passed, and none of the missing students came. Only from the mouths of the students who had come did he hear fragmented news: Zhu Zhangsen's family was too poor, unable to make a living in the countryside, so he went to Shanghai with his mother, Eighth Aunt. Chen Zhiqing's father lost his job at the end of last year and returned to his hometown. The family had nothing to eat, causing constant turmoil, and it was unlikely he would come to school again this year. Hu Chunlin, he heard, had transferred to Mr. Nan, the Taishi's private school, lured away by Mr. Nan... For them, Mr. Juqing had no choice but to declare hopelessness.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Juqing was only thinking about one person: Zhang the Widow's only son, Zhang Wencan, the best student in the entire school. Because of his mother's strict discipline, the child himself was particularly virtuous. In the past, Zhang Wencan rarely took even half a day off. Because of his mother's fervent expectations for her child, she had earnestly said to the teacher: "A'Can is all thanks to your good teaching, sir. Our Zhang family only has this one wisp of incense left. I want to drink brine and cultivate him, let him study with you well for a few years." This most promising and contented disciple, even now, he had not seen a trace of him.</p>

<h3>New York Bans Breach of Promise Lawsuits</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Usually we meet Ph.D. and Master's degree holders from the United States, and in addition to respectfully praising how prosperous, developed, and civilized the New World is, they often boast, half with glory and half with dazzling effect, about how free and equal the people of the "Golden Country" are. Those who can't leave the country are filled with longing. For example, they say how equal men and women are there, how unrestrained women are, with many examples, such as men giving up their seats on public transportation and streetcars, men opening doors, men carrying women's purses and coats when strolling in parks, and all kinds of "expressions of respect for women's rights," all of which make us, who have always been "men superior to women," feel inferior and ashamed.</p>
<p>Yes, Anglo-Saxons are very polite to women, opening their mouths with a "Madam" and closing with a "Miss," showing a kind of "high-class servant" kind of respect for women. Wearing black top hats and white gloves, they follow step by step and speak politely, doing their best to be "gentlemen." This kind of courtesy has also become popular among higher-class Chinese people in our country, following the advocacy of "Europeanization." But is this what is called respecting women's rights and equality between men and women? I not only think it's a far cry from the truth, but also belongs to the kind of arsenic pill with a sugar coating. If you don't believe me, look at the facts:</p>
<p>Reuters New York reports that "New York Governor Lehman recently signed a ban on breach of promise lawsuits in the state. If a man's love breaks down and he wants freedom, then the so-called fiancée cannot demand money as the price of love; if such a thing happens, the woman can be accused of fraud and fined $1,000 to $5,000, or imprisoned for one to ten years. That is, women cannot accuse men of infidelity or abandonment and demand monetary compensation." Lehman did this because people often use breach of promise as a tool for extortion. According to his statistics, New York men have been extorted for no less than ten million dollars in this beauty trap. Once this law is enacted, there will no longer be men accused of breach of promise or seduction.</p>
<p>Of course, the so-called breach of promise and seduction cases that cost New York men ten million dollars arose from the "courteous and sincere" and "sweet and affectionate" politeness toward women after the men put on their "white gloves." Behind this stands the money and power of playing with women. This has not changed much because of the "liberation" of American women and "equality between men and women," as evidenced by the large number of breach of promise and seduction cases in New York.</p>
<p>These incidents of women being teased and humiliated could previously be brought to court, and although getting monetary compensation was not a victory, it could at least make those who embraced multiple women have some scruples. But now it's not possible. Accusing a man of abandonment and seduction has become extortion, punishable by fines and imprisonment; that is, it is right and proper for a man to seduce and abandon a woman. If she wants to sue, she will "lose both her wife and her soldiers"!</p>
<p>This is the equality between men and women in the Golden Country. Those in our country who have the "disease of loving women," can take a lesson from this.</p>
<h3>What I Saw in the Village</h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>Early in the morning, an old man carried a pole with burdens to a place near the city, and was dragged into the army camp by the young soldiers. What was he dragged in for? Some said he was being made a soldier, others said the army was about to set off and he was being used as a porter. No matter which it was, it was the worst possible luck.</p>
<p>This news immediately spread to the ears of everyone in the neighborhood, so everyone gathered together, their faces filled with fear, talking about it in a frenzy. Among them, a woman's hoarse voice sighed—</p>
<p>"Alas, it's been a whole year, without any news. Who dares to say if he's dead or alive? In these times, those murdering devils!—Now, it's happening again! Now, alas!"</p>
<p>Everyone's eyes focused on the woman's face, and they all held their breaths. The woman speaking, choked with painful memories, was Sister-in-law Dasheng. Her tone was hoarse, almost crying.</p>
<p>Remembering that incident was like being struck in the heart with a hammer! The year before last, Dasheng also suffered the same disaster as the old man this time. He was captured by the young soldiers, his arms tied behind his back, and taken to the army camp like a prisoner. Dasheng understood that once he went, he wouldn't be coming back, and life was the most important thing, so he begged and struggled, even kneeling down on both knees, pleading with the soldier elders to spare him. He had a wife and son at home waiting for him to support them. The soldier elders naturally didn't care about these things. Sister-in-law Dasheng followed behind them, crying and screaming all the way, her hair a mess, going crazy, but the soldier elders were unmoved and kicked Sister-in-law Dasheng heavily in the stomach, sending her crashing to the side of the road. After that, she knew little...</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Sister-in-law Danu's eyes became moist, and invisible teardrops slid around in her pupils. How could she not be sad, especially since she still had a large scar on her stomach.</p>
<p>"Oh God, who harmed my Dasheng? Those murdering devils..."</p>
<p>She muttered to herself through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>The women heard the news and hurried home, urgently warning their men:</p>
<p>—Lao Ba was arrested, it's happening again, you know? Don't go out today! Be careful.</p>
<p>—That's right, we'll have to eat the wind today. Hurry up and borrow two sheng of rice from someone, the man replied with a frown. These families were pitiful, relying on their men's strong legs and bodies, going out east, west, north, and south at dawn to carry loads for people into the city, living day by day. If anything went wrong, or if they were sick, the old and young would definitely starve. But the most frightening thing was this kind of situation.</p>
<p>Leaving aside other things, Dasheng's example was enough to leave them with a deep and unforgettable impression. Thinking about it, everyone couldn't help but tremble with cold, so the men had no choice but to hide in their houses, feeling bored, not daring to step outside for half a day. As soon as they stepped out, they were in danger of being arrested. The men became women, guarding the home.</p>
<p>Women were sent out to buy things.</p>
<p>The streets suddenly became very quiet. You couldn't see the strong men normally carrying heavy loads and sweating, only a few women running around, and the most eye-catching and frightening sight was groups of three or five soldiers, some carrying guns, some holding a string of ropes, shooting fierce glances, strutting back and forth on the streets, shouting. Occasionally, a glimpse of a man's shadow in the distance would cause them to chase after him in a frenzy, shouting "Don't go, don't go," sometimes firing a shot into the sky to scare the person running away in a desperate manner. That kind of commotion for half a day was considered lucky. If it continued, even if life was preserved, they would starve completely.</p>
<h3>Waves</h3>
<p>— Bu Yang</p>
<p>I fear waves.</p>
<p>A fragile life cannot withstand such turbulence.</p>
<p>But I cannot escape the waves' grasp.</p>
<p>Each time I muster the courage to come out and gather my weary wings to return, I am always anxiously worried about whether I will have to bring up everything I ate from the same way I swallowed it down.</p>
<p>My hometown and S Port are separated by an endless sea! That is the world of waves.</p>
<p>I have to be a prisoner in its world for one night.</p>
<p>To be prepared, I dare not drink alcohol; I even eat one less bowl of rice. The sea at sunset is covered with golden sand, magnificent, and grand. Many poets have praised it, and some have been seduced by it, but I am not fortunate enough to receive it. I fear waves.</p>
<p>I stiffly lie still on the hard wooden plank, daring not to talk much with others, blinking my eyes, helplessly waiting for the waves to come.</p>
<p>The waves of the inner river, no, they should be called ripples. Like a flirtatious courtesan, they are light and carefree, not worth mentioning.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Once out to sea, it's different, like a giant spirit waving an iron fan, the entire thousand-ton ship goes forward staggering like a drunkard.</p>
<p>In the staggering, my head starts to feel strange.</p>
<p>The engine sound and the wave sound fight each other through a layer of iron plate, cups and cups fight on the table, the body is like an ingot: the head sinks down, the feet stick up, the feet sink down, the head sticks up, the inventory in the stomach is sent to the throat step by step.</p>
<p>——Tonight's waves are very big.</p>
<p>The waiter says, putting the cups into the drawer and taking down the things hanging up.</p>
<p>I put all my strength into holding back my throat, only allowing breathing to take a one-way trip through my nostrils.</p>
<p>Under this extreme endurance, I reach the other shore. But I must be grateful: I didn't bring up what I ate from the same way I swallowed it down.</p>
<p>Perhaps this disappointed the waves? But it is a fact that its authority cannot encroach on land.</p>
<p>I fear the huge waves of reality even more.</p>
<p>It is a demon king who controls great power, and its authority does not distinguish between water and land. It will bring a person back from the same way they came, alive.</p>
<p>Endure? Is that endless shrinking back impossible to resist? A small boat without a rudder cannot be compared to a thousand-ton giant ship. So, I have no choice but to cling to the oars, sink and float with it, drifting, drifting. If I am not careful, there is a danger of drowning: like my brother's recent unemployment is an ironclad proof. Of course, my brother is not the only one who is unemployed.</p>
<p>What I feel from that is not dizziness, but the trembling of my whole soul, not vomiting, but the approaching of hunger. Not the clashing of cups and cups, but the clash of teeth and teeth? It is not the ship that goes to break the waves, but the waves that come to crash on the ship. One night of turbulence is easy to get through, but a lifetime of drifting is difficult to endure.</p>
<p>An unstable life, an unhealthy environment, so I am always being played with by the waves.</p>
<p>Each time, I am always worried that the waves will extinguish everything, but I cannot let go of others, I am unwilling to quietly return from the same way I came. At the same time, for the sake of others, I must endure and live a wretched life, endlessly living a life in the waves.</p>
<h3>Tempering</h3>
<h3>Beggar</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>The light from the electric lamp in the small restaurant appears especially dim. The waiters are busily carrying the stir-fried vegetables from the kitchen to the tables. Bowls of snow-white rice are sent from the rice bucket into people's stomachs.</p>
<p>Outside the door is an asphalt road, and several pedestrians are walking back and forth. On the other side of the road is a railway, and a train coming from Jiangwan just passed by, emitting a sharp whistle.</p>
<p>A beggar walks to the door of the small restaurant, leans against the wall, peeking into the restaurant, silently, silently.</p>
<p>Perhaps the aroma of vegetables and rice arouses the beggar's hunger! Surely, he can't bear the pain in his heart, so he begins to beg to the waiter who is busy carrying vegetables.</p>
<p>"Ah. Ah, ah, ah——" The beggar is a mute! He opens his throat and screams straight.</p>
<p>The people eating are still eating, the people carrying vegetables are still carrying vegetables, no one is paying attention to him.</p>
<p>"Ah, ah——ah!" The sound is even louder! He points his finger at his mouth and then at his stomach, then opens his hand: "Ah, ah, ah, ah——"</p>
<p>"Go away! There's nothing here!" A waiter scolds him.</p>
<p>"Ah, ah——" The beggar does not move his body. Yes, he wants to get people's sympathy, he wants people to pity him. He thinks scolding is very normal.</p>
<p>"Ah——"</p>
<p>The waiter is a little impatient.</p>
<p>"Get out!" With a bang, the door closes.</p>
<p>The beggar's face is revealed from outside the glass. Still screaming.</p>
<p>Many people's stomachs are full, and they happily walk out. The people carrying vegetables are still busy.</p>
<p>Finally, the beggar's shadow disappears into the darkness.</p>
<p>The mute is pitiful.</p>
<h3>Minor Employee</h3>
<p>— Ben Gao</p>
<p>As soon as there was a hint of milky white light on the window, Li Ying got out of bed. He opened his drowsy, weary eyes and listlessly scanned the simple bedroom. He saw his frail old mother groaning softly in her sleep, mixed with ear-piercing rattling sounds. Her illness was severe. He felt she needed someone to be by her side constantly, but if he didn't work for a day, his life would become even more problematic. Moreover, there were especially many documents to write today. Last night, Chief Wang had said to him when he got home: "Li Ying, you should come earlier tomorrow, there are many documents for you to write." This made him have to steel his heart and leave his ailing mother temporarily. So, he put on a greasy jacket and reluctantly left home.</p>
<p>On the road, he thought of the gloomy atmosphere of the office, and the stern faces of his superiors, as cold as judges interrogating criminals, which made him feel an immense emptiness in his heart. Furthermore, everyone in the office, big or small, seemed to hold him in a kind of contempt. Even the tea boy, who was at everyone's beck and call, only flattered those gentlemen with protruding bellies and snow-white cigarettes in their mouths, their faces full of official airs. When he saw Li Ying, he would always pass by without even raising his head. At most, he would give a mumbled greeting. Therefore, when going home or leaving for work, he was always worried he would run into them on the road. Even if he did encounter them by chance, he always lowered his head, not wanting to see them clearly. He was afraid of their arrogant expressions and unnatural greetings. Sometimes, he would stubbornly think: "I will break away! I am determined to break away from this snobbish place. I would rather starve at home!" However, as soon as he thought of his livelihood and his old mother's illness, his courage would dissipate.</p>
<p>He entered the office, and it was only seven o'clock. There wasn't a single person there. As he carefully hunched over a small desk, transcribing documents, he thought again of his sick mother, who needed to see a doctor for treatment. But his monthly salary of fifteen dollars was simply not enough to cover it. The weather was getting cold, and he was only wearing a thin jacket. How could he afford to invite those doctors who charged several dollars at a time? But his mother's illness was getting worse day by day, and he couldn't just watch her die. He felt that he had no choice but to endure the shame and beg Chief Wang for an advance on next month's salary.</p>
<p>Chief Wang had not yet arrived. The clock had already struck eleven. The staff of the various departments had arrived one after another, and the quiet office was immediately filled with the sounds of conversation, laughter, and a strong aroma of cigarettes. Their talking and laughing made him feel especially lonely and pitiful. He didn't dare cough casually, for fear of disturbing their lively conversation and receiving an extremely unpleasant look.</p>
<p>Chief Wang arrived. He swaggered into the office, glancing around. Although this was Chief Wang's habit, today, his piercing gaze fell on Li Ying, making him feel uneasy, as if his inner thoughts had been seen through. Even when his colleagues glanced at him occasionally while whispering to each other, he suspected they were talking about him. But he warned himself: "You are too weak! What is there to be afraid of? Even if he doesn't lend it to you, you have to ask." So, he decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>His mother's illness had been seen to. However, Li Ying was again worried about next month's expenses.</p>

<p>Marquis of Xi Attacks Zheng (Continued)</p>
<p>Xi, as Xi, is extremely insignificant. Situated between great powers, it trembles with fear, still fearing it cannot protect itself. How could it dare compete with others? When Zheng opposed the alliance, it was able to maintain the usual position of a small state. Then Zheng would inevitably not oppose Xi. Xi might not have been defeated by Zheng. Now, it cannot overcome a moment's anger, forgets its smallness, and offends the great. It is fitting that it invites its own defeat, and the blame for the five unrighteousnesses all falls on its head. However, Zheng and Xi have conflicting words. Zheng does not send troops against Xi. Xi instead first sends troops against Zheng. Why is that? It is because the heart of a small country always suspects others of bullying it. Therefore, anger is easily born. This is why Xi's troops acted first. This heart is not unique to the Marquis of Xi. Of all the things people in difficult circumstances find most unfair, nothing is more unbearable than being bullied by others. I will explain it to them. When you are in a position of wealth and power, those who fawn upon you are not fawning upon you, but upon your wealth and power. When you are in a position of poverty and insignificance, those who bully you are not bullying you, but bullying your insignificance. How do I know this is true? If I am first wealthy and then impoverished, my being is still the same, but those who fawned upon me suddenly change and begin to bully me. Then, looking back at those who fawned upon me in the past, were they truly fawning upon me? If I am first insignificant and then wealthy, those who bullied me suddenly change and begin to fawn upon me. Then, looking back at those who bullied me in the past, were they truly bullying me?</p>

<p>Shen Bao This Locality Supplement Movie Special Issue</p>
<h3>The Six Stars Awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1934 (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>(1) Prior Brewing</p>
<p>Starting in 1935, Hollywood immediately began paying attention to the selection of movie stars by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to be commended for the year 1934. Therefore, at that time, we could hear people everywhere on the streets and alleys of Hollywood discussing which star should be commended and which directors and their productions should be included, because the list of winners would be decided on February 27.</p>
<p>Katharine Hepburn was last year's female star award winner, for her performance in The Little Minister, which happened to be released in Los Angeles within the prescribed period, so people speculated beforehand that she had hopes of winning again. As for her earlier work last year, Spitfire, it lacked the possibility of winning.</p>
<p>Charles Laughton, the best male actor of 1933, for his performance in The Barretts of Wimpole Street, had considerable success and there were calls for him to win again.</p>
<p>Dana Wynyard and Myrna Loy, who were as dazzling and selected as Katharine Hepburn last year, also had considerable hopes this year. As for the male stars competing with Charles Laughton, there was Leslie Howard, because his performance in Our Fuman Bondage had good results. At the same time, Paul Muni and other stars thought they had no hope of being included in the forefront.</p>
<p>Among the female stars who could win awards, Bette Davis for her performance in Our Fuman Bondage, Anna Sten for her performance in We Live Again, Claudette Colbert for her performance in Imitation of Life, and Grace Moore for her performance in One Night of Love, all had high hopes.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Ann Harding, Helen Hayes, and several others also had hopes of being selected, and Loretta Young for her The White Parade could also receive honors.</p>
<p>Among the male stars, the preliminary predictions were that Charles Laughton for The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Wallace Beery for Viva Villa, George Arliss for The House of Rothschild, Claude Rains for Man Who Reclaimed His Head, and Will Rogers for David Harum and Judge Priest all had hopes of winning.</p>
<p>In addition, Robert Donat for The Count of Monte Cristo had considerable hope, and Frederic March's honorable works were many. In addition to Design for Living and We Live Again, The Barretts of Wimpole Street also made it possible for him to win an award.</p>
<p>In the past year, regarding the issue of artistic selection of film actors, due to film censorship, there was an interesting thing, that the Our Fuman Bondage, starring Leslie Howard and Bette Davis, was regarded by the church as an unclean film. The Academy's selection methods have always been based on the value of the production and performance as the standard, and all other issues are not considered, but this year, this aspect cannot be ignored!</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>Review of "Pearl Island Part Two"</h3>
<p>— Hualun</p>
<p>Pirate Treasure</p>
<p>Comparatively speaking, this second part of "Pearl Island" Pirate Treasure is slightly better than the first. I think, if the playwright could cut out the lengthy and unnecessary stories in the whole play, and excise some of the performances of the protagonist Richard, then these two parts, consisting of more than twenty chapters, could be technically organized into a script that can be shown in one go. In this way, among the general martial arts and adventure films, this "Pearl Island Part Two" may be able to stand in a higher position.</p>
<p>The reason why this second part is better than the first is that the directing technique is more advanced and not as straightforward as the first part. There is still some drama to watch. Of course, in this film that excels in displaying martial arts skills, the so-called drama is very limited. Here, such as in the process of departure, when the ship discovered that the bad lawyer Bryce and a group of villains were lurking under the deck, the fighting between the two sides, and the mutual fighting and killing to seize the treasure after reaching the destination, etc., are still repetitive and superfluous.</p>
<p>One point, which is quite serious, is that after Dick and the others used the natives, especially the power of the chief, to subdue the enemy Bryce and his group, and obtained chests full of pearls, they would actually save Bryce and the others from the hands of the natives. What does this tell the audience? Is the playwright expressing Dick and the shipowner's great kindness? No! In the contradiction over small treasures, he and the villain Bryce are enemies; after this small contradiction has been resolved, when the issue faces the colored people of the natives, they are, after all, colorless White people! "Treasure, beauty, authority"! This authority must be expressed to people of color to be particularly prominent and tasteful.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be pointed out that certain scenes in this film, such as the native songs and dances, are cut from other films, and because there is no selection, there are still inevitable traces of ridiculousness!</p>
<h3>Theme Panic The Rise of Chinese Literary Films</h3>
<p>— Process</p>
<p>In recent years, the trend of adapting literary works to the screen and making them into films has been very popular in Hollywood. In the past few months, the films of this kind that have been screened in this city, just the ones that are most popular, can be counted to at least two dozen, such as Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, R.L. Stevenson's Treasure Island, Meg Ayala's Broken Hairpin, Mahan's Our Mutual Friend, as well as The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Don Quixote, Little Women, Nana, The Count of Monte Cristo, Of Human Bondage, Resurrection, etc. In particular, Tolstoy's Resurrection has even been filmed three or four times. Therefore, we can know how the filmmakers are digging in the field of literature, and relying on the fame of those acclaimed masters and the deep impression of their immortal works, to find the audience.</p>
<p>This really proves how panicked they (the filmmakers) have become in terms of themes, and at the same time, they also understand that the previous type of vulgar detective, martial arts, song, and dance films can no longer capture the audience's interest, so they turned to this path.</p>
<p>However, we know that if the style of Hollywood films can gradually move in this direction, this is indeed a good phenomenon, and it is much stronger than the production policy of detective, martial arts, song, and dance films.</p>
<p>According to recent news, there are two literary works that are very worthy of recommendation to the audience that will be screened in this city. One is Fannie Hurst's Imitation of Life, which is a very serious discussion of issues such as "black and white races" and "maternal love." One is George Cukor's David Copperfield, which is a very tragic masterpiece by the British romantic novelist Dickens (David Copperfield has had a Chinese translation by Lin Qinnan published by Commercial Press many years ago), and this is not the first time his work has been brought to the screen.</p>
<h3>Jin Cheng Re-screens "Song of the Fishermen"</h3>
<p>"The Fugitive" will continue to be shown on another day</p>
<p>This city's theaters and film companies, especially on Sunday morning at ten o'clock, held a meeting at the Jincheng Grand Theater on Beijing Road to welcome Tao Bojun, our country's representative to the Soviet Russian International Film Exhibition. During the meeting, Tao reported in detail on the exhibition and the Soviet Russian film and theater business. The theater has already begun re-screening the "Song of the Fishermen," which won an honorary award at the film exhibition, for several days, and will also add two volumes of Miss Ruan Lingyu's mourning record. As for "The Fugitive," which is being screened at the theater, it is also the most honorable production of the Yihua Company. Since its public release, it has been very popular with the public, and the box office was still full yesterday. Therefore, the theater has specially asked the Yihua Company to continue showing "The Fugitive" after "Song of the Fishermen" has finished screening.</p>
<h3>Introducing "David Copperfield"</h3>
<p>— Yunshui</p>
<p>Regarding the works of the great English writer Charles Dickens, especially "A Tale of Two Cities" and "David Copperfield," there is a great understanding in our country. The former is a historical novel that focuses on describing the French Revolution, while "David Copperfield" is nothing less than Dickens writing his own biography. Therefore, when that work begins, it is stated that the author himself said that every parent in the world has a beloved child; my beloved child is David Copperfield, and so on. At the same time, this publication has already provided a lot of introductions to the work's literary status and its acting, special style, and so on. Now the great work has arrived in Shanghai and will be shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the New Era Company</h3>
<p>— Jiweng</p>
<p>Ye Qianyu, manager of the New Era Company, and Tang Jie, director, left Shanghai together the night before, Ye went to Beiping, and Tang went to Nanjing, to observe the location shooting of the new film after "Mr. Wang Spends the New Year."</p>
<p>The New Era Company's debut work, "Mr. Wang's Secret," has not appeared for a long time since it was screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater. It has recently been heard that it will soon meet the audience again at the Central Grand Theater.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang Spends the New Year" is a further work by the New Era Company. The film's humorous gags are better than Laurel and Hardy. Among them, Mr. Wang's cloud flight scene is unprecedented in the history of Chinese cinema. The cloud and mist technique was created by the film's young photographer Chen Chen, who racked his brains to research it. (Correct)</p>

<h3>Elegy of Life (3)</h3>
<p>— Peiyuan</p>
<p>After a few very slow days, Qiao Jie returned with a worried expression, having failed in more than ten attempts. However, Meng Ou had found a position as a professor of solid geometry at Jianghai University. But Meng Ou had little research in solid geometry, so although he had secured the position, he was somewhat anxious. Therefore, he intensified his practice in the few days before he had to teach. However, he lacked the necessary specialized books. Qiao Jie and Su Qiu came up with a plan to borrow them from friends and the library separately. After the books were borrowed, Meng Ou studied and practiced diligently, not sleeping even when it was past midnight.</p>
<p>On this day, Meng Ou went to Jianghai University to teach. The principal, as usual, introduced him to the students, praising Meng Ou as a famous modern domestic solid geometry scholar. After the principal introduced Meng Ou to the students, Meng Ou began to teach. However, these students recognized Meng Ou as the one who played Qu Yuan in "The Goddess" and whispered among themselves. Seeing the students whispering, Meng Ou became even more anxious, and the formula he wrote on the blackboard was already wrong. At this moment, a student stood up and said to Meng Ou, "We know that you are a famous artist, please tell us something about the art of opera outside of class!" Meng Ou replied, "But now is class time." Then he added, "I will talk about it in detail next time." As a result, Meng Ou felt unable to fulfill the duties of the position and resigned.</p>
<p>At this time, Su Qiu secured a temporary teaching position at a small school with a monthly salary of only fifteen yuan. However, in addition to teaching, the job also included the duties of a servant, cook, and seamstress. Because Su Qiu had been unemployed for a long time, she did not feel any hardship from such a harsh job. However, before long, the original teacher who was on leave returned to the school. Although the school authorities expressed great admiration for Su Qiu's hard work and were reluctant to let her go, they had to give her up due to insufficient school funds.</p>
<p>The second landlord came to ask for money again. Meng Ou just sat blankly on the chair, not knowing what to say in response. Under the landlord's urgent demand for rent, Qiao Jie had no choice but to sell some of the Chinese and Western books he had read in school to a junk collector. Books worth more than a hundred yuan were only sold for a few yuan to the landlord by the junk collector, but the landlord still did not agree. At this time, Su Qiu returned from school with her salary of ten yuan for less than a month. After Su Qiu gave all ten yuan to the landlord, the landlord left reluctantly. In desperation, Meng Ou sold his last remaining beloved violin. When he sold it to the buyer, and the buyer asked him to play a tune for him, his tears burst out. Su Qiu and Qiao Jie also shed tears like broken beads, but some other neighbors laughed mockingly.</p>
<p>The next morning, Su Qiu was the first to discover Qiao Jie's disappearance. She only found a letter left by Qiao Jie, which read: "Meng Ou: In a situation where rice costs twenty yuan per dan, I can no longer bear to stay in your home and take away a portion of your food. Although you and your wife still take care of me so sincerely, this only increases my pain. My future is still very uncertain, but I have to leave. Goodbye, my dear friend."</p>
<p>Time flies quickly. In a blink of an eye, several years have passed, and Meng Ou and Su Qiu are still struggling in the painful life of unemployment. At the same time, they have added another burden, and that is having a child. One day, Su Qiu saw an advertisement in the recruitment column for a tutor at a certain mansion, so she went to apply. As a result, Su Qiu was hired. But coincidentally, this mansion was the mansion of Liu Rongmanna. Because Liu Rongmanna did not recognize Su Qiu, when Meng Ou asked Su Qiu what mansion she was working as a teacher in, Su Qiu hid the fact that it was Manna's mansion, fearing that it would stir up his old hatred.</p>
<p>Su Qiu went to Manna's mansion every day to teach her children and also brought her own child. Children do not understand nobility, lowliness, wealth, or poverty. Sometimes Manna's children played with many toys, and Su Qiu's child wanted to play too. When Manna's children did not allow him to play, they began to compete and fight. Although Su Qiu's child was knocked to the ground by Manna's child and cried, Su Qiu dared not speak up. The pain in her heart is truly indescribable! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Common Problems and Repair Methods for Automobile Engines</h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>When driving a car, various difficulties often arise. Most of these difficulties occur within the engine. The causes are complex. For example, difficulties in starting the engine. However, if after a difficulty occurs, a systematic search is conducted in various parts of the engine, it is not difficult to immediately discover the cause of the difficulty, and then think of a remedy. Most inexperienced drivers, when encountering any difficulty with the engine, recklessly use the brakes or violently shake the crankshaft. Such rash actions must not be used before you have discovered the cause, because sometimes they can cause severe damage to your brakes. This must be noted.</p>
<p>The main causes of automobile engine problems are nothing more than (1) engine problems, (2) combustion system difficulties, (3) carburetor internal changes. According to common practice, one can first inspect the combustion system, then the carburetor, and finally the engine body. The following is a list of commonly encountered engine problems and their causes. As for the remedies, they are detailed after the list.</p>
<p>Phenomenon Causes and Parts Analysis of Causes</p>
<p>Engine problems (A) Combustion system difficulties (1) Are there any short circuits or excessively large gaps in the spark plugs? (2) Is the wire broken or touching iron? (3) Is the distributor dirty?</p>
<p>(B) Carburetor internal failure</p>
<p>(1) Is there water accumulation in the carburetor? (2) Is the small tube clean? (3) Is there gas or pressure in the carburetor? (4) Is the gasoline supply too low? (5) Is there a bubble blockage in the small tube?</p>
<p>(C) Engine body changes</p>
<p>(1) Is the engine ambient temperature too low? (2) Is the intake valve spring dirty or damaged?</p>
<p>Carburetor too early (A) Combustion system difficulties (1) Is the wiring wrong? (2) Is the combustion sequence of the cylinders reversed?</p>
<p>Combustion (B) Carburetor internal failure (1) Is there water accumulation in the carburetor? (2) Is the fuel line dirty and blocked? (3) Is there no pressure or gas in the carburetor? (4) Is the gasoline supply insufficient?</p>
<p>Engine internal collision (C) Engine body changes (1) Is the intake valve spring dirty or damaged? (A) Combustion system difficulties (1) Combustion too early (B) Engine body changes (1) Carbon accumulation in the cylinders (combustion too early), (2) Engine overheating, (3) Bearings too loose, (4) Pistons loose</p>
<p>Engine lacks ability to supply power</p>
<p>(A) Combustion system part (1) Spark detonation slows down</p>
<p>(B) Carburetor part (1) Too much gasoline supply, fuel line closed</p>
<p>(C) Engine part (1) Exhaust valve does not work well (2) Too much carbon accumulation in the cylinders (3) Engine overheating (4) Lack of lubricating oil (5) Adjuster does not work well</p>
<p>Engine temperature too high</p>
<p>(D) Brake part (1) Is there any obstruction?</p>
<p>(E) Meshing standard part (1) Slipping action</p>
<p>(A) Combustion system part (1) Spark detonation decreases</p>
<p>(B) Carburetor part (1) Too much gasoline supply</p>
<p>(C) Engine part (1) Condenser does not work well (fan belt loose, insufficient circulating water volume) (2) Carbon accumulation in the cylinders (3) Poor lubrication</p>
<p>Engine suddenly stops</p>
<p>(A) Engine and car body stop slowly (1) Lack of fuel</p>
<p>(B) Engine and car body stop suddenly (1) Mechanical failure</p>
<p>(C) Engine suddenly stops, car body (1) Combustion system failure stops slowly</p>
<p>Engine does not stop advancing</p>
<p>(A) Combustion system part (1) Wire broken (2) Switch mechanism ineffective</p>
<p>(B) Combustion too early (1) Too much carbon accumulation in the cylinders (2) Engine overheating</p>
<p>The above are several engine problem phenomena and causes. What methods should be used to identify them? This is very simple, and any car driver (with or without car knowledge) can clearly identify various difficulties as long as they pay attention to the following points.</p>
<p>If the engine gradually stops working while the car is running, then some or all of the engine's cylinders must have encountered problems. Perhaps the combustion is not timed correctly or the valve is stuck. The problematic cylinder can be determined by placing a screw on each plug and short-circuiting them (one end connected to the center electrode of the plug, and the other end touching the electrode on the engine). If it has no effect on the engine, then this cylinder has no explosion. Then inspect the combustion system. Move the wire on the plug close to the center electrode to see if there is a spark. If there is, then this plug must be "short-circuited," which means that the plug has too much carbon accumulation or the insulator is broken. If there is no spark, then the difficulty must not be on the plug but on the parts above. If only one cylinder in the engine does not explode, then it may be a problem between the distributor and the plug. First, inspect whether the distributor is clean and whether the wiring is touching iron or the outer skin is broken.</p>
<p>The most accurate method for measuring spark plug problems is to exchange the plugs on the non-exploding and exploding cylinders. If the second cylinder also does not explode, then the plug must be cleaned carefully or replaced with a new one.</p>
<p>If no defects are found in the combustion system, the second step is to use the hand-cranked crankshaft to observe whether the compression in each cylinder is the same. Poor compression is due to leakage of the pistons and the sluggishness of the valves. This makes the engine lack power but has no effect on the cylinder explosion. Improper valve position is the real reason why the cylinder does not explode. These valves can be easily repaired with tools.</p>
<p>If the engine stops and starts intermittently, it is caused by water accumulation in the carburetor or poor gasoline flow. This can be repaired at any time. Sometimes, after the engine starts, it often stops. This is due to the engine temperature being too low. This is only a short-term problem and nothing else.</p>
<p>If the engine ignites too early, you can first inspect the route and ignition sequence chart. Perhaps the electromagnetic standard is slipping. Sometimes, too much water accumulation in the carburetor and sudden stop of gasoline supply can also cause ignition to occur too early.</p>
<p>Most of the above-mentioned car engine difficulties have been completely covered. There are many methods of repair. In summary: (1) Remove carbon deposits - If there are carbon deposits in the cylinder, you can first remove the cylinder head and use manual methods or hydrogen to remove them. After most of the carbon is removed, lightly wipe with kerosene to remove very small carbon debris. The carbon deposits on the valve can be wiped off with a swab. The action must be light and careful. (2) Pay attention to the fuel supply system - Gasoline must be filtered before entering the fuel tank. The water accumulated in the carburetor must be drained frequently. (3) Inspect the wiring - Various wiring, such as brake, light, and combustion system wiring, should be inspected frequently. Grounded phenomena must be avoided at all times. If the outer skin of the wire is slightly damaged, it must be replaced with a new wire immediately. Do not accumulate oil and other unclean objects on the wiring. The joints at the ends of the wires should be welded with metal. (4) Inspect the spark plugs - Spark plugs are important. They should be kept clean at all times and should not have carbon debris attached. The porcelain on the plugs should not be broken. When cleaning the plugs, be sure to remove them gently and wipe them with gasoline. The distance between the two plugs should be one thirty-second of an inch to one sixty-fourth of an inch.</p>
<p>There are many other small details. Due to limited space, they cannot all be listed. The above points are the most important. If you pay attention to them at all times, most engine problems can be avoided.</p>
<h3>Overview of the 1935 Graham Eight-Cylinder New Car</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Regarding automobiles, the general public has always had a discriminatory view and not without doubts. But since the 1935 Graham straight-eight-cylinder new car was presented to the world, all kinds of doubts have now been dispelled. The operating performance of the new car, although not different from the expensive sports car, is</p>
<p>The left picture shows the Dodge five-seater touring sedan, with a wheelbase of one hundred and twenty-eight inches, and the passenger compartment is extremely spacious and comfortable.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Slightly different. But its quietness, smoothness, and sturdiness. As well as the ease of starting from cold. And the economy of gasoline consumption. Are all outstanding and unrivaled. The advantages of the new car are numerous. Now, I will briefly describe its general situation.</p>
<p>Eight-cylinder engine. Equipped with parallel valves. Aluminum cylinder head. And a balanced crankshaft with five bearings. The carburetor is centrifugal. The rotary pivot is made of high tensile strength aluminum alloy. It is driven at five and three-quarters times the speed of the crankshaft. Therefore, when the engine is at 4,000 revolutions per minute. Producing a maximum actual horsepower of one hundred and thirty-five horsepower. Its drive is 23,000 revolutions per minute. Although there is such high speed. But the carburetor usually makes no noise. Even when driving fast on the road. Only a slight sound is emitted. Rotary pivot shell. Covered with a water jacket. The engine will still start immediately after being stopped for a considerable amount of time. Without stopping anywhere. The gearbox is a dedicated three-speed type. Equipped with no sound second gear. And a synchronized top gear and second gear (single-disc clutch. And a free wheel can be optionally installed. If using an intermediate gear ratio, the speed can reach six thousand miles per hour.</p>
<p>The entire sedan is symmetrical. The appearance is extremely beautiful and moving. The whole car uses safety glass. Ventilation wings. Hinged on the screen pillars. The rear quarter windows can be hinged outward. The interior is extremely comfortable. All accessories are available. The dashboard is centered with a large speedometer. Which includes a fuel gauge, etc. There are racks on both sides of the rear seat. And a folding armrest in the middle. The car body is a paper composite. The structure is extremely strong and consolidated. The joints are completely insulated. The folding luggage rack is its standard equipment. But if you want to modify it into a built-in luggage compartment. Just add a small fee. Can be changed accordingly. In addition, special parts are provided for optional use. Including a second spare wheel. Color wings. Genuine leather or perforated leather backrest, etc. In short, the Graham new car. Is a truly excellent structure with excellent structure, complete equipment, great effect, and high value that can truly satisfy people.</p>
<p>The above picture shows the 1935 Ford V-8 truck, which is particularly heavy-duty, with forty-nine improved features, and is designed to make the load distribution appropriate, easy to drive, increase engine efficiency, and make the driver more comfortable and safe. The distance between the front and rear wheels is one hundred and fifty-seven inches, equipped with a railing body and compound rear wheels.</p>
<h3>Talking about Luxurious Sedans</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Most welcomed by car enthusiasts</p>
<p>There are many types of car styles. Which one is most popular among car enthusiasts? Regarding this level, it can be observed from the sales report of various styles of Austin and all equipment recently released by Austin Motor Company, one of the world's largest automobile manufacturers.</p>
<p>According to the company's report, luxurious sedans are currently one of the most popular styles. Taking Austin products as an example, the demand for 7 horsepower models is even more urgent than that of 10 horsepower four-cylinder models. If there is one person who purchases a sedan with a fixed roof and no special modifications, then there should be six to seven people who need a luxurious model. As for the comparison between convertibles and sedans, the sales volume of sedans is thirteen vehicles, while the sales volume of convertibles is only one vehicle. According to overseas trade, the sales volume of convertibles will of course increase, but compared with sedans, it is still far behind, because if one convertible is sold, the sales volume of sedans is four vehicles, still reaching a ratio of four to one. As for the color, black is currently the most popular, but emerald blue is now loved by the general public. If this trend continues unchanged, there may be a possibility of replacing black. In addition, brown, green, and gray are also popular.</p>
<h3>The Lineup of the British Automobile Industry in 1935</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>The Twin-Synclough Automobile Manufacturing Plant has had amazing achievements in the past. The 1935 Twin-Synclough will present a unique color in the British automobile industry. What is now determined is more than tens of thousands of chassis and more than sixty types of bodies. There is also a type of passenger car chassis. The possibility of flexible matching that can be disassembled and assembled on various chassis. Repair is especially convenient. And each car can be interchanged. Each type can be moved. There are various lengths of wheelbase. Four-cylinder six-six-cylinder parts. Products using gasoline or other fuels. In order to allow customers to choose at will.</p>
<p>The Planet Automobile Manufacturing Industry occupies a glorious reputation in the British automobile industry. In the past, Planet cars have won more than one hundred and thirty car races. The Little Planet car has always been a well-known car in the world. Together with Austin small cars, they are world-renowned cars with good efficiency. The 1935 Planet Automobile Manufacturing Industry also has expansion plans. There are also various reform directions in its manufacturing. Such as the streamlining of car bodies in order to adapt to the trend of the times. And improving the mechanical parts. So that the efficiency is more improved, and the decoration of the car body is especially emphasized. Such as the ingenious matching of springs. And the force ball is smooth and unimpeded in the friction parts. Reduce resistance. Although the overall structure remains the same as before without major changes. There are many small innovations.</p>
<p>The car manufacturing department of the Duo Baota Factory is a very important car manufacturing industry in Britain in recent years. It has been changing with each passing day since 1933. The progress is beyond words. The Duo Baota Automobile Manufacturing Department in 1934 was more than twice as large as in 1933. This was already one of the surprises in the automobile industry. And at the end of 1934, it was decided to expand its direction. Now, in 1935, the Duo Baota Factory will increase its workers by 50%. And will expand the entire factory by one time. The current Duo Ta Factory is setting up branches. The main products of the factory are car accessories. Such as the spring equipment of Marius and Standard, which are all produced by Duo Baota Factory. The 1935 version of this product will definitely have more precise and amazing development.</p>
<p>Marius Automobile is also a famous member of the soda industry in recent years. Its reputation in 1934 also showed no weakness. Therefore, the innovation plan in 1935 is also quite meticulous. The current Marius soda 1935 model has been decided. However, the decision was made earlier. Now we will greatly modify the already decided 1935 model car. Although the first batch has been produced. The modification is not difficult. The person in charge of the factory said. The price of Marius cars is slightly more expensive than other soda cars. However, if the quality of the car is considered, there is no situation where the price is not high. The manufacturing plan of Marius cars does not aim for temporary profits. But only to serve the society permanently. Therefore, after the tax rate was reduced in 1935, the amount of the reduction was used for the vigorous innovation of various parts of the car. So that car owners do not suffer losses.</p>
<p>Today, most ordinary cars are equipped with gasoline engines on the machinery for transporting cars. Now, the British AEC heavy oil engine transport car has been launched. The factory produced the principle of this engine. Using the isolation method to make the corresponding pressure penetrate the air. And increase the rotation speed, the fuel is transported evenly. The action is also completely consistent. And there is no smell of anthracite coal. Now most of the buses in the UK use this heavy oil engine, and the four-cylinder bus with 75 horsepower has great power. In 1935, the Leilete factory also worked hard on the heavy oil engine plan. I am afraid that in the future the world's transport cars will be completely of this style.</p>
<p>In addition, the oil pumping pipe of the Alec Oil Company is also a brand new development in the British automobile industry. This oil pumping pipe has been proven to be a wonderful invention. Cars that need to carry a large amount of goods. Those who need to travel long distances. When there are obstacles in the middle, the installation of the oil pumping pipe can avoid various bad obstacles and increase the starting ability of the machine. The factory will also make a huge contribution in 1935.</p>
<h3>Chevrolet Seven-Seater Sedan Launched</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the Far East market, the American General Motors Manufacturing Plant has specially produced a 1935 Chevrolet seven-seater luxurious sedan. Specially for Far East customers to purchase. The car's wheelbase is 124 and three-quarters inches. The car body style is beautiful. The seats are spacious and comfortable. The entire car structure is suitable for the conditions of the Far East highways. There is also a five-seater sedan convertible. The wheelbase is also 124 and three-quarters inches. The interior is especially spacious. It is most suitable for military use in the interior. This kind of enlarged passenger car will soon be shipped to China. From then on, the Chevrolet car, which has always been famous for its petite and exquisite features, will also be among the giant cars at the same time.</p>
